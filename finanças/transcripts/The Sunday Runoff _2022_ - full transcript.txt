【The Sunday Runoff】 Did your child have been born? She's already four years old now. Really? Kids grow up so fast. And she's really smart, aiming to get into a private elementary school. Your child couldn't possibly get in. She's smart, unlike me. People should know their own limitations. No, she will definitely get in. Alright, if she really gets in, tell me a wish, and I'll do it. - Really? - Only one, though. Thank you, Councilman. Sorry for keeping you all waiting. She should be here soon. Will the other council members come as well? Yes. Who are the other council members? The county council's Councilman Ikeda and Councilman Morishita, and the city council's Councilman Ishibashi and Councilman Hamada. Understood. By the way, have you seen Miss Yumi? Yes, but she probably doesn't remember me. I never expected the parliament to be dissolved so suddenly. But with the recent rise in approval ratings, the timing is perfect. It would be great if Councilman Kawashima could recover. Such is life, you can't predict everything. He should be doing much better now, right? Of course, but it will still take some time to return to a normal life. So everyone is arguing about who should run? Is that so? Yes, everyone wants to come out on top. After all the endless arguing, they settled on a compromise, choosing the councilman's daughter. - That's right. - But... This kind of situation is quite common. Does the councilman's daughter know about all this? Oh my goodness. I wonder what she's feeling. She probably doesn't understand much. If his wife were still here, I wonder what she would say. I never thought you would be willing to stay. I thought you would definitely leave. Exactly Nakamura left so quickly. He immediately jumped to Councilman Miyata's camp. He moves really fast. Well, I've been receiving a lot of support from Councilman Kawashima since I started as a volunteer. You seem quite loyal and faithful. Actually, no one tried to poach me. Plus, my daughter is getting into a private elementary school. Do you know how expensive the tuition is? Hello, everyone. Thank you all for your hard work and efforts. It's nothing. This is Miss Yumi, right? Long time no see. Do you still remember me? Of course, I remember. Please take care of us. We believe that only Miss Yumi, as the councilman's daughter, can carry on Councilman Kawashima's legacy. Yes, you have all been supporting Councilman Kawashima for years. We truly appreciate you continuing to hold your positions. After all, even if you were to resign, it wouldn't be surprising. We hope you all continue to support Miss Yumi. Councilman Kawashima said this before as well... Sorry. I think this area could use some tidying up. It's like a garbage dump. If you're going to be a council member, the office should be cleaner. Let's work together to create a suitable working environment. Even such a small place is essential. Can you give me a little time? I am Kawashima Yumi. Let's work hard together. I'm sure all of you good companions are also anxious. Honestly, I feel the same. I wonder why I chose this challenging path voluntarily. I wonder why I chose this challenging path voluntarily. But that's how it has to be to bring about a turning point. Politics is like a life-or-death game. I understand. Though I'm not experienced, I have been exposed to it since I was young, probably because of our family ties. - I can't escape this destiny after all. - Hamaguchi, can you help? Lower the TV volume, the remote control isn't working. Where was I? Yes, that's politics. It's a world of competition and strife, where anything can happen. Let's work together to make Japan better. Let's join forces and strive to win the election. Please take care of us. Please guide us. - Did she call us "good companions"? - Yes. Is that really okay? She seems a bit overexcited. Do you all think so too? Her way of speaking seems a bit Westernized. I hope everything goes smoothly. Master Tanimura, it depends on your skills now, right? I think so too. Really? Leave it to me; I'll teach her the ins and outs of politics. - Good morning. - Good morning. I called you several times just now. I know. It's okay. I was worried something might happen. You worry too much. Let's do our best together today. Let's do our best together. - Door-to-door canvassing might be illegal.. - Be quiet. What's the matter? Hello, I'm Councilman Kawashima Shouhei's daughter. Thank you for your support all this time. My father is retiring from politics, and I will inherit his legacy. I am Kawashima Yumi, and I will do my best. We are having a campaign rally soon, and you are welcome to attend. Um... I don't have voting rights. Please take care of me in the future. I see, I understand. You said it's dangerous for the elderly to fall into the drainage ditch. I totally understand. Personally, I think it's dangerous to have a drainage ditch that could make the elderly fall. Exactly, right? Are you looking for a job? What have you been doing before this? Thank you. Please guide me in the future. I hope we can meet at the front entrance next time, not at the back. How do you feel after these few weeks? Being a secretary must be tiring, right? Actually... I find it quite relaxing. Really? My dad kept scaring me, making me think it would be tough. - Are you talking about Iwabuchi, the councilman? - Yes. He wanted me to learn seriously from Councilman Kawashima, but it's easier than I thought. - I'll be a good secretary... - Thank you. -Really? - Yes, Futata, you've heard about it too, right? Yes, it's Mr. Miyazono from Mishima Town. We didn't invite him to the last meeting, and he's been upset since then. This is bad; he's the chief secretary, after all. We did invite him; he must have forgotten. Hello, everyone. Please, take a moment to check the photos. Thank you. Thank you all for your support. Please guide us in the future. He is Mr. Hirose, a county councilman, and chairman of the education and culture committee. - Thank you for visiting. - Please guide us. He is Mr. Date , who plays grass baseball with my father. - Thank you for playing with him often. - Not at all This is Mr. Miyata from Kusama Construction. He helped come up with your name. I never thought of that. Please guide us. Please guide me in the future. Good morning, please give me your advice Mr. Tanimura, I've moved in. Thank you, just put it there. Good morning, please guide me. Are you okay? Are you okay? Good morning... Do you feel more real now? No, there's nothing like that. But I'm someone who speaks my mind, so people might think I'm arrogant. Not at all. It seems we don't have to worry about this year's election. No, we can't let our guard down yet. Really? The election is coming soon. The opposition originally wanted to unite behind a single candidate, but it seems that won't happen. Yes, let's hope it stays that way this time. Please don't turn what I said into a report. I can't promise that. Lately, they've been telling us reporters to keep a clear boundary. Is that so? By the way, how have you been recently? She's exaggerating, isn't she? Miss Kawashima is indeed enthusiastic, but it seems like she's out of touch. Good morning. Good morning to you both. Stop imitating her. Today, I thank you all for attending. I am Kawashima Yumi, currently serving as the district director for the 12th electoral district. I have decided to run for the House of Representatives election, and I hope for your guidance and support. in this day and age, we should strive for our goals. What kind of politics does Japan need now? It needs responsible politics that won't burden future generations or bring harm to Japan. I believe that's what Japan needs right now. I'm sure you all might feel uneasy. I want to emulate my father, the former defense minister. Let's regain the trust of the public and bring back strong political leadership. This steadfast attitude is crucial. Japan is facing many crises now. We must change our mindset to turn things around. That's right, it's a topic we need to think about sooner rather than later. We need to have a clear vision and avoid being swayed by emotions. Thank you, everyone. Let's go. She's still a newcomer, so please be lenient. May I ask a question? What are your views on the key issue of declining birth rates? Of course, it's an important issue that needs to be discussed. It's a problem Japan must solve as soon as possible. Getting married but not having children is purely selfish and self-serving. Have we not fulfilled our human responsibilities? Though I am single too. Thank you, everyone. We shouldn't talk like that. Yes. Lately, this issue has been particularly sensitive. I think she was just joking. What? No, the problem is not there. Really? The news is out. I think I should report to you. It's alright. Elections are about overcoming challenges one by one. I understand. Don't worry, I don't mind at all. Look, there are similar comments below. Saying that my views are correct. That's great to hear. Some people agree with me. But everyone's profile picture is a national flag. That's amazing! - Miss Kawashima. - please no photos. Please give your opinion on the recent remarks. It's all a misunderstanding. Once the truth is understood... - Are you okay? -Sorry. - Can you say a few more words? -Thank you. What are you doing? I'm sorry. You were too careless. You should have practiced beforehand. I apologize. I asked for help from Congressman Saito to ease the situation. Let's see how things go after this. I am truly grateful. What do you mean not having children is selfish? Some people want to have children but can't! Ms. Kawashima, come out quickly! Don't run away! Come out and apologize! Apologize now! Apologize! Come out! Get out! Hurry! Get out! Kawashima! Apologize formally! -She's coming! -Apologize quickly! No escaping! Looks like things are getting a bit messy. She's coming back. Thank you all for your hard work. No need to be polite. Do you feel cold? Thank you for your hard work. Are you hungry? We have some meat buns here. Eat while it's hot. It's okay. There's plenty more here. Eat as much as you can. Don't be shy. There are drinks here too. Thank you all for coming. Wait, I take back what I said earlier. Apologize quickly. This will turn into a ticket-buying situation. I think she just means well. After all, she's young and cares for the country and the people. Hope she fulfills her duties properly in the future. This settles the debt from the previous hot spring trip. Although I could speak for her this time, it might not be the case next time. Remember to control her words properly." You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. This incident has come to a temporary conclusion. See, as long as you work hard, nothing will go wrong. Indeed. Actually, I also have the merchandise on me. Have you noticed? You noticed, right? Yes, there are cameras here. - What? -Oh my gosh. How do you like it? You need this kind of tool now, don't you? It's so cool! It feels a bit fake though. And this pen also has a camera. -Where? -Right here. - The lens is so small. -This one? -Here? -Exactly. Is it for real? You can easily record videos with it. Excuse me... What are those people here for? They are construction companies with interests related to the council members. Some municipal government officials seem to be here too. Regarding future cooperation... Now that I'm acting as the representative, please guide me. Is it really okay? The Ichinose Trading's apartment project in Shirakiyama district can proceed as planned? Don't worry, the council member instructed me to continue. I've been his secretary for so many years. We've been in contact for a long time. After all, we still have past connections. Can things continue as usual after his daughter takes over? Please take care of it, council member. You are the key to our election victory. I'll handle it as usual. But I still need to find a way to make my people listen. It's not easy, you know? Of course, I understand. Thank you for your efforts, council member. I'll still try my best. I have no other choice. This is the speech script for the campaign rally. Also, please ask Councilor Ishibashi to settle the disturbance later. I'll go and greet him later and apologize. Um... Thank you. Thank you all for coming today. Although there have been some discordant voices lately, I'm perfectly fine. I've always believed that the harder the challenge, the better. I've overcome several difficulties in the past, and this time is no different. I decided to run for office because of my late father... I apologize. I hope to carry on his legacy... To fulfill his aspirations in his stead. But, honestly, I find it very painful. I don't want to run for office at all. But everyone insists that I'll definitely win, pushing me into this position. They all say my father wanted me to take over. But at the same time, they criticize and demand so much from me. I've already tried so hard... I'm sorry you had to go through such treatment. If I had known, I wouldn't have stepped forward to run either. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Everyone came here to support you. Yeah, you shouldn't act like that. here we go again. Why do you always have so many opinions? We don't have any of that. And right now, you're not shedding a single tear. -Is there a problem? -Were you just pretending to cry? I don't understand what you're saying. What's with your attitude? Miss Kawashima, the way you acted earlier was not acceptable. Wait, why does it sound like I'm the one at fault? I mean, come on... I've done everything, and you're still nagging. It's hard to believe. As the daughter of a council member, of course, you should act properly. -What? - Exactly. You should be mindful of your words. You'll cause trouble for your father. Be careful! Here we go again. Why does no one care about my feelings? Alright, let's stop here for today. I can't take it. - We're just getting started. -Nonsense. I'm truly sorry. It's really bewildering. Everyone probably wants me to lose the election. Not at all. They do. Everyone thinks I'm a fool. I was never cut out for this job. I only came out because my father wanted me to. They should be helping me instead. Making me look like a fool. I understand. Let me handle this. sorry. Please spare me. She's just a child. You're right. Thanks for your help. It's so thankless. Why do you act as if it's none of your business? We're colleagues, right? Sometimes you have to know how to appease a child in this job. - That's true. -Please help me out. Actually, we're quite busy too. Stop talking nonsense. Is that true? To bring vitality to Japan and protect people's lives, even if it's just a small step, I hope to fight alongside everyone. Sorry, is now a good time? I want to talk about your past online comments. You once boasted about going to an izakaya with an underage boy two years ago. "Suddenly realized the boy was underage when I got to the izakaya." "It's a crime, but it's super fun" this... You even wrote, "It's rare to drink with a nineteen-year-old boy." If this is true, it could be a big problem. -Excuse me... -Do you have anything to say? Wait, are you drinking now? I'm not drinking. - What do the voters think about this? - What do I think? That's why people call you a "silly heiress." And the age difference between you and the nineteen-year-old boy is too much. What kind of education did you receive? Was it influenced by your father? Did he have affairs with young women in the past? Do you have a genetic attraction to minors in the Kawashima family? This is ridiculous! Seeing your father like young girls, so you can't control yourself either? Shut up! What are you saying? Take back your words. I won't. What? You brat! You're so arrogant in your speech! Help! Help me! Stop her! Come and help! Apologize now! Apologize! Wait! Wait a minute! Be careful; I'll kill you! Kawashima Yumi declares her candidacy for the House of Representatives election, but after a recent slip of the tongue, a new controversy has emerged. Alleged remarks about drinking with a minor have sparked public anger. Be careful I'll kill you! Here we go again? Please spare us. I warned her to delete her past posts, but it seems someone troublesome found fault. What do you mean? It seems like a live streamer with a bad reputation. He deliberately provokes celebrities to earn video clicks. Earn clicks on your videos This time, he happened to get involved with this repeat offender. Sorry, I can't understand what you're saying at all. This is Miss Kawashima, and that's the live streamer. Just like this, they started arguing. Got it? Many reporters came to ask about this incident. I also received a bunch of messages from lawmakers. They're getting anxious upstairs; let's hold a press conference. Please stick to the script and don't talk too much. Answer the questions as we discussed earlier, Mr. Miyamoto. I'm truly sorry, Mr. Miyamoto. You've caused such a mess right before the election, even making it to TV. It's ridiculous. It's completely different from what you said before. I apologize; it's my fault entirely. - Are you even listening? - What? Take this seriously. Mr. Miyamoto, please calm down. We're really troubled by having such a foolish daughter involved in this. Isn't there anyone else we can choose? There must be other talents. At least pick a guy It's annoying. Can we talk about this later? You clearly didn't listen to what we said. You also don't seem to study diligently. I never asked for your help in the first place. Miss Yumi, you can't say that. How can you show such an attitude to the supporters? If you're unhappy, you can leave anytime. Miss Kawashima, What did you just say? Miss Yumi? Hey! Respond to me! That's enough. Let's go. Wait. let's go Let's leave the supporter group. Mr. Miyamoto, don't be like this. Because the young lady said she doesn't need us. Thank you for your support until now. - Wait, don't do this. - Enough. Mr. Miyamoto, please. Due to my reckless actions, this has caused such a big commotion in society. It's ridiculous; what are you doing? You even made the supporter group leave? You should've figured out a way to avoid this situation. I'm sorry. Senator Ikeda, what's happening right now? If you secretaries can't control her properly, all our efforts will go to waste. I'm truly sorry. Lately, everything's been going wrong; nothing is going well. Secretaries need to handle things properly. How can you ruin our plans like this? You need to take your job seriously! Take your work more seriously! She did apologize... Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. It's no problem. What do you want to say? I do have some things to say. Looking at the current situation, the campaign doesn't look optimistic. - Considering everything that has happened. -Yes. To break this deadlock, we need to communicate and be united in spirit. That's absolutely right. You said it well. So, I want to convey everyone's opinions to make our relationship closer. I'll point out some areas where you need to improve... That's great. This process is crucial. I used to do the same at my previous job, convene employees to discuss areas for improvement. I understand. It's a great approach. Thanks for cooperating. Please go ahead. I won't mind. Thank you. - We're all adults; let's talk calmly. - OK. - Alright then... - Mr. Towai, could you get me a cup of coffee? Sure. It's just... Other lawmakers and our secretaries feel that... Miss Kawashima seems to lack a sense of crisis. I see. If there's more trouble, it'll be difficult to win the election. Every move will affect the campaign. I hope you'll show the crisis awareness of a candidate. I understand now. I'll do my best. Also, please be more mindful of your words and actions. My words and actions? Yes, I understand you're serious about solving problems. But our way of expressing it might not be the best. Currently, your behavior doesn't seem to align with that of a candidate. It comes across as annoying and amateurish. For the sake of the upcoming election, I hope you can improve. I see. I'm sorry for the trouble. It's no problem at all. - Here's your coffee. - I prefer iced coffee. Apologies. Is that all you wanted to say? Can I add a few more things? Of course, please be honest. Thank you. Let me see... Lately, you've been frequently late. Please be more punctual. It's easy for that to affect your image. - This is the coffee. - With creamer. There are also people who say "Your drive is in the wrong place" "As an adult I wish you were more mature" There are more... "Your attitude when listening to others is too obvious." "Your laughter could be softer, your smile seems forced." It's really giving me a headache. - This is coffee. - With cream. Sorry. Some people hope you won't be too willful and think of the employees. Many say you "drink too much cola, and your manners are poor." That's true, indeed. And there's more... "Your memory is as bad as a rooster's." "You wear too much perfume, as if hiding something." What? "Your phone case is ugly; you should get a new one." That seems a bit too much. Is that so? This is with cream. I don't usually use this type of cream; change it! Okay. Don't you dare speak to me like that again. I believe in myself to overcome all kinds of obstacles. Given our current situation, it may not look good. But I still hope all of you can lend me your strength. Let's overcome this adversity together. - There are too few people, right? - It's ridiculously few. Last time, there were more staff than attendees. You should reinforce your support group. It's not my problem, right? I think everyone knows that we have internal problems. It's probably already widely known. Mr. Miyamoto's support is crucial; after all, he's the best at rallying people. We should hurry and ask Mr. Miyamoto and the others to come back. Is there any good solution? We can only have Miss Kawashima apologize. Sorry, what happened? Miss Kawashima said she won't run anymore. What? She's up there. What's going on? I protest against all of you for your terrible attitudes! Treat me with some respect! What? Listen carefully. Japan's politics are beyond saving. no one is interested in politics. Do you know why? It's because of us. The problem lies within us. This is normal" and "We've always done it this way." People don't think, and that's Japan's current state. No one pays attention to anything. Young people don't have any expectations for politics. The economy is stagnant, yet they think Japan is an economic powerhouse. We can't rely on others to change things. We need to step up and make the citizens understand. The first step is to change ourselves. Didn't I think she was suitable for politics? She's really good at reasoning. I demand that all of you improve! If you don't change, I won't run for office! You don't need to shout from the rooftop. Some people can only express their opinions this way. She must have been pampered too much before. But it wouldn't be good if she actually jumped. Though this height shouldn't be lethal. Sometimes people must have thought about jumping from here before. Why is that? Probably because the height is just right. Maybe. It's not easy for her to step into politics all of a sudden. And Tanimura went too far with his remarks earlier. Should I be blamed? Yes, it's all your fault. You need to figure out a solution. I understand. Don't come near me. What do you want to do? You'll know when you see it. True. Don't you feel ashamed of yourselves? But this is how politicians are. What? What are you talking about? So you want me to change myself? I know this goes against your will... Don't joke around. I understand. Then I'll jump. Don't stop me; I want to die. I am a political sacrifice. The bigger the scene, the better. I got it. Please jump. What? Please jump. I'll wait for you to jump. -You think I'm just saying it casually? -No, I don't. -I mean it seriously... -I know. Wait... -Come on. -Hold on. I'll choose the right moment myself. Wait! Stop! I'll jump on my own! Don't do this! Look at this. -Is she really going to jump? -I don't know. She's really spirited. They're pulling her back. That's enough now. She jumped right on target. unbelievable. Apologies, But it's impossible for you to back out now. What? If you don't run anymore, You can still go back to your father's salon as a consultant, But it's different for us secretaries. If the candidate we follow loses, we'll be unemployed. There's nothing we can do about it. and there's another reason. It's also for your father's sake. He wants you to inherit his legacy, Hoping you won't disregard his intentions. I... He wishes to pass on everything he has built so far to you. Are you willing to let everything end? We all know how deeply you love your father, And everyone's attitude towards you lacks consideration. It's your first time entering politics, We should have been more considerate. So, I apologize to you. I'm sorry. Can you continue with the election? I understand. Then let me discuss something with you first. What? The three are the president of Watanabe Construction, Former director of Owaki Television, And the former president of Takenaka Central Transportation. I'm really sorry about earlier. We were a bit out of line before. Have you reflected on your actions? Yes. It's okay, let's keep fighting. You seem to have changed a lot. Don't cause too much trouble for the nurses, okay? It's alright. How is the senator now? He can finally speak, But it will take some more time before he can move around. I see. By the way, did I mention it's 40 cm times 42 cm? Wait, this seems a bit large. Is that Mr. Nishikawa, the politician? He was originally from the Minsei Party, But since he wasn't nominated, he ran as an independent candidate. He's really struggling, taking care of his sick wife as well. He's campaigning while looking after his wife? That's really impressive. So now we have the news coverage. You really know how to promote yourself. Is this the front of the station? If it's the front, there will be more elderly people... Let's take this route to avoid the elementary school. The campaign rally will be held at Tsukuba Hall until 11 o'clock... On December 8th, at the Civic Center, there are 1200 seats. I'll bring 300 people, Mr. Tomita will bring 200 people, Mr. Takamatsu will also bring 200 people, How about 100,000 from Mr. Yoshida's side? Or make it 150,000. Let's start off energetically. Bon Voyage! I'm off! I, Yumi Kawashima, will do my best! About tomorrow's schedule... You've worked hard. Thank you. I told you it's not possible. We have a fixed budget for meals, Receipts for tax purposes and others need to be separate. Don't make me say it so many times, let me rest. I'm so tired. Are you tired? Not at all. -Really? -Yes. Thank you for all your efforts during this period. Please don't say that. You've worked so hard, I hope you'll be successful in the election. Yes. Excuse me, can I borrow some time? - Sure, you've confirmed it, right? - right? I wonder how the election will turn out? Don't you know? You're almost certain to win. is that so? I've already confirmed the poll results with reporter Hirama. It seems like the outcome was confirmed yesterday. is that so? That's great. So, what are these preparations for? We still need to do what needs to be done. Right. - Tanimura - what's the matter? Have you seen the gossip magazine? What? It's in the celebrity gossip magazine. Is there any problem with the rest of the schedule? I've rearranged it, but it's best to wrap things up as soon as possible. Wait, what happened? It's finally been exposed. This is even bigger than Miss Yumi's incident last time. That's not what I wanted to ask. We were joking about how fortunes can change. Hamaguchi, have you contacted a lawyer? Not yet. Why is this coming up now after so many years? Maybe it's a leak from another camp, like Mr. Nishikawa's side. It must be him. He's quite cunning. Wait a minute. Does everyone know about this? You don't know either? What? Really? Yes some of us had suspicions. After all, we are secretaries. I had no idea. No way. I thought you already knew. The one who made the mistake was your father, you don't have to worry. The problem is not there. Since it's out now, let's resolve it quickly. They definitely timed this well. They're using this tactic right at the beginning of the election. They're clever. Why didn't any of you tell me? What do we do now? Usually, the congressman holds a press conference, But now, Congressman Kawashima is not in a position to do so. Then let Miss Kawashima hold a press conference. Me? Why? Do I need to apologize? No, actually, if you insist on denying it, that would have been enough. But now that the campaign has started, say you were unaware, And let the secretary admit to it, and put an end to the matter. - What? - Make the secretary take the blame? That's an old trick. Considering the election, it's the least damaging solution. Usually, they keep denying until the issue dies down. Lately, this kind of thing is quite common and not a big deal. Is it true or not? This is our current investigation result. I guess that's the only way to handle it. Who will take the blame then? Um... It's me. Mr. Mukai? Wait a minute. Congressman Kawashima is like my foster parents. Of course, I'll step up. I'm prepared, don't worry. Thanks. So, this is how it feels. What about the speech for the press conference? - About that... - Give me a moment. Isn't it strange? Playing this kind of survival trick? Isn't that dishonest? We're deceiving people. What if we get exposed? About that... Then, the speech for the press conference... What? I'll handle it, is that okay? - That's right. - Got it. Then, let's prepare for the press conference later. - Listen to me... - Miss Kawashima, I understand what you mean. I'll think about it again. In ten minutes, let's discuss the preparation for the press conference. Alright. Is this really okay? Yes. Isn't this just lying? Of course, I know. but considering priorities, this is the only way. It's so cold today. Thanks to everyone for making the trip. Regarding the media reports, I'm not clear on the details myself. I'll find a way to uncover the truth. What's going on? Why aren't you saying anything? You pushed me into the election and kept everything from me. I feel so embarrassed. Say something. You're capable of committing such a foolish scandal? Hello? Is something wrong? Is it true? But I'll be busy until late tonight. I'll contact my mom. Mom? Maiko has a fever. Can you help pick her up from school? What? Congressman Kawashima? They're here. come quickly. - How's his condition? - I don't know the details yet. After all, the congressman is getting old. But he looks perfectly healthy. No, it's almost like he's passed away peacefully. The congressman hasn't passed away yet. But if he does pass away, what should we do? that is to say Meaning, before it was because of Congressman Kawashima... ...that we received kickbacks from the corporations. But if Congressman Kawashima actually passes away... ...we'd have to adjust the kickback ratio. That's true, but it's rushing things a bit. It's not as simple as just changing the account. Why did we even put that woman forward? It's all for these matters. I understand that, of course. But the media's very sensitive lately. We should be cautious. You just don't want your share of the money to decrease. We're grateful to Congressman Kawashima for his service to the people. But we're the ones who establish connections with the corporations. You can't take everything for yourself. In other places, it's not done like this. - But... -It's not just that. You're also taking advantage of Congressman Kawashima's name. Is it necessary to bring this up now? You're the only one reaping all the benefits. Where in the world does such a good fortune exist? - The situation is different now. - Naturally. Just wait a moment. Bring some tea! What are they doing now? They're busy fighting amongst themselves. Oh my... How did it end up like this? You want that foolish daughter to take over? She's not capable at all. That's... We presented her as a puppet for this purpose. People from Tomaya Construction are worried and came to discuss with me. Why did they go to you? You suddenly increased the donation amount and approached several companies. It's not good. Congressman Kawashima probably doesn't know. They've had a longstanding relationship with him. That's why they intentionally kept the amount low before. You can't give them special treatment every time. But you chose this timing. Of course, people will be suspicious. You're probably trying to profit more from this opportunity, aren't you? -Don't you have any shame? -Calm down. What kind of tone is that! I have connections to manage too! Blame yourself for being too reckless in the past! Miss Kawashima... -Regarding Tomaya Construction... -I already know... Enough Enough of you all! What's going on now? It's embarrassing. It's like my father has already passed away. What do you all take my father for? I won't tolerate any more of your antics. Do you understand? I won't allow any more slander about our father, understand? No one is allowed! I will never forgive! Shut up! You jerk! What's happening here has nothing to do with you. Don't butt in without reason. Do you understand your position? Who gave you the chance to run for election? It was us! Who would send a political novice woman to run? We were looking for an obedient puppet! But my father... Do you really think that's what your father intended? Tanimura, please explain. Alright. what happened? - Well... -Explain clearly. When discussing the candidate selection, it was a heated argument. Because we couldn't decide, we compromised by having you run. You pushed me into the election to have an obedient puppet, right? To put it bluntly, yes. So this wasn't my father's intention at all? Right... Tanimura, were you aware of all this? I had an indirect idea. What's going on? So no matter how hard I try, it's all in vain? No, that's definitely not the case. This is the most appropriate choice. - What? - You may be shocked. But this kind of practice is common in politics. We truly hope you get elected. To achieve our goal, this is the best method. - Tanimura - What is it? What do you think I'll feel after learning the truth? We also reported to our father afterwards. We obtained his permission too. - I won't run. -Sorry, it's too late. What? We've made various preparations. To convince the party to let you run We've spent a lot of money to make things work. All for that precious seat. We won't give up midway. and... I also know... You're not the type to abandon everything. Though this might not sound pleasant to you. Right now, you can only choose to continue running. Let me repeat it again. This is your best choice. You might find it difficult to understand. But there are ways to enter politics like this. And you will definitely become a great politician. I'm not just saying this; everyone thinks so. At first, you might find it difficult to accept. But in the end, you'll surely understand. I hope you can take on this task. I can't do it! It seems like Congressman Kawashima has pulled through. His approval ratings don't seem to have significantly dropped. It seems you can be at ease now. That's a relief then. What’s wrong with you? Nothing, there's nothing at all. You must be annoyed. Not really. I can't keep hiding these truths. Reporter Hirama, this is my experience in this election. I see, so all these things happened. I can't accept it and I think it should be made public. That's why I choose to tell you. please, for the sake of change, write a report about it. Alright, I'll get things arranged and then contact you. She said so herself. I understand. Sorry for troubling you. I won't let this matter be exposed. Thank you. Leave the rest to us. You've been working really hard. -You've waited long. -Not at all. But there's something I need to report to you first. What's the matter? I've already heard from Reporter Hirama. I'm sorry. That kind of approach wasn't right. I hope you won't do something like that again. - Tanimura. - what's the matter? I still can't accept being used like this. I understand. So I've decided, it's okay as long as I lose. What? I didn't say anything wrong, did I? How? Can this be done? This doesn't seem quite right. Please, I'm begging you to help me. I'm sorry, but I can't accompany you. In that case, I'll go to other reporters with the information. - What? - It doesn't matter who i tell. There must be someone interested in this kind of thing. I'm going to tell the whole story from beginning to end. Reporters love this kind of thing, don't they? This is the only option I have left. Actually, it's not that uncommon. I doubt any reporters would be interested. And I advise you not to do this. Why? Although it's difficult to talk about. But if the media actually reports it. We can't admit it, nor can we deny it. Next is the public statement. The campaign team can't understand your actions. And they mention your mental state isn't always good. Might engage in unsettling abnormal behavior. Added a lot of trouble for the campaign team. What? That's all nonsense. It's true that it's all nonsense. But many people witnessed your strange behavior at the beginning. Some might have even recorded it. We'll continue leaking unfavorable information about you. I'm not talking about election-related matters. For example, your involvement with a male PR person nine years ago, affecting your mental and physical well-being. It doesn't matter if it's true; the point is to tarnish your image. We'll use any means necessary. So compared to the election results. It will affect your future social credit. I'm sorry, but it's very likely to end up like this in the end. so... I'm sorry, please give up the struggle. Alright, let's go. We have a lot of tasks to run today as well. I couldn't even dare to look at her while she was speaking. I really don't want to stay on the scene. You've worked hard. No, I'm fine. The next-generation politicians who take over often act like this. she'll get used to it someday. That's true. I'm so tired. I'll go check the office over there. - Iwabuchi. - What's the matter? Speaking of after the election... What's wrong? After she gets elected, will you still be willing to continue? Sure, I don't have a problem. Really? Why are you asking like that? Because there have been some internal issues lately. Seeing those scenes, I thought you might leave. No, that's not the case. Is that so? I think since politics is like this nowadays... Then we should understand and accept it, right? Is that so? Yes. Well, I'm going now. Take care on the way. Okay. The salmon bento is really delicious. Let's order more. The staff also like it a lot. The portion size is just right. I can have a hamburger steak too. The delivery from that place is always slow. That won't do. It's because they're afraid the food will get cold. When delivering bentos, being on time is crucial. Miss Kawashima? Is something wrong? Miss Kawashima? Are you okay? I'm sorry. Where were we? We were talking about the bento. These incidents have occurred. I understand. Thank you. I'll excuse myself now. I'm sorry for causing you trouble. No worries, I'm fine. Come here. You once said that if she got into a private elementary school, I would listen to one wish from you. Do you still remember? I remember. Right. It seems that promise hasn't been fulfilled yet. I want to ask you something. What is it? If Maiko says she doesn't want to go to the private elementary school she's currently attending, what would you do? considering her future, I'd naturally think it's better for her to continue her education. True. But... we've been doing all this for her sake, but in the end, I just want her to follow her own path. I thought about all these things while I was in the hospital. For me, as long as my daughter is happy, that's my greatest joy. So... I think it's okay if Maiko doesn't go to school. Assuming she doesn't want to, of course. If there really comes a day like that, you would respect your daughter's decision, right? Hey! You, the lousy secretary! I told you to include Congressman Okawa in the schedule for the next speech, but you didn't add it at all! I'm sorry. You, seriously... -Please do your job properly. -I apologize. Pull yourself together! Idiot. I'm very sorry. This coffee is just awful. What is this? Did the coffee machine break? It seems to be clogged. It's disgusting. Can't be saved. Mr. Tanimura, the coffee tastes really strange, doesn't it? Is it really that strange? Has the coffee machine been used for a long time? We used this machine during the election. I did think about fixing it. This is ridiculous, it's like sewage. It's amazing how you guys can keep going. Exactly. It's gone to such an extent. It's impressive that we can stay calm. We're not achieving anything. Wouldn't it be better to resolve it? Exactly. but why? Because I don't want to drink bad coffee anymore. In any case, losing the election is easy. All you have to do is be yourself and lower your approval rating. I've already set up a fake website. I've never used drugs. Alright, get ready. This is infuriating! I must win! Why are you brewing tea? I want coffee! I told you before! Bring the coffee quickly! Why is it iced coffee? What is this? Strange cheat sheets are appearing online. What is this? So low-quality, just writing random things. I'm furious! I must choose! What kind of black tea are you making! I want coffee! This is my voice? The more Chinese and Korean people, the more crime there is. They're taking away jobs from Japanese people too. To maintain Japan's security, these foreigners must be expelled first. Japan is a great nation. Now it's becoming more and more... Over here. Hey Hey hey! Stop talking nonsense! All you do is oppose, but you can't present any policies! Who would believe what you're saying! Stop making empty promises! I object! what are you doing? Is it not allowed? I'm just expressing my thoughts. Do you want to fight? That would violate election laws. Sorry, someone committed a crime... You actually bumped into me! Quick, someone come! Call the police for me! It hurts so much! Hurry up and get someone! How's it going? The disturbance went smoothly. People love watching and criticizing. It's a hot topic in online news too. Tanimura. What's up? What's going on with her? Negative news is everywhere. You need to keep a close eye on her. I'm sorry, I already reminded her. What are you doing? You caused so much trouble. -What are you thinking? -I'm really sorry. -Is it not allowed? I have my own considerations. -What? Every word I said was right, right? Reporter Hirama said he sent over some poll results. Let me check... Don't you feel embarrassed? It's meaningful to speak up. Did I really cause a big scene? You did make quite a stir online. But the approval rating hasn't changed much. It actually made your loyal supporters like you even more. Regarding the previous scandal involving your father, I have an idea. Can we use that ugly incident? Yes, but... Once this information leaks... I don't mind. Go ahead and do it. I understand. But what exactly is your idea? Hello? Thank you for getting in touch with me. What would you like for lunch today? I didn't see it. didn't see anything at all. So, what's the outcome? Miss Kawashima! What are your thoughts on the bribery suspicions involving your father? We can see someone who appears to be Congressman Kawashima accepting cash. The person bribing the congressman. It's the same person who was previously reported by the media. Representative of a precision instrument manufacturing company. About Representative Kawashima... I'm truly sorry. I will call back again. Darn it! Hamaguchi! This time it's really bad. There's even a video. Can you recognize who leaked it? Who's the whistleblower? I guess it must be someone from within our organization. - How could that be? - It's absolutely right. People from other camps must have infiltrated. This is bad, what should we do now? I can't believe I didn't notice. Miss Tanaka, do you have any idea? What? no, i don't know. I think the same goes for me. Mr. Hamaguchi, it looks l ike we need to hold a press conference. Yes. Miss Kawashima must be quite troubled by this. Exactly. To think that such an unnecessary topic has come up. Temperatures over the weekend are expected to drop rapidly... We interrupt this program with a breaking news update. North Korea submits a report to international organizations. They are planning to launch an artificial satellite between the 15th and 25th of the month. What? Essentially, this is a warning of an imminent long-range ballistic missile launch. The first missile will be directed towards the Yellow Sea off South Korea. Then the satellite's fairing... What's going on here? Launching missiles is quite a mess. This doesn't look good. But this works out perfectly. What do you mean? This major news will instantly overshadow the scandal. So, you're saying... Exactly, we got incredibly lucky! You really are blessed by luck. Indeed, it's quite fortunate. very good! very good! If it's launched towards Japan, It would reach here in about seven to eight minutes. Faced with ballistic missiles, the Maritime Self-Defense Force's fleet... Now nobody will even care about the scandal. Why did they choose to launch the missiles now of all times? We have to come up with a solution. I understand. Looks like we'll have to go with the flow. I've heard about it too. It's quite the coincidence. This is really great, the timing couldn't be better. This is fantastic! Great! Hooray! I'll release this video anonymously first. As long as someone sees it, it'll definitely cause a commotion. I am Yumi Kawashima. I humbly ask for your support. Please take care of me. Mr. Tanimura, It seems they won't be launching the missiles after all. Really? During the preparations for the ballistic missiles, Some issues were mentioned... Darn it! They're not launching them? What a shame, darn it! We can only stick to the original plan and hold the press conference. Yeah, I thought we could get through this this time. Hello? Is it true? It seems that Congressman Nishikawa is withdrawing from the race. what happened? He's busy taking care of his sick wife, And he ended up falling ill himself. It's difficult for him to continue running, so he decided to withdraw. Is it the same as what was reported last time? Great! That's wonderful! I've never heard of something like this before. I've heard that he was having a tough time. I've been waiting for this moment for so long! He really deserves it! Well, he shouldn't have tried to take care of his wife at the same time. How foolish. Nishikawa's votes should come to us now. We still have a chance to turn things around. Exactly. Excuse me. It seems our video has appeared on the internet. On the same day the missile launch was canceled... Look at this. A video clip has ignited an internet discussion. Seeing the news of the missile launch cancellation, The candidates and their campaign teams are as happy as children, As if they've won the election ahead of time. The person joyous about the missile launch cancellation. Yumi Kawashima, a candidate in the House of Representatives election. Her happy expression has sparked a buzz online. Hey, hey, hey, what's this? Who shot this? No way. Hey, is this a good thing? Yeah, it's unbelievable. It's become an internet sensation. It's a good thing, essentially. Truly, things have turned in our favor. Excellent! Great! Miss Yumi! Sorry, excuse me. Could you please move aside? Excuse me. I'm her secretary, just passing through. In reality, our goal is to lose! She's utterly indecisive, can only follow others' lead, Nothing more than a puppet! We can't let someone like her get elected! You can't just trust her blindly! This is a meaningless election! Everyone wake up! We can't let her win! I am her secretary! trust me! It's alright. I'll be completely honest about everything. This can definitely turn things around. Regarding the lobbying case involving Congressman Masahira Kawashima, You previously stated that it was done by your secretary. What are your thoughts on it now? Um, well... My mind still hasn't changed. Information about my father has been destroyed Since we couldn't confirm anything, I believe he's not involved. In the video segment, is that indeed Congressman Kawashima? The video itself is not very clear, Since we don't know its source, we can't conclude it's him. Regarding the joyful video, Is it indeed you and your campaign team? Um... No way. It's hopeless now. What's wrong? The company related to the lobbying case admitted it. Really? The representative of the company has confessed that your father took bribes. What? The missiles used by the Self-Defense Force yesterday, Are very likely from that company. I must tell everyone the truth. Thank you all for your hard work. The voting for the House of Representatives election ends here. Vote counting for the House of Representatives election continues. The Democratic Party's small electoral districts during the counting... - You've worked hard. - You too. After all, the voter turnout is still quite low. As long as the swing voters don't come out to vote, It's a stronghold for the ironclad voters. Combined with the missile news stimulating the right wing, It seems particularly advantageous for us. So you're saying, the whistleblower in the video is you, right? What? I just guessed it that way. Is it really you? How could it be? Well, yeah. This is really great. Tanimura, about that matter... What matter? I mean... Can you pretend I don't know anything about it? Got it. - Sorry. - No worries. congratulations! The government has stated that they will continue to raise alert levels And monitor the situation closely. Next, news about a new type of pneumonia in China. According to the Chinese National Health Commission, Cases of the new pneumonia have emerged in China... This is reality. What's the use? All our efforts were in vain. Even if scandals are exposed, She can still get elected. So, I'll just become a puppet for the local assembly? This is definitely not the outcome I wanted. We did our best. It's utterly frustrating. I know that too. I'm fully aware. We did so much, yet it had no impact on the election. It must be really disappointing. Tanimura, So, you're going to continue? Continue what? To be a politician. I don't want to. Don't say this isn't the world you wanted. You're not a child anymore; you have to find a way to fight back. This is the only card we have. Let's go meet those local assembly members. Will that really change anything? In the end, it might all be in vain. I can't take it anymore. Is there really a way? I don't even know myself. I have no guarantees. i'm scared too. I never imagined it would come to this. I've had enough. - Miss Kawashima - I don't think it'll change anything. Miss Kawashima, you need to learn to envision it. I can't do it. But you still have to try. That sounds nice and all. Can we really do it? It's not a matter of whether we can or not. This is what we have to do. It's truly unexpected. So, I'm determined. What about you? Let's just do it.
