- Let's climb. - This game will kill us, Francis. - You hear the electric buzz louder the higher you get. Your teeth will shiver. But if you make it to the top... Bro, you're good. It's a great view, you know? Footstep on the wrong line... Touch your hand on the wrong metal while you're brushing against another... ...you'll burn to a crisp. You want to go out like that? Then when you climb, go careful. You watch me. Follow my every move. Think on every step before you take it. Put it to memory, remember that the whole way up. And if you can't use your memory right... You lose. - Well, you're not dressed for the weather. - No, that's cool. Just a short way. You look good, Aisha. Watch your step. Won't be sleeping in the same bed, of course. I'll be using the living room couch. Uh... I got you extra towels and sheets and stuff. - Um, your mom doesn't speak anymore? - No, she speaks. She's quiet, sometimes. Especially at night. - Uh... I'm... I'm so sorry. I really shouldn't have come here. This is... This is an intrusion. I still think of Francis. - Francis, Michael, get in here, I'm leaving! I'll set out your dinner. Callaloo rice and stewed chicken. Francis, help your brother with his homework. No answering the door. No turning on the oven or the stovetop at any time, you hear me, Francis? Strap your backside red if I come back and find you or your brother hurt. Absolutely no TV after eight. I'll call at nine to say good night. I'm back at 6AM. I have to go. They're paying me time and a half. - Come on. - Okay, love you. - Hm-hmm. - Love you. - Alright. - What's up, Francis? - Just drops slightly in the way. And the reason is to make you feel as though something isn't right, something's off. - Spaz! Michael, come here. Come here. Who do you listen to? Yo, what the fuck is this shit, man? - Give me-- - Yo, the man's listening to some white boy shit, bro. - Yo! The fuck. - Respect, Francis. - No bro, don't touch him again, you hear me? - Yeah, man. It's cool. - Psst. I'll see you at home. - Alright. - Come on, Aisha. - That's my gift to you. Hey, take your time. - Thanks, man. - You're welcome. Hey, don't make anybody disrespect you. Okay? And don't make any enemies. - Your friends are assholes. - Yeah, okay. You don't get it. You know I'm thinking about quitting school? Guidance counsellors just stream us all in the shop class anyhow. I ain't gonna be no carpenter. - But you graduate in three months. You know Mom would kill you. What would you do? - I don't know. Maybe get into music, you know? Anyway, I'm just thinking about it. - Hey, can... May I sit here? Yeah. Hey in there. - Hey, uh, sorry, just... This book is really cool. - Yeah. Oedipus Rex is my favourite. Oedipus killed his father and then screwed his mother. Where are you from? What? - Where are your people from? My dad is from Jamaica and my mom was Portuguese. - My mom is Jamaican and I don't know what my dad is. - Why don't you know? - My mom doesn't really talk about him that much. - Oh. - Uh, where is... Was your mom? - She died when I was a baby. My dad raised me. She came here as a nanny and he was a gardener. They worked for the same family in Rosedale. I'm a child of the help. I know your brother, Francis. Everyone knows him. - Yeah. - All the girls in the neighbourhood, they talk about him all the time. - Hm-hmm. - I'm Aisha. - I know. Michael. My name's Michael. - Hello, Michael. - Hi, Aisha. - I didn't do anything! - Where you running to, man? Huh? You bitch ass motherfucker! - What you looking at? - Get him! - There! Fuck yeah! - Give me that. - Oh, yeah! - Stay out of my fucking neighbourhood, you heard? Bitch ass nigga! - That's what you get! - What's up, Michael? - Yo. Yo, yo. You alright? Another robbery in Scarborough today... - When's Ma coming back home again? - In the morning. Stop being such a baby. Scarborough police are presently searching for two Black men they believe to be armed and dangerous following a convenient store robbery that left one man dead. Just as a warning, what you are about to see may be disturbing to some of our viewers. If you have any information on either of these men, please call the police hotline. - Meanwhile, in Newmarket, police are still looking for any information... - Boys! Francis. - Michael was scared, Mommy. - Well I'm here now, sorry for taking so long. - I made it sweet this time, Mama. - Thank you, Francis. Thank you, Francis. - Yeah. Here's your towel. You want me to make you some tea, Mom? - No, no, thank you baby. It's too warm for English tea. - Okay. - Where are you going? I'm making dinner for you and your brother. - Just going to meet some friends. - Which "friends"? I don't want you running the street with no hooligans, you hear me, Francis? - My brethren ain't no hooligans, Mom. - Where you learn to talk like that? - "Ain't no hooligans." Not in this house. I taught you to speak the Queen's English better than that. - Alright, I'll come home for dinner. - Take your brother with you. - Why? I'm not taking him. - I don't need to go out, Mom. - We're chasing him and chasing him. You know, we put some fluid on him and the next thing you know, we just out of there. You know why? Cause we had to make an example out of him, you know? At the end of the day, we weren't gonna lit that nigga up! Oh, Francis. What's up? - Hot gal walking! Hm-hmm! - Hey! What's up? You know Joe? - Bless. I see you, I see you! - Bro? - Alright, moving on to Francis's spice rack. You know what's the difference here, Francis? - No. - Your shelves are crooked. What? They look straight to me. - Did you use a level before you put them on? - Yeah. - You're not gonna last long on the job when you get out into the real world if you don't double and triple check your work! Do better, Francis, come on. - Fuck you, fuck this. I quit. - What did you say? - Fuck you, fuck this. - Wow. - My mom's working till seven. And my brother doesn't get home for another little while. - Are these yours? - No, those are my brother's. He wants to be a producer like Dre. He's not having the best of luck yet. - Well, he has very eclectic taste. I see LL Cool J, Nina Simone, Talking Heads... Anne Murray? - Yeah, he got that from our mom's. Yeah, she thinks Anne Murray is dope. - Come sit with me. - Okay. - You alright, Goose? - Hey, Francis. - I got it. Alright, so... Alright, there you go. Give me a high-five. - What are you... What are you doing home? - I live here, remember? - Oh, this is Aisha. - Yeah, I know Aisha. What's up? - Chilling. - Yeah, we did... grade 9 English together. Smartest girl in the school. - I don't know about that. - Well... - Um, I really like your taste in music. - Thank you. I see you feeling... Eric B. and Rakim. - Yes. Rakim is the best lyricist ever. - That's right. - I hold the microphone like a grudge... ...B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge. I ain't no joke! I like you. You know your shit. For real. - Uh... I should get going. I will see you later? - Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow. Library. - Okay. See you. - Alright. Yo, is... Is Mom home yet? - No, she won't be home till seven. - Alright. - You know those guys? - Nah, not from around here. Maybe Flemingdon. Probably looking for somebody. I'm going away. - What? When? - Soon. Couple weeks, just working on the details. - But what about Mom? - I'll tell her soon. She'll be alright. She'll understand. Bro. - But-- - She'll be fine. One less mouth to feed, you know? - She relies on you. - Come on, Michael. I'm not gonna abandon her. I'll send her money. And... she's strong, you know? She survived things we don't even know about. We both take care of her. I have to go. Come on, let's go. - Shut the fuck up, man! - Fuck you! - Back up, back up. - What you waiting for? - I told you, stay the fuck out of my neighbourhood. Don't fucking misinterpret... - Yeah, run! My block! - Francis! Francis, Francis! No, let's go! - I'm making you breakfast. - No, it's alright, Mom. You don't have to. Got to go to work soon. - Oh... - It's okay. It's okay. Hey, come, sit down. I'll make you breakfast. - I can't sit, I'll set the table. - Okay. I'll be right back. Aisha? - That girl. In your bed. - She's just a friend, Mom. Aisha. She was a neighbour, remember? She used to live at Unity with her father. She was smart in school. - Yes. The scholarship girl. What's she doing now? - Not too sure. - Her jeans are very tight. - Not that tight, Mama. Look. Her father, he died not too long ago. - Oh. - I invited her to spend some time here. - In your bed. - She's here for the neighbourhood. To see and remember. - So... How long is she going to be here? - I don't know, Mom. She's just here to grieve. - Poor thing. F-R-A-N-C-I-S. Francis. F-R-A-N... C-I-S. Please, help me reach him. His birthday is at midnight. - Ma'am, I need to know which city you want. - Mom. - Hello? Are you there? Who are you trying to reach? - I understand. I know he's not... - I'll see you soon, okay? - Sleep now, okay? Come back! Where are you going? - Michael is afraid. - Come here. What's he afraid of? - I don't know. Maybe it's the Black murderers. - The who? - The Black men in the TV. - The criminals, Francis. The criminals will be caught by the police and punished. They'll not be here, we're very safe. - He doesn't believe we're very safe. - We are safe, son. - No, we're not safe. - We are safe, Francis. Come here. How about tomorrow, we go for a picnic in the Rouge Valley? - Aisha? - On the fucking ground, now! - Michael, put your hands behind your head! Look at me! Put your hands behind your head! - Your fucking hands! - Fucking do it. - Francis-- - Shut up! - Francis... - I just told you to shut the fuck up. - Let's go. - That's my mom. - Alright. - Are you their mother? - Hm-hmm. - Your boys were witness to a shooting altercation. They're not under investigation. - Was anyone hurt, officer? - A young man was killed and a little girl was hit when a bullet went through the walls of her unit while she was sleeping. - A girl? A sleeping child? - Yeah. - Is she dead? - It's under investigation. Good night. - You will tell me everything. Did you hear what I said? You will tell me everything! Francis! Did you know any of those people that were shot? You hear me asking you a question? What are you doing? Where are you going? - Nowhere. - I ask you a question! Where are you going? - Nowhere. - You're going to tell me where you're going! - Let go! - Tell me where you're going! - Francis! - Sorry. Michael. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. - Yes, can I help you? - Is Aisha home? - What do you want with my daughter? - It's okay. - Where are you going with this boy? - I'll be back soon, okay? - Really? Three? - The cops haven't caught the guys yet. Still out there. - You know where Francis went? - He's probably at Desirea's. - You should go visit him. - I haven't been there in... He hasn't invited me, so... - It was Goose. The little girl who got shot. - Little Goose? The one who rides around in the park on a blue bike? - Yeah. They're saying she's stable now. They're calling her lucky. I have to go. - Your father was so proud of you. Tell every West Indian in the world about his daughter's writing scholarship. - Aisha's a computer programmer now, Mom. - Well, I'm a vagabond programmer. In the last three months I have worked in Manilla, Austin, Kampala... - Kampala? - Yeah. That's where I was when Dad called. - Hmm. I'm so sorry, dear. - When Dad passed, I called Michael and he said, "Please visit, come home to the Park." So I did. You know, a year ago, I visited the village where my dad was born. And that's the same village where you were born. - Yeah, I saw the cane fields, now wild and a statue of Nanny of the Maroons. Yeah! You remember it. Right, Ruth? - Hmm... - I've been thinking a lot about that place since Dad died. - Tell me more about Kampala. - Who's that? - Our dad, I think. - Where is he? - I don't know. Somewhere. Mama said he was studying to be a man, but the bitch dropped out. - What were you two laughing about? - Oh, just our secret. Hey, um... So, I've been wondering. Can I plan a get-together? You know, just a gathering, really, with food and music and maybe a few words spoken about the people we've lost. - Yeah, I don't... I don't know. My mother doesn't want a whole bunch of strangers in our living room. - Strangers? It wouldn't be a bunch of strangers, Michael. Just people trying to make sense of things. - Just let them make sense of things somewhere else. Alright? I'm sorry. Won't work. - Well, you know, this would be good for your mother. And it would be good for you too. - We're fine. Don't tell me what's good for us, Aisha. - You know your mom is not well, right? - She's good. - Earlier, when you were at work, I watched her cross the avenue without even looking. I had to shout for her to turn and wait. - She's getting old. - No. It has nothing to do with age. Michael, you know that. It's been 10 years. She still can't accept it. She's stuck. - She's been doing fine lately. I don't want to complicate things for her. No gathering. Hey, Goose. - Your mother. I saw her going down into the valley. She's not wearing shoes. - Mom. Hey, come. Come on, put on some shoes. You okay? Temperatures are rising again in Southern Ontario, with highs in the next few days reaching up to 35 degrees. As the hot, humid conditions continue... - Feeling alright on this Saturday afternoon, hope you feel alright across the nation. Today, we have a very special show, because we are going to deliver. Right about now, we're going to call upon the man, DJ Dwayne, baby... - Is this it? - Is this what? - Is this all you plan on eating today? - I'm not that hungry. - What is that? - It's tinfoil. - I can see that it's tinfoil, what's it doing there? - Uh... Well, I just put it up to reflect the sun. - Is that what I look like to you? Uh, like the kind of human who put tinfoil up on our window? Like the kind of human who advertises tinfoil?! To everybody passing on the street. - Well, it's not a bad idea. I mean, other people do it. - Oh! And I'm other people? Yet, you sit over there and you look at your mother. Your own mother and think there she is, my mother, other people! You understand the sacrifice I made for you two? Eh? You hurt yourself? - It's okay. - You're touching your face. - It's just mango juice. - You smell that? The dill. - You want to get Francis? Isn't that his brother? - Yeah? Yo! Francis! Yo. - Mom made you anything today? You eat anything today? - Yeah, I... I ate a little something. - I'm gonna get you some groceries. You got the key? - Yeah. - Alright. I'll see you. Let's go. - Whose car is this? - Mine. Legit. - What, you bought it? - Yeah, of course I bought it. How else would I get it? - Are you hungry? - Yeah. - What do you feel like? - I don't know, whatever. - Alright, I'll buy you dinner. - Alright. - You know, you gotta work on things, man. - Work on? What do you mean? - Like, all sorts of things, bro. Like? - Okay, like... Stepping into Desirea's the way you did. You know? Like, always looking so fucking unsure. You gotta... be cooler about things, man, and not put everything out on your face all the time. You gotta carry yourself better, think about your look, don't matter how poor you are, you can always... turn up the edge of a collar and style a bit, you know? Little things like that. There's always a way to show the world you're not a nobody. A nigga. You never know when your break is coming. Okay? Okay? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. - And I'll take you to see Dad. - But we don't know our Dad. - We don't have to know him, he's our father. - But we don't know anything about him. Even where he lives. - I found out he's here in Scarborough. - How? - I've been asking people. - For how long? You weren't gonna tell me? - Okay, I'm telling you now. - Where in Scarborough? - In a low-rise called the Oberlin. It's like North of the highway. - It's too far. - We've got wheels now. - No, we can't just show up, Francis. Okay? It's been too long. - You see? That's exactly what I'm talking about. Not trying stuff. Not believing. I'm not saying he's gonna solve everything for us. I'm not stupid. I'm just saying we have a talk, you know? Why not give it a shot? - I don't know, Francis. - Tssk. Come on, let's go. Would you relax? You're freaking me out. This is it, 195. - Let's go, Francis. - You're not curious? What's up? Hello? - Sorry. Yeah? Who is this? - Sorry, wrong number. - You kids get out of here, you hear me? - Yeah, sorry. You bitches lost? What? - Hello? - I don't want none, whatever you're selling. - No, I'm not selling anything. It's just me. It's me. It's us. Francis and Michael. - You've got the wrong place. - Hey. - Hey. My dad's working security tonight, overnight. Come in. - Alright. - Do you think he was your dad? - No. I don't know. And I don't care. - You should ask your mom about your dad. Maybe she knows where he is. - I can't upset her. Not now. - Yo. You good? - Yeah, I'm good. - You don't seem good. - Hey. - What is he doing here? - I didn't think he'd actually show up. I sent a message to a friend and... It wasn't even a real invitation, it was just more of a suggestion that we all meet up. - Momma don't need this right now. - I know, he just... He just showed up while you were out and... Your mom let him in. They've been talking. - This is not a good idea, Aisha. I don't want my mom disturbed and confused, she's fragile. - I know. It's only going to be temporary. You know, your mom is the one who suggested the mattress, and... You know, there's room. And he doesn't really have anywhere else to go. - Yo. - Um... What's up? - What's up? - You good, Michael? - Is that bodi? - Uh no, just string beans, I couldn't find the bodi. - We're gonna be ready to eat in a few minutes. -That right, Jelly? - Yep. Maybe we should open the door a bit? It must be the scotch burning... - No. It's okay. I've got to leave soon anyways. - Uh... - Yo, hold up, hold up. Hey, you recognize these guys? - We should leave. - Fuck that. Nobody enters my shelter. - What's up, bitch? Bitch? Hey? Hey, just... What a little bitch. - What's up? - What's up? What's up? This motherfucking sodomite tells me. - Hey, fuck off. - What did you say to him? - What? You like that? - Hey. Look, I'm sorry. Alright? Just... Just relax. Just relax. - Yo. What the fuck? You... What the fuck? Fucking crazy. - Yo. Francis? Francis! - Michael. Hey, I can explain, okay? It's... it's fine. Michael. Michael! - Hey! - I'm so sorry. Michael, please! Okay, Michael please, just let me explain. - Michael, hey. Michael? Michael! We were listening to music, we were talking! - I warned you about strangers. - These are just my friends, Michael. They know the story and just want to pay their respect. - I don't want their fucking respect. I want them out of my fucking house. - Michael, stop it! - I want everybody out! Get out! Now! Get out of my house! Get the fuck out! - What's wrong with you? - Come on! - I'll take care of this. - I'm sorry, thank you so much for coming. - Do you know this place? The statue of this woman. - No. - This is Nanny of the Maroons. I didn't know anything about her until I went to Jamaica. She led a guerilla war against her colonial masters. A fierce woman. An outlaw. My dad lived just a short walk from that statue but he never told me anything about her. He told me so little of his past. He never explained to me why he worked his whole life as a gardener and then as a security guard. And even his cancer was something that I had to learn way too late from a nurse. How our immigrant parents cleaned toilets, took care of other people's fucking kids, took shit all day, struggled with rent, were chronically tired, all for us. - I remember Mom talking about my father a few times. The first time was around Christmas. The one before Francis died. - You didn't leave any for yourself? - Oh, I'm not even hungry. Eat up. I wanna talk about Christmas. It's gonna be a little quiet this year. Nice meal but no gifts. It's the economy. I'll get a new job in the new year, hopefully with some overtime. Grow up, Francis, be a man. Don't be a bitch like your father. - Look, I'm... I'm sorry I got angry, I get what you were trying to do. I should've warned you that we have to go slow with my Mom. It's not easy for her. - Yo, welcome, welcome! Come on in, pretty thing. - Thank you. - ID, please. - Fuck off, Dru. - Oh, yeah? Better watch your fucking language. - Yo! - What's up, little brother, you good? - Yeah, I'm good. Do you remember Aisha? - I remember Aisha. Hey, do I know your pops? - My dad? - Yeah, he's got good music tastes. And not a half bad singing voice either. - How would you possibly know that? - Listen, I just know things. I know everything that happens in the Waldorf! - Okay. - Hey, welcome to Desirea's. - What's this? - Oh, you didn't know? They're doing auditions. You could get a record deal. Jelly's gonna audition. It's time to take the stage, shine, represent. I'm his producer. - Alright, alright. - Who are you? Open the door! - Oh, shit. - Third time this week since Anton got killed. - Okay, whoa, whoa, what seems to be the problem, officer? - Conrad's Bar was robbed at gunpoint four blocks from here. Two Black subjects were last seen running down Warrens Ave. Anyone here seen anything? - We haven't seen anything, officers. - Alright, everyone stand up against the counter and keep your hands where we can see them, empty your pockets. Let's go, let's go. - You too, genius. - Yo, don't touch him! - Excuse-me? Okay, search them. Okay, alright, alright, enough. Let's go, come on. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your time. - Thank you, officer. - Whoa... - Good? - Yeah, yeah. I'm good. Just keep going. - Alright. I'll see you at the top, baby brother. - Whoo! - Let's go! You okay? - I'm good. - You ready? - Born ready, baby. Born ready, baby! Whoo! - What's up? - Is it time to go in yet? - Soon. - So we're ready now? - Relax, you'll get your turn. - Hey, you're next. They're good to go in. - Okay, superstars, you're in next. - Yeah? - You're going in. - Yeah? - Yeah! - Scarborough in the house! - Gentlemen, whenever you're ready. Let's see what you've got. - Come on Jelly, you got this, baby. Show them where you from, baby, let's go! - Alright man, that was pretty dope. That was off the chain. Like you're finally waking my ass up. Can't say the same for my partner here, but I like the way you was cutting up them ones and twos, man. Good record sources you got, you've got some real talent. Anyway, keep the peace. And stay in school, man. Thank you. Next! - Wanna hear some more from him or...? - We're good, man. No, thank you. - You know, he could do another set really quick. You know? - No, thank you. We've got another group waiting. - Um, so, you'll let us know if we win, right? - Yeah kid, we'll uh, definitely call you. Okay. So... That means the audition's over, and you guys have to get the fuck out of here. - Alright, hey, Francis, come on. Let's go. You did really good, Jelly. - Yeah, yeah man, for sure. Listen uh, we're still gonna celebrate, alright? I'm gonna meet you out back at Desirea's, cool? Want me to take that? - Yeah. - Got you, brother. - Appreciate you. - I have to go home and I'm gonna get a ride back with Dru. But I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Francis, you good, bro? Hey, Scarborough, man. See you, alright? - Yo, their set up was fucked up, man. Turn tables were too high. They didn't give us enough time. Yo, how are they even gonna contact us? Anybody see them take any numbers down? I'm gonna talk to the promoter. Hey, I need to talk to the promoter. - Sorry, guy, we're closed. - We just need to talk to the promoter. - You didn't hear me, you're not getting in. - You're not listening to me. We were just in there performing. Auditioning. - Oh, you were performing. - Yeah. - Doing your thing with your homies here, with your niggas. - Alright, we're going in, alright? We're going in. - I don't think so, nigga. - Alright, come on Francis, let's go. - Yeah, Francis. Why don't you listen to your little bitch here? - Stop! Stop! Stop! That's my brother, please stop! - Michael! Michael, wake up. There's been an accident. - What? - Your Mom. Jelly's with her. - Francis! Francis! Come on, get up! Get up! - We've gotta take him to a hospital. - No hospital. - Just take us home. Mom! Mom! - Francis? - Mom... - Francis, what happened? - I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry for everything. - I'm gonna get you help. - I'm sorry for being a shitty son. I'm sorry for disappointing you and breaking your heart. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. - Alright, it's alright. Sit down. Shh... Come here, baby, it's alright. Come, sit down. Sit down, baby. I'm not leaving you. I promise you. Mama's here now, I'm not leaving you, I promise. I'm just gonna get you something, some gaze, some ointment, I'm not leaving you. - Is she okay? - Yeah. She's gonna get you cleaned up, okay? - I'm sorry, man. - It's alright, it's okay. Just stay right here, alright? Stay right here. Mom! Mom, hey, look at me, look at me.

Come on, sit him down. - What happened? What happened? - Easy, home boy, easy. - This shit happened at the audition? - He needs to go to a hospital. - I'm not going to no damn hospital. - Francis, Francis! - You have to sit. - Sit down! - You have to sit. - Please, please sit down. What's your problem, Francis? You need to calm the fuck down! - Look at you. All of you. Fucking... Fucking losers. Fucking... Fucking nobodies. Just dreaming. - Francis. - You know? Just dreaming. There's no way forward. No way out, you know. Just dreaming. - Hey, hey. - Francis, can you please just sit down? Just sit down. Please. Just come and sit down. - Don't even hurt, bro. - Francis, you gotta let me clean it up. Just let me clean up the wound. Give me some alcohol. Gotta let me clean you up. Hey, whoa. Can we help you, gentlemen? - Yeah, we're responding to a call about a fight. - Well, we didn't see any fight, thank you, officer. - Yeah, what happened to him? - He fell. He got injured and we're handling it. - Alright, let's see everyone's ID. Up against the counter, you know the drill. Come on. - Let's go. - Come on! - Let's go. - No, hey. Fuck this. Fuck this. - You three, stand apart. - He's hurt, we're helping him. - We'll handle that, you do as we say. - What do we do? - You sit back down! - Francis! Francis, listen to them, just do it. Just do it. - Tell me what I did. I'm not a criminal. - Just stay where you are and don't move any closer. - Francis, go. - Think I'm crazy? You think I'm dangerous? - I think I want you to sit back down, sir. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Don't call me sir. Don't fucking pretend. You answer my question. You give me an explanation. - Do what he says! - Francis, please. Please. Francis, Francis. - No. No. - Francis! - It's happening today. Today. Gonna tell me what I've done? - Don't move.
