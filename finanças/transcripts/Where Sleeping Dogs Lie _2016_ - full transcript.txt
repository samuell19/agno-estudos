God, I love America, hmm? Every single Godforsaken bite of it. It's the only country that actively condones diabetes and obesity. You know, my grandparents came to this country literally fighting their way outta Germany and Italy during World War II. They weren't given a cent when they went through Ellis Island. It was like, hey, thanks for coming to the US. Here's another fucking boat, take you to New York. Oh yeah, but don't worry, because if the 28-degree weather doesn't kill you, then you'll either get, you know, robbed and beaten within an inch of your life or you'll just get robbed so you're left with less than what you came here with. Unless, of course, you're one of those lucky ones that's actually able to find a job and live in the back of a Goddamn dumpster for months on end to try to escape the gangs and the cold. Oh, and you gotta learn English, all at the same time. And when that happened, you really think the first fucking thing on their mind's being health-conscious? Hell, no. When your diet consists of bread and cheap meat, the last thing on your mind is obesity or eating healthy. I mean, hell, you were lucky to make it alive just to be fucking 50. So, you know, yeah, America, I salute you for your obesity and your ignorance to poison children on a daily basis with your $1.25 cafeteria fucking lunches. You know, it's not gonna refill itself over here. Can I get you anything else? I'm not even close to finished, and you're here ready to pile on more grease and cholesterol. No, I was... Oh, I get it. You're seeing if I'm ready for the check? No, I was simply just seeing if I could get you anything else. Cream, please. Thank you. Anybody sitting here? Hey, can I get you anything? Just coffee. Cream and sugar? Black's fine, thank you. Thank you. What? I'm here as a courtesy to let you know you need to settle up your debt with Bunny. Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck I am doesn't matter. What matters is that you've been given ample opportunity to pay back a debt that you owe. Now if you can't afford to pay it back, we'll figure out some kinda payment arrangement, but like I said, Jeff, I'm here as a courtesy. Mm hm. Yeah, I'll pay it. Good. Great. When can I tell Bunny you'll have her 135k? Buddy, I can pay it, okay? But Jesus Christ, I don't have that kinda fuckin' cash. What are you, Goddamn crazy? You got till the end of the month. Saturday the 30th, midnight. You know the place, don't you? Mm hm. Yeah, assume you'll be there one way or the other. Oh, and, uh, Jeff? I'd suggest not leaving town. That's probably the worst thing you could do for yourself. Fucking Prick. Jesus. Hey, can I get some more fuckin' coffee? Fuck. Broke my fuckin' nose. You have to hold your head back to keep it from bleeding. Yeah, I know. Did you find it? I found the safe. But there was nothing in it except for some papers and this. That's it? Yeah. Fuck. Where's Tim? I don't know. Over there somewhere. You left him in there by himself? It's not like the fucking guy is going anywhere. Tim, come here. You find anything? No, not yet. I need you to go out to his car, find a rag and some cleaner, wipe it down, all of it. What about him? He's not going anywhere. House wins Hey, help! Help! Help me! Help! Hey, help! You shut the fuck up. - Shut the fuck... - Help! No Shut up. Sit here before I decide to roll you on the ground and hogtie you, you little bastard. I really wish you wouldn'ta lied to me about the safe, Bob. Fuck You. I was really looking forward to finding something a little more worthwhile than this. Fuck. You wouldn't happen to have any idea where I can find the money you have lying around, would you? God, no. 'Cause you made it clear that you had a stash going for when you left your wife for the mistress, that she wouldn't leave you totally broke. Fuck you. Stan. Thanks. Thought you might want some coffee. So what'd you wanna meet about? Figured you'd come into the office to sign the papers. I'm broke. 100%. Minus a few assets that are getting ready to be taken and some cash I have hidden away. What do you think my chances are that she won't gut me for everything I have left? Cash on the books? What other assets? Cash was skimmed off the top of the business. Unless someone does some major digging when we tank, it won't show. And assets are the house, couple cars, few small items. You two good with just coffee, or do you want something else? Coffee's fine. I told you to have her sign a prenup, but either way, when the company goes under, stocks'll plummet, the house'll be gone, most likely the cars. Now if she knows about the cash, that could cause quite a stir if she tells anyone. She's clueless. Only thing she's worried about is the gym. Whatever guy she's screwing. You know she's screwing around? I have a feeling she is. But she knows I'm screwing around on her, so it evens out. Bob, does she know about the cash? I think she might know. I... Might and does are two completely different things. If she says something, you're looking at a world of hurt from the feds. Now we already know they're gonna indict on the fraud charges. Now luckily... I don't think they have much. It'll go to trial. I'm, I'm pretty sure we can win as long as we can keep her off the stand. How bad could it be, come on? Could it be, or will it be? You're looking anywhere between five and 20, depending on what they can prove, if she hits the stand. But only if she can provide some proof. Well, that money is the proof. Find out how much she knows. Hypothetically, if she did... Know things? If she knew things and you didn't want her to know things, these types of things. Right. I'm sure you could figure something out. Don't you think so? Happy hour. I'll stop by later to sign the papers. Thanks for meeting. You forgetting something? Oh, right. I think I can figure something out. Fuck. Come here. Fuck. You ready? No I'm not fucking ready. Okay, I'm gonna count to three. One. Two. Three. Fuck. Is it straight? Straight as it's gonna get. Hello? Hey... What are you doing? I think there's someone in the trunk. What? Shit! There's someone in the trunk! Who is it? How should I know? You think he kidnapped someone? I don't fucking know. Where do you think the keys are at? Bob has the keys. Now you listen to me. I'm gonna take this duct tape off, and you're gonna tell me where the fuckin' money is, and you're not gonna scream. Otherwise, I'm gonna break every one of your fuckin' toes, one by one. Do you understand me? All right. All right. Oh God. You want some water? Yeah. All right, all right. That's progress. Aw, you're a fuckin' choker, huh? Yeah, my ex had the same fuckin' problem. Listen, Bob. I know that your fuckin' wife is gonna be home in the next two hours or so. It's getting late, all right? I want to sleep in my own fuckin' bed tonight, and you, listen, you should probably go to a hospital at some point. So you know, where's the fuckin' money? Come here. Come closer. C'mere. All right, all right. Fuck you! Get the fuck out of my house! Fuck! Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuckin' piece a shit! Shut the fuck up! Shut up, Bob! Fuckin', Goddammit. Ow! Hold fucking still! Ow, motherfucker. I told you. I fuckin' told you. Now shut the fuck up. Hey, Jeff. What? Come here. Hey. Don't fucking move. Piece o' shit. What? Yeah, so there's someone in Bob's trunk. What do you mean? What do you mean what do I mean? I mean, there's a woman trapped in Bob's trunk. Well, who is she? How the fuck should I know? I didn't open it. Well, where are the keys? She says Bob has 'em, but do you really think we should open it? I don't know. We can't just leave her in there. She'll suffocate. I'm kinda thinking that might be the idea. Why don't we just ask Bob? Well, there's an idea. Ow! You're missing a toe, and you say ow to that? You cut off his toe? Yeah, he, uh, look, he wouldn't fucking say anything. You're a sick bastard. His toe? Shut up. Who's in your trunk? My wife. Your wife? That's what I said. Why's your wife in your trunk? I'm not going to tell you shit. You hear him? I say we let her out. Oh yeah, I say we let her out. Hey, now I'm guessing she's probably not too happy with you right now, huh? Well, maybe she'll help us out with this money. Where are the keys? I don't think that's a good idea to let her out. Oh, Bob, I think this is the best idea we've had all night. Now where are the keys before I tear off another fuckin' toe? Left pocket. Excuse me. Yeah. Fuck you, Bob. Uh, hey, uh, listen. If we let you outta there, you're not gonna do anything crazy, right? No, please. Please, just let me out. It's getting hard to breathe. Fuck. Can you help me out? Hey, uh... Yeah. Grab her legs. Swing 'em, yeah. Come here. Okay, come here. Okay, set her down. Okay. You must, uh, be the wife. Soon-to-be ex-wife. Right, uh, sorry, ex-wife. So hey, listen, we're uh, we're sort of, uh, in the middle of robbing your husband, here. Soon-to-be ex, ex-husband. Ex-husband, right, all right. So listen, we gotta, we gotta keep you tied up, sorry. We gotta get you in the other room. Let's stand you up. Ready? All right, here we go, standing up. Okay, just grab her legs. That's good, now lean back. There you go. Relax! Relax, relax! Just... Relax. All right. All right. Okay. All right. All right, now, considering that you two clearly hate each other, I can't exactly, you know, use you as leverage, so would somebody please, please, for the love of God, just tell me where the money is in this house? Money? You think there's money here? I've searched this house high and low and I've never found a dime. I told you there was no money here. What? I told you, there ain't no money here. It's all tied up in assets and bonds. What'd you do that for? He's lying. He has to be. We didn't come here for nothing. There's nothing, trust me. I do not believe her. Oh, God. Fuck! All right. Tim. Hey, come here, hey. I need you to stay here and watch these two, okay? Yeah. All right, all right. You come with me. I'm gonna tear this Goddamn house apart. Fuck you, Bob! You guys wanna watch TV? And we'll hear the latest on the man who pointed a gun at a television reporter. Angeles Police thought that the murder of a young woman last March was an isolated act of violence, but since then, they've come to believe it was connected - to a wide-ranging... - Hey. Series of assaults by a killer... - Be quiet. - Who's become known as the Night Stalker, a killer who apparently struck again during the week. It's just that I'm, uh... Police today continued to search for any clues... - I'm a little thirsty. - In the near-fatal shooting of 29-year-old William Karnes and the rape of his girlfriend. They're apparently - the latest victims... - Can I have just uh... Of the Night Stalker, thought to be... - A little bit of water? - Responsible now for 34 brutal attacks, 14 of them fatal. These serial killings, once confined to the near Los Angeles area, are now spread over 500 miles from San Francisco to Orange County. Just as before, the assailant entered a house... - I'm a little tied up. - In a quiet middle-class neighborhood in the predawn hours... - Right. - On Sunday via an unlocked window. Lean back. The attack had come while they slept. Neighbors are terrified. I just sleep with my hand on my, right by my bed and a sawed-off shotgun, which I always have. I see. Why is that? 'Cause if someone - comes into my house... - Shit! They're not leaving. The killer, who attacked randomly, is described as white, 25 to 30 years old, with a predominant feature - of teeth... - Oh, I'm sorry. So 5,000 fliers have been distributed - to Los Angeles dentists... - Did I do that? Asking for help with identification. And last week, San Francisco mayor Diane Feinstein announced ballistic tests have definitely linked the murder of a man there to the Night Stalker, but release of that information has outraged a Los Angeles sheriff frustrated by the difficulty of tracking a random murderer. It places this community in jeopardy because it impedes our ability to go forward fully with the investigation. A total of $35,000... Fuck! Fire officials in California tonight as hundreds of thousands of forest land continue to burn. The numbers are certainly worse. Lightning has caused some 13,000 fires now, charring more than 334,000 acres in California alone. It's not getting better, it's getting worse. Everyone shut the fuck up. Don't move. Tracy? Bob? Sh. Hm. Oh, God, you startled me. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you come in. I'm working on the pipes in the back bathroom. Oh, I didn't realize. I didn't see a van or a truck or anything in the driveway. Yeah, I'm a good friend of Bob's. I just rode along with him. Well, where is Bob, then? He's in the back with me. It's gonna be a long night. Big mess. We're not gonna be needing this tonight. What happened? No, oh no. What the fuck happened? She just kept backing up. Got, got startled and slipped. She dead? I don't know, Jeff, why don't you check her pulse? Of course she's fucking dead. Look at her skull. I'm pretty sure that's skull on the floor! Oh my God, no, no, no, no. What the fuck did you guys do? She, she's dead. We're totally fucking screwed now! Hey! Would you just go wait in the other fuckin' room? I fuckin' knew it, man. I knew something would go wrong. And this? This is all wrong! Look, just go in the other room. We'll deal with this. Did you guys even find the money yet? I told you, there's nothing! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Hey, look, we just need to leave now. No, not yet. Now go wait in the other fuckin' room, okay? Listen, listen, listen. This, this, this is all wrong. All of it! Dude, I'm pretty sure she's dead. How heavy do you think she is? I don't know, why? I mean, she can't weigh more than, what, 130, 140? Why? Well, we can't just leave her here. Sure we can. We're not murderers. She slipped and fell. Barry. Come on, man. We're in this thing deep now, okay, whether you like it or not, huh? What do you propose we do? Well,... Fuck. We could, uh, we could saw her up. I'm not sawing up a dead body! Not gonna happen! All right! It was an option. I thought I'd throw it out there. We could... We could roll her up. We could roll her up in one of those, uh, the fuckin', fancy rug. You know, at some point, we're gonna have to discuss what to do with the other two down there. Tim! Tim! We need you. Come here, Goddamnit. You, you are in this! Look, man, you're in it. Okay! Well, what are you thinking, huh? What's your big plan? - We just... - We do not have time for this shit. We're working on it, okay? Hey, right? We're working on it, okay? Listen to me, I am not gonna let anything happen to you. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Or to anyone else. Used cars. Hey, man, what are you up to tonight? Nothing, especially if my day keeps going like this. I hate it when parents come in with their asshole teenagers to buy a car. Yeah, well, you ever think your shitty attitude has something to do with you not getting a sale? There's a chance of that. What do you want, brother? I have shit to do. I got a proposition for you. Might help get you outta some of your money troubles. Sure, but don't expect me to go to the track again. Nah, it's nothing like that. Can you, uh, meet me at Stockman's tonight for a beer at seven? How long you been up? Um, a couple minutes. Then why are you wearing clothes? Why the fuck are you wearing clothes? Seemed like the thing to do before you got up. Well, now I'm awake. Yes, you are. You wanted to see me? Yeah, Barry, come on in, have a seat. Hey, Barry, why don't you take a look at this? Take a look right here. You see where Mike and Colleen really knock it out of the park? Here, take, take a closer look right here. You see, Barry, this is where you just keep falling off and finally fall off dead last. I'm gonna have to let you go. I need to make for someone who's a little more interested in getting customers in the door. You know, I hated this fucking job anyway. Yeah, here. What do you care, you fucking asshole? Listen, you can rot in hell for all I fucking care. Oh, fuck! Come on! Come on. What was that? Where's Tim? Hey, where the fuck is the woman at? Shit! Oh my God. Hey, doesn't he ever wonder where you are at night? No. He's too busy worrying about screwing his secretary and moving money around. Mm. Fucking irony is astounding. Uh, what? You know, secretary. Mm, right. How much money did you say that he keeps on hand? Least half a million, why? Because that is a lotta cash to just keep lying around, hm? Yeah, well, he's paranoid. He hides everything from me. Well, I know he's got it somewhere. Who knows? I know his lawyer is trying to hide everything else from me. So he may have already moved it. Hey. Hm? When is everything final? Soon as the deal is done. I want half. I deserve half for putting up with this shit this long. Mm hm. Am I gonna see you tonight? I can't tonight. Why? He's got that fundraiser thing. Needs me there to keep up appearances. Hey. Mm? You gonna be okay till Thursday not seeing me? I don't know. I'll figure it out. See ya. Yeah, later. Oh my God. I, I tripped, and, the gun went off! You tripped? And hit her right in the skull? Well, I was running after her. Look, I don't know how it happened, okay? Well, what the fuck do you wanna do now, huh, huh? I didn't mean to kill her. We know you didn't mean to, but now we have to do something with her. We can't just leave her here. You answer me this. How in the world, if you were watching her, did, uh, she manage to get loose, and run out the fucking back door? I don't know! It all happened so fast. I don't know! Okay. Okay. Wasn't he trying to kill her anyway, huh? Why don't we just put her back in the trunk? He has a point. This thing goes any more South, it, it gives us an out. Yeah. Well... It's not like we have much of a fucking choice now, is there, huh? Fuck! Oh, shit. Fucking. Hey, right, don't step on the fucking body. I see her. Fuck! Ah, ah, shit. Where the fuck is that gun? I don't really give a shit. Who's got the fucking keys? I don't have 'em. I don't fucking have 'em. You've got 'em. Goddamnit! Fuck! Ah, God. I got it. Fuck! Ah, fuck. All right. Put her, uh, put her head in first. You think he'll be all right? What do you wanna do with the body? I say we just put her in the trunk. Okay. Right, one, two, three. Why's she gotta be so Goddamn heavy? You think she's heavy, you have the light end. Light, my ass. Come on, set her down, set her down. What's wrong? Nah, just, bitch is heavy. Can we just please get her in the Goddamn trunk so we can finish what we came here for? Jesus. All right. Ready? Okay, one, two, three. No, I say head first. No way, man. You could put her legs around the other head, head and neck area. Look, you put her head in first, and then I can drape her over the other one and shove her legs in afterward. Okay, whatever you say, man. Come on, man. I doin'. Go that way. Go that way. Hey. We gotta push her. Hey. I told ya. Close the trunk. Oh my God, man, Goddamnit. I told you she was too fuckin' big! I'll get it. Dude, we have to move her. Fuckin' told ya. I just hope her head isn't busted all over the place. Who gives a shit? Aw, what's up man? You look like shit. What can I get ya? Two shots. I hope you're payin'. Oh, been a long day dear? Long fucking life, man. I thought I finally had a sale, then poof, done. Here you go. Nine bucks. Well, don't go reaching for your wallet too fast, Jesus. Keep it. Thank you very much. Hey, you ever think maybe you're just not cut out to sell used cars. Well, it's funny you mention that. Why? They finally can your ass for not selling anything? Well, shit. Here's to a new start That's what the fuck I'm talking about. Hey, bartender, could I get two beers and two more shots? Sure, what do you want? Uh, hey, do you care? No, whatever's fine. Um... Give me two Old Hangtowns. Good choice. You hear that? Good choice. You just want me to start a tab? Just start a tab. I have a feeling we're gonna be here for a while. Okay. Have an ID? Yeah. I need to hold it. Thank you. What are you so chipper about? I'm no more chipper than I normally am. You seem like it. I might have something. What kinda something? Something to get your sad, pathetic ass out of the credit card debt you're in. You don't fucking learn, do you? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Well, you've been out for what, seven months? It's not like that. It's an easy in and out. Nobody gets hurt. Hell. Nobody'll even fucking be there. Be where? Look, we need you on this. I need you. Whoa, whoa, we? Let me guess, you've got that little asshole Tim chasing your coattails again. Ah, whatever, man. Look, I need you on this. For what? A couple hundred dollars? Risk my neck for that shit? No way, I'm good. Yeah? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? You've been in and outta jobs for years. What, are you gonna go back to selling fuckin' used cars? I'll find something. Hm. What if that something was $200,000, maybe more? You've never known anyone with that kinda cash. I know a guy. He's going through a divorce, all right? His wife is trying to take him for everything he's got. The kicker is, she's trying to rob him because she knows that he's broke except for a buncha cash that he's got in some safe. So you want to rob this guy? Yeah. Bartender. What do you need? Few more shots. I need to get drunker to mask the stupidity coming out of his mouth. You got it. I gotta take a piss. What's up, man? You know there's no fucking way out of this now. Hey, of course there is, all right? Look, Bob was trying to kill his wife when we got here, all right, so we'll just, we'll make it look like he'll take the fall for everything. You don't get it. I'm not a fuckin' murderer. And none of us were until tonight. We just need to leave. Listen, Tim. If we leave Bob tied up down there, he's gonna pin it on us in a heartbeat. Hey, hey, hey, hey... Use your fuckin' head for a second. What do you think he's gonna do, huh, huh? Think about it. Where's this Goddamn money then, huh? Well, don't you think we would've found it by now? What if it's not here? We shoulda found it by now, but we know it's here. It's here, okay? It can't not be here! Hey, look at me. We will find it, okay? Okay? Okay, okay. I need you to listen to me very carefully. Nod if you understand. Your wife's dead, your neighbor's dead, and you're missing a toe. So don't think for one moment that we won't put a bullet in the back of your head and leave this all pinned on you. We need to know where the money is. You wanna say that again? Water. Lean back. Money. I told you, there isn't any. It's all gone. All of it. I've been trying to tell you that. It all got sunk into stocks, bonds, investments. Every penny. I had no choice if I wanted to hide it from that money-grubbing bitch. Better not be fucking with us. You piece of shit. Fuck. I told you, man, we just need to leave. Fuck! Hey, you need to shut the fuck up. We are too far into this! What the fuck was that? Hey, what was that? Hey! You cocksucker, you, help me. Fuck, fuck. Oh, shit. What was that? Where the hell did you think you were going? Just stretching my legs. I'm gonna shoot this piece o' shit. Wait, wait. I can't do this. Hey, kid... I can't watch this. Get me outta this. Take me to the hospital, and I'll split the money with you. Goddamn! I knew there was money, you cocksucker! Fuck you! Kid, there's $100,000. It's all yours. This isn't right. Hey, listen to me. You go in the fuckin' kitchen right now. Get in the other Goddamn room. Fuckin' go! Look at me. I'm gonna put a fucking bullet in your Goddamn kneecap if you don't tell me where the fucking money is. Son of the bitch! Try the other kneecap? Fuck you! Goddamn, I'm gonna shoot this piece of shit! Wait, don't shoot! You see a phone book around here anywhere? Phone book! Fuck you want a Goddamn phone book for? Piece o' shit. I can't go back to prison, man. You're not going back to prison, kid. See a phone book around here anywhere? Over there. Found it! No, no. Now do you rememeber? There's no fuckin' money. Hey! Hey! We need to get the fuck out of here. It's 3:00 a.m.. What was that? You are gonna go to the bedroom, find a suitcase, and throw everything worth anything in, any jewelry, no electronics! Come on, man. Why can't we just leave? - It's over! - Because that's what I said we're gonna do. No money, we're gonna get something out of this. Now go! Now what? I'm starting to believe old Bob here. Either it's not here, or he doesn't give a shit, he just wants us to kill him. No, no, no, listen to me. I know that it's here, okay? It can't not be here! It might be, but we're running into daylight, and we have two dead bodies in the trunk of that car out there. So you're saying we give up? I'm saying, we need to figure out what to do with him and get rid of that car! You're saying we fucking give up? listen to me, okay? We have to figure this out! No, we have to figure out how to get out of here and not wind up in prison the rest of our fuckin' lives. Goddamnit! I'm gonna, I'm gonna tape up Bob, and why don't you go check on Tim? I'm worried about him. He's crackin'! He's fine. Kid's tougher than he looks. How you doin'? Are you all right? Do I look all right? I didn't sign up for this! None of us did. But we all knew it could go wrong. There's always that chance. Not this! Not murder. Do you even have a plan? Or are we just gonna keep stacking bodies in the trunk? Who's next, me? Jeff? Calm down. You can fuckin' calm down. Just hurry up. We have to get outta here. We need to figure this out. Tim needs to get outta this, and frankly, I'm a little worried about him. Oh yeah? Yeah. You're more worried than you were 5 minutes ago? Worried that he's not gonna be able to take it and talk. Or worse. Look at his face. Next time we see him, he is losing it. Remember, Jeff, he's your fuckin' friend, not mine. Don't worry about Tim, okay? He just needs to get out of this fucking house, okay? We all do. Yo, I got what I could find. It's probably like $1,000 worth. Good. What about him? Oh, we're going for a little ride. Wanna go for a little ride, there, Bob? That'll be nine bucks. Jesus. I thought he opened a tab. Well, he does have one, but, uh, you don't. I need change. The safe. How do you plan on dealing with that? I got that covered. No way, man. I'm not walking into a situation without knowing for sure. All right. Look, I know somebody who's helping me out with the combo, all right? Somebody who's close to him. Like I said, easy, in and out. What if someone's there? How do you plan on dealing with that? Fucking deal with it. Look... Bartender! Hey. What? Nobody gets hurt if we do it quick, all right? The guy lives in the middle of nowhere, off a dirt road for Christ sake. Bartender. A few more shots. Oh. No one gets hurt? Fuck no, man. I don't wanna go the fuck back to prison. And Tim? We'll have him drive. In and out. No way I'm gonna let Tracy sink me like this. I'm not sure you have a whole lotta choice here. She has video of you with the girl. What's my best option? Honestly? You didn't have her sign a prenup like I told you to do. If you take it to court, you'll lose. Just settle. Let her have what she wants. If you settle, she won't take the company. Fuck, may be a good thing if she takes the company. You still have the rainy day fund? Yeah, 'bout a half million in cash. Something she can't get her hands on. Good. Keep it handy. Fuck. Jeff has the keys. Go get 'em. That's not gonna fit. Let's just put it in the back seat. Go get the fucking keys from Jeff, Tim. You all right? Yeah. Hey, you all right, or what? I'm good. Yeah, no, I'm good. Good. Hey, go in there and help Jeff clean up. We gotta get outta here. Oh fuck. All right, all right, all right. Jesus. Fuck. Fuck! Hang on. All right. Fuck! Okay, fuck him. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Turn the Goddamn.... All right. You ready to do this? Let's do it. There you go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Now shut the fuck up, Bob. Damnit Fuck. Damn it. Jesus! Get this out of my way. Fuck! Watch your fucking head. What the fuck? Ah, fuck. Bunny? How long did you think I would wait? I'm guessing a while. Look, I was planning to come and see you. Mm hm, I'm sure you were. I was gonna give you some time after you got out. After all, you did do three years for me. Yeah, um, what the fuck is this, hm? I mean, I thought my Goddamn debt would be paid by now. Mm. I mean, I did do three fucking years for you. Honey, you're good, but don't kid yourself. The only debt you paid was the interest. You still owe me. We have history. But don't think for a second I'm just gonna write off your entire debt to me. What good would you be to me then? Okay, listen. Look, you know that I can't get that kinda cash very quickly. You're resourceful. You'll think o' something. Untie him. What the fuck are we doing out here? We gotta figure out something to do with fuckin' Bob. I've already killed one person tonight. Now you want me to kill another one? Goddamnit, would you just calm down and drive? I am fucking calm. Does it not look like I'm calm? No, it doesn't look like you're fuckin' calm. We've got two bodies in the trunk and a taped-up dude in the backseat. I'm about as fuckin' calm as I'm gonna be. Shut the fuck up, Bob. Get him off! Get him off! I'm fucking trying! Fuck! Get him off! Bob! Bob! What the hell? Move. Someone move! Hey! Dammit! Hey, go after him! I've got a fucking shotgun in my trunk, a fucking shotgun in my trunk. Go after him. Fuck! Come on! Come on, come on! Why the fuck didn't you go after him? Goddamnit. 'Cause we're doing it together. Come on. Fuck. I got him! Fuckin' I got him! Yeah, don't shoot! Get the fuck down. You piece of shit. Get up on your fucking feet. Come on. Fuck you! Get the fuck, you piece o' shit. Goddamnit. Fuck you! Come on, you piece o' shit. What the fuck are you doing? Come help us! Get the fuck up, man. I know. What? You know what? Why did you do it? Hey, we all needed the money, okay? But you saw, there wasn't any, all right? So right now, we just gotta take care of this piece o' shit and get the fuck outta here. I was in your car. I saw the picture of you two. It was you? Shut the fuck up, Bob. Tim, listen to me, listen. You stay right there. You were like a brother to me! Why? Why'd you have to put us through this? Hey, look, I didn't care about her. Then why? She was gonna fucking kill me, all right? Who, her? No, not that fuckin' bitch, fuckin' Bunny! Bunny? Yeah. Man, what the fuck? Didn't you learn nothing? Hey, Tim... Look at me, huh? Let's just put our guns away, okay? You made... You made me fuckin' kill her. For what? Some petty bullshit you got yourself into with that gangster bitch? Come on, man! I didn't make you do anything! Christ, I didn't want her fuckin' dead! You were the one that was supposed to be watching her, right, not fucking me, all right, so blame that shit on me. Don't... No. No, no. Fuck! Get the fuck off me. He was never gonna let it go. What the fuck? How the fuck do you know that? The sun's coming up. Fuck! Fuck. Piece o' shit up. Hey, we gotta get his.
