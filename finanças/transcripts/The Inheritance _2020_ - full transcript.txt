(upbeat music) (car engine roaring) (metal clinking) (pages fluttering) (door creaking) (Julian breathes heavily) (indistinct) (instrumental music) - So what, you've just been like cooped up in your grandmother's house for the last month going through this stuff? - (laughs) well, I guess it seems that way, but nah, I'm just trying to make the place feel like it's mine and cleaning up, Old Head helped me with repainting. I even took down the old photos and everything. - Really? - Yeah, the only thing I'm trying to keep are her books and old records. - (laughs) Of course, you kept the books and records it's too much. - You should move in here with me. - What? (dramatic music) (instrumental music) - (breathes heavily) So the last time I saw you was like a month ago, and we watched that movie where the guy's house burns down at the end, and then you cried a little bit and didn't say much for the rest of the night. - Okay, wow. You crazy? That's "The Sacrifice" Tarkovsky is a genius. - Okay, my point being- - What? - We haven't been in communication lately. And for all you know, I could be seeing someone. Okay, I'm not okay. - Okay. - But the point is I could be. - Well, can you at least consider it? Think about it. Look at all this, there's a lot of room. - This was actually a conversation I had the other day was around like family structures. In the US families are formed of nuclear. It's very much like mom, dad, kids, you know, whereas at home you have a much bigger community and like your extended family is a lot more incorporated into what you would see as your nuclear family, you know, almost. So I find that to be quite different. I've also like done a lot of different jobs one being in childcare, so I see how families sort of operate here, and that's kind of strange to me that you can like call in a complete stranger and be like, 'Here's my six month old. Okay, there's milk in the fridge. Toodles." You know, (laughs) and like at home, you're just never short of hands. There's not a shortage of someone that you know very well to like help you with your children and your children's children and so on and so forth. - You don't get it? - No, it's like bottom is up. - Yeah. - The fuck are you doing? - This is how native people eat it. I don't need a fork, a knife (indistinct). - You're motherfucking from West Philly, you're not native. Cut that shit open, man. - No, I'm just fine. - Whatever, man. Just tired of my mom, she's tripping yo. She keep asking me if I'm selling crack and shit, bro. - Shit. - I'm like, "Mom, like who keeps selling crack? It's like 2019." I don't know, man, she's crazy. But like I keep trying to tell her like, "Look, it's painkillers, that's the wave now." - For real? You know, the doctors are pushing that shit. And all the reason why I go to jail, is 'cause I ain't got a license. I'm just gonna get drunk or fucking. Y'all, I'm gonna get at you. I got deliver a package for my man, all right? - All right, cool. Well, tell your mom I say hi. - She's always asks about you. - Bye, Rich. - Gwen (wind whooshing) - Our first step therefore, must be to reeducate ourselves, to regain a former attitude of mind. "In our traditional African society, we were individuals within a community , who took care of our community and our community took care of us. We neither needed nor wished to exploit our fellow men." - "And then rejecting the capitalist attitude of mind, which colonialism brought into Africa, we must reject also the capitalist methods which go with it. One of these is individual ownership of land. To us in Africa, land was always recognized as belonging to the community. Modern African socialism can draw from its traditional heritage, the recognition of society which produced us as an extension of the basic family unit, but it can no longer confine the idea of the social family within the limits of the tribe nor indeed of the nation. Modern African socialism can draw from its traditional heritage, the recognition of society as an extension of the basic family unit, but it can no longer confine the idea of the social family within the limits of the tribe, nor indeed of the nation." - The foundation and the objective of African socialism is the extended family. The true African socialists does not look on one class of man as his brethren and another as his natural enemy. Ujamaa then, a familyhood describes our socialism. It is opposed to capitalism, which seeks to build a happy society on the basis of exploitation of men by men. We in Africa have no more need of being converted to socialism than we have of being taught democracy. Both are rooted in our past and in the traditional society, which produced us.' - [Woman] I know many of you are very enthusiastic about the candidacy of Congresswoman Chisholm. And just to give her an opportunity to address you for a short few minutes. She's only to speak for two minutes. No more. - I want to tell you that, (man laughing) I have always been a catalyst for change. And you're going to have the dooms day criers out here saying that the woman is crazy, she's nuts. But they said I was crazy from 20 years ago when I first emerged on the political scene. So let them continue to think I'm crazy. My brain power has been utilized by many persons within politics for 15 years. And a lot of you know what I'm talking about. You heard when it was time for me to merge, politically, they didn't want to, because they couldn't control me after they'd use my brains. You women better wake up if you wanna help to change America around. You go to work, you better wake up. And don't be afraid, have confidence in yourself. And the ability that you have is ability and talent given to you by God. And don't let anybody use you. Don't let people continue to use you and to manipulate you. The only thing that you have is your integrity and principles and the convictions of what we are fighting for in America. I believe that it's very important to consider first of all, that in a society in which a certain segment has the resources at its command, that the oppressive group has to recognize that you can take on that group into society with rhetoric or, you know, with rhetoric, with matches or stories or with bombs or whatever. That what you've got to do is to form coalitions of people in the society to move together, to make that particular group or that particular segment turn about or perhaps infiltrate that group and turn it around. It has to be done to the creative use of brain power and through the consolidation and solidification of people. It cannot be done in any other way because you don't have the resources at your command. If you want to indulge in rhetoric and you want to indulge it using your energy which can not give you effective results. That's another thing. In other words, I call that ego tripping. So you can't change the system by ego tripping. - [Reporter] Right. - All right? - right. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. (car engine roaring) (instrumental music) - [Gwen] We're still unpacking and sorting through some of this content, but feel free to help if you want. It's for a good cause, and trust me, you'll probably learn a whole lot more here than wasting your time and money at school. - [Stephanie] You know, it's funny how you educated folks are always telling the rest of us not to go to school. It's like, when I'm at the cafe all day those people who come in, get their $7 cup of coffee, stay there for three hours. Like they're definitely educated people. I don't know how do they have the time or the money? Just like, I swear you educated peeves, you're definitely conspiring to keep the rest of us out of the club. - The club? - [Stephanie] Yes. - You mean temple or like a zoo? There are way too many students and half of them are there to advance their career choices. It's pathetic actually. I'm sure most of the people working in the cafe are applying for jobs. - Yeah, but they still have money for their skinny, big double cup of a latte with a line, that quite much it does, right? And on top of that, they pull off and they're like, moms can be down Subaru. Let's not even talk about the rent. Girl. So one time this woman comes into the cafe tries to hit on me. I'm wearing this shirt, this is Bard, which I think is tight because I think it's like a poet or some shit. She comes in and she's like, "Did you go to Bard?" And I'm like, "How could I have went to Bard? I am a Bard." She just laughs, and she wants to know my story, but I thought it was a pretty good pickup line. - [Gwen] Okay, I'm gonna go out on a whim and say, this woman was white. - Yeah, but tell Julian I'm getting night education out in these streets, you know. It's the best place to learn. And we also went out for a movie. - Oh, okay. What are you go see? - "Negro Doppelganger", new film by LeBron Ride. I don't know, my date said it's supposed to be like a genius or something. She loved it. I thought it was okay. Just like so funny how hurt white people look when they love a black movie and you say you don't like it. Oh man, we went for a few drinks, like went back to her place and she kept calling herself poor the whole night, even though she ordered like three Negronis like, I don't even know what the fuck a Negroni is. - [Gwen] Wow. - We went back to her place, which is kind of in the hood. I thought I was gonna lose it. She had this nice ass place off Fifth Ave in Baltimore. And get this, of course she lives alone. - You're kidding. - I wish, at first I'm like, let me just bust in and then I'm out, right. And I was just like, fuck this shit. Fuck it. Like, why should she get to walk into my place of work, choose me and then I have to go home with her? I'm like, - [Gwen] What? - Maybe it's silly, but I just felt really empowered when I was like, I'm tired, like I have to go. But anyways, long story short, she was on that same don't go to school shit. But when it came time to talk about the movie, every other word had five syllables and was followed by a hyphenated last name. Like classic. - [Gwen] I hear you. (footsteps tapping) (metal clanking) (instrumental music) (footsteps tapping) (instrumental music) - Yeah. (instrumental music) - My first name is Old Head. I'm called Old Head, but my real name is Tyrone Preston. And we are in the House of Ubuntu. And it's a house that is focused and geared towards the preservation and self care of black people. And I'm here to learn and I'm here to enjoy, and I'm here to look towards the future, you know. (instrumental music) (indistinct chatters) (instrumental music) - Where did you learn that from? - That poem mean togetherness, like being a part of this house. To me, that's togetherness. That's being a part of something bigger than yourself. That's coexisting together and working to achieve a cause that we all are fighting for. Equality, justice for all, love and love one another. (smooth trumpet music) - "The bushwazee tries to stifle the explosive transformative nature of art, it's magical properties, except as correlative to religion or illusion or as nifty advertising. Art is a human expression of endless birth and rebirth, the big bang of universal of becoming, the being produced manifest of ecstatic fire. Space into speech, vision as a science of motion." - "The transformative power of art as opposed to ain't, life versus death, creativity versus destruction is the essence of the dialectic, which confronts us and informs our work. So that now asked first of the would be revolutionary artist for whom, ie for whom do you write? Secondly, Mao asked, "What do you celebrate? And what do you attack? From this we can tell whose side you're on, the oppressed or the oppressors." (dramatic music) Revolutionary art is the eternity of the world. The endless breath, the endless heartbeat. To deny it is to lie. And truth is the final reality. We are taught to deny the power and force of art except as elitist license." - "We do not believe our poetry can function as a force of nature to transform and cleanse and destroy and resurrect." - "We settle for being craft persons, fashioning, cunning little artifacts, devils use to drink blood. We are the good manners of vampires." - "We settle for being craft persons, fashioning, cunning little artifacts, devils use to drink blood. We are the good manners of vampires." - We settle for being craft persons, fashioning, cunning little artifacts, devils use to drink blood. We are the good manners of vampires. - We settle for being craft persons, fashioning cunning little artifacts, devils use to drink blood. We are the good manners of that empires." - 'We settle for being craft persons, fashioning, cunning little artifacts devils use to drink blood. We are the good manners of vampires." - "We settle for being craft persons, fashioning cunning little artifacts devils use to drink blood. We are the good manners of vampires. We settle for being craft persons, fashioning, cunning little artifacts devils use to drink blood. We are the good manners of vampires. - [Rich] Some of this shit, my man, don't be doing it. You're both in some weirdo shit. - [Julian] Nah, it ain't that weird. - [Rich] Yeah, but Julian my man, I have been meaning to ask yo- (door knocking) - All right. Yeah, come in. - Hey, Jules. - [Julian] Yeah, what's up? - Your article on Trains and you're allover the news. - Nice. - You guys are crazy. That's you? - Yeah. - Yo, how comes every time I have a conversation with you somebody interrupts with some knowledge of self type shit? And what the fuck is Ubuntu anyway? - Oh look, Gwen came up... I mean, we came up with this way of organizing ourselves. So we're running the house like it's a collective now. - Hmm, collective? So I don't talk to you for a month, and now you run into code out of your grandma's crib? Yo, pussy got your tripping Julian. - No, no. - Pussy got you straight tripping. - No, it's not like that. Calm down. Look, it's just- - Yo chill, chill man, I'm just messing with you. You ain't got to get on the fools. Look. No disrespect, you know, but I wanted to ask you something before Miles Davis walked in. You know, I hate to ask it bro, but I need to place to crash man. - Oh, okay. So your mom put you out again? - Man look, man, I don't even know. This time I didn't even do anything. Like she's just straight tripping. Like she just wanna be alone or something, yo. - Okay, well, because we were running as a collective, I'm gonna have to talk to the group. We're operating through the principle of consensus, so I'm gonna have to talk to them and see what we can do. - Consensus? - Yeah. - What do you mean consensus? Yo dude, like you stay with my mom for like years, like dude, I ain't never really asked you for nothing so much as this. - I get it, I get it. But I have to put it on the agenda for our next meeting and then we have to discuss it. Like that's just the way it works. - Agenda? What are you talking about? Do you know who you're taking to, yo? You're taking this Ubuntu shit too far, man. Like I've never asked you for nothing, like one time one favor. - Okay, chill, chill. Rich look, I'll talk to Gwen. She's gonna be pissed at me- - See, that's what... See, I knew it, I knew it. She don't even like me. - No, its not that. - You don't even have to say it. - Look, look, listen, she's gonna be mad at me. She's gonna think I'm being a dictator. Like there are all these terms that she like throws at me. And so, but it's cool, it's cool. I'll talk to Gwen, I'll get Gwen on board and then we should be able to get you in. And it's just gonna take a little bit of time. Are you prepared to pay your portion of the cost share? - The what? - The cost share, we don't like the term rent is too feudal or industrial or whatever. - Cost share, cosco, whatever man, I got the rent, man. Can I stay? - I'm gonna talk to Gwen. - Can I stay, bro? - All right, dude, yeah, yeah. I got you. - Thank you, you're acting funny, man. Pussy got your ass tripping, yo. - Come on, Rich. - Nah, bro. - (laughs) You're funny. (gentle piano music) (car engines roaring) (smooth trumpet music) - [Patricia] Hi, how are you? - How are you? - [Patricia] Good. - That man, first Prime Minster of Ghana. - [Julian] Okay, okay. (smooth trumpet music) - Hi, guys. Welcome, guys. - [Old Head] Hello. - Thanks for joining me. - [Gwen] Yes. - We'll be having a workshop, a language workshop. What do you think about that? - [Gwen] It's gonna be great. - Better learn a little bit about it. - [Rich] (indistinct) - Right now? - [Rich] Yeah. Now, what were we gonna learn? - Nuer. Some word from Nuer. - Nuer? - Yeah. - There's a cologne called Nuer. - Yeah? - That's South Sudanese language. From one of many, many languages from South Sudan. So awesome. - [Gwen] Yeah. - You guys ready to start? - [Students] Yeah. - Actually, just to have an idea of what the language is compared to English, how it's written. - [Gwen] Wait? (foreign language) - (foreign language) Yes, sit down. - [Gwen] (foreign language) - [Patricia] Yes, you got it. - [Gwen] (foreign language) - [Patricia] (foreign language) Do it. - [Gwen] (foreign language) - [Patricia] Yeah. - [Gwen] (foreign language) - [Patricia] (foreign language). See it. - [Gwen] What about this- - [Patricia] What's is then? - [Rich] Is it good? Is it alright? - [Patricia] (foreign language) - [Students] (foreign language) - [Patricia] Yeah. - [Gwen] What's called kind of like, (foreign language)? - [Rich] (foreign language) - [Patricia] (foreign language) - [Students] (foreign language) - Like Charlie, charlie? - [Patricia] No. - Like I would say- - [Patricia] (foreign language) - [Man] (foreign language) - [Patricia] Yeah. See backward? See the right way. See backward, then out. - (foreign language) - [Patricia] (foreign language) So since we learn a little bit of how the language is written, and how you can say a few words, we're gonna practice this quote on the board. - [Students] (foreign language) - [Patricia] (laughs) Oh, okay. - [Rich] We smart. - Yes, you are, (laughs) smart. The Collective. - [Students] (foreign language) - [Julian] Okay. There's progress. - [Students] (foreign language) - That's deep. Hmm. That's a deep one. You gonna fall for that? (wind whirling) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Move does not believe in technology. They use a wood-burning stove for heat and they have no electricity, but they do have cars and they have a telephone. Why? all the answers are in the guidelines. Their Bible left by John Africa. - This room that you are in now has a great significance to us because this room, and in fact at this very table is where many early Move members get their first understanding of life from John Africa. We see John Africa then, rather we saw John Africa in the same way that people saw Jesus Christ, because of his carpentry, because of his simple way of living and so forth. Now we know that John Africa is a man who can explain Jesus Christ. - [Interviewer] How old is John Africa? - John Africa is one. One level, one grade of life. Everything you see, the sun, the air, the water that you drink off, all of that if John Africa, one force. - [Man] Blue to show call. (woman yelling) (dogs barking) And now the second day of August 1978, upon consideration of the then petition and accompanying affidavits, and upon the mention of Sheldon L. Albert city solicitor, attorney for the plaintiffs petitioner rule is hereby granted upon Janet Holloway, Consuella Dotsun, Janine Africa, Charles Sims- (background noise drowns out speaker) Gail Sims, Dennis Sims, Frank Sims, Carlos Perez, Michael Davis, Raymond roster, Robert Mosses, Sue Iron, Camille Hasting. - [Man] You really don't give a damn, come on with it. (background noise drowns out speaker) 307309 North (indistinct) street. (background noise drowns out the speaker) - [Woman] Are you serious right here? - [Man] You see there are cops right here, man. Once we go to court here's what I'm gonna say to this so called nigga murder. - [Woman] Is it gonna stop him from killing us? We've been going to court for six years and Bristol is still talking about bringing his bullshit out of the door. Too afraid they gonna stop choosing our home. - [Man] What are you talking about? I'm talking about murder in the same town. I'm talking about cops (indistinct) with machine guns and all over gutter. He can swear to killing somebody. This man is talking about killing somebody over so-called civil contempt of court. Which wins death penalty when the go to court. (fists punching) - [Narrator] Debbie Africa wearing the dungarees is four months pregnant, but she can still participate in the regular activity that make up the bulk of the Move members day. When the time comes for the baby to be born it will come wherever she happens to be, without a doctor in attendance, certainly not in a hospital. - [Man] 20 pounding. (fists pounding) (audience applauding) - And I thank you for welcoming us into the House of Ubuntu. My name is Debbie Africa. I'm from the Move organization. Organization, first of all was founded by John Africa, black man, long time ago. I just came around in the '70s, in early '70s. Our belief is about natural law. It's actually just a belief that is really familiar to everybody because everybody has to breathe, everybody has to eat. Everybody has to endure and enjoy and live by the natural standards of all of life, which is the air, the water, the soil, nobody can do without it. Nobody can do it out. It can't be disputed. John Africa just breaks down the causes of people's problems like where people's problems are coming from. And that's the thing that actually really grabbed me, because he talks about a section on children and watch children grow up to be the way that they are, sometimes like dysfunctional or insecure. And he really breaks it down to me and make me really understand it, because it just explains how society just forces you kind of to love technology, to love things that are feeling less to love things that are meaningless, to love things that, you know, that don't have feelings. You know, a car, a chair, a floor, a shiny car, a shiny floor. But meanwhile, hurt child's feelings over that. John Africa also breaks down every other aspect and system too that has people drawn to the system to make them feel like they want it and they need it. And you know, he just goes into all those details about you know, I mean from the government to food, to healthy eating, to healthy living, to what you know, what people need to do as a group, as a family, as a world system, in order to fight the thing that had been put on us. Fight the diseases that have been put on us by mankind. And it sounds really complicated and deep, but it's really not deep at all. It's very, very simple. Very, very, very simple. Humans are no better than animal life. Animals are no better than plant life. - [Interviewer] Where is John Africa? - That's organization business right now. - [Interviewer] What do you mean it's organization business? You're asking people to believe in the philosophy of this man. Why can't he come forth and speak it himself? - Teachings of John Africa are inherent in his disciples. His works are shown in the healthiness of our children, the sturdiness of our building, the way we live, all right? What we're saying is that for security reasons, John Africa whereabouts are organization business and we will keep it that way. We're not asking people to idolize a figure, a so-called leader as they have done in the past, what we are asking people to do is take serious look at their lifestyle as John Africa has said, see it for what it is, and do away with it, all right? That has nothing to do with idolizing John Africa. We the members of Move have a great reference for the man, for the founder of this organization. That has nothing to do with any mystical. Okay? Any foolishness. So this man isn't asking people to buy him any catalyze, he ain't asking people to worship him. All he's asking people to do is be right. And for that, his presence isn't required. - My name is Michael Africa Senior. I'm a member of the Move Organization. And I'm gonna talk a little bit about how I met that amazing woman that was just up here. She belonged to amazing family. Her uncle was John Africa, at the time, I just knew him as uncle Benny. A lot of things were going on in the neighborhoods, and the community. You had the Black Panthers. You had the Black Liberation Army. We had other groups and other social ills that was happening in the community. I wasn't really that aware of much of it, nor did I really care to be. I was a Marine, so I was going the other way. But being around an organization, I started seeing some of the things that were happening in the community. And then after I met some members of Move Organization, I did become aware of a lot of social ills. And becoming aware makes you caring, makes you angry, and it compelled me to get involved. and get involved that did - [Student] When was there a true turning point from like the life you were living into you really subscribing to the sort of like natural law that John Africa... - All right, it seems like when you hear the story, it sounds like I would have taken a long time, but I really wasn't. I met Debbie when she was 14. I was 14 also . 16 I joined the Marines. By 18 we were fully involved in Move organization. And by 22, we were doing 100 years in prison. - [Student] Wow. It was relatively a short time. We did 40 years. We just got out of prison. I've been out of prison for seven months. Debbie been out for 11. - [Rich] Okay, so what did you go away for? - A confrontation in 1978 with 600 cops that had converged on our home and they attacked us. And so out of that case, we were charged, all charged with a third degree murder. We were all sentenced to 30 to 100 years. And after we were eligible for parole first, 10 years ago, and they kept on giving us hits, one, two year hits. Well, I got one five-year hit one time. And anyway, throughout that whole journey, a lot of people supported us. A lot of people fought for us. None more than my son here. And they brought us home. My name is Michael Africa Jr. I'm a member of the Move Organization. I've been a Move member for a long time. I was actually born in the organization. My mother and my father are two members of the organization as you just saw. My mother had me shortly after the August 8th, 1978 confrontation, when the police stormed our home and you know, they shot the water cannons and the tear gas and all of the, you know, these tactics that they use to attack people. And they did all of those things to our house and they arrested them. And I was born about a month later in a prison cell. When I was born, my grandmother came to get me from the prison or from the hospital after. And we went to Virginia where John Africa had what was called Seed of Wisdom Chapter. And that chapter was set up so that Move children could get away from the confrontational atmosphere in the city of Philadelphia. And while we were there we were trying to live peacefully. While we were there, the same kind of situation happened where the police came and raided our house there. They arrested the adults that were there. They put the children in an orphanage. And myself along with 14 other children were in that orphanage for 11 days where we were abused, our hair was combed and ripped out of our scalp. We were grieving because of the loss of our family. And we would not eat, when we would not eat, we were forced fed and so forth and so on. And eventually the people, the adults that were arrested came to the orphanage and they got us out of there, and they took us back to Philadelphia. And when I was a young child, my grandmother who I was living with, she decided to leave the organization. When she left the organization, she took me with her. while I was gone, my cousins and I and my sister, we made a pact that when we got old enough we were going to come back to Move. At the time I think I was about five or six years old, but I was determined because I always loved Move. I always loved the teaching of John Africa. I always loved my family, and the separation was more than I was willing to accept. So we made that decision that we were gonna come back to Move when we got old enough. (water burbling) (bomb blasting) - [Steven] What was that sound Harvey? Can you tell us? - [Harvey] I can't tell you, Steven. - [Steven] Why not? - It's heavy. And I don't even know it was a gunshot. It almost sound like an explosion. - [Interviewer] Could have been the lobbing of a tear gas canister. - I don't think so. Tear gas doesn't make that kind of sound, that shook the whole block. (dramatic music) - In 1985, they came out to our home, attacked our home, and they dropped a bomb on our house. That bomb ignited a fire, within the fire was 61 homes in the area. But within the house where the bomb was dropped on, where the fire was raising was 13 Move members. Of the 13 move members, 11 of them perished in the fire. The lone adult survivor, who is Ramona Africa, she was arrested for that. And she was put in prison and she spent seven years in prison. Birdie Africa, who was the lone child survivor, he was taken away from the organization, and I never saw him again in person. But Ramona who went to prison, she was actually an inmate at the same prison that my mom was at, when Ramona was set to be released from prison after that seven year prison term, my grandmother and my sisters, we talked about asking my mom to ask Ramona if she would come and pick us up. And at this point we were looking for that opportunity that we talked about to come back to Move. And Ramona came out of prison, the very next day that she got out, she actually did come and get me. She took me to Mo Africa, who is another member of the organization. She took me to his house. And when I went to his house, I began to remember the things that I forgot about. I remembered the smell of the Move houses and the children and the seeing them. And you know, because I was gone away from that for nine years. And as a child I couldn't remember all of those things, so she took me there and I fell in love with that nostalgia. I couldn't believe that I loved it so much and I couldn't tear myself away from it. I wanted to be there again. I wanted to come back the next day. And from then on I was there, and I started working on the case for my parents and finding out what was going on with them. And I learned that they had 100 years of prison and I started working on that case. And it was very natural. The transition was very natural, you know. And speaking about their case, you know, somebody said to me they said you were born in prison, and then you went back to the prison to get your parents out of prison. You know, and that's what I've been doing. That time from 1992 up to 2018. We talk about natural law. We talked about diet, eating healthy, right? The essence of John Africa's teaching is self, take care of yourself. When you take care of yourself, all of the things that we do as revolutionaries is really all in that. If you think about self and you take care of yourself, you don't have to think about trying to be an activist for the environment. You don't have to try to think about being an activist for political prisoners. You don't have to think about activism for animals. If you just think about yourself, that covers everything, because you're connected to the environment. And if you know that you need the air to breathe, why would you allow the system to create things that pollute the air? Why would you allow a system that builds atomic plants on the river, when the river is where your water comes from? (blender whirring) (grater grinding) (blender whirring) - [Man] WRTI maybe have one. Good judge who have no time. They may not be integral, it last a long time.

You're killing me y'all. - [Old Head] No shoes in the house. - [Julian] Wait, we went through this. - No, man, I thought this was supposed to be like some type of anarchy where we policing ourselves, man. There's no point in (indistinct) - We are policing ourselves, last week we all agreed no shoes in the house. Look, I'm trying to keep up with my grandmother's house. Can you please help me out here? - All right, man, all right, just relax, man. - Thank you. - [Old Head] There's no shoes in the house. - Yo, I heard him. Damn. - And Janet, what was wrong with you making all that noise last night? Yo, you like this big making a whole bunch of noise. Are you like wrestling day up there? - [Janet] What do you mean? - You're messing up my meditation, I can't focus. - [Janet] Since when do you meditate, Rich? - [Rich] Since when do you pay attention? I always meditate. I've been on my new chapter. - [Janet] Oh, okay. - [Stephanie] Hey, everybody. - [Everybody] Hey, Stephanie. - [Julian] Well, could you take your shoes off? We said no shoes in the house. - Julian, I've had such a long day, like I don't wanna do this with you. - Okay, you know what? It seems like everybody's tripping about this no shoes in the house. I thought about this, and maybe it needs to be a more affirming statement because we reached consensus last week. So maybe we should try, We are, a shoeless house. Can we say that together? - [Everybody] We're a shoeless House. - We all agree to it, so like let's do it. - Okay, we got it, shoes off. - Okay, yes, thank you. - I will hang this up. - Okay, we're waiting for, - [Patricia] Hey, everybody. - Oh, there she is. - [Everybody] Hi, Patricia. - Great, okay, now everybody is here, can we please get started? - [Julian] Shoes. Thank you so much. - Okay great, shoes are off, can we get started? - [Julian] Yeah, we're all here. - Okay, great. So I called the meeting into order. I just wanna go over last week to the minutes. Item one, we collectively have decided and settled no shoes in the house, so that's done. Number two, we came to a consensus about shared chores. So I came up with a schedule. Everybody take one. We've got cooking, cleaning, shopping. It's seven days a week, and I've assigned everybody. - [Rich] No, no, wait, I see you got me here on Sunday, Yo, I can't work Sunday, man, it's a Sabbath, you know that, I can't do that. - [Gwen] Okay look, we're just gonna have to bypass that right now. You can find someone to work or trade with. - Look, I'll cover it for Rich on Sundays. - Okay fine, good for him if you want. Okay. So as you can see, we're doubled up. So I have like, you know, Rich and Julian or Patricia and Gwen, for example. So that means you're going every other week. - Okay. - Yeah. So everybody's okay with that? We are on the same page? - [Everybody] Yeah. - Also, Stephanie helped to design. - Okay. Well thank you. I know you worked really hard on this and Stephanie so thank you all so much. (everybody applauding) Thank you. Okay, so next, I know a couple of a month ago or so, we talked about having an RPR library. At first it was gonna be in the back room, but Rich moved in there, all right So we need to put the library somewhere else. So where can we put it? - Sorry, sorry, sorry. What does RPR mean again? - The revolutionary people's reading room. - [Gwen] Yep. - Okay. - Okay. - All right. So where do we think we could put it? Can't be in the back room now. - [Jamel] Why not put it in here? Just add a few more bookshelves and chairs, make it really simple. - Sounds good. - Yeah, I mean, I'm not trying to be a counter-revolutionary anything, but like having random strangers in here, lounging around reading, doing whatever. I don't know if we wanna have much privacy. - I'm okay with it - [Janet] Yeah. - It's fine. - Okay, so it sounds like we've reached the consensus that we'll have the RPR in the living room. - [Old Head] Yes. - Okay, so moving on, we also talked about having a big event, a consciousness raising event here to kind of introduce us to the community. Let's decide if we want a speaker like a poet, a musician, like somebody. And let's remember, I just wanna point out, we wanna integrate and not alienate. So we wanna come. Old Head, go ahead, go ahead. - [Old Head] Okay, I got a boy named Harold who runs the AACG right down the street. - [Gwen] What is that? The African-American Gun Club. Hold up, he is the president of the Philly town (indistinct). Hold up, hold up. I say, listen, listen listen. - [Julian] Hear him out. Come on. - We have him come here, speak to us. Teach us about gun safety and responsibility. - [Gwen] Okay. - Let's have him come her speak to us. - [Gwen] Look, I hear you, I just kind of feel like we might want our starting point to be a bit more peaceful for our first- - No, no, wait, I don't know if you ain't been paying attention to the news, but shit ain't safe out there. This shit is for real yo. - Look, I hear you. I got you. I'm just saying it's our first one. So if we're gonna bring people in to what we're trying to do, we should just do it in a more peaceful way, just to begin with. - We're getting killed out there. - [Rich] Yeah, no lie Gwen, for real, like more men are getting killed with their hands up than their they arms out. - Martin Luther King Jr, walked around with a gun, right? Then why don't we? Let's get Harold in here and let's have him talk to- - [Gwen] Just not now. - No, no, no, no, no, no. My sister died on the streets. This ain't no joke. You saw what happened to Move. Right? Y'all need to grow up. (dramatic music) - [Rich] Nah, nah, look, look, I'm telling you, this ain't gonna work. This is what we should do, we should throw a community black party, we should get like a whole lot of kids involved, get a DJs, some strippers and like- (everybody booing) - That's way too ratchet and fluff, like- - [Rich] Who do you call ratchet and fluffy? - She is not, she is just... - Nah, yo, every time she starts to bring up something she's always on me like it's about me. - Have you guys not seen it ratchet? - Hey, yo, check your girl. (background noise drowns out speaker) (trumpet blowing) - You know, that rap it's just a bunch of noise anyway. - That's coming from the dude who plays the trumpet all day? I'm not hearing it. - On that note though, I do think that music would be a good idea. - [Patricia] I think Jamel here and Old Head should play something. - [Julian] Okay. That's the step in the right direction. - [Janet] I have an idea. - [Julian] Go ahead, Janet, I know you've been trying to get it. - Thank you, so I was looking around at your grandmother's book and I noticed that she had a lot of poetry by Sonia Sanchez. What if we invite her to read some of her poems? - [Gwen] She is a phenomenal poet. - and she's based here in Philadelphia. - [Julian] Yeah, you know what? I think that's a great idea. (upbeat music) - On April, 2018, Poet Magazine published some Haiku and Tanka that I did for the great Harriet Tubman, as some people called her General Tubman in those days. "Picture a woman riding thunder on the legs of slavery. Picture her kissing our spine saying no to the eyes of slavery. Picture her rotating the earth into a shape of lives becoming. Picture her leaning into the eyes of our birth clouds. Picture this woman say no to the constant yes of slavery. Picture a woman jumping rivers, her legs inhaling moons. Picture her right with seasons of legs running. Picture her tasting the secret corners of words. Picture her saying you have within you the strength, the patients and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world. Imagine her words. Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Imagine her saying I freed a thousand slaves, could have freed a thousand more, if they only knew they were slaves. Imagine her humming, ♪ How many days we got before we taste freedom ♪ Imagine a woman asking how many workers for this freedom quilt. Picture her saying a live runaway could do great harm by going back, but a dead runaway could tell no secrets. Picture the daylight bringing her to woods full of baboons. Picture John Brown's shaking her hands three times saying, General Tubman, General Tubman, General Tubman. Picture her words, 'there's two things I got a right to, death or Liberty.' Picture her saying no to a play called Uncle Tom's Cabin, I am the real thing. Picture a black woman, could not read or write trailing freedom refrains. Picture her face turning southward walking down a Southern road Picture this woman, freedom bound tasting a people's preserved breath. Picture this woman of royalty wearing a crown of morning air. Picture her walking, running reviving a country's Breath. Picture black voices leaving behind lost tongues. Picture her painting rainbows on a summer, bent people. Picture a woman, I say, picture a woman walking on freedom legs, a sea spray of life. A sea spray of life ♪ A sea spray life, life, life, life, life, life. ♪ Sister Harriet Tubman, a great freedom fighter. (upbeat music) - [Gwen] African quarter of Leopoldville, natives are gathered around the salesman who's making a speech. Fear is being dispensed from the stand. Two Belgian cops of looking on rather suspiciously. - Friends, the white man have invented a lot of things and brought them here to our country. Good things and bad things. I won't stop to talk about the bad things today, but take it from me, friends, the good thing is beer. My advice to you is to drink, drink and drink some more. Come to think of it, do they leave us free to do anything else? If we get together, we end in jail. hold a meeting, jail. write an article, jail. Try to leave the country, Jail. The more of the same, but you don't have to take my word for it, use your own eyes. Now I've been talking to you now for about 15 minutes, and their cops don't even interfere. I've been doing the country from Stanleyville to Katanga and their cops haven't even bothered me. Why? Because I'm selling beer. Yes, you could say that here in Congo, a mug of beer is the symbol of all rights and liberties, but not so fast. Same as there are different races in one of the same country, that's right, even the Belgium's have their Flemings and their Walloons, and everybody knows there's nothing worse than the Flemish. Ah, there are different kinds of beer. Different races and families of beer. And I have come here to tell you about the best beer; polar beer. Polar, the freshness of the poles in the heat of the tropics. - Sure, but I hear that polar makes a man impotent, takes away his gigolo, What do you say to that? - [Old Head] That's a myth crack citizen. If I wanted to give you a mean answer, I'll tell you to lend me your wife or sister for a few minutes. - [Gwen] Laughter in the crowd. (crowd laughing) - (laughs) He's got what it takes. - [Old Head] But why not ask those girls over there? Those lovely little girls, we'll put it up to them. What about it, girls? You with the beaming smiles. you with the smooth snake bellies. You tell us what's what? - [Gwen] Girls singing. Women smooth as mirrors. Bodies without guile. Honey fritters hair, a shimmering water. Too ripe and flawless papayas for breasts. applause in the crowd. (crowd applauding) - Not too bad spiel. He's got a tongue in his head, I suppose so, but it's gotten me worried that beer mug of his is a grab bag. You never know what he's gonna pull out of it next. I've got a good mind to ask him a couple of questions. Watch your step, we can't interfere with the sale of polar beer. Don't you know who owns polar? - [Old Head] How should I? All I know is, that nigga is dangerous. You're young, just listen to me. The minister is behind polar. That's right. The minister of the Congo knocks you for a loop bay - From the top, assign is load from the grid, reading Brussels conference room. The anti-chamber of the room and the palace, four or five men characatures of bankers, dinner jacket, top hat, big cigar, are pacing about indignation and panic. They have just heard through indiscretion that ACLU members request the Belgian government has set the date for Congolese independence at June 30th, 1960. - We're screwed, our government are traitors has given away our empire. - They have set the date for the independence. - [Gwen] They've knuckled under that baboon. - Chin up gentle. Chin up I say. You've got to wed the spirit of the times. I don't say love her, it's enough to wed her. There's nothing so frightening about this independence. Oh, so he's kind of more chilled about it? He's not as worried? - [Gwen] Yeah, yeah. You need to, yeah. I want you to move it, but yeah, sort of but be a bit more pensive. - Okay, all right. - You know just, yeah. - You wanna take that again? - [Gwen] yeah, just be more, yeah. - Chin up gentlemen, chin up I say. (dramatic music) (instrumental music) (glass clicking) (water burbling) (spoon clanking) (jars banging) - [Julian] Coming. (door knocking) Yo, coming, just give me a second, please. - Fuck. (door knocking) Give me a second. Fuck, man. - What have you learned while spending time in the House of Ubuntu? - I think that like I've learned about a lot of like historical events that I wouldn't have otherwise encountered. For example, learning about like the Move Organization. And then I feel like it's kind of like leads you down this like cycle hole, 'cause like you learn about one thing, which then like pushes you in another direction, and it leads to a lot of like, I guess, personal kind of questioning, but then also just like individual work as well. (smooth trumpet music) (Rich breathes heavily) (door knocking) - Yo, man, hurry up, man. Five minute limit, dude, unless you wanna toilet. Damn. (smooth trumpet music) (Rich sighs loudly) I gotta shit man. Man, come on, what are you doing? (door knocking) - Yo, what are... You got a trumpet in there? You're playing the trumpet in the bathroom? What are you doing bro? - I like the acoustics. - [Rich] you like the ac... - The bathroom is for ass acoustics, bro. Ass acoustics only. - Your boy Rich is really out of hand, and you consistently enable him. You just sit there and defend him, like he doesn't know what he's saying. - Oh, what am I supposed to do? Rich and I go way back, you know this, is not like I can just like kick him out. - I hear you, but you also can't excuse his behavior. He comes in, he's rude to people. He tells people to shut the fuck up and our meeting includes Sonia Sanchez, which is completely unacceptable. - [Julian] Agree. I agree. - So you can't just sit there and be like, Oh well. - [Julian] I'm not, look, people were coming from different life experiences, different lifestyles, and we can't force people to get where we need them to be. We need to embrace where they are- - Yeah, and correct them when they're wrong. You can't keep babying him. - [Julian] I'm not babying him. - You're the one that wanted him here. He bypassed the entire interview process, and he's not even making that much of a contribution to the house. And I'm pretty sure he's been stealing from the non-community section of the fridge. The other day, Janet had a whole jar of Spirulina go missing. - [Julian] Well, how do you know what's him? You can't just accuse people. - because she asked him and he said, no, but she noticed he had a green stain on his shirt. What was he doing with it, anyway? You know what? It doesn't even matter. You need to hold him accountable and really assess your own behavior. - [Julian] Okay, I already said I'm gonna hold myself more accountable. - Just take a minute. (Gwen sighs loudly) - [Janet] I'm actually really interested in music and learning more about music history and especially jazz. And I don't know if you have any advice on where to start. - [Jamel] There's this real amazing album by Max Roach and Oscar Brown Jr. And Oscar Brown of course, does his thing, really great lyrics. But really the whole album is about freedom and the music, you know and how Abbey Lincoln is singing his lyrics. It's about like feeling how she moans, how the hysterical nature of all the things that happened with the drums, the trumpet, you know the rhythms, just represents true freedom. It's just when you're feeling something so overwhelming, at least for me. So I guess I would start there if I were you. - Thank you for your recommendation. All of that really resonates with me. That was actually beautiful. - Yeah, it's great album. I can talk about that all the time, you know? - Yeah, I'm definitely going to listen to it, so I can really hold a conversation with you about it. - I mean, we got into this together. - Yeah. I really like that.

Thank you so much for being here. This is the first of what we hope to be many community events. I'm not gonna be too long, I don't wanna say too much. But I just wanna say a few words before we get started. First and foremost I just wanna acknowledge my grandmother. My late grandmother, Elaine Johnson. Oh, thank you. (audience applauding) This was her house and this would not be possible without her, and you know, she's an ancestor. So just wanna take a moment to say thank you. Second, there is a wonderful woman who is here with us, my partner, Gwen, and yes lets... (audience applauding) Like with so many movements, with so many thriving communities, women are the backbone. And if it weren't for Gwen, none of us would be here. Her vision for this space, it came from her. So thank you so much, Gwen, you're my heart. (audience applauding) And finally, lastly, I just wanna acknowledge, I know we expected Sonia Sanchez to be here, Mama Sonia, but due to complications, she can't be here, but she sends us a wonderful gift. And so we are excited and thrilled about this gift. We have a poet who is world renowned, who Philly, Philly, Philly loves. And we're so grateful to have the wise, the beautiful, the talented, just awesome Ursula Rucker. Let's welcome her. (audience cheering) Thank you. Thank you. (audience cheering) - Thank you so much. It is such a pleasure and honor to be here in the beautiful House of Ubuntu. And I know you were expecting Mama Sonia.
