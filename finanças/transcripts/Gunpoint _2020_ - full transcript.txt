Hey, wait. Wait, wait! - Huh? - Shh, don't go in there yet. - Chris is asleep. - Come on, dad, it's my room! I can't do anything anymore. No TV, no phone, no computer, nothing. Shh. Come on, honey. I set the table for game night. Have a seat. Come on, we haven't had family game nights since- - Since mom died. Yeah. But Sarah's my wife now. She's part of the family too. You can't hate her for no reason forever. - No reason? - She's trying! She's trying to be my mother. She's just trying to be part of the family. - Why didn't you ask me? - Ask you what? If I was okay with that. Mom wasn't even gone for a year. You were only 13. And things don't always happen the way they do in movies. She helped me get through a rough time. What about me? You're right. I should've paid more attention to you. But there's no reason three years later we can't be happy. Your mom wouldn't wanna see us like this. Now, come on, oblige your father. Come on now, Nicole. Can you put the phone away for a few minutes? How about this? You beat me, you get to decide what we play next. Anything you want. I spoke to the neighbors before they left. They said they didn't receive anything saying maintenance was coming before the fumigation. Lisa from the first floor said they did. Well, nobody came by and I don't know Lisa. You wouldn't. So, it's nice to see you haven't cut classes lately. Now if we can just get you to pass a few. - Dad! - Okay, all right. We won't talk about that. So what's your real problem with her? You mean besides the fact that you spent my college fund on matching cars? Now, to be fair, your grades on getting you into any colleges. Besides the fact that she made us leave our big house to live here? Besides the fact that I'm 16 and I don't even have my own room anymore? Now, wait a minute. That's temporary. Besides the fact that she does nothing and gets everything and I have to "work for it?" I won, and you said I get to decide what's next. You're right. Nothing. I decided I don't wanna play any more games. Okay. Don't get upset, Nicole. Okay, get the door, before you lock yourself up for the night. It's probably maintenance. Hey! Hey. Hey! Sir. Hey! Hey. - Sit down. - What? Sit down! You come out. Stay. - Put these on. - What? - Put them on. - What do you want? Shh! Just do what I tell you to do and nobody gets hurt, okay? Put 'em on. Good. Stand up. Up! Put these on him. Sit down. Sit down. You come here. Turn around. Don't move. - Why do you need to do that? - Shh! Don't speak. - Come on! - Hey! Don't speak! Turn around. Sit down. Now I just need y'all to be quiet. This'll be over before you know it. Okay? Just tell us what you want. - Hey, hey, hey! - Please don't! Hey, that goes for you too. Quiet! - Help, somebody help us! - Nicole, stop it! - Help! - Stop it, Nicole! Shut, shut up. Shut up! You know what? No. No, please. No. No, no, no. Try somethin' like that again. Try somethin'. Why would you do that? There's barely anyone in the building! Everyone's out for the fumigation! We should've left yesterday like everyone else. It's okay, honey. Let's just do what he says. Once he gets what he wants, he'll leave us alone. Stop. What are you doing? Hey. You did jujitsu? When I was a child, yes. Hm. Nicole. No. Nice place. Hey, hey. This a gun box? It's a gun box. Where's the key? I don't know. Where the fuck you think you're goin', huh? Stop it, please! Hey, stop, stop, stop! Stop or I'll break your fuckin' arm! That's the last one, okay? Last! Calm down! Get up! Get up, get over there. Like I'm playin' with y'all. Get back over there! - Get up and face the window. - What for? Get up and face the fuckin' window. Stay right there. Don't you move. Come on. Turn around. Put your hands behind your back. I see you gotta leave. Turn around. Turn around. Both of you sit down. Where's the key? It's okay, honey. Get over. Get over here, get over here. Get over here! Look at me. Do you know where he keeps the key? You're gonna have to start answering me. I don't. I don't know! You don't know where the key is? - It's your gun box, right? - No, no. No what? No, you don't know where the key is? - Or no, it's not your gun box? - I don't know! Oh, yeah? - Please! - Shh. Dad, what is he looking for? I don't know. Maybe money, jewelry. I have some money in my jewelry box. - Maybe I should tell him? - No! He wants us quiet. Let's just do what he says. What money do you have in the jewelry box? Look, look at me. - How old are you? - She's 16! I thought you was like 19, 20 years old. This is your father? Yes. Tell me the truth. Did he give you this? No. - Did you give her this? - No. You're her father, right? Yes, but I buy her everything she needs. I don't give her cash. Interesting. Okay. So how'd you get this, huh? You work? No. Okay, so how? A friend. A friend? So a friend gives you $2,000 cash? What kind of friend does that? A boyfriend. A boyfriend? A 16-year-old boy got $2,000 to give to his girl? He's not 16. How old is he? He's 20. What? - Since when? - Since seven months ago. You were dating a 20-year-old man? You're 16! So? That's only four years. Mom was 10 years younger than you and now- - Don't you dare! - All right! All right! Why'd he give you $2,000? Because I asked. - You fuckin' him? - Of course not! - Hey! - She's 16! Hey, don't interrupt me when I'm talking! I'm talking to her. Okay? Don't... Hey. Don't look at him. Just answer my question. If I ask you a question, answer me honestly, and everything will be fine. Okay? So. Are you fuckin' him? No. You still a virgin? Yes. Hm. You don't look like no virgin to me. So what's the money for? A car. Why didn't you ask him, huh? I'm sure he could afford to buy you a luxury car or something. He doesn't want me to have one. Why not? You grown. She's not grown, she's 16! So what? I'm not a little girl, I can drive if I want to! With a junior license. You're not grown. All right, enough of the family drama! Where's the key to the gun box? I told you, I don't know. All right. You don't know where they are, huh? I'm gonna ask you one more time. Where's the key? I don't, I don't know! What's so fuckin' funny? Nothin', sir. You think I'm funny? You think this is a joke? No, sir! I don't think you understand how serious this is. But you will. You will, right now. - Sir, please! - Right now. Shh. Please don't hurt my son! Daddy? Come on, he's an infant! What do you want? I told you I wanted that key. Then what? I'm asking the questions here. Just take the case! Take the money and take the case! Now how old does he have to be before he can walk? There's no more money in the house! Can you stand up? Take my car! My, my car! You can have my car. The key is in the pantry. Please, leave my son alone! Come on! He's a baby, for crying out loud! Hey! Chris, no! - Shut up! - No, Chris! Shut up, shut up! Shut up! Dad! Shut the fuck up! You wanna lose another one? Shut the fuck up! This wouldn't happen if you'd take me fuckin' serious! Now where is the fuckin' key? - Where is it? - The watch case in my room! Oh. You got to excuse me. I gotta clean myself up a little. Why? Why? Chris. Now, I'll be right back. If you two even like y'all move an inch... She's next. You know what? No. Please, no. Just in case. Just in case. Now, y'all don't go nowhere, all right? Dad, Dad! Dad, we have to get out of here before he comes back. Come on, Dad. I need you to pull it together. Please, Dad! I need you to be strong. Dad. Dad, he's probably taking Chris to the incinerator. No! Shh! Shh, Dad. We can mourn her son later. What do you mean "her son?" Your! Your son! Now, come on, if we hurry, maybe we can hide on the other side of the hall. If he comes from the incinerator and he doesn't look, then maybe we, we go down when he comes back in and maybe, maybe we can catch one of the neighbors who hasn't left yet. Come on. Come on, Dad, what do you say? We might not get another chance here. Come on, please, Dad. You always told me to make a decision and stick with it, right? No matter how scary it is? Well, I'm making the decision. Please, Dad, we have to go. Let's go! Let's go. Come on! Dad, please. Dad, please. Please, Dad. Dad, please. Please, Dad. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. Shh, shh! Dad, shh. Shh! Honey, just go. No, Dad, not without you. Go, honey! I'll blow our cover! Get help. If something happens, just know that I love you. And I have faith that you can make good decisions without me. Okay? Daddy. - Go! - Daddy! When you get to a phone, get a hold of Sarah and keep her away from here. She'll take care of you. Go! Come back! Come back, come back! Why'd you guys leave the door unlocked? What's going on in here? Oh, my god, what the hell? - Leave, honey! - What? Please call the cops, now! My phone's dead, where is yours? - Sarah did you lock the door? - No. Lock the door, honey, hurry! Lock the door! Don't you dare. That's right. Keep goin'. Yeah. Have a seat. Now, how the hell did you get in here? Come on, let her go. Did I tell you to fuckin' talk? Huh? - I asked you a question. - She's my wife! Say another motherfuckin' word! Did you take this tape off? - Um- - Huh? Yeah. Don't do that. And why'd you take his off and didn't take hers off, huh? I don't, I don't know. I'd rather you take hers off. Because him, he has a hard time keeping his mouth shut. Come on, sweetheart. Your mom must not like you very much. She's not my mom. So who the hell is she? Step-mom. Well, that explains it. Please, sir. What do you want with us? Just do what I say. You do that, everything will be fine, okay? I ask you something and you answer it. Now, stand up. Turn around. Get up! Don't move. Yeah. Give me your hands. Hey! Turn around. Sit down. Can someone please tell me what's going on? You ain't figured it out yet? I have $2,000 in my purse. You can take it and leave us alone. And you could take my bank cards too. The code is two zero, two zero. So you do have $2,000 to give, huh? You just won't give it to her. Exactly. That's why girls start strippin'. How I raise my children... David? Dave, honey. He has the money. He can leave us alone. Sir, you have our money and our cards. What else do you want from us? Nicole? Nicole, where's Chris? Dave! Dave, where's Chris? Sir? My son. He's in that room and he's probably just asleep but he's just a baby and I need to make sure he's okay. Sir, this is important. He's just a baby! He's gone. What do you mean, gone? Dave, where'd you put him? Nicole, where's your brother? Where's Chris? Incinerator. What? What does that mean? No. No, no, no, no. What did you do to my baby? Whoa, whoa. Your husband killed that baby, not me. Killed him? What are you talking about? What is he talking about? What? I asked for a key. I warned him. And he challenged me. He killed that baby. No! No! Why are you doing this? What do you want? Okay. Okay! All right, you still got family left. - He was just a baby! - Listen! You do what I say and these things won't happen. I ask you a question, you answer it! Don't force my hand. I can't believe you let him do this to my baby! He's my son too! I tried to stop him. I can't believe you let him do this to my son! I would never let anything happen to our son! But you did! You killed him! Dad? I swear it wasn't my fault! Dad? Can't you see this hurts me just as much? - Dad? - What? Nothing. No, what? You wanna say somethin' so bad. Your brother was just murdered and you can just sit there like that! We're in pain here! We care about our family. What about you, huh? You selfish... You're a selfish little girl! He wasn't our family. What did you say? Nothing. What did you say? Say that again! I said he wasn't our family! You watch your mouth! I can't believe you! At a time like this! I could just... That's why you killed him. What? No! You know Nicole. She can be a heartless little bitch sometimes. It's true, though. Sarah, it's not true. Don't say that. No. It is true. I've been seeing someone else. What're you saying? Why would you even say that? It's true. It's not possible. Who, then? Christopher. From work. The 20-year-old intern. I named his son after him. I thought we named him after your great-grandfather? I know, and I'm sorry. And I have wanted to tell you, but I just... I figured you'd just, you'd figure it out, without me having to tell you. It's true, Dad. Shut up! You wanted this! You wanted something to be wrong with her all along. And how would you know and not me? Because I looked at him. I looked at him all day, every day. Shut up! It's true! It just... It just happened. And I know you wanted a son. And we were happy. Are you still seeing him? Why? I don't know. - Is something wrong with me? - No, no, no, no. No, nothing. No, you're... You're amazing. I don't know. The money. Did he give you the money? The money you had in your purse? Did you know Nicole has a 20-year-old boyfriend too? Yeah. He just happened to give her money too. Yeah. $2,000, cash. Oh, that would be perfect. Maybe you should ask her if his name is Chris too. Well, Nicole? For a million dollars. No, no, better yet. $2,000. Is his name Chris? You answer me when I'm talking to you! He's 21, and no, his name is not Chris! She's dating a more mature man than you and not bringing his kids home. - David! - Daddy. I can't believe you, Nicole. One lie after the next. And you. My wife. I'm sorry. I wanted... I wanted to end it, but it... I have his son. Had. Sarah. I didn't mean that, Sarah. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Sorry. I can forgive you. If you can promise me you'll end it. I can forgive you. I promise. I promise. Get up. Get up. Sit back. Sit her back. I'm tired of this bullshit. Jesus Christ. Okay. I got a question. Where the fuck do you keep the money at round here? You already have my cards! You have all my money already. The real money. That's all we have. No, it isn't. It might be all you got, sweetie. It might be all you got, step-mom. But you? I know you got more. A lot more. That's all I have. Before you start lying, ask yourself somethin'. Why did I choose you? What do you mean? You don't really think I ended up here by chance, do you? Hm? Hm? What're you saying? I'm saying, I know you. No, no way. Oh, I know you. You like to make large cash purchases. Seen it with my own eyes. In fact, I've been watching you for a while. You buy most of your stuff cash and you never go to a bank. - Well, sure I do! - No, you don't! Now, where's the real money? Clearly, there's a bunch of money stashed somewhere! Where is it? I don't use cash! It's usually cards! I have a couple of businesses. Remember what happened last time you lied to me? I understand! I'm telling you, though! I don't have cash in this house. I don't give my girls cash for that reason. - Still gonna lie to me. - How am I lyin'? I have money in different accounts. I'll show you on my phone, or my laptop. You have the cards, I'll give you the passwords! The cash! The cash! I don't care about your business account. Where are you keeping the money? There is no money! Okay. Can you cook? Answer me! No. Damn. You know how to make a sandwich? Yeah. Okay, good. Make me a sandwich. Get up. Turn around. Turn around. Listen. Hands. Go ahead. There's no cold cuts. You got peanut butter. Just use that. Don't try no funny business, all right? Just peanut butter. And water too. Yeah. Pick it up! Shit. If I was a rich man... Where would I keep my money? Wait! Put your hands on your head. Turn around. Now, you wouldn't be bold enough to try anything stupid, would ya, hm? You know I can. Relax, I'm just making sure you ain't bringing anything over here that might get you hurt. Shh. What the fuck is this? Turn around. What the fuck is this? Answer me! It's an emergency card. Get over there. What is this? Why didn't you tell me about this card earlier, huh? Oh. Oh, you don't know about this. Did you steal this from him? Hm? Oh, wow. Wow, they have to steal from you? You must be really tight with the money. I just took it for emergencies. Mm-Hm. You got one too, sweetheart? Hm? No! No, leave her. She doesn't have anything. Right. By the time I finish my sandwich, y'all tell me where that money is, okay? No more games! Think! What? - You want some, man? - No. Am I talking to you? You want some, man? Here. I come off too harsh sometimes. People say I come off harsh. Maybe I should be nicer. Okay? I won't be needing this no more. Well, let me explain myself first. This? This isn't random. I did my research on you. I followed you for a while. I watched you buy those cars a few months ago. Cash. All cash. You still got the money your ex-wife left you? I know all about the businesses. I'm saying you always have money. You've been lucky thus far. Everything you've got has been given to you. So you don't know what it's like to have to rob and steal just to survive. Technically, the money isn't really yours. All I want is the cash. You'll still be rich and you'll never have to see this face again. Hell, I'd be in another country somewhere. Most of your family are still here. You can have more babies with your young, beautiful wife. And maybe I can start a more honest life. Like you. Hell, maybe have a family too. Come on, man. All I'm asking is for the same break you got. For a lot less. Come on, break bread. Let's... Let's be more civilized about this, hm? Break bread with me, all right? Take a bite. First bite is yours on good faith. No. Huh? Kinda like a peace offering. No. - One second. - No. Shh. Shh. What do you say? Hm? No, thanks. Are you turning down my hospitality? No, I'm just not hungry. Eat it. No, please wait! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! If I hear either one of you say a god-damn word, I swear, everyone dead! Everyone! Come on. You think you're smart, huh? You think you're fuckin' smart, huh? No! Look away, Nicki. You fuckin'... Bitch! Damn! No! Bitch! Get up! Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. You's about to give me my break. Hm? David. You's about to give me my break, right? Okay. I get it. You don't wanna help me. Hell, you wanna help yourself. I don't wanna hurt you. I don't wanna hurt anybody. I don't. But if you don't start talking, I'm going to tear down your world. And then I'm gonna tear you down. Then I'm gonna find somebody that will help me. So... Are you gonna tell me where this money is? Or are we gonna keep playin' this fuckin' game? Answer me! I don't know what you're talking about! I don't have any money here! I told you, I don't deal in cash! So we gonna play like that, huh? Hm? What about you? You've been honest so far. Do you know where he's keeping the money? Just tell me. And all this is over. You can talk. Just don't scream. Now... Do you know where he's keeping the money? No. Are you sure? I'm sure. You know what? I believe you. Hell, you seem to be the only honest member of your family. You know what? Let's get you more comfortable. Let's get these shoes off. Come here. Other one. It's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get these off too. No. Please. No. Take. Them. Off. Won't be needing these. There. Isn't that better? Now... I don't have to tell you not to kick, right? Ticklish? That means you're not touched here enough. Someone's up quick. Right on time. Sit the fuck down. Sit down! Don't move. No. You move... She gets the first fuckin' bullet. No. No, no! Turn it down. I get it now. Good choice. That's some good shit. Oh. I heard your conversation earlier. That next one might not be yours either. So, you ready to say something? Or should I just put a bullet in her head? Hm? And then maybe go another round. Or maybe I should take you in there. Is that what you're waiting for? Hm? You ready to help me now? Huh? You wanna tell me where this money is? Or do you wanna continue hurting your family? I can do this all day. Don't challenge me. The bench. What? The bench. You gotta speak up louder than that. I can't hear you! The bench! At the foot of the bed. The bench? What about it? There's money in the bench. Now, you wouldn't lie to my face right now, would you? Hm? I checked that bench already. There was no money in it. Checking in the comforter. Okay. And that was in there the whole time? You killed a baby, and violated your wife before giving that up? I'm sorry! What happened? It's my emergency money. I forgot about it. Where's the rest, David? What? No, that's it! That's everything. Mm. You see... If I had have found it in the harder place, I would've thought I found your stash, but, that was too easy. What? I just told you where it was! You said if we answered you, everything would be fine. Okay. You're right. So, you will leave us alone now? I also said if he didn't answer me, bad things will happen, right? What do you mean? I gave you the money! Where's the rest? I'm telling you, there is no more! So I'm gonna ask you again. Do you know where he's keeping the money? No. Did you know your father was such a liar? Hey, I asked you a question. No. What about you? How did you become so honest? I don't know. So, um... What you and this boyfriend doin'? Hm? Nothing. You kiss him? Sometimes. You give him head? Eww. Don't lie to me. You gotta be doing something with your older man to please him. You use your hands? Some, sometimes. He, uh... He finger you? Yeah. Ain't never tried to use your mouth, huh? Maybe he tried. He used his mouth on you? Sometimes. How it feel? It's okay. I guess. He's had sex before, right? Hm? No. What the... How old is he? He's 22. I thought you said he was 20. You lying about this boyfriend of yours? No. Virgin, huh? I had a couple of virgins in my day. - Daddy, Daddy! - Sit the fuck down! Sit the fuck down! Go ahead! Stand up again! See what not listening gets you. Dad! Dad, Dad! Dad! Dad, Dad! Dad! Dad, Dad! Dad! Dad! Don't worry. I'm not taking her in there. Dad, Dad! Dad, Dad! Dad! - Dad, Dad! - Don't move. I'll blow her fuckin' brains out. Dad, Dad! And you, don't scream. No! You had the chance to talk, now shut the fuck up. Dad! Dad! Help! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Daddy, please help! Dad, help! Dad! Please, please! Help me! Dad, you have to help me! You... You lied to me. Ain't no virgin pussy. But that ass? Damn. Won't be needing this anymore. Get up. Get up. Maybe put these on. Okay? There you go. All right? Don't cry. You did good. All right? I'm sure that boyfriend of yours is really happy. Sit down. Let me clean you up. You good? There you go. You did good. If we had met in different circumstances, we could've been together. Don't cry like a child now. You're a grown lady. Okay? David. David. Now, I'm gonna give you a second, David, to think about what might happen next. And if you don't think I can't go another round then you're gonna be highly disappointed. I'm fuckin' with you, David. But if you don't start talking I'm gonna kill your girls, one by one. Don't make me do that, David. Especially that one. I like that one. A lot. Are you ready to tell me where that money is? Hm? What? You not talking to me? Hm? You really gonna kill those two girls, huh? Just kill us already. Oh. You want the easy way out. I can't give you the easy way out. Everything you have has been easy. But you're gonna make this hard for me. Fuck you, man. Fuck, it's not even your fuckin' money! I'm not the fuckin' bad guy here! You're the fuckin' bad guy. Christ. Making me do shit I don't wanna do. If you didn't wanna do it, you would've left a long time ago. That's bullshit. You don't know me. Everything I wanted, I had to take! Nothing easy! And motherfuckers like you get shit handed to 'em and wanna talk shit. You don't know me. And wanna act like money and anything else is more important than the life of your family. Fuck you, man. Fuck you, man! Fuck you! Fuck you! Dad? Is there more money in the house? Is he gonna kill us? I don't know, sweetie. I don't wanna die. I know, baby. I'm sorry. You did so well, though. You were so brave. And I'm sorry I said those things earlier. I didn't mean to... It's just... It's okay. Hey, David. You ready to talk? Hm? What do you say we let your wife rejoin the party? What do you say, beautiful? Are you gonna kill us? What? Nah, nah, nah, nah. Okay, maybe. But you can thank your father for that. Now what'd I tell you about crying, huh? Makes you look like a child. Now look at your pussy-ass dad, hm? Look at him. Even he not cryin' no more. So what do you say? Should we bring your step-mom back out here? Okay. Okay. Move next to your father. Oh, my God! What did he do to you? I'd hate to do that to my friend here, but I will. You're an animal! You watch your mouth. I'm not doin' this. You are. Now, are you gonna tell me where that money is? I'm sorry. Tell me! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You don't wanna tell me? That's fine. That's fine. David. I tried. I really tried. Unfortunately, I think I gotta cut my losses. So here's how it's gonna read. Father comes home, finds his daughter dead. OD'd on sleeping pills. Same day, he finds out that his son isn't really his. Goes mad, flips out. Beats the baby. Throws him in the incinerator. Then beats his wife. And then shoots his wife. And then shoots himself. Okay? Okay. I'm sorry, beautiful, but you can thank your father for this. At least this won't hurt. Ah, ah, ah, ah! What'd I tell you about crying? Hey, hey! Be strong. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. No, I... I'll do it. What? I'll do it. Wow. Look at this. Everyone wanna step up, except the man of the motherfuckin' house. I liked her, David. She was a keeper. But okay. Okay. No! No! No, stop! Don't! Please wait! No! Sarah. Oh. Sarah, don't sleep! Mm-mm. Sarah! Nah, she gone. Sir, sir! I'll tell you where the money is. If you get her to a hospital, I'll tell you where the money is. I don't care what you do to me. Just please get her to a hospital! Okay, where's the money then, huh? It's in the floor! The floor? In my walk-in closet, right side. Now hurry! You built a safe in your floor? Yes, please! What's the combination? There's a key in the black tea box in the kitchen cabinet! The code is 5-7-0-3! Now, please! Sarah. Baby! You better not be lying to me, David. Sarah. Please don't. My baby! This is not happening. Sweet. Sarah. Wait! You said you would get her to the hospital! Oh, I will. As soon as I get this money. She doesn't have that long! Oh, she don't? I guess you should've thought about that earlier, huh? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, let him go! Dad, Dad! Let him go! Stay there. Nicole, what the hell is goin' on? Don't move! Don't move. Fuck! You weren't supposed to have sex with her. So what? Did you like it? Of course not. She's old. Plus, she just had a baby. I did that for us. There's gotta be at least two million cash, easy. - I told you. - Mm-hm. God damn right you did. So where you wanna go, huh? Anywhere in the world. I don't know, uh, maybe Brazil? Brazil? Don't they speak Brazilian there or somethin'? Um, maybe Mexico then? In Mexico they speak Spanish. I can speak some Spanish. I used to get 90s in Spanish. Mexico it is, then. There you go. Yeah. - What're you doin'? - What? Nicki, you can't take any of the money with you, remember? Why not? It's both of ours. I gotta take it all first. Then we meet after. Well, why can't we just take the money and leave now? Because the cops'll be all over us. We don't even have our tickets yet. We won't make it out the airport. Well, what if I just take a little? Come here. Come on now. You did good. Now you have to finish your half. We got plenty of time to worry about spending money. Not right now. Save it for Mexico. Can we get married in Mexico? Of course we can. People do that all the time. Now I'm gonna go to the bathroom and get the rest of this money and we gonna get back to the plan. - All right? - Okay, babe. Nicole. Nicole, shh. What's going on? Just be quiet. It'll all be over soon. What happened? You got knocked out. No, I mean, what's happening now? Well, I'm running away. Why? Oh, now you care? What you talkin' about, Nicole? I've always cared. No, you didn't. You just wanted the money for yourself. What're you talking about? That's not true. When have you ever given me anything? I gave you everything. I gave you life. I didn't ask for you to give me life. The things I did ask for, you wouldn't give me. That's a lie. I bought you everything you have. I bought the clothes you're wearing. Only 'cause he wouldn't give me money to buy my own. You're 16! So what? I'm not a child. That's your problem. You're always treating me like a child. Because you are one. And what now? This is your 21-year-old boyfriend? He's 28. 28? How do you even meet a 28-year-old man? That's none of your business. 28 year old... That's where you've been when you were cutting classes. What is he doing hanging around a high school? You don't see anything wrong with that? How could you not tell me this? Why? So you can try and keep us apart? He raped your mom. Step-mom. And killed her. This is the guy you choose! I never wanted her here. I could never forgive you for this. Oh, but you can forgive her for making you think that Chris was yours? Watch your tongue, little girl. No! You can't threaten me anymore. I'm leaving. I'm grown and I'm my own boss now. And look you. What're you gonna do? And what, you think that grown man in there is gonna take care of you like I did? He's my fiance. He takes better care of me than you. Better than me? You are so naive. You know nothing of how a man thinks. He already got what he wanted. He got in your pants! And now he's got your family's fortune. Eventually he'll get tired of you and move on! Maybe find someone his own age, if he doesn't go to jail and rot there like he should. Along with you. See, daddy, we've been together for a long time now. And he loves me more than you ever did. You're 16. You know nothing about love. And how long could you have possibly been dating that rapist? Seven months. He's not a rapist. Seven months? And you think that's a long time. I've been taking care of you for 16 years. What will people say when they see you together? He's twice your age. The same thing they say when they saw you and Sarah. How could you be this stupid? - Babe! - What? You talking shit again? You know what? I'mma sic you. No! Are you proud of yourself? Dating a child, having sex with a kid? I'm not a kid. You leave my daughter alone. You just don't get it, do you? She's not the daughter anymore, man. She's mine. You're going to jail for a long time. Am I? For murder, kidnapping, statutory rape! I heard they love rapist in jail. Do they? Do they? What you know about jail, huh? Babe. Please, you said you wouldn't. I did. But you was right. He does know how to get under people's skin. It's okay. Okay. Are you sure you can handle this? Yes, of course. I can't believe you let this guy talk you into this. See, that's your problem. That's your problem right there. You don't give your daughter enough credit. And what is that supposed to mean? It was my plan, dad. Who's the dumb one now? What? No. See? I'm smarter than you think. What're talking about? Why would you plan to kill your brother? He wasn't my brother. - And your mother! - Not my mother! - What about me? - What about you? What did you plan to do with your father? And don't say I'm not your father. You'll see. Come on. Oh! We did it. That's right. We did. You did. I love you, babe. Love you too. Made me proud. You're a genius. Remember, all right? It ain't over just yet. Count to 100 before you do anything else. Call me when everything calm down, and I'll come back and get you. Then we're gone forever. Stay focused, though. You still got work to do. I got it. So you're just gonna let him walk out with everything this family has? Nicole! One, 1000. Two, 1000. Three, 1000. Four, 1000. Five, 1000. Six, 1000. Seven, 1000. Eight, 1000. Nine, 1000. Ten, 1000. - That's enough! - Sit down! You're seriously gonna point a gun at your father again? Put the gun down and get me out of these right now! Sit back down! Now! Listen to me, child. I'm not a child, and you listen to me. If you don't think I'll pull this trigger, Dad... So what, you gonna kill your old man? You're gonna go to jail for a long time. Nobody will be there to look after you. Nobody will even be there to visit you or write to you. It'll just be you! And much bigger, much tougher women, who have lived tough lives and didn't have their fathers, me, around to buy them everything! I'm not going to jail. Yes, you will! Unless you call the cops right now and explain to them that this guy forced you- - He didn't force me to do anything. He didn't want me to do it. He thought I could find where you hid the money, but, you don't even trust me enough to leave your bedroom door unlocked. You really thought he was a stranger and you couldn't even stand up to him for me? He could've killed me and you wouldn't have cared. All you care about is Sarah, the money, and Chris. Not me. All you ever did was talk down to me like I'm a child, and I'm done with it! That's not true, Nicole! I love you. You're my daughter! Not anymore. Come on now, Nicole, stop this! You can't tell me what to do anymore. Stop it! How do you intend on getting away with this? You helped him kill people! No. You killed the baby when you found out he wasn't yours. Then you beat her up when you found out she was hiding it from you. Then when she was unconscious, you committed suicide. When she woke up, she was so distraught that she popped a ton of sleeping pills. What? "Committed suicide?" You two have been arguing for a long time now, and then I came in and I found this gruesome scene. Nicole, stop it! Bye, Daddy. Little girl, if you don't take that- - What? What're you gonna do? You little... It's okay. You did really well. Now, are you sure there are no family members we can call? You're positive? There's nobody else. I can stay here. I'm sorry, you can't stay here. - Why not? - Well, you're a minor. We have to take you to a youth home. There's one not too far from here. You mean the group home? Yes, it's not as bad as it sounds. And it's only temporary. Well, this is my house. Why can't I stay here? Well, it's actually your father's condo and you're too young to inherit it as it stands. Don't worry, though, I will walk you in and I will come back in a couple of days to check on you. Okay? I can go by myself. I'm not a child. I'm sorry, Nicole. I have to take you in, it's policy. The police are gonna escort us, just to make sure you get there okay and sign you in. They're waiting downstairs. I have a friend that I can stay with. Can I call him? No, I'm sorry. I can't turn you over to anyone that isn't family. What about an uncle? An uncle? I thought you said you had no family to contact? I have an uncle, I just haven't seen him in a while but we speak on the phone sometimes. Well, how is he related to you? - He's my mother's brother. - Okay. Well, what's his name? Oh, whoa. Slow down. I understand you're having a rough day, rougher than most people can possibly imagine, but there are some laws and procedures that need to be followed now that you're a ward of the court. A what? Well, you're now considered a child of the state, which means that the government is your legal guardian. I don't need a guardian. I can take care of myself. I understand you're upset, Nicole, but I need to know who you would like me to call. It's my phone. Can I just make the call? I'm sorry, my organization policy states that I need to make your phone calls for you. Will you please just let me make the phone call myself? Okay, but I need to notate who you're going to call. Their name and their address. You can just write it down here and I'll let you make the call. It's busy. He might be trying to call me. "John Doe?" Okay, it's getting pretty late here. I think we need to get it going, so grab your bag- - No, no, no, no. No, he always answers. Can you just let me try one more time? Okay. Last try. But I'm gonna need a real name this time. Police, open up! We have to get going. Okay. This is it, Nicole. I need that phone now. - Wait. - Nicole. Okay, looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. I'm sorry, I know you're having an intense day but I am gonna let the officers in now and it would be in your best interest if you came without any issues. We're sorry. The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and try again. This is a recording. We're sorry. The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and try again. This is a recording. We're sorry. The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and try again. This is a recording. You gotta stop lettin' him treat you like that. Okay? All right? You're a grown woman. What do you think I should do? I'm sure I can come up with somethin'.
