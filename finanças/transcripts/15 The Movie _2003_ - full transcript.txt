25.000 "I only wanted to make a film about their lives... However in the process of filming I've reconciled with a part of myself that was forgotten" Our world is different There is no difference between right and wrong We have no family, only the brotherhood We only shed blood. Not tears In our world, we speak of camaraderie; never of love Strangely, our world only consists of darkness Yippie ya ya! Vynn Soh jumps off the building... Lands like a papaya! Sayonara! So how about it? Why do we have to represent our class to perform? Can we pull out? It's damn embarrassing! You fight like a mad dog when you are outside. In school, you're always getting public caning. What's embarrassment to you? Anyway, it's my chance to humiliate our principal. Imagine us singing in dialect and shouting vulgarities on stage! I'm sure the VIPs will fire her! Why are you doing this? She's my arch enemy! She's always giving me public caning and suspension. What do you think? Hey Vynn, I heard you took part in the Children's Karaoke Competition. I'm sure you're very experienced. Bound to set new records! What are you gonna sing? "Count on me Singapore" or do the "Great Singapore Workout"? Whatever... How about this song... Moon Sect rules from dusk to dawn We're are the brothers of Moon Sect Grab your gear We will fight with no fear Go! Go! Go! Moon Sect go! Moon Sect rules! If you dare, come nearer If you are bold, come closer We are not afraid of anyone To hell with all of you We take on your challenge anytime Moon Sect is always ready to kick your ass! Hello Melvin. I'm skipping school today. Why? I'm feeling damn moody today, school's a bore anyway. Tell Miss Lee someone in my family died. Who 'died' this time? Two weeks ago your granny died. Last week your grandpa died. How about this time? The rest of your family? You decide. Trying to be funny, are you? Hungry, hungry, damn hungry... The girl is so noisy and she looks like she is doing yoga I wonder if she is screaming in pain or pleasure I bet she's enjoying it. Great job. Free sex. She gets paid too. She's even louder than the morning rooster. So what's the most number of times you've screwed your girlfriend in a day? I've never tried Stop pretending Never done it Get serious I swear Really? Your chick has such a great body she walks like she's been doing it with you. Not even once! Out with it pal! So how many times a day? Never! Stop denying! Stop your nonsense! I'm gonna ask you one more time How many times must you ask? Are you making a pass at me? You wanna try it with me right? When we hit 18, we must get ourselves a hooker from Geylang I heard the girls there are really hot! We must make a trip there with Shaun one day. A GANGSTER'S REGRETS A SECOND TO ERR, A LIFETIME TO PAY Our friendship will be as good as it lasts. I don't think I've got any future. What do you want to do with your life? Don't think about the pain and it won't hurt. Have you ever planned for your future? I don't dare to think about my future. Eternal friends and foes do not exist. We'll split if we can't get along What do you want to do with your life? Our friendship will be as good as it lasts. One, two, three Yeah, yeah! Fury hounds are the best in Singapore With a cigarette, here we go! The band of brothers will not fall Challenge us if you dare Set a time, we'll be there! From the crimson skies to the highest Alps The brotherhood of the hounds Will be the king from underground Down a bottle of Guinness That's the greatest release Yeah, yeah! Fury Hounds We're the best in Singapore The Hounds will bash the Froggie Gang. We will screw the Froggie Gang with a bang! Freak, faggot, Froggie Gang Screw you all from the Froggie Gang $%^&*? /@#! I heard Shaun got bashed up last night Where? Serangoon Central So, what happened? He's always glaring at strangers in the teahouse. He's always like that, can't keep his eyes in the right place. How many guys whacked him? About five to six guys, I think. Five to six guys, huh? Anyway, I'm hungry, wanna grab a bite? Sure, let's go! Hey Melvin, I heard the boys want to bash us. Isn't that Shaun's gang? Yes Are you messing with their girls? Oh please, even my mum is prettier than the girls. She even won the Miss Universe pageant. Whoa! That's something... We must be careful, I don't want to get disfigured by them. I heard they're pissed that we took their territory. What can they do? We will call the police if they ever touched us. Do you think the police will believe you? You know, I've been thinking. All those trips to the police station, think I can break the Guinness Record? Don't be stupid. Where did you steal this facial masque from? 7-11, not bad huh? Yup, steal a few more packs next time. No problem. Hello... We've got trouble! LIFE'S GREATEST ENEMY... YOURSELF East Dragon! East Dragon! The ferocious boys rising from the east! Dong, dong, dong, dong... East Dragon will reign as the King We will conquer the world and make your head swirl Dong, dong, dong, dong... The wind carries our war cry The dragons are ready to take flight The dragons are ready to fly high Dong, dong, dong, dong... We are the conquerors Dong, dong, dong, dong... We are the conquerors We've had so many rehearsals Why are you adding a new Japanese segment? Do you know we're always stuck like fools at the Japanese song? Do you really think we're some J-pop stars? You're giving up without trying! And it's only our first attempt! If we can't pull it off, we'll be labeled as 'wannabes'! Ok, you're always right and I'm always wrong! Why can't you just be yourself? A cock will never become a peacock! Who are you calling a cock? Your father! Your mum's a whore in Geylang! Your dad's a gigolo in Changi. Curse your parents! Don't forget yours too! To hell with your family! Screw your mum! Screw your grandpa! Screw your entire ancestry, what are you gonna do? I'll lock you in your house, burn it down and I'll throw in a pig's head too! Your dad's a rapist! Your mum's a bitch! Your sis will be raped by the dogs! Your brother will be bashed by durians! Hell won't even accept such creatures from your family! LIFE'S GREATEST PAIN LOVE 18 umbrellas vs. Fury Hounds Attack! Brandishing our shiny blades Slashing with machetes We will fight across the island From the east to the west Why do you keep screwing up? You're the one who wanted to go on stage! The other classes are dancing to Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys! I've seen their dance steps What about us? We're not even ready! How can we go on stage next week? I shouldn't have given you so many pills. They're getting to your brains. You're becoming an idiot! I've never seen a fool like you! Mind if I borrowed $100 from you? Going to Geylang to find that big-breasted hooker? I'll be thrown out of the house soon Then throw yourself off the 18th floor That will solve all your problems. It's the latest trend! I'm not as fortunate as you. My mum never forced me to join any singing contest If I die, my soul will return to drag your whole family down to hell too Fuck, Are you a jinx? Shut that bloody mouth of yours! Nothing good ever comes out of it! Go get yourself a real tattoo, will you? Don't always ask your friends to draw it with marker pens! I hate repainting your 'tattoo' everyday! Don't you stare at me! Would it make you happy if I die? If I die, who will smoke with you? Who will sell your pills? Skip school with you? And let you copy my homework? Forcing Shaun away isn't enough for you, right? You won't be happy if I am dead! Dear god, you are the guardian of the world. You are our greatest hero, mightier than the 4 heavenly kings. If you are watching over us, then give us your blessings. We're gonna take our math test tomorrow. If I fail, I'll be homeless and probably die in the streets. I pray that we'll not get caught for cheating tomorrow. Please shower your blessing on these poor children of yours. Vynn, is your back still hurting? My life's cheap, don't think about the pain and it won't hurt. We're always fighting and getting into trouble. Have you ever thought about your future? After my 'N' levels, enroll into ITE. After I graduate, then I am off to the army. When that's over, I'll find myself a job and slog till I die If I'm lucky, I might meet my dream girl and get married. If we can't get along, we'll file for divorce. That's life, do I have a choice? That's if you don't end up in prison. Or dead. Speak for yourself! I heard that our World Trade Centre is designed by the Americans. Do you think the terrorists will bomb us too? I don't dare to think about the future. My mum's gonna drive me out of the house if I fail my math test tomorrow. I won't let you go down alone. You can copy my answers. At worst, we'll just fail together. Judging from my looks, I'll probably be too damn poor. No posh restaurant for my wedding, so a coffee shop will have to do. No wedding photo album, only neo-prints My wedding will be shoddy, but you'll still be invited. It depends if anybody wants you. You will have to take me if no one does. I'm just wondering, how long will our friendship last? If we ever lose contact, will you guys still remember me? Eternal friends and foes do not exist. Our friendship will be as good as it lasts. Easy on my back will you? Do you ever miss the times we spent with Shaun? I don't want to talk about that traitor! How did our friendship sour? I don't care who's right or wrong. I've paid my debts with the slash I suffered. Don't ever mention that name again. Fine. Remember the suicide? I've heard she killed herself cos she flunked her exams. It's actually unlucky to see such things. Shall we go to the temple? My uncle's a medium there. Don't be stupid, you might as well be a monk. You'll need an 'O' level cert to be one. I doubt you'll qualify. Just wait at home for the 'Grim Reaper' to come and claim you. Do you know it's the third suicide this week? I don't understand why it's so common now. You'll be the fourth case soon. Great. It is my chance to break another record. Vynn, why is it illegal to commit suicide? Try throwing yourself off the building. If you don't die, I'll join you the next time. I'm not staying for the rehearsal. My mum's celebrating my birthday. What's she planning to do? She's preparing a feast. What about your dad? He's dead! Vynn, can I spend the night at your place? Oh, it's nothing... My mum chased me out cos I failed my test. Thanks for putting me up. We're brothers, cut the crap. Just sleep. I came at such an ungodly hour, would your parents mind? They can't even handle their own lives, how can they interfere with mine? Whenever I'm at my friends place, I could feel their family warmth. I'm so envious of them. What do I have? When I'm at home, the only feeling I get is loneliness. Do you know what that feels like? Vynn. Can I hug you? Don't turn gay on me. It's not that. I can't sleep in an unfamiliar place. Moreover, I've a habit of hugging a bolster. Whatever, do as you please Hey, what's wrong? It was just a prank. Are you pissed that I didn't get you a bigger cake? I've got only $15 to get this small cake. It's not that. My birthday was two days ago. Moreover, the last cake I received was from my granny before she passed away. No one has remembered my birthday since then. I know you're broke... but you still got me a cake. Are you ok? This will be my last cigarette. And I don't want you to die before I do. I still need you to send me off at my funeral. "That was the last time I saw him" CONCLUDING EPISODE OF THE STRAY CAT ADVENTURES Hey! Get out of my way! Hey kid! Don't take that tone with us! Aren't you from Melvin and Vynn's gang?

Why don't you get another tattoo? You know you can't play around with tattoos? I know a guy who got a tattoo of the Goddess of Mercy and Jesus riding a bike. And you know what happened? What? He died in an accident. Why? If you put two different religious figures hugging each other, they're bound to clash. Moreover, they're gods. Just like putting two different gangs together, they're bound to fight! What happened in the end? Clash and die! I wonder what tattoo I should get next? How about the God of Justice shaving his beard? You could have God of Mercy wearing a G-string, Monkey God waxing his legs. Are you nuts?

You're a disgrace! Why do I have a son like you? I never want to see you again! Have some? No, I'm not hungry, Don't starve yourself, eat some. I feel so worthless and cheap after being humiliated by him. Being cheap isn't a bad thing, at least everyone "likes" us. We must keep our integrity despite being cheap Haven't you heard Degradation is a consolation Despair is beauty You're not alone, I'm cheap too. I have to move every time my mother gets a new boyfriend. I've lost track of how many 'fathers' I've had. Every one of my fathers has been to prison. How many "fathers" do you have? Forget it!

You can dye too... your armpit hair. How did we come home yesterday? Did you carry me? You think I'm mad? We took a cab back. Stop distracting me! Don't blame me if your haircut goes wrong. Did I say something stupid last night? Nah! You slept like a pig. Really? Shaun, can I ask you something personal? What? Do you consider yourself ugly? Why do you have so many piercings? Please! My looks can beat yours! Even if I pierced myself twenty times, I'll still look better This is art, what do you know? Who do you think you are? Even Superman dies after being hit ten times by a truck. You think you are Spiderman? Can't you see? (Point to tattoo) Aren't the needles painful? I'm used to the pain. Doesn't it hinder your eating? Of course, but you get used to it. Do you know when I drink, water drips from my piercings? Let me show you Fuck you. Want to pierce? No. Come on. No. Let's pierce. No! One last time! Do you want to pierce? Do what you want. Whatever you say. Beautiful! I'm not beautiful! I'm handsome. Here I come. Open wider. Hold on. I'm scared. Fuck! Open wider! Will I bleed?

If we're going to be brothers, Then let's be 'brothers' for life. If we die, we die together. Men's tears are precious. Don't waste it. I walk on this narrow path. In search of someone I can trust. I know that the road leads to doom. Yet I still choose this path of no return. Please do not reason me with the truth. Or expect to change me with your words of kindness. I can't offer an explanation for my life. Many say it's because of the Brotherhood. Young man, why are you always in pain? Is it because you want to play God? Why are you still so foolish? When you know this path leads nowhere. Your gang calls you brother In the name of Brotherhood, you would even risk your life. If something ever happens to you Where can your parents find their sons?
