BETWEEN TWO WORLDS Ok, I'll take a look... I need to see Mrs. Sallon. First we say hello, then we respect the line, there. Alright. What can I do? I'm here for a problem. With my codes. Ok, first and last name. Varouslakis, Steve. What do you need? I want to delete my email address from the file. I can't do that, sir. You have to do this online. What's "online"? No point standing there. You have an appointment? My advisor knows. - But you have one? - Yes. Sit down then. She'll come get you. - So it doesn't work? - No. My internet's been cut. I can't pay the bill. Mrs. Winckler. Mrs. Sallon? We need to talk. You remember me? The file... I gave you last week, with pay slips and tax sheets... Sorry, but I'm busy. You need to make an appointment. No, you'll take five minutes. I'll explain. I sent... We saw it together, I gave you the file in person. You told me: "Bring the file back with pay slips and tax sheets." I did. I got a paper in the mail, at my house, and it says I didn't bring the file back. But I did, right? What did you do with it? You need an appointment. No, no appointment. I already came once. What do I do? I'm gonna lose my rights. What do I do? Listen, I'm sure it'll work out. What do you mean "work out"? Do you have kids? - No, I don't. - Thank god. Because what can I do? I'm off welfare, I've got nothing. How do I feed my kids? I'll... I'm busy now. I don't care! I need help now! I don't have time, sorry. You'll make the time, you'll take five minutes. You're totally useless! Please, calm down. - Don't you touch me. - Calm down. - Who are you? - The agency director. Calm down. - No! - Yes, you will. - You're all useless. - Calm down. - I won't. - I'll take care of your file. - I'll deal with it personally. - Useless. The first thing I see is that since law school you haven't... done much. What happened during... these 23 years? What happened... I was married, a housewife... then my husband left me. I have to start all over. You've never done a résumé workshop? - No. - You can. It could be a good thing. So first, an employer asks you why you're applying. What do you tell him? I tell him I'm unemployed. Not the right answer. You're right, no point saying that. - Ok. - Everyone's unemployed. You need to talk about the company. That's very important. You have to sell yourself. You need to say: I can work anytime, even Sundays. Show you're determined. What are your qualities? - Energetic? - Yes, energetic. Enterprising, cheerful, team-spirited? Oh yes, yes. What seems possible to me, considering your profile, for your personalised employment project, is to aim for maintenance agent. That's a cleaning lady, right? I thought we said cleaning technician. We did, now we don't. Those jobs are the future. Always needed, can't be delocalised... I'll take it! You'll take it... First they have to take you. Neat appearance, punctual. Team spirit. Minimum wage is 7.96 euros per hour, after taxes. Somewhere, someone said 6.84 wasn't enough, nobody could live with that. But that 8.46 was too much. Can't take it that far. I don't make that much. Now I don't make anything. I scrape by on a bit of savings. Take out 350 euros for rent plus deposit. About the same for food. Add transportation, heating. The phone, internet... I gave up on clothes and fun. How long before I make minimum wage? How long before I get a stable job? Do you mind? Go for it, same for questions. Thanks. Why cleaning? It's my passion. It's always been my passion... For things to be clean, orderly. I like it. Main quality and main flaw? Quality... Energetic! Cheerful, also. I've got team spirit. Alright. What about your flaws? You don't have any? Well, maybe I'm a little too... Perfectionist? - And... - Yes? Well... I've got ambition. Ambition? Alright. If I'm in cleaning, I want to work for a leader in the field. And this is a leading company. Indeed it is. You know this job means working very late or early. Often on sites far away. Are you mobile? Licence, a car? Yes, I've got my licence. But no car. No car? How will you get on site at 6am? I'll manage. That's my problem, but I'll be there. Do you have other hours? Not yet, no. It's normal to look. What matters is doing your hours and punctuality. I'm fair, but it goes both ways. - Deal? - Yes, deal. Ok, listen. We may contact you. I say "may". I suggest you answer, we can't chase after applicants. How many did you give? How many what? How many résumés? Six. I gave five. I'm picky. Photocopies aren't cheap. Cédric. Marianne. Can I see yours? Yeah... Here's mine. If you wanna look. 20 empty years. Not easy. I'm aware... thanks. Yours has holes too. Ambiance agent for green spaces? What is that exactly? Bit of a joke. It adds a line. - Sounds eco-friendly. - Sure! I'm going for a smoke. Coming? Why not. Want one? I quit three years ago. - You don't miss it? - Not at all. I'd miss it. When they ask you for your main qualities and flaws... What do you say? Main quality: I'm honest. Main flaw... I'm honest. You? For me, honesty... I don't know. I lie sometimes. But usually I say it when I lie. I mean I end up saying it. If you say it, it's not lying. Any plans for lunch? Well I... I thought I'd... grab a sandwich. What kind of sandwich? I don't know... Tuna... Tuna salad? Don't know what they put inside. I live next door. I've got a pizza. You're invited if you want. It's a fancy pizza! Do you have a car? Don't even ask... - You don't? - Worse. I had one. A Clio Baccara. White, leather seats, the whole thing. Know what happened? Insurance sticker expired, I got towed. They asked for 250 euros. I didn't have it, so they kept the car. - Then what? - Then nothing. Nothing to do. They keep it. I'll never have one like that. How much was it worth? At least 1,500, maybe 2,000. But you can't... I'm not saying 250 isn't a lot but... You couldn't have asked around? Family, friends... 50 euros here, 30 there. Lucky you if you've got rich friends. I don't. Got a boyfriend? Yes. I mean... Yeah I... What will you say about lunch? I'll tell him I had lunch with you. I mean, he's got nothing to worry about. Says you. A man with such a pretty girl always worries. That's sweet. I've got your number. Mind if I call you? No... Why not? I hope Cédric calls. I'd like someone to call. I don't know anyone in Caen yet. I stick to the rule, no contact with my life in Paris. No phone, no email, no Skype. Nobody knows where I am. Off the grid. Hello. At times it's incredibly exciting. This feeling of not existing for anyone. Being no one. But there are moments when... I'm pretty lost. Hi, Mom. Yeah, I'm already there. No, I didn't touch the thermostat. Left it at 16. It's freezing at 16. It's not a lot. I do wear layers! Of course you blame it on Jimmy. You're pissing me off. Love ya. What you need to know is that cleaning is a fine job. A job with advancement opportunities. If you want it, that is. I was a maintenance agent myself. I climbed the ladder to manager. Now I share my knowledge as a trainer. You'll face difficulties, working in the cleaning industry. Because you'll greet folks who maybe won't say hello back. If that happens, what do you do? - Nothing? - We can do a bit better than nothing. Think about it. Guy doesn't say hello, what do you do? We say it again? We say it again! - What's your name? - Marilou. So, Marilou. And the others. I want more. Think. What else do we do? We smile? Don't push it... What's that mean? We say hello and we smile! That's not pushing it. Meet and greet! What is it? Anybody know meet and greet? Take out your notebooks and pens. Write this down. Meet and greet. Smile, say hello, goodbye, and thank you. Meet and greet. No cheating. Don't forget that. We call it the beast because it can be scary at first. Hello. Hello. Hello! Smile! As I was saying, this is a floor scrubber. We call it the beast but it's harmless. Since you just joined us, you get to start. No need, I know how. Why are you here then? Like everybody. Can't lose welfare. Right. Ok... I'll pick someone at random. I'll start the beast, then go over to someone who'll take it from there. At random: Marianne. Just focus, and don't do anything crazy. There's a first time for everything. My first time I ran over the trainer. Let's go, Marianne! Press the underside button, then that one, and go, right then straight. Come on, let's go. Good. Keep it straight. Now make a wide circle. Slowly, slowly. It's ok, doesn't matter, go forward. Let's go, let's go. I don't know how to stop it! Help me. Let go, let go. Good. It's ok. - Good. - She tamed it. Nailed it. Can you get me the sponge cloths? - Marilou? - Yes. - Seen the time? - Sorry, I'm late. Ok, thanks. Alright, let's speed up. Grab the brooms on the way. Put this on. - Thanks, put this on. - Thanks. - Take off your coats. - Yes, sure. - Does it fit? - One size fits all. Great. Here, your bags. Please ladies, let's hurry. Glad they hired you. Let's go. We start with the hard part. And that is? - The toilets. - That's right. Marilou, bring the cart please. We'll find one that needs a good bit of work. This one. You go, Marianne. Sure. You start? Show me. So, I start with... - Do you know or not? - Not. - You don't know? - I've never done public ones. - At home... - We start with gloves. Grab the gel cleaner, toilet brush, sponge cloth. Pink! Colour code! Start with the gel cleaner. Brush. Quickly, we don't have all day. And finish with the sponge cloth. Got it? Yes. - Sure? - Yes. You'll be alright? - Close it? - No, no. Of course. Come on, let's hurry. Marilou! Do you have something for my hair? A hairband, anything? - I forgot. - You're in luck. Great, thanks. If I smoked, I'd have one now. The fleece jacket, not a great idea. Too hot... What is it? You think I suck, right? That's not it. It reminds me of last summer. I worked at Youpi-Metal. It was so hot inside, you couldn't breathe. I ended up cleaning in undies. Next day, I get called into the boss's office. He showed me the security tape. And fired me! Youpi-Metal Undies 50 euros compensation Studying your notes? Had Marilou asked to see my notes... What would have I said? What then? You're good at that. Thanks. There's two ways to do windows. The French way, in lines. And the American way. In circles, like this. I like that best. Why are you taking this class? You know everything. For the degree. The degree... Hello. Only here? There's 30 more. - How's it going here? - Not too bad. Seen those splash marks? That's how you clean a microwave? Come and see this! - Not done. - Yes, it is. Are you kidding me? Look at this, it's not done. It's not brand new, it's been used. It's not like it's fresh out the box. You think it's funny? You won't laugh when I check the loo. Hurry up. Don't forget anything. Mr. Mathieu... Here, put this in the trash. I just saw the managers. They're not happy. You were rude. We could lose the job. We weren't rude. I don't want to hear it. The job gets done, period. That's nonsense! - Sorry? - The work was done. - Not according to them. - Sorry, but it was. We only had 3 hours. You don't get the picture. I made a deal, it has to be honoured. It's not my fault your team is slow. You finish the job. That's hypocrisy! Hypocrisy? Do you hear yourself? I'm the boss, don't tell me how to act. Ok? If that's how you take it, you can hand in your smock. How did I end up with these nitwits! Hey there! You're ok, honey? This is Marianne. Hello. Pleasure. She just got canned. That was quick! - Coffee? - Sure, thanks. I'll take one too. Guess because of who? The two witches, obviously. They told Mr. Mathieu we worked like pigs. And he called us "nitwits". That's it? Every time you do a job with them you come back mad as hell and crying. I keep telling her to quit. Can't do that, hon. We can't afford it. It's still 12 hours a week. And you were fired. Yep... - Got other hours? - No. Shit. Have you been in Caen long? About a month. - Where were you before? - Châteauroux. Châteauroux... Why'd you leave? Think the weather's nicer here? I mean, you don't have to answer... No, I don't mind. It's common and sad. Really? My husband had a... a garage in Châteauroux. Still does actually. I did the accounting. Then one day, he moved the neighbour in. What could I do? Yeah, of course. I couldn't just stay. Couldn't move next door either. And see her every day at the bakery. Sure, I get it. I didn't have much choice. I really had a sheltered life. I didn't realize. That there were no real jobs left. With monthly pay, insurance, paid vacations. Got a licence? Yeah, I do, but... - But no car? - Right. You wouldn't be as bad off with one. Sylvie? Of course! I call it the tractor. See why? Oh yeah. It won't help global warming. - How much for it? - Nothing, it's worthless. You're a friend? You can borrow it. But you take care of the vehicle inspection. Thank you. Now that I have a car, I think it'll change things. I could have access to other jobs. Right? Care to explain why you're here? What do you want? Why are you chasing after cleaning jobs? I read your last book. I hadn't when we met, but your face was familiar. I'm sick of hearing about the crisis. Unemployment, poverty, like it's not real. "Insecure employment." I need to know what's going on. For real. For real? Yes. 12% of unstable jobs means nothing to me. I need to know, to live it daily. See what's really there. I want to make the invisible visible. To write a book? Write a book, yes. It's my job. When you're sick of it, you'll stop? Go back to your real life. The people who come here can't stop when they're bored. Big difference, isn't it? Yes, it's a big difference. But... I'm not faking it. I'm elbow deep in shit. I believe you. I can't tell if this is right or wrong. No doubts yourself? Ever? Sure, sometimes. But what I want to tell is stronger. You don't mind taking a job someone really needs? No, because I swore I'd stop the day I got a full contract. So if I offer you one, here and now, you're in trouble. Sure. But you won't? Please? - You're the temp? - Yes. Hope you're better than the last one. We got rid of her. Don't change the bin bags every time. They're super pricy. I was told to. Should I put it back? No, it's done now. I spend my time driving mindlessly, my head bursting with weird combinations of hours, routes, instructions. Remember to cut the alarm on this site. Take the express way for that one. Keys back in their hiding spot. Don't forget the cafeteria trash. Oh, will you just chill! Go on, move forward. You should put cream on. I'm becoming a man. - Do you use cream? - Yeah, but not tonight. What about yours? Mine's here, see? It hurts. I'll finish here and here, then I'm all set. - Can I touch? - Sure. That's no fake, that's for sure. I had one in the army. Look! She's shedding! Cause I worked on it. Want another? I've got an idea, but for now... I'm out of cash. - How much is it? - Loads! Tattoos like this... at least 150 euros. So it's a cost. I put my kids first. Good for you. Fill the fridge, get clothes... When one's not asking for Pokémon cards, the other wants a switch game or something. Maybe I'll get lucky. Meet a loaded guy who goes: "Whatever you want, baby!" Then I'd get shoes, tattoos... Chill. But better be realistic. It won't happen. You ever worked with Christèle? No, I met her tonight. And the lottery? What then? The usual, I'd spread it around. Some for my mum. Then yeah, I'd spoil myself. 300-buck sneakers and a tattoo. - What if... - And what about you? - You'd leave your register? - No way. No, I wouldn't leave. I love my customers. They're good to me. I'd stay. I'd travel, but I'd keep on working. I'd get my license. Right on, Marilou. Marianne? What about you? - What about me? - Winning the lottery. See that? Jinx. Pass. You can't do that! No really, no idea at all. She's weird, for real. That was fun. - I got a surprise. - What? - You'll see. - Tell me. - Hold on. - Just tell me! You'll see for yourself... Look! The magic box. Beer or mojito? Mojito! Done. Alright, cheers! To bowling! Cheers! Don't cross, it's a jinx. Great mojito. Homemade! You can tell. You can tell it's homemade! One drink and you're out? You don't care if the bar sees? We're not paying for their beer! - True. - We paid to bowl. - It adds up. - Yeah, we're not Jeff Bezos. It's dumb, I botched my career. What did you want to do? Have my own company. What kind? I don't like to talk about it. You won't make fun of me? Course not. Cédric, I won't make fun of you. Hey you two, refill? I had a plan... A crazy plan. But it was too big for me. I wanted a pizza truck. But, hey... No fries, no hot dogs. Pizza! Of course! Your specialty! Of course! If you start on that... I wanted to teach history. Yeah, I know, yeah. It happens, don't be sad. - Course not. - There you go! - If I'm sad, you'll cheer me up? - Sure I will! Cheers. You don't always get what you want, right? Cheers. You come here often? Not often. Not enough cash. What do you do? I'm in cleaning. Me too! The Ouistreham ferry. I heard it's hell. Worse than oysters. There's no such thing. Did three months, broke my back. Listen, I do three shifts a day. 6am to 11.30pm. You're home one sec, then you have to go back. No buses at that time. So, it's one hour in the morning and one at night. So how do you... get there, to Ouistreham? On foot. Ridesharing exists, doesn't it? Where do you live? In Blainville. That's super far. Yeah, but you do it. I can take you if you want. You're Mother Theresa? No. I just have a car, I can take you. But I need more hours, so you get me hired. Because Marilou said it was hell? Word is they come from Sudan. And we complain? Imagine being born there. Why are they up so early? The cops shake them down at 5.30am. They take their blankets and shoes. Hi! I brought my friend. What's her name? Marianne. - Ok, Marianne. Wanna work? - Yes. Done this before? - Yes... - Cleaning? - Yes. - You know how it goes? Yeah. Stopover is an hour and a half, not a second more. Minimum wage. - Good for you? - Yes. But it's tough. You got to hurry. I can tell you, it's hell. That's how it goes. The ferry is a commando op. Christèle, you take her with you. Show her the ropes. - Sure. - Take Justine too. Justine, you there? You go with them and show Marianne how it's done. No trial period, you cut it or not. - We're good? - Yeah. Let's go, the bus is waiting but the ferry won't. By the way, you can't miss a day or show up late. Ok. - First time? - Yeah. Don't worry, it'll be fine. I'm a bit worried. Nadège said we're doing cabins. I'll show you. You've got the bunks and bathrooms. So it'll be one or the other. But men don't do bathrooms. Why not? Nope. Nope, why? That's how it is, it's the rules. They can't cut it? They're too fragile. Kevin? - See yourself doing the bathrooms? - With you, anything. Now if you want. - Ok. - Yeah? Done. He won't do it. Cleaning crew! Cleaning crew! Marianne, take a look. You're lucky, it's clean-ish. Some people are pigs. Take everything off, put it outside. The cart picks them up. Take a sheet. Usually tall girls do the top bunks. But in a crunch, you do both. For the duvets, there's a trick. You'll catch on as it goes. You good? Can I leave you? Yeah, thanks. - I'll leave her with you. - Ok. - Good luck. - Thanks. Hurry up, faster! You gotta speed it up. We have 230 rooms to do. Four minutes per room. Speed's the word. Otherwise we won't make it. That's it? Seriously. Do the corners again. No wrinkles in the sheets. Can't be sloppy. If Nadège sees that, you'll do it again. Ok, let's go. Let's move it! Damn it! What happened? My phone. Shit. What, it's funny? Sort of, yeah. Not to me, it's dead. If you were in Sudan... no water, no phone, no problem! - All good, Kevin? - Yeah, you? - You like the vacuum? - All night long, warrior-like. Right? That you are. Come on, hurry. We have the other side. Let's go. What're you doing? This isn't the way. It's nice to take a detour. See those two trees? They look like they're talking. Beautiful, isn't it? I am incapacitated. What's that mean? Incapacitated. It means... Dead tired. Almost like... dead drunk. Or trashed. Incapacitated. I don't have the time. I never do this. I'm here three times a day, to go to work. Don't have time for what? To just look at the sea. We're taking the time. Yeah... Come on, let's swim. You're serious? You go, I'll watch. Come on. Nah. Go, go, go. Freaking crazy. - Thanks. - Can I have a coffee? To warm up. Can you tell their head from their ass? No, but they can. They're always fucking. Really? Thanks. All warmed up? I'm ok, thank you. Give me your phone. They say rice absorbs water. Let's see if it works. You're crazy though. I felt like it. You always do what you feel like? Not always. When I can. But I'm alone. Nothing to lose, that helps. You don't have kids? - Can I have one after? - Yeah. Hold on, finish your smoke. It's alright, only takes two seconds. You're from Caen? No, I actually came because I don't know anyone. I take what happens... as it comes. Not sure where it'll lead. Not far, apart from the cemetery. Here you go. That's good. Three years since I quit. I'll hate myself for it... but I wanted to. See, it works. That's crazy. I'd never have believed it. See I can do crazy too. Really, I can't believe it. They're always fucking... That's it, I've got it. I've got the book. That's how it goes. You try, you stumble, you scribble notes here and there. It makes no sense. Feels like you'll never make it. Then, at some point, something happens. Something, or rather someone. You thought it would be a group portrait. Nothing wrong with that, but suddenly, someone breaks off from the group. And you realize the book is her portrait. You're dating Cédric? Is it a question? It is. Yes or no? Am I dating Cédric? Yeah, Cédric. Well no. And... no? No, why? Dunno, he seems to like you. He's hitting on me. It's nice, right? Yeah, it's nice. But I'm not dating Cédric. - You've got a boyfriend then. - No. So why not be with Cédric? What's wrong with Cédric? Am I grilling you? No way? You don't want to? No, I live alone these days. I'm fine like that. - No boyfriend, nothing? - No, you? No way. I'd rather be alone than in bad company. When was your last guy? Around Methuselah. When's that? A long time. So what, two years, one year? I dunno. Come on, tell me! I don't know. You don't want to say? Like, one-night stand stuff! Some mind you got. - A dirty mind? - Christèle! We only live once. - Can you check the right? Thanks. - No one, you're good. I always made my bed when I got up. All my life. I'm not afraid of making beds. But I never made 60 beds in an hour and a half. One minute and half each. Top bunk, bottom bunk... It numbs your back and shoulders. When you get home, your arms are shaking. When you sleep, they shake. Electric jolts freeze up your muscles and wake you. I like doing public bathrooms better. Or mopping. It's dirtier, but less exhausting. Choices like this show you the ferry old-timers. - Shit. - What's up with you? You're all thumbs. How did you clean back home? I didn't clean back home. My husband was rich, we had a maid. For real? You had a maid? Yeah. How much did you pay your maid? 13 euros, I think. How many hours did she clean? Three hours. Three or four hours. With employment cheques. Oh yeah, those. And what did she do? She took care of the house... She did the laundry, she cleaned the kitchen. She cleaned the oven, stuff I didn't have time to do. You ever cleaned people's houses? Only private house I do is my mum's. Your mother? The rest I won't do. What would you do while she cleaned your house? The accounting, the shopping. I took care of my husband. Some people are just lucky. Yeah, well... My husband could afford it, so I took advantage of it, I guess. It's pretty cool, you know. - What? - Having a friend who had a cleaning lady, all paid for. I think it's cool. Yeah, it was what it was. I'll tell you, it's weird being in cleaning for me now. No shit. Now you're getting your hands dirty. I get that, you're not used to it. I'm not used to it, but I've adapted somewhat. I suck, but I'm better than when I started, right? - Yeah, but... - You're hard on me. - I try hard. - I can see why now! Wait, I'll help. The water's coming. I can't do it. Do what? I tried to make this one but... It collapsed. - Wait, I'll help you. - There, look. Come on, just once in a while. It'll be the only time this year. - A quick swim. - No, dream on. You go. Come on. Kids, you want to swim with me? - You ok? - Yeah. How much is it? So I can count. It's 47.38. Give me a sec. 23... 23 euros 69 cents. I'll give you 24, it's easier. No, give me 23. - Let's not haggle. Here, 24. - No, 23. I checked, she didn't take any money. I felt better. So why go through my bag? What was she looking for? Does she suspect something? Does she suspect that those gas tanks we split to the cent, are a lot more expensive for her? Seems like everyone who's struggling around here ends up on the ferry. You get fired from a meatpacking line, like Marilou, there's the ferry. Waiting for you, with its three shifts, its hellish rhythm and long hours. But in the end, there's a nice vibe. - Yeah, a lot. - Chill. It's tough, like all jobs, but we'll help you and it'll be fine. Chill. Your hands are just sore after. It'll be fine. Coming up for coffee? I'm too tired now. Come on, one coffee. For you. There you go. Kiddos, say hi to Marianne. Ok. Hello. Come on, Kalel. Put the game down and go to your rooms. One sec, I'll make coffee. - I'll help you. - It's just a coffee. How did you know? How? Mum looked in your wallet and took your ID card. Right! Then she put it back in your bag real quick, so you didn't see it. - How do I do this? - Make a wish. Make a wish in your head, not out loud. Otherwise it won't come true. Then I'll say nothing. What do I wish? You decide, it's your birthday. Say it in there. The four of us. One, two, three. Here. You don't have to say thank you, it's your birthday. Thank you. You'll like it. It's simple, like you. How sweet. Look how pretty it is! Mum, what is it? I know. It's me who bought it. Because Mum didn't know what to get. Lucky I was here! It's a four leaf... Clover! It's a lucky charm. You can never take it off! For the rest of my life then. Thank you. Please don't say "you shouldn't have". I almost talked then, spilled everything. Instead, I thought up something sentimental. But sometimes sentimental things are more real. This necklace and its clover, I'll wear it every day, for the rest of my life. They'll bury me with it. Couldn't have done it without you. Don't worry about it. You work again today? Not before 4pm. We could go for a walk. Yeah. Why not. - Where do you want to go? - The supermarket. - You've got errands to run? - Not really. Just to hang out, you know. Yeah. Great, ok! Can I drive? You don't mind? - Go for it. - Thanks! You know I used to teach driver's ed? - Really? - Yeah. You know the first thing we teach students? - No? - GTH. GTH? G.T.H. Gears. Turn signals. Handbrake. GTH! Picture it. You see a woman you like. You follow her quietly, not creepy though, right! And when she picks something from the shelf, you reach out and pick the same thing. Go ahead. - What? - Pick anything. - What? - Whatever you want! There, I see you. Breaks the ice, starts the conversation. Thank you, sorry. See? What a lady's man! I'm just looking for love. Noticed we do couple stuff, you and I? Couple stuff? Yeah. Bowling, fixing the car, the supermarket... I like it. Don't you? This might be for a job, sorry. Sure I'll miss you, love! Hi. Hi, girls. Who'll marry this year? - You! - Might need a guy first. That can be arranged! Here, girls. Thanks. I'll miss you all. I had amazing moments with you. Lots of great memories. But this opportunity at Brioche Dorée was more than I could hope for, so I've got to leave. But I promise I'll visit. So don't forget me. I won't, anyway. Hope to see you real soon. We hope so too. Cheers, thanks for coming. Cheers! To beauty! To Justine! To Justine! To your future! To you guys! And good luck! I wanted to say... Girls like you, I'd like to see that all the time. Every day. You're a really fabulous girl. We're usually invisible to passengers. But they sure see you! They see only you, bombshell! It's no secret. You remember the guy who wouldn't leave the ferry? Because he had a crush on you something fierce. I wish you good luck. That's so sweet. - You deserve the best. - I'll miss you. Stop, I'll cry. No need, it's all good fun. You'll drop by? Of course I will, sure. Don't become too cool for us. You know me! I have a surprise, don't laugh. A surprise? It's a vodka party tonight, on Ouistreham's wharf, head's in the sky, with Faycal we get down, we clean with the team all night. Justine, you motivate me, your beauty inspires me, from you we have great memories. Great, thanks! Thanks, I love it. Just something I wrote on the way. Thank you. Another! Another! - Where's it from? - I wrote it. I swear. - I wrote the music as well. - Keep going, kid. Appreciate it. It's Justine, she inspired me. - She's an inspiring one. - It's all on her. I want one when I retire. I'll wear a corset. Won't be the same. Why's that? I got a big bosom! - Mighty big! - I've got potential! Yeah, but not the same kind! - Don't be jealous. - Share the spotlight! Go check the shitter, might need a scrub. Justine really lucked out. You won't spend your life on the ferry. I sure hope not. I hope I'll leave with Jimmy. Far away. To each their own dreams, right? - Where? - Don't know yet. Just leave. I want to escape, forget. You showing off? You'll leave too. At my age, I'll die here. Between us, you'll die here too. - So I'm done? - Pretty much. Nadège's doing the statue! She's doing it, I swear! Look girls, she's doing the statue again. It's mental! Can't shake her. Do the gorilla! You know, Faycal. - Hey! - I'll help you, I feel bad for you. I'm struggling here. Nadège! Wakey wakey! Rise and shine! Nadège. You hear me, Nadège? Show's over, let's go. Go on, get to work! Look, look! She dances like a goddess. Cleaning crew! Wow, it's swaying! I feel it. - But we're docked! - I know that. Damn I've got hot flushes, it's no joke. There's something I'll never get. People who puke and shit, and then don't flush. What do you think? Makes sense. It's to piss us off. What would it cost them to flush? Damn. - What? Clean linens on the dirty pile? - Ok, chill. Do it right. You know how. Hey! What are you up to? - Thinking. - You drank, deal with it. I know, I'm going. Always pissed that one, I swear. - Still here? Move! - Almost done. It's my spot, move. - We're done! - Not yet! Move, there's no time. Passengers are here. Come on move it, faster. Shit, my coat! - Where is it? - Dunno, a cabin. Let's get it. Smart move. - Where you going? - One sec! What are you doing? - Getting off! - Boat's leaving! - Where is it? - In the back! Got it, let's go! - Shit. - Forget it, we'll go through the hold. Fuck, we'll get kicked out. No, we won't. Boat's gone, nobody's coming. If they come in, we're screwed. This is first class. No one will bother us. Champagne! I guess we're staying. Whisky. Here, take this. - Marilou! - I drank too much, I think I'm done. You don't have to drink booze. Just something for Justine. We'll drink to her. That's life. I'll have champagne. Ok, then me too. Just a drop. If one hour ago, someone said: "You're staying on board and missing the departure!" We'd have freaked out. Thanks. - We're in trouble already. - Bit more bit less, who cares! We're screwed anyway. Worse case what? We get fired? Well, that's life. At least we enjoyed it. To Justine! Again! Not too loud though. Don't sweat it, it's fine! Chill, guys. It's mental! Justine is so pretty! - I know right! - Yeah. You know she's a boy? Yeah, Justine's a boy. Don't say that. Justine was born intersex. Meaning: no gender for the baby. The doctors decided she was a boy. But Justine's a woman. You're kidding me? Why would we? My brother knew her in school. And Justine, she's super ok with it. That's true. She's fine with it. So, you shouldn't say she's a boy. Macaroons, champagne. Fancy stuff. What else? When Nadège realises we're not there... She's gonna freak. We should be quieter. - Nadège's not here. - They're not listening behind doors. So we're fine. Open bar. - Damn, what a pig! - Holy fuck! Anyone want water? - Someone does. - She's thirsty. That's nice. - What if we didn't go back? - How so? We go to Portsmouth and we don't come back to Ouistreham. We stay in England. - What do we do in England? - Adventure! Adventure, I'm in. Got my vote. You too? Of course you're in, you swim in -40°. You're alone. I've got the kids, she's got Jimmy, and we're broke. We rob a bank. - Seriously? - Sure! No, I don't know. It'd be cool to do something dangerous, forbidden... - This isn't enough? - Not enough adrenaline. Sideways! Come on. Come on girls. Closer. Here. One more. One more. Look at your face! I've got better. Go on, keep going. I think she's filming us. Go on. The light's on. Keep going. You know what? Today's April 4th. And every April 4th, I say we meet up. - Without the guys. - Of course. We meet up here. On the ferry. We come alone, like we don't know each other, and spend the night here, in first class. Deal? - And you're paying. - I am! I mean... I've got some savings and... We listen to music... we dance, we talk about our lives. Talking about our lives... If you want to, sure, but I won't. Why not? You don't have to tell everything. What is it? I'd like to... I'd love for us to stay friends. To never lose each other. You understand? This time it's my vote. You're too much. Come on, let's smoke. You two go. I'll stay and rest. - You're coming. - I don't smoke! No, you're coming. I'm tired. You're a pain. Marianne? Marianne. What are you doing here? Going to England? How dumb, of course you are. You're ok? Charline, Marianne. We already met. Russian New Year at Gregoire's place. Evening, Louis-Do. Christèle. - We're going. - I heard, your father. We were in New York. You know I loved him. You took the ferry before? It's nicer than the train. Sorry, we have to go. Have a beer with us. - No, because... - Or anything, but it's mostly beer. No, we're going. Where? We have to. Hold on. You've been gone a while. Is it true you're writing a book about cleaning ladies? What's your friend saying? You're writing a book about cleaning ladies? Care to explain? Yeah, come on. I'll explain. Come on. I think you messed up big time. All ears. Go on, I'm listening. Here you go. I'm a writer. A writer? I'm a writer. I write books. I'm writing about unemployment, poverty, the crisis. I wanted to understand from the inside. How you have to struggle to get hours. I wanted to understand what you live. I wanted to live it too. With you. - Christèle. - Don't touch me. - Can I have one? - No, you can't. I'm doing this so that people understand what it's like. - So they understand? - Yes. Great! Should I thank you now? Who are you really? Where do you live? How much do you really make? Tell me, how much? The husband who dumped you, is that true? Know what you are? You're a fake person. You're nothing. You're less than me, a cleaning lady. You're worse. You're humiliating. You've humiliated everyone. Pretending to be what you aren't. Your tears, what are they for? Fake, like everything else. But our friendship is real. Get lost. You heard me? Get lost. Piss off! You're useless, just piss off. You're fake! Go on, get lost. When you lent me your car, to take my son to that birthday party. That was nice. The kid's father works in oysters. I was the only guy, talking with the kids' moms. They asked me what I did, so I said: "I've got a company." They asked: "What company?" I felt like an ass, so I talked about the pizza truck. Do you think I screwed up, saying that? Did I screw up? Did I? No, you didn't screw up. Good. Because the kid's mom, the oyster guy's wife, she's giving me a chance. I'm summing up so you get it. I'm happy for you. You're happy for me? You don't get it then. We're having an affair. Now we can't see each other as much. You're not mad? Not sad? Yes, I'm sad. I wanted to thank you. Thank you, Michèle and Richard Tourlaville. Thank you, Cédric Marcienne. Thank you, Alicia Alonso. Thank you, Justine Leroy. Thank you, Lucie Sallon. The only one who caught me, who could have messed it all up, but who covered for me. Thank you, Nadège Porteur. I see you back there. Hiding back there. Can I say something? Marianne. A big thank you. For being on my team. When you came to tell me you were a writer, I swear... I fell from my chair. You're a real rascal. It's crazy. Thank you, because what you wrote is the truth. And I think people who take the ferry now, won't see things the same. At least I hope so. We'll get more respect. That matters. So thank you, really. Between Two Worlds To Joseph Wishing you a pleasant read - Thank you very much. - Thanks. - Hey, Nitwit! - How are you? I brought three. You should have told me. I'd have given them to you. You kidding? With all I bought, you'd be broke. Everyone's getting it. The first one is for Patricia. You don't know her. She's like a sister to me. Thanks. Hold on. Sorry, I'll be back. Marilou! I'm glad you're here! The tractor? You've got your licence! Yes. We're going for dinner. You coming? It's full of people you know. There's Michèle, Nadège, Justine. Come. I came for Christèle. She wants to see you. She does? I want to see her too. When can I? My train's tomorrow. She'll see you now. In Ouistreham. I can't do that, not now. I can't go to Ouistreham. If not, you won't see her again. Your call. Hi, Christèle. Hi. Want one? Did you quit again? You're fancy. I'm happy you're still wearing it. Did you get my book? Yes. I thought maybe you'd moved because... Nope. Still here, as you can see. You read it? I did. Can't blame you. You did your job. Coming with us? Hour and a half, then we bring you back to your friends. We wonder if you can still scrub a shitter. No! It makes no sense. - It'd be... - What? Nonsense. Christèle, you know that. Yeah, you're right. Everyone in their place. Marilou! Christèle! Marilou! Please don't say "see you soon". Subtitles: Jean Carrere
