Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Did you get everything you need? I saw you shooting me, Stalker. OK. OK, yeah you caught me. So I'm... Tessa. From Echo Park. Look, I assumed shooting you was OK since you were late and I, I was just bored. Aren't you supposed to offer me a drink or something? Right. Hey, yo, Stace. What do you want? Uh, Red-eye large. What's up, Nicky? Can we get two large Red-eyes... in uh... Sure thing. Yeah. In to-go cups. So does photographing unsuspecting girls constitute art for you? It's a little creepy. Creepy? Yeah. Creepy. Let me show you something. Can I invade your space for a sec? Invade away. Do me a favor. Hold this knob and turn it so it gets really close to your eyes. Alright, you see that? Yeah. You got my scar. You got a scar. Where? Me too. But, uh, that's not what I'm talking about. Look again. What am I looking at? How crystal clear the focus is. Yes, it's very crystal. Yeah, see... A regular person wouldn't just hold that pose for so long. Kind of feels... unnatural. Usually when I shoot candid shots, the subject would be moving One inch this way, one inch the other. You lose the focus. I lose the shot. OK. You know what this feels like? No. Educate me. It almost feels like you stood still because you knew I was there. Like... maybe you liked it. Here y'all. Two large Red-eyes to go. Oh, thank you so much. Keep the change, alright? You want to go for a smoke and a walk? I'm good with sitting. What? You don't like walking? Not really. Makes me feel closer to home. Are you trying to take me on an adventure? Yeah. Yeah You ever hear of those, uh, 7-Eleven adventures? No. It's pretty wild. All the cool kids are doing it. You in? Can I ask you a personal question? Sure. So your pictures are very good. What the fuck are you doing photographing shitty fucking SoundCloud rappers? This way. They were respected musicians from East Los Angeles thank you very much. And to answer your question... They paid me in pills. You like pills? I like the occasional trip to Mars and back. That's interesting. Could be an adventure. Yeah, maybe. OK, this is me. OK. No, I live here. Yeah, no I gathered, weirdo. Do you need me to order you like a ride or something? No. I'll keep doing the Chicago thing. Hey, Nicky. Yeah? I did know you were watching. You were right. Right about what? I liked it. Hey, Ma. Yeah, no, I'm on my way to a shoot right now. I can't really talk, alright? Yeah no, the money's good. It's a good shoot. I got to pull up. Tell... Yeah, tell Pop I said hi, alright? OK. Hey, I love you ma. Bye. Fuck. It's too soft. Come on, Nicky. You piece of shit. That's not bad. Hey, fuck face. Hey, man. So, what's this big fucking news? I got you a job, and the pay is really great. Just me? You're not going to be in it? No. OK, what is it? It's for Elixir magazine. Holy... it's crap... It's a shit magazine. All about high key lighting women in nothing next to nothing for no fucking reason. First off, that is not always true. And second, what the fuck are you calling all these little cash shoots that you're doing for spare change? It's not me saying anything. It's just point... and shoot some shit. That's it. OK, well the spare change on this one is 10K. Still not interested, but thank you. Don't do that. Nicky! Nicky, seriously. Dude, you are way too fucking talented to not be moving this shit forward. I didn't move out here to go down someone else's path and neither the fuck did you. See, this is why I'm glad we met. We see eye to eye. Yeah yeah yeah. Go fuck yourself. OK, I got to bail. I've got a shoot. What else we got? What else we got? Shit. Shit. Jesus Christ. Alright. Coming. Fuck. I come bearing gifts. Fuck. Alright, now this is creepy. Wait. How the fuck did you get in here? Door's fucked. Did you take all these? Yeah. Oh, Nicky from Chicago can take a picture. OK, we have to get you out of here and, as luck would have it, I come with a plan. What exactly are we talking about? The People Who Actually Fucking Live Life intro to L.A. The No Bullshit tour. No, I got a shit ton of work to do. No, you don't. Yeah, I do. And also, I'm not into corny fucking tours. Well, are you into corny fucking tours on drugs? Maybe a little. Mm. That's what I thought. No fucking way. This might be the cheesiest fucking thing. Yeah. Isn't that what first dates consist of? Oh. So this is official, huh? Maybe, if you're lucky. OK, if this is the No Bullshit tour, then I'm definitely gonna need more Molly. Oh this? This is what you want? Yeah. Alright, surfing is definitely a thing. It's my thing. And it will soon be done by all of the tragically interesting people everywhere. If you say so. I still say it's dangerous, pushy as fuck, and probably, probably illegal. You like those drugs, right? Yeah. It's a little hypocritical. Fine. Yes, Tessa. Yes, I like the drugs. Hmm. Hmm. OK, so let's recap. We got a little adventure. Yeah. A lot of comedy. Debatable. And we're about to have an epically romantic kiss in the best view in all of Los Angeles. That wasn't cheesy, was it? It was a little fucking cheesy. What are you thinking about? Champagne! No, fuck off. Why? You've been in LA for fucking far too long. Champagne shots. Tequila? Yes. Whiskey? Yes. Champagne? No fucking way. OK, fine. We'll toss a coin. Heads, champagne. Tails, whatever fucking shot you need to feel like a tough guy, Tough Guy. OK, fine. But I'm tossing the coin because I don't fucking trust you. Ready? Fuck! Champagne, please! Really? Oh! That is fucking disgusting. Your face! Alright, what do you want to do next? I want to dance. You can dance? Oh yes. I can dance. I might be the best dancer in the whole world. I move like a fucking fish in water. I fucking believe you. Can you teach me? Yeah, of course. What's going on in there? We're coming out to dance, man! You're so damn good. Sure. No, I mean it. I mean it. You need to be sharing this point of view. No, seriously, I've worked with so many shooters. And none of them have, like, a tenth of your talent. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah. Really? Hmm. That's my favorite photo. Look at those fucking eyes. OK, enough of that crap. I don't know what to think of you. Good. Kind of... Kind of scare me a little bit. Good. Yeah. Good. Mm Hmm. Fucking jeans. Fucking jeans. What are you doing? Don't move, don't move, don't move. No, I look horrible. I have morning breath. First of all, you're gorgeous. And second of all, I promise not to photograph your breath. You are so fucking beautiful. I'm gonna go get a coffee. You want one? Yes, please. Alright. Hey, I forgot my wallet. Tessa. Why are you going through my photos? Nick, I just thought I could help. Help? No, Tessa. What the fuck are you doing? I was emailing my designer friend Rudy some of your photo series. Who? Who the... Who the fuck is Rudy? Rudy is a friend, and I think he'd really like your vibe. And maybe he'd bring you in to shoot his new line. No, no, no, no. Fuck that shit, Tessa. You don't... You don't fucking go through my shit and send it to fucking anybody without asking me first. OK, you need to calm down because you're yelling right now. You see that, right? Yelling? How am I yelling? You're going through my shit! You're fucking welcome. Tessa, hey, um... I'm sorry, OK? I just I get... a little fucking crazy sometimes and I just I... I was an asshole. Could you, could you please forgive me? I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. Come on. Come on. Come here. Tell me you're not obsessing over those photos. Shut it. Huh? What? What's up? Nothing. Alright. Where I'm from people don't get what I'm doing. Actually, my mother she understood, right? But my father... when I told him about my phot- photography. The only thing he said to me was I hope you like the taste of black beans. Meaning... he didn't really think I was going to amount to much. I guess I'm trying to say... Thanks for understanding. You know? OK, you're ready. Ready for what? Hey, how are you? Good to see you, this is Nicky. Come on. What's up, man? Oh. Is that thing still recording? Uh huh. Ooh. Mmm. That's gross. I want to Introduce you to Nemo. Where is that little slut? Oh, there he is. Come, come on. Nemo! Sammy! Honey. Gorgeous. Mmmm. Look at you. You're beautiful. This gold dress. Thank you. Can I borrow it? If you can fit your little tush in it. You know I can. How are you? I'm good. You know, just spicing things up. While more basic bitches flood the catwalk. Oh my God, talking about basic bitches, look at these basic bitches. Here, come with me. Did you know that everyone is a cunt here? Cunt, Cunt, Cunt, C- Who's your handsome cutie pie of a friend? And why haven't I seen you at one of my poisonous soirees. Wait, I know you. I do I had sex with you in a dream once. Meow. What's your name again? Uh, Nemo, this is the photographer slash brilliant artist that I told you about. Oh? Nick Gatto, man. K. It's a pleasure meeting you. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a big fan of your lines, man. Ping, ping, ping. Ping. Especially... Especially the sneakers. Boring. Is he party trained? I guess he is. How dare you, OK? How dare you come to this party, take my friend, drinking my champagne. Look at me. Yeah, I see you in those bedroom eyes, those cherry lips, and you have the nerve to think that somehow I'm going to give you a job? Is that what you think? Well, you're right, it's your lucky day. I'm going to give you a job. I'm going to give you a blow job. Why did you laugh? Sorry, it was too much. A blow job? I could have carried on. You. Listen, man. We were fucking with you, man. You were fucking with me? Truly. I'm sorry, man. She was alright. Hey, listen, I have seen your work. Is it like, Chicago inspired or L.A.? What's the deal? Yeah, I shot some of it in Chicago and some of it here. And I moved to L.A. because I'm trying to fucking figure out, you know, where it's going. Hey mate, We're all trying to figure out what's going on. I believe in you. You're here, right? Yeah. You're in town? Yeah. You're going to put us in contact? Definitely. Keep sending me your stuff, man. Keep doing it and maybe, you know, we'll do something. Wait. What? Are you fucking with me? I'm not fucking with you. You're fucking with me? Im not fucking with you anymore. Seriously, I want to do something. Alright? I dig it, man. For real, OK? Yes? Yeah. I'm not fucking with you. You're great. I love you. Good to see you. I'm going to go mingle with these douche bags. I fucking love you. Thank you. You're welcome. Now, let's both go get laid, shall we? Yes. Thank you. So what exactly is your plan for me, sir? You know, I was thinking that this just isn't really working out, so we should probably just call it quits. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Good. Because I can't stand you. Tessa. Tessa, you, you gotta talk to me here. Come on. Please talk to me. Please. Who... Who were those guys? I'm gonna have to get out. What? I'm going to have to get out of L.A. No. Mm mmm. Tessa, you can trust me. You know that, right? You can, you can... You can trust me. Come on. Just tell me what the fuck is going on. When I first got to LA, I went to a party in the hills and it was the end of the night. I was about to call a ride. I... lost consciousness. And... My next memory is by a pool. I was completely naked on a pool chair. And the youngest one, his name's Matteo, he kissed me. It's really confusing because the way that he was with me was, like, I was forgetting that like we were already together or something. And... I remember us having sex but it didn't... didn't feel like rape because he was being sweet. And, well, I was out of it. And I know that because my next memory is the tatted up one on top of me. He was so much bigger than me. He was rough and aggressive. And then the next one. It just went from, like, confusing to a fucking nightmare. Like, how did I not remember anything? How was I so fucked up? I remember them laughing and they were taking photos and videos because I'd come to and seen, like, a phone in my face. And it was fucking just a blur. And... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Did, did you go to the police? I tried. So what happened to them? I tracked down the girl who invited me, and she told me who these people are. Nicky, they're not the kind of people you can just get arrested and then it's over. So, you think your only option is to... is to... leave L.A. and run from this? I can't. I can't. I... I told myself that it was over. You know, it was just like a fuckin', a crazy fucking situation I got myself into with people from another world and I'd never see them again. And I would never put myself in that position. And... they were fucking there. They were there, Nicky. And they saw me. They saw me. OK, we'll pack up the car right now and we'll get the fuck out of here. We're out of here. I'm not asking you to do that. Nicky. I've never met anyone like you. Somewhere in the middle of the past few weeks I fell in love with you. Me too. But, um... seeing them... It just, it made me realize it wasn't a fucking dream or nightmare. Its real, you know, and I can't bury it and I... They're fucking animals, Nicky. No. I can't. I can't imagine you're not here. I don't want to lose you. Don't leave, don't leave me. Because I, I, I... I need you. I do. Do you need me? Do you love me? Of course I do. Then kill them. They don't deserve to breathe. They don't deserve to breathe. Tessa, are you hearing yourself? You're asking me to kill people. I... I ca- I'm asking you to love me enough to protect me from animals. I... I can't. I just, I... I can't, I can't do that. Hey, hey, I understand, I understand. Yeah. No. Yeah. Please, please, Tessa, where are you going? I don't know. I can't stay here. Yes, you can. No, I can't. You have a choice here. I don't have a choice. Yes, you do. No, I don't. I don't. I fucking don't! Yes, you... Hey, how you doing? Hey, where the fuck are our girls? I pitched our girls. But the brand, You know, they handle casting. They do what they want. You know how it is. Who's that? It's Vincent. Did he hire these girls? He might have had a say. It's, look, he's great. They're great. I talked to them. They're really nice. Look, I know it's not what you expected, but they're really cool. I talked to them. No, this is... This is... This is bullshit, Sam. Look, it's just one day. And you can just do your thing. I'll figure it out. Is he alright? Yeah, he's great. Eyes. A little to the right to the right... to the right to the right. Right here. I want to do some blood effects on her eyes but I don't want it to be too theatrical. I just want a little bit under, dripping down. Like a blanket, like a red blanket. Faith, where's that blood? Hey man, um, can I get a quick minute, if that's OK? Yeah. Sorry about that. Sorry. Sorry. Just over here. Yeah. This isn't the aesthetic we agreed on. What are you trying to do? Yeah, I'm just going to pivot. Pivot? She's wearing pale makeup. This is meant to be high fashion. What's going on here? It's going to be great. Alright? Clea, Moira, can I get you over here?

It's just fucking life, Now, she's gone. She's gone. I don't know where the fuck she is. She's gone. Look, I'm sorry to hear that, man, I am. OK but that shoot was not what we had talked about and it was some dark shit. What are you saying? You just said it was genius. And fucking Vince? He loves it. Yeah. So, what's the issue? Yes, I did. And obviously he does. But the point is, I don't know where it's coming from and I'm trying to make sure that you're OK. Just give me a fucking break, alright? Hey, it's Tessa, leave a message. Hey, it's me... um... Could you please just call me back, huh? I just I... I got to hear your voice, you know, I just got to know you're alright. I mean, come on this can't be it and all that.
