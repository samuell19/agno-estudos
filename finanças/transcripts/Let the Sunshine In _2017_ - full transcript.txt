There. You coming? Come! No? You come. Go on. I feel good. I'm good. Go on, come. Go on. Come on... With your previous friend, did you come easily? Honey. Please talk to me. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Come here. Call you tomorrow? See you this weekend? LET THE SUNSHINE IN Hello there! Shopping in the neighborhood? Good fish here. - Very. How are you doing? Okay? No. Me neither. Same old story. We're never satisfied. It's never all at once. We want things to click, but they don't. So we satisfy our various desires in various ways, but it never works. I'm glad I bumped into you. I was thinking of calling you. I wanted to suggest something that might do you good. My mother died last year and left me a house in the Lot. Come some time, if you like. Whenever you want. You can come and go. Stay as long as you please. I don't think so. I'm not doing great right now. What's going on with you? Oh, you know... a young woman... - Hello, ma'am. What'll it be? I'd like... Weren't you going to call? Sorry. I couldn't. I waited all weekend. I'm in love with you. You might pay a little attention to me. I can't always do what I want. Listen, this is too hard. When you say you'll call, call. Or else this won't last much longer. Dictatorship of the proletariat! What was that? What? I said “dictatorship of the proletariat.” Does that annoy you? It's annoying if you can't laugh, but you can. Right? Nice chair. You masturbate this weekend? - Did you? - No. You made love. I'm married. Or maybe you got yourself some hookers? No ice cubes. Take that back. Bring two empty glasses. Not a large Perrier, a small one. Put the bottle there. I'll pour. Then you can put it away. Good. Now you got it. Excellent. You know, I know Maxime well. Your new... associate. Yes, of course. I know. We handled the merger of the galleries. I didn't know that. Anyway- -- I figured you knew her. In this milieu... And as a banker, you must know everyone. I knew her before she joined management at the gallery. I've known her for ages. You may not know, but she had a thing with your... ex... ex-husband, ex-spouse. With Mandelbaum. They had a thing. - What? - You didn't know? When? So you didn't know? I don't know when. Come on! She had a thing with Frangois? Who said that? - She did. - When did she say that? - I don't know. About two years ago. At least. I can't remember. When I was with him, or after that? I don't know. I'd say it was before. She'd have told me. Impossible. She said it very matter-of-factly. I don't know why she'd have lied. Does it bother you? I'm about to work with her. Yes, it bothers me. Working with her is an amazing opportunity. She'll get you shown internationally. It's wonderful. I don't know. Are you sure? No, impossible. You're wrong. Impossible. She said so. I have no reason not to believe her. I think it's over now. I don't know. Maybe. I don't get it. It's strange. It's unhealthy if it's true. You're sure? Yes. I shouldn't have told you. It's over now. It's no big deal. - Could you put the bottle away? - Sure. I mean now. Of course. You have any gluten-free olives? - Gluten-free olives? - Yes. You have any? I'll go ask, sir. And bring me a cup of hot water. No lemon. Just very hot water. Got it? Excellent. Why use that tone? He's nice. Why? You interested? You found yourself quite a match. You deserve better. You don't know this... but I admire you. Really? I do. You're an amazing woman. Now you know there's a man in Paris who thinks you're extraordinary. It's simple. I'd like to be you. I would like to be you. It's true. You don't realize you have the best job in the world. There's nothing better. Don't you like what you do? You never talk about your work. Because it's not fulfilling. Being a banker isn't interesting? My job is alienating. You're lucky not to be alienated. My banker colleagues never read books, never go out. Lives limited to weekends in Normandy in little cottages with their families. Boring bourgeois types. Not like you. You find that funny? So what interests you in life? Life's pleasures. The beauties of this world. The gentleness of this world. Touch this. It's a bit swollen. Don't worry. It's soft flannel. I'll answer the question you're not asking. I'll never leave my wife. You enchant me, but my wife is extraordinary. A pain at times, even exhausting, but extraordinary. But you charm the pants off me. It could be nice if we play it smart. Very nice. Your hot water. I have to stop by my office. I feel like walking. Take my car. My driver can drop you anywhere. Thanks a lot. Really lots and lots. Have a nice day. Thanks. Bye. This just can't work. Being a backstreet lover is unbearable! Am I with him? Am I with him or not? I don't know. I'm tired. I'm tired. Is this my life? I want to find love. Real love. I'm running into a wall anyway. Why couldn't it be different for once? Why, why, why? I don't get it. I'm thrilled you're joining me at the gallery. I'll take good care of you. I'll do everything I can. Whatever it takes. You'll see. You're a great artist, you know. Excuse me. May I ask you something? Of course. Go ahead. This is very embarrassing, but... I'm sorry. Just say it. Just say it. Go on. If there's something, say it. Please. Tell me. All right, I'll say it. Forgive me. It's a sensitive subject. I'm incredibly embarrassed. I'm really sorry. Say it. Listen... This is ridiculous. It's none of my business. But if I don't say it, it'll spoil things between us. That's it. Go on... say it. Yes, I'll say it... or it won't be good for work. Sorry to ask you something that's none of my business. Listen... I heard someone say... that... you had a thing... with Frangois Mandelbaum. Absolutely not! But in the future... why not? You know who told me that? Vincent Briot. The banker? I'm sick of the nightly grind. But that's theater. That's what makes it tough. Audiences there for one performance don't see it. But the nightly grind is tough. Sorry to bother you. Congratulations. You were amazing. It's my second time. I'm just as moved. Your take on the role is... so modern. So personal, I think. Thanks! - Thank you. Bravo. I'll be back. He's great, isn't he? Maybe it's just personal. My own problem. Maybe I'm tired of the daily grind. Hence, the nightly grind. For a personal reason. My daily grind is a pain. Your daily grind? Yeah, my daily grind. My life. Meaning? My life these days. My current daily grind is a pain. So it's the fact... you don't know what to do all day long, that your days are empty and meaningless? My day-to-day life right now... it's like... it's weighing on me. My wife and I are breaking up, so... My life is lacking in desire. Anyway, it'll come back. And I can find desire elsewhere. “Elsewhere” meaning... where? The unknown. The unknown? Does your life bore you? No, I never get bored. I'm fine just vegetating. I'm never bored. And I drink a lot... which causes intermediary states. Except when I lose it. One word is all it takes. It can get a little... violent. Meaning? At home. Truth 'vs... only I know it's over with my wife. I'm leaving, but only I know. I'll let things get toxic out of cowardice. I'll let things get toxic. I can't tell her it's over. I'm afraid of what it'll trigger. But are things really over? I don't know... So I'm not in control right now. Of course, meeting you is part of the picture. Are we eating or not? Are you hungry? It's up to you. You hungry? Want to eat? I'm a little hungry. Weren't we going to have dinner? To talk about our project? I don't know... The stuff you brought up is so... intimate, that suddenly - You threw me off a bit. I didn't expect that. I didn't know either. I was just asking if... Yes, we can go have dinner. To talk. Wasn't that the plan? And we already are talking. I just wanted to say that my personal stuff... isn't... isn't more important than the fact that we're meeting. Everything is still open and possible, but... But? In fact - Listen, let's go get dinner. Have some drinks. Can I drop you off? Sure. So... So... I feel like we said nothing. We got nowhere. I'm just tired. We said things... then we said the opposite. I'm not working tomorrow. We could go see a movie. I'll call you. So... see you tomorrow. I'll call you when I wake up. I don't know. Then I'll call you and we'll see. I don't know if you should bother calling. Park so we can talk about it for a minute! No use beating around the bush for hours. Whatever you say. No point meeting again. It's going nowhere. What's that look? I feel like a spurned lover, that's why. And you don't get it. I don't understand... how you can feel like a spurned lover. Seriously... I don't get it. You said no point meeting again, that it's going nowhere. Yes, I said that. And you don't see why? Sure, I said it, but don't listen to everything I say. Really? - No. - I see. So there. So there, so there. I feel you just want me to get out of this car. I'm not in any rush. Not for you to leave. Listen, I'm sorry... but I really feel the only thing you want is for me to get out of this car. You're wrong. So you want me to go or stay? I want you to stay. Then come in for half an hour. You have your daughter! She's at her father's! For a week! I'd love a drink. I don't have much. Nothing. Just this. Is this okay? What do you want me to say? I don't know. What I'm feeling? You say it. No... Definitely not. Then why should I? I don't know. What about you? Could you do it? Are you capable of saying it? Would you know what to say? Probably. But I'd feel too naked. At the mercy of... Will you show me out? That feels good. Sometimes there's no need to talk. So what do you want? Should I stay or go? You should stay. I couldn't bear it anymore. It feels so good to stop all that talking. I thought it would never end. It's nice when it ends. I'll shut the door. Where to? Where to? You mean what room? In there? Come on. Beautiful room, Isabelle. Talk tomorrow? Wonderful... If we see each other again, could we not make love? We shouldn't have slept together. Just listened to music. This isn't a love thing. There was ambiguity, no love. Why did I bring up my personal life? To show off? To seduce you? But this isn't a love thing. I just got in from Brazil and felt like banging you. I'm a strange guy, huh? Maybe so, but I'm busy. You're not funny. Your offer doesn't interest me. You didn't used to say that. Were you crying? I'm tired. You won't like this, but I'll say it anyway. Crying is for maids. And monkeys. You know what happens next? You open that door... you leave, and you never come back. I'll open it for you. Leave now. - I thought - Stop thinking. Don't ever come back here. I want the last word! Like in a tacky bedroom farce? You're a scumbag! Well, I'll be! Same place as last time. I hope you're well... or better, or at least getting by. I thought of two things since last time. I thought of two things. I have two proposals, both decent. First, it would make me happy if we had dinner sometime soon, whenever suits you. The second thing... I'm re-inviting you to the Lot. Next weekend, or the 24th-25th. There's an excellent contemporary art festival in the region. Now that the house is fixed up, more welcoming... I'll send my chambermaid so we're not sullied by household chores. I'll spend the week, or part of it. You spend as long as you want, if you like. That's very kind of you... Mathieu. Are you feeling better? Yes, I'm okay. How about you? Without getting into details, yes,yes. I'm happy to hear you're better. You mean a lot to me. That's nice. Think over my propositions. I'll let you call. Don't forget! I promise! What? I can't hear. There's no reception. I'll call you back. So... you regret it. Yes, I regret it. But meeting you was unique. Nothing like you before... and nothing like you after. Hooking up and regretting it the next day... God knows it happens often. It's always easy to set straight, but not with you. I regret that it happened like this. This isn't a love thing. I wish we'd hung out a bit. Let things happen naturally... or not happen. But I felt bad afterwards. I regretted it. How did you feel afterwards? What did you think? - Was I happy? Yeah. How did you feel? I felt good. Listen... you regret it and I don't. Once you decide “it's not a love thing”... you can't go back like nothing happened. If you regret it, you regret it. We can't go back and pretend nothing happened. We can't meet again as if nothing happened. We should end it... I like before. I like everything before. ...for good. It happened. It's behind us. Too fast. There was no time to see what hit me. We ruined everything. Whatever was going to happen is done, and I like what's before. Now there's no before. Maybe there is. Maybe there still is a before. Before the second time. The first time is over and done with. So there's... a before the second time? The first time is over with, right? So there's still... a before after that? No, it's over. There's no other solution. I agree. I thought you wanted to see me again. You surprise me. I didn't think you'd agree. You're crazy. I said I agree. Okay, fine then! Anyway, there are no other solutions. Anyway, I have to go. I promised to bring home a pizza. Long live family. Can I call you back in a few minutes? I'm busy. When did you say you'd call him back? In a few minutes. A few minutes. What are you doing tonight? Ah, no. “In a few minutes.” There's a play tonight. Oh, you can't. “In a few minutes.” I don't know. Am I supposed to say something? It's up to you. Up to me. No problem if I keep quiet? No. How are you, sir? Are you okay? Meaning? I ask because I'm not doing great, so I was wondering if you were. I don't want to talk in banalities. I want us... to talk. Find out if you're happy. It's not always easy. I'm going home. I'm fed up. My day was... very tough. Want some music? Or maybe you prefer silence? How about you? We can put on some music. I'll put on some relaxing music. It'll do us good. I choose the moment. Every day I choose a moment. A Panel a day? Yes, every day. I think... I look at the sky and choose a moment. Sometimes I only had 10 minutes, because the sky was changing quickly. The weather conditions. At most I had 40 minutes with a calmer sky that wasn't moving much. So it's a self-imposed regimen? Yes, it was really crucial not to miss a day. Good evening, Isabelle. Good evening, Isabelle. How about a drink? I'd love one. What? Perrier, if you find any. Good evening, Isabelle. Isabelle, I'm sad. I can't talk. I'm on the other line. Can I call tomorrow? You free for lunch? I'm really sad. We can't throw this away like old dishwater. I'll be right back. You know what made me come with the banker? - Money? - No, not money. Thinking he was a bastard. An old bastard. I'd think, “He's a bastard”... and I'd come. Or I'd imagine him with a whore. Or with his wife. So ugly with her lifeless face. A real cadaver. Him fucking her out of pity would make me come. Just sordid things like that. Thinking “bastard” was enough. At least at first. I'd concentrate and think, “What a bastard”... and I'd have an orgasm. That's all it took. It was true, so it was easy. Fantasies always have an element of truth. But I swear, Ariane, it worked. At least at first. Later on... a lot less. Some things... I can't even tell you. He was actually a real shit. It got unbearable. I don't think I'll get through this. It's like my love life is behind me. It's all over. It's all over. There's nothing left. Nonsense! Aren't you in love with your actor? I don't know. There's a real problem. Why did I leave Frangois? Frangois adored you. And you have a child together. That counts. And he was supportive of your work. That counts too. You know he called me? We met, he came over... Did it go well? Yeah, he spent the night. We made love. And it was... The next morning, I thought I was so happy, that I was so lucky, that my life was extraordinary! The next day, I realized it was just the opposite. We met, we talked for a good while... but it was the talk of two depressed souls who met and loved but who can't anymore. Not together, not separately... They don't want to hurt each other. They protect each other. They lie. They play it safe, in case they find no one else... or in case they have to stay together. He asked me to go on vacation with him. Come to Corsica. We've rented a house. I'm going to work this summer. Anyway, you get me talking but you say nothing. Like what? I don't know. How are you? Okay? I'm fine. Pascal and I get along better and better in every way. In every way. Think I don't know what that means? Yeah, right! In every way. Isabelle? I'm here. Frangois. What? What was that? That's not you. It is. I swear it is. No, it's not natural. It doesn't suit you. Like you're watching yourself do it. Not at all. Like you're doing something you saw somewhere. That's how I see it. It's not natural. It's fake. I need to be alone. I'm sorry, but... I can't. CONTEMPORARY ART FESTIVAL Beautiful, isn't it? Gorgeous. İsn't it? It's gorgeous. The countryside here is beautiful. Look at that little house. Where? My lawyer had a country house here. Maybe we can see it. When we still had our house in the Gard, my wife and I paid him a visit. It's so peaceful! You have to be crazy to crowd onto a beach. I've always loved these hilly landscapes. We want to buy around here too. Really? It's nice here. Bravo! As for us... we go to the coast and sail. We rent a boat, invite some friends, and set out. We stay at sea for a few days. Or else we stop in empty inlets. There's no one. It's Wild. We've done it for years. - How lucky! - It's very pleasant. Look up there! A flock of wild geese coming down... right... now! What fascinates me is that this landscape is nothing. Shapes, colors, a bit of sunlight. Yet it becomes part of us and does us good. It's totally intact. That's rare today, nature that looks like nature. All this makes me wonder about something. Would a 17th-century peasant waking up to all his chores be as sensitive to this beauty as we are? - I don't agree at all. - With what? You're asking the wrong question - Yes, we know, we know! It's all yours, all of it! Earth, sky, mountains! Everything! The libraries too! Don't worry. We won't steal anything. Even the birds! The birds are yours too. They're leaving now, but they'll be back! Don't worry, it's all yours! It's all yours! All of it! Are you all right? The landscapes are yours too. Did you go out on the walk? Yes. We were freezing. It's ice-cold here too. You got out of it. I stayed at the hotel bar with the reporter from Limoges. You know, country landscapes... What I like most is watching people. Are you in love now? When not in love, what do you do? Nothing. No sex? Nothing at all? Nothing. That must be hard. It can go on a long time. I know. Even when it's a long time, you never allow yourself a wild night now and then? Sure, making love is better when you're in love, but it's good to let yourself go, then go back to your routine. I don't let myself go. It can do you good. You're not in love, you let yourself go, you meet a waitress, a research scientist, a dentist, a puppeteer, or an artist! I'm going. I'm takmg the tram at 7:00 am. Are you coming? - Yes. He's a good dancer. I'm sorry if I hurt you last time. It's okay. I'm off. Listen... Anyway... we tried. This may not be the best time, but I have something to ask. Could I have my keys back? I don't believe it. I wasn't going to keep them. And you gave them to me when it suited you. I know that, Frangois. Why do you need them? To give to someone else? You found someone “natural”? I hope he's a decent guy. I worry about Cécile. Meaning? She tells me things. Really? So actually... no. I think I'll keep the keys. My daughter lives here, right? And I still own half this apartment. Even more than half. When Cécile comes over, she talks. She says you cry almost every night. You cry, and she sees you cry. Is that healthy for a 10-year-old? Your life is none of my business, but what's not good for her is my business. So I'll keep the keys for now. - Give them to me. - I don't have them on me! Have you seen that guy again? We came back to Paris together. That's all. - And? I came back with him, and we're still together. I'm jealous! You live with him? We just met three weeks ago. We don't live together. But you're together? Sorry to ask, but why did he fall in love with you? I don't know! That's not for me to say. I can see him falling in love with you. It's the vice versa I don't get. - Why? - Come on! Do you two talk? Yes. A lot. Does he understand how our profession works? I don't know. Does it matter? No. Sorry. You're right. But what do you talk about? Lots of things. Anyway, we talk. Do you do things together? See each other's friends? - Never? - No, it just hasn't happened yet. We usually hang out at my place. We go for walks. It won't last. No couple can live in a bubble without a social environment. Does he have friends? Why doesn't he take you along to see them? Maybe he's afraid I won't be interested. Maybe he wouldn't feel comfortable. Or maybe they'd be uncomfortable. Or he'd feel divided. They're two different worlds. Sometimes you're not comfortable. I understand what you have to offer. So explain. Why do you say what I have to offer? It's obvious! You offer a legitimacy he'd never have had. But besides his exoticism... and having some fun - Sure, okay, that's great. Have fun, enjoy it for now... but keep a little distance or you'll suffer. He'll never give you what you need. Why not? Trust me, you'll see. Have fun. Enjoy. He never sees your friends? We just met three weeks ago. Who knows if either of us will want it to last? How does he get by? On welfare? I don't know. I didn't ask. Meet someone from your milieu, or it'll never work. Same old story. You'll just have your work to get by. But... you want more. You're entitled to more. You want to be happy, don't you? Of course. What's his name? Sylvain. And he's met your daughter? Your own milieu. Trust me. It can't work - I don't feel comfortable with those people, Fabrice. You've got me all wrong. Okay, you want something new. And it's normal he's into you. It's you I don't get. Live it but don't believe it. How do you have a relationship with someone... without believing it? Don't get too involved. Anyway, I wouldn't bet one cent on that relationship. Did he go to school? High school grad? Yes, he graduated high school. You're incredible! I have to admire someone to love them. Sure, I could go fall in love with a hairdresser, but I wouldn't live with her. I might possibly sleep with her. But that's all. Good-bye. Thanks. Nice parka. Looks good on you. Sylvain, where are you? I have to see you right away. I have things to tell you. Specific questions... about us, our commitment. Why don't we ever see your friends together? Why don't you ever come see mine? Fabrice says your being with me gives you a legitimacy. He said to have fun with you but not to believe it. To meet someone from my milieu. He asked if we saw friends. I said no. He said it wouldn't last. Then let's end it. That's not what I want. Then stop hurting me. It's not right. He hurt you, so you hurt me. That's stupid. How can a smart girl like you do that? Truth is, you're like them. - No, I'm not like them. - You are! Yes, you are. Stay with them, and I'll stay with my friends. See there? He was right to tell me that. What did you answer when he said all that? Nothing. You said nothing. No, I said nothing. Too bad for you. What could I say? Maybe you could say... “Stop bad-mouthing the man I love.” He said something awful. - Don't say it! - I mean about himself. He said he could love a hairdresser - Who is this guy? What does he do? He has a gallery. A gallery. So he's smart. He should understand. Look how worked up it gets you. Look at you. Why stay with those people? Come to me, Isabelle. Come to me. I feel good with you. Me too. Really? Of course. But I didn't know if you - I know. That's my problem. No one ever knows what I think. It's nice holding your hand. I'm glad you put your hand in mine. This means a lot to me. I have to go... or I'll do something stupid. Want to come over for five minutes? It's close. Ten minutes. I'll make some tea. I don't think it's a good idea. I want to stop jumping into things. Then why did you kiss me? I don't get it. You took my hand... so I kiss you. So it's just being polite? No. How can you say that? I don't want to rush things. Stay with me! Please! Please stay with me a bit longer. Otherwise it's meaningless. I understand your reaction. But if you give me an ultimatum, I'll shut down. Lockdown mode. I'm taking my kids on vacation. We'll meet in a month, if you're still here. I like what's happening between us. You see the space that goes from here... to here. The thing I like most is when you speak softly in my ear. It feels good. I don't know what to say. I'd like - But at the same time, no. I mean, not me - Enough. You're a good man, David. What good does that do? It's important. Good-bye. David! Will we meet again? I don't think so. How could I have believed in it? The only thing you have to be careful about is not to pick up any emotional interference. Because you're vulnerable in that domain. I also get the impression you've recently undergone... a period... that was like being in limbo. Not an easy time. But repercussion-wise, I think we're progressively sweeping all of that away. That's exactly how I'd tend to see things now. On a different note... I'd evoke manifestations that are artistic and creative, etc. I like how you see the big picture. The way you feel things... see things... and analyze them deep within yourself. We'll have to see how things play out. Painting may have a certain importance for you. That's what I'm picking up. We'll have to explore that later. To begin with, I'd like to know if these elements speak to you, on the whole. That's important for me. If they do, good. In which case I'll keep examining things in detail. Now I'm supposed to react? That's right. To what I just heard, right? That's right. That's exactly it. The most obvious thing, to save you from - You just mentioned painting. I'm an artist. It's my life. So you got that right. Sol... Honestly, the question is... It's my emotional relationships that... I keep obsessing about. Last year I met someone... who really had an effect on me. Here, I have some pictures. I'll get to those. And there's another person I want to bring up. I have no pictures of him. He just came into my life. I'd like to know if - So him... He's the one who came into my life last year. I see. It must not have been easy. Maybe even a bit... devastating. Yes, but fulfilling too. But I don't know if it's over. How old is the other person? He's 50. But I don't have a photo. But nothing's happened with him. I don't know... You have to help there, because I don't know. This one will bounce back... with a new mindset. He may see things differently, with newfound maturity. That's the feeling I get. He'll try to get in touch again. Problem is, he can be on the borderline. He has to be careful... not to go off into something... I think he can bring fulfillment. But you have to be careful of his mood swings. Because that's... that's the impression I get. Because it can make him... go off. He goes off easily. So... well, anyway. You're going to see him again. Really? You'll see him again. You'll hear from him. He'll resurface. He'll shine in his profession. He'll do something that's not bad. You'll hear from him. He'll want to see you again. That day, I suggest you don't close the door. See what he has to say... how he behaves. Pardon the expression but... will he try to “reset the table”? I'd say yes, he will. But is he the ideal person for you? No. Is he your future... the man with whom you'll walk down the great road of life? No, I don't think so. Something else is coming. It will be a lot meatier... weightier. Sturdier too. That's what I feel. Shall I tell you about the other person? You'll see the one in the picture again. There will be others, I'm telling you. Others? Other people who show up on your doorstep. I wonder if you're going to meet someone who's an actor or in that domain. You'll see. You attract people like that. People like that? Actors, people like that. There's one you'll re-attract. To start with, I think he has dark hair. And it's something that will also be... mutually intense. Less unbalanced than this one. This is a bit chaotic. Not easy to handle. At some point... you may get fed up with the chaos. That's why I say something new is coming, to help you understand that deep down... your future is perhaps more in that direction than with him. So then... even if I have a future elsewhere, with someone else... I don't lose him entirely, do I? It's not easy with him. He won't accept just being a friend... unless he evolves. That remains to be seen. So the other one... The other one is 50? Yes. I don't have a photo. Want to know his name? Marc. He works in a museum. I met him in a professional context. And I... That's what I was saying. You need people out of the ordinary. There may also be someone who's a bit of an adventurer... who comes into your life. Or a messenger. Someone who experiences things with his faith. Someone authentic. You need someone authentic. From what I'm picking up, you need someone authentic. It could be the one from the museum. This one is pretty brilliant. From what I'm picking up... he can use it but not abuse it. He can use it but not abuse it. Meaning? I mean, his brilliant side. He can use it. He's a man of consequence. He represents something. But watch out. I think this man is in a period of transition... including emotionally. You're there... but you mustn't be used like some transitional element to help him cross to the other shore. You have to be careful of that. HOW? Don't let yourself be used. Because... I get the impression he's a man who can have whims. Attractive whims. Tics. So you fall in love. Fine... but what do I do afterwards? That's all fine, but I don't want to be used. I'm not just an individual to be used as a crutch or a cane to help people cross from one shore to the other. That won't work. Because, pardon the expression... you mustn't come out of it bruised and battered. Because he feasts on you... feeling good, etc. And then, pardon the image... I finished feasting, and now what? So for example, the one who's 50 - I don't think he's the love of your life. Idoubtfi. I think... the love of your life is someone else. So as of now, you're not shielded. Which is better. You're still going to be... in a position to meet other people who will reveal themselves. Be... “open.” But... this one's going to - I won't lose him. He'll be back. Yes, which doesn't mean nothing will happen before that. He'll come back... and you have this 50-year-old waving hello. Let them come. “Open.” Stop getting yourself all in a stew. It serves no purpose whatsoever. Live what you have to live. Take care of yourself. Don't fall into traps. That's all I ask. Because the 50-year-old is - He's a trap. Because he's a mirage. You can show me another picture once he resurfaces. That way we won't waste time. We'll kill two birds with one stone. I'm certain I'm right about this 50-year-old. I see you with people better than him... with more charisma, more depth. You'll have plenty of that. And the actor will reappear. You'll see. If I were you, I wouldn't torture myself. Tend to what matters most. Right now, that's you. Me, my work, and I tend to my business. I let things happen. I don't concern myself with the rest. I try to find a beautiful sun within. That's all I ask of you. All right. So the idea is I come back here ONCE... once the other one comes back. Is that it? And in the meantime, you're “open.” Open. That's all I ask of you. Open.
