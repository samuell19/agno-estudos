I can see now. My sweet son, death is only a veil of smoke. All you have to do is stretch your hand through it. And you will find, the ones you love. This, is where I found her. - Hello. - Good morning. Hi. I'm Stellan, your advisor. - Eva. - Okay. I'll show you around. - This way please. - Thank you. So... This is for the library. And this is for the museum. It gives you access 24/7. And this is for the coffee machine. - Thank you. - So, ancient medical. The Renaissance. And in the library we have a, number of, texts on pre-Columbian shamanic medicine. Actually, my research will focus on 18th century medicine. Yeah, yeah, I know. I just wanted to show you the baby. - Okay. - Okay? And I'm really sorry I don't have the time to, show you the 18th century, but you can find it yourself at the end of the corridor. Oh! - Okay? - All right. Eva! What are you doing?! Where are you going?! Sit down! We haven't finished talking! What are you doing?! Answer me! Answer me! Look at me! Dont touch me! The test results suggest that the therapy is putting a strain on your heart. Which considering your condition, is an added complication. You took a big risk by moving here, you know. - I'm here now. - Indeed you are. - Hey! - I brought donuts, and coffee. Hey, come. I'm, really sorry about yesterday. I was stressed, I was in a hurry. Don't be. You don't need a throne over me. Well, lets see. You graduated from medical school, at the University of Leiden... with top marks. Your thesis, was on the application of biotechnology in oncology. You became a surgeon, before making this hard decided to drop everything. And go study the case of an 18th-century doctor living in a remote district of Prussia. So what's so bizarre about that? Well, you have to say your, profile is quite unusual. Can I ask you something? Why Dr. Anmuth? I want to understand why doctors have stopped listening to patients. When did patients' dreams and their perceptions of their bodies become irrelevant? It wasn't like that before the 19th century, maybe you and Anmuth's work proves it. And look at the 18th century anatomical models in this museum, they're perfect. At that time, the study of the human body made enormous strides. They were able to reconstruct it in every detail. Yet at the same time, doctors stopped looking at patients as people, and instead started to busy themselves with the physical body only. The body has become an object, the field we play our games on. Why did we cross the border of the skin? Hey, I wanna show you something. Come on. - Now? - Yeah. This is the most precious book in the collection, Eva. Hundreds of personal accounts from Anmuth's patients, faithfully recorded by him. There is no book on the doctor/patient relationship like this. It's unique. And I'm trying to find examples where cases presented in this book, show up in the correspondence he kept with dignitaries and other people. I'm sure there must be connections between the to, but I haven't found them yet. - Maybe you will. - Yes. - There. - You okay? - Yeah. - Eva? - You okay? - Yep! I was worried about you. The way you ran off the other day. - Do they have names? - Yes. - What? - This is Alexander. - Like the boy? - Yeah. This is Tina. It's okay. I wonder where they would go, if there was no roof. She's close. She's about to find me. She's a few pages away from where we all come from. 18 of April 1729. My young servant Mary Ann, was about to give birth. Her dreams about it were very clear. She was in pain, so I gave her red coral powder. But the pain increased. It was not my practice to attend deliveries. But because of my affection for Maria, I assisted the midwife who arranged for Maria to give birth in a barn, since the emergency required prompt action, and a certain degree of discretion. Alright Maria. All right. This isn't a child. Maria... I don't understand. Maria ate well with you, not like other women who have nothing to eat. Go. Arise. When nature expels the contents of the uterus before it's time... the process is known as amvlosis, from the Greek. Referring to buds on a grapevine that fall off, before new shoots have time to grow. Maria's dreams portray a completely different scenario: a normal but unwanted pregnancy. Dreams sometimes mislead the physician. Elizabeth von Ouerbach, the governor of Tecklenburg's consort, gave me evidence of this, some years ago. I felt my heart beating, blood pumping vigorously. Everything was red, and whirling. And then I collapsed, exhausted. Your dream, sounds more like that of a woman with child... ...than a woman with a fever. I don't think that's possible. My husband's a man full of ambition, a sense of duty. The years pass, like the span of one day, for a man with a military career. An officer has to think of his Kingdome's future first, and then of his own familys. I have learned to accept it. Even though I was brought up in a family more dedicated to the art of literature, than the art of war. Perhaps that's why my dreams are so unusual. "Only in spring grow the quinces and the pomegranates..." "watered by streams in the inviolated garden of the maidens", "and the swelling grape blossoms bloom, beneath the shade of the vine shute." "But for me... there is no season when love lies quiet." Ever since then, a part of me still dwells in her rooms. Put it down! There. You requested to see me, Mr. Langwer? I thank you with all my heart for coming, madam. Well... I have been wanting to tell you this for some time. I believe Master Gunter is very gifted. He needs upped most attention, particularly with regard to his studies of Latin and philosophy. It would therefore be appropriate if young master Valentin, were to be instructed by another teacher. I don't see the connection. So the time I dedicate myself exclusively to Master Gunter, his level of study requires greater effort. Valentin... what do you think? I am pleased mama, because the teacher smells. Your advice has been precious, Mr. Langwer. Gunter's progress fills me with joy. As you can see, young Valentin agrees. We'll start looking for a new teacher. I am pleased that my humble request can be honored, madame. And as for you, Master Valentin, you must study, without distraction. - The candles are lit. - To welcome you home, Heinz. I thank you, Elizabeth, but I'm only passing through. Then your visit here is even more important. I have something to tell you. Your third son will be born this summer. This fills me with joy, Elizabeth. I've decided to engage a new physician to help Johan Anmuth. A worthy young man who would take over of some of his cases. And now, after the splendid news you've given me, he will care for you, during your confinement. But, Johan saw me through the birth of our two sons. It is no longer possible for this family to be under the care of Johan Anmuth. I beg of you Elizabeth... do not question my decision. My baby is fine. What? My baby is fine. He's at the tree. - What are you talking about? - You shouldn't be sad. It's blood no longer, it's sap. Mario, listen to me... don't you understand that by speaking like this, you give credence to everything they say about you? They talk to me, those they call dead. Maria, they are called dead, because they cease to live. I don't know what they are then. But they talk to me. Valentin? - Who brought you here? - Maria. Did she? Well it's nice to see you. You've grown. - Who's that? - That's me. Thank goodness, I thought it was me! Let's look at ourselves. See if we can make a picture of the two of us. Gunter, wait their. General von Ouerbach. Please. To what do I owe the honor of this visit? Unfortunately, there has been some unrest at Tecklenburg. And with unrest, rumors start. The fruit of ignorance and superstition. The rumors, deal with a presumed witchcraft. With a curse, that is impeding women from giving birth normally. They say your blood lettings, are ineffective. Some of the more senseless gossips are asserting that the bloodlettings are the instruments of the curse. It's all nonsense. And we shouldn't give it any credit, be sure of that. But rumors can become dangerous and inconvenient. You must have heard the rumor, that your servant, or as the commoners called her, the sorceress, was carrying your child, and that it was somewhat to your advantage to get rid of it. I want you to know, that I would never believe such absurd. Maria is like a daughter to me. I have known you for many years, Anmuth, and I have complete faith in your integrity. You have always attentively looked after my family. Oh well, I'm sorry to say, it was extremely unfortunate that you took Maria into your care. Her family, were barely able to care for themselves, let alone another child. I have no doubt, about my decision. Would you mind, asking your boy, not to meddle with my instruments? Gunter! I understand your motives, Anmuth, but I have my responsibilitys towards the citizens, and His Majesty King Fredrik Vilhelm. These rumors must be uprooted. Superstition gnaws into the mind of the people. It is a word that weakens us. The great road we are building will welcome a new era in our small county. Finally, we will become a true part of Prussia, and not just its remote echo. You need to rest. That is why I've decided to engage a new physician to assist you: Nils Lindgren, a brilliant young man from Sweden, whom the court holds in high esteem. It is with such small steps one builds the rating future of a kingdom. The court may find it inappropriate, for the family of a general to be under your care. At least for as long as these rumors last. There is no further need for you to visit our residence. Lindgren will take care of the health of my wife and children. Gunter! Everything is normal. No need to worry. Good day, madame. Johan Anmuth would be prescribed red coral powder. Yes I know. But this time it's not necessary. I demand an explanation of your procedures, sir. You touched my wife. Please, trust my methods. It is only by examining the body, that we can sense illness or health within. This might seem rash, even sacrilegious. But the truth is, physicians are explorers. And the uncharted territory, is the human body, and it hides an entire universe. So like you sir, we courageously forging new paths. Do not speak of courage to me, I would be willing to believe you if it were not at my wife's expense. No offense, intended sir, but to fulfill my duties conscientiously, I must follow the procedures I believe in. I don't care about patients stories, I care about their organs, and how they are working, under the skin. I don't know whether you are outrageously impotent, or wise, beyond your years. Sir. Too deep. He will lose too much blood. We just need to cauterize the wound. I'll do it! Give me the iron. Please. Millette seed! Done. Cutting below the knee was the right thing to do. It lets the blood flow and, eliminates bad blood. Elisabeth, even the ground I walk on seems unsteady. Women are no longer in giving birth as nature dictates. Maria is among them. She speaks of the dead, as if they were seeds to plant. She feels the earth is a womb, nourishing every children who has ever died. Should such thoughts be given credence? Or be dismissed, as dangerous nonsense? Hi! I couldn't stop reading this. You came back. - Thanks for letting me take these letters home. - That's good. Yeah. Look. We're finally scanning the book. And the letters. And then, using algorithm, we can locate, search for, events, places names. Then we just compare the two sources. We have on one side the letters, events as they happen. And then the book, in the narrative form. The letters are incredible. They shine a completely new light on Anmuth's work. It's like studying anatomy through a poem. The book is the outword skin, and the letters are the beating heart. You don't know what your getting yourself into. Let's meet, at the agreed place, as we did before. I wasn't sure that I should come. I wanted to know how you were. I understand there's a new physician who will work by your side. Elizabeth, there's nothing you can do. My husband is not your enemy. I think perhaps I should retire as a physician. I'm with child. A month has passed since my last menses. He will be born in the summer. Yes, a boy. I can feel it, as I did before. I want to remain in your care. I want you as my confidant. - I can't. - Johan... I must go. How is Valentin? Well... his heads always in the clouds. He has such a beautiful mind. Valentin! Stay away from my son! You must never leave my side again! That is an order! - Why do you want me to cut down the tree? - Because the road will pass right through the woods. Be silent witch, or I'll deal with you myself! If you are not capable of looking after your own servant, I will. That witch is leading Valentin astray. Do you understand? Spending time with her is the last thing my son needs. The boy is easily influenced. His imagination is a threat, just like his mother's. At times, I barely recognize him. He is weak of mind. I don't understand what he's thinking. Everything seems to be... unclear. That what seems elusive to you sir, is for Valentin, only just out of reach. Have you ever tried to observe an object through a spyglass? You get too close, it's blured, confused, dreamlike. Try to observe the same object again from a distance, and you will see, that it takes form, and becomes clear. See Valentin, is looking there, far ahead. While you see only what you crush beneath your feet. Learn to look through a spyglass, Heinrich von Ouerbach, and then, you will see your son clearly. Ever since then, a part of me still dwells in her rooms. But I need to understand, why was Anmuth replaced by a younger doctor. And why did Ouerbach, who was his sponsor, stop supporting his research? It reveals the transition between ancient and modern medicine. The young doctor In England, who studied in Halle in Prussia, he came here with a new approach to medicine. He was crossing a border. And Anmuth on the other hand, he, he represented the past. And he didn't even believe in touching his patient's bodys. He believed in their stories, and he believed that their souls influenced their bodies. Let's study the letters some more. Something must be here. Why don't we talk about it more over a drink? Mmm hmm. - Hey! - Hi! I bought you a whiskey. Thanks. Thank you. Good evening. How's it going? We finally reached our jam session moment! Tonight is our Velvet Underground tribute. Anyone? I want to sing. Do you know "Candy Says"? Of course yeah. You sing, we'll follow. "Candy Says". * Candy says, * * I've come to hate my body * * and all that is required * * in this world * * Candy says. * * I'd like to know completely * * what others so discretely talk about * * I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly * * over my shoulder * * I'm gonna wat... * * What do you think I'd see * * if I could walk away from... * You can go home now. Your friend is asleep. She's fine. You should go and rest. Thank you. Welcome back. Here. I don't need to tell you, that fainting, is a symptom, of your condition. But if you're careful, we can keep it under control. Now aside from that, you have a difficult decision to make. Promise me you'll make it soon. Come in. - Hi! - Hi. You're not the first woman to faint in my arms you know. No flowers? I brought something else. - I'm really sorry. - No, don't be. I don't feel like talking about it. Look... I know I shouldn't... give this to you. But I just have to. - I have to go. - Okay. See you later. Thank you. Bye. Maria. Maria? Maria, is there something troubling you? Yes, yes yes yes... You sit there, Ludwig. Why so sad? My mother is dying. Let me be clear, I don't believe any of this nonsense, and I don't dare imagine where you get it from. But I will go to your mother. She may be irresponsible, but she is truly an unfortunate. But you can not make medical visits anymore. You may have not noticed, but Lindgren follows you like a shadow. To hell with Lindgren. Maria, I'm sorry, but your mother has died. I saw it in the glass. I want you to rest today. Don't do any work. Have you asked yourself who has the right to be in your book? The officer and his wife will always be remembered by their court portraits. And Ouerbach will be remembered as a benefactor, despite everything he has done and will do! The dead, like my mother and my child, will vanish into nothing. In times like these, it is more important to talk about the dead than about the living. Don't take peoples spirit away. - Talk about the living and the dead! - Maria please calm down. Nobody listens to me! I will die, without leaving a mark, because I have no history. Tell my story, and the story of the dead. Give us the soul that we deserve. Maria, I forbid you to leave the house! Sabbath lunch with the dean of medicine. I can't believe I convinced you to come. Well you did. - It's nice here. - Yeah. Well, this is a first. - Must be the influence of your friend here. - Dr. Morgan, this is Eva. - A pleasure. - How do you do? Come in please. - L'chaim! - L'chaim! So, Eva... I gather you have a research scholarship at our university. What is your chosen field? I used to be an oncologist in Holland, and, now I've decided to, explore the history of medicine. Interesting. Really? What a colossal waste. Why do you want to do that? Are we sentence to do the same thing our whole lives? 'Course not. Especially if you're dealing with idiots all the time. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I just don't understand why you want to immerse yourself in the past, rather than confront the challenges of modern medicine? Don't you ask yourself how far scientific progress should go? I just think, Eva wanted to express her own... Christ, Eva's perfectly capable of defending herself. You should be thinking of the future and how to deal, with the very real problems, we are face. Well I like to question the present, the past and the future, because I wanna know what made us what we are today. I know exactly what I'm doing. But I think it's really my own business. Usually, these lunches with professors can be quite stiff, but, I actually find this one, very entertaining. - Why? - You two, You sound like an old married couple. You were sparkling today. I wasn't trying to be sparkling. Usually I just, uh, try to play it smooth and, not get into arguments too early in the game. I like to watch the back and forth. Then I just jump in at the end of the match. But why would you hold back at all? Because then I can fool myself that I, know how to deal with things... on the surface. It's like surfing. It's the only way I can be myself with somebody I care about. With somebody who's worth it. Like you. Stop it. Very good, Stellan. Don't worry about it. Just my lucky day. Yeah. You have too many lucky days. I need to tell you something. First of all I'm sorry about the charade at lunchtime, with Eva. The point is, Eva is my patient. - Yeah I know she's ill. - Yeah. And she's also pregnant. Did you know that? - No. - No... no. She has to terminate the pregnancy, otherwise both her, and the baby, could die. And, I need you, to convince her that... Stellan! Stellan! No man can be sure of his true motives. I am no exception. I'm not conscious of my motives in writing this volume. A man may be gentle because gentleness pleases him. Another might be extremely wise because wisdom nourishes his soul. Yet another might be a martyr burned in fire, because his nature is to defy and to dissolve into the flames. When can we know that our motives are sincere? Only when our actions are not part of our nature. And how can we be sure that our actions are not within our nature? Only when we travel two opposite paths, at once. Maria, why don't you speak? I need you to talk to me, please. Say whatever you want to say. I will listen, I promise. When my mother, comes down, from the tree... I tell her to stop. She doesn't listen. She comes over to me. She whispers in my ear. She tells me of a tragedy... of a child... a little boy. Valentin. Burn it all! Over there too! Valentin! No! "The day the great tree was chopped down, Valentin Ouerbach, eight years old, died." "The deep waters of the lake swallowed his body." "Death occurred by drowning." Stellan! Stellan? What's wrong? What's wrong with you? I looked for you all day yesterday. And your phone was turned off. And you stole the book from the library. Are you crazy? I wanted to tell you. It's here. Something incredible happened. I dreamed the death of Valentin. I mean the book describes exactly what I dreamed. - You must have read that. - No! You've been studying this book for months. No I haven't. It's practically at the end of the book. What's going on? I don't think you should worry so much about dreams. You have bigger problems. Morgan told me. You're pregnant. Well that's truly my concern. No, not if you risking your life. My baby won't hurt me. I know that. We'll be fine. You're crazy. Valentin... My son's death described in every detail. How could he have written something like this? I think he's he's losing his mind sir. He gave credence to that evil woman. He started writing down her visions. How dare that witch insult me like... Elizabeth, go back to bed. It could be any moment now. What are you two conspiring about? How did you come by these? Pay it no mind, madam. There the words of a madman. Elizabeth? Elizabeth! My sweet... What's happened, mother? Nothing's happened. Valentin is not to leave the residence. And you... You're old enough to look after your brother now. Try to love him... Don't worry, mother. Do you think I can overlook what Anmuth has done? - I need to make an example. - Let me go. Elizabeth come here. Elizabeth. Elizabeth! I will not tolerate your behavior! Elizabeth? Servants. Servants! Please, breathe slowly. All those things we never said to each other, they're not lost. Every step, every error, every secret lead me here. I can not live... without your love. But you must. He's a beautiful boy. Just the way you imagined him. No, you can't go in there! It is by Decree of His Majesty King Fredrik Wilhelm, and by will of General Heinrich von Ouerbach, that the physician Johan Anmuth, be taken forthwith, to the Tecklenburg fortress, lunatic asylum. No, you can't do this! No, let go of me! - You can't! No. Lars! - Maria! No! Please don't hurt him! Please don't hurt him! - No! No no no no no... - Maria!! No one must see your behavior. No no... She's about to reach me where the shadows grow. The soldiers will say she died of fever. People who hate her will be glad, but no one ever truly dies. In any case, they've taken him away by now. Who have they taken away? Anmuth the madman. Mad like like Maria, whom you love so much. Maria is beautiful! The tree where you meet, is no longer there. That's not true! Please, after you. You can see for yourself. Keep your eyes open. Wide open. So wide that you hold your breath. No time, no space, no fear left. No fear left. Just a glimmer of understanding, as you walk down a new path. The baby's fine. But you'll have to have a C section. And before we get to that point, we have to do something about your heart. And the sooner, the better. Robot surgery will be less traumatic for you, but... it's pretty serious never the less. I'm not afraid... not any more. That's what happened between you and me. The things we never said to each other. They're not lost. Every step, every error, every secret brought me here. All that emotion somehow finds its way to other people. We will find our faiths, discover new worlds, find new people to love. I wish I had your strength, Eva. I'd be a better man than I am. This is an intolerable situation for you. You shouldn't be alone. I belong to you. And you belong to me. - I've been trying to call you. - Why? About Eva. She needs your support. - She lied to me. - But, she loves you, for God sake! What do you know about love? Alright. I'm going back to the hospital now. I'm gonna sit behind that machine, and do whatever I can for her. I don't know what's gonna happen, but what I do know, is that what I'm doing, I will do, with love. Now you can sit here feeling sorry for yourself, or you can play your part and share in the kind of love that's offered maybe once in a lifetime. If you're lucky! My dear Johan, I never could have imagined that a single day would encompass an entire lifetime. The same day my third son came into this world, they took you away, and Valentin was found dead, in the lake Tecklenburg. Nothing will ever be the same. I do not know how you were able to predict these events. I wish I had your strength. I would feel less lost. Where are your words now? My lord. Master Gunter. Forgive me. For you, mother. Mr. Morgan, we're ready for you when you are. My dear Elizabeth, a human being, even a mediocre one such as myself, can elevate his mind, to such a degree, as to perceive the world of the angels. And yet there is something in man, that strikes envy even in these beams of light. The ability to put our head in the clouds while keeping our feet, deeply rooted in the earth. My son Valentin, did not die. He's just standing up, on the tip of his toes, reaching for a new vision. And here I am. Good luck, little boy. Created by Dandysubs and cryinoutloud.
