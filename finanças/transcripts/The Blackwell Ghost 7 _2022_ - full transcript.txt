So, wouldn't you know it? Right after I buy the house, a pipe burst and the whole house floods so I had to remove all the furniture in here and all the carpeting It's been a nightmare. Still got a long way to go, but I've been down here for about two weeks doing some repairs to the place that need to be done. As far as updates go, no real updates with this house. I've been down here two weeks. Haven't heard any knocking, haven't heard any phone calls. Oh, the only thing though, I bring my keyboard down and I can still sometimes see who I think is my wife in the reflection of the door, which is really cool, but it's more seldom. And when I leave here, I actually will take this keyboard home and put it upstairs and I can still sometimes hear the notes playing themselves. But again, not anything like it used to. Just talking about it, it's making me upset. Honestly, that's it for updates. I don't really know why I'm even filming right now, other than the fact that I'm extremely lonely and I miss my children. That sounded really, really Pathetic and sad. I almost started crying myself. I gotta go home. I gotta get outta here. I miss my kids and just talking about 'em... All right, cut the cameras. So I left a house 10 minutes ago and my phone just let me know that I got a text from Officer Ramey. He tried to call, but I don't have any service out here. And his text says, "Call me, urgent." That's all it says. I've never heard that guy use the word urgent, so I'm definitely curious as to what is going on. Yeah? Hey, it's me. What's up? Are you still in Florida? Yeah, but I just left not long ago. - How long have you been on the road? I've been on the road for about an hour. Why, what's going on? - I'm gonna need you to turn your car around and come to my office right now. Okay, why? Is everything okay? - Uh, no, we've got a situation here. We want to show you something. It's pretty serious. Okay, it's gonna be like two hours. Well, I'm not saying to hurry, but if someone pulls you over, just tell them your name and they'll let you go. - Okay, I'll get down there as quickly as possible. Can you tell me what this is about? I'll tell you when you get here. All right, I'll see you... I'll see you when I see you, bye. All right, bye. What the is this all about? I like those cameras. I know that model. You want me to move it? I'm not in frame. You want me to move it for you? All right, there. Ramey, am I in trouble? You've got me nervous. Uh, no. We're gonna explain things here in a second. I just wanted to reintroduce you to Detective Barnes. Hey man, it's good see you again. He's gonna be the one heading up this investigation also with Officer Santos from the FBI who you have not yet met. Uh, did I do something wrong? Is this about my investigating of trying to find those people? - No, this is actually about something else. Okay. This note. Uh, this is actually a note that was left at a possible crime scene of a local girl, age 27, who went missing two days ago. Okay. This was found in her bed where she was supposed to be Sunday morning. Okay. I don't understand. - Well, could you explain who this is a picture of on this piece of paper? That's a picture of Mrs. Blackwell. - Right, so what we're trying to figure out is why someone would intentionally leave this for us to find at a possible crime scene. I have no idea. - It kind of involves you, wouldn't you say? - I mean, it's definitely weird that somebody would print off a picture of Mrs. Blackwell and leave it at a scene, but I don't... Yeah, it's weird. All right, well if you think of anything else regarding this, please don't hesitate to call me because you know, we think whoever did leave this did so on purpose. Okay. As some type of message. And we figured since you were already down here in Florida, you might as well come in and check it out for yourself. So that's where we're at. No, yeah, I mean... I'll do what I can. I don't know how much I'll be able to do, but I'll do what I can for sure. Definitely serious, right? The envelope it was in was postmarked February 14th, 2021, so I've had this thing for over a year now. - And you're telling me it's the same one that we showed you? - Man, it's exactly the same as the one you showed me. I'm looking at it right now. - Are you by chance touching this with your hands? Yes. All right, stop doing that. Now, you said you had the original envelope it came in? - Yeah, according to the post office stamp, it was mailed from a town called Reddick in Central Florida. And where there's supposed to be a return address, it just has question marks. - All right, don't touch it with your hands. Put it in a bag and send it to my office so I can run it for prints, okay? Can you tell me what this means for me? - I really wish I could man, but I can't. I have no idea what's going on. - So I figured I'd take a second to explain things because maybe things aren't clear up to this point, so I'll just try to clarify. So long story short, a girl went missing in Florida less than a week ago and they found this riddle slash puzzle, I don't know what it is, in her bed where she was supposed to be. A year ago, I got in my personal mail the exact same riddle or whatever it is at my house. And so I'm taking it to the post office right now to mail it down to the Florida, whatever. But you know, I'm creeped out right now because at the root of this, there really is a missing girl in Florida right now. And if the person who took that girl said this to me as a threat, it's not to be taken lightly. I think the biggest question I have right now is, why me? You know, maybe this guy's just a fan of my movies. I don't know. But then again, maybe I'm just overanalyzing this whole thing and I'm not really involved as much as I think I am. It's very possible that moving forward, I never see anything that connects me to this case ever again. I sure hope so. Hello? Hey, it's me. Hey, what's up? So I don't know how to say this, but I just got another package from your guy, if he is a guy. - How do you know it's the same person? Trust me, it's from your guy. So there is a piece of cloth wrapped in plastic and it's covered in what appears to be blood, which is maybe the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in my house, maybe my life. And another ransom looking note. Uh, what's it say? It says, "A gift for my new friend." Jesus Christ... - Should I call my local police about this? 'Cause this is pretty serious. - No, don't do that, I'll call them. I'll take care of that. I'll have an officer sent over to your house to look at it or pick it up. Uh, don't touch it. But you know, friend to friend, I gotta ask you a serious question. What? Do you own a firearm? Are you serious? That's the question you're asking me? I'm dead serious. Do you own one? Yes, I own a gun. - All right, when was the last time you fired a gun? Uh, when I was eight. Is your sister at school? Ya. You're sick today, you're not at school. You should be at school, buddy. You're making dad's work extra hard. So it's been roughly a 10 days since I got that thing in the mail, and shortly after talking to Officer Ramey, he had a local policeman come over and pick it up. So it's gone, but the damage had been done because it's all I think about every few minutes. And I shouldn't be. I don't think I've ever been this traumatized in my life and I've seen some. But moving on, come here, come here. Tomorrow's a very special day because it marks the first day I met this little guy's mommy, and so we're gonna go to the playground and have a good time and try not to think about it. Isn't that right? Hey, it's me. So I just got a strange looking email and I think it's from the guy. All right, what's it say? I'm walking to my car right now. Can I call you back in 20 seconds? Sure. All right, bye. So the email says, "From your secret admirer, I really admire your work. I hope that you admire mine. Link to a private chat room will be live at nine." And then there's a link to a private chat room. Man, I'm kind of freaking out here. I need you to tell me what to do. - How do you think get got your email address? I have no idea. Okay, well, let me call Santos and I'll call you right back, okay? Forward me that email right now. All right, okay. Bye. Man, I don't want to do this anymore. I'm getting really nervous. I'm reaching my boiling point here. Man, I'm getting upset. Hey, I'm here. Can you hear me? - Yeah, so I got Santos conferencing in. Okay. So what'd you guys come up with? What do I do? - Well, after talking about it for a little bit, we think it's in everyone's best interest if you do the chat. - Okay, I'm getting mad, I'm getting upset. Ramey, can I be candid with you for a second? And don't judge me on this, but what the man. I mean, I consider myself a nice guy, sometimes too nice. And when I get the sense that someone's mistaken my kindness for weakness, I blow the up, all right? And I get the sense that that's what's going on right now. You guys are using me. First off, please calm down. We understand there is a limit to your contributions as a private citizen, okay? Now, we can't tell you what to do, but listen. As your friend, I'm telling you I would never use you like that. We are only asking that you continue because you are so unique to this situation. We have a deranged man who has abducted a young girl and for some reason, he only wants to talk to you. Okay, I've never seen this happen in my entire career. And if you start to refuse or quit, you're either gonna piss him off more or you could get this girl killed if she isn't already. So how would that make you feel to think you had the opportunity to save someone, but chose not to? Hey mom. I don't want to scare you, but something's going on. And I was wondering if you could take the kids for a couple days. I don't want to tell you right now, but it's pretty serious. All right, thank you. I love you too. Bye. So it's just past eight o'clock and I decided to turn the cameras on just to give a little update because I'm all alone again. My kids are at my mom's house and I'm just sitting here looking at the clock go by, waiting for this chat to start. And it's just now starting to sink in what's about to happen. I'm about to have a conversation with a complete psychopath who's abducted a girl, sent me a bloody piece of clothing, and continues to harass me on a daily basis. So yeah, trying to relax a little bit, not going so hot. But a couple more of these, I'll be raring to go I think. You might be asking, a great question is why am I doing this? And one word comes into mind, and it's not hero. It's obligation. And I know that sounds terrible. And if the family is watching this, I'm so sorry. I'm trying to do everything I can, but man, that's gonna make me sound bad. Maybe I should cut that out. It's true though. So it says, "Waiting for host to initiate chat." So I guess we're just waiting for him to get on here. Can you both hear me? Yes. Are you guys recording this by chance? - Yeah. - Okay good, me too. I've got like five or six cameras going right now, so I hope I'm recording it. Wait a minute, it says host has joined so he's on here and he's typing. All right, he says, "Hello." Is it cool if I just wing this and go with it? - Yeah, go for it. - Okay, good. I'm just gonna reply. He says, "Have you figured it out yet?" Figured what out? "Who I am?" "Have we met before?" He says, "Not yet." You know, something just crossed my mind. This is kind of stupid. Is it possible this isn't even him? I mean, someone could have just easily stumbled across this chat room, right? Should I make sure it's our guy? - Uh, that's a great idea actually. "Just to make sure, what did you just send me in the mail?" "A piece of dirty cloth." Well, it's him. Ask him where the girl is. What's her name, the missing girl? It's Susan. "Where is Susan?" He says, "She is in a better place." Ask if she's alive. Okay. "Is she alive?" He says, "Not saying." Ask him about you. What? Ask him what he wants from you. "What do you want from me?" Wait a minute. Wait, he left. What do you mean? - I'm telling you, it says, "Host has left the chat room." He's gone. What did you say to him? I don't know. I just asked what he wants from me and then he left the chat. What am I supposed to do? Wait a minute, he sent me something. He attached a file, it looks like. Let me see if I can't open it up, hold on. Oh my God. What is it? Um, it's a picture of me. So I'm on my way to Florida right now because the picture the guy sent me was actually taken a few months ago. And I know this because I was down in Florida a few months ago working on the house. And every time I'm down in Florida at the house, I take a few hours out of my day to go out into the forest and follow the map and see what I can find. I followed the map from the house. I followed the map from the water tower. Hell, the cops even ran their own search for it. Nobody has ever found anything, except now this guy sends me a picture of myself looking for it during one of my last attempts. He says I should look harder next time. Nothing creepy about that, but it tells me he's found it, which raises the biggest question yet. How, how does, this guy know so much about this? Somebody out there knows more about this Lightfoot case than I do, and this is all I've been doing for the past like three years. And that pisses me off. So this is marker number two. I left this out here to act as a visual representation of spot number two in case I ever came back out here. According to the last clue, if I turn to a heading of 320, which is that way, and go 1100 heel toes, I should arrive to whatever this thing is. However, I've found in my past experiences that there's a difference between a heading and a course. Especially given the terrain and all the trees out there, it's almost impossible to end up where you intend. And out of all the times I've done this, I never ended up the same place twice. So that's why I tied the ribbons to trees so I could tell where I had been before. So we'll do this again and we'll hope for different results. So I just made it to 1100 heel toes and I'm looking around and as every other time, I see absolutely nothing. So we'll do it again. So I just got back to marker number two. We're gonna try our second attempt. I don't know how many of these I got in me because the sun's going down and... But let's go, do it while we can, right? All right, here we go. We're gonna come up on our final step here. I see a ribbon in a tree over there. So I've been here before, but other than that, I'm looking around, I don't see a God thing. So you know what that means? We start over and we do it again. All right, I'm on attempt number four here. So some people might be asking why I don't actually do heel toes like instructed by the puzzle. And it's because I did the math, and 1100 heel toes is roughly about 367 of my actual steps so it saves a lot of time and you don't look like an idiot waddling across the forest. Not like anybody's out here to see- I just found something. So this is what got me. This is what took my picture. And it says, "You got mail, 50 heel toes at 320," which is that way, so we're gonna go there. Found it. Found it. Hello? Hey, it's me, I think I found something. So I found the camera that took my picture. It's some kind of do it yourself trail camera. It's got an antenna on top. I think it's so he can watch these videos remotely. Is that it? - No, and then I found what he wanted me to find. It's a piece of paper in a glass bottle. What's on the piece of paper? I don't know, but I'm about to find out. Hello. I'm watching you. - So I'm back and we're here to discuss this puzzle. Now that I've got it scanned in high resolution, I can show it to y'all. There's really not much to it, as you can see, so we'll just start over here on the right side. There's this 10 sided shape, a decagon with a north and south as it's designated on the top and bottom here. And there's something interesting about the number of sides and the shape, and significant I believe as I'll explain and come back to here in a bit. But for the time being, we're gonna move over here to the left side where you can see this riddle. And the riddle goes, "If you're up the creek with a paddle, then you'll have an easier time discovering where they are buried, otherwise impossible to find. You can't get here by walking, so find another way. Only so many of these nearby where birds like to stay. If you figure out the riddle, you'll be on track to find my sins buried around a concrete headstone, which is one of a kind." So I broke each stanza down, took some notes, and this is what I've determined, whether it's right or wrong. We'll start with the first stanza here. "If you're up the creek with a paddle," keep in mind it's usually without, so with is a very important word here. "If you're up the creek with a paddle, then you'll have an easier time." And that to me means if you have a boat or a canoe or something with a paddle, it's gonna be easier to find whatever this thing is, which leads me to think that it has something to do with water, maybe. So moving forward. "You can't get here by walking, so, find another way. Again, this supports the idea that it could be water or boat related. Maybe you have to swim here, I don't know. But let's keep moving forward. "Only so many of these nearby where birds like to stay." Now, if you ask me, this is the most important part of this entire riddle, because it's the only line that doesn't have an obvious answer. Where do birds like to stay? I have no idea. A zoo, power lines maybe. There's no obvious answer, so that's what tells me this is very important to this whole riddle. But anyway, I don't wanna digress. Let's move on. "If you figure out the riddle, you will be on track to find my sins buried around a concrete headstone, which is one of a kind." So this is it, or at least it comes across that way because you never know when you're being misdirected with these puzzles, as I've seen before. But according to it, if it is true and it is solved, it should lead to the remaining victims of the Lightfoot case. And how do I know that is because the shape over here has 10 sides to it. It just so happens to be the exact same number of missing victims yet to be found in the Lightfoot case, so they correlate with each other. And it's hard not to get a little bit excited about that because it tells me this might be the final clue. That's pretty exciting. So now I'm on my computer and it's time to ask the internet for help. And as I usually would do in this situation, I would post the clue to social media and ask for help that way. However, I don't wanna do that this time out of fear that this guy could see what I'm trying to do, and I don't like that. So instead, I joined a private forum that has about 2000 members, all of which are amateur detectives, and all they do is try to solve cold cases. Pretty impressive what they've been able to solve. So right now, I'm gonna post my clue to their forum and see if somebody can't somehow shed some light on it. Hold on, I've got my camera rolling now. What is it? - It's a letter from the same zip code as the others. And what does it say? It says, "I miss my friend." Can we chat again? You think you're up for another chat? I'm ready for this to over, man. Can this be over? Oh my God. All right, so it just turned nine o'clock. He didn't specify what time, so I'm assuming it's the same as before, wouldn't you say? I mean, it's a guess. - All right, so I guess I'll just wait, prick. All right, he's on. He says, "Hello friend." Can I just do what I did last time and take the lead on this? - Go for it. - Okay. "You really consider us friends?" He says, "Of course,". Ask about where she is. "Please tell me where she is." He says, "I'm surprised you're still asking that question." Well, that means... That means we should maybe know where she is. That's a little funny. I don't know what he means by that. "You have a letter coming tomorrow. I suggest you do what it says. It says might be helpful." I guess he sent me a letter. "Thank you?" - Yeah I'm here, so what did you find? - Okay, I'm gonna read what it says, all right? It says, "To speed things up, to make you understand, I have decided to give you a hand. Go to this spot where you will find a pickle jar with something inside. If anyone other than you goes to the spot, I assure you that I will never be caught." Is that all it says? - Yeah, except for he gave coordinates to a spot, which is about 10 miles away from the Lightfoot House. So man, I'm so upset right now, but as much as I don't wanna do it, right now, I'll do whatever I can to get this caught. I can't look over my shoulder for the rest of my life. So if you need me to do this, I'll do it. Hey, can you hear me? Yeah. So I'm at the trail head. I'm gonna head on out if that's okay. And it's gonna be a while 'cause it's about three miles to the spot. All right, copy that. We'll keep our distance, but let us know if you need us to move in, all right? We've got eyes on you. All right, I'll call you if I need help. All right, copy that. See ya. Hello? Hey, can you hear me? Let me call you back on the landline. I'll call you right back. Bye. Hey, so what was it? - Well, you're not gonna believe this. - Try me, I believe just about anything at this point. So in the riddle he sent you, he said, "To speed things up, to make you understand, I've decided to give you a hand." Right. - Well, he wasn't being hypothetical. What? - Lab says it's been submerged in formaldehyde and judging by the level of decay, it looks like it's been in the jar for maybe years, decades maybe. Well, what is that supposed to mean? We don't know. I hate to have you stay out there by yourself tonight. Sure you don't wanna come to my place? Man, I wish you'd asked me that sooner. I'm drunk as right now. I probably shouldn't be driving. - All right, well I can have another officer stay on the main road tonight just in case, but call me if you need anything, all right? I don't care if I have to come all the way out there myself. I appreciate it, man, thanks. All right, see you later. All right, bye. No way. No way. Shit, it's dark. Well, it's getting late. I just wanted to come out and see the creek real quick. It's been a long day. There she is. All right, I'm going to bed. My cue to go to bed. Hello? Yeah? Hey, it's me man. So I don't know how to say this, so I'll just say it. He was out here at my house last night. How do you know that? - Because he left me something, a little box. Did you touch it? I did. What was in it? There is a severed human finger inside. Jesus Christ. - Also, a little fortune cookie looking note that says, "Too late, better luck next time." I'm done, man. I am done. He says, "I'm surprised you're still asking that question." That's a little funny. I don't know what he means by that. Ask him where the girl is. - What's her name, the missing girl? It's Susan. - So you said the name of the victim was Susan, right? Yeah. - He buried the bottle with my first kill Susan. Susan Forrester was Lightfoot's first victim. It just so happened to be the first body I found. You remember that? Okay, I still don't know where you're getting with this. - So during the second chat I asked him, I said hey, please tell me where she is, referring to the recent Susan, right? He said, "I'm surprised you're still asking that question." Okay? - It's not a coincidence that they have the same first name. It was a clue. So my question is, has anyone checked the site where I found Susan Forrester's body? Oh my God. That's what I said. Call me back please when you find out what is going on. - All right, I'll call you back soon. All right, see ya. Good evening. Breaking news as we come on the air tonight. A body was discovered this afternoon at an undisclosed location as authorities have stated that they will not be making any statements due to the situation being a part of an ongoing investigation. However, rumors have circulated that the body is believed to be that of 27 year old Susan McAllister, who went missing only a few weeks ago. We will continue to try and bring you more information as the story unfolds. - Please tell me there was nothing else we could have done. We did everything we could've, right? You couldn't have stopped him. He always knew how it was gonna end. You sure it was her? - Yep, positive ID from the parents, missing a finger. There was also a photograph sitting next to the body of him torturing her, so... Jesus Christ. Who is he, a copycat? Is that what you call him? - It would appear that way, except for one thing. What, what's that? - We checked the DNA of the hand from the jar that you found and we matched it to a swab taken from the clue you found in the wall. Can you repeat all that? I didn't understand a word you said. Pretend I'm a wasted three year old because I didn't get any of it. It means the hand from the jar is the same from the clue. What? Yeah? - Hey, so he just sent me a picture via chat. It sounds like it's what maybe you guys found next to her body today, but yeah, I just figured I'd let you know. All right, send it to my email when you get a chance so I can confirm that. Okay. You doing all right? No. - Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R. Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R. Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R. - "A group of us are still trying to figure out your puzzle, but the vagueness is throwing us for a loop so nothing new yet. I'm a big fan of what you're doing, so I'm staying on top of this personally and won't give up. Sincerely, Jordan." Hello? Hey, you got a second? Yeah, hey, let me call you right back. I've got my hands full, hold on. Hey, so what's going on? So you can't tell anybody what I'm about to tell you, okay? At least until we know it's for sure. Okay, what's going on? We think we have a suspect. Shut up. - The picture that he sent you last night through the chatroom is different than the one we found next to the body. Okay, yeah? - Are you by chance looking at the picture? No, I'm in my garage. Can I call you right back? I'll pull it up on my computer, hold on, hold on. Okay, so I've got the picture pulled up, but I don't see anything special about it. What am I looking for? - So look at the left side of the picture and tell me what you see, on the boat trailer. Oh my god. Exactly. We were able to run it and even with only four characters, we know exactly who it belongs to. We're planning to pay him a visit first think tomorrow morning to ask him how his license plate ended up at a crime scene. Dude, I think you got him. - I'll call you back when we find something. Like I said, it'll probably be tomorrow morning. But until then, don't tell a soul. I promise, I won't tell anybody. All right, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later. - All right, cool man, I'll talk to you later. See you, bye. Hey, I just had to pull over and start the cameras. Will you repeat exactly what you just told me? We got him. And you're sure it's him? Oh, it's him. We arrested him this morning, dead to rights. Found all sorts of stuff in his garage, like pictures and pieces of bloody clothing, that license plate. Absolutely no doubt it's our guy. Oh my God, this is awesome! Did you see the guy, did you see him? - I was the one who read him his rights. Shut the up! Shut up. What was he like, was he scary? - No, he actually came across as very nice, a gentle older man. He's in his 70s. What did he say when you confronted him? - Well, he acted like he had no idea what we were talking about. His wife claims he suffers from schizophrenia. And honestly, based on first impressions, I thought we had the wrong guy. You know, when we opened up the garage, there was no denying it. Well man, you just made my day. Thank you so much for calling me. This is fantastic news! Thank you. - Well, I wanted to be first to let you know because, you know, you deserve it. And I swear we may have never caught him if you didn't keep stepping up, so... Well, I appreciate that, man. In all honesty, I'm just glad this is all over. Well hey, we're pulling up to the station right now so I gotta hop off here. I'll talk to you in a bit, okay? All right, cool man. Hey, good job, I appreciate it. Hey mom, you're not gonna believe this. They caught him. So I'm gonna come over to your house and pick up the kids. All right? All right, I love you. I'll see you in a second, bye. My day just got a little bit better. Wow! Wow, it's over. And at the root of it, a 70 something year old man. What the hell is that all about? Oh my God. Well, it's over. I don't care. All right, rolling. So I'm sitting here looking at all the footage I've been shooting over the past few weeks, and I'm starting to quickly realize that there's very little ghost activity. But you know, at the root of it, it was just too interesting of an experience not to film. So I filmed it and this is what I got. It's basically gonna be a movie about a man who terrorized me. But you know, now that he's been caught, I hope to go back to what I like to do, which is I hate to say a ghost hunt. But if somebody asked me, you know, if you didn't get a chance to film any of this crazy stuff that happened, would you be upset? And my answer will be no, because I'm just that happy that things can finally go back to the way they were. I'm just glad it's over. It feels good. Hello? Hey, it's mom. Hey mom, can I call you right back? I'm in the middle of filming something. Yeah, that's fine. But I thought I'd let you know, I was just at your house just to pick up the kids' laundry and I noticed there was a letter taped to your front door. - What kind of letter, from the HOA or something? - I don't think so, it has a question mark on it. Okay, I'm heading home right now. Stay away from it, don't touch it. "As you read this letter, you'll feel the fear progressively grow as you come to realize the game isn't over, that your strings were pulled like a marionette by a master puppeteer who now considers you his favorite puppet. So a riddle for my new friend to hold you over. Did you know a father can be a father, regardless of law, regardless of genetics, regardless of all? What makes a father can be an opinion one sees because to me, a father is a father who did what he did for me. He loved me enough to put a gun to his head, to write a letter to say what he said, to let them know it was him and not me because that is what he wanted them to see. So a wrinkle for your brain as it is about time, the puzzles and murders you thought were my father's have always been mine." - Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R. Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R. Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R.
