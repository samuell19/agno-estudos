(FIREWORKS CRACKLING) (SOFT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (OMINOUS AMBIENT MUSIC) ADAH: Amelia, thank you for agreeing to do this interview. AMELIA: Thank you for coming. ADAH: Thank you. (EXHALES) I'm a little nervous. ADAH: Really? How so? Cameras, people watching, kind of feeling the pressure, you know? What I actually mean is some people may be asking how it's possible for you to even feel nervousness considering what you are. How did you feel when you realized that you were no longer human? (EERIE AMBIENT MUSIC) ELLEN: What we're working on is going to change the world. PAUL: Scientists have known for years that the human brain is essentially an electrical device. COMPUTER: Beginning data stream in 10... (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) COMPUTER: Seven, six. PAUL: That's where our memories are, everything about us. Our hopes, fears, dreams. (BABY GIGGLING) COMPUTER: Six, five, four. Transmitting neural impulses from the brain is nothing new. This, this is the next step. Containing those connections. We can't return life that's already lost. (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) But, we might be able to intercede before the moment of death and rescue a person's consciousness before it's lost forever. (VOICES CHATTERING OVER EACH OTHER) If we can do that, then that is the key to living forever, to saving those we love. To saving those who leave us too soon. That's what we're trying to do. Every day we learn new ways to conquer the limits of the human body. We're approaching new worlds, new frontiers, and new possibilities for life. And I will tell you, we are already looking forward to the students, to the pioneers, and the breakthroughs yet to come. Each day we hear new ideas, see new projects, and we meet new heroes. Here's to building a better future. Here's to building better people. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Dad used to say that life was like a light switch. You die and you're just turned off. I don't think he was ever afraid. What do you think? Still not used to it, you know? Just... Tell me what you need me to do. AMELIA: Stay safe out there. AUTHOR: Here's the thing, Adah, there's no such thing as the natural order of life. You're saying in your book that transhumanism is humanity escaping the bounds of the human body, but again, keep in mind we're talking to everyone that has the main idea that humanity is having flesh and bones, being human itself and having a physical body. AUTHOR: Everything that we engineer, everything that we do... For lunch there is celery. You need to tell that partner of yours that he's a bad influence on you. Gotta keep you lookin' good, mister. CARTER: Mm-hm. Maybe I can just call in sick to work and... You know, one of these days I got to tell Amelia I need more calories than a ham sandwich. VAUGHAN: Enjoy it while it lasts. Still have things about each other you don't know. That's not true, Vaughan. Carter, I've been married since college. You got five months tops, right, and then she accidentally leaves the bathroom door open or forgets to flush. Next thing you know, seven years go by and you got a mortgage. She starts talkin' about kids. You guys have talked about that, right? Yeah. I mean, not recently. (VAUGHAN LAUGHS) What the hell's so funny. Oh, it's comin'. Oh, welcome to the club of former honeymooners. You better start picking out baby names. Until then, enjoy this time. I am. And you know what, I'm actually looking forward to picking out baby names. (VAUGHAN CHUCKLES) I am. DISPATCHER: All units be advised, reports of a mentally unstable man on Lily Boulevard. Can I get a responder? So much for lunch. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) (OMINOUS AMBIENT MUSIC) Are you okay, Mrs. Summerland? Did you forget something? Yeah, my tablet. AMELIA: Yeah, right. Sir? VAUGHAN: Sir, I need you to take your hands out of your pockets. CARTER: It's a beautiful day, don't ya think? Look, take it easy, okay? (HIGH-PITCHED DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GLASS BREAKING) (HIGH-PITCHED SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) MAN: Why didn't you shoot me? It's all right. It's all right, it's over. You all right? I'm gonna need you to put your hands behind your back, all right? Amelia! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (SIRENS BLARING) AMELIA: Carter. (RAIN PATTERING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) So, Andrew's leaning up against the bar, now bear in mind he's really drunk right now, right? And this woman, she saddles up next to him and she says, "When a woman asks you" "how old you think she is, take your best guess" "and subtract by 10." And Andrew here just goes, "I did." (GROUP LAUGHING) Hey, Carter, we're heading to the Starlight tonight if you wanna come. Yeah, I'll see. Tell her hey for me, all right? (DOCTORS AND NURSES CHATTERING) (MACHINE BEEPING) Hey beautiful. Brought you flowers. I missed you. Got big news today. It has been exactly six months this week since I stopped energy drinks and I've been taking lunch to work. Mostly. (PHONE BEEPS) (PIANO MUSIC) I thought it was good! - Really? - I liked it. You couldn't have, you fell asleep. It was, I... (AMELIA LAUGHS) But before that, before I fell asleep, I thought it was fun. (LAUGHS) For three minutes? CARTER: Uh-huh. So, what else do you wanna do? When you're not ticketing adorable women for going five over. (LAUGHS) Adorable, huh? And smart. (LAUGHS) Okay. And funny. - Uh-huh. - Yeah? CARTER: Uh-huh. What do you do? I don't know. Really? Come on. There's got to be somethin'. Maybe a little street piano playing? (PIANO MUSIC) No, I could never really push a piano down the street. Ha! They are heavy. Just sayin'. All right, okay. So you're not very strong, I got that. (LAUGHS) How about something you can do or that you like to do. Anything. Something. How 'bout I show you? Okay. What's that? Jesus. Thanks for answering your phone. I thought you had plans tonight with the guys. Yeah. How are you? I'm great. I paid off another installment. I applied for the Wesley grant. I'm using my site to raise donations. Oh. Thought you said you were two months behind on your house. Yeah. Amelia's got maybe a few more months, maybe. But there's still time. Look, Carter. I know it's tough to let go, I get it. If there's anything you need, let me know. I need more time. Every day we learn new ways to conquer the limits of the human body. We're approaching new worlds, new frontiers, and new possibilities for life. So, while I thank you for this award I will tell you, we are already looking forward to the students, to the pioneers, to the breakthroughs yet to come. Each day we hear new ideas, see new projects, and we meet new heroes. Here's to building a better future. Here's to building better people. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) ADAH: Of course I can't believe it. Paul Wesley. Well, congrats. Well, thank you. So, Paul Wesley, when are you gonna start returning my phone calls? When your show stops pandering to corn fed housewives. Tell you producers to reach outside the box they're in. - Ooh, ouch. - Ow. I was referring to dinner, but I think I'll rescind the offer. Good to see ya, Adah. Take this. Yeah. I'm on a flight in 30 minutes, Ellen. What have you got? ELLEN: I think we have a candidate. The leukemia patient? No, he's made a full recovery. That's unfortunate. Amelia Summerland, age 26, coma patient. Aneurysm two years ago. Diagnosis of Locked-in syndrome. The brain is fully intact but much left on her body. She's married? Yes, Carter Summerland. I'm sorry, do I know you? I'm Paul Wesley. I believe you applied for one of my grants. We need to speak to you immediately about Amelia. Any other family members our lawyers have to worry about? She's an only child. Her parents are deceased. Mr. Summerland, do you know what a non-disclosure agreement is? Yeah. Good. Sign that. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) PAUL: Max, just in time. MAX: Mr. Summerland, nice to meet you. Max Parker, lead robotics. We're excited to show you the lab. Right this way. COMPUTER: Now entering cyber level four, section D. All right, all non-essential personnel, clear out. Carter, I want you to meet Dr. Ellen Beckett. Very nice to meet you, Mr. Summerland. Dr. Beckett is the chief neurologist for Wesley Enterprises. She's been studying Amelia's scans. Most coma patients have seen significant deterioration by this point. I think there's a wonderful chance that your wife is still in there. Dr. Beckett is the main reason we've made such progress in brain injuries over the past 10 years. You can fix Amelia? Better. Mr. Summerland, I'd like you to meet Cindy 69. Go ahead, touch her. This is the latest generation of the Cindy 69 companion robot. My design. Max, couldn't you have brought down one of the elderly assistance models? MAX: But Mr. Wesley, this model has the latest biosynthetic flesh, state of... COMPUTER: Online. That feels real nice. MAX: Sorry. CINDY 69: That feels real nice. Okay, sorry. - That feels real... - Sorry about that. I didn't think she was activated yet. I don't understand. I apologize, Carter. Max's social skills aside, you can tell that this technology is indistinguishable from human flesh. Mr. Summerland, we can help Amelia by putting her brain into a new body. Into that? We can build an exact replica of your wife. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Wait, Mr. Summerland, we can help you. You wanna help me? Put Amelia in a better facility. Find me someone who understands Locked-in Syndrome. But that? It's not even human. We have artificial hearts, artificial hips. We've been replacing worn out parts on ourselves for the better part of a century. You can't tell me that's the same thing. Mr. Summerland, can I put it another way? Kim. Okay, say I wanted to replace the front end of this pen. I take it off, put a new front end on. Ta-da, there's my pen. But wait, what if I want to replace the other half of it? No problem. I just unscrew that, right? Screw a new backend on. There's my pen. Uh-oh, but look, here are the two pieces that I replaced. If I were to put these back together... Would that be the original pen? Or is that the original pen now? Hm? Do you get it? You've agreed to complete secrecy. You discuss this with anyone, the offer's off the table. (MACHINE BEEPING) (OMINOUS AMBIENT MUSIC) I once had a daughter. In five seconds I went from driving her to school to a bed just like this one. We chose Amelia because she's young. Her mind is healthy and we know when and how she's going to die. We're offering you the chance to see her, to hold her again. CARTER: If I say yes, what happens? PAUL: You would sign power of attorney over to Wesley Enterprises. You would give consent on your wife's behalf to this procedure. When your wife passes away, they take her body. She gets officially donated to scientific research, but we stay discreet. We then preserve her brain and begin a process we call mapping. How long does that take? We need to acclimate her to a new body and she'll require therapy, physical, mental. It's gonna be some time. (SOFT AMBIENT MUSIC) (MACHINES BEEPING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) PASTOR: We ask that you comfort us in this time and for the future. It is with our faith in you that we commit her body, her heart, her being, into your hands. (THUNDER RUMBLES) Insiders suggest something big on the horizon for the multi-billion dollar research facility. Many may remember Wesley Enterprises was in a similar situation just a few years ago. AMELIA: What else do you wanna do? When you're not ticketing adorable women for going five over. This isn't just Wesley Enterprises playing it safe. We've seen literally everything from this company. Solar powered blankets, mission heat tiles, robot sex toys. I think it's safe... MAN: To expect the unexpected. Is Paul Wesley sparking another scientific revolution? We'll just have to wait and see. (REPORTERS CHATTERING) REPORTER: And we say they fear what they do not understand. Talk about some of the good that Wesley Enterprises... (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) (PULSATING MUSIC) PASTOR: It is with our faith in you that we commit her body, heart, her being, into your hands. Into your hands. AMELIA: Hello. (WOMAN CRYING) VAUGHAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Step away from each other. CARTER: Hey, that's enough. Back off. Hey, hey, hey, hey. VAUGHAN: You back up and stay there. Don't move. - You back off, asshole. - Do not move. (FIST THUDDING) Oh my God! Hey, what the fuck is the matter with you? (CARTER GRUNTS) Hey! Get in the car. AMELIA: I wrote a poem. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) What about the soul? What about the fact that we are created in God's own image? Quite frankly, I'm shocked that a Nobel Prize winner like Dr. Beckett would engage in work that seems to suggest that being human is nothing special. Which on the face of it... Actually, Senator, I think human beings are extremely special and worth saving. Senator, if someone has early stage Alzheimer's, then if the technology that she advocates becomes reality, it could save them, correct? I believe there's a reason why we don't live forever. We're not meant to. Human beings weren't meant to fly either. We weren't meant to travel in space. We weren't meant to talk to each other from across the world. - Doctor... - Dialysis, heart transplants, bypass surgery. You're familiar with that one, aren't ya, Senator? Well, since I see you wish to make this personal, I'd just throw that question right back at you. That's a good point, Dr. Beckett. Many are familiar with the tragedy that took your daughter. Are you saying in theory you'd really be willing to replace her this way? Don't you think as her mother that might cheapen her memory? If you see what we're doing as Frankensteining someone. Which is absolutely - not the case. - That is exactly what you're doing. We are talking about transplants. The idea behind the technology that God has given us? That's not the problem. But with what some people might do with it. This theory - that Dr. Beckett... - This is not a theory, Senator. This will happen. You will see us save someone's life with this technology. And you will know that we did it and not your God. That did not help us. These people don't care about science, Paul. We're trying to lay the groundwork here to gain some credibility. You can't go off book like that. Since when did credibility involve arguing with the right? That's the conversation you shouldn't be having. It validates their opinions. MAX: Dr. Beckett, you need to come downstairs immediately. Why? Her patterns spike when we speak directly to her. Watch. She knows that I'm speaking specifically to her. Amelia. (ELECTRONIC BEEP) Ellen. Paul. Max. Amelia. (ELECTRONIC BEEP) Okay, let me try something. Hundreds of years of research and discovery and the fix might be as simple as a light bulb. What are you talking about? Voltage. COMPUTER: Activity increase. Consciousness to level six. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Beginning voltage increase in 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Subject is online. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Amelia, can you hear me? Do you know where you are? Do you know who you are? Can you tell me your name? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I'm Amelia Summerland. (DOCTORS CHEERING) MAX: I know, I know, I know, I know. Wait, wait. Quiet, quiet everybody. Oh shit. Heart stop. Heart stop! - Stop it. - Get a hold of her. (DOCTORS CHATTERING) You're safe. You're safe, Amelia. You're safe. You're safe. (PULSATING MUSIC) MAX: We've lost everything. We need to tell her. She won't be able to handle it. It couldn't possibly be worse than the episode we just had. Blunt her emotions. It'll keep her calm. So, um, what that means, Amelia, is that you will never age. You'll never get sick. You'll never die. You're still you, Amelia, but... You're different now. Tell me what you're thinking, Amelia. Who are all of you? Wesley Enterprises experienced a record low last quarter but remain optimistic. Insiders suggest something big... PAUL: I want to announce it. She's not ready. She's talking, for the love of God. She struggles with motor control. She can't walk without assistance. Her nervous system is a disaster. The interface, it overclocks. The computer can't keep up. She's had several catastrophic failures. When the computer resets, we have to completely rebuild. We're six days from an update with the board. We have to make something up. How long does it take to rebuild? Weeks. I mean, it's not a simple. 23 hours to be - precise. - Process. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put her back on line. I'm letting Carter meet her. It's too soon. We have to have something to show these people. Imagine how they're gonna react when they see Carter reunited with his dead wife. The emotional stimuli might cause another failure. We have to do something. What about Carter? I'm worried what that might do to him. I'm worried about keeping this project funded. (EMOTIONAL MUSIC) (PHONE BEEPING SOFTLY) PAUL: Carter. Amelia. You have a visitor. (SOFT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (COMPUTERS BEEPING) AMELIA: Hello. We'll be right outside. (SOFT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (COMPUTERS BEEPING) Do you know what they did with my ring? Your ring? It's been missing since I woke up. (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) They wouldn't let me see you. Why not? They said there's things they don't want us to talk about yet. They said it's the only way that you'll get better. Am I sick? Not anymore. Then why do I need to get better? Millie. (HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) There's something in my ear. I can feel it there. I'll talk to the doctors. My ring. Can I have it back now, please? Of course. (SOFT MUSIC) I never stopped believing. I don't understand. Who are you? (ALARM BUZZING) I can feel my hand stall now. Really? (ALARMS BLARING) What? Somebody get in here! MAX: Get back. Move! CARTER: Tell me what's happening. (AMELIA CHATTERING) MAX: Get her legs. Don't worry, Carter, this has happened before. ELLEN: Get her to the chair. MAX: One, two, up. CARTER: Tell me what's happening! ELLEN: Mr. Summerland, you need to leave. Mr. Summerland, you need to leave now. What are you doing to my wife? (DOCTORS CHATTERING) What are you doing to my wife? ELLEN: Get control of her, Max. I'm workin' on it! (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) (SOFT AMBIENT MUSIC) (STATIC CRACKLING) (PIANO MUSIC) (MUSIC WITH CHANTING) (PIANO MUSIC) Don't look. We noticed when Ellen would play Mozart over the intercom your brain activity would spike. So, we figured this might help you redevelop some of those broken connections. And this little present. This is a textbook example of art meeting science. When Dr. Beckett developed microbes that specifically target cells to help them grow, this was the first clinical subject. This plant hasn't aged in over a decade. So it's... Real? Absolutely. But just, you know, not all of it. I guess it's like you. Like me. You are Amelia. I don't remember if I played. Oh, don't worry. It's easy, here. We're just gonna do the basics. I'll show you. Come look. This is C. Go ahead, play it. (C KEY CHIMES) What are you feeling? Nothing. Okay. I'm gonna try something different. You're gonna feel something completely different, but it's a good feeling, so don't worry, okay? COMPUTER: Emotions processing unit reacting. MAX: Okay, play it again. (C KEY CHIMES) (SOFT AMBIENT MUSIC) That... is beautiful. Okay, play it again. But take it easy, okay? Your mind's trying to catch up. (C NOTE CHIMES) That's music. (C NOTE CHIMES) (SOMBER MUSIC) It wasn't my decision to introduce her to you yet. She wasn't ready. We found the problem and fixed it. CARTER: Why isn't she moving? She's in standby mode. Unaware of anything around her until we give her the verbal command to wake up again. It's like sleeping. - No. - Carter. You have her on a remote control? It's not like that. This isn't right. She was at peace. Carter, please, please. I understand. I really do. It looks very strange seeing her like this. Where is your daughter now, Ellen? (SCOFFS) I beg your pardon? Where is her body? Carter. Where is she. In the ground. (SOMBER MUSIC) Where is Amelia? Find a different test subject. You know we can't do that. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Wesley Enterprises, the tech giant positioned in Cedar Rapids, Iowa... Shocked the world today when founder Paul Wesley announced what he says is the first successful copy of a human brain. This will give new hope to Alzheimer's patients, to parapalegics, to those suffering from terminal illness. Our Amelia is the future. Wesley released no images of Amelia, but promised to unveil her publicly three months from now. Wesley's announcement sent shock waves through both the medical and religious communities. Protestors rallied outside the capital calling for strict legislation... That clearly defined the definition of human and machine. Proponents of the new technology suggest current definitions are vague and open to interpretation. My colleagues, it would be foolish to suggest that the world would be better off without technology. Without our advanced care for the sick and elderly. But these technologies work in harmony with the human spirit, not against it. These are gifts from God and if we attempt to escape from these gifts, to reach higher than we were intended to reach, we will have become arrogant and foolhardy. MAN: Hi, Carter, this is Senator Williams office. We received your message. We'd like to speak with you as soon as possible. (AIRPLANE ENGINE ROARING) (PIANO MUSIC) More of her memories are turning but four weeks to play Twinkle Twinkle? I am sorry, Max. Oh no, no, no, it's not your fault. Don't apologize. The important thing is that you're making progress. And that is good? It's very good, Amelia, considering most of what you remember was left in fragments. We have the data here showing you're making huge strides. Yesterday you told us a story, the one in the park. Do you remember? Yes. (PULSATING MUSIC) I'm by a lake. I jump in. This other man does, too, but I can't remember his face. Some kids nearby are laughing at us. (SOFT MUSIC) My face is underwater. I can feel summer. Now we're sitting under a tree. I'm reading a poem to the man, something I wrote, I think. I can't remember his face. We're walking through a garden. There's a (MUMBLES) dance by. I don't understand why. There's a feeling of happiness. (MUMBLES) A girl walks in, she... ELLEN: I want you to keep thinking about that, Amelia, that exact moment. Everything is blurring together, Dr. Beckett. Where is the ring? (HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING) The screeching... sound. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Warning. (ELECTRONIC BUZZING) All systems offline. MAX: Well, it's very strange. ELLEN: It's too unpredictable. There's nothing about what she remembers that makes any sense. She needs information. She doesn't know what to do with the information she has now. Just keep her playing scales. Understood? Understood. COMPUTER: Build. Good morning. (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) That's one of the few advantages being a computer has over humans. The dreams, they're more vivid, right? (AMELIA GRUNTS) Yeah, your mind is more free to create than an organic one. In fact, if I hadn't fixed a small glitch, your brain wouldn't be able to distinguish dreams from reality. Incredible, right? Look at this, look. See that? Every time I look at these scans, I see growth. Very important. Look at all this growth, all these new connections. It's amazing, actually. Looking at the mathematical equivalent of your mind. You can see my thoughts? It's like looking at, like a jpeg in binary. Yeah. Do you know, when I was working on my thesis years ago, I spent two years with a neurosurgeon. He likened the brain to more of a plant than a computer. He said the task of making a mind had nothing to do with making it smart. You had to make something that was capable of growing on its own. Like, even something so simple as a tree or our flower. It's infinitely more... (SOFT MUSIC) Hello? Hey? (CHUCKLES) You're not paying attention. Sorry. Max, can you tell me something? MAX: Sure. Am I still able to be a wife? Yeah, of course. I designed your body to be 100% functional for sexual activity. You did? Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Yes. (AMELIA GIGGLES) I used to head up a love robot project. Can you believe that? I couldn't help but pour a few things over. There's some things you're gonna have to do to, um... prep the system, kind of. Ah, can we talk about something else? I guess having children is out of the question? Yeah. THADDEUS: How long were you married when it happened? CARTER: Three months. Hm, well, any time is too soon, but that is unfortunate. CARTER: She had an aneurysm. It broke the connection to her spinal cord but not enough to damage the brain. I thought they could just repair her. That's what they promised you? CARTER: Not the way I thought. Hm. Well, Sam. Well, you're right to be angry, Mr. Summerland, but for the wrong reasons. I want you to meet my chief policy officer and advisor. Sam. Sam Patterson is an old friend and he and I have followed Wesley's developments for quite some time. Hi, Carter. The senator sent me your message. I'm sorry to hear what's happened here. This is why we have been on this from the start. Carter, did they ask you a lot of questions about Amelia? Of course. Did they ask you for photographs of you together, private journals? Photos, yes. Journals, home movies? Yeah, whatever I could get my hands on. They said it would help return her memories. Is this a deposition? Are you familiar with spiritual mediums? Excuse me? They use techniques to fool people. They say general things like, "I see a person dying" "from the chest," ooh. Well, most deaths do occur, statistically, from the heart, so it's not a bad guess. But not to the person who just lost a father to a heart attack. It's emotional manipulation. Carter, what they've built? It's not your wife. It's an imitation. You believe it because, well, you wanna believe it. They're counting on people to react that way in order to sell what they wanna sell. Immortality. People will pay ungodly amounts of money to have a chance to fly in space. You think they won't pay at least a million for this? Carter, most live their lives day to day, like you I imagine, until something happens. You're dancing through a big beautiful field and then suddenly a snake jumps out and bites and the reality of our fragile lives is suddenly exposed. We run to the one thing that we understand to be true. Well, I don't know what's true here, but I know what's not. For now, you can fix this if you help us. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) If Congress passes the Humanity Act it will become illegal to copy or sell any element of the human brain for monetary gain? Correct. I think the most obvious critique of your viewpoint is that it forbids others from making a choice. It's a false choice. It's something that takes advantage of people. Mr. Summerland can speak to that. INTERVIEWER: Mr. Summerland? What she is now, it's not her. They took my wife. Carter, you said that they took your wife. I assume you signed consent papers, did you not? She was dying. I didn't know what to do. I think that most people would question why you signed in the first place. Well then, you have no idea what it feels like. We need to change the spin on this. I got a call from Adah Allen's producers this morning. They want a one-on-one interview with Amelia. No way, absolutely not. (SCOFFS) Of course you're okay with this. We need to get ahead of William somehow, otherwise... We are not having this conversation again, Paul. In 12 years you have not ever once rushed one of my projects, ever. Which is why you need to humor me. For 12 years I funded this humanitarian work. Don't make this about the goddamn money, Paul. I've given you a full staff with technicians for four years, not to mention the cost with prototypes and materials and security and mark... The work we are doing takes time and you need to respect that. We don't have the luxury of time. Paul we are making progress, but you... No, Ellen! Do not destroy this. PAUL: Just get Amelia ready. CARTER: Got big news today. It has been exactly six months this week since I stopped energy drinks. And I've been taking lunch to work. (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) I had... another dream. Okay, why don't you tell me about it. I remember Carter. I remember everything. (MAX EXHALES) It's all come back. Everything. Okay, wow. Wow! Okay. I need to leave this place. I need to find my husband. Okay, shh, shh, shh. Okay. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (SIREN BLARING) (PILLS CLATTERING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (PHONE CHIMING) (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE CHIMING) Hello? (EERIE MUSIC) Carter? Yes? Where are you? Um... Carter, why haven't you been to see me? I miss you. I love you. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (PULSATING MUSIC) COMPUTER: Beginning security lockdown. (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) ELLEN: You are not allowed to do that. What do you mean I'm not allowed to do that? Just like I'm not allowed to contact Carter? God, what is wrong with you people? You can't just keep me here. (RANDOMLY PLAYED PIANO NOTES) She doesn't log in again for any reason, do you understand? I'm sorry, but how much longer can we keep her here? You know what would happen if she got out there. She doesn't have rights. Will you stop that, please? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (CHATTERING ON TELEVISION) I don't have rights? Amelia, you scared me. Can you appreciate the magnitude of everything that's going on here? Now, you're saying that electrical impulses in the brain... Oh, God. I hate television. I have to boil down everything, all of the work, research, nuances, discoveries, everything into something so completely basic. It's stupid. But you know what? It worked. How? (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Every day we learn new ways to conquer the limits of the human body, and yet there are still so many barriers to cross. Goddamn it, Paul. How do you feel about going on national television? Convincing the world of what you are is the first step toward your independence. (SOFT MUSIC) Okay. We're very excited to introduce you, you know? And, like magic, there she is. Adah Allen, I want you to meet Amelia Summerland. (ELECTRONIC ZAPPING) Hello, Adah Allen. Paul, what is going on? You know what, maybe we should not do this today. (MAX AND AMELIA LAUGHING) I'm totally messing with you. Totally messing with you. Hi, I'm Amelia. It's so nice to meet you. COMPUTER: Decontamination complete. Welcome to my home. Your home? AMELIA: Well, yeah, for the time being. We have every intention of returning Amelia to her life once testing is finished. I think if you interview Max and Ellen with Amelia alongside and then do some demonstration... Yeah, that'll be a part of it, but I want to talk to Amelia directly about her life now and about Carter. No. I told you we can't do that, not with a pending lawsuit. The viewers wanna know. We need to show the full Amelia. The story is about Amelia, not the legal case. Exactly, the story's supposed to be about Amelia. Her own husband doesn't wanna talk to her, Congress is debating whether to shut this program down. Come on, how do you expect me not to talk about that? That topic is off limits. There's no point in us being here if we don't get this. No, you're trying to paint some conspiracy here, Okay, Paul you're wasting our time, and I'm not gonna let you. And painting a fake picture of your corporation is the least of my concerns. And above all... Quiet! You've actually talked to Carter? We thought that was information best kept for later. This is why you blocked my network access? Okay, enough. She's not doing this. You're concerned about some soon to be forgotten lawsuit and we have the most advanced scientific feat right here in front of us. We're concerned about whatever Amelia is concerned about. That's what the people want to see. I want to talk to Carter. Amelia, do this interview and you can tell Carter whatever you want. Well, I guess it's in your hands, Mr. Wesley. Get out of my way. DIRECTOR: Roll open. Stand by to dissolve to one after the open. ANNOUNCER: Challenge, inspire, inform, and heal. It's Adah Allen Live. Amelia, thank you for agreeing to do this interview. Thanks for comin' here. Thank you. I am nervous. (CHUCKLES) Really? How so? Cameras. People watching, kind of, um, feeling the pressure, you know? What I actually mean is, some people may be asking how it's possible for you to even feel nervousness considering what you are. How did you feel when you realized that you were no longer human? Kind of a loaded question, don't you think? Why? 'Cause it assumes that I believe I'm not human. Yeah, but you are not flesh and blood. No, I'm not. But human means different things to different people. I would agree, actually. I would. So, then I'm gonna rephrase that. How did it feel when you realized that your old body was gone? Conflicted. It was... shocking to not have a heartbeat. I didn't really like myself at first. But then I remembered that I spent two years in a hospital bed watching the world go by. It's like I was dead already. So, to have a new body... And to be able to speak again. It's just this huge gift. I'm sure it is. But I think you would agree that there are going to be people out there that are going to have a challenging time in accepting you for who and what you are. Some are calling you a sin against God. And that's a direct quote from Republican Senator Thaddeus Williams. - Really? - Yes. (CHUCKLES) Guess I'm not votin' for him next fall. (WOMEN LAUGH) ADAH: You have a wicked sense - of humor. - I do. I would say that a great sense of humor definitely makes us human, and certainly makes you human in my opinion. But I'm gonna change it up a little and ask you about your husband, Carter. AMELIA: My husband's been through a lot. ADAH: Well yeah, but to be fair, you've both been through a lot. THADDEUS: Goodnight. And the last time he saw you you had quite a catastrophic meltdown. I don't remember any of that. From what I was told, the reason you don't remember is because the physical components that house your memory, they literally melted. And so, I think this is where people are gonna struggle with the idea of you. As human as you are and as humorous as you are, but on those physical levels, see you as only a robot and that you are not the real person that you quite represent. Yeah. What do you say to people like that? I'm not an expert on spirituality, Adah. Or medicine. I taught fifth grade. Then one day everything just stopped. (AMBIENT MUSIC) But one thing got me through. My husband never gave up on me and every day I knew he would be there, holding my hand, playing me music. Reminding you of who you were? But still, your husband, as dedicated and devoted as he is, is also going through his own emotional and moral struggles with what you are. And consequently, who you are. And I know that's got to be heartbreaking. So, if Carter were here, looking at you, and you can look back into his eyes, what would you tell him? Carter, Carter it's me. It's me. Amelia, are you up to sharing with us what you've learned? Now? Please. (TRANQUIL PIANO MUSIC) I read your offer. I don't think I understand. They dropped the restraining order, so you can see her, and if Amelia convinces you that it is she, you drop the suit? Carter, in the three days since that interview, complaints are flooding our offices. The Humanity Act may not even leave the Senate. Things are very precarious right now. And you drop this bomb? I understand your objections. Do you understand this, Mr. Summerland? I have cancer. I may not last out my term. I didn't know. Of course you didn't. There was no way you could've known. I haven't even told my family yet. If I did, my family would want me to consider the Wesley procedure, so don't just stand there and think it's all about you. If you don't help me put a stop to this, Wesley Enterprise will continue to commit this sin. Again and again! Senator, I'm aware of all that you've done and I really can't thank you enough... Yes, you can, by being true to your word. I made a promise to Amelia. A promise to Amelia? She is not real. Look, I can not stand here as a man of God... To hell with God. All right. This how you wanna proceed? I can not support you, I'm sorry. This isn't political, Carter. It never is. You people are ones to talk. Listen... You're here because you know instinctively that you need to defend something valuable and precious. But you don't know what that thing is, Carter. I know exactly what it is, Sam. Amelia Summerland. That's the face that it takes for you. For me it's my son. I see God every time I look at him. Other people, it's something else, but it's the same inside. You need to ask yourself this, how can you truly help Amelia Summerland? And others? (PULSATING MUSIC) Senator? Come with me. Excuse me? If we go there together and I prove to everyone she's a fake, wouldn't that reverse what's happening right now? I don't even know anymore. CARTER: Well, if that's the case then it doesn't even matter. Listen, you're upset. You're not coping well. It doesn't matter what the truth is. You're gonna believe it no matter what. Well, I could say the same thing about a lot of what you preach. (THADDEUS SCOFFS) (SUSPENSEFUL AMBIENT MUSIC) How are you feeling, Amelia? If you could see your daughter again, someone like me, what would you say? I don't know. (PIANO MUSIC) ♪ Ooh ooh ooh Carter, good to see you again. Senator, I'm sure you remember the terms as well as I do. I hope you remember all the terms. He gets as long as he wants in there with her. No television crews during, no technicians, just the two of them. Of course. ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh You look different. Where have you been? I, uh... AMELIA: It's okay. I had this entire page written of what I was gonna say to you. You kiss like she did. Carter. They were so thorough. Your breathing, even that little scar on your lip. I don't know what you are, but you aren't Amelia. I am Amelia. No, no, Amelia, my wife? Had a soul. I have a soul. (CARTER SCOFFS) You know I do. Part of you still believes. Do you remember the day at the lake? When you asked me to marry you? As if it was some ordinary question. I thought that maybe you just didn't want to be romantic, but then I realized you were just actually really, really nervous. I bet that all was in your journal, wasn't it? I don't know. I bet Dr. Beckett knows. I bet she could find the exact page. All those things you said in the hospital. Our song. Our song that Dr. Beckett knew full well about. I played that song for you! Amelia couldn't play the piano! You know what, I can't take this. I'm stopping this. No, no, no interference. - This is bullshit. - That was our agreement. Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me, look at me. I'm different now. (AMELIA EXHALES) Why did you let them do this? CARTER: I'm sorry. Just tell me what you need. I know you're not her. I am. But when I look at you, it's almost the same. If I did it long enough, I bet I could - make you her. - I love you. I love you. I miss you so much. Can't that be enough? Oh, I wish it could be. (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GUN FIRES) (HIGH-PITCHED MUSIC) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I love you, Millie. (GUN FIRES) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) What happened to Amelia and Carter was a tragedy. Is this gonna hinder further research? Well, I can't speak for Paul Wesley and the company for legal reasons, but I fully intend on continuing the work that, as I've stated before, will save millions of lives. (AMELIA GASPING) COMPUTER: (MUMBLES) is online. Shh, shh, shh, shh. (AMELIA BREATHING HEAVILY) Max. Amelia. What happened? Where's Carter? Okay, calm down. I'm gonna fix everything, but I need you to calm down. (CRYING) These, these aren't my hands. Amelia, a lot has happened. Listen, calm down. What are you talking about. Okay, um... Do you remember when Dr. Beckett said that she'd let you go if you did the TV interview? Um, everything, it's so foggy. It's foggy because I had trouble porting you over. Listen, you did the TV interview and then... Carter, um... He didn't show up. And then Dr. Beckett changed her mind. She said that she wasn't gonna let you go. She changed her mind. She did? But I'm gonna let you go. I transferred you into a new body. In this body you'll be free. You can survive on your own. I don't know what's gonna happen to this company, but... All that matters to me is you. You can come with me. You're unlike anything I've ever made before. Okay, I'm, uh... I got to wipe some records, okay? I'm gonna wipe them and I'll bring clothes. There were redundancies. Everything about Amelia can be reproduced and fixed. Her mind essentially remains intact inside the mainframe, right up until the moment before the accident. So, we'll just pick up right where we left off. I've never given up hope for this project, never. Henry Ford once said, "If I had asked people" "what they wanted, they would've said faster horses." What Amelia taught us is profound. COMPUTER: Accessing visual records. (STATIC BUZZES) The product isn't immortality as we once thought. What people want is a higher quality of life, not necessarily a longer one. People love the idea of Amelia and that's when it happened. The idea. A whole new line of personal companions. We can use Amelia's brain to create a custom designed version of her. It would look, sound, feel like her, have her personality. But the customer can program her memory. They can literally make Amelia theirs. INTERVIEWER: What do you have to say to proponents of Thaddeus Williams? It's okay to be scared, right? PAUL: I would simply offer my condolences. MAX: What did you see? Everything. I'm sorry. I didn't want anything to do with it. Please come with me, please, please. We can run away you and I. We could have the life you never had. We could adopt. Could you please just give me a minute to change? Sure, just hurry up, okay? We don't have a lot of time. INTERVIEWER: Dr. Beckett, what are you feelings of Wesley's new announcement? I'm sorry? INTERVIEWER: A press report this morning announced a production line of customized Amelias. What are your thoughts? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Amelia Summerland, humanity's first and quite possibly last, embodiment of such an awes inspiring question. What is consciousness? COMPUTER: Erasing back-up files and redundancies. ADAH: And does the ideal of consciousness evade death and all its uncertainties? Does the power to live devalue what it means to live? And just because we can, does it mean we should? AMELIA: These fragile moments slip us by, one day at a time, memories may dry. But hold my hand and let's sleep tight, with open arms embracing with all our might. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) When the wind takes us past we no longer have such time to pass. COMPUTER: 1,000 (MUMBLES). AMELIA: We all will falter, we all will fall. But nothing is ever lost after all.
