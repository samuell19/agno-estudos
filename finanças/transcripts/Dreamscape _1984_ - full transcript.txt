John! John! John! John! John! Are you all right, sir? Yes, I'm fine. Is there anything I can do for you? Should I call your physician? No. Good night, Fred. Good night, Mr. President. There he is, Alex Gardner, when he was 19 years old. I worked with him for a year and a half. He was an authentic genius, this boy. Exceptionally gifted. Telekinesis was only one of his talents. I remember reading about him. Caused quite a controversy at the time. Then, in the middle of it, he disappeared. Yeah, he ran out on us. After months of intensive parapsychological testing. Didn't like being poked and prodded. Who does? He's perfect. I want him. Yes, you're right, of course. He would be perfect. If we can find him. You leave that to me. If he's alive, I'll find him. And they're off. Brightly Blue takes the lead, Admiral's Runner is second, then Completely Fine third, followed by Cover the Bet, Heavy Rains and High Compression. Around the turn and breaking away down the back stretch. Brightly Blue in front by a neck, Completely Fine second, followed by Admiral's Runner third. Then it's Heavy Rains, then High Compression, begins to move up making the turn for home. Here comes High Compression. It's High Compression now pulling away. High Compression at the wire. And in a stunning upset, the winner is High Compression. I like Benjamin Franklin. He discovered electricity, you know. Get him! Damn! What the hell are you doing in here? Are you some kind of pervert or something? It's not safe in the damn toilet anymore. Come on, sweet. - Hello, Alex. - Hi. Looking for me? You know, you could really hurt a guy's feelings the way you've been trying to avoid me and all. We don't see you around the track that often, when we do, you're always calling them right on the nose. So I'm lucky. Not today, pal. I can see we're going to have to teach you a little lesson about sharing the wealth. If you want to stay healthy, you and me are going to be partners. All right. Look. Look, want this? It's no problem. Shit! Get the son of a bitch! Hi. Nice ride! - Watch where you going! - Ah, piss off! Shit! See you later, partner. Thank you very much for joining us this afternoon. Hope you've had an exciting day at the track. Hi, Alex, it's Nancy. We met at the China Club. Do you remember? Call me. Alex, it's Eddie. I've gotta get your bets down for the weekend. Call me, huh? Alex, this is Maggie. I don't want to see you, I don't want to talk to you. We're through. Alex, it's Maggie. Call me. Mr. Gardner? Oh, no, wrong guy. Gardner lives... We know you are Alex Gardner. Who the hell are you? We're from Thornhill College. I'm Roy Babcock. This is Gary Finch. We have a little proposition for you. Yeah? - A chance of a lifetime, right? - Good. Depends on you. Oh, yeah. Well, come on, I think we'd better move in the car, okay? Hey, listen, guys, I've thought this over, and I'm not really interested. Why don't you just let me off at La Cienega, okay? I know this is going to sound a bit sinister, Mr. Gardner, but we have instructions to bring you back with us. You mean I'm being kidnapped? Well, there are some people up at Thornhill that are anxious to meet with you. Yeah, well, what would you do if I just opened the door and jumped, huh? I guess I'd have to stop you. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. - Hey, answer me something. - If I can. - Am I in any danger? - Not from us. Oh, I get it. My mother put you up to this, right? I've got to finish college or else. Sign in, please. Wait a minute, now. I'm not signing anything, here. I don't even know what this is all about. - Well, we can let this go. - Yes, sir. Go ahead. Just have a seat. Someone will be with you. I get the feeling he knows we're here. Hello, Alex. I am Dr. Jane DeVries. We're glad you could come. Ah, perhaps you can tell me what the hell I'm doing here. We wanted to talk to you about the project that we're working on. Yeah? Do you have a think tank full of geniuses who want to try out a new theory? No. Well, look, I'm sorry, but I hung up the psychic bit when I was 19. Well, that's fine, because we're not interested in parlor tricks here. What are you interested in? Dreams. Dreams? Why the watch dog? You got something to hide? We're a little cautious. We want to keep things to ourselves for a while. Oh. Shh... This is our sleep-monitoring station. - Hi, guys. - Hello, Doctor DeVries. These individuals are under observation because of the frequency of their nightmares. This man is in REM state. - Rapid... - Eye Movement. When dreams occur. Right. I mean, I know one or two things, Doctor DeVries. I have some more things to show you. So, what goes on in this section? Well, one of our areas of research is sexual dysfunction. If a man is experiencing impotency, we can determine whether the cause is physical or psychological by monitoring his sleep. Mm-hmm? How's that? Well, if it isn't physical, he'll experience three or four erections during the course of the night. I see. So, Jane, what you do here, in effect, is count boners. I can see you're going to be a real challenge to work with. Oh, wait a minute, Doctor. I haven't agreed to anything yet. Doctor DeVries, may I speak to you right away? All right. I'll just be a moment. Hello, Alex. You're a bit late. Novotny, I should have known. You're nine years too late. You left me sitting in Chicago with an overheated bio-feedback machine. I got tied up. Well, I didn't mind too much that you walked out on me, you could have at least let me know you were alive. I was worried. About me or your research grant? Both. I would apologize, but... we both know I'm not very good at that. That's okay. It's a long time ago. It's good to see you. It's good to see you, too. Do you think next time you could spare me the cloak-and-dagger act? Oh, you mean you would have come if I just called? No. Nice place you got here. Who's your decorator, Darth Vader? Come on, we need to talk, Alex. How about some dinner in the Village? A couple of drinks, okay? All right. But before you spring for the check, I just want you to know, I have no intention of spending the next six months with electrodes wired to my ass. Don't worry, Alex. I can always have you dropped back into your life of playing the horses and hustling the women. I wouldn't dream of standing in the way of anything that important. You sound as if you don't approve. You're damn right, I don't. You've got tremendous gifts, Alex, and you've chosen to piss them away. Anything else? No. That's it. Come on. Let's eat. Anything else? - Let's play a little game. - All right, it's your party. Let's pretend that a man, with a little help from science, could psychically project himself inside the dream of a sleeping person. Okay, let's pretend that. Then, pretend that once inside the dream, he could become an active participant in it. Hmm? You could actually be there, right in the middle. You could feel the dream, experience it. Even shape and alter the dream itself. Hmm? What would you say to a notion like that? That it's crazy. You see, we've done it, Alex. Not once, but three times. Using two men with abilities in telepathy, just similar to your own. Going into another person's dream? I might have to see that to believe it. Not very much to see. Just two men with their heads wired up to a machine. Because the real trick takes place up here. That piece of science fiction hardware you got, that's the hook up, right? That's right. But all the machine does is help connect your brainwaves with the dreamer's. But, hopefully, once you get proficient at dreamlink, you won't even need the machine. Why me? Why you? Because you have a head start on the rest of us mortals. You can already work your way into the conscious mind. When the conditions are right, maybe with a little help, you could also get inside the subconscious mind. To the Dreamscape! You got two guys that have already done this? You'll meet them. Look, Alex, you don't have to decide right this minute. Spend the night here. Sleep on it. Give us a chance. Buddy's vital signs are increasing. Is it serious? They're escalating. He seems to have a tough time, poor kid. And Simms, how is he doing? Beginning to show signs of extreme agitation. - What's his blood pressure? - 200 over 174 and rising. Pulse? 145 and rising... 147 now. Brainwaves? Erratic. Let's pull them out. No, not yet. Let's see what he does. How is the boy? Pulse rate extremely rapid. It's rising fast. - EEG? - Erratic. Something's wrong. I'm bringing him out. Buddy, wake up! Buddy! Buddy! Buddy! It's okay. It's okay. What's going on inside that kid's head? What in God's name is he so frightened of? Rise and shine! Morning! What time is it? It's early. How did you sleep? Have any dreams? Do you mind if I take a leak before I give my deposition? No. Sorry. Force of habit. Mm-hmm. Do you want to explain last night to me? You saw one of our psychics, Edward Simms, dreamlinking with a young boy who has been suffering from chronic nightmares. And I don't know what demons that boy has inside, but... they were certainly too much for Edward now. I think I'd have to be out of my mind to hook up with that machine of yours. I think you'd be out of your mind not to. Well, okay, there are risks, but I think they're controllable. What's the point of it? Look, I'm going to level with you. I'm doing this because no one has ever done it before. No one has even conceived of doing it before. The simple fact is I'm doing it because it's exciting. I got to admit, it sounds tempting. But I don't think I can get back on that merry-go-round with you. Well, I... I tried. I think you could really have helped this project, Alex. Too bad. And I'm awfully sorry about this IRS business, too. What? Oh, maybe I didn't mention it to you. But, you see, while we were searching for you, our government sources took quite an interest in your gambling winnings, and I think the IRS is figuring on about a 5-year audit. What? What? If you could see your way clear to join this program, I might be able to do something about it. Novotny, you dirty son of a bitch, there's no way you're going to blackmail me into this. You understand that? I'm never going to do this for you. Not this way. No way! You understand? Never! Green. Uh, green. Blue. Blue. Yellow. Ah... Red. You're not concentrating. What's the point of this? I've done it a million times. You've got to sharpen your psychic abilities. You'll have to learn to reach a meditative state in which your mind can conform with the dreamer's. Green. Yellow. Yes. Yes? Yes. I find you attractive. That's just what you were wondering, right? That's what you were thinking. Knock it off, Alex. I'm not going to have you start trying to play mind-reader with me. Well, how else do you expect me to warm up the old whammy, huh? Why can't you take this more seriously? For once in your life, try to use your gift for something positive. Yeah, right. The old God-given gift, huh? Everybody deserves a piece of it. Okay, Doctor Deep Freeze. Let's get on with it. You play music with this thing? That's a matter of opinion. Who the hell are you? Tommy Ray Glatman. Oh, yeah. Paul told me about you. You're the Neil Armstrong of dreamlinking, right? Right. Just like walking on the moon. Yeah? Careful in that? Fit okay? You bet I can score heavy in a coat like this, huh? Yeah, I bet. Listen, I want to put on some clothes. Want to go out and have a couple of beers? Why? I don't know, I just thought maybe... I know what you want. I knew it the second I saw you. You want my secrets. No, I don't. I just want some advice. I don't give advice. I'm in this with me, myself, and I. That's it. Sorry. Novotny gives me free reign. You know why? Must be your sparkling personality. 'Cause I'm the only guy, Alex. I'm the only guy who can do it. What about Edward Simms? They had to carry him away in a basket. Now, well, Novotny seems to think I'll be able to do it. I'll order your basket. He's ready, Doctor. - Alex? - Hmm? Just remember that the first time out, all we want you to do is make contact, so once you get inside his dream, you're an observer, not a participant, okay? Sort of a cerebral Peeping Tom? That's right. Bill Hardy has been a good test subject for us before. Oh, he's a steelworker. I'll probably wind up in some bad beer commercial. You'll be fine. Paul... Once you get me in to this thing, just make damn sure you can get my ass back out. We'll get you out. Hardy should be entering REM stage shortly, Alex. You can begin your deep breathing now. Hardy has entered REM now. How is Alex? Emitting a good regular alpha wave pattern. He's ready. Stand by. Project. Hey! Hey, look! Look out! Look! Help me! Help! Hold on! Give me your hand! I'm slipping! I can't hold on! Help me! Hold on! Don't let me go! Don't... Easy now, Alex. Easy. - Paul! - Welcome back. It was incredible! Wait, wait, wait. Get this shit off of me. It was so damn real. - Real? - Yeah. You remember anything? - Yeah, we were on a skyscraper. - Uh-huh? Alex and me. A girder broke away. I was there! I was there! I want a CAT-scan and an EEG on Alex first thing in the morning. Okay? Hello, Alex. Hello. I'm Bob Blair. I thought it was about time we met. What do you have to do with all this? Oh, I just run it. For the government. Hold it. Novotny never said this was a government project. Novotny was absolutely right not to. We don't particularly want our involvement in this advertised. Well, excuse me for not shaking hands. Hey, I'm through here. Would you mind unstrapping me? I'm afraid I can't help you there. You better wait. A nurse will come along in a minute. Alex... I just wanted to extend my congratulations to you. They told me about your successful dreamlink. Well done. Thanks. This is only the beginning, you know. We all feel that the possibilities for our program are tremendously exciting. But we've got to see that you don't jeopardize the wonderful work you've already done. I don't follow you, Bob. Well, you have been playing it a little fast and loose since you got here. Those unauthorized visits to the dream chamber, for instance, that's a bit sneaky. Now, I'm afraid that's got to stop. Your work here is completely confidential. I'd feel a lot more comfortable knowing that you understand that. I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you could find someone to get me out of this rig. You wait right there. I'll get you a nurse. Yeah. And, uh... Thanks. Hi! How are you doing? Good. Oh... Is it the kid I saw linking with Edward Simms? Yes. His name is Buddy Driscoll. What's his story? Take a look at these. He's tormented by recurring nightmares. The little guy is terrified of going to sleep. He's on the verge of a complete breakdown. There's not a damn thing we can do about it. You mind if I talk to him? Oh, I wish you would. All right. Buddy, I'd like for you to meet a good friend of mine, Alex Gardner. Hey, Buddy. Are you a doctor, Alex? Who, me? No, no, I'm not a doctor. I'm just staying here, like you. How are you doing? Not so good. There's somebody in my dreams. Oh, yeah? Who? An awful ugly monster. Yeah, a monster, huh? I'd punch his lights out, but he's too big. You'd punch his lights out, huh? Sure, I would. Keeps making me miss Little League. Yeah? Well, you know when I was a kid, about your age, still a kid, but I mean, I used to have bad dreams. - You did? - Yeah. Yeah, I found that if I could talk to somebody, it made me feel a whole lot better. So, that's what I want to tell you, is that if you ever want to talk to somebody, talk to me. Okay, Alex. What do you say, we get you back? I'll come with you. Let's turn this train around, here. Why? Why did you do it? It burns. What did we do? Why did you do it? Oh! Oh! - Dad! Dad! - It's my fault! Dad, it's all right. It was just a dream. I can't stand this. It gets worse every night. Ever since mother died... Watch your step, sir. Welcome to the western White House, Mr. Blair. How is he, Fred? As well as can be expected. I know he'll be glad to see you. Bob! Thanks for coming. It's been a long time, Mr. President. Yeah. Fred, give us a moment alone, huh? Sit down. Relax. Ah, damn! It's good to see you. Well, we've been through a lot together, haven't we, you and I? Fought quite a few battles. Let's talk about those nightmares. They're getting progressively worse. It's terrifying. I haven't slept in weeks. And your doctor? Oh, they're useless. It's beginning to affect my job. That's the real reason you're here, isn't it? I'm... I'm here because I'm your friend. One of the projects I've been overseeing concerns the foremost specialists in dream research. I think they may very well be able to help. I'll be honest with you... I think there's a reason for these dreams. What do you mean? It's my responsibility to bring the world back from the brink. This nuclear madness has to end. I've decided to lead personally the delegation to Geneva next month. John... You can't be serious. No, no, no. I know you're against me on this. But I'm going to make a disarmament deal with the Russians. One thing at a time. Our first priority is your peace of mind. Peace of mind! Who the hell ever has peace of mind? I just want the damned nightmares to end. That's what we all want. If you'll allow me... I think I can help. How often does this occur, Mrs. Webber? About twice a week. I wake up in the middle of the night to find George gone from our bed. And every time I find him in the same place. On the front lawn, in his pajamas... calling my name. When she... When Melanie wakes me up, for the life of me, I can't remember what I was dreaming. All I know is I have this terrible feeling of anxiety. The neighbors are starting to think that George is a little crazy. Have you been under any unusual pressure? No. Not really. What about at home? How are you two getting along? Well... If you're referring to our sex life, George has been having a little problem lately. But... I feel certain that's just a passing thing. Isn't that right, honey? Oh, yes, sure. Absolutely. I'm just a little drug down, that's all. Is there any pressure at work? Well, whatever Webber's dreaming is the key to all his problems. I'd say whoever sold him that toupée is the key to all his problems. They gave the position to another... If you could go in, Alex, and observe his dream. That would be your first practical application of dreamlink. When do I go in? How does tomorrow night sound? Fine. EEG, stable. Alex is ready. Webber? He's in REM sleep. Good. Alex, stand by. Ever been married? No. Well, it's no picnic, let me tell you. You have to keep your eye on them every minute. My house is the next one down. I don't want to give her any warning, know what I mean? Now, here's the plan of attack. You go in through the back door, and I'll go in through the front. And, remember, no prisoners. Right. You scared, kid? No. Well, let's go. Hurry! Hurry! Go ahead! Come on! Oh, my God! George! And with my own brother? Hi, George. And in front of the children? I see you under there! Come on out! Phil! Dave! Herbie! Some golf buddies you are! Good God! Aw, knock that off. I'm Jewish. So sorry, Mr. Webber. You, too, Fukuda? What do you think? It's very simple. Mr. Webber has been repressing a deep-seated inferiority complex, complicated by feelings of sexual inadequacy. In other words... He's worried about who's stooping his wife. Well, at least, now we know what we're dealing with. Well, look, now that you've shed some light on Webber's case, maybe you can help me with one of my problems. Oh, sure. What's that? Buddy Driscoll, the kid with the nightmares. Yes? I want to go in. That's impossible. I've already lost one psychic over this, Alex. I don't understand this. This kid is being eaten alive, and nobody gives a damn. Oh, listen, that's totally outrageous. I'm sick that we haven't been able to help him. Well, then, let me go in. I mean, look, if our research here isn't designed to help a kid like Buddy out, then what the hell are we doing, huh? I will not destroy this program by going too fast. You see? I either go in with Buddy or I'm out of the project. Then, you're out. I'm not kidding around here, Paul. Either I go in or I'm walking. I know I can help this kid. You're a bastard, you know that, Alex. I'm doing this against my better judgement. Thanks. Don't thank me. This isn't my idea. - Drink? - Sure. I don't have to tell you... could be in for a rough ride. I know that. Just tell me what I can do to help. There is a tribe in Malaysia called the Senoi. The dream people. They believe their dream lives are just as real as their waking lives. The children are taught to never lose control in a nightmare. They've got to face their fears and conquer them. And I think that's what you have to do to help Buddy, Alex. Whatever his demon is, you have to help him face it. Okay, Buddy, you're all set. - Can I talk to him? - Sure. - Hi. - Hi. Feel sleepy yet? I guess. - But... - But what? But I'll have to dream, Alex. Yeah. You want to know a secret? I'm going to be there. You are? Yeah. I really am. Okay. If you're going to be there... Got something else for you, too. Thanks, Alex. Eh... Alex, stand by. And project. Buddy. Buddy, what are you doing? Are you the babysitter, Alex? I... Yeah, I'm the babysitter. 'Cause most of the time they just leave me here. You don't have to be afraid. You know the Snakeman? The who? The Snakeman. Snakeman? What do you mean, like the Boogeyman? He's outside, and he wants to come in and get me. The Snakeman! Oh, hey, hey, hey! I'm not going to let him get 'ya. Just let me see who it is, all right? Please don't answer it! It's probably not even him. You see? There's nobody there. Are you sure, Alex? He's always there. Alex! That's my dad. But he won't help us. Little bastard's right. Come on! Come on! Stop it! Stop it! You can do it! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him, Buddy! Yes! Do it again! Good! The head! Hit him in the head, Buddy! Now! Do it now! He's gone! He's gone! We killed him! We killed him! We sure did, Buddy. We sure did. We did it. He's gone. You did it, Buddy. You killed him. Even the Presidency, it seems, is not exempt from the flu. The President has retired for a few days to his California retreat to recuperate while he prepares for the Geneva nuclear disarmament conference. White House Press-Secretary James Nichols announced today the President will personally lead the United States delegation at the conference, which is scheduled to convene early next month. In an 11th-hour-compromise late last night, the Legislature passed a fiscal blueprint that called for more than 600... What are you, a cartoonist? Uh, no. I... I met this thing in a kid's nightmare, and it scared the hell out of me. Yeah, I heard about that. You got these jerks thinking you can walk on water. Probably think that makes you a pretty important man around here. Almost as important as me. Well, don't worry, Tommy. You're still number-1 lab rat. This thing really got to you, huh? You might say that. Hello, Jane. Hello, Alex. I'm, um... going to the Village for a bite to eat. Interested? No. Thanks. Found a wonderful Italian place, they make great Linguini. Sorry. I've got a pile of paperwork to get through. Maybe I'm going about this all wrong. I like you, Jane. I like you, too, Alex. You do? But there are two reasons why I'm not going to go to bed with you. Bed? Bed? Who said anything about bed? I'm talking about Linguini here. I just thought I'd save you some time. Okay. Since we're being so honest, why not? First of all, I don't want to join the ranks of your conquests. You're not a conquest. It's not the way I feel about you, Jane. Secondly, I don't want to jeopardize our working relationship. This program has got to come first. Okay. Friends? Friends. You treacherous! I'll bring you back ravioli. To go. You work with Paul Novotny? Paul who? Right. "Paul who?" Charlie Prince. Well, hello, there. Could we catch another beer for the Monsignor here? Thanks. You know something, you look familiar to me. Uh... I know I got one of these damn things in here somewhere. You write these horror books? - Yeah. I'm the one. - That's great. What are you doing here? - Research. - Yeah? Yeah, I'm working on a new book. It's got to do with dreams. Yeah? Sounds like another winner. Look, I know what's going on at Bates Hall. I know all about this dreamlink business. I know you're part of it. You know as much as I do, don't you. Maybe I know more. Look, you got a point to make here? Because I sure wish you'd make it. I assume you've run into a top, smooth, corporate-type name, Bob Blair. You want to guess what he does? He's with the government. He's more than just with the government. He's one of the most powerful men in it. Head of Covert Intelligence. Presidents come and go. Bob Blair remains. Yeah, well, if he's so powerful, then, what the hell is he doing wasting his time on dream research, huh? Consider all the deep, dark secrets that people hide away in their minds. Now, those secrets are bound to come out in their dreams, no? It occurs to me that a technique for plumbing those secrets could be of enormous interest to certain intelligence groups. - Good idea for a book, huh? - Yeah. Still, you know what they say is stranger than fiction. Excuse me just a moment. Jane? Jane, you there? May I have your ticket, please? Thank you. Jane! Jane! - Wait! Wait! - Don't touch me! You had no right to do that. Look, I'm sorry. I really am sorry. Maybe I was a little out of line. - Oh, maybe? - Look. All right. It just happened. What can I say? Was it so awful? Well, it depends on the way you look at it. I mean, it was just a dream, so it didn't really happen, did it? - No, it didn't. - So if it didn't really happen, then I shouldn't be upset, should I? But I am upset, damn it. I can see that. I'm sorry. You know, it would help a lot if you wouldn't be so goddamn apologetic and go back to your usual insensitive self. Alex, what you did was wrong. But it doesn't take a genius to realize that what happened in the dream was something that we both wanted. What are we going to do about that? I don't know. We forget it. I can't forget it. Sorry, Alex. Hey, Jane? There's one thing you overlooked. I entered that dream without any help or hookup. I did it all on my own. Paul. Tell me. You work miracles. Is there a possibility the President can be helped? A possibility. No guarantee. Why are you getting involved in this? Because we're the only ones who can help him now. The man is falling to pieces, Paul. He's just sitting there, in the Oval Office, making decisions based on his nightmares. He certainly wouldn't be the first world leader to take his dreams seriously. No, but he could be the first to destroy his country because of it. Isn't that overstating things a tiny bit? Do you realize what he plans to do? In Geneva? He's going to emasculate our nuclear deterrent and bring the whole damn country to its knees. Because of his dreams. Well, I'm not going to allow that to happen. Paul... You and I are going to bring the President here, and we're going to use everything that we have in our power to save him. What is the readout on Mrs. Matusik? Blood pressure 126 over 84... EKG normal. Hi. Hi. Still mad at me? No. But I've been thinking about... Doctor DeVries... I was under the impression were were conducting scientific research here. Excuse me. Pulse rate 95... 97... Her pulse is starting to rise... rising fast. Her EKG shows rapid contractions. Defib! She's fibrillating! Oh, my God, Paul, she's having a massive coronary. Impossible! Code Blue! Code Blue! Get a crash cart in here, right away! What the hell's going on? Get the Defib ready! 400 watt-seconds! - Do you want bi-carb? - Yes, and calcium chloride. I think we're losing her. - Straight line! - Clear! Stand clear! Once more. Stand clear! - Is there a pulse? - Nothing's happening. Let's try once more. Alex, would you mind? I really got to be alone. I'm still shook up about Mrs. Matusik. She must have had a bum ticker. Fucking shame. You may not know it to look at me, but I'm a pretty sensitive guy. It really affected me. It didn't affect your appetite. I eat to forget. Let go. Let go, or you're going to draw back a stump. A woman died, Tommy. Everybody dies. Over here. - Paul. - Yes? Could I have a word with you for a moment, please? Certainly. This isn't the way I wanted it at all. The President will be staying in the North Wing. But the North Wing is impractical. I've got everything I need right here. Well, you'll just have to make other arrangements. I'm sorry, but this is my area of expertise, not yours. I have considerations that you know nothing about, Paul. Just see that it's done. What considerations? Security, for one. Oh, come on, that's ridiculous. If you're concerned about security, then, this wing is clearly the easiest one to isolate. If you can't handle the move, my people will do it for you. What are you up to, Blair? Paul. I don't want to get into a debate over this. My sole concern is the well-being of the President. I don't know what you're concerned with anymore, Blair, but is it really the well-being of the President? How's my good right arm? Climbing the friggin' walls. This place is starting to close in on me. You haven't been taking anything? I don't touch drugs. Good. I'm messed up enough. At least, that's what people tell me. Well, they're wrong, Tommy. You lacked direction, that's all. Yeah. Took a guy like you to understand me, Bobby boy. All I did was channel your talents, son. When are you going to cut me loose from this dump? You promised you had big plans for me. I do. That's why I'm here. Charlie? Alex... Sorry about all this clandestine crap, but, uh, Blair likes to keep a close watch on things. Yeah, I noticed. I had to let you know you're in danger. What's going on here, Charlie? Last week I would have laughed at you, I'm not so sure about... What's going on? The stakes are a little higher than I imagined. Mister Blair is playing for keeps. That woman who linked with Tommy Ray didn't just die of a heart attack. What are you saying? I'm saying Blair's a ruthless killer. Officially, his organization doesn't even exist. I mean, these are the guys even the CIA are afraid of. What, you mean he's training me to be some kind of a spy? No, no, no, he wants more than spies, Alex. He wants assassins. Charlie. Come on. Hey! Hey! Hey! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! No! No! Charlie! Hello, Alex. You son of a bitch, you killed him. Prince was dangerous. He was an amateur. He would have blown the cover off the whole project. You murdered him. Yes. I did. You had Tommy Ray kill that woman in the dreamlink, didn't you? Yes. Why? I wanted to see if it could be done. You're a real humanitarian, Blair. I'm a realist. We live in a dangerous, hostile world. I will do whatever I have to, to keep this country safe. That's what scares me. You're a very intelligent young man, Alex. You've mastered an amazing technique. Surely, you can see the possibilities. During his dreamlink with Matusik, Tommy Ray stabbed her with a knife. A dream knife. The shock to Matusik's system caused a coronary, and she died. So, the old wives' tale comes true, after all. When you dream that you die, you die in life... the very same instant. Now we can go into an enemy's dream... kill him... make it look as if he died in his sleep. Do you realize what that means? It means no one's safe from you. The question is whether you're going to cooperate. I never had any doubts about Tommy Ray. Well, why should you? He killed his own father. He's a fucking psychopath. Alex... It's very simple. Either you work for me, or you die. Jump! - You okay? - Yeah. I'm okay. Good! Hey, my bike! That's my bike! We lost him. Yes. I'm afraid he has to be killed. He can only hurt us now. Welcome to Thornhill, Mr. President. Good to be here, Bob. Hello? - Jane! - Alex? Look, listen to me. Blair is out of control. I saw his people last night, they killed a man right in front of me. Blair's here now. He's brought the President with him. President? Of the United States? Yes. Paul could be right. About what? He thinks the President is in danger. No, you can't call the cops. Blair owns the cops... and the FBI. Alex? Jane, I'm coming back. We've got to stop Blair. Listen, there's security everywhere. I'll leave the door open at the loading dock. I think it's your best chance. You be careful. Don't worry about me. You just keep yourself alive. Count on it. Go, go! Cover the track! No! I owe you a beating, you son of a bitch! Let me talk to Snead. Come on! - Hey, Snead! - Snead! This better be good, because McClaren there, he'd just love to tear you a new asshole. Snead, I need your help. Now, why should I help you? Come on, Snead, do me a favor, I'll give you three winners. - Make it six. - Five. You're on. Look. There's going to be some people coming here in a couple of minutes. They're going to be in a hurry, and I want you to slow 'em down for me. No problem. Hey, Alex... you welch on us... you're a dead man. You're scaring the horses! Cover the main gate! Bring more cars around! Operator. Connect me with Fred Schoenstein's room, please. - Staff? - No, no, no. He's with the President's party. Schoenstein... Hello? Is there a problem, Paul? What are you doing? It does not concern you. Oh, I think it does. I'm afraid everything concerns me now. Will you excuse me? If something's deeply troubling you, let's sit down... talk about it. Should we, really? Should we talk about what you intend to do to the President? I thought that was clear. I intend to put an end to his nightmares. Of that I'm sure of. It's over now, Blair. I'll see to that. No one's going to believe you. By God, I'll make them believe me. I came to you with important research. Designed to illuminate. Not to destroy. Didn't I provide you with everything you needed? You took something that was vital, and very important, and you corrupted it. You let me. Yes. To my eternal shame. Dammit! Alex, thank God you're here. He's going to die in his sleep, Tommy. After all of the stress he's been undergoing lately, no one will suspect a thing. So, don't worry. Regular heroes, aren't we, Bob? Yeah. Sure, Tommy. Make sure that's under his head. The boxes will hide him nicely. I don't want that thing coming off. I'll take it from here. Fine. I'm going to stay with Blair. Make sure the car is clean when you're done. Right. Ah! I know what noises you're liable to make when you hear me. Don't be a fool. Why did Blair bring the President here? I don't know. Some tests! - Alex. - What? What is it? Come here. All right, out of the car. Come on. Oh, God. Oh. You bastard! I didn't do it! I didn't do it! What did he know, bitch? What did he know? Huh? Blair's planning on putting Tommy Ray in the President's dream, right? - Yes. - You tell me! Yes! How's he going to do it? The dream chamber? Alex, come on. Tell me, you son of a bitch, or I'm going to put your brains all over this car. He... The President's in the room next to Tommy Ray... When the President goes to sleep, - they're going to... - That's all I want to know. Let's go. I'm going into that dream, and I'm going to stop Tommy Ray. He's asleep. Won't be long before I can go in. Let's use my office. It's right beneath the President's room. I think you'll be close enough there to link. No lights. Lock the door. Take your time, Alex. Otherwise, you won't be able... Screw "otherwise"! It might be too late already. It's not working. Okay, okay. Now use your breathing. Mr. President. Listen to me. Your life is in danger. Bob Blair is trying to kill you. What the hell are you talking about? He sent somebody into this dream to assassinate you. Who are you? I'm here to help you. Look, all you got to do is wake up. - Wake up? - That's right. Wake up. Try, concentrate. Wake up! They gave me a sedative. A sedative? Well, we're just going to have to ride this out until it wears off. I did this. I caused it. That's not true. It's all a dream. None of it's real. Hello, Mr. President. Alex. What a surprise. I get to kill two for the price of one. Okay, what seems to be the trouble here? No trouble. No trouble at all. Then, move on, son. Abracadabra. Hm.. You sick bastard! Alex... have a heart. It's a dream, Alex! You can do anything you want in here! Haven't you figured that out yet? Help me. Help me. There he is... He's the one who pushed the button. He did this to you. He did this to you! He did this to you! Alex. You guys like Bruce Lee movies? I saw Enter the Dragon six times. You blew it, Alex. While you were fooling around with Novotny, I was learning how to take advantage in here. In this world, you're nothing, Alex. And me... I'm God. End of the line, boys! Aw! I know something you're really afraid of, Alex. Run! Run! Come on. Through here. It's a dead end. Nowhere to run. Maybe we don't run. Tommy. Tommy Ray. Why, Tommy? Why did you do it to me? Why, Tommy? Daddy? I loved you, Tommy Ray. Daddy, I'm sorry. He's dead. Dead? Alex. Are you all right? What happened? It's okay. I stopped the bastard. John. Is anything the matter? You all right? Bob. Stay away from me. Excuse us, gentlemen. No, no. Don't excuse us. Don't leave me for an instant. Let's go back to your room. I'm not going anywhere with you. You put that maniac in my dream to kill me. I wonder if you know just how crazy that sounds, Mr. President. You'll never get away with this. You can't touch me, John. And you know that. We're leaving. I think we should get as far away from here as possible. You're damn right. Hold it right there! It's okay. Thank you... I don't know how you did it. But thank you for my life. I'm just glad we got out of there in one piece, Mr. President. Sir? What about Bob Blair? Blair. He's a very powerful man. He's going to be coming after me. He can't afford to have me alive. I'll assign some men to you. I appreciate that, sir. But I think I should deal with this on my own. How did you get in here? It was easy. Bob. You're going to be late. Bob. Bob. Bob. Alex, what happened to you last night? You look like you didn't get any sleep. I didn't, but I had one hell of a dream. This is crazy. Crazy, Jane? This is fun. Where's your sense of adventure? Adventure? You call going to Louisville an adventure? What's wrong with Louisville? Churchill Downs is in Louisville. You don't happen to be planning on doing any gambling, do you? Jane, you know I never gamble. So, then, why are we going? Where we're going is not important. What's important is that it takes three days to get there. I haven't been on a train in years. Oh, that's not exactly true, Jane. Ooh, nice. Wait a minute. What if it's not as good as the dream? It will be. How do you know? Maybe I'm a little bit psychic. Yeah? Tickets? Tickets, please. Thank you. Have a good trip.
