I'm telling you. I am telling you. I hear lily's claiming she has a stomach tumor. [Laughter] Of course it isn't true. She and her brother have lived alone in that house for a long time. [Contrabass Music] [Phone rings] Hello? Hello? Lily... Calm down! Make her stop. Please! Make her stop! She won't listen to me. All right, Lilly. I'll try. Of course the doctor says it's a tumor. He's just trying to protect his patient. I'm trying. He won't listen! I'll rip her filthy tongue out of her throat. I can't bear this any longer. Please... I never lie. Tell anyone who asked that I said so. Lily Williams is carrying on her brother's child. Lilly! "THE KILL-OFF" Morning hon. What's the matter Luane? Here come on, sit up. The eggs are getting cold. - Are you upset about lily? - No. Come on sit up, your eggs are getting cod. I'm not hungry. Doctor's been saying terrible things about me. And why would he do that? Because of Lily. He said I was selfish ambitious. Oh, Lua... come on sit up. Is telling everyone I'm not really sick. He wouldn't say that. He did Ralph. I wish you weren't sick. - You're so sweet. - Yeah come on. Eat your breakfast. How dare he say a word about me. Hello son. Thanks for picking me up. The cold is terrible. Don't make a habit, OK?

Damn you Bobby, you're gonna get your ass shot off sneaking up on people. Well I hope if somebody tries to rob you don't resist them. Why not? You've got insurance. I risk your ass for someone insurance company. You know if you ever decide to uh... try to pull off such a robbery I'd be happy to help. [Laughs] I'll keep that in mind. Wouldn't you want such, ?don't you Pete? I used to have a hound dog around here. Fastest dog you ever saw. You know what happened to him? He ran himself over? Yeah, Bash his brains out with this butt. want a soda? No. Thinking on a beer. Hey Bobby! I hate him. Is so cold. And mean. Pete is solid, Myra. He's got guts. He's disgusting. I hate him. You just don't understand him. Sure I do. He's hard on you because he cares so much. Yeah... He cares a lot. You should been a doctor's kid, that guy fucks everything up. You know it's his fault that Luane is after me. I don't know how I'm gonna fix that bitch. I like your dad. Shut up about him. Sorry. Take your blouse off. Bobby... I want you take your blouse off. ?No! Hey! Do it! Don't yell at me. Just... do it. Okay. [Piano Music] Okay. That's enough. Why don't you leave that for Myra? Okay nowhere I can lay my hands on a fast 10 grand. That's pretty bad Pete. I'd burn the place down if I thought I could collect. It's a thought. Remember when this place was hot? Sure. What happened? Who knows. What brings people in? - I forgot. - They too. Cheap drinks. Yeah. - Good music! - Not around here. Girls! [TV background] For the future... ?Ralph! Cut it off, Ralph! Ralph... honey is that you? Bow! You scared the shit out of me! [laughs] Don't ever do that again! It was a joke! I mean it! Okay. It could have scared me to death. Okay! Promise me! Okay... I promise a little drinky poor aware? Come keep me company. I'm lonely. I know honey... don't do that! Don't make fun of your old sick wife. Oh, Luane...! I already had my fun tonight. Well, go on. Tell me about it. Her name was Elizabeth. What did she look like? Nothing special... but young, about 17 or 18. Go on. I met her at the Arcade. Two drinks she was all over me. You're still a beautiful man Ralph. We did it in her car. Are you going to see her again? I don't think so... she lives too far away. Thanks for telling me honey. Sure. What's on TV? I don't know, check the guide. [Accordion Music] Turn around. Oh you want to check out the merchandise. Hey! Can you dance? What is this? Did you have dancing lessons when you were a little girl? Fuck off! Would you like to earn some money? Inside, standing up? I don't like your attitude. [Telephone rings] Ain't ready. I'll get it. Hello? Oh I'll call you later. Bye. Sorry honey. It's okay. Hum... hummm... Ah! What? [Laughing] - Ralph! - What? Stop! I'm not doing anything! I will not help you humiliate me or yourself. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. Make the call. Why are you doing this Bobby? You should be glad I want a job. ?No! I'm sick of talking to you! Now make the call! Mr. Brockton? This is Dr. Ashton This... uh... you know, my son Bobby's interested in some off-season work. [Laughs] All right all right all right... You're all set. - Ralph... - What? You... You don't regret anything do you? Like what? Do you ever wish things were different? What do you mean? Never mind. Hey Bobby what you doing? I'm working. I don't need any help. You've been replaced. That's my job! Go talk to Mr. Brockton. [Accordion Music] Why'd you do it Bobby? I needed a job. It's been my job for 10 years! It's too bad. You're taking the bread out of people's mouths! So what? I guess you heard about Bobby stealing my other job. Yeah I heard something. You wonder why. Doctor's a pretty influential man. Luane's been saying things about Bobby, Ralph. I haven't heard anything. You got a spiteful wife Ralph. She'll go after anybody with a little dirt under their fingernails. That was a raw deal Luane's father gave you before he died... but she had nothing to do with it. Of course she did Ralph. Her father ripped me off for 10.000 dollars... and then died before he had time to spend it. Now what do you think happened to the money? I don't know Pete, but Luane doesn't have it. What are you gonna do Ralph? About what? Well you gotta earn a living. I don't know. Well I got a friend I could call. He has a factory in the city. I once went all the way to the city for two days. I couldn't think, I kept getting lost. It took me a week to get over it. I can't go far from home. Take Luane with you. Mean move? Well you gotta earn a living. Talk to her... let's see what she says. Okay. You know what a broom looks like? Sure. [Saxo & Trumpet Music] How did that look? Up to the stumble I mean. Okay I guess. Oh you're a big help. Okay start the music. [Saxo & trumpet music] That was great miss! Who is that? The janitor. My name's Ralph. Look I told you I don't want anybody watching me yet. You'll be fine! Ralph... Sorry. Would you clean up the back room in the basement for Danny? Sure. Start the music. [Music Saxo & Trumpet] Hey Pete! You've been selling drugs out of my place! What are you talking about Pete? Don't lie to me Bobby! You listen to that bitch, Pete? You know I don't talk to her! But word gets around, pal. We're trying to help your business Pete. I don't like that kind of business! I don't like you Bobby... I never have. As long as I can remember I've had no use for you at all stay out of my place. Stay away from Myra. Hello? Ah... poor Myra. ...I'm tempted not to let Pete know. Of course not. I never call Pete directly. Ralph's at home? I'll call you later. Bye. What are you doing home so early? Bobby stole my job at the Arcade. What are you talking about? Stole my job Lu! The doctor asked Mr. Brockton to hire Bobby. That little son of a bitch! That's a hundred dollars a week gone. That's fifty two hundred dollars a year. Everybody must have been afraid to tell me. All that's left is the pavilion. That's not enough for us to live on. How dare he cross me like that! Luane... What? Pete offered me a job at a factory in the city. No! I couldn't go alone, but if we both went. Pete's just making trouble! I could do it if you went with me! You always know how to get around. You always tell me the right thing... I'm not leaving here Ralph! Never! Any place we go will be the same so it was here. People laugh and make fun of us... make jokes about me being old enough to be your mother. But we need money Luane. You don't understand... you just don't understand! We have to live! I have money. You do? I thought we used up all your money a long time ago. I have some tucked away. What do you mean? It's enough to last us a while. For how long? Until Bobby gets bored with his little games. You think he will? Don't worry hon. Luane will take care of you. That's why your daddy wanted you to marry me. He knew I'd always look after you... didn't he? Sure he did. [Piano and Violin Music] Danny! Danny Lee... what? What's your real name? Agnes Tuttle. Sure. Charlotte Montclair. Dolores Dubois. What are you doing on the streets? I'm really a nice girl, I'm just doing that temporarily. Of course. Mother's been awful sick. A sick mother no less. And I have a couple of younger brothers to support... because daddy died. And the crops have been awful bad on the farm this year. Shall I spare you the final southern family routine? If you don't mind. Wait baby. I'm gonna start the bar. Go ahead. You really think anybody in town is going to give you a job... without checking with me? [Laughs] Besides... you already have a job... don't you? [Contrabass & Trumpet Music] Stay away from Bobby from now on. - Why? - Because I said so. I thought you liked Bobby. Did you hear me? Okay. Has he done it to you yet? - What? - Has he? Done what? Has he fucked you yet? No. You sure? You really... he hasn't. You don't want me to find out otherwise Myra... He can't. Which one you think Luane? The one with the blue. Okay. Too bad there won't be any more hand-me-downs from Mr. Brockton. You're looking especially handsome this evening. What's the occasion? That new stripper's opening at the pavilion. Oh that should bring him some business. I hope so... for Pete's sake. I'll try and wait up for you. Oh don't tie yourself out hon. I won't. [Country Music] Something's gotta give... How's Danny doing? Is she nervous? Oh shit... Oh [country music] Hello. Shouldn't be calling here. Hang on. Myra... Make it quick. Hello. What do you want? And what if I get caught? [Music] Thanks Myra. Hello, Ralph. Quite it crowded, Pete! We ought to start. Luane went crazy at the mention of movement. Now... I understand but you folks got to live. She says we can manage a while. On what? She had some savings I didn't know about it. Well lucky you. Yeah. Lucky lucky you. The way it always thinks ahead. That's the truth. Well how about lending me something? You having money troubles too, Pete? Well... No, nothing serious. My business is slow. Sure? If it's up to me Pete... you have to ask Luane... Well but you do all the earning. You don't have your own account? Nope. I always turn it right over to Luane. I'm a good earner but she's a good manager. She's sure. Sorry I can't help you out Pete. Enjoy the show Ralph. [Contrabass Music] Hi! Hi! - Is everything okay? - I'm a nervous wreck. I have to get something out of the basement. Aren't you gonna wish me good luck? Good luck. [Country Music] Ey put the music! [Trumpet Music] He will kill me if he catches us! He won't catch us. - No, you don't know him! - Yes I do. - Bobby, you... - Shut up! You meet me in the alley and I'll pick you up. I have a little surprise for us tonight. - What? - You'll see. I gotta go. [Trumpet & Saxo Music] [Phone rings] Hello? Hello, Luane. Hello Pete... [Trumpet & Saxo Music] Good night. Good night Raggs. Watch your ass, Myra. Sure. You cold? A little. This will warm you. Oh thanks. [Trumpet solo Music] Hello Luane. Hello Pete. Been a long time. 15 years. You got old. We are old. You mind if I smoke? Yes. I want my money Luane. What money? The money your father stole from me. My father never stole from anyone. Bullshit. I loaned your father ten thousand dollars to save his ass... when the Carlton deal went sour that was between you and my father. But he died before he had a chance to spend it. So? So I know you got it. I heard you hired a stripper to bring in some business. Yeah. She's out right now with your boy. You can't hurt me like that. Don't you love Ralph? Let's just say Ralph keeps me informed. Luane you owe me that money. I paid you back. What are you talking about? I kept my mouth shut all these years... about what you did to Myra. Don't worry. I'll keep quiet. Where you get a gun? What gun? How come you decided to let me try it? What the fuck? Hold on. [Piano Music] I think you should know the truth about me. What's that gorgeous? I'm not really a stripper. You're not? I'm serious. Pete found me on the street. I was turning tricks. You do a trick for me? [Piano Music] Morning hon! You got home late last night. I guess so. How was it? What? The pavilion. It was a pretty good crowded. How was the stripper? Okay I guess Ralph you're no help. Sorry hon. What's her name? Danny Lee. Cute. What's she like? I don't think she's done much stripping. But who is she? Honey I haven't a clue. Where did you go after the show? I went to a nightclub. Who did you go with? No one! Guess with some of the girls I met there. Take it easy. - Take it easy hon! - Leave me alone. - What's wrong. - I don't feel well. Ugh! Something I can do...? Leave me alone! Uh. [Shout] [Dishes noises] [Piano & Accordion Music] Hello? Is Ralph there? No Luane. Where is he Raggs? I don't know. Is he with that trap? I don't keep track of people, Luane. Why not Raggs? Keep an eye on Ralph for me will you? I'll pay you. Pete pays me okay. We both know the pavilion's in trouble. Hey, why don't you leave Ralph alone? I give Ralph everything he needs. You've never given him anything. I know where you live before you came here Raggs. You had a family didn't you? Stop gasping about people, Luane. You had a wife named Jane and two sons... but they died. How did they die Raggs? Before someone stops you permanently. How come you weren't hurt in the accident? You don't remember? You killed your own children... and you were too drunk to remember it! What was that all about? - Hi! - Good morning. Hi! Hi! Okay if I mop in here Pete? Yeah. Hey Ralph... how come Luane never tells any dirty stories about me? Maybe there's nothing to tell you saying me and my daughter ain't interesting? What do you mean Pete? Nothing... no. Payday Ralph. [Trumpet Music] We get some rough customers. Sure. Here. Thanks Pete. Pardon me for saying so, Ralph... but you look good with a young girl like Danny. Looks right. Ralph! What are you doing? Hello Luane. Bobby? Just thought I'd stop by to say hi. I have to tell Ralph to lock the door from now on. So this is where you keep yourself? Everything at your fingertips. It's very convenient. Isn't it though? You know... my father says there's really nothing wrong with you at all. So I heard. What a handsome young man you turned into. I remember when you were a little baby. I remember when your mother died. I think it was too much for your father raising you all by himself. You turned out wild. Very wild. Then you should congratulate me on becoming an honest citizen. You've never done an honest day's work in your life. [Laughs] It's a shame about Ralph losing his job. You'll soon get bored with work Bobby. It just doesn't suit you. I don't think so. No, I certainly like the life of a working man. You'd better go Bobby. Ralph will be home soon. I don't think so, Luane. He's been keeping himself pretty busy down the pavilion... since that stripper started. Get out Bobby! There's quite a look of that gal. Does Pete know you were out with Myra last night? No. Gotta go. Bye bye. [Telephone rings] Yeah? [Trumpet & Saxo Music] [Applauses] I guess we're running low on pepper. What? You should pick some up when you go to the store. What makes you think we're running low on pepper? I just figured we were. We're not? There's still some left in the kitchen shaker? - What are you talking about? - I just wondered. I noticed you only peppered one of my eggs. Luane, is pepper in the shaker right there in the tray. And why didn't you pepper my eggs? You always pepper my eggs exactly the same I've cooked your eggs the same way for 15 years... and you never complained. Then why didn't you pepper them right today? [Phone rings] Hello? I told you I won't treat you anymore. What do you want with Bobby? No Luane! Hello? What do you want Luane? Get your feet off my bed. I want you to do something about Danny lee. I'm sure you do. I've had a lot of girls but I've never seen him like this. I'll pay you generously... but you have to give up Ralph's job. Say please. Well if you really want to keep the job, Bobby. Not really. I didn't think so. Oh you're the cutest thing I ever saw. Maybe I should be in movies. Oh you could be. Will she divorce you? If I mention that she'd throw me right out the house. She really such a nasty old bitch. Mostly she's just getting back at the people who hurt her. You're like who? Most people around here. She was 35 when we got married I was 18. You should have heard the dirty things people said. Just because she wanted someone to love... before she got too old. Didn't bother me. Almost killed her. Sounds like you love her. She always treated me good. Do you want a divorce Ralph? I guess so. You don't want me walking the streets again, do you? I have no money Danny. Well we could go someplace else. No! I can't. Why not? I get all confused when I leave here. Well where does that leave me? Luane says Bobby will be tired of being a handyman soon. Then I'll have work again. That could be weeks... years. I love you Ralph. I love you too Danny. [Trumpet solo Music] There is another way. I know. You thought of it too? Sure. The first time I saw you. Really? I guess I even thought of how. [Trumpet solo Music] Where's my stuff? No more. Why? No more stuff Myra. You can't do this to me! Come here. My mother used to hold me. I want my stuff! Fucking bitch! You were out late hon. What did you do? Pete needed some help after closing. You're working so late he should be paying you more. Pete pays me OK. Luane... ?how come you never told me about that money you had saved? I never thought about it. Where did it come from? My father. What are you worrying about money for Ralph? I should know about it. I mean suppose something happened to you. What's gonna happen to me Ralph? Nothing! I mean suppose you got really sick. Well I'm not gonna get that sick... and if I do I'll tell you what to do. What do you mean to to tell me what to do? You think you're smart enough to run your own life? Ralph! Come back! Ralph! [Accordion & Piano Music] [Phone rings] Hello? Help... help me Raggs. I need help. What do you want Luane? Ralph's going to kill me. Don't blame him. I mean it, he is! Hey look, tell him if he needs any help. You don't believe me? Why don't you call Bobby? I'm sure he'd be happy to help. I did... and he let me down. You tell him, I know. What are you talking about? Just tell Bobby: wait till Pete finds out what he did to Myra. What did he do to Myra? Just tell Bobby, I know. - What's going on Myra? - What do you mean? Luane just called. She said Bobby let her down. She also said she's gonna make sure... Pete finds out what Bobby's done to you. Are you okay? You sure. I'm fine. Now if you're in trouble or anything... and what could you do for me Raggs? You can't even stand up! What's wrong? Luane called to talk to Raggs. Oh, shit! I think she knows about this stuff. You know, about me. Bitch! You killed me! He'll kill both of us! He won't find out. He screwed me one last time. What are you gonna do? Just wait for me in the alley. I'll be late. [Trumpet & Saxo Music] How you doing hon? I'm tired. Let's go downstairs. No Ralph. Okay Danny... I'll do it. Do you want me to come with you? No. I'll do it. You sure? Sure. She's a sick old lady anyway. Okay I'll see you in a little while then. Yeah. [Accordion Music] [sound] Ralph? Thank god you're home I was so worried. Ralph? I'm talking to you. [Contrabass & Accordion Music] Ralph? What do you want? I want my ten grand. That's my money. It's all I have left. Bullshit, Luane. You think I'm lying? Yeah! It's the truth! Tell you what. You give me my ten grand... I'll let you keep the interest. Why should I? Because you screwed everything up? Your business... your family! Huh! That's all the money Ralph and I have! We have no other income! Remember? Whose fault is that? My own of course... for putting a drug dealer out of business. And it's my fault your daughter is a drug addict. What did you say? Bobby's been giving her drugs ever since you beat him up. You're a liar! You know I never lie. That mouth of yours is poison. I think it's time I told everyone around here about you and Myra. Shut up! Told everyone... you raped your own daughter when she was 12 years old. I was drunk, shut up! You still want her, don't you? Shut up... shut up... shut up! [Gun shot sound] [Phone rings] Ralph come on in and seat down. Have a seat, Ralph. Poor sweetie. Maybe he did it. Would you stick with Ralph if he didn't have any money? I love Ralph. I think he killed Luane. Ralph? Hey... sweetie! Spares the innocent dumb Ralph shit. I was with Ralph all last night. Oh really? Raggs can I have a soda? Get it yourself. I'll get it down. [Juke Box music] Who do you think killed Luane? I think you did. We both agree that Ralph's not up to it. But I think you did it. Me? Why would I kill Luane? You're the only one who's got the balls... except for me. Get out of my face Bobby. Bobby you're next. Hey Ralph... what about that loan you promised me? What loan? You remember... you offered to loan me some money if Luane was out of the way. I don't remember. You're not trying to welch on a promise, are you Ralph? No, Pete...! Ralph! Hon... I want to go home. Can we? I don't think so. Myra! - What? - Bring me a soda. [Contrabass Music] You're next. Bang! Said you two can go. - Really? - Yeah. Let's get out of here. Jack, come on, sit down. See you. Bye! Come here. They think I did it. They didn't say so but I could tell. Did you? No. What are you gonna do? Split. You want to come? I guess so. Does Pete have any cash around? Sometimes in the safe. Well I have to get it. I'll do it. You? Yeah I know the combination. He always goes some dinner on five. Pick me up. Okay... I'll pick you up. [Contrabass Music] Hey Raggs! Bring me a bottle. Are you sure? Bring two glasses. I think they suspect young Bobby. I'm not surprised. Cha cha cha! Oh poor sweetie... you feel sad, don't you? I guess so. Well... the sooner you clean out all this junk the better. Maybe you're right. Of course I'm right. Hey I'm hungry. Let's go out. No! I don't like to eat out. - Why not? - It's too expensive. Ralph we can afford it. No! We got eggs. Okay. Dad? Dad? Daddy? [Contrabass Music] I told you to stay away from Bobby. Stay away from me! [Contrabass Music] He was there and I need the money. Shit! I knew you polk! Dont touch me! - Where you going? - Get the money! He's drunk! Take it easy Pete. I told you to stay away from my daughter, Bobby. Is that the gun used to kill Luane? Yeah. Now we just need a little money so we can get out of here. I know what you did to her. You don't give a shit about her! [Piano Music]
