I don't know. - Eine happy family! - Just keep smiling. - Smile. - You just pulled off my ski! Honey, don't put your thing on his ski. You're gonna get... - You're stepping on my ski! - The underside? - Like that? - Closer together? - I don't know. - Guys, smile. Put your arms up. Like this. Like that? Hey! Oh, my God! Finn! - You're on my ski, okay? Stop! - Guys. Guys. Just separate the boys. And then I should... Guys, you're separated. Stop! Can you say that again? He wants me to get on the underside. Are you serious? No, no, no. Pete, stay where you are. Don't shoot this part. Wait till we're ready. Please stand up straight. - Please look into the camera. - I'm trying. Please just smile. Come on, guys, say "Austria!" Austria! He wants poles up again. He wants us to keep doing poles up. I don't know. A little crowded, huh? Yeah, it's lively. Yeah, I think it's just that time of day. I think so, too. Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Honey, have you noticed there are no kids around here? I mean, it seems kinda weird, don't you think? Maybe it's just different school schedules. Yeah, maybe. This way, this way. Hey, guys, stay where I can see you, please. Hi. Thank you. It's Stanton. Who are you texting? Uh, Zach. Zach-from-work Zach? Yeah. Oh. Why is he texting you? Are you friends now? No. I just told him about our trip, and it turns out that he and his girlfriend, Rosie, they're traveling through Europe as well. Oh, no kidding? Amsterdam, it seems, at the moment. "Hashtag no agenda." Oh, come on. "Hashtag live your best life." Hashtag get better hashtags. Yeah. Right, yeah, no, I know. - Hashtag don't do hashtags. - Right. Hashtag stop wasting your time. Right? With hashtags. Honey, can you get off your phone now? - I'm all done. I'm all done. - Good. - Okay. - Let's just be here, okay? I see. Hello? Hello? Hello, I'm Charlotte. So, your flight was okay? Yeah, it was good. - At what time did you get in? - Oh... Um, I think about midday, I would... Yeah, I wanted to get out on the mountain, ski before we checked in. Well, I'm sorry I was not there to meet you. Now, what have I got for you? You are... - The Stantons. - Stanton. Yeah, I know. - Resort map. - Oh, thank you. - Key cards. - Great. Oh, actually, I'm curious. Are there other kids around here? No, not here. The town of Fiss, maybe minutes of 20 from here. There is all families. But here is better. It's lively. The Ibiza of the Alps. And you will want to party all night. Now, in Europe, we think it is unhygienic to sauna in the swimsuit, so everyone naked. Here the body is not to be ashamed of. Well, speak for yourself. No, your body is good. Celebrate it. Okay. Yes. - I will for sure do that. - Both. Yeah. No, no. No question. - Good. - We'll celebrate it. So I am here as friend, ja? Do you want to be my friend? - Oh. Oh, sure. - Um... Then we are friends. - Oh. Great. Wonderful. - Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hey, guys, hang up your ski stuff to dry, please. Boys, cool it. Put all that stuff in drawers, okay? It hurts! Tell you something. Them sharing a queen is gonna be a disaster. Honey. No. Now I'm done. Zach kept texting. Asking about Ischgl and where we're staying, so... All right, but we're not looking for them to no-agenda their way here, are we, Pete? No. No, no, no. That's why I wanted to finish that conversation. Yeah. Good. Look. I found my dad's old hat. I thought I'd bring it and wear it on the slopes. No way. Have him here with us. That's so sweet. I love that. Yeah. Sorry if I've been, you know... Oh. That's why we're here. Right? Yeah. It's good for all of us. Okay. - We should stop, right? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Done. Okay. Okay. Seriously. 'Cause we're gonna want a big breakfast in the morning. Yes. - Yeah. - Okay. I'm gonna grab a shower. All right. Okay. Knock, knock. What? What? What do you mean, what? What? Taking my clothes off. She said we're supposed to celebrate our bodies. I knew you were gonna pick up on that. Yeah. So we don't lose each other. Good thinking, right? There wasn't much left in the arts and crafts stuff except for these back-to-school stickers, which the boys are not gonna be too excited about. No. Yeah. They won't be too psyched. Honey, you're gonna wear that under a helmet, right? Yes. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. - For under. Mmm-hmm. Hey, boys, we're leaving in five. Get your stuff together. Okay. Slow up, Finn! Hey, hey, hey! Stop! Whoa. You gotta wait up for the rest of the group, okay, bud? Okay. Oh, God. He's just playing it up. Honey, honestly, it's just a phase. You've gotta let it go. No, I know. 'Cause, I mean, the more you make of it... The more we give attention to it... Right. It's gonna become more of a thing. It becomes a thing and, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, got it. - Exactly. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Way to go, Em. You're like a rocket. All right, lookit, guys, this is what I'm thinking. I'm thinking we should just have some soup right now and then we can have some of those yummy pastries at 4:00. And then we'll still be hungry for dinner. Doesn't that sound like a good plan, you guys? Maybe we ski the Beast after lunch. - I'll do that, Dad. - Yeah. Oh. Um... I don't think it'll be that challenging. It looks black but it skis red. Really? American blue. Yeah. Several of the black runs are American blue. European red. They just call 'em black for the prestige. Where did you hear that? I just know it. Yeah. It'll be fine. You can handle it. How about this? Why don't we go and we find some good powder? And then we can get in some practice runs, you know, for the, uh... Rodeo? No, Pete. For the... Wow. It's a controlled avalanche. Yeah. Is that okay, Pete? Yeah. It's fine. Mom? Mom! Pete? You good? You okay? Wow, huh? That was... I mean, right? Nuts. Yeah. Those people are laughing. Everyone okay? Oh, hey. - Here we go. Uh... - We'll clean all this off. What can I get for you? I'm gonna go with soup. Yeah. - Get the pastries later? - Uh... Sure. But soup. Soup for now. Yeah. - Thank you. - Phew. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Please. Watch what you're doing. It's cool, yeah? No, it's not cool. You could've crushed my son. You all right? Yeah. - Please. - What is going on here? They stop not hard. What happened here? Let's just walk away from this. Let's just walk away. Everything cool. You want help with your shoes? No. What was all of that? I don't get it. No, he wasn't looking and he slid the thing back on him. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm good. He's fine. It just startled me. You look pretty. Thank you. Um... You think you could... I'm just... - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - Oh, it's crowded. - Wow. So are you gonna say something about... - Yay! - Oh! My good friends! Oh, I think she wants us to, uh... No, no, no. She's just waving. Hi. No, now she's kinda beckoning. - Okay. - In a way. We'll make an excuse. There's no reason I take. Okay. Yeah. I think it'd be rude now. - We're with her. - Oh. Okay. - The woman in the white. - No, we're not. Ah. Yes. Your white wine and scotch. - Thank you very much. - Perfect. And bring another round for me and my friends, yes. Oh, no, I'm good for now. Yeah. Oh, no. I think one is fine. - Thank you. - No. It's smart to get now. The bar gets crazy. The Ibiza of the Alps, yes? Oh, right. - I drink if you not. - Okay. Going to clubs. Ah, ah, ah. Nice. So a night off, huh? So you find you get enough time off. Oh, sure. Enough to catch a dick whenever I like. That's great. Time is nice to have. Oh. We have guests. - Charlie. - Hello. Hi. - Hello. Hi. - Hello. - These are my friends, Billie. - I'm Billie, yes. - My wife, Billie. Hi. - And Pete. I was just talking about you. All good, I hope. - Sure. - Yeah. Well, what has she been saying? It was pretty brief. I mean... Yeah, she's a fan of yours. Yeah, positive. - Positive stuff. - Yeah. I said I can catch a dick whenever I like. Is that... That's right. That is what she said. Yeah. Right. Uh... Okay, no, I just thought, you know... I thought... I was kidding. Why? You think we're getting married? No! God, no! Okay. I didn't think we're getting married. I just thought, we had a really nice day today... I wanna go. I just, you know... Uh-huh. So you two know each other from...? Oh, well, I'm... Well, here. Yeah. Yeah, I came in on Sunday and she showed me around. Yeah, but you are a quick learner. Quick. And you have a good day on the mountain? Ugh. We had a great day. Great conditions. Just a real alpine experience. - Yeah. - Well, we almost all died in an avalanche. What? - But, yeah, it was great. - Billie. It was fantastic. Billie, hold on. I mean, there was a moment. It was an avalanche. - Good lord. - Good fuck! - No, I mean, there was... - Yeah. For a moment, it could've felt dicey. Hang on a second. For quite a moment, it felt incredibly dicey. - Seriously. - Okay. And then it was over, and it was fine. We were all fine. The kids were really scared. Of course. No question. I mean, Pete, what they saw was... Scary for them. Absolutely. Yes. But we're here and they're upstairs watching a movie. Just hanging out. And I guess, emotionally, we've just been through a lot lately. My dad passed away eight months ago. Yeah. - It happens. - That's a shame. It's been a lot. So, uh, we came here. And that's why we're here. So let's just be here. - Okay. - Here's to here. - Here's to here. - Here's to here. My father was a travel agent for 30 years. He never really went anywhere. His knowledge of the world was based solely on research. When he retired, alongside a good buddy of his, they received this exquisite set of cut glassware. He had a special shelf for them and he put them up there, and even when we came to visit, he wouldn't bring them down. I don't know what he was saving them for. Maybe nothing. But, went back home for the funeral, I met with Hughie. That's the friend of his dad's. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. So we had a toast to Dad with the same set of glasses, you know, over at Hughie's. And after, he just threw them right into the dishwasher. And I asked him, "Do you use those for every day?" And do you know what he said to me? "Every day is all we have." Yep. Powerful. Powerful stuff. So, I mean, to me, you know, today was today. Here's to today. Today! Yeah. Yeah. Even so, I think that you should report to resort safety. Oh. Yes. If only to give you ease. That's an excellent idea. Yes, that's what I wanna do. - Yeah. - Right? - Great. Great idea. - Yeah. Ja? - Yeah. - Yeah. Guys. So we wish to make a complaint. Yes? Uh, that there was an avalanche that we, um... That caused alarm yesterday. The controlled avalanche from Zwolferkopf, yes. Well, you say it was controlled, but I think you need to know that people really freaked out. But everyone was safe, yeah? Well, we don't know that, in fact. I can tell you. Everyone was safe. Oh. Well, that's great. That is such good news. 'Cause that helps. That helps to hear that. Yeah, I gotta say just... I don't understand why there weren't any warnings posted anywhere. - There was a warning. - What? Where? Posted at lifts, gondolas, hotel receptions, restaurants, shops, bars, soda machines, toilets. Well, I don't know what to tell you. We didn't see any of that. Well... - Um... - Is that not correct? Maybe... Gosh. I might have seen something that mentioned snow conditions. Yes. They were everywhere. So you saw it? There were a lot of... I saw one sign. There was... Hold on. No, the point I'm trying to make... - What is your point? - Here's the point. What's your point? Warning or no warning, mmm-hmm, seen it or not, we would just like some acknowledgment that it was handled poorly. It was handled perfectly. No, it was not. - Yes. - No! You cannot tell me that that was the way it was supposed to go. - Yes, exactly like that. - No! Snow went all over the plates. Snow went all over the plates. Here's what I think you're not picking up on. This was a huge event for our family, okay? And, sir, I don't wanna make this a legal matter between us. - I don't. - Mmm. Billie. - No, I don't wanna... - I know, but... What I'm saying is what I don't want. We're not in America where you sue because your coffee is hot, madam. Screw you. I'm an attorney. Okay. You've heard our complaint. Yeah, well, someone needs to hear it. Thank you for your time. And "no thank you for your time" from me. That is for certain. - I've got it, okay? - Okay. What a jackass, huh? Yeah. Who's a jackass? Oh, the man who's supposedly in charge. That's who. Yeah, big jackass. Uh... Do you, um, have... Yeah. - Like that? - You want to get it like that. There you go. How much do you love traveling with me? This much. Mom. Mom. What? Oh, my God. - Pete? - Mmm. What? Oh, okay. - Oh, my God. - Should I wake up Em? Yes. Yes. And let's not watch people sleep. I don't like that. We gotta go. Where are we going? Are we going to a different mountain? No, better. It's gonna be great. Yeah, it's a Daddy surprise. Um, I think I should go in and get something from the buffet. We are late though. I'm starving. No, I'm gonna get a little fruit, okay? No, you know, we'll be fine. Dad! Dad! Car! Car! Car! Can you pop the trunk, please? We're here. Sorry. The Stantons? - Yep. That's us. - Hi. They were just about to go. Oh, I'm so sorry. We overslept. Come on, guys. Let's go. Let's go. Hey, we're heli-skiing, guys. How cool is that, huh? Awesome! Yeah. A little Daddy treat. Daddy thought of it. I'm so hungry. Once we get up on the powder, bud, you'll forget all about that. Yeah, maybe they have a protein bar or something. Do you have a bar? Ah, yes. Yes, there is a seat belt. What? We really should climb on now. Please. Oh, is there gonna be a briefing? Yes, yes! We can do that on the way! Please, come! Where's my glove? You mean we're just gonna go? Isn't there any more information that we need to have? As in? We'll get all that when we get on board! - Mom! - What? I can't find my glove! Why are you so stupid? Hey! Hey! No. Come here a second. Come here. Guys, what don't we do? Call people names. And so what do you say now, Finn? I'm sorry. Good job, Finn. Hang on, Pete. No, not good job. Look him in the eye right now and say it loud and clear, so he can hear you and understand you. I'm sorry! - We should go! - There we go! Please! Please! We really should depart! The weather may change! Okay. It's just that he's missing a glove. Wait a minute. What? Change to what? Let's go! Every day is all we have! I understand that, Pete, but he doesn't have a glove. We're missing a glove here, and she just said something about the weather changing. They're gonna have a spare glove! Yeah! You have a spare? I don't know! Come! Please! They've gotta have spare gloves! She just said she doesn't know! Well, he can borrow yours! What? Then I'll get cold, Peter! Okay, okay! He can borrow mine! It'll fly off! It doesn't fit him! Do you have spare gloves? Do you have spare gloves? Protein bars? Billie, I spent two grand on this, okay? - I'm well aware of that, Pete! - Okay, let's go! Let's have a great time, okay? Come on! What? No! Pete, stop! Don't walk away from us! We are missing gloves! The children are starving! And there's something about the weather changing! Get in the car! Do you want help, Mom? No, thank you! Are you sure? It's fine! Get in the car! In the car! Here's your glove, sweetie. Okay. All right. Well, we still have the rest of the afternoon. What's everyone up for? Beach? If we gobble all this up, we'll still have an hour, hour and a half up on the mountain. I think we're gonna cut our losses for today. Just hunker down this afternoon. We could sit around the fire and make popcorn. And then maybe later, you boys can watch a movie, and you and I can have some time. I love that idea. Me too. - Yeah. I think that's smart. - Yeah. Fruit. Guys, put fruit in yourselves, please. I could do something but I feel really bad for Mom. All right, I'm sorry. Oh, don't you love me? You're telling me that they just showed up? No. They were nearby and actually called. They just happened to call? Billie, yes, they called. When? When did they call actually? - When? - Yeah. When? When I was in the bathroom. You know Zach. No. No. Actually I don't. I don't know Zach, Pete. Not well. Not like the way you know your work buddy. Right? And I certainly don't know the woman. I'm sorry, okay? I didn't know how to play the phone call. Shh! - Can we help? - Hey. - Oh, no. Stay seated. - No. We're good. Yeah, you guys just relax. I hope they like carrot sticks and Goldfish. I'm sorry, I should've... Yeah, well, but now you can't. - Oh. Okay. Hey. - Hey. Ugh, that looks so good. It does? All right. So, you guys, let's hear about this trip. Well, I mean, from what we remember, it's been epic. From what I've seen, yeah. It's been intense. We've hit, what, like, three countries in four days. Just Tuesday, we were having morning strudel in Dusseldorf and by that afternoon, we were hiking along the Rhine River in France. Oh, my gosh. Wow. And, um, there might have been some shrooms on one or all of those days. Does that sound weird when I say it? No. I loved the way you said it. "Shrooms"? Do I sound like a narc? - Shroomies. - Shrooms. - Shrooms. Just shrooms. - Shrooms. We did shrooms. So you did shrooms? - Yes. We did shrooms. - Yeah, we did. Okay, got it. I don't know, I think the whole point of this trip was me just stepping out of my comfort zone and following Rosie's lead, and so that's what I've been doing, and I've just been relinquishing all of this... Not relinquishing. Expanding. Expanding. - Yeah. - Yeah, sorry. Um, I've been expanding. His world. It's a positive thing. - Okay. - Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know how blind people, all their other senses get more intense? - Right. - Yeah. Being with Rosie is like that. But I didn't even have to go blind. Babe. - Seriously. - Oh. I call her Rosie the Riveting. He does. And it's so good for me, 'cause you know me, Pete. Yeah, I do. I mean, normally I'm all about hotels and... - Right? - Yeah. Room service, crisp sheets. Right, right, right. You know, at breakfast I'm thinking, "Okay, well, where are we gonna have dinner?" And then, before I go to bed, I'm thinking, "Well, tomorrow we should get breakfast at that same place "because they have that one thing that I like." We're experimenting with new. Thank you. It's a really good place for him to live. You have to live there. Hey, I know I'm not leaving. Yeah, we just found in each other this desire to share our lives in a certain way. So it's about travel, adventure. We don't see ourselves having kids, so it's about us living for us. Hashtag no agenda. - I mean, we love that. - Aw. That's all Rosie. She nails the hashtags. - Thanks. - Oh, you're the one. - Yeah. - Yeah. And, I mean, no agenda's what got us here tonight, right? I mean, we didn't know what tonight was gonna be, and then you texted and here we are. Yeah, we don't even have return tickets. Like, who knows what's next? Well, you kinda know what's next, don't you? 'Cause you have work on Monday. Correct? Oh. Yeah, no, I mean, for sure. Oh, no, yeah. We'll get tickets home. I have to show a commercial space - in Cambridge at 8:30, so... - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. So what about you guys? You guys getting in good ski days? Yeah. Yeah, good. Yeah. Cool. Um, I mean, we did have a moment that was a little unnerving. But we got over it and we've been having a great time. God. Oh. Okay, what happened? It was just an event that we got through. - Yeah. That's it. - That was all. It's good to come through events. Exactly. No, we're good now. Yeah, it was nothing. It wasn't nothing. No. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's the wrong word. At all. I mean, it was something. Yeah. We were sitting outside at a restaurant, and there was this huge bang. And suddenly, this wall of snow comes rumbling down the mountain, and it did not look like it was gonna stop. It looked like it was gonna kill us. For a moment. No! No! Absolutely not. Because other people felt exactly the same way. They were getting up. They were screaming. I screamed. And the kids were screaming. Because it felt like this was it. That we were gonna die. Um... And I look over at Pete, and he had jumped up and grabbed his phone. He was gone. Pete ran. Pete left us. I guess in his mind, um, he left us there to get buried, because, um, he could make it away, and we were too far away. You know, we were on the other side of the, uh... I don't know. Anyway, so I throw my arms around my children, and just wait, you know? I just wait for us to die together. Sorry. Anyway, so then, um, moments pass, and oh, my God, I'm still there. And the kids stop screaming. And we're okay, we realize. We're okay. And then Pete comes back, and just orders soup. So... That's intense. Yeah. But, you know, I think... You know, I think in a situation like that... I think it's probably a survival reaction that kicks in. Right, Pete? You don't even have time to think. It's a reflex. It's like when a sea cucumber perceives a threat, it rapidly evacuates all of its organs through its rectum. How could I have possibly run away? - What? - In ski boots? How is that possible? Can you run in ski boots? Wait, what? Zach, can you run in ski boots? - It's not recommended. - Oh, fine. Clomp away. Walk briskly away. I mean... No. You said "run." Rosie, can you run in ski boots? Not very well, but... Boom. Exactly. Regardless, I wouldn't leave my family to die. That's "boom, exactly." No, no, nor would I. And I didn't. It's just she said you did. Yeah, because he did. For fuck's sakes, Billie. Why are you... And I didn't leave you to be buried. - I don't know. - Well, I do. I was there and I saw it differently. So then tell me, Pete. What happened differently? Please. - The snow was coming. - Right. Almost like an avalanche. Oh, now it's not even an avalanche. I checked on you guys visually, and when I made sure that everyone was okay, I ran to get help. Hang on a second. That doesn't even make sense! You knew that we were okay, so you went to get help? What? It happened very fast. It was very confusing. Right. Survival reaction. But I checked to make sure you guys were okay and then I went to get help. That's not what happened, Peter. Billie, I can accept your version of the truth. Why can't you accept mine? Because mine is true and not dumb. - You weren't there with me! - Right! That's exactly right. I was at the table with our children. I just love that you're making me say that what happened for you happened for me. Okay. I mean, Pete, like a lot of times, the people involved in automobile accidents get the events of the accident completely wrong. - Stop pitching theories, Zach. - Yeah, sorry. Fuck. Just come on out here for a sec. Um... Sorry. We just have one question. Billie, no. - Yeah, yeah. - No. You can say... I was talking with our friends about, uh, when we were having lunch, remember? And then the avalanche was coming, and, um, can you say what happened next? They can say. It's for the story and, um, they wanted to know. They can say, right, Pete? Sure. The truth. Um... Dad ran away. And Finn? Is that what you think happened, too? - Mmm-hmm. - Okay. Okay, guys. Thanks. You can go back to your funny movie. They're such great kids. You might have traumatized them, you know that? Oh, I traumatized them? You care so much about being right, don't you? No, I just wanna get this straight. No, you just want to get it right. So, congratulations, Billie, you win. You're right. Everyone give Billie a fucking round of applause. Hey, Pete? You left your family! That I am right about! Hey. Uh, I'm gonna take a solo day today. Oh. Okay. So you and the boys can have an adventure. Yeah, fine. Maybe we'll cross paths on the mountain. Actually, I saw a leaflet for one of those Alpine rail slides. The boys might really enjoy that. It's at the family resort, the one that's just minutes of 20 from here. Great. - Sure. - Great. Oh. Getting an eyeful? Oh. Hello. No, no, no. I was just... And where is your team? Oh, I'm taking a solo day today. Good. Adventure. Just for you. Yeah. Adventure. Fun. Just for you. Yeah. Fun. You want fun? Yeah. Fun. Good. - Oh! - Come. Oh, I think that this is the line right here. No, no, this wait is not for you. Oh. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Oh, great. Well, once again, thank you so much for your help. Adventure, yes? Now? Fun? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All of it. Right. Oh, you're coming? - Yeah. I come with. - Ah. Wonderful. Yeah. So, I am interested on another question. Oh, good. Okay. Have you had varied life of sexual experience? What? I'm sorry? Have you had a varied life of sexual experience? No, no, no. I'm not asking you so that you would repeat that. We're in a public space. I'm just saying. At that age, they rarely bother with the English. Boy, you really get right in there, don't you? I'm sorry. I just don't like so much bullshit all the time. Yeah, I get that. I'm not a fan of the bullshit myself either. - You just seem to me like... - Like what? You haven't been all the blocks around. - Me? - Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. You'd be surprised actually. In college, I had, um, so many boyfriends. I mean, I really knew my way around. I mean, I did my fair share of... I don't like to perform that. Nobody likes it. I just tend to do only what I like. - Mmm. - I masturbate. Every day. Because that is for me. And having sex with guests... Yes, that is very for me. But you're married. Is that right? - Are you? Is that the case? - Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So how does that work with everything? With your Mr. Charlie and whatever other fellow you happen... Easy. I spend the winters here, and in the summer, my husband and I have the farm. And your husband is cool with that? No, my husband, my husband. - What? - Can we shake hands? Now, should I tell my husband about this? Should you? What are you talking about? Our bodies touched. We have a little intimacy. Oh, please. Well, why? Why is there this absurdity? When these two parts of our bodies touch, no big deal. Because it's very... But the other parts, oh, no. No. The bodies touch, the special parts. - Well, yes, they're special. - Oh, my goodness. What shall we do? The god is angry in the heaven, - so the marriage must be over. - Well, no, not that. The special parts have rubbed. It's superstition. It isn't, actually. I mean, for instance, shaking hands doesn't make babies, does it? - Oh, please. - Well. Sex doesn't need to make babies. No, I know that. And you don't need sex to make the babies, yeah? Of course not, but... So, can we all just move on now, please? But what I mean is, is that in a relationship, it seems to me you need to be on the same page, right? I mean, it's like a story, and you both have to be in the same story. Well, I guess I make my own story. Of course, yeah. But... I'm happy. Are you happy? Yeah. Good. Yeah. Then you're happy with your story, and I'm happy with mine. - Okay. - Yes? - Mmm-hmm. - Yes? Yes. I said, "Yes." I said, "Yes." Yes, yes, yes. - Good. - Yeah. I'm a little sore. Mr. Charlie is an animal. Good, we're here. I can't sit. And now, Guglielmo will be your instructor. Wait. What? Who will be my what? Bye-bye. Have fun. You ready? Uh... I don't know. This way. This place is awesome. Yeah. Why aren't we staying here? Yeah. It's fine. I mean, it's different. I don't know if it's better. Just different. Finn! Here it is! Let's go. So. So. Yeah. The first thing of instruction is? I honestly have no idea. I don't... Coffee. Oh. Okay. Buongiorno. Buongiorno to you. So, listen, actually Charlotte said your name very quickly. - I didn't quite... - Guglielmo. It's very simple. "Gu" like Google, "gli" like we, "elmo" like helmet. Um, I... You can call me G. - G. - Yes. G. Just to be clear, I didn't sign up - for an instructor today. - Uh-huh. 'Cause I was gonna just take - a solo day. - Uh-huh. Um, 'cause I'm a pretty decent skier. And why stop at decent? No, I mean... There is better than decent, no? Yes, of course, there's better than decent, yeah. Okay. So, you see this coffee? I do. It's decent. Yeah. - Uh-huh. - Boring. Okay? Oh, hold it? Yes. But... Yeah. A-ha! Alpine coffee. Better. Yeah, that's better than decent, I suppose. Yeah. Okay. Wow. Way better than decent. Mmm. So, thank you for the better than decent. You're welcome. I appreciate it. I'm gonna take off. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Billie. I'm gonna tell you what, okay? Yeah. So, we will ski together a little bit, and then after that if you want to be solo, you be solo. Okay. Good, G. Yes. Give me five. Yes. Finn, buddy, ease up on your brakes! It's no fun if you go slow! You're too close! Buddy, come on! Your brother's way ahead! I warned you. Here I come! Dad, stop! I'm coming for ya! I'm gonna tap you, okay? - No. Don't! - What? Don't! Gonna get you, Finn! I'm gonna get you, bro! - Don't! - Dad's on your tail, bro! Don't! We post rules. You cannot bump. No, I'm sorry. I know, but I barely tapped him. Let's see, they have a toboggan run. Arcade. Uh, indoor miniature golf. Lot of good stuff. Any of that sound good? I don't care. What's up? Doesn't seem like you wanna be here. Of course I do. I love spending time with you more than anything. Right? Is it about the slide? Okay, so Daddy got kicked off the slide, yes. Because Daddy was having too much fun. Okay, you know what? Let's just try to end this day on a high note, all right? And you guys go ahead and pick something right here. Go ahead. We can do multiple things if you want. Can we just have screen time back at our hotel? Sure. I like that, yeah. Yes! Good! Whoa. How about that? That's a lot of work, huh? But good, yes? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So, how do your calves feel? Well, I can feel them all right. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. Good. Maybe you want to, yeah, take them out. Yeah, I think so. For, like, 10 minutes or something. Yeah, my right boot in particular is driving me crazy. They can burn here, no? Yes. You know, sometimes I can give people, on the calves or something, like a rub, you know? Oh. Sometimes you can do that, can you? Yeah. That's something I do. Oh, you do? Yeah. Just to, you know, relax out those tight muscles. It's recommended. Oh, really? Well, if it's recommended, yeah. - Sure. - Let me. Yeah. Sorry, I'm a little sweaty. It's okay. You have nice feet. Oh. So... I'm curious. Yeah? Who is Billie? What? Why is that silly? I want to know. Um... It sounds sort of like a... Well, "who"? How do you even answer? I am very confident, but I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong. I tend to fall in love too fast. Heal too slow. And I love to paint. And actually, I'm very good at it. However, I cannot sing, but that does not stop me from doing it every day. Skiing is a passion, but, you know, just teaching feeds my soul. To witness people surprise themselves, that's what I live for. And, uh, I am the only child of a single mom, and she is my hero. Oh, that's lovely. That's how I answer. You know, you don't have to share with me who you are, Billie. But you must promise me. What? Promise me you're not gonna find it silly if someone wants to make it about you. I promise that. Okay. Um... Thank you very much. I'm sorry. Scusami. I apologize if I... Do not apologize. I did exactly what I wanted to do. Yeah. And now I, uh, wanna ski. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. Okay. But just to be clear, I could fuck you right through that wall right now if I wanted. But I won't. And I wouldn't. That much I know about me. In answer to your earlier question. Oh, my God. Oh. Okay. Ah. There are my gloves. How was your solo day? It was great. Yeah. Awesome. Me and the boys had fun. Good. Yeah, we spent a good while on the slide. Great. That's funny. Morning. - Morning, Dad. - Morning. Hey. Everybody sleep okay? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. - Mmm-hmm. Are we, um... Um, we're just... We're gonna just do this for now. - Okay. - Yeah. Yeah, Zach had texted about joining us. I think Rosie's sleeping in, so... Oh. Great. Okay. Well, you guys have fun. Should we meet up for dinner? Maybe a place in town? Sure. So I'll text you. Okay. Cool. All right. All right, guys. Have fun. - Okay. We will. - You too. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Okay. I like pugs, too. They're just unbeatable. I'm not gonna get over that. Whoo! Yeah! I mean, how great is this? Oh, my God! Look at this. It's like one of those screensavers. We're in a stock image right now. There's only one thing I have to worry about right now. Okay. Only one obligation. And that's going down. - That's it. - Yeah. - Just live your best life. - That's it. Yeah. Every day is all we have. - Fuck yeah, man. - Right? Fucking A. Whoo! Shit! Idiot! Do I seem okay to you? Yeah. I think. You don't think I have a concussion? No, I don't think so, because you didn't puke or anything. No, no, no. No, I haven't felt nauseous. Have I been repeating myself? I don't know. I mean, like, you've asked me a few times if you seem okay. - But that's it? - Yeah. Hi. Hi. - Hello. Hi. - Hi. Hi. Yeah. Uh... My friend just wanted to say hi. - Ooh. - Oh. - Yeah. - Okay. She likes the way you carry yourself. - That's very kind. - Yeah. Yeah, where, uh... Oh, yeah. That's nice. Oh, my God. She thinks you are the best-groomed man in this bar. Well, thank you. Yeah. Uh... Okay. That's okay, right? Check you out. What do we... I mean, do we send a drink over? Should we go, just talk to them? I think for me, you know, with Rosie... No. No, no. Right. I mean, I'm already punching above my weight there, and I don't want to mess that up. Oh, my God, no, you got a good thing. - Yeah. Totally. - Yeah. She's, like, changed my life and I love... Yeah, that's good to hear. I love it. I mean, you know, the whole moving to Europe thing... I don't know if I'd really want to be that far - from my family... - Mmm-hmm. ...and she's pretty adamant about not wanting kids, but me... Right. I don't know. But for now, yeah. Yeah, we're good. Wow. Man, I did not hate that. Oh. Yeah. It's been a while. I used to be good at flirting, too. Really? I mean, really good. Well, you have that energy. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Still? - You do. - Hi. - Hello again. - Sorry. - Hello. Hi. It wasn't you. What's that? It wasn't you. She didn't like the way you carried yourself. - Oh. - It was him. The green man. - Yeah. - Sorry. Hey, so what's your name? Bye. Yeah, she's right. That guy is a catch. Yeah, can I be honest with you, Pete? I do see a resemblance. - No. - Yes. Come on. No, it's okay. Honestly. I'm good. I'm so good. So much so. So, do you feel like skiing more? No. Let's just keep drinking. Billie? Yes? Hey! Oh, hi, guys. - Hi. - You going up? Um, yeah. We... Yes. Do you mind if I...? Oh, sure, yeah. Join us. Absolutely. - Mom. - Yes? Can we go up by ourselves? - Sure, yeah, if you want to. - Yeah, let's do that. Yes! But can you wait for me at the top? Okay? - Yeah, we will. - Okay. Look at this. Yeah. Stunning. The sun is really poking out now. Mmm-hmm. So, how you doing today? Um... I'm better, I guess. Well, I don't know. I am so sorry that you guys were there for all of that the other night. I know that we just met. Why are you apologizing? Well, I shouldn't have involved the kids like that. That was not wise. Okay, fine, but you have nothing to apologize about. What he did was fucked up. Yeah, but... I probably shouldn't have attacked him like that. He's grieving right now. A lot. 'Cause his dad died about eight months ago. People die. It happens. It sucks. But that doesn't excuse why he ran away like a fucking pussy. You don't owe him anything. You have a right to be angry. Thank you. I'll tell you this much. If Zach ever did that to me, I would kick him in the nuts and he would never see me again. It's black and white. Well... I'm not sure. No, it is. It's black and white. How old are you? - Thirty. - Oh. - We're home. - Yeah. Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Hey, green guy. I got it. Got it. Jerk. - Hey. - Hey. You all right? You gotta get some air. This place is dead. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. We should get you out of here. It's almost 7:00. Whoa. Okay. Hey. Okay. - I think it's time for pizza. - No. - Or coffee or something. - No. No. I gotta stay hungry for dinner with my family. So... Yeah. I just think before you see your family, it might be a good idea to get some food. I love my family. - Yeah, I know. - Okay? - I know. - I do. I know. Billie and I didn't even think of doing it for the longest time. Kids. So we did the fertility thing. And then we just said, you know, if science wants us to be parents, then we'll be parents. If not, that's okay. And science made us parents. Yeah, I mean, you got a beautiful family. You lose a parent and the ticking gets louder. I mean, you really wanna know how old you are? Look at your kids. Every day they change. I mean, yeah, we get older. But you can't forget about you. It happens. You think about yourself. Yeah, I know. Hey, Pete. Come here. Pete, we're gonna get you coffee. I know. That's what I said. Right? - Yeah. - Come on. I got you. Yum. Yours? I'm not that hungry. Okay. Did you already eat? 'Cause I didn't eat to stay hungry. So I'm hungry. All right. Mom, keycard. Keycard. Thanks. Billie? Billie, stop. Can I just say something? Please? - Well, I... - Can I? Pete, honestly, it's not a good idea. No, I just... It's really not a good idea to do this right now. Please. Let me just... Billie, just listen to me. What happened is what you said happened. I ran. I didn't know how to make sense of it. I didn't want to. It's not like I didn't see it. I keep seeing it, Billie. I see it now. How you look at me. And how our sons look at me. I hate it. I was just afraid that if I said it out loud, then it would be true. I'm just a selfish coward. Capable of... This is what you say four days ago, Pete. Instead, you made me feel like a complete idiot. Like it was my fault. I can't stop an avalanche, Billie. No one is asking you to stop an avalanche. What are you even talking about? I just want you to want to survive one with us, Pete. Morning. - Thank you. - Thank you. Morning. Morning. Morning. Looks like we got hit with a big dump of snow. Should we, uh, head to the top of the mountain? For a final run? Tackle the Beast? Yeah, sure. Does that sound good? Tackle the Beast? Sure. Unless I decide to go to Switzerland. I hate skiing. - No, he doesn't. - Finn. You're not in my body. It's cold and dumb. You're always wet and it hurts when you fall. It takes forever if you have to go to the bathroom. People are just stupid. They don't look where they're going, so you're always scared you're gonna die. And I have to go to the bathroom. Oh. Hey, hey. It's okay, you guys. It's okay. You're fine. I'm here. You know, I think I'm all skied out. I say we call it. Get some hot cocoa? - Warm up? Yeah? - Yeah. Honey, why don't you go ahead? We'll wait for you, down at the bottom. Come on, guys. Where is she? Pete! Pete! Peter! Stay here. Dad! Just stay right here. Peter! Peter! Hey. You okay? This is for our boys. For how they see you. But as far as you and I are concerned, if you don't like the way that I look at you, then show me something different. You show me someone who really wants to be here. But I do. No, I mean through it all, Pete. Because if you can't, then you can just go down the mountain by yourself. No, I'm here. For all of it. Now rescue me. What happened, Mom? Yeah, are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. She's good. Oh. I forgot my skis. Oh. Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Please, guys, slow. Watch it! Hey! Until we meet in a different lifetime. - Is he talking to you? - Mmm. Yeah, that's, um, my ski instructor. Oh, I didn't know you took a ski lesson. Yeah, I told you that. You did? Wait, what? Hashtag we refuse to leave. - Hi! - Oh, hey! Hashtag not leaving. God. - I am getting so sick of that. - I don't know why that's fun. - Oh, you guys. - Hey. - Safe travels. - All right. You too. Really nice to meet you.
