This is a Police line. An internal competition is going on between each other Who makes more bribe money than the other My father is also a police officer but he is honest. Well, son.. ..goodbye. One's needs can be fulfilled with honesty but not one's wants. The rich have toys to give to their children.. ..while the poor only have stories. And the story my father told me, Give me money, father. Was Unique. - Only ten rupees? - Oh! First you tell me whose picture is on this note. Quaid-e- Azam The great leader. Do you know why? No, father. Because he keeps an eye on us. And when we misuse this money, he gets upset with us. Understand? Yes, father. Remember that. The great leader is watching us. Come here, Gulab. Let's play, carom. 'Remember that. The great leader is watching us.' No. You play. What happened to him? - No. You play. - Get lost! Give me a pack of biscuits, uncle. 'Remember that. The great leader is watching us.' He is so young and you are already scaring him. Good words don't have the same impact on everyone, Sajida. When it rains crops only grow where the farmer has worked hard. Only weeds grow in the other places. - Come here. Come here. - I'm coming. C'mon "Ranjha. Ranjha." "Ranjha. Ranjha." "Ranjha. Ranjha."

He definitely gets upset with people who misuses the notes. My father told me. - What are you saying? - Your father is fooling you.. ..so you don't ask him for money. His father don't take bribe Yes, that's why he is fooling him. Look at him ... so naive Come back, Gulab I believed in the story my father told me ..but stories are always far from the truth.. ..and the truth is close to facts. The fact is that nobody is watching anybody.. ..and everyone takes advantage of this. Now it is up to us.. ..whether we want to give advantage.. ..or take advantage. Let me go, buddy. Nobody is watching. Fork out the money. Gulab? What will people say? You are planning to sell liquor without giving me my cut that too in my area. Hurry. Hurry. Seize all these bottles of honey.

But starting tomorrow you will not make these burgers over here. Why? Such a nice restaurant has opened up across the road. Where will people park their cars when come to the restaurant? That's why take this elsewhere hereafter. Okay? But, my boy, I have permission from the Municipality. Look. I have the documents. You did not seek permission from the Police though, did you, aunty? The Restaurateur is a big shot. He knows people in high places. I have come in plain clothes today. That's why I am talking politely. If I get pressure from above I will have to come in my uniform. Then the Police will use batons and breakage. You will suffer a big loss, aunty. What will people say then? The cart is intact now. So park it elsewhere. You don't need to panic, aunty. Take this. Tomorrow, okay. Yes. What is this? What is all this? - Father, actually.. - Do not lie! Tell me where this money came from. Right from childhood I taught you only one lesson. Honesty. You failed in it. The uniform that made me proud, you wear the same uniform to steal. You take advantage of innocent people's vulnerabilities. I saved up one penny at a time to raise you.. ..and you are accepting that which is dishonest. I spent every moment teaching you about the honor and reverence.. ..of the great leader. How dare you hide your dirty money behind that great leader's picture! Tell me! How dare you! - Tell me. Tell me. Why did you do it? - What is the big deal? What is the big deal if I kept the notes.. ..behind the great leader's picture? Isn't the great leader's picture on those notes? Isn't the great leader's picture on dishonest notes? Are the dishonest and honest notes different? I love the great leader more than you. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. I have placed it with care in so many places. This. This. Over here too. Look at this. Look at this. You ran away from them and I ran after them. You were honest, weren't you? You spent an honorable life, right? What did you gain? What you gain by putting us and yourself through this test? Don't you recall you did not have money for mother's medication? When you raised me on penny's did you ever stop to think.. ..that my small wishes were buried under the mountain of your ego? I said nothing. I never complained once. What do you want now? For me to spend my life like you did. You want me to believe the story you told me even today? I am not ten years old, father. Today nobody knows the great leader you love from that picture of him. They only know him. Him. This is the great leader. Long live the great leader! You are right. You are right. What did I gain from being honest? Because... ...I thought you alone were my wealth.. ..and today you are the one who made me bankrupt. Remember my words. This money will be of no use to you. The story I told you when you were young was not a lie. Move away. Move away. You don't even deserve to have the great leader's picture here. Today.. ..an unfortunate father and you, the father of the nation have failed. The system that I wanted to change... ...has changed my son. People see your picture on the notes.. ...but they forget to read.. ..'Seeking an honest livelihood is an act of worship.' God! God, please perform a miracle that will show everybody.. ..the difference between honest and dishonest. I'm sorry, father. You couldn't sleep all night and I couldn't fall asleep either. I am very ashamed. I should not have spoken to you in that manner. You are annoyed with me, aren't you? I did not mean to break your heart. That's why.. That's why I kept it secret from you. Please forgive me. Father. Father. You cannot leave in this manner, father. Father, you can't.. You can't leave without forgiving me, father. Father. Father. Father.

If only the person could return. If only. But, Gulab, the fact is that the person will not return. Don't say that, madam. Want to go out? - Let's go watch a movie. - No. No. - I don't wish to go out. - Okay. Then let's stay at home. Huh? What will we do at home? What will we do at home? We will chat. We could watch a movie. We shall cook food. Alright, then let's sit here. Here. Let's chat over here. Sit. Sit. Just a moment. - Will we chat here all day long? - Yes. Yes. Any problem with that? We shall chat over here. - Is anyone inside? - Where? - In the room. - No. No. No. Not at all. - Then what was that sound? - I didn't hear it. I didn't even hear it now. I did. From where? Jia. Jia. Look.. Why is the door locked? Look, I can explain, Jia. What can you explain? Who is inside? Nobody is inside. Open the door. - Nobody is inside, Jia. - Hello! - Who is inside? - Nobody is inside, Jia. - Open the door. - Jia. Nobody is inside. Get the door open. Get it open. Open. - Seriously? - No.. No. No. No. No. No. No. We aren't like that, madam. It's just that.. - What is this? - Yes.. - So much money? - The.. the.. - We raided a fake note factory. - Yes. - That's what it is. - That's it. But these don't even have the great leader's picture. - Exactly what they were printing. - They were printing. - We got there on time. - Yes. - Really? We are chasing bigwigs. They are very dangerous. - That is why we are hiding here. - Yes. - It is not safe for you to be here, Jia. - Yes. - Please go home. - That's right. And what about you, Gulab? This is my job, Jia.. ..and would go to any lengths for my duty. Me too. Go to any lengths. Sir, you have fooled madam. At least tell me the truth. - How did this happen? - I told you, Ronaq Ali. The great leader is annoyed with me. Then He should have been annoyed with you. Why did he get annoyed with me? Because you did not believe me. You mean to say the notes of anyone.. ..who doesn't believe will become useless? It's possible. If he has corruption money. How is this possible, sir? I don't understand it. And if it is true then let's test it on someone. On whom? Listen. Stop demanding bribes. The great leader will get annoyed. If he gets annoyed he will disappear from the notes. Yes. And if I get annoyed then you will disappear. Understand? Now get out of here! Hey! What are you doing? I would have fallen. How much further will you fall? Aren't you ashamed of yourself for stealing power? One gets power when one hooks the wire, not shame. All the money you are saving by stealing power will disappear.. ..when the great leader gets annoyed with you. Yes. Mind your own business. Where do these people come from? Why are you adding dishonest money to your honest money? - You silly! Water is pure. But the great leader will get annoyed with you. Huh? Okay. You're back? What is your problem? You don't understand. The great leader is annoyed with you. I am going to beat you. - Check your notes before you beat us. - Yes. Check them. Do it. Huh? Hey! Where have they gone? Hey! Oh Fish... We made a mistake. We should have demanded the bribe in dollars. We would not have had this problem. All our earnings are wasted. What will we do, Ronaq Ali? How will we survive? Sir, we are daily wage earners. We earn daily to eat daily. Idea! Sir. Idea! Hereafter we shall demand things from people instead of money. - What? - Ration, yogurt, milk and fruits. We rob people of food in any case. Else there are so many banquet halls Long live Sindhi biryani! You are speaking nonsense, Ronaq Ali. We demanded bribes so honorably. You want us to become beggars now? Sir, don't you feel we have become beggars? You are single but I have big expenses. My son wants a car and my wife wants gold. How will I fulfill their demands? I am too old. Sir. Ronaq Ali. - Ronaq Ali. - Yes. Wait. Yes, sir. Ronak Ali. yes. Hereafter we will only Use cards, no cash. Fill it up. I bet you aren't accepting the card because you cheat on taxes. We are getting late, sir. We are going to the airport. My cousin has to catch the flight to America. Then I'm sure you have dollars. How much can I cheat on taxes for 50 rupees? 12 dozen eggs, 40 big packers of milk, - 35 kilos sugar. - You dare to argue with a Policeman? I will put you in prison under penal code 803. 65 kilos of basmati rice. Never mind the money, sir. I don't want money from you. Okay, give me five canisters. Give me olive oil. Give me a face massage. I pray that God blesses you both. Give me. I-I-I-I.. I-I-I-I am giving him. I am giving him. - I am giving him. - Hurry up, sir. - Hurry up. - Take this. Huh? I hope you GET destroyed! You accept cards, don't you? Cards are unacceptable. I don't have the machine. So, keep a machine. You have done a very big job for me, sir. You deserve this, sir. I don't want it. - Sir, you have done a big job for me. - I don't want it. - I am happy to give it to you. - I don't want it. - "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" Hello, aunty. I haven't seen your cart for the past 15 days. Is everything okay? It has been 15 days since the Police forced me to move my cart, my dear. They stopped my work. Don't worry, aunty. I know a Policeman. He will surely help us. Just come to Victoria Police station. I tried reasoning with him but.. Who is this? She rode a motorcycle to the Police station. By herself. She is the.. um, what do you call them? From the women's march. Communist. They aren't called communists. Womanist. They are called womanists. Brother, is Gulab here? Yes, it is. Inspector Gulab. - Who are you? - I am his friend. - Friend? - Yes, friend. - Excuse me a moment, please. - Okay. Sir. - What? - A girl is here. She claims to be your friend. What's the matter? Is everything okay? I have very important business with you. There's a problem. There's a lady in Main market. She has a doner kebab cart. She makes the most wonderful doner kebabs. Some dimwit forced her to move her cart from there. - And think about it. She had a permit. - I'll be back in a minute. Listen to me, Gulab. This is the lady. Aunty. Gulab. He will help us. How will he help, my dear? He is the one who forced me to move my cart. He even threatened to shatter my cart. What? It's like this.. it's just that.. actually.. Actually what? You are a liar. You are cheating. You are making a fool of me. - Listen to me, Jia. - Jia what? Don't bother acting anymore. I'm so stupid. - Let's go, aunty. - Listen to me, Jia. I will correct everything. Correct yourself first. Ronaq Ali, you are older than me. Even you didn't try to stop me. May I say something, sir? I hope you won't feel offended. Why would you listen to me when you did not listen to your own father? You're right, Ronaq Ali. I annoyed everyone. The great leader. Father. So much so, even Jia. I don't know what to do. Sir, there is only one solution. We must placate everyone. Quiet. Jia. Jia. Ji.. Why have you come here? Please forgive me, Jia. I forgive you. Go. No, I won't go this way. Just listen to me once. Then I shall leave if you wish. I am not interested in listening to lies. Would you like to listen to the truth? 'Tell me why you did it?' 'What is the big deal if I kept the notes.. ..behind the great leader's picture?' 'Right from childhood I taught you only one lesson. Honesty.' 'You failed in it.' Everything is finished, Jia. I could never be the way.. The way father wanted me to be. I told myself so many lies. I deceived myself. Perhaps that's why Perhaps that's why I did not get the chance to placate him. No matter what I do now, Jia, nothing will be right. You have to make things right. Even if I do, so what? Father won't be able to see. Gulab, we feel that the people in the graves our asleep. We are the ones who are asleep. They are watching everything. Do you know how many people we must have accepted bribes from till date? Why, sir? What's the matter? We must return it to everyone. Sir.. "Mend your ways now, God's child." - Shall I tell you? - "What's gone is the past." You took bribes from all the cases... - ...that are written in red ink. "Mend your ways now, God's child." "What's gone is the past." - Look at the section and make the calculation. - "Your land is no longer unhappy, it is happy." "Your land is no longer unhappy, it is happy." Section 144. - I must have taken at least 50000 rupees. - "Take care of this nation" "What are you preoccupied with?" "How long will you remain astray?" "Go ahead and get on the straight path." "From bribery." "From stealing a few coins." "Free yourself." "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" - The great leader has come. - "Long live the great leader!" One would think the great leader has come on our notes. He will. He just needs to be placated. "Your dreams will change." - "Your aftermath will change." - Section 307. It was a case of misappropriation, sir." - "If your work is honest." - 500,000 "Your aftermath will change." "You must keep your heart happy." "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" This is the balance sheet of your deeds? It looks like the Panama Papers to me. Did you feel ashamed to demand a bribe? Didn't you feel ashamed to give a bribe, sufi? - You recognize me? - I can never forget you. I could not celebrated my wedding night because of you two. Father. Father. Mama is calling you. I'm coming, son. You did not celebrate your wedding night? Was she born on the night of fortune and forgiveness? - Oh.. - Go on a honeymoon. Sorry. Sorry. "How long can you survive.. ..on these pieces of paper?" Sir, you worked so hard to earn this money. - "You can touch any destination." - They were not our hard earned money. - It was their hard earned money. What about our hard earned money? "Loved ones are remembered." "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" - Salary, Ronaq Ali. - "Long live the great leader! - Our salary. - "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" - Long live the great leader! - "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" - "Long live the great leader!" - Sir, why are you so happy? We received our salary. Did you receive it for the first time? - No. I am withdrawing it for the first time. - "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" "Long live the great leader!" Out with it. Hey Oldman Hey! Fork out the money. Sir. I just got here, sir. - Your daily drama never ends, bro. - No, no, sir. Please have a little mercy. I haven't done any business as yet. Your drama never ends. - Shall I get it out of the till myself? - No, brother. No! Get away! Sir. You better give me money now else your business will be stopped! - M I right sir. - Take off your uniform. Excuse me, sir? Take off your uniform. I didn't get it Sir! It is very easy to flaunt your position on Constables like me. Go and beat up your seniors if you have the guts! Those who have ruined the system. I only demand 100-200 rupees. Catch those who demand millions of rupees. Go and beat them if you have the guts. Strip them in front of everyone. You are stripping me. Are you out of your mind? Have you gone mad? What is going on? The public is bound to bully us if a Policeman beats another Policeman. Why did you beat him? Sir, he.. He was demanding bribes, sir. Huh? Did he demand less? Does one have to demand a bribe, sir? Huh? Is a camera running? I hope you aren't recording this. I have made up my mind, sir. I will not accept bribes. And you won't either. You are going to dictate what I will or won't do? Yes, sir. And if you don't listen then I shall tell everyone. What-What.. What will you tell? That you wear the Official uniform.. ..but you work for robbers like Rana Sikandar. You make money for him. You change it from black to white. You hide their dark deeds. The poison coursing down your veins.. ..has spread through the department, sir. From top to down every part has become useless. And you? What are you doing? You are an Inspector but you have made as much money as a Minister.. ..and now you possessed by the spirit of honesty! You are my dog. Every time I ate I threw you a bone.. ..and today you dare to bark at me! Bear in mind when a dog goes rabid and barks at his master, it is shot! And what if the same dog bites his master? Are you feeling very angry? Every time I feel angry, I come here and vent all my anger. How? Oh! That is insanity. - Try it. - No. What do you mean? Try it. You will see it makes a difference. Sorry. Let it come from the heart. It's true. It really made a difference. See? Sometimes there is logic in insanity. In any case, the mind doesn't work in anger. You're right. I should not have lost my temper this morning. The mind doesn't work in anger. Now my mind is working. Look at the things one has to do to get votes. If we get votes this time.. ..then we will keep getting notes for the next 5 years. - But, Mr. Rana, in new Pakistan.. - Sir, Gulab is here. Hey! Let him stay there. Sir, I've kept him there for the past four hours. Send him in. Yes, sir. - But, Mr. Rana.. - It is election time. A small spark can kindle into a big flame. We shall deal with him later. So, doggy, you sniffed your way here? Huh? You were right, sir. I am a dog, sir. I am a scoundrel, sir. I am a very cheap person, sir. I am savage! But, sir, please forgive me. Sir. Please make a recommendation for me, sir. Please, sir. I made a huge mistake, sir. I misbehaved with a person like you, sir. Everything I am today, sir, and the position that I am in.. ..is only because of you, sir. I can't leave you in the lurch, sir. I cannot leave you. Get back! Stop! So your balloon is burst? Huh? You were leaping very high this morning. Has the spirit of honesty left you? What honesty, sir? My business is shut, sir. - Oh! - Sir. I cannot express to you what's going on with me, sir. Sir, I haven't slept for the past two nights. - Oh! - I take ten pills, sir, and yet I cannot fall asleep. I have become insomniac, sir. Sir. But if I tell you even you will lose your sleep, sir. What has happened? No, sir. No, sir. I don't want to trouble you by telling you, sir. Why are you creating suspense? Just tell us simply. You will suffer a big loss if I tell you, sir. You won't be able to take it, sir. Hey, you want to be forgiven, don't you? Tell the truth. It's an order. Sir, if I tell you.. ..you will no longer be in a position to forgive anyone. - Will you tell me or not? - Sir. I'll tell you, sir. - Tell me. - Okay, sir. But you have to make me a promise first, sir. Look, sir. You must believe me, sir. You won't make fun of me. Okay. Okay, alright. Alright. Then tell us the correctly and tell us the truth. I promise you I will not make fun of you. - Sure, sir? - Yes, yes, sure. You know, sir, that my father was an honest Officer. During my childhood he told me a story, sir. He used to say.. And one day the great leader disappeared from my notes. Sir. You promised me, sir. Sir. Sir. This is cheating. Don't make fun of me, sir. Sir. Sir. Please stop, sir. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You dimwit! Go to the Doctor. I will pay the fees. Because your notes are useless Its ok if You don't believe me Even I didn't believe it. Sir.. Oh. Thank you. Big people, big heart. Thank you, sir. Sir, I gave you a massage and you are duping me? What? Yes. Gulab! Hey, listen. What are these preparations for? For Mr. Rana's election procession. This time we will take Mr. Rana's procession. Dance. Dance. Tell me the truth. What is the game? Whose hand is behind this? Withdraw your hand first. This is a uniform. Look, Gulab, tell me nicely. How will the notes get corrected? Look, I have handled it so far. If the great leader on these notes doesn't return.. ..then this will make you disappear. - There is one solution. - What? You will have to apologize. From whom? Come on. Begin. Come on! Please forgive me, sir. I made a mistake. I am feeling ashamed. I won't do it again. If you ask in this manner you won't even get alms. How can you get forgiveness? Put your heart into it. Nicely. Plead. Remember all the corruption you have indulged in. Come on! Great leader, please forgive me. I am very dishonest & Corrupt. I have robbed this country. I am telling the truth. I did not spare anyone. Neither children's schools, nor the poor. Neither the hospitals, nor the parks. I bled everyone. He's Right Please come back once. Everything will be okay. I will not make this mistake gain. Babaji. You are aware, Babaji, how helpless the Policemen are. We have to do what their orders. Please forgive me this time. I promise you, Babaji, I shall offer two sheets of flowers for your grave. Yes. I will make a gold chandlier made. Get up. Let's go. These notes will get back to normal, won't they? You have to do one last thing. What else do I have to do? Return the money to the people who it belongs to. Sir, the money belongs to the public. It is public money, return it to the public. The great leader will return. Hello. Long live Rana Sikandar! Long live Rana Sikandar! - Long live Rana Sikandar! - Silence please. Long live Rana Sikandar! Respected Speaker, the subject that I am about to discuss.. ..might be offensive to some of our friends sitting over here. Quite possible they will make fun of me. Sir, have we thought about the fact that this money.. ..for which we work so hard, it has the great leader's picture on it.. ..and this is how we are showing our respect for it? Think about what he must be feeling.. ..when he sees his picture squandering in prostitute houses.. ..or being used for drugs.. ..or seeing it distributed in the name of bribery and commissions. But now it is time think of proposing the removal of his picture.. ..from the notes to maintain his lofty position. Lest he gets annoyed with us permanently and leaves these notes. Order in the house, please. Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Cancel the celebration. I don't understand what has happened. Come to Rana Sikandar's house immediately. - Why didn't you convert it into dollars? - I'm sorry. Will you father make compensate for this loss? Excuse me. You too. What is this, Rana? What kind of a ploy have you made? The other day in the Assembly.. ..you said that the picture will disappear from the notes. The picture disappeared. Which magic wand do you have? If I had a magic wand I wouldn't simply make the picture disappear.. ..I would make the entire note disappear. What do you mean? I mean that all of us are nude in this bathroom. What happened with you has happened to me as well. But it's good. As always we shall unite to resolve this. How will we resolve it? Will we print the picture on it? No. We shall unite to get the picture taken off. Get the great leader's picture taken off the notes. How is it possible? This won't be so easy, Rana. People will come out on the streets. People will surely come out on the streets. Not against us, rather in favor of us. How's that? This time we will protest against corruption. If we want to catch people with black money.. ..we must bring in new notes. On hearing this people will go crazy advocating for us. In any case the public hates our wealth more than their own poverty. And what if they find out? The public.. ..only realizes.. ..the difference between cheating and heating once it has happened. Let us inform you that deliberations are being made for removal.. ..of the great leader's picture from notes in the near future. The reason for this change is the crushing.. ..of the great leader's honor and sanctity due to misuse of the notes. It is found that all the parties are of the same opinion on this issue. Jinnah is our leader. Who will uphold his honor if not us? We get sentimental about everything. Changing the notes is a practical solution. Have you seen how people throw notes around at weddings? And when the same money is trampled by people you cannot bear it. Look, there is one more advantage of changing the notes. And all the black money will go to waste. The Country's economy will become better. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to stay in your show. I don't want to stay. Okay The surprising thing is that this suggestion was made by a Politician. What are you saying? It is found that the public is angry. They claim that.. Tell me something. You have the great leader's photo in your house. One in my house too. It is found in every Government institutes and office. If the public wishes to express its love to the great leader.. ..they should remove his picture from notes.. ..and put it up in their homes, offices and schools. They should love the great leader, not the notes. Look, a good idea should be appreciated no matter who it comes from. Corruption is the greatest tragedy in our country. One thing is certain economic reform will come after this decision. - Hello. What is the problem? - There is no problem. - Protocol has been imposed. - Can't you see there's an ambulance at the back? Once Minister Cars passes by we will let the ambulance go. It will take a little time. Be patient. - What is this? - All clear. Let them come. Hey, madam. Madam. Madam! What? Who do you think you are? Are we your servants? Your life is precious but we are here for free? You don't know the meaning of basic rights. You have no shame. You are troubling human beings as well as animals. It's like this. Be it the city or the jungle, I am in the Government. Neither will your life be spared by me nor will the animals. What the hell Don't come in front of me again. they will shoot you. Sir, I think we need to increase security in the red zone. Elections are nearing and I think it's necessary.. Oh! Sir. Sir, I told him a meeting was going in inside.. ..but he isn't listening to me. - Hmm. - Sir. I'm sorry, sir. I need five minutes from you. It's very important, sir. Wait outside. We will talk after the meeting. It will be too late by then, sir. I want a search warrant for Rana Sikandar's house, sir. What? I need a warrant to search his house, sir. But for what? Sir, I have information that he has concealed millions of illegal rupees. Gulab, you are being overambitious. This is not your job. The Government has made departments such as anti-corruption.. ..and for this purpose. This is not the job of the Police. Then what is the job of the Police, sir? What is our job, sir? Saluting to the Minister. Escorting their vehicles or providing security to them? Slaving for their wives, children and relatives? Or restrain the public on the streets for hours.. ..to save five minutes of their time? Sir, for long the Police have been doing the job that's not theirs. And if we wish to do something we are prohibited, sir. Sometimes under pressure of a phone call from someone.. ..and other times under political pressure. Sir, they always have their way with the Police. A five year old Minister wields more power than a cop of 25 years, sir.. ..because Officers like you restrain us. Oh no, sir. I will not be stopped today, sir. I will not be stopped today. Mr. Rana, move the money to a safe place. Gulab is gone crazy. If he gets hold of even one note.. ..your whole conspiracy will backfire. If you are fond of lions get a stuffed toy. Spare the animals in the jungles. If you are fond of lions get a stuffed toy. Spare the animals in the jungles. Animals have as much right to freedom as all of us do. We must ourselves build the kind of world we want to live in. The lives of animals are important just as our lives are important. Do you think that the animal he has brought from jungle.. - ..is happy in this grand mansion? - No! - Is it happy in this grand mansion? - No! - Is it happy in this grand mansion? - No! This is how children turn out if they study in English Medium schools. Social media has turned everyone into an activist these days. Someone should explain to her it must be enjoying himself inside. A lion is not a decoration piece to be kept at home for personal pride. It get meat to eat without having to hunt. It must be sleeping in an AC room. Feel how hot it is here. - Go to the jungle. - Release the lion! Gulab, I want to make a report against Rana Sikandar. He has a lion in his house and that is illegal. I will go and release it in the jungle. That's where he belongs. Will you go to his house? File madam's report, Salim! It is time to barge into Rana Sikandar's house. Mr. Rana, the Police have barged into the house.. ..and Gulab is with them. Stop him. He must not get into the basement. Yes, sir. Yes. Hey! Nobody can enter this house without Mr. Rana's permission. Whose permission will you seek when your Mr. Rana goes to prison? Make way! We are here to raid the place, not to ask for charity. He is right. He does not ask for charity. He does business. Grease his palms. He will cool down. Although he isn't worth more than 100-200 rupees. Even you weren't worth more than a meter reader, Rana. Everyone knows how you went from 100-200 rupees billions of rupees. Gulab! How dare you! You are crossing your limits! How dare you enter this house without an order! Go. Go. Good boy! Go. Else I shall suspend you right now. Go! Go. Didn't you hear the order? I heard it but I guess you didn't see this. You should have read it, Rana. Search warrant? What? You have come to take the lion. You think you can barge into the house.. ..just because you brought a search warrant? You have come to take the lion. Take it. Sheru! It does not state alive or dead on the warrant. If you shoot it is an attack.. ..and if I shoot it is a competition. Think about it, Rana. You may rest easy, sir. I won't tell anyone. After all the Police's honor is at stake. Long live Sindh Police! Long live Sindh Police! Long live Sindh Police! Long live Sindh Police! That's right, friends. This is the power of social media. It helped free a lion from the Minister's home. Now we have to see if how the lion will be freed in the jungle, friends. We brought this but what about him? We had to free this and imprison him. A strong cage needs to be made else the cage will be broken. Sir! Breaking news is being aired on TV. According to fresh reports the fire at Rana Sikandar's house.. ..has been controlled. The Fire Brigade's timely action.. ..has saved Rana Sikandar's house from grave damage. - The reason for the fire is.. - Could he have burned the money? No. He burned his house to protect his money. Let's find out from Habib, our representative. Habib is present on the scene. Yes, Habib. Tell us about the scene over there. Habib, can you hear me? It appears as though we have lost connection with our representative.. ..but stay with us. - Ronaq Ali. - Yes, sir. - Bring out the vehicle. - Okay. Else, what will people say? What's the matter? Where are you going? You go and release the lion in the jungle.. ..and I shall escort Rana to jail. Hey! Why haven't you worn your helmet? - Sir, I forgot. - The helmet. - Come on. Get off. Get off. - Sir. Come on. Get off. Come on. My bike, sir? Move. Move. Move. Move. Get back. Get back. Make arrangements for my immediate departure. I want a safe exit. Yes, sir. I'll make the arrangements. Sir. We have arrived at the airport. Come. Where did you bring me? Where I should have brought you long ago. Everything gets into place in due time, Rana.. ..and your time has come. Scoundrel! Who do you think you are? I'll call your father right now. You will personally escort me! Rana. Phones don't work in jail. The fire was only a front. All the money has been transferred into a plane via the Fire Brigades. Rana doesn't want someone else to get hold of this money.. ..before the notes are changed. But now the Police's honor is at stake. You must stop this airplane, Gulab. Else what will people say? What do you think of that? Scoundrel! Snake in the grass! Are you in the position? You can put me in jail? You won't be able to keep me in for more than two minutes. Don't forget, you two.. ..you have been living off my scraps. You are being clever with me? Me? I am far cleverer than you. I shall have you stripped of your uniforms.. ..and make you my guards or my name isn't Rana Sikandar. Wow, sir. That was fun! My flight is ready. I want to go to the airport. Why are you crying, Rana? We are sending you. Look. I'll show you right away. Here's your passport. Look at it. It has exit stamped on it. And here's your boarding pass. According to this you have boarded the airplane. The flight will take off in 15 minutes. After that you won't be able to leave the country.. ..nor return to the country. You will regret this, scoundrel! This will cost you dearly My workers will rally in the streets. They will set fire to the entire city. People love me very much. - They won't forget me so easily. - Who will remember a leader like you? You have only drained the country. They will only remember the person who formed the country. The great leader. Long live the great leader! Congratulations! Wow! You got a promotion and your salary has increased too. Who will I spend on all by myself? I have nobody at home either. Let's get married then. What will people say? The girl proposed. Will you marry.. Gulab. Yes. Cutie! "Chaos. Chaos. Chaos. Chaos. Chaos. Create a chaos." "Tantrum. Tantrum. Tantrum. Tantrum. Tantrum. A tantrum took place." "She broke the lock on my heart." "She made me bankrupt." "She came like a tsunami and swept me away." "She whirled me around like a cyclone." "She caused an earthquake." "The Policeman got robbed." "In the middle of the market." "I saw your photo for the first time." "The Policeman got robbed." "Listen policemen, its not required" "To cast an evil eye on my photo."
