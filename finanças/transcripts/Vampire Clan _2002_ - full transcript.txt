Your first encounter with the ones who make you feel a chance to taste their disease. Invite you in to lick their skin, press open and to feel all is real. Your senses low, your pleasures grow White hands sew up the deed. Another limb to lift your skin, press open. Had to dream it was real. With your hands wide open. Lick your wounds and come inside. With your hands wide open. Lick your wounds and come inside. With your hands wide open. As the cord pulls tighter. As the cord pulls tighter. Come inside. [KICK ME KATE, "BOYFRIEND IN A BOX" ON RADIO] Boyfriend in a box. He's out about again-- I got to go. I'm going to be late. No you're not. Shit. I'm already late, Tony. We've got time. No, I really don't. This will only take a sec. As romantic as that sounds, I think I'll pass. Sorry. It's your loss. Do you know what a tease is? I do. And I'm not one. My parents think I'm at work. Don't be mad. This weekend. I'm not mad. Yes you are. Don't be. This weekend. Ow. Aww. I got to go. Tony, it's Jen. Yeah, I'm home. No. I'm calling on my cell. I don't know. My phone line is cut. I think my mom and my sister are fighting about collect calls again. No. My dad was asleep. He'll never know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. OK. All right. I just wanted to tell you I got home, OK? And Tony? Don't be discouraged. This weekend. Love you. Bye. I'm starving. Dad, wake up! 911. I need an ambulance. It's my parents. - Calm down. I think they're dead. Are they still breathing? No! They're my-- I can't get that close. It's my parents. Did somebody do this? Are they still in the house? Hello? Ma'am? Ma'am, are you still there? Ma'am? Upstairs bedroom. Come on. Get up there. Whew. You ain't seen her all night? No, sir. She wasn't here when I got here. I haven't heard from her. You got it there? Much obliged. You just drink this, Jeni. Warm yourself up. Everything's going to be all right. Turns out that there's a younger sister, name of Heather. Ain't been seen all night. I think we might have been kidnapping on our hands. We're going to find her little sister, Jeni. Need a bit of your help. Yes, sir. Sheriff Dane? Not now, Reynolds. All due respect, sir, I think now is the right time. She wasn't kidnapped. She ran away with them. [OFFICE PHONE RINGING AND CHATTER] Who'd she run away with? Rod Farrell and some of his friends. Scott something or the other and two girls from Kentucky. Long way from home. Even farther now. Why would they do something like this, Jeanine? You wouldn't believe me. Try me. Because they're vampires. Whoa, whoa. Hold on, sister. Right this way. This is the mother. Second victim? You don't need to run some more tests? You know, check her out-- - In due time, deputy. Second victim, please. You know, for what it's worth, I put time of death about two hours ago, but that's just me. Yeah. Do me a favor, Deputy Johnson. - Yeah. Just show me the second victim, would you? Sure thing, doc. Meet your second victim. That's the second one. Yeah. Thank you See, he ain't got much of a face there. Yeah. I can see that. Mr. Wendor suffered 22 wounds to the skull and brain. That was the cause of death. Ruth? Mrs. Wendor put up a bit of a fight, it seems. Is that a fact? Not good enough, unfortunately. The brain stem was almost completely lacerated all the way through. Come again? She was practically decapitated. Sheriff, these people weren't murdered for the sake of stealing a car. - No? - No. It was more than that. It had to be, for this degree of brutality. I mean, whoever it is had some kind of bloodlust. Definitely. Oh, there's an officer. What's it look like out there? Oh, typical circus. Do we have any idea where the daughter is at this time? Do we have any idea-- Care to join me Mm-mm. Not if my life depended on it. I have a statement I'd like to make, please. Can I please make a statement. Please, y'all settle down. As of right now, arrest warrants are being issued for Roderick Justin Farrell, Howard Scott Anderson, Charity Lynn Keesee, Dana Lynn Cooper, and Heather Ann Wendorf. What caused you to make the daughter a suspect? Rumor has it that this was a kidnapping. I have no comment on those details at this time. Is it true that the killers were vampires, that they killed the Wendorfs to drink their blood? Sheriff Dane, are the killers vampires? Whatever they are, we're going to get them. Do we have any ideas where the daughter is at this time? Do we have any idea what happened to the parents? Howard Johnson. Yeah. Yeah, I'll give you the number. It's 555-9847. Got it. Hey, Bill? We got them. You got it? Yeah. This one right here. All right. Yeah, Mickey. You can bring them in now. Don't come in too hot, OK? Follow our lead. All right. Everybody down. Everybody on their knees right now with your hands in the air. All right, everybody, don't move. Put your hands on your head. Happy Thanksgiving. All right, everybody. Don't move. Stop. Stop moving there. You stop. Put your hands in the air right now. Don't move, young man. You are asking for it. You little shit. Please, kill me now. Get down. Don't you understand? I cannot be stopped. Yeah? There are no earthly means by which you guys can bind me. I'm sure you think so. Well, you've got the police now, OK? Oh. You know what? You are in a great deal of trouble, my friend. Come on. We have you now, all right? Will you relax now, please? So that we can talk? OK, everybody? Come on. Take him out. Shake until your master calls you. Shake until your mother bleeds. Until you suckle from the one who feeds. Would you like to be famous? What's that? I like you, Officer Dewey. So what is it exactly that you're getting that? Do you have any idea what I've done? Do you have any clue who I am? I suggest you sit back and keep your mouth shut. I need to see my girlfriend. Maybe. She's pregnant with my baby. I said maybe. You let me see her, I give you guys full confession. Full confession, right now. Full fucking confession. Come here. Full confession. - We'll see about that. Full confession. World famous Officer Dewey. Little ring to it, doesn't it? Huh? Mwah. Mwah. Looking for Ben Odom. Well, you found him. - Mike Dane. - Sheriff Dane. Good to see you. Glad you could make it. Follow me. You offer an audience, I see. Hey, Rod, this here is Sheriff Dane from Lake County. He's a might interested in what you've got to say. I always did enjoy an audience. Well, I, uh-- I think an audience deserves a good story, wouldn't you say? Where do you want me to start? Well, why don't you start by telling us about the Vampire Hotel? Vampire Hotel. It was at a place called the Land Between the Lakes up in Kentucky-- a place where we could be ourselves. That's where our coven first came together. It was a spiritual place. It was our place, man. Wearing me down. Oh how low, just to waste my time thinking of you. Nobody could touch us there. You're tearing me down. Down and low-- It was place we could really be ourselves, you know? You had to go somewhere to be yourself? We weren't exactly prom king and queen, you know? No? I'm sure you already knew that. Well, I had a sneaking suspicion. But what I'm wondering, Rod, is this. Why-- why were you so much different than everybody else, hmm? What made you so different? I guess it all goes back to the beginning-- the very beginning. Tell me, officers. Have you ever heard of a black mass, hmm? Educate us, Rod. It's how I came into this world. I mean, it's bloody sacrifice and physical abuse. You talking about your mother, right? She's been accused of some very ugly things, isn't that right? Like that incident with Jayden's little brother? Is that what you're talking about? Well, who's, uh-- who's this Jayden? He's this rival vampire, or so he believes. Personally, I question his reality. But, you know, my mom, she thought by being crossed over by Jayden's little brother would get her what she wanted. She's embarrassing. I mean, clearly-- clearly, you can understand why I had to get away from her. Oh, of course. You were trying to run away from her. Of course. I understand that. Is that you were, uh-- is that why you were down in Florida? Me, Scott Anderson, Dana, and Charity all fucking hopped in Scott's dad's car and fucking took off. So we went down to Florida to pick up my girlfriend Heather. You know, that place can't hold us anymore. Gotta make the bells still when we get to New Orleans. You're turning on your terrorvision. You OK, Charity? Channel 1, 2, 3. Do you think he loves her? Rod loves many women and many women love Rod. That's just the cross he bears. - Shut up, Scott. Charity, talk to me. Are you OK? That's all right. You don't have to talk right now. Everything's a little bit weird. Yeah. This is a mystical journey we're on. And things are strange on a spiritual plane. Didn't I tell you to shut up, Scott? We got a freak show coming. Hey, Rod, do you want a cigarette? I'll be honest with you, man. Charity was less than thrilled to see my ex-girlfriend, Heather. But honestly, who gives a fuck? I didn't. It's a laugh. What's so funny, Scott? Hey, Rod, can we talk? When we stop, can we talk? It's important. Hey. Make a right up ahead, all right? While I plant a seed of violence into every little head. Hail to the freaks! We got a freak show coming. I remember the sun. Yeah. The sun was coming up. What about, uh-- what about Heather Wendorf? What about Heather Wendorf? Called her up, told her to cut class and meet me in the woods. She didn't mind cutting class? As far as I can tell, cutting class is the number one pastime in Eustis. Is that right? Huh. Hey. What are you doing? Nothing. Are you cutting class? No. Yes you are. You're totally cutting class. Yeah. Well, so are you. You better not tell mom. I think I'd resist the urge. You want a ride or something? No. All right, then. Later, gator. I've been waiting for you. How long have you been here? Not long. 5,000 years. OK, that's long. Not to me, it's not. It's been a speck in time. A moment's passed. Jeez. I thought it was a long walk over here. And to a mortal, I'm sure it was. In fact, it must be Thursday. Drink in my blood, Heather, and soon, you will cross over. Cross over? Into the realm of the vampire. You will be immortal, just like me. You know, Rod, I don't know if I believe in that kind of stuff. It just doesn't seem real. Really? Did that feel real? No. It will. Soon, it will feel more real than anything you've ever felt before. You know, Rod, I'm not sure how this is all going to work. How what will work? Running away. Getting out of here. I mean, my parents would never let me leave. We'd have to kill them first. Would you like me to kill your parents for you? No. God, no. Of course not. I could do it. Rod, I was just saying-- I know what you were saying. Where are you going? Rod? Are you going to call later? Rod, where are you going? Diet Coke makes you hungry? So is that-- that's your secret, huh? Mmm. Mmm. It does. It does. I'm sure it does. Where you folks from? Here. There. Rod. Yeah? Can we-- can we go outside and talk? There's nothing you can say to me that they can't hear. We're all family here. That's kind of want I wanted to talk to you about. I wanted to tell you sooner, but I-- Pregnant? This is coming at the worst possible time, Charity. Do you know that? Huh? God. Fuck. God. What are you doing? We are one. We are one. We are one. We are one. We are one. One soul, one life force, one. One. One. Heather, I'm Sheriff Dane. I know. My parents voted for you. I wish I could thank them for that. I truly do. Now, suppose you tell me what happened. I'll tell you what I know. Good enough. Rod told us we had a week, but suddenly that changed. Rod was the only one who really understood, who really knew what I was going through. Everything all right, honey? Everything OK? Honey? Heather, answer your mother. What? Sorry. I just want to know if everything's all right. I guess. The reason that I ask, honey, is that I know that you were not in Mrs. Albrandt's class today. Whoa. You skipped class? I just want to know why. Had female problems. OK. Oh, jeez. Hello? Yes she is. Hold on. It's for you. I'll take it in my room. Female problems? You going to let her get away with that? Hello? Dad, I got it! No, honey. Well, who's she talking to? It's going to be OK. She's not Jeni. I know. Is everything OK, Rod? Something wrong? No. Nothing. Things have simply just become a little bit more-- --urgent, that's all. We leave tonight. Tonight? But you told me we had a week. The spirit world has beckoned us. Their timetable does not coincide with that of the mortal world. We must-- we must-- obey their wishes. I need you. Well, have you spoken to Jeanine? Of course. I need time. For what? I need time to say my goodbyes. Say them quickly. And remember, time waits for no transient souls. What's this? Where's the remote? I've got a job. Hmm. The estrogen in this house is overwhelming. Fine. Watch what you want. You don't have to go. Hey. What are you looking at? My own high school yearbook. Is that you? Sure is. You look-- Eh, well, I get better with age, don't you think? Wouldn't argue. Where's mom? Upstairs. Mom, I'm sorry about skipping school. "Dear mom, dad, and Jeni, I don't have very much time, but I must say that I love you all very much. I'm leaving for good, but I don't want you to worry about me because I'll be fine. I had to go with Jeanine because she needs someone to look after her. Please don't try to find us. Just know that I'll miss you and I'll always love you. Heather." The plan was simple. Wait till Heather leaves, then we go steal her parents' car. When I get to New Orleans, I will prey upon the fallen. You can find me-- There she goes. Dark master, open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Come on, Heather. Don't back out on us now. Scott. Scott. Hey, man, I need you to fucking focus. Can you do that for me? I'm focused, man. I have a gift for you, Scott. No shit? What is it? By communing with me now, we will transcend this reality. We will cross to a spiritual realm-- the realm of vampires. And we'll be more powerful than any mortal we shall encounter. Now we drink freely of each other's soul-- each other's blood. The challenge is ahead of us. It looks us deep in the eyes. Are you strong enough to take that challenge? I'm strong enough. OK. Now follow me to our destiny. No way. How we going to get in? How we going to get in? How we going to get in? Shut the fuck up for a second. - How we going to get in? - All right. All right. All right. There it is. Nice. This is our ride. This is our ride, man. It's unlocked. Let's go. Rod. Let's go. You ready? Should we back it out and try and be quiet? We should just go. Uh, Rod? Are you done? Looks like we're just going to go inside and get the key. Stop. Let's not be foolish. What are you doing? What we're doing is we're walking into that house and taking exactly what we need. Are you ready? I'm ready. Are you ready? I'm ready. I'm going to take the father. You take the mom, all right? Beat her in the head. That's not going to do. What happens if the old man has a gun, huh? You ever think of that? I didn't think so. No. We need something metal. Yeah. This is it. Let's go. Come on, Heather. Get in. Where's Jeanine? Get in the car, Heather. Where's Johnny Rod and Scott went ahead to get her. They're picking her up? Yeah. They just thought it'd be best if they went ahead and helped Jeanine. We'll all be meeting up soon. I just wanted to go with them. Yeah. Well, we got to hurry because Rod, you know, and Jeanine, they're waiting for us. Let's go. Nice bear. So you went ahead and got in? I didn't think-- I didn't know that-- You thought that Rod and Scott were out picking up Jeanine. Nothing about that struck you as odd? It all struck me as odd, Sheriff. It freaked me out. Why didn't you get out, then? Tried to. I tried. It's just, with Rod, you can never really just say no. I know it sounds crazy, but I trusted him. I really did. Hey, guys, I think I forgot something in my room. Easy. There's nothing you could have forgotten that Rod can't provide. What? You brought seven suitcases. Shh. Shut up. Do you hear that? - Hear what? Shh. Listen. I need you to go check that noise out. Scott, focus. I need you to go check out that noise. This is taking too long. She must have changed her mind. I have no idea what you're talking about. The guys went to go get Jeanine, remember, Dana? There they are, so chill. It's my folks. What's going on? Why are they in my parents' car? Relax. Just needed a better car. It's all part of the plan. Plan? What plan? Charity, stop the car. We're not stopping. No. Stop the Explorer. Flash your lights or something. Just relax, all right? Yeah. Yeah. Mmm! Let's see what you got. Boring. This-- this, however, will be very useful. That's why I grabbed that stuff, man. Those pearls. I knew that other stuff was junk. Something really bad must have happened. Nothing bad has happened. Charity, flash your light. We have to go back. Make them stop. Honk your horn or something. Little piss, just freaking relax, OK? We'll stop later. No. Make them stop now! Shit! Cops. It's just the girls, man. They're flashing their lights. I think-- I think they want us to pull over. Relax. Is she telling them? Dana, we have to go back. I have to tell him. Hey, hey, hey. Charity will handle it. Just sit back and relax. Charity, what's going on? Are we going back? Did you tell Rod that my parents are going to freak out when they find their car gone? Yeah. And what did he say? Nothing. What's Scott doing? Why is he switching the license plates on our car? So the cops can't run our plates if we get pulled over. The police? Are you serious? Hey, look at me. We have taken a bold step forwards. You know that? Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah? I know that. All right. All right. Remember this. Our coven in New Orleans, they're going to be grateful. Grateful to you for your contribution to them. Make her chill out, will you? I'm trying. Heather, listen. You got to relax, OK? We just needed a better to get us to New Orleans. It's going to be just fine. - No. I can't do this. We have to go back. What the hell is she doing? How the hell am I supposed to know? She wants us to pull over again? Pull over. I said pull over. I want to put an end to this shit right now. God. What the hell is going on here? What's he saying? You know Rod. The usual. Well, what's he telling her? You don't think you're the only one. Come on. We're all family now, right? It's not about you anymore. It's about what's best for the family. Get out of the car. We're ditching it. - Good. Let's just go back and forget this whole night. I don't think you understand me. What do you mean, then. We're ditching the car. This shitty rust bucket is just slowing us down. Grab your stuff. We're all riding in the Explorer. Rod, this is a bad idea. - What is? - This. Taking my parents' car. They're going to kill me when they find out. They're not going to find out. They'll find out. Trust me. They'll find out and they'll kill-- Shh, shh, shh. Trust me, all right? Your parents are never going to know. All right? OK? All right. Whoa. What the fuck are you doing? What? This is my stuff? It's too much shit. You can't take all that. I need it all. All of it? Yes. Here. Let me help you. All right, gimme. All right, hold on. Rod. What are you-- Rod! Give me the fucking bags. Forget it. Fuck you! Fuck it. Fuck it. Ah, yeah! Well, if you all your stuff, we can wait until you go and get it. No? I want to go back. It's too late for that, OK? We can't go back. No. There's-- there's still a chance. We can go back. My parents might not even find out about us stealing their car if we just turn back now. We can't go back, all right? Even if we wanted to. - Do you want to? - Heather. Do you want to go back? I mean, if we just went over to Jeanine's, she could talk him into stopping. We're not going to Jeanine's, OK? I don't even want to do this without her. Don't you understand that my parents are going to kill me? Your parents aren't going to find out. What's that supposed to mean? Look, to put it bluntly, Heather, your parents are dead. Charity, that's not funny. I don't know where we are when I woke up the next day, but something in Rod had changed. It was like I didn't even know who he was anymore. Aww, fuck. Fuck. What the fuck! What's up? Something's wrong with this fucking Explorer. That's what's up. What do you mean? I don't know. It's driving fine, then it's slowing down, and driving fine, slowing down, sputtering. It's because it's out of gas, moron! God. That was so fucking stupid. Don't start with me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Hey, shut the fuck up. - Idiot. Hey. Shut the fuck up, all right? I'm so sorry, man. I wasn't paying attention. Hey. Momentary lapse of senses. Don't let it happen again, all right? Don't fucking let it happen again. Jeez. What are we going to do? What? What are we going to do? We're going to go get gas now. It's going to be a hell of a walk. Hey. Where are you going? I'm going to get gas. No, no, no, no. No, no. You stay here. You watch the girls. Dana and I are going to go get the gas. Let's go. - What? There's nothing here for miles. There's nothing here for miles. Let's go. Don't let anything fucking happen to them. Do you understand me? - I got you. - Huh? - I got you. - Do you understand me? Yeah. All right. Let's go. Let's go. That's Rod's seat. I don't see him sitting in it, do you? Just don't be sitting in it when he gets back, that's all. You really are scared of him, aren't you? I'm not scared of him. You're scared to death of him. God, you're scared of everything. I am not. You're scared of me. I am not scared of you. I've got powers. Rod's given me powers as a vampire and stuff. And-- and I am not scared of anything. I can feel your powers weakening. My powers aren't weakening. I am draining you-- your powers. Whatever. You don't know what you're talking about. And another thing-- what the fuck are you doing! The fuck does it look like. I'm going home. What's so funny? It's just funny. It's just funny. It's just funny, that's all. How do you like it! How does that feel! Is that funny? I'm-- I'm sorry. It's a strange new world. If you've begun to cross over, soon you'll understand. What do you mean? You need to drink. See, you have to be strong when you cross over to become a vampire. Drink. You need your strength. Drink. Shit. The cops. Man. The cops. I knew it. Fucking dead, man. Shit. Relax, Scott. Just be cool, OK? Don't blow it. How you doing, officer? Everything all right here? No, sir, it's not. No. No. If it was, wouldn't need this, right? Charity, what are we going to do? We're so busted. We are screwed. We're going to to get arrested. You know, these things are real gas guzzlers. You wouldn't believe it. I believe it. Yeah? This one time, I used to have this Buick, right? And it was old just like this. Eh, you expect a car like that to do you wrong, you know? But a car like this-- You into automobiles, son? Yes, sir, I am. - You are? - Yeah. Got a V8 on that? I wish. Six, but gets the job done. Ah, six. Yeah. All righty. All righty. Have a Happy Thanksgiving. Hey, you too. It is so funny how they go through all this effort of wearing their uniforms and carrying their weapons, when clearly-- I mean, fucking clearly, they are no match for my powers. I mean, come on. It is so clear to me now that our family cannot be stopped. When we go to New Orleans, our coven-- we form and we mutate. And perhaps, we might even be able to forge a coexistence with the lupine lures of New Orleans' eastern side. What's a lupine? It's a werewolf, dumbass. Fuck off. I wasn't talking to you. Fuck you. Can werewolves and vampires really do that? Today, I am absolutely sure anything-- anything-- can happen. I have a present for you, Heather. What the fuck are you doing with those? Those are my mother's. Huh? Were your mom's. A symbol of your past life. Help me. Help me. Let me stop you right there. Just let me get some things straight here. Were you trying to get away or not? Of course I was. But you're in the car, you're drinking blood off these other girls' arms. I just don't understand. I wouldn't expect you to. God, has anything like this ever happened to you? Can't say as it has. Well, it's not exactly easy to tell a car full of vampires that you're just walking away. I was scared. I was-- I was scared of what they would do to me. Drink. The three of us need strength. I can't wait to have your baby. Rod, I need to talk to you. Can't it wait? It already has long enough. OK. Talk. In private. So what's so important? I just need to know if it's true. Everything's true. No. No, I mean somewhere inside of me, I know it's true. You didn't do the things you said you did. And my parents are still alive. I assure you-- Rod, I know how you like to talk, all right? And I understand that. I'm mad. I just-- please tell me it's not true. Do you know how many souls one must consume to open the gates of hell? It's a number far greater than you can count. Rod. Would you deny me entrance to the gates of hell? I just need to know. Wake up. Help me get his wallet, all right? Hmm. Who are you? What do you want? Shut the fuck up, lady. Shit. You fucking bitch. Get away from me. Please. You taste just like your daughter. Go to hell! I intend to. I beat your father's head in with a crowbar. The one that's in the car. And your fucking bitch of a mother threw coffee on me, so I bashed her head in too. That's it. Help me! Get off of me! Hey. You'll get through it. Be strong. It's OK. It's OK. I don't know what to tell you, man. I snapped and I liked it. You know, to tell you the truth, I felt a lot better when it was all over. All right. It's time to make yourself useful again. Hey, go upstairs. Find some money. Scott. Don't forget my jacket. It's a shame, don't you think? I don't know. We've left our mark without leaving our mark, you know? What do you mean? Rod. We should get out here. Yeah? And you left? We left. At this point, both Ruth and Rick Wendorf were already dead, is that right? Are you not listening to what I just said? Did you not just hear me, huh? Yes. I beat their faces in, all right? I murdered them. I'm admitting to murder. God. Rod, there's just one thing that I'm not real clear on right now. Listen to me. Look. Will you look at me? You went there to steal a car. That is all. Why so much bloodshed? I don't know. Get up. Get up. I don't remember much of what happened after that. I was in a daze. Mom? It's Dana. I don't know if you've heard-- you have heard. CNN? Yeah. We're-- we're in-- we're in big trouble here. We're running out of money. Mom, I need you to wire me some money in Louisiana, OK? Where, exactly? Howard Johnson's. Yeah. Yeah. I'll give you the number. It's, uh, 555-9847. OK. Thanks, mom. I knew I could trust you. So what's up? She's sending the money. Hey, Bill, we got them. That's great news. How much is she sending? I don't know. You didn't ask. Just be glad we're getting something, OK? Maybe we can eat some real food. Hey, come here. Heather, come here. All right. Tonight, our coven is complete. Our journey is complete. Every single roadblock has been erased. Do you realize that? Every single one. We are here. We are now. We're forever. We are now family. Hey. I'm expecting a wire to come through. I'm, uh-- I'm Dana Cooper. Where is it coming from? From South Dakota. And the signer's name? Oh, Jodi Remington. Nope. No. We haven't received it yet. So if you have a seat over there with your buddies, we can let you know when it comes through. Thanks. He's going to let us know when it gets here. They tell you how much it is? Don't be stupid. What? How is that stupid? It just is. I'm going to go check on it again. Ask how much it is. Yeah, Mick, we got a UN589. Looking at it right now. Has that wire come through yet? Let me check. What was the name again? Dana Cooper. And the sender's name, please. Jodi Remington. No. But if you have to sit over there with your buddies, I'll be able to help whenever it comes in. You let me know as soon as it gets here. All right. Everybody freeze. Get down on your knees. All right, everybody, don't move. Don't move an inch. Get up. Hands on your head. Put your hands in the air. Officers-- On your knees right now. - Get your hands on your head. - Happy Thanksgiving. - And stop moving. - I was wondering if you guys-- - Stop. - Get down on your knees. Stop moving! Well, you know the rest. Heather, um, we, uh-- I know this has been a long couple of days for you. And we realize that. Here, Heather. I'm so sorry. Are you OK? I'm sorry. Behold, all the eyes shall see them. All the wounds that pierce them. Take pleasure in his sins. Take pleasure in her suffering. When you lie with the beast, you shall die with the beast.
