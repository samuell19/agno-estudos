Come on, I'll show you around. - Is this a Beretta? - Glock, Beretta, same thing. That's standard issue. That's a beautiful weapon. 10-shot clip, five-inch barrel. Some departments are issuing these yellow stun guns now, but that's what most every cop in the state carries. - My dad has this old Remington, an old Kirby rifle. The Kirby doesn't work anymore, though. - Yeah, well if you wanna go into the academy, that's what you have to learn to fire. - I'm thinkin' about it. - Why do you wanna be a cop? - So I can have one of these. - You'll be a skinny cop. I was a skinny cop, too. Six months in the academy, you'll have one of those. Right? - What? - Don't you think he'd be a skinny cop? - Too skinny. Why you talkin' about guns? - Always, always butt first. Got that? - Yeah. Sorry. - How much is it gonna cost? - $300. - Oh, why so much? - The heater. The main engine belt's busted, I have to fix the belts. - I don't know. - Mom, it's just $300. - If you want the money for something practical, then that's different. - What about Randall? He said he can get me into the academy, is he serious or what? - You're not gonna go into the academy. - Why not? He shouldn't keep that gun loaded in the garage. - It's not loaded. - Yes it was. And he says I'm gonna be a skinny cop. I'm not that skinny. - Can you be nice? What about your girlfriend? - I don't have a girlfriend. - That girl, Lauren. - Aw, Lauren broke up with me.

He doesn't like me that much, you could ask him. - I'm going to bed. Monster fell asleep. - Okay, good night, I love you. - Want a kiss, too? - I'm fine. - Okay, okay. - See, he likes you. - Wait, what are you doing, what are you doing back here? PJ, where's your tie? - I lost it. My shirt's too small. - Okay, you're gonna get fired. - You're gonna get fired. - No, I'm not gonna get fired, 'cause Ralph likes me. - Ralph likes you. - Yeah, so you really need to start wearing your tie. - You having a good day? - I'm fine, PJ, will you please now clear four and seven, please, thank you. - Are you gonna come over later? - I can't do this right now.

It's disgusting, you should really do something about this. - You wanna be my maid? - What, you think all Hispanic girls wanna be maids? No, I don't wanna be your maid. - All Hispanic girls are maids. - I don't wanna be a maid. - What do you wanna be? - I don't know. Maybe a teacher, I know some sign language. - I know sign language. - Yeah, what do you know? Not the bad stuff. - That's all I know, that's the good stuff. - Were you arrested? - What? - I don't know, Ralph said that you were arrested. - Yeah, I spent one night in jail. So what? - Nothing. - Ralph talks shit. He talks shit about me all the time. I still want you to clean my house. Naked. Bank called. I got 10 days to leave the house. Now all this legal shit. - Legal shit? - Court order for eviction. - Ah shit. That son of a bitch, Mel, he told me he wasn't gonna dump this on me when I was in here. - It's not workin' with me, Dad, I don't have any money. - Are you gonna call Ben? You call up Ben, you tell him you need a car, go to work at the mill. - I don't wanna work at the mill. - Oh PJ, why. Washin' dishes ain't gonna cut it. It's not gonna happen that way. I'd call Ben, but he doesn't wanna talk to me, he just. Hangs up on me. - If Ben doesn't wanna help me, where do I go? - You go to Mom. - I can't. Randall's got a kid, there's no place to sleep. - Uncle Vic. You remember Uncle Vic, my brother?

What's the matter with you? Change the belts on the truck? - Yeah I changed everything. All the plugs and shit. What's going on? - It's company policy, and you're not in uniform. Plus you were late again. - You need to hire another guy back there. I'm doing the work of two people. - Look, she's in uniform. Should she take off her tie and give it to you because everyone is sick of our attitude. - You're lookin' for something to complain about. Maybe if you shut your fuckin' mouth and let me do my god damned job you wouldn't have a problem. - Ralph, no. - What's going on, what'd you say? No, no, no, don't you fuckin' put your hand on her. - Stop this - Who do you think you are? - You're fired! - PJ!

You need a job? - Yeah. - The only guy I know who does a lot of insurance work, fire job, the sloppy shit. Contractor I know gets work from the insurance companies. They have these homes that burn down because the electrical's so damn old, and all the wiring is corroded. That sound like good work to you? You know, I didn't find out your dad was arrested until I read about it in the paper. You believe that? My own brother. Had that terrible photo of that little smashed up Plymouth. Then the truck just loses a little paneling and a headlight. Your dad put a lot of money into that truck. He loved it. - What'd my dad tell you about it? - Nothin'. First time he called me, it was about you. So what about you? - When my dad got arrested, my mom ran off with a cop. So what the fuck am I supposed to do? - You wanna be smart ass, we can forget the whole deal. Drop the attitude, okay? We're here to figure things out. - Right. Listen, you didn't tell me about the job yet. What does it pay, 'cause I don't work for anything under $10 an hour. - Have you ever heard the expression, don't look a gift horse in the mouth? - Okay. - I'm offering you an opportunity, I'm not some bar slut you fuck and forget, okay? You can't run me over, I guarantee you that. I don't have to help you. You're in a tough spot, I'd be a little pissed, too, but you have to know when to shut up. So, what do you wanna know about me? - Why do you have all those tattoos? - I was young. Almost as cocky as you. That's my joke. I know you're smart, kid. Joined the corps in '68. - You fought in Vietnam? - The jungle, yep. - What about that arm? Whose initials, MB? - Old girlfriend. When I was young, that was the cool thing to do, deface your body when you got a piece of ass. - Who was she? - Marianne. Bishop. Marianne Bishop. - My mom was your old girlfriend? She was your piece of ass. - Not girlfriend, just a friend. I introduced her to Carl. - When? - Long time ago, I met her when she was in nursing school. I was a teacher's assistant at a junior college. - You were a teacher? - Let me finish, I was a teacher's assistant at a junior college, right down the street. She drove a yellow VW Bug. I'd see her around, and we dated. I introduced her to Carl, he was only 20 years old. He told me I was too old for her. They were the same age, I was too old. He was a kid, they were kids. I went to Vietnam, and they got married, and Corporal Peterson, my best friend at my platoon gave me this tattoo. I was jealous. But it doesn't matter now, does it? Your dad had a family, and he threw it away. - I never heard that before. - He wouldn't tell you that. And your mom sure as hell won't tell you that. - How do I know you're not full of shit? - I'm too fuckin' old to lie about something like that. You don't have to believe a word I say. - How come you never got married? - When I came back from the war, I was untouchable. Everybody else was in a wheelchair or crazy, walkin' around in circles talkin' to themselves, but I was fine. Did a lot of drinkin', did a lot of drugs. After after a few years, joined the carpenter's union. 28 years there, now I'm retired with two pensions. I had girlfriends, just. Didn't get married. - That's how you know all those construction guys. - That's right. If you're honest with me, like I'm honest with you, maybe we can work somethin' out. - Okay. - So who's this girl who called your house when I was over there? - Just a girl from work. She has a cute face, good values. She's got a big ass though. - A big ass won't hurt you, PJ. It's an honest answer. That's what I mean. You need a place to stay? You got everything you need? - Yeah. - In the morning after you shower and shit and all that, keep all your stuff, your toothbrush and everything, in one spot, 'cause I like to keep the bathroom super fuckin' clean. - Okay. - All right. - Hey, Vic. Thank you. - Okay. Charlie, it's Victor Lee. I'm fine, thanks, how's work? I see you're doing the new bank over off Milton. Well, my nephew's lookin' for a little work, and thought if you needed a runner or someone to clean up some job sites. Okay. It's my brother's son, I don't have any kids. He's as strong as an ox, I personally vouch for him. He's a good kid. - You have boots? - Well boys, in a few minutes that badass inspector will be here with that stinkin' cigar. - Ain't he that prick that was on that job where Marty got stabbed by that crazy nigger for $11? - Yep, same guy, right up the street from that other fire job we did. - PJ, you know who Marty is we're talkin' about? - No. - You don't wanna get on the wrong side of him. You'll get all this drywall and shit cleaned up before he gets here, 'cause he's a stickler for that safety shit. - All right. - You gotta chop those thinner. And you don't have to swing the ax so hard. - Is this the area where you hunt? - I shot seven deer out here. I used to hunt with Ben. - Did he kill one? - Ben can't shoot worth a shit. I took him out here four days before he got married and tried to teach him a few things. Couldn't hold the rifle steady. I think he was more interested in drinkin' my scotch than he was learnin' how to shoot. He's not very agile. Was too slow. - So when you sell all this wood, how much do you make? - Right now, 25, $30 a bundle. I sell to gas stations and grocery stores. Keeps me busy. - So what about you and Ben? - I give Ben a lot of credit, he works his ass off. Ben's a lot like me. - Ben's wife had a Cesarian section for the baby. And after that, Ben kinda get all fucked up. - How's that? - He cheats on Maria. Lies to everybody. He's fuckin' this bartender. - That's his business. What about you? What about your girl, what about your career? - I don't have a girl. Not yet. - You can waste a lot of time and a lot of money chasin' women. You chase girls, they run away, right? - Yeah, so? - You don't chase, that's the key. You say you don't have a girl, but you do. And this girl with a big ass likes you, right? - She's Mexican, though. - So what? Just don't be a pussy chaser because it's a waste of time. Be smart about the people you invite into your life. - So I can end up like you? Alone? - I'm all I need. Nobody can put up with me, so I can chase all I want. You got that? - Hey. - Hey. - I ordered you an apple pie. - I don't really like apple, I like chocolate. - I know. They checked, they don't have it. - I called your house about two weeks ago. And some old guy picked up the phone. - Vic. - Who is that? - It's my uncle. I got kicked out of my house, now I live with my uncle. I was gonna call you, but with my new job and everything. You look different. - Yeah, I just curled my hair, but I don't really like it. - I like it. - I know why you got kicked out of your house, PJ. - I was gonna-- - Don't say anything, because you had a chance to say it, and you didn't. I know about your dad, and I know about everything. - Who said that? - People at work. Look. I think about you a lot. And I just really hope that sometimes, you think about me, too. - I do think about you. - They got some lawyer for you, about 35, he's a pain in the ass, 'cause he's promising me the moon. I missed you last Tuesday. - Yeah, Uncle Vic got me a job. Hey, you remember a guy named Charlie Haskill? - Charlie Haskill, same Charlie Haskill I played baseball with in high school? - He's my boss. - Well, tell him Merry Christmas. You know I was thinking all morning about Christmas, you guys growin' up. One morning, you got up early, and you went downstairs, and you opened all the presents. Mom was upset because she didn't get any pictures. But I got you this bike, and you were riding the bike outside in the snow in your pajamas. It was 10 degrees outside, but you were so god damn excited. You remember that? - Yeah, the training wheels kept getting stuck in the snow. - Yeah. Well, this thing's gonna cut out on me, PJ, so I'm gonna say Merry Christmas, you know, Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year. To you and to everybody. - Yeah. - Hello, Carl? - That you, Vic? - Hang in there. - You keep my boy straight, okay? - Straight as an arrow, bye Carl. - Dear Lord, we thank you for this food, and for this opportunity to share it with one another. We ask that you look over those who are no longer with us and others who cannot be here with us tonight. All these things, we ask in your name. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Let's eat. - What are you doing? - Open it. - I didn't get you anything. - Just open it. - Is this, uh. Is this your way of telling me I'm sorry that I'm a lighter-stealing. - I didn't steal your lighter. You lost it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Yeah, well I'll take you down to the station house, you'll sign some paperwork, meet Chief Kessner, and I'll take you down to junkie town. - Saturday or Sunday? - Whatever day you want. - So I'm gonna be in the car the whole shift? - Yep, 10 hours. We'll ride all over town, I'll walk you through everything. You serious, right? - Serious about what? - I'm takin' PJ on a ride along this weekend. Where's the soap for the dishwasher? - I'm serious. - Is that the girl from work? - Yeah. - She's really cute, really nice. - Is she okay? - So why didn't you tell me you got fired from work? - I didn't get fired, I quit. Plus I got job with Uncle Vic. - PJ. Dress warm this weekend. - So you did have a good time? - I did. - Was I okay? - I wouldn't lie. - The chocolate cake was good? - The chocolate cake was good. - You weren't just making a face to make it look like it was good? It was actually tasty? - I'm not a good actress. - 'Cause she did make it just for you. - That's very nice of her. Your family's really cool, I had such a good time. - Thank you for coming. What did I tell you about speaking Spanish in here? This is an English-speaking truck. - Oh gosh. - You see eight Mexicans in the back with a snowblower? - No, if they were there, they wouldn't have a snowblower because it doesn't snow in Mexico. - Oh. - Bad joke, bad joke. You really need to learn some Spanish. - I know, I don't have anyone to each me. - Ugh! I can teach you. - Okay. - Okay. - Teach me some Spanish. Don't make fun of me. What does that mean? - Si or yes? - Si. - Si. - What does that mean? - I asked if I was your girlfriend. - You tricked me. - I did, and you can't take it back, so there. - I don't wanna take it back. - Yeah? Good. I gotta go. - No you don't. - Yeah, I gotta go. - You can stay here and sleep. - No. - You can sleep with me and Uncle Vic. - I'd love to. - I don't want you to go. - I don't wanna go. - Ben? - Jenny's sleeping? - Yes. Where were you, Ben? - I, uh, was at my mom's. She says hi. - I talked to your mom, Ben. Do you know a girl named Lucy Jones? From high school? - No. No, who's that? - Ben, don't lie to me. - Forget it. Go to bed. - No, I'm not gonna go back to bed. - Shh! - I've been laying in bed all night waiting for you. So what happened? Is something going on? - Who did you talk to? - I've been so patient with you. Are you fucking her? - No. No. - We are barely making it, here. Look at us. Look at where we live. It's Christmas. Do you realize that? You think I'm stupid, don't you? - No. - But you-- - Shh, I don't think you're stupid. I don't think you're stupid. - You have lied to me over and over and over again. Keep your hands off me. - Just stop, come on. - I fuckin' hate you. Fuckin' hate you. - Shh, stop. - Can you page him, please? Ben Lee, I'm his wife. I'm leaving and I'm taking Jenny to my mom's. - Do you want anything else outta the kitchen? - Yeah, just get the baby stuff. - Sure. - The chair's mine. I just need to know where the key to the deposit box is. Yes, the key! For the bank. - Mom got these gifts for the baby. - You know what, I don't want these. I don't, this is not what I want. - Can you just take 'em? I can't take' em back. - Let's go, the truck's full. - Well, I wanna put the TV in there. - Well, the truck's full, I mean, you're gonna have to sit up front with it. - It's Ben's TV. - I wasn't talkin' to you. Listen, what do you want that TV for? It's note even 13 inches. Why don't you just go out and buy me a new one? - Ben gave me that TV for my birthday. - Okay, then we'll take the TV. Geez. Thanks for helpin' me move, brother. - Look, I'm sorry, okay, but it's true. - Hi. - Where's Ben? - Met a girl. - Where is he? - I have no idea. Ben doesn't talk to me anymore. Maybe you should ask his new girlfriend. - I thought that was you. - What? - I thought you were his girlfriend. - No, I'm not. I'm not anybody's girlfriend. Come here, follow me. Come around the bar. I love getting high in the winter. Can I ask you a question? - Mm-hm. - Is it true about what your dad did? - What did my dad do? - Ben said he's in jail 'cause he killed somebody. - An accident. - Yeah, but she's dead, dude. I'm sorry. Just a little high. I am. I am sorry about Ben and his wife and all that. - It's not your fault. It's his. - You remind me of Ben. When he was nice. - I'm not nice. - Yeah, you are. And you're so fuckin' cute. Do you think I'm cute? - No. - Can I kiss your cheek? Yeah? Mm. - You know, sometimes you can ride around the whole fuckin' day and nothin' happens. I gotta be honest with you. Sometimes it's hard to feel like a cop. Yeah, you wanna be involved and everything, makin' things right and helping people, but half the time, what do I do? Chase some broke down station wagon that was stolen two months ago? Spend the whole day runnin' plates. Tryin' to referee people's problems, can't take care of their self? Nobody tells the truth. Everybody lies. For what? So you can call yourself a police officer. Put on a uniform every day? When my first wife died, I was bad news, boy. Bad news. Two kids, couldn't even sleep in my own bed after that. I had to move, get out. Drama. Your mama was so nice to her when she was in the hospital. So nice. So you learnin' anything today? - How old do you have to be to be in the academy? - I told you, you're old enough. Just need a sponsor. Get a department to sponsor you, you in. Your head on straight? You clean? No felonies? - I'm clean. All right, then. - Unit 12? - Go for Unit 12. - Code 3215, Seventh and Naldy. - 1076, I'm on the way. Here we go. - Ready code black. - Hold on to him, hold on! Get him up. What happened? - I took the domestic call and he came out with a gun. - I didn't do shit. - You shut up. She says he threatened him. - All right, you talk to her. - The fuck are you talkin' about? - Shut up! - You fuckin' piece of shit! - I didn't do shit to you! Fuck, fuck! You a fucking cop? - No, I'm not a cop. - Who is it? - It's me. - Me, who? - Ben, it's me, PJ. - You got my TV? - This is from Mom. Where you been, Ben? - It's a canary. Jenny saw it in the pet store, so I got it for her. His name's Sebastian. - It's a parakeet. - You owe me a TV. - No I don't. - Yes, you do. You were here when she took it, you didn't do anything to stop her. You owe me a TV. Besides, you're workin'. - Yeah, Uncle Vic got me a job working construction. - So you're workin' now, good job, steady income. You still dating that fat Spanish girl? - Amy. - The fat one. - She's not that fat, man. - But she's got like 15 pounds on you. Does she have big tits or small tits? - They're good. - Yeah, it's kinda like the trade off. If you're gonna fuck a fat girl, she's gotta have these big bombs, you know what I'm saying? I've fucked some fat girls in my time, man. Fat white girls, fat black girls, fat Asian girls. I've never fucked a fat Spanish girl, though. What's the matter? - 50 bucks. - Randall. Mom and Dad never did shit like this. Only fuckin' thing I can remember Dad doing is when he used to get us up early in the morning to go shovel the driveway after it snowed. Remember that? - Yeah. - You and I'd sit there fighting over the one pair of boots that we had. Sat there fighting in the snow. I used to kick your little ass. - You were a lot bigger than me. A lot stronger, too. - Who do you think would win now? - You. - I don't now. I don't know. You're a tough little shit. You know, you and I are a lot alike. - No, not really? - No? What about Lucy? She's hot, right? See, there's something we have in common. We like the same pussy. You fuck her? - No. - Did you tell Maria about her and I? - No. - Either you fucked Lucy, or you told Maria that I did, so which is it? - You're being paranoid. - No, I'm not being paranoid. You're a little liar. - All I know is I was at Ma's party, Maria called, and you weren't there. I got the card and the gift, I came over here, and that's it. - So you fucked Lucy. Right? You were at the bar the other night, weren't you? - Yeah. - Peej, I don't care. Why do you feel you have to lie to me? You tell Dad your lies when you go see him? - What does Dad have to do with this? - Does he ask about me? - Yeah, he says Merry Christmas. - He says what? - He told me to tell you Merry Christmas. - The only fuckin' thing I remember about Christmas with Dad, is when Mom tried to leave with us, and she's screamin' and cryin'. He trapped Mom in the bathroom. - He never did that. - Yes, he did. You were too young to remember. He did it then and a lot of other times, but don't you remember Mom in the bathroom screamin' and cryin'? He's fuckin' nuts. - You know how long Dad's gonna get if he's found guilty? - He is guilty. - Seven years. - Well, that's seven years of collect calls I'm not gonna accept. I got fuckin' child support and alimony, whatever the fuck it is. I gotta hire my own god damn attorney now. - Well it's your fault, Ben. That's why you're so fucked up. 'Cause you blame everyone but yourself. - Well at least I'm not a fuckin' little liar. So which is it? Because it wouldn't surprise me if you fucked Lucy and told Maria, so which is it? - Neither, you paranoid fuck. - What do you want me to do? Do you want me to kick your ass? - Yeah, that's why I came over here, Ben. I want you to kick my ass. - This little shit. - That's a nice bird over there. And it sucks that there's no one here to appreciate it. Where's your kid, Ben? - What are you gonna fuckin' leave now? - Yeah, just like you, remember? So fuck you! Fuck Lucy, fuck your fat fuckin' wife! And her scar on her fuckin' stomach. - Oh really, huh? You fuckin' liar! Say it, say it! - Seat right here. - You think I could be alone with my son this time? - Sure, just for a minute. - Thanks. What the hell happened to you? - It's from Ben. We got into a fight. - He cracked you pretty good, did you fight back? - Yeah. He got into a fight with Maria, and he thought it was because of me. And he went crazy. - What happened then? - Nothin'. I don't tell him anything, Dad. - What? What do you mean, what didn't you tell him? - I'm gonna turn myself in. I'm gonna tell 'em it was an accident. - Wait a minute PJ, what are you talkin' about? - I should've turned myself in, all this shit's happened. I got no where to go, I got nothin' to do. I got no one to talk to. - Listen to me, PJ, okay, just listen to me, all righT? Don't talk to anybody, just listen. All right? I mean, it doesn't make any difference if it was an accident or not. I mean, it wasn't an accident, but that doesn't mean anything. I mean, this woman, she's dead, and we're sorry, and someone has to take responsibility. I mean, believe me, they don't care who. They don't care who takes the blame, they just wanna have somebody to pay. And you come in here now, this would destroy you-- - Well, they're gonna find out, Dad, they're gonna find out what I did. - No they're not, they're not gonna find anything out as long as you keep your mouth shut. You don't say anything. That's all you gotta do is live your life, forget about this, stay outta trouble, you promised me that you'd stay outta trouble. That's it. - But you're not guilty. - Yeah, well. You and I both know that things were never good. I left, I left my family, I left my kids, turned my back on you guys. You grew up, I don't know how, I wasn't there. Right, I missed all those years of you playin' soccer, Ben playin' football. I left you guys. So, and then when I wanted to come back, it was too late. Maybe I owe you a little bit, eh? Maybe I got a little bit of guilt. I don't know what else to tell you, PJ, except that I don't want you to be like me. Don't be like me. Don't do what I did. Don't do it. You let me do this, okay? I owe you. You just promise me, you're gonna stay outta trouble, and you're gonna let me do these years. 'Cause I can do this PJ, I mean it's seven years, that's all it is. All you gotta do is believe this the right way to go, and then forget about it. Believe it in your heart that this is right. Let me do it, and then forget it. I'm your father. Let me do this for you. - How come you're here? How come you're not at work? - I quit. - Turn around. That's why my bathroom's all bloody. You got blood all over my towels, too. - I'll clean it. - Too late, I already did. What happened to your eye? Who'd you get into it with? - Ben. - Speak up. - Ben! - Go put the juice back into the refrigerator. - It's empty. - Remember when we were talking about you being honest with me, that was part of our agreement. - What agreement? You only helped me because my dad asked you to. - You're exactly right, but it's a two-way street here. Charlie Haskill did me a favor and you shit all over it, we're family, you and me. And I'm sick of your inability to take some responsibility for things. - I hated that job. - There's something in life called respect, and you earn it, but you don't seem to know that. - Sorry about the job, Vic. What do you want me to say? - You're not sorry. You didn't come to me and tell me anything. I've fed you, I've done your laundry, I've let you save every god damn penny you earn, and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of taking all your calls from that god damned girl. I don't even know her name. - It's none of your fuckin' business. - Why, you expect me to do everything else, you can't tell me about that? She was fine a month ago. What's your excuse now, PJ, because you don't make any sense. And you like this girl, I can tell, but you won't bring her around me. - You think you know something about me because we have the same last name? You don't know shit about me. - I see a scared kid who's become the person he doesn't wanna be. Stop looking down on people, PJ. - I don't look down on people. - Your brother, yes you do! Me! I don't know. - Ben cheated on his wife and she left him. - Okay, so that's why you're so mad? - I'm not mad. - Yes you are. You're mad that your dad's in jail, so what? You're mad that your big brother beat you up, so what? And you're mad that you know I'm right. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to put everything on the god damn line with me right now. Things are fucked up. Pick one to fix, 'cause you can't have it all, trust me. I've had people come and go in my life too. My father was killed in Korea when I was 11 years old. They didn't even send the god damn body back! Just the god damn dog tags! My brother died six months later. I fucked a lot of things up in my life after that. Now you pick one. - I'm gonna leave. - Bullshit. I'm gonna drive into town and put money on the table for your dad. - My dad says he's guilty. - I don't care. - What if I say no? - It's not your decision anymore. - What do you want me to do, Vic? - I don't know. I don't know. I just. I just want things to work out a little bit better between you and me, that's all. - Come on, piece of shit!

Now I've seen you and now it's just me, I'm lonely. - Oh, it's not just you, it's everybody. Things like this don't just go away, Carl. - I understand that, Marianne.
