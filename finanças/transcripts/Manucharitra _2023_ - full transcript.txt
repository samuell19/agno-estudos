Shekar. Shekar. Prabhakar. All these days we have worked together like brothers, how can you even think of killing me? Dawood, at least you tell him to not kill me... Orders are to kill you. - Don't kill me, leave me. We can't... Hey, stop! [Brakes squeal] Brother... Brother... It's my fault, I made a mistake. It's my fault, I made a mistake... spare me this one time. Will move away to Surat or Dubai along with my wife and kids. Won't even face you here after, even if I am dead. Shekar, I would have spared you if you had cheated me, but you betrayed me, being my person, how dare you join hands with Muthireddy and plan to kill Janardhan Kaka. Guys, if ever anyone of you tries to betray me, then you will have to face Rudra's stab. Prabhakar. - Sir. Throw his dead body in Vaddepalli lake, no one should even come to know his whereabouts. Ok sir. [Dog barking] [Phone ringing] [Phone ringing continues] Yes? - Kaka. Shekar is no more. Orugallu village is the fort of Rudrapratap, no one here has enough courage here to touch you, until I am here. Rudra, will meet tomorrow in the event. Ok Kaka. Shekar. [Laughs] Pull him down soon. Make it fast. 'Breaking news.' 'Warangal district, Mayor Janardhan Rao is missing.' Investigation is on, will soon find out the Mayor details. Amid our presence in Orugallu, how dare someone hurts Kaka. Who the hell is he? Where does he live? [Devotional song playing] [Song playing on radio] Ticket, ticket. Hey you, when there is enough space inside, why are you hanging out? Didn't you read what's written here? When we don't even read our class notes, why will we read this? As per the rule, foot boarding is an offence. We just break the rules. - Take care, you might fall down. He has come again. These boys have become idiots. How dare you try to flirt with my sister. - Sister? Goddam person. How dare you tease girls. Brother, enough. If ever again you follow my sister or if I see you near the college surroundings, then I will rip you off. I will take care of him, you leave. Let's go. Start the vehicle. [Engine starts] [Coughs] [Groans] Vodka full. Brother, give me a beer. - Ok. [Bottle smashed] Shravya! Shravya! Shravya! Shravya! Shravya! Shravya! Shravya! Shravya! - Who are you? What's this nuisance in the campus? - Get lost. Shravya! He is here again. Shravya! Sir, there is a drunkard at the gate and is creating lot of nuisance. Shall we lodge a complaint? - You stay away, I will handle it. He seems to be a thug, it's better to call the police. Is name is Manu, was once the College topper, and my favourite student too, nothing to worry. Shravya. Just because your brother hit me doesn't mean that I will forget you. I am ready to get hit by your brother number of times, your brother can kill me, but not the love which I have for you. My love won't die that easily. Moreover death is for people, not for their love. I know that you too love me. The reason is your eyes, I can find the same love in them which I had for you when I saw you for the first time. Don't hide them. You may hide your feelings but your eyes cannot. I love you, Shravya. "Are you the arrow which has hit the girls heart" He will never change. "Love starts when lips start smiling..." [Music] "Did your eyes like me and your heart felt me?" "Did my love cross your path?" "Hold onto my hands and listen to my words" "from here on we are Radhe Shyam..." "Come on my love." "Come on my love, let's stay together..." "Come on my love..." "Come on my love..." Manu. Hey stupid! Can't you see? Sorry ma'am, sorry sir. You don't even have sense. Are you okay? - Hmm. Did it hurt you? - Uh hmm. Manu. - Hmm? I have told my brother about our relation. What did you say? Told him that, I like Manu, we both are in love. And I would like to marry him, is it ok for you? Why are you so tensed? My brother won't harm you. He is not a beast like you think, he likes me a lot, I will make him understand. Don't get tensed. Is it tension my dear. I know how to relax you. Shravya, what is this? This is...kiss..on cheeks... What? What's wrong in this my dear? We are anyways going to get married. Did I tell you that I will marry you? Manu, what happened? Did I tell that I will marry you? But you said that you love me, how come you are speaking like this now. This won't workout for me. Breakup. Manu, are you joking. I am not joking, we are not in sync, we have lot many differences in our thought process, I am not the right person for you. Breakup. Manu, what are you saying? Manu, what the hell, why are you walking away? Manu. "Even Ramanujan cannot divide a number by zero..." Appreciate your work mister, take your salary. I am quitting this job sir. - Isn't this salary enough? I didn't like the work brother. "He is just like a puzzle which has no answers" "And which has taken human form" "Come on my love..." Stop. "Let's stay together" What? Its time, let's go soon. Naveena. - What? All the best. - Ok. "Come on my love..." "Did your eyes like me and your heart felt me?" [Audience applauding] Congratulation. Thank you sir Manu, did you see? - Congrats Naveena. Thank you. - Breakup. Breakup? This looks nice. Yes. Wow Manu, thank you so much. I love you. Breakup. Priya...Priya... Who the hell are you? Is this a joke? I love you Priya. Me? "Where does such a different mind belongs to?" Let's leave all this and start a fresh life. "Come on my love." Priya... I am not the right person to you. Let's breakup. Breakup? Manu! Manu! Breakup.. Breakup... Breakup... Oh my heavenly lord, I have committed a sin, and am very much aware of its punishment. [Phone vibrating] Where are you? - What's the matter? Why don't you answer mom's call? I am going to Sunil place, to pay the monthly scheme amount, he asked me to get you also. Let me know where are you, will come and pick you up. I am in the church... - I am coming. 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22. What's up Nandu? - Yes bro... Is everything fine? - Yes. Good that you got settled with this Internet cafe and paying your monthly interests promptly. I am unable to settle this guy, no matter which job I place him, he works delicately until he gets paid and later quits and on top of it. I get scolded for placing him in the job. I can't handle him anymore and more over my reputation is at stake because of him. The reason why he quit is he didn't find the job satisfaction bro. Even you know that he won't do any work if he doesn't like it. See if you can find a job for him at sir place, he might work there with due respect and fear on sir. Just look at him, we are so much worried about him, and he doesn't even give a heed to us. Will such a person do the job? Please brother. Let's see, take this. What does he think this is, buttermilk or toddy? This is the last time, don't come to me here after with his issues. Please, don't beat me. - Ok brother. Greetings brother. - Greetings. I don't need that land, it's all yours, take it. Just take care while beating, make sure you won't kill him in front of a police officer. Everyone in Warangal is aware of your several illegal business which include, granite mining, land grabbing, liquor, rowdism, with Mayor Janardhan, even though people know this, until now there hasn't been a single proof against you. Sir, this is a bit urgent. Sekhar, the only person who turned approver is missing. Muthireddy might have done something to Shekar. It's Muthireddy who filed a missing complaint. Are you trying to blame me? Shekar is one among us, indeed I should be the one to file a complaint. That's not my intention. - Look Inspector, just by relying on some unknown sources, if you try to blame me then it won't be good for you and your job. You can go now. - Sir. Just get lost. Get up! Drink buttermilk and go. [Snaps finger] If this repeats again, even Muthireddy will go missing, and don't come to me for proof. Mr. Inspector, don't always focus on pending files, at times also focus on knowing more about trending people like me, it will benefit you. You are yet to face the right cop. At any cost we need to get that land. - Sir, he is our person, came here to seek a job. Job? - What is your name? Brother! - [Gunshot] Catch him. Catch him. Don't leave him. Prabhakar, start the vehicle. - He got away. Come on start. - Ok. Go, go, go. Sir. By the way, who are you? He is one among us sir, came here in search of a job. Why somewhere else, ask him to work here itself. Ok sir, greet him. - Even we need people like him. I won't work for you, I don't do rowdism. How dare you say that? Let's go to Kaka place. Is this how you speak to sir? I am what I am say, I won't do rowdism... - What the hell are you saying? I already told you what sort of a fool he is. [Brakes squeal] No worries. Greetings, sir. Rudra. May you live a hundred years. I was just speaking to the party people and here you are. Sir, Muthireddy people have attacked on him. When he decided to kill you in your house, then it seems as though your enemy is observing your movements, just like a CCTV, on a safer note, be careful for few days. It's not me who should be on the safer side, its him, I will go and kill him. Came to say you a word and... - Rudra! Elections are round the corner, in about 6 to 7 months, everything will get screwed up if you do anything silly. Listen to me and stay silent for few days. Will let you the right time with a right plan... Hey. Pilam. - Sir. Will meet once I am back from Hyderabad... Our people could find answers to each and every question on this planet, no one could ever find out the answers for why, what and when a person will fall in love. So true it is, some say that the invention of fire took millions of years to reach from Africa to Asia, but for love to reach a person from one heart to another it hardly takes an iota of a second. Even I don't know why and how popular my blog on love has become, but what gives me immense happiness is the fact that you are in my life because of that blog. Oh my god, it's unbelievable that you have come from such a long distance for me. I am so happy, very happy. This is a great day in my Life, thank you Manu, thank you so much for coming into my life. I am very happy, wish this happiness stays with me forever. It will stay, I know. But... I don't have life. What happened Ayesha? Leave it Manu, I am happy. I am very happy. Tell me what happened? Just tell me. I have brain tumour Manu. Anything might happen at any moment. I don't even know how long will I survive. Treatment cost is 25 lakhs it seems. My father doesn't have that much money, also I never felt sad that I am going to die, but I am scared of it only after you entered in my life. I want to live Manu. I want to live a hundred years with you. What? 25 lakhs? Do you guys have an idea about what you are speaking, have you gone crazy? What do you guys have and why will someone lend you such huge amount? Brother, no matter what, I shall return your money at any cost. I need to save Ayesha. Still have the image of her eyes requesting me to help and save her. Please brother, help me. I can understand your problem Manu, but 25 lakhs is out of my league, the max I can arrange is 2 or 3 lakhs. I will give the assurance bro, somehow adjust the money. To get that amount even I have to go and rob a bank now. Won't you give bro...? - I don't have that much money. Hey. Hey. Where are you going? Will save my Ayesha even if I have to get that money by robbing a bank. Has he gone nuts? No one wants to listen these days. Wait. Meet me in the morning. You need 25 lakhs. Sir, he is not a faithful person. He broke up with my sister. Prabhakar, when you feel he is not a worthy guy, do you think he is apt for your sister? These days breakup has become a common word, just like the anchors on TV announcing break, leave it. He saved my life, he is like my brother now. It's like scolding me if you say anything to him. Ok, I will give the required amount. But what will you do? Will do whatever you say. You should work under me, will you? I will. You have to do rowdism, will you? [Ayesha] 'I want to live Manu, 'want to live with you happily for 100 years...' Will you do? Will you do? - I will. Seshu. - Sir. Take this. Giving it with lot of trust. - Thanks sir. [Machine beeping] God, please. My Ayesha has to survive at any cost. Kindly bless her with life. Please God. Ok Sridhar we will catch up. Call me if you need anything. - Ok sir. Thank you. Sridhar bro. Nothing will happen to her right, she is going to survive, isn't she? she will get cured right...tell me. Just leave it. Why are you talking like this? If this money is not sufficient, then I'll get how much ever money is required. Just make sure she lives. If it's not possible, then I will figure out a different hospital. She doesn't have any tumour to die. Is it!! [Laughs] Guys, Ayesha is going to live. Manu. I lied to know how much love you have for me, but, you love me so much. Do I look like a mad guy to you, the moment I got to know about your tumor, I was so scared and went all around to arrange money for your treatment. How could you cheat me? What made you do this? Is it for money. This money? Take it. [Clapping] Wow. Hello, the most serious and sincere lover. If this is cheating, then what is it that you are doing? How does it feels like playing with the emotions of girls in the name of love, have planned this just to make you realise how it feels when someone plays with our emotions. Are you even a human? Why are you walking away? Don't you have the guts to face reality? I should actually scold your parents for giving birth to a jerk like you. Don't scold without knowing him completely. What else should I know? Isn't he cheating girls in the name of love, moreover what do you know about him. Only I know about him, I am his best friend. And I am the one responsible for what he is today. I am the one who ruined his life. It's me. Do you know how Manu used to be. "Did my breathe take a pause" "Did she stop by breathe with her sight" "Did a new goddess forgot her path" "My heart beat had a reverb" "Did my life just stopped and got converted into one single second" Hello yellow chudidar. It's a goddess temple... I am a Christian. Then how come you are here... Jesus is not against other religion, even then, religion is just for humans, not God. Hello, what's your name? Hey you! Jessica, Julie, Jacquelin. Jennifer? Jennie. Until this moment you are the only beautiful girl whom I have seen. Its pop singer Jennifer Lopez. Hello Ms yellow chudidar. Just tell me if I guessed your name right. Buddy, I am just thinking of Jennie. I doubt if you wrote the exams well, at least write the ICET properly, or else this year also gets wasted. I will do it. Dude, I know how hard you prepared for the exam, don't think of anything else, whoever gives his best in the next 3 hours of exam is going to top the rank, will break your jaws if you think of that girl again... This is not a movie where I can see her time and again, who knows where she is writing the exam? Who knows, even her center might be the same as yours... "Did my breathe take a pause" "Did she stop by breathe with her sight" "Did a new goddess forgot her path" "My heart beat had a reverb" Manu... Bro, its Jennifer... All the best... - Thank you. Bye, bro. - Bye. Nandu, you really have marks on your tongue, thanks buddy... Marks on my tongue? Hey. Hey. Hello yellow chudidar, Jennifer. Did you recognize me from REC college, temple... I did guess your name, Jennifer. - I don't know. Sir, done... It's not about you being done, there is a time limit too. Need to go urgently sir. Even if it's an emergency, I cannot send you. Sir, please. - Sit down. Enough of what you wrote. Just give me the paper and leave. - Thank you sir. Really? All answer wrote. Hello yellow chudidar. How can you think that I will speak when my brother is around. The thing is... What is it, I need to go. How was your exam? Had to write because I paid the fees of it. I already have a seat in Calicut NIT. I am the topper of my college. How did your exam go...? - Was ok. Don't worry, don't feel bad. You will get a seat in some local college. Not everyone can get a seat like me in NIT. See you then, bye. When we met for the first time in entrance exam, it must be accidental, but now when we met here for the second time. Then...so what if we meet again? God must be trying to build a long lasting magical relation between us. Will think about it when we meet again. When will that next time be, I haven't applied for any other entrance exams. Even I haven't. Can I have your phone number. - I don't have one. At least tell me your address. You were telling about god, magic, so will give you a clue, I stay in the lane of lord Vinayaka temple... This one clue is enough. Every temple will have lord Vinayaka. Every street in this city has a temple, which lane and temple will you lookout for! There are people who have crossed seven oceans for their love, will filter the streets and find out jennies house. "Where does she live? Which place she might be in?" "Which lane is her house, what street it must be?" "Whom should we ask her address and which path should we walk?" "When shall we get to know her place and when will his heart feel happy?" [Music] "Let's filter the whole Orugallu area." "Let's round up the whole area of Khajipet." "Let's search each and every bit of Hanumakonda." "Let's find out where the beauty lives." "Jennie is my life, Jennie is my world" "and let this journey's aim be to know about Jennie." [Music] "Does the girl who stole my heart stay in Mandibazar?" "The girl who changed my life, does she belong to Battalabazar area?" "Or the cute little angle of lord Brahma lives in Brahmanavaada?" "Is it Nakkalagutta where she resides, who is making me go crazy!" "Oh my lord of 1000 pillars temple" "Kindly show us the house of that girl which is a temple for me" "Where does she live? Which place she might be in?" "Which lane is her house, what street it must be?" Usually we like girls by our eye-sight, how come my heart liked Jennie? Hey Nandu, this Manu has fallen in love. Sit properly... You will fall down. [Music] "Does this goddess of love live in Pocham Maidan area.." "Is it Raganna Darwaaza street where the Princesses walks around." "Is the girl with glowing beauty living in Mulugu road." "Is she in Vaddepally whose glamour is growing with compound interest..." "Goddess Bhadrakali kindly show me her place," "will name our baby after you" "Where does she live? Which place she might be in?" "Which lane is her house, what street it must be." "Jennie is my life" "Jennie is my world" "and let this journey's aim be to know about Jennie" [Devotional song] I give up... Already half converted. God, Manu is torturing us in this scorching heat. Help us in getting Jennifer address. Will offer my prayers to you, I swear... [Bell rings] - Finally... [Music] Bonalu festival. Jennie, where are you off to? To watch Bonalu. Okay, be careful. Got to know how big Warangal is only when I searched for you. I love you Jennie. Just because we met three times, how can you say its love. Love means knowing one another. Need to travel together, moreover I don't even know your name, village, also I don't like all these. My brothers have sacrificed a lot for me. I need to study MCA in NIT and then get a job in a MNC and need to take good care of them. So, firstly, you need to know about me, that will happen in our journey, lets meet in Calicut NIT. Bye. My name is Manu Durgaraju, Thorroor is my native place. Have a good stay in Calicut. - Ok...ok... Thanks buddy. - Take this. [Cell phone rings] Jagadish is calling. Tell me. Said she is the topper of Koti women college. Got seat in Calicut NIT. Did she join in some other NIT college. She didn't even qualify. Jagdish, just recheck once again, I did, she joined in Ballikonda Vagdevi College through ICET. Manu... My intuition was right, her words are sharp, not her work... What happened? Will you get down now? Train is moving. Manu. I have changed my journey for the sake of Jennie. Actually, I am the topper of my college. Oh, is it! Do you know something? - What? Lecturers explain the classes looking at me. Wow, great... - Hello yellow chudidar. Madam... - Oh Jesus! What is he doing here? Hello madam, is this the NIT of Calicut. What's this Jennie? - You are really great madam. You just brought Calicut NIT to our Ballikonda. You prayed so many gods, not even one of them helped you. She was just boasting. She wrote the exam just for time pass and got a good rank, that too fancy number 27999 only. Hey you, stop it. We say a hundred things, will everything happen or what? Even you said lets meet in Calicut NIT, as though you got a seat there and sacrificed it for me. Go and sit. - Ok, move aside. Hi. - Hello. Hi, I am Manu Durgaraju. Oh Jesus, I should bear him for three years. ICET state rank holder joined our college. Yes sir. - Interesting. Shall we meet him once? - Sure sir. So, passing is having counter, which can execute- Good morning, sir. - Good morning, sit down. Mr. Manu Durgaraj. Who is Mr. Manu Durgaraj? - Yes sir. What's the reason to join this college inspite of being the Top ranker in ICET. Not just that, you got 16th Rank in NIMCET... The girl whom I love joined this college sir. That's the reason why I joined here. What? You have joined this college just for the sake of your love? Do you know how big a mistake is this? If you finish your MCA from NIT, any MNC will offer you a job with a 6 digit salary, you will have a luxurious life, are you aware? Of course I know sir. MNC job, 6 digit salary, luxury life, but no matter what heights we reach in life, if we don't have the loved one next to us, then there won't be any happiness sir. His is the biggest problem with you guys, you get hold onto a trash called love thinking it as life and spoil your careers. Love is scrap... Sir, you can say anything to me, but don't talk low of my love. Sir, with your permission, we are all computer students, isn't it? Who invented Google? Larry Page and Sergey Brin. - Only one, thank you. What is the name of Devdas lover. - Parvati. We might not know the name of person who invented Google, but everyone knows the name of ANR lover Parvati in the film Devdas, That's the strength and power of love sir. Lord Rama built a bridge for Sita, Shahjahan built Taj Mahal for Mumtaz, I just left a NIT seat... In this world everything is surrounded by love sir, be it a rose worth one rupee to crores of rupees of turnover. The blackboards in class rooms might not have formulas, but all the benches will have love symbols etched on them. Without love there is no life and in fact there is no creation. [Clapping] Silence! You said a lot about love and also told that the girl is here. May I know her name? Tell me. Why are you silent now? Don't you have an answer? He doesn't have the courage to tell his girl's name and was telling us stories about love. Look Manu, love is scrap, you should clear it and remove the thought that it's your life. Sir, I am Jennifer. - What's your love story. Manu loved me... I love you, Manu. Silence! Silence! Silence! "Hey, life is so strange" "At times we are jumping in clouds" "Palms holding stars" "Words filled with colours" "Feels as though breath is filled with glow" "Just got introduced to the world of love" "This new introduction to joy seems to be like a festival" "Life is so strange" "At times we are jumping in clouds" [Music] "There are many rainbows around us" "Rivers with silver shine flowing like streams" "Taste filled with rainbow of honey" "Filled with golden mines of fragrance" "Sparkles of snowy flowers" "The air filled with beautiful smiles is talking too" "Just got introduced to the world of love" "This new introduction to joy seems to be like a festival" "Life is so strange" [Cell phone rings] Nandu, say something... "It feels like jumping in the clouds" - Sorry. It's okay. Mobile. Jenny. [Music] "Mornings happen if you come across" "Meeting you makes my evening" "Romance blossoms if you hold me" "Its pain if you part away" "Its life if spent with you" "Moments shared are precious" "It's so magical" Do you know, according to our religion, if we exchange rings like these, then it's called as marriage... But these are just the memories of our love. We will only get married if my brother agree to it, even you promised that you will convince them. Promise me that you will convince them Manu. Promise me. Have you gone mad? I have promised hundreds of times until now, how many more times should I promise. Divert this topic now. As shown in movies, after exchanging rings, they kiss each other. So... Oh my lord... Mom, she is Jennie, we both are in love and would like to get married. Brother, I am in love with a classmate, named Manu. Would like to marry him if you agree. What the hell are you talking? Is this what you are doing in college instead of studying. Inspite of knowing the hardships of your brothers, how can you talk about love. Mom, wait. - You handle her. Manu what the hell are you talking, she neither belongs to our community nor our religion, how can you get a Christian and tell that you want to marry her, what will happen to our family prestige? Mom, how can talk about cast, religion in todays generation. If that's bothering you, then irrespective of your wish, I will marry Jennie. Love at this age feels good for the time being but it won't remain for lifelong, think. Manu is a nice person brother. Ok, are you confident that you will be happy if you be with him. Like how I feel happy and secured when I am with you, it's the same feeling when I am with him too. Ok then, uncle is coming from Dubai in a week, so let's call Manu home and discuss. Thanks brother. In another two months you will be done with your exams, isn't it? Yes. Will come and speak to elders then... "Just got introduced to the world of love" "This new introduction to joy seems to be like a festival" "Life is so strange" "As though we are jumping in clouds" [Music] Life is just like a colourful rainbow, right from the day when I saw Jennie, our love, both families agreeing for our marriage, all this seems so happy. Hope there is no evil eye. I am also submitting my project to the principal tomorrow. I'll take care of it. When did you come from Hyderabad? - This morning. What happened? How did you get hurt? - Nothing. Slipped... Then you should have bruises on hands or legs, not here. What happened? Nothing buddy - Sit. Who is he? Who's that? - Leave it. Ok Nandu, bye. - Ok then, bye. Bye. - Bye. Hey, who are you? What made you come in our area? Came here to meet a friend. To flirt with girls? You bugger. Leave it, Manu. It's Gita's brother. Get up. - Leave it, please. Just get up. Come on, let's go. - Let's not fight. Gita will get upset. Umesh come. Will sort out things with them. - Please. This house. Guys stop it. Come out, hey you, come out. Hey! - Who is that? Whom do you want? He is my friend Nandu, he and your daughter love each other. You go inside. How dare you directly come to home when I warned you to not even come into our area, damn it. [Groans] Brother! Call our people, how dare you beat us. Hello...these guys are beating Nandu, come to the fort. Kalyan is being beaten up, come soon. Guys, come soon. - What's this nuisance in our street. Come on guys. Come on guys. Come here. Who entered our fort? - Find them. Don't spare anyone. Find them. Don't spare them. - This way. [Drums beating] Michael give me the rod. You bloody. How dare you beat Nandu! Stop! Stop it! He is my friend, and do you know who am I, Rudra sir friend. He has beaten me in my area, especially this guy. Stop the nonsense. If Rudra sir gets to know this, then no one will go home. So just forget what has happened and go to your respective houses. Move on, come on, go. Go. You also leave from here. - Go away. Go away. So block chain is very very fast and growing in India right now. You know, it is being used for so many factors. Crypto currency and everything. And my project deal with agriculture and block chain. So this is my idea sir. Thank you. Well done, Manu. Your idea is technically very brilliant. With this project both you and our college shall get good recognition. I have seen many people who have spoiled their careers in the name of love, but you proved me wrong. Very soon we will have meetings with corporate companies. Be ready and prepared. - Thank you sir. Hey Jennie, good news, principal has liked our project... [Jennie crying] Manu. [Manu] Jennie. Jennie. - Manu. Why are you crying? What happened? Why are you crying Jennie? Please tell me and where are you? In Samrakshana hospital... Wait, I am coming, and you stop crying. Jennie, what happened? Is it an accident? - No. Then...? My brother... - Where is he? Inside. - Come, let's go. Madam, one minute. - That's the room, Manu. Michael, slowly... Hey you, why are you here? This guy, brother. He is the one who beat me... Hit him... Manu. - Hit him... Is he Manu, did you love this guy? He is a thug, the one who beat Michael. Is it with him that you said will be happy... I didn't beat him wontedly. And I was unaware that he is your brother. Get lost. Get lost. Sir, I didn't hit him on purpose. Jennie at least you tell them. Jennie... 'The customer you are trying to call is unreachable at this moment.' [Cell phone rings] Hello. - Manu, it's me Jennie. Jennie... Where have you been Jennie? Do you how many times I called you in the last couple of days. It was switched off. They took away my phone Manu. Situations at home are not good. Right now I am at the church. - Wait I am coming... Why did you do like that? Why did you do it? I told you many times, how much I love my brothers. Why did you beat my brother? Jennie, I really didn't knew that he was your brother. It was because of Nandu issue... - What's this thing with Nandu? Tell me who is important to you, is it Nandu or me? Of course he is very important to me, and by the way, he is my friend and you are my girl friend. You are just talking like a thug. If this is case, then how do you think my brothers will agree for our marriage? Who are they to accept, we both are majors, come, let's go and get married. I have told you many times, we will only get married if my brothers agree. Even you promised to convince them, and now you are talking something else. The mistake is mine, I should be blamed... [Crying] Don't cry Jennie. I cannot see you cry. Ok, now I have to come and ask for an apology, isn't it? Will do it, for your sake I am ready to fall onto their feet as well. Now they are very angry. Will inform you once things settle down situations are not good at home. They will have doubts if I am out for too long, will go home. Jennie... Jennie... I love you, Manu. I love you so much. I am really scared Manu, don't know what to do. I don't want to leave you and go. You don't worry Jennie, I will convince your brothers, no one can separate us. Don't call me unless I call you, or it will be another issue. Okay.

Manu where are you? - I will call you later, please. Jennifer is getting married in Fatima Nagar church. What the hell are you speaking, did you really see it by yourself? I am at the church. - Coming in 10 minutes. Manu, stop! I said don't go. This is not fair. "Did my breathe stop" "Am I left with agony now" "A fact has now turned into a dream worth one second" "Is my love asking me to leave" "Is my love heading towards a closure" Jennie... Why are you here? Come aside, move on. Jennie. "Is it hurting my life" Mr. Ronson Joseph, are you willing to marry her? Yes father. And Jennifer, you? Jennie. Jennie. Jennie, say it. Jennifer. - Say it. Are you willing to marry? "Am I left with agony now" Jennie. Manu! "A fact has now turned into dream" Jennie. Come back. Close the door.

Jennie has come here right, she didn't get married too, isn't it? You saw her also. Let's go and meet her. Jennie got married and flew to Dubai, even her family got shifted. Just leave it... "All of a sudden" "It feels as though someone has crushed my heart" "All of a sudden" "It feels as though my life got evaporated" "I feel separated from myself" "All of a sudden" "All of a sudden" Hey. Buddy, why do you want her memories when she has left you. It's been 4 months that she got married and you are still living with her memories like a mad person. Forget her or at least try to forget her. "Feels as though an inner fire has been burning me" [Coughs] "Time stopped by and is hitting me hard to death" "My breathe and my wish both have stopped" "My breathe and my wish both have stopped" "All of a sudden" Hello. Why don't you speak when I call, first handover the phone to Jennie. Wrong number, idiot. "It's as though someone has stabbed me and torn away my nerves" "The pain is unbearable" I made a mistake. Forgive me Manu. You tried to kill me only once, but that girl left me to live with lot of pain every day. Just like a dead body with life and a lifeless body which can't be burnt. "I have lost my life" "My life just left me" "Suddenly" "Just all of a sudden" Nandu. What do you want to drink? - I don't need anything. Waiter. Sorry Nandu. Be careful. Don't sleep, I will get food. [Music] "Breathe left me in search of her" "Darkness has surrounded me so that her light won't leave me" "My laughter, my own yourself, has left me now" "Has left me now" "My peace, my life and my friendship has left me" "Feels as though an inner fire has been burning me" "Time stopped by and is hitting me hard to death" "My breathe and my wish both have stopped" I tried a lot to know about Jennie, she even deleted her Facebook account. Shwetha, please. You are the only one who can help me to find out about Jennie, try somehow... If it's only for Jennie, then don't call me hereafter... Please Shwetha... "Suddenly" "Suddenly" "Just all of a sudden" "Suddenly" So, condensation is the process where water vapor becomes liquid. It's the reverse of evaporation. Okay? Take it down. Why don't you look at me? Teacher. - Yes. As I said, vaporization is the opposite of condensation. You got it? Okay, teacher. - Alright. Okay students, that's all for today. You all may leave now. Okay, bye. - Bye, teacher. Bye, teacher. - Bye, teacher. How should I start a conversation with him? Hello, hello. You! Mister, ball. Ball.. Ball.. Why is he like this? What happened? - Hey. Gita prepared your favourite chicken curry today. You are spitting out blood, can't you understand. Doesn't matter to me. Get out. [Line ringing] [Cell phone rings] Nandu, check the phone once. Its right in front of you. Hello. - Hello. It's me Stella. Wrong number. - Hello...please, please. Two minutes, don't disconnect the call. Manu, I like you a lot. And been trying to say this for a very long time, but you always seem to be in alcohol trance. Might have loved Jennie to the core, that's why you are drinking like this. What are you deprived off? You look good, also well educated person. It should be she who must be feeling sad for losing you. They say, one should be fortunate enough to have someone who loves us. I am in love with you Manu. How long will you live in the past by remembering her? At least look at the future for my sake who loves you. Will be waiting for you in the bus stop tomorrow at 10am. If you don't turn up, then it will be the last day for me. I hope you won't repeat the same mistake which Jennie did. Stella? That tuition teacher likes you a lot it seems. Gave your number as she has been asking for a long time. It's been 2 years that Jennie got married. She is leading a happy life with her husband and here you are living like a mad person. How much will you drink? - Am I drinking on purpose? I don't have another way to stop thinking about Jennie. Cigarette gives you a dizzy feel for 5 minutes. Alcohol a few hours. And if you take drugs, then maximum for a day. But the next day will be a regular one. Instead of living this hell of a life, why don't you die by committing suicide. Manu. Only a girl's love has the power to let go off the past feelings related to love. Be it the love of parents, friends etc, so if you have to forget your ex girlfriend love, then you have to fall in love again. Love is the only medicine which heals the pain of love. Stella might be the medicine for Jennie's pain. Love is not something which will make you die everyday. It's something which makes you discover a newer version of yourself everyday. Its better you understand this. [Bottle shatters] [Stella] 'I will be waiting for you in the bus stop tomorrow at 10am.' 'If you don't turn up, then it will be the last day for me.' 'I hope you won't repeat the same mistake which Jennie did.' Jennie. [Crying] Jennie. 'Love is the only medicine which heals the pain of love.' 'Stella might be the medicine for the pain caused by Jennie.' [Music] "Did your eyes liked me and heart felt for me, my love" "Hold onto my hands and listen to my words" "from here on we are Radhe Shyam" "Come on my dear" "Come on my dear, let's go together" "Come on my dear" "Come on my dear" - Will you go to tuition, I will... Manu, my boyfriend. - Hello. "Did your eyes liked me and heart felt for me, my love" You look like a thug with this beard. Won't you forget her. Go and die. All these days I thought of cheating my eyes by imaging you as Jennie, but unable to cheat my heart, I am not the right person for you, lets breakup. I'm sorry. Bye. Manu, what are you saying? [Music] Leave all this and come with me Priya. Hey Priya, come. He will satisfy you, go. Go with him. [Crying] All these days he tried to find Jennie in you, not to cheat you. If he really wanted to cheat you, then he wouldn't have get beaten up by your brother. He wouldn't have arranged all the money only to save you by putting his life at risk. In the current times where boys try to take advantage of girls. Did he at least touch your hand? Did he? He never misbehaved with any girl. All he was trying to do was seeking the love so that he can forget Jennie. He knows that what he is doing is not correct, but what to do, he has no other option. When Jennie left him, he went through unbearable pain, a pain which only god could listen, and something which humans cannot understand. If you still feel that he did mistake, then I seek for an apology on his behalf, forgive me. One minute. Sorry. Bro, Manu is coming. Sir, please check if it's the same amount. Thanks a lot for believing and giving the money when needed the most. Manu won't be coming to work from tomorrow onwards. I am unable to see him like that. Sorry sir. You promised to work here. I just said that he won't work here sir. What do you say? - I will work sir. We paid him back his amount, what else? We need to stick to our words, sir believed us and gave the money, it takes a second to lose faith and love, but to stick with it is very challenging. I will work sir. [Gunshot] [Laughs] Brother. [Gunshot] It's not how you handle it, let me teach you. Got to aim first, then see from here. [Gunshot] [Laughs] Very good Manu. Very good. Guys, just see how he is shooting. - [Gunshot] Kudos Manu, kudos. [Gunshot] Hey. Stop it. Manu. Manu. Manu. I am really sorry. Please. If this repeats again. Even what I did was a mistake. At least stop whatever you are doing now. I couldn't stop it and became like this. Please Manu. Manu history, a person history starts right from his or her birth, but this history of Manu started... [Crying] the moment he saw Jennie. They say death cannot stop love, then can marriage be an obstacle to stop the loved one, please Jennie, comeback and save Manu... Please Jennie. Oh, Allah! We both exchanged our rings right in from of you, here, you were the proof too. Then why did you do like this? Why did you distance her from me? We can forgive if we say our mistakes, even you did a mistake by separating me and Jennie. To whom will you say this... You are not there, it's my fault to believe that you were here all these days... You are not here... You are not here? Janu, come fast. Why did you pray for such a long time, when you didn't even know what to pray for? Is there any particular rule as to how to pray, it's all about conveying the matter. By the way, what's the matter? It won't happen if we say it out. Janu. I love you. Lord might have conveyed it immediately. Hello, since how long have you been following... It's just been five minutes, liked the way she was praying to god, so came and proposed her. What? Say it again? I love you Janu... - Hello, are you a Romeo? How can it be love when you propose just immediately after you have seen. This is just attraction. Love means, we should know each other. Even if I don't know about you, then at least you must be aware of my details, like who am I, what's my background, am I committed or not. Should know them, I don't even know your name. What's your name? Stupid guy... Crazy idiot. [Brakes squeal] Excuse me, Final year CSE classroom? Go straight and take left. Right side, first building. Thank you. - It's okay. Hey Janu... Superb. Hey Janu... - Come on Janu. Hi everyone, my name is Manu Durgaraju. I am here to teach as a guest lecturer today. What? Why is he here? Ok, students. First let's introduce ourselves. Yeah. You? I am Sahitya from Vijayanagaram. First time young lecturer, with a beard look, looking handsome. Okay. Hi sir, I am Kareena from Trivandrum. Excuse me. As per the schedule, this is my hour. Sorry sir, I didn't notice. - Thank you. I haven't seen you before. Which department? Love department. What? I need this classroom for five minutes, get up and go back. Who are you? - Sir, please sit. Don't you understand what I am saying? What should I understand? - Don't you understand what I am saying? What's your problem, you have to finish the class? Which subject? What's the topic? Cloud computing. - Wait. So yeah guys like we discuss the skilling primary refers to the sharing of the load on a server based on the query type. It can be either horizontal or vertical based on the kind of things that are generated in that particular query. Sir, hope your duty is finished. Now it's my turn, only 5 minutes. Janu, to introduce yourself is routine. For a change, let me introduce you. Your full name is Janani Patel, father name is Sham Patel, mother name is Shobha Patel, you also have an elder brother named Karthik. David is your friend. People assume you both to be lovers, but he is your best friend. Your father gifted you a crystal doll when you were child. You like it very much. And one day when it fell and broke. You cried your heart out. And to buy it again, your father is no more. But I have tried very hard Janu. Don't mind even if it's not close to the original. Please. You blow whistles for Salman Khan movie on the first day first show, your percentages, your likes, dislikes, angry moments etc, I know all of these. You drank vodka on your friend birthday party when all the others forced you. You were down with fever for the next two days. Never mind, next time when you drink vodka, let me know. Will mix it properly with right amount of soda [Laughs] Is this enough Janu to know about you. If knowing one another is what love means, then we can know every detail about them in a week. Love is not knowing about one another, it's about building the trust that we can do anything for them. - [Pounding on door] The fact that I am in REC college, standing here right now and talking to you is to build that trust and prove that I can do anything for you. I love you Janu. Sorry sir... Leave me. - Bloody idiot. I love you Janu. - How dare he got an gun to the college? Leave me. I love you Janu. Move. Rascal. Scoundrel. Do you think yourself as a hero? How dare you do rowdyism in college, you bugger. This is not Rudra place to show your power. I'll break your bones. - [Cell phone rings] [Phone rings] If this repeats then I will arrest you and encounter in the cell. - Hello. Yes. Rudra sir is on the call. Damn this guy. Sir. - Inspector. How can you arrest my person, what the hell do you think of yourself. Are you a hero? Do you want to live in Warangal or not? Sir, didn't knew that he belongs to your group. Got a complaint from the college, so arrested, will leave him right away. Mahesh... - Sir. Send that guy. - Okay sir. Go. You like me that much. How else should I prove you? Friends? Come on.. friends. [Music] "Fallen in love with you who is searching for me without my knowledge" "Started to love you" "As your heart initiated me to take those steps for you" "Lips which don't know the language" "Now know the only language called love" "The atmosphere of my heart is filled with sheer happiness" "Oh my love" "Forever, forever, forever" "It's a feeling worth a spectacle" "Forever, forever, forever" "It's a feeling worth a spectacle" "Fallen in love with you who is searching for me without my knowledge" "Started to love you" "As your heart initiated me to take those steps for you" [Music] "Though we meet often, he never touches me" "Never lets his hand have a feel of mine" "Filled with lot of craziness" "Pride which can never be altered" That's nice...one more...one more... "Are you the prince who walks along with me" "Like you so much that you have become my breath" How many times should I call you, been trying to reach you since morning. Where all should I search for you. Janu is very angry on you. It's ok, you might be in some tension, or else why won't you answer Janu call. Tell me buddy, what's the problem? I told you we are friends. Nothing, just leave it. - Are you angry? You look so handsome even when you are angry. Janu. - [Cell phone rings] Answer the call. Mother, let me speak to her. - Janu, no. Hello, mother. - Manu? This is Janu speaking, Manu's friend. Is Manu fine dear? He is doing good. It's been a while that Manu visited us. It will be nice if he comes home this Deepawali. For the last 2 years we haven't celebrated festivals. I will bring Manu... Is it? For sure, will celebrate the festival together. "Forever and ever" "Let this remain as a spectacle" "Forever and ever" "Let this remain as a spectacle" My mobile battery is getting drained, will call you from another mobile. Manu, start the vehicle. - Yes sir. Move aside. - Lets go. "Fallen in love with you who is searching for me without my knowledge" - Salman! "Started to love you as your heart initiated me to take those steps for you" What happened? - Need to submit the project. Got only two days time. Don't worry, I will do it. You? - Yes. "The atmosphere of my heart is filled with sheer happiness" Excellent. What did you study? The other day you came as lecturer and now project... MCA discontinued. "Forever and ever" "This is a new beginning" "Forever and ever " "This seems to be a spectacle" [Cell phone rings] What's up... Is it Janu? - Yes sir... Carry on... Hello. - Great applause for the project. Everyone liked it... And it is all because of you. I like you. Say it again. - I like you. I like you. One minute. - Okay. Hey Dhana, make it fast. Sir. Tell me. You were rocking as a lecturer, why don't you try... Start the vehicle... Hello. Manu. Hello. - I will call you later. Okay. Kaka, Muthireddy went to London to see his daughter, this is the right time to wipe of his men. All the time you just want to get into those issues. First eat. Lakshmi. Coming... Serve food to Rudra... - Ok. Got a call from Hyderabad party office, you are confirmed as District youth leader. From here on you are politician Rudra. But I don't need all these Kaka. After me, it's you. After me. Serve him the head curry. It's very tasty, eat. You will die if you smoke these many, come, let's go. Yes, sir. [Song playing] Why sad songs all the time. I will be the first. [Laughs] You didn't come inside, but had you, then you would have tasted the curry which aunty cooked. [Sniffs] The gravy was delicious. If aunty served good food, then Kaka said some good news too. From here on this Rudra is politician Rudra. Kaka is offering us power without even asking. No matter what, Janardan Kaka is great. That day it was not Muthireddy who attacked you and tried to kill you? Then who is it? Its Janardan Kaka... What the heck? Stop the vehicle. [Brakes squeal] It's not starting. I saw you somewhere... [Gunshot] [Groans] Don't kill him. You bloody. [Gun cocking] Call him. Call Kaka...call him. And turn on the speaker. [Line ringing] Tell me. - Sir. We have killed Rudra. Should we hide his body in the mill? I need to see his dead body. Okay, sir. [Preachings from Gita] [Cell phone rings] What are you doing? - Nothing...tell me. I can't sleep. Are you a virgin? What? - [Gunshot] What's that sound? What else? Treated me like your son and also said I will be your political heir, then what made you kill me? What happened to you when you tried to kill me? Sunil, send one lakh rupees to Shekar wife, was with us all these years. Ok, sir. Sir. - Hmm. You are thinking that you need political support for your business and that mayor is using you for his business. Kaka is a good person, even we also need political support. Why can't you be the Mayor, then we don't even need him. Becoming Mayor is not as easy as killing people, got it? Do I look like a thug to you? Am I a thug? - [Glass smashed] Everyone thinks the same sir. Is he a good human or what? Long ago in Kumarapelli, he used to be a street fighter. Worked at Yadav Reddy place, father of Muthireddy. One fine day, he executed Yadav Reddy and became the Mayor. After that incident Muthireddy has lot of anger against him. Prabhakar, anything will happen if its destined to, it's all about the right time for things to fall in place, then Janardan will be in the place of Yadav Reddy. We don't need him anymore. These thoughts are dangerous, that's the reason I planned your murder. So, if I have to survive, then you should die. Likewise, Kaka has to die so that I won't get killed. Brother. Come. [Groans] Do you need the Position of Janardan? I laid this path with lot of dead bodies to reach this position, do you need it, tell me, do you need this? Come on... Come on... - Wait. Manu, take the gun. Don't do it. - Shoot him...shoot... Shoot him... Shoot... I cannot kill sir. Don't do it...don't do... - [Gunshot] Giving life is very difficult, but killing is very easy. [Thunder rumbling] 'Breaking news.' 'The Mayor of Warangal, Mr. Janardhan is missing.' 'Investigation is on, will soon get hold of the criminals.' 'How dare someone can lay his hands on Kaka amidst my presence.' 'Who is he? Where does he live?' 'Those initial days of Manu and Jennie' 'Difficulties faced by him to interact with her,' 'to see her without her knowledge, signs to communicate.' 'Those fun filled days' 'and archived messages.' I love you. [Gunshot] [Crying] How can you marry a person who has hit your brother? Manu didn't hit wontedly. Shut up, what the hell are you talking? is he more than your brothers. Brother. Enough Jennie. Inspite of all these, if you still want him, then kill us and leave this place. Ashamed to say that you are my daughter. [Crying] I made a mistake Manu. Forgive me. I only thought of my brothers but never imagined that you will become like this. Whatever may happen, let the society think whatever it has to. I will take care of you Manu. I am coming. Why don't you leave all this rowdyism and that field. Hey, stop here. This is what happens when you spend time with your loved ones. I had a great time, thank you. Even Janu liked your family a lot. Don't miss me too much, bye. We get so lost in our own sadness that we forget to enjoy the goodness surrounding us. God gives us what we deserve. Not what we desire. Hi. - Hi. Bye Janu. - Bye. Hey Janu, did you read the blog which my favourite blogger Ayesha wrote, titled Manu Charitra. Interesting love story. Lover turned as a rowdy. The protagonist name is Manu, while I was reading I found out so many interesting and similar elements between that Manu and your boy friend Manu. Once go through it. Manu Charitra. Thanks. Love problem? Don't worry. Your love will succeed for sure. All the best. Thank you. Jennie. Why don't you speak when I call, give the phone to Jennie. Wrong number...idiot. One person is torturing me since two days by calling me Jennie. Hey Janu, block the number. - That's better. My mobile battery is getting drained, will call you from another mobile, wait. Okay. [Brakes squeal] [Cell phone rings] Tell me. - Nandu, did you see my wallet? Haven't seen it here... - Just find it. There's Jennie photo in it. Will find it, don't worry. Nandu, I only got one photo of Jennie. - [Cell phone rings] Did you check with Janu? - Please Nandu... Hello. Hello Manu... Hello Manu. - One minute. Manu. This is Janu speaking. Manu. Did you love Jennie? Yes...to forget her, did you love all those girls. Yes. Is it the same reason why you loved me? Tell Manu? Yes. What do you think of me? Just to forget someone, how can you use me like a medicine. In ten days you can know everything about a girl, but you couldn't know her feelings. Any girl will think that the person who comes into her life belongs to her. But you just made me one among those who just came and went away from your life. How could you cheat me? Instead of changing your mindset, you changed the girls in your life. Been waiting to say 'I love you' to you for a long time, but that sentence is not new to you. That's the reason I hate you, I hate you. Don't even show your face to me. Goodbye. Love, well being, lessons, pain, but never thought it will give me so much of pain. Let it go. [Laughs] What happened? Nandu, I want Janu. I want Janu... Janu, I love you. How long will it take to know the whereabouts of Kaka. Let me know if you can't find out... Sir, we are searching... Will find about Mayor soon... I doubt Muthireddy, he must have done something to Kaka... Just ten days before this incident Muthireddy went to London to see his daughter... So what, his men are here. Even you belong to his group... What are you speaking? Are you capable of finding Kaka? Sir, investigation is going on. As early as possible, we will find our mayor, sir. Ok. I'll see you, sir. Something is fishing. This is the site location of K S Nandan. - Is it? Sir... What happened to you for the last two days. You were not even reachable it seems. I went on a tour with Janu. - Is she fine? Yes sir. Sir... Do you need money? No... I am thinking of leaving this job. How dare you! Just stay calm... Sir, Jennie left me in lot of pain, and now I can find the same pain when Janu is leaving me. Janu doesn't like all these, I need Janu... I would like to live as she wants. Please, I need her sir. Ok. You want to start a new life for Janu. Go happily. You are like my brother. - Thanks. Janu... Janu... Janu... Manu please. - Please, try to listen to me. Janu, kindly listen to me. Janu, listen to me. Janu, listen, I need to speak to you once. Just listen to me. I love you Janu. To how many more girls you will say this sentence. What I did was a mistake. To forget Jennie, I did say I love you to many girls. Also broke up with them. Bloody life, from Devdas to the current lovers, just to forget the girl we loved, we get used to all sorts of bad habits, smoking, drinking, drugs, but they don't know one important thing Janu, the moment when the thought of forgetting her hits their heart, then from that same very moment, the girl is not in their heart. Even I didn't knew until you left me Janu. I didn't come here to convince you by saying something else. Just came to tell you how much I like you, also one more thing, even if you leave me and go, I am not going to get into bad habits. Because your love is my drug. And I will never forget you until my death. I love you, Janu. [Music] "Have filled my whole heart with your love" "Each and every cell of mine is filled with you" "Living each and every moment of my life with you" "I wake up to each day just for you" "Whether you are with me or not, I am always with you" "You are the heartbeat of my life" "Even if you don't want me" "Or asking me to get lost" "All I can do is love is my love" 'You look handsome in beard look, just like John wick...' Brother. - What happened, sir? "This is the reality of my life" Give me demo class, Manu. [Music] Sorry. I made a mistake, forgive me. "It feels good to have you in my heart" "Which makes every second a festival" "I am just staring at the mirror" - Wow! "Started to like myself more than ever before" "Whether you are with me or not" "I am always with you" "You are the heartbeat of my life" "Even if you don't want me" "Or asking me to get lost" "All I can do is love is my love" "This is the reality of my life" "Have filled my whole heart with your love" He completely changed person. He really likes you, Janu. Please understand him. I am sorry Nandu, leaving to Gujarat soon. You are an educated guy, tell me the truth. What's the reason behind the missing case of Mayor Janardan? I don't know sir. - You know it. [Music] "Did the past smile at you in a new way" "Has the story changed in a better way" "I am here only for you" "This life is dedicated to you my dear" "Whether you are with me or not" "I am always with you" "You are the heartbeat of my life" "Even if you don't want me" "Or asking me to get lost" "All I can do is love you my dear. This is the reality of my life" Janu is going to Gujarat today, go and talk to her once, she will be convinced. Nandu, I am going to use your bike for two more days. Does this make any sense. Manu, Janu is also thinking a lot. Just go and speak to her once. Leave it. Hiding a fact is much more a bigger crime than murder, hope you are aware of it. It's time for my class sir. Can't he understand? [Phone chimes] Thank you. 'Breaking news.' 'On the outskirts of Warangal near Vaddepalli lake...' 'some unidentified dead bodies have been found.' Yes sir, all dead bodies have been recovered. Look here. 'Move away.' 'C.I Ravi Kumar just stated that out of those dead bodies,' 'one has been identified as the dead body of missing Warangal Mayor,' 'the police department further went onto state that it is Rudra' 'who has killed the mayor' 'and they do have substantial evidence to prove the same.' - [Cell phone rings] Mr. Rudrapratap, we got the information of Mayor, will get the forensic reports in sometime, will come to arrest you with proofs, get ready to eat jail food, by the way, it was one of your person who revealed everything, here will always be someone who will give us tit for tat. Who told him? Who is that? Who told him? Who informed the police? Who is he? Who? Who told him? Who told him? Is it you? Or you? - Brother. Prabhakar, none of these people should be alive. Why should we kill our own people sir? I have been telling you regarding the meetings between Manu and inspector, but you never believed. Have a look at these images of their meeting this morning. Exactly after one hour of their meeting, all the dead bodies came into light, he is the proof. How dare he backstabs me. Kill him where ever he is.. - Ok sir. Go... [Phone vibrating] [Cell phone rings] Bro... - Nandu. Sir told his men to kill Manu. Where is he? He is not answering calls, somehow inform him urgently. Sir is very angry. What are you saying brother, how can sir think of killing Manu? I will go and speak to Rudra sir. Why do you want to go? Just inform him. Bro, what happened and where are you going without having food. [Train announcement] Janu. I know the reason behind your sadness, it's because of distancing yourself from your loved one, and I know it because, I am that person who is feeling sad for leaving him. Jennifer... Came to India upon knowing that his life has become like this because of me. And I am came here after knowing how much he loves you and how he might end up if you leave him, it's very scary to imagine. Manu likes me Janu, but he likes you even more. No matter what heights we reach in life, but if we don't have the person whom we love the most next to us, then that life is waste Janu. Love is such a crazy thing, it brings two hearts closer and separates two people, don't know why. As time passes by, the anger on parents who have forced us to marry someone else subsides. Even the guilt of hiding our past from our husband also subsides gradually. What stays with us forever is the love which we have on our loved ones. And to live with that feeling is the most hardest one Janu. That time unknowingly you gave your phone which united us, and now I shouldn't be the reason for your break up. Manu is a good person Janu. His love is genuine. He might have loved you to forget me, but he loved you as what you are. As of now Manu might remember me, but you are in his heart. Kindly accept his love Janu... Please... Sorry Manu. So make sure you check all your errors before you submit it. [Phone vibrating] One second. - Okay, sir. Hello. Janu. Where are you? I am at Khajipet railway station. I am going to Gujarat. The train will arrive in half an hour. Would like to see you once before I leave. Coming Janu. What are you discussing? No matter how much it costs. No one should even touch me. Orugallu is the fort of Rudrapratap. Sir, his friend has come. Brother. Come here, where is Manu? How much I trusted him. How dare he betrays me. Are you still believing that he said about you to the cops. Manu likes you a lot sir. This guy never liked Manu right from the beginning, he only must have revealed what happened. What is this nonsense? Just look here. Is it a fact that Manu and the police met? These guys are not trust worthy sir. Sir, you are very much aware of Manu. No matter what it is, I am going to kill him for sure. If that's the case, then I will kill you sir. Nandu, no, wait. - I will kill you. Come, kill me. Sir, it's my mistake, forgive me sir. [Crying] Is life spoiled once because of me and very recently he started to live like the old normal Manu. I beg you sir, please leave him. Sir, it happened accidentally... forgive me. At least you tell. - They are just kids. Don't know anything - Sir...sir... It's my fault. Sunil brother. Sir...sir... - Brother. Please bro. Sir, sir, sir... Please...sir... [Cell phone rings] Sunil bro, I was in class when you called me. Manu. Rudra killed our Nandu. What are you saying? How can Rudra kill Nandu? You just run away to a different place, he will even kill you. I am coming, wait. - No. Manu, why did you come here instead of going away? They will kill you... Main, wait. Manu. [Crying] Nandu! Nandu. Nandu, get up. Nandu. Nandu. Nandu, I'm here. Wake up. 'Why don't you die once and for all instead of dying daily?' Nandu, how can you die like this? [Crying] [Screams] Nandu. Nandu. Manu. You came here to get killed in my hands. How dare you kill my friend? What did he do to you? Why did you kill him? Guys, kill him. No, just stop there. How long will you keep killing people for his sake. Shekar, Vikram and now this guy. He even decided to kill you all. He is a demon who will kill his own men for his selfishness. At least realise now and change. Move. Prabhakar, kill him. Thank you. Prabhakar. Guys at least you kill him. Come on. What happened to you? Rudra does not need any help. [Groans] Stop! [Train announcement] 'The customer you are trying to call is unreachable at this moment.' Beat him. Stop. [Sobbing] Rudra Pratap. [Laughs] [Gunshot] Nandu. Order, order.
