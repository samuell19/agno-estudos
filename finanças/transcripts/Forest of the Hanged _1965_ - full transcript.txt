The Forest of the Hanged Directed by Livu Ciulei Damn it. The wind stared blowing. Move up!Stop starring at me. Move faster! At your service Sir! At what hour is it? It should have started at 4 o'clock, Sir! I report i'm going to be late. Now it's 5 o'clock. Who are you hanging? We don't know! We heard that it could be an officer but we are not sure. Aren't you ready corporal? The convoy left Ready, Lieutenant! In a few minutes they'll be here. But where is the master sergeant? Why didn't he came earlier? The master sergeant had to be here already. where is the chair,corporal? Why do you stare like and idiot? On what would you like the convinct to climb? We should use you as a chair! Now get lost! Allow me to introduce myself:Lieutenant Apostol Bologa. Klapka.Otto Klapka I was transfered from the italian battlefield to this division. I just arrived. At the railway station i heard that an execution is about to begin. Yes I can't really understand how did i got in this place So you moved in this division. Yes In the 50th Field Artillery. Ah, right in our regiment! Then, welcome! So, who are you hanging? Hm, a czech sub-lieutenan. Svoboda is his name. He was caught right when he was trying to switch sides. Outrageous, isn't it? Yes, of course. I had the honnor to be in the Court-Martial.He didn't even defend himself. He looked at us in a strange way. I believe he was trying to defy us. Though... it wasn't defiance. It was something else.He didn't say a word. Do you smoke? No, no. Otherwise it would have been useless. Even myself, a reluctant person that i am, this time, the proofs were evident. The evidences... The evidences... Mr Captain, you forget that we are on the front. It looks like you are a reserve officer. Otherwise, you wouldn't talk like that about a crime. Yes, you are right. I am a lawyer durring peace. But now... I'm a reserve officer too! The war drag me out from the book univers from the University where i almost lost contact with real life. What are you studying? Filosophy. Have you ever attended an exection by hanging? No. Excuse me. What is this? What have you brought? It's to high, can't you see? How can the convinct climb on it?Ah! Here comes the convoy. Get out! Get out of the hole! Lieutenant Apostol Bologa from the 50th Field Artillery. At your command,sir! Accidentaly, i came earlier and i saw that the necessary chair was missing. Was missing? Corporal, were is the executioner? I report, sir, we don't know! We only came here to dig the grave. How come you don't know, you idiot? Where is the master sergeant? At your service Sir. What did you do you bastard? Where is the executioner?I'm gonna... 30 days of imprisonment. And now... Corporal, you are going to be the executioner. Mr colonel, i report... please forgive me... Mr colonel! Get back! Get back! God is good and great... It fractured. What? The button fractured, Father. Got it? On the other side, Father, please. I would like more order, for Christ sake! God is good and great... Get back! Everybody go back! Get back! Everybody 3 steps back! Make way. Doctor, does it take long? You'll see... Good lord... If it's possible, to die quicker... What? See what does he want. Say it. What do you want? Then... Attention! Commands from the brigade officers. The Court-Martial of the soldiers commandment found the sub-lieutenant Ian Svoboda as being guilty of desertion crime and espionage crime stated in Paragraph no.341 from the military justice code. For this, the Grand Commandement according to the exceptional disposal no.32183, degrades him by condemning to death by hanging. This adjudgement was released today, 18th of October 1916. Signed by General Karg. At your command, sir. Ok, ok. Withouth the coat. Come on. Go ahead! Take out your mess jacket! A soldier in his uniform cannot be a executioner! The chair.Pull it. 5...6...7... He died fast. No comment, be kind. So what's the result? Sir, the convinct is dead. Then, let's go on. Sir, the decision has been well-made. Soldiers... It's cold. Farewell... Mr Captain, It was instructive. When the crime is evident, the law... The military honnor was splashed, we only did our job. The job...When it comes to the life of a person... What are you? I'm talking about the nationality. Romanian. Yes sir. I'm czech... Bologa... what a name. A led soldier. You know? My husband has a chess table with led soldiers. And you're a led soldier! Yes, a soldier that in an hour is about to die. After i take a good meal at the canteen. You're great. You're like me. In order to die, we have to kill ourselves 100 times. But you... you're scrimshanking. And today you flushed from the execution. I did that for you. Hm... for you... Are you scared? wait. What? Weren't you at the.. No. Why, why would i need that? It's an unpleasant show. I've seen that in Italy. My dear... dont be upset... You know... she came here because all the people were there and there wasn't anybody able to see her. Forgive me. Try to understand me. Rosa? Discretion... Thank you. I'll see you at the canteen. How did he act? Good evening. With obedience i report sir: my son came for 2 days from the front. Here you go. No,thanks. You could use a glass of wine. What's new on the front, soldier? well, at God's mercy. Clean my boots please. Continue. The food is getting cold. Eat. It's enough. But i didn't finish... Good evening. Eat. Stay still! Doctor! The dinner is ready in an hour. A snaps Mr Bologa. Ah, Muller... Boiled snaps. This is what i learned There is no place to take a seat. Come with me I have a small.. a small place. This is your shelter? This is only the purgatory. A bit smelly. What about the Paradise? Immediately. It's small and romantic, except the small which is everywhere.Over here Geniune museum piece. In fact, here is where the centuries confound. The styles... rococo, canzon... past... present. And the future... here. Get in. As french say. Johan Marian it's you name? Yes Iohan Marie Muller...it doesn't suit the uniform. Santa Claus. You are worried. I was there too. Are you playing an instrument? Yes, a little bit. Do you wanna play somethin? You welcome The guilt was evident.Even superior to man, to his particular interests... It's the country. Nothing is superios to man. The man... The man with his ugliness and his beauty. With the pain, with the fear... With the blind searching of a blind God. The man is everything Mr Bologa. And this is his girlfriend. Fiancee. He is wrighting pasional letters to her. He is keeping himself for her. Really? More than sure. Don't be... What is his name? Bologa... and...? Apostol. Apostol! It's getting better and beter. Why? For what? For the country? A bastard country which sends you to... Please shut up Muller! Please forgive me. Utopia...Help you carry on. You are a happy man, Muller. I would be if.. If? If i could hate. A holy hour, destructive. That should rise us above the trenches full of blood. To destroy. Destroy who? who? All the ones who lead us. Who lead us one against another.Who exploit us since ages. I don't know... I don't know I don't understand a thing: Why are you talking to me if you don't care about my words? It calms me down. It calms me down your faith in a new and happy world that will become out of the furry and violence. What is you occupation as a civilian? You told me before but i forgot. Antitank, as my grandfather, as my father, in Vienna, in the basement of the house where Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lived for 17 days. And you are singing too. You're playing the flute. Yes... You see... The things are much more complicated. Dangerously complicated. Every man has his truth. And Spovoda had his own truth? What's wrong Bologa? Were you ashamed to come earlier between us? Ashamed? By what? We know you voted for the death punishment. And? I don't have to justify to no one but my conscience. And your conscience is rested? No conscience is the world can constrain me to kill a man. Gentlemens, in the last 3 hours we only talked about Svoboda's execution... For 1916 years, the humanity is talking about Christ execution. Gentlemens, let's not make wrong comparisons, please. Mr Captain Cervenko is an adept of non-violence. In the attack he takes a stick. In his hand does not carry a weapon in order no to be bound to kill someone. It's the influence of a russian writer...Tolstoi if i am not wrong... We need Agony. A lot. Huge. Only in agony it appears and it grows the real love. The love, my dear people, the love... The love in which we dabble... It feeds us with bullets and gallows. Just words... Everything is much more simple. We talk mr captain, to forget a little bit about the trenches, the death. We talk but we all do our job. All! Mr Captain Cervenko starts the attack with a stick, but he goes there. Bologa is a romanian and fights here, on the romanian front. You are czechs and you are the one who wanted to attend Svoboda's hanging. Why gentlemens? Because the emperor represents discipline. Otherwise it becomes anarchy. And the anarchist and socialist and others... this is just what are they waiting for. In our divison it is a guy, a bit strange. A soldier called Johan Marian Muller. He dreams at an international army. Here it is: Bologa is romanian, mr captains are czechs, mr doctor is polish and the preast is german, i am hungarian, mr captain Cervenko is a russian. What about you boy? What are you? A soldier sir! Of course. But i mean what nationality are you. Croatian, sir. Do you see? A real imperial international army. Discipline! Is not that simple. We need love. Oo, i agree with that. As many as possible and with any ocasion. Forgive me, Father... Gentlemens, wouldn't it be better for us to sing something togheter? A beautiful lied, or something romantic old and decent? I'm sorry but i have to go in trenches. Properly talking, i'm happy, but if we are going to philosophize more, you are going to convince me that the act of deserting is a heroic one. Shall we go? What else can i do? A romance mr doctor? I don't have the voice. I prefer wine. Thank you for the invitation. I hope that tomorrow they are going to use me for something. What is this? I was told that over here the atmosphere is calm. Nothing... The ones from the other side are crazy. Its been a week since they stared bothering us with a projector. Completely useless... on some still positions, were you can see any ant hill. But what's ridiculous and annoying is the fact that we are not able to destroy that toy. The ones from the other side...romanians... The enemy... Here you go. You can sleep in my bed. What a strange smell is in here. Just like in the old days. Mr lieutenant Varga has some galant visits from time to time. I'm tired. He was guilty mr Captain. He was guilty! We are all guilty Here. Take a drink. I don't usually drink. That's exactly what i'm saying. Drink it. Drink it until you'll feel like you don't know anything. Hell with that! Don't curse the light. There is so much darkness that every light is welcomed. It doesn't matter where does it come from or when it comes. It's so hard for me... In war i lost everything: Faith in God, That secure feeling that life is supposed to give you... And i didn't get anything in exchange. But what were you expecting to achieve? Myself. Or... to get rid of me. In the middle of the general fear of death, I thought that i was going to get rid of fears, of my doubts... I could get rid of war... I could get rid of war, do you understand?? I'm a romanian. My dad stayed several years in prison because of the national ideal. But everyone would have looked at me with clemency. As a boggler. As a child Even my fiancee, Martha. We've known each other since childhood. Since i was 10 i knew i was going to marry her. She was looking at me protectively, and her eyes were blinking not evil nor filthy, after the officers that were crossing the city trought the front. But i wanted to show to all of them of what i am capable of. I signed up as a volunteer. I fighted in Gallitia and i won 3 medals. I prooved to myself that i am not afraid of death. I did my job as a soldier, as an officer, as a man! Who doesn't ask himself "why,why?" as a floozie, as an invalid. Poor child... Why are you calling me like that? Because the real courage is to see things the way they are. Never lie to yourself. The real courage would have been not to come on the front. To defy other's opinion, even your woman that you love. I know. Now i know. From today, since i saw Svopoda's eyes. Since i met you. So human, so brave. You had the courage to defend Svopoda today at the canteen, even if you are also a czech. It could have been interpretated... Thank you. Even if i should curse you as i curse the light of this innocent projector which comes from the other side from my people! Believe in what? in something superior than us. I can't... They reached it... Shall we go? Yeah. I ate too much. I'm too greedy. Since with this war, i eat as if... i'm always afraid not to starve. Good morning, you beautiful girl! Varga! Sandor! Cervenko was killed. He was patroling to identify that damn pojector of the other ones/ I'm sorry Bologa. It wasn't on purpose. A lost bullet... He lived half a hour after that. He was crying and kept repeating: "the love, the love, only the love." I brought him from the wires. I'm going to sleep. Mr captain Klapka i've been looking for you in the whole village. The general asked for you. Yes. Attention! Hystorical monument. A damn thing that they bombed it. The right side is untouched. Forward? No, no. Turn right. Yes. Frames look like Renassance. But the style is Baroque. A real cruelty. It burned 3 days long. Come in. Captain Otto Klapka from the 50th Division Artillerry, at your command, sir! Ah yes. Mr captain Klapka...very well I called you... to know you... and.. to ask you something. It looks like you did you job well but... please take the lunch with me. You didn't eat, right? I... no, sir. I'm honnored. Your patriotic decision to attend at the execution of the czech traitor, made a good impression for me. Are you czech? Yes, sir. Very well. I eat a lot in the morning: Breakfast The english method. I know... i know it was hard for you... The croissant is baked by my cook from Vienna. I brought him with me. Please It was hard and that's why i appreciate your patriotic action. Before that you fighted on the italian front. I know. I... your honour... Please have some creampie. Attention. It's good that you're here. Come in. What a dog weather... Bad weather. What are these? Popcorn? Popcorn. Like in the old times. Do you remember? You were little and you were coming from the slay playing. Yeah. Sir, with obedience I report: what? I've known you since you were little. Mr Lieutenant, i am asking you as a good and clement God, my son... Petre. Yes... It's my only son, mister... and he has a small baby. And i can die, because i lived my life, and him... he barely opened his eyes to the world, mister.... Please have mercy and take him, Because i'll teach him to shine shoes and other things And you are free to beat him if you're not satissfied. He is my only son, mr lieutenant, mister... When you were little and you were coming at us with your mom and dad... I'll go in the troups instead of him My heart is dying inside everyday when there is an attack... Please have mercy... Petre, you know very well that is not up to me. It's up to you... only if you want to... Because you're a hero and you have medals and the general shakes your hand with respect... Take me to die instead of him... because... I'll see what can be done, Petre. I promise you Eat sir before the food gets cold. It's so good you came. I also have some rations. Even if i don't drink. For friends. What is it? Something happened? Bologa, you must destroy the projector You must destroy it. What? Shall we kill the light? We must. But it's harmless. They have that projector from the french. And they are getting brave with it. The light is good, Otto. No matter where does it comes from...In all this darkness. Lieutenant Bologa, i command you to destroy the projector. I understand mr captain. I'll do everything i can. Just the way the whole divison of artillery is doing for 2 weeks, when this projector came up. Apostol, forgive me. Try to understand me. The general called me at his place. He asked me why was i moved from the italian front. The general knows. Do you understand? He knows... What does he know? I'm a coward, Apostol. One of the most disgustful cowards. I lied to you. I acted as a brave man. I said things... Big words... I had to get rid of Svoboda's look... His look unde the rope. The obsession of those eyes... I've seen those eyes before. On the italian front. 4 officers. all czechs. They were all determined to switch sides. I was afraid... and... I hided away from them. I hided as a thief. They were caught between the lines. All 3. I couldn't take the risk. I have a wife, childrens, I love her... Look. How are they supposed to live withouth me? I have to live no matter what. No matter what, but i have to! In front of the Court-Martial they remained silence. All 3. But i'm sure i was also suspected. And something like that is not forgetable. I went to their execution. To show... To demonstrate That there is no connection between me and them Hm... That's why i was yesterday at Svopoda's hanging. But why do you think the general called me? If you don't destroy the pojector, he is going to believe that i... i, it's so hard... My mouth is dry Yes I moved from your place. Bologa... please... for me. The projector... destroy it Battery, fire line! Fire! Corection 5 thousand to the left. Fire! Fire! Fire! Ah. He got away once again! What did you do, Bologa? It showed up in you sector. Right ahead! It was a simple job to shoot it. I've been told that you are the best artilerry officer of the division. How is this possible? Your honor i report. It was impossible to destroy the light. Mister Apostol, you are a very lonely man. You don't love anybody but you. There is nothing mentioned about the loneliness and love in the active military regulation, mr captain. It's not good. Like that. 1..2..3..4 No, no, i can't. Doctor, the wounded transport has arrived. Not like that! It's not good. Like this 1,2,3,4... Apostol Take care not to get sick. Come on. Let's go home Come on. Home Good evening. Mrs Rozenaiosi there's a letter for you. Thank you. Wait! There you go. Take them. They are mine. My respects to you,Mrs Mr lieutenant, please be kind... There's so much mud... At your service. Thank you. Lieutenant Apostol Bologa. I'm Mrs Rozenaiosi. Thank you. At the castle. Ah...at the comandment. Take me please. I have something to do at the commandment. Mr Bologa... Take this stamp...from Italy. Probably you collect them. Thank you, i haven't but... From my husband. He is fighting there. That's all. Forgive me. You are definitely concerned because of the Colonel. But now in Italy is quite easy. Could you give me... A cigarette? Yes.... Thank you In his writings he asks me to take care of the family crypt. Do you live at the comandment? At the castle. My husband is the nephew of the castle. It his 300 years old. The castle... My husband was 50 when we got married. What about you? I believe you signed up as a volunteer. Yes... But now... I did it involuntary. Excuse me... i smell of alchohol. I have something too. I usually take it for the wounded. But how are we going to drink it? Just a moment please... Like this: There you go. It remained some lipstick on your lips. Thank you. Good evening. Mr Bologa... Please.. Ah yeah... Please forgive me... You're just a child... No... Come on, help me. Come on. Come to my place to clean yourself. Over here. Madamm... Shht... Mrs Ianosi... Can't you see that you are waking up all the commandment? Let's go upstairs. And when they bombed the castle... I was the only man happy. I kept laughing on and on. They thought i was crazy. Madam... i want to ask you... Don't go. You stay here. Don't leave me. Don't die. At least you, don't die! You are... the only innocent thing, from my whole life. Are you here? Get away from me. Don't go... Don't go. Sir, yes sir! What happened? I don't know.I was ordered to bring you immediately. Bologa, come quick. To tell you. Excuse me. A group of romanian prisoners was captured. we have the chance to hear from them the projector's position. The romanians refuse to talk. They say... I understood. Sir... Sir... They say that they don't know any foreign language. The General has made out of this a personal ambition. Bologa, welcome. I caught them last night. We can't understand each others... And my french... But mr lieutenant say that they don't know french. You'll see... handle them. Do you speak romanian? Your atitude is not accetable. inhuman. The soldiers... It's been 20 hours since we last have something to eat. Our regulation... state in a detailed way,the human treating of the prisoners. You will be treated as brave men. According to your degree. Thank you. I hope so. I would like to know the projector's position. If you had the misfortune to get caught as a prisoner... would you tell the enemy your military secrets? Your country? Forgive me. I am a romanian too. Romanian? and aren't you ashamed? Do you want to cower me, by making me a traitor? And you tell me that you are a brother of us. Get out... Get out! Take them out! Tell to Lieutenant Varga that they don't want to talk. Take them out! Get out! At your command, sir! Get some warm food, a tea, anything... Immediately. Until pronounce the sentence, poor men can die 100 times. Yes, sir. Who allowed you to give them food you morron? I'll send you to prison! I want the law concerning prisoners treatement to be applied strictly. The regulation! The regulation! You keep eating boys. Apostol! Apostol! I didn't see you madamm. Why didn't you look for me? I sent you a note through ordonnance. I also searched you at home. Varga laught at me. But he is a good boy. He understood. He laugh. We broke up. He cares for you. You are afraid of everything. You are afraid. That's why you pretend so bravely.Because you are afraid. Do you think no one sees? Why did you acted like that with poor prisoners? You brutalized yourself. You harmed yourself. You child... I love you... because you are just a child. So...innocent No, no! Apostol! Leave me alone. Leave! You are a... No! No! I love you! You don't know. Get away from me. You don't know... you'll see Leave me alone... You are the only innocent thing. No! Come in. Excuse me... i'll wait outside until you finish your meal. Apostol, stay...stay. I'll eat after that. What is it? I came to report that i'll take the responsability for the projector destruction. Therefore i ask to have the freedom to take any necessary decisions that i find appropriate. Sit. Sit down. Take out these. Apostol, why are you struggling? Why don't you tell me what bothers you? I understand. You tought that i was a man with a special spiritual structure. And afterwards... the deception... I am a humain being, Apostol. That's all. What are you up to? What are you looking for? To destroy the projector. If i am not wrong, you commanded me in a special way. Bagging me, if you remember. The fear determine us to act as if we saw monsters, Apostol. You know... for that story... the general... I don't know. I told you.I narrated to you. Those 3 czechs hanged in Italy... The general... I don't remember. You're deceiving yourself. You didn't narrate me nothing. Apostol... It is so hard.. It is so hard to remain human in all this insane situation where we are? Do you allow me sir, to take all the necessary decisions that i will find appropriate? Lieutenand Bologa. I command you to destroy the projector by taking all the necessary decisions. Understood,sir. After i destroy the projector, I am going to ask you somethin. Apostol, You know that i care for you, just like a brother, even more than that. We will see. Mr lieutenant, the battery(gun) is on the phone. Report. Do not shoot. Why aren't you shooting the projector, Bologa? Are you insane? You allowed me to take all the necessary decisions that i fill find appropriate. The projector will be destroyed. Ready? Untie the hoof. Shut up! Forward! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Get on the horses! Come on! Come on! Leave me alone! Call de doctor. Drink this. No. Drink it! Mr captain! Mr general commanded you to go immediately at the Commandment. Are you injured? No. Wipe yourself. You're full of blood. From now on, the light won't bother us. Mr captain, now i want to ask you something. You have to move me out of here. I have to get away from the romanian front. Anywhere, in Italy, Galitia, anywhere! I can't go on. You promised that you are going to do anything for me if i destroy the projector. I destroyed it! I have to get out from the romanian front. I have to! I have to! I have to! I don't have any power. I am stained. I'm czech. Yes. For them this means traitor. Ok. I will appear in front of the general. What do you want? To congratulate for you heroic act. Mr lieutenant. Get out of here Muller, or i'll shoot you! Well done, Bologa. Congrats. I insisted doing it personaly. I proposed you for the gold medal. I'm proud. Very proud. Your highness allow me to ask you something. Yes. How couldn't i. I listen. A hero. With all my benignity. Your highness, Please do me the favour of transfering me on another front. In Galitia... Anywhere where your highness would find it appropriate. Fine. Even if i feel sorry for losing you. I'm surprised In Galitia and in Italy is very hard. Here on the... Are you romanian? Yes, your highness Romanian. I thought that you do are not differentiating the enemies of the country. And your last action... Despite the destruction of that projector, which costed quite a lot, there were some soldiers too, which seemed to be romanians, just like you. Explain it to me. Your highness, from this point i find myself in a moral impossibility... and.. What? Moral impossibility? What's with those words? I don't know such words! It means that you cheat? You suffer doing your duty towards the country, towards the officer adjuration. Your highness... Not a word! Every word of your worths a bullet. You can leave now. Dismissed Johan. Forgive me Johan. Please forgive me. After the war i'll come to Vienna and i am going to buy a lot of books from you antique shop. And until then? I asked to be transfered on the italian front. Of course. The most important thing is not to shoot your brothers. On the italian front there are no brothers. Only here there are brothers. It's much more comfortable this way. Muller... It doesn't matter that we kill each other. Without knowing why. What matters is not to have remorse. Please shut up. Everyone wants all, only in his own way. And him to get away with a clean scruple. I command you to shut up! Understood. Mr lieutenant. Do you have a light? What's your name? Private Johan Marian Muller. How, mr officers, in my squad there is a pacifistic. Lieutenant Bologa is the one. And there are others soldiers like him, and i didn't know about that until now. I find out only now! Lieutenant Bologa has a remourse. A remourse in war. Upon him there is a disheartening influence... and you... I want soldier Muller out of my team. Please order the to prepare the documents to disband him, Sir. Mr colonel, if it weren't so early in the morning, i though you were drunk. Mr attorney, i am sure you understood. Yes your highness. I need one of you for an important mission. Who offers volunteer, is going to get a 2 week pass. Me. Ok, come. What are you saying? Nothing, whatever. Come on, man. Come on! Let's have rest a while. Let's have rest. No. Smoke it... We did they send us to patrol? Come on. Mozart. Hm? Wolgang Amadeus Mozart. A great composer. Ah... one of your germans... Let me tell you one of ours. Hm... There was a priest in our village... A big drinker... When he woke up in the morning... You have orders to kill me, Peter? Hm, shut up. Shut up. Shut up. You borowed me some money 2 months ago. There you are. I wasn't able to have them all back. But why? I could have waited longer. Why? Why? It wasn't necessary... It wasn't necessary. But where are we going? You'll see Don't rush your fences. Ok Peter, ok. Come on. Let's go I'm not going! be careful! Why should i go? where? I'm not going! No! Oh,come on man... Wait for me. I'm coming. Brother Muller, untill here, we came togheter. From this point, you're going alone. Bring the weapon. Where should i go? On the other side. You can pass. Why should i go? Why do you keep asking silly things? Be happy and leave now... otherwise... Otherwise? Otherwise... You know we can't pass. How am i supposed to pass durring night between the wires? Tell me how! Let's hope mighty God will help you. But.. why? Why? I was commanded to... Do you understand? I don't know, it's not my business... But they wanted to send my son, Petre... Do you understand? And it's better that... Let him have a clean soul. Because he is young and he has to go back to work my land. There is no one else to do that. And what about me? They are going to catch me as lt.Svopoda! And i have 2 children! And a wife! Shht... If they announce me deserter, someone should be punished for that. They already announced you as a deserter this morning. God is protecting us, the good God, Muller. Don't you ever think of coming back! Because you'll send me to trouble. And you still won't survive if you come back. I wish you a good journey. I'm going now. Hey Muller!Why do they call you 'Maria'?This is a chick name! Leave! Get out of here! I sent you in the first line!I don't want to see you!You murderer! All right, mister... Peter told me to light the fire for you... Now!That's it! yeah! Call mr captain Klapka What is it Apostol? Come on in. It's warm. Ah...this truck... I was just writing... to my family. Come on. This night i am going to pass on the other side. What? Are you insane? Do you want to see us hanged? Let's go inside. Alo... Leave us. Apostol, get back to your senses! I'm leaving. This night... I came to say farewell. Just because the meeting with you has unleashed everything inside me. The courage of your words... And... This fear of your being... Nonsense Ah this telegraph... Apostol!

And what do you want to do next? Will you go back to your battery? I had forgotten there is a war going on. And the wonder has turned true... Amen! All this time I have lived with the fear for you not to do anything stupid. We are so small, Apostol. Flies, catterpillars... That's not true! Not true! We are the most beautiful thing in this world. The battery? I don't even want to think about it. This is my pass. I still have some days left. I must inspect my positions. There's something waiting for you. We are always waiting for something! You're crazy... But I'm so happy to see you like this. Lieutenant! Sir. My father. Ilona. Mr. Lieutenant. I'm scared. They went on the fields. I'm scared. They have to do this, Ilona. I'm scared for them not to... I'm scared. Down! Come on! Come on! Down here. Stay here! Don't go! Don't be scared. I wont't. They can kill me if they want. I don't care. Don't think of what my father might say. He was jealous on Petre because he was doing your boots. And when he brought you here, wounded as you were and with your face yellow as a... I waited for you. Every single day. I waited for you. I waited for you! Ilona. I will ask you to be my wife. How could you do this? I'm a peasant, I have no school. Damn this school! The hell with it! Thank you.

Understood, sir! My father didn't come home. Why do they call you back? Bauble. Why are you hitting us, huh? Why? Mr. Bologa. Mr. Bologa. They want to kill them. They forgave me. But the people point the finger at me. This is terrible, but I must say that... Oh, Bologa, welcome, my friend. Imagine that the lieutenant from the Martial Court got ill. We were almost infunctional. That's the reason why I'm here? You know that I have a pass. A pass? My dear friend, these lazy peasants, and what's most important is that there are hungarians between them, under the pretences that they wanted to work thier lands showed up in the line of fire Everywhere around, full of spies, twleve. Beautiful number. Twelve aspostles. Sorry. Please, let me out of this. I refuse. Talk with his excellence. Major. I ordered the hearst to start digging the twelve graves. If you started digging the holes, I don't see why the judgement is necessary. How come you don't see it? We can't hang'em without a proper judgement. They should thank us for not letting them dig their own graves. What did they want? I was appointed judge. Thank God! There is someone there who protects the poor people. If not, the hanging is wating for them. You said you wanted to tell me something. No. Nothing. Get out until I point the canons on you! I feel better now. Let me take you there. Ilona... I will come back to take you. I will be back. I will be back. Hmm, yeah. Search him I... Of course. He was caught in you sector. Body search, documents... Come on You woke me up. Please take out all things from your pockets. Guard him. He doesn't have documents. When did you recovered? Today i got my sector back. I graduated the Mercurial Academy from Vienna... and of course... if it weren't war... If you don't mind... why did you wanted to desert? I see... A wandering moment... That's interesting... Of course... yesterday's spies. They moved fast. The general is not playing around. Well done. What a beautiful weather. Hey sergean! Where is the arrest room? Sir, yes sir! There! Calm down... Bring the key. Where's the arrest room? Right there. Orderly... You're out of your pass? Yes.This morning Someone from my company came into my village and told me... Come on Peter... I'm so glad you came... I promised you through Orderly... Go to the Company, you deliver the impedimenta, get a new uniform and come back immediately. We will get along well. Mister... i walked by your home. The poor lady was crying because he didn't met you. I didn't tell her yet. I need to tell you something else. My father, right in the day he was killed he told me that he didn't killed poor Muller he let him go away. And why didn't he told me? Why? Why did he let me think... We are farmers, we didn't go to school. Now, i'm not returning to the Company. on the front... you take me by Orderly... Peter... Everything comes around in life. That's right But those who should, they don't pay. Yes. Maybe Who knows Come on. Let's go If you don't mind...The gun... Yes Leave us alone. Understood. We only have a few moments. I'm not going to ask you anything. Bologa, Your deposition is terrible. Thank God you haven't signed it. I asked for an instruction increment. You will deny everything. You didn't want to desert. You were just lost. I will plead. We have to hope. In what,Klapka? Apostol, you have to defend yourself! By lying? By lying, by betrayal... No matter what... you have to! You have to! I can't! You have to live! Yes. I should. But in another way... and i don't know how All my life was built on lies. My job. The honor. The elation... The hesitations... At least i met something pure and geniune. A few moments of love... or a little more... which doesn't have a name for me. Now... You see Klapka, I, the same as you, i encouraged the lie, the absurd... the monstrosity. It is normal for the life to revenge on us. To pay. You are insane. You don't realize? Defend yourself! Defend yourself for me! I put my head in this game, i, the suspected one! I will announce you insane! In front of other insane people. The truth is elsewhere. Maybe someday, people will know how to find it. Go now. What is he doing? He doesn't want to live. I only did my job. Sit down and eat. She bagged me so much... She said she kills herself if i don't let her in. Well... we are all human beings. If mr.attorney hears about this, i'm a dead man.
