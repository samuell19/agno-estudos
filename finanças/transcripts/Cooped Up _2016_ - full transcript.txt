There are concerns, and understandable concerns, about our ability to keep this virus out of Australia, and how we'll cope when we do eventually see cases here. If this indeed is the new Ebola or SARS, then more needs to be done. Back in the house. Slowly. - The cops left. Yes. They did. - Cool. Want this back now? - You take one step outside this house, and the police will return. We dancing? - You come closer than 1.8 meters, I sound an alarm, and the police will return. Criminal misdemeanors can have implications for people applying for United States work visas. - What is this? - My name is Dr. Emily Mundy. I'm a medical epidemiologist, Seconded to the hospital. - My name is Jake Ridge. I don't know what the fuck Seconded or epidemiologist means. "Deadly virus hits Sydney." So? - We believe the man you sat next to last night has North African Respiratory Corona Virus and your contact has put you and in turn everyone you had contact with, at risk. - What contact? We watched the news, we didn't make out. - It's a respiratory virus. It's possible by sitting close to an exposed individual, you came into contact through coughing or sneezing. - Shouldn't I be in the hospital or something getting tested then? - You were in hospital. You hit a guard, exposing him and the driver of your taxi. - If you're not a cop, how did you know about my visa application? - The virus you have been exposed to is a notifiable disease. Travel restrictions are imposed on contacts of confirmed cases. You may be concerned that the fatality rate is so high, however the epicurve is based on only small numbers at this point, so-- - I might be concerned if I could follow what the fuck you're saying. - You have been exposed. You may go on to develop the virus. - I both do, and don't, have a virus. I need a phone. - You don't have a phone? - It was in my jeans. They're at the hospital. Can you get them, please? - They were burned. - You burned my jeans? - I'll work on getting you another phone. In the interim, I can contact any family or employers of your situation. Is there any family I can contact for you? - You can contact a co-worker, Panda del Caliente. - How do you spell that? - P for Panda. Then Anda, del Caliente. - Everything you need to know is in these documents. I'll come back tomorrow morning to take your temperature. - What am I supposed to do now? - It's your home. ? Oh? - Shit. What did Panda say? - Uh, I took notes. "Ha ha ha, ha ha ha. "What?" I identified myself, again, at which point Mr. Caliente said he had been nibbling on bamboo all day. He then sniffed loudly, asked if I partied. I replied I did not. He said he had more important people to do. He called me back this morning at 3:34, 3:47, and 4:22, becoming more urgent in his query about partying and suggesting a nibble on his bamboo might chill my bitch shield. - Ah, he's an idiot. I'll tell him when I see him on Friday. - Friday? - We're doing a run of farewell shows up the coast before I head stateside. Friday is Coffs Harbour. I've had a great time. This wasn't it. - Did you read the documents I left you? - The food bit. - The section on the duration of your monitoring. - Oh, you said I needed to be here a day. It sucked, but I did it. - A day while we confirmed primary diagnosis in the index patient. - Allan Kefak? - He's positive. Now we move to the next step in the algorithm: observe and isolate the contacts for 21 days. - No fucking way am I doing 21 days in here. - Elevated heart rate and high temperature will be the first symptoms. If you don't have anything like this, 21 days after exposure, then we know you're fine. - I have to be in the states November 7, so adding forward-- - Okay, if you're negative and comply with isolation, you should be fine by November 1. - No visa issues? - Mm mm. If you're compliant. Otherwise, my hospital may still press charges for the assault of the guard. - Either I do what you say, or you're gonna stop me from going to America. What speed am I doin' doc? - This takes a temperature reading without me needing to touch you. Turn to your side, left ear facing me. 37.1. Other way. And 37.1. You're clear. - I'm see through baby. I need food. - What's that? - Very good for my coat and whiskers. - You ate cat food? - Man food now, mama. - Don't call mama. - Okay. - You do realize that there's been a delivery of food on your doorstep since last night, right? - "In second childishness and mere "oblivion, sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, "sans everything." You wanna work in, mate? For sooth no, verily I did wreck myself on leg day. You're a soft cock, Willy. 'Twas not the softness, but the size that doth entranced your mother. You cheeky bastard. Hey girl. No TV, no internet. The only girl I see wants to talk about viruses. Not you though. All you wanna tell me about is the new lace wing bra. With double hooks. And a new contoured lining. Ooh. Because "One dollar from the sale of each bra "will be donated into research into new "and emerging viruses." Come on. ? Don't wanna go home? ? I wanna stay by the sea? ? I never felt so free? ? Looking up at the sky? Sup? - Your heart rate, it was through the roof. - Huh. Must have been the push ups. - Heart rate was very irregular for a sustained period of exercise. It was a quick spike like you were suddenly excited. - Hm. Are you reading Shakespeare? - Yeah. Really raises me up. - What play were you reading? - Whatever you like. - As You Like It. - That's it. Love that shit. - "All the world's a stage and..." - I'm just a rat in a cage. - You weren't reading Shakespeare. - Yeah, no. The guy dead set can't write a straight forward sentence to save himself. - Okay, I'll let you get back to your reading. - There's nothing else to do. 37.3, you're good. - Where's my mouse traps? - I asked them to put mint in with your next delivery of shopping. - Oh I was going to trap the mouse, not invite him 'round for a lamb roast. - Well mint is a natural deterrent. - Mouse traps are a natural deterrent to mice having functioning spinal chords. You got a problem with killing a mouse? - It's not appropriate for me to have personal comments. We, uh, need to talk about last night. - No. Look, I was bored and I got to thinking about this chick I met after a show once in Byron Bay-- - I'm not judging you. - Great, see you tomorrow, doc. - But if you have the virus, the viral load in your semen, it presents a possible risk. - You said the virus was latent until I had symptoms. - You remembered. That's great. - How little do you think of me that recalling one detail is good going? - We don't know enough about the virus to definitively rule of out viral load appearing in your semen before the onset of visible symptoms. - I got killer sperm. Awesome. - As a precaution, you should make attempts to avoid spillage. - Spillage? - For acts of, uh, self gratification. Consider safe disposal in an appropriate receptacle. - Yeah, okay, I could probably lay my hands on some medical grade old footy socks. - If you're not gonna take this seriously-- - What about saliva, doc? If we kissed, would that present a risk of death? - That a negligible risk. - Because there's no virus in saliva. - Because we're never kissing. - Ah. Of course. Someone told me that mice hate mint. I don't know if that's true but I do know I hate the mouse. I saw Ratatouille on a bus once. The sound was down, but I got the gist, and I didn't like it! Sick, sick shit. Tonight it ends. - What's wrong? - It's nothing. I'm fine. - Is it the stress? - It's the mouse. I think he's dead in the kitchen. Your mint killed him. - Mint is a deterrent. It's not a poison. - Could you check? - You're scared of the dead mouse? - I guess it's true what they say. - What do they say? - When you hunt a mouse, you're really just hunting yourself. - What are you doing? You need to stay on your side of the room. 1.8 meters, you know this. - How's the mouse? - There's no mouse in there. It's a miracle. - What's the glove for? - It's an appropriate receptacle for self gratification. - Oh. Good. Ah. Lookin' for bamboo, my lady? - It's Jake. Bro, she called me. - Who? Your girl. - She's not my girl, she's a doctor. Get her to write you a sick note because the promoter here is pissed. - Tell him, actually, fuck him. He still owes me money for shows last year. Well you're still making it to the states for your trial, yeah? - Nothing's gonna stop that. You know Big Rick? - Big Rick the Bruiser? No, Slick Big Rick With the Leg Dick. The gimmick is he lost 90 % of his leg in an inferno match and then they grafted skin from his dick onto his shin bone? - Oh, yeah, he gets all aroused when he's kicking you. They offered him a contract and then pulled it. He failed a medical. - Drugs? Slick Big Rick With the Leg Dick is straightedge. They got him on a history of concussion. Boom! - That's it? The toy company bankrolling him don't want any bad PR. The point is, what have you got going on right now? If it's a medical thing, you've gotta keep that shit on lock down or they'll use it as a reason not to sign you. - I'm all good, bro, I'm just, resting up at home. What home? Would you prefer a morning or evening slot for internet installation? - Tomorrow morning. I can have a technician with you in three weeks. - If I told you I could be dead by then, would that help speed things up? I'm very concerned for you. - You're lying, Barvinder. My concern is genuine. - You wouldn't lie to me, Barry? Never. - Where's your call center based? Um. Toowoomba. - Did you just look that up? I am definitely in the second largest inland Australian city after Camira, citation required. - You are on Wikipedia. I am well known in the garden city. Ask any of my other notable residents like Geoffrey Rush, or Gina Jeffreys. - What can you see out the window? A kangaroo. - What's it doing? Um. Fighting a wombat. - I like you Barry. I like you too, sir. Our guy can be out on October 31, a late evening appointment? - Joke's on you champ. I could be dead by then. Just like this battery. You must have dropped it. - I was working on getting you a phone. - 11 days without a phone. It's inhumane. - You're here because of a virus that has killed hundreds of people. Devastated families. It's torn through communities. - I'm a battler. - You're warm, comfortable, safe, and have a highly skilled professional checking you everyday. How about a little perspective? - My perspective is I thought you were a bitch the first time I met and then you've spent everyday since proving me right. - I am not a bitch. I'm a field epidemiologist specializing in viral fevers and emerging zoonotic infections. I've helped with virus outbreaks in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, caring and helping people during the most difficult times in their lives and these people? They accepted the fear and difficulties of viruses with more grace and humility than you seem capable of, you selfish, privileged little bitch. - Freetown or Monrovia? - What? - Where in Sierra Leone were you based? - Tread carefully now. - Freetown or Monrovia? - Monrovia. I was a research assistant. - I prefer Freetown. - You wrestled in Sierra Leone? - I went to France to wrestle. Promoter was South African, and he was involved in Sierra Leone putting on a show as part of national celebrations. The people seem to enjoy the shit getting beaten out of me. - Hm. Some things are just universal. - I'm sorry I took your phone. And called you a bitch. And made the jerk off motion. - The phone thing, it's complicated. - Yeah, I get it. You don't want me calling people, creating a panic. - We don't want people calling you. - Calling me? - There's been a little media interest in the man bringing the virus into the country. We're under a lot of pressure to give details about his contacts. - Who are the contacts? Oh. You've got a key, doc. - Excuse me, mate? Hey. Just to be clear, I'm not on your property. I'm on a, it's like a public thoroughfare. - Good for you. - Yeah I've just, I've had a few touchy locals. I'm writing about the person with the deadly virus. The hospital let them loose and we've heard from sources that they're in this area. - Loose? - Yeah. It's a disgrace that they're putting hard working battlers like yourselves at risk of an outbreak. Now, have you seen anything suspicious at all? - No. - Right. Okay. "'Despite the fear of an outbreak, "'things seemed eerily calm,' said the local man." - No, I didn't. - Oh, we've also heard that there's a sus looking African bloke who's been seen in the area quite a lot. He drives taxi. Do you know who I'm talking about? - What's this deadly virus do then? - Uh. It hemorrhages body fluids. You lose vision, paralysis sets in. - Good driver then. - Who's that? - Your mate, the taxi driver, he's blind, paralyzed, bleeding, and still pickin' up fares? - No, well, he might not have the symptoms yet-- - If he asymptomatic, he doesn't present a transmission risk. Except his semen, maybe. Is he having a lot of unprotected sex while driving blind and paralyzed? - Um. Are you a doctor? - I'm a shit hot epidemiologist. - Okay, well, the point still stands, though, that they've let a deadly African virus into Australia. So you're not at all worried about the rumor of an infectious person roaming around the community? - I'm worried about one infectious person roaming my community, and that's you, mate. Fuck off my property. - Yeah, I'm not actually, I'm not on your property. I'm on a public thoroughfare. - Well. You can just fuck off then. Okay. - I saw in the read outs that your heart rate is a little high again. More work outs? - Where's the virus from? - I'm an epidemiologist. I'm not a virologist. - I get hit in the face for a living. - Animal reservoir. It means it's found in animals and it's similar to a Bat Corona Virus, but we've also found it in chimps and camels. - I've got chimp camel flu? - Are you really interested in this? - I got a bit of a personal stake. - We've found a very similar virus in chimps, camels, and humans. But, we can't definitively say how transmission takes place. Maybe chimps bite camels and then they give it to humans. Maybe humans get it from camels. We don't know. Trying to work it out. - Who's "We?" - There's me and two others who are specialists in this. - Just the three of you in the office? - Three of us in the world. There's a woman just out of Geneva, and a man in Brazil. - Wow. The old work Christmas parties must be pretty low key. - We email. Actually I was supposed to meet up with the Brazilian last week at a conference in Oslo. - What happened? - You happened. - Shit. Sorry. Oslo is sweet. - Is there anywhere that you haven't been? - Have tights, will travel. I reckon I can crack the virus transmission better than old mate in Brazil anyway. Oh yeah? How? - Chimps, camels, and dudes all get this virus. - Dudes? - Hm. So you get a bunch of camels, and a bunch of dudes, and like, a pack of chimps, and lock 'em in a room. See who gets sick in what order. - How are you getting human test subjects? - Prisoners. Sex offenders. - You might struggle to get ethical clearance. - Not if we do it in space. - Hm. This is very helpful. - How'd the guy at the hospital get it? - He was an aid worker. Came to Sydney for a conference. Most likely he had contact with an ill person and he wasn't wearing the correct protective equipment. - Allan Kefak was an aid worker? - That's not his name. - What? Why would he give me a fake name? "Hey man want this good seat near the TV?" "Thanks. "Here's my fake name just to fuck with you." - You sure he didn't say Ala Kefak? - Maybe. - It's an Arabic saying. It means "as you like." - Like the Shakespeare play. - More like an Arabic version of "No worries." - Huh. I cracked your virus transmission problem, you taught me Arabic. - I should go. - Where? - What do you mean? - Like, is your shift over, or you have to get back to the hospital, or you got a barbecue you wanna get on the cans? - First, no questions. Off limits, I know. - Actually, I need to get back and write a funding proposal. - Yeah? - Hm. I need money to send a spaceship full of chimps, camels, and sex offenders around the sun. - The mint was for you man. A nonviolent solution. And you shit on it. You literally shit on the mint. - No confirmatory tests? - Oh. - I mean, temperature is just the first indication of the killer virus ravaging my body, but, if you wanna start playing things a little loosey goosy. - Yeah, no, you're right, I'm sorry. 37.2. - And he lives to fight another day. - I should go. - To your date. - We discussed this. - You said we could only talk about things related to my condition. You screwing up the test because of your date is related to my condition. - Who says I have a date? - Heels say you're not going back to the hospital. Makeup says you're meeting someone. And, you know. What? - You're nervous. Dealing with old virus monkey Jakey boy, you're all sweet, but today, something's up. Every day, two times a day, we do the temperature routine but today, you forgot the second test. - No comment. - Hm. Go and enjoy your doctor date. - How do you know he's a doctor? - I know when a girl like you goes on a date, it's not with a guy like me. - What do you do when I'm not here? - That's a personal question, doc. Ooh, you want it. You want it so bad. Yes, yes, yes. Fuck! Wow. - I need you to go to the lounge room right now. - Whatever you say. You didn't drive did you? - Taxi. My date took some pills with dinner. - Viagra? - Pain killers. He had a rock climbing accident. - Ooh. Sounds like a catch. - It made me think. Your lifestyle, it's also very physical and your physique, it's really important to you, isn't it, Jake? - Gotta look good when you're out there in tights. - You have a heavy schedule. Sustain a lot of injuries. - I get sore. Real sore sometimes. - How do you get through the pain? - Eh, I keep in shape. Stretch. Try to eat well. - Drugs. - No, I already brushed my teeth. - Are you on any medication? - No. - Are you self medicating with over-the-counter drugs? - Oh my god. - What? - You roll in here, late at night, looking hot as hell, tipsy, asking about my body. And you're still in doctor mode. - Are you self medicating with over-the-counter drugs? - You can't just barge into my house like this. I was doing an important project. - Some pain killers are antipyretic. Do you know what that means? - Yes. It means they're anti something. - It means they can lower your body temperature. - If you force fed someone a bunch of painkillers, you could freeze them to death? - No. That's just no. If you have been taking painkillers this whole time, it could affect our temperature checks. - Only if I'd just taken something right before you'd test me. - Antipyretic effects can last up to For hours after you've taken the drugs. - For hours? - Four hours. If you have been regularly taking painkillers, Jake, it could have compromised all our tests. I need to take you in. - Whoa. How are we supposed to keep this on the down low if you have an ambulance turn up? - That doesn't matter. - It does to me. I have busted my ass wrestling everywhere the last nine years and I have finally got a crack at a money gig in the states. - This magical job in the states? Get beat up here, get beat up in Sierra Leone. What is the lure of getting beat up in America? - The toy. - The what? - Look, this company is small, but they have a toy deal, okay? If I get signed, they make a Jake Ridge action figure. - Are you serious? A toy? You put your life at risk for a toy? - I wouldn't laugh at you if you wanted to win a Nobel Prize for medicine or something. - Yeah, don't compare what we do. - You're right. I pretend to be a bad guy to entertain people. You pretend to be a good guy and then you screw me over. - No one is screwing you over, Jake. This is for your health. - You can't take me in if I haven't been taking any pills. - You're not taking any pain killers? - That's what I'm telling you. - I'm coming back tomorrow morning for your checks. Do you understand what I'm saying? Tomorrow, more than four hours away. I need to take your temperature without any pain killers in your system. - Hm, I understand. You're saying you bailed on your date to come see me. Fuck, fuck, fuck! What's that? - I got you a phone, and steel wool. - How dirty is this phone? - Steel wool is for your mouse problem. Find where he's coming in and block it up. 37.3. - Told ya. - You're lucky. We're lucky. - Can I ask you a question? - I am not going to talk about my date last night. Yes I was drinking, I may have had one or two glasses of wine but me coming here was strictly a professional issue. - I have a professional question. Say if you use the toilet after me, there'd be no risk of transmission, right? - I've never used the bathroom here. - Theoretically though. - Is the toilet clean in this scenario? - And you're wearing gloves. - Why would I be wearing gloves? - You're working on the toilet. - In the unlikely event that I decide to take a look at your toilet, no, I cannot see that being a transmission risk. - I want you to keep that in mind when I tell you this next thing. Ooh, you bastard. - Who is that? - The plumber. The toilet wasn't working. - Do you realize what you've done? - You've just said there's no risk from the toilet. - No transmission risk. But the risk of breaching your confidentiality. I took a real risk for you last night, Jake, and you do this? - The bloke lives across the street. I yelled from the front yard. I haven't compromised anything. - Yeah? Who did you say I was? - Yeah. It seems like someone has tried to flush a bloody pharmacy down your crapper. You must be the girlfriend? - I'm his doctor. - Are you his girlfriend, or his doctor? - I'm both. - Oh, well true. I can see what's going on 'round here. - What's going on around here? - I reckon in the right hands, I can see some pretty nice coin with this info. - Patient confidentiality is a very important privilege. - You're bloody drug dealers. - Yes. - Yes. - Yeah, I thought so. So she brings you the drugs and you strip them down to make speed. And what happen if the coppers raid ya? - Yep. Yeah, that's exactly what happened. - Then I'm gonna need money for fixing the toilet, and double for fixing my mouth shut. - That's extortion. - But not extortionate. You know I had a journo around my place asking questions about some virus or something, and I kept his number. And I reckon he might be interested in hearing about a hero plumber that cracks a drug ring. - I'll be straight with ya. - Jake, no. - Have you heard of the antipyretic effect? - The what? - Drugs like these lower a person's temperature. Yeah. We had another smart mouth guy come after us recently, threatened the business. I follow him home, and I tune him up a little, you know. Put him down in a way that means he stays down. I figure that's enough of a warning. The doc, though? She is a fucking animal. She starts stuffin' pills in his mouth, saying she's gonna freeze him to death. Sick shit. This guy, he turns pale. His temperature drops, he's shaking. Oh, he's screaming at me. "Help me! "Help me!" And the doc says, the doc says. - I don't say anything. I'm busy working the blow torch. Yeah, the pills, they put him in a state of stasis. He couldn't even move, as I etched my name in third degree burns on his head. Oh, it's quite a thing to see a man mouth nothing as the air turns acrid and they stare into the eternal abyss of unending pain. - Listen, just forget what I said about the drugs. - You sure? 'Cause we've got a couple of pills back there left just for you. - No, I wanna go home. - You know that the science of that makes zero sense, right? - I expected you to back me up, not go full psycho. Flesh burning? - I read a lot of Stephen King. You lied. - He was trying to blackmail us. - Lied to me. You said you didn't take any pain killers. - I don't. Anymore. They all went down the toilet. - How many different drugs were you on? - You know when you go to the cinema, and you just want a small coke and the guy's like, "How about you get a popcorn as well? "It'll be cheaper." And you're like, "I'm not a fuckin' idiot, so yeah." And then he's like, "It's only 50 cents more for the large." - Suggestive selling. - Drug dealers who hang around indie wrestler's locker rooms are really good at suggestive selling. - Is that your secret? Is that why you're such a great wrestler? - I'm not a great wrestler. I'm just a guy who doesn't give a shit about getting hurt. - Then maybe you should start. 37.4. - That's up. - Mhm. It's higher than yesterday. Another threshold. - How's patient zero doing? - What is that? - It's this Japanese show that I did. Found it yesterday. - Come on Jake, we talked about this. - What? - The plumber was one thing but you can't, you can't have people delivering things. - How do you know I didn't already have this here? - 'Cause this isn't your house. You had no food. You're obviously wearing clothes that don't belong to you. There's mail addressed to a Steven Fairfield. You sleep here instead of the bedroom. - Why am I still here? - Because I made a decision that to move you would create more issues. Look, I can look the other way until we have you cleared, but you can't expose people by ordering stuff. Who brought you the DVD? - My dad. Your dad, he came here? - Was here. He died eight months ago. This is your dad's house? - His home. My house. He left it to me. This is the first time I've been back. - Okay. I'm sorry, Jake. He was into wrestling as well? - He hated it. When he found out I was training, he smacked me around. Whew. That's so good old Aussie dad logic for ya. "I don't want you hurtin' yourself son, "so I'm gonna bash you up instead." That's terrible. - He always hated wrestling but, mum dying really just pushed him off the deep end. I bailed at 16. Hadn't seen him since. - Why the DVD? - That's what I've been thinking about. This isn't just some Kmart checkout shit. This is like, Japanese import only. He wasn't exactly net savvy, the old man, so, the only place you could get a copy of that retail would be the Cavern. - What's the Cavern? - Right, you're not a sweaty 15-year-old, so you wouldn't know. The Cavern is this awesome, old school comic shop. They import wrestling DVDs, customized figurines. You know, if your guy has blue pants but you want them black, they'll modify them. - I think all the push ups deceived me. You're a huge nerd. - It's cool place. The old man was always dragging me out of there. I guess one time he went back. - Maybe it was his way of reaching out to you. Okay. - Maybe the reason he was against you wrestling was he was afraid of losing you like your mum. - And maybe you should just answer my fucking question. I asked you how the guy is doing in hospital. - I can't disclose his details, Jake, the same way I wouldn't tell someone else about you. - You said this thing has a 90 % fatality rate. Is he some kind of medical miracle? I can't-- - Why not? - Because his family doesn't even know. He's gone. - I could die. Jake. - See you tomorrow, doc. Primary school sports day. 35 degrees and there you are rocking a three piece suit. The other dads were in shorts. I pleaded with you to go home and change and you said, "When a man has something important to do, "he wears a suit." I hated you for that. Vowed to never wear a suit for anything. You know, all this time, I didn't know if you were just doing these things to mess with me. Maybe mum dying threw you for a loop. Maybe you were just worried about me all the time. Maybe I'm the prick. I was doing a show the night of your funeral. I should've come back. I was was, uh, my head was fucked. I said a prayer for you and then I went out and wrestled. I won that night. I never win. Never cared, to be honest, but, that night, I told them I was winning. Crowd full of kids, and the dirty dog bad guy picks up the W. That's why I'm gonna make it in the states. I don't give a fuck. Never had anything or anyone to give a fuck about. Except... This mouse. - About yesterday, I-- - It's fine. I've never really spoken to anyone about that before, so. - My mum was a professor. - Of course she was. - Not medical, she was English lit. - Is that why you like Shakespeare? No. I like Shakespeare 'cause he identifies universal truth. - What does your dad do? - My dad wasn't around. It was just mum and me and a rotating cast of post grad students and other lecturers. Everything was a debate and a discussion. There were no rules 'cause she didn't believe in that. - Sounds awful? - I'm not competing with you Jake. But she was troubled. You know, she would leave sometimes for days. I was nine the first time she just disappeared. I waited by the door all night. I didn't call anyone. I didn't move. She came back two days later, didn't explain, didn't say anything. By 11 I was used to it. And by 13, I looked forward to her being gone. - Fuck me. I bet you had some sick parties, though. - Hold still for a moment. Sometimes changes in the environment can affect the reading. I have to double check. - What does it say? - It could be an issue with the equipment. - What does it say? - 37.6. - That time? Both times. How do you feel? - Not great, now. - Okay, it's reset. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If it's high, I have the virus? - No, there's plenty of reasons for a high temperature. - Then let's wait and check again tomorrow. I don't feel that bad. - Algorithms don't work like that. If it's high, we move on to the next step. - Fuck the algorithm. Look at me. I have got through this because I am going to the states to wrestle. That's me winning. If you have to take me in, and the media finds out, I lose that opportunity. - If you have the virus, treatment at the hospital is the only option. - For the untreatable virus. - It's high, Jake. We need to get a sample of your blood so we can check for the virus. - Take it. - I can't do it like this. I need equipment. - You didn't bring a needle with you? - I need to get into more appropriate attire. - It's a blood test, doc. Don't feel like you have to slip into that slinky dress of yours. Oh. You're talking about outbreak style bright orange suit with radiation sign, right? - It's a simple suit, full face mask, there's no symbol on the exterior. - Oh. What color is it? - A fair shade of orange. - Classic zombie apocalypse. - This will probably be nothing. - It doesn't matter though, does it? You walking down the street in your full get up, there's no way the media doesn't find out. - My priority is public health, it's not your public image. - Oh. Wait. Can't you put the gear on inside? Yes. Just stash it in a bag, get changed here. - I can't. - What, you think I'm gonna perv on you? I'll go in the bathroom. - By the time I get back, you could be in such a state that just me coming inside unprotected puts me at risk. - Apologies if I twitch out any blood from my eyes onto you. - You need to calm down and focus on something else until I get back. - The skilled hunter prepares the bait. Symptomatic for a deadly virus and mere hours away from inevitable death, the hunter endures. For the hunter cannot rest until his foe has been defeated. He is conscious of his own mortality, but the hunter has made a sacred vow to catch his prey. But mainly, he just really, really, really hates that fucking mouse. I got you. You arrogant fuck. You thought you had it all figured out. The moves, the exits, the players. Your own little cocoon of sanctity runnin' around not giving a good fuck about anybody else. Don't look at me like that. You're stealing a life. You don't give a fuck about anyone, and no one gives a fuck about you. If I take you out, what is the difference? What is the difference if you die? And honestly, who would miss you? No one. Fucking no one. Subtle doc. Real subtle. How bad was it? - It's Halloween. I must've passed about a dozen people on the street. - A dozen? - I posed for some photos. - Photos? For the press? - Instagram. Everyone loved my "sick costume." Trick or treat. You're a genius. - Hm, hide in plain side. Plus, I never get to go out because of work. So it's kind of cool I get to say I went to a Halloween thing. Make a fist for me. You don't need to flex. - Oh, it's my Halloween costume. I'm going as a handsome buff guy. - Jake. - Ooh. This is my arms in their natural position. Wait. - Oh. Scared of needles? - I just wanna drag this out 'cause it's the closest we've ever been. Ow. - Mhm. Now it gets tested. Takes about eight hours for the assays. - Essays? - Assays. They compare your blood to different viruses, find a match, and then they retest it to make sure. - You do this? - Nope. Microbiologists. - But you drop the sample off? - Well, I have to. One person showing up in a hazmat, we can play off as a Halloween costume. But a medical courier turning up here? Uh uh, can't hide that. Someone should come back to monitor you until the results come in. - I'll be fine by myself. If you feel like medically you need to stay with me. - I'll come back. - One more thing. - Mhm? - Could you release him for me? - What happened to snapping its neck? - This chick I know wouldn't have liked that. - This is the oral will of Jesse Fairfield, who wrestled under the name, Jake Ridge. To my friend and brother, Panda, I leave my boots and tights. You have been my companion on this strange journey we've taken. I love you like a brother and I wish you every success. To charity, I leave my life savings. Which is about 45 bucks. Is that even worth it? To my friend and brother, Panda, I leave my boots and tights. I love you like a brother and I wish you every success. In return, I need you to hire me a lawyer to sell the house. To the lawyer, please sell the house, and give the money to charity. The cancer kids. Cancer Kids House. Is that a thing? Any charity is fine. Except those charities that use collectors outside the shops and stop you by saying something super casual like, "Hey big guy," or, "That's a cool shirt, mate." And you think you know them but you don't. They are pricks, and they get nothing. To Trudy. Or it might have been Clare. We hooked up in Byron Bay. You had brown hair. You said your pillow was super soft, I said, "Prove it." And you said, "Only if you promise to buy me breakfast." We did it twice, and then I snuck out in the morning before you woke up so I didn't have to pay for breakfast. God. To Trudy, or Clare. I leave 45 bucks, which should cover the pretty nice breakfast that I owe you. I don't have any contact details for you, so. Panda, boots, tights, yours, boom. Get me a lawyer. Lawyer, 'sup? Sell the house, 90 % to charity, and use the remainder to hire the detective to track down Trudy or Clare from Byron Bay. That's my will, do it! Are you sure it's okay? - It's no risk of our bodily fluids coming into contact at this distance. - It sucks the fun out of a date. I didn't know what you drank, so, cola, sparkling water, juice, and milk. - That's a waste, Jake. You're never gonna drink all that. - It's fine, doc. You can pour 'em on my grave to give me props. I'm sorry. - Or, mix 'em all for a cocktail called, "Fuck my credit card." That's one benefit of dying, I guess. Good bye debt. - Jake. - I can rob a bank and it wouldn't make a difference. Hell, I wouldn't even need a weapon. I could just threaten the teller with my virus ridden semen. Money in the bag or I'll get aroused. - Is that what you've been thinking about with all your time? - I've been thinking about everything. Do you believe in life after death? - Yeah. Some of the things I've seen, I'd like to believe that people are going somewhere better. - Yeah, I worked with a guy who had a theory. You see, Brad Hitt. - Pitt, Brad Pitt. - No, Hitt. Two T's. Kinda looked like, you know if ya squinted. His finish was the Ocean's 11 kicks to the back of the head. Yeah, indie wrestling, it's a weird world. Anyway. Brad Hitt had this theory about life flashing before your eyes when you die. - I don't wanna cause dispersions on the intellectual prowess of Brad Hitt, but that's not his theory. - He added a twist. See Brad reckoned that instead of flashing, your life takes places in real time. - So this, or now, is a flashback, you're dead. - Or you're dead, and I'm in your flashback. - So if this is a flashback, then we would know what's going to happen next. - Maybe it's like a dream. You're the one creating it, but you can still surprise yourself. - Hm. Tip of the hat to Brad Hitt, one of the greatest minds of the 21st century lost to spandex. Hm. - Don't do that. - What? - Everyone always goes to the spandex. Yes, wrestling is funny, it's super weird, but, it's not a joke. - It's fake. - Yeah, yeah, it's fake, it's phony, it's bullshit, and I was on enough painkillers to choke a toilet. - That's why I don't like it. Not 'cause it's a joke, 'cause it's not enough of a joke. Where's the fun in you getting hurt? - I can't get taller. I can't get faster. My only edge is that I am willing to go further than anyone else will. - Did you ever think that you might deserve something better? - This is gettin' a bit deep, doc. Let's stick to life after death. - I read this book once. Mhm. The author, he had a theory that hell was a cinema. - People talking, pricks using the light from their iPads to find their seats. - Hell is a cinema, and the audience is everyone you know. Friends, family, coworkers, lovers. - Coworkers before lovers. Interesting. - You sit in the middle row. - Good seat. Prime position for the surround sound. I'm rolling 300 deep with people I know. Not feeling very hellish. - Yeah, you haven't heard the movie. Your life. - My life? - Your life. Every single moment played out in real time, 40 feet high, for everyone you know to watch. - My greatest moments on the big screen. - It's not your greatest moments. It's all your moments. - Everything? - Mhm. In your case, a lot of uh uh, pew. - Oh god. Hell is someone I know watching me have a bat? - Mhm. - Do you remember that day with the "spiked heart rate?" - Oh my god. Why do you think I knocked that day instead of using the key? I could see you through the window on my way in. - What? - You were beating on that thing like it owed you money. Oh, oh, I can't be filthy too? I realized five minutes into meeting you, you use words to try and shock people and keep 'em at an arm's length. "Why don't you measure my cock?" - Oh, you don't do the exact same thing? "Um, epidemiologically the efficacy "of the pathogen, ugh." You could simplify that shit, but then, you couldn't keep people like me at a distance. - You're smarter than you let on. - And you're a better person than you even know. - You're sure? No, it's fine, I'm with him now. Oh fuck the algorithm. - You said fuck. - Yeah, you're a bad influence on me. - What did they say? - You need to bear in mind that they run two tests. It's the same way that we do with your temperature check. They run two to make sure that the first is accurate. - What did the first test say? - It was positive. Jake, look at me. It was positive but-- - It's okay. It's okay, doc. - We haven't run the confirmatory test yet. We don't even usually tell people on the first test but they told me and now I told you and now we have to wait four hours and... - Doc. Doc, please don't cry. I'd give you a hug if I didn't just test positive for a deadly virus. - How can you joke? - How can you not? You're not the one with the virus. - Because I, ugh, I'm being completely unprofessional. - If I've got four hours left, until you take me where I'll probably die, I don't wanna spend them with a professional. - What do you wanna do? - I wanna show you something that'll make you laugh. It's not my penis, I promise. "All the world's a stage and all the men and women "merely players. "They each have their exits, and their entrances. "And a man in his time plays many parts. "His acts being seven ages. "At first, "the infant. "Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. "And then, the whining school boy "with satchel and shining morning face. "Creeping like snail unwillingly to school. "And then "the lover. "Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad "made to his mistress' eyebrow.

Jakespeare, boom. - You memorized that for me? - Well, it's just been me, you, the books, and the mouse. I caught the mouse. My push up game is insane right now. And I got into some Shakespeare. - You're amazing. - Was amazing. Even if I do survive this thing, the media is gonna find me, and that's it for my trial. - I'm sorry. - All those push ups. - You get beat up. You don't get paid that well. You're on a regimen of painkillers just to operate. Come on, is it a bad thing that you miss out? - Why didn't you stop the first day we met? - Um, the first day we met was here. - No, it was at the hospital. I saw you leaving as I walked in. I said hi, and you just brushed me. - I didn't even. I'm in my own world when I come off shift. - You're in your own world, but you saw me. I know you did. Your eyes aren't the kind of eyes you easily forget. - Jake, I didn't know you then. - You knew what you saw. - I saw an angry, aggressive man bleeding and filthy. - You judged me. - I judged the situation. And when you're a woman alone in the city, that's a decision you can't get wrong. Later you called me a bitch and proved me right. - I was wrong. But maybe you weren't. - What does this got to do with wrestling? - I'm the freak who gets the shit kicked out of him for money. You're the doctors who dates other doctors who will probably have some very smart doctor kids. We're players. And those are our roles. Are you gonna answer it? - Yes? Are you sure? Positive? And you confirmed it? I'll tell the patient. - I got it doc. Jake, I am so sorry. - That'll be the ambulance. - Jake, it's-- - No. If I'm going out, I'm going out on my own two feet. - Hello mate, just here to install your internet. Your boy Barvinder from Toowoomba put a rush order on for ya. Now a bad time? - Wasn't the ambulance. - There's not going to be am ambulance, Jake. - The phone call, you said the second test was positive. - You don't have North African Respiratory Syndrome. That was negative. - What am I positive for? - The first test was a false positive where the result of another virus was misinterpreted. - Another virus? - You have leptospirosis. It causes flu like symptoms, nausea, temperature. It's nasty if it's not picked up, but a dose of antibiotics will sort you out. - I've been in here for 21 days. How did I catch something else? - I'm not an expert in lepto, but I do know it is known as rat catcher's disease. - Rat? As in mice? As in the mouse? - It comes from rodents, so people with a lot of contact with rats and wild mice, they're most at risk. Yeah, I, I should've got you that trap. This is your fault. - I didn't know it was gonna give you lepto. - But I'm okay? - Yeah. Gonna go to the lab and check in person. But Jake. You made it. - We made it. I couldn't have got through this without you. - No, I was just doing my job. - There's doing your job and then there's running out on a date, threatening a plumber with torture, and inspiring a wrestler to recite Shakespeare. - Jake. I-- - That'll be the internet guy. Media finally found me. - I need to get out of here and check your test. - Wait. What were you gonna say? - I'm really glad you're okay. They've been out there all night? - Shoving offers under the door. - Oh. I bought you something. - Oh. 1.8 meters, doc. - Are we dancing? - It's day 22. - You're officially done with your monitoring. - You didn't have to do that. - Yeah, I felt bad about the lepto thing and the media reporting, so, I bought you something. You going somewhere? - America. - But the media coverage, you said-- - Yeah, they saw the online coverage and loved it. I'm the man who survived the deadliest virus in the world. They offered me a guaranteed contract without try out. - But you didn't actually have the virus. - Yes, well, the guys who write the promos for these things aren't exactly sticklers for scientific accuracy. - You're going back to wrestling. - What else would I do? - How about literally anything else? - What's here for me? - If you have any further queries about your treatment, you can get in touch via the hospital. - What? Can I call you or something? - You should contact your GP if you have any questions in regards to your health. - Hi. - Nice suit. - When you've got something important to do, a man wears a suit. - I thought you had a flight to catch. - Yes. I wanted to check and epidemiological question. - You missed your flight to check an epidemiological question? - If an individual has finished a course of antibiotic treatment for leptospirosis, and comes into close contact with another individual, is there any risk of onward transmission? - None at all. - Good. - You're sticking around? - Ala Kefak.
