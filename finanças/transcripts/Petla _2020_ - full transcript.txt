- Congratulations. What's next? - I choose your station. And I - the Central Bureau of Investigations. Detectives' work is about obtaining information. Informers are our assets. To be a good detective, you must spend at least 8 years in the streets. - You want to take shortcuts. - I want something more. My son will walk every step of the way: blood, sweat, and tears. 39218, you have a call - a dead body. - Just don't look him in the eye. - What? They said in school, "Don't look a dead man in the eye." Remember not to look him in the eye. Problem solved... The gentleman has no head. That professor woman from number 20 is flooding my apartment. Come on. Oh, fuck! Wait! Oh, fuck. Fucking shit. What's your fucking problem? Can't a lady get fucking drunk anymore? Where's the blood from?! I cut myself on a glass at a vernissage. ...a motorcyclist crashed in the village. - What took you so long? - Save Kazik! - That's the paramedics' job. - Save him, - or I'll stab you with the pitchfork! - I'll check him out. - He can't be saved. - Resuscitate him! - Do it! - He's dead, you're dead. - Fucking resuscitate him! - Mouth to mouth, or I'll whack you! - Resuscitate him! Mouth to mouth! - Press harder! - Harder! - Harder! - Too fucking hard! - For fuck sake! Do it! - Fucking do it! - Fuck! - Faster! Wait. I'll approach him psychologically. Buddy! I have a train to catch at 2:30. Are you jumping, or not? 2:15, run for it! Think what your mother will think. Your girlfriend, or whoever you have? I have nobody. My green bike got stolen from outside the store today. I know who stole that bike. What time it happened. And where the bike is now. But as a fan of the "Father Mateusz" series, I wonder how you'll solve it. Hello. What's your disability? Dude, why are you so nitpicky? - You'll get fined. - Do you know who my father is? Your mother didn't tell you? - Take care of more serious things, beat. - The CID takes care of that, - and suckers like you by a beat like me. - Fucker! Fuck! Stop! Fuck. I need backup and EMS at the gas station at 12 Kruczkowskiego St. An officer down. Hurry up! Strap yourself to the pole. Tighter! Sir... Fucking clones. How many of you are here? - Calm down, sir. - One of you stabbed me! Don't know which. For me, the glass is half full, but it's empty for Zhenya. I'm Alex. Fucking awesome. Daniel. Danila. We're businessmen. Give me your price. - Fuck off. - I'll give you a terrorist, a Chechen. - He smuggles TNT to Europe. - Fucking bullshit. It's the truth. With us, you'll save the world. 50 kilos of TNT. A serious thing. You'll get promoted. And you won't be a beat. - Where's that terrorist? - He'll be in Rzeszow soon. Do we have a deal, Danila? - Leave us, Ania. - Don't worry, everything will be fine. - What about the twins? - They yanked the pole out and ran away. We caught them an hour ago. They're at the station. - Will you hand them over to me? - They're dangerous. They sold me a big thing. I'm off to the CBI in Rzeszow, - and I'll trade it for a job with them. - You still lack experience. - How about this? First blood. - It wasn't spilt in the line of duty. Okay. Then I'm not pressing charges. I cut myself with a knife. Son, there's a long way ahead of you. I'm leaving the station. I don't need you anymore. Release the twins. Give me my assets back. - You have 4 hours. - To do what? - To win my trust. - Why four? We're off to Rzeszow. RZESZOW Chief, Assistant Commissioner. - Daniel Sniezek. I had an appointment. - Come in. It's on. The officers of the CBI in Rzeszow have arrested 6 people in relation to the case of an organized crime group that manufactures illegal cigarettes. Huge success of the Subcarpathian law enforcement. - Now to the national news. - She cut out the rest. Cunt. - What do you have for me? - TNT. From Ukraine. 50 kilos. A sting operation with a Chechen terrorist. - What's that for? - To get a job with the CBI. I mean the TNT. A pile of brown poop. But it's a large amount. 50 kilos. It looks bad in the photos. I'm after a modern information strategy. It's the 21st century. Make it into a bomb. - A bomb? - Foiling a bomb attack. That's big. They'll write about us. Show us everywhere. You've got it, Danila. The Chechen is in town. We'll tell him to make a bomb. - You call a cell phone, and 'kaboom'. - Okay, see you later. - What the fuck was that? - He put a new phone on the bomb. They must've texted him a special offer. We failed to prevent the explosion, but let's be happy it was only 5 kilos. Let's grab the bull by the horns. We'll turn our failure into success. Make a bigger bomb. 45 kilos. Bring it to the town center. A terrorist from the Caucasus is hiding in the Subcarpathian voivodship. I'm close to catching him. Danila, for us a word is worth more than money. We'll make 45. Are you nuts? - That's a lot of people. - They're with us. Are they with you, too? - Is this 45 kilos? - Pure TNT. You set it off with this. Stop, police! - Stop, police! - Stop, police! Stop! Police! Okay. Step back. All right, I've got him! - Got it? - It didn't start. - The camera didn't start. - Why? - Something with the memory card. - Let's do a retake, chief. Let's film it again. I like you. Okay. A retake. - Lift him up. - Up! We're going back. - Back. - Get him here! - What's it all about? - Sit! - From the very beginning? - Yes, full throttle! - What do I do? - Shut up! - Rolling? - Action! - Stop, police! - Stop, police! - Police! - Get down! Down! - Got it? - Yes. Very well. Take a selfie of us! - Come here, Daniel. - Wait. Come. Okay. Now the bomb. - As if I took care of it. - We have a pyrotechnician here. Film it! - Guys! Split! A bomb! - Ninja! Let's scram! Get back. I'm here, chief' I'll handle it. - You made a fool out of yourself. - News tickers say otherwise. - You could've blown people up. - No risk, no glory. - Are you a pyrotechnician? - Please, meet... Assistant Commissioner Daniel Sniezek. Prosecutor Alicja Konarska. - You'll get charges. - For what? The Chechen claims you forced him to commit a crime, and the police made him make a bomb. What the fuck did you pull off? Think constructively, Alicja. It may be a huge success of the Rzeszow D.A. What if the terrorist intended to blow up a mall, and we saved a lot of lives? I've actually written it in my report. I'm sorry, but the Chechen won't corroborate your story, and you'll go down. What if he changes his mind? - Why would he? - I have a beneficial influence on people. If I go to jail, you'll do too. I'll withdraw my statement about you telling me to make a bomb, - if you do something for me. - Like what? You towed my car off to the police car park. Have it returned to my brothers. - How much cocaine was there? - 100 kilos. Do we have a deal? No, we don't. But I have something better for you. I got some pictures from the twins. Look. Your house. Your wife. Your daughter. Your son. And your dog that got killed. A real man will do anything to protect his family, right? Then cut the shit about the bomb. - Do you have a child? - No. I'll wait until you do. I'm from Chechnya. For what you did, back at home, we kill our enemy, his wife, and his child. You're not at home. It's a bargain. The guy's defaulting on his mortgage in Swiss francs. I'll let it to you for the value of my mortgage instalment. - The bedroom. The spacious living room. - I've an idea how to save money. We'll buy francs online. The instalment will be lower, and we'll - pay it directly to the bank. - How much can we save? Considering how much banks rip those franc debtors off, 6-8%. - What next? - I'll come to Warsaw for the weekend. Dirty laundry in Warsaw, clean stuff in Rzeszow? Hey. Shall I quit this job? - I can be myself here. - What about us? Move here. There's a tax office in Rzeszow too. And they're waiting to hire me? - Hello, Ania. Let's talk in my office. - Hello. - How did you do it? - Head of the tax office needs to fuck too, - and since he fucked in our brothel... - With us you'll get far. - Have you seen your desk? - No. Good. I don't want to see you there. In every other police department, a case comes to you. Someone gets killed, or mugged, and you solve it. In the CBI you find your case yourself. A case is a case if it's on TV. Otherwise, it means shit to me. Rzeszow has the highest number of brothels and churches per resident. - Do you go to church? - Yes. - How about a brothel? - No. Start, then. A brothel is a place where the worlds of crime, politics, agencies, and police meet. It's a cornucopia of knowledge, so get in your car, and go to a brothel. On your way there, roll your window down, and immerse yourself in the filth of those streets. And listen to what the city is telling you. Domestic call, a female needs help at 55 Sowinskiego Street. 36612, I'm nearby. I'll take it. Hi. Commissioner Sniezek. Did you call the police? - No. - Can I look inside? What happened here? - Nothing. - Nothing? What's this? Roll up your sleeve. Roll it up! Take it off. Strip! How did it happen? Fucking shit. One of our whores. Her name was Tania. Why "was"? She's alive. She's dead for our business. Who did it to her? - Englishman. - Who? A psycho. He got out of jail in England. He likes manhandling people. He's taking over brothels in Subcarpathia. Has he visited the owner of your brothel yet? - No. Heniek would've told us. - I want to talk to Heniek then. Hi, honey, shall we have a drink? I can't afford it. I earn 3,800 a month. - Do you work at the till? - CBI. - Danila is here. - Svetlana, wait, I must take a leak. Take over, brother. I'm done, honey. Heniek, you have a visitor. A guardian angel, they say. - What can I do for you? - I was about to ask the same. - Do you know her? - It's hard to tell in this condition. I can rid you of your problems. - How? - Sell the club. To whom? To him, the Englishman, when he comes here. - I set it all up and record it. - Sting operation? You'll have peace, and I'll have him. I don't work with law enforcement. Police! What the fuck's going on here? Look at this madness, Henryk. Sodom and Gomorrah. You've lost control over it. Time to retire. Retired. If I can't convince you, maybe my girl will. Englishman! We've got a po-po here. What are you doing in a place like this? Shame, shame. Fuck! Are you out of your fucking minds? You came to fuck whores, now a whore will fuck you. Fuck! Are you fucking nuts? Which end do you prefer? It doesn't matter? - I had a panic attack. Are you good, too? - As you can see. How's Heniek? He'd sooner set the club on fire than let the Englishman have it. Danila, we must help Heniek. How? Stop, or I'll shoot! - Are you nuts? - I gave a warning. Police! Heniek, I understand personal use, but such an amount? What is it? It's not mine. Is it your wife's? What the fuck do you want, man? Let's talk. Do you know what kesagake is? You cut the guy open from the shoulder down to the waist. Learn, little viper. You'll have a husband one day. Crazy Americans, singing a song about phimosis. - Take the pooch. - What for? - Stuff it, and hang its head on the wall. - Great idea. The kids shouldn't see it. Can I ask you something? Why did you kill it? - There's a competition in our department. - Really? Who'll whack the most dogs. I'm on the lead for now. - Congratulations. - Thanks. I'll go and get it. - All that noise browbeat the kids. - Did what? Browbeat. I'm fucking starving. Want some? They make awesome food now. If there was more meat than sauce though, cheating cunts. - Fuck, you have an S-Class? - Yes. You'll have to get the camshaft done at 200,000. You'll sell the club to the Englishman, and I'll bust him. - I see you really care? - Let's say it's a personal matter. - What about the drugs? - What drugs? Fucking drugs! Cocaine. Your men saw it. We need hard evidence, and there's nothing there for now. - And the prosecutor guy? - Woman. - Sniezek. - Hi. May I come in? - Since when are we friends? - Since now. May I come in? - To my husband and kids? - You have neither. - You drink wine at this time. - How do you know? - Detective work. - I'm so scared. No need to when I'm around. - You want me to believe it's sugar. - For the sake of the investigation. You'll get the Englishman and his crew in return. Maybe, you'll get back to Warsaw thanks to me. I know you were dismissed on disciplinary grounds there. - Wouldn't you like to go back? - You're a tough cookie. Very self-confident. Because you're good at covering your tracks. Like with that bomb. - Are you blackmailing me, son? - You? No, mommy. - Do you have a wife? - Yes. Are you cheating on her? No. What kind of question is that? - An offer, perhaps. - Have a nice evening. - What is it? - A gift. We'll have a baby. I'm 3 months pregnant. - What is it? - Sound check. Fuck off. Someone from the Englishman. Chairman's waiting. - Elzbieta Nowak, nice to see you. - It's not nice. Where's the money? I've signed both. Please, sign here... and here... - Can I read it first? - And send in your corrections? - There's no mention of the Englishman. - I'll be the owner. You? And who the fuck are you? A front? The Englishman has no balls, and sends a broad here. - Are you signing? - What if I don't? - You'll deal with the Englishman. - What's he doing? Thinks he's a movie star. Now get packed and get the fuck out. We're going in. On the ground! Hands up! On the ground! Give up! I'm fucking giving up! How are you going to cuff her now? What was it? Combat stress! - We've been here for 4 hours. - Are you bored? - No, but? - But what? - You're not asking me about anything. - Okay. A flirtatious woman, 8 letters, starts with "c"? - Cunt. - 8 letters? - I don't know. - You're free, then. "Coquette", get up. - Do you have a husband? - No. - Kids? - No. - Good. - Why? No one will cry after you. Snitch. Rat. - What now? - They'll get rid of the witness who sold them, - so we can't use his testimony in court. - Record it. How shall we justify our not preventing the murder? - What were you doing there for 4 hours? - We were doing crosswords. - Can I go boss? I'll knock them out. - Wait. - Bury her. - She's still alive. Do it. - How much longer? - 2 minutes until she chokes to death. Let's get our stories straight. I was standing here, you there. Fucking hands! Show me your hands! - Got any guns? - I do. - And you? - I do, too. Hit him. - I'll shoot. - Shoot. Show your hands! Ninja, he's dead. Bye-bye, Paragon. That's how thugs end in my town. I wanted bangers, not stiffs. - The Englishman is alive. - Paralyzed. - He'll do time in a wheelchair. - Pick it up, maybe it's your wife? - We may not come off this corner. - We already have. Really? Was it the first time... when you've shot a man? Do you have a headache? Maybe you need a shrink? No. I have you. All your life on your back? That's fucked up. Your friend Anal Ninja is here, and has little something to probe you. I wish you a long life. - Am I safe now? - It depends. On what? On your cooperation. - I'm no snitch. - Is it yes, or no? Fuck off. Chest forward, Halina, get yourself in motion. Yes, good. See? Smile. - Heniek. - What? Cheers! I'll show you something, Heniek. So what? It's a brothel. My wife knows I fuck other broads. A prosecutor will have a look at that. Fucking is not illegal, and the prosecutor fucked here too. True, but Nadia... look... she's only 15. You'll get busted for pedophilia. Do you get it now? I think our beautiful club was a second home for you. Enough, or you'll make us cry. Fuck off. Hey, girls, for Heniek. His favorite dumka. To luck, Heniek! We must get rid of all the pimps in Subcarpathia. Once we hit the biggest one, the rest will step down on their own. We'll have a monopoly. The strongest one is Gypsy, a boxer. He has a chain of brothels. He has a team of Chechens, friends of the one you busted. Gypsy's already got an issue with us for spoiling his market. Mr. Kostecki? - Do you want my autograph? - Under your testimony. - Are you fucking accusing me? - People are complaining you're scaring them, because they spoil your market. Scaring is what ghosts do. Did the Russian clones send you? - They're untouchable. - Tell them they can kiss my ass. Should they rip it open too? Real men enter the ring, pussies stay out if it. Unless they have 9 mm, and the permission to whack you. Fuck you, fucking piece of shit. - Bust the door and everything you can. - Even if it's open? - Storm in like locusts. Any questions? - What's locusts? Oh? 180 decibels is 180 decibels. What the fuck? Police! Get down! Our best boxer before his fight for the championship belt with Roy Jones Junior! You can't bust Gypsy for nothing! - He owns a chain of brothels. - Can you prove it? He's broken. I'll squeeze it out of him. No, you won't. I'm releasing him. - Chief! - Him, or you. Get out. - Apologize. - What? - Apologize, and I'll forgive you. - I'll obliterate you, before you do. See you, champ. - Sorry I'm late. - Our class has just ended. See you next week, guys. I'm sorry, honey, I had work. Ania... Ania... Ania? Ania, dear. What's with her? Superficial injuries. She'll be fine, but... But what? Your wife has miscarried. What? Ania... Gypsy! Where the fuck is Gypsy? Fucking Gypsy! Oh, Daniel! You've lost your piece. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid of you. Have I told you that? I'm only afraid of 3 people in my life. The first one's Chuck Norris, then Marcin Najman. And my dear wifey. Now you're the fourth one. You're on this prestigious list. You're a champ, bro. I won't fight with you. Fuck! I'll fuck you up! Go ahead. I'm not fighting. - Go ahead. - Fuck. And you're down. It's a pity only your baby was killed. Don't worry, though. For what you did to our brother, we'll get you and your wife. Why? Tell me why. Why? Who did it? Who killed my child? - Give it back. - No. - Give me the bottle. - No, no! You can't drink. What can you do?! Punch people on the face? You can't even protect us! Danila, get up. Alex made you some breakfast. Fuck off. We eat, work, and rejoice together, and pay together, like a family. And we'll get Gypsy and the Chechens for what they did. - How? - We'll set them up for you, Danila. UKRAINE BORDER CROSSING POINT MEDYKA-SZEGINIE - How many sleeping beauties? - Nine. - One thousand bucks per piece. - I know. Start counting. Hey, you! - What the fuck is going on here? - I don't know, bro. - What's going on? - Go home! You heard me. What is it? Fuck me. - Police! - What the fuck? - On the ground! - Fuck the snitches! You're detained for the abduction of 9 Ukrainian females and human trafficking! - If they're dead, I'll add up charges. - We should've killed you, asshole. Too late. We got an anonymous phone call. There was a risk the girls were dead. I had to take action. I'm sorry. Okay. What will I tell the media? Give them some colorful details. Gale-force wind was blowing. The world was shrouded in darkness. When I found the van, I felt a lump in my throat. Inside were dead female bodies. Their killer was standing over them. Dawid Kostecki, a.k.a. Gypsy. At that very moment, I remembered what my father used to say about how a real man should handle such a situation. I pulled out a gun... And... I said, "Freeze, police." It's not enough to put a thug in a slammer. He has to be destroyed totally, deprived of... money, friends, family, children, and home. Everything. Gypsy loves his woman so much that it makes him beat her up - and the kid too. - He's jealous of her. That's his soft spot. Hi. Wanna race? It's not going to work. - I'll bet you a bottle of champagne? - Bug off. By the way, I'm Daniel. Great. Daniel Sniezek. You fucking scumbag! You locked my man up! Motherfucker! A motherfucker is the one who did it to you. He slapped me. And raped me like he did the others. A month later I found out I was pregnant. - What happened with the baby? - He told her to have an abortion. Why are you showing me this? That scum doesn't deserve you. Are you any better? Yes. I'll never hit you. By the way, he won't either. I want to protect you and your child. No... Look. You smell of women's perfume. Action in the brothel. Hookers use liters of perfume. You're the whole world to me, you know? Gypsy is in the Zaleze prison. I know the warden there. I'll invite him over to a party here. Get him hot chicks, and record him fucking in the room. - The broads recorded you fucking. - I'll get kicked out. The twins will try to help you. But they need help, too. Gypsy, your woman's here to see you. Hey, don't be afraid. I'm with you, everything will be fine. We'll walk through it together. I love you. Ruta? What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? For fuck sake, Ruta?! - I don't give a fuck about you. - Really?! Really! Let me show you, faggot! - What the fuck? - For what you did, I'll suck his dick! What the fuck are you doing? Ruta, fuck, I can't... You fucking whore! Slut! Fucking cocksucker! I'll get you for it! You fucking cunt! I'll kill you, slut! I'll kill you, slut! I will fucking kill you! I'll kill you, whore! Think about our fucking son! Oh, yes! You like it! She likes it when I deepthroat her. You whore! Fuck off! Do you want to kiss her goodbye? We won't see each other again. What do you have for me? I want to get out. - That's an ambitious plan. - I'll give you customs officers, po-pos, politicians. Bangers. - I want the crown. - Excuse me? I can be your crown witness. We'll talk at the same place as before, not on the phone. - Gypsy can't leave the prison! - It's up to the court to decide. - On your motion. - I've been pressed. - By whom? - The society. Everyone wants to see his fight with Roy Jones. What if I ask you nicely? Detainment for sex? - Maybe... - Wow... - What if I want more? - For example? - I don't like competition. - I have a wife. - I used to have a husband too. - It's not that simple. - Nothing in life is simple. Take the risk. - So there's no deal? No. But one thing is certain. In the end, we'll screw like animals. So, do you want those recordings, Czesio? Show me how much you do. Gypsy is selling his business partners... - Told the prosecutor about us. - You know what to do? Mom... Guard! Help! He hanged himself! What a tragedy. Take them away. Dawid Kostecki committed suicide in the remand prison. He hanged himself on a sheet, while lying under a blanket in his bed. Was Kostecki aggressive before his death? - He was acting like a madman. - Warden? The autopsy unequivocally indicates that Dawid Kostecki's died from the strangulation of the noose he had put around his neck. I've just learnt about it. I'm so sorry. Come to see me right away! I've made myself comfortable. You screwed me! - Not yet. But I'm getting to like you. - Fuck you! Damn, I got a boner. Gypsy got whacked, you fucking necrophile. - If you live by the sword... - Or, "Is fecit, cui prodest." So now we're speaking Latin? I prefer French. "The one who gained from it, did it." And you gained from his death. What are you accusing me of? I'm no fool. Beware, Sniezek, I have access to the files. I watch and listen to people, and you're no angel. You're no angel, either. That's why we're a perfect match. - What are you doing? - For evidentiary purposes. If you piss me off, I'll send it to your wife. You're a genius, Alicja. Hi. I'm pregnant. I love you. We'll open an exclusive brothel. A place for politicians, business people, public officials, and celebrities. Discretion guaranteed, top-class broads. We'll mount cameras in the rooms, gather stuff on people, and then blackmail them. People who have power, money, and fame don't want to fuck hookers, but regular girls. That's why we won't employ whores, but dancers who'll dance Swan Lake. And have sex with you for a specific amount of cash. So that you feel special. Do you have an idea what to call this club? "Imperium". We'll find dancers willing to fuck over the eastern border. - It's our land. We can build palaces here. - How do we pay for them? Yes. We must go back to the club. - Who the fuck is it? - A bartender. - Okay, so? - He said he was with the SBU. - What? -He's been sent by the Security Service of Ukraine. They know what we're up to and want to talk. - So when are you going? - No, we're too small. - The SBU wants to talk to you. - See you in Lvov. LVOV I'm looking for a parking spot. I'm here to see colonel Egia Voronin. Get out of the car. I'll park it. Come in, please. Take out all your stuff: pens, documents, memory sticks. Coffee, tea, or maybe cognac? How about Vera? She's great at fucking. As you say, "A blow to break the ice." Cognac will do. - Egia. - Daniel. What do you want? We're living in a global village, understand? Girls from my country go to your country to fuck. I need to get my cut of the profit. It's obvious. It's exportation. Let's drink to friendship. - Do you want money? - Money can ruin every friendship. - And it has no value for me. - What does? You're in Europe. I've heard 2 million dollars will buy you any act in your country. I'd buy a couple. - Why? - What do you mean "why"? To regulate foreign trade between our countries. - What am I supposed to do? - Whatever you've been doing. Have fun. Attract powerful people to "Imperium". Put up a shield over the twins, look after them. The brothers must be untouchable. It is crucial. And one day, when I call you, you'll give me someone who's fucked in your club. - There's no "Imperium" yet. - That's why we're talking about it now. I'll help you build your "Imperium". - How? - In the Chechen's car in the police parking lot, you'll find 100 kilos of cocaine. - How do you know that? - It's irrelevant. I will help you sell it here in Ukraine. - With an ample margin. - How will I bring it here? Organize a trip for Polish officials, judges, prosecutors, police officers. Bring them all to Lvov under the guise of a sightseeing tour. You'll carry the cocaine in the minibus. No one will search you at the border. They won't dare to check high ranking state officials. I'll protect you on the Ukrainian side. The officials will get to see Lvov. You'll sell the cocaine there. You'll earn a fortune. And will use it in Poland to build your "Imperium". What if I refuse? You don't fucking get it, Danila. Then the Polish law enforcement will receive your files from Ukraine. - What files? - On human trafficking. Your dancers come to Poland. They have no visas. They must return to Ukraine every 3 months. I'll detain and interrogate them here, and force to confess, because they'll be afraid that we'll tell their families they work as whores in Poland. I'll obtain testimonies against you, the brothers? And frankly speaking... I already have them. These are the testimonies against you. You have testimonies of the girls I haven't even brought to Poland yet? That's my job. It sounds like a pact with the Devil. Because I am the Devil. Is this a whore party, or something? I want a blowjob. - Which one's ready to suck my dick? - Mirek, they're famous Bolshoi dancers. They are here to perform. - Fuck off with that BJ shit. - Scram, you're causing a draft. Danila, the main course. You'll like it. Welcome to Poland. All Ukrainians. The building of "Imperium" is in full swing! Look at this pretty girlie. Write out two arrest warrants for me. Can I come first? Zhenya feels like a film director. He's like Steven Spielberg. - Synchronization! - It was synced. Awesome. I'd fuck them all. Danila, I tried to test the dancers, but they say Polish guys can't fuck. Save their honor and show them how it's done. Creme de la creme. Let's ride the chariots of clones. What? - Stay calm. The manager wrecked your car. - Fuck! I'll fucking kill him! Fucker! I'll fuck you up! There are two types of hattrick. Classic, and non-classic. A classic one is when I fuck three chicks on one day. A non-classic is when I fuck two of them, and my wife. - You can't be defeated, can you? - Tap the mat. - What? - Like an MMA fighter, tap the mat 3 times. Okay. Get me another one. - My name's Svetlana. - Come here. Spread your legs. Okay. - Ouch, not in the butt! - Shut up! I don't want that! I'm here for the warrant. I must fuck one banger up. Why don't you fuck me first? - Has your wife drained you? - Fuck off my wife. What's this stench? I may have shit on my cock, and in my pants. - Whose ass did you fuck without a rubber? - Not your fucking business. - Excuse me? - Excuse yourself, whore. No more fucking, fuck off. You're boring me. I have a bevy of other sluts. Will you issue that warrant for me? What do you want from me? You're fucking other chicks. I told you I hated competition. But you were too sensitive to dump your wife. And now you're fucking bitches up the ass, and come here with shit on your dick. So who am I to you? Will you issue the warrant, or not? No fucking way. Get the fuck out. Daniel... I'll destroy you. Try. Very well. I'll kill you, bitch. I'll fuck you up, bitch! I'll fuck you up, understand? - Are you feeling well, Zhenya? - Danila, I'm a visionary. Let's shoot, girls! Keep the bag over your head, whore. - What's your name? - Dick. - Why Dick? - After my mother, "Dick sucker". - Let's go. - Why? Because he's here. Which one is him? That one... We're not leaving. Show your balls. Hi! - I'm Daniel. - Kasia. - You owe me a drink. - Why? Because I dropped mine when I saw you. - Come. - Where? I've fallen in love with you, and I won't let you go. Dad... It's just a dream, come. But you know I'm a cop? Fuck that, I'll get used to it. - And you? - I'm a lawyer with DI Arizon. What's that? The biggest law firm in the world. We're in 115 countries. I can use you. Dad, I had a dream about some dad visiting mom. What? Zhenya's gone crazy. He bought a gondola and teaches whores to boat. Move it! Harder! You're holding an oar, not a dick! I'm pregnant. Why is it a problem? You have a husband. But I haven't fucked him for 6 months. Okay, I'll get you an abortion. LVOV I'll buy you something nice. Take care. Thanks for the surgery. Friends give friends presents, right? Vera will show you around Lvov. - See you, Danila. - Bye. Do you prefer a disco, or a museum? - What's this? - Gifts. One for the mistress. Another one for the wife. Lovely. - A camera in the TV's diode. - Three in each room. Undetectable. The server room's accessible to you only. No one gets in without your fingerprint. Every night, you upload the recordings to your memory stick. I need to buy an apartment, but no one should know it's mine. I'll arrange it for you through England. - How? - We'll set up a business for 200 pounds, and it'll buy you a flat. In England if you don't deal in arms, or drugs, the law firm won't reveal who owns the business that bought the apartment. Ladies and gentlemen! I hereby declare "Imperium" Club as open. This is what I call an opening! Tanya went to the room with a famous plastic surgeon that operates on celebrities. My tits got pretty saggy after the pregnancy. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. - But I want to have them done. - You don't have to do it for me. You can do it for yourself, if you want. Look. What do you want for that? You'll start by doing my wife's boobs. Wow. Now they must be tested at home. - Chest out... - I must be careful with the stitches. I'll be gentle... - What's this? - They popped! - You did shitty job on my wife. - What is it? You botched it! You'll do it again! I have something big on the bishop. Any ideas how to use it? Priests own a lot of land. Have him bequeath some to you. So what? Are you fucking nuts? You keep her photo on your desk? Have you fallen in love? Fuck you, that's your problem. You'll sign all your plots along the highway over to me. He's a big politician. He ordered a 14-year-old, so he got one. You want to fuck kids? 14-year-old?! You fucking perv! Let him get us a building permit by the highway. You'll sell it to a shopping mall. Room No: 3, he's the head of the tax office. - If we have an inspection, you'll help us. - The tax office in Kruczkowskiego St? - Yes. - Great. He's my wife's boss. The position of a vice-head has become vacant. I thought I'd get this job, but my new boss prefers his lackey. I should get that job. I'm objectively better, but no one has my back. Now call my wife, and congratulate her on her promotion. I'm so proud of you, sweetie. Congratulations. That hotshot businessman's assets in Subcarpathia amount to 400 million. What do you want in exchange? Give me 10 million, plus this house. - Beat my meat. - What? My first name's Beat, last name: My-meat. A famous Czech writer. Ninja, go fuck her, please. I can't look at her. Fucking go. Ninja! Ninja! Not with the sword! Drink, slut! Drink it, slut! Daniel, fuck. Danila, rescue kit. Give me that. Ahoy! You fucked her good. Look how happy she is. Finger up her ass works miracles. Do I have to drown you, whore, to get a boner? Fuck you, here's for good luck! Ouch, boss... Party's over! Get the fuck out! Gentlemen, are you aware we'll never have to work again? I'll tax everyone. It's my pleasure to inform you that Commissioner Daniel Sniezek has become the new head of the Fraud Squad. Your blood pressure must've gone up, Daniel. We'll fix it. Now it's good... There you go. Let's continue. The newest productions don't click well on the Internet. Tell the thugs to do more spectacular things. I've obtained some money and want to buy the apartment that we're renting. That's it, fuck. I'm paying that fucking franc loan off to you. Let's count, Halina. Advertising is the key, and we must fight for clients. So we'll take part in a talent show. We must look awesome on TV, so you'll do a boob job for all the girls. A liter per tit, got it? What the fuck are you doing? You know shit! Relax. You've filed a report about being blackmailed by Officer Sniezek. I did one pair of boobs, then another, then 15, but it doesn't end. - What does he blackmail you with? - He filmed me fucking in the brothel. He used a hidden camera. Which brothel? I want license plates of all the cars that stopped there over the last year. And the owners' details. What do I owe this unexpected invitation to? Father Bishop, I have a question for you. Has Officer Daniel Sniezek ever blackmailed you with a sex tape? He had a video of your sex with a dancer at "lmperium"? Did he threaten to use it to destroy you? What did you give him in exchange? I have the feeling there's bad blood between us because of Daniel. Can I make a cup of coffee? I was writing a summons all night. I'm exhausted. We haven't met to eat fucking cookies. I'm summoning you as a witness. A witness is obligated to tell the truth, and mustn't hold it back. A witness that makes a false testimony, or holds back the truth, will be subject to criminal prosecution, and face up to 3 years of imprisonment. CRACOW You understand why I can't turn to the CBI in Rzeszow. One of the commanding officers in Rzeszow used the CBI to get rid of pimps in Subcarpathia, and opened his own brothel. It's a case for the Central Anticorruption Bureau. State officials have been corrupted. I've notified the DHS - mass blackmailing of state officials has an impact on the state. Politicians've been filmed at "Imperium." It may influence the results of the elections. General, it's a matter for the counter-espionage. The police officer contacted foreign intelligence. Central Bureau of Investigations! - CBA. What are you doing here? - Taking in a suspect, and you? - Who said that? - Department of Homeland Security. - What's going on? - Military counter-intelligence. It's our case. Prosecutor Alicja Konarska. You'll have to reach a fucking agreement. Sniezek, where's everyone? Where are the dancers? And the brothers? Fuck! Where are tonight's recordings? How do you turn it off? Bust it. Open up! Will you enter the code? Cut it. Where are the recordings? If you can't prove those recordings exist, they'll rip your head off. - I'll cut him loose. - You're joking. He's useless in jail, but outside he can lead us to the sex tapes. I'm coming for you. All the agencies are after you: CBI, CBA, DHS and MCS. Once you're out that door, you'll be like an earthworm on an expressway. - You can be certain you'll get run over. - Why are you doing this? For love. Your police ID. Weapon. You're banned from the CBI buildings. Daniel. I was at your show too. I know. So what? Nothing, I hope, because I'm gay. Hi. - Ninja, don't you recognize me? - Go away, I don't know you. I don't know him. Never seen him before. LVOV There was the HQ of the Security Service of Ukraine here. - Where is it now? - It's never been here. This building's been abandoned for ages. What are you doing? Checking if they've come for me. - Who? - Agents always come at six. - Why are you whispering? - The whole place is tapped. Clear. Will you calm down now? THEY'VE UPLOADED PEGASUS TO MY PHONE, THEY LISTEN AND WATCH US. DON'T TRUST ANYONE. Daniel. Your biggest enemy is yourself. I'll set his wife up with an agent that'll turn her against her husband. How? Do you know how to boil a turtle? You turn the temperature up slowly, until it misses the moment when it starts to boil. Women get addicted to emotions. When the agent seduces her, soon she'll do everything for him. We've created her psychological profile, and we'll set her up with a guy she needs. We'll give her a man that'll make her feel safe. And then he'll persuade her to commit a crime. Asia, are you okay? - What have you done, bitch? - You were the one tailgating. Put it away! Is there a problem? - Fuck off. - Excuse me? - How are you feeling? - Just a headache. Whiplash injury. You should have your cervical vertebrae X-rayed. - I'm alone with the child. - I'll drive you to the hospital. And my employee will change the wheel and bring us the car. - I'm Marek. - Ania. - Relax, take the child. Everything will be fine. He's gone. - Weren't you afraid? - My job is about safety. - Do you practice something? - Krav Maga, aikido, jujitsu. I run trainings for companies: what to do in critical situations. I'd love to stop being afraid. I can teach you? We had an accident. I've been calling you for 3 hours! Can you hear me? I attack you. Move your foot back. Fingers in the eyes. Hard. Joint lock on the neck. Now hit the face and kick. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry... I'm sorry. - You may go for the groin, if you want. - Damn, if you really wanted to hurt me, like drag me somewhere and rape me, I wouldn't be able to defend myself. Imagine I really wanted to rape you. And dragged you somewhere. Then... I would turn back. Tough luck... I'll have breakfast alone. What are you doing? I'M WATCHING OUR HOUSE SO THAT THEY DON'T PLANT ANYTHING ON US. OUR HOUSE? YOU'RE LIVING IN YOUR OWN WORLD. NOTHING'S OURS ANY MORE. WE HAVE A DAUGHTER. THAT'S ALL THAT CONNECTS US. I WANT YOU TO LOVE ME. I DO. I CAN'T FEEL IT. You grab his hand with your hand. With the other hand, with your fingers, you push his Adam's apple in. Hard. Now you put your legs, shank first... the your foot around his hip... Very well. You create a space for the kick. Push him off, and kick! Are you all right? You were supposed to run. I'll wait until you want it. Your level of suspiciousness will soon make you delusional. You must take schizophrenia medications, but in small doses. - Hello. - Something terrible happened. I'm outside your office. Come out immediately. - What happened? - Something terrible. Come out. I just had to see you. You're nuts! You're becoming for my heart what water is for the well. Have a wonderful day. I've gotten addicted to you, so I need a bigger dose. Find someone to look after Asia, put a tracksuit on, grab a backpack, because we're off to the countryside. Is that how you're going to the countryside? I was joking. I'm taking you for a romantic weekend in Paris. Fuck, all pimped up himself, and I'm supposed to walk on Champs Elysees in a tracksuit? Come and stop nagging. - I broke a mirror. - What? Come and see. Hello? How come they've withheld the VAT? By what law? Fucking hell! Okay. See you. - What is it? - They'd withheld - 6 million of my VAT return. - On what grounds? None. I ran trainings for Dutch banks. I applied for VAT return, but the tax office put it on hold. If they block it, I'll have to declare bankruptcy. - Which tax office? - The second. It's mine. - They did block it. - I'm no thief. - I'll pass that VAT for you. - Really? - But isn't it...? - A crime? - Yes. - Don't do that. I haven't done a lot of things. I haven't been to Paris, practiced martial arts, cheated on my husband, or felt what I'm feeling for you. You too? So if I'm to change my life, I'll start with the VAT. CAB! You're detained on suspicion of committing tax fraud... We'll lock you and your husband up, and your daughter will end up at Child Services. I'll have your parental rights revoked. It'll be months before the grandfather will get the custody of the child, and she will develop PTSD. But you may stop this nightmare. If you sign it. - What's this? - A testimony incriminating your husband that states you've seen sex tapes from the brothel your husband used to blackmail people in this list. You'll get the status of a crown witness. Your testimony in court will be more credible, as you'll be cooperating with the law enforcement. And I'll let you go back to your child. What about Daniel? - He'll go to jail. - But he's unwell. You have a minute to make your decision. It's a one-time offer. I won't make it again. 30 seconds. You don't really want to save your child, do you? Do I still give you a boner? We could meet in the wet room. Your wife set you up. She filed for divorce, and revocation of parental rights. You're a threat to yourself, but don't worry, I'll save you. You'll be safe in jail. By the way, if you should remember where the tapes are, call me. A psychologist to see you. Are you going to hang yourself? One man had two sons. The younger one said to his father, "Give me my share of the property." So the father divided the property between his two sons. Then the younger son gathered up all that was his and left. He traveled far away to another country. There he wasted his money in foolish living. When he spent everything he had, there was nothing to eat in the country. He was hungry and needed money. So he got a job with one of the citizens there. The man sent him into the fields to feed pigs. He was willing to eat the food the pigs were eating. But no one gave him anything. Then he thought and said, "All my father's servants have plenty of food, and I'm dying with hunger here." I'll return to my father and say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God, and against you. I'm not good enough to be called your son." This is a word for you, Daniel. Our Father, who art in heaven... Will anybody visit you on Christmas Eve? Dad... it's me, Daniel. I have sinned, dad... I have sinned a lot... I'm no longer your son... Give him the clothes I've brought, and the shoes. Bring the food for Christmas Eve dinner. Your recordings have been taken over by the Russian military intelligence. The Russians recruited you months ago. You didn't recruit the twins at the gas station. They recruited you. Alex and Zhenya are GRU agents. So were the dancers at "Imperium". And the Security Service in Lvov. They posed as Ukrainians and manipulated you. They stole the sex tapes to control the political situation in Poland before the elections. Dad... I just want to see my daughter. I've served you for years, I've never broken any orders, but you've never made me such dinner. He squandered everything on whores, but you give him clothes, rings, - and arrange Christmas dinner for him. - Son... you've always stood by my side. Everything I have is yours. And now let's rejoice that your brother, who was dead, is alive. He got lost, but he's found his way. Daniel Sniezek converted in jail. An expert team of sexologists and psychiatrists led by Prof. Lew-Starowicz diagnosed him with sex addiction and narcissism. He went back to his wife after he'd left prison. He took up security in business. Dawid "Gypsy" Kostecki's family members don't believe in his suicide and continue their efforts to establish the circumstances of his death. Alex and Zhenya are still in Poland. They have confirmed that the Russian special services tried to recruit them. They maintain that no sex tapes have ever been recorded in their club. They have opened a new chain of night clubs. Multiple investigations into the "Subcarpathian sex tape scandal" are currently in progress.
