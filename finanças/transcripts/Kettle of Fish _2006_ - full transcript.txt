[music playing] Have I been here before? MEL (VOICEOVER): Let's face it. You lead a pretty good life. I want to play you like a glockenspiel. MEL (VOICEOVER): You got it going on. A decent job, good friends. [cuffs rattling] Does my intelligence frighten you? MEL (VOICEOVER): What can I say? You're a rock and roll kind of guy. [mel playing the sax] My dad totally music. Actually, you look kind of like him. [band playing] Don't you just love babies? They're so cute and helpless. Daphne, I'm home. [keys clatter] What's the matter? Are you upset because I didn't come home last night? Is that it? Come on. Look at me. All right. Fine. [playing sax] [light piano music playing] [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. I'd like to dedicate this last song to Mindy, my wife of 23 years, whose birthday it is today. I love you, baby. You make every day count. [playing piano] BARTENDER: Happy Father's Day, man. I don't have any kids. OK. My bad. They told me to use my judgment. [lips smacking] I'm going to check out, OK? All right. [giggles] Hey, Mel, you sounded real good tonight. Oh, thank you. You ever think life didn't turn out like you planned? Not lately. Do you ever wonder, is this all there is? Far as I know. Feel like lending a hand? And how do you account for the fact that, halfway through your adult life, one day, you wake up and you wonder, how the hell did I get here? Where did I go wrong? I just thought that things would be different, that I would have met somebody by now. Life would make sense. You can't relate to any of this, can you? Nope. You're a lucky man. [music on radio] Oh, look, I found the last piece of the barn. Oh, yes you did. Now let's see if we can find the milkmaid's head. Or we could take a little break. We already took a little break before finishing the windmill. [giggles] Ah, found it. Ugh, I remember we used to go on picnics to places like this. I was still a little girl at the time. And me and Olga-- that's older sister-- we used to beg our mother to make surstromming, which is kind of a fermented herring, you know? Mm. Ah, yes. It tastes so good with tunnbrod. But then there was this one time we didn't realize that someone had left the surstromming outside in the sun. Let's move in together. What? Yeah. Let's move in together. [soft laugh] You did what? Why are you so surprised? You're the one that's always preaching maturity and compromise. Yeah, but I didn't think you were going to do anything about it. Since when do you listen? You're making me feel like it's a bad idea. No. I mean, it might turn out great. It better. I'm subletting my apartment. [knock on door] Yeah. Coming. Ginger Thomas. We spoke on the telephone. Yeah. Mel. Come on in. Hmm. You're English. Yes. I know. Oh, I'm still in the process of cleaning things up. Hmm. Have you been showing the flat a lot? Actually, no. You're the first person to look at it. And the rent is $1,500 a month? That's right. May I see the wash room? Yeah. Help yourself. Ah. The left. Thank you. Sorry. [toilet flushes] Yes. Well, this would be quite convenient. It's right near my work. MEL: I think I explained to you that this is part of a trial arrangement, so you'll have to be flexible. Right. [curtain rings rattle] You also said I might have it for six months. [shower running] Well, that's a possibility, but I was thinking of the shorter term to begin with. You did. [clears throat] Which way is the bedroom? [music playing] MEL: I was taking a week to start off. You're joking. Or a couple of weeks. Just to make sure that things are working out. Oh, no. I couldn't possibly take for less than a month. [screams] I was wondering where these were. [cuffs rattle] Hmm. [clears throat] So I'll come around tomorrow and go over the paperwork. In the meantime, I have a short biography, a letter from the bank, and, of course, professional references from the clinic. Oh, you're a doctor? An amphibian behaviorist. Frogs, mainly. Oh, great. So do we have an agreement? Do I have a choice? [light chuckle] Oh, good. OK. Good. [music playing] [sighs] [horns honking] [cork squeaks] WOMAN: I wouldn't. [laughs] Stop it. It'll probably cost extra. It's going to be all right, honey. No it won't. Bruce has a thing about me being late. [horns honking] [thud] Oh my gracious. Is that man hurt? What the hell's the matter with you? Huh? You didn't see this? He looks just fine to me. [music playing] Schmuck. [case thuds] Wait. Wait. Wait. Does that ferry service go to Brooklyn? Yeah. I believe so, ma'am. I'm getting out. Diana, calm down. Honey, what the hell's wrong with that daughter of yours? I'll meet you there. Thank you. DIANA: Hey! Hey! Wait! Hold the boat. Oof! Jesus. Thank you. You're-- you're welcome. [marine horn honks] [music playing] DIANA: Excuse me. This goes to Brooklyn, right? FERRYMAN (INTERCOM): Ladies and gentlemen, our final stop is Brooklyn, Hunters Point. Please make sure you have all of our belongings. Never mind. Thanks. [music playing] DIANA: Hi. Excuse me, sir, but do you know the area? MAN: No English. DIANA: Ugh, not even a little bit? [non-english speech] Ugh. Hi. Sorry to keep bothering you. Do you know where the Brooklyn Mansion is? Yes. Yes? Well, is it far? I'm in kind of a hurry. Not far at all. In fact, I'm going there myself. You are? I think you might have hired me to play at your wedding. Oh. You're one of the musicians from the Wedding Farm Band. Well, actually, I'm freelance. Oh, I'm so glad I found you. Well, I'm glad you found me too. Big day for you, huh? You look beautiful. Stunning, actually, in that dress. And not that I've seen you in anything else. It's just-- what? - My bracelet. I just had it. Oh. I got it. Hey. Oh. Oh, crumb. It's broken. Would you mind holding onto it? I don't have any pockets. Oh. I don't mind. Can I tell you a secret? Uh, sure. You know how, one day, you wake up and this is your life, and you don't know how you got there? Yeah. I feel that way every day. I mean, what if I'm not cut out for this? What if I don't measure up? What if he doesn't think I'm pretty enough or smart enough, or what if he gets bored of me? I mean-- [chuckles] I can't afford to cry right now. Ugh, my makeup took hours and-- [sniffling] I shouldn't have said anything. You're going to think I'm a bad bride. [chuckles] No. No, I-- I'm glad you told me. You're sweet. I'm Diana. Hi, Diana. You almost gave your father a heart attack. [sighs] I won't ask. Wish me luck. DIANA'S MOTHER: What were you thinking? All right, guys. I want it tight and clean tonight. That means you, jazz man. It's a pretty swanky affair. Groom is to be some big wig at the YAA. YAA? Yogurt Association of America. Oh. Oh, yeah. He's flying solo now, launching his own company. [snaps fingers] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Bruce and Diana Ledford. [applause and cheering] [piano playing] May I have your attention. please? Time to hear from the best man. [applause] To the yogurt king and his queen. Hear, hear. EVERYONE: Hear, hear. That's good stuff. [applause] INGA: Guess who called me this afternoon. Who? INGA: Stellan. Who? My brother, Stellan. I told you about him. He wants to come visit for a month in August. Why doesn't he stay longer? INGA: That's what I told him. I said, Stellan, we only see each other twice a year. And you know you can always come and stay with us. Did I tell you how the first time he came here, I went to pick him up at the wrong airport? No. I went to JFK and I was supposed to pick him up at Newark. I thought it was JFK because I normally come to JFK, and how could I know it was Newark? So I went to JFK and he was at Newark, and there we were. I did not know what to do because he didn't have a cell phone. So how could I get a hold of him? [echoing and fading voices] Did you just fall asleep? No. I thought you'd want to know about my family. Oh, I do. Mel, you're a million miles away. Be honest. Do I bore you? Maybe. A little? I am not boring! I'm complex and intriguing! And you just can't see that because you're only interested in yourself. And you know what? You're not that interesting either! [window slams] Inga, you forgot my wallet. [music playing] Oh no. Oh no. OK. Hang in there, Daphne. [window squeaking] [grunting] GINGER: I've got a pistol! No! Ginger! Ginger! It's Mel. What-- what on Earth are you doing here? Look, I have no place else to go. GINGER: Well, the least you could have done is called. I was afraid I'd wake you up. GINGER: Well, as it turns out, you did wake me up. Look, it's kind of an emergency. Can you help? Should I run some more cold water? If you want to put her into shock, that's an excellent idea. You're really good with fish. Don't try to butter me up. I just don't think your fish should have to suffer the consequences of your Bohemian lifestyle. [clears throat] I don't know how to thank you. [water running] You're welcome. I know it's kind of awkward, but you think I could spend the night? What? I'm in kind of a jam. [chuckles] Oh. I take it things didn't work out. No. They did not. I must be out of my mind. You won't even know I'm here. Yes. Good. Man, I don't want to rain on your parade, but she's married. Well, technically, I met her before she was married. Let it go, man. This one's not for you. What do you mean, let her go? This is possibly the first time I've ever fallen in love. Possibly. Exactly my point. What do you know about her? Nothing. She appears out of thin air-- Like a vision, like time stood still. Well, time obviously didn't stand still or she wouldn't have had to run for the boat. The point is forget the vision. Forget this woman. I mean, she just got married for Christ's sake. Let her be happy. Well, don't know if she's happy. I do know she's out of your league. What? You never heard of love transcending socioeconomic barriers? Did you see the ring on her finger? That rock probably cost more than you and I will make in a lifetime. Her panties probably cost more than your rent. What are you saying, she's shallow? I give up. What? Why? I'm wasting my breath. You pretend to want advice, but you're going to do whatever the hell it is you want. Yeah. You're going to chase after her. You're going to drive me crazy. And for all I know, you'd probably get what you want. [chuckles] Yeah. I hope so. [key turning] Ginger? We need to talk. You're welcome for last night. I took the liberty of packing up your things. Listen, I'm sorry. But as you can see, the situation's changed and, well, I won't be able to sublet you my apartment. Well, you did. So I'm going to assume that you'll make other arrangements. I'll help you find a new apartment, but the deal is off. I'll refund your money and we'll call it a day. Well, we'll call it a today if it suits you, but the deal stands. I remind you, I have a lease. Listen, I told you from the beginning, you'd have to be flexible. Are you raising your voice at me? I don't appreciate it when-- when people raise their voice at me. Fine. I want my apartment back. Fine. You'll have it back at the end of the month. In the meantime, the civil thing to do would be go out and stay in a hotel. If I could afford one, believe me, I would. Well, that's not my problem, is it? It is, because I'm staying. Well, so am I. Fine. [pan clatters] [spits] [blender whirring] Stop it! Please, be quiet. Shut up. Listen, I'm going to make a deal. I'm listening. We split the rent and we both stay here somehow until you find another place to live. Either way, in three weeks, you're out. So if it happens sooner than that, I'll be here as your guest. And if, God forbid, it takes longer than that, you'll be here as mine. Nobody gets put out on the street. Nobody gets hurt. Everyone is equally unhappy. [music playing] I keep the bedroom. Fine. And you will have to adhere to a few house rules. House rules? I'll need the bathroom clear every morning at 6:30. Oh. It's all yours. And I insist on a quiet time after 11:00 PM. Seeing that I get up early, I would appreciate no company after hours. No company? It's non-negotiable. I see. Well, then I have few house rules of my own. Mm-hmm. Fair enough. [sniff] Since I work nights and I need my beauty rest, I'd appreciate it if you kept things down until about noon. [scoffs] I'm extremely quiet in the morning. Second, since you're going to be sleeping in my bed, I'd appreciate it if we enforce the no company rule for you too. I see. You can always stay in a hotel. Well, then it seems we understand each other perfectly. Goodnight, Mel, I'll catch you later. Freddie. Hey, man, I just gave you my last quarter. What do you want from me? Support. Brooklyn Mansion Wedding Planning? Hey. Margo? Hey, it's Mel. How are you doing, gorgeous? Yeah. Hey, listen, you remember the wedding there Saturday? Diana Ledford. Yeah. Well, I found her bracelet. You did. Shh. Yeah. Yeah. Or I could just, you know, drop it by our apartment if you have the address. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. She seemed like a sweet girl. Yeah. She what? Yeah. - Ow! Well, that makes sense. (QUIETLY) What the hell's wrong with you? Yeah. All right. Thanks, Margo. Yeah. I love you too. Bye. They're on their honeymoon. Well, guess what? That's what married people do. Bali. Is that tacky or what? You know, the best thing you can do, Mel, is throw that piece of paper in the garbage can. I know. Later. Hey, Ginger. What are you doing out here? I'm stargazing. what does it looks like? [sniff] What, did you forget your keys? [laughs] It's funny. Laugh it up. Ha ha. I knew I had them. Oh no. [music playing] They said it'd be another half hour. [sighs] Do you mind if I ask you what happened? What, just now? No, with your girlfriend. Oh. Well, it's-- it's none of my business. Never mind. With Inga? We were wrong for each other, I guess. I felt like I had to make it work, you know? Be mature, embrace commitment, blah blah blah. Then out of the blue, I met this other girl and things just fell apart. So you-- so you think this other woman was-- was more right? When I looked into her eyes, it wasn't like looking into another pretty face. It was like a bomb going off in my heart. And-- and that's a good thing, I take it. It never happened to you? Once. Well, you see? There are some people with whom you can have an instant connection. Must be chemical or something. What are you doing? Are you taking notes? A few. Do you mind? Do I mind? I mean-- [chuckles] what are you, a cop? I find it interesting, and it pertains to my research. But never mind. It's rude. It's rude. It's too strange to be rude. What-- what is your research? Oh. Well, at the moment, I'm-- I'm studying the cellular basis of the male sexual behavior in the South African clawed frog. [chuckles] Sorry. Wow. That's almost word-for-word what I was just talking about. No. Insofar as we like to draw parallels of patterns of human mating rituals and sexuality. It's quite relevant, you know. Well, how am I like one of your frogs? Well, in the short time that I've known you, I would say you've demonstrated patterns of proclamatory male sexual behavior with no evidence of long-term pair bonding. Right. All right. Well, I'll give you, the long-term thing has been kind of problematic. But this new woman-- Mm-hmm. --I can really see us together. I just can't explain it. [birds singing] [music playing] A great man, my grandfather. Vishnu Anubam Rajit Patel, a man of vision. I'm here to see Diana Ledford. She's expecting you. A man of courage. He came here to this country-- elevator-- with the shirt on his back and a head full of ideas. Elevator? And within months, bingo, he hits the jackpot. - Hello, gorgeous. - Hey. That's a nice outfit. [laughs] So are we still going to lunch later? Oh, I can't, honey. I got a big day. They're going to show me those designs for the three ounce cups, at least for the fruit flavors. I'm having so many problems with my low fat guys. I don't know what they do all day. [ding-dong] It's probably the dry cleaner. - Oh. Could you maybe go down and-- Oh, one second. [cow moo ring tone] Hello? (QUIETLY) Yeah. Go ahead, honey. Thanks. Yeah. That's right. (QUIETLY) Go get it. Go get it. Uh-huh. Yeah. What is the hold up on the Berry Bonanza? Oh my. Hi. Sorry. Come on in. [door thuds] (QUIETLY) Holy cow. Unbelievable. I have a presentation in 45 minutes and my blueberry vendor has lost his mind. Oh. Well, the guy is waiting downstairs. Do you think maybe you could go and-- [cow moo ring tone] - Go ahead. --deal with that right now? Sorry. Hello? Ugh. Honey? - Parker? - I'm not dressed. Yeah. Go ahead then. It's fine. You're not going to believe this. No. My guy in Vermont is growing pot instead of blueberries. [clattering] DIANA: Be there in just a sec. Hey. I'll need this back by Wednesday. - Uh-- - OK. Perfect. Thanks. Listen, can I give this to you? DIANA: Wait! Wait! Oh. Good. Thanks. Diana. Yes? You don't recognize me? You do look kind of familiar. We met the day of your wedding. Oh. I was in the band, but we met on the ferry. Now I remember. So how you been? Well, I've been-- I haven't been able to get you out of my mind, is the thing. [nervous chuckle] I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. I-- I'm embarrassing you. Do I look embarrassed? See, the thing is, when I look at you-- when I look in your eyes-- I'm sorry. It's just-- you're married. No more flirting. I'm sorry. This-- [sighs] Well, you never told me your name. Melvin, technically. But my my friends call me Mel. Mel. Well, you never know. Maybe I'll see you around the neighborhood. [music playing] Oh. Diana! Diana. [groans] Your bracelet. [frog croaking] [clears throat] Hello. I, uh, didn't have a chance to introduce myself. And since we're practically neighbors, Harry Kelp. Ginger Thomas. Pleasure. I loved your paper on sexual dimorphism in the laryngeal nucleus of Xenopus tropicalis. It read like a steamy novel. Oh, well, thank you. As a matter of fact, your approach reminded me a little of-- hmm, you have probably never heard of him, but Ronald Elmore Pritchard. You can't even say that. He's my hero. Me-- me too. [frog croaking] Sean, did you register that? Yup. Make sure you get the laryngeal contraction rate, yes? I don't mean to keep you, but I was told you were still looking for an apartment? Oh, actually, I am. I may know of someone. A friend of mine. Well, a friend of a friend, to be precise. But I'd be happy to recommend you. Oh, well, that's very thoughtful of you, Dr. Kelp. Please, call me Harry. DIANA: Mel. Yeah? There's something wrong with Daphne. Ah, she just wants some attention. [scoffs] I highly doubt that. I think she might be epileptic. Oh yeah? Watch this. Hold that. Oh. [playing sax] That's her favorite. What? it's not scientific enough for you? I had no idea you played so beautifully. You should come by the club and hear us play some time. Oh, maybe I will. Oh. Thanks. Hmm. Well, [clears throat] I'm off. Hmm. Another apartment? Oh, yes. But they don't have a shred of hope. A friend set it up, so we'll see. I would hate to think I'd be sponging off your spectacular generosity next month. I'm not such a bad guy. [scoffs] Don't flatter yourself. [door closes] [band playing music] [applause] FREDDIE: Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, we're going to take a short break, and we'll be back in about 15 minutes. [applause] [giggles] What are you doing here? That was wonderful. Really? I thought we were kind of off tonight. [scoffs] Freddie, this Ginger. Ginger, Freddie. How you doing? I was just telling Mel I thought the music was fantastic. I like her already. So you two are roommates, huh? Well, not anymore. I found a flat. - Really? What's the matter? I thought you'd be ecstatic. Oh, well, I am. You don't look it. What, are you kidding? I'll be happy to have my bed back. What happened that one time for you, when the bomb went off in your heart, huh? You thought I wasn't listening. - We got engaged. - Ah. See? I knew it. And then broke it off a month later. Why? Well, he wanted citizenship and I mistook it for passion. Simple miscommunication, really. Would have helped if I spoke Armenian. It'd be a lot simpler if we could choose who we fall in love with, wouldn't it? Well, I like to think we can exercise a certain level of discrimination. You really believe that? I do. Well, to me, I try. Oh! Mel, I forgot. I wanted to ask you a favor. I thought this was a favor. Well, another favor. I was wondering if I could borrow Daphne for a few days. What for? Oh, I'd like to take some measurements. Oh, no. What? Just on her response to music. You already saw her response to music. What more do you want? I'd like to measure her reactions on a physical level. You see, fish produce small electric pulses that are measured in wave forms. I just want to know on a cellular level what she's responding to in music. It's not just music. It's my playing. Perhaps. Perhaps nothing, I'm telling you. Well, if that were the case, it'd be very unusual. Daphne and I have a special bond. What's unusual about that? Well, scientifically, aquatic vertebrates are limited to electrophysiological responses. Meaning? - Fish can't feel. - Emotions. GINGER: Right. Right. Then why don't you bring her by, and we'll have a look? Hm? Bingo, Bingo, man-- the word, the game, little old ladies poking holes in papers, he invented it, my granddad, yeah. Dry cleaner? Yes, yes. Go ahead. And he made a fortune. You know what he did with that fortune? He gave it me. Why, you ask? Because in his own words, there's a fortune here to be made every week. Another week, another fortune. [music playing] Diana? Mel? Oh. What are you doing here? I was just in the neighborhood. Oh. Can I give you a hand with something? Um, yeah. Can you help me carry it upstairs? Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, sure. [music playing] This is really sweet of you. I just saw it, and I had to have it. It made me think of Bruce. It's so him. Don't you think? It's very prickly. Yeah. Well, it's just right up here. You don't see too many cactuses like that where I come from. - Yeah? - Yeah. Where are you from? DIANA: Boise girl. Boise girl. DIANA: Born and bred. Well, how's life in the big city treating you? It's OK. It's just everybody seems so busy all the time, you know? Especially Bruce. Oh, yeah. DIANA: Oh, you can put that there. Oh, yeah, oh, OK. Oof. I mean, it's not like I don't respect what he does, you know? It's just-- I mean, he's under a lot of pressure. - Yeah. - I get that. I don't know. It's just kind of-- oh, crud. I'm going to be late. Oh, yeah, yeah. I should be going. Oh, yeah. Do you mind grabbing the elevator? [ding] Wow. Thanks. Look at you. Do you mind doing me up? Uh-- You want to hear something funny? Sure. I probably see Robert more than I see Bruce-- well, saw. Who's Robert? He's the elevator guy. Oh. He retired. Here you go. [sighs] Now I really have nobody to talk to. Well, you can talk to me, if you want to. Suits you. [ding] Seven, please. Se-ven. Siete. Have you ever even been to the snack bar? My grandfather-- stay with me. Now, when he got here, there was no such term, OK? Now, he got to thinking-- snack and bar, snack and bar. [clucks tongue] Snack bar. Excuse me? Yes. Are you looking for someone to run the elevator? Yeah. Fill this out. [music playing] Thanks, I'm all set. [chatter] [frogs croaking] Ah, there you are. GINGER: Hello, you two. This place is a labyrinth. You know, I wouldn't entrust her to just anyone. Well, fortunately, I'm not just anyone. Hello. - All right. How's the new apartment? Do you miss me yet? Hm. Well, you know, it's coming along. I still need to fix some things. I need to get some tools. - Oh, I have-- I have tools. What do you need? Ah, well, you know, I need to fix the drapes and hang some pictures. I'm sure that's a terribly engaging prospect. Oh, I can help. So this is where you work, huh? Yes. Do you want me to show you around? Yeah. Oh, I should show you the frog room. Yeah, come on. Let's go look at the frogs. Oh, leave her here. We'll get her back. [warbling] So let me show you some of our star subjects. [warbling] This here is Tarzan, very dramatic vocal patterns. He gets a very strong response from the ladies. There's no way Daphne's spending the night here with all these frogs. Now, this here is Esteban-- also quite the lady's frog. [croaking] He has the highest laryngeal contraction rate of croak. You don't say. Then here, last but not least, is Casanova. Tut, tut, tut. [croaking] Well, the name says it all, really. Hm. MEL: You're really committed to this, aren't you? It's my way of understanding relationships. You never wanted to be anything else? Well, I wanted to be a ballerina when I was younger and a teacher and a fireman, because I fancied the boots. Who you want to be isn't necessarily who you are, you know. And I really like what I do. I'm quite good at it. It shows. [croaking] You want my prediction? This whole thing's going to come back and bite you in the ass. Look, I'm a little bit nervous about my first day of work. So I'd appreciate it if you'd say something positive. Pay up. MEL: Thanks. [ding] Bye-bye. Diana, the elevator's here. Hurry up. Chop chop. You new? [sighs] Hey, tell me something. Which do you prefer? One's a smile. One's a grin. Now, what I want to know is, which one grabs you and says, this is my kind of yogurt? Well, that's a tough choice. You're damn straight it is. Personally, I like to smile. I see what you mean. I think It's classier. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Well, honey, this man has a good eye. [buzzing] Hold this, please. Thank you. [beep] Hello, Stan the man. What do you mean our VP is lactose intolerant? What are you talking about? You said it suited me. It does. All right. [music playing] Oh, come on, Daphne. You like this music. Oh, yes, it makes you feel good. Yes, oh, you love it. You love it. She's been working very hard. Yes, yes, you love it. So I kept racking my brain. Mhm. What kind of electrophysiological characteristics could I use? And then one day, it dawned on me. Somatic efficacy. Exactly. GINGER: Hm. Oh, hello. Dr. K-- Harry, this is Mel. Hello. GINGER: Well, thank you so much for walking me home. That was very sweet. My, uh, my pleasure. GINGER: I'll see you tomorrow. Hm. Who's that guy? He's a colleague. You should be careful about letting random men with large umbrellas walk you home. I mean, how well do you know him? Exactly, you see? It's not even raining. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself, thank you. Oh, yeah, you seem real tough at first. But on the inside, you're all squishy. I am not squishy. You are. You're kind of squishy. I am not. All right, you're as tough as nails. Now open up your apartment. We got a lot of work to do. Here, that's for you. Me? Yeah, a housewarming present. Wow, that's out of character. [music playing] [sighs] Ow. Oh, oh, wait. Wait. You can't drink champagne under the glare of a 100 watt bulb. It just simply isn't done. Where's the switch? Yeah, right. This I'd like to see. It's pretty fancy, very impressive. Let-- let me show you how a professional does it. Watch this. Please. No, no, no. Ah. Thank you. Thank you very much. You realize we don't have any glasses. Hm. Huh. Hey. [ding] See anything interesting? A poodle in a raincoat. I thought life in New York would be so glamorous, you know? It's really just a lot of tall buildings and traffic. Yeah. I wind up feeling invisible half the time. Are you kidding me? I've never met anybody less invisible in my life. You're sweating. Am-- am I? Yeah. Oh, well, yeah. Ahem. I guess it's warming up. I hear it's only going to get hotter. Yeah. It's the, uh, ahem humidity that gets you. Hm. Every been to Houman Bookstore and Cafe? Have dinner with me. Huh? Have dinner with me. Why? Uh, so we can have a conversation that lasts more than 17 floors. I don't know, Mel. Right, yeah, I understand. Look, uh, there's my card, in case you change your mind. 17. - Thank you. [ding] [music playing] So how's life in the elevator? Well, it's all right, I guess. I'd go mad going up and down all day. I don't know how you do it. It's true. I have been getting kind of impatient lately, waiting around whole days just to see her for a couple of minutes. Sometimes I'm ready to walk away from the whole thing. Well, why don't you? Because at some point, she gets on the elevator, and she smiles. And I know it sounds kind of kooky, but that makes the whole day worthwhile. Hm. Ugh, they forgot the ice cream. I mean, there's no joy in it without the ice cream. I mean, that's what being a la mode is all about. Uh, let me get you some ice cream. No, I'm quite capable of taking care of myself. Thank you. - Yeah, ouch. Meaning? Well, you've been kind of moody lately. Is everything all right? Everything is splendid. Thank you. Well, I mean, something's on your mind. Is it work? Actually, I don't enjoy asking you this. But if you don't mind, will you come by the lab to play for Daphne? What? Go ahead. Say it. I told you. [croaking] All right, whenever you're ready. Ready? Yep. Sorry, I got distracted. You have all the time in the the world. That's pretty cool. Hm, let me see that. Hm. Obviously, I'm missing something. It's all right. It's good for you to be wrong once in a while. Did you see that? Good girl. [knocking] MAN AT DOOR: Hello? Hey. [knocking] Hey. What's going on? - What's going on, man? - Come on. Get dressed, man. We got to be at the Algonquin in half an hour. Oh, I've got work today. Well, don't tell me you're not coming. Well, they hired a 12 piece band, didn't they? I mean, you got three horns. They're going to want mostly Motown anyway. Well, what about our set tonight? I'll try to make it. You know, people work hard to get where we are. But you don't understand that, because you don't know what it's like to work at something, whether it's music or anything else. What are you talking about? You don't know what you've got. That also means you don't know you're throwing it away. I'm not throwing anything away. She's married, Mel. Why can't you get that through your thick head? She's not going to leave her millionaire husband for you. They never do. She's starting to care about me. She does not care about you. She needs you to hit the right button when she gets on the elevator, so she puts up with you. The people who care about you turn you off. That's why you live with a fish, Mel. [music playing] (SINGING) He's got it all, but where is the peace-- Are you going to be home for dinner tonight? Depends how my meetings go. (SINGING) But it he can't find. So what do you think? I just got it. It's nice. You didn't even look. I never should have gotten into the dairy-based movie business. Honey, tell me honestly. Do I look bloated in this version? Hm? Look at my cheeks. They look like a goddamn chipmunk. (SINGING) Can't you see? Where are you going? - Out. Out? You're not even dressed. You noticed. BRUCE: Of course I noticed. I notice everything. Honey, hey. (SINGING) It's simply not fair. He's got it all, but there is-- I got to get a nose job. [ding] Yes. [ding] Lobby. Is everything all right? What do you care? What do you mean, what do I care? Just leave me alone. Can you do that? [music playing] [ding] Thanks. Hey, wise guy, change of plan. I'm on my way. There better be a chair for me. [phone ringing] Hey, I just left you a message I'm on my way. DIANA (ON PHONE): What? What? Who is this? DIANA (ON PHONE): This is Diana Ledford. Is Mel there? It's-- it's me. Diana, what's wrong? Mel, I'm so lost. Me too. No, I mean literally. I-- I can't find my way out. I'm in Central Park. At least I think it's Central Park. All the paths look the same. And it's going to get dark. Now Bruce is in a meeting. I have read about how the park gets really dangerous at and how all those people get killed on the jogging trails. I don't even jog. I never should have come here. I should have stayed in Boise. Diana, I'm coming for you. [music playing] Can you hurry up? We've got to move. We've got to move. Thank you. She's-- she's stuck in the park naked, my wife, yeah. I'm-- no, not you, sir, no, I'm sorry. No, can you hold on, please? We tried frozen yogurt. It didn't work. The age of frozen yogurt is over. OK, thank you. Literally, how far are we, Claudia? How far are we? Honey, I'm three minutes away. Three-- well, now we're in traffic. [music playing] [honking] [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. We're going to take a short break, and we'll be right back. What a pleasant surprise. I've been here twice in one month. Does that make me a groupie? Mel's not here, in case you're looking for him. Not really. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. Oh, lovely. European. Eu-er-a-pe-an. No. I'm sorry. Oh, well, speak of the devil. Hey, the set's over, in case you were wondering. You can't imagine the day that I've had. Oh what happened? Did a button get stuck? Did a button get stuck? That's funny. It took him all day. Oh, we were just psychoanalyzing you. Oh, really? And we decided that you're pathologically afraid of being alone. Me and everybody else. Please, I beg to differ. Nothing is worse than feeling alone with another person. Mm, I'd much rather be lonely by myself. Well, at least I know I'm good company. Uh-oh. Well. That's it. I am not drunk. I know. But I just want to make sure you get home safe. What do you care? I'm a nice guy. No, you're not. But I like you anyway. Oh, gee, thanks. You're not even my type. I didn't think so. Here. I lied. Oh. Mm, mm. Wait, wait, wait, wait. OK. Wait. Oh, god. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. I can't. I don't think it's a good idea. I should go. Of course you should. Yeah. Good night. [music playing] (WHISPERING) Stupid. [sniffling] [phone ringing] GINGER (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hello, this is Ginger Thomas. Please leave me a message after the beep. Thank you. [beep] Well, I was just about to give up on you. So where is she? There you go, precious Daphne. [croaking] Why's your frog staring at my fish? Why's your fish staring at my frog? What'd you do to her? I didn't do anything to her. Then why is she acting so goofy? GINGER: I don't know. There's no such thing as cross species attraction. OK, well, whatever that means, I don't appreciate it. Well, what are you getting so angry about? And frankly, I'm the one who's a little humiliated here. So that's what this is about, last night, huh? I'd-- I'd rather not talk about it. You're the one that brought it up. You know, I wish last night had never happened. OK, so do I. Great. So why don't you take your little fish and off you go. Ginger, sometimes you can be a little hostile, you know? GINGER: Oh, really? You kissed me, remember? You didn't have to return the favor. I wanted to at the time, all right? It didn't mean anything. We can still be friends, can't we? Wrong. We can't still be friends? It did mean something. You knew from the beginning that I was involved with Diana. That's why I told you about her. This may come as a shock, but the world does not revolve around you, you know? And I'm not just saying that because I'm a scientist. Honey, this Acidophilus Man of the Year Award means so much to me. Which ones are more CEO-like? Good eye. Uh, do you know where my sample case is? It's here. BRUCE: Oh, thanks. So maybe I should just wander the streets on my own. Uh, sure. Yeah, that sounds good. Um, do you know where my baseball cap is? Oh, thanks, honey. Maybe I should have an affair. Um, sure. OK, well, I am off. Ah, right. Well, wish me luck. Me too. BRUCE: You look great. [music playing] [phone ringing] Ginger? DIANA (ON PHONE): Hey, Mel. It's Diana. I didn't get a chance to thank you for yesterday. Thank me? Thank me for what? So I was wondering about your dinner offer. How's tonight? GINGER: Come on, Casanova. Say something. Croak. Why are you being so difficult? It's one croak. Bloody hell. Uh, Dr. Thomas? Hm? Are you going to be needing me all day? Of course I'll be needing you. That's what you're here for, isn't it? It's just I have a date tonight, and I was kind of hoping to get home and take a shower. A date, oh, how nice, how nice. Well, by all means, all we're really trying to do here is make a couple of breakthroughs in reproductive biology. I mean, nothing to put your life on hold for, really, hm? So in fact, I've got a good idea. Why don't we shut down the lab and all go on dates? So that's a no. Cheers. Cheers. I've got something for you. DIANA: Yeah? Yeah. Oh, my god, I completely forgot. I-- I thought you'd want to have it back. You know, you remind me of someone back home. Really? Actually, it's the guy who gave me the bracelet. Oh. I was his first. Is that right? He was my, gosh, hm-- it was kind of fun-- 11th. Oh. 12th, depends on how you do the math. Anyway, he was such a sensitive type, Chuck. Ah. No, that was his brother. Dick. Dick? That was his name. Oh. Such a sweetheart. But you know how some people never really do it for you? Yeah. Oh, my god, Sean, Casanova's missing. Oh, god. Where is the little bugger? Oh, Casanova, don't do this to me. Casanova, come on. My knees are killing me. Hello? With the additional funding for my studies of the reproductive techniques of these iguanas, I believe that we would end up saving money. I mean, one of the reasons that I want to-- What about our visiting scientist, Dr. Thomas? Any sense of her progress? Oh, she's tremendously dedicated and so meticulous. Stop him. Stop him. Oh, you stupid frog. Oh. When I get my hands on you-- A new shock method she's testing out, it's an English thing. You think this is very funny, don't you? No, bad frog, bad frog. You like me, don't you? Let's go, before I change my mind. Uh-- Check? OK, so why don't you jump into bed, and I'll go gussy up? [music playing] It's a little wrinkled. I was carrying it in my pocket book. It's very nice. Yeah. I'm a little drunk. Normally I'm a really good dancer. Oh, whoops, my shoe came off. Oh, that's a problem. But I can fix it. Hold on. OK, there. Sexy? Do it. We don't have to rush into anything. Come on. You've been hanging out in my elevator for the past few weeks. I think it's time you pushed some of my buttons. That's what I'm talking abut. We really ought to get to know each other a little bit. Yeah. I have all the information I need. Oh, speaking of information, look at this. This will tell us a little bit about the hotel. Do they have dirty movies? No. This says here that the hotel was erected in 1910. That's the only thing we're going to erect here, baby. Oh. First try, come on. I'll be right back. OK. Whew. Diana, we need to talk. I-- uh, tonight was incredibly special, and I find you unbelievably beautiful. But it doesn't feel right. I-- it's not that I don't want to. Believe me. Uh, a part of me really wants to. But another part of me wants something else. It wants something more. Did you ever feel like you were alone when you were with another person? All the time. Yeah. I'm sorry. Ah, it's probably better all around. Yeah. Tell her I said hi. Who? Your girlfriend, whoever she is, tell her I said hi. [music playing] Ginger! Ginger. What are you doing here? - I was looking for you. - Oh, Mel-- I've got something to tell you. No, Mel. OK, I know this is going to surprise you. No, Mel-- I don't want to say anything. I just want you to listen. No, somebody's sitting there. Where? I'm with someone. Oh, oh, Harry, this is Mel. I believe you've met. HARRY: Hello. Ah, Mel was just leaving. But you don't know what I came here to say. Well, I'll be home later. You can phone me then. Well, later might be too late. He's not usually like this. Listen, Harry, do you mind giving me and your date a few minutes? Harry, sit down. You're making this awful difficult. I'm making it difficult. I can go sit at the counter. No, Harry, you're not going anywhere. Ginger-- What? I'm in love with you. Diana's not right for me. You are. Who is Diana? I-- Well, aren't you going to say something? Am I supposed to dissolve into a puddle because you decide that I may be your type after all? Yeah, well, you know, it came as a surprise to me too. Frankly, it's a little insulting. Why is it insulting? Well, I-- I don't fancy being a fallback, Mel. We biologists have our pride, you know. You're not a fallback. I-- I just didn't know what I was feeling. It just kind of, you know, crept up on me. Duly noted. Now, if you don't mind, Harry and I would like to have a nice brunch. You see, in addition to Harry's uncommon intelligence, his gentle disposition, and his refined sense of humor, Harry here is a grown up. Yeah. Well, good for Harry. You, uh, look pensive. Are you all right? Splendid. [music playing] It's just you and me, kid. Is something supposed to happen? Apparently not. Ginger, Earth to Dr. Thomas. Yes? You didn't answer my question about dinner Sunday at my mother's. She makes a mean bread pudding. Oh. I can't, Harry. Oh, well, perhaps the following. No, I-- I-- I just can't, you know? Oh, I see. You're a wonderful person. And you're going to make the right woman very happy one day, truly. That's what my mother says. Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in. Did the elevator go out of service? No, I quit. You look terrible. Oh, well, thanks. We, um, had to get another sax player. Right. Well, I just thought I'd stop in, let you know I wasn't dead. FREDDIE: I was beginning to wonder. There's a wedding on Thursday night talking about adding a horn. Think you can handle it? A wedding, huh? Yeah, sure, why not? FREDDIE: No falling for the bride. No, not unless her name's Ginger. Oh, Ginger, eh? Sit down, man. Let me buy you a drink. Don't worry. Nobody likes him. Who? The new sax player-- he trained at a conservatory. I give him two weeks tops. [music playing] Daphne, I'm home. Daphne? Daphne? Ginger, it's Mel. Pick up the phone. Ginger, Daphne tried to commit suicide. Hi. I, uh, I didn't know who else to call. Where is she? Have you tried playing? Nothing, she's not eating either. How long has she been like this? Since she came back from the lab. I knew I should have never let her go there. She probably got homesick or fear of abandonment. [scoffs] Don't flatter yourself. Where are you taking her? Oh, bloody hell, he's gone again. All right, as long as he hasn't hit the elevators. Casanova. OK, you go that way. I'll-- That's disgusting. [warbling] Casanova? Casanova? Stupid name. I know you're here. Can't hide from Mummy. Ugh. Oh, sorry. What? People bump into each other every day in Britain. It's not a life-altering event. [croaking] [music playing] He hasn't sung in days. He must have been saving it. I'm sorry about what happened at the diner. I hope I didn't ruin your date. It's all forgotten. Are you two still-- No. Ahem. I'm sorry to hear that. You have nothing to be smug about. I miss you. Do you? I want to be with you, Ginger. What makes you think I'm still interested? Can't people make mistakes? It depends on the mistake. Well, what if it was huge? What if it was that some guy went chasing after a woman he didn't even know, even-- even though he'd met this other terrific woman, and they had a terrific friendship? And when he was with her, he felt like a good person, because life was full, like it meant something. I can't kiss you. Why not? Give me one good reason. Because deep down, I doubt that you are capable-- Long term pair bonding. Exactly. People change, Ginger. That's what's nice about us. We evolve. It's such an appealing hypothesis. Where'd you go? I feel like I lost you for a second. I'm right here. [music playing] (SINGING) That was unexpected. I'm left here unprotected. And that's how I want it. That's how I want it. You're outrageous and not my type. Unexpected, and that's what I like. You're a stormy fella, and me with no umbrella. And that's how I want it. That's how I want it. You're outrageous and not my type. Unexpected, and that's what I like. [music playing] (SINGING) Want the doll, want the ball. Want the bling, want a ring. Want to chill, want to thrill, I want it all. I want the doll, want the ball. Want the bling, want a ring. I want to chill, want to thrill. I want it all. I want the peace, and I want the love. I want to climb the peak above. Want the smooth, but I want the crest. Want the calm, but I want the best. Want to chill, but I want to fill the epic of this last thrill. Want my cake and to eat it too. I won't forsake me for you. I want the doll. I want the ball. Something tall. Want the bling, want a ring. Let me sing. I want to chill, want a thrill. Because I'm saying when it's hot, I want a lot. I want it all. Want the doll. I want the ball. Something tall. Want the bling, want a ring. Let me sing. Want to chill, want a thrill. Because I'm saying when it's hot, I want a lot. I want it all. Want to shine. No waiting in line. Want to find all the time. Want it fast, but I want it slow. Want it flat, but I want to grow. I want your bump, but I want more. Want to climb, but I want to soar. I want no risk, but I want return. You turn out, but I want my turn. I want the doll. I want the ball. Something tall. Want the bling, want a ring. Let me sing. Want to chill, want a thrill. Because I'm saying when it's hot, I want a lot. I want it all. I want the doll. I want the ball. Something tall. Want the bling, want a ring. Let me sing. Want to chill, want a thrill. Because I'm saying when it's hot, I want a lot. I want it all.
