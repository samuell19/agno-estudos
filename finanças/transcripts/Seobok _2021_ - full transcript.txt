Doctor Carl Anderson at Seoin Research Institute was killed in a terrorist attack this morning. Are you sure about this? The problem is the grave danger it poses from this experiment. Okay. I will get back to you soon. Just let me remind you, we don't have much time. It's been confirmed. It was a terrorist attack. Who could they be? We don't have any leads yet, but we're certain the project has been exposed. What are you going to do? The project needs to be moved to a safer location. Moved? That's out of the question. - We're in the final stages. - Isn't project security the top priority? The chance of another attack is high and the target is obvious. You need to make a decision. Okay, but under one condition. You can't just show up like this. I haven't slept in two days because of the headaches. A man needs to sleep to live, okay? I'm saying this because I'm worried about you... - If you keep on this way... - Fuck, I'm not going to die! I won't let this kill me. So don't worry about me. What... - What the... - Mr. Min Ki-hun? I'm with the company. Where are you taking me? Who sent you? WARNING WATER SOURCE CONSERVATION AREA This way. You're still alive. Did you miss me? I guess that's a no. It's been two years. You're not happy to see me? You brought me here? What is it? What the hell do you want? Don't get all jumpy. It's not a good look. By the way, you look like shit. Just tell me what you want. I'm not the one who called you. Ki-hun. Long time no see. How are you feeling? I'm fine. I see. That's good to hear. I need you to do a job for me. What kind of a job? A job for your country, of course. I don't work for the company anymore. Of course that's because I need someone I can trust. Can you trust me? Can't I trust you? Remember the day Hyun-soo passed? It's been three years, hasn't it? Time flies, right? What is the job? It involves a classified project of national importance. That's all you need to know. Director Ahn told me about you. You must be Mr. Min. I'm Dr. Shin Hak-sun. We raised the security level due to a recent terrorist attack. We don't think they hit their real target. Sir, the data is out. What is all this? Research for the future. So this ship is a research lab? Correct. Why would you carry out work like this on a ship? Consider it a kind of ark. Let me introduce you to Dr. Lim. She's in charge here. Ten years ago, we successfully cultured genetically manipulated embryonic stem cells. We inserted the hematopoietic stem cells into a fertilized egg through nuclear replacements, then the egg was implanted into a womb. After a seven-month pregnancy, the specimen was created. The male specimen grew at a speed twice the regular rate - of an average human-- - Hang on. Specimen? What is that? Can you open the window? This boy is the first-ever human specimen created through stem cell cloning and genetic manipulation. Are you saying he's a cloned human? I don't know if we can call him human. If potato roots sprout from a tomato plant, what should we call them? He has special genes that are nonexistent in humans. He's a new species, if you like. He's our first successful case. In the early days, cloning was simply creating exact copies of the original DNA. But Seobok is different. His genes were entirely modified through genetic manipulation. Seobok? Oh, that's the specimen's name. Emperor Qin sent off his servant to search for the elixir of immortality 2,500 years ago. That servant represents humanity's desire to overcome death. Seobok was named after him. Seobok is an undying being. His bone marrow produces IPS cells, which are dedifferentiating stem cells. His IPS proteins can cure any and all human diseases. Through him, humans can conquer death. With Anderson gone, Seobok is the only existing source of this technology. He must be protected at all costs. Damn it. This is... I know it's hard to believe. I mean, this is ridiculous. Don't you think so? It's not like you can see that he doesn't die. He looks like an ordinary kid. He's anything but. Let me show you something. You may begin. It's an unexpected side effect. We don't fully understand how it's possible. Seobok has brainwaves far more powerful than us, so we can only assume he controls the pressure around him. That's far from ordinary. I guess it's interesting, sort of like magic. You can stop now. I guess it happens frequently. And it gets worse when stressed or fatigued? Loss of consciousness due to a brain tumor. Is it glioblastoma? I guess you have about six months to a year at best. Mind your own fucking business. I'm offering a clinical trial. I can treat you using Seobok. I can save your life. When the Hwang scandal destroyed the stem cell research environment, Seoin approached us. They'd help us if we help them with their human cloning research. Help you with what? You know what happened that year. The government then didn't think much of it. They could use the money from Seoin and take credit for the work if it succeeded. But it produced an unexpected outcome. An undying specimen. They had to study the specimen to determine its nature, and ten years passed just like that. Frankly, we had forgotten about it until Anderson was killed last night. He was due to submit the final report next month. Who's behind it? It could have been anyone. After all, this is a powerful weapon. Weapon? What do you think a weapon is? The essence of a weapon is fear. The fear that it can kill you. A technology of immortality is a powerful weapon for everyone who fears death. And all men die, just like you. We're moving the specimen to a secret bunker in Wonju. Seoin wants to conduct a clinical trial there. We need a participant for the trial, someone who's not a security liability. That's why I contacted you. So, what do you say? I'll do it. Let me be a part of it. What are they injecting him with? An inhibitor. What for? To suppress cell division, which is too rapid. Like an anticancer drug? Yes, exactly. He needs one every 24 hours. He gets one every day? Yes, otherwise the cell division process will spiral out of control. What happens then? He'll die. But you said he can't die. Of course he can. Wouldn't he die if he was shot or hit by a car? He's not invincible. I heard you'll take part in the trial. - Yes. - Congratulations. I don't know if it's something to be congratulated for. By the way... How likely are the chances of success? Since it's the first trial, no one knows. If it fails, what happens to me? Worst case scenario, you will die, which will happen anyway. Preparation for relocation ready. Preparation for relocation ready. People are so easily scared, aren't they? And greedy as well. What the hell is she saying? And she's smoking in a room and shit. Don't worry, we'll be there soon. We're going to be spending a lot of time together. I'm Min Ki-hun. Mr. Min Ki-hun? You don't have to be formal. Just call me Ki-hun. Have you ever used that before? This? Of course. I'm quite a good shot. On a person? Did he die? How many have you killed? Why do you want to know? What's going on? It's an ambulance. We'll give way for it. Are we changing routes? Why are you not taking the expressway? There's been an accident, so we're making a detour. Copy. Mr. Min's onto us. What should we do? Don't worry about him. How much longer? We'll be arriving in 30 minutes. Keep him distracted. The Americans will be waiting for you. They'll take it from there. Get out of there after contact and report to me right away. What do we do with Mr. Min? Hand him over too. The Americans will take care of him. Yes, sir. What the hell? What's going on? Who the hell are those men? No! Hey Mr. Min? Are you okay? What? Good. - No one's answering? - They're offline, sir. Dammit... Are you there? Yes. Where are we? I don't know. Who were those men? - I don't know. - You saw nothing? What the hell happened? You fell asleep, Mr. Min. Who's that? The men from earlier. Who the fuck are you? No. What's happening? I said no. What? No, no! He said no! John. You okay? John, come in. Hold on! And the specimen? He's fine. What's your location? - Near Boeun, in Chungbuk Province. - What's the nearest safe house? Now! - Point 14, sir. Five kilometers away. - Show me. Jangam-ri 585, Deungcheon. - Did you hear that? - Yes, Jangam-ri 585. Go there. I'll dispatch backup right away. Yes, sir. Where are we going? It's still dangerous. We need to get to safety. - Why is it dangerous? - What? Shit! We'll have to walk. - Come on, what are you doing? - Why is it dangerous? There's no time for this. Hey... Hey! Why am I in danger? You saw everything earlier. - Bad guys are after you-- - Why? Why are they after me? What do you mean why? Because you're the... Because I'm the specimen? Because I don't die? I guess you already know. The bad guys are trying to steal the technology from you. That's why you're in danger. Okay? Men are so foolish. What are you talking about? We don't have time for this. Let's go. How do I know you're not a bad guy? - Do I look like one? - You don't look like a good guy either. Why do you think I'm going through this shit? Why? To protect you! Can't you see that? Why are you trying to protect me? Because my life depends on it. Are you going to do this? - Come at me, then! - Come here! Hurry up already. We can't just stop. We need to keep moving. Can't we go slower? What for? - So I can look around. - Look around? Look, we don't have time for that. Just hurry up. Hey. Hey! Holy crap. Who are you? - Who is it? - What? Yes. Just some kid. He looks like he's not all there. Where do you live? Where is your mom? What the hell are you doing? Oh, you're with your brother. You should take better care of him. He looks like he needs it. Don't let him walk around looking like a lost puppy. Come with me. Damn it. Hey. Hello? Anybody? Good thinking. He'll look much better in nice clothes. You're a good brother. Try on whatever you like. It's 74,000 won, but let's call it 73,000 won. Your little brother is so handsome. He knows his fashion too. Hey! Get away from the window. Don't touch anything. Just stay put. What are you doing? You told me to stay put, Mr. Min. Well, be quiet. You're distracting me. And stop calling me Mr. Min. I'm not your teacher. Unbelievable. I have a question. What is it? Why are you always angry, Mr. Min? Since when was I angry? Hey, are you hungry? Yes. Why aren't you eating? - Can't you use chopsticks? - I don't know how. Use this instead. Good? You've already had three! I don't know what the hell I'm doing... This is why you should watch what your kids eat. What do they feed him, anyway? I get a special supplement. Shame on them for treating a kid like that. Not yet. Give it a couple of minutes. How did you know? Know what? That you're a specimen. Mom told me. You have a mom? You met her. Oh... Dr. Lim is your mom? So you have a mom. What? You don't have one? No. That's too bad. You've lived there your whole life? - Yes. - What do you do all day? I get tested. Eat. And I read. That's it? You get tested and eat? That's your whole life? It's okay, you're doing great. What else, then? Go on, eat. Your noodles will get soggy. But you must be doing something in your free time besides just sitting around. - I keep on thinking. - About what? About my fate. Mr. Min, we're from the company. Punch in the code. Identify yourself. Yum Kyung-jae from Domestic Team 3. Are we leaving now? Yes, please get ready. Is that the specimen? Hey, hey! - What's this? - We have orders to take him out. - Who the fuck told you that? - I can't say. I can clear everything up, just put the gun down. Step aside. I said put the gun down! If you won't step aside, we have no choice. Go on then. Shoot me. Shoot. Is it done? This is Ki-hun. Explain yourself. Ki-hun... I'll tell you everything, but right now, listen to me. Take out the specimen immediately. Did you hear me? Kill it now. That's an order. - What about me? - What? Am I supposed to just die? Wake up, Min. This is for the country. How is this for the country? It's just for you. You think I'll fall for that shit again? Are you disobeying my order? Order, my ass. Do you want to die, you fucking asshole? No, dumbass. I want the exact opposite. Fuck off. Is Seobok okay? - Yes, he's fine. - What are you going to do? You should bring him to the lab. You can't go to intelligence now. We can offer you protection here. - He's bringing him in. - Good. Then... We should get ready for our guests. Now, sir? Why? Is there a problem? Preparation will take time and-- You idiot. Look what they are doing. I didn't do all this so someone could take it from me. Come on, get in. Where are we going now? To the lab. It's the only place we can trust. No. I don't want to go there. Then where? I need to go somewhere. You have no place to go. Ulsan. Why? You don't have to know. You little shit. Get in the car! You don't have to come with me. I can go on my own. And how will you do that? With this. - Where did you get that? - From the house. That's not yours. It's not yours either. I don't know what you're thinking, but you can't keep running like this. There's no time. I know. And you need your injection. We need to get back. I know. What do you know? I said I know. Tell me. What's in Ulsan? At least give me that. Do you really want to know? I want to know what we're going for. By any chance, do you know someone there? Yes. Who? Who is it? Tell me. No. It's better you don't know. Back at the safe house... Did you bend the bullets and smash things? Yes. Why? Nothing. Just curious. Why didn't you step aside? What? When they pulled their guns, why didn't you step aside? Because... if you die, I die. Of course. But why are you dying? It's a punishment. - What's wrong? - It's okay. - No, you're not! - I'm fine. It's been a long time, Mr. Chairman. You've been well? Why are you trying to kill it? Sorry? The specimen. Why are you trying to kill it? What are you talking about, sir? You met with the Americans, didn't you? Come clean. Only then can we talk. What did they want? Futurists from the scientific communities have been warning about this Life Revolution Hypothersis for quite a long time. In fact, humans are the only species that are aware of their own inevitable mortality, and are afraid of it. That very fear of knowing that life someday will end is what makes them pursue a meaning in life. However, if life does not end, people will lose that human element. And what will be left is nothing but greed and desire. Immortality will produce unsatisfiable desires and continuous conflicts. Paradoxically, death is the fundamental element holding life together. In other words, if people become immortal, mankind will lead itself to extinction. We must prevent Seoin from conducting this experiment. We will take over the specimen under our protection until this technology is proven to be safe and validated. Will Seoin agree to this? Well, that's exactly why we need you to hand over this specimen to us by any means, regardless of how you do it. And we will handle it afterwards, as we see fit, accordingly. I mean, how am I supposed to? Well, if you cannot fulfill our request, then it leaves us no other choice but to initiate the second protocol. Starting with the eradication of all the personnel and materials from this experiment. That's the only way to prevent it from being exposed to the outside world. So you know, I can't say for sure you're not on that list. So you planned to give it to the Americans from the beginning. You lied to me. That's the only way to end this quietly. And you actually trust them? They want it because they want it for themselves. Sir, one thing I know for sure is that, if this experiment is revealed, none of us will make it out. You little useless coward. If we destroy the specimen, everyone goes home happy. Please listen to me. Not happening. You think your dirty look will kill me? You think I'll sit back and watch you screw me over? What are you going to do, then? You've got the money, but that's it. Listen to me. Do as I say if you still want that sad old life of yours. This is the state affairs, and you're just a businessman. So just stay in your fucking lane! You stupid fool. - How much? - A full tank. Yes, sir. Give me some money. - Why? - We're out of gas. Pay the guy when he's done. - Can I use your restroom? - It's in the back. Can I use your phone? You still don't have their location? The search area is too big. This country has all the CCTVs in the known world. Scan every one of them and find them no matter what! Do you want a receipt? It's me. Where are you? We're on our way but Seobok vomited blood. Is that okay? He's been off his inhibitor for two days. His brainwaves must be off the charts. You need to bring him in right now, or his life's at risk. Okay. I'll get there as soon as I can. Who's he? I don't know, but the creep's been staring at us. Can't you talk? He must be a fucking mute. He's stressing me out. What? Hey! I'm talking to you! What the fuck are you? Sir, security footage from Uiseong at 1:10 p.m. Put out a search warrant. Ki-hun and the specimen are terror suspects. Shoot both on sight. But that'll put the specimen at risk of exposure. Do you have a better idea? I told you to stay put. Why won't you listen to me? You almost killed that kid! He hit me first. So what you did was right? I can't believe this... If you're just going to do as you please, then you're on your own. I'm sorry. Where are we? We'll lay low here for a while. There will be checkpoints all the way to the lab and... The lab? Hey. Hey! You need your injection or God knows what might happen! Why are you so concerned? What? I see... You need me for your life. You're right. It's for my life. So I'm begging you, okay? And why should I do that? All men die anyway. Why should you get to live? Are you worthy of being saved? You're right, every word you said. I'm not worth it. I deserve to die. But I'm doing every damn thing I can to live. Is that so wrong? Tell me! Is it so wrong to want to live? Why me? What did I do? What else should I do? Tell me! What did I do so wrong? Fuck you. You don't know anything... What do you know, you little shit? Mom, what does forever mean? It means there's no end. What's that like? Imagine there's an apple. You cut it in half and eat it, then you cut the other half in half and eat it. Then you eat half of the remaining half. Like the sun comes up in the morning and goes down at night, forever is like that. Then... what's it like to die? It's like falling into a very deep sleep forever. Open up. You have to eat all of it. Why? So you can be healthy. What do you mean why? Why should I be healthy? For me? Or for your experiment? - Stop it. - But it's true. You made me for the experiment. No, I didn't. Then why? Why did you make me, Mom? Because of Kyung-yoon? I must have dozed off... Did you put me there? Yes. And you stayed here? Yes. Why didn't you sleep? I don't sleep. I don't know how to. You've never slept in your whole life? No. Well, nothing surprises me anymore. I'm sorry. It was wrong of me to lie to you. I'm sorry. I thought you were really going to die. At this point, that would hardly be a surprise. What does it feel to be dying? Not good. - It sucks, actually. - Why? Because you're dying. Why else? Then did it feel good to live? There were good times and bad times... and definitely some shitty times. I'm confused now. I can't tell if I want to live or if I'm just scared to die. I don't know anymore. So I'm regretful. Of what? Of how I've lived my life. I've been a coward. What did they say? They told me to lay low for now. They will clean it up after a bit. It's a goddamn mess they can't clean up. I think the company ditched us. Aren't you mad at them? Why should we take the fall? It's all in here. Take it to the press or blow the whistle, but we have to reveal ourselves if we want to live. You know that. So what are you going to do? This is not what we agreed on. You said you only needed her phone. If this is to go away, someone has to take the blame. You know how this works. You fucking bastard! How can you do this? Watch who you're talking to. Would you like to take her place? If so, get in the car. You stupid coward. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. I stood there and watched. I should've been in that car. I ran... to save myself. I was scared. I was scared, so I ran. I'm sorry, Hyun-soo. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry... Take me to Imhyun church. It's in Ulsan. Please, Ki-hun. HOUSE OF BETHANY HAN KYUNG-YOON 1996 ― 2006 That's me. Kyung-yoon. And my dad. I wanted to come and see it for myself because it's the reason I was created. After Dad and I died in a car accident, Mom got sad, so she made me. She shouldn't have done that. That doesn't make me Kyung-yoon. HAN KYUNG-YOON FALLS ASLEEP ON OCTOBER 20, 2006 Do you think dying is really like sleeping? Maybe. Then how come people aren't afraid of falling asleep? It's like dying for a while. Because they'll wake up the next day. How do they know that? They just believe it. They believe they'll wake up in the morning. It scares me to think of dying. However, living forever is scary too. What should I believe to not be scared? You can cry if you feel sad. It's okay to cry. It's beautiful. What is? To be alive. Where do we go now? Well... I don't know anymore. Let's go to the lab. I have nowhere else to go. I was born there and my mom is there. That's my home. And that way, you can live too. I was born for that reason. So I will go to sleep for it too. What do you mean? You said you never sleep. Sir, we heard back from Interpol. The men are from a private military company. Mercenaries? Based in Southeast Asia, they fought in the Filipino Civil War. VIP protection, assassination... They're war thugs who take any job for money. What the hell? Stop, pull over! Request to run a plate. 36 N 5705. We located Mr. Min. - The police are on him. - Get it up on the screen. From the police black box camera, sir. Stop, 5705, 5705! Pull over! Shit! Shoot. Just Kill them all! Hey, Mr. Min. Are you okay? Good. How far will you take this? As far as I can. You leave us with no choice. Do as you will. We have guns too. You saw them earlier. Ours are foreign made. I paid a lot of money for them. I'm asking you out of genuine curiosity. Are you senile? My mind is as clear as crystal, you damn punk. You thought I wouldn't know? I knew all along. I knew from the beginning you would hand it over to the Americans. I knew Anderson was spying on us. Is that why you killed him? And you pulled off a terrorist attack using mercenaries? Quite a job, Mr. Chairman. I have a serious condition. Doctors tell me I don't have much time. I'm sitting around waiting to die. What could I be afraid of? Mom... You became a doctor because you wanted to become one. What about me? What can I become? Can I... want to become something too? Can I? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Gosh. You brought a whole army. This is your last chance. What are you going to do? This is what I'm going to do. I'm sending it to the press later. What do you think? Who would believe this? They will at least want to. Who wouldn't want to believe that you can overcome death? You believed it. It's why you brought an army. I'm not trying to save all of humanity. Why would I do that? I'll let some live and let some die. I get to make the call. What do you think? Isn't this what you call God's power? What's all this? You're up. Why didn't you rest more? We'll begin the extraction process soon. All thanks to you. We'll collect Seobok's bone marrow and extract the IPS cells. If we collect 40ml per day, we'll have one liter in a month. Then your clinical trial... You'll do this for a month? No, forever. Seobok doesn't die. But isn't that cruel? Cruel? It's like collecting insulin from a pig. Seobok isn't human. You know that. What? Don't tell me you grew attached to him. Where do we go now? Let's go to the lab. I have nowhere else to go. I was born there and my mom is there. That's my home. And that way, you can live too. I was born for that reason. So I will go to sleep for it too. Wait. I don't think this is right. What do you mean? Just stop. What is this nonsense? Are you crazy? Stop it right now. If we stop, you'll die. You know that. We're going. Do what you will. Get out, all of you! What's going on? How do you stop it? Stop the machine. Stop it now! That's enough. No one can stop this. Where is Dr. Lim? Where is she? What are you doing? Calm down and lower the gun. We preserved her body. She's the only human who has Seobok's DNA. She may be useful as well. Shit... You're all insane. If scum like you live forever, it will be a living hell. That's enough. We don't want to damage a test subject. You shouldn't have. It wouldn't have ended this anyway. Please... don't... Help... No! Don't kill him! No! Don't kill him! Don't shoot! No! Hey! Don't shoot! Grab him, you morons! Go away. Don't come near me! Open fire. I said open fire! Hey, are you all right? Are you? We need to get in the car. Run. You have to run. - To where? - What? You know. I have nowhere to go. Hey... Hey! Stop! Hey! No, stop! Go up! Climb, you idiots! That's enough, it's over. What's over? What are you doing? You'll kill them all. What's wrong with that? All men die anyway. I said stop! Why did you do it? Why did you come back when you knew everything? I wanted to become something. Something meaningful to someone. That was all. But this will never end. It'll never end as long as I live. It will only end when I'm gone. So end this for me. No... I can't. Please don't do this. Why not? Because you're scared you'll die too? But you know now. No matter how scared you are, you can never run away. Am I wrong? Right. You're right. I know now. Ki-hun. I'm sleepy.
