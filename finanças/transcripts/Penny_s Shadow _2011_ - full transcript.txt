There's a heavy storm on Ameland. When the pumping-station's whistle blows, it can only mean one thing. A ship is in distress, and the lifeboat has to go out to help. I'm fifteen years old. With my father, I get Raika out of the stable. She's needed with the other horses, to pull the lifeboat into the sea. But a piece of the bottom breaks off, and the cart sinks down several meters. The horses can't free themselves, and sink into the depths. My Raika also drowns. It's horrible. I raise the foal with a bottle. Later, she also gets a foal. Shadow. Nine years after, the horse Life boat stopped. But to remember these rescues, demonstrations are held. On the Southwest beach you can see how a boat would be launched. We're waiting for one more. They'll be here soon. It's still a grand sight to see when the horses pull that boat out to sea. Hey! Hey! Erik! Come on, hurry up. - I'm coming. Kai! Kai, use the suntan lotion. - Yes, Mom. Kai. Come on, player. Give me a hand. Yes, I'm coming. Easy, easy. I'm sunburnt, and I'm nervous. Kai! Shadow! Are we going kiting later? - Kai, come on! Yes! Hurry up! Ich geh da hin. Sind schon ein paar da? I'm not going kiting at all. - There's a crowd out there. Hundreds. Shadow! Come one! Where the hell are you? Come here and help me out. Kai! I'm coming, Mom! Mom? Tess, stop drumming. This is hard enough without the racket. How else do I practice? - You don't. Phew, we're here. Handbrake. Are you seasick yet, Rakker? You'll see us in a minute, then. Erik can put up another tent. Unless you want to join me in the camper. No. Has he read your article yet? I don't know, but I brought it. Mom, how many horses does Erik have? He did give me a tour, but all I thought was, what a nice place for a vacation. With the island, and the horses... You don't like horses. But you do. He has an 18-year-old son. Is there a picture? Boy, are you sneaky. You said you weren't interested in boys. And then you want to see the picture. What a childish remark. 'At least you can trust horses'. You were eavesdropping. Your friends talk too loud. - Mom! Tess! I'm not doing anything. You think Rakker will like it, with those other horses? Will the other horses like your midget? You're just jealous because your horse is dead. I wish you'd gone on holiday with Dad. Shall we keep it pleasant, ladies? It's beautiful here. Look. Listen, you. Cut it out. Take it easy, you jerk. Hello. - Hi. Welcome to Ameland. Thanks. Thanks for the article. - You've read it? We have shops here as well. These are my daughters. Tess and Lisa. Hi, I'm Tess. - Hi. Erik. Hi, I'm Lisa. - Hello. Is this all yours? Yes. The horses, are they over there? Ja. Hey, guys. Good boy. Here you are. Yes, that's it. Special, isn't it? She's always had it. They come to her. As if they can feel it. Ever since she was small. Can you help me? It's fine like this. Come on. Yes, that's it. Was soll das werden? What are you doing? Are you tired? Rakker. Nice. So, Erik, this is what you make. Yes. For a living? Do you like it? I think it's... special. Kai. Come over here. Our guests are here. Can you give them a tour? You know Daphne. This is Tess... Hi! Tess. - Hi. And that's Lisa. - Hi. So you're the loudmouth. Hey, Kai, where are you going? To polish my kiteboard. The band will be here soon. - I know. He obviously likes you a lot. Tess! That's how boys act when they do. Cut it out. Sorry, I don't know what's up. I'm afraid Lisa bawled him out, because he was pulling at a horse. - Shadow? He hit him. That's ridiculous. Lisa. You saw it too, Mom. Boy, oh boy... I'm coming with you. Lisa! Hey! Will you keep following me? I want to check on Rakker. He's over there. By the way, when you interviewed me, a museum called. Remember? They want my stuff. - Really? Wow, that's great. Congratulations. Thanks. Noch eine Tasse Tee? That's nice. Another cup of tea? Have you seen this? This is the rooms I can use at the Groninger museum. And I'd put the furniture like this. Oh yes, that looks good. And what's over here? Well... I wanted to call you about old photographs. But at the same time I thought, the article is about now, so... Shadow is just a few years old there. But she already won a prize with him. We've tried everything, but he gets more mistrustful. He won't wear a bit, and riding him is out. The vet says he's becoming more irrational. Dangerous to people, even But getting rid of him is another thing. Was that you in the road just now? Easy. No need to be afraid. You get scared when I look at you, right? I'm Lisa. Come to me. Get away. Get away from there. Why? Shadow, get back. Back. That was stupid. - Me? You were shouting! Is the stable open a lot? I could get close, and pet him. He only lets me and Dad get close. And you just walk in? You could have been killed. Sorry. He's afraid of strangers. He can only come out when it's quiet. I'm trying to get him accustomed to it, but it doesn't work. I can help you. Stay out of it, he's not your horse. It's too dangerous. I can feel something in him. What? It's not so much his body... If you touch him... I'm just trying to help. Don't get so worked up. What, me? - Yes, you. Lisa? Lisa! Lisa! There are new guests here! And a really cool band. Thanks for the lift, guys. No problem. Don't push me. Sneaking off to the barn? Cut it out. - Are you in love already? shut up, Tess. Look. And Mom only let me take my practice pad. Ask if you can play. I'm scared. - Then I will. Guys... I'll kill you if you do. You all came out of that van? I'm so slim.. Jorine. I'm Kai. Welcome to the campsite. I'm Tess. I'm here with my sister. Lisa. Hey! Unload your stuff, then I'll show you the sleeping quarters. Follow me. Right, this is my bed. Hey, Chantal? - Yes? Can I lie under you? You can't handle it, you're much too immature. Funny. The boys will sleep on the other side. One of these days... I swear I'll kill you. Tess, your dog... Rakker! How did you get here? Everyone here? Ok, listen up. If the weather's nice, like today, we can eat out here. But please clean up your stuff. You've seen the dorms, where you'll all sleep. We also have tents. Look out, a ball. There are campers... Do you like it here? Sure. That doesn't sound wildly enthusiastic. No, should it? Of course not, but... Well, then. You're right, I shouldn't pry. Mom, please don't go into mother and daughter mode. That's what my column's about. Should you let your daughter be? I've used you as an example. I didn't mention your name. Just, what to do if she has trouble concentrating and wants to be a doctor. Do you pressure her... Everyone will know it's me. No, of course not. You want to become a vet. that's totally different. I'm sorry. You can pick a horse yourselves. Cleaning things are over there. If you haven't ridden much... Will you help them? Privately? Don't jump the queue. We had a deal. Don't be silly. We're here for the horses. Check your girth well. It's a nice day, so wipe the sweat off with a sponge and water. You can go anywhere in here, but not behind that chain. Why not? Hey, little one. What a nice pony. Did you know Kai has a girlfriend? What did she say? It's Rakker. Erik says Kai's not so bad. What's that jerk to me? Maybe he's nicer than you think. It's hard, without a mother. I don't have a father. But he's still alive. You can see him whenever you want to. Even if you don't want to. - Naturally. I can understand you're mad at him. You shouldn't go there alone. You could go with Tess. Let Tess suck up to him by herself. He's dead to me. Lisa! She acts like it's normal he left us. Tess is just as sad about it as you are. How did Kai's mother die, by the way? She was hit by a car when she got Shadow out of the trailer. That's what I felt. I felt something, with Shadow. What a funny contraption. I can't ride for too long. But he's my super-shetland. - Are you too heavy? No, but my legs might be too long. Why the band? For the Beachcomber Festival. Great. And because Erik ir organizing it we can stay and rehearse here. Cool, right? And the girls? We gave them a lift. - They're horse forum friends? I'd be careful then. Why? Dangerous brides. Kai, have you got a minute? Can you give Jorine a leg up? I can manage myself. "I can manage myself." Is everyone ready? Shouldn't you pick a horse? I'll just watch, for now. Put on your riding hats. Jorine, aren't you wearing one? I don't want to mess up my hair. Put it on. It's not optional. Do you wanna ride with us or not? Where were you? Mom wanted some quality time with me. Get on your horses. We'll hit the road first. We'll ride single file. Later in the dunes we'll have lots of room. Okay, let's do it. Let's go, come on. All together. A little faster, please. Pay attention. We're going to trot. Are we doing okay? Good. Nice ass. No, Rakker. Stop. What are you doing? Rakker! Stop that. What are you doing? Rakker likes paprika chips. "Rakker likes paprika chips." Come on. It's going well, guys. Stay together. Take it easy. Stop! Help! Help me! Stop! Come here, easy. I'll help you. Help me, please. I got you. Easy. Jorine, are you alright? They can't handle much, can they? - Stupid animal. It's not the animal's fault. Come! You've been riding before, haven't you? Yes. You too, right? Normally, she has to get used to it. But with you, it seems easy. Your sister brought her Shetland. Don't you have a horse of your own? My horse died. She was a lot like Shadow. The same build, the same bearing. I think we can cure Shadow. If we... We just have to... Don't touch him, I said. Okay. Fine. You're the only one who can hit him. What are you doing? Look out, man. Why were you so uptight? What do you mean? Didn't you see me lying there? Right, sorry. Yeah, right. - I said I was sorry. Nice friend you are. Look out. He's mine. Hey, Kai. Do you know them? Yes, they're staying with us. It's a contest. The blonde's mine, the brunette yours. Or vice versa. Hey, ladies. Can I join you? I'm Anthony, a friend of Kai's. Hey, ladies. I'm Ralf. Hi. - I'm his brother Little brother. Now beat it, squirt. So, who are you? Ask Kai. Yes, Kai. Tell us their names. What did I say? Buzz of. You really want to know? That's Chantal, and that's Jorine. She sometimes runs wild, but otherwise she's okay. Thank you, Kai. Hey! Hello! Come here. Are you a good boy? I've got something for you. Come on. Don't you want it? Hey! Yes, that's enough. Thank you. He, Erik! - Not too late, okay? Lights out at midnight, we know. The island boys can smell it... when new girls have arrived. You never had that, did you? Don't get me started. Like father, like son? Kai... Hey, sweetheart? Hey buddy. Shouldn't you join the boys? Yes, I should. In a minute. Mom would like it if you started drawing again. I'll never be that good. I think we should clear out this room. Well, there's no hurry. Kai! That wasn't very clever this afternoon, was it? Loudmouth. - She started it. They're guests. I talked to our guest since then. Good. What does she want? You like her mom, so you don't want her to complain? What's that supposed to mean? I wouldn't know. You? This is the idea, more or less. The bridge has to be much tighter. Talk to Klaas. Are we ready for something snappier? Yeah! I said, are we ready for something snappier? Let's go. Hit the road, Klaas. Why don't you ask if you can play? It's a nice, big kit. I don't know. "If she doesn't run wild, she's okay." You don't say things like that. No. But you're too suspicious. And Jorine... we're on holiday. I say, party time. Come on. Watch and learn, I'd say. Okay. Hey. Hey. Would you like to dance? No. But my sister dances very well. Ask her. Lisa, don't be stupid. Hey. I'm Ralf. Tess. Shall we dance? No, I'm listening to the band. Want a jelly bean? No, thanks. Then what? Hey Tess. I saw you, you know. Come and play. No. But I have an idea for your song. Let's hear it, then. You don't ride, do you? I will if you'll play. Enough about horses. Play the drums, little one. No, let me go. Let me go! Let me go, you idiot. Show us what you can do. My drums. I told you I didn't want to. She did say that, yes. Rakker! Rakker! It's so stupid. I was just too scared. Easy! Come here. What is it, Shadow? Don't be afraid. Here's an apple. Take a bite. Would you like that? Lisa, what are you doing? You're not allowed... Not so loud! Easy. Hey. Good boy. What is it? You see? It's not so bad, is it? I've made contact. But he's terribly wild. Kai says no one can ride him. I can. He's eaten a piece of my apple. You won't go on, will you? Sure, it may take a little effort, and it won't be easy. But Shadow will get better. And what does Kai think? He doesn't know. Just shut up. - What? Just don't say anything. Let him fool around with the girls and that kiteboard. That's more important than his horse. Do you like him? Hello. Jelly bean? Yes, great. I don't think this is a good idea. But you promised. This thing is huge. Relax, and exude confidence. You can do it. Foot in the bag. The other foot. Or you'll be the wrong way around. You can do it, Klaas. Very good. Comje on. Come on. Swing your leg over it. I've got it. You can handle the rest, right? Aren't you coming, Lisa? We're also going surfing and kiting. I've got things to do. But I can come afterwards. Erik asked me to go flying with him. Flying? Yes, we can join a flight to Groningen. That's nice. You should go. Tell Erik I'll watch his farm. We'll be back this afternoon. Good. So, we're all alone now. Not so fast, guys. Hey, Tess, what did you want to say about the song? How about feelings for a horse? Feelings for my ass, you mean. Hey. What do you want? Do you want to go outside? Rakker, Rakker, stop! Rakker, no. Stop that. Don't, Rakker. We have to save him. No, wait. Let him be. Let him be. Let him sniff. See. Shadow likes your little one. I'd take him inside before Kai returns. Why did you let him out? He never gets to run free. He only does things with Kai. I can see why he's afraid of people. But Kai will find out. Don't tell him, okay? Of course not. But if you ever make a nasty remark about Rakker again... Then you'll...? You know. I'll never make a nasty remark again. Would Erik be right for Mom? We'd get a free place to spend our holidays. You're completely nuts. Come on. Come, move it. Hey Klaas, how are you? Ow, my ass. I can hardly walk. Then why don't you ride? On a horse, for instance. Very funny. Behave yourself. Good morning, guys. Kai, hurry up. We're going kiting. Coming. What's the matter? Didn't you sleep well? Yes, that's right. There's Ralf. Hey, Lisa! - Hey, Anthony! Everything okay? - I'm fine, and you? I'm fine. Hello? Am I invisible or something? Sorry. Hey Tess, how are you? How are you, Tess. Fine. You want to play volleyball? Me? - Okay. Are you having a good time? Wait up, Kai. Again this afternoon? Give me that. Alright, Shadow, shall we try it? Come on. Yes, good boy. Are you ready? Easy, Shadow. Easy. What's the matter? Easy. Yes, very good. Come on. Very good. Good boy. Rakker, go away. Good morning. Good morning. It's very late. Lisa! Lisa? Lisa? Mom, leave me alone. Rakker is loose. - He's my alarm clock. I'm going for a ride with Erik. A ride? You? Yes. Which horse do you always ride, Lisa? Mabel. I'll take another one, then. Erik can sneak into the nature reserve. In love? Sneaking around with him? You and your fantasies. Hey. Are you alright? Yes, hi. The girls are still sleeping. Not interested in their mother. Which one should I take? Follow your instinct. My instinct? Just choose one. Dad. - Yes? You're wanted on the phone. - I'll be right there. Okay, then I'll... Just pick one. Hey, and who are you? You look a lot like Blacky. DO NOT ENTER Hey. Come here! Come here! Erik! Hurry! No! Help me! Oh God! - Get me out of here. Shadow! Shadow! Listen to me. Get out. Get lost! Damn horse. - I'm alright. Mom? Whay happened? It's okay. It's okay. Oh dear! Let me see. Are you alright? Yes, fine. Can you move your arm a little? Fine. So much for my gut instinct. Didn't you see the chain? - What chain? Du hättest tot sein können, Mam. Was für eine Kette? You could have been killed. I think I forgot to put it back when I went to Shadow. I rode him. Last night. Impossible. - It's true. Again, you've seen the problem. That animal is dangerous. I'm sorry. I kept him, in memory of your mother. Though everyone said it was impossible. Kai, this is enough. Does he have to go? You heard Erik. He's dangerous. Shadow's not crazy. Just scared. This is between Erik and Kai. Lisa, please. Kai, you can ride him. If I can, so can you. You have to believe me. Trust me. The accident just now, that's not his fault. I forgot to put the chain back. He can't help it. You know I was able to touch Shadow. I went to him every day. At night as well. What? For how long? Is that why you're beat each morning? He can be trusted. I can show you. Please. Let me prove it. I don't like this at all. Me neither, but who knows... Come on. Aren't the others awake yet? Quiet. They must be upstairs. I'll look. You have to talk to him, Kai. You have to give him your trust. Make contact with him. It's me. I'm really sorry about everything. Hey boy. Shadow, it's alright. It's alright. Easy. It's alright. This is the first time since the accident. Come on, Kai. We're going kiting. Hey, isn't that the wild horse? I think so. - Yes, it is. Lisa's done it. - What? She's tamed Shadow. Wow! Jelly bean? Hey. Kai. I don't get it. We've been trying for years, and then you come along. I've got an idea. We have to keep on training Shadow. You could do it, or I could. Anyway, I've got a plan. What is it? Shadow is going to be in the lifeboat demonstration. He got my mother killed. Go on, blame your horse. - You always have these great ideas. In this case, yes. Okay, whatever. Lisa! A circle. Go around in circles. That's it. Hey, Tess. I'm starting to enjoy sitting on this Belgian. Are you okay? Listen to this. Listen to this. It's different from what you do. Cobra. My horse likes it too. Listen, horsie. This is awesome, right? Are you alright? I think he prefers light pop. Oh no. The fat Belgian obviously doesn't like Black Cobra. Go, big boy. Are we ready? - Yes. Let's go. One... two.... One, two, three, four. What's better than being young? We're still young too. - You are? Erik? - Yes? There's a lifeboat demonstration at the Festival. I think it's a good idea if Shadow joins in. He'll be among people again. We have to keep at it now. Oh? - Yes. You think so? Kai, come here. What's your take on Shadow? I don't understand. - Do you trust him? She can do what she wants with him. We were talking about the demo. Would you want Shadow to join? Kai? Do you? Please say yes. Yes? You'll have to train pretty hard. It'll be fine. Hey. Fantastic. Come. Let's go, Shadow. Are you coming? - I'm busy. Good boy. Good boy. - You've been doing this for days. I'm not here for you. Go with Rakker. My cart has a flat. Then fix it. Or ask your boyfriend. Lisa! - I'm busy. Why are you always so mean to me? - What? I can never do right. If I visit Dad, you think I'm crazy. Just like now. The horse is more important than I am. Come. Come here. She's fantastic, isn't she? She trains him day and night. She didn't even want to come. On the power boat. You didn't ask me? You go all the time. When are we going? - We're not, for the time being. She's really cool. And pretty as well. Yeah, sure. What's with you? Why? Nothing at all. I just don't want to hear your crap. Kai. Hey, Kai, wait up. Is it going smoothly, Lisa? Come, Shadow! ♪ without words, you tell me everything ♪ without words ♪ without words, you get so much closer ♪ without words, in your eyes I can find That sounded good, Tess. A bit like our new song. Need a band? Oh, you... Where's your cart? Flat tire. Then let someone help you. I can't. I need a doctor. Cry baby. I think he's completely ready. She can twist him around her finger. Would you have preferred it if I said no? I... If you really don't want this, we won't do it, okay? No, that's not it. But it's all getting so close. I know. Mom would love this. She was so proud of him. Remember? Yes. I'll help them set up at the Sunsetclub. - Yes. I'll go with you. ♪ without words, you're getting so much closer ♪ without words, you tell me everything Something like that? - I think so. I'm going to help Klaas get to a doctor. Be back in time. Okay, Mr. Lennon? ♪ without words, you tell me everything ♪ without words, you get so much closer That sounds good, Tess. Is your sister coming? No, she just wants to practice. It's cool that Shadow can join. Who's going to play the drums tonight? Good question. Tess can do it. Don't be stupid. I can't. What did the doctor say? Go to the hospital on the mainland. We'll take the water taxi. It will be the fastest way. Who's going to play the drums? If it's not too painful... Just use the bass drum. Or you'll have to play more rhythmically. What is it? Close the door! She's gone, stupid thing. Stop whining. Today's the big day, boy. We'll show them something. Come on. Put him over there. Here? - Over there.. Here? - Yes. He's raring to go, isn't he? Absolutely. Right, Shadow? You can see better like this, right? - That's her alright. There's Lisa. Shadow? Shadow. Easy. Relax, Shadow. Easy. Shadow. This is Johan. - Blow that whistle. No, Shadow! Shadow. Shadow. Shadow. Let's go. Come on. We have to look for him. Kai. Is he your horse? He reared up when my mother died. When I find him, I'll have him put down. Kai. No. Shadow. Shadow. Shadow. Shadow. Lisa. Lisa. Tess, Sorry. I screwed up. - No, Lisa. I did. Let me be, I'll be there in a minute, okay? What do you think? We'll put him down. No. No, mom. He's not yours. It's mean. Kai hates Shadow. That's not true. It is. You tell everyone the accident was his fault. It was probably yours. Was that necessary? - He's mean. So were you. - You're defending him? This is really hard on the boy. Go ahead, take Kai's side. Kai, it's the spray can. Remember Jorine's horse being startled? A guy was using sun tan lotion. It's the spray can. - What are you on about? It's a combination. From the past. What's it to you? Get lost. I'm going to look for him. You said he reared up. He did it again. Maybe it's a memory. I'm sure. You're so sure about everything. Your mother. When she was killed... was there a steam whistle? Don't talk nonsense. Listen to me. Maybe a cloud covered the sun... or a shadow scared him. Shadow's got a trauma, and it makes him crazy. Listen to me. Horses get upset easily. You know that. We have to teach Shadow... that these things are not connected. Kai! Come on. Foot. Very good, very good. Hey, Tess! You know we're playing at the Festival. But Klaas has a bad wrist. You can really play, and you want to. According to Ralf. I don't know... Can you fill in tonight? Can we discuss this some other time? Lisa, where are you going? Looking for Shadow. - Lisa. Hey, Ralf. Hey, Tess! I'm going to look for the horse. Do your thing. Yes. Have you seen Lisa? No. What's up? - No, no, I'll find her. Why do you talk to the band about me? What do you mean? That I can play well. - It's true. Not in a rock band, moron. In a brass band. Is that with one drum? Shadow! Shadow! Shadow! Shadow! He! Hey, boy. I'm so glad you're back. It's going to be alright. Oh my... Lisa? You know, what happened back then, with the accident... it was like it happened again... - You don't have to tell me. It wasn't Shadow's fault. But it wasn't your fault either. Welcome to the Ameland beachcomber festival In a minute, at the Beachcomber Festival, the band Spiritz. Until then, I'm Colin Banks, playing you my music. Right, guys. And, is it busted? Broken. Shit. Now what? I don't know if I dare. Sure you do. You know the songs, you're good... And Lisa says you're good. - I'm good at looking a fool. You're great. - It's not that simple. Just do the songs you know. The guys will follow you. Like Without Words. You know that. Come on, Tess. Nein. I'm sure you can do it. Are we going to do it, or not? Are you sure you're going home tomorrow? I have to work. Of course, I could come back the day after. That's a pretty good idea. Ladies and gentlemen, here's Theo Pijpers. Hello everyone! Welcome to the first Beachcomber Festival... on Beachcomber Night. We are now going to watch and enjoy Spiritz. Good evening Ameland. Are you ready for a party? Yeah. That's what I like to hear. Unfortunately, our drummer has broken his wrist. We have a replacement, but... I'm not sure she's going to play. Maybe you could help us? Tessie, Tessie, Tess... Yes, there she is. Come on, you can do it. Go on. Here we go! The first song we're going to play is our new single, Without Words.
