Well, gentlemen, there was once a Spanish town. An ordinary little town. And it happened that one morning... precisely this morning... when the... but no... I think you should familiarize yourselves with its houses, its inhabitants and its customs before the occurrences... well... the occurrences that are going to happen in a few moments. Wouldn't it be better to stop them for a few minutes? It's easy. And as you can see, this town is nothing in particular. Look at the plaza. Excuse me... Perhaps this way there are less distractions. The things that are most important happen here... the dances, the market, the bullfights, the moonlit nights. The fountain is an antique, and the water that flows from it is good and fresh. The church is pretty old. I think it dates from 1003... ...well, it really is pretty old, and those who know assure us that it has great value. This is the City Hall, with its balcony and everything, so that the Mayor can give his eloquent speeches. And this is the clock. It is not really 3:10. It is broken, and of course until there are funds to fix it... Here is the school. A little small, true, but since it's for children without demanding parents, it serves, the same as that map of Europe, sweet and optimistic, where the Austro-Hungarian Empire still exists. And this is an ordinary house of an ordinary man, of a man probably named Juan. And there is a table, a chair, a bed, a blanket, just like everywhere... Why continue? You can also see the Café. It's also the grand casino, the universal inn, a cabaret with entertainment and the bus station. The bus runs between Villar Del Campo, where the railway station is, and Villar Del Rio, which has none. Now you more or less know the town. Here you are again. I will introduce you to the most important people: The one unloading is Genaro, the bus driver, but perhaps he's a bit far away. Now you can see him better. In that sack is the movie that will be shown on Saturday, and I think it's a western - the horses, the bullets... but forgive me, Genaro, that sack must weigh a lot. Genaro learned to drive in the war in a tank, that's why once in a while he goes off the road. That package is for Don Pablo, who in spite of his deafness is the owner of the Café, the cabaret, the casino, the inn, Genaro and half the town. And in his spare time, he's also the Mayor. He's here to personally meet Carmen Vargas, the most famous Andalusian singer, who has come accompanied by her band and Manolo, the one with the bag. He is agent, mentor, pianist and lady-in-waiting to the famous songstress of Andalusian repertoire. José is the postmaster, not that José is someone who you'd want to follow through the streets, but little by little we will meet more interesting people. For example, in these towns, the most important person is always the priest. The one from Villar Del Rio, Don Cosme, is sympathetic and easy-going. Every week for many years he has received an issue of Roses and Thorns, and he enjoys it very much, even though sometimes he's not in agreement with the main article. This boy, being punished by having to hold his arms in the shape of a cross for not knowing who was killed at Jericho, and those children with their tongues hanging out, are the students of Miss Eloisa, and that obnoxious child with the glasses without his tongue hanging out is Pepito, best student in the class, whiz kid in natural history. Miss Eloisa, the teacher, is very cute, she's very nice, she's very smart... but she's still single. Even though it's spring, she never makes a multiplication error. I forgot to show you the most exalted house in town, that of Don Ruiz. He's the most aristocratic person in town, but he has no money. He's always waiting for a letter that never arrives. His ancestors forget to write to him, obviously. The barber shop is the social center of the Villar Del Rio Football Club, that this year plans to ascend to the first group of the second category of the third class of the regional category, even though this gentleman, Don Emeliano, the town doctor, shows an inhuman indifference to those things, despite the fact that he's in the hands of the passionate barber and also in the company of this other arguing gentleman, who is the pharmacist and also the president of the Football Club, who could care less about anything not related to football, except, of course, keeping tabs on the Mayor, who, being friendly with the artists after getting them rooms at the Inn, is giving them a tour of the outskirts, so they can see his holdings, an activity considered scandalous by Doña Raquel and Doña Matilde, organizers of the clothing collections for the poor children, and the official gossips of Villar Del Rio. Don Pedro, the fat owner of the fabric store, could tell you in 3 minutes everyone in the town who's going to hell, in no uncertain terms. And now I'm going to introduce you to Geronimo. Excuse me, I'd like to introduce you to Geronimo, the secretary of City Hall. At the moment he's resolving a difficult problem of the municipal budget, in reference to the acquisition of some mules and repairs to the clock. Have you lost something? Do you want to exchange an alarm clock for cough syrup? Julian, the town crier, will happily announce whatever you want sold, or keep you abreast of what's happening. Now he's ready to announce that Eulalia, from the mill, has lost the glasses she wears for knitting socks. But that's of no interest to the perennially unemployed, those who sit in the plaza thinking about the harvest they've never had. Well, now, I think that's all. The rest of the neighbors, including Juan and Rafael, are working in the fields. Rafael is always late for everything. Well, I'll introduce them later. Now you have an idea of the town and its people, so it is time to continue with our story. It's morning, almost 11, spring. Everything is OK, neither bad nor good. Everything is as usual, but today... We have to find the Mayor! - But who are those men? - The General. - Mamma Mia! - They must've found everything out! I'm going for the Mayor. Fix up whatever you can. Take the bike, you'll get there faster. I'll tell the whole town. Hurry up, there's no time to lose! - What's going on? - I don't know, a General has arrived. Maria! Maria! - Indubitably it's the war - But what war? - The war, gentlemen, the war. Haven't you seen the helmets of the motorcycle riders? - But the war against who? - Well, that is not really known yet. It has been decided in different conversations. Miss Eloisa! The Principal! Maria! Maria, the Delegate! - Hey, you, tell Inez. - Inez, Inez! Hurry up, the Delegate has come. Go tell the priest! Don Cosme, the Delegate! We have to tell the people! Let's go! Can't you keep those kids quiet? Look, dummies, it's easy. Again... "The harvest has been bad, the harvest has been bad." Since the harvest has been so good, then we will plant again... - Are you listening? - Yes, I understand. The bells, the bells... Let's go, come on. Don Pablo, stop! - Don Pablo. - What's up? You have to return immediately, we are lost! - Why? - They're waiting for you at City Hall. - They're waiting for you! - Eh? - At City Hall! - Who is at City Hall? The General Delegate. General? The General Delegate! The Delegate? Yes, I, in person. At your service, Senor Delegate. You're probably tired, please do me a favor and sit down. Thank you, but I'm fine standing up. How are you? No, no, no, no need to be formal, my dear Mr. Mayor. Evidently my visit is a great surprise to you and from what I have been able to ascertain, also for the whole town. But of course, everything is in order... both the wheat harvest and the sheep harvest... they haven't been as good as usual because of the hail. Please, my good friend, you know that you have always enjoyed my absolute confidence. No, this beautiful town is one of my favorites, and I have always dreamt of spending a vacation in Villar Del Campo. Del Rio. Of course, of course, Del Rio, naturally. Well, Mr. Mayor, I am paying a personal visit to these places of this noble province to bring good news. - The railroad? - What railroad? It's that once you spoke from the balcony about the railroad... And I'm reiterating, Mr. Mayor, I always repeat that about the railroads. And precisely this good news that I have come to bring to you, it is in a certain way related to the railroad, so necessary to this noble town of Villar Del Campo. Del Rio... Right, Del Rio... as its name indicates. Well, then, my esteemed Mr. Mayor, I have come to communicate that in a short time there will be a visit from some good friends... the representatives of a great town... who are willing to help their less fortunate brothers. Those friends, Mr. Mayor, are the North Americans. Exactly... the delegates to Spain for the program of European recuperation. The European Recovery program. Simply, the Marshall Plan. My visit, then, Mr. Mayor, is to announce to you the arrival of these comrades, and I am advising you that it is of extreme importance to welcome them warmly. And what should I do to receive them? All that which is opportune, my dear friend. The thing is, we want them to be satisfied. Then I will give them some lemonade. No, no, no lemonade, please. Sangria at the Café? No, no, that's not what we mean, dear friend, the town must be on fire with celebration. - Ah, yes. - Fireworks. Children with flags. And you should speak to them from the balcony. - Talk about what? - About everything. Of the town, of the agriculture, of the stock, of the commerce, - of the industry. - What industry? Well, don't worry, they only speak English, they won't understand anyway. Alright, alright, I'm beginning to understand. The important thing is that you make a speech, that the town is celebrating. Especially that there will be kids with flags. And don't you forget that they have dollars. Of course, of course. Well, that's it. I was sure about you and this magnificent town. Then what about the railroad? You receive them as they deserve. They're very generous, and when they come they will bring enough railroads to stop the trains. You will send me a telegram before they come? You will receive the news in plenty of time. So, that's all. I'm leaving very satisfied with our conversation. Our mutual agreement is very satisfactory. Mr. Mayor, make use of me as you would a friend, and I'm very sorry your harvest was so bad because of the hail. But that shouldn't worry you now. - Sir... sir... - Mr. Mayor... Have a good trip, Mr. Delegate. And company... - Don't forget my observations. - My missions? ...don't you forget my observations. Oh, yeah, yeah, don't worry. I have confidence in you and this noble town of Villar Del Campo. Del Rio! Sit down, Mr. Mayor, sit down, just like you would at your own home. - Well, what do you think about the girl? - Ah, the girl... Very pretty, very pretty. - And how does she sing? - Ah, does she sing well? What do you mean, does she sing well? She's a prodigy of nature! Her voice is supernatural! Listen, what do you think of her as a person? Who knows? But does the girl have talent or not? I'm sure she does. What going on it that you're worried about that guy who came here. And you haven't noticed the strength of your feelings. What I have noticed is her legs! They don't even look like they're from a human being. Are they not hers? - Ahh, what a joke, Mr. Mayor! - Yeah, I'm a big joker. The audience is impressed. You have obtained for your theater a supernatural artist, unique in her genre! The Americans are going to build a railroad to the front of your house just to hear her sing. Just because you're so agreeable, I'm going to help you.. aren't you happy? Help me? To do what? What? Listen, girl, here, this gentleman who of course is very pleased with your art and your talent, wants to prolong our contract, and he doubts that I can help him to welcome the Americans. - Explain to him who I am. - Sure. Who knows the Americans better than I do? Who spent 15 years in Boston organizing international spectacles that were always pleasing to the respectable public who filled the halls. - Explain that to him, girl. - Sure. - You see? - Yeah, sure. - After what the girl has said... - It's the truth! Because I know the Americans just like I had seen them being born, and because I know their likes and dislikes. Listen, sir... If you make me an offer like a gentleman deserves, I will swear to you on my mother's salvation that I will make such a reception for those guys that the Delegate will fill your lapel with decorations and the town will think that the Magi have arrived from the gifts they will receive. What do you think? Ah, but it is because the Americans... that the American's don't give things? Girl, explain it to him. - Oh, sure. - There, you've heard it. And even though she never likes to exaggerate that the Americans give away things... All the same... It is better to receive than to give, but when you do not know the intentions of the donor, you should not take any gifts. That's what I tell my wife all the time. Because invisible but evil, the enemy can appear on a horse with those gifts. Yes, you can't trust the animals. I am starting to doubt everything. And that's what we were talking about. I can only imagine the diverse ways of evil. Yes, friends... evil sends us its messengers. And does anyone know, who are those Americans? Indians! Indians! Gaspar De Arce Alonzo De Quesada! First Quesada of the branch of the Arces. He crossed with 300 horsemen from Yucatan to Florida. The Indians ate him up. My good relative Guillermo Cabral De Ximenez, traversed the west coasts of Mexico and crossed California to the Llano Estacado. The Indians ate him up. Don Felipe and Don José. Sons of my paternal grandfather. They fought for the Texans and their independence. I suppose that the Indians also ate them up? No, then there were no Indians, but their children were still there. Did you know that a pretender of my aunt Margarita lost his whole hacienda at the hands of the Yankees? The Yankees? Yes, my dear friend, the Yankees. Did you not know there was a war between the North and the South? An internecine war. Don't forget, I'm a pharmacist, of course I know that. And the Cuban war... well, dear friend, when they come bearing gifts it will not be my hand that opens up. That's what we've come to, those Americans... who are they, those Americans? Those are the inhabitants of the United States. The United States borders on the north with Canada. On the south with Mexico, on the east with the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west with the Pacific Ocean. Its area is 16 times the area of Spain. And its population of 151 million inhabitants is 5 times the amount of the population of Spain. Its capital is Washington, 1,500,000 inhabitants. About the economy, it is interesting to know that the United States is the largest producer of iron and steel, with 200 million annual tons. The largest producer of petroleum, with 300 million annual tons, the largest producer of cotton, with 4 million tons annually, the largest producer of lead, with... ...ahem.. with... - 800 thousand tons. - 800 thousand tons annually. The largest producer of pigs, 500,000 heads annually. - The largest producer of... - Of sins, with millions of tons annually! There are 49 million Protestants, 400,000 Indians, 200,000 Chinese, 5 million Jews, 13 million Negroes, and 10 million of nothing! And what? Do you plan to remain with your arms crossed hoping to receive things from them without anything in exchange? For every grain of wheat, for every ton of coal, there is a soul to save. Because to them, they will have an excess of locomotives, but we have an excess of something else... of the spirit! And that should be our gift. And do you know, by chance, that there were a million divorces in the United States in one year? 7,000 murders, 17,000 rapes, 80,000 armed robberies, and 60,000 robberies with injuries. After all this, what do you think America is going to give us? More things for more towns, faster. He said also that the plan to help Europe would not cease, but would increase. So, in the last few months there has been received in France 5,000 tractors, 10,000 jeeps, 100,000 tons of Manitoban wheat from Canada, and at least 80 locomotives. See, see, gentlemen, the pleasant trip of one of them. Did it get seasick? The program of goodwill towards Europe will continue. And after the symbolic presentation to the mayor of Naples of the 500th shipment of goods the delivery of materials to the Italian public will resume with increased frequency. Atlantic City... The western movie... remember? It's almost over. As usual, the good guys have arrived on time. The boy and the girl kiss. Yes, it's the end. Well, there they are. But tonight, no one will stop to discuss the picture. Nobody will ask anyone if they enjoyed it. No. Not tonight. Tonight everyone is very silent. With a strange look. With a head full of... how should I say... full of things. You can imagine what's happening. Since the Honorable Delegate's visit, the town is a bit shaken up. Yes, something strange is going on. The things they have seen and heard have changed them a bit. Some of them walk the streets as if in a dream. Or all of a sudden a young woman starts staring at the moon. To Don Ruiz, who delights in the murmurings of his terrible ancestors. "El perro"... the dog. "La Casa"... "Una Casa"? "La Casa"... the house, Miss. And Manolo, who announces and manages the greatest star of the Andalusian repertoire. What damsel in distress will Don Pablo save? The western movie enthusiast. What ideas and what illusions haunt others? What misconceptions will they bring? What will people accept from them? There are few lights burning. Marcial's will be the last one out. It seems that the little boy is somewhat of a night owl. It's of no account. That's it. Listen. Listen to the silence. The hour. In conclusion, the town is a little bit on edge. I ask myself, what will happen? What marvelous things are on the verge of occurring? I am curious to know how this all ends. Well, let's allow these good people to sleep. Till tomorrow afternoon, when they'll be a dance on the plaza. The Americans? Listen, you... the Americans, from where? Three, four... Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor! The Americans are here! How can they be here?! - The Americans? For sure! - Let's go! Girl, show yourself so the Americans can see you. Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, are we ready? Oh, noble American people! - What did you say? - I said, noble American people! - You're nuts! - What do you mean, I'm nuts? Because we're not Americans. And what are you doing here, then? And what the hell do you care? You're speaking to the Mayor! Be careful! Listen, you have to treat the Mayor with more respect. Yeah, sure, sure. We're the crew that fixes the highways. You know, we're from the Department of Public Works. And so what? We are fixing up the road for when the Americans come. And all these little flags, all these decorations, all these silly things... why? We are dressed up in case they show up. But are they coming so soon? Oh, yeah, you have to have the whole town prepared. The town prepared? I believe so. That's the truth. Look, have you guys seen them? Naturally, when they let themselves be seen. Have they gone through Jaraque? Through Jaraque, through Alora, through Villa Gordo... They went through Villa Gordo? Villa Gordo... ooo! But they're not explaining anything. It's all very secret. And also, we have a schedule. You can do whatever you want in this town... But I am advising you, there is no time to lose, Mr. Mayor! What are you doing, standing there, idiot? Go immediately and tell the town crier that in 2 hours everyone should meet at City Hall. Move! Good. Let's go! I say, dear friends... get me a chair... that our town cannot remain with their arms crossed while the rest of the towns prepare to make a great welcome for the Americans. Something has to be done. And in order to do something, something must be done. And in order to do something I need everyone's collaboration. - Very well. - Eh? - Very well! - Ah, thank you very much. And I have to tell you that since the Delegate's visit, I have not slept a wink. So that tells you the problems that this situation presents. And nothing has come to mind. Hey, listen... close the window so we can understand each other. Nothing? Nothing? Nothing! Not a thing. Besides the flags and the kids, nothing. Nevertheless, Mr. Mayor, I think the problem is fairly simple. - I also think so. - And I - And I. Well, well, then let me have your ideas. Well, for example... for example, we could display banners. I am opposed to displaying banners with our colors to welcome the Indians. - Very good! - Thank you. In my opinion, I think that it would be better to build at the entrance of the town, a triumphal arch - with a sign that says... - That says what? That says... hello. I firmly oppose construction of a triumphal arch at the entrance of the town to welcome the Americans. Very well! What if we organize some pretty fireworks? All the other towns have probably already thought of that. How about a sack race? That's stupid, my friend, that is really stupid. What about a fair? What about if the women threw flowers at their feet? I won't have our women throwing flowers at those gentlemen! I also concur. A moment, gentlemen.. Without disparaging all the magnificent ideas that have been presented, my opinion is that you have forgotten something. - Something? - What? Our fountain. Our magnificent fountain in the plaza. What's happening with the fountain? Well, the first thing is to make it more noticeable to install a mechanism to make the water shoot up higher and inside the water install a couple of electric bulbs with a double filament of luminescence. And then? That due to solar reflection and the double effect of the luminescent arch over the areas that are not transparent, sometimes the fountain cap will glow blue, or green, or red. The idea of the cap sounds good to me. Well, those kinds of things are what those people really like. Well, Don Emeliano, nevertheless, you have forgotten something. What do you say? That the Americans will only see the water if they come at night but if they come during the day, which is natural, they won't see the little epileptic dribble. Yes, very well! The Mayor is correct. Yes, but nevertheless, I believe... Forget it, you outvoted. The dribble is forgotten! Well, then, you'll have to think of something else. Well, of course, that's not so easy. My friends, I'm going to propose a solution. Get rid of the flies, they're bugging me! In this town there is a man who has been to America, and who knows Boston like the palm of his hand. He has presented several spectacles with great success. Of course, I am referring to the singer's manager. Well, that's certainly an idea. - A good thing. - And she's very agreeable. Very, very agreeable. If you only knew how fine her conversation is. Her best feature is her legs! Yeah, you're right! And her... And I am just talking to you about her talent. Yeah, she has lots of talent! Well, gentlemen, are we going to talk about hanky panky, or the Americans? We could put this man in charge of the welcome for the Americans, paying him a small stipend for his work. He knows their tastes. It'll be better than the little epileptic dribble that you thought of. I do not tolerate ironies about the dribble. A modicum of scientific knowledge, it would help you to understand that the solar rays... - Enough! - Do you want me to talk...? - Yes, sir. Well, the meeting is adjourned. We're adjourned, but against my wishes. I oppose any kind of welcome that you're planning for the Yankees. Understood? Can you tell me what's going on? Why are you stuck in this room, not watching me perform? Stop jabbering, girl, you make me dizzy. It's just that I take these things badly, you know how I am. Well, you shouldn't... Why do you have such a long face, my dear? You look like a sad sack. Look, girl, you wanna shut up? Can't you see the men are talking? - Keep quiet! - I was discussing with my friend here... It turns out that he's in charge of the welcoming for the Americans, and he has thought of something. - Something that rocks! - What is it? What I told you about before, girl. The song? And this idiot didn't like it? This idiot has his doubts. I'm assuring you one thing: if my plan is not a success, you'll not have to pay my fee. And furthermore, my client, the foremost Andalusian songstress, will remain here and perform for the next four months free as a benefit for the poor children, and I, as publicity, will give you a box of cigars. But what are you assuring me? That despite the hurry the Americans are in - and Americans are always in a hurry - they're going to remain in town four days, giving gifts to the people, and leaving all kinds of dollars behind in your Café. What do you think? - And what do you think? - Oh, sure, I believe that. I say so and think that for her, 4 days is too little time. They'll probably stay 4 months. Isn't that right, girl? - Right. Yeah, sure. Perhaps you're right, but it's going to cost a bundle. Naa, they're giving me the stuff on credit at a place I know. - Can we use the bus? - Sure. Well, then, you and I will go to the capital to pick up the stuff... you ready? - Yeah, I am. - See you tomorrow, girl. Till tomorrow, Manolo. Till tomorrow, girl. Everything ready, Jenaro? - Yes, sir. - To the Capital! After you. Half an hour! Are you aware? Half an hour waiting! Yes, sir, I am aware. Half an hour waiting. But do you have any idea where he could be? Well, what do I know, maybe he's in the pasture, or he went to the mill, or maybe he went to the depot. Maybe, maybe. Why don't you go find him immediately! The Americans, we are receiving them with joy! Don Pablo! Don Pablo! Hello, Jeronimo. - They're waiting for you, Mr. Mayor. - Waiting for me? Who? I have no idea. He came in that motorcycle. He's upstairs. The one on the balcony? Yeah, and he's been waiting for about an hour. Oh, well, he can wait a little longer, let's go get a drink... Americans... I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor, but he has the humor of someone at a wake... Let's go, come on! I think the Delegate sent him. You know, I don't give a hoot about the Delegate - I know that, but... - Listen, Manolo... make sure they take care of unloading the things. Your wish is my command, my General! Listen, come here. I'm going to put you under the orders of that man and you're going to play everything he tells you, but without backtalk. - Understand? - Yes, sir, I understand. Come on! - You let me know what. - Everything. - What? You do it and shut up! Good. Don't you want to sit down, sir? Sir, I have been sitting for 45 minutes. It's incredible how time flies! Well, I just returned from a trip, a trip. And here I am at your service. - OK... - What nonsense are you bringing me now? What are you saying, man? I'm bringing you a personal message from His Excellency, the Delegate. Ah, yes, the Delegate. Is he in good health? - Perfectly! - Oh, good! Here is the message. Good. What do you mean, good? The day after tomorrow the Americans will be here. And you're being so blasé about it! - What do you want me to do? - Do me a favor and come here... - Notice... - And what do you want me to notice? What do you see from here? The usual... the church tower, the fountain, the houses, the Café, the bus... and the walls. - The walls! Can't you see? You see the same thing, Sure... the same shit. The fountain the same, the Café the same, the houses the same, and the whole town the same! This is where we live... Are you questioning me? What will they say when they see it? What impression will the Americans take away with them? Are the Americans coming to take something away? Because I thought everything to the contrary. Don't you try to make excuses for yourself. In the other towns of this province, they have made big floral arches, they have whitewashed their houses, and hung banners, and even their poor fountains, they have converted them to magnificent light displays. With the little dribble...? Yes, sir, with the little dribble that... - And what! - No, nothing... Personally, to me, that of a dribble... Silence! His Excellency the Delegate... ...will have news of what's happening in Villar Del Campo. Villar Del Rio! - Good day! - Go with God... Dribble...! Hey, hey, listen, sir...! Give my regards to the honorable Delegate! By the order of the honorable Mayor... I'm letting you know... that everyone here should maintain silence! Dear neighbors of Villar Del Rio! As your Mayor, I owe you an explanation. And this explanation I'm going to give you is that I, as the elected Mayor, owe you an explanation, - Because I... - One moment, one moment... just relax, Mr. Mayor... Hush, hush... I'm not doubting that the Mayor will give you an explanation, but if he's not clear, I'm here to do it. Because you, neighbors, have rights, are involved and deserve the respect, listen to and be be disciplined at his orders, so that you can enjoy with them the heroism without peer of this noble town, that will gain you the most pride in the whole world. - Listen, kid, please... - Yeah? Change hats with the kid next to you because your is too small. That's better. I... because I'm the Mayor, I owe you an explanation... And I'm going to give you an explanation because I owe it... The explanation is not necessary. Because you are intelligent and smart, specially, and this is the fundamental reason, you are noble and brave... - Very well... - And no other town around, could steal the triumph that you deserve, for your courage, pride without peer. - You, good looking... - Who, me? Yeah, you the one with the glasses... Move your flower to another place, we can't see the girl behind you. I'm telling you, because I am your Mayor... ...that the Americans are coming! And the Honorable Delegate has offered a prize to the one who welcomes them best. Ah, but not just best... but also to their taste. I, my friends, who have been in America, I, who knows that noble but infantile mentality, I will show them Spain through they eyes of Andalusia! But, understand me: It is not that I speak as they deserve of these Castilian towns, for their exemplary ways... - Those ways! - It is the fame of our bullfights of our bullfighters, of our gypsies, and above all our Flamenco singing that has erased the fame of all the rest, and seeks from us our Folkloric ways. We will win the prize for our welcome because the other towns have only put up banners, triumphant arches and illuminated fountains. With dribbles! With dribbles! Frivolous frippery! Tomorrow, when the rest of the supplies arrive, and we finish decorating the streets and houses, we will hold a general rehearsal of the Welcoming. And I recommend, my good friends, that you should start thinking about what you're going to the Americans for, because I'm giving you my word of honor that they'll remain a great amount of time here, spending all their money! And in conclusion, I am telling you that this is the time to unite our efforts to give the best Welcome of anyone, to these friends. To these formidable friends! To these... Indians! Indians! Indians! And you're all a bunch of clowns! A bunch of spineless jellyfish, a bunch of nincompoops! You're masquerading to impress strangers to get gifts. And what kind of a Mayor are you? What are you trying to do? Listen, Don Luis, I... Don't 'Don Luis' me! Where has all the money come from to buy...? ...this! And this! From our own pockets? From the pockets of all the constituents? And what do you think you're going to achieve with all this 'piñata'? To be an Indian in front of those Indians! Doesn't anyone here have any pride, dignity? No one? It's shameful! Let me pass! Let me pass! Let me pass! Dear friends, we don't have to pay much mind to good old Don Luis, you know he gets mad about everything. And whom I will convince with a few words, that he is completely wrong! Because to fix the town costs money, but not one penny has come out of the municipal funds. Because the municipal lockbox, as well you know, has never had a penny in it, and has always been empty. Because all these costumes have been advanced on credit by a friend of this great friend of mine, Manolo, here present! To whom we can never be grateful enough, for his efforts on behalf of our town! We shall pay all that we owe when the American dollars come. We are very optimistic. The good days are just around the corner! Let's all knuckle down and get to work! Here comes the moment... - Men... - Women... - Children. To work! Viva Villar Del Rio! Let's raise this section first. And second we'll put up the lamps. Loosen the cape, one, two, three... - This is the third time... - One, two, three. One, two, three, and with grace... The hat, the jacket, the shirt, the pants, the comb, the flower, the ruffles, the stole. Remember that the long one is the one for the minutes. But be careful that the semi-circular rotation of the big hand coincides with the meridian at Greenwich, understand? Just set the hands like you see on this clock. ...and don't forget that this chronometer has a six-second base delay, have you understood that? I'm going to see if the supplies have arrived... Don't let the clock be slow, the Americans must see a clock that's working! And also, to ring the hours, strike this with the hammer. Listen, fill that up with flower pots. Not too low, we don't want them to hit the head. To the right... to the right... a little more... More... - Yeah. - Paco? - Yeah? - Listen, lower the head. A little more to the right... Listen, the Street of the Dew... make it a little narrower. More... more... Curro... connect the lamp. - And make sure they're well secured. - Yes, sir. Hurry up, we've got lots more to do. I know, I know - you can turn it on now. I'm letting you know that Mr. Mayor proclaims that you must be present dressed as Andalusians for the rehearsal of the Welcoming for the Americans! And nobody is excused! We're receiving you, Americans, with happiness... A pair of mules. A pair of oxen. And a truck. - Do you want no more than that, Chulario? - No, sir. Next. What do you ask? I want 20 sacks of fertilizer for the potatoes. A new yoke and a bird clock... - You mean a cage? - No, a clock. It cannot be, you know you can only ask one thing from the Americans. Choose between the yoke and the clock. The bird clock. - The yoke would be best for you. - A car, a car, I want a car... - To pull it? - No, to hook up to the mule. Well, grandpa, decide... don't you need anything? - Nothing. - But surely there's something you need? What? Come on, man, you have a right to ask. A color magazine. But what colors? Speak, speak. With all the junk. What junk? Perhaps better a clarinet. The gentleman needs a clarinet. Take it down. Next! I want... You don't want anything because you've already asked. No, I have not asked before. He's right, he's Ingracia's boy. Ingracia? And what do you need, shoes? Tee-shirt? A racing bike. Noted. Next... Well, really, I want... - With a bell! - Yeah, with a bell. Pardon, what do you want? A pair of dairy cows. Ah, milk cows. Two milk cows. Step up. What do you want? I want... Don't be an ass, that can't be. Then, a she-mule. - It's the same. - Go on. Next! What is it that you want? Come on, hurry up, what is it you want? I want a big mirror, I want an embroidery frame, and a... And nothing! I have already said you can only ask one thing of the Americans. Come on, decide. Maria, what are you asking for? A sewing machine! A sewing machine? Now because I told you last night about the sewing machine, - you go and ask for it! - I have a right to ask for what I want! Order! No fighting! Each one can ask for whatever they want! That's my last word! What do you want? - Eh? - What do you want? What do you need? Eh? Tell them what you like best. Eh? It's impossible. Mama Dolores is very deaf, and it will be a long time before she understands the question. But I'll tell you in secret: Mama Dolores wants chocolates. Well, there you have it. Villar Del Rio. 642 inhabitants are making their wish list. All have a right to ask, whatever their age. Male or female, all have a right to ask for one thing. Only one. And that is so difficult. Frankly, difficult. You can imagine, of all the desires... one. Of all the things that you want or need, only one. Yes, it is very difficult. Frankly, difficult. All of a sudden, one realizes that in reality you want something else. Instead of a yoke, what you really need is a suit to dance in on Sundays. How can you know what you wish? You have worked the land for 30 years, and in the long run what you wish for is a pair of binoculars. All this is very strange. Why does the lazy man, Julio, who spends all his days on his back watching the clouds go by, ask for weights to do exercises? And who could know that Rafael, our official chronometer keeper, besides getting always late, all he wants is a good umbrella. Don Cosme has asked for a new bell. And who knows, maybe he's listening to it now. Well. That's it. Everything is back to normal. The women are going to the rosary. The men are in the Café. Everything as usual. Well... not exactly. Now, the people are more tranquil. They know the wishes of their neighbors. And Don Pablo is going to organize all the petitions. Of all? No. There is a man who hasn't asked for anything. Don Luis, the nobleman, has asked for nothing. At least, not yet, and I don't think he will, even though, looking at it in another way... no, he will not ask for anything. Or perhaps he will, because in the long run, to ask costs so little. Well, this is the time to think about the petitions. Now is when one thinks of the advantages of the polisher, or the plow that you asked for instead of the motorcycle. Or of the teachers' manuals that surely Miss Eloisa... Now there are so many things to dream of that it becomes difficult to sleep. Isn't that right, Rafael? But of course, Rafael is late for everything, even sleep. That's the way it is. Now they're all resting. Now is the time for all the things that they have, at some point, secretly dreamed of to soon appear. Don Cosme, for example: What celestial music is he hearing? ...49 million Protestants, 5 million Jews... It's nothing, Don Cosme, it's nothing. A bad dream... an absurd nightmare. Those infidels that you want to evangelize are only ferocious in dreams. Calm yourself, it has passed. Probably your dinner didn't sit right with you. Well, that's it. Get some rest, Don Cosme. Darn! Don Luis is still awake. Hmm... he won't be for long. He's almost there... See? Yoo-hooo. Yeah, it's just a dream, don't give it any importance. And besides, it's fairly late. Why don't you go to bed? Good night. Good night, Don Luis. Wouldn't you like to know what scenario our Mayor is contemplating? I would. I'm curious. There's no need to worry, Don Pablo, in the dream tomorrow you will kill the bandit and marry the girl. All the movies and all the dreams end like that. Now, put you pistol in your holster and sleep. Why don't you try dreaming about your daughters? Poor Juan. Things are not going well for him. He has a large family. He works from sunup to sundown for almost nothing, and on top of that, at night... Kids! Shut up! Sweet dreams, Juan. Sweet dreams. Have a good time, Juan. Have you seen their strange dreams? It is that tonight is not an ordinary night in Villar Del Rio. This evening is the eve of the most important day of their history. Tomorrow the Americans arrive. "Welcome, boys!" Here they are! They're coming over the hill! They're here! Get ready! Music! Welcome to Villar Del Rio, welcome to Villar Del Rio... It is very possible that this tale has no end. In general, things never finish altogether, or they rarely happen as one imagines them. But don't think that the town is sad because the Americans passed through without stopping. No. There you have them. Happy? Yes, they're happy. You cannot imagine how opportune is this rain. With this rain, many things will grow. Hope, for example. While of course they have to shoulder between all of them without blaming anyone, the expenses of this carnival. Those who cannot contribute with money pay with goods. It's the same. Those who, a few days ago, asked for tractors, can hardly give a sack of potatoes today. In reality, the petitions are reversed. And no one is holding a grudge. Especially, no one is sad. Well, Manolo and Carmen Vargas are a little sad... They had grown attached to Villar Del Rio. And Villar Del Rio to them. That's why Manolo feels a little guilty about what happened, and pays his debt with that gold ring that they gave him in Boston. Now, they have given their bread and salt. And everything is equally useful, the invention of recreational physics with which the doctor tried to demonstrate the ballistic trajectory of the pigeons, or the apparatus with which Don Pablo fought his deafness, or the old sword that, in America, one of Don Luis' ancestors fought with, before being eaten by the Indians. Thank you very much, Don Luis. It's all equal. All that is given today has, for these good people, the same value. That of their hearts. Well, all that is left now is to disassemble all the props. The artificial flowers, the phony costumes, the false fronts, and the false cardboard hats of the fake Andalusians. In short, those speedy Americans have crossed and that's it all... ...no influence, no memories. Enough. Everything is becoming orderly. No one remember anything any more. Now the word of the day is not to worry. Genaro's bus is taking away Manolo and Carmen Vargas, the greatest star of the Andalusian genre, and Villar Del Rio returns to what it has always been: an ordinary little town. As you know, sometimes things happen, but... but later, the sun come out and everything shines, and everything repeats itself. The smoke rises quietly again, the women sew in silence. The cows are not chewing Chiclets; they just do it out of habit. Yes. Now there is sunshine and hope. The bell rings. The old bell. Listen. The man who is working straightens up and rests. Or dreams, looking up. Towards the heavens. Because, definitely, who doesn't believe in the 3 wise men? And, "colorin Colorado, este cuento Se ha acabado". THE END
