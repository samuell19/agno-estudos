Who cares if I am or not Come on,Betty let's be happy and catch a nice crab and cook a lovely dinner for your dad All right,but I must go and get the basket out of that shed,won't be a sec What's the matter,what is it? He is in there -Who? -The man last night Stay here I heard something moving I thought it was animal at first Never mind about that,where is he now? I locked him in You'd better give me the key My dear,why do you look so worried he is safe there He can't get out until the police comes again Have you been to the police? Not yet But if you like and can go and tell them now For what it is worth If anyone gets to the police I will And there are too many people poking their noses into my business Why do you speak to me like that? Are you frightened of the police? Is that it? I think I'll change my clothes and go back to the fair Here is your key Wait a minute,Marie I'm sorry I spoke like that Shall I make a cup of tea,Dad? No You'd better go and get something for dinner as you didn't get me crabs Yes,dad And don't you worry,Betty I'm gonna fix everything straight away Camelia Marie,can I come in for a minute? As you wish I'm sorry I flared up like that just now I said I was sorry I'm used to being treated like dirt by the Gowshall and by everybody I didn't think you would start the same Anyway there's no time for arguing I shall be late for the performance Hear What will you say if you never was allowed to go to the fair again I would say thank heavens Well I'll fix everything I've seen Gowshall and I paid off your debts You are free Is it true? -You are not pulling my leg? -No,I'm not pulling your leg Are you pleased? Pleased? I don't know whether I am on my head or my feet How can I thank you? Here You mustn't do that to me Was Gowshall serious? He did cut up a bit rough when I told him Told him what? That We You and I were going to be married That was what you said I was looking (?) But I hadn't asked you then But you said you wanted a little home of your own And I'm offering it to you now Why don't you say something? You know how I'm longing to see my mother I thought I could go back to her You can go For a visit After we are married If not this year,we'll certainly next spring or so You see owing to all expenses I have had lately My savings are running a bit low just now Was it out of your savings that you bought the frock(?) for Betty and paid Gowshall? Oh,yes What did you think? I don't know I thought you had a little What do you call it? A little windfall The suitcase How did you know about that? Never mind how I know there is something bad with this suitcase Oh,yeah,I warned you before,Marie, not to poke your nose into my business You can't forbid my mouth to talk Is that how you are going to treat me? Once we are married I think you have done something wrong And I don't want to be mixed with it I've been a bit foolish,that's all, private and simple things,right? You'll have to take my word for it You don't even trust me enough to tell me what happened and I shall marry you? And now you can say nothing,ha All right I'll trust you I'll show how much I trust you So I dashed out of the signal box and I dived in after him That's what I found in the suitcase I got no secret from you Are you satisfied? How much is it? 5000 quid 5000? Is it real money? Yes,that's real money What are you going to do? I know I ought to have informed the police as soon as I found the money For once I didn't do the right thing But don't think too badly of me,Marie And I give you my solemn oath before we are married I'll have everything settled and wiped there If you give it back they will put you in prison But even if the do it would only be for a fortnight or so That would be a nice beginning for my married life Waiting for a criminal to come out of prison But at least it will be over and done with And I could never be happy with this on my conscience What about me? You show me this money You let me have a beautiful dream take me to France Take you to France? With this money in France we can have a wonderful life All safe all tranquille But you want to lose your job, you want to go to prison You want the poor little Betty so miserable You're cruel Don't take on like this ,Marie We'll think of some way around it,see I implore you in France one can live We can buy a nice house With a wonderful fishing boat for you in(?) And for me the kitchen and the ménage And we find Betty a good husband and get her a nice handsome dowry Everybody would envy and respect us But what good what that do if we couldn't respect ourselves But if we make fool of ourselves then we can respect us What happens with this money if you give it back? To what people is it? Some bank perhaps, some rich old businessman who doesn't need it Are they better than Betty,or I or my starving mother? This people you don't know at all Listen,Marie Don't go near me Listen,say I did agree How are we going to get to France? You leave that to me First We hide the money again I think I take a note to the Gowshall Wait a minute Put that back I'll give you five pounds out of my savings -Once we start touch that -Dear what are you talking about? You agreed that we keep the money,didn't you? Not definitely Oh yes you did You want me to be happy,don't you? Yes Do what I tell you and everything will be all right Marie Can you get through to the police up there? What is it? Somebody drowned himself? Looks like someone done him in,his head bashed in All right,I relay the information Hello Thatcher speaking,Sir They just fished a corpse up near the window here But he will starve to death in that shed But why do you worry about? This man is a criminal Yes, but he is a human being like we are He didn't really mean to do that (?) He was just trying to defend himself that's all You must have that right out of your head Right out of your head,see He wouldn't take any risk to save you And you listen to me This is what we do We take one of those day trips across the channel And once we are there,we disappear Be quiet for a bit You agree to this Whatever happens? Yes,Marie Sorry to disturb you,Mr Mallison but the chief want a word with you Oh,what about? I guess it's about this corpse they fished out Near your signal box Corpse? I'll be down straight away Right There you are,the sooner we get away with the money the better What you mean I oughtn't go to the police? Bert,of course you go,anything you have to watch is your tongue In the meantime I prepare everything and in the morning we start Trust me,that's all All right All right,Marie You recognize him? I've never seen him,Sir Does that face mean anything to you? No,Sir -Are you quite certain about that? -Yes,Sir On the night of the 18th, during the course of your night shift are you quite certain you didn't hear any noises indicative of a fight or quarrel?? Well,you see,Sir,there is always a bit of a din going on outside the box Faint shouting,engine whistles and that Yes I remember now there was a heavy wind blowing that night so for that been anything that unusual well I wouldn't have any chance to hear it,would I Sir? That sounds reasonable enough I would like to see the signal box for myself,would you have any objections? Oh,no,Bates ring up the stationmaster tell him Inspector Dupré will be coming along Excellent,Inspector You say Monsieur Dupré has my full permission to examine the harbour station signal box Yes Sir Send then next one in -You want me any more,Sir -That'll be all for the moment -All right,Sir -Thank you Thanks for taking over Bert,you're a real pal,mate OK Cheerio I wonder we introduce them you see,Mademoiselle Camelia My wife,Marie This is Marie Mallison How lucky he is this rich Englishman to have such a beautiful wife What lovely clothes he gets her And his daughter Betty,what a lucky girl, Funny,old Bert running off like that How does saw that old Bert turned out to be thief Is it right dad? With there in the shed? You starve He'll starve You have a nice easy job here No wonder you're not interested in the world outside When you're so warm and snug You gave me a quite a start? Don't disturb yourself I only want to look around Carry on,Sir You must be very keen on your job I understood that you didn't start your shift for sometime yet You see my mate was taken sick and he asked me to take over for him You are a kind-hearted man He'd done same for me if I felt seedy I'm surprised to find that you can see so little from your vantage point up here In fact you can see nothing at all surely in the course of your job it is necessary to see trains come and go How do you manage? I rub the glass clear like you did,Sir Yes,but of course How stupid of me It's hot in here You don't mind if I let in a little air -Do you like a cig? -No thank you Have you found the man who have done it yet? -The murderer? -Yes That is for the English police my job is to get the money back -What sort of money is stolen -5000 £ You know it's a bit chilly in here We don't usually have these windows open until the warm weather I'm surprised,you are not more curious, you can see so much from here There you see,they have no idea they are observed I should find it most delightful to sit in that seat It's no interest to me spying on cork and cotton My friend,law is not your living, you might observe from these windows There are all the fashion so fickle(?) If not greater interest, anger,cupidity if you had been less content with your warm stove for the night If you had been less frightened by the draft You might even had had the thrill of witnessing a murder That bloke,he couldn't have been done in under that window then I'd heard something But you told the CID Inspector that there was too much noise here the wind, and the trains shunting You get a few minutes advance when it's quiet And it would just depend whether the fight took place during one of those quiet spells,wouldn't it? Perhaps you are looking not to have witness the murder After all Paul Brown might have looked up and come in here and done for you too But knowing the sort of fellow he is I take it more likely he would bribe you to keep your mouth shut With some of the 5000£ Hear,if you are insinuating I'm insinuating nothing Perhaps I nearly letting my French imagination run away with me I have nothing against you my friend I know nothing about you But I cannot exclude no possibilities and what I suggest is a possibility That's all Go on with your nap,please An if any recollection of some incident should come back to you you know,some things that might have slipped your memory You might let me know I am at the Thetford Hotel Don't forget,will you? Monsieur Dupré,Thetford Hotel Mallison,here,Sir I have to go out,my little girl has been taken ill Sorry can you hang on for another hour? No,I ought to go now,Sir, she's pretty bad -All right set by the rules and run away -Thank you very much,Sir Mr Brown Are you there? Mr Brown Mr Brown Listen I know you are here I won't give you away Are you right then? Feel that way about it? I've come in to help you You know what you need is some grub I brought you some Some sandwiches in there Well,you can see them if you don't believe me Or hear There is no use you shamming dead But if you done about they find a lot smashed There's the grub And I brought you a few little rum I'll go now I'll bring you some more grub in the morning Answer me can't you I can't stand here all night Look here I'll give you until I count three Do you hear me? Then I count three One Two I'm sorry I didn't mean it You know I didn't mean you any harm I'll get you a doctor I'll give you back your money Or help you to get away I didn't start it you know I didn't I was just getting you some grub wasn't I ? I knew it might be(?) I might have Dad we didn't expect you yet There is some soup for you in the kitchen Dad Not honey You must leave me alone Sorry Marie I want that What's wrong with you? Where have you been? Give me back that note you took this morning Come on,give it to me What's that on your hand? It's on your coat too What have you done? It's all over Our trip to France All over I've killed him You've killed him? Or you're mad You're crazy You've ruined everything What are you coming about for? We must get away from here at once I must give this money back You can leave it behind they can find it quick enough Here ,here is the money I took Now we haven't touched any of them Sorry Marie but I must see these thing through on my end But you can't you killed a man They'll hang you,don't you understand,they'll hang you Are you sorry that he came at me first? I hit back I had to So it was in self defence you killed him I'll tell you what to do You tell them you went to the shed to prepare for a fishing expedition You didn't know this man was in the shed You've never seen him before He attacked you and you defended your self When he was dead you found he had hidden the suitcase in the boat And you took it direct to the police It is all so easy I don't want the easy way out I'm going to tell them the truth But why? Why would you with a rope around your neck I must have the old things settled for good and all I must You must You want You always only think of you What about me? What shall I do? What shall become of me? -Listen Marie -Don't touch me Don't dear touch me with those hands So I don't want to have anything to do with the blood on your hands I could have been so happy but you had to go and destroy it all Oh what a fool you are I hate you Don you hear me?
