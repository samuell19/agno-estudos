"What I'm sad about, What I'm sad about." I'll open the guitar. A girl without an address everywhere looking. And in the afternoon, and at night sometimes. Perhaps, it is far, far away. Perhaps, she is very close. Find a man in Moscow is not easy, When the registration is unknown... One, two, three, four, five. Grandma, what do you think of me? I'm not a suitcase. Pure punishment, Lord! Comrade boss, where does the 10th car stop? "That's the end of the platform, okay?" I see. "So there is not one there." Do you want to bitch your bitch? - I see. Tse is also not there. Here is the booth of the 10th wagon. Hurry up, granny, bo train costs 1 minute. Father, how can I succeed there? It's so high up there. How will I climb there when I have so many things?! Grandma, I'll help you! Thank you, honey. And what are you worth? "Pure punishment!" You can not build a platform, so at least help. - Tse is not our concern. - How is it not your concern?! Take it! So, let's go! Why do you have such a short platform? This is not true! Tse does not depend on us. - And from whom? - From the management of the road. We are this the question has already been raised more than once. - Grandma, I want to! - Well, that's another thought. Pure punishment! Sit down, grandmother! So, fuck. Thank you very much. Only you do not put questions, but platforms. So, 66 to 23 in your favor. Grandma, if you need anything, I will help you. - Hello. - Hello. - Where is the 14th place? - Here, please. Now the girl with us will play in the flip-flop. Yes? - I do not play. - Do you play the balalaika? No, I'm not. Then on the guitar, for the first time. And we do not know each other. - Anyway, we'll get acquainted. - Hardly. All! Our quiet male life ended. May be enough? I agree. Break. 66 times lost. They say that anyone is not lucky in cards, he is lucky in love. Not always. "Raise your legs." In vain you. The conductor will come and take everything away. - You are not ashamed before the conductor? - It's a shame. "Is that what you need?" Empty are not needed. - With a pepper a damsel. - An ulcer. A young man, this is a non-smoking car. This is a car for smokers. But if you do not like it, we can go out. Tell me, do you always put things in order or only on transport? Do you violate them only on transport or everywhere? - Everywhere. - It can be seen! Let's go have a smoke. Document. "Help: Dana Ekaterina Ivanovna Ivanova in the fact that she worked in the artel "Voskhod" and dismissed at will in connection with the incompatibility of character. Prev The Klyachkin Board." Here is a ticket, money. So this is our neighbor. - Well, what about you? - Exactly. It is immediately evident, that an unruly character. Allow. Citizen, this have you now sat down? Your ticket. Give it back. I just do not know where he went. Do I have to pay a fine? The rule reads: "The loss of the ticket is answered by the one who lost it." "You violate the rules, too." Listen, leave me at rest! A fine is big? Do not worry, do not have you fine to pay. Here are your documents. And why did you take someone else's ticket?! Do not Cry! I did not take them from you, but found them in the corridor, on the floor. Instead of "thank you" say, shout. Many thanks. "And your heart, I guess,". - In the heels gone. Yes? - Still would! "Where are you going?" To Moscow? To Moscow. Come on, smoke! Come on, I will not. And why did they fire you? Yes, so, in connection with the incompatibility of character. Klyachkin? Yeah. "And who is he?" Rogue. "What a crook?" "He is the chairman of the artel." I criticized him, but he fired me. - And go to Moscow to your father? - No. "Mother?" - No. "To your husband?" No, to my grandfather. I have no one but him. And then they fired. - And does your grandfather work for you? - Yeah. Does not want to retire leave. He works in the district council. So the authorities? - Yes. - What is he managing from you? The doors. "How are the doors?" And so. He's a watchman. And in Moscow, what are you going to do? Work? Aha. And learn. I have high hopes for Moscow. "They're going to become an actress." "How did you guess?" Now all the girls dream of being actresses. It would be good to become an actress. Here to us the operetta came, so I revised all the productions. - Do you sing? - A little bit. "Sing something." - What do you mean? Everyone is already asleep. "And you are quiet." Now. No no. - Quietly. - Okay. And about what you sing? About love. About love? I here recently heard a song, it's not really about love, but all the same. From a small age we lived side by side, One track walked. From a small age we were friends, From a young age we were friends, And they studied and grew up. And now he is afraid of me as a meeting with fire. He walks by every evening, Hardly looks at me. Explain, if you can, Why did he become like that? I am sad and anxious, I am sad and anxious. I have lost peace. He looks at me sternly, And I do not understand, What is this touchy thing, What is this touchy thing. Has he dear to my heart? And recently flew Before me on the side, That he, too, every now and then Turns about me. My heart is troubled, I do not know what to do. It is absolutely impossible, absolutely impossible. Without him live. - And that's all. - You sing well. - True? Did you like it? - True. - Do you work or study? - I'm at home building. Let's get acquainted for real. Paul is calling me. Simply - Pasha. - Kate. - Katya Ivanova with an uneasy character, I know everything. Sing something else. What are you, it's time to sleep. Good night, Pasha. Good night, Katya. To the third platform comes the train 43 "Sochi-Moscow". "Katya, can I see you off?" What are you, I'll get there myself. - Good luck. - Happily. - Bye. - And you can get lost in Moscow. - And I will not get lost. - But to me in the same direction. - In which? - There, where to you. In which? You do not know my address. So I recognize him. Kate! Wait for me. Good? I am waiting. What have you done?! All my diet was scattered. "Citizen, allow me to pass." "Wait, young man, we still have not finished harvesting fruit. "Katya, wait, now I am." Are you crazy? Katia, you go, I'll go on the other side. "Oh, Catherine!" Oh, grandfather! - Aligned something like! Bride. - Hello. The second day to this train I leave, as the letter received. Is it all your dowry? All. Let's go. "Wait, Grandfather!" The people will wither, and let's go, and then jostle. Come on, we ourselves all shove. Grandfather, wait. My shoe was unbuttoned. - Well, I found a place. All? On. - I still have the right one. "Are not you waiting for someone to accompany you?" - What do you mean, grandfather. Come on. There Paul! "That's great, Pavel!" Get out! Wait a minute, here a friend is waiting for me. "What comrade?" - Wait. - Pasha! Pasha! - Wait, now. Pasha! Where are you going? - Kate! - Pasha! Kate! Address! "Tell me the address!" Nicolo... Pasha! Has a comrade left? Good-bye, good companion. Listen, what streets in Moscow begin with Nikolo? - Nicholas the Fool. - Nikolo-Zapyantsovsky. - Nikolo-Svyatovsky. - I ask you seriously! FUNNY MUSIC Well, here we are. The place of my work is the district Soviet power. And in this house I live. Let's go to. There. In the 41st apartment. Grandpa, it's not my fault. I just could not stand it. But I was fired of my own free will. Take the jam. I must tell you as a person with experience, as a native from the last century, that people do not need to rush in vain. And sometimes it's useful to keep your temper. Grandfather, and I'm nothing to people I do not rush. I just do not like when they do wrong. How do you know, right or wrong? "It's clear, Grandfather!" How? That's right - it's Soviet, but wrong - it's not Soviet. Every child will understand this, but I have already finished 7 classes! This is true. But you, Katerina, by the youth of years and you can make a mistake. It's good that your grandfather is alive, a person with a position. And do not be me - you will be lost. This is for you, Grandpa. Thank you. As for your employment. With Semyon Petrovich we must talk. Our housekeeper. We will think about where to take a step, it is also necessary to choose. If the streets of Moscow pull into one, Then on it you will pass through the whole country. If you put all the stairs in Moscow into one, Then on it you will climb up directly to the Moon. Here it is - The big, big, Friendly with everyone, In all hearts is alive. Favorite native Beauty-Moscow. It is possible to get lost in it exactly in five minutes. But she is full of friends - And they will find you. Caress, cheer, say: "Do not be shy." The red stars burn at night over it. Here it is - The big, big, Friendly with everyone, In all hearts is alive. Favorite native Beauty-Moscow. Day and night, like surf, everything is boiling around. But someday I will meet with you, my friend. I sing alone now, and then together. This song of mine we'll sing with you. Here it is - The big, big, Friendly with everyone, In all hearts is alive. Favorite native Beauty-Moscow. - Nothing happens. - Oh, grandfather. Did you play in plays? In amateur artistry? - Yeah. - So how is it? There is a voice, no? I don't know. I was once awarded an honorary diploma. I have an acquaintance on this part, a man of art. He works at the Operetta Theater. Operettas? Yes. Cloakroom attendant. A great connoisseur. I'll ask him to check that you have - talent or just so, an honorary letter. - And what did they tell you in the reference? - I was completely confused. - What? - One Moscow has 2 Nikolo-street, 10 Nikolo-lanes and 2 Nikolo-dead end. - So. - If the streets do not take into account, turns 12 lanes. In each lane there are 20 houses. I multiplied 12 for 20 and received 240 houses. This. And what is it? And this - in each house for 20 apartments. 20 multiply on 240-it turns out 4800 apartments. Will you have to get around this? - What is there to do? - How long does it take? If I go through 30 apartments a day... - Of course, 100 can not be bypassed. - That turns out 160 days. This is six months. "Not counting the streets." And if with the streets, then in general astronomy. You know, Pasha, take a vacation for a month, and then a month 2 you will have a ballot. And why the bulletin? Probably, you'll work harder without days off, you'll get tired. Pasha, do you remember on which bus she left the station? What are you! In this turmoil, I did not understand. Either 4, or 14. Listen, Pash, tomorrow we will find out, in the area of which Nicholas pass the 4th and 14th. And first, we'll scratch these areas. Correctly. Klavochka! Claub, are you asleep? Let's get the panel here. Pasha, I'll read you a poem by Stepan Shchipachev. What, what? "Love I carried through all the separation And happy that away from you." Klava, I need a panel, not Stepan Shchipachev. Do you hear? Well, what's wrong with you? Pavlushka, this is my heart beating. Do you hear? I can not hear. Come on the panel, Klava. Timothy Timofeevich, now we will perform the Countess's aria from the operetta "The Boy-Hussar". Katerina. I'm in real life, Arnold, I've seen a lot. I loved a lot, I suffered a lot. You're a boy, Arnold, And you do not understand, What does it mean, what does it mean to Love and suffer. Countess. Child, forget about the unfortunate decanter. I will not meet with you from now on. Tired heart long without fire. All in the past, Arnold, I have. I pray, stay. Arnold, you follow my advice: Drive the carriage as soon as possible. Parting, Arnold, it's time. Love. Love-ov - Rokova-ah-th game! Come out. What do you think, Timofey Timofeevich? It's good. "But it will not do." - I.e? - She does not have a cascade. - That is talent? No, talent is talent. A cascade - it's a talent with a cascade. - And without a cascade it is impossible? - It is possible, but only in the Moscow Art Theater or in the Small. And we have such artists only for statistics. - Do not understand. - Extras. - In the view do not apply? - They represent the noise behind the scenes or the countess is speechless. But if the talent with the cascade, then this is another matter. And Katerinato? The actress must be a figure-skater, to throw herself into the eyes of the whole entourage. Can I try to put it in the Moscow Art Theater? There I have a friend from our artel. After all, we sing, dance and the audience cheer. One word is an operetta. I know one lovely place. I know one thing... Katerina! He does not take you into an actress. He says you do not fit him. Do not blow your lips, actress! Do not be afraid, I'll make it no worse. Liftstershey will. There's no need for a cascade! "I will not be the elevator man." - I would have known, I would not have called you, An old coat rack. "Well, you know!" After such words, please do not count on the countermark! Ugh! Ugh! "What I'm sad about, What I'm sad about." I'll open the guitar. A girl without an address everywhere looking. And in the afternoon, and at night sometimes. Perhaps, it is far, far away. Perhaps, she is very close. Find a man in Moscow is not easy, When the registration is unknown. Ah, the address table, you are a learned people, Find her by the signs. His eyes are like stars, and his eyebrows fly, And a nose snub nose at the same time. "In Moscow," answers the learned people, "..." Your requests are meaningless. 100 thousand little girls Whose eyebrows roars, And half a million snub-nosed... From the shift I will go back to search again, Only the evening falls over the city. I hope only, friends, for love, She will tell me the way... Let's sum it up. In the 41st apartment there was no one, in the 42nd did not talk at all. The neck was given. - In the 43rd... - At 43.44,45 your Juliet did not have. No, Pasha, let's look for it - we'll stretch our legs. I'm not forcing you, you can not walk. Do not be angry. Remember what else she said. To one landmark the real one was, besides this, Nikola. About the grandfather, she said. - Well? - She has a grandfather. Can you imagine how old grandfathers are in Moscow? Start your grandfathers multiply-divide-such arithmetic will turn out. Yes, she was talking about the operetta. She loves operettas. - Do you like operetta? - I love. - Excuse me, do you like operetta? - I do not know. Love, thank you. Everyone loves me, too. You know, her grandfather is working... "What did your grandfather give you?" - He works in paradise... - Easy. Glavspirt? - No. Paradise... - Good-hearted. - No. - Rayosoves. In the district council as a watchman. "Why did not you say anything before?" It is most important. Comrade Sergeant, how many districts are in Moscow? - 25. - 25 districts - 25 district councils - 25 watchmen. Consider that we found it! Let's go to. Come on. - Pasha! - A! "Where did you go?" To the district council. - The working time is over. - Yes? You know, let's go in the 41st apartment... Pasha, do you see the janitor? - So what? - He looks, there are two healthy the guy in the apartment, damn it, he'll think. Let's go home now, and tomorrow morning in the district councils. Well, let's go. He has all the salt in the button. He pressed and went. It's a simple matter. "I understand, Semyon Semyonitch. "The bosses do not have to interrupt." Come on in." Look here. I need to be on the 5th floor. What am I doing? I press the 5th button and the food. Zaelo. Caught with the 5th? Act on the instructions I approved. That's hanging in a frame. Take the 7th floor, then the "stop". Then back the 5th. We are standing. So? We're not going. In this case, everything is provided. Press the emergency button! CALL Closure. And for this case everything is provided. Listen, we must run after the fitter. "Can not you fix it for good?" Can. Yes, hands all the way do not reach, but I have only two. Clear? I'm now sidetracked in the direction of cultural work. Organized a corner quiet games. Chess, checkers. And then from the children's football... - Everything is fine. The elevator is working. - Thank you. Where, where did you go? My spring... Hey! Ugliness! Take me out of here! Now! Do not worry, please. 7th click, 2nd and 5th. Nothing happens. I shake, does not go. Then it's like this: 1st, emergency, then 5th. CALL. The bell is working, but there is no lift. Read, there are fresh newspapers lying, and I'll run for the fitter. - I'm late for the concert! - Are you an artist? Well yes. "Then I'll do anything for you!" Semyon Petrovich, I can not do this anymore! What a scream?! Do you understand where I broke into? "We have a man there!" Artist! I'm considering the combination here. The actor is in the cage, and you are combining! People are ashamed! In fact, Semyon Petrovich! The elevator has been in trouble for a long time! Do not overdo it, comrades tenants. Elevator gets stuck sometimes, but for a short time. How many today is sitting? - 20 minutes! - Only 20 minutes. Norm. You, Comrade Ivanova, reason on your pawn scale, do not build yourself a queen. And I of it... - Queen. - Of itself, I do not build! I'm soul for the cause sick! Quiet. This is a quiet room games, not discussions. Clear? I make a move with a knight on C-6. "I, too, will make a move with a horse." What? Why did you go to complain about him? I asked him to fix the car in good order, almost cried. Nearly did not cry. A person is by your mercy trouble. And it responds to me. And this is you wrong, Grandfather, speak. As you can on your own grandfather. Criticism to guide?! And if you're talking wrong. We have a big and wonderful house. And because of such a queen people here and suffer, get stuck between the floors. And what kind of people! People are suffering! And I - not people? Walked, old fool, into the legs bowed! He asked! You got a Moscow residence permit! And you? Thanked! Where else can you find such a job? She does not lie on the street! And you do not look for me a job, I'll find it myself. Herself! Where? Actresses from you. It did not work out, the elevator did not work. There's no use to you. If you sit on your neck, just keep quiet. The last district council, the last guard. If not here! "Dear grandfather, you are angry with evil. Will be good. Thank you very much for everything. Your granddaughter Katya." - Hello. - Hello. It's too late. You are on what business in the district council, young people? "Are you Ivanov?" Well, Ivanov. - And you have a granddaughter... - You have a granddaughter Katya Ivanova. And who might you be? What do you know about it? He was traveling with her on a train to Moscow. "In one compartment." So it's because of you at her train station all the time shoes unbuttoned? There is no granddaughter. How not? - She's gone. - Where? In an unknown direction. Seven-year-end, and your grandfather write such communiqués. What do they teach you? She's gone. Grandfather, you must have offended her? And what did I tell her? I did not say anything special to her. - Is it possible to?! You are her grandfather! - So I'm her grandfather, not a fellow traveler! I have every right to teach. And she left. Will be lost now. What a character! Yes, and fellow travelers are different. Can hurt. And what a move! Moscow! Oh! You can not scare people like that! I almost died! And why only this right give! "And you must sue her!" - What does the court have to do with it? Comrade chief, this is not an accident, but a happy meeting. I met a friend. That is the niece of a friend. And slightly braked. Right, darling? Right? "Can I go, Comrade Chief?" You are welcome. Let's go, darling. Thank you. What a disgrace! So they will press in broad daylight! WRIST - Road! "How do you feel, dear?" Nothing. My elbow is broken, and I was scared when you drove over me. "Where should I take you?" I don't know. - You, probably, recently in Moscow? - Recently. It can be seen. You absolutely do not know how to cross the street. You are working? Yes... No, I'm not working now. - Have a living space? - No. Yes, but now I do not. Are you really all right, darling? All. And what? I'll help you. The very fate threw you under my wheels. "What did your grandfather say?" "He does not know himself." He received a postcard from her. So what? She is alive and well. The return address is not. "It's useless to look for her." By the way, there is. - Another option. - What? In the information office I was told that 2137 reside in Moscow. - Yekaterinburg Ivanovs. - So what? You need to know the addresses and get around them all. - Why laughing? - Oh nothing. LAUGHS Until your old age you will look. Beard in, in the hands of a stick: "Grandfather, who do you want?" "To me, Katya Ivanov." "Grandma, your grandfather asks." You are funny, but it seems to me that I will find her anyway. The soul for no one has suffered until now, But you met me. Where have you gone? Where have you gone? Had she dreamed of it? Where have you gone? Where have you gone? Had she dreamed of it? For me it may not be noticeable at all, But I'm such a person, What if I am friends, then I am wholeheartedly friends, And if I love, then for ever. You know, it seems to me that she lives on Taganka. - Why? - On the postcard there is a stamp. Taganskogo post office. She can live in Malakhovka, and threw a postcard on Taganka. Normal people where they live, there and throw. So that's normal. Let them inadvertently disappeared somewhere, Have, dear, in mind, That I'll follow you to the end of the world. And it is necessary - and I'll go further. That I will follow you to the end of the world, And it is necessary - and I'll go further. Tomorrow we'll go to Taganka, right? Let's go to. Katya, you can clean the table. Masik! Will you be ill or go to work? - I, Kusenka, will be a little bit sick. - Correctly, be better, Masik, all the same will not appreciate. Kusenka, are you leaving? Yes. I have 11 mental exercises, and then a massage lower limbs and homeopath. Kate! Leave the vase. This is Bohemian Stove! It can not be touched, you can only pray to him. It becomes unbearable. - Masik. - A cousin. What does Masik want Kusenka to bring him? Masik wants vodka. Vodka? Calm down, Masik. I'll bring it, my handsome. I'll bring it, my angel. Leave the books! The dust is the same, Raisa Palna. This is not the dust with which to fight, it is motionless. Masik, look after this one. And what? She's nothing. - Generally... diligent. - Masik! "Again?" - A cousin. What is "Kusik"? Well, "Cuckoo"? What is a housekeeper? A housekeeper is an internal enemy. I know. Enough! Adore. Not so, Katya! And how, Raisa Palna? We must love our work. Labor ennobles a person. What is a housekeeper? The housekeeper is the director household. You occupy a responsible post. In general, like this. Bad at you it turns out, Katya. I'll be back soon. Do not do anything without me. Just go for cigarettes for Vasil Nikodimych, wash the curtains, wash the floor in the kitchen, buy everything for lunch, shake up the rugs, brush the knives and forks. And when I get back, you'll cook dinner under my direction. - Good morning. - Good morning? Maybe. What, brother, do you get? The bird of God did not know. No care, no labor. She got into the housekeeper. La la la... "Stop it, Vasil Nikodimych!" "What will I do if I fall behind?" - Let go now! - And what will I do if I start up? Let go! A rag, it's unhygienic. Hello. Yes, Komarinsky. What's the matter? What? From the State Control? I'm on my way. Tell Raisa Palne that I was immediately summoned to the office. Vakhter Ivanov listens. Hello. I, the little girl, lived, worried, did not know, Like a swallow, I was free. I met you on your misfortune. To forget, no matter how hard I tried, I could not. To forget, no matter how hard I tried, I could not. You took my fate in maiden destiny. I have not sung songs for a long time. Are we not going to see you again? You left and you did not come back. Lonely forever I will remain. The best years pass irrevocably, And my youth passes with them. I, the little girl, lived, I did not know the worries. Like a swallow, I was free. I saw you and lost you, I lost it the same time I found it. Oh! A! The picture is clear! The crane forgot to close! Oh, and now you will fly. - Disgrace! - Let me go! Oh my God! A nightmare! What happened here? A small flood on two floors! At your expense! Do you understand what you have done? Why did you get into the bath? I did not do anything. I clean, and suddenly water. Who, in your opinion, opened the tap? "It's probably Vasil Nikodimych," before going to work. What right do you have? Blame the responsible employee?! You're lying! ABOUT! What an expensive thing! I am not lying! Oh my God! My Persian carpet! We're broke! You're lying! You will answer for everything! - Raisa Palna, I did not open the tap! - And I'll check it. And woe to you, if you lied! "Check it out!" Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Masik, you bast beet! You forgot to close the tap in the bathroom! - How could I?! - We now have a flood! Kusya, I... "The water is knee-deep." You forgot to close crane! Do you understand what you have done?! We are completely ruined. Give it at will, and let it go on all four sides. The liar! "I'm not a liar." I told you the truth. What are you standing there for?! Carpet save! You must be at my feet to beg, to ask forgiveness. If I had not run into you then, you would have died long ago, like a Swede near Poltava. "A Swede, not a Swede." "How dare you correct me!" "And if you say wrong." Sassy Girl! You do not shout at me! I'm grateful to you for hitting me! But that rush I worked for you. And now I'm leaving you! Let it go all your bohemian stack someone else is serving! And I've had enough! Perfectly! Collect things and get out! By a double-edged desire! - Where are we going now? - Novospassky impasse. Like this. Novospassky, Nicholas the Spassky. So we'll drive... - Sit down please. - Thank you. Citizens, take the tickets. "Be kind, one to the end." Sorry, I forgot the money. I'll be off right now. "Please, I already took it." What you do not need. I'll go anyway. I have already paid. Good. Give your address, I will send you the money. What for? We will come together, and you will repay me. You are welcome. - Where are you going? - I can not such money to throw in the wind. "Embankment". The next one is Novospassky. Seriously, for a long time? "I'm afraid, forever." Well hello. Could you tell me, does Ekaterina Ivanova live in this apartment? In this. "Can you see her?" Why not. You pass. She's in the kitchen now. You walk along the corridor, but it's dark, our bulb is burned out. Then you turn left. Then straight, then again left. "You'll see the door." - I see. Do not go in there, go ahead, there will be another door. You also do not enter, go on. You will fall into a small narrow corridor, from it directly and rested in the kitchen. And before you it. - She is? - Yes. - Clear? - I'll deal. Thank you. Can? Heck! Ponastavili something. - Tell me, please... - Ah! - Katya, the Katechka. - A-ah! "Why are you shouting?" - What? "What is it?" - Bandit. "Where?" - In the bathroom. - Do not you say. - Don't open! Open it! Look, I'm not a bandit. Go quickly to the police. - Maybe we'll figure it out ourselves? - Of course! In no case! Only over my dead body! I'm not a bandit, open it. I'll explain everything to you. Oh! - Feoktist Feoktistych. - I'm here. - Find out how many of them are there. - Hurry! You watch over here, and we'll go arm ourselves. Open it! If the bandits break open the door, rush at them and shout. "If I throw myself, then I will not go up." "You're a man." But he's also a man, let him go. I'm not a man, but a responsible planner! Stay! And the rest follow me. Listen, Comrade Feoktistych, if you do not open it to me, I'll crack the door. Apartment mad! Young people, keep in mind, I have hot weapons in my hands. BOLT Well? Open it! - Hello. - Comrade militiaman. "Where are the bandits?" "Right here in the bathroom." I'm the responsible tenant! Quiet, citizens. There are many of them. "Come out one at a time." All go out! All this is me alone. "What a cute one!" "How did you get here, citizen?" I came to Ivanova's Catherine Ivanovna. I thought so! "It's the first time I've seen it!" "Did you come to see her?" "I did not come to see her!" - Come on. - Correctly. I must change my clothes! Let her raise her hands. I'm not at fault. "I'll ask in the car." "Why into the car?" I'll explain everything to you. - Easy. - Yes, I will not go anywhere! - Hands up! "Comrade Lieutenant, addresses." So what? - All clear. - Will you answer me. Wait! Comrade chief. What's up, citizeness? Now one person in the car was taken away. For what? Little whether for what. Maybe he climbed into the apartment. Or maybe something worse. Then they can give it hard. And where did they take him to? "To the office." And you? He to you the friend? Or maybe a relationship? Familiar! No, the Komsomol characteristic is not needed. The case is clear. Then came your guys. Savelyev? I'm Saveliev. And Dubonos. "He's Dubonos." - Saveliev and Dubonos. Vouch. - We guarantee, of course. I also think you can believe. Good luck. So, citizens, the error occurred. You really excuse him, please. Excuse me, please. "Please, it's so romantic." If you need, come again. We will be glad. - No, thanks. - Nevertheless, vigilance remains vigilant. Vigilance has nothing to do with it. Next time fall in love with girls with the exact address and with a less common name. Clear? Girl, it's raining. "Well, let him go." "You would go home." And I do not have a home. "How is it not at home?" And like this. No. You know, send to me. I live not far, around the corner. I will not go anywhere. Come on. So you can catch cold. Take your suitcase. Quickly! Drink tea. Eat well, do not be shy. Thank you. And so the second cup already. - Warmed up? - Yeah. "Take the cheese, the sausage." Eat. "I do not want any more, I'm full." Thank you. Katya, you'll stay with me for the time being. The sister will not come soon. During this time you will have time to get settled to work. On. Many thanks. And what about grandfather, does he know anything about you? - No. - All the same the grandfather. I would be on yours I got a call from him. I sometimes call him, only I do not answer: If at work, it means he's healthy, - and then hang up. I myself am such, I will never start first if they offend me. The most insulting thing is that he told the truth. What am I like? Nothing. What did I achieve? Nothing, the morning is wiser than the evening. Most importantly, you need to get a job. FUNNY MUSIC So I'm to blame too, since you could have thought that. Thank you. But I never told you about love. "They do not talk about love, everything is said about it." It's only in the song it's sung. "Did you go to the movies?" Twice. So what? - Did you invite me to dances? - He invited me. Kissed. "When?" - How when? - Once. Three! "What does it matter, Klava?" Maybe you love? Uncomfortable, people are looking around. You can not order a heart. Do not cry, Klavochka. The girl, count us, please. "Did he find it?" "Whom?" Well, that they met on the train. No. Vakhter Ivanov listens. Hello. Katherine, is that you? Stop messing! Answer me! Are you silent? Well be silent. And your travel companion came to me. Prominent such a guy. I forgot his name. When he came? Oh, grandfather, hello. There's something with a pipe. Long. Just like you ran away. When will you return home, Katerina? Grandfather, I did not really get out of it, as soon as it comes out - right away I will come. I live well. I'm working. Do not worry about me. Now go home! Unlucky! What a fashion! From my grandfather to run. Katerina, can you hear me? I, I admit, showed Nonsense infinite: With all my heart I fell in love with the Doll. For her, love is fun, For me - torture. It is not necessary to impart, right, This value. Was it with me when the moon Pylko kissed? And now she was in me Disappointed. For her, love is fun, Everything seems to her a joke. Who gave her such a right To curse me? To forget she could All that is promised to me. You probably all can see In a poor heart a crack. For her, love is fun, For me - suffering. To her - to the left, to me - to the right. Well, goodbye. Well, here we are. "And tomorrow, Olenka, let's go to the cinema. "The two of you?" Together, I took the tickets for the last session. - Oh, also on the last one. - And what? No, I'll take a friend. And you take a friend. Well, Olenka, it's more interesting to watch a movie together. - Why is it more interesting? - Why, why... What is it for, Olya? We are only the second time with you we meet, but you are disgraceful. Not the second, but the third. It does not matter! There you are. Nate your flowers! Olya! I did not mean to offend you. I thought that... What did they think? Did not the girls ever beat you for such hooliganism? Never. On the contrary. So you and the bad girls met. Bye. Olya! I give you my word of honor that this is never more will not happen again without your permission. Olya, I can take it... I will take tickets for tomorrow for four, for the last session? May I, Olya? Can. I'll meet you at the cinema. Good. I'll see you off, or it's dark on the stairs. It is not necessary, I myself. Bye. Bye. "Katya, let's go to the cinema with us tomorrow." "I'm only going to stop you." What are you! He and Comrade will come. You will meet. "I do not need any comrade!" Katya, I'm asking. "For my sake, let's go." Not necessary. You are strange. This is Moscow! How will you find your Pasha? You do not even know his name. - Where are you? - Sorry. Well, how? Beautiful. Just look how she would not run away from you, either. Nothing. Mine does not run. She has a slightly different habit. Be kind, marshmallow box. Mitya, maybe I will not go to the movies with you? "She'll bring a friend." So what? I got 2 more addresses. For the first time in my life I asked you, and you can not. I can, but... We have another 50 minutes. Let's go to the same address. Fast? - Fast. - Let's go to. "Citizen!" - Thank you so much. Listen, it's open here. - Let's go to. - Pashka, remember the bathroom. I'm a scientist now. Nothing will happen, let's go. Can? Can? "Is there anybody here?" "Good people, respond!" So like this. Approximately this I expected. It's worse than the bathroom. Master! Is there anybody here? How he looks. You see? We'll be late. Look, she probably does not like talking to her loudly. Give then in an amicable way. Politely. She's a scholar. Ball, let me out. - Shurik. - A good dog. Why do not they go? Soon the beginning. "He must have forgotten." What are you! How can he forget? "What are we going to do now?" "What if it's bribed by her marshmallow?" "You do not take bribes." And we will try. Jigsaw, on! Take it. Like this. "Well, now go." - No, you go. - You fed, you go. - Let's go together. Let's go to. We walk. Olya, it's useless to wait. Let's go home. - No. I'll stay and tell him everything. - As you want. I will go. "Appetite is somehow inhuman!" The dog. What do I say to Ole? He will not believe it. "Listen, I have a plan." Throw her a marshmallow. While she is eating, I will put out the light, and in the dark we'll get through. It's an idea. Come on. "Only be calmer, Pasha." Laechka. Ay! People! Ay! Hold it! "Olenka, I'll explain everything to you." I waited for you only in order to say that you do not dare to come to me, nor to write, nor to call! Forget my name and the day when you paid for me in the trolley! Listen to me, Olya! No, we need young cadres, and they should be with us. "You are an incorrigible dreamer." Elizaveta Timofeevna, for the artist you need a fantasy. I'm a member of the artistic council. I'm fantasy absolutely not needed. We must introduce, not fantasize. Elizaveta Timofeevna, look at what a charming girl. I find nothing charming. Girl, you and your appearance could find a more interesting lesson. You went somewhere, well, go! "No, God forbid!" You do not like me understood. I want to offer you an interesting and serious job. The evening toilets created by the artists-fashion designers are shown our experimental studio. Elizaveta Timofeevna! Lusia fell ill, and I can not demonstrate your model. What did the simulant tell you? She said that she had a temperature of 39.2. She has a temperature, and we have - artistic advice. Ivanova, be here. The size of it. You will be shown. What are you, I do not even know how to walk like this! A Soviet girl must walk bravely in what we are implementing. I was told that I will only show working clothes. I have a heart break every 5 minutes. First of all you should not disrupt the work. Do you want to become a rifleman? No, but Elizabeth... "Take her into the cabin." Come along, Katya, come on. Elizaveta Timofeevna, how is it? At the level. Even better, than I expected. Elizaveta Timofeevna, here this cutout large. I feel awkward. Why do you speak out, you're not a member of the artistic council. Go immediately. - There's nobody... - Go ahead. Clean all your hands and do not fall down the stairs. "Has he really kicked you out?" No. I shouted only: "I do not have" granddaughter! If you come again, I will call the police. "Crazy" some kind of. And she's probably all into it. - Listen, Mitya! - What? - This girl is so similar to Katya. - What? "This one's in white." "They've done it." Visions begin. She is so similar, only slightly taller. Listen, Pasha, quit this quest. You will not give up - you will end badly. What did she give you? Look, so many girls go. Kate! This is my model! Ivanova! Are you mad? "Where is she going?" Why did she escape? Surround! Catch up! CROWN OF PEOPLE. "Katya, where are you going?" "Stop her!" - Hold the dress! - It's impossible! I have to chase young people for all the streets! You see, I saw him and ran, I could not restrain myself! And then at will. What, really kicked out? What are you! I myself. They scolded me a little, but nothing like that. You know, Olya, I do not like it there, I do not like it. "What are you going to do now?" I do not know. To leave, whether that... Well, the news is what. You know, I can arrange you. We need a courier at work. I'll talk tomorrow. Olenka, thank you. Again you help me out. "Well, how's your mood?" - Good. See that everything is neat. Tea is warmer, there is not enough tea. - Okay. - People will drink to the break tea and again for work. Olenka, what are you all writing? We write different papers and consider different figures. - And why all these papers? - Funny you. Above our office is another office, which is more important than ours. She sends us her paper, we rewrite them and send them to the office, which is below ours. I do not understand. Why the office, which is higher than ours, can not paper directly to send to the office below? That's strange. Have tea. Semyon Semyonovich, take the tea on me, I'll go now. Thank you. Ivanova, the boss is very busy. Put the glass on the table and quietly go away. Do you understand? I see. Thus, in general... - Have you written it? - Wrote. Timeliness of turnover of incoming directives is timely and occurs exactly in its time. Ivanova. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Take the package and go to the construction site. On the construction site? Listen, girl, do you all know here? "Everyone and everything, but what?" You have one friend working here. We do not have one friend, we have hundreds of them! - Why do you need him? - Never mind. You remember, we do not give ours to the side. Do you carry packages? - Packages! - Well, drag your bureaucracy! Do not freak out! To whom is the package? The foreman. Where is he? Go there! Stop! "Bruised, daughter?" There is nothing. How did you manage so much? "I need a foreman." I'm a foreman. Oh, finally! I have a package for you. Personally. Urgently. ABOUT! I knew this news a week ago. Sit there, rewrite directives. And with the armature again let down! Come on, dear... your book, sign it. And who needs this office? Our office is a necessary link in a complex chain relations between the commander-in-chief and construction sites. In due time we timely signaled. And I think timely raise the issue of timeliness of compression our apparatus. We do not have to squeeze, we need to expand. You do not agree, Comrade Komarinsky, that your office has become an extra instance? Strongly disagree. This is how you say - not superfluous? We are at the construction site only "superfluous" and scolded. "Extra level", "superfluous office". With shame, you can burn out. And you know how much this extra authority. Official tea drinks? Rubles for 500 per month. Demagogy. Irresponsible speech. - Olya! - Hello, Mitya. Excuse me, I'm in this form. Our institution was closed down. - Hello, Olya. - Hello. So you are now a working class too. - I accidentally got into your construction site. - It's great that you fell precisely on our construction site! Want to join us in the team an ancillary? I can talk. Where? To the installers. Upward. The work is not difficult. Tool bring, then yeah. And beautiful! Swifts fly. Will you stay with us? Queen of the air. Thank you. And you will be the king there? No, the deputy. Now! But these days I only think about you. - All the time? - All the time. Five times a day past your house I go. Why did not you come? And how do I go, if you forbade me to walk to you, to call and even write? Little did I say anything. And I was afraid. Wait a minute! What is that? Ivan Romanovich, this is patronage over the newcomers. So let's be in charge - we will not build a house in 10 years. It's to blame. "Well, march into place!" In 5 minutes train 72 is sent. "Moscow-Irkutsk". Here's your car! You, Katerina, do not forget that you have a grandfather. Grandfather, do not worry, I'll write. When you arrive, immediately give a telegram. With the exact address, otherwise disappear again. Here's to you. Letters from you can not wait, but you can scratch a postcard: I'm alive, they say, I'm healthy, which is what I wish for you. There are 50 pieces, in reserve. Katya, can not you stay? We will work with you again. No, I decided so decided. "Do you know what Mitya told me?" They will take me to their brigade. I'll be the queen of the air. No, the queen is not a profession. You go to the plastering, this is the case. What are you looking back? I asked Mitya to come here, but it's all gone. Will be to him today from me. You're late! You, Catherine... I am with you from the bottom of my heart. - What do you mean, grandfather! - All right! About the address do not forget, unlucky. I will not forget. You take care of yourself. Olenka, thank you for everything. Katya, do not forget me, write. Late! And all because of you! "Let's call on one more address!" Looking for last year's snow! Last time. Mitya! She is! "Who?" Kate! Kate! Kate! Pasha! "I've been looking for you all over Moscow. "I thought you'd forgotten me." I turned all Moscow, but you are not. "Citizen, get off the footboard." One minute... "Citizen, get out!" "I beg you very much." "Citizen, do not break it." I love this girl! - You can love, you can not break! - Well, do not bother! Yes. "Where are you going, Katya?" - Long away. To work. - What about me? Stay here! "I must go!" - What for? What should I do? "We'll go together." Decide, the train is on. "The train is really coming." Where are your things? Let's go, do you hear? - Katya, jump. - I'm afraid. A suitcase! Oh, Pashenka, I did the wrong thing, I must go. "Are they too late, young people?" No, on the contrary, we had time. - Let's go to? - Let's go to.
