The Magic Flute. Help me, or I am lost. There is no escape from this serpent. Closer and closer it comes. Someone help me! Die, monster by our power. Victory! Our heroic deed is accomplished. Our courage has saved him. He's a handsome youth. I've never seen such a fine-looking man. As lovely as a picture. If I were to love anyone... ...It would be this young man. Let's hurry to our Queen... ...and tell her our news. This may be the man... ...to restore her peace of mind. I'll stay here while you go and tell her. No, you go. I shall watch over him. No, I'll guard him on my own - I'll stay here. - I'll watch over him I'll stay. No, I shall. Why should I go? It's a ploy. She wants to be alone with him. That cannot be. I'd give anything to be with this young man. If only I had him to myself. But no one will leave, so it cannot be. It's best if I go now. You charming young man, farewell... ...until we meet again. Where am I? Am I only dreaming I'm still alive? Has a higher power saved me‚Äù? What is that? I'm the merry bird-catcher. A familiar sight to young and old. I know how to set a trap and whistle like a bird. I can be happy and cheerful... ...for all the birds belong to me. If I had a net for girls I'd catch them by the dozen. I'd keep them by me in a cage... ...and they'd all be mine. If all the girls were mine... ...I'd swap them for sugar I'd give the sugar to the one I loved the best. If she gave me a loving kiss we'd be man and wife. She'd sleep at my side... ...and I'd cradle her like a child. Tell me, who are you? Me? Silly question. I'm a human being like you. What if I asked who you were? I'd answer that I am of princely blood. That's beyond me! My father rules many lands and peoples... ...so I am called a prince. Lands, peoples, prince? Does that mean there are more people on the other side of these mountains? - Thousands and thousands. - Then I can sell more of my birds I catch all kinds of birds... ...for the blazing star queen and her maidens. They reward me every day with food and drink. Blazing star queen? Could that be the Queen of Night? Have you been lucky enough to see this goddess of the night? See? See the blazing star queen? What mortal eyes have ever seen through her web of dark veils? Why are you looking at me so suspiciously? Were you really the man who saved me... from that poisonous shake? Snake? - But you have no weapons. - Don't need any. A twist of the hand is all it takes. So did you strangle it? Strangled! Papageno! - Who are these ladies? - I don't really know myself I only know that every day they take my birds... ...and give me wine, cakes and sweet figs in return. Lovely ladies, here are my birds. Instead of wine... ...for the first time the Queen sends you pure, clear water. Instead of cake, this stone. And instead of sweet figs, this padlock for your mouth. So that you don't lie to strangers in future. So that you don't claim others' heroic deeds as your own. Speak up, did you fight this snake? Young man, we rescued you. Don't be afraid, you will be blessed with happiness. - Our Queen sends you this painting. - It is her daughter's portrait. If you are moved by what you see... ...then honour and good fortune await you. The beauty of this portrait has captured my heart. Something stirs in my heart when I look at this heavenly face. I can't say what it is but it burns me like a flame. Can this be love? Yes, it is love. If I could find her, if she were standing before me... ...with pure-hearted devotion I would... ...would what? In rapture I would press her to my breast. Then she would be mine forever. Nothing stands in the way of your happiness. The Queen has heard your every word. She has seen into your heart. She said, "If this young man's courage is the equal of his love... "...then my daughter will surely be rescued." - Rescued? - An evil demon has kidnapped Pamina. One lovely day in May she was sitting alone in the cypress grove... ...when Sarastro crept in, unseen. He lives nearby but his castle is closely guarded. Come, maidens, lead me there. I swear on my life to rescue Pamina. What's that? Don't be afraid! That heralds our Queen's arrival. My dear son, do not be afraid. You are innocent, upright and wise. A man like you can best console a mother's grief-stricken heart. I am condemned to grief since my daughter has gone. All happiness disappeared with her. An evil man stole her from me. I can still see the way she shook with fear... ...and how hopelessly she struggled. I had to witness her abduction. "Help me!" was all she said. She pleaded in vain for I was too weak to help. You will go and rescue her. You are the man to save my daughter. If I see you triumph then she will be yours forever. Did I imagine everything? What a punishment! He can no longer speak. All I can do is offer my sympathy, for I am powerless to help. The Queen has pardoned you. - Now Papageno can chatter again. - Chatter, but not lie - I'll never tell a lie again. - Let this be a warning to you. If every liar had a padlock on his mouth... ...hatred and slander would give way to love and friendship. Prince, accept this gift from our Queen. The magic flute will protect you... ...and support you in adversity. You will have the power to change men's hearts. The downcast will smile... ...the loveless will love. A flute like this is beyond price... ...for it can bring peace on earth. Fair ladies, allow me to take my leave. You may, but the Queen commands you... ...to go with the prince to Sarastro's castle. No, thanks! You said that he's a beast I'm sure he'll have me plucked, roasted and fed to the dogs. The prince will protect you and you must serve him. The prince can go to the devil I'd like to go on living I'm sure he'll sneak away from me. Take this treasure. - What's inside? - A set of chiming bells. Shall I be able to play them too? Of course. Silver bells and a magic flute protect from danger. Farewell... ...until we meet again. Can you tell us, fair ladies... ...where to find the castle? Three boys, fair and wise... ...will journey with you. As they lead you on your way... ...follow only their advice. - Pretty little dove, come to me. - Oh, what torture. - Your life is over. - I'm not afraid of death I am sad only for my mother. She will surely die of grief. Slaves, tie her up! My hatred will destroy you. Let me die, you monster, if nothing can touch your heart. Away! Leave me alone with her. I wonder where I am. Someone's there. I'll be brave and go ahead. Pretty lady, with the chalk-white face. That must be the devil. Have mercy! Spare me! - Who are you? - The blazing star queen sent me. My mother! What's your name? I've heard of you, but never seen you. - Nor I you. - Then do you know my loving mother? If you are the blazing star queen's daughter, then yes. - That is who I am. - I'll just check. Dark eyes, correct. Lips, red. Hair? Yes, hair. Everything matches except the hands and feet. That's my picture. How did you come by it? I was just about to hand over my birds... ...when I came across a man who called himself prince. Your mother was so taken with this prince... ...that she sent him your portrait and commanded him to rescue you. His decision was as instant as his love for you. Is he in love with me? You've been very brave. If Sarastro... - What time is it? - Nearly nightfall. Then there's no time to lose Sarastro usually returns from hunting around this time. - Wasn't that Sarastro? - No, Monostatos. Let's go. What if this is a trap... ...and this man is one of Sarastro's evil spirits? An evil spirit? I'm the nicest spirit in the world. Forgive me, I can see you have a kind heart. That's not much good to me when I still don't have a Papagena. Don't you have a wife? Not even a girlfriend, let alone a wife. Be patient, and Heaven will look after you... ...and send you a girlfriend sooner than you think. If Heaven could hurry up. If you can feel love then you must have a kind heart. It is a woman's duty to share this natural feeling. We all long for love, for love is the reason for living. Everything that lives makes sacrifices for love. It stands at the centre of the circle of life. This lofty goal clearly shows... ...that nothing is more noble than man and woman. Godliness is the goal to which man and woman strive. This is the path to your goal, but you must battle like a man. Listen to our words: Be steadfast, patient and impassive. Tell me if I shall succeed In rescuing Pamina. We cannot reveal that. Be steadfast, patient and impassive. Simply be a man. Then you will triumph manfully. May their words be engraved forever upon my heart. Where am I? Is this the home of the gods? The signs are that wisdom, industry and art abide here. In the realm of diligence, evil is disarmed. Fearlessly I go forward. My aim is noble, honourable and pure. Tremble, villain. My task is to save Pamina. Stand back! Stand back? Then I'll try my luck here. - Stand back. - Here too I'm turned back. Here is another door. Perhaps I'll find a way in. Stranger, what are you seeking on this holy ground? The reward for love and virtue. These are lofty words. Yet how will you find such things? You are not led by love and virtue but by death and anger. - Anger against an evil man. - You will not find him here. Does Sarastro reign here? Yes, Sarastro reigns here. But not in the Temple of Wisdom. He reigns in the Temple of Wisdom. So it is all hypocrisy. Will you leave so soon? I shall leave, happy and free and never see your temple. Say what you mean. You have been misled Sarastro lives here, that is enough for me. If you love your life, stay and speak. - Do you hate Sarastro? - I hate him for eternity. Tell me why. He is a monster, a tyrant. What proof is there? The proof lies in an unhappy woman's grief. Has a woman bewitched you? Women do little and talk a lot. Do you believe what they say? Let Sarastro show you his purpose. His purpose is all too clear. Did he not snatch Pamina from her mother? That is true. Where is she, whom he stole from us? Has she been sacrificed? I am not yet permitted to tell you this. Explain, don't trick me. I am sworn to silence. When will all be clear? When you take the hand of friendship... ...and join the eternal brotherhood. When will this endless night be over? When will my eyes see the light? Soon, young man... ...or never. Soon or never? Unseen voices, tell me if Pamina is alive. Pamina is still alive. She's alive! Thank you. If only every note I play... ...could tell of the gratitude... ...that springs from my heart. What power is in your magic music... ...If even wild beasts are charmed. Yet Pamina alone does not come. Pamina, hear me. In vain. Where can I find you? That's Papageno's tune. Perhaps he's already seen her. Perhaps he's bringing her here. Perhaps the tune will lead me to her. Swift feet and brave hearts will save us from the enemy. Unless we find Tamino they'll catch us again. Fair youth! No, here's a better way. What joy! Tamino has heard us and played in reply. Let's hurry to find him. Hurry, hurry, hurry. I've caught you! Bring the manacles! I'll teach you some manners. Trick Monostatos? Slaves, bring the chains. We're done for. Fortune favours the bold. Let the chimes ring and make their ears hum. What a lovely tune! I've never heard anything like it. If everyone had chimes like these... ...his enemies would vanish. Then he would live in true harmony. The harmony of friendship Is what soothes our troubles. Without this accord there can be no happiness on earth. Long live Sarastro! What can that be? I'm frightened. Now we're in trouble. Sarastro is coming. If I were a mouse, I'd run and hide. If I were as small as a snail I'd creep Into my house. What shall we say? The truth... ...even if we have done wrong. Long live Sarastro! We joyfully give ourselves to him. May he always live in wisdom. He is the one we worship and revere. Lord, I am guilty. I wished to escape your rule. But I am not to blame Monostatos craved love... ...So I ran away. Rise, and have no fear... ...for I know what is in your heart. You love another. I would not compel you to love, but I shall not set you free. I have a duty to my mother. She is in my power. All joy would leave you if I released you into her hands. A mother's name is sweet to hear. She is mine. She is a woman of pride. A man must guide your heart. Without a man a woman cannot fulfil her destiny. Come here, proud young man, here is our master, Sarastro. - It is he. - It is she I can hardly believe it. It is she. It's not a dream - I embrace him. - I embrace her. No matter if this means death. Such insolence! Separate them at once. I bend the knee before you. Make the sinner repent. He tried to use this strange bird... ...to steal Pamina from you. But I was able to find him. You know how vigilant I am. You will be well rewarded. Give this gentleman... Your favour is reward enough. No more than seventy-seven strokes. I had not hoped for that. Do not thank me, it is my duty. Long live the wise Sarastro! He justly rewards and punishes. Lead these two strangers into the Temple of Trials. Cover their heads... ...for first they must be purified. When virtue and justice mark the path of great men... ...then earth is a kingdom of heaven... ...and mortals become divine. You who are dedicated to the great gods Osiris and Isis... ...know that our gathering today is of great solemnity Tamino is waiting at the gate of our temple. He wishes to tear the veil of darkness and look into the light. Let your duty today... ...be to offer him the hand of friendship and guard this man of virtue. - Is he virtuous? - He Is. - Humble? - He is. - Charitable? - He is. Do you consider him worthy? The gods have chosen for Tamino the gentle, virtuous Pamina. This is why I took her away from her proud mother. This woman believes IN her own greatness. She hopes to use deception and superstition... ...to ensnare the people and destroy our temple. She must be stopped Tamino will make us stronger... ...and when he has joined us he will punish this wickedness. We acknowledge the wisdom of your words... ...but, if I may be so bold... ...will Tamino be strong enough for the trials that await him? - He is a Prince. - More than that... ...he is a man. But what if he should lose his life? Carry out your sacred task... ...and teach the duty of mankind. Teach them to recognise the might of the gods. Isis and Osiris, grant wisdom to the young couple. You guide the wanderers' steps. Fortify them with patience. Allow them to see the fruits of their ordeal. If they should go to their deaths... ...reward their courage and welcome them into your home. You stand before the temple where your courage will be tested. You can still withdraw. One step more and it will be too late. May wisdom be my victory, Pamina my reward. Will you submit to every trial? Every one. Your hand. Are you also prepared to struggle to attain wisdom? No thanks. Struggling isn't for me. I don't actually want any wisdom either I'm a simple man... ...happy with sleeping, eating and drinking. Now if I could find a nice little wife... You will never find her if you do not undergo our trials. What do these trials involve? Submitting to all our laws without flinching from death I'll stay single. What if Sarastro had a girl for you who was exactly like you? Like me? Is she young? Young and beautiful. What's her name? I wouldn't mind a look at her, just out of curiosity. You can see her, but not say a word. Can you keep silent? Yes, I can keep silent. Your hand. You shall see her. Your trials have begun. The first duty of the Initiates... ...Is to beware the wiles of women. Many wise men have let themselves be taken in. They have found their trust repaid with rejection. They wrung their hands in vain. Death and despair were their reward. Bring some light over here! Well, that's great! Be patient, and consider this the will of the gods. What are you doing in this terrible place? You'll never get out of here. Tamino, you're going to die Papageno, you are lost. - No, that's going too far. - Papageno, will you be quiet! Are you going to break your vow not to talk to women? - They said we're done for. - I said, be quiet! I'm always being told to be quiet. The Queen is close at hand. She has crept into the temple. - In the temple? - Keep silent. Can't you keep your promise? Tamino, you are doomed. Think of the Queen. Rumours abound about these false priests. A wise man does not listen to what the rabble has to say. They say that if you join them you go straight to hell. To the devil! Outrageous! Tell me, Tamino: Is that true? The invention of hypocrites, repeated by women. The Queen says it too. She thinks like a woman. Be quiet, my word should be enough. Think of your duty and use your head. Why are you so unfriendly? Papageno is saying nothing either. I'd like to... Silence! You see I can't... I'm ashamed that I can't stop blabbing. Yes, you should be ashamed. We must leave them. Neither one will talk. A resolute man thinks before he speaks. Our sanctuary has been profaned. Send these women down to hell. Young man, your resolve has triumphed. Come onward on our journey. On your feet, Papageno I've fainted. Pull yourself together and act like a man. If there's a Papagena for me... ...what's the point of all this danger? I must lead you onward. All men respond to the pleasures of love. Why shouldn't I just because no one likes my face? Don't I have a heart? Am I not made of flesh and blood? It would be hell to spend my life without a woman to love. I long for some tenderness I have a lovely woman in mind. She is beautiful, I must kiss her. Moon, turn away. If you don't like what you see... ...then shut your eyes. Mother? Mother! Where is the young man I sent to you? He has renounced the world for ever... ...and joined the Initiated. The Initiated? Unhappy daughter, now you are lost to me for ever. Lost? Let us run away, mother. If you protect me I can face any danger. My dear child, I can no longer protect you. My power came to an end when your father died. Your father gave the Sevenfold Circle of the Sun to the Initiated. He said to me: "My wife, my final hour has come "I leave all my riches to you and your daughter. "But Sarastro will guard the Circle of the Sun as resolutely as I have done. "Do not seek what is beyond a woman's grasp. "Your duty is to place yourself and your daughter... "...under a wise man's guidance." Then I have lost the young man for ever. Lost! Do you see this blade? It has been sharpened for Sarastro. You are to kill him and bring me the Circle of the Sun. - But mother! - Not another word. My heart is on fire with all the vengeance of hell. Death and despair blaze around me. Unless you put Sarastro to death... ...you are no longer my daughter. You will be forsaken for ever... ...all ties of nature severed, unless you kill Sarastro. Gods of vengeance, hear a mother's vow. Am I to commit murder? I cannot. What should I do? Place your trust in me. Is it my love you fear, or your murderous intent? - You know about it? - I know it all. There is only one way to save yourself and your mother. - What would that be? - To give your love to me. Then your life is over. Master, they vowed to kill you. I wanted to avenge you I know only too well that your soul... Away with you! This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine. Do not punish my mother. Have no fear. You will see how I take vengeance on your mother. In this sacred place vengeance is unknown. If a man succumbs, love restores him to his duty. Then, led by friendship, he joyfully enters a better land. Within these sacred walls, where hearts are filled with love... ...there can be no traitors, for we forgive our enemies. Those who resist this faith bring shame upon humanity. We leave you both here. Remember to keep silent. Those who break the rule of silence here... ...are punished by the gods with thunder and lightning. Goodbye! This is a lot of fun! I wish I were in my straw hut or in the woods. At least then I'd hear some birdsong. I'll just have to talk to myself. We can talk to each other. We're men, after all. They don't even give you a drop of water... ...let alone anything else. - Is that for me? - Yes, my angel. Water! Firewater! Is this how you look after all your guests? I bet you don't get many guests then. Very few. I can imagine. Sit down with me. I have plenty of time on my hands. - Tell me, how old are you? - Eighteen years and two minutes. You young angel! Do you have a boyfriend? - Certainly do! - Is he the same age? No, he's about ten years older. That must be true love. - What's his name? - Papageno. So where is this Papageno? - Right here, my angel. - Am I your boyfriend? What are you called then? I'm called Papagena. I'll certainly keep my mouth shut now. Once more we welcome you in Sarastro's realm. He returns the flute and chimes... ...that were taken from you. If you enjoy this food then eat your fill. At our third meeting great joy will reward your courage. Be brave, Tamino. Your goal is not far off. Papageno, keep silent. Tamino, shall we have something to eat? You play, I'll eat. Tamino, you are here? I heard your flute, and ran toward the sound. Are you down-hearted? Have you nothing to say to your Pamina? Am I to leave you alone? Don't you love me any more? Don't you love me? Papageno, tell me what the matter is. My only, beloved Tamino. This is worse than death. This is worse than death. I feel the happiness of love has vanished forever. My heart will never know happiness again. Look, beloved Tamino, my tears fall for you alone. If there is no love in your heart... ...then I shall find peace in death. See, I can keep my mouth shut too, when I need to. When it comes to it... ...I can be a man, too. O Isis and Osiris, what joy! The radiant sun will chase away the sombre night. Soon the noble youth will feel reborn. Soon he will be one of us. He is bold and pure of heart. Soon he will be worthy of us. Prince, you have shown manly resolve. Now there are two paths full of danger that you must follow. Bring Pamina. Where am I? What is this terrifying silence? - Where is Tamino? - He is waiting to bid a final farewell. - Tamino. - Stand back. - Shall I never see you again? - You will greet each other in joy. Terrible dangers await you. May the gods watch over me. The thought that you will not survive fills me with dread. The gods' will be done, their bidding is a command. If you loved as I love, you would not be so distant. I feel just as you... ...and shall be true to you for ever. - The time has come to bid farewell. - What pain it is to part. - Tamino must go. - Pamina, I must go. - Farewell. - Hurry on your way. - The time has come. - May we find happiness once more. Farewell. We three shall meet again. Are you going to leave me all alone? If only I knew where I was and how I got here! You deserve to wander forever in the dark caverns of the earth... ...but the gods have spared you. Now you will never share... ...In the divine joys of the Initiated. Well, there are plenty more people like me. Now what I'd love is a nice glass of wine. - Do you wish for nothing else? - Not so far. You will be served. That was quick! I'm so happy I could fly up to the sun, if I had wings. I feel all warm inside. What I'd really like is... What would I like? Papageno would like a little wife for himself. Someone warm and tender would be bliss for me. I'd feel like a prince and eat and drink my fill I could live like a wise man and feel I was in heaven. Isn't there one single girl who finds me attractive? If no one will help me, I'll surely die of grief. If no one will love me, the flame of love will kill me. A kiss from a woman's lips would bring me back to life. Here I am, my angel. Have you taken pity on me? - Yes, my angel. - That's a stroke of luck. If you promise to be true to me for ever... ...then you'll see how tenderly your wife will love you. Not so fast, young angel. This requires some thought. Take my advice. Don't hesitate. Give me your hand, or you'll be imprisoned here for ever. - Imprisoned? - You'll have bread and water every day. You'll have to live without friends and renounce the world. Drink water? Renounce the world? I'd rather have an old lady than none at all. You have my hand and the guarantee... ...that I'll be true for ever... until I find someone nicer. - Is that a promise? - It's a promise. On your way, young woman. He is not yet worthy of you. Stand back. Let the earth swallow me first. The rising sun heralds the coming dawn. Superstition must be swept away and wisdom triumph. May peace descend and enter human hearts. Earth will join the kingdom of heaven and mortals be like the gods. See, Pamina is in distress. Where is she? She's troubled by her rejection. Let us console her. I'm concerned about her fate. If only her young man were here. She is coming. We'll stand back and watch what she does. Shall I give my life to you? You will end my pain. What is she saying? She is losing her mind Patience, I am yours. Soon we shall be united. Her mind is in turmoil. She means to kill herself. Fair maiden, look at us. I want to die, because the man I can never hate... ...has left his beloved. My mother gave me this. God will punish your suicide. Better to die like this... ...than be destroyed by sorrow. Mother, your curse pursues me. Will you come with us? Is there no end to my grief? Farewell, deceitful man. You have ended Pamina's life. - Let this blade kill me. - Stop! It would kill him if he saw this... ...for he loves only you. If he loves me, why did he turn away from me? Why did he not speak to me? We may not tell you, but we shall show him to you. You will see that for you he braves death. - Let us go to him. - Lead me to him. Human frailty cannot keep two loving hearts apart. The enemy toils in vain, for the gods protect those who love. The man who carries his burden along this path... ...Is purified by fire, water, air and earth. If he can conquer the fear of death... ...he will ascend into heaven. Enlightenment will come upon him... ...and he can dedicate himself to Isis. Death does not deflect me from the path of virtue. Open wide the gates of terror and let me set forth. Stop, Tamino - I must see you. - Is that Pamina's voice? Yes, it's Pamina's voice. Now she can accompany me, no fate can part us... ...even if death is what awaits us. May I speak to her? You may speak to her. What joy to see her again, to walk together into the temple. A woman unafraid of night and death... ...Is worthy to join the Initiates. My Tamino! What joy. My Pamina! What joy. These are the gates of terror that threaten danger and death. I shall never leave your side. I shall lead you, while love is my guide. It will strew the way with roses, for no rose is without a thorn. Play your magic flute So it protects us on our way. In an enchanted hour... ...my father hewed it from a thousand-year-old oak... ...while thunder and lightning raged. Come and play the flute so it leads us on our fearful way. By the power of its music we walk in joy through death's dark night. We passed through fiery flames and stood firm against danger. May the music protect us in water as it did in fire. Gods, Isis has smiled upon us. Triumph, noble couple. You have overcome danger. You now belong to the fellowship of Isis. Come, enter the temple. Little wife! Little dove! My beauty! No use, she's gone. I never have any luck I was wrong to keep chattering and it serves me right. Since I tasted that wine... ...since I saw the pretty woman... ...my heart has been on fire... ...tingling here, tingling there... Papagena, my sweet. My little dove. It's no use. I'm fed up with my life. If I die, that will be the end of love. I'll hang a noose from this tree... ...and put it around my neck I no longer care for life, so goodnight, cruel world. You've been unkind to me not sending me a pretty girl. Very well, I'm going to die. Pretty girls, remember me. Is no one going to take pity on me before I hang? I can always walk away. Just shout yes or no! No one heard me. Silence. Is that what you want? On you go, Papageno. Bring your life to an end. I'll wait a moment. I'll just count to three. One... Two... Three... Very well, then. As there is nothing to stop me, goodnight, cruel world. Papageno, don't be stupid. You only live once. That's all very well for you to say, but if you felt like me... ...you'd want a girlfriend too. Then set your chimes ringing. That will bring your wife to you. What a fool! I forgot the magic instrument. Play, glockenspiel. I want to see the girl I love. Play, little bells, send my girl this way. Papageno, behind you! - Are you all mine now? - I'm all yours now. - Be my beloved wife. - Be my sweetheart. What joy it will be if the gods remember us... ...and send us lovely little children. First a little Papageno. Then a little Papagena. - Then another Papageno. - Then another Papagena. There is no greater joy... ...than to be blessed with lots of Papageni. Hush, we'll soon break into the temple. Queen, remember your promise that your child will be my wife. It is my wish that my child will be your wife. I can hear an awesome roar. It sounds like the echo of distant thunder. They are now in the temple. There we shall attack them. We shall rid the earth of these hypocrites. To you, mighty Queen of Night... ...we dedicate our vengeance. Our power is destroyed. We are plunged into everlasting night. The sunlight drives away the night. It destroys the evil power of hypocrites. Hail, Initiates. You have broken through the darkness. We give you thanks, Osiris Isis, our thanks to you. Courage has triumphed. Beauty and wisdom are rewarded with an everlasting crown
