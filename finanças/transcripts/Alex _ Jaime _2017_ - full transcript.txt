Can I please have one person on my side, without having to beg? - Like tonight or for life? - Look, just try, okay? - Amy, listen, I'm sorry for being rude earlier. I really just wanna say I am happy for you, okay? So, if you'd just please refrain from kissing other guys... - Alex! - What, they don't know? - Can we not do this tonight? - Okay. What I was trying to say is, welcome to our incredibly dysfunctional family. You're gonna fit right in. - That is seriously the sweetest thing you've ever said to me. - Okay. Love you, bro. - You too. - Mm-hm. - And you, I guess. - He's sweet. - What? (lively rock music) - (sighs) Are you guys serious? Our older brother died of lung cancer, and you think it's a good idea to smoke here? (man chuckles) - Sorry, dude. - Thank you. One hour. (woman clears her throat) Hey. - You're... - You first. - Your brother died of lung cancer? - Oh, uh, yeah. This is how I remember him, it makes me feel closer. - What was his name? - Aron. - My brother's name was Carter, also in the past tense. I only bring that up 'cause he died of lung cancer too. Do you mind? - Uh, yeah, not at all, go ahead. - How old was Aron when he passed? - 20, and Carter? - Also 20. - Sadly, it seems like we already have so much in common. - Yeah, dead family members and having brown hair. I'm weak. - How'd you know? - One of the guys you kicked out of here went to apologize to your brother for smoking. - Narc. All right, so I'm guessing, you don't have a dead brother either? - You'd be right. - So, what're you doing out here? - Well, I was outside, talking to a guy named Gary about his job as a corporate accountant for Kaiser Permanentic. Yeah, I thought accountants were aware that nobody wants to hear about their job. Then your brother made a quick announcement, apologizing for the lowlife on the patio who's gonna die alone. I thought, you know, that sounds like more fun. So, why don't you wanna be here? - Well, we've all gathered here to celebrate two people who made a plan to celebrate this same shit in the future. So, it's a little redundant, in my opinion. - Cynical. - Inside every cynical person, there's a disappointed idealist. - Hemingway? - Close. George Carlin. (chuckles) So, what are you doing at this party? - I live across the street. Yeah, they invited me to be polite. I'm guessing they probably wanted to avoid that awkward conversation with the weird girl who's always home. - You're always home? - I work from home. - So is there a live-in boyfriend or a boyfriend in general? - Skipping the whole "I work from home" thing? - Well, I'm positive that it has something to do with the internet. You're probably like a food blogger or a YouTube celebrity. I mean, either way, I'd be disappointed, so. - Wow, okay, first, no boyfriend. Second, not a celebrity, I'm a translator. - Okay, so what was your last job? - The United Nations. - Oh, shit. That's something. Are you CIA, KGB? Be honest, are you a spy? - (chuckles) Okay, your turn. Impress me. - I am a line cook at a restaurant downtown, that is famous for steak sandwiches. - That's the moment you chose to be honest? Sexy. - I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu. - To make sandwiches. - Everyone likes sandwiches. You wanna get outta here? - (chuckles) What part of this conversation made you think I wanna leave with you? Just kidding.

(phone clicks) (distant thunder rumbles) - Jaime, stop! Can we go somewhere? - Why, are you gonna get out of bed? - I will. - You wanna go to Disneyland? - Anything. Seriously, we can go anywhere. I'll run your errands with you, I just wanna be with you. - I know, but you live with me. - Okay, so surprise me, then. I want mystery. - Wait, is this because I took a piss with the door open yesterday? (chuckles) - [Alex] Okay. - Alexandra. Hey. Look, I'm just finishin' up work emails, okay?

(distant thunder rumbles) On Fridays, all the foreign exchange kids would skip class and this one time, we go back to the dorms, and we were so drunk, I couldn't believe we made it, and everybody passed out, even though it was like seven PM. But I stayed up, talking to this German guy, Christian, who's actually the reason I started smoking. - Mm-hm! - And, uh, I don't know, it just happened. - And you were 19? - Mm-hm. I had dated before that, but, I was so awkward, I never really went very far. - Wow, really? - (chuckles) Yeah. So, when did you lose your V card? - I thought we weren't supposed to discuss numbers? - I didn't ask you for a number, I just asked you for the first one. - Yeah, I know, but you always get so weird about this kind of stuff. - Come on, you asked me, now go. How old? - 15, like a normal person. - Mm-hm, and to who? - This girl, Becky, a little neighborhood slut. (both laugh) And Jeff. - Wait, (chuckles) what? - Yeah. - [Waiter] Table's ready. - You care to fill me in on the details of that little number? (Jaime chuckles) You can't just drop something like that, like, "oh, I lost, my first time was a threesome." - Okay, okay. Yeah, so Becky was her name, and she convinced me to have a threesome with her and her goth-ass saxophone teacher. And he would come over every Thursday and supposedly teach her lessons, but her parents wondered why she wasn't getting any better and what they were paying him for. Anyway, we got really high, and hooked up in her dad's jacuzzi. - All three of you? - All three of us. Yeah. - (chuckles) What a creep! - Yeah, yeah, I guess he kinda was. But you know, I think he hooked up with a lot of his high school students. I wonder if he's still teachin'. - In prison. - In prison, probably, yeah. (chuckles) - It's so weird to look back at it like that. You know, like it makes me feel so old. - [Jaime] Right? I mean, I think about middle school kids doin' half the shit that I used to do. - Oh, they are children. - They're children, thank you. - Thanks. Children acting like idiots. - Yeah, well... - God, but it's so funny, 'cause at the time, you think you're so adult, you know? And looking back, it's like, no, I was a baby. I was actually a kid. - Right. I mean, I think about older people thinking of what I was doin' back then, just fuckin' and smoking weed. - For sure, your parents never caught you doing that shit? Like, at least your mom did, right? - But one time, my step dad caught me in his truck with this girl and he beat the shit out of me. - Oh, my god. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, they knew I was messin' around, but that was the first time anybody acknowledged it. - I'm sorry. - Well, I was used to it by then. - And you never knew your real dad? - As well as an eight-year-old knows anybody. - Is that how old he was when they got divorced? - No, they never did. He was hit by a train. - How does that even happen? - By standing in front of it? - [Alex] Oh. - Yeah. Well, my mom said it was a blessing in disguise. 'Cause he wasn't a very happy person, but then again, neither was she, so. - I'm so sorry. - Don't be. I mean, I turned out all right. - Oh, god. - Right, Alex? - Yeah! - Right? - Yeah, very well adjusted. - I turned out all right. - (chuckles) Idiot. (Jaime chuckles) Hey. They're gonna love you. - [Jaime] Your parents are nothing like you made them seem. - [Alex] I didn't wanna freak you out. - That was some nice light conversation we had goin' on in there. I never thought about building a wall at the border of Mexico. (Alex laughs) I'm sure that'll solve all of our problems. - Oh, fuck. I've never spoken to him that way before. - Yeah, well maybe nobody's spoken to him like that before. That's the problem. - That's the problem. That is definitely their problem. - That's definitely the problem. - Wow. - What? So, what do you wanna do? You wanna go home? Hm? - No. Fuck that. I feel too good to go home. - Oh! You feel too good to go home, hm? - Mm-hm. (Jaime chuckles) - Well... What should we do? Hm?

What're we gonna do with that? - Mm, compress it? - Oh, could we make a marinara? - With that? (Alex chuckles) - We grew that, bae! (Jaime chuckles) - (sighs) You know, it's time to roll. (Alex moans) Come on! I'll make you a special breakfast for your birthday, and then take you on a little adventure. - Where? - It's a secret adventure. - I don't like secrets. - Everyone likes secrets. - No, no! - I gotta go. - Come on! - [Jaime] I'm goin' to make you breakfast. - It's my birthday! (groans) Is this one of your hangover shakes? - Well, it's not my daddy issues we were drinking away last night. - (chuckles) Oh. - And this will keep you looking young, long after you should be. - Do I want that? - [Jaime] Everyone wants that. - [Alex] Oh, wait, can we not do the raw egg? - Why? It's good for you. Plus, Arnold told me to do it. - Well, I'm not trying to be a bodybuilder. - Do you realize how long it would take for you to actually look like that? - Okay, what about salmonella? - What about it? - It's in raw eggs! - No, it's in every 20,000 organic raw eggs. - Well... First, why do you know that? And second, I don't wanna take that chance. - Life is the chance. - Oh, really? - Yes. Life is the chance of dying. If you wanna be a fucking statician, your chances of getting shot to death, one in 325. Your chances of getting electrocuted, one in 5,000. Your chances of getting killed in a plane crash, also one in 20,000. So, no going back to Italy for you. - Okay, okay, we get it, we get it. (Jaime chuckles) I just like to keep my options open, if that's okay with you. - It's not okay with me. 'Cause that's your problem. You're so busy with the what-ifs, that you're not lookin' at the what-ares. - Oh, is that my problem? - That is your problem. - (chuckles) Oh, thank you for telling me. - Can I put this in the... - (sighs) Do it.

It's colorful. - Yeah? - Bravo, yeah. - Did you have to look that up in the dictionary, or did you have to find like an actual French prostitute? - You know what, Jaime, just stop it, okay? I didn't come here to fight you. God. (chuckles) Remember that, huh? - Yeah. - I thought you were gonna burn these in a witch circle or something. - Look, Alex, I'm not erasing you. Like I am not pretending like this never happened. - But you weren't perfect, either. - Well, no one's perfect, okay? So, you can get over yourself. - You're just coming at me from ego. Because you were blind-sighted, and I get it, it's fine. But just know that that's what you're doing. - You could just cut the shit, Alex. - I love you. Jaime. - Really? - [Alex] Yeah. - Why do you love me? - Why do I love you? - You see, you see? (chuckles) You do that. You repeat the questions just so you can like have more time to think and I hate that. Why don't you just say whatever is on your mind? Just like it's the first thing that comes out. - Yeah, because your shorts, they're cute and they're tight. - That's really romantic, Alex. - Yeah, okay, sorry. Just give me a second! - Okay, just ask me. - Ask you? - Mm. - (chuckles) Right, okay. So, why do you love me? - You're my nightmare. After I met you, my fears of snakes and spiders and heights, they just seemed so childish compared to my fear of you with someone else. And then... I saw what you did. And I realized that we don't share the same fear. - That is not fair. - Okay. - What, do you think you're so smart, interpreting what I was doing? Analyzing that somehow my definition of love is inferior to yours? - I didn't say that. - Yeah, but you think it, Jaime! You think, "oh, I wouldn't have done anything like that," because your feelings are so much more pure and noble. - Oh, fuck yeah! - You didn't think that you were gonna have to put any more work into this relationship? - Holy shit, oh, right. - Yeah, you say, no, look. You say that you love me. You say that you're afraid of losing me. And now what? You're done? - Look, I put in work, okay? I changed my fucking work schedule to fit yours. I cook for you, I clean for you. I chose to spend time with you. - Okay, you know what? God damn, spending time is not work. That is the good part. The real work in a relationship is the exhausting practice of working through the little shit that you hate about each other and trust me, Jaime, I have done the work. - Oh, really? - Yeah, really. - Okay. - Yeah. What I did shouldn't be a no-going-back mistake. - I think it's a matter of opinion. - It's completely irrational. The way that you were treating me and the way... - [Jaime] Oh, this is your fucking phone now. - My phone, what... - Yes, your fucking phone! You know, on that one thing, there are 1,000 different ways for you to cheat on me. And I hate that thing. Every time you are on it, I am wondering, who the fuck are you talking to? Who are you setting up your next fuck date with? - That's not what I was doing! - [Jaime] Okay, if only I could believe you. - Oh. - If the only thing I had to worry about was what you were doing when I wasn't around, I mean, that is one thing. But what you did... You were five feet away from me. - I was just talking. Okay? I was just talking. I wasn't... - I am sorry that I am, I want more in my life, Alex, I do. I am not obligated to stay in this rent-controlled rat box forever, just because I lowered myself to your fucking standards! - That is so fucked up. My standards are me. - No. - Jaime, no, my standards are me. - [Jaime] Do not get this twisted. - Hey, you know, why don't you go fuck one of your little rich buddies? You know, and see if they'll give the life that you wanted. Hm, Jaime? You know, I'm sorry that I am not sorry, but that shit doesn't matter to me. This whole little tough girl act, I know it's not you. And that you're just acting tough so that this hurts less. So let's just stop, okay? - You know, the only comfort I have in this, is knowing that you're gonna hurt a lot worse. - I'm sorry. All right? I was scared. I was scared, baby, I didn't, come on, please. What if our flag... - Hey. Leave my key on the table, all right? (Alex chuckles) - Fuck.

I mean, I'm not a professional, but, I've been doing it since I was nine, so I'm pretty good. But you know, the glory days of skating were really in the 90s. We didn't have a TV, but my mom's friend recorded like every single Winter Olympics from 1980s. So I would just watch them like over and over and over again and my favorite was Nancy Kerrigan. - Oh, she was the best. - She was the best! Aww, yeah, oh my god, I just do it now because I wanna stay in shape, plus the outfits, they're amazing. - Totally amazing. - Yeah! - The most amazing. Tonya Harding was my favorite, though. She really brought the competition down to their knees. - Wait, that's not funny. She was amazing, but she had demons. Wait, are you saying that because you think that you're funny or are you saying it to try to feign interest so that I'll sleep with you? - Would you be mad if I was just trying to sleep with you? - Probably not, but, oh my god. Let me tell you about the French judges. Don't even get me started. They are just so much, I just hate them. Oh my god, there's this one named Pierre. He is just, I just, oh my god. - What was Pierre like? - Don't even get me, oh. - Sorry, I'm just getting a Snapchat from my sensei. (chuckles) I was training hard last night. - Oh. What belt are you? - There are no belts in Muay Thai, actually. That is a common misconception. Muay Thai is more of a dance. It's beautiful, but it's also very deadly. It's violent, but I'm not training in it so I can kick some random guy's ass on the street, even though I could. I could. - Sure, yeah. Great, that's good. - But it's an art form and the Thai history is very rich. Have you ever seen the movie Ong-Bak? - What was that? - Ong-Bak. Ong-Bak. Thai movie, Tony Jaa? - No. - Man. - No, I don't think so. - Yeah, am I boring you? - No, no, not at all. - Okay. He's this Thai actor, super sick martial artist. And this whole thing is like, here, watch, I'll show you. So. (clears throat) - Oh, (chuckles) okay. - Come at me. - I'm sorry, you want me to come at... - Come at me. - (chuckles) I don't think... - Just stand up. - Oh, no, no thanks. - Come at me.

Were you like crazy teenagers? - No, we weren't crazy teenagers. - It was last year. - Yeah. - Yeah, nope, totally used to be punk rock. I was all into NOFX until they sold out. But I still steal stuff from Walmart. - That's hard, that's super hardcore, dude. (Alex chuckles) - We should go though, right? - Yeah, we're making spaghetti squash. He's trying to cut back on carbs. - Aww, dieting? - No. - It sounds like you're dieting. - I'm not dieting. - That's good. - I'm not dieting. - It's good for you. - It's a sweet squash, bro. - Yeah, sweet squash, bro. - Thanks, bro. - I do Muay Thai. - Oh, I'm an athlete too, I figure skate! - Really? - Yeah! - Solid, solid. - I can tell. - Yeah, oh wait, hold on.

(chuckles) (clears throat) Jaime, I must confess, I, kind of wrote these vows this morning. (clears throat) You always say that the first time I try something, I usually screw it up and you're usually right. But I got this one thing right. I usually try to play the cynic and find whatever's wrong with the situation, but now, this one time, I can't find anything wrong, because you're perfect. And I vow to always wave our flag together. To rob racists together. To plant our seeds together. And with my whole heart, I vow to always be grateful that I get to be the one that brushes your hair behind your ear. I love you. - I vow to support your dreams, however outlandish they may seem. I vow to make you smoothies when you are tired from cooking, and keep the statistics on the hold. I vow to be your rock when the tides are high, and your oak when the sun is hot. And your willow when the storms roll in. - Hey! What the hell? - Run, run! - Run! - I told y'all twice already!

Okay, the acceptance of the offering of their families that you have each other and the blessings of all these good people here with us today. (group chuckles) I now pronounce you husband and wife.

She just inherited a completely ungrateful, disrespectful, pain-in-the-ass daughter. And she doesn't even know it. - Such a good pain in the ass to have, though. - Aww. It only took you three-fourths of a decade to figure it out! - Yeah. (chuckles) (Jaime chuckles) Thank you. - You're welcome. For what? - For being cool with this whole thing. - Well, there was nobody to pay a dowry to, so your family can keep the goats.

Someday I just wanna get you the... - Stop. You're not my fairy godmother, this is the 21st century. - Yeah. (sighs) You know, I used to have to cater these, like, $100,000 weddings. Cooking for everybody. And I used to think what a ridiculous, extravagant waste of money they were, but also, I always thought that I was gonna waste that money on somebody, someday. - You also thought that marriage was an outdated and idiotic institution designed to make women property. - Well, they are. (Jaime chuckles) So, you're mine now. (both chuckle) (sighs) I have no idea what we're gonna do. - Well, we are at least bound legally now, so, no matter what happens, if one of us succeeds, the other will get something. - I like the way your mind works. - Yeah. (Alex chuckles) - Oh. I know we weren't supposed to do presents or anything, but I got you a little something. - You're breaking the rules. - It's really small, just take it. - [Jaime] Oh, it's beautiful. - It was my grandmother's. It was her St. Matthew's pendant. We weren't religious or anything, but, she always thought it had magical powers that kept her safe, and I... I liked the idea of you always being safe, so. - So, what is he, like, the patron saint of protection, or love or... - Accounting. (both laugh) Apparently, he was the Jewish tax collector who worked for the Romans. Grams never knew that, I just let her live in ignorance. - Got a St. Matthew, the Internal Revenue Saint. (both chuckle) - Don't go convertin' on me. - I love it, thank you. - [Alex] I'm glad you like it. - So, as long as we are already on that subject, I got you something too. - (gasps) You're breaking the rules too? - Birds of a feather. - Hm. - Here. - Aww. Thought I already had the key to your heart? - I will drown you in the ocean right now, you cheesy bastard. - Sorry. Key to the dog house, got it. - No, it's to a run-down shack on Mar Vista. - You're gonna keep me that far away now? - No. It's the old Husure. - The one that we were looking at? - Yeah. - Oh, my god. - It's gonna need some work, but, it's yours. - My restaurant? - Yes. - No, but we looked at it, we can't afford it. - I might have pulled some strings. - What strings? It was gonna be like four years before we had a down payment, we can't... - Maybe I took out a couple of loans, and we may have to move into the attic, and I may have told your dad it was for a real wedding. (Alex chuckles) - You lied to Roger? He's gonna be furious. - He deserves it. - He so deserves it. - Mm-hm. (Alex sighs) I believe in you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Alex. - [Alex] Yeah. - We still have to have our first official dance. - But we had it with Mr. Dance-A-Thon. - [Jaime] No, like the slow kind, silly.

Maybe you have been spoiled for the last 20 years. This is how we do it, Jaime. We get up, we put on our faces, and we go and do what needs to be done. - I don't know half those people out there. - [Woman] Well, they knew Alex. - I don't care. (sighs) - Alex was my child.

The award-winning culinary artist, was a fiery sex puppet. Because of his natural athleticism, he was simply out of my control. (laughs) Alex's sex life was lived outside of the bedroom. In the living room as well, and the garden, where you are all gathered today. Everything he did when it came to work, or that one half of a half-marathon, beginner's swing dancing, not paying bills on time, knowing what offsides means in football, and not being a cheating asshole like his dad, Roger. He did what he wanted without fear of failure, and did it well, a true bad ass. (chuckles) I loved Alex madly. I worshiped the... I loved Alex madly. I worshiped the ground my husband walked on. He truly just wanted one thing. He wanted to make sure I, Jaime, knew how much love he felt for me, and the infinite amount of love he tried to give back. He wanted me to know how beautiful the world became when he saw it through my eyes. And how he will be forever grateful for that. So, there you have it.

Jaime, you are a very talented writer. - Scary talented, I'm sure. (Alex chuckles) - You know what, can we just take this off? - [Jaime] Yeah. So, one more? - You're finally catching on. - Yeah. (Alex retches) (Alex groans) All of the thin ones were in the wash, I found this big guy. You know, just holler if you get too hot. Just let me know, all right? - Thank you, thank you. - Yeah, no problem. Alex. - Look, I'm fine, I promise. - No, I'm gonna go see if I can't find Barb. - No, don't. - Look, why not? - Will you just sit here with me, please? - She's probably still here. - Jaime, sit down.

(Alex chuckles) - I'm fine, nothing's wrong, I just, if you call her, the moment she comes in here, she'll give me something that puts me out and I don't want that right now. I'm having too good of a day. - You consider this a good day? - Yeah, I haven't laughed this long in a while. I'm exhausted. - Why don't you go to sleep? - Mm, no, not yet. I like right now. Tell me a story. - A story? You know all my stories. - It doesn't have to be about you. - You know all my stupid stories. - Okay, tell me a funny one. - A funny one? - A true one. - A true one, a funny true story? - Something I've never been told before. - All right. Okay, hold on. In 1989, Mexico City, (peaceful atmospheric music) was dealing with their biggest pollution and traffic problems ever, it was unbearable. So the government decided they had to do something about it. They had to come up with a solution to solve this traffic crisis. So, they came up with a plan that depended on the last digit of your license plate, okay? If it was odd, then you could drive on these days. If it was even, then you can drive on these days, right? They predicated that this would ease traffic, that it would solve the problem of exhaust, that it would cause cars to be exported out of the city, 'cause people wouldn't be drivin' as much. Seems like a pretty wise plan, doesn't it? - [Alex] Yeah. - So what do you think happened? - Did they enforce it? - Yeah, they did. - Then it worked? - Nope. - Why? - Because people, they just bought more cars, so that they could drive on the day that they couldn't drive before. Exacerbating the pollution problem, because they were just buying crappy old cars. In turn, it made Mexico City the biggest polluting city in North America. Sorry, that didn't make any sense, did it? - No, but it was funny. (chuckles) It was funny, thank you. - [Jaime] Look, you should really get some rest, okay? - Jaime. - [Jaime] What's goin' on? - I've always been so sure about every decision I ever made. Even if it became a mistake, I've just been sure. You know that. - I love that about you. - Choosing you was the most unsure, scariest moment of my life, and I only just now realized why. - And why is that? - It's because it wasn't my choice to begin with. It just happened without me knowing, so it felt different. Somewhere along the way, it could've been when I first met you, but it happened. And we laughed and screamed and we fought to protect it. (chuckles) The same butterflies I felt the first time I saw you, I still have today. I don't think we can take credit for the first ones, but, the way I felt when I heard your footsteps come in the door? We earned that. That was earned. Hey, Jaime. Just because I'm gone, doesn't mean it can't happen again. - No, I can't. - Hey. Life could always be worse. - Oh, yeah, how is that? - Driving in rush hour in Mexico City. (Jaime sobs) It's okay. It's okay. (Jaime sobs) Come up here. Come on. (peaceful atmospheric music) (food sizzles) - Good morning, Jaime. (Jaime speaks foreign language) Good morning, you want the usual, sweetie? - Yes. - Okay. - Now, what have we here? Three-letter word, a cool can. Ice. Perfect. How are you doing? - Oh, you know, the usual. Your bagel should be out in just a second. - Thank you. - Yeah. How's it goin'? - Good. - [Waitress] Good, what can I get for ya? - I'd like to have a peppermint herbal tea, please. - All right, you got it. - Thanks. - Are you stuck? - [Jaime] Yes. - Well, maybe I can help. - Six-letter word. Solanaceae. Fruit from Mexico, good for the heart. - Orange? - Orange I tried, it contradicts four-down. - [Waitress] Oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out. - I'm sure. - Nightshade. - Too long. - Nope. Solanaceae is a nightshade, it's a plant from Mexico and it spread through colonization. Debatably, it's a vegetable too, but there are over 10,000 varieties worldwide. - Tomato. - Tomato. - Tomato. - Tomato is a plant that was originally harvested by the Mayans. It has a lot of lycopene in it which is good for the heart.
