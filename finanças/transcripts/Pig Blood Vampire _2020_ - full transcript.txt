It's not my pig then, I just lost it. Looks like the same pig. What do you mean, looks like? Can't you tell us pigs apart? I know you, you're the guy in the pig mask. Everyone else, who knows. Hello. I'm the production assistant for the play. You're late for rehearsal. Have you ever met a pig? Met a pig? Yeah. Uh, I don't think so. I have at like a zoo. Oh yeah? Yeah. Pigs in a zoo? Yeah. You've never seen a pig at a zoo? No. Have you ever met a pig before? Oh yeah, lots of em. I love pigs. At the beginning of our play our hero has just awoken. He's had his breakfast cereal, stumbled out of bed and onto the stage. Eh, yuck. That's a nice touch. I wouldn't touch it. Good idea. Should we talk about rehearsal? Uh. Hello. Hello my dear. May I request your presence this evening? See, this is rehearsal. Hello. I'm Dr. Peter Langenfeld. I'm a psychiatrist. I've been sent here to – Yeah, why are you here? I'd like to ask you a few questions. Oh yeah? What? This may take some time. Everything takes time, man. What is it? It's a series of questions to establish your tendency towards certain predilections, predispositions and disorders. I don't think you're in the right place. Oh, I can assure you I am, Sir. May I come in? No. I'd like you to stay very relaxed. I'm going to begin by asking you a series of – How'd you get in here? Questions. Let me begin by asking, have you been having any visions lately? Huh? Have you been seeing anything that isn't really there? The world is full of illusions, man. Who knows. Have you had any recent trauma to the cranial region? Not that I remember. Tell me, have you ever heard of prosopagnosia? It's an apperceptive, associative or developmental condition more commonly known as face blindness. Could it be that you were born this way? No, I've changed a lot. Can you tell the difference between these two objects? Okay, be seeing you. At the beginning of our play our hero has just awoken. He's had his breakfast cereal, stumbled out of bed and onto the stage. Just a minute, folks. Did you see where he went? Who, my dear? Hey, Mike! Nope, haven't seen him. Where did he go? I don't know. Get Victoria ready. We'll go right into her monologue. Yes, sir. Will do. Victoria! One minute. Ladies and gentlemen. There are times in the life of a story when changes occur. The unexpected happens. Hurry it up. And changes must be made. Yeah, let's go. Excuse me? This play sucks.

Beauty dies in the street, lives in the night and –- We are like stars, not far but out of reach. How far we are. Na na, la da da da. Waiting for love. Na na na na. This might be the night. The blood red dream. Impossible. Hi. Oh, hey. I tried to call you but you didn't pick up. Are you okay? Oh yeah, I'm fine. You're not taking the news too hard? What news? The play. The play is dead. Have you not heard? Huh. I'm sorry. I just came by to say I really hope we get the chance to work together again. Yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Ah! Help, police! Hey, come on. Play nice. I'm going home. It's okay. What have you been doing? This pig is petrified. I'm sorry. I keep coming by hoping you'll come around. You really are a vampire, aren't you? No, I'm a vegetarian. I'm taking the pig. Let's go. Hello. I'm officer Gunderson, but you can call me Old Bob. Are you for real? I'm as real as the sun is shining. A police officer? I like to consider myself an ambassador of goodwill. So what's all this pig stuff? There's been a lot of pig stuff lately. Some kind of funny business? It all started with bacon. You can't fault a man for his bacon. And then there were a few different pig masks, and an actual pig. Now I can't find the pig again. Some guys keep showing up and chasing me around. Was anybody hurt? No. Do you know who they are? I don't know who anyone is. Hm. I don't know about all that. So what do you do with yourself? What do you mean? Do you work? Or do you just wander around frightening the locals? I'm an actor. Well, that explains it. So what have you done? You been in a movie? Unopposed! Unopposed! Unopposed. Unopposed! Unopposed. Unopposed! Unopposed! Unopposed! Unopposed! Unopposed! Unopposed. Unopposed!

Have you thought about politics? Name? What? What is your name? You know what my name is. Date of birth? Hello. Okay. What is it? What do I have to do? Mr. Cummings, could you please reiterate your stance on government intervention? Look, all I'm saying is, it's simple. I'm for the government staying out of your lives. And what would you say your stance is on the government staying out of people's lives, as it were. What do you got to say? Say something. You think you're so smart. You think you're better than me. Ya ba da ba da da. Da ba da da. You gonna listen to this guy that doesn't have anything to say? Don't you want a leader? Don't you want a leader that can show you the way? To a promise new day. It's the new order. It's the new way of doing things. I promise you, follow me. I'll take you down the right path. I'll show you prosperity. He can't do that. I mean he doesn't, he doesn't even have anything to say. You should listen to me. Not to him. Not to him. Oh. I see how it is. Well I'm out of here. It's good to see you let your pig run free. Remember me? No. Just in case you need it. What's the difference? I don't know. You think it's all the same? No. Yeah. I'm gonna do something about it. Good luck in congress. Hey. Hey. Im back. It's me again. Okay. So what now? I killed a pig. What?
