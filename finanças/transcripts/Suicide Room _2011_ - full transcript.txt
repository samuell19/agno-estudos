SUICIDE ROOM - Who'll ask first? - The woman in red. - What about? - I'll deal with it. You smell nice. - Good morning. - Minister... Ready? Let's go. How will your financial crisis commission work? Could you tell us about the targets and deadlines. Thank you. Well, The Minister has decided... Could Mr. Santorski answer himself, please? Andrzej Santorski, economy expert. Bonjour...! - Got it? - Yes. - Show me. - Now? And the clients? Oh, come on! They're late. Don't fucking toss it around! I busted my ass for our boss's son. Wow! Dominik will look divine! They can't reach you on your mobile. And you? What are you here for? Yeah, I can see you. Just go around the building. In the conference room. Bye! They're here. OK, so we recommend this one. He's black and we're making this for Eastern Europe! OK, so let's try the next one. - Sporty, handsome... - Give me that. Not good. Not good. Really bad. - Congratulations. - I'm sorry... In here, you've got to work, baby. I haven't been home for a long time and tonight won't be any different. With the financial crisis we've got to work our asses off. Got a bank credit? Everyone's got a bank credit. - Understood? - Yes. Good morning. Hi. - You OK? - Yes. Could you turn it down a bit? What? Turn it down, please. Could you turn it down a bit more? And a bit more. And a bit more, just for me, please. Thank you. Santorski Dominik. Ready? What question have you drawn? ''The time is out of joint: cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!'' How do you understand Hamlet's words? Well - how? Hamlet looks for a way of conveying the truth, by unmasking falsehood and hypocrycy that surround him. So... ...he puts on... a mask. All... All deep notions are masked. Art often presents jesters or madmen who, by their actions, expose evil. What are you watching? Yuck! What's that? - Cool, isn't it? - Turn it off. - Where did you get it from? - Internet. OK I really need to go now. Wait, you've got to see my prom dress. - Very nice. - Isn't it? - What's up, my prince? - Hey! Give me a break! You see? Low cut on the back, and at the front... - Your tits will show. - No they won't! Here's a cut, so you can stick your leg out. I've awesome shoes... Dominik! - Hi. - Hi. - Why so sad? - Sad? I'm not sad. - Can we go now? - Yes. Do you know who you're taking to the prom? Am I taking someone to the prom? Maybe... - Do you know who? - Maybe. - Would you go with me? - Maybe. - Who will you take to the prom? - Karolina. She's fucking great. - What about you? - ...fucking hot. Well, I'll dance with Magda, but I'll go on my own. - We're here. - What are we doing here? We came to your mum's office to pick up your suit for the prom. Can't she take it home later? She called, she won't get home tonight, they have a photo shoot. Isn't there anyone else who can just bring it? No one's picking up the phone, they must be in a meeting. Why don't you just nip upstairs yourself? Why don't you, if you have to work here, stop calling me like we're pals, miss? ''Why don't you go upstairs yourself, Sir?'' Thank you. Dominik, I can't talk now. I use silk with its beautiful texture... closed world, wounds open open world, wounds closed Hello, Hello? You scared us, buddy! Give me the radio. We've found him. Dominik, goddamnit! Haven't you got a mobile? Like Polonius from ''Hamlet'' ''reality is what is left once everything else ends''. Final exams in 100 days! The name of the exam, ''matura'', comes from Latin for ''mature''. I wish you courage: to be brave, courage to express yourselves. I also wish you find your calling. There's nothing better in life than having passion and love! That's when you're truly happy. Hi, hi...! - You're also late? - Crisis. Wait for me. - What a beautiful dress! - You like it? Thank you. - Did your mum choose it? - She helped me. - Amazing! - Thank you. And you? Smile, my boy! It's a nice day! Good evening! Congratulations. Your son is a wonderful boy. Is he now? He's just to take his finals, then go to university, and whoosh! - And where will your son study? - My son... he... ...has already graduated. He's got a PhD and two kids. Andrzej, this is the headmaster. Lucky you! You didn't even know who you were paying... It was me. All those years... Nice to meet you. Santorski. Better late than never. Excuse me... Right, so, Sir, I'll show my parents out. - They were about to leave... - I'll wait at the table, Dominik. - Thank you both for coming. - I like it in here, very much. Oh come on, it's your day, Dominik. You look wonderful, I'm so proud. See you. - He just threw us out. - Andrzej? - Shush...! - What? Quiet! Quiet! Someone's in the garden. Stop it! Put the gun away! Have you locked the gate? - Have you? - No. - See? - Stop it! Someone's in the garden. Nadia, what are you doing here? My wife and I are having a serious conversation! - I have a gun, I could've shot you! - I'm sorry... At this party, there were only girls, and I was so fucking horny! And you weren't there! So there was this chick and then she said she was a lesbian so we got it on, like all the way: sticks, fingers, vibrators! I must say now that no guy gives head like Dominika. Dominika? She's a lesbian? No shit! Magda, don't tell me you've never kissed a girl. - Of course I did! - No shit! I fucking don't believe it! Prove it! With Karolina! Yeah! Both do it! - Hey! Stop it! Stop, quiet! - Quiet! Oops, something's spilled... I've got an idea: I'll make out with Magda, if you make out with Dominik. - Yeah! All right! Let's do it! - Deal? We have a deal? Come here pussycat... - Hot! - Go on, go on! Go on! Go on! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Fuck, I keep my word! Deal is a deal! We gotta do it now! I'm filming it, go on! I need a beer. - Want a sip? - Bottoms up! 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...! Wow! He's so into it! Homos! Homos! Alex and Dominik, do I hear wedding bells? The kissing was sweet. When I watch you guys kissing I feel sooo hot! And I got a girl boner! This is the event of the year! Dominik, Aleks, together! Fucking hell! - Hello, can you pick me up? - But you only finish in an hour... But I've finished now, pick me up now. Where are you? But I'm like on the other side of town. - Where are you? - I can be there in an hour... But I've finished now, understand? When will you come? In 10 minutes? We have a schedule, a plan for the day. I know the plan, fuck the plan! I know this fucking plan by heart! You are to be here, waiting for me! You're to wait for me, you're to be here for me! Fuck! You're to watch over me, stay with me all the time! Fine, have it your way, I'm going home alone! ALONE! You goin' with us, miss? Turn it off. I told you to turn it off. Turn it off. - Why? - Turn it off. - Why? - 'cause I hate techno music? - So? Go back to your seat. - I'm not talking to you. I don't know who you're talking to, but I am talking to you. Go back to your seat. - Turn it off, understand? - What's your problem? - Turn it off. - Hell no! Turn it off! Good evening. How is he? Just scrapes and bruises. Nothing serious. Just a fight. Nothing serious? They almost killed him! I left the prescriptions for him. Call if you need me. - Thank you! - Unbelievable. He took the bus home, because the driver didn't turn up! The driver will lose his license. You'll be taking cabs. Outrageous! You hire someone to drive your child and the boy goes on a bus! We'll take them to court, sue them and see what happens. - I'm calling the lawyer. - Have him come in the morning. I can't do it in the morning. I've got to pick my clients up from the airport. - I've a meeting at the Ministry. - I take them out for dinner. - I have to get that job, you know? - Everyone has something to do. This one looks like Italy. The lawyer should be here now. What is it with you? Why do you need the lawyer now? - Taxi is here, madam. - I know, I'm coming! - Maybe something to eat, Sir...? - No, thanks. Actually... coffee please. Oh my God, this judo will make history!! - What the fuuuck?!!! - No fuckin' way this shit happened! - Alex, are you gonna have kids? - unFUCKlNGbelievable! - Alex, did the sperm come off? - Spermwrestling! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Fucking spermshooter! I'm bleeding, quietly living I'm living, quietly bleeding come to me how? dominik: WHERE ARE YOU? Suicide Room: PlNK HAlR dominik: HEY dominik: IS THAT YOU? dominik: HELLO dominik: ? dominik: I THOUGHT WE WOULD TALK dominik: INSTEAD OF DANClNG IN SOME GAME Hello? Hello? Anybody there? I can hear you breathe. I'm showing my face. Now you show me yours. Suicide Room... You're wearing a mask? You're ill or something? Why the mask? It protects me. From harmful people and substances. Do you need help? Maybe you'd like me to call someone? - Get someone to see you? - Look, look! Take a good look! See? Try fucking calling anybody! I'll fucking top myself, I will! Razors are my friends. They have very sharp tongues. - Is that what you want? - Calm down. Why do you want to kill yourself? - Why don't you want to kill yourself? - To live. And I want to kill myself to die. I need to pluck up the courage and I'll do it. - What's your name? - Sylwia. Ah... Sylwia. Sylwia. - Hi Dominik. - Hi Sylwia. You know... This is my room. You like it? I do. And this is my room. You like it? OK. What happened... to your eye? I had an accident. Out of my own stupidity. Well, well. An accident of my own stupidity was what I had today. Got any Kleenex? - I've got a team of runners. - Where? See them running? You were doing just fine until now... Don't you know the components of the air you breathe? This air is killing you, I can see that. You won't fool me. You're fooling yourself. Why are you doing it? How do you mean 'fooling', I'm not trying to... Hello? Now go... Walk forward and kill him. - ''Walk forward and kill him?'' - Shoot, shoot! Wait, there's a shadow... - Hi guys. - Hi mum. I got to go... - You're not at school? - I'm not feeling well. Andrzej, why are you letting him do that? He's got his finals soon, it's so irresponsible. Take care, Dominik. - What about me? - You take care, too. Mrs Beata? Destination: Suicide Room. - What are you looking for in here? - Sylwia. There is no such person here. You must've gotten the wrong place. - This world is closed. - But I am sure she must be there. - There is no such person here. - Why don't I believe you? - You won't come in. - Meaning she's here. - Can I talk to her? - She's not here. And you won't come in, don't you get it? Who's he? I'm looking for Sylwia. - You brought him here? - Do not insult me! Who's that? He's looking me in the eyes. - Who is this man? - Answer! The queen is asking. I'm Dominik. I'm new here. ''You're new here''? What do you mean 'new'? - What do you want? - I'm not talking to you. I want to talk to the queen alone. Unless she's scared. Shut up! Respect! What do you want? - I want a chance. - What for? For a fight. Ooh, I like the sound of it! - Fighting for what? - For myself. - Whom do you want to fight? - You. Choose your weapon and place. Begin! You'll regret you're here, whore. You think this is a game, motherfucker? This is more than a game. This is Suicide Room, we've been creating it for a long time... Hah, I can see you! Moving nervously, eh? You've hidden in a sewer like a rat. You like Sylwia, don't you? She wants just one thing, and you won't give it to her. Hah, you panic!! I can hear you down there... Are you afraid? Fuck!! Fuckin' motherfucker! Wait a minute! Is he going to get in? Just like that? - You agreed to a duel. - You want to spite me, right? Mind your tone, Jasper. You're breaking the rules. Stop it! Look, can't you see what she's doing? You're forbidden from coming into the Suicide Room. Me? But it's OUR room! No! Don't throw me out! Let me back in! Welcome to the Suicide Room, Dominik. ...so we're there, by the London Opera. We can't find our tickets. No fucking way! It's raining cats and dogs, we've no umbrella. My Kitty gets an idea: Iet's go dancing in Negro part of town. It wasn't a Negro district, but Soho! Anyway, listen: we're walking back home at dawn, drunk as skunks, we're singing, dancing, I'd lost my handbag, he'd lost his wallet. Passports, everything: gone. We get to the door, I'm looking for a key... That's gone as well. What a drama! But there's something in my pocket: I reach deeper, - and find fucking what? - Tickets to the opera! Oh! - Maybe we could go together? - What's on now? - Orpheus and Eurydice. - Great! Great idea! I love it! Gluck... Let's go! One of the opera's great reformers... That's it, then: we're going! Minister's orders! Oh fuck! You alive? - Holy fuck! - Yup, fine, fine. Ok, thank you everyone. My queen, shall we go on with the next film? Dominik? Oh no! Get dressed, will you? We're about to go now! Mum, mum, please, couldn't we... Oh, please! Don't argue. Get ready, son, get a move on! I have to go, Sylwia. You ''have to''? Yup... Look: the ocean. - You like it? - Beautiful. It doesn't have to do anything. It can do whatever it wants. Gluck is no Rossini or Verdi, you understand? Youth - the future of the nation! - Did you enjoy it? - Second act - superb. Going out with parents must be a bit... Yeah, why don't the two of you go out together? Weronika could invite you to see her ballet performance. The only problem is I don't quite like girls, I'm gay. - Oh, you're silly, you are! - I prefer boys. He almost got me fooled! I'd love to take Weronika out, but... Dominik? Dominik... - Very funny! - Very funny. What were you trying to do? What is it, some sort of fashion to be gay? - Will you wear makeup now? - Maybe. You're fucking spoilt! You've got everything! We gave you everything, you want for nothing! You're not gay! Maybe I am? You're fucking spoilt! You're not gay at all! Even if you are, keep it to yourself. You don't tell people things like that. But people should know... No, they shouldn't. Who cares? I don't want to know that, the Minister certainly doesn't have to know that. Especially him. I've been trying to get this job for years, and you're destroying it all. Just like that. - What is it? - A car behind us. We are in the street, aren't we? It's been following us since the opera. Andrzej! You're going to school tomorrow. - But I haven't got any classes... - ENOUGH! Hello? Hellooo? Hello. - What's up? - OK. Show me your lips. Fear. Are you afraid? You are afraid? You are. I see fear. Please, you're torturing me and I've got to go out. They're waiting for me. I must go to that school. Dominik! You don't have to do anything. You don't. Reality hurts you, because you're sensitive. Just like me. I'm sensitive, too. Very much so. They don't understand us. How weak they are! We're freaks, weirdoes, outside the norm. Dominik? You're different. Treasure that. Everything that's outside the norm, everything... ...is in danger. We cannot be afraid. Then what am I to do? Scare them! Be a terrorist. You're a terrorist. I went to school, I walked through the corridor. I went past my class, Iooking them all in the eyes. And I looked at that loser, and he just looked away. - Was he scared? - Yes. - Was he? - lt was incredible. I was in total control of the situation. I was... I was... I can't describe it! I felt like an animal. Like... a murderer! That's what you talked about, that's what you wanted! Yeah! Exactly that! - You were right. They are... - They know nothing. They know nothing. They play pathetic, ridiculous parts in an hollow, ridiculous play. - You're a hero. - Come on...! I want to hug you. Come. Maybe we could meet? Could we? We do meet. Yes, in here, but maybe we could simply meet somewhere. - I could pick you up. - Well... That would be a problem. I'd really like that. - No, no, not a chance. - But... I hate reality, right? I don't go out into the real world. - But you've got to go out. - What for? - To live. - I don't want to live. What do you mean, you don't go out? - I don't. - You don't leave your house at all? Dominik! Not at all. OK. So how long have you not come out? A week? Two weeks? Three? Three is a good number. Before they know what's going on, we'll gain enough time to get money from an international fund. That gives us 6 months. Consumption rises before Christmas, so we'll be OK for the year end. You haven't been out for three months? You're not there yet. Three...? - No, you're kidding me. - Three, three... Three - what? You want us to start again? I paid for it. Am I to teach them marketing and management? My creative people sent you designs, costumes, taglines, you've accepted it all, and I paid for it. - More? - Three... - You haven't been out... - ...for three years?! You haven't been out in three years? You're only... How is that possible? Nobody tried to get you out? You think they didn't? - I think they did. - And right you are. Why haven't you been out? How did you manage that? I don't want to. What can they do to me? Beat me? Kill me? If they do, that's even better. That's what I'm waiting for. I'm free. I recommend this feeling. Everything you need is inside you. You don't need school. You don't need parents, your loved ones. You don't need anyone. - How long has he been in there? - Ten days. Has he been eating in that time? I left it by the door, but he didn't want it... - Did you hear anything? - No. Please, get in there! Police! Open up! - You're not from here, are you? - No. From Ukraine. - You've got your passport? - No. - A work visa? - Nothing. - Mr Santorski is an actor, isn't he? - A politician. Just great... - Dominik! - Get her out of the way! Dominik! Can you hear me? Hello? - You're here to see...? - Don't touch me! - Doctor Lewandowski? - Yes. - Mr and Mrs Santorski? - Yes. Your son had an acting-out when the police came... - Wouldn't you? - What do you mean: 'acting-out'? He harmed himself. - He didn't want to talk to us. - And right he was. We've taken him in, legally, though without his consent. He'll stay here for observation for at least three days. You'll lock up my child for three days with psychos? I work for the Ministry, here's my ID. The police have entered our house illegally, called by that lady, who doesn't work for us anymore. We'd like our son transferred into a private clinic. - Sorry. That's out of the question. - Why? It was a suicide attempt. Suicide attempt? He is a normal, healthy boy! He's got to learn, he goes to school, he is a normal child. Suicide attempt? Is that your diagnosis? We'll sign all the papers and take our son home. What are you talking about? You haven't even been home. Of course we have! And you haven't noticed he'd missed ten days of school? Dominik hasn't left his room for ten days. Why wasn't I told any of this? Dominik, come here. Madame, he is legally an adult. He doesn't have to talk to you. - Have you gone fucking mad? - Pardon me? Have you gone mad? Well... Dominik? Would you like to talk to your parents? Dominik? We've replaced the door in your room. You simply have to tell us what you expect of us. We'll try very, very hard, but... We have to talk to one another. We don't talk at all. Look at me. He doesn't look at me when I talk to him. Ask him to look at me. What is it? Why aren't you looking at me? Oh, come on... Maybe we could go away for a few days? No, I can't. So what is keeping you here? I don't know, it's not the right time yet. I need time. I don't enjoy pain anymore! It doesn't purify me! I got used to pain! I pushed the boundaries out! We've got to move forward. It's a critical moment. We want to go through death in a painless and dignified way. I dream about taking a bottle of pills, drinking alcohol, and falling asleep. So when do we do it? You have all decided to kill yourselves, right? Wait, wait... You've got to get back to us. - You've got final exams. - I won't take any final exams. I've done what I thought was best for you. As best as I could. But now... I just don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. You've got to suffer. ...like you've never done before. Howl with pain. What a nice house. It was my great grandparents'. Everything around was my family's. You've got a big family. - Family is important to you. - Doctor... we wondered whether we should ask for psychiatrist's help... Dominik stopped leaving his room as you know. And recently he said he wouldn't take his final exams. That's when we realised we needed someone who... - ...will get him out of there. - We need help. Maybe therapy or medication? Wouldn't pills be the best? Have you got any dangerous objects in the house? - I've got a gun. - I've got a taser. If there was a suicide attempt, you have to get rid of all that. Guns, tasers, knives, scissors, bazookas, F-16s... We don't know if he really tried to kill himself. We can do it, but how long will the therapy take? We don't want him to lose a year. His exams are soon. I can't guarantee he'll leave his room in time for exams. You can't? But we were counting on that! Of course with your help we could... We want to help! What are we to do? I need basic info on him: his favourite music, films, does he read - and what? - He reads, yeah. - He reads a lot. Has he got friends? Girlfriend? Boyfriend? Well... He keeps everything to himself. Don't look. Wait, not yet. OK, now. It's beautiful. Dominik? Switch to the video, quick! We have a psychiatrist here, a very good one. Let me talk to him on my own. - No, we'll stay. - Just for a moment. Mr Dominik, your parents asked me to talk to you. This is my favourite love story. - They're asleep? - They'd fallen asleep. Forever. Pills and alcohol. I'd like that. - I just have got to get some pills. - It's not that easy. Not easy for me, but... it would be easy for you. - How? - Mr Psychiatrist. I know what to say so that he prescribes something. It's my dream, Dominik. What was that? You spied on me, you broke into my account! - What now? - What do you mean ''what''? I know all about you. - Traitor! - We don't want you! My dear, why don't you ever use a webcam? You don't want us to see what a fat, ugly cow you are! Shut up! What a huge avatar! And who's in front of his little computer? A cripple! A simple lame of a cripple. What fucking right have you got to say it all? Feel better now? ''The Queen''. My dear Dominik, she lead me astray, just like she leads you. She knelt down and moaned her love... You wish! You're succumbing to a fanatical creature! You're just a whore! Maybe: he thinks it's the end of the world. It is quite common with teens. He only THlNKS that, but it's not true. I don't know, be creative. ''People your age often think the world makes no sense''? That's it! Your parents wrote a letter to you. ''Our beloved son, talk to us. We realise we made mistakes. Give us a chance to talk things through. People your age often think the world makes no sense. You're becoming an adult and it is natural. You've got studies ahead of you, work, career, stress, but also success, self destruct... Self-fulfillment...'' Self-destruction! ''...making your dreams come true. It's all at your feet. You've only got to reach for it. Go get it!'' Go get it! ''lt is your life. Your parents'' He doesn't know how to function in the real world. Told you. He chose a place where he is not alone. Internet. It helps a lot. He is in touch with people who listen to him. Should we talk to him through Internet, too? - Very good idea. - It was a joke! That's his way of communicating. If you want to reach out to him... Don't you think we should take decisive steps? - He needs time now. - But he hasn't got time! But if you're willing to work with me... What good did that do? He tore our letter up! That is his answer. How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb? Only one. But it takes a lot of time and money, and the bulb really has got to really want to change. Without examining him, I can't prescribe anything. Give us a contact to a colleague of yours who can. None of my colleagues will do that. If you want your son to come out, you really should spend more time with him. Thank you, doctor. If only I could ask you for a phone number to one of your colleagues. Just in case. - What is it? - Your task. - You are to get the pills. - Then I am asking for another task. Sylwia? - Sylwia, I'm sorry. - Weak, weak, weak... Please, let's meet. I'm begging you, let's talk... The pills. - I can't... - The pills. - I beg you, forgive me, I can't. - The pills! I can't... Don't make me. - Talk to me. Meet me, please. - Good bye. - But why? - You're out of the Suicide Room. - Why? Why? - And of the last moments of my life. - Good bye. - Wait! Hello? Don't do that to me, please... - Good evening. - Boy, do you live far away or what! - Come in, please. - May I? I'll write the prescriptions for you. - Your son's name? - Dominik. Wouldn't you like to talk to him? OK then. Where is he? Leave me alone! I don't want anybody, leave me alone! Dominik? Leave me alone! Shut up! I don't have to be here. I've got things to do. Your parents paid me a lot of cash to talk to you. Just tell me how you feel. How do you feel about the world, about me? I feel bad! I FEEL BAD! I FEEL BAD! I'll prescribe you something, because you locked yourself up, and that's an illness. You've got three minutes to talk to me. Three minutes! So, may we? Come closer to the door. The pills you mentioned... Maybe they could help. I can prescribe you something, but I need to know what's bothering you. Are you hallucinating? Tell her you're not, she'll think you're schizophrenic! Do you hear sounds, or you think somebody's talking to you, but you can't see them? That's what it is with you, we're talking, but I can't see anybody. The anxiety I feel overwhelms me, I can't sleep. - Lack of sleep? - Yes. I have this fear... I only see the worst sides to everything. I want to get rid of that, I want a normal life. - I want to get out of here. - Make sure she gives you the pills! Prescribe me something, so I can get out of here. You wanted to... well, you did harm yourself. Yes, I remember. Did you really want to kill yourself? - Of course not! - See? - Dominik, you're not a suicidal type. - How do you know that? I have experience! You don't fool me. Actually, I don't understand people who kill themselves. One's got to have courage to live. They are cowards. Narcistic egoists, who think the whole world evolves around them. How can you give away the most precious gift you have? How can you do it to yourself and your loved ones? I don't understand that. I don't want to. You live to give to others as much as you can. As I suspected, he suffers from severe depression. I suggest these two medicines. And let's observe him. Wait a minute, I need to gather my thoughts. You'll be gone and we'll be left here... Excuse me. Hello, sweetie? Mummy can't talk now, darling. I'll be going home soon. Bye, sweetie. ...we will be left here with our son, and I'd like you to tell us what we, as his parents, can do. Listen... We don't know what could happen in that room. Dominik is an adult. He's over 18 and he can make his own choices. - But... How does that help us? - We're helping HlM. I'm a doctor, I can't change the law. You've got to understand me. Are we to leave him, so that he does what he wants? I can't change it. We've got to calm him down. Please tell me then: what would you do in my place? As a mother. I don't know. Come to my clinic, I can see I could help you, too. See that rectangle there, with a knob? It's a door. You'll go through it into the garden, and get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. Is this the prescription? Thank you. Why don't you apologise to the doctor? Don't be sad. - Don't be sad, do you hear me? - I don't want you to go. - I have to. - I know. I'm ready. I know, but I so want you to stay. I'm so confused. I just don't know... You're afraid to be alone. I'll go with you. You don't want to die. I know it. You have to live. To whom it may concern. We didn't want it to end like this. We wanted to live. This world is out of love. This world is dying. This world doesn't deserve us. That is why we have to go. Our story's been told. We will go but you will remain. You're killing yourselves bit by bit without even knowing. You are the Suicide Room. - You're not drinking? - No. He's still my husband and has to take care of me. You all right? I heard you have problems with Dominik. - With our Dominik? - Yes. He missed his final exams? Is that a secret? Hope not... Could we help you somehow? You take care of your pretty girl, so that nobody fucks her in here. - Would you come with me now? - Did you hear what I said? - And you calm down. - So you're ashamed of me now? The brat has locked himself up? Let's get him out of there, then. He makes us look like idiots, and we're letting him do it. Is he wanting for anything? Tell me. What could we give him? What? This will be your last task, Dominik. You're the messenger. You're holding a treasure, keep it safe. I'll be at the bar, find me. Noone can find out that we know each other. It's really important. I'll be there until midnight, you have to be there. If you're not there, you'll never see me again, ever. Never, you hear?! This needs to be fulfilled, tonight. And now what? Come closer. And closer. Closer... Hello? Hello, my love? What the...? - Open that door, or I'll kick it in. - What is it? We don't deserve it! Do you hear me? We don't deserve it! You got everything you could wish for! What else do you want from us? - Dad, plug the net back in! - No way, son. Dad, please, please! Wires are out, that's it. - It's sick, my boy. - Plug the net back in! No more Internet, do you hear me! - You're addicted to it. - Plug it back in! NO! Mum! Mummy, I'll be good, just plug the net back in... - I'll go mad in here! - He's lying. - Get away from the door. - No. Plug the net back, you motherfucker! I'll show you motherfucker! Should have thrashed you with that cable! - Mummy! - You'd grow to be a man...! I'll kill you two, cunts! What are you...? Leave that thing alone! Leave it! Stoooop! You get points for this? How does it work? You just live there. You talk to people, spend time with them. You're there for them, they're there for you. What sort of people are they? Do they have a name? We're called... The Suicide Room. - Great... - But it's not what you think. They really helped me. They accepted me like a family, they must be worrying now. These people are like a family? But they won't know what's happened, because there is no Internet. I know but it would be good if I could let them know. No. There is no Internet and there will not be. What can I get you? Did you see a girl with pink hair in here? I'd like a beer. Bonjour. Give me your mobile, I'll record you. Start kissing! Kiss her! I'll record you now. Go on! Dominik! Dominik! Go on, go on! You're fucking spoilt, my boy! You're fucking spoilt! You certainly are not gay! You are a nobody, in fact. Plug the Internet back, please... Don't do it to me! Has he ever disappeared for so long before? - No, never. - Just great! So what now? I suggest we give it time, call the whole thing off for now. - Who's going to announce it? - Sylwia... - ...former suicide victims... - ...sounds cool... Hey, our queen! Sylwia, come over! My name is Beata Santorska. I'm Dominik's mother. I thought for a long time about coming here, and I decided I should do it. I wanted to thank you for being with my son. For supporting him. Dominik... is dead. He took his own life some time ago. I do realize it might be a shock for you. But I thought you ought to know. Call my parents! Call my parents! Mum!
