Thank you very much. Well, as you can see, I arrived by taxi, and that's how it all started. The Adventures of a Taxi Driver. It was one of the most phenomenal pictures of the 1 970s. There was a big box-office bonanza of British comedies. There was the Confessions series, and, of course, the Adventures series. They were funny, naughty, wicked, slightly bawdy, and they had queues at the box office all over this country. They were beating the Americans at their own game. Marvellous comedies. But how can we explain them? Why were they so popular? What was the secret ingredient of the Adventures films? Well, let's have a look at some of the items from the Adventures movies, and maybe we'll find out. Aficionado. Mirar por el ojo de la cerradura es de aficionados. Yo no lo hice, sehor Blake. Es que se me ha caído algo al suelo. Hmm. La inteligencia es un camino profesional. -Carol! -Ciao, amore! Carol, la mia ragazza. Ha il matrimonio sempre fisso nella testa. Ah, cosa ci fai con quella? Si, le sta andando, Carol. Cosi per scaricarsi di tutta le responsabilità. C'est pas vous qui étiez au pieu avec Monty? Bon Dieu de bon Dieu, le bougre. Bon sang! Par inadvertance, y'avait bien besoin d'un coup de main! Tu peux y aller. Yo sé que les gustan las mujeres mayores. Lo leído los periodicos. Tenemos una residencia en Esher. Syd la construyó. Su profesión esse es. ¿ Se recuerdas del bloque de pisos que se ido el aho pasado? Era obra suya. Tonelada de cemento calles sobre el pueblo. Olvidé poner las vigas y claro todo se derrumbó. Well, you may not know the language there, but, of course, comedy is universal. And, by the way, the Adventures series sold to fifty-seven different countries. So, shows you how popular they were. Right from the days of Chaucer, through the Decameron and those bawdy Restoration stage comedies, right up to the present time, humour, of course, has been right earthy, right down to earth. Take the case of a chap who fancies this girl, and the girl fancies the fella back, and they... they make a little, er... you know, an assignation, and they're gonna have a bit of hanky-panky. Well, what happens is what has happened to all of us. Right in the middle of everything, they get caught in the act. Where's Joe? I came to see him. Oh. Er... He's not in. He's out. No. His taxi's here. It's all right. He is expecting me. Hello. I'm Carol. Carol Hotchkiss. Joe's fiancée. I expect he's spoken of me. Which is his room? That one? Thank you, dear. Carol ! Listen, I can explain. I don't want you to think I'm promiscuous, just because you caught me at a weak moment. Oh, I don't. I don't. Look, just lift up a bit, will ya? It's just that without Ronald, I feel so helpless. Oh, I don't know, you seem to be doing all right. I wish he was here right now, so he could see. Oh, I don't! Linda! -It's Ronald. -Ronald? -Oh! -You got it all wrong, mate. It's not like that at all. Get it out! Get it out! Get it out! Mum ! Mummy! What are you doing? Mummy's just having a little chat with the plumber. Why are you lying down? Don't ask silly questions. Do as I told you and go to bed. I'll go. -Where did he come from? -Upstairs. My God. Quick! Hello, Willy. Is your mummy in? Yes. She's with the plumber. Oh, Mrs Grimpton. What a lovely surprise. I do hope I'm not interrupting anything. Oh, no. Why were you jumping up and down on top of Mummy? Willy, dear, it's way past your bedtime. Daddy! Hello, hello, little man. Want to come up? There, what a big Willy I've got. Hello, hello, hello. What's going on here, then? Darling, you're home early. I just popped in to tell you I'm working late tonight. That missing person business at the hotel. Turned out nasty, I'm afraid. Afternoon, Mrs Grimpton. How's the Reverend? Bearing up, as usual. Daddy, why don't plumbers wear any trousers? Darling, um... that's the plumber. He's just come to unblock the sink. Plumber? -Local, are you? -Er... Why has he put his trousers back on, Daddy? Does that mean he's not going to jump up and down any more? Excuse me, mate. This where the blockage is? Crikey. Is that the time? Well, I'll just have to be running along because I've got a few more appointments to... to... Well, they were definitely caught in the act! And so were our next couple. Surprise, surprise. Lisa, it's me, your little Legs. Lisa? Hey, Lisa, open the door. Lisa? Legs! Fancy you coming round. -Who is in the shower? -Oh, no-one. I don't believe you. There's somebody in the shower. You're crazy. I was running that shower for myself. How come the door, she is locked from the inside, huh? You know what these doors are like, they're always sticking. See? Oh, Legs! Legs! Legs, my darling! -Oh, Legs. -Lisa. I got some flowers for you, huh. These are men's clothes. What are they doing here, huh? -Ah... Costumes! -Costumes? Yeah, for a new number I've been rehearsing. ♪ Follow the yellow brick road, ha-ha ♪ Costumes, huh? You've got somebody in here. A man, yes? Where is he, huh? You know, you can really be a jerk sometimes. You're so jealous! Mamma mia, I kill him, I kill him. Where is he, huh? Legs... Legs, don't be... Legs! Legs, listen. -Legs, there is nobody here. Really. -Hiding in the wardrobe, huh? Really, Legs. -He must be here. - No. There isn't, Legs. -There is no-one here. -Under the bed, huh? -Legs. -Under the bed. -No, nobody under the bed. -If I get him, I kill him. Under the bed, huh? -Or behind the curtains. -Jesus Christ. A-ha! Behind the curtains, huh? You're laughing at your little Legs, huh? You think I'm stupid, huh? Well, I tell you. Nobody laughs at Legs Luigi. U m... Legs, um... Why don't we just have a drink, huh? Right. Then I rip your knickers off, huh? Terrific. I'll hang up the coat and you get the drinks, huh? You say no. No, I tell you. You get the drinks, I put the jacket away. What do you think I am? Stupid? Nobody makes a fool of Legs Luigi, huh? Nobody. Ooh, it feels all lovely. All tingly. What a way to go! Marion? Marion! Marion, where are you? -Hide! -Marion, you in the bath? Ah, there you are. Didn't you hear me shouting? Oh, darling, what a lovely surprise. I wasn't expecting you. What a complete shambles. The whole trip. Oh, you poor love. Why don't you go downstairs, put your feet up, and pour yourself out a nice long drink, and I'll join you, and you can tell me all about it. Well, there's nothing to tell. The entire fiasco was predictable from start to finish, and you know who's responsible, don't you? -Well, I told 'em, I warned 'em. -Yes, you did. "You put Peters in as Acting Managing Director, "and you've got nothing but trouble on your hands," I said. "He can't cope with responsibility, "he's got no initiative, "runs a Ford Anglia and doesn't play golf. "You mark my words." Well, I've been proved right yet again. Oh, that's wonderful. Now, why don't you just go downstairs... HAROLD: "Wonderful?" It's frustrating. Well, it's... it's insulting. Oh, I quite agree. Now, why don't you just let me finish my bath, and I'll be straight with you? Yes, I... I could do with a drink. -What was that? -Nothing. Just knocked the plug, that's all. Oh. Oh, darling, um... can I get you anything? -What? -To drink. -No, just go downstairs and I'll be... -Marion, is it really necessary to use all that much bubble bath? You only bought this last week and you've already finished it. You really must be more careful in future. I can't afford extravagance of this sort. I mean, how you expect me to raise your housekeeping allowance in the face of such flagrant wastage, I really don't know. Really must pull yourself together, you know. You're getting very careless lately. Won't do, you know. No, won't do. It's all right. Marion, I meant to ask you, what on earth have you been doing in the bedroom? There's paint all over the place. It's a terrible mess. It's the decorators. It was meant to be a surprise. Surprise? I should think the only surprise I'd get would be the bill. Don't suppose you've thought to get an estimate first? -Oh, Harold... -Never mind. Don't upset yourself. I mean... No, I expect you... You meant well, yes, like Peters. He meant well, I expect, incompetent clodhopper. But the Board, listen? Would they listen? Please, Harold, the water's getting cold. Oh. Ah. Yes. Well, er... Yes, well, you have your bath and, um... don't you worry about a thing. No, it was a... a lovely surprise to find paint all over the bedroom. Yes, I think I do need a drink. It's all right now. It's all right now. Come on, quick! I brought you a drink, darling. I thought you might like one. Oh, you mustn't stand about like that, not with the window open. Oh, no, no. Catch your death. Sorry, mate, I'm not, um... St Mary's Convent, Upton Road. Yeah, but... Of all the rotten luck. Anyone else but a nun. I couldn't very well tell her to eff off, now, could I? I wonder if I could trouble you to help me with my cases? Oh, I thought I heard you come in. It's costin' me a bloody fortune in jeans, this job. -How come? -I keep losin' 'em. The Adventures comedy series had a lot of marvellous actors, of course. It was well produced and directed, and very well scripted, but the actors really made it. Now, perhaps you remember the Ealing comedies of a few years ago. They had marvellous, kind of strange, bizarre characters, played by Alastair Sim and Dennis Price, Alec Guinness, Joyce Grenfell, Margaret Rutherford. Do you remember all them? Well, you know, the Adventures series had their own kind of stock company of marvellously talented and equally bizarre people. There was the marvellous Anna Quayle, Liz Fraser, she was a refugee from the Carry On comedies, and there was, of course, marvellous Diana Dors, larger than life. Who can say more than Diana Dors? Perky Adrienne Posta, and, of course, Harry H Corbett. Craddock, this is Mr Blake. Would you take his things to the west wing, please? Certainly, madam. Your coat, sir. -Pardon? -Your coat, sir. Oh. Thank you. -Medea Dotrice, Judd Blake. -Oh, how... I see the mark of death on you. Judd's just staying for a few days. Yes, I can sense he won't be with us for very long. I have the second sight. Would you like some breakfast? Breakfast? I expect you'll be hungry after your journey. Oh, yes. Thanks very much. -Not there! -Over here. This is Violet, Medea's sister. Pleased to meet you. Oh, nothing passes between my lips unless it's organic. Violet's a vegetarian. I notice you didn't introduce your friend to me, Laura. Vi's my stepmother. I'm Clarissa. Hello. Pig's flesh! And the embryo of an unborn chicken. -I beg your pardon? -On your plate. It's not good for you, you know. Oh... The tea leaves. I see nothing ahead but misery, torment, and blood. Morning! Morning! Morning! Oh, God. Ah, breakfast. The morning is bright, so don't look so glum, 'cause, if you do, I shall smack your bum. Must you be so crude first thing in the morning? You've no sense of humour, Vi. I've told you that before. Sense of humour? Here? Knowing that... -Oh! Let me introduce you. Judd Blake, Sydney Burke. Ah, yes. Yes... Would you like some vitamin and iron tablets? They're very good for you, you know. Um... No, thanks. I've weak blood, you see. For God's sake, Vi, I'm trying to drink me breakfast. Blood ! Now, see what you've done. You've set her off now. Oh, Syd, don't say anything to upset me. You know how my nerves are. I can't take it anymore. You, er... You all live here, do you? Here? Live here? -Knowing that... - Oh. No, we, er... We have a house in Esher. Sydney built it. He's a building contractor. Do you remember that block of flats that fell down last year? They were his. Rows and rows of concrete, all around the town. I forgot to put the girders in, they all fell down! What business you in, then? -Er... Ornithology. -He's an 'orny-what? Bird watching. -Tits! -Oh! You get to see a lot of those, I suppose! Well, they're birds, aren't they? They call it "the bird from hell". -What? -Oh, it's just a superstition. Legend has it that all who are unfaithful to the owners of Grimsdyke Manor shall die screaming in the claws of a monstrous demon. She means that bloody great stuffed thing hanging up in the hall. Sometimes at night, its ghostly voice can be heard across the moors, screaming out for blood ! I did enjoy our little chat outside. It was really interesting. Fascinating. That's how you get to know people, isn't it? By chatting. Have you, er... -Have you got a towel? -Pink or blue? -Well, I'm easy. -I thought you might be. You've got that look about you. I knew you'd be just game for anything the moment I saw you out there. No, no. I didn't mean that... Does it do things for you? I see all the sex films, you know. Hot Lust and Sweaty Thighs. Nuns in Rubber. Now look, I mean, I didn't... I just... I thought that... Well, ordinary sex gets so boring, doesn't it? Especially with Frederick. He's my husband. He's got no imagination. Not like the milkman. You'd be amazed what he gets up to with his extra Pinta. Oh, come on, Mum, I'm late as it is. Well, it's your own fault. Comin' in here last night, pissed as a newt, crashin' about all over the place and wakin' me up. Lay off, Ma, will ya? Do us a favour. You're gettin' more like your father every day, you are. And you're gonna end up like him, mark my words. And where were you last night? Out screwin' some poor, innocent little girl, I suppose. -Just like your father. -Don't make me laugh. You hardly knew him. You only met him once. Don't talk like that in front of the baby. You woke her up and all, didn't he, my dear little pet? Have more consideration. Anyway, it was twice I met him. Twice. Gimme 'em ! Mummy'll give you somethin' nicer than that to play with, there's a good little girl. Well, are you gonna sit staring at that all day, or are you gonna eat it? I don't feel like eating. Look, just give me a cup of tea, will ya? Oh, I don't know why I bother, I really don't. I mean, food is wasted just as though it cost nothing. All right, all right! Something's burning. Porridge, by the smell. Oh, it's all right, just at the bottom. The top's all right. -Don't like porridge! -Yes, you do. It's lovely. -It's horrid ! Horrid ! Horrid ! -Shut up! -Oh! Now look what you've done. You know it makes her cry. All right, I give up. That's it. Bloody hell. I'm late as it is. -Look, where's me fares book? -Oh, in the cupboard. Oh, my God ! That little tyke's been thievin' again, ain't he? Where is he? Peter! Come in here! Peter! And he's like his father and all. Wind up in the same cell with him, I shouldn't wonder, the way he's carryin' on. Peter! How am I supposed to get to sleep with all this racket? Yeah? So? Where's the fire, then? Over here. Come here. Look, what have you got to say about all this lot, then? Good gear, innit? I mean, it's not rubbish, is it? Here, you said you got a proper job. Well, I have. I mean, I'm doin' it proper now, aren't I? Been working very hard at it and all. I've got a sharp little organisation together. You're gonna get us all into trouble one of these days. I mean, anyone could just walk in. Yeah, and all that lot lyin' there. Not to mention twenty cartons of hairspray I found hidden under me bed. Fell off the back of a lorry, didn't they, Mum? You're gonna end up in the nick with ten years ahead of you. Peter's goin' in the nick! Peter's goin' in the nick! Why can't you get an honest job for once? What? Like driving a cab? Leave off. Anyway, that's no more than bleedin' highway robbery, so what are you doin' tellin' me to go straight? Oh, choice. I like that. Hello. That'll be the new secretary, I bet. Oh, I can just see her now. Soft blonde hair, lovely, slender little body, deep sensitive eyes. Gubbidge. Maud Gubbidge. I'm the new secretary from Rent-A-Temp. Rent-a-what? But there must be a mistake. I mean... This is the Blake Detective Agency, isn't it? I was told to report to a Mr West. Is that you? Well, yeah, but I was expecting somebody a bit... -Older? -Well... Now, the last boss I had, he kept making improper suggestions to me. I hope you're not going to be like that. -Like what? -Keep making improper suggestions. Oh, no... way. Good. As long as the only thing I have to take down is shorthand, I don't mind. You see, er... it was my body that was the trouble. Yeah, I can see that. -He couldn't keep his hands off it. -Really. It got so bad, it was just unbearable, so I had to hand in my notice. He said I aroused his primeval impulse. -Mind you... I seem to have that effect on men, you know. Well, if, er... If you wouldn't mind answering the door, please, Miss, er... Gubbidge. Maud Gubbidge. -Yes, what do you want? -Blake Detective Agency? -That'll be all right, Miss Garbage. -Gubbidge. Yes, yes. If you'd like to step this way. Mr Judd Blake? Well... Joe North! You come here. Come here. Do I comprehend the situation correctly? -Are you leavin' home? -Dead right. Without a word to me or even a by-your-leave? It's got nothing to do with you. What do you mean it's got nothing to do with me? I happen to be your fiancée, and fiancées have a right to know these things. -So where are you going? -I don't know. -What do you mean, you don't know? -Well, I just told you, I don't know. You can't just leave home and not know where you're going. As soon as I find somewhere, I'll get in touch, all right? Well, when's that, then? How should I know? Tonight, tomorrow, as soon as I'm settled in. Well, does that mean you're not gonna take me out tonight? How can I? I don't know where I'll be. -Gone with the Wind. -What? That's what you were supposed to take me to, Gone with the Wind. Oh, come on, now. You must have seen it ten times. Eleven. What with that and Lady and the Tramp every year at Christmas, it's enough to drive anyone up the wall. Well, you don't have to come. I mean, nobody's forcing you to. I mean, you don't have to care if I'm on my own, probably being molested in the back row. Oh, come on. Who's gonna molest you? Lots of people, if I let 'em. Anyway, you always do. Yeah, well, I've gotta find something to do, haven't I? Gone with the Wind, it's a long film. Well, if you won't take me to the pictures, why can't I come with you and help you find somewhere to stay? Carol, I'll be all right. Supposing you're movin' in with another woman? Oh, leave off, Carol. Well, how am I supposed to know? Look, I'll ring you, all right? You see, if you would have told me you were leavin' home, I could have done the same, and then we could have moved in together, and... and got married before I originally planned. Yeah. Well, er... I'll ring you. See, if you wouldn't mind hangin' about for a bit, I could belt home and start packing straight away. Ah, no! Look, um... Twenty minutes, fifteen at the outside if you took me by cab. Carol, I haven't got time for all this. What is the matter? Do you not want to live with me anymore? 'Course I do. It's nothing to do with that. Well, you wouldn't think so, the way you go on about it. You know, you'll have to get used to it once we're married. Look, what's up with you? Don't you trust me or something? Quite frankly, no. Charmin'. Well, it's just that I don't like to think of you being unfaithful. Especially as I spent all my savings last week buying my engagement ring. -Have I ever been unfaithful to you? -No. Have you ever caught me with another woman? No. Have you ever caught me, when I've been out with you, even looking at another woman? -No. -Well, there you are, then. You've got nothing to worry about, have you? That is besides the point. Remember, a penny saved is a penny not spent. What are you goin' on about? Do not put all your balls in one basket. That is what I'm trying to say. You see, if I caught you reclining in the embrace of another woman, do you know what I would do? I would chop it off! Hello, Blackie. Ain't seen much of you lately, have we? -Well... -You know what I think? I think that you owe someone some money. Don't he, Stropper? Like about nine hundred nicker. Well, you don't think I've forgotten, do ya? Come on, you know me. I'm a man of me word. So's the guv'nor. He says some beautiful ones about you. Lovely ones. He even wrote them down for us. Says here, "Tell that lying git that if he don't cough up, "we'll break every bone in his horrible body "and stuff the bleeding lot down his throat." Like poetry, ain't it? Are you threatening me? BLAKE: Amateur. Peering through keyholes is for the amateur. I wasn't actually, Mr Blake. I just thought I'd dropped something on the floor. Mmm. Bugging. Now, that's the professional way. Bugging. Yes. And like everything else, purely a matter of technique. Now you stick with me, and you'll soon learn to be a successful bugger. Hello, Wilfred Crimble. Press. My card. -What? -My card. -Look, who let you in here? -Good murder, this, innit? -Fancy giving us an exclusive? -Certainly not. Now shove off. Not about how you're actually a private detective. How did you know that? I overheard your conversation with Inspector Hogg over there. What's going on here? Derek, deal with him, will you? I've got to go. Hello, Crimble, Press. You one of the murder suspects? -Well... -Care to say a few words, would you? -Slowly. -Look... How well did you know the dead body? -No... -"No..." -Comment. -"Comm..." Hey, who's that with Christopher Neil? I've seen him somewhere before. Well, back now to Barry Evans. Mrs Devere Barker? Parcel for you. Oh. Mmm. Bring it in, would you? Oh, if you'd just like to pop it down over there. I daren't touch it, you see. It's my nails. -It's your what, love? -Nails. Tropical Green, number three. Very exotic. The second they're dry, I'll be able to pay you, only I just daren't touch anything while they're like this. No, it's all right, you just stand there and dry off. -I'm in no hurry. -Oh. You wouldn't like a drink while you're waiting, would you? No, thanks, I'm driving. But thanks, all the same. Oh, not even a cold beer, something like that? Well, I wouldn't mind a beer, actually. Oh, do help yourself. Actually, darling, you couldn't do me a large Campari and soda, could you, while you're there? Yeah. -A large one? -Yes, please. -Say when. -I never do. Oh, be an angel, would you, and just slip it between my lips? Oh, the glass. Yes, of course. Mmm. Sorry to put you to all this inconvenience. Don't mention it. It's just I always seem to get caught out when someone arrives. Yesterday, it was the television repairman. The day before, it was the plumber, and, as for the window cleaner, well, every time he comes now, -I seem to be in the bath. -I see. Oh, you wouldn't be an angel, would you, and... undo it for me? Mmm. It's for a dinner tonight. My husband's in cement. Oh? Must be uncomfortable for him. It's a presentation dinner, you see, so I thought I'd wear green to go with my nail varnish. -Very nice. -Mmm. Seems to be all right now. You're not in a rush, are you? It's just I'd like to try it on to make sure it fits. -No, no, of course not. -Oh. Good. Some gaff this, innit? Must cost a packet. I bet she does, and all. Make yourself at home, won't you? I shan't be long. What about her, then? Bit of all right. "Shan't be long. My husband's in cement." Bloody hell. Have you lost something? Balls. Er... They fell off. Oh. Never mind. You couldn't give me a hand with the zip, could you? It seems to be stuck, and I don't want to break a nail on it. These birds and their zips. Jesus. It's a bit stiff. It won't be the only thing if she carries on like this. Yeah, I see what you mean. It is stuck, isn't it? Maybe if you pull it? That had crossed my mind. -Have you done it? -Yeah, I think so. Oh. Seems a bit loose. Oh. Look at that. Just look at it. That's just so typical of today's workmanship. That's the last dress I shall buy from there. Yeah, disgraceful. Now, what shall I do? Well, it was the only thing I could think of, wasn't it? What are you doing, standing there without a drink in your hand, huh? Sakes alive, there's enough liquor around here to sink a battleship. Lucinda, honey! There. No-one shall ever say Loretta Proudfoot lacks one iota of Southern hospitality. Even though she is 6,000 miles away from home. Oh, you're Mrs Proudfoot? Oh! I'm sorry, honey. I thought you were a guest. -Oh, no, I'm a plumber. -A plumber. Did I call for a plumber? Well, the Council sent me. Your water pressure's all over the place. Loretta, darling. You've been holding out on me. Where have you been hiding this one? This is Hubert, one of my dearest friends. -Hubert, meet, um... -Sid. Oh! What a lovely name. -He's a plumber. -A plumber! How interesting. Well, you can shove your plunger round my S-bend any day. I'll hit you over the bleedin' head with it. Ooh! Any time. He's so butch, dear. I'll see you later, heart-face. You must forgive Hubert. He's not afraid to say exactly how he feels. That's all right. It don't bother me. Good. 'Cause I believe in everybody being themselves. My late husband, who was a psychiatrist, always said the trouble with the world was sexual frustration. Very true. So, every now and again, I like to have a little get-together where all my friends can lose all their inhibitions. Oh, yeah. You mean, sort of, er... let it all hang out? Exactly. Oh, Robin, honey, this is Sid. My! Samantha's got a sparkle in her eye tonight, haven't you, honey? She's sparkling at everybody. I can't keep her away from the men. And you know what I'm like. I get so jealous. I was in two minds about coming tonight, but she insisted, didn't you, dear? Oh, she couldn't wait to lose her inhibitions. The moment she stepped into the room, she took all her clothes off. With a body like that, how can you blame her? Hasn't she got the most beautiful shape? -Fantastic, yeah. -Tell me, do you think I was right to bring her? -Yeah. -I know why you're saying that. You fancy her yourself, don't you? Now, now, Robin, Sid is not a man to step in between two people who love each other. You really must try to stop being so jealous, and I mustn't keep you from your duties for one moment longer. Enjoying yourself, honey? Fine. By the way, what actually is wrong with my water? Um... Well, it's not running properly. It's throwing the whole area out of balance. Get off me! Excuse me. Excuse me! -You've got my plunger. -Your what? Well, it's stuck to your ar... Well, I'll have to have it back. Do you mind? Well, I've got to get it back. Samantha! He's killed her. He's done her in. Part of the appeal of comedy, of course, is watching people having accidents. I know that sounds awful, but, as long as the accident didn't hurt anybody, and you're not in it, it's lovely to watch them. And in the Adventures series, they made the most of the accidents. Let's just look at some of them. Willie? Hello, Willie. Hello. Some people will do anything to get a day off work. You look like the Invisible Man. Yeah, I heard you was laid up, mate. I didn't think it was as bad as this. What happened? Got beaten up. Yeah, but who did it? I don't know. Blackie. No. Oh, not Blackie? His friend Stropper? Oh, yeah. N ice fella, Stropper. Oh! Sorry. I'm sorry, Willie. Er... Sorry. I'm sorry, Willie. Sorry, Willie. I'm sorry, Willie. Here, look, I bought you a dirty magazine. Oh, yeah. I can see your problem. Cheer up, Willie. Did you hear about the fella that had to have his leg amputated? Hmm? When he woke up from the operation, the doctor said, "We got some good news, we got some bad news. "The bad news is, "we've chopped the wrong leg off. "The good news is, the other one's got better." Yes, well. You know, I don't think this is going to be a particularly difficult case to solve, Miss... Sutton. Mr Radleigh? Morning, Crappie! Ow! -What?! -Will you shut up? Misunderstanding, that's part of screen comedy. I mean, what would we do without it? I mean, we are sitting in the audience, and up there on the screen are two people involved in a misunderstanding. We know it, they don't, and it's very funny to watch. Now, in the sequence we're going to see, Christopher Neil, he stars in The Adventures of a Private Eye, he's playing a private eye, of course, and he's masquerading disguised as a chorus girl, would you believe, and in his bag or briefcase he's got a lot of money, and he's going into a nightclub to meet the blackmailer who's going to give him some incriminating photographs for the money. Well, as it's a misunderstanding, we know what's gonna happen. Christopher Neil goes to the wrong table, and then he talks to the wrong man. And the wrong man turns out to be the enormous Fred Emney.

I'll say this for Tom, he certainly knows how to pick 'em. Now, she's obviously a bit of class. Probably an air hostess, or something like that. This is Nikki. She's a stripper. Well, you can't always be right, can ya? Joe's comin' to stay with us for a while. -Oh, nice. When? -How about now? You weren't kiddin', were you? Well, I don't believe in hanging about once me mind's made up. You, er... plannin' on stayin' long, then? Well, just till I get meself sorted out, find a nice little place to live. Oh, if you hear of anywhere that's going, not too expensive. Oh, yeah. Sure. She fancies me. I can tell. I could pull this one. Dead easy. No problem. I expect you're like me. Work odd hours. Yeah, I do a bit. I suppose that means we won't... see a lot of each other, then. Do you fancy a quick one before I go? Oh! Er... No, thanks. What's your name then, eh? Not speakin'? That's all right. I like a bit of mystery in my women. Not too much, though. Ooh, that's nice. Ooh! Ooh! I'll tell you what. You can eat crackers in my bed any time, eh? Oh, Christ! -Me leg! You're breaking me leg! You'll break me leg! Get off! Get off! Oh, get off! No! No, no, no. No! No! Ooh! Ah! Ah! Ooh! Ow! -No, no! Not that! No! Easy! You know, I don't think this is such a good idea. These sort of things always make me feel so nervous. Father would wish us to speak with him. I don't understand why. He had no time for you while he was alive. What are you lot doing now? We're going to have a séance. Where's Judd? Maybe he'd like to join us. Oh, he, er... He went to visit someone in town. You'll be joining us, though, won't you? Oh, no, I don't think so. I think Father's going to be very upset if you don't have a word with him. Listen, birdie, if I've got to sit through this blasted nonsense, you can as well. -Cloth! -Yes. Well, this is nice, isn't it? I always did like having my fortune told. Lights! Now if we all place our index finger very lightly on top of the glass. We are having a séance, round we all sit. If you want my opinion, it's a right load of... Everyone place their hands gently on the table, fingers lightly touching. What was that? -Is there anybody there? -My God ! Who is it? Speak! Speak! Who's there? Speak! Speak! I... I need a bloody drink. Someone touched me! Oh! Yes, yes. There's definitely someone in the room. I can feel it. I can feel it. Father, Father, is it you? Oh, my God. Supposing it's... Marmaduke Grimsdyke? Marmaduke, if it is thou, be gone, I say! Marmaduke, piss off. Who is it? Answer me, Father. If it is you, then answer me. One knock for yes. Two knocks for no. One knock for yes, two knocks for no. Who is it? Speak! Speak! Who is it? It's only me, madam. Inspector Hogg to see you. Well, if you thought that was a very funny misunderstanding, watch the next for sheer outrageousness. Joe, if I let you, you know... You wouldn't think me cheap, would you? Cheap? No, 'course not. Drinking double gins all evening. 'Course not. It's being emotionally honest. What could be wrong with that? Besides, with a fabulous figure like you got, it'd be criminal to hide it away, now, wouldn't it? I'll tell you something, you've got the most beautiful breasts I've ever seen. Have I? -I have dreams about them. -You don't. Really? I'll tell you something else, too, they're even better with nothing on. Oh, Joe... Oh, oh... Oh, Joe... Oh, darling, you're fantastic. But I haven't even got me trousers off yet. Oh... Joe... Thank goodness you're here. I was getting quite desperate. -Do come in. -Thank you. The kitchen's at the back. I tried to do it myself, but it wasn't really very satisfactory. What I really needed was a nice long tool to poke it with properly, if you see what I mean. I hunted about for hours, but I couldn't find anything satisfactory. Finally, I decided the only thing to do is to get a man round instead. Yes, well, actually, I've come to... Solve my little problem. Yes, I know. I do hope you've got the right equipment for it. It's probably just tea leaves. Oh, no, no. You've got it wrong. I'm not... Quite sure what it is. -Oh, I do understand, Mr, um... -West. You see... well, everyone thinks it's Blake. How strange. "Blake" doesn't sound a bit like "West". I suppose you'll probably try to suck it out with your little plunger. Drink? - -Make yourself at home. Sit down. Relax. I should sit over there if I were you. It's more comfortable. I'll just, er... get the wine. -There we are. -Well, here we are, then. -Have you been together long? -What? -This boy you live with. -Oh, Tom. No, just a few weeks. Well, we've known each other for a couple of years now. But we've only been living together a short time. Well, he's not going to get jealous, if he comes back and finds me here? No, probably fancy you himself. Oh, let me. Oh, must need a new flint. Hang on, I've got some matches somewhere. Sorry about that. I think that's a really great outfit you're wearin'. Oh, do you like it? I design all my own clothes. Yeah, well, it looks terrific. I suppose I shouldn't really be wearing it now, but after I finish work I just want to get away. I can't be bothered to change. Oh, no, you mustn't change. I mean, you look great as you are. A real turn-on. Honest. It's a tough one, this. Oh, do you want me to do it? No, no. It's all right. I'll get it out in a minute. Come on. Why don't you let me try? No, you'll never do it. -Have you got the glasses ready? -What? Oh, yeah. Sorry, we're a bit, er... short on glasses. Well, this is very nice. - -Thank you. I think you're very nice. You, er... comfortable, are you? Mmm. Thank you. I think you're really something. Really, I do. I hope you won't mind if I say this, but, er... I think you've got the most beautifully-shaped breasts I've ever seen. -Really beautiful. -Yes. Yes, they're much better now. Mind you, they cost me a fortune. So, um... why don't we give them a little air to breathe, eh? You've got lovely legs and all. Really lovely. I have to shave them, of course. Bloody hell ! -What's the matter? -You ! -You're a fella! -But of course I am. What did you think I was? Wonder if I could have him under the Trades Descriptions Act? I do hope you're not gonna make a mess. I've just done in here, you know. No, no, I'll just, er... hunt round for any little signs, and, er... then lay a few traps. Oh. You don't do ants, do you? -What? -Ants. Oh, yeah, we do 'em all. Ants, mice, rats, cockroaches, weevils. Only, where I live, they come in from the garden. Harry, that's my husband, he found a couple in his cornflakes the other morning. I mean, there they were, just swimmin' around as though they owned the place. Ant powder, that's what you need. Well, you can't very well put that in cornflakes, can you? Oh, I was just making myself a nice cup of tea. I don't suppose you'd fancy one? That's very kind. Thank you very much. What are you doing down there? Oh, just looking for droppings. Well, you won't find any of those. I've only just hoovered. -Do you take sugar? -No, thanks. Oh, yes. Well, I'm always finding things like that about the place. He has women here, you know. I don't mind the black ones so much. It's the big red ones I can't stand. -What? -Ants. Oh, ants. My Harry found a couple in his bed the other night. Gave him a terrible fright. He thought it was crabs. Mind you, he's a funny man. He always did attract nasty, creepy-crawly things. -Oh, my God, he's back already. -What? Quick, clear these things up. Oh, Mr Radleigh, you did give me a surprise! I was just finishing off. Who's he? Well, I hope I did right, Mr Radleigh. This gentleman is from the government. From, er... Pest Control. Oh, yes? What are you, a free sample? I hope you don't think I do this with every photographer I work with. No, of course not. Well, I can't see anyone. He must have gone. Only there was definitely someone outside prowling about in the bushes. Now, now, Miss Friggin. That makes three you say you've seen in the past week. Now, they can't all have been sex maniacs, can they? Oh, I don't agree. There are a lot of them about, you know. You've really no cause for alarm. A lot of them go for older women now. It said so in the papers. Well, don't you worry about it, Miss Friggin. Anyone tries to molest you, we are only around the corner. Well, anyway, I always look under my bed, just to make sure. But there's never anybody there. That's right. You keep doing that. And I always wear a wedding ring whenever I go out. It's where they hang about, you know, behind those bushes. -Scott. -Mmm? -What's this? -Mmm? It feels like a lump of cheese. What? God knows. Right, where were we? Oi ! You down there. Police. Hold it! Hey! You know, everybody likes to watch an embarrassing situation. Anything, as long as it doesn't happen to them. But all of us, at one time or another, have been in one, been embarrassed. And that is, of course, the basis of much comedy, human embarrassment. Wake up. Morning, Mr Prentiss. You're up early. Up early? I'm on nights this week. Oh! I'm very sorry. It happens all the while. Come in, Mr Plumber. Can I help you, sir? Pardon? -Oh! -Can I help you, sir? That, er... That big bird, it's, er... very interesting. The Grimsdyke Vulture, sir. Yeah, yeah. Who's the, er... Who's the fellow in the chain mail? Marmaduke Grimsdyke. We don't talk about him, sir. Embarrassing? Right on! I should think so! But you wait for the next one. -Hello, Maisie. -Hello, Joe. Well, come on, love. Don't be nervous, I won't bite it off. -Where to, darlin'? -Oh, the usual, love. -What, round the block? -Yeah, that'll do. Just keep on drivin'. I'll give you a yell when I'm finished. Right! Here, you heard about Glenda, didn't you? Oh, sorry, love. Be with you in a minute. -Glenda? -Yeah. She married an Arab she picked up. -I thought I hadn't seen her around. -Yeah. An Arab. -With oil wells and everything. -No! Mind you, it was only a matter of time before she hooked some old geezer. Funny, I'd never have thought that about her. -What, getting married? -Yeah. What, Glenda? You're joking. Every time she opened her mouth a wedding bell popped out. So how's business with you? Oh, well, it's quietened down a bit now the tourist season's over, but I don't do so bad. Tell you what, love, you get it out and start practising, and I'll join you in a minute. Here, Joe, could I have this one on credit? You know, I've just had the electricity bill in... Yeah, that's okay. Oh, you are lovely. I'll make it up next time, I promise. Nah, don't worry about it. It's my pleasure. I'll tell you what, I didn't half get a fright the other week. I thought I'd caught a dose, didn't I? All right. Don't worry. You have a very nasty cough there. You should get it seen to. It might be serious. That's the fourth one I've had this week with a cold. I only hope to God I don't go down with it. That's my trouble, you know. Anything that's goin' the rounds, I seem to pick up. Yeah, I had noticed. Anyway, love, can't sit here chatting all day. I've got to get back to work. Ah! Oh, my God. Er... That'll be twenty pounds. My chequebook's on the dressing table. Would you bring it over here? Sit down. Here, what're you doin'?! You have me at your mercy. I'm in your power. I'm helpless. -Rubbish. -They bind me to you. I'm yours. Do with me what you will. Yeah, well, you might have waited till I'd got me shirt off. Oh. Oh! What a lovely hairy chest. Oh, you're so powerful, so overwhelming. Here, what about your husband? -Bill ! Where are you? -Yeah. Where is he? In prison. He won't be out till tomorrow. We've got one whole day to be really naughty. You are my master, I am your slave. Be rough with me. Quick, quickly. Just a minute. What? Hello? Janice? Hello, my love. Why, it's me, Billy. Yeah. I'm on me way home. Yeah, now. Keep the bed warm, darlin', eh? -Bloody hell ! -What? I must have got the day wrong. He's on his way back. -What?! -Trust him to spoil everything. -Well, what are you looking for? -The key! -What key? -The key to this. Oh, don't tell me you can't find it. -I know. It's in my handbag. -Where's that? -Downstairs. -Right. Oh! Help. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. Oh, my God. Come on, come on. It's not there. Wait a minute. I remember now. It's in my housecoat. And where exactly is your housecoat? In the bedroom. In the bedroom. Are you sure it's in your housecoat? I think so. Hang about, hang about. Oh! It's all right, all right. What was he inside for? Grievous bodily harm. BOB: Mmm, Clarissa... Oh, Judd... In! Out! In! Out! In! Out! Put your backs into it! In! Out! In! Out! In! Out! In! Out! In! Out! In! Out! In! Out! In! Out! It's no use hiding. I know you're in there, Joe North. Bloody hell, that's all I need. Answer this door or I'll scream the place down. You let me in or, I'm warning you, I'll get the police to knock the door in. -Oh, Carol. -You took your time, didn't ya? -Where is he? -Who? Oh, Joe. Who did you think I meant? Mickey Mouse? He's out. Working. What? When his taxi's here? What's he driving? Horse and cart? His taxi's not here. He's out in it. Really. Well, I have just bumped into the tall lady from N umber 3, with the toy poodle and the blue rinse. And, according to her, Joe's taxi drove into your garage ten minutes ago. So, unless it's gone straight through your back wall, it's still here, innit? Well, you see, I wouldn't know about that, 'cause, er... I was asleep. He's up there, isn't he? He's up there with another bloody bird ! Oh! Joe, get rid of her. -What am I supposed to do? -Joe North, I'm coming up, and if I find you in a compromising position with your knickers down, I'll... Oh. -Didn't know you had company. -Hello, Carol. Shalom. Hi-yah! What are we supposed to be helping his enquiries with? Carol, love. It's to do with sex, isn't it? You've been having orgies up here, haven't you? That's what it is, isn't it? -Orgies. -No, ma'am. Well, it must be something like that. I mean, if Joe's anything to do with it, it must be sexy. You've got a one-track mind, you have. All right, if it's not orgies, what is it, then? You might say it's a little treasure hunt. Joe, what have you got yourself mixed up with now? -Nothing. -I bet you have. Especially if there's a woman involved. -Listen, there's nothing up here. -Not according to your two friends. We've got 'em outside. -Picked 'em up a few minutes ago. -What two friends? We know all about your little caper at the jewellers. I'm sorry, I really don't know what you're talking about. Why don't you just come clean? Your friends have. Found any little trinkets yet? Not yet, sir. TOM: You're not gonna find anything, you know. We'll see. Life's full of little surprises, isn't it? Jesus Christ! I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to shout. It's just there's a bloody snake in there. That is Monty. He is my speciality and he's very highly strung. Please don't upset him. He's got a performance tonight. Hey! Look, I'm... I'm sorry about your car, love, but... You're looking for stolen property. Carol, why don't you belt up? But the cheek of it. I mean, comin' in here and searching this place like we were all criminals. No, you tell him, Joe. Go on, tell him. Carol, Carol, will you shut up, Carol? Go on. Go on, tell him. Ask to see his search warrant. Go on. Ask. Ask. Go on. Go on. If you don't ask, I shall never speak to you again, even though I have forgiven you. Have you got something to say, then? -Well, um, Inspector... -Go on, go on, tell him to get out. Yes, um... And tell him to apologise. Tell him you know your rights. Tell him you'll sue him for libel if he don't apologise. She'll get me jailed for life. Well, go on, Joe, tell him. Joe is my fiancé. Well, um, Inspector, as you don't appear to have found anything... That's right. Really lay it on him. I suggest we, um, call it a day. -Don't you? -That's a bit pathetic, innit? -Carol ! -Well, I mean, he's just called us a bunch of criminals. We could sue him for that. Excuse me, ma'am, I haven't called any of you criminals. Yet. Oh, yes, you did. I heard you. You said we had stolen goods. What sort of people do you think we are? Accusing us of being criminals. -We are respectable, we are. -Nikki ! I have never done anything criminal in my life. -I work in a supermarket. -Nikki ! And as for Joe, well, he's a taxi driver. And Peter is, well... And as for Tom, well, you could hardly call him a criminal. He's a mechanic. -Nikki... -And Nikki, well, she's respectable. She's a stripper. Nikki ! And so the last thing you could ever find in this place would be stolen property. "Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer, "but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty."
