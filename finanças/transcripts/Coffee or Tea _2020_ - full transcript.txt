Yes - Are you fired? - Of course not! I fired my boss. I'm starting my own delivery business Anyone can start a business these days I used to believe as long as I'm making a difference of the world even if I fail eventually it's my business that fails, not me I was wrong I am the failure Well said I'm writing in down It's the business that failed not the person You think it's well said? Of course! I never lie to my friend I'm just a client Not really your friend We've known each other for so long I've always treated you as a friend I'm leaving, you? I'm leaving as well Where to? Hunan Hainan, Yunnan Wherever Yunnan? I'm going back to Yunnan! Come with me! With you? You're my friend, let's go together In your case, a good crying will help a lot A client of mine told me Don't focus on whether you can succeed or not Focus on your destination despite the hardships on the road Only fools believe this There's nothing at the destination, it's just far away Another client told me One cannot be defeated if you can rise up again When you are defeated more than enough times you'll know it's easiest to lie down Many of my clients have returned to their hometowns They are doing pretty well They look happy on social media There's no traffic jam, no car crash No cold-shoulder or sneers in the countryside I've never given up my hopes Sing with me Forgive my passion for freedom Even someday I may fall hard... Rise Old Li, get down here! Let young people do it! I can't trust others with the ancestor worship ceremony I have to do it myself If I piss off a person I can apologize But pissing off the ancestors, that I can't afford Rest assured, my legs are still strong Don't jinx it Be quiet Hurry up, it's the tea god ceremony! That's the head of our village The fireworks rose higher than we could get it to Stop there! Why don't you stay in the city like others? Beating up your son can't solve any problem Stop chasing him around Let him explain himself first You used to beat up your son like he was a thief Now you ask me to stop? None of your business Let's not change the subject And dare you mention my dead son again! Shaoqun is dead? For many years Don't interrupt adults Come Just talk to me I'll reason it out What's the reason you decided to come back? I came back to start my own business I want to open a package delivery shop here in the village Go on Stop yelling! I haven't even touched you It wasn't me Don't move The best cure to insect sting is to have a cow lick it If you move around and startle it it may lick the wrong place I feel so dirty So dirty Eat, and you'll recover fast Villagers, may I say a few words The fireworks at the ceremony had a small accident But as long as our prayer was sincere our ancestor would hear it We will have a big tea harvest this year! So what? We'll still have a hard time selling it Isn't our tea of great quality? Nowadays only aged Pu'er tea cakes can sell New leaves are valueless We have to crush them and sell the bagged tea to factories Praying to the ancestors is useless The tea factories owners are our god The tea factories owners are our god Who said that! He heard that? It's a great day today so I will keep my cool Who was talking just now Stand up! I make less than 500 yuan on average every month Whoever wants to keep growing tea, go ahead Just saying, even construction workers make 80 yuan a day in cities Fuck off! Number of Young People Leaving the Village: What don't you sell your tea online? How would you know the taste by looking at photos? Villagers, eat! Eat! It tastes good indeed Nevertheless, the competition is fierce the core customers are elders who don't do much online shopping and the tea lacks branding No wonder it doesn't sell I'm blabbing about work again The closest delivery shop to Huanglu Village is 20km away For this reason, almost nobody here does online shopping When I was a delivery guy in the city we fought for every potential customer You know why? In delivery business your customer base is the goldmine If I can start a delivery business here use our village as a portal to cover the last-mile service in neighboring villages One day, the number of rural population in China will be the number of my customers I'm not coming back to this shithole! I'm not coming back to this shithole! Number of Young People Leaving the Village: Number of Young People Leaving the Village: Except for these guys Doesn't it look like honey? All you need is a straw to suck it out No it doesn't It looks like shit You put a straw in it you are stirring the shit pot You have to understand The reason why there's no delivery here is that no one shops online It's not the other way round Don't confuse cause and effect I took a good look at the villagers during the banquet Asides from the few young people who just left there are only old people and children That being said those who stay in the village are not your customers The ones who left are That's why I'm giving you my thoughts You are in e-commerce and I'm a delivery guy We are a perfect match Enough I don't need another failure That's why you are in urgent need of success I don't need success I need to stay away from failure I'm leaving Is that a deal? Get lost! Go Easy, easy If it wasn't because my shrink's advise I would have done anything to go back Your eye is recovered? The licking works Have some tea Today is the 23rd day of my insomnia The second day I'm in Huanglu Village I'll probably never be able to fall asleep again Today is the first day of my startup I've figured it all out in Beijing I'm only three steps from success The first step: merge and acquisition DO NOT MENTION LI SHAOQUN Before Shaoqun died what heinous crime did he commit? How much? Two yuan I'm talking about your shop Step two, recruiting Xiubing Delivery fast and accessible secure and reliable deliver to your home with one click! Xiubing delivers everywhere Xiubing brings convenience to us all! Great! This guy used to be a postman Where there was human, there was me This guy used to be a barber Where there was human head, there was me Yay This guy... is really something I used to be a feces collector Where there was human feces... now I'm saying it it sounds inappropriate... They've spent their lives running around this town They know every road by heart They know every road by heart Having them as our delivery men will greatly increase our efficiency What do you think? What have I got to do with it? You're my business partner this is our opening day, you need to say something... Since when I became your partner... A round of applause! These men have a combined age of more than 1000 years old Having them deliver packages I'm worried that before they can send off the packages the packages would send them off the world You brat look at your leg, you think you're better than us? Uncle, for my sake Enough of talking, just show him what you've got Iron fist Assemble! How was it? If there's no online shopping there's no package to deliver It's useless to hire delivery men That I already have the solution Online shopping 101 Step 1, register an online banking account Step 2, download a payment app Stop It's too complicated I spent three days working on it This is the easiest tutorial I can solve your problem with one simple trick That's not possible - Do you want to buy stuff online? - Yes Give me your money, I'll do it for you If you want something why do you care how you get it? Anyone going to the farmer's market? Seems like your biggest competitor is that market Let's go meet the competitor Step three, expand the market share If not seeing it myself I wouldn't believe that people still do shopping in this primitive way But they are all our potential customers What do you want? Give me the money, I'll buy it for you No need. What a wacko Don't get distracted you're not here to sell goods you're selling the concept of online shopping I get it Villagers listen up everything here you can buy online They are cheap and of good quality If you don't know how to do online shopping just give me the money I'll place orders for you Hello, come on in, what can I get for you?

I'm not smart I don't know how to talk about big ideas but I know what's the right thing to do Your method definitely works It worked last time People who wanted to beat us got overcrowded They couldn't even reach us I'm going again tomorrow You should just give up on the delivery business The whole idea is wrong so every step followed is a misstep The more you persist the more mistakes you make I've done one thing right What is it? I brought you back Since I decided to open the shop It's the best decision I've made You have my word If my shop becomes successful You'll have a share as my business partner I didn't agree to become a partner Then you be the boss, I'll be the manager That's not what I meant I could be your consultant I promise - I'll make you a partner as soon as... - I said I don't want to be a partner Excuse me I heard you have a lot of cheap goods?

If I go to more markets, get beaten up more I can attract more customers I think my body can withstand seven or eight more beatings We make 1.5 yuan per package There are 12 villages in the area Assuming each village has 100 aunties and 50 kids who do online shopping Then the delivery fee in total would be...

Go without me I wouldn't understand the ghost's dialect We go together Did you see it? No Anyone home? You've got a package Peng Xiubing Why do people say you're dead? Five years ago I chopped down tea trees to grow coffee Since then I'm dead to my father You chopped down tea trees to grow this? And you? Couldn't make it in Beijing, forced to come back? I'm not like you I was doing pretty well in Beijing I came back to start my business and make big bucks All you talk about is money I left Beijing just to stay away from people like you I didn't expect to see two today Two? I'm not like him Please Coffee at this hour? Dump it if you don't drink it. - Whatever - Wait This coffee is really good The pre-fermentation adds flavor complexity You are a coffee person? I spent three years trying many different ways of fermentation and finally produced this flavor On first taste you get flavors of tropical fruits Tangerine, plum, orange peel apricot and wild ginger flowers their sweetness and sourness are brought out perfectly mixed with strong aroma of dark cocoa The coffee tastes smooth, and its flavors are layered well Doesn't it taste like forests and mountains? Yes It finishes with a touch of nuts vanilla and caramel The aftertaste lingers on your tongue I've never met a coffee connoisseur like you since I came back to the village Li Shaoqun Wei Jinbei He's MY friend I didn't say anything when you stole Wang Saifen from me You're stealing my man too? Who is Wang Saifen? - My girlfriend - My girlfriend - Mine - Whose girlfriend is she? - That's not important - It's very important! Whatever. I'm not going to charge you for the package I just opened a delivery shop, please come visit Put it down I don't need delivery, I already have a car Running a delivery service here...You're not going to have any success Beat it Come back soon, Jinbei No problem He's still as mean as ten years ago No wonder people wish he was dead He owns a car and so what? I swear I'm going to make him use my service Dear villagers We are raising fund for construction projects With the money we will build wide cement roads We will install a running water system Making our village better is everyone's duty Please make a small contribution Help us raise a big fund We don't have much to spare Either keep the fridge, or the piglet - You choose - The fridge works well Where are you going? Where are you going? You can't sell my piglet I think I'll need to get a job Dad where can you find a job at your age? Who would hire you? Xiubing probably will I'll ask my son to send back some money His life is much harder than ours Who are you showing all this makeup to Return everything! Here, we bought you a new one. Give it a try. Not used to it, don't like it, it's not comfy Try it, we already spent the money We had a low yield this year. Don't waste money! We can return it Why there's no water? Is it broken? Broken? New bike? Yes, new motorbike The seat is a little too high, I'm going to return it The hair dryer is burnt out, what should I do? Xiubing can return it Ask Xiubing to return it If you don't like it, you can return it - What items can I return? - Anything you bought I don't care - I bought it from you - Yes you can return it but we need to talk to the sellers first Not everything is refundable My wife bought the wrong dye Her hair is green now, she can't stop complaining I wanted chocolate Not chocolate mush I need money for fertilizers There's no use keeping this! I spent so much on the shoes They came in with two left foot The cookies came in crushed I want refund! Everyone is returning, so I'm doing it too You picked your own purchase We simply placed orders for you We didn't make any money from it Okay, okay! Peng Xiubing This is not how you do business If you agree to return everything. There's no way we can afford the refund You need to listen to me this time It already took longer for packages to deliver get here They've probably missed the return window by now It's our village's business You outsider stay out of it Xiubing We've known you since you were little Everyone here We all trust you That's why we choose to buy from your shop Tea sales hasn't been good recently Didn't you say we can ask for return? Okay I'll return everything! I understand But there are dozens of villages here tens of thousands of people They are all your future customers Is it possible if... Well The deadline has passed You can't return any of these Is it true you can fly when there's favorable wind? I don't know All I know when the wind stops I am the first one to fall You know I lived in a basement when I was in Beijing I spent no more than 20 yuan on meals every day I made 1 yuan per package When others could deliver 150 packages I did 180 or even 200 There are liftless buildings no one wanted to deliver to I'd do it just to make an extra 1 yuan In the past ten years the packages I've sent are probably as tall as a mountain Now the mountain has collapsed Wake up You can return none of these Don't think about it Peng Xiubing I was talking to you I thought it was the pig I felt like talking to a pig Zero Are you asleep? Yes Is this insomnia? You know how much you lost this time? 193895.6 yuan I don't get it Why did you agree to return everything? In my village some things are more important than money As long as we act with honesty we can keep doing business here This was first time they did online shopping They will get used to it with time The money you make per package is nothing You won't be able to make the loss back in ten years You failed hard this time Says who? I just haven't succeeded yet It doesn't mean I have failed It's not like I'll starve Plus all the paper boxes we can sell them for a few dozen yuan Then I'll have the money for food Then I'll have the energy to work Then I can keep delivering packages Then I'll make money again I probably will live to at least 80 years old There are several decades ahead, why should I worry? I don't have much saving Tomorrow I'll make a few calls See if I borrow some money for you I thought I'm your only friend. Who will you borrow money from? Sorry, that's not what I meant You're right You're my only friend Otherwise why would I stay here in this god-forsaken village I'm not good at consoling people... I remember one rainy day you delivered my package You were soaked through but my package was dry Peng Xiubing, you son of a gun I've been thinking all night Sending packages out is also part of delivery service Since there aren't many shopping online We need to find a way to sell what we have here to the outside - What should we sell? - You deliver everything with one click? Yes Can you deliver my mom here? Where is she? Guangzhou. She didn't come back for Chinese New Year Yang Tao, this is a gift from your mom Will your shop be here forever? It will Peng Xiubing I know you took down my tyres! I swear I'll tear down your shop! Suit yourself I'm going out of business anyways What happened, idiot How about is mine? Are you going to drink it? I may not, but you have to make it I have a few dozen packages to send If you have no other things to do send them for me I don't need your pity My bad for taking down your tyres I'll put them back on Whatever Shaoqun The packages you are sending are all coffee Are you selling it? My coffee is not for sale How many coffee trees do you have? More than 700. Less than 0.32 acre What's the yield? According to my standard one tree produces 3-5 kg of beans After procession 1/8 of them are kept Let's say one tree produces 0.5kg of processed beans 700 trees can produce 350kg of beans Let me help you sell your coffee I'll help you sell it Are you kidding me This coffee is far from ready to go into the market Plus, every acre of land here is covered with Pu'er tree Where can I grow coffee? We'll find land for you You take charge of farming. I'll do sales and marketing I'm sure we can make money together Excuse me, now you want to help him? You aren't remotely interested in my delivery shop! Are you stupid or dumb? If Shaoqun sells his coffee who do you think will deliver all the packages? Me. It's me. Sell it! Don't be stupid What's wrong with making money? I'll give you a 20% discount on the delivery fee Enough I've told you, I grow coffee trees because I like coffee There's no way I'm selling it You like coffee? You could have grown one tree just for fun Instead you grew 700 trees Isn't that a waste of resources? You are meaner than my dad Hey, you said you like coffee I wasn't trying to take advantage of you Get out Wow, I'm so scared One day I'll make you sell your coffee. You have my word Let's go, he doesn't want us here He doesn't want you here, not me I'm not done with my coffee yet He stole your heart with a cup of coffee I'm walking back on my own You sure you're not selling? I'm sure You even took his beans back. It wasn't enough coffee for you? It tastes great You claimed to be my friend Now you want to defect Go drink it at your place. Don't do it here When you go to the town today, send these I was kidding. You're really sending the beans back home? Wait, you have a home in America? And one in Italy? Hear me out From tomorrow you treat Shaoqun nicely Go check in with him every day Even if he threatens to kick you out Just stay there I'm not going. Not losing my dignity. You want to keep the delivery shop right? Yes, most definitely Then let's find a way to use Shaoqun's coffee to support your business æ„ Hello? Yes, I'm Li Shaoqun I'm Li Shaoqun Ok Yang Tao, be quiet Yes, I'm Li Shaoqun I'm Li Shaoqun Hello? No signal? No signal? Hello? Can you hear me? I'm Li Shaoqun I'm Li Shaoqun Mr. Li, Li Shaoqun Li Shaoqun How come you're all Li Shaoqun? I sent your beans to a world raw beans competition on your behalf Who gave you the permission? Let's talk about it later The results come out today Do you want to know? I got signal Okay Thank you How was it? They received several thousand samples this year all top quality beans in the world Your coffee won second place You said you don't think much of your coffee now it's internationally recognized What was the prize? Silver medal, in the coffee olympics Olympics silver medal We won gold in the Olympics! Why does our tea price keep dropping? It is not as good as other villages'? They offered us this price for our top quality The supplier lowered the price again We can't undersell It's a disgrace They are good years and bad years For a thousand years It's been like this We won gold in the Olympics! We won gold in the Olympics! We won gold in the Olympics! When I was a kid I used to hide here when my father wanted to beat me They say as you grow older trees will look smaller How come this one still looks so tall? Come up here You never see a sky like this in Beijing I wish I could be a kid again I left home at 16 after a big fight with my father I left this village I swore that once I left, I'd never come back But you're back, aren't you? I've learnt in the past ten years the city is not my home I came back Turns out the village doesn't feel like home either My dad used to fight with me a lot Now he doesn't even bother At least fighting is a way of communication My dad forced me to learn tea making when I was young Only he got to decide what taste was good I knew in my life, I would never be good enough Coffee is probably my way of defiance What I didn't expect, is that coffee chose here Everything comes full circle Call it fate It was our fate to be born here We can't change it But that doesn't mean we can't change this place You talked about "in your life" but a lifetime is long enough to do anything We were quite alike So eager to go beyond the mountain that we forgot what's like here Alright I've decided to spend the night here You? He has problem falling asleep Not able to sleep? Ever since I decided to start my own business I have never had a good night's sleep I was busy researching future trends and the next hot thing Worried that I'd miss out on new opportunities But the more you care, the less control you have I blamed bad luck for my failures Later I realized it was me that had failed Because of my insomnia, I started taking diazepam One pill per day at the beginning Later even four pills couldn't put me to sleep I looked it up online Someone suggested I take ten pills Since the medicine lost effect on me I had to stay away from windows Whenever I stood near I felt a strong urge to jump He's asleep What's the matter with you two? You fell asleep! I fell asleep? I did! I worked in the tallest office building in Beijing for two years But I've never looked this far Consultant What's our chance of success now? I don't want to be a consultant anymore You love coffee You love delivery And I want to be in e-commerce Let's become business partners Let's do it Three clients from Beijing once told me Never start a business with your best friends Sounds so old-fashioned. What do they do? They teach English No wonder Three factors that determine agricultural commercialization Product, logistics, and sales They fall precisely inside our areas of expertise A successful business demands right timing, right location and right people We have the right timing and people all we need is more land for production The current yield of you trees... it doesn't worth the effort to build a business around it It's too small We should apply for poverty-relief loans Increase our production Use our current plantation as a base and gradually expand to nearby areas It sounds complicated, isn't it? I've done the calculation There are more than 1000 people in our village The conservative estimation of arable land per person let's say is 0.22 acres With your reputation and the great prospect of Pu'er coffee as long as we can convince half of the villagers to grow coffee we will achieve mass production Of all the 1000 potential coffee farmers you have to convince one person first in order to win the others over Who? Your dad has that kind of power? The villagers all listen to him especially the elders But you're his son Precisely I'll go talk to him You're not afraid of him? Your dad beats you too? Yes Is it bad? Last time I woke up in a hospital after the beating I couldn't remember a thing He's not young anymore Is his still in good shape? Any chronic diseases I should know? What are you thinking? Our village can't thrive without your support I'd like to thank you all! Isn't the broadcasting room in your home? Hello? Hello? Fellow villagers, this is Peng Xiubing speaking Please allow me to say a few words He took my place! There used to be 1600 people in our village Nearly half of them are working somewhere else In our village, none of the families is complete I... like many young people chose to go work in big cities thinking that our lives could be changed for the better And there'd be no need to come back But city streets are too clean for us to leave our footprints On the very day I came back I made my own footprint on the dirt road An evidence of my being There's no place we can call home except for this one! In cities perseverance helps us survive We need the same spirit here as well! I know you all have deep feelings for tea I do, too But it can no longer sustain our village Li Shaoqun's coffee just won silver in a world beans competition If we grow his coffee we will have higher income And if the coffee sells well there will be job opportunities for everyone So that no one has to find a job elsewhere No more living in the basement No more being railed at just to make a few more bucks Mo more pretending on phone calls with our families that things are great telling them "don't worry about me" People like me they can all come home They don't need to be in a place where they can't leave their footprints where they can't be with families and kids Our mothers and fathers can come home Our sons and daughters can come home Our wives and husbands can come home to where they belong Coffee not only changes my life It will change yours, too You have my promise! Son of a gun! Run! I... Who gave you the permission to use my broadcast? Anyone who's interested, come to the coffee plantation for seedlings! You're destroying our legacy! Don't worry I'm not going to get physical, or scold anyone You are all adults now you have your own ideas But has it ever occurred to you You guys are still young and can afford failures But them How about them? The villagers can't afford it You can always go back to cities if you fail But for them they have nowhere to go I'm being responsible for their lives Mr. Li You're Shaoqun's father Not the villagers' father You should let them decide I didn't fire you guys I'm just pretty strapped recently I have no money to pay you We are not asking for our pay We are here to get coffee seedlings You can use my land to grow coffee But I can't pay you for anything yet Not until the plants are grown It doesn't matter We don't care about coffee But we trust you My whole family we all trust you We are to learn how to grow coffee trees I'll teach you Let's get rid of weeds Hurry up Drink tea It's like you're holding human ashes not coffee Why don't you do it?

Close your eyes Feel it I hear them With so many trees you'll probably going to talk till morning I know a pretty good therapist in Beijing You should go see him You try it Hello Coffee, this is Pu'er Tea Do you copy? Copy, copy Pu'er this is Coffee. What are you doing? I have a Mr. Li Shaoqun talking to me I choose coffee to distance myself from my dad Oddly enough I couldn't understand him before I grew coffee Since I choose coffee I think I understand him better I've been waiting for this moment all my life I always thought When I could outdo my father I wouldn't care what he thinks of me But now the day has finally become I'm dying to hear his thoughts Even a good scolding from him I don't know I think I'm drunk I really want some tea Actually I can fulfill your wish Come here I'll brew some tea for you, son Buzz off! Jump and you'll know if you can fly Jump. Be brave Jump One Month Later One Month Later That horse looks so lost It doesn't know where to go You remember last time you came you said it was dying Did I? It's been a while since your last visit The other patients who share your symptoms are either dead or they are cured I followed your advice and went to Yunnan I thought it was a just trip for relaxing but it ended up curing my insomnia So I decided to stay Later I even started a coffee business with two friends Then I ran into a small mishap I just came back last month A car from outside So rude Could it be the big client you talked about? Nice to meet you Nice to meet you Wei Jinbei What did she say? She said Li Shaoqun is better looking than you We have pulped natural, washed, and miel Which one do you want? I'm good, thank you Give it a try Since you here to do your research You coffee is Arabica A mixture of Bourbon related-variety and Tropica-related variety Your plantation has a size of less than 23 acres 50 thousand trees Yield last year was 14 tons You're not here to buy coffee? Allow me to introduce myself I'm the head of Marketing Management of Starnest Asia Of course I'm here to buy coffee Not your current beans but the future ones What does she mean? They want to acquire us That's right According to my research Your sales last year was 1.2 million minus cost, taxes and your dividends Your net profit should be around 280 thousand Using your growth rate for the next ten years I give you 3 million 3 million? Each of us one million? Indeed you're a big company Very accurate research Sadly your data is a little outdated Yes, our yield was 14 tons last year But this year the number will go up to 20 at least and 30 next year I believe in the near future We will be able to produce 100 tons annually No, no, no, no 20 tons will be your maximum capacity It won't go higher than that I will offer you 4 million You decide We trust you The three of us 2 million each, 6 in total My bottom line You're not worth it I'll let you reconsider your price I still have 20 minutes That's fine The decision is above your paygrade Kindly reminder You don't have 20 minutes We are all busy Excuse me Isn't 6 million too high? I've done the calculation 6 is the max. they can offer Hello Peter They want six Let's roll the dice Maybe we'll win big 6 million We sign now If I was in charge I wouldn't have offered you that amount Any questions? Just curious If you don't think we are worth the price Why did you make the offer? It's simple In the future in Yunnan or in China We don't want to see any plantation that's not ours I'll send you our beans I'll send you our beans You will grow coffee following our standards We can't grow our own? After the acquisition of course you follow our rules All good, we can sign the contract now So you don't think much of our coffee? Of course she does That's why she offered us 6 million That's not true. They're spending 6 million to make us disappear I'm not signing it Is that what she wants? Well, I'll leave you guys to discuss Li Shaoqun I raised the price to 6 million Now you decided not to sell it? I have no plan of selling you know it The whole point of starting a business is to sell it one day If you're not happy with the offer, I'll talk to her Don't be so unreasonable We know better than anyone Our max. yield annually is 20 tons 6 million is as much as we can get Take the money. You can do whatever you want with it Growing coffee is what I want to do I'm already doing it Sorry to interrupt You know why I don't support the decision to spend 6 million on your coffee? It has nothing to do with money I just find it unnecessary You know how I feel about this place? Hopeless It has no future Geisha, the best coffee breed in the world has been grown in Ethiopia for almost a century In the one hundred years Starnest has grown into the most successful coffee supplier in the world What did coffee bring to Ethiopia? Nothing I have every right to believe you guys are no threat to us I just feel bad for you You are meant to fail You are meant to fail Of course not everyone is as lucky as you Your failure is at least paid for Even if you don't sign the contract Starnest is still the most successful coffee supplier in the world If you sign it you will become the most successful farmers in China Everyone has his place in the world Isn't it great if we can achieve success in our respective positions? You farmers grow the plants We entrepreneurs sell the products Let's just stick to what we're supposed to do It's not the kind of success we want If the purpose of this acquisition is to eliminate other coffee beans please see yourself out Fine About today I'll report everything to the company Your coffee is okay but you guys are...horrible - Sorry - Don't bother I've made my point very clear Shaoqun I'll take 1 million. You can take 3 Just let me succeed one time, can you? I don't want the money, I want my coffee Okay Xiubing you sign the contract There are three of us Two to one We don't need your approval Sign the contract I'm not signing it, either I promised the villagers to make a change If we sell our coffee to Starnest What difference does it make from selling our tea to the suppliers? And I don't think my hometown is hopeless There's no hope here If you sign the contract Starnest can bring it hope What if it cannot? What will I tell the villagers? Am I letting an outsider decide the fate of my town? Outsider? You mean me? No, I didn't mean it I'm just saying if we sign the deal You can leave with the money, but we can't I thought after three years living here getting myself all tanned I'm finally one of you Turns out I'm still not, am I? That's not what I meant Peng Xiubing Listen, I don't care what you meant What makes you think you are able to make a change? Everything you say was borrowed from a client Do you have your own thoughts? Everything you have done since you came home I told you to do so Are you experienced? Are you experienced? You really believe that all your wild thoughts could be considered wisdom? Do you know what you want to do? And you... If you sign the contract your villagers will be guaranteed a stable income They offered to help us without asking anything in return Have you ever considered them? You are not idealistic You're just being selfish You remind me of how I used to be I don't want you to become like that Let me tell you this A person who's afraid of failing who can't stay true to himself is a total loser He was right You are an outsider You came here because you couldn't make it in Beijing This is a vacation spot for you This is a vacation spot for you You stayed because you smelled money Are you willing to stay here forever treating it like your own home? Will you? I used to think I would But not anymore I'm wasting my breath It's over I know I'm not as smart as you But you know what I know clearly what I want so does Shaoqun I thought you do too Xiubing On the darkest day of my life After I came out of the therapist's office Truth be told I went to the rooftop to end my life but because the package you delivered I decided not to jump I owed you one. You owed my one We're even Good bye I've been back for a month Every time I close my eyes I only see coffee trees in Yunnan its insects cows and stars Every tree I remember where it stands I know every person in the village I know every person in the village If I could stay there forever I would even believe two friends are all I need in my life two friends are all I need in my life I want a cup of coffee I'd never thought that I would stay in a village where delivery was not available taking care of coffee trees for three years I'm almost 30 now I've been thinking recently What have I done with the 30 years of my life? This projector is China's first model that supports 4K format It is connected via bluetooth, very portable Wherever you go... You are the fifth this month to pitch me this product This is our best selling coffee It's from Yunnan You are not a coffee person right? Is Chinese coffee even considered coffee? How is it? Still tastes bitter to me I don't know why people like this taste Give it a try This coffee is pretty good Next time Bitterness has its own flavor After I came back to Beijing I noticed for the first time how big it is Too big that if I don't use GPS I will have no idea where I am Too big that when I run into familiar faces I can't remember their names The village in Yunnan was small But I never lost my direction The life you had in the village wasn't just a dream It is how you suppose to live It is how you suppose to live The coffee thing you mention sadly I don't know much about it Recently I've been reading a classic novel from the West A wise old character's words may help you He said We all face the choice between what is right and what is easy Did we make the right choice? If you want to achieve something you need to believe in it Did you follow me all the way here? I'm listening to the trees Close your eyes Listen with your heart Can I bring you home? I think I know what I should do Thank you You're welcome By the way What was the novel you mentioned? I want to take a look Harry Potter I was quoting Dumbledore I... I never see you as an outsider I know I saw myself as one I used to see your village as a sanatorium far away from the city I'd go back whenever I feel better When I was in Beijing I spent half the time daydreaming half the time in a daze Even since I came to your village I spent my days working and my nights dreaming Those who can fall asleep are able to dream I had it figured out before I came back Pu'er coffee needs to become its own brand If we sell it to suppliers having them market it as an import no one will ever know that the coffee is from China Why can't we have our own coffee? To do this it takes not only the three of us but also the whole village's effort With your delivery service Pu'er coffee can go direct to customer Since we cannot change our positions in the world let's change the world Yes! Let's change the world together We are not afraid even if we failed Because it's the business that has failed, not us Which of your clients said that? Actually You did You are not leaving this time? No I used to think that you needed me more Turns out I need you guys more And coffee! And delivery too! To your home with one click! The product I'm introducing today is very special Let me ask you when you hear the word Pu'er you will first think of tea right? But today I'm going to recommend you something different It is called Pu'er Coffee It is 100% Made in China Since it came out it has already won several international awards and become the first choice of coffee served in Michelin star restaurants Pu'er is not just coffee but also something we should take proud of as Chinese As well as a symbol for quality lifestyle Anything else you want to add? It took us three years to launch this product We have one goal To make coffee about coffee as opposed to big companies that standardize everything I think they are not selling coffee They are selling the look of their coffee shops - I have... - Well said! As an entrepreneur to be honest if it takes three years to launch a product Making money is not as important as bringing the best coffee to the world and share it with all of you Most people haven't been able to try the real taste of coffee The real taste of coffee? I'm already loving it I'd love know what the real taste is like Does it taste like mountains and forests? Yes I tasted it It makes you feel hopeful about life Oh my god Buy it! Girls!

Should I deliver it? It's okay I'll do it I thought you deliver to home Why did you leave it outside? Give it a try Tastes nasty! What are you laughing at? When you forced me to drink tea I said the same thing I didn't really mean what I said Here drink with me I want some tea Drink your tea Not bad, huh? How about regrets or pities? I loved the farmers' market when I was young At that time I... Now no one comes to the market anymore One time I was at the market... I met my husband here at the market But... He died last year He's dead and I'm old No one sells in the market and no one visits it anymore Grandma, we need to get going Do you guys have cash? No No pity The farmers' market will always exist Only it will become bigger The thing I'm most proud of is that with our sincerity and effort we've changed a place and its people Young people like you, is the future tomorrow!
