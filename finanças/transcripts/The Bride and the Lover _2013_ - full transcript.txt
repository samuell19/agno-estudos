Then produce a substitute! No! No! I'm telling you! Of course! I need a girl. There. Put it there. How do you think a guy can sing "I Will Always Love You"? [scoffs] Stupid. Um… Vivian, don't worry. [hesitates] I'm sure they can find a replacement. Why? Did she suddenly get sick? [groans] I swear! I promise you, I will ruin that woman's career! [chuckles] Relax. [cellphone ringing] Hello, Ma! [Gloria] Philip, the driver isn't here yet. The driver is already on his way. -[indistinct chatter] -We're here at the lobby. Have you had breakfast? Yes, a while ago. Will the driver recognize us? I've got to go now. I'll call the driver. -[puts cell phone down] -[sighs] -[Cora] Stop it! -Oh! Manang, she's been waiting for that for so long. Give it to her now! Hurry! -[indistinct chatter] -[children giggle] -[Shiela] Don't let the children sweat! -Yes, ma'am. Why are you guys still here? -You should be at the church! -[woman] Yes, we will be going now. Hurry up! Go! The bride's coming down! -I'm on a diet. -[woman] Kids, hurry. Gia! Pinky! You can go ahead in the car. -Okay. Okay. See you! -See you! -Cora, Cora! Get the blower! Hurry! -Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. She might feel hot when she comes out. Hi, Auntie! Um… She's coming out soon. Daddy, it's just finishing touches and it's all done. And how about you? Why aren't you dressed yet? Uh… I'll be ready in ten seconds. -Get dressed. -Yes, Uncle. Go ahead. Please go ahead. Come here! Assist them. -[woman] Bye. -Bye. Ready? [camera shutter clicks] Slowly. One step at a time. -[camera shutter clicks] -[chuckles] Yaya, come assist her. Slowly, you might step on the veil. Thank you. -Shiela, can you stay with me? -[instrumental music concludes] I can't. I need to go ahead to the church. Are you more nervous than me? Why? Come on. I'm so happy for you. -[chuckles softly] -Why? Friend, if you have something to tell me, just spit it out now. We are friends. You're my best friend. No secrets. Hey. This is your big day. You're right. This is probably gonna be the most unforgettable day of my life. [chuckles softly, groans softly] -[ducks quacking] -[guests applauding] [soft music playing] [indistinct chatter] -[giggles] Please wait. -[laughs] [indistinct chatter] [man] Perfect. [soft music concludes] And Vivian was barely ten years old. -[camera shutter clicks] -[minister] I often speak to her then. And it seems to me that she is really sure that she will get what she wants. One day, I asked her, "What if you don't get what you want?" She said, and I remembered it clearly, "I have patience, Father." [guests chuckle] [minister] And 18 years later, here we are. -[guests applaud] -[camera shutter clicks] [minister] Philip, do you take Vivian as your lawful wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish until death do you part? I do, Father. [minister] Vivian, do you take Philip as your lawful husband, to have and to hold from this day forward for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish until death do you part? -Vivian? -[guests whispering indistinctly] I do not, Father. -[guests gasp] -[woman] What? -[guests whispering indistinctly] -[tense music playing] I want everyone to see this. -[guests gasp] -[indistinct chatter] -[woman 1] This is impossible. -[woman 2] What am I seeing? -[woman 1] This is just impossible! -[Pinky] Oh my god! [woman 3] Oh my god! [indistinct chatter] [woman 2] She's her best friend! How could this be? Now, tell me! How can I marry the man who's cheating on me with my best friend? My fucking maid of honor! Don't you dare touch me! -[Philip] Vivian, not now, please! -[Vivian] You two are freaking liars! -You betrayed me! -It's our wedding day. -We're right inside the church! -You had no right! -There's no more wedding! Fuck you! -[guests gasp] -Stop that! Stop it! -You guys can get married now! -[Shiela groans] -Stop! Stop it! -[guests clamor] -Vivian! Vivian, wait! -Come back. Vivian. -Vivian! Go to hell! [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] -Open the fucking door! -[Philip] Vivian! -[tense music playing] -[car door closes] -Vivian! -[indistinct chatter] -Vivian, stop! Wait! Wait! -[tense music concludes] [sobs] She should be thankful that's all I did to her. [sobs] God knows I've killed her so many times in my head! She should've just stabbed me! [sobs] She should've hit me. Not like this. I know. It's my fault. It's my fault. It's my fault. [chuckles] And nothing's going to change that. I would've slashed her. Strangled her with my fucking Hermes scarf. Damn it! My fucking Hermes scarf! [sobs] Damn! Hermes is expensive! I did not seduce him. It happened once. And I'm not trying to justify it, okay? He wanted it to happen too. Things like this just happen, and when it did… [chuckles] Yes, I know I am not ready. Fuck! [sobs] I can't believe I was just stupid enough to actually believe in that "no sex before the marriage" thing! [gulps] I never touched Vivian. I sometimes wish… [sobs] …he could've just touched me. That's how much I respect her. My best friend had him first. How the hell should I know that she already knew about it? What if I told her, and then she didn't know about it? Her bodyguards might have shot me. [sobs] This is how a man with no future looks like. This is what I get for playing a virgin. I still love him. [sniffles] But I need to leave him. [laughs] And I thought… my wedding would be perfect. [breathes heavily] Vivian will change from head to toe. [sobs, sniffles] I'm done with this. Ouch! [mumbles, exhales] I need to get out of here. [sobs, sniffles] I need to get away. [sobs] I'm going to my honeymoon alone. [upbeat music playing] [indistinct chatter] Good morning, ma'am, I'm just gonna check. Thank you, ma'am. [woman speaking indistinctly over PA] [ticket inspector] Enjoy your flight, ma'am. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] Philippines is all about adventure, you know? [laughs] [upbeat music concludes] You know… you know… you know, the term… [laughs] …the term "you know" was made famous by Manny Pacquiao. -Boxing. -Yeah, Pacquiao. Pacquiao, yeah, yeah. [exhales, sniffs] You know, the Filipinos are really adventurous in terms of… of sports… [hesitates] Um, in terms of, uh… when it comes to life because of the OFWs, and love. [laughs] The hell with love! -Hey, calm down. -[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. -I mean, yeah. -Calm down. I mean, love. Love, love, love. Uh… The heart. [sniffs] Yeah. You know how strong the heart of the Filipinos are in terms of being adventurous, strong, and bravehearted. -Yeah. -We've got strong will. -You know why? -[man] Why? I'll show you why. -[man] All right. -Right now! -You want to see it? -[man] Sure. All right, here we go, all right? Sorry. [gulps] [man] Hey, careful. -[Philip grunts] -[man] Whoa, hey! [water splashes] -[indistinct chatter] -[car horns honking] [Shiela] Hello, Potch. I'm back. What's up? [Potch] Ma'am Shiela, they are still talking about the issue. -[indistinct chatter] -Can you tell them to stop? [Potch] The advertisers are thinking twice in placing ads to our magazine. I've suffered enough already. What do they really want? -Do they want me to kill myself? -[woman speaking indistinctly over PA] -[focus mitts thud] -[grunts] -[indistinct chatter] -[grunts] [jazz music playing] -[woman] Good morning, ma'am. -Morning! -Oh! Good morning, ma'am! -Good morning! [jazz music concludes] -[newspaper thuds softly] -[indistinct chatter] [somber music playing] -He's in the hospital? -[somber music concludes] He has a fracture, so he needs to undergo a surgery. Where? From what I know, it's his left leg. -I mean, the name of the hospital. -I'll look for it. Let's start the meeting. But Mr. Valdez thought you're coming back next month. Let's go! Write whatever's on your minds. Those things you are talking about. I want it on my desk this afternoon. [employees] Yes, ma'am. What can you do if your personal life always interferes with your professional life? That's how life is! -People will always have a say. -Hi. [Ricky] We can't do anything about it! -Welcome back, ma'am. -We're glad you're here. -Sit down. -Thank you. Sorry. I hope I'm not interfering with your personal career, Ricky. -No! That's not what I meant. My point-- -What? That you'll keep me in silence while the issue isn't done yet? -[Ricky] No, no. It's not that. -That's what I heard. The problem is, people won't forget about this. According to history, yes, they may be forgetful. But for intrigues, I don't think so. But if we're going to be lame ducks about this as if we don't have the right to write about anything else in this world, then I'll just leave. No, no! It's not that. It's not like that. Or better yet, you guys leave. Z Magazine can handle this with my own personal life. Wedge right in. My vacation is over. Our cover for this issue is weddings. -Weddings? -Maybe it's better to have-- No! They wanted to get my statement to air my side of the issue. I will not give in to that. I'm not trashy. I'm not hysterical, or maybe I am, but come on, let's do this in style. -Are you with me? -[employees] Yes. Yes, ma'am. -[jazz music playing] -Okay, get back to work. [jazz music concludes] There you go again. You want to hurt yourself again. And tell you, you deserve that. Snake. Is that it? Oh, my. Ma, two days before Philip was supposed to get married, I told him I'm done with it. I was leaving, even though it hurt. So, what's stopping you now? [groans softly] Didn't they give you the bouquet already? Ma! Don't be cruel! I'm just trying to say that you've done something wrong. You weren't forgiven. You were told you are bad. But that was before! Before you were, it is true! But now, you're not. And if you feel that you're both a mess, why don't you clean up! I don't think my conscience can take it. My child, Vivian already left him. They're not married. You love him. It's not that I'm tolerating you, but it is what it is! [clothes thud softly] The question is, does he love me? That's the same mistake I had with your dad. I didn't ask him if he loves me. I just assumed. But I realized he doesn't love me anymore. Y… you know, there's really nothing wrong. But if you feel awkward about it, then don't. He's in the hospital right now. I know. Ma, why are things so simple to you? Yes, it is simple. Because when I leave later, nobody's going to be on your side. [sighs] [soft music playing] Thank you. I just wanted to know if you're okay. [soft music concludes] The doctor fixed my leg. I have a fracture. What did you do? I fell. It was a bad fall. Was it an accident or-- It seems to me that I wanted it to happen. But when it did… [chuckles] …I didn't like it. Ouch. Shiela, I'm sorry. I wanted it. Before and after, I wanted it to happen. I was just telling you how I had the accident. I'm so sorry. My mind run so quickly. It's also my fault, right? Philip. It's the best sin we ever did. [chuckles softly] If that was a sin, we are already suffering from it now. Look at me. People are ashamed of me. And you, look at you. We're in hell right now. But you see, Philip… we are both in hell. Our souls are burning. Can I hold your hand? -[soft music playing] -[Shiela groans softly] [sniffles, sobs] Let me take care of you. Hey, you. Are you trying to start a fight? No. It's just that I'm not used to being the poor one. -[groans] -Go on, you can do it! Thank you so much. [chuckles] I'll go ahead. [door closes] -Dad, please buy me that. I like it. -It matches this one. -There. Joking. -That's expensive. [chuckles] Good afternoon. I'll go ahead. -Talk to her. -Uh, don't go yet. Um, we'll be going in a while. Nobody will look after him. [chuckles softly] -[soft music concludes] -[plane engine rumbling] [upbeat music playing] -Uh, ma'am. -[indistinct chatter] -Yes. Is there a problem? -Uh, none at all. Get used to this. [upbeat music concludes] [crickets chirping] So, how was your trip to Barcelona? Mm… It was good. I had so much fun. But it seemed like there was something missing. Oh, yes, because when it's a honeymoon, you should be a couple, right? -Nestor! -[chuckles] -What? -No, Ma, it's okay. I'm over it. It's less than two months since the… [hesitates] Say it. The scandal. Did you know that we are the ones who faced the press? We are the ones who faced relatives, friends, even our nosy neighbors. -Can we just change the topic? -Ma, it's okay. I'm perfectly fine. We can actually talk about Philip the whole time, till his tongue bleeds. [chuckles] That's my girl! [Vivian] Mm. In fact, I actually know that he was hospitalized. I believe he deserved it. How did you find out? Well, of course, with the power of social network. Oh, yes! Even when she farts, it's on Twitter. [both laugh] -Nestor, that's disgusting! -Oh. But anyway, you gotta see all the amazing stuff I bought there. I got a lot of stuff from Barcelona. You're gonna love it. The container van is full already. -Wh-- What container van? -What stuff? Stuff. Furniture, decorations for my house. [sighs] Vivian… We plan to sell the house. No. Isn't it a gift for me? That was when you were getting married. [sighs] Mom, I love that house. I was the one who designed it. I decided on the materials to be used and which rooms would be next to each other, so I'm gonna live there. Okay? [upbeat music playing] -[Nestor] Mm… -[sighs] [upbeat music concludes] [soft music plays] [Philip] So, here, the table… uh… sofa. Beige, brown, and wood. -Four-piece set. -Mm-hmm. And, uh… Hmm. Chandelier? Yes. But just a small one. It might look like it's a hotel. -[chuckles] -[chuckles, sighs] [birds chirping] -[soft music concludes] -[birds chirping] [soft music playing] [dramatic music playing] Point of no return. [upbeat music playing] Come after me. [chuckles] -Where is she going? -Don't ask, just go! -Let's go! -[guard] Let's go! -[car alarm chirps] -[car engine revs] [crowd cheering] [indistinct chatter] Who's that? Is that… -The devil. -Speaking of the-- I said it already. Hi! Hi! You might have gas pain. -Vivian! -[kisses] -Hello. -[laughs] -Hi. -Gia, you gained some weight. -Hi. -Hi, Liza. Who are these boys? Strapping boys. This is Mark Venecia of Luxon and Associates. -Hello, nice to meet you. -This is Arvin Sanchez, the son of the-- -Well, of course. It's nice to meet you. -Hi. And this is Boggs. -My brother. You've met. -[Boggs] Hi, Vivian. Yes. So, a lawyer, an architect, and a brother. Hmm… -[Boggs] Well… [chuckles] -What happened to you? Mm… Well, I told you, I'm going to change. So, here it is. -She did change. -So, brother, -do you mind dancing with me? -Sure. On the dance floor. Can you hold my bag, please? Mm. And, guys, if you want to join us, don't be afraid. I'm safe. Would you mind? -Is it okay? -Yeah. -Okay. -Yeah. [Arvin] Whoo! -[Pinky] She's so different! -Wow. -The party starts now. -Mm-hmm. [crowd cheering] [chuckles] -So, tell me… -[Vivian laughs] …you're not a virgin anymore? Well, it's been exactly two months and three days. [women laugh] -Where? -[Gia] Where? Well, it happened in Barcelona. Of course, I was sad and lonely at that time. -[Gia] Who is he? -His name is Diego. -Ooh! -[Gia] His name is so tough. [laughs] Imagine me saying, "Diego, Diego! Diego!" -Diego! -Diego! This is good. What's that? Yeah, okay. I'll take it later. -[women cheer] -Ooh! Yeah! -Viv! Viv, Smile! -Uh, ma'am, let's just delete that. We already have an anti-camcorder law. Ooh! Thanks! -Ooh! -Yeah! [Liza] Hey, the one you're babysitting has left already. Hey, where are you now? Ma'am's going out! -Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. -[upbeat music concludes] -Your house is so big. -Well, of course. Manang Belle! -My things. -You are rich. Oh, come on. So, anyway, this is my idea of having fun. What about you? [groaning softly] Now, what? Come join me. [groans softly] Whoo! What's taking you so long? -[grunts] -[Vivian] Hurry up. [chuckles] Whoa! -[exhales, groans] -[Vivian grunts] [dramatic music playing] [both laugh] [smooches] [both grunt] -I know you. -[moans] You're the runaway bride. I didn't run away. -Your story was featured on TV. -Hmm. Keep talking, it hasn't taken effect. [both grunt] So, I am brave. Are you afraid? -Trembling even. -[chuckles softly] -[grunts] -[groans] -So, you're into that. -What do you mean? Domination. Humiliation. That's fine with me. You fucking son of a bitch! -[grunts] -[groans] Call me anything you want, ma'am. [moans] I love you. [groans softly] [smooches] -[grunts] -[Mark groans] I'm sorry, ma'am. It won't happen again. -I'm sorry, Vivian. -[moans] Damn you, Gia. What is this you gave me? [moans] -[grunts] -[moans] [both moaning] [dramatic music concludes] -Good morning, ma'am. -Hmm. -Why is that for two? -Ma'am, the other one's for your guest. [groans softly] Get an insecticide. There's a cockroach on my bed. [Manang] Yes, ma'am. Let's go. I'll just have breakfast in the office. [rock music playing] [indistinct chatter] -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. Yes, good morning. [woman] Good morning, ma'am. Uh, hi, madam. -Welcome back. Good morning. -Good morning. Relax, Thelma. They are just boobs. You also have this. -[men] Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. -[woman 1] Hi, ma'am. Good morning. -Good morning. [rock music concludes] -[woman 2] Welcome, ma'am. -[employees] Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Thank you. Sit down, guys. It's okay. As we all know, my father, Nestor Paredes, retired from this company a few months ago. And I promised myself to continue what he started. But for me to be able to do that, I had to change myself. As you can see, this is the New Vivian Paredes. -The new Vivian Paredes… -[indistinct chatter] …reflects the rebirth of this company as well. And I expect a lot of change from you guys. And we'll start with a new logo. I hope you guys can follow. [soft music playing over speaker] [Vivian] And, guys, once this is all set, we'll have a major campaign launch for this majestic piece of land. [indistinct chatter] As we all see, this will turn into the most advanced city complex in Manila. This is a big project, so I'll be expecting a lot from you guys. I have to make sure that we achieve all our market and target sales in time for RFO, okay? And yes. Please listen to me, guys. I do fire people. You have to remember that. But for now, let's just have fun. -Welcome to Project Vermillion Valley. -[employees cheer] [soft music concludes] [soft music playing] [Philip] The doctor told me I won't be needing the wheelchair and this. Hmm. Maybe we can donate this somewhere? [soft music concludes] And you know what? My boss is really nice. He told me that I can go back to work next week. Hey, what is it? I'm just happy because you'll be able to walk again. I can't see that. [chuckles] [Shiela groans softly] You know what? When you were getting married… I told myself I've had enough. And that I'm leaving you. I just have to let you go. But if your wedding did happen, I wouldn't settle to being your mistress. You guys won't see me anymore. Only a miracle can change things. [cup thuds] I can't believe that this miracle is actually happening. I so much wanted to show you how much love I can give. To be the one you will marry. But now that you're okay, -I guess, I have to… -[groans] -[groans] Shiela. -[soft music playing] Just like what you said… there's only two of us in hell. [chuckles softly] I know that you were traumatized by weddings. -[sobs] But I hope someday-- -Shiela, I was traumatized by the scandal. -[soft music concludes] -Not weddings. -[groans] -[Shiela groans] Philip! Take it slow. [both groan] [soft music playing] [smooches] [breathes heavily] [soft music concludes] You're weird. You're the one who gives flowers to guys. -[indistinct chatter] -Weird? Not when you're in love. [grunts] You mean to say… -Hmm? -[whimpers] We both are! And why? [sighs] Because I feel like I love Philip more than he loves me. Even if he promised me that he'll marry me. [groans] Still I feel like I'm only second to his priorities. Come on! You know what? I think you're just having this wrong thought. Hmm. But come to think of it, mm… the three of you didn't have any closure. [gloomy music playing] [gloomy music concludes] -[indistinct chatter] -Mm-hmm. Just in time for the opening of the exhibit. -[telephone ringing in distance] -Mm, yup. Sure. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Bye. -When is this? -They faxed that last week. They said they're coming over for a meeting. And I approved this? Yes, you told me to schedule the proposals today. I thought-- -Wait, does Valdez know about this? -Hmm? Ricky, did anyone talk to you about this? Well, I thought you knew that it's a Paredes project? No. Well, you don't have to say yes. [Shiela] Why did I only find out about this today? -Ma'am, they're here. -Who are they? [dramatic music playing] Hi, Shiela. [dramatic music concludes] Well, we all know that Z Magazine is on top of its game right now. And we need your help. We need your help because we're coming up with a major campaign launch. -And I was hoping-- -How do you want Z to be a part of this? Well, we want Z to have our own section there. All about Vermillion Valley. Let's say ten pages, uh, inserted in every month's issue, and, of course, showcasing your own designs, texts, and everything. What I'm trying to say is like a small magazine inside. So, I was thinking that if I was reading about weddings, when I flip the page, I was hoping that I could see Vermillion Valley. Or when I read about food, politics, or golf even, when I flip the page again, then I'll see Vermillion Valley. So… here's the whole project. I want you guys to look into it. It's still a rough draft, but I trust you guys to create a spin. Okay. Um, we'll take it up and we'll get back to you. Hmm. Okay. [groans softly] Thank you so much for your time. Um… um, Viv. Uh… um, can we talk? -Uh, if you'll excuse us. -[man] Okay, ma'am. -[Ricky] Okay, gotta go. -Okay. -Why? Why all these? -[chuckles] Mm, nothing. Peace offering. [groans softly] I guess, you're still mad at me. No, um… -I think I should be the one apologizing-- -Don't. Don't bother anymore. I've forgiven you for everything that happened. Uh, the truth is I wanted to surprise you. But I can see you're still afraid of me. [soft music playing] I'm sorry if I stressed you out real bad. [chuckles softly] Uh, that's why I was thinking… maybe we can do the usual? [chuckles softly] The usual. [both chuckle] After that, I realized that I've hurt myself. Well, I realized that what I should change is how I view the world. And then that's it. That's what I did. I went out more often, made a lot of friends, and I definitely met a lot of men. [chuckles] You know, there's no need for emotions involved. -That's not really important now. -[soft music concludes] My biggest regret is… our friendship. Since high school, through college… Why didn't you tell me you like Philip? Vivian, you are my friend. Even though I like Philip, I had to take a backseat because you like him. And I know that he likes you too. Perhaps if you told me that before… I would have given him to you. [sighs] -Wow! Nice bag. -[chuckles softly] Maybe we can meet up again? Uh… [chuckles] Shiela, let's take it slowly. I… I think that it's best that Philip doesn't find out that we are seeing each other if that's okay with you. [grunts softly] I understand. Mm. For now, we're business partners, and we're friends. -Hmm? -Hmm. [both laugh] -[indistinct chatter] -So, that's it? She didn't slap you. That's why you guys reconciled. -[cutlery clinking] -She already moved on. In fact, she doesn't even want to see Philip! [scoffs] You know what? I'm not a devil who'll put bad thoughts in your head, but, girl-- Or maybe you're the one who's jealous, because Vivian and I might turn into best friends again. Hmm? [gulps] Hey! I have no issues. Hey, queen. I am loyal. Hmm. Do you want the truth? Huh? You betrayed Vivian. If I were Vivian, you'd have an indefinite TRO. -Please don't be like that. [sighs] -Well… We're working together. I have a project with her. Well, maybe I'm just too suspicious, and that's why they disappear so easily from my life. [scoffs] My god! -You mean the flowers! -Mm-hmm. -[Shiela sighs] -They've already withered. -[sighs] -[reflective music plays] -Yeah. Okay. -We already visualized the interiors of the units. -[Vivian] Yes! This looks great! -[Shiela] Is it okay? Well, I like it farther. After that, we had a dinner date, and then… -[cellphone ringing] -…he wanted to watch a movie. But I didn't want to, so we just went to his place. I don't know what's wrong with me! I felt so helpless! Even though I was so exhausted. And you know what? After that, uh… So, as you know, this brand really carries the heritage in Europe for being one of the best brands. -Hi! [giggles] Hold on. -[chuckles] -I have one. -So, where are we going now? Where? Just come with me! -[Shiela] Wait! Look. That's so pretty! -[Vivian] No. -Why? Isn't that pretty? -I don't like it. -Shall we go to sleep? -Give me a minute. [uplifting music concludes] -[upbeat music playing] -[indistinct chatter] [both giggle] [both laugh] -[upbeat music concludes] -Here's the final draft. [soft music playing] [soft music concludes] [uplifting music playing] There's the pool, the other amenities, then next, please. That's the spread of magazines on the penthouse suites with captions at the bottom. -[uplifting music concludes] -[upbeat music playing] [indistinct chatter] -[scoffs] You'll be fine. -Vivian, can we do this next time? Come! Come! Come! -Two shots of tequila. -It's awkward! I'll take care of you. Don't worry. I got this. -[chuckles] -Thank you, sir. -Shiela! Hi. -[laughs, gasps] -Oh. Gia! -[kisses] -Shiela! -[Shiela] Pinky, nice to see you again. -[kisses] -Hey. -[shrieks] -[Shiela] Iza, right? See? You know nothing's permanent in this world. Enemies, friends, it just goes around. -[Iza] Welcome back to the coven. -[Gia] Oh. Meeting of the witches! -Prepare yourself. -Here. [Gia] We're gonna get wasted. [women] Cheers! -[chuckles] -[gulps] -[crowd cheers] -[women] Cheers! -I said take it off! [grunts] -Huh? -[women squeal] -Now, unbutton your shirt. [breathes heavily] -[cheers] -[women] Take it off! Take it off! -[gasps] -[women squeal] -[giggles] -[women laugh] -Alice in Wonderland time. -You will have X-ray vision. -Mm-hmm. -Why not? -Yes! Whoo! -[laughs] [giggles] -Whoo! Go, Shiela! -[women cheer] -[laughs] -[woman] Yeah! -[Shiela giggles] -[laughs] [crowd cheers] -[man] …with you all night. -That's what I'm talking about! [crowd cheers] -I think you're so sexy. -[Shiela giggles] -[woman] All right! -[man] There you go! -[groans] -Are you okay? -Sorry! S-- Sorry! -You okay? -[crowd cheers] -Bye! -Bye, girls! -[women] Bye! -Enjoy! -Whoo! -Oh, my gosh! -Whoo! -Cheers to that! -[crowd cheers] [upbeat music concludes] [Shiela groans] -[whimsical music playing] -[gasps] [whimsical music concludes] [cellphone ringing] Hello? Hello, Vivian, what happened? What happened to you? You suddenly disappeared last night. Where are you? I'm on my way home. That guy, he… Oh my god! Don't tell me, you're just on your way home now? -My god! My god! -[gasps] Did you… did you just do it with that guy? [chuckles] What's his name again? [Shiela] I have no idea. Vivian, please, I'm not comfortable having this! Uh, it's okay, it's okay. It'll be our little secret. -I feel so guilty. -Guilty? [tense music playing] Oh, with Philip? Well, does he really have to know? -[Shiela] All right, I have to go. -Hmm. -Hmm. -[cellphone thuds] [tense music concludes] Dude, I'll just have lunch out. -All right, take care. -[uplifting music playing] [man] Uh, yes, sir. Sir, ma'am, if you need anything, just ask Matteo. [indistinct chatter] Sure, it's a Lamborghini. [indistinct chatter] [uplifting music concludes] [whimsical music playing] I'm looking for this particular makeup store, -and I think it's right there. -[Bruno] Okay, ma'am. -Just have my other stuff picked up later. -[Bruno] Yes, ma'am. [whimsical music concludes] -[dramatic music playing] -Are you stalking me? -Hmm. -[dramatic music concludes] -[indistinct chatter] -[cutlery clinking] [groans softly] I just wanted to tell you that I deserve everything that happened. -And whatever I do-- -How are you? [chuckles softly] So, you really aren't married? [exhales] No. [chuckles softly] Put that down. [giggles] I'm scared. Of what? Really… really, I was really scared after what happened. -I thought your dad will have me killed. -[chuckles] What do you think of us? Well, you are rich. -You can have me-- -We're rich, but we're not a yakuza. And come on, over a wedding? You think I'd do something like that? If I really wanted to kill you, I should have done that way back. I should have not humiliated you. [somber music playing] Which… by the way, I know I've hurt so many people because of that. You mean Shiela? Yeah. So, how's Shiela? Uh, well… [chuckles softly] …we're sort of… -Good. That's good. -[glass thuds] I'm happy for you guys. [chuckles] Do you want to see her? Uh, I can't think about… [sighs] Not for now, I guess. I think it's best that we're able to talk first, right? Well, if you don’t mind… mm, can I get your number? [somber music concludes] [soft music playing] -Morning. -[Bruno] Morning. [soft music concludes] [tense music playing] [tense music concludes] [soft music playing] Is this new? [Shiela] Mm-hmm. Paredes? -Huh? -[soft music concludes] Here. Your magazine has a long feature of the Paredes land. Yeah. What "Yeah"? You mean you got a sponsorship from them? Um, business. How? Did you see each other? -Who? -What "Who"? Uh, no. It was just her marketing staff. They told me Vivian doesn't have to be there. Why? Nothing. I thought… you've already seen each other. I've been thinking… if we're getting married… why not sooner? [soft music playing] Are you proposing to me? I think so. [chuckles] I'm the one proposing to you. Will you marry me? Can we have this without any public announcement? And don't put a feature of it on your magazine. -[chuckles] Hmm. -[chuckles] You took my job. [soft music concludes] -[indistinct chatter] -Let's go. -What are we doing here? -You said you saw them here. Come on! But as if they'll meet the same time again here. [Shiela] You're telling me this now! [Mike] I don't want you to be stressed out. -[Shiela] They're dead. -[scoffs] None. They're not here. Let's go. My feet are killing me! -Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! -Wait! Just wait! -Wait! -Let's go. Come on. This is so irritating! All right. Why don't you just call Philip or Vivian? Hurry. -Call them. -[clicks tongue] [screen tapping] [automated voice] The subscriber cannot be reached. Please try again later. -[cellphone beeps] -I can't reach them. -[sighs] They might be together. -Let's go. Please. -[gasps] -They might be here somewhere. -There he is. There. -Where? -There's her bodyguard. -[Shiela] Where? -Are you flirting with him? -It's hard to explain. [rock music playing] [gasps] Come! Let's go! Hurry! Come. She's already here. Maybe that tramp came in earlier. -[groans] -Oh, damn! -Sorry. -[rock music concludes] -Wait. -Sorry. -Shiela, right? -[playful music playing] Haven't heard from you? -Greg. It's Greg. -Greg? Shake hands? -Hi. Hello. [chuckles] -[Greg] Hi. How are you? Shiela! -Oh my god, she's here. -Hi! -Hey, you. [kisses] -Hi. Where have you been? I'm here shopping. Do you want to come with me? [chuckles] Vivian, what a surprise. -[Vivian] Likewise. -[chuckles] Um, we just had coffee. -Yeah. -Hi, I'm Mike. -Hi. Very nice to meet you. -Yeah. Hi. -Hi. -Uh… you know what, you look familiar. Oh, sorry. I'm Greg. Greg. Nice to meet you. Hello. Oh, Greg! That Greg. Oh. Hmm. Yes. Um, you know what, I'm gonna buy some new shoes and some stuff. Are you sure, you don't want to come with me? [soft music playing] -How about you? -Oh! Actually, we're going to… we're going to… where is that? We're going to Z, right? -Yeah. We're going to Z. -Yup. Okay. Well, just call me if you need anything. -All right, bye. -[kisses] -Nice to meet you! -Bye! -Yeah, bye. -Bye. -You? -Mike, let's go! -Bye, Vivian. Bye! -Huh? Yeah, okay. Bye! -[Vivian] Bye. -Let's go! -[Greg] Bye. -[sighs] Hmm. [soft music concludes] -Damn her! -Hey, stop. She planned all of these. I'll get back at her. She'll see. -[indistinct chatter] -[soft music playing] -Here. -Thank you. [exhales] -Where are we going? -Uh, you'll see. I know you will like it. -I can't stay long, okay? -Hmm? Sure. [birds chirping] I remember you wanted it beige and brown. Wood-inspired. [chuckles] Yeah. [chuckles] So, wanna check out the pool? -Sure. -Hmm. Remember you wanted it in blue tiles? -It's beautiful. -Hmm. You haven't seen the rest of it yet. Come. And this is the terrace leading to the bedroom. Exactly how we planned it. Come on. -[soft music concludes] -This is the master's bedroom. Do you remember this bed? [grunts softly] So, you bought this as well. I thought it's gone. This is last piece. -Actually, it's beautiful. -[tense music playing] It follows the form of your body when you lay down. [grunts softly] [sighs] Hmm. [sniffles] Philip. [chuckles softly] Everything went miserable after what happened. [sobs] I asked myself, "Why didn't I push the wedding through even if I knew about it?" [chuckles] At first, I wanted to hurt you. But when I saw you at the mall… [sighs] …everything came back. This house… it was built by our dream. [chuckles softly] The house is the only thing that came true. [sobs, sniffles] [sobs] [smooches] [smooches] -[soft music concludes] -["Even If" playing] ♪ Even if ♪ ♪ You mean the whole damn world to me ♪ -♪ I can forget you, wait and see ♪ -♪ Wait and see ♪ ♪ I can be strong ♪ -♪ Even without you ♪ -♪ Even without you ♪ ♪ I can't waste my life forever ♪ ♪ Hoping you'd come back to me ♪ ♪ But deep inside, I know ♪ ♪ I'll be waiting here for you ♪ [song concludes] [indistinct chatter] Who's that for?

[groans softly] [sighs] -I want you to come with me. -[sighs heavily] Philip, I cannot face Vivian by myself. So, please come with me. Do you think I can face her? Then, if she won't talk to you, we'll just talk to each other. [both chuckle] You really are something. -[jazz music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -[woman] Oh, hi, Viv. You look fabulous. -Hi. Hello. [kisses] -Hello. Nice to meet you. -Hi. -Hello. Hi. -[camera shutter clicks] -Hi. Hello. -Hello. -[man] Hi. -Hi. -Mom. -[Josephine] Hi, Viv. [Mike] Hi, Bruno. -Oh, really? -Mom. Mom! -Hi, there. [kisses] -[kisses] -[Josephine] You look so good. -Thank you. -Hey, your shirt looks good on you. -Thank you. -Of course. [laughs] -Cheers! Ladies and gentlemen, the new CEO of the Paredes Group of Companies. Please welcome Miss Vivian Paredes. [guests cheer and applaud] [music concludes] -[camera shutter clicks] -Good evening, everyone. Well, this dream started when my father, Nestor Paredes, imagined a city that rises facing a setting sun… -[cheering and applause] -…overlooking a valley. [chuckles] He said he wanted a city that people would actually want to stay there for generations. Not just buildings, not just high-tech gadgets, but a city that is home to the love and the sharing of all our joys. -[indistinct chatter] -And this is something -that we don't just pay for. -[tense music playing] -[chuckles] Something that is priceless. -[camera shutter clicks] -Friends. -[tense music concludes] Welcome to the beginning of the fulfillment of that dream. [guests cheer] [uplifting music playing over speaker] [guests applaud] [indistinct chatter] [camera shutter clicks] -Hey, you. [kisses] -[kisses] Hey. [kisses] -[dramatic music playing] -Hmm. -Well, thank you for coming. -[camera shutter clicks] I screwed up my courage, bringing Philip here. [camera shutter clicks] Hello. Well, hi, Philip. I think you gained some weight. By the way, Vivian, I'm so proud and happy for you. You finally pulled it off. Well, without the help of Z, I don't think I'd be able to. My pleasure. And on that note, I have an announcement to make. Ladies and gentlemen… we're engaged. [guests gasp, whisper] Oh my god. We'll be getting married a month from now. Right, Philip? Well, I can definitely say that you and Philip deserve each other. And one more thing, will you be willing to be my maid of honor? Shiela, I told you, no public announcement. -I'd love that. -Thank you. [dramatic music concludes] So now what? Will I be the last one to know that I gave you an engagement ring? Here you go! [groans] [chuckles] Wow. Wow! Philip. This is all so sudden! But, of course, I'll marry you. Now, are we okay? Didn't I tell you, no public announcements? Philip, tell me the truth. Are you and Vivian seeing each other? -What? -[tense music playing] Are you dating? Do you go to her house? What? -[indistinct chatter] -Dude, bad shot. Are you letting things work like a car? You're just going to drive it like a car without brakes. Then you'll be doing nothing. So that in the end, you won't be the one to blame. I was just thinking that when she becomes my wife, all of this would end. I'll close all the doors, windows, and I won't love anyone else. Do you love her? -[billiard balls clacking] -[sighs] [scoffs] Try to fix your life. -[dramatic music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -[Philip] How are you, pastor? -[minister] I'm happy for my best friend. It's true, pastor. I couldn't sleep last night. -Philip. Best wishes on your wedding. -Thank you for coming. -[woman] Shiela, congratulations. -[Shiela] Hi. -Thank you for coming. -[man] Thank you. -Thank you! [chuckles] -Oh. Thank you. -[dramatic music concludes] -[upbeat music playing] -She's here. -Hi. -Hi! -[Shiela] Hi, Viv. I'm here. Oh. Oh, I hope you don't mind. I invited another guest. -Who? -Uh… Hello, Shiela. Congratulations. [upbeat music concludes] Philip, do you take Shiela as your lawful wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish until death do you part? [guests whispering] -I'm sorry, but I can't. -[guests gasp] -Again? Huh? -Oh. Moment of truth. -You're evil! [groans] -[Vivian] That's what you deserve! -That's a slap in your face! -[guests clamor] Or do you want me to say it in English, you snake? -You threw him away like a piece of trash! -You're the trash! I can smell you from here. You're rotten and you're filthy! Kill her! -Stop it! -I said kill her! -No. Wait. -No! Both of you. Just stop it! No. No. Philip. Listen to me, please. -I want you back. -[Mike] Sorry! Sorry! [indistinct chatter] Why do you want him back? After taking care of him? Well, your job is done here, Shiela! I can have him back. -You're a monster! -Well, you made me one, anaconda. Weren't you content when you abandoned us? [groans] Philip, Its just her. It doesn't include you. It was a big mistake that I didn't push the wedding through. But now, I know what I want. I'm sure. -I love you so much, Philip. -Bitch! You've ruined my life before. Now, you're ruining it again! Will you let us be? -Well, even if he cheated on you? -[dramatic music playing] He just wanted a one-night stand. Philip loves me. That's not what I meant. What I'm talking about is that you cheated on Philip! Oh, yes. She cheated on you over this guy. -Philip! Philip! Philip! Stop it! -[Greg groans] -[men clamor] -[man] Stop it! -[Philip] Get your hands off me! -Stop it! Stop it! [breathes heavily] You know, I've had enough of the both of you! -Philip, I was just drunk that time. -Yeah right. It wasn't the true story, Philip. [sobs] Oh! Do you want Greg to describe how good you were in bed? -That's enough! -[groans] Philip, after this, everything will be okay. I promise you. Philip, me. It was me who helped you get back on track. I took care of you! -I said, that's enough! -[groans] Why are you fighting over someone stupid like me? Huh? All of this lying. All of this deceit. Just stop. Not me. You don't deserve me. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! That's how you made me feel! Or maybe even to others! You know what? I loved both of you. But what did you do? You made me look like a fool! You only loved yourselves! [sobs] -Philip, Philip, me. -No. No. Me. -Me too. I'm willing to change for you. -None! Not one of you! [Matteo] Let's go. They're just fooling you around. -[Philip] You guys should be together! -[dramatic music concludes] [Ricky] This is just too much. You're so brave. You scolded at your boss. I was just protecting her from herself. -Good answer. -Mm-hmm. Look. They are staring at each other. Looks like there's going to be an even bigger fight. [Mike] Oh, my. Let them be. Let's go. Good answer. Let them be. -You whore! [grunts] -[groans] -It's all your fault! -[groans] -You made me one. -[dramatic music playing] Happy now? Burikak! -What the fuck is "burikak"? -Then google it! -You son of a bitch! -[groans] You should be thankful I was able to stand you, because nobody wanted to be your friend in high school because you have bad breath! -[grunts, groans] -[groans] [Shiela] You! Your breath is not the only thing stinks! -[groans] -[Shiela] You're arrogant! [grunts] You only got rich because of your dad. I worked hard for my money. Do you understand? You're envious! Even when we were in high school! -[Shiela groans] -You're always envious of me! -Sorry, but I have everything! -[groans] -You're so greedy. You greedy bitch! -I'm not greedy. -You're just really poor! [groans] -[Shiela groans] I'm not envious! I'm just smarter than you! -[screams] -[grunts] -You bitch! Philip is mine! -[groans] He's mine! [both grunt, groan] -Give Philip back to me! -[groans] -He's mine! -He just used you! -[groans] -[groans] You're ugly! You're so ugly! You have a mole in your butt! [both grunt, groan] -And you! Where's your mole, huh? -[groans] In the upper left of your groin! Of your dark groin! -My groin isn't dark! [grunts] -[groans] -You can ask Philip! -[screams, groans] You just got your fair skin because of glutathione! [both groan] -You're so ugly! [groans] -[grunts] -[Shiela] You're uglier! [screams] -Fuck you! -Fuck you! You're evil! [groans] -[groans] -[Shiela whimpers, pants] -[pants] [dramatic music concludes] [laughs] -[whimpers, laughs] -[laughs] How did you know that I have a mole in my groin? [both laugh] -Did you have it removed already? -Not yet. [both laugh] -[laughs, sobs] -[sobs] [both panting] Ouch. All of these… [sniffles] …just for one guy. -[soft music playing] -[chuckles] -Come to think of it… -[Shiela pants] [chuckles] …we're, like, crazy. [both laugh] [exhales sharply, pants] [both groan, pant] -Come on. Come on. -[Shiela groans] [laughs] -Look at you. -You too. I'm so filthy. [laughs] -[soft music concludes] -[birds chirping] What really are your plans with your life? The real question is… why did I end up like this? Was I a bad daughter? -What? -[book thuds softly] I was just thinking… maybe that's why I'm like this. It's because you guys spoiled me. [scoffs] And at what soap opera did you get that? [groans softly] I don't know. I'm just… [sighs] Maybe that's the reason why I'm so vengeful. I had to get everything through lying. [scoffs] Maybe because you guys spoiled me. Are you blaming me? No, I was just thinking that's why maybe I'm a mess. Don't you ever dump your mess on my doorstep! Of course, we spoiled you. Because you're our only daughter. What do you expect? I didn't know you're going to be like that. Why? There are so many children out there who were spoiled by their parents. But did they end up being psychotic, dysfunctional, bipolar? Damn you! You're the top honcho of the biggest real estate company -in this country! [breathes heavily] -[sobs] You have your own car. Your own house! Then you'll blame me because you couldn't marry the man who cheated on you. Why? Are you the only who has a problem like that in this world? [breathes heavily] Your father has a 25-year-old mistress. -[gasps] -[Josephine whimpers] -What? -[sobs] Did you hear anything from me? Did I get you involved? [exhales] Well, the hell I care. [scoffs] But it doesn't mean that I don't love your father anymore. On the contrary… the only thing I did… was let him do it. [sobs] And it looks like… your dad is very happy with that arrangement. [sobs] I'm sorry, Ma. I had no idea. [sobs] I'm old. I can't do the things you can. -You're so melodramatic. -[sobs] Can you please be responsible with your own actions? -[Vivian whimpers] -Okay? Hmm. [sniffles, sobs] -Hello, Ma. -[Baby] Hello, where are you? Here in the office. [Baby] That's good. You know, you really need to keep busy so that you can forget about what happened. Ma, I don't know what to do. It's really hard. [sobs] [Baby] Shiela, move on. That's enough. I really can't let it go. [Baby] It's over. Stop it. Don't be a fool! -Maybe I really am a fool. -[soft music playing] [sobs softly, sniffles] [sobs] [soft music concludes] -[indistinct chatter] -After all of these, uh, I mean, what if Philip chose me? Hmm. Why? Will you still go after him? Hmm? I don't know. Hmm. When you do that, and you guys get back together, I'll kill myself first. [groans softly] -Then? -Then back to work. -[chuckles] You'll be dead by then, silly. -[chuckles] Ah, yes. -[chuckles] Um. -[chuckles] -What about Greg? -What about him? -What? -Was he good? [chuckles softly] Honestly… -very good! [chuckles] -[laughs] -Oh my god! So, you can remember. -Every fucking minute! -[soft music playing] -[both laugh] Oh my god! [both laugh] Oh my god. I can just imagine. -Mm-hmm. [laughs] -[laughs] -[soft music concludes] -[uplifting music playing] May God, the eternal Father, keep you in love with each other so that the peace of Christ may stay with you and always be in your home. May your forthcoming children bless you… -Mm. [chuckles] -[minister] …your friends console you… -[both laugh] -[minister] …and your loved ones -live in peace with you. -[shushes] [minister] May your union be filled with love… -Our friend is getting married. -…with God at the center of it all. Please rise. -And may the Almighty God bless you. -[both laugh] -[minister] In the name of the Father… -Where are you going? [minister] …and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen. -[both laugh] -[minister] Brothers and sisters, -I now present to you… -[both laugh] -[minister] …Mr. and Mrs. Legarda. -[both laugh] [minister] You may now kiss the bride. [guests cheer, applaud] -[uplifting music concludes] -[soft music playing] Where are they? I have something to say, but I don't want to. I know what it is. -[Vivian] What? -[chuckles] -Philip is still so cute. -He's still cute, right? -Who did he choose? -Yeah. -After two years. -Who will he choose between the two of us? -Hello! -Do you really want to know? -Um… Hmm. -[soft music concludes] -Hon. -[chuckles softly] -By the way… -Hi. …this is Jovy Albino, my wife. -Hi. -Hi. [Philip] This is Vivian Paredes and Shiela Montes. -Hello. -Hi, nice to meet you. -So, it's you Philip's been talking about. -They're fun people. [chuckles] -Hmm. [laughs] -[chuckles] [chuckles] All right. I'll see you at the reception. -[Shiela] Nice meeting you. -Let's go? Let's go. -Don't you dare comment. -[scoffs] I won't say anything. -I know you! [chuckles] -[chuckles] -Oh, there's my husband. -[upbeat music playing] -Hi. [kisses] -Hi. Hello. [kisses] Don't I get a kiss too? Just joking. -[chuckles] -Stop it! -See you. -Buh-bye. -[indistinct chatter] -[upbeat music concludes] -[soft music playing] -[sighs] [guests cheering] [Vivian] Thank you. [Vivian sighs] Weddings are so overrated. How about you, Bruno? Any plans of getting married? -[Bruno] Ma'am, I'm gay. -[Vivian] Huh? Why didn't you tell me? -I could've asked someone to date you. -[Bruno chuckles] Ma'am… -[Vivian] Do you know Shiela's friend? -[Bruno] Yup, I know him, ma'am. -[chuckles] -[Vivian] How do you know? -[Bruno] Secret! -["Even If" playing] ♪ All those sleepless nights All the tears I cried ♪ ♪ All the pain I kept inside ♪ ♪ I kept asking myself why ♪ ♪ You had to say goodbye ♪ ♪ Was it just a dream When you said to me ♪ ♪ That there is someone New in your life? ♪ ♪ You could have at least lied ♪ ♪ The truth just scared me ♪ ♪ Even if ♪ ♪ You mean the whole damn world to me ♪ -♪ I can forget you, wait and see ♪ -♪ Wait and see ♪ ♪ I can be strong even without you ♪ ♪ Even without you ♪ ♪ I can't waste my life forever ♪ ♪ Hoping you'd come back to me ♪ ♪ But deep inside, I know ♪ ♪ I'll be waiting here for you ♪ ♪ I can't waste my life forever ♪ ♪ Hoping you'd come back to me ♪ ♪ But deep inside, I know ♪ ♪ I'll be waiting here for you ♪ ♪ Waiting for you ♪ ♪ I'll be waiting here for you ♪ [song fades]
