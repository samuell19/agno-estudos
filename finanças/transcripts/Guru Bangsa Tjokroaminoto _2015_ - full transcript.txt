This film tells the story about a pioneer of national ideas in the early 20th century. That time, Indonesia was known as East Indies or Dutch East Indies. The main characters in this movie are based on true events, and some other characters are adapted from several sources at that time. KALISOSOK PRISON, SURABAYA, 1921 I am Cecilius Van Dijk, Dutch East Indies' police officer. I want to get a confession from Mr. Tjokro based on the collected evidence of the riots in Garut City, West Java. We have found the evidence that you, Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto, leader of the Bumiputera community, Islamic Union, did not only falsely testify, but is also the mastermind behind the riots. Please, Mr. Tjokro. Please be polite. Turn around and get close to the table. I'll do it by myself. Isn't my arrival here of my own volition? If it's not for my own will, then your soldier wouldn't be able to defeat the people. I don't want violence before my eyes. Are you able to commit violence, Mr. Tjokro? I am Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto. A Bumiputera Muslim. The leader of Islamic Union that has two million members, the largest community in East Indies. Understands the laws of God. I'm the first Javanese to be the member of Volksraad. OSVIA graduate. My grandfather, Tjokronegoro I had served as the regent of Ponorogo. My grandfather from the other side, Kyai Kasan Besari, was a famous kyai who taught me the value of life as a Javanese. PONOROGO, EAST JAVA, 1895 Damn! What are you doing? Do you know how much it costs? Get away. Get away! We bought your grandfather as an expensive slave from the slave market in Batavia. The best rubber tapper slave. Now you, you sluggard! Recently, the Dutch East Indies empire became the number two rubber exporter in the world. Now, because of a stupid slacker like you, the empire's economy withdrew. Hurry up. Start walking. Look at the prints your dirty paws leave behind. Do you think I wanted to come to this country? In this country, we are failures! We are outcasts! For years, I haven't felt the cold of snow. And now? Your cursed sun is burning me! Work hard, send rubber, sugar, and various coffees to the political authorities who just sit on their asses, relaxing in the empire, in the cafes, who are just good at talking! Never getting bitten by mosquitos! Mosquitos! -Aim for the nose! The nose! -Stop it! -The nose! -Stop! -The nose! -Why do you need those books? -The nose! -Stop! Tjokro. Back to your place. This is Europe. And here is the Netherlands. This part is the Central Asia. Here is Australia. And this is the Dutch East Indies. The Earth feels cramped with the presence of the steamboat and the opening of the Suez Canal. Now that you can travel faster from Asia to Europe, what do you think will happen? Who knows what will happen? -Who knows? -I know what will happen, ma'am. Europeans will come to look for what they don't have. -Rubber, coffee, -Shut your mouth! nutmeg, cloves and tobacco for their factories. -They also look for ports -Shut up! to take away our resources. Europeans here only become kings for a day. You talk too much. -Mr. Jansen who lives behind the school -Shut your mouth! has very long arms, -and instructs people casually. -Shut your mouth! He has 320 maids. 320 people! Tjokro, remember. Important words from the Prophet Muhammad. Hegira. To move from a bad place to a better place. Be like this lamp. Get people to look for the bright path. The second word from the Prophet that you have to remember, Iqra. Read. Read. Tonight, Mr. Tjokroamiseno is holding a ceremony, inviting Wayang Beber Tawangalun, to purify his son who was born along with the eruption of Mount Krakatoa. Hopefully, with this ceremony, Tjokroaminoto will become a great leader. PONOROGO, EAST JAVA, 1904 The bride is passing through! All right! PONOROGO, EAST JAVA, 1905 RUBBER EXPORT FROM PONOROGO, 345 TONS Stop! I've told you many times. Wear gloves. Hold it! Do not let go. Hold it, so the bacteria in your hands die. I've told you many times, but it never gets through to your stupid little brains. Stop working! Stop! Listen closely, everybody. Your hands... Your hands are full with infectious diseases. What if we get sick? What can all of you do? Understand? Stupid. You're like monkeys. And that is why I am here. I want everybody to listen carefully. Every rule that... Stop what you're doing. Stop typing! Shameless bastard. Like I said, for every rule violated, you will get a punishment. What do you want? What do you want? Sit down, please. What? Sit. This tea is hot. But my hands are also used to the heat from the sun. This tea was planted in their soil, with their hard work. You enjoy this tea every morning and afternoon. For the welfare of your country. Fire Tjokroaminoto! Work! Tjokro! Tjokro! Do you really want to quit your job? If that's true, get out of this house. This is about honor. Kings in Java have lost their powers. There's no more absolute power. The absolute power is already in the hands of Dutch East Indies' government. Our family was given a good position. Land. I've told you, a house is not just a residence. It's not just a house, but a position, where we keep our dignity. And now, you've destroyed that dignity. Do you understand? Stupid. Stupid! Where are you going? I've always told you about those blood that dripped on the cotton. You are also probably getting tired of seeing it. I don't know. Where should I bring these voices? The word "Hegira" always rings in my ears. Every time. That makes me feel uneasy. I get it. Because that's what you always talked about since we first met. If migrating is the only way to stop blood and tears that is always calling to you, I'll wait. I'll follow you from behind. This isn't just for us. But also for this baby. This is clearly not appropriate. Where's that guy's responsibility as a husband? All he can do is travel here and there. What does he do out there? What? What? How about this? What a pity, to have this child. If that doesn't come back even after you give birth, don't say he loves you. And don't say that he respects the Mangoensumo family. Don't ever say it. Do you hear what I said? Do you hear? Father. It was you and mother who married me to a guy I didn't know. With Tjokro. I obeyed. Now you both want me to divorce him. I can only be silent. Henceforth, for my whole life, I will never remarry. Because my only husband is Tjokroaminoto. In this world and hereafter. In this world and hereafter. Your words were smooth, my dear. But it pierced my heart. To heaven you'll follow him, to hell you'll also go. Your husband is running away from reality! Bullshit! No, dear. Don't cry. Do you know what batik means? Batik means in the name of God, period. Why? Because human is too small in this ever-changing universe. We have to move following nature's movement. Because we're just actors. Actors of life. After the Javanese kings were defeated, the regents only lived by tributes and public taxes. From the Dutch East Indies Government. Should I give up? Does it have to be like this? Even though your father is a regent, he's different from the other regents. The other regents are willing to be ordered around by the Dutch East Indies. They do whatever they're ordered to. But your father is different, he is not like that. Your father has his own way to protect the commoners. Mr. Tjokro, the news about your resistance against the Dutch overseer has spread. SEMARANG, CENTRAL JAVA, 1905 Right now, we are like scattered sticks of a broom. Like when Arab was ruled by the British. We need to go on a hegira to find the land of hope. To find a leader. Look. Look at these workers. They are like worker ants who have lost their ways. Since Prince Diponegoro, for more than 70 years, we have lost it. We don't have a leader. The Medan Prijaji newspaper by Tirto Adhi Soerjo reported that All-India Muslim League has just been established by Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Dakar. Islam is spreading. Islam is looking for new lands. There's one word that has spread among the people. Satyagraha by Gandhi. That was the real hegira. -How many days has it been? -It's been four days, sir. Four days. Hey! Hey! Ouch. Mr. Tjokro. Me and my friends in Manikem House think that East Indies is a fertile land for Islam. Very fertile. Sunan Kalijaga once said, "Thrives like green rice." And we are looking for future leaders. I just want an answer for my concern. That's the reason I came to Semarang. Mr. Tjokro. I recommend you to go to Surabaya. Surabaya? Yes. Surabaya is the center of the Manikem House. There, my friends will help you. That place is a gate to hegira, Mr. Tjokro. Go there. Then, you will find your hegira. The last part of the Ethical Policy is education. Now, after the hard work of our government, five thousand indigenous people have been sent to European schools. On behalf of the Dutch Queen, our government will be responsible for the population growth in this land. And we will fulfill our promises. Thank you. William of Nassau Scion of a Dutch and ancient line I dedicate undying faith To this land of mine A prince I am, undaunted Of Orange, ever free I miss you, honey. It's cute. Honey. Since a long time ago, I have always wanted to be a white cotton. It blooms during a dry season, and can be used to make pillows. And bed for my kids. Not for your husband? For you, too. My death later will be covered by this white cotton. My ears, my nose. And I want my death to be as white as this cotton. Why did you talk about death? How do I look? There's still... There's still a lot. Dear. I've made this batik for months for you. To accompany you whenever you feel alone. Because I feel... That you will be faced with many troubles. When your husband has to follow the ever-changing nature's movements. Keep it to accompany you. Okay, Mother. SURABAYA, EAST JAVA, 1906 Mr. Tjokro. Mr. Tjokro. -I'm Hasan Ali Surati. -Yes. -Welcome to Surabaya. -Thank you. -This is Sosrokardono. -I'm Tjokro. He will help with all your needs in Surabaya. -Yes. -Don't be shy to ask for help. Thank you very much. Please bring it. This is Surabaya. IMPERIALISM FIGHTS NATIONALISM ADMINISTRATION DIRECTOR, O.S. TJOKROAMINOTO There are 300,000 students in Java and 11,000 boarding schools. The population in Java is about 30 million. This land has so many workers. Farms, plantations, workers who work on ships. It's a new age, sir. Oil trading has started. The Dutch established Royal Dutch Shell with the British. Workers emerged with their respective problems. You have talked about workers. Workers are politics. And they are an age. Sir, Surabaya has become a place where everything comes. Everything can be found here. Screws have moved the time forward. But politics, needs self-sufficient economy. And I don't want to be played by the capital owners. Because everything in this land relies on the capital owners. How would people not be afraid? How do they choose who's wrong and who's right if the truth was decided by a certain group of people without general rules? Times have changed, but the blood and minds haven't. They created an association, but it only scares the people. It happens a lot, ma'am. Happens everywhere. Especially in Pandegiling, Pasuruan, -Blauran. -Let's go. It's also like that in Malang and Pasuruan. Yes. Let's go, sir. Yes, ma'am. You think too much, Tjokro. People have gathered in the church. They want you to solve their problems. You need to act immediately. Budi Utomo Organization is currently only capable to protect the nobles. And other organizations only support their own people. We need to hurry to establish an organization that is capable to protect all people on this land no matter what. SURABAYA, EAST JAVA, 1912 Hegira. Hegira. Oh God, is this my life? THE KING AND THE PEOPLE GOVERNMENT PROHIBITS THE HOISTING OF KEKBENG'S FLAG BINTANG SOERABAIA, NEWSPAPER IN SURABAYA Come here. Granny is now old She only has two teeth left Mr. Tjokro. The Dutch troops shot the Chinese who hoisted a flag. We're not safe anymore. Our Chinese friends' shops were closed. These past few days, native traders couldn't buy batik tools and fabrics. They are restless. The Dutch are spreading rumors that the Chinese traders are hoarding items intentionally and does not care about the native traders. Mr. Tjokro. Mr. Tjokro, may I speak with you for a moment? -Yes, of course. -Pardon me, gentlemen. Mr. Tjokro, what will happen on this land? Your newspaper mentioned that Chinese revolution will happen on this land. The Chinese Emperor will fall. Who will lead the revolution on this land, Mr. Tjokro? Why do you ask me that? You are a newspaper editor. I've read your articles. Many big ships anchored at Port of Tanjung Perak. The Turkish, Yemeni, and Sudanese anchored here because it's not safe anymore in Turkey. What will happen on this land? Night in Java Emerald land Drowned in the darkness Night in Java Although it's magnificent and luxurious There's fear That slains lives -Voices -Voices -And a soft music -And a soft music -Created magical atmosphere -Created magical atmosphere Gentlemen, there are riots out there. Hey, disperse now! Back off! What's this? What's with you guys? Back off! If you move even just one step... Easy, Tjokro. Back off! Back off! If you guys are jealous because they have an association, then make a good association. You are people of Surabaya. If you're jealous because they have schools, -then make good schools. -You only cause trouble. Not to be arrogant. Not to oppress. We create an association to move forward. To protect our rights. Not to fight. -Put down your weapons! -Put it down. The government of Dutch East Indies, that's our enemy. That's our opponent! -You have to remember that! -You should have known that! -Drop your weapons! -Drop it! -Throw your weapons! -The government of Dutch East Indies doesn't want you to unite! Why? Because if the Javanese and Chinese people unite, this land will be fertile! There's no need for bloodshed. Because that won't help us gain anything. Disperse at once. Go home. Move, disperse now. Disperse now. Go home. Go home. Go home. Go. Dutch East Indies' government will be happy to see this happen. What happens when rice and sugar run out? Gosh, ma'am. Mr. Tjokro, he takes care of everything. He looks like a civil servant. Look at Slamet who lives behind our house. Mr. Tjokro asked him to take care of his land, but he did just the rice field alone. And ate the produces alone. Doesn't he feel sorry for Mr. Tjokro? But when he has troubles, he looks for Mr. Tjokro. Just watch. If people dare to come here, I'll force them to drink the river water. Hey, be careful when you talk. Work. Or the food will be burnt. Do you want to make Mr. Tjokro cook for himself? Gosh, ma'am. Yes, it's all my fault. I better apologize. -Oh, my God. -Are you going to continue? Just go. Clean the dirty glasses and plates -in the kid's room. -Oh, this mouth! -Stop it, now. -You fussy. There's one fish left. I'll eat that. Semaoen. What happened with that Gubeng Station's worker? I'm still working on that. However, everything must be calculated. -You're right. -Right? You knew it, right? Yes. I trust Semaoen. Semaoen with Tjokro is like a basket with its lid. Compatible. Nothing can compare to them. Right? Hello. -There are three cases. -Peace be upon you. -I will take care of it. -Peace be upon you, too. Tjokro, please put this on hold. There's an important matter. It's urgent. How's the meeting with our Chinese friends? Oh, it's already done. This one is more important. It's related to the article on the newspaper yesterday. -Ma'am, stools. -No, thanks. Cure for fatigue. So your butt won't get sore. No, thanks. -Hey, I want one. -Stool, sir? -Yes. -Here you go, sir. The round one, sir. A fit for your bottom. Now, your feet won't get sore anymore. -Yes. -Sir, I want one, too. -Come here. -All right. In a second, sir. -I don't want the round one. -What about the square one? The square one, please. -What's with this line, sir? -It's Tjokroaminoto. He's the Great Leader. I see. These gentlemen are from Surakarta. I think we should have coffee from the village. Arabica coffee. Has an amazing aroma. So, Tjokro. We're from Surakarta Islamists Trade Union. Yes, these gentlemen brought a message from Haji Samanhudi. -Haji Samanhudi? -Yes, Haji Samanhudi. How can I help you? Well... We heard that you were able to overcome the dispute that has happened in Surabaya. We've also heard that you're a great advocate who is always willing to help. Perhaps you have heard that these disputes have also happened in Surakarta and in Batavia. And the Dutch were accusing that we were behind the dispute in Surakarta. As always. As a result, the Dutch froze our association. Many traders can't trade anymore and we are suffering from losses. Ma'am, four cups of coffee, please. One without sugar, for me. Four, my ass. Yesterday, your friends had a meeting all day long. The coffee is running out! That's right, ma'am. I took care of Reog's group all day at Harsojo House, and there was no end to it. Ma'am, has yesterday's batik been sold? -They weren't even paid for yet. -The store hasn't opened yet. The roads are closed. Mr. Haji Samanhudi wants to have Islamists Trade Union in Surabaya, sir. And wants you to be the leader. Of course, this is a hard task, with the fact that Surabaya is the largest trading city in the East Indies. I often hear about the Islamists Trade Union. I've even met with Mr. Samanhudi regarding batik business. Please send my greetings to him. And tell him that I'm concerned. An organization that was originally only an organization from Laweyan, to protect Laweyan, and was capable to compete with our Chinese friends' trading. It's sad to hear that East Indies government froze the association, and I'm worried about the turmoil that might arise. Long live Tjokro! SURABAYA, EAST JAVA, 1913 Mr. Tjokro, with the support of the people and your ability, you surely can solve the freezing of the Islamists Trade Union. I believe in you. -Long live Tjokro! -Long live! -Long live Tjokro! -Long live! There's nothing like this with the Dutch. We just have discussions in cafes while drinking coffee and wine. Mr. Sosro, I'm Sneevliet. I want to meet Tjokro and talk with him. I'll try to talk to him. -Long live Tjokro! -Long live! -Long live Tjokro! -Long live! My brothers and sisters. Today, we gather in Surabaya to raise awareness that this association is a sign of the awakening of the people's heart that all this time was considered only a quarter of a human. That when people wake up from their sleep there's nothing that will be able to prevent its movements. ISLAMISTS TRADE UNION GATHERING, SURABAYA, 26 JANUARY 1913 East Indies is a land of hundreds of volcanoes. A land with tough people. The Islamists Trade Union is no longer supported by the Dutch government. But our fight should not stop. The struggle must continue. And the association must continue to exist. And to keep this association, me, Mr. Haji Samanhudi, and the scholars in the association, have agreed to change its name to Islamic Union. My brothers and sisters, the birth of Islamic Union is because of the blessing of God Almighty. People must unite when they struggle. The Islamic Union is just like flowing water. Not for long, it will become a heavy flood. In this union, let us move. Let us elevate the values of nobility. And together, let us resist all form of oppression. So that every single one of us are no longer seen as a quarter of a human. Who is this Bumiputera person, acting all tough? He has a mustache like Ghatotkacha. Looks like he can fly our dreams high. This is Mr. Tjokroaminoto. He is now the leader of the Islamic Union. His voice echoes, filling the land under Java's sky. Bumiputera has awakened. A new age has come, Bagong! Long live! -Long live Mr. Tjokro! -Long live! -Long live Haji Samanhudi! -Long live! -Long live Mr. Tjokro! -Long live! -Long live Haji Samanhudi! -Long live! This is the only one. It was Mr. Kurt's. What a bastard. He didn't pick up his order. He went home to the Netherlands. It's a new age, listen everyone. The great Mr. Tjokro has spoken. "Everyone is the same, no quarter of human." That's why you should read the newspaper. But you're a quarter. But wait, before you go, I want to ask you something. Are you paying with a chair? That's not enough, that's just a quarter of it. I'll pay you with four chairs, so it's a whole. Like the leader's advice, "Every Islamic Union member is a whole human." If you don't want to be paid with chairs, relax. Islamic Union now has 500,000 people. Everyone needs chairs. Politicians need chairs. I will sell it to them. Then, why did you ask me to help you after Islamists Trade Union was frozen by our government? Then why did you help us back then? Wasn't your office established by Mr. Snouck has principles that Islam as a religion is accepted, but not political Islam? And your famous ex-supervisor said that Islamic Union-- Or is this your strategy? To make use of my office's role and position and only want to help Islam who wants to cooperate. I don't know what will happen next. As if I'm riding a tiger. Or otherwise, sir. Your willingness is one of your effort to watch over us, to find out what we've been doing and strip us bare. The Chinese tigers like the ones in the circus are just a show. Or you, a smart man, a Leiden University graduate, who inherits Mr. Snouck's way of thinking, is using your knowledge and religion, to divide and destroy. Or you are a new generation, born in a new age, with a new way of thinking. Semaoen. Darsono. Darsono. Projo. Brebes, 1,050 people. Yes. Banjarmasin, 78 people. Yes. Yogyakarta, 479 people. Stand up. Stand up. No need to kneel. ISLAMIC UNION, CIREBON DIVISION -Good morning, Mr. Tjokro. -Good morning. Welcome to our place. There's food inside, sir. I am not here for food. I came to reprimand you. I've told you many times, form a cooperative immediately. One thing you need to know, an organization is like a house. A house needs a kitchen, and the cooperative is the kitchen. And to proclaim it, you need a newspaper. In Pekalongan, there's a batik cooperative, in Yogyakarta, a sugar cane cooperative, in Kalimantan, a navy cooperative. This land's crops are very abundant. This should make you prosperous, not someone else. Can you imagine your grandchildren's fate in the future? If this keeps getting taken away... Form a cooperative immediately. ISLAMIC UNION, PEKALONGAN DIVISION -Long live Master! -Long live! -Long live Master! -Long live! -Long live Master! -Long live! -Long live Master! -Long live! -Long live Master! -Long live! Mr. Tjokro! Mr. Tjokro! Mr. Tjokro! I read a publication from Berlin University. They were looking for a name for this land. Melayunesia or Indonesia? What do you think this land's name should be? Shouldn't it be you who answers it? Not everything I can answer. That's your future, so think about it. Mr. Tjokro! Melayunesia or Indonesia, Mr. Tjokro? Mr. Rinkes. Welcome to my rubber plantation. -Thank you. -Or what's left of my plantation. Sorry to keep you waiting. There's a lot to be done, but there's not enough employees. I invited you to talk. I wanted to talk about Tjokroaminoto. Do you know him? -Of course. -I knew it. He's a dangerous person. Please, be careful. All of my workers are on a strike, and it's because of him. In the history of my plantations, it has never happened before. Several years ago, he deliberately spilled some tea on me. And soon, he will shed blood in the Dutch East Indies. He's dangerous. My point is, Dutch East Indies will go bankrupt. We'll leave this land without our clothes on. Then, on our way, we'll have to eat rat's shit. Mr. Haendlift. You're too narrow-minded in reading the signs of this age. Times have changed. I understand your situation. But the old times have long passed. In this new world, we need people like Tjokroaminoto. He has become a bridge who will lead them and us to the future that is still unclear. See you, Mr. Haendlift. Thank you. What? What did you say? I warn you, Tjokro is dangerous! He took advantage of Islam to reach his political ambition! Wasn't it your own teacher, Mr. Snouck, who said that politics and religion should not be mixed? Tjokro must be imprisoned! Moonlight Moonlight on the river A crocodile emerged Sir, now Islamists Union already has so many people. Oh, really? And people call Tjokro a king without a crown. Here you go. "Javanese King Without a Crown." Javanese King without a crown? On the river Tomorrow, you all are registering to the Islamic Union. After you have registered, don't forget to write down the number. Hey, my SI number is not just a number. -Please. -Understand? Thank you. It's a talisman. A talisman for prosperity in life from the Great Leader. To be immune. Immune to suffering and misery. Tomorrow, wear a necklace like this. Put the number in here. Make sure it's not upside down. And don't forget it. Islamic Union is equal. There's no difference between rich or poor, they are considered as equal. In there, I'm considered as rich. Like a noble. I can wear a bow like a noble. Now, this is called a bowtie. Poor people can be rich people. Poor people can be nobles. We can fly. High, like a noble. So, how is it? Do I look great? A leader only needs to tell his people to plant and take care of them. This land can support England to America. Netherlands should only live from the taxes and crops of this land. But if a leader can only live from crops and the people's taxes, then this land will be wretched. The land where people took everything. There are 30 million people of Java. Only hundreds graduated from school. You guys. Semaoen, Moeso, Darsono... You are the chosen ones from the 30 million Javanese people. You will be the locomotives of millions of people through this carriage. To a better society. And you need to know, that there's no one among them who is able to read even a single letter of all your ideas. What can they do? They are able to read hopes. Their hands are able to pray. But you must remember that they are also able to go amok. Bear that in mind! There's a horse flicking a cow The cow died, and its body went limp I'm so confused with Ms. Toen She's old, but so fussy -You watch out. How dare you mock me? -Here she comes. Just you see. I won't make you breakfast. -If so, I'll eat bamboo. -I'll cook you bamboo. I want a cup. -You're so fussy. -Ouch. You've painted the castle for 69 years, but never finished. Ms. Toen, you're so fussy! Ma'am. The thing is, right now, batik Kawung, Parang Rusak and Sidomukti for noble families can be bought by the people. That's right, ma'am. The people, after listening to Mr. Tjokro's speech about equality, even batik has no differences. Poor people and nobles are equal. Ms. Toen. -Back to the kitchen! -Okay, excuse me. Not yet. How are things now? People who want to buy our batik are rare. It is said that Tjokro's speech make poor people forget their place. My noble friends were insinuating. Said that his speech make riots happen everywhere. It's not easy to live nowadays. Don't worry about it. Or you will fall sick. Just let God Almighty lead the way. Tjokro, may I speak with you for a minute? Why didn't you defend Marco? He will be clearly imprisoned because his article was defending something right that was attacking the Dutch East Indies' government. Even Mr. Sneevliet who is not a local wrote his defense in the newspaper, and assaulted the Dutch government. What for does the Islamists Union have so many members? Have so many newspapers? If we're not-- The Islamists Union is not Sneevliet. And so am I. And you need to know that I have my own way to take care of Marco and to support him. Let's go, Sosro. Semaoen is the Islamists Union. -And I-- -Semaoen. I don't want violence. I don't want things to repeated and be brought home. You will bring violence home. -Even you bring a weapon home. -That's it. Don't make a fuss. This ends here. It's enough. You can build a world as big as your ideas, -but do not destroy your home. -Let's go. -People at home can be upset, too. -That's enough, let's go. -Sosro! -Yes. Mr. Sneevliet, for what matters do you need Mr. Tjokro for? You are the founder of Social Democratic Workers' Party that I respect. What I don't understand is, how was your broad idea of socialism rejected by your own country that is even smaller than Java? Do you know? Mr. Tjokro believes that I can make this organization grow. Semaoen, I respect your confidence. Everybody sees Tjokro as a Great Leader. That his power is what others don't have. Mr. Sneevliet. Our future is not something mystical. We need a leader who is not mystical. No. He is the child of a kyai and is of Mali descendant. That's why so many people followed him, and not us. Hasn't he always cooperated with the Dutch? His friends never dared to start an organization that's not ratified by the Dutch. How is it possible to choose a leader who only wants to be a puppet? -A puppet? -The Dutch's puppet. With whom did Mr. Tjokro travel to many regions, and form branches of Islamists Union? With you, isn't it? Everyone knows you are a Dutch East Indies' official from Leiden who works under the Islamic political advisor. To make sure that Islam doesn't be a political doctrine. Who wants to cooperate with the East Indies' government. We are just an elite white organization that just discusses things while drinking coffee and wine. Mr. Sneevliet! You told us how to work radically. Why do you teach us something else now? There's always a war in Europe. And the world is completely shut down. Even the Governor-General doesn't get soldiers and guns for the government to... The Governor... And because the Dutch empire are too busy fighting in Europe, they turn the indigenous people into soldiers. Is that what you mean, sir? It's a suicidal strategy. Look at them. We will train the natives to become our armed soldiers. Look at them. They just obey while being punished! Yes. There will be rampages everywhere. I understand. I completely understand, but the economy hasn't been fixed. And not only hasn't the economy been fixed, it also seems like there's an outbreak of some kind of disease in the world. Governor-general was really worried about the emergence of the turmoil in building a country in East Indies. What policy is that? Who can control the militias? This land has so many tribes! -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Where are they from? They're the ones who escaped from the plantation. Unbelievable. This prison will definitely lack guards and soldiers. ORANGE HOTEL Mr. Tjokroaminoto. Nice to meet you. I'm Agus Salim from Sumatra. I'm your fan. I've got a present for you. -A fez from Bukittinggi. -Thank you... Agus Salim. If you don't mind, I would like to talk more... Economy crisis in East Indies. "Revolution or Evolution." Newspaper. Newspaper with a discount. -Newspaper. -Newspaper! "Revolution or Evolution," sir. -Thank you. -I want one, too. Here you go. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. Yes, thank you. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Self-government? That's bullshit! Hegira. Hegira. Where will you take me to? HEGIRA "Hidjrah"? What's that? "Hidjrah"? Hegira. Hegira? KALISOSOK PRISON, SURABAYA, 1921 It's the story of Prophet Muhammad's journey that caused resistances at the time. Can lead a new qibla. Please, sit down. May I clean my hands first? I just wrote that. Why did you write that? Why did you write that? -It must be clean. -You are from Leiden, right? It's not you who should ask, but us! Why did you write "Hegira"? My hands are clean. Like your queen who thinks clean when launching the reciprocal politics. Sir, don't waste our time. I don't want to waste time. After your country settle your debts for this country's wealth. By the pressure of a few people like Multatuli. Answer our question! Is it not permissible for inmates to do a good work? I just wrote "Hegira." That someone has the rights to have a new qibla. For a better society. It's not you who should ask, but us! You must've read an article from a Dutch journal. Van Deventer's article, a parliament and government member. An article from his guilt. He wants to go on a hegira from his old crimes. Slavery, forced planting, liberalization that sucked the farmers dry. Then why we are not allowed to go on a hegira by our own will? Sir, please answer our question! This wall has to be white and it should be white! Yes, exactly. Please bring me a long broom. What's your name? Abdullah Abdad. Are you from Yemen? Yes, I'm from Yemen. You know better about migrating than me. You are a rebel for our kingdom! Our spies have gathered clear evidence. We know about the provocation that you have spread to the Bumiputera people through your articles in Bintang Seorabaia, Sinar Djawa, Oetoesan Hindia, and many other newspapers. Not to mention your private flyers that we've got from Islamic Union. Everything shows one similarity-- -Sir. -Hold it! An invitation to hate the Dutch East Indies' government. Hate the government or opening the people's eyes to the oppression that has been happening all this while? In Semarang... Semarang is the place where the labor movement is rampant. There, the radicals rule. And you were there in 1905. What were you doing there? I get it. You were there to train your abilities, to organize, and demonstrate. What's your proof that I have demonstrated there? Don't dodge our question! Answer it! I'll answer it, but will you believe that my presence in Semarang was to work? Work? Work, you said? Yes, work. Clean it! If you erase that writing, it's the same as you erasing your own history. And you. HEGIRA What are you going to say in the congress in Bandung tomorrow? I'll talk about how to create your own government and law. -It's really important to convey it. -Moeso! -Father called for you. -Regarding people protection. Pardon me. -Sir, this is the flyer. -Yes? PENELEH HOUSE, SURABAYA, 1916 There will be approximately 2.5 million people attending. -How many divisions? -It's 181 divisions. 181 divisions. -Pen. -Yes? Tomorrow, probably the ones from Sumatra and Kalimantan will join us. -What's wrong? -Confirm who will be attending. Sneevliet probably will be there. But Soewardi and Douwes Dekker are still in exile. Right, Kyai Hasyim can't attend. He is forming a new organization, Nahdlatul Ulama. But he asked to speak for a moment. -Yes. -Dr. Tjipto probably will be there. Okay. There's good news, Tjokro. Kyai Ahmad Dahlan can attend the congress tomorrow. There's an 80 percent chance he will come. That's great. Please make sure he attends. Because he will act as an advisor in tomorrow's congress in Bandung. I've arranged everything. It's done. -Please eat the banana, Gus. -Thank you. -Ms. Toen. -Yes? -I'm Koesno. -Please. Yes. Thank you. Sir, the name board is ready. What's this? The name board he ordered. He's still busy now. Come back later. -Ma'am. -Yes? Semaoen. Semaoen! Hermen, where is Semaoen? Semaoen can't be here, he's at ISDV. -ISDV? -Yes. What's that? A new socialist organization in Surabaya. What is his position? He will most probably be a secretary. Mr. Tjokro. -Who's this? -It's me. Tomorrow's congress will definitely be held. I've forgotten about you. -Oetari. -Yes, Father? What's your name? My name is Koesno, sir. -Koesno. -Yes. -Shall we? -Yes. -Right here? -Yes. -Koesno! -Yes, sir? This house is for sharing questions. So, share it. And I have a question for you. If VOC produces 180 million gulden every year, how much they have produced until now? No need to answer it now. Later. -Please. -Yes. -Thank you. -Okay. -Oetari. -Yes, Mother. Clean up Father's stuff. -Oetari, hurry up. -Yes, Mother. Moonlight Moonlight on the river A crocodile emerged Thought to be dead Don't trust A man's words Dare to swear But afraid to die Moonlight Moonlight on the river A crocodile emerged Thought to be dead The Peneleh House is water source. You are free to take the water, bring it anywhere. How you use it depends on you. How about Semaoen, Mr. Tjokro? -What's wrong with Semaoen? -He rarely comes here. Is he the mastermind behind the strikes that happened? Semaoen is smart. Whatever he does must have a basis. Though he rarely comes here, I'm sure that Semaoen would never waste the water he took from Peneleh House. Sir, have you read the news? About what? The new Governor-general has formed a representative council. Volksraad. I think it's just lip service, sir. Our Islamists Union friends feel very sorry that you agreed on the formation of Volksraad. We can't always be sure that Volksraad will go along with our aspirations. But the water from Peneleh must always flow through every gap. And so does Volksraad. We must keep even the slightest hope. Sir. On behalf of CIU, allow me to say my welcome to the congressmen, the leaders of divisions who have come today. BANDUNG, WEST JAVA, 1916 In this congress, there are some things that we need to discuss. This land should no longer be led by the Dutch! Agree! That this land should no longer be dairy cows that are fed and have its milk taken away. Agree! BANDUNG, 17-24 JUNE 1916 When that happens, our homeland will be a country with its own government. Together, we will protect our own interests regardless of language, nation, and religion. This will happen in ten years. My brothers, the Asian sun has come. New Asian nations are born! And the motherland born from the nation, is the unity and spirit as a nation. Unity and spirit, my brothers. Spirit that will bring our children to acknowledge the birth of this nation. Honey. Honey. Honey. Don't sleep on the floor. You are sick. -Okay. -Come on. Thanks a lot. Here, for an extra. How do I pay it? I'll pay you some other time. Gosh, what should I do? Okay. Oh, why so many? It's reaching my head. Oh, Ms. Toen, poor you! Here it is. I can't take it anymore. Wait, hold on. Hold on, Toen. This, one more. Lift it! One more! Lift it, stupid! Damn! Move. Where do you want to go? -Where? -There's a meeting, Mother. I told you to join an art workshop, like me. Arts are outdated, Mom. Outdated. Now is a political era. -Politics are number one, Mother. -Goodness. -Take care. -Do I look good? Of course you do. You're my son after all. -I'm leaving. -Okay, take care. Here you go, sir. Your order is done. It's good, sir. There's carving from Jepara, sir. Circular pattern. Yes, the Governor must be happy with it. They will hang you in the city square. Read this. "Stirum," sir. One more time. "Governor Stirum," sir. Try again. I swear to God, "Governor Stirum," sir. You try and read this. -This is "Stirum," sir. -"Stirum," sir. This is not "Stirum," but "Stoom." You idiot! You read it wrong, sir, this is "Stirum." They will hang you in the city square. Gosh, there's no warm water! Again, no water! Towel! Bring me a towel! Where's the towel? Rinkes. Yes, Your Majesty? The kingdom faces many problems. There's war in Europe. I don't want any other problems. I want everything to be peaceful. I'll talk about all of this with Tjokro. Talk about it with Tjokro? I'm not like the old Governor-general! I don't want any riots or anything to happen! Go! Bath water! Bath water, for God's sake! -Get out! -Get out! You see? That's what we call culture. And the Dutch brought it here. Look at these paintings. The Dutch brought it here. And to keep this, we have to start to form Volksraad. Natives here only dream about their own country. Volksraad members must be the ones who explain to the indigenous. The meaning of an autonomy like this. You mean like a lure, right? Politics here is like children's politic. Full of alluring promises, all sweet talks, they got offered good positions, promises of powers. Do you think this is enough to shut them up? Shut their mouth? I don't have sweet coffee currently. Only the bitter one! Gentlemen, in today's session, we'll talk about the most important agenda that will be brought to the Volksraad. And according to Mr. Tjokroaminoto, the most important agenda is education, 15 years. You have to be careful. It's true that education is important. But agrarian affairs are more important. -True. -Right. So, guys, farmers, laborers, should have their own land. -Yes! -Agree! Wait a minute. The issue with land is indeed important. But education is even more important. -Yes! -That's right! This land needs important people. Who are they now? Who are those important people? Only a few. -Sir-- -Education is more important. -Right! -You think so? Ask them. You see, our friends who are here today, -everyone has lost their land rights. -That's right! Now you tell me, which one is more important? Education or agrarian affairs? -Land! Agrarian affairs! -Education! -Wait a minute. -Gentlemen! All of us here are well-educated people. It's not appropriate to speak like that. Speak one at a time. People's rights to their own land. That's the most important. Because later, when we have our own government, if people don't have their own rights to their land, that's just the same as a comedy! -So, what do we need? -Land! What do we need? -Land! -Land! -Land! -Mr. Semaoen. -Land! -Gentlemen. What this land really needs is well-educated people like Mr. Semaoen. That's why, education is still the priority. -Yes, right! -Education! -Long live education! -Education! Land! Bolshevik Revolution in Russia? It bore a new word. The minority becomes the majority. Private property becomes common good. This kind of ideas create new expectations in this country. Yes? Also for farmers here. Them? They can start a revolution here. Like the workers in Russia right now. The workers in Russia found a new word, "anti-colonialism." I've also heard about majority and minority everywhere. All right, good boy. There. Stand up straight. We'll leave with a horse carriage soon. It's done. Are you studying now? We need to leave shortly! -I'm done. -Wait a minute. Gosh, these kids. Let's go! Oetari, come on! Or you'll be late. Anwar, Harsono, Suyud. Islami, let's go! Come on. Mr. Tjokro, we just got an official report that the rice we've imported carried mice and diseases. Many people were affected by typhus. There's a possibility that your wife is affected with typhus. We'll keep checking. Whatever you need, make sure it's well recorded. Islamists Union has more than 100 branches. Many people need treatment. I'll also ask for help from Kyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan, from Muhammadiyah. To get us what we need. Mr. Tjokro. There's something I need to tell you. Just a minute. I have to visit another place now. I'm sorry. Just a minute, sir. Just a minute, sir. Just a minute. Sir, who are the natives? Why do you ask me that? Your own organization talked about self-government. Own law for the natives. Then, who am I, Mr. Tjokro? Who are the natives? My grandma is a slave from Bali. She married a Dutch cook, who wanted to learn how to cook Dutch East Indies' food. I'm not indigenous, neither a Dutch. So, who am I, Mr. Tjokro? Even my Dutch pastor didn't want to baptize me, Mr. Tjokro. Who will protect me? Wait, sir. Please help me. Where is your father? Mr. Tjokro. My father is in the Netherlands, sir. Sir, have you ever felt the feeling of being a child of a woman who was always called a mistress because she married a Dutchman? Being a child who was always called a kafir? Kafir. Slut. Slut. My father forced me to leave, sir. My mother didn't want to. I ran away, sir. I ran away. I ran away until my father's gone. One day, I heard someone said to my mother that the Dutch judiciary will come soon to take me. They will take me out of this land, Mr. Tjokro. They will take me out of this land. My beloved land. I don't want to, Mr. Tjokro. I don't want to leave. I don't want to leave. -I'll try to help you. -I don't want to. I don't want to, Mr. Tjokro. I'll try my best to help you. But I have to go now. Mr. Tjokro. Mr. Tjokro. If this land has its own government, who am I? Am I indigenous, or the same as now? Homeless and exiled. Sir. Please help me, Mr. Tjokro. I'll keep trying to form our own government. And make laws that can protect people like you. To stay on this land. Mr. Tjokro, help me, sir. Lir ilir, lir ilir The seeds are blossoming So rich and green, just like newlyweds Shepherd boy, shepherd boy Please climb up that starfruit tree It is slippery, but please climb it I need the fruit to wash my clothes My clothing, my clothing Is torn down the side I need to mend it quickly To go to the king's court this evening While the moon is bright While many people gather Let's cheer together Cheers! Hooray! Calm down, my brothers. Members of Islamic Union that I respect, calm down. Even without Mr. Tjokro's presence, the meeting will keep going. Right, gentlemen? Why couldn't he come to such an important meeting like this? -Right. -Yes. Whereas he always attends every meeting held at Volksraad that has no correlation to us. What Darsono said was right. Mr. Tjokro's presence is really needed here. Why did he prefer to attend the one in the Volksraad? -Right, gentlemen? -Yes! -Right, gentlemen? -Mr. Tjokro must be here! Gentlemen. I, Agus Salim, came all the way from Sumatra. Because I really respect the Islamic Union. In my land, every word from leaders needs proof. And you, you don't have any proof, except for your unlimited words. That can't be! Words from a person with proof is the Islamic soul. That's not it, the presence of Mr. Tjokro is needed here, gentlemen! -Right, gentlemen? -That's right! Right! We don't talk about Mr. Tjokro's personal matters. Gentlemen! Gentlemen, listen to what Gandhi said! Gandhi who united Asia said... For that, we as the members of the Islamic Union, should unite! Why? Because a nation can only be formed from humanity. And your words, Mr. Darsono, have eliminated humanity. Humanity that will unite us, gentlemen! It's not about Gandhi! It's not about humanity! But it's about Mr. Tjokro's justice. So his presence is really needed! Hey, calm down. We are not here to talk about Mr. Tjokro's personal issues. We are here to talk about our organization, the Islamic Union. Don't let the Islamic Union become like Volksraad. That will become a joke! Wake up, people who are insulted Wake up, people who are hungry Noble will in the world Are always getting bigger Eliminate old customs and understandings We are people who have awakened The world has change its face For our victory The workers were from the peasants. Batik vendors, weavers, and small traders from various nations. And they lost their jobs because of factories, machinery, as well as big traders. I invite all workers here to unite! And if there's any political association who don't support our unity, don't support them! -Long live! -Long live! -Long live! -Long live! My friends, independence, equality, and brotherhood are Islamic. You may have different ideas. And ideas are always good. Nationalism, communism, and socialism. But the dangerous one, is when your hands are used to translate words with violence. That's dangerous. Islam is a greeting of peace. Islam... is a struggle to move forward for a better life. -Long live! -Long live! He is still too slow. Whatever he needs, there is still one word that they need. "Revolution." Without revolution, we can't save this country. -Long live! -Long live! -Bitter bean, please. -Okay. Stella! Stella. Why didn't you sell all of your newspapers? Your mom's shop will go bankrupt. The newspapers wrote that Islamic Union is in pieces. How could they build their own government? I don't want to sell it. Come on, you. Think of your trade. Don't talk about politics. We have to know politics. Politics create laws. It decides one's lives. As well as my fate, and your Stambul comedy's fate. Wake up, people who are insulted Wake up, people who are hungry Noble will in the world Are always getting bigger Eliminate old customs and understandings We are people who have awakened Mr. Sosro, look! Along this river, I rule over it. And workers here must know that they have a meaning. In Semarang, we managed to rally strikes. Until the capital owners accepted all of our demands. Look at Mr. Tjokro, that old man. He is too careful. Everyone will leave him. You just don't know. I'm already at my limit, I'm tired. -I follow him everywhere. -Dude, you are smart. Good at organizing, determined. You should've been more than just his clerk. You don't know. I often discuss it. I accompany him everywhere. I often persuade him, but there's no result. Your pen should be your weapon. Be a hoe or a sickle. Every peasant and worker can work for self-welfare. That's what I call future. So what should I do? Let me tell you. Bolshevik Revolution in Russia has given us an absolute proof. That poor people could overthrow the bourgeoisie. Never mind that. It's time for you to get out from those big ideas. Join us now. Are you sure that if I join you, we can compete with them? Islamic Union needs the word "revolution" to move the people. Revolution doesn't fit with our land. And we have to use the Malay language. Look at the peasants in Russia. They have done a revolution. Self-government must have its own language, and its evolution. -It doesn't have to be evolution. -Evolution. -We need a revolution here. -Hey. You both have discussed for so long, are you not tired? Did you know? Rice is a revolution. Secondary crops are also a revolution. Think, don't just talk! Your stomachs are also a revolution. Are you not hungry? I'm hungry because of all these talks. Here you go. Keep away from revolution. ISLAMIC UNION The difference between revolution and evolution is only the letter R. R is for resident. Be careful when using that word. Yes, sir. I'll eat first, sir. How's the progress of our hegira, Gus? Mount Arafat, perhaps. It's quiet, and it's time to ask God to accompany us. I always dreamt about violence. I'm worried that this hegira... Is it a hegira with weapons... or trade? To the point that the leaders are traded. Haven't you said that history will be answered later? Yes. Rinkes, I've heard so many bad news. I've told you that the kingdom doesn't need problems. But we need money for the war in Europe. And there's one other thing. I've got news about a young man named... Semaoen, Your Majesty. Semaoen or whoever it is. That he invited the furniture factory workers to go on a strike and such. There's still another news that I want to tell you, about a rebel who is actively promoting his movement in some areas and is encouraging people to commit violence. A dangerous man. Find him, whatever it takes. -And? -And arrest him! A giant crocodile, sir. A giant crocodile entered the village, sir. It's a bad omen! Sir, we got a new instruction from Governor-general. We have to go now, sir. GARUT PLANTATION, WEST JAVA, 1919 Our harvest keeps decreasing from day to day. And they don't care. Taxes keep increasing. Now, we don't have anything anymore. Except for our intentions. Good intentions. The path between us and God. Good intentions won't fade because of words. Won't be eroded by the times. In the name of God. In the name of God. Shoot them! Why don't you admit that you are the one who caused this chaos? KALISOSOK PRISON, SURABAYA, 1921 These are the evidence. Semaoen, the leader of the workers movement in Semarang led the demonstration with Sneevliet. You must know Sneevliet. An exile from the kingdom. A rebel! A radical. Moeso, your student. Sosro, your personal assistant. And every other suspect. Abdul Muis, an important person in Islamic Union, a union that you lead yourself. He's the one who supported those riots. And all of this, sir, if you are not the mastermind, then who? No need to add the note. I can add more than that about our own history. I obeyed the laws that you've created. My other friends are Muslims who obeyed the law you've created. We refer to Volksraad as a comedy. Do you know what's the meaning of comedy? Our evidence is not just comedy! Mr. Tjokro. You really are good at strategy. -Strategy? -Yes. Abdullah. Is your arrival here a strategy or a hegira? From Yemen to Malacca, then to this land? -Hegira. -Please sit down. Sit. It's not about a puppeteer and his puppets. Iqra. Read. Read. May I prepare my plea now? We are trapped in our own prison. We are the new generation, living in a new age. We should not be trapped in our minds anymore. It's time for a hegira from our own prison. PENELEH HOUSE, SURABAYA, 1919 I already know everything that happened. The Dutch governments get along well. They wanted us to be divided and exiled. I don't want violence here, that's not good for the children. Everything will eventually happen. Both with kindness and violence. There's nothing wrong with the ideas that come to this land. What's dangerous is the way of violence to execute them. But the violence has come to this house. Oetari. Go to bed. Honey! -I said go to bed! -Honey! Oetari, it's okay. Just calm down, nothing will happen. What's that letter, sir? It's from the court. Read and study it. -Everything will be fine. -Okay. I won't let violence get in here. ORANGE HOTEL You, over there. Hey. Where are you going? I want to buy medicine. It's a curfew! I know, but the madam is sick. Yes, but you have to obey. Go home! Go home. Please rest in your room. Sorry, I didn't get the medicine. Don't worry, ma'am. Just rest. Hegira. Hegira. My dear, it turns out I can't form my own hegira. The world changes unpredictably. Revolutions from various parts of the earth have come to this land. They have brought various nations and ideas. My dear, I want to go home today. I want to accompany you and our children who have grown up. This hegira will be a long one. It has brought together bright young men from Java, Sumatra, Borneo, from every corner of this land. My fatigue disappears. Wait for me. Surabaya is not peaceful anymore, sir. So what should we do? Why didn't you tell me? Honey. -Honey. -Yes. Meet them. This house is also their home. Yes. They... They need you. Yes, don't worry. I've told them. Koesno's there, he'll take care of everything. Ma'am. My hegira this time will include you. As I promised. Please calm down, everyone. Mr. Tjokro will explain to you about the problems that is happening in Surabaya. You said you wanted to be like a white cotton. Be a pillow, a shawl, a blanket for your people. The people are waiting. Ma'am. -Honey. -Meet them. -I will. -They need... They need you. -Yes, in a moment. -Meet them. Ma'am. My brothers and sisters. The situation certainly does not reassure us all. Many of us were arrested because of our ideas and struggles. But today, your presence here assured me that the ideas for the future will never die! This day... This house... Feels like a nation. It's our home. Our struggle is our home. Mr. Tjokro said that -he wanted to be covered in white cotton. -A shelter, hiding place, -Give it to him. Give it. -a place to think, share thoughts... -Be strong, be patient. -He wanted to be covered... Wait for him. ...which make us want to become a nation that cares for humanity. A nation that fights for humanity. Sir, pardon me. Please see her for a moment. Honey. Honey. Ma'am! -Ma'am! -Forgive me, God. Madam. Forgive me, God. Madam... My brothers and sisters. We have to convey a sad news. Our mother... Mrs. Soeharsikin has passed away. Sosrokardono, you are under arrest! I can walk by myself! Take those flags down! Please don't get too close. Mr. Sneevliet, in an hour, you'll be deported. The ship will leave to Rotterdam in an hour. Thank you. HARSOJO HOUSE What's the progress of our hegira, Gus? Some of our friends were arrested by the Dutch. And some others have joined the Red Union. There's nothing wrong with the upcoming ideas. Everything has its own place. Will you give up your own hegira? Seven years ago, since I became the interpreter for the Dutch East Indies government, I was in Jeddah. It was the Islamic Union that regulated the pilgrims' entire journey. And almost every pilgrim said the name, Tjokroaminoto, the great. Then I asked myself, "Hey, Agus Salim. Who are you? Where do you want to go?" Like the story of Prophet Muhammad SAW. There's always loneliness and isolation in every hegira. And I, Agus Salim, will go on my hegira with Tjokroaminoto. There's only one way to go on hegira. No matter how much knowledge you have or how clever the strategy, and how pure the tawhid. PENELEH HOUSE, SURABAYA, 1921 Calm down, my people! Don't destroy all of this with violence, even if we have powers to do that. I will walk myself to the court. I will prove that there are no prisons that are capable to imprison the people's freedoms and hopes! No bullets and courts are capable to hold our justice and our rights. Let us make our dreams come true together. To build our own government. In a new age, with the world laws. KALISOSOK PRISON Sir! Keep moving, sir. Come on. Please. Hurry up. Stella. Stella. Mr. Tjokro has been arrested. I've heard about it. Then, what do we do? I pray every day. Because I can only pray for him through this poetry. "When the mind is fearless and the head is always raised. When the knowledge is free. When a clear sense does not lose its path to the desert. Tired of the dying bad habits. When the soul of my blood drives me towards the bigger thoughts and actions. Towards the heaven of freedom. Father, let my country rise." Oh God, am I still on your qibla? When You brought me to one prison to another. Or is the prison my hegira? To understand human and their freedom. Oh God, is this my long way to my hegira? Tjokroaminoto was released after six months in prison because he was proven innocent. The word "Indonesia" was used by the Bumiputera people to replace the Dutch East Indies. The Islamic Union was split into two. One side followed Tjokro and Agus Salim. The other followed Semaoen to the Red Islamic Union, the forerunner of the Indonesian Communist Party. Oetari married Koesno (Soekarno) a few months after her mother died. Koesno (Soekarno) formed Indonesian National Party. He proclaimed Indonesia's independence day on 17 August 1945 after Japan's defeat in World War II. In 1923, Semaoen was exiled. After independence, he came back to Indonesia and became president Soekarno's personal advisor. Agus Salim became the first Indonesian minister of foreign affairs after independence. Moeso was involved in the Madiun Affairs in 1948 and died. Tjokroaminoto died in 1934 in Yogyakarta. Subtitle translation by Dandi Amirullah
