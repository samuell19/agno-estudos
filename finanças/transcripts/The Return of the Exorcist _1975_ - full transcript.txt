(unsettling music) (multiple overlapping conversations off mic) - Beloved brothers, it is with a heavy heart that we address our words. In these sad, tormented times, tempests of horror and violence seem to be breaking over the world. The deadly breath, the devil, verging the very foundations of our faith, vanishing from your hearts the sweetness of hope. And extinguishing in us the pure flame of love. But do not fall prey to doubt and in-servitude. Hold fast. The devil defeated forever in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ shall never break the Citadel of the church. Blinded by pride some would try to convince us that the devil does not exist, that he is nothing but an abstract idea. Such ideas are folly. Brothers, today more than ever satan is present and active in the world. Bleeding sheep, stinking herd of groveling swine. He has never ceased in his wiles. He has never despaired, but be one day the master of our hearts and our bodies. Be alert brothers, pray. Cringe, crawl, embrace yourselves. This proper kingdom, (mumbles) provide. I hate you. I hate you. (laughing) (eerie music) (wind blows increasingly) (upbeat music) Glory to thy name, oh satan prince of darkness. Lord of the world I today, thy servant and thy minister, the instrument of thy will, pray thee almighty and all powerful one, that though shouldest enter this sacred host and enter into the heart and soul of this, my chosen mate. Thy servants, thirsty for war, eager for the great dawn of Armageddon, century after century are waiting in anguish for thy presence. God of blood and violence, great liberator, angel of the sword, messenger of revolt, black angel of death, listen to me. Hear me. Divine destroyer, hope of the downtrodden, thou knowest that thy rebel angels are only waiting for thy sign. Liberate us, thy words are our sacred gospel. Remove our fear, our hesitations. Make the timid brave. Thou art the liberator of man. Now is the time. Reveal thyself to us as the lord of life. Give us the strength to commit the worst atrocities in thy name. Thy servants are afraid to go into the world and bring about the apocalypse. Rejoice in us, thy chosen ones. Into thy mighty hands we shall place this world of objective justice and lay it at thy feet oh satan, lord of the universe. Come to us master. Hear the prayers of thy faithful, thy servants. Fill our hearts with violence and perversions. (crowd calling in agreement) Let us pray that thou wilt multiply thy appearances, thy strange guises that confound the reason of all men. This is what we ask for us, thy sons, disciples and soldiers, power and glory and riches. Thou are the light to thy soldiers, thy rebels, we the loyal sons of the mightiest of all. (laughing) May thy enemies be vanguished. May thy name be honored from generation to generation oh satan. (women laughing gleefully) (men mumbling) - [Voiceover] Pulse is normal. Well, she'll be alright. - Agnes! What happened? What is it Doctor? - Well your brother went wild and attacked her. And seemed he was in a kind of a trance. I was obliged to tie him to his bed. He had another crisis and he attacked Agnes while she was trying to soothe him. Michael and I got here just in time. I gave him a sedative to calm him. He's asleep right now. This last crisis I'm afraid confirms my worst fears. With Peter's case I can only suggest an institution. - [Nun] Institution? - Well he can't stay here. It'd be too dangerous for him and for the others. (man crying out) - I must go to him. (suspenseful music) Peter. It's me, Elena. - Untie me. I'm in pain. - Peter. - You whore, filthy slut. (screaming) Damn. Come here. Scared, you lecherous bitch. (screams) Come here. (laughing) (sobbing) - He must be sent to an institution at once. - No. Please, anything but that Doctor. - I'm sorry, but you must try to be reasonable. You've seen for yourself the state that Peter is in. It's a very bad case of hysteria and your brother has absolute need for special treatment that only a psychiatric hospital can provide. - Yes, I see. Are you a practicing Christian Doctor? - Why do you ask me that question? - Because Peter is. - I see what you're getting at. For me it's a case of hysteria, nothing more. If he has the right treatment he'll get better. I want you to see he's confined to a hospital. - [Elena] No. - What's your objection to a psychiatric hospital, then? - They're like hell on Earth. Unfortunately a few years ago I had personal experience of that. (unsettling music) (frenzied music) (screaming) No Doctor, it's out of the question. (gasps) (yelling) (glass breaks) Oh God. (glass breaks) (screaming) (yelling) (glass breaks) (yelling) (quiet, peaceful organ music) - [Priest] In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen. Speak my child. - It's about my brother, Father. Something terrible's happening to him. At first I didn't believe it. I couldn't. But now I feel sure that it's not just a mental condition as Doctor Ferry thinks. It's much more serious Father. It all began the day that Peter went on a trip with some friends. (funky, eerie music) (camera clicks) (camera clicks) - [Voiceover] Peter. - [Voiceover] Peter, where are you? (laughing) - Oh Sherry, it's you. - Well what's the idea of screwing you off? - Sherry, you know what I saw, by the waterfall? A naked girl. - No you're not-- - No, I took some pictures. She was right over there. - A naked girl here, come on. He's crazy, this isn't a nudist colony. The poor kid's seeing things I guess. He's overworked, Peter, starting to have visions. - [Sherry] See ya. (laughing) - But, I got some photos of her, I tell you. Bunch of idiots. Right there, she was right over there on the waterfall. - Well, where is she now? If the lady was there and you took a picture, I just wonder what happened to her. Anyway, I suppose that by the time you pushed the button she'd rushed off. - I saw her there. I wasn't imagining it. How 'bout the others? The ones I took before. - I'm sorry, strictly nothing, all blank. (unsettling music) (medium paced dance music) - Oh, thank you Andre. - [Sherry] Thank you. - It's only normal, it's youth I guess. - Yes, that's right. Still they shouldn't make an exhibition of themselves. I'm feeling a bit worried about Peter. - Why? - He's going through a difficult period. - 10 past 12, come on. (Sherry giggles) Hey everybody, Sherry reached adulthood 10 minutes ago. - [Voiceover] Congratulations. - Welcome to the club. - [Sherry] Thanks. - [Peter] My friends, let's drink to this great occasion. - Maybe we'd better join them in there. - Why not? - Here you are. All the best Sherry dear. - And lots of luck. - Ah thank you. - May you get everything your heart desires. - Thanks. (eerie crying) Oh, no, don't, oh stop that! - [Older Woman In Black] Peter, what a way to behave. Are you crazy? Go and apologize at once! - Sherry, come back. (Sherry sobs) Sherry! (engine revs) Sherry! (eerie music) (eerie crying) (woman crying out) My special lucky charm. - Now what's keeping him? - You know him, while be late for his own funeral. Oh there you are at last. - Sorry. - What was it took you so long? - Oh, I just couldn't find my pullover. - Anyhow, it's so late now it's practically not worth going. - [Seated Woman] Sherry's right, it's not nice to keep her waiting. - Who sent this telegram? - It's from Elena, she's not coming yet. She can't come before next month. - What's gotten into him now? - Nothing. Peter loves his sister. He's just disappointed she's not coming. - Oh, I see. Is she married? - No, she isn't. She's a nun, a missionary in Africa. - She's a missionary? - Yes my dear. She did a couple of years of medicine at college and then she decided to be a missionary. - But taking holy orders? - (mumbles) vocation. I'm afraid that Peter took it rather hard. It was as if he'd been robbed, as if he'd lost something. It's funny, only Elena was more like his mother, than his sister. - And you? - Me? I was often away with his father, a geologist. We both traveled a lot. I realized I wasn't the mother to him he should have had. - My child, the ways of the Lord are often inscrutable. We must all pray for his divine guidance and go on. - [Elena] That day was so horrible. (upbeat dance music) (panting) (eerie music) - Get away. - [Voiceover] (laughing) I'm here. You've been looking for me, haven't you. The waterfall, do you remember? Do you recognize me? Do you know who I am? Are you afraid of me? There's no need to be afraid. You mustn't be. Come. Come. Come into me. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. (yells) (woman laughing) (upbeat dance music) That's it, kill me. Kill me. (gasping) Well what are you waiting for? (laughs) (upbeat dance music) (laughing) (eerie, somber music) (metal clanking in distance) (suspenseful music) (wind howls) (woman yells) (yelps) (grunting) (porcelain breaks) (clatter) (glass breaking) - Help! Help, help, Peter. Where are you? Michael, Agnes, for the love of heaven, help. Help! (startling tones) Peter. Peter! Peter! Peter. (gasps) Peter. Oh my darling, what's the matter? Darling, answer me. Peter. What happened? - I don't know. I musta drank too much. And fallen asleep here. - There was someone there, in your bed. A woman. - [Peter] Are you crazy? - At first I thought it was you. And then she, she attacked me, like a fury. Like a maniac. - That's just not possible. There couldn't have been anyone in my room, no. There couldn't have been. - [Voiceover] Who is it? - Police. - What can I do for you? - I'd like to see Mr. Forti, Peter Forti. - This way. - Good morning. - Good morning. It concerns a certain young lady called Sherry. We've found nothing else of interest in her purse other than the diary with your name and address in it. - Sherry? Is anything wrong? - I'm afraid she met her death in strange circumstances. (scary tones) - Sherry? My god. Oh mother. - You're the only lead we have to go on for the moment and we'd like you to come and identify the body of the victim. - [Peter] I can't. Maybe I can. - Just follow me. - [Peter] That's Sherry. How did it happen? Who did it? - We don't know. The evidence is hard to believe. Witnesses claim that she fell over suddenly with her throat cut and that nobody was near her. (woman crying) (eerie music) - I don't think we need to detain you here. You can go. - Yes, yes. (funky, eerie music) (panting) (startling tone) (groaning) Mama, help me please. You've gotta help me. - Peter! Darling. Peter. (moaning) - [Voiceover] Let me into you. Into you. (chuckles) (screams) Hmm, open to me, lovely widow, open. You have an abstinate jewel. Don't resist me. You'll like this. You'll love it. You'll love it, you lecherous sow. Let yourself go. (chuckles) - [Mama] No, help! (laughs) Help, Michael, Agnes, help! Help, help! (screams) (laughing) - In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen. Let us pray. Oh Lord, thou who in thy boundless grace doth give rest to thy faithful. Bless today this tomb and watch over it with all thy blessed saints. While the mortal play remaineth below, receive the soul free of the sins of the flesh. May it rejoice with thee in everlasting bliss. Oh Lord, thou who art our salvation, has conquered death through the passion of thy son. Oh Lord bless the sepulcre of our beloved sister Barbara, to whom we bid farewell on her last journey. May she sleep in peace, to rise again on the day of judgement through Jesus Christ our Lord. - [All] Amen. (woman laughing) (woman laughing) (eerie music) - [Voiceover] Let yourself go, sweet flesh. Show me that you are alive. Give me your lips. Free the flame that burns within you. Take me in your arms, hold me. Open your mind to me before you kill me. Let yourself go sweet flesh. Show me you are alive. Give me your lips. Free the flame that burns within you. Take me in your arms, hold me. Open your mind to me before you kill me. Let yourself go sweet flesh. Show me you are alive. Give me your lips. Free the flame that burns within you. Take me in your arms, hold me. Open your mind to me before you kill me. (speaks in foreign language) - Amen. - Elena, I've been wanting to say this for several days. Only I don't know how to put it. It's hard to try and express what I feel. I can't understand it. It seems so absurd. But it's, it's as though there were another person in me who takes over, who possesses me. (eerie tones) (gasps) (wind howling) (screaming) (door squeaking and pounding) (screaming) - Peter, in your room. It, Peter, come quick. - You must hold me. Help me Elena. I need you. (sad, eerie music) (upbeat music) (eerie music) (funky, eerie music) - No Peter. For the love of heaven, what are you doing? - Why are you spying on me? - No, I'm not spying. I thought you needed me, that's all. You must tell me Peter, like when you were a little boy. Now we're all alone again. We've often been alone. Only if you don't say the things in your heart, how can I be able to help you? Tell me everything. What's the matter? I've got to know. - No way, Elena. - No, your torment, all of it. I beg of you Peter. Let yourself be examined by a doctor as soon as possible. - Examined by a doctor? Of what use can doctor be to me? Elena, you don't understand. And you say you wanna help me. (suspenseful music) (machine beeping) (machine whirring) (machine beeping) (thunder crashes) (gasps) (thunder crashes) (gasps) (whimpers) (woman moans) (thunder crashes) (gasps) (woman moans) - No, don't. Don't. No. - [Voiceover] Come you bitch in heat. Your virginity is mine. (groans) - No! (sighs) (frenzied music) (startling tones) (screams) (whimpers) (eerie tones) (gasps) - As you requested, we gave your brother an extremely detailed examination but the result is negative. Your fears are unfounded for the time being. From a clinical point of view I can assure you that the young man is in perfect health, whatever you may think, Sister. His electroencephalogram gives the same result. Thus, the only conclusion we might be tempted to draw is that these troubles stem from some paranormal phenomenon. Unfortunately I can think of no other explanation. - [Elena] I'm so scared that even harder trials are in store for us Father. - Have faith in divine mercy. Was not our Lord himself tempted by the devil? I will try to help you with this nightmare. I shall bring it to the attention of my Lord Bishop. He will be able to help. You must not lose your courage, Sister. (eerie tones) - No! Don't touch me with your amulets. Go away, go away! Go away, go away. Go away, go away! (screams) (speaking in foreign language) - Thank you Lord, you've lightened my darkness and confirmed my worst suspicions. This rogue priest was therefore sent to the said diocese in the year of grace, 1723. And there did well until the day when to the stake he came. The aforesaid heretic priest had with him taken another lost soul, a young woman of obscure origin. But erelong it was learned that she had been wondrously conceived in the belly of satan. Such were her hellish wiles that she did bend to her will and to the base desires of the priest Johannes, the eldest daughter of the Duke of Gianni Forti, the lady Anna, Johannes was tireless in blasphemy of the Holy Cross and in leading to everlasting damnation, the souls of the unstable and weak. His purpose was to profane the lady Anna, the damsel pure and chaste. Thus it was the triumph of his crime when the woman had weakened the will and senses of the damsel to her purpose that the damsel should be an unwitting sacrifice in the abomination of a black mask. Johannes, a priest of great learning, was brought to his doom by exorcism and by the constant battle waged by the monks against his evil power. His vice was such that he did cause to be portrayed on the soles of his feet the image of the cross. For the base lust of trampling the sacred symbol underfoot when and where he wished. The lady Anna became with child of this monster. She was repudiated by her family and sent forth. She lived as a vagabond, avoiding the company of mankind, suffering the pangs of want, hiding herself for fear of righteous anger until the day that two monks found her in a grotto, almost dead of hunger and neglect. They brought her help since she was in the pangs of labor. But when they learned who she was, burning with a sudden zeal, they took counsel and agreed to denounce her. In consequence whereof, she was questioned, and the judgement of the inquisition was pronounced and executed according to the law. Anna was burned alive at the stake with the priest Johannes and two accomplices. But Tahal, the fruit of sin, was unfortunately spared. (woman crying in pain) (screaming) He shall be called Tahal. Tahal, son of satan. - It will be a miracle if she lives through her pains. And miraculous her chastising. - I will go to get help my brother. - Elena? - Yes, this is Elena. - Help me. It hurts. Elena. - Yes Peter. - Elena. Elena please. - What is it? - Help me please. Untie me. Untie me. Please Elena. Untie me. Untie me. - That's impossible. I can't Peter. - Only a second Elena. How much I'm suffering. Help me. Untie me. (unsettling tones) (both screaming) (Peter laughing) (thunder crashes) (cries out) - Hello Father, you need me? - I'm glad you came. And I'd like you to do something. I want you to go over to see Doctor Ferry and I'd like you to ask him to come and see me as soon as possible. I've got to talk to him, it's very important. - I'll go at once Father. - Go straight there, huh? - Yes Father. - [Priest] And hurry. (peaceful organ music) - In the name of the Father, the Son and Holy Ghost. Amen. Praise be to God. - [Doctor Ferry] Good day Father. - Ah Doctor, you're here already. - [Doctor Ferry] Your messenger said it was important. - Yes, it is. And I'm very glad you're able to come. - It's a pleasure. - Take a seat Doctor. - Thank you. - I'm very worried about the case of that youngster Forti, Doctor. Something must be done about it urgently. - Yes, I know Father. It's rare to encounter a psychic phenomena. At present I can't determine what the cause of it is. - I see it from another view point. I suppose you must have heard about such phenomena as possession. - Yes, yes, of course I have. Only the arguments I've heard about it have left me rather skeptical. I feel sure that we must look for the cause in a psychic conflict. - I'm sure that this is not just a case of hysteria. I feel sure that this error in diagnosis stems from the fact that his condition does resemble hysteria. The poor child is getting worse daily, Doctor. His moments of lucidity are becoming more and more rare and moreover I hear that during his attacks his personality alters. This argues against the hypothesis that you uphold. I'm afraid this is a lot more than hysteria. It's a case of demonic possession, Doctor. - I'm a scientific man. That sounds just like the Middle Ages, when the mind boggles at it. Now I still claim that it's, um, well a case of mental hysteria, not a case of paranormal psychology. And the first thing to do for Peter Forti is to put him in a proper institution where he can get the right treatment. - I don't agree. He needs treatment of another form. You scientific men think only of scientific methods. But churchmen like us try other methods. My contention is that in an obvious case of devil possession we should try exorcism. (ship's horn blowing) (moderate dance music) - [Voiceover] Yes, there are sacred places and unholy places. God and his saints are present in the world, as are satan and his legions. It is a battle between light and darkness. As God chooses his own and not the contrary, so the devil chooses his own. In the fight between good and evil, beware of those who follow their own path. Holiness and depravity are two parallels which meet in infinity. Only the eagle can build his nest above the abyss. You speak to me satan, you challenge me. But I fear you not because I know you, because I have looked upon your face. (eerie music) (singing in foreign language) (moaning) (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] That cursed interferer. Go away, go away! (growling) Bastard scorn, stay away. Do not come in. Go. I don't want you. I don't want you. (growls) Dirty bastard. I spit upon you. Foul priest. Go lick your master's feet. Bastard. A cursed priest. (cries out) Go away you tarot troll. (Peter cries out) (clatter) (Elena screams) (speaks in foreign language) (Peter laughing) Vile sycophant. Get away. Get away from me. (Elena cries out) I cannot stand the putrid stench of your garments. Away. And you, you whore, don't ask that eunuch for help. It won't be any use. You carrying bitch, get out of here. Get out. (eerie tones) (groaning) - By the cross of Christ our savior, I summon you to come out of this boy. - [Voiceover] Go back to the mire you crawled from. You cheat. - Spirit of evil, unreason and blindness, you will return to the fires of hell from whence you came. - [Voiceover] I do not fear you, you clown. I live on your lies. Enough of this mockery. - Exorcise this demon Lord. Fight off the power of evil. Amen. (eerie tones) (Peter laughing) - [Voiceover] Heretic, talkative hypocrite. What are you trying to do? - Oh Lord of love and mercy, I invoke your holy name. Give me the strength to fight this battle against your everlasting foe. Give to me your, humble minister, the strength and the omnipotence of your power. Make to cease the torments that afflict this child. - Amen. (Peter cackling) (speaking in foreign language) (Peter cackling) You will not see the face of the Lord. You will not see him miscreant. Your banishment is for good. You'll go back to the fullness of hell. And never torment another torment of the Lord again. - Oh Lord, save him from satan. - [Voiceover] What do you hope from this ridiculous display? He will die. You know it, you know it priest. He will die. You will be to blame. Go away. (cackling) - Oh Lord, creator of heaven and Earth, who sent your son among us to save us, from the power of satan, who redeemed us by the cross on Golgotha, free us from the fiend. Free this, your servant, our brother. - [Voiceover] Eunuch priest and harlot nun, I spit on you and all your mumbo jumbo. - I order you to be silent. And in the name of the holy cross I summon you to leave this body. (Peter groaning) Return to hellfire and never come back. - [Voiceover] Stop, stop. You fool, you enemy of life. You blind prophet of ignorance. I will never leave. I shall call my legions down upon you. Hypocrite, lecher, harmonger, liar. - I banish you to the darkness. Fly to hell, I order you to do it in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, the name of him who you couldn't tempt, of him who stayed the sea, the wind and the tempest, the God of the meek-- - [Voiceover] Traitor, coward. - Who flung you from paradise to dwell in the pit of hell. - [Voiceover] Putrid excrement. (speaking in foreign language) Go away. Go away! (Peter groans) (glass breaking) - [Elena] Oh no, Peter. (Peter groans) (glass breaks) - [Voiceover] Fornicator, fornicator. (cries) - [Voiceover] Eater of excrement. Leprous swine. (glass breaking) - No, no, no! (speaking in foreign language) - Once there was a herd of swine upon the mountain. And the devils asked Jesus to let them take possession of the swine. Our Lord allowed it. (Priest's voice muffled by Elena's sobs) (groaning) (crashing) (speaking in foreign language) - [Voiceover] Go away, vile priest. - Oh Lord, help me. (Peter groaning) - [Voiceover] Carry on. I am invincible. You know it. You know I am. Off with your mask. Show yourself. Show what you really are. There are no words to describe the crimes you commit on men. Unloosen the chains of life if you dare. Put an end to this grotesque tragedy on which you base your power. You are the king of death. Say it. Say it loud. Stop appealing to fools and weaklings. You and I are the same. We are one. (Peter groaning) - [Peter] Oh my god. - Peter. Peter! - [Priest] Tremble satan. Out, vile spirit. Adversary of justice, father of death, robber of life. Prince of murderers, enemies - Peter. - [Priest] Of mankind. Hence, back into the night, God himself orders you. (Peter gasping and sighing) (speaking in foreign language) (eerie music) - Elena? - Yes, Elena. God be praised. - It was your faith that saved him. (groans) (menacing tones) - [Elena's Thoughts] So the devils besought him, saying if thou cast us out, sufferest to go away into the herd of swine. And he said go and when they would come out, they went into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters. (funky, eerie music) (thud) (sad music) - [Voiceover] Paul, Paul! What are you doing? Come on. It's time to go home. (woman laughing)
