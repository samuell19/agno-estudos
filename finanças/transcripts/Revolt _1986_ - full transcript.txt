♪ NARRATOR: Today we live in a world full of dangerous and totally destructive weapons that are capable of destroying us all, almost instantly. All civilized people share that fear. But the real number-one menace to society is drugs. Drugs don't kill as quickly, but they're deadly and they'll kill as surely as a bomb blast. Now, this scene looks innocent enough. The man is returning from a fishing trip or a pleasure cruise, but that's not what it is. He's a smuggler. The bag he's carrying is loaded with narcotics worth thousands of dollars on the open market. ♪ In spite of strong efforts by the authorities, drug trafficking continues to flourish. Not only in the United States, but all over the world. Oh, the marketplace, it can be anywhere. But usually, it's where young people gather. The sale is easier to the young and inexperienced looking for a thrill. Drug dealers continue to push their stuff to anyone with the price. And there never seems to be a shortage of buyers. There's a drug dealer arriving on that train. Ah, there he is. He's bringing in over a half of million dollars in pure poison. His target is unnatural, any educational center from grade schools to universities. This could be happening on a campus, anywhere, U.S.A. [HELICOPTER ARRIVING] Every day huge sums of money are changing hands. This supplier has a fleet of copters to feed his dealers. Who are these people? What does a drug dealer look like? No, they don't look alike but they all have one thing in common. They couldn't care less about you. They only care about the big bucks they make by distributing to every corner of the world. Such as this little town where our story takes place. [DOG BARKING] GOON: You won't cooperate, huh? [MAN GRUNTS] You gonna do it? No, you bastard! Hit him. [GROANS] Hit him harder. You gonna drive for us? Never, you bastard. -Hello. -Good morning, boss. That son of a bitch, Curtis, doesn't wanna cooperate. What? What the hell are you talking about? He's threatening to quit on you. Like hell he will. Listen, you keep working on him. I'll be right over there. Where are you going? Going down to the warehouse. GOON: Hey, here's the boss. GOON 2: Good morning, boss. [GROANS] You're a dead man, Curtis. Nobody quits on me. Do you hear me? Nobody! Boss, can I talk to you? I know a good driver who can transport the stuff. He's just looking for an opportunity like this. MACINTOSH: Can you trust him? He's done some minor jobs for me. Just who is this kid, anyway? His name is George. His brother and sister-in-law run that Persian restaurant. Just how good a driver is he? He's better than Curtis. MACINTOSH: Call him. [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello. -Good morning, Uncle George. -Yeah. -Good morning, Jeremy. -It's for you, George. -Oh. Yeah, hello. I wonder who'd be calling Uncle George at this time of day. Never mind, just finish your breakfast, Son. Yes, sir. Well, I'd be glad to do anything for you, sir. This is a big break for you, kid. We have a carload on the other side of the border waiting. You only have to drive it to this side. You can do it, can't you? Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity. You do this one, I'll get you a job permanently. I'm on my way. Hey, it's a job. I've got a job. Hey, that's great. Hey, what kind of job is it? Uh, it's, uh... Uh, delivery. Hey, I'm proud of you, George. Listen, Jeremy, uh, hurry up with your breakfast. Uncle George is gonna drop you off at school. Yeah, come on, kid. Let's go. Bring George to my office. Oh, and Lee, get rid of that garbage for good. Stupid. You heard the boss. Take him to the fields and bury him. GEORGE: See ya. Boy, who's that driver? That was my Uncle George. He's a good driver. He's a stupid driver. Don't call my uncle stupid. Anyone who drives like that near a school is stupid. Come on, Teddy. -I'm going to stay with Jeremy. -Okay. Why are women so much like women? I don't know. Maybe it's in their nature. You go that way. Stop! Stop! Stop! Get out of the car. [GRUNTS] This shipment has to arrive on time. And I don't want that old idiot Sheriff Dukes in any way, in any way, to become suspicious as to what's going on around here. That old hog? What does he know about police work? That old hog, as you call him, happens to be the man around here. And has been ever since I can remember. Why there's not a crime or scam he hasn't been up against from wetback transporting to gun running. And he's got a good arrest record. And he's clean. And we've been damn lucky up until now thanks to his deputy. Lee? There's a kid out here asking for you. Show him in, Tom. And if we get busted? Get away from the merchandise. Get rid of the kid. Well, how's my favorite driver doing today? Oh, just great Mr. D'Angelo. This is Mr. MacIntosh, George. Hello, sir. Mr. MacIntosh. You'll be driving for him today. I'd be glad to. You know, I'd do anything for you, uh, sir, Mr. MacIntosh. I was wondering if, uh, after this job is done, if I could stay around the neighborhood from now on. Give me a chance. Just one chance. That's no problem. Let's see how good you are first. Uh, you'll be satisfied, sir, Mr. MacIntosh. I assure you that. Okay, I like the kid. He's your man. Get going. Thanks. Hey, boss, that guy named Curtis got away. Curtis what? What do you mean he got away? He got away. Now, you listen to me and you listen good. -I want him back, damn it! -[GRUNTS] Find him now! Okay, boss. -You were very lucky. -[PAINED GROANS] The bullet passed in and out of the fatty part of your side. The wound is clean. The bullet only punched out a piece of your hide. You'll be all right in a couple of weeks. But, one thing is certain, you have a bullet wound and I have to inform the sheriff. No, Doc, please don't do that. I'm too involved. Wait. No, wait. Wait. They have too much on me. I'm sorry, Curtis, it's the law. I have to call the sheriff. No. Before you do that, let me tell you something that's more important. Your son-in-law's brother, George. Yes. What about George? He's going south of the border. He's gonna smuggle some dope for them. I heard he's gonna be in a lot of trouble. I'd better call Steve right away. Come on, son, lay down. Come on, now. Lay down. Please, help me leave. You're in no shape to leave. -Oh. -You know what? -Curtis, will you please stay here? -Don't worry. Take that jacket off. Come on. Don't tell anybody about... Tell anybody about my whereabouts. Don't go! [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. What? No, wait. Say it again, Doctor. Who is it? It's your father. Steve, George could be in big trouble if we don't stop him. He's driving a car filled with drugs. Oh my God. Uh, look, does he have to cross the border? Where is he now? I got the information from a man who was supposed to do the job. According to him, George doesn't know what he's doing. What's going on? What's my father saying? We'll look. Okay, thanks, Doctor. Look, I know how to get there. You call Sheriff Dukes and tell him everything you told me. Please. Okay, bye. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Sheriff Dukes. All righty. Yeah. That's right. Okay. All right, thank you. LEE: [WHOOPING] All right, we did it. [BOTH CHUCKLING] All right. GEORGE: Hey, you gonna tell the boss? You think now he'll give me a permanent job? Damn, that's the sheriff. Get in. Yeah, here. Go right. Go. It's a dead end. Let's get out of here and get going. Come on, come on. Get out. Let's go. Come on. -You go that way. -Yes, sir. Sheriff. Hey, Sheriff. Hey, Sheriff. Sheriff. Listen, listen, don't shoot. Look, look, he's just a kid. Look, let me talk to him and I'll have him turn himself in. That's what I want. Listen, where are they? Oh, God. George! George! [GROANS] [MOANS] George. [SOBS] Now, Steve, please accept our deepest sympathies. Thank you, Father. You too, Mina. Thank you, Reverend. Steve, did you ask the Father? Oh, by the way, Father, my wife and I are having a get together lunch today at our restaurant and we'd be honored if you could join us. The honor will be mine. I'll see you later. Okay. SHERIFF: Oh, Steve. I'm sorry. My condolences. Oh, thank you, Sheriff. Look, I know who killed my brother. Wasn't actually the deputy. The real killer's MacIntosh, and I intend to get him. Well, the law will take care of that. We'll get him sooner or later. I'm sure. Let me give my condolences to the Doctor and then we'll go. Doctor, please accept our condolences. Thank you, Reverend. Thank you very much. You know, Reverend, the children these days just don't seem to know what this drug scene is doing to their lives, their minds, their bodies. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello. Did you get my message? The Sheriff's starting to get suspicious. Oh, really? You better do something about Steve. I'll have to take care of him. Thank you. Oh, and by the way, Deputy, uh, after out next election you're gonna be our new sheriff. Can I count on that? Yes. [CHUCKLES] You're more than welcome. Now, I'm sure you've all heard about our famous Persian shish kabab. Right? Okay, here's our famous chef. [LAUGHS] Welcome. Welcome to our restaurant of one thousand and one nights. And this is going to be a special night. Oh, I'm sure it is, Chef. Yes. Here you are. -MAN: What the hell's going on here? -And for you. This is America. Not Iran. -Huh? -MAN 2: Yeah, he's right. Okay, okay. I'll get your orders. What do you want? I want a piece of ass. Get outta here! Right now! Both of you! Excuse me. I have to go show those two guys some manners. We want some service. Come on! Somebody! CHEF: Don't be alarmed. I'll take care of this. [CLEARS THROAT] You heard the lady. Get out or I will throw you out. Huh? Are you gonna throw me out? Yes. Excuse me. [GRUNTS] Oh. Oh. Oh. -Are you okay? -Uh-huh. Folks, just enjoy your dinner. I'll take care of this. Can I have the check, please? How 'bout some service around here? -Can I see you outside, please? -Who are you? Hey, come on. Come on. Get out of the way. Get outside. Hey, out of my way. [GRUNTS] Don't worry, Steve, I'm coming. You, take a break. You got him, Steve. Don't let him get away. Give him one for me. Okay, you son of a bitch, who sent you? Who sent you? Who sent you to my restaurant? You bastard! [GAGGING] Mac... MacIntosh. Come here. What do you want? Boss, boss, there's a guy out there. He's crazy. I tell you, he's crazy. Yeah, I know, I know. He was just mixed up. Give me that gun, Tom. Here, Pete. Hold it right there, Steve. Now, just who the hell do you think you are that you can come around here trespassing on private property. You'd have been smart to stay out of here to start with. Now about that brother of yours. He happened to be doing a job he'd been wanting to do for a long time. You know how jobs are. They all have their risks. Why should my brother and others risk their lives so you can become rich? You built an empire here at the expense of others. Youngsters, youngsters who become drug addicts because of your drug smuggling. I don't expect you to understand that, MacIntosh. Let me tell you something you will understand, I may not be able to get all of you sons of bitches, but I'm gonna bring you down. Hard. Sure you are. STEVE: Hi, Mildred. Hi, Steve. I'm sorry I couldn't attend the funeral. I was sick. I'm so sorry what happened to your brother. Are you sorry enough to tell me where Curtis is? I'm sorry. I can't tell you where he is. Look, I know how it is to lose a brother or a son. Look, I promise I won't let him get in any kind of trouble. Okay. See Tiny. Please be careful. Please don't let anyone know where he is. I won't. I promise you. Thanks, Mildred. Goodbye. It's clearing up fine. It'll be healed in no time at all. Thanks to you, Nance. You're the best nurse I ever had. You have a light touch. I'm glad you like my touch, but well, it's gonna take more than these hands to keep us going. Or this place. If you insist on continuing with your plans. I mean, I just can't figure out what you want. You're being so stupid. What do you mean? MacIntosh. I don't want you mixed up with him anymore. You tell me that was behind you. Well, it is. It's just he still owes me money, Nance. I worked a long and hard time for him doing all his dirty work. Still, I figure I still have something coming to me. Yeah, another bullet. I've never loved anyone as much as I love you, Nance. Just... [GROANS] I feel it gnawing at me. It's killing me inside. I gotta finish it. It'll finish all of us. He'll kill you. And that'll kill me. Don't you care? [GRUNTS] I just wanna try and get, get some payment of what's due. You know? That's not important. It is important. What's important is that we've got each other. -I know. -And this place. -I know. -And we're safe here. -Yeah. -Nobody knows where we are. Well, almost nobody. Tiny knows. And you trust him? CURTIS: Trust him? With my life. Well, you may have to. For all he'd have to do is make some casual remark and... -Hi, Tiny. -Hi. I'm looking for Curtis. Do you have his address? I don't have it. I don't know where the guy is. Oh, really? Can I talk to you out here for a second? Sure. -Hi. How are you? -Hi. How you doing tonight? We're a little busy. Can you, uh, stand over there for a second? Oh sure. I'll be sitting right over there, okay? Yes. Can we talk about this outside a bit? -I can't right now. I'm busy. -Oh, really? [GRUNTS] Hi. Hi. Hey, have you seen Tiny? He just went outside to talk to two guys. What guys? I don't know. Yeah. [GRUNTS] Come on, you two, get up. Come on. Let's go. Here, let me see you, Tiny. -I think you'll live. Go clean yourself up. -Okay, sure. Deputy. What's going on here? Tiny and MacIntosh's men just had a fight. -Where's Steve? -He went in the bar with Tiny. What are you doing here, Steve? Sheriff, I just came in to have a drink and there's a couple guys out there beating the crap out of Tiny. So, I jumped in and helped. I won't forget our friendship, Steve, but I can't let that stand in the way of my doing my duty. I'll arrest you as fast as I would anyone else for breaking the law. And disturbing the peace is breaking the law. Listen, only if somebody lodges a complaint. Has anyone? Well, have it your way, Steve. But I'm warning you, you stay away from MacIntosh. Leave him to me. Sure. -Tiny? -Yes, Sheriff? I don't wanna hear about any more trouble in this place, do you read me? Uh, uh, okay, Sheriff. Hey, Tiny? Yeah, Steve? I need your help. I'll do anything for you. By the way, thanks for helping me out. [CHUCKLES] Don't mention it. Tiny, I need to talk to Curtis. [SIGHS] God damn it. I'm not supposed to give that information out to anybody. But for you, I'll make an exception. Let's have a drink first. Sheriff. Deputy. Well, there it is, Sheriff. Ten thousand dollars bail money for my men. Now, get 'em out of that cage. Okay, Deputy. Sit down, MacIntosh. Now, you appear to be an intelligent man, MacIntosh. Your wife works in a local school. You gave the town a church. As local official of this county I have to protect you like I would any other person in this town. Even though it galls me. Oh now, just a minute, Dukes. I've got nothing on you, MacIntosh. Nothing that'll stick in court. But something's fishy. And I'm a stickler for things that are right and lawful. So, I'm warning you. If you or any of your cronies so much as spit, I'm running you in. Now, the local laws have statutes on the books that not even your smartass attorneys can get you off soon enough. And I don't think you'd survive even one night in our jail. You get what I mean? Just who the hell do you think you are? And who the hell do you think I am that you can talk to me like that? I happen to be a very respectable businessman. What respectable businessman runs dope? Prove it. I intend to. And I will. Believe me I will, MacIntosh. Until then, you just keep looking over your shoulder. Make one false move and I'll run you out of town. Are you threatening me? Let's just say I'm giving you some good legal advice. You can do with it whatever you want to. Meanwhile, I'll be watching. It appears to me, Dukes, that you keep forgetting who put you in that chair over there. If it wasn't for my support and votes, you wouldn't be where you are. And don't you ever forget it. Well, thanks for the votes. And the people have put me in that chair expect me to do my job, which I intend to do. You put up the bail, now get those dogs out of here. GUARD: Come on. Let's go. -Hi, boss. -Hi, boss. Howdy, men. I sure hope they treated you all right in there. -Martin. -Not bad, boss. -Jimmy. -Thanks, boss. Jerry. Tom. Boss. -Tell you what I want you to do for me, Tom. -Yeah? I want you to take all of the men down to my restaurant and order the biggest steak in the house. On me! [LAUGHS] All right. Hey, listen, don't worry about a thing. -Okay. -I'll be down there myself in a little bit. See you later, Sheriff. Deputy, thanks a lot. [GIGGLES] You can't get me. Oh! Hi, Curtis. Hi, Steve. How did you find this place? Wasn't very easy. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend? Yeah. Nancy, meet Steve. -Hi, Nancy. -Hi, Steve. Nice meeting you. Well, looks like you two need to be alone. Please excuse me. Did you hear about my brother, George? Yeah. Real sorry, Steve. Why are you here? I need your help. I'm gonna get MacIntosh. Sheriff Dukes says the only way I can put him behind bars is to get somebody like you, who knows his operations, to testify. Look, Steve, you know I informed the doctor in the hopes that what happened to George wouldn't have happened. I liked George, I really did. But I'm not... I'm just not in a position to do anything about it. I'm sorry. I really wish I could. Look, don't cop out on me, damn it! You're the only one who can help me put a stop to his operations. We gotta put him away. I need you, Curtis. I'm sorry, Steve, I just can't. What's the matter, Curtis? Can't or won't? Are you afraid of that bastard? You know, if Mac had to save his own ass, he wouldn't hesitate a second to point his finger. Are you that kind too? All you care about is your own ass. You don't give a shit about the rest of the world? You just don't understand. You just don't understand. You just don't understand, Steve. Yeah, you're right, Curtis, I don't understand. You'd better have a pretty damn good excuse because my brother was killed because of people like you and Mac bringing drugs into this country. And as far as I'm concerned, you're as guilty as he is. You just don't understand. Make me understand, damn it. It's Nancy. She's pregnant. She doesn't have anybody else in the world except for me. Her parents were killed in a car accident. Now do you understand? MINA: It was a good dinner, Dad. I enjoyed it. Mmm, you're right, Mina. One of my favorites. Doctor, you prepared that very well. No, no, no,no. Mina, your husband is the food expert. [ALL LAUGHING] Me, I'm only a surgeon. That's right. And you certainly operated on this chicken very well. Thank you, uh, Cerro. It was a fine bird. Do you want me to serve dessert in here or in the living room? I don't want no dessert. I'd rather go watch football instead. Okay. Cerro, you don't have to serve anyone. Sit down, my friend. You're my guest today. I'll do it. No, no, no. Whenever I am being served I feel like a millionaire. -But I hate millionaires. -[MAN TALKING ON TV] Dad. Hey, Dad. Something about Iran on TV. What is it, Son? Something about Americans taken hostage. Huh? What's that? What did he say? What are they saying? What are they saying? This is awful. WOMAN: It was late morning in Teheran when the mob of students stormed the embassy. The small contingent of U.S. marine guards under orders to avoid violence tried to disperse he crowd with tear gas but was vastly outnumbered. The demonstrators burned the American flag, blindfolded and handcuffed atleast some of their American hostages and paraded them in front of the embassy building. In Washington, a special State Department task force convened. Officials stress the peaceful nature of the incident so far and said the head of the U.S. Embassy in Iran was not in the building at the time of the takeover. But he assured that the Iranian government would work with us to resolve the matter. That damn Steve Brown owns that Persian restaurant. [ALL SHOUTING] MAN: [ON TV] But three million people marched through Teheran shouting, "Death to the shah." Today, they shouted, "Death to President Carter." Damn. Damn. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. Hey, boss, you see that crap those Iranians are pulling? Yeah. Yeah, that's right, Tom. I was thinking about that Persian restaurant in town and the fact that Brown's wife is Iranian we could go pay him a visit and raise some hell. That's right, honey. Tom just mentioned the fact that Steve Brown's wife is Iranian. Sure is. So's his father-in-law. The good neighborhood Doctor Bawni. [PEOPLE SHOUTING] All right, Tom, I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. MAN: [ON TV] ...sneaked out a door and into the streets and made a break for it. They were spotted by demonstrators on the roof of the building who seem to be trying to set it afire. Teddy, I don't want you playing with that Iranian boy, you hear me? It's his parents, their friends and associates who's to blame for all that. Just look at what they're doing. And another thing, I want you to tell all your friends at school tomorrow too. Okay? Can't I play with Jeremy? No. You don't need friends who cause riots and hold people against their wills. Go on to bed. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. Damn. [MAN SHOUTING] We're not going to take it anymore. America! America! ANCHOR: More than 140, mostly Iranians, arrested. [PEOPLE SHOUTING ON TV] Trouble as well at the University of Washington, in Seattle where fist fights broke out between the two sides. No one badly hurt. CROWD: [CHANTING] Go home. Go home. Go home. I don't like this. Really, do you have to watch? Look, we have to see what's going on. I don't need to watch TV to find out what's going on. I feel it when I look at the people. They resent us. Now, stop it, Mina. Look, they don't resent you or me. Not if we get away from here, Steve. I'm afraid. Afraid for you, for Jeremy. They may bomb our house next time. No, we're not running, Mina. This is my home and my country. It's your country too. And Jeremy's. But, Steve, I'm so frightened. Oh, Mina, no reason to be. America's a free country. Don't ever forget that. We've got laws to protect the common man, to protect us. We saw those laws work the last couple of days. And they did work. Look, it'll be all right. Trust me. I promise you. -Look at that guy. -Do you actually fight? [LAUGHS] What'd you tell 'em? You're a dirty half-breed Iranian. -You're a pig. -Yeah. Just shut your mouth, you guys. -Pig. -You're a dirty pig. You Iranian pig. Get him. Get him. Come on. Get off. Go on, get out. Come on, come on. He's back. -Come on. -Let's go. You stay away from that troublemaker. Don't you know what his father did to your Daddy? He's my best friend, Mom. I don't ever wanna see you playing with him again. But, Mommy? Pig! Dirty Iranian pig. [ALL SHOUTING] Dirty pig. BOY: You're a pig. You're a dirty, half-breed, Iranian pig. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello. Yes. What? My son? Oh, my God. What hospital? I'll be there. Oh, my baby. Is he all right? STEVE: Nurse, how's he gonna be? Wait. The doctor will be out to talk to you in a minute. All right? [MINA SCREAMS] God dammit, Curtis, you gotta do this. Sorry, Steve, I know how you feel. Believe me, I do. But... No, you don't know how I feel. I used to play with Jeremy. I used to hear his laughter. He's dead now. He's dead because of people like you and MacIntosh. You consider this, Curtis, consider this. You have a child on the way. Do you want people like MacIntosh around? He's scum. He pushes drugs to kids. You have a child on the way. Steve's right, Curtis. I'm worried about you, Nancy. What happens to you if something happens to me? I know what MacIntosh can do. Don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen. Every man has certain obligations. Having a wife can't keep you from your responsibilities. Go ahead. I want you to go. Okay. Okay. -Thanks, Nancy. -Mmm-hmm. Now that you've signed that statement against MacIntosh, I'll be able to get the D.A. on his tail. Well, here you go, Sheriff. Deputy. Make a copy of this, register it and send it to the District Attorney's office. Sure, no problem. Did you put your address on it? CURTIS: Yes, it's on there. Curtis, now I'm gonna have to start worrying about you. You're gonna have to watch yourself. Well, I know MacIntosh. He won't stop at anything. But as long as I stay out of his reach, I should be safe. Well, let's go, Curtis. I'll take you home. Hey, if you need any help, you know day or night, you can count on me. Well thanks, Steve, I'll probably need that. Sheriff, I know so much about that son of a bitch that you could put him behind bars for the rest of his life. Thanks, Curtis. Now, you be sure and keep in touch. Well, thank very much, Sheriff. I sure will be. Thanks, Steve, that was the right thing to do. Well, thanks, Sheriff. Look, I'll be in touch, okay? You bet. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello. Where's Mac? Let me talk to him. He's outta town, but he'll be back soon. What's happening, Deputy? Listen, write down this address. One-three-four Rosewald Road. That's where Curtis is. He gave a statement to the Sheriff. He's gonna go to court. Don't worry about it. We'll go over there and take care of this right away. He'll never see those courthouse steps. Look, do whatever's necessary. Just don't let him testify. By the way, tell Mac not to call me at the office anymore. The Sheriff's getting suspicious. I think he's on to me. Tell him just to forget me for awhile. TOM: You sure this is the place, Lee? Yeah, look at the mailbox. There's the house. Come on, you guys. Let's go. Okay, if we get this guy, Curtis, the boss is gonna make us rich. Don't worry about it. Leave him to us. We'll get that rat, okay? Okay, here's the plan. Bill, Curtis doesn't know you, so you go to the house and stay low. When he comes out, you take care of him. Lee and I will be around the back. Stay low. Okay, let's go. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Who is it? Yes. Who's there? Um, special delivery. Who's it from? Um, I can't quite make out the name. Open the door and you can see for yourself. I just got out of the shower. I'm not dressed yet. Leave it by the door. I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't do that. I need a signature. I can't. Either take it with you or leave it there. [SCREAMS] [MUFFLED YELPS] Go open the door and let Bill in. [LAUGHS] -You guys hold her while I look around. -You got her? Hey, would you look at that? Get outta here. All right. Ah, nice. Real nice. [GRUNTS] [MUFFLED CRIES] [BILL MOANS] Hey, man. Hold her down so I can get some. Okay, go for it. Hey, you two, get her into the bedroom. Okay, let's get her in the bedroom. Come on. [MUFFLED CRIES] Stay still, bitch. Steve, hold on a second. I think there's something wrong. I don't like this. -[MUFFLED CRIES] -[LAUGHS] -You got a gun? -Yeah. [MUFFLED CRIES CONTINUE] CURTIS: Nancy? Nancy? [GUNSHOT] Listen, my gun's in the bedroom. You stay here. -Oh. -You son of a bitch. Nancy! Nancy! Oh, God, Nancy. Hurry. Come on, let's go. Come on. Move it. Go. Back this thing up. Come on. Hit it. Go. No. No. Boss! Boss! Boss! We've got visitors out here and they just shot Jerry. Lee, who just shot Jerry? Lee, get your gun. You, get your gun. Come on, you guys, let's go out there and get 'em! Come on, guys. Boss, what do you want us to do? -Martin. -Yes, boss. You go to the right. Tom, you and Lee, spread out there. Robert, you go over there to the tree. Way over. Jimmy, you come with me. -Cover me, Tom. -Go. Jimmy, come here. Come here. Get over to the barn and cover me from the roof. Damn! [GUN CLICKS] [ENGINE STARTS] Freeze. Don't move. Hands in the air. Drop it. Right there. Cuff 'em, Joe. I've got dead and wounded here. I need an ambulance right away. Uh, we caught two of 'em. They say Mac's headed for the border. [SIREN WAILING]
