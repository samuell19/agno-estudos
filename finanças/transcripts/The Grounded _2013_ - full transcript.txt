>> When I was a child, my grandfather explained to me that the northern lights were caused by light shimmering off arctic ice. The scientific explanation is that they are caused by material thrown off by the sun colliding with the atmosphere of the Earth. And when it comes to the moon, I was always captivated by the fact that we can only see one side of it from Earth. The other side has only been visited and photographed from spacecraft. But the moon, like the northern lights, has a complex relationship with the earth, as does the universe. Science continues to discover more about that astounding interconnectedness, an the interconnectedness that affects the tides, the weather, the seasons, every aspect of life we take for granted, right down to the blood in our veins. The forces of nature, no matter how seemingly random, from storm clouds and lightning to blowing snow and high winds, ultimately determine our well-being. All of nature's forces gift the surface of the earth with subtle energy. All we have to do is touch it and become truly alive. [MUSIC PLAYING] >> Welcome to "The Power of Natural Healing" with Howard Straus. >> We have Clint Ober. Now, Clint Ober started out his career writing on the rising popularity of cable television, but he wasn't very happy. And from that dissatisfaction, from that unhappiness with his personal achievement and his goals and his-- what he felt like he was doing for the world, he has made one of the most significant health discoveries of all time. >> Pretty far-fetched, I thought, but something to consider while dealing with the cold reality of the day. 35-below wind chill. Does the sink work? 20-below zero sitting overnight, couldn't use this. Oh, dear. But the more I thought about that internet show with its elevated message, perhaps there was some truth to it-- greatest health discovery ever. OK. When you're in physical pain like I was, you tend to look closer at your options for some kind of relief. This was a winter like no other. 44 feet of snow fell in total. There's a reason why I feel crappy today, yeah? >> Oh, can you help me carry some pieces of firewood? >> The workload was daunting and unrelenting. My back muscles kept me in agony. My frozen hands stayed numb. Here's a fence. It's an 8-foot high fence, but as you can see-- I take care of orphaned wildlife. Their lives fare much better in the brutal season compared to their wild counterparts. You might have wondered what that greatest health discovery pronouncement made on that internet show was. It is called earthing, which refers to the recent uncovering of the fact that major health benefits result from contact with the Earth's energy field by walking barefoot. Wearing conductive footwear, such as leather, also works. But because I was desperate, I went for the whole treatment, from head to toe, regardless of the temperature. After about 20 minutes of lying naked on the bare earth in below-freezing temperatures, a wave of calm had come over me. And I felt warm and tingly. The next morning something was missing. It was the pain in my back, and both of my hands were no longer numb. This was crazy. How could this have occurred? Was it my imagination? Did I simply tell myself the pain would go away if I touched the earth, and by doing so, it would? I decided to try a different method. Of course, I didn't want to stay connected to the earth by lying outside in the cold. Since earthing or grounding is all about soaking up the earth's free electrons. All I needed to do was stick a grounding rod into the earth and bring the energy right into the cabin. And while I was at it, why not start an experiment to see if this magic works on other living things. And so I also cut two sprigs of a cottonwood sapling, grounding one and not the other to see if it would influence the sprouting of the buds. This, I thought, would be the litmus test. But, hey, why stop with cottonwood trees. It was almost Valentine's Day, and my helper, Rocky, delivered ideal additional specimens for my experiment. >> Thank you. >> I put the first batch of lilies in the new workshop edition, which were not grounded to the earth and even added the stuff that comes with store-bought flowers to give them a longer shelf life, the other batch for the grounding experiment. But the next morning after sleeping grounded, something else was happening. I noticed I wasn't grinding my teeth in my sleep anymore either. Things started coming into focus rapidly after that. The cottonwood sprig that was in the grounded vase sprouted before the other one. And then the verdict was in between the grounded and ungrounded lilies. Guess which lily kept its pedals the longest? The grounded, lily, of course. All the ungrounded lilies in the new workshop edition had long been dead. It is a moment like this that you just want to jump on your snow machine and get to the first person you can think of who is suffering, who might really take you seriously. That person was my associate, Mario Benassi, and then my helper, Rocky, caught an internet discourse between two celebrity doctors about this earthing discovery. >> I gotta say-- I think a lotta folks will say this is where Dr. Mercola, he fell off the wagon on this one. What? Who's doing this? And who gave you this idea? >> Well, it's because-- it's not simply walking barefoot. It's walking-- the devil's in the details. It's walking barefoot on the earth. And the earth is a massive source of free electrons. and when you do that, these electrons go into your body. >> So my mother-in-law has been torturing me about this. She's been talking about walking barefoot outside, which I thought was just a scam to get me out of the house. >> Meantime, my associate Mario had some news. >> I didn't really think it was true. I didn't want to believe it at first. >> But it's the truth. He hasn't been snoring for the last three nights. >> Now I don't hear him snore at all. >> After an initial email, Clint Ober, the man who discovered grounding or earthing for modern man, contacted me. I explained to him how many people I knew were suffering in our community. He responded with this box. From then on, all he had to do was disseminate information and put together resources to anyone I knew that would benefit. Word's getting out. Tim, are you there? Now, you're in pain, ay? >> I am, always. >> What's the matter? >> Ruptured disc. >> So you're in always pain. >> Always. >> Take this. Hi, you're here. So I just bumped into you. Local business owners took this seriously. My reputation and hunch about grounding was now open to public scrutiny. Either this was going to change the community of Haines, Alaska, or I'd be the laughingstock of the town. Alaskans, it seems, are skeptical by nature and quite opinionated to boot. >> Show me a better way; I'll do better. >> I'm saying, Steve, that you should just take this thing and run with it and get it out to the public as fast as possible to as many people as possible. >> So a concept I hadn't considered-- so whether it makes sense or not, who's to say? But I did crawl underneath the house and get naked and lay on the earth for about 20 minutes, and I felt better. Why would the local doctor be so underwhelmed by this? Uh-oh, something happened here. >> [INAUDIBLE] and I'll tell you how dang good I feel without any back problems whatsoever. >> Really? Has your back gotten better? >> I have absolutely no pain in my back whatsoever. >> And how long have you had this back pain prior to meeting on this earthing thing? >> 20 years. Day to day was a struggle. >> Oh, my goodness. >> Every day was a struggle to get through. Oh, we got in the truck. Well, the wolf will like that. >> Almost everyone was being transformed, some, literally overnight. So I placed calls with people at NASA for support in making this film. >> Hey, Steve [INAUDIBLE] I try to not get involved in any way with things that I don't understand, I don't really know what to think about them. So I just can't do it. I hope that this turns out to be a breakthrough. Good luck to you, Steve. >> Stop. I got a message from an astronaut. He turned me down. He said it's too crazy. What do you think? Should I give up? >> No. >> Why? Nobody's going to believe this. >> Believe what? >> Believe that this works. >> Well, he's not the only person in the world. >> Well, he's a man to walk on the moon. He's pretty important. >> So just because he turned you down doesn't mean that are people won't believe in it. >> Nobody believes in this stuff much you get a famous person to talk to and at least give their opinion, don't you think? >> No. It's the everyday Joe that's going to need this more than you guy that's got millions of dollars. >> I've been a filmmaker for 30 years, mainly for the likes of National Geographic. If there ever was a film that I needed to make about nature, this one was it. We started to do more research and met earthing advocates including Clint Ober himself. >> [INAUDIBLE] is laying on the earth, just laying down on the earth. You don't have to be naked. You're touching the earth. If you can take your shoes off, that's great. It's like, no amount of Advil or Motrin or Aleve can do the anti-inflammatory power that the earth can. >> I'm using part of my parka here so we can see you. >> I don't know, is my coat sliding down on-- >> It's just the connection's just barely there. >> OK, barely there. All right, if a raven flies by and sits on a branch in the hemlock right here it's going to-- I'm going to lose you. Our first Skype meeting with earthing discoverer, Clint Ober and assistant Dr. Christy resulted in another shipment of boxes of information and resources to continue to ground our hometown. The deeper question needs to be asked. >> If there is a message at all about earthing, it really is-- it's not about bed pads and wires and all that kind of stuff. It's more about our connection with nature, with the planet, with the universe. You know, we invented plastics in '57, I think Dupont. And it started entering the market in the '60s. The first thing we did with plastics is we put them on the soles of our shoes. >> It always amazes me how much insight and wisdom can be deciphered from observing nature. This wold I live with named Isis was also raised with the help of my veterinarian, Dr. Vic Walker. Until this moment, Dr. Walker had no knowledge of what was happening regarding earthing and my involvement with it. >> >> They have powerful jaws, don't they? They're barefoot, essentially. You're my vet, veterinary-- sanctioned by the state of Alaska to look over the animals here and everything. You love this wolf? >> Oh, yes. >> At this moment, Dr. Walker revealed the chronic pain and stress his wife was currently going through. So she deals with inflammation and pain, is that right? >> Yes. >> Give her this. >> What's this, Steve? >> Not a day went by that I wasn't amazed with reports from people in our town. As hints of spring began to become evident, I kept a close eye on the snow lines for the first opportunity to become emancipated from footwear. With the longer days and warm winds, one of the family decided to suddenly wake up after months of hibernation. Her name is Kitty, a five-year-old grizzly bear, orphaned as a cub and given to me by the state of Alaska to take care of for the rest of her life. Here's another creature gifted with the extension of the senses we seem to have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. The weakening of the bear also awakened something in me, something that said how beautiful the natural cycle of life is, how precise rhythmic patterns of the earth work, and how the hum of the earth is in sync with the moon and the forces beyond that, how beautiful it all is. [MUSIC PLAYING] And this is where this film takes another turn. While tossing frozen salmon out of the freezer for the bear, I realized that my assistant was right. The astronaut that turned down involvement on this movie project was not the only human to set foot on the lunar surface. 12 of them did. And now two were suddenly willing to contribute their time to this movie. We were set to meet on a Florida beach. By the time I arrived with the film crew in Cape Canaveral, Florida, it all became dreamlike. It was here where I was going to meet Laura Koniver, a medical doctor who was going to help with these interviews. >> There's three rooms under Richard Smith. >> Richard Smith? Would you like a grounded or non-grounded room? >> What? >> Smoking or non-smoking? >> Oh, non-smoking. >> The film crew couldn't resist letting the hotel receptionist in on the subject matter of this documentary. But it did plant a seed of an idea in my mind to share with the motel owner back in Alaska. A far cry from my first earthing experience, there was a very comfortable way for civilized people to receive the same earth energy in the form of a conductive bed sheet. Life's an adventure. So I went out-- But who do I have to thank for this chance introduction? None other than our beloved rooster Squawkee Laura was about to help me meet two people with a unique perspective about the Earth. >> [INAUDIBLE] Dr, Mitchell, I know that you experienced a really intimate moment where you felt interconnected with everything, even in space. >> OK. There was no script for this shoot and, of course, none of this was staged. I had my film crew from National Geographic, Laura, and her family, and a strong desire to document different perspectives about the earth, its healing power, and the interconnectedness of all life therein. >> And I remember I watched you describe a moment where this just hit you, just washed over you. You had this moment where you felt interconnected to not just the earth, but the stars, everything. >> That's exactly-- experiencing that particular phenomena. I didn't know what to call it at that point. Cultures are rooted in this type of a unity experience. It says everything is all interconnected. >> Here's a gift for you. >> And after listening to what Dr. Mitchell shared and before we ran out of time, I had one chance to give him the same tools for connecting to the earth just like everyone back home. >> 1130-- >> Laura was now speaking with Charlie Duke, the 10th man to walk on the moon on Apollo 16 and the director in Houston to guide Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong to become the first man to walk on the lunar surface. >> Mode control both auto -- Descent override command - Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed. >> OK, they want to know, how excited were you when you met your first footstep on the moon? >> Well, I was like a little kid. >> Charlie Duke also did this interview barefoot. He too understood that the ground beneath our feet is a natural treatment table for what ails us. He saw it all as intelligent design. >> Now I look back on my adventure, and there's a psalm that says the heavens declared the glory of god and the skies proclaim the works of his hand. And it is not an accident. It is not a chance. It's just an orderly universe that we see. And the planets and their forces and the stars and all of the physical laws that are so repeatable over and over and over, and I see god's hand in that. >> Laura had a deep knowledge of how grounding works. She had no reservations in inviting you back to her home in Charleston, South Carolina to explain all this. It was in Dr. Koniver's home that I could see her vision and understanding about how earthing works and what it can do for humanity. But then she didn't stop there. It seemed there was this inner drive to suggest this comprehensive healing modality through her many painted creations, so profound, yet so simple that even a preschooler could comprehend. Dr. Koniver was very much aware of the scientific research conducted over the past 15 years on earthing. She believes the future of health care will be vastly different for her children because of it. Before I left, she agreed to do more research on earthing with her own patients. Arriving home, I was relieved that my assistant, Rocky Seward had kept everyone happy. In my hometown, there continued to be profound and life-impacting reports. At the Eagle Foundation, for example, there was Dave Olerud, who had been a paraplegic for 30 years in a state of unimaginable suffering, barely able to twitch his toes until now. He had only been grounded a month. [MUSIC PLAYING] >> Thanks for the moose branches. >> You're welcome. >> You're going to help me-- what's that? >> That's grounding things from a lady, she feels bad because she-- too well, or she'll loose her disability. It's OK? >> But then there was Rocky himself, a man who lives a hard life and sort of is homeless, who sleeps in his truck each night until I invited him to stay with me in the cabin. [SNORING] There was no way I would ever get a good night's sleep with that type of situation happening on the couch 4 feet away from my bed. The next night Mr. Seward agreed to allow me to hook him up to the earth in an experiment. He had nothing to lose, really, since he'd never gotten a true night's sleep anyway due to waking up choking and with a headache and more. You guessed it. He never snored again. [MUSIC PLAYING] >> My associate Mario rendezvoused with me at a street corner in Vancouver to meet this host. His name is Dr. David Suzuki, but who is he, really? >> He's probably one of the most well-known scientists of our age. He's a national hero in Canada. And he's probably one of the most eminent ecologists that people recognize. >> Do you think I should tuck my shirt in? >> Yeah, maybe. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> Hi. Glad to meet you. >> I've been following you since I was a little kid. >> Where are you now? >> Well, I live in Alaska. >> In Alaska. >> Outside of Haines, Alaska. And this is Mario Benassi. >> Hi. >> --an associate of mine. >> Nice to meet you. >> We used to shoot for PBS and all these different things, nature shows. Between the two of us, I don't think we've ever been so tongue-tied to meet you. >> Come on. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> Come on. Let's go out there. >> OK, you lead the way. >> So you haven't visited this place? >> I have never been here-- I explained to Dr. Suzuki how our town was benefiting from earthing and asked if he thought reconnecting to the Earth's energy field would be beneficial. >> Absolutely. We need to be connected with the earth, which gave us birth. The moment I was born, I needed a breath of air, as did everyone else and from that time, to the last breath we take before we die, we need air 15 to 40 times a minute. That's nature, man. We take air into our bodies. We fuse with it and pump it through our system. We are air. We are water. 70% of my body is water, for heaven's sakes. And we leak it all the time through our skin and our eyes and our nose and our crotch. And we lose water, and we have to keep topping up. That water comes from all over the world. We are a part of nature. That's what we are. But we think that we've grown so smart and that we can actually pump nature up and get it to yield even more. Cut the trees down. We'll genetically modify and genetically alter trees so they grow faster. Of course, the quality of the wood is crap. But we think that we can grow trees as if they're corn or tomato plants, which is absurd, of course. We have now become the most numerous mammal on the planet, but we're not like wildebeest or mice or caribou. We are endowed with huge amounts of technology, a consumptive appetite that is insatiable, and we are trashing the planet as a result. And we're trashing our home. It's our home. >> We were fortunate enough on this journey to meet historian Freddy Silva who clearly understood the earth's energy fields from the perspective of the intuitions of ancient people. >> What is it that you are doing that brought you out to the West Coast here of Canada? >> I work with ancient systems of knowledge. I'd look at and research how the ancestors worked and build temples around the world, look at the ways in which they develop common attitudes to developing consciousness and then find that there are commonalities between these points of view that are shared by different cultures around the world. >> Mr. Silva pointed out that earthing is not a new discovery, just a rediscovery of what the ancients already knew would help them to heal. I was now literally connected to the earth almost 24/7. The remarkable way I was being affected made me ponder that most people in modern societies are almost never in direct contact with the Earth's surface. No wonder so many people walk around fat, sick, and nearly dead. Sometimes nothing prepares us for the devastating stress and emotional upheavals that can lay claim to your life. The first thing grounding does is calm the nervous system. It soothes the left side of the brain and synchronizes the right and left brain. Where I found pain relief was to do what the ancients did, immerse myself unclothed into the earth. It's like throwing bucket of water on a fire as opposed to using just a cup. More exposed skin allows the earth's electrons to flow into one with much more volume and intensity. An event was taking place now. It involved grounding 1,000 people all at the same time during a 70-minute presentation organized by Clint Ober, the discoverer of earthing for modern man. First, there was Carrol Alt who spoke about body care. And with that comes the realization for millions of women that earthling is the holy grail for beauty care. But the main event was Dr. Christy who, upon taking center stage, would instruct everyone to begin grounding themselves during her talk. >> And so we're going to get started. Are we hooked up to the earth up here? >> Yes. >> We've got Earth. OK, so it's time to take off our shoes. [INAUDIBLE] in a moment. >> As Clint Ober observed this group, he looked confident that it wouldn't take long for grounding to affect everyone in the room. >> We're going to have a good time. >> I was nowhere near prepared for the number of people that were affected by being grounded that came back and wanted to talk to me. How do you interview almost 1,000 people? >> It's such a simple and so profound and powerful concept, and it's right there beneath our feet. This is what just blows me away. I've been writing about health for 35 years. >> I got a call from the state of Alaska. Another orphaned animal-- this time, a baby moose. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> Because she was likely a mere 48 hours old, I had to keep her safe from hungry wild grizzlies. And so I put her in a bear-proof horse trailer with the door shut temporarily. I named her Karen. Because the horse trailer kept Karen ungrounded, I devised a way to reconnect this moose calf to the Earth with a grounding pad. She instinctively knew where to lie down, whether it was concealed or not. The next step was an exercise in reality having to do with true nutrition. This moose primarily needed raw milk with all the live enzymes. If it was pasteurized, she would likely die. Yet, I'm amazed that people are told there is no difference at the grocery store. The flow of people to my porch wanting to be grounded never let up, and word continue to spread. By the time the daisies were in bloom, I was elated with the return of my son Garrett from his work down south. Garrett and his 19-year-old girlfriend Esther were somewhat aware of earthing, but wanted to learn more. I would show them. It was just a matter of time. The plants themselves had something to say about earthing. More and more people in our town wanted to be grounded. It was overwhelming. Garrett and Esther were now part of the team. I wanted to make an impression on these two kids and collect as many plants as I had room for the replicate and verify. I just laid back and watched. If grounding is all a placebo effect in humans, then the results with plants would be pretty black and white, I thought. Vegetation can't lie. [MUSIC PLAYING] Inspired by the moose calf's natural connection to the earth, I found myself going barefoot most of the time too. I felt like a kid again. [MUSIC PLAYING] As time passed, my veterinarian, Dr. Walker, returned with his family. By now, even he had experienced what earthling had rendered. By this time, in town, my assistant Rocky Seward was called to help replace a sign. An official declaration to our entire community and beyond, the first motel in the nation to offer overnight accommodations grounded. On the other side of the continent, Dr. Laura Koniver also had studies underway. Her interviews with the Apollo astronauts gave her inspiration. They too were running trials with plants-- >> Y'all come on back now. >> --while simultaneously conducting earthling trials with patients. >> Tell me how the study went for you? >> The main reason I wanted to do this was because anytime you say oh, walk outside in your bare feet in this way, that would be awesome. >> I have loved the study. >> I noticed that I was sleeping better. I had a deeper sleep. >> And now, long term, I don't have pain at all anymore. >> I can't say enough how much of a difference this has made in my life. >> Laura's children took these patient results in like they were multiple miracles. And the lab results stunned everyone. Then, renowned cardiologist Dr. Stephen Sinatra heard of the study. >> Well, never before, in the history of humankind, we have to ground. >> Laura Koniver continued to email all of us, particularly, my son Garrett and his girlfriend Esther. It caused these kids to question everything, everything from the food we eat, to the drugs people take, to what they were taught in science class in high school, and above all, why we all wear rubber-soled shoes. Grounding soon caught the attention of outsiders like a film crew that we're working on an episode for "National Geographic." The show's host took a particular interest in what happens to plants. I pointed out clinical case studies online with the geographic team of the seemingly miraculous disappearance of chronically inflammation in patients verified by thermography, which distinctly depicts reduction in inflammation through color temperatures. As for Garrett and Esther, it was time to whet their appetites. [MUSIC PLAYING] This phenomena is bigger than all of us. Beyond the greatest health discovery ever, it may encompass much, much more. [MUSIC PLAYING] The curiosity of these two kids now led them on a quest just like me. I agreed to support their research wherever that might take them. Garrett and Esther learned that the ancients had a clear comprehension of the earth's subtle electrical fields and the planets negative charge. Gothic cathedrals were oftentimes built exactly upon energy hotspots. All of these sites whether conical mounds or stone circles were built with impressive precision rivaling any technology we possess today. [MUSIC PLAYING] The architectural design that was implemented in building Gothic cathedrals was carefully planned out with the purpose behind it all. It was to harness and channel sort of earth energy directly down corridors and spaces. In 2008, when NASA announced that the earth is linked to the sun by a network of magnetic portals, they essentially validated the ancient temple builders who sourced these very flux events on the land and their connection beyond our terrestrial sphere. [MUSIC PLAYING] Then I was determined to meet someone who could infuse insight, answers, and hope. Jon Stuart Reid brought me to an ancient stone circle site called Long Meg and Her Daughters, which is considered one of the largest stone circles in the UK next to Stonehenge. It is in this cow pasture where John and I began some analysis of the breadth and width of these individual stones and their formational link to the earth's energy. These stones, put here thousands of years ago along with their inscriptions, have weathered the test of time. What were these ancient secrets? I was about to find out. Experiments are conducted inside a special room called the Faraday cage. It is in this environment where studies take place with instruments such as the cymascope, which uses a few drops of water to manifest frequencies. >> It's an audio oscillator. And we're going to set it to the Schumann cavity resonance of 7.83 hertz. >> The frequency of the earth, it has never been seen before like this. This heartbeat occurs in the spherical cavity between the surface of the earth and the ionosphere. It's almost as if the universe is trying to tell us something, perhaps, synchronicity. The brains of all creatures, including humans, are tuned to this frequency and this pattern, simply with water and light. The frequency of the earth made visible for the first time ever-- yet the same design carved in rocks thousands of years earlier. The world's top mathematicians are now extrapolating mathematical equations from this sacred geometry. [MUSIC PLAYING] Then I heard about a teenage girl named Rae Heim who was running barefoot coast to coast. I wanted to cheer her on. If successful, she would become the youngest and only female who ever ran across America, not to mention doing it barefoot. The odds were against her. She was running to raise awareness of children who live in poverty. Because of the oppressive heat and drought conditions ray was running through, I thought the best place to meet would be where there was both shade and free energy. Rae had no idea why I chose a sunflower field to meet in. She was running on asphalt most the time, which is nonconductive. And since the soil was so parched, it was also nonconductive. However, Rae could receive earth energy if all she did was touch one thing. The roots of the sunflower went deep into the earth. And so the moist stem was essentially a grounding rod, giving Rae earth's power. Now aware of the secret, Rae was gifted with an itch. [MUSIC PLAYING] Back home in Alaska, earthing was now the talk of the town. And for many who didn't want to go barefoot for various reasons, there was a solution. By drilling holes in shoes and sandals and inserting a conductive plug, the earth's energy could go back up into the foot-- next best thing to barefoot. And then, a lady from New York heard above what was happening in our town. She knew that not everyone would want to wear grounded sandals. She had options-- grounded shoes. >> They're wonderful. >> Well, I'm kind of-- the kind that think that it's not going to work. >> No, I think the science is really indisputable about the benefits. So these are a 7. >> There are very good reasons to think that this may very well be the most important health discovery ever, and it's something you all need to know about. Electrostatics is a branch of physics. And it teaches us that when two conductive objects make contact, if they have different electrical potential, they equalize virtually instantaneously. You may know that penicillin was a revolution in medicine. This is a revolution in health care that I think transcends penicillin. >> Dr. James Oschman studied at the Marine biological laboratory under Nobel Prize winner Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, the biochemist who did research of electronic biology in the '80s. Dr. James Oschman responded to all the questions that Esther and Garrett sent him. He emailed information and illustrations, which quantified and verified the scientific research, including the double-blind placebo studies and the clinical trials that were conducted over a period of 15 years. How beautiful to know and, yet, how tragic to realize that much of humanity has never heard of grounding. [MUSIC PLAYING] Because of profound effects that earthling has on women of all ages, Dr. Laura Koniver would email Esther and Garrett pictures she painted that spoke in subtle detail of this fact. Children who practice earthling that have been studied have been shown to have profound reductions in physical and emotional issues. One study of 28 parents of autistic children found a dramatic change in behavior and communication skills after grounding the children only two months. And then I had an opportunity to visit my parents in Minnesota. And both of my parents had health issues that recently were miraculously wiped away by earthing. If earthing worked for them, it was a strategy that would know no boundaries of age, race, color, or creed or circumstance. [MUSIC PLAYING] At the urging of my parents, I flew to nearby Chicago where there was another advocate of earth thing who is known to millions of people around the world. This is a doctor who does not accept conventional medicine at face value and who successfully shines a light on true healing and environmental sustainability. Not surprisingly, living grounded is something this man had been doing for the past eight years. It's hard to believe, isn't it? >> It is. >> His name is Dr. Joseph Mercola, the physician that we had seen in February on a show discussing groaning with Dr. Oz. >> Do you go barefoot a lot? >> Most of the time, except for when I'm driving or have to do a professional video shoot. >> My cab driver looked like he already knew that this ancient wisdom. I'm going to listen to some of our callers comments here, again, OK? You want to hear them too? >> OK. >> There's a famous German philosopher. His name is Arthur Schopenhauer, and he already had a comment about truth, which is really quite amazing, I think, most appropriate to when we're considering a topic like grounding. And his statement was, "It is ridiculed, then it becomes violently opposed, and then finally becomes widely accepted as self-evident." What do you think about Dr. Mercola's viewpoints on walking barefoot. >> My grandparents say all the same things. Walking on the grass is very healthy, especially your heart. >> In this journey, if that's what you could call it, I know noticed within myself a renewed sensitivity about the subtle details of nature, the flow of the seasons, the dance of life. And when it came to personal emotions about the affairs of the heart, a stronger belief in the ultimate power of love, and the value of patience and understanding, and their ability to operate on faith emerged. Everyone around me seemed happier. Now I could see patterns never noticed before, from the basic designs of a beehive to the arrangement of leaves and seeds of a sunflower, to the mathematical consistencies of the design of everything. Nothing was random. >> It's more about our connection with nature, with the planet, with the universe. >> Cultures are rooted in this type of a unity experience. It says everything's all interconnected. >> It's not an accident. It's not a chance. It's just an orderly universe. >> An orderly universe, all right, even within our bodies-- to many people, earth energy remains abstract. But what if I could document the rate at which red blood cells travel after a subject is grounded for a mere two hours? It's a scientific visual. It's a fact that blood thins significantly when one is grounded. Thus, earthing becomes a major factor in battling heart disease. As I flip the switch for the blood to be influenced by a controlled DC electric field, we could now see the difference of blood velocity before and after two hours of earthing. As you can see under controlled conditions of the DC current, the blood cell velocity is unequivocal before and after earthing for two hours. Dr. Gary Schwartz, along with Dr. Christy oversee these studies at the University of Arizona. I followed Dr. Christy to another research facility in Southern California to meet Dr. Gaetan Chevalier, a biophysicist and electrophysiologist. Dr. Chevalier, along with his colleagues, have spent almost 15 years in trials and studies of everything, ranging from sleep studies, skin conductivity, cortisol levels, stress and tension studies, heart rate variability studies, and many other published physiological parameters that are relevant to everything. On Skype, Garrett and Esther we're looking for international opinions and comments on the subject of earthing. >> I'm Pawel Sokal. I am a physician. I'm a neurosurgeon. >> All of us were processing this information together and thinking about so many we love that are suffering because they don't know about this. In Seattle, Washington, where Esther and Garrett were now attending college nearby, they took part in a race where shoes were shunned called the naked 5K. I found it rather odd though that, although it was a barefoot race, it seemed like the barefoot runners were still in the minority. The footwear industry is a $55 billion a year force. And the idea that running barefoot is far superior to high-tech foot gear is not something industry will espouse publicly. [MUSIC PLAYING] There was a biker cameraman at this event, however, that told us of a race done in central Mexico that makes any other marathon pale in comparison. He invited us to his home to see what he documented. This filmmaker's name is Sterling Noren. And Sterling wanted to show us story and proof of the Tarahumara Indians he follows. They live in a remote canyon in central Mexico. And they're able to run superhuman marathon distances of up to 250 miles. No one on earth can match their endurance. And many observers attribute their capability to the simple fact of living barefoot. [MUSIC PLAYING] Garrett and Esther gave me clarity of what earthing really is. Earthing or grounding is foundational physics. Its power for eliminating inflammation and helping to defeat everything from heart disease to carpal tunnel syndrome to sleep apnea is mind blowing. But this energy medicine suggests something universal. I followed the intuitions of these two kids to Maui, to the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Curiously, after a 20-minute cab ride listening to these kids, our driver was in no rush to put his shoes back on either. Dr. JD Armstrong took it from there, bringing us higher and higher above the clouds and away from the light pollution of the city of Kahului down below to the Haleakala Observatory where some of the world's most powerful telescopes peer through the portals of the universe and reap data that is transmitted to NASA, to governments, to institutions worldwide. To understand why or how grounding works at all, we have to comprehend why or how the earth has a negative charge to start with. [MUSIC PLAYING] It all has other-worldly explanations. It involves space itself and the sun and the moon and the weather and lightning and the Earth's core and how it's all interconnected. And to look into this deeper, one has to wait a while. [MUSIC PLAYING] What this 30-ton telescope sees out there and what is millions of light years away are images that show up on banks of computers. What this information conveys depends upon who you are. [MUSIC PLAYING] For Esther, what she saw incomprehensibly infinite space was the same thing in the design of Garret's ear, a fractal, a spiral, a sequence. In fact, the spirals in space and the spirals found in the outer and inner ear and elsewhere are all the same. They are an exact mathematical equation. It is called the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence. In other words, sacred geometry-- it's on your face, your hands, and everywhere. But not everyone agrees. >> Intelligent design is horseshit. First, let me ask you, what's your view on intelligent design, then I'll tell you mine. >> When the Institute's Dr. Ritter learned we were making a film about earthling, he called us in for a talk. Dr. Ritter had never heard about earthing before. The fact that these two kids were poking around and speaking with the staff about the merits of connecting to the earth bothered him. After all, Garrett and Esther were not scientists. What do they know? >> Do you think connecting to the earth with our skin is important or can help your body? >> I don't really understand the question. >> No shoes or socks on, bare skin against the earth-- do you think that's beneficial? >> I haven't read these studies that you're asking about, so I'm not going to answer that. >> Should I explain a little bit first? >> You took the questions out of sequence. >> Oh, well, I said it goes from the bottom up. I can read the top one first. >> I'm a physicist. We study the nature of matter, the interaction of matter, and what the rules are of the govern that. We see four forces in nature, gravity, strong force, weak force, and electromagnetism. Is the earth connected to other things? Sure, we feel the gravity of the moon that fills the gravity of my telephone right here and vice versa. Is the earth connected because of these things? Yes, we understand that in physics. Are you talking about something else? >> When you do connect your body with the earth, there is scientific evidence that shows the inflammation in the body is decreased because, basically, the electrons from the earth go into your body and decreases the inflammation. >> What is the result of these "scientific" studies? >> To welcome scientific debate of this undeniable phenomenon will only ultimately give earthing more power. It is a threat to the status quo, but are we able to assure our children of a future if change does not occur? We are immersed in an environment that is not conducive to health or even a society that is sustainable. Are we leaving our children with an irreparable legacy? >> Since I was born in 1961, the use of toxic plastics has skyrocketed and so have an epidemic of ills. Surely, we will turn this around. And when Garrett is my age, the planet will be a much cleaner place. But is this just a dream? These kids needed some hope. I knew just who to see. But before our guest arrived, I had a time of reflection. [MUSIC PLAYING] It was at this moment that I realized that if I had known about birthing years ago, the mother of my son would still be in this world. But for many other women of Haines that gathered in our workshop, the future is indeed bright. >> I grew up in Angoon, Alaska. And in Angoon, we, as a village, as a culture, believe that we have to be good to the earth and respect the earth, most importantly, so that the earth will be good to us. >> The first five months of my pregnancy with Maya, I was extremely sick. And I was introduced to this grounding. >> As for the people in the town of Haines-- >> I was born with spina bifida. And Rocky came up here and was telling me about this grounding thing. And he went ahead and gave me a couple of the patches, and I put them on my feet. I tell you what, I sure started sleeping better at night. I hurt my shoulders probably seven years ago. I pulled both of my rotator cuffs. >> And now it's different? >> And now it's different. I used to not be able to just reach up. I used to have to go like this and just gingerly put my arm up, and I can-- >> And so you've gotten lots of comments about this earthing room here at your motel, right? >> Yes, indeed. >> And some people, what happens to them? Do they call you again, want to come here? >> Sure, yeah, they'll call us back. And if they're traveling through the community again, they come back and will stay in our motel so that they can access this room again. >> What are they feeling when they stay here? >> Relief from back pain, relief from arthritis type pain, just a good comfortable sleep, those kinds of things. >> Here, I'm going to give you this journal. We have to start keeping records of this. >> You remember the skeptical doctor in Haines who thought that earthing was anecdotal. 12 months later, he's more perplexed than ever about what's happening in town. And now an official dinner was being planned for some very special guests. I met up with these guests at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. It was Dr. Christy and astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell. But by the time we landed in Juneau, Alaska, a storm was brewing, and all flights to our hometown were canceled. The only other alternative to get home was a sketchy ferry ride. [MUSIC PLAYING] No amount of cold and snow or storms could cancel this event. There was one slight, last-minute problem, however. Remember the Eagle's Nest Motel, first the nation to offer an earthing room? Well, they were sold out-- no vacancy. No room for Edgar and Dr. Christy and Jason, her assistant, to stay. Too many people had come to town to meet Edgar and Christy. The only other option was my place. I was not prepared for that. [MUSIC PLAYING] When Dr. Mitchell asked, is there plumbing in there as a joke, well, no, there really wasn't. All the pipes were frozen. Ironically, it all started to feel familiar. I really was home again. >> We have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times as long as the Atlas, which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalence to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerator on the floor. [MUSIC PLAYING] >> It wasn't long before everyone discovered that we had more in common than we could have realized. >> So I'll show you, this is that the sunflower experiment that we're doing with Gary Schwartz. >> Is this a wire that's connecting them? >> Yeah, it's a wire, and there's a mesh. And it becomes really distinct over time. This poor little sunflower that's not connected starts to wither and wilt, and the one that's connected to the earth is still vibrant and strong. It seems to me, when I look at this, that the earth itself has this energy to give every living creature. Well, it certainly would suggest that, certainly would suggest that. >> Yeah. >> As the Atlas, which launched John Glenn. >> And so now we are at the moment of the hour. It's such a privilege to be able to introduce to you Apollo 14 astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell. [APPLAUSE] >> There is a saying in one of the traditions [INAUDIBLE] they said, let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me. It has been what I have worked for since I came back from the moon. To help we, as humans, learn to live with each other and for each other and create for ourselves and our planet and our progeny, a sustainable civilization. And we aren't there yet. We've got a log of work to do, but what we can do it. And I have devoted my life to it. Because the experience that I had coming back from the moon has been shared by most astronauts that may not be exactly described in the way I describe it. But nevertheless, it's what's called the overview effect of seeing this magnificent little planet that we have in the backdrop of the universe, of stars, and galaxies, galactic clusters, and recognizing how immense, how immense this universe is, and we're just a small part of it. And we have an important part to play in our civilization and in our future. Because either we're going to make it together, we're not going to make it all. "As heartwarming as Edgar's visit was to this community, I had to force myself to turn the page and approach my son Garrett and his girlfriend Esther with a different perspective, which would challenge and ridicule everything they were experiencing. I found and invited a person who had something to say and would do so in a public venue. He was no friend of when all the healed people of this town embraced as truth. He didn't care how many would be listening. >> Absolutely, the more the merrier. Welcome to all. >> We understand that you've created a website called citing Dr. Mercola's opinions about earthing and your own. >> Mostly correct, yes. That blog written by one of my blog authors, not by me. >> OK, and do you feel that earthing can be beneficial to healing and reducing inflammation? >> The short answer is no, I'm not aware of any reason why there might be anything beneficial connected with this. Basically, as far as I can tell you, what I know of earthing, is that it [INAUDIBLE] huge number of made-up, new-age claims. And I can't say I've heard anyone say they have a health benefit. [MUSIC PLAYING] >> I walked 30 feet today. >> What are the implications of all of this? Will it become an unstoppable force for the benefit of everyone? If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. So in the end, I remembered the others over this past 11 months that helped with this film and how they were affected. [MUSIC PLAYING] >> The earth knew what the patients needed. >> So y'all in town visiting? >> Yeah, we're here to shoot this movie and basically tell the world about the medicinal benefits, which are absolutely huge. [MUSIC PLAYING] >> As for me, I don't know what the future holds, but whatever happens, I'll certainly have memories. [MUSIC PLAYING] For each of us, eventually, whether we're ready or not, some day it will come to an end. There will be no more sunrises, no more minutes, hours, or days. All the things you collected, whether treasured or forgotten, will pass to someone else. Your wealth, fame, and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance. It won't matter whether you were beautiful or brilliant, rich or poor, famous or anonymous, or thought to be those things. What will matter is not only got, but what we gave, not what we bought, but what we built for those you loved. And if there is love, there is a reason to hope. I think now, I'm ready for winter.
