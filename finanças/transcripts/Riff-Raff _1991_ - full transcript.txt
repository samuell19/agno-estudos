You know what you’re doin’ here. You know which side you’re on, you’re down here. Down here. All that conduit and anything that wants fixin’, strip it. No, it’s all here. All this woodwork, I want all that preserved. Yeah? Yeah. So, what’s coverin' up? We have to do something there. Top floor liverpooled it. Well, just do what ... Just cover it all up. Board it. So the crux of it is, if you clock on late... You’ll clock off a bloody sight earlier, right. You got it? Thursday morning’s pay day. It’s also sackin’ day. Be warned. We hire these skips, not for you lot to lean on. They’ve gotta be filled. And while I’m on about it... I trust none of you lot are signin’ on as well. I didn’t think you could do that. You’d be surprised what some of you bastards get up to. I’ve had my eyes opened a few times, I’ll tell you that. What sort of things are you talkin’ about? Thievin’. Signin’ on under a false name. A casual approach to work. Laziness. And fuckin’ foul language. We’ll have no pissin’ in the corners. Not allowed. Frowned upon. Not very hygienic, is it? It’s bloody downright filthy. Can I ask you a question? Fire away. What’s your views on the ozone layer? I'll turn a blind eye to it, as long as it doesn’t interfere with the job. Nice one that. Anything else? Any chance of the sun? You have more chance of seein’ a one-legged cat... Fuckin’ bury a turd on a frozen pond. I've been told to report to Mr. Siddons about a job. Really? I thought you'd come to grant us three wishes. What's that? Here's my P-45. I don't... The foreman told me to give it to you. I don't want that. I don't want that at all.

About three and a half million. Do you know how many of them are building workers? 250,000. Yeah, but that includes the ones that wanna... Oh behave yourself, of course they wanna work. There's millions of acres of unused land. I'm not talkin' about green belt. For buildin' on. And the brickyards are stocked with gear. No one should be without a home in the 1990's. It's crazy man. Crazy. You've started him off again. Liverpool city council built 5,000 council houses when they were in power. The Labour council, right. What happens is, they got tea-bagged. The rest of the country, all the councils put together... He only wants a fuckin' squat! Built... The rest of the country... He only asked for a fuckin' squat! The rest of the country built this... Did you vote for what Margaret Thatcher did? I just ... I didn't vote for Margaret Thatcher. You, you... I never voted for Margaret Thatcher. It's you everybody for her. You voted for her. Margaret Thatcher got 41% of the vote. There was another 59% voted against her, son. He only wants a friggin' squat! I know he does. It's all right for you, mouthin' off all mighty. You've got a little house, haven't ya? But he only wants a fuckin' squat. Nothin' else. They what? They're coming for that Pascal's flat. Pascal's flat, yeah. It seems, isn't it? Put your leg up. What's that? Just put your fucking leg up. The first thing you have to do is get yourself a padlock for the door, just to make sure... Everything's secure in your garage in the morning. Excuse me, boys. Thank you. There's no flats in here for you. No, it's not like that. Can we get past please, son. Sorry? Can I get past? You can't... Can you get past? Yes please. Let's come on lad, I've got sons older than you. Move your leg, lad. Or I'll fuckin' break it. You just fuckin' bottle it! You can fuck off. No hassle off you. We'll give you none back.

Perfect. We use to own this bloody stuff, till she pinched it off us. We're only getting our own back. That little job's done then. Are we sitting comfortably? I hope my knockin' didn't disturb you, hasn't kept you awake. We just pulled the bleedin' awnings off the front there. There's nothing on "News at 10" about it. Oh well, they haven't switched that off. Yet. That's another thing we used to own until they robbed us. Can anyone explain to me... Why someone's gotta make a profit every time you boil a kettle. Or every time a kid has a drink of water. Or every time a pensioner has a warm by the gas fire. You know before, speculators used to make money out of land. And how's about it. You know now, they make it out of gas. What's that supposed to mean... Let me tell you. Every time you open your mouth it's like a bleedin' parliamentary debate the way you go on about it. Thank you for the compliment but you don't seem to take any notice of it, do you? We don't want to listen. I know but, you're missin' the point. There's people every day having the leccy (electricity) cut off. There's people every day gettin' their gas cut off. You go on and on all the time. Yes, and I will go on and on. I don't wanna listen to that. Oh listen to that, the long-con pro material. Well you keep goin' on about it. See ya, Stevie. You're long-con pro material.

I think some of you here should be very very proud of yourselves. For reducin' that little girl to tears. And I think you can go one step further. You can bury her dreams here. You can get this young girl to pack her bags. Cast her dream back to the beginning. But before you do that. I'm gonna ask that young lady to come back. Because I think she's great. I think she's got a lot of bottle. And I'm gonna ask her to sing again. Let's ask her back on the stage. Come on, for Christ's sake. It was like I could just feel the music comin' and it was all goin' round like this, and... I'm singin' and it was just comin' out. Yeah. And I was so ... Look, I brought my lucky egg.

Banty! Fuckin' clap! Louder! Banty! What the hell were you doin'? Those were important people! But they were ignoring you. Yes! They were important people. What the hell am I gonna say to my agent? She'd be better at sellin' newspapers than gettin' you work. Seriously, now what do you want... Oh shut up. If you don't take the respect... Oh just shut up! Would you shut up, you haven't a clue. They're all wankers in this business. They fuckin' don't give you respect. Oh my God... Could be... I'm so excited. Could be your big one. Yeah. Would you marry me? What? Will you marry me? Uh, I suppose so. You suppose so? I dunno. Maybe. You don't know, maybe? You're puttin' me on the line here. Well this isn't a joke. This is a limited offer. Next week when I'm famous you're going to have to shoot three people just to get to shake hands with me. Oh, is that right? Forget it. Ah, come on. It's nothin' personal. Nothin' personal? A turn down is as personal as you can get. Just forget it. Forget it! Forget it! I just said maybe. I didn't say no. Hey, Joe! Hmmm. What's Africa like? Huh? What's Africa like? Man, some places are just like this, you know, people live alright. Other places are not so good. Why do you ask? No, cause, seriously, cause, I'm thinkin' of goin'. You are going to Africa? Yeah! To do what? I dunno, it just really appeals to me. I just gotta go. You want to discover your roots. Yeah, well, among other things. It is not so simple a matter. What can you do? Are you an engineer? No, no. Are you an accountant? No, no. Do you have any skill? No. But I could learn. It's not so simple. He wants to go and discover his roots. Man, Africa is a good place to go. Of course it's a good place. Yeah, sure. If you like to party, if you... Love it. Love parties, love them. Man, I know you. You like to have a good time. This man has always got a smile on his face. He likes to have a good time. And why not? How is he going to eat? I went to one party for two weeks, man. Two weeks. Solid partying, man. He's, he's... I sleep for about three hours in between, you know? And you know, in the day? In the day, you go to the beach. Bar beach, man. It's what... Party, party, party. Beautiful beach, man, you know? It's as beautiful as... Africa is the best country in the world. What's he goin' to eat? I tell you man, the women. Oh, you, you, you... That's it. He could not handle the women anyway. I seen, I seen this man in action. I think he's okay. You could see him with Isabel, huh? He could handle her? What you lot on about? Hey, what you yappin' on about? We're talking about Africa, man, you know. He wants to go to Africa. Yeah, I wanna go. Africa? I thought you supported Millwall? I do. I want some of that and I want some of that. Well it would be a crappy hard day for starters, wouldn't it? It's not football, you know. I'm sorry, they're better over there, are they? Did you see Camer... Camerooooon. Camerooooon. Fuck it... Fuckin' hell, Kevin. You lookin' out there. What's happened now then? He almost fell off. Who nearly fell off? Kevin did. That scaffold is not safe. Come and have a look at it. What then? What do you mean there's a double missin'? It was only... He was leanin' on that. Leanin' on it? He ain't meant to be leanin' on it. Why's he leanin'? There's a holdup down below. What holdup? Hey, were you knocked off for the day now, then? We've only one then we've got no more left. Well get it movin' up here. Get him down and get him a cup of tea. Come on, he nearly died, you know. You and you, get a hat on. A man nearly died and... Get him down and get him a cup of tea. A hat is not going to save a man from dying, eh? They treat us all like blacks on this site, man. Hey man, you okay? You gettin' up? Susan! Hmm. You gettin' up? Come on then. Come on! Fuck's sake, Susan, you missed the guy yesterday, you're gonna miss him again today. That's no good. Just shut up, would ya. Oh God, shut up. Set the clock for ten minutes. You can'nae keep missin' appointments. He's gonna rub you out altogether. Unreliable, Susan. It's no good. You listenin'? Fuck it, movin' out. Fuck you! Don't you fuckin' do that to me! Come on, come on. You creep. Come on. You'll love me for it. Fuck. God, I hate you! I don't see what you fuckin' care about. You were meant to ring that guy for me last week and you didn't. Well I don't know Elton John, alright. Creep, you told me you did. Well, I said I knew a guy that roadied for him a few years ago, that's all. You can bloody try, you know. You could bloody ring him. You think I could. Well excuse me, I don't know if you remember a drunken roadie who worked for you a few years ago. But I'm his pal, and this is my bud. Now if you could possibly make a stab at makin' a friggin' a. Because that's how he fuckin' normally runs it. You creep. At least my dreams aren't wrapped up in boxer shorts. Well they were last night. Oh, you're disgusting. Everything you say has to come down to sex. Well I might fail, but at least... Fuck you! I try! Look, Susan, you're livin' in a fuckin' bubble. You gotta get something that makes it worthwhile! Well I suppose boxer shorts are worthwhile. And colored socks. Boxer shorts and colored socks. If you're gonna smash somebody's dreams, try and gettin' it fuckin' right, okay? I smash your dreams? You never encourage me in anything I do. Well that's rubbish. Every day I'm listenin' to you. I encourage you all the time, Susan. I'm fed up listenin' to you. All you do is talk about yourself. For fuck's sake. You ought to talk about something else for a change. The weather, football. Anything! Fuck you. I don't like football! Yeah, that's it. Every time we start to talk, every time. You just walk out. Well piss off. Bloke, piss off. I piss off every fuckin' morning at this time, it's not my choice. Fuck you. Don't you go. Don't you dare bloody go. Move. Fuck you, you... You fuckin' creep. Please don't go. Please don't. Please don't go. Oh! You seen the state of that? You don't bloody use that, do ya? Well I used to. Where are you supposed to go now? Jesus Christ. Shem, he still uses that bog, the soft git. No one ever ever uses that, do they Steve? Ah, not me. Somebody cut the hose under there yesterday, anyway. So where am I supposed to go for a crap? There must be somewhere so you don't shit yourself. Listen, laddie, you're bloody stupid. You know where to go? Up the fourth floor. Get on, onto the scaffold. And into the show flat. We're always bloody usin' it. Stupid. Friggin' stupid. Our company specializes in ah, converting these into modern homes. We're going to keep in as many of the original features as we can. I must tell you about the lighting. Another bathroom here, which I think you'll find very impressive. Who are you? Who are you? I'm... I'm checkin' the plumbing. Get out of there! Every... everything seems to be workin'. There you go. That's yours. Do you want a sarnie as well? No thanks, mate. I made them meself. What's wrong with 'em? I made 'em meself. God blimey, who's it scared you and give you a scrubbin' down? I've just had a terrible experience there, I tell you what, it was dreadful. I was in the show house having a bath. And three Arab birds come in. They were made up. Tried to chat me up. They said I was better lookin' than Yasser Arafat. Arafat. No, they like a bit of rough, don't they them Arab birds? Yeah, well, if they like a bit of rough, they'll love you. Those birds fancy you then, do they? No, well, they just don't see much of the old white sausage over there, do they? I thought they don't really see it much over here. What did they say? I'll put it behind me ear and smoke it later? You're just jealous. Listen, I must tell you a quick gag. Get on with it. A Scouse and his missus... On holiday in the casbah. And the old Arab's got a notice up on the store. Magic slippers for sale, ten pound a pair. Improve your sex life. So, the Scouse's wife says buy them, for a tenner. So he says, ah there, mate, give us a pair of them. You sure, you sure they'll improve me sex life? He said: Effendi, master of a thousand camels... Buy these slippers, you'll have no problem with the other gear. So he gets them. Puts them on, grabs the Arab, throws him over the counter. And he's givin' the Arab one. And he's shoutin': Effendi, effendi, you've got them on the wrong feet. Hey Joe, Joe. Joe. Give one of them sarnies Mo again. I heard you lot has to live in huts. Is that true? It can't be true, can it? What, in Beckenham? Listen... Shhh! The hut my father lives in has two floors and fitted carpets, please. And I study law if you don't mind. No, I wasn't bein' funny, I mean, I'm seriously thinkin' of goin' back. Tell me something interesting... I want to go to Africa, you know. He wants to go and live in Africa. You've never ever been! But neither have you. You haven't even been to Liverpool. I have. You go every bleedin' two weeks to sign on. West Africa. Piss off. You haven't, have you? Lagos, Luanda. Cabinda. Matadi. Kalabar. All over the world, lads. Merchant navy. You was never in the merch, was you laddie? Four years on the Mayflower. Talk further about some of them places, I mean, what's it like? Matadi's a paradise, my child. Beautiful. Matadi is a shithole. Shut up, you only know Nigeria, come on. Matadi is a shithole. Come on, come on. I know Matadi, man. Talkin' about shitholes, this is a bit of a shithole, isn't it? No, look at the state of it. There's no safety conditions. No safety precautions, no nothing. That's right. And we live in it, you know what I mean. We should stand up to those fellas in the office. And demand better bleedin' conditions. This is true. Well that's what the unions are for, aren't they? Well what are the unions for, laddie? If we would not have a union, we would not have nothing. Here, here. Well what have we got now? We still got bleedin' nothing. Come on, we have more than nothing. Let's, let's just be serious for a minute. If he fell off the scaffold tomorrow and lost an eye, he wouldn't get a balloon. If you fell and killed yourself, they wouldn't even pay for your body to be shipped back to Liverpool. At least if you're in the union, you get sickness pay, benefit pay. This is true. We need to stick together, otherwise we have no security. I agree with what you're sayin' and that, about the unions and all that... But you all boys have done what Tebbit said, didn't ya? I mean, you got on your bikes didn't ya? Of course we have, we've had to. He's from Glasgow. We're from Liverpool. He's from Bristol. These fellas are from all over the place. And we're chasin' the same few jobs. And while we're chasin' the same few jobs... They've got no problems, cause we're fightin' amongst ourselves, and we're leavin' them alone. What we should do, we should get U, UCATT down here. Which is the Union of Construction and Technical Trade... It's the buildin' site workers' union. We should get UCATT on the job, and get organized. And, and another thing is that there's not even any blinkin' safety equipment on the job. Half of them machines, the guards are missin' off them. And you know one of the lads had a bad turn there on the scaffolding, he could of broken his bloody back. Some of the kick boards are missin'. And the handrail was missin' on the top floor. I mean, they're hackin' off that concrete. There's bits flying everywhere. Someone's gonna lose an eye. And all we're asking for... Is plastic goggles, protection. That's all. A little bit of... It's all bein'... It's all bein' looked into, yet. I know, but every time you pick the Kango up you get a bloody electric shock. The wires are bad. It only wants a bit of adhesive tape round. If it pisses down, the whole bloody lot's gonna blow up, isn't it? You're all sorted out Thursday. You know if the factory inspector comes down he'll close the bloody site down. Don't worry, pet. Thursday it'll be sorted out. Alright? Yeah, well... What? I can'nae be fairer than that, man, can I? No, no. That's it. Thursday it'll be all sorted out, I promise ya. Thanks a lot. Cheers. Alright. Thanks for coming' in mate. Ta. Carry along. Larry Riley. What's the idea of the old black spot, kid? Well, exactly what it says. What's that? From today's date you are no longer employed by this company. Exactly what is written down there is exactly what it means. He let go? The big 'E'. Another one in Liverpool out of work won't make any difference. Mind your nose back there, can ye? Keep your place warm and those other too. You look after yourself, son. And you. You hang on to that, you wanna sodding wear it. You alright, Larry? Larry, you alright, mate? I'll be in touch, son, okay? Hey Larry! You sure you alright? Yeah. Hey, Larry, what happened, man? I've been hit in the bollocks, son. Why? Because I been old, and I been... Hey, mate! Is that you who keeps pissin' on the stairs? Well, we never had that trouble before and do you know what I mean... We're trying to keep this block clean. And it's right on your landing as well. Hey, when you movin' out? And the place is startin' to smell. Susan? Happy Birthday, Stevie. Jesus. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. What is it? Just never done that before. You sit. You gonna blow out the candles? Aye. Make a wish. Here, I got this for you. I made that for you. Here, I got this too... A present, then, eh? Yeah. Do you like them? Oh, what time is it? We do have word from my helpline. We've received an urgent message for Patrick Logan. Who used to live in Dewar Road, Drumchapel, Glasgow, and is now believed to be living in the London area. So if you're listening Patrick or anyone who knows him, Will you please contact your home, or call the Capital Gold helpline on 071-308-7575. That number again is 071-308-7575. It's... Hullo?

Stevie, couldn't you come back tomorrow on the train? Couldn't you come back tomorrow, Stevie? Couldn't you come back tomorrow? Stevie, please don't go. Please don't go. Please. God I love you. Please don't go. You know you really want to have a bit more faith in people sometimes. You want the ashes? We all might want them. Fi thought maybe you would want them. Maybe Robbie wants 'em. I don't think so. He'd probably fuckin' snort 'em. If you want them you need to buy a casket. You think? I don't know. It's the added expense. Cost you four quid for a plastic thing, you've got that for it and for the... Plastic? It's got plastic... urn for the ashes. No, I wouldn't have room on my bike for 'em, anyway. Oh not too bad. Me and Robbie here's off the methadone program, you know. Well that's good. And, we're goin' to the counselin', aye? Right. We're gettin' our act together. We're headin' out. Canada. Canada? Canada. Right. We're startin' alright for ourselves, aren't we? Yup. He can get a job there as a security guard. Really? You can in a month there, that's what I heard. That's right. And you get a... house with the job too. Right. Hey. House. With a garden. A garden and all? That's right, a garden. Can'nae beat that, can you? Very very peaceful here. In fact, it's one of my favorite spots. Is this alright? It's lovely, yes. Would you gather round, please? We're just going to scatter the ashes. Eh, do you not got a stone, something like that? No? No. We're to put her name in a book. So, if you gather round, I'll just scatter the ashes now. I think we'd rather do it ourselves, thanks. Well, if you like. But be careful, now. Do you want to do it? What is it? There's an offer wee buns. What do you do? Just push the lever gently and wave it around. Swing it a bit? Push the lever. She's... I can't, what, I can't...

There is everything to say. I'm a human being. I'm entitled to some respect. I own 50% of this relationship, remember. Jesus. You don't give a soddin' inch, do you? Okay, so what? I take some smack now and again. It's not the end of the bloody world. I know what I'm doing... You don't have a fuckin' clue what your doin'. You wander about the fuckin' day just lookin' like the party's goin' to start any minute. Don't you... Don't fuckin' tell me what you are. My brother-in-law used to counsel junkies. I helped him save this couple who were on a methadone program. They were tryin'. So we thought. And I'd go there and I'd sit on the couch. Sit among the towels that were soaked in blood. No veins left in their fuckin' arms. Blood was drippin' out of 'em. I seen it all before, they didn't need my help. But he begged me. You can't just turn your back, he said. So I helped them. Injected them through the soles of their feet. It's the only place left in their body they got a vein left. That's awful. Get the picture? It's a fuckin' nightmare. And it doesn't get any better. You're a junkie, tough. I am not, I am fuckin' not. You don't decide. You don't decide. You don't have that choice. You don't every stop being one. Ever! You don't know anything. You don't fucking know. It's only happened now because I happened to be gone somewhere. What happens when it all gets barmy? What happens when you get fed up? When you start sellin' the fuckin' furniture, anything you can get a fuckin' price for? Fuck you! You bastard. You don't know... Fuck. You don't know me. You don't fucking know me. Fuck you, I never hurt you. Never! I've only ever done some... anything to please you, for Christ's sake. Put a smile on your fucking face. You ought to have a little faith in people sometimes.
