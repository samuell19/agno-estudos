Just incredible! Outstanding paintings! Really.. very beautiful. No one can say that it's the first exhibition of the artist. Amazing! Lata had hidden this art of hers all these years. Yes. I must say. Lata and Abhijat have had a unique journey. This kind of journey in such a condition? How's it possible? Was Abhijat always like this? How was he by nature? He was a simple and ordinary man. Like one of us. Played and grew up in a small village. Like us who came to the city for education. He had many dreams for his future. One day he set out for the Mumbai for a job. Like the countless people dreaming about better future.. ..he also worked hard and finally found a job. After finding a job, he got married. Because he was married, he toiled day and night.. ..so as to fulfill his responsibilities towards his family. Just like us. But in this race of life, he had to stop one day. Listen to me. Abhijat is in pain. Please send an ambulance. It's an emergency. Madam, I told you. No ambulance is available right now. Please.. please try to understand. My husband is a CKD patient. Both his kidneys are damaged. He has been taking treatment.. ..in your hospital from past one year. He's unable to breathe. Madam, we're always in short of ambulances. We've only two ambulances. And both of them are out of the hospital. Any other option? - No chance. Hello. Hello. Hey.. Abhi. Abhi. Abhi. You.. have patience. Don't panic. I will get a taxi right away. Hold on, I'm coming. "No one could avoid it." "No one could understand." "This struggle of survival in life." "The path after the turn is always unpredictable." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Journey.." "This is the journey." Stop. Rickshaw. Rickshaw. Stop, please. Stop. Rickshaw, please stop. Drive fast, please. "Legs are tired and vision is faded. Even the hopes are given up." "Life has reached the stage of uncertainty." "Days of happiness are over." "No one knows what life has in store for us." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Journey.." "This is the journey." Sister. Blankets. "You always yearn for.." "..but you never get that love, affection and warmth in life." "You feel choking in such a situation." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Journey.." "This is the journey." Wow! What an actor! Such actors are born only once. Lata, check my sugar. Lata, yesterday your condition.. ..would be like that of Dilip Kumar from the movie 'Mashaal' (fire torch). Right? Hello. Stop the car. Someone, please stop the car. My husband's condition is critical. Someone please help me take him to the hospital. Is anyone here? Someone please help. My husband will die. Shut up, Abhi. Stop blabbering at this time of evening. Did I say anything wrong? Slowly.. It pained me. That's why I told you to learn driving. At this age? Sugar is normal. Did I say anything wrong? Should I learn driving at this age? Forget it. I still wonder how come you were in dire pain? Tell me one thing. Did you eat anything unusual.. ..in the party the day before yesterday? I asked you something, Abhi. No.. I didn't eat anything. Just one peg. Did you take liquor? Doctor has restricted you to drink.. ..only 750 ml water per day. Yet you drank liquor? 'Who says that I drink liquor to overcome pain?' 'I drink only to overcome sorrows.' Shut up, Abhi. Please stop overacting. Extend your hand. - Overacting?! Was this overacting? - Yes. Do you think my acting is overacting? - Yes. Yes, you will say that. Because I haven't got any chance yet. Let me get a chance. Then I will prove my talent.. to the world and you. What Abhijat is! Let that time come. Will see. Hello. Mom. Dilip here. Dilip. - Hey.. How are you? - I'm good. How are you? - I'm good. Mom, how's dad? Dad? I didn't want you to panic that's why I didn't tell you. Yesterday he was in severe pain. Why? It was obvious. Day before yesterday in Deshmukh's party.. I was just joking. Joking. - I swear. I mean it. Yes, you talk to your dad. Hear him now. Take this. Now, start overacting. - Hey.. what's this? Yes, tell me, Dilip. How are you? I am fine, dad. Thank you. How are you? I am fine. But this chemical imbalance in the body doesn't end. In previous test, it showed potassium deficiency.. ..and sodium in high range. This time, potassium increased.. ..and sodium has reduced.. Because of this urea is constantly rising. Which in turn leads to increase in creatinine. I tell you, hemoglobin is always ditching me. Do one thing. I will mail you my reports. Consult your Dr. Nickson and ask him the reason. Dad, Dr. Nickson is not ready to see your reports now. Why? He says that Indian doctor's line of treatment is correct. And for a dialysis patient, these changes.. ..in the body are like normal process. All the doctors are hand-in-gloves. Dad. Yes, listen. I've got details of a homeopathic doctor. If his medicine works, creatinine.. ..comes under control in just 2 months. Dad, several times I've told you. Not to take medicines from any other doctors like this. Why? This is the question of my life and death. You will know it once you reach my age. Dad, hold on. Please. Yes. I will show your reports to Dr.Nickson. But promise me you won't take.. ..any other medicine in the meanwhile. Is it okay? - Okay. Thank you, dad. Dad, give the phone to mom. Yes, hold on. Lata, Dilip wants to talk to you. I will talk to him later. She said she will speak to you later. Ok Dad, I will call you back. Bye. Hey, come here. Take this. What happened, Lata? Missing Dilip? Should we call him back home for a few days? No. Hello. What?! It seems their son didn't arrive. They said his flight is cancelled. These are just the excuses. Where there's will, there's a way. This man had a great personality. Moment he would step in the office.. ..staff would surround him. Today very few are seen here in his funeral. It all depends on your noble works in life. In constant struggle of settling down in life.. ..time slips from our hands like the sand. In its passion to shine bright in the sky.. ..the Sun never realize when it's time to set. like Pyarelal, I will also suddenly depart from this world. Abhi, what are you saying? Not more than 8 to 10 people will attend my funeral. Maybe Dilip will also not be able to arrive on time. I kept running for the day and night. All my life. Today when I look back, I realize. I haven't achieved anything in life. Neither for myself. Nor for my family. What you haven't achieved in life? This house, car. We've everything. We educated Dilip and sent him abroad. What did you bring along, when you came to this city? Dreams. I had come to this city with a dream. To be an actor. A dream to see myself on the theatre screen. A dream to create my unique identity. A dream to be noticed by the world. No.. I couldn't do that. I couldn't do anything. Today, I am Abhijat Inamdar. An ordinary man. An ordinary player in the game of this world. Common man. You had only two alternatives. Either family or dreams. You kept aside your dream of becoming an actor for your family. But yes. I was troubled because of it. Trouble? Yes, of course. Day and night I've to tolerate your overacting.. ..done in front of the TV and mirror. You've started jeering my acting once again. You're too much. What's the reading? 90 by 180. 90 by 180?! - Hmm.. How come? Ask the doctor. Apart from this, you must be ready with your.. ..questionaries for the doctor, right? Strange! If not doctor, who else will a patience ask questions? Abhi, calm down. - How can I? Did you hear her reply? Why should I keep quiet? You will always make me quiet. Okay, fine. Good morning sir. Abhi, wake up. Wake up. The doctor is here. Hello, doctor. Sir, his BP is 90 by 180. And his reports? Ma'am... Here they are. What had happened to Pyarelal? All of a sudden? Urea count had increased in his body. Farmers are troubled with the shortage of urea. And Pyarelal died because his urea count was high. Quite strange. It's better if you take care of your own health. If you wouldn't follow the regime properly.. ..weekly twice dialysis will have to increased to thrice. Or four times a week. Or else direct admission in ICU. Get few more tests done as I suggest. Okay, doctor. These doctors are quite strange. If patient gets better they take the credit. And if something goes wrong.. ..they blame the patient for not taking proper care. Then the test follows. They just want to loot people. And how do you control it? Today we will chat on this subject.. ..with world famous Ayurveda Acharya. Hello. Dad, Dilip here. Yes, tell me. How are you? Yeah, I am fine, dad. Thank you. What's going on? - Nothing. The same routine. Visit the hospital and get the tests done. I'm tired now. They take away our blood from the body and money from pocket. Now I understood why they always suggest tests? They must be getting a commission.. ..on every test. Dad, that's not the case, dad. Dad, medical science has advanced these days. And these tests help find out.. ..the exact condition of the patient. It's all nonsense. Dad, cool down. Do one thing. Send me your reports, I will show it to Dr. Nickson. Okay? Yes, and ask him how to reduce urea. And the.. creatinine. How to control creatinine? Once the creatinine is controlled.. - Dad. Don't think so much about your illness. Shall I suggest something? Dad, please shift your focus. Go to a hill station with mom for a few days. Watch a movie. Or a play. Oh. Dad. You need change. Okay? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. He's telling me to shift my focus. He will say anything. 'Gandharva Mahotsav'. Pandit Ramakant Joshi. He's the same guy. The Singer. "Who we are?" "What's our origin?" "What type of life-cycle is this?" "Who we are?" "What's our origin?" "What type of life-cycle is this?" "Who we are?" "What's our origin?" "On the unfamiliar path.." "..the passer-bys are always new." "Who we are?" "What's our origin?"

'..still I was completely lost in your classical song.' Yes, tell me. This energy.. And dedication. How do get this? Two important days in your life. The day you are born. And the day you find out why. I'm born for what? From past 6 generations.. ..we are passing this art to the coming generation. Since childhood, I knew that my life is made for this art. Once you realize your goal in life.. ..the passion to achieve your goal boosts you with this energy. Lata.. Lata.. What are you searching? Your medicines' box. I always keep it here. Abhi.. Abhi, have you seen it? Sit down. Are you okay? Lata. Ever since I've contracted this illness.. ..I'm making you do everything for me. I think at least I can take my medicines by myself on time That's great. I also had dreamt of creating my identity in the world of art. I wanted to do something recognizable. You have time. It's still not too late. Now, I can't do anything. Both my kidneys have failed. Twice a week I've to undergo dialysis. Still you will have to live. Now, do you wish to wait for your death.. ..or take new experiences in life until your death? You decide. Move, uncle. Move. Make way. Why are you taking such burden at this age? Wait. Wait.. Thanks, sir. You are pulling so much of weight at this age. I've to, sir. I've a son. He's always drunk and lost in his world. If I won't work, how will I feed my family? Aren't you troubled with this? Sir, When I feel more troubled, I visit the doctor. He talks about BP. But, sir. Only if I am relieved of my life's problems.. ..I'd think of treating BP. I'm uneducated, sir. But I know one thing. God has decided last date for everyone. When that last date approaches, you will die. We just have to take care of our karmas. Thanks. Shocking incidence happened in Chhapra, Bihar. A man of 38, carried his ..14 year old sick daughter and walked 27 kilometers.. ..to reach the hospital. His daughter died before he could reach the hospital. Let's know her father's feelings. I couldn't save my daughter. Poor's life is of no value in this country. The way she was suffering in my arms.. ..I will have to live with that regret all my life. Even after 70 years of freedom.. ..unavailability of basic facilities like ambulance.. ..is a shame on humanity. This father has said it right. People die their death. But it's not easy for their family members.. ..to forget them and move on in life. Okay, now go to sleep. Stop watching TV. It's 11 PM already 'This father has said it right.' 'People die their death.' 'But it's not easy for their family members..' '..to forget them and move on in life.' If my health deteriorates a little.. ..Lata gets panic and rushes everywhere. How will she bear the grief of my depart? And how will she remember me? Suffered of illness. An irritated man. Abhijat, who lived with a guilt.. ..that his dream remain unfulfilled. At this stage of life, what if I could have given her.. ..some good memories to cherish in future. What if I could restart life with her? What is the solution? What's remaining is special. And if we could do something special.. ..in this remaining life. Then not only the rest of the life.. ..but even our death could be a celebration. "Where there's will.." "..there's a way." "Where there's will.." "..there's a way." "Take control of your life.." "..and the sky will give you it's way." "Take control of your life.." "..and the sky will give you it's way." "Where there's will.." "..there's a way." Flatbread? Abhi! Huh?! "Overcome your fear and break all the bonds." "Win or lose, after all fighting matters." "He, whose goal is unique, is sure to win." "Take control of your life.." "..and the sky will give you it's way." "Take control of your life.." "..and the sky will give you it's way." Give it to me. Leave it. Leave it. - Give it to me. You will drop it. - I was calling you up. I was driving. How could I have answered your call? Wonder what's going on in your mind these days. You're never at home. And what's this? This.. this.. Actually, Lata. Except for the two days of my dialysis, I'm free otherwise. And the car that we have.. Car ambulance service? - Yes. There are many people who need ambulance. Like poor and senior citizens living alone in Mumbai. They need help. So? Lata. I was thinking of providing basic ambulance.. ..facilities in our car thus helping people in need. Are you mad? Do you even know what you're saying? And you decided all this without consulting me. I was going to tell you. - Abhi, is this your age? You can't handle all this. Yesterday, a man of my age was pulling.. ..heavily loaded cart to feed his family. Can't I drive a car? You're a kidney patient, Abhi. If you walk few steps, your sugar.. ..and BP goes up and down. After the dialysis you feel so exhausted.. ..that you never realize when you go to sleep. Listen to me, Lata. Wait a minute. I've always heard you in life. But I will not allow you to do anything like this. "Challenge your own life." "Come out of negativity and be insane." "Celebrate every single moment of your remaining days." "Take control of your life.." "..and the sky will give you its way." "Take control of your life.." "..and the sky will give you its way." "The sky will give you its way." "The sky will give you its way." Lata. What's this? Are you not ready yet? If you're capable to help others.. ..why do you need my company? Didn't aunt accompany you today? After marriage a girl gets.. ..shifts into her in-laws house. Then her focus changes from her own hobbies.. ..to her husband's likes and dislikes. Once these colours were my life. But I got settled in my married life.. ..and forget it completely. Abhi took his decision without consulting me. You must be feeling tired. - Yes. Relax for some time. And then go home. Okay? Thank you, madam. - Welcome. Yes, mom. I'm sure I've disturbed your sleep. No, I was working. It must be 2 AM over there. Yes, nearly. But tell me. Your dad is up to something now. Don't worry, mom. Little up and down of sodium and potassium.. ..in his next report will bring him back to his routine. Mom, there's a difference in saying something. And doing it practically. I can give you in writing. He can never do this because.. ..he is always feared of his own health. Don't worry. Dilip, your dad is coming. Tell him clearly that he need not do all this. Got it? Just a minute. Dilip wants to talk to you. Yes, tell me, Dilip. What's it? Nothing special, dad. Mom was saying that you.. You've thought of something really good, dad. But at this age.. Especially in such a situation. Dad, I hope you understand what I mean to say. You only said that I need a change. Shift the focus. Concentrate in something else. Yes, I understand, dad. But.. This is getting little daring and impractical.. ..especially at this age and in this health condition. Don't you think so? Dilip, ever since I became mature.. ..I could see only one race in life. Everybody was running.. ..to win the race. Without thinking about his goal. I was also a part of that race. When I thought over life practically.. ..weightage of all my desires and dreams became dull.. ..over the family, society, ego and financial resources. Today when I look back, I feel.. ..I haven't lived life actually. Maybe my approach in past was time's demand. But today.. Why should I live that life today? Now I wish to live a free-minded life. I want to enjoy my life. Dilip, I don't wish to live waiting for the death.. ..but the way I want.. ..I wish to live. By the way, Kevin. Meet my colleague. Dilip. Oh, Dilip. Hi Pleasure to meet you. My pleasure. - You know we've been working together.. Okay, very good. - ..for a long time. Good friends. Hey, Kevin. What do you do now? I am enjoying my life. I travel around. I go hiking with my dog. I camp in nature. Spend a little time teaching English at the library. Kevin, I am asking about your job.. ..your career. Oh that's my job. We used to work together in past. I worked in finance for ten years. And it's not at all okay. But as I went, I realized that it wasn't.. ..what I was doing with my life. And it just got more and more miserable. Until at the end.. ..there's a message I could hear in my head. Telling me. If you do this for another 30 years.. ..you will have wasted your life. I was so unhappy. I know I needed to stop doing that and quit. And find something else. But it is a.. years because of the fear of you know.. I was making good money at that time and.. ..the fear of losing the status of a good job.. ..and like anything. But as soon as I made the decision.. ..I realized that the fear disappeared and.. ..it was so clearly the right decision. I have been really happy.. The mistake Kevin was doing in his life. Life which dad is feeling guilty about. Am I doing the same mistake? Work, work and work. Even today, we, the India's world is.. Engineering, medical, commerce, that's it. Finding our own way. Trusting our own dreams. We could still not do that. These people trust their dreams. They never fear of chasing their dreams. But we, the Indians live only to work. Whereas these people work.. ..only to meet their needs of living. No, I don't say that. But you go there with what hopes? What do you get? Nothing much. I just sing for my pastime. Does this actually help passing your time? Hello. Hello, is this Mr. Abhijat? Yes, speaking. Who are you? Sir, this is Gulab. My father is seriously ill. Can you come with your ambulance? Yes. Sure. Wait a minute. Give me your address. 'Supan shrine'. Take right from there.. ..towards Subhash Nagar. Bhandup. - Okay. You can ask anyone once you reach nearby. Yes, sure. For the first time someone has called me for a help. Gulab Ingale. Subhash Nagar. Gulab Ingale. Yes, straight there. Gulab, is ambulance here? Yes, I am waiting. Stop shouting. Please check. Sir.. Quickly take them to the hospital. Abhijaat Sir.. Gulab? - Yes. Be careful. Please, sit. Let's go fast. Mom, how much money do you have? Only this much. Rs. 670. Dad, I will just come. Wait. I will just come. No bed is vacant. - Sir. Please, do something. No, not at all. - Please, check. How do I make arrangements? There's no empty bed. Come here. What happened? They told us to wait. - Why? They don't have any vacant bed. Patients are many. Sorry. - Sir, please do something. Don't get on my nerves. We don't have any vacant bed. Keep this. Let me see if you insist so much. - Wait a minute. Wait, I will just come. Just a minute. Just a minute. You said there's no vacant bed. On paying cash a bed can be arranged. Right? Accepting bribe? Do you know what will happen.. ..if I complaint your seniors? You will lose your job. Your family will die of hunger. Will you arrange a bed without bribe? Or want me to go to your seniors? No, right? Okay. Go.. go with him. He will arrange a bed for you. Go. Go. What did the doctor say? He's feeling better after an injection is given. But doctor told to keep him on a drip. When will you keep him on the drip? Dad said that after paying your charge if some money is left we will arrange the drip today. Or we will arrange it tomorrow or day after tomorrow. No. Don't worry about my charge. First arrange a drip for him. Thank you. Please, drive fast. - Drive fast. Fever. If you're so angry with me.. ..why were you tending me all night? You were suffering of high fever all night. I worked after many days. That's why I was tired. Your fever was 102 degree Fahrenheit. You were shivering of fever. This used to happen even when I was relaxing at home. Lata, If my condition gets critical and.. ..somebody comes to help in time, what will you say to him? That he did wrong. There are many of our age, living in the city. They are all alone. If we can help them. If we can be some help to them in their illness.. ..what is it called? A bad thing? Lata. Ever since I'm diagnosed with this illness.. ..I've been thinking. I've never troubled anyone in life.. ..then why God chose me for this illness? Later I realized I was foolish.. ..to live with an impression that I am immortal. It's then God chose me for this illness.. ..and it was His clear message. That body is a temporary home. This body.. You will have to leave this body. Understand why you're born in this world. And if possible, try to live your life that way. Every man born in this world has to die. But it's not that every man lives his life. I want to live before I die, Lata. Hello! Just a minute. Yes, tell me. Okay. Car, please. Please.. Stop. Please.. Stop. Abhi. - Abhi. - Yes. Freshen up. I will make tea for you. Okay, see you. Can't we appoint a driver? Helping people is an altogether different experience. I won't get that experience if I appoint a driver. One needs to experience it by himself. You just come with me once. Then I will do whatever you say. Oh my God! Don't get up. - Are you in pain? - Yes. My God! Isn't anyone at home? No, my husband has gone to work. Abhi.. Abhi, let's quickly take her to the hospital. - Yes. - Come on. Yes, relax. We are going to reach very soon. Take a deep breath. Abhi, drive slowly. Oh God! Hey.. My baby My baby. - Here.. - Yes. You brought her here, right? Yes. Hey, what are you doing, son? Get up. - You are like God to me. - Hey, no. Enough. Don't cry. See, you got a baby girl. What do you do? I'm into production of films. - Is that so? - Yes. Wow! That's great. Lata. What happened? I'm.. ..sorry, Abhi. - I am proud of you. - Hey.. Are you alright? - Isn't that good? Isn't it? - Yes. Isn't the joke really good? One more joke. After going through the medical reports.. ..doctor tells his patient. You might not be taking your medicines on time. Your sodium, creatinine and BP are shooting up. Patient said but doctor my BB is getting very low. Doctor asked, 'what's BB'? And patient said bank balance. Because he has to pay to the doctor and.. Yes. Sir, his sugar is normal. BP is 100/180. Reports? Sir, he didn't bring his reports today. Doctor. I will bring it next time. Actually, I forgot to collect it from the lab. These days you're becoming careless towards your health. Mind you. You're a CKD patient. CKD means, chronic kidney disease. If you continue to be careless, it will be.. ..costly to you. I expect my patient to be disciplined in his routine. Or else you can consult another doctor. Is that clear? Dad. Dilip here. Yes, tell me. Just called up, dad. Today I've planted a mango plant in the courtyard. Oh, that's cool. Even here, Americans usually do.. ..gardening in their backyard. But that's great. When you come back, you will see a garden over here. Really? By the way, how's the health? Whose? Dad. Of course yours. Okay, mine? It's good. Actually, doctor Nickson met me yesterday. He asked me that you're not sending him.. ..the medical reports these days. Tell him that Indian doctor's line of treatment is correct. And why do you always ask me about my health? Don't you have any other topic? Dilip, shift the focus. You need a change. That's great, dad. I appreciate it. Lata. - Come fast. - Coming. - We are getting late. - Yes. - Take this. - Yes. We've to collect the reports from the lab. Yes, let's go. Lata. You collect the reports. Meanwhile I will take the u-turn. - Okay. - To save our time. Okay. What happened? An accident. A car taking u-turn was hit by a tanker. The entire family is dead. Except a small girl who seems to be alive. Accident has taken place. Send an ambulance immediately. The girl is serious. Can't you understand? Her life is at risk. Send it quickly. Yes. Hello, sir. What's going on? That girl needs to be hospitalized. I know. I am waiting for the ambulance. Sudhakar. - Take him away. - Wait a minute. My car parked over there, is a car ambulance. What? - Sudhakar, take the girl out. - Yes, sir. - And take her in that car. - Yes. Quickly. Take her out. - Sudhakar, be careful. - Yes. Abhi. Abhi. Abhi. Abhi. Aunt. What's the matter? Let's see. Still critical. We will see. Excuse me. His reports. Why didn't you come yesterday? At least you should have informed us. - Sorry. - Madam. Doctor is here. Take this. Sir. Henceforth, will you decide when to undergo dialysis? What's this, Mr. Inamdar? What's going on with you? Doctor, reports. What do I do with the reports? He doesn't come for the dialysis on time. He doesn't bring reports. What do I do with these reports? If something goes wrong who will you blame? The doctor! - Are these his reports? - Yes, doctor. Your reports are encouraging, Mr. Inamdar. A small girl met with an accident.. ..and she lost lots of blood. You people can save her, right? What? Doctor, these days by his car, Abhijat is providing.. ..an ambulance service for the needy. I know.. ..what opinion people have about me.. ..and what they gossip on my back. They say the doctor is really good. But he's grumpy, angry and all that. In this dialysis ward, I've seen that some come here for two years.. ..some for four years, some for six and some for ten. I've been coming here from past 40 years. I could understand one thing.. ..patience can't easily get rid of this ailment. There's no freedom. 40 years passed. This ailment is defeating me. Still, I come again the next day.. ..just to fight with it. You... You just cannot win the battle unless you fight back. Damn it. You too are like that. Every time I used to come here, what you used to do? The same. You had questions, you had complaints. My BP has shot up, my sugar has gone up. This and that.. Today I got the patient I wanted. He's telling me. Doctor, don't worry. I am with you to fight back. I am proud of you. Keep it up. Okay, bye. Disha. Hey, Disha. Look who is here. She is not responding. Hello, doctor. Hello. He's Mr. Abhijat. Hello. Hello. I am her uncle. How's she now? She's in deep shock. She must express herself. Excuse me. Her dance teacher always says.. ..that she's very expressive. Entire day, she used to dance and act in front of the TV. She's very crazy for acting. Really? Really? Then Disha will have a good company with her grandpa. Right? Because I am also fond of acting. Okay, tell me. Which hero you like the most? Shreyas Talpade. Shreyas Talpade?! Hey, hold this. Hello. Hello.. hello, sir. Hello. Hello. How are you? I am good. - Shankar. - Yes, sir. I want to meet Shreyas at any cost. Sir.. I will try. Okay. Sir, Shreyas is shooting in the Filmcity. Stop. Stop, sir. Sir, who do you wish to see? I.. want to meet Mr. Shreyas. Has he called you? No, he hasn't but I want to say something to him. Sir, I can't let you go like this. Do you have any card? No. Sir, please park the car aside. Please. Over here. Yes, sir. I am opening the gate. Madam, do bring your card. Okay? Move.. move aside. Sound. Camera. Action. These workers have sweated.. ..for years to establish this factory. And you want to sell it.. ..because you're getting good price of this land? Great! This factory is just money making machine. But these workers have supported you for years. You didn't even think about them for even once? Cut it. Makeup artist. Go there quickly. Reach quickly. Hey, go there. - Yes. Bhushan. - Yes. Let's take one more. Okay. These workers have sweated.. ..for years to establish this factory. And you want to sell it.. ..because you're getting good price of this land? This factory is just money making machine. But these workers have supported you for years. You didn't even think about them for even once? Great, sir. Cut it. Superb! Wonderful, Shreyas. Bhushan, okay. I asked you. Okay, that's exactly what I said. Lets Shift. Chicken shop. Go there, to Bhusan. Bring it here. Sunil. Good shot. Will do. - Somebody should be there on the set. - Keep the heroine ready for the next scene. Just a minute. When will Shreyas sir's shooting start again? Shreyas sir? - Yes. His shooting is already over. There.. he is going. Sir.. sir.. Shreyas sir. Stop for a moment. - Wonder what's going on inside. - Yes. Long time passed. Hey, what happened? Nothing. Sir is talking about a girl who's hospitalized. Okay. That's why I request. If you meet Disha she will feel delighted. Who's she to you? I share a bond of humanity. Okay. I will be there tomorrow at 7 PM. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Should we call him up? His phone is switched off. What's this? He's still not here. These fans make them stars.. ..but they don't have time for their fans. They've no idea about the struggle.. ..one has to do to receive love from people. From past 40 years, I'm struggling to see myself.. ..on the screen. To receive appreciation from people. Just one chance. - God has given them a chance but.. - May I come in? I am very sorry. I'm.. quite late. After the shoot, I had to attend police function. - That's why.. - Never mind. So that is our little Disha. How are you, lovely lady? My God! Disha seems to be angry with me. No problem. I've an idea to appease her. Brother. There you go. Okay. Oh.. Is she so angry? So what do you want me to do to appease you? I see. Alright. Done. Anything for you, sweetheart. Okay? Mr. Abhijat. Actually, even your personality is nothing less than an actor. - What are you saying? - No, I seriously mean it. I used to act in plays in my college life. - Okay. - And people used to appreciate it too. My friends used to say that Abhi actually you should try acting in cinema. Okay. Yes, I had that personality also. Now.. That time I also dreamt of working in films. But now.. Mr. Abhijat. Yes. Will you act in films? Day after tomorrow at 4 PM. Mehboob studio. Let's go. Disha was so much in shock. She was crying until you returned after escorting Shreyas. Today it was her rebirth. It's my rebirth as well. Meaning? We've a double celebration today. First, Disha came out of shock. Second, Shreyas Talapde has offered me.. ..a work in cinema. Tomorrow I've to meet him at the studio. What? Shreyas said that you're actor personality. Will you work in the films? I was running day and night for myself. But nothing worked. Now that I'm doing something selflessly.. ..my dreams are coming true. That's strange. Bhushan, I was talking about him. - I see. - Mr. Abhijat. - Hello. - Hello. I genuinely feel that we must have a role for him in our film. - Sure.. we will.. - That's great. I am sure you've acted before. Yes. Not in films but I've acted in plays. Good. Romantic, serious, comedy. I've done diverse roles. I have never danced. But yes, I can move my hands and legs like Dharmendra. And about fighting.. Mr. Abhijat. Leave something for me. I'm the hero of the film. Sorry. You're right. Listen, day after tomorrow we will be shooting a scene. We'll give him a role in that. That's great. Superb. Day after tomorrow we are doing a scene.. ..with Shreyas. Shreyas has a rule. He's a gentleman. But he doesn't listen to anyone while at work. - Don't scare him. - No. He's right. You've a long career in acting. It's not easy to act in front of him. - Yes. - It's nothing like that. And after 40 years, I'll be working again. But, Mr. Shreyas, day after tomorrow.. ..Abhijat will be in front of you. - That's the spirit. - Great. I liked it. - Competition will be tough. - Yes. This is a universal studio. Come on, let's take a selfie. Say cheese. Yeah. Wow, Nilesh. What a place! Hello! Dad. Hey, guys, you carry on. I will join you. Okay. See you. Yeah, one sec, dad. Hello. Yeah, dad. What's it? Dilip. - I've got an offer to act in a film. - What? Yes Amazing. But how? I don't know. You can say it was a miracle. Oh dad! Congratulations! I am really happy for you, dad. Thank you. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Dad. Abhi. Hello. What?! Abhi! Abhi, you please go. Don't disappoint her please. I am here. Everything will be alright. You go. Hello, who's this? Madam, Abhi sir hasn't reached.. ..the shooting location yet. He's not even answering the call. Yes.. he has just left. He will be there very soon. Actually, Disha is once again admitted in the ICU. That's why he's late. We will do that later. Otherwise, the director will remove me from the film. Director. - Let me go through the scene. - Here it is. Yes, come in. This.. hey, Mr. Abhijat. Hello. - Hello. - Come in. Please, sit. All set? - Yes. - Ready? - Any changes in the scene? - No, it's final. You've a habit of changing it. Shall we rehearse, sir? What? - Rehearsal? - Yes, sure. Who? Disha.. Prasad. The name is Prasad. Sorry.. sorry.. Disha.. hey.. Oh.. Sorry. I can't do it. No, relax. Just relax. It's okay. It happens. It happens. I can't do it. I just can't.. Strange. Day before yesterday you promised me. That you will come prepared. Abhijat will be standing before you. I got a chance after 40 years. What about all that? Gave up? I was so happy that I am giving chance.. ..to a deserving candidate. They think acting is that easy. - Sorry. - You may go. Sorry. You.. Please call Sabby. Sir. Disha is once again admitted in ICU this morning. Maybe that's why.. Mr. Abhijat. Mr. Abhijat. I am.. I'm really very sorry.. ..to be rude with you. Actually, we've a rule in the industry. No matter what.. ..but the show must go on. Life is in God's control. But if you act in the film today.. ..you will definitely make Disha happy. Read this note. Let's rehearse. Come. Action. Hey.. Many days passed but Prasad hasn't sent any letter. Yes. Actually, he's posted in Kargil these days. Maybe that's why it is taking long for the letters. Maybe it's taking long. Why? Last time he was posted in Ladakh. That time we received letters regularly. I'm worried. - Yes. Uncle. Someone is here to see you. May I send him? Who's it? Who are you? Are you Prasad? Who are you? I am Samar Singh. Prasad's friend. What's the matter? Prasad and I were posted at the border in Maratha Battalion. This is his letter for you. What's written in it? Please read. Uncle. While fighting with the enemies on border.. ..Prasad sacrificed his life. What? His dead body? Sorry, uncle. His body isn't recovered. Uncle. - I'm okay. - Hey. What are you both talking about? He's our Prasad's friend. He's also in Kargil with Prasad. Am I right? He said that Prasad is fine there. Didn't I tell you that he may have been.. ..unable to send letter. He said he won't be able to send letters for few more years. And he won't be able to call up as well. Because.. ..he.. ..has been posted up now. Good you came. I was getting negative thoughts. Wait. I will bring some sugar. - Yes. Let me sweeten your mouth. Yes, please bring sugar. Sweeten your mouth. - Uncle. Uncle. Aunt.. Don't tell her. If she will come to know she will not survive. It's a mother's heart. I don't want to lose her. I don't want to lose her now. I don't want to lose her now. Wow! Wow! I really enjoyed the film. Especially the direction is too good. Mr. Bhushan, fantastic cinema. - Thank you. That old man has done the emotional scene so well. Hats off to that guy. - Thank you. Fantastic. Congratulations! Mr. Abhijat. - Yes. Please, come. I see. Mr. Abhijat. Hello. - Hello. His performance was so catching. Give him a bigger role in your next film. You snatched away my words. I am doing one more film.. ..on son and a father. Will you take up father's role? Wow, Mr. Abhijat. The function was so grand. I felt so good to see you appreciated. I was so happy. Abhi. Are you losing breath? Are you not feeling well? Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car. Wait a minute. Stop. Stop. Stop. Hey. Stop. Please. Stop. Stop.. stop, please. Please, stop.. Abhi. How are you feeling now? I'm good. He's feeling better now. Thanks. Uncle. Are you okay? Yes, feeling better. Sorry, you're troubled because of us. Not at all. After watching the film I was on my way home. No one was ready to stop the car. Had you not come on time.. Few days ago, an incident had happened in my life. If it had not happened.. ..maybe I too wouldn't have stopped the car. In was in last month.. One of my friend's father was alone at home. Suddenly he was feeling uneasy. I think it was heart attack or something like that. Oh. I tell you.. he was of uncle's age. He's also a patient yet he runs an ambulance service. He reached home on just one phone call. He took uncle to the hospital and waited there.. ..until my friend reached there. Actually, he inspired me to do this. The ambulance man. My hero. How are you, The Ambulance man? Think again, Abhi. You've dreamt about it from so many years. Will you leave it like this? Hello. Hello. Hello, Mr. Abhijat. Tell me. Well, I wanted to talk to you. If you've time. Otherwise, some other time. No, please tell me. Wait a minute. Yes, tell me now. I am sorry but I can't take the role you've offered me. Why? There are many fantastic artists in the industry.. ..for a father's role in a film. But I feel.. ..I should play a father's role for people like Shankar and Disha. Because, they will be in need of this father anytime. I hope you understand. You've become a real life hero, Mr. Abhijat. I am proud of you. Thank you. Hey.. look at this. Article published on you in the newspaper. I am going to invite a young man to guide us here. Age.. only 67. With a huge round of applause.. ..let's welcome the ambulance man.. ..Abhijat Inamdar. Life.. ..is a journey. And it's compulsory to keep walking in this journey. If you enjoy this journey in your retired age.. ..it'd be much enjoyable than that of your early life's journey. This isn't the retirement age. This is the new 40 plus age. Of this modern time. Ambulance man. Please give a big round of applause for.. ..ONN international's Man of the year award.. ..Mr. Abhijat Inamdar. Dilip, you look very happy. Hey, man. My dad got award as the ambulance man today. Congratulations. - Thank you. Excuse me, gentlemen. Hey, Ryan. Ryan. Nilesh. Why did he leave like this? It's the same old American issues. In his childhood, his father left him and his mother alone. Now, it's found out that he is remarried. Maybe he got emotional listening to you praising your dad. It's very common here. Talking with him on phone. Asking about his health. Taking his reports to the doctors. Sending money to him. Does my dad deserve only this much? Lata. You make the best onion fritters in the world. Will you take some tea? Yes, sure. But hold on. I will make tea today. What? Do you think I can't make tea? Lata. Oh my God! Vidya! What a pleasant surprise! I know. I'm so happy. So am I. - But you forgot me. How can I forget you? Oh my God! Vidya, I'm seeing you after so many years. I tried my best to get in touch with you. After marriage, Samar got a job in USA. I see. - So we shifted there. This year we decided to enjoy vacation in India. And one more coincidence happened. With Abhijat, I saw your photo in the newspaper. I missed you so much. Shall I say something? You're still the same. Don't lie. - I mean it. Both of you please chitchat. I will make tea for all. Why will you? What do you mean? Should I not impress you? That I take such good care of your friend. Actually, before you arrived, it was decided between us. That I will make tea today. Please, continue. Do you remember we used to go out so much. We had such fun. - How can I forget? Lata loved going out. She's a true nature lover. Am I right? Tell me, Lata. I'm sure you've been on tour to the entire India. Leave it. Tell me which places you have been till now? Just last year we had been on the world tour. I've clearly told him. That you can do anything you want throughout the year. But 20 days of the year will be mine. And you'll have to take me to a new destination every year. If you wouldn't do that, I will divorce you. Correct, Samar? - Yes. Lata. Do you remember one more girl was with us? What's her name? Neelam. Do you know her whereabouts these days? What's she doing? I'm sure you've been on tour to the entire India. The journey of life is like climbing a mountain.(Tightrope Walking) You've to balance yourself every moment. In the early days of my life I was engrossed in my work. Now, being an ambulance man.. ..to make my last journey a memorable one.. ..I'm compelling people to forget their own hobbies. In this journey of life.. ..Lata had always supported me in every step of my life.. She helped me balance myself on the curvy path. But I never cared to know about her likes and dislikes. So, how are you, ambulance man? Are you here? - How are you feeling now? Great. Where's Lata? She has gone to bring the medicines. - Okay. Doctor. I've something to talk to you. Tell me. I've decided to go out for a few days. On a hill station, to Manali. Have you lost it? - Why? Your creatinine is rising. You feel more tired now. Doctor shouldn't form any emotional bond with his patient. Isn't this taught to you? So.. Everything seems to be normal with dialysis patient. Creatinine will do its job. We should do ours. Remember one thing. This 14th February is our marriage anniversary. Really? - Yes. Congratulations. - Thank you. And I've decided to take Lata on a trip to Manali. You also join us. Take your wife along. We will enjoy. You all can enjoy. My benefit is that I will get a doctor ready at my service. Thank you. But some other time. Some other time! Will that time ever come again? It will.. "Seasons change as per our desires." "It's like the untimely arrival of spring." "After every turn, disappears.." "..this curvy path." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "On these turns, the sweet memories of life became fresh." "With a sweet companionship, life becomes scented." "Happiness unfolds." "..holding each other's hand. "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Fresh tunes synch in melody." "To fill the life with beautiful colours." "The journey becomes comfortable.." "..holding each other's hand." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Journey.." "This is the journey." Although I refused you brought me here. But I didn't even realize how these two days passed. Even this journey is important in life for a couple. Lately I realized this. I am sorry, Lata. Sorry. What's this? Taking out on vacations isn't a certificate for proving your love. I've experienced your love for me.. ..in every moment you cared for me. With a companion like you.. ..this life's journey was so comfortable. I feel time should halt here. Abhi, we will reach Mumbai tomorrow in the afternoon. So I've taken the dialysis appointment in the evening. Lata. Frankly speaking.. Now, I don't even feel like taking the dialysis. Good evening, ma'am. All preparations have been made. We are just waiting for you. Okay. - Thank you, ma'am. Few years back, Abhijat had lost all the hopes of living. Today I see him enjoying every moment of his life. And I feel so happy. You also arranged a surprise party? Not at all. What are you saying? This is your doing. Why do you need to do this? Hey.. seriously. I didn't arrange this. What do you mean? Dilip! Mom! Dad! - Hey.. How come you're here? Dad. Doctor Nene called me up a couple of days ago. He told me that you both are planning a celebration here. So I joined you. Travelling 30 to 35 hours? For us? Why? Don't you trust me? Not more than 8 to 10 people will attend my funeral. Maybe even Dilip will not reach on time. No, it's not that. It's not about the trust but.. Happy marriage anniversary! Happy marriage anniversary! Yeah.. Hey, thank you. Thank you very much. You've made such good arrangements. But why did you take pain to arrange all this? Pain? Both of you have taken pain all your life for me, father. Father?! Yes. Father. Because I've understood the difference between.. ..the words 'father' and 'dad'. It's my parents’ marriage anniversary today. But I am going to talk about my father only. 'Even the Almighty of the three world.' 'Is like a beggar without a mother.' This is my respect for my mother. Mother and son share a very close bond. She's a mother. A friend. He can share anything with his mother. He can even express anger on her at times. But father.. ..even after doing everything he is always standing far away. Why? Because ever since our childhood we've heard.. Do your studies otherwise father will hit you. Don't watch TV, father will scold on you. Slowly, distance between father and son keeps increasing. It's not that his father doesn't caress him. But only when the son is sleeping.. ..the tired father comes home late in the night.. ..slowly caresses his son and kisses him. But the sleeping son is unable to see his father's love. Time flies. And the son realizes that there are some problems in his house. But his father's courage is bigger than those problems. To meet family's needs, and to fulfill his son's dreams.. ..the father keeps crushing his own dreams and desires.. ..without letting others realize it. Time flies again. Now the son has become young and father has aged. Now the father feels like sitting with his son.. ..talk with him and play with him. When he looks at his son with some hopes.. ..is ready to take his own flight to achieve his dreams. Once again without letting anyone know.. ..the father sends his son to his dream world. In this race of life, at some point of time.. ..on the path of achieving dreams.. ..every son starts to understands his father. Even today.. ..a father finds his happiness.. ..in his son's happiness and success. Even in his illness, he'd protect his family. And the son always feels like telling this to his father. 'Father, you did a lot for us.' But... sometimes.. out of fear ..and sometimes out of respect.. ..he doesn't say anything to his father. But I want to say it today. I want to tell you, father. You've carried me on your shoulder when I was a child. Today I want to put my hand on your shoulder and say. Like we freely talk with our friends. I want to talk to you like that, father. I got a father like you. I'm so lucky. Dilip. Every father is always eager to hear these words from his son. But this isn't the day to cry. It's the celebration time. Let's Celebrate. 'What's remaining is special.' 'And if we could do something special..' '..in this remaining life.' 'Then not only the rest of the life..' '..but even our death could be a celebration. ' Abhi, are you alright? - Yes. So come. Dilip is calling you. Why are you standing here? Watching the journey. What if I had found this way of living life earlier? But I am satisfied today. I'm happy. Satisfied. Father. Mother. Lata. How did you like my performance.. ..in the role of Abhijat on this stage of life? Top. Over actor. How much will you overact? Let's go. - Father. Dilip is calling you. He's so happy. Mother, come. Come on. Hey.. Why did you sit down? Get up. Abhi! Why do you overact? Abhi. Get up. Abhi.. hey. What are you doing, Abhi? Get up. Abhi?! What.. How many steps join you in your last journey? How many eyes shed tears for you? That's important. Because you're empty handed in this journey. "No one could avoid it." "No one could understand." "This struggle of survival in life." "The path after the turn is always unpredictable." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Legs are tired and vision is faded. Even the hopes are given up." "Life has reached the stage of uncertainty." "Days of happiness are over." "No one knows what life has in store for us." "Journey.." "This is the journey." "Journey.." "This is the journey."
