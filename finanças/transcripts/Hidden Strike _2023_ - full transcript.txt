[gentle logo music] [upbeat piano music] [dramatic music] [nickering] [neighing] [dramatic orchestral music] [tense score] [dramatic drum hit] [Arabic-inspired score] [tense dramatic score] [news reporter] After surviving relentless attacks from mercenary forces in the escalating oil wars, sources tell us that pleas have finally been answered for the besieged employees of Yutime Chinese oil refinery in the Middle East. Professor Cheng, Yutime's Director of Operations, tells us that a private security team from China has volunteered to carry out the high-risk mission of extracting her trapped oil workers, who are facing certain death, and escorting them to the safety of the Green Zone. [helicopter blades thumping] [sighs] Commander Luo, we're approaching the LZ. Copy, Captain. [tense score continues] [automatic rifle clicks] - [Cheng in Chinese] Dragon Luo. - [Luo in Chinese] Yes. [in Chinese] Professor Cheng, head of Yutime Oil. [in Chinese] Hello, professor. [in Chinese] Thank you for coming to rescue us. [in Chinese] Can you bring me up to speed? - [in Chinese] Of course, follow me. - [in Chinese] HaiMing, unload. You two, follow me. Hurry up. [in Chinese] Yes, sir. [Cheng in Chinese] We are only safe inside the refinery. [Luo in Chinese] Don't worry, we're here to escort you out. Our planes are waiting for you in the Green Zone. Do you know who the rebels are? [Cheng in Chinese] I don't know. They want us to give up the refinery. We've been surrounded for two weeks. They launch an attack every couple of days. We've increased our security but if they launch another attack like yesterday, we won't make it. We must evacuate immediately. [in Chinese] How many are we evacuating? [in Chinese] Four hundred and ninety eight including the children. [Luo in Chinese] There's a lot of things to do before we go. We plan to leave at dawn. Gets it all and is happy with it. Looks happy, looks concerned. He's concerned now. It's in the sand. [boy in Arabic] I made it. How's it going, Chris? You're late, Henry. Jesus, Chris. Here's your money, as promised. We go in and out. Nobody hurt. You're gonna count it? Hell yeah, I'm gonna count it. Listen, you're family but you're a thief. Ah. Bald Eagle over there, he doesn't care if I count it. Bit of a misread on me, I think he does care if I count it. Or-or was it the nickname? You guys do nicknames? You guys don't do nicknames. Are you kidding me? Nicknames are like the heart of team camaraderie. Huh, you guys are in luck, nicknames are like my superpower. I've been giving 'em out since peewee football. Yeah, bro, these guys are a little bit on edge. I'm gonna take the edge off. Okay, [clears throat] Bald Eagle, like the one from the Muppets. Toothpick. There's a double meaning. You'll figure it out. Uh, Tomb Raider, because I just... I just feel like you'll haunt me long after I'm dead. [tense score] [sighs] Uh... Full disclosure, there's a lot going on here, uh... I'm drawn to "Graffiti" 'cause it looks like some teenagers vandalized your face. That's not it. It's just a start for me, but I got you. Bro, can you be serious for one second? Have you given any more thought to my plan? Like, one more mission, five times the money? Can't do it. I've already done way too much. You're telling me this place couldn't use more money to fix things up? Don't start. Yeah, well, it's a big job. - No. - Moving target. No. And it's for Unicorp, bro. Not interested. You remember that rebel attack on Area Seven, don't you? When five of our guys got popped. This is the son of a bitch who armed them. And right now a team of mercenaries is escorting this dirtbag back to China. You wanna take on the Chinese? No, no, no. It's not the Chinese. It's an international criminal, all right? She's being extracted on the Highway of Death back to the Green Zone. [boy in Arabic] Big Dog, come on. Stay there, I'll pick you up. Highway of Death? The most dangerous road in the country. You know that. You're an idiot for even thinking about it. Yeah, Dad would've done it, though. [Chris sighs] [tense score] That was low. Even for you. [truck engine starts] [boy yells excitedly in Arabic] Keep your eye on the ball, okay? Almost, almost. Now let's let it rip. Hit the mitt. Whoa. - Fantastic. - [car horn honking] You got it, Funhouse, come on. Hey, Soraya. Hello, Owen. You look beautiful today. What? No! I hope you don't mind me saying, but that, um, abaya, it really makes your, your skin glow. Owen, stop. Always working. No harder than you, my friend. [briefcase clatters] So what about the pipe? It's bone dry. And you're wasting your time. Pump's rusted. Pipe's disconnected. - [grunts] - [valve squeaks] [goat bleating] [sighs] Damn, I hate this company. Well, I hate we don't have water. Yeah. I mean, I have a little. I got buckets and charcoal, so we bring a little at a time, but it's not enough. I mean, they built that dam. - They cut this place off. - [Owen sighs] If you want, I can go talk to Unicorp headquarters but you know how that goes. You want us to bribe 'em for water? There's only one thing more expensive than oil. Water. The more desperate, the more expensive. How much? [Owen sighs] Probably a 100 grand. [tender score] I'm sorry, I'm doing all I can. It's just that it... I'll get a crew together if you guys can get the money. Okay. Do what you can. This place is gonna die without water, man. [ominous score] [in Chinese] The weather conditions are clear. [in Chinese] Let them know we'll arrive at the Green Zone in two groups. One at nine a.m., the second at four p.m. [in Chinese] Got it. English, please. What about air recon? Your primary and secondary routes to the Green Zone are hostile. [Pilot] Sir, all the other options are rebel controlled. [comm clicks off] Then we're still taking the Highway of Death. It's the fastest way from here to the Green Zone. Nonstop, eight hours. [dramatic score] [tender score] Chris, where are we going to get the $100,000? [sighs] - [crickets chirping] - [dog barking in distance] I'll think of something. Okay. [receding footsteps] [object clatters to table] [dramatic score] Sector four, ready. Sector three, ready. [beeping] Sector two, ready. Sector one, ready. [in Chinese] We are shutting down. [in Chinese] Got it. [in Chinese] Professor, we need the dongle. [whirring] [slow rhythmic beeping] [two quick beeps] [machinery whirring down] [in Chinese] You feeling better? [in Chinese] Not really. [metal ratcheting] [prolonged beep] [in Chinese] System off. [in Chinese] Mei, hold my bag for me. -[in Chinese] Okay. [in Chinese] Be careful. [in Chinese] Professor, we must go right away. [Cheng in Chinese] Get ready, everyone, we're going! [nervous chatter] [dramatic score] - [in Chinese] Do a head count. - [in Chinese] Yes, sir. Come on. [children chattering] Follow me. Come on, come on. [in Chinese] Professor, there's still another seat on bus eight. You can go with your assistant. [in Chinese] Excellent. Let's go. [in Chinese] But you are on bus one. [soldier shouting] [in Chinese] Okay. I'll see you in the Green Zone. [in Chinese] Please be careful. [cap clicking off spray paint can] [hissing] [in Chinese] Dr. Mei. I saved a seat for you. Shadow Squad. Let's go! [in Chinese] Yes, sir. [in Chinese] Move out. You hold tight. [pilot] Okay, let's go. [helicopter blades thumping] [engines whining] Commander Luo, the helicopters are pushing ahead to the Green Zone. You're on your own now. [beep] Radio check one. Two check. Three check. Four check. Five check. Six check. Seven check. Eight check. Nine check. Ten check. Eleven check. [click] [metal creaks, clangs] [diary hits seat] [gasps] [in Chinese] You can't stand the whole way. Road's bumpy, it's dangerous. [in Chinese] I'm fine. [in Chinese] More stubborn than your mom. [in Chinese] So you still remember her? [engine slows] [air brakes hiss] [ominous score] The Highway of Death. It looks so tragic. [in Chinese] A lot of people died here during the war. It's still dangerous here. Don't worry, we'll be okay. Watch the sides. Prepare yourselves. Please sit down. Hm? [Mei scoffs] Seatbelt please. [air brakes hiss] [gear selector ratchets] [engine revving] [gear selector ratchets] [exciting score] [in Chinese] There's a minefield ahead. [in Arabic] I can see them coming! [in Chinese] I know. Don't worry. Stay in formation. Be careful. [in Chinese] What are you doing? [in Chinese] There's no mines there. [condor screeches] [tires squealing] [explosion] [excited chatter] [dramatic score] [excited chatter] You see? It's all a trap. They want to lure you in somewhere you think is safe and take your life. Mei, I'm here to protect you. [in Chinese] You are here to be a hero not for me, but for them. [in Chinese] Your name was on the evacuation list. [unbuckles seatbelt] [in Chinese] So, you brought your team all the way here to save me just for my forgiveness? It's not gonna happen. You broke my mom's heart. And mine as well. I'll never forgive you. [in Chinese] It was your mom who took you away from me. [in Chinese] That's just because you never cared about us. My mom was lying there in the hospital, she couldn't get out of bed but you never bothered to visit her, not even once. How could you be so cruel? [in Chinese] I was on a top secret mission. Our country needed me. [in Chinese] Our country needed you? Right. What about me? I was so little. Mom was in the hospital, she needed you more. But what have you done for us? As an engineer here, I'm grateful for you. But as your daughter, there's nothing left to say. [in Chinese] Dragon, on your one o'clock. [dramatic score continues] [in Chinese] Attention, everybody. There's a sandstorm up ahead. QiXing, didn't you say the weather was clear? [in Chinese] I've been keeping an eye on the data. It shows the chance of a sandstorm here is zero. [Luo in Chinese] If we don't keep going, we'll miss our window. Jing and Yan, close the hatches. We need to get through as fast as possible. [dramatic score continues] [soft boom] This sandstorm is very unusual. [ominous score] HaiMing. HaiMing? HaiMing, do you copy? [in Chinese] I don't copy either. [in Chinese] ShenWei? Yan? Strange, there is no signal. [in Chinese] Hey, is that... [Luo in Chinese] What? [in Chinese] Huh? Nothing. I thought I saw something. [engines revving loudly] [Chris] Should be close to the target. Tell me what you see. [Henry] There it is. Our objective plus four of her core crew. [Chris] Toothpick, Tomb Raider, we're on the X. Scribblehead, extract and drop. Let's go. [loud engines] My name is Knox. [engine revving] [clicking] [in Chinese] How is it causing so much interference? [engine revving] [frightened exclamations] [engine accelerating] Get back on the main road. [Chris] You having fun yet? Just keep your head on a swivel. [compressed air releasing suddenly] [tires squealing] [rapid beeping] [driver exclaims] [boom] [screams and cries] [grunt] [dramatic score] [boom] [Henry] Everybody down! Nobody move! On the ground! You, got a hearing problem? [grunt] On the floor, don't move! On the ground! [Chris] All clear. Lane secure. Down, down, get down. You, wanna die? On the floor! Don't move. [gunshots] [passengers screaming] [gunshots] [grunts, groans] [knife singing] [thud, grunt] [tinkling] [grunt] [bus engine revving] [excited chatter] [grunt] [thud] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [in Chinese] Where are they going? [digital clicks, interference] [in Chinese] Strange... [nervous chatter] ShenWei? Yan, HaiMing? Does anyone copy? [air brakes hiss] [dramatic score] Gather round! [in Chinese] Hurry up! [in Chinese] Why isn't anyone answering? [in Chinese] Our comms went completely down just now. [in Chinese] What about you guys? [in Chinese] There's nothing. No signal. [in Chinese] Are all the buses here? [in Chinese] I saw bus eight leave the convoy. [in Chinese] Where did it go? [in Chinese] East. - [in Chinese] Where is Yan? - [in Chinese] Bus 11 is gone too. [in Chinese] What's wrong with you? You lost two entire buses in a sandstorm. [in Chinese] That storm is not natural. [score swells, fades out] [in Chinese] Hurry up, hurry up, go! Go. Go. Hey, these the guys that armed Area Seven? - Yeah, why? - These guys? [Henry scoffs quietly] What's a criminal supposed to look like, bro, huh? You remember Typhoid Mary? She killed like a 100 people. Yeah, she was just a cook. [beeping] [in Chinese] We got it! [in Chinese] Dragon! Captain Azir, we lost two buses. We need both helicopters here. Copy, Commander. We are circling back. Okay. - [in Chinese] Take the second helicopter. - [in Chinese] Okay. - [in Chinese] Follow me. - [in Chinese] Where? [in Chinese] You're familiar with this desert. Isn't this part of your job? [in Chinese] Yeah, I have surveyed this area with Professor Cheng before. Why? [in Chinese] I need your help finding the missing buses. [in Chinese] I... [dramatic score] [in Chinese] Don't worry, I will protect you. [helicopter blades whirring] [dramatic score continues] It's breaking up. This doesn't happen in the canyons. Look! [wind blowing] [in Chinese] ShenWei, the sandstorm was man-made. They used jet engines to push the sand. [in Chinese] Copy. Azir, head north. [exciting score] [in Chinese] Dragon, Dragon! Dragon! Can you hear me? We were ambushed by mercenaries. [in Chinese] Who were they? [in Chinese] Americans. They were very fast. Very organized. [in Chinese] You stand down. Connect with HaiMing. [in Chinese] Copy. [in Chinese] HaiMing, can you get a GPS position on bus eight? [in Chinese] GPS can't locate it. [in Chinese] ShenWei, scan a 10-mile radius for any fast-moving vehicles. Report if you find anything. [in Chinese] Copy. [in English] Circle around. [engine revving] What's your problem? I knew I couldn't trust you. Bro, you are paranoid. Shit. Incoming! [helicopter blades thumping] Cover fire. Must be them! Go, go, go. Copy! [dramatic score] [gunshots] [in Chinese] Dragon Luo, there's suspicious mercenaries and they're firing on us! Let's go. Head east. [in Chinese] Yan, join up with the rest of the team and head to the Green Zone. I'll meet you there. [in Chinese] Copy. [in Chinese] HaiMing, get the convoy rolling. [in Chinese] Copy. [engine revving] [gunshot] [beeping] [whizzing] [engines revving] I just lost my lead. Etch-a-Sketch, you're up, you take point. It's Knox! [heavy weapon firing] Cyclops, push ahead and set up an ambush. My name is Knox! Shit! [heavy weapon firing] He's moving too fast. Hold on! [boom] Tomb Raider, cover me now. Tramp Stamp, I'm drawing this helo away and you stay behind and take it out! [tires skidding] We need to keep going. We got no chance with that thing in the air. You take care of the bird. I'll get 'em to the exchange site. Copy! Set. Tramp Stamp, take it out. [helicopter blades whirring] I'm out. [rapid beeping] [Tomb Raider] I'm out. We're clear. Goddammit, Knox, take your shot! [rapid beeping] I got it. [in Chinese] We're going down. [engine revving] [engine idling] [dramatic score] [engine revving] Commander. Look. Go! [wind howling] [in Chinese] You're going down like this? Be careful. [frightened exclamations] [dramatic score] Five. [in Chinese] Wei. [in Chinese] Dragon Luo, they took five people with them. Azir, five missing. I need Mei down here. [Henry] What's going on? Who hired us? - Unicorp. - Don't lie to me, Henry! What are you mixed up in? Go easy on him, Chris. [dramatic score] It's like you said, no one works harder than me. Owen? [Owen laughing] [helicopter blades thumping] [excited chatter] [in Chinese] Hey, Mei, they took Professor Cheng and her assistant. [in Chinese] What? [Cheng gasps] Professor Ying Cheng. Finally. I'm very, very thankful you could make it. Have we met? No, I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure until now. I hope my men didn't cause too many problems for you. It was you attacking our refinery? Please understand, professor, it's not personal. Knox! Let's talk. [indistinct chatter] I've been all over this country. You know what I've found? This isn't a desert. Everything here is a gold mine. And I'm wiping the company out, Chris. What? I watched them get rich while I busted my ass off. Sixteen years of false promises. [sighs] I even gave up having a family for them. And for what? Nothing. But now it's my turn. I'm taking this war private. I'm taking back what they owe me. What they owe us. Listen, Owen, what you got going on here that's your business. It's between you and her. Hm. Dragon Luo is leading the Chinese security team. He's gonna come after the professor. If you can keep him off my tail, I can make you rich. Not interested. I just want my money. When the job is done. The job is done. Henry said dropping... Henry's young and desperate! You can't trust people who are desperate. It's our time. You don't want to pass this up, my friend. And remember, no money, no water. Selfish son of a bitch. I'm selfish? [dramatic score] You know what selfish is? Staying here and hiding. I'm done with you. Whatever you want. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're just gonna let him walk? He's your brother. You stop him. Chris, wait. I-I need to collect our money and we gotta finish. Get out of here while you still can. [engine starts, rumbles] Well, go on then. Quit. Just like you did when you bailed on our old man. [engine revving] Be at the village at 1600 sharp. Bring the rest of my money and don't be late. [revs engine] [tires skidding] Owen. We don't need him. I can handle this Dragon Luo guy on my own. You failed, Henry. That makes me so sad. [dramatic score] [metallic ting] [grunts] Stop! We need the hostages. Idiot. Take him back to the radio tower and make it look like Chinese payback, okay? Also, close the loop on Henry's bullshit with the French. We can't have them interfering with the plan. Let's go! [man yelling in Arabic] Hey. [dramatic score] Follow that car. Copy, sir. What's up ahead? I don't know. [in Chinese] There's a village there in Area Four. But it's dangerous. Follow him. We're low on fuel. I can make it, but that's it. [in Chinese] You stay in the helicopter, okay? [dune buggy engine revving] [breathing heavily] [sighs] [Arabic conversations in distance] [loud grunt] [glass tinkling on floor] Chris, we play. [tense score] [goat bleating] [indistinct conversations] [Chris] Almost, bud, almost. [groans] Come on, Henry. That took a bad hop, took a bad hop. Oh! [dramatic score] You lost? I come for my people. What are you doing in my village? What are you doing in the desert? I'm fishing. What are you doing in the desert? [cell phone rings] [in Chinese] Hello? I'm fine. I'm playing baseball with a bangchui (idiot). I came for my people. You got the wrong guy. Chris, we play. [goat bleating] Whoa. [tense score becomes more gentle] You caught it, Funhouse. That was awesome. [Soraya in Arabic] I told you many times to behave yourself. You will get punished next time. [in English] Chris, where are you going? I'm going to get our money. I won't be long. Okay. [engine revving] [goats bleating] [dramatic score] [approaching footsteps] [retreating footsteps] [dramatic score] [gear selector into park] [door squeaks] Yo! [doors squeak] [dramatic boom] [earpiece clicking] [score fades out] [blowing wind] [Chris sighs] [tender score] See you on the other side, bro. [hook and loop fastener ripping] [feet scuffling] [tense score] [pistol rattling] [grunts and groans] [exciting score] Why are you following me? Why are you in the desert? [bones cracking] [whoosh] Oh! Ah! [blade rings] [grunts] [grunts and efforts] [groans] [whoosh] Ah. - [grunts] - [blade rings] [blade rings] Ah! [whooshing] You killed my people. Ahh, I didn't kill anyone. Yes, you did. Oh! Ow! Uh! I know it's you. How? Fishing in the desert? Really? [grunting] Listen to me. Listen to me. (grunts) You killed my people. They killed your people. They killed my brother too. [in French] What's going on here? Where is my money? [in French] Hello. You speak French? That's all. Where is my money, Mr. America? For the weapons. Looking for money? - Get in line. - [pin rings] Hurry up. I think they're gonna shoot you. Why? Because the first time I see you, I wanted to shoot you. [in French] Start shooting! See? Go! [dramatic score] Shit-shit-shit-shit! - Magazine! - What?! Magazine! Here! [automatic gunfire] Hey! Bullets? What kind of bullets? Seven six two. Seven six two. Seven six two. Seven six two. - What are you doing? - I'm loading for you! Just give 'em to me! Ah. Here! - [bullets tinkling] - [grunts] Hey! - What? - Forget it! Grenade! Give me a grenade! Yeah, grenade. You get it! What are you, crazy? What? Too dangerous. You're closer. Me go? Go! Shit, shit. [grunting] Here we go, come on, come on, come on! Who killed my people? What? Come on. [bullets ricocheting] Who are they? - It wasn't them. - What? Come on. Hurry up, grenade! I gotta find it! It's in the bin. What? In the bin. Pull the pin? Okay, here! [high-pitched ringing] Huh? Why'd you pull the pin, man? - Pull the pin? - I said "the bin." I pulled the pin already. [score fades out] - [Chris grunts] - Wait-wait-wait-wait. What?! [gentle wind] I think they're gone. [gentle wind] How do you know? No more shooting. Take a look. You look. - You. - You look! You closer. Yeah, I think they're gone. Don't look one direction. [sighs] [tense score] - [gunshot] - [Chris grunts] [bullet casing tinkles to floor] Who killed my people? You ever give up? No. Who are they? You shoot me, you're never gonna find out. Gotta go check on my truck. Hey. [breathes out through teeth] [door squeaks] [truck pulling away] [score fades out] [heavy breathing] Oh. You have flat tire. Ethel. Your car has a name? Yeah. Is that weird? Come on. - Can't leave the weapons. - Or the bodies. It's weird. [exciting score] Owen Paddock runs everything for Unicorp. He's got your people. Which company? This company? No, that one. Get in the car. Hey, no time! Come on, come on, come on. Hey, where's he taken them? I don't know. But it's too dangerous to do anything here at night. Even for you. [rapid beeping] [faster beeping] [metal creaking, groaning] [boom] [boom] [Luo sighs] By the way, what's your name? [in Chinese] It's bangchui (idiot), isn't it? Huh? [in Chinese] You can speak Chinese? - [laughing] - [in Chinese] Yes, I can. Let go! Where you learn Chinese? [in Chinese] I was in Shanghai working for a dead man company. [in Chinese] What? [in Chinese] A dead man company. [in Chinese] Dead man company? Yes, private security. [in Chinese, slowly, enunciating] It's pronounced private security company. Not "funeral parlor". Private security company. First tone, not third tone. [in Chinese] Private security company. You speak English! [tense score] [warning beeps] [Irish accent] The refinery is protected by quantum encryption. [warning beeps] It's not happening without the dongle. All right, professor, I need you to get the oil flowing. Where's the dongle? You're gonna steal our oil. [keyboard clacking] [warning beeps] [tense score] Some of my men, my... friends have died and their families, they didn't get anything, so... I'm just taking back what they owe us. You're gonna help me. You're stealing. [chuckles] I think everyone is stealing from this country. We buy it. I also need the codes, please. It's a very complex process and there's not... [gasps] - [shell casing clatters] - [body thuds] Please continue. Paper. Yeah, with the codes, right? Yes. And the dongle? Dongle. Dongle. Where are they? [gunshot] - [body thuds] - [shell casing clatters] [gasps] Why would I kill you when I can kill your son? [gasps] No! Everything in my bag. Where's the bag? No, I don't know where is it! Where's the bag? It's not with me right now. I don't know where is it! No, please, please! No, please trust me... I'm so sorry. It's not with me. Track her phone! [Cheng breathes raggedly] Her phone. It's in her bag. [Cheng] Pho... Go get the bag. [cell phone ringing] [indistinct conversations in Arabic] [Mei in Chinese] Hello? Big dog!

[in Arabic] Thank you. [crackling] Why take two buses? You only needed bus eight. Distraction. Hey, man, your friend dropped her book. I'm no idiot, I don't see any chemistry there between you two so I figured I would use the book as like an in, you know. I mean, I put my number in the back or something, 'cause I mean, look at her, man. She is hot. That booty. I mean, I'm no freak kind of guy but... She's my daughter. Huh... [Chris clears throat nervously] Uh, of course she is. I... You... Now that you mention it, she... She looks just like you. She is your daughter. How did I not see that? [gentle, poignant score] Mei and I, complicated. Her mother died. For Mei, maybe I'm dead, too. Wait, you said you never give up. In war, yes. In life, not so easy. Why are you here? Yeah. Me and my brother used to work for my dad. Private contractors? Yeah. Damn good too. Every one of us, Special Ops. Two years ago, my old man got a job on the Highway of Death. Turned it down. First time I ever heard him say it. So I convinced him to take it. And we... drove right into a rebel ambush. Forty-eight hour firefight. In the end, I... hatched up a plan to get us out of there. I-I-I needed to hold the line so my dad could move. But I signaled to him that I needed to move. And we both moved at the same time. And everybody got wasted. My dad got killed right there in front of me. Your father and your men, they died because it was their time. This is the life we choose. Don't look for reasons why. Yeah, before, man, we... fought for honor or a flag or something. I fight for my family, my people, my country. That's all. They were my family. The village is your family now. By the way, what's your real name? It's not bangchui (idiot). It's Chris. [dog barking] Sh! [dramatic score] [closer dog barking] Get the kids in the classroom, now. Okay. Go, go, go! Come on, come on, hurry. [children clamoring] [beeping] You go high, I'll go low. Okay. [sharp exhale] [Chris grunts] [rifle clatters away] [tense score] [grunts] [pounding energetic score] [grunts and efforts] - [Knox] Where is it? - [Luo] Where's what? [Chris] Hey! [yelling] [Luo yelling] I'm okay. You okay? - Get off me. - Okay. [breathing heavily] Did you say, "I go high, you go low?" I did go low. Then I went high. Okay, from now on, no more talking. Hand signal. You know hand signal, right? Shit. [tense score] - [exciting score] - [grunts] [yells] Good signal, huh? [whispered] Hey. Six, six. Six o'clock! [bullets ricocheting] Can't you read the signal? What signal? Let's go. Don't you know what this means? Yeah, call you, have a beer, relax. What do you mean? One, two, three, four, five, six, six o'clock. How does that mean six? Just say, "Behind you." This time you go high, I go low. [frustrated grunt] Go! Remember, bangchui (idiot). [energetic score] [both grunting] [groan] Shit! Ah! [thud] [yells] [grunts and groans] [masonry clattering] [groan] Chris! Give me your phone. The phone! Gimme the phone! Hey, you looking for this? [rifle rattling] Looks like we got ourselves an old-fashioned standoff. Look, here's your tracking device but you don't know where the girl is and you're not gonna find her. [grenade pin clatters to ground] I'm only here for the bag. The bag? Hey, where are you going? Ah, no, no! What are you doing? Chris! Hey. What are you doing? [in Chinese] This is my family! I protect this village! If they want that bag, I'll just give them that bag. You speak... [in Chinese] You can speak Chinese? Yes, that's how mad I am right now. [emotional score] [Luo sighs] What's so important about that bag anyway? The bag has the USB key and the passwords to open the flow from the refinery. How much oil? Millions of barrels. Yeah, who cares? To get that much oil out of the refinery they'd need like... 500 trucks and then they gotta drive it to the coast. There is an underground network that flows across the country. That's what those pipes are for? [tense score] [rooster crows in distance] They use the pipes and fill tankers. Each tanker holds a 100 million in oil. That would make it... The biggest oil heist in history. We gotta get to the refinery. But we need something that can drive through the gate. I got something. You in position yet? We're on the station. Standing by. [Owen] Copy. [captain] Gentlemen, prepare to dock. [dramatic score] [in Chinese] I'm coming too! I know the refinery better than you do. I can help you guys. [in Chinese] It's dangerous there. You should wait here. [Luo sighs gently] [tender score] I promise, I'll come back for you. [in Chinese] Fine. Be careful. The refinery is very flammable. Don't use guns. You have to remember never to use guns. [in Chinese] Okay. - Take it s... - Shut up. Okay, you're right, you're right. [truck door opens, closes] [truck door opens] Hey, put your seat belt on. Safety first. [grunts] [groans] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Slow and put in the hole. Yeah, see? So easy. [seatbelt clicks] You happy? Happy. We can go. Let's go. [truck engine revving] [rousing score] Get working. Now. [beep] Fingerprint, please. [beeping] And passcode. Seven, nine, four, two. [beeps] [loud clang] [equipment powering up] [in Arabic] I hear it turning on. Start filling! It's flowing. We're a go. [sloshing and burbling] [dramatic score] It'll take 24 hours. I know. I'm not an idiot. Let's fill the trucks. Get moving. -They're being filled. Once we cross into the demilitarized zone they can't touch us. [dramatic score] [in Arabic] Enemy approaching! Enemy approaching! Fire! [bullets ricocheting] [bullets ricocheting] Hey! [both grunt] [bullets ricocheting] [engine roars] [automatic gunfire] [yelling] Oil truck! [metal creaking, groaning] [man yells] [heavy breathing] [exciting score] [crackling] Follow me. [Luo grunts] [efforts and grunts] Ah. [grunts and efforts] [yell] Sorry. See? [machete rings] [dramatic score] [machete clangs] What are you doing? So they can't stop it. We're rolling out. You stay here and watch the hostages. But kill them once the tankers are full. [dramatic score] [machete rings] [grunts and groans] [machetes ring] [mercenary yells] [machete rings] [grunt] Jump! I can't jump. Hold on! Whoo! Thank you. Yah! [Owen] Dragon Luo! It's an honor to meet you. It's a shame you have to do this on your own. I'm not alone. [machete rings] [metal squeaking] [machete rings] [whooshing] Oh! - There's a... - Huh? - Few more. You'll be fine. - What? Come up when you're done. [clang] [groans] [thud] [dramatic score] [magazine skitters across floor] [Knox] Help them. - [thud] - Ah! [grunt] [glass tinkling] [firearm rattling] [crunching] [whoosh] I got Skullface. [in Chinese] All right. Professor, let's go! [gunshot] Hurry up! [pistol clicking] [exciting score] Hey, magazine. Magazine. Catch! - [exasperated sigh] - Really? Come on. [magazine clicks] Clear. [ricochets] [pistol clicks] [objects clattering] Hey, Knox, I've been racking my brain this whole time to try to think of a perfect nickname for you. Sharpie Head or One-Eyed Trouser Snake Daddy Issues... But I just figured out right now the perfect nickname for you. [in Chinese] Dead Man. - You know why? - [rifle clicks] 'Cause you out of bullets. [dramatic score] [grunting] [glass tinkling to floor] [groans] You go, I got this. - You sure? - Sure! All right. Hey! Everyone head out to the DMZ. [dramatic score] [vehicle engines revving] Let's go. [engine revving] [tires squealing] [rhythmic grunting] [groaning] [heavy breathing] [grunt] That settles it. [engines revving] More cardio starting Monday. Ah... [truck horn honking repeatedly] [repeated honking] Susie? That's my truck. [tires screeching] I'm gonna kill him. [tires screeching] I swear I'm gonna kill him. I don't want to... [grunts] Mei? Where's my father? Why are you driving Susie? Who? Stay in the car. [dramatic score] Let's go. [car door closes] [tires squealing] [glass tinkling] [hub cap rolling away] Sorry. [sighs] Drive. [gear selector grinding] [engine revving] [gears grinding] [tires squealing] You keep a machine gun under the seat? American. Guns everywhere. [exclamations and grunts] [in Chinese] Professor, leave now. [grunt] Easy, easy. - [transmission grinding] - Oh! There goes the new clutch. Shift. Shift. Yes, I'm trying, but the transmission is loose. Loose? Don't listen to her, Susie. Hold on. [engine revs] [dramatic score] [squeaking] Oh! [groaning and coughing] [groan] Contact, six o'clock. [rapid beeping] [locking on beeps] How do you work these? [ricochets] Start swerving. [tires squealing] Oh, Chris. [clicking] [Knox] Ah! [grunt] [muffled audio] [normal audio] Yah! Hyah! Ooh! [grunts and efforts] Oh. Yah! Yah! Aah! [whooshing] [thuds] [ricochets] [tires squealing] Shit! Aw, come on. We're out of bullets. They're out. Take her off the road, now! [engine revving] Let's see if she's ready now, Chris. [tires squealing] Follow them. She can handle it. - Okay. - [gears grinding] [tires squealing] [Susie clattering] [Knox exclaims] [thud] [sloshing] [Knox exclaims] - [sloshing] - Ah! [grunts and groans] Hm? Ah! [clasps engaging] Hey, hey, hey! [yelling] [sighs] [rattling] Faster. Go, go, go, go, go, go. [gunshot] They're still behind us. Faster! [gunshots] [heavy breathing] [in Chinese] Your nickname shouldn't be "Dead Man." You look more like a frozen Peking duck. [chuckles] [door opening] Professor? Professor? Professor? Professor? [in Chinese] They broke the dongle and I can't shut the refinery down. It's all up to you now. [in Chinese] Stay here. I will be back right away. [clicking] [fan whines] [blows through lips] [rattling] Come on. Go! Go. No, no, no, no. Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. [Owen] Whoo! [rattling] [engine revving] - No, no, we'll never make it! - No, we'll make it. - You don't have a chance. - Just trust me. - [gears grinding] - No! [Chris yells] [clattering] [metal creaking] [metal groaning] [thud] [sand and gravel pattering] [loose tire bouncing] [silence] [loud dramatic score] [engines revving] [Mei clears throat, coughs] S-sorry, Susie. Sorry? Get away! Sorry, what are you...? [spluttering] [screams] [scream echoes] [motor revving] Hey! Slow down! - Dad! - Can't you see me? - Slow down! - [tires skidding] Stop! I see you have a... Make a flat tire joke, swear I'm gonna lose it. [air brakes hiss] I just want to say let's go. Good. Seatbelt. [grunting] Hey, hey. Hey, hey-hey. [metal clanging] [dramatic score] We're gonna catch him. Shortcut, nine o'clock. - What? - What? That's eight. That's an eight? What do you mean? -This is nine. That's not a nine! It looks like a baby pirate hand. - Argh! - Okay-okay, no more hand signal, okay? Go that way. [engines revving] Gotta go faster. That's as fast as I can go. [clattering] Not if we use the jet. How? If I were you, I'd hold on. [jet firing up] [jet whining] [whoosh] [Chris] Aah! Stop the trucks! Stop the trucks now! [groaning] [boom] Hit the back, not the middle. Okay! Aah! [metal groaning] [Luo moaning] [engine revving] [metal clattering] [metal creaking] [engines revving] [driver screams] No...! [metal clattering] [crackling and sizzling] [grunts] Morgan, hey!

[tires skidding] [gasps] Get the outriggers out. [in Chinese] Extend the outriggers down! [in Chinese] Which switch? - Where's the button? - By the wheel. [in Chinese] By the wheel! [beeps] I got this, you drive. [engine sputtering, whining, backfiring] [grunts] You gonna run? No. Get on. [ratcheting] [stirring score] [in Chinese] Seatbelt? - [Mei in Chinese] Yes. - [Luo] Ready? Hit it! Hold tight! [dramatic score] - [in Chinese] Go. - [in Chinese] Go. [jet firing up] [groaning] [engine sputtering] [roaring] [Mei groans] [Owen] Aah! Jump on the count of five. I can't hear you! Five! What?! [metal wires snapping] I know you said no more hand signals! This is an exception! [Owen yells] [Mei gasps] Four! Three! [Owen yells] Two! [pin clangs] Jump! [Mei yells] [Luo] Aah! [both gasp] [grunts and groans] [gasping] [Mei] Ah. [Luo grunts] [booming explosion] [Mei gasps] [Luo grunts] [rocks clattering] [chuckling] [laughs heartily] [sighs] [calms breathing] Huh. [in Chinese] Don't be scared. I'm here. I am with you. [engine turns over and rumbles] [revs engine] [revving engine several times] [tires scrabbling in dirt and rocks] [screaming] [Mei and Luo screaming] [Luo gasps] [Owen screaming] [chuckles] [gasping] [Luo grunting] [Luo grunts] [thudding boom] [both grunting and gasping] [both breathing heavily] [bird screeches in distance] [bird screeches in distance] [in Chinese] Where is Chris? Chris! Chris! Chris! [tense score] [bird cawing in distance] Chris. [emotional score] [blowing wind] [heavy exhales] [in Chinese] How did you get my diary? [in Chinese] You two have always been with me. [in Chinese] Dad? I understand now. [tender score] - [grunt] - [dramatic score hit] Chris! It's a beautiful moment but I really could use a hand. [grunts and efforts] [Mei] Chris! [grunts and groans] I thought you'd never make it. - Oh. - [Mei] Are you okay? You too. Oh, I'm scared-scared of heights. I mean [laughing] I'm alive, I'm alive! Oh, and I'm totally single and now is a good time for me to say that I'm disease-free, too. - Uh-huh. - Uh, I had a scare with hepatitis, but it turned out to be nothing. It was a cold. Hey. [in Chinese] Don't even think about it, bangchui (idiot). [in Chinese] But I thought we're family. [in Chinese] We are not family. How do you think you even stand a chance with my daughter? What? What does that mean? You have a lot to learn. Okay, Confucius, you know everything, right? How do we get out of here? I have idea. [all] Help!! [echoing] Help!! [Chris] Really?

I got this. - You sure? - Yeah. Wrong hand. - Yeah? - Yeah. - This one? - Yes. Oh. [female assistant director] One more. I'm wiping the company out, Chris. Yeah, no shit, Captain Obvious. You got a bunch of Arabs in Ninja masks bleeding this place dry. And while you're wiping the company out, you know what I'm doing? - No. - You told me to date a little more, so uh, see Father Time over there with the AK 47? - Yeah. - We've been talking online. I met him through an app called Finder. I thought it was "find her" but it's really a "finder" app. We share a lot of commonalities. We both live in small villages, proficient with firearms. Both watched Lawrence of Arabia. Come on! [grunt] [clicking] Hey, hey. Come on! [grunt] - Hey. - Come on! - [magazine clicks into grip] - Go! My man. [chuckles] Look at her, man. She is hot. That booty. I'm the type of guy to bend that over and... smack that ass. I mean, Whoo... I'm a freak. I will eat some ass. I will stay down there. You know what they call that?

[helicopter blades thumping] [clattering] Cut! That's a nine. Uh, eight, now... Just avoid the nine. No more hand signal. Oh! Go over there. One more. You, your two hands all block my, my face. - One more. - [laughing] How was that nine? That looks like a baby pirate hand. Okay, here real quick: what's a pirate's favorite letter? What? R? No, you would think it's the R, but it's the "C." He steal my shot. He just keeps saying dialogue. [all laughing] I don't even know what you saying. [closing credit score]
