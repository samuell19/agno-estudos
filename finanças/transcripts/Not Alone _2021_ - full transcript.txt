Get out! Grandma. Grandma! Hail Mary full of grace. The Lord is with thee blessed are thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Glad you could make it. Come in. Hold on, sport. Hi Lu. It's so nice to finally meet you in person. This is my son, Tommy. Hi Lu. I'm the sperm donor. Nice to meet you. That's my husband Walter. And this is my oldest, Jess. Hi. Hi. This is it, huh? Yeah, it is. Wow, it's even more beautiful than the pictures. Wait until you see the backyard and the pool. It has a top over it for now, but once it's cleaned, wow. This place is like a dream house. The owners moved back to China. So basically they're looking to get rid of it. Plus the home is mostly furnished so you can keep whatever you want. Makes you wonder why nobody's bought it yet. Well, you're the first family that I've shown the property to ever since we decided to cut the price. Yeah, yeah. I just don't get why you'd reduce it by so much, that's all. Consider it a blessing. Follow me. Tommy? Tommy? Mom? Mom! Mom! Tommy, what is it? Ewe. Tommy, are you okay? What's with the dead chicken? Probably neighborhood kids. It looks like witchcraft. Kids are always getting into mischief. How did someone get in here? Vacant house, kids. I probably left the door open. Sounds to me, Lu, like it's going to cost a lot to upgrade the security system. That's really going to cut into our signing budget. Well, if you name the price for your house, you could always compensate yourself for the inconvenience. See honey, she speaks your language. Let's not worry about this and continue on with the tour. Come. I want to show you the massage tub. She speaks my language too. Let's not worry about this. Great. Dad, dad, dad, look, the crystals are starting to come in. Not now, Tommy. I'll take a look at it later, okay. Hey, hey, please don't put that over there. Hey Jess, check this out. Nevermind. Mom, check this out. Oh, not right now, Tommy. Go show your dad. But I already showed dad. Do you have a moment? Yeah, just a second. Honey, I'll promise, I'll check it out in a minute, okay. Did you see a box cutter around here? Neon green. No, but I'll keep an eye out for it. Mom, somethings wrong with the pool. What do you mean? Something weird is in there. Ugh. That not pretty. Well, we'll call it pool cleaner next week. I wonder if Lu will pay for that. Seriously, honey. You know we got the house for a steal. Come on, we did her a favor. I know you say I'm a conniving lawyer, but she wanted to get rid of it. Come on, champ, pizza time. I'll get it. Hi, I'm Connor with Florida Sun Pool Care. Hi, come on in. I need to grab some equipment from my truck. Can I, can I meet you around back? Yeah, yeah, of course. So this is it. Can I get you anything to drink? Like lemonade or water? Thanks. Water would be great. I should probably get to work. Right, right. Yeah. Mom, mom! What happened? I don't know, I just found him like that. Oh god. - Say something. - Wake up! Thank god. Mom, what is that? Thank you, Mr. Lawson. I'll take a look at the security footage and get back to you. You can keep that one. I have a backup. Good news is pool boy is going to be okay. Sure there's nothing else you can recall, Mrs. Lawson? No, that's it. To be honest, this whole thing isn't too different from the last time we was sent out here. Wait, this has happened before? Well, not exactly like this. Your real estate agent didn't tell you about that? No. Oh yeah. Oh, Lu been trying to do something about them disturbances for months. Disturbances? You don't know about the disturbances? Does this have anything to do with a threatening letter I found in my mailbox? When was that? Today, telling us to leave. We're not aware of any letters. What are we supposed to do about all this? She mentioned anything about cleansing rituals? Cleansing rituals? I know this is odd but in this community, they perform cleansing rituals on properties before they're sold. That way a new family moving in can start with a clean slate. You're right that sounds odd. You need to contact Lu for more questions about that. So that's it? I mean, what about the letter? If you get another letter, station number's on the report, we're only a few minutes away. Okay. I guess. You have a good day now, ma'am. Can you believe this? It's unbelievable. Hello, you've reached Lu Dantica. Please leave your name, number, and a detailed message and I'll respond promptly. Thank you. Hi Lu, it's Shelley Lawson calling you again. I would really appreciate you calling me back. It's an emergency. I don't know why the reception has to be so bad out here, too. I mean seriously. I know. Where are they? My proof, would you believe it? If I told you where, would you go and look? We only bear witness by sight. If we only knew that our own vision keeps us in the darkness, unable to truly see. But Dr. Clay, you claim that you've almost caught one. That's right. Rest assured I will have something for the world to see very soon. I'm flying out to a very promising lead in Alabama this evening. There's an older gentleman who was having an experience when... So full of crap. I'm sick and tired of suffering through your delusions of grandeur. I'm sick of it. My findings aren't delusional, they are real. We're all supposed to just take your word for it? I mean anybody listing. Oh, I saw it with my own eyes. I'm laughing at you. Everybody's laughing at you. Are you gonna give us verifiable data that we can all check and measure or not? Until then, you are not doing real science. Hey mom. You beat me to the punch. Yeah. I was just checking on you. Today was a little crazy. Yeah, I know. I'm really glad he didn't die though. He was really cute. CF girls don't get too many chances to meet guys. You'll meet someone, honey. He'll be lucky to have you. Yeah. Well he'd better hurry up cause I've got 20 years max. Jess, stop it. Mom, you're being uber sensitive. What about you? Are you okay? Me? Yeah, of course. Sure you are. What do you mean by that? Well, at night I hear you walk around the house, checking on me and Tommy. Kind of creepy. Get a hold of Lu yet? No. I even tried calling from Jess' phone. Got nothing. She's avoiding me. She's hiding something. Yeah, you think so? Maybe because of the disturbances. Yeah. You know I'm not a scientist or anything, but maybe there's an electric eel in the pool. You think that's funny? That kid could have died. My guess is it's probably due to some faulty equipment on his part. At least I hope so because Florida slip and fall laws are just brutal. We'd be on the hook for so much. Have you been getting up in the night checking on the kids? No, why? What is it? Just forget it. Shit! Walter! Walter, there's something in the pool! What? What happened? It grabbed my leg and I don't know. Something's in there. Mom, what's wrong? Something's in the pool. Honey. Honey, no. Why not? Walter? Walter. Honey? Walter. There you go. See mom, it was just a branch. It wasn't a branch. What was it then? I don't know. All right, new rule. Nobody goes into the pool until after we've had it cleaned. You wouldn't catch me dead in there anyways. Mom? How? Will it hurt? Mom? Weird. That's not good. What is that? Hello, you've reached Lu Dantica. Please leave your name, number and a detailed message and I'll respond promptly. Thank you. Any luck? No, they said Lu's on vacation. Are you picking up dinner? Yeah, I'm here now. Guys? Guys. Get ready for dinner. Tommy? Jess? Jess? Tommy? Tommy, Jess! Tommy, Jess! Tommy. Honey, you need to answer me when I'm calling for you. If you can't hear me, you're listening to your music way too loud. Sorry. I just don't understand. I think Jess has been messing with my experiment. Well, I can go find her and ask her. You know where she is? Maybe her room. Come with me now to witness a tale from beyond our world. Jess. Did you hear me? I'm home. Who's ready for dinner? Jessica! Jessica! Walter, call 911! We don't know what she's contracted. And she's still in a coma. She's in isolation. We're just going to have to wait for the rest of the test to come back. It may take a while. We're sending it off to CDC. What if Tommy's next? I understand that you're upset, but you have to be logical about this. We only came here for Jess' health in the first place, the air, the climate. Dr. Hardy recommended this place for a reason, right? Something wants us out. So now you're saying this house is haunted. I mean, where's the sanity in that? It's just this feeling I have. Something's not right. I should have done this a long time ago. I'm going to prove to you that this is all a coincidence. How is this even possible that there's no way the police actually watched this. Even if they did, what would they do? They didn't even care when they were out here. They could at least investigate. I'm Lisa Haskins. I was abducted. That's what we need to do. ♪ And at last ♪ My name is Shelly Lawson. I'm an artist and a mother. And we moved to Cassadaga, Florida about a month ago. We do not know what is going on in our home. We've been having lights flickering, water faucets turning on, doors left open, water on the floor, people getting hurt. I know this makes me sound crazy by saying this, I think our house is haunted by something. If any of you out there have seen anything like this, please contact us. We need your help. Bingo. I just don't understand how you're so relaxed about all this. Do I sound like I'm relaxed? No. What are you going to do at the hospital? You're just going to end up getting overstressed and then I'm going to have to take care of you and the kids. Maybe you're right. My God, I'm losing my mind. Oh my god. I know exactly what is going on in your home. Call me as soon as possible, day or night. My number is below. Respectfully, Dr. James Clay. Hi James. Please contact me. Hello? Mrs. Lawson, that video that you posted, can you confirm for me that you saw everything with your own eyes? I did. You mind if I ask you a few more questions? Go ahead. Is your service always this bad? It's a, it's a serious question. Only around the house. And electrical disturbances, is, is your electrical service usually bad? I mean any fluctuations in the home? It's really a problem. It really has. Are you near a body of water? Well, I have a pool. Do you notice any oddities occur when you make a high pitch sound? No. Interesting. Okay, and matter. I'll be paying you a visit tomorrow. Listen, your online profile indicates that you are in Florida. Is that correct? Yes, but who are you and how can you help us? I'm probably the only person on the planet that can help you. Now how I do it depends on many variables. You have a sizeable property, correct? Yeah, that's right. Good. I'm going to set up shop there for however long it takes. I cannot invite a perfect stranger into my house. All due respect, but I am not the stranger that you have to be worried about. What? Well, this thing is not just going to disappear. I mean, do you want to protect your family or not? I do, but... Good. Then it's settled. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Hold on, wait. Look, I've got a long drive ahead of me. So just text me the address and I'll see you tomorrow morning. Good night. Good night, Mrs. Lawson. Hello, you've reached Lu Dantica. Please leave your name, number and a detailed message and I will respond promptly. Thank you. Why are you avoiding me? Because I didn't know what to say. The reception is bad here. Mind coming to your back gate? Do you have kids? Yes. Well, I hope you never have to experience what I'm going through. My children are not safe. Look, I am sorry. Sorry. The cops told me you know all about this. I didn't want to mention it. You guys are out of towners and I didn't want to scare you with talk about voodoo and spirits and things. Oh, so you lied! Look, I can't tell you exactly what's happening inside of your house, but... It attacked my daughter. Now she's in the hospital. Hear me out. We Haitians believe in spirits. So as a real estate agent, I usually perform a cleansing ritual on every place whenever someone moves out. And they usually go well except for this one. My husband's a powerful attorney. You better hope your license is the only thing taken from you. Dr. Clay. Oh, Mrs. Lawson. So where are these occurrences taking place? I'll show you, but first we should have dinner. If you don't mind, I'd like to get straight to work. Dr. Clay, I know you're here to give us answers and we are, we appreciate it. But I have a lot of questions myself and I just, I just like to talk to you first. Mrs. Lawson, what we're dealing with does not afford us time to be leisurely. We have to be immediate. And I, and I understand that, but it would make us feel more comfortable having a stranger in our home if they weren't one. You know what I mean? Yeah, I suppose. Would you mind if I set up my equipment in the garage? Sure. I'll show you to it. And you can also drop your bags off in the guest house, okay. You know, if it's all right with you, I'll just, I'll just keep to my van. Are you sure? I mean the guest house is much more comfortable. The caravan will be just fine. Dr. Clay, dinner's ready. Okay. Sorry. It's been a while since I've had a home cooked meal. No worries. Food is made to be eaten. I want to thoroughly explain what's going on in your home. Come. A number of years ago, I made contact with an old recluse who claimed that his house was being haunted. He complained of loud noises, electrical disturbances, objects that moved from one fixed position to another was caused by a Poltergeist. With my instruments, I made contact with something that was far more stunning. Wow. Looks like the pool guy but gnarlier. Indeed. So, what's it like being a scientist? I'm growing crystals using borax and water. Good for you. Keep it up. Being a scientist is invigorating. Science and mathematics, it gives meaning to everything. Well, not everything, right? Everything. Well, science and math help us gain context and understanding of the world around us, but it doesn't give them meaning. Art will never get us to the stars. Well, aren't we already among them? Is art going to fix this situation? Dr. Clay, our daughter has a blue mold all over her body. Does that mean anything to you? I've never encountered anything like that. What are the white coats saying? They don't know what's going on. They have her in quarantine right now. Did you tell them that I was here? No. Why? Good. Because I don't want them to interfere. After I sequestered, I'll be happy to share any information I get that can help your daughter, but please let's be very clear about this. It is paramount that I make the first announcement. I'll, I, I'll keep it secret where I found it. But the last thing you need is the media to turn this place into a, into a tourist attraction. Dr. Clay, what's in our house? Mr. and Mrs. Lawson, it is not a spirit which resides in this house. It is what I call an IDB. It is an inter dimensional being. An alien, you kidding me? Why is that any less believable than the concept of a spirit? This is just too much. First, there's ghosts, and then voodoo priestesses, and now we're talking about aliens? I am beyond serious. I'm going to have to teach you two a lesson. My ears! Will you stop that? Dr. Clay! Holy fuck, he's right. These creatures have long been sighted in the Gulf and the Caribbean. My Haitian grandfather used to tell me about them when I was a kid. In these small Haitian villages, they're called the Loraj Lavi.. I didn't believe it until my grandfather got killed by one of these things on his way back to his childhood village. These creatures seek out pools of water for cell generation and thermal regulation. This is the reason why it's in your pool. Now, I'm sure that it's also feeding on photosynthetic organisms as well. But in spite of that, it needs it, it prefers freshwater. Your home provides cover, safety, food, and an abundance of fresh water. It is marked your home as its territory. Hey, are you all still with me? Yeah. These beings can harness the electromagnetic force. It can also cloak itself from visible light. Now this is not its most astounding attribute. I postulate that this creature has achieved micro dimensional mastery, which gives it the power of an omega minus civilization. I know what that is. Omega minus civilization means you can do cool shit like traveled through wormholes. Tommy. He reminds me when I was a kid and I was studying the laws of the universe. By understanding this creature, we not only discover edge of the universe, but we become explorers of the multi-verse and our species will live beyond time itself. It's a lot to swallow. The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you. You have seen the unbelievable with your own eyes. What happened to the one that did that? He escaped into another dimension. These creatures possess a supreme adaptive behavior for survival. They're extraordinarily cunning. And so far they've escaped my efforts. But this time I'm prepared. I just want to get rid of it. Understandably so. Well, thank you for dinner. It's high time that I get to work. Now I suggest that you all lock yourself in a room and don't come out until the morning. Hate to see somebody else go to the hospital. Good night. Good night. Mom, is Dr. Clay going to protect us from the alien? Yes. But what if it kills him and comes for us? That not going to happen, Tommy. How do you know? Because I won't let it. Your father and I asked Dr. Clay to come because he's a professional. He'll get rid of it by the morning. Everything's going to be fine. What the fuck? What's going on? Shit. Where you at? Where are you? Huh? Shit. What's going on? Hey, get back in there! It's too dangerous out here. What the heck is going on? Oh baby, I got your ass now. Where are you? Oh! What the god damn? Goddamn fucking broke my goddamn camera. Shit. Come on. Don't do this. Please, come on baby. Goddammit. Come on. Please, please, please. Be there. Don't, come on, goddammit. Shit. It didn't work. Shit, goddammit. Did you get it? No, I'm just so damn frustrated. I need documented data before removal. Didn't you catch up with your cameras? No, all of the footage is corrupted. This has happened before, but you know, I customize the Faraday cages to protect the hardware from electromagnetic interference. The power of these things just supersede our understanding of physics. So what needs to be done? We need to capture proof and then we need to capture it. Fast. It could escape into another dimension at any moment. Maybe the security cameras... You can't view it with visible light. These are infrared cameras. It's different. People tell you that your house is haunted. That's because it's invisible to the human eye. Why not force it out wherever it's hiding? We could start by draining the pool. And cut off its water supply. Why are you here? Hello? Mrs. Lawson, come to the hospital now. Jessica's awake. Dr. Wakefield. She's, unbelievable. I can't hear you. Get here as soon as you can. Come to the hospital now. Walter, we need to go to the hospital. What happened? Dr. Wakefield called and said come now. I don't know, I couldn't hear. Okay, okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You gotta tell me where the, where the... James, we need to go. My daughter needs us. Okay, you guys go. Okay, I'll just stay here and work, but I need to know where the clean-out is for the house. It's behind the pool house. Mom, why are you crying? I'm just a little scared, babe. About the alien? Nope. About Jess. Let's just try to stay optimistic, okay. Yeah. You're right. This is Dr. Loizzo, the infectious disease specialists from the CDC. Where's my daughter? You'll see her shortly. She's right upstairs. All right, folks, long story short, she's out of the coma. She's made a full recovery. Oh, thank God. That's so great. Jessica has also been cured of her cystic fibrosis. Wait? How? It's just gone? Well, this is exactly our question. We have no idea. No one has ever been cured as cystic fibrosis. What are you looking at us for? Maybe you remember what she was doing that day, where she was. Did she eat anything unusual or is there mold in the house? I mean, anything could be the thing that unlocks us for us. I don't. There's an alien in our house. Sorry, what? Dr. Clay says it's IDB. Look, we just really want to see our daughter. Well, I'm sorry, who's Dr. Clay? Can we just see our daughter? Is that okay? Mom. Hi, dad. There you are. Don't hug me. Jess, how do you feel? This is, it's unbelievable. I've never felt better. I mean, they've been doing all these tests, but I already know how it happened. She healed me, the creature inside our home. I was afraid at first, but then she told me it wouldn't hurt. It speaks English? No monkey. You can feel it. You just know. We have someone there right now to get rid of it. What? No, you can't do that. You have to let her stay. I mean, our home's unlivable. What if it hurts one of us? No, you're not listening to me. She just needs a little time. I mean, she's not going to bother anyone. Time? Yeah, before she can go back. She's pregnant and she needs to give birth before she can go home. And she healed me. Kinda like a gift to say, thank you for letting her stay. Why is it so hard for you to believe me? I mean look, I'm healed. Why did she hurt the pool guy? She was protecting her child. She's scared. Turn this water off, that'll fix your ass. Dammit. James? Hey, it stopped me from draining the pool. I'm... Wait. Let's pause a moment. No, there's no time. There's no time. We need to talk. Talk? Yeah, we need to call this whole thing off. No, no, no. No, that's, that's wrong. There's so much you don't know. No, no, no. See, see, I am so close, look, look, I cut its water supply off and it needs to drink water. And when it drinks this, it is over. It's done. James, we don't want you to do that. But, but. There is no other way. James, we don't want you to take it. That's, that's a mistake. This is our home and we want it to stay. It's your home. But it's more story. This is my moment. We went to the hospital... The hospital. That's right. Look what it did to Jessica. You want that to happen to Timmy? No, but it cured Jess and it cure the incurable. Don't you see? It's a ruse. It's I told you it was cunning. Okay, we know how important this is to you, all right, so we're willing to pay you for your inconvenience. I'm too close. I'm not stopping now. Look, just, just, just, please. I need to pack your things now. Reconsider. Reconsider. It's important. My work is important. Leave. Timmy... Tommy! Okay, okay. Let me help you pack Okay. You leave me no choice. Help! Help! Help. Help. Help. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. Walter. Wake up. Don't do it! Don't, don't. I told you. I told you. I told you not to do this. You wouldn't listen. I'm just like you. I'm a mother too. Thank you. Are you there? Are you there? I'm gonna kill you! He's gonna kill my family. Ma'am, I understand. Famed scientist, Dr. James Clay, who was detained on attempted murder, assault and battery charges, made headline news and shocked the world by his nefarious paper. Many members of the scientific community are dismissing Dr. Clay as a man who would do anything for attention. He has been known for making false claims of having proof of alien life and various other assertions. That's right, Sarah. Furthermore, it's unclear why an astronomer and ufologist would terrorize a Florida family's home. The family was found safe, just with minor bruises and a little shaken up. Back to you, Tom.
