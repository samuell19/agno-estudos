That was just a peck. My first kiss will be with Jeong-ju. She's coming. It's all about expressions. Then it's the way you look. Never look her straight in the eye. She's bound to be interested. Oh Tae-hoon? Wipe your nose. Tae-hoon! Get on. All, all right. This is Na Jeong-ju. I will be your guide today. The first kiss for a girl holds special meaning. If she lets you kiss her, it means you are together now. So we will learn about kissing today. Also known as 'smooching' Love equals heart plus kiss. Love is touch! It's all about mood and timing to get closer physically. That's our main point today. Thank you. Jeong-ju, close your eyes. I'll kill you if you try to touch my breasts again! I won't... They're playing my favorite song! Get on! Doesn't your uncle resemble Christopher Reeve? Superman? Not quite. I was kissing your uncle in front of my house one day. You know, for the first time. When my dad caught us red-handed. He threw a boot at your uncle and his face swelled up like this. Grandpa probably didn't think he was good enough for you. My Jeong-ju will fall in love soon, right? I thought you practiced at school. It's more quiet here. More people, more noise. They're all coming to hear you sing. They're coming to see my face, not hear my song. I hate that. You'll catch cold if your hair gets wet. You don't want to me to get upset, do you? You want to go to Chuncheon with me tomorrow? 8 o'clock on the platform. Wear the helmet. Did you promise to go to Chuncheon with him tomorrow? It's not like I'm going to hell or something. I told you, he's a player. Don't call him a player. He IS. Hani is not like that. He said he doesn't like girls who like him for his looks. Would a player call himself a player? I told you not to call him a player! I'm telling you he's a player! One Two One Two? This is Hani, isn't it? You're strange. You seem like a different person. I like Hani. He said he likes me too. What about Tae-hoon? Tae-hoon is just a friend. What's wrong with you? Why Tae-hoon and not Hani? Because you can trust Tae-hoon. His feelings for you won't change. And he's a Gemini and an engineer. He'll be successful when he grows up. It's my life. Why should I let a guy run it? Hani is not the guy for you. He's going to ruin your life. He's going to dump you after he sleeps with you. Then you're going to regret it for the rest of your life. He won't. You don't know him. He will when you go to Chuncheon with him. No, no! How do YOU know? I know, I know everything! Why won't you listen to me? All right, I'll show you right now. What will happen when you go, And what you'll be doing at 30. You're just a seamstress, not a designer! Unexpected error occurred. What's this?! I hate you. Stop right there! Come back and watch this. This is YOUR life! The moment your wish comes true. Is the moment you return to the present. I'm going to count to three. I'm warning you. He's waiting for me. One. Two. Three! Uncle! Who is it? Go back to sleep. I was going to go. Did you wait long? I packed my bag and the helmet. But my cousin... Will you do it again? Don't do it again. I'm going to be on a talent show. Wow, really? Promise you'll be there. I'm going to sing for one person. An angel I love. Jo Hani! Who the hell are you? I'm Jeong-ju's boyfriend! What are you saying? Jeong-ju, step aside. He's a rascal. He flirts with girls. Then dumps them. Have you seen me do it? Shut up, you bastard. Please don't fight, please! Stay back, Jeong-ju. Are you hurt? Is your hand all right? What's wrong with you?! So what happened? It was an even fight. I liked her first. But she only looked at his hand... Tae-hoon. Hello, Ms. Lyricist Stop seeing Jeong-ju. I know you don't care for her. So before you hurt her. Stop seeing her. I like Jeong-ju. I'm sure you do. You like Jeong-ju the way you like Han Song-yi. And the way you like Young-ah. Am I wrong? Got you, didn't I? And those stupid girls think they're the only one. Where do you think you're going? I'm not finished yet. I'm warning you. If you see her one more time, I'm going to tell- Na Jeong-ju! I like Jeong-ju, not Young-ah. Then why did you do that to me? Bastard... Don't you play soccer anymore? No, my coach says no matter how hard I try, I will never make it because I have flat feet. That's okay. You should keep playing. I know a player who has flat feet. And he plays for Manchester United. Really? Really. So don't give up so soon. I shouldn't be giving advice... when I can't even control my own life. Come in. Isn't this great? What is this place? What do you think? Pretty good, huh? I'm going to be on the talent show. Which talent show? The one Jo Hani is going on. Jeong-ju is going to see him. I'll call out your name. Han Song-yi! So it had to come to this. Why do you like her? Why do I like her? I don't know. She's not too smart and she's grumpy all the time. And she doesn't smile at me much. She used to laugh a lot when I did this. Batman! By the way... When you get home, please fill up her pencil case. She's always losing one and looking for it all day. I used to put them in during recess. But she's too mad at me to see me right now. Are you really going to do the D.E.U.X. dance? I'm going to propose to her in front of everyone. What if she chooses Hani, in spite of all that? She won't. If Jo Hani can do Andy Lau, I can do D.E.U.X. All right, Let's do it. Leave Jo Hani to me. He's not going to be there. Why? It's none of your business. You just do your thing. Okay? Okay! Don't worry Alice. There's going to be a happy ending! How did I ever forget about you? You think your pencil case is full because you haven't lost any? Do you think he'll even notice you when you go there? Stop interfering, it's my life so I'm going to take care of it. It's not just your life. The thing I said about wanting to be like you... I take it back. You're despicable and materialistic. Just a hysterical old hag. The talent show you have all been anticipating is tomorrow night. Be there or be square! Seon-mi, I need you to kidnap Hani. I can't, I have a TV schedule. Do you know how much I get paid by the hour? Isn't that cheating? What are you talking about? Those who rule time rule the world. Whatever. I'm not going to bring you the next time. I started playing again. That's great. You said that if I tried hard enough, I'd make it even with flat feet. I'm going to play in the Premier League in 10 years' time. I'm coming! Pass, Ji-sung! Mr. Jo Hani? You're going to the talent show, right? Who are you? I'm a producer for MBC. I've come to give you a ride. You didn't have to but... Thanks. Microphone test, testing one, testing two. Welcome to the Youth Talent Show! Turn up the volume please. Would you like some gum? We're going in the wrong direction! What's going on? Why are we going this way? Where are we going? Chuncheon. What?! I'm just taking you to your favorite place! Turn around. Right now! Let me go right now! Here, Jeong-ju! What IS that? Isn't it pretty? Watch where you're going, old hag! Old hag? How dare you call me an old hag! I'm here to see Tae-hoon, not Jo Hani. Tae-hoon is on the show? If Jo Hani is, why not Tae-hoon? Just look at you. Thanks. Alice, what do you think? Do I look like an angel? Having wings doesn't make you an angel. Next up is Alsaewoo Band and Jo Hani from Sangrae High School. Alice, Hani is on next! Let's go! Let's skip to the next contestant. Ah, well, the order has been changed. A round of applause for the contestant no. 3 The Jaepyeong Boys! He's already broken his word. They said the order has been changed. Now, contestant no. 4 Ms. Kim Na-yeon will sing for us. Jeong-ju! How did you know I was here? I'm not supposed to show you now. Have you seen Hani? You should see me dance. I'm the last contestant. I'm going to go like this and this, then point at you... Have you seen him?! No. Jeong-ju. You look like an angel. Excuse me. Jeong-ju! What are you doing? Tae-hoon is up next. Jeong-ju! It's Tae-hoon. Come on, wave back at him. You can't go on. No can do. This is a live program! We have to finish right after the last contestant. Let us perform, please! I said no! I want you to put on Alsaewoo Band instead of me. You think you can just do what you feel like? What are you waiting for? Get up there! Competition is early coming to an end. With just one more contestant to perform! What are you going to do? Get up there, Jeong-ju is crying! Now the last contestant is Oh Tae-hoon from Sangrae High School. Change to Alsaewoo Band. What's going on? Ah... Well, we apologize. It seems there's been yet another change. The last contestant is Alsaewoo Band and Jo Hani! Please welcome them with a big round of applause. No... The moment I've been dreaming about Is here right now I offered you my heart And you accepted it The sun and the wind As bright as my spirit Is coming towards me I am feeling so much happiness The sky is open to us And you are standing next to me With a wide smile Yes you are the blue ocean What are you doing? It's your turn. It's okay, Alice. It's already started. No, stop him. He's going to call someone else's name... Hurry up! I would like to dedicate this song to my one and only... Na Jeong-ju! There is no more sadness We are so happy together under the sun Knowing we love each other The sky is open to us And you are standing next to me With a wide smile Isn't she pretty? Yes you are the blue ocean I love you, I love you I love you, I love you You'll be late. Let me hear it. We're not alone... Don't make me make you. Stay still... You're really late now. Why can't I hear it? Do you want anything? You're being silly... Come home early! You're expecting a baby? You saw us? I'm so embarrassed. Don't tell Jeong-ju yet. But you are sick. You're not going to keep it, are you? Everything's going to be fine. The thing is, Auntie, No, Mom... I'm Jeong-ju aged 30. I came back to change my life. You'll die giving birth to Young-woong. I know it's hard to believe but... Alice called yesterday. Did he grow up to be as pretty as you? How could I give him up, Jeong-ju? Even if you come back again... and ask me once more, My answer will be the same. Even if I die... there are things that cannot be changed no matter what. I wanted to change. My life and yours. But nothing changed. This was my last chance. Now I have to go back. It's time to go. I won't go to America, if you don't go to Chuncheon. I'm sorry Tae-hoon. Why are you going back? Wrong direction. She'll come back... She'll come back... Three two one... Where's Jeong-ju? Uh, Hani? I'll go get some drinks. All right. Hurry back. Jeong-ju! Jeong-ju! Jeong-ju! Alice, Alice! It wasn't him, it was my idea. Can't you just let us go? Yes, go, but don't regret your choice. The train bound for Chuncheon will leave at 0820. The passengers are asked to board the train immediately. Jeong-ju, wait... What's wrong? Alice, don't cry... I'll page you. Call me. Jeong-ju, don't forget to put on eye-cream when you turn 25. Take off your makeup before you go to bed. Don't eat anything after 7 p.m. Take care of yourself. And let me know how you're doing! Jeong-ju! Na Jeong-ju! You're a better person than what you think you are. Tae-hoon, you still like Jeong-ju, right? Of course, she's my first love. Even in ten years? I will never change. Alice, hold on. You'll fall off. Hold on tight. Alice? Alice! All of your wishes have been granted. The first question is, who is your first love, when and where? Alice, you were right. Hani dumped me. How could he do this to me? Young-ro? It's late but I'm going to start over. You said I had talent. When I meet you again. I will be a real designer. Seon-mi. You could have warned me before you came back! Alice, my mom... Hi. I think I must be adopted. Dad can't treat his real daughter like this. He's always going undercover. Yes, detective Kim. What? Big Head surfaced? Keep an eye on him. I'll be right there. Going undercover again? Big Head was spotted in Incheon. It's been more than 10 years. Wait just a bit longer. Good luck, Superman. Tae-hoon sent me a comic book from America. It's all in English. Isn't it hilarious? I'll call you again. Alice, I miss you. Yes, it's true. You were a comic freak. I used to get you those straight from the bookstore. What's the name of that thick one... 'Whisper Under Moon' 'Starlight Kiss' Tae-hoon. Am I really your first love? Yes. But you liked Hani back then. You still see him? No, he dumped me after that trip to Chuncheon. But I have no regrets. I really did love Hani then. Tae-hoon. Thank you so much. I'm going to America tomorrow. But I'll come back, in 5 or 10 years. Let me be your boyfriend then.
