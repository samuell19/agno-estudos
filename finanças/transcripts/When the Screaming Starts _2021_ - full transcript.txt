- Good evening. Tonight's main story, a series of brutal murders that have shocked the nation. - What started out as a civilized dinner party ended in a blood bath. - A historic and barbaric massacre. - 14 people dead in one of the bloodiest murders sprees this country has ever witnessed. - An act of shocking and disturbing evil. - Our thoughts tonight are with the innocent victims whose lives have been cut short. - Because when it comes to murder, someone always ends up getting killed. (upbeat rock music) (pan sizzles) - I'm Norman Graysmith, a two time award winning documentary filmmaker. I've achieved great success in unearthing groundbreaking stories in people living on the fringes of society. So when I stumbled upon Aidan Mendle in the dark recesses of the internet and learned this twisted dream, I knew I'd found the subject for my next story. Let's go make ourselves a documentary. (upbeat rock music) There are plenty of true crime documentaries focusing on serial killers, they're everywhere, but they're always reflecting on past events, whereas what I've uncovered with Aidan is unique, the chance to see a serial killer's legend unfolding right before our very eyes. (church bell chimes) It's not quite what I pictured when I thought about the home of an aspiring serial killer. Goes to show you can never really tell, you could be much closer to a serial killer than you realize. (man banging on window) Aidan Mendle? Aidan's been living in this house since his grandmother's sudden death, supposedly from natural causes. - My name is Aidan Mendle and I'm a serial killer, aspiring serial killer. "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil, tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name, Lenore. Quoth The Raven "Nevermore." This is my sacrificial knife, and this... retractable, go on stab me, stab me, go on stab me, go on stab me, stab me. Didn't even hurt. Doesn't live there. I like to pretend I'm a sniper sometimes. Most days, I just aim at Richard. - [Norman] Who's Richard? - Lives next door. Caught that bastard shitting in my garden one time. Look, look, look, there he is. There's Richard. Furry little twat. You know, black cats are supposed to be bad luck, of course that's a load of superstitious (gun shot) (Richard yowls) (Richard meows faintly) (upbeat music) I think about being a serial killer every day, at home, at work, it's constant. This is the cinema where I work. Perks of the job? Get to watch a load of films, horror films. (Aidan laughing) I basically run the place. It's great 'cause I get to do a lot of people watching, ya know, work out which ones I'd kill. Enjoy the film. It's on the left. Didn't like that job anyway, so their loss. Anyway, this gives me a chance to focus on my other goals, serial killing. Is your serial killer a woman? - Yes. Is your serial killer white? - Yes. My name is Claire and Aidan is my boyfriend. Our relationship is built on the mutual appreciation of murder. This is my scrapbook of the dead, I'm saving space in it for Aidan's victims. I met Aidan at a hit and run. Someone told me a little old lady got knocked down at the zebra crossing down the road. Naturally I grabbed my camera to take a few shots, (camera shutter clicking) were they my best work? No, but there was Aidan, basking in the subtle odour of fresh death. I like to use film. When you develop the images, you imprison their souls in the photograph, trapped in a silver halide crystal dungeon for all time. I usually like them fresh, but I take what I can get. - You've got to think the details through, like clothing, what you wear sends out a message. Too IRA? You don't want people thinking you're a terrorist when really you're a serial killer with no political affiliation. - Ted Bundy was a very sharp dresser, good-looking too. Aidan can at least dress well. (camera shutter clicks) (upbeat music) - That looks good. Simple, stripped back, you're making a statement. - Am I? Failure to prepare is preparing to fail. People say it's hard to murder someone, but they're wrong, murdering's easy, It's the planning that's hard. Your first victim should be personal, it's an important milestone for any serial killer. My first victim is someone I've known for a very long time. He betrayed me and killed our baby. Our band, Cannibal Death March. (death metal music) Luke was the vocalist, but the music, all me. ♪ Burn the witch ♪ ♪ Please don't burn me ♪ ♪ Burn the witch ♪ ♪ Please don't burn me. ♪ (guitar solo) ♪ Burn the witch ♪ ♪ Please don't burn me ♪ ♪ Burn the witch ♪ ♪ Please don't burn me ♪ - Don't screw this up. Be brilliant. You're going to go out, kill someone and then we can... - Watch a film. Yes Aidan, we'll watch a film when you get home, but remember if you kill... - I think we should watch The Shining. - Sex Aidan, if you kill someone, we can have sex. - Right. Yeah. Sex. (Radio tuning) - Where are we going? - Pub. - Which pub? - Slaughtered Lamb. - Were we meant to do a gig there once? - We certainly were. - Before I sold out. - Yes. - So what is with all the cameras? - Don't worry about them, they're just making a documentary. - A documentary? - Yeah. - What about? - Me. - You? - Yeah - Why? - Because I'm going to be a serial killer. - Okay. Who you going to kill Aidan? - You. - What are you doing? Is that chloroform!? - That's my research! - You're biting me! You bastard! Get off me! - Get your shoes off the seats. (tires squealing) - Norman, Norman, Norman. (Aidan choking) - Bastard! - This sort of thing can happen to any serial killer. When the Dusseldorf Ripper couldn't find a victim one night, he cut the head off a Swan, drank its blood. - Aidan, where are you going? - To find a swan! - Aidan, there aren't any swans around here! - Then I'll find a fucking pigeon! - Don't record me, go after him! - They were right about there not being any swans. It was a goose, they are surprisingly aggressive birds. - [Norman] The day had not gone according to plan, but there was a further twist in the tale. So you said you had something to tell me? - Well, we've been sitting on something for a little while now. Shall I tell him? - Tell him! - We're going to start a family. - Oh. Wow. Congratulations. May I ask how many weeks? - What do you mean? - Well, how far along are you with the pregnancy? - What pregnancy? - [Norman] Your pregnancy. - You're pregnant? - No! Who said I was pregnant? - You just said, "Going to start a family." - Yeah, like Charles Manson. - [Aidan] The idea of being the head of a family, a cult, that's always appealed to me. I'm a firm believer in the power of community. Hired this place out for the day, we want the prospective family members to understand that we're really serious about this. - [Norman] The interviews start with 42 year old Micky. - Hi. - [Aidan] Why don't you introduce yourself? - Hello, I'm Micky. - What do you do for work? - Well I'm sort of between jobs at the moment, I was working at the aquarium, but they had to let me go - after the incident. - Tell me Micky, why do you want to be part of our family? - Well, I suppose I've never really been part of any family before, so I thought this could be quite good. - [Claire] Why is that? - I was brought up in care. - I think we've heard everything we need to hear. - What about the other questions? - No more questions. - I liked Micky, but it's a jigsaw, all of the pieces need to fit together. - Orphans can't be trusted. - So Micky how'd you feel it went in there? - Yeah, I think it went well. I did my best, that's all you can ask. Just got to hope that Claire and Aidan like me, fingers crossed. So um, can I stay for a tea? - Sorry Micky, they're very busy in there actually. - All right. (somber music) - Hi, I'm Viktoria. - Hi, I'm Veronika. - Why do you want to be a part of the family? - Murder. - Drugs. - Sex. - Orgies. - When do the orgies start? - When do the orgies start? - We aren't the right fit for you, or you. I have a rare form of Dyophobia, the fear of pairs, doubles, identical twins are unnatural. - [Viktoria] Back home, we lived a very simple life. Our parents are... How do you say it? No drinking allowed. - No partying. - No boys - No drugs. What's the word? - [Norman] Traditional. - No, that's not it. - [Norman] Conservative? - No. - Assholes. - Yes! They're giant assholes. - I'll be in touch when we've made our decision. Just, quick question about the orgies. - She said no orgies. - No orgies. - Right, yeah, no, I was just wondering what the minimum number for an orgy would be? Three? Would three be an orgy? - Three is not an orgy. - It is a threesome. - Right, yeah. Makes sense. - Anyway. You're not our types. - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, I wasn't... - You have an off putting face. - And your body is pale and underdeveloped. - Right, yeah. Thanks. Why don't you introduce yourself? - Hi, I'm Donald. - Emily Granger. - My name's Jack Blingstone. - [Aidan] Hello? - Oh, my name is Patrick, Patrick Button. - I'm Imogen. - William. - What do you do for work? - Well, I work in a deli, don't I? - I'm retired. I'm currently a full-time man of leisure. - I'm a restaurant critic. - Well, I run a little B&B. Voted best breakfast in Tunbridge Wells, three years running. - I'm an influencer. (Imogen laughs) - Why are we defined by our work? Slaved to the whips of capitalism! If you must know, I'm a philosopher. - Who's your favorite serial killer? - Jimmy The Ripper, they don't make 'em like that anymore. - The Zodiac Killer. I'm Pisces, obviously. - Jeffrey Dahmer, the Milwaukee Cannibal. - Albert Fish. Yeah. You know I like the fish. - The Bubonic plague. - Oh, H.H. Holmes, oh without a doubt, yes. He had torture rooms built into his hotel. I myself, when my own B&B was being constructed had ideas of a rather similar nature. - You've got torture rooms in your B&B? - Sadly no, couldn't get planning permission. - Why do you want to join our family? - Since retiring I've done Tai Chi classes, French classes, (speaks French) and then I saw your ad for this and I thought "I've never joined a cult." So here I am. - [Patrick] What was your question? - What experience do you have? - Fish, chicken, cow. - I'm just kind of more into the aftermath. - What do you mean? - I have eaten every different cuisine all around the world, but the one thing I really want to try is...long pig. - Long pig? - Human. - Yum, just yum. (indistinct whispering) (heavy footsteps) - Take a seat, take a seat. (speaking Farsi) I here to learn. - Then you've come to the right place my friend. - So, how's it going today? - Yeah, it's going all right. It's just no one's really standing out yet. - Hmm. Hmm. - No one's really got that special... je ne sais quoi Donald taught me some French. - [Norman] Aidan and Claire are left with some hard decisions to make. - They don't work in a team, they work alone. - Hello? (intense organ music) Why don't you introduce yourself? - You don't look like a killer. You've never seen death. - That's where you're wrong, see... - You... You've seen death. (camera shutter clicks) Come in, come in. I've been living here ever since I was expelled from St. Hilda's school for girls. (children laughing) My housemistress informed my father of my...misdemeanors and he kicked me out of the family home as well. This is Ms. Danforth. Say hello Ms. Danforth! - Hello. - Ms. Danforth used to be my housemistress at St. Hilda's, didn't you? But then Ms. Danforth was very naughty and now she's in detention until she learns her lesson, isn't that right? - Yes. - And what lesson are you learning? - Snitches get stitches. - Well done! Very good Ms. Danforth! Okay, bye-bye. (knocking on door) Lights out. - [Norman] Aidan and Claire have now decided on the new members of their family. (indistinct chatter) - Biscuits! - Biscuits? - Yeah, biscuits. You don't speak English? (speaking Farsi) - You want a biscuit, do ya? - Have a biscuit? - No, no. - Go on mate, have a biscuit. (speaking Farsi) What? (indistinct chatter) - Family meeting! Family meeting! (mug clanging) Okay, couple of items on the agenda. Firstly, welcome to the family. Claire and I are really pleased to bring you into our house and share our dream with you. Secondly, you've probably already seen them, met them, but this is Norman and his crew. - Just ignore the cameras during interviews, just focus on me, just me. Thank you. - Just treat them as if they're part of the family. And lastly.... - [Claire] Yes Jack? - I just wondered if anyone wanted to share my biscuit? - Does anyone want to share Jack's biscuit? - Oh, there you go. - Thank you. - [Jack] Lovely. I learned how to cook at best school in London. - [Norman] Cordon Bleu? - You what? Nah, Wandsworth prison! Come on, let me show you around. - Geezer! - Tezza! Fucking wet down here, isn't it? - Ah mate. - [Jack] Come and get your one pound fish! You've got to try it to believe it. Come on, don't be shy! Mussels, prawns, langoustines and calamari. Come and get your fish. Fresh fish! You alright big fella? - [Tezza] Yeah, how about a taster? - What's that? - It's a fish and cheese infusion. - Nah mate, I'm alright. - Yeah but you just touched it. - [Jack] Get a taster from the Tezza! - Nah mate, I'm good, I'm good. Cheers mate. - Dickhead. Is the cheese supposed to sweat like this? - One kipper, lovely, two kipper. There you go. - Cheers. - Have a good day. - Thanks. - [Jack] Come and get your fish. Fresh out of the Thames. I got fresh tuna in a tin! Come and get it, come and get it. Liven up. - You got any cod? - Of course we have! How many do you want love? - Oh, two please! - Two cod please, Tezza? - Two! - Are you kiddin'? - That'll be six fifty please, love. You were saying, mate? - Okay so, a few of you have you have raised concerns that there might be a... racial element to this à la Charles Manson. I just want to put your minds at ease. Ours is a family of acceptance. (speaking Farsi) - Exactly Masoud. The point is we're all here to be serial killers and that should be an opportunity open to anyone regardless of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation. Ours is an organization... of inclusivity, okay? Yeah, now we're happy. - [Norman] Whilst it's a day of excitement for Aidan and Claire, not everyone shares the joy. Micky's application to join Aidan and Claire's family was unsuccessful. - Well I mean, obviously it was... Well it was disappointing. Ya know, I'd hope to be accepted into the family, but you know, I thought it went well. I mean, I'd wore my best shirt, deodorant, but... (somber music) it wasn't to be. Well, I suppose I'll just keep looking, see if there's a family that will accept me. Cake? It's the last one. - [Norman] Aidan's first task with this newly recruited family is to make sure of their proficiency in the art of murder. (whistle blows) - Welcome to the Mendle family bootcamp. This is weapons training 101. We're starting with a knife. Now it's retractable, but it can still hurt. Safety first. The first thing you need to do is surprise the victim, immobilize them, and then you can take your time, cut off an ear or something. My preference would be to cut the throat. Your turn. (whistle blows) - Good job. - Stop breathing! (whistle blows) - What? (Masoud gasping) - It was just practice. (speaking Farsi) It's not personal. - Masoud! (speaking Farsi) - Also good for my sciatica. (train rumbling) - [Norman] Aidan's brought the family to their new headquarters, where they will live together and plan their murders. - So we've got the living quarters over here. Getting a toastie maker and a kettle, set it up over there, that will be the kitchen. - [Norman] How are you paying for this, Aidan? - First month's covered. Inheritance. Thanks Nan. - Right, but after that first month? - Well, we'll kill people. - Yeah, no one's paying you for that. Right, no one's paying him? No, no one's paying you. - Power. (cheerful classical music) - Are you just going to sit there or? - I don't do flamingos. (speaking Farsi) - So the plan is for our family to find a home to attack. - Home invasion. - Just like the Manson family. Aidan's going to be the next Charles Manson. - Just not racist. - Stay out! (beep) (beep) - I can't wait to see the look on Claire's face when it's all over the news, us murdering an entire household. They might even have a dog. - [Norman] You want to kill a dog? - No, I just like dogs. - [Norman] Amy and Jack are scouting out properties to attack with the family later this evening. - Here we go, here we go. This is it. I got this address from Aidan. Some geezer applied to join the family, but didn't get in. He wanted to be a serial killer, so I guess we're doing the community a favor. - You might want to keep your distance. - Oh, why's that? - If the homeowners are in, they'll see you. - Nah, no one's home. - Are you sure? - Yeah, absolutely. - No one's home? - Nah look, you can tell. - How? - 'Cause an empty house gives off this kind of feeling, ya know? It has an energy. Yeah, this one... 100% empty. - Taxi, dear. - Oh shit. Shit. No, no. Shit. - Where are you going? (cursing in French) - We were never allowed a dog, mother's allergies, we had to have an outside pet. I had a pony, a cliche, I know. I killed it. - [Norman] You're not a fan of ponies then? - No, I love them. I hate cliches. Take the next left. I know a place. - Family meeting, family meeting. So tonight's the night, big night, we commit our first murders! - Does everyone have their instructions and understand them? - Yeah. - Yup. - Any questions? Yes, Amy? - Why aren't you coming with us tonight? - Well I'll be coordinating things from here. - Well I thought we were gonna kill them all together. - We are. - But you won't be doing any of the killing, we will. - No... see, if you shoot someone who does the killing? Is it the mindless bullet or the mind that pulled the trigger? (indistinct chatter) (speaking Farsi) - Thank you, Masoud. The mind. I ask the rest of you again, is it the mind or the bullet? (indistinct chatter) - It's the bullet! - See what you've done? You've made Masoud doubt himself. It's the mind Masoud. You are the bullets, but I'm the one pulling the trigger. - Are we done? - Yeah. (death metal music) - [Norman] How are you feeling about tonight? - We are excited. - We are very much looking forward to the slaughter. - The biggest difference between slicing a person and slicing a salami is that salami doesn't fight back, other than that, it's completely the same. (speaking Farsi) - I'm very excited to get lots of good shots tonight... of death. (camera shutter clicks) - How am I feeling? Would you like me to show you? - Come on, this normally works, come on, I've done this a hundred times. Amy it's not opening, I don't know what to do. - There is another way in. - [Jack] What? - Come on. (group laughing) - Hello Daddy. - Daddy? - What are you doing here? - We're here for the party! - Would your friends like to stay for dinner, darling? Jeremy pull up some chairs. - Get one of the help to do it, that's what we pay them for. - I'll do it. - Sit down. - What's on the menu tonight then? This is good. Which one of your esteemed guests are you trying to impress with this? - Are you finished? Have you had your fun? - Not quite. - Why did you stop playing? (gentle piano music) - [Mr. Kitson] I know what you're up to. - [Amy] Do you? - Yes I do, I know your game. Come in here and try and embarrass me. - Why on earth would I want to do a thing like that? - [Mrs. Kitson] It's a wonderful surprise, darling. - A surprise? - We didn't know you were coming to dinner. - Oh, that's not a surprise, mother. (Mr. Kitson screaming) This is a surprise. - You... fucking bitch. - Charles! - There you are, daddy! - I don't understand! - Of course you don't, when have you ever understood anything? - You don't scare me Amy. - No? - I'm not afraid of you. - You should be. - Should I call the police, father? - Do you want me to put you in the cupboard again, Jeremy? - [Mr. Kitson] You're going to regret this. All of you! You have no idea who I am. I'm going to crush you like ants, do you hear me? Like little fucking ants! (Mr. Kitson screaming) - Shall I tell you a little secret about my daddy? He has the big house and the fancy clothes, but really... he's just the son of a fish monger. - Lies! - I mean the piano, why'd you even have that monstrosity? No one in the family plays, so you've hired a pianist for every dinner party to impress the likes of George and Henrietta, and every other stuck-up parasite. (people screaming) Kill them all. - There you are. Where you hiding? Get up! (woman screaming) (speaking Farsi) (bottle smashing) - Come on then! You peasants! I'll take you all! Canapé - Amy! So good to see you. - Traffic was murder. - Amy no, no! - This is incredible. They're doing it, they're really doing it, people have actually been killed, this is unprecedented, this is...film making history. (upbeat music) - Drinks all around! - For Masoud. - You want some? Come on. You want some? Buzzin'! That was quality that. Oh this little baby of mine. Pulled together like a real team, we did. Quality that. All right, let's have ourselves a party. (upbeat music) (group cheering) - I'm happy. - I'm very happy. - I'm very, very happy. - Amy, Amy, Amy, I want... - Yeah! (speaking Farsi) - [All] Masoud, Masoud, Masoud, Masoud, Masoud! - What did it feel like when you killed them? - Like a Tuesday. - Amy was amazing tonight. A vision in the slaughter, drenched in blood, a goddess of death and destruction and she is beautiful. - Yeah. Amy's all right. - Amy, Amy, hi. Sorry. I just wanted to say I was really impressed with the way you handled tonight. Fantastic, really. And I hope this isn't overstepping the mark, but you look great on camera, seriously, serious, you look really, really great, and I've not quite worked out the right angle for this documentary yet so, Have I told you you look great on camera?. - Have I tooled you your breath smells of cheese balls? It's a shame I didn't get to kill Jeremy myself, but I've always wanted to be an only child, so can't complain. - Dolphin. Terry! This is my boy Terry everybody, AKA Tell Boy, Tezza! T-Pain, T-pack, Pacman, tea biscuit, tea towel, T-Rex, teriyaki. What else do we call ya? - Tea cake! - Tea cake! My boy Terry. Go and get in there, have some fun, mate. Come on, get in there and talk. - What should I call you? - Well you can call me anything you like, sweetheart. - T-bone it is. Oh god. - What's with all the blood, is it a fancy dress? - Put that in the bin. - We like your moves. - Old school. - I felt all warm blood go all over my face. - I'm proud of us, 'cause we've done it, we have done it, just together which is really good, I'm really... I hope you understand the contribution that you've made, it's not as much as me but it's still significant, and I want you to be happy with what we've done.... Together, 'cause that's really what it's all about together, is just... together, ya know? Everyone, everyone, eyes to me, eyes to me for a minute, everyone, everyone, everyone, this is a celebration. - Hoorah! - Hadn't actually finished Masoud, so... Tonight was the beginning of my serial killer career, and that wouldn't have been possible without each and every one of you. Amy, I hear you took a lead in the house tonight, so thank you for being my right hand, of course, when your right hand does something you don't thank your right hand, you thank your brain for controlling the hand because your right hand is essentially an uncomprehending tool, controlled by the brain. So I want you all to raise your glasses to the brain who controlled you all tonight and basically did everything, which is me. So, to me. - [All] To Aidan. - Yeah. - Turn the music back on. (funky music) (birds chirping) - I've got it. This has got to be a world first, everything's here, the blood, the death, I mean the focus was... but this! This is groundbreaking stuff. This is going to put me on the map. (computer mouse clicks) (woman screaming) - Oh, hi Amy. Have you seen Terry? - Haven't seen him. - Huh? Right. Tea biscuit? - Fresh... new day. - This is the sort of thing they'll have in a museum when there's an exhibition about me. - If Aidan was the true head of this family than he would have been there last night. He's just another Charles Manson looking for headlines while we do the hard work. - Right, now remember this is a first draft. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Dear boss... What the fuck is this? - It was just a missive to the police about my crimes. - Your crimes? - The horrors of last night. - You have no right to talk about last night. - You lost that right when you decided to stay here, instead of standing with us. - But I was there. - You were here while we cut their throats and bled them dry. - No, I was there. I mean Jack, come on, was I there? - Nah, mate. - Twins, come on, tell her, tell her, tell her I was there. - We cannot lie. - You were not with us. - Wherever my family are, I am there also. - Not physically. - Spiritually! - Spiritually? - Spiritually? What's he on about, spiritually? (indistinct chatter) (speaking Farsi) - Not you as well, Masoud. - You didn't kill those people. - Yes I did. - You're not a serial killer. - I bloody am. - You're not, you haven't killed anyone. - Well I killed Richard. - Who's Richard? - Richard's a cat. - And I shot him. - Accidentally. - I still shot him, didn't I? The person who shot Richard is me. I shot Richard and I killed those people. - Aidan you fought a goose and you lost. - It was extremely aggressive. Look, those murders are mine, okay? So I didn't bloody my hands but I bloodied my brain, this brain that thought up the whole plan. Without me, none of those people would have been killed last night, because none of you, my children, would have been there to kill them because you wouldn't have been my children, you would have just been regular people, going around doing regular things. Those murders are my murders! So if you don't like the way I do things, you can just leave, okay? They'll be back, they'll be back. Spoilt brats. - What was that? - Oh no, just all the best. - Aidan? - Yeah? - It is time. - Just give me a minute, okay? - We should do it now. - Right now? Where'd you want to do it? I could get one of the sleeping bags and we could... - Sweet Adian, you're not the person I thought you were. - What do you mean? - I'm going. - But I thought we were gonna have some... - Nevermore. - You win some, you lose some Adrian. (speaking Farsi) - Oi! Get out of the road you fucking mug. - Where are ya Tezza, where are ya? Answer me back, mate. I'll wait down here for you Amy, yeah? I think Amy done something to Tezza last night, I ain't waiting for her to slice up my salami, no way. - My family left me, Claire's left me, At least I still have you guys. - Sorry Aidan, I just can't keep you as the subject of this documentary any longer. - Please Norman, no you can't do this to me. - Are you crying? - See, this is what I mean, you're weak and I can't waste any more time with you. I'm going to finish this documentary with a real serial killer. - You're not coming. - What? - I'm in charge now. We're going to keep a low profile. - But what about the film? - There will be no film. - There will be no film. - Where's the footage from last night? We're taking it. - Please Amy, please don't... - Don't make me ask again. We're done here. - Amy please! Where are you going? - Home. - Why? - Why not? - My dream... No your dream, our dream, the film! - What film? I didn't even kill anyone. - Fuck! Turn that off! Turn that fucking camera off. Fuck! Fuck! - Me and Claire, plenty more fish in the sea, I was thinking of ending things with her anyway so. (Aidan sobbing) Do I miss the family? No. All the best to them! I wish them nothing but the best, if anything, this is an opportunity to start from scratch, blank slate, only the best this time. - Only the best. Poor Aidan, he's really been hurting, but on the upside, he's really taken to the biscuits. I always say there's nothing much you can't cure with a bourbon, apart from loneliness. I used to imagine having a mum and she'd be going, "Stop eating all the biscuits, Micky! You're going to grow up fat!" She'd have been right. But it's alright 'cause she didn't exist. I better go and check on Aidan. (fox barks) - I need to get that footage back, the world needs to see this. (owl hoots) Come on. (dog barking) Heavy duty. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Looks like my luck's changing. (intense music) Upstairs, upstairs. It's okay. Come on, let's go, let's go. Back door, back door! - Hello, Norman. So nice of you to drop by. - I just came for my footage. - I can see the headlines now! "Failed amateur journalist becomes the victim in his own twisted serial killer documentary." Now there's a story. Did you really think you could watch murder after murder without getting yourself a little bloody? - Okay... all right you can have the footage. Just let me go home... please. - You know, I thought about letting you go, but how could I live with myself? Knowing you were running around, making such tasteless films. It's not your fault Norman, some people just don't have an eye for it. (Amy gasping) - Amy? (camera shutter clicks) I can explain, Claire, just let me explain. (camera shutter clicks) It was an accident, alright? It was an accident! Claire? (camera shutter clicks) Just give me the camera, Claire. - I always knew you would be the one. - Claire, just give me the camera. Claire, give me the camera. Just give the camera, Claire! - You did it beautifully, Norman. (dog barking) (intense newsmusic) - Two women have been killed after being stabbed in a vicious and monstrous home invasion. The police are looking at the possibility that this attack is somehow linked to the brutal murder of the Kitson family earlier this week, (Aidan screaming) This senseless act of violence is the latest in a series of horrific crimes that have shocked the nation. The murder investigation is underway and whilst the victims remain unidentified at this point, their deaths will be sadly mourned and their loss deeply felt. (phone ringing) - [Norman] Aidan, it's me, Norman. I need to see you. - Looks like you're gonna get to see me kill someone after all. Wait here, Micky. - Nah, I'm coming with you. - No, you need to wait here and if I'm not out in 10, you know what to do. - What was it again? - Police Micky, call the police. - Okay. - Aidan. Come. Come. Come. Aidan, thank you so much for coming. How was the journey? - It was fine. - Good. That's good. My condolences for Claire. I want you to know I never intended for that to happen, but there is a silver lining here, Aidan. Congratulations! - Congratulations? - Your first kill! Well, kills actually. Congratulations for killing Claire and Amy. - That was you. - No, they're yours. Think of it like a present. - No. - Yes. Don't you see how perfect this is? You need some kills, but you don't have any. I have two, and I don't want them. I bequeath them to you. - I can't. - You can, you have to. All you have to do is say on camera "I did it. I killed Claire and Amy." Then we send the footage to the police and you'll be a serial killer. - No. - All right Aidan, it's a double homicide, if we're going to get it all technical, but you'll still be a murderer all the same. Just let me help you, please. Let me help you, Aidan. Let me help you. What are you going to do with that? You're gonna kill me, is that it? Killer. Well go on then, do it. It's what you've always dreamed of, isn't it? So kill me, kill me. Go on Aidan, do it Aidan. You can do it. Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it! - No! I don't want it, I don't want any of it. - It's okay, it's okay Aidan. (Norman and Aidan grunting) (Aidan struggling) - Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh fuck. (blood squelching) (Aidan screaming) - First thing you've got to do is surprise your victim. (Aidan choking) Then... you have to immobilize them. What was it you said you'd do next? Oh yeah... cut the throat. (distant yelling) - [Aidan] Why am I doing this? I don't want to go through life being a nobody. I want to be remembered. My name is going to go down in history. Serial killers don't get forgotten, no one remembers the victim. (intense rock music) - I'm stood outside the building where police last night arrested Norman Graysmith, Graysmith who has been linked with the deaths of up to 14 people and is also believed to have orchestrated the Kitson family massacre. Police unfortunately arrived too late on the scene to prevent Graysmith from claiming one more victim, an unnamed man in his twenties, just another casualty in the Camper Van Killer's deadly tally. (upbeat rock music) (wind whistling) - When we heard what Norman did to Amy, we thought it might be time to go home. - Our parents wanted to know what we've been up to, but we couldn't really tell them. - We were going to make up some story about traveling around Europe. - Studying. - Sight seeing. - Working. - But then we thought it might be easier to just... - Butcher them! - Yeah! So that's what we did. (twins laughing) - Look at your face! - Fuck them. - Yeah. (speaking Farsi) - What are you telling them, pookums? (speaking foreign language) What's he saying? Good things I hope. (laughs annoyingly) Masoud, what are you saying? - You heard it here first and you'll never hear it again, Urban sushi, ladies and gentlemen, come and try it. Well, I'm on the run now, aren't I? I've got to stay one step ahead of the Feds. I go by Dave now. Dave's deli! Come and get your fish. Fresh out of the Thames. Hiding in plain sight. - Same as usual, brother. - Lovely. - Listen, top man, Jack man, look after yourself, yeah? - It's not Jack, it's Dave. Muppet. You alright, officers? - Hi Dave. - Usual today is it? - Yeah, cheers Dave. - Two seafood buns coming right up. - You know your beards coming off? (upbeat rock music)
