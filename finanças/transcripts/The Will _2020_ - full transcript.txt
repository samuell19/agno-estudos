For as much as it hath pleased. Almighty God of His great mercy to take onto Himself the soul... of our dear sister here departed. We therefore commit her body to the ground... earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life... through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to Himself. Rest in peace. - Amber, get in the car. - I am not getting in the car! Amber, do you have to do this today? - No, I'm not getting in! No! - Get in the car, please. - Amber, get in the car. - Whatever. Henry Gangon's studio. - Ah, yeah. - Henry, it's Josephine. Okay. One second, one second. One more. Jesus Christ! Okay, hang on. Josephine. Hey, Josephine. Hi, Henry. Yeah, I should've come with you. I'm alright. Uh, I... I'll meet you in Paris. I just have to go to the reading of the will tomorrow and, um, take care of things here once I know what's what. Look, if this takes more than a week, I'm comin' up there, okay? You've been looking after me for 23 years you're more than an assistant, you're my best friend. That's very kind. - Josephine, I do have to go. - Okay. I will call you tomorrow, okay? Josephine Malone. Terry Baginski. I'm stepping in for Arnie today. Mr. Spear is late, which isn't a surprise. Who is Mr. Spear? He's the other person mentioned in your grandmother's will. Mr. Spear has arrived. - Terry? - Oh... I'm sorry. A-are you alright? My apologies. Yes. - You're Josie. - Josephine. Malone. Uh... Lydia's, uh, granddaughter. I know. "I, Lydia Josephine Malone, "being of very sound mind "and knowingly questionable body "do hereby bequeath all my worldly possessions "to my granddaughter, Josephine Diana Malone. "This includes Lavender House and my investment portfolio. "I bequeath everything to Josephine but $150,000. "This will be provided to Mr. James Marcum Spear "in order that he put it in a trust. "Fifty thousand each for Connor Marcum Spear, "Amber Jolan Spear and Ethan James Spear. "And last, my most prized possession, "the thing I treasure above anything else in this world, "my granddaughter, Josephine Diana Malone, I hereby bequeath to James Marcum Spear." - What? - What? "Jake, Josie is quite awkward and I don't mean simply "that she is a complete klutz. "She doesn't know how to enjoy herself. "But if you find your way to coax it out of her, "she gives off the sweetest light "that will ever shine on you. "I'm trusting you, my Jake, to take good care of her. "These are my wishes and I will them to be done. "If they're not, I'll know "and it'll make me very upset "I know neither of you want that. Now, be blissfully happy, my Josie and my Jake." Did Lydie just leave me you in her will? Obviously, the bequeathal of a human being isn't binding. Copies of Mrs. Malone's official last will and testament. There's also contact information for Stone Incorporated. They're interested in purchasing Lavender House. Although gran didn't mention you, it's clear she held you and your children in very high regard. So, it was a pleasure to meet you. Goodbye. Wait. Hey, hey, hang on. Josie, wait... - Mr. Spear, not to be rude... - Jake. My name's Jake. Look, something big just happened in here. Indeed, and if you're concerned, I'll take issue with the gifts my grandmother bestowed on your children. - Please don't be. - No, it's not what I'm saying. I'm talkin' about the other gift, Josie. Nobody calls me Josie. Lydie did. Tonight, we need to have dinner. I'm afraid dinner is out of the question. I see that you're trying to pretend like that didn't just happen, but it did happen. I mean, the least we could do is get to know each other, right? Don't we owe her that respect? I mean, look, if I'm a dick, then that's it. But I'm not gonna be a dick to Lydie's girl, because that woman meant a lot to me, and to my kids. When and where? Lobster Market, 6:30. I'll see you there. It's nice to finally meet you, Josie. Uh, Josephine. May I join you? I wouldn't mind, but there's a man in my life who would. Well, if I were that man, I would hate for you to dine alone. Well, he's busy this evening and I had a craving for lobster bisque, so... If you had a craving for anything, I would make sure you got it. Actually, Jake knows I'm quite capable of getting what I want on my own. Jake? Jake Spear. What, you used to dance for him? What? Class piece. Looks like Jake's finally learned to trade up. I beg your pardon? If you're lookin' to be the fourth Mrs. Jake Spear, let me just tell you, he might make a fortune from that strip club, but the Truck goes through women like water. What the hell? You know, it's been a long time since someone stood me up. If you had any idea what it took to get Amber to babysit her brother last night. How did you get in here? I have keys. All the kids have keys. Ethan comes here after school. Well, I will have to ask for those to be returned. Seriously? Did my grandmother know you own a strip club? Yeah, she did. Seeing as she lent me the money to buy it. So your business is to objectify women? I see. So I'm an asshole? Alright. I didn't know that. Seeing as my least talented girl makes at least 500 a night, on a slow night. I might be just a teensy bit judgmental if she told me she was loaning a man money to buy a strip club. A man who's been married three times. Oh! Okay. You've been askin' around about me. Lydie told me you were classy, didn't tell me you were judgmental. You don't know me. I might know you better than you think. Hm... Why didn't you tell me about him, gran? Excuse me, I'm Boston Stone. CEO of Stone Incorporated. I don't wanna bother you, except to ask if you'd like to have lunch with me to discuss your plans for the Lavender House. Um, my grandmother passed away five days ago, and, um... There are a lot of things on my mind, but not one of them is discussing my plans for Lavender House. Of course. I'm sorry for your loss. If you change your mind... Hm... - What'll it be? - A club soda. And can someone tell Mr. Spear that I'm here to see him? Mr. Spear is unavailable. Can I give him a message? No, but thank you. Mr. Spear... Uh, Jake... This is Josephine Malone calling. Uh, I just wanted the opportunity to apologize, and also, I just wanted the chance to talk to you about... other things. Dammit! - Hello. - Hello. I gotta tell you, you really classed up the joint seeing you in there. - Oh, you saw me? - Yeah, of course I did. We got cameras everywhere just in case some drunk asshole gets out of line, gotta take care of him. You, uh... Somethin' you wanna say to me? I-I don't know if you have consultants for this kinda thing, but the brunette is gorgeous. Uh, with her skin tone, a deeper auburn will suit her much better she'd make a fabulous redhead. And the blonde, she's so cute, she just needs a manicure and a keratin treatment. Okay. Ha-ha-ha! Oh, yeah. Lydie was right. Adorable. - Sorry? - Uh, nothin'. Um... Is that, is that the message you had for me? I'd like for you to come to dinner at Lavender House tomorrow night. Um... Gran clearly wanted us to get to know each other and we should do that. Yeah. I'm just not sure how she wanted us to get to know each other. Look, don't worry about it, alright? You're not my type. I mean, I don't think I was your type either. I-I don't understand what gran wanted for you and me. I don't know, but, I mean, maybe she... wanted you to know you had a friend and still had at least one person who cared. Well, that makes no sense. She knew I had Henry. Yeah, I don't care what excuses you make for that guy. He should've been with you at your grandmother's funeral. Instead of letting you stand there crying behind your shades alone. Well, you promise you're not gonna ghost on me tomorrow, and I'll show, but, uh, I gotta tell you I gotta bring Ethan with me. Alright, then. Goodnight, Jake. Goodnight, Josephine. Hey, y-you can call me Josie. Goodnight, Josie. Um... - Hello. - Hey. So, Amber got herself grounded two seconds before we left the house, so if you don't have enough food, I can order a pizza. - Or something. - Oh, no, I have enough food. Hi, Amber, it's a pleasure to meet you. Whatever. - Hello, Ethan. - Hi. - Josie. - Come on in. Okay. - It smells boss. - Mm. Ooh. Yeah, it does. It smells like meat. I'm a vegetarian. Ah, right. She decided that this morning. Killing animals for food is disgusting. How about killin' daughters for bein' a pain in my ass? Crap! What is that? It's pavlova. We're having it for dessert. I don't eat dessert. My ass is already fat enough. Get me a beer, will ya, bud? Um, everything is done. I wasn't sure if he needed to get home early to do homework... No, no. The, uh, homework's in the truck. Alright. Dinner's ready. Rosemary meatloaf with romesco sauce. Oh! - Don't you like meatloaf? - No. Yeah. No, I do. I thought we were gonna have to choke down coq au vin or something. Do you want some, Amber? I heard being vegetarian is a good way to lose weight. I don't know why you'd be worried about that. You have a perfect body. I don't know if my grandmother told you, but I work in fashion. I hope you don't mind my saying, but you're exceptionally pretty. Go a little less heavy on the make-up. Jean Michel Duchamp taught me how to do make-up. I have both of his books. My boss Henry shot the one with the models. Oh, my God! How did I not know that? Lydie told me that you worked for Henry Gangon, I should've known that. If you want, I could take your picture and ask him to share some pointers. Are you freaking serious? Oh, my freaking God. Dad, you have to lift the ban on my cell phone so I can tell Taylor and Taylor about this. - Who's Taylor and Taylor? - Her best friends. Yeah, you can tell them tomorrow. - Please, dad. - Mm-hm. The easiest way to get what you want is by listening to your father. Yeah, listen to your father when he's totally unreasonable about Noah. - Who's Noah? - My boyfriend. He wants to take me to a concert and dad refuses to let me go. She used the F-word like a bazillion times. Well, you're a beautiful girl and Noah could be a paragon of virtue. But if your dad loves you, it's his job to be cautious. If he didn't care, that's when you should be upset. That's what Lydie would say. - To Lydie! - Hey, to Lydie. To Lydie. Well, dinner was great, huh? Oh, I'm glad you liked it. Boston Stone came by. He what? He's interested in buying Lavender House. Yeah, but Lydie told him to go jump in the Atlantic. And what did you say to Stone? I told him I wasn't prepared to discuss it. Are you gonna get prepared? Nope. So you're keeping Lavender House? Lydie said the only person who loves Lavender House more than her is Josie, and that she'd never let it out of the family. The only person who loves Lavender House more than gran is me, and I'd never let it out of the family, so... Yeah, I'm-I'm keeping the house. Yes! Hey, you go pour yourself some wine, I got this. - It was lovely to meet you. - Same. The food was freaking awesome! - It was a good night. - Thanks. Thank you. Um... Tell you what, tomorrow, 9 a.m., meet me at The Shack. - The Shack? - Yeah, The Shack, slick. Best seafood omelets in town. They're gonna knock you on your ass. Uh, 9 o'clock at The Shack. - Alright, later. - Later. "He came up to me. Andy Collen sat with me all lunch. "And he said he'd see me tomorrow. "My man is gonna be strong, and handsome "and smart and fierce. "And he's gonna move to Maine and live at Lavender House." "I'm fine with being alone. "The truth is, how my father treated me, how he beat me, "it affected me. "If I were to have a man, he would need to be "very gentle and understanding. "Patient and kind, maybe dashing and refined. Most of all, successful, because I like being alone." Give me a holler when they're done, Tom. - Good morning. - Good morning, slick. Tom doesn't mess around when it comes to coffee. So it seems. - I like your kids. - Yeah, they liked you too. Even Amber? Even Amber, yes. Let's see, well, Amber likes boys, make-up, shoes, clothes, and boys bears repeating. Um, she hates schoolwork, her dad, her mom, uh, helping me out around the house and pumping her own gas. Well, isn't it normal for a girl her age not to like those things? Yeah, I guess so. Uh... She hates me because, well, I'm exactly what you said I am. I'm a protective dad and, yeah, I'm strict about her getting good grades 'cause my girl is smart as hell. Uh, she hates her mom 'cause her mom is all about getting laid. Younger the guy, the better. - Is she Ethan's... - No. Okay, uh, Amber and Connor have the same mom. I married someone else in between. That lasted three months. Ethan has a different mom. That lasted three years. Yo, Jake! Food's up! There we go. Dig into that. So, how did you get to know gran so well? Oh, well, it's a... It's a whole story. I... You know what, I owe you dinner. I'll take you out. I'll tell you the whole thing. Sounds doable. Henry. - Henry. - Josephine. Hey, you haven't called in two days. Sorry, Henry. I-I'm just having breakfast with Jake. - Jake? - Yeah, a friend of gran's. - Uh, who is Jake? - He owns a strip club in town. Your gran was friends with this guy? I-it's a long story, Henry. I'm sorry. I-I don't have time to tell you right now. Okay, well, listen, I'm meeting you in Paris? It seems like that's unlikely. Okay, then I'm cancelling that. I'm gonna come straight to Maine. Can we discuss this later? Okay, I'll see ya. Go talk to Jake then. Alright, buddy, let's roll. Sound like it went well. He says he's cancelling work to come to Magdalene. Good, 'cause it's good to have your people around you. Well, it makes no sense. There's a video shoot. There's a lot of money tied up in it. You're worth bailing on all that. I-it's foolish. You're worth being that, too. So, while I'm in Magdalene I can help out. If you need someone to take Ethan after school, I'd be happy to help. That's good of you. The kids really loved Lydie, you know. And part of the reason Amber's such a pain in the butt these days is that she doesn't know what to do with all that hurt now that Lydie's gone. - You're done? - Mm. Alright. I'm taking you out to dinner tomorrow night. Wear something nice. Mr. Stone. I'm not here to talk about Lavender House. I'm here to ask you out to dinner tomorrow night. I'm sorry. I have plans this weekend. Monday night then. Uh, I-I'm not looking for romantic attachments. How about drinks, Monday night at the club, 7 o'clock? Fine. Monday night, 7 o'clock. See you there. - Great. - Okay. Josephine. So sorry I couldn't talk before. I know you're busy. Don't worry, I got a new guy filling in for you. But, uh, he doesn't know me like you do. I'm just not sure I'm ready to go back to work yet, Henry. Sweetheart, of course, you're not. So I was thinkin', you and I, we need a break. We're gonna do it at Lavender House. Okay, but there's one little glitch. Sweetheart, I can't get out of Paris. I'll be alright. Yeah, I know you will, sweetheart. But listen, tell me about Jake. Who's Jake? Oh, Jake and his kids were really close to gran and they're missing her a lot. It's... It's so sweet. Well, I'm really glad you have them there, honey. That's great. Um, listen, you'll have me there too. Just as soon as I can. Oh, Amond's calling. He's on tour somewhere. - I've gotta take it. Okay. - Call me back when you can. Amond. You lost your grandmother, you didn't even call me? - Hi! - Josephine, you're my girl. And even though you decide to not officially be my girl, you still are. I'm fine. I-it's lovely that you care. Josephine, whenever I'm on that red carpet, any girl that I have on my arm, she's not you. You need me, I'm there. You hear me? I hear you. Thanks for calling, Amond. It was good talking to you. I'll talk to you later. One, two, three. Weave! One, one, two, three. Weave! Nice. One, one, two, three. Weave. Good. One, one, two, three. Weave. One, one, two, three. Weave. Get down. One, one, two, three. Weave. Nice. One, one, two, three. Yes! One, one, two, three. Yeah. Betty, take over. - Hey. Is everything alright? - Hey. Gran's clothes, there's no reason to keep them. Uh, I'm... Maybe s-somebody could use them. Uh, I just want it to be a den again. I just... - Maybe you... - Hey, I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it. I'll take care of the clothes. I'll take care of the den. Thank you. - I'll let you go. - No, no. Hey. Well... Yeah, I gotta work, but you want me to swing by later tonight? No, I-I'm okay. That's-that's very kind of you. But, uh, really, I'm okay. Well, listen, you have any other worries, I'm just a phone call away. Yes. - So, I'll see you tomorrow? - I'll see you tomorrow. - Hello. - Hello. - I'll just get my coat. - Alright. - Hey, uh, let me get that. - Oh... - Where are we going? - To Eve's. - Ooh, that's expensive. - Well, you're you. And you're wearing that dress, so where else would I take you? Well, you took me to The Shack yesterday. And wasn't it the best seafood omelet in town? What are the kids doing tonight? Uh, well, Amber's grounded. Uh, Ethan's probably eating junk food and Connor's got one of his girls coming over. - Oh, one of his girls. - Oh, yeah. He's got five. Well, that doesn't bode well for the future. Women don't like to share. Well, if a man's any kind of a man the first time he hurts a woman, he doesn't do that again. And how did that lead you to getting married three times? Look, I got nothing to hide. I did what I did. I made some mistakes, but, uh, you know, I'm still standing. My kids are happy and healthy. So, your wives... Alright, let's do it. Um... Donna's the first one. My first love. Loved her. She wanted divorce. I gave it to her. Uh, then it was Mandy, second one. Loved her. She couldn't hack the kids. - And the last one? - Sloan, Ethan's mom. Uh, you're down with real? I'm down with real. - Uh, she was fantastic in bed. - That's it? No. No, no, no. She was incredibly fantastic in bed. It sounds like you didn't wanna end things with any of these women. Well, you open your eyes, you see the signs. Well, you followed your heart. And I think that's very brave. I've never been here without gran. I know she'd be happy we're doing this together. And you look great in your suit. - Thanks for inviting me. - No. Uh... The pleasure's all mine. Believe me. From the man at the bar. Does he honestly think that will impress me? Excuse me a second, would you? Outside. Oh, you have got some stones on you, huh? - It's a pun, right? - No, no, it's a compliment. You send a drink to a woman sitting across from me. I mean, you've got more balls than brains. I'm pretty sure the Dom Perignon would've been wasted on you. Now, you listen to me. Josie's got way too much class for you. So I hate to be the one to break it to you, but it's, it's just never gonna happen. We'll see what happens Monday night between me and Josie. We both know that Josie Malone is hot. My suggestion to you, get in there and do it before your little charm wears off. - Ooh! - Josephine. I guess I won't be having a drink with you Monday night. It's really unfortunate that you had to hear... No, no. It's not unfortunate at all. I thought you were just shallow and insensitive. But it turns out, there's much more to you, and none of it is good. This is the first nice evening I've had since my grandmother died. I'm not gonna let you ruin it. Come on, Jake. Let's go inside. I'm desperate for a martini. - Wow! - No wonder gran liked you. Can I ask that we just sally forth and enjoy the evening? We can sally forth anywhere you want, slick. Just don't hit me. Oh, gran and I used to sit up here all the time. Yeah? So, tell me how you two met. Well, there's a local news reporter who's a friend of mine. And, uh, when it looked like the gym was gonna close, she made a big deal about it. "Truck! Truck, they're gonna close the gym. And the kids are gonna lose their league." Lose their league? Yeah, I have a junior boxing league I run out of the gym. What is the Truck? I'm the Truck. Used to box. Oh, you're a pugilist. Used to be, a pretty good one. Uh... Had a few pretty decent fights, you know. Made some good money. But, uh, you know, body can't take that forever, not to mention the head. So, I got out. I came back to Maine. And I used the winnings to open the gym. And why do they call you the Truck? Mm... I was fighting some college kid. Two minutes into the first round, I gave him a left hook, dropped him. They asked him what happened after the fight, said he thought he got hit by a Mack Truck. So, Truck. I'm guessing that's complimentary. I-I took it that way. Yeah. So, you were about to lose your gym. Yeah, and then Lydie offered to help bail me out. I was working two jobs at the time. I was... I had the gym and I was a bouncer down at The Circus. It was a dump back then. But I knew that if I could buy it, I could turn that place around. So, Lydie suggested if I put my gym up as collateral she would loan me the rest of the money. - Obviously, I said no. - You said no? Yeah, I'm not taking money from an 86-year-old lady. - But eventually you did. - Well, she met the kids. And she got involved in our lives. She kept us and we kept her. And, uh, yeah, eventually, she wore me down. And so, I bought The Circus, I closed it down. I fixed it up. I paid her back within a year. And, uh, life changed. I think it's great that she helped you. I just don't understand how she could be so involved in your lives and yet, she never introduced any of you to me. Well, she talked about you all the time. My best guess is that once she has you, she didn't wanna share you. In seven years? Look, I got no answers for you. I hate that she's gone, but... we got each other now. We have each other now. Another good night. Yep. No, no, no. Don't get up. Alright. Sleep tight. - You too. - Don't forget to lock up. Goodnight! - Hey, dad. - Hey. How was dinner? Um... Josie is amazing. You into her? What are you grillin' me for? You got a girl in there watching television. 'Cause Ethan says she's mega pretty. Well, she is that. Just see for yourself. Hey, Connor. Pick one. A woman's heart is fragile and precious. Don't be that asshole kickin' it around. What's shakin', slick? I'm not sure how to answer that since nothing's shaking, Jake. Okay. I think that's it. You wanna see? There you go. Oh... Wow. Thank you. - I don't know how to... - No, no, please. I think we established you don't have to say anything. Would you like to stay for a beer or something? I'd love to, but it's Football Sunday. I got rotel dip to make, family favorite. Rotel dip? You don't know what rotel dip is? Come on, you take a can of rotel, you dump it on a block of cheese, you nuke it, you serve it with corn chips. It's my specialty. You should come over next Sunday. Try it. I'd like that. Alright, well... Hi, would you guys like to come over for dinner? Sure. Yeah, we'd love to. - Hi! - Hello. - And son number one, Connor. - Hi. Hi. Connor, I've heard so much about you. It's a pleasure to meet you. - Seriously? - Yeah, I'm serious. And I've heard a lot about you from Lydie. - Hi, Amber. - Hello. Hey, if you promise not to mumble tonight, I'll show you what Jean-Michel sent me. He was very inspired by your face. He was inspired by my face? Yeah, don't act so surprised. You're really pretty. - That's very good of you. - Beer, dad? Yeah. Yeah, thanks, bud. - Oh, great! - Oh, my God! Amber Spear. Once your grounding is over, if your dad says it's okay, I would like to take you to the mall and get you some of these products. I would so love that. But just one condition, you gotta keep speaking properly. No more mumbling. Are you bribing me with makeup? Absolutely. Why not? I love this so much. I really do. - That was so good. - Josie, thank you. It was the classiest roast chicken I ever had. Oh, wow. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh, since I'm gonna be staying in Magdalene a while, I'm gonna need a car, I thought you might know someone. Yeah, of course. You just let me know when you're ready. I'll be there. Josephine! Josie. Hey. Josie, awake. - Oh! - Oh! It's my fault. - What are you doin' here? - I'm sorry. I came to bring you to the gym for a workout. Oh, I-I don't have any workout clothes. Well, Amber went on a fitness kick last year and, uh, there's the results. They're yours now. Have at it. You're up, slick. Uh, I-I'm not the most graceful of women. - Not in heels. - Also, not in heels. When are you not in heels? Well, this morning when I banged my head into your jaw. Come on, let's see it. Back at it. - Oh, I feel silly! - Stop it. You are nothing but class, head to toe. You're just little bit of a klutz. But you own it, baby, 'cause it's cute. - And because it's you. - You're very sweet. And you're very cute. We're going to a football game tomorrow night. Oh, that sounds fun. Does Connor play? Nah. Nah, he's a boxer like his old man. This place is gonna be his someday if he wants it. Excuse me. Are you new to women's league? Uh, I don't know what that is, so I guess that's a no. Good to know, seems like no one should put a glove to that face. - Name's Micky. - Josephine. Please tell me Jake is opening the gym to aerobics classes and you're the instructor. Oh, alas! I have to dash your dream! Did you lose something, Mick? She's with me. Comin' to the match Saturday night? What's up? Mick and I are in the league together. I'll drop off tickets at the box office for ya. Oh, you know what, if she wants to come, I think I can handle it. You got three kids and DeeDee to handle. I'll take her, okay? DeeDee's been gone for five months, Mick, but I kinda feel like you knew that. Right. We are gonna make cream puffs from scratch. - Awesome! - Hey, wait up. - Cream puffs, dude! - Awesome, little dude. - Hi, Connor. - Yo, Josie. You doing good? - I'm great. How are you? - Nothing gets me down. I-I love the rap, but I gotta clock in. Later, bro! You know they got cream puffs at the bakery. But I bet yours will be better. Well, people sometimes put sweet, whipped cream or vanilla pudding between the choux pastry which can be exasperating. We are gonna make creme patissiere. What's creme patissiere? Proof there is a God. Yo! Hey, Micky. Wanna check out the firehouse, little man? I'll look after your bags, you go in. Um, I'm supposed to be in charge of Ethan, I kinda need to keep an eye on him. Yo, Jimbo! My boy, Eth's in there! - Keep an eye on him, will you? - Alright, I got him. You have plans tomorrow night? Uh, Jake and I have plans tomorrow night. Are you and Jake an item? We're just friends. How about we do dinner, Sunday night? I'd like that, Micky. But I should go. Ethan and I are making cream puffs. Eth, you got cream puffs to make. - See you Sunday. - Bye. Hey, Josie, you going to dad and Micky's fight Saturday? - Yeah. - Awesome! I usually go, but Combat Raptor comes out tomorrow and I'm going to Josh's, and we're all going to the movies, and then I'm sleepin' over, I can't freaking wait! How do you know if you're gonna like it? Uh, Josie, it's Combat Raptor! Are Connor and Amber going to your dad's fight? Amber? No way. She'll be on a date with Noah. Connor normally always goes, but he's scrapin' off all his girlfriends. So, he'll probably be breaking some chick's heart Saturday night. Connor is breaking up with his girlfriends? - Dad laid down the law. - Uh-huh. - You wanna drive? - Sure. What? Get in the car! Here. You know, Lydie knitted this for me three Christmases ago. Aw! Thanks. I'm gonna get some cocoa, do you want some? Yeah. It's right over there. - Hi, you're Josie. - I am and you are? I'm Taylor, I'm Amber's bestest bestie. Well, one of them. She's spoken of you, like, lots. Your outfit is very chic. And you wear it well, it just needs a fedora. I know, right? But I'll be lucky if I don't get tripped, pushed, or run down before the night is through, destroying these trousers. Well, small-minded fools are everywhere, and those who have the courage to be who they are often have to suffer them. You totally looked through Amber like she wasn't even there. - You done with her yet? - Amber Spear is a total tease. And her dad's a pain in my ass. Won't let her go to the Bounce concert. She's hot, but if Amber likes her cherry that much, she can keep it. - Are you Noah? - Yeah, I'm Noah. Well, Noah, you should know that Amber won't be going to the concert with you because she and the Taylors are going with me. I'm a friend of Lavon's and he doesn't like a lot of people backstage. And Amber wanted to give her backstage passes to her best besties. Oh, and as for your idea that Amber's a tease, she isn't, she's just not that into you. So, please, you totally look through Amber. It'll save you some frustration and maybe heartbreak when she finds out how shallow you are and cuts you loose. Holy shit. Oh, and one final thing, badmouthing a woman when everyone can hear is just bad manners. Says nothing about the woman and everything about your own character. You may wanna move forward, Taylor. - We're losing the line. - That was epic. Well, we gotta hurry up and text Amber. I so totally told you, Amber. He's completely up his own ass. He is, girlfriend, he is so not worth putting up with all of this. I think that's true, I think I maybe even said that to him and probably fibbed a bit. You fibbed? I told him I was taking you and the Taylors to Bounce. But first, you guys need to get permission from your parents and I need to discuss it with your father. And second, you need to tread very carefully tonight. I have no idea how he's gonna react to my little talk. He called me a tease? - He acted like he liked me. - I mean, he probably does. He just has to show a certain face to his friends. But, Josie, I've liked him since, like, forever. I know, i-it's just... He may not live up to what you thought he would be. - He was totally a douche. - He's always been a douche. It's completely inappropriate for me to call a teenage boy a douche, but you're right, he was a total douche. Ugh! I hate you! - No, no. Mia! - Go away. Uh-oh! He's cutting Mia off, and she's not takin' it well. - Whoo! - Nice. Oh, I have a few things to tell you. Uh, with your permission I'd like to take Amber and the Taylors to see Bounce in Boston. Oh, and Amber and Noah, if they were ever together, they're broken up, I maybe partially responsible for that. It's likely there'll be some teenager-girl moods in your house for the foreseeable future and I'd like to apologize for that in advance. Jesus, slick, how long were you gone? Hey. Ellie. We need to talk. Amber. That's my girl. You take good care of her. I think I get more out of it than she does. Oh, then you think wrong, slick. Come on. Thanks. - This is Jake. - Hey. How are Connor and Amber? Hey! Uh, well... Amber's doing little better than Con, Connor had kind of a rough night. He, uh, broke up with Mia. But then, uh, his final choice, Ellie, dumped him when, uh, he told her that she had made the cut. Oh. I'm not sure "made the cut" was the right choice of words. Yeah, you think? Are you working out? Yeah, somethin' like that. I'll call you later. Alright, slick. - Josephine. - Hi! How are you doing? Jet-lagged. Just got to Paris. I-I need some help, I need some advice. I'm going to a boxing match tonight and I don't know what to wear. Why are you going to a fight, Josephine? I've been asked by the fighters. Plural? That's my Josephine girl there. Been there a couple weeks and she's setting Maine on fire with her ice. You smoke everything you put on, but you gonna have to trick yourself out. Man see a girl sittin' ringside and shit's hot, and she's lookin' all ice cold, that might be some ammunition for him to kick some serious ass. Tricked out it is. How you doin' otherwise? I have my moments, but gran had good friends and they're taking care of me. Good! I'mma check my schedule in the next couple of weeks and see if I can come check you out. - I hope so, I'd love that. - Alright. - I'mma talk to you later. - Bye. Alright. Hi. Josephine Malone. Here you are. Thank you. Right. - Hey. Oh. - I'm Alyssa. Junior's woman. Hi. Josephine. I know. Jake's woman. Word gets around. So, Junior's up next, he's fighting Micky. But don't worry when Micky messes him up. Nobody beats Mick but Jake. Then again, Jake messes everyone up. I'm sorry? Junior doesn't care. He gets to celebrate after anyway, win or lose. You get me? Nothing better than a fighter after a fight, all that aggression, all that adrenaline still flowing. Mm... I love fight night. Let's go. Fight's on. Let's go! Mess him up, baby! Go, tiger. Is this your first fight? You'll get me, honey. Get ready for the ride of your life, girlfriend. Oh, come on. Come on, baby. Go, baby! I love you, Tiger! I love you, Tiger! Come on, baby! I love you, Tiger! Whoo! Break it up, break it up, break it up. Break it. Come on, come on. Go. - One, two, three. - Come on, baby. Get up. Get up! - Get up, baby. Get up! - Four, five. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. You're out. Come on, come on. Let me see the eyes, let me see the eyes. Winner! Good job. I gotta go. Get my post-fight drilling from my man. So quick, give me your number. We'll do drinks or lunch or something. - Come on, hurry. I gotta go. - Okay. Come on, I gotta go. Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck... Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck... Commence boxing. - Come on. - Box him. Box him. - That's it. - One more. You got him down. - One more. - Get him. Get him. Get him! - Yes! - Come on, Truck! He's out of gas, Truck! You got this! Give him the left, baby! Give him the left! Nine, ten. That's it. That's it. He's out. Winner, Truck! Who do you belong to, gorgeous? Jake. End of the hall, last door on the left. You going out with Micky tomorrow night? Not anymore. Good answer, slick. Panties off. Jake. Stay close to me. Hey. Class! Plough by the Truck. You shut your fucking mouth. Okay. Now, you're somewhere safe. We had sex in a locker room. Yeah. Yeah, we did. Were you upset before the fight? No. Look, you made a date with another guy. You said I wasn't your type. Yeah, I know what I said. But I didn't like it when I said it. And then, you came to the gym to ask me for my help... And I, I thought... I think I might've missed something. Look, I was playing it cool, but I thought I was being kinda obvious. I'm scared. Hey. You don't have to be scared. Not with me. There are things you don't know about me. You get that Lydie told me about you, right? Yeah, but something happened to me tonight. When you were boxing, it's like, I was coming out of my skin. You think maybe, instead of coming out of your skin what you were feeling, was that disguise starting to drop? What disguise? That one you've been wearing for a long time, babe. I saw you met Alyssa. You guys get along? How do you like her? Oh, she's lovely. Little loud. I really like her. Yeah, she's a good woman. She asked for my number. Good. I mean, you know, you got me and the kids, but women need other women to have their backs. Jake. What happens now? I don't know, Josie. Morning, slick. Mm. Fancy. Hey, don't you, uh, owe Mick a call? Hello? Hi. Uh, Micky? Let me guess, Jake's standing right next to you. Yeah. That's where I'd be. I-I assume you know why I'm calling. The way Jake looked at you and the way you looked at him, I knew I had a sliver of a chance at best. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. Jake's a good guy. He just had shit taste in women, until now. Thanks, Micky. You're welcome. Good luck, okay? Josie, I'm so glad you're here. I so have to talk to you. Come on. You'll never guess what happened. - Alexi Prokorov said hey to me. - Who? Only the coolest guy in the entire school. So, we were at the diner last night and he walks right up to me and he says, "Hey," right to me. Alexi doesn't date girls from Magdalene High. He has a motorcycle, and he plays guitar, and he's in a band. He's dreamy. This is huge. The one guy who beats out Noah is Alexi. He writes his own songs. I heard his band play at the underage club that used to be an old garage down by the cove. It was amazing. And Noah's called me twice. She's gonna break it off with him. I think that's really smart, Amber. Josie, he came right up to our table and said, "Hey," right to me. It was the best moment of my life. Hey, where did everybody go? Dip's up. Rotel dip? I'm starved. Taylor. Is this, uh, Alexi a decent guy? He gets straight-A's, his music really is super cool, and I hear he's a one-woman man. But Mr. Spear is gonna freak way out. Get 'em while it's hot. Everything good? For Amber, yes. For you, uh, not so much. Uh, new guy said, "Hey," to her at the diner last night. And he has a motorcycle. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Is it time to workout? I have new workout clothes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is. But the workout I had in mind, it actually doesn't require clothes. You better tell me who you are quick. Jake, I presume? Oh, my God! Henry. Is this a joke? The way you talk about Jake you failed to mention just how close you two were getting. Okay, Henry. I-I know it's awkward, but I didn't expect you to be here. Just think about this for a second. It's not surprising to me. Hey, little thing. I know she's good, but she goes back for seconds. Henry! What'd you think, after 23 years, the men you've been through don't talk to each other? I mean, hell, half of them have already had you. Why are you talking to me like this? Because I'm sick and tired of waiting for you to be done so I can have my turn. Your turn? I have... I have loved you since you first walked into the interview two decades ago. - What? - Since the beginning... You have been everywhere with me. I have taken more photographs of you than anybody else. But you've always been with other women. And you didn't give a fuck! You don't care. And you're never gonna care. So now I don't care. Hey, listen be careful because what she does is she gives you just enough to get you wanting and then she just leaves you. I'm pretty sure she knows she does that. You listen to me. Anyone who talks to you like that doesn't deserve you. He was my friend. No. He's an idiot. He didn't have the guts to work for what he wanted. It's just ridiculous for him to say he loved me. Hey, Lydie knew. She doesn't want him for you. She knew that the man for you was gonna have to care enough to do the work. You're worth it. Josephine. I'm not sure I'm ready to talk to you. Well, I'm here to sever our professional relationship. 'Cause it's no longer constructive. So, this is it. Yeah, this is it. Except for gran, for 23 years, you were the only real thing I had. Look, I'm not sure what kind of happiness you think you're gonna find with a, a small-town strip club owner, but, hey, Josephine, if that's what you want, you know, you got a clear shot. You know, my first living memory is my father slamming my mother's head against the kitchen floor. She left us... and never came back. Sometime after that when dad found out I was dating a boy without his permission, he beat me so badly, I was in the hospital for a week. Gran saved me from all that. She sent me to college. I fell in love, or so I thought until the first time he hit me. I came back to gran after that, too. Did you ever wonder why I was so remote, Henry? Honey, I-I never... You never told me about any of this. I was so in love with you, when we first started working together every day was painful. It was either put up with the pain or risk losing one of the only two people in my life that I cared about. You were in love with me? Head over heels. You felt the same way as I did? And neither of us did anything about it. - It wasn't meant to be. - How do we know that? We never even gave this a shot. Because I am falling in love with someone I've only known two weeks. I should've been at gran's funeral, okay? I've... I've messed this up. - We both did. - Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I do want you to be happy. Goodbye, Josephine. Sister, you can't sell Jake any of that. When you got a guy like Jake Spear, you do not inform him that the hot guy who's been in love with you for decades came to you and lowered the boom when he wasn't around. Uh-huh. Come on. Can I ask you a hypothetical question? Shoot. Hey, uh, you wanna talk in the office? What's up? Well, first, can I just say Alyssa told me that I shouldn't? Okay. Well, what works for Alyssa and Junior has nothing to do with us. So, why don't you just tell me what happened? Henry came to Lavender House yesterday and he-he cares for me a lot. And now that I'm moving on, it's difficult for him to take. Is there more? Uh, he kissed me. I-it was a goodbye. Listen to me. Never keep anything from me. Okay? I know plenty about what doesn't work between men and women. And I know for a fact that keeping things from each other just doesn't work. Now I'm gonna react how I react, but you never have anything to be afraid of. I know Alyssa's a good woman. She meant well. But you and I gotta find our own way. You with me, Josie? I'm with you, Jake. Are you upset? No. But you're gonna have to make it up to me. So what do you think? You wanna make it up to me by giving me a kiss or you wanna make it up to me by letting me fuck you on this desk? The second one. Good answer, slick. Amond, who is an amazing hip-hop artist and friend of mine. Found out that Henry fired me. And I told him I'm staying in Maine and I met someone. He wants to come check you out. Oh, really? Check me out, huh? Alright. Bring it on. I'll tell you what. You can send every singer, dancer, musician, sculptor, whatever you got to come check me out. I don't mind. I mean, they're the only family you have, right? I wanna know that part of your life, too. I want it all. You just keep getting more wonderful. Jake. Boston, Terry and my uncle are all here at Lavender House. Okay. I'm not far. I'll be right there. Damn it. Hello, Josephine. We need to discuss matters. No. Not until Jake gets here. - Why don't we wait inside? - We're not going inside. You're not welcome here. If you wanna discuss business matters, we need to do that in town. Hey. If you wanna talk to someone, you can talk to me. What's going on? Lydia Malone made a highly unusual bequest in her will which indicated she was not of right mind when she wrote it. She also forgot her son. Did you discuss the terms of the will with this man? Well, Davis Malone, as the only direct living descendent of Lydia Malone is entitled to know the particulars of his mother's last requests. That's not what I asked you. What I asked you was, did you discuss the terms of Lydia's will with Boston Stone? You mentioned Stone at the will reading and now seem to be colluding with him. I'm hardly colluding with him. I see. So this isn't a play to sell Lavender House, let Malone pocket the profits and then let Boston Stone bulldoze the building or whatever the hell else he wants to do with the property. Bullshit! Barred from my childhood home? You never lived here. You abandoned her. You abandoned both of us. Mr. Malone is willing to be reasonable and discuss a fair distribution of assets. Once Lavender House is sold. You're Josephine's attorney. Ernie is Josephine's attorney. You work for the same law firm. It's a conflict of interest. I'll be calling your partners in the morning. You're gonna wanna prepare for that. Just let us in the goddamn house, will you? Nobody is going in the house. Josephine will speak to you at a meeting that you will arrange in town. Meanwhile, the three of you will get off this property or I'll be calling the sheriff. Is there anything I've said that's unclear? I'm calling the kids. They're coming here, and we're staying with you. Nobody is taking this house from you. Hey, everybody, there's about 3,000 cars pulling up the drive! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't believe... Oh, my gosh. - Josephine! Oh! - Amond! Damn. I'm so glad you're here. I see why you wouldn't wanna leave. Come meet everybody. - Amber. Jake's daughter. - Hi. - How you doin', Amber? - Connor, the oldest. - What's up, man? - How you doin'? - You alright? - This is Ethan. - Jake's youngest. - Ethan, what's going on? Oh. I get a hug? Alright. Okay. - Awesome. - And this is Jake. Oh, shoot. You're the Truck. Whoa, dad, he knows you. Josephine, you didn't tell me that your fighter was the Truck. I saw you at Vegas when you fought Di Matteo. - You messed him up. - You're a fight fan, huh? - Hell, yeah. - Of course. - Man. - Good to meet you, man. Pleasure to meet you, too. Well, welcome. Come on in. - Alright. - Yeah. - You look so good. - Yeah. You look good, girl. - Phi, Josephine. - Hey. - So glad you came. - It's cool. Amber, you good? You eatin'? Pleased to meet you. See your friend's girl? Your boy's over here sweatin' her. Seein' as good as she look at night. He noticed it, but he doesn't know what to do with it. His blindfold been taken off. - What's goin' on? Good? - How you doin'? I love this place. Connor's on the prowl, target Sophie. - Mm, Amond pointed that out. - Yeah. Well, if something happens, they'll be really cute together. Mm-hm. Well, I remember what it was like to be a 17-year-old boy. You remember what it's like to be a 16-year-old girl? And newsflash, so does Alyssa. He tried the meatballs. Yo, you're not gonna believe this. Dee Amond just walked in and asked to see you. Send him in. - What's up, brother? - How you doin'? - Good. And you? - Good. I see you got yourself a titty bar. Yup. What I wanna know is what's going on with Josephine. Is there something that she don't wanna tell me? Yeah. Her uncle's contesting the will. He's old, but he's got a long history of being a supreme asshole. What's the deal with this uncle? Well, I was close with her grandmother and she told me that she hasn't spoken to her son in 28 years. Not since she got custody of Josephine because her other son was beating the hell out of his daughter. The uncle's just in it for the money. So her father used to put her in the hospital? Mm-hm. Yeah. But he's dead. He died in prison. Unfortunately, his brother didn't. I didn't know any of this shit. Does he have a name? Why? You wading in? Yeah. Alright. Davis Malone. I think he's bankrolled by Boston Stone. Some local big-man. And their lawyer works at the same firm that represents Josephine. - That's conflict of interest. - Mm-hm. So with the other two, how dirty do you want it? Hey, I just want her breathin' easy. That house is all she has left of her grandmother. So where are you with dirty? Oh... And my hand's gotta stay clean. I got three kids and Josie to worry about. I'mma go take care of the problem. In the meantime, I'mma go out there and scope out some of your talent. You do that. I got you. Alright. - Jake. - Shh, shh. Keep the lights off. Grab your phone, you hear something you don't like, call 911. Oh, my God. Yes. Uh... This is Josephine Malone. Uh, 10, Lavender Lane. We're experiencing a-a break-in. Hey, hey. Stop right there. Put it down. Drop it. Josie, hey, uh, dad's got your uncle. What're you doing here? Hm? It's alright. Hey. Yeah. No, it's okay. The guy who broke in is like 700 years old. Uh... Yeah, no, we understand. Uh, thank you. Um, the police are on their way. - Stupid motion sensor lights. - God, you're an idiot. What did you think you were gonna accomplish? Respect your uncle, girl! Well, I would, if you'd give me one miniscule reason to do that. - Jake, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. The side window isn't. You're gonna pay for that. How? Give you blood? Girl, I broke in so I can get something to pawn so I can get gas money to get home. That bitch lawyer got her ass fired over conflict of interest and that Boston guy isn't helping me out anymore. What the hell do you want me to do? Well, you're gonna have a free place to stay tonight. Because I am absolutely pressing charges. I'm gonna make coffee. Jake, would you like some coffee? Yeah, babe. Got it. Hey, babe, I think you might need to come here. You get the hell off my property before I slap a restraining order on you. I came to apologize. I was told that if I apologize to you, some unfortunate things that have been happening to me would disappear. Now, call off your guys. My guys? You know what I'm talking about. Tell them I apologized, and this will all go away. Amond, babe. - Amond. - Mm-hm. Okay. Here's the deal. My uncle needs a ride home. I'll drop the charges against him if you make sure he gets back. And give him plenty of financial incentive to stay there. - Financial incentive, no. - No? Well, you got yourself into this mess. Fine. I'll see to your uncle. Now. Just call them off at your earliest convenience. Of course, but the Ravens are playing and I really like their uniforms. So it'll have to be after the game. Ooh! Come on, Eth, let's go! Hurry up! - Bye. - Bye. I love my days. I take Ethan to school, you opened the gym, and then this. Mm... I got a kid coming in. - I gotta get to work. - Oh... Oh, you make leaving hard. Put some clothes on, will ya? Hey, slick, you seen my keys anywhere? Did gran give you these? What, you're going through my desk? The picture was out, the letters were out. Did she give you these letters and that picture? Yes. Did you read them? - Josie... - Did you read them, Jake? - Yes. - How many times? W-why does that matter? It matters to me. How many times? Josie. Look, you knew, you knew Lydie told me about you. I-I knew that she told you about me. I-I just didn't know that she s-shared all my private letters with you. Why would she do that? When did she give these to you? Five or six years ago. Five or six years. You've known this much about me for five or six years? Lydie did not betray you. - You... - Don't. Keep away from me. I swear to God, I'll leave and you will never see me again. Okay, c-calm down. Alright? Just take a breath. We can talk. I'm not gonna take a breath. Do you not find it strange? She gave me to you before she gave me to you. Every secret... E-everything that was mine to give. Yeah, well, would you have given it? I would've liked to have had the option. Even so, if gran had some grand scheme which seems clear, maybe you could've shared that with me. Look... Look, it happened. Alright? I mean, we are what we are now. - So what does it matter? - Because I have... I have questions, and you're the only person in this room with the answers, and you're not giving them to me. Why can't you tell me? Because it doesn't matter. You are keeping something from me. Look, babe, you have all of me. No. - You got all of me. - Alright, look, can we please... We need to be able to move on from this. Just let this go. No, we can't move on. Not until you tell me what you and gran have been up to for the last five or six years. We had your best interest at heart. Yeah, if you did, then I would've met you instead of you and your kids being kept from me. No one's been kept from anybody. - Why would she do this to me? - Why? - Why? - Let it go! How is it that we could be... as close as two people could get half hour ago... and now we're done? Look, I understand you don't want to talk to me, but... the kids miss you. I miss you. Please call me. Josie stood me up for lunch. Finally got through to her late last night. She said things have changed. She's putting Lavender House on the market, taking some job with some designer in New York City. I'll take care of it. Well, you better hurry, Jake, because she didn't sound right. - Hello? - Boy, I'm glad you picked up. Yeah, my Sophia's in the clink. - In jail? - Well, school jail, with Connor. Apparently, Mia got all up in his face about how he ruined her life, and Sophia tried to help. I just got to the school. Is Jake there? Girl, I don't know where Jake is. - That's why I'm calling you. - I'm coming. Okay. Thank you. Magdalene High School, how may I help? Yes, that's correct. - May I help you? - Hi. I-I'm here for Connor Spear. Um, I'm his... His, um, um... She's with me. Listen. It was me that refused to see you. Lydie told me, I don't know how many times. The first time I walked into Lavender House and I looked at your picture... I knew I could fall in love with you and... and it scared me to death. And every word Lydie said just made it worse. And I knew that if you didn't want what I had to offer, that, uh... that it would gut me. And I couldn't let that happen, so... Lydie gave me a picture. And then she gave me those letters. You are everything I ever wanted. God, I love you! Oh... Gran, uh, left this in her safety deposit box. Josie, my buttercup. If you're listening to this, I'm gone. And by the time you listen to this, you'll have met Jake. I knew the moment I saw him that he was perfect for you. I also knew from the expression on his face when he first saw your picture. He knew you were perfect for him, too. I wanted you to be happy, buttercup. So I did what I needed to do. I gave you to Jake, and in doing so, I gave Jake to you. My girl, know this, and never forget. It's never too late to reach for happiness. And last, Josie, thank you for being the light of my life. I treasured you from the moment you were born. Goodbye, my precious girl. I love you always, forever, and completely. Hey, guys. - Can Sophie come to dinner? - Alexi, too? I'll be exasperated if we don't have cream puffs for dessert. Get in here. Yes! - Ooh! - Oh! Oh, you'll love it.
