CHRISTIANE F. WE CHILDREN FROM ZOO STATION Piss and shit all over the place; just take a good look at it At first sight it looks fine, with its lawns... ...and shopping centres But the staircases of the flats stink What can kids do, when they're playing outside? They'll shit themselves waiting for the lift, so they go in the lobby I've lived here since I was six, with my mother, sister and cat I've had enough of it The posters are all over town "Sound. Europe's latest disco" I want to go to it One Saturday I told mother I'd sleep over at Kessi's Kessi is top of my class, everyone approves of her She's got real tits already; I admire her "Sound" is her second home; she's here every Saturday She's taking me for the first time Get a move on! Is she sixteen? Sure, in my class -Is Atze here? -When is he never here? Put your bag there. You can't walk around with a plastic bag here Wait here Cherry juice We're in the cinema Crazy stuff -Won't you have some? -I'm not in the mood yet -Your first, eh? -Don't talk crap Stop that You shouldn't have taken that trip Too much for you?
