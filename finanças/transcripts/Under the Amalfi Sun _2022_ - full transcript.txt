Incoming call from Mom Irene. Incoming call from Mom Irene. Hello, Mom. Sweetheart. Hi, honey. Have you arrived? No, we're still on the way. We're picking up Cami at the airport, then we'll head to the house. But I should be asking how you are? You'll be careful, right? Mom, yes, we're just on the boat. - Oh, right, I thought you were driving. - We're great. How are you? I'm fine. Why are you worried about me all of a sudden? I don't know, it just... you haven't gotten away with the guy in ten years. I... Look, Lucio and I went on vacation last year together. No, no, no. Last year, we went on vacation and that's when you met him. Yeah. Uh, give my best to Camilla and the others, and... - Please, honey. Call me once in a while. - All right. - I will. See you, Ma. - Bye. Okay, bye. Bye. Your son is right, don't you think? I mean, this vacation will be a good test for us, right? No, it's just that... It's his first time going away without me. More importantly, it's your first time going without him. Listen, how about a plate of Scialatelli Amalfitana instead of going to Sicily? Mm-hm. Well, I'm not doing it for you, okay? It's just that planned vacations... have never been my thing. No! I can't believe we're actually here. - Oh, my God. Let's go. - We did it. You're gonna be fine, okay? At least you have a boyfriend. I'm alone. A thousand miles away from home like a goldfish in the ocean. I'm surrounded by sharks. Oh, what's up? - I'm... I'm a little bit scared. - Why? What if it's different? What if something has changed? One year far away, it's so long. Uh, fat dude with a stroller, some nuns, a beautiful girl with red hair. - Where, where? - It's not her, Vinz, it's not her. Just stay calm, okay, dude? You're a bit too nervous. It's like a major tactical error that showed too much excitement. Who cares about strategy? Dude, I wanna ask her to live with me. - Are you stupid? - Stop. Vincenzo, cohabitation murders relationships. Everyone says that. Because they've never met a girl like Camilla. But what do you know about living with her? Nothing yet. Our vacation together will be a... a test. - A test. - A test. - Curly hair... - Cami! Cami! Oh, sweetie. Hi! Hello! - I missed you so much. - Me too. How are you? Hey. Hey. - And this is Nathalie. Vincenzo. - Ah... What's up? - Hey! How are you? - Vincenzo. And I'm Furio. Uh, this guy's friend. Well, Vincenzo's friend. This guy is kinda... Anyway, you are Nat? - Camilla's roommate. - Yeah. - It's very nice to meet you. - You too. I'm really glad I'm finally visiting, because I wanna learn about the culture, learn about Italian art, Italian music. And Camilla told me so much... about you. And about everyone else. I love Italian culture. - Hi. - And you can learn about Italian guys. Anyway, it's wonderful to meet you, uh... Because you know, it's great to meet, uh, new people of the other sex, you know. - Girls, I mean. - Yeah. Bye. I think I should have rehearsed that better. Anyway, we already clicked, huh? - I'll catch up with her. See you, guys. - Okay. - Hey, I missed you, dude! - And I you! I wasn't joking. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, so where is my pineapple pizza? Go back. Now. - I'm joking. I was just joking. - It's not funny. It was just a joke. Come on, Vinz. Here we go. Here we go! We made it, huh? - Thank God. - At least we can eat now. After like 800 steps... Here we are. My goodness, it's so beautiful here, guys. Oh, god. What a view, huh? Wow! Impressive, Vincenzino. Ah, I can't believe this. It's so exciting. Look at this. Wow. This is crazy. Vinz, any chance your dad would wanna adopt me? Long-distance works. Come on. Check out the inside. Welcome you guys. Here's the living room. Uh, right here is the dining room and the bathroom's down the hall. We sleep there. - Who's in that painting? - That one? - Yeah. - That's my father. Oh... You have the same nose. Oh, wait. There should be a cabinet with two shelves on it - and a golden crab sitting on top. - Yeah. I see it. Uh, please just make sure you don't touch it. It's my dad's and it's worth a fortune. - Got it? - Mm-hm. - You're touching it, right? - No. Cami and I will sleep over there. Furio, you and Nathalie will sleep here, there's two singles. Wait. I have to sleep with Furio? You said that with a mix of excitement and terror. Listen, and listen carefully. If you try to watch me while I'm showering or I'm undressing, I will kill you. - So just terror, then. - This vacation will be lovely. Let's go. I'll show you around town. This place is so wonderful. You haven't seen anything yet. - Thank you. - Salvatore. - Hey, Vince. - Yeah. - Is it really you? - This is Camilla. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Camilla. - Very pretty, but above all, very lucky. - Right. - Above all, she's just very lucky. - All right. You got it. See you. - Vince, it's been so long. Welcome back. - Thanks. - Hey, Vince! - Oh, god, they've got buffalo mozzarella. - Hi. - Hi. - And who is this beautiful girl? - This is my girlfriend. I can't believe you just showed up without saying a thing. You're so beautiful. - Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you. - My pleasure. Camilla. - Genna! Were you looking for Vincenzo? - Hey, Vincenzo. - How are you? - Gennaro. I'm great, you? - Same here. - Bye, Genna. - See you. - See you later. - They're so nice. - Yeah, I know. Come on, I'll take you somewhere special. - This one is wonderful. - Let me feel it. - It's beautiful. - It is, right? Yeah, the fabric is so light too. Okay, it's done. - What if I wear it tonight? - Sure. I can't believe we can't find a single room anywhere in Amalfi. That's it. If I can't find a room, I'm sleeping here. Well, I do know of a more comfortable place than these steps here. Oh, where? Mm. Well, I... I... I can't do it. Can you sleep like this? Yes. Well, I almost started to. At least with this, we have the view of a five-star hotel. The first time I slept in a car, that must have been in the 90s, - after a concert. - Yeah. I remember the first time I slept in a car too. In Corsica, it was a 2CV. The seats didn't recline even. But my girlfriend was some athlete. Oh. So you weren't alone? You had a girl there with you? Mm. - Are you jealous retroactively? - No. Mm. - What was her name? - Paola. Ah, you still remember that. Ah. Jeez, I was 20. Just like Vincenzo. Hey. Don't with Vincenzo now. I don't wanna talk about it. - Mm. - You in your 2CV with Paola, and him with Camilla in the bed where he was conceived. Oh, my God. Now, I'll never sleep. Piece of information I could have dealt without knowing. Goodnight. Ah, retroactive jealousy? Hm. Mm. Oh, right. - What is that? - What? - That. - What, this? Yeah. Ah. Well, it's a whistle. This was my grandfather's. He knows her. So my grandpa had it on the day he met my nana. After that, he gave it to my dad who met my mom. It's basically got three generations of lifeguard saliva in it. - Uh... - Do you wanna try it? No, Christ. Hey, Vinz. There's a super creepy guy - who keeps, like, staring at me. - Where? Well, yeah, he's coming towards us now. Vinz! Vinz! - How are you? - I'm good, I'm good. How are you? - Great. - Guys, this is Hans. He's, um, like... - the brother I never had. - Oh. Hey, I'm a soon-to-be adopted brother. - Nice to meet you. - For sure. Yeah, we spent every summer together here since... since we were kids. Uh, this is Camilla. - It's a pleasure. Camilla. - Pleasure. Nathalie. - Nathalie. - Hans. Hey pal, wanna grab a drink? - Yeah. - Come on. Make some noise up there! Seriously, man? Okay. We'd practiced for weeks. You remember your part? Yeah, of course, dude. Just focus, okay? You're gonna kill it, let's go. Oh, my god, what's he gonna do? - I'll wait in the crowd. - Where the hell are you going? - You got this. - I can't sing, man. Let's get a round of applause for... Vi... Vincenzo. What are you singing for us? - All right, Vinz! - The song I'm about to sing is a song that, well, I know the words by heart. Because it's what I've been listening to - all year while... - Hit it, Vinz! ...while my girl was away in Canada. And, Camilla, I'm so happy that you're back. Thanks, guys. Oh, my god, I cannot believe he's doing this. I'm shocked, believe me. By the way, this is Camilla, huh. - Camilla's right here. - Please. I'm begging you. ♪ Your every thought, your every move ♪ ♪ Your every silence More and more every day ♪ ♪ I find in everything you do I see in everything you are ♪ ♪ The girl That I've always been dreaming of ♪ Oh, by the way, that's Camilla. - Oh, my God. - The chick with the red hair.

That was for Camilla. Cami, I love you. - Thank you. Thanks, guys. - Go, Vinz! So one thing I don't get... ...even the biggest loser in real life can get somewhere on social media. - What's wrong with me? - May I? Mm. Well... Man, you have no swag at all. Swag? - Mm. - I heard that from my ex. How long were you with your ex then? We went on one date so... And was this relationship the longest one you've had? Hans, try to grasp big. You're looking at someone who's never been loved. Mm. But has a lot... A lot of love to give. Uh, Rebecca? No? All eyes are on her, but she's looking at no one. This is Lucio, my partner. - It's nice to meet you. - You too, Lucio. Hi, there. So, you slept in the car? Oh, well, it was late. We didn't wanna bug you, guys. You couldn't bug us. I mean, this is your house too. You even have your own home here. - Oh, really? - Uh-huh. - Oh, that... that one? - Yeah. Oh, no, wonderful, that's great. It's just that, uh... Vincenzo can't find out we're here. - Hans, everything fine? He's fine? - Yeah, he's all right. He's in Cala Ventresca with Vincenzo and the others. - All right. Cala Ventresca. - Uh-huh. But, uh, doesn't it have the rocky road to the beach that's... Yes. No. Don't worry, Irene. You can also use it to dodge an answer. - Like... "Boh." - Okay. There's another way. And remember the shoulders, very important. - Then there's "Beh." - Watch out. Right here. When you hear something interesting, not too bad of an idea. - "Beh." Right? - Keep going. And then there's "Bah," from when you hear some bullshit, you say... "Bah." - Got it? - Bah... Well, she's a fast learner. Uh-huh. Cami. Vinz, sorry, here I am. Look, no one's forcing us to jump here. You know, why don't we join them there? There's so many rocks here. There's one on the right, and there's one on the left. - Mm-hm. - I don't know, I feel like... It's better to leave it alone. Let's go, all right? - But it's clear down there. - Yes. It's clear there, why? - Are you ready? - Huh? - Fly! - No! - Ooh! - Are you crazy? - What if there's something down here? - Babe... I wanna do it all with you. Whoa! Watch it! You guys are both nuts! Oh-ooh! Hey, Nat! What's with the T-shirt? We're at the beach, girl, not in Canada. It's better to wear it. No sunburns and no jellyfish stings. - Wait, are there jellyfish? - Well, who knows. I'm allergic to jellyfish, you guys. You could have told me first. You ready? Sure. I've got some news. Here. - Thanks. - You're welcome. What? Are you kidding me? No. I just got the email this morning. Come on, you just got the job as a teaching assistant. Cami, it's amazing. Yeah, but it means another year in Canada. Yeah, but it's a great opportunity. I know, super great. Especially to mess things up even more. This place and Brigitte have really... - convinced me to stop being such a nomad. - Ah... That summer changed my life, it shook me up, you know? Wasn't it the same year that we met Irene and Roberto? Ah, exactly, yeah. - Vincenzo's all right then? - Ah... Oh, he's all grown up now. Remember when he and Hans would hang around us all the time? - It was almost annoying. - Yes. They were almost like clingy baby chicks. Oh, that's right. And Roberto told them that if they wandered too far away... - What... what was it? - He said if they wandered away they would turn into werewolves. - Huh? - Oh! Mm-hm. - Oh. - Mm. Well, there's a lot you still don't know about me. He was just saying that the house is beautiful. You should have seen it 20 years ago. - It was a mess. - That's right. Do you remember? We would never have managed to renovate it if it weren't for Irene and Roberto. Uh-huh. Again with Roberto. If you come in, I'll kill you, Furio. Come on, we're gonna be late for the party. Yes. Five minutes. - Do you like it? - It's beautiful. Hey, they put some new lights up here, sweet, right? - Cami, have you seen how wonderful? - Look, it's gorgeous. - Hey, they have limoncello shots. - Oh. Uh, Vinz. Oh, excuse us. Oh, wait, wait, wait. How the hell do you do this? Walking in high heels is harder than... I don't know, waxing a bear. That's a weird metaphor. Mm, okay. - Try this. - Okay. - Do small steps. - Yeah. And don't bend your knees too much. Okay. - Yeah. - No. No, no. Not going to work. Let's go buy some sandals. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is this the way to wake people up? You tomato-head. Who are you calling tomato-head? I'm older than you. Cut it out, you mozzarella-head. Give me the stick, you tomato-head. Yo, Hans. Whatever you did to my profile, it's working great. See, dude? But what else did I tell you? What? What did you tell me? The red Bermuda shorts, Furio. - It's not ever... Right. - Not ever, never. Okay. Got it. REBECCA HAS ACCEPTED YOUR FRIENDSHIP REQUEST No, wait. Hans, bro, I love you. I love you. - What? - Rebecca accepted my follow request. Awesome. Yeah, awesome, but... but now I need a, a killer pick-up line, man. - Something that I gotta write, all right? - Yeah. Uh, but do you know how many guys write Rebecca each day? - How many... - Like a ton. Ton. Yeah, of course. So then how do you get to the top of this girl's list? I just kill the other guys? - Uh... no. - No? You gotta think of something to tell her that no one else has. "I want to be the father of your children." - Sleep on it, Furio. - No, no, no. - No. No, I don't want anything. No, no. - Get yourself a lucky charm. Come on. - You want one? - No, no, no. - I don't want anything. - Huh? You sure? - Come on. Do you want a photo? Come on... - No. Absolutely not. - We'll do it together. - No. - Are you two a couple? - No. - You want a photo with the princess, huh? - Yes. Yeah, let's just take one, so he leaves, okay? - Come on. - Thanks. All right, smile, guys. Look here. Okay. It will just take a second to print out. - I appreciate it. - Thanks a lot. Hey, thanks, brother. See ya. Thanks. Can I see it? No, it's blurred. - What? Oh. - Blurred. - Do you know what those are? - Puppets, huh. Puppets, yeah. Oh, you're so beautiful and so in love. Would you like to know the future of your own hands? No, no. Thanks. Come on, it'll only cost you five euros. Hey, come on, it'll be fun. Let's do it. Come on. All right. Let's see what these cards have to say. - Here you go. - Okay. Shit. - This one's death. - Dang, here we go. No, this card just means that a very big change will be coming to you guys. But a positive one? Oh, I don't know that, girl. But... Can you tell us where we'll be in a few months? Of course. Far away. - Very far. - Uh... I think she's reading our past, not our future, huh. Do you like Hans? Furio. Furio. Furio. Oh, you ripped it. Happy now? Oh, I ripped it? Yeah, you know, there's nothing wrong with it. He's a stud. You like him? While this trip... it's just my boyfriend was coming too. But my love story is a very bad story, so... - Hey, if you were Rebecca. - Mm-hm. Could you go out with... - With, uh, who? - A guy like me? I don't know. I'm not Rebecca. But I think it's worth her giving you a chance. Hey, well, see, if you put your mind to it, you can actually say something nice. Yeah, don't get used to it. - Huh? - Don't get used to it. You're wearing my shirt. - Why, am I not allowed? - Of course. - Hey, Cami. - Mm? - I've found a job in a call center. - You did? Hey, you've got work? - Yeah. - You didn't say anything. I know, I wanted for it to be a surprise. I know it's not that job of my dreams but at least now, we can afford a little place. I already told my mom, and she put down the deposit. If you wanna do it... we can move in together next month. That's amazing. We have to make up for all the time that we lost last year. What? What did I do? - Furio, it's not normal! - Shh! Okay? It's not normal. It's not normal for you to say in summer and, "May I sleep with you, it's cold." Uh, I'm cold. It's cold, there's a breeze. I mean, there's all these... these drafts. Don't ask. Let's just say that Furio has way too much love to give. Hey, what's that face? Everything is gonna be fine. SUNSET "Family home?" Really? Nat, you know, some guys are just born luckier than others. So you really think Rebecca is gonna date you for some bullshit you post? So? - Guys, have you seen Vincenzo? - No, why? I don't know, he's been gone for an hour and he left his phone here. Cami. Chill, okay? He's probably just taking some pics of... of gorgeous Amalfi. Furio. Do you see him? No. What do we do? I don't know. You know, I'd forgotten how nice it is to wake up with someone next to you. You know if we wanted... this could be our routine every day. - Just always vacationing? - Hmm. No. But we could see each other not just on weekends, without your son sleeping in the next room over. Vincenzo is independent now. Think about yourself. And us. You want to move in? You see, Irene, ever since I met you, I realized that there's one thing that can still surprise me. Everyday life. Can you imagine, my anxiety used to be just awful. So much worse than you. - Oh, Cami. - Irene, hello. - How are you? - I know you're in Sicily, so I don't want you to worry. But Vinz went out early this morning and he hasn't come back yet. I... No. No. But I can't... Explain it to me, okay? We can't find him. What do you mean you can't find Vincenzo? - I don't know what to do. - Cami, I'm coming. I'm in Amalfi. Vinz! Vincenzo! - Did you see him? - No. - Really no? - What do we do? Let's split up, okay? Yes. - I'll go this way. - Okay. I'll go that way. - I'm not feeling well. - Vinz! Your attention, please. A visually-impaired young man has gone missing. His name is Vincenzo. He has brown hair, and he's wearing a white shirt and dark lenses. Please report to the harbor if you have any information. Vincenzo! Vincenzo. Vincenzo! Vincenzo! - And, well... - Nothing. Not here either. Vincenzo! Oh, sweetie. - Oh, God. - What are you here for? - You had us worried! - What happened with you? Oh, my God, you too? Nothing, guys. Mom, shouldn't you be in Sicily with Lucio? - Yes, he's here looking for you. - And you brought Lucio? - Yeah. - Oh, man. You had me so worried. You know my number by heart, you could have called. God, Cami, I would've figured it out. It might have taken a bit longer, but I could've found it. Here, I brought your phone for you. Yeah. Here. It was supposed to be a surprise. Uh, no. Just let him go, hon. It could... It could make him feel worse. Why is he acting like this? I can't believe that I can't just have a normal goddamn vacation, without everyone I know worrying about me. Jeez, that's the first time ever that you've cursed. Are you sure you're all right? God, Furio. Please not you too. I'm fine, okay? Wish everyone would just stop asking. Man, don't sweat it, you know your mother. She gets up in the morning, reads your horoscope, and if it says "possible setbacks," she, like, full panics. I know and I expect that from my mother, but not from Camilla. No. How can I possibly be with someone who just, uh... whose got an army on the way if I'm gone for ten minutes, you know? Uh, hey, Vinz, uh... So, um, Vince did you know the, uh... the heart of the blue whale can weigh up to 200 kilos? Furio, what are you saying? Nothing. It was a distraction. Please, just careful with the knife. I'm... I'm worried. You're about to get cut... If you tried to do it for me, I'll make you look like this apple, man. Well, it's not nuts. Like, when I met you at first, I needed time to figure how to act with you. She needs time. Why don't you cook dinner for her tonight? We're going out with Hans. Well, you don't always talk shit. Vinz, I have a heart as big as a blue whale. - Therapy, 50 euros. - Here.

Straight ahead. - Straight ahead? Then no turn? - No... No turn. A little right. - A little left. - Okay. You're just good. Watch out for the traffic light! - Be serious, okay? - No, dude, I'm being serious. All right then, let's speed up so I can catch someone. Who are you gonna chase, Vinz? ♪ Gonna send them up in flames ♪ I'd like to make a toast to this lovely group of friends. Cheers! Vinz, to your twenties. And to yours which you're still living. You're not getting away with that. I want a speech. Okay, well, here's to, uh... To all the trains you catch by chance that take you to unexpected places. Wow. - Cheers to you! - Cheers! And to the trains you got off at the wrong station. And I'd also like to make a toast to Furio because finally, Rebecca has agreed to see him. - Fabulous! - Ah? Are you joking? No. I invited her to dinner and she said yes. - Can you hold this for a second? - Well, yeah. Whoo-hohoo! Whoa! - Did he dive in? - Yeah. Oh, thank God! That's right, Furio! Come out! What's up with Hans? Hm? I saw you guys next to the hot tub this morning. - Did you kiss? - Yeah. But it was a kiss where like, you know, it happens after drinking on a fun night. It clearly means nothing to him, so... Furio. Tell the truth. From one to five stars, what do I rate? I don't know. One to five stars? You're not a hotel, Furio. Okay, but looking at me, would you think... "Sexy, I'd ride him all night," "Cute, I can't wait to have him meet my grandma," or "What can I say to get the hell out of here?" Furio, listen, okay? Just breathe. - Well, which is it? - Breathe. Let me tell you something. That whistle was very cool. - For real? - No, it was gross. But... but it was cute how much you cared for it. It's your lucky charm. And it's a shame you took it off for someone who, let's just be real, doesn't care about you at all. You are so bitter that you're giving me an ulcer. - See you later then. - See ya. - Cheers. - Touch glasses. Thanks. Thank you. Excuse me. Um, I ordered a pizza with... with pepperoni. Miss, that's what those are. Hm. - He's right. Um... - Yeah? Mm-hm. Those are pepperoni. - For you, "pepperoni" is "salami", right? - Yeah. Oh, well, here, they're those. - They're good. Yeah. - Yeah? So, it's nothing as I was saying... last summer, we did Greece. On... on my yacht. And I invited my, my friend Giorgo. Giorgo who? Uh... Armani. Furio, too far fetch. That's, uh... Well, call him then. - Uh, now? - Yeah. Yeah, do it. Why don't you call him? I heard he's here on vacation, and he's your friend. - Maybe we can all go into his pool... - Yes. Please do it. ...and go swimming, huh? Oh. His pool. Uh, I mean. You know what's it like. He's King Giorgo. He's got catwalks that stuff all around the world. Oh, yeah? Right now, he's probably... Well, he's probably eating or sleeping, and... - My phone's dead. - Oh, yeah. - It's dead? - Oh, yeah, it's off. It's off? Pity. Oh. That's right, it's off. Yes, love? Honey, no. - Okay. You guys are all... - Furio. - Come on. - I mean, I get it. That was way too much. Ridiculous. Guys, I have to go now. - Already? - Yeah. Honey? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, thanks. No appetizers. - Wait. - Bye, honey. You have another dinner now? Yeah, tonight, I had two to squeeze in. All right. You guys, see ya. - Later. - Bye. See ya. - See ya. - Later. - Hang on? See ya? Are you... - Don't call her. Rebecca! Excuse me. Rebecca. Rebecca. Uh, no. Uh, sorry. I... I just... I wanted to say... Well, tomorrow morning, we're biking to the, uh, to the fiord and that's where you gonna see the most spectacular sunset on the coast. So I was wondering if you'd like to... - Tomorrow morning at sunset? - Uh, no, my bad. The morning we can, uh, watch the sunrise. Listen, would you mind just, uh, paying for my sushi? I, uh... Oh, pay you're... Sure, that's fine. Thanks. - See you. - See you. Screw that. Forty-five minutes. What? The time it took her to know me and dump me. I have to go too, you guys. - What? - Come on. It's a friend's birthday I forgot about. Meet me at midnight at the main square? - Okay. - See you then. I may not be as attractive as Hans, but I'm more reliable, right? What are you doing here? Nat, I'm clearly clueless with girls, all right? But I know a thing or two about guys. He's not it. - This vacation is bullshit. - Yeah. All right, so, we'll go shopping for a little bit, and we can meet up as soon as you're back. Okay. Bye, babe. Okay. Nice outfit. - In case, she shows up. - Furio. Don't hold your breath, she's friends with Hans, dude. - Yeah. - Okay. Wanna go? We should go to that little restaurant. - Oh, yeah. - The one we passed by. Girls. Am I hallucinating or you see her too? Yeah, we see her too. Nat, you have to come with us, I'm begging you. Come with us. I, I need someone to laugh at my jokes. Nat. Nat. Please, girl. I'm... I'll pay you. - You'll pay me? - I'll pay you. Mm-mm. Let's go biking. - No, come on. - Come on. Cami. Hans said we're going to an amazing spot. It's beautiful. Come on. What's wrong? It's just Vincenzo wanted to catch up with us. So what? So Vincenzo can't exactly ride. So you can't do it either then. - I mean, we don't even have bikes. - Hans, do you have extra bikes? Hey. Oh, sure. - Hey, Rebecca. - Hi, Furio. Uh, for the two of you? Oh. Yeah. Yes, apparently.

It's also strange to be all together. Mm. I need the restroom. Why did you leave us? I couldn't make it, Vinz. I was so afraid of being a terrible father that in the end, I wasn't a father at all. You know I'm afraid too sometimes, but that doesn't mean that I quit. And when... when I do care about something, I always give it a hundred percent and I put everything into achieving it. For me, there's never a plan B. You don't know how much I missed you. It was so hard. I'm sure. No, I honestly don't feel like you are, Dad. Oh, wow, did you use one of those apps to, like, transform? No. No. I went down 20 kilos in three months. Well, uh, I thought it would make my life better a little. But it didn't at all. And maybe before only one guy would look at me out of a thousand, but... he liked me for who I was. For the full package. Now everyone looks at me, sure, yeah... But only because now I'm cute, and they don't think about it really. Just like my ex. What did your ex do? He cheated and left. Let's go there. But the past remains. Look, you're not the only one who wants to hide. Well, sure you were a little chubbier. Mm. But I imagine that you were less bitchy also. Do you have her number? I might, uh... Mm... Ah. Come on. Don't ever do that again. Better. Hi there. Oh, come, please. Their wines are amazing. Don't... Really, this place is stupendous. Ah... - Ravello 2013. - Oh. Ah! Wait! I'll drink that! Listen, I'm still with my friends. Uh, I'll see you later, okay? All right, Lucio. See you. Let's go. Hey, Cami. This weekend I'm going sailing with my father. You'll come too, right? Anyway, I'm about done here, and we'll head back to the house soon. You almost done shopping? Hi, babe. Oh, that's great. Yeah, we'll... we'll talk about it later. Uh, well, actually here, I don't know. We're running behind a little bit. Um, just Nat tried like, 7,000 dresses, and, um... she doesn't really like anything. It's a bit of a mess, and we're kinda far away. So, it's better if we just meet up later around at home. What do you think? A smooch. Furio! Hurry up! - Come on! - Right, hurry up, easy peasy, Cami. Do you wanna take a picture? Yeah, sure. If you want, we can stand right here, - so the lights... - Uh, it's just me. - Ah, you want me to... - Yes. Sure, of course. Take a step back. And get the bridge in it. Yeah, but vertical or else, I can't post it. Rebecca, the bridge is horizontal, if I take it vertically... So lay on the ground. - Oh, you want... - Uh-huh. - Sure. - Okay. You look fantastic. Look. This sucks, Furio. I can't even post this. Then take it yourself. Sorry, what did you say? You take it, if you don't like mine, take one yourself. What's your problem? Huh? Plenty. The biggest one is I always fall for bitchy girls. It's not your fault. I mean, it's my issue, really. I did everything I could to impress you. Look at the shit I'm wearing. Loafers? I've never even worn loafers in my life, and we're biking! All that for a total bitch, come on! - I'm done. - Hey. - Just leave me alone. - Anyway, just post the photo, it's nice. I mean... Furio, what are you doing? I said don't mess it up with her. It's her party tomorrow. Furio finally grows a pair, and you're worried about the party? Yeah. Okay. I see. What you care about. You only care about yourself. Nat, look, I can't fix your issues, all right? Maybe that kiss meant more to you than me. What can I do? Honey? Lucio? God. Yeah! You missed a real... Just a lovely day. It is probably better if you weren't there 'cause... Silly... I haven't drunk that much since my bachelorette party. My head is spinning like a... But I didn't do it alone. Also, Roberto and Vincenzo were drinking and laughing and, uh... Sweetie, say something. Lucio? ♪ Just stay together ♪ ♪ We're in this forever ♪ ♪ When we're caught in the middle ♪ ♪ And your heart won't settle ♪ ♪ My love won't fade away ♪ ♪ 'Cause my love is like an ocean ♪ ♪ My love, my love is like an ocean ♪ Furio? What? Did Rebecca blow you off? What, you can tell someone's mood by the way they sit down? Give me your sunglasses, I'll take you for a walk. - No, Vinz, I don't feel like it. - Trust me, dude. Well, first, let me go put on something else. - I feel like a moron dressed like this. - Uh-huh. Hey, hey, hey! Watch where you're stepping, sparky! We're sorry. - Wait, What? - I don't know. Anyway, I'm taking off this tape, I'm freaking... - No, no, no. Leave it alone. - See what happened? Put your sunglasses back on. Stay close and you won't bang into anything, I swear. Just concentrate on everything else, it's not hard. What do you mean everything else, Vinz? Oh, god, Furio, listen. As long as I've known you, you've been obsessed with not being able to find the right girl. You think she doesn't exist or you think that you are a loser. - It's a fact, dude. I'm not like... - Okay, okay. But how are you looking for her? How should I, dude? Like everyone else. That's the point, you're searching for someone you want to look at. - And I'd show you... - You should focus on your other senses, the ones that aren't quite as obvious. Your way hasn't worked out so far, right? - Man, do I have to? - Ah, come on. Watch it, dude. Come on, just relax. I'll be there in two minutes. Listen. What does that girl's voice tell you? - Huh? - What girl? You're not getting it. A girl with a gorgeous voice just passed by, and you're not getting it. Do you have any idea what you can learn from a girl's tone of voice? No. It's a wealth of knowledge. If she stammers, maybe she's insecure. You can tell if she's happy or she's sad. And her intonation will tell you if she's reliable. And if she can say what she feels without having to look for the right words. Sure, yes, dude. It's all very poetic, but you have this talent, I don't. - That's not true, you have it too, man. - Hey, guys. - Hello. - Hi. And a little kiss. Oh, and tell Camilla she can use the bike for the whole time you're on vacation, okay? - The bike? - Yes, the bike. The one she borrowed to go on the hike with the guys. What bike? Yes, but it was something we couldn't have done together, anyway. What did that matter? Well, because I knew it would make you feel bad. Okay, you could have told me though. I mean tell me, dammit. Because today, it's the bike, tomorrow it's another thing and where does it end? Do we need to lie to each other? Okay, you're right. I could have told you. But you always pretend everything's normal, and you don't wanna be a burden. But everything's not normal. Sorry. If this is gonna work, we have to be honest. You're right. We do have to be honest. One of my college professors asked me to work, as his assistant. Doing research. But I'd have to stay another year in Canada. I swear, I wanted to tell you, and I tried so many times. But you were so happy about the job your mom got you, and you had planned all of it out. But you forgot to ask me one important thing. What I thought about it. Do you want no strings at this point or what? Something without sacrifices and without... It's like you've been trying to say since you got here. From a distance we were fine, but now... Uh... I just don't want everything planned out already. Us old, I can't picture that yet. I don't want to know where we'll be or what we'll be doing. Because that would mean that... that we wouldn't have lived for a minute. That we lived a life that was pre-established, and I don't... I don't want my life to be like that. And I hate setbacks, you know that. When they happened, I totally lose it. But at least, they force you to change direction and ask yourself what you really want. Do you really want this? Is it really the apartment that's scaring you? Why don't you tell the truth? And admit I'm why you're scared. "You know what I think? You're being unfair. I haven't kissed anyone in months because I can't trust..." No. "You know that night I... I opened up my heart to you. You treat everything like a game." That's it. "You treat everything like a game, but it's not. And I wanted to tell you that." What did you want to tell him? Uh, no, nothing. I... I was looking for... for Hans. - He'll be here later. - Okay. But come on inside, I'll fix you a coffee. Okay. Be careful. I may be German, but I still make coffee better than the Neapolitans do. Ah, yeah. It's missing a piece. He looked happy. Yes, it was his girlfriend from a long time ago, I mean... Thanks. They met at a party on the beach. And the month after, they moved to Berlin together. No one could stop them. Hans, well, his eyes, were lit up with a joy like I had never seen. But one day, he woke up and she was gone. Her stuff was there but she wasn't. And why did she do it? Well, they thought that the summer magic would become part of their daily lives. But that's not how it went. And from that point on, Hans never let anyone enter his world. He's always saying that summer is a scam. That it makes you see things with rose-colored lenses. But, hey. My marriage was sparked by a summer fling. It's just that we were lucky. And our summer's still going. Twenty years later. Have you ever felt like you are at a crossroads, and didn't know which way to go? Because that's exactly how I'm feeling with Camilla. Well, that's what's happening with your mother and me. We were headed to Sicily. She was anxious. So I took a detour and headed for Amalfi. I wanted to ask her to marry me. - You wanna marry my mother? - Yes. And I wanted to do it here. Because I wanted her to share the moment with you. Ah... That's... Enough talking about old people's love drama. Let's talk about you. Why won't anyone just trust me? Oh, my god. I understand more than you think. You have so many dreams, huh. I had plenty at your age too. And I had to give up on a lot of them too. Really be there for Vincenzo, but he's my son, I have no choice. It's different for you. Living with Vincenzo will be a difficult road to take. Choosing a life with someone who can't see, well... Not many people could handle it. I know, but I'm really not sure if I'm one of them. Vincenzo suffered enough when his father left us years ago. If you decided to stay with him, and then... ...for whatever reason you had to take a step back that's something he wouldn't be able to take. And you're risking having that regret forever. Let go of your fears and your doubts, you'll be fine. If Vincenzo feels like you don't trust him, you won't get anywhere at all. God, I know when it comes to that. I'm an awful example. My excuses is I'm his mom, huh. But if there's no trust between you two, everything else will crumble. Mm. - Uh, Vincenzo. - Lucio. He says they're going diving together. They're going diving? Whoo-hoo! So cool! This is so freaking cool! Amazing! Whoa! Come on. Great. Buckle this. - Okay. - One and two... there. Okay. If only Mom could see me... If only she could see me. Okay, so, the regulator... Here it is. Give me your hand. Here. Like that. So, just make sure that you always hold on to it. - Ah. - Never let it go. - Like this? - Exactly like that. Great. All right. - Are you relaxed? - Yeah. Okay. Yeah, but how deep is it? About eight to ten meters. Ah. And just... remember what we said. Backflip, we slip into the water, and then, nothing can go wrong from there. - Okay. - Okay? So, in reality. It's not just what your mother is feeling. Any sensible person would consider the thing that we're about to do, to be... Well, something pretty dangerous. Well, that's what I want to do. Are you ready? Yeah. Mask up. - Okay. - Great. On three, okay? Ready? One, two, and three. That was beyond amazing. I swear. At one point, the silence was incredible. I could feel the pressure of the ocean. I felt the... the temperature, the water going down. It was crazy. - And no fear? - None. No fear at all. Vincenzo! - Sweetie. - Ah... Oh. Are you all right? - Huh? - I'm amazing. That was one of the greatest things I've ever done. Awesome. I swear. I've been anxious all day. How could you even think about taking Vincenzo diving? Mom, don't start. Come on. Everything was fine, just relax. You did this knowing how much I worry. Everything went great. I just want him to have a new experience. Vincenzo is not your son. It's not your place to decide what's good for him. In fact, no one here should be deciding what's right for him. Whatever. We'll talk later. It's irresponsible of you. - You scared her for no reason. - You too, Dad? Come on, we were super careful. And, sorry, but if I wanted to take a risk just one time, what's the problem? Really? Yes, but not if it upsets the one's who love you, Vincenzo. - Lucio chose for everyone. - No, I decided it, okay? I don't need anyone to make my decisions for me. Just like I don't need a pair of glasses to remind me every day what I'm missing. You've never accepted the fact that I'm blind. And your gifts do nothing but remind me. Hi, Cami. Today was really special for me. Because I realized the importance of freedom and doing what you want without worrying about being a burden to others. I know how important that job is for you which is why I want you to do it. Because I know after that there's so much else that you want to do and... Well, I'd only be in the way of all of that. At the end of the day, I'll be fine. I always find a way to do everything I have to do. Plus, I'm used to slamming into things that hurt, you know. I am the absolute worst at relationships. You know it, all my relationships end badly. Like, always. But yours... yours can have a different ending. - Yeah. - You could save it. With 20,000 kilometers of distance? How long does it take to go away? I did everything I could with Camilla, it wasn't enough. How do I find another girl like her? Are you listening, Furio? Vinz, what can I say? What do you think I know about relationships? I mean, do I ask you for advice about driving or getting a license? No. So why are you asking me for love advice? All I know is that if you add up all the time that you guys spent together, it wouldn't be more than a month, it's not much. Time... For me, it's a lot. I'd pay for a month-long relationship. But for someone normal, it's not much. Just give it time. Let her get to know you without all the pressure and stress, without the plans. Vinz, you get upset when someone is worried when you jump off a cliff or you don't answer your phone. I wish I had someone who worried about every dumbass thing I did. You're fortunate. Can I have some time alone, Furio? Oh. Thanks. Miss, you okay? Yes, I'm okay, thanks. Don't make me worry, you're my niece's age. What are you doing here all alone? And you? Uh, miss, Amalfi is illuminated by me. I've been an electrician for 50 years. But I guess even being an electrician is not enough to make your smile light up. - Hey. Hi. - Hey. Hi.

But at least, as far as I'm concerned, surprisingly, I wasn't noticed at all. Mm. No, you know what the real surprise would be, Furio? - What? - You eating that shrimp like a normal person. - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. I know, I'm late. I'll work an extra hour, I'll clean the kitchen. You tell me. I don't know, I'm so sorry. Please don't look at me like that. I know you're angry. - Go on. Go serve the tables. - Thank you. So, guys. How was it? Everything good? Would you like another? Are you all right? Hang on, wait, let me guess. You bite your nails when you lie. You make a ton of jokes that people don't get. And you have a goldfish - that you keep as a pet, don't you? - What? Nothing. It's... Those are my friend's superpowers. I don't have them... Ah... Hey... - Shit. I, I made a... Maybe... - It's okay. - It's all good. - Don't... You totally got that stuff wrong. But if you want to, you can try again. I'm Anna. Furio. So I... Well... Hey. I know it's late, but I thought a lot about it. Would you meet me at midnight at the main square? Please. I'll wait for you. Hey, I didn't touch anything, okay? What? - Oh, god. - I think I'd blown the fuse - in the cellar. - Yes, it's out. Don't fall down the stairs. - You're not coming? - No. I think you should go with him, it's pitch-black. All right, fine. I don't want it... Hey, come light the way. Hey, wait for me! My god, I'm anxious about it. No, it's nothing. What's going on? - Vinz. - Cami? Are all the lights out? And guess who did it? Now we're even. I wanna prove that I trust you. - Come on. - Where? Where I went biking with the others. Okay, but you said before that the road is dangerous. I know. Let's go. Can I have my half? How did you find me? I have my sources. A curly-haired, quirky guy? Okay, careful, just walk slow and steadily. Shouldn't you be at that party? Yeah. But I'm starting to realize what's important to me. Oh. - Careful, it's narrower, here. - Mm-hm. Listen to the sea. What are you doing? I love you, Cami. I love you. Actually, I love you more. No way. - I love you more. - No. Yes. Because it's not so much a question - as length with your tongue, but... - Furio. What are you doing? Hi, Mom. Would you believe me if I said there's one thing you don't know about me? Sometimes, in order to collect memories, I record short audio clips, then I play them back when I want to. You never realize when I'm stealing your voice. So there, now you know pretty much everything about me. Have you ever felt like you are at a crossroads, and didn't know which way to go? Because that's exactly how I'm feeling with Camilla. Well, that's what's happening with your mother and me. We were headed to Sicily. She was anxious. So I took a detour and headed for Amalfi. I wanted to ask her to marry me. - You wanna marry my mother? - Yes. And I wanted to do it here. Because I wanted her to share the moment with you. Oh, one last thing. I'm useless when it comes to relationships too. But that doesn't mean that we're wrong. And I'm not particularly great at giving advice either, in fact, giving it to you now is an insane amount of responsibility. But I have the feeling that you've been looking for any random excuse not to begin a new life because it's scary doing new things. And it's not because of Dad, it's just that what you have with Lucio seems like such a huge thing. You're searching for a reason not to go for it. That's why you're looking back to see what you left behind, instead of being open to the magnificent possibility of what could lie ahead. I love you, Mom. I'M GOING HOME, I'M LEAVING YOU THE CAR. I'LL MAKE DO. LUCIO. - Irene. - Ah. Roberto. Do you know what time the next ferry leaves for Amalfi? I don't know. Listen, why don't you come up with us to Capri next weekend? You, me, and Vincenzo. Yes, but... Roberto, you can't just show up and ruin everything. I'm not saying I never thought about giving us a second chance, but... But I'm not going back now. It's the past, and that's where it should remain. You can't just erase ten years in one week like that. Hm. You know what? I always thought I wasn't enough. That I couldn't make you happy enough. But someone came into my life and I've realized, I'm not that bad. And that the problem isn't always me. That as a team, we could always find a solution. And maybe at 50, I can still find joy.

Lucio... - You can't get on without a ticket. - Let me through, I said. Lucio! Lucio, honey, Lucio. Oh, god! This morning, when I woke up and you weren't there, well, I... How did you phrase it? I wish that waking up together... was our routine every day. I do too. - Ma'am. - Oh, god, my love. - Ma'am! - Yeah? You have to come with me now. Uh, don't worry, I'll... I'll handle it. - Ma'am. - Ah! I have to ask you kindly please... get off the ship right now. Oh, god, stop it, stop it. - There's a step. - I know. Shouldn't we have gotten dressed? Yeah.

There's a rock on there. Okay. Come on, come on, come on! You can do it, straight ahead. You got this, all right? Come on. What do you mean, Canada? Uh, yeah. It's all right. There'll just be some water between us. Some water? - When are you coming back? - God, Mom, I don't know. We'll see. Oh, honey, by the way, this time no detours. Vancouver's freezing. Well, I'm just... I'm very happy for them, okay? Oh, really? I'm happy for you, yes, and that... Sorry, I'm not feeling very well. - She's gonna faint. - Oh. There she goes. - All right. - Oh, boy, here we go again. No, guys, someone's gonna give her the Heimlich maneuver.
