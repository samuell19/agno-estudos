If you're thinking in terms of an alliance, forget it Her marriage is fixed I just wanted to know- It's so obvious when uncultured people like you come to talk Hey! It's not a proposal My son wanted a chic chick simply for time pass! May be go for a movie or drive around in the car Won't I get refined girls from a good family to marry my son? Poor aunty! Misunderstood me completely Ruined it! Marry a girl with a bloody face like that? Why did you mess it up? How will I not be angry? Her mother is so damn arrogant!

Nothing like that But there was a girl in my life And? What else? She just left me That is how a girl's heart is Like water It just flows on and on Men are like mobiles If mobile falls into water or water falls on the mobile... ...the mobile gets spoilt Even God can't predict when an auto will turn! Or when a girl will change her mind Sometimes it may even change on the way to the altar No heart Girls don't have a heart Have you ever heard of a girl dying of a heart attack? Not at all Some men belong to the imbecile clan He won't touch a girl claiming she's a Goddess In the end when some software engineer marries her... ...he'll sit and moan What is the use? That's why you must get to taste the goodies- I'll punch you hard Only a thought Men who got jilted advise their friends like this Let me ask you something We gave our hearts Should we give our body too? Are they entitled to it? That was superb I like it, partner We men love- Stop it, I say Love, bull and bunkum Don't you have any other topic? Don't say that, partner Love is- What is it?
