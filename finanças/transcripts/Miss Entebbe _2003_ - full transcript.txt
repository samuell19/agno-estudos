Go. Jump! Dad! What is this? What's so funny? What? You're crazy. What kind of game is this? You ruined my car. No way. Dream on. "What a carnival, "don't miss out on it..." Clutch, clutch. - I know. Steering wheel. Brakes, brakes, brakes! Asa, be careful. How are you? Look what I found in the garbage. What is it? Did you show Dad? - No. Where's Yoav? - Upstairs. Did you think about what we discussed? About what? About what we discussed. Yes. And? OK. Come here. Come here! Did you think I wouldn't find your report card? Then why did you take her? - What was I supposed to do? Say no? I'm not talking about that. - Then what are you talking about? If I tell her no and you... - Do we have any soup crackers? No, we don't. Nurit, you're overreacting. What's the big deal? Don't tell me I'm overreacting. What will she think of me if you do the opposite of everything I say? - OK. What do you think you're doing? Noa! Dad, tell her, that's my favorite shirt. You can't wear this anymore. - You'll throw out the whole house! I'm serious, it looks like a rag. I said stop it. Let her wear whatever she wants. Here, wear whatever you want. Nush, sit down, your soup's getting cold. That's the last time you're driving your father's car. You hear? Soup crackers. Why do you give her such a hard time? It's my fault? - Do me a favor. Don't you think she feels it? - Stop yelling, OK? I'll yell as much as I want. - Go ahead. Let everybody hear. You bastard. Have you calmed down? I'll calm down after you get the hell out of here. Oh, really? Is that what you want? No problem. I'll just get the hell out of here. When you were a little girl, you took your parents? concern for granted. It never occurred to you that things could be different. But when you're 12 or 13, this attitude goes through a change. Suddenly you become critical of your mother. Suddenly she's not so modern, you think her hairdo is hideous, some of her habits really annoy you and one day you may astoundingly ask yourself: Don't I love my mother anymore? Noa. Noa. Noa, open up. What do you want? - To talk. I'll talk to you when you stop fighting with us. Noa, open up. Come on. Nushnush! Tell her to come down, she'll miss her flight. Can I talk to you for a second? Can I? Hey! Dad said you should come down. Come help me. Will you be spending this week together? Why? I want to know if I should be worried about my house. No you don't, you just want us to be with Danny. Next year you're going to be in the same class. Why? Why? Why? Why? Because in junior high you'll need something like this. Nushnush! - C'mon, he's waiting. Look how pretty you are. It's OK if you don't want to wear any makeup. I'll teach you something. Repeat after me. "Petit fou". What? - Say it. "Petit fou". It makes your face look chic. Come on. "Petit fou". - Right. It's OK. We'll play with Danny anyway. Hello. - Hello. Mom, he said you'll miss your flight. Aren't you coming? Come on, he's waiting for me. Why are you doing this to me? It's only for 4 days. We already discussed it and it's my last convention this year. Go downstairs to Nurit if you need anything, OK? What about Noa? Why don't you invite her over? Mom, stop it. What's the matter? Why not? - Stop it. There's lots of food in the fridge, OK? Now be nice and say goodbye to me. Come on. Bye. Sorry. - No, it's OK. Don't forget what you promised me. Hi. - Hey, Noa. How's your report card? What did Mom say? I still haven't shown it to her. Nayim... This kid will drive me crazy. (Arabic) I saw you! I saw you! - Great, fatso. Here are some clothes of mine for your wife. Thank you. Mom's looking for you. Great, dickhead. - Go squeal on us. Shut up. - Does she give you a prize every time you squeal on us? Is your mom any better? That Arab-lover? What did you say? I said your Mom sleeps with all the poor Arabs. You bitch! I'll show you! - Shut your mouth. Your brother is such an idiot. Forget him. I hate this house, I'll never live here. Why are you sad? You don't understand. - Just ignore him. This is the Voice of Israel and here is a special news bulletin. Terrorists took over a plane... Cut it out. Cut it out, you baby. Terrorists took over Air France flight 139 from Tel Aviv to Paris and demanded to reroute from Paris to an unknown destination. The exact position of the plane remains unknown and where it is heading. We'll keep you updated as more details come in. There are 246 passengers on the Airbus plane, including a baby and four crew members. Danny. Danny? What are you doing here? - Danny, are you here? What are you doing here? Who said you could come into my house? Haven't you ever heard of knocking? Terrorists hijacked your mom's plane. Good evening. We'll start with the hijacked plane story. An Air France flight en route from Tel Aviv to Paris was hijacked today after taking off from a stopover in Athens. Radio contact with the aircraft was lost after the captain announced that terrorists had taken over the plane and ordered him to redirect the flight to an unknown destination. Ben Gurion Airport is on emergency alert and the Foreign Ministry has set up a special situation room. Prime Minister Rabin convened an urgent security consultation announcing that the Israeli government sees the hijackers responsible... Yoav says they're going to kill her. What? They're not killing anyone. Within a day, the whole thing will be over. How do you know? - What? - How do you know? There is no way we will negotiate with the murderers, we will meet them only on the battlefield. Dad, when you were taken prisoner... - Yoavi, not now. Mom! - Asa, I'm warning you. Dad, do you think they'll kill them? - They're not killing anyone. If they do, I don't envy the Libyans. ... The terrorists may demand the release of Kozo Okamoto who is responsible for the murder of Israelis at Ben Gurion Airport several years ago. I have to call my grandpa. Danny! It's OK. It's OK. Mom. Come on, Danny. Why don't you stay at our house? He wants to be at his house. Right, Danny? But I made a bed for him at our house. It's OK, me and Yoav will stay with him. Noa, why don't you come to our house? The government is handling it. And the army. With Yoav and Noa. Friends from the building. Alright. We'll keep in touch. Alright. Bye. My grandpa was crying. Rabin's planning something, I'm telling you. How do you know? From my dad. How does he know? He's in the "Mossad". Of course. Did you think he's just a driving instructor? Do you know what a cover story is? It's 7:08, let's go to our Tel Aviv correspondent for an update on the hijacked plane in Entebbe. The Air France plane at Entebbe Airport is surrounded by Ugandan troops. Come on kid. Come on! Those following the plane's route were surprised when it landed in Uganda after leaving Benghazi Airport last night at 10 PM... Am I passing the test or not? - Don't worry. Do you promise? Bye. - Bye. Ruthie, regards to your father. Don't wear these shorts to your driving test tomorrow. Bye. - Bye. Dad? Good morning. Are you leaving home? What? I want to know if you're leaving home. Where to? Good morning. Nush, we have to go. Are you leaving, yes or no? Don't be silly, OK? Start the engine. Nush, we have to go. Come on! What happened? - Nothing. Are you crying? Get off my back. I don't believe it. Is that your shirt? How did he get it? How? My mom. Watch this. Good morning. You happen to be wearing our friend's shirt. Would you give it back? It's hers, she needs it. Do you speak Hebrew? OK. You can forget about the radio till you give back her shirt. Look what you've done. - Me? It's your shirt. Did I tell you to push him? - I didn't, he slipped. You broke... - He's bleeding. He's faking. We should call an ambulance. - Yeah, right, and let them go straight to our parents? They'll accuse us of doing it on purpose. Let's do it. - Do what? Let's take him. - Where to? She's just kidding. - No, really. Let's keep him. What for? We can say we kidnapped an Arab kid, and that if anything happens to your mom, we'll kill him too. His dad is coming. Grab him, Danny! - Dad! Dad! - Shut up. Dad! Dad! Don't smile. - Once more. Come on! "Nurit Krauss - CV" Do me a favor, Nushi, my pills are in the drawer, give me one. Got a headache? Mr. Abraham. Maybe you saw. You've been here for awhile? What's the problem? - My son Nayim, a little boy, I went to put the garbage cans back and he disappeared. You can't find your boy? - No. Did you look for him real good? - Real good. Please help me, Mr. Abraham. Did you look for him at home? - It's faraway, we live in Silwan. What should we do with him? - Take him around in the car. I have lesson in a little while. - Oh. OK, forget it. Listen, buddy, I think you're overreacting. Go home, I bet he's already there, OK? Come on. Come on. "Dear Mr. Hayim Yavin, the newscaster. "We kidnapped an Arab, we're holding him hostage. "We want you to say on the news today "so that Rabin and all his ministers know "that if anything happens to one of our hostages in Entebbe... "We'll do the same thing to our hostage." "You better take us seriously. "We have a gun and we're not afraid of anything. "We want Rabin to tell the terrorists "that they must return our hostages to Israel safe and sound. "Only then will we release him." Nayim! Nayim! Hey, Nayim! What do you want? Next time call me when you have to go. I brought you cookies. Put them on the table. Where's Danny? - With Yoav. So why are you here? - No reason. How is he? - OK. Did you see Dad? - No. OK. Nushnush... I'm sorry... - Don't call me that way. Want some? Reuters reports that the hostages are unharmed. The French ambassador in Kampala informed us on the phone that the hostages are at the airport and are unharmed. Let's go to our Paris correspondent... Enough, go to sleep. What good will it do them if you keep listening to the radio? I don't like her being there with the boys. Nature gave every girl something beautiful that is just waiting to be given the opportunity to stand out: Hair, skin, eyes and posture, even a certain voice or smile can cause the beholder's heart to palpitate. This is a beauty with an inner charm that glows on the outside. One can reach this kind of inner beauty by reading good books or engaging in art, but mainly by fulfilling the ambition of making others happy. I trust you. The situation remains the same. The night went by safely, yet there is great concern for the wellbeing of the passengers. They are still concentrated in the airport's dining hall surrounded by terrorists armed with guns and grenades. The plane is standing empty at the edge of the runway, booby-trapped with explosives. What does it say in the written announcement given to Entebbe Airport authorities by the hijackers? Do the hijackers know what they are asking for in exchange for the release of the hostages? Noa? Noa! What's going on here? We kind of fell asleep. - You kind of fell asleep? We were up late watching the news and dozed off. What do you do here all the time? Nothing. Nothing? Yeah. It's not that I don't trust you, but you aren't... What? Nothing. What? Nothing. Dad. Nush, I want you to sleep at home tonight. Go downstairs, brush your teeth. Are we really going to meet him? - Of course. What'll we say to him? - Nothing. We'll hand him the letter and run for it. "The Israeli Broadcasting Authority" C'mon. The hijackers have presented an ultimatum... You can't stand here. We'd like to... - We came to speak with Hayim Yavin. Who's "we"? It's about the hijacked plane, we have to give him something urgent. Ami! What? - Come here. What? - They want to meet Hayim Yavin. His mother was hijacked in Entebbe, we have to give him something urgent. Really? Really, your mother? Listen, kid, I understand you're upset, we're all upset, but not just anyone can meet Hayim Yavin. Yoav! Open up, ape-face. What do you want? Open up, I have something important to tell you. What? Dad's Uzi disappeared. Have you seen it? No. Yoav? Dad, he says he doesn't have it. Where's Danny? He went with Noa to get a newspaper. Did Asa tell you? You have no idea where it could be? I think he's lying. Yoav, were you playing with the Uzi? No. They're gonna kill her. No they aren't. If she dies, where will I live? Who will look after me? But I don't want to work night shifts. Let me tell you something... I'm going to inform the union. But I said no night shifts! "Hayim Yavin" Yes. Come in, please. The door is open. OK, I'll call back later. Goodbye. Uda... Hi, what's up? - Hello. Have you seen Nayim? - Who? My son Nayim. I've been looking for him since yesterday. He disappeared. What do you mean? He's been missing since yesterday? Wait, did you look for him real good? Yes. Let's call the police. - No, no. Thank you. Tell me when you find him, OK? Drink, drink. Thank you. Where exactly did you find that? Underneath. What? Downstairs, in the garden. I thought he was mad at me. I thought he ran away. Dad! - Shut up. What are you doing? - Dad, Dad. Shut up. We have to move. - Where to? His father is on to us. Did your dad find the Uzi? - No. Noa's still sleeping? Abraham, he can't find his boy. You still haven't found your son? He said he spoke with you. - And what did we tell him? You still haven't called the police? Abraham, he found the boy's pants in the garden, OK? What does that mean? How should I know? Maybe he's somewhere around here? Where? At my house? What are you talking about? Uda, wait. Why doesn't he go to the police? Why don't you go to the police? Leave him alone, OK? If your daughter disappeared, is that what you'd say? What are you doing? Get out. Pretend like we're friends. Wait. What if the builders are still there? You go ahead, I'll stay with him. I'm gonna kill him. Where is he? How long have you been sleeping? - I don't know. You fat, stupid faggot! - Stop it. You can't watch him for one second? - Stop it! What happened? Stop! Wait! Hey, Nayim! Nayim! Noa. Noa. Ora, have you noticed anything strange going on with the kids? Come on, I'm making coffee. No, I'm asking you seriously. Your imagination is working overtime. Come. What are they doing there all the time? It's that age. They do everything to spite you. Noa. Nayim. Your father is waiting for you. Bye. I'm sorry... This afternoon the hijackers threatened to blow themselves up tomorrow by 2 PM, if their demands aren't met... Prime Minister Rabin convened the cabinet for urgent consultations. They announced that the government will not negotiate with the terrorists... The 106 Israeli hostages are going to endure a rough night at the Entebbe Airport terminal. Their relatives back home in Israel will have a sleepless night too, knowing that tomorrow at 2 PM the ultimatum given to the Israeli government will expire... Where did you find him? Family members held a stormy protest in front of the Prime Minister's residence... We don't need that. They called out against Rabin, accusing him of disregarding their relatives? lives. Let's go to him. - To whom? To Rabin. Tomorrow morning, before the ultimatum expires. Do you think they're looking for us? I don't think so. There's no one looking for me. At least you won't get in trouble if you get caught. Stop it. Do you think my mom will come back? Is it true your parents are getting a divorce? Where did you hear that? My mom told me. It's none of your business. Sorry. Do you know what'll happen when my mom finds out what we did to this kid? She'll laugh at me. She and Asa will both laugh at me. Yoav's mom! Can you hear me? We're good kids! Good kids! Understand? That's what we are! Good kids! Rabin: Israel regards the governments whose planes fly to and from Israel fully responsible for the passengers? safety. I'm pleased that the French government expressed its stand and I'd like to believe that this will continue to be their policy... Good morning. I said good morning. I don't say good morning to someone who lies to me. Where are you going? I thought you're not speaking to me. - Don't mess with me. Where did you sleep last night? At Danny's. I believe I asked you to sleep at home, right? Nushnush... What's happening with you? You'll know soon. - Know what? You'll see. Good morning. You have to go to Rabin. Why? His dad saw me. Here. Sit down. Here. It's a gift. Do you guys like him too? Rabin! Rabin! Rabin! Rabin! Noa? Nayim? Nayim? - What's this? Want some? Got any brothers? Yeah. And sisters? No. You're only boys? Your dad must be really happy, right? My dad would love to have a boy. I asked him once... why they don't make me a brother. You know what he said? If the contractor went bankrupt, you can sue him, the problem is if he comes back. Look at this place. It'll be OK. Don't worry, it'll be OK. Noa? Mom! Where is that boy, Noa? I want to know what you did with him. What are you doing? Noa, what are you doing? Noa, stop it. It's your fault! Noa, come here! Stop it, stop it! - It's your fault. Calm down this instant, I said calm down. Stop it, stop it, stop it, here... that's enough, stop it, no! Nushnush, listen to me, I want to explain something to you. Noa! Noa! Go. Go. Why aren't you going? Go home, run. C'mon! Go, I said. Go! Noa! What are you doing? Have you gone nuts? Give me that. Stop it! Give me that. - Let go. Enough! - What is wrong with you? Let's go. Dad! Noa! Noa. Noa, what are you doing? Give me that. Say you're sorry. C'mon! Noa, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Not to me. Come here. The Hercules planes landed without any warning at the edge of the runway. They came back and these are the first pictures... This is an unsuccessful attempt to organize this outburst of happiness... Well done! Welcome home! English: Suzy De Lowe Subtitles: Cinematyp Ltd. Subtitles: Cinematyp Ltd.
