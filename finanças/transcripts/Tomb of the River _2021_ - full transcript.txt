Are you going to drink today? Of course I am. I drink 365 days a year. Hey, what is that? Are we expecting another boat? All fishing boats have returned. Then, what boat is that? Oh, my legs... Jae-bok. It's not answering the radio. What? Excuse me? Is anyone here? Is it a boat from China? What is this smell? Does it smell? Why doesn't this boat have any working equipment? Is it a smuggling boat? What the hell... This is messed up. Huh? Who the hell are you? Did you kill him? He must have... Eaten him. Sir, I'm calling stop. Damn it! You ruin everything, Gil-suk. You shouldn't take your henchman's money. Shut up. Why are you here? I need to use an excavator. An excavator? Why? One of our boys called Duk-gu is getting married. We're throwing him a party. Here, just take it. Yes, sir. Bo-ram, I love you! Once we're married, I'll never cheat on you! Even if they take me to a room salon... Hey! Raise your voice! I can't hear you! Come on! Bo-ram! I'll never love anyone else! Stop laughing! Lower him. You're doing great, Duk-gu! Are you sure he'll survive that? People don't die that easily. That's enough. We still need to beat him. Hey! Duk-gu, not bad! That was impressive! Sir, you should head out. Why? Gather everyone. - Gather everyone. - Yes, sir. Hey! Let's go. The groom shouldn't go anywhere. - Get back in the water. - Yes, sir. Where the hell are you going? They're still in the room. We have the room number. My men were just about to arrest them. Any thoughts? Obviously, I'm really sorry. This is serious. You think this is okay? Of course not. I know that. What the hell... I'll let this one slide, but this is the last time. Message received. You're the police, so go take care of civilians. - You bastard. - We'll handle it, sir. - Get off of me. - You can go now. If I get another report... Damn it. What's wrong, baby? There's nothing there! These kids must be crazy. Who the hell are you? How dare you! Son of a bitch! These damn kids are really using drugs. Don't ruin the city that's about to host the Olympics. Where are they? Sir... - Why are you here? - What the hell? What do you want? Why are so many henchmen here? Hey! Clean up this mess. Lift your glass. Come on. You shouldn't have barged in like that. Stop it. You know you shouldn't be selling drugs. Don't be mad at me. I had no idea. Should I be watching my men's every move? Don't be ridiculous. You're responsible for them. I had to stop the police from arresting them. We should handle it ourselves. - Isn't that right, sir? - Of course it is. Gil-suk is a thoughtful guy. Thoughtful, my ass. Here comes the boss. Hello, sir. There's the groom. - Hello, sir. - Welcome. Why do you have a foreign phone? So, you've been fighting? - No, sir. - Not at all. I heard about everything. In my opinion, your gang did wrong for selling drugs. Your gang also did wrong for interfering. - Gyeongpo Gang. - Yes, sir. If I see drugs in Gangneung again... I'll put a hole through your skull. Yes, sir. - Taekji Gang. - Yes, sir. You're all part of the same family. Don't fight with your little brother. Yes, sir. Listen up. If the Taekji Gang and Gyeongpo Gang fight... I'll blame you, the big brother. Yes, sir. Give me a cigarette. Something I can chew on. Here you go, sir. He's here, sir. How much debt do you have? 7 million won. That's the world for you. Some guys can drink away 7 million over a single night. But some guys die because they don't have 7 million. I'm doing this to survive. I hope you survive, too. Get back to your game. I'm here. - Did you eat? - Yes, I did. When people meet at this hour, they usually eat together. Let's eat, then. Why are you here? I want the shares of the resort in Gangneung. I got you the shares instead of cash. I need it. Shin is taking care of those shares. But they're still yours. I gave you some business when you left the gang. You gave me a debt collecting business. I run around collecting money from your debtors. Your words cut like a knife. I've killed over 10 people for you... You got your hands dirty, so you want a new deal? I've been doing dirty work for over 10 years. It's not too much to ask. You earned a living in return. We gave you money and power. You used to have nothing. This is why I don't like conversation. Conversation never solves anything. Why, you little... What the hell? You're here. Come help me. Are you by yourself again? I told you to hire someone. No one cares about an old fellow like me. You really find this enjoyable? Of course I do. I plant it, grow it, pick it, then eat it. You buy vegetables at the store, don't you? My taste isn't refined enough to know the difference. Do you know what's nice about home-grown vegetables? They're free of chemicals? No, I use a ton of chemicals. That's why they've grown so big. If you buy vegetables, you throw away what's left. Sure. But if you grow them, you give what's left to other people. - Isn't that funny? - I guess you're right. That's how the world works. You should only grow what you need. Then, you'll cherish what's left. That light fixture cost a billion won. The entire thing is made of gold. You put a lot of money into this place. To make something great, you need to put in time or money. I'm putting in both. - Is it solid gold? - No, just the outer plate. Gil-suk... Yes, sir? Do you know what 'Asra' means? It's what Gangneung used to be called, right? Just look at it. It means 'dizzyingly vast'. I'm worried that's the case with this resort, too. Do you want to run the resort? Me, sir? But this resort is in Chung-sub's territory. Sometimes, we have to change our ways. I don't want any more conflict with the Gyeongpo gang, sir. It belongs to all of us, anyway. I'll just manage the Taekji territory. You're soft when it matters the most. To tell you the truth, one of the shareholders is a bit strange. Shall I give him a beating? That's not what I meant. Don't fight. If you fight, you suffer whether you win or lose. How long has it been? Not even an hour. Go back to sleep. Is this where you're staying? Yeah, for a while. It doesn't really suit you. No place does. What brings you here, sir? I happened to be in Gangneung, and I heard you had a new office. Drink. I didn't want to come empty-handed. Gangneung coffee tastes great. I heard about the boss. I was too busy to attend his funeral. You left the gang, so there was no need for that. It's fine. Thank you for saying that. The kid who killed him was in debt. It's strange that he handed over the shares to you. It's only natural to suspect the new shareholder. But who would be this brave? I want to kill or maim the bastard who did it. Then, I'll be able to give the boss a proper send-off. Then... Go do that, instead of just talking about it. Across the rooms, restaurants and hallway there will be a club and a casino. We're trying to get a permit to run the casino. Sir... Stop right there. You can't come in here. Let me finally introduce myself. I'm Lee Min-suk. I know who you are. But what brings you here? I haven't received the updated blueprint. I'd like to see it. Why would you be interested in that? Did you eat? I heard my men's drugs caused problems in your family. They were just trying to earn some cash. I apologize. Are you close to the Gyeongpo Gang? No. I've never met them myself. I see. What's a drug dealer doing all the way out here? If we're going to do business together, I need to know your history. Don't you know the times we're living in? You can't smoke inside an eatery. Have a problem with that? Should I put it out? I do have a problem with that, but knock yourself out. I'm not involved with drugs. I'm a debt collector. I heard you sell off people who can't pay their debts. They need to settle their debts. Even if they don't have the money. Exactly. Why would you choose such a dangerous path? Everything in this world is already owned by someone. So, I have two options. Either kill and steal, or do something too dangerous that others donâ€™t do. That's the only way a guy like me can get by. Hey, I heard you're a mean one. Don't worry, I don't attack just anyone. Is that a knife in your back pocket? I guess you're not used to seeing it. I'm just repulsed. Why do you live like that? Don't waste your energy like this. You won't have enough when you actually need it. Don't be so scared. You were hasty getting a new office. Do you want me to work out on the streets? That's exactly why I'm calling you hasty. You can buy shares in the resort, sure. But you can't interfere in its management. You mean I can't get involved in business. I'm the second largest shareholder. Let me be honest with you. I don't want to work with a bunch of drug dealers. Second largest sharholder, so what? We are the largest shareholder. Unless you buy more shares and take our spot you can't meddle with its management. Isn't that right? Am I being unreasonable? Fine. I guess I should listen to the largest shareholder. Good. I guess it's settled, then. Eat up. Our talk is over, so I'm leaving. Did you chat with them? What were they like? They're so unlikable. Should we kick their asses? Leave them. Their life seems hard, anyways. We shouldn't fight them. Share a meal with them sometime. Yes, sir. Let's drink. Why is there only rabbit food? Where's the meat? - Welcome, sir. - Good to see you. Thanks for coming. Thank you, sir. - Thank you so much. - Grab a seat. Hello, Lieutenant. - I didn't think you'd come. - Of course I came. I thought you were busy. - Who's that? - Thank you for coming. If it isn't Lieutenant Cho, the star detective. How have you been? You're not attending the ceremony, are you? Welcome, sir. - Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. Welcome. What the hell are you doing? Could I ask the same thing? I never imagined you'd do this to me. Sir, we're having a celebration. A celebration, you say? You mean this idiot? Is the boss handing you the resort? He did offer it. And? I refused. I see. Then, why do you keep hanging around the site? Sir, you're going too far. You bastard... Have you lost your mind? What the hell are you doing at my wedding? How can you do this? I starved myself to get into this wedding dress! This is embarrassing. Don't do this. Not today. Here's your wedding gift. Get back to your jobs. If my head moves while I swing, hit me. Yes, sir. You son of a bitch. I didn't mean it, you crazy bastard! I'm sorry, sir. - I'll smash your head in. - I'm so sorry. You bastard. Get that thing out of my face. - I'm so sorry. - Sir. Bring him over here. Get lost. I thought I was meeting with Mr. Kim. Only a president gets to meet with another president. Nice shot! Have you heard of 'Songs of Gwandong'? No. Just as I expected. It's a super old poem. It says that this is the most beautiful place in Gangwon-do. It's the best place to enjoy a drink while looking at the moon. That's the life I want. And that's the life I want for my son. It's heaven on earth. Wow, I should just quit right now! That was amazing! I don't think I need any more practice. Hey... I know our bosses have some business conflict. But let's leave the business up to them and try to get along. I get what you're saying. But that's easier said than done. A man of reason, huh? I know it won't be easy, but we should at least try. I heard you've had a lot of hardship. I understand that. So, just take things easy. You understand the hardship I've had? Did you have it easy? I did some manual labor when I was young. See, I was right. I worked for a month and got my first paycheck. I realized how hard it is to make money. You're right, it is hard. That night, I had dinner with a guy who did manual labor for 30 years. I told him I was amazed. 'How have you been doing this for 30 years?' This is what he said. 'You know nothing.' He doesn't sound like a very nice man. I had degraded him. I'd never been disgusted by people or lost a co-worker in an accident. I'd never been ignored by someone younger than me. I was just a kid. Yet, I claimed to understand his life. It's insulting to tell people you understand them. Hey, do you find that insulting? I don't get what he's saying at all. Pack everything up. Damn it. Don't you dare look at me. Can I get some raw fish? I'll prepare it right away. What an easy life you lead. Why do I sense scorn in your voice? This is no time to be enjoying raw fish. Gil-suk is about to usurp the resort. Well, he's smart and skilled. Hierarchy and territory need to be respected. The boss is passing on his business to us. So, it's up to him to decide. How ridiculous. You're not going to do anything about it, then? Sometimes, things are solved by doing nothing. Damn it... Enjoy your raw fish. I'm leaving. Chung-sub. Don't go out to sea when there's a storm brewing. We never let the weather forecast dictate our lives. You should get some sleep. You look tired. Are you worried about me? Am I not allowed to do that? You're always like that. Whenever I try to get close, you push me away. What are you going to do? How will you settle your debt? You're using your body just to pay off the interest. Don't you need to live? Were you just collecting interest from me? What are we, then? What are we? Tell me. Hmm? Think you can handle me? What brings you here? I was in the area, so I dropped by. I thought you'd like some help. No, thanks. This is a job for someone with experience. It doesn't seem that hard. I guess you're used to getting your hands dirty. You've had it rough. Not as rough as the people that died. There must be a lot of blood on your hands. If you use pens, you get ink. But if you use knives, you get blood. Not anymore. Nowadays, pens get you blood. Knives just get you jail time. You're right. The world has changed for the worse. In the past, if you wanted to eat a chicken you had to strangle it, gut it and pluck its feathers yourself. But nowadays, you just have to go to a supermarket. What a convenient world. But there's something people shouldn't forget. Whenever someone eats a chicken... someone else had to strangle and gut it. People keep themselves busy to forget about that stuff. Have you ever killed someone? Why would you ask me something like that? Gangneung may be a rural town but it's hard to get to the top without killing someone. You seem like such a nice person. If I had killed someone, would that make me the same as you? I'm not sure. That's what I'd like to know. It's simple. A man who killed 100 people isn't the same as a man who killed 1 person. The scope of things always matters. That determines the difference between individuals. Why are you here? I had a talk with Mr. Kim about managing the resort. I heard you two came to an agreement. Is there something else you want to say to me? No, I have nothing else to say. Not bad for a retiree. You've got a long way to go! What would I do with that now? It'll only be pitiful. It's time for you to go. You shouldn't... You bastard. Sir... - Sir, you can't... - Get off of me! - What are you doing? - Let go! You can't go in there! Excuse me! We did our best, but he lost too much blood. I'm sorry, but he passed away. Mr. Kim... What are you doing? You can't be here! Who killed him, you bitch? I'm here because I did it. You need to leave! Get off! You're just a nobody who came out of nowhere! You can't have killed our boss! It's not that hard to kill an old man. You fucking bitch! He was almost 70! Why would you do such a thing? Tell me! Fuck... I did it to survive. I'll do anything to survive. What the fuck! She was in debt. Dongbu Credit was collecting from her. That's Lee Min-suk's company. I understand how you feel. But trust me and be patient. Okay? Just sit around and wait? We need to handle this ourselves, right now! The boss told us not to fight. He's dead now! That's why he died! Hey... Welcome. Kim, you're here. I've heard a lot about you. This is Shin from Chungsong Planning. Chungsong Planning? Didn't Lee Min-suk screw you guys over? President Nam died, right? Kim, come on. Be more tactful. Let's get this over with. You're quite impatient. That's right, so speed it up. All right. Lieutenant Cho is preparing to catch Lee Min-suk. When Lee Min-suk and Dongbu Development are gone you'll need a new investor. Well... That's all business talk. Why is the police getting involved? I think you've misunderstood. No, I understand everything. It's bad enough that you lost. Now, you're asking around for help. That's pathetic. Chief... My boss's grave is still fresh. Kim, don't be so... Mr. Kim, I get what you're trying say. This was rude of me. At least you know. I'll foot the bill. Enjoy your meal. Sir, welcome. Find anything? No, so far we just beat them up. You need to get answers before beating them up. Idiots. Why are they upside down? That causes nausea. Are you nauseous? I meant me. Hold on... We're not used to doing something like this. We can tell. If you're going to beat people up at least explain why, you bastards. I heard your mom has stomach cancer. Did she eat too much spicy food? What the hell... My mom's cancer is none of your fucking business. You son of a bitch! Grab his head. If you touch my mom, I'll kill every single one of you! Her hospital bills must be expensive. Is Lee Min-suk helping you out? We'll pay for her surgery and get her a caretaker. - How's that? - What? Just give us the time and place. That's all we need. Lieutenant, we got the time and place. Gather round. I'll be right there. ((ì¤‘êµ­ì–´)) ((ì¤‘êµ­ì–´)) ((ì¤‘êµ­ì–´)) They're on the move, Lieutenant. What is it? It's started. If Lieutenant Cho fails, I'm going in myself. Okay. Stop drinking. Is it only me who's worried? Damn it... We're being tailed. Lee, the police is following us. We're following Horse, Elephant and Cannon into the marketplace. Chariot, Guard and Soldier are entering through the back gates. Cannon made a turn. We'll follow him. Horse and Elephant are heading to the center of the marketplace. Horse and Elephant split up. We'll follow Horse. Team 7, follow Elephant. Guard split up with Chariot and Soldier. Guard is by himself now. Team 2, follow Guard. Chariot and Soldier split up, too. He's headed for the rendezvous point. He's near the rendezvous point. We got Chariot and Soldier. They're at the rendezvous point. They fell for our trap. Stop right there! Hold it! - Stay still! - We caught all of them! One will have drugs, and the other will have cash. Search every inch. Don't be so rough! That hurts! - Don't move! - Hold still! What's that? Do you like pu-erh tea? Tea? Let me explain. Chinese people love tea. So, I thought I'd let them taste the famous Gangneung coffee. If you want some, you can have it. Think of it as a present. Idiots. Let go of me! Sir, I got the goods. Time for some offense. I knew this would happen. They didn't get Lee Min-suk. - Get ready. - Yes, sir. Let's do this! What are you waiting for? Aren't you coming? What's going on? Chung-sub! Are you serious? - What the hell? - Son of a bitch! You bastards! Take that! Stop acting tough. You look adorable right now. Gil-suk... What's going on? Where are you? I never expected this to happen. Stop talking nonsense. Where are you? Not that I cared about treating you well... But I was such a bastard to you. Gil-suk... I'm sorry. Just answer my damn question! Hey, what are you doing? Gyeongpo? Gyeongpo! Mr. Kim... Damn it... I guess that's it for today. Hyung-geun... Congratulations. It's not really something to be congratulated. What do you mean? You don't even have to give orders. Your henchmen and debtors kill your enemies for you. So, you get cleared of all charges. Isn't that something to be congratulated? Are you here to pick a fight? I know you bought off Choi Mu-sang. I never bought him off. I just asked him a question. 'Do you really want Kim Gil-suk to own the resort?' Do you know where Mr. Kim is? Why do you ask? He's still the largest shareholder. It's difficult to do business without him. If you hear anything, please let me know. Did you gain weight? That's hard to do in prison. You regret it, don't you? If that's all, I'm leaving. Sit your ass back down. Do you think I came here out of boredom? If you admit that you didn't do it I'll take care of everything. Then, what about my debt? I'll introduce you to a lawyer. Declare bankruptcy and get financial aid. Bankruptcy? You think he'll allow that? He'll find me and put me to work. Then, he'll sell my organs. Mister, do you know why I'm still alive? It's because of my beauty. Good for you. So, just leave. Even without your testimony, Lee Min-suk will get arrested. On multiple charges. I'll make him pay for his greed. You think it's greed? What do you mean? Good luck. I'll be rooting for you. This is nice. The East Sea is better than the West Sea. I never took time to enjoy the scenery. If this is where I grew up, would I be any different? Seems like Gangneung suits your taste, sir. It's nice, but people are the same everywhere. Do you own this place, too? Well, I'm a loyal man. I'm even happy to see your face. Maybe all that fighting lead to attachment. Why are you here? To negotiate? To do business. Business, huh? You're too hard to get rid of. So, let's manage the resort together. I'll take the casino. You take the club. The rest, we'll cut up. And share the books. You want to act as if nothing happened? Isn't this what you wanted? Or, do you want another knife fight? Looks like hardship made you weak. Even with a knife, you couldn't kill me properly. Do you want another chance? Most people get scared after being stabbed. But you seem fine. You put a hole in my stomach, so of course I'm scared. But all that hardship made me realize something. You're also scared of me, right? But after what happened, it's hard to trust you. When we first talked, you agreed to back off. If you weren't happy, you should have persuaded me. You tried to get the police to arrest me, too. Talk means nothing. What about this conversation? Does it mean anything? In this world, words are meaningless. Claim that you're in this together, but then eat your friend's heart. That's what humans do. So, stop talking and just do it. Let's wait and see. I heard you met with Lee Min-suk. How the hell do you know that? What are you planning? Nothing much. I want to do business like these bastards from Seoul. You're going to run around with a knife, too? Do you know why I work this hard? After I retire, I want to enjoy a relaxing life here. But I'm going to need a friend. If you run around stabbing people... I won't be able to see you. This is no time for such daydreams. No, it's the perfect time for daydreams. You can't survive in this world without a little romance. Don't be ridiculous. Romance is long dead. It's still alive, you idiot. Gil-suk. I'm the police. I can't make exceptions if you break the law. That's just fine. You do your job, and I'll do mine. Gil-suk! Let me handle it. Don't do this, okay? I trust you. But I don't trust your words. Sit. You make me leave, and then you make me come back. It seems like you can't make up your mind. I heard what happened. Things aren't looking good, right? There's no need to comfort me. Why did you want to see me? I'm going to kill Lee Min-suk. Will you help? Why should I help you? Don't you have unfinished business with him, too? No. You lost, so you're asking around for help. Who would trust you? He killed my boss, yet I did nothing. That wasn't because I'm an idiot. You can't go crazy while dealing with a madman. It's not as simple as paying off the police. In this war, I'll end up doing all the hard work. But I'll only get to be the resort's second largest shareholder. No. I'll let you become the largest shareholder. You take my shares. I'll take Lee's shares. The moment he dies... Mr. Shin, you'll become the largest shareholder. How's that? Mr. Kim... You've never wielded a knife before. Are you sure you can handle it? Sir... Kim Gil-suk gave his shares to Chungsong Planning. They're opening an office here in Gangneung. Should we strike first? You're here. You're working with Chungsong Planning? You just sit on your ass, but you hear everything. I've heard he's not easy to work with, either. Why did you do it? Why, you ask? I guess it was greed. Do you know how I became a gangster? I was just over 20. Some fishermen were auctioning off the squid they had caught overnight. But some guys from Seoul were causing trouble. So, the boss and I beat them all up. And the fishermen thanked us for it. They even treated us to raw fish. That's how I started. For a while, things were fine. But then, trucks belonging to big companies started causing trouble. This time, we couldn't beat them all up. So... We expanded our organization and founded a company. We even made business cards. I worked really hard. And that resort... That big building didn't just appear out of nowhere. It was my dream to build something like that. What do you think? Is it greedy of me to want that? I never thought of it as mine. It's ours. Well, that's the problem. There's no such thing as 'ours'. It's either yours or mine. Can't you... Can't you just apologize? Apologize? You only apologize... After you do something wrong. I've done nothing wrong, so I can't apologize. Gil-suk... Just do me a favor. Don't share it with others. It should be all yours. I won't apologize, either. Bastard! - Son of a bitch! - Stand back. You adjusted pretty fast. Why did you turn this place into hell? I didn't do anything. The world decides these things. People just follow. That's right. That's why we followed, too. Just in time. Lee Min-suk, you're under arrest for conspiracy to murder and drug trafficking. How did you get a warrant? You won't find anything. Arrest him. What the hell! Is this how you've lived all these years? Yes, sir? How did it go? - Things are still developing. - Don't make any mistakes. When Lee Min-suk dies, Kim Gil-suk must die. Don't worry, sir. Everything's going according to plan. Everyone thinks that they deserve more. If we don't get rid of Kim Gil-suk, we'll keep fighting over the shares. Mr. Kim swallowed his pride and asked for your help. He must trust you. What about Lee Min-suk? Did he trust you, too? Let's wrap things up and go to Mr. Kim. You sons of bitches! Bastards! You're so adorable for a tough guy. Wait... Please! If you lock me up, Kim Gil-suk won't have to kill anyone. Things will settle down for a while. But... This war will break out again. You're just making things more bothersome. Lieutenant... What are you doing? - What about you? - This is police business. No warrant was approved. Is that a fake warrant? If you don't stop now, I won't be able to help you. It's too late for any of that. Shut up! If you want to kill him, you'll have to kill us first. Move, you bastard! Care to explain? Go to Seoul. Don't ever come back. Are you asking me to beg for my life? I'm saving your life, even before you beg. You never got a warrant? Are you even listening? Don't go. You'll die if you do. Running away won't change anything. Only death will end things. I don't care about that. I just want to save my friend. You're such an idiot. Your friend is no different. He's approaching me, too. Fuck you! Take that! Are you upset? You don't deserve to be upset. Of course not. I knew that I'd die this way. That triumphant face of yours. It makes me laugh. Kim Gil-suk... You think that you're nothing like me. But remember how I look right now. Sooner or later, you'll die just like this. Are you going to arrest me? My bosses, my brothers and my friends... You did nothing while they all died. But you're going to arrest me? Gil-suk. Is this what you wanted? Will you be able to live this way? What other choice did I have? I told you. Romance is long dead.
