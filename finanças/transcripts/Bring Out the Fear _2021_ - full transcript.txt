[Ominous music] [Monstrous breathing and hissing] [Worried breathing] [Creature moans and cries] [Cracking and ominous creature noises] [Loud creature noise] [Peaceful music] [Humming] Please don't go into that off license, ok? I won't. I don't want you running into... You know... I won't. No alcohol, I know. I'm just going to the shop. Promise? I promise. Relax! [Phone buzzing] Heya. How's it going? Yeah, we're just heading on that walk now. I left a couple of boxes in the spare room if you can pick them up? [Christmas music] Dan... Working hard there, yeah? Mate, what are you doing here? This isn't the place. 'Mate!' That's hilarious! I'm not sure what's going on here, but we can't be having this out okay? Please. What's going on here is this. I want you to look out that window. Sitting in that car right now, waiting for me, is Rosie. I'm sure you remember her, yeah? Dan, come on. What do you want me to say? You know I'm sorry about all that stuff- I don't need to hear any of that. What I want you to know is I'm walking out of here. I'm going off with her, and I'm making her life better. I'm there for her, even when fuck-ups like you come along and derail her. You're not a part of our lives anymore. If you think you can slime your way back in, you've got a very hard lesson coming your way. Dan, come on. It was a once-off incident. Stop losing your head- If I see you again, there will be proper trouble. You got that, 'mate'? Good. [Christmas music ends] - Everything alright? - Yeah, just great. Hey, I love you baby. - 'I love you baby.' - Fuck off! You shit. [Sweeping music] - It's pretty cool, isn't it? - It's fantastic. - Ok, be careful - Think I can make it over? - Yeah, go on. - Oh! Haha! It's cold, hehehe. - It's so nice to get away. - It is nice, isn't it? A love heart! That's so cute, thank you! - Go on, try. - Ok. Ow. Nice shot, Ray Charles. You're fecking useless at this. Fecking gobshite, aren't you? Can I actually have one now? - How long is this walk? - It's not long. - Is it far? - No. - Come on! - It's cool. - We're nearly there. - God, I hate hiking. - You love it. - No I don't. You'll love this. Wow. The coast... It looks so stunning. Told ya. Rosie... Huh? What the hell? You mean so much to me. I want you with me on this journey - Dan... - Rosie, will you marry me? You know where things are between us right now. I know, that's why this is the perfect time - I'm not so... - It's ok, I want this. We can't go rushing into anything so soon after the... Listen, I've thought about it a lot, and the bright side of all of this is that I know I don't want to lose you. That doesn't mean we should get married. We still have a lot to figure out. But what's to figure out? I mean, you made a mistake and I forgive you. I want to marry you. It's not as simple as that. We're just... We're not in that place yet and I... I just... We need more time, ok? Ok. Ok. I get it. We can wait and work through it all first, it's fine. - I'm sorry. - You don't have to be sorry. [Ominous music] [Creaking] [Footsteps] [Ominous music] - How far away are we, do you think? - Not far. Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we- Sorry. - What? - We've been here before. Yeah, I told you. This is the way we walked in. We're near the car now. No, we walked past this since coming down that hill. - No. - This fallen log is not one bit familiar to you? - Okay, we got turned around. - So we're lost then? - No, we're not. - Do you know where we're going? - We're just turned around. - Turned around? What? Yeah, the... The ground kind of curves. We just ended up walking in a big circle accidentally. Accidentally? I've been following you. Yeah, well we know about it now so we're gonna go the right way. But the right way is? What? Like? Oh, just check your compass. - I don't have a compass. - On your phone. Yeah, I was just thinking that... - Huh... - Huh indeed. That's weird, isn't it? Wait. Let me try mine. Well? - That's really useful. - Oh fuck that, Dan. I'm calling time on this. Who are you calling? I just want to give Ellie a call. See can she come pick us up. - Yeah, get a search party going. - Why would you even say that? - Anything? - Nadda. Not even a dial tone. Weird. What were you saying about that search party? - We go back up. - Back up? - Uh huh. - That's a lot of effort for a lot of nothing, okay? If we just keep circling we're gonna find the path we were in. And how's that working out for you? - I'm telling you if we keep going this way - Come on. Stop being so lazy. - You okay back there? - Shut up. (Voices whispering) You can't trust him. - Hello? - What? No, not you. I heard someone... I think I heard someone... Hello? Mustn't be anything. Go on. What's up? Can you see? What the fuck? [Ominous music] This isn't right. This is- This is not right. This is not right. I don't get it. Where's the coast? Did we come up the wrong hill? This is the hill. Are you sure? We could have just walked up a different- - There's only one hill. - Well what are we looking at? It doesn't make any sense. The coast should be right there. There should be houses all around the place. It doesn't make any sense. Just chill out. We trekked in the wrong direction. We're up the wrong hill. This is the fucking hill, Rosie. We were sitting right there. Listen to me; this forest is a bit of protected land surrounded by roads and houses and the fucking coast. There's no part of it that goes on for more than, what? A few miles? But what are we looking at then? That's what I mean. I don't know. I don't fucking know. Look, it has to be here somewhere. There's no way we're this lost. There's no fucking way. This compass is fucking useless! Rosie, wait a second, will you? Okay, so the sun is up there, right? So that means it's four or five o'clock, yeah? - So then that way is east, yeah? - I guess so... Okay, let's go this way. We have to get there before it gets dark. Hey, hold on a second. Are we going to talk about this? Talk about what? That we're lost in the woods? Or the fact that we've lost an entire coastline? At the moment, I just don't want to talk about either. Still bricking itself. For fuck sake. Hey. Maybe we should turn them off, just for a bit. You know, in case we need them later and find signal. Why? How long do you expect us to be out here? Okay, look. Just come on. Let's just start walking now. [Ominous music] This absolutely sucks. I would kill for a drink right now. You don't really mean that, do you? Well, no. But I'm tired and stressed and it would taste so fucking good... Hey. Just... Just hold on a second, ok? I need a minute. Does this place look familiar to you? Are we sure this track is leading us in the right way? - Oh, fuck. Ah, shit. - Holy shit, Dan. That looks bad. - Ah, it's just sore. - Does it hurt, like, if I just do this? Ow! Hey! Hands off! I'll live but it's bad, ok? Sorry. - Do you think we should have something to eat? - Yeah, sure. Well, actually, we should keep some of that aside for later. Just in case we need it, like. No, no. You can eat that. It's just we need to keep that in mind. Yeah. Okay, I get you. What...? Dan. - Dan. - Hmm? - Turn on your phone. - Why? Do you have signal? Just turn on your phone. Just do it. - Okay. What am I looking for? - The time. - What about it? - It's 11 o'clock. Well, whatever's throwing off the compass must be messing with the phones, you know? But we've been walking for ages. It should have been dark like hours ago. - It's just been a weird day. - A weird day? It just feels like we've been walking for ages. You're kidding me. Hey, you know what... - Hello?! Hello?! - Hey, would you calm down. Hello?! We're lost, and we can't find our way out! - No one's gonna hear you. - Why, Dan? It's not as if we're in America, you know? Our forests are not that big here. We could have walked like coast to coast by now. You're just getting yourself worked up over nothing. Worked out over nothing? What are you on about? At least I'm doing something. What the hell are you doing? - I found us the track. - Which is leading us absolutely nowhere. [Phone ringing in the distance] Hello? - Hey! Hey! Can you hear us!? - Where is it? Hello? [Phone ringing continues] - Oh! Dan! - Ssh. - What? What? - The ringing stopped. Oh, that's fecking great. I just have had enough- Oh! Jesus oh! - You okay? - Yeah... Ow. You know what? I'm done, Dan. I'm done walking. I just can't walk anymore. I need a proper rest. Like, just literally for a few hours. I'm so tired. Okay. All right. How about this, all right, if you hold on for a second, take the load off. I'll come back as soon as I find someone, yeah? You want to leave me here on my own? No. You're not going anywhere without me, buddy. God knows how easily one of us would get turned around again. Oh, come on. Look, the ringing just stopped. They must be over this next bit. What if they're not, Dan? Look at your foot. You need to get off that as well for a few hours and then we'll get going, okay? Ow... Okay... Ah. Fuck. So we know which way we're heading when we get started again. Thanks. - Still cold... - Yeah, I know... [Eerie music] [Sharp harsh music] Hello? Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Help us! - Hello? - Hello!? [Music] - I need to pee. Keep a lookout, will you? - For who? - Just keep an eye, okay? - Yeah, sure. (Whispering voices) Please let me go home... - How long have we been out here...? - How could you get us so lost...? - It's getting late... - I'm so tired... We're going in circles... Dan? [Tree creaks. A twig snaps.] - [Whispering continues] - Dan, can you hear that? - Dan? - What!? Come here. (Whispering voices) You don't know where we are... Why isn't it dark...? - Where are you going...? - How long have we been out here...? - Ok? - Ssh! (Whispering voices) Admit it, you don't know where we are... You can hear that, right? (Whispering voices) How could you do this to us...? Hear what? That! What, you're telling me you can't hear that? (Whispering voices) I'm getting tired... Sorry, I can't. It's fucking loud, Dan. Honest to god, are you kidding me? What? Dan! Wait! Jesus Christ, Dan. Don't do that. - Huh? - You left me behind. Oh, sorry. [Ominous music] - That's... - Really creepy. Yeah. It's a weird place to set up an art exhibition, isn't it? - What? - What? - What's wrong? - Nothing. Don't waste that battery, remember? 'Okay, Rosie. Yeah, maybe you're right. I should conserve the battery in case we're stuck out here for one more day, not that I know how long a fucking day is apparently'. It's dead. What!? For fuck's sake, Dan. Jesus, we needed that. Listen, maybe we should push on. Push on to where? We didn't know where we were to begin with. Now we don't know where the fuck we are now. I don't know, this thing wouldn't be out here just for shits and giggles, all right? Maybe it means we're on the right track. I know, just... What if we just wait here for the person to come back and they can help us? I'm not staying here. Just lead the way then, I guess. [Video game noises] Hey, come on. I get the point. No use in wasting the rest of the battery. We might get some signal if we reach higher ground. Dan, we're not getting signal. The phones are fine. It's... It's something else. Look, if we're gonna die here- - We're not going to die. - Well, if we can't get out of this forest, this phone may as well be of some use before it bugs out. And I've a high score. What are you listening to? [Melancholy music] You say how many times can a heart break? You know like how much can one person take. You scared me. Rosie, I- What's wrong? Uh... Nothing... Just a weird dream. No, it wasn't. What did you say? Rosie, why did you say that? [High pitched noise] [Creaking] - Rosie? - [Branches cracking in the distance] - Do you hear that? - What? Do you hear it? [Crack] [Creak] [Wind begins to blow] [Forest creaks and cracks] [Harsh banging] [Creaking] [Knocking] [Intense noise] [Intense noise stops] What was that? [Phone ringing in the distance] - Wait. - Come on. [Phone rings from all around] [Ringing stops] No! God dammit! What the fuck is happening?! What the fuck?! No! Just what the fuck?! Oh my god... Oh my god... Rosie? Check this out. Is that some sort of fucking joke? It was just buried there. Doesn't even look old. What are the chances the one thing I can't have is the only thing you find. Hey, I didn't find it on purpose, okay? It was just here. Just... - Maybe we should leave it. - Yeah, maybe that's the best idea. A bottle of wine. It couldn't be any more perfect than that. [Music] Okay, so if we decide where the sun is in the sky and we head that direction we're bound to head straight. We're gonna have to find someone- - Oh. Ow... - Are you alright? Yeah... Just got dizzy for a sec, that's all... Is there any more granola? Is there any more anything? What do we do? [Tense music] No... You... Fuck! Fuck you! Get off me! Fuck! Get off! What have you done to us?! We've been walking for fucking days! Fuck! Oh, you're never getting out. What are you gonna do to us? (Demonic voice) You are gonna die here. What? You're both gonna die here. No. No! Fuck. Rosie! No! Dan? What are you doing? Dan, who are you talking to? - It was Eric. - Eric? As in... Eric the guy that I...? Slept with, yeah. I've been seeing him in the forest. But you never said anything. You didn't think how fucked up everything is that you should have said something? I didn't want to worry you. Oh, Dan... So what? You think he's really here? I... I don't think it was really him. I think it was whatever trapped us here. What did he say? Dan, what did he say to you? He... He said we won't be getting out of here. Fuck that. We are getting out of here. Now. Come on. Just... Come on. - Rosie- - Come on. We're gonna die here. He said we're gonna die here. I think we deserve this. Dan, I can't. I'm in recovery. Who cares anymore, Rosie? There's no point. No, for real. You don't know how hard this has been for me. That's very admirable. It could have led to, like, a long and happy life but we're days away from dehydration. You need your liquids. Okay. Okay. Okay. Knock knock. Who's there? Who the fuck knows? We're stuck in a forest! Ha! That's so dumb! Oh my god, like, people are going to ask 'what did you do- What did you do over the weekend' and I'm, like, 'I- Well, I went to the forest with my boyfriend and we got stuck in, like, a groundhog day little shit fest thing', you know? I loved it. Bill Murray. Look at you. We're having fun here. Oh my god, do you know what? I got it. What if we, like, trekked to the arctic circle? Like, they have months where they have like no nighttime. That's it. That is it. Yeah, I don't think that's it. Na... Yeah... It's not cold enough. I've always, like... I've always wanted to be, you know, outdoorsy stuff, you know? I never got this growing up in the city. You did. It's... It's really beautiful, you know? You get some nice fresh air and there's a feeling of walking where maybe no one else has walked before, you know, and when you camp overnight... Go on. Cold. Go on. Close your eyes. Where are they? Close them. Close them.Tell me... Tell me what we're looking at. Go on. Okay. It's a clear night. It's a bit chilly. It's a bit cold, and the stars are just extra crisp. So sharp. There's so many of them. It's like fireworks went out and they got stuck somehow. The longer you look, the more you see. If you look long enough you can start to see shapes in them. Dan...? Dan. - What? - Wake up. All of our stuff is gone. - What? - What... - What? - Our stuff is gone. What... - What? Did you see anyone? - No, I just woke up. No... No... Fuck. Motherfucker. Fuck! No! Mother fucker! (Whispering voices) We're lost... - Can you hear me...? - Please... -Please...! - I'm so thirsty... - We don't need help... - How could you do this to us...? We don't know where we're going... Fucker! (Whispering voices) I'm tired... - I'm getting tired... - How long have we been out here...? Where did you go...? Fuck! No! Fuck! You fuck! Fuck! (Whispering voices) Why is this happening...? (Whispering voices) I can't stay out here... We're just in the middle of this endless woods. No fucking thing. No food. No water. Fuck! Why not make it easy, huh? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Dan... (Whispering voices) What was that noise...? - We need to get out... - I'm getting tired... - (whispering) What was that...? - Will this ever fucking end, man? - Dan. - What!? Come here. (Whispering voices) There's definitely something over there... - I can't stay out here... - How long have we been out here.... - Why is this happening... - It's getting late.... - Do you hear this? Ssh... - Hear what? (Whispering voices) You don't know where we're going, do you...? - We're lost... - I heard something... - How could you do this to us...? - Admit it... - You don't know where we are... - Please... (whispering) I can't trust you... (whispering) Kill me... [Intense screeching noise] - Are you okay? - What was that? What is happening? What the fuck did we do? Why is this happening? - Dan... - This is hell. I'm in hell. Dan, just shut the fuck up please. I wanted to give you a memorable time. Why was that so hard? Why was that too much to ask? Please, just stop. I have a splitting headache. Please. You're so fucking ungrateful. I tried to give you everything. I went to so much trouble. You can barely give me the time of day. What? The time of day? We live together, for fuck sake. - How long is that gonna go for? - That's not fair... That's not fair? When were you planning on abandoning me? When our lease ran out? Look that's just- It's not important right now, okay? It's.... It's pretty fucking important, Rosie! Cause I care about people in my life. - Unlike you. - Are you actually for real? I tried to give you everything? We're stuck in the fucking woods, Dan. We need to get a bit of perspective here. Oh I have a lot of perspective now, okay? I can see it now. We could have had our happily ever after. All you had to do was say yes, but you fucking ruined it and now we're going to die here. Yeah? You're an absolute piece of shit. Do you know that? I was going to leave you but I wasn't going to abandon you, because I'm not some boogie woman or whatever. What? You knew I was gonna leave? What? You thought proposing to me was better than actually talking to me? What the hell is wrong with you? You're pathetic. What? You wanted to woo me or something, was it? All this fairy tale talk, well that's bullshit talk right there, isn't it? I don't need a toxic shit like you in my life. Do you hear me? I deserve better, and I'm not fucking dying in these woods, do you hear me? Look, I just want- Dan? [Ominous music] Dan? [Ominous music continues] Dan! Dan! Dan! Dan! [Ominous music builds] [Ominous music becomes creepy] [Ominous music builds again] [Music stops] Eric? [Heavy breathing] [Flies buzzing] - [Monstrous scream] - Aaah! Ow... [Ominous music builds] [Ominous music ends] [Phone buzzing] Hello? - Rosie? - Dan! Dan! Where are you? - Rosie? - What? - Will you marry me? - What? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Go away... Dan... Dan... D- Dan...? Dan. [Whispering all around] [Creaking wood] [Creatures growling] - Rosie... - Ah! Ow! Ow! [Crying] I just want to go home. Why is this happening to me? I just want to go home! [Crying] Ow. Oh my god... Oh Dan... Dan... (Whispering voices) Stop... - I just want to go home... - Stop it... - Why are you doing this to me...? - Who's there...? - I don't deserve this... - How are you doing this...? - I swear I won't tell... - This is insane... [Creature growling] [Branches cracking] [Horrific screaming] [Distorted yelling] [Angry dog barks] [Intense sounds] [Optimistic music rises quietly] [Nondescript whispering] (Dan) Will you marry me? [Music rises] [Music stops] [Worried breathing] What? [Ominous music] Dan? Oh, Dan! Oh! - I didn't know if I'd find you again. - I was so scared. Come on. We have to get out of here. Where are you taking me? Where are we going? Oh my god, thank you. [Optimistic music] [Music fades] - There. Comfy? - Yeah. Good. - Dan, wait. - What? What happened to you when you disappeared? When I disappeared? When we weren't together. What did you see? I don't remember much. Just a lot of walking. And my feet hurting. And I missed you a lot. We were so lucky to get out of there. I would never let anything happen to you. You're my world. It's you and me. Together. Now you rest. [Rosie sighs] [Wood creaks] [Ominous music] What's going on? [Ominous music rises] [Coughing] Fuck! Ow... Dan? No! What are you doing? Stop it! Stop! No! [Bone cracks] Stop! [Nose cracks] [Tense music] [Heavy breathing] Ah! Aaah! No! No! No! No! No! Aah! [Bone crack] Ah... [Coughing] No! [Coughing] No! [Squelchy noise] No! [Bone crunching] [Bone crunching] Die! [Bone crunching] [Bone crunching] [Bone crunching] [Bone crunching] [Eccentric music] [Music turns to solemn tone] [Struggled cries] (In the distance) Do you know which way the path goes? - I think it splits off both directions. - And we want to go up that one? Yeah, yeah. If you walk down there, we go the other direction. [Struggled cries] [Attempted yells but can't get loud] [Wood creaking] [Animal hiss] [Ominous music rises] [Concerned cry] [Wood moving] [Wood moving] [Wood cracking and flesh morphing] (monstrous) Rosie... [Scream] [Music climaxes] Hey, are you ok? [Cries] Is she alright? What happened? What's going on? Are you alright? Can you hear us? It's ok. It's ok. Come on. [Cries] Come on, let's go. It's ok. Come on. [Optimistic music] [Music fades to ominous music] [Ominous music] [Industrial sounds] [whoosh]
