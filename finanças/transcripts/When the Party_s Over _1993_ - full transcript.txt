Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment i've got to quit smoking. So much for new year's resolutions. You really fucked everything up, didn't you, m.j.? Amanda, quit attacking me. You have no idea what i've been going through. Fighting isn't getting us anywhere, you guys. Don't you think maybe we should go look for her? Maybe. I don't know. What time is it anyway? Just after 2:00. And it looks like we're gonna be here for a while. Does anybody want more coffee? You certainly know how to clear out a party. Give it a rest, amanda. Let's face it. This isn't the first time you've ruined one of our little soirées. Oh, yeah? For instance... for instance, your birthday. Come on, everybody. Let's surprise her. 1, 2, 3! Surprise! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday, m.j. uh, henry, meet my roommates. My best friend frankie... hello, henry. And her boyfriend taylor. And this is banks and amanda. Hi, henry. How you doing? Uh... i'm late. I've got to get ready for work. Hey, good morning, los angeles! It's 7 a.m., september 1, and a cloudy 68 degrees. And here's the new one from rain on fire... called here we are. Yeah. What?! Amanda, it's dan. Willie has disappeared again. I'm damn sure he's not on his way to school. I found all of his books under his bed. If he shows up, will you please redirect him, and try to stress the importance of an education to him? That brother of yours won't make it out of the eleventh grade at this rate. Good morning! I can't go back there. I just left that place... oh, 6 hours ago. Hey... let's both call in sick today. Come on. We can go sailing, and we can do it all day long. Please. You know i can't, and neither can you. Why? Because mario starts the mural today. It's a big day. He needs me. I need you, too. Come on back to bed. Taylor, get up. I refuse to move until you come back here and kiss me now. Oh! Hmm, hmm, hmm. Mmm. Morning. Mm. Morning. Who the fuck finished off my captain crunch? Amanda, please. Hey, baby, what's for breakfast? Oh! Willie! Nice going. Good morning. Hey, banks. Morning. I've got a big audition today. Oh, hey. You may be looking at the future... mr. Cat chow. Right on, brother. Everybody owes me rent money. The shower's fucked up again. Then somebody has to call the landlord. Not it. Not it. Not it. Not it. Has anybody seen my white silk shirt? Now what? Ah, henry! Um, i'm late. I--i'll call you. So, you guys, what time is this birthday dinner tonight? About 8:30. Sounds a little early for m.j. bye. See ya. Oh, amanda, you're gonna make the cake, right? One of your special 4-layers with pretty roses and stuff? Taylor, toast. Don't get on me tonight. Aw, it would mean a lot to m.j. if you were there. Oh... i'll see what i can do. Well, bye. So who's the guy? Just a guy. Well, i hope you're being careful. Yes. Thank you. I'm using condoms. I hate them, but i'm using them. I'll see you tonight, mother. See you tonight, dear. And try not to be too late. You are going to school. Forget school. Look at it outside! Come on, let's go to the beach and eat cheeseburgers. Will, dad called this morning, ok? He's pissed. Yeah, well, fuck him. I mean, school's whack. Really, minx. You wouldn't believe what they had us doing yesterday. We spent the entire health class putting rubbers on bananas. It's totally bogus. I mean, besides, my band is kickin' ass. I want to be famous like my big sister. Yeah, well, i'm hardly famous. Yet. Yet. Yet. Hey, boss, it's me. Yeah, i'm sorry i'm late. I had a little problem this morning that i couldn't get rid of. Uh-huh. Yeah, i did hear about that takeover bid. What's the reaction in the market? Really? Uh-huh. Well, i spoke to my infamous c.p.a. friend, and i'm gonna see him at 4:00 for drinks, then i'm on to my stinky rich gold and oil friends, yeah. Yeah, i think they're ready to close the deal. Oh, and david? I'm sorry, but this will never happen again. Ok? Right. Right. Bye. Now 30-year treasuries are eight... oh, shit. Fuck. Hey, you got another hole in your ear. Yeah, stacey made me do it. Stacey? Who's stacey? My woman. Wait a minute. I thought jocelyn was your girlfriend. That ended weeks ago. Hi, mr. Solomon. Hiya! What is this, mr. Rogers' neighborhood? Who the hell knows their neighbors in los angeles? Hey, can i come to the birthday party tonight? In the car. You are late for school. Please? Oh, stuart, this is all my fault, but let's not get the insurance company involved, ok? I mean, they can be such a hassle. Let me level with you. Today's my 25th birthday, and if i don't get to work in 5 minutes, i'm gonna lose my job. Ok, ok. Calm down. You look like a smart man. Yeah. What do you do? No, let me guess-- hollywood. You make great movies. No, actually, real estate. That was my second guess. Commercial, definitely. How'd you know? Your style. The armani suite. A man who enjoys the finer things in life. You're good at what you do. And so am i. And what is it that you're so good at? Making intelligent people terrifyingly rich. You know, we should get together and talk business. And then we can clear up this matter about the car. Eh, it's... actually not that bad. I know a mechanic who owes me a favor. Perfect. Let me give you my number. My business cards are being reprinted, so i'll give you my home number. Call me, stuart. Ok... linda. Hey, linda. Yes, stuart? Happy birthday. Thank you. Jesus, hallelujah. Oh, mario. I thought we'd use the whole wall, and we'd have, like, this vibrant blue color and these huge eyes that are just, like, piercing down at you. Mm-hmm. And then, um, it'd be kind of like an abstract thing with this aztec style. You know, like, with the little, um, shapes, and then they make up the whole picture. And then, of course, we'd sign my name at the bottom, like that, in big letters. 6-foot letters. So typical of m.j. to miss her own party. You guys, this is ridiculous. Why don't we just go home? Oh, come on. I'm sure she just got caught up with work. You know how she tries to do everything at once. Ooh, sounds seamy to me. I'm sure she's got a perfectly fine reason for not being here. Now, can we just relax? Probably some guy. Named jose cuervo? Who's that? Great idea! Shots for everybody. All right, then. Yo, bartender! Why didn't you tell us earlier it was your birthday? Oh, because it's no big deal. You know, i should probably be going. Nonsense. Aren't you guys exhausted? What year were you born, young lady? My mother taught me never to reveal my age. Well, how does 1969 sound? Close enough. All right, one more. I'll drink to that. They kept me sitting there for 3 1/2 hours with these screaming felines crawling all over my body just to see if i was a cat person. I've got fleas and scratches all over me. I hate cats. Hey, waiter? Well, guys, i just called the house, and she's not there. Ah, a sucker is born every minute. Wait till you see mario's sketch for the mural. It's so beautiful. Really? Oh, that's great. That's really cool. I can't wait to see it. Yeah, me, too. That would be-- ok, ok, ok. Chill out. Oh, this is bullshit. You know something? You guys can sit here and wait all night long if you want to, but i'm gonna go play some pool. Great idea, minx. What exactly is in cat chow? I don't exactly know, but it tastes mostly like cardboard... with this touch of gross fish guts. Mmm. So the director says, "i like what you do with the acting, but i don't feel the connection between the cat." I was like, no, i love cats. I--i've had cats all my life. I-- well, look who showed up. Hi, guys. I'm really sorry. By the time i got to the restaurant, you guys had already left. She's bombed. I totally lost track of time. You know, m.j., you're one lucky bitch you got friends like us, 'cause nobody else would put up with your shit. I know. I'm really sorry, you guys. But i brought ice cream-- toffee heath bar crunch, new york super fudge chunk, chocolate burnt almonds... aw, come on, you guys. I'm gonna take everybody out big time when i collect my commission on these clients. You should've seen the money that was flying. We had 3 $500 bottles of champagne. So? We were drinking longnecks for, what, 2.50 a bottle? Had to be, at least. Oh. Anybody want anything? I'm getting a beer. No, i'm fine. I'll have a beer. Yeah, me, too. Listen, willie. 16-year-olds who drink too much to be cool end up on the bathroom floor throwing up. She speaks from experience. No way, minx. I'm not drunk. I am not. I'm just happy. I mean it. Happy birthday. Oh, thanks, banks. I'll get it. Not here. I am not here. Not here. Hello? Yeah, hi, this is henry. Is m.j. there? Oh, hang on a minute. M.j., it's henry. I'm not here. Oh, silly me! M.j.'s still out. Yeah, all right, i'll have-- i've called 2 times before-- fine. Bye. Well, make sure-- that's the third time he's called today. Tell me about it. Fuck 'em once, they want to put a goddamn leash around your neck. Did you by chance grow up in a truck stop, amanda? Banks, why are you a fag? Willie! Why? Uh... it's a long and complicated story that i-- oh, brother. Anybody want to help me put this little nightmare to bed? Let's take him out back and shoot him first. Little shit. I'm gonna go to bed, too. You coming? Uh, in a minute. Ready? Happy birthday, m.j. really just a pleasure spending the evening with you. Ok. ♪ Oh, we have something for you ♪ oh! Happy birthday. Oh, god. It's really from everyone, so... oh, my god. Oh, frankie, this is so beautiful. It's from indonesia. Watch his head. Yeah, i like this. Frankie... i'm sorry about tonight. It's ok. I understand. Happy birthday, girlfriend. I love you, frankie. Mmm. Well, i'm going to bed. Hey, m.j., um... i thought henry was kinda cute. Why didn't you want to talk to him? Because there are 200,000 henrys in l.a., and i just haven't found one that i want to spend the rest of my life with. Hmm. Well, don't give up. It happened to me. All right, well, good night. Good night, frankie. Taylor. You know when i realized i was turning into an adult? I was driving really fast one day, and i could visualize being in a car accident-- the crunching metal, being pinned against the steering wheel. Maybe that was just a message to slow down? You know, like cracking the mercedes. Oh, please. I got out of that one, no problem. Besides, you've gotta move really quick to get what you need in this lifetime. Even if that means hurting people? Come on, banks. You both want it just as badly as i do. Miss metropolitan museum, and you, the aspiring actor. Yeah, well, at least we're not self destructive. I mean, come on, m.j., where's your sense of self worth? I mean, you are always taking advantage of people and you know it. I really don't need a lecture on morals. You know, sometimes i wonder if you even have any. Want to try it on? I didn't hear you come in. It's gettin' too crazy. What are you talking about? Things are becoming serious with frankie. Oh, i'm so happy for you. I just have one question, though. Why are you still sleeping with me? It can't happen anymore. I just wanted to tell you that. So these women really put on gorilla masks and protest sexism in the arts? Yeah. Somehow i can see you slinking through the streets in a fake black fur. Yeah, well, at least they're making a statement about the white male domination in the art world. I mean, you walk into any art gallery and you look at the ratio... i mean, it's pitiful! It's the same white male artists over and over and over again. You know, i swear, i am going to start the l.a. chapter of the guerilla girls. Watch me, i will. I know. It's like every time i turn on the tv, it's the same faces getting the same bad tv roles. You know, sometimes i really wonder what the hell i'm doing. Like today, i have this audition. The casting director's all smiles, "that was a perfect delivery, banks, that was wonderful!" And then she shuffles me out and shuffles in 6 other guys who look just like me. I just feel like i'm wasting my time. No, you are not. Hey, you've got 2 national commercials. I mean, that is great. Any horse's ass can drink a soft drink and sell ketchup. Nuh-uh. I'm thinking of getting back into the theater. Yeah? Back east somewhere. My agent keeps telling me that a movie will happen soon, but yada, yada, yada. It's like i keep waiting for something out there to make me feel whole and complete, but... but maybe that's my problem. Come on, banks. Ok, you-- you have to have those dreams, you know? And those goals, too. I don't know. I think the future's overrated, anyway. I mean, whatever happened to living in the present? You know, being happy day by day. How often do you find yourself thinking "as soon as i get that job, "or meet that person or sell that painting, then i'm gonna be happy." You know, i think there's something inherently wrong with that way of thinking. I think we constantly set ourselves up for dissatisfaction. I-- hey, hey. I'm sorry. I'm just in a piss of a mood. I had a lousy audition, i don't have enough money for rent. Hey, listen, you know i sold a painting last week so it's no problem if you need the money. Ok? Thanks. You're welcome. Thanks. I might have to take you up on that. We'll do it. I really like that one. I think it's gonna be great. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Well, maybe someday it'll hang in the museum of contemporary art. You hang onto those dreams, girlfriend. That's why we stay in this smog-infested city. Come on, i gotta change for an appointment, and then i'm gonna buy you some breakfast. Come on, joey, hurry up, man! Hey, frankie? Yeah? Did you hear about george's brother? No. E.s.g. got him. His first night out of jail, they shot him. Oh, my god. You're staying out of it, aren't you? Mario? Yeah, yeah. I'm not stupid. Give it to me, give it to me! Give it back! Come on! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! All right, you, sit down. You, sit down. Now you just sit here until you're ready to behave, ok? I got plenty of other kids that want to paint. I'm really sick of you picking on people, george! Why don't you mind your own business? Because it is my business. You could have called to tell me this, but you didn't. You came here. I know why you're here, and so do you. M.j., it's over with now. I just wanted to see you face to face and be done with it. Now, taylor, wouldn't you miss our little rendezvous'? Stop it. I know you want me. How can you go on doing this? You know, i thought she was your friend. Same way you can. I know how you feel about me. I can see it in your eyes. I don't feel that way anymore. Touch me, taylor. I want you to touch me. Touch me. Please? Taylor, your heart's beating fast. So is mine. So fast. Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop. Well, you see, in this painting here, she's holding his head out of the window because she's deciding whether or not to keep him, and the monkey around her neck symbolizes the relationship which--which doesn't go beyond the physical. Hmm. That's, uh, interesting. What size is that? Uh, this one's 6 by 8. Do you have anything smaller? No. Yeah, to be honest. I'm not sure i have any openings for some time, but, uh, maybe over dinner you could convince me to rearrange my schedule. What do you say? Um... thanks... but no thanks. Oh! Oh, god, what if somebody comes home? Nobody's coming home for hours. Hello! Is anybody home? Oh, shit, somebody's here! Grab my jacket, get my jacket! Ahh. Mm-mmm. Nectar. Hey, will. Hey. Are you coming to my boss' party today? Absolutely. Where is it? Malibu. Free beer? All you can drink. I suppose i can check it out. Amanda, on answering machine: speak! The car has been stolen. Before i call the police, i thought your brother might have an idea about-- hi, dad. Hi, dad. Yeah, amanda, willie wouldn't be there by any chance, would he? Yeah, yeah, he's here. Did you know he's supposed to be grounded? No, no, that was my fault. I asked him to come over and help me hang some stuff. Well, it would have been nice if he'd let me know he was-- no, no, no, you're right. He should have left a note. All right, well, make sure he doesn't drink anything. No, i promise. And be sure he gets home ok, would you? Ok. All right, bye, honey. Speak to you soon. Ok. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. You're busted! Will, you gotta stop stealing dad's car! Come on, i can't face all those gonads on the bus! And besides, the car's just sitting there. He's never around anyway. What's with all the beer? Oh, god. Thanks for covering for me. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, what time's that party today? You are not going to the party. You are going home. But m.j. invited me! No! Besides, you owe banks an apology, and until he gets one, this house is off-limits, ok? Banks? I meant it! Anybody home? Oh. Hi, guys. Banks, dude, look. I'm sorry about asking why you're a butt pirate. Oh, my god. Willie! Ok, no hard feelings, all right, man? What?! What? M.j. m.j., your boss has a nice little beach house. This is just for weekends. It's the biggest place in town. Oh, my god. Divine. Wow. Nervous, frankie? Mm-hmm. All right, let's go. Thank you. Hey. Thanks. Oh, my god. David! I'm going to the bar. Excuse me. Oh, champagne. Cheers. M.j., it's about time. And of course you know julia. Julia. Nice to see you, m.j. you look so--so skinny. The house is great. Everything looks-- it's nice of you to say so. Would you excuse me for a minute? I need to have a word with the caterer. All right. Bye--bye, honey. Oof, your wife hates me. Well, of course. But for all the right reasons. I'd take it as a compliment. It's good to see you again. Sorry, but... i don't know you. Yes, you do. But you might not remember. It wasn't in this lifetime. But i'm sure it's you. Apparently, you're mistaking me for somebody who just might buy into this shit. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I want to talk to you. Every thought, every feeling, every action of my life, my pasts... has led me to this moment. You are the other half. Spare me, ok? The more you know, the less you'll understand. Alexander. Alexander midnight. When did you make that one up? I come from a long lineage of midnights. Let me guess. When you're not, um, you know, passing out the cocktails, i bet... that you are an actor. And if i said yes, what does that mean? Do you so easily define people by their-- by their occupations? Don't we measure a person's strength on what we call "distinction"? True individuality? Everyone wants to make their mark, but the buddhists say, "that is only the pursuit of a phantom." You're not one of those chanting buddhists, are you? But this--this identity, this label, it's merely a thought, it's a picture of who we are, what we can be. It's an illusion. Do you want to take a walk? Well, i thought you were working this party. Not anymore. Whoa! Windy! Heh. How are you? Fine. Vic. Vic montana. Hello. Pleasure's all yours. Excuse me, i have to... get a--my-- excuse me. You know, you remind me of someone. So, is there anything you want to confess? You seem like the type of person who has a lot of secrets. Why would i tell you? Because you like me. No, i don't. Yes, you do. No, i don't. Yes, you do. I do not! You're lying! How can you tell? 'Cause your nostrils are flaring. No, they're not. Yes, they are. They're not! They are. They're not. You're very cute. Hey! Hi, honey. Hello. I just met the fruit of the loom grape. He's actually a hell of a nice guy. Hey... that guy, he's really cute. Very cute. You're not shopping. Oh, yeah. Where is taylor anyway? I don't know. Probably working. Everything ok with you guys? Yeah. You know what, banks? I think i'm gonna marry him. Really? Someday. Well, i'm happy for ya. Thank you. That's great. So why are you so quiet all the time? Why do you ask so many questions all the time? I want to know everything about you. Well, maybe i'm resting my brain. You have this goddess thing about you, you know that? Really? You remind me of aphrodite. Well, maybe i should have been a statue in somebody's garden. What are you so angry about? I admire you social workers for doing something so selfless in this town full of egomaniacs. And i'm no exception. Banks, yes, you are. Listen, honey, you're wasting your time with tinkerbelle here. Call me. Hey, loved your shampoo spot. It worked. Yeah. Don't ask. Having fun at your party? No. You? I love your parties. Yeah, well, you have to say that. You work for me. No. I mean, look at all these dreadful people i'm forced to entertain, pretending to like each other. At least in new york, people hate each other openly. Although, there is one person i'd like you to meet, mm-hmm. Over there, see him? Paul knowles. Major venture capitalist, recently divorced. Aphrodite. You want to take a dip? What, you think i'm gonna get in this thing with you? Why not? Well, what if somebody comes in? I mean, i usually don't make a habit of getting into hot tubs with people i just met at a party. But we didn't just meet. Ok, the other life, i completely forgot, i'm sorry. Hey, it's just a tub. Plus, look what i found. ♪ Bum bum bum ♪ ok, ok, but, um... just leave your underwear on. Oh. I wouldn't have it any other way. Here, you can wear my t-shirt. I'll just, uh, i'll wait under here... until you've changed. All right. Ahh. Ahh. Hey, come on, hurry up, all right? And don't look. Actually, i just got back from spending a month in kenya. Ooh. How wonderful. Yeah, it was. People there say it's the soul of the universe. I think so. Good place to get away, clear your mind. Ah. But enough about that stuff. David tells me you're the new fireball down at the brokerage. I love my job. Maybe we should get together and, uh-- talk money? Well, i had thought about a little dinner first. That would be great. Let me give you my card. Great. My home number's on it. Call me. Perfect. Thanks. My brother and i used to pretend we were in seahunt and stay under water for 45 minutes and really freak our mother out. How amusing. Stop it. Hey, how come you're so worried about being miss perfect all the time, huh? Stop it! Don't you realize that is it precisely our imperfections that makes each human individually loveable? Do you ever take some time and actually listen to the shit that you say? Do you? I am a firm believer in love at first sight. And few people are fortunate enough to experience it. So why are you telling me this? When i saw you earlier, i knew that we had been together before. That's what love at first sight is. It's a reconnection of 2 old, intertwined souls. It's snowing. Hey man, thanks a lot for the party. Oh, yes. We'll really have to have you over next time. Thank you very much. Thank you, betty. Hey, wait a second! Wasn't that guy working for us? I know, i should have called. Are you mad? No, i was just worried when you never showed up. I know, i'm sorry. But i... i'm just not in the mood to be at a party tonight. Taylor, what's going on? I woke up this morning wondering... how much of my life am i going to spend working on cases that... i don't care about? So i quit. Do you think i'm crazy? No. I mean... i don't know what i'm gonna do, but somehow that just doesn't seem... very important right now. Boy, i knew you were unhappy. I had no idea it was this extreme. Yeah. Well, i kinda wish you had talked to me about it. Well, uh-- it's just something i needed to work out alone. But why don't you let me help you? I love you, taylor. I just want us to be happy. Pphttt. I gotta go to bed, you guys. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm tired. I'll see you tomorrow. Ok, honey. It was fun. Good night. Bye. Mmm. I think i'm gonna turn in, too. Amanda? Yeah? Who was that guy that you disappeared with? Oh, he's just another lunatic who's convinced we were lovers in a past life. Oh, dear. It's very frightening. Good night, honey. Good night. Henry, on answering machine: hi, this is henry's machine. I'm not home right now-- hello, i'm here! Don't hang up! Hello! Like, one minute you can't stand the guy, and then you're picking up the phone and you're calling him. Oh, you're one to talk. Hopping into hot tubs with total strangers. M.j., nothing happened. Of course, i understand why that's so difficult for you to believe, because you probably would have fucked him. Just because some of us enjoy sex doesn't imply that i'm a slut. Henry wasn't your type anyway. Neither were half the other guys i've ever dated. Do you guys know that i lost my virginity to a kleptomaniac? His name was bobby rose. Seriously, after he took my virginity, he stole my father's watch. A total klepto. Well, at least you remember his name. I lost my virginity to doris becker, and i've never been the same since. Boris becker? Boris becker, my god! So, uh, banks, have you ever thought that, i don't know, maybe you just haven't been with the right woman yet? Well, that's definitely not the issue here, but thank you for the offer. Oh, you're welcome. Look, i haven't lost my virginity yet, but i'll be sure to share it with you all in great detail when i do. Oh, jeez, isn't anybody tired in this house? It's 4 a.m.! You know what's the really weird thing? Is that the only thing i can remember is that it was in my parents' house behind the couch. It's so scary how our brains let us remember only isolated memories. I think it's all still in there, but as we get older, our brain, you know, sorts through all those ideas and memories and feelings and philosophies. And it's like it's all compacting and compressing down. But you know, like, a diamond is formed? Ok, so we're forming a diamond in our minds of who are we are and what we need to know. Sometimes i think it's best just to forget certain things that have happened to us. So, where are we going tonight? He's making me dinner. Oh, how nineties. Oh, honey, you can't wear that. So, what--who's making you dinner? The man i met at david's house. The older one? Uh-huh. Oh! Ugh, i do look fat. Oh! Yeah, you-- she's really fat. She's huge. At least 10 pounds overweight on the hips. I haven't seen much of you or taylor lately. Taylor quit his job, you guys. Really? Wow. He didn't want me to say anything. Been in a really weird mood lately. What an idiot. He was making so much money. So what is he gonna do now? I don't know. Tonight's our one year anniversary. Oh, god, i hope he remembers. Doubtful. I'm just kidding! Amanda, mr. Midnight's been calling an awful lot lately. Not interested. I mean, as friends. You know, he's helping me put together a show and stuff. I think he's good looking and i think you guys make a fabulous couple. Listen, you can't wear underwear with that. You have major v.p.l. then i'm not gonna go. Christ, will you just put anything on?! You'll take it off, anyway. It's different with paul. He's older, sophisticated. Besides, he's a potential client, and i have never slept with a client. Mmm, mmm, mmm. The opera man! Taylor... i'm really glad you remembered. I thought for sure you'd forget. You don't know what i'm talking about. Of course i do. What, then? Jesus, taylor. Hi. - Hi. Wow, you look great. Thanks. Come on in. Thank you. Hello? Hey, is amanda there? She's not here at the moment. Can i take a message and ask who's calling, please? This is alexander midnight. Hi, alex, how you doing? Is there something wrong with your voice? No, there's nothing wrong with my voice. What are you doing tonight? Tonight? Yeah. I'm painting. Well, can you go out? I want to show you something. I don't think so. Oh, come on, why not? Because. Your nostrils are flaring. Your nostrils are flaring. No, my nostrils are not flaring, ok? Yes, they are. I'm gonna come over, ok? Ok. Ok, fine. Ok, but just for an hour. No problem, no problem, just an hour. Ok. Bye. What a piece of work is man? How noble in reason? Of infinite and faculties, in form and moving. How express and admirable. In action, how like an angel... in apprehension. How like a god. The beauty of the world, the paragon of animals. ♪ My kitty, your kitty, everybody's little kitty ♪ ♪ likes to eat its chow ♪ meow! ♪ My kitty, your kitty-- ♪ oh, man. Forget it. Thanks, i'm glad you like it. I find it attractive when a woman appreciates a good wine. My ex-wife always used to complain that it gave her a headache. Well... so what happened? If you don't mind my asking. No, that's all right. I found out that she'd been having an affair. For quite a long time. How awful. Yeah, it broke my heart. I'm just glad we didn't have any kids. But it's been a while now. Since then i've been having love affairs with french burgundies from the seventies. Cheers. All right, hold on. I know what this place is. I didn't come up here to fuck you, so don't even think about it, all right? Whoa. Who hurt you so bad? I'd never fuck you, ok? I just wanted to show you one of my favorite places. Look... i really need you right now... to be patient with me. It's not that i don't care, because... i do. I--i-- i'm sorry. God, you smell great. Where did you take this photo? Oh. Well, i spent a lot of time exploring the serengeti, and i took this shot from the taita hills at about, uh, 7,000 feet. You can see for hundreds of miles from this spot, and at night, there'd be these incredible lightning storms that just ignite the entire plane. Beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. You know, heh, we've talked about food. Why don't we talk about money? What are you thinking about? About the different ways looking up at the stars can make me feel. Like how? Well... when you read things like... we're just one galaxy of some hundred thousand million galaxies, and each galaxy itself contains some hundred thousand million stars. I mean... how are you supposed to get out of bed in the morning? You know? It wasn't until... last week that i realized... i'd been afraid to look up at the night sky. You know, instead of being in awe of it all or amazed... at the mystery and the beauty. That was terrifying. Everything felt unbearably huge. But then last night... i stayed up all night just sittin' right here thinkin'... and i was overcome by the sense that... everything was gonna be ok. Even if i didn't really understand why. And despite how fucked up or chaotic things may seem, it... well, maybe there is some order to it all. I mean, it can't just be coincidence. There are the smallest of perfections in the most... unlikely places. Like... the swell of your lips. Or the curve of your breast. I want you to come, frankie. I want to watch you come. You know, i really should get going. Why? Because i just don't think we should be doing this. Why not? Well, um, ow. Wait. Wait a second. You know, i don't-- wait, paul! No! No, wait, please, i don't want this. Why don't you want this? Because! No, no! No, paul, stop it! No! No! No! No! Aah! I want to travel. Hmm, where to? I don't know. It just seems like the only thing holding me to this down are these dock lines and you. How the hell is that supposed to make me feel? What-- it means that i love you. I want to go. Will you take me home? I'm sorry. Tonight was such a disaster. Do you want me to come inside? No, it's late. I have to get up really early. So... tell me 3 images from your childhood. Quick. Don't even think about it. Cats, lime jell-o, and... baseball games. Good. And you? Me? Mm-hmm. Kneeling, snow, and my twin brother. You have a twin brother? Mm-hmm. Charlie. Charlie midnight. He's excellent. Oh, god. Not another one of you. I gotta go. So you'll remember me. See you around, kid. Are you mad at me? No, i'm not mad at you. I'm just tired. I'll see you tomorrow, ok? H-hey-- oh, my god. M.j. w-wait--what-- what happened to you? Hey. What happened to you? My god. It makes you wonder what the word "no" means to some people, doesn't it? God. I wonder how many other women this has happened to. Tons. I offer no excuse for those of my sex. I mean, half the male ego problem stems from the fact that we can't have children. Women are--are-- are so much more grounded because they can give a child life. Whereas men, they're in this constant battle, whether blatant or subtle, to make their mark in the world. Well, he certainly made his mark. So why didn't you nail his ass? M.j., it was like you just let him get away with it. Amanda, i really wish you would stop throwing this in my face. Do you know what i went through? Do you have any idea? Have you ever been raped? Well, if you're not gonna deal with it legally, you know, like pressing charges, i think maybe you should work it out emotionally. What are you talking about-- emotionally? Get in touch with my feelings? You're the ice princess of the world and you're telling me to get in touch with my feelings. I am talking about using it as a fucking excuse for treating the other people in your life like shit. Ohh... you know... whew. I thought you understood. What... what time is it? It's early. It's very early and i'm sorry. It's ok. I've been up all night fighting a panic attack. Sometimes i just feel like i'm--i'm so dried up inside and that there's something... sucking the life out of me and... i don't know what-- i try to fight it, but... come here. Honey... i'm sorry. Just think of what you've been through. You know, i really think that you should press charges against this bastard. No. No, i just want to put it all behind me. M.j., this fucker raped you. You can't expect those feelings just to disappear 3 weeks later. Yeah, but, you know... maybe--maybe i-- maybe i brought it on myself. Don't you dare say that. It's your body. He had no business forcing you into doing something that you did not want to do. Yeah, and then david said that paul totally lied to me, that--that it was his wife that caught him in bed with another woman. I am such an idiot. I can't believe i fell for his crap. He's a pig. But, hey, how are you supposed to know? God, i... i just can't get it out of my head. I'm sorry. How you doin'? Who's bones? Frankie? Why her? 'Cause she's so damn skinny. That's a good call. I heard there was a shooting last night. What happened? I don't know. Mario, what happened? A few of the boys from the hood did a drive-by and wasted some of the e.s.g. were you there? No. Mario. No way. I can't believe 2 kids are dead over graffiti. Yeah, well, people get shot down here for all sorts of reasons. That's just the way it is. Hey! What's you doin'? Cut it out. I got you. Hey, hey, hey. You're a menace. Come over and help us paint. I don't give a fuck about your stupid mural. You lied. You said you were gonna take us to the beach. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man, chill, ok? You be cool. Look. She's down with us, homeboy, so why don't you stop causing scenes like this or we're not getting any more paint, do you understand? Huh? Ok, go on. Go finish your work. By the way, i lined up the next space. They're gonna pay you. Cool. Um... who's your friend with the hair? That's my housemate. Amanda? Yeah? Mario. Mario, amanda. How you doin'? Hi. I really like your work. Uh, thank you. You're welcome. Can i help you paint? Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. It'd be an honor. Cool. You can start over here and, uh... i'm famished. I'm always starving before a show. I need more fuel for maximum energy. Oh, by the way, did i mention that i made a manikin of you out of papier-mache? She sits in my bathtub sipping a martini. I tell her all my secrets, and she just smiles. Who is this guy? Radical board, dude. You been half-pipin' it lately? Alex, this is willie. Willie, the little bro. What's happenin'? How's it hangin', slim? Pretty good. Cool. I got baseball cards, minx. Thanks, little bro. Where you guys goin' with this thing? Whoa. We're gonna go hang these at the club where alex is doing his performance art piece tonight. You gonna come, dude? Well, if it's ok with minx. Sure it is. Yeah, you can get a ride with m.j. bye. Sexy. Whoo! Oh, i gotta show you my place. I hear you've been having some sort of existential meltdown. May i recommend a bottle of wild turkey, a copy of sartre's la nausee, and a double-barreled shotgun to cure this affliction. Come on, it's a joke. Yeah. I'm--i'm glad you're here. I've been wanting to talk to you. About? About what happened to me a couple weeks ago. I want to say thank you. You don't have to thank me. No. It really meant a lot, you being there like that, and i just wanted to say... thank you. You just tell me where he lives, i swear i'll kick the shit out of him. Oh, no. I'm just trying to put it behind me. I'm just sorry that it happened to you. Friends? You know what the really sad part is? For a minute there, it felt like somebody was out there for me. Yeah, right. Sometimes i wonder if there's any hope for romance. This is it. Oh, wow. This is great. Yes, i'm into organized chaos. I can see that. Oh, wait. What? I have something for you. I'll get it. So, um, finish telling me about this--this crazy theory of yours. What did you call it-- accessible... happiness. My theory of accessible happiness. And it's not crazy. See, if you can think of 3 accessible things, little things that make you happy, that you can always count on, because they are immediately attainable. It works. Like for me. I have my motorcycle, led zeppelin, and my third thing is-- oh, god. Big sandwiches. All right. Good as mine. Ohh! Oh! Oh, god! Ohh! Damn. You broke my nose, you creep! Good. So, in the 12th century there was this radical mutation in human feelings and consciousness. It was then that the origins of romantic love can be found. People finally began saying fuck you to prearranged marriages, going against the church's will, willing to risk burning in hell for love. It was the time of those crazy troubadours who wore tight velvet pants and sang songs of love to ladies who tested and tortured them and made them wait. But they waited... because it was for true love. Do you ever stop talking? So, after fighting many silly battles-- whoo-- and standing around and guarding unnecessary bridges and waiting in the rain reciting endless poetry... the ladies would either refuse the troubadours or accept them as lovers, by saying... merci. Merci beaucoup, mon amour. Isn't that incredible? You have to read this book. All of these books. Do you know what they all have in common? I have no idea. They all have something interesting to say on page 36. Page 36. Yes. It's a 9 number. The number 9 represents contact with the inner soul, greater self-expression, the order of the angels. Ok. It's a little trick i picked up from granny midnight. You'd be surprised. She also gave me black panthie. And my pet emperor scorpion sufi. Would you like to meet him? No. Sufi. Come here. Su-- no, stop it. Wait a minute. Oh! Don't do that. This looks like fun. Yeah, it looks flea-infested to me. Yeah. Am i nervous? Well, no, now that your paintings are here, i think everything's gonna work out fine. It's gonna be great. Yeah? Amanda. Hey. Hi. It looks great. Hi, m.j. it looks fantastic. Oh, my god, you're gonna be so famous. I'm so proud of you. Willie's stuck at the door. The bouncer won't let him in. Bubba won't let him in? No. Ok, i'm gonna take care of it. Hi, ladies. Forrest walrath. I'm 24 years old. I'm a virgo. Uh... i was born in 19... i come here-- i come here a lot. Uh... i do. I really-- bubba. Bubba, uh, listen, this guy's a special visitor... ok, thanks. Thanks, big, uh... uh, bubba. Where's frankie? That's a good question. I'm starting to get worried about her. I don't like the idea of her downtown this late. It's not really safe. Yeah, i know. But she knows what she's doing. She's been doing it for a long time. Look, if you're really worried, you can take my car. Ah-- yeah, i mi-- yeah, i will. Yeah. Thank you. I'll see you later. You gotta stay, because all the guys will be coming down and we'll be going down-- i gotta go. No, come on, please? It'll be live. We'll be jamming. I don't know. Boom box. Noise. Dancing. Hey, what's up? Hey, man, what's up, homes? The mural looks great, ese. Doesn't it look nice? You like the colors? Man, all that work... work, you know? Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a big round of applause to mr. Alexander midnight! When i think about my life, it seems to be composed of random images, all stored in my brain like pictures in a photo album. Often, for no reason at all, i'll think of some lost part of my childhood. The smell of my mother's hair. My dad's big hands, coarse and callused. Lime jell-o in the afternoon. Waah! Lightning bugs in thick glass jars. Aaaahhh... sometimes, if i think hard enough, i can see myself a child again. Aaaahhhh! Aaaahhhhh! When i was about 12, i remember lying awake in my bed on a quiet, dark night, feeling my heart pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, throughout my whole body. For the first time, i understood that someday it would be still. I became petrified, and i stayed awake all night sweating, with my eyes wide, for i knew if i fell asleep, i would die! Whoo! Whoo-hoo. Yeah! Whoo, yeah! I have since come to terms with the fact that i will die. I tell myself that death is just a part of life, and many people have done it before me. Still i wonder, where do we go? From here to there and back again. An entrance into infinite possibilities... ssssss! There are times when i wake up early, perhaps on a saturday morning, with sunlight pouring through the window. And i blink a few times, maybe rub my eyes, and i put my feet on the cool... wood... floor. And i look outside, and i see a slow blur of color and motion, which discriminates into cars and bicycles, young couples with strollers and shopping bags, sea gulls--awk! Awk! Awk! Old men on benches. I drink a cup of cuban coffee and make a list entitled "today." On these mornings, everything is clear and sharp, and i often marvel at how beautifully everything is put together. The laws of physics and chemistry that have somehow interacted to maintain this world. What is your contribution, i ask myself in the mirror? Whoo! I am alone, floating, seeking the rapture of being alive, my mind fragrant with memories. I do not try to figure out where i am going. I simply live my life from day to day and let the strange forces of destiny take me where they may! Look out! I am a happy man. Yeah! All right! Whoo! Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoo-hoo! Boy, did you miss a hell of a show, man. Hey there, buddy, what are you doing sitting in the dark? She's still not back. No call, no message, nothin'. I'm, like, ready to call the police. Relax. They're probably celebrating because they just finished the mural. I wouldn't alert the lapd. That's a long time to celebrate. Well, i wish frankie was here because i have something kind of important to tell everybody. Um... i've been accepted into steppenwolf. Hey, congratulations! Oh, that is so cool. What the hell does that mean? It means i'm moving to chicago january 1st to get back into the theater! Score! Then i can move into your room, bro. Congratulations, honey. Thank you so much. I'm really proud of you. We're gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too. Well, here's to the windy city and to getting the fuck out of los angeles. You know, there's a few things about l.a. you're gonna miss. Yeah, like, uh, not getting a seat at a restaurant unless you've been in the arts and entertainment section recently, like, uh-- trapped on the 405 on friday. Yeah. Like, uh-- meeting new and interesting people who have something to talk about other than film and who's fucking who. Exactly my point. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Let's go party. Let's party. To chicago. No, i don't drink, thank you. That's cool. Great job, alex. I'll be in in a second. Ok? Oh. Hey, minx. Want a cheese and pickle sandwich? Cool it with the beer. Here. Unh. So this is great. I get to move into banks' room. Finally! Willie, you can't move in here. Willie. Sure i can. You are 16 years old. You have to go to high school, and you have to live with dad. Well, maybe i don't want to live with dad. And if you don't want me here, i'll just find someplace else. Sweetie, listen to me, all right? It's not that we don't want you here. Ok? You just gotta slow down a little bit. Besides, dad and sharon want you with them, so-- yeah, right. I think they'd be thrilled if i wasn't there. I mean, you don't--you don't know what it's like. You haven't lived at home for years. Maybe you're right. But you know something, willie? Mama's been dead a long time. And dad, i don't know, he's... he's just trying to live his life. And i understand completely why you are angry at him, but trust me, in time, you will learn to forgive him. I doubt that. I know you're gonna think i'm a queer for saying this. But i love you. And i would absolutely do anything in the world for you. But you can't move in here. Mmm... want some potato chips with your sandwich? No. Ok. There's some pillows and blankets on the couch. You can sleep there tonight. All right?

Is it my imagination or do these guys just blow leaves from one pile to another? What is willie doing in your bed? I really can't believe that a 16-year-old is-- amanda, i didn't sleep with your brother. Bet you can't catch me! Bet you can't catch me! I bet i can! I bet i can! Banks, i need you to make sure all the christmas lights are plugged in. Already done. This is my last cigarette of the year. Good new year's resolution, but according to the paper, out of the last 365 days, the air in l.a. was found unfit to breathe 189 days. That's ridiculous. 189 days? Why would anybody live here? Tell me about it. I think we should all move to bali. That's totally screwed up. Willie, keys. All right, guys, we gotta concentrate, just gotta breathe, just gotta concentrate. Whoa, whoa, whoa. These guys gotta cool out with this party anxiety. Oh! Right here? You want to know the key to my sister's heart? Mm-hmm. Orange marshmallow peanuts. If 75 people don't show up, my reputation's ruined! Trust me, she loves these. I could owe you big on this one, bud. Yes, you could. Yes, you could. Ha ha. How we doin', sweetie? Well, i think this party's a smash as long as more of the hollywood elite show. And you wonder why nobody entertains in l.a. one lousy party and your life can be shattered. Lots of chicks. Oh, you saw backlash. Thanks. Barbara eden really went the distance on that one. Hey, how are you? Alex. Why are you always grinning? Copious amounts of wild sex and fine hallucinogens. So help me god! Having a little trouble, amanda? Come on! Come on! Oh! I didn't invite him. Hey, guys, can i come in? Close the door, already! Oh! My face is crooked. Oh, ok. You worry way too much. I can't believe either one of you told me i have this thing in my teeth. Everyone having fun? Yeah, except the one guy i like. He's more interested in banks. Henry keeps following me around. I'm sorry, henry bugs me. What about you? What about your boyfriend alex? He's not my boyfriend. Nuh-uh. So, frankie, how was the funeral? It was pretty depressing. Uch. It must have been a nightmare. Was it really sad being down there? You know, mario was a real good guy. Yeah, he was. There's so much going on, you guys. I got offered a job, with the van horne foundation in san francisco. San francisco? Frankie, that's great. I don't know. I love my life here, you know? Why should i give this all up? Because it's a career move, an opportunity. Money. Taylor talked you out of it, didn't he? He doesn't even know yet. Come on! Keep your pants on! God! Oh, henry. Hi, henry. Hello, henry. What the hell you suppose they've been doing in there? Women--they have this thing about pissing in packs. Smoking is for the weak. Um, excuse me. I need to borrow them for a minute. We're doing a group photo thing, so... what-- what are you doing? Group photo! Hey, you guys, where's-- m.j.! Aah! M.j.! I'm coming, i'm coming! Whoo! Yes! 1... 2... 3... smile. Thank you! Hey. Want something to drink? I'll have a little bubbly. Whoo... it's wonderful news about frankie. What are you talking about? Her job offer in san francisco. I think she should take it. Could you excuse us for a second? Thanks. Could i talk to you? So what's this about san francisco? You heard. Yeah. I-- i can't believe you haven't said anything to me. I mean, that's-- i was planning on telling you tomorrow when we had time to discuss it. I don't understand. Frankie, are you... do you love me? Yes. I really do. Good, good. That's good. I--i mean... it's good because i've been thinking about all these plans for us. I... i mean, i kind of thought that we would get married. Do you want to marry me? I mean... will you marry me? Yeah? Yeah? Ohh... look at you. You can open up your eyes now. I made this for you. It's called ride 'em, cowboy. Amanda, i love it. Oh, god. Oh... i'm gonna miss you. I'll come visit you. Hey... hey. I like alex. He's great. Yeah? Yeah. He is pretty cool. It's like the two long-lost brothers over here. At least i'm leaving you in good hands. Oh, please. This guy is so cool. He says he's gonna get me a tattoo. No tattoos. I can't wait. First of all, straighten up. Straighten up. Look, like there's-- like there's a string coming from the ceiling. From the sky. That's right. Straighten up. Come on, will, ok? You're very tense. I want to dance at your wedding. Can you believe he asked me to marry him? M.j., i'm so happy. You want to dance, baby, or what? Eew. Later. Ok. I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. Do you think it's possible to find someone to love? You're drunk, and i don't want to hear it. No, it seems that everybody's either getting divorced or fucking around these days. Most of the couples i know, they're miserable, trapped. No. I think marriage is doomed. I really do. You know, you are truly unbelievable. I just asked frankie to marry me and now you're out here talking about divorce. I'm not in the mood for one of your games tonight, m.j. no, taylor. I'm not playing any games. I'm just confused. I don't think i'll ever find anyone to love. I know a hundred guys that are in love with you. Soon as you decide you want someone... yeah, look what happened the last time i thought i found someone. And even if i did find someone, how do i make it work? How do i make it last? Do you really think it's possible to be with one person your whole life? Do you? Yeah. What has it been, 2 months? Let's give this guy a medal! Shut up! And what happens after you're married? You go to a party, and there, sitting right there, is the woman of your dreams. Imagine never having sex with anybody else, never exploring a new body. What do you do? Do you suppress those feelings? I think you come to realize that such... momentary satisfaction doesn't outweigh the pain you cause in someone else. Or your own guilt. You can't suppress those feelings, taylor. You just don't get it, do you? There has been nothing between you and i for months now. At one point i thought maybe i could love you because behind all of your bullshit, there really is this warm, loveable woman. And maybe it's possible to love 2 people at the same time... i don't know, but i made a decision. And in the process, i've fallen in love with frankie, and i'm gonna marry her. Oh. Oh... we had some good times, didn't we, taylor? No. Yeah. But it was just sex, m.j. i mean, i always got the feeling that you thought being with me meant mediocrity. Why am i even talking about this? I'm going back inside. Everything's all fucked up! God, why can't you just be happy for us, huh?! Is that so goddamn hard for you? It-- it really doesn't matter. It's all over with now. You know, the only times i've ever felt safe is when i'm having sex. I felt that way with you, you know. Like i could block out all the other shit, and then he took even that away from me! You know how terrible everyone felt when that happened to you. Deep down inside, i know how you guys felt, that i brought everything on me. M.j., that's not true. Sometimes i think... that i really did love you, and that i still do. What are you doin', huh? I'm not gonna fall for this. You don't really want me, m.j. you just want to know you can have me. Then why do i want to kiss you so badly? Ugh. You think we should go pry my brother off that poor girl's face? Ah! Where'd you get these? Mmm. I can't believe you actually eat these things. Mmm, tasty. Right? Do you know many muscles there are in the trunk of an elephant? No. 100,000. Liar! On my mother's eye. Oh. Merci, beaucoup. I love the way you look right before i kiss you. Happy new year. Ah! M.j.! God! Why are you here? I know you want it. What does it take to get through to you, huh? Come on! M.j., don't do this. Please don't do this. Excuse me. Has anyone seen taylor? It's almost midnight, right? Yeah, no. No, i haven't seen him lately. Oh. Ok, everybody, it's almost midnight! Ready?! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2-- come on. One! Oh, my god! Oh, shit! Frankie, wait, wait! Frankie, please! What's going on here? Frankie! Frankie! You know what, amanda, i'm really sick of you! Well, fine! Be sick! I don't give a shit! You guys, you guys, i'm sick of both of you. Please? My plane leaves in 4 hours. Can't we just... pretend to get along for a little while? Taylor, what happened? Did you guys find her? Talk to me! Hello! Taylor! No, we didn't find her anywhere. This is really not good. No, this is really fucked up. But, you know, you really can't blame the girl for not wanting to be here. Boy, that really helps, amanda. That really helps, especially coming from you sitting on your ass. Oh, fuck you! She's out there all alone! She is all alone! Frankie, frankie will be here when she'll be here. Now, i think we should all just take a look at the anxiety flying around this room. Darling? Yes? I'm gonna go upstairs and have a relax. You wanna come? No. Frankie... frankie, let me explain. There's nothing to say. No, just listen to me. Get your hands off of me. No. Get your hands off of me! No! Not until you-- get your fuckin' hands off of me! Ow! You're hurting me! All right, i just want to explain to you what-- aah! Have you ever thought about anyone else beside yourself? God, for all these years, i have put up with so much bullshit! I'm such an idiot. Ok, m.j., now you're gonna tell her what happened. God damn it, you tell her what i said to you in that room now! He, um... he told me that-- that he didn't love me. That he loved you. I was the one that climbed into bed with him. I wasn't invited. And it--it never happened before? Oh, god! Oh, god, you both are so fucked up! You really deserve each other. I--i need help! Please! I need you. I used to think that was important, that people needed me. And look what i have to show for it.
