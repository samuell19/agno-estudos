Ann, Linda, hats. -Sorry Mrs. Philips. -Sorry Mrs. Philips. Got to do geography, can't do it on my own. Okay I'll try and get dad to drop me off. Is your mom at home? I don't know, but come along about six thirty. Okay. Do you know what she said today? What? She asked if Hitler was the one with the moustache. God, that's ridiculous. Even I know that and I'm completely thick. Hi. Hi. Oh my God, look at that for movement. Ann really fancies you, Lawrence. Stupid, bloody idiot. Oh, he didn't hear you don't worry. What do you mean, he couldn't exactly not have heard, could he? See you here, Thursday, four o'clock? I'm Dr. Kramer She's in the living room. I'm going to get through to her. Hey, what's going on? Go home now, there's nothing here to see. Quiet, is it PG or something? Wonder what that was about. Cat died. Ann. Ann Come on. Ann, come back Come on. No. Female has extensive damage to the cranium and associated distortion of the facial features. Probable cause, a blunt instrument, perhaps several blows. There is evidence of CSF fluid and multiple blood loss from the intercranial injury. How long has she been dead? Oh, less than an hour I'd say. All right, all right, what's with all the hurry, slow down, slow down. Come on Gordon I am her father. I'm sorry Norman you can't go in there. And you can't interview her without me. You have no right to keep me from her. I demand to see that inspector now. Your daughter's fine, as soon as the DI's finished talking to her, you can take her home. I want to go into that house. I want to see the officer in charge. I'm the officer in charge, no one goes into that house. I'm inspector Gates. This is detective Sergeant Black, and there's nothing to be frightened of Ann, but we must try and put things back as they were before you knocked them over. Come on sir, you can't stay here, we're trying to conduct a murder investigation You think you can help us do that? I might, if I had a cigarette. -Thanks. -Those things could kill you. So could he. What can you remember? Kitchen, drawers pulled out, table cloth hanging. Floor, knives, forks, broken cup, canister, silver, silver colour, bits of paper, coupons. Then the whole phone was pulled out. I don't remember anything else. Did you drink the milk? Portland central training board. Did he drink it? Aren't you gonna arrest me? And protect you from him? No chance. I have an important position at this town. Oh, have you change your job then? Being manager of the Downshire building society is a prominent and exposed position. And I can't afford to be the father of a daughter who keeps getting up to such bloody stupid escapades, and this one, this one words fail me. I wish they would. Stop it she's been punished enough. Either I'm crazy Eileen or you are. She hasn't been punished at all. That's the trouble, well I'll punish her. Do you hear me Ann, you're gonna stop this stupidity, or I'm gonna stop paying the fees for that expensive school. Great, I never wants to go to the snotty hole in the first place and you couldn't afford it, if I wasn't in assisted place. Will you stop it, the both of you. The murder has been linked to a number of break-ins all in the area Jenna's Wood. After a previous serious assault, the police expressed fears only last week that the intruder might strike again. It appears that 52 year old Lucy Travis, disturbed him and he savagely assaulted her. He then got away by motorbike through the wood behind the... If you don't get in there and put you pyjamas on I'm gonna call your dad. Hey, what's this, not in bed yet. Now look young man, you're not the one suffering from shock but you will be if I catch you. Shh, pipe down, she's trying to sleep. Come on young man, I'm going to tell you a story and then you're going to sleep. But I don't feel sleepy. Oh pooch, I haven't seen you for awhile. Night night pet, sleep tight. Jenna's Wood is strictly out of bounds. You must leave the school in pairs taking the main road only. Girls chosen for the swimming pool appeal reception this evening must arrange to be accompanied home by an adult. I understand you're writing the definitive English text book. God, look who it is. Would you like a canape? Yeah. Do you have a publisher? No. So you'll still need to teach. I have a job here, if you're interested. Mrs. Phillips is going on maternity leave and I need someone to cover for her. Excuse me. Thank you Ms. Montrose. He has given up teaching, Haven't you David? It's only temporary Val, helping out. Given up? He was stabbed. He was in hospital for three months. The school was in a London bin. The idea is to stimulate the book, not stop it. Canape Ms. Montrose? Thank you. These ones are particularly good. -Thank you. -Thank you. I didn't think you'd come. Lots of girl I know wouldn't. I'm not lots of girls and you don't know me. I know your name and where you live. So what are you gonna be when you grow up, private detective? You're a bit quick aren't you? No, I'm not. I'm not quick at all, that's the trouble, I'm 17. Oh, I see. Get off me, will you ? She said you fancied me. Fancy you? You're the sort of nice boy my mother would like me to bring home to tea. You don't turn me on like that. Well, how will I turn you on? I never asked anyone before. Would you like to come to tea? Well, that's the sort of thing I do with Jesseme. Who's Jesseme? Your girlfriend? No, well sort of. She's a family friend. Do you grope Jesseme? No, you don't grope Jesseme. You don't grope Jesseme, but you grope me? Well, I didn't mean... What else does it mean? You do do it. Oh that's it, is it? That's what they told you on the bike sheds, is it? That's what you came for? That's all you're interested in, is it? No, Ann. Come on then, if that's what you want. Wait, I've got a thing. I can feel it. You've got something. It's my period you stupid wanker. Can I clean your car? Fiver, wash and Polish? Told you, told you. When he could clean the car, but you can't because I'm going out. Again? Stoke Priam, those mortgages. Here, that's an advance, two washes. Last time I washed the car, you didn't give me a fiver. Thanks dad. Hey! Hey! It all right. It all right. It's me, It's DS Black. It's all right. Hey Holly. What? It's Ann. What on earth has she done now? She's being arrested. This is a murder inquiry, Ann. Were you meeting someone? No. Why were you there? How much pocket money do you get a week? Three pounds. What's that got to do with it? Is this yours? Yeah. Where did you get it? It fell out of your pocket in the wood. There's 28 pounds, 15 pence. How did you come to have so much, Ann? What'd you mean? You think I did it? No. You think he was the thief and I was helping him? Who? Who did you meet in the wood? No one. Just a boy. Tell the inspector his name? Lawrence, Lawrence Churchman. The magistrate's son? Lives at the lodge? Please don't ask him, please. He'll never talk to me again. I borrowed the money from my parents, from Linda, I even sold my getup blouse to my brother to buy Lawrence, a new bicycle wheel. We quarrelled, I broke it, please. I'm not a thief. What is it, Ann? I do some stupid things, but I swear I've never stolen anything in my life. What was it like? A piece of string in a bucket. How was yours? Ann, you never gave me your phone number. Oh yeah. Great, thanks. See you then. What did you do a stupid thing like that for? -What? -Give him your number. I didn't, I gave him yours. Ann, it's your dad's car ain't it? We could ask him for lift. Yeah, great idea, let's do that. Ann. Come on. Did he see you? No, maybe I dunno. Oh my god Linda, I don't know. What am I gonna tell my mother? Your mother? I've got to tell her about it. I'll be deceiving her as well if I don't. Where have you been? Linda's Well, you weren't there when I called. Must've just left. What do you want to drink? Gin tea, ice, hold the lemon. I went to Stoke. I know, it's written all over your face. I told you not to go there. What's happened. What is it, Pen? Nothing. Why are you so upset? I'm not upset. Yes you are. For God's sake, mother, I know when I'm upset and when I'm not upset, and I'm not upset. There you go. I can't eat that mother. Get it down, you need it with what you get up to. You were in Stoke Prior last night, I hear. I had to tell him Pen I'm sorry, but I've been so worried about you. What on earth are you apologising for. So that's why you've cooked this, you feel guilty. Guilty, you're the one who should feel guilty. You told us you were at Linda's last night, you deceived us. Now eat that food your mother's cooked for you. What's Icelandic for comeback. I don't know Ben, what is Icelandic for comeback? Jojo. Is it really? See you learn something new every day, Eileen. I saw you in jokers. You were in the pub. Drinking? No, I saw his car, that's why I went in. Eat your breakfast. You were spying on me. I see what you're thinking. I was with Mrs. Hedges from Collins and Denton. You were kissing her. Ann. He was. Damn right I was kissing her, after she sewed up all those mortgages for me. It wasn't that sort of kiss. Shut up. There's an evil, wicked streak in you Ann Devenish. Just because you've been caught out, you're trying to turn on your father. I've been caught out? That's enough, now finish your breakfast. You finish it. Stop it! Stop it! I'll kill you! I'll kill you. Ainlee and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening 'till peace was restored, then both began such and their father's pockets for the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of 14, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great coat, he blubbered aloud. And Kathy, when she learned that the master had lost her whip attending on the stranger, showed her humour by grinning, earning for her pain, the sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manners. They entirely refused to have it in bed with them or even in their room, and I had no most sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs hoping it might be gone on the morrow. By chance or else attracted by hearing his voice... Somebody in there? Ms. Wood, I have to fix one of the lockers, would you mind seeing if the coast is clear. They should all be in class. I thought I smelled cigarette smoke. I'm sure I heard somebody. Why is this window open? Well it was shut five minutes ago, I walked past here on my way in. I'll tell Ms. Montrose, and make sure that window is secured. What's going on? There was a murderer in school. Oh my god. He got injured revision. Where? Through the plate room window, next to our classroom. Mr. Rayland is positive he saw a man running into those trees shortly after we found the open window. The girl said she had 20 pounds in a cash card. Sir, I just thought I'd let you know, I haven't seen Ann since lunchtime. Hi dad. Hello Ben, just get your own breakfast, will you? Any news? There's been another murder. Where? The Stoke prior side of the woods. Woman had her head battered, like the last one. We moved here because of that, wood, it was so beautiful. Now I can't even look at it. It took me ages to get through to the police again. They want a photograph of her. There's a much nicer one of her. Morning, Norman. Morning. Excuse me! Ann? Oh darling, we were so worried. Where have you been? You're all right, Ann. There was a click in my head. I was frightened. Where have you been for the last three days? I don't know. And what were you doing outside of the Travis' house? Could I have a cigarette please? You don't smoke. No I don't mum, but he gave me one last time. What happened to the clothes you were wearing, Ann? We don't know where they came from. You should've seen her. Where are they? He wants to find out if there's any blood on them. Don't you? You don't think... I don't think anything Mrs. Devenish, but there's been a second murder, only a few miles from the first, and we simply have to account for people's movements. Jesus Christ. Worried about the effect it will have on his mortgages. Where are the clothes? In the washing machine. Some second guess to entertain and he that digs it spies, a bracelet, bright hair about the bone. Will he not let us alone and think there a loving couple lies. Who thought that this device might be some way to make their souls the last busy day, meet at this grave and make a little stay. If this ball in a time, or land where miss devotion, death command, then he that digs us up will bring us to the bishop and the king and make us relics. Then thou shall be a Mary Magdalen and I, a something else, thereby. Now that, lovely ambiguous tone. You see, John Donne was famously, what is known as a dualist. He was both a passionately devout Catholic and a celebrator of carnal love. Are you with us Ann? Not for very much longer Mr. Miles. I'm leaving at the end of this term. Well, better make the most of it then hadn't you. So, even at the last busy day, what does Donne mean by that? The resurrection? Yes, resurrection. The day when all the souls rise up, looking for their bodies, you know, arm here, leg there. But you see even then, Donne has his relic, his charm, his bracelet of bright hair, about the bone. So that even at the last busy day, we can meet at this grave and make a little stay. What might he mean by that Make love. Yes, that's right Melissa, make love. Could you write me an essay about your feelings. In the front rooms, the men were bending over a woman, her knees were drawn up as if she was asleep. Then one of the men moved away and I saw she had no face. Only an eye was staring at me from a mess of blood and bone. Your essay is about the murder Ann, rather than the poem It's terribly vivid. Do you think you might have an idea who's responsible for the murder? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know, Ann? You don't know who, you know, that's all I mean sir. Anyway, I'm leaving, so there's no need for you to bother about that rubbish. I know I can't write about love, like Melissa, sir. All right, hand these out, will you? Oh, sorry sir. All right. Got them? Yes sir, thank you sir. Go on then. And Ann. Yes sir? It's not rubbish. It's a remarkable piece of writing. Well, well, well. Well, well, well, well, well. Do you want to know what Mr. Miles said to Ms. Montrose about you? Remarkable mind? Outstanding was the word he used Eileen, get it right. Well whatever it was, I went so red. I flushed all over. Highly creative imagination, but we know all about that and do we Eileen. Hello, earth calling Ann. Leave her alone, let her relax. She's had a terrible time, but now it's settled, thank God. What's settled? You're gonna stay on. I am not. I'm going to Stoke Comprehensive. Now look. Norman, you know what we agreed. What did you agree? That you should decide. That you should go where you feel happiest. Oh yes, my bank balance will certainly be happier. You're only making the biggest mistake you'll ever make in your life. But so long as you're happy, that's the main thing. Hello, Norman Devinish. Hello Mr. Miles. Yes, I'll just see if Ann's here. Hello? Hello it's David Miles here. I just finished reading you last essay, and I had to ring you, it's brilliant. Thank you, I don't know what to say. Give it to me, give it to me. That was my brother, you was gone on Miles, it's Melissa. And a small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry. So what are we gonna do tonight. Hold your noise, quite a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch, "Keep still you little devil or I'll cut your throat." Ann go to your seat. I found it on the floor sir. We'll continue reading where I left off. Thank you. What's up with him? -You know, -You know he was stabbed. She looks like a witch. I always thought you were mad. Why don't you leave like you said you would? What did you think you were doing? Don't worry, you don't have to go back, you'll to be able to get on with the book. Hello Ann. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's all right Ann, come in. Is that what you wanted? Is that an explanation of what happened at school this afternoon? Because you were frightened of staying. Because you were frightened of your gift. Oh yes, yes Ann, you have the most precious gift in the world, talent. Hey, don't you realise how talented that vicious little performance was? Don't you realise what you could if you controlled it, instead of it controlling you? Okay I'll be there at six, bye. Jump at the chance to get rid of you. It's such a waste, stupid, stupid waste. I'll take care of it. You forget it. Be true only to your talent Ann. Lie only to the examiners who have none. You keep what you really think to yourself. Tell teachers and lecturers only what they want to hear. And in the future, you're can do anything. You can be anything. Katy, Louisa, hats. -Sorry, Ms. Devenish. -Sorry, Ms. Devenish. I really never expected to be passing first time. Well done, you only had two minor faults of observation. Must be checking that rear view mirror all the time. You might think about lessons for motorway driving, very different kettle of fish from Manchester high street. Ann. Lawrence, how are you? So you'll need these. -Thank you. -Thank you very much. I just passed my driving test. Well done. Well you should celebrate. Would you like to come to tea? Why not? I still got it. I should hope so. No, the bike wheel, it's on my wall. A sort of sculpture. Well, it's as good as anything. Better, I know what it means. What do you call it? Jenna's Wood. They never caught him, did they? No. So what is this place? Somebody's weekend cottage. I clean it for them. Easy money they're never there. Can I see you again? I've got so much to do, A-levels next year. You can teach me to drive. Okay, you're under age though. Only just. Hello? Mr. Meisters, hello! Hello? Ann, I was wondering what happened to you. Hi mom. You're very late. I know, I'm sorry, but I met someone and I've still got this place to clean up. Mr. Meister told me it wasn't gonna be here, but he must've changed his mind or lent the place to someone. Supper will be ready at seven. Okay, I'll see you in about half an hour. Bye. You do sound very like Monte. Touch more of the acid smile. Excellent, Mr Miles, you have my full permission to proceed with those reservations. Good. Lawrence. Mr. Miles, Lawrence Churchman, Lawrence, Mr. Miles. -Hello Lawrence. -Pleased to meet you. Oh I'm so sorry. It's all right I've got it. Mrs. Miles is rather lucky tonight, that's a very good year. Tell me, do you think it's better to decant the wine before serving it. No Melissa, I tend to drink wine straight from the bottle. All right, that's enough everybody thank you very much. Sir, I was going to ask you about the poem. Ann. Can you pull over and let me have a drive. All right, but I have to be with you. Please let have a go on my own. No way. Ann! Only down to the village and back. Ann, that's so bloody stupid. Hello, Christine Dobson. Hello? Christine, Christine! David, what's happened? It's Valerie, Valarie's dead. She's been killed. Where the hell have you been? I've had an accident. What have you done to the car? Get in! Ann, you're going too fast. Look, you've done enough damage for one day, to yourself and the car. Stop and let me drive. What's wrong with you? Slow down. Oh Christ all mighty. Are you mad Ann? Do you want them to pick us up? Don't stop, carry on. Ann, what are you doing? Get back in the car, Ann! What have I done? He shoved her over, then finished her up with a poker. Milk bottle, phone wire cut, it's him. Any sign of bike tracks. No he used a car this time, but he might have had a bit of an accident. Any chance of forensics being done in under two months? Any chance of them doing it period, sir. We've come the end of our budget. Put a priority on it. I'm sorry Mr. Miles, but since you found your wife, we're gonna ask you to come with us and change your clothing. You might have picked up hairs, fibre. Check the windows and the doors. Nothing, no sign of forcible entry. He must've opened the door too. Or he had a key. Sir, we're gonna have to do this down the station, sir. Oh, I see. But he moved her first, why would he do that? Whoever did this would have to be covered in blood, I mean covered in it. Make sure you get a good shot of the side of her face. Andy, get him out of here. It is Jenna, isn't it? You're sure about the time Mr. Miles drove in. Quite sure, I saw his car, a minute or two later, he came running over. No more than that? Two minutes On the outside. Thank you, Ms. Dobson. I'll send someone in to take the formal statement. Praise my soul the King of Heaven; To his feet thy tribute bring. Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, All like me his praises sing: Praise Him, praise Him Praise Him, praise Him, Praise the everlasting King. Praise Him for His grace and favour. I think it's actually about the worst thing you could possibly be doing. Ann, why are you doing this? Hello, Detective Sergeant Black, is it? Yeah. You probably don't remember me. Ann Devenish. Hi, nice to see you. What are you doing here? I've come to see inspector Gate, if he's around. Oh yeah, you phoned didn't you. I'll take you up, he's expecting you. I was in Staunton that night, you see. Well of course you saw me. What were doing at Staunton that night, Ann? We went out for a drive. We? I was with my boyfriend, Lawrence. The young man who brought you here? We saw the police cars and I had an awful feeling. How do you think you can help us, Ann? I was in the area. Are you all right? No, I'm not, I'm sorry. Get some water. Migraine, comes out to the blue. Thank you. Ann, how did you get that bruise? Ann? Breaking the law, not wearing a seatbelt. Lawrence had to brake suddenly when a rabbit shot out. You were saying you were in the area. Yes, I was with Lawrence. I keep seeing that house, that poor woman. Everything gets so confused, so muddled. Ann, I know it was a terrible sight, but that was some time ago now, and you really should try and put it out of your head. I will. I will, thank you. I'm sorry I took so much of your time. You were right to come in. Ann, it's good to see you again, looking so different. Would you ask your boyfriend if he'd see me? Of course. What did you tell him? Oh, I couldn't tell him that you were driving, could I? Don't please. Do you know what you've done? I've never told a lie in my life, not like that. My mother is a magistrate. What did you say? That we were having a passionate time in the picnic area. I'm not laughing. Neither am I. Oh, poor Lawrence. And what was that stupid stuff about braking for a rabbit? It was you that did that. -Stop it! -Stop it! That damage is gonna cost hundreds of pounds. Well, you can stick it on your wall with the bicycle wheel then. Oh Lawrence, I do need you. It's too soon after that horrible thing. It wouldn't be right. He's only your bloody teacher. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know how much he means to you, but my head hurts... Haven't you forgotten something? Oh my God, that would be terrible. It's just not done, is it? The worst of crimes. Drive. You're in first. Keep cool, nobody's going to arrest you. So long as you go out with a magistrate's son, speak like Monte and wear the right hat, you can get away with murder. Watch the road! He's too fat to have done it. Well, whoever it was, it took them long enough to get here. Ann, they've got Jenna, they've arrested a man for the murders. Have you heard? Well, now we can open the forbidden window. Do you remember that day? It was awful. What a relief to think he's no longer out there. We don't have to constantly be looking over our shoulders. 'Cause we only know if they've found the right one. Don't be so pathetic of course they've found the right one. Ann are you coming? In a minute. Come on let's go. You're going to come to mine, tonight. Yeah but I got to do some work. Why do you go around with them, Ann? Look, why don't we go out like we used to? To Stoke. I'm seeing Lawrence tonight. Lawrence, isn't that a pain. Hey, where did you get this from? I found it in the cottage where I clean. Look, it's mine, I chew the cap. And you've been using it? I wouldn't use that disgusting colour. Well someone has, look. Didn't you know you'd nick it? Oh, God, have they started again, the blackouts? Don't be so stupid, the pills have cured all that. Well, at least we know they've caught him, murdering bastard. My mother knows him. She knows him? He means as a magistrate, Eileen. She gave him nine months for assault and he was boasting about the murders in prison. That's how they got him. He was a poacher. He used those woods before they took away his gun licence. That's how it all started. Thank God it's over. It's not over until I get a conviction Eileen. They found the stuff in the first two murders in his house, but then... Hold on, what's this then? I'm so sorry, it's all my fault. We've been celebrating. Celebrating. Have you been abducting my daughter, Mr. Miles? I'm afraid I have Mr. Devenish. Yes, I ran into her and in front of the George. She told me that they found the man who murdered my wife. But they haven't. My mother told me. He's confessed to the other two murders, but not killing your wife. But it must be the same man. Of course it is. Come on Lawrence, we'll just make the film. Bye Pen, have a nice time. One for the road, Mr. Miles? No, I better not, thank you. Bye, thank you for the drink. Linda, hi it's Lawrence. Do you have any idea where Ann might be? You haven't seen her? She might be at the cottage though. Oh okay, yeah I'll try that. Okay, thanks bye. What are you doing here? I've been looking everywhere for you. You're spying on me, aren't you? Ann, I've got to talk to you. Go away! -Something's happened. -Piss off! I've got to talk to you. Hello. Hi, my darling it's me, how are you? I'm all right. What's the matter? What's the matter? What's wrong? What's wrong? You just told me to piss off and you're asking me what's wrong? When? What are you talking about? Ann, I have to see you now. Lawrence, what's happened. Gates came to see me. What did you tell him? Nothing, just the stupid story about the rabbit. You were at the Miles's house that evening weren't you? No. Don't lie to me Ann. Gates knows the car was there. How? The dent, you drove into the post outside the house, didn't you? Ann, for God's sake, here sit down. I don't know if I'm remembering or imagining. Imagining, imagining what? I love you Ann. I just love you and I don't care what's happened, whatever you've done, because I think you're the most wonderful person in the whole world. Please don't say that Lawrence. Please don't say that kind of crap. It's not crap, Ann, I mean it. I know you mean it, but you must stop meaning it. I'm not wonderful. No, please. What were you doing there Ann? What were you doing at Miles's house? I don't know, I can't remember. But it's something to do with Miles, isn't it? With you and Miles. I saw him going to the cottage. There's something going on between you, isn't it? Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Isn't she up yet? No, she was up and down in the night, sick. Excitement, first night. I'll do like an impresario myself after taking a double page spread in the school programme. Mom, mom, she's murdered her teddy bear. Ann, what's the matter? Where's the brouche? What brouche? That's how it all started. Where did she put it? She? Anne with an E. Ann. Let me go. What's the matter with her? Go Ben, just get ready for school. What's happening. Just go. What's going on. Do you remember when Ann used to talk to her teddy about her friend, Ann with an E. Oh for god's sake Eileen, that was years ago. All kids do that. I asked her to introduce us and she said, "No, you wouldn't like her. "She's bad." They got him. Yes. You know? Yes, I told you they'd get the murderer. Didn't I tell you? Jenna. Jenna. Here a loving couple lies. Who would've thought that this device might be some way. To make their souls the last busy day. -Meet at this grave. -At this grave. -And make a little stay. -And make a little stay. Where did you get all that, Pet. She stole them. She? She? I'm not having any of this, Ann with an E, rubbish. You stole them. She didn't know what she was doing. What are you're talking about? Of course he knew what she was doing, didn't you? Not always. The most expensive education money can buy and you turn into a thief. Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have to get rid of this lot. I mean, return them anonymously. That's what David Miles did before you began fucking me. Don't use that word. For god's sake mother it's not the word you should be worried about. We did it in the cottage. He's been fucking me for over six months. Call the school, tell them she's not well. Oh, hello, Mr. Devenish. I'm terribly sorry to drop in on announced like this. But we get to be in a bit of a spot tonight, if Ann can't do the show. Yeah, I'm afraid Ann's asleep at the moment. Right then, you better come in. Thank you. Is Ann all right? Not too good, I'm afraid. Hello, Mrs. Devenish. What's the matter. -She's been a bit odd. -Disturbed. -Saying some funny things. -Filthy things. Norman. Well, I've got to tell a man what she's been saying about him Eileen. Right, I see. I think I can guess. It's an occupational hazard, I'm afraid. It's my fault, my fault entirely. I must have been spending too much time with her, putting her under too much pressure. There's no truth in it then? I'm sorry you feel you have to ask that Mr. Devenish. If you knew as much about teenage fantasies as I do. I do, believe me, I do. I told you so. She hasn't been taking her pills. Mr. Miles, that's what this is all about. Right, well I better make a move. Got to do something about this show tonight. Hello Ann. I'm sorry. It's all right. I'm sure we'll be able to work something out without you. It's such a shame though. If only you could have seen her doing Ms Montrose, devastating. Are you sure you're not up to it, Pet? Would you just give me a couple of moments with her? Thank you. Why don't you pop the kettle. I killed her, didn't I? Come here. You haven't told them, have you? No. You must say nothing, absolutely nothing. You found me there, didn't you? You don't remember that? I couldn't remember crushing the car. It's only a matter of time before they find out what really happened. Kiss me. I want to be with you always. I'd rather die than be without you. I think you're gonna want to come a little more downstage for this. I know that some of you girls think that I'm quite strict in my views. No Ann, try unnecessarily harsh. I know that some of you girls feel that I'm unnecessarily harsh in my views, on your conduct. Very good, really terrific. It's pure Ms. Montrose. She's going to be a real star tonight. And the temperament to go with it. Norman stop it. You're having an affair with her, aren't you? Go away Lawrence. That's why you're protecting her, isn't it? What on earth are you talking about? She was at your house that night, the night your wife was murdered. I drove back and I found my wife dead on the floor. That is what I found. Now I've been trying to help Ann with the show tonight, she's not particularly well and you're only making things a hundred times worse. Look, Lawrence, she doesn't want to see you anymore, but she can't find a way of telling you. Don't you realise that? I'm sorry if that's cruel, but I had to say it for her sake, and yours. All right? All right. Oh, Lawrence, for god's sake, watch where you're going. I'm so sorry. Lawrence what are you doing here? I'm sorry to be such a nuisance. Lawrence, you're never a nuisance. Aren't I? Of course you're not. I wanted to give you a card. Break a leg or whatever. Oh Lawrence. What is it Ann? What is it? Go on, get out. Thank you so much. It has indeed been an eventful year, but I feel that no review of its highlights would be quite complete without mentioning, Melissa Barnett and Holly, Who took part in the inter-school debating competition on the subject of, "Is sex really necessary?" Their research was enthusiastically aided by the Ashmints college for boys. To who we all owe our most profound thanks. Never did two girls, more richly deserve their prize. The lower fifth went on the school ski trip to San Lorenz. Under the experienced guidance of Mr. Robbins, all previous records were broken, five virginities, two pregnancies, and an elopement. Mr. Robbins, needless to say, has not been seen since, which has been a cause of great personal disappointment to me. And me too. I know that some of you girls feel that I have an unnecessarily harsh view of your conduct. Such is not the case. To show how liberal the Centre of excellence is, I'm proud to present you, The creme de la creme of Bishop Griffiths school. I hope that you enjoy the rest of your evening. Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats please. The second half of tonight's review, commences in three minutes. Ann, open up, Ann. Ann, come on Ann. Are you in there? You're on again in five minutes. Ann, please, gotta get in and change for my next song. All right, what's going on? Ann's locked herself in, Mr. Miles. Ann, Ann open the door. Ann. Look, the window's opened. She wouldn't go out in the night like this. What on earth is going on? And she was a bit weird before curtain call. Let's see if we can find her clothes. But she hasn't changed, she might still be inside. Girls, stop spinning about concentrate. Who was the last person to see Ann? She was coming off when I came on. She said something a bit strange. What did she say? She said goodbye. Why would she say that? Oh god, I knew it, I knew she was getting those blackouts again. I'm sure it's nothing serious. We all know Ann is highly strong, now come on girls, get back to the theatre, the show must go on. I'll go and tell Ms. Montrose. She hasn't done anything stupid, has she? She wouldn't. Well, she was fantastic tonight. Ann. Ann. Ann. Ann. What did she say in the note? Do you have a key? Why the hell would I have a key? Well, you come here, I've seen you. What did she say note? I think she came here to kill herself. I told you this afternoon, she was on the edge. You left before the interval, the bonnet of your car was warm. Leave the detective work to Gates, Lawrence. Why don't you go around the back, and see if you can get in there. Did she not give you a key? You're wasting time. Let me see. Don't be so stupid. Come on. Ann. Ann. I killed Valerie Miles. That's all you want to know, isn't it? How do you know? How do I know? That you killed her? That's a stupid question. You have memory blackouts. You're not sure what you did, are you? You don't believe that rubbish, do you? Yes I do. And so did Miles. Then when you started remembering you became too great a problem. I don't know what you're on about. I hit her on the head, I did it. Is that what he told you? Miles? Ann, we can help you to remember. I don't want to remember. Can't you understand? I don't want to remember. Inspector. All right, Mrs. Devenish. We'll leave it then, but we'll need to speak to her again, in a couple of days. You took Ann Devenish to the cottage, didn't you? No, I was at school the whole time, ask anyone. You came in wet at the interval. Yes. I'd made several trips to an outside prop store. A witnesses says your car had been driven. Lawrence? It's teenage fantasy. He's out of his mind with adolescent jealousy. Why? Jealousy isn't logical. I've been spending a lot of time with Ann. I was directing her in the show. Do you remember Lucinda Grey? Yes, of course. She killed herself. She's very bright, very talented. It was awful. Did you have an affair with her? No. Why didn't your wife want you to teach again? Because I'd been stabbed. By her boyfriend. More teenage fantasy. Why did you follow Lawrence to the cottage? I'd seen Lawrence read a note from Ann, I was very worried about her, and I followed him. Why didn't you unlock the door? You had the key in your pocket. I didn't realise that. You didn't realise it? I had a lot of keys in my pocket. Most of the girls were giving me valuables of one kind or another to look after that night. He's done it before, Miles. A girl at his last school, only she was successful in killing herself You're making this up. At least that was the verdict. Her boyfriend accused miles of killing her, but it was a tearaway against the respected teacher, so of course, no one believed him, which is why he stabbed Miles. You see if it works, people tend to follow the same pattern. I mean, did he tell you he was gonna kill himself as well. No. A suicide pact, is that what it was? No, no you're lying, you're lying! I don't know who killed Valerie Miles, Ann, but David Miles tried to kill you. Now you've got to try and remember what happened the day Valerie was killed. I can't do this. Jeez, let's go back. She found out, didn't she? Valerie. Just before leaving on a business trip. She was threatening to tell Monte, when she returned. He said he didn't care so long as were together. Then the night she was due back, dear sweet Lawrence came to pick me up from school. He knocked over Mr. Mile's shopping. And there it was, the same meal, same bottle that we used to drink together. I knew then he wasn't going to leave her. That's why I took the car that night. Only down to the village and back. So he could be free of her and I could be free of the other bitch. The other bitch? Anne, thank goodness for all the hard work and her migraine. Parked here. She was in her kitchen, when I went out the drive. I want you to leave at the end of this term. For god's sake I'll stop. -You won't. -I will. You can't stop. I'll be leaving at the end of the year. What difference does that make? Come in Ann. We were just talking about you. I thought you might be, we've often talked about you. Then he's told you he's done this before. No, but I'm not at all surprised. Well, you will be. Oh shut up, both of you. You're mad, coming here. This is finished Ann, it's over. I mean it. I'll phone Monte now. Don't be so stupid. Let her, let her phone her. Let me through please. Don't you understand what that would mean? Of course I understand. I should have done this last time. Tell her, tell her what happened. I don't care what happened. I don't care. I don't care. Hello, it's Valerie Miles. Yes I'd like to speak to Ms. Montrose. No it's urgent. Valerie stop that. Put it down. Don't you touch me? Put that bloody phone down. Let me go. Is she dead? I don't know. I don't know. Ann. Don't touch me. Undress. Undress! In here! Leave your clothes, wash and change. Give me that shirt. You'll have to. It's what he does. Well come on! Give it to me. The woman next door, did she see you drive in? No, I don't think so. Get Lawrence's car, I parked it further down the road. -Drive in here. -In here? His car looks like your car. She'll think you just got back. Well go on, go on, just do it. Was she still in her kitchen? Yes. Phone her. What? Just phone her and don't say anything, and dial 141 first. Give me 15 seconds and then cut the wires. What? It's what he does. Reverse, you stupid bastard. Are you all right? Go, go, go, go, go. Christine. Christine. Christine! What have you done to the car. Get in. And where the hell have you been. I've had an accident. Quite a performance. Is that what you think? It's what the court will think. Where's the evidence? What does she do with his clothes? No jury will ever believe her. The clothes were in the boot of Lawrence's car when you came back here, weren't they Ann? Did you take her straight home, Lawrence? She said she needed a walk. I dropped her at the edge of the wood. I loved him. When my grave is broke up again, some second guessed to entertain and he that digs it, spies a bracelet of bright hair about the bone. Will they not left us alone and think... Here a loving couple lies. Who would've thought that this device might be some way. To make their souls the last busy day. Meet at this grave. And make our little stay.
