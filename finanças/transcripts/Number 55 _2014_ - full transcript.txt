NUMBER 55 What's that? A croatian tank. Oh, fuck. You are from Bjelovar? Yes. "A" Company. How many? Twenty, but not all armed. Never mind. I see you have a tank. And what? Nothing, it's great. Commander want's to see you. Let's go. See this... Cunts... Hick, learn how to drive. Oh, ladies! So you decided to show? We heard you we're fucked, so we came. You heard right. You know each other? Of course! The pride of Bjelovar Police. Fuck you. We know you we're working inside, OK. Let's go see the boss. Tomo, I want everyone unloaded and ready. Looks like we're moving on. OK. When they press on the two sides, we need to retreat them from the flanks. And then we are completely exposed on the northeast side. We need to close that up ASAP. Here we have the bunkers dug up during the summer. They can't get us out there. And we need men in the city. On this side. And here on the road? Chetniks are in this village. Don't know how many and what they are planning. They haven't moved since they placed the barricades. Have you tried firing something on their positions? We don't have anything. We're barely holding this. They have bigger guns. We're on the defensive. What is shitting about my armored car? Ah, fuck him. You just polish it. Make it shine. Do you have any idea where we are being sent? Probably up on the Calvary. We have bunkers on the front. Yeah, waiting for them to get us. Don't fuck with me. They're supplied by the JNA (Yugoslav Army) and what do we have...? Well... we have a tank. Hey! Comrade, what's up? Watch where you move, OK? Serbs have spies everywhere. And probably contacts inside the city. OK, I know, paranoia. In any case, they are aware of everything we do They are probably arriving from this side. We will scout it out a bit. Just don't get carried away. Djero. - Eh? Here they come. Where? Oh, I see them. Mali, call it in. Enemy infantry on Calvary. About 30. - More than 30. - Less than 30... Here it comes... Let's get out of here. I think we pissed off the "neighbors". Fuck you, you almost got a memorial! You weren't notified of our return? What do you think? - Great. Waiting for the rest. - Tell them to watch out for them. If I can sneak in, so can they. We're still new... Land mine... One of yours...? - I need two... - I'll go... We can't cover you there. - We can with the car. - What, it's easier than by foot. And if you get stuck, we're fucked. - We won't, I'm sure. - I'll go with you. Let's see the tank. Toss me the tent! Watch out for ours! - Here they are, stop! - You stay with me! Drive! GO! You cover the front, I'll cover the rear! Watch out, RPG! Push it! See how it goes? A bit more and we're out! Let's go! Slowly. You and your smart ass. It works clockwork! Come on, don't fuck with me. Troublemakers... They attacked us with a tank! What tank?!? They are saying they we're attacked by an Ustashe (Croatian) tank. Now they'll stop showing off. - And become more nervous. - The more they speak about tanks, the more they get from JNA. Did you see him? Did he gaze at you? And...? Don't know... That's normal. Now you know for next time. Only then you know. No movement. Not even a dog. Nothing, eh? I expected at least a sentry. Forward? Some other time. Maybe they moved? And maybe they're acting crazy. Fuck me. Just an old hag. Old hen, greasy soup... OK, don't see any. We'll see... Let's go back. Next time on patrol, we'll enter the village. You sure it's empty? From the outside... I don't know. Maybe better not. If they really left, maybe they'll attack elsewhere. What do you think? Are we going inside? What do I know? - We need to show our teeth. - Well, we need something to show... Not all of us have rifles. Let alone, RPG's and fuck else. If they had tanks up there, we wouldn't be strolling like that. We can't just sit there and wait for them, fuck. What? You got out. I heard you saved the guy. Fuck it, we won't hold out like that for too long. If shit comes down, they'll be reinforced for sure. We should scout it. And we'll take the Bus. "The Tank". You're liking it now? It's most welcome. So the machine is bulletproof? Djuro Djakovic doesn't make them... - And you thought it would fall apart. - 28 bullets, none of them passed. Exactly 28, eh?! Chill out, man. I just want to know if it can stand against something bigger? You just keep on shiting. Watch out for them, so they don't get cocky. I don't know. They just need to know to hold it when necessary. You came up with that? Fuck you. No, really. That's very deep. Sometimes you really surprise me. Fuck off. As you wish. Just be careful. If they know you're coming, shit is guaranteed. And they will know. Guaranteed. We'll just scout it and head back. We'll be careful. I wanted to give you a radio but I gave one to Pero. And we're needed in Daruvar. There's a push there. Nevermind. We'll manage. Don't get cocky. Shall we? What's this? A fieldtrip? We can't all fit inside. We can, I'm sure. He's sure like for the 28 bullets. Mali, don't fuck around. I know you all want to get into action but don't force it. We already talked. We're going. That's it. Are you? - Fuck it. - Let's go, people. Well, get in! We should open up these. Last time, two got away. Are you crazy? Where's your rifle? Franjo has it. He's on guard, you know. So you think he needs it more than you? We made a deal because he went with you last time. That was the deal... Like they're going on holiday. Come on, with God's help. Mali, close it! Go or no go? Since we're here... - Let's... - This is it. I'm going back. Fuck all this. - What? - It's too suspicious. We should head back. Too late now. Go. Fuck... - What? - No movement. Not even the curtains. Maybe they left. - Maybe fuck no. - A monster like this and nobody to see it. Should we stop? - A bit more. - Somebody is there! - Where?! - Between those two houses, I'm sure! Where?! I don't see them! Don't slow down! Fucking Serbian bastard... Push it, let's go back! - Nowhere to go! - Everbody in the house! You check it. On my mark, in pairs! Mali, you're with me! Open it! Fuckin bastards! Let's go! Come on! Other side! Miro! House is clean! Come on! Let's go! Mali, go around! Mali, get the closet! Save your ammo. Djuro, what the fuck? - Well, he was peeking... - Shoot only if you must. You don't even see him! Why the fuck are you shooting?! How many? - See for yourself. - I see them one by one... More than 30, surely. More than enough, what are they waiting for?! They are probably organizing. Why the fuck did we enter this house?! No retreat on this side... Don't shoot if you don't see it, OK? Mali... No surrender. There's a house near, but I think they're already there. What's going on back there? - A lot of shit. - We need to wait for nightfall. We'll see. Maybe ours notice, and send someone. Where did you get the rifle? - From Ivo... - Report? - Nothing, peaceful. - "A" company is not back from patrol. Fuckin hell, they entered the village? Yes, no contact. You know what it means. I told them not to do anything. Get your men, grab the radio. Check it out. How far? - Enough to get them out. - Where did these assholes come from? Nobody was here yesterday. Fuck that. Where are they going? Tomo, stand here. Peek out just a bit, you stinking bastard. Tomo! Peek out a bit. What? - Just a bit, please. - Are you insane? - Just do it. - Crazy bastard... Give me your helmet. Fucking bastard! There you are, fucking bastard. Fucking around, eh? - Well, they're shy a bit. - Yeah, you'll see them when they take out the mortars. Take this and watch the sides. They are grouping, motherfuckers. Right side, right side! A few of them on the right! Behind the barn. Wait. NOW! Fucking hell! Watch out! Motherfucker... Watch the window! - Motherfuckers! - What's that burning? - I think it's petrol. - Looks like they're putting up a fight. It looks like a parade. They mobilized everyone. Let's go see. Listen. They're coming for us. If we're going out, now is the time. Are those ours? - Seems so. - What's the situation? A group went out. I think it's clear now. Are you sure? I am. Clear. I'm going first. No nonsense. If you see them, head back. Oh, fuck. - This won't go. - Are they coming? We'll probably need to breaktrough. Fuck it. We don't stand a chance. We can't get any further! They brought the fucking regulars. What are you talking about? The whole lot! We need reinforcements! Marko, is there any chance you could return and assist us? Negative, we're fucked here as well. Wait, we'll take two platoons and meet you there. ETA? We'll be there by 4. Just hurry up. Can we send two platoons for an intervention? We can. They scattered. Who? A bunch of regulars. Piled up in to trucks and APC's and drove away. What the fuck are they waiting for? Ours? Or theirs...? Both... What's that? From my grandfather. Grandpa, eh? I tought you said two platoons? I sent the second one around their flank. We agreed to move at 4. You? This is all. And one wounded. Put him in. We'll move him. They've been planing this for some time. I told them we had a mole in the city. They probably saw them on the barricades. Can you get more men? - I doubt it. - There's shit going around everywhere. What of the regulars? - Don't even ask. - Commander called them, they're playing dumb. They are getting cocky. Fuck 'em... Our guys are nearby, and they know we're low on ammo. Let them come close. And then give them hell. Easy now... Let them come... Hold your positions! Everyone allright?! Vinko?! - I'm OK! - Hold your fire! All down! HOLD! Watch out! Save your ammo! NOW! Empty! Give me a mag! RPG! All right, boys! They're falling back! Enough already! Enough, Tomo! They're gone. We'll all get fucked like this! Report! No movement on this side. Machine guns everywhere. Only if we go around and wait for nightfall. OK, sit tight! It will be easier when it's dark. It will be easier for the Chetniks as well. Our boys won't last that long. Watch my station, I'll be right back. They stopped firing. Something's not right. Why? - Maybe it's our relief. - They brought Chetniks from five villages, and the regulars. They're not leaving us that easily. If they stall them, we can move the wounded. If not... You're still happy you came? Cunt... What? - Something's happening. - I can't see shit. Are you sure? Yep... Tell the men. Give me you grandfathers gun. You need it? - Yes, I do. - Tomo, shit inbound. Get ready. Wait, wait! - I'm waiting... - Try to hold it. Come on. Get ready. Hurry up. Go to the back. It'll start soon. LIGHT 'EM UP! What's going on here? Go to your post! Where are you hit? - It's nothing. - What are you doing? - Shut up and get me ammo. - Was I not clear...? Where can I find you ammo for your fucking sniper? Crni! - Yes? - How much ammo you got? - I got shit! - That's the last. Now throw bricks at them. I just hope I don't take a bullet from friendlies. "A" company! "A" company, respond! - Who's there? - Miro, hey! Don't shoot! It's me, Marko! It's not us! They know we're here. We need a way out. Check it out. - Allright. - What the fuck are you waiting for?! Get your asses over here! We have wounded! You come to us! Don't bullshit me! Get over here! I can't leave the men? What now? Blue 1, Blue 1! Respond! No way we can get there. - I told them. Come to us. - What the are you waiting for? Leave the wounded and go. There's no cavalry or tanks coming. Why would you die with us? We came together, we leave together. The fuck we will. Why are you fucking with me? - Then what should we do? - Go home? And when they ask where's the rest? Could you do that? Luckily, I'll never find that out. Miro, can you hear me?! - Yes! - Listen! Reinforcements are coming! They carry the big guns! - When? - Morning, not likely until noon. We don't have anybody else. What do you want me to do? Nothing... Try to get to us while there's a chance. We decided... We're not moving. Nobody get's left behind. Let's go. - Wait! - We got here, we're moving on. Blue 2, Blue 2! Report! They're moving towards you. Try and stall them! Blue 2, report! It's a special unit. There's too many for us. We need to retreat. - We can't. - Then what the fuck we do? - How much ammo you got? - What...? - How much? - Three clips... - Give... - Hold as long as you can. No reason for all of us to die. Take the helmet also. I'll be right back. One going to you! Cover fire! Hold this. Where's Kruno? - Inside. - I'm sorry... What's happening out there? They're closing in. Heavy weaponry. Coming from the eastern sector. How did they know? - Moles from the city. - We taped their radio. They think it's an offensive by us. If they weren't attacking you, the eastern sector would fall. Well, that's something. How much ammo did you bring? What we could spare. Crni! - What? Someone's there. Where? By the window. Listen, they called everyone. But the Serbs brought everything. There's no way to pull you out. We've been through that already. You came here for nothing. Thanks for the ammo. Who's there?! - It's Bozho. - Hold! Come here! Make room! What? You shit your pants? What the fuck are you doing here? Listen, they know we moved in on them. Now they'll give you some time to breathe. They'll move on you at dawn. Their SWAT gave them some order. Where's the rest? - Inside. - Pero... You head back. Tell them to retreat. And you? - None of your concern. - Is somebody coming or not? We can't hold out much longer. Not until morning. Can you hold until then? We don't stand a fucking chance. Then pull back. That's an order. FUCK! Pero's coming back. We're moving out! They got out. And now we wait. They're out. "A" company, listen. We need to hold out until tomorrow. There's too few of us, so be ready to reposition. They'll come at least once before morning. Give them hell. He doesn't need that. It's empty... No ammo for me...? Shit, man... Nobody likes marksmen... OK... I like you... Crazy bastard. - Not too long now. - They're on all sides! I only have three more bullets! Just shoot the fucking bastards!
