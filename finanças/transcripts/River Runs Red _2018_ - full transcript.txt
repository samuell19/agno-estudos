Subtitles by explosiveskull Daddy, who was Muhammad Ali? Oh, he was the greatest. The greatest? Yes sir. He was daddy's first hero. I thought he was a boxer. Well he was, he was a boxer, but, he was so much more. See, he stood by everything he believed when it cost him everything he worked for. Well let's say it, Daddy, say it! all right, you ready? Float like a butterfly, Sting like a bee. Rumble, young man, rumble! I got something for you. Ooh. Somewhere in here. Here it is. Okay. Just for me? Mhmm. Uh oh. Hey. You drew this? Mhmm. Not bad, kid. Who's that? That's me. Okay, is that mommy? Mhmm. And who's this? You. All right, good stuff. Oh hey, daddy. Hmm? Are black people better than white people? Yes. Um, yes and no. See there are good white people and good black people. There are bad white people and bad black people. It's the same for both. Do you get it? Mhmm. How do you know? How do I know? Uh well, you don't really. You don't know until it's too late. Oh, here comes mommy. Listen, let's not worry her about what happened today, okay? Okay. It can be our secret. Hey mommy. Hey! Mr. Coleman? Mr. Coleman? Would you summarize U.S. versus Johnson please? I'm sorry Miss Maxwell. I had to watch my son last night so I didn't make it that far. That's funny. Because that was the first case on the assignment. You know what, since you seem to have forgotten that this is law school and not grade school where your parents check their homework, come on up. Come on up. Come on. I want you to read the case out loud to all of your classmates. Just like you did in grammar school. Um, Charles? Charles? Charles, it's ten till! Yeah. Are you okay? Quiet this morning. Oh, I, just got a lot on my mind. It doesn't matter how many blessings I count. You're at the top of every list. I know. 'Cause I'd hurt you if I want! Is that CJ? Does he still have a key? Hey, he's still our son. Hi baby. Hey y'all. Hey y'all? That's all we get, huh? Hey mom, hey pops. Love you, morning. Thank you so much for letting me raid your fridge even though I don't live with y'all no more. Hey dad. Hey. I'm running late, I gotta go. All right, see you mom. Cool beans. That's not cool, mom. See you later. Love you. Be careful. Bye guys. Big day today, huh? Yeah man. About time too. Yeah. I'm proud of you. Uh oh. What? That look. What look, what are you talking about? Why you tripping? Dad, you know what look you give me. I'm not giving you a look. So you're telling me that there's nothing on your mind right now? There's nothing on my mind. What's on your mind? Why you picking on me this morning? I don't got any, - I mean, okay. - You got a hot seat. Come on dad, I know you. I know you, I know the look. Oh you think you know me? I know when you make that face, what it means. Okay. You know me. What are you, 20, 21, 22? You know I'm 23. - You're 23 okay. - You know this. All right, you think you're ready yet? Huh? Dad, don't do this. Come on put that knife down. Let's see what you got. - You feeling lucky today? - I don't need luck for this. Oh, you don't need luck. Come on, lock them hands and do the countdown. All right. Don't be upset with me when I hurt your feelings. I was gonna say the same thing. Right, all right. I'm gonna count it down, ready? Three, two, one! Come on, man. Get off me. I told you I ain't no little boy no more. You're getting too old for this. I wasn't even warm yet. You're getting too old to play these games with me. Oh, keep talking. Hey pops. What's up? Since to the victor go the spoils, why don't you let me take the Beamer out just one time? Say what? Come on man, just this one time. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hey. So, I dropped off Brie for her first day of her last year at high school today. Oh wow. How's she doing? She's better. Her counselor told us that the stealing stems from emotional issues. She was frustrated. I was like yeah, we fucking know that. Because of the divorce and, Baby, yeah. Kids are unpredictable. No matter how much we do for them. What's going on, man? Um. CJ's first day at the academy. He's a good kid, he's gonna do fine. Yeah, yeah. He is. Um, I know this goes without saying.

Thank you. How's your dad? Same. Yeah? You see him? Yeah. Always. Thank you counsel. Sir, do you have anything to add? Your honor, some people say they're sorry when they get caught up. Some don't even say sorry when they do get caught up. So saying sorry really don't mean much. You know what I'm saying? But what I can say is you don't ever have to worry about me stepping foot in this place again. It's on my word. I just, I just need that chance. I appreciate your candor, Mr. Jackson and I've seen your improvement. Congratulations. That being said, I can't give you probation. I just can't. Especially your sentence being 10 years. But that does not mean that you are without redemption. So the court orders you to house arrest for 12 months, followed by two years probation defense.

Eve, I've worked too hard. I'm the only black judge this town has ever seen. If I quit, they win. Do you think I don't care? Do you think I don't care? I get sick to my stomach. Like literally sick. Every time I turn on the TV and see another black boy killed. It makes me, but then I remember. I came from the streets, and I can't, I'm a judge now. I have to be different. I have to do my job better. I have to make them see me. I can't quit, I have to be different. CJ was different. Yo, Javier, Javier! They shot Diego! What the fuck, man? What happened? He crossed over to Parramore, man. To see some broad. I told this dude, man. Diego, you know better than that. The truce stops at Parramore. Javier, it hurts man, it hurts. Come on man, he's leaking. Get him to a hospital. Mmm-mm, Mmm-mm! Warrants man, I can't do it, I got warrants. Okay homie, listen. You wanna go to jail or you wanna die? 'Cause I can't fix that. Okay, all right. I'll get you a lawyer now. Cop your bail and everything, okay? Just, J, just don't die on me. Get him to a hospital. Don't die. Hi yes, I'm Karen White standing outside city hall where you all recall there was a terrible tragic shooting by State Police last week. And what happens now is that an anonymous source has indicated that this city will meet with Judge Coleman today regarding the death of his son Charles Coleman Junior. The city has been divided by the shooting. Black lives matter has shown up, it's been... Why did you do that? CJ's not a cause. He's our son. Rory Carter, Von Clements. I remember them. They say CJ had a gun. Yeah. That's what they say. Do you believe them? I don't. You say that like it's a question. Just telling you what I know. Why are they even meeting if they think CJ did something wrong? Kids are unpredictable. No matter who their parents are. But they're our kids. We gotta believe them, right? I know he didn't have a gun. You okay, kid? Heard you got a meeting with Brock today. Good. You got it. I put enough time into my job that I thought it was easier that I just pick up my pension instead of going through another investigation. Hey Rory, listen, I, It's okay. You don't have to thank me. No, that wasn't what I was gonna say. Are you gonna say something that's gonna cost me my pension? Yeah, after I saved your ass? Come on. Yes, I saved your ass. For some punk ass kid. Is that what you're gonna say to me? No, man. You killed the kid. You killed the kid and you planted a fucking gun on him, Rory. Oh fuck. It's done. It's not done! It's done. And there's nothing you could say, today, tomorrow, that'll bring that kid back. I know. I fucking know. He should have known better. He stuck his hand inside a bag, Von. How are you supposed to know what he's gonna pull out? Now just think of this. If he did have a gun, if you hesitated to shoot, then what? He didn't have a gun, Rory. The official report says he had a gun. He just reached for his fucking wallet. I've covered you in the street and I'm asking you now. Cover me. What's this, a showdown? 200 calendars ago, the fastest draw would walk away. Today, we both do. My son doesn't get to walk away. Judge. I uh, You can't even bring yourself to apologize? I don't apologize for doing my job. You don't realize, that kid you killed, he has a father. A father with resources. A father who's gonna use every single resource he has to make sure you never forget the day you pulled that trigger. That box, that's only the beginning. Like I said, I don't apologize for doing my job. Shh. And you feared for your life? That's when you began to fire? Is there anything else you would like to add? Son, anything else you'd like to add? No. No. Mayor Johnson should be here shortly. Thank you. Good morning judge. I apologize for the tardiness. I found myself on the wrong end of a fender bender this morning. And then the guy that hit me had the audacity to try and flee the scene. Now you know my motto. Action don't happen until I act on. So I chased him down, blocked him in, called our finest and booked his butt. Right. Good to see you too. You know everybody here. DOJ Hinkle. Chief Mallard, Deputies. Gentlemen, our Mayor, I thought we were having this meeting in private. Yes, of course. But being as this is a public entity, I'm bound by my open meeting laws to be open. Very well. Sir, I know you finished the investigation. I'd like to know what you plan to do to the gentlemen that murdered my son. And I'm assuming you've landed on a punishment. Uh, judge. I'll speak plainly. As an institution, we have to trust our officers unless we find evidence to the contrary. You've seen the defense lawyers attack them in court. If we lose that deference, then every slick lawyer in the country will be walking shysters down the street. Based on everything our investigators found, the officers involved in CJ's incident would not be disciplined or charged in any way. The Fed reviewed our findings and signed off. The Federal government agrees? Unfortunately, yes. Chief Mallard, the Department has signed off on this? Judge, I know this must be hard for you to understand right now. But whenever there's a doubt of what happened on the field, we have to rely on the testimony of our officers. As a former officer and as a judge, you must understand this. If you're on the wrong side of this, where are people like me? Or better yet, people who know a lot less than me to turn when the gatekeeper keeps the gate closed? Charles? I hold you in the highest esteem, highest respect. I mean, you've been on the bench for 10 years. Raised by a single mom in one of the most dangerous cities in the country. And in spite of all that, you did things people would deem impossible. We recognize that. So I went to bat for you. I was able to convince our City Council to do what we felt was in everybody's best interest to make a gesture of good will to you. Honey, what we have here is a tragedy. There is no course that will make things right. But in my power, I can offer you that. Say yes, Charles. Charles? Mayor. Charles. Well, you know what we have to do. Okay? Stevens. It didn't go well. What? You were right. They said CJ pulled. They killed my son, left him in a river of his own blood for no reason. And Eve, she's not the same. And she's not gonna be until I get some answers. - Bring a civil. - No, I can't do that. If I do that they'll take me off cases. I can do more good on the bench. But Eve, man. I mean you were IA, you know. You have access to all the internal files. Look, you had my back back in the day. I won't forget it. Let me see what I can do. Okay. Stevens. Detective, you can't go up there. Prick. That's not good. Hey. Check your email. Wasn't from me. Good evening. My name is Judge Coleman. I'm looking for Javier. Javier is not at home. He's not in trouble, is he? No, no, not at all. This actually is an informal visit. I just wanted to, he and I have, I just wanted some advice from him. You're a judge, and you need his advice? Hey. No you don't need to say nothing to anybody. Hey, Javier is at work. It's the auto shop down the block. Take a left, two lights, a right, Ralphie's. Thank you. Hey, um. I'm sorry for your loss. About what happened to Ralphie. Hey, fellas, is there a prob... Oh! Why you coming around and asking questions about Ralphie? Wait, wait, hold up, hold up. Hold up, who are you? Who is this guy? Hey, what do you want? What is wrong with you, are you crazy? You need to roll, man. You need to get out of here. Hold up, I'm looking for Javier Garcia. You went to my house asking my wife first about my son? Is it you, are you Javier? Listen, I'm a judge, all right? I'm Judge Coleman. I didn't ask, I didn't ask your name. Look, this is my son, okay? I just need a moment of your time. I need your help, I need to ask you a few things. Please. What happened to the photo? How did you find your way to this side of town? My son got shot by the same officers who shot yours. I don't really discuss that. The report says that your son ran and he pulled a gun, and it said you filed a report. I got your address that way. Not me, my old lady. I know better than that. Can you hand me that hammer right there, please? It's the hammer you're next to. You know better than that? Better than what? Okay check it. When I was coming up we lived by a code. You take mine, I take yours. You never snitch on your homies. Police play by the same rules. You shoot a cop, you're lucky to make it out alive. So you say you're a judge, right? Yes sir. How many times you see a regular kid with a complaint against a cop? How many times a cop snitch on another cop and still around to tell? That's my point. I don't need to go to law school for that. My bad about your window. Be ready in a few minutes. But you know what, I got no more words for you, man. You know, CJ's mom got pregnant when we were 17. Everybody thought we'd end up on welfare. But not me. Her father thought that I'd either end up in jail or in hell, and he hoped that I wouldn't drag her with me. And now I'm a judge. What'd he say to that? I don't know, I don't care. Look, I never had to beg anybody for anything in my life. Now I've already asked you for help once. That's all I'm gonna do. So you're a judge, you come down here and want me to help you? Help you to do what? Sue the city. Think about it? I don't need to man, I'm good. All right. Thanks. Yes? CDI, Officer Petty is on the line. He wants to know if the information released has been confirmed. Heavy is the heart of the hero that protects the city. Tell him yes. Yes sir. I'm gonna head home now, it's almost day. All right, Anne, have a good night. Stop, stop. What? What? Come on, talk to me. I can't. Come on. You don't sleep anymore. You're drinking so much. You don't spend any time with your son. It was my gun, Marilyn. My bullets. That kid didn't even have, What? He didn't have what? Oh my. Rory did it for us. Oh my god. Did you tell anyone? Nobody. Oh my god. My god, you killed that kid. You need to tell someone. No. Yes, no, what do you mean no? No, you are not living in my house with my son with that. That's, no. This is my house. No, no. My husband was not a coward. Was not afraid to do the right thing. You are, you are not my husband. I am doing the right thing. Rory was protecting us. It's us and them, Mary. It's always been us and them. It's not. It's right and wrong. And not being a coward to do what's right. I wasn't, I, I was trying... Don't, don't. Just don't touch me. Yes, Marcy. My name is Judge Charles Coleman. I was wondering if we could speak about your son Jaylen. So thank you for coming to see me. I wanted to talk about your son Jaylen. You know, Mr. Coleman, I came to peace with this mess years ago. And nothing now is gonna bring Jaylen back. Nothing. So you're just gonna let them get away with it? They won't. Whatever hurt you have in your heart, this gives comfort. It's helped me to forgive those men. And it's in God's hands now. Marcy. We can get justice. Real solid justice. We can make them pay for what they did. Now. Justice is nothing more than a fancy way of saying you get what you deserve. I disagree. Justice restores balance. Okay, it's legal. Revenge does not, revenge is illegal. You mean an eye for an eye? What makes it okay to take one man's eye and yet the very same act of taking another man's eye illegal? We don't take an eye for an eye anymore. We don't live in biblical times. No judge, you take years for stealing a two dollar loaf of bread or prisons forever for one felony conviction. I actually think the eye for an eye is more equitable. Okay, well, uh, thank you for making the trip. I'll let you know when the DA begins prosecution. And uh, you can decide then if you want to pursue it. Judge, if you fixate on getting justice, you'll forget how to live. And living is the best way we can honor our boys. Could I ask you, never mind. No, what were you going to say? Why do you live where you live, in that neighborhood? What did you expect? Gold teeth and improper verb conjugation? I'm sorry. I made one of those mistakes we discussed. 17, riding in a stolen car. We didn't have money for a real lawyer. So I took a plea. And you know what he forgot to tell me? That I'd be a felon. Not allowed to vote. Not allowed financial aid for school. So I graduated valedictorian, couldn't go to college, couldn't get a job. So here I am, a woman, a felon. That's my future for one felony. So is that justice? Where are you going? Oh, uh, nowhere. To Ralphie's. Ralphie's closed. Not tonight it's not closed. Are you sure? You know, how can you stand to look at me every day? The cops killed our son and I didn't do anything. I mean we just, went on with our lives like it never happened. I miss him. God knows I miss him. But Ralph made a choice. He chose a life that we were trying to protect him from. You say that, but babe, there's a ghost that's always here, always around. No matter how much we smile or how much we live, how much we go on, there's something that floats around and finds its way between us. You know, you pretend that you don't feel it but I know that you do. The only thing I wanna feel, that I wanna see is you coming back to me every night. I'll see you tonight. Evie! Eve? Oh, there you are. I got this. What's all this? Where's your phone? Charging. Charging, good, well leave it there because I am treating my wife tonight to a Chinese gourmet dinner. From Hai Cheng's?

Have you seen the news? They said that CJ had a gun. They're saying he was a street kid. Please call me. Hey. They're calling CJ a thug. Telling everyone that our son was a criminal! And he deserved to be killed! I know, I know. I'm handling it. You left me. Like you don't care, alone. It's been over six months, Charles. You've done nothing! I'm trying, I have tried. Since when do you try? You always do. You wanted to get a high school diploma despite me being pregnant and you did. You wanted to finish college, you did. You wanted to be a lawyer, you did. A judge, you did. A great father you were. So forgive me Charles. If you really wanted to be a man and gain justice for CJ, you would. You wouldn't try! Eve, it's not that simple. Our son, your system, Mr. Charles Coleman Senior, our protector. Thank you so much for gaining justice for my son. You are slave. You are not the man I married. I don't know what you need me to do. Mr. Mayor. Do you have a minute? Hey judge. Big city council meeting tonight. Have to improve the city revitalization project. Right, I understand. This'll just take five minutes. I'm sure you could use a break. All right. We'll pick up in 15. - Will you get me a cup of joe? - Mhmm. Honey. Two cream. You see the news this morning? Unfortunately, I did. And I promise you, we're hunting down the leaker like the dog they are. Okay. How about this, you seen this? Yeah. I curse the day the gun was made. But we find ourselves in need these days. - How about that? - Another angle of the gun. What's the point? These are two completely different crime scenes two years apart. The same gun. Okay, Ralphie Garcia, Charles Coleman II. How did you find this? Rory Carter was at both scenes. The same style of gun. Where did you get these? These are two black guns with the serial number scratched off. There are thousands of those in this city alone. What are the results of the fingerprint test? What? Did you end up checking the gun for CJ's prints? Charles, just leave this alone. This is bigger than me. It's not bigger than you! Your cops shot my son. How is that bigger than you? That's not what I'm saying. What am I supposed to tell my wife? I made her a promise that I would take care of her and my son. My son is gone. She's all I have left. What am I supposed to tell her? Answer me! Wake up, man! This is the best we got. The city tried. We offered you money, something as a token. You said no! Token sounds right about now. All right. Get me the number to judicial ethics. Yes sir. Where are people like me, better yet, people who know a lot less than me to turn? They're our kids. We gotta believe them, right? We offered you money, something as a token, you said no! Lost again? We gotta stop this, then. Stop what? Them! No more. No more, it's done. What are you talking about? No, look, this is real. This isn't some fake made up gang beef over who owns the block! This is my life! Listen man, you don't know nothing about what goes on out here. Why don't you go back to where you live, Fancyland, wherever that is. You think I've always been a judge? 'Cause you don't know me. You have no idea what I've had to do to get here. So don't play me like that. Go home. No! You can't even look at a photo of your son. Then you're gonna name a building after him hoping that it makes you feel better. Well how's that working out for you? You feel better? Listen, judge or not, you're pushing it. I'm pushing it? - Yeah you're pushing it. - What am I pushing? You're pushing it! I'm not pushing you! You let them. You let those people kill your son and didn't do a thing about it. If that doesn't push you, I don't know what will. As a courtesy, I'm gonna let you leave. Don't ever come back here. Go home. Did you? Did you even see the crime scene footage? What? This is what happens when you get a gangster who's wearing that silver on his chest. The thing is, your son didn't have a gun. The gun that they said they saw at your son's crime scene is the same gun they said was at my son's crime scene. I just saw my son die. I'm so sorry. I just saw my son die. Why would you show me that? I'm sorry, I, I, Why would you show that to me? - Why do you wanna shoot me? - Why would you show me that? You're a judge, man, you let that happen. I'm not a judge anymore. Right now I'm just a father. I'm a father who let his son down too. Why shouldn't I shoot you right now? Why shouldn't I drop you? You could. Or you could ride with me. Ride? You're a gangster? For my son, I can be. I have to make this right. I can't be in this hell anymore. How do we make this right, law school? I thought about this. I've tried their way. I gave the system a chance to respond and they didn't. So we have a choice just to let things stand or do something to make them take notice. This one killed my boy. I've done worse for less, I'm down. Who's playing? We confront them, his men, force them to face us. And I know where they are. I've watched them, study them. The older visits an old man and takes him cigars, the expensive kind. And goes home, drinks, alone. The young one puts his kid to bed and watches TV all night. We go in, redeem our sons. The response time in that neighborhood is two minutes in and out. While they're distracted, we'll catch the other one at home. So to answer your question, how do we make this right, we have to do something revolutionary. ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ You purchasing a ♪ bundle now we count rex ♪ ♪ You for everybody that hang ♪ ♪ What you think bout that ♪ ♪ Young nigger I would say ♪ ♪ Young nigger I would say ♪ ♪ Young nigger I would say ♪ ♪ Young nigger I would say ♪ ♪ Spin it spin it on ♪ the low if you want it ♪ ♪ Get it out of mother ♪ ♪ Get it out the conner ♪ ♪ Spin it spin it if you really want it ♪ ♪ You gotta get up ♪ ♪ You gotta get up on it ♪ ♪ Young nigger I would say ♪ ♪ Young nigger I would say ♪ ♪ Young nigger I would say ♪ ♪ Young nigger I would say ♪ We won't speak of this to anybody.

So who's our guest of honor? You killed my boy! So how about I kill you too? Hey. Sounds like Rory's. Judge Coleman. Didn't expect to see you here like this. I'd say your out of your element. You should have expected to see me the day you killed my boy. See now you've put us on a path where only one of us will walk away tonight and tell what happened. I'm not telling anybody. And you're taking this to your grave. Oh, fuck. My daddy didn't teach me much in life. But he did teach me two things. How to enjoy a Cuban cigar. I'm not taking about that fake shit. Leaves grown from Cuban seeds in Central American soil. If it ain't Cuban soil, it ain't Cuban, he used to say. See it's the soil that breathes it life. And two, always pick a side. When you do, you fight like hell for it. Which side am I on? When you're on the bench, you're on mine. I would have died for you. But for the record, if I knew it was your boy, it would have went down differently. Yeah, but it didn't. No, it didn't. Guess we better get this over with. Now look at me. Look at me. Look at me! I told you you're out your depth. Talk about a justified killing. Not only am I gonna get my pension but I'm gonna get myself a medal of valor. God you guys went from sugar to shit. Go ahead and kill me, man. Fuck, I'm already dead, fuck. The day you killed my son, you killed me. Okay. You all right? What happened to your mask? I wanted him to know it was me. How do you feel? I don't know, I, I stopped shaking. You think our boys will be proud? I don't know. But they would know that we love them. ♪ Come down bad man, there's no need ♪ ♪ To die tonight ♪ ♪ Water tonight ♪ ♪ Come down brown and there's ♪ no need to cry tonight ♪ Find out who called 911.
