How long do we have to do this? Watch out for the security guard. Go out the back door. Welcome. - Is Dr. Hyeon here? - He's in surgery. Oh, okay. Where's my father? - The director is in his office. - Okay. - Are you hurt? - Oh, it's nothing. - Come here, I'll take care of it. - Thanks, but I want to see the director first... Come over here. It must be hard, hurting yourself. Well look at you... The patient needs to see the doctor in charge. You little... You know 1 used to be a surgeon, too. Well I don't like former-surgeon director 0's hands. They are too cold. You cheeky girl! So, did you look into it? What? You know. Why is he still single? I don't think there's any special reason. Well do your duty as a father and look into it. Aren't you going to at least put some ointment on it? There's no need to come to the hospital for this. - You hate me to come? - No! You know, it wasn't easy to hurt myself like this. Is Dr. Hyeon here? Uh'.! Dr. Hyeon. Please take a look at my finger. It hurts when someone else treats me. It has to be you, Dr. Hyeon. Will you treat me, please? - Why does she act like that? - Trying to snare him, isn't she. She must be in his room now. Probably begging him to take her away. Shall we take a peek? I'll take you to dinner for the medical bill. You should pay the bill to your father. No! I want to pay it to you. - It would be against the rules. - Well, no one will hear it from me. The condition of the patient who just had surgery... Wait a moment. This way. What's going on? What is it? I'm sorry. I asked what's going on. I have something to say. If it's not urgent, we can talk about it later. Someone might see us. Does that make you nervous? This is where we first embraced. You didn't seem nervous then. I'll wait for you at the apartment. - I'll be late today. - I'll wait. - Why are you getting off here? -just to buy a pack of cigarettes. So. What did you want to tell me? Only what's to be expected. You don't need to worry. If you had come earlier, we could have talked in detail. But now it's too late, and I have to go back. I know you've been putting off getting married. Of course, this is something you need to consider carefully. But I don't have a son and that makes me anxious. Yes. Over there. It doesn't mean that I expect you to act like a son to me. But I do think of you that way. - Dr.Hyeon. - Yes. I want to depend on you, but don't mock my feelings. When you get to be my age you'll understand. Not at all. And I need someone to take over the hospital. What? And it might be a little early to discuss this, but how about taking your honeymoon in Europe? Six months or so. You can do some research while you're there. Yes. So, what do you think? - Hey! - What is it now? Big news! Come over here. It looks like Dr. Hyeon is going to become the director's son-in-law. Uh'.! That would make him the one marrying into a family. From tomorrow we should start calling him director. I'm a little jealous. This girl! That's the director's future son-in-law. Don't you dare! Well, a widower is safer than an old bachelor. With a bachelor, you never know what kind of secrets they're hiding. But most widowers are lousy too. Nothing but those with wilted leaves. What do you mean, wilted leaves? Something that you don't know what to do with! What's that? What are you doing? The patient in room 108 is scheduled for surgery this afternoon. Please finish the preparations. OK. Tell me the truth. You don't like me anymore? Or are you after the hospital? Or is it the director's daughter? Are you in love with her? Jeong-ja is just a young girl with a crush. But as for the hospital, there's no one else to take it over. It's hard for me to refuse. Jin-suk, you're my lover. I can't give you up. So he'll give you the hospital with no conditions? Whatever the conditions may be owning a hospital has always been my only wish. So your wish will come true, then, if I back off. I'm not trying to trade you for the hospital. Then you do want to have everything? Jin-suk! Do you want to spend the rest of your life married to a poor doctor? So, you're saying we conspire to get our hands on their money? Is there no way to live without someone else's wealth? Do doctors always have to have their own hospital? They don't, do they? So everything you said was just an excuse? Do you want me to tell you what you're really thinking? You do love jeong-ja. The hospital is her wedding dowry. That's what you're after? Don't make that horrible face. My heart is trembling even more than that face. I love you. I love you so much that I'm trying to understand how you can be so ungentlemanly. But you can't marry the director's daughter. Not as long as I'm alive. I don't need you to understand my behavior. I'm the one who needs it. Don't be smart with me. I don't need to do what you say. And don't you forget. I didn't rape you. Spare some change. Thank you! Thank You! Yes. Oh! Wow, really? I just got an answer from Dr. Hyeon. Yes, this is Jeong-ja. Doctor! I need to talk to you. I'm not begging for the love of a man who has forgotten me. And I'm not asking you to pay for your past amusement. But this is not a matter for me to worry about on my own. So I'm letting you know. I'm pregnant. You'll force me to abort it, won't you? Jin-suk! Don't worry. I don't want to be one of those pitiful women who gives birth to the child of a man who's forgotten her. I love you. I love you, so I'm trying to understand everything about you. Just tell me one thing. Do you really want me to have an abortion? I don't want a baby before I have a famfly. You need something to stimulate that paralyzed sense of reason. I'm going to tell everyone that I'm pregnant. - Jin-suk. - Let go of me. Jin-suk! Don't be rash. How can you tell me not to do anything? Shall I work on my voice and then sing a song at your wedding? Or shall I wait, and then visit your newly-wed home with the bastard child? Jil1~suk! Compound fracture. For a fall from that height, such a serious injury is rather exceptional. - Prepare for surgery. - Yes. Doctor! Nurse Nam was pregnant. Really? She lost the baby. It was 4 months along. Ah, is that so? Well... For the sake of her reputation, let's keep it a secret. The director would be displeased to hear of such conduct in one of his nurses. We should tell the father. Do you know who he is? I guess she'll tell us. Everything is ready. Dealing with the miscarriage is more urgent. No matter how much I think about it, I just can't guess. What? Nurse Nam's lover. Why would she have a secret lover? Wasn't Dr. Hyeon there when she fell? What does it make you think of? Didn't he say he was on his way to the director's office? Why are those stairs always causing such trouble? We need to fire that carpenter. Are his fingers numb or something? He can't even nail properly. Is Nurse Nam going to be able to walk? Well, Dr. Hyeon's skills are a little better than that carpenter's. So you can rest assured. Do you have any idea, madam? About what? The baby's father. - Go to sleep. - Yes, ma'am. Go to sleep! Doctor! - You seem to be in a bad mood - No. I understand why you're feeling down. It's because of Nurse Nam's accident, right? She was on my team so of course I'm concerned. But it's not like there's a special reason. You don't have to make excuses. It's true that Nurse Nam had a crush on you, isn't it? You misunderstand. Honestly, I was nervous, and jealous. But you are mine now. Don't act like a child. Here, take it. Leave me alone. Sleep? - She didn't take the pills. - She keeps refusing her medicine. Why? Because I'm afraid. There're at least two people who want to kill me. She's showing signs of neurosis. Move Nurse Nam to the solitary room on the 2nd floor. Yes, doctor. Nurse Nam! Madam! Get ready to move Nurse Nam to Room 205 on the 2nd floor. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. What were you thinking about? I was thinking of you, when you gave me this necklace. How are you feeling? Your hand is cold. When you pushed me off the stairs, trying to kill me. I felt your skin then. It was already cold. What are you talking about? Now you can strangle me with those cold hands. Luckily, the dreaded seed was miscarried. Jin-suk! But it won't happen like that. You won't be able to kill me. 1 won't the at your hands... You shouldn't babble on about such things. The talk that I'm going to be the director's son-in-law is just that, talk. But that doesn't mean you'd marry a cripple like me. You need to calm your nerves. I'll get you some medicine. Hello! Yes, it's me. A place for the honeymoon? Okay. NOW? Okay, I'll go this evening. You're just like a little girl. - Nurse Nam is missing. - What? I, I have to go. There's an emergency. Nurse Nam is missing? She's not in her bed. Have you seen Nurse Nam? I'm going to be a cripple, aren't I? Nonsense! You'll recover completely. Don't lie. I'm now a cripple. Don't let yourself get upset. Oh! I didn't know you were here. Take her inside. Come, let's go in. Where were you? Take this. - Don't despair. - Thanks for worrying about me. Don't be so formal. And make sure to follow the treatment. You have to take care of your own body, don't you? - Aren't those crutches a little short? - Yes. Let me adjust them for you. This is Dr. Hyeon from the surgery department. Please call Nurse Go for me. Come in. - Did you call me? - Yes. Well... Nurse Nam is in a nervous state. She's having trouble sleeping. Please give her this sedative. Yes, doctor. She'll be unconscious for the next three hours. Thank you. You should thank the head of surgery, not me. - You haven't left yet? - No, I was just reading a book. - Why don't you get some rest? - Yes, good night. OK. Check! Check! Take that! Defense! Sir! Check! - Well? Do you want some advice? - Oh no...it's okay. - You're late today. - Oh, I had some reading to do... - Ah, yes. - Go back to your game. - Well, take care. - Good bye! Let's play! - Hello. - Well, you're late. Let's go! I went to mend that ditch this morning, but I caught my foot on something. So I looked down and these crutches were lying there. Are you certain that these crutches belong to Nurse Nam? Yes. I was in her room often. And I adjusted them several times with my own hands. I'm certain. Did you notice anything strange at the security office last night? No. After you left, no one came in. I played games with the guard late into the night. Yes, we were playing janggi for makgeolli. The emergency exit was open, so she must have come down into the backyard. Could Nurse Nam have gotten down those stairs in her condition? She could have made it with someone's help. Someone helped her? Shall I call the police? Well... I'll discuss it with the director. - Could she have killed herself? - Is that what you think, Miss Kim? Well the crutches were found near the pond so it seems possible. Then shall we drain the pond? There will be an order from the director. Let's wait. Jin-suk's body will float up to the surface. It will come up soon. But two days have passed now. And there's still no sign of her. Could her clothes have got caught on something? No, that's impossible. So what could have happened? The body still hasn't surfaced. I putjin-suk into the pond. That's certain. But three days have passed. Why hasn't she come up? What if she wasn't dead? There's no way... No way... No way... It's already the fourth day andjin-suk's body still hasn't come up. What could have happened? No, without doubt it will come up. Umm... this. All right. Hey, we have work to do. Hey! - Follow me. - Yes. Hmm, for how many days has Nurse Nam been missing? Today is the sixth. We have to call the police. I'll do it. Why did this have to happen on the engagement day, of all days! - We have to strike while the iron is hot. - Choose a lucky day. That way! When choosing a wedding day the women always look for something. It's all for the best, there's no harm in it. Do young men today want to live with their in-laws? Well, it doesn't sound so great when you put it that way. Would you rather say you've adopted him, then? No! We are the ones living at our daughter's house. Either way, it's the same. But to be single at that age. Isn't it suspicious? He got old waiting for ourjeong-ja. It's not proper for an unmarried girl to talk like that. Oh, my! Acting like an adult. Girl, dream on! We're all virgins, but who knows about this girl? Oh, my! This is intolerable! Why are they so excited at someone else's engagement party? Well, it's none of your business. Head of neurosurgery. Well, you've failed! You have to do more research on the sensitivity of a bachelor towards single women. Hmm. This is not a laughing matter. Even an old bachelor like Dr. Hyeon has hit a jackpot. While a true bachelor like myself remains single. How can this be? You're carrying the joke too far. I can't imagine that someone Dr. Hyeon's age is still a virgin. It's not guaranteed, of course, medically. How many flowers were wasted, and how many tears shed for this engagement party? Are you drunk? As a surgeon, I was just trying to cut him open to get to the truth. What's his problem? You're next, mister neurologist. Hello. This is Dr. Hyeon, head of surgery. Yes? Yes. And? Okay. What's wrong? Well, hmm...Nurse Nam's body turned up in the hospital pond. What I? Well... The body? Yes. - We should hurry over. - Well... There are lots of guests, so I'll go. Please take care not to upset the guests. I'll be back soon. Are you sure it's Nam jin-suk? Yes. Can you identify her by the face? That would be difficult, but what she is wearing is certain. Even so, the face is too deformed. Can we be certain that this is Nam jin-suk? What do you think, sir? We don't really know what the staff look like. No. Did you say she went missing 6 days ago? Could she change so much? Well... Maybe it was the bugs in the water eating away at her. Bugs in the water? Well, let's move her. It is Nurse Nam's body. He's the head of the surgery department. - I'm Seo-won. - Got it. - Come in. - Yes. Did you say she was a nurse at this hospital? Yes, she was. - Does she have a family? - No, she doesn't. She came from North Korea when she was young all by herself. What do you think happened to Nurse Nam? I think it was definitely suicide. - Suicide? - Yes, it is clearly a suicide. Due to shock from the miscarriage. For the whole world to know that she was pregnant, as a single woman. She was prouder than anyone... Maybe it wasn't suicide. The truth will come out in the autopsy. A half year later Any great ideas? Compared to hospitals in Europe and America, our facilities are truly primitive. We need to purchase the newest medical equipment. But before doing that, how about renovating the hospital wings? If you have a good idea, Dr. Hyeon, please tell us. I think we should fill up the pond in the back of the hospital and build a new operating room and a ward for patients. What do you think? I think it's a good plan. I think that we can cover up the pond to make a lounge area for patients. No... The backyard is too shaded. It wouldn't be any good. Right. It's too deep, anyways. It's dangerous, and unsanitary. I've heard a lot of good ideas. What are those? What? Those crutches. You're back. - Who put those over there? - What? Throw them away! Where did you get them? Well... Those are... - Ah, a crippled peddler came by earlier. - Yes. Did the woman leave them? Can a cripple leave behind her crutches? A lot of people are faking it nowadays. Fake or real, throw them away! Hey, throw them away! Sir, she might come looking for her crutches, so shouldn't I leave them here? I said throw them away! Shall I set the table for dinner? Yes. Maybe the crutches have some significance? A peddler woman with a limp. There's no wayjin-suk is still alive. So what about the crutches? Dr. Hyeon, I'll be waiting for you in the X-Ray room at 10 tonight. j/n -su/ Jin-suk! What are you doing? What happened? You may think this is a strange question. But I was going to tidy up the clinical records. There's a story from half a year ago. - There was a nurse named Nam jin-suk, is that right? - Yes, I remember. The person who identified the body was you, the head nurse? Yes, I testified. Please explain the situation at that time. What situation? When you saw the body, how did you know it was Nam jin-suk? - Well the clothes she was wearing... - Anything else? - Not really... - How about her face? - It was too decomposed to make out. - Did you check the knee injury? - No, I didn't check that. - That's a very important point you missed, no? The body that turned up... Do you have any evidence that it was not Nurse Nam? Well, no... It's not that. What I wanted to know was if there were any traces of the surgery. Once they finish draining the pond, we'll find something. - What's that? - Not gold? - Let me see. - Stop it! - Damn. - I'll give it to the wife. - She's still not with child? - What's the hurry? Don't you want to meet your grandchild? I don't want people calling me a grandmotherjust yet. Oh, well... - Dinner's ready. - Oh, but... your husband? - He's sleeping. - Huh? Did they have an argument? Have some fruit. Honey, honey! Why, huh? Are you alright, honey? Out! Out! Get out! - What is it? - Dear. Dear, jeorlq-ja! Tell me exactly what's going on. Someone is blackmailing him. Oh, dear. Give me the details. He seems to be mistaking me for someone else. And he's clearly terrified... Dear! I'm scared. I'm scared, mom. Gwang-ho, if I misunderstood, I apologize, but... By any chance, is someone trying to blackmail you over a woman problem? No, sir. There's no such thing. The fact that you had a relationship with someone other than jeong-ja. I'll not rebuke you for that. But why won't you tell me the truth? I get the feeling that you are misleading me on something. I've had no other relationship, with any women at all. I'm just displeased that my wife doubts me. Maybe she's worried about you. You've been rather unsettled lately. Please rest. Jeong-ja! Jeong-ja! Jeong-ja! Yes. You're treating me like I'm crazy, huh! What wrong with my mental state? What did I... Why did you tell your father all that nonsense. Now he's trying to get into my head! If you go and run your mouth again...! I won't. Sir! The peddler who was in before, she's here again. What! Where's she? The crippled woman. She was just here. Why, what's wrong? It's not a big deal. Why's he acting like that? He's sick, without a doubt. I think he's having a breakdown. Then, I'll discuss it with the neurologist. No. Wouldn't it be better if you came out and explained the symptoms in detail? If I get caught by going to the hospital he'll never let it go. Then, let's do it like this. I'll find a reason to send your husband somewhere. Then I'll call you, and you come to the hospital. It's me, Dr. Hyeon. - You said Nam jin-suk, right? - Yes. You were the doctor in charge? Yes. Right knee joint. Compound fracture and evidence of surgery. The body is without doubtjin-suk. There's no reason to doubt the autopsy result. Thank you. Yes, come in. - Did you call for me? - Yes. Well... The reason I called is. Well... Today at 5 pm, there's an award ceremony for Dr. Yu Ho-jin at Korea House. Yes. You'll have to go instead of me. I drank too much yesterday. I'm still a little hungover. Alright. I'll have to go soon. - Good bye. - Yes. Oh, it's me This is our opportunity. Come now. What? With your mother? Hmm, as you wish - Oh, you're back already. - Where isjeong-ja? She just left. - Did she say where she was going? - To the hospital, I think. - The hospital? - Yes, I think she made a call to the hospital. It must have been about his problem. What were the questions about, in general? They were about hallucinations. And what else? That a dead woman came back to life. A dead woman? Don't forget that he said the story came from a friend. Who was the dead woman? A lot of people die in front of doctors. He's coming. If he finds out I'm here he won't stand for it. Je°"9-ja, dear! How dare you? Hey! -Dr. Hyeon! - Hey! - Control yourself - Let me go! - Oh, doctor! - Let me go! Jeong-ja! Jeong-ja! Then, maybe Nam jin-suk was murdered? She was murdered. Hyeon Gwang-ho tookjin-suk to the hospital pond and drowned her. - Then whose body was that? - There was another murder. So where is Nam jin-suk's body, the one Dr. Hyeon killed? We can't say for sure that Dr. Hyeon killed jin-suk, can we? Clearly, he put her into the pond and killed her. The body that floated up is notjin-suk. We haven't recovered jin-suk's body. A murder charge for Dr. Hyeon would be uncertain. SQ? After receiving a note from the hospital directing me to take over the body, I came up with a wicked plan. A plan to escape from poverty. So with your own hands, you put your daughter's body into the hospital pond? Yes. And the next day you went there to collect the body? Yes. So how much did you get? Well, I got 20,000 won from the hospital director, under the condition that I keep my mouth shut. And you would have negotiated for more by making some noise about the body being gone. - Yes. - Damn you! You should have quiet and blackmailed him. Why did you turn yourself in? It was gone. What was gone? My daughter. How could I do it? I placed her there with my own hands! Then I heard a rumor that the hospital pond was being dug up. So I hid and watched... But my daughter's body wasn't there. Well what happened? Either she came back to life alive... or turned into a ghost to come and kill me! I came here because I was afraid. She's a ghost and she's going to drag you by the neck down to hell. Hell? That's where I belong. That is...that is clearly jin-suk, whom I killed. It's a ghost! The ghost ofjin-suk! Hyeon Gwang-ho! You are under arrest for attempted murder. The man who stole the body from your hospital, has turned himself in. Let's go. This criminal said he received money from you. Come with us. Now, let's go! - You must be Nam jin-suk? - Yes. - First, you have to come to the police station. - I want to testify. I'll go, too. That's the man who killed me so cruelly. That I'm alive now is no mistake on his part. But a matter of my willpower. But Dr. Hyeon was arrested for attempted murder. The law is not on my side. It protects villains from divine punishment. So I decided to get revenge, not go to the police. I wanted to kill him, cruelly. But, 1 famed. Attempted murder.
