(ominous music) (crowd cheers) - Santo, Santo! - And so the main event has begun. Santo, the crowd idol, is fighting against Angel Blanco. And the match begins already with a lot of action. The international referee Ranquel presides the bought. And we see Angel Blanco giving a merciless beating to Santo using a legal move, and the referee can't do anything about it due to the physical strength of this man, who by the way, many experts say could be the next big thing. He came here today to defeat the idol of the crowd and become world famous. However, the dexterity of Santo manifests itself right here in the biggest arena in the capitol of the Mexican Republic. The arena is sold out to its maximum capacity. A really modern arena. (crowd cheers) (fist whacks against head) Ouch, that eye poke could seriously hurt Santo! The action-packed fight continues. A throw to the ropes and it ends with a blind shot to the chest. One, two. But Angel Blanco pushes Santo away and repels the attack, which seemed to secure Santo the first fall. Santo is repeating a series of very strong and legal blows with a forearm to the chest. Santo has done a lot of damage to Angel Blanco's face. And now let's see what's coming up next. Oh, and now he throws him into the turnbuckle! What a slam! Angel Blanco is hurt. Santo has an agility and here's one of his favorite moves! Santo going for the cover, no! He prefers to finish him off. Santo has the rare ability to know exactly when to apply his finisher move. Here it is and there it is! His famous camel clutch that has given him so many victories! (bell rings) And now Angel Blanco gives up! Santo wins the first fall! - Santo, Santo! - Santo did it! He has easily taken the first fall. Just listen to the crowd cheering. - Santo, Santo! - Of course he deserves this big ovation. And now the second fall begins. Remember, this is a best of three falls match with no time limit. (crowd cheering) (both grunting) The fall begins with a strong leg vice to the neck. Santo's again showing he knows countless holds as he pushes Angel Blanco to the turnbuckle and springs him again! Classic Santo move. Now Santo attacks the arm. Apparently the strongest part of Angel Blanco are his arms. But he takes him down, he's also a dirty fighter! He uses an illegal move. Oh, and another eye poke! That eye poke has done a lot of damage. Here's Angel Blanco, he staggered the idol of the crowd! Santo is now in danger after that blow to the jaw! He's hurt. Blanco has him, notice the damage Santo has taken to his eyes. Angel Blanco has hurt Santo's physical condition, but he's still making a desperate struggle to keep going! The crowd can't help but wonder why Santo accepted this match with a man who's much heavier than himself. Again, Angel Blanco uses a low blow! An illegal punch below the belt! Totally illegal. The referee is admonishing Angel Blanco, who now drives Santo into the corner. What's he planning to do there? Careful, Santo. Hits him with a hard knee to the solar plexus. Ooh, this is to destroy Santo's physical condition. And now he goes for a double arm bar. Santo does not give up, no, no, no, no, no. He won't give up! Santo fights desperately and doesn't give up. So now Angel Blanco's looking for another way to hurt him. He uses the cobra twist! A complicated hold. (bell rings) Santo surrenders! The match is now tied. (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) (flames roaring) - Oh, powerful Satan, who reigns in the world of darkness. Satan make your will fulfilled as written in the "Book of Kabbalah." Seven sonic eclipses have now passed, as seven moon eclipses have too, since the Wizard Cristaldi killed Count Dracula and the werewolf. Tonight the blood of another member of the Cristaldis will restore their lives. (dramatic music) (fire roaring) (gentle music) - Mom look, I have finished dressing Juanita. - That's great, honey. It's also time to go to bed. Josefina. - Yes, ma'am? - Would you please take Rosita to her bed? - That's looking really good, ma'am. - It's actually the only thing that distracts me. - Don't say that, ma'am. You're still young and beautiful. For example, my sister also says... - Mom, tell Josefina to read me a story. - All right but please get in your bed first. Give your grandpa a goodnight kiss. - Good night, Grandpa. - Good night, my princess. Why are they taking so long? - Oh, for God's sakes, Dad. Remember, we don't live in the city anymore. The highway must be full of traffic at this hour. And the match is probably ending just now. - And now begins the third fall with an impressive dominance by Angel Blanco. (elbow whacks against back) (Santo groans) The crowd is very nervous. Angel Blanco is slightly dominating Santo. Santo's tried even the impossible but he's in serious danger of losing a match for the first time in his life. He's struggling with all he's got! The referee says, "No!" And now Santo finally escapes but he must be exhausted! More than 220 pounds were on his spine. It's impossible to get up easily from that. But now we see the intelligence of Santo right now as he's taken advantage of an armbar to recover from his wounds. He's taking in good air. - Santo, Santo! - Angel Blanco uses his tremendous strength to break the armbar. And now he counterattacks with and arm and neck hold. He's trying to distract the referee's attention with that hold but his knee is on Santo's neck. Santo doesn't give up! (crowd cheering) (both grunting) Let's see what Santo does now. He's being pressed down with full force! Angel Blanco is trying to break Santo's arms but Santo escapes, putting all his strength through a scissor kick to Angel Blanco! He looks exhausted, though. Now Santo uses an illegal move! Why? He's desperate to defeat the man who has hit him with everything, knees, fists, eye pokes! And now Santo's is taking good advantage of that forbidden blow he did that has opened the door to his victory. But Santo still has to fight hard to reach it. And boy, look at the that! The idol of the crowd sure knows how to combine his techniques. It's incredible! A throw to the ropes and now waits for his victim. Santo may be looking to finish this. But now he prefers to secure the win and is using his famous camel clutch! Angel Blanco is trying to escape but Santo captures his arms into a reverse arm bar! That's it, he finally gave up. - Santo, Santo, Santo, Santo! (crowd cheering) Santo, Santo, Santo, Santo, Santo! - Get dressed and let's go. My uncle wants to talk to you. - About what? - About something important and strange. Well, he'll explain it to you. But you must hurry! - I'm aware of all your feats, Santo. However, I don't think that you have ever faced something as terrible and frightening as the horrible curse that hangs over my family and me. - What are you talking about, professor? - For starters, hear this letter out. "Professor Luis Cristaldi. "Prepare yourself to pay off the old debt. "The deadline is soon to come. "The time is near. "You and those you hold dear "will face a horrible destiny. "There is no escape. "The power of our vengeance will reach you anywhere." - Mm. It seems to be a very bad joke. - I told you, Dad. It's just a bad joke. - I wish it was just a joke like any other. However, this sounds like something I read from that book before, which was written four centuries ago. Listen carefully. "Count Dracula, King of Vampires, "tried to unify powers of darkness "through a pact with the Werewolf, "head chief of a dreadful group of beast men, "so the two species finally could dominate humanity." - But now uncle, I don't understand. What does this have to do with us? - "But there was a man who discovered their evil plan. "He was Edico Cristaldi, "a wise alchemist of Tulum, "who mortality wounded both of them "with the Boidros magic dagger. "Count Dracula in his agony "proclaimed this curse. 'Damn you and your bloodline, Cristaldi! 'I'll be back when the cabalistic term is fulfilled. 'And I will transform all your descendants 'into wondering corpses. 'Abominable living death to whom the Earth 'does not hold shelter. ' (ominous music) (sighs) - (chuckles) Come on, Dad. You're a man of science. How can you believe such ridiculous stories? - Science has limits that are far beyond mystery. There are hidden powers that have many fields and many tools against evil. Like this dagger that comes from the Boidros. A nice weapon (ominous music) that can be used to fight against hellish beings. But these others, this and this and this were made to help the cause of evil. I don't fear for myself. I already live my life. I fear for my daughter, my niece, especially for my granddaughter, who is the last of Cristaldis. Please promise me, Santo, if something happens to me, you will protect my family. - It is a promise, professor, but this treaty is tied to a deadline. Has the time been met? - I can't tell for sure. The magic chronology is so confusing. - Do you believe there is immediate danger? - As long as nothing happens to me, my family will be safe. And it's them who needs to be protected. - I understand. (door creaks) - From now on you and your people should ready and alert. - It makes me nervous not knowing what the job is about. - Even I don't know it myself. My employers arrive tonight. They come from very far away. They expect the best. - I would like to meet your employers. - (laughs) You don't know what you're saying. Those who know my employers just wish for one thing. - What thing? - To die quickly. Tonight I have something very important to do. - Need any help? - No, it's something I must do without any help. (dramatic music) (soft music) (sighing) (sighs) (gentle music) (sighs) - Hmm. (sighs) (sighs) (dramatic music) (Luis groans) (Eric grunts) (dramatic music) (fire roaring) - Do you know what's coming to you, Professor Cristaldi? - Yes, I know. But who are you? - Does it really matter? (dramatic music) (fire roaring) - You will unleash two terrible evil forces and you won't get anything from it. - I will earn a lot,... a whole lot! I want you to know that my ancestors brought from Transylvania these two coffins and hid them in this cavern. They spent their lives taking care of them. And I have the honor of opening them and sacrificing you to resurrect them. Do you have any idea how much Count Dracula will pay me for resurrecting him? - Never trust a hideous monster from Hell! - I don't want his gratitude! I want his gold. His gold. (dramatic music) (crow bar clacks) (lid squeaks) (grunts) (lid scrapes) (lid clanks) (ominous music) (grunting) (lever squeaks) (dramatic music) (Luis gasps) (dramatic music) (fire roars) (shrieking) (smoke hissing) Lord of Shadows, arise. The world of the living awaits. (knife clatters) (dramatic music) (shrieking) (wind howling) (growls) - And you are? - I'm Eric, my lord. The instrument chosen for your return. As planned, the blood of the last Cristaldi has brought you back to life. - Cristaldi? - Yes, my lord, that man I personally... - I would have loved to see his ancestor like that. That damn wizard, Cristaldi. I am very glad but not yet satisfied. How many Cristaldi are left? - Three, two women and a girl. - And where are they? - They are nearby. At the old house near the crossroads. (fire roars) - Is that my loyal Rufus? - Yes, my master. Rufus, the great Werewolf. (dramatic music) (growling) - Ah. (growling) - (growls) I'm ready, Master. - The long dream we were forced to take has come to an end. We can continue what we left unfinished. First of all, we have to start the hunt for human beings to turn them into vampires and werewolves. If we want to take over the world, we need to multiply our species. (dramatic music) (fire roars) - No! (growling) Let go of me, leave me alone! Release me! Marta, Marta! What are you going to do? (growling) Leave her alone! Marta! Don't touch her! (hisses) No! (hisses) (dramatic music) (Marta screaming) No, don't do this! No, help me! Leave her alone! (Werewolf growls) - Satan, Prince of Darkness. Tonight we offer the first victim who will become part of the new legion. This will be the road that leads our family to it's final triumph! (fire roars) (ominous music) (lightning strikes) Now you have entered our world. You are immortal. (lightning strikes) (rooster crows) Tomorrow, get in touch with Cristaldi's daughter. It is up to you to sacrifice her on the first full moon. That night, she will come to you for love. (Werewolf groans) (rooster crows) (ominous music) (Werewolf groaning) (snores) - Lots of people disappear because they want to. They leave without notice due to personal reasons even their own family ignore. - That's not my uncle's case, commander. He left without his jacket, left his pipe and his glasses. He needs them to move. He went upstairs to his room and was surely about to sleep. - My father is not the kind of man that would do the things you're saying, commander. - So what you're saying is that someone took the professor against his will? - That's what we think. - Is there any kind of evidence that supports that idea? - I think we should inform the commander about the fears your dad talked to us last night. - Those are just absurd fantasies that are not relevant, Santo. - Please let me be the one to judge if those fantasies are relevant or not to this case. I'm listening, Santo. - Commander, last night the professor told us about a certain clause made by Count Dracula and the Werewolf. (groans) - Master, Master. - What time is it? - Past noon, master. (groans) - I'm really glad that you woke me up. Our mission cannot be delayed. - I got an apartment in the city for you, Master. To make things even easier for us. - Let's go. - So perhaps the deadline was about to be met or something like that. I believe that. - It's way too fantastic of a story to be able to work with. Can you imagine what the paper's would say about the police trying to find Dracula and the Werewolf's house? You understand, right? - Yes, I do, commander. - You look quite dashing, Master. - Yes, I look good. Now my friend, it's time to design a strategy to make contact with Professor Cristaldi's daughter. - We are not kidnapping her? - No, that would be very easy. I'll make her fall in love. - Girls, because of the commanders reaction, you can realize we can't count on the police from now on. - From now on? Santo, do you think they'll try to do something against one of us? - The only thing I know is that what Professor Cristaldi feared so much is already happening. - Santo, I fear my daughter. What are we going to do? - I'm going to ask for help to a really faithful and courageous friend. He's a great ally and will be of great support. - But who is he? (crowd cheering) - Blue Demon versus Renato el Hippie in a best of three falls match. The masked Blue Demon is an agile man but he is also facing a lightning speed rival. (both grunting) We can see unorthodox moves by these ring athletes. (both grunting) Inverted neck lock! But look at that escape. Now look at that hammer and head hold! Renato el Hippie is also an accomplished athlete. Check out those powerful muscles. That headlock puts strong pressure on the neck. (crowd cheering) (both grunting) Blue Demon begins his escape and hits his rival with a backbreaker! However, Renato took the fall correctly, evading any damage during this first fall. (both grunting) (crowd cheering) That was an awesome judo throw by Blue Demon. Now he wins this exchange. A perfect flying scissor throw executed by Blue Demon. And as Renato goes for a Boston crab, he falls wrapped around his rival's legs. And again! Such great moves in this first fall. But Renato is now trapped in a hold. That's one of Blue Demon's most feared moves. The rolling cradle! Using the legs, the cradle has begun. A move we hadn't seen in a long time! (crowd cheering) (both grunting) Renato's back is against the floor, but he gives up first and that's it. Blue Demon easily takes the first fall. Another great demonstration (bell rings) from Blue Demon. (crowd cheering) Hear that ovation for Blue Demon. We are now ready to continue with the second fall of this best of three falls match. (crowd cheering) (both grunting) (hand whacks against face) Ooh, good, clean hit which is allowed but only with an open palm hand. That move's name is fake shot post and Renato executes it with ease. Now we have an inverted headlock. Blue Demon was looking for a good position to lift his opponent. (crowd cheering) He's leaning back and how could he escape that move without almost losing his arm? (both grunting) The attacks of Blue Demon are very fast. He leaves his rivals completely off guard. His legs are like tweezers. More like heavy duty pincers! Blue Demon is easily dominating Renato el Hippie. He goes, oh, a good armbar on Blue Demon's right arm. And Renato's increasing the damage by pulling the mask to the other side! Renato el Hippie is sweating heavily as Blue Demon starts saving his strength. That was a good try but it didn't work on Renato el Hippie. Smart move. And now see the masked man escape the hold using a double arm throw on his rival. Blue Demon receives a heavy tackle which has left him completely off-balance! El Hippie is taking big risks! Look at that flying headbutt! El Hippie tried to avoid it the move was very effective! Blue Demon wants to finish the match! And one, two, three! That's it! Two falls in a row! (bell rings) Blue Demon wins the match! (crowd cheering) - Demon, now you know everything. I did not think it wise to tell you this before your match. - Of course, and I'll be very glad to work with you again, Santo. - Thanks, Blue Demon. - I think just like you. That there is something supernatural behind all of this. I believe we will have to keep a close watch over the Cristaldi family to avoid another attack. - I was just going to propose that to you. - It's been a while since I used the transmitter watch you invented, Santo. Right now this watch will be very helpful. - We'll fight together again for good and justice, my friend. - Yes, partner. - Hey, come! (Laura gasps) - What are you doing? - Come on! - Help me. (screams) Let me go! - Stop moving! - Help! - Come on! (fist whacks against face) (men grunt) - Move it! (engine whirring) Come on! Let's go, let's go! - Oh, how can I ever thank you for what you've done for me, sir? - No problem, no need to thank me, miss. Do you know who those men were? - No, I have no idea. - They were going to kidnap you because you are quite the catch. That could be the reason, miss. Or is there something else? - I don't know, maybe. Thank you very much again, sir. My name is Laura Cristaldi. - I am Rufus Rex and I would like to put myself at your service. And now, miss, please let me walk you back home. Those men could probably try to return. - There's no need. - Well, miss, joining you would be my pleasure. - Thank you. (engine whirring) - It was reckless to go by yourself to the town. You should have waited for us to get here. - Fortunately there were no consequences and here I am. Safe and sound. Thanks to him. - (laughs) Him? - Yes, I mean the guy who saved me. - Did he arrive on a white horse? - Okay, that's enough of that. We are lucky nothing happened to her. - Hmm, but it will, (chuckles) it will. - Maybe, why not? - Yes, why not? Is he handsome? - Very handsome. - My master. - What have you done? - I made my first contact with Laura Cristaldi. She is sad romantic woman. She will fall in love with me, and then I will sacrifice her on the next full moon. - Our vengeance has become an unstoppable force. And now it is my turn. Tonight, I will take control over Cristaldi's girl. She's the last of the damned bloodline. (women chuckle) (dramatic music) (bat shrieks) (wings flap) (growls) (dramatic music) (shrieking) (banging) - Did you hear that? - My daughter! (dramatic music) (mystical music) - Your child is fine. - Oh, thank God! For a moment, I thought that... - No, don't worry, Laura. - It was that damn Boidros Dagger again! It's still held by the Cristaldis. - But how could it be in the girl's bedroom? - Surely that old professor foresaw what was going to happen and placed it there thinking it would protect her. As it has. I need to find a way to get that girl away from that cursed dagger. You must continue your mission. Our vengeance cannot be stopped. - Yes, Master. On the next full moon, Laura Cristaldi will die. (Laura laughs) What do you think? - It's wonderful, really. Hi. - Hi. - I'd like you to meet Mr. Rufus Rex. The man I have spoken so much about. This is my cousin Lina. - Nice to meet you. - And these are Santo and Blue Demon. The famous wrestlers. - Likewise, sir. - It's a pleasure. - Are you going out? - Yes, I'm going to the bank. - Will you excuse me? I want to show something to Mr. Rex - Excuse us, gentlemen. - Go ahead. - Is that the guy who helped Laura the other day? - Yes, and my cousin is really falling for him. - Santo, unless you think otherwise, while you go with Lina, I will stay here killing some time. - Good idea. - Hmm, excuse us. - I never thought I'd be so happy again. (romantic music) (Rufus moans) (ominous music) (grunting) - Things are going well, Eric. Laura Cristaldi is madly in love with me. (Eric chuckles) (dramatic music) (sighs) - Don't look out the window, Master. They are spying on us. Just play along with me. Yes, I know it's a lot of money but for that amount, I will tell you the whereabouts of Professor Cristaldi. And if you care about the woman, stop thinking, take action now. (grunts) (transmitter beeping) - Santo, Santo? - Come in, Blue Demon. I hear you. - He is gone. He must have gone to communicate with the other masked man. They will rendezvous and will follow me to know who I am. - You are a smart man, Eric. - I'll be there immediately. If he leaves before I get there, follow him and send me his location. We have to find out who he is. - (gasps) Where are you going? I'll go with you. - I'm going to a place where there could be danger, so you have to stay here, love. I'll get the car keys. (bright music) (engine whirring) (groans) (clanking) (cat meows) (tires screech) (suspenseful music) - Stand still! - Turn on the oven. - The what? - The oven, where we burn the garbage. - My pleasure, boss. (laughs) - Who gave you this job? - No one. - Then why? - You came in here by chance. And since you have interfered in my affairs before, it's just natural for me to kill you, isn't it? - Uh, where is the hunchback? - I don't know what you're talking about? - What did you do to Professor Cristaldi? - Professor what? - Uh, forget it. (fire roars) - Hey boss, how hot do you want it? - 270 degrees. - Okay. The oven is way hot. (all chuckle) (chuckles) - I'm curious to meet the real Santo. Boss, let me take off his mask. - What are you waiting for? Take it off. (men laugh) And the other one too. (engine whirring) (bags and boxes rumble) (men groan) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (fist whacks against face) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (bodies thudding) (all grunting) (chair bangs against head) (Lina whistles) (all grunting) (bodies thudding) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (all grunting) (bodies thudding) (bags and boxes banging) (gangster groaning) (foot thuds against body) - You see, we were saved by our guardian angel. - Our guardian angel? It was Lina. (Blue Demon chuckles) (siren wailing) (tires screech) - That pair of masked men surely have a pact with Satan. I think that instead of killing them, we should make those guys join our cause. - It'll be useless, Master. That man Santo is just a damn fool. He still believes in goodness and justice. (chuckles) And the other masked man is also an idiot. - Then we will have to kill them no matter what. Tonight we'll have a full moon and they could get in my way. And even stopping the sacrifice of Laura Cristaldi. You are very wise, Eric. I'll call her. (rotary clattering) - This is really strange. I can't believe even for a second that Rufus has something to do with... - Ma'am, Mr. Rufus is on the phone. - Oh, excuse me. Rufus is on his way. He says that last night he was visited by a very strange man, who asked him for a large amount of money to tell him where Dad is. And to prove his words, he gave him my Dad's watch and his monogram he had on his shirt. I put it there myself. - This is the description on the house where according to that man, Professor Cristaldi is being held. It's an abandoned house but he said that the professor can be seen through one of the windows on the first floor. Tonight I will go myself to try and rescue him. - I appreciate your information and your intentions but I made a promise to Professor Cristaldi. I must be the one to take care of this with the help of my friend. - Maybe I could help you. - You already did enough, sir. - All right then, I won't insist. (dramatic music) - This seems to be another trap, Santo. Is that him? - Mm-hmm, yes, that is Professor Cristaldi. Without a doubt. - Let's go. - Wait a minute, Demon. Let's not both fall into a trap. You better wait here. My transmitter will be active in case I need help. (transmitter beeps) Professor Cristaldi! Professor Cristaldi! (door creaks) (transmitter beeping) (suspenseful music) (grunts) What's wrong, Professor Cristaldi? (groans) Professor Cristaldi! Professor Cristaldi! (groans) What's going on? (objects thuds against head) (Santo groans) (body thuds on floor) (suspenseful music) (clanking) (footsteps tap) (Santo groans) Where is he? - Who? - Professor Cristaldi. - What happened to you? - I saw the professor or rather some kind of zombie acting like a machine. Then someone hit me. But where is he? - I'm going to bed. - Oh wait, I was asking Rufus to join me for a little walk in the garden. Do you think you could stay and watch the phone for me? We won't be long. - All right, I'll stay. - I'll see you later. No need for goodbyes. (Werewolf howls) (Laura screaming) (flesh squelching) (Werewolf snarls) - You're the house gardener, right? - Yes, commander, that's me, sir. - They told me you saw them leave the house. - Yes, sir, they left the house together and went into the forest. - And you didn't see them return? - No, sir. It was already late and I went to bed. - The blood was found somewhere in the woods. It wasn't animal blood, it was human blood. We're watching around Rufus's apartment just in case he goes back there. On the other hand, the mob boss swears he hasn't seen a man matching Rufus's description. The one who hired him is more or less as you describe, a hunchback. I hope this is nothing more than a simple escape planned by your cousin with this man named Rufus. - You have completed your part of our vengeance. Satan will be happy with you. Next is the part I must execute. Laura Castaldi is already in the living dead cavern and will only leave there to bring her own daughter back. As for the girl named Lina, I'll do something different. I will convert her into one of our own kind, and she will be my slave for all eternity. (bright music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (water flowing) (hisses) - Lina? Lina? (suspenseful music) I was worried. I looked for you all over the house. Why are you here? - I don't know, suddenly I felt an irresistible desire to come here. (ominous music) (growls) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (bat shrieks) (wings flap) (dramatic music) - Josefina is already one of us. She will bring the girl. As for Lina, I will bring her from him. - And the masked men? - They don't matter to me. You and your brethren make sure they do not get in my way. - Yes, Master. (ominous music) (moans) - Hmm. (dramatic music) - [Dracula Voiceover] Lina, the time has come. I have chosen you because tonight your body and your soul will have joined the legion of the undead. Do you hear me? - Yes, I hear you. - [Dracula Voiceover] Come, come. Nothing can stop you. - I'm coming. - Hmm. No. (sighs) I'll be in the library to look again at all the documents of Professor Cristaldi. We're still in the dark in this situation. I hope I can find some clue. Please stand watch here but don't ask me what to look out for because I don't know. - When you speak more than 10 words together, I can tell you are worried. - Of course I am. (ominous music) - Lina, where are you going? Lina! (water flowing) - [Dracula Voiceover] Josefina, Josefina, bring Cristaldi's granddaughter to me. - Yes, Master. (ominous music) - Lina! (all grunting) (dramatic music) - Rosita. Rosita, wake up. Wake up, Rosita. (groans) - Josefina, did you wake me up? - Yes, honey. Come on, quickly, get dressed, babe. Your mom is waiting for us. Let's go. (clattering) Hmm, hmm, hmm. (ominous music) - Josefina, where are you? - Here in the hall. Come. Come to me. (ominous music) (water flowing) - Josefina! Josefina! (gasps) - [Professor Cristaldi Voiceover] This dagger is the weapon than can be used to fight against hellish beings. - Hmm, hmm. (dramatic music) Blue Demon, Blue Demon? (ominous music) Blue Demon! Lina? Lina? Lina? (water flowing) What happened to you, Mr. Alivero? - Someone hit me in the head. - Neither Rosita nor Lina are in the house. - I saw Miss Lina going out. Walking into the forest. And then Josefina went out with Rosita too. I was going to ask them where they were going when I was hit on the head. - Did you see Blue Demon as well? - Yes, he left after Miss Lina. (groans) (transmitter beeps) - Come in, Blue Demon. Tell me, are Lina and Rosita with you? - I'm chained in a cave that is under the abandoned forest house. You can enter through a false door hidden in one room. (gasps) - If you go straight through this path, you will see the forest house. (ominous music) (door creaks) - I have come to your call. - Welcome to my house. You will never leave. To the bedroom. And once there, wake her up. I want her to wait for me in a state of full awareness. (growls) (ominous music) (gasps) - Where are we? Who are you? (women growling) (dramatic music) (screams) (sobbing) Let me out! (door creaks) - You wait here. I'll bring your mom. - Don't leave me alone! I'm scared! - Obey me, I told you to wait! - Mommy, Mommy? I'm scared, where are you? (whimpering) (door knob clatters) Open the door! - (groans) Hmm. Uh, mm-hmm. - Let Laura Cristaldi out of the living dead cavern. The place where death is not peace. No peace. But rather horror and endless pain. (door creaks and slams) (ominous music) - Mommy, Mommy! I'm very scared! (screams) (dramatic music) (growls) Grandpa, what's wrong? What happened to you? Grandpa? (Professor Cristaldi groans) Grandpa? (cries) (dramatic music) Mommy! Josefina brought me here and left me. Your hand is very cold. (whimpering) (dramatic music) (door clacks and creaks) (gentle music) - Ah, in our last two encounters you were hypnotized. Surely you do not remember me. I am Count Dracula. Look in my eyes. It will be easier for you. (ominous music) (gasps) (dramatic music) (gasps) Soon you will be a vampire like me. No mirror will show your image. (hisses) (knock on door) How dare you? - Sorry, Master. But Santo is on his way here with the Boidros Dagger. He already killed two werewolves. One of them managed to escape and brought the news. - You are human. That dagger holds no power over you. Attack Santo and steal it. I'm going to the cave. - Mm-hmm. (lock clacks) (dramatic music) (door creaks) - Mom, this place is really awful. I'm so scared. Why don't we go home? Mom, I'm dropped my doll! (gasps) Mommy, wait for me! Don't leave me alone! (door creaks) Mom, Mom, please open! (whimpering) (door knob clatters) (grunting) (banging against door) (grunting) (window shatters) (groans) (glass shatters) (ominous music) (coughing) (exhales) (grunts) (dramatic music) - With this dagger, Dracula and Rufus are at your mercy. Make them give you their enormous treasures and then kill them. It's your moment to shine, Eric. Make use of it. (whimpering) (gasps (gasps and screams) Don't be scared, Miss Cristaldi. I just want to ask you a question. If you answer it, I promise I'll help you escape. - What do you want to know? - This is the dagger of the Boidros. I know it has great powers but I don't know how to use it. Do you have any idea? - My uncle had it on his shelf when I was a child and it was always harmless. - Yes, it is harmless to humans but ah. (Eric gasps) (screams) (groaning) I've committed so many crimes that I stopped being human. (dramatic music) (gasping) (whimpering) - Santo! Santo, Santo, Santo! What happened to you? (Santo groans) How do you feel? Santo, are you all right? - This is the coward that ran away from Santo? - Yes, Master. - You know the punishment this deserves. Do it. - Come. (growling) (dramatic music) (grunts) - Rufus! You Bastard! - Now I want you to walk through this plank. Manage to get to me, I will spare you and you'll receive no punishment. (growling) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (werewolf shrieks) (dramatic music) (grunts) - What do you know about Rosita and Josefina and Blue Demon? - I don't know, why do you ask me? Are they not in the house? - (sighs) They are here. There's a cavern under the house. Do you know how to get in? - I'm telling you, I don't know. - Then please go home and wait there. Go, I don't want anymore problems. - Please Santo, let me stay with you. - You already helped me twice, Lina. Now go back home. (door creaks) - It's your turn. You will do the same walk but with your hands tied behind your back. (suspenseful music) - Hmm. (werewolves growling) (Blue Demon grunting) (Santo grunts) (fist whacks against head) (foot thuds against body) (werewolf growls) (werewolf growls) (werewolves growl) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (foot thuds against face) (all grunting) (fist whacking) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) - Santo! (objects thuds against body) Santo! - Rosita, wait! Don't walk there! (men grunting) - Santo! - Don't move! (fist whacks against face) Wait, Rosita! (men grunting) - Rosita! - Lina, if you got in here, you can get out. Take the girl, leave! (both grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) - Go. (all grunting) (fist whacks against face) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (fists whacking) (foot thuds against head) (both grunting) (fists whacking) (grunting) (foot thuds against body) (grunting) - Damn you! What did you do with Laura Cristaldi? - I killed her and now she is a living corpse! (fist whacks against face) (both grunting) (man screams) (body bangs on spikes) (snarls) (fist whacks against face) (dramatic music) (snarls) (foot thuds against body) (Blue Demon groans) (fist whacks against face) (foot thuds against face) (all grunting) (fists whacks against face) (snarls) (spear whooshes) (snarls) (thunderous boom) (snarls) (dramatic music) (speak whooshes) (snarls) (both grunting) (fists whacking) (dramatic music) (snarls) (dramatic music) (Werewolf growls) - Santo! (both shriek) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (thunderous boom) Look at that. - Now that the evil creature that gave them life perished they have returned to the ward of the dead. They can rest in peace. Let's go with Lina. (gasps) Santo! - Poor girl. She lived a horrible experience. - What should we tell her when she wakes up? - That everything was a dream. - Hmm, more like a nightmare. - Now we need to rest. We have a match tomorrow. (crowd cheering) - Renato el Hippie tries a sneak attack but fails. And now he's against Angel Blanco, stopping him in his tracks! Blue Demon attacks the stomach and now his partner and him do a a starhead collision! Now Santo and Blue Demon are using a side death leg lock on both rivals with all their might! But they break the lock. Ooh, Renato punches Santo! Santo had the advantage seconds ago but now is mercilessly changing blows with Renato el Hippie. So many terrifying blows! And the crowd keeps cheering as Angel Blanco tries to put Blue Demon in a cobra twist! Oh, great rescue by Santo! Your eyes just go side to side when these four great gladiators fight! Santo's using all his strength. Santo, a star amongst stars accompanied by Blue Demon, another great man! They're facing another incredible tag team of brutes. Look at that, look at that barbaric punch! Hitting in a way that only God could understand. Santo and Blue Demon now must go back to using legal moves because they were starting to use illegal ones and that's technicals, they can't do that. It's forbidden to hit the face or below the belt with closed fist. All those are banned moves! And now Santo is in danger of losing! (all grunting) (crowd cheering) That arm bar is really strong. Can Santo get out of there? Referee Ranquel is close to the action. Meanwhile, Blue Demon applies a double arm bar of his own! Oh, Santo is punishing Angel Blanco! This match is very important for both teams. An even match so far. The action doesn't stop. And we can't know which of the two teams will triumph. But so far, they are tied. What an incredible fight! Blue Demon are already exhausted from the effort needed against their challengers. Good rescue. Now the opponents have changed in order to try and find a way to beat them. (fist whacks against face) Ooh! The attacks keep coming. No one remembers who they started the match with. And now Blue Demon is having trouble with Angel Blanco! Santo now applies a great whip throw after a rope down to Renato el Hippie. And there he goes again! Santo goes on the attack. He wants to eliminate Renato. And now Blue Demon is being punished by Angel Blanco. Meanwhile, Blue Demon is in danger but now Santo's eliminated El Hippie! It's Blue Demon's turn! Here he goes! Oh! He awaits the bounce from the ropes and hits Angel Blanco with a heavy backdrop! Blue Demon is using a scissor pin! Santo, the crowd idol, and Blue Demon, his brother in arms, have won another great battle! Evil has been overcome. (crowd cheering) Our heroes win again.
