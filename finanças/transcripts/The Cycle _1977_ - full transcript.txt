Give it to him, you'll take it when you leave. Pull up your sleeve, get ready. - Why? What are you going to do? - Take your blood. There is no blood to give. - What's got in to you? - I've been ill for two years. Find a vein. - Don't play at being ill. - Believe me, there's no blood to give. - Abbas, what's wrong with him? - I have no blood to give. - So why are you here? - You said, "We'll give you money..." We don't give it for nothing. Take off your jacket. Throw him out. I've had enough! "We'll give you money", "We'll..." Hussain, find the vein. Mr. Sameri, your man is useless. He is ill. What's the matter? He said, "Give your blood", but what blood? I haven't got any to give. Come along, take off your jacket. Hurry up, Hussein! This bottle is full, bring another! He's fainted. What's going on? Feel better? Get up, and go out there. You drove a hundred secret arrows into my heart. Yet you ask why my skin has turned yellow. You, who knows all about me, why feign ignorance? Oh, I'm your slave, I am all devotion. I'm your servant. Sit down, I told you to take it off. He hasn't anymore blood. You gave it half an hour ago. He came yesterday, the day before, and he will go to six other places. He's a regular client. Let him go. Forget it, he hasn't any blood. What medicine did they give you? - Did they give you any? - No. He gave two bottles. Your father is really ill. Here's a letter of introduction. Get him to a hospital. Thank you, sir. Thirty-Five tomans for two bottles of blood. And five tomans for Abbas's commission. - It didn't hurt? - No. Your tough! Karim, give him a card. - Come and see us often. - Sure. Go to the hospital, they'll look after you. - How many? - Two. - Give it to me. - Keep off! Where's section 4? Good morning, may God bless you! Help me. because I'm on my last legs. Come in. Gentlemen, what are you looking for? Come with me. The old man is ill. Come over here. - What is it? - I'm sick. - Out. - Wait outside. - Your age? - About sixty-five, sixty-six. Your bowels working? What you want son? Son of a bitch... where are you? You go off and leave me alone. Help. Please help me. What's the matter? C'mon, get up. What's going on? Where should I go? Help me. Follow me... you too, son. Your father is not at all well. He needs electric treatment. - Mrs. - Yes? I can make an appointment for ten days later, - The old man will be dead by then. - I can't do anything for him. C'mon. - Nurse, Dr. Davoudzadeh? - Room N. 403. Stop crowding, each on in turn. That's mine. Now it's your turn. You had two! - Excuse me Dr. may I? - Wait. Oh. Miss Zahra... Forgive me for interrupting. Have some grapes. Careful, don't let them fall... - What is it? - Dr. this old man is a relative, he is ill. May God forgive you old man. - Why not go to the consultation? - His appointment is in ten days. That's why I'm bothering you. - What can I do? If it's for you... - A phonecall for you Dr. What? Patient on bed 38? Does he have a fever? Ok. I'm coming. - Doctor? - Please make an appontment for tomorrow. Any problem, come and see me. May God and his Saints protect you. Come on, let's go. - Did Dr. Jvaheri see her this morning? - Yes, he saw her but he didn't say anything. Don't worry little lady... Give her a transaminase, a Bilirubin... - .. And a serum. Put her in quarantine. - Ok Dr. You will have a love affair that will rock your world. It's certainly Zolleika. - Who is she? - The sexy one. Dr. Javaheri! You saw the patient in bed 38? I visited her this morning, she was doing well. But she's pretty bad now. Jaundice and high fever. Impossible. Perhaps, it's due to her choleostitis? I'm saying high fever. It's because of the blood. The infected blood that we got from that bastard Sameri. This is not his first time. Just a moment, I want to talk to you. Why is nitpicking so much? - I can find a better one. - Of course you can. - How much do you sell those bottles for? - Two, three, five. We've got various prices. - Is that flower fake or real? - It's real. Let me see. What a smell, what do you do to keep it so fresh? Hey, you. I'm talking to you, come here! - Thank you ma'am. - Give me that. Well, he is in a hurry. He must be hungry. - I'll come back for the sauce pan. - Thank you. Careful father, you will choke. - What's the matter? - I swear it's my first mouthful. - Have you had enough? - Yes. Ok. Fetch the sauce pan. - What do you do? - Nothing. - Your father. - He's here. - He's asleep, you want to cme in? - Jump over the railing. - Where are you going, son of a bitch? - The lady told me to go over with her. Come over here. - What's your name? - Ali. - Where do you come from? - Around... - What do you do? - Nothing. - How old are you? - Seventeen or eighteen. What are you doing? Hurry up... There is no one on the ward. Why keep nagging about the ward? I'm going there. Do you like the hospital? I like it, it's a real mess... The bastard, the swine! I'm going to get rid of them all... They sit on their asses and get fat. - What is it Mr. Emami? - Lazy swine. All those bastards have gone. There's no one to send, to fetch The eggs and chickens. Send Ismal. That bastard thief? To steal half of them? And then say he's not responsible? Hello! Is that him? Who did you say he is? - My nephew. - Got any brain? Can he go with Ismal? - Of course, why not? - Just a minute. You'll go with the car and be back soon. - you'll earn some cash, alright? - But my father? I'll tell him. I fixed it. I called and he's coming over. - Come here, what's your name? - Ali. At least I hope in the name of Ali, that you're not a thief. "The Imaginary Bird". You'll pick up twenty boxes like that. - Can you count? - Yes. Twenty boxes and one hundred chickens. Look! Keep an eye on that son of a whore. I don't trust him. Oh, Shit! - What? - I said OK. I tried to, but I couldn't talk to him. The poor man asked me... - .. To give him a message, can you do it? - Ismal, take this order and go to the Poultry. You'll go with him and hurry up. - Who are you? - Zahra's nephew. Zahra's nephew? Have you been sent to spy on me? I don't know. When someone older asks questions... Answer properly! - Are you going to work in the store? - I don't know. Idiots like you, are what Emami needs. He can pocket what he likes, that bastard! - What are you doing? - Afraid, are you? Some hero! How are you, Djan Ali? Twenty boxes of eggs, one hundred chickens. - Where's the boss? - Over there, by the pool. Don't keep me waiting. I wasted two hours getting here. One hundred twenty-three acres of land, he must make a fortune. And real estate goes up everyday! - Are the chickens here? - Yes, that's only of the buildings. It's enormous. There's one this side, and another there. Hello boss. Be careful. Throw them in gently. - Boss, isn't there any other way? - No. Their sale price is fixed. But the price of their food keeps rising like mad. - What would you do in my place? - I don't know. - Only twenty boxes of eggs? - I don't know, it's an order. Twenty boxes! For a hospital that size! They wont feed many. Goodbye. Those bastards! Just think what they will pour over them... - Where are you? - With Ismal. You had no right! - So you leave me and go off? - What happened? What happened. You good for nothing! I've been waiting for three hours, I'm starving. - Did you bring something? - No, Nothing. Nothing? Give it to me quickly! The money. What money? Give me some cash, to buy you food. - Must I give you my few pennies for food? - What are you looking at? I'm waiting for zahra to come. - How would you know she will come? - She must realize ... .. That I'm hungry. - Why should she? - Get moving, hurry up. - Where? - Go and ask her for food. Are you crazy, now? At this time? They will never let me in. You go on, ask her for some soup and rice. I didn't think he would disappear. - Now where do I take this poor man? - Find someone else. She's worked here all her life ... And still afraid of a corpse! - What are you doing here? - My father's hungry. I've come for food ... Well, come here ... Is he dead? Go downstairs. Where are we? Will this do? Poor man, he suffered ... I feel so sorry for him ... He would only eat from my hand. There now, don't cry! Did you have electric treatment father? Come and look after your father. Must go, there's an emergency... I'm dying, let me sit down. I'm thirsty. - Do you want some water? - Water? No I prefer some hot tea. - Where can I find hot tea? - Hot tea? Here's some I'll pour it for you. Thanks. may God give it back to you. You, come overe here! - Where are you from? - Around ... - You're allowed in? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Find Miss Nedjat in ward 11, give her this. - Ok. - In this hospital? Miss Nedjat? - Yes. - That's for you; you will get the rest later. - Alright. - Miss Nedjat? - Second floor. Miss Nedjat please. - Go staight and then go left. - Thank you Madam. - Miss Nedjat? - Yes. What shall I say? Tell him go to hell. Tell him that if he comes heere one more time, ... .. I will call the police. I'm coming. - Why are you still here? - But he must tip me. I don't care. If I say that, instead of a tip ... He will slap me in the face. Suppose I say you told him to wait. And let him wait until he fucks his ass off. No, no way. - Just tel him what I said, quick now. - At your service. You're much better; you've no temperature at all. Goodbye. You still there, talking nonsense. Let them speak. - Do you mean that ...? - No, but why was this department formed? - Who suggested the new building? - Who cares! This man thinks he was the only one ... Excuse me, fo you recall that afternoon when ... I'm sorry but it was me who suggested ... For twelve years I've had my patients in that damp basement. I've had enough! I've repeated endlessly, lets get together here. You see? he keeps interrupting. Gentlemen, you are all doctors. You know infectious diseases need sun more... Than the others. Why are you leaving? Because you've all missed the point. Sitting here fighting about a building not yet built. We are not fighting, we are ... Do you realize another patient has yellow fever ...? Because of that bastard Sameri's bad blood ... And she's dying, do you know that? Always the same old tune! Yes, because a gang of thieves ... Careful now, c'mon doctor. Careful? We are talking. Aren't we? If only he gave us healthy blood. I entirely agree with this. But I say we must prove it. Prove what? Just take a look over there, she is dying. Don't you understand? Had a blood unit ever been tasted ... To see what's in it? No. And why not? Because it needs laboratory. I know the labels are fake. - What the hell are you talking about? - Now, now, please! It's impossible. Excuse me, it seems the problem is not ... Whether this man supports infected blood or not. The real problem is only eight hundred drug addicts ... Supply the blood of this country. Supposed we don't accept Sameri's blood. From whom do the other labs get their blood? Neither from you nor me. But those eight hundred addicts. So that's the reason I said we need our laboratory. - Its not that easy. - Where will you get your donors? From us, you, me, him ... A small and simple laboratory will do. So people can give their blood in healthy conditions. Under our supervision. He's right. - What do you mean, he's right? - Don't you agree with us Dr. Rahimi? He's been dreaming for ages. Talk to the chief, I'm sure he will agree. I suggest that at the next meeting ... The matter be discussed and voted. Next morning: Wednesday at 9 A.M. What's the point of voting? Just talk to the chief. Get a verbal permission; I assure you its enough. But we need a budget. But sir we don't need much. We still need a budget. Well, talk to the chief. I'll do it. I have to see him on Tuesday. Good doctor. All we needed was a laboratory! But tell me, how much are you making out of it. Seyyed Bagher in x-rays is not bad. But she's crazy about you! - Marry her, she can be both ... - A mattress and a blanket! - Don't you want to marry him? - Certainly, they never stop pestering me! - Mr. Ismal, who's motor is this? - The cook Hasani's. - Can I try it? - You know how? Sure, I worked for a bike repairman. I'll just go for a ride. Wait a minute! - Who said you could take this bike? - It runs really well! Hurry up! - Where are we going? - C'mon, I'll tell you. Hello, beautiful! Oh! What an appetite! Have some, eat! - Is that him? - How's everything, you bum? Say, she is a good piece of ass! And she's so fond of you. She kept on at me to find you a job. That's why I'll marry her one of these days! Stop the nonsense, and get down to business. From now on, you'll be a business man on the lower side. Ismal will take you there. You spread put your goods and sell food. I'll give you a stove, twenty bowls, a tray ... Two barrels of rice. You light the stove and sell each bowl ... 2, 3, or 5 rials. But for your aunt's sake, don't cheat! Your accounts must be clear. Now get in, we must go. Just a kiss. What are you looking like that for? Get the hell out of here! Come and taste the good rice I've brought! For 2 rials, only 2 rials! Don't push, just a minute ... A bowl for 2 rials. I'll be back at the end of the day. Careul not to get robbed. Don't worry. Come, you miserable hungry men. - You need help? - Sure. You serve. I'll take the money. Hey you, Prince. I'm talking to you. - You call that rice? - What's wrong with it? - Everything! Sure it's rice? - Get out of here! Give me that, hurry up serving them ... Hurry along, all you miserable, hungry men! Fill up for only 2 rials. - Hey Mr. Ricey! Have you sold all your rice? -Yes, you can deep dead, it's all sold! God will make you regret it! Get the hell out of here! Why? I've been watching you for 2 hours. - I'm not a dog, why throw me a bone? - Just beat it! I've been waiting for 2 hours. You could at least give me a lousy bite! Pay, if you want a lousy bite! Where is it? If I had any I'd give it to you. - You can afoord it! - Give him a bowl, sit there. You could have done that sooner. - Give me some rice, may God bless you! - Money, You eat if you pay, if not beat it! But I've no money! If you want a bite, Pay or Beat it! But I'm hungry and I've no money. Quite, Listen to me. Do you want to earn money? A lot of money ... Now listen to me, there's a place ... Where they take a few drops of blood ... And pay you 20 toomans. 20 toomans a bottle. 2 bottles = 40 toomans. I've done it a hundred times! Oh, get out of here! Who has blood to give? If you don't want to, too bad for you. How miuch did you say? 20 toomans for only two drops of blood! It's nothing. You don't pay more? Why don't you shut up, Can't you see I'm talking? 40 toomans for 2 bottles. 40 toomans! - You want to go? I'll take you. - I'll come too. - Me too. Where is it? - I'll take you there and back. If your obedient servant, I'll come too. But I'm at your service. Take their name and give them ... a bowl of rice on me. I'll be back. Your name? But the transport is at your expense, sir. Alright, tomorrow at 6 AM. Aright, there is room for every one. Ghader, get them in. Get your asses mioving. Alright, everyone's aboard. Salam Alaikum Mr. Sameri, 25. You want to count? Count them yourself, and show them in. Alright, I'll get them in. Sir, Some are strong. You can give them a card. - Is that him? - We brought him here, now look! Look at this one, Doctor. This one's even got medals. From 4 countries, Doctor. What is it Abbas? Asghar, Why have you stopped? Back to work. Get up! Quick Chah Gholam, Line them up. Hey you! Here a minute! You bastard! You moving I on us? Son of a bitch! Leave me alone! - What's going on? - How can we work like this ... - If every son of a bitch brings his crew? - What do you care? - We've been slaving here for 2 years. - But, not for nothing! Go back to work, you too. Haven't you anything better to do? Come in. Hello! Where the hell were you? I've sent messages every where all day. Get on with it... what happened? Davoudzadeh, stupid! What? Again? Who does he think he is? Listen to me. Tell Babaiee to call me. Hurry up. That bastard thinks he can do anything! Sit down. Is that you Doctor? Sir! Salam Alaikum Its Sameri But of course, Doctor! Allow me to send you two cases of fish. They are so fresh; it would be a pity not to taste them. I only did my duty sir, dear sir. I just wanted ask you... about Dr. Davoudzadeh. That's what I meant to say... As you like, at your service. Thank you, Goodbye sir! I know him Doctor. - What? - I've been to his consultation with Ismal. He is real quack! That means? Well, its obvious. He says awful things about you. - About me? - Yes. - What? - That all your blood is infected. That you add water, sugar, and salt to it. That bastard! In my opinion, sir. what you're doing is useless. You've got a losing hand. So that greenhorn is teaching me! - But there's a better way. - Karim, get the drinks. Rather than send fish and gifte... Let Davoudzadeh do as he likes. - What? - Yes. I know he wants to close your business and set up his own. You tell me to let him install his laboratory? Yes, let him start and then play your cards. Just a minute, then what do I do? Exactly what he's doing to you! Make him lose face. You bribe some of his employees. Add 5 or 6 bottles of infected blood to his stock. 3 or 4 people die, then he's had it. - Right? - Noe. And then you take back his laboratory. It's not as easy as you think. - A drink? - No thank you, Boss. - Haven't tried before? - Yes, once or twice. But this is different! Down the hatch! Cheers! - What do you do? - All sorts of things. Like what? At noon I sell left over-rice on the lower side... Find taxies for patients... Jobs like that. - Ever dealt on the black market. - No, no! - Afraid? I wouldn't tell on you. - I wouldn't know how. - And if you did know... - Don't know perhaps I would... You son of a bitch! Listen... You should leave what you're doing and only work for me. - Doing what? - Only work in my office. No, Boss. On the contrary I need those jobs to get clients. - It's a waste of time. - I can work it out. Sure? You're a real son of a bitch! Well, Lets see... - How about payment? - The same as today. How about a monthly... Salary? No, It's better for you this way. I work harder, and get more clients... Waht a crafty bastard! Well, I must go now. No! Just stay a minute. Father's waiting. Fuck your father! What's so funny? You wanted to see me? Why? I've got to know your name. It's Derakhshan. So, You're the one? - Why? - Nothing. How do you know my name? - Having fun, kids? - Excuse me. Well, if it's not my sexy Aunty Zahra! I had it repaired, it runs beautifully now. Come on. Come on. What a mess! Salam Alaikum. Doctor. I'd like to know if you've got any guts. - Can you take it out? - Outside the hospital? - Does it work? - Yes, I've tried it. But we should cover it up so it can't be seen. Careful, the handles caught. Tighten it, so it can't get loose. Pull... tie a knot. Not too tight or the wood will come off. What a shelter! It's wonderful! Careful of your feet! I'll make some tea... Hey, Stop making that dust. Can't you see we've a high-class tea-shop here? - Here you are Ismal. - Thanks, so it's ready now. It's good tea. And no credit, old man. You take me for a fool? You've enough tea and sugar for a day or two. You keep what you earn. When you've made enough to buy another samovar... - You must return this to the hospital, where it belongs. OK? - OK. It's not so funny! - How many so far? - 123. 120! I counted them. 70+70+10= 120. Alright, as you say. 120 x 25 rials less 120 x 20 = 2400. And 5 x 120 = 600 rials = 3000. Make it 30 rials. - 25. - 30, please. And that's Mr. Ali's week's wage. How about a tip? - Salam Alaikum. - Salam Alaikum, please sit down. No thanks; I wonder if you talked to the chief about the lab. - What lab? - The blood lab. I just spoke to him. He quite agrees, but... The bills? I signed them. I signed them yesterday. I'm going to his office. This isn't my concern, take it to the Shakeri. I've told that idiot 100 times. Ok. Give it to me to sign. You make me sick and tired. You did say "but"... Let me make it clear. It can't be done in a flash. It requires through preparation. Preparation? We have already talked about it before. Of course. A blood Bank is quite essential. But it needs a budget, a project, it can't just... appear overnight. What do you mean it can't appear overnight? We've got everything we need. I've made a budget. Here are the figures. It won't cost over than 12000 Toomans. That's nothing for you. I even went emptied and cleaned the warehouse today. It has three perfect Rooms. One for Depoe Room, Two others for waiting room and lab. - What else do you want? - What you did there... I'm not against you... But Emami complaining you threw everything out. But who authorized you to empty the store? I did. What's the use of a few broken chairs? Gentlemen. Excuse the interruption; I'll have tea sent... A messenger brought this to the store room. Now they're sending warnings! - What's happening doc? - Nothing, Just drive! They must wait to set up 856 committees, meetings and other rubbish. If we rely on them, we'll have to wait until Dooms day. Two years on this project and it's not enough. They need another century. - What can we do? - We must do it ourselves. See that Emami doesn't put the rubbish back. Alright. Don't worry. Call me if you need me. Here, It's stamped. Last year's files haven't arrived yet. What? Are you joking? First you want a permit, then a seal... And now you say it isn't here at all! - Just keep calm! - I must find that file... To prove there was only rubbish in the store. They can't accuse me of stealing! Find it! - If I had it. I'd have given it to you. - Get moving. I'll do my best. Since you insist. - What a mess! - I must look, if it's there. I'll give it to you. Go ahead and look now! Oh! I found it! Here you are sir. Oh! Eternal Wheel ever running here and there is killing us. Enslavement in the whirling of the wheel is killing us. One denial and all these tribulations. Oh Death! Come. For life is killing us. Alright Doctor, within half an hour, I'll send the blood. I swear to God no one else could do it as quickly. Chah Gholam, Call Ali. Yes Doctor; It's to save lives that we're killing ourselves day and night. You should tell the Doctors that. And this bastard Davoudzadeh who's sneaking in on us... Judge for yourself... very well, Doctor. Ali, You go with Hussein to the Reza Tuptchi cafe. Beetle Reza and bald Mohammad are "A Negative". You know them? Two bottles from each and straight to the hospital. Hussein, How many red lights can you cross? Get it quickly! Take off your jackets, roll up your sleeves. Put your arm that way... Put your arm up! - Are you taking it here? - Yes, It's urgent. Don't worry, it's more comfortable here. Mr. Sameri only sends for us when he is in trouble. Don't upset yourself. Go on Hussein. Hussein, quicker! Stop right there. Give it to me. Here, 20 toomans for you and 20 for you. Give thanks to God! Out! Hussein, Put your foot down! Here's the "A Negative". Alfatiha, May God save his soul! Ungrateful bastard, not even a prayer for your father?! - Why hit me? Don't hit me Ismal! - You bastard, Son of a bitch, pimp... Don't hit me Ismal, I'll your father and mother! Just dare, you son of a bitch! You shit!
