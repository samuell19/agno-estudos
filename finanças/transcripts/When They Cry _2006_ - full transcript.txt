So three people were arrested for interfering with the police. The actions against the Hinamizawa Dam... ...have elevated since last month's bloody clash with the riot squad. - Bye-bye.I- See you. ...have elevated since last month's bloody clash with the riot squad. The police are on close watch for future extremist problems. Cabinet Minister Inukai was directly appealed to last week. Cabinet Minister Inukai was directly appealed to last week. Are you Toshiki Inukai? Toshiki Inukai - "Time Wasting" Chapter - Episode 01: HINAMIZAWA When They Cry Furimuita sono ushiro no (shoumen dare)? Kurayami ni tsume wo tatete (yoru wo hikisaita). Amadare wa chi no shizuku to natte nodo wo tsutai ochiru. Mou dokonimo kaeru basho ga nai nara... ...kono yubi tomare watashi no yubi ni. Sono yubi goto tsuretette ageru. Higurashi ga naku akazu no mori e. Atomodori wa mou dekinai. I am Mamoru Akasaka. I met that young girl due to one kidnapping case. About 48 hours ago, a Ministry of Construction official's son... ...the cabinet minister's grandson, was kidnapped. It's believed to settle this matter peacefully... ...the minister won't report it and will comply with demands. After monitoring the minister's phone... ...we've confirmed suspicious calls from outside the city... ...and a crime has indeed occurred. That's all. Please proceed with the utmost secrecy. Akasaka-kun. Go investigate the anti-dam group that petitioned the minister. Yes, sir. It's hard to believe this was done by a group of rural citizens... Mainichi Times Protest Against Dam Expands It's hard to believe this was done by a group of rural citizens... Mainichi Times Protest Against Dam Expands ...but we must eliminate all possibilities. Understood. Go straight there and canvass the local police. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. Worst case, I may not come back for the delivery. It's okay. Please don't worry and go. I'll be waiting for you with this baby. Onigafuchi Final Defense Alliance, huh... Normally, a rookie like me doesn't investigate alone. But because we're short-handed... ...and this group was judged to be far removed from this case... ...the higher-ups gave me this unusual role. Well, hello, hello. Thanks for coming all the way here. I apologize for suddenly visiting during your busy time. I'm Mamoru Akasaka of the national police. Nice to meet you. I'm Hondaya from public safety. Anti-gang chief Sankai browbeat me not to resist your assistance. Anti-gang? The prefecture police's anti-gang department? The Onigafuchi Final Defense Alliance is organized crime to us. It's unbelievable to call that a good-willed citizens' movement. Oh? Just when I wondered what you're talking about... Oh, Kura-chan. Nice timing. This is Akasaka-san, all the way from Tokyo's national police. Let me introduce you to Oishi-kun from investigations. He's familiar with the Onigafuchi people you're asking about. If you'd like, shall I give you a tour of the town? Yes, please. Oishi explained many things about Hinamizawa. No dam! Don't build the dam! Leave! You'll pay! Nature killers! No dam! Don't build the dam! Leave! You'll pay! Nature killers! Like its three great families. No dam! Don't build the dam! Leave! You'll pay! Nature killers! And how among them, the Sonozakis have absolute power. And how among them, the Sonozakis have absolute power. Sonozaki Sonozaki Their head, Oryou Sonozaki, is basically Hinamizawa's leader... Sonozaki ...who also leads the anti-dam movement. Sonozaki Their activities are escalating every year. You came all the way from Tokyo to investigate, right? Yes, that's right. Oh, then this involves the direct appeal to Minister Inukai? That means the Public Safety Department... ...decided to investigate here to keep an eye on the group? That you know why makes things easier. You're kidding, right? You're kidding that they're marked due to the appeal, right? You're horrible at keeping secrets, huh? I actually like your innocence and candidness. I thought I may be more helpful to you if you told me the truth. How would you be helpful? I could introduce you to people who know a lot about them. A spy? Yes. Why are you interested in my mission? Well, it's like a give-and-take situation. Yes. ~Hinamizawa Village~ See splendid nature! People needed. I see. ~Hinamizawa Village~ See splendid nature! People needed. No future opportunities... Are you here for a magazine or something? No, for personal reasons. Personal? For sightseeing? Yes, I read in a magazine that some precious nature is around. Then you should come! The village is a bit hectic, but we welcome you. Please let me do so. Thank you. Yes. Yes. Exit Cute. Mi. Mi. Mi? Mi... M-Mi... I'm not anyone strange. N-paa. N-N-paa... When They Cry When They Cry Well, hello! I'm sorry for being late. You're the sightseer who called yesterday, right? Oh, yes. Don't stand there. Please get on. The weather looks like it'll get bad again, so I'll give a quick tour. - Okay. - Mi. Hey, it's Rika-chan! What a blessing, what a blessing. N-paa. Makino, do you have work now? She calls him just "Makino"? The village headman asked me to show around... ...a young fellow who's coming to sightsee various places. Are you the young fellow who's sightseeing the village? Yes. I heard the nature here is quite precious... ...so I thought I'd love to take some pictures. You're Tomitake #2. Tomitake? N-paa. This is interesting to you? Well, I felt the kind of nostalgic feel it has gives a nice touch. Is Hinamizawa fun? Yes, it is fun. Once my wife's out of the hospital, I want to come back. With my newborn baby along. Well then, let me take you to the place with the best view last. The place with the best view? Why, of course. No other place can compare with the view from there. That means I can invite you to my home. Your home? It's the shrine, Furude Shrine. It's on high grounds, so you can get a great view from there. Furude Shrine? Rika Furude. One of the three great families... N-paa! This is... No dam! Oyashiro-sama curses you! We'll never approve! This is... No dam! Oyashiro-sama curses you! We'll never approve! This shrine is also the anti-dam movement's main office. But this is like the fight against the Japan-US Security Treaty. I'm actually not an activist, so... Fighting national policy with violence and locking selves in... I can't agree with that. I see that you have a fine opinion. If you want a say, vote for a politician with the same views... ...or jump into the world of politics and debate your point. That's the bedrock of democracy. I don't understand anything you're saying. Sorry, it was a difficult subject for you. Japan is a peaceful country... ...so if you have something to say, you have to do it peacefully. Then, Akasaka... ...what can this village do to not be submerged by the dam? We can only live here. We can't live in the city. Makino-san, is that the sightseer who called yesterday? Yes. This is Hinamizawa's village headman, Kimiyoshi. Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, huh... Welcome to Hinamizawa. How was it? Isn't it a quiet and calm place? Y-Yes, I enjoyed visiting many beautiful places the entire day. Well well, what a gentleman. Akasaka, over here. Hurry, hurry! Well then, excuse me. This is amazing. This is my favorite place. I can't believe such a beautiful village will be under a lake... It's not going to sink. The dam plan will definitely go away. I hope so. Akasaka, do you believe this village will sink? I don't want it to sink, but... It won't because the dam plan is going to be gone soon. - Gone? - Yes, it will be gone. How can you be so sure? Regardless of what you do, the dam plan will end this year. It's already been decided. Why do you think so? It's already been decided. There's no other way to put it. Even if you say it's been decided... That's dangerous, Rika-chan! Akasaka. Go back to Tokyo. It's best to go back to Tokyo quickly. Otherwise, you'll regret it very much. Regret? I have warned you. The rest is up to you. Who are you? You're not Rika-chan... Who are you? Rika-chan! Rika-chan... Rika-chan! Rika-chan... Mi. Mi! Then I'll leave the rest to Sato-san. Oishi-san, you're leaving? I'll just be in the way if I stay. Besides, you're the one who offered Sato-san the job. Well, let's go. You've heard about Hinamizawa from him, right? Yes, pretty much. Then let's get to it. Please. The Sonozakis had a family meeting last night. Family meeting? At the center was the Sonozaki family head, Oryou Sonozaki... ...her granddaughter, Mion, who's said to be the heir... ...and the leaders of the other great families. The Furude and Kimiyoshi families. In addition, there were several direct relatives. What was discussed at that meeting? Mainly stuff concerning the anti-dam movement... ...but the issue is what was discussed at the end. The end? I see. It was a tough one. What's the matter, Oryou-san? If for us, the land is our mother... ...then the dam is a disturbance that threatens our mother's life. I heard the grandson of the dam's minister has been kidnapped... ...and that it's causing chaos. We're even. That can't be. The kidnapping of Minister Inukai's grandson shouldn't be public. How do they know? Oryou-san, is that true? Our pain is the pain of losing our mother. I don't think it's completely similar... ...but he certainly deserves the pain of losing a grandchild. But there's a difference between the land and someone's child. I don't mind the kidnapping, but I don't want him to be injured. The child is innocent. Take care of him. So the Onigafuchi Final Defense Alliance... ...was involved in the kidnapping? We can't be completely certain. But the head, Oryou... ...gave orders on how to treat the kidnapped grandchild. We can't tell whether her words... ...were an order or just her personal thoughts. That's all Oryou said regarding the kidnapped grandchild. I hope you found some things you were concerned about. Buddy, I don't know what kind of work you do... ...but if you're facing the Sonozaki family, you'd better be prepared. Oishi's been attacked two or three times. He wore a knifeproof vest even on his days off, though not lately. A knifeproof vest? You ever been in the national police's public safety unit? No way... Then I'll tell you this out of courtesy... After the kidnapping case, another case came up. What? To investigate the grandchild's kidnapping... ...it's been said Tokyo's public safety sent an investigator. A public safety investigator? For the minister's grandchild. They can't blow it out of proportion... ...so public safety is said to be investigating it on their own. They're making such a fuss. What's wrong? Did the national police come? Oh, Rika-chan knows what the national police is, eh? Good girl. Who came? Does anyone know what kind of person came from public safety? A newbie is what I heard. A newbie? Is he freshly new? Yes, a newbie. A young, fresh newbie. Yes, he's young and fresh. What should we do, Mother? Leave it alone. But if he causes too much harm, then don't hesitate at that point. I don't like people fooling with me. A young, fresh newbie. Well, that's all I know. Just be careful. - Yes? - Is this Akasaka-san? Good morning. This is Oishi. Oh, hello. Did you just wake up? I have a story that may completely wake you up. Yes? Something interesting was sent to a station's lost and found. Lost and found? A wallet? Look at this. Medical Examination Card Toshiki Inukai And... Medical Examination Card Toshiki Inukai This was found in Takatsudo, which is a ghost town. It's such a lonely area. Oishi-san, could you take me to Takatsudo? Sure, no problem. What are you doing? A precaution. If you're taking risks, you'd better be properly prepared. Will you wear one too? To get my happiness, I had done everything... ...but had done nothing to be blamed and accused of. The sound of footsteps became louder every day. Then I noticed the fact there was no time. I was a believer in life, to be myself always. And was asking whether I would be alive. Give me a reason why not to adopt in this way. Or judge me to be guilty of so many incurable sins. Tell me why or why not? Complaining way too much. Maybe I overlooked something fatal for me. Preview Preview What is being sought is the unwavering image.
