Complete correction & synchronisation for Dr Sapirstein's Fan Edit by Fingersmaster Swan. He has no other name. His past is a mystery, but his work is already a legend. He wrote and produced his first gold record at 14. In the years since then, he's won so many others... ...that he once tried to deposit them in Fort Knox. He brought the blues to Britain. He brought Liverpool to America. He brought folk and rock together. His band, the Juicy Fruits... ...single-handedly gave birth to the nostalgia wave in the '70s. Now he's looking for the new sound of the spheres... ...to inaugurate his own Xanadu, his own Disneyland... ...the Paradise... ...the ultimate rock palace. This film is the story of that search, of that sound... ...of the man who made it... ...the girl who sang it... ...and the monster who stole it. Swan. You know, it just seems like yesterday I found Annette in that church choir. I got her singing lessons, I taught her how to dress. I got her first club job! And I paid off a columnist. He did a beautiful story on her. I told her who to be nice to, who to... I fed her drugs to get her through the road tours. I made her record a hit! Then I sold her to you. You made her the biggest thing in rock! So now what does she do? She fires us, cancels our Vegas date... ...and wants to give free concerts for starving gook orphans. She was more than a piece to me! She was the light of my life! And now she's gone. There'll be a 20-minute intermission before the next show. We sued her. We couldn't lose. We had her in an ironclad contract. It was a lock, it was over, it was closed. I even bribed the judge! He ruled against us. He said we couldn't sign anyone to a life contract. Said we were a disgrace to the profession. A disgrace, he said! I was the one that made her the moneygrubbing whore that she was, and he calls me a disgrace? What do you want me to do? Break her. - Is that all? - Isn't that enough? Annette is nothing, finished, washed up. But she's at the top of the charts. That's today, Philbin. Today. Tomorrow she'll be forgotten. Besides, we have more important business, you and I. The Paradise. I know, boss. We've looked everywhere. - You just don't seem to... - Listen! What? - That's it. - What? The music to open the Paradise. After all these years, I've finally found it. You want that creep to open the Paradise? No, not him. The music. Listen to the music. What do I do with him? You'll think of something. - Mr. Leach? - Hello. - Yeah. My name's Arnold Philbin. - Hello. Look, I scout talent for Swan. And, he's interested in your stuff. - The Swan? - That's right. He said your sound could be real big. - Did he really say that? - I was sitting right next to him. If Mr. Swan would produce my music, the whole world would listen to me! The game plan exactly, but you need a lot of work, a lot of polishing. I know, Mr. Philbin. I have a long way to go. Yeah, right. Now, do you have any tapes of your stuff? No, but it's all written down here. Well, why don't you give us just two or three of the really good up numbers. And... Two or three up numbers? You don't understand. The scope of this cantata is 200 or 300 pages long, and I haven't finished yet. Well, never mind the sonata. We just want the songs. It's not just songs. It's more. It's much more! - I don't get you, kid. - Well... It's a whole series of songs that tell the story of Faust. - Who? - Faust. What label's he on? Faust was a legendary German magician who sold his soul to the devil... for worldly experience and power. What is this, kid? School time? I got a plane to catch! Look, a song is a song. You either dig it, or you don't. Now, I like your stuff, kid. I think it's terrific. - And you know what? - What? I think the Juicy Fruits are gonna dig it. The Juicy Fruits ? I'm not promising anything. First... I'm not gonna let my music be mutilated by those greaseballs! - Relax, kid. - I'm the only one who can sing Faust! Relax, kid. It was just an idea. Swan makes all these decisions, you know? I'm sorry. I... It's just that I worked so hard on this thing. It's okay, kid. Boy, you sure got some temper. I'm sorry. I don't know what comes over me. It's all right. Just relax. Take it easy. Why don't you give me the music? Swan will take a look at it on the plane and we'll get right back to you. But if you ask me, I think we're gonna produce your first album. Really? Hello. I'm Winslow Leach. Yes ? Mr. Philbin said Mr. Swan was gonna call me about producing my first record... Mr. Philbin said he'd get right back to me. That was a month ago. One moment, please. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Follow that car! Where did you get that song? I got it from Philbin, to audition with. Sing it again. - Why? - Go ahead. Sing it. That's incredible! How'd you know it went like that? I wrote the song. If you wrote this stuff, then why aren't you in there with Swan auditioning the singers? I don't know. There must be some mix-up. Oh, sure... They must not know who you are. Your name's not on the music. That's funny. Swan heard me sing that song. Why's he auditioning girls for my cantata? I only sing it solo. - Haven't you heard? - What ? He's opening the Paradise with it. - You're kidding! - Do I look like a kidder? He's opening the Paradise with my cantata? Yes. Isn't that great? Gee, I wish he'd told me. He's just auditioning girls for a backup chorus. But you're a really fine singer. You shouldn't waste your time singing in a chorus. I don't care where I sing this music. Hey, look... Could you help me? I know I can sing these songs better than anybody. And with your help, I'm sure I can get a part in the chorus. Sure. I'd love to help you. You're not just doing this to be nice, are you? I would never let my personal desires influence my aesthetic judgment. What's that mean? It means I think you're terrific. Do you? All right. Let's everybody get in line. Gotta quick it up a little bit. Move in quietly. One, two, three, four... Come on, come on. Five, six, seven, eight... Wait a minute. Stop. What's that, a boyfriend? - I'm Winslow Leach, the composer. - That's great. - But Swan's only seeing girls today. Come on. - I know, but I have to see Mr... Don't give me a hard time. If you wanna see Swan, you get on the phone and you call and make an appointment, like everybody else. - I did that and they threw me out. - Well, then, they don't wanna see you. - But I wrote the music. - Look, why don't you just... get out of here! - Winslow, look, I'll tell him you're around here. - Go. - Okay. I'll wait for you. - Wait! Good luck. Why won't he just let me sing? - It was awful. - What's the matter? Philbin tried to... I just can't do it. Not that way. I came here to sing. - This didn't even sound like an audition. - Leave me alone! I'm sorry. Did you tell him who I am? What's your name? Hey! Come in here, buddy. Do you guys know where a good department store is? Yeah. We'll take you. We go. Right now. When do I get to sing? I don't think much singing goes on around here. I've been here 12 times, and I still don't get to sing. - I just get to come back. - What do you do here? You'll see. - Can't you sing on your back? - I've never tried. Well, if you can sing standing up, you can sing lying down. - Why don't you take your slip off? - No, I'm saving it for Swan! He won't miss anything if you do it now. You're being auditioned right now. - What do you mean? - The whole place is bugged. - You're kidding. - No. No. Swan's watching us right now! - Come here. - What are you doing? He likes to watch us. Watch us doing what? Doing each other. - Really? - That's how he gets turned on! - Does he like blondes? - I like blondes. Do you mind? I hate to bother you, but... That's right, I... Just hold me close. I just... I just need someone to help me warm my voice up. Swan! Swan! Mr. Swan, you remember me. I'm Winslow Leach. Let me be first! Over here, Swan. Get this fag out of here. Mr Swan, it's me. Winslow. Don't you remember? I gave Mr. Philbin a copy of my cantata. You know, Faust. You were supposed to look at it and do it. You're auditioning girls for my cantata. I'm Winslow Leach! I wrote it! Where are you going with me, buster? Hey, Swan ! Telephone. That's him! - What do you think you're doing? - Nothing. What are you, some kind of pervert? No, sir. I'm... I'm... I'm Winslow Leach, the composer. What are you doing outside of Swanage? Listen, officers, you gotta help me. Mr. Swan's got my music. And he's pretending he doesn't even know me. He had me thrown out of the mansion and beaten up! He didn't want to buy what you had to sell, did he? He didn't say anything about buying anything. Jack... what's that he got in his purse? I don't know, Joe. Why don't you take a look? I think I will. Mr. Swan said he had it on him. What do you know? Smack, Jack. Do you know what you could get for pushin' in this state? Life! But I'm innocent! Swan stole my music and framed me! Welcome to Sing Sing. We are very fortunate to be included here in the Dental Health Research Program. This is a volunteer program funded by the Swan Foundation. You are all volunteers. All your teeth will be pulled. Teeth are a source of infection. And it pays to be on the safe side. Sir? Pardon me. I'm not a volunteer. I'm innocent. I don't want you to take my teeth out. How many men here are innocent? Raise your hands. All innocent. And good morning, everybody. This is Windy Craig here on WCHD. Well, Swan has another golden disk to deposit in Fort Knox. His fabulous group, the Juicy Fruits on the Death Label has taken the charts by storm. And get this, kids, friday night, you can see the Juicy Fruits live at the grand opening of the Paradise! That's right! Swan's rock palace is scheduled to open at last, and with this dynamite sound! So let's hear it again. The Juicy Fruits singing Swan's Faust. Never! Get away from that record press! Ok. Let's move this ladder now. What's that? I take the tire and I shove it right in his mouth! Then he really gets mad at me, you know? Look! Right. Look, this is the last time we're gonna go through it. You see Swan up there? He's listening. He's watching this whole thing, so don't make me look bad again. All right. Watch the microphones. I want to see plenty of movement up there. Harold, you leave her alone! Put it down! All right, come on. Let's get going, will you please ? Come on. Let's get it going over here. Come on. That's it. Get the car over there. All right, girls. Just a second, Linda. You got a very nice body and everything, and you wear a bikini. We want to see some skin, Linda. It's cold. This is just a rehearsal. You're not getting paid to be cold, Linda. - Don't touch me, Philbin. - You wanna get paid? - Yeah, I wanna get paid. - Get back on the car. Come on, let's move it out of here. That's it. Come on. Let's get it on. That's it. We've gotta get some thin girls here. Where do you think you're you going? - Listen, man, I gotta get out of here. - What are you talking about? - Listen, what sign are you? - Leo. So what? Leo? You're okay. I gotta get out of here, man. - Come on. Come with me. - Listen, I can't... I wanna show you something. I swear to God. - Do you see Swan sittin' in that box up there? - Yeah, right. He doesn't show it or anything, but right now, he's thinking: "Why isn't Harold in the car?" Now, if he comes down here, do you really want me to tell him that it's not in the stars for you to ride off the stage in this car? No, Philbin. I just don't feel good, man. You're gonna feel a lot worse, Harold, if you don't do what I tell you. I got this headache and I hear this ticking going on, you know. Ticking ? Maybe something's loose up there. - No. There's something weird around here. - Here, take one of these. You have any water I can take these with? Just take the pills. Come on. Get it down. - Feeling better? - Yeah, I feel better, Philbin. I feel better. No more ticking? All right. Get out there. Come on, get this car out! Let's go! Come on! All right, girls. I want big smiles now. Look out at the audience. That's it. Big smiles. Sing the song. That's it! Why, Winslow! Good to see you. I've been looking for you everywhere. Killing me won't help you. My God, you're horrible. Don't rush off. Look at yourself. Look at yourself! What's that horrible sound you're making? Can't you talk? Look around you, Winslow. You've destroyed your face, your voice. Now you're trying to destroy the Paradise. Haven't we all had enough? I can give you the power to create again. I can make you somebody. We're gonna have to start all over again, Winslow. Only this time, working together instead of against each other. The time for your sound is now. People are going to want to hear your music. I mean what I say! Tomorrow, I'll put a whole new group together who'll do your songs your way. You don't have to believe me. Come to the auditions and see for yourself. Trust me! Trust me. Next! - What's your name, sweetheart? - Phoenix. Let's see what you got, Phoenix. Do I get to sing this time? You mean you're really a singer? Yes, I'm a singer. Try to forget it. We're not looking for singers. We're looking for screamers. I'm not a screamer. I'm a singer. Phoenix. Swan here. - I want you to answer a question for me. - Yes? What would you give me to sing? Anything you wanted. Anything? Would you give me... ...your voice? Try me. She's good,... ...isn't she? Then, let's talk. Filters. Dolbys. Perfect. How's that? Try it. Phoenix. Try it again. And again. At least you can talk with this. You can plug yourself into the console for singing. You really think she's that good? She's too good for you. I'll hire her anyway. She could be my voice now. Could she? Really? Yes. Then, let's get down to business. I want you to stop terrorising the Paradise, and rewrite your cantata... ...for Phoenix. That way we both get what we want. You get your cantata sung by the right singer, and I open Paradise. Rewrite my cantata ? We have no time to waste. Just one week. You must lock yourself up in here and do nothing but write. - Isn't this exciting? - I could write for her. Yes. We'll perform here live. And Phoenix... ...will star! My cantata... ...for her. I'll get fantastic musicians. The hall has great acoustics... I don't trust you, Swan. You've ruined my music before. Forget about the Juicy Fruits. Who wants nostalgia anymore? - I don't trust you. - You don't have to. Here's a contract. Everything I've said, and more, is in it. - I'll read it. - At your leisure. "The party of the first part gives the party of the second part, ... ...and his associates, ... ...full power to do with him, at their pleasure,... ...to rule, to send, to fetch, or carry him or his, be it either body, soul, flesh, blood or goods." What does that mean? That's a transportation clause. "All art... "All articles which are excluded shall be deemed included." What does that mean? That's a clause to protect you, Winslow. Anyway, what difference does it make? What choice do you have? I'll rewrite my cantata, but you'd best play what I write. Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow. Now, sign. Excellent. And now we're in business... ...together... ...forever. I'll rewrite my cantata, but you'd best play what I write. Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow. Now, sign. Excellent. And now we're in business, together... ...forever. Tasty, Winslow, tasty. I know, boss. But I thought you liked her. I do. She's perfect. But you know how I abhor perfection in anyone but myself. Then Phoenix is out? No, not out. Just a... ...backup singer. My cantata needs something really... ...heavy. No, no. Wrong. Wrong again. Pretty, but... no. No. There's something here like... Philbin... How come they get to shoot Swan and we don't even get to take any pictures of him? Because they've got exclusive rights to his life. Where's he coming in from? Transylvania. My boss will go anywhere for... I'll sue you! Remember, no pictures of Swan. Gentlemen, I want to tell you of our latest work. It's an opera. A kind of pop cantata. It was written by the late Winslow Leach. It tells a story of a young man who sells his soul to the devil... ...to become a pop star. It will be the first rock version of Faust. We'll be recording at the Paradise... ...Friday night... ...Live on the Death Label. Mr. Swan ? Mr Pizer. Yeah, Mr. Swan, who's gonna be singing this? The Juicy Fruits? No, no. They're a reflection of the past. Gentlemen, I give you the future: Beef. Winslow? Winslow. Good morning. What day is it? Thursday. Today is Thursday. Breakfast. A little pick-me-up. How's it coming? Don't mean to rush you, of course. Don't worry. It'll be finished. How's Phoenix doing? I can't wait to hear her sing. Phoenix is doing beautifully. Can't wait to meet you, by the way. Tomorrow night's the big night. Tomorrow night. Man, you better get yourself a castrato for this, 'cos it's a little out of my range. Something bothering you, Beef? Swan, this was scored for a chick! I'm not doing it in drag. You can sing it better than any bitch. You don't know how right you are, Goliath. Okay, boys, from the bridge. Hit it! Who says I can't sing it? I like it. Keep working on it. Drop an octave here, change a line there. Give it a beat. Make it completely yours. Let's go. Far out! Doesn't that kinda change the whole thing? You heard what he said. Make it yours! Lord, if it sounds good, nobody's gonna care what it's about! Is that so? - Nobody cares what anything's about. - Is that right? Who the hell listens to lyrics anyway? Dry up, tubbo. Seal it now. This creep gets no comps! My music! Swan! What was that? What was what? I knew I shouldn't be screwing around with a dead man's music. This place is... ...possessed. What are you talking about? You tryin' to tell me you didn't hear that shriek? That was something trying to get out of its premature grave. And I don't wanna be here when it does. Opening night prima donnas. Look, iron man, if you're so uptight, take a shower and cool off. My pleasure... ...Bones. Never sing my music again! Not here, not anywhere! Do you understand? Never again! My music is for Phoenix. Only she can sing it. Anyone else that tries... ...dies. All right, tickets. Come on, let's see your tickets. This is the tickets holders line. Everybody's got to have a ticket here. Everybody have a ticket? - You, you got a ticket? - Sure, I have a ticket. All right, get back in line. Take care of the rest of this line. Frank, open that gate. Where the hell do you think you're going, Tinkerbell? Cincinnati, to see my mother. You're gonna miss the show. - There ain't gonna be no show. - What? Listen, Philbin. There really is a phantom. He was just in my shower. He threatened my life! He said his music is just for Phoenix. Only she can sing it. Anyone else who tries... ...dies. What the hell are you talking about? Look, Philbin, I am a professional. I have been in this business a long time. Now, if I don't want to do a show, it's not because I got stage fright. It's because some creature from beyond doesn't want me to do the show! Now, gangway! Bullshit! Now how did that really happened? Can't you feel the vibes in your own house? Bad, sport, real bad. The karma's so thick around here, you need an Aqua Lung to breathe. - I know what it is. - Oh, you do, huh ? - Yeah, you wanna know what it is ? - Why don't you tell me what it is? Speed, that's what it is. - Speed! - Yeah! What do you know about it? You just pass the stuff out, I take it. I know drug-real from real-real. Do me a favor and take this. No, that'll bring me down! Listen, my friend, you better come down. You better get yourself together. You got a show to do. This is opening night. Can you still sing? - Sure, I can still sing. - All right. Help! The Phantom! Help! Somebody get a fire extinguisher! We want Beef! We want Beef! We want Beef! Somebody get rid of him. Phoenix, get out there and sing. You're crazy! Look, some maniac killed Beef so you could sing. Don't disappoint him, or else there'll be more bodies out there. Phoenix. Swan. Is Beef... ? Dead. But let's not talk about that. Let's... Let's talk about you. I like your name. We won't have to change it. You're going to be a very big star, Phoenix. We'll finish the cantata tomorrow night. We'll... ...we'll record, we'll go on tour, and then... There are no words to express what you're going to become. I'll do anything you want. I owe you everything. Just give me that crowd again. Tomorrow night. Tomorrow night, they'll be yours. Mine... And all I want... ...is your voice. Is that all? No. We'll go to Swanage and celebrate. I'll wait for you in the car. He wouldn't listen to me. Come on, where the hell is she? Philbin, have you ever seen such a crowd? No, and I never want to see another one. Look at them. They've really been entertained. They never want the show to stop. The Paradise is more magnificent than I ever dreamed. Sure! How often is a rock star fried on stage! Quite an attraction! Don't hurt me. I would never hurt you, Phoenix. You know me? I'm Winslow. Remember? But Winslow is dead. No, not quite. What do you mean? Who are you? Why do you wear that mask? Because Swan's taken my voice... ...my music... ...and given me this! And now he wants you! But you're all I have left! Phoenix, no one will sing in this Paradise again! No one's ever gonna sing my "Faust" again! No one but you! Phoenix, leave this place, or I'll destroy you too! You're crazy ! Why should I go with you? Don't you hear them down there? Why should I give that up? They want more now. They want much more. They want more than you could ever give! I'll give them whatever they want. No, Phoenix ! Get your hands off me! I'm telling you, with that freak on the loose, the Paradise is finished. The Paradise is just beginning. Tomorrow night, Phoenix will finish Faust. Look. Here she is. The freak that killed Beef is up on the roof. Philbin, appelle la police ! Don't think about it. Tonight is your night. And I won't have it ruined. Swanage. Winslow, what a foolish thing to do. Didn't you read your contract closely? See where it says "terms of agreement"? Can you read what it says? "This contract terminates with Swan." No more suicides, Winslow. You gave up your right to rest in peace when you signed this contract. What if you do find a loophole... Is that what you're thinking ? Forget it. That stays sealed only as long as I have the power to bind you. If I'm destroyed, that gaping wound opens. You might say we terminate together. Now, get back to work. We need a whole bunch of new love songs for Phoenix. If you as much as say boo... ...to anyone at the Paradise... ...you'll never see Phoenix again. No ! Oh, yes,... ...about the love songs,... ...perhaps a duet? Never! I'm under contract too. Hey, Swan ! Are we gonna get to shoot pictures of you tonight? What's this rumor you're gonna wear a mask on stage? How can we shoot you if you got a mask on, man? You can't, fools. Philbin, it was genius making the end of the opera... ...a wedding! You mean, Faust, instead of burning in hell, he gets the girl? Yes. And you, Philbin, will be the priest. I've never been a priest before. That's terrific! Swan, you remember me, don't you? But, you do, don't you? Swan ! Do you know him? Well, we went steady together in high school. You're kidding. You're old enough to be his mother. This was taken 20 years ago. My God! He doesn't look any different. Saturday... ...November 19, 1953. Today, I have decided to kill myself. And being the greatest showman of my time... ...I'm recording live for the Swan Archives. Why? Simple. I'm getting old. I can't bear... ...to see this beautiful face ravaged by the forces of time. If I can't be young forever... ...I'd rather end it all... ...now. Why not? What? Stay young forever. I'm real. And I'll leave, if you want. But you did call me. I... I didn't call anybody. You said you wanted to be young forever. Well, here I am. But I am stoned. You're not real. Then it really doesn't matter what happens, does it? What is going to happen? For openers, you're gonna look like me... ...forever. This is too much. I guess you're supposed to be the devil? I go by many names. And you will make me young forever? This image will age in your place. - This picture gets old instead of me? - Yes... And you must watch it every day, just to see how lucky you are. I'm crazy about pictures of myself. And the tape from which the picture comes... ...must be guarded at all costs. Why? When it goes, you go. What do I have to do? It's all here. Read it carefully. And then, sign at the bottom... ...in blood. Blood? My blood? Messy, I know. But... ...it's the only way I can bind you. Tradition. What do you have to lose? Nothing. I was gonna use this on my wrist. Your soul is damned either way. What soul? Don't waste it. Now sign. Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow. Now, sign. Just sign this, and it will all be legal. "Till death do us part"? - This is too much! - Come on, sign! You don't want to be late for your own funer... ...wedding, do you, girl? Don't you think we rushing things a little? - Blood! - Stop wasting it! Sign your name. P-H-O... Remember ! She must be hit just as Philbin says: "Till death do you part." Now, wait a minute... This may be not of my business or anything, but if you're gonna kill her, why do it here, tonight? An assassination live on television, coast-to-coast? That's entertainment! Look, they're coming! When it goes, you go. Do you, Phoenix, take Swan to be your wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health? I do. And do you, Swan, take Phoenix to be your wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health, till death... Oh, my God! Your face! What's happened to your face? Winslow ! I don't understand. Your voice, remember? You promised me your voice! Our contract, remember? Winslow.
