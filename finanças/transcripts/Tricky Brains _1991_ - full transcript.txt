Let's go, quick. How much longer you want to hide it from Kit? I don't know. I can't project his reaction. Who thinks of such an idea. The boss' daughter works as a clerk to know about the firm. It's very old fashioned idea. You decide on the contract. Fine. Hello! Lucy! Lucy! Hi! Daddy! Macky was talking about the Japan contract. Take you time, I have to get change. Lucy, you've changed after going to the States. We are busy. Lucy, I wanna talk to you. What, Daddy? Heard that you & Kit are going out. Well, you are undercover to work in the firm to have a clear picture, I don't mind. But be careful with your love life. Who? You overheard us. Sorry, I was going to say, but no chance. Talk now. Kit is not a good fellow. Mind your word. I know it's been a long time. But a like fair chance. I worry about you. What do you know? Kit has a bad background. He joined triad since young. And then back to school. So he has turned good. People can never change their character. He is interested in your money. He doesn't know my identity. I will pretend not knowing too. Mind you. You are blinded by your love. You'll soon see the real him. " Am sick for love."‚Äù Chi! Something wrong? Remember before your wife died, one day I told you I was pregnant. Yeah, and I borrowed some money for you. Told you to have the abortion. I feel sorry now. I had lied to you. What? That's not my baby? Of course it's your baby. I didn't have the abortion. I gave birth in China and my sister takes care of him. So I have a second son. He has got a single entry visa. True? He is really like you. I take you to him. Good. He stays here? How does he behaves like me? He behaves exactly like when you are nervous. Happy, when you want sex. Really? Behave. No. And he can take even hotter taste. Hot like fire. He's great. That could be coincidence. But something must be of genetic. What? Remember Kit could not talk before 3. Right, I worried I thought he was dumb. And the first thing he said was "Dad". Oh! You still like this for years? Yes, I always for this. The first time he called you "Dad". Quiet. You were very mad. Since then when he calls you Daddy. You'll lose control of your body. Right, so he calls me father. He is the same. So magical? What is his name? Chi Man Ching! Chi Man... He is back. Hide yourself. He likes rotten beancurd. He can really talk hot stuff. He wants to sexually assault beancurd? Who? No one. Oh! You dare not to see your son? Son, your Dad. He's your... - Father! - Father! Father... Father! - Father... - Father...

Don't jump yet. Is he my younger brother? Of course he is. But it's the first time you see him, I feel strange. What so strange, Dad is not rich. If so he may be interested in our money. No proof! If... What? The old way to test blood. Blood testing? Not, it will hurt him. You don't have to tell him. We cut his finger accidentally. And mix your blood with his If they mix, then it proves. What is the identity. Dad, give a hand. My son! What? Your eyebrow has gold colour. - Really? - Yes, it mean longevity. How does it mean? It means you have to get rid of the colour. Yeah.

Good, why do you do it? People pay me for doing it. I have to help. It's a pity, they treat you so well. They think that you are the younger son. You are beast. You can treat me like animal. I'll never touch them again. That's all I can do. Think how good they have been to you. They lost their job because of you. What do you intend to do? Deal with Macky and explain to them. Not possible. Why? The 6(9) rule of tricks is. Have to be tough and no regret. How foolish? Me! You can change it. But I had sworn, If ever I break any of the rules, I would be severely punished. What punishment? I can never date girls anymore. You can date me. What? You? Yes, me. What if you regret? I swear if you can't date girls anymore, and I don't go with you, I can never go out with the boys. Good. - Deal. - Deal. But one more condition. What condition? Can you have plastic surgery?

We are father & son, talk openly. I am not your son. What? I lied to you. I didn't tell you the truth. - Doesn't matter. - You understand? I understand. I know you need dad's love. But dad won't blame you. Dad loves both girls & boys, my daughter. I am not a girl, I don't mean this. What do you mean then? I...look over there. Nothing. You...you look so handsome.

Why do you hit my boy friend? You hit my boy friend. Are you alright? I am fine. Jing Koo regrets. He didn't expect to be treated so good. He won't help Macky. Really? I really hope Kit will forgive me. I will help you to deal with Macky. But Kit's neck has put on the "magic oil". It is so stiff. He believes you are his younger brother. He'll lose control if you fool him. "Magic oil" for the neck? Of course. Where else? Think of a way. Dad, the thunder is coming. What a world, I can't find my brother. Jing was here. He was here? He told dad a secret. What secret? This is the whole story. I was treated like a fool. No, there is always a reason. Forgive him. I won't forgive him. Kit, if he sincerely apologizes. Give him a chance. Fine, if he comes when I count 3 I forgive him. 1,2... You forgive me, how nice. - Thanks. - Yes... Dad, you have been helping him. No. Dad thought...Kit. - Don't call me. - Kit...Kit... Kit...he's sincere. How can I tell if he's sincere. If I fool you again, I'll get struck by thunder. You see. Kit, he's sincere. He's struck by thunder, don't help him. No, it was by mistake. Be careful. If I am going to fool you this time. I'll be struck to death by continue thunder. Oh! Jing, Don't make such bad oaths. Strike you devil. Are you alright? No reason. Must have mistaken me. I shouldn't have been struck. How come struck at the door way. I have no time. Hay! See. Don't have to say. I forget about the past. From this moment, I don't want to see you. Leave, please leave. Kit, don't! Fine, he stays and I leave. I found someone I can trust. - Kit. - Lucy, don't lean on the car.
