RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Two snowflakes. One Christmas tree. And... Three Santa hats. Are you ready, Aunt Molly? Not quite, Zoe. This is all she's been talking about all day... Wanting to get a Christmas tree with you for the bakery. I'm just running a little behind on my orders. Are all these all phone orders? Yep, and I still have to fill all these. There's gotta be a better system. Just 'cause you don't understand it... Ha! You got that right. It's simple. The green ones are sugar cookies, lime-green is gingerbread, the red ones are oatmeal ornament balls, and the white ones are bread orders for local restaurants. And if someone wants sugar cookies and gingerbread? Well, that... is what a stapler is for. I think someone should get Aunt Molly a computer for Christmas. I think that's a great idea. Nice job. Now he looks like Rudolph. Well, I'd say we're ready for the final touch. Want to do the honors? Really? Yeah. First Christmas in a new house... calls for a new tradition. Yeah. Looks pretty good. It's perfect. Hello, neighbors. - Hi, Aunt Amy. - Hey. I have lived in this neighborhood my whole life and this is, by far, the best job anyone has ever done decorating this house. Thanks. My dad helped. Well... cross it off the list. What list would that be? We created a list of things to do to make this the best Christmas ever. What a good idea. Look at you, bro. Embracing small-town Christmas. And to think that this time last year, you were in Arlington, writing software patches 24 hours a day. Charlie... remind me. Was "snowball fight" on the list? Oh, yeah. I thought so. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ambush! No fair! Two on one! Okay, Jimmy. I got your back. I've never seen you this busy. All thanks to a glowing article someone wrote about me in their magazine. It was all true, and you can thank my editor for putting you on the cover. Right! I should send her a box of cookies. It's been hectic, but I am so grateful for the business. I'm getting so many Christmas orders that I may be able to hire help soon. Please let it be someone with a better order-taking system. My system works just fine, thank you very much. Although, being able to take orders online through my website would be great. I will add that to my "to do in all that spare time I don't have" list. Mols... you've worked so hard to get here. I think it's great, but... But you're worried that I'm gonna get buried in all my work and miss out on all the wonderful things that life has to offer? No! Okay, yes. I'm just saying, you're young and I don't want you to be too busy for anything, or anyone, else. Are you guys ready yet? You know what, maybe the two of you should just... No way. This is your and Zoe's annual tradition, and we won't break it now. So how about Zoe and I pitch in, help you with these orders? That way, you get a good tree before they're all taken? Yeah! Yes, I will take you up on that offer. - Thank you. Okay! - Yes! I don't know what hurts more... My elbow from throwing snowballs, or my pride, after being pelted from my seven-year-old nephew. But nothing a little cocoa won't fix. We have a surprise for you. One for you... Thank you. And one for Charlie. Really? But it's not Christmas yet. Just open them. Both of you. These are something. We're throwing a crazy-Christmas-sweater- slash-welcome-Josh-and Charlie- to-town party. Tomorrow. You guys have been here for a few months now, it's time you met some of the locals. I have a lot of friends that are excited to meet you. It'll be great! Right, Charlie? Yeah. And I can add that to our list. And not to give anything away, but mine might light up. You want any help with the party? I was gonna bake Christmas cookies for the kids to decorate, but I'm so busy with this tree-lighting festival. Say no more. I will bake the cookies. How many do you want? Two dozen? Three? Are you sure you know how to bake cookies? Do I "know how to bake cookies"? Tell 'em, Charlie. I mean, I've never seen you make cookies. I know how to bake cookies. This kid's gonna help me. Okay. I'm putting "baking Christmas cookies" on the list, too. Thank you. That is a big help. This is my first year being in charge of the annual tree-lighting festival, and I'm a little behind on some of the details. You want some help with that, too? Really? If you're serious, I just might take you up on that. Can I help, too? Absolutely. The more, the merrier. Okay, you're both hired. Now, I do have the ingredients for tomorrow night's cookies, so I'll go home and get them for you. All right. Me and this guy, we got a... We got a big errand to do. Top-of-the-list item, right, buddy? How about this one? I don't know. The spine looks kind of crooked. True. That one's awesome. If I put that one in the store, there won't be any room for any customers. Look at that one! Check the needles. Not very soft. Yeah, you're right. The search continues. Check out that one. All right, let's see what we got here. Sorry. I didn't see you there. I was just checking to see if the needles were soft. Actually, we just walked up ourselves. But... why soft needles? Just means the tree won't dry out, it's well-hydrated. Interesting. Yeah, and if the needles are too soft, they won't hold ornaments. You know your trees. And how does this one stack up? I'd say it's perfect. So, whose tree is it? Well, we could cut it in half. You want the top half or the bottom half? Or we could cut it long ways, that way, we each have a tree that can go flat against a wall. Great space-saver. What do you say, buddy? Should we give them the tree? I think we should take it. Yeah... or, in the spirit of Christmas, we could do the kind thing and give them the tree. I thought you were going to say something like that. So... okay, you guys can have the tree. Well, if you insist... That is so kind of you. Thank you. Hey there. I think the ladies are gonna take this one. Sorry. That one's sold. What I was gonna say is, "always check for a 'sold' sign before you check for soft needles." Good idea. Well, I hope you find your tree. You too. Happy hunting. Same to you. And we go the same way. The good trees are up here. You know what? We're gonna check back there. Don't forget to check for 'sold' signs. Hey! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Over here! The cookies smell good. Well, let's hope they taste as good as they smell. I think we got the best tree in the whole place. That's no question. Do you think those other people ended up with a good tree? Who, that lady and her daughter? I'm sure they did. Thought they were really nice. Did you? I did. Seems like there's a lot of nice people here. Yeah, I'm glad we moved... being close to Uncle Jimmy and Aunt Amy... and Grandma. Me too. Well, looks like we're done with ornament bin one. Don't forget this one, Dad. Your first picture with Santa. Looks like I'm hurting Santa's ears. Remind me to apologize when we go see him this year. It's all part of the job. I miss her. Yeah, me too, buddy. You know, your mom loved you more than anything. Yeah. Okay. Time for the cranberries. Cranberries are so yucky. Why do we even put them on Christmas trees? Why not... strawberries? Or cookies? Because if we strung cookies, you would eat them all before Christmas. Besides, cranberries are an old tradition. I guess it's what they had available back in the olden days. Like when you were my age? Sure. Right after I churned the butter, I would string the cranberries! Round and round! - Okay, okay, okay! - Whoa, careful! Can you reach? That's it. Best Christmas tree ever. Let's... Let's take a photo. Are Christmas cookies supposed to smell like that? Oh, no. Watch yourself. Not sure we can cross "Christmas cookie baking" off our list yet, Dad. Maybe you can scrape them, like you do when you burn the toast? I think they're past scraping. Three, two... ...one! That's so great. I think this might be one of the prettiest ones you've ever had. Mama, feel the needles. Wait a minute. What am I feeling for? Aunt Molly's friend said they're supposed to be nice and soft. - Zoe... - Yes? You did such a good job on the tree this year that you get to pick any cookie in the store that you want. "Any"? As long as it's okay with your mom. Just one. Yes! So who's the friend you saw? He wasn't a friend. Just a fellow tree shopper being helpful. And did this helpful tree guy happen to be cute? I didn't really notice. Why? Because you're blushing. Because it's hot in here... ...from the ovens. Molly? Do you have any undecorated sugar cookies? Sure. Why? My Amy, my friend, she asked me if I could bring her over some. She's having a bit of a cookie emergency. Take as many as you want. All right. Got it. Looks great. You having fun? Best crazy Christmas sweater party ever. That's a tongue-twister! Look. I decorated this one to look just like our tree. I love it. Gotta go! Hi, honey! Mom. You just might win. "Craziest Christmas sweater." What do you mean? I didn't know there was a theme. I got ya. The look on your face. Are you enjoying the party? Are you kidding me? This is amazing. If it wasn't for you, these kids would be decorating charcoal. Thank you for trying. Ah, come on. Hey! Josh. Come and meet someone. This is our friend... Jessica Morris. Hi, I'm Josh. Hi. Jessica's also helping out with the festival. She's getting together all the decorations for the town tree. Well, that sounds like a big job. Oh, it is, and we still have to sort and count all the lights. I've already roped Jimmy into that job and maybe Josh could help him? What? Sure. Yeah. Jimmy told me that you're a big tech entrepreneur? It's more like I have a big brother who exaggerates. He's being humble. Well, welcome to Colbyville. Thank you. It's nice to meet you. There's a bunch of us going caroling in a few days. You should join us. I'm not much of a singer. Everyone can sing! It'll be fun. I could get your number and text you the details. What's your number? The Crazy Christmas sweater thing was a good idea. I'm glad you had a good time. I liked your friends, too. Were there any friends that you, I don't know, liked better than others? Well, let's see, yeah. I thought that Mr. Blanshard had a really nice handshake. I know what you guys are doing. Sorry. We just thought you could use a little push. You're just such a great guy, with so much to offer. And since it's a new chapter in your life, maybe it's time to get out there again. Look, I appreciate that, but it's not just "a new chapter" in my life, it's Charlie's, too. When Christie didn't come back, the only thing I could do to stop thinking about her was to work. Hour after hour, I coded, night after night. And then, Charlie, he came to me one morning and he said, "Dad, I'm afraid of losing you, too." And that's when I knew I had to change, I had to sell the company and I had to move here... to do what's best for Charlie. So my dating life can wait. That little guy is so wise for his age. Look, I love you guys. And I really appreciate what you're doing, but you gotta stop with the awkward set-ups. Fine. Besides... you're gonna be way too busy with all of... this. What's this? This is everything I need help with for the festival. There are notes in each file, but, mostly, it's just calling up all the vendors who've agreed to make a donation and arranging for pick-ups and deliveries. Be honest, is this too much to ask? It's my pleasure. Thank you so much. Gonna go find Charlie. That was a great party, Dad. Yeah. It was. I saw you playing with some kids your own age. Yeah, we had a lot of fun. Well, good. You get some sleep now so we can be fresh tomorrow for... "...Operation: Best Christmas Ever." Aw, this guy's seen a lot of love. Me and your mom got him for you before she went away. Do you think he ever gets lonely? Well, he's got you. He's got me, he's got Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Amy, Grandma. Well, that's his family, but he has no friends here. Maybe we should get him a friend. Really? Yeah, everybody needs a friend, why not every bear? Under the covers. Goodnight. Goodnight, Daddy. "Thank you for your offer to donate cookies. I am checking in on behalf of my sister-in-law, Amy Harling, to arrange pick-up or delivery." "I can deliver them. And Merry Christmas back atcha." "We'll start setting up around 10. Any time after that." "I still have a few more cookie questions." "If it's not too late, I can probably answer your questions better on the phone. Can I call you? "Sure." Hello? Sweet Life Bakery. Molly speaking. Hi! This is Josh, from the tree-lighting festival. Thanks for getting back to me so quick. I can't even believe you're up this late. Well, if I'm not baking in the middle of the night, there are no croissants for breakfast. Never thought of that. That's okay, I didn't know the middle of the night was when most festival organizing happens. Good point. I'm used to being up late from my last job. Security guard? Computer programmer. Writing code and exciting stuff like that. Well, it's nice to meet a fellow night owl. Well, I'm ready to answer your cookie questions, so long as none of them have to do with how to bake them, because my last attempt did not go so well. Well, if you play your cards right... I might share some of my secret cookie tips with you. My son would love that. How old is he? Seven. That's such a great age. I don't have kids myself, but my niece is 10. Yeah, he's a... he's a great kid. He and I just moved here a few months ago, and I really want this Christmas to be special for him, so any cookie baking tips would be greatly appreciated. Speaking of which... do you know what type of cookies you want and how many? That is a good question, to which I do not have an answer. Same as last year, maybe? That, I also don't know. Okay, where at the festival will you be handing them out? You know, I just went to a cookie-decorating party and it was a huge hit with the kids. So, what about a booth where they could do that kinda thing? That sounds fun. I could mix in some of my new oatmeal ornament balls with the traditional cut-out sugar cookies, and provide the frosting and sprinkles? You know what? I better check in with my sister-in-law about this. Would you mind if I got back to you? No, not at all. I will be here. Unless everyone goes gluten-free and stops eating bread. Okay. Well, until then. Sounds good. Bye. Would you mind moving that a bit closer to the corner? Thank you. Perfect. Are you sure it's not too cold for ice cream? It's never too cold for ice cream. Which reminds me... Why do ice-cream cones make great reporters? Please, no jokes. There's people around. Because they always get the scoop. Oh, come on, that's a good one. No more jokes, okay? All right. No more "dad" jokes. I guess I'll get the chocolate. You can't just get plain old chocolate, Dad. Look at the special Christmas flavors. When you're right, you're right. 'Tis the season. Gingerbread cookie, rum raisin, candy cane... Who wants raisins in their ice cream? What do you mean? Maybe I want raisins in my ice cream. No, then we can't share bites. Come on. I can't decide between gingerbread or candy cane. I really like gingerbread. But candy canes are really good, too. It's a tough call. Happy holidays. Ready to order? No. I think we need a minute. Hey! We know you. Yeah. The Christmas-tree stand. Looks like we're on the same Christmas activity schedule. It sure looks that way. My niece and I are on the hunt for the perfect gift for her parents. Aw, cute bear. Thanks. My other bear needed a friend. He was kinda lonely. Did you make your Christmas wish yet? Not yet. I'm still not sure what to wish for. Could it be for anything in the world? Yeah. Think so. Definitely! Go ahead of us. We're not ready. - Are you sure? Thank you. - Yeah. Of course. Zoe, you're up. I'll tell you what. I'll forgo the raisins, just for you. You get the candy cane, I'll get the gingerbread cookie, and we'll share bites. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Thank you. - Bye! - Bye. Maybe we'll see you at the next Christmas activity. I sure hope so. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. This is so good, Aunt Molly! So, I'm thinking a little too much vanilla? Oh, no way, it's perfect. If it came alive, I'd have to marry it. Hey! I might have something to say about that. But I definitely vote that this should go on the menu. In fact, I'm going in for a second piece. Can I have another piece, too, please? You may not. A little birdie told me you've already had a double scoop of ice cream today. Aunt Molly's not a little birdie. She's more like a stool pigeon. Hey. Watch it, or the torte disappears. Well... if I can't have another, may I be excused? You may. So... anything interesting happen today? Nope. Really? I don't know what you're talking about. Zoe told us you ran into some guy from the Christmas-tree stand. - Harold! - What? So much for the pinky swear of silence. Still, seems really like a lovely coincidence. Yes, it was just a coincidence, and that's all it was. He seems like a really nice man and a great dad. You can tell his son just loves him. Maybe you should have invited this great dad to dinner. I'm sure there's a really great mom at home. Who is it? I don't know. Business, probably. Hey! I can't believe she... I think you've had enough. Hello? Sweet Life Bakery. Hi there. It's Josh. Uh, "fellow night-owl Josh"? Hey. I didn't recognize your number. I'm calling to tell you I got the go-ahead to do the cookie-decorating station. Great! It's such a good idea. I know the kids are just gonna love it. But I gotta admit, that's not the only reason I'm calling. I have ulterior motives. Intriguing. My son and I are... we're still trying to cross "cookie baking" off our Christmas list. And as I mentioned before, my last batch was not a success. How much "not a success"? We set off the smoke alarm. Oh, no. Maybe there's something wrong with your oven? It works when I bake lasagna. Lasagna? You're a... jack of all trades. Except baking cookies, apparently. Well, what did the recipe say? 350 for nine minutes. And how long did you chill the dough? You did chill your dough, right? I was in a little bit of a hurry. That's probably the culprit. If they're warm and soft when you bake them, they'll just spread and burn because they're thinner. Always ask a pro. Well, good luck and let me know how it goes. Well, if you hear the fire engines, you'll know it's me. Goodbye. "I shouldn't have shared my secret tips. You could put me out of a job." I'll grab one more, to be safe. Yeah. Josh is gonna be there? You know, I wish I had labeled everything perfectly from last year, but things tend to get a little jumbled. With this being my first year as the one in charge, I just, I don't want anything to slip through the cracks. You're doing a great job. Are you kidding me? We got this. Where are these lights? Well, there are these lights here. Well, that's not bad. And all of these ones, over here. That's a lot of lights. And then there's these new lights that also need to be checked. Okay, so we should have this done by... next Christmas. We are really appreciative of the help. It's a really big tree. And Jessica got the Christmas store to donate all the ornaments for it. If you want to help us out with that, too, we could use a few extra hands. I can't. My hands are tied up. Well, check your schedule and give me a call. All right. Okay. Thanks, honey. Decorating a Christmas tree with a beautiful woman... What a horrible thing. Is this what we're gonna talk about for all 20,000 light bulbs? Fine. I'll drop it. Thank you. Bulb me. It's just nice having you nearby, okay? I'm sure it is... Free labor and all. I know this is a hard time of year for you and Charlie. I was worried about you for a few years in Arlington. Yeah, and now you can worry from next door. Not worried, exactly... it's just that something has me a little concerned. What are you concerned about? I got up last night to get a drink of water and I went to the kitchen window to see if it was snowing, and... and your lights were on and it looked like you were talking to yourself. In the middle of the night. I was. I was on the phone. I was placing a cookie order for the Christmas Festival with the lady from the bakery. You were talking to the bakery lady in the middle of the night? Well, yeah. If she's not baking in the middle of the night, there are no croissants for breakfast. Right. I never thought of that. But what were you doing up? Are you having trouble sleeping? Jimmy, you're my brother, not my mother. If we're gonna live next door to each other, we got to have some boundaries. Right. Boundaries. Or... I need thicker curtains. Plug it in. Hey, guys. Hi, Dad. Grandma's going to the community center later to wrap Christmas presents for soldiers. It's organized by the U.S.O. Operation... ..."Holidays for Heroes!" Can I go too? You said when Mom was a nurse in the Army, she couldn't come home for Christmas, and that made her really sad. I thought this might be a nice way to honor Christie's memory. I love that, Mom. She'd love that, too. And remember number nine on our "Best Christmas Ever" list? Yeah, isn't that... "build a snow fort"? No, silly! That's eight. Oh, right. Nine is "an act of Christmas kindness." One of my favorites. So, can I go? You can go, on one condition... That you do an act of Christmas kindness for me and you help to get all those bulbs into those lights. Deal? Deal. Are all these presents for the soldiers? Yeah, we want to make sure that they know we're thinking about them at Christmas. And once they're all wrapped, we just pack them up and we will send them overseas. I think I'm better at opening presents than wrapping them. Let me show you. You'll be a pro in no time. Now... you just put some tape there, yeah, and... ...you got it. Hey. It actually looks pretty good. Pretty good? It's perfect. You know, why don't you take these the wrapped gifts, put them on that cart, and wheel them over to that lady there, with the Santa tablecloth. Okay. One more. That's perfect. Good work. Did you wrap all of these? My grandma did most of them... but I helped! I have an awesome idea for you. Let me see if you go for this. Hey. I know the lady in that booth. That's Molly. She's helping people make special holiday message videos for the soldiers. Molly thought that, by hearing how much people back home appreciated their service, it would make opening the presents that much more special. It's called "Ho, Ho, Ho, from the Homefront." She seems like a really nice lady. The nicest! Always thinking about other people. It makes people happy just to be around her. Yeah. It does. Hey, can I make a video, too? Well, we're just wrapping up for today, but we're here all week. You just need to come back with your mom or dad. Okay. Cheese. I'll come back with my dad. Maybe he'll want to make a video, too. You did great. The lumber for the booths will arrive on schedule. I called Uncle Moe's Hardware and asked him if he would donate the supplies. That's a great idea. He wasn't even on my list. What did he say? Yes, and he'd deliver it himself. But I get to help build it! Of course! I'm counting on you. We can use the money we save on more lights and mistletoe for the mistletoe garden. How are we going to decorate the cookie booth? Well, what if we make it just a big old gingerbread house? Yeah! And then could we decorate gingerbread houses instead? Can we do that? All right, before we get ahead of ourselves, let me get in touch with the bakery. Good idea. Good idea! One sec. Hi! I... love gingerbread. Well, that's good, 'cause Charlie had an idea to turn the booth into a big old gingerbread house. That's a great idea. If I could live in a gingerbread house, trust me, I would. Well, you could just bake your own house, couldn't you? Gingerbread does get baked, right? Of course gingerbread gets baked. How else would you make it? And, not to brag, but my gingerbread is kind of out of this world. Well, I'm glad to hear that, and don't kill me... but once we came up with the booth, Charlie had an idea what if, instead of a cookie-decorating station, we just let the kids make gingerbread houses? That's a big change. I can make a bunch of squares and rectangles and triangles... And mix a big batch of frosting. I don't want to make a bunch of extra work for you. Are you kidding? That's fun for me. Well, we're gonna need a volunteer to help the kids with it, and I don't know much about gingerbread-house construction. I can help out. Really? That'd be perfect. I was saying I wanted to get more involved this year anyway, so... I was planning on closing the bakery and heading down to the festival. All right. It's a date. Great! Okay... - Dad? - Yeah? We're up. Look, I gotta run. I'll call you tonight? - Yeah, go. - Okay. Gingerbread houses it is. So? Do you know what you're gonna ask Santa to bring you yet? I'm still narrowing it down. All right, well, you better hurry up, because we are up in... Ready? Big smile. I'd say "Deck The Halls." How come? Because even if you don't know the words, you can still sing along with all the... I like the 12 Days of Christmas. Is that because you'd like 12 days of Christmas presents? Yes. But not if it's all swans and geese and hens and stuff. Ha! I counted, and there are 23 birds, including the partridge. That's a lot of birds. Your turn. Okay. I got one. What's your favorite Christmas tradition? Does it have to be one we've already done, or...? Well, I mean, that's kind of what traditions are, but... I guess not. Then I would say, "Ho, Ho, Ho from the Homefront." Interesting. What's that? It's part of "Operation: Holidays for Heroes," where you can send in a special Christmas video message for soldiers who are away from their families at Christmas. That sounds like a really nice idea. I thought we could do it together. I'd love that. I really wish your mom could see you now. She'd be so proud of who you are. Do you still miss her a lot? Of course I do. But we're doing pretty good, aren't we? Just the two of us? I feel bad sometimes 'cause I can't remember her that well. Charlie. You were really little. But trust me, she loved you like crazy. And if you ever want to see her, you just look in the mirror. You got her eyes and her exact smile. I do? You do. Now let's get this thing finished. Go get that brace. On it, Dad. That one. There. Last one and the cookie orders are done. It's like having my own little, helpful elf. Hey, watch it. I'm taller than you, and I'm still your sis. That wasn't a reference to your size. Well, good. I was referring to your pointy ears. Hey! By the way. Guess who I ran into yet again yesterday? You didn't. Christmas-tree guy? Where? In line to see Santa. You must have promised Zoe something really good because she didn't mention it. She didn't see him. He didn't see me... but I saw him and his son. And? And his very lovely wife. I see. It's a good thing I didn't take you up on your advice and invite him for dinner. Well, I was just joking. Half-joking. You lit up when you talked about him. I did not... light up. You had a bit of a glow. There was no "glow." Hi. Hey, did I catch you at a bad time? No, not at all. Charlie's spending time with his grandma, so I decided to come out and get him a gift. The booth looks incredible so far. I can't wait to see it all decorated. Well, I'm going to Tout De Sweet Confections Thursday at 3:00. I was hoping you could give me a list of the things we'll need to decorate the gingerbread houses. Oh, fun. Let's see. We'll need gumdrops, obviously. Obviously. And maybe mini candy canes, chocolate buttons, cinnamon candies, and peppermints? Maybe red and green licorice? Perfect. That sounds like a good start, and I'm sure they'll have some suggestions there as well. Okay, well, I don't want to take up too much of your time. I'm sure you're busy. Not really. I'm just finishing up. But I don't want to keep you. Oh, no. You're not at all. I actually enjoy the company. So... what made you become a baker? Did you go to school for that? No. I studied finance. I wanted to be a banker. From banker to baker? What made you change your mind? Working in a bank. Come on, there's got to be more to it than that. Well, it's kind of a sad story. While I was working at the bank, I baked a wedding cake. What'd you do? Ruin someone's wedding? No, the groom did that. It was a big wedding, half the town was there. I baked this huge, three-tier wedding cake, and I was so nervous about it being perfect that I made three practice cakes beforehand. I even matched the dress on the top of the cake to the actual bride's dress. But, unlike the top of the cake, there was no groom at the altar. He just... well, he never gave me a clear explanation. He just had a change of heart. I'm sorry. On the bright side, everyone loved my wedding cake. It was so good that my boss at the bank offered me a small business loan if ever I decided I wanted to open up my own bakery. Or maybe she just felt bad that I was left at the altar. I didn't mean for you to have to tell me all that. That's okay. You're a good listener. I know what it's like to need to talk to somebody. Oh, gosh, I was rambling. My point was that I love my bakery and I wouldn't trade it for anything else. Exactly! It's not about what I don't have, it's about what I do have. Like my son, Charlie. That's so sweet. He's a lucky kid. And how long has it been just you and Charlie? Five years. Christie was... She was amazing. She was actually the reason I got up the nerve to start my own business. I met her while doing I.T. work at the V.A. hospital, where she was stationed as a nurse. My mom was a nurse. Yeah? Yeah, she worked long hours, but she always made time for us. It's such a selfless career. All Christie wanted to do was help people. Then she got deployed. She wasn't supposed to be anywhere near combat, but her convoy was targeted. It was just... bad luck. For a while, my mind was just spinning. It was like... being in the middle of a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. But then I just put my head down and I moved forward, for Charlie. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... No, no, no, look. I don't get to talk about this very often. And plus, like you said, it's nice to be able to talk about this with someone who listens, and isn't always just telling me to get back out there. I know. Everyone means well, I'm sure, but... it's not like there's a switch a person can flip. Yeah, people don't seem to understand that dating can be complicated. Exactly. And I have a business to run. I don't need complicated. Plus... Charlie's my everything. Way to go, buddy. You were winning. Charlie, come on over. Come here. Whoa! You're getting too fast, young man. I don't know how I'm gonna keep up with you anymore. Next time, I'll give you a head start. Well, how about we get some hot chocolate? - Sounds great. - Come on. Thankfully, I did not burn the cookies. Look at Zoe go. She's really improved. I know, can you believe it? She must get it from Harold's side. You and I were both hopeless. Speak for yourself. I was grace personified. I seem to recall you "gracefully" spending a lot of time on your behind. Ha. So... for Christmas dinner, can you bring the bread and rolls? Of course. And what about dessert? Harold has been begging for another one of those chocolate tortes. Actually... ...Better make it two? So, what's next? Well... we still have a snow fort to build. Plus, we haven't gone sledding. Don't forget about my idea to make the video message for the soldiers. There's still a few things I gotta do for the, Christmas-tree-lighting festival, which reminds me... Who's texting you? Is that "Gingerbread Man" again? Last time, you called him "the cookie guy." Can we at least be consistent? "Gumdrops... and candy canes." Let's do it. Good job today, honey. Thanks, Mom. Hey, who wants a snack? My treat. I do! You do? Well, what kind of ice cream flavor do you want this time? Cookie dough, please. Ooh, cookie dough is good. I'm gonna get bubble gum. There you go. Thank you. See you again. Merry Christmas! How are my favorite sisters? Mr. Blanshard! Good to see you again. Molly, all you ever do is work. You really have to come by the restaurant and try the bruschetta my wife makes with your bread. It is so good. What a great idea. Maybe you can invite a friend. The two of you have conversation over a nice dinner. And don't forget the wine and candlelight. I'll make it very romantic for you. Thank you, Mr. Blanshard. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. - Bye-bye. - Bye. See? Even Mr. Blanshard is totally onboard with you inviting Josh to a romantic dinner. I mean, are you just gonna keep talking on the phone? For now. It's complicated. He's a single dad. That's a wrinkle. He's totally devoted to raising his son, and I respect that. He basically said that he's not interested in dating anyone right now. That's fair enough. And that can change. Clearly, you like him. No. Maybe. Okay, just a little. When I talk to him, it's easy. There's something freeing about not being face to face that I can't describe. We tell each other things that we don't tell other people. I don't think that will change if you meet in person. And if there's no chemistry, well, you have a new friend. But if there is chemistry... Well, I mean, we'll see. I am gonna be meeting him at the tree-lighting festival. But aren't you curious to see what he looks like first? Actually, I... I know exactly where he's gonna be at 3:00. Hey. Great! - No, no! - Yes! Thank you so much for coming. Oh, hi. Right on time. You know, punctuality is a rare quality these days. Thank you. A hug. It's great to see you. It's too bad that you missed the Christmas caroling the other day. Yeah, I'm sorry. I've just been so busy with the festival. Thank you for your donation. I think the kids are gonna be so excited about the whole gingerbread booth and... Wait till you see what I pulled for you. Got some great stuff. This is a really bad idea. I should not have let you talk me into this. I can't get a good look at him. Maybe we should just head back to the bakery. What are you doing? Going inside, to get a better look. I don't want to meet him! I just want a quick peek. We can't even see him from here. Besides... he doesn't know what you look like, remember? Well, what if he recognizes my voice? Honestly? No. No. We can't take any chances. Just be patient. I'm sure he'll turn around. Fine. Oh, my gosh! What? It's him. Well, it must be, he's the only man in the store. No, no, no, no, no. It's "him" him. What? So wait. Josh who calls on the phone and the guy you keep running into are the same guy? Maybe it's just a coincidence? Text him. Yes. Okay. "Hey. Have you... made it to the candy store yet?" He's getting his phone out! That could totally still be a coincidence. These are so fun. Perfect for sprinkling around, you know? Just sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle. You can add as much color as you want. Sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle. It's not a coincidence. It is him. "Make sure you get the gumdrops." He's coming! Go, go, go, go, go, go! It doesn't make any sense. Josh is a single dad, but I saw that man at Santa's Village with his wife. Wait. There must be something that we're missing. Do you know Josh's last name? Heart... Hardwick... No. No, no, no. Harley. - "Harling"? - Yes! Harling. Is his sister-in-law in charge of the Christmas Festival? Yeah. Hold on. That's her! That's my friend, Amy Harling. It's Josh's sister-in-law. She's married to his brother, Jimmy. His sister-in-law? I think I need to sit down. This is so exciting! Exciting? Yes! You said you had a strong connection over the phone and chemistry in person. I did and I do. We do. You know what this means? That I'm gonna be sick? No. This means that I'm going to buy you the most beautiful dress for when you meet Josh at the Christmas Festival. Goodnight, buddy. When we wake up, it'll only be... three days till Christmas morning. We've done so many fun things this year. We're gonna do a lot more fun stuff, like the tree-lighting festival, Christmas dinner with Grandma and Aunt Amy and Uncle Jimmy. What's on the list for tomorrow? Well, we still have to record our video message for "Ho, Ho, Ho from the Homefront." I can't wait. Me neither. I'll see you when the clouds turn. I love you, Dad. I love you, too. Goodnight. Goodnight. Okay. Hi, Molly. Josh. I just called to let you know that the gingerbread is almost finished. Well, that's great. How was your day? My day was interesting. How so? You know, just had some interesting stuff. How was yours? Well, I went to the candy store, checked out the decorations. Right. That was today. You know, Tout De Sweet Confections is pretty close to my bakery. Really? Well, I wish I would've known. I would've stopped by. That would've been neat. Well, since we switched to gingerbread, do you want any help getting that to the festival? Oh, no. No, my van is plenty big enough to deliver it. Well, great. So... see you there? Yes. Yes, you will... ...see me. Bye. Okay, bye. Hello there. - Charlie Harling. - Hi. We're here to record our "Holidays for Heroes" video message. Just go on back there. Thanks. You keep turning up like a lucky penny. You're not the video lady. Well, I'm... I'm one of them. We have a few that volunteer. Are you here to make a video message? I'm sure you're busy. Maybe we could come back a different day. Yeah, but we're... We're here now. We've got lots of Santa hats and some elf costumes for your video, if you want to go check them out. Okay. Sorry. That's okay. He set this all up as a surprise. I'm not sure why he suddenly wants to do it another day. He's probably nervous. He seems like a sweet kid. Well, he is. And, his father seems pretty amazing, too. Well... I'm actually really glad that you're here. I wanted to thank you for helping me out with the lights. It's my pleasure. Well, to show my appreciation, I'd like to take you out for dinner. Dinner? Have you ever been to Blanshard's Junction? Not yet. It's the best. What do you say? I think that's really nice of you, but there's not a need. Please, I insist. Wait, now I'm having second thoughts about the dress. I'm telling you, it's perfect. So? What did you say? I was so shocked, I just rambled for a while, and then I told her I'd let her know. She probably thinks I'm a fool. I don't know. Maybe she likes funny and foolish. It's just dinner. You know what I just remembered? Charlie and I are supposed to finish decorating the gingerbread house today. Dinner's not until five hours away. You've got plenty of time. And plus, we were gonna cross "snowfort" off the list. I don't wanna push it. I think I'll just text her and politely decline. Anyways, it's not like she made reservations. Jessica. She made reservations. Come on, man. Allow yourself to have fun sometimes. It's not about me. It's about Charlie. I just don't think he's ready for that. I don't want him to think anything comes before him. Now, this... is what I call a snow fort. Pretty cool! "Pretty cool"? This thing could withstand snowballs shot from a cannon. Yeah, except I can't see over the walls. Yeah, good point. Well, I could be on the lookout for intruders. Maybe, but if you stand up, you might get pelted. Yeah. I guess I got a little carried away. I have an idea. My periscope. I love it! Because, then... we could see the enemy advancing from miles away. Well, it's a toy periscope, so maybe not "miles away". Yeah, right. Right. Okay. All right. So, where do I find one of these low-powered periscopes? Upstairs, in my closet. I'm on it. I hope my Dad can find someone that will make him happy again, like he was when my mom was alive. And if possible, could you please deliver this by Christmas? I got ya. Traitor. Sorry, couldn't resist. Well, here's your periscope. Thanks. Come on. Let's cross "snowfort" off the list. You go in, I'll be in in a minute. And if nailing your dad with snowballs is on the list, you cross that off, too. Okey-dokey. You're getting pretty good with that thing. It's fun. Maybe I'll be a carpenter when I grow up. Well, that's a good job. I mean... not if I become a fireman. Ha. Well, you got plenty of time to decide. Well... good job on the lights. Just one more thing. The sign? In the back of the car. The booth looks great. Yeah, she's gonna love it. - Who? - You know. Everybody. Okay. Well, I better get home and shower. Mom's coming over in a little while, to watch Charlie. That's right! Dinner at Blanshard's. Yeah. Any advice? Get the ribeye. You know what I mean. You're thinking too much. Charlie wants you to be happy. And so would Christie. You're right. So lighten up! Enjoy yourself. It's dinner. Just go with it. And I mean it... order the ribeye. Our families have had these stores next door to each other for generations. I practically grew up here. I've known Jess since she was a baby. Must be something, to grow up in a candy store. It had its advantages, but my parents used to make us do so many chores that it really did feel like work, not free candy. Well, listen, I just wanted to say hello and enjoy your dinner. Thank you. So what about you? Have you always want to be a computer programmer? No. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a professional hockey player, but it turns out, my math skills were stronger than my slapshot. Yeah. Hey, your store has a great website. Thanks. Now 75% of our sales is actually online. Yeah. Whose platform are you running? I have no idea. I usually stick to the marketing and I farm out the tech stuff. The "tech stuff"? Talking to a tech guy. I didn't... I didn't mean it that way. Do you have to answer that? No. Good. Hey, I just saw your text now. The finished booth looks incredible. I will probably be up for a while so give me a call when you get this. Bye. Oh, no. Oh, no, Mr. Blanshard's bread! Oh, no. No, no, no, no! Mr. Blanshard, I am so sorry. I was just about to call. It's not like you to be late. I know. My system failed me. In 30 years, I have never run out of bread, and we were this close. The restaurant's packed tonight. Yeah, I guess with Christmas coming, everybody wants to be dining out. Well, I am grateful for your business and this order is on me. Aw, it's a Christmas miracle. Listen, why don't you come in and let me cook something for you? I'd love to, but I can't. I still have a ton of gingerbread to finish baking for the festival. Something to go, then. Look, I absolutely insist. It'll take me five minutes. Okay, five minutes. Good. You know what? Maybe another time? How did it go, sweetie? Fine. How was Charlie? Fantastic. He reminds me so much of you at that age. We did lots of fun stuff. We even started the annual Christmas puzzle. I always knew it was Christmas when the puzzle would come out. We made a good start, but I held off. I knew that the two of you would want to finish it together. Thanks, Mom. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. Hey. What's the emergency? I need you to deliver all this stuff to the festival for me. Why? I thought you were gonna do it. Because I can't. What are you talking about? Last night, I saw Josh eating dinner at Blanshard's Junction when I delivered bread. Well, a man's got to eat. I still don't understand the problem. He wasn't alone. He was with Jessica Morris on a date. Are you sure? A couple of days ago, you thought his sister-in-law was his wife. There were candles and... wine and laughing... I know what a date looks like. Oh, Mols. I feel like such a fool. I made up this entire fantasy in my head. But he wasn't flirting with me. And he's not too busy with his son to date, either. He's just... interested in dating someone else. I'm sorry. Come here. It's okay. It's okay. There she is. I'm nervous. Why are you nervous? The festival's gonna go great. Thanks. You're great. Hi. Molly? It's me, Josh. Actually, I'm Jane, Molly's sister. I'm sorry, my mistake. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Is she coming? No, she can't. She's really busy with... muffins. Muffins? Yeah, crazy-big muffin order came in this morning. Okay. Well, would you tell her I said thanks? Yes, of course. Dad! Dad. Ready to get set up? Yeah! I'm gonna need somebody to taste the frosting, see if it's any good. Yes! Listen. Would you mind texting her and saying that if she does decide to come to the festival, I sure would like to put a face to a voice. I will. Thank you. So close. Yes! I'm glad you're always on my side in a snowball fight. Always, Dad. Thank you. "'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there." And of course he gets the first one. - Yeah! - Nice. Hi! Charlie and I are about to start in on the gingerbread houses. If your muffin emergency is over, we could use your expertise. Bye. What do you say, jellybeans for the roof? Yeah. Except that's one too many. And that's one more too many. Who's that guy? A soldier. Are you happy with how the video message turned out today? Not completely. Why? It was well-written and you presented it well on camera. Yeah, but I was hoping something else would happen. What's that? You promise you won't get angry? Of course. I'm happy that I made the video, but there was another reason why I wanted to go back there with you. Why? Because I thought we would see the lady who works there. Who? Jessica? No, the other one, the nice one that we saw when we were buying a Christmas tree and getting ice cream. She was the one that was running the video booth the day that I volunteered with Grandma. She is a nice lady, but why do you want to see her again? One of the other ladies who works there said that she makes everyone around her happy. And that's true, because you seemed really happy when you were talking to her. I am happy. Charlie, you make me happy. You understand that? Yeah, but like you said, everybody needs a friend. Look at that gingerbread house. Can I help? - Yeah. - Okay, Grandma. You can help me with the roof. Excellent. Okay... Why don't you sit here? - All right. - Hey, Josh! - Yeah. - Do you have a second? Yeah. Want to finish it up? I will. I'll be back in a minute. Goodie. Let's get at 'er. Why isn't Aunt Molly here? She... had something come up. But she made all of this gingerbread, and she bought a dress, and she loves Christmas! You're right. She should be here. Excuse me. Amy! Hey, Jane. Thank you so much. This is the best Christmas festival yet. Well, it wasn't just me. There are so many volunteers. I can't believe Molly baked all that gingerbread. That's heroic. Well, she had a whole lot of help in the planning. I think it's from your brother-in-law? - Yeah. - My brother, Josh. That's... That's him, over there. He really jumped in and took care of about a million details. Is he dating Jessica? No. We're trying to set them up. He humored us and went to dinner with her, but we're 0 and 1 in the matchmaking game. But, you know, at very least, he'll make a new friend. Right. You know, I do think he's interested in someone. He spends a lot of time talking to somebody on the phone. Interesting. Molly! Jane? No time to explain. What are you doing here? Just put the dress on and come with me. Why? I'm so excited! Me too. Okay, who's ready for the big event? I love you, Dad. I love you, son. But before we light the tree... A Christmas wish, for everyone here tonight, everyone in Colbyville... and everyone in the world... May this season of gift-giving include the gift of an open heart... ...an open heart that lasts not just for a day, or Christmas week... but that lasts for a lifetime. Okay. Here we go. Ten... Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. - Hi. - Five... - Hi. - Four... three... two... one! Merry Christmas! You probably remember me from... The tree stand. And the ice-cream store. Yeah. But there's something else that you should probably know. Merry Christmas. I can't believe it's been you the whole time. Surprised? From the moment I met you, I knew... There was something about you. All those talks on the phone... I felt like I knew you. I couldn't wait to meet you. I wasn't sure that you wanted to. That's 'cause I wasn't brave enough to tell you that I did. We both said "Dating is complicated." This doesn't seem too complicated. No. It doesn't. The simplest thing in the world. Hi. My name is Charlie. Hello, Charlie. We've heard so much about you. Pleasure to meet you. Hi. My name's Charlie, and I know what it's like to not be with someone you love at Christmastime, so thank you for the sacrifice you're making, so that the rest of us back home can have the best Christmas ever.
