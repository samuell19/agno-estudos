Subtitles by DramaFever - Thank you. - Goodbye! - Mom, I want to go home. - Don't you dare move an inch. Don't you say another word or you'll starve! I have to go back up to Seoul. - I'm worried that-- - Why are you worried about them?! Open up... oh Prince. Get out. - Write a 'Closed' sign here for me. - Yes sir. - And you'll get hit and many times you knock. - Yes sir! - We got it, sir. - Ow! Episode 15 You have to act within the angle shot so the camera can capture you. So it's important that you know where the camera is. Kim Ha Jin? You've been in front of the cameras before so you must have some experience to share. Would you like to try it out in front of the class? Here. We have a rock star today, right? The scene is about a long-time friendship between a manager and his client. You punk, did you set up shop there? When are you coming? I'm going. It's just that I'm imprisoned here. Don't you trust me? I'll do my best to make it. But is Ji Hyuk okay? I don't know if he's dead or alive. Come back soon. - Why don't you go look for him? - I already did! He won't even open the door so I don't know if he's home. - Just get your butt over here. - I'm going! My mom's coming over so I have to hang up. Why'd you call me over here? What's wrong? The ballad I wrote - shouldn't you be singing it like the world's crumbling down? We're recording it again. What's the matter with you? Are you shaken up about Eye Candy? I don't want to talk to you unless I have to, so don't pretend like you know what's going on. Why? You probably won't find anyone who will hear you out like I can right now. You and I... we're both traitors. Don't go around acting like you know it all. Even if you don't know what I'm thinking, it's the same conclusion. Neither you nor I have anybody at our sides. The fact that you're still unhappy... even though you got everything you wanted. [Kwon Ji Hyuk] [Lee Hyun Soo] [Kim Ha Jin] Lee Hyun Soo, take a look at this. What's this? The revised version from yesterday's recording session. Are you taking care of your voice? I'll take care of myself, so go about your business. If I don't want to see his face anymore, I'll have to transfer schools. Do we have to keep going to school with that bastard? And why's Kyung Jong not coming? I heard Eye Candy broke up. Get lost before I punch your face. It's too bad we didn't see the dolphins' show. So why didn't you guys beg to Seung Hoon? Like Lee Hyun Soo did? - What? - Is there anything else he's got except looks? It's because of Seung Hoon that he's a star. So you guys should have kept to the rules. Didn't you know that Kwon Ji Hyuk would only bring you down? You idiots... Is that why you guys got dumped by Seung Hoon? - What is this punk saying? - He's not wrong. We did get dumped. - Let's talk. - I've got nothing to say to you. If you've got something to say, you can say it here. There's something I need to ask you, so follow me. Why? You can't ask it here? Ah... you're trying to maintain your image because you're a star? - Are you going to be this way? - This kid just won't stop, will he? - Abandoning your friends... - I heard you guys gave up on Eye Candy too. Not that someone spoke for you, but that you voluntarily chose to broke up. So why are you taking it out on me? Do you think you have the right to? - Who are you to talk about rights...?! - Stop it. - You're the same too, you bastard! - I'm going to go crazy. Who are you shouting out? Are you blind because you're a star now? Let's not do this to each other. Stop it. Let go. Follow me. Let's not do this to each other. Stop it. Let go. Follow me. [Joo Byung Hee] What's up with your expression? Are you angry? You're angry because I like Su Ah, right? So that's why you won't appear in my dreams... I burned my guitar. Now Eye Candy's gone. And I'm going to stop playing music. But I couldn't burn your guitar. Because I was afraid you'd get mad. Would things have been different... if you were still alive? Why did you leave me behind? You bastard. Hey, hey. Stop it. Let go, you punk! Let me go! Where's Kwon Ji Hyuk! He should see for himself what road his leadership led us on. The person who's hurting the most is Ji Hyuk. Bullshit. What kind of team leader did nothing while his band broke up?! What are you talking about? Who's the one who betrayed us?! If you want to know, ask Kwon Ji Hyuk yourself. - Where do you think you're going, you punk! - Hey, that's enough. Stop it. About Hyun Soo... ...Ji Hyuk's the one who let him go. What? Hey, if you're not coming up soon, just stay there. Just wait a little longer. I said I'm coming. Hyun Soo punched me, you punk. Why'd you lose your temper? Fighting with him again... I heard that Ji Hyuk's the one... who let Hyun Soo go. What did you say? He didn't betray us, but Ji Hyuk made him leave. Those kids trying to act all cool by themselves. - I made a fool out of myself! - A fool? What are you talking about? Never mind, never mind. Looks like I have to come up myself. - Really? - Yeah. Just wait a little longer. I got it. Mom, I've got something to say. What is it? [Eye Candy: the shining band who left us with just two singles] Well... I also think it's a shame too. Thank you for your concern, but their comeback is still undetermined. Excuse me? But isn't that a bit harsh of you to say that? What do you mean that the band disbanded in order to save Lee Hyun Soo? Let Hyun Soo have a contract. It's not like the band's disbanding... do you think Hyun Soo will consider it? I'll make him. You're here? What were you doing? Are you going to keep making things hard on yourself? Is it hard? Compared to what Ji Hyuk's going through, it's just nothing... He loved playing with his friends in their band... I feel like everything's messed up because of me. That's their problem. I think about it... every day. If I didn't move into that rooftop room... ...if I didn't like Ji Hyuk, if I didn't move into Ji Hyuk's place, So why didn't you stay by his side? Because if I did, it would make things harder for him. Because breaking up with him was the one thing that I could do. Sorry. You might be right that it's hard. Even though I know it's tough for you to hear this too. And you listen to every word. Hear me out... just this once. Why is a tall kid like you walking around with his head hung so low? Hey, you punk! What happened? What about your mom? I asked my mom if she can't trust her own son, and told her directly like a man. Hey, you punk. You're pretty cool! - You punk. - Let me go. I had to take care of the place by myself! You know how many times I called you? Kwon Ji Hyuk. Where were you? You wouldn't take our calls. Just... here and there. - Are you well? - You traveled a long ways. What were you doing without thinking about us? What. Come out with it. We heard about what went on with Hyun Soo. - So what? - We didn't know anything... - Would it have changed anything? - That's not the point. If we'd known... If this was going on, he should have told us so we could discuss it together. Well that butthole... It looks like Hyun Soo has a huge misconception towards you... So you're worried about Hyun Soo now? When was it that you were cursing him.. That's when I didn't know! Oh Hyun Soo...His face is messed up. What will he do when he goes on TV? Let's call Hyun Soo over and tell him that we know everything. Forget it. Later. Let's tell him when Hyun Soo's solo album is a success. Why? Because he might quit and say that he's going to join the band again. Though there's no band to come back to. Hey, let's go eat some ramyun. I'd like to, but I've got a curfew now. My mom threatened to come back up if I don't pick up by 10. She's got you trapped. Let's just go by ourselves. I'm sorry too. For now I can only go to and from school and the pool hall. I have to go home too today. Fine. That's fine. Let's eat together another time. I'm off. I wanted to tell you just once The love I cannot contain The time I've spent looking your way I want to tell you everything Today I want you Today I want to hold you in my arms Looking at you Looking at you - Are you done with work? - I am. - Let's put aside our positions and chat. - Excuse me? Follow me. I thought you wanted to talk. What are we doing here? - Hey! You -- stop complaining. - What? - 'Hey!'? 'You!'? - Yeah. Why? I told you already that we'd talk one on one without consideration of our positions. I keep calling you Director, even though you're younger than me. Can you hold your liquor? One shot, huh? I'm...really...upset. I, Yoo Hae Ri who's maintained my cold and charismatic image. Do you know how lenient I was with the Eye Candy guys? Why? Why, why'd you do it? At first... it was just curiosity. I liked their confidence...their bravado... Yeah that. And also that bit of crazy that even Midas hands can't make. That's what their music was like... It's the first time I've seen that in 15 years since I saw you and Rock Kim at a club in Itaewon. You were there that time? You were a total fan. It's the first time in my career that my conscience has nagged at me. I thought I was doing my best, But in order to save Lee Hyun Soo, did I wrong Kwon Ji Hyuk? Did I break their tear-inducing friendship? What? What? What did you say to Kwon Ji Hyuk? - One more bottle ov--over here. - Yes. Oh, good good. Keep drinking. Drink it all. Tell me. Please bring it quickly! This place sure hasn't changed. It's been a year but you should still say hello to your mother. Did you come just to hear me say hello to you? You've gotten mature since I've seen you last. Speaking formally to your elders. Let me see your face-- Don't do that. Right. That's my son. What is it this time? Is your lawyer too busy that you came to find me yourself? Did he say that I sent him? So you gave up your inheritance? Tell them to give it the dogs. You're also legally your father's son. No matter what your brothers say. Did I say that I ever wanted to be a part of that family? Every time your band was in a scandal, your brothers guilted me about it. So what? You came to talk about that? Stop living here. Nothing good will come out of you staying. If you want to continue studying music, we'll send you abroad. Why? Those bastards want to drive me out now? It'll be tiring for you and me if you stay here! Things aren't good for you either. - I'll handle everything when you leave... - You can tell them I've got no ties to them. Don't be stupid, why would you give up your fair share? My share? My share?! You don't want anything to do with me so how can that be my share? That's okay. You're still young so you don't understand... - I'm not asking you to understand. - Then forget it. But you're still my son. Well that's too bad. I don't have a mother. I don't need any of that, but let me ask one thing. Why did you ditch me? You've never mentioned it before, so why are you asking now.. Because I can't keep acting like it's fine. I'm sick and tired of hating you so tell me. Keep hating me and live off of that strength. If you don't tell me now, you won't see me and I won't ask anymore. So answer me. - Answer me! - Because... Because I didn't want to pass on my poverty to you. You may have become rich, but I'm still poor, you know! Out of...out of a mother's greed, thought it was better to drag you with me. Even though I was young... no matter how young I was... No matter how hard it was... You should have asked if I wanted a mother around. If I did, then you'd hate me now for a different reason. - I don't regret it. - Look, Mother... Don't think that you were protecting me. I'm not thankful in the least. Ji Hyuk. Keep singing. My son’s voice sounded really great. Too bad. You won't hear it anymore. You didn't come to school? - Are you sick? - No. - Then? - Just because. - Okay. I'll visit after school. - No, Seung Hoon. Don't come. - I want to be alone. - Okay. Call you later. - Do you have something to say to me? - What? What if I do? - Say it. - How's that punk Hyun Soo doing? - Why are you asking me? - He's been out of school for a week. If he's okay, then forget it. I'm warning you on behalf of Eye Candy, if you do the same thing to Hyun Soo as you did to us, you're dead meat. He knows. No, there's no need for you to sit. This is your pay, including today's. Thank you for your hard work. I called you in to say goodbye properly. - Well, there's still Hyun Soo.. - Hyun Soo's been assigned to a new manager. We were talking about the boys' welfare last night so what's with this... What we spoke about last night was out of bounds. You remember that you signed a nondisclosure clause in your contract? Rather than just letting it pass, I hope that we can forget about it legally. Does the fact that you were my fan also fall under that clause? You could say that. I thought you were human last night, but you're like a different person now. Fine. - Oh, Hyun Soo. - Hello. Your duet with Ye Rim seems to be a hit. How's the preparation for your single album? Keep in touch. You have to make it big. Even if Eye Candy didn't make it. After what Ji Hyuk did for you.. But in order to save Lee Hyun Soo, did I wrong Kwon Ji Hyuk? Never mind, never mind. Hyun Soo, fighting! You have to make it big. After what Ji Hyuk did for you... They said it's next week. - What is? - The last gig for our duet. - So what? - Let's have a party and invite Eye Candy. - Forget it. - Why? It's been a while since I've seen Ha Jin and Kyung Jong. Let's get together. Are you slow or just ignorant of other people? Do you want to mention his name even though you know what happened? Did it get bad? With you and your friends? Forget it. You're not interested in me lately. You tell me 'Get out,' 'Leave,' and 'Forget it,' all the time. - Do you know if Ha Jin likes you or not? - I think so...now that I think of it, yeah. You get it now? So that's why I'm not interested in you. - Hello. - Hyun Soo. It's been a while. - You're a total star now. - Hyun Soo! - I said we'd come to see you. - It's fine. Work is over. Don't bother your brother too much, okay? Let's go. Who is this? Isn't this Lee Hyun Soo? What is a shining star like you doing in a no name club like this? Your parents must be so proud. To have raised such a wonderful son. Yes, we are. Let's go. Wait wait. It's a shame for you to just leave. We're one family, after all. - A family! - Yes! Like how your father and mother are a part of our family. So Hyun Soo is a part of our family too. - Ah, yes. - Our customers don't seem to like oldies. Music is all about pop songs, pop songs these days, right? You know that duet you sang with Ye Rim? That was pretty good. Can you... sing that for us here? Ah, well... he can't schedule his own jobs apart from the company's approval. This isn't just a job. He can't do that for the people? - I'm sorry. - Hyun Soo, you can do that for us, right? - Yes. - Of course. I knew you would. What? You want to sing at a caberet club? It's not for the money, but it's for my parents-- It doesn't matter. Do you know how difficult it was for me to strip you of Eye Candy's tarnished image? It wasn't enough that you were in a failed band, you want to add that you sing a third-rate nightclubs too? Does standing on stage with my parents make me third-rate? You've seen what breaking up Eye Candy did to you. They can pick you apart for being someone's son. Are you doing this because you're afraid they'll find out I'm a caberet's son? I'm saying now is not a good time. I've never been embarrassed of my parents. You've only just begun. You still have to put out your solo album. I already promised them. I'll sing one song. Wake up! Do you know how much Kwon Ji Hyuk begged to make sure you got a contract? He said he'd do anything as long as you were signed. The one who boldly ripped up a contract in front of me, the one who told the reporters flat-out that he had a girlfriend, He said he'd do anything to make sure you got a contract. What are you saying right now? Should you come out like this after your friends sacrificed so much? Wait a second What are you talking about! Should you come out like this after your friends sacrificed so much? Wait a second What are you talking about! Hey...isn't Ji Hyuk a little strange? All he does is stare at the TV. Will something happen if he stays like that? He'll turn into just some pool hall mole. Hyun Soo. You came? - Who told you to do all that? - Do what? Did you think I'd cry in gratitude? Huh?! - Whe are you to meddle in my business? - It's good to hear that it's working out. That's right. I wanted to make it big on my own. But not like this! I don't know what you've heard, but it's the past so forget it. Yeah Hyun Soo. We heard everything from Ji Hyuk. We don't hold anything against you now. What did you do? Our band was breaking apart, so what did you do?! Well, what are you coming here now and saying I should do?! Was it a crime for me to like Su Ah? Huh? I wanted to see her, so I did. For a girl who had nowhere else to go, I told her to stay at a place that was already empty. - What does that have to do with the band? - I understand your feelings. - That's not wrong, but... - That I said I had a girlfriend to the reporters? I didn't want to hide anymore. But what about that? Did I ever say one word about you guys causing trouble? - Ji Hyuk, calm down. - You're the same too, you bastard. You pretend that you're so thoughtful, but whenever Su Ah's name came up... ..your face got so hard, you wouldn't let me say a word. You don't think I know that? Friends who are supposed to be with you, but you all ditched with one word from your folks! I'm left-I'm left behind on my own, so what am I supposed to do? It wasn't only about our parents. It just happened that way. You all have a place to go without the band. You have parents... You have older sisters... ... and younger ones. But what do I have? Su Ah was alone like me, so that's why I liked her even more. I wanted to protect her even more too, But I sent her away too. To protect this goddamn band! You still could have told me the truth. Did you not trust me? Hyun Soo, I never once thought of you as having quit the band. I was going to keep going with the others, until you came back. Let's stop here. Su Ah is more important to me... than you guys right now. Are you satisfied? [Su Ah] - Dad! - Su Ah. My daughter... I'm thankful to Seung Hoon. You've been through a lot, my daughter. - So I can live with you now? - Of course. Of course you can. But... But I think I have to go to China. - China? - Yeah. My friend is setting up a business there, but he's telling me to do it together. I asked him to look into schools for me too. I know that you might not want to leave your friends, but let's go together. [4th Place: Eye Candy 'Wake Up'] Aw, man. Such a good song... Hello, this is Kim Su Bok. What? Yes, yes. I'm Eye Candy's manager, Kim Su Bok. What? I came to see you. There must be something going on. That's right. You're a high schooler. - You must have been really bored. - I'm not bored. - I was having fun and came. - Yeah? - What were you doing? - Just... What does a kid who sings and plays in a band do to have fun? - I'm going to start looking, okay? - Fine. Do your best to look for it, if there is any. - You'll get bored right away. - I'm not bored! I'm glad no one is looking up to me as a leader anymore and I'm relieved not to do any promotions anymore. That contract's over, and I don't have anyone to answer to and-- - I'm relieved and happy. - Spewing nonsense now. That kind of guy came here alone? Given... after you play all you want, If something that you want to do turns up... ...that becomes something you want to do. Watch their performance and leave. I won't cry when I call you I won't become depressed It's become a part of our memories Become a part of our memories Become a part of our memories Until we die You didn't call for a few days Be it love or music, you just fall in love with it at first. But if that becomes real in your heart, it's insufferable afterwards. Like how falling in love is easy, but keeping that love going is hard. Become a part of our memories Become a part of our memories This punk... Acting all mature, but he's still a kid. - Keep your head up, dude. - I'm leaving. Oh oh, you're all here. Ji Hyuk's not here. - Just get together. Come here. - What? - What's going on? - Come here. - Who am I? - What? - You punks. Who am I, you punks? - Shil...Ba? - I'm Eye Candy's manager. - What are you talking about? - Eye Candy's been disbanded. - Right! But--! - There's an opportunity for you. - What opportunity? You've heard about Hallyu stars, right? That they're better received overseas than in Korea. - There's a chance for you like that. - Explain so we can understand. Truthfully, it might be tough for you to make it big in Korea. There are so many rumors about you. But you can start over in Japan. - Japan? Us? - Yeah, you punk. A Japanese company expressed interest in you guys. To whom? Eye Candy's manager. Me. Kim Su Bok. Do you feel a bit better now? A guy like you is lonely to the bone. What do you know how to do? You only know how to play music. At the end of the day, a guy like you can only pursue music. Like me. Whether it's Japan or Korea, what will you do about Do Il's dad and Kyung Jong's mom? I know that. But for now, it's important that you guys are on board. If you guys say yes, we'll go after it. And Japan is a good opportunity for rock bands. What do you think? - Well, the problem is... - What is it? Not that... they said that Hyun Soo has to be a part of the deal. You can't! He's preparing for his solo album. We don't know how that will pan out so you can't make him waver. What kind of sacrifice did Ji Hyuk make by sending Hyun Soo away... If it doesn't work out, both situations will fall through. It'll be hard for Ji Hyuk to open up too. Yeah? I thought you guys would be excited... Speaking of which... do you want to play with me? To find out what kind of music you want to do, to find out if there is. Don't you want to find out? Huh? Why are you being so straightforward about it? What will you do if the witch finds out? Just them that we won't do it. We won't do it! Says who? Why is it up to you guys to make the decision? Shil Ba asked us about playing in Japan. China? You're leaving for China? Because my dad is going... I regretted a lot of things. Stay here. Let's reconsider Japan. Let's not create headlines again. I tied everything up, so don't go making a mess of things again. I'm not sure if we'll regret it later... but don't you think it's come to a point where we have to live our own lives? Before I finish my album, I want to dedicate a song to someone. Who? I quit school. Then is Eye Candy disbanded? Subtitles by DramaFever
