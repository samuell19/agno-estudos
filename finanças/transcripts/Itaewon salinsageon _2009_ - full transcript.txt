(This movie) (is based on a true story that happened) (in an American hamburger restaurant.) (The people, story, and detailed) (depictions in this movie are fiction.) (Spring 1997, Itaewon) (Where the Truth Lies) (Jung Jin Young) (Jang Keun Suk, Shin Seung Hwan) (Oh Kwang Rok, Ko Chang Seok) - Hello, Prosecutor. - Yes, hello. Did you secure the witness? No, we don't have any yet. There must've been a lot of people at 10... We're still questioning. Identify the victim? Cho Joong Pil, a senior at Dongik University. He came with his girlfriend, and was murdered in the bathroom. What was the time of death? It was 10:30 p.m. inside the ambulance car. Where is it? You're here, professor? Prosecutor Park Dae Sik. Did you tell me to come to see it cleaned? What happened? According to the guys, they got a call at night. And they needed to work... Identification took the pictures, right? They took pictures for about half an hour. They're fooling around. He got murdered in a cramped place. There's nothing left. I know. They cleaned up so well... Where was the body? Next to the urinal on the left. The corner. He was slumped against the wall. Where was the blood? The sink next to the corner was wet, and there was a lot of blood on the walls. Then above the urinal on the right, there were marks from a spray. Here? Yes. What's this? Looks like they didn't clean everything. 3 here, 2 here, and 4 here. A total of 9 stab wounds. He was just 23. Geez... What kind of guy does this in Itaewon? The victim was the youngest... The only son in 3 generations. His father drove a bus. - They were humble people. - No... I should've given him more allowance. He was always working to pay for school. He never got to take a break. - Stop it. - Joong Pil... Stop it! Will that bring him back? Excuse me, prosecutor... That was his girlfriend. She was with him. Who? There. We were studying at the library, and we came out for a few beers. And... Get home safely. Call, okay? - Excuse me. - Hey. Ah, that's nice... Geez... Where should we go? Somewhere fun? It's already so late... Should we spend the whole night together? Hey... Joong Pil... Joong Pil! Do you remember anything else? Anything at all. Even something small. Hey... There might be things you missed. So think carefully. Did you feel anything different or strange about that night? When he was taking you home, did anyone follow you? Or... look at you without reason? - Detective Lee. - Yes. Who? That's what we want to know… So... - Who followed you? - I don't know. Of course not. Dad, that is wrong! Did the sun rise from the west? Why are the Americans acting now? They always take the guys we catch and say they'll investigate them. They just gave him to us. I don't know why they're doing that. How old is he? 18. He goes to an American high school. He doesn't look American. His father is Mexican. Works for the U.S. military. His mother is Korean. Does he speak Korean? He can't. It was hard investigating him. We need to be able to talk to him... He just keeps speaking English. It was so frustrating… Isn't he pretending? You know how to speak Korean, right? Korean. You must've learned from your mom! This guy... He's a good actor, huh? You thoughtless idiot! It's a pleasure. You can call me Nancy. In accordance with the administrative agreement set by the U.S. and Korea, we will announce a few items that must be kept while investigating suspect Robert J. Pierson. As a member of the U.S. army, if U.S. authorities request guidance of custody for the personnel or their family, you must consider their request and any statements made by the suspect without the presence of a U.S representative will not be used as evidence of guilt. Also, if handcuffs are placed without proper... You were in a hamburger restaurant in Itaewon on April 8, at 10 p.m., right? You were in a hamburger restaurant restroom in Itaewon on April 8, around 10, right? Why did you kill him? You must've had a reason to kill. How did you know the victim? Interpret. How do you know him? It was the first time I saw him. He said it's the first time he saw him. Did you get in a fight? So, you got in a fight? Why follow him into the bathroom? I had to take a piss. So you killed him on your way to piss? What did you do in the bathroom? I just saw it. See what? The Korean guy getting stabbed. What did he just say? Everyone focus! Tell me who else was in the bathroom. One Korean, and A.J. That Korean is dead. We're finding A.J. right now. Then we'll know that you lied. You still didn't do it? Why can't you answer me? Whatever. I didn't kill him. This knife, clothes, shoes, they're all yours, right? Look at this blood. You still say you didn't do it? You killed him, so you hid them in a locker! Hello? Yes. Prosecutor. It's Detective Kim from Yongsan. Hello? Who's Alex Jung? A.J.? You found him? I go to the U.S. often on business. I couldn't focus on my son. I didn't know he was running around with such low-quality people. How scared must he have been to see such a horrible scene? He... may look like this, because he's immature, right But he's very kind and sweet. I got it. It won't take long. Okay. Alex, be honest, okay? Tell the truth, okay? Yes, let's begin. Your name is Alex Turner Jung? Call me Alex. How old are you? 17. You don't speak Korean? 17. He's... 18 in Korean age. What's your permanent address? What? What's that? New York. It's only been 3 months since he came in. Father, please be quiet. Alex, you answer. Okay? I mean... ask me important questions. I'll tell you everything. What's important? What's important is... what happened inside the bathroom. I saw that Korean guy die. A.J., you want to get a burger? Yeah. I'm starving, man. Check it out. Dude, it's like the ones you see in movies. Man, that's tight? It's too good to cut hamburgers with. Yo, let me check this out. Where did you get it? From Itaewon market. Shoot! Are you okay? Geez... Dang. He just touched it and he's bleeding. This is the shit! I even stabbed someone before. For real? Did he die? I didn't check. Woah. Someone died? No, we were just talking about some movie. Cut the act. Is that all you can talk about when Michael's hurt? - You okay? - Dude, I'm fine. Yo, let's just go for a smoke. Let's stay a little longer. No, we'll be late. I drank too much beer. I'll just go to the bathroom, okay? - Hurry. - Hey... You're shitting me, huh? It'll be funny if it happens here, huh? What are you saying? I'll show you something cool. Come with me. Shoot... What's this? My God! God... What was the reason? You wanted to act like you were in a movie? You won't talk, huh? Bring him in. Hey, how do you feel? Alex. Yeah. You're meeting for the first time, right? Yeah. How long have you known him? I met him after I came to Korea... Hey, how long has it been? Maybe around 3 months? That long? You heard, right? About 3 months... You were together in the hamburger restaurant bathroom on the night of April 8, right? Who killed the Korean boy? Pierson. I didn't. What are you saying? You killed him! I didn't kill him. Don't lie! You stabbed him! Don't lie! No, I didn't kill him. This guy killed him! He did it! Pierson said that Alex killed him? Geez... He's not your average guy. Did you get a confession from Pierson? If you look at the CID investigation records it says that the confessed to the crime right after to Michael. Not that... Did he confess to the police? No, the CID already says... We already had the confession, so I... You didn't even get a confession? Don't you know that's the most important? You said that you did it at the CID. Why are you denying it now? I'm not trash. Those investigators treated me like trash. I didn't kill him. I don't know what the heck was written there. So are you saying Alex did it? Then why did you hide the knife? Because A.J. is my friend. Geez... Dang. He just touched it and he's bleeding. This is great! Put that away right now. He got hurt because of you. What did you take out the knife for? What? To hit on Shelly? Man, give me the knife. You don't even know how to use it? Have you ever stabbed someone? What? Have you ever killed someone? Whoa whoa whoa. Sombody killed sombody? No. We were just talking about some movie. Stop acting stupid. Is that all you guys can talk about when Michael's hurt? Dude, I'm fine. Yo, let's just go out for a smoke. Hilarious. Go. Stab anybody. You don't have the guts to do that. Shoot, A.J., are you high? I'll show you something cool. Come with me. Shoot. A.J.! A.J.! What? Not going well? He's saying someone else did it... Want some help? I'll give you a witness testimony. I'm not in a joking mood. There are no other witnesses other than Alex and Pierson. Those who are alive anyway. This is the victim's autopsy. Wouldn't the dead victim be the real witness? It's as it's written. 3 times on the right side of the neck, 4 times on the left, twice in the chest. He's been stabbed 9 times. But there are no defense marks. Even 80-year-olds have defense marks. This means that the victim was overpowered at once. And the first knife mark on the right, it is slanting downwards. That means... the suspect is taller than the victim, and stronger. Are you saying... I need to overturn the investigation results? I didn't say that! You jerks! Pierson killed him! Prosecutor Park, one second. What happened? You're arresting the testifier? Alex is both the witness and an important suspect. What are you talking about? The CID already said that Pierson is the culprit. That's the CID's judgment. It's up to us now to reinvestigate. Prosecutor Park... I think you're mistaken. Alex is a witness. If he is, why didn't he report it for 3 days? What was he doing? I'll ask him what he did, okay? So are you saying Alex did it? It's not him. You're wrong. If I am, he'll be set free. Is he from the mountains? Why is he such an idiot? When you went to the bathroom, what was the victim doing? He was urinating. It wasn't me. Pierson is lying. I'll be the judge of that. And speak formally to me. Got it? I really didn't kill him. You said you hit the victim, but he didn't have any trace of that. What happened? Yeah, that's right. I didn't hit him. Just… Just pushed him. I washed my hand and lifted my head. But... Pierson was stabbing him in the neck. Then what did you do? I was scared... So... I just kept looking at the mirror... That's it? Nothing else? I told you. I was so scared. You just saw Pierson stab him from beginning to end, right? - That's right... - Okay, great. Then what did you see? Then? I can't remember... The blood splashed all over when A.J. stabbed him in the neck. How many times did he stab him? Right neck 3 times, and here, about 4 times? And twice in the heart. After the blood flowed, the victim turned around and flailed his arms. Did you see it? I saw it. He turned around and he shook his arms at Pierson. Then what? Then? What did he say? Beat him. Then he'll tell you the truth. Have you heard of 'dissociative response'? Most murderers can't remember their actions after seeing their victims' blood. It's common knowledge in criminal psychology. Especially if the suspect was on drugs. So both of them tested negative for drugs? Yes. But that's strange. According to CID records, it said that Pierson was on drugs that day. Detective Kim, what about Alex's drug record? All you do is talk about the CID. Are you investigating for them? I'm sorry. Then do your job! That jerk! How dare that prosecutor! Yeah, that arrogant fool... Geez... Still, be patient. Does it look like I can? Right now, Alex... is being treated as a murderer... It'll be difficult if the investigating prosecutor starts being biased. We'll need something big... How about using a lie detector? It can't be used as legal evidence, but we can use it to convince the prosecutor. Then... We'll know right away Pierson is lying? Let's use it right away. Okay. Are you the one who killed Cho Joong Pil in the restroom? No. Are you the one who stabbed Cho Joong Pil in the neck and chest in the restroom? No. Are you the one who stabbed Cho Joong Pil? No. Are you the one who stabbed Cho Joong Pil in the neck and chest in the restroom? No. Prosecutor. You asked Pierson the questions in English, and Alex the questions in Korean? Is it wrong to speak Korean to a Korean? I mean... Alex only looks like a Korean. But he talks and acts like an American. You know that! Prosecutor... I just can't understand, okay? Pierson is the criminal... You received the evidence from CID, right? This isn't the U.S. It's Korea. In Korea, all official investigations are conducted by Korean prosecutors. Let's not be this way... Let's grab a drink. I'm sure you have things you want to tell me. Hey! I've been patient, okay? You need to get off your high horse! Here. David. Yeah. Jake. When are we getting out of this place? When can they leave? Tell them it'll be over soon. It'll be finished soon. Michael. Michael Osborn. Michael Osborn... Why is he the only one not here? Michael was key in pointing out Pierson as the suspect. Michael Osborn is an American citizen and you need to know that. He's been having a difficult time. The family of the victim is even more. What's so hard about coming in and talking to us? Michael, as part of the SOFA agreement... Forget it! Just tell him to forget it! You can't let go, okay? I won't. If you keep saying that I will. Hey. Hey, I'm going to tell mom on you. Do it. - This is Shin Won Dong. - It's your bike. It's me. Michael Osborn. You were with Pierson that night, right? Yes. According to your testimony to CID, you said that you heard Pierson say he committed the crime at the restaurant. Is that true? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't know. Then why did you tell the CID that? Well... I asked Pierson where the blood came from. He told me some Korean came and pushed him... I don't know. Maybe I heard it wrong. Then... Did you hear someone say at the restaurant, 'I'll show you something, follow me?' Is that true? Yes. Who said that? Michael, listen to me. One of your friends murdered an innocent person and is lying about it. I know that you're having a hard time because of your friends. But killing someone is unforgivable. Now... who's lying? The U.S. army got the wrong person? Yes. The autopsy results, testimony consistencies and all kinds of evidence show that Pierson is not the criminal. Then Pierson's been falsely charged? This might get messy. Alex comes from a wealthy family, right? Well if we take that into consideration, how can we do our job? Don't go overboard. Just send it to trial. Anything else you want to say? I'll keep the case. You'll have plenty of opportunities. Prosecutor Park. Are you sure you can handle this? (Seoul District Court No. 22, case 97) (Alex Turner Jung for murder, ) (Robert J. Pierson for weapons possession) (and destruction of evidence.) Case number 97 Let the trial of 386 cases begins now. Defendant, please enter. - You jerk! - Murderer! Crazy idiot. Please be quiet. - Murderer! - Be quiet. Prosecution, please give your statement. The defendant, Alex Turner Jung, at 10 p.m. on April 8, 1997 at a hamburger restaurant in Itaewon was eating hamburgers with four friends including Robert J. Pierson. He told Pierson to follow him after telling him he wants to show him something. He stabbed victim Cho Joong Pil who was relieving himself in the bathroom with this weapon a total of 9 times. How dare you do this to my Joong Pil? What did he ever do wrong? - Please be quiet. - Why did you kill him? How dare you accuse him? Please be quiet! We can't conduct the trial if you interrupt. Do it again, and I will have you removed. Please provide your statement in writing. Is it true that you were close with Pierson? Yes. What kind of friend was Pierson? He was dangerous. In what way? He always had a knife and he wanted to do things with them. Objection. This is his own assumptions. I request that it is deleted from the record. Yes, please delete it from the record. Lawyer, please continue. What did you talk about with him that night? Pierson... how do you say it? I mean... He wanted to hit people walking past... Mug people? Mug people! He wanted to do that. But he didn't try even once. Why not? He always said he got scared. But... he said it would be fun to do. Has he ever said these things? No. That day... he kept harassing me so I didn't remember. Prosecutor. Why does the court keep discussing Pierson? Isn't this about Alex? I don't understand what's going on... The opposition wants the case to go around Pierson. They don't have the confidence to prove that Alex's claims are true. That's why they're ripping Pierson apart. They are horrible people... That's how trials usually are. Don't worry. I know this must be difficult... but please do this in honor of Joong Pil. Please. Go, go. Prosecutor Kim, do it! Push him. - Pass the ball. - Get out. Block him. - There you go. - Get out. Come here. - Pass the ball. - Geez. Do it! Not much of a team player, are you? Why don't you just convict both? If Alex isn't found guilty, don't you have to question Pierson? They could have been plotting together. But only one person is responsible for this. How can we convict an innocent person? How can you think such things? Are you really a prosecutor? Is it true that you were at an Itaewon hamburger restaurant on April 8th at 10 p.m.? Yes. Why were you there? I was hanging out in Sky High up on the 4th floor, I got hungry so I went for a burger. But wasn't Alex and Pierson with you, too? Yes. Where were you sitting? I was sitting right next to the bathroom. And then... So, next to Alex and across from Pierson? I think so. Did you see this knife there? Yeah. Pierson took it out to cut a burger. Who's the person... who held this knife last between those two people? Well... A.J. did put the knife in his pocket, but I don't know if he was the last one. Didn't you tell the prosecution that Alex was the last person who had it? That time I did... We were all going out for a smoke, so I don't really know what Alex did after that. I see. Did you hear the words 'I'll show you something. Come with me?' Yeah. Can you say that again? I'll show you something cool. Come with me. Who said those words? Prosecutor Park. Why don't you say hello? Nice work, lawyer. Not at all... You made the right choice for a friend. Let's go, I'll take you. Sure. Did something go wrong? Jake changed what he said. Bring the witness testimony records. What are you talking about? The U.S. army, the police, and our records. Don't you have the original? No, we don't. We didn't need to do that... Who translated this? A drafted policeman. Why would he do that? He was an English major and got 540 on his TOEFL exam. He's the best we have. Bring him here. He's been discharged. It's been about 10 days... Section Chief Choi. Yes? Bring the interpreter at the police station. He's no longer here. He went to study abroad. You guys must be joking... I can't believe it. When did you leave the restaurant after eating the hamburger? When the guys were taking turns with the knife, I thought it was cheesy so I left first. I came out the emergency exit and I was smoking. Shelly, Michael, and Jake came out to smoke too, right? Yeah. Did you stay with them? No. Shelly and Michael went to Sky High first, and then Jake. And you also went to Sky High after a while, too? Yeah. When did you actually see... Alex leave the bathroom exactly? What? No. You must not have seen. You didn't see Alex come out of the bathroom, or come out of the emergency exit. You saw him walk up the stairs, right? According to your testimony, you said you saw both of them while going up to Sky High. But when I went on-site, I saw that you cannot see the exit when looking downstairs. Therefore, to be exact, what you saw was two people go up the stairs. Witness. Is this true or false? Witness. Even so, you saw Alex go up first, and then Pierson, right? Yeah. So because he went up the stairs first, means he left the bathroom first? That doesn't make sense. What kind of logic is that? Alex and Pierson stated that they did not see each other after leaving the bathroom. Then doesn't that mean they left the bathroom and ran up the stairs? As you know, the hamburger restaurant had an official exit to the road. So are you saying that Pierson left the bathroom first, all bloody, and then passed the hamburger restaurant hall, then through the main door to the road, and then went back to run up the stairs? After waiting for Alex to go up first? I will ask the witness. After the incident, you said that Alex Turner Jung's clothes had blood on it as if it had been sprayed, but Robert J. Pierson's face and head and body were all covered with blood. Is that true? Yeah. Taste good? It's all my fault. I should've just left you in the U.S. How is it? The food is terrible, and the room is so dirty. I can't stay there. Bring me out. I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy, too. But... until the final verdict, there's nothing we can do. Jake said it. I don't want to see him anymore! He makes me sick! That fool. The people who testified... There's... a lot of evidence against you. I should've showed them... What? Huh? What? Nothing... So according to your testimony, The wound on the right is the first. That's right. How does blood usually flow from here? Because of the carotid artery, it sprays. So how would it look like on clothes? It would look like it is sprayed. So would the blood, like Alex claims, spray onto Alex as he was washing his hands by the sink? Even as Pierson was blocking him? It doesn't spray like water... If someone was in front of him... So... Would it be impossible? Yes, I think it would be. You are currently an associate professor? Yes. What is your major? Forensic Science. From a forensic point of view, who do you think stabbed the victim, Alex or Pierson? Objection. Continue. It's difficult to tell... If only one person was responsible, and if the first attack was a stab to the right side of the victim's neck... I would say that the person who had blood sprayed on them... Shut up! Be quiet! If you interrupt again I'll have you removed. Can you tell me exactly who you believe is the murderer? If it's too much to ask for, it's alright. That will be all. This was taken right after the incident. As you can see, there is a lot of blood on the edge of the sink. Pierson said that he was standing by the sink and watching the incident, when the victim came into contact with him. Then how could the blood get on the sink this way? Well... While the victim was spilling blood, and he fell on Pierson, if Pierson moved backwards with all that blood, wouldn't that be possible? That sounds like some scenario. Do you think that's possible? Pierson said that he pushed the victim. So does that mean the victim, who fell next to the toilet, got back up and left blood near the sink, then fell back against the toilet? Do you think that is actually possible? He was stabbed 9 times. I can't say for sure. Witness. Did you actually see what you said earlier? How did it go today? The professor's testimony was clear. I'm glad it went well. We won't know until it's over... Are... you not going home? You guys go ahead. Prosecutor, we'll get going... It's cold. - Water gun! - What about me? You always do what you want to do... What? I want to do it too... It's cold. It's cool, not cold, okay? It's cold. You try it. It looks like it'll be cool. It's cold. The water's cold. Come here! - Stop... - Ji Oh, Ji Sun come here. Dad, he won't let me play with it. Yeah? Give the water gun to me. Ji Sun, stand here. - What are you doing? - Stand here? No. Ji Sun, stand here. Look at me. Ji Oh, stand behind me. - Stand close. - Why? Okay. What are you doing? - Geez... - Did you get sprayed Ji Sun? No. Ji Oh, stand there again. Again? Why? Dad, stop it. That was lucky. What's wrong with you today? - Geez... - Ji Oh. Do you have a water gun that sprays? There's no such thing, okay? Really... Never mind. What am I doing? Ji Sun, I'm sorry. Geez, Dad! Hey. You said that the victim was bleeding when he pushed up against you? Yeah. Where did he push you? Um, maybe around here. Your Honor, please recall that investigation record 59 attachment 2 indicates that the probability of a lot of blood reaching someone nearest to the victim is high, given the way it pours from an arterial occlusion. Regarding that... please refer to investigation record 126. Was that submitted? Yes. According to the testimony from the first person who came to this scene, the victim had fallen with his pants slightly down. Normally, when you urinate, don't you lower your pants and bend your legs? So he would've been at least 10cm shorter than his normal height. Then, if a person smaller than the victim - stabbed him... - Objection. The lawyer is talking about unfounded things as if they are true. I'm speaking generally. Generally, when you urinate, you lower your head. This isn't some silent prayer... But, the victim had his pants down. What I'm talking about now, is someone who lowered their pants and was urinating. Even if that's true, you usually stand with your legs apart. If you don't want your pants to fall, you bend your legs. That's common sense. Lawyer, do you bend your legs when you urinate? Why would I? Hey, Prosecutor Park. I'm your senior. How dare you? Why are you saying that? Are we at a picnic? Be quiet. We'll stop here for today. That air conditioner needs to get fixed. I apologize, Prosecutor. No, it happens. But... he's very odd. What? Didn't Alex laugh earlier? Or... was it Pierson? Did he? You didn't hear? It was a bit hectic. He seemed calmer today... Is that so? If you're both doing this... We can't conduct the trial. There are a lot of trials these days. Please understand my situation. I do. But I don't urinate like that. So we need to conduct an on-site review for some issues... I see. Do you consent? What? To the on-site review. Of course. - Come out. - Move. Pierson, please give us a statement. - Get out of the way. - Alex! - How do you feel? - Stop it. Why are you doing this? - It's Alex. - How do you feel? Why a hamburger restaurant? - Please look here. - Just one word. How do you feel? Alex, please tell us how you feel. Calmly, okay? Please tell us how you feel. Talk according to the script, okay? The world knows that you're innocent! - The whole world knows! - Please look here. You're not even insects! - Who are you? - What? - You're so shameless. - Is she crazy? You don't even look like you have remorse! - Scumbag! - Murderer! The entire world knows... Bastard! Murderer! - Please look here. - One moment. What was the motive? Please move to the scene o the crime. I just came in to wash my hands. Don't turn it on. Just act like you are. Okay. I was washing my hands and lifted my head... Pierson... He came in. (Pierson) Now, run into the victim. I don't have enough room. Prosecutor, Pierson is starting. Is that so? Let's go inside. I followed A.J. into the restroom. Then I went to the sink and looked at him but suddenly, he stabbed the Korean. How many times? He stabbed him in the neck. Uh, 3 times on the right, 4 times on the left, and then twice in the heart. Alex, stab him. (Alex) No. Not there. In the back of the neck. And you're holding it wrong. Can you do it yourself? I saw A.J. stabbing him, and the Korean guy fell on me. Not this way... This way. What is this? Are you fooling around? What is this? I'm glad we came to do the on-site review. The next trial will be on September 8th. Is he Pierson's lawyer or what? Hey, have another drink. Ah, I drank too much already... Drink. You never really drank with me before, right? Who do you think is the criminal? Isn't that an obvious question? It's Alex. Are you serious? Yes. Whatever. You thought it was Pierson. You talked about the CID, and me behind my back, right? I'm asking you man to man. Who is it? Geez... Prosecutor, you're persistent. I'm sorry. It's my fault. That's what you want to hear, right? I thought it was Pierson at first, too. But during the on-site review, I saw that you were right. That fat jerk was high and stabbed him. He tested negative for drugs. Drugs like ruminal can't get detected yet. What about Pierson's confession? He's Mexican and his mother is from the army. Do you think they'll treat him like a person? They just want to send away guys who are a nuisance to them. You really think it's Alex? Why are you doing this? Do you really think it's Alex? Prosecutor... If you don't know, just take a guess. You have a 50% chance, right? What? Jerk... Who does he think I am? Jerk... Driver, let's stop by the bathroom. I'll show you something cool. Come with me. Alex, it's you, right? Pierson, is it you? Stop here! Stop here! What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! I said stop it! Jerks! Can't you hear me? He'll die. Come out! What are you doing in there? What are you doing? Open the door you jerks! Open the door! Excuse me... Hi. Alex is the criminal. You're not the criminal... but you have a lot of flaws. Presently, he has a 4 dot tattoo, but when we were investigating him in CID, it was a 3 dot tattoo. The 3 dot tattoo on the left hand is a gang marking that means 'My Crazy Life.' Based on what I already told you, CID is positive that he is a member of a Hispanic gang known as 'Norte 14.' However, the Korean prosecution silenced this opinion by the CID. Why do you think they did so? I don't know. The Korean prosecution is expressing that they cannot trust the opinion of the CID because it is not an official investigation organization. That is why they don't trust the results. If it isn't too much to ask, can you tell me what kind of organization the CID is? CID is an official federal organization of investigation with power equal to the FBI. I've been an investigator with the CID for 15 years. And I specialize in gangs and juvenile crime. That will be all. A.J. and Pierson's friends went down to the hamburger restaurant. After a while A.J. came to our table but his clothes were bloody. What is this? What did you do? We did it. We just stabbed somebody in the neck. You killed someone? For what? Can you say that one more time? Why did Alex say he killed him? He said he did it for fun. Is that a person? Is he telling the truth? How can you kill someone for fun? Is that a person? What is the world coming to? How can you kill someone for fun? (Itaewon Hamburger Restaurant Murder) (Motive was for fun...) (Angry public) The world is insane... Do you know what we need most now? Standards. That's how law and justice can stand. Take care of it until the end. Killed someone for fun? All 6 trials are now concluded. Lastly, I'll ask as a person, not a judge. I'll ask 2 questions. I hope that both of you answer these questions honestly as a person, not as defendants. Is one of you the criminal? Yeah. Yeah. I'll ask Alex Turner Jung first. Who murdered Cho Joong Pil? Pierson. I'll ask Robert J. Pierson. Who murdered Cho Joong Pil? It's Alex. The person next to me. Prosecutor, set the penalty. One Korean man has died. He came from a poor family, and worked to stay in school. He was the hope and pride of the family. He died one night without reason. Defendant Alex Turner Jung may be only 18 years old, but he killed someone for fun. During this trial, he denied his crime and is passing his crime to his friend. By pushing his U.S. citizenship, he is ridiculing the legal system in Korea. This kind of suspect does not deserve any mercy. I ask... that he receives the ultimate penalty... capital punishment. Me? I didn't do it! Please stand. Defendant, please enter. That crime was absolutely terrible. The method, risks, and results of the crime were absolutely horrible. In light of many circumstances, including compensation for the victim's family, which cannot even be provided, we sentence defendant Alex Turner Jung to life imprisonment. For Robert J. Pierson, - What. - we sentence him to 1 year 6 months for possession and - destruction of evidence. - Get out! What is this nonsense? - Let me go! - It wasn't me! - This is invalid! - It wasn't me! What are you guys saying? - It's invalid! - You idiots! - Do it again! - I didn't kill him! I'll kill all of you! - He's coming. - Turner Jung! Alex! Alex, don't worry okay? I'll make sure you go free! Alex! Don't worry! I'll make sure to get you! I don't need you to thank me. Wait... Tell me one thing. It's Alex, right? Merciful Buddha... Our Joong Pil has entered paradise. Help me to live a comfortable life. We reviewed the trial log. This fight... we can't win. We can't win... but I'll make sure you won't lose. As pointed out in the original trial, while the victim was in the bathroom, the defendant and Pierson went in and someone stabbed the victim multiple times and murdered him. However, the defendant and Pierson named each other as the culprit, and themselves as the witness. Due to this, there was a need to see who was telling the truth between the two of them. A. Regarding the situation before entering the bathroom, because it wasn't investigated doesn't mean the charge was improper. It is difficult to say that the defendant was the only criminal in this crime. - It's wrong. - What? What do you mean? B. The forensic science opinion used during the original trial was a general opinion. The victim's stance when urinating is a variable, and the defendant's use of drugs was not stated in the records. Therefore, we are repealing the sentence and sending this case to the Seoul High Court. - Sir. - What? What are you doing? Nice! Great job. Good job. Dad! Alex! My son... It's done. It's finished. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Alex. The angels are on our side. Congratulations. Alex is found innocent? What happens now? Leave this to the prosecutor, and go home. The prosecutor said that he'll collect the evidence and send it again. The Supreme Court says he's innocent... is that possible? If they say he is, isn't he? Please prosecute Pierson again. It's either one or the other, so if one is innocent, the other is guilty. They both said so. That can't happen. Pierson's already been sentenced. Even if we prosecute him again, he'll be found innocent. Just like Alex. That doesn't make sense... What kind of law is that... Sir... Prosecutor... Please say something... Please? Prosecutor... If they all didn't kill him... who killed my son? Huh? Who killed my son? Mom... - My poor Joong Pil. - Mom... Mom... Joong Pil... Joong Pil... A search warrant? Yes. I am confident I can find new evidence that points to Alex as the criminal. Are you out of your mind? What will you find at a lawyer's office? The defendant manipulated testimonies during the trial. The appeal submitted to the Supreme Court is also suspicious. If we show that... I can win this again. The court's judgment isn't that Alex is innocent, but that there is no 100% evidence. That's why I'm saying I'll find that evidence. Look here. No one will say that you did anything wrong during the investigation. Let go of this. There are many more criminals that you need to catch other than Alex. Alex, it's been a while. Wow, your office is amazing. You're doing well these days? I am. How have you been? I got into university but studying is such a chore. Life is about overcoming those things. Hey Na Young. Hello. Hello. What do you want to drink? No, we have an appointment. Here... Dad was busy. He wanted me to give you this. What is this? I'll go. Be well. Who's that? A lawyer who helped me before. For what? You don't need to know. What? I'm curious. What was it? I suffered a lot. But it was interesting. Interesting? What was? Tell me. Are you really curious? I'll show you something. Follow me. It's a really interesting story. Wow, really? I was drunk with my friends and I got hungry. I went to eat a hamburger at a restaurant. But Pierson pulled out a knife. A knife? And? I don't remember. What's that? Your kids will suffer if they transfer again. It would've been nice if you were in Seoul. I'm upset you're leaving so suddenly. Section Chief Choi. How many prosecutors have you worked with? Around 8? How am I compared to them? You're the best, of course. I shouldn't have asked. Well, I have to go. I'm not that great of a prosecutor. But... I saved you. I got it. I didn't kill him. I'm sure of that, and you are too, right? Pierson. You're good at Korean, huh? I learned it from jail. Miss. The bathroom... What happened? Something bad happened there. So we blocked it off. (Alex was declared innocent and released) (by the High Court in 1998.) (Pierson was released in 19982 months) (before his sentence was over.) (Because his 1999 departure ban was not) (extended, he left to the U.S. the next day.) (Alex and Pierson are completely free) (from all legal responsibility.)
