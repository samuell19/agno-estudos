(technological music) (rock music) (somber music) (flame brews) (monster growls) (drill whirs) (dramatic music) (rock smashes) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (water flowing) - Dr. Shaw. I'm very impressed with your briefing, however, there are a few points on which I beg to differ. Can we take a walk? - Yes. - Dr. Shaw, you may have convinced our commander-in-chief and members of the council, but I want you to know that I still prefer the military option. I mean, we can't rely on some off earth mining crews our final line of defense. We have got to hit Galileo's Child. Tactical nukes, strategic missiles, blow the sucker out of the air. - General Hurst, haven't you read any of my reports? Even if we could mass that amount of fire power, the resulting asteroid shower would destroy us. With a renegade moon this size, we must divert it away from earth. - General, I'm placing the entire resources of Nexecon behind this mission. I was hoping we could count on your support. - Well, unlike some of us, I have no financial ax to grind, no political favors to carry. I've been given an order by my commander-in-chief and I will carry that order out for now. - General, I resent your accusation. - Folks, this conversation is pointless. Time is on my side. Now we've got about six months before this moon is scheduled to impact the earth. That's enough time for you to accomplish this exercise in futility. - The decision's been made, General. - Yes, I know it has. And, as usual, I'll sit back and watch you fail and then I'll step in and save the day. Now if you'll both excuse me. I must die here, gents. Need a helicopter, ground transportation outta here. - Mr. Isaacs, I can guarantee. - Dana, don't worry about it. The nearest mining platform has been contacted and is on its way to intercept Galileo's Child. I've arranged for you to take a speed shuttle, which will get you there nine weeks from there. By that time, half the tunneling should be completed and you'll supervise the final phase of the operation. Are you sure three tunnels are enough? - Yes, as long as they have enough C4 to blow the reactor, we'll be fine. - More than enough. Now once the chargers are set, you and the crew will use the rover to return to the surface and then evacuate in a jettison pod. - And once we're in a safe orbit, we detonate. The tunnels will act like giant exhaust ports, altering Galileo's course. We won't fail. - Failure is not an option. Now you've got one of my best crews. - I know, I've read their files. Seven personnel in total. - You'll touch down and begin tunneling in approximately 72 hours. Now, Ryan's been known to be difficult. He plays hardball, but he's agreed to cooperate. He has asked that his crew be given a minimum amount of information regarding this operation. - Well, I'm sure under the circumstances, he's probably right. Okay, well, everything's in order. I'll leave immediately. - Excellent, may God's grace go with you. - Thank you. (dramatic music) (gentle music) (dramatic music) (machine whirring) (dramatic music) (machine beeps) (dramatic music) (case clicks) (dramatic music) - We're behind, we're not on schedule. Look, in the eight weeks before I arrived, you were supposed to stick to these distance targets. - Look, both of my crews are busting their asses out there. Ad I seriously doubt that a few yards are gonna make a big different in the long run. - Well, we're supposed to average 320 yards a day. Beta crew's short 25 yards. What's the problem? - Beats me, Doc. Might have something to do with the fact that we were making premium wages on minimum hours before we got volunteered for this little field trip of yours. - Oh, so it's about money? We have 90 days before the earth is going to be destroyed and you're talking to me about bonuses. - Like I said, I'll talk to my guys about it. Oh, and, uh, in the meantime, if you have any insights on drilling techniques you'd like to share with me, feel free. (dramatic music) - Let me take a look at the sonar. Oh, everything seems to be working okay. Cody. - [Cody] How we doin' Banton? - Oh, we're doing fine. It's your brother who's slowing us down. He's running about 30 yards short a day. - What do you expect? His choice of music sucks. You can't drill a rock listening to that classical crap. Now you pick me a disc buddy and let's rock. (heavy metal music) - Rock head. Okay, cooling level, check. Drill speed, check. Face temperature, check. Atmosphere, oh, a little dusty, but hey, I'm indoors so I don't give a damn. - Anyone up for a came of Battlescarz? - Check. Go and get the you know whats and I'll load her up. Oh, okay. - Where are we loaded and what are we overriding? - We are bypassing the closed circuit TV, microphone and monitors so we should be good- - [Together] For a 30-minute game. - Excellent. - Okay, victim, are we ready, huh? - Just start, okay. (upbeat music) (heavy metal music) - And now the sweet smell of victory begins to drift towards me. - Dammit. I have to beat you sometime. - Not in this lifetime. Let's face it. There's nothing you can't do on the computer, except beat me. - I hope your teeth fall out. - All right. - [Ryan] Wake up you block head. - Oh, shit. - I don't know what the hell is going on in there, but I'm telling you one thing. If you guys are in there jerking off your computer games or eating those fruity little yummy bars, I'm gonna come in there myself and I'm gonna whip you a brand new- - Um, I'm reading you loud and clear, Mr. Ryan. Temporarily line fall seemed to incapacitate the monitor to link up. - Tell it to the pixies, Banton. Now monitor the drill head and next time just admit it. Got it? - Yes, Mr. Ryan. - Good, don't forget it. - Schmuck. - Beg your pardon? - Oh, I didn't say anything, Mr. Ryan. - Get to work. - Shit, what the hell's going on here. - [Ryan] Beta girl, I want you to hit the drill at 1900 hours, shift meeting at 1830. Mr. Banton, I want a full system check on the drill head during cool down. You can eat later. I'll save something for you. - Tony, I'm shutting down on three, two, one. (drill whirs) (rock music) (crew chats indistinctly) - Here's your second helping. - Thanks. - That was, that was really smooth, man. You know, maybe by the time we get done with this job, you'll actually put more than a couple sentences together. I just hope you're making more progress with your test examples. - All right, everybody listen up. We've been on this rock, what is it now, not quite three months and already we've cut through 1-3/4 miles of tunnel. I think you're all aware of the implications, the importance of the work we're doing here and, needless to say, I think you're doing a fantastic job. I think you'll see how much I appreciate it when you get your bonuses. - All right (claps). - However, I am not the God of this rock and Dr. Shaw down here thinks you call could be doing a little bit more for the cause. So, consequently, we will now be moving to nine hour shifts. - That really isn't necessary. If beta crew would tunnel- - Sorry to cut you off, Doc, but you're the one who voiced a problem. I've come up with solution, so there's nothing left to discuss. All right, that's the way it is. Beta crew, you're up. Luke, Archer, we got a planet to save. Let's see the rocks fly out there. Before I forget, anyone take a look at the genny, it's like pea soup out there. - Man, what's the problem with the generator. I feel like I'm sucking sand all shift. - The problem's the damn schedule, see. These machines are designed to run, you know, 14 hours a day max, not 18, not 24. Generating a cloak of oxygen over and around a platform, it ain't like boiling the kettle. It's very, very, very complex. I'll see what I can do. - I guess you're feeling pretty popular now, huh? - We have to cut 320 yards a day. - Another hour's not gonna bother me and I know Luke feels the same way. I just wanna get this job done and go home. - Yeah, I'd like to make sure you got a home to go back to. - Hey, we're just the muscle. I mean, Ryan calls the shots. The word is this whole job's a scam anyway. - What? (buttons beep) (dramatic music) - Not too healthy. (dramatic music) It ain't the prairies, but it'll do. Dammit. Damn, you scared the hell outta me. - Just keeping you on your toes, bud. How's it coming? - It's better than it was. I adjusted the timing cycle, I isolated the coolant rods. Still only running 80%. - 80% is fine. If we get before these atmosphere generators, you and me are wearing full containment suits and we're still cutting through 250 yards a day. - Yeah, we got up a half hour before we went to bed, too, didn't we? I gotta go check on the processors and the conveyors. - Well, I don't wanna keep you. - Why don't you kick them in about 0200. She should be asleep by then. So, uh, how's it going down there? - Not too hot. We processed maybe 17 pounds of platinum. - 17? Is that it? - Don't blame me. This moon ain't mining material. We got low platinum content, plus, you know, having to run the processors on the sly. We damn sure ain't gonna break any records on this one. - Well, it makes you appreciate how good we've had it lately, huh? - I guess Nexecon thought saving the earth was the thing to do, huh? - What are you in dreamland? Nexecon cut a deal with the military. Isaacs gets a piece of the action for setting up this little operation and when it fails, which it will, the military gets reinstated to do the inevitable, kaboom, done. Everybody makes out but us. - Once again, your blue collar worker gets the shaft. Just the way of the world, I guess. - And they expect us to save it for free. - I gotta go. - [Alarm] Adversarial danger, proceed no further. - What? - Just checking. - You wanna let me know the next time you're checking the alarm. - I wasn't checking the alarm, I was checking to see if you could still run with that big fat ass of yours. - You're really funny, man. You're killing me, really. - It's not me that's killing you, it's the meatloaf. (dramatic orchestral music) - Okay, Luke, four hours to go. And it seems you're hitting a dense layer. I'll bring you up to full speed. Try the drill first. If you have no joy, we'll get Nuke-em out there to do her stuff. - Copy that. It's no good. We're just grinding teeth out here. Give Ryan a call. - I'm on it. Switching off the drill. - 30 minutes to change the drill head, how deep's the layer? - I'd say maybe 7 feet, but it's extremely dense. I've never seen anything like it. The sonar's only penetrating the surrounding rock. - Well, get Nuke-em out there. She can set the chargers and blow a 7 foot seam in 10 minutes. All right, Luke can continue with the standard drill head, all right. I'm on my way over there now. - Okay, so I'm gonna lay a ring of six chargers here. That'll blow the core and weaken the surrounding rock. I'm using a plus 4 charge head, so that'll definitely get us the penetration that we need. - Well, good. I'm all for a little penetration. Well, geez, I hope you didn't take that the wrong way. (gun blasts) - Nice shootin', Tex. - Thanks. - I still don't how that thing'll work. - Look, a small charge in the base of the drill thread burrows into the rock. Once it's in, I electronically explode the magnet charge in the center. - Mm. - This part goes in, this part explodes. Watch. Fire in the hole. (rock explodes) Toasty. - What the hell? - Hey, wait, wait. Give the oxygen cloak time to extend. - What the hell have we got here? (dramatic music) Holy Christ. (eerie music) - Oh. - It's real cold. - It's metal. - Not just metal. Solid platinum. Gravy train. - Why have we stopped drilling? My God. - Am I crazy or does that think look like your mother-in-law? - My mother-in-law ain't that cute. - I got figure out how to get one of these panels off. I think we have to wait for the drills on these things. - What is it? - It looks like a carbon fossilized life form. - Human? - I don't know, but it's definitely a biped, but it's got this over developed system of armor plates connected to its skeleton. And look at that. See the position of the teeth, the shape of the jaw. Yeah, this was carnivore. (metal clanks) Wait, stop, what are you doing? - We're taking our bonuses. It's called the spoils of war, Doc. - Are you crazy? Stop. Look, we have to continue tunneling. Maybe we can stop for a few minutes and document it. Take samples and photographs, but that's it. We have to stay on schedule. - Yeah, no, no, no, you don't understand. If we do stop now, we take the platinum off the walls and then we go back to tunneling, got it? - This operation is under my jurisdiction. You are here to facilitate my mission and do your job period. - Yeah, you wanna know how I see it? I didn't ask for this job in the first place, and in the end when we're through dickin' around on this rock, the military's just gonna step in and blow the whole thing up anyways. So, I think we might as well make a little money along with everybody else, hmm? - Well, I don't know where you got your information from, but we examined the military option. You see the bomb and balls brigade didn't have a clue. They just saw a problem and they wanted to blow it up, but they didn't stop to think about the resulting asteroid shower. Chunks of rock the size of Kansas, raining down on the earth. - Ryan never mentioned this. - Surely that's not too far over your head. - The fact that you're a woman is the only reason you're still standing up right now. What do you got in mind there? - Try me. (gun clicks) All right, one hour. Then we continue tunneling. - Shift's over in an hour and a half. - Then make it up tomorrow. - Make it up tomorrow (laughs). Archer, do you copy? - [Archer] Copy. - Get Cody and get your asses down here on the double. I want you to bring pick axes and pneumatic drills. You got it? - Got it. (rock music) - Excellent work, guys. We're gonna make some money today, huh? - Yeah, some more than others. - Well, I think we got about 400 pounds. - That's a lot of shiny shiny. Even after we've paid off the grunts. - Let's go get some chow. - Yeah, you go on ahead. Take that. Get me an accurate total as soon as you can, right. (camera clicks) - All by your lonesome? Want some protection? Want some company? - No, thank you, I'm fine. - I was just thinking, um, you were here, so technically you're entitled to a share of the profits. Do you have any idea what the market value of platinum is? - I suppose if you found the Dead Sea Scrolls, you'd use them as toilet paper. - So pure. Well, whatever. You get your photos and get to discover a new civilization. We make a little money. Everybody goes home happy. I was just thinking it might not be a bad idea for us to kiss and make up. (gentle music) Oh. (dramatic music) (buttons click) (man blows) - Attention, attention boys and girls. Shutting down the atmosphere generator for the evening. You got about a half hour to get in before breathing does become a bitch. Thank you. - While you guys was working so hard, I was creating for your culinary delight, I present pan divion avec palm d'terre. - Actually it's pan divion avec palm d'terre puree. - That's what I said, man. - Hey, man, I'm not a big fan of foreign food. What is it? - Meatloaf and mashed potatoes. - Oh, man. - Come on. - [Banton] All right, come on, dig in. Get it, get it while is hot. Don't complain, I put a lot of work in this. - A spoon. Thank you. - You want one? - Yes. - [Man] Whoa, whoa. - [Banton] Come on ladies, don't look like that. I put a lot of work into that. (processor whirs) (monster gurgles) (processor beeps) (flesh crunching) (eerie music) (flesh crunching) (monster growls) - [Man] How hard can it be to like throw a glove around? - And the grand total is 340 pounds of platinum. - All right. - Not bad. - We'll divide the hull at the end of the operation. Now, unfortunately, back to business. All right, last shift, alpha crew. Cody, Banton, 160 yards. Beta crew, Luke, Archer, 140. Better watch your back, Cody, little brother's catching up. - Yeah, the sooner we get done with this job, the sooner we get off this stinkin' platform. - [Ryan] Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? - You're damn right I would. - Good. As of tomorrow, alpha crew will move to an extra hour per shift. That ought to help you get off this stinkin' platform a little sooner. And I'm sure Dr. Shaw will appreciate your dedication. - Oh, nice going, Cody. That's a 10-hour shift, man. Like I don't spend enough time in that room already. - Give me a break, Banton. What else do you have to do besides sleeping and jerking off? And don't talk to me about 10-hour shifts, pal. I'm carrying the drill. - [Ryan] Calm down, girls. - We want off this stinkin' rock, too. - Brotherly solidarity. Well, Luke, my friend, your wish is my command. 10-hour shifts all around. - Okay, you need to place your charges around the perimeter of the reactor at approximately this height and the confinement of the tunnel walls will concentrate the power of the explosion, generating enough kinetic energy to alter this moon's course. - You sure about that? - Yeah, it should miss the earth by about 75,000 miles. - 75,000 miles. Well, that's a pretty safe miss. - Hardly. You see, the problem's one of scale. If Galileo's Child passes too close to the earth, the effects will be catastrophic. - Wait, wait, wait. What exactly do you mean by catastrophic? - Okay, the same way a speed boat creates a wake through water, the moon's path creates a wake through space. We call it gravitational displacement. Any closer and it will cause tidal waves, volcanic eruptions, shifts in the polarized faults- - Okay, okay, you make your point, Doc. Do the rest of the crew know about this? - Would it make a difference? - What about Ryan and his theories? - Well, I wouldn't dignify Ryan's greed with the word theories. I mean, even in the face of global disaster, all he sees is that someone's trying to make a buck. - All Ryan can see is money. All I can see is faces. My mother, father, brothers and friends. - It's not over yet, Nuke-em. We still have time. - Samantha. Samantha. Nuke-em thing's just something to keep the jocks at bay. - What do you mean? - As Samantha Rogers, I'm just a woman. Another easy target. Nuke-em gives me shield. She commands respect. Sometimes being her is the only thing that gets me through the day. - We still have time. Trust me. - [Ryan] Where you headed? - Headed to check on the atmosphere generator. We've been pushing it way too hard, working all these extra hours. We gotta shut it down a couple shifts or we're gonna kill it. - No, no, no, no, we don't shut it down. We overhaul the system. - What? - What's hard to understand about that Potter? Overhaul it. (door slams) - Overhaul the system, Potter. Blaster ain't gonna do dick. (eerie music) (monster growls) (Potter groans) Screw this. Automatic set up. (buttons beep) 6 a.m. (door slams) - It is entirely too early for this. - I'll go cut the drill. Should be ready in about 10 minutes. - 10 hours and nobody to play Battlescarz with. - I didn't even hear it Banton, now get in the control room. (door slams) - Good morning. Oh, I guess the photos weren't enough. She done gone for the bones. She's all yours. Stripped to clean. - Hey, Banton, you there? - Yeah, where else would I be? How we doing? - Listen, I'm ready here. Could you fire up the drill head? - Will do. Starting on three, two, one. (drill whirs) - Another day of fun and frolic. - Cody. - [Cody] Talk to me. - Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday. - Man, don't worry about it. You just keep it loud and I am digging proud. - You got it. (heavy rock music) (Cody coughs) What the hell is? (Cody coughs) - Cody, hang up the drill and get in here right away. The generator's down. - Now you tell me (coughs). It's like breathing turb out here. (alarm blares) - God, I can't believe this man. I had no money in this equipment. (men speaking indistinctly) - All right, everybody, heads up. Here's the deal. Until repairs are completed, we're gonna be tunneling the old fashioned way with atmosphere masks. - Great. Goldfish bowl time. - I don't wanna hear it. We got a schedule to keep and we're gonna stay on it. I got Banton working on the generator, so, Archer, I need you covering Cody in the control room. - That's a double shift. - That's right. - [Shaw] How will this affect our timetable? - It won't. Once you guys are used to wearing the masks, we'll be fine. (heavy metal music) (dramatic music) - Give me that thing. All right, Ben, get to work on that exhaust line. Move the couplings, the ware and rack and everything. I'm gonna be walking up and down this tunnel picking up parts. Get on with it. - Will do. What have we got here? Ah. All right, there we go, okay. Oh, man, this thing looks fried. - Fused master board, huh? Might as well replace the whole thing. You okay with that? - Yeah, sure, it's no problem. - I'm gonna go check on the core. - Okay, one hour to go. You're up to 170 yards in nine hours. Maybe we shouldn't tell Ryan. He may never get the generator fixed. He'll have you wearing an atmosphere mask all the time. - One hour to go, huh? Why don't you speed her up 20%. Bring out the disc. - The disc? - Fire it up, Archer! (heavy metal music) - Ah. - Ah, ha, ha, ha! (dramatic music) - Okay, all right, yeah. (dramatic music) Hey, Potter, the exhaust is replaced. I'm about ready for some food. How's it going in there? Potter, you're leaking core coolant all over the ground. What's going on? You taking a nap in there or what? Ah, ah, ah! (monster growls) (Banton screams) (body thuds) (Banton gasps) (heavy metal music) - Hey, shut her down, Archer. - All right. (monster growls) (camera whirs) - Meatloaf and mashed potatoes, sorry. So what's the deal with the generator? - I would assume since they're not here that Banton and Potter are still working on it, right? - Guess word of Potter's favorite has filtered its way to the back of the platform. (monster growls) - Got your snapshots developed, let's have a look. - I hope your hands are clean. - Picture may be worth a thousand words, but to own the object of one's desire like your little fossilized friend here. That can be worth more than words, huh? - I'd love to sit here and chat with you, but I was just leaving and you're in my way. - Oh, you're a tough nut to crack, aren't you, Doc? You know what? We don't have to be on opposite sides here. We're not that different when you come right down to it. We each have our passions. And the fact that you're a woman and I'm a man. That doesn't have to be such a bad difference if you think about it. - I don't wanna think about it. - Got something to say? - Nothing you'd wanna hear. - Why don't you let me be the judge of that. - Yeah, and go on 11-hour shifts? No thanks. - Off the record. - Off the record. I think you're out of your depth. I mean, one minute you're striking at her like a rattlesnake. The next you're trying to stick your tongue down her throat. She doesn't like you. I don't think anybody likes you. - It's a good thing it doesn't matter what the hell you think. 'Cause you're just a grunt, right? And all you'll ever be is a grunt. You have a shot, but you screwed it up, so you'll probably be carrying that drill till the day you die. Chances are I'll be watching. Back on record. Now go clean up. (whimsical orchestral music) - And time for morning lesson, Mr. Honor Student. - I'm ready when you are. - Okay, you have a cooling reading of 35%. In the face, you're showing signs of carbon residue. - What's my drill speed? - [Archer] 16,000 rems per minute with a barker in key drill. - Check my scan for density. Open up the magna jets and increase to 20,000 rems. - Good, and? - Switch on the CO2 heads in case of friction emission. - Excellent, now what's the safety spec on using compound drill heads. - What, what? - Come on, you know this. (Luke screams) - Oh, my God. (alarm blares) - What the hell is going on? - [Archer] It got him. - Wait a minute, wait a minute what's got who? - Some kind of animal. At the face, it's got Luke. (monster growls) (dramatic music) (gun blasts) - Kill the drill, Archer. Christ almighty. No penetration, not a single bullet. It ricocheted right off him. - [Ryan] What the hell is this thing? (monster growls) - Count off. (dramatic music) (monster growls) - Get inside. Be my guest. (dramatic music) (Ryan exhales) - There's no sign of them on any of the monitors. - We should have heard from him by now. I think we should assume it got Potter and Banton. - And Ryan? - Definitely Ryan. - Seven years I've been working on platforms. Nothing like this has ever happened. I mean that thing had to be at least 8 feet tall and it's teeth were like- - I know, I got a really good look at it. - I don't get it. When we scanned this rock there was no sign of indigenous life. That thing shouldn't be here. - You wanna go outside and tell it that, Archer? - Animal life. Hell, this thing looked like an animal, but it didn't move like one. I mean, it moved like a- - Like a man. - Yeah. - [Shaw] What about it's skin? - Well, it looked like worn leather, but it had these- - Boney plates connected to its skeleton. - You know for somebody that wasn't there, you sure seem to know an awful lot about this thing. - You wanna tell us what this thing is. - So let me get this straight. That thing running around out there, that's the dried out old bones from the chamber? - Well, the creature that you described to me has the same characteristics, I just, well, I didn't make the connection until right now. - What connection? - Something Ryan said to me. I think he thought that I took the fossil from the chamber. - Come on, that was just bones. I mean, it was dead. - Well, it's alive now. - Maybe, maybe it was a tomb and we desecrated it. You know, like in "The Mummy." - Oh, my God. - Oh, now, maybe he's right. We altered something in there. That creature must have been hibernating and we went in there and we changed the atmosphere, the pressure and we woke it up. - Well, if that was the case, then we would have seen it. I mean, we were in that chamber for what, an hour and a half. - Yeah, but when we broke in there we flooded it with oxygen. And it obviously didn't regenerate itself till after the processor shut down, so it thrives in a nitrogen-based atmosphere. - Nitrogen. - Okay, great, so now what do we do? - Repair the generator, bring back the oxygen. - There are three people that can fix that generator. Potter, Banton and Ryan. They're dead. (monster bangs) - Come on, maybe we can see from control. - [Archer] What is it doing? It knows we're in here. - We gotta kill this thing. - Kill it? I'll blow the shit out of it. - What have you got? - Compression charges, molecule charges, shape charges, primer cord, toluene discs, a butt load of plastic, radio dets, vibration dets, mercury switches, temperature switches and a little cocktail of my own concoction, guaranteed to cause utter devastation. It's an encased nitrogen reacting plastic. You got about 10 seconds after its fired and opened and then adios muchachos. - How accurate is it? - If you get that thing to stand still long enough, I can shoot if from about 40 feet. - That's too close. One miss and you're dog meat. - Then I won't miss and you're gonna have to keep him occupied. I'll go prep and load up. - Looks like we're going fishing. - The question is which one of us is gonna be the bait? - Hey, Archer, what are you doing back there? I can't believe that guy's hungry. - You know, maybe he's got the right idea. We're gonna need the energy. Archer, whatever you're fixing, make enough for everyone. So what are we gonna use for protection? - I got Nuke-em's drill gun. - I'm set. What's going on in here? - Ooh. (extinguisher blasts) Sorry, you guys. - Nice going. - What exactly's in that? - It was a Spanish omelet, mushrooms, onions. - No, no, what's in the extinguisher, Nuke-em? - Ammonium phosphate base, carbon dioxide propellant. - There's your protection. - A fire extinguisher? - Our friend breathes nitrogen. It can't breathe the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. - Choke it on- - [Together] CO2. - [Luke] Are you sure about this, Doc? - Of course she's sure. - Well, then why don't you be the bait? - That's not exactly what I meant. - I'll do it. - Yeah? - I always like fishing anyway. - Hey, what's this? I didn't know you were into computers. - I'm not. - Well, this is program code. It ain't what you'd call user friendly, but it's definitely a primitive form of digital binary code. Where'd you get this? - I copied it from the walls of the chamber. - Okay, and now we run this through a descrambler. It might be a little hit and miss, some of the codes were different. The descrambler will re-sort the data and recode it into readable text. Here we go. - Oh, wow. Maybe this'll let us know a little bit more about our friend out there. - Archer? - You don't wanna know. The inscription is both tribute and a warning from the people who caught and trapped that thing outside. They called it vortous. To them it was an angel of death. The last survivor of an ancient species or just some terrible freak of nature. They didn't know. All they knew was what it did. - What did it do? - Harvest them. Roaming their world like a plague on legs, killing them, burying them. - Burying them? - What the hell for? - To let them ripen. - It's a carrionator. - A what? - It feeds only on dead, rotting flesh. - Great. - Oh, it gets better. - It would return to its killing grounds and feed on the decaying corpses. - [Luke] Well, how did it get stuck in the box? - A trap. - Trap. - They built it with their strongest and most valuable resources, platinum and vanadium. Oh, then baited it. - Oh, God. - 10 volunteers, they took their own lives and their corpses were placed in the room. The creature, attracted by the stench of rotting flesh was lured inside and trapped. Then the chamber was jettisoned into space. - Floating through space for millions of years. And then after time, pieces of rock would adhere to it surface. - So Galileo's Child isn't really a moon. It's more a sort of floating Alcatraz. - We gave this thing parole. - Yeah, well, now it's time to give it the chair. (dramatic music) - Hey, Archer, do you see anything out there? - It's all pretty quiet. - Go ahead. All right, Luke, it's all yours. Later big brother. - Get outta here. - Archer, anything? - Nothing here. - I don't know about you guys, but I'm freezing. (dramatic music) (monster growls) - Luke! - Luke, use the CO2! - Blast it. (monster growls) - Get outta here! - What about you? - Get the fire! - Stay down. Come on, Cody. - I can't. - Cody, come on. - Fire! Fire now! (fire blasts) - You missed. - No, I didn't. Hit the deck. (fire blast) - You guys okay? - Yeah. - Yes. - I'm gonna go check out the damage. - Hey, give me a hand with this thing, Luke, huh? - Yeah, sure. (dramatic music) (monster growls) (Samantha moans) Stay here. (monster growls) (dramatic music) - Cody, get up, get up, come on. Come on. - [Archer] Where's Nuke-em? - He got her, she's dead. - Come on, Cody. Come on. - You're going down. - Cody. (monster growls) (Cody moans) - I, I gotta find Luke. (dramatic music) - This one's for Nuke-em. - I gotta see Luke. - No, no. - I gotta see Luke. (monster growls) (somber music) - [Archer] I vote we get the hell off this rock now. - [Shaw] We can't go anywhere until we're finished. This isn't just about us. - What happens if we set the charges and leave now? - I don't know. Two tunnels may be enough. I need time to figure out a new trajectory. - We don't have time. If I was to show you how to set those charges, would you be able to place them? - Yeah. - All right. And, uh, you do that and then you and I are gonna go out and prep that rover. I just gotta check the light systems and the battery. - Go outside? - Archer, don't get flaky on me now. I need you to watch my back. - It's dark in here. - Listen, Archer, any sign of that creature you blast it with the CO2 and we get our asses back in here. - I wasn't gonna ask it to dance. - All right? - Let's go. - Let's go, I'm behind you. - 64. Set detonator. - Oh, my God. - Sorry. (dramatic music) - It was Ryan. - But he's dead. - Obviously not that dead. - Dr. Shaw. Dr. Shaw, are you there? - Yeah, I'm here. - Can you check the containment bay, please? - Yeah, tell me where it is and I will. - [Cody] It's directly to your right. It's marked Sea Bay OR. - Okay, give me a sec. Uh, gray door, yellow writing. - That's it. - It's empty. - Shit. - What's the problem? - Platinum's gone, so's the rover. Ryan's not dead. He sold us out and he made a run for it. Meet and debrief in five minutes. - I'm there. - Cody, take a look. (dramatic music) - Looks like old Ryan didn't make it too far. (engine stalls) Archer, why don't you move over to the driver's side over there and work the ignition when I tell you. I just gotta fix this connection down here. Come on. (engine revs) We got it. We're outta here. (monster growls) Archer! Come on! - Screw you! You didn't think I was gonna leave you, did you? - We found the rover. - Where's Archer, he's dead, isn't he? - Hell, no, he's right behind me. I'm surprised he can walk with balls that big. - Then let's get the hell outta here. - It's not good. Ryan tried. He didn't get 200 yards. - Look, if it's any help, I've figured out that what we've tunneled will be enough. - At least that's one worry off our backs. - As long as we detonate within two hours. - You gotta be kidding me. - Look, with the reduction in volume, we've got not choice. - Any idea how we're gonna do this? - Yeah. We got one more thing that can kill this bastard. - Drill head. - Right. We get that thing against the face, we can drill right through it. How we doing on CO2? - Two extinguishers. - Shit. That's not enough. - But if we can get it to the face, we can keep it there with the cooling jets from the drill head. They're carbon dioxide. All we need to do is direct them out. - All right. You run the drill from control. I'll maneuver the arm outside. - Question is how do we get all the ugly to the face within the next two hours? - Listen, this thing's smart, but it's not killing us for fun. It's an animal. It's territorial and it goes where the feeding's good. If we're out there, it'll show. - Then let's go. - Cody, how long you got? - About another five minutes, you? - I'm going visual now. Cody, we got a visitor. - I'm not ready! Where exactly is it? - Back of the platform, left side near the atmosphere generator, moving along the wall. - You tell me the second it passes that generator. Dr. Shaw! Archer, Archer, can you see Dana? - What? Geez, she's heading straight towards it. (Dana screams) (Cody coughs) - God. Sorry, Cody. - It was my fault, my fault. - I thought you were the... - It's okay. Let's get back to the drill face. (monster growls) Archer? We're expecting company buddy. Fire up the drill head and turn on the exterior lights. (dramatic music) (monster growls) Go! Dana, take the drill. (dramatic music) Come on, get it. - You have to get it right in front of the drill. - Get over! Come on! Come on. Archer, now! - Wait, Cody, get out of there. - We have to drill it closer. We have to get it closer. That's close enough. That's close enough! - I didn't do anything. - You thought it was all over between us, didn't you, Doc? Huh, well, guess again. Come on, Cody. (monster growls) (slap strikes) (punch strikes) Big man, huh? - Cody! (monster growls) (punch strikes) (Ryan groans) - That's 100% full drill speed, now gut the bastard! Son of a bitch! (monster groaning) (fast rock music) - Oh, man. Let's go home. God, I hope this thing gets us to the surface. - It better. We've got 45 minutes till detonation. - Come on! Let's move it! (triumphant music) - Shutting down in five, four, three, two one. There's Galileo's child. We can monitor its changing trajectory from here hopefully. (monitor beeps) - This is your baby. - This one's for Mother Earth. (dramatic music) (monitor beeps) (rock explodes) (monitor beeps) - It's altering course. - You did it. - No, we did it. We all did it. (gentle music) - Since we're gonna stuck up here till help arrives, either of you two know how to play Battlescarz? - No, but I have a feeling we will.
