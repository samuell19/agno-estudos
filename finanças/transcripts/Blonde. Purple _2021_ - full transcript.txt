To go to jail together! We didn't land on Plymouth Rock. The rock landed on us. Drugs are menacing our society. Just say no. I can't breath! What, what, what, what, what now? What, what, what now? What now, what now, what now, what now? What now? What now? What now, what now, fuck? What now, what now, what now, what now? What, what, what? Why, why, why, why did they do that? Why, why, why did they? Why, why, why did they? Why, why, why did they? Why did they fuckin' do that? What, why? What now? What now, why? What now? Ah shit, he picked up. Hey, you're still alive, I guess. Why did you fucking do it? - Why? - All right listen, calm down. - I wanna tell you something. - Don't you know anything about negotiating with a hostile fuckin' person? - Shut the fuck up. - You never tell them - to fuckin' calm down. - You done yet? - You're, you're, you're. - I'm trying to tell - you something here. - You're meant to deescalate the situation. Let 'em vent, let 'em get all the rage - off his fuckin' chest. - Listen, Jesus! You fuckin', ain't my fault! None of this is my fault! Are you done? You still there? Hello? How did you get my number? Your buddy Quint gave it to me. You fuckin' shot him. You fuckin' killed him. He didn't do nothing, you fuckin' killed him. He was, he just, you fuckin', you fuckin', fuck. Kid went for his gun, what do you want? He went for his gun? Yes, he went for his fuckin' gun. Liar, fuckin' liar. Listen, listen, shut up. I need you to be quiet for a second. - I need you to just listen. - What? Do you hear that? No. You don't hear that? You don't hear sirens? - What, I don't. - Do you hear them or not? - Fuck this, so what? - Those sirens are on your 12 and your six and your three and your nine - And if you don't what. - What the fuck are - you talking about? - That fuckin' means, it means you are surrounded Junior. So as you can plainly see, it does not matter if I choose to deescalate the situation, or if I choose to escalate the situation or if I choose to fuck your mother and cum right on her ugly face, I have the high ground and that means your ass is mine. So why don't you walk on out the front door, drop your pants around your ankles, bend over and then beg me real nice to use a little lube? - I got nothing to lose. - What? I said I ain't got nothing to lose. Except for your life. If that's worth anything. Listen, go ahead and tell me your name. Fuck you. That's my name. Okay, well listen Mr. Fuck You. Mr. You, Fuck's my Christian name. Ah, that's funny as shit. You're a funny motherfucker. That's the, ah shit, you just made my day. I'm going to tell you a little secret. Your friend, the one that got shot out there, he was an asshole. I mean, it doesn't matter how well-spoken he is. He bored the living shit out of all of us with all of his demands, this, that and the other. He came here, you both came here thinking what? You were going to find a yachts, private jets, stacks of cash, 72 virgins. What did you think happened when we got to now? Have you ever seen any movies? The good guys, which is me, we always lie to you and the bad guys, which is you, you always end up caught or dead. - Fuck you. - I don't give a fuck which. Hey Mr. You? I think this fuckin' kid just threw me across the room. Hey, I got something you're going to want to hear. Come here, I got a little secret for you. Your friend, the asshole, he's still alive. That's right. Well, I mean, probably only barely, you get shot that many times you don't have real good odds, but for right now he is a regular Curtis 50 cent jack. You can meet him in the club. That's where it's going down. - Where is he? - He's in a hospital, you dumb shit. They're trying to keep him alive right now. And I promise you, if you come out right now, I will take you to go see him. We'll even ride together. I will sit in the back fuckin' seat and hold your hand. And if you talk real nice to me. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic. Hello? Lisa? Yeah? He's been shot. - I told you guys not to do it. - Hold up. I need you to get your ass on the phone and call local hospitals. Find out if he's, if he's alive or not. - You can't do that? - I called 'em already but it went straight to voicemail. You called him? Of course it went to voicemail, he's shot, you saw. Who you callin' next, God? Will you do this one small fuckin' thing for me, please? He's your fuckin' friend. Fine. Hey wait a minute, how is he shot and you're fine? That don't. Are you a cop? No, I'm not a fuckin' cop. What the fuck are you talkin' about? What, why the fuck would I fuckin' be calling you? - All right, all right. - Talk sense, god damn. I gotta fuckin' ask, what the hell? Did you at least get the money? Are you kidding me? What? You went in there to get the money, now did you get any fuckin' money? Or has the whole thing been a waste of everyone's time. - Make the fuckin' call. - Fuck you. Call me back asap, all right, bye bye. - Bye. - Bye, bye. Why are you still here? When you ran back in, you dragged me with you. - I did? - Yeah. You dragged me by the hair. So what? It hurt. You're alive, be grateful. You don't remember me, do you? From before all of this? Anyway, your friend, he's definitely alive. Saw his face when he hit the floor. He was in pain, but alive. I felt helpless. Helpless? You are helpless. What are you, 12? - I'm 16. - What's a 16 year old doing in a bank? You gonna let me go? I promise I won't tell the police your real name. You don't know my name. Yeah, you're right, I don't. How do you know my name? I don't. Don't lie to me. I just made that up. You said you knew my name, tell me how. I don't know anything, I promise. Yeah? He's alive. You 100% sure. Yes, but it's not looking good. Listen, I need a way out of this. Out of? The bank. What else? Why don't you call God back? - What? - Listen, I can't help you. I just saw on the news. You're surrounded, you're fucked. You gave me your number. You said you fixed shit, Lisa. You said anything go wrong, call me. Okay, let me just come down there and dig you a tunnel. Can you at least go to the fuckin' hospital to see if he pulls through? Fuck no, fuck no. Come on. You crazy? - Fuck no. - Please. - I want my cut. - A cut of zero? - Bye Felicia. - Hold up! If I make it out of this, there may be some loot involved. That's a big fuckin' if. I got a hostage. A girl. Really? I want 10 percent. For going to the hospital? Damn right. - Fuck that. - Okay, bye! Hold up. Fine. How are you going to pay her with no money? What? I've got money. No, you left the money outside when you dragged me in here. I mean you could always rob the bank again. I think I see some money on the floor inside that area over there. But if you leave this office, they might shoot you. I think they got snipers out there too. You gonna kill me? That's his blood, not yours. Stop? Oh fuck, fuck, why'd they fuckin' do that? Mr. You, hey bud, listen, I gotta apologise. I was a little rough on you earlier. And I got this toxic masculine something that my therapist is on about. Wife says I'm just too fuckin' aggressive, but you wanna know the bullshit? My daughter, she fuckin' loves it. Are you kiddin'? She goes out to the playground, she's like, don't mess with me, my dad will go God mode on you. The best, you got kids, man? Or wait no, I guess you probably don't. You're too young, right? What are you, like 25, 26, 28? Something like that? I spent all day talking to your god damn friend. I don't know you yet. I mean, that guy was, you know, I was about to say I liked him, but I don't know why I would say that, I fuckin' hated him. He was an asshole. Anybody who kidnaps 12 people is an asshole, all right? But I want us to get to know each other asshole. I am Aaron. I am your crisis negotiator. I'm not like those guys out there that shot your friend. They spend all day holding a gun. They get all itchy. They want to shoot something and then go home and fuck their wives missionary style. I am the talker. I'm the one who's your friend here, okay? I'm not your friend. Sorry, what was that? I said I'm not your friend. All right, fair, you know what? That's still progress, we're communicating now. All right, so how old are you? C'mon man, this is not communicating. You're not answering me. You got to give me something. What's your favourite colour? What's your favourite day of the week? Do you like a reach around in the shower? The fuck? You know, I don't have time for this. You got 10 minutes. You got fuckin' 10 minutes before I sick these god damn wild animals in there and they shoot you dead, just like your fuckin' friend. - So end this shit. - If he dies, I'm gonna kill her. We can go home. Her? What do you mean her? What her are you talkin' about here, bud? Is there a girl in there with you? Nah, that can't be right, we did a headcount. Will you answer my fuckin' question? How old is your daughter? She's 14. Girl in here ain't much older. If he dies, I'm going to kill her. Why'd you always leave? All things come to an end. Right. You sad? No. Don't look at my ass when I get my clothes. What's up with the picture? That is a '70 to '75 BMW CSL. Launched the M brand, vintage. Set you back 135K. I'm saving up, gonna get one. How's that going for you, considering you just got fired? How do you get sacked from a fuckin' car garage? I had that job for you. Asshole called me stupid, I don't. Calm down. I've got a couple G's saved. Oh, only another 133,000 to go. You know, you're in violation of your parole right? Cause I'm fuckin' you? Because you have no job. Can't you just pretend that I do have a job? - I know a guy. - A guy? A guy, needs a fourth man. Collection? Collection. What collection job needs four men? Robbery. Never done a robbery before. What's the difference? Petty crime, segway. May as well elevate yourself. Niv Clock, him and his crew have done about 14 stickups, he's slick. 10 years ago, he knocks off a jewellers, takes home 500+, no trace. Then he got caught on some small charges, they made an example out of him. Gave him four, he's a little bit jaded now maybe. Lost his spark a little. But he's all to the good. All right. You, this is, this is a big jump. I mean, robbery. We even get you enough to score that. When I get it, maybe we go someplace, just drive. Like in the movies? Like in the movies, yeah. I'm your fuckin' parole officer, we're just fucking. Take your mum somewhere nice with the money. She died when I was three. Awkward. That brought the mood down and for that, I'm very sorry. Don't be late to the meeting. He's got a thing about punctuality. Madison. That's my name. So when you kill me, you killed Madison. If. You're gonna kill me, I can tell. You want something to take everything out on and I'm right in front of you. So when do I get Stockholm syndrome? What? - You know, Stockholm syndrome, it's where the hostage. - I know what it is. Shut up a minute. I'm trying to think. He went for his gun. Liars, they're fuckin' liars. I got temper problem, then why the fuck you in the fuckin' job for? Wrong profession for a fuckin' temper problem. He did. - What? - Nothing. Are you talking about the gun? He didn't go for his fuckin' gun. He reached into his jacket. So, so what? You, you don't just kill a guy. You don't. That's not how life works. Yeah, totally. No, black lives matter and all that. What? I'm hungry. We could order pizza. You know, I bet you're a pineapple on your pizza kind of guy, right? Hello? Yes, I'd like to order a few pizzas please. Yeah, deliver it to the hostage situation. Yes, you know the bank thing. Yeah, so I'll take the vegetable delight. Yeah and my man here, yeah, he'll take extra pineapple on his meaty paradise. Yes, that's right. Plenty of pineapple. Yeah, that's the one. 30 minutes or it's free, right? Great. Who hangs up the phone like that anymore? - Are you even old enough to hang up the phone like that? - Do you ever shut up? You asked me what I was doing here and I don't even know. I don't even care. You see, I came here to, well I'm a singer. I'm actually kinda famous, I released a couple of singles last year. Nothing since though. My dad opened up an account here where he keeps all my money. Fact is I don't like him and he has all my money. So I wanted to see if I could get it back and run away. I don't care, I don't care! - And all of a sudden. - I don't care! Blazing guns. They wouldn't have given you the money. It's your dad's account. Maybe, guess we'll never know. What do you? What he do to you do? Hm, thought you didn't care. I'm being polite. I don't want to talk about it. - He rape you? - No. I need to go to the bathroom. It's just over there. I can alone, I won't run. I won't be long, I'm just gonna. Fine, fine, go! Hurry up. Yeah, I will. Got me waiting in here like a motherfucka. Sorry man. Saida told me you was reliable. I am reliable. Then why you late? It's not my fault. See, let me ask you something. - Sure. - Why you want - to do this shit? - What? - Nigga, you deaf? - No. - So you heard me? - Yeah. To get rich. Nigga, is that a question? I guess I phrased it like one. Listen, if you don't know why you doing this shit, then you need to get the fuck out the car. You still here. I thought I told you to get the fuck out the car. You see those tower blocks over there? Barely, too comfortable in this position to look. Last week a girl about 20 or something got raped in the elevator. Police came by, asked a couple of questions to a couple people then left. No follow ups, no further inquiries. They knew people weren't finna talk. Now other weeks, some cop didn't stick to the script. Choked the boy so hard, his windpipe broke, died instantly. Don't get me wrong. The kid was a street rat, but he didn't deserve to die. There were some protests, some backlash, but as usual, it don't do shit. And I'm sitting here staring at those same tower blocks, same shit. And I wanna stay and help fix it. Really, I do. I did. Man, all I really want is to buy a '70 to '75 BMW CSL 3.0 and drive the fuck away from here forever. Well, god damn, you a deep talking motherfucker, huh? Got Malcolm X up in this bitch. - We good? - That seemed rehearse. - You a cop? - No. Kind of work you done before? Call centre, mechanic. - No nigga, work. - Not much. I didn't ask how much, I asked what kind. You gon' have to get smart. I am smart. Then answer the question. A bit of fraud, shoplifting, collection, nothing heavy, man. I did a six month stint, got caught. Ever killed a man? - No. - Ever killed a woman? - No. - Nigga, you a cop? No, I'm not a fuckin' cop, all right? That's twice I asked. - Saida your PO? - Yep. She was mine previous. She nice, right? Yep. That was an uncanny yeah. You fuckin' her? - No. - Liar. You got a girl, kids? I'm a career car, career first, you? No man, I was an orphan, ain't got no kids of my own. How was your time inside? Was it a nice time, six months, right? Easy. Kept my head down. Made zero friends, made zero enemies. Six months, that's a kindergarten stick. You seen that film, Straight Time? Dustin Hoffman? Yeah. I love that scene when he hits his parole officer in the car. Look at me sucker, you busted me for nothing! I love that, man. That's all I did as a kid, man, watch movies. My dad, he made me watch Robocop. It'll toughen you up. Look at me now. Hate cops. I watched that shit about 400 times. I buy that shit for a dollar. Classic, man. Listen here, I'm gon' have to be your Fagin since you're a rook. Four things you need for the art of the steal. The set up, where you gon' hit or what. Swell mob, two to four, no more. Guns, loaded or blanks, doesn't matter. People see guns, they automatically think death, makes 'em placid. The getaway call, in, out, no fuckin' around. You fuck around, you either going to the big house or gettin' lit up. Right. And don't believe them films you see neither. All right, it's not about the job. It's about the getaway. Most yardbirds say, 98% actually robbed the bank itself. The getaway, though. You got a gun? You gon' need a gun. Where am I going to get a gun? Why don't you ask that parole officer you ain't fuckin? She'll hook us up. She got a beak in all the oceans. I'd normally ask my girl, Lisa. Her normal connect's doin' time. Yo girl? It's an expression, told you, career first. What you know about Saida, like, really though? Not much, she's my PO, that's it. I heard she killed a young kid, about 11. Bullshit. In this industry, you gotta make a name for yourself. Kid was pedalling merchandise for her. She found out he was keep. Shot him dead. Got herself a rep, no one fucks with her. For real? Would you kill a kid? If I got gotta. Little free advice, this shit in the bank goes wrong, you're probably gon' have to kill somebody to get out. Security guard, woman, maybe even a kid. Don't flinch. So you're fuckin' her, right? The midnight special. This place is open at midnight? 24 hours. Pancakes and waffles, sounds good. Here, them bonafide thick pancakes too, not that thin French shit. Only untoward thing about this garbage joint is the service. Can't never get a waiter. I normally walk out without payin'. Normally? Like more than once? I come back every time and they don't even realise. Ever exited a place without payin' before? No. Well? What? Now? You wanna be a thief, Oliver Twist? I'm going. Oh, come on man. Hey there, Mr. You, it is Aaron, your friendly hostage negotiator. And I just learned that you do in fact have a girl in there. She is a young singer and as such, I am authorised to offer you a cosy two years sentence. - No, no, no. - Two year deal if you just - walk out. - Fuck that! Don't try and negotiate with me now, man. What happened to bustin' in here and killin' me, huh? Curtis Jackson my way out of here. Well, I have a temper, I told you that too. Well maybe you're in the wrong fuckin' profession. Yeah, maybe I am, but I'm the best option you got and I'm pretty fuckin' good. - Pretty good? - Yes. You're about to be responsible for the death of a teenage girl, you okay with that? Hey you listen, I have been doing this for 12 years and I have never lost a hostage on my watch. I have a record to protect. Looks to me like your record's fucked. Is that why you came down here? - Shut the fuck up! - Is that why you came down here? Did you come here to be a murderer? I thought you came here to rob a bank, come on. Do you really want to kill a little girl, huh? Do you want that on your conscience? Is that why you came here today? Jesus Christ, like talkin' to my fuckin' wife. - '70 to '75 BMW CSL 3.0. - What? That's what I want, waiting for me outside and I don't want anyone within two miles of the bank. Two miles isn't possible. - Two miles! - Two miles is impossible. The car waiting for me there, I'll leave the girl, get in and drive off and that's a what do they call that? Non-negotiable. Okay, all right. But I'm going to need proof of life. I need to hear her voice. If you're going to leave the girl, I need to know she's alive. Can you do that for me? Can you? Yeah, yeah I have? What the fuck? Who was that you were talking to? - No one. - Who was that? I wasn't talking to anyone! Ah stop, you're hurting me! Let go of me, let go! Is that, is that her? Hey, wait, what's going on in there? What's on the other, can you hear me? Can you hear me? God damn it. Whoa, whoa, wait a fuckin' second. You're gonna tell me that Nic Cage prime is better than Johnny Depp in his prime? Fuck yeah. No fuckin' way. Edward Scissorhands, Fear and Loathing, Dead Man, fuckin' Ed Wood, Ed Wood motherfucker. How are you gonna tell me Nicholas Cage beats any of those fuckin' movies? Back me up man. I fuckin' can't. So wait, you don't fuck with Leaving Las Vegas? - No. - You don't fuck with Face-Off? You don't with some Bad Lieutenant? What the fuck are you talking about? You're talking about two different fuckin' things here. How is that even the same thing? It's chalk and cheese. - What? - I come to you with prime, prime fuckin' rib and I say to you, show me what you got and what do you do? You bring me fuckin' fast food. You show me fuckin' burgers, man. Fries, fuckin' milkshake. What the fuck is he talking about? Wait, Nath, back me up, Nath, back me the fuck up, come on. - I mean. - Come on. I fuck with some Nic Cage. Dude, thank you. For sure, he talented. Get the fuck outta here, talented? What the fuck are you? However, however, I must contest with you Stally, and I show you fair favour for it. He indeed, humbly served your platter, some steak and yo ass, ungrateful repost delivered this nigga chicken nuggets and mozzarella dips and all kind of shit. Now, if you going to go Nick Cage, and may I add so fuckin' boldly, go Raisin' Arizona, go Lord of War. Shit even go Joe, you go Leavin' Las Vegas. Well fuckin' done. But by the law of Hades, how the fuck you gonna go Face Off? - No, no, no, no. - Well fuck you sir. Face Off is a classic film. You know what, fuck both of you. It's not even a film. Okay, so then what the fuck is it? A telenovela? There's a distinct difference between a movie and a film. What? See even the fuckin' new guy's chimin' in. Yeah, you ask him. What the fuck are you talking about? Name me the best films ever, go. - Shawshank. - Godfather. - Scarface. - Scarface? New guy's fuckin' killin' me over here, I'm agreeing though, Scarface. I mean, seriously, seriously. Get the fuck out. There's the door, go on. We'll forget that one, all right? Yeah, all right. I mean, Fred here, seems like things a little less than perfect. You know? I mean his girl. What you gonna do about it, Fred? All right, move the fuck on, now, quickly. Finish your fuckin' film movie nonsense. Yes, professor. Why don't you talk? Hey, he given you one of his rousing fuckin' speeches yet? No, you're gonna fuckin' love this. Marcus Anthony and Caesar's funeral every fuckin' time. Go ahead. Friends, niggas, countrymen. Lend me your motherfucking ears. The best films ever, Shawshank, Godfather, Scarface. Thank you! They all have something in common. Anyone? Realism. They're all settled in a measure of realism. Now, of course, there are some peculiarities to these rules, Pulp Fiction borderline being a movie. It's very referential. And the thing, that, seriously, almost fucking tips it, Mia Wallace 'don't be a square' scene, oh my god. I love that scene. Near fourth wall-breaking and spends too much time tryna' be French New Wave. Now Star Wars, Harry fucking Potter, movies. Back to the Future, other such relatedness. Now personally, I prefer film. If I had to walk around in a movie world all my life, well, I'd rather die. Now my heart is in the coffin there with truth. And I must wait until it returns to me. So basically, sci-fi ain't film? Is that what this nigga got from what I just said? Oh my days, for the welfare of lucidity, sci-fi can be film. Perfect example, Twelve Monkeys. I'm fuckin' confused. Oh my God. - No I'm gettin' it. - It doesn't make no fuckin' sense. Jaws, Jaws? Film. - Jurassic park? - Film. - Sunset Boulevard. - All right, film. Minority Report. All right, all right, do you wanna get off Spielberg's dick for a minute, Jesus. Listen Nath. This plan, robbin' a bank, you know that's mad, right? - Nah, it's fuckin'. - You too? Come on man, it's a fuckin' bank, all right? Think about it. In four weeks, with no fuckin' plan, how the fuck are we even gonna do it? There's no money in banks anymore. It's all digital. Not with this bank. Three to four hundred K. Yeah, because it's a police bank. Pension's, all that. - I know, I did my research. - Police bank, what the fuck is he talkin' about? This is suicide. The rookie as well, like mate. Hey, I need new blood, all right. Pencil is doin' a stint, Chris is, I mean, we can't trust Chris. After that last job. Something went wrong, he seemed culpable, he might be on that bake. You know, my money's on Saida for that last job and it's downfalls anyway. Listen, here's the translucent condition, I'm doin' this job, even if me and tenderfoot here have to go in alone. If you guys want me to step out, I can. Shut the fuck up. The fuck you talkin' about. Don't speak another fuckin' word, you hard-rock right now. It's fuckin' suicide all right, it's fuckin' suicide. Just think about it man, use your fuckin' head, huh? You wanna fuckin' die? Fuck the piglets. Here we shall take our stand. We rob their asses. I want out, being a whippin' boy. You know the rules. What we do is strictly business, it's never personal. But this, I can't commit to this. Look I'm sorry, mate, all right? I'm in. Just like that, the Beatles break up. Nah, this ain't the end, mate. It's all right, don't worry, alone I left the womb, so same I'll enter the tomb. Hey, it's me. What do you mean, who me? Oh, right, yeah, I'm sure you were. Oh really? Yeah, I bet you are. Jane Perkins, right? Listen, there's a gun in my drawer. It's a 357 magnum, five bullets. You need to take it and shoot him, don't even think twice about it. I can't shoot him. Why not? Have you ever shot anyone before? Besides, you're a mortgage broker so, why do you even have a gun in the first place? This is a highly secured bank. Even the mortgage brokers? He wants to kill you. Why would he wanna kill me? Because he's fuckin' black, that's why. He'll die and take you down with him, he's crazy, he'll kill you. And you? No, cause you're not gonna tell him that I'm in the bathroom. He's coming, just get the gun and fuckin' kill him. Mhm, yeah, mhm. What the fuck? Who was that you was talkin' to? - Who is it? - I wasn't talkin' to anyone. Hey Mr. You, you do not wanna do whatever you're about to do. Okay, listen, listen to me, please tell me what's going on, Madison, honey, you're gonna be all right. Mr. You, listen, talk to me. Talk to me, come on. You are in control of this situation, nothing has to happen that you don't want to happen right now. Come on, talk to me. Talk to me, let me hear somebody's voice. You wanted proof of life, you got it. Oh, thank god, I didn't, I didn't need this fuckin' drama, I drank too much coffee, I'm gonna have a fuckin' heart attack, Madison, honey, are you hurt, are you okay? I'm okay. I'm not hurt, I'm fine. Good, listen, I'm doing everything I can to get you out of here. Spoiler alert, you're fuckin' failing. Madison honey, I just found out that my daughter is actually a fan of yours, all right. Now do you have a family member that you want us to be in touch with like a. No. Okay, well I need to promise. - Okay. - No. - That's enough. - Mr. You. Get me my fuckin' car. Madison Jones. Say that again. Madison Jones. Madison Jones. That's right. Sounds like a famous name. Ready when you are, Madison Jones. Are we doing scene two? What's it say on the side, Madison Jones? Scene two. So what are we doing here? Top of scene two, let's go, Madison Jones. When they asked me if I saw him, I told them no, not in awhile. I said that with such an assuredness, like it meant nothing. The night before, he stumbled back into our house, same as always, cocky, complacent, as if he belonged there. Still, his breath wreaking as the same spirit he was so fond of. He kept on telling me how much he loved me and how he didn't mean it the last night, he never means it, but he does it again, and again, and again. When he does, I feel ashamed. Not because I am a victim but because I feel intrinsically obliged to forgive him. I am ashamed because I am numb to anger. I can do it again. No thanks, Madison. Thank you. I can do it again, I was a little. We'll be in touch with your agent, Madison. I'm available for the whole thing, by the way, totally free. Thanks, Madison. - What do you mean it was okay? - It was okay. Did they say that? I mean, did they say you were okay? Did you they say you were magnificent, did they say? I don't know. Well, you were there. No, it was okay. Oh fuck, suppose you're gonna want some food now, all right? Yes, that's why we're here. You say it's okay, that's okay, this is okay. How was your food? Okay, I mean, that's all I ever get from you. It's okay, okay, okay, okay. Maybe I'm just okay. I get you an audition. Big film, biggest audition of your life, why can't you be great or magnificent even, where is this waitress? Okayish, okay. Yeah, who said that? The dalai lama. I don't even know who that is? No? Well I've seen all those buddhism websites on your laptop. You've been looking at my history? - So? - Do I not get any privacy? All I want is for you to say, mum, I love you, thank you for the auditions, the loving, the food, the hot coffee. Where is this fucking waitress? Might be a waiter. They charge you service charge, what service are they referring to? I'm not sure I wanna act. What? Madison Jean Brown, repeat yourself, I didn't quite hear you. Jean, I don't know what your middle name is, Brown, I like singing. You didn't say that. Say what you said before. I said I'm not sure I wanna act. Not sure? What does not sure even mean? Okay, I do not want to act, Jean. Listen, I don't wanna be that football mum, you know, mumager, I'm not trying to live my life through you, seriously. I've done the acting thing, I was successful. Oh, was? I do not, at all, need to live my life through you, I really don't. But you got a talent. - Yeah, singing. - Acting. Well dad thought it was singing. Oh I'm sorry, where is that yank now? Oh, is that the guy who ran off with all your money? We don't know that, okay? Wake up Madison, you're 16, nearly 17, just wake up. Some service here. Wow, noise pollution. Noise pollution. You, my dear, are a walking carbon fuckin' footprint, every time you open your mouth, a polar bear dies. Okay, ridiculous. Are we staying in a hotel tonight, or? No, tonight we are staying in a lush mansion. Managed to suck some rich guy's cock. He's putting us up for the night. At least someone shut your mouth for a bit. Some fucking service here. You know I want what's best for you, right? I know I wasn't around when you was younger, I was too busy with my career. I knew that's why you still call me Jean, I get it, but I. This is never about me. It's always about you. I want you to have a chance at this, and I'm not talking about acting, I'm talking about life. I want you to have the best, you're my girl. If anything were to happen to you, I don't what I'd do. Don't ever leave me. I love you. I love you too. Get off the floor. Hey, get off the floor. It's dirty. Don't tell me what to do. People always tell me what to do. Not anymore. That's life. Get used to it. All day long, my mom, do this, do that. My dad, god, fuck him. My dad, he used to preach to me all the time. He should've been a preacher. Is that who you were talking to on the phone? - Your mom? - No. Right, who then? - Does it matter? - It matters to me. - So. - So that Stockholm Syndrome you spoke of. How 'bout now? No one ever listens to a thing I say. My whole life, they think I'm some simpleton, got no voice, that's what they think. Maybe they're right. Now look at this mess, everything's fucked, fuckin' chaos theory. - Not chaos theory. - No? Chaos theory is the exact opposite of chaos, it's the, doesn't matter. Something is everything and nothing at the same time. Something, not everything, exactly everything is everything and nothing at the same time so your gun, the floor, this situation, you, me. - Sit down. - This wall. - Sit down. - The table. Sit down! Do you get it? - No. - You can exactly put all importance, no importance into something, it's weight, it's value, it's what you choose it to be. - All right. - You get it. - Sure. - Ah, you don't get it. I do. It's some spiritual vegan bullshit. - God, what is your problem? - What? I don't what you believe in, you have a gun, you have an attitude, - but why either? - Because. Because? - Yeah, because. - So you want chaos? Yeah, I want chaos theory. Ugh, annoying, god, did you even go to school? I did go to school. Maybe not one as fancy as yours, but I did. I'm not stupid. What about your dad, hm? What about him? Is he something and nothing at the same time? Why'd you bring my dad up for, hm? Trying to wind me up? Just curious. So? My name is Madison Jones, I'm 16, 17 next week, these are my profiles and these are my hands. I don't get it. When they asked me if I saw him, I told them no, not in awhile. I said that with such assuredness like, like it meant nothing. The night before, he stumbled back into our house, same as always, cocky, complacent, as if he belonged. Still, his breath wreaking of the same spirit he was so fond of, he kept on telling me how much he loved me. And how he didn't mean it that night. He never means it. But he does it again, and again, and again. When he does, I feel ashamed. Not because I'm a victim, but because I feel intrinsically obliged to forgive him, I am ashamed because I am numb to anger. How was that? It's from a script from a film I auditioned for about a month ago, I probably didn't get it. I thought you said you were a singer. That was, good, that was really good. You got a talent. I wasn't as good as that in the audition. I didn't wanna get it. I didn't want my mum to be right. Didn't want her to win. You won though. How? Got me off the floor. Happy? - Where's this car? - What car? I made a demand while you were in the bathroom - on your phone. - At least I wasn't taking a shit when you burst in, right? You trust them? Most likely I walk out of here, they shoot or arrest me. So let me go then. No, I get it, you can't let me go. You need me. So what's the plan? I don't know. I wish they didn't shoot him. He'd have a plan. A way out, I was just working on it. Working on it, no, you're sitting here crying feeling sorry for yourself, I mean, come on man, you've gotta pull yourself together. Have you even looked at that fire exit door since we got back in here? Hm, what if, what if they come storming in, hm? Smash everything down, take you away, you're just hiding. So listen, there's still some money left over in the bank, you can grab some. When the vintage car comes, walk me out the front door with you, use me as a shield, they are not gonna risk shooting some teenage white girl who's got so much to live for. Okay, then, when the car comes, yeah, you're gonna put me in the car, dump the car anywhere, dump me anywhere, get a new ID, get on a plane and bounce. - Bounce? - Bounce. - New ID? - Yeah, you're probably gonna have to get rid of your phone, get a burner, I don't know, plane hop to Cuba or Brazil, some place hot. - Done this before? - I watch movies. Moves or films? What's the difference? Jaws, film, Minority Report, movie. I think. I don't get it. How much do you reckon's there? Oh I saw a bunch of cash when you dragged me in here. There could be hundreds, maybe even thousands, it's all on the floor. I mean, you could live off thousands for awhile, right? - What do you like? - Like? In life, what are your hobbies, your interests? - Well I don't know. - Come on, there must be something. I like cars, I like vintage cars. You sure? Sorry, it just seems like something you'd say to make it seem to people like you have an interest in life. You know, a boy's thing. Yeah, I'm sure, I was a mechanic. Oh my god, well there you go, eureka, right, this is what you do, okay? You are gonna move to Bolivia, set up a vintage car store, maybe even a garage and then, you're gonna call it, ready, wait for it, Nath's Place, you know, in honour of your friend. - Maybe. - I mean what were you gonna do with the money anyway? Buy a car, get out the hood. Just drive. It's a good idea, I mean, no one wants to live in the hood. Well why am I the lucky one that gets to leave? Who cares? It's your life, free will. Yeah, I guess. How's your upper class mansion? Mansion? No, no, I don't live in a mansion. Bullshit. Fuckin' suburban girl if ever saw one. With your suburban problems, I can see it in your eyes. Daddy ran off with my rich girl money bullshit. Think what you wanna think. We all have our problems. There is money. Told you. I'm gonna do it. Mr. You, how you doin' baby? I would love to talk to Madison. Where's my car? All right, the car is gonna take. - You've got one hour. - I need. - 90 minutes or she dies. - I need at least two, don't be, what do you mean, she dies, you mother? When the car comes, we go straight out the front door, take as much cash as we can. How you been? You mean since the last time? Yeah, exactly right. Pretty good, miss this room though. Yeah? It's got a charm, a certain palatial aesthetic to it. Palatial? Plenty of time to read in here, huh? In here you either push weights or push pages. Or push dope. No sir, not me. Drugs are the devil's food. I got a list of misdemeanours here that suggest that you may be consuming the devil's food. Is that what you wanna do? Spend the rest of your life in jail? Is that for? Sure, go ahead. Thank you, sir. Cut the sir, shit. Where were we? I asked you if you wanna spend the rest of your life. The rest of my life in jail? Yeah, I remember now. I'd favour not to. - Yeah? - Yeah. Then why re offend? I mean, some of these are repeat offences. Can I? Go for it. Most gangster move ever, Ceaser, knowing his reign would one day end, maybe in betrayal, writes in his will, Augustus, a boy, nearly 17, would acquire all his wealth, upon his own certain demise. Octavian. I'm sorry, what was the point of that? Nothin'. Wouldn't you be happier doing a normal thing? Normal thing? Yeah, a J-O-B, someone to love, a nice clean bed, garden, maybe a dog or two. I'm allergic to dogs. And is that why you think we were put here on this earth? Three percent of animals are monogamous, home building, cookie cutter. Three to five percent, and we're not animals. No we're better than animals. You know this morning, when I purchased my daily coffee, I was served by a pretty coloured girl who always serves me. I think she's Nigerian or somethin'. She got them scars, irrelevant. Point is, I wasn't served by no penguin or a parakeet or even a dolphin. Apparently dolphins are meant to be pretty smart. But I never seen a dolphin trade on the stock exchange. Animals are pretty useless. Well, that sir, is a factual statement. Cut the sir shit. Again, we reached an impasse. Do you wanna spend the rest of your life in jail? All this education you've taught yourself? Don't you wanna show the world how smart you've become? Kay, let's play this out. I get outta here, I go apply for say, 15 jobs. That's the normal thing, right? Now I get interviews, cause I got a degree in here and one out there, so they'll see me for sure, I get there, nice suit, say I borrow one from a friend. I start talkin', you know, turn on the charm, tell 'em a tale about Moken sea gipsies of the Andaman Sea and how they developed the ability to focus sight underwater so they could hunt for they food. Tell 'em a joke or two, you know, get 'em on my side. Now at this stage, they love me. Then they ask me that, menial question, you know, the one they ask you for mere formality. Do you have a criminal record? Expecting a quick, firm no. I mean, I know my shit, got a nice suit, two degrees, dialled back demeanour, oh he speaks so well, how could I have a record? But, in fact, I retort yes, sheepishly. Their jaws drop, I don't get the job, I gotta eat. Government wages ain't enough. So if I gotta eat before somebody else than that's just the way it's gotta be. There's other ways, though, isn't there? There's ways you can get out of here early and be good for your community. My community? Your community. And which one would that be, master? Please tell me, sir. Didn't I tell you not to call me sir? Now are we animals, huh, huh? I can't hear you. I can't hear you. Since we agree, we are not animals, since we now have an understanding, I think we both also agree, you should help your community. Because we all need to be normal. For this job, I'm Quint, you Brody, no more real names. What's that called? What you're fixin' to buy? '70 to '75 BMW CSL 3.0. You seen batman? '60s batman, bam, boom, crash! It's similar to his, they actually called it the batmobile. Someday's you just can't get rid of a bomb. That's from the show. Hey man, you trust Saida? Got no reason not to. Started to deduce that she may have been the reason that that last job went Hitchcock. Remember that Lisa I told you about? Yeah, she gon' be there later. She saw some doubt in my mind. Paranoid, man. We gettin' the gun off Saida at nine, right? What time? Time to get a watch, nigga. What's wrong? You don't like that word. I see you flinchin' every time I use it. Is that why you keep usin' it? Ain't my favourite word. Why? It's oppressive. Oppressive? What, you not a nigga now? Nope. Why? Oh but, cause you white and black? No, I'm not naive. To know that when a white person sees me, any person sees me, they see black. Then? It's oppressive, that's all man. Oppressive. I do love how you use that word. As if it's academic. Those academic books you construe, they don't tell us about African monarchs. Or Mansa Musa of Mali, the richest man ever, black African. Inclination toward deception through passive education. You got me all wrong. I don't read books. I just don't like the word, that's all man. Nah man, you gotta have reason behind things. Like, you have a liability to articulate. There should be no utterance lacking delineation. Okay, well, I just don't feel like I, that word, that word makes me feel enslaved. Well shit, enslaved, he says. Nigga, you can't even say the word. Course you enslaved, enslaved by letters all lined up in a row. N-I-G-G-E-R. When you learn to declare it, then you shall be free. Say it. Come on, now. - No. - Boy, I am a victim of disappointment in you. Yeah, you the most enslaved free nigga I met. And look at that milky skin. And here you are, fixin' to rob a bank. What a squander, what a zealous squander. Do you know what I would do with skin like that? What's in this job for you? Besides the 200K split. Yeah. You can't just be doing this because you're angry with the police. I mean, we are criminals. - We made that choice. - I counter. We didn't choose this life. It chose us. We were born to be in this exact moment. In this exact space, having this exact same conversation. Didn't choose to be subjected to slavery. They won't let us erect statues, so we'll tear theirs down. They won't salute our heroes, so we'll make our heroes martyrs. They won't acknowledge our brevity, so we'll become disquieted lighthouses. Puttin' 'em in darkness. Blindin' 'em with a light so dense that they'll be forced to look. Then, and only then, will I feel a sense of parity. Now, this score tomorrow don't go right, they gon' tell you a lot of shit about me, some of it may be true, most lies, but understand one thing, this is personal. I don't give a fuck about the money. I'm gon' plant a flag. Right. What time is it? Time to get a watch, nigga. Damn. Hey, you wanna leave without payin' again? Is there any other way to leave? Call me Lisa, with an S. Not Liza, not Eliza, or even fuckin' Elizabeth. Lisa with an S. Lisa with an S. I'm the morning after pill of his little operations. When shit goes wrong, I fix shit that goes wrong. And I know you motherfuckers gon' end up callin' me. Bank job, bullshit. Lisa with an S, wanna keep schtum for a minute? Like it? What's up with the fuckin' stripes? Long story I don't favour to share now. - Want her? - No. What's wrong with her? She's high, she's having fun. - So what's the situation? - With? - With? - Yeah with? With tomorrow, Saida. Job is fine as silk. Oh yeah? Like the last job? Silky too? Cause that shit when haywire. Somethin' a little suspect about it. I was thinkin' the same thing. He taught you all of his tricks? Most. Taught him any of yours? So, we good with the gun? Now hold on there, Brody. Me and my old friend Saida here are prattlin'. Not often we can just sit, chew the cud. We can talk about all sorts of things. Religion, politics, the last job. The fuck went on with it, so forth. Oh come on, everyone knows you're busted, everyone knows you're jaded. - Listen, I ain't busted. - The love of God, make this be your last job. I got plenty left in the tank. - All right. - All right. I'm going for a piss. Ya'll. Why the fuck didn't you back me up, huh? You're the one sewing doubt, what, abruptly, you're a fuckin' mute now? Motherfucker, don't even go there with me. I'm not her, you need me. So don't piss me off. Screwdriver. It's called that cause years ago, back in the Persian Gulf, the guy who concocted it, used a screwdriver to stir it. Ever had a screw, driver before? Oh. You wicked, huh? Hey man, I think we should get the gun and leave. The atmosphere don't feel right. There's nothin' to worry about. How's that? Stiff one. No, I don't drink and drive. Wouldn't wanna kill a young kid. What's that? Go ahead, you gonna sit on your little perch and chirp all night long? Why don't you go home and sleep, old man? Got a big day tomorrow. Saida, can you give us the gun so we can go? Ah, that's cute. You think cause we fuck, you control me? - I'm just sayin'. - Do me a favour, don't say. And as for your derision's and accusations, you're done. You know, there comes a time when even the greatest of athlete's careers wane, he just can't run no more. He can't hit a ball as far, can't swing a punch, he can't fuck. He takes his golden fuckin' handshake and he goes off into the history books of discardedment. Then sometime, 20, 30 down the line, some guys are sittin' around a table, talking about the great boxers and one of them goes, remember Joe Lewis? And the other one goes, ah him, from the olden days, yeah. He was good but he weren't no Mike Tyson. Fuck you and your fuckin' set of feminist morals. - Oh, don't go there. - Shut the fuck up! You didn't say shit before, fuck you too. It's a gender thing, huh? You upset because I control your narrative and I got tits? I've seen more balls on a unic. Take your fuckin' rookie, take your fuckin' gun and then go fuck off into the annals of time, you fucking jaded asshole. Is that what you countin' on, huh? You countin' on these kids you be groomin'. How they gon' grow up and become Mike Tyson. Pigeons and all that. When the truth is, you out here killin' 'em? Trying to prove your worth, cause you ain't got none. Ah, the fuckin' rumours, I set you straight on those. Yeah I killed a kid, he stole from me, I'd do it again. Damn, that's fucked up. Where's your fucking sense of sisterhood? Oh, oh, I'm just here for the money. Y'all motherfuckers got some Billy Jean King vs Bobby Riggs shit goin' on. Y'all need to simmer the fuck down before someone get hurt. So what of it, Saida, huh? Since you out here confessin'. I swindled jewellers, get out clean, then all a sudden, these porkchops got they fingers all over me. Gettin' me on this charge and that charge. Sending me up for the big house. You gon' tell me you didn't do that to me? You didn't do that to me? And fuck yeah, I'm a veteran. Long, tall, I'm a vet. Seasoned but I ain't jaded. And you, fuckin' audacity, to call me jaded. Joe fuckin' Lewis? Trying to curtain me as washed up? You're a fuckin' dilettante. I'm out here gettin' my hands dirty. I'm Mike Tyson, motherfucker. Yeah, yeah, you sit on your fuckin' pink throne, collecting off of my hard work. You know, when I was a kid, I used to have this bunny. My family actually gave it the name, Bunny, fuckin' imaginative, I loved that rabbit. One day, Bunny was gone. My mother, she tells me she gave Bunny to a friend, but I knew the truth. My mother was a decent woman, she knew Bunny was old, in pain. She put it out of it's fuckin' misery. Gotta tell ya, I ain't too much thought about that Bunny ever since. Fuck you. We gotta call the cops! Somebody please call the cops! You guys, come on, you gotta call the cops! Somebody please call the cops! We gotta call the cops, we gotta do something, please! Nath, we goin' now? Yeah. We goin' now. Nice gun. Want it? What you doin'? Hungry. Will you stop doing that? So, how much money do I get? Five percent. I should really get 50 percent. I mean, full disclosure now, you know, since we're working together. Since we're a team. Oh, not working together. Since we're besties. - No, we are not a team. - Yep. Mhm, no. I lied, earlier on. I didn't come here to get the money from my dad's account. I came to get his address. I wanted to find out why he didn't want me. You know what, I'm a good person, why wouldn't he want me, why would he choose money over me? People are fucked. Can't be as simple as that. It is. People are fucked. No one cares. That's not true, my mum cares, she's just, she just cares too much. She cares about herself. You don't know her. People are not selfless. My dad, my dad, he, he got himself thrown in jail and then OD'd there when I was 12. I spent most of my life in and out of foster homes. Shit foster homes. People tellin' me they love me in spite of, always in spite of, always tainted. One of these foster parents used to hit me so hard, my skin would bleed. I'd hide in the cupboard and say my name over and over and over again until the pain was gone. Block out everything. The guy, asshole husband, I forget his name, he was the worst. He'd hit me, he'd call me stupid. One day I stole a hammer from the shed, big one, could barely lift it. And I smashed his fuckin' head in. And then I hit him a couple more times. Did he die? I don't remember. My dad. He should've been a preacher. You said that already and it doesn't mean everybody else. Said what already? You're 16, you've got plenty of time to get like this. Your dad being a preacher and I'm not like that, I'm not fucked. When I see my dad, I'll move forward, be able to close that chapter in my life. No spite, no anger. You're defined by your actions. No, I'm defined by my race. No one is racist nowadays, your actions define you. I'm sorry, I'm confused, what the fuck are you talking about? We're in a new world, okay, so I think if you feel oppressed, your mind is clearly living in the past, you know? Self slavery, Gen Z, we're. Let's, let's, let's move on. Geez, I'm debating race with a fuckin' 12 year old. The fuck I done with my life? Got anymore of that chocolate? There's none, Jane Perkin's must be on a diet. What time is it? - Uh, 10 PM. - Where's this car? There's no other exits. Maybe a vent? - Where? - I, I, I don't know. I'm thinkin' out loud. The front door, it's so risky. You gonna leave me? What are you talking about? After, when we leave the bank, are you just gonna leave me? Well, yeah. You go back to your mom with your cut, I drive some place. Don't know where. Can I come with you? Of course not. You're 16, I'm 28. You've got your whole life ahead of ya. We're from different places. You've got opportunities, a future. There's gotta be other exits. Nath wanted to die, become a villain, a martyr. Maybe I should become a villain, a super villain. What'd you say? - I said maybe I should become a villain. - No, before that. Listen, why don't you just shut your mouth? You're a kid, you don't know what you're talking about. The thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it, Oscar Wilde. Who's that, your dad? I thought you didn't wanna leave. I thought you wanted to kill me, now you wanna leave? The fuck wrong with you? Do you even know what day of the week it is? I'm warning you. You're stupid. You're still that same child that used to hide in the basement. - Yeah, you're weak. - I'm weak? - Yeah. - I'm weak. - You're so stupid! - Shut the fuck up! Go on, call your dad, call 'em. I don't wanna, I don't wanna! I'm weak? Fuck you, I'm weak! You're a little girl, a fuckin' child. You, you ain't been through what I been through. You wanna trade places, hm? - See the kind of life I live? - Absolutely not! Then why are you here? Cause you got me hostage. Well, we just plans to fuckin' leave. Everyone else leaves. Look, we can start this journey together. - Really? - Yeah, things go, yeah. Maybe, but you, how did you know his name? Nath. Oh, yeah, you mentioned it earlier. No, I never said it. - Yeah, see, you said. - I always called him Quint. You also said you knew my name, huh? How do you know my name, huh? Have you been working with him from the start? Is that why you want the money? Who do you work for, are you workin' for Lisa? Yeah, her two, you know, she loves him so much. Stop fuckin' with me. Mr. You. Who's the next contestant on the Price is Right, baby? Would you like a new car, cause I got a new car out here for you kids, how you gettin' along? Good. I wanna get the fuck outta here. You sound agitated, Mr. You. I'm scared, he's trying to kill me. You're against me, all of you, I know you are. Why did I just hear her say that you're gonna kill her, did you try to kill her? You tell me my car's outside, lure me out, kill me? She says she knows my name, you're playin' like you don't know my name, you know my fuckin' name. You must've seen my records by now, my fuckin' PO files, huh? Don't play me like I'm fuckin' stupid, I swear to fuckin' god, I'll fuckin' kill her. I don't know what's going on. I've got my gun pointed at her right now. I believe you, I believe you. Tell me what the fuck's going on? Okay, what do you wanna know? I'll shoot her, I swear to fuckin god. Start talking. - What do you want to know? - All over the fuckin' wall. Talk! Okay, Mr. You! Don't call me that, I, you know my fuckin' name! You know everything, stop playin' me. Tell me the truth. I'm trying to tell you the. - Talk! - Mr. You, if you. Call me that again and I'll fuckin' shoot her. All right, listen, listen, there's a lot to unpack right now but the only thing that's important is that your car is gonna be here in 10 minutes. Let's get you out of there, let's get you on the road, let's get you driving, okay? And it is, I gotta tell you, the car is fuckin' cherry man, everybody out here is callin' it the batmobile, you know? Did you hear that? I heard it. That's the sound of my gun being cocked. Yeah, I know that sound. Tell me the truth. Yeah, fine, I know some stuff. I know your fuckin' name, woopdidoo, okay? I've seen your jacket, I also happen to know all the phone calls you made to Lisa and what she's trying to get you to do. I also know your PO is dead, I know that Nath Clark, your friend that you're so worked up about, is beneath you man. That guy's a CI, he's a criminal informant, he's a fuckin' professional snitch, I don't know that he sang about today's job necessarily, I think he was honestly here to commit suicide by cop. - What, he's a snitch? - But if you are not careful, he is gonna take you fuckin' with him, do you understand me? - Informant? - Yes. Why'd you shoot him? Well, CI's only belong to one cop, that's why they're confidential, nobody else knows about it. The guy's out here didn't know, they just saw bank robbers so they shot a bank robber. Cause he's black, cause he's black. It has nothing to do. You see a nigga runnin' and he must be a criminal. He was in the middle of committing a crime. It's okay to cheer a nigga when he's runnin' with a ball in his hand or in his foot, or he's a passin' a baton, but any other time, he must be trouble, huh? Come on, Mr. You, let's talk serious. I told you not to fuckin' call me that, now I'm gonna fuckin' kill her. No, she's not the one. You're a man of morals, I like that. A guy should have morals, right? Yeah, definitely. A man of morals would definitely understand the basic ethics of conversation. One person speaks, the other one listens. I thought you had finished. I had not finished. It's just, you asked a question, - I just assumed you. - You assumed? Yeah, I assumed, I thought you had fin. Listen, listen, listen, let's not start gettin' upset and angry with each other. I'm not gettin' angry. - You're gettin' very angry. - No I'm not. Calm down. No, I assure you, I'm not gettin'. Look, what are we gonna do about the monetary situation? I can probably get it in a couple of days. I just need to see a few people and. You know what? - Don't worry about it. - What? - Yeah, it's fine. - Seriously? Yeah, I'm feelin' generous, don't worry about it Well that's uh, should I go? Yeah, why not Bob? Why not? Let's get breakfast. Breakfast? Yeah, pancakes, eggs, bacon, waffles, toast, whatever. Yeah, yeah that's great. But maybe we should clean this body off the street. Sure, after breakfast. But how 'bout now? I don't really wanna get pinched for something as stupid as leaving a dead body on the street. Bill, Bill, Billy, Bill. You watch too much TV, nobody gets arrested anymore. Yes, people do. Bill, I swear to God, you touch that, I'll be leaving two bodies on the street whilst I eat pancakes. - What's it like, four? - Say five. - Feels like four. - Four, five. Oh, what's this? - Taking the gun. - Cause? What's it matter? It's my gun, all along. Yeah, the thing is. - The thing? - The thing is, I like it. I like the keep mementos of the people I waste. There's plenty down there. Billy, Billy. Why don't you stop fuckin' about? What do you mean? Give me the gun. No can do. I don't get this gun back, I'm in with this guy. That's twice you've insulted me tonight. How so? A. you called me a crazy person. And B. you took my gun. Jesus, it's my fucking gun. We're still talkin' about this. I borrowed this piece off of someone and believe me, you don't wanna fuck with that person. Earlier tonight, you asked me for a piece, I gave you a piece, I said, I said I needed it back, I said that. It's like, Jesus, I told you. It's not like I didn't tell you. You know, you're unprofessional. Your partner wants a tool, and you refuse. What? You fuckin' kidding me? You shoot a guy in the street and then go and have fuckin' pancakes while his dead fuckin' body bleeds out and I'm unprofessional? Have you got beef with me? Yeah, I gotta a fuckin' beef with you. You're fuckin' unhinged, man. And by the fuckin' way, we're not fuckin' partners, okay? McGoldrick asked me to do this job with you and I fuckin' begged him not to. I said anyone but fuckin' Ant. I fuckin' hate workin' with you, man. You're fuckin' unreliable, you're fuckin' insane and you're fuckin' stupid. What the fuck? You know what, Bill? You might be right. I think I am clinically insane. I mean all this shit over a fucking gun. You're a special bitch. Marry me. Hurry up, nigga. Typical. Fuck happened to my merchandise? Just told you, ya know. It's uh, you know. No, I don't fucking know. Why don't you tell me again? It works. Yeah? We better put it to the test. Some service here! Wanna get some pancakes? Is this the getaway car? It's a little conspicuous. You seen Wages of Fear? Nah. That's the one about the trucks or something, ain't it? I used to be a mechanic. Yeah, you said previous. You got a proclivity for repetition. You nervous, you tend to repeat yourself. A little. Got your gun? Yeah. Not sure if it works. We won't need to use it though, right? Nath, last night, Saida. What the fuck happened to her? This fuckin' gun. Don't call me Nath. Now at some point in your life, you gon' have to face up to your own responsibilities, nigga. Now I need to know that you down with this. I'm not talkin' no half in, half out, collation shit. I'm talkin' true Stalin dictatorship, red motherfuckin' state, communism shit. You gotta be in this, with your heart and your head. Her fuckin' head. Get over it, bitch deserved to die. Who wears sunglasses indoors, anyway? Story goes, Julius Ceaser, before he died, he left all of his wealth in the hands of a 17 year old boy. Octavian, later known as Augustus. Wasn't even related. By doing so, by making that choice, his legacy was more far reachin' than if he had lived 100 years. Let's do the do. Get out of the way! Listen to me, listen to me right now Wyatt, you have control over what happens next. Fuck it, fuck! Wyatt? I know today hasn't gone exactly the way that you wanted it to. Make that my life. Right, but your car is gonna be here any minute, I swear to god it is, and I think we both know that I can't let you leave in it but that car is yours, man. You know, give me the girl, do your time and the car will be yours when you get out. Wyatt, what a name. What, what, what kind of a black man names his own kid Wyatt? That's. My dad, he had it in for me from the beginning. Come on man, you're gonna get me in trouble. If I agree with you on an open walkie channel, somebody's gonna call me racist. - That's an irony. - Oh shit. You shot the nigga that was with you. That's, that's, that's poetic justice. You shot the house nigga. We don't have put it that way. That's poetic justice, circle of life. Got shot, he got shot by the people he was helping. Well I'm glad you're finding the whole situation so funny. - So you comin' out? - You're right. He did wanna die, the fuckin' martyr. Hey man, at the end of the day, none of us is perfect. I mean, my fuckin' wife drags me into this therapist that I have to pay for. Fuck your wife. Okay, if you don't fuckin' like her, then leave. Stop bringing her up, bitchin' about her, moanin', I'm sick of it, I'm fuckin' sick of it. Listen. Fuck, why is he a fuckin' snitch? Oh fuckin' asshole, fuck, why, why, why? Why, why, why? I don't. Fuckin' suicide mission motherfucker. Hey, Wyatt, I know you don't wanna hear me mention her name but, just between us and whoever the fuck else is listening, I'm cheating on my wife, okay? Honestly, I don't think she cares because I'm pretty sure she's cheating on me too, I guess what I'm trying to say, and I hope you're listening, is that we're all, all of us are shit morally speaking. Okay? Let the girl go, do your time. Nobody's been killed in there yet, I can still get you that two years. I'll let her go, give me my car. You got it, I'll have it here in five minutes. You said, Nath, I'm scared. He shouted at you and said if you use his real name one more time, he'll fucking kill you. Do you remember? I, I, I sometimes, I say things and, I can't remember. I lied earlier on. That's your super villain power. Lying. I did see a clerk. I made up this whole story. About how me and my dad were shopping, we got separated and I lost my phone. The lady gave me his number. So I called him. You're a hostage. You've just been told you're probably gonna be shot and you call your dad? Not your mom, who loves you? Your words. I just don't, get it, I just don't, I don't understand. Fuckin' human race, I, I don't, I just. I'm tired, man, I just. Why'd you try and help me escape? I wanted you to like me. I need someone to like me, I need you to not leave me. Please don't leave me. Please, please, please, please, please. I need you to like me, please like me. I'm not your dad. Just, I get confused sometimes. Nothing means anything. Everything means nothing. Dad, hey it's me. Yeah, I'm sorry, I think I got cut off earlier. Yeah, I'm on the TV? I'm fine. I'll be out soon, I promise. Dad? Why don't you want me? Yeah, yeah, okay. You still don't remember me, do you? We've crossed paths before. You ran past me and my mom about a month ago. When you did, I felt something. What? Relieved. Look at that, a '70 to '75 BMW CSL. Launched the M brand. Thing of beauty. See that, boy? Where did you get that, sweet boy? Did you steal it from the shop? Listen to me very carefully, son. You listening? What I always told you about privilege. It can be taken. It is for sale. Don't give it to you, you gotta take it. One dime at a time, one blow at a time. And if they resist, if they stand up tall, if they refuse to share with you the spoils, shoot them down. No one act is without consequence. That is the symmetry of life. It is comic, that being said, you steal again, I'm gonna beat the livin' life outta ya. All things come to an end. Wyatt, my man, your car is here. Show me a picture, no, a video. Yes sir, Master Bruce. There you go, you see it, we all good? Okay listen, now things have changed a little bit so I, I can't hold the boys back much longer. I need you to go ahead and come on out now. Like right now. What's changed? Come on, man, just come on out. Sure, we're comin' out. Okay that's great, everybody, I need you to hold your fire, he is coming out peacefully and surrendering, does everybody hear me? I got another call coming through. Wait no, Wyatt, is it Lisa? Do not take that call. All right, don't take it, just. - Why? - Come out and get in your car stay on the phone with me. - I gotta go. - Don't take the fuck! Nath, he, um. - Right. - 10 minutes ago, so. He was a CI, you know that? Oh damn, I did not. You got my money? I thought you were meant to fix shit. Lisa, with an S, that's how you packaged yourself. Yeah well, I can't fix a body. Call me. I fix shit. What do you expect me to bring him back to life? You ass... Hey man, I assume you know about Nath now, right? Listen, you gotta let her go. You gotta come out, just like you promised. You can still drive off into the sunset. I think I've accepted this is how it ends. My whole life, people have told me left is right, right is left. I was born for this moment. Come on man, the big guy upstairs, that's not how he works. When we fuck up, it's on us. I, I have fucked up a lot and I chose all of it. It doesn't matter. What do you fuckin' mean it doesn't matter? It matters a whole hell of a lot to that girl that's in there with you, it matters to me. How can you be like this? How can you quit on yourself? Because, it's time I become a lighthouse. What the fuck does that mean? Just, I don't know what that means, Wyatt. Just come out here, get in this fuckin' car I got you because they are gonna storm this place and I can't stop them. They're going to come in, just. - Come on, just go. - Ultimately, everything has the weight I place on it. It's time I made a fuckin' decision and kept to it. Man, please, don't do this. I gotta be a martyr. Three times I could've had this gun tonight, but I didn't because I thought this was your story. Fucking die, you fuckin' black nigger, black fucker. I gotta say it again. Nice gun. Madison, the gun doesn't work properly, okay? Give me the gun, okay? Give me the gun. Madison, listen to me, let me shoot the gun, okay? Ultimately, everything has the weight I place on it. Madison, let me shoot the gun, okay? Let me shoot the gun. I do not wish to shed a drop of blood, but I must fight the course. Tis all that's left in me.
