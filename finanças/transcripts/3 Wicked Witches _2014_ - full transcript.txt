Haha.. Cheers.. So just as Robbie and I are about to finally do it, you come floating in the room... I walked in. You floated in! We saw you! You guys were high. You were high. About four feet off the ground as I remember. Robbie passes out. I freak out. You don't remember this?! You didn't put that little red hair clippie thing on the door to let me know you were..."busy". Yes, I did. Someone must Have taken it. Well, as I remember it, after my unexpected entrance, you and Robbie still had a pretty nice time that night. Yes, and I always wanted to ask you about that. Did you give Robbie something? What ever do you mean? Well after you left. And I convinced him you had never been there, and had must have imagined it. Robbie was "up" for hours. Robbie who has never lasted more than five minutes before. Well I wanted to make sure you had a great night after I left. I knew it! You little witch! Oh, well I'm a big witch now. I've noticed. Implants? No, about twelve years ago they suddenly just grew overnight. Only from you I would believe that. Haha... Pizza?! That was fast. Too fast. I just called three minutes ago. Oh my Gosh, Donna. I didn't think you were going to make it over. Is Tina here? I have to see her. Yes, of course. Please, come in. Donna! It's so good to see you again. It's been like... Twenty years. I know. Lana said you probably weren't coming because it's been one year since... Well I mean, I would totally understand. It's such a tragedy. To lose someone in an accident like that... It was no accident. My daughter was murdered. DONNA.. But I thought Justine fell... Ya, well so did the cops. So did every one. But they were wrong She was murdered And I have the proof. Donna what did you find? You'll see! She looks terrible. Her daughter died, Tina. cut her some slack. It's been a year. I thought by now... Ya But on the anniversary of her daughter's death? Who wouldn't get drunk? But now she's talking murder? Okay, guys. Were ready. So, Tina. I don't know how much Lana told you about what happened to my Justine. All I heard was that it was a college hazing prank that went bad somehow. Justine fell and broke her neck. Ya, It happened one year ago today. And that's what those College boys claimed. But I found something on-line last night. Something someone posted who probably thought it was over and nobody cared. Donna, What did you find? A video was shot the night that Justine died. Someone was filming it. They pulled it right away but I downloaded it as soon as I saw it. Watch this. What the hell is this? I'm sorry. It's part of my initiation. I was just supposed to take... Hey, guys! I found a little mouse trying to steal our cheese! Well, well, well. Who do we have here? A Delphi Pi sorority pledge, huh? Just let me go. Please. Looks like this mouse has quite a nice tail. What do you say, boys? Yeah! You bet. I wouldn't mind having some of that. Get off me! I didn't want to take this stupid pledge anyway. It's too late for that. Yeah, really too late. I'll handle this. As president of the Sigma Nu, I deem this mouse to be eaten by the the head cat on campus... And that's me. Hold her, guys. No! No! NO!! OW! SHIT! She's getting away! Go get her! Where you gonna go now, little mouse? Get away from that window! Uh!! She's trying to climb down the side of the house! (FEMALE SCREAM) Holy shit... Holy shit... Is she...? Oh man, I can't believe, oh my god, all that blood? Jesus, Shawn. What are we gonna do? Nothing. We did nothing. The bitch fell. We didn't kill her. Turn off that goddamn camera, Bryce. Round up the guys. We gotta talk... Oh my God, Donna. You...you just found this? I was looking around the web to see if anyone was writing about Justine on her one year anniversary of her death. And I just found that.. It was pulled almost immediately but I downloaded it as soon as I saw it . You have to take this to the police. I mean those guy's can be prosecute for murder. Or being an accessory. I am not going to the police. But they covered it up. Justine would have never ran out on that balcony If they haven't been chasing her They are responsible. Exactly, But their mothers and fathers probably going to get them off on a technically. You their faces on the video. Their voices are muffled and distorted. They'll probably deny it and giving our legal system, they'll probably walk. But you can't let them get away with it. I don't intend to. That's why I came over. I hated to interfere with your little reunion but I need your help. When we were in college, I saw you do things, Tina. We both did. And when were together, we made things happen. I mean we were kinda a coven. I...I wouldn't call our group a coven. Oh , we were just playing around like those girls in that movie, "The Craft". I know, but still those spells worked. I mean Professor McDonald giving you an "A" in Russian lit. And when my boyfriend cheated on me, he got the chicken pox for a month. And he already had the chicken pox when he was a kid. Oh man we had power and I bet if we got together we could get that power back. What are you suggesting? I want those bastards pay with their life for what they did to my little Justine. I want revenge! Donna, I know you're upset but we're grown women now. We're not witches. Speak for yourself, Lana. What do you mean? I never stopped "playing around" since we graduated from college. I've been fine-tuning my abilities over the years. You think we can do it? I know we can do it! I'll be right back. Ok! One large mushroom pizza. Oh right. Thanks. I have to get my wallet. Come on in! You wanna see some proof of my powers? I Sure do. You need something, ma'am? Let me see your hand for a moment, Greg. How did you know my name is... Greg? That's not important. What's important is what I want you to do. And what's that? Get naked for me, Gregory. What the hell?! Oh my God! I'm so sorry.. I...I don't know what happened! Wait! I didn't pay. Oh And let me give you a good tip. OKA-NU-NA AMAN-TRO - TABOO! Ohhhh.... Ohhhh.... Wait. Did he just...? I couldn't bare to see the guy unsatisfied. I told you, I've still got it. How did you think I received those "A's" from Professor McDonald? I thought you slept with him. Way too much effort. Especially when I can simply get him off without even lifting a finger.... Eww, Well, all i had to do was lifting a little finger. Haha.... Does that spell only work on guys? No. Works way better on females. Do you remember that uptight, frigid bitch, Crystal, from our chemistry class? The one turned into the school slut. You didn't?! Oh, I did. Multiple times. I think I overloaded her system. She said I dressed like a hooker. She was asking for it. I know six other people that are asking for it. Well then let's give it to them. Yes! OHNA-NENA-MUTON-TABOO! Okay. We are ready. Now, we just need a subject. We have six subjects. The boys who murdered my daughter. No, they are the targets for our revenge. We are conjuring up a demon, Donna. Demons? That sounds like black magic. It is, Lana. Murderous revenge falls under that category. Well, let's think about this. Donna, those guys didn't mean to kill Justine. No, They JUST planned to rape her. You think that's better? Of course not. But we don't know How it would have ended up. Perhaps they were just clowning around Speaking of clowning around... what's this? Oh, Something I picked in New Orleans last week. for my son Melvin. He didn't go for it. Thought it was too creepy-looking. Maybe he's too young. Too old. He just turned Eighteen . Well, I like it and it's perfect for our purposes. We want to kill the frat boy's. Not entertain them. Trust me. We'll be entertained. They will not. A revenge demon is much more controllable when it's trapped inside an object. That's the way we will get it to do our bidding. Now holds hands. Oh, Dark Lord. We call upon you to deliver us your minion of revenge to punish those who have harmed us and our children! KA-LA-NIC-TOM -ACULA- TABOO! Did it...did it work? It worked. It's waiting for us to give it it's assignment. It's Assignment? Who do you wish for it to kill? Isn't this dangerous what we're doing? Dangerous for who? For us. Didn't you always say that black magic corrupts the souls of those who use it? I don't know about you two but my soul was corrupted a long time ago. I learned in college that nice gals finish last. That doesn't work for me. I don't care anymore. Those frat boys contributed to the death of my daughter. Justine was my whole world. They must pay for what they've done. I...I guess you're right. Hey. Guy's The doll's gone. Where did it go? To start its' mission. So How do we know if he even succeeds? Is he going to come back here and report to us or something? When the deed is done, it will return. So, if it doesn't come back, does that mean the frat guys are still alive? Believe me we will know when each one of those frat rats is killed. How? We will feel it. The three of us are all now linked to the doll and the demon inside. What do you mean by linked? We will feel the kill. When the doll kills. Wait. What do you mean. We will feel the death? Feel the pain?! No, no we will feel the doll feels. Feel what the killer feels. The doll. How can a doll feel anything? It's an inanimate object. You're right. I mean is we will feel what the demon inside the doll feels when the Doll kills. What's it going to feel like? You'll see. A revenge demon lives to kill. When it accomplishes what it was created to do, it's... just a rush. Just go with it. Go with it? Go with what? God, I wish we were able to see what was Going on in the frat house. Oh Well, I believe that can be arranged. Ladies, lets go out to the pool. Perfect. Perfect for what? Water has a natural Reflection quality to it. Its like one great big mirror. And With a little magic... It can reflect anything we want it to. You've heard the famous saying, "Mirror, Mirror, on The Wall". Well, how about "Pool of water, show us all". How did you do that? What? You want the recipe? I do.. Is this a live image? Of course. But they won't be alive for very long. Haha... haha... Well girls Might as well get comfortable, girls. The show is about to begin. Really? You guy's are just going to sit back and get a tan while we watch a bunch of guys getting killed?! Yeah, that's pretty much the idea. I plan on enjoying the view. And what a view it is. Just look at him. Ugh... Ugh... Ugh... Ugh... Ugh... Ugh... Ugh... Ugh... Ugh... Ugh... Ahhh! Uhhh.. Ohhh.. What a rush. I think I was about to toss my cookies. It felt like someone put a knife into my brain. Well, everyone reacts Differently I'm told. But like I said, if you don't fight it, you might really enjoy it. Enjoy it? I think I need an aspirin... ...I think I need A dozen aspirins. Are you okay? Yeah, I don't know if i have the stomach for this. Oh You do. You just got butterflies. Did it feel like you were on a roller coaster? Yeah, on a corkscrew turn. That's exactly how I felt the first time I did it? The first time? Sometimes you get what you want in this world, you got to break the rules. Don't worry. Your stomach will Get use to it. Settle down. And it gets so much easier the second time around. The second time? One down. Five to go. little doll is far from finished. Ugh!! Ugh!! Ugh!! Ugh!! Ugh!! Ugh!! Ugh!! Ugh!! Uh!! Oh God!...Make... make it stop. Ohhh.... Ohhh.... Lean back, Donna. Don't fight it just let it consume you. Ohhh... There you go! Is...is that better? Yeah...yeah, that really helps. Mmmm.. Yes.. We've...we've got to stop this. This is not right. Yes, it is. They're getting exactly What they deserve. What about us? We're Suffering through this as well. You're the only one suffering, Lana. Donna and I can handle it. Right? Yes! Why don't you have another drink. To dull my senses? No,To loosen your inhibitions. And make me more accepting of murder. Of revenge. Speaking of revenge... It looks like I see victim number three. Ugh!! Ugh!! Ugh!! Haha.. Ugh! Ugh!! Haha.. Ugh! Ugh!! Ugh!! Oh.. Oh...Oh... Ahh.. Oh.. Ohhh... Ohhh... Oh Yes!!! Ohhh... Ohhh... Oh Yes!!! Ohhh... Ohhh... Oh Yes!!! Ohhh... I see what you mean. It did get better better this time. I...I told you. You there are advantages of using black arts. Lana, are you all right? No...It hurts...It really, really hurts....This... this is so wrong. What they did to my daughter is wrong. Here. Let me help you. How can you help... Lana? Lana? Lana? Ohhh,,, Lana? I think She passed out. Just let her sleep. I think she drank too much. But she had less to drink then ether of us did.. It's better this way. She wasn't enjoying the process. It's like when you take acid for the first time. You can have a great trip or other times it's a really bad one. It's the same way with the black arts. What was that? What was what? Your eyes. Are you wearing contacts? Oh that's nothing. It's just a side effect of the power. The more you use the black arts, the more they uses you. I can handle it. Handle what! Don't worry about it. You'll understand soon enough. Ohhh, it looks like our doll is about to strike again. Ohhhh... Yes!!!!! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ohhhh... Yes!!!!! His death...It's so...so intense. Ohh... Tell me about it. I get so hot during these spells, That I just want to dive right into that pool But I can't because I would ruin our view. I am just going to go inside the house for some water and I will be right back. LANA, LANA, Are you alright? Don...Donna. What's happening? Nothing, You just fell asleep. It's okay. No, I didn't...Tina...Tina did something to me. She's been corrupted by the power....She's evil. No she isn't. She's ok . She's just a little into it. No, we're in danger. There's a Is a price to pay for what we're doing... There always is. Oh, hello. Hello, Hey.. You must be Mel, Lana's son. Ya that's me. And you are...? Tina Lewis. An old friend of your mother's. Back during her wild college days. Wild my mom? I guess she never told you the stories. No, she didn't. What are you doing? Oh, palm-reading is hobbie of mine. You can learn so much from some one just by reading their palm. You mean like seeing my life line. And there love line Oh wow! What is it? You're still a virgin. You cannot tell that by reading my palm.. Oh yes, I can. Come sit with me for a moment. Ah...Where's my mom? Oh She's out by the pool. Don't worry about her. Would you like a drink, Mel?

You didn't? Oh, whew! That's a relief. No, no, no. I meant I never had a virgin sacrifice before. Huh? What? Killing you will give me incredible power. And the Dark Lord always requires a sacrifice. for services rendered. Ohh.. Uhhhh Ohh. I...I can't take anymore. It's not just killing them. It's killing me too! What are you talking about? It's so beautiful. Kill the last one quickly! No We got to put a stop to this. Where is Tina? She inside some Where? Come with me. Where? Inside we got to put a end to this.. No!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!! Get away from my son. He has been chosen. Like hell he has! That's what I said. What...? What is this? How is this possible? You're not the only one who kept up on her practices after college. What is going on? The Black arts require a payment. A sacrifice has to be given to the Dark One. And she was going to give him my son. I told you she's gone bad. No. That's not what I wanted. I just wanted revenge. Revenge requires a payment. Someone has to die. That's how this works. But not Lana's son. Then who? It's either him or one of us. Donna ,Don't give in,. Fight it. Don't let her corrupt your soul. That's what she was after all along. She has gone over to the dark side. She's right. It was your idea to start this in the first place. Ya And now I'm going to finish it. Where's the knife? No! Don't take him. Take me! Take me! Take me! As you wish! Uh...Uh... Uh...

Then what's that clown doll doing on your shoulder? Ahhhh..... It's so good to see you again. It's been like... Twenty years. All I heard was that it was a college hazing prank! Ya, It happened one year ago today. Donna what did you find? A video was shot the night that Justine died. I've been fine-tuning my abilities over the years. We are conjuring a demon, Donna. Demons? That sounds like black magic. Ugh!! The Dark Lord always requires a sacrifice. Ohhh!! Ahhh! Ahhh! Uhh!
