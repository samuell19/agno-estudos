Roy, Roy! What's wrong, Maggie, what's the matter? Come on, honey. No, no! Come on, sweetheart. Come on. Here you are, boys. Hey! Hey, let's get the hell out of here. Maggie! Maggie! You heard my buddy, shut up. Let's go. Here, take these. Jess! Here, let me have it. That's not the way to win, Johnny. To hit the mark just takes a little practice, Johnny. Just like everything else. Johnny, did you finish polishing the glasses for me? First, we thank the lord for the morning. Then we clean the church. Then he can Polish your glasses. Sick grapes make sour wine. You think you could teach me how to shoot a gun sometime? Johnny, I don't think I remember very well. Then why do you keep that gun in the drawer? It's not mine. I'm holding it for somebody. It's Lewis' gun, isn't it? That's right. I sure wish you could tell me about him. I heard he was one of the best shots around. Maybe. And maybe there was one better. If I ever meet Lewis, I'll have him teach me how to shoot a gun. I don't think you're gonna meet him. Down in Mexico somewhere. Is there a chance he's dead? I hardly think so. You want a drink, stranger? Well, that'll do me for a start. Hi. Hi. They call me chesty. No kidding. You know, Jess, I think I'm gonna like this place. Lookie here. Jess. Thank you... chesty. Oh, yes, chesty. How about letting someone else play for a while. They're real polite around here. Yeah, there's a lot of ammunition. Johnny. Johnny, come here. Hey, boy. Now, what are you doing here? Why the hell ain't you in school? It's my saloon. You see, ask a stupid question and... And you get an answer. Where's your father? He's dead. Killed in a gunfight. Well, that's too bad. Wasn't fast enough with his gun, huh? He was too fast. So they shot him in the back. Who shot him? I don't know. Happened before I was born. Johnny. I told you to come here. She's not bad, huh? Yeah. I think we're gonna have ourselves a good time here. Now, ain't we, chesty? That's up to you, stranger. Hot damn! This is a respectable place, mister. You ask for whiskey and that's what you get. Just whiskey. This is wild man's milk, madam. And mighty fine, too. I don't think you heard me. I said this is a respectable place. Yes, ma'am, I hear you. Get down. I hear you now. This is a respectable place. Boy, not you too. I fold. See you. Royal flush. One of you get the sheriff. No, we don't need a sheriff, ma'am, we need a preacher. It was a case of self-defense, everybody saw it was a case of self-defense. Right, fellows? Yeah, right. Yeah, right. Sure, it was. Somebody go get the sheriff. Johnny. No, Jess. Now, please, ma'am, I thought you said this was a respectable joint. Father. Father. Johnny, what happened? Judge, judge. Those are the same men who held up the bank in crane city. They also molested a young girl there. Go home. And not only in crane city, but also in Maverick, Normandy and spotsberg. Not to mention Dryden. What do we do, judge? Go call the sheriff. You cowards, cowards. A man has been killed and all you do is stand around. Isn't there anybody in this town with guts enough to do something about it? A man's been killed, murdered right here in the saloon. I thought we were supposed to have a sheriff in this town. Judge Barrett. Sheriff, why don't you go after them? Are you gonna let them get away with this? You can't let them get away. Jenny, those men are gone. Judge Barrett, something has to be done. This man was killed. He was murdered by the Claytons. The Claytons, they have to be stopped. They have to be arrested. Do you know the Claytons? Listen, sheriff, I... Jenny, take it easy. I'm glad those people are gone, I don't want any more trouble in this town. And going after them would just mean risking the lives of all these people. But they must be punished. "Mine is the vengeance," "saith the lord." Take your boy outside. Sheriff, I wanna borrow your horse. For what? I got some business to take care of. Father. Now, why don't you stay the hell out of this? The Claytons are a very rough bunch, and I don't want any more of them in this town. Well... I suppose you'd better take this. Now, you people listen to me. Anything happens to this town, the responsibility is his. Sorry for this. Sorry to destroy your slumber, gentlemen. Well, boys, look who we got here. The local soul-savior himself. And what can we do for you, father? Spit it out, father. What the hell do you want? Now, damn it, Jess, them's plain bad manners. Please, please sit down, father. We're always available for a good confession. Zeke, pour some coffee for our guest here. I came to return your nephew's property, Clayton. I'm asking you to come back to Juno city with me. The judge is waiting for you. I have the other one, too. I wouldn't try it, if I were you. Yeah, Jess, he's right. That man is right, don't try it. Now, that voice... That voice rings a bell, is it possible that we have met before? I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Let's go, young man, I don't wanna miss my morning mass. Well, father, I'm afraid you're just gonna have to miss it. So the holy man don't travel alone. Jess, I I think you better go along with him. Oh, yeah. He's all yours, father. Thanks for the horse, sheriff. Damn it, I smell trouble. Now, him, I don't understand. He founded this community, this Christian community as a peaceful, law-abiding place. Sheriff, why not call the marshal? Don't take on the responsibility by yourself. Yeah, let's try the telegraph. You're late for morning mass, father. Better late than not at all. Well, Johnny. And where were you last night? You didn't put out the candles. Go ring the bell, young man. I thought you didn't know how to use a gun. How did you know it was me? Did you put it back? Hi, Tom. Hi. Judge. This food is slop. It's not fit for the horses. In a few hours, it won't matter. You'll be hanging from a rope. I'll piss on your grave before I hang from a rope. You tell that to your sheriff, huh? Don't, I wanna watch the jerk hang. Get it? I'll keep the keys safe till the morning. You check later with the sheriff. Come on. Come on, get the guns. Inside the bench. Bench. Listen, I told the judge I was gonna piss on his grave and I'm a man of my word. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, let's get the priest first. Why not get them both, huh? Come on. Hold it, hold it. Sam says wait till sunrise, we wait. Come on. Go back to sleep, huh? Good morning, father. Beautiful morning. Mom said you did a great job the other night. With god's help. And yours too, Johnny. Father, father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Johnny. Down in Mexico somewhere. No, please, let me go. Please. Hi, honey. Hey. Take a look what's happening now. Things is taken a change for the better. The judge is on our side. From now on, I'm the law in Juno city. Judge Barrett, Jess Clayton killed a man in my saloon and now father John's dead, too. Now, listen, sweetheart. Now, we came for Jess 'cause he is innocent. Now, everybody knows it was a case of self-defense. Now, ain't that right, judge? Ain't that right, judge? But what about the priest, huh? Who killed him? Have you forgotten about him already? What the hell was that? You don't mean to tell me there are horse thieves in this town. Horse thieves? Yeah, horse thieves. Sam, that little blond kid. He just took two of our horses. Johnny, Johnny. You know, that's how I got started, too? Yeah? Stealing horses? Yeah, stealing horses. Go on, go get him. The little bastard. Sheriff! Sheriff! Let me go. Somebody has to call the marshal in comstock, do you hear me? Well, now, listen, honey, that telegraph is broken. Isn't that right, sheriff? You bastard. Me? Come on. That little bastard thinks he outsmarted us. Take care of the horse there, I'll go after him. We found one horse. Rip's still out there, looking for the kid. Where is he? I want to go. Shut up, will you? Let me go. Get her out of here. Unless we can get that kid, he can cause us a lot of trouble. Mike's right. Let's divvy up and pull out. Well, that's fine with me, I don't care what the hell you do. Zeke, give him his share. Rest of it stays in the family. Zeke? Now, look. We got those plans to stay here and wait for that stagecoach to Stockton and we are gonna stick to our plans. A chest full of gold. This here will do me just fine. Yeah, and the stagecoach is all yours, too. Now, you heard what the man said. That boy could cause a lot of trouble. I'd better take a look. Oh! What's happening with our sheriff? He's been well taken care of. Yeah. Got ourselves a good caretaker, huh? I cannot read. You don't understand, do you? Manuel here is mute, chico. He don't like you make bad jokes. You go south, muchacho. You don't find anything till you come to iglesia destruida in one mile. Then nothing for two more miles till pueblo guerrado, where the americano Lewis is living. Hey, muchacho, you are loco to run in this heat. They're beautiful. Who are they? The sheriff's daughters? No, they're not his. Mine. He's their uncle. How could such a ugly sob have two pretty daughters like that, huh? I love them. Please. Don't do any harm to them. Harm? You must be kidding, old timer. You know something? I love them as well. And I'm gonna tell you just how much. Them, too. Hello, what are you looking for? Hey, what's wrong? My name is Juanita. Who are you? What is it? Why don't you talk? You have a dry throat. Come, sit down. Now, is that better? You can talk now, no? You mean, you don't want to? You don't want to talk? Or you can't? My father's coming. Maybe he can get you to say something. What's the matter with you? You look like you've seen a ghost. You could use a meal, a bath and a bed. A bath first, come on. Well... I think I'll be heading on back. We'll cross the frontier in the morning. So we'll camp here for the night. Yeah. Well, enjoy your money. Don't spend it all in one place. All right, Sam. Thanks. Gonna last a long time. I think I'll take a look up there. See you around. So long, Sam. So long. Thanks for everything. So long. Rip. I may be crippled all my life. But I'll be rich. What the hell happened? I got duped by that goddamn kid. But now, it's your turn. Well, if you're crippled, you'll never make it alone. You'll rot here. I can help you. Oh, no. Here, here's your money. I don't trust you anymore. You don't trust me? Look, I only got two shells in my gun. Here. Now it's empty. Now, you can trust me. Are you going to shoot me? Well, if you want to shoot me, go ahead. Shoot me in the legs, go ahead, right here. Shoot me, then we'll be even. No, no, wait. Don't want to see it. I don't understand. You still don't talk. Is something bothering you? Or maybe it's a secret. Something you don't want to say in front of my daughter. Well, don't worry, I don't have any secrets from Juanita. You know, kid. I can go along with a man who doesn't run off at the mouth too much but... At least you can tell me your name. My name is Johnny. Johnny. Mute. Father. My brother sent you? He must have had a lot of faith in you to trust you with this. What's wrong, Johnny? Don't you feel good? Father. Where? When? No! Father, look. In front of the church. Four bullets or four men? Who did it, Johnny? Isn't there a sheriff in Juno city? When did it happen? Two? Two days? Listen, you are not thinking of going there are you? But he's dead. Well, there's nothing anybody can do. Your going there won't help. You might end up dead, too. And what I know, he wouldn't have wanted that. I have to go. Try and understand, Juanita. I've got to live with myself, I've got to go. You were born with that? Oh, happened when my brother... When we were kids, our father taught us how to shoot. The position of the sun, the direction of the wind. Stance. A hundred or more times a day, we'd practice, in and out of the holster. John practiced so much, he wore out dozens of holsters. Nobody could beat John to the draw. Then one day, god put a Bible in his hands instead of a gun. My story? It's a bit different. It happened in a gambling house, in Abilene. That was my other life, a long time ago. It was self-defense, sheriff. Self-defense. Lewis caught him cheating, he had these aces up his sleeve. Wherever you are, it seems there is always trouble. Chet has some mean friends in this town. I think it's high time you left. Lewis, everyone in Abilene has laid a bet on you. All their savings. If we dust you off, there won't be one person in this town to put flowers on your grave. So we thought we'd bring you some, just in case. How do you do, sir? I'm... my name is Mortimer. And I want to thank you, sir. I'm really indebted to you. You see, well, what I mean is... I bet all my savings on you. And thanks to you, sir, I'm a very rich man now. An amazingly rich man. And all because of you. I want to thank you, sir. Go get your hat, mister. And don't forget your gun. There're lot of bad people around here. Yes. John. Five men, Lewis. Five men dead. They asked for it. I've never shot an innocent man. God judges men. How can you decide whether a man is innocent or not in a fifth of a second? What are you trying to say? It's time you stopped. Stopped and do what? Hang up my gun, I'm dead in an hour. Leave. Leave? What do you mean? Leave and go where? Where you can start a new life. The only life I know is this. So I listened to my brother, and my life has been different. But now, I must do what I feel is right. A bunch of men on horses coming this way. Posse. Where? About two miles out. I'm getting out of here. Sam said stay put. I ain't going to swing from no rope. Hey, you ain't going to swing. You haven't got a head on your shoulders. They can't outsmart the Claytons. Hey, Jess, see... Remember that place? Dryden. Dryden? Dryden. You mean the judge's daughters, huh? So the sheriff didn't telegraph the marshal, huh? You know, you're a liar, judge. A double-crossing liar. Sheriff. Sheriff! Now, go out there and get rid of them. If you want me to treat your daughter like a gentleman. Go on. Marshal, it's me, judge Barrett. Hand over Jess Clayton, judge. When the sheriff saw you weren't coming, he decided not to keep him here. He took him to fort Stockton. Damn it! You hear that? After three days riding, we find him handed over to the army. Let's go after him anyway. I want to hang him myself. You're a very smart man. Clayton always keeps his word. I think I'm going to get her sister. It's high time we all had some fun. Come on, let's go to the saloon. Yeah, let's go. Come on. Come on, Jess. Good idea! No! No! No! Animals! Animals! Animals! We did it. God damn it, I told you, we did it. We had ourselves a kind of a rough day, didn't we? Now, let's have some fun. I promise you... Hey! Come on boys, there's enough women for everyone. Get them open! Get them open! No! Now, where are you going? All right. Leave me alone! Darling. No! Get the dress up. Nice ones! Nice. Hold her feet down, there. Get off me! Got me a little hellcat. Oh, right in it. If this is what you want then come and get it. Listen here. Help! Listen. Don't grab the lizard. Lower and slower. Get away from... Sam Clayton, look at me, look at me. Don't you recognize me? I'm the mother of your son. I'm the mother of your son. That's a goddamn crazy woman we got here. I ain't got no son, everybody knows I ain't got no son. Go on, Jess, have your fun. It's the truth, Sam Clayton. Yeah, yeah. Sure, it's the truth. Hey, you really are a crazy woman! Your son. What the hell are you talking about? What is this mother-of-my-son story? What the hell are you talking about? Get out of here, goddamn it! Who are you? Don't you remember? A long time ago, in Dryden. What the hell... Dryden? Yes. ♪ when Johny come marching home again ♪ ♪ hoorah! Hoorah! ♪ ♪ when Johny come marching home again ♪ ♪ hoorah! Hoorah! ♪ I'll never forget that day. Good lord. You were... yes. You mean Johnny... I mean... Why not? I... Why not? Johnny boy. I got a son! I got a son. Hey, curly... curly, Zeke. Zeke, I got a son! I got a... I got a... I got a... I got a son! I got a son of a gun, like me! You know, I'm beginning to like him already. He's got guts. Pulled a fast one on his old man out there. I gotta find him. I got to find Johnny. I gotta find my son! Johnny. It's time to spread god's word. And I won't need that. And I want you to help me, the way you helped my brother. Come on, get out of here, all of you. Come on, out. Out! Get out! Hey, frank. Go get the money! What about the stagecoach? I said go get the money. Johnny! I know you're out there some place, now, come on. It's me, it's your pa... No, don't say that. Don't let Johnny know you're his father. He's the only thing I have. I tried to raise him to be a good boy, and if he finds out, it'll destroy him. Shut up. Johnny's my son, he's my son, and he takes after me. Alone out there in the desert, he fooled three of my best men and almost killed one of them. Oh, he's a Clayton, all right. He's got my blood in his veins. He's the only good thing I got in my rotten life. Sam, please, I beg of you, don't take him away from me. Shut up! Oh, my god! He's come back, he's come back. Who's come back? Who's come back? The priest. The priest! Come on. Let's go. He fell because he was drunk. Zeke, get the money. Get back. Go on, red, behind the wagon. Sam! The money's not there. Red, you go see what's happening. You too, Jess. Stay there. No! No! Johnny! What do you think you're doing? I told you I didn't need that. Come on out of there. Do you hear me, boy? Come on out or I'll kill your mother. I mean it, Johnny. Oh, Johnny. Johnny, get up on a horse. Zeke, come on. Let's go! Come on, Zeke, let's go. I want that money. Don't be a fool, let's go. Well, girls. I think it's all over. Sam! Sam! Sam! Hold it! Hold it or I'll fire, I'll kill you. Hold it! Take a drink. Go ahead. Now, you, I'm going to hang you at the end of a rope. Move your ass. Move it! Hey, old buddy, not too far from the border now. Hey, brother George, why the heck are we going to Mexico? Why? Well, Willy, 'cause back there, there's nothing but death and destruction, and in Mexico, there's gold, silver and those lovely brown-skinned girls. Sure glad I asked. Come on. Wait! That's where we're going. Johnny! Johnny! Look up there, Johnny. You know what those crosses are? This is an old abandoned mission, and that's the cemetery. I got a surprise for you. Come on. You know, Johnny, some people are born poor as church mice. And others are... Others are rolling in money. Now, look here. Look what we got. We got $50,000, Johnny. All ours, kid. Yeah. $50,000, all in one pile. Bet you've never seen so much money, have you? We gonna enjoy the rest of our lives together, Johnny. Look. It's all ours. You know, Johnny, out there is Mexico. I always wanted to go there someday. In Mexico, maybe... Maybe somewhere down near the sea. Yeah. But I always kept putting it off, and you know why? Yeah, I'll tell you why, Johnny. I'll tell you why, it was because... Because of my nephews. Zeke and then Jess and then red, none of them... They wouldn't agree. And listen, I'll tell you something. I ain't getting no younger. Time just goes by and then... Then one day... One day you just get older, and suddenly you find yourself all alone. You deserve to be alone. You shut up. You shut... She don't know nothing, Johnny. She don't understand. Father John was my brother. "Mine is the vengeance," "saith the lord." Here. Here. Look. It's yours. Here. Here, it's all yours. All $50,000. It's yours. It's all yours. You understand? $50,000. I got some more in this bag here. No. Thank you. Johnny. You take care of that, Johnny. Lewis! I'll put the gun back in the church.
