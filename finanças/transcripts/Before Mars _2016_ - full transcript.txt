MAN [ON COMM]: Launch team. Launch team. Be advised. Stay at your consoles. T-minus-10 seconds. YOUNG HANA: Can I ask you a question? WOMAN: Of course. Go ahead. YOUNG HANA: Do you ever miss home? MAN [ON COMM]: Three, two, one. LILY: Hana. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Joon. Thanks. LILY: Almost at the new house, guys. Home sweet home. Come on, girls. Joon, that one goes with me into the kitchen. Hana, take that upstairs into your room. Um, what are you doing? I wanna see what's up there. Pass me that box. No way. It smells like old people up here. Kylie once said she found a dead body in an attic. HANA: Really? JOON: That's what she told me. [STATIC HUMMING] What's that? So it says here that these are frequencies. It also says here it's illegal to operate a ham radio... ...without a license. WOMAN [ON RADIO]: This is November-Alpha... [STATIC HISSING] This is November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra. Do you copy? I saw that written in here. November... Hello? [DISTORTED] If you can follow... Hello? [STATIC HISSING] - Are you okay? - Calling... ...for an emergency... It'll probably work better outside. November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra. November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra. Hello? MAN [ON RADIO]: Tiny little bits of rain again tomorrow, but still some rainfall around. And then on Sunday, mainly, but until Monday, that's... Hana, are you ready to go? ...and thunderstorms our way. Starting as early as Saturday night. So we're gonna see a windy day Sunday, we'll see some showers and thunderstorms... Joon, hurry up! - We're gonna be late. - ...possible. Monday could also-- [INDISTINCT CHATTER] We have to get rid of these lunches. They smell horrible to other people. But I'm hungry. GIRL: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be laughing. I shouldn't be laughing. But it's so funny. Let's go sit with those girls. I don't know. Come on. It's not a big deal. You go ahead. [SIGHS] Fine. Wish me luck. - She'll have friends. - Okay. One plum sauce day... ...isn't gonna ruin your life. Hi. I'm Joon. I'm new here. GIRL: I'm Christine. - Did you see Mr. K today? - Yeah. I think he has a wig. Really? I didn't even notice. So that girl Christine invited me over. Do you wanna come? HANA: Maybe next time. Okay. Well, tell Mom I'll be home before dinner. You know how she gets. [STATIC HUMMING] MAN [ON RADIO]: There's a series of high speed-- MAN: Hey! What are you doing with my truck? Uh... Nothing. Sorry. Hey, you all right? Why are you sitting out here with the trash? Uh... No reason. Well, you hungry? [BLUES MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Carl, how many times do I have to tell you, you can't keep your dentures on the table? It's only soup. WOMAN: It's common sense. Pretty exciting stuff, ain't it? I still remember when they launched a monkey into space. 1948. He was catapulted into that black abyss that floats over us. And he never came back. WOMAN: Here, Dad. Don't forget to take these. But in that moment... ...the little chimp became a space pioneer. For future monkeys, like us. Ignore him. Pancakes are the secret for a long life. My mom says ginseng is. Doesn't sound as delicious as pancakes. She says it cures everything from colds to heartbreak. [STATIC HISSING] What's that? Oh. It's just this old radio I found. I haven't seen this model for ages. - You know about these things? - Know about these things? I'm old. Of course I know about these things. Oh, and there's this notebook with all these codes in it. There's this one I heard on the radio. November-Alpha-1... Sierra-Sierra. Yeah. How did you know? Well... ...you are talking to that black abyss that the monkey led us to. Space? Space. I'm not sure if this is working. ALBERT: The new antenna should be helping. Try it again. [STATIC HISSING] HANA: November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra. Do you copy? - Daniel looks like Jack. He's blond. - Really? - And he has-- I think he has blue eyes. HANA: November-Alpha... But he's cuter, and they're brothers. Maybe we calculated the time of day wrong. What is she doing now? JOON: Um... I'm not actually sure. November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra, do you copy? MADISON: I think she made contact. [CLICKS] That picture's awesome. Heh. CHRISTINE: Send it to me. MADISON: Okay. HANA: November-Alpha-1-Sierra... [BLUES MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO] LILY: Joon? - Joon, where were you? - Out. - What do you mean out? With who? - It's Friday night. - Were you smoking? - No! LILY: You reek of cigarettes. Mom. Dinner's ready. [RADIO CLICKS OFF] Hello there. So I have this new antenna design we can try. That was the Dayton Hamvention. 1997. That was a good year. Um... I've been thinking, and you should have this. Well, I have one already. I'll just leave it here, then. I'm becoming the weird kid at school. You know who was weird? Einstein was weird. Picasso. Mozart. A bunch of weirdoes. You know, you remind me a lot of my daughter... ...when she was your age. You may not see it now, but one day when you look back... ...you'll be grateful for being weird. Let's try this new antenna. So if I go to a more open clearing, I can get a better connection. Exactly. The trees and buildings around here... ...are obstructing the signal as the International Space Station passes by. There's only a short window of time to make the connection. 7:03 p.m... ...pointing upward, following a northeastern path. [SIGHING] There. [RADIO CLICKING] [SIGHS] Let me try it. Why are you hitting it like that? Back in the day when our electronics malfunctioned... ...we'd give them a good old-fashioned whack. MAN [ON RADIO]: ...weather station partly sunny. Temperature 86. Mostly sunny skies. Temperature 82. Wind south at 5 miles an hour. Temperature 86. What would you ask the astronauts on the ISS? I think I'd ask them... ...how it looks from out there. ALBERT: In the great framework of things... ...a life is only a fraction of a second... ...in a universe that's almost 14 billion years old. I'd like to hear from someone outside of everything. Oh, my God. Someone who understands what really matters. - Hi, Katie. I'm Lily. - Hi. BOTH: Nice to meet you. LILY: I've left a list of phone numbers and emergency contacts beside the TV. And here is money for pizza tonight. Where--? I'm gonna get my keys. Let me guess. You must be Joon. Hana. Darn. Well, I had a 50 percent chance. Joon is working on a science project until about 5 tonight. Call me if you need anything. Hana, I'm working a double tonight on the base. I'll be home in the morning. You girls be good, all right? [POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] I wonder how many animals died to make this coat. CHRISTINE: Oh, my goodness. Picture. - Two. - All right, let me see how it looks. - Okay. CHRISTINE: Hashtag "hotstuff." MADISON: Yeah, I know. I wish my mom would let me get a cell phone. Yeah, my mom's all right like that. But she checks it, like, every day so I have to delete everything. - You don't have a phone? JOON: No. MADISON: That sucks. CHRISTINE: Yeah, it does. Hana would love this. CHRISTINE: Oh, my gosh. You look exactly like your sister. I would put that down. CHRISTINE: What do you think? Super cute. I would get it. - It's $18. - You can't afford that. What are you doing? What? It's no big deal. It's just a shirt. Besides... ...I can totally outrun that guy. It's not a big deal. We do it all the time. You know there are security cameras everywhere, right? Come on! [LAUGHING] Oh! Hey. You must be Joon. - Yeah. - I'm Katie, your babysitter. - Uh, Hana's upstairs, if you wanted to know. - Thanks. Great. JOON: Hana? Albert, do you copy? [STATIC HISSES] ALBERT [ON RADIO]: Hana? - It's Hana. Will you be by your radio tonight? Of course. Over. Over and out. JOON [ON RADIO]: Hello? Joon? Hana? Where did you get a ham radio? I found one at a thrift store. It was supposed to be for you. Where are you anyway? I'm trying to get a better signal. So I'm going to the top of the mountain. Um... Why? There's just someone I really have to talk to. How can I help? - Do you see a telephone pole near you? - Yeah. There should be a hiking path that starts there. I found it. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Hana? Did you hear how loud that thunder was? I mean... Where's Hana? Uh, she's not feeling well. - She's been in the bathroom for a while. [CELL PHONE JINGLING] Oh, all right. I hadn't seen her for a little bit... ...so got a little worried. Hello. Yeah. No, no. We-- We haven't lost power yet. [KATIE CHUCKLES] Hana, are you there? Hana. Hana. Are you there? All right, jig's up. I know one of you isn't here. She's in the basement. I'm calling your mother. Come on. Albert? Joon? Hello? [STATIC HISSING] KATIE: Your mom's gonna kill me. How do you lose a kid? [CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] LILY: Joon! Where's your sister? [STATIC HISSING] Really, Joon? Why up the mountain? She wanted a better connection to talk to the space station. Why the space station? Turn left up here. Albert? [STATIC HISSING] ALBERT [ON RADIO]: Hana. Are you all right? A little soaked from the storm, but I'm all right. Go to frequency 144.49. Joon? Do you copy? Hello? Joon, are you there? Hana? I'm here with Mom. Hana? You're grounded. For the rest of the year. I know. Mom, I gotta go. And I promise I'll get home soon. Just tune in to frequency 144.49. Okay? November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra, do you copy? [STATIC HUMMING] November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra, do you copy? November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra, do you copy? WOMAN [ON RADIO]: This is November-Alpha-1-Sierra-Sierra. I hear you loud and clear, aboard the International Space Station. Over. Hi, this is Hana Seung. Can I ask you a question? Of course. Go ahead. What does the Earth look like from way up there? WOMAN: It's bright and colorful. Hopeful. It looks like home. - Do you ever miss home? - I do. I think about it a lot. As a kid... ...I really struggled to find where I fit in the world. I feel like that sometimes too. For me, I just had to change my perspective. And now, whenever I think of the word "home"... ...I don't think of a place. I think of my family. Of my mother. Of my sister. It took me years to realize that home can change over time. That it isn't a destination, nor a location. MAN [ON COMM]: T-minus-10 seconds. WOMAN [ON RADIO]: And once you find that place... ...home is anywhere you make it. MAN [ON COMM]: Three, two, one.
