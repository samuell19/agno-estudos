TOWARDS THE DREAM (aka ENCOUNTER IN SPACE) Odessa Film Studio Production Screenplay: A. Berdnik, I. Bondin, M. Karyukov Camera: A. Gerasimov Music composers: Vano Muradeli and Edward Artemiev Directed by: Mikhail Karyukov, Otar Koberidze Cast: This is our planet. From a distance it's like an ordinary school globe. Let's look through the clouds. We won't ask the city's name or of the scientific center on the shore of a warm blue sea. Fishermen and poets, schoolboys and academicians, astronomers and cosmonauts... Today is Sunday, and everyone is spending it their own way. Computer center operator...Paul. He's a chess player, who's never lost to his friend Andrey. Andrey specializes in space mechanics, writes songs and dreams of remote stars. He believes the stars are inhabited. Ivan Batalov...engineer and amateur painter. He sketches friends in his album. This restrained man of few words is nicknamed "Commander" by his friends. Academician Krylov...head astronomer, compiler of the star atlas. Today he meets with his foreign colleague, Dr. Laungton. They have an old debate... What would probably happen if earthmen and aliens met? I. S. Shklovsky: "The Universe. The Life. The Mind." Tanya...radio-astronomer. She listens to the mysterious voices of far away stars. Today she's recorded strange signals from space. What if these are the signals Earth's been waiting on for all these years? Hurry to Andrey... - Give me your hand! - Stop laughing, Andrey, I'm serious. What if they're really signals coming from another world? Look out, Tanya! - Have you really never thought about it? - Never thought about it. - Never...? - No. No? What was the device you showed Paul? Device? It's just a crystalphone. Show me? Nothing interesting... just dreams in my spare time. Well... I won't ask you anymore. Are you serious? Okay, here...listen. "Living and believing is wonderful." "We have unheard of voyages in the future." "Cosmonausts and dreamers say" "that apple trees will be in flower on Mars." "It's good when friends are with you." "It's easier to travel across the entire universe." "Stars will meet the Earth in flower," "and apple trees will be in flower on Mars." Overcoming endless space distances, the Earth song reaches the planet Centuria, and the greatest and most beautiful thing in the universe happens... people of one planet hear the voice of another planet. "I became a friend of distant stars." "Don't worry about me and don't be sad." "While leaving Earth we promised" "that apple trees would be in flower on Mars." "While leaving Earth we promised" "that apple trees would be in flower on Mars." But what feeling has the song evoked in their hearts? Fear or joy? What if they challenge Earth? Those are Dr. Laungton's thoughts...a hostile challenge. No...such thinking is only for those who don't believe in the power of mind. Centuria's scientists have known that the Earth is inhabited. And they decide to fly... Just fly. But the people of Earth didn't expect guests from outer space. - I flew to the moon, and you'll fly to Mars. - There's a lack of water on Mars...no cocktails. Drink. Just for you, gourmet, pikes will be bred in Martian puddles. You're absolutely right. Only in case Crucian carps are there. Crucian carps? Attention! All cosmonauts except those under observation in thermo and isolation chambers, please assemble at Gagarin Square. Attention! All cosmonauts except those under observation in thermo and isolation chambers, please assemble at Gagarin Square. - Ivan, will we fly? - Possibly, but our routes could be different. Hey, guys, hurry up! Like in the song: The order is given... He should move to Phobos. She should move in the opposite direction. Sergey Petrovich has arrived. Come on. They only send newly married couples together. Think about it. Friends, I'm happy to tell you alarming and, at the same time, remarkable news. We've just received structured signals from space. This proves the theories of modern scientists. Sergey Petrovich, it's probably an accidental coincidence. No, my friends. The signals are getting progressively stronger. At the moment, decoding machines are trying to decipher this enigmatic symphony of radiation. The eyes and ears of Earth are focused on the supposed source of the signal. This is from the International Cosmo Center. At 17:18, satellite observatories detected an unidentified spaceship. It has crossed the moon's orbit and is moving towards Earth. Our computers are calculating the possible landing site. But why have the signals stopped now? - This is really puzzling... - Yes... We should just answer! Incomprehensible. It all looks like some... fantastic fiction. Earth excitedly awaits the crossing of its orbit with the aliens' orbit. What will happen? A giant explosion that burns all life on Earth, or Earth, augmented by alien intelligence, blossoms and becomes more beautiful... becoming the planet of the "Companionship of Suns?" But to earthmen's surprise, only a small star falls in the sea, leaving a strange object. What has this amazing delegate from space brought to Earth? Pyotr Timofeyevich, what's happening? It's their ship's video log. The cabin can be clearly seen. Send Krylov to me. Play it. They were traveling to us. But why? I suppose that a civilization capable of overcoming interstellar distances could have only one purpose... thirst for knowledge. - Are you sure? - Yes. Thirst for knowledge pushed civilized Europeans on to unknown Asia and Africa. That brought us a sea of tears and blood. That was done by people living under one sky. What can we expect from a meeting with another world? That could be an amazing meeting! The meeting could be unpleasant. Sergey Petrovich, we're receiving a lot of inquiries from different countries. I suppose, Sergey Petrovich, we should assemble Congress. Yes, a lot of difficulties... almost unresolvable tasks... Should we declare our inability to solve this, and leave in disgrace? No, ladies and gentlemen. Faced with a real opportunity to establish friendship between different worlds, when inhabitants of another planet have taken the first steps to do this, we should take steps to answer. Even if they didn't ask for help. I don't believe this meeting is the risk. The risk resides elsewhere... the risk that we are too late to help. Mr. Laungton, you're welcome to speak. Dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with astonishment to this interesting but absolutely fantastic speech from President Krylov. What the respected president said is romantic and beautiful, but impossible. Our automated scouts have reached Mars and Venus. It's obvious that the civilizations of neighboring planets could interpret that as an attempt to conquer circumsolar space. I stress, dear colleagues, that I would be happy if I'm wrong. These aren't the thoughts of a scientist, but a politician. Not a scientist? Perhaps, but a human who wishes to defend his home, which is also your home. And whom will you send to meet uncertainty on a foreign planet? People who love their planet. These are the thoughts of a dreamer, not a scientist. To do this would require leaping over centuries of technological progress. Why not try? We could unite our planet's intellect and science, gather together everything needed. ...and finding money, Mr. Laungton. Who can believe our powerful planet, which just spent billions on militarization, can not. Fly! We should fly! Absolutely! He's right, Mr. Laungton. We cosmonauts are ready to fly to Mars. Crashed in the area of Mars, cosmonauts of Centuria transmitted an SOS not to Russians or Americans, not Frenchmen or Arabs, but addressed it to the whole planet...its collective mind! Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen, spaceship OCEAN, made by the nations of our world, was to be launched in half a year during an advantageous arrangement of planets. But the situation has now changed. We should fly at once at maximum speed. But it's impossible without rush delivery of large amounts of resources to the moon. Despite a difference of opinions, Earth's people decide to go. Scores of shuttles travel to the moon to deliver supplies for spaceship OCEAN which is ready to fly to Mars. "We are leaving our home planet, to spread the truth of Earth," "through stars and planets, flying faster than the speed of light." "To make it possible for Earth to sound everywhere a long-anticipated signal." "I am Earth. I will never forget my children," "sons and daughters." "Fly to the sun and hurry to return home." "We will fly to the sun and will hurry to return home." "Our purposes are high and distant." "Ancestors who helped Earth to be beautiful are with us on our star way." "So let the commander's orders and mother's instructions sound for us and them." "I am Earth. I will never forget my children," "sons and daughters." "Fly to the sun and hurry to return home." "We will fly to the sun and will hurry to return home." So what about a response from Mars? Silent, no life signs. - So we should be looking for...? - Yes... No. No sign of life. No sign... Nothing. Attention! Earth calling the commander of cargo spaceship RDU-12. I repeat! Earth calling the commander of cargo spaceship RDU-12. I got it! Look. - Lusya, when? - The Earth channel is busy. - My order? - Later. Lusenka, Lake of Dreams please. Guys, don't waste your time. My apologies. I'm new here on the moon. Santos Rem, journalist. I ask you, please. - Unfortunately, all channels are busy, Mr. Rem. - That's predictable. I'll wait. The weather on Earth was beautiful yesterday. You like it? That's for you. What a beauty! That's great for sure, but what is the result of flight Mars-3? Are your conjectures confirmed? Yes, they're confirmed. But lots of aspects are still unclear, and surprises are possible at every step. But we can't wait. Even during times of great events, there are always people for whom a sensational report is more important than the event itself. They're always ready to rush into the middle, and no one knows what questions they'll ask. Why are you flying to Mars? It's worth it to fly there. Ivan, what's happening? Oh, that's Commander. He could help with your newspaper. I am at your service. Excuse me, I have... Commander, it's for my newspaper. What are you flying to Mars for? What for? To return to Earth. And to bring a smile from a different world. Yes, but there's only two of you, and we know that three of you will fly. Who's the third one? Like a drummer friend said: "One more beat and the music's over." Tanyusha, come in. If you're interested in orbital flights... I want... I want... to wish you a happy birthday. Because... You know... I... I know. "He should move to Phobos... " No. Report on our readiness. "OCEAN" "We have passed 75 million km. Mars is the size of a dish from here. What if we... " "RECREATION TIME" Is it lunch already? Even far away from Earth, people still have their usual Earth habits. They miss home, lunch, the green field of a stadium, will joke and argue... The mood of people on a spaceship carries the same weight as on Earth. Let's play? I'm finishing reading "MOON DIARIES" by Krylov. Mars... How will it greet us? - Tanyusha. - Paul, how will we understand each other? There's one language which should be understandable. I'm talking about them. When will you be serious? When I die of hunger, mademoiselle. Don't upset the Martian girls. They're impatiently waiting for you. I know it. But before dying of hunger, I will write a book. A story? A novel? I will write a book about cooking tasty and healthy...space food! What's that? "Food for Gods and Cosmonauts." A gift from a French company. Every pill's nutritional value is like a lamb chop's. Let me see. I know this company. They sell pills, but only for those who leave Earth. Really? Try it. - What's happened to the 2nd block units? Look! The sun! Put on your helmets! An unexpected solar burst has detuned some important instruments. 42,500 to Mars. 42,200... 42,200... Close your visors! I'm switching on units in the 3rd and 7th blocks. Maximum protection. All blocks are working. To the limit! Calculating the star's energy. No! No! To the limit! Okay... 42,200... 42,150... 120... 42,20... 42,00 In only 5 minutes, radio waves deliver Tanya's words to the moon. We're trying to stick to Mars orbit. Only emergency blocks are working. Only emergency blocks... Paul, Tanya. Paul! Tanya! Tanya, Tanyusha... Move something! Ringing in the ears? Weakness... Connections! Paul! Paul. A bandage with ammonia spirits, quickly! Am I alive? Some ringing in my ears... The emergency unit has done its job. Yes. Switch off the UV protection blocks. Now two tasks: Paul...monitor it, and I will inspect our fuel cells. - You see? - Yes. I swear that's the one. Let's check it out. Starship! "OCEAN crossed the orbit of Mars. Intellect wins." "The whole world is watching." "During the 19th orbit around Mars, OCEAN's crew detected a starship." Starship discovered. What will Krylov say? OCEAN lost too much fuel because of damage. So landing on Mars is impossible? Landing is possible, but taking-off is not. So we should speed up the launching of OCEAN-2. And what do they suggest? Mars. A lifeless desert. Did Mars imagine that spaceships from different planets would meet here? Lets go? Spaceship OCEAN transmitting. Watch and listen. We are broadcasting directly from the site of the starship landing. - I will go? - Wait! Paul, stay here. Paul! No response. A few more steps, and Commander will enter the starship. A starship from a far unknown planet... You've overcome long, long distances... For what? What have you brought to us? What mysteries do you hide in your compartments? We believe in good, so we meet you in trust. But Dr. Laungton... what if he is right? OCEAN transmits for Earth and Moon: We've found the starship. There's one dead cosmonaut. There's one dead cosmonaut. I repeat... Only one dead cosmonaut. "One dead cosmonaut was found in the starship. " "Where are the rest of the cosmonauts?" How's it going? I'm trying to find out where the other two could go. OCEAN's crew supposes that the two other Centuria cosmonauts escaped the starship on an emergency ship. We need to launch the satellites around Mars as fast as possible. It's the only way to find them, but OCEAN-2 isn't ready for launch yet. But my METEOR is ready. I will take video satellites and cast them over Mars. And then what? You know that METEOR is fast. Its fuel will run out quickly. You won't be able to return to Earth or land on Mars. No fuel. But I'm not going to land on Mars in METEOR. Have a look. After launching satellites around Mars, I'll land on Phobos, leave METEOR, and land on Mars in an emergency ship. I've thought about it. It's a huge risk. A minor mistake and... Sergey Petrovich, there will be risk in any case. Andrey and I have made all the necessary calculations. Well, call for Andrey. So the second ship leaves the moon to launch satellites into orbit around Mars. They will search for Centuria's lost cosmonauts. OCEAN's crew is waiting. The video satellites are working. Great, guys! Tanya, the visibility is sharp! Now we'll find them, Paul! We'll find them! After launching the surveillance devices, with too little fuel to land on Mars, the cosmonauts approach Phobos, where gravity is far less, and successfully land. Communicate with OCEAN. "Guys, how's Phobos? " It's amazing. Now we're going to observe it. That's not necessary. Let's do it later... You could be late for launching, and could only stay there for a week. Remember, only 32 minutes left to launch. We'll contact you every 5 minutes. In 2 hours we'll be on Mars. Hoping for a warm meeting. Hurry up, we have a wind here... a very strong wind. Be careful. I repeat, we'll contact you every 5 minutes. Ivan, what's that shadow? It's the Centuria cosmonauts! We were looking for them on Mars, but they've landed here on Phobos! METEOR, METEOR, why do you not respond? Answer, METEOR! 17 minutes left to launch, answer! Answer, METEOR! OCEAN is listening for you. Why no response? What's happening? Tanya, give me Vassily. Yes. - Listen, they're on Phobos. - Who are "they"? The cosmonauts from Centuria. One of them is alive. There are three of us now, and the ship takes only two. You understand? Someone must stay on Phobos. - Is there any chance? - Only to wait. To wait? To wait. Wait for how long? Why can't you decide, Ivan? I must stay here. You know it. I've never flown an emergency ship with so much weight. We have no choice. It's not just the cosmonaut. Think of what you're risking... a being from another planet. Don't persist, Ivan. If we're late launching we all die. Don't keep on, Vanya. Emergency ship, where are you? We can't see you. Keep in mind there's a storm... a dust storm all the way up to the equator. - Equator? - Batalov... Yes. Up to the equator. Emergency ship! This is the emergency ship. I'm going to land. Coordinates...coordinates... Please repeat. Please repeat. I'm landing in the area of the starship. Emergency ship, emergency ship, this is OCEAN. Please answer! Please answer! Please answer! Contact with the ship could not be re-established. We can't waste time! This is Batalov. We've landed in the area of the starship. The ship has exploded. Turn on the radio beacon. Roger that. Turning on radio beacon. "The space map navigator is precisely plotting the course for the last time." "Guys, let's sing a song before take-off. We have 14 minutes to go." "My friends, I believe caravans of spaceships will take us from star to star." "Our footprints will be left on dusty paths of distant planets." "Our footprints will be left on dusty paths of distant planets." OCEAN, this is Batalov. Have landed in the area of the starship. Andrey, answer. What's happening? Answer, Andrey, answer... METEOR, answer. "Living and believing is wonderful." "We have unheard of voyages in the future." "Cosmonauts and dreamers say" "that apple trees will be in flower on Mars." "I became a friend of distant stars." "Don't worry about me and don't be sad." "While leaving the Earth we promised" "that apple trees would be in flower on Mars." "While leaving the Earth we promised" "that apple trees would be in flower on Mars." Tanyusha, I hear you. Andrey, so why did you not answer? Why? I thought about Earth. ...about you. I wrote that song for you. Remember it? All that I've done on Earth, Tanya, and what I planned to do... No, don't say that. I don't want your final words. Don't you dare say that. You'll live. You must live! Attention! People of Earth. Turn on your TVs. This is Mars. This is Mars. Now you will see... ...a daughter of a remote star, saved by your kindness and bravery. She's with us and breathes the air of Earth, though born under a different sun. Do you hear us, Mr. Laungton? They've come to us with an open heart! You said that you'd be happy if your expectations were wrong. You were wrong, Mr. Laungton! Be happy! Yes, you shouldn't die. We spent only one hour in Andrey's dreams. But his generation, not in dreams, but in reality, are singing songs for the universe. Are singing new songs and will sing more new songs. Hey, where are you? Andrey, Tanyusha! Come here! You know what happened? Hurry up! Moscow speaking! Moscow speaking! All radio stations of the Soviet Union are working! This is information from the Soviet Union Telegraph Agency! According to the circumsolar space research program, spaceship OCEAN has been launched to Mars. THE END
