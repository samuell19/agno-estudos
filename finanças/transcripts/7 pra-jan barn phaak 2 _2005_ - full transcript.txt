Akkee and Juk, attack from the left. - Sure thing, Sarge. - No problem. Tungkuay and Kla, attack from the right. Okay. Hey, look at this fire. Dan and Mhad can stay upfront. Hey, where's Mhad? Where's he gone? MOH CHERNGMUAY Hello there, my friends. Which friends? Well, you guys. Are you kidding? Who are you? My name's Moh Cherngmuay. I'm Mhad's brother from episode one. Hey! So, where is Mhad? His legs were broken by some gamblers. So he asked me to replace him. How would it be done? Are you as strong as Mhad? Let's have a look. - What the hell are you doing? - Shit. Shit! What should we do? Shoot me. I'm protected by tigers. Oh, shit! I forgot to load. - He forgot to load his gun. - For you. - We'll sort him out. - It's lit. Then let's go! Why are you running? My gun is empty. Amazing. They're special forces. I trained them myself. Great. Where have you been, Captain? You said you'd bring reinforcement. I got lost. - What? You always get lost. - I know. So how's our new friend, Moh? - He has good skills. - "Good"? He nearly got us killed. Let's kick his ass. - No! - No, stop fighting. I have a new mission for you. You dare disobey my order? Don't make me take disciplinary action. - Do you really want to do that? - Do you want to? Sarge, I'm sorry. - He knows he's wrong. - Okay, I won't do it. Damn it, what the hell are you playing? - Do you like it? - One more game. Shit! I'm really sorry, so sorry! - Will you do it again? - No, I'll never harm you. - Never again, huh? - Were you scared? You morons! - Who? Who are you swearing at? - My mother? Stop! Enough! - Sarge. - Huh? I didn't call you. I just can't put this out. I'm sorry. - Put it out! Quickly! Put it out! - Hey! - We can't stop it, Sarge. - We don't have enough time! Help me! Hurry up! Fuckers! HEAVEN'S SEVEN 2 On July 7th, 1937, the Japanese army conquered China, occupying Shanghai, Nanking, and the island of Hainan. The Japanese leaders thought that Asia shouldn't be colonized by the West. However, it can be and should be colonized by other nations in Asia. Western powers were obstacles to the Japanese expansion. China was potentially an obstacle too. Concurrently, many Japanese nationals doing business and living all over Thailand evoked much skepticism in the Thai government about their real motives. BANGKOK, 1940 - Where are you going? - Taking photos. - Is the store open? - Closed. Suriya Ebata is of Japanese descent, currently living in Thailand and working as a photographer. Suriya's father is the notorious Colonel Takeda who's now fighting in a military campaign in China. Suriya's activities are suspicious, and seems to be collecting information on Thailand... BANGKOK TRADE ...and sending it to Japan. We must find out what Suriya Ebata is exactly up to, and whether he's a threat to our national security. - Rama 6 Road. - Yes, sir. Get out of my way. - Hurry up, Akkee. - Tungkuay, wait. - Follow him! - Hey, Akkee! Why do I have to pull this cart? Damn it. Hey, this is pork. Pork? Fuck you! This is pork. Sarge, that's my tattoo. - Why are you doing that? - You're breaking everything. Pull over. I'll get off here. Hey, why are you sleeping here? What are you looking at? Go after him. Captain! Shit! What happened? You look like shit. Were you mauled by a dog? What about Suriya? He got away. Damn it! Akkee, go fetch Juk and Sarge Dub. I'll get Moh. He's watching the back door. Go! Hey! - Is it a complete map of Thailand? - I think so. - What's up? Why aren't you on duty? - Take a look at this. It's my turn. You ruined it. What's taking you so long? I need to poop now. What's wrong, Captain? That stinks. - Who's that? - Is it Suriya? Why did you hide? He's such a pain in the ass. Are you Suriya? That's Suriya, for sure. He cut me. My clothes are ruined. Shit! He doesn't respect my tattoo. Sarge, that's amazing. - Yeah, Sarge. - Brilliant move. He's smarter than Sarge. He wore protective armor. That's cheating. - You're dead. - Captain, don't. Let me go. Are you crazy? He cut me even with my mystical tattoos. Hit him harder. Get him. That's the one. He's a lunatic. He watched me when I was showering. My dear Suriya, did you get hurt? Help me. Please help me! - Come on, guys. - Sarge! Wait for us. THAILAND CONCERNED ABOUT DISPLEASING JAPAN AND ARRESTS A SCAPEGOAT WANTED ONE YEAR LATER WANTED Be more careful next time. Do not attack until the order is given. I will begin negotiations with the Thais. If at all possible, there will be no loss of life. Yes, sir. Forward! Police, sir! Police! There was a shooting in the market. The police are chasing the suspects. Damn it. Who's there? Who is it? Who are you? We're the Imperial Japanese Army. Hey! Fire! Fire! December 8th, 1941, from two hours onwards, the Imperial Japanese Army began entering Thailand by sea, landing at Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chumphon, Surat Thani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Songkhla, Pattani and Bang Pu in Samut Prakan, as well as by land at Pratabong and Phiboon Songkram. The Thai Military, the Police and the Cadets engage in an intense fight. The Japanese Ambassador explains to the Prime Minister that Japan declared war on England and the United States. But Thailand isn't an enemy. Japan needs to cross Thai borders. Stop shooting! Both sides, please stop shooting. The Thai government allowed Japan to enter Thailand. Please stop shooting. Put the guns down. Run! The Japanese are attacking. Hurry up. Run! Isn't that Suriya, the owner of the photo studio? Yes. - Suriya! - Suriya! Your father and I were good friends. I want to settle the score for his murder. However, the Thai government... wishes to handle this case themselves. You must stay calm, and try not to be too hasty. Or there could be reprisals. We're here for the prisoners. Hey. Did I say that right? Thank you. Release him. Go! Excuse me. Come back. They were in on it together. - What did he say? - How the hell would I know? Ask their guns. What's going on, sir? They're taking our prisoners. Fucking assholes! Disguising as Thai soldiers. We two are dispatched by the Royal Thai Government. I remember you. You're dead! - Let's get out of here. - Quick. Damn it! I'm not dying now. I'm protected by tattoos! You're gonna die! Assholes! - Come on! - Wait for me. BAN KHRUA BRIDGE My God! Who kicked me? It's Sarge. Let's get out of here. Hurry up! The Japanese! This way! Hey, take it, Juk. What the hell are you doing? They're following us! Take that! And this! Here comes another one! And this. Take that! This and this! For you! - He's damn tough. - Extremely tough. You sure have grit. I'm not fighting you. Ugly son of a bitch. Come on. Come here. I'll tell you something. Come on. You're a tough one, aren't you? You won't die easily. Give me a go. Make it tight. - Stay still. - Stop wriggling. Are you ready? Don't hurt me. Please let me go. What's he saying? He's having a go at you. No, he's not. He said he's ready. Got it. Your Japanese is amazing. If you're ready then... Goodbye! If you don't want to have problems with the Japanese army, you must apprehend the fugitives and bring them to us. We will apprehend them, and they will be punished according to our laws. Bring them to us. You're dead. In the next round, the Seven Samurais must fend off the Heaven's Seven. - Stop. - Hold onto the pier. Go! - Are you Thai? - Of course I am. No way. Your friends are sons of bitches. I won't let them stay. Please, Papa. If you won't help them, the Japanese will kill them. Please. You don't have a clue, Tungkuay. This is an anti-Japanese society. If the Japanese follow them here, and you guys aren't here, we'll be ruined. No, we won't. My friends are good. Please help them. Who's that? Stop making the geese honk! Come in, idiots! Thank you for letting us stay, sir. I don't want to let you stay, but those geese are a nuisance, dumbass. Damn! Who's that? I have some bad news for you. The Japanese found out that people are gathering here to fight against them. - You must be extra vigilant. - What? - Not to get in trouble. - Really? Is that you, Sergeant Dub? It really is you, Sarge! - What did you do to him? - Nothing bad. These people are national heroes. - Heroes. - Heroes. - They killed many Japanese. - Killed Japanese? I'm so glad to meet you. If you need anything, tell me. Now Japanese soldiers are hunting us. But we have nowhere to hide. Let's hide here. If you want to stay here, you must work. Akkee and Sarge will guard the main entrance. Tungkuay and Dan will help cutting paper. The other three, deliver the newspapers to these locations on the map. One noodle soup, please. - Tungkuay's dad has an easy life. - How easy? - He listens to the radio all day long. - You know nothing. He listens to news from abroad so he can print them. You and your brother think you know everything, don't you? Anything you don't know? We just happen to be clever. Clever? You call that clever? - Just look at Mhad. - What do you mean? - So clever, not to be in this episode. - Hey, keep quiet for a bit. Why? That's much better. Your farts smell like a dead rat. How about this? Wait here while I do my business. Just make it quick. Shit! What's that? What on earth did I eat this morning? It stinks like hell. Die! Are you familiar with the bridge over the river Kwai project? Yes, sir. I think you should be posted there. I'm sorry, sir. I must kill the Heaven's Seven for my father's death. Don't bring your personal problems before those of the nation! You will be posted there. We've uncovered their hideout, sir. This writing states a meeting will be held tonight, and these are feces from one of the seven fighters. Would you like to have dinner first? I'm sorry, I can't. I must hurry home. That's too bad. I can't take you home today because I'm on duty. It's okay. I'm leaving, darling. Sir, to Bangkok Noi railway station. Those are some bright shorts. You used to like them, didn't you? Dub! Dub, I missed you. I missed you so much. Are you still mad at me? Are you angry that I didn't reply to your letters? How come you're a boatman? Why won't you talk to me? Don't you want to talk to me? I know that you still love me and think of me. Don't you? Why do you behave like that? Like what? Like a whore, sleeping with Japanese soldiers. Shit. Hey, what's fucking wrong with him? He's heartbroken. How come? It's his ex-wife Chom. She's sleeping with a Japanese soldier. He saw them at the market. Poor man. Please help me. Help me. Please. Hey, Dan. You've got a job to do. Leave the girl alone. Sarge, you're too old. You don't understand how exciting and intense puppy love is. Dan, so how exciting can this puppy love be? Don't you know? Here, I'll show you. Sew Sew, I beg you. Please don't tell my friends. No worries. Hey, Dan, there's a missile going up your truck. Are you Thai? Yes, of course. They don't sound Thai. Let's have a look. - You are Thai. - Definitely Thai. Welcome. Please come inside. They certainly look Thai. Everybody, we all know what the Japanese did to our parents, brothers and sisters in China. How cruel and vicious they were. Hey, Akkee, go get the others. Are you Thai? I'm Chinese. If you're really Chinese, sing a Chinese song. Wang Ping! On the full moon of the 12th month Water ebbed up to the bank Hey, Captain! - Where have you been? - We thought you had been arrested. I demand that you surrender to the government. Hands up! - Hey, it's a joke. - You deserve this. Come on, Captain. What's the problem, sir? Search. But, sir... Show me your opera. Now! Holy shit! It's our enemy. They must be killed! It's our enemy. They must be killed. It's our enemy. They must be killed. Holy shit! We are their enemy. We are hunted down. We are their enemy. We are hunted down. Holy shit! They are the enemy. They are hunted down. We've found one. Sir, he's very lazy. So, I had him caged. Where's the rest of them? Remove the makeup, all of you. All the actors in the troupe are gay. You wouldn't want to look at them. Papa! It hurts! Hello there, sweetie. What the fuck? Asshole, did you think I couldn't see you? Take this. Disappearing trick? Take this one. - Still think you can get away? - See you later, Tungkuay. Die! Asshole! What the hell is wrong with you? Time to die. Who's that? Want to get away? Try this one. Hello. How about this fist? Who did that? I can see you. Time to die. You'll die! Enough, I give up. So, there you are. Enough! I give up! I can see you. Where are you going? Die, damn you! Kill them. Go to hell! Papa! Are you all right? - Papa. - Let's help. Hurry up. Papa! How did this happen? Papa! How did it fall here? Papa! Sarge, villagers told me the Japanese captured Tungkuay's dad. Papa! Papa. Chom hangs out with the Japanese. I'll find out if she knows anything. Hello, ma'am. Is that you, Sarge Dub? Please help me. I don't know what to do. Bombs are constantly being dropped around here. Where is Chom? The Japanese took her away a few days ago. Why would they take her? I saw she willingly went with them. She never wanted to. Our house and business were repossessed. She tried to help by doing business with the Japanese, that's all. She's in tears every day. So beautiful. Iced tea, please. Of course. A mouse, get out of here! Chom. Tell me, where are you keeping the Chinese man and the Thai girl? - You don't know? - Don't know? Don't know? Tell me! He's not talking. What should we do? Tungkuay, I heard that the Japanese love eating human flesh. I bet your father has already been made into soup. That hurts! Sarge, you shouldn't have incited him. What are we going to do? Hey, Tungkuay. If he dies, you'll never find out where your dad is detained. So, tell us before he bites you to death. I don't understand what you're saying. Please, let me go. - What did he say, Sarge? - I don't know. I only heard "Runda". Runda! Hey, Tungkuay! I'm out of here. Damn it, he can speak Thai. Tungkuay! How'd it go, Sarge? Did you catch him? Did you catch him? No. But I found out that he's in love with a Thai girl. Bitch, traitor. How could she fall for someone like that? Exactly. But don't worry. I'll handle it myself. No way. No, we'll do it together. Yeah, Juk's right. You have to take us to see that bitch. Hold on. There's no need. There is nothing to see. She's so basic and I don't know how that Jap fell for her. She's boring and to be honest, quite ugly. - Did you say she was ugly? - Exactly. - What are you thinking? - Are you crazy? Well, I just want revenge for Tungkuay. That's all. I want to be that coconut, so she can rub me too. - I'd be happy to be a stool. - Okay. Rub it. Scrape it. Rub it. Would you like soap, my love? - Are you flirting with me? - Get down here. Angsuman, play the zither for me, please. Yes, Mom. Angsuman. This is a map of Tha Tian Market. I found out that Angsuman likes to go there nearly every day. This is the important spot. Here. Right here. We will place our lead actor here. Don't worry, I'm not going to play that role. I've stopped looking for girls. The right person for this mission is... Sergeant Dub. Akkee, if you help me, I'll give you ten satang. What the fuck would I do with ten satang? Okay, I'm already broke. How about 20 satang? Help me out. Just for you, I'll do it. We will wait until she and her boyfriend reach the mark. Then we'll begin as planned. After that, Juk will throw a fake grenade into the crowd. Once the two are separated and it's chaotic, then Dan, Kla, Tungkuay, Moh, your job is to deal with Kobota. Let's go! Then our lead actor will take his turn. The star is here! Amazing, Sarge! And they both live happily ever after. - What's wrong with him now? - Sarge. Who's that? It's nonsense. Ma'am, this way, please. Help me, please. Here they are. They want to kill your man. Help! Please help me! Help! They're trying to kill a Japanese soldier. Help! - Akkee, just you wait! - Help! They're trying to kill a Japanese soldier! I won again. You took my money. Hey, Kobota. What are you doing? - I'm broke. So, I'll bet with my sword. - No way, how come? You can't use it. What if you lose then use it to fight? I would be dead. What about you, Ang? Are you broke? What will you bet with? Bet something. Give it a go. Come on. It's all gone! This is all I have. My zither. To be honest, I was playing for fun. I didn't think it would turn out like this. So, Mr. Kobota, what are you going to gamble with this time? I'm broke. I have nothing left. There is one more thing if you're willing to consider it. Whoever wins the next round... can have Ang as their wife. - Oh, shit. - Come here! - Why are you laughing? - What more do you want? Next time, Ang should get his cunning blood out of his head! Give me a break, Sarge. From now on, I'll take charge. Sarge, don't forget my papa. I'm now making plans for your dad. If I can get to Ang, I'll coax her for intel from Kobota to find out your dad's location. Do you get it now? Idiot. You're more interested in that bitch than in my papa. Don't call her that. I'm not hungry. I'm off. - Wait a minute, Sarge. - What? Let me deal with Ang. You're too old. She doesn't like that. Sit down. No, I don't need your help. You'd probably fall for her. Just stick to your wife from the opera troupe. Focus on your work. - Is it his hubby or wife? - His hubby, Sarge. Sarge, will my papa die before Ang falls for you? Why don't you just rape her? Hey! Sounds good to me. No way! This must be done nicely and softly. Don't tell me you love her and want to keep her to yourself. Are you crazy? It's not like that. Well, in case you think I'm taking advantage, let's play a draw game. Whoever gets the longest stick wins, okay? Brilliant. Hold it. Choose wisely. Seven sticks. Hey, where the hell did everyone go? Where are they? Hey, wait for me! - This way, Sarge. - Hey! Hey, wait for me! Damn cheaters! Sir, to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Yes, ma'am. Just a second, Miss. Just a second. Whether it's close or far, I'm at your service. Three are too many. Would Aunty and Grandma take that one? This way, Miss. That sounds good. Mom and Grandma, you take this one. Then we won't feel cramped. Out of my way, please. Come on, follow us, Mom! Grandma! Come on, quickly! We're wasting time. We meet again. It must be our fate. I'm so shy. Hey, you cheater! Give me back my Ang, and take back your aunty. Sir! Where are you taking me? We're already in Bang Kapi. Calm down. Don't worry. This is fun. Miss, that's the rapist the police are looking for. Stop! Let me get off! Sarge. - What? - Is this how it's gonna be? - Why not? - Fine! Bring it on! - Miss, are you okay? - Let me go. Don't touch me. - Wait for me. Wait. - Mom! You pervert. Be careful. Police! Have you lost your mind, Sarge? Hey, the police. Officer, arrest him. He's a rapist. - Are you all right? - Something hurts inside. I don't think I'm going to make it. We should take him to the house. To treat the wounds. Get up. Let's go, sir. Hey, I'm hurt too! Sorry, does it hurt? No, ma'am. It's just hot. I'm sorry. Right here. Food's ready. Come on, give me a hand. I'll give you a massage. Uncle Dub was amazing. No need to call me Uncle Dub. We're friends. - Is this your new husband? - No, ma'am. No. Take your time. I'm going to check on the soup. It should be close to being ready. I'll massage you a little lower. No, that's okay. I'm quite sensitive. Why do you trust him? He saved my life. I'm serious, Ang. He doesn't seem trustworthy. I've seen him somewhere before, but I don't remember where. Don't worry about it. Let's have dinner. If you don't believe me, I won't eat. I don't want to eat with him. You're showing no respect for me. Excuse me, I must say goodbye. I apologize if I have caused a misunderstanding in your family. Goodbye. Please wait, Uncle. Don't go just yet. I beg you, just call me Dub. Okay. Dub... Dub, don't go. Have dinner with us. I cooked my signature dish today. You too, Kobota. Stop acting like a child. Let's have dinner. - Come on, Uncle. - Dub, please. Yes, Dub. Come on. - Daring Dub, come and join us for dinner. - Holy shit! Exactly. Old people should stay where they belong. You're blasting my ears. What the hell are you complaining about? - I have mystical tattoos. - Calm down, Juk. Today's a good day. Don't fight. Today's an auspicious day for Sarge. Show him respect. Sarge, have you found out where they detained my papa? - Sarge, have you... - Hey! What's up with you, Tungkuay? - Why are you so pushy? - You don't give a damn about me. I want to know where they have my papa. I feel bad for him. - He took wonderful care of you. - What? You only keep talking about that bitch. You're a waste of good food! - Who wants rotten food? - Shut up! Sarge, you're ungrateful. You've just insulted me. You little chink! - Are you having a go at me? - So what? - Tungkuay! - Do you have a problem with that? - Hey, listen. - Announcement from the Thai government. The Japanese and Thai governments wish to congratulate Lieutenant Kobota and Miss Angsuman on their forthcoming engagement. To strengthen the nations' relationship, the two governments will host their engagement ceremony soon. It's an honor to unite the two countries together. All of you are about to die. If you wish to say anything to my pretty Thai fiancée, I can tell her for you whilst we are... And then we are... Your papa is either dead or working his ass off as a slave. Or better yet, is being gang-raped by the other prisoners till death. I can't hold back anymore. Fire! - Asshole! - Why are you keeping him alive? Let's get it done. Come on! Go! Hey, where are you keeping my papa? - I'll tell you! - Well? He's working on the railway construction in Kanchanaburi. That's it. If you'd told us before, you could've avoided all this pain. Hey, take this too. Kobota! Kobota. Please stay with me, Kobota. Take me to the hos... Don't say the word. You might make it worse. - I'm dying. - Please don't die. After the war, we can move to Japan. You'll take me to see the cherry blossoms. During the Matsuri festival, we'll meet again on the Milky Way. Kobota! It won't be long until we meet again on the Milky Way. Hey, where are you going? Shit! Hey, man, come here. Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Great. You speak Thai. Take off your shirt. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Damn. Those are the only words he can say. Shoot at my chest and I'll fall into the water. I have mystical tattoos. - Your tattoos won't help much. - Whatever. Hey, why are you still here? You can go now. Go! Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Bastard! His is much bigger than mine. Don't hit me. Asshole. Serves him right. Kill him! If you try to escape, you will be shot. Let's go before they find out. Come on. Nearly took my ear off, prick. What are you doing here? Put your clothes on. You bastard! You sick pervert! Hey, keep your voice down. The guards could hear us. Do you want to get caught? Chom, what happened? They made us their sex slaves. Bastards! There are so many prisoners here. How can we find Tungkuay's father? Captain! Moh, Kla, I knew you wouldn't leave me here to rot. Is this a disguise for your mission? What disguise? Help me out of here. Hurry up. - Sit down, Captain. - What are you doing? Get me out of here. Hurry up! Quiet. You'll get us all killed. Why are you hitting me? It hurts! Great. Amazing. Perfect. Ruthless. Two Thai assholes in disguise are here. You prick! Intruders! Where are your son and his colleagues? Excuse me, sir. We've captured some intruders. Dan and Juk haven't returned yet. Search everywhere. They must be somewhere. Do it now. Yes, sir. There will be a lot of deaths. Die! I'm here to help you. Papa! Papa! Papa, don't fall asleep. Stay with me. Sarge, please help my papa! Why are you just standing there? Help my papa! Papa, stay with me. Captain, please help my dad! Papa. Listen, Tungkuay. Even though we're of Chinese descent, we live in Thailand. Don't ever betray your home. Each and every one of us... must stand up for Thailand. No one must be allowed to oppress or destroy us. Papa! Tungkuay, let him go. He's in a better place now. Papa! Hey, Sarge. Suriya. Are you insane, Suriya? Even in times of war, there is no reason to murder the prisoners. Once this war is over, I'll personally have you court-martialed. Now it's their turn! No one can defeat the Imperial Japanese Army. - Kill them all. - Yes, sir. Hey, hurry up. Where are you going? Get out. I'll slaughter you, Suriya. Hurry up! Quickly, come on! Quickly. Come on! Hey, get down! You're dead, Suriya. Hey, this way! Hold on. Kla, get up here. Hold on tight. We're two kilos over the limit. We'll crash! You're overweight. Get off, Captain! Who'll fly the plane? I don't know. What a bunch of idiots. Where are you going? My God. Help me! Moh, can you fly a plane? Sure, it's a piece of cake. It's like flying a kite. Once it finds an air stream, it flies itself. No! Hey! I thought you said you could fly. We're done for! Brake! Moh, brake! What are you doing? Brake. Moh! Moh! Where is it? Holy shit! My papa saved us! You're dead now. This one is for my papa. - You're difficult to kill. - Nice ass. - Come here! - What if he shits his pants? Let's go for it. This son of a bitch is so tough, Sarge. You're dead. He's still alive. - Shit! - A bomb! We are here today... to celebrate the love that this young couple has for each other. What do you mean "young"? He's a dinosaur. Tungkuay, have you seen all those wrinkles? Shut up! I forgot what I needed to say. This affectionate couple has long been in love. And I believe that if they could get it on together, it would be perfect. Shut up! You're making me feel so hot. What are you saying? Damn! That hurts, bitch. Stop it, Juk. You're wrong. You can't talk to her mom like that. But, Dub, we're about to get married. There's no need to call me Mom. You should call me Little Yaowamarn. Yaowamarn. I wouldn't call you "Little." Shut up! We are here to ask for Ang's hand, not yours. - Dub, how can you do this to me? - Wait... You made love to me and then you just throw me away? Wait. When did I make love to you? Dub, you bastard! You had my mom and now you want me? It's not like that, Ang. - Sarge! - Dub! Be careful! Bad fish might upset your stomach. Will you all just shut up? Dub, darling. - It's just a misunderstanding, my love. - You can't just leave me. Listen, Sarge loves Ang. Not you. That's not true. Not true! Hey, you old bitch. That hurts. Slaphead, did you just punch my mom? No, don't, Ang! You can marry Sarge. Take him. I've changed my mind. I prefer this one. He's got a nice, strong punch. No way! One more time, sweetie. Hit me again. Feels good. Good. I want one too. - This guy is handsome. - I want none of this! That's cool. So I can have Ang? Wait! Over my dead body, Dan. You don't have to worry. You see? She doesn't like you. She likes me. You'll all be dead soon. Wait for me! Hey, I'm out of here. Hey, where are you going, Grandma? Hey, Grandma! Move it. Beat her! Heaven's Seven, meet your death! GOODBYE
