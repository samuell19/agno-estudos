- Yes. - was so fast here none yet. This will be a super meantime. Oh, that was close, but he has made it. Now a beautiful curve. Then he pulls the machine again on its axis. Ladies and gentlemen... something I have indeed not yet seen. - Yes! - Felix. And if he does not make any more mistakes now, then the ... a new world record. But what you doing now ... - please happen? - Felix. - Yikes. - We overslept. Today is... - First day of school in Otto. - Exactly. Come on, hurry. - T-shirt I bring you yet. Come on. - Okay. Here, Mom sent you to the start of school. - Cool. - Pretty cool. So here. Arm through. Jacket. Breakfast. Is important. Here we go. You have to fully concentrate on teaching. OK? Careful, Dad. Whoops. - Hold on to the rules, right? - Yes. Traffic light. Say, who as an answering machine at school? Felix. You're just kicked out of school ... because you gambled during the math test. If you want to become a pilot really do the thing out and start by. - Felix, that's ... - My last chance here. Otherwise we have to move. I read the pilot test is fully hard. Maybe I will but what else. What? You want to for years ... I strain to me, okay? Come over. Hello? Here. - Oha. - Oh. I thought the founder of this school ... would have been a true friend of children. Well, come on. Yes. Yes. - What are you doing? - Oh ... Good day. Vorndran my name. This is my son, Felix. Going from today to school here and we wanted to ... report to the Director. Unfortunately we are ... - a bit late. - You are wrong here. The old staff room is not in use for years. Oh, really? Why not? You must then along and then left. Yes. Well then... Many Thanks. but oh, this is a strange bird. Yes, we are now a little too late. Excuse me. It's just that we have a very old alarm clock and ... Let guide you. This is our school motto. You have probably read at the front gate. In Latin. We teach here for over 100 years ... according to the latest educational methods. Felix VORNDRAN ... are you prepared to give you this? Yes, so I wanted to go to school here. If I'm honest, I have my doubts ... if you're right here. They also? But we have principles. And thanks to our school's founder, Otto Leonard ... here it is the custom that every ... regardless of its origin and previous school performance ... Opportunity given to prove themselves, so even you. Hot. In three months, will decide on your shot. Next week two exams are written. Which must be passed. we understand each other? Ask? Yes. It works here, so quiet and empty. - Do you have school trip today? - Here there is discipline. No romping, running, screaming, climbing, whistling, hopping. So just breathe and learn? Soft breathing and learning. - Bring him into the 5b. - Thank you. Many Thanks. but is not so bad, right? - Ouch. - Excuse me. Dr. Schmitt Gössenwein, I wish I could say ... how nice to see you. Mr. School Henning, I told you already ... told on the phone that I'm not going to talk about today. You can not change the future, Mrs. Schmitt Gössenwein. Rules are rules in this house. They are, once introduced, for you all as well as for me. Now is a student clinic, then I have class. Morning at 10 o'clock I'm here again. And then you have time. You still get writing ... as service instructions, I promise you. A Instructions I will of course be followed. this store'm here at the Nut! You've really no reason to laugh. In you. If you somehow have trouble with her ... - then they imagine naked. - What? I always do with customers, if I trouble with those. - Easy naked. - Dad, that's fully sick. Or in clown costume. Or small. Very small Small. This also works. - I'll go in, take off. - Everything roger, captain. Have fun and behave yourself, will you? Get lost, Mario. Hi. I am Felix. Hi, Felix. Wow. A Parrot Drone. With camera. At home I have a pair of glasses so. Because you think you're sitting in it. Krass. Do you think I could ever lighten up? - Depends. - What? - Whether you are one of us. - Nervt type, boss? Who is that? I think his name is Felix. Bit resinous, the guy. Looks like a loser. - Are you coming to our class? - Yes. My name is Felix Vorndran. This is my first day here. Vorndran? Is that a nickname? Look, Vorndran. You face only once in the back. That was good. Hintendran. The gag is really new. Your probably are the Checker here, huh? Exactly. Better you know it you. Attention! Schmitti comes. Good Morning. Good morning, Dr. Schmitt Gössenwein. But. What are you standing around there? The seat next to Ella is free. This is more of a Feline than Felix. Front nix it. Felix, on the board, please. Remember, you're only student on trial here. Books out. Write to: edge length A, 40 centimeters. Can you please orient yourself on the box? This is not a decoration. - But I've yet. - Again please. We have a sponge. Please draw a square pyramid ... with isosceles triangles. - That's when all the pages of the same length ... - Felix. - Is that wrong? - Triangle ruler. After that you make of twain one octahedron ... and call me H, the height. Yes, and before that? What have they taught you at that other school? Do you have any idea what you have to do? Math is not really my thing. Not yours. What does this mean? I'm not good at math. We have already noted. Ella, the space next to you will be not used for long. Can you enlighten us? Which is always the case. It will come. If you knew what was dranhängt for me. Man has dissed the closest. Schmittis enemies are almost back our friends. Really? What are you doing here for so during the break? Kick? Or skate? - Who exactly do you mean? - Well you. Look, Rear whistles. You have to decide to whom you belong up here. To us, to the girl or to the remaining losers. If you want to belong to us ... you need three tests of courage exist. Really? Clear. We had to get all. I've made four voluntary. - Yeah. - And? Are you in? What are these tests of courage? Did you know that it is haunted at school? Buhu. Evil. And I'm supposed to catch a ghost? No. Only a break. The old staff room. In the dark. Was? A slump? Phew. Have probably scared of Schmitti what? Are probably still a loser. Felinchen. Have probably scared of Schmitti what? Are probably still a loser. Felix, this is your last chance here ... otherwise we have to move. Felinchen. Jeez, Michalski, what is it? - you still work? - I correct. One of the few pleasures in life of a teacher. You should not be so late here anymore. Your concern honors me, but I'll be fine. Good night, Mr. Michalski. As you wish. Good night. - Get lost, Hulda. - Who is talking of there? Well, with the spirit ... - spits here. - Hulda Stechbarth? The director was once here. The now spits in the old staff room, from the ... I should get out waving. Who believes such a Dünnpfiff? He should really there to break? What is to happen already? We're so dope here. Wow. I am in. Come, if you dare. Full crass here. Oh ... Oh, it's you. Felix VORNDRAN. Can you please tell me what you middle of the night ... you doing in the forbidden part of this school? Since I am probably run anyway. And my watch that ... So ... The battery of my phone, the ... Do not lie to me. You hide but there's something. Burglary, lying, stealing ... That's it then probably for you. You broke so many rules on the first day ... like no other students in his trial. I'll call your parents now. No. Please do not. Not naked. What do you mumbling? Speaks clearly. What did he say? I should just me ... If you do not immediately an extraordinary explanation ... have for your presence to offer ... - is certain my decision. - I'll put it to me ... - Then I have no choice ... - ... very tiny front. Mrs. Schmitt Gössenwein? Where are you going? What's going on? - Felix? - Mario? I'm here. Killer Bude here, huh? The first test of courage you have passed, kid. I do not know if I will come to the second test of courage. That was scary fully straight. - Was Hulda Stechbarth here? - I'll make the finish. No. Schmitti. Schmitti. - That was not a joke? - Let us rather go ... Ouch, what's that? Igittigitt that are at least 20 kilos of chewing gum. Which then goes here ... Fits. Looks good. Where do you come so late come from? I have to tell you something. Because of school. Oh, Felix. You promised that you give yourself trouble. Yes, and I also. But there are a couple of guys and ... Come here. Come here. - Tell. What's happening? - It was a dare. I thought, if I'm not mitmache, I'm the loser. I was waving from the old staff room again. - You should then break? - Yes. That's not so easy in a new class. I also had a bad feeling, but ... ... at school, I thought. I want to explain ... but then they caught me. I think. It was really funny. Felix, that was your first day on the Otto. Yes I know. Adelheid, concentrating you. What should I do? Above all, I was the task. - Think about it. You have to set priorities. I had just the old school. Which was full nasty. - box sponge ... - toilet. Triangle ruler. Since I've even thought of your tip. Well not naked, of course. I just wanted to have no fear of this ... - old ... - Old Goat? Mario and his friends ... Mist. Mother. This could go. Ok. Come come come. Ok. From the little problem we tell mom anything, will you? Remember, we have jointly decided as a family ... Mama expanding its design in America. And so we have to manage here, ok both now? Ok? I'll call tomorrow at school. - Ready? - Yes. Well, my boys? - Hi mum. - Well, my Cunning? Today I dreamed night of you. How are you? Well, except for Klitzekleinigkeiten. All right, Felix? Yes, yes, everything crass well. Especially in the new school. Yes. Only teething problems. Well, that's ... That's normal. - Yes, that's normal. - You were a stupid phase. - This will again. - It's just ... You always told me math so well. And on the Otto ... - they do not take me anyway. - What? Why not? - That's not certain. - What? - Not quite. - But in Scharntrop ... but there's no other school more. - Then I'll come back immediately. - No, no, no ... - absolutely no way. - If it does not work on the Otto ... then we have to move. I'm talking about equal with colleagues. No, Mama, please, I get the back down. Honey, that's your breakthrough. You have to finish your design. We can get it already controlled. Yes Peter, but you have yet ... - work too. - That works. That works. Look here. And? Well, maybe a bit daring. Yes, it takes the form of the tree standing here in front. Where have I now my bonsai? I'm still ... - Ugh, what is that? - 1.25 liters of sage. Mom, I'm sorry. I get the back down. You would me but already say if I should come? Yes, but I can handle it alone. I give full thrust. Have become pretty big, you know? You have yet to build your house. - Sleep well, my sweetheart. - Non-Sweet said. - Night Mom. - Good night. - Whew. - That was close. And. Ouch. What's this? High time to get up. Na jump, jump, jump. What's this? A nightmare? - Yes, you could say that. - I beg your pardon? It's a nightmare. Not a dream ... What have I done? I beg your pardon? That was me. I saw you yesterday small desired. Stop yelling at me. I'm not hard of hearing. It may be small wish anyone. This contradicts the laws of physics. Furthermore, why should you? Well, I did not want naked me ... I saw you ... just zoomed small. With two fingers. In my head. Zapp. Get dressed. I urgently need a breakfast. - Ouch. - What are you... for a rough guy. Do not you have no sensitivity? Is that the kitchen here? That's disgusting. I take sage tea ... and crispbread with cottage cheese and sprouts. Have we not guaranteed. When have you cleaned the last time here? Igittigitt. Quark I only take if it is not already open. Do not worry, something we do not eat here. All right. We have to hurry back to school. That's the only possibility. I lose so every ounce of authority ... when you see me like this. Do you think this school spirit has to do with it? Hulda Stechbarth? No. What are you doing with your fingers? Well, I'm trying ... - to wish you great. - Aha. I thought, then you may thank me ... and forget about last night. Believe me, I've never been forgetful. Not a word. - Did you say something? - Nope ... I thought in thought. - Have you fallen out of bed? - You could say that. Yes. Nice. Can we have breakfast together. No, I'm making just a Quark bread. For school. - A quark bread? - Uh-huh. Since when do you make yourself as bread? By cutting? Thanks, that's fine. This is such a thing on the Otto. - because They principles. - This old shrapnel. Shall I drive you? No no. I'll take the skateboard. Thank you. Bye, Dad. Let me out of here now, I'm drowning in Quark yes. My costume. I have an important appointment. I will throw you out of school as soon as I can. This is really the low point of my teaching career. That would you like that? Take time to bring your teacher around the corner. As you could thus solve your problems. Now watch out my stuff on ... you do burn, yes. So they run a but. Quiet. I will take you to the old staff room now. When we get there, not great ... You can sleep in the trash. I for one am then finished with you. It then goes along here on. Come in. Come in. With your financial help ... we will create something unique here. Exclusively for children like you. This room has not been used for years. This Otto Leonhard probably had a little screw loose. He has set up a kind of Africa Museum here. We throw all rubbish in the trash and build here ... a big club for the parents of the students. If you quite a lot, finally free ... to enroll their children here. What's going on there? Michalski, you do something. You idiot! Yes, that ... That I'm really terribly sorry. - There's already who. - What? Who then? Well, the guy you did not want to see. The straight wipes bath foam ... - from the others. - The Board of Education? Has nothing to do here. Tell him that I give him banned. Why should I invest myself with the school board? it is not enough if you throw me out? If you do not soon say what ... - there is no school. - What? I give him banned. Come on. What are you standing there so rum? Do not you have class? But. Me to tell you something. From Schmitti ... Schmitt Gössenwein. but oh, I'm curious. It grants you banned. Schmitt Gössenwein given us banned? My ass. As this old dragon sends you before ... Is not ... - a total failure? - Ahem. My son ... Maybe you know yes to Mario ... Should have about your age ... Who told things ... You can align your teacher ... that the deregistration of Mario ... has already worked in the school office. Your school now has too few students. Tomorrow at the school conference it all out. The school is closed. - OK. I tell her. - Very nice. Then we go along here on. Thank you, my boy. Please come. Thus, since the front left-hand side you will find the cafeteria ... Can experience something. Come on, go in there. Moment wrong. What do you mean, the school is closed? This is not yet official. I need this school ... - in Scharntrop. - Do you think... I let myself from this washcloth ... take away my school? His elite school, he can open elsewhere. - An elite school? - Yes. Where children can be as simple as you ... but who, unlike you money. But you have only one student too little. That's again just ... - a scheming trick. - You must take me. You have to write your math same. I see black. You want to flunk me ... although you need me? Rules are rules. They seem. Once introduced ... How do you deal with your stuff? Thus, the filler is broken. What are you doing here? So tell yet ... - Ouch. - help me at work. - How dare you? You brats. - I let myself from you ... but not take away my last chance. This is a 6. And indeed smooth. You get a detention that has washed himself. You are now my cheat sheet. Definitely not. But, otherwise you will remain small. I will help until you help me. Hi. That? Have you already decided? Girl or Vollpfosten? Is not there something else? Well, quite normal here is not one. But the school's ok. - No shit? - Yes. A bit oblique. But most are like here. Despite Schmitti. Why'd you have to actually change schools? This is a bit private. Sorry. Too curious. I know. Everyone says that. No, not bad. I'm just... - not very proud of it. - Mario, you nervst. I will take care of me again ... - if my pencil case. - Clear. - What is it? - This is... Privat. And, sorry. ...absolutely no way. You let me once again get out of here now. So love children, I'm naturally sorry that you all of a sudden ... have to write in my work. But I think I've got some really ... put together really nice things for you to ... and I wish you so much happiness ... and much joy. So what is that? Why has not taken my class work? - What should I write? - And I'm not helping you. The work is so easy that even a birdbrain like you ... thus should have no problems. If you do not help me, I do not help you too. Now caught in heaven's name at last. And. Is this the right way? Apart from this incredible mess ... Surprisingly, yes. I would not have thought. He! Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Mutprobe two. You write with our work. - Are you crazy? - Mobile. How dare this? - You have to help me. - If at all out of the question. How else can I create four works alone? You should not do anything for those types at all. The... Where ... That was just ... the wayward son from the school board, right? I have to write at least a two ... so that even still talking to me. - So help me now? - Why, surely. Gladly. I'll help you. - 4,256,789. - Really? 8.660.100. - Oh no, my pen. - Why...? But thanks, that was really a help. And what do you think as your plan goes now? If you shoot me, we can make you big. Then you have enough students and I to school. And how is that please go? Also... look at how I look. It's just a little ink. We now go only once for Boutique Elegance ... and you buy me a new dress. I buy but not women's clothes. That's mega-embarrassing. And as much coal I have not either. I finally saving up for a ... I have an idea. Here that would have the right size. - But the ugliest dress. - Felix. - What a coincidence. - Oh. Hi, Ella. - Do you fancy dolls? - What doll? Oh those? That's not for me. - Who then? - A girlfriend? - You have a girlfriend? - So ... A friend. And has a problem. - A problem? - Yes ... No ... birthday. You give a friend a doll for your birthday? How sweet. I'm paying now. - Did you just stole what? - What? No. - What are you doing today? - I still have time to school. Then we have the same path. I have right here ... Me too. Mrs. Schmitt Gössenwein! Schmitti, is everything okay? No, Schmitti, you're not ...? Schmitti! Schmitti? Who should it be? I'm glad you complain again. Is that crass! Ella Borsig what is this language? Mrs. Schmitt Gössenwein ... - has shrunk? - Yes. And now it knows soon the whole school. Is that verspurt. You have to tell me everything immediately. How did this happen? - I have no choice, right? - No. And what are you up to now? Where is actually Dr. Schmitt Gössenwein? You can not but in the absence - the school board ... - Why this works? - Please, please, please go. - Morning... on the School Committee, as you will learn everything. because no one can open this damn door? I think that want the whole school ... Come quickly. Well. We have reconstructed everything. You have great wish me now. It does not violate the laws of physics? Yes. No... The circumstances of an experiment ... - must be exactly the same. - As they want. Give your best. - Do everything exactly as it was then. - OK. Not naked. Not naked. You have to do something wrong. Maybe I am not at fault. Should I have been now? That's not to believe. What did you actually said to Felix? I? but that does nothing to the point. but we do not know what something is beside the point. So it can not hurt even if you remember. There was also such a noise ... Well ... Finally, Felix's broken here. - And? - I wanted him ... throw from the school. Even if that means that the school is closed. I stand by. Rules are rules. Because ... That noise. - Fire! - What? It must have something to do with this ball. Because maybe I could help. The comes from the collection ... Otto Leonard. His records I have ... taken with me. What? I did it not stolen, but only borrowed. I love old books. With the salary that will pay me for the school board ... We will increase our first a housekeeper, darling. I have certainly waited long enough. You get more pocket money and sensible friends. Speaking of which ... Who is this new in your class? - Excuse me. - Do not you like you? A new? Why tell me that no one? Has only been there yesterday. With a new student I can not close the school. I hope you bring the ... - again in order. - Naturally. I need a plan. I need to talk to Schmitt Gössenwein. An offer. I make her an offer. The key is under the pot of geraniums. So I would have really not thought of. You probably consider me very narrow-minded, right? Since shoe covers are. And please not touch anything. Do you live here all alone? Yes, because who should still live here then? A gentleman Gössenwein or so. The house is very big. I grew up here with my grandfather. He has left me the house. - Is that you? - When was that? Since I've won a prize as physics student. I could do research in America. Why did not you? My mother works for half a year there. Yes, I was probably just not as brave as your mother. Sounds like you would regret it. Do you dream still? Not that often anymore. But... When I again from the beginning ... I loved it for days just me and my books. The things are over there in the closet. Beware, this is all very ... dusty. This man is really ventured much. I never knew whether the records of a genius ... or a lunatic are. We have at least until tomorrow never everything through. The ball can be opened. Since ash is in it or something. What's this? My name is Otto. Otto Leonhard. My time is over and my life's work is in danger. My successor, Hulda Stechbarth ... is hated by all students. And rightly so ... for they fought every one of my ideas ... for a better education. But I have taken precautions. I will prepare a magical drink here and now. With this magical drink, I let my life ... transmitted in this schoolhouse ... and every fight that dares ... to improve my ideas ... to water down uh. The recipe I owe to the way my old friend ... Chief Chentuki. No, here. Is this some kind of record? As shown in a time capsule? So. We take a hyena ... Hello? - Can you hear me? - A hyena mane. we just boil a hyena mane streak. A pinch Ha-shipment? Huh? Oh... Rabbit droppings. I'm ... A pinch ... Oh ... There are also two oxen ... Two bullfrogs ... Two bullfrog eyes. The whole is now slightly flamed. What? What is written there? A louse? Oh, a mouse. With this magical trunk ... I'm going to transfer my soul into this schoolhouse ... and henceforth fight any ... Oh, I said already. It really black magic. Hammer. Haunted not Hulda Stechbarth at school around ... but this Otto Leonhard. but you do not believe well ... that this lousy professor had the power ... Just like today. The school is to be closed ... and the infamous director disappears. What have I in common with this please Hulda Stechbarth? But I hate no one. Well, I've been hated at the beginning a little bit. What do you mean, "at the beginning"? Well, until I had in class ... or maybe ... A little more precision, please. Until you had shrunk. Until I get better acquainted. So, to be honest ... Until just now. Ella. Say what. He's right. Most are afraid of you. And that leads to ... I have been working for 20 years every day ... twelve hours for the Otto-Leonard High School. Now will come of it, I'm hated ... am and debt at the end of this school? Well, it's not exactly fun in your classroom. Fun? Yes you think me makes it fun? But we now know actually what we need to do. When you take me to the school conference ... you have enough students ... and that Otto can have nothing against you. At least not more than before. But that will not do, not complying with the rules. Your exams ... I am so exhausted. I think you should only once sleep on it. Tomorrow morning you know what is right. We pick you up in front of the school. You can sleep with me if you want. In this dirty junk room? - yes there is only a suggestion. - If you insist ... Thank you. I pick you up tomorrow at 6 am from, right? - Yes. Until tomorrow. - Until tomorrow. Mrs. Schmitt Gössenwein. Now get on before, I come in peace. I have good news for you. Look in your mailbox. Ouch. What's this? - It's time to endure. - I have to show you something. That's crazy. I think I've understood ... had what ideas Otto Leonhard for his school. I have the plan of him ... compared with an aerial view of our school. If one calculates the scale right ... you can see that under the school a kind of course ... must be from many different areas. Here. See here. This room here ... has an edge length of nine centimeters ... 1:50 giving 4.50 meters. - Very good expected. - Watch out... it gets even better. These rooms are interconnected ... and have themes such as "geography" or "science". Felix, the truth is at our school ... is just a dusty cellar. No, I think this Otto Leonhard has there something like ... built playgrounds -. - If you think school ... have anything to do with games, then you're on the wrong track. Also... I was never in a student home ... but if I understand correctly here ... then you want to be a pilot, right? I do not know. You can fly to America whenever you want. And if this is your dream ... then you must not lose sight of him. You have to fight for it, then you can do it too. I am quite willing to help you. Really? Yes. Of course I have it only once again become great. Otto Leonhard, can you hear me? She takes me, she wants to save the school. I guess we'll have until this afternoon ... nor stop the school board. Is that an H? - Yes, what else? - This may see no one. You must make the bow higher. I know myself as a go high. - I could sign. - Felix ... this must be a valid document. But that H can really nobody ... Do not be so pedantic. You make me crazy. You just need to say. You can not quite make it's yet. She is right. Do not give up. You know how it's done. So, my dear friends and plums ... so I've corrected your class work and I have to ... regrettably say that looks for many not look good. Ella, you are the worthy exception. A two. Felix must first arrive with us, the first task ... was quite good, then you have fallen sharply. Four minus. For Mario, Robert ... and Chris unfortunately a five. - What? - The Mark a three-minus. - What have you done? - Sven ... Well, four. - You're dead, Feline. - ... a good four. You're too slow. I'm sorry. It is urgent, you Hool. - Leave him in peace. - That's one thing with guys. Let go of me, you Vollpfosten. How dare you to ride us so in the shit? That was not planned. My partner has let me down. Oh yes? Who was that in your pencil case on your phone? - I can not say that. - what do I owe the five? - Come on, say it. - No. Felix, explain it to them. Hold him fast. A doll? This is a kind of good luck charm. - It looks like Schmitti. - Vorndran ... you're really perverse. With you, we want to have nothing to do. Give immediately Schmitti ago! - Uh ... My Schmitti doll. - Forget it, Feline. You get back only when you can think of you something ... as you geradebiegst your total failure again. Damn it. There are not even two hours for upperclassmen. We need Schmitti immediately. But no food envy. Did you cold? Lick me... Was...? What's this? I'm just saying reluctantly, but ... I fear some kind of curse. Mrs. Schmitt Gössenwein? Unfortunately, yes. Could you please remove this cat? My allergy ... I can not stand for that. What have you got in there? - Was that you in Felix's pencil case? - Yes. And I have to tell you ... you are very well served by the Five. You have to work so do not write. This is actually a six. What are you looking at me? What do you want from me? Have you ever seen a toilet bowl from the inside? Or been grilled? Mario Henning, what are you thinking? You can not do that. You're not going ... I'm warning you. You can not imagine what I will in a dream ... it all have done. I will tell everything down to your father. I think he would be happy ... like most students. - No car there. - That does not mean... - that he is alone. - We still have to try it. No, you do not do that. This is for your constant nagging. This is for your arrogance. No. Please, I apologize, yes. Declined. This is for your dreary lessons. I'm not finished with you. My snake is not yet full. - Ella. What do you want? - The doll. Man, Ella. Do you take me for such a spaz? Why are you helping this sacrifice Felix? Well, because your father else closes down our school? If you were just a bit nicer, I could ... ensure that you can stay in school. Really? Because you could do what? Yes. You're the only girl in the class ... which I find quite ok. And ... Do I have to enter your gang? Nope. The transition will be dissolved. Why then? Robert's parents are eternally broke ... and Chris are so verpeilte revolutionary ... - Not just the elite. - Sounds almost as if the ... could still be what between us. But be honest ... Do you Schmitti? - Yeah. - all I wanted to hear. - What? - You have... an abduction added. Hey, give the forth immediately. What do you want...? Open up this door. - Schmitti? - Let me in! Come on. Open up. Let me in. - Schmitti? - Felix. I'm so glad you're here. Schmitti, there you are. Felix! Open up! The only question is, how do we get out of here now? I'll kill you! - I have an idea. - What? Absolutely no way. Schmitti, trust me. You're doing now! Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, may I warmly on our ... Welcome extraordinary upperclassmen hot. As you see in the election of the room ... in the future will change a lot here. It's ridiculous how in recent years ... was dealt with the potential of the building. I can not go in there. Please, Otto Leonhard, we need Schmitti in size. You must tell the school board ... that you have enough students. Mr. Leonhard, please. - It's not working. - Serves me right. I'm really very sorry ... You can not bring better news ... but I am bound law and order here. Your school has simply too few students. Therefore, the closure of the school is without alternatives. Do you know what this Mario did to me? So what really does not come out of nowhere. So Mario's just. - A complete weirdo. - No. He has charged me for things ... I have done to you all. I'll disappear like Hulda Stechbarth. No one will miss me so that is all helped. No, so that's helped anyone. You need to go in there now and stop the school board. I have failed as a teacher. I can not lead this school. Stop! There are enough students! How dare you, reinzuplatzen here? I'm sorry, but it is really urgent. Here. Dr. Schmitt Gössenwein accepted me. Now there are enough students at the Otto Leonhard Gymnasium. You must not close the school. What's that for a children's theater? You would have at the signature ... really can give more effort. Do you really think Mrs. Schmitt Gössenwein ... had not appeared here yourself ... if she had to close the school want to prevent? If she could, she would have been safe. And what they should be in such an important matter ... prevent, intervene personally? She is... I can tell you. Your director has realized ... that they can not stop the course of events. That's why she has a promotion ... accepted into the school office. - What? She did not. - But. I gave her a promise ... on their application ... yesterday delivered in person. What? She has applied for a different location? This is a copy of the commitment. It is their right ... improve their professional development, do not you think?

I do not believe that. Come on. We've got to look for. Perhaps she has been injured. She's not in here because they already ... has a new job. Adults are only interested in their careers.

The spirit of Otto Leonhard defended his school. What? Why should defend a school a ghost? That you can buy your Babo ask. His father lets namely just close down. What babbles of there? The school is not closed. - It is only an elite school. - What? What does that mean? Why can you not even hear's friends ... - as he believed the situation? - Oh, you mean ...

All that? So much that we aufkriegen the closet. - It's done quickly. - Here we go. Come over here. My mobile phone. This is the rescue. Where am I? Good question. Yes, where are we here to do? Damn, this is hardly the net. Maybe I can still send a message. What's this? - Krass. - himself go ... - a puero. - Let it run ... - Through the child. - Through the child? - A puero.

Ella, we need a cube. Fast! - There's no dice. - But we need one. Or no. Bring me once the blue as the right, please. Felix, how far are you?

Robert, then green to. Mario, this red. - What "old" means? - very old. Which is from a time when the school ... not at stake. That's a long time ago. At that time I felt students only as an obstacle. - Yes and now? - I know that I give you ... will have to listen. Then it would not have come so far. I should have listened to you all better.

Yes we will... We will not close the school. What luck! Papa? Oh, Mr. School, I'm now but sorry. - You have to be honest. - Yes. I promise it. Mr. Leonard, I'm sorry. I beg you. - I admire you beyond measure. - Father. What you've built here, every elite school ... would be proud ...

Distinguished Director Schmitt Gössenwein ... would you be kind enough to say a few words ... to say the future of our school? Our school motto it has actually always been ... quite rightly said, it's just kind of ... lost part of it. "Let yourself be lead by the child." This realization I owe Felix Vorndran ... I would not have taken here by a hair ... although he really deserves to go to this school. Yes, we come to the next agenda item. Our school's founder, Otto Leonhard ... would probably say: "Let us all together a little bit ... have fun at our school. " Mr. Leonhard ... we can see the school ... not make a tiny bit elitist? And here, for example ... a classroom for some selected children ... from better ... No. You're welcome.
