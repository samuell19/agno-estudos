CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS A GUMMY PICTURES FILM TRAIN PRODUCTION EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JEONG TAE-SUNG THE TRUTH BENEATH Korea Party nominee Kim Jong-chan And 4-term independent candidate Noh Jae-soon In Daesan, a stronghold of the ruling party, the 21st General Election will usher in a generational change, or a change of parties. Look at all of you. Nice effort! Love that enthusiasm! Bet you had a lucky dream last night? Welcome, y’all! Come on in. Welcome, sir! Campaign Manager? Keep up the good work! Congressman, this is my mother. Oh, my! How do you do? Noh Jae-soon Dad, it’s Noh Jae-soon again. He never quits, does he? Min-jin! Imagine working 16 years for a guy like him? For 16 years you kissed my ass, and now the whole party’s gone over to you. That’s the level of our congressmen. Watch yourself, Jong-chan. Sir, I heard about your daily wake up calls. So it’s really true! Who’s that? Say hi to everyone! I had the speaker phone turned on, sir! How do you do, sir? Hello! Mom, I’ll be late tonight. What? You’ll be late? I need to finish my group art assignment. Look me in the eye. I’m doing it with Ja-hye. From today, you and Dad will be real busy, so I’m going to shape up and not cause trouble. Then pin Ja-hye’s number to your memo board. So what birthday present do you want from Grandma? That’s okay, you don’t need to buy one. Grandma, I want hundred thousand dollars. Anyway, I’m planning on throwing her a party. You’re going to win. In Daesan, when the Korea Party primary is over, people say the election’s over, too. So there’s not much campaigning for the main election. CANDIDATE #1 KIM JONG-CHAN But this year, circumstances are different. Let’s go to Sinsung District in Daesan. This place is the focus of attention after famous TV personality Kim Jong-chan unexpectedly captured his party’s nomination. CANDIDATE #5 NOH JAE-SOON The district previously served as a reliable source of votes for four-term lawmaker Noh Jae-soon. Sure enough, the Korea Party’s primary was a shocker. Candidate #5! Pundits see it as a strategy of Moon Hyun-sung, who is considering a presidential run next year. - Candidate #1! - Kim Jong-chan! - A new generation! - Kim Jong-chan! - A new politics! - Kim Jong-chan! - Candidate #1! - Kim Jong-chan! - A new generation! - Kim Jong-chan! - A new politics! - Kim Jong-chan! - Candidate #1! - Kim Jong-chan! - A new generation! - Kim Jong-chan! The number you’ve dialed cannot be connected. Please leave a message at the tone. ‘Ja-hye’ You have the wrong number. But, Ja-hye... Do you know a girl named Ja-hye? No, there’s no one named Ja-hye here. Min-jin’s Monster Mom She’s not here. I said she’s not here! God... No, we haven’t hung out for over a year! She’s having fun with her lover! Ja-hye? Never heard of her. Hello? Honey! There’s a problem. Min-jin hasn’t come home yet. Oh, my. Noh Jae-soon’s making trouble on his site. If we report her missing, then she comes back, we’ll have stirred up rumors for nothing. And it’s not the first time she’s run off. She’s been fine for 3 months. She’s quite the flirt. The boys must find her mighty sexy. Watch what you say about that girl. Did you hear something? Well, my ears ain’t stuffed with cotton. These photos are all from two years ago. She had a fight with her friends about something, a schoolmate reported her, and these were taken. Where the heck did he find these? Are you really from Jeolla Province? Yes. Well... It ain’t a sin, is it? Lighten up ma’am! Come over here. Right, lighten up! She promised me she wouldn’t do it again. But Ja-hye’s number was a fake, and her phone’s still turned off. Well, look at yourself... You conceal your hometown, and ambush us like this? You know how bad this regional rivalry is. Who’s ambushing who? Are you crazy? You think we’d just announce it? What are you so angry for? I ain’t angry, it’s you who aren’t making sense! - Who are you to...? - All the decisions here... ...are made by me. Listen up, shitheads! Is this your campaign? I know it’s sensitive, but let’s wait another day for Min-jin. "I’ll protect our children". This is your main campaign promise. Let’s wait one more day. No! She didn’t even bring an umbrella to school! Are you willing to lose the election over this? You won’t lose because your daughter ran off! We can’t underestimate Noh. Once he latches on, he’ll keep using this for sure. Right. She’ll be back. Her image is important, too. That’s no reason to worry. My goal isn’t to be a Korea Party member. There’s a Jeolla proverb, ‘A couple who buries their child spends a passionate night together.’ Meaning that if a child dies, the parents will make another one. A child’s death won’t kill the parent. The Korea Party milks you until you’re dry. Then, they’ll simply find a replacement. If we join forces later, people will feel betrayed. Are you comfortable with that? Wife Don’t be scared. War is waged with a smile. If you launch a new party, will you step down as leader? JA-HYE It’s ‘Ja-hye’. Ja-hye. I don’t know her last name. Third year, 11th class. Same height as Min-jin, her father’s a public servant. She has tortoise shell glasses, long legs... Her hair’s always messy. And she’s great at drawing. Did you see her? They’re best friends. I mean, did you see her, or talk on the phone? No. My daughter said she’s a great student. Ma’am, do you know a Bae Ok-soon? Ja-hye’s number... it’s the number of Ms. Bae Ok-soon. Lives in Gyeonggi Province. No. I don’t know her. Why is Kim Jong-chan hiding his wife’s hometown? These phone numbers here, they’re the kids my daughter hung out with. They’re all low-grade kids. If it’s of any help... Except for a hit-and-run homicide, there were no incidents that night. Where was the hit-and-run? An outer road by the New Town construction. The victim was a male, not from here. Do you happen to know a girl Choi Mi-ok? - Choi Mi-ok? - Yes. No. In telephone records, the person Min-jin called most wasn’t Ja-hye, it was this girl. Choi Mi-ok, Sinsung Middle School. Grade 3, Class 7. Never heard of her... Is there any problem with Min-jin? Same height as Min-jin. Tortoise shell glasses. Long legs, hair always messy. A civil servant father... that’s you. Kim Yeon-hong No, she said Ja-hye was a really great artist. I can’t draw, honey. Then who’s Ja-hye? JA-HYE PIANO SCHOOL I’m sorry. There’s no Ja-hye in Min-jin’s school. And no girl whose father is a public servant. And Min-jin didn’t have art homework yesterday. That’s right, Min-jin didn’t have any art homework. The signal from Min-jin’s phone switched off at 4:19pm. The location was at school. She was in class then. It’s possible her battery ran out. That’s Mi-ok. Min-jin stayed with Mi-ok at school until late. Because she had no umbrella. CHOI MI-OK (16) Min-jin and I left school late at night. I heard a car engine revving, so I looked. She got in a car and left. A white car. Don’t lie. My daughter doesn’t leap into strange cars. They seemed to know each other. A man or a woman? Could be a man... or maybe a woman. The license plate... I don’t remember. I checked all the nearby CCTVs, but couldn’t see them. What does your father do? He’s a driver. He loads shit in the back and drives it around. That’s called a sewage truck. Then, your mother? No mother. A stepmother. Just the three of you? I got a grandmother. She’s really sick. Two sisters. Two brothers. Where’d you get this? You know what this is? A watch. Your dad supports 8 people driving a sewage truck, and you own that? That watch was a gift to Min-jin’s dad. Min-jin changed the band and wore it herself. But after we moved here, it was stolen. It was too expensive to report to the police, you say this is yours? Fuck, it’s mine! Choi Mi-ok? The student Mi-ok? MISSING CHILD The detectives and journalists already asked about her. Because I’m Min-jin’s homeroom teacher, I guess. Yes, that’s right. I was her homeroom teacher last year. UM OK-RAN (46) But the detectives already talked to me. She had excellent grades. 1st year - class rank Her scores were very consistent. 2nd year - class rank Mi-ok and Min-jin were peas in a pod. In first year, they were in the same class. But teacher. That’s a lie. How can you call her grades consistent? Her grades transformed. No proof that girl swiped Min-jin’s watch, and telling the cops just makes more trouble. Should’ve left it be... Min-jin’s still gone. What do we do? I know it’s strange to bring it up now, but remember our school presentations on future goals? Sure, you wanted to be a first lady like Hillary. Crazy me said a good wife and mother. You were such a hottie back then. But where could Min-jin be? KIM JONG-CHAN Hello? Yes, you’re here? Nam Su-choong, violent crimes division. - I took over this case... - Let’s talk in the car. NOH JAE-SOON It was your wife who discovered she was missing? Yes. That was the first day of the campaign? Why continue campaigning after your daughter disappeared? You’ll just lose support that way. You want us to quit the election? No... it’s just frustrating. That sewage smell! I’ll open the window. What were you doing at the time she disappeared? What? What were you doing when she disappeared? I had an important meeting. Who was the meeting with? I can’t say. It’s a political matter. Just tell them, honey. Later, if it becomes a problem, I’ll tell you then. Remember when you rebelled and wanted to be a singer? Who does she take after, running around like this? She’s off having fun somewhere. The night she disappeared. Who’d you stay out so late drinking with? Is that so important? It’s hugely important. How important? Important enough to decide if I live with you, or not. What? If something ever happens to our Min-jin, what’ll you do then? A girl vanishes, and her father parades around campaigning. Why return to a home like that? I met someone I can trust. How can I talk when you look at me that way? AUTHENTICATION FAILED! CHECK YOUR ID/PW. Hello, how can we help you? Hello, my name is Kim Min-jin. I forgot my ID and password. What should I do? Fuck Fuck MIN-JIN AWESOME You have 53,660 unread messages. Min-jin, couldn’t you clean this up? HOME SHOPPING 10% SALE. OCTOBER 26... MIN-JIN HOW’VE YOU BEEN? My daughter Min-jin will surely return! I will never give up! People, when my daughter comes home, I will be the most steadfast and trustworthy father to her! MOTHER-IN-LAW Hello? Sorry to call so early. I’m the mother of student Kim Min-jin. Yes. How can I help you? We talked on the phone sometimes, since first year. The detectives already asked about it. That’s the day she disappeared. Ah, that’s payment day. This month I joined a savings club. As you can see, their singing is not exactly normal. I guess you had no idea. That she was so ostracized. Min-jin said, more than anything she didn’t want you to know. And her? They were both picked on. I still should have told you long ago. To be honest, I’m worried, too. - Help me, teacher. - Ma’am! She ate just a few mouthfuls of rice before leaving. I don’t know if she’s eating properly where she is. Help me. I’m sorry. That’s really all I know. Help me, teacher! My daughter vanished, but nothing has changed. Just one... the daily calls from Noh Jae-soon stopped. We couldn’t find any evidence linking Noh to your daughter. I knew it. No! This isn’t acceptable! Then show me all the investigation reports. That’s illegal, ma’am. I’d lose my job. Your husband would be smeared with this. Detective, you’re voting for Noh? If you leave Noh alone and something happens to my girl... I got something to do, come along. Ma’am, your stubbornness will get us in trouble. Now... look at a single dot. Take a deep breath, and let it out. PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH LAB Do your eyes sting? Take a deeper breath... There’s... there’s a white car There’s a woman talking to Min-jin. Her hair is tied up in a single knot. She looks pretty. She speaks Seoul dialect. What time is this? I don’t know. Do you see the numbers on the license plate? Where? Okay, let’s go back to when you first saw the car. It’s going by too fast. No. It’s going by slowly. Slowly... Seoul plate, 1...8...G... 8...5... I can’t see the rest. Where is she going? Min-jin? To Seoul? What will she do in Seoul? Be a singer. Hey, Min-jin went to Seoul? What? She went to Seoul to be a singer? Did I say that? Was she really hypnotized? Should we do it again? Don’t waste time with this. I’m leaving. Oh my. Shut up! Candidate 5! Noh Jae-soon! Candidate 5! Noh Jae-soon! She’s in here? PARK, CAMPAIGN MANAGER (45) What was my husband’s schedule on the first night of the campaign? He finished work and left at 2am. After that, I don’t know. His schedule on the first night of the campaign? Of course, I drove him. Just a minute. CHOI, DRIVER (46) Ah, it was at the Residence Hotel. Hotel? He went drinking there? With who? I think it was Shin Sun-mi of the New Politics Party. Though they left separately. I think that’s right. But ma’am... Is your hand all right? Why, shall I check it, ma’am? Maybe he really doesn’t know. Fuck that. Dude spent 16 years with douchebag Noh. Can’t trust no one in this lame ass city! Girl, what’s gotten into you? No, forget it. Help me to access the police file on Min-jin. I can’t do that. It’s illegal to open police files. You spent 16 years at Noh Jae-soon’s side, surely you know how to do it. Still, I can’t. Infringing personal privacy law... I’m sorry, ma’am. I’ll ask one last time. Do you really not know who my husband saw on that night? No, I don’t. I really don’t. Get me Min-jin’s police file. If you ditched Noh Jae-soon and came over to us, you need to prove that you’re trustworthy. Don’t think life’s so easy. Campaign Manager! I’ll tail her, don’t worry. Think... think... think... Screw your head on and think! Think... Go back to the beginning. First day of the campaign... My husband and I were distracted all day. Did Min-jin like the kimbap I made her? Somewhere... I heard the song she likes to sing. Do you have proof that he whistled? And do you have proof our daughter sang that song? It’s a wiretap. I knew it! That’s how he knew her song. Get rid of our wiretaps on Noh. We’ll use this against him. Take them out of his office, now! KIM MIN-JIN Ten days after the disappearance of Kim Jong-chan’s daughter, support for independent candidate Noh Jae-soon is surging. With Kim continuing to campaign despite his missing daughter, it seems unlikely he’ll see a return in his popularity. What’s in your heart? Are you begging for salvation? Are you begging for help? Please save her... Please save her... Unworthy mother, how can you keep your face and neck upright? Please save her... Please save her... My heart aches. My heart aches, my child. KIM MIN-JIN 1999. 10 ~ 2014. 10 Let’s meet in heaven, beloved daughter Moon Hyun-joong of the Korea Party, Governor Choi, and Daesan Mayor Park are all present. Other lawmakers came together with Moon. Independent Noh Jae-soon and New Politics Ja Chul-hee are also here Chairman Moon visited the bereaved family and urged Kim to continue with his campaign. What can I ever say to comfort you? With the missing Kim Min-jin returning in a coffin, the criticism directed at Kim is transforming into sympathy and support. As a wave of grief passes over the populace, some describe her as the girl who will save her father. The bell is ringing. Dingdong-dingdong. Skirt swishing, the crazy woman goes out with her bouquet. Out of the way. 10240 A pooping shooting star falling from a green sky. From the deep deep hole where you are, the sun don’t shine. Yeon-hong, open the door! - Fuck. - Are you okay? Honey! I was scared you wouldn’t forgive me no matter what. That day I met Shin Sun-mi of the New Politics Party. I know. You secured your future over drinks. It’s over between us. Honey, it’s not over. It’s over! I decide if it’s over or not! We’re through! I don’t give a shit about politics or elections! You killed my baby. Honey please, think rationally. Think rationally? The Campaign Manager might’ve killed my girl for the sympathy vote. Or did you hire someone, in order to win the election? I can’t trust anyone in this fucked up city! All of you in this insane city are rotten to your core! Fuck off! It’s not just you who lost a daughter! What if... What if... ...she really died because of me? 10240... 10240... 10240... 10240 10240 10240 The bell is ringing. Dingdong-dingdong. Skirt swishing, the crazy woman goes out with her bouquet. Out of the way. A pooping shooting star falling from a green sky. From the deep deep hole where you are, the sun don’t shine. Black as black, my meals taste worse than your cigarettes, my snacks, my soul. 10240 Did you really place 17th in the entire school? Min-jin’s grades kept going up. It was suspicious, but I wanted to believe. SINSUNG GIRLS’ MIDDLE SCHOOL The bell is ringing. Dingdong-dingdong. EXAM PAPERS Skirt swishing, the crazy woman goes FINAL EXAM, MATH -ATTACHMENT Jini and Oki, crying their heart out A pooping shooting star falling from a green sky. From the deep deep hole where you are, the sun don’t shine, black as black. 10240 Teacher, can I ask your email address? There’s something I need to send to you. I’m busy now, but I’ll call... That’s my email address. Choi Mi-ok is a suspect? The night Min-jin disappeared, someone saw Mi-ok all covered in blood. Ma’am. Mi-ok would never do something like that. I got it. Thanks, teacher. Fine, let’s assume you didn’t kill her. But if not, why is her blood on your sneakers? Look here... you see the black? That’s Min-jin’s blood right there. This blood and her DNA is a match. So don’t even think about lying. Once, Min-jin and I were crossing the street. A taxi ran a red light and came towards us, so I pushed her. She fell over then and skinned her knee. Her blood got on my shoes that day. Ma’am! Min-jin’s skirt was so short you could see her asshole! If she bled so much, why didn’t I see it? Tell the truth, you! Min-jin’s knee really was skinned, but we don’t know when. So please, calm down! When was it skinned? Ma’am. My daughter is not a criminal. Let’s go outside. Mr. Choi... you’re her father? What, all of you knew? Your daughter called my husband shit! She said her dad drives around a big load of shit! Why do you think she said that, Detective? You must have said the same thing at home! Why’d you pretend to be so nice to us? My daughter... would never say that for no reason. I haven’t done anything for her. She studies well on her own, and is a nice girl. Don’t make me laugh! She studies well? Get her out of here! For the past two years, your daughter has been cheating. Ask her. What this exam paper is. Get her out of here. If you’re through, please go. As her father, you should’ve known her grades were strange! You’re fired! Your husband really is shit! My daughter would never do that. Hey, asshole! Calm down! The illegal wiretaps in Kim’s home and office were planted by a member of Noh’s team. Independent candidate Noh Jae-soon. Kim is using unsubstantiated claims about wiretaps to slander me in this campaign. I’ll stake my political life on the truth. After Min-jin died, my husband’s ratings went up. The Campaign Manager got me the police files. Witness report, New Town site hit-and-run Some ways off, a girl in a school uniform was walking around with no umbrella. Looked like a ghost, I say. What’s she doing out in the rain, I thought. Then I saw her covered in blood, and smeared in dirt. So I said, “Whatcha doin’ in the cold?” Whatcha doin’ in the cold? But then she ran off. But there was so much rain. It was dark, and she was far off. Was it her... was it not her? I don’t think so. No, the girl wasn’t Mi-ok. No. The test showed no blood on Mi-ok’s school uniform. Tell me this is a different color from what it really is. Green. Good. Okay... We’re starting. Was your pride hurt that your dad was her dad’s driver? No. Did you bury Min-jin? No. Why’d you format your phone? Was there something you wanted to hide? It got wet that day, and stopped working. Just answer yes or no That’s why I formatted it. Did you kill Min-jin? No. Min-jin was just an annoying shit. KIM MIN-JIN When her dad came as a guest speaker, all the other kids must’ve felt it too. How much do you make? Do announcers earn a lot? Someone as famous as you? If you won’t get rich, you won’t be an announcer? Then how do you become an announcer? Oh, sorry. I stayed with my dad in Washington a few years. Are you mad? Don’t be mad. Fuck you. KIM PASSES NOH IN POLLS AFTER DAUGHTER’S DEATH BEREAVED MOTHER’S CONTROVERSIAL ATTIRE DID YOU COMPLETE YOUR TASK? AND THE PHOTO? This is driving me crazy. It is bad. In hospital, very, very more terrible. And after you must meet counseling doctor. Damn, you like Joan Feya? Joan Faye. Joan Faye. Joan Faye. Title, “Wild Rose Hill”. You wanna know a reliable way? The most reliable way is to jump from someplace high. This is great! INVESTIGATION RECORDS, MURDER OF KIM JONG-CHAN’S DAUGHTER My daughter’s account had over 50,000 emails. I found one email from two years ago. First year finals, she received the exam three days early. As you see, 10240 sent the exam. The subject says “omitted”. Forwarding something left out of earlier messages? So she forgot to delete it. These are her grades. From that semester, her scores shot up. And the same with Choi Mi-ok. They ranked among the top in the school. Then they continued to rank high. Now Choi Mi-ok is one of the suspects. Isn’t it suspicious? If your grades drop suddenly it’s a problem, but in the opposite case, no one suspects. My daughter’s bad at school like me. You don’t really think this is connected to her death? Why’d you send her the exams? I liked her. So you killed her? Are you crazy? Why would I? I really liked Min-jin. Then lead her down a good path, don’t help her cheat! It’s what she wanted. I only gave her the questions, she solved them herself. I don’t know about you, but she’s smarter than you think. If you tell the police, it will disgrace our dead Min-jin. Don’t you want to win the election? She was bullied when she was alive. Do you want people talking about her even after death? That night, there was only a hit-and-run homicide. What was the location? By the outer road of the New Town construction. The victim was male, not from here. Don’t move. If you move you’ll get hurt. The suspect in the assault on Kim’s wife is head of the Clean Citizens Group and a long-time supporter of Noh. On Noh’s homepage, the suspect posted 20 messages on KIims qualifications and her hometown. Sir, she’s awake. You had someone following me, right? I worried something might happen to you. This model is over 20,000 volts. Keep it with you. This is a permit to use it. Stun Gun Instruction Manual Don’t get hurt, darling. Our Min-jin wouldn’t want that, either. Thanks, honey. It may be that our daughter was not as nice as we thought she was. ...four five six seven eight nine ten eleven eleven and a half. Now, our party will start. October Free Time. Now we’ll always be together. The black night is coming. Now, the stars will shine brighter. Braid my hair Embrace my heart It’s time to go. Wild Rose Hill. Where butterflies fly Watch over my dream It’s time to go. Wild Rose Hill. That’s me I was the first one to become a fan. Why? Their song tells my story Do you want another video of Jini and Oki? This is one that I shot. Mi-ok would never do that to Min-jin. Mi-ok is the coolest girl I’ve ever met. We were really happy. Min-jin worried if she moved, Mi-ok would get picked on. To avoid that, you need good grades, and you need to dress smart. Mi-ok is really poor. CHOI MI-OK JO SO-YEON Jo So-yeon. Why’s your uniform so tight? Is that your style? What? WILD ROSE HILL BY JINI AND OKI One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 and 11 and a half! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 and 11 and a half! Now, our party will start. October Free Time. We’ll be together always. The black night is coming. Now, the stars will shine brighter. Embrace my heart. Embrace my heart. Braid my hair. Braid my hair. Protect my dream. Protect my dream. October Free Time. That’s the first day of Dad’s campaign. Since Mom and Dad were busy. This is the branch of a wild rose. Wild Rose Hill is where Minjin was found, Eleven and a half must mean 11:30. And 100 thousand stars? Money Min-jin wanted 100 thousand dollars for her birthday present. It was for your party, right? And the party was... And the party was... the money you got from the one who sent you exams. I know who she is. Min-jin’s the lyricist, I’m the composer. We don’t steal songs from other people. Your school uniform. I met Jo So-yeon yesterday. She was wearing your uniform. You surely washed it, but a test reveals everything. After my mom died, I only had my dad. Then he remarried and popped out those kids. All I had was Min-jin, so why would I kill her? Why? Okay you didn’t do it! But then who killed my Min-jin?! It was her! She hired someone to kill Min-jin. The phone of the bastard who killed Minjin. In here’s the number of the person who ordered it. It’s my fault Min-jin died. She was gonna give that money to me. Because my family’s poor, and Min-jin would study abroad. I drove that bastard’s car. Got in when he wasn’t looking. I hit him in the same way that he killed Min-jin. I learned to drive from my Dad. Backwards and forwards. Once, twice, three times. To the President of Korea, since Min-jin died and I could be next, I’m leaving this letter. The person who killed Min-jin and me is teacher Son So-ra from Sinsung Girls Middle School. The reason she killed us is that we have a video of her having sex with a man. Two years ago we gave her a car air freshener with a hidden camera inside. So for two years she sent exam papers to us. Finally we demanded 100 thousand dollars. And she hired someone to kill Min-jin. President, I beg you to please execute Son So-ra. It’s our final wish. Have a nice day. From Choi Mi-ok. If you’ve seen it, give me back the phone! No. No, give it back! I’m not stupid. I just pretended not to know about her grades. No, give it back! I’ll die without that. No matter what people say, I liked this city. It’s my husband’s hometown, and where Min-jin grew up. This was ordered by Kim Yeon-hong. Birthday Event Min-jin, we love you so much! - Mom and Dad That was a funny trick. My friend died, but I have the video. Let’s meet. The 21st General Election to the National Assembly begins shortly at 13,470 polling stations across the country. The voting period lasts from 6am to 6pm, and vote tallying begins thereafter. Eligible voters must show a national ID, passport, driver’s license or other officially issued ID. Locations of polling stations are printed in official voting guides... Honey, the person who killed Min-jin is not Noh Jae-soon. But you should keep insisting it was him. That he killed your daughter and broke your wife’s rib. Don’t be sorry to Min-jin, honey. Beat Noh Jae-soon for sure today. Kim Jong-chan Wanna know how much of a devil your kid was? I screwed up for just one month, but it’s going to stay with me forever. You fucking bitch! Until you die, you slutty bitch! When that bastard kid comes out in the world, I’ll tell everyone what a filthy bitch his mother is! When that fucked up kid comes out of your stinking cunt, I’ll make him regret the day he was born! What, are you wet now, you slut? Kim Jong-chan and Mi-ok’s teacher? I don’t know... I could be wrong. You know what? Your father and our teacher... SOMEONE’S DEMANDING 100 THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM ME. THEY HAVE A VIDEO OF US. WHO IS IT? I DON’T KNOW. Min-jin got killed by a hit man that her Dad hired. Why... Why didn’t you tell him it was our daughter? I wanted both of them to pay for it. Give me the video. Look, this is what you did. Call my husband. Someone who knows about us contacted me. I already took care of that. She wasn’t alone. Her friend saw her being killed. Fuck. I was told to stay out. She wants to talk to you. You know how boring my wife is? She’s frigid like a stone. Oh, baby... Fuck! You only killed Min-jin, you bitch! Watch out, you whore! I’m gonna get my revenge on you for Min-jin, bitch! If I kill you, then I lose. Live to pay for it. Honey Today... I beat Noh Jae-soon. HOMEPAGE OF NOH JAE-SOON UPLOAD VIDEO KIM JONG-CHAN CAR SEX TO MI-OK, BEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD. -MIN-JIN. Min-jin! Min-jin! Min-jin... Oh, Min-jin... Were you cold? It was cold, right? It’s me... It’s okay. It’s okay. Don’t cry. Don’t cry. Did my daughter say that she liked me? She said you were stupid. That her mother’s stupid. So she needed to protect her.
