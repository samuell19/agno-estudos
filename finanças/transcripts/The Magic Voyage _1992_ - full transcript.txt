(ominous music) (thunder booming) (pleasant music) (intense music) - [Narrator] A long time ago, people thought the world was flat, and if you sailed uncharted waters, you just might fall over the edge into space. This may sound strange to us now, but in those days, no one knew what lay over the far horizon, what with pirates, and hurricanes, and sea monsters to contend with. It was a very dangerous time, but in 1492, there appeared an Italian navigator, a man with a revolutionary idea. He thought that the world was square, and his name was Christopher Columbus. (gentle music) - Geronimo! (water splashes) (gulls squawk) Let go, who turned the lights out? (gull yelling) Hey, let go! Let go of me you crazy fish! (gulls laughing) Me and my mouth, oh, hey! Hey, you, come on, get this fish off my face, would ya? Whoa. - It's mine! - Says who? - It's mine! - What you mean? - It's not yours, let go! - Ouch, whoa. - Lunch, oh. - Look out below!

(gull grumbling) - Watch your head, sorry. (worm grunting) Pretty steep climb here. No big deal, I like it. - Worm at 10 o'clock. (plane engine roaring) (gull grunting) - [Man] My goodness, this navigating is so hard. - [Gull] Just wait. - Let's see, I sail it to India, and then I make a left, and then oh, when I get to Africa, she's upside down, oh. (speaking foreign language) My map, she's so stinky. How come a genius like me is so stupido? All the time, people say to me, face it, Chris. It's 1492, and the world, she's still flat, ow! Ah, navigation. (Christopher grumbling) I'm a-wasting time with those stupid cubes. I'm gonna play marbles. Oh well. Maybe it's not so important. - Not so important? Are you kidding? Let me show you something. Excuse me, pardon me. - Oh! Hm, look what you do to my... Ha, maybe the world she's, she's round? Say! - Course it's round, blockhead. What do you think? - I don't know, seems a little far fetched to me, and yet? Hmm, ah, say! It might work at that. Grazie, little? - Pico the wood worm, at your service. - [Christopher] And I'm Christopher Columbus, put it there, pal. - Great to meet you. - Hey, how does a wood worm get to be so smart? - I've eaten a lot of libraries. - Yeah? Hey, I think I like to show you something. I think you're gonna like it a lot, too. Let's see. Oh no, that's not it. No, that's not it. So that's what happened to Fishy. (Christopher gasps) There it is! One of my favorite bedtime stories. Okay, here we go. It's called "The Indies on 5,000 Lira a Day" by Marco Polo. - [Pico] I've played that game. - Now this Marco Polo guy, he went to the Indies a long time ago. He traveled by land. Now just between you and me, Pico, I think he went the wrong way round the block. Because if someone took a ship from here, to bella Espana, and followed the sun across the sea, he'd bump into the Indies in no time. And you can't fall off the edge, now that the world is round. Yes, the world is round! (gull squawking) (Christopher laughs) Okay, so I'll just put on my hat, and we go tell the king and queen. I got the brains, but they got the money. (both laughing) I just hope they'll be as amazed at me as I am. Now, what do we need? Charts, the globe, the course for the expedition, okay. Okiedokie, Pico. Away we go! - Oh boy.

(Christopher humming) Excuse me, excuse me. - Do you mind? - I suppose you're wondering what I got here. - You know, I couldn't really care less! - Attitude adjustment. - No, no, no, no, no, no. If you say she flies, then she flies. - M-m-m-my sire, I'm afraid she's not quite ready. - Not ready, not ready? Did you hear that, Stupendo? He said he's not ready. - Mm-hmm. - Look, I'm ready! He's ready! (foghorn blares) You're ready! Ready? - Bye-bye. (people yelping) - It's ready. - It is ready. - Wow, what do you know? I'm ready. Whee! (upbeat music) Oh no, no! No, no! (dramatic music) - I guess he wasn't ready. Next! - I'm outta here! - Not me! (man yelling) - [Pico] There goes the tough guy. - [Stupendo] You, you're next. - Help me, someone! - [Ferdinand] Come on, come on now. You think I have all day? - I'm so sorry, your majesty I, oops. (Ferdinand sighs) - The world is filled with such idiots, Diego. - Oh so true, sire. They don't deserve your kindness, your patience. - Indeed. Well, speak you moron! - [Pico] Come on Chris, give it to him, your esteemed royal majesty. - Your steamed up royal majesty, I'd like you to be first to- - The first what? - The first to hear my brand new theory which will make you great beyond your wildest dreams. - Oh, is that so? - [Christopher] Oh yes. - And what makes you think I'm not already great beyond my wildest dreams? - Now, now, your highness. Perhaps he has some information we, you could take advantage of. Although he looks like an imbecile, I grant you. - As you know, it's a pretty big deal to go over the land, and the Turks, ooh, they don't like it so much. - Yes, so what? - So, it's stupid to go east to get east when you can go west to get east, because the world, this is the fabulous part, your majesty, she's round! (Pico yelping) Ain't that a kick in the head? (Ferdinand growls) - I'll give you a kick in the head! Of all the stupid, ridiculous, insane, out, out, before I roast your head on a stick! - Please, don't be so hasty, sire. Mightn't this be a lovely opportunity for some entertainment? (Ferdinand laughs) - Things would be so boring around here without you, Diego. Guards! Get them out. I'll teach you not to waste my valuable time. - Hey, you guys, watch, hey, don't bend the suit! - Ferdi? - Look, oh. (Ferdinand laughing) - What is it, darling? What a pleasant surprise. What are you doing up so early? - All your lousy screaming woke me up. Oh, who's this? - No one, dear. Just another genius, you know. - What, I don't believe you. He's much too handsome, muah. - Oh, but I am a genius, your greatness. (Pico grumbling) (foot tapping) - Fascinating. So tell me, what can little Izzy do for you? - I forget. - Hey, snap out of it and ask her about the ships. - What? Oh, yes, yes, right. I need three ships, your majesty. - Three ships? - Uh-huh. - Are you going away? But you only just got here. Oh no. - Yes, yes, I found a new route to the, oh! Spices, gold, jewelry. - Ooh, jewelry. Ah, why didn't you say so? We got too many lousy ships, anyway. - Well, I really think- - Shut up! And you'll need money, of course. (Isabella giggles) Maybe this will help. - It will! Oh, your majesty, what a lovely symbolic- - Ah! Not so fast! I just happen to know your compass is out of whack, sailor boy. If you start here, and go splish splishity splash, you'll fall off the stupid edge. - [Pico] Whoop, got it. (both gasp) - Something smell fishy here. - It's unbelievable! - Hey, Columbus, it's just me. - Pico, it was you all the time. So, now highnesseses, I not so stupid as I look, huh? - Well, now let's not get carried away. - Have some respect! Don't you know a miracle when you see one? - What? Miracle? - We have so much to talk about. (pleasant music) - [Christopher] Oh yeah. - There's this darling little shop in Tranglais which has the most delectable little trinkets. - What, like cupcakes? - [Isabella] You simply must go. - [Ferdinand] Isabella, dear, you've already had two new palaces this year! I'd have to raise taxes! (crickets chirping) (pleasant music) (people laughing) - Ooh, you're one heck of a man. So brave! Imagine, risking your life like that. Oh, this really gets to me. And you're getting to me, too, really, muah. - Pathetic. - I bet you say that to all the explorers. - Listen, there's a lot of exploring to do right here. - [Christopher] This little piggy went to- - I'm goin' for a walk. Don't be out too late. - What a disgusting display. But, don't let it get to you, sire. He'll have his ships, yes. But, we know he's not coming back. (both laughing) - One thing bothers me, big boy. When I think of you out there on that cold, lonely ocean, rocking back and forth, tossing and turning with the waves, I feel like... (Ferdinand grumbling) - Okay, explorer genius, bon voyage, arrivederci, have a nice time! But if you don't bring back gold, your head will be on a platter! Come, Diego, we must arrange a suitable sendoff for our friend. (Pico whistling) (ominous music) - Hey, that looks pretty cool. Guess it's time for a hike. NNice castle. Always wanted one of these. (Pico grunting) Hey. Hey, that looks pretty cool. Oh, a trampoline. Ha, I like it. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, oh didn't work, oh, oh, watch out, watch out. Woo, saved by the bell. Whoa, hey, these are pretty cool. I look stupid. (Pico burbles) Glad nobody can see me making a fool of myself. (Pico burbles) Whoa, this is stupid, this is fun. This is stupid, this is stupid fun. Whee. (Pico burbles) (fairy giggles) Hello? Oh, I think I've been busted. What is that? Oh my god, oh, it's a flying squirrel. What is it, hello? It's a girl, hey. Oh, look at me, I look stupid again. Look, there I am. Anyway, come on out. Show yourself. Whoa. (gentle music) - Who calls me from my solitude? - Me, Pico. - Pico? I've never seen an insect like you before. - Oh, well that's not surprising. (fairy gasps) You see, I'm a wood worm. I'm not an insect at all. - A wood worm? What would a wood worm want with this chandelier? It's all crystal and gold. - Well, I was just playing. - Oh. - What's your name? Wait, where you going? - I'm called Marilyn, princess of the kingdom of moon sprites. - A princess? - I was in the land of blue, blue twilight, where the nectar is always sweet, and the moon was as bright as the sun. And the night as glorious as the day. Ours was the land of beauty, and enchantment. Of silver waterfalls, and crystal rivers with perfumed flowers spread like a rainbow carpet all around. (dramatic music) (Marilyn giggles) We flew on the warm, and gentle breezes. Happy and free! (Marilyn giggles) And then, from a land far away, an insect army of fear and dread. (insects buzzing) When their evil lord saw me, I knew there was no escape. - At last, princess, the secret of your magic light will be mine. With this power, I shall become invincible. You will tell me everything. So no one will dare stand against the swarm! - [Marilyn] There's no escape, nothing that I can do. Here must I stay, until I agree to his demands. I tried to explain that our magic light will not work in the hands of evildoers, but he refused to listen, and brought me here to this crystal prison. - You're alone here. You could run away, fly back home! - No, beyond the chandelier, it's dark, and I'm afraid. - Hey! Who's that little guy? - And he has guards waiting, watching. I've heard them. - Yeah, well, listen to me. Just follow my lead, I'll take care of 'em. I'll give 'em a left, and a right. - But no, you can't fly? - Okay, come on, let's go. I'll show ya how it's done. - It's too risky! - Great, no, we're going this way. - If the swarm lord comes back- - Nah, I'm not scared of nobody. I'll just beat 'em up, I'll kick 'em in the head. I'll get 'em right where I want 'em. - Pico, you're silly. - Come on! - [Marilyn] Whoa! - [Pico] Here we go. (ominous music) - What, what, what is this? She's escaping! Come on, wake up, she's getting away! - What, where? - Sound the alarm! Let's get him! - It sees us. - And look, we've been spotted. - Attack, attack! (insects grumbling) - Wait, wait, give her back! Hey, give her back! Hey, take that! (all grumbling) Missed the attempt, take that! As for you! Whoa! - Get them! - Pico! (Pico groaning) - Oh, double drat! - Wow, Marilyn. That was a pretty good catch. - Oh, that won't be the last of them, I'm afraid. - [Insect] The swarm, the swarm! We must get the swarm, yes! - Fear not, fair lady. I'm here to protect you. (Marilyn giggles) (swarm buzzing) (Marilyn gasps) - [Marilyn] It's the swarm lord! - [Pico] Quick, get behind me. - Where do you think you're going, my dear? It is time, princess, for you to give me your power. - You don't know who you're messin' with. - What did you say to me, you little worm? - Oh my god, quick, come on, run, quick! - [Swarm Lord] The princess is mine! (Pico groans) You will be my prisoner in my kingdom in the west. - Come back! Oh, Marilyn. I'll find you. All the way across the ocean. (dramatic music) (people chattering) (pleasant music) - Hello, darlings, hello! - You're too kind. Thank you so much. It's my first parade, haha. I love, thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you, so much. You're too kind, you're too kind, I love you, all of you. Thanks a lot. (people cheering) - Hear ye, hear ye! - Yay, thank you, grazie. (speaking foreign language) Ciao, baby! - [Diego] Unprecedented journey begins from our shore! - Cheers! - Columbus will attempt to cross the vast ocean, meet with enormous peril, he will surely encounter. On this historic voyage, he will claim all lands twixt here and the Indies for the greatest rulers on Earth, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella! - Mama would be so proud of me, haha, yeah. - I christen this ship the Santa Maria. - And you're not gonna be disappointed because I know just what I'm doing. - I can see them now, sire. You know, falling off the edge of the world. (Ferdinand laughs) (bugle fanfare) (birds chirping) - What? Who? Marilyn! Wait, Columbus! Wait, don't leave me. Hey, wait for me, Pico, your old friend! Whoa. A bumpy ride, oh. What? (gentle music) What is that? Hello? - Beat it. How do you do? - Just fine, how you doin'? - [Bee] Just fine, thanks. - Wow, I wish I could fly. I'd be able to get there so much faster! Hey, pretty cool, a parachute. Whoa, this is fun! All this flying, I should start my own airlines. Wow, this is great! I'll be there in no time. Spain, huh? (pleasant music) (Pico grunts) All right, hey, get off of me, who is that, leave me alone, ah! All right, all right, I'm on my way! Columbus, don't leave without me! Don't forget who told you the world was round! I'm on my way, I'll be there in no time at all. I'm gonna be, whoa! (Pico gasping) I can't, whoa. Wait, I'm a worm, I can't swim, ah! Help! (eerie music) - Well, well, who do we have here? (ominous music) - Hey, let me go. - Ooh, let me see. - Maybe it's something to eat. - No, I'm not- - Forget it, this one's mine. - Dream on, pal! - All right, guys. Let's talk. I'm not cheese, I'm a worm. - You're disgusting. - Here, you can have him. - No thanks, I'm dieting. - Speaking of diets. Whoa! By the way, did I mention that I know where there's a big ship with lots of food? - [Rats] Food? - Tell us now, where exactly is this food? - Yeah, where's the food? Where's the food? - I'm starving! - Well, there's a big ship in the harbor. If you hurry, you can still catch it. - Food! - Whoa! (water splashes) Hey, get me outta here! I can't swim, I'll drown! - Thanks a lot, runt. - You're welcome. - By the way, runt, you better not be lyin'! (rats chuckling) - Wait, wait, wait, I need a ride, I can't swim! (bugle fanfare) (crowd cheering) - The voyage, she begins! So, let's set sail. - Ahoy there, mateys! Release the sails! - Release the sails! - Release the sails! - Release the sail! - Prepare to cast off. - Aye aye, captain! (dramatic music) - Hurry up, you goose. They're not gonna wait on us, you know. - [Rat] Don't stand there talking about it, there's food, food! - Shut up. - [Christopher] Hey, time to move! - Aye aye, captain! - Raise them up with the anchor! (rats yelling) - We made it. (gears creaking) - Julias, do you think that you could possibly give Gutter here and me a hand? - Yowch! Ow, ow! (rats grunting) - Thanks, pal. - [Julias] Yow! (Pico grunting) - Adios, Espana! Oh, don't make my statue too big. I get embarrassed, you know? (pleasant music) Oh. Hey queen lady, this great explorer will return. Do be sure. - He's going away, Ferdi. I'm, I'm going to miss that wonderful, that, that- - Columbus! - Yes, Columbus. (Pico whistles) - [Pico] Hey! - You know, I got this funny feeling that I forgot something. Ah, there's my globe. Go, globe! (Christopher laughing) Now I remember. It was, gah! How could I forget about Pico? - Pico? - Sure, my little wood worm friend. - Wood worm? You have a wood worm for a pet, on a wooden ship? - Hey, this guy is more than a pet. He is the one who told me the world was round. Did you know the world was round, Geraldo? - Holy moly. - Hey, you in there, buddy boy? Hey, Pico, hey Pico, where are you? - Hey, wait Columbus! Columbus, come back! (Pico panting) Columbus, oh, what'll I do? I'm all verklempt. I can't take it. This is horrible. Hey, what's that? Hey, wait! Hey, hey, you stupid bird! Come here! (Pico babbles) Come on, I got something for you. (Pico babbles) Come on, come and get me ya big rat, ah! (Pico grunting) How you like that one? - [Gull] Hey, get out of the way, I can't see. Hey, what are you? No, hey, what are you doing back there? Oh now you're done. You pulled off my stabilizer! - Ah, there we go. Direct you right towards the ship. Yow, wait! (water splashing) Oh, I can't believe this! This is horrible. (Pico grunting) Ah, perfect, this is perfect! Ah, this is much better. I can just take a nice little walk, and just walk right over to the ship. Something- - Hey, boys. What have we got here? - What do we have here, what do we have here? - It's that yucky worm! - Hi, guys. - You lied to us. - You lied, you lied! - Yeah! - I didn't lie, I was just merely- - You didn't say nothin' about sailing off the edge. - Off the edge, off the edge. - We didn't find no food, none! (Pico yelling) (water splashing) - I guess I won't need to pay for those swimming lessons. Hey, who said anything about off the edge, anyway? - Some of the sailors, that's who. - They got a loony for a captain. - So we're gettin' out while the gettin's good. - Yeah, we're gonna take the dingy back to shore. - No, if the crew sees you're leaving, then they'll mutiny. - Who cares? - So what? - Wait, but if you leave now, you'll never get to the land of the big cheese. - [Rats] The big cheese? (rats shouting) - That's different. - Let's go! - Let's go boys, come on! (rats laughing) - [Pico] Time to hitch a ride. (pleasant music) - Ah, I miss you my little friend, Pico. I wonder what he sees in this stuff, anyway? (Christopher belching) Mm, not much in taste, but seems high in fiber. (Christopher munching) (someone knocking) I'mma coming! (ominous music) Ghost? Pico, my friend, where you been? - Reporting for duty, sir. - I thought maybe you got left behind, alley oop. - Well, I met this beautiful girl, sir. - Ah. - Her name's Marilyn. I really like her a lot, but she was taken away by the evil swarm lord to his kingdom in the west. - To the west? But we go to the west to get to the east, so we can look for your love, my little one. (Christopher laughs) (Pico chuckles) - How convenient. - Look at this! I brought your house with me. - Oh, very good. That was good thinking. - Not very homey, is it? Ooh, what a mess. - I'd better work on that a little bit. I haven't had time for any house cleaning lately. Okay, let's start here. Now let's put a staircase, yeah. Slide down banister, very nice. I always liked it. Okay. Careful. Desk there. Bed for sleeping. Thing for clothes, a piano. - Bravo! - Okay, let's see, a little fireplace with this little picture of Marilyn. Maybe a picture of Marilyn. A third little picture of Marilyn. I like Marilyn. Anyway, a chandelier kinda thing. That's very nice. (Pico panting) Oh! Woo. A recliner. - Bellissimo! Oh, very tasteful. (suspenseful music) (water splashing) - Well, what's he doing? - He, he's talking to his globe. No, no wait a minute, he's talking to his little worm. - What did I tell you? He's crazy! - Now, now he's kissing the little worm. - A little what? - No, maybe you believe me when I tell you. - Now what's he doing? - Who, Columbus or the worm? - Columbus, you idiot! (glass squeaking) - Hey, wait a minute, I don't see him. - Well, hurry up, will you? I can't hold onto you guys- - Geraldo! (sailors yelling) (water splashing) (Christopher shouting) What was that? - What was what? - What was what, that scream! (Geraldo whimpers) - Maybe we ran over fish? - Oh, that's different. If we ran over a fish, then somebody else should drive. (Christopher chuckling) - [Sailor] Oh dear, oh dear, my hat. Quick, drop the rope! Heave. - Heave. - Heave! - Heave! - Heave! - Heave! - Heave! (Geraldo grunting) (sailors shouting) - [Sailor] Get your foot out of my face, you! Come on you, you're standing on my hair. - You know, I never was really a big fan of wrestling. (Christopher chuckles) - Boys will be boys. - Crazy! - Oh, touchdown. Oh boy, am I hungry. Fish heads. Fish heads? Whoa! Hey, these are better than fish sticks. (gull chomping) (pleasant music) - Ah, bellissimo ocean! It's in my blood. The magic of the sea! You feel that motion, Geraldo? The rolling, and the pitch. Oh, oh, oh! (Christopher groaning) Geraldo, I love the sea. - Oh, captain. - But the sea, she don't love me, see? I gotta put my head down and my feet up, and I'm gonna dream of land. (somber music) (Christopher snoring) (Christopher laughing) (intense music) The great Christopher Columbus. Hero, explorer, genius, scans the distance. Oh, look at him. The Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria watch out! It's the queen, Isabella, give me a kiss, ah. Yes sir, I'm ready, here I come! Ready or not, one, two, three, four! Oh wait! Okay, get ready! Pucker up! Whoa, oh my goodness. Gimme kiss, I'm gonna, oh I'm ready. - Muah. - Okay. I don't, whoa. I just, oh almost fell off. The edge of the Earth? Oh no, not him, help! (Christopher screaming) Let me outta here! (Ferdinand growling) (metal clanking) What am I, the tooth fairy? (Christopher yelping) Wait a minute, this can't be happening to me! I'm Christopher Columbus, the great explorer! This must be a dream! Ah, yes. It was a dream. (pleasant music) (waves lapping) - Time to take a look around. - [Sailor] Nuts, he's crazy! - [Sailor] Then you all agree, eh? - [Sailor] He's nuts! - Hey, let's see. - Nutty like a fruit cup. - These guys are up to. - Hey! I never dreamed he was actually serious about trying to sail all the way to Asia. - I promised my mother in Seville one of those big fans. - Yes, I heard they're great souvenirs. Real cheap, too. - Do you nitwits actually think we're going to get there? Don't you get it? Asia's the other way! We're heading right for the edge. - You mean my mom is not going to get her silver mirror? - That's right, brilliant. - Well, what do we do? - Simple. We'll mutiny! - Mutiny? - Shh! - But how? - Kch. (Pico gasps) - I don't like that. I'd better go tell Columbus. - What's the rush, drill bit? - I ain't got time for you right now. - Ooh, look. I'm so scared. - Oh. (rats chuckling) - All right you guys, put me down, or you're gonna pay. - You're not worming your way out of trouble this time, pipsqueak. - Hey, you ever used to watch sports cartoons? (rat yelling) - Why, you little- - See you later! (rats shouting) - Come on, Ritso! - Let's go, come on! - [Rat] Would ya move it, kid? - Ah, you stupid rat! - Hey, where'd he go? - Good luck, this way, here we go! (rats shouting) I'm going around. (rats shouting) You can't catch me, you know. - I think we're gaining. - Come on, oh yeah, you're gettin' there. That way, oh by the way, did I mention that there's this whole big pile of cheese back there? - Oh gee, thanks! - [Rats] What, what, what are you doing? (rats grunting) (Pico laughing) - Stupid rats. - We're not your friends, and we're not finished with you! - Off of me! - I'm a thinking you worry too much.

Goodnight, seagull. Goodnight, Rafael. Goodnight, Cosmo. (Christopher sputters) Goodnight, my good friend, Sonodoro. Don't let the bedbugs bite. - Ah, a nice little dream. I like dreaming.

She loves me, she loves me, she loves me not? - Oh, Pico. - What kind of a dream is this? She's going away. - [Marilyn] Pico. - This isn't a dream, this is a nightmare. Where's Marilyn? Marilyn, come back! (somber music) I don't know what to do. Oh, I could chop down a million trees and still not have my love. What's that? - I love you, Pico. - Marilyn! You do love me, you do love me! Ah, this is amazing! (pleasant music) (Marilyn giggling) Ah, this is great. Orbiting above the Earth with the girl of my dreams, literally. Whee!

Where's the Bronx? - Over there. - Where's what? - Land, I told you so! And some of you guys didn't believe me, huh? - He didn't. - He didn't. - He didn't. - No, he didn't! - Think of all that gold! - The souvenirs! - And Marilyn. - It's the land of the really big cheese. - Big cheese, big cheese! - Food! - Look! - That's a dock! - We're gonna fall off the edge. - The edge, the edge! (ominous music) - Twist, jam, monster, what is it? (eerie music) (rats yelling) - Wait, where are you guys going? (Pico groaning) Wait. Oh, this is quite a ride. Wait, if you leave, the crew will mutiny. Where are you going? Wait, you guys, stop. Hold on, wait! - Land of the big cheese, yeah right. Let go of my tail. - No, no more water! (water splashing) (rats grunting) - [Rat] Follow me, hey, follow me guys, I'm outta here. - Whoa. - Listen, boys, let's not get carried away. - [Sailors] Mutiny! - No, mutiny, you don't like- - Mutiny! - Everybody makes a mistake once in a while. Come on! Come on, boys! Nobody's perfect. Ooh, oh did I tell you that I was allergic to rope? - Don't worry, Columbus! - When we find all that gold, I'm gonna give each and every one of you a raise! Ah, don't take me so literally! - I'm on my way. What can I do, a little worm like me? Wait, I got an idea. (Pico drilling) - Okay, you can have a raise, plenty! But I'm not gonna die! You're not gonna get nothing! You'll desert just like me! This isn't right, I'm tellin' ya- - [Pico] I'm coming, keep your pants on. - Worm, tell 'em. - Chris, come here. - Hello, my little friend. What are you doing up here? - Columbus, I'm gonna save ya. I'mma eat through the rope. - Oh, that's not a bad idea. I'm goin' down! I always said you was one smart worm. Hey, I see land. Look, over there! No, I'm serious, I see land! Boys, boys, look over there! I see it, land! I never gave you any reason to doubt me! (Christopher yelling) (wood crashing) - Whoa, shaky, whoa, whoa! (Pico yelling) There's that foot again. - [Christopher] Pico! Are you all right? - That was close. - [Rats] Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke. - Yeesh, I'm gonna have a stroke all right. Where we goin' anyway, huh? - How should I know? - Hey, what if we're goin' the wrong way? - Huh? - We could be goin' towards the edge. - Not to mention that storm cloud. (insects buzzing) - Hey, wait a minute. That's no storm cloud. - Whatever it is, it'd heading right for Santa Maria. I say, we go back. - What for? - Something screwy is happening, that's what for. And, well, I, I feel kinda bad about how mean we've been to that little wood worm guy. (emotional music) - What, are you nuts? - Nuts, nuts. - If you wanna go back, fine, but count us out. Hmph. (ominous music) (shark yowling) (rat screaming) Whoa, are those sharks? (insects buzzing) (sailors grunting) - [Sailor] Oh, blimey! (insects buzzing) - The swarm lord. - [Swarm Lord] Travelers! Who dares to approach our beach? - I dare, I've come to rescue Marilyn! - Nonsense, why if it isn't that ridiculous book worm. (Swam Lord laughs) - Go ahead and laugh, I'm not afraid of you. - Oh we shall see. (Christopher yelping) (Pico yelling) Scared now? Destroy the ship! (insects buzzing) - Let me off of here! (sailors yelling) - [Christopher] Grab your hats, here they come again! (Swarm Lord yelling) - [Sailor] We are going down, help! - Look at all that gold! Who's driving the ship? Wow! (wood crashing) (gull yelling) I, whoever I am, claim this land in the name of what's her name? - Hooray, Columbus! - Hooray, hooray! - We've made it, boys! I told you not to worry. Everything good be. (Christopher groaning) (ominous music) (birds chirping) - Are you awake, my dear? (Swarm Lord laughs) I have some good news for you. We've decided to set you free, but first you must show the secret of your magic light. - It's impossible. I've already told you that. - Nothing is impossible, princess. Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, I've just seen your pathetic little worm. - He's here? - Oh, yes. Lying dead in the water. (Swam Lord chuckles) - Oh, Pico, oh. (birds chirping) (beaver humming) - My house! (beaver yells) Hey, you. Did you do this to my house, huh? Gee, are you okay there, little fella? (Pico groans) - [Pico] Marilyn. - No, Bob. Bob the beaver. - Oh, sorry. I think I'm Pico the wood worm, I think. - A wood worm? No foolin'! Say, pal, you know, you don't look so hot. Hey, are you hungry? I've got wood. Boy, do I got wood. Or would ya prefer a nice piece of ship? - Yeah! (Pico chomping) Woo! Thanks Bob, I needed that. - Hey, Puko! So where's the big cheese, huh? - Who are those guys? - Eh, they're just a couple of irritating rats, that's all. - One less irritating rat these days, Puko. - Yeah, thanks to that stupid- - Watch it! - Swarm. - Swarm? - Yeah, it knocked Ritso out cold. - Poor Ritso. Ow! - And it's got my girlfriend. - Ah, boy that really stinks! Let's go get 'em. Ever since that darn Swarm Lord guy came, there's been nothin' but trouble for all of us. (all grunting) Hey! What the heck is that? - That's my friend, Columbus, captain of the Santa Maria. - Oh, captain huh? (rats chuckle) I'll be your captain, okiedoke? - Yeah. - Sure. - Great, buddy. Hey, by the way, Bob, what's a beaver doin' in a tropical dump like this, you know? Aren't you beaver guys used to sloppin' around in icy ponds or something? - [Bob] Oh you know that's a really, really interesting story. - I bet. - I was putting the finishing touches on the biggest darn dam you've ever seen. - That's fascinating. - Then, this teeny weeny itsy teeny weeny eenie gnat landed on it, and then, bam! When I woke up, I was just off the shore of this here island, and that's the truth. - Island? - Yeah, it's a really teeny weeny itsy teeny itsy bitsy small- - Ah, knock it off. - Hey, Pico! - What? - Hey, Pico! How's tricks? We made it! And they said it couldn't be done. We really found the route to Asia, yippee! - Wait, Columbus? I think there's something we should talk about. I don't really- - Did you see the big pagoda with all that gold? - Yeah, but- - Gold, Pico! - If you say so. Heh, oh god, I've gotta get outta here. - [Christopher] Pico, my friend, where you go? (Pico whistles) - Wait, wait, wait for me, Bob, wait, wait! - Bob? Hey, come back with my hat you big, fat rat! Wait for me! Hey, Pico! Hey, Bob! Where'd they go? Pico! Oh, I uh, oh. I, hm, ah. (Christopher gasps) There it is, the gold! - Sure, that's where we're goin'. - In, in, in there? Unsupervised? - Don't worry, Christopher. Bob knows the way. - You guys go ahead. I think maybe I better stay here and protect the Nina. And who needs all those creepy crawly jungly wungly things, anyway? Yuck. On the other hand, what am I crazy or something? I can't let you guys go in there all alone. - Ooh, what's the matter with him, huh? - [Christopher] Oh, you sure this leads to the g-g-gold? - [Pico] And Marilyn? - Trust me. - Wow, I bet there's some pretty cool animals here, like lions, and tigers, and bears, oh my. - Lions, tigers, and bears? - I don't know. - These are pretty cool trees. I've never seen trees like this before, or eaten 'em for that matter. - Aren't they cool? Taste good, too. (Pico drilling) - Mm, mm. That was gross! I hated that tree, not! - How very nice for you. Where's all the garbage? That's what I'd like to know. - Listen! (Christopher whimpering) Nice beat. That'll go over big some day. Let me outta here! (birds chirping) - I hope you're not tellin' us we're goin' up there. (rats grunting) Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. (rats grunting) - Sorry, guys. I had a big lunch. - Maybe you could chew thinner trees. - Here I come. Watch out, sorry, sorry. Had to get first. - Oh, that's funny. I don't remember auditioning for this circus. - There you go. Now, only 187 to go. - Look, skulls! (eerie music) - Don't worry, they only eat humans. (suspenseful music) - You guys, slow down! I better start going to the gym. (Christopher panting) (skeleton rattling) Hey, I better stop it because soon I'll look like, ah! (Christopher shouting) (all chuckling) Ah, let me outta here! Oh please, I wanna go home, Mommy! Ooh the gold! - It's her, it's Marilyn! Come on! - We're with ya. - Here come the swarms. - [Pico] Marilyn! - What, could it be? It is, Pico! I knew he would come. - What? That's impossible. The wood worm is dead! - He's here, Swarm Lord. - Not yet, my dear. I shall cover your light. Now he sees you, now he won't. - Hey. - Where did she go? - So who turned off the gold? - He's done something to Marilyn! - Pico, wait! (rats grunting) - Wait, wait, just wait 'til I get my hands on that- - Careful, Pico! It's too dark- - Find the way! (all yelling) - To see! - Hey, hey, no running into the jungle! Somebody's liable to get hurt, like me! - What's he hanging up there for? - Do you ever have one of those days? Oh, get me down! Help me, help! - Gosh, what are we gonna do? - Ready, boys? - Yeah. - Uh-huh. - [Pico] Sounds like a good plan. Okay, come on. (saws buzzing) - No, no, no! Don't chew my tree! This is not gonna work! Listen, boys, no, whoa, ah, ah! Let's take a recess, ah! - [Pico] Timber! (Christopher crashing) - Uh-oh. (pleasant music) Looks kinda dark in there. - [Pico] Go see if he's okay. - [Rat] That's what I call breaking and entering. - [Pico] Columbus, you in here? (insects buzzing) - This little piggy went to the gold! - [Bob] Oh, the honeycomb! - Oh no, help, Pico! - I gotta get up there! - Hey, that's it, Pico. We'll eat our way to the top. (Christopher groaning) - Sticky, whoa. Oh this gold! - What are we waiting for? - We gotta get that swarm. - No, Pico, help me, ah! (insects buzzing) - I'm coming, Marilyn! (Pico drilling) - [Christopher] I'm almost there! - What am I going to do? - Tadah! - Pico. (tender music) (insects buzzing) - Sorry, my nose is kind of big. (Marilyn giggles) Okay. - Boy oh boy, what a day! Enough gold to make the king and queen a complete set of dinnerware for 12, and they're gonna have me to thank for it! - Wow! - Oh, the gold! For my beauty! Now, Isabella, she's mine! (Christopher laughs) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wha! Aya! - Shh, don't, be quiet. The swarm will hurt. - Yes, you're right, Pico. - And now, Mr. Puppet, will you get the gold? Okiedokie, I'll get to the gold, yes sir. Wha, oh, woo! Hottie! (Christopher sputtering) - What's this, an intruder? - Hey, wait! - Oh no! - Stop! - Hey, Mr. Swarm, you ticklish or what? What, hey! - You dare to insult me? You, you puny human. - Oh, you sure are ugly. - Let me hear your final words. You came to steal my honey. So you will be punished like a thief. Insects of the night, show them. - What are you doing, wait! Little off the top. Whoa, all right, come on toro, come on, come on, toro. Come on, yah! - Come on Marilyn, we're outta here! - Okay. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - Oh I'm out of clothes! - Hey, come on! - You're great, Pico. - Honey. (Christopher yelling) - Let me go! - Haha, I haven't had so much fun in ages! (Christopher yelling) - Hi, Bob. This is my girlfriend, Marilyn. Bob's about to bring the house down. - Pleased to meet ya. (Christopher yelling) - Hey, hey, put me down, you big bunch of ugliness! I'll pull off your cracked little wings! You dirty rats! Whoa, whoa, hey! Watch those stingers! (earth rumbling) (insects buzzing) - I think my plan worked! (rat screams) - We gotta get outta here, ah! - You are destroying my kingdom! - Whoa, get outta here! I'll take care of this! Columbus is my friend, I gotta help! - No! - [Swarm Lord] There's no way you'll this island alive! (Christopher yelling) - The gold, gold! What a trinket! All mine! - [Swarm Lord] This is all your doing, beggars! (explosion booms) - Oh no, Pico! - [Swarm Lord] Insignificant scum, you actually challenge my might? - Oh my goodness! - Watch this one. Take that. Take a piece of this and, ah. All right. - I got it, I got it, I, I- - No! - [Swarm Lord] Say goodbye! - Hey, Pico, let's go! - Pico! (all yelling) (explosion booms) (insects squelching) (insects buzzing) - Yuck! - You squished the swarm! (Christopher yelling) - Look out! (all yelling) (tower rumbling) (water rushing) (all yelling) Look out! - White water, help! (all yelling) - Look, Marilyn! - Help! - Don't worry, Marilyn, I'm coming! - Pico! - Mortimer, hurry! She's gonna drown! (Pico groaning) Oh, I missed her. (Pico groaning) Oh, Marilyn. (somber music) (gentle music) - Ah, what happened? - We're dead. We've gone off the edge. Off the edge. - The gold! Where's the gold? Ah, there! But where's my Pico? Hello. Oh, look! (somber music) Oh. - Marilyn. Oh, Marilyn. Marilyn. (all groaning) Don't leave me. You're so beautiful. I tried to save you. I did the best I could. (Christopher gasps) - [Christopher] Pico, look, look at the sun! (dramatic music) - Pico? - Marilyn? Oh! - Oh, Pico. - Aww. (Christopher chuckles) (Bob honks nose) - Boy oh boy, gold sure is heavy, you know? Now where did we leave that ship? Uh-oh. I, uh. (Christopher chuckling) Run, boys, run! Hello, chiefy. Can we discuss this sensibly? - You've stolen our idol. Destroyed our sacred temple. - Yes, but. - And, you've made squishy with the swarm. How can we ever thank you? - Squishy? - [Chief] As for the gold. - Can I keep it, can I, can I? - It's only plated. - But of course. (pleasant music) - Well, little Pico? We not only discovered the New World, but you were right. The world, she's round! And I couldn't have done it without you. - [Pico] That's true, Columbus, but we did it together. - Just think, Pico. Because of you, and me, one day, there's gonna be a big, big city right here, and there's gonna be a lot of people, tall buildings. Maybe they gonna name something after us, who knows?
