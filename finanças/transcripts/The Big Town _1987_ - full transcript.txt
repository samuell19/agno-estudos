Just around the corner there's heartache... ... down the street that losers use. If you can wade in through the teardrops... ... you'll find me at the Home of the Blues. I will and cry while my heartbeat... ... keeps time with the drag of my shoes. The sun never shines through this window of mine... ... it's dark at the Home of the Blues. Pass me the bones, Hooker. Come on, lucky number seven. The point is still nine. Let's see that seven. Seven. - Come on. Well done, boy. - Seven. Seven, lose. Nine. Jesus, winner seven. Thirty dollars, shoot it all. I?ll take ten of that. - Five here. Come on, don't be shy. - Here's the other ten. Let's go. Coming out. Shooter coming out. Let's see you crap out, Cully. Crap out, crap out. Shooter coming out. Let's see crap out, Cully. Winner seven. You lucky bastard. Sixty dollars. Let it ride. Can he shoot sixty dollars, Hook? Shooter's limit, boys. Come on. Who's in? Twenty, no pass, Cully. Who else gonna be a man? - I got twenty here. Five here. - Fifteen my last. Coming out again. Come on, natural. Let's see those craps. Snake-eyes! Six, and he stays. - Point is six. You gonna make that six, ain't you, Cully? It's your money, Hook. Ten says he passes. Don't be shy? - Any takers? I?ll take it. Even money? Slide in another deuce there, Prager. That bet is ten to twelve. The point is six. Ten. You can shoot again. Come on, Cully. How many days in a week? Six days in a week, man. I feel a seven. - Come on, Cully. How many days in the week, Cully? - Seven, seven, Cully. Seven, seven! I told you six, man! - Six! Six, winner, six the hard way. Pay the line and collect the don'ts. A hundred and twenty dollars. Shoot it all. What do you say, boys? - Cleaned out. Cully cheats. He can't cheat with straight dice, Prager. Then how come he always wins, Hooker? Because I?m lucky. - Bullshit! Come on, now, boys. We've had our fun tonight. Cully broke the game, Prager. Well, we'll get ourselves some sleep, what do you say? Yeah. Goodnight, Hooker. See you next week? - It?s possible. Anybody got any money left? - Not a cent. Eleven. Winner, eleven. Some day your luck's gonna change, Cully. Hey, stranger. - Come on, get in, Cully. You got something, Cully. Luck, Hooker, I got luck. I don't believe in luck. I?ve been watching you these past few years. I ain't seen nobody play the odds better. Yeah, well, I tell you... ...there's a lot of guys who know the odds and... Yeah, but you got something extra. I mean, you got the ability to take yourself out of a roll,... ...like you don't even care, knowing what's meant to be will be. And that's what it takes to win big. You gotta have the cool. And you got it. You're young, Cully. There's a whole world out here and you're just seeing it... ...through a bitty crack under the door. You think I can make it in Chicago? I know it. I?m gonna think about it, Hook. Yeah, I?ll think about it. It?s McMullin on the telephone. Yeah. Yeah. You're late for work again. Dorothy. Hello, Mr. McMullin. What's new with you? Well, there's one thing I want you to talk to about. That son of yours up and quit on me. Have a nice day now. You promised me, Carl Hooker. Now I didn't promise exactly. I said I?d do everything I could. You swore to me over Jimmy's grave that... ...you wouldn't teach my boy to drink and gamble like his father. You lied. Now, first of all, I never swore,... ...and it sure as hell wasn't over Jimmy's grave. And secondly, your husband wasn't much of a gambler. He was a drunk, that's true,... ...and you had a whole to do with that. And whatever it was I said, was before I saw Cully's talent. He's one of the best damn dice players I ever saw in my life. I want my boy back. I want you to tell him... - Dorothy... ...you ain't never gonna get your boy back. I walk 47 miles of barbed wire. I use a cobra snake for a necktie. I had a house on the roadside made from rattlesnake hide. I got a brand new chimney made on top... ... made out of a human skull. Now, come on take a little walk with me Arlene honey... ... and tell me who do you love. Mr. McMullin says you can have your job back. No questions asked, if you call him back by tonight. Ma, I know what you're thinking. You think... ...you think I?m going to turn out just like dad. Well, I ain't. I never worried about that. But I ain't gonna turn out like you either. Now, you call collect if you get in trouble. I?m not going to get in any trouble, Mom. Did you get all dressed up to set me off? Hell, no. I had to go see the doctor over in Evansville. I figured, if you dress sharp,... ...they're less likely to find anything the matter with you. You're crazy, Hook. There you go. Name: Ferguson Edwards. Now, they're expecting you. And I told 'em you're the best damn dice arm they're ever gonna see. What'd you tell 'em that for? Well, they know I exaggerate. This here's my lucky dollar. It?s for you. I had this in my pocket the night I won the Packard. I thought you didn't believe in luck. - I don't. I believe in confidence. The illusion of luck. Now, don't you ever gamble with that unless you absolutely gotta win. I don't mean want to, I mean have to. Yeah, don't you be a stranger now. Get in there and just tear 'em up. I will. Take care, Hook. - All right. Thanks for everything. Big town, big town... ... you give a nice Saturday night. Anything, anywhere, anytime... ... that's what I like. I hear the sax screaming... ... the bands are swinging, oh big town. Standing on the corner lately... ... watch the chicks go by. Big town woman... ... got it in her eye. Got me fun real fast,... ... you make it so nice, oh big town. Left my baby,... ... yes I let her down. Love you, baby. Excuse me. I?m looking for a Mr. Ferguson. There's a man here looking for a Mr. Ferguson. Just a minute. It'll be a minute. Grab a seat. Thanks. J.C. Cullen? So, you're J.C. Cullen. They call me Cully, ma'am. My name is Ferguson Edwards. Hooker didn't tell me you were a woman. No, he wouldn't have. Hooker tells me you're about the best dice arm I?m never gonna see. Are you? - Well, I shoot pretty good. You know all the odds on the pass line, the points... ...the side bets, that sort of things - Like I know my name. How many come-out rolls does it take... ...to work out all the odds in whole numbers? Nineteen hundred and eighty. Of those the shooter will pass with a natural 440 times,... ...throw craps on the come-out 220 times,... ...make his point 536 times,... What's the most you've ever won in one night? 157 and change. 157 and change. It?s gonna be a pretty so-so night for you here in Chicago. Think you can make it in the big-time? Yes, ma'am. That's what I?m here for. Mister Edwards? Well, if Hooker says he's okay... ...then he must be. Cully, this is mister Edwards, my husband. You'll be working for us now. - Yes, ma'am. Put all your money down on my desk. Okay. I?ll just keep it for you... ...so you can have bus fare back to Rockport. All right, give me your dice. Now you're clean. It?s the first thing you learn about shooting for us. You gamble with our money. You carry our dice. We know our dice are straight. - Yes, ma'am. We get 70% of everything you win. We'll send Hooker ten percent. Hooker didn't say anything about any 10%. That's the deal. Take it or leave it. Take it. Good. There's a hotel that we own down the street. We'll put you up there. Come back tomorrow about 3 p. m. and we'll get you started. Just a little something to tide you over. Thanks. Save the thanks, son. Wait'll you see what it comes of it. Excuse me. Let me have a pack of Juicy Fruit. That'll be five cents. You might have told me Ferguson was a woman. You didn't ask me. Besides I don't owe you anything. Yes, you do. You owe me nineteen dollars and ninety-five cents. You must be Cullen. - Must be. I?m Harold, the night manager. Mrs. Edwards said to give you a room in the third floor,... ...so you can get some sleep in the daytime. So, maybe you could show me how to shoot dice sometime,... ...could you, Mr. Cullen? - Yeah, sure, Harold. Why don't you call me Cully? I don't go so much for that mister business. Okay then, Cully. You know where I can get a bite to eat around here? Well, I usually eat a place called 'Mother's'... ...right down the block. What's wrong? - Nothing. It?s just a fellow once warned me never to gamble in a place... ...called Honest John's and never eat in a place called Mother's. Well, you can suit yourself, but I?ve been eating there nine years. You can see it ain't hurt me none. - No, I guess not. By the way, there's a little game... ...going on down in the basement, if you're interested. What's the minimum bet? - A buck. I?ll go two for the shooter. I picked up sixty dollars in a little crap game at the hotel last night. I already know that. Yeah, well I figured. From now on you shoot only with our money. You got it? Yes, ma'am. I?m sending you out with one of my best arms tonight,... ...Sonny Binkley. He's gonna break you in. I?m not gonna give you the usual routine, because Hooker sent you up. But it Sonny tells me you can't handle the dice... ...or my money, you're gone. You understand that? Sure. - Here's two hundred dollars. Sonny's gonna take you on the Grand Tour. The places where they have the regular games,... ...where you'll be shooting 80% of the time. Good luck. Cullen? - Yes, ma'am? How is Hooker these days? He's fine. He's doing just fine. Get married yet? No, Hooker. He's still chasin' them though. I guess you know how he is. Who's here? Cullen, the new man. I?m just sending him out with Sonny. Mr. Edwards. The odds are with you to make money,... ...as long as you know the dice and the bets. Now in a head's up game, the bets is negotiated. It?s mostly even money. It?s not like betting against a casino. Lots of times the guys bettin' against you don't even know the true odds. I mean, say some sucker lays down a side bet when the point is five. You cover it quick with even money. That's right. Odds is three to two for you,... ...and you only gotta give him even money. A guy like that ain't gonna stay in the game too long. Too bad. All it takes is a couple guys like that betting on instinct... ...and you can start taking their money real regular. Otherwise, the Edwardses wouldn't stay in business. Listen, man, free advice is usually worth exactly what it cost,... ...but you-all comin' in here pretty much like I did,... ...I thought I?d tell you something that's good to remember. This here town is one real place to get... ...hooked on something. It?s right over there. They get dope here, man, like you never heard of,... ...and women, man, like you never seen. And booze... ...but like I said, I thought I?d just at least warn you. I appreciate it. What we got here tonight is a big sales convention. I love salesmen. I heard there was a game in here. - Come on in. Hey, Duke. - Sonny. How you doing? - Good. J.C., J.C., this is Duke. How you doing? - Hey, Duke. Come on, let's move the side bets. How you doing? - Hey, how are you? New money in the game? - Yes. New shooter coming out. Get outta that bed,... ... wash your face and hands. Get outta that bed,... ... wash your face and hands. Well, you get in that kitchen,... ... make some noise with the pots and pans. I said, shake, rattle and roll,... ... shake, rattle and roll. Well, you won't do right to save you doggone soul. I believe to my soul you're a devil in nylon hose. I believe to my soul you're a devil in nylon hose. Well, the harder I work, the faster my money goes. I said, shake, rattle and roll,... ... shake, rattle and roll. Well, you won't do right to save your doggone soul. Shake, rattle and roll. Now Cullen, you made 396 dollars in five nights. Not bad for a young man, especially since it's tax free. Yeah, well you didn't do too badly yourself. I figure you made... ...1.386 dollars off of me and my shooting. Listen to him. The man's been here one week; already the greed is showing through. Hey, that's not what I meant. What did you mean, Cullen? Nothing. I just kinda said it, that's all. Didn't mean for it to sound that way. I hope you're smart enough to figure out Mr. Edwards risked... ...nineteen hundred and eighty dollar to win the thirteen hundred. I hope you also realize... ...that if you were not working for mister Edwards... ...you'd be suspected of being a hustler and a cheat... ...every time you left the game a winner. I?m sorry if I sounded out of line. Arm, if you really got no use for that fat roll... ...there in your hand, why don't you take it on down to the Gem... ...and let some real crapshooters take it away from you? What's the Gem? It?s the only game in town where you can't shoot with your own money. It?s a Sunday night game backstage at the Gem Club... ...across the street. - Yeah? Well, maybe I will go down there. And maybe I?ll break the game,... ...just like I broke those other ones this week. Yeah, maybe you will. Maybe you won't. Why don't you go on and give it a try, Hooker's boy? You want anything else? She don't want you, Cullen. Now, maybe if you was Hooker himself... ...instead of Hooker's boy. Well, I called my baby and told her to be... ... down at the juke joint a- waitin' for me. 'Cause I?m a juke joint Johnny... ... I know every joint in town. I?m a juke joint Johnny... ... and I?m always joking' around. Now, I work all weekend and I draw my pay... You wanna hear something? Yeah, sure. How about this Bob Dicklley record? Doesn't get much air time. Yeah, well, the good stuff they don't play on the radio. You work here? No, I sort of live here. Yeah? Nice place you got here. I live down off State Street. I?m over on Wabash. Yeah? - Yeah. We're neighbors then. I can't decide, Sid. I mean, I want all three, but I?ve only got a dollar. You decide. No, I can't let you do that. - Are you sure? Yeah, thanks anyway. - Okay. We've got eight thousand of the Elvis records. You can probably get in next week. All right. Thanks. Nine dollars. Let me get the lady's record. Hi. - Hello. I almost missed it. I?m Aggie. Aggie Donaldson. Hi, Aggie. Jack Cullen. - Hi. Where you from, Jack? Around and about. What, like downstate someplace? How come you know so much? 'Cause I?m from downstate myself. - Yeah? Chicago's a great place for music. It?s got jazz, country, rock 'n roll. Anything you like. What do you like? I like anything that really cooks. - Yeah? Yeah. I wanna get my own collection of classics,... ...'cause one of these days I wanna get a job as a D.J. A what? A D.J. You know a disc jockey. Radio announcer. Do they have women disc jockeys? Well, they will. There's a training school right here in Chicago,... ...and they said they'd take me if I pass the FCC test. And the FCC said anyone can take it. Hi, mommy. - Hi. Did you have a good nap? Thanks for looking in on her. Well, she was no problem at all. I brought you a surprise. - What? Your favorite cookies. Why don't you take 'em up to the kitchen, and eat 'em at the counter? Here we go. So... - So, what's your husband do? It?s a kind of a long story. Now and then I tell people he was killed in Korea... ...when I?m in the mod for a little sympathy. I never actually married him. We were just a couple of kids. I don't know. It never would have worked. Yeah. - Yeah. It?s too bad. Well, you know where I live. It was nice running into you. - Yeah. Hey, Aggie. Could you hold onto these for me? I don't have a record player yet. Sure, Jack. Take care. - You too. Hey, how you doing? What you doin' here? I was looking for you. - How's that? Is that your girl? - Yeah. No shit. I?ve grown so used to you somehow... ... but I?m nobody's sugar daddy now... ... and I?m lonesome,... ... I got the lovesick blues. Thank you. Thank you very much. Honey! Hey, honey! Honey! Ginger! Honey! Honey, here. This here's J.C. Cullen. Cully, this is Ginger, my true love. Hello, J.C. - Hi, Ginger. Adele, you know what I?m after. Do you want anything? - Nothing. You know I don't approve of you drinking on the job. You don't approve of me drinking anytime. Ain't my Sonny-boy here the biggest old fuddy-duddy... ...you ever saw? You will, darling. - Yeah, he sure is. Say, Sonny, you ever shoot dice in the progame over at the Gem Club? Sometimes. But it ain't easy to beat. - Why? Because you gotta take and give true odds on side bets. No way to get the odds to work for you. That's a tight game, brother. One of those pros on a hot streak is just liable to whip out a couple.. ...of hundred and just shoot it all. Me, I don't like to gamble. Shoo, ain't that a scream. Sonny don't like to gamble. Honey, you know what I mean. I know what you mean, but I... ...I?ll tell you, I feel like going over there tonight. You feel like it? - All right. Just for a few minutes. There goes this week's pay. You think you can get all Jim Bean laid in his grave without me? I reckon so. You think that you can keep your eyes off them girls at the Gem? You keep him on the straight and narrow, J.C. If he can't keep his eyes off of 'em,... ...you make sure he keeps his hands off of them. Okay? - I?ll try. It was nice to meet you, J.C. Nice meeting you. - You come around again. You be good. There's only one thing about the Gem Club though. It?s a kind of a strange place to shoot dice. Baby, do it again. She ain't real, boy. She ain't real. Hey, hey, let me have some of that. Hi. - Hey, Sonny-boy. Hi. - Hi. How you doin', Sonny? This here is J.C. He's a friend of mine. He works for Ferguson. - Come on in. Roll 'em, Deacon. Lord, grant me a seven... ...to relieve those sinful gamblers of their money. Winner seven. Thank you, Lord, thank you. Who's the nut case? The name's Deacon Daniels. Don't let any of that fool you. He's a first class arm. Shoot it all. - The shooters falls now. A Little Joe from Kokomo. Gentlemen, the point is four. Forty says the Deacon don't. Twenty says he does. You're short. I put down forty. It?s a two to one bet. You looking for even money? Let it lay. I guess you know the game. I guess. Is that Ferguson's new flash? I speak English. Well, I?m glad you could make it, Flash. It is fifty dollars to roll the dice. I make all the 'don'ts' at my discretion. And other than that it's head's up game. Okay. Roll 'em. You got it! Four! What, you gonna bet 60 whole dollars, Murphy? Are you sure about that? That's more money than you ever made in a month, isn't it? You got that right. Sorry, Murphy. It?s gotta be tough going through life with no balls. Do they let you in the men's room, Murphy? Sunflower's point. There's one guy Will Rogers never met. Well, we are the way God made us. And the way we make ourselves. Amen, brother. James Daniels. And don't call me Jimmy, call me Deacon. J.C. Cullen. You just call me Cully. Who's he? His name is George Cole. He used to be some kind of gangster, or criminal, or something like that. Yeah? Or maybe he has just in the Marines. I never have got it straight. This is his place, as you might have guessed. He ain't been saved yet. How about you? One C. One C. You pay that to the man from Kentucky. I see you have yet to conquer the temptations of the flesh. Viva! - Hi. Excuse me,... ...another young sinner in the need of the comfort of the word. Viva five. The winner five. Six. Spinning around on all sides there. The number is six. Hi. - Hi. All right. No problem. E- oh-leven. You're new here, aren't you? Yes, ma'am. The name's J.C. Cullen. Well, hi, J.C. Hey, seven out. How'd you do? - I?ve done better. You need change for a dollar, Flash? Five C's to pass. Well, a high roller has arrived. You're faded, sir. Fifty with the shooter. Put it down on the table, Murphy. There's no fly bets here. New shooter coming out. Show 'em how many days in the week. Hundred dollars on my man. How many days in the week? Winner seven for Flash. Throws a natural. One thousand, shoot it all. One thousand faded. Shooter coming out again. Winner eleven. Two thousand dollars. Two thousand faded. Ten, the point is ten. One C on the shooter. Any more side action here? One hundred, looking for two hundred. Four thousand, shoot it all. You better drag your winning while you still got 'em, farm boy. Four thousand faded. Number eleven. Seven thousand, shoot it all. What do you got? - Four thousand. Seven faded. Come on J.C. Make the pass, pass. Eight. The point is eight. Eight's the point. Eight. Come, J.C. Let's see it again. Eight, eight. Shooter falls now. - Come on. E- o-leven. One roll too late. Come on, what you see is what you get. Winner eight. Fourteen thousand. Fourteen thousand? Shoot it all. J.C.'s broke the game. Come on, get your money. Let's get out of here. Come on, Cully. That's fourteen grand. Jim Dandy to the rescue,... ... Jim Dandy to the rescue. Jim Dandy to the rescue,... ... go Jim Dandy, go Jim Dandy. Jim Dandy on the mountain top... ... ten thousand feet to drop. He started giddy on a runaway horse... ... ha ha that's right of course. Jim Dandy to the rescue,... ... go Jim Dandy, go Jim Dandy. Jim Dandy had a girl named Sue... ... she was feelin' kind of blue. Jim Dandy is the kinda guy... ... he never like to see a woman cry. Jim Dandy to the rescue,... ... go Jim Dandy, go Jim Dandy. Jim Dandy to the rescue,... ... Jim Dandy to the rescue. Jim Dandy to the rescue,... ... go Jim Dandy, go. Stop staring at me. You're staring at me, Cullen. I guess I was. I?m sorry. People like to stare at the blind. Makes them think they have an advantage. They think we don't know. But we do know. And I don't like to be stared at. I understand last night you... ...took the Gem game and just broke it. Took 'em for about fifteen grand, I understand. Yeah. I like to see a young man get ahead. Yeah, I remember the time I broke my first big game. Never was a feeling play like that again. I was good, Cullen. God, I was good. Hooker and me... ...we were the best damn dice arms in the whole Midwest. There wasn't a game from Minneapolis to Memphis... ...we couldn't just clean out playing partners. We were something. Let me tell you about the time I lost my eyes. There was this kid, nice,... ...clean-cut young kid from Iowa. When he first came up, he got on a roll... ...like we'd never seen before or since. He just set this town on fire. He got to actually thinking he could will the dice. Like he had some kind of telepathy or something. Hooker and I, we weren't that impressed with this punk. So, we decided to watch him. Didn't really understand the odds, I said. So, we waited him out. He lost his last ten bucks to me. He turned around and asked me would I fade him on credit. Is he kidding me or what? I mean, you know, you never lend money to a man in a crap game. I just looked him straight in the eye, and I said,... ...no, the odds have finally caught up with you. Adios, punk. Well, he went crazy. He got all upset. He started running around like a wild man. He ran over... ...over here, on this east wall and there was... ...a pan of battery acid. And he ran towards it and threw it on us. And a few of us, jus a few, got hit. Hooker gotta little bit on his shirt. And I was his back man... ...and I took it all right... ...right here in my eyes. What happened to the kid? Nothing happened to the kid. The kid got away. The kid ran down an alley. We never saw him again. Pete Carbondale. Yeah, that was his name... ...had a small read heart... ...tattooed on the inside of his right wrist,... ...right here. Eight years... ...I had guys looking for him. We never found him. That's too bad. Yeah, too bad. He was a punk,... ...just like you. And you know something, Cullen. Some day your luck's going to change, just like his. You remember I told you that. Hey, I?m sorry about your bad luck, Mr. Edwards,... ...but I?m not a punk. And I wouldn't throw battery acid in any man's face. I?ll be outside, till Ferguson gets back. Well, what did you say the odds were? All right, then put five dollars on the Packers. Right. All right. Bye. Hey. - What do you say, Buddy? Say, how many suits you buy, Flash? Four. I figure I?d better spend some of that money... ...before them 'arms' at the Gem Club get a chance to get it back. You got that right, brother. Okay, let me guess. Who could this be? June Carter? Nope. Must be Ginger McDonald. Your perfume gave you away. Ain't nobody gonna give me away but my daddy. Speaking of which, me and Ginger, we got a little deal worked out. She's gonna be Mrs. Sonny Binkley. No kidding? When? Just as soon as I can get my daddy trained to where can stay... ...in the same room with Sonny and not get into an argument. Hey, Elmo. Hold on one. Elmo! Double Jim Beam and quick. I?ll be Johnny Walker Red, straight up. On the house. I tell you. Sonny he's one lucky guy getting a girl like you. Sonny tells me that you are some bigshot with all these crap... ...shooters around. - Well, I wouldn't go that far. I?m pretty good, though. Aggie! - Ellie, how you been? Great. I?m going to be finished in half an hour. Can you wait? Yeah, all right. Hey, Aggie. Hi. What are you doing here? Just hanging around telling lies. Hi, Ginger. How you been? Just great, Aggie. Sonny and me is getting married. Yeah? That's wonderful. So, when are you gonna come over and get your records? Well, I haven't had time to go out and get a phonograph yet. You can come listen on mine if you want. I?m warning you, Aggie. This boy ain't shy. Hey, Sonny. I?d like you to meet a friend of mine. This is Aggie. Aggie, this is Sonny. How you been, Sonny? Fine. I think we best be getting on. Later. I?ll meet you out front. So, when are you home, Aggie? This week? I don't know. I gotta get a new job. I?ll just try to catch you. You know. All right. Take care. - You, too. I?ll see you. What are you doing hanging around with her? What's the matter with her? - Nothing. Don't you wonder why she's so friendly? I don't know. She's just lonely. I guess. Yeah, well, she's got at least one married man to keep her company. You can go better. I tell you true. Going to the Gem Club. Seven out, Duke. Thank you very much. What's it gonna be this time, farm boy? Two dollars or three? I?ll make it easy on you. One hundred dollars. What happened to all that money you took out here last Sunday? I?m wearing it. Pretty good tailor, kid. High roller from Indiana. Your are faded, sir. Fifty dollars on the shooter. Lord, stay the winning roll from this misguided boy's hand... ...so that you might deprive him of his sinful-gotten gains... ...and restore him to humility before thee. Hallelujah. Winner seven. Praise the Lord. Four hundred dollars. Flash is feeling fortunate. 400 dollars. Fifty says the don't. - Fifty says he do. Lord, forsake not your disciple in his hour of need. Thanks, Deacon. Eight hundred dollars. - Eight hundred dollars. Two out of there, keep it alive. The shooter falls now. Seven. Flash throws another natural. Sixteen hundred dollars. Press it. Don't you do that again! Don't you ever do that again. - What's wrong? I didn't do nothing. Jesus, Murphy! Murphy, take your money business out of here. Shame on you, Murphy. What? I didn't do anything. Two hundred on the Flash. Two hundred with the kid. Winner! Thirty-two hundred dollars, let it ride. Two hundred dollars with J.C. What's the matter, Flash? You put funny dice in my game, farm boy. I?m gonna cut your eyes out Eleven. E-o-leven. Eleven. Boys, I thing we just found the source of Flash's good fortune. Hey, wait a minute. I?m no bust-out guy. Wait a minute. Somebody set me up. If I cheated why would I announce it? Wait a minute, Cole. The boy is saying true. The boy is a slick little thief. All right. All right. Let the money lie. Let everybody take back what they bet. Get him out of here. Fucker. Every honest guy in town is going to stay clear of this game. It brings a tear... ... into my eyes,... ... when I begin... ... to realize... ... I?ve cried so much... ... since you've been gone,... Hi. I was just leaving you a note. Are you all right? - Yeah. I?m okay. You wanna come in? - Well, yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I?ll be just a minute. Come on in. I just wanted to make sure that you knew I had nothing... ...to do with what happened last night. I hadn't even thought about that. I?m very sorry. I have never seen my husband do that to anyone before. Your husband? Cole? You didn't know? No, I didn't. Listen, I have a few hours free before the next show. You wanna grab a bite? Yeah, sure. Sure. Good. Put on a shirt. I don't feel comfortable. I don't know. I never eaten in a place like this. Why don't you just act like you do with a pair of dice in your hand,... ...like you're the best there is. That's what some of the other 'arms' are saying about you, you know? Yeah? What about your husband? Does he think I?m the best? No. He just calls you that 'hay seed' bastard. Of course, he's slightly prejudice now, isn't he? Tell me, why are you so glad I broke his game? Do I have to have a reason? I just want to know why, that's all. Maybe it's a secret. All us city girls have deep dark secrets. Quit playing with me. Let's go. - I want to know why. Let's go. - I want to know why. I?ll tell you why. Because I hate the sonofabitch, all right? I hope you're satisfied. So you were just using me? Is that it? Why, do you think I made a fool out of you or something? If I?m a fool, so is everybody else. My, my, my, aren't we the wise old philosopher. Look, why don't we just forget it. Okay? Why don't we just forget the whole thing. All right? Shit. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Lorry Dane. Shake 'em up, honey, shake 'em. In my face, in my face! Hey, farm boy,... ...you know, seeing as how my trifecta came in,... ...I?m gonna pour you a drink, just this once. Now, what is it you like to drink? It?s warm milk, isn't it? Cut the shit, Madigan. Give me a whiskey straight up. What's the matter? Never see you drink anything but soda pop. Choking on all that money? How about some whiskey? - Yeah, how about it. You better give me another one. Hi. - Hey. How's the big gambler? Well, I could be better. How about yourself? It wasn't such a great day. I had to go to a funeral this afternoon. Hey, sorry. - Yeah. Well. Someone you were close to? Just a friend. Pretty unexpected, though. Why don't we be miserable together? All right. Got your key? I gotta get up early. Why bother going to sleep at all? Right. Your just close your eyes and poof, another day gone forever. Yep. What are you doing up? Will you kiss me goodnight? Yeah, I?ll be in in a minute, sweetheart. Okay? Yeah. Thank you for the fun time, Mr. Jack Cullen. What's the matter? Nothing. I don't know. I?m just feeling so bad. You came along and made me have fun. Don't go. Mama? Mama? Just give me a second, sweetheart. Listen, partner, Ferguson tells me you tied one pretty good last night. And you showed up at a game,... ...dropped four hundred. What're you doing? Been thinking about things, that's all. Come on, let's get some chow. I?m starved, man. Hey, I?ll take all that money off you hands... ...if it's causing you that much grief. What do you know about Lorry Dane? What do you want to know? A chicken noodle, please. It?s pretty damn strange with her and her husband. I mean, she hates that guy. Well, the story I heard is that Cole come across Lorry... ...stripping down in New Orleans. Now, he's a big time gambler with a 40 G wad,... ...so Lorry figures she's found the man of her dreams. A meat loaf, please, with some gravy. You bet. - Pastrami on rye. So, she persuades him to take her on up to Chicago... ...and go partners whit him in the Gem Club. So they're partners. - Could you put some gravy on that? Yeah, well the thing is, Cole is smarter than that. There you go. - He decides he wants to marry her. Now she thinks she's getting half interest that way, but she ain't. He owns the place before they was ever married. So, she goes to him and she says, 'Hey, I?d lie my share'. He just beats the crap out of her. He just lied and cheated her then? Lied? He turned that woman into his slave. Shit. I wouldn't blame her for killing the guy. Of course, I wouldn't blame anybody for killing Cole. I got it. That's four fifty. Who'd you hear about this from? Some guy that rolled into town. Rolled around with her some. You're not stuck on her, are you? No. Good. 'Cause she's nothing but a whore. Keep the change. Damn! Nigger heaven. I don't like handling nigger money. What are you talking about? It spends just like any other money. Yeah, well, you go on, get your nigger money. I like to keep my hands clean. - Hey, Sonny, where you going? Charlie, give me a beer, will you? Say, what's the action like over there? Not bad. Twenty to fifty bucks mostly. Yeah? - You from around here? No, Indiana. How about yourself? - Southern California. You an 'arm'? I?ve done some shooting. Phil Carpenter. J.C. Cullen. - Good to meet you, J.C. You here for the fight? - Yeah, you bet I am. I own a piece of one of those fighters there. Besides, there's no place like Chicago for head's-up craps, I?ll tell you. Yeah. I?m gonna go get my feet wet. Hey, well, good luck. Get one of 'em wet for me. Take care. New shooter coming out. Shooter coming out. - Forty with the shooter. Forty faded. How you all doing? - Good. Eleven. Winner. Well, if it isn't my favorite farm boy. How's it going, son? See forty with the shooter. Faded. You know what they say, country boy, no harm; no foul. Put your money where your mouth is, man. Come on. I hope you're taking good care of my money. Yeah, well if you hadn't stolen that 1.600 from me,... ...you might've had a chance to win all your money back. Smart little stunt you pulled. You're a real dandy, Flash. You know that? Yeah, how come no one will play at your game any more? I have a full house every Sunday night. Yeah? Playing with yourself is what I heard. Don't push your luck, country boy. What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. George could come in at any minute. George just got in a game on the South Side. Well, what do you want? I just wanted to tell you I?m sorry, I didn't know. Didn't know what? - About you and George. What about me and George? Well, about how he lied to you, cheated you. Let's face it, Lorry, he's just using you like you were a slave. You think you know all about me, don't you? Well, you don't know anything about me. So, don't think you can pass judgment on me, because you can't. You're the one that wants to use me. Well, I wanna hear you say it. Say it! - I love you. Never know how much I love you,... ... never know how much I care. When you put your arms around me... ... I get a fever that's so hard to bear. You give me fever,... ... when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight. Fever in the morning,... ... fever all through the night. Bless my soul I love you... ... take this heart away,... ... take these arms I?ll never use,... ... and just believe in what my lips have to say. You give me fever,... ... when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight. Fever in the morning,... ... fever all through the night. Hello. Mom. What's up? When? All right. I?ll be there. Well, I?ve been asked to say a few words today as we... ...lay Carl Hooker into his final resting place. I did not know the man personally. But all who knew him say he was a personably, friendly... ...man who had a kind word for everyone. Carl Hooker does not leave behind him sons or daughters,... ...nor does he leave vast worldly possessions. He was a man who touched the lives of many in warm fellowship. He was a man who made many friends. This is his legacy. Hooker knew he was dying, didn't he? He called me last week and asked me to see to things. The gas station is broke. There's not much left, but... ...he did want you to have his car. He sure had a lot of pals. Where were his 'pals' today? Are you kidding? Everybody liked Hooker. Sure, sure, Everybody liked him. I nearly got crushed in the crowd at the funeral. Everybody liked him but nobody loved him. It?s a sad thing when a man goes through life... ...and never knows what love is. Yeah? They have a very good telephone service in this city. You should try it sometime. I had to go to a funeral. - Yeah, whose? What happened? - A stroke. He had two before and he never told anybody. You don't want it? - No. I don't want it around. - Why? I said I didn't want it. So that's it. You just wipe him out of your memory like he never was? The past is the past. Well, if that's the case,... ...I want the ten percent you were giving Hooker. We'll split. Seventy-five, twenty-five. I want Hooker's percentage and I want all of it. Apparently you don't realize that your credibility... ...around Chicago has dropped to almost nothing. Some of the 'arms' at the Gem Club think that you cheated... ...the night you broke the table at.. - That's a pack of lies. Do you think I?m stupid enough to slip a pair of loaded dice... ...into a professional game? I don't know what you're stupid enough to do. I?ve heard you've taken an interest in Mrs. Cole. Who told you that? - George Cole is a rattlesnake. If you're smart you'll stay away from him an his wife. I?m telling you that as a friend, as somebody who is looking out for you. Well, maybe I don't need anybody looking out for me. Maybe I don't need a shooter who... ...comes in drunk and drops four hundred dollars! It won't happen again. The split is seventy-five, twenty-five. Okay. I don't have to tell you... ...you're one of the best 'arms' I have. But you better keep your mind on the game. Yes, ma'am. Nine, a winner! Shoot the two. A hundred with the shooter. Hey, how's it going? - Good, good, going good. You sure ran out of here the other night. Yeah, well I had some business that couldn't wait. A woman? Listen, hell, that ain't business, that's a catastrophe, brother. Tell you what shoot me winner. I?ll buy you a steak. So anyway, that's about the long and short of it. This girl s got a hold of me where I don't wanna be gotten a hold of. I can't stop thinking about her. You want advice? Sure, if you've got any. Forget her. The world's full of ladies that lay down... ...for a gambler on a roll. Just don't get involved. Stay cool. Is that what you do? Stay cool? Yeah. That's the only way I lasted this long. Cigarette? So, what's it like out on the West Coast? You know? Well, I?ll tell you, kid. The West Coast circuit is a little different than back here. You know, most of your shooters, they like to play the pony. They bet on the fighters, football games, dog tracks, that sort of thing They don't like to follow a circuit where the shooter may quit winners... ...and then go blow it all on the track, you know? I guess when you're raised in a garage and washroom games,... ...you get a little narrow-minded. Yeah, sure, sure. It?s not the only thing that makes a guy narrow-minded. No, you got that right. Hey, Sonny, I need to talk to you, when you got a minute. Can't you see we're busy. Well, this is kind of important. Yeah, well maybe I don't feel like talking. What's wrong with you? Well, maybe we don't like any nigger-lovers hanging around. Hey, Sonny, maybe if you weren't such a narrow-minded bastard... Now why don't you just go find your little whore and leave me alone? Who is it? It?s me. Cully. No! Run and let him in, and tell him I?ll be out in a minute, okay? Act like a lady. Hey. My mommy says she'll be back in a minute. Okay. I got a minute. Hey, do you know who this is? Who? - Elvis Presley. Yeah? Well, he's yours now. Jack! What a surprise. Yeah. I thought I?d come by and see how you're doing. Well, I?m doing just fine. I got a letter saying I passed the FCC test. That's great. - I know. Yeah, so you're gonna be on the radio. Well, I still have to make enough money to pay for the training school. But the man who runs it said about... ...just about every guy who graduates is getting a job. Course, I?m not a guy. So, let's go out and celebrate. I got so much to do tomorrow. Well, we'll just go out for a couple of hours. I don't want to stay out long. There is a really hot sax player in town. Let's go to see him. Yeah. Thank you, thank you. We'll be right back. Your luck will change just like mine did. Yeah, well I don't believe in luck. Well, I do. It was luck when I run into you at the Biloxi that night. The man I was in love with was buried that day. God, that was the worst day of my life. The daughter called me up and asked me... ...not to embarrass them by showing up at the funeral. So did you go? Yeah, of course I went. I mean, he would've expected me to. Probably wouldn't have wanted me to, but he would've expected me to. I like that. Yeah, you were real sweet to me. Yeah. Listen Aggie, I wanted to talk to you about that. I wanted to clear up a few things. Well, what's bothering you? Well, besides the... ...fact that I haven't any real friends in this town. Well, you got one I know of. I feel real down. I?m hooked on this girl... ...and I?m trying real hard to forget about her. Yeah, sometimes that's the hardest thing in the world, isn't it? It is. If you need my help, you'll let me know. Look who's here, the Indiana Flash. I hope you're enjoying the show. You got some real talent here. We've decided to let you back in my Sunday game, Flash. If you promise not to cheat again. What's the matter, Cole? Does it burn you that the best arm in Chicago won't shoot at your game? The best arm in Chicago has never missed my game, Flash. Never missed. If you see anything you want back there, let me know. So, the girls are for sale? Some. How much for Lorry Dane? Now, she's expensive. That little bitch'll cost you a lot more than money. Nice seeing you. Cully. - Hey. Cully, he knows about us. I know he does. So, what's gonna do? He's going to win back the money that he lost to you and then... And then what? - I don't know what. I?m really sorry I got you into all this. I?m never gonna let you go of you. Baby, I wanna Singapore Sling. You buy one for me? If you're good. - Please. I?ve been good. I am good, aren't I? No. - No? You're great. Hi, Aggie. Your waitress will be right with you. You had her, didn't you? Come on. You did, didn't you? What's wrong? You seem so far away. I?m thinking. About us? No. Well, then stop thinking about it. You can only think about me. I think I found the guy who blinded Mr. Edwards. His name's Phil Carpenter,... ...and he's been shooting at the Belleville game. What's that got to do with us? So, I just feel like it's not fair. If you play the game long enough,... ...you start to realize that it's not just luck. If you don't know the true odds, or you forget them,... ...you pay for it, always. A player gets what he deserves. So, maybe Mr. Edwards deserved to be blinded. I don't know. But the guy who did that... ...it's not fair that... ...he can just ruin a man's life and get off scot free. Stay out of it, Cully. Nothing good can come from it. Besides, Mr. Edwards isn't the only man unlucky in life. You lost your dad when you were ten. Is that fair? It?s not the same thing. My daddy loved me too much. What do you mean? Well, let's just say he put me through a really bad scene... ...when I was very young. Come here. I?m crazy about you. Let's just get away from here. Cully, George would find us; he'd kill us. He hates me and he's burning to beat you. He doesn't have much money left. The first time you broke the game he lost almost fifteen thousand dollars. My God, you were one roll away from owning the Gem Club. I?m glad you could both make it. Mrs. Cole. Your reputation precedes you here, Mr. Cullen. Lorry tells me you found a way to help her... ...get her fair share of the Gem Club. I?ve advised Mrs. Cole that in the event of divorce proceedings,... ...the Club would go to Mr. Cole. It?s all in his name. However, since I have represented Mr. Cole... ...in several criminal proceedings,.. ...I enjoy his confidence. Last week he offered the Gem Club... ...as collateral for loan of about twenty thousand dollars. Is the Gem Club worth twenty thousand dollars? God, yes. It?s worth several times that. Provided, of course, if we can find a buyer. And that's where you come in. I would like you to loan me half the money to loan Cole. And then play him. I?d be betting against my own money. Cully, I?ll pay you back. I swear I will. So, it all depends on me? Loaning you half the money,... ...and then beating Cole in a dice game? Exactly. Let's do it. - Yeah? Who is it? - It?s me, Jack. I want to talk to you. - No. Come on, Aggie, open up. Come on. I really need to talk to you. What do you want to talk about? Look, I won't stay long. Christy, will you let us have some 'alone' time? Thank you, sweetheart. Look, I want to send this to my mother... ...if you don't hear from me by Tuesday. Why you? What's wrong? Look, just do it for me. Okay? Yeah, right. Here this is for you. You don't owe me anything. I mean, if you feel guilty o something,... ...just forget about it, okay? Look, I wish there was something I could do,... ...or something I could tell you. I could tell you I?m not going to see her anymore. I don't wanna lie to you. Why, are you in love with her? I don't know. She makes me crazy. I can't get her out of my mind. Look, I feel sorry for her. I want to help her. Yeah, then what? Eighter from Decatur, the masturbator Fifty looking for sixty. Seven out. Well, look who's here. The Flash is back. Who's your friend, Flash? This here is Patsy Fuqua. Patsy. Gentlemen, my name is Patsy Fuqua. As he said,... ...I am president of the Fuqua Novelty Company of Gary, Indiana. And we supply most of the casinos in Nevada. We guarantee our dice for unconditionally true play. If anyone can prove that our dice do not yield... ...absolutely random results, we will pay him one thousand dollars... ...for each percentage by which the results deviate from random. I have here brand new dice, still factory-sealed. I shoot with Patsy's dice or I don't shoot. Whatever you say, Flash. This is a casual game here. We all trust each other. Deacon. I feel the spirit of the Lord in these two dice. I guarantee you that the spirit of the Lord... ...was not present in those dice when they left the factory. Shoot one G. - Faded. Winner seven. Shoot the two. Two faded. Winner seven. Shoot the four. Fade. There's Little Joe. Little Joe from Kokomo is our point, gentlemen. The point is four. Four is the point. What was it again, Deacon? Three for the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost,... ...in one unity of the three. Seven. Seven deadly sins there,... ...and six ways to make them. Looks like your lucky streak just petered out. Now, you're gonna see a real shooter. I shoot one G. One G faded. You're faded. Winner eleven. I?ll shoot the four. I got thirty-five hundred dollars. What's the matter, doesn't anybody have any money left here? I?ll cover it. Another five hundred against the shooter. It?s my last dollar. Wanna go one more? Last dollar? Four thousand and one. Ten the big point. Seven. Give me a hundred. Thank you, J.C. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One thousand dollars. Faded. Shoot the two. - Faded two. Come on, kid. Keep them coming. Four thousand dollars. I?ll fade the four. Let's see roll the point. Here's your point. - Big ten. Let's see it again. Come on. Make those dice weep. Make the dice sweat. Can't go on with the numbers. There it is, ten. Shoot eight grand. I?ll fade four thousand dollars and that's it. Take all or nothing. Eight thousand dollars. Four thousand dollars is the limit here. This is my game. Eight thousand dollars, all or nothing, or I?m walking. Eight thousand dollars. Should've quit when you were ahead, boy. Point is four. Hey, Fuqua, you ever seen so much money... ...riding on a your dice before? - No, sir. I?ve never seen a single dollar wagered on my dice before tonight. 'Cause you may never see throw four the hard way... ...for this much money again. Sixteen thousand dollars. Shoot it all. Your luck is going to change, son. Bet on it. Come here! Baby. You saved me. I?m gonna be so good to you. Listen, I moved out. I?ve taken a room at the Drake. It?s only for a couple of days. Until we can find a place, if you still want me. Of course I still want you. Cully, I talked to Mr. Green. He said that George came by demanding... ...an extra week to pay off the debt. He said he seemed desperate enough to do anything. I left him five grand. That's more than he deserves. What's he gonna do? I know he can't pay off the debt. Baby, now we can be together. Come here. New shooter coming out. Shoot sixty. Hey, you been holding out on us. You didn't tell us you were Cully the arm. You got some kind of magic or something is what I heard. Ain't no way I?m gonna fade Cully the arm. Any action? Well, I?m not afraid to fade Cully the arm. I think that'll fade you sixty. Go to it, kid. Let's see a natural now. Seven or eleven. That's the kind of magic I like, kid. Is there a J.C. Cullen? New shooter coming out. All right, fifty against this shooter Come on, let's see it. Crap. A loser. Yeah? What's he doing here? - He's working for me. Since when? None of your business. Read the note, George. Carbondale is in Chicago. He has been in the Belleville game. - That's enough. Now he got that note today, and it says the man who blinded me... ...eighteen years ago has been shooting in the Belleville game. Who's the note from? - It isn't signed. You don't think a stool pigeon is in the habit of advertising, do you? Hey, I wouldn't know. Look, I don't care who wrote the note. All I care about is what it says. Now just shut up and listen to me. Have you met a man named Carbondale in the Belleville game? No. How about a man named Carpenter... ...who's got a red heart tattooed right here on his wrist? Yeah. Has he got blond hair? It can even be a little gray now. It?s brown. He dyed his hair, that bastard. He at the Belleville Club now? Why? What are you going to do? What difference does it make? Eighteen years, Cullen, I have waited for this. You stay away from Mr. Carpenter, farm boy,... ...or I?m gonna send you back to Indiana in a bunch of shoes boxes. Goodnight, gentlemen. - Good night. No, I said Ginger Pop in the fourth to win. Thank you. Pete! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Well, George, I said we'd meet again,... ...and here we are. Come on, Pete. Come on, Pete! Cully, you bastard! You gonna pay for this. There was a guy from St. Louis. She was balling him for four weeks. Never was anything but a slut all along. Probably ain't six guys in all Chicago... ...she didn't lay down for. Me and five others. She'd screw anything wearing pants. Who're you talking about? Well, that's none of your business, farm boy. You were talking about Lorry Dane, weren't you? Can you back up what you said? Or were you just shooting off your big mouth like you always do? You better watch yourself, punk. What were you saying about her? I said she's a pig and a slut... ...and a whore. Come here! Come on, Hillbilly! Come on! - Stop it! You hurt him bad! - What happened? Sonny, what happened? I don't know. Cully went crazy. Is he all right. God, what a mess. Don't touch him. Don't touch him. You got what you wanted, you happy, blind man? Carbondale's dead. You happy? You happy? You happy? Cullen! Cullen! Shit. Cully, don't look at me at that way. It?s not what you think. I had to do it. Mr. Green's going to defend George. He can really help us, Cully. He can make sure that George gets put away for life. You understand, don't you? You sent the note to Cole. What? Don't lie to me. Well, I had to do it. Once we got the club away from George... ...he would never have left us in peace. I had to do it. You called the cops, didn't you? Well, I called a detective, a friend of mine. You mean someone you do a little favor for every now and then? Like Mr. Green in there? - Don't treat me like this, baby. You got a man killed just to settle your score with Cole,... ...didn't you? Didn't you? All right! He deserved it. They both deserved it. You were perfectly willing to get me killed, weren't you? No, baby, no! - Weren't you? I would never do anything to hurt you. Please, don't hurt me. Please, don't hurt me. Cully. It looks like Mr. Green just bought himself a striptease club... ...and one crazy little girl to go with it. No, no, don't say that! Cully, please, I can change. I can change. Please, come back. Don't go, Cully. I can change. Yeah, you might. But the odds are against it. Don't go, Cully. Oh, God. It?s for Madigan. But he had it coming. Everything he said about her was true. Is he gonna be okay? Broken nose, two broken ribs. Concussion. If you call that okay. Yeah, well I?m through with Chicago. I?ve talked to Madigan into not presenting charges against you. Good. This way I don't have to tell the police what I know... ...about Carpenter murder. You know I never wanted that. - Yeah, I know. Look, the past is the past and all that. But sometimes... ...it comes back to you whether you want it or not. You know, Cullen, Hooker always spoke so highly of you. The first time he's ever been wrong. Second time. He spoke highly of you, too. Since I met you baby... ... my whole life has changed. Since I met you baby... ... my whole life has changed. And everybody tells me... ... that I am not the same. I don't need nobody... ... to tell my troubles to. I don't need nobody... ... to tell my troubles to. Cause since I met you baby... ... all I need is you. Since I met you baby... ... my whole life has changed. Since I met you baby... ... my whole life has changed. And everybody tells me... ... that I am not the same. Since I met you baby... ... I?m a happy man. Since I met you baby... ... I?m a happy man. I?m gonna try to please you... ... in every way I can.
