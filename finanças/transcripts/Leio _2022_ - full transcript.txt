Woohoo, got one! We've come out this far? DANGER ZONE Let's get the trap and get out of here. Help! Help me! Can I love you just once? If you let me, our love will go on and on You just say "ah, ah" And I will go "ah, ah" If you're ready I'll give you all my heart Gina! See you guys. Bye! Bye! Yo yo yo yo! Yo yo yo! Uh! Thanks. Jane, thanks for getting me this gig. Without this job I'd be so goddamn broke. We're cousins, we look after each other. But hey, are you really leaving your label? Yeah, can't wait. Koy's been sucking my blood long enough. She took a huge cut from every one of my gigs, really huge. Fucking unfair. Good thing I've left. But picking a fight with Koy means trouble. Am I in trouble now? I don't care. She's got nothing on me. Fuck her. A kiss from your lips... Woah! Go, go, go! We're from the anti-narcotics squad. Stay right where you are. We've been informed of an illegal drug party in this club. We're going to search every one of you. Let's get out of here. Please sit down. - What? - You can't leave. What's this? I didn't do shit. We've received intel about a drug party here. But I'm here to perform. Just got off the stage right now. I know nothing about any drug party. I don't do drugs. The urine test will prove that. Go on then. I said I'm clean. KAO ARRESTED IN DRUG BUST Why did Kao think I was taking advantage of him?! But it's best that he decided to quit. He's a junkie, isn't he? Or he's going to ruin our label's reputation. Fuck off. She just called me a junkie! Bitch. Fuck. Somebody must've spiked our drinks. Yeah. We only had water that night. Water is the perfect bait. They spiked it and we didn't even notice. Who would do that? Who else? This bitch is settling the score with me. So it's true that Koy can make or break any singer's career. She can really do that? Let's go to the police. Tell them we were set up. The police are useless. Hi Mom, what's up? What's wrong? You look pale. Grandpa Wut just passed away. LOEI PROVINCE, NORTHEAST OF THAILAND Kao, there's a lot hidden underground. You mean treasure? No. No treasure chests or anything like that. Only a very small river running down there. It's called groundwater. Do you know where it came from? It came from surface water. Rainwater trickled down and collected in sinkholes. We need this rig to drill and pump out the water. Just like we stick this straw in and suck out the milk. Grandpa, that's mine! - Give it back. - Here. WUTTICHAI PUANGCHAROEN MAY 27, 1952 - JUNE 5, 2021 Kao! I'm your big fan. I can sing all your songs! - Can I love you? - Err, we're at a funeral. Right. How about a selfie? Put your arm around me. Whoa. No selfie? Never mind. Oh, almost forgot. I'm Yo, Grandpa Wut's right hand. At your service. Okay. Mom! Auntie... Haven't seen you in ages. I miss you too. How are you? I'm fine. - Hi Auntie. - Hi Kao. You must be tired from the trip. Go get some rest first. I'm good. Don't let us keep you. I'll go prepare the ceremony. Alright. - See you later. - Let me help you. Come. I'll take it. Fon! Welcome Fon. Thanks for coming. You look dazzling. How about a selfie? Sure. One, two, three. One more. Umm. Let me take care of her. You go help Auntie. Well, how are you? I didn't think you would come. I had huge respect for Grandpa Wut, I have to say goodbye to him. And you? Never came home until there's a death in the family. I was super-busy. You know what it's like. You're a top YouTuber with millions of followers. Your schedule must be packed. Yeah, but I always find time to come home every year. Not every ten years, like someone... But I have a show every day! What do you expect me to do? You haven't changed one bit. When you set your mind on something, no one can stop you. Like when you wanted to be a rapper, you dropped everything and went to Bangkok. Leaving everyone behind. You haven't changed either. Bossy as always. Hi Wut! Hi. - Morning, sir. - Hello girl. I heard you've come home. So I've brought you a gift. You shouldn't bother. It's really not a bother at all. Please take it. I want to thank you for helping out my family. All right. And these lizards, look how meaty they are. My daughter made sure to fatten them. Perfect for making side dishes. Let me. Please take it. Yes, they're fat and fleshy. Exactly. Hold it for me. You're in the middle of something right? Yes. Okay then. Take this. You two wait here, I'll go find water for the temple. Okay. Let's go. What're you listening to? Golf & Mike. Golf who? I love FFK. Fay Fang Kaew. What are you doing? I'm Kao. What's your name. I'm Fon. You're like your grandpa, kind and always helping out others. Piakpoon sweets topped with coconut. - Smells so good. - Right. Auntie, I'm leaving now. Oh, okay. Bye. Bye Fon. See you. Umm... bye. Kao, I want to talk about what Grandpa had left for you. Sure. Wow, he left Kao an inheritance? That's awesome. Tada! This is the inheritance? Yes, it has served us for over ten years. Ten years? Looks more like 60. Time to retire it. Don't judge a car by its paint. It may look ancient and beaten up, but it can still roar and rumble. - Kao! - Grandpa! - We've hit a well! - Grandpa! See, when there's a drought we can still find water underground. Every problem has a solution. You just keep looking for it. But when my parents are gone, where can I look for new ones? I'm here. I'll be both your father and mother for you. KAO TEC-9'S NEW SINGLE. AVAILABLE ONLINE NOW. Eight million subscribers celebration! It's Fon, signing in. Thank you so much for subscribing to my channel. I promise to bring only exciting and surprising content to all my fans. Right here, right now! Do you think the background looks familiar? I'm back at Tung Tawan Yang, my hometown. You saw it in my clip last year. But as you can see, the land is parched and the villagers are struggling. So I've come up with a special challenge. I call it "Bring Water Back To Tawan Yang". Top drilling crews will be invited to look for groundwater here. There's a stake in this challenge. The first crew that manages to locate groundwater will receive one million baht in cash. One million! Hey, Yo. Yes? Get this car ready to rumble. Okay. - Here. - Thank you. Damn... every top team is really here. BRING WATER BACK TO TUNG TAWAN YANG, ONE MILLION BAHT PRIZE Make sure everything runs perfectly, the town's image depends on this. This is our biggest showcase event, okay? - Good morning. - Good morning. Hello, thank you so much for supporting this event, Chief. You're welcome. It's our duty anyway. But what inspired you to come up with this project? Well, this is my hometown. It's also an homage to someone I respected. He always wanted us to live in a land of plentiful water. He's already passed away, but I want to make his dream come true. I'm so touched. If you need anything, just let me know. TUNG TAWAN YANG Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining this very special challenge. Tung Tawan Yang is infamous for its aridity and sunbaked land. It's not easy to find groundwater around here. Many have tried, and they have all failed. So one million baht should make up nicely for your hard work today. But let me repeat, only one team will get the prize. Only the first crew that hits groundwater. So keep digging, okay? Next I'd like to invite the Chief to explain all the details. Please give him a hand. That's pretty smart. The first team to find water gets the prize. Dig until you drop, huh. The more teams, the faster you find the water. Never thought I'd see you here. Seriously, you'll give up rap for this one-million-baht challenge? Drilling for water will make me feel close to him like before. Good luck then. That was lame! - Whoa. - What? Cut the sentimental crap! You're here because of the money. Each team will get the same tool kit. A map of underground water courses and a flare. When you hit a well, shoot the flare to declare your location. Now, please complete the registration and pick up your tool kit over there. Thanks again for joining us. TUNG TAWAN YANG Let's go! - Hurry up. - Whoa. - They're so fast! - Come on. Hurry up. This isn't going to be a walk in the park. I know. The soil is hard, there are rocks everywhere. It's a long shot, man. No room for losers. Make way for professionals. Boss Mee's here? We won't stand a chance, let's go home. Who's that clown? Dressed like he's going to a pool party. That's Boss Mee, the bigshot in the drilling business, armed with all sorts of hi-tech machinery. He's far and away the frontrunner. Good morning, Boss mee. - Hi Chief. - Hi. Hi, my gorgeous Fon. I didn't expect to see you here. You usually work on mega-projects, how come you want to join a small gig like this? I usually have no time for child's play. But this is an opportunity for me to work with the gorgeous Miss Fon. And it's for the good of society. A big-hearted person like me couldn't stop myself. Thank you for your interest, Boss. We should have dinner some time soon so we can discuss other charitable projects, sound good? You can just call. Great, then may I have your number? I'll give you my assistant's number. No, I want your personal number. Only my close friends have my number. Can I apply to be one of your close friends? Sorry, the position is not opening now, or soon. Or ever. I can wait. Don't trouble yourself. I said, ever. Don't be so mean. Hey. What's so funny? Are you messing with me? I just can't help laughing at... EVER. Whoa, whoa. Stop! Or they'll beat you up. Back to your own corners, please. - Hold your horses. - He's my friend. Please don't mind him. He can be a pain in the neck. I apologize on his behalf. Oh, he's your friend. Okay. I don't beat up little kids anyway. - Thank you. - No problem. My mood is spoiled. I'll go wait over there. Sure. Just remember, Boss Mee always gets what he wants, okay? See you later. Did we bring the gun? Don't take him seriously. Oops. A warm welcome to everyone. The game is about to begin. Let me invite the architect of this wonderful project, to come up and preside over the official opening. Please welcome her, Miss Fon. Sweetie... So you guys have already got the map and the flare? Yes. Right here. Then let the challenge begin. Three, two, one! Hey, guys! Here we go. Buddha help us. Go! Go! Let's go! Daeng, get in the truck! - Right. - Come on! - Let's go. - Yes. Let's go get it! TUNG TAWAN YANG SUBDISTRICT From the map, there should be a head of a spring around here. How do we know where exactly? Found it? Only rough-textured soil. Hey, right here. We'll dig here. - Here? - Yeah. - Huh? - Why? Well, the technique is called dowsing. Some people believe it can detect underground aquifers. Really? It looks kinda bogus to me. Well, it's not 100% accurate. Maybe 50-50. I saw Grandpa do it when I was a kid. To each his own. We'll see. Genius. Get on it. It's scorching out here. Boss Mee, our radar detects sinkholes around here. But I doubt if there's any water down there. Okay. Dig. Only rough, desiccated soil with no moisture. No chance. Then... - We quit. - Huh? - Quit here and dig somewhere else. - I see. This is our secret... the magical kratom leaves! Take it. Chew it and you'll feel fresh all day. Yes. Let's go. Time to find some water! - Let's move. - Sure thing. One million baht will be ours! Hello... Speak up. Nothing? Then why did you call? I didn't find anything either. What the hell! Idiot. This kratom leaf is cool. I feel so fresh. It gives me a good kick. Good stuff, really. Damn it. No sign of any water. The land is so parched. I don't think there's any water underground. And we won't get paid a cent. - What a waste. - Right. No water, no money. Look. Huh. Hello. Someone is giving you a ride back to town? Great! I'll find someone else to take your job. Thanks, Boss. We'll sell this bike and go get some hot chicks. Yeah. Anything's better than this desert. What's that thing behind us? It's coming! It's coming close! Switch on the turbo! We've made it! Yo, your phone. Who's that? It's an alarm. You usually wake up this late? It's an alarm to give Grandpa Wut his diabetes injection. Grandpa is gone, but I didn't want to turn it off. Did Grandpa ever come to you? He must have already been reborn. Why do you ask? If we fail to win this challenge, we can ask grandpa's ghost to give us lucky lotto numbers instead. Whoa! You're insulting me. I don't need any lotto numbers. I'll use Grandpa's drilling truck to get us the one million. Grandpa's truck? What? The truck's license plate is our lucky number already! Genius. Kao, hold this for a sec. Look at the jackpot money. - They're useless... - Huge money! They pay out this much? LOTTERY OFFICE PLUS - WIN 42 MILLION Kao, wait. Look. What's that? This is an ancient dowsing method. If you suspect there's water underground, lay a plate face-down and wait to see if drops of water collect inside. Got it. What about the weird inscription? To curse cheaters who take what's mine! If you take my plates, the curse will enter your body. They're local thugs. Well, I was joking. You did scare me! The inscription is for warding off vengeful spirits haunting this land. Especially around that big mountain. Don't go anywhere near it, or you'll be sorry. Some things exist even though you can't see them. Okay. Let's go. - A giant snake? - Maybe. Yo. - Yes? - Let's call it a day. Start packing. - Okay. - Right. Thank you. Taking a nap, huh? Stop pretending. Go help Yo over there. - We're going home. - No need to yell. It's jammed. I told Yo to fix it. What's this? What are you doing here? THIS CERTIFICATE IS AWARDED TO CHAYAPON PRASERTWIT I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the medal ceremony. TUNG TAWAN YANG SUBDISTRICT What're you looking at? What is this map? Grandpa Wut's map of underground watercourses. From the Department of Resources and from his own surveys. This is the Holy Grail of groundwater expeditions. Get the other map from Jane. Jane, we need your map. Over here. Spread it. What's going on? Just as I thought. Look at this map. There are no marks around the foothill. Compare it with Grandpa's map. CAVE CAVEMOUTH Right there. You're right. TUNG TAWAN YANG SUBDISTRICT - Thank you. - See you again tomorrow. - Hi. - Have a good rest. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I'm beat. - I'm beat. Let's start fresh tomorrow. - Hello again, Boss Mee. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, Boss Mee. How did it go? Any luck? We hit a rock layers today, but tomorrow we'll find the water. - Really? - Yes. So, I'd like to invite you two to come out to witness my breakthrough tomorrow. Shall we go? Of course. Anyway, it's dinnertime, what would you like to eat? Sorry, I don't eat dinner. Tons of work. Bye then, see you tomorrow. Bye! - Miss Fon. - Bye! Boss Mee, can you take me to see your site? Chief, you had all day to look. - Miss Fon! - Let's go. You know what? I didn't use anything to start this fire. - No way. - I used this guy instead. Woohoo, that's wicked. - My neighbors are more wicked. - How come? The husband has laser eyes. - And the wife is a fire dragon. - Huh. - Their house is always warm. - Wow No need for heaters then. My friend is Cyclops, his eye is a laser. Cyclops my ass. Stop watching superhero flicks! Wait, are you sure this thing is edible? Of course. I trapped tons of them when I was a kid. People don't call me the lizard-killer for nothing. In fact, I'm the Legend of Butterfly Lizard Grills. Once you try it, you'll never go back to chicken. Alright, we'll see. The legend sure takes his time, I've already drunk the whole bottle. Well, let me go water the land first. Call me when it's ready. Okay. Water the land, huh. More like pissing into his own face. If I get 1 million from my beautiful Fon, I'll take her out to watch the moonlight, just the two of us. Look, aren't you afraid of what people talk about? They say powerful earth spirits watch over this place. Nonsense. We've come out this far and seen nothing. I'll skewer those spirits and grill them good. You're dope, man. You want to grill the earth spirits! Daeng, it's ready. Come now or we'll finish them all. Wow, besides butterfly lizards, we're going to have some bats for dinner. What's taking him so long? Shit. Fuck. Run, run! Hey! Where's the key? I don't have it! Shit, Daeng has it. - What? - But he's friggin' dead! What beast has killed him? - What's going on? - An earthquake or what? - The hole we dug is gone. - Damn right. We're safe in the truck. Let's go! The key. Ron, get in the car. I've got the key. Where did he go? You scared the shit out of me. Get in the goddamn truck, moron! So? We've searched everywhere. Not a soul in sight, sir. Their truck is here, their stuff is here, so where are they? Could it be... the curse of Tung Tawan Yang? What curse? You've been away too long. There have been cases of mysterious disappearances around here. People believe they were swallowed by Spirit of Mother Earth. But that's superstition. I think they were kidnapped by human traffickers. Whoa, sounds pretty serious. Chief, we should cancel the challenge. It's too dangerous. Cancel it? Well... Oh! Let me go find a signal. Please excuse me. Boss Mee, you know about the missing persons? We're thinking of canceling the challenge. You can't do that. I'm going to find the water and declare my victory soon. You must not cancel the event. Got it? But it's risky. What if more people go missing? No buts, Chief. You know if I'm happy, everyone will be happy. If I'm disappointed... Damn. That's fucking great. You put the explosives in the van? Are you trying to kill me or what? Give it to him, you idiot. I'm so tired of this. Shit... What? Shit... What the hell is this? We're fucked. Zip your lip. Not a word about this to Miss Fon. The challenge cannot be canceled. Miss Fon, don't pay attention to those superstitious rumors. And even if it's the work of human traffickers, they won't strike the same place twice. You think we should keep going? We don't have any proof that something bad has happened. Let's say we will take extreme precaution, okay? Let's go. Grandpa's map indicates a spring around here. Let's go. Kao. If the spring is inside the cave, how can we get the truck in? How are we going to dig it? We'll think about it later. When we find it, we can carry the equipment inside. Come. Wow. How come I never knew about this cave? You've been here before, Yo? Never. Didn't know about it either. Watch out! - Shit. - You okay? Ouch! Woah. I'm okay. - That was close. - Be careful man. Yo. Did you see something back there? No. Must be bats. I pray it was just a bat... But I think I saw... A ghost! Ghosts don't live in caves. Only bats. If you're scared, stay close to me. Cut it out Yo. Stop horsing around. Nothing to be scared of. Kao. - Yes? - This wall is covered with moss. The surface is pretty damp. There could be a spring head behind it. A million baht is waiting for us behind this cave wall! - Oh my God! - Jackpot! You can finish your album now! Awesome. I have to document this. So we can afford some expensive food now. I ate Yo's peanuts and got a stomach ache. Yo, you'll get your share. So you can stop eating so many peanuts. Yeah, what's up with that? You just eat and eat. Yo. What's up? I think I saw something. Must be bats. - Fuck. - Yo! Jane, run! Come on, Jane! Faster! Careful! Easy, easy. - What're they doing? - Slowly. Wait, what's going on here? We ran into some rocks and hard soils. This calls for an explosive. But is this allowed under the drilling protocol? Black cat or white cat, as long as it catches mice, I don't care. A monster! Run! A monster! It just killed my friend! Run! What? Run! Are they on drugs or something? Shit! Fon, there's a monster! - Huh? - A monster! - What do you mean? - We have to get out of here! What're you talking about? - Wait! - What are you saying? What monster? A monster, it ate Yo alive! I'm not crazy, - you have to get out of here! - No. You're not making any sense. Let me go. I saw it, I saw the monster! - Kao! - Let me go! See? I told you there's a fucking monster. It's down there, we have to get to high ground. Run Fon. Run! - What the hell is that thing? - Where did it go? - What on earth is that thing? - I don't know! Some kind of monster, I've told you! Are we safe here? I've seen a movie about a giant worm that ate townspeople. We're safe up here. Hey, keep it down. Fuck!!! This one's faster than the worm! Wait for me! Fon, run! Hurry up! Shit! What're you doing? It's coming here! This might be a new species of dinosaur discovered by Grandpa Wut. What should we call it? Mega Giant Butterfly Lizard? Mega Giant Butterfly Lizard? Nah. Kao! Fon... Fon. It was quite a drop, we were so lucky. Let's find a way out. What the fuck is that? A chemically-infected mutant lizard? Or an extraterrestrial beast? Or is it some sort of mythical creature, like the Naga? What the hell is it? The heck I know. I just saw it, like you! Anyway, can you move your head? Where is it? I'm so scared. Maybe it's gone. Which way now? What's right is what's life. We'll go left. That simple? A wrong turn and we end up in its belly. We can't see what's up ahead, we have to take our chances. As usual. Once you've made up your mind, you won't listen to anyone. Is that a phone? How come there's a phone down here? It's coming from this way. Still want to go left? Left doesn't look so bad. Come on. Goddamn lizard. No signal, or I'd call an F-16 to bomb the fucker into smithereens. I have an idea. What're you doing? Start the truck. It'll come and eat you. You're right. Are you daft or what? Well, there's another vehicle we can use. Which one? That one. Right, I forgot I came here in my van. What's the plan? We can't just leave this truck. I'll check if it's awake or sleeping. Easy. It will hear you. Not too much, it'll bite your hand off. Look, it's sleeping. Right. Who'll go first? Lady's first, of course. You're a real gentleman. Are you sure it's this way? More promising than the other way. This cave is huge. Damn! Skeletons! Dead bodies everywhere! It's the monster's dining room! Err, aren't you supposed to be macho and all that? You're as scared as a little girl. It's just a reflex. You know, natural reactions. Not just the dining room, it's a nursery too. Just as I thought. There's more than one. This is pretty hairy. We have to get out of here. Look there. - Yo. - Yo? - Yo. - Yo. Yo. Yo. - He's breathing. - What do we do? Yo. As hard as a rock. Kao. - What? - There are more people buried there. Did it kidnap these people for late-night meals? Or maybe to feed its babies. Let's get the hell out. Kao, wait, Kao! Quiet. Don't wake it up. Slowly. Very slowly. Careful. Easy. It will hear you. Go. Fuck you. Stop, Kao, stop! What? We can't just leave Yo and those people. We can't do anything. We should get out of here first. You're always like this. You always abandon your people, like you did to me and Grandpa. Go on, but I'll stay. Grandpa Wut would never leave anyone behind. How do you know he never left anyone behind? THIS CERTIFICATE IS AWARDED TO CHAYAPON PRASERTWIT Something urgent came up. Well, let me see your medal. Wow, first prize. Let me put it on you. You're just like Mom and Dad. You said you loved me but you never have time for me. So, don't tell me Grandpa never left anyone behind. Now I remember... If Grandpa had gone to your medal ceremony, I wouldn't be here today. Did you ever ask him why he didn't show up? Help me! Help me please! Help me! Hang in there! - What happened? - She was bitten by a snake. A snake? - Let me help you. - Hang in there! My dad couldn't drive, your grandpa took me to the hospital. KEEP FIGHTING, KAO Get on. Hurry up. You good? - Yes. - Let's go! I knew Grandpa Wut. He would never leave you. Really. Don't be so sentimental. We're still trapped in the monster's lair. Exactly who's being sentimental? You know what? I never wanted to leave those people. I said let's get out of here so we can get help. Didn't you see, those rocks are indestructible? You should've said so from the start. Er... Which way? You looked so confident before. Hey. What? Peanuts. Right... and? Yo's peanuts. Lots of them. So? So we should follow the trail. Wait for me. The exit is right this way. What are you doing? Leave markings, so we can return to help Yo. You're smart. Keep going and we're out of here. Fon, wait. This is weird. It doesn't look natural. More like some kind of man-made wall. The soil is damp. There might be water behind this. But I wonder who'd build a wall here. I heard underground reptiles hate water. Maybe the giant lizard made this wall to keep out water. It's possible. Let's get out of here. Come on. Did you hear that? Over there. - Hey. - Hey guys! What's going on? Listen, a monster is coming! Get in the van! - What? - What monster? A giant butterfly lizard! We have to run, now! - Get in the van! - Are you on crack or something? Actually, we look like we're on crack. Giant. Lizard. A giant or a lizard, or a giant lizard? Look, moron! Fuck, a giant lizard! I told you! You got any weapons? Something to fight it? We make love, not war. But we have a little something for self-protection. Whatever you have, get it out! A little something? Guys... Charge! - Let's roll! - Watch out. Hey, you okay? Shit. Fuck. Fon! Fon! Fon! - Hey. - Let me go! You wanna get your head bitten off, huh! I have to help Fon! Too late, man! She's fucking dead! No, she's not. The fucker just kidnapped her to feed its babies. If we go now, we still can help her. Kidnap? It just swallowed her! Yeah, that didn't look like kidnapping to me. It only took young and healthy humans to feed its babies. It took her down that hole and ignored us completely, didn't you see that? Maybe you're right. Or maybe it's all in your head. Whatever. I'm going down there. What can you do? We fired a salvo and the motherfucker didn't budge. He's right. Is anyone coming? Shall we fire another? Here they are. You found the water? Where? I don't see it. I need your help. Kao, Kao! Kao, Kao! Goddamn... I'm so glad you're still alive. I was so scared the monster would get you. Well, here I am. What did you say? Monster? Yeah, monster. Damn, it's scary as hell. I've got a plan, but we have to work together to make it succeed. I'm out. Many people have died, why take the risk? Right. Call the army or the police. We're just water diggers. Yeah. If we keep arguing, those people are going to die! We have to do something now. - Count me out. I don't want to die. - Me neither. I understand that you don't want to take the risk. But are you really going to walk away and abandon those people? I once left someone I cared about so much, and now I regret not being able to see him again. I had that chance, but I let it slip away. Please, I beg you. We should help them while there's still a chance. Don't just stand there and watch. We have to help them. We want to help. But seriously, what can we do? My grandpa once told me every problem has a solution. You just have to keep looking for it. I believe we can do this if we work together. We can pull it off. Awesome pep-talk. Whoever says no is a wimp. What? Alright, let's give it a shot. What do you say? - Okay. - Okay. - Right on. - I'm in. Fon! Fon! First, get its attention and lure it out. Almost there. Second, set a trap. When we make a noise, the lizard will come out to get us. Then some of us go down with the equipment to help the kidnapped. It's coming out! It's going to snap! Fon! Hey! Yo. Why am I here? Where.. where's the monster? What are you saying? Hit it. Full throttle! You're fucking dead! - Let's go! - Kill it! Take that! Shit. Fucking lizard! Eat this! It went down there! Jane's in danger. Go help Boss Mee. Boss! Boss Mee! Boss! What! Am I not dead? Help me. I can't move... Help! Hurry up! It's coming back. Hurry up. Faster. It's here. I don't want to die! Boss Mee! - Not that way, goddamnit. - Boss Mee! Forget him. Let's keep moving. I'm good now, please help him. - Get up. - Get up now! Move! Let's go! Yo, are you okay? Jane, did you get everyone out? Except Boss Mee. He freaked out and ran away. And Fon? She's with us. Where? Where did she go? She was right behind me. Shit, she's probably gone to get Boss Mee. Wait. - What? - What's the next step? Finally, set Boss Mee's explosives against the wall, detonate them, and the water will chase the monster away, Do it now! No, Fon and Boss Mee are still down there. If not now, we're all fucked! I have to get them out first. Goddamnit. How? Okay. Give me the detonator. Huh? You get everyone to safety. - But you... - Go now. We don't have time. Let me finish it. Boss Mee. Can you hear me? Where the hell did he go? You went the wrong way. That's a new one. Boss Mee! Why did you come this way? - Help me! - Let me help you. Get me out. Okay, follow me. You think you can run? Boss. Fon! Shh.. - Kao! - Quiet! This is not the way out? Don't worry. I've got a Plan B. Okay? Shit! Kao. Kao. - Shhh. - Kao! Quiet! Kao! Up there! Shit! Fon! Hey, I'm over here! Over here, you fucking monster. You softass lizard! Come get me! Don't run away like the last time! I'm right here, in the phone! Stupid reptile! Lizard fucker! What're you waiting for? It's coming. Was that a bomb? What did you do? Come on! Faster! This way. Up here. You sure the water won't reach us? It's over, isn't it? Shit! Kao! Let go of me. Let go of me. No. Let go of me. Let's go! Is it over now? Please, I'm so fucking tired. Is it coming after us? Kao! Kao! Fon! Kao! Fon! Shit. You've killed it, right? We did it! I guess... You guess! Shit! Don't tell me... We hit the water. - We hit the water! - Yes Let's take a photo. Water! A group selfie. We look like a trainwreck. We've won the prize! Not the time to ask Fon for the prize. Look! The lotto jackpot! Yes! Yes! Whao! - I'll go get the truck. - See you later... What's with those two? So you didn't get the prize? I did. I'm looking at it now. I mean the water. The water, and you. That's lame. Thanks for not leaving me behind.
