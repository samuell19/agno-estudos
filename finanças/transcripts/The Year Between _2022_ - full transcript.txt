Bitch, seriously, like, just go fucking kill yourself. Just, like, I literally wanna just kill me. I'm judging you. Freaks. Oh, like, it's me. Yep, yeah. Yep, every single time. Don't ask me what's in the bag. It's not your bag. Shit. You wearing my chapstick? -What? No. -I can smell it. No, you can't. E-- everybody wears chapstick. Yeah, but mine is shortcake-flavored and, uh, I smell shortcake. Clemence, I don't ever touch your stuff. You're the one who's always selling my stuff on the internet and I don't ever say-- Do you know how hard it is to live with you? Look at this fucking place. It's a zoo. Hey. You're supposed to notify me -when you have guests. -Help! Open this goddamn door, Clemence, and leave that poor girl alone. It's okay, Eliza, -don't be afraid. -You didn't. I had to, you're ruining my college experience. -You've had enough. I can take care of my fucking self! -Leave me the fuck alone! -Stop it. ...disgust. And as we've watched these negotiations go forward, I mean, there is a-- a graveyard chock-full of proposals that have been floated and have already died. Um... - Someone should bomb this place. - That's not funny. Hey, I wasn't saying I'm gonna do it, just that someone should. Shut up. Whoa. Why are we going down here? I came the minute Eliza called so there wasn't much time to, uh... yeah, well. Okay, this is... a good place for me to die. We did clean up a little, though. You should've seen it before. Oh, was there, like, sewage on the ground? I'm sorry, but we-- we already turned your room into a home office for Dad. He needs the space, he's overworked. School is really hard this year. Oh, yeah? Well, poor Dad. All right? I'm overworked. By the system. The institution, you know? And-- and I'm underpaid as well. Look, no offense, Clem, but we didn't expect you back. We thought you'd be, like, getting a degree. Well, I got distracted. This isn't ideal for anyone, but, uh, we'll figure it out. We'll put you back on your feet. Beep-beep. Taking orders here for welcome home barbecue. Burger or dog? Oh, the funniest thing happened at school today. One of my juniors, this kid's nuts, he took the lyrics from a rap song-- Do we have ketchup? Uh... I think we raised a lot of money today. From my 3K. -For cerebral palsy. -I thought it was a 5K? Well, you could, like, choose the distance -you wanted to do. -So what's wrong with Clemence? Nothing's wrong. She's... -been like she's always been. -She's batshit insane. We don't know that for sure. What is wrong with you? Shh. What is wrong with her? Clemence Elizabeth Miller. You put my middle name on the thing? Go on, that's you. Come on. It'll be okay. Jesus. Basket case. Hello. Clemence? -Please, sit. I'm Dr. Lismoen. -I'll stand. - Sit down. - I'll sit. Thank you both for coming in. I'm glad we could work this out with short notice. On the phone you mentioned that... Well, I-- I think it would be best if you just told me the full story. Um, I guess-- Well, I got a call from her college roommate and things apparently have been going downhill for quite some time. Uh, hoarding, stealing, paranoia, staying up 'til 4:00 or 5:00 a.m., -shrieking-- -Shrieking? She is dead to me. I'm sure that would make it difficult for your roommate to sleep. Clemence, have you ever been diagnosed with ADHD? Self-diagnosed. I got-- I got a guy at school who, um, sells me Vyvanse and other stuff such as weed. Well, I run a home goods store so I'm-- I'm very perceptive about people's needs and I, personally, have always felt that she might have a brain disorder. I mean, she's very different -from my other kids. -Wow. Do you feel like you have dramatic highs? I mean that last for days? I don't know. May-- ye-- maybe. And afterwards, you crash? You feel hopeless and-- and lose all the spark? I guess maybe yeah? It sounds like you're experiencing episodes of mania and-- and depression. What I'm leading to is bipolar disorder. Uh... -'Kay. -Um, so what-- -Why are you being such a freak? -Hello? - Don't fuck with me. - Okay. She's 100 years old. Why should we trust her? Are those my shoes? I don't know, they were at the front door, okay? With medication and therapy, you can eventually begin to feel better, normal. So, um, what do we do next? I mean-- I just want to be sure that Clemence is listening because she's the one who will be responsible for her treatment. I hear you. With bipolar disorder, some people experience racing thoughts. Binge eating, overspending, stealing. Delusions of grandiosity. You might feel like you have superpowers. You don't. Bitch. First, you'll want to sit your family down and explain. Your treatment could mean change for everyone. All right, so, you got mania and depression. It's basically two diseases, but one. So then it's mainly mental? - 100% mental, Dad. - Well, that's good. At least you're going to survive it. I mean, not necessarily. As a future med student, I obviously know what a mental illness is. There's a medical explanation for why she's a mess. That's, like, rude, - but accurate. - Can I go now? Where do you have to be on a Monday night? Um, anywhere but here? Thank you all for coming to my TedTalk. We should start you on medication to stabilize you. Miller. I'll start you on, um, 1,200 mg of lithium per day. This is on the higher side. We need to keep your thoughts from racing. Help prevent those manic episodes. Get a life, townies. You also need to stabilize your mood, so we'll add an antidepressant. It will take time to get your cocktail of medications right. And not just the combination, but the dosage. We need to find the balance. And while we look for that balance for your cocktail, there will be side effects, some worse than others. Question, how is this worth $250 an hour? - I, uh-- - Don't answer that. ♪ Feels like I'm falling apart ♪ ♪ I'm falling apart ever so slowly ♪ ♪ Fading ♪ - Babe. What was that? - Huh? ♪ Fading away ♪ ♪ 'Til I'm out of sight ♪ The moments of absolute genius you describe are most likely episodes of mania. Heightened energy, euphoria, confidence, and generally skewed perception of your own ability. Yes. That is a lot of bread. And the nausea. Well, let's take you off the Lexapro then, -you might risk-- -Fuck! -Clemence. -It's hard, I know. But we'll find the right balance. It just takes time. Until then, make sure you're getting enough sleep, and absolutely no drugs or alcohol, none. Well, maybe I should just kill myself, then. That reminds me, you should start seeing a therapist. Oh, and-- and how much is that gonna run me? Doctor said routine. ...walk the fucking dog. Chauncy! -Hi, Mrs. Guery. -Hi. - How are you? - Good. Good, yeah. How's it going? Fine, everything's great. Oh, good. That's good. -Tell your mom I said, "Hi." -Take care. - Mom's pissed. - Where the hell were you? We are sacrificing a lot around here if you haven't noticed, and I'm not paying $250 an hour for you to go missing like a goddamn idiot. Well, I didn't ask you to sacrifice shit. Well, I didn't ask for a mental patient, but life is full of surprises. Walking the fucking dog! She needs serious help. ... She didn't come to dinner, right? And then she didn't come home 'til, I don't know, 1:00 a.m. or something and-- Don't really know why I need a therapist, considering I've already hired this German woman to run my life. I don't even know if the meds are helping me or making it worse. I cannot fall asleep at night and everyone hates me. The German woman is your psychiatrist? I call her "the German woman" to take away some of her power. Uh, what are you thinking about? At night? Well, mostly a novel that is in some ways very similar to Jurassic Park, but is-- explores feminism and is set in rural Illinois. That sounds really good. - I know. - Bye, hon. Has anyone seen a graphing calculator? - Oh, yeah, I took that. - Shut up. - Okay, we gotta go. - Relax. Being able to do equations is not gonna make a difference -in your life. -Why would I listen to you? So I can end up spending a Monday -eating cereal in a robe? -As opposed to what? Okay, uh, last time I was late, Coach made us all swim ten laps and I got punched in the shower, so can we just-- can we go? Look, I survived high school, okay? And if I were you-- Okay, I don't take life advice from mentally ill burnouts. Those words can't hurt me. It's called a brand. You know, maybe you should find one instead of school principal trapped in a teenage body, oh, shit. Come on, Carlin, let's go, come on. - Okay. - Shit. Why don't you open up those bills and see how much you're sucking Mom and Dad dry. Dick. Why don't you suck me dry? Jesus, Carlin. Kids took their unit test today. We're doing supply and demand now. Kids always love that. TINSTAAFL. That's an acronym, actually. T-I-N-S-T-A-A-F-L. There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Because borrowing always leads to debt. Kids are talking about making merch. That's weird. Well, believe it or not, Clem, some kids like school. No one likes school, Dad. You used to like school. I seem to remember a certain someone's eighth grade graduation speech? Well, I don't remember it. What's wrong with this thing anyway, what happened? Dad, just leave it. Well, just tell me, I can fix it-- Dad, if the house burns down I want to sleep through it. Fine. Good night, Clem. Love you. Dad. Dad. Hey, excuse me. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Can I, uh, apply for a job here? Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, probably, um, I would have to check with my manager-- I used to shop here in high school, but now I'm in college, mentally. Yeah, you know what, the thing is, I think he went home already. Do you just have, like, one of those applications, I could just fill it out or... You can take it home and bring it back another day, the store closes in about five minutes. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, I'll just do it now. I don't have any, like, previous experience or references or emergency contacts. -Then what do you have? -I got a name. And an address and a dream. - Yeah. - Hmm. Mm. Address is temporary, though. I'm living with my parents right now, um, I'm basically already moved out. I just need to get some cash so I can get myself, -like, a condo situation. -Why are you bald? Wow, that's fucking rude. ♪ They call it Xanadu ♪ ♪ And now open your eyes and see ♪ Oh! Oh, shit, it's Clemence Miller! What's up? -What's up? -Why are you bald, girl? I had a mental breakdown. - Word. - Yeah. Um, why are you here in town? -I live here. -You live here? -For real? -Like, for real. Since Marshall. Whoa. So you don't, like, go to college or anything? -Fuck no. -Weird. Why? Oh, sh... I, um-- yeah, I totally have a... No. See you. Dude, where the fuck you going? - Dude. - I got a... I got a little-- - Tires are all fucked up. - Yeah, I get you. -Hey. -What happened to your head? Those are my gym shorts. Yeah, I found them in a bag in your room. I got a job. I applied for a job. -Oh, Clem, that's great. -Wearing that? Well, it's at a place called Big Deals, not the fucking mayor's office. -I got the dog bed there. -Exactly. Anyway, I know you got bills to pay and, uh, I'm living here and eating all your food and she totally made me feel bad about it. So, I thought... hell, I'll-- I'll chip in a little bit. Well, that's okay. I'm sorry. Are we supposed to be, like, impressed? - Here we go. - Okay, shut up, Neil. All right, Carlin. Just chill out. All right? Just take a breath. Carlin, this isn't about you. -Yeah, obviously not. -Okay. This is the most important semester of the most important year of my entire life. Okay. Okay, if you don't know, the ACTs will literally determine my future. - Ugh, just kill me. - Clem. Okay, li-- I can't focus while I'm walking on eggshells 'cause we're living with a crazy person. Like, can we just see if you hold the job a week -before giving you a gold medal? -What the fuck do you know? I've been taking, like, 9,000 pounds of drugs per day and I applied for a job. What are you doing except, like, raising five bucks for random diseases? We raised $650 for cerebral palsy, asshole. - Cool. - Yeah. Hey, it's gonna be in the 50s tomorrow. We both live here, so if I'm a loser, so are you. You're winners and always welcome here. Don't say that, Don, it isn't true. Mom, I'm going to appointments, I'm taking my pills, and I am trying to get the fuck out of here, so what else do you want me to do? -Do you want me to go to church? -Couldn't hurt. God, can you just stop acting like a child all the time? No. Stop taking my gym clothes. I need them for gym. Also no. You failed raising those two. Good night. Oh, my God. The size of the elk population calls for sustainable management... ...and her Swedish colleague are searching for fresh feeding... Hey, can you meet me upstairs at 7:00 a.m.? -Wear a sports bra. -Yeah. Carlin, meet me downstairs at 7:00 a.m. Shit. The research project has been running for ten years now. And the two biologists work well together. The two experts know their known habits. Huh. Happy Saturday. It's 7:02. Fuck. Do we have any of those chia bars? No, I need to go to Costco. - Hello. - Mm. You might need to-- -to go shopping. -Oh, well. With your new employee discount. - You're a discount. - Enough. I have only one hour before work. - Go to your mat. - This is a towel. Towel. Okay. Welcome to my little slice of the Himalayas. A couple months ago, my body started hurting and I was just tired all the time. I was, uh, overworked or stressed. Anyhow, I discovered YouTube. Everyone says that yoga is good for you, but the classes were expensive, so I started watching these tutorials. And after just a few weeks, I started getting stronger, and now I just take an hour before work every day -and I downward dog right here. -Weird. And I have to say, it has given me peace. It has helped keep me healthy and helped me to relax and to concentrate. And your dad and I have been, uh, looking on the internet and we see that exercise and meditation is good for people with the, uh, bipolar. And strength and relaxation - is good for everyone. - Mom. -Do we have bread? -No. Okay, so what am I supposed to use? -Defrost a bagel. -This doesn't feel peaceful. Yeah, maybe because you-- While you're in here... you'll listen to me and relax, dammit. Now, take a deep breath. And release through the mouth. That's right. Seated tadasana. Put your arms together. Behind your head. Stretch up, and into goal posts. All three of you? Every day? Yeah, it's fucking brutal. And now we'll do butterfly. Palms and feet together, and forward. You should feel a deep stretch. Well, I think it's great. You know, they talk a lot about the mental benefit of exercise in this book that I highly recommend. I do not read. And now Savasana. All the way down. Breathe. Spine melting into your mat. All right. I have 800 fake flowers to wash today. - I'm showering. - No, I'm showering. No, I'm showering. I'm the one who has a job. - Cool. - Good work today. If you want another class, you know where and when. What will you do with the gift that is today? Yogibabi33 asks this question. Who? Well, I'm never doing this shit again, I need, like, 12 hours of sleep every night. I don't need to relax. I'm relaxed.

Clem Miller? -Er, yeah. -Hi, girl, you look amazing. -I love your... jeans. -Who are you? It's Ginger. Remember? Oh, my God, I don't think I've seen you since Marshall. Yeah, there's a reason for that. You know, I always thought that leaving high school was the worst thing to have ever happened to me, but turns out, becoming a mom is the best thing to ever happen to me, you know? Oh, are you looking for a job? 'Cause I'm actually looking for a nanny for Harley Quinn so we could-- Look, "Ginger." First of all, I have no memory of you. Also, I'm here, looking for a book, because my psychiatrist wants me to read about bipolar people, because I'm clinically batshit insane and there's no telling what I might do. For sure. Oh, God... You'll probably find something good here. Good. Can I like, um-- Do you wanna, like, t-- talk-- talk about it? What is this? Where are the real books? Oh, if it's not there, that's all there is, I think. No one really comes down here, which is fucked up. We need to, like, normalize mental health. How'd you go from teen mom to librarian? That feels really random. They were hiring. I needed to figure something out. Yeah. What led me to the path of psychiatry was my own experience with bipolar disorder. When I was 24 years old, I was found by my mother swimming in icy cold water, unable to feel anything. My life was at risk and I didn't know it. - I would assume-- - My name is Lee. So I worked at a bar for five years and the less sleep I got, the more crazy my schedule was, uh, the more I felt like I wanted to punch people in the face. And then one time I did. And that's when I was like, "Oh, this isn't normal." Yeah, I tried all that stuff. It just wasn't for me. I had this therapist, she didn't get me. So I gave up on all that. So, first I went in and they thought it was ADD, then depression, and finally they got it right. It definitely hasn't been easy on my relationship. It's a lot to take on for someone you live with, and I get that, I mean, it's, like a lot... I've been on lithium for 22 years. Had my hands shake and my body completely dried out. Those pills-- I wasn't living my life. Barely functioning. And now I am, so that's how I know-- I'm reading that book from the German woman. -Kind of. -How is it? Lame. One time I ran in front of a train, like, it almost ran me over, but-- Yeah, I mean, I-- I la-- I laugh about this stuff now, so... Now I run five miles a day and I am ten years sober. It's important to note that-- Can we listen to something else? This sucks. No. - Hello? - Clemence Miller? Hey there, it's Ricky calling from Big Deals. Oh, wow, uh, I did not think I'd hear from you.

It is I. Hey, you look ready. Yeah, I went, uh, business-cazh. Well, you know, the good news is that you get a 10% off employee discount. -Oh. -And the better news is that Beth is gonna be doing your training today. Hey, Beth, Clemence is ready to rock. Mm... Well, hi, Clemence. - Hi, Beth. - Right on. You know what? I feel it. You guys are gonna be besties. All right. Work hard, play hard, right? - Yeah. - Peace. Huh. So, uh, if I remember correctly, you have zero experience doing anything? -That is correct. -Mm. Great, great. I guess I'll start with teaching you how to fold a shirt. Oh, should we-- should we hug first, maybe? I don't know. Since we're equals now. Like, I, an idiot, -have the same job as you. -Mm. Yeah, but you're a college dropout and I've already got a lacrosse scholarship at Duke. Hmm, true, but what even is lacrosse? -You know? -What? It's my way in. I'm probably gonna do comp-sci, you know, like developing. I'll be building apps by the time you learn to refill the paper towels in the bathroom. -I got an idea for an app. -I really don't want to hear it. Aren't you a kid? Why are you so boring? Like, why aren't you frolicking? -People like you annoy me. -Oh, crazy people? -Yeah, actually. -Uh-huh. -It's like everything's a joke. -Mm. You just dick around and bother people. -Yeah, mm-hmm. -You probably live at home doing nothing with your life. -Correct. -You can't even fold a shirt. My hands shake sometimes 'cause I take a lot of medicine. We get a lunch break? Yeah. These side effects are bullshit. How is your mood? I mean, fine, I mean-- I mean, I don't know, like-- To me, you seem much better. Yeah, well, how am I supposed to keep a job to pay for you if my hands are shaking all over the damn place? My memory is shit, my skin sucks, and my hair is-- my hair was falling out and I keep randomly falling asleep in the Big Deal storage closet. There will always be side effects, Clemence, so you may as well accept that right now. Great, that is great and you know what, that book? It sucks. It's so boring. Clemence, I gotta tell you, life is full of side effects. What does that even mean? Well, why don't you tell me what you think it means? Holy shit, why can't you ever just give me a straight answer? -I hate you. -And that's totally valid. I thought I'd turn 21 while shotgunning Four Loko, but this is-- this is cool, too. Dad? What? This damn dog, I mean, all it does is eat, shit, - and destroy. - I mean, same. Yeah. How was school? I took the day off, spent it with your mom. Why? This is the first sick day I've taken in five years. - Are you sick? - I'm beat. For seven hours every day, I stand in front of 30 kids trying to get them to pay attention to me. I need these four hours between work and bed - and doing it all again. - Okay, TMI. Why don't you just tell me to shut the hell up? -That's what Mom always does. -Okay, shut the hell up. Damn. I'm-- I'm sorry, Clem, I don't-- I... Everything will be okay. Yeah, people always say that. What? "Everything will be okay." That is literally insane and I don't get why people say it. Yeah, I guess you're right. What do you mean I'm right? Well, honestly, I think... I think, I mean, after a point, chaos settles. I mean, you don't know how long it'll take, but then eventually, it all just dulls. And that feels like it's the end product of, "Everything will be okay." - Um, cryptic. - Yeah. I'll finish with this shit. -Really? -Yeah. -Thanks. -Yeah. -Maybe you can walk him too? -Yeah. For sure. All right, dude, let's go. Let's go. Come on, Chauncy. -So, how did you celebrate? -Let's cut the shit. I know you don't care. But listen... there's this guy who's kind of like... And I-- I guess I'm just wondering, well, I-- I just-- I just really-- I really hope I'm not like him. -Does that make sense? -You mean like a crush? Ugh, no, God, what's wrong with you? Forget it. Well, sometimes when we're down, we're attracted to people who reflect the worst in us. Look, besides the whole mental illness thing, I am just wondering if I have, like, a bad personality? What makes you say that? Everything. Hey, Mikael, can you take my shift Sunday? -I have church. -I guess. - You do not. - Thanks. I just have my grandmother's-- Beth, um, what do I do if someone tries to return something that has, like, wax on it? Like, this woman came in and she was like, um, "My blazer is covered in wax." And I-- I let her return it because I'm not here to judge. Clemence, if it's dirtier than when we sold it, -they don't get a refund. -Right, I just thought-- Like, do you actually think somebody's gonna want to buy that blazer? Well, I should hope not, 'cause it was devastating. Oh, my God, look, just go take your lunch break, - okay? - Oh, thank you. Oh, well, not you, Mikael, you stay. I just-- I need to eat something. Beth, wait. Okay, I hate to ask this, but, um... if I pay for it... do you wanna go get a sandwich? Even though I make the same wage as you and probably less 'cause Ricky thinks I've been stealing shoes. Which is true. He's so perceptive. Fine, fine, come on. Could you guys, um-- if I gave you money, could you guys get me something? Mikael, you're a pro. 'Cause my, um, blood sugar is, like, really low. I have no idea where my card went. Yeah, you owe me $12. I can't believe you're in high school. You feel so old. Or maybe you're trapped in your childhood. Yeah. But, um, you're definitely going to college, then? -Definitely. -Yeah. Yeah, I, uh, took the ACT over the summer. I got a 35, scholarship locked, it's-- it's all figured out. Can't wait to get out of this place. Yeah. Yeah, but, um, also, like, -college kind of sucks. -Huh. Yeah, I mean, you gotta do you, of course, but, um, in my opinion... - don't go. - I'm going. Okay. Um, how are you so smart in school and, like, playing a rich person sport, but you also work at a shitty store? Mm, see, if I fuck up my life, nobody's gonna let me live in their basement. You must think I really love working at Big Deals, huh? But I hate it as much as you do. And I do it anyway. Shit. You're wise. I feel like I'm Pocahontas and you're that old tree. Do you have any friends? I had some in college, um, but then I went crazy and dropped out and they stopped calling because they were afraid. -It's chill. -Shit. Sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends? Yeah. Flex. So you guys, like, go out or--? I mean, yeah, I-- I guess. Ha, nice. So, like, um, like, where? And when? Hey, can you stop? You want to go to a party next weekend? Copped an invite. -But you don't know people. -Well, I know my colleagues. And, uh, like, she-- she implied I was invited and, you know, I think therefore implied that -I get a plus one. -The diabetic? Mikael would never go to a party. It would kill him. Now, this girl is really, like, mature, she's obsessed with being an adult and, like, you know, having a bright future and I really think you guys would hit it off -in a really annoying way. -Oh, my God. It's here. I-- I took so many practice tests, I... -Uh-- -I-- I thought I-- Mom. Oh, no. Just no, just-- I mean, how am I gonna-- I mean, when am I gonna-- -That's only nine points -It's just a test, right? -above the national average. -It's a-- -It's a simulation from -I don't test well, I-- corporate America and-- and it doesn't mean shit. It means everything, Clemence. Okay, top schools, they want a 32 or higher. -Everyone knows that, okay? -I don't know that. I mean, without it, I mean, med school, I can't, I can't. Okay, okay. Just-- just stop. Okay? Stop. Okay, you still have your whole fucking future ahead of you. So... while we're still young... you and me are gonna go to what might be... the event of the year.

No. Then for God's sake, -don't put your DNA in anything. -Well, okay. - Why-- why can't you just-- - W-w-what? Why can't you just let me have anything? Because I need to mold you. I-- I'm just trying to not have to deal with all your shit, like, all the time. I-- It's not fair, okay? Well, it's not fair that my brain is broken... - I don't care! - ...and my life sucks, okay? Should I have to suffer that alone? You look good. -Do you have a brother? -Shh. Ashik? It's just me, Mom. Go back to bed. What are you doing? -Who's there? -No one. Go back to sleep. Sorry, um, you-- you get it. For sure. Down here. -I have to pee. -Bathroom's right there. Oh. Your basement's a lot nicer than mine. Do you know Weyes Blood? Jesus. Are you, like, standing right outside the door? Sorry, do you want me to wait upstairs while you pee? No. Setting the mood? Dude, why are you going out of your way to scare me off? I thought you'd rather kill yourself than spend five minutes with me. Oh, please. Honey, I've thought about it. You want a drink? Uh... no. I'm good. -How 'bout an Adderall? -What? It's like a stimulant drug for ADD or, you know, whatever. Yeah, I-- I-- I know what it is. I mean, I basically went to college once. So you want one? Uh, no, I'm on, um... antibiotic... for a skin... I got a rash on my leg, I... have a-- a staph infection. Dude, that sucks. It sucks, but, it's, um... It's totally harmless. My pediatrician prescribed it to me for, like, helping me fill out job apps and stuff. Oh, God. Your baby doctor? How's that going for you? -It's tight. -Yeah? Dude, I got this dope new projector thing. Can I show you some visuals? I guess. ♪ Beauty, a machine that's broken ♪ ♪ Running on a million... ♪ -Is it just you down here or... -Yup. ♪ People trying, don't cry... ♪ What about the guy in the pictures? Upstairs.

I'm so sorry, it's so late, I just needed to call you to tell you that I'm finally gonna write my novel. Despite you. Basically went down on me for, like, nine hours and then I just was sort of, like, "All right, let's do this, dude." But anyway. Neil! What are you doing in here? Why don't you have any pictures of us? Get out, Clem. You have everyone who's important on the wall. Can you get out? Please? Are you okay? No. So, um, what's up with you? What do you mean? Well, I mean, you don't look well. Like, you always look unwell, but right now-- Well, I feel amazing. Clemence-- You know, I think I can just sort of, like, potentially sell these on, like, an Ebay, or something like that, you feel? I feel. ♪ Take me away ♪ Hey. Hey, I don't know why you did that. Clemence, don't you get that you were actually lucky -to have this job? -No, I had not considered that. But, um... good luck with college and... uh, the app and la-- lacrosse and, um, you know, just don't-- don't get too sucked into, like-- Remember that-- that-- that party I mentioned? No, not-- no, not really. Well, uh... it's this Saturday, okay? No, I really don't want that there. I'm trying to declutter. Where do you want it? Well, how about back in the goddamn box? I don't need my kitchen looking like Star Wars. God, it's a fucking juicer. And this is also my kitchen and I want the goddamn juicer in my kitchen. Sher, they said that we should try to... Look, it's restaurant-grade and... And it was on sale with an additional 10% off with her discount. Well, put it behind the toaster. Okay. That's what I was gonna do. Hello, Clemence? This is Dr. Lismoen. Well, I just-- I-- I hope you're all right. Let me know when you'd like to reschedule. Okay, then. Goodbye. Hi, Clemence. I had us scheduled at 2:00 p.m. today. Call me back. Your book sounds promising. -This is so fucking weird. -It's gonna be chill. Like I said, my coworker is super mature and she's gonna be Jeff Bezos by the time I learn how to replace the paper towels. She got a 35, so... Well, that makes me feel like shit. Same. A high school party? Oh, my God. I know so many people here. -Kill me. -Kill you? How about kill to be you? God, I miss being relevant. These are the best years of your life. And the worst of mine. -How could you-- -Hi. We're Beth's friends. Co-- Colleagues. We're-- We're Beth's ex-colleagues. -Give him a beer. -No. Do it, bitch. Should I talk to that kid who asked us for a beer? Should I? I think I have health with him. Like sex ed? -Yeah. -I mean, that is hot. Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait. Dude, is this Clemence? -Yo, you came. -Oh, my God, Beth. Whoa. Carlin! Oh, you two are sisters. -Oh! -You two are the same age! Yeah, we have calc together, right? She actually, like, lent me her graphing calculator, which was super sweet of you. You're a really nice person. Carlin, I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've ever heard you talk. She talks all the time. She's so fucking annoying. Wait, wait, okay, guys, this is my boyfriend, and-- - What? - Oh, my God. -No, no. What are you-- -Oh, my God. Oh, okay. Uh, this is Kyle. That's our fucking brother! That little freshman shrimp kid over there. Neil! You can't be drinking. Are you that dumb? Why-- why are you here? Why can't you just leave him alone? Seriously? Who invited you guys? Who do you think bought that fancy-ass beer in your hand? Yeah, yeah, yeah, chill, kid. This is a senior party. You're lucky to be here. Seniors only, bitch. I don't know why they're even here, man. I-- I-- I don't know why they're here. Who will you challenge me to shotgun this beer? You? You will. A little-- little sword. All right. Oh, shit! Damn. That's hard to do. That's my sister. Clemence, she's-- she's crazy. Like, literally, she's crazy, babe. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. Hey, uh, you and your sister, you guys trying to turn up? What does that mean? - But yes. - He's here. You got cash? Yeah. So, like, I know how to smoke weed, but if someone could just hold the thing for me and cover up the hole and tell me when to inhale. Uh, weed? Yeah, you guys ever take Adderall before? Clemence? - Oh, no. - Who is that? He lives around here. So you're a drug dealer for high school kids? Uh, yeah. - What's your job? - She lost it. Oh, shit, she really did. - You did. - I did. -You're so mad at me. -Stop trying to talk. Well, what do you-- What do you want to do with your life, you know? Like, other than ruining other kids' lives? Something with, like, music. - Shut the fuck up. - What? What? That is embarrassing. Dude, it beats pissing away tuition money, I bet your parents love that. Dude... You should see my therapy bills. Like, shit's, like, $300 a session and my guy is a total clown. That is messed up, man. Damn! I mean, yeah, he's a clown, but he's also kind of fucking smart. -Sometimes. -Dope. -You should go. -Hell no. Yeah, no, I'm serious. Wait, stop. Stop it. I'm serious. I'm serious. -Dude, no. -You should go. -No. -You should go. -No-- -I'll give you my guy's email. -Dude, I-- nah-- -Dr. Madzen, yes! You're fucked up. Go to therapy. Just do it. Na-- No, because not everyone has money like that. And-- and it feels weird talking about that kind of stuff anyway, like, to a stranger. Fuck that. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but also, you're kind of damaged. -Yeah? -You're, like, fucked up. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, like, you're bad. You are bad. You made me do the drugs that caused my downfall. -Dude! -I didn't make you do anything. - Clemence. - You did, you made me. Clemence. It's time to go. - Let's go. - It's chilly. Now. -Wait, no. -No. My dad's here. -Gotta go. -Where are your clothes? Who cares? I'm gonna take this with me. We're leaving. Come on. All right, it's been a good time. Thank you. Honestly, we are lucky to be alive. -You're gonna freeze to death. -Whatever, nerd. You wouldn't last a day in high school, but I would... ...and I did. Yeah, you did. Oh, shit. No, no. They're gonna-- they're gonna breathalyze us. -We gotta run, come on. -No, we can't run, that's so obvious, dude. I got this. - Hey! - What's going on here? Not a lot. I'll have to speak to your parents, obviously. I must warn you, they're very boring people. - What is going on? Clemence? - Father? These three... individuals have been roaming the neighborhood. Mom, Dad, we're-- we're sorry-- I mean, well, I-- I'm sorry. I mean, I wasn't even supposed to hang out with them tonight, but I ended up taking care of their drunk asses, so-- Way to throw us under the fucking bus. - Okay, I'm not drunk. - Carlin, you're a mess. -Okay, shut up. -You gotta get it together. Dude, you're the one who fucked a drug dealer. I have cancer. Uh, we got it from here. Thank you. I shouldn't have waited, but I did. Why? It was a few months before, uh, Clemence came back. And, um, I, um-- I felt something. But I waited because-- I don't know. But then I finally went in and, uh... ...they-- they said I should go for it. What are you even saying? You're not saying any information, -you're just-- -They think that, uh, I should - nip it in the bud. - Wha-- like... cut them off? It's called a mastectomy, Clem. If it means I'm less likely to die then, yeah, I guess. So, there will be surgery and-- and then chemo and then... fingers crossed. The-- the real shame is that I've had to close the store. I mean, you'll still be beautiful, Mom. Why did you wait this long to tell us? What is wrong with you? There was never a good time. That's not a real excuse. All right, what's done is done. All right? But everything's gonna be fine. All right? And I've already been doing a lot of research and apparently beet juice can raise your white blood cell count. Do we think maybe this family is cursed? - Dude, shut up. - Clem, enough. There is a restaurant-grade juicer behind the toaster, so... That's really sweet, Dad. ♪ There's got to be a morning after ♪ ♪ If we can hold on through the night.. ♪ Hey, be gentle with that. -It's a family heirloom. -Whoa, what are you doing here? - Well, I-- - Also, I heard you got arrested -after the party? -Really? - Keep circulating that. - Hey, what's, uh, what's going on over here-- Clemence-- Um, call security. -We don't have security. -Yeah, well, we should. Ricky, I need you to take me back. Uh... I'll do better, I promise. No, you were caught stealing, so-- Okay, but it's not about me, okay? Fuck. My mom has cancer. And, uh, I'm an asset. Even ask Mikael. After all I've done for you? I'm sorry, Clemence, but we already hired Lisa. Oh, okay. So you just-- you just use the college dropouts and then toss us back into the gutter? Well, "Lisa," I hope you're a perfect, devout Christian, because that is the only way that you will make it in this cutthroat industry. Uh, guys, I-- I heard back from Western. I mean, it's not my-- my top choice, obviously, but, uh, it's first acceptance. - Nice. - Western, Illinois? Yeah. You know that shit hole ruined my life, right? I-- I don't... I mean, this isn't about you at all, Clemence. Believe it or not. I actually thought you'd-- Wait, what? What did you think? I-- I thought that-- I thought you-- You-- you-- you thought I might be what? Like, proud? Like, you thought maybe I'd give you, like, a little gold star on your-- on your spreadsheet -of accomplishments? -What's your problem? Why don't you go back to texting your stupid ass friends about how much we embarrass you? Just, yeah, call-- call up swimmer Kyle and-- and cry about how hard your life is. Right, sorry, - 'cause your life is so hard? - Yeah. -Yeah. Do you have cancer? -Don't even-- don't-- -My mental illness-- -Are you dying, Clemence? Because Mom might be. And you're just-- you're making it so much harder... for all of us, so, thank you. Fine. Welcome back. I didn't really have a choice. Something's wrong. Have you been taking your medications, Clemence? That's the thing. I, uh... missed a few doses, and then I... took some, uh, other-- other stuff and... some study drugs and... and I, uh, just got really fucked up. And since then it's all been harder. You have to work at this. You have to. This is never going to go away. And, uh, my mom's, like, dying. So... Yeah, well-- I'm very sorry. Yeah. Me, too. You-- you know, Clemence, for some patients, I do a sliding scale. The work is pro bono, free of charge. I-- I could do that for you and it would include the past weeks. -Everything. -Am I stuck here? - What? - You know? I... -That's up to you. -I thought I was getting better. I was doing it, and-- I was. And you have to keep doing it. It's never done. This is life now, Clemence. Be diligent. Can you hurry up? I'm taking a shit. - What's going on? - She's been in there for, - like, 20 minutes. - Yeah, she has. Clemence. Open the door. Come on, Clemence, what's going on in there? - Leave me the fuck alone! - Clemence! Oh, my God. No, spit that out, spit that out. Come on. Cough it out, come on. - Get out! Hey! Don't. No! God damn it! Oh, my God. Oh! Shit! Oh, my God. - Ow. - Clemence? Bring her right in here. - Dad, move! - Dad get-- Dad, get up! - Go! - Here, here, put her right here. -Right here. -Oh, shit. - Oh, my God. - Oh, dear. Here, here, here, here. Oh, my God. Should we call 911? - Mom, she's fine. - Clemence, hello? Can you hear us? - Oh, what happened? - Well, basically, you were trying to kill yourself, I think. I don't know what the hell you were doing. And then it-- it got-- it got physical. It was a joke. It was funny! - It wasn't. - Yeah, no. Well, you bonked your head, huh? Why should I fight every day if you're not even gonna try? I mean, it's not fair, Clemence. I'm the one that's gonna have surgery and have to do chemo -and lose all my hair-- -You did this to me. You fucking made me this way! - Wow... - Yeah. See you later. Well, technically, I also made you this way. Ew. - Need help up? - Give me my shoe. - Okay. - Oh, my God. - There you go. Wow. - All right, whatever. Forget it. It's for nothing. Yo, sophomore year is gonna be such a bitch. Yo. Is-- is that-- Hold up. Yo. -Ashik. -Oh, yo. So, I haven't heard from your sister in a little bit and, uh, is everything okay? Yeah, um, I guess she just took some prescription pills that mess with her medication. Uh, just made her really sick. Oh, shit. When you see her, tell her I said... "Hi." Uh, no. No, I don't-- I don't think I will. Okay. Who would ever want to buy this, Dad? -Why? -I'm sure she had a vision. Okay, well, was she not wearing her glasses? All right. Your mom is complex, guys. She's an artist. Give her some credit. How long is it gonna be? 'Til she can, like, get up and do things again? I'm not sure. But when she does rise again, we will be ready. Hello? Hello? -Oh. Hey. -Hey. Oh, we're closed. Okay, can I come inside, though? I, uh, I just-- I-- I brought these. For your mom. Yeah, I felt bad, so... Okay. Um, well, she's not here. Uh, she's, uh, taking some time to chill before her mastectomy. Okay. Oh, well, okay. What-- whatever, then. Yep. Do you wanna get lunch anyway? Yeah. I'm pretty sure Mom is still mad at me over the pills thing. I mean, like, I don't know, she's totally ignoring me. She's just sick and tired. Always mad at you. Okay, Mom really needs our support right now, okay? So let's just-- you know, get in there, send her off with a bang, and we'll get through this, all right? Then maybe we can grill later. -Uh, I have plans, so... -Come on, dude. Okay, sorry. There she is! Miss America. Aw. -How you doing, sweetie? -I'm okay. I just want to get this thing over with, you know? I know. You look great. - Yeah. - It's gonna be great. - Okay. - Hi, Mom. - Hey! Ah! - Presents for you. That's great. That looks familiar. Well, it's from the store. Could you tell? Come here, sweetie. Thank you. Thanks, kid. Clemence has something for you, too. You know what? -We'll come back. Come on. -Okay. Oh. Just-- nowhere to go-- How is it going? Not great. Yeah. I'm kinda... I'm kinda mad at you. Oh, really? Yeah, uh, so... You're doing this, which is cool. Uh, then you're gonna do chemo and... everything and I... guess I'm just wondering... ...who's gonna take care of us if you die? Well, I think you would take care of yourself. And I think you-- you'd be great. Oh. I love you. Yeah, you're my special girl. -I have a present for you. -You do? Well, let's see it. It's a card. I made it. Don't even read it. Don't read it? I like it. Um, it's, like, a... yeah, it has a thing in it and you can put-- you put something in there and-- It's very, uh-- it's a very practical gift and I like it. -Yeah. -I like the color. One-- one other thing, too. Um... Welcome, everyone, to another session. And today, let's all send positive vibes out to Sherri - before her big surgery. - Oh, my God. How did you do that? Um, I wrote her, like, 25 emails. -Oh, my God. Oh, I love it. -Yeah. She was supposed to give me a shout-out, but apparently I'm not... Well, I think it's fantastic. I love it. You did good. That's great. - We didn't go anywhere. - Good. - Don't make it weird. - You guys, I'm famous. I'm on YouTube now. I'm, uh-- I'm going viral. - No. - Well, I might! -Yeah. -Wasn't that something? That is really something. - Isn't that something? - I-- I-- I-- oughta be signing-- -She's on YouTube. -autographs in the hospital. She's made it. Look, I actually don't think I even want to go to college. You don't go to college, you're an idiot, 'cause... it's what you've always wanted. So you should at least try it out. And, anyway, you can't-- you can't make a decision like this just 'cause some burnout is haunting you. I mean, there's one haunting me, sexually. I really thought that I wanted to be a doctor, but I think... I just wanted to be not you. I'm sorry about that. Didn't you make that for me? -What? -I think it's, like, supposed to be Indiana. I don't know. I don't remember. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I did. I-- I did make that. I painted it. I kinda like it. I might-- I might take it with me. -Really? -Yeah. Would it be random if you, like, did become a doctor or a scientist or some shit and you, like, found the cures for me and Mom? I'm not smart enough. Probably not. But if any of us is, it's you. Um, I'm gonna watch The Matrix, so... Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. I feel like all of this is just too much work. I'm so tired of it never actually getting better. Isn't it better, though? You know, I'm not a cure, but a treatment. Not the best, not perfect, but better. - Oh, yes! - I guess. I love it! This customer today would not stop staring. It was so goddamn rude. I wanted to be like, "Can I get you some popcorn for the show?" But I didn't. You should have. People are gonna ask you why you're bald. You just gotta tell 'em you have cancer and make them feel bad about it. Hmm, that's a good idea. - Yeah. - Mailman! Oh, uh, this one I found in the cabinet. Don't know how it got there. Ricky, we're enemies now. What do you want? Hi, Clemence. Well, hi, uh, we have a sudden opening because... Beth is no longer with us. She-- she-- she is alive, she's just-- I guess it just wasn't fun anymore since you-- Well, anyway. Oh, oh, hey, how's your mom? Uh, dead, actually, but thanks. Hey! Hey, I'm leaving. Leaving town. Like, soon. What about-- um, what about your mom? Uh, she'll be okay. She's a tough bitch. Had a tumor in her boob and still knocked me the hell out. Right, yeah. Well, um... Don't-- don't do any-- don't do anything crazy out there, you know? Do you even know me? Kind of. I really don't want to do this meeting. I-- I don't want to do it. I mean, you have to face it eventually. Just pretend you're talking to one of your doctors and you're having a heart-to-heart. Okay, cool. How about everyone keeps their sage advice to themselves? You know? Today is about me. Every day is about you. You dragged your dying mother two hours away, you're going in. Please, you are not dying. Do you want us to come in with you, honey? Yeah, 'cause that wouldn't be weird as hell. Okay. Okay. All right. Good lu-- mm. So, I'm, uh, pretty thirsty. Sorry, I just thought I'd-- Oh, no, it's-- it's no problem. We actually typically don't have parents in these meetings. Oh, no, it's cool, this is, like, a thing that we do. Oh-- Great. So-- so, yeah, um, just, uh, wondering what my options are. Um, I'm not here to, like, commit to anything, so just... ...chill on that, but I, uh-- I'd like to know where I stand. And for you to stop sending mail to my house. Uh, well... you haven't been formally withdrawn from the school. You were put on a student hiatus 'til next fall. What? I just had a feeling you might-- Oh, wow. I feel violated a little bit. I need more storage space in the basement. You know, this is your decision, Clemence. The door is open, just let us know. The sooner the better. I-- I haven't even picked a major yet. She's very creative. Much more than my other kids. Well, good job, you know? Either way. Oh, hey, uh, can you just wait for me in the car actually, wait-- -Yeah, great, just-- -Uh, tell them that-- -I'll tell them, you know-- -Please. Just, uh, here, take this. -Thank you. -Okay. I don't even want to know. Hey, Eliza. It's Clemence. Probably the only Clemence you've ever known. How have you been? Okay.
