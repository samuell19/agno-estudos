No! My baby! The baby... Something's... Something's wrong with the baby. The baby's fine. Don't worry about the baby. Mia. Mia? Mia? Mia? Mia! Oh. Sweetie. Oh, I'm sorry. Mommy didn't mean to scare you. - Mommy scare me. - Mommy just had a bad dream. I love you, Mommy. I love you too. Okay, let's get you back into your bed, okay? I don't want to be alone. You wanna sleep with Mommy tonight? - That sound good? - Yes. Come over here, sweet girl. Do you want more? Good job! Got it? Oh, nice! Is it better to eat one at a time, I think? A lot easier, right? Can you eat two more for Mommy? Good girl. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Dripping all over. Are you slurping, silly girl? You're getting so big, aren't you? You're big. You're a big girl now, huh? There's a peach. There's a peach. You're right. Mommy loves you, Mia. Come here. Put that down. Up with Mommy. Hello, Daniel. Hello, Rachel. How you doing? Fine. Listen, you have a minute to talk? Sure, go ahead. I don't know how to say this, so I'm just... I'm gonna say it. Rachel, ever since our separation, I'm having a really hard time paying the bills. I mean, between the mortgage payment, the credit cards, the cars, you name it. I don't know if you noticed, but the city's placed us on furlough, and I... I'm just in way over my head, and I can't... I just can't keep paying for everything. You're a lawyer, Daniel. You can handle our living expenses. I'm a city attorney, Rache. I don't make the kind of money other lawyers do. You know that. What about the money that we've been saving for the past five years? I've been plowing through it just to stay afloat. That's really unfortunate, Daniel. The worst part of it is... if things don't get better, I'm gonna lose the house. You mean, I'm gonna lose the house. You can look at it however you want to. How else am I supposed to look at it? I don't know, Rachel, but I'm gonna have to pull back on the money I've been giving you and Mia. I just don't see any other way around it. I'm sorry. So am I. You seem to take really good care of yourself, Daniel. Have you even once considered Mia? Of course I have! How could you even say that? Because it's true. You hardly ever see her. As soon as I have enough money, I'm gonna finalize this divorce, and I'm gonna demand enough alimony and child support to take care of us. You can live in a studio apartment for all I care. I'm not the one that wanted to get separated. You cheated on me. I know. I know I did. I'm not perfect. Rachel... I know I made a huge mistake. I wanna go to counseling. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. And to think that I actually loved you. You still love me, Rache. No, I don't. Don't flatter yourself. I still love you. No, you don't. No, you don't. You just can't stand to lose something you thought you had. Well, you screwed up, Daniel. At least one of us is happy. - Hey, Mia, who's that? - Me! That's you! - Do you like the picture? - Yeah. Oh, you're gonna draw too? Thank you. I know. You're not tired, but it's bedtime, okay? It's time to go night-night. It is a big blanket for you, but it's bedtime, sweetheart. Okay? Look outside, look outside for me. Can you see? ♪ Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪ Dinner is served! I just put Mia down. I am so sorry. It's Brock's fault. Come in. Yeah, come in. - It's so good to see you. - You too, sweetie. - And he falls right over. - What? You okay? Yeah, I'm good. No, you're not. I'm good. What's not to be good about? You are lying. I always knew you were psychic. No, I just know you better than you know yourself. She says that very same thing to me. So what's going on? Daniel called this morning, and, um, he's having some financial problems. He's gonna be cutting the allowance for Mia and I, and turns out we might lose the house. What? How can he do that? Oh, no. I can't believe that. Why? How can that be? I don't know, but it's happening. Well, he's lying. Do you know if he's dating anyone? No. I don't know, but I don't care. I just, um... Because we're not gonna be getting any more child support, I'm gonna have to go back to work, which means I have to put Mia in daycare. - Really? - Yeah. But I thought you swore you wouldn't do it. I did, I know, but I don't have a choice. - I have to go back to work. - Why don't you hire a nanny? No. That would be a nightmare. Well, you know how I feel about daycare. I think we need to socialize our kids. They need to find their independence. And virtually every study says that daycare is beneficial to a child's growth. Little Ones Daycare, it's a wonderful place. Seriously, I always felt like the kids were so safe. And they were happy. Barbara, the director, she really knows how to keep those kids busy all day long. And they were just so well-adjusted by the time we got them from preschool to kindergarten. Okay, how about if I take you there tomorrow and introduce you to everyone? Now that is a good idea. You have time to do that? For you? And for my goddaughter? Of course I do. Okay. Uh, yeah. Okay, I'll do it, but, you know, no commitments. Just to look at it. Rachel, what a surprise. Hey, Martin. Uh, I'm coming back. Got any room for a starving artist? There's always room for you. There's a case starting tomorrow morning. You can jump on that. Yeah. That would be great. Okay, I'll see you then. See you then. Bye. Hey, girl. Come give your auntie a hug. Hi, sweetie. - I love you. - Oh, my gosh. - So this is Rachel. - Hi. As you know, both of Melissa's kids graduated from here at Little Ones. In fact, Barbara was their teacher before she became the school director. I was. Okay, the classroom is just right around this corner. Oh, great. Right this way. Now we flip it over. There's a picture here too! Look at that! All right. We're gonna do this. It's gonna look fantastic. I know we call it a daycare, but it's really a preschool. I mean, we are not babysitters. Our purpose is to make sure that they're enriched every moment that they're here. Wow. It's really, it's really impressive. I mean, the kids all look so happy. I don't think I've heard one cry yet. Oh, no, no, no. That does happen. But they're usually pretty happy little busy bees. But when they're not playing or eating or napping, they're preparing for the next phase of their life. This is Miss Wright. She's been with us for three years. This is Rachel, and this is Mia. Oh, hi. She's thinking about bringing Mia here to Little Ones. Oh. You look familiar. Have we met before? I don't think so. Maybe we've just seen each other around. Maybe the market or salon or something? Yeah, I'm sure we've crossed paths at some point. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Miss Wright, we need you. Oh, well, I should go. But it was very nice to meet you, uh... Mia. Mia. That's a very pretty name. All right, guys, thanks. Let's see what you guys are doing over here. Are you playing with Play-Doh? That's pretty cool. We even have a bigger playground in the back. Oh, wow. Your place is so warm and pretty. Oh my gosh, you have a vegetable garden with real vegetables. Okay, I have to confess. My husband, he's the one with the green thumb. He's here every weekend planting something. And if he's not planting something, he's building a new fence, he's putting together a new toy, or he's painting a mural on a wall. Wow. This place is amazing. What do you do if there's a problem or an emergency? All of our teachers are fully trained in first-aid, but if anything happens, we'll call you or your husband right away. Oh, we're not together anymore, but, um... He's around. I'm the point person. Okay. I understand. Look... it's our job to support you, make your life easier. So? Listen, You don't have to make a decision today. Take your time. Just bring Mia by when you're ready, and we'll sign her up. Okay, good. It was so great to meet you. Nice to meet you. And it was great meeting you too. See you later. Bye-bye. I gotta run, but just give me a call anytime. - Thank you. - Bye, honey. Okay. Barbara! It's a no-brainer. Little Ones is perfect for Mia. Great. You won't regret it and neither will Mia. We know. What do you say we go get her comfortable? Okay. Come on. I'm really happy that you decided that Little Ones was the home for Mia. And, please, call me Gabby. Oh, okay, so this is Miss Gabby. Okay? Can you say Gabby? - Gabby. - Oh, good job. I have to be admit, I'm a little nervous to leave her with a stranger. I mean, I've left her with people she didn't know before, but this is different. Oh, no, no, but we're not strangers. Are we? - No. - Aw, come here. I'm gonna make sure that you are the happiest little girl in the whole world. She likes you. I like her very much. Hey, how about I introduce you to some of your toys? And then you can meet some new friends once they get back from recess. Look at our cool castle. She's gonna be fine. I have an idea. Why don't you come with me back to the office, fill out some paperwork, and then we'll come back in like 15 minutes and check on her, okay? Okay. That's a really good idea. Okay. Hey, Mia. Hi, sweetie. Okay, Mommy's gonna be gone for just a couple of minutes, okay? If you need anything, you talk to Miss Gabby, okay? - You gonna be okay? - Yes. Thank you. I know that this is my job, but these kids are my life. They make me whole. So here's the Little Ones contract. Nothing shocking. Just your information, month-to-month pay, release of liability, etc. Wow. You sure have this place covered in cameras. Yes... As a matter of fact, you can log in to the school website and view any of the cameras remotely. I don't know, I just thought it would give the families an extra feeling of comfort. - So what do you do for work? - I'm a courtroom artist. I'm the one who gives the visual when cameras aren't allowed. Did you go to art school? I got my undergrad at UCLA and then my MFA at Art Center and then I did go on... Mia. Is that Mia? Mia! Mia? Oh, no, this is Angela, and her mother just dropped her off. She'll be okay in a couple of minutes. You looking for Mia? Mia's in the other room. She's just playing with the other kids. Mia, your mommy's here. See? No worries. She's adjusting just fine. Okay, sweetie, Mommy's gonna have to leave right now, okay? But if you need anything, anything at all, you say something to Miss Gabby, okay? - I love you. - I love you too. Don't worry, Rachel. We're gonna take very good care of her. Thanks, Gabby. I appreciate it. Come here, Mia. Thank you. We'll see you in a few hours, okay? It's gonna be all right. Rachel! It's good to see you. We missed you. So you got kicked out of the courtroom? Unfortunately, yes. We're depending on you now. Well, I was looking over the briefing and the sketches, and it looks like it's gonna be a long one. You'll have plenty of sketches. Can't wait to start airing them on the 5:00 news. Find me when you've got me. I'll be around. - Sure. - Oh, and, Rachel, you know that Daniel's the lead prosecution attorney. You could've told me that last night. Thought you might not want the gig. Yeah, you're probably right. All rise for the Honorable Judge Joyner. Good morning. As you all know, we're here today to listen to the case of the State of California vs. Richard D. Fowler, who is charged with the murder of Cynthia Fowler. The baby! Something's wrong... Ladies and gentlemen, before I begin, I'd like to thank our jury for their service. - The baby. - The baby's fine. No, I think something's wrong with the baby. The baby's fine. The baby's fine. - It's not fine. - Are you okay? ...on the evidence as presented in the trial. The opening and closing arguments of the lawyers are not evidence. Do you have a question for me, Mr. Stevens? Proceed the bench, Mr. Stevens. Where did you go, Mia? Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we will have to take a brief recess. We will adjourn in 15. Hi, Barbara. It's Rachel. I'm so sorry to call, but I logged onto the Little Ones website, and I'm looking at the camera feed, and I don't see Mia. That's odd because I see her clearly here. If you log on again, you should see her now. Oh. I see her. Thanks. I'm sorry. It's okay. Unfortunately, the cameras don't cover every area of the room. To be honest, I was a little hesitant about the cameras for this very reason. Everything okay? Uh, yeah, that's okay. You know what? It's day one. I'm sure that my fears will dissipate after a few years. Don't worry. You can call me anytime. Okay. Thanks, Barbara. I'll be there to pick her up in two hours. Okay, bye. Everything okay? I saw you run out. Don't you need to be in the courtroom? The judge is just working out some scheduling issues. Nothing my assistant can't handle. So you're okay? Yeah. Uh... It's Mia's first day in daycare, so I'm on pins and needles. Yeah, I can tell. If you want to, I can take you to your favorite restaurant during the lunch break. Really, Daniel? It's Mia's first day at daycare, and you want to go rekindle an old flame that died a long time ago. Don't be so sensitive. I was just asking you out to lunch. I have to go, um, do a sketch. Okay. If both the prosecution and the defense are satisfied with the schedules going forward, I'd like to begin with the opening statement from the prosecution. Thank you, Your Honor. Wow. You made it all the way to work and back in three hours. Is it all right if I pick my baby up? Of course. You can get her anytime you need. Just be sure and let Gabby know when you sign her out. Thank you. All right, bye. Rachel. - Oh. Hi, Gabby. - Hi. - So how did she do today? - She was fantastic. You and Mr. Miller must be very good parents. Well, actually, it's mostly me. He and I aren't together anymore. Oh, really? That's unfortunate. I'm so sorry. A child really needs both of her parents. Well, he's around and just... Studies actually show that children who have both parents do better in their reading and math scores and overall just socialize better. Well, that's not happening anytime soon. Oh. Life has a way of taking us on a path we don't expect. I hear ya. - I'm gonna go pick up Mia. - Okay. Oh, you know something, I just realized, I was commenting on your personal life. I didn't mean that. Oh, that's okay. Um, you know what? I figure we'll get really close in these next couple months, and we might as well start now. Okay. I'd like that, yeah. Mia, sweetie! - Did you have fun? - Yes. Oh, good. Come on. I'm so glad. I'm so glad. - Thank you. - No problem. Seems like she had a great time. Thank you for bringing such a cute little girl to our daycare. All right, let's go. It was her. What? I know it was her. How can you know that for sure? Because, Troy, I can never forget a face. She was covered in blood. You had a concussion. Her face... is etched in my memory. Her face haunts my dreams. I can't get that night out of my head, and all I want to do is forget about it. It's okay, honey. Daddy just needs to stretch his legs a little bit. Show me how your game works, Crystal. I can't do it. You can. You can do it. Nnnnrrr! Nnnnrrr! I need to make it like Miss Leo. Hey, can you guys help us out? We've been driving around in circles. We're lost. That is quite obvious. You know how to get to the 385 from here? I'm not really from around here. I drive through here all the time, but I'm not quite sure. I think you can keep going west on this road and you'll hit it. Actually, you know what? It might be east. I'll just ask my wife. She'll know. No, it's all good, man. Thank you. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Thank you. Don't you have a GPS in this car? No? It's not worth fighting over. Have a good one. Wow. That guy's seriously stressed out. Why don't you go back to Hollywood?! Sorry, babe. Some people just don't appreciate you. I tried to help. I tried. - Get in the car. - Okay. I love you. I love you too. - What's that guy doing? - What? Those lights. They look like they're coming straight for us. Troy, Troy, swerve to the right. Gabby, we're gonna get hit! Troy, swerve to the right! No! Oh, God! Rachel! Rachel! Are you all right? Are you okay? Are you all right? - The baby... - The baby's fine. I know something's wrong with the baby. - Don't worry about the baby. Are you okay? - I don't know! - Are you all right? - My feet... - Are you okay? Gabby, Crystal... Crystal, Mommy's coming. Baby? We're okay, we're okay. Okay. Ohhh... No! No! No! No! No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No! I looked in her eyes. We connected. And I saw Crystal. Our baby was there. God has a plan for us. She's gonna be ours soon. Gabby... what are you talking about? What, do you think this was some sort of coincidence that Rachel brought her child into my classroom? That's not a coincidence. Gabby, that wasn't Crystal. Crystal's dead. No. No, I saw Crystal. I was with Crystal. Oh, Gabby, please. Please just get yourself together, okay? It was just a coincidence. That's all. Sweetie? Dig deep with me. Think about this. God gave us a second chance here. He's done the work, and now we have to do the rest of it. Baby, we can be whole again. No. No, we can't be whole. Gabby, I'm paralyzed. I'm never gonna be able to walk again. You have no idea what it's like. Not what I meant. That's not what I meant. I meant... I meant that we could be a family again. I meant that we can move on with our lives from... this. I care about Crystal. I care about her so much. I want this. Give me this. Then we'll just go pick her up and take her home tomorrow. Don't be stupid. It's too easy. No one can suspect anything. We're gonna be raising a little girl. We can't be running from the law for the rest of our lives. No, Mia and I need to spend some time together, and I need to get to know her, and she... She needs to love me. She's three years old. Give her a teddy bear. She'll love that. Tell her that's her mother. Don't say that. She's a human being. She's smart. What about her mother? She recognize you? No. She didn't recognize me because we're nothing to her. She didn't care about Crystal then, and she doesn't care about her now. What about him? They're divorced. He's just around Mia when it's convenient for him, so... Look, he's a bad father. You're gonna be a good father. God chose you. Come here. Come here. Baby, this is our second chance. Can't you see that? I'm sorry, baby, with all my heart. We were dealt a really bad hand, weren't we? Well, yeah, we were. But this is the way to make it right. I love you. I'll do anything for us to be a family again. You know that, right? Yeah, I know that, and I love you too. Okay, so today Mommy's gonna be gone a little bit longer than I was before, okay? The day was fun. Oh, good. And do you like your teachers? - I like Miss Becca. - Do you like Miss Gabby? - Yes. - Yeah? - Hi. - Oh, hi. Hi, Mia. She had a really great time yesterday. And you're gonna have fun again today too. Mommy, not go. What's wrong, honey? Mommy, no work. I know. Mommy has to work. Okay, I'm gonna give you guys a second. Bring her in when you're ready. - I have to get the kids started on another activity. - Okay. Sweetie, listen, Mommy has to work, okay? How about this? How about when I pick you up today, I take you to the pier, and we go get ice cream? Does that sound like fun? Sounds good. - Ready? - Yeah. We're gonna have a blast! Okay. Uh... Come on, let's have a good day. Bye, sweetie. Mr. Fowler, would you be so kind as to describe your upbringing? Objection, Your Honor. The jury does not need to hear about Mr. Fowler's family history. It's an unnecessary drama used specifically to pull at the heartstrings of the jury. Mr. Fowler's childhood is not necessary in this case. No need to waste court time on an overwrought narrative. Objection denied. You may answer the question, Mr. Fowler. Sure. Well, my parents were very poor. When I was born, we lived on a farm with no power. Okay, guys, here you go. What color crayon do you want? I want purple. The purple? Here you go. Good job. Okay, kids, now we are all gonna hand in our pictures when we're done, and I'm gonna give you stickers for it. No, I don't want to. You need to learn to follow directions. Your assignment was to draw a picture of you and me living together in a house, not a horsey. Rebecca, could you please get some popsicle sticks from room 403? Tell Mrs. Choi that we will get her back. Sure, Miss Wright. No daughter of mine is going to disobey me. Do you understand? Look at me. You need to understand. I love you more than your birth parents, okay? And someday soon your name's gonna be Crystal. Do you like that name? Do you like Crystal? - Say "Crystal." - Crystal. Okay, good. Let's go back to the kids, and I'll give you a treat if you're good. Okay. I wanna make one more picture. Oh, good, okay! Well, then you should definitely make one. You gonna be good now, Crystal? Here you go, sweetie. Good job, guys. Very proud. ♪♪ You need to understand that that was not good, okay? Not good. You don't do that again. Don't let me catch you doing that again. Is everything okay? Yes. Um, well, no. Mia and I were just having a bit of a talk about sharing. She took another child's toy, and we needed to have a discussion about it, so... - You did? - No like school. Well, is everything okay? Yeah. No, no, everything's fine now. Okay. I'm gonna sign Mia out. See you tomorrow, Mia. I might be out of place here, but what's up with you and that child? What are you talking about? I'm her teacher too. I should know what's going on. You're not her teacher. You work for me. Where's your master's in child development? Where's yours? I hear you talk about all of your education successes, yet I've never seen any proof of them. Ask me one more question, you're fired. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit a nerve like that. You did. - Is everything okay? - Oh, yeah, it's fine. We just had a bad day today. We'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Hi. Do you mind if I talk to you about something? Do that, babe. Ouch. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. Did Mommy hurt you? Yeah. What happened? How did you do... Mia, listen to Mommy. How did you do this? Can you tell Mommy what happened? - Gabby. - Something happened with Gabby? Did you fall? You fell. Okay, well, I'm glad that Gabby was there to help you. Mommy's gonna have to talk to Gabby. Well, do you remember who's coming for dinner? - Yeah. - Who? - Daddy. - Daddy! Daddy's coming for dinner. And you know what? He's gonna kiss those boo-boos, and he's gonna make it all better. How does that sound? - Good. - Good! Okay, let's go see who that is. Come here, sweetie. Okay. Who is it? It's Gabby Wright. - Hi. - Hi, Gabby. What are you doing here? I'm so sorry to intrude. I was in the area, and Mia left this at school, so I thought I'd return it personally. Thank you. Yeah. Are you gonna invite me in? Oh, please, come in. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's okay. Hey, little one. Oh, she's tired. It's a long time to be at daycare. Oh, my God, your house is beautiful. Um... I don't think that this is Mia's jacket. How long have you lived here? Five years. Daniel and I bought it right after we got married. That's sad. What is? Oh, I mean that you're divorced. I mean, with a house like this, you're gonna want to raise a family. Hey, Mia, I'm sure you want some brothers and sisters, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'm sure she does. - What are you cooking? - It smells amazing. - Uh... Gabby, this isn't Mia's jacket. Oh, I could've sworn that I saw her wearing that this morning. It's like the size of a third grader. You know, if the mommies just labeled their kids clothing, I wouldn't have to be running around and returning things. Um, doesn't the school have a lost and found? Mmm! I'm really happy that you came by because I was dressing Mia earlier, and I noticed bruises all over her arms. Oh. Do you know anything about that? Oh. Barbara didn't talk to you? - No. - Yeah, no. That's strange because I told her to let you know that Angela, the little girl that cries too much, she's really rough with the other kids. Angela did that? Yeah. She's got two older brothers, and she's just used to roughhousing. I guess that makes sense. Oh, are you expecting someone else for dinner? My husband. Oh, your husband. Daddy! Hey, there's my little girl! Be careful. She has bruises on her arm. - You got some bruises? - Yes. Yeah. She'll be fine. Well, thanks for the invite, girls. - Hello. - Hi. Oh, this is Gabby. She's Mia's daycare teacher. You must be Mr. Miller. You know, I've heard a lot about you. I've even seen you on the news. You're a city attorney, right? I am. That's a thankless job. But I mean, you know, it takes someone very special to do that. Oh, thank you, Gabby. Hey, have we met before? You know, I said the same thing about your wife. She must have one of those faces. Yeah, that must be it. - Is that it? - Yes. Thank you, Gabby, for coming by and dropping off the sweater. Um, oh, I... I just thought I was staying for dinner. I didn't invite you. Oh, um, okay. I'm just gonna head out. Uh, Gabby. Thank you for everything that you've been doing for Mia. We really appreciate it. Oh, it's no problem. It's my pleasure. I love all my kids, but Mia here is extra special. I gotta go somewhere anyways, so it's probably best that I'm not staying for dinner. All right, I'll see you guys later. - Okay. - Bye, Mia. - What was that? - That was creepy. So that's her daycare teacher? Yeah. Come on. Okay, let's go get some dinner. What are you gonna make me? Ducks? Really? You have a good day at school? Yes, good. So what do you think about scheduling a meeting with Barbara? She's the director at Mia's daycare, and I just think we should talk to her about the bruises on her arm, you know? And Gabby's intrusion was weird. Well, what if Gabby's the one causing the bruises? What if Gabby's abusing our child? No, that's not possible. I mean, there's cameras in every room. And there's an assistant with her at all times. Listen, this stuff does happen, you know? Don't be so naïve. What? I'm not naïve. I know, I know. That's why I married you. Right? - Yeah. - Yes. Maybe we should make these Wednesday night things a regular thing? Ooh, I like that. I think that it would be really good for Mia. I would like that. Are you okay? No. Rebecca didn't show up for work today. That is just not like her. I mean, she never misses work. If something's wrong, she always calls me. And her phone just keeps going straight to voicemail. Well, you know what? I'm sure she's fine. She's a smart girl. I don't know. I'm worried. Does that mean that there won't be another teacher in the room today? I don't have anyone else. I would really like it if you would periodically check in on Gabby. That's a lot of work for one person. Of course I will. Of course. Thanks. I really don't mean to bother you, but I would really like to have a meeting with you. Anything wrong? I don't want to bother you about it today. Just at some point. Okay. Anytime tomorrow should be fine. I'm sure that we'll know where Rebecca is then. Sharks. Did you know they have poor eyesight? They can't really see in the front of their eyes. I didn't know that. They have to rely on smell. - Look. - School. Oh, look who it is, guys. Stay here, stay here. Hi! Are Mia's bruises getting better? They are. Thanks. I called Angela's parents. I told them about inappropriate behavior, and it's not happening again. Oh, you didn't have to do that. No, I did. I definitely did because no one hurts Mia and gets away with it. Uh... Okay, I have to be downtown. Will you call me if anything else happens? - Of course. - Okay. But nothing will. It'll all be okay. All right, let's go play. You wanna sit right next to Mia? Okay, here. You can sit there. I know. And do you know what they eat? Mice. No, that's not what they eat. You look familiar. Have we met before? Mia. That's a very pretty name. Is everything okay? No. No, it's Rebecca. What? What happened? They found Rebecca. What? What happened? She was hit by a car. It was a hit-and-run. They said that the driver just sped off and left her in the street. Is she all right? They aren't sure. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. You know, she was just such a sweet girl. I mean, the thought of her being in pain is just... so upsetting. Did Rebecca have any relationship issues, enemies, anybody that didn't like her? I don't know. Why? Because we have reason to believe that this was not an accident. Oh, my God. How? Witnesses said that they saw the driver of the vehicle heading straight for her. That is terrible. No, no, she's a nice girl. She comes from a nice family. There were no issues. She never missed a day of work. Do you know what kind of car it was? Unfortunately, the streetlights were very dim. All we have so far was that it was a late model dark-colored sedan, no license plate. One of the witnesses did say that they saw something hanging from the rearview mirror. Something like a handicap placard. Wow. Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Mia. I'll be back to check on you. I'm okay. I'm gonna go to the hospital and see Rebecca. We thank you for your help, and we're very sorry. - Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you. All right, guys, today we're gonna talk about photosynthesis. Can you all say photosynthesis? - Photo-syn-this! - Syn-the-tha! Good job. Okay, so this is a plant. I know you guys all like plants, right? Okay, guys, just sit here for a second, okay? I'll be right back. - Hi. - Hi. I was just teaching the kids about photosynthesis. How are you doing? Huh? What? Have you not heard the news about Rebecca? Oh, yeah. Just terrible. Terrible. But between you and me, she wasn't a very good assistant. She didn't have those motherly instincts, like you and I do. I didn't know that you were a mother. I'm not, but, you know, when the mommies are at work, I'm their mommy. And Rebecca, she just... She didn't really embrace that part of the job, so... Okay, Gabby, you know she might die. That's not what I heard. Oh, no, no, no. I heard that she's just, you know, she's gonna be in the hospital for a couple months. I actually think the time off will be really good for her. Yeah, well, we'll pray for her speedy recovery. Yes, me and Troy will definitely do that tonight. - Who's Troy? - I haven't told you about Troy? - He's my husband. - Oh. I've just never even heard you talk about it. Him or... Well, you know, he's handicapped, so... - Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. - He doesn't get out much. No, it's okay, you know, he's learned to deal with it. I'd better get Mia home. You know, maybe we can get lunch later this week and get to know each other a little better. I would love that. I would love that. That'd be great. Mia, sweetie, hi. Okay. All right, say bye. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. I saw you learning about photosynthesis and everything. I love that she taught you about that. All right. Here we go. Watch your head. How was daycare today? Miss Gabby made me treats. - Oh, she did? - Yup. - No hurt today? - No hurt. That's good. Oh. Hello, Daniel. - Hey. Everything all right? - Sure. There's just something about Mia's daycare. It's those damn video cameras. Every time I see Gabby take Mia to the corner of the room, I just get freaked out. I can understand that. She's fine though. She's with me right now. She said it was a good day. No problems in school, although... one of the teacher's assistants was in a car accident, and the police said that she was run over and... - And what? - And that it might have been intentional. That's frightening. My mind is spinning, running rampant with all sorts of thoughts. Thoughts like what? Like am I doing the right thing by putting Mia in daycare. I have to be honest with you, Rachel. Mia's teacher did seem pretty strange the other night. I really wanna know what Gabby does in the corner of that room. Why don't you just stick a video camera in the corner? That's a really good idea. I wasn't being serious. Oh, but it's still a good idea. I thought you just said everything was fine. There's just something about Gabby that I can't put my finger on. If you think Mia's in danger, you should be taking her out of school immediately. I don't... I don't think that she's in danger. I just think that Gabby's taking a special interest in our daughter, and sometimes it's like they're having a secret dialogue. Secret dialogue? - About what? - I don't know. I don't know. That's why I... wanna put the video camera in there. You can't just go sticking video cameras in the corners of rooms. Why not? It's illegal for starters. Who's gonna find out? Well, what if they do? What if they find out? And then what? They're gonna put a concerned mother away for videotaping a classroom? Besides, you're an attorney. You can make sure I don't go to jail. Oh, great. Now I'm an accomplice. I have to go, okay? We'll talk about this later. How many times have I told Steve to stay off my desk? I'm trying to do my work. I need time to fix this stuff. Maybe if I turn this upside-down. Oh, that'll work. How'd that get on the Internet? Hi. Hi. How can I help you? I'm looking to secretly video record someone. Well, you've come to the right place. Cheating husband? No. That was a couple years ago. But I'm actually looking to record my daughter's daycare teacher. Really? Well, that's a new one. All right, well, let's see. We have um, we have cameras hidden inside dolls, pens, books, teddy bears. Do you have anything with live video feed? Yeah. You know what? As a matter of fact, I do. - Okay. - Follow me. Hi, Gabby. Oh, hey, Rachel. I am so glad to see you. I was just cleaning up some stuff. Actually, I have to... I'll be right back, okay? - Just stay here, stay here. - Sure. Ohh... I told them to... Hey, you know... Are you here for something? Oh, I was just gonna check in on Mia. Oh, she's at recess. You can go out back. - Sure. Thanks. - No problem. Bye. Bye. What's a good song? Let's play hop in a line. Get behind me. ♪ A, B, C, D, E, F, G ♪ ♪ H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P ♪ ♪ Q, R, S, T, U, V ♪ ♪ W, X, Y and Z ♪ ♪ Now I know my ABCs ♪ ♪ Next time won't you play with me ♪ Okay, everyone, nap time. All right, everybody, let's pull out our beds. Mia, you stay here. Look, I don't want trouble. You do exactly what I say. I don't understand why you don't understand. No child of mine is gonna cry like that, okay, Crystal? You're gonna be stronger than that, okay? Tell me what what your name is. No. It's Crystal. Crystal. Say "My name is Crystal." And I'm your mom. Sit, okay? Sit. I'm your mommy, okay? Who's your mom? Look at me, look at me. I am your mommy. Look at me. We're gonna go away from here, and you're gonna have a new daddy, It's gonna be great. It's gonna be awesome. Where do you want to go? Disneyland? We'll go, we'll go. Where do you want to go? Do you want to go to a water park? Listen, okay? I need you to understand something. No child of mine is gonna cry like that, okay, Crystal? No. Now you tell me what your name is. Crystal. That's right. Who's your mom? - No. - I am. That's right. Because I'm your mother. No. Now, if anyone asks you, play the little game. But I'm your mom. Soon enough, we're leaving. Okay? Do you understand? I'm your mother. You don't have to disrespect your mother like that, okay? You listen to everything that I say to you, right? Because I'm your mother. Okay, Crystal? Never do that again. Rachel. Is it time to sign Mia out? You know how to get to the 385 from here? We need to go. Um, you don't look well. You're breathing really heavy. Hey, can you guys help us out? That's my wife. Let's ask her. Maybe you should sit down while we finish our song. Um, Rachel. We should really do that lunch, you know. You know, to get to know each other better. Maybe next week. Barbara. What's wrong? It's Rebecca. She's dead. Oh, my God. She died this morning. Barbara, do you know Gabby's husband? Yes, I met him once. Why? Does he drive? Sometimes he picks up Gabby from school. Why, Rachel? You need to call the police. What? Why? Now! Okay, fine. Let me just tell Gabby about Rebecca. No. You need to call the police right now. Right now! 911. What's your emergency? Yes. We have reason to believe that my daycare teacher was involved in the murder of Rebecca Hart. We need someone to come to the school as soon as possible. Where you going? I can't leave the children alone with her. Oh. Be careful. I gotta make sure the children are okay. Gabby! Hi, honey. Where's Miss Gabby? Where's Miss Gabby, huh? Where's Miss Gabby? She's gone. How could you have been so stupid? - What? - What do you mean, what? What did I do? You took the license plate off the car, and you left your handicapped placard hanging on the rearview mirror. - So? - Oh, just, you know, Rachel now knows. She figured it out. So what? It was an accident. Sound familiar? Oh, you think you're just gonna get away with this, huh? Like they did? At the worst, the cops are gonna consider it a hit-and-run, and I get a slap on the wrist. There's no way they can prove that I intended to kill that girl. Her name was Rebecca, by the way. Right, Rebecca, the girl that you told me to kill. You're gonna blame this on me? You told me to do it. So if I told you to roll off a cliff, you would do that, huh? No, Gabby, I wouldn't. - I need you, Troy. - Gabby, listen to me. Get ahold of yourself. The neighbors are gonna hear us. - I don't care, Troy! - Where are you going? Where are we going? We are going to get our child. - Hey! - Get her out of the car. - What's going on? - Get her out of the car. What's going on? Okay, sweetie, let's play a game, okay? Here we go. Quick. To the house. Rachel. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, stop. What is happening? What's going on? - It's her. - It's who? You wanna pretend like it didn't happen and forget it about it, but I can't do that, Daniel. Rachel, what are you talking about? The accident. Daniel, Gabby is the mother from the accident. What? You sure about this? Look at me. I've never been so sure about anything in my whole life. This is for us. I know. I don't know. Do you think that she planned this, or is this just a coincidence? - What does she want? - She wants Mia. Who is it? It's Gabby. Grab Mia. Sweetie. Take her upstairs and call the police. - Okay. - And be quiet. Be safe. - Hello, Gabby. - What are you doing here? I thought you guys were divorced. We are. Oh, so you're just, you're getting back together? That's sweet. Okay, sweetie, okay. I need you to be very quiet for Mommy, okay? Don't say a word. Can you do that for Mommy? Can I help you with something? I'm looking for Rachel. I needed to speak with her about something. Unfortunately, Rachel's not here right now. Oh, so you're just alone? You're just alone with Mia? Yes. Oh, okay, well, you know, I could help you watch her. You know, you can do some work, and I can watch her while you wait for Rachel. No, that's good, that's good. Thank you though, Gabby. Appreciate it. So who's that? Oh, that's just, uh... That's Troy. You don't recognize him? I'm really sorry. He would get out of the car, it's just he can't walk. You don't recognize him? I mean, you nearly killed him. It's gonna be okay. Yes, hi. Please send the police immediately. Yeah, it's 4705. Yes, thank you. I don't understand. Drop the act. I mean, you told the police it was an accident? Yeah, no, it was murder, and at the very least it was vehicular manslaughter, but you got off, because you're an attorney, on a ticket for talking on the phone. Yeah. Uh... Do you remember that night? Do you remember the night that you killed my child? Take it easy. Do you remember that? Gabby, I'm sincerely sorry for your loss. My loss? My loss? My child is dead, and my husband is a cripple, and I can't even have another baby with him even if I wanted to. You call it a loss? That's really amusing. I would call it a catastrophe that destroyed my life. You're right, Gabby, I shouldn't belittle your situation. You should've been there. You should've taken accountability for what you did to my family. Gabby, the police told me it was not my fault. It was your fault! It was your fault! Gabby, Gabby, look at me. It wasn't my fault. It was an accident. An accident? No. There are no accidents. In life, these things, they happen. God does not create accidents. Every time you get into a car, you take that chance. And how many people have you prosecuted for accidents, huh? Gabby, get back in the car now! Please just get in the car! Would you just get in the car now, please? What are you doing? Troy, why are you leaving? See, that... was an accident. Rache... Rachel! Rachel. Rachel! Rachel! Rachel. Crystal! Mommy's home. - Mommy. - Shh. Rachel! I'm here for my baby. You should just give her to me. That way I don't have to hurt you. Rachel! Hey! You hurt her, I will kill you! Rachel! Rachel! If you hurt her, I'll kill you! Sounds like it came from around back. Let's go! Stop running. You're gonna hurt her! Where is she? Where is she? Stop! Rachel! 10-71, shots fired! She's not your child. Yes, she is. What do you think, this is some sort of coincidence? God made this happen. This right here, this is where fate meets! So where is my child? Rachel! Sir, are you okay? - Yeah. - We got you. Think about what you're doing here, Gabby. Think about it. Why would God do this? Why would he take your baby away from you so that could take my baby away from me? It doesn't make sense. Life doesn't make sense! If it made sense, I'd have your perfect life instead of my pathetic existence! So this... this is my chance! My chance of making it right! I'm so sorry that you lost your baby. I am. I really am. My heart broke when I heard you scream for her. Did you know that I was pregnant with Mia then? I was. We almost lost her. I almost lost my baby too. Your baby lived. My baby died. I don't know why things happen the way that they do. I-I... There's nothing that we can do about it now, okay? Yeah, there is. Tell me where Crystal is! She's in heaven, Gabby. Maybe one day you can be with her. Why would you say that? You don't know that! Okay, you're right, I don't know. I don't know if that's true. Wouldn't it be wonderful if that were true? LAPD! Put the gun down! I think you're right. Put it down! I'm coming. No! No! No! No! No! Daniel. Daniel. - Daniel? - Hey. I told you you still love me. I still love you. Where's Mia? Mia. Sweetie! Mommy's here! I'm right here! Mia, sweetie, Mommy's here. Mommy! Oh, sweet girl. Oh! I love you, Mommy. You did such a good job. You did great. Mommy loves you. Okay, let's go see Daddy. Hey! Hey, there she is! - Mia! - Our baby's okay. Oh, you did so good. I love you. Come on, get in the car. Rachel! You took everything from me! Everything!
