Hi, I'm Erskine. I live here in Washington, DC. My dad's a congressman. My hobby is interviewing people. I can get anyone to talk. My friends and I play in a string quintet. But our dream is to be a band. Hi, my name's Hoggy Livingstone. I'm 13 and three quartersgoing on 13 and five sixths. I look young, but I talk old. I live in Georgetown with mymother and her new husband and her cat, which I'm allergic to, and his two kids, which I'm also allergic to. My name is Oscar Opily. I've just entered the terrible teens. I'm an army brat. My father works with for the Joint Chiefs here in Washington. He's in charge of developingan anti-tank-guided missile destroyer with an anti-destroyerguided missile tank. So your parents are divorced? Well, isn't everyone's? I mean, let's face facts, Erskine. Divorce is one of America'sgreat institutions. Instead of two parents who fight all the time, you wind up with four whocompete for your affection. Out of the mouth of babes. My name is Newton Robinson. My parents call me Newton as in fig newton. My friends call me Fig, also as in fig newton. I'm 13 years old. My father's an architect. When I grow up, I want to be like him. I want to be an architect, a Democrat, and make six figures, whatever that means. The fact of the matter is,I don't have an actual name. Hoggy, here, who more or less invented me, says I'm your typical parent. In any given situation, I spout the cliches that parents usually rely onto get their point across. My first name is Denver, asin the capitol of Colorado. My last name is Deck, as in "all hands on deck". In case you're interested, Iwas named Denver because that's where I was conceived. My father was campaigningthere, and he took my mom along on his expense account. My name is Zelda Maple. My friends call me Zelda. My students call me Miss Maple. In theory, I am a part-timemusic teacher in this school, but what I really do is organizethe sounds that come out of your instruments so that it offends the least number of people. My mother's had threehusbands, at different times, naturally. Polyandry is when they overlap,you have them all at once. It's also known as group sex. Your mother had three husbands? She's on her third one now. He's the Secretary of something or other in the president's cabinet. Do you have any otherhobbies besides the cello? I build and flyremote-control model planes. Who are you doing this interview for, Erskine? Erskine, what's this for? Who are you doing the interview for, Erskine? What's the interview for? Hey, Erskine, do you mind telling me what this interview is for? It's me, the famous Erskine. And as for who I'm doing these interviews for, I'm doing it for the fun of it. After all these years,you're still flat, Denver. Would it be too much to askyou to give me a middle A? You're getting warmer. Warmer. Stop. And one, two, three, four. Well, I have an announcement to make. It wasn't nearly as bad as Ithought it was going to be. When you're getting down, don't you give up. Go for it. Keep on trying and don't stop. Go for it. Feeling so lonely, nobody'sthere to understand. Darkness around you,want someone to hold you. You can't hide your eyes, drop that bold disguise. Then you'll finally see, what we're here for. When you're getting down, don't you give up. Go for it. Keep on trying and don't stop. Go for it. Come on, take your best shot, go for it. I'm feeling red hot, go for it. When you're getting down, don't you give up. Go for it. Keep on trying and don't stop. Go for it. Oh god, I think this is it, my first zit. Do you see it? You want my professional opinion? There's absolutely nothing there. Anyway, everyone knows you can't have zits unless you have pubic hair. What makes you think I don't have pubic hair? I just assumed. Well, you just assumed wrong. Well, don't get uptight. We need to hear it. I've had my punctuation already. Punctuation? My period, dumb-dumb. I ovulate. So are you guys into masturbation yet? You know, you ask a lot of questions for a girl. Look it, if we're going to be a quintet, not to mention a rock group, we've got to be open with each other. Relationships should be based upon honesty. Anyway, it's no federal crime not to masturbate. Well, I masturbate. Oh yeah, me too, me-- too? Well, I, uh, guess I do too. Likewise. Likewise what? I-- Say it. I masturbate. Masturbation makes you deaf. What? I said masturbation makes you deaf. What did you say? You look pretty grim. Because of Monday-morning blues. Oh. I wish school would start on Tuesday. Yeah, it'd end on Thursday. Yeah, which would leave us a four-day weekend. Hoggy, Fig, wait up! Hey, how are you guys doing? well, she heard-- What's going on here? Look, there's Oscar. What's everyone whispering about? Haven't you heard? Haven't we heard what? Miss Maple got mugged last night. Oh, my god, what she hurt? Was she ever. The mugger threw some kind of acid in her face and nearly blinded her. She's going to need an operation. What a bitch. Where is she? She's at the Memorial Hospital. How you doing, Miss Maple? Who's that? It's me, Newton Robinson. Newton? Oh, Newton, I'm doing just fine, I suppose, all things considered. It must be hard notbeing able to see and all. Denver-- yes, it's hard, but I just thank the good lord they didn'tdo anything to my hearing. Bye, Miss Maple. How could anybody mug Miss Maple? We absolutely have todo something to help her. She's a part-time teacher. She has no health insurance. We're talking about taking up a collection for her. The operation costs $100,000. How are we going to get ourhands on that kind of bread. Bread doesn't grow on trees, you know? Money neither. Poor Miss Maple. How can we help her? Yeah what a bitch. Watch out, everybody, I think he's getting another one of his brainstorms. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 28, 28.50, 29. One of the adults must have passed himself off as a student. Well, that leaves only $99,971 to go. There's got to be a wayfor us to make big bucks. What about computer crime? People make millions that way. I hate computers. I don't hate computers. I just don't understand how they work. I mean, how can you do addition if you don't have fingers to count on? What if we was to writea book for kids about sex. We could talk about femaleejaculation, multiple orgasms, the g-spot, that sort of thing. Everything you wanted to know but the parents wouldn't tell you. What's a multiple organism? No, it's orgasm, Oscar, not organism. It's what women have that men can't. No, no, a book would take too long. We'd have to research it, then we'd have to write it, wait forthe publisher to publish it. Yeah, but I mean, theresearch part could be fun. You got a dirty mind, Hoggy. All this talk about sex isgoing to give me heart failure. Then you'll be sorry. What we need is somethingwe can sell to someone. I got it. All we got to do to get some money-- sell secrets. Secrets, what secrets? Like the guys in movies. They secrets to the Russians. I still think sexresearch would be more fun. We make up secrets. Since what we'll be selling is secret, they can never know if it's made up or not. Erskine may be on to something. How would we contact themso they wouldn't know they were dealing with adolescents? That's easy. We'd use dead-letter drops. But-- I don't get it. A dead-letter drop is a secret hiding place, like behind a radiator in apublic building, or in a hole in a tree in the park. You leave the letter there,you tell them you've left it. They come, pick it up,leave money in its place. They never see us, we never see them. Then we secretly donate the money to Miss Maples so she can get her eyesight back. I think it's humongous,being spies for the Russians. Let's put it to a vote. All those in favor, raise their hands. It's settled then. The sins of commission have become spies. All right, there's our dude. The thing to do is splitup so he doesn't notice us. All right, Hoggy, you and Oscar follow him from across the street. Denver and I and Newtonwill follow him from behind. All right, whatever you do, act natural. He's a closet American. Come on. Come on! I don't get it. What do you think he's doing? There's only one way to find out. Nah, you wouldn't have the guts. I dare you. Well, wait a minute. What are you going to do ifhe doesn't speak English? What a bitch. Go ahead. My name is Vladimir Timoshenko. I am 37 years of age. And I am a first secretaryin a Soviet Embassy here in Washington. Here's my question. What are you doing in the park? Why aren't you at the embassydoing whatever secretaries do? I suppose there is noharm in answering you that. After all, you're just a small child. I am in charge of analyzingthe American public opinion. And every once in a while,I get into my blue jeans and chew gum, listen to Bette Midler, and make believe that I am an American so I can understand what goes onin those capitalist heads of yours. And you, sonny boy, who are youdoing this interview for, heh? Get a hold of this. It's a photo of the Sergeant York ground-to-air missile system. Uh-uh uh-uh. Here's a new Isrealiautomatic rapid-fire rifle that's replacing the Uzi submachine gun. Would you leave aphotograph of the control panel of a Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile silo? I've got the best yet. A cross-section diagram of the new Abrams main-line battle tank. No. What do you have against the Abrams main-line battle tank? I don't have anything againstAbrams main-line battle tank. It's just that if we can waltz right into a store and buy a picture of it, you can bet the Russians have alsowaltzed right into a store and bought a picture of it. Erskine's right. I never thought of that. Well, then where are wegoing to get our secrets from? What we need is some place with pictures of military equipmentthat the Russians wouldn't even think of looking for. Oh, look at that. What about this? Denver, Mohawk 4B-150? Denver, look. Stealth F-19 Fighter. I think we got us our secret. And that completesthe tail section. Where'd you learn todo that kind of stuff, Fig? I told you when you interviewed me. I want to be like my father. I picked it up watching him. What is it with you and zits? You'd think it was leprosy or something. Zits worse than leprosy. It's like having anadvertisement over your head that says "adolescent". Nobody takes a kid with zits seriously. You got to learn to take it in your stride. Easy for you to say. You don't even have any zits. You're doing it again. Doing what again? You're staring at my boobs. You're almost as obsessed withthem as you are with zits. You're accusing me of staring at your boobs? It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's the kind of thingthat can happen to anyone. Hey, guys, what do you think? What I think is the Russians will pay plenty to get their hands on this. It's humongous, Newton. How much do you think we can ask for it? I'm going to be real careful. You see, if we ask for too little, they might be suspiciousthat the plans aren't real. But if we ask for too much, theymight not be able to afford it. Hey, what in the heck did you do that for? Well, we give them half, andwe tell them we'll give them the other half for 25 big ones. Then we sit back and waitand see what they give us. 25 big ones. Did anybody ever tellyou you're very original? For a boy. He's reading the note again. He's thinking about it. He's getting up. He's having second thoughts. Oh wait, he's hesitating. He's starting for the statue. He's walking towards the statue. He swallowed the bait! Yes! Pervert! 25 big ones. That is not peanuts. Yes, but if this is genuine, the thin man will be very pleased. I want his identity. I want his name, his age, his religion, his connections, his habits, his weaknesses, his past, his present. Along with the payment, they have to include a personal note complimenting him on the high quality of his information. We must play this new spy with great skill. They can do this or I can do it myself. Good lord. The identity of the thin man is one of the most closely-guardedsecrets in the Soviet military establishment. But we do know his name is Victor, sir. We don't know his age. We don't know what he really looks like. All we know for sure is that he is the mastermind behind Soviet espionage activity in North America. Now, do we really know that he's thin? No, at least not from that picture. Well, maybe he stoppedjogging around the Kremlin. So we're looking for aperhaps formerly thin man named Victor something, who might have jogged around the Kremlin. Jesus-- what other gems do you have for me? Our source in Moscow, theman who took that photograph is fairly certain that the thin mancomes to America to personally de-brief his key agents. Chances are, sir, he's passing himself off as a businessman or a tourist, someone who could come over for a fewdays and not arouse suspicion. Good lord. Gentlemen, our worstnightmares are coming true. The thin man has amaster spy in Washington. He's already given him theplans for the Stealth jet, a plane so secret we don'teven publicly admit it exists. Well, the way I see it is if this spy got his hands on the Stealth,God knows what other secrets he'll give away. What a bitch. I'll get my people to compilea list of everyone who had access to the Stealth plant. What good will that do? The names will run into the hundreds. I don't care if they run into the thousands. Put this onto the front burner. I want every Russian who stickshis nose out of that embassy followed day and night. Oh, what I wouldn't give for one good snapshot of the thin man's face. We've been checking outthe dead letter drop for a week now. If there's nothing there, it must mean they didn't fall for it. I know. Denver? Denver? Denver? What do you say, Denver? What do you say, Morgan? What about us taking a flick Saturday? Thanks, but I've seen it already. How do you know if you'veseen it if I didn't see what flick I want to go see? Whenever flick you want togo see, I've seen it already. Anyway, I'm going to themovies with Erskine here. What ya doin, Denver, robbing the cradle? You need someone witha little more experience. Don't you read the newspapers, dummy? The only ones really safe to fool around with are the certified virgins. Yeah? He looks like a certified virgin. Hey, come on guys, here we go. What did you have to go and say that for? There's nothing wrong with being a virgin. It's very wonderful peoplehappen to be virgins. Me, for example. Did you catch those zits? I hope they're not contagious. Morgan's a pathetic nerd. I already been to the movies with him twice. All he wants to do is feel me up. Feel you up as in feel you up? He doesn't believe in foreplay. What's foreplay? When you talk before you touch. I'm not ready to be felt up yet. Erskine, I gotta ask you something, and I want a straight answer. No bullshit, promise? Yeah, promise. How do you see our relationship? Is that what we have? I mean it, Erskine. Puberty is a difficult period for a girl. She has a right to know what to expect, and how soon she can expect it. All right, we belong to the same rock group and the same quintet and the same spy ring. Erskine, I'm not talking aboutour professional relationship. I'm talking about our personal relationship. Our personalrelationship is humongous. Humongous? You're doing it again, Erskine. Doing what? You're zeroing in on my boobs again. I am, aren't I? Whenever you're ready, I'm ready. Wait a minute, I thought youweren't ready for that kind of thing yet. When Morgan paws me atthe movies it's one thing. When a friend puts his hand on your heart, well, that's different. I think I'll take a rain check. Look at those dudes, will ya? What a bonehead I am. I should have thought of that. They put something in thedead letter drop, all right. But they're watching to seewho's going to pick it up. And our dudes are watchingtheir dudes watching. I think we should move a little closer. Cinderella six, any sign of the pick up yet? Cinderella nine, no, joy. Mr. Balloon man,can I have a balloon, please? Get rid of those damn kids. Geesh,even the station chief's here. Which one? The chauffeur. Cinderellafour, get a shot of him, please. All Cinderellas, stay on your toes. Erskine, how are we going toget it without them seeing us? --three four. Can't deny I was sure I wouldknow baby when it was my time. They would jump, I would shake my head no, baby. Then you came out of nowhere,you've got me into your sights. We just came in right there,oh how you changed my life. Bullseye, you hit the mark. Bullseye, I'm fallin'. Bullseye, you've got my heart. Bullseye, I'm falling in love. All along I was sure theywould be the same as the rest-- Timoshenko! I was wrong 'cause a feelingshot through me and I confess, the things you do to make mesay your name like a prayer-- You ought to be ashamed of yourself, young man. --cause you spoke and I look,and right there, bullseye, you hit the mark. Bullseye, I'm fallin'. Bullseye, you got my heart, bullseye-- It's not my day. Maybe it is my day after all. You mean our day, comrade. 24,200-- 29-- - 24,300-- 30-- 24,400, 24,500, 24,600-- 30.50-- - 24,700-- - 31-- 24,800-- 31.25-- 24,900-- 31.26, 31.27-- 25,000 31 dollars and 27 cents. Dollars? Dollars. Since when have we made playing classical? I realize that. A little bit of all right! We got it. We did it! 25 big ones. Who would have believed it? There's more where this came from. Yeah! Woo! All right! Living it up! Living it up! Living it up! Living it up! Living it up! Living it up! Comrade. Russians always call people thatthey're tight with "Comrade". It mean something like "soul brother." No one never called me "comrade" before. No one's ever calledme "soul brother" before. Read the part where they promote us to Lieutenant Colonel in the KGB. Read the part about us gettingthe order of the red star. I like the bit about the health insurance plan for spies. Jeez, I haven't even started working yet, and I got health insurance. We've got to plan ournext step very carefully. The thin man, he'll be furious. How could we know some kidswould play decadent rock music? It's decadent but it's beautiful. Let us hope that this new spy of ours will keep in touch with us again, hmm? Timoshenko! Be so kind to pass me a straw. We thought we were on to something when the Russians staked out the park, but some kids staged an impromptu rock concert. Whoever it was the Russianswere waiting for never showed. The spy was scared off with the rock music. Well, I would be too. If there's somethinghumorous in this situation, I would appreciate it if you'd let me in on it. There's a Russian spy out there somewhere. You've got to nail him! Hey Erskine, how many timesdo you plan to interview me? Until you get to the real you. All right, what's the single thing you're most afraid of in the whole world? That I'll end up with a chestas flat as an ironing board. My mom says not to worry, thatshe was a late bloomer too, but I'm not taking any chances. I give them all the encouragement I can. What do you mean? Well, every morning I sit-infront of the mirror for five minutes and I talk to them. Grow, titties, grow! Grow titties, grow! Last time I interviewed you, you said your mother wasworking on her third husband. What effect does this have on you? None whatsoever. If you want to know the truth,my parents fought so much, it was a relief when they separated. They're perfectly happy living apart. They get along better now than they did when they were married. Just the other day, when my father came to take me to lunch, hewas very friendly with my mom. And when he left, he-- And when he left? When he left, he shook handswith her, if you must know. Well, what'swrong with shaking hands? Don't you see? He didn't kiss her. It means it's all over between them! Holy shit! I don't believe this! Ah! Die! Die! Die! Hey! What's that? What's that? I think we got another secret. Hold on! They throw the ring, theycatch it, they're happy. They throw the ring, they catchit, and they're not happy. How can I understand such a game? The bird is on the wing. The boss is right behind him. Don'tlet him out of your sight. Let's go. Whoops, sorry about that. I am so clumsy. I seem to have lost my car keys. Ah! Two tickets, thank you, thankyou, thank you, thank you. Tickets please. It's all right, I'm a diplomat. It still costs a dollar. Thank you. My god, Timoshenko, we are running one the great spies of all time. Let us get this to the thin man immediately! Good lord! The ruskis stillhave to give in the $25,000 to get the other half of the plan. And we're going to be therewhen they make the pay off. Jake, it's Eastman. I need a helicopter with full surveillance gear. Helicopter with surveillance? Yeah, put Kopeck in the laundry vehicle, and Mewens in the deliveryvan in front of the embassy. Delivery van at the embassy. And no matter what we do, we can't lose him. This is mobile 12. Red herring is rollingin a black Peugeot sedan. I'm taking up position on his tail. Stay tight, don't lose him. Yeah, I still have him in sight. Break off, mobile three. Mobile eight, pick him up on Pennsylvania. Red herring has turned into the Naval Museum. Let's get a blanket on that museum. Mobile 12 here. He's all yours. Over and out. Whirly bird, breaking off. This is three. Relax, I've got him. He's right under me. The Red Herring has stopped overnext to one of the exhibits. Red Herring has removed an envelope from his briefcase. He appears to beattaching it to the struts of a small helicopter. A helicopter! What the-- Jeez,that's a toy helicopter. It's taking off with the envelope. Oh, boy! Well, whatdo we do about red herring? No time to think about what's right. All the stuff that peoplesay don't interest me. I'm looking on. No one's going to tell me how I've got to be. Gonna be lookin' for the-- Quick, cover the exit! Get him! Get him! Turn it back! No! God! Come on! Close those doors! I can't be movin', out of control! Out of control! Out of control! I got the door wide open. Out of control! Out of control! Out of control! It's escaped! The helicopter has escaped! Out of control. There ain't no way to hold me down. Savin' it for next time, that's news to me. If you're not looking to getdown, do yourself a favor, don't get close to me. Gonna get all that I desirenow 'cause I can't wait. Better be clearing out the streets, better get ready for the heat-- All right. Yeah! Amazing! Come on, let's get out of here. Out of control! Out of control! Out of control! I don't know where I'm going. Out of control! Out of control! Out of control! I can't get moving, out of control! Out of control! Out of control! I've got the door wide open-- $25,000. Read the letter again, Erskine. I like the part where they promote us to full Colonel in the KGB. I like the part where we getthe order of the red banner. Yeah, but I like the bit about the life insurance plan for spies. I haven't even started working yet, and I got health insuranceand life insurance. Whoa-- I was young, barely 18. I could show the whole world I was your man. Ran around with the wrongcrowd, tried to be a big-- The position of the woman on top. There isn't anything that automatically makes this position work. It is the freedom ofmovement it gives the woman to seek her own satisfaction, which in large part explains why it is soeffective for some women, especially women of masturbationtype roman numeral three. You know, I knew it would come some day. I just thought I'd be ableto put off the inevitable for a little while longer. And this position is oneseen in the earliest Stone Age drawings as well as on thewall murals at Pompeyii X-rated wall murals. You know, you haven't heard a word I've said. Not again. Bring your face over hereand let me have a look. This time it even itches. Zits don't itch. Maybe there's nothing there buta figment of your imagination. Mm-mm, I can feel when I rub. It must be just under the skin, waiting to pop like a time bomb. Seriously though, I cameto a big decision last night. You know, a lot of women fakehaving orgasms, but not me. When I finally make love with someone, I'm going to fake not having orgasms. You know, you're a real number, Denver. Why are you going to do that? I read in this woman's magazine where it's a real turn on formen to try to make women who have trouble having orgasms come off, so i figure why spoil their fun. You spend an awful lot of time on my boobs. Are you ready to you know what? Now? Here? I think I'll take another rain check. Jesus, Erskine, I'm beginningto wonder what I see in you. Erskine is not my idea ofyour average sexy name. You don't want to touch my boobs. It's not that I don't want to. It's just that I can't get my arm to do what my head tells it to do. Hey, a likely story. Oh hey Erskine, have youseen this about the spring kite-flying contest? It says here, the only regulation is you gotta make the kite yourself. You can't go out and buy one. What do you say we enter it, huh? We could get Newton todesign us a humongous kite on his daddy's drawing board. We could build it just like one of my model planes. We could call it after our rock group, "The Sins of Commission". It'd be great publicity, and we might even get a gig or two out of it. What do you say, huh? Eh, it could be fun. Ah! Ow! What was that for? I was only trying to make it rain so we can cash in your rain check. Come on, Erk. Ersk? Ersk-- Ersk. And then-- I see it like an orbiting space station. It should have a funny box-shaped dish antenna at one end. It should have tinfoil all over so it looks like a giant mirror. Also something sticking out too, like sunlight for its batteries. Da da, da-da da-da! It's stupendous. You see what you can dowhen you put your minds to it. Fasten your seat belts. Erskine here is coming up withanother one of his brainstorms. What if-- What if what? What if we was to sellFig's plan to the Russians? Yeah, we could say it was a "top-secret Star-Wars laser-reflecting"Pentagon satellite. Well, shucks, it looks as if it could be. Well, how would they know it wasn't? They swallowed the Stealth and the B-1. They'll assume this is real too. You'd fool me. I'd pay 25 big ones for it. And we wouldn't even have to give them half now and half later. Give them the whole plan at once. They'd pay up, because they'd think there's more where this came from. Now I know what I see in you, Ersk. You're not only a certified virgin, you're a certified genius. It's obviously some sort of satellite. But it's so secret, I can't seemto find anyone at the Pentagon who knows about it. Keep looking. Sometimes they swing, and they're called out. Sometimes they don't swing,and they're called out. Sometimes they don't swing,and walk calmly to the base. Who can understand such a game? Subject seems to be watchingthe Little League game. To all units, executecontingency plan Charlie. God! If there was a sign thatsaid "keep off the grass", I didn't see it. And anyway, I have a diplomatic immunity. Cao. 25 big ones. Oh, my god. Here, let's read the letter again. I love the part where they promote us to a General in the KGB. Imagine us getting theOrder of Lenin at our age. I still like the bit aboutthe retirement plan for spies. I got health insurance, I got life insurance, I got a retirement plan-- And he hasn't even started working yet. You know, we didn't sellhim the plans to some model airplane this time, we sold him the plans to some dumb old kite. You're talking about the kite that's going to win the spring kite contest. Hey, don't count your chickens before they're hatched. Hey, I mean, the puppet's right. We don't even know if we can get off the ground. Maybe we should test flyit under field conditions. Yeah, let's test fly it right now. Fine by me. The Sins of Commission will fly. Here we go! Good Come on, up, up, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! All right, keep going! All right, cool. All right! I showed this plan to thePentagon chief of Satellite Research and Development. I showed it to the Air Force general who's in charge of theentire satellite project. I showed it to theChairman of the Joint Chiefs, who's in charge of the entireUS military establishment. None of them had ever set eyes on it before. How can the thin man get theplans for one of our satellites that we don't have? There's something very strange about all this. Maybe we misunderstood. Maybe this is the plan fora secret Russian satellite. Or maybe our agent in Moscowhas been turned by the ruskis. He's just giving us this information. Oh gentlemen-- Keep it up, keep it up. Let off some more slack. Come on, you got this. Here, hold it like that. You can take it off there. What a bitch! Hoggy, I think we're in trouble. Wait a minute, they're kids. What the hell is this? I know they're kids. Let's go. Um, excuse me, Hoggy, who are they? Hey, come here! You wait for it. What have you been eating? You please come here. Come here! Come here, you little-- In the movies, they always make criminals sit on uncomfortable chairs and shine lights in their eyes. This is not a movie, Erskine. This is real life. You and the other kids have been selling secrets to the Russians, right? Wrong. We never sold theRussians secrets, not one. What did you do with the $75,000 you got? Well, we sort of donatedthe first 50 of it. We would have donated the restif you hadn't interrupted us. Donated it to whom? To Miss Maple, our music teacher, so she can have an eye operation. Excuse me, may I go to the bathroom? How'd it go? Are they going to tell our parents? No talking! My father will kill me if hears that we're spying for the Russians. I'm going to lose my allowancefor the rest of my life. Come on, Ersk, tell us what happened in there. I told them everything. Everything? I said no talking! Did they know about the 75 big ones? Yep. Did you tell them that we'vebeen promoted to a general in the Russian army? Mm-hmm. My father's going to kill me when he hears I'm a Russian General. He's only a Lieutenant Colonel. How can he kill you? You outrank him. I never really thought about that. Maybe we would plead insanity. These kids have fooled the thin man into thinking he has a master spy in the American military establishment. He's so pleased with theinformation he's getting, he made the spy a General. Too, the thin man doesn'tknow who his master spy is, but he's dying to find out. That's true, sir. He'd give his right armto debrief him in person. He wants to kiss him on both cheeks, pin a medal on his breast,and make goddamn sure he keeps on spying for him. We can't do that. They're children. That's precisely why we can do it. In a million years, thethin man would never suspect that we would use children. You kids can come on in now. Oh god, I forgot, I have a dentist appointment. My retainer needs tightening. Maybe it's loosening. OK, you kids are introuble up to your necks. You sold information to the Russians. You're not going to make a federal case out of a model plane, are you? The fact is that because of you kids, the Russians wound up withdetails of the Stealth jet and the B-1 bomber. No matter how you slice it, it's a federal case. - I really don't feel so good.- Please sit down. How old are you kids? 13, 14? You should probably get out, with good behavior, by the time you're 40. 40? Jesus, I'll be menopausal. - 40 is not that old. - Are you kidding? Everything over 25 is down hill. Maybe the judge will be lenient on us because we're kids. Maybe they'll be lenienton me because I'm a girl. Maybe he'd be lenient on me because I'm black. Now what the judge is going to go easy on a Russian General, huh? I want my mom. I want my lawyer. On the other hand, a judge might just go easy on kids who cooperated with their government. And if they cooperated hard enough, the matter might not evenget as far as a judge. Oh, no. Here we go again. If these kids that you're talking about cooperate hard enough, could they do what they want with the last 25 big ones they got from the Russians? I don't see anybody objecting to that. And if these kids you're talking about cooperate hard enough, is it possible they can get another 25big ones for their trouble? You're pushing your luck, Erskine. We might see our way clearto giving you 10 big ones. No, 25. 20, and that's my final offer. You could have told. All right, 25 big ones for your services. So what is it we got to do? I want you tocontact the Russians again. You're going to tell them that you're ready to meet the thin man. I have a hunch he'll comeover to debrief you himself. I get it. As soon as-- If only life were that simple. The thin man is cagey. He'll meet you in Cuba or on a ship. And if my plan works, you kidswill be the first Americans to get a look at his face. When you get back, I'll sit you all down with our composite artist,you'll describe the thin man, and he'll draw him. The next time he enters this country, we'll know what he looks like, and grab him. Why bother? I'll just interview him for you. Interview him? Yeah, with my video camera. You have a video camera? It's in my knapsack. Interviewing people is my hobby. The thin man on video-- come on, he'll never sit still for that. Jesus, he really showed up. Oh, god, are you sure wehave to go through with this? Well, we got to. They'll put us in jail and throw away the key. We'll be 40 by the time we get out. They are children. What are thesechildren doing here? I don't know. Maybe they're having a picnic. They can spoil the whole operation. They can scare the contact. Go for it, Denver. Go! Go away! Go away! Go! Go away! Go away! Zaluska. That's the password. They are the contact? Zaluska! Children, come with us for a ride. Haven't I seen these kids before? Oh, no, we're really going to do this, huh? Climb aboard little boy. Thanks. Enjoying your split bananas? You mean banana splits. I thought they were called split bananas. He's right. They are called split bananas. Did I say banana splits? What a jerk I am. I meant split bananas. They're absolutely humongous. Which one of you kids gotall those plans you sold us? We all did. Oscar here's father works forthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. And Erskine's father is a congressman. And my stepfather is the secretary of something or other in the president's cabinet. And your father really works with Joint Chiefs? Uh, yeah. He's in charge of developingan anti-tank guided missile destroyer. No, wait a minute. Was an anti-destroyer guided missile tank. Anyhow, he brings the planshome at night in his briefcase, and so that's how I-- That's how come he was able to get them. Yeah. I see. And which one of you got the bright idea of doing business with us? That's me. I always admired Russia, so I thought why not give these plans to them. What is it exactly you admire Russia for? Its size. When you look at a worldmap, it looks kind of big. I see. I see. Timoshenko! What about the camera? What the hell are we doing, man? I mean-- Where did they go? They obviously did it for the money. I wouldn't trust anyAmerican who says that he prefers our system to theirs. Just a stupid bad joke, that's all. They could be a goldmine of information. I don't think so. What if-- Americans will neversuspect us using children. - I'm going to do it. - Go for it. Never. That's brilliant. It's like a child's play. Let's say you have something for us, so you mailed us a picturepostcard to the address that I gave you. So let's say if you sign it, let's assume, "love, Johnathan", we know thatyou planted a package for us behind the radiator in the men's room on the ground floor of the treasury building. It is child's play, hm? Uh, can I ask you a question. Sure. Could you tell mea little bit about yourself? I'm afraid it's not possible. Couldn't you even tell me where you live? That's classified information. Are you married? That is also classified. What about children? Children? Yeah, do you have any kids? Yes, I do. What's their names? How old are they? Demitri is 21. My daughter's name is Yekaterina. She's what you Americans call "sweet 16". What do they do? Demitri is studyingpolitics at the University. Yekaterina wants to manage a boutique store. She likes fancy clothes, and she likes money. All they Demitri i is to buy Levi's blue jeans and on the black market, and to get some tape, something called "Rastaman Vibrations." Every time I talk to them, they have those Walkman plugs in their ears with a teeny noise coming out. They say they listen to music, but it doesn't sound like music to me. It sounds like noise, regular noise. And it frightens me. And there is nothing I can do about it. I'm going to be sick. I don't think split bananas agree with me. Hello, Hoggy, piano. That's better, Erskine. Good, Denver, good. That happens to be the bestchamber music I've ever seen. I don't mean to be nosy,but what's with the Band-Aid? Oh, that? I cut myself shaving. Uh-uh, uh-uh. All right, I got my first zit. Take a look. Hey, congratulations. Thanks. Welcome to the world of zits, Ersk. How do you feel? Like maybe I'll survive after all. I think you'll survive, too. I'm going through changes. I'm losing myself to you. I can't believe it happened all so fast. When I see myself in your eyes,I start to lose control again. I try to take it slow, but I can't pretend. Will you be mine, my firsttrue love, I'm already fallin. Maybe we'll find-- The trouble with me is I look weird. I think you'regreat looking for a girl. You don't have to say that. I got eyes. I mean it, Denver. You're terrific. Do you honestly think so? Anyone who says you lookweird is off their rocker. You don't think I'm sort of flat chested? Not at all. Not for your age. I always thought you didn'twant to, you know, touch me, because you thought therewas nothing there to touch. That wasn't it at all. I swear, Denver, I'll prove it. If the offer still holds. Go for it, Ersk. Wow. It's the first time I ever actually touched a living girl's-- Breast. Breast. How was it? It was humongous. Was it really humongous? Really, humongous. I'll tell you a dark secret, Ersk. It was the first time for me too. What about Morgan in the movies and all that? I made that up to impress you. I'm glad my first time was your first time. Likewise. Who knows, maybe we'll sharesome other firsts someday. So how do you feel, Denver? How do I feel? As high as a kite. Hey, guys! Come on, wait up! Come on! Go for it. Go for it! All right. You know something, Ersk? I like you a lot. I may even love you a little. Likewise. All around, you changed my life. Bullseye, you hit the mark. Bullseye, I'm fallin'. Bullseye, you got my heart. Bullseye, I'm fallin' love. All along I was sure we wouldbe the same as the rest. I was wrong 'cause the feeling shot through me and I confess the things you do to make me say your name like a prayer. Now I believe it baby that youspoke for my love when I can't. Bullseye, you hit the mark. Bullseye, I'm fallin'. Bullseye, you've got my heart. Bullseye, I'm fallin' in love. There ain't no way to hold me down. Saving it for next time 'cause that's history. If you're not looking to getdown, do yourself a favor, don't get close to me. Gonna get all that I desire,now because I can't wait. better be clearing out the streets, better be ready for the heat. putting my hand right nearthe fire, all that I can take. No way to tell where I mightgo, I can be dangerous you know. Out of control! Out of control! Out of control! I don't know where I'm going. Out of control! Out of control! Out of control! I keep on movin'. Out of control! Out of control! Out of control! I got the door wide open. Out of control! Out of control! Out of control! Woo! Out of control! Out of control! No one can make me change for you. Stand back and look at what you've got to do. Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Feelin' down, don't you give up. Go for it! Keep on trying and don't stop! Go for it! Come and take your best shot. Go for it! Go for it! You're feelin' red hot. Go for it!
