(instrumental music playing) (alarm clock ringing) (on tv) Come on! Three good minutes! Hustle! Hustle! Let's go! Come on! Watch the pool. Watch the pool! CATANA STARKS: Good morning, ladies! - Stacey! - Yes? 2:09:64 at Central Florida in March 200-meter butterfly. Hey! Eyes up here! I can rattle off numbers all day long for everybody in here. I watch a lot of film. Another thing, Stacey. 35, what does that number mean? - That's my MCAT... - CATANA: Speak up! - It's my MCAT score! - CATANA: That's right! For those of you that don't know, 35 means Stacey can go to any medical school she pleases. (applause) Let me tell you how she did it. Work. First in the library, last out every night, and that deserves a round of applause. (cheering) DEAN WINTERS: 4,550 career-receiving yards, 328 career receptions. Kendrick Paulsen's name is already all over TSU's record books, and we are proud to have him back as our newest athletic director. But before I have him speak, I'd like to acknowledge the Paulsen family. Kendrick Paulsen, Sr. specifically, and his 20 million dollar grant to our endowment fund. But without further adieu, Kendrick Paulsen, Jr. (applause) The first order of business we have a total noncompliance issue. The baseball team will need to be cut and replaced with two smaller teams to have an equal balance of male and female athletes. The women's team is set at lacrosse, but we have not decided what the men's team will be. How about golf? - Golf? - You know what I heard? They got the name The Masters from the slave masters, plantation owners! - Really? - That's what I heard. That's my point exactly. Now you take a sport like golf that's so hostile to us and show 'em what's what. Like Tiger Woods. There you go. Here's...here's the problem with golf. There's no access for most black kids. There's no such thing as an inner city country club. Didn't stop Grambling, Jackson State, they got programs. I mean if Grambling and Jackson State have programs, that leaves X number of kids that won't be coming here. Why wouldn't they? We've got tradition. We produced 59 Olympic athletes. Now, that's more than most countries. I'm just telling you that golf is not a popular sport with the kinds of kids that come here, and it's expensive. Expensive? Look, every year I give more and more, and I see less and less. I'm done. We need a better football program, better basketball, track and field, and golf. (instrumental music playing) ROGER: Hey, you heading out? Yeah. First day on the job, huh? Who's light is on? Oh, that's Starks, ladies swim coach. Didn't the season just end? You haven't met Starks have you? She wouldn't leave early if the school is burning down. Good night, boss. (cd) The price of success is and has always been sacrifice. The truly exceptional do not work nine to five, rarely take vacations and struggle deeply to maintain pers... Everyone wants to be at the top. If you are willing to do what it takes to... I didn't mean to startle you. I saw the light on. I figured I'd drop in. Oh, it's no problem. Catana Starks, swim coach. Kendrick Paulsen, Jr. I'm the new athletic director. Kendrick Paulsen? Nice to put a face to the name. Heard a lot about you. What have you heard? Well, 4,500 career-receiving yards. That was a long time ago. Yeah, but it's still impressive. I can respect what it takes to be an athlete. Well, I got out of football before it got me. I, uh, didn't need the injuries, and I definitely didn't need the money, so... Well, yeah, your dad's pretty loaded. - He gives a lot of money. - Thank you. You...you know, I don't know how often it gets publicized, but I left football to pursue a Master's in business. I manage portions of my father's company so I'm part of that success too. Great. How was your first day? Unbelievable. The board wants me to put together a men's golf team. Golf? Yeah, why? I just...I...I used to play when I was in college. I got kind of a sentimental attachment to the game. You got any candidates lined up? No, not yet. I'm just getting started. I'll take it. Excuse me? I...I'm just saying I'm interested. I'll take it. But you've never coached golf before, and like I said, it's our men's team. I heard you. Well, if you love the sport so much then why did you stop playing it? You know, you got to devote your life to golf, couldn't find work coaching it, so I did other things. Look, I'm just asking that you consider me, please. It was a pleasure to meet you. You too. Welcome. Thank you. (instrumental music playing) Listen...listen, this is a once in a life opportunity. You'll start in on the ground floor and work your way up. You'll have my support. You'll have scholarships. You'll have funding. You'll have everything you need. It's an easy answer. The question is, are you in or are you out? Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, as long as you're out, you know anyone who coaches golf? Just give it to Starks, Ken. I can't. I don't know if she can do the job, and I need someone I feel comfortable with. So you're cold calling country club employees? I mean, look at her. She's half my size. No college athlete's gonna give her the respect a coach needs. Starks has been tested many times. She has earned it. With the budget you got, she's your best option. She can do more with less. Night, Roger. (instrumental music playing) Thank you. I can't tell you how excited I am to get back to golf. There's no contract yet. - We're working out the terms. - Okay. I should let you know upfront. Fundings gonna be tough. Yeah. Well, fundings always tough. I'm used to that. I can't give you scholarships. Excuse me? I'm trying to run a whole department and moneys needed elsewhere. My hands are tied. Yeah, I'm pretty sure the A.D. decides how the money gets spent, and you're the A.D. so who's hands are tied? You want the job or not? Well, since there's no contract and no funding, what do you suggest I do next? Well, there's a desk in the men's office after you move. I suggest you hold tryouts. Right. Thank you. Uh-huh. (instrumental music playing) Uh, Catana Starks, coach of the TSU golf team. Excuse me. Uh, excuse me. I'm with Tennessee State golf team, and I was just... I have a full scholarship at Brantley State. Okay. Never mind. No, no. You can try to pitch to me. I mean, Brantley's only won the National Minorities Championship five years running. Maybe you got something to offer too. - Who's the coach? - I am. (laughing) You're the coach? Oh, well tell me about your school. The opportunity sounds amazing. Yes, we are Division One. We don't have a record yet. We were just recruiting. We're starting. This is something new we're doing at TSU. 63 strokes? Yes, ma'am. When did you shoot that? Uh, my brother took me to one of those, uh, one of the nine hole courses, and uh, we were just out there. Oh, what? Nine hole? What about 18? Well, I mean there's no problem. That's just like a what? A pair of nine holes? Thank you for your time. - Morning, sunshine. - Hey, Roger. (sighing) Nobody wants to play here. Let me tell you something. I go bowling with a guy who works at a plant downtown. Now, he says his kid back in South Korea is a golfer. South Korea? Roger. I don't even have scholarships. You know why, don't you? No. Why? Don't tell nobody I told you. Now Winters says to Paulsen, "Hire Starks. She's been around, and she's good with money." And Paulsen says, "Well, if she's so good with money, she ain't getting any, and if she wants the job, she'll deal with it." You don't say. (instrumental music playing) BOB RUSSELL: That's our guy right there. (laughing) Bob, I'm telling you. You're gonna win some championships with this kid. (knocking on door) Come in. Kid's on the plane right now from Dusseldorf. He's gonna be our future captain. He's white. It's soccer, who cares? Kid can be neon green if he plays at TSU like he does on tape. Really! What do you want, Starks? Oh, well, I was coming over to let you know where I'm at, and Bob here is tossing offers to kids in Europe for a sport nobody watches, while I'm begging for bus fare. Interesting. Well, it's different. They've proven they can win. Really? How? Does he have lack of funding as well? Or is his captain on his way over from Dusseldorf? Where is he coming from? (laughing) - I'll talk to you later. - All right, bro. Hey, great job. Look, Ken. I'm really trying to work with you here, but I cannot do my job if I don't have the tools, okay? Scholarships, right? Yeah. Now, you'll get your scholarships. Thank you. (instrumental music playing) You get what you wanted? - There you go. - Hey, how's it going? - Hi. - What's your name? - Oh, Craig, Craig. Sorry. Are those MacGregor's? Yeah. I know they aren't brand-new or anything, but they play great. Yeah. I take 'em out after caddying and hit a few or a lot. I played a lot. What's your best stroke count? 67. On a real course? Yeah. Congratulations, you made the team. Oh, wow. CATANA: No, no, no. Don't ask your best player. I don't want him - he doesn't want me. Look, I know this may sound crazy, but who do you have in terms of black caddies? No, just caddies. (knock at door) Okay. Thank you...for nothing. Craig, you might be the last of a dying breed. Uh, what do you mean a dying breed? Well, ever since Tiger made golf hot, all the well-to-do white kids don't mind taking all the caddy jobs. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I almost didn't get mine because of all the competition, and there aren't really a lot of spots. I mean, most of the clubs use golf carts now. I mean, my high school didn't exactly have enough money for a team so... Excuse me. - Yes, hello. - Hi. Do you know where I can find Mr. Bob Russell? Oh, uh, yeah. He's out by the field. Look, why don't you take him, show him to the field. Yeah, sure. - Uh, I'm Craig. Right, okay. Well, come on then. If Bob's going international, so am I. (instrumental music playing) Yeah, I heard you're one of the best clubs in the area. I wish I had a strategy, but I...I'm just tossing up a prayer that you got somebody I can use. Name that comes to mind is Cameron Ward. He's been a caddy for six years, lives paycheck to paycheck to support his mom, but uh, she wants an education for him. Great. Who else? Cam's the only one I know. Hold on a minute. Former student of mine is a pro in the London area. I'll get you a number. He can help. No, I can't help. All of our caddies have offers, believe it or not. That's what I'm talking about! Hey, Starks, you tell me you're looking for anybody? Uh, yeah. What's the country code again? (speaking French) Scholarship! Bassam! Bassam! Scholarship! I apologize I could not get away. I do not get very much time off. That's okay. And the noise, it can get very loud in here. Oh, no problem. Man, you should see me in action. This is Ji-Kyung. He's kind of young. Oh, no. That's just a very old photo. He is 18 now. And he golfs? Yes. I get letters all the time. He wins tournaments, competitions. Why would he want to come all the way from South Korea to Tennessee State? No, no. He's in California now. His mother brought him here when he was very small, but he needs to be here with me. He does not know his culture. He has yellow hair. Excuse me? He put bleach on his hair. (laughing) He wears earrings. He does things his own way. Yeah, I like him already. (music playing) Excuse me, love. Is this Lincoln Hall? Yeah, this is Lincoln. Hey, where are you from? Don't tell me you can't tell a classy British accent when you hear one. I'm looking for my room. Uh, 102. Are you sure you got the right place? Lincoln's almost all athletes. What's that supposed to mean? I don't look like an athlete to you? That's rich coming from you with that book bag. What are you talking about? Athletes don't study, and they definitely aren't so easy on the eye. Um, uh, 102's on the right. - Right here? - Yeah. Thank you. (music playing) I'm Edward, the uh, other roommate. You okay? You look lost. Yeah. I hope I'm not losing the plot, but the bloke just dropped me off in the middle of nowhere. Oh, no. Wait a minute. I hear an accent. You must be one of Starks' guys? - Yeah. - What are you doing out here? You supposed to be at the International House. Come on. I'll show you. Well, that makes sense. I thought someone had made a mistake. Uh, I hope you don't mind me saying, but I feel a bit out of place here. (laughing) No kidding. Get up there. Hello? Oh, good day, mate. I'm Cameron. You must be Edward, huh? First to meet ya. - You're an Aussie? - Yeah, yeah, yeah indeed. What's, uh, what's this all about? Oh, I got a couple for the house actually, for all the boys. You want to hit a few? Doesn't practice start tomorrow morning? Yeah, mate. Ooh, it actually starts in a few hours. Gonna get some practice in. You know what I mean? (music playing) What's going on, man? Oh, sorry mate. I... Oh, you Edward, right? Yeah, yeah. I'm, uh, I'm gonna get some sleep. All right, then. I'll hit you up in the morning. You...you playing on the... don't worry about it. I'll see you in the morning. Yeah, no sweat brother. (instrumental music playing) Okay. Let's get it together folks. First tournament is this weekend. We got a lot of ground to cover. I need you over here. Can you get up, please? Excuse me. Hello, Crook and Castles, whatever. Turn around, please. How you doing? Take that out. My name is Catana Starks. I guess you figured by now I'm the coach. You are the Tennessee State men's golf team. By the way, this is the last time some of you will come to practice dressed like this. Start with an easy one. You're on the golf course, but you're not on the green. You're in one of two places, the fairway or the rough. Or it could be a water hazard. Fine. There are three places. Well, actually might be a sand trap. Okay, look. Let's start over. You're on a golf course. You tee off. You're either in the fairway or in the rough. Where would you rather be? Uh, fairway. In golf, yes. In life, no. Fairways are easy. If your life is a fairway, you get soft. What I love is that none of you come from fairways, and that is good by me because I need toughness on this team. Start with your name and where you're from. Ji-Kyung, South Korea. I'm sorry. One more time. Ji-Kyung. Y'all can call me Young G. Young G? Yeah. Like Ali, Tupac. Um, Cameron from Brisbane Queensland, Australia. Thank you. Next. Uh, Craig, Atlanta, Georgia. Yeah, am I the only black person on the team? Well, not unless you count Young Jeezie, Weezie, what was it? Young G. Not unless you count Young G here. Why? Is that an issue? Uh, no. Okay. Pass the ball back. Thank you. Bassam. I'm Algerian. You're from Paris, right? I'm Algerian. Edward, London. Look, love. Is this some sort of punishment? No, love. This is the first of 15 exercises that we are doing to improve core strength and shoulder flexibility. Pass it back. Sorry, you said the first exercise. - Yes. - Of 15? Correct. Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you Edward. Because for every one you don't do, your teammates do double. (instrumental music playing) When's the first time you picked up your first golf club? I was about 12. Where were you? Wimbledon Park Golf Club. Who gave 'em to you? No one. I nicked them. You nicked them? You stole them? From who? I don't know. Some rich golfer. Called me a pikey. What's a pikey? Like scum. Kid calls you scum so you stole? Hey. Oh, hey. So you didn't move into 102, huh? Athlete? Are you keeping tabs on me now? No. I just know those guys, and they said you showed up and left. Yeah, yeah. The golfers... we all got a house together now. - Oh. - Since you know the athletes, is it normal to have an hour and a half workout in your first training session? I didn't even pick up a club. I got a medicine ball straight in my chest. - Then Coach Starks, she said... - Starks? - You know her? - Yeah, she's my coach. Oh. You didn't tell me you're a golfer. - I'm a swimmer. - What? - A swimmer? - Yeah. She's a swim coach? We're being taught golf by a lady swim coach. No, I mean... yeah, she was my swim coach but she was never a great swimmer. Well, that's a relief. I'm saying it doesn't matter. She wasn't a swimmer either, and we won seven conference titles. Look, give her a chance, plus TSU is a good school. Besides, where would you be if you weren't here? I don't know, routing school, prison. Where are you going, girl? Class. You work way too hard. Yeah, yeah. Hang on a sec. These are our new clubs, right? Coach, seriously. You know, I can go and steal us some nice ones if you want. (laughing) I told the guys that the school would be providing the clubs, and we get these? What's the problem Starks? They're horrible. That's the problem. Look, how are we supposed to compete with other schools when we have woods that are actually made of wood? I gave you scholarships, didn't I? - Yes. And thank you. - Good luck. We still... What were you saying about being Algerian? What did you mean by that? - I am. - You sound French. Algerian! Okay. All right. Let's go. Everybody, let's get started. Find a stall. You do not expect me to use this, huh? Do you? For now, I do. And let's see if you can golf as well as you mouth off. You're up first. No, someone else goes first. I play when I feel like it. No, you play when I feel like it! Get a club. Here's a ball. Let's go. (instrumental music playing) You're such a French man. Algerian. Look, cool it with the attitude, okay? Who's next? (instrumental music playing) That camera's like mad old school. Yeah? And it does the job. The great thing about golf is that if you watch the greats, Nicholas and Hogan and Sam Snead, Walter Hagen, Greg Norman... he's a man who eyes a ball. That's why you have to bend your knees! Where did you learn to play? On my street. Well we're gonna get the street out of your game right now. Bend your knees. Bend your knees. That's harassment. Swing already. Come on, let's go. Keep it loose. You see some of the tricks and then try and incorporate 'em in your game. Cameron. What is it that you do besides golf? Well, I mean... yeah, uh... See? Works every time. Is that a chain? Give me that chain out of your pocket. Give me that. This ain't no rap video. You robbing me. Now, why don't you hit like that when your teammates are around? Craig, you're good. Okay? Know it. Go ahead. (music playing) (bang) JI-KYUNG: I need you to stop. I need you to hear me. (hits table) No, look! This is the way I talk, okay? This is the way I dress, how I act. This is me. No, no, you listen to me. I don't care about my given name. This is my culture. This is me. Yeah? Well, you weren't there so I had to, but you know what? That was fine by me, okay? (instrumental music playing) (indiscreet chatter) Coach Starks? Tennessee State? - Yeah. - Hank Taylor, Vandenberg. Looks like your boys and mine are goin' head to head quite a bit today. Look, I want you to meet Spielman, best All-American captain in the country. - Nice to meet you, Coach. - Nice to meet you. Now, let me show you all around, make you feel comfortable. You try this new Ping driver? - What? - This new Ping driver? Been hitting the ball 300 yards every time with this baby. You know in all my years, I have never once recruited internationally. Of course, then again I never had to. Vandenberg just got this new golf simulator. Golf simulator? Yeah, you know, one of those screens you hit into Measures your yard and accuracy? You got a screen you hit balls in to measure your yards? Do y'all not have one of those? HANK: Beautiful day for golf, Coach. Good luck, and I'll see you out there. Vandenberg's got one. We've had one since... Sorry, mate, what's this Vandenberg? Vandenberg University? Literally ten minutes away from your school. Really? What a difference ten minutes makes. Well, good luck, buddy. (instrumental music playing) Edward! The best approach is this. Yeah, maybe, but I want to go across. Get onto green one. Trust me, Edward. I scouted this course already. It's longer than it looks. Oh yeah? Watch this. Ugh! Ugh! Well done. Make this par and we tie with Vandenberg, don't we? If he doesn't make this shot, we don't tie for last. Shh! What happened back there? - Sorry. - Craig? I'll get to you in a minute. Hello? Somebody say something? Spielman, he's the best in America. No, he's not. Well, the coach said when we turned up, he said an All-American, best golfer. He's the best captain. Shawn Howard at Brantley State is the best overall player, another Tiger Woods. Picked up a golf club before he could walk. But there were no super stars like that out there! Just teams of guys playing together, and we better learn how to do that and fast! Maybe the fact that you're not actually a golf coach. You're a ladies swim coach. - Excuse me? - I met a girl that said you coached ladies swimming last year. - And? - WAITRESS: Here you go. Y'all some kind of sports team? We thought we were. Well, you look darling. And you the bus driver? I'm the coach. (laughing) Sure, sugar, and I own this restaurant. If I am just a ladies' swim coach, Edward... ...then you're nothing but street trash like that rich kid said. But I don't say that, because I don't focus on the past! I focus on potential! And I work hard to realize mine! And I expect the same of you! Now whether that ignorant waitress gets what I'm doing, doesn't matter. I'm gonna make you a golfer! All of you! And we're gonna win! You were gonna say something before all of this nonsense? Just, uh, sorry. Speak up! I'm sorry. I...I choked. Yeah? And why was that? I...I don't know. I don't know. Look, I'm sorry. I'll tell you why. Soft bigotry of low expectations. People expecting you to fail so they lower the bar to help you over like you're some dumb, poor, black kid who doesn't know the difference between a driver and a putter! Yeah, well that's not true. I know it's not, Craig! I've seen you hit! You're incredible! But you get around your opponents and even your own teammates, and you choke! 'Cause you second-guess yourself! Craig, you're no different than these guys, okay? Okay? Cameron here, he has the same training as you, and Edward before he got here, his driving range was a long alleyway. And King Bassam over here has never played in a big time tournament despite his big time attitude! What about me? I don't know, Young G. You're something else all together. Look! My point is, there are no excuses! You don't have any excuses so get that out your head, okay? We are all...all of us, including me... ...somebody else's table scraps. But that tournament... that tournament was bad! Even by table scrap standards! Better get your head in the game! Get in the van! (indiscreet chatter) Let's try something, Craig. Everybody, pay attention. Come on, I have to put looking at Young G's shoes? You got a problem with my shoes? Look, if you are getting distracted try closing your eyes. Okay, now what? Now putt. Come on, really? You know, Johnny Miller, did it. His last PGA win at Pebble Beach. Look, just give it a try. It's for a good reason. I promise. Slow down. Line the shot up. - And no cheating. - I'm not. Similar to Luke Skywalker using the force type stuff. Ooh, a black kid that golfs who's also a nerd. What a surprise? All right, fair enough. - All right, focus. - Okay. - You missed. - Yeah, I know. Hey, look. Where did the ball end up? I...I don't know. My eyes were closed. - KENDRICK: Starks! - Keep your eyes shut. Have you seen today's paper? Hold on, please. You saw where it was supposed to go. You felt how you hit it. Is it short or long? Um, I think long? How long? - Maybe about a foot or two. - Left or right. Uh, right about a foot. Open your eyes, Craig. - I was right? - Yes. Remember this. It's you and the ball, okay? Don't worry about who you're playing. Forget about the score. It's you, the ball and the green. Got it? - Got it. - Yes, Coach. Excuse me. Just take five, okay? So nice of you to come out, Ken. Your team's all over the back page of the city paper. Last place in a field of 30 teams? I can't wait for the calls to start rolling in, "Why is your team so bad and why are they so white?" Oh, come on, Ken. No one cares about that, remember? It's one thing for Bob to have a few white guys on the soccer team, and they win. It's another to lose so bad it's news. You bring in these players from all over the world, and they play like that? Ken, you act like all the good black golfers in the USA was knocking down my door, and I said, "No." These guys are the best I could do. Okay? I'm sorry if it's an embarrassment. It is. I just sent out the paper work for the National Collegiate Minority Championship. The PGA sponsors it, it's important. Mark it on your calendar now... ...so you don't blow that one, too. Good day, love. All right, so uh, what is on the menu today? Oh, you'll love the gumbo. It's got onions, celery, shellfish. Oh, sorry. Yeah, can't eat shellfish. Maybe try the clam chowder then. No. Sorry, no. I just...I really can't eat any shellfish whatsoever. I heard you. Don't worry. We don't put real clams in the chowder. You don't? What do you put in it? I'll just get dessert. Hey, Bassam, mate, how are you? Bassam. Oh, sorry, mate, yeah. Listen, I meant to ask you about what Coach Starks was saying about your... Cheers. About you never having played in any big tournaments before. - Hey! - Listen... I didn't play in a big tournament because I can't! My government won't let me! The French racists that treat my people like... No... no... no... stop! Bassam, calm down! Calm down! What is going on here? Nothing, I was just... Listen, I was just trying to say that... Whatever you were saying, I probably wouldn't start saying I don't think it was doing the trick, - Just leave it. - Forget him! He'll never understand. - What is going on? - I have no idea. I'm clueless. Do you need to go sit with them? No, no. It'll work out. It'll be all right. Sorry. Forget about that. What's going on tonite? Um, there's a, um, frat party tonight Phi Beta Tau. Ah, okay. Splendid. Sounds good. Yeah. Um, Edward, can I ask you something? Of course girl, anything. What is it? What are you expectations with all this? Sorry, expectations? Yeah. Why do we need to have expectations? Why can't we just be, you know, having a good time? Well, it depends on what you consider a good time. Come on. We're only going to one little party. That's it. All right. (instrumental music playing) Look, take care of this now. The National Minority Championship, the most important invitational of the year shutting you out. On what grounds? On what grounds? You only have one black player on your team. Hold on! It's called the Minority Championship because of minority schools, not the players. The players don't matter! Well, apparently they do. Sorry. Oh, excuse me, sir? Catana Starks, Tennessee State University. I was just wondering-- I read your application personally. The answer is no! Why? What's the reason? The reason, ESPN's breathing down my neck for quotes on a story they're doing about the lack of black golfers in the PGA. They'd have a field day if I let your team into our minority tournament. I could lose my job. Don't you find it interesting that in the 70's, there were ten African Americans on the PGA tour. Today, one, and it's because of the caddy system. What do you mean? Look, there are no African American caddies, okay. The field is dead, so I went with who I could find. Did you even read my application to see where I got these guys from? They're not all white, and these kids did not have a shot anywhere else. But if you want to turn your back on them and shut them out, and me, the only female head coach, well then you do that. But I thought the goal was diversity. Don't do that. It's more complicated than that. It doesn't have to be. You don't get it. I still have to answer to the media! So you tell them the truth, the full story. They're always looking to make it about race anyway. But we all know that it is way deeper than that, isn't it? (instrumental music playing) (doorbell ringing) - Stacey? - Hey, Coach. Can I talk to you for a second. Uh, this couldn't wait for the office? I'm sorry. I... You moved your desk, and I didn't know where you were. That's fine. It's just that I normally don't have students over to my house. I understand. What is it? I wanted to personally come over and tell you that I've already had some great interviews set up, and they're with some good schools. Great. That's...that's great, Stacey. They'd be lucky to have you. Thanks, Coach. I wanted to talk to you about something else too. I haven't had that much experience with guys. Oh, Stacey. Hey look, you're talking to the wrong woman, okay. I only mentioned it to you because of Edward. He... Edward? The British guy? Yeah, Stacey, look. Uh, I'm gonna say this one time. Stay away from him. You got too much of a future. He's no good for you, okay? Focus on med school and let him focus on golf. I just thought he was cute. I wasn't talking about marrying him. Stacey! You're the one that's gonna end up hurt if you let this go on. Good seeing you, okay? Let's do this. How you doing? Hey. (music playing) There was this guy, Ronald Simpson, and he had this trick he'd pull, right? Now, as his opponent was coming up to the back swing, he'd do something. He'd move. He'd cough. He'd say something, right? The opponent would turn around, and he'd apologize profusely. I'm sorry, sorry. I didn't mean it. - I won't do it again. - Right. And then guess what he'd do? Go on. What? Cam, mate, what's wrong with ya? What'd he do? Simpson's statue. Just what I did then, mate. He wouldn't move a muscle, and it was completely unnerving for his opponents. They couldn't get back into the rhythm. Champagne golf, they called it. Cam, I love you to death, mate. I really do, but we need to talk about something other than golf for five minutes. Oh, yeah of course. Absolutely. (music playing) Hey. Who is that? Oh, uh, that's just Bassam, from the golf team. Oh, are you in the frat, too? Too? What do you mean, too? No, I was just telling her how I'm in the fraternity here. What are you talking about? Um, okay, if you're gonna lie to me... No, no, no. Listen, listen, I... He's foreign, okay? He doesn't even know what a fraternity is, and...and who could blame him? Stacey? What's up, girl? I thought you were gonna stand me up. What's going on? - Hey. - What's up? What's wrong? I had a talk with my coach today. Right. What's she got to say? I don't think this is gonna work. Stacey, what are you talking about? Why are you even speaking to Coach? What does she have to say about it? She spends more time with you. She knows you. She doesn't know me! She put you off me! Did she say, "Stay away from him?" No, I mean, I don't think it's gonna work out. Frankie, does this guy even live in the house? Girl, I've never seen this guy a day in my life! - All right, get out! - I'm going. I'm going. Sorry. Hey, don't push me, okay? I just don't get why she has to stick her nose in. All right, you know, like teach us golf, fine. But Stacey, won't even speak to me now, mate. Go get in her face. So true! I'm sick of you talking like you're from the hood. Yo, chill brother. It's cool. No. It...it's not chill. All right, it's not cool. It's all good, Young G. Craig's just mad at you 'cause you're blacker than him. Man, no I'm mad because he acts black without knowing what it means to be black. All right, the struggle. Oh, you don't know the struggle. What did you just say, bro? Try to be an Algerian in France. That's struggle. People dumber, weaker or lazier than me get ahead because they're born to right families, and I wasn't. Hey, hey. Let it go, man. Just let it go. Hang on a second! You cannot be serious right now! Really? We might be in huge trouble because you thought it would be fun to hit someone! We could all be kicked off the team! Golf is all I have, mate. It is it. It is my life. I don't have too much to go home to. And you know what, mate? By the sounds of it, neither do you. Cam, hey you all right, mate? Walk home! Come on. Get up. Get up. (knocking on door) Sit down. - Ken, I really need to-- - Please. Sit down. What's this about your boys at a fraternity? I don't know. Don't give me that. All I know is there was a fight, and one of my guys was involved. - Is he off the team? - No! I don't know anything yet. Well, I thought you were a disciplinarian, Starks. I am a disciplinarian! But Ken, I can't just kick him off the team without having the facts! Look, I really need to go 'cause that one kid's got some serious issues. I need to talk to him, okay? I'm replacing you. What? I'm replacing you at the end of the year. I haven't decided whether or not to let you come back and coach the swim team, but you definitely will not be coaching golf. Ken, please. Look, this team means so much to me. You're not even giving me a chance here. Why? - The fight for one. - But-- Poor leadership. Your recruiting choices, the way you talk to me, and your smug attitude and the way you walk. My smug attitude? You're here because of your daddy, except you're cheap. We didn't have the money, and I suggest you be more careful about how you speak to me. I won't, and we did have the money, but you just wouldn't give it to me. But you know what? None of that matters 'cause you never liked me since day one. Because you're smug and you're arrogant. I am confident. You're done, Starks. After your last tournament, you're gone. I'll do you one better. I'll pack my stuff up and be out tonight. I can't work with you, not like this. But I will finish out the year because I'm dedicated to those boys and my team! You ain't leavin' are you? I can't stay here. What happened? Paulsen's firing me, Roger. He can't do that. He cannot do that without a cause. You...you gonna fight that, aren't you? It's not like he doesn't have grounds. I screwed up, so that might be it. That's my life...gone. Oh no, Catana. You just go home and get you some rest, and everything will sort itself out. You know that. Edward, what are you doing here? Who do you think you are? Telling Stacey who she can and can't be with! Because I'm white, isn't it! You're racist, you know?! Edward, I...I really can't do this with you. Can't do what? Argue with you, but it has nothing to do with race. Why did you tell Stacey that there's no future with me? She's too scared to go out there and enjoy her life 'cause of you! And your work, work, work and join the rat race! Look, I was just... What have you got to show for it? After all your hard work, eh? You ain't never been married! You ain't got no kids! Have you even ever had a boyfriend? (laughing) Oh, this...this is how you choose to live? If this is your idea of making something of yourself, forget it, all right? I'm out! I quit! (crying) (alarm clock ringing) (music playing) Hey. Hey. Mind if I sit? You know, I looked up what your name means in Arabic. Bassam, you're supposed to be a person who smiles. Oh, is that a smile? Huh? Why can't we have that more often? If you understand the Algerian thing, you know why. Your War of Independence was 200 years ago. Ours was less than 50 years. My mother was made an orphan. It's hard to forget. I can imagine... ...but I still don't understand how you can go from being so angry one minute to being so calm the next. In golf? No, just like now, laying here in the grass. I look at you, and I think, "Where does he go?" Where do you go, Bassam? When I was a child... ...my mother said I could be anything I wanted. I didn't know it wasn't true. It was always something in the way, some people or rules or laws saying, "No, not allowed." And instead of looking at the world and seeing pain, I look at the sky. The sky goes on forever, nothing can hold it. In golf, when you aim your shot, what do you see? I get it. When I was growing up, golf was something that happened... ...behind huge walls, tall hedges, you know private places we weren't accepted or allowed. Funny thing is I think we all knew those walls would come down sooner or later, then we'd be left to deal with our own walls. Mind if I borrow the sky sometimes? Not at all. Is Edward around? No. I haven't seen him. But I think he's angry at you. Yeah, we got some business to take care of. C'est la vie, huh? Yeah. - She's my coach. - Yeah, mine too, all right? It doesn't make any difference to me. Edward! Stacey! Look, whatever you're about to say, let's forget it! We're well within our rights to sit here and be together! - I'm not being bullied by you! - Edward. Look, just because you're my coach, doesn't mean you can just swan in... Edward! I'm trying to apologize. What? Look, for better or worse, Stacey and I have history, okay? I coached her from the time she started at TSU through last year. What? So that gives you the right to tell her who she can be with? She asked me my opinion. And what, and you said, "Stay away from Edward. Edward, it is not about you. Then what's it about? Me. It's about me. When I went to college, I was there to work, study and get my degree. That was it. I wasn't there to party, socialize. Of course. But, then I met him. He was gorgeous, and he had a car. (laughing) Yeah, he'd come pick me up and we'd go out to eat and dance and golf. Yeah, golf was our game. So what happened? Well, he was good, was real good. So the guys from the pro tour started calling. I was excited for him. I was just wondering what I'd do with myself when he was gone. So, about a week before he was set to leave, he took me out to play 18. I could barely get through nine. I was too worked up to even focus on a ball much less swing a club. So, we finally get to hole 18, and he has me pull the flag because he needed to putt. Wouldn't you know it? A ring popped out. He was so corny. (laughing) I said, "What about school? I got to finish school." He said, "Don't worry about school. I'm gonna be a professional golf player making millions. You won't have to work." I looked in his eyes... ...and I said I can't. I'm sorry. Why? You...you were in love. That doesn't make any sense at all. Yeah, just the way I was raised, you know? Values I had. My parents. Not being able to stand on your own two feet wasn't an option. So I had to let him go. I just didn't want Stacey to have to go through what I went through. But that's not how it works. And I should've learned that by now. She seems more soft, right? Yeah. Yeah, exactly, mate. I saw her before she saw you, and she didn't try to push, try to be tough. She was really sweet. Yeah, it was a whole other side to her we hadn't seen before. It turns out that golf is the thing that reminds her of the one time in her life that she was truly happy. That's heavy. (phone ringing) Yeah, it was, mate, knocked me for six. - I got it. - I went from wanting to bite her head off to wanting to give her a cuddle and saying it's gonna be all right. Yeah, Coach. Sure thing. That was Starks. She said that practice is off, but she wants to have a team meeting at her house on Thursday night. - Dinner... - At her house? That's what she said. (doorbell ringing) - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Come in. Wow, Coach. Make yourself at home. You scrub up all right, Coach. Thank you. - You look so good. - Thank you. So, um, I hope you don't mind pasta 'cause I'm not really much of a cook. That's good. That'll be fine. I like marinara. CATANA: So, is everybody full? Yeah. Thank you so much. You don't have to lie if it was nasty. (laughing) No, no. It was really good. Brilliant. Thank you. Hey, guys. After our conversation, Bassam, you got me to thinking about a lot of things. What do you mean? Well, you know, about golf, life, those big walls. Anyway, I've had a lot of time to think about things lately; ever since I lost my job. You...you what? You what? Wait, you never told me that. Because of the fight? No...no, let me clarify. Um, I'm still the coach for now, but next year... Hang on. You can't be serious. You can't leave. Cameron, if it were up to me, I wouldn't be. Believe me. I take this job very seriously. It's my life. I'm so embarrassed to say this, but up until now, my job is all I've had. There's this idea in this country that if you aren't working or pushing 24/7, well then you're wasting your time. And I don't believe that anymore. I don't think life should just be about work, work, work. But we can still work there. I mean, we can still play golf? Yes, Cameron, yes. But I think it should be fun. Yeah, just to clarify. Um, we're gonna...we're gonna play out the year, right? Oh, Cameron, yes. We're gonna play out the rest of the year, and this is how we're gonna do it. Okay, first we're up early. Get all the practice we can... Why is that foot back? ...but focus on your schoolwork too. You can be great students or at least pretty good students. I want you to meet new people, and I want you to care for one another like brothers, like a real team. And maybe squeeze in one more practice before bed just because. If you ever felt like other players were more prepared than you, throw that excuse right out the window. And if we can just keep playing our game doing our thing you'll give me some good memories to go out on. What is the point of this? I said we were playing from the rough. You didn't think I was talking about tall grass, did you? What are we doing? (instrumental music playing) Oh! And finally, our men's golf team has placed in the top three in its last two tournaments and can finish strong at the National Minority Championship. They got the invitation, and it's this weekend. All right. Good. That means Starks gets a big fat raise, doesn't she? Roger, don't you ever go home? Oh, no, way too hot in the house. But you guys don't mind me. I'll be out you guys' hair in a second. Got to get the trash. As for, uh, Starks, unfortunately, I've decided not to retain her for the coming year. - What? - Why? There are many reasons. First, despite the cost, she recruited almost all of her players out of the country, and she kept making budget demands. There were disciplinary issues... ...and she didn't work well with the administration. - You, in other words. - Yes, me. I'm the one in charge. Paulsen, when I said our program was a mess, I wasn't talking about Starks. Now, she's our one bright spot, has been for years. Where do you get the nerves to make a move like that? It's complicated. Complicated? Are you kidding me? Fire Starks? Young man, what were you thinking? Hey, how'd your meeting go? Oh, it's like that? Everybody thinks I'm some rich guy who got this job because I had connections! I didn't! I had a career before this! I've run businesses! I managed hundreds of employees! But here, no one will give me credit for anything! It's not about credit, Ken, it's about respect. Respect? Don't tell me about respect! All my life I've done everything everybody wanted me to do! You try walking a mile in my shoes! I might not have walked in your shoes, but I know what you stepped in 'cause it's my job to clean it. So if anybody should be complaining, it's me. But if you noticed, I'm not. Yeah, and I don't understand that, Roger. I mean, your stats were better than mine and here you are. You could do anything you wanted to on the field. The field? Listen to yourself, Ken! We spend most of our time in this country on somebody's field. First cotton and tobacco, now sports. At some point, the respect we seek has to come from us, not our performance on somebody's field. Nobody gets to tell me what I'm worth but me. Well, it's easy for you, Roger. 'Cause everybody here likes you, and they love Starks. Of course they do! Let's look at what she's done. She's coaching a sport nobody wanted, players nobody wanted. Come on, man. If you're so wrapped up in your own thing you can't see it, I don't know what to tell you. But if you really want respect, how about you give some where it's due? (horn honking) Come on, fellas! We want to get there early! All right. Good day, Coach! Hey. (laughing) - Hey. - Hey. - Morning. - Hello. Hey. Uh, what happened to Young G? I'm Ji-Kyung this weekend. My dad's coming. You look so handsome. Oh yeah. (music playing) Cam, is it me mate or are we the... ...only white people at the golf tournament? Yeah, mate, apparently. First time for everything, huh? Okay, listen up. Black and white striped shirts. That's who we're paired with, Brantley State. You see the guy with the dreads? Well he turned me down. He laughed at me. So did the one beside him and that other one wouldn't even shake my hand. I want to beat them so bad. You hear me? Yeah. Oh, Shawn Howard at the top of the steps. The one I told you about, the next Tiger Woods. He looks better. And we can beat him. Stop staring. Let's go. Get your clubs. (instrumental music playing) You looking for your dad? Yeah. He'll show up. - Ready? - Yeah. Oh man. What'd you do to your hair? I did this for you. I dyed mine black. It's a paint. I'm down for you. - I got to get back to my team. - Go get 'em. I'll see you at the next hole. (instrumental music playing) I bet you 50, he misses. Oh. At the end of game one, Shawn Howard has led the heavily favored Brantley State University to the top of the leader board. You know, I can't say that I would've done anything like this in the past. Probably would've gone somewhere cheap to talk strategy. But I figured, a nice meal couldn't hurt. - Thanks, Coach. - You're welcome. They only take the top four scores out of the five so, you don't all have to be perfect, but I would like to remember you all playing to your full potential like I said we would. Yes, ma'am. - Definitely. - Yes, Coach. Okay. What do I do? Craig, let's try to figure this out. You talk yourself out of things. You're in your own way. Talk it through. Try this. It's good. Oh yeah? What is it? I don't know. I'm French. I'm not Italian. Oh. So now he's French. Did you hear that everyone? Eat your food, Edward. (indiscreet chatter) (choking) - What happened? - I don't know. He was eating my food, and then... What was he eating? What were you eating? Call 911 somebody! Now! - How you feeling, mate? - Hey, mate. Ironic all of this, isn't it? What's that? Australia's nothing but shellfish. What's the, uh...what's it called, the Great Barrier Reef? I don't snorkel, mate. Hey, guys. Oh, hey Coach. So, uh, I'm all good. I can play tomorrow? I'm afraid not, Cameron. Oh, no, no, Coach. I'm good. I'll be able to play. I'm sorry. CATANA: Now, we really have to bring our best since they just can't take the top scores. Every one counts, okay? - Ooh, look at those shoes. - You like those? Please don't tell me you stole those? Of course not. My mom sent them to me, all right? She's proud. It's the first big tournament and everything. Oh, wait, your mom? I thought you were, uh, from the streets? (laughing) We've all got a mom, eh mate? That was a good one. You Craig? Uh, yes. I'm Shawn. You with me today. Is that how you shake hands? I really hope you grip your club better than that. You good? Shawn Howard just shook my hand. I'm facing him? Get out there and you face him. Yeah. SHAWN: So who'd she recruit first? I don't...I don't know. I...uh...I tried out, made the team and then she found the rest. So there were no good golfers at your college so she went international? I see why. You know, I just realized something. I looked at your team's information. It said you from just outside of Atlanta. You're Craig, right? Uh, yeah. One of my teammates said he had a great caddy... ...said the kid always wanted to be the first person from his family to go to college. So when Tennessee State accepted him, he was excited. It's you, isn't it? The caddy? Yeah, man, yeah. Well, at the end of the day, I hope I can get another handshake from you 'cause I would hate to have to go to the back and tell everybody else that Craig, the caddy, has a weak grip. I'm...I'm sorry. I can't do this. I can't straighten out my game, and he just keeps talking it. Who? Shawn Howard? Shawn's been playing golf since he was three years old. His family has poured more money into him playing golf than we've all seen in our entire lives! He needs to talk himself up. He's scared of you. - He's not. - Yeah, he is. Craig, look at me! This is the big time. I never had the chance before, but now I do because of this team, and you're part of this team. A big part! - Yes! - Come on! Craig, Mate. Start believing in yourself. As soon as you realize that, the sooner you'll realize you have got everything inside you it takes to beat this guy. I know it. We all know it. You got this, brother. You got this. Yes. (laughing) - Come on. - He's right, man. - You got this. - Come on. You can do it. Ready to win this? Absolutely. Let's go. (music playing) What? What is that? Uh, I don't know. Just the ones we got. Look like they got that out of a shed somewhere. Right, well they, uh, they did. (cheering) You're not gonna let us lose to my caddy, are you? Did you close your eyes? Just like you taught me. Like I taught you to do in practice. Not in a game. Are you crazy? Hey, what's the score? He gets this, we tie. We go to a playoff. Shh! (coughing) I'm trying to shoot over here. I'm sorry, mate. I'm really sorry. (clears throat) It won't happen again. I'm sorry. (clears throat) How about you do me a favor and stop doing that? - Me? - Yeah, you! Stop doing that! I'm not doing anything, mate. - Exactly! - Hold on now, mate. - Hey, hey! - Calm down. - Relax. (crowd gasps) (cheering) Ladies and gentlemen, the National Collegiate Minority Championship winners, Catana Starks and the Tennessee State men's golf team! (cheering) What are you doing? Just give me a minute. I need to say something. My name is Kendrick Paulsen, Jr. I'm the athletic director at Tennessee State University, and this trophy is something that we will treasure at TSU for a very long time. Coach Starks here, has done some truly amazing things with this team, and I'm honored for having had the opportunity to work with her. Go Coach! My father wanted me to go to TSU because he wanted me to learn the things that he learned, and to be around people who know what it means to roll up their sleeves, to work hard and to never quit. I couldn't have asked for a better example... than Catana Starks. Congratulations, Coach. Thank you. Thank you. - Here. - No. You've earned it. (music playing)
