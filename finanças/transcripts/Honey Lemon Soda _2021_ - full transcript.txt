Thank goodness. I'm sorry. Tomoya, here! Kai! Shoot! [ April Goal: Say good morning!] Huh? It's Stone. Stone! I thought you were going to Shinsei Academy. You failed? Who's she? Who's this average girl? Back in middle school, she's like, what, a stone? What the hell, a stone? No, it's stone because she doesn't move. - So it's like that. - Yeah, yeah. Bye, Stone. Bye-bye. [ Garbage collection point ] Stone! You picking on trash? You poor thing. You find a good pair? - Yes, she did. - She found one. I hope it's just that thing. God, it's so funny... Do something about it. I'm sorry. Huh? It's still the same as before, nothing special. You're not gonna fight back? It's better to be a stone. You should tell someone. Ask for help. Who should I ask? You. What do you think you are? I am... a stone. How about some burgers? Ouch. Oh, no. She turned to stone outside. You're the worst. You're taking an extrance exam for Shinsei? You'll fit right in there. Such a tacky uniform. That was really good. Let's go. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. This is yours, isn't it? There is no place for me. Same for me. Doesn't this look better on you? Well... I'm going there too. I want to change. Me too. Hey, Stone. I'm starving. Get me something. I'll have the weiner roll. Hey. Go! Huh? What do you think you're doing? Seriously, you make me sick. What are you doing? Come on. Say it like yesterday. This again. It's annoying. Okay. I... I... need... I need your help. Good job. Next time you do something to her, I won't forgive you. Let's go. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. When you need help, call me and I will come flying. You see, I can fly. Thank you. Huh? Are these cherries? Yeah. It's cute. - "It's cute". - Stop it. Come eat with us, Ishimori. Shall we? Come on, let's eat? I'd love to. Here, here. - Come in. - Pardon me. Excuse me. It's my first time doing this. Ah! Cute people have cute lunch boxes too, huh? No, I don't think so. Because your lunch box... What!? Is that a vegetarian dish? Or are you on a diet? - You idiot! - Ouch! - Sorry. - Sorry. No, it's okay. By the way, why did you come to this high school? What? Satoru! Because she's extremely smart. I'm curious, too. Right? Umm... I yearned for it. Yearn? When I was in junior high, I was bullied. I didn't have any friends, and I never really enjoyed school. If I thought of myself as a stone, I wouldn't get hurt. But... someone made me realize. I... really want to change. And so I was sure that I could have a normal high school life at this school. A normal high school life? Yes. I have a dream. That my friends and I would take a detour after school, and we would just talk and not go home until we're satisfied. - Maybe have a sleepover, right? - Yes! A normal high school life. Hey, let's eat. Let's eat. [ Seating change Lottery box ] It's the same. Oh, we're neighbors, Ayumi. How lucky. I guess we're neighbors. I'm so sorry... Stop apologizing every time. It's annoying. - I'm... - Huh!? I'm so... You kidding me? No, I'm not. Why are caving like that? - I don't know. - You're the one who said it. Kai is Ishimori's caretaker. Please treat him well. Ishimori, you're an honor student. Wanna change seats? No need to change. She's not just an honor student, she's actually amazing. Maybe it would be nice to get along. Let's get along. Ishimori! - Let's be friends! - Let's be friends! What's the right thing to do? That's fine for now. Slowly get used to the class. Don't embarrass yourself by me saying you're amazing. I'll be right next to you. I wonder if you can make 100 friends. I can! You said it. Yes, I did. Ishimori? What's wrong? - Endo! - Yes? Be my friend, please! Are we not friends already? Really? I see! I have to tell you about these things. We are friends. Yes. You're quite obedient, aren't you, to Ishimori? She was lost, and I called out to her. She became attached to me beyond that. Like a chick who sees its parents for the first time. Well... You were the only one who called out that girl. That's all she is, nothing more, nothing less. You see Ishimori as a love interest. No, I don't. [ May Goal: Make 100 friends! ] When you need help, call me and I will come flying. You see, I can fly. Kai! [ Equipment Storage ] I'm coming in! Why are you here? No, I... I'm sor... First time I was found. That's amazing. What... are you doing here? Napping. It's kind of calming, isn't it? This place. I think it's dusty. No. This kind of place is closest to the real me. The past you is the reason why you are here now. Which is really you. What you said the other day. It's trivial. It's a small dream. I'll make all of that come true easily for you. Why? Because I am in charge of you, Ishimori. Kai, where have you been? He would never tell us where. Ishimori, where was Kai? Hey, Uka-chin. Huh? Are you thinking about Kai? I'll do my best to support you. Well, it might be a little tough. I know. What about you, Ayumi? With Seto. It's that obvious? You're dating, right? Not at all. It's completely unrequited. I'll do my best to support you too, Ayumi. Thank you. [ July Goal: Everyone pass the final test! ] Ishimori! Hello. I'm sorry you're spending your vacation studying with us. Totally fine. Anything I can do for you in return? Ah, you know. For your small dreams. There is. What? That one. [ Bamboo Lantern Festival ] But... Yeah. Okay. Thank you. It must be hard for you, Uka-chin, with all of us. No, not at all. But I will get a 100, right? Ayumi! Serina! Everyone is here. Our different classes don't meet at all. Yeah. Serina, isn't that your ex? Hey! Hey, hey, Miura. Why did you and Serina broke up? Shut up. I'm sorry, Serina. We're going home first. Wait, we're leaving the store? No choice. Hey, who's this girl? She's not part of this group, is she? No, of course not. Seriously? Stop. Are you aware? - You're pathetic to look at. - I said stop. Hey! I told you to stop it! Let's go. This is bullshit! Everyone. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go too. Hey! Thank you. No. I'm really sorry. Don't mind those girls, okay? You're Uka, right? Let's talk again. I'm sorry. Bye. Serina's the same as always. Serina's been with us four since middle school. Serina was the only one who left our class. Let's go? Let's go! Let's head back. Hey. Serina, You got a little carried away. Anyway, apologize for yesterday. Which one of us got carried away? Then... go be with your lame ass friends! - Kanno! Kanno was only defending me. Huh? What did you say? Speak up! The lame ass Ishimori is pissed off. Are you aware? You're pathetic to look at. Call me next time, Serina. No... I'm fine. You're not fine. I'm fine, really. Uka-chin, are you listening? What? Sorry, what was that? Are you worried about Serina? It's not about Serina. You know, I don't always know what Kai is thinking. But he thinks about everyone more than anyone else. Yeah. Ayumi! Uka! Kai, you didn't come over the other day. I always don't. No, it was Saturday night. I didn't call you cause I was worried. Kai, did you get back together with Serina? Satoru! You don't get it, Satoru. Huh!? He can only protect one of them consistently. Well, it's causing misunderstandings on each side. What!? What does that mean? I'm going home. Huh? Kai! I'm going home. I'm sorry about my friends. No, no. It's really okay. I'm sorry too, Kanno. You can call me Serina. Yes. By the way, that was amazing, Uka. No. My body just moved on its own. I'm not like you at all, Serina. That's not true. Serina, you're strong and such a nice person. I've been through a lot. Are you talking about eight grade? Look. We were in the same class in ninth grade, and I didn't know her very well, but Serina was... [ Disgusting. Don't get carried away! Die! ] [ Annoying. Drop dead. ] At that time, the one who protected me was Kai. I was so happy. And just like that, Kai was the only one I needed. That's how I came to think of it. Before I knew it, I became more dependent on Kai than I thought. Uka, that's why I'm not strong at-- - Serina. Do you... ...still love Miura? No. I don't love him. Not any more. You're not good at lying, Serina. Wait, I'm not lying. Because you love Kai too. I... have nothing to do with Kai anymore. That's why Uka... I love him. But that's because I respect and admire him. he's special to me, but only as that. So... it's not love or anything like that Ishimori! Ishimori! Okay. Tomorrow is summer vacation, but don't take too much sweets. This concludes the first semester. Miura. See you next semester. [ Bamboo Lantern Festival ] [ August Goal: Go to a summer festival! ] What do you wanna do? What do you wanna eat? Come on, Uka-chin. We've come all this way, it'll be fun. - Ayumi. - Yes? Are you worried about me? Today it's just us two. Let's chat a lot about love. You really wanted Seto to come, didn't you? You gonna shut up and watch? Even if you tell me that you still love Kai now, it will only make you suffer more Ayumi. If it gets too hard, just let me know. AH! Ayumi! I finally found you, I've been looking everywhere! Satoru, I told you to leave just us alone for today. Come on, just include me too. Read the room, man! Uka! Excuse me for a second. Hello. Huh? Where's Kai? Huh? Ah, no... I thought maybe he was going with you, Serina. Kai won't come for me. What? Why? Because you're here. I'm sure he's looking for you right now. Serina. - Let's get going. - Okay. See you around. Ishimori. Wait! I've been looking for you. Why are you running away? Going home? Then I'll take you home. I'm fine. Please let go of me. If you don't want me, then say it. I don't like it. Please let go of me. You suck at lying, Ishimori. Why did you say see you next semester? Are you planning on never seeing us again? I went to invite you today, but Ayumi beat me to it. Why someone like me? I told you to stop doing that. You. Do you still think of yourself as a stone? Yes. It's fine being a stone.

I... really love Miura... I'm glad you said it. I'll stop holding on to him too. So stop it, Uka. I want you to love Kai, fair and square. Thank God! Ayumi? What? Why? BEACH! Miura. Thank you very much. What? If it weren't for you, I'm sure I would have never done things like going to the beach. So what about this winter? This Christmas, I'd like to have a party with everyone. That'd be nice. Get up. Kai smiles a lot in front of Ishimori, doesn't he? Is it frustrating? Tomoya. As always, you piss me off. The truth is, I've known all along, but I pretended not to notice. But I can't just stand in the same place anymore, can I? Serina. Hmm? Out of all the girls I've seen, Serina, you're the coolest. Thank you. Hey. Sorry, it's sudden. Listen. What I'm going to say I'm sure you already know it. I... I still love you, Kai. Kai, I don't know what you're thinking. That's why I misunderstood you. Before, you tried to protect me in front of my friends, didn't you? At that time, I was trying to prevent Uka from getting involved. When I was in junior high, being with you made me very weak. Now Uka is stronger. For the last time, I'm going to ask you something I was afraid to ask you back then. Kai... Did you love me? I did love you. But... When you tried to leave, I couldn't stop you. That's my answer. I know. Idiot! I'm gonna go home now. Thank you, Kai. And... I can finally give up on you. When Kai and Serina are back, let's clean up and go home. Good luck cleaning it up, Tomoya. Why me? We all do it. The beach was nice. Yes, it is. Maybe in spring again. I have given up on Kai for good. I'm glad he's with you, Uka! Serina, thank you for the text. I may have made you feel constricted by worrying too much about the two of you even though I had nothing... I was so focused on myself that I didn't pay... What happened with you and Miura, I'm just so surprised and I don't know why... Too long. - We'll be going this way. - Oh, I see. - Bye. See ya! - Bye! - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Let's go. - Yeah. Kai. You said before that you don't consider Ishimori as a love interest. Wouldn't it be bad if you took it seriously? I've said it before, but I'm taking it back. It's done... Hey. Good morning, Uka. Good morning. How'd it go with you and Kai? Have you done it? Nothing happened. What about his contact info? No, I still don't have it. It's not good for your health if you always eat bread, if you'd like. Here. Thank you. It's good. I'm glad you like it. You're not being bullied anymore. I had forgotten that I was being bullied. You've gotten stronger. No. Because I was so busy chasing after you, Miura. I see. Wake me when the bell rings. What is it? {\pos(962,966.269)}I was thinking that you live by your own rules. The wrong rules, right? Even if there is a correct rule as the world calls it, I'll follow your rule, Miura. Am I a god? I'm just a damn kid. Do you have a girlfriend, Kai? I don't deserve to be in love. Again. [ Identication Document ] [ Totsuka Ward, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture 6235-501 Totsukacho ] Miura! What? You weren't at school. Miura? Miura? Are you okay? Why are you here? Today, you didn't come to school, {\pos(960,963.61)}so I got worried. And... Sorry. I took the liberty of looking. No. You saved me. Thank you. I borrowed your kitchen without asking. I made sweet potato porridge. Would you like some? It's hard to eat. Did you like it? Yes, it's delicious. Thank goodness. Does your family always come home late? They're overseas right now. Oh, I see. I'd hate for you to collapse like that again... So if possible, can I have your contact information? You finally asked.

No, I'm coming! - You're in a lot of pain, right? - I've missed you. - Kai, are you listening? - He's not listening. Maybe the popular Kai is making Ishimori feel uneasy. Huh? You mean it's my fault? Well, Kai is popular. They just thought that anyone other than themselves would be fine but they misunderstood it. What does that mean? It's okay if you don't know. Miura. About today... I think... Kai, let's go. - Let's go home together. - Let's get out of here. I can't. I have plans today. How... How long are you gonna be with me? Until graduation. You think it's going to stay that way? This is the notebook I borrowed. I'll go home now. You're still not confident? Everyone surrounds Miura no matter what. They were content just to be near Miura. I've always thought so. Uka.

[ I need you, Ishimori ] Uka-chin. If Kai found someone he loved, would you support him? Can you? I may not be able to. If you could go out with him, how would you feel? I'd be very happy. Yeah. Uka-chin. You don't have to hold anything back anymore. It's okay to be more greedy. You are working much harder than you think you are. So go ahead and move forward. G--Go-Good morning! Are you a parrot? I need your help. Good job. What you said the other day. It's a small dream. I'll make all of that come true easily for you. Because I am in charge of you, Ishimori. You may be a stone, but you're a jewel. Sorry, I'm late. I'm sorry. It's okay. Are you sure you want to be here? I wanted to come here. Once again. I told you it looked good on you. That uniform. Doesn't this look better on you? You remembered that? Maybe since that day I've become in charge of you, Ishimori. I love you. Miura... I love you. I wanna be your girlfriend, Miura. I love... I love you too. Ishimori. Good morning... Good morning. Are you waiting for someone? Who else would it be but you? No way. No way. No, no way. That's Ishimori, right? It's not normal at all. What is going on? - They don't look like friends at all. - I'm not really seeing this, right? We're not just friends. I'll say it in front of you. She's my girlfriend. Hey. - H-Hey. - What is it? I've made something like this. [ What is your favorite season? What sports are you good at? ] If I could fill in all of these, maybe I could get a little closer to you. I'm sorry. It's weird, isn't it? One per day. Thank you very much! So, today's question is... What is your favorite season? I won't tell you. Why not? Wait a minute. - What is your favorite hairstyle? - I won't tell you. Is it blond hair? Is it black hair? Do you use hairpin? - Where do you go to buy things? - Maybe in front of the station. - So what kind of clothes do you like? - Patterned shirts and jeans. Miura, it's too much! - What do you mean "too much"? - I mean it's a lot. That's not it. What are you listening to now? - Here, listen. - Ah! I love this! - Right? - What's your favorite food? - Chinese food, I guess. - Especially? - Why you saying it like that? - Please tell me quickly. Moyashi soba, gyoza and tea. Oh, you eat a lot. - Well. - Please don't get fat, okay? Stupid! What is your least favorite subject? - Math. - I'm good at it, so I'll teach you. - I got 20 points the last time. - Let's go for 60. Can I just get 40 points? If you give up, that's the end for you. - Okay, Teacher. - Yes. Why did you call me "Teacher"? What is your favorite side dish for lunch? I love rolled omelets, lots and lots of them. Yes! - Ready? Ta-da! - Ready? Ta-da! Isn't that amazing? Who is your favorite YouTuber? This one. Right? What's your favorite drink? - That would be... - Yes, yes, I know! - Let's say it together? - Such a hassle. Okay, let's go. Ready? - Lemon soda! - Lemon soda float. Sneaky. What is your special skill? Huh? Miura? Oh, right. - Where's your favorite place? - Right here. The beach! - Right here. - Red brick! - Right here. - Chinatown! Too sweet! What's this? Tuncaroon. Tuncaroon? This one's your favorite, right? I just wanted to try some. How many more of these? One per day. 365 of them for one year. That's how long I am going to be with you. You really love me, huh? [ What is your family structure? ] What's wrong? Nothing. I brought you lunch. Not today. Am I bothering you by any chance? Not really. Today, after school. Ayumi and the others and I are going to plan the Christmas party. I've got things to do today. Sorry. Uka-chin's acting strange lately, right? I thought so, too. Really? They don't seem to be fighting or anything, but there's some kind of invisible wall. I hope Uka is okay. I've got an idea. Then let's invite Kai and go Christmas shopping together. Oh, that's nice. Wouldn't it be fun to decorate it together? Where should we go? The Terrace Mall has everything. You bought too much. That's right! - Let's all exchange gifts. - Great idea! - Up to 1,000 yen per person. - 1,000 yen? - Up to 1,000 yen. - 1,000 yen? What? What should I get? - Is 2,000 yen much better? - No, no. Kai! It really is you, Kai. What a surprise. Are you going to go to the bar after this? Yes. See you later. Thank you. W-What!? Who's she? She's nothing. She's not nothing. I told you she's nothing. Explain it to Uka-chin. It's none of your business. Stop acting so cool! Hey. This afternoon, I don't think Ayumi had any bad intentions. I know that. Are we done here? Hey, Kai! We all just love you. Good morning, Kobayashi. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. I'm sorry. Me too. I'm sorry. From your point of view, Takamine, did I do something wrong to Miura? I don't really know, either. Right. If you hadn't applied to this school, and hadn't met Kai, I wonder what your days would have been like. What? If being together with him is causing problems that don't need to be angry about, then I'm not sure you should really be with him. I want to be with him. If you know something about Miura, please tell me. He might not like it. Still, I want you to tell me. Why was that guy so attracted to you? I think I've figured it out somehow. Hey, you, what are you doing after this? Hey, Kai, I need a refill! Huh? Wait, wait, wait. Are you Kai's girlfriend? I'm sorry. Kai is mine. Where are you going? What the hell are you doing here? Why are you keeping this a secret? - You're not doing anything wrong. - You shouldn't be here. I won't know anything unless you tell me. My world is really over here. No matter what world you're in, is it wrong for me to want to get to know you, Miura? Go home. Miura! [ Equipment Storage ] [ Off Limit ] The storage room has been closed. Miura. Ishimori. Tell me what sort of a person I am. You're responsible, caring, tough, kind, and strong. Believing that and seeing you admiring that sometimes it pains me. And... you've got a lot going on, and you're delicate. Don't you ever come into my heart again. - Thanks. - Okay, let's do it. - Okay... - Yeah, yeah. - Merry... Christmas! - Christmas! Ah, let's toast! - Let's have a toast. - Cheers! What's this? Kai. Let's go out to dinner later, my treat. No, it's okay. Then what's your favorite food? So do you know what it is? Please tell me. Tuncaroon. I've heard about it. What was it like? Let's see. [ We ate Tuncaroons together! ] [ We stopped at the beach on the way home from school. ] [ Miura's favorite place ] Lemon soda float, yum! Miura's favorite drink! Miura overslept today. Miura ate a lot. Kai, what's wrong? - Whose turn is it? - Not me. Not me either. It's Tomoya's turn! [ Miura ate a lot ] Where's Ishimori? I won't tell you if you're just gonna hurt Uka-chin any more. I'm sorry. I'm sorry everyone. I could never talk about myself. It was hard for me to join in today. Like I was running away. You know Kai, you're such a coward when it matters. He hasn't changed since we were kids. Uka-chin might be getting tired of you. Still... But still, there's something I have to say to her. Uka said there is a place she really wants to go. We have no idea where it is. Here! Take my bicycle. - Okay, shall we go home too? - Yeah. You're right, - You're going home? - Wait! - Hold on just a second. - Satoru! When will you get up the nerve, Satoru? Huh? Never let go of something that's important to you. Huh? What do you mean? - Bye. - Bye. They really went home. What were they talking about? What's the matter? Listen, Satoru. If I told you that I have a boyfriend, what would you do? I don't want that. Really? Of course. Ayumi is my... "My"? My childhood friend. Jerk. I'm going home. Sorry, I lied. Since kindergarten, you were my first love. You were my first too. If I thought of myself as a stone, I wouldn't get hurt. But... someone made me realize. I... really want to change. I had forgotten that I was being bullied. You've gotten stronger. No. Because I was so busy chasing after you, Miura. I will rush to you from now on. - Wherever I am? - Yes! I can fly, too. I want to change. Me too. I love you. Miura... I love you. Miura! I went to the karaoke, but you weren't there. If... you're struggling with something, Miura, I decided to just wait. Because I am in charge of you, Miura. [ What is your family structure? ] [ Mother: Died when he was 3 ] [ Father: Disappeared at the end of ninth grade ] [ He currently lives alone ] I'm sorry I didn't tell you. If I told the truth, I thought the people I love would leave me again. I... got scared. I... will always be with you, Miura. Ishimori, you really have gotten stronger. I thought I was protecting you, but before I knew it, you were protecting me. But I still want to protect you. Ishimori. I love you, Ishimori. Miura. I love you. I really love you! Ever since we met that day at this place. Someone stubbornly stepped in front of you, and that person was me. Uka, I love you. I love you too. Raul Ai Yoshikawa Mayu Hotta / Ryota Bando Natsumi Okamoto / Tatsuomi Hamada [ There's more! Heart fluttering scene ] Uka-chin, you look good in a ponytail. - Yeah. It's cute. - Thank you. [ Do you like ponytails? ] Ayumi. Do this hairstyle again. Did he like it, Uka-chin? I mean... I like it. [ What type does Uka like? ] What type of person is your type, Uka? I'm curious too. Not much of a talker. Very mature. Oh, has one ear pierced... That's the kind of person I like. You mean me? [ Blond or black hair? ] Can I ask you something?
