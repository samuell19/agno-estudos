[ Woman ] "Even after five years, I do." [ Man ] Shall I have it delivered tomorrow, Mrs. Kenyon? No, thank you. It's an anniversary gift for my husband. I want to give it to him tonight. If you will wait just a minute, Mrs. Kenyon, I will have it wrapped up for you. Thank you. Can I be of service, sir? I've only got two minutes. I've got to get a gift for a pal of mine. Something for his wife. Step this way, please. He almost forgot his wedding anniversary. It caught up with him. He's gonna be tied up all day. Told me he had an account here. His name is Tony Kenyon. I've got to scare up some sort of a bangle for him. Well. These clips are very popular. Okay. Give me one. Oh, I shouldn't like the responsibility. Okay, okay. Eeny meeny miny mo. Mmm. They're kind of pretty. How much? [ Salesman ] $2,100. 2,100 smackeroos? Okay. What am I worried about? It's his dough. Wouldn't you like it engraved, sir? Oh, yeah. Let's see, how's about, uh, "Happy fifth anniversary"? You think so, sir? No. You're right. Why be reminded of it every time you wear it? What about... "To my beloved wife"? No. He's probably saving that one for her tombstone. How about-- How's about-- Go ahead. Shoot. "To Lydia. With love, Tony." That's simple. It's quite refined. Does it say enough? Doesn't it say everything? Yeah. What more can you say to a wife after five years on the back of a clip? Okay, have it ready by 5:00. I'll pick it up on my way home. Oh, may I see my gift? Mrs. Kenyon. Oh, it's lovely. It's much too expensive. I'm sorry, madam. If anything I said offended madam-- No. No, but let this be our secret, hmm? Of course, madam. Now you just put this away and show me some other doodads. [ Whimpers ] [ Man ] Thank you, Butch. [ Whimpers ] Oh, Theodore, have you hidden... all the Luckys, Chesterfields and Camels? Yes, madame. I always remember that when we have guests, Red Wing Cigarettes is one of Mr. Kenyon's largest clients. 300,000 a year in advertising. [ Chuckles ] And Abercrombie Soap in all the bathrooms? Yes, madame. "The useful little cake in the lavender wrapper." Now what do you suppose we can do about Vantine's Dog Food? We can't just put it on the piano with a sign saying "Help yourself," can we? That might be a little obvious, don't you think? [ Horn Honking ] Oh! There's Mr. Kenyon. Oh, Theodore, wh-where can I put this? What is it, madame? It's an anniversary gift for Mr. Kenyon. I want to put it somewhere so he can pick it up accidentally. Perhaps on the evening paper. He always goes straight for the paper. Yes. That's wonderful thinking. Theodore, have you put Abercrombie Soap in all the bathrooms? Yes, madame. "The useful little cake in the lavender wrapper." "Little lavender cake in the convenient wrapper." Hello. [ Loud Kiss ] [ Chuckles ] Well, how does it feel to be married to a mug like me for five years? I think I'm gonna like it. Well, don't let me rush you, baby. Just take your time. Oh, darling. Say, you look tired. I am. I finally got that new Vantine campaign lined up. That means an extra million in advertising for the firm. Well, that's wonderful. Darling, why don't you sit down? I wish I had a better slogan for this cockeyed dog food, though. I've got to get him to okay the deal tonight. Well, that's what parties are for, aren't they? Oh, darling, please. When you're a kid, you go to parties for ice cream. When you're a young girl, you go to play post office. But when you've been married five years, well, you have to close a deal. Oh, I'm sorry about it, sweet. Really. I know you are. That's why I put up with it. I wonder where the evening paper is? Hmm? You know, this Vantine is a funny duck. But I think we can work the deal if we can handle Myrtle Vantine. You know what she wears under her skirts, don't you? Yep. Her husband's pants. Right. Never any matches around here. They're right there, darling. See? Can't find any. Here, darling. Say, how have you been getting along with Myrtle Vantine lately? Oh, so-so. She unbends once in a while and calls me "deary." I remember the last time she was at the house, she was sitting there... and Mr. Vantine was sitting right there. What did they talk about? Do you remember? Well, word for word? Well, sitting right there, Mr. Van-- Look, darling, I don't care where he sat. Just what he said. That's all. He said, "My dear Mrs. Kenyon, you have a wonderful cook." And then he burped. May mean a lot. Oh. There's the paper. We're running full-page ads today. Mmm. Mmm. ♪♪ [ Humming ] ♪♪ [ Humming Continues ] Darling. Mm-hmm? You like my new hat? [ Chuckles ] Next thing you know, they'll be wearing things like that. Ah. [ Sighs ] Tony, wouldn't it be nice to sort of have an album history of our marriage? You know, old snapshots and letters and souvenirs. Mm-hmm. You haven't heard a word I said. Mm-hmm. A hippopotamus walked in and sat right on my knee. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Mmm. Suddenly I find myself with a ball in my arms. We were using the old "T" formation. It was a quick opening play through tackle. My interference was mousetrapped. I flashed around end, gave the secondary my hips-- [ Soft Chuckle ] The safety man lunged and straight-armed me. Ah, I straight-armed him right back. Boy, the crowd screamed. I sprinted across that last white line. Hooray! Touchdown! Mm-hmm. Okay. Hey. What's this? Oh, that? Why, I never saw it before in my life. Let's take a look. [ Chuckles Softly ] You looked pretty cute then. Well, what's the matter with me now? [ Sighs ] That's the sort of thing that makes a girl feel feminine all over again. You're feminine all over. What's that? [ Lydia ] A Fifth Avenue bus. Vintage five years ago. Just a bus? Ah, perhaps you don't recall, darling, but we picked each other up on the top of a bus. Oh. [ Chuckles Softly ] Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting. It was a case of love at first sight. [ Laughs ] It was a case of love... because I had second sight. Where in the world did you get that? From your own trembling hand. "Dear sir, we regret that we are compelled... to dispose with your services as of today." December 22. Swell Christmas present, wasn't it? Terrific. But you know, in some ways, it was one of the loveliest Christmases I've ever had. What, with me out of a job? Thoroughly licked? Not a dollar in the house? Practically weeping on your bosom? I loved it. Now, if you want a laugh, how would you like to read some of your old love letters? Oh. Are they that funny? Tony, they are corny but beautiful. Mmm. They get better further down. [ Murmuring ] "...is born, my angel of this earthly paradise." That's a forgery. [ Laughs ] ♪♪ [ Whistling ] [ Laughing ] Uh-oh. There's George. Darling, I have to talk some business with him. Why don't you go up and get dressed? But, darling, there's plenty of time. ♪♪ [ Whistling Continues ] I've got it. I had to wait around. Did you see O'Reilly about those sketches? O'who? O'Reilly. What is it? It's a-- Oh, hello, Lydia. Hello, George. Yes, I did. And he thought the sketches were fine. Uh, who? O'Reilly. Oh, yes. Yes. "Fine," he said. "Absolutely fine." What's that? It's only your present, darling. Oh, thank you, dear. What is it? Why don't you open it? No. I want you to tell me. Well, it's, um-- It's a diamond clip. Oh. Well, how do you know, George? [ Sighs ] Well, you see, I showed it to him at the office. Yes. It's beautiful. I just dropped it by to have the engraving job done. Uh-huh. Were you clever in the inscription, darling? Well, in a way. Oh, I wouldn't say clever, Tony. Oh, wouldn't you? No, no. Simple, I thought. "To Lydia. With love, Tony." I didn't think it was the place to be clever. Sounds like a bracelet. No, no. It's a diamond clip, darling. [ Chuckling ] Woman's intuition. As usual, 100% wrong. Why, it is a bracelet. Oh. Oh, it's lovely. Ah, and the inscription's very clever, Tony. What's it say? "Tony versus Lydia. Fights every Friday night." That's not funny, George. I don't think it's funny at all. I-- [ Woman ] Mmm. It's very nice, my dear, in a small way. [ Chuckles ] Oh, I think it's small in a nice way, Mrs. Vantine. Mr. Vantine gave me to here on our second anniversary. Really? Yes. Well, perhaps when Mr. Kenyon's as old as Mr. Vantine, I'll have more. Why, Theodore, what's the matter? It's Butch, madame. We tried the Vantine dog food again tonight, but as usual, he got violently ill. - Oh, Butch. - And now, the mere sight... of Mr. Vantine's picture on the can... fills him with canine hysteria. Oh, Theodore, you'd better take him outside for a little airing. Yes, madam. Oh. Good evening, Mr. Vantine. Ah, good evening, Mrs. Kenyon. I'm not going to wish you a happy anniversary just yet, because later I may be prevailed on to make a toast. Oh, I'm sure someone will prevail. I will, poochie. You see, pooch-- I mean, Mr. Vantine. Oh, my dear, did Mr. Kenyon tell you... that you're going to join us in Palm Beach for your vacation? No. No, I guess it must have slipped his mind. Excuse me. You'd better get downstairs. The emperor and empress are here. Mr. and Mrs. Vantine? You have uttered their names. George, go down, right? Stay with the old man. I'll be down in a jiffy. Okay. I've eaten three cans of the darn stuff... and I still haven't gotten an idea. You'd better hurry. What? You'd better hurry. Mmm. Tony? Yeah? Tony, why didn't you tell me you'd accepted the Vantines again for Palm Beach? It slipped my mind, I guess. That's what I said. To whom? Myrtle. Oh. Well, you know Myrtle. Oh, by heart. She was Miss Coney Island and Miss 42nd Street, then Miss America, and now she's Mrs. Vantine, with a British accent. Uh, you know, she's mentioned it several times lately. I think she wants us to give her our cook. I know. She's hinted to me about it too. Well, what did you do? Well, I parried her rather neatly, I thought. You parried her? Just what do you mean? Well, I made it very clear to her that this is a free country. That the slaves were liberated by Abraham Lincoln in 1865. But I did it with the utmost finesse. Lydia, you're not very bright. Well, what do you want me to do? Get down on my knees, wrap up my cook... and have her delivered to the Vantines' house with an apple in her mouth? This is no time to be losing your temper. Don't you realize that, one, Vantine Dog Food is my biggest account. Two, it means an extra million dollars in advertising, which I may get tonight. One. Three years ago, when we wanted to spend our vacation on the island, we had to go to Palm Beach because that's where Myrtle wanted to go. But we got this house as a result, didn't we? And half a million dollars more in advertising. Yes, we got the house, all right. But somewhere along the line, I lost you. Oh, you don't like the house? I love it. Then why do you want to start a fight the night of our fifth anniversary? Darling, I'm willing to drop the whole subject right now. All right. Let's drop it. Good. It's dropped. Mm-mmm. Oh, Mr. Vantine. You know my wife. Oh, yes. Yes. How do you do, Mrs. Gorell. Have you tried this ham yet? It's wonderful. That's not strange in the Kenyon ménage. You know, Mrs. Kenyon, I've been coveting and coveting your cook. Really? Yes. I often said to poochie... that the "cou-sine" at the Kenyons' is so much better... than poor little me is able to provide. [ Chuckles ] You flatter me. [ Murmuring ] Lookie, lookie, lookie. There goes Cookie. Uh, darling, may I make a suggestion? I know just what you're going to say. We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Vantine to dinner more frequently. Why keep the secret any longer? We might as well tell them right now. - Tell them what? - You remember, darling. No, I don't. Oh, yes, you do. Well, why don't you tell them then? All right. I will. We remembered how much you enjoyed Maddie's cooking, so Lydia said to me, "Darling, why not ask Mrs. Vantine if she would like to have Maddie?" [ Vantine ] Well, now, isn't that just lovely? Well, I hardly know what to say. But, um, all right. On one condition. That is, that you come over and have dinner with us one of these evenings. [ Vantine ] To your continued happiness. To us, darling. Excuse me. May I prepare that for you, Mrs. Kenyon? No, thank you, Theodore. I want to do this myself. Yes, madame. That was a dirty trick, Lydia. I'm so sorry, dear. For two cents, I'd walk out on this party. Yes, darling, but where would you go? Around the block, I suppose. [ Laughing ] Please. Let me take it to her. Please. Oh, Mrs. Vantine, I was just bringing you a plate. Thank you. You've never tasted such food in your life. She didn't seem to like it much. Hmm? Oh. Oh. Well, I guess it was childish, but I'm pretty mad. Here. Drink this up. It will do you good. What are you, a doctor? Better. Maybe just what the doctor ordered. I, uh, think you might find this seat a little more comfortable. Thanks. Incidentally, who are you? I'm the hostess. Well. I'm your guest. Oh. Well, that explains everything. Look, I'm still pretty mad, so maybe you'd better go away. Oh, I can't leave a lady in distress. I just want to think by myself. Perhaps you could think better if I took you away. Right now, I want to dig a deep hole and crawl into it. I'm wonderful with a pick and shovel. I'll let you know. Here, perhaps you better put this around you. Oh, thank you. Whose car is this? Mine. Oh. No, please. You would have to turn on the ignition to start it. But, uh, the wheels are turned in the right direction. You talk as if you needed this. I do. There's nothing so sad as a wedding anniversary. Oh, now I know you. You're "10-cent store" cynic. You say the opposite of what's printed on greeting cards, hmm? Oh. Listen. I'd like it to be wonderful for you. I'd like to see you sitting on a star. Thanks. I'm rooting for you, see? You know, I think I'm glad to meet you. [ Door Shuts ] I doubt it. Why? Any woman who's been married for five years... doesn't really want to meet me. You just want to play at meeting me. You want to shoot the chutes... and then nibble on some popcorn and run home, shivering gratefully about what you almost did. [ Chuckles ] Look here, mister, what are you selling, sanctity of the home or fun on the side? I'm for either one of them as long as it rings the bell. [ Chuckling ] What's your name? Jim Blake. How do you do, Mr. Blake. I could show you the moon, lady. Make you feel wonderful, walking out. Okay, Mr. Blake. Show me the moon. [ Engine Starts ] [ Woman ] Oh, Jim? Jim! Just a minute. Oh, see you later. Smile. She won't like it, so smile. We've been gone quite a long while. Don't you think we ought to turn back? Oh, we haven't been away long enough to impress anyone. Oh, poochie. We're the last ones. Even our hostess seems to have disappeared. Oh. The boys were commenting on your feminine instinct, pussycat. Well, I've just been using it. Have you? Yes. I saw Mr. Blake and Mrs. Kenyon drive away some time ago, and I can assure you, after consulting my feminine instinct, they are not picking daisies. [ Vantine ] The boys were discussing your woman's instinct... as applied to the new dog food campaign, pussycat. Oh, that. Well, I'm not so sure about the campaign. Aren't you, pussycat? No, poochie, dear, I'm not. Of course, I might change my mind tomorrow. Mr. Kenyon might be able to explain it... in the light of the morning after. Who knows? He might convince me. Good night. [ Kissing ] Come, poochie, darling. Good night. Oh, uh, Kenyon. Don't you worry about Mr. Blake and Mrs. Kenyon. Why, Blake very often takes pussycat out... on innocent excursions, doesn't he, P.C.? Oh, yes. Mr. Blake is very obliging. He's a handy man to have around. Good night. Good night. Well, I don't know why men trust women. Women don't trust men. You trust me. Oh, sure. But look at you. [ Growling ] [ Barking ] Are you tired? No. I feel wonderful. Ah. I said you would. Have you walked out on parties before? I make a habit of it with the right companion. What'll it be? What's the specialty of the house, pal? Hamburger with or without. Hamburger with, please. But I haven't shown you the moon yet. With. No moon. [ Man ] And yours? Hamburger without. Might as well have onions too, buddy. [ Sighs ] [ Laughs ] Mmm. Shall we have a tune? Mm-hmm. ♪♪ [ Big Band: Ballad ] I wonder if I've made a mistake. In doing what? In restraining myself from making love to you. Oh, it was nice of you to restrain yourself. I could easily have tried. [ Chuckles ] Sure. And I'd have slapped your face. Ah. That's what I thought. Well, what are you going to do about future anniversaries? Fight. Oh, you won't. You can't lick the 20th century. Not when you're married to it. You won't fight. You'll drink a little, and you'll flirt a little. It sounds nasty. You drank a little tonight, didn't you? Yes. And you flirted. Well, that's all this amounts to. You'll drink a little more next time, and you'll flirt a little more. And you won't be so particular. But in time, you'll become like me. Without the bottle, I'm nothing. And with the bottle, well, the next move is somebody like Myrtle. Oh. So, she's your moonlight. Oh, no. Not moonlight. She's fireworks, which is better than total darkness. I've meant to call it off several times, but then I always remember my firm. Collins, Wilkinson, Cohen and Blake. Blake, that's me, see? The firm gets half its business from Mr. Myrtle. And that's the story of your life. Until tonight. What are you looking for? Someone like you. I'd pin a good-bye note on Collins, Wilkinson and Cohen's pillow for you. I've got a boat on the sound. A woman can go on that boat, can't she? [ Lydia ] What kind of woman? [ Jim ] Well, she'd have to have beauty. Otherwise, I wouldn't want her. And she'd have had unhappiness. Otherwise, she wouldn't want me. It's as easy as turning on the ignition. We walked out on the party tonight. It wasn't so hard. Why can't we walk out on the world this morning? I've never asked any other woman on my boat. No? No. You know, I'm beginning to feel very sorry for you. I'm sorry for myself. That's why I've quit. I'm yellow, see? I'm not. How do you know? You haven't even tried to find out. What do you think I'm doing right now? Hoping that what I'm saying isn't true. No. I know what I want. I've always known. Come on. Take me home. Did you get that guy's line? Yeah. Gee. [ Clicks Tongue ] Them's the things I been trying to tell you. But you ain't got no boat. Thanks for everything. Good night. Remember, there'll always be a boat... burning in my window for you. Where the devil have you been? Oh, darling, forgive me. I've behaved atrociously. That's right. I was furious at Myrtle, so I went off with this man who's a perfect stranger. He means nothing to me. I'm not worried about that. Oh, I'm so sorry. I wanted our anniversary to be beautiful. But I made it ugly, I suppose. Well, it's my fault too. Oh. I love you, darling. It's still not too late. It's still our anniversary. Our anniversary's over. This is tomorrow. We can salvage something out of it. You bet we can salvage something. Do you realize you've jeopardized the entire Vantine campaign? $150,000 in commissions? But how? Don't you know Blake is a Vantine houseguest? Yes. But I didn't-- Well, what are you handing me all that applesauce for? I'm in a spot. Don't you realize that? I'm sorry. You're sorry. I didn't realize what I was doing. I'll tell you what you're going to do. You're going to get on that telephone before that female gets into bed. I want this whole mess straightened out before I lose that account. Is that all you're losing? Isn't that enough? Now get over there. I don't know what you're going to say. That's up to you. And this is the beginning and the end... of all that highfalutin "discontented wife" business too. Make it clear that the episode was innocent on your part. I will. Mrs. Vantine, please. And also that you're never going to see that man again. Is that clear? - Yes, Tony. - Good. Mrs. Vantine? This is Mrs. Kenyon. He left about five minutes ago. I'm calling to tell you I'm terribly sorry we got back so late. Well, I went out for some air, and I found him wandering around. He seemed rather lost at the party. Flirting? [ Chuckles Softly ] Oh, you flatter me, Mrs. Vantine. I'm so glad you understand. Thank you very much. Good night, Mrs. Vantine. What did she say? I don't think you have to worry about your commissions. Oh, good. Well now let's forget the whole thing, shall we? You're sorry and I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry. Maybe now we won't have to go to Palm Beach. Mm-hmm. Perhaps we can get away alone for a change. That would be nice. Let's talk about it upstairs, shall we? Hello. This is Mrs. Kenyon. Would you please send a taxi right away? Thank you. My name's Kenyon. I want to see Blake. Have you an appointment? No, I haven't. I just want to see Blake. Oh. But-- You Blake? If nothing's wrong, I am. Where's my wife? The information clerk is outside. Now don't get funny. I assure you, I haven't the least interest in entertaining you. All right, where is she? Well, who are you? - My name is Kenyon. - Oh, Kenyon. Well, how do you do? Now look. My wife is gone, and unless I'm mistaken, you've got plenty to do with it. Don't know if anything I can tell you will help-- Where'd you go with her last night? Well, don't ask me that, pal. I wasn't photographing the scenery. Look, are you gonna help me, or aren't you? What do you want to know? I want to know what she talked about. Pal, she was having a look at the horizon. What horizon? Oh, there's only one, chum. She examined it with great care. Well, she was interested, all right, but she decided to wait till she could get it at a bargain price, and she thought maybe it could be done on the installment plan. Then she went in and tried on the apron again. She didn't think it looked very pretty, so she threw it away. Well, the wind was blowing awfully hard, and there she was, in that no-man's land between the apron and the horizon. Now I had a banjo, see? It was a little out of tune, you get me? I don't know what the devil you're talking about. The lady seemed to be unhappy. She didn't like the cigarettes, the soap and the dog biscuits, chum. I wish you wouldn't keep on calling me "chum." Well okay, pal. Anything else? Did she consult you about a divorce? Divorce? No. She consult you? Yes. I got a note this morning. Well, that's a simple matter. I wouldn't get it in New York if I were you. That's messy. I didn't come to talk about it. That's all right. No fees involved. Reno's the best. Then you'll have your choice... of mental cruelty, desertion, non-support, incompatibility. Incompatibility, my eye. Now see here, Blake. There's gonna be no divorce. Is that clear? - She can't prove a thing. - Well, you're sitting pretty. According to the law, being in love with your business doesn't constitute adultery. Excuse me. Thank you. Oh. Uh-- Ask Mr. Fauntleroy to wait in Mr. Cohen's office for a minute, will you please? Uh, sit down. No. I'm going. But before I do, if there's anything else she said, be good enough to lay it on the table. And stick to the words. Leave out the music. Well, let me see. She didn't like your friends. Oh, she didn't? Well, that's too bad. And did she perhaps suggest in so many words that I quit my job? You wouldn't do that, would you? You think I'm crazy? It might help, pal. Spit in your boss's eye. Take your woman by the hand. Climb to the top of a hill. Look us over, moon. She's a woman. She's life itself. She makes the grass grow, see? I've got hold of her hand, and I'm not letting it go. She's a skylark. Just how do you fit into this picture, anyway? Oh. I'm a Mr. Nobody, see? And you're a Mr. Somebody. A woman starts out by picking her man. But if he can't play the part, the words are still there, aren't they, chum? Maybe Mr. Nobody can say 'em. And mean 'em. You seem to make a specialty of other men's wives, don't you? Look, I don't want to fight with you. No. You're the sort of guy that doesn't want to face any kind of a showdown. At the moment, I'm only interested in showing you out, pal. Don't call me "pal." Okay, chum. [ Typing ] Come in, Mrs. Kenyon. Hello. This is very pleasant. Well. [ Sighs ] Well. Couldn't you put me at my ease? Say something about the weather. It's raining. You know, maybe I shouldn't have come here. No. But I'm very glad that you did. I came to consult you about a divorce. Oh? You changed your mind since last night. I'm afraid I had to. I'm not really a divorce lawyer. You're not? Mmm. Oh. Could you recommend someone? Perhaps after I've heard your story, I might recommend myself. All right. Give it to me. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. Come on. Please. Don't make the whole thing difficult. I'm gonna make it impossible. Let go of my arm. Not until I get you home. What are you going to do, force me? You bet your life. You can call a cop if you want. You're only being silly. You're going home. You're going to live there, eat there and sleep there. Tony, you're hurting me. What do you think you're doing to me? Lydia! Here, why don't you watch where you're going? Oh, you're making yourself ridiculous. You're making me ridiculous. Hey! Come on, buddy. Move on. [ Man ] You're holding up the parade, mister. [ Conductor 1 ] Let 'em out. [ Conductor 2 ] Let 'em out of the car. [ Bell Ringing ] Hey, what do you think this is, the Olympic Games? Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, that's all right, sister. I don't mind it. In fact, I kind of like it. Tony, please let's not have a scene. Then come on home. I'm afraid you don't understand. I'm going to Reno tomorrow. Look, after five years, surely you can take a few days to think it over. I've been thinking it over for the past three years. I've seen you fall more in love with your business each year. But it was all for you. I asked nothing of you. I have no right to. You were supporting me. You weren't mistreating me. Thanks for the reference. I have only one right-- the right to leave you. Sure you have, sister. Mind your own business. You're not doing such a good job yourself. If you was any kind of a man, you'd take her over your knee and spank her. I wouldn't try it if I was you, mister. She's just a spoiled wife, if you ask me. Sure. Work my fingers to the bone and gave her everything. I didn't ask for it. But you took it. - You probably forced it on her. - Oh, go away. I can't talk to an idiot. I can. I-I mean thank you. In this new scientific, materialistic world of ours, when factories have taken over most of the functions of the females... such as making cloth, et cetera, marriage as we know it, in my opinion, is an anachronism. Say, who asked you to butt in? Oh, I just happen to be a professor of psychology. A wise guy, eh? A know-it-all. Them two-dollar words don't mean a thing. So, women ain't important anymore. What would people on Earth be without women? Scarce, madam. Mighty scarce. Solve a lot of problems if you ask me. You see, sir, she wants you to recapture the romance... of your first moments together. The grand passion can't last forever. Ecstasy, my dear lady, is a thing of the moment. Sure. You can't have ecstasy all the time. It's like eating caviar three times a day. If I liked caviar, I'd eat it three times a day. Caviar is still just fish. What are they beefing about? He wants her to eat fish three times a day, and she don't want to. I think all of you should be ashamed of yourselves, talking about divorce at a time like this. This is the time it came up. With all the agony in Spain, Poland is laid out in a corner, France is a shamble, China is rumbling like an earthquake, and you! You're worrying about something exclusively personal. I'm not interested. It hasn't got no social significance. Button your lip. Why can't I talk? This is a free country, isn't it? With free speech. Yeah. So, shut up! Go ahead, go ahead. Hit a guy with the glasses. Go ahead. Hey, Lydia, wait a minute! Where do you think you're going? I can't lose her! [ Conductor ] Get away. Let 'em out. All right, folks. All right, step lively. Step lively. Quick. Step lively. [ Bell Ringing ] Step lively. Hey! Hello, Charlotte? Is Lydia there? Oh. No, I-I'm at the Ad Club. No, I'm all right. Mmm. Only going slightly nuts. [ Sighs ] No soap. Now she's probably just gone to a hotel. I've been on the phone ever since yesterday. Since I lost her in the subway. It's not so bad, Tony. It's the old story of the neglected wife. Every man has to face it. Well, thank heaven I'm a bachelor. The worst I ever had to face was a neglected ootsy-wootsy. Just what does she expect you to do, anyway? Well, I sort of gathered that if I wanted her back, I'd have to give up my job. I wish I could help. What could you do? Now whenever I get in a jam with Charlotte, I lie. - You lie? - It's the safest, most reliable thing... a red-blooded husband can do. Uh-- But if I lied about quitting my job, Lydia would see through it in a minute. It's for you, Mr. Kenyon. Oh. Yes? Oh, Theodore. I'm afraid I'm disobeying Mrs. Kenyon's orders, sir, but I thought I'd like you to know she's home now, packing. Oh, thank you, Theodore. Uh, look. Uh, if she tries to leave, stall her, will you? Right. I'm gonna stall her. Permanently. Wish me luck, boys. Attaboy. Attaboy. You and your ootsy-wootsies. [ Lydia ] Theodore? Theodore? Uh, yes, madam? Theodore, when you see Mr. Kenyon, will you please tell him-- Why don't you tell him yourself? Theodore said you weren't expected. [ Tony ] I wasn't. I'm sorry, Tony. I didn't want to see you again. So, now you're going back to that bus we met on. Please don't joke about it. I'm not joking. I'm serious. You know, that bus belongs to me too. I was once on it same as you. And when I first saw you, I knew just one thing. I wanted to be near you. I still want to be near you, no matter how much it costs. Oh, don't be silly, Tony. You couldn't afford the price, and I'd never ask you to pay it. I know where your heart is. Well, I guess it's too late, but I quit my job this morning. You quit? Yeah. But now I feel kind of scared. Tony. Tony, look at me. Oh, I did it. I did it, all right. Well, I can't believe my ears. Well, I hardly recognized myself, and I went into the boss's office. Took a lot of nerve, let me tell you. What happened? Well, I-- I took a deep breath and busted right in and started talking. Yeah? Well, what did you say? Well, it, uh-- It happened that the president... of Red Wing Cigarettes was there in conference, so I told him off first. How? I-- I simply said... that they ought to give away gas masks to anybody who smoked his seaweed, and he got pretty sore. Oh-- [ Chuckles ] I should think he would. Yeah. And then the boss asked me if I'd been drinking, and I said no, but that it was a very good idea. [ Lydia ] Tony, you didn't. [ Tony ] Oh, yes, I did. He asked me to take it easy, and I laughed right in his face. Ha, ha, ha, ha! Oh. Didn't he get mad? Did he get mad? Why, he was furious. So I said, "Now listen. Take it easy, baldy, take it easy." Baldy? Oh. Yeah. [ Both Laughing ] [ Chuckling ] [ Tony ] Hey, let me in on it. Oh, nothing. I-- I was just laughing... at the way you told baldy off. I wish I'd been there. Just as glad you weren't. You'd have made me self-conscious. [ Phone Rings ] Hello? Hello. Is Mrs. Kenyon in? This is Jim Blake speaking. Oh, hello. It's Blake. Are you in? [ Gasps ] I forgot! She's in. Hello, Mr. Blake. I completely forgot I promised to call you. Yes. Ye-- Uh, no. Well, as a matter of fact, I've changed my mind. Give me that phone. My wife isn't getting a divorce, if that's what you want to know. Mr. Blake, it's true. He's quit his job. Ye-- Huh? Oh. Well, all right. What's he saying? [ Chuckling ] He asked me to call him Jim. Well, I don't see why I shouldn't. Hello, Jim. Yes. Ye-- No, Jim. He says he's willing to start all over if necessary, as if he'd never heard of the advertising business. Yes. Yes. Yes. What's he saying now? Oh, Jim, that may be-- Lydia, answer me. What is that man saying? Jim, you see-- Tony wants to talk to you. What were you saying, Blake? I was saying that if you quit your job, you'd freeze to death on a mountain top. That you didn't know the moon from a street lamp. That you wouldn't be Romeo. You would just be unemployed. Oh. Well, don't you worry about me being unemployed. I'm gonna be kind of busy from now on. What? You've got a lot of nerve asking me a question like that. What does he want to know? Wants to know how we're gonna live. How much money I've got. Oh, Tony, that's a very practical question. But, darling, you don't seem to understand that-- Just a moment please. What? Oh. Sure. He's gone to get some more nickels. Oh. Don't you worry, darling. We'll have enough money. Sell both the cars and the house. I guess we'll have to. Pretty expensive place to keep up. Might have to take a loss. I don't care if you don't. After all, we've been broke before. Anything you say, darling. Hello. Hello, Kenyon. Lydia. There's that man again. Don't tell him how much money we have. That's our own private business. Jim, our finances are our own private business. I'm coming right out. Don't do anything till I get there. I-I-I won't see you if you do. I'm going to bed now. Good night. The man's an idiot. Oh, let's forget him. Oh, he's forgotten. How could you ever say I didn't love you? I didn't say you didn't love me. It's only, lately, you haven't been in love with me. Mmm. Shut up. ♪♪ [ Whistling ] Mr. Gorell please. ♪♪ [ Whistling ] [ Inhales, Sighs ] Hello. George? Say, listen. Everything went off great. Yeah. Yeah. She went for the whole thing-- hook, line and sinker. No, no. No. I told her it would take two or three weeks... to get things cleaned up at the office. So all right. It'll take a couple of years. ♪♪ [ Lydia Whistling ] I got to hang up. See you later. Oh. Good morning, darling. Good morning, sweet. Sleep well? Like a rock. You know, for two cents, I wouldn't go back. Not even today. Oh, what's a couple of weeks? We have our whole lifetime ahead of us. Yup. Well, I think I'll go upstairs and finish dressing. Why, good morning, Mrs. Vantine. How do you do, Mrs. Kenyon? We were just going to have breakfast. Would you like a cup of coffee? No, thanks. Oh, isn't this a lovely morning? I didn't come here to discuss the weather. You didn't? Good morning, Theodore. Good morning, madame. Mr. Blake is very charming, isn't he? Oh, he's quite remarkable. In what way? Well, I don't know. He has a remarkable mind, I think. Are you trying to kid me? What do you mean? I mean that mental stuff. Oh, I see. Well, perhaps it would simplify everything, Mrs. Vantine, if I told you I have no intention of seeing Mr. Blake again. Are you trying to imply there's something between Mr. Blake and me? Aren't you? You're pretty smooth, Mrs. Kenyon. Smooth? When you telephoned me the other night, I was polite. I decided to wait until Jim returned and hear what he had to say. But Jim didn't return to our house, and you know it. And you know why. I'm very sorry, but this is all news to me. What do you mean you're sorry? I'm trying to be as nice as I can to you, Mrs. Vantine, but I'm wondering how long I'll be able to hold out. I don't think you realize who you're talking to. [ Chuckles ] What do you bet I do? And if you don't think I knew... that you were sarcastically hating my hide... when I was presented with your cook, you must think I'm a dumb Dora. Well, you can keep-- Look. What did you come here for anyway? To tell you exactly what I think about you. You put on a lot of airs for a woman in your position. Just because I've been patient with you, it's gone to your head. Well, this is the last time I'll be broad-minded. The perfect wife and the perfect hostess, for crying out loud. Whoo. You certainly answered my question. Who do you think you are anyway? A nobody whose husband doesn't make in a year what mine makes in a week. Will you get out of here? Not before I'm ready. I'm giving the orders, see? Hands off Jim Blake. Or maybe you think it'll be easy for your husband to find another job. Are you personally threatening to discharge my husband? One more crack and he's through right now. [ Chuckling ] Oh, aren't you funny. You really believe what you're saying. You won't have to wait long to find out. Do you think for one minute... that all the years Tony's put into his work... could be tossed aside by a scheming, greedy cow like you? He's out. Do you hear? He's fired as of today. I'm beginning to believe you could do it. And it won't do you any good to go to my husband, deary. You're not his type. So that's business, hmm? It's about time you woke up from your beauty sleep. [ Chuckling ] What's so funny? Oh, Mrs. Vantine. For your information, Tony quit yesterday. Hmm. That's a hot one. Well, it doesn't matter what you think. I don't even blame you. Well, you know, as a matter of fact, I should be grateful to you. Yes. You're Lady Bountiful. You're Santa Claus. You know, I-- I actually want to say something sweet to you. Go ahead and say it. No. No. I'd better not. It might ruin everything. Good-bye. You tramp. [ Giggling ] Tony! Tony! Yes, darling. Coming. Tony, guess who was just here? I can't think. Who? Mrs. Vantine. Oh. What'd she want? Oh, darling, I have such exciting news for you. You have? You don't have to wait six weeks or five or even one week. You're fired. Isn't it wonderful? What happened? Oh, Tony, she was impossible. I was determined to be nice to that woman if it killed me. Give it to me word for word. She played right into our hands. I couldn't resist it. I said just exactly the right things... to get you fired as of today. That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Well, yes. That's what I wanted. It doesn't really matter whether you walk out later... or she gets you kicked out today, does it? Oh, no. No. Oh, darling, we're free. Right now, this minute, we're free. Can you imagine? Mr. Blake wishes to be announced. Oh. Oh, yes. He's got a lot of nerve coming here at a time like this. Hello, Jim. Hello. Hello, Kenyon. Hello. Jim, I wish you had been here. Why? Because I'm so proud of myself. Ten minutes ago, Tony had an office, a desk, a telephone... and six weeks of slavery still ahead of him. With one easy stroke, I wiped it all out. [ Blake ] What happened? Well, with Myrtle Vantine's angelic help, Tony doesn't have to go back to the office. Myrtle's going to have you fired? Yep. But how can she if you've already quit? Well, that's the big joke. It doesn't seem funny to him. What are you doing here anyway? Oh, I just thought I'd come out. What for? To see us, of course. No. That's where you're wrong. I came to see my client. Thank you, Jim. I don't think I'm going to need your services any longer. The remains to be seen. No. Oh, don't be so stuffy, you two. You know, I have a feeling... that Jim's going to be our best friend from now on. He doesn't seem to think so. I wish you'd stop referring to me as "he." Well, anything I call you seems to be objectionable to you. What's the matter with you, Tony? What's the matter, pal? What is this, a courtroom? Well, why so angry? Well, who wouldn't be? That big fathead comes in here-- Uh-uh-uh. Tony. So, you quit, hey, chum? Yeah. So that's your story. Well, what do you mean by that? What do you mean? What's going on here? Now just one more question. Not in my house. Well, an innocent man never minds answering questions. Go ahead, Jim. Ask your question. What's your boss's telephone number? Longacre-5-0598. Shall I call, or will you save me the trouble? You don't have to call. You were lying to me. Yes. You hadn't quit your job. No. When I told you about Myrtle, you weren't happy at all. You were hating it. Yeah. And everything last night was a lie. No. When I said I loved you, I meant it. Are you sure? You shut up. Selling the house, selling the cars. I'd do anything to keep you. You didn't do anything except lie. All right. I lied. Sorry, pal. Yeah. Me, too. [ Loud Thud ] What'll it be? Hamburger please. With or without? Without. ♪♪ [ Orchestra: Overture ] They're about four rows back. [ Whispering ] Look. Look who's down there. Oh. When did Tony get back into town? I don't know. Blake and Lydia have seen you.

I think I'll run along tonight. Good night. Oh, you've done better than that. Good night, darling. Good night. Good night. Kinda late. [ Gasps ] Oh. Won't do you any good. Told the man at the desk we didn't want to be disturbed. You see, I told him I was your husband. Showed him some credentials. The most important was a $10 bill. I should learn not to underestimate you, Tony. Yes. It's fatal. You mean, it was fatal once. Well, as a matter of fact, I'm glad you're here. That's more like it. I want to be sure there are no hangovers left. And there are none. You sound kind of worried about me. The only worry I've had about you, Tony, was the fact that I was responsible for losing your job. Oh, I've had many offers. You have? Well, then I have no further worry. Except one. You see, this divorce hasn't meant a thing. I still love you the same as I always did. I'm sorry. You were so right about me. I was whirling around in a vacuum. It's called competition. Are you trying to tell me you've changed? No. I've reverted to type. The type you liked on that Fifth Avenue bus. You only think you have. Well, isn't it the same thing? No. So now you'd better get out of here. You were a sucker not to take any alimony. I only wanted my independence. I'm going back to my old job. Independence. Nobody's independent. No matter where you sit, there's always someone sitting a step higher. I can see you've changed a lot. Well, anyway, I want you to take this. It's the deed mer place on the island. Oh, no. I-- I don't want it. Do what you want with it. Give it away, sell it. It was always more yours than mine anyway. Yes. It was. Let's go up there now. Tony, are you trying to make me unhappy? If I was sure you meant that, I'd go away, but I still love you and I can't imagine anything without you. You can't without me. Tony, I look at you, and I see someone... I used to know a long time ago. Is that so? Just that. No effect whatever? None whatever. All the little things we had, the little half dreams, the pieces of the future we saw together, et cetera. I've forgotten them. Even the "et cetera." I envy you. No. No effect whatever, huh? I-- It's just a habit. It's an involuntary reflex. It proves I'm normal. That's the way I like 'em-- normal. No, To-- You mustn't forget, Lydia, it takes two to make a divorce. Just as it does anything else. Good night. [ Grunts ] Fore! Fo-- Ouch. I'm coming through! All right. Come on in. How are you, slave? Do you realize it's 3:00 in the afternoon and you're still in pajamas? Listen, George, I've stepped off that express train. I'm in the woods by a rippling brook, and I love it. Don't you envy me? No, but I've got something I really do envy you. I had lunch today with Fred Connors, president of Sheldon Motors. Oh? What's he want? He only wants you to be his new advertising and sales manager. Oh. Well, I'm not interested, George. I don't think Lydia would like it. Aren't you staking a little too much on Lydia's coming back? I'm staking my entire future. Hmm. No. I mean it. Lydia's done the greatest thing in the world for me, George. I'm happy. If you do marry Lydia again, what are you going to live on? That thing called love? This is the biggest job in the business. Nobody can afford to turn it down. Except me. Look. I took your advice once and ended up in the divorce court. You're off your nut. Anyway, I have a job. With whom? When I was in South America, I found out that they were just as much concerned... about certain problems of hemisphere defense as we are. So I talked to some of the boys in the various embassies... and together, we cooked up some ideas on it. So I stopped off in Washington and told them. This morning I got a wire offering me the job. And I accepted. George, it's exciting. I can use everything I know about advertising and public relations. Does that mean you'd have to go to South America? Yeah. From country to country. Practically disappear for a couple of years. Never mind announcing me. I'll announce myself. But, Mr. Blake, just a mo-- Hiya, chum. Where's Lydia? Uh, the information desk is right outside, pal. Now don't be funny. I assure you, I haven't the slightest intention of entertaining you. He didn't say anything funny. Now look. I received a note from Lydia this morning. She said she saw you last night and talked to you. What did you say to her? Oh, don't ask me that, pal. I didn't have a stenographer with me. Where is the island? What island? She said she went up to the island. She had to think. Oh. Oh, the island. Well, that's interesting. Where is it? I don't know. Lots of islands. Staten Island. Governor's Island. Coney Island. The Thousand Islands. Keep quiet, you. I was only trying to be helpful. Well, I, uh, think I'll go up and get dressed. Good-bye, Blake. I'm not leaving. I'm sticking right with you. See? Wither thou goest, pal, thither me. All right. George, why don't you make Mr. Blake comfortable? Fix him a little drink. Yeah. Yeah. Another drink? No. I don't think I will. Thanks. Why don't you have another? Thanks. Thanks very much. Here, let me. There we are. George, um, I've been thinking... of running up to the Island on my boat. How long do you think it would take me? Oh. You got a boat. What's her name? Oh, the name is very flexible. You see, whoever happens to be my guest at the moment, that's the name of the boat. What's the name of the boat? I just told you. Who's ever on her. Who's Ever On Her. It's a silly name. For instance, if you happened to be on her, I should call her the George. That's pretty cute. That other name is stupid though. Yes, but, George, if you did happen to be on her, and if you were sailing, what would be the easiest way to the island? Oh. You go down to-- [ Gasps ] No, you don't. No, you don't. I know what you're after. Who's-- Who's Ever On Her. That's a silly name. Mr. Gorell. Mr. Gorell. Your office called with a message from Mrs. Gorell. She said you're not to worry, sir, because she's spending... a few days with Mrs. Kenyon on the island. [ Gorell ] Ooh, thank you, Theodore. Thank you very much. Oh. I hope Charlotte will be safe on the island. [ Blowing ] Who are you trying to frighten-- me? The island's perfectly safe. Not if it's out there in the ocean, it isn't. It's not in the ocean. It's in the bay, smarty. But that's no protection. Oh. A wise guy, huh? Well, Lighthouse Island's completely protected, and always has been. Oh. Lighthouse Island. No. No. Of course wouldn't be any danger there. No. I'm sorry I frightened you about Charlotte, George. No, of course. There's no reason to be concerned about there. No. None at all. Thank you. Hello, Charlotte. You don't even seem surprised. I haven't been surprised since I married George. Anyone else around? Blake, for instance? Why don't you give her a break? Hey. Whose side are you on anyway? My own, exclusively. Jim, why did you come? I came to get an answer to a simple question. Must it be yes or no? I'm afraid so. Some answers are never yes or no. Maybe it's difficult as a lawyer to understand that. No, but this is one case I can't afford to lose. Oh, it's a simple question really. Are you going to take him back? Don't answer yet. You can't keep running away from him forever. [ Sighs ] But it's difficult... to erase five years from your memory overnight. Well, what do you propose doing? I'll handle it some way. I wish you'd let me. Oh, no. No. It's my problem. Tony will only believe me. You see, until I can make him understand... that we're really through, you and I can't be happy, Jim. [ Blake ] Why don't we go away? I've got my boat coming. She'll be here in the morning. We'd only be running away. To get married. We could be off to the mainland by noon. I know a funny little justice of the peace there, an old whaling captain. Maybe he'd rent us his cottage. We could make it our headquarters. And put notes in little bottles... to Collins, Wilkinson and Cohen... to tell them we won't be back. It's Tony. Is he hurt? I don't know. Oh, To-- We'd better get him to the house right away. How? We'll carry him. That big lug? But, Jim, he may be seriously hurt. Charlotte. Charlotte! Oh. Charlotte. Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte, call a doctor right away. Who's the winner and the new champion? Go on. Hurry. How is he, Jim? Heavy. And he uses the smelly rosewater stuff... for after shaving. Darling. Lydia darling. Hey. Cut that out. Oh, Jim, be careful. He's delirious. I love you. I love you, darling. Oh, Jim, this is no time to be funny. Well, make him stop it then. We must do something to bring him to. Maybe some water will do it. Yeah. It usually does. [ Creaking ] [ Creaking ] [ Sighs ] [ Snores ] They're both nice boys. That's not the point. The point being you want to get rid of Tony? Yes. That's gonna be pretty tough on him, Lydia. The man worships you. That's why it's so hard to do without hurting him. I don't know why, but he thinks you're perfect. Well, it shouldn't be difficult to shatter that illusion. You know, deep down, Tony's a pretty conventional person. Mm-hmm. I think I'll settle this once and for all. Oh. Couldn't you sleep? No. No, I couldn't. Me either. Kept remembering all the fun we once had here. Well, I think I'll go back. I'm cold. Look. Lydia, let's go inside. We can have a fire. I want to talk to you. Matter of fact, I want to talk to you too. [ Laughs ] My first catch. Yeah. It took you over an hour to land him. Come on. Light the fire. I think it's safer like that. Jim's kind of fussy. You know? And he's terribly jealous. Jealous? Why? Oh, Tony. Don't be so naive. Now, what did you want to talk to me about, darling? Well, I-- Well, I have a swell job in South America. I want you to go with me. Well, maybe if I have the time, I will. If you have the time? What do you mean? I want you to go as my wife. Oh, that isn't necessary, Tony. I could pose as your wife. It'll only be for a month or so. Lydia, are you out of your head? No. But, after all, I do owe you something. You know, in your time, you've spent a lot of money and attention on me. And, in all honesty, I feel you're entitled to something. [ Muffled Protests ] Lydia. What's come over you? Oh, nothing. I'm just feeling grateful. That's all. You opened my eyes last night. Come over here, honey. No. I prefer to remain where I am. If you can behave decently, would you mind telling me what's got into you? I want to make you happy. I'll go with you to South America... for two months if you want me to. Now, Lydia-- Oh. Tony, are you okay? No, no, no. I'm all right. Just leave me alone. I don't know what the devil's happening, but, right or wrong, I'm gonna do it your way. What? Maybe you're right. Two strong people like us can defy convention. Take it easy, Tony. Why should a divorce make any difference? Now, Tony, no. Please let me go! Tony, stop. I knew I couldn't trust him. Say, what is this, a mass meeting? I'll tell you what it is. She was trying to let you down easy. See? What do you mean by that? She was trying to make you go away. - Then all this-- - Yes. Can't you see you're in the way? Now, why don't you be a good sport and stop annoying her? Quit all this fooling around and get out. Particularly as Lydia and I are going away on my boat tomorrow. Is that what you want? Yes. Okay. You like it? I love it. You know, once again, I'm wondering if I was right. In doing what? In forcing the issue last night when you were upset. I practically made you say what I wanted to hear. I wouldn't have said it if I hadn't meant it. Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, Mr. Gorell. Please speak softly. Just give me something to cure or kill. It really doesn't make any difference. Hangover? Longer than the Burma Road. Hello, George. Charlotte get home all right last night? I didn't notice whether she was in or out. I don't know what happened, but I'm just now getting over yesterday. Say, what happened anyway? Oh, everything's all cleared up. Good. Charlotte's gonna join us for dinner. We're celebrating-- my going-away party. Boat sails for South America at midnight. Tonight? That's swell. Congratulations. Lydia really liked the idea? Lydia? No. Oh, she's going off on a boat too. But it's Blake's boat. You didn't-- You mean, you're going alone? Take that vulgar, vile stuff away. Give me straight whiskey. Make it a double whiskey. Leave the bottle here. George, there's no reason for you to drink. We lost, didn't we? Yeah. We lost. Going away on Blake's boat. Look, why don't you go below and make us some coffee? I can't leave the tiller. You'll find everything down there. Maybe I could do with a cup. Oh, you'll have your sea legs in no time. It's like getting used to horseback riding again. Yeah. What happened? I fell off my horse. [ Laughing ] Well, are you all right? Yeah. [ Clattering ] Oh!
