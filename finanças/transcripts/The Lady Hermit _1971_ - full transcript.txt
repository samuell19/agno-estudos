Baijiang Town Dungan Town Hello, Miss Leng. How's business? It's okay. Thank you. Hello, Miss Leng. Boss, how's business? Not bad... Miss Leng, getting groceries? Miss Leng. We've just unpacked the load of chestnuts. Take a look. Come in and have some tea. No, thanks. I'd like some chestnuts, please. That man is just pretending to be mad. I don't understand what's the attraction. We don't want to get hurt for no reason. Stop, my friend. To hell with you. You... Go away Wait. Don't play any tricks, return the silver ingots. Damn it, mind your own business, ...or I will kill you Bravo! A swordswoman! You are very skilled ...for your age. Bravo! Yeah... Nothing much, I'd say. Thank you for saving my life. Go home first. Did they hurt you? With this whip in my hand ...no one can harm me. Right... Is there a Da An security company here? Yes, over there. I'll show you. Thank you. Da An Security Service This is it, young lady. Thank you... You are welcome. Excuse me, is your boss Mr. Wang in? Miss Leng, you are back. What are we having today? Roasted pork. Hey, whom were you looking for? I can't remember. You are here for Mr. Wang? Please come with me. Your dad writes that you want to learn martial arts. Who would you like to learn from? The awe-inspiring Lady Hermit Lady Hermit? Do you know her? Actually no. She has been missing for a few years. Do you know where she is? I've been looking for her for 3 years. Finally I heard of her whereabouts. You seem pretty determined. There are only a handful of real martial arts experts. Based on my past research... I think she's the only one I'd like to learn from. Miss Cui, have some tea please. Thank you. Uncle Wang, I heard that people... have spotted Lady Hermit in Baijiang; You haven't heard? I haven't heard that before. Changchun, have you ever heard... ...of a certain Lady Hermit in Baijiang Town? There is only a Chung Kuei Temple in the town, ...but no Lady Hermit. How far is Baijiang Town from here? Not far, about 40 miles. Cui-ping, I suggest you stay here today We're escorting some goods to Baijiang tomorrow, you can go along with Chang-chun. Good idea. Chang-chun, this is my friend's daughter. Please take good care of her. Yes, I'll be at Miss Cui's service. Thank you. Miss Cui, your bed is ready. Thank you. Miss Leng, you are young and pretty. How did you end up being a maid? It's what I could do. I have no other skills. You've a point there. People do look down on others who have no skills. You don't know how snobbish people are these days. The evil Black Demon... ...shows his prowess by claiming to be... ...the number one kung fu master. Such power & prestige! So you admire him a lot? Not at all. I will kill him one day. Then I'll be the number one kungfu master... ...and people will bow to me. You want to learn kungfu skills to show off? I think it's a waste if you don't show the others what you can do. You're still young. Why don't you learn kungfu? No, I am so chicken-hearted and clumsy. Don't worry, I'll teach you sometime. Thank you. As the saying goes... ...if one plays with fire, he will get burnt. No matter how powerful that Black Demon guy is, with his bad deeds, he won't end up well. You sleep early Are you alright? I'm fine; it's a chronic ailment I just need some rest What is it? Your waist hurts again? Let me help you back to your room. Rest here, I'll decoct some medicine for you. Don't bother, I just need to lie down for a while. You should get plenty of rest and not work so much. I'm only a maid here. Thank you for being so nice to me. I never took you as a maid. Yushuang, I think... You should go to bed. You'll have to leave early in the morning. I'll guard here, you go kill her. Get her. Go. Hurry! I plan on leaving tomorrow. Why? Even Miss Cui knows about the sightings of Lady Hermit. Guess I can't stay here anymore, right? Don't worry. No one knows that you are... I wonder who runs... the Chung Kuei Temple in Baijiang Town! I think Black Demon must have set it up ...as a trap to get you. Don't fall into his trap. I've been staying here for almost 3 years; Black Demon has done more and more evil deeds I can't sit by and just watch anymore. But you aren't fully recovered from your injury yet. Hence I prefer a quiet place... ...to recuperate. And I know what you're thinking. Not only are you trying to hide from Black Demon, ...but also from someone else. Is that right? You shouldn't run, dear. Changchun is a decent young man. He respects you a lot. You know that I'm in no mood for romance. At least not until after I get rid of that villain. It's hard for one to control feelings. If you have fallen in love, ...you can't hide from him. Don't worry about it, ...just stay here. I can't let you lead a wandering life. Let's drink All set. Miss Cui... Coming... Sorry to keep you waiting. Why are you staring at me? You are gentle; Not like other escorts... ...who are so rude and rash. Who is your kungfu teacher? Master Chen, nicknamed "The Three Daggers" The Three Daggers? Never heard of him. How can you learn from a nobody? Accomplished students all have good teachers. Why don't you learn from a great teacher? Where am I going to find a great teacher? There are many kungfu masters, you just have to pay more attention. I know Lady Hermit is a real kungfu master. I must find her and request her to teach me. What if she refuses? She won't. I know all the basics. You know, Changchun...if I can find her, ...let's request her to be your teacher too, okay? She might think that I'm not good enough. Don't worry about that... ...because I like you. Baijiang Town Good to see you. Keeper, here are the goods. Thank you, thank you everyone. You are welcome. Sit down, have some tea. Which way is it to the Chung Kuei Temple? Over there, it's not that far. I'll go take a look. Meet me there when you're done. Don't go far. Come here and unload the goods. Please come in. Miss. What are you doing here? I live in Baijiang Town. What are they queuing up for? To buy charms. All of them are buying charms? It's not a good place to talk. Follow me to my place, and I'll tell you. Do you know who's the keeper of the temple? What's his name? It's Lady Hermit. I want to see your keeper. Who? The Lady Hermit. Has she invited you? No, I've heard about her a lot. If you want to see Lady Hermit ...put this back together. That's impossible. Leave right away then. My apologies, she's my relative. She's young and curious, she meant no harm. Please don't be angry... All right...Back to business. You told them I'm your relative? Forgive me. I said that just now... because I was just trying to help. You don't want to offend those people. Why did you buy charms from them then? There have been strange happenings in town. A whole family was killed... ...by ghosts in the middle of the night. They claim their charms can ward off ghosts. But they are charging ten taels for each That's uncommonly expensive. I think it's worth it; I mean, for one's life. I wouldn't buy these charms. Then you'll be killed. A few families with thoughts like yourself ...they refused to buy the charms. They were all killed within three days. Really? That's why everyone is here... ...to buy the charms. I am sure they are up to something. Mind your speech, stay away from trouble. I have to stick this charm up the door, see you. Miss Leng, I've good news. I've located Lady Hermit. Where is she? Over at the Chung Kuei Temple. But I didn't get to see her today. She refused to meet you? No, I was blocked by some people. Even if you could see her, could you be certain that she's Lady Hermit? I have my doubts. Ten taels for one charm, it doesn't seem like something she'd do. Say, even if there were ghosts, the kind-hearted Lady Hermit... won't charge the villagers so much. If she's really someone like that, do you think she is worth your respect? I don't believe she'd do such things. There's something fishy behind it. I'm going to find out the truth. Miss Cui, stay away from this. It doesn't concern you. It does, she's my master. Although I don't know her, I treat her as my master from my heart. Changchun, where are you going? Taking a walk with my horse. Xiaobai likes the grass on hillside. Can I borrow Xiaobai tonight? Um... So? No? You could borrow him... ...provided you don't whip him. Xiaobai is a good horse. Huh, what's the big deal? Lady Hermit Lady Hermit? Lady Hermit, we've been looking for you. Finally...come on Miss Cui. What are you doing here? Master Wang heard that you've come here. He was worried, so he sent me here. I found Lady Hermit, you know! Where? She was right there just now. Where is she? There. Go home and stay away from trouble. She sounds familiar. Yes, she sounds like Miss Leng. It's her. Let's go after her. Where? The Chung Kuei Temple. Chung Kuei Temple. No one's here. I saw her coming in, she must be here. Miss Leng. Miss Leng. Miss Leng. Miss Leng. Miss Leng. Where are you from? We... That's not her voice, she's not Miss Leng. You must know where Miss Leng stays. Tell me and I will let you go. We don't know. Let's go. Wait. I'll kill you if you won't speak up. Come You're looking for the Lady Hermit? I'm here. Let them go and I'll go with you to see Black Demon. Let them go. Miss Cui, Changchun, leave now! No, master. We'll kill them together. You are not their match. Go! Master. Just go! After her... Surround her. After her Where is Miss Leng? In the kitchen. Miss Leng. You... I am the new maid. Cuiping, who are you looking for? Miss Leng. Don't bother, she's quit and left. Left? When did she leave? About two hours ago. Master. Master. Master, wait for me. Master, wait. Master. Master. Master. You're looking for your master? Yes. Where? Master, please don't tease me. I beg you to teach me martial arts skills. You've got the wrong person. Master. Master. When will you stop following me? Please let me be your student. Why should I teach you? Master, look. Master. You can't even stand still. Master, please have mercy. Please take me in. Master. Okay, pick up my backpack. Yes. Let's go Let's go take a look. We can stay here, after we've fixed up the place. Yes, master. Ha, that Hermit Lady fell for my trick. If I hadn't set up the temple in Baijiang, she wouldn't have shown up. But she's killed many of our men. It's worth the sacrifice. At least now we know she's hiding in Baijiang. I will tear her into pieces. Everyone... Yes. Head to Baijiang immediately, search for Lady Hermit. You must find and bring her to me. Yes. Hang on. Don't come back... ...if you can't find her. Now go. Master, look. The cat. Master, look. Can't imagine how the cat could find us! If she could, others could too. We must be very careful from now on. Master, why did you leave the security company? Are you hiding from someone? Yes. I have been hiding from him all these years. If it was not for you, I would not show up last night. Now he knows my whereabouts. So I had to leave the security company. It sounds serious. Who is he? Our common enemy, the Black Demon. Black Demon? What's the grudge between you two? None. Just like you, I wanted to rid the martial world of a mole. 3 years ago, I went to him... ...and requested him to start afresh. Not only he refused to listen, he hit me with his ruthless "Shadow-less Claw" ...and almost killed me. Get her. Luckily, I was able to escape, ...or I'd be killed. The Shadow-less Claw is that powerful? My waist was badly injured, it took me two years to recover. That's why I lay low at the security company, trying to get back on my feet. Master, because you tried to save me, now you have to live a wandering life. I'm sorry. We're in the same boat now. Why cry over the spilt milk? Master, you can recuperate here, I'll serve you for my whole life. I'd rather be your elder sister. No, you're my master. My good master. Master, we know all the bad deeds... Black Demon has done; Do we have any chance to eliminate him? It's my mission to wipe him out. I've been thinking it over and over again; A way to counter his Shadow-less Claw. At last, I've figured out the "Flying Tiger" style. Flying Tiger style can counter "Shadow-less Claw"? I've been practising nonstop for this. And I'm confident to take on Black Demon now, but... my injury stops me. My waist... Master, you can teach me the "Flying Tiger" style, ...and I'll get rid of him. It takes a lot of time and hard work to practise. But if you're determined... with perseverance, you will succeed. I'll do anything... in order to get rid of the evil gang. Alright, I'll teach you. Let me tell you the trick. Observe. Pay attention. Got it? Look. Why wouldn't it tumble? Because the weight is at the base. That's right. That's the basis of "Flying Tiger" Style. When you get thrown up in the air, ...use your energy, place all your weight on your left foot. Like this doll, you can get your balance ...and safely land on the ground. Got it? Okay, let's pretend I'm the Black Demon; I'm flinging you up with "Shadow-less Claw". Come on, charge. Are you alright? You are not tough enough yet. You'll have to practise hard from now on. Get up, let's fix this place up first. Master Wang, Miss Cui is back. Where? Upstairs packing. Uncle Wang. Are you leaving? I'm sorry to have bothered you here. Have you found Miss Leng? No, not yet. She's strange. She left just like that. I know. Goodbye Uncle Wang. Looking for someone? I'd like to say goodbye to Changchun. He's gone out. When will he be back? Not sure...don't worry. I'll convey to him your message. Changchun... Morning, where are you going? I'm...not sure yet. Have you found Miss Leng? No. Lady Hermit is elusive. A witless young girl like you, I think you'll have trouble finding her. You called me a witless young girl? You've been looking for a day and a night, ...and nothing so far! You're a witless young girl. Don't be so sure. Tell you what, I've found Miss Leng, ...and she's agreed to teach me. Really? You're not lying? I'd be a dog if I lied. My master told me not to tell anyone, ...but you're an exception. Why did you tell me then? Don't you get it, you fool! Please give this horse to Miss Leng for me. Why are you giving your horse away? I thought you love your horse. I want to learn from her too. This is a gift from me. Alright, I'll do this. But I can't promise she'll teach you. You've still got a long way to learn. I don't think she will teach you. Then I won't find a master ever? Well, I can teach you. You? Yes, I'll learn from her during the day, and you can learn from me at night. Then you're my master? Master. Student. Any orders? Pick up my backpack. Yes, master. Come on. Yes. Where will you teach me tomorrow night? Wait for me in front of the graveyard. Thank you. Are you still keeping the torn purse? It's fine. Give it to me. It's torn. My master is waiting, I have to head back. -See you tomorrow. -See you. Cui Ping. I've forgotten a verse, please ask your master for me. A verse? You know poetry? A little. Let me hear it. She lies watching the stairs in the cool moonlight She lies watching the stairs in the cool moonlight? Ask your master, what's the next rhyming verse? Would she know? I'm sure she does. Fine, I'll tell you tomorrow night. Master, this is from Changchun. Xiaobai is a good horse. I like him too. Take good care of him then. I will. I almost forgot. Changchun asked you for a verse. What verse? She lies watching the stairs in the cool moonlight He said you might know the next verse. How would I know? He seemed quite confident. Oh, don't listen to him. She lies watching the stairs in the cool moonlight and two stars parted by the River of Heaven. Come here. You can't even stand still; got to work at it. Get up, we'll practise tomorrow. Practise more tomorrow. Changchun, I'm impressed. You've learnt well in less than a month. Because I have a good teacher. How will you thank me? I'll serve you for my whole life. Is that good enough? Really? Can we learn some more? I'm not feeling well, we'll stop here. Are you alright, Cui Ping? I...feel dizzy. Dizzy? Cui Ping. Cui Ping. Your forehead is hot. Miss Leng can cure you, I'll get her. Don't bother, I'm feeling much better now. That was quick. Master... My injury! Help me. Rest a while. I've to go to Changbai Mountain in a few days. Changbai Mountain? To pick some medicine for my injury. How long will that take? A whole month. Let me go, master. It's very cold, and dangerous. I am worried that you can't take the hardship. I will go anywhere if that will help you. I'll go tomorrow. Changbai Mountain? Leaving today? I don't want you to wait for me here tonight, that's why I've come to tell you. When will you be back? Not sure. But I'll be back to see you. This is for you. What are you doing? Who are you looking for? Your boss. I'm in charge here, what can I do for you? Tell Lady Hermit to show her face. Lady Hermit! We don't have anyone by that name here. Stop pretending. Who is he? He works for me. I saw him with Lady Hermit before. Hand her out and your lives will be spared, or else... Truly there's no Lady Hermit here. So you refuse to hand her over? How can I hand her over? Well, you asked for this. Go. Burn it down. Yushuang... Yushuang Yushuang Changchun... Master Wang's whole family, all thirteen of them, ...were slaughtered. They burnt down the whole place; Nothing but ashes left. Master Wang, I'll take revenge for you. I promise. That is my promise! Let's go... Lady Hermit! What a surprise! Come on! Surround her. Yes. I want your head. Your shoulder. Your leg. Let's run Grave of Wang Chengen How are you feeling? Much better now. Yushuang. I want to tell you something; Something which I've kept silent for two years. I knew that you're an outstanding person. Over the past years, I've always had a soft corner... Human beings can't be devoid of feelings. I do understand your affection. The other day when your sent over your dear Xiaobai ...I was really touched. I wanted to see you right away. But I've sworn that, I'll put everything aside until I get rid of the evil. I don't even know if I'll live after that. I can't tell the future, that's why I don't wish to get attached. And when that day comes, when you've got rid of the evil; What will you do? When that time comes... only then would I consider my future. Yushuang, I respect your decision. You live, I'll live. You die, I'll die. What? The waist hurts? You rest up good. Tomorrow I'll go hunting, then you'll have some meat. Changchun, let's take shelter in the main house. Alright. Master... The house is almost fixed. I don't think we'd need so much wood. Sit down and have a rest. Have some water. There's a cut, let me take a look. Cui Ping is back home. Let's go inside. Yes. Cui Ping. Cui Ping. There she is! Did you have a hard journey? What's wrong with you? Are you angry with someone? None of your business. Alright. I'll cook something good for you later. Or you'll fall, got it? Got it. Try again. I can't. Take it slowly, you've just healed. Rest a while. You lazy girl You've just waken up? Come practise. Practise the "Flying Tiger" style. Get up, again. Again. Stop it, his wounds just got better. Does it hurt to see him fall? What did you say? Please. Don't play dumb. What do you mean? I think you know exactly what I mean. You... Yushuang, don't be mad, I'll ask her. Cui Ping, what are you up to? Move over. Are you mad? Yes I am, what is it to you? You aren't leaving. Why not? How could you do this to your master? If not for our past relation I'd have killed you. Cui Ping, your master saved you, she has taught you well. How could you be so heartless? For the favour she's done for me, I'll return her with Black Demon's head. You... Wait, you're going to look for Black Demon? Yes. This isn't a joke, you aren't ready yet. Don't go get yourself killed. You will be glad... if I get killed. Nonsense. Fine, I want to know how good you are. Come on, draw. If you want to go, you must win first. Kill me! Kill me. Cui Ping. Cui Ping. Yushuang, she's gone to find Black Demon. What should we do? We'll go there. Miss, please come inside. I'll look out here, you go steal her horse. Go. Come on, we have a customer. Have some tea. Go... What is it? Lady Hermit is inside. Go... Lady Hermit is here? -Denglong. -Yes. -Wangxiang. -Here. Kill Lady Hermit on the way. Alive or dead, you will be rewarded. Yes. Miss. Which way to the base of no.1 in martial world? That way, about five miles. Thank you. Why are you going there? To kill Black Demon. This isn't easy. There are three obstacles to pass, before you can see Black Demon. Many failed to... even make it through the first one. They all died. Don't go, miss. Attack We've been expecting you...Kill them. Spare me... Sure. Number One in Martial Arts World Hurry! Cut it down. Lady Hermit This is a dead end. Charge. Changchun, I'll wait for you outside the forest. Who are you? Catch her. Go! Number One in Martial Arts World... So boastful! I'll cut down the flag first. Go! Where are you going? Surround her. Li'l brat, who's Lady Hermit to you? My master. Why isn't she here? You'd be dead if she's here. Yes. You're very determined. Since you're here, I'll put your determination to rest. Come on, I'll fight you alone. Move over. Yes. Come down here. You're a guest...After you! How dare you! You brat. Kill her. Yes. Black Demon. Lady Hermit. Master. Move away. Impressive. You've improved a lot. Lady Hermit. What else have you got? Show me. Anyone else? Master. Move away. Lady Hermit, how's your waist holdin' up? Master...wake up. Come on! Master...wake up. Don't be sad. Yushuang, how are you feeling? Don't worry, I'm fine. Look at him. So unrighteous & looked down on everyone; Well, this is his end! Do you understand, Cui Ping? Let's go, Yushuang. Listen...hear that noise? Over there, go take a look. Good riddance of the evil; My sword is a wedding gift. Master, I must find you; No matter how far you are, I'll find you!
