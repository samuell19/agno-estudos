Ah! Sleep. Hey. All units respond. This is all he had on him. And has it been returned to the family? Well, not yet. Anything else? Yeah, the slugs were made from a frozen polymer. It melts just after impact, so you can forget ballistics. The scene of the crime was wet and steamy, so no fingerprints. Then, obviously, a rookie. Yeah, no shit. Katy buy you a new suit? Discount days at Macy's. Yeah, that's nice. The blue was an option. Fuck you. According to the manual, the killer should be present at the victim's funeral. According to the manual... you've been watching too much Netflix. I love "True Detective." Ah, forget it. Nothing happens here. We're too close to Canada. They have that in New York? What's that, funerals? Netflix. Oh, believe me, man. New York homicide, you don't need Netflix. So tell me, how come a guy who's worth $200 million comes to live in a lost fucking town like this? He was born here. In this town, everything belongs to him. Well, we followed the manual... came to see if the killer turned up to the funeral. He didn't know the manual. Oh, he didn't know the manual. Got it. That's why he didn't come here. OK. Come on. Mr. Brigleur. Brigleur. I know this may sound like a stupid question, but did Mr. Kessler have a lot of enemies? An industrialist of his stature only has enemies. It's a mark of importance. You hear that, Davies? He must be very important. No shit, right? Huh? You haven't asked me any more question. So you're the executor of Mr. Kessler's last will and testament as well as his properties. I already know that. What do you know, that you're the number-one suspect? What? Are you not going to answer? Nothing to say? That was not a question but a supposition with an affirmative tone. OK, well, consider it a question. Mr. Kessler has a descendant by the name of Charlie Kessler. If the heir should die, the Kessler Group would be broken up, its division sold off separately, exactly which most of their opponents had been hoping for. So you lose your job, right? Therefore, I have no interest in the disappearance of Iver. Do I remain at the top of your list of suspects? Just the one wife? Just one, confined to a mental home over 10 years ago. She has lost all memory and is, therefore, incapable ever suffering any sense of loss, so... OK. So if I wanted to meet this Charlie Kessler? His address is secret. Inside, you will find the proof that Charlie was in Paris at the time of the murder. Shit. Second time today. Hey, I'm sorry. It happens a lot. May I leave now? Yeah, sure. Oh, I'll show you out. No need. Got a good memory, and I know your office only has a single corridor. Fighting broke out overnight between rival factions along the Israeli-Syrian border. The initial reports claim Israeli... I need to go here. ...jet fighters bombed a guerrilla base, killing at least 40 soldiers... That's far. ...and 13 civilians. Damage to the base is said to be heavy, and the Israeli jets are reported to have made it back to... Can we talk? This is not a secure line. You the snowmobile rental man? Where you going? To the Pacific. I'm not a travel agency. So? Trust me. A plane is less risky. Planes scare me. Hey, uh, there's no daily special? A daily special? - No. - OK. All right, I'll do the cheese and no pickles. Never been any. Oh, good. A Bud? Oh, you got something else? Some tea, maybe? Coffee. Same as this? Yes. Oh, a Bud then. Thanks. This place is the back end of nowhere. Yeah, no shit. They got Bud. What the hell are we doing here? Well, they found an old sea plane about five years ago, crashed. Maybe the pilot is on the side. I don't fucking know. a little bit. Yeah, no worse than this coffee. That was quick. Microwave. Oh, great. They have a saying here that says, once you learn how to walk, they're going to have to shoot you. That's nice. I was already fascinated that a guy from New York asked to be transferred here. Been a long time since anyone fascinated me, buddy. Oh, Kiki told me, if I leave you alone too long, you're going to get lost. Yeah, well, maybe I want to get lost. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK. There's no problem. There's nothing for 60 miles. I know. I manage an inn an hour away from here if you want. You're welcome. There are five more that needs to be removed. Ah! No, no. The more you tense your muscles, the more it will hurt. No, no, no. Ah, ah, ah! Fuck. Since I fear you'll leave me behind on the Learning ,, learning your smile when you come my way. You know, it's pretty cool you can smoke here. Oh, here you have a choice. You do your dying to colds or cancer. Hm. This place is like a time machine, man. You sure this is legal? You see any other officers? Good point. Thanks, Mary. Ice cream, really? I can't get enough. Well, I suppose it reduces the risk of thermal shock when the. You don't mind, right? I'm going to go pay. Looking for once a better time to love. Forget her. It'll be good for you to move on to something else. I think that's what God said to Jesus, right? What are you waiting for, her coming back? I'm not waiting for anything, not anymore. Hey, guys, listen. The music's pretty good tonight, so I'm going to stick around. And it was lovely to see you. Well, take care. Thanks for dinner. No problem. Did you tell him? Not tonight, honey. The more you wait, the harder it's gonna get. Oh, I know. I know, I can't leave it outside. Before sunrise, the wolves would strip it to the bone. Food is rare this time of year. You'll need plenty of protein. If you don't relax, your bones won't heal. And in six weeks, there'll be no more ice on the roads. You'll need a boat. Have a good night. Hey, you received this. Yeah, what is it? It's from Kessler. It's the ballistic report you requested at the time. And what did it say? It's about the ice bullet. They say not many people can use that, such a weapon. It includes a list too. Thank you. Um, my name is Melody. And I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't found me. What are you doing here? I had an accident on my snowmobile. I followed the slope when I saw smoke. What were you doing on the snowmobile around here? I'm crossing the Rockies. I've been planning to do it for a year. All by yourself? I live all year in buildings, and this is a real luxury. I purposely came here not to be bothered by people. I... well, I'm sorry. And I'll leave as soon as I can. How? I don't know, uh... by road? There are no roads here, only the frozen ice that forms in winter. Give me a good reason to help you, or you leave tomorrow by foot, and they fish you out with the salmon when the snow melts. Melody. Your clothes are clean and dry. You should put them on. some time to look at the list. Two names don't make a list, Captain. The first person has been locked up for five years. OK. I looked him up. The second is a sniper for elite special forces. That's pretty hot shit. Tropical, even, especially after he was in Iraq during the time of the murder. Yeah, well, Iraq's the Middle East, Captain. It's not the tropics. Who gives a damn? He's not our man. Hey, we still need to find the address of the guy who made him, OK? Those two names are just the tip of the iceberg. It's been 10 months. You're wasting your time. You got something else to do? Yeah, right. Who cares? - What did Kessler do to you? - Nothing. I just like to finish what I started. You know what I mean. Hey, Bob, can you check these names? They made calls during the funeral. Check them against Brigleur's contact list. See if any of them match, OK? Check them all? Yeah, check them all. Hey, why the face? I received my transfer. Well, congratulations. You received notice for my transfer... Uh, yeah. ...three weeks ago, and you didn't bother opening it. Sorry. It's an old habit of mine. Oh, I already knew a month, but I couldn't just face telling you. I put in a request for my replacement. You're going to get promoted. You'll need to fill out some papers. Shit. And I'm going to have to call you Sheriff now. Go fuck yourself. I'm not the sheriff. Listen, I just don't know how to say goodbye. It's easy. Goodbye. Goodbye. How long was I sleeping? Enough. You must start training tomorrow. What training? You'll have to walk far and quickly. Well, what about my snowmobile? I don't know. I'll bring it back if I can. I haven't done anything to you. I found you, fed you, cared for you. It is up to you to do what is necessary to leave this house as soon as possible. Am I making myself clear? Crystal clear. There is water are on the table. If you want a drink, you will have to stand up. Ah! Fuck. What caused the accident? If an animal had crossed your path, there would have been traces. Why? I don't know. Maybe I just fell asleep. In this cold? I... I lost control. I need to understand. There's nothing to understand. Is it so important? Yes. I had a stand-off with a wolf earlier, and he has tasted human blood... yours. Is that serious? A wolf never forget the taste of blood. It won't give up searching for it. Sooner or later, I'll have to kill him. Hey, Sheriff. I found two matching numbers on the list. Thanks. Good night, Sheriff. Sheriff... sheriff, my ass. Brigleur didn't want to talk to you, Malcolm? Here is your bag. What are you doing? You still have a piece of wood under the skin. If I don't remove it, you won't stand no chance. Drink. It's going to be painful. It already is. Bite. Hi, there. Um, I'm looking for her. Are you the police? Does it make a difference? Did she leave an address, a destination? Yeah, Pacific Ocean. And just in case something went wrong, is there a way to find her or what? There is a satellite beep under the seat in case of emergency, but it must be activated. Otherwise, it drains the battery. I need a snowmobile and cans of gasoline. Sure. What name do I put on the bill? There are no bills, much less a name. But if that beeper emits anything, send a message to this number immediately. Am I dying? You could have. But you're fine now. You should eat now. Thank you. I'm not used to saving people. I've the stuff that was inside. There are no cell phone in your bag. You don't want anyone to find you, do you? No. It's just a week away from my phone. That's the deal. My name is Henry. Here you are. Yeah, I took your advice. You've changed your clothes. What, do you have eyes in the back of your head? I sense washing powder. You can smell that from there? I enjoy the same smells every minute of the day here. Anything new gets noted very quickly. I don't know how you stand it out here. You mean like in the cities? Yeah, but there's nothing here. Well, if nothing means no noise, no pollution, no cars, no Starbucks, then, yes, there is nothing here, at least nothing useless. But if you look closely, you'll find everything you need. In a couple of days' time, we will be walking for long hours. We? Or I'll just drop you off where there is no danger. What danger? Where you can survive. Is that why you were so mad when I first got here? Partly. "The Art of War?" Did your wife take the rest of the books when she left you? I had no other books... nor wife, for the matter. Sorry. I can be nosy at times. At times? Such a man's book. The ultimate aim of war is not to win costly victories but to prepare long-lasting peace. Sun Tzu was a philosopher. Um, war is not an art. You want to know something funny? Nope. Right. You don't laugh. Rarely when cutting logs. What's so funny? I was just asking myself, is it necessary for a mountaineer to be so serious when he chops wood? I'm not a mountaineer, but I have adapted. Here. Don't move. What is this? Hold still. The plant containing the most silica, perfect for fractures. It strengthen both the bones and the cartilage. Well, why didn't you use it sooner? Because putting a splint or a cast on a hematoma, it is useless. It would be like if I was trying to chalk you. Oh, yeah? You were never tempted? Now you can use your arm. Ribs are just a matter of time. Well, for someone who's not used to saving people, you seem to know what you're doing. I've been through a lot. I do my best not to be dependent upon anybody. And you say that for my benefit. You still haven't told me what you were doing here. shot, high and just missed it in. Pulls back out on the the puck. Penalty is over... I guess you want a coffee? Yeah. You have any vacancies? Well, we won't put you out in this time of night. It's going to hit tonight. Hit? Well, here, the cold, it hurts. And in the end zone the play. field has been in the end zone, and that's a touchdown. Down. It's intercepted. It's picked off. Yeah, and this one is underway. And the kick into the end zone, being run out for 4 yards. And Cooper still on his feet gets extra yards down the sideline. Ferrell trying to out-race the Jaguars... Captain, how's life? Oh, you know, not too much going on for me these days, just trying to keep busy. I'm about to give Kessler's watch back to his wife. Look, I'm heading in right now. I'll call you later, OK? All right, bye. Hi. Hi. Nice place. - Follow me. - Nice. Not more than 15 minutes. OK. No contact. Yeah. She could panic. Speak slowly, and do not contradict her. Understood? Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Hi. You don't know me. But, um... It's a long time since I've known anyone. - Please. - Thank you. Look, I, uh... I don't want to stir up any painful memories for you. In my state, a memory could be miraculous and never painful. And you don't find it unsettling, the forgetting? Young man, that question is as naive as a description. How can we know what we've already forgotten? My only fear is losing what I still know. I cling to it each and every day, like a lifeline. But what has gone is gone and can no longer cause suffering. Don't take this badly. But tomorrow, I won't remember you. Ah. I only remember things from long ago. Perhaps it's not even the first time we've met. No, no. It is. I would have told you otherwise. Ah, but you see, I would have already forgotten. Please, the chair. Do you remember your husband? Not really, just a vague idea of his existence. But I couldn't put a face to any feeling. I understand. Is he doing OK? Well, actually, that's hard to say right now. Whether he's alive or dead, it makes no difference to me. Unfortunately, he's just a stranger. Was I happy when I was with him? Honestly, I don't know. I just came to give you his watch back. If you leave it here, I'll forget it when you go. If you give it to me, I'll be asking myself where it came from by this evening. If you keep it, at least one person will think of it. I thank you for your time. I won't bother you much longer. And I'll make sure your son, Charlie, gets the watch. I may have lost my memory, but I still know I bore a child. And whatever else it might have been, it most certainly was not a boy. Control. Again. Breathe. No breath. Balance. Silence. Control. Now I know why you're here. Jerry, this is Bob. Now you will receive all the communications on your phone. Thanks, Bob. I'm going to do it tomorrow. Yeah, you've been saying that for days now. Captain. Are you sitting down? Yeah, come on. What is it? She arrived in the US a month ago. You're sure? The same passport number, the same airline as the funeral. However, not a trace of credit card use... no Visa or Amex, zilch. She must be paying everything in cash. We can't get any lead on her. Well, when's the return schedule for? There's no return planned. That means she's found him. How could anyone track down a killer like him? When what's needed to be done to find him is done. I don't get it. Look, he's deliberately leaving a trail. They? Is he that stupid? No. I don't think so. Look, when you want someone to retrace your steps, you sign-post it, right? And that's exactly what he's done. They? What? Why? Because he's expecting other, OK? But only just like us, he's expecting to find a son. Excuse me, Kappa. - But I'm still a bit lost here. - No. Listen to me. He's waiting for his prey to make the first move. I thought you would hesitate at least for a second. The weight will be so intensely crushing that, eventually, you'll find the strength to move. We don't really know our own bodies till we push them to the limits. Right now, you're just making acquaintance with yours. So you're a torture expert. That's an insult after the way I've nursed you. Who are you? If your legs are squashed for too long, your veins will become irreparable. If you stay like that for another minute, you limp for the rest of your life. After 10, you won't walk again. I'll say it again. Who are you? I know who you are. I know what you do for a living. And I came here to kill you. Oh. When I take off the log, the pain will be more acute than it is now. After, you'll feel better. Ah, ah, ah! Ah! Fuck! There you go. Are you leaving? Yep. The storm is too strong. - Even wolves don't come out. - Great. That's funny. I saw her about a week ago, maybe more. She's fearless. Yeah? Nah. An hour away from here. She was going east. But if I were you, I'd wait a bit. It'll blow hard. And unfortunately, we don't have French toast. I don't remember his face. He knew yours by heart. You were not paid to know that. The absence of parents can cause emotional immaturity. I will classify this as a provocation in this category. I spent every Christmas with you, but not with him. It's your father who bought your gifts. That's not true, Brigleur. When I was 14, I followed you into a store when you bought me the flute. And you broke it the minute you unpacked it. Yeah. I thought I'd get a slap or something, but you didn't even move. That's why I knew you'd never be anything but an employee. He missed my birth. I missed his death. I did everything to be like him. I dressed like him. I studied what he studied. I wrote him a letter every week so that he would know everything about me, like a real father. Every Saturday, I'd run and hide at the boarding school so that I could see him arrive to pick me up. And then when he dropped me off, I'd run and hide so I could see him leave. If you only knew the things I do behind your back, Brigleur. Malcolm is much less naive than I am. You're going to have to become accustomed to his presence. It's stipulated in the insurance contract. I liked it better when we were kids. Me too. The Ski-Doo's not working anymore. If you want to go away, the path is clear. You don't have the balls to kill me. And you're going to let nature do it? You killed my father, and now you're toying with me. Tell me why I'm still alive. The art of war is... Oh, for fuck's sake. I'm going to die here, and you're fucking quoting your stupid fucking book. Fuck off with that shit. I need to understand. When did you figure it all out? The weight of your empty bag. Fuck. The overly sharp swerve of your handlebar. Falling asleep driving makes you veer off gradually. No cell phone, no ID. Doubting is my nature. Did you look at him before you killed him? Did you look at his face? Did he say anything, like a name? Avenging your father doesn't make you his daughter. He didn't even want a girl. That's why he called me Charlie. So you're going to kill me. You're the second part of the contract. You don't think that it was fully your decision to come here, do you? Who wants me dead? Give me a name. There is no name, just a phone number. Give it to me. I'll take outside. You've got to be kidding me. Come on. Fuck. Shit. Fuck! Shit. Hey, Davies, listen. It's me. The power's out, and I need an internet connection. At 2 o'clock? Yeah, at 2:00 in the morning. Come on. I'll go to my computer. OK, listen. I think I found it. Obviously, there's no credit card transaction history because she doesn't have one. - What? - Yeah. Brigleur organizes it, takes care of all of it. It's Brigleur who pays. So if we find Brigleur's account details, then we'll find signs of the daughter. Right now? Please, do it for me, OK? All right. Oh, you're kidding me. Wait a second. Lieutenant, to what do I owe this nocturnal pleasure? Where is she? You understand that I cannot answer you. I don't give a shit. Tell me where she is. - I - don't have the right. Well, who's going to stop you, your boss? He's dead. I am paid to respect my contracts. I don't have the right to say. Listen to me. She's going to be dead in a couple of hours if she's not dead already. You understand? No matter what her training is, it doesn't make a difference. This guy is more than a professional. Do you have any other questions? No. Then good night, Mr. Kappa. Hey. I've got it. He paid for the ticket to Washington state a month ago. Yep. When I talked to him, he said he stayed in Europe. What about the second number on Bob's list? Well, he didn't pick up. Do you think it's Charlie's number? No. He, she, whatever, I mean, they would've picked up. 40 miles north of Oroville. Oroville, where the hell is Oroville? Oroville, Oroville, motherfucker. Bob, you're a genius. You asked for the weather report... like I said. Captain, listen. Call me when you get to Oroville, OK? I've got the exact location. Meet me there. Kappa, we've got no warrant. No, listen. We're not going to go and arrest anyone. We're going to go and save her before he does anything, OK? Sometimes I forget that you killed him, and I hate myself for that. I need to remember why I came here. Charlie! Charlie! Aw, no, no. What's the price for a girl like me? Malcolm's? What do you think? Oh! Ah, ah, ah! Ah! Did you find what you were looking for? You need to know that if I hesitated even slightly, this would have been impossible. Close your eyes. They never forget the taste of blood, like me. Uh! Oh! You good? Yeah, I'm good. That's enough.
