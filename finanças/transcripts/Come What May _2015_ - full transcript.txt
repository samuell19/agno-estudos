ONE YEAR EARLIER, IN GERMANY Delicious, aren't they? The best in ages. On Sunday, I'll go pick more with Gran. What is it, Daddy? Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! - Back inside, please. Close the door. Everything's fine. Close the door. Close the door. In the bathroom. - Take a look. - See this? Come on, help me. Here. No, we have that. Look. Here! We also found communist propaganda in the bedroom. Go! Max, come! Quickly! Go, go! Over here! Shoot! Shoot! All the bodies over here! Yes, Sergeant! Bring all the bodies here! Let's go! All the bodies back there! Shh... FRANCE, SUMMER 1939 Go on, go on. Go on, go on. Hey, don't stack them all the same way. They'll tip on the first bend. Stagger them top to tail. Don't do that in Belgium? Sure, only we don't use... the same stagger. What do you mean, the same stagger? Yes, it's better like that. Time to eat, I'm hungry. Let's go around. Watch. Come on, Hitler! Come on! Stick with me. Come on, Josephine. It's time for lunch. Come on. Never go behind the horses. They get feisty with this heat. Nasty temperament, that one. That's why we called him Hitler. The other one is called Charlie. No, thanks, I prefer water. - Really? - Yes. Beer! It makes some tired. For me, it's the opposite. Max. Here, you have to drink. You see? It's like the graveyard Gran took me to on Sundays. Max, you must speak French now, like I taught you, even with me. It's very, very dangerous to speak German here. Understand? Military graveyards are all the same. Gran says in graveyards you can get some peace. Think we'll ever see Gran again? The wind-pump was hit bad by last winter's gales. I patched it up, but... How much longer will it last'? In my opinion, not through next winter. Right. It can't wait any longer. We must equip the water tower with an electric pump. Miss Blondel, is there still time to apply to Arras Prefecture for a grant? Well, in late August they're a bit slow. We can apply in a fortnight's time, but it won't be dealt with before early 1940. All going well, we should get a grant to cover 70% to 80% of the total outlay. That's all very well, but it doesn't tell us the end cost. And you've read the papers. If war breaks out, like they say, I don't think our wind-pump will be a priority for Arras. They've been talking war for years! Roger, come on! I say we just vote on the issue of the day. Miss Blondel, note on one side those for modernity, and on the other, those for standing still. So, who's for modernity? Pastis? There you go. White wine for Albert. Good, you served the beers. To the wind-pump! To the wind-pump! Cheers! - Will you dance? - Mado... Just to please you. - Not dizzy? - A little. Let me show you. Just let me play! Max! Max. Come on, time for bed. Come on. Come on. [ Max crying 1. Daddy! [ Max crying 1. Daddy! 3 SEPTEMBER 1939, FRANCE DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY Daddy! Max. Go away! Go away! I want my daddy! Daddy! 9 MONTHS LATER, MAY 1940 They're here. I'm ready. Tag! Move up. Come closer. I had the Prefecture earlier on the phone. The Germans have been at the gates of Arras since early morning. Now, we mustn't give in to panic. The town is defended by the British like in '14. And back then, Arras never fell. The Germans, it'll take the time it takes, but we'll send them packing just like last time! One year ago, the Government gave us instructions in case of invasion. Each municipality north of Paris has been told to evacuate its inhabitants to host towns further south. The Prefecture has now asked us to act, and it is our duty to do so! We must go to Dieppe in Seine-Inférieure. We will temporarily abandon our fields and homes, and go to Dieppe, calmly, as we've been asked to do. They promised a police escort, where is it? You know what? I have faith in this. I don't need anybody holding me by the hand. We can't just up stakes and leave everything not knowing what's ahead. What do you suggest? We wait here for the Germans and suffer the trenches, the bombing, and the gas, just like in '14? The Boche are at the gates of Arras! Before long, they'll be here! Do as you like. I have no orders to force people to leave. I'm putting no onus on anyone. Go your own way. Come, Made. Go on! Scram! Go on, scram! Go! Ah! Go on. I'll go pack the car. We'll hitch it to the wagon to save petrol. You won't forget to lock up? What for? At least passers-by won't break the door down. No, I can't leave that. And how's the Saint-Emilion doing? Ripe for drinking, too. Can't leave it for the Boche! What about the boy? Arras was evacuated, except for the prison. So the father's either been killed in the bombing, or recaptured by the Germans, which is just as bad. Take him with you as far as Dieppe. Bound to be lots of other orphans there. Must be some arrangement for them. Evacuate! Come on! The alarm! Go! - Evacuate! - Come on! Blimey! I thought all the civvies had left the town! No! No! No! I'm Belgian! I'm Belgian! Shh. The Germans are in the tunnels, sir! Where? They came down a side tunnel from the town hall. Everyone in 4C with me. With me! Wait! Wait! Go, go: Go' Go, go: Go' Quiet! Move, move! Quiet! Shh! Quickly! Over here! With me! Fire at will! I want to stay here. My daddy will come to fetch me, he promised. When we rebuild, we'll face the kitchen south for light. Come on! Whoa... You're right. First Dieppe, then we'll see. Very well. But if you follow me, we stick together and you do as I say. Otherwise, it won't work! As usual. Giddy up, Hitler! Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. Quickly! Hey, hey! This way! Shh! They're falling back. Bring the crates down. Bring the crates down! They were just talking about exploding all the tunnels. What? How do you know? Over here! So, you understand German? Hm? Who are you? What are you doing here? I escaped Germany several months ago. I'm an opposition activist. I thought I found refuge in France, but I wound up in prison in Arras, so, now you know. So, you know your way around here? Yeah, a little. - Are we north or south of Arras? - South. Oh, hell. Why, what difference does it make? The difference is the entire British army moving north from Arras to Dunkirk. And I'm stuck with a German army in my bloody way. - Dunkirk? - Yes. So, you're pulling back to England? Already'? Good luck. Where are you going? A little village 25 kilometers south from here. I think we should stick to the woods. Airplanes. We? I haven't slept in three days. I'm tired, and I can't think of anything else to do. - What? - This way. Get your hands off! Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Let's go! What did you do to be put in prison? The French put me in prison when they found out I'd lied about my nationality. They thought I was a spy. Are you surprised? I mean, come to think of it, you could tell us anything you want. - Look, you're an Englishman. - Scotsman. Well, a Scotsman. I'm not forcing you to listen to me, or believe me, and even less, to follow me. Are we agreed? Goon! Go, quickly! Come on, children! Goon! Good boy, Hitler, good boy. Would you mind being our scout? Meaning? Cycle ahead to see if we can join the main road unhindered. Council meeting. Council meeting. Council meeting! There are no escorts on the roads. Can you believe it? So, we'd best avoid the jams. I say we take the byways we all know. Who's against? No... Good. They'll have it sorted when we get to Dieppe. Let's go! Goon! Go on! I wouldn't mind spending the night here. A Dim? Huh? Paul? Shh! We had to leave immediately, follow the Mayor. But to go where? I was more concerned with which bottles to bring than to ask where we were going. Then I woke up and emerged from my cellar, they'd all left. You fell asleep in your cellar? Mm. Wait till tomorrow. By night you're sure to get lost. It's night for them, too. They've stopped somewhere to sleep. - How is Max? - Good, I think. He's doing well in school. So I heard. - In school? - Yes. With Miss Blondel. Ask him if he's seen any German or French troops in the area. He hasn't, I already asked. Hm? Well, then, I don't understand. Where are the French? Isn't there any joint command between your two armies? I can't believe this. What? Us fight under French command. That's asking... Well, if you stood up against Hitler from the start, we wouldn't be in this mess. While you diplomatists were taking tea with the Nazis, people in Germany were getting killed and risking their lives to stop what's going to happen. I dragged my son into this for nothing, and now it's too late, it's too late. You British and French, you have no courage. Who the hell are you to talk to me about courage? How about this? This is a Chateau Pétrus, 1908. Mm. This is a miracle in a one-horse village like this. He's wondering where you got it. Ah, from my uncle's cellar. Saved it from the Boche in '14, so we'll not leave it now! No? Yes. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Good evening, Edmond. - Settled in? - As best we could. We're here now. Left everything. We did right in leaving, Mr. Mayor? Yes, we did right. Yes. - Well, goodnight then. - Goodnight. For this first, somewhat special evening, the Mayor has decided to offer you all a drink! For once the municipality is paying a round! Come on. Don't be shy. Come on. Take a glass. A wee drink? - Oh, no. - Oh, yes! Help yourselves. - There you go. - Thanks, Mado. - Cheers, Made! - My pleasure. It'll warm you up. At least they thank you. True. Everyone thanked me but you. Thank you. Come on. A bit of hope. Tonight Sorry, private party. No entry, folks. Where are you from? Lebucquiére. I'm from Bucquoy. Still not possible, madam. Be off home with you! Tell me what you think of this. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. - You speak French? - A little. I understand it better. - Where are you from? - Scotland. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. My parents hid a Scottish officer here in this house in 1917. For almost a year. And when the village was liberated, the officer left us his bag-pipes as a souvenir. This is Black Watch. Black Watch. I wish I could have served with them. In 1914, my two brothers joined up. I was still a boy, and I went to Glasgow with my mother to see them off. And that's the last we ever saw of them. And now, look at me. Lost on the continent, just like them. My entire company died today. I've lost 143 men since the 10th of May. Always beaten back, but always with great courage. To friends departed. Mm. [ Baby crying I. You can sleep with me if you like. I'm all alone, too. I can't sleep. When I want to fall asleep, I think of something I'd really love. To see the sea, for example. Morning, Albert. That eighth bottle was a mistake. - Oh. Nine? - Yes. All right. Be right back. Got to fill another trough in the village. All right. May 7, 1940. Dear Daddy, they decided to leave. I'm going, too. I'll leave you messages on blackboards. We're going to Dieppe. Big kiss, Max. Hey, the Germans! The Germans are coming! - What? - In here. They will go away. They're only scouts. They're looking for water. Did the owner of this farm have a shotgun? No, no, there's no gun here. We let them go, no trouble, right? Hold on, hold on. What'll you tell them? That we found English cigarettes? Come on. Let's at least take a look. - Oh, shit! - All right. Rule number one, we always stay apart on the way to the house. You go to the barn, find somewhere to hide. Stay put. They'll check in the house first. Cover me. We should go call for backup. Stay here. [clangingl. Ah! Hold on. Receiving. All is well. Manipulation error. Understood. Heil Hitler! How do you know how to use that thing? We had a secret radio broadcast back in Germany. We were warning people of the Gestapo, the police raids. Albert. Your village is headed for Dieppe. Will you come with me? Well... I never did like to travel. I'd rather stay here. I know he's just a scout, but they'll be swarming here soon and out for blood. Come. And my cellar? I can get a boat back to England from Dieppe, as long as you boys know the way. Come on! Percy. - Percy. - What? - Stop the bike for a second. - What, what? - Stop the bike for a second. - What is it? - What is it? - I'll tell you later. - What for? - You'll see, you'll see. I'll show you something. I'll show you something. Come on. - You see, this is the side. - Oh, fuck you! This is it. You want to win a war, and you don't even know how to drive in France? Ridiculous! Whoa... What's the matter? We take this other road here. What for? This road is fine. We do as I say, Mr. Mayor. Max, come! Children, groupup! Come children, gather round! Come on, hurry up! Come along, in a group. Last, as usual. So, do you all remember the La Fontaine fable we learned in school? Yes! May we all recite it together? To show to all your kindness it behooves: There's none so small, but you his aid may need. Look at me, everyone! Not too fast! From beneath the sward... A rat, quite off his guard, emerged between a lion's paws. The beast of royal bearing showed what a lion he was... Look at me, Agnes! Wait for each other! Forth issuing from his forest glen... Very good! In a lion net... Look at me, Gabriel! All eyes on me, okay? Let's go! Desmaret family continue towards Poitiers. Gorzynski family buried Granny Rosa behind the church, May 17. Waiting for you at Amiens station Jean and Marthe Hombert. Pruvost Family lost little Louis, five years old. I'll go see about supplies. I'll catch up to you. - Hello. - Hello. We need to buy food, but... not at this price. No obligation to buy. We sell... so it's not that expensive. I forbid you to go off like that! Must I tie you to the wagon? Don't be angry, Miss. Are you the teacher? No, the Red Cross. These children have lost their families. We found them on the roads, in the fields. I'm waiting for a truck to Rouen. Should've been here hours ago. Is he yours? Yes. So, let's see... I'll check out the school. Be right back. Might find some petrol now. Let's find something to eat. - All right. - And drink. Mute! There's nothing on the blackboard. No message. They didn't come this way, and we're losing time. Out! Line up! On the double! Be silent. The prisoners are over here. Lieutenant, our mission is to show how we invaded France, not a zoo! To my knowledge, the French army is not just made up of negroes! It's all we could find in the vicinity. But I sent out an appeal over the radio. We'll have white prisoners. We have lots. Good. Line up the negroes in front of the monument. All of them! On the double! Lieutenant. Line up! Gentlemen! You are writing the glorious history of the Reich, of how it rose. Our people want to know how a thousand year empire was built! It's a propaganda film crew. They make movies that claim to tell the truth in every cinema in Germany. Goon! They're going to reenact how this village was taken, and the French prisoners are supposed to defend it. Will they be armed? Yeah, but only with blanks. How despicable. Look, we found this man stealing food in one of the houses. He's white! We could dress him as a French soldier. He's just a looter. I want whites, but young ones. He's far too old! Gentlemen! The French army sacrificed you by sending you to fight against our Panzers! I'm now giving you the chance to save your skins. When I give the signal, you take a rifle. Try to fight with honor. Ready? Action! Spread out and search all the houses! Search all the houses! We only have enough food left for a few days. And there's no knowing what to expect between here and Dieppe. Now you all know the situation. So, we need to decide. Sorry, Paul, but food concerns everyone, especially us women who cook it. - So, we'll all vote. - Mado, stop it. I don't agree with your proposal. But as a woman with no vote, I have no say? Stop it. Come on, gather round! Those in favor of doing like I said, raise your hand. Those in favor of the Mayor's proposal, raise your hand. So, we do it? Let's go. Go ahead. Where's the store room? Move aside. Move aside! - Do as you're told! Move! - No! Move! Well, now. Look at this! Here. Your behavior is just shameful. Your little business relies on the roads to transport your goods! On electricity for light and power! And who paid for all that? We all did! With our taxes! In times of need, such selfishness is disgusting! Send the bill to Lebucquiére town hall, Pas-de-Calais, Bertincourt canton. We always pay our debts. Now, you bless yourself. Did you too ask forgiveness for what we stole, Miss? Yes. Can you wait outside? Look. I've written your first name, Max, and my surname, Blondel, with the address of our town hall. If we ever get separated, show this to people, okay? I don't want you getting picked up and placed. Come closer. She's sweet, Pauline. Yes. We may get married. Spoken to her parents? No, it's too early. Her parents are very nice. If you had to live with them, I'm sure it'd be fine. Yes, but I'll live with my daddy. I knew I'd find you here. The Republic, trampled upon. Look. Now, everything will change. I should've quit long ago. Come off it, Paul. At the Dieppe Sub-Prefecture, you'll get new instructions, and more than ever, Lebucquiere will need a mayor like you. Remember that Post Office calendar on the wall in our kitchen? Written on it was, "Do as you please in May". I never paid it any heed. Yet it's a nice proposal, no? Once we get to Dieppe, I'll have done my mayoral duty, but I'm not doing any more. The administration there will take care of everybody. What if, in Dieppe, we took the boat to Canada? Never any wars there. You could open a cafe, and I'd farm. I heard they need labor. You really want to go? Leave the country? Why not? Both your parents and mine were victims of the last war. I lost a lung in '17 due to goddamn mustard gas. Haven't we given enough for our country? Can't it let us both live in peace wherever we like? Mama! Jacques! [ Baby crying I. Please! Max! Mado? Made? Made? I'm okay, Paul. [crying I Max! I'll be okay. Max! Max! Max! It's broken. May I'_2. Um... It's on the house. Thank you. Cheers! Dear Daddy, we stopped over here to rest. Miss is looking after me well. She is very kind. 6 gave a photo of you and me to Paufine, my sweetheart. A big hug- Max. A British officer and a civilian, Captain! Bring them here! This way! Start distributing the ammunition. - Who are you? - Do you... do you speak English? Yeah, I speak a little. I'm with the Sixth Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders. The Germans dislodged us from Arras two days ago. Since then, I've been making my way to Dieppe with this man. He's a Flemish refugee. Okay. Your papers? He lost his papers during the Battle of Arras, but I can personally vouch for him, Captain. What, um... What are you doing here? We are building an anti-tank barrage. The panzer division is headed this way. They're coming. And you're going to do what? Take the brunt of the attack while other units take their flanks? Roughly, yes. Captain. I know the people travelling with that van. Do you know where they are now? We evacuated them. Attacked by Stukas. We helped them bury their dead and cross the river Somme just behind here. We intend to blow the bridges. Did you bury a child? Why do you ask that? Where are the graves? Your son must have made it across the Somme with the others. And you should get going. Come on. Come on. You're staying here? Of course. I always dreamed of taking orders from a Frenchman. Retreating's not for me. When you get to Dieppe, take a boat to London. Go to this address. He's a staff instructor. I know him very well. Tell him I sent you. I put my name and number there, too, but give him this, because he gave it to me. You can tune into Nazi wavelengths, you can jam their signals. You could spread false information. Hit them where it hurts. I see that now. I have actually learned something being with you. It does take more than maniacs like me to win a war. Just promise me one thing. Whatever happens, get to London. Go on, go on! Quickly! Keep it moving! Goon! Go on! Keep it moving! - Go on! Hurry! - Go on! Keep it moving! Quickly! Goon! Right, everything in place? Okay, gents, let's go! Quickly! No, no, you can't cross, Miss! I'm expecting a little boy. - We're blowing the bridge! - There's a boy! - I'm sorry, Miss. - We can't leave Max! - It's too late! - You must evacuate! - We can't leave him! - It's too late. Move that cart! No! No! No! No, no! Go on. [Suzanne panting 1. No, please! No! Help. Help. Help me. Help me. What's your name? Your name? Name? My name is Max. You're German? You are German. Come here, Max. Come here. Pull on this strap. Help me, I'm dying. Come. Here. Come. Pull here. Here. Here. Come on. Ah! Ah! [crying I. How old are you? Eight. Eight? I have a little boy, too. Johann. I won't see him turn eight. Here. Here, here. Take my wallet. Give it to the first German soldier you meet. Can you do that for me, Max? Yes? You promise? Ah! [crying I Max! Daddy. Like it? It's cold, but it's good. Want some? No, thanks. MY» h°W Y°U'Ve grown! I'll have to measure you. Leaving messages on school blackboards... What a great idea! - It was Miss Suzanne's idea. - Yeah? And this, too. Last night, in the hut, I was missing her as much as you. But you know, Max... You don't need that address now. Lebucquiére, it's over. You understand? It's good to speak German, no? It's been so long. - I spoke with a German yesterday. - Yeah? With Who? A German soldier. Goon! Go, go! Whoa... [ Girl laughs I. Stop here! Here. Ladies and gents! Hello. Hello. Good day, Madam. Look into the camera, please. Sir. Have a nice day. The prisoners are ready. - Get the car. - Yes. 'Hurry u D! 'Yes! Paul, let's go! Go on, go on. Move it! All out, on the double! The prisoners between the trees. In a half circle. Oh, ho, ho. What? What? What are you gonna do with him? - You can't even play them, can you? - Steady. - Can you, you stupid bastard? - Steady! Lower your weapon! Do you know how to play them? Icould. What would you give me? Eternity... in my film. Would you let me keep my bagpipes? Do you have the authority? Of course. Play for my movie. Please. Did you enjoy that? As we've seen, the Germans are forging ahead. It looks like they're unstoppable. It's pointless going on, they'll be in Dieppe before us. The war already seems lost. I made a terrible mistake. I should never have led you from your homes into this mess. You made the right decision, we had to leave. You saw those tanks! Can you imagine what they've done to our villages? And the war can't be lost in just ten days? We haven't come this far for nothing! Take us further, to Poitiers, to Bordeaux. They'll never reach Bordeaux. I'd love to believe you, Roger. If you're up for it, go ahead. But me, I'm turning back. I'll find a bridge somewhere and go on home. And you, Suzanne? I'm going home. I stitched the Lebucquiére address inside his coat. One day I'll know what became of him. I must, otherwise it'll be unbearable. The only way to keep our grip is to return to where we belong. Our home. The Germans will respect us if we do our jobs. Suzanne is not your daughter, Paul. Let her live her life. Whoa... Why do you want to head north? Most of the people we meet are fleeing south. We're returning to our village, Lebucquiére. - I'm the Mayor. - Ah. Give me your papers. [Dialing phone 1. I have someone here who says he is the mayor of Lebucquiére. Is that on your side? Uh-huh. Go ahead. Giddy up, Hitler! Max, eyes straight ahead! Look at no one! Max! Step over here. Heil Hitler! Karl Lempke, 7th Panzer Division. I was wounded yesterday, I'm re-joining my unit. Who are these people? They took care of me. I'm helping them to get across the river. Uh-huh. Papers, please? Go ahead. BASED ON THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE WHO LEFT ALL TO TRY TO LIVE ELSEWHERE
