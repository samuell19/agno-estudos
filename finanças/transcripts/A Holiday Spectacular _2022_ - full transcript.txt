Wait. Lucy, what is it? What happened? I, I, I can't do it, Grandma. What? I'm not good enough to be Clara. Wait a minute. You got a callback. That's just because of who you are. Who told you that? One of the other girls. Well, that is nonsense. You got here on your own, okay? All right. All right. How long until your group? They said about an hour and a half. Okay. Come on. I want to show you something. What is all this? This is all Rockettes history. All of these ladies were superstars; actually, they still are. But I want to tell you something. I think that the biggest star in this whole place will be you. But I know how much it would mean to you if I got to be Clara. - Oh. - I just, I just don't want you to be disappointed if I'm not picked. The only thing that would really disappoint me is if you didn't try. One of the best things in life comes when you're really scared to do something but you do it anyway. Were you scared when you auditioned? No. But boy, when they said yes, I was terrified. But of course then I, uh, I had a lot more to lose. You know what? I think that you're old enough now to hear the entire story. While my family was busy getting ready to host the most lavish Thanksgiving dinner in Philadelphia, I turned on the TV and what I saw changed my life. It was the first year that the Rockettes ever performed at the parade, and I was absolutely mesmerized. I wished so badly that I could be one of them. I knew my family would never approve. Why not? Well, my future was already all mapped out for me, and it had nothing to do with dancing. Is that real gold, Mother? Oh, don't be ridiculous, Margaret. It's gold leaf. Perhaps we should just dip the entire invitation into diamond dust. Oh, is that an option? I wasn't serious. Well, I am serious. You're our only child, and we are doing this to the nines. I'm sure you could just do it to the sixes and be perfectly fine. What's Maxwell's middle name? I haven't the faintest idea, Mother. I also don't know his favorite book, color, food, what inspires him, what brings him joy. You'll learn all of that in time. Shouldn't I already know the man I'm marrying in April? All you need to know is that Maxwell is a good man and he comes from a wonderful Philadelphia family. Everyone agrees it's a perfect match. Good morning, dear. As soon as Maxwell arrives, we'll start brunch. Oh, there he is! Hello, my darling. You look stunning today as always. How are the wedding plans coming along? Swimmingly. Is that gold leaf. Very nice. My parents send the regards, by the way. Father has a polo match at Brandywine this afternoon. Oh. We really should go and see him play. Wouldn't that be a fine time, Margaret? Maxwell, can I ask you a question? Of course. What brings you true joy? What really makes you happy? Margaret, we were talking about polo. How about polo then? Does polo make you happy? You make me happy. Thank you. That's very nice. What's my middle name? Maury? Mary. It's Marie. Ah, as in Antoinette. Maxwell, you must tell us about your father's new horse. Didn't you pick it up at the Devon Horse Show over the summer? - Yes, we did. - A five, six, seven and eight A one and a two, a three, a four, a five and a six, a seven and eight. A one, two, three, four, a five, a six, a seven and eight. A one and a two, and a three, a four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, a three, a four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh, bravo, ladies! Bravo! Margaret, you were in fantastic form as always. Thank you. Oh, before go, I want to tell you about an exciting last-minute audition this afternoon. Come on. The Rockettes are all you've talked about since last Thanksgiving. And if I get cast, then what? I move to New York for two months? It's preposterous. Well, I'm definitely not going to get cast. But it's a great way to get audition experience. And I don't want to go on my own. Just come with me, please. Okay. For curiosity's sake, I'll go. Number 32, number 154, thank you. Congratulations, Margaret Bennett. We've been searching for three new dancers for this season, and you got the last spot. See you November 1st. Was that a blast or what? Now you know you were good enough even though you can't actually do it. Can you imagine leaving Philadelphia in the middle of planning the biggest Main Line wedding in years? Not to mention the fact your family would never allow it. You are going to tell them no, aren't you? Margaret, where have you been? I thought your class ended hours ago. I've been thinking about the wedding and how I still haven't found the perfect dress, so I went to the bridal salon to see if they had anything new. And did they? Nothing at all. So I was thinking, why don't I go to New York and meet with Gabriella Monroe? Margaret, I have tried every connection I have in the city to get an appointment with her. She is booked through the summer. Well, I have another connection. You do? Who? Remember my friend Kitty from summer camp in Maine? She's Gabriella's niece. Well, she said her aunt could see me on November 1st. That's wonderful. Oh, and of course I'll go with you. No. I'd like to go on my own. No, I'm not comfortable with you being in the city by yourself, young lady. I'll stay with Kitty. Her husband just bought a penthouse on Central Park. Oh, she married well. She must be on cloud nine. I'm sure she is. Margaret, you're here! Kitty! Oh! Are you sure you're okay with this? Of course. This is just like "It Happened One Night." You're like Claudette Colbert, running away from her wealthy family to follow her dream. I'm not running away. I'm having one last pre-wedding adventure that no one in my family can ever know about. Ooh, I should probably get to my new apartment. You're not even staying with me? The Rockettes have us in an all women's building at West 52nd and 8th, just a few blocks from Radio City. How brave? What do you mean? I just mean it's a different lifestyle than you're used to. Oh, I'm sure it's lovely. So that's just south of here, right? Is it walking distance? Not, not with all that luggage. Let's get you a cab. Oh. Remember, if my parents or Maxwell call- I'll tell them they can reach you at Radio City Music Hall. Kitty! Don't worry, Margaret. I'll tell them you're wedding shopping, which we will do together, won't we? Of course. Now, Lillian, this year please try to remember, the 10 o'clock curfew is not a suggestion, it's a rule. A young woman can't be seen gallivanting around town at all hours, understood? Of course, Rose. You, boys, you're loitering. Go on now. Shoo! Shoo! Could you possibly take those up to my room for me? Uh, they're quite heavy and I'm on the fourth floor. Ooh, I'll just wait for the doorman, I suppose. Oh! Hey! Is that a handbag or a Billy club? I'm terribly sorry, I didn't see you there. Are you hurt? It takes a lot more than a weaponized accessory to hurt a Navy man. I'm curious. Why does the Navy have you taking pictures of a lamppost? I'm on leave. And if you really want to know, I'm taking a shot of the tinsel on the streetlight. The little bit there. I saw it and thought about how it's probably been up there the entire year, just hanging on for dear life, waiting for the rest of its friends to come back for Christmas. I think my thought would've been, "Someone didn't do a very good job cleaning up in January." Well, I guess it just depends on how you look at things. Can I help you with those? Oh, no. I'm just waiting for the doorman. We don't have doormen or any men in this building, for that matter. Of course you'll find more than a few gentlemen happen upon this apartment building looking for romance. Oh. Not interested, thank you. I really was just taking pictures. Is that so? I'm a photographer, ma'am. I thought you said you were in the Navy. Oh, the Navy has photographers. I take pictures all around the ship, the bases, everywhere the Navy goes. There are no ships on West 52nd, sailor. Move on! Have a nice day, ma'am. Miss. I'm Rose, the apartment manager. Margaret Bennett, I'm new. No kidding, Maggie. I'll help with your bags. Hi. Excuse me. What do you think? This will do just fine. ♪ Santa baby, got a gift for me ♪ But it isn't very private, is it? No, because this is the common room. This is your room. I don't get my own room. I could pay extra. How much more would that be weekly? I... Oh, I spent most of my cash in the dining car on the train. There was the most gorgeous shrimp cocktail. Anyway, I'm sure we could work something out. Oh, it's nothing to do with the money, dear. First years are at the bottom of the wait list. - Oh. - Good luck, dear. What am I doing? You're helping me decorate for Christmas, that's what. But it's not even Thanksgiving yet. Oh, what can I say? I'm festive. Here, sit over there. I'm Sofia Gagliardi, by the way. And one thing you should know about me is I talk a lot. So if we're going to be friends, you got to tell me if I'm talking too much or else I'll just keep talking and talking and talking. And I'm doing it right now, and I can't believe you didn't say anything. I'm sorry. I'm Marg... Maggie Bennett from Philadelphia. Love Philly. Oh, Liberty Bell, cheese steaks, Ben Franklin. Am I forgetting anything? No, that's pretty much it. Where are you from? Bensonhurst. Brooklyn. I changed my mind, I'll finish this later. You got to change clothes. We got to be at Radio City in 20 minutes, and you're wearing a dress like we're going to the theater instead of going to the theater, if you know what I mean. Wow, that's some nifty luggage. Oh, they're just hand-me-downs. From who? Grace Kelly? So what bag's your pants in? Oh, I don't usually wear pants when I'm going out. Again, you're not going out. You're walking to work. You can borrow a pair from me. There you go. Thank you. And that. Just go back there. Chicken parm. My cousin brought it over from his restaurant on Mulberry Street. It's 10 in the morning. We rehearse six hours a day, six days a week. And then we do two shows a day for a month straight. That's a thousand high kicks a day, Maggie. You never know when you might need a late night snack. Isn't there a dining room downstairs? There is, but it's always good to have backup. That's better. Oh good. You two met. You must be Margaret. Maggie's fine. I'm Alice, resident advisor for the rookies. Any problems, any questions, you come to me. I'm right here on the fourth floor. How many years have you been a Rockette? This is my 10th year. Wow, I hope I can last that long. Oh, I'd do it forever if I could. So we are missing one girl. Janet. She's in 4C. Oh, let's go say hello. Come on. Want to come spruce up our room? Not particularly. Righto. Moving on. I'm Sofia, this is Maggie. I'm a bit of a talker, so you- I'm going to stop you right there. No need to trade life stories. Suit yourself. How come she gets her own room? There are three new girls and two rooms. The early bird catches the worm. For the record, I believe I got here before you did. Did you? I'm sure I would have heard you. So, Janet, where are you from. Cleveland. Again, don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not here to make friends. Is there a right way to take that? I'm here to make a name for myself. First stop, Rockettes; next stop, Broadway. You're going to want to make friends, Janet. It's one of the best parts about being a Rockette. We take care of each other. We're like sisters. I already have three sisters, I don't need anymore. Well, I think it's wonderful. I've always wanted a sister. How about you, Sofia? You know, we should split. We don't want to be late for our first rehearsal, right? Where is everybody? There you are. You were supposed to come through the back. Come this way. We'll just go through here. Don't be nervous. Going to be an exciting day. ts Hi, I'm Lillian. Welcome to the Rockettes. I'm Peggy. And we were all in your shoes once. And there are a lot of shoes. So many shoes. But don't worry. After your first season, they'll be completely broken in. The shoes or us? Both. All right, ladies. Let's shake some of that rust off, shall we? Basic eye-high kick line starting on your stage right angle. And a five, six, seven, eight. A one, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight. A one, two. Remember, your toe to your eye every single time. Six, seven, eight. That's it. Effortless. Yes. You'll be right there alongside them soon enough. Come on, we got to get you up to wardrobe, hmm? These are wonderful and heavy. Are you okay, Grandma? Mm. I don't think it really hit me until that moment. I was a Rockette. And a split second later, we were more nervous than before. Thank goodness we had Alice. It's okay, ladies. Drink a lot of water, stay focused; and most importantly, have a ball. You get to dance with your best friends. Day in and day out, we're here for each other. That's what makes what we do so special. All right. Remember your spacing. A one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight. Then one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Again. A one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You can do better. Again. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight. A one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Almost. One more time. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. That's it! Now, let's do that 100 more times. Hey, I'm going easy on you since it's your first day. That was going easy on us? Oh, I can't walk anymore. I need a rest or a sandwich. I know a good market a couple blocks down with a deli. A couple blocks? Oh, come on. We can do it. I'm telling you, Harriet, it's too early. Oh, Robert, it's never too early to decorate for Christmas. I think you'd put up decorations in August if I said yes. Hey, knock it off. We're not paying you to take pictures. You're not paying me at all. Is that why you haven't been to the barber? It's called paying your dues, son. I did it, you are doing it, and someday your kids will too. First he'd ave to find a girl he loves more than that camera. Can it, Cuz. Just calling it like I see it. Ha! Hello, ladies. Is there something we can help you with? We're just here to pick up some sandwiches. Oh, careful, that one's got a handbag and she's not afraid to use it. Oh, it's you? It is indeed I, me. You know each other? Unofficially. Then let's fix that. I, I'm John. And? And, and you are? I'm going to get some fruit. Uh, can I help you find anything? Just the aforementioned fruit. - Yeah. - There it is. Uh, the Jonagold apples are new. Perfect for hot cider or cold, uh, your choice. Duly noted. Uh, just to clarify, this is my parents' store. I, I, I work here. I'm not just following you around trying to show off my knowledge of seasonal produce. And what about Navy photographer? Oh, oh, that too, until July. And then a career in high pressure fruit sales? And then, uh, I'm thinking of applying to NYU to get a visual arts degree and then start a career as a photojournalist. Well, I think that's a wonderful idea. NYU is a great- Anyway, if you have any more questions about apples or anything else, I'm your guy. I'll keep that in mind. I think I just might need a sandwich every day if it means looking in those please eyes again. I thought his eyes were brown. I was talking about the guy in a deli. Who did you think I meant? Oh, no one. Don't look at me like that. I'm spoken for back home. It took you an entire day to mention that? I'm just here to dance, let's focus on that. We're still waiting! Hello? We're still out here! That's it, I'm going in. Woo! Oh! Oh. I didn't realize anyone was waiting. Woo! Oh! You used all the hot water! You can run out of hot water? Make sure your heads are back on count five. And just feel the fabric. Don't hold onto each other, hmm? You have exactly 78 seconds to change from "Wooden Soldier" costume to "Times Square," and that is the transition that we are going to work on for the rest of the day. Positions. And go. All right, ladies. All right. Right gloves. Zippers. I got you. Janet! Janet! Five seconds! Well, almost all of you made it. Now, just try it without looking like you were run over by Santa's sleigh. To hear you're getting onisd so well in the city. Oh yes, I love it. Kitty has invited me to all sorts of wonderful lunches and cocktail parties. I'm meeting oodles of important people, people who could do business with Father and Maxwell's family. Oh, how very clever of your, dear. In fact, it's going so well I think I should stay on a little longer. Oh. How long? At least two weeks, if that's all right with you. Of course it's okay. You're doing this for your future. What are you doing here? Come with me. Where are we going? To get dessert and talk, in that order. See the way you're all looking at me? That's why I didn't want to say anything. I thought maybe you came from money, but I didn't think you came from money with a capital M. I need you to understand, I'm not rich, my parents are. And there's no point in getting everyone all riled up, I'm only here for one season. And while I'm here, I'm on my own. Sure you are. Until things get hard, right? Then you can go right back to your real life. This is the most real thing I've ever done. I'm just saying it must be nice to have a safety net. I have one more thing to ask you, it's very important. Can I borrow that red coat now that I know that it's designer? Of course. You would have loved this. Are you okay? Of course. You? You have a sister? Had. A twin, actually. She died a few years ago. Being a Rockette was our dream together. The only thing that was different about us was I didn't have a hole in my heart, but now I do. I'm so sorry, Sofia. It must be so hard being here without her. I can't let it be hard, though. I know if I fall apart, my whole family will. And I have to be strong for everyone. You don't have to do that for us, though. Remember what Mr. Matthews and Alice said? We're family now. So far that's been the best part. Now, come on, let me help you with that laundry. Something tells me you had somebody else do this for you before. Alice. What is this? Your paycheck. But it's probably pocket change to you. Actually, I don't have any of my own money left, so this means everything. I really like that green coat. I like it when you wear your green coat red and I wear my red coat. And then we just- And then we look like Christmas? We look like Christmas. After Thanksgiving? Yeah. You really have to stop following me. Sofia and I were just doing a little shopping. Well, if you need me, I'll be in the shoe department asking Santa for a pair of two-tone Chanel pumps. Looking for something specific? I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Do you want to go inside? Oh, not again. I'm terribly sorry. If it turns out you're really a hitman, you're not very good at it. Excuse me. Could I see this pin? ♪ And a happy New Year ♪ This is beautiful. I'll take it. If you like, you can put it on layaway until Christmas Eve. You put a little toward it every week until you've got enough to buy it. Oh, layaway. Of course. But I'm only here until Christmas, is that enough time? It depends on how much you put in? You're not staying in New York? I'm only dancing the one season. Thank you. ♪ To you and your kin ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ Christmas is always perfect in this little town, isn't it? Yeah. But it's pretty close to perfect right here too. I should probably tell you. There's somebody waiting for me back home. You don't need to tell me that. I don't? I'm leaving soon, too, remember? And then NYU. If I had it my way, yes. I'd be learning from the best of the best. Every class is taught by photographers who have won Pulitzers or have their work on the cover of "National Geographic" or the front page at the "Times." It sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime. Not if you ask my folks. If they knew I wanted to do anything other than take over the store, they'd think I'm abandoning them. But you're not. You're following your dream. Imagine how much you'll regret it if you don't even try. I might not even get in. Then you take a different path. It's not always that simple. What would you have done if you didn't get cast in the show? I'd find a way to keep dancing. But it wouldn't be like this. In my wildest dreams I didn't think my life could ever be like this. Yet here you are. Here I am. I should probably go find Sofia. Oh, right. Of course. So I'll see you around the neighborhood? Just warn me when you're nearby so I can put on a helmet. Janet, you have to rock up on your heels and make sure you have control of the girl in front of you. - I'm trying. - Good. Just open your arms so the girl behind you can follow. Okay, everyone, attention please. The "Christmas Spectacular" opens in four days. But before that, some of you will be dancing in the Thanksgiving Day parade. Don't you want to see who got in? I know we didn't. Only half the girls perform, and we're new. Actually, a lot of the veteran dancers go home for Thanksgiving. There we are! Alice, you're not spending Thanksgiving with your family? This is my family. I'm curious. What does your family think you're doing? They think I'm in the Hamptons with Kitty and her cousins. What if they see you on TV? They won't. I'm the only one who ever watches the parade. So everybody won't get along. Back for their second year in a row, here are the world famous Radio City Music Hall Rockettes now celebrating their 33rd season. That's Sofia. Man- The Rockettes have been high kicking and- She's something, isn't she? Since 1925. She's incredible. Look at these talented ladies having a ball. I still think we should have insisted Margaret come home for Thanksgiving dinner. Oh, she's hobnobbing with New York's elite, dear. She's doing it for the family. I suppose you're right. Dessert party, fourth floor. You coming? Actually, I think I'll take a walk. I want to take in as much of the city as I can. Who knows if I'll ever be here on Thanksgiving again? - Oh, I'm so sorry, Miss. - Excuse- I suppose we're even then. Well played, sir. You think I plotted my revenge on the off chance you'd be wandering the Christmas tree lot three blocks from your apartment on Thanksgiving night? Maybe. Okay, son, were paid up. Oh, Pops, this is Maggie. She's one of the new Rockettes this year. Oh. Nice to meet you, young lady. Nice to meet you. Let's get this tree back to market. Gimme a minute, and I'll help. What? You don't think we can carry a tree. We're not that old. You stay. All right. So can I help you pick out a tree? There's one. Oh, there's another one. We don't really have room for a tree on our floor. You got to have a tree somewhere. We are living and breathing Christmas all day at the theater. I think we're covered. I was actually just going on a Christmas-in-New-York stroll. I want to take in as much of the city as I can while I'm still here. You shouldn't be walking around the city alone at night. I'd be happy to take you around, purely for safety reasons. That's all? Well, it can't be more than that, right? No. Just friends. Then yes. It's for safety. Two, please. Do you have pecans? I just don't think anyone actually likes chestnuts, is all. It's a New York City Christmas tradition. Also, the song isn't: ♪ Pecans roasting on an open fire ♪ Wait, hang on. You love chestnuts. You always say they're your favorite. Hmm, that's because of what happened next. It's so beautiful. The only thing missing is a little snow. I can make that happen. How in the world did you do that? I can always sense when it's about to snow. It's a special talent of mine. Oh. Mine's knowing when someone's not telling the truth. All right, fine. It was dumb luck. Oh, by the way, you were wonderful in the parade this morning. Thank you. I love how people react to the first few flakes of snow. It's like they're kids again. You can see it in their face. What? You see things other people don't, that's your real special skill. I think it's what makes you a great photographer. Very impressive. How did you get him to play that? I promised him a pair of my house seats. Oh. Already bartering with the vendors. You really are becoming a New Yorker. Don't you have friends and family who want to use 'em. I'm sure they're so proud of you. I'd like to think so. You don't always have to take pictures. You can join in the fun. Ah, no. I'm not much of a dancer. Well, I am. And I don't want to miss out on any Christmas magic. Come on. Come on. All right. Okay. But I apologize in advance for when I step on your toes. Oh no. What time is it? Oh no, I'm going to miss curfew. I have to go, but thank you for the company and the dance and everything. Anytime. I mean that. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Wonderful show, ladies. 1 down, 99 to go. That's so many. I'm so glad we only had to do the first two shows today. We finally have the evening off. What shall we do? How about we grab a bite? Okay. Where? You know where. Okay, missy, it's been a week since your little evening stroll with a certain Navy man. Something happened and you haven't said a word. Time to let the cat out of the bag. There is no cat. Please. It's a lion. Talk. We just ran into each other. We're friends, that's all. I don't look at my friends like that. What are you doing here? You said you didn't have a tree so brought you a tree. Oh, well, uh, Ben and I. What's this? A Christmas tree. Thanks. But I'm Jewish. Rose, what do you say? Can they bring it in? No men allowed. What about delivery men? I can throw in a sandwich, make it legit. Corned beef? Of course. Extra lean. I guess a little holiday spirit never hurt anyone. Common room, only you two. No shenanigans. Oh, that one's really pretty. - Right? - Yeah, I like that one. I like this one, the texture of it. Janet, don't you want to help? I need to rest. Come on. It's fine. Struffoli? I asked around, got a recipe from a friend of a friend in Little Italy. This is the best Christmas ever. I'm not sure your fella at home would like to hear that. I'm not sure he'd even ask. What's your favorite color? Blue, why? Middle name? Alan. And what brings you the most joy? Why all the questions? Just humor me. Okay. I'll show you. I just got these developed. The last few were my favorite. This is unlike any photo I've ever been in. My family usually sits posed, formal. I've never seen myself like this before. It's how I saw you from the second I met you. You are very talented. Have your parents seen these? Not yet. What are you waiting for? Then they'll understand why you want this to be your future. You owe it to them, to yourself. I know, but it's going to break their hearts. Just waiting for the right time. Maybe the right time is now. Hm. When I go home after Christmas, things are going to change. Haven't they already? Okay. We're all set. Who wants to do the honors? I think Janet should do it. Janet! You've got it. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Are you okay, Alice? Yes, I'm fine. You don't look fine. You know, I've been dancing since I could walk. I thought I'd be able to do this forever. And now it's time to start thinking about what's next. And I don't know what that is. Dearest Mother and Father: All is well on the Upper East Side. I've made some wonderful new friends, and every night we're dressed in the most glittering dresses you can imagine. I'm really making a mark here. Did you see me almost fall? Oh, no one noticed... We were all mesmerized at Santa trying to do a high kick. Margaret, you were wonderful. Kitty! Just give a minute. Margaret? Ah, I didn't realize you were coming tonight. I wanted to surprise you. I had no idea how talented you are. You have to tell your family about this. They'll understand once they see you up there. No, they won't. Just please don't say anything until after the show is over, then I'll take care of everything. It's getting harder to cover for you. I'll buy time. I'll tell Mother your aunt's still on the design phase. Oh, for goodness' sake. You haven't even met my Aunt Gabriella. You are still getting married, aren't you? Of course I am. I'll make an appointment for next week. Good. Now, where should we get drinks? I can't go out, Kitty. I'm going home and straight to bed. We have an early performance tomorrow. Well, then I guess I see you next time you need to use my phone or collect your mail or need help lying to your fiance and your family. I'm sorry, Kitty. It's more complicated than I thought it would be. Are you going to say anything to them? No. But you should. You owe them the truth. Are you okay? No. I don't know why I thought I could pull this off. What was I thinking? This isn't me. I don't even know who I am anymore. Well, one thing's for sure. You're definitely not Margaret. - Let's go. - Let's go. Okay. Places, ladies. Yeah! Wow. Hey. Oh, you were incredible, Maggie, just stunning. Yeah. I'm not one for dancing, but that was pretty great. Thank you. I didn't realize you were coming tonight. Well, we wanted to surprise you, but I think you surprised me even more. And you were wonderful. I'm glad you liked it. Are you okay? I'm fine. I just have a lot of my mind. I have another show to do soon so I have to go back inside and get ready. We should get back to the market, son. I want to show you how we close out the books at the end of the year. All right. Congratulations, Maggie. Thank you. So you haven't told them? No, but before you say anything, I know it's not fair to leave them in the dark like this. But if I don't get in NYU, then there's nothing to tell them. I'll be working at the store just like they wanted. So that's it? Either you give in or you give up on your dream? If you really wanted this, you'd find a way to make it happen. You're right. I do. And seeing you up there makes me even more determined to make my dreams come true, just like you. You'll never guess who's on the roll call list for tonight. Frankie Avalon. How'd you know? Wait. It really is Frank- He's coming. I am going to make him fall in love with me from the stage. Oh, what about your boyfriend back home? Hey, until there's a ring on my finger, all bets are off. Good thing you aren't engaged to Maxwell, huh? Why do you say that? You know why? Actually, no. I don't know why you keep pushing this John thing. Right now I'm focused on the show, that's all. Please, I see the way you look at him. I look at Ben the same way. And you never look like that when you talk about Maxwell, which, by the way, is almost never. That's not love. I didn't come here for love. Maybe it's one of the reasons you should stay. How are your parents? They're fine. You will be home for the Christmas party, won't you? It's practically the same guest list as our wedding. Oh, and be sure to stop at Tiffany's first and pick yourself out on a nice present. You mean a present from you? You know what you like much more than I do. I don't want to disappoint you, darling. So I'll see you in two weeks. Of course. Well, goodbye then. Goodbye. Maggie, would you go out there and talk to your friend? He's been circling the block all day like like Freddy Eynsford-Hill. I didn't see anyone. Hello? Oh, what a coincidence. I just happened to be walking by and here you are. Rose said you've been hanging around all day. Yeah, I didn't say how many times I walked by. I know this show is dark tonight. And you said you hadn't gone to see the Rockefeller Center tree yet. And I wanted to take some more photos there before I send off my portfolio, so I thought maybe we could go together. Unless you already went. No. Even though it's so close to the theater, we always had a show, or curfew, until tonight. Then I guess it's fate. It just might be. But it's so complicated, John, for both of us. The timing- Is all wrong. I know. I'm not asking for anything more than one more stroll with a friend. Are you okay? I will be. I suppose you want to take a picture of me having this big emotional moment. No. This one's just for us. You know I can't. I know. But whatever happens, and wherever we end up, we can always close our eyes and be right back here. What if I don't want to just imagine it? Then I guess you have a decision to make. There you are. I thought I was going to have to send down a knotted sheet for you in case Rose locked the doors. Where were you? I was on a walk with John. Did John give you that? Of course not. Maxwell did. What? When? About a year ago. Wait a minute. So this whole time you've been engaged? Why didn't you tell me that in the first place or literally every other time we talked about Maxwell? I thought I'd come to New York and do the show and go back to my real life. Maggie, does John know you're engaged? No. But I'm going to tell him right after I talk to my parents. I've already decided I'm calling them in the morning and telling them everything. Good. Anything else you want to tell me that you've held back this whole time? I don't like chicken parm. Okay, that's just not funny. Now let me try on the rock. Oh my gosh. Oh. Oh, a lot of women would kill for a life like yours. Are you sure you want to do this? Maggie, your friend Kitty's in the lobby looking for you. At eight in the morning? Kitty? Hi. I thought our appointment with your aunt wasn't until this afternoon. No matter, I was going to cancel anyway. You were right. It's time for me to tell my family the truth. I'm calling them right after breakfast. Margaret, stop. That's why I came here. You don't have to call your parents. Why not? Because they're on their way to my apartment right now. Oh no! That's exactly what I said. What did you do? Let's go back down, and I'll tell you on the way. I do hope my Margaret hasn't been too much extra work for you. Margaret's been a dream. You'd barely know she was here. Oh, well, the apartment is stunning. Kitty, you have made a wonderful home for you and Stewart. So where is the young man? Oh, he's away on business until Christmas. That's why it's been so nice having Margaret here. Well, ladies, the coffee was delicious, but I'm ready to go out for a big New York breakfast. So what's good around here? The hotel has a fine restaurant. Why don't you get checked in, eat, and I'll meet you after that? Well, why can't you come with us? I Have an appointment to taste different flavors of wedding cake. Margaret, you know we have a perfectly wonderful pastry chef back home. Of course. I just thought this way I could narrow down our options. Oh, that's an excellent idea. I'll go with you. Oh, that's okay! I know you don't like sweets in the morning. I'll tell you what, you go with Father, I'll go to the tasting, and I'll meet you at Gimbels. Say, 2:00 PM? Great! I have to get going. Taxi! I know, I have a lot of explaining to do. Actually, you don't. I caught everyone up. You're my new favorite soap opera after "Guiding Light." I should have told you all everything from the beginning. It's just you already looked at me differently once you found out I, I came from money, and... I was afraid if you girls knew I was engaged and not planning on coming back to the show, I would be even more of an outsider. You're not leaving the show now, are you? I don't want to. But once my family finds out- Wait, you still haven't told them? No, I had to rush right here. Uffa! Half hour ladies. This is your half hour call. Ready? To do the show? Yes. To talk to my parents? It doesn't matter if I'm ready, it's now or never. Oh good. I forgot to show you one more thing with the payroll taxes. I have something I want to show you first. What's this? It's my application for NYU's Fine Arts program for when I get out of the Navy. You won't have time for college. You'll be too busy here. Well, that's the thing. I, I'm not sure this is where I'm meant to end up. So you'd rather take pictures of Christmas trees than carry on the family's legacy? It's not about Christmas. It's about me being a photojournalist, professionally. I, I, I got a real knack for it, Pop. You have a responsibility to this family. Ben is family too. And he would make you so proud if you just gave him a chance. It says Slater and Son, that's you. We work night and day to have this, to give it to you, and now you want to just throw it all away? That's not what I'm doing. I'm trying to do what's best for everyone. Taxi! Oh, this is so much better. Now, while your father is not with us, I perhaps will buy his Christmas gift. And you should get something from Maxwell. Maggie. I'm so sorry, Mr. Matthews. Something is obviously going on with you. You can talk to me. My parents are here. They think I'm in New York to have a wedding dress made, and they don't know I'm a Rockette. They would never approve. And I'm afraid of what will happen if I tell them the truth. At some point, Maggie, you're going to have to just let go of what other people expect you to be and just be who you are. Take the rest of the day off, we'll have a swing cover for you, and go do what you have to do for yourself. Hmm? Thank you. I don't know, she's... Oh, you look much better now, dear. Are you ready for dinner? Yes. But I've been trying to reach Maxwell all day. I've tried him at the office, the club, his house. I think you'll be able to reach him very soon. Can we ask for a quiet table? I really need to talk to you about something important. Actually, we already have a table right over there. Are you surprised, darling? You have no idea. Thank you. Just in time. Would you like a cocktail, darling? Ah, yes. A double old fashioned, please. Easy on the water. Isn't that basically a straight bourbon? Is it? Mother, Father, Maxwell, I have something to tell you about my time here in New York. Wait, before you do, I have something for you. An early Christmas gift. Thank you, Maxwell. I'll open it right after we talk. Open it now. Don't be rude. You couldn't stop talking about them after you saw them at the parade. So as much as I loath going to any sort of ballet. I figured I could grin and bear it for one night, for you. See, they're for Christmas Eve. Look at her. She's so happy. She's speechless. Thank you, Maxwell. It really was very thoughtful. I can get you something else if you don't want to go. Oh no. I'm definitely going because, because I'm in the show. Uh, I'm sorry. I, I don't understand. That's what I wanted to tell you. I didn't come to New York to have a wedding dress made or register for gifts or make connections or visit Kitty. I came here because back in October, I auditioned for the Rockettes and they picked me. I'm sorry. I think I, I'm missing the joke here. This isn't a joke. I really am a Rockette. Stop it, Margaret. We know you'd never do such a thing. Just come to the show. See for yourself. This isn't something to be ashamed of, it's something to be proud of. Oh, now look what you've done. You've upset your mother. Is this all true? This life we planned, we didn't plan it for ourselves, did we? This was all put together by our families. Are you really okay with marrying someone you don't even love? Darling, I'm not sure anyone in our position marries for love. Because if I'm being honest, I don't believe true love exists at all. But it does, Maxwell. And I think we both deserve the chance to find it. I see. I'm sorry, Max. Don't be sorry, darling. You're happy here. How can I be upset about that? Thank you. So are you ever coming home? I think I am home. Max? Where's he going? Back to Philadelphia, I imagine. Good. We'll stop by Kitty's, pick up your things, and we can all catch the last train home. My things aren't at Kitty's, they're at a women's boarding house. And I'm not going back with you. I'm staying in New York, permanently. But that's preposterous. You can't make it in this city by yourself. Yes, I can. But you're giving up your future. And for what? To dance? That's what you don't understand, Mother. It's about so much more than that. It's about the friendships, the camaraderie, the pride we have in what we do. We make each other better, not just as dancers but as strong, confident women who can make their own dreams come true. I've heard enough. If you're not at the hotel in two hours, Margaret, don't bother coming back home at all. You would cut me off from my family for following my dreams? I'm trying to save you from making the biggest mistake in your life. My only mistake was hoping you'd understand. Elisabeth, let's go. Elisabeth. (g-Hi. How did you- Ben gave me your address. Is that your application? It is. I was just going to drop it off. That's wonderful. When will you find out if you got in? While I'm at sea? So when I get back, I'll either be doing Slater and Son or this. I suppose that means you told your parents. I did, but they don't understand. I'm not judging their choices, I just wanted to make my own. So did I? And I have. I have a lot to tell you. I, I, I need to drop this off. Do you have time for a walk? As a matter of fact, I do. Maybe I should have written a letter to Santa too. You think he knows anyone in admissions? Well, if he doesn't, I'm sure my grandfather does. He's on the Board of Trustees. You didn't think to tell me that until now? There's a few things about my family I didn't mention. I already know, Maggie. You do? Your family is rich. Sofia let it slip to Ben. Yes, it's true. But I'm on my own now, completely, that's what I wanted to tell you. I broke off my engagement, John, and I'm staying in New York. So when you get back- Stop, back up. You were engaged? Ben didn't tell you that part. No. Oh. Okay. Uh, I was engaged, but we're both from prominent families, you see? So it was more of a marriage of convenience, it wasn't real love, not like, not like what I know is possible. I wish you would have told me all this before. But we were just friends. Isn't that what we said? I wasn't ready to tell you everything, but now I am. I just needed time to figure things out for myself. But I made my choice. I choose New York and being a dancer, and, and you. I thought you'd be happy. How can I be happy? I told you everything about myself, and it turns out I didn't know you at all. You do know me. You helped me see who I am. You told me over and over I owed it to my family to tell them the truth, and this entire time you were lying to yours. But I did tell them. Only when you had no other choice. You knew that if it didn't work out, you would just go back to Philadelphia and pretend like none of this ever happened; but me, I'm risking everything. Well, then let me at least talk to my grandfather. Why? 'Cause you don't think I can make it in on my own. I'm not saying that at all. I care about you. I just want to help you. Did your grandfather help you get into the Rockettes? I did that on my own. And that's how I want to do this, on my own. The show wasn't the same without you. Are you okay? Never better. Rose said I could stay at the apartment during the off-season while I look for work. And I have a lead on a sales job at Gimble's. Maggie, did you talk to John? I did. It didn't work out. It's fine. I came to New York to be a dancer, not to fall in love. I should have just focused on the job, that's what matters. Until you can't do the job anymore, then what? What's going on, Alice? I think it's time I should listen to my body and hang up my tap shoes. So in three days, when this show is over, so am I. And I do not know what to do next. This show is everything to me, it made me who I am. And I, I just don't want to leave. We don't want you to leave either. But I know one thing for sure, no matter where any of us are, we'll always be sisters. I know mine would have loved you girls so much. Really, Janet. Nothing? You don't have to do this alone anymore, Janet. We're your friends. But that's just it. I never let myself have friends. Everyone I met was just the competition. And you girls have stood by me no matter how hard I pushed you away. And I tried hard. We know. You helped me the most, you know? Your friendship is the best Christmas present I ever could have been given. I just don't want this to end. None of us do. Nothing like a piece of pie after a good cry, I always say. I don't have anything to say. My father built this business for him then for me, and I thought someday for you. It's our legacy. But don't you see? You made me into a man who could see beauty in the simple things: in family, in hard work, in sacrifice. Don't you see, Pop? The store isn't your legacy, I am. Oh, Robert. You can really make a living doing this? I really can. And the Slater name will be under every single picture. It's good advertising. Is something still wrong, Johnny? Uh, who are you here to see? - Maggie Bennett. - Margaret Bennett. I'm her mother. Sorry, she already left. Next show starts in two hours. I guess we'll have to come back. I'm sorry. How do you know my daughter? Oh, I'm sorry. How rude of me? I'm Harriet Slater. John Slater's my son. It's sad what happened. It really seemed that John had found his perfect match. I thought that if I could come talk to Maggie I could maybe figure out a way to help. I'm sorry, I, I, I didn't know about your son. You didn't? No, I just came back to convince my daughter to stop this nonsense and come home. Have you seen the show, Mrs. Bennett? No, I haven't. If you had, you wouldn't want to talk her out of that. It's like when I saw my son John's photographs, I knew that that's what he was meant to do too. But I think they were meant to do it together. John loves her. Does Margaret love him? I need to make things right. We both do. I can't believe this is it, our last show. Hmm. And my parents never saw it. Maybe they'll come around next season. Speaking of next season. Alice, can we talk? I know what you're going to say, Mr. Matthews. I know that this is my last season and- On-stage, perhaps. But I've seen how much you help everyone here, how selfless you are, and how much these girls look up to you. I think every one of these girls came into my office this week to tell me how much they love you and need you, one in particular. The way you stood by Janet and brought her along, that's the sort of leadership we're looking for around here. So, so what are you saying? We would like to offer you the position of dance captain. You'd make sure the girls know their choreography, run rehearsals and maybe fill in now and then. Merry Christmas, Alice. Merry Christmas, Mr. Matthews. Ladies, have a good show. Hmm? Thank you. Thank you, everyone, especially you. Anything for a friend. Five minutes, ladies. Oh. This just got delivered for you, Maggie, from Gimble's. I didn't order anything. For Maggie, who will always be part of Christmas in New York. Love, John. Hmm. He must have paid for this before everything happened. He did love me, and I loved him. I'm so sorry, Maggie. It's fine. At least now I know for sure how love feels. Are you sure you want to keep it? You don't think it'll remind of you what you lost? No. It reminds me of how far I've come. Places, please, ladies. And I didn't even know if it was going to fit. And then you helped me zip it up. You were absolutely wonderful. I couldn't be more proud. Look at you. You're just glowing, Maggie. You look so happy. You called me, Maggie. I know. I rather like it. So do I. I can't believe you're here. I came back to get you to change your mind. Mother- But I made a new friend and she changed mine. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I was so busy worrying about how it looked to everyone else that I didn't give you a chance to be yourself. And look at you. You followed your heart. And look what you've accomplished. I'm so proud of you. Father isn't here, is he? Oh, he'll come around, don't worry, I'll make sure of it. I only let him think he's in charge of this family. And I spoke to John before the show. He's wonderful, Maggie. Don't let him go. You were wonderful. - Thank you. - Excuse me. You got the pin? I can't believe you did this. I love it. I'm so sorry about what happened, John. I pressured you to risk everything without telling you the truth about myself. And I need you to know, I never meant to imply you couldn't make your dreams come true on your own. You have nothing to apologize for. No one should have understood the kind of pressure you were under from your family more than me. But it seems like you're working things out. I think so. How did our mothers even meet? Long story short, they both wanted to make things right. And? So far so good. You want to see the view I get every night? It's beautiful. Isn't it? Like Christmas every single day. Actually, I was talking about you. You're not so bad yourself. I like to dress nice for important occasions, like the night a man tells a woman he loves her. There's no way I could leave for six months without telling you that. I love you, Maggie. I love you too. And when you get back, I'll be right here waiting. Even if you don't know if you're going to end up with a photographer or a grocer? I just want to be with you. This pin always reminds me of that Christmas and how I became the woman I was meant to be. And I became a lot stronger too. Lucy, just like you, you can do this. Thank you, Grandma. I should have known this is where you snuck off to. Look what Grandma gave me. Oh, well, I can't think of a better legacy. And it all started right here. The happiest night of my entire life.
