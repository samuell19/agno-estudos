Paris, January 1995 It shouldn't have fucked up. Your information was bad, Turk. I almost got killed because they knew. It's Moltes? Shit! We don't move yet. The snitch is at this table. He's got 30 seconds to confess. Your brother's shirt. Do it. Your shirt. What have you done, little brother? Sorry, Turk. I'm gonna kill you! Fucking traitor! So, here you are. Mister Molte. Mol-tes. Who cares. The Boss. The Terror. Mr. Everyone's-Afraid-of-Me. Your presence is an honor. I hope we'll be worthy of it. On the outside, maybe you were a star, a hero, the boss. But in here, you're no one. You're an extra. There's only one boss here, and that's me. Capisci? Yes. Yes who? Yes boss. Here are the rules. You behave, and all goes well. Or you're a smart ass. But then, I'll make your life miserable. Trust me about making people miserable, it's my specialty. Capisci? Think it over carefully. It's me. It's me. You can settle in. That's your toilet. Are you crazy? You idiot. 7 years later... What's the news, guys? Tomorrow's it. The laundry delivery at 11am. Moltes... Are you any good with girls? About like anyone else. It's about my wife. I feel like with my wife... it's not like before. That happens. What would you do? I'd just try to work it out. I'd go home all cheerful, sit down for dinner. Eat dinner with her, make her laugh. And fuck her to death. To death? To death, you lucky shit. If she says no? If she says no, give her a good beating. Hey, Reggio, did you play my lottery numbers? - I know them by heart. - Can I have the ticket? Tomorrow. My wife played them this time. But we fought last night. You trust your wife. That's very amusing. "You trust your wife." Tell me, Moltes. Speaking of amusing. I hear some jokers are planning to check out of here early. You think I'm a nitwit, no? You just told me your family problems, and I listened to you. I answered sincerely. I get out in 47 days, and you think I'd get messed up in an escape? You do take me fora nitwit. Just doing my job. Then let me finish mine, okay? And you deal with your wife. Not there, I just mopped it. Eat a nice dinner. Fuck her to death. Give her a good beating. Eat dinner. Fuck her. Good beating. Carino! I'm home! Pauline? - What's all that? - Hi. I've got great news! You've got a cell phone? Tri-band. I'll need it. Hello! Yeah, I'm hurrying. Yeah, it's great. See you at the airport? Okay. Thanks. Ciao! May I know where you're going? You know my friend Anna? The one on the Desert Rally. Medical crew. Remember? No. She broke her leg, so I'm replacing her. - What? - Isn't it great? No it's not. Pauline, think about it. Think of all the people who need you here. Your patients, the hospital... Everything's arranged. And it'll do us some good. We need some breathing room. Don't worry, it'll be fine. You're not going. May I know for what reason? You can't leave on a whim. Africa's dangerous. The diseases. - Malaria. - Vaccinated. - Yellow Fever. - Vaccinated. - Cholera. - Vaccinated. Dysentery. See, there's no vaccine. Eyelid infections. Jean-Claude had it. Listen to me, carino. Here's what we'll do: you make me dinner... Dinner? Get a pizza if you're hungry! My taxi's waiting. Put down that suitcase! Don't make me say it in Spanish. Let me go. You're asking for it. For what? There, for that. Never do that. Never! Wait, let me explain! It was in the wrong order. I was supposed to eat first. Then fuck you to death. Pauline, wait! Let me explain, it's a mistake! If you leave now, it's over! Don't bother coming back! I'll burn your bull collection! Okay, fine. Get lost, good riddance! Slut! Mr. Martinet! Hot, isn't it? Fine. Get lost! I'll be fine without you. - Food poisoning? - Suicide attempt. The neighbor found him. He drank a gallon of dish soap. - Vomiting? - And more to come. Take him to have his stomach pumped. Depressed? No, he's a prison guard. I see... We'll give him an enema he'll remember. Please, have pity. No enema. Please, no enema. Where am I? Number35. Number48. Can you put the lottery back on? Number9. Number44. Number33. Holy moly. Shit. 15 million. Oh fuck. The ticket. Pauline. Shit! Breakfast. - Where's Reggio? - Out of commission. - Why? - Sick leave. What? For how long? Undetermined. Visitor at 9am. Bastard. The Turk got out last week. He's counting your days. If he finds me, he finds me. What is it? I need a big favor. I'm a dead man. She told me not to give you her number. Let me explain. What I'm saying is she's got something that's mine. I need to get it back ASAP. She's in Africa! I know that, but I need that ticket. It's life or death. Life or death, Anna! Is that the best you can come up with? Give me the fucking number, you bitch! Sorry. Anna, forgive me, please... I'm a dead man. Moltes has escaped from the Sante prison, with two other prisoners, J. Monthieux and M. Deschamps. The three fugitives apparently escaped in a laundry truck. We now have comments from Mr. Duquenois, Moltes's lawyer. I know my client well. He does not make rash decisions. If he has escaped, he surely has his reasons. Which are? Only he can answer. I'm definitely a dead man. The police are on alert or the man of a thousand faces... With only 6 weeks left to serve, Moltes took everyone by surprise. Police are on the lookout for the car stolen by the fugitive... -It's me. -Where are you? In the car. Open the glove box. Perfect. Did you find my guard? Avenue Guy Moquet, number 16, in Vitry. Don't lose him, I'm on my way. Moltes's dramatic escape might be linked to last week's release of Mustapha Hamel, aka the Turk, his formeraccomplice... He swore to avenge his brother. Police fear a gangland killing. All cars: Moltes was sighted leaving a parking garage in a gray 406, 3 minutes ago. Block the whole area! Avenue Roosevelt is OK. Turn right. Police! Give yourself up! Come on! Get outta my way! Shit! Moltes. Pauline? You asshole. Moltes, I can explain. I can explain everything. I'll explain: you've got 30 seconds. Where's my dough? You won't believe me, but it's all a mix-up. 30 seconds goes fast, Reggio. I didn't steal it. I'm your friend. - Right? - 20. It's all your fault, you're the one who fucked up. About Pauline. I slapped her like you said, but it didn't do the trick. Ten. She left me. She went to Africa, with your ticket. She's in Africa, for the Rally. Zero. You're making me do this! Stop bullshitting me! I swear it's true. If I had it, I wouldn't be here! Think about it! What's that smell? Gas. My suicide. It's Pauline. I put your fucking lottery ticket in your fucking fanny pack. I've lost everything. No more house. No more wife. No more life. How long for the passports? The papers are nothing. It's the rest. For you it's easy, but a face like his takes a little longer. Going somewhere? Reggio... Until I find my ticket, you and I are inseparable. Wherever you go, I go. Your wife has my ticket, and she's in Africa. So we're going to Africa, together. Capisci? Yes. Yes who? Yes boss. I'm warning you, I get carsick. Turk... What do you want? A new hairdo? Moltes didn't have the balls to leave by the front door? I was planning a party for him. Where is he? Up your ass. You think I'm your brother? Don't even mention my family. Got some new fish? No one on earth will ever make me snitch. Tell me, do your fish like brains? Ask them. For the last time: where is Moltes? He won the lottery. And he screws you. Some nurse has gone off with his ticket. That asshole. Moltes, do we get dinner? Can't you see I'm not Moltes! There's always food on the plane. MOLTES ESCAPES What an old picture. Look at that face. As for us, I can guarantee we won't get sick. I've got everything. This is for malaria. And this I'll take now. But you've gotta be careful. Because last time I took too much of it... And all my eyelashes fell out. I'll just take one more. You never know. I get diarrhea easily. This is for my ears. If I don't use any, I get these necroses. I can't take the sun. I got them last year in Touquet. My ears itch, I scratch, and it gets infected. And then it rots. With no treatment, you lose the ear. I wouldn't want that. Want some? No. What? Martinet? What're you doing here? I can't believe my eyes. Taking another vacation! Do I know you? - Do I know you? - Martinet, it's me... No, you don't know the gentleman. - Yes I do. - No, you don't. I guess I don't know you. A mistake. Excuse us. We've gotta go. Come on! I know. No, you don't know! If we get caught, what'll happen? They send us away, both of us. Both on the same side. And what happens to a guard then? Gang bang? You choose. I like this game. Nice game! BAMAKO, AFRICA This is a cool game... I've got it down! I win every time. I beat you, and I beat you. Answer it. Okay. Listen here... Pick up two guys disguised as blacks arriving from Paris. Don't lose them. Of course. Who was it? It was about a job. For some guy called the Kurd. We've gotta pick up two clients, at the airport. Disguised as blacks. Moltes and Reggio. Stop playing with your teeth, it's disgusting. Put them back in. Moltes. How's this? Where's the toilet? What's wrong? You've got to stop calling me Moltes! Do I look like Moltes? Do I? Well... A little bit, yeah. Okay, go take a leak. Go. I do know you, though. Shut up already. It's no problem. I've got lots more. You don't need it anymore. I'll go buy clothes. Wait here. Want me to come? Absolutely not. God it's hot. Nope. Keep looking. Stay here. I'll get a taxi. - Don't move. - Okay. Remove the tag. It looks stupid. Excuse me. Car is yours? Speak French? Me... must go Bamako. Desert Rally, okay? Give good reward. Baksheesh? Money? Get lost. Nice hats! Moltes. I need to get a hat! Need a taxi? How far to Bamako? 11 kilometers. Is it the same distance? Kilometers are all the same. Not necessarily. In the U.S., they count in miles. Do you know how long a mile is? Yes, I do. So, how long is it? I know, okay! You don't know. He doesn't know. Guys, do you know how long a mile is? 1.6 kilometers. Their hair is nice. How do they do it? It's wool. Wool! They knit with hair! They took the bait. I liked those young men. Shut up. Blow it up. Watch this. Blow it up. What happened? It didn't go boom. Gimme that. This isn't the boom thing! Shit! Stupid fucking car! - I forgot my hat. - Who cares! Excuse me. - Yeah? - Are you with the race? Bingo, buddy. Is Pauline Reggio here? Who? Pauline Reggio. With the medical crew. You sure? She's about this tall, Spanish, sweet face. With cocksucker lips and a huge snout. Hold this fora second. She's his wife, show some respect. - I was just joking. - Very funny. - Where is she? - In the lead truck. The rotation was 2 hours ago. She's out front. Where is the advance point? Speak up boy, I can't hear you. Bakel. "Cocksucker lips." You forgot "huge snout". Now for a means of transportation. What kind of transportation? - A boat. - Are you kidding? Are you done? Just keep watch. Let's take a Toyota! I really like Toyotas. That's ours. The blue one. Hi Jean-Louis! Who's Jean-Louis? It doesn't matter. Just look relaxed. Come on. Get in! No point overdoing it. Over there for the start! Go ahead, get yourself noticed! What? Go ahead, get yourself noticed. I hear you. Cool, isn't it? Who is that asshole? Bamboola, where's Moltes? My brothers have him. - We'll go meet them. - And the nurse? We'll find her, Kurd. There are no secrets from us here. Hey, Bamboola... Call me Kurd again, and I smash your face in. Got it? Follow me, Kurd. Schlesser, two-time winner and leader of this year's Rally, is now at the starting line. It'll be interesting to see how the champion manages his lead in the overall ranking. Look. By my thumb, which is long, we're only 300km from Bakel. We're also in a fucking mess. You think? True, we're not quite on the line. Can't you keep still? Move up a little. Shut up. Fine. Just trying to help. My guy likes onions. Are you taking me fora ride? Don't worry, Kurd. This is the place. The brothers won't be much longer. Let me give you the guns, Kurd. Enough to blow the guy sky high! I wouldn't wanna be him. Check it out. We lost the two jokers. I'm in deep shit. But we're looking for the nurse. I'll improvise with the Kurd. We lost Moltes. Kurd, did you hear me? I'm the Turk! Too heavy. Gotta do everything myself. Hey bro, we found the nurse. In Bakel. Bakel? The Kurd? Gimme my brother. I can't do that. He's dead. What? He used the wrong word. Your mother used the wrong word! I'm gonna fry your ass, Kurd! - Wait, I'll put him on. - Fucker! Bastard! What do we do now? We go straight to Bakel. If we're lucky, we'll get there first. This is great, Moltes! He's trying to pass! Don't let him! - Don't let him pass! - Shut up! Bump him! - Don't let him pass! - Stop it! - Why are you slowing down? - To let them pass. No way, go for it! Stay on his ass, Moltes! We're slowing down! Come on, faster! Stop it! You're a coward! Drive, goddamn it! We should've taken the Toyota! I think Schlesser's got a problem with his new navigator. We're not here to win the race. We're here to find your wife and my ticket. You got that? You got that? We're okay. Come on... piece of shit! What do we do now? - You thought he would stop? - Why not? Forget that, Turk. I've got an idea. Hey, idiot... Need a tree? I'm the tree. Good. Very, very good. - Why are we stopping again? - My arms hurt, okay? We're never gonna get there. What? Nothing. Are you up to driving? I thought you'd never ask. Move over. I'd prefer you wear your seatbelt. - It's safer. - Just drive. Nowthat... Move, damn it! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Stop! It's okay, really. You're digging us in, stop! It'll work! It won't work at all! Look at that, "it'll work." Come see how well it worked. You're worthless. A real ball and chain. What? What's the problem? It's nothing. Just some sand in the tires. It's no use hollering like that. Especially since I was driving so you could sleep. - You should thank me. - Thanks. And now? A wedge under the tire, give it some gas, and we're off. It's no big deal. You're really pathetic. Why? The car's half buried, we can't move it, and it's almost dark. You know, Moltes, you really tend to lose your cool when things get tough. - What are you doing? - Scaring snakes. - Snakes? - I read it in a book. What are you gonna do with your money? Find someplace to grow old in peace. Don't you have a dream? Why, do you? Do you wanna see? I've always got it with me. Look at this. My dream. The Forsythe PS30. Turbo diesel. Wood and leather interior. 2 bunks. 180 sq. feet for your enjoyment. My wife and I like adventure. Touring the Loire Chateaux, every evening in a different park. You put out your table. What's holding you back? 35,934 Euros. Including tax. When you have big dreams, they're always unattainable. If we find my 15 million, I'll buy it for you. No kidding? Why would you do that? We're a team, no? Thanks. You know, it's not much, but if you throw in 2000 more Euros, you can get the Imperator. Top of the line, with panoramic veranda, and full-service toilets. It's the best camper there is. Let's go for the Imperator then. No reason not to. Where's the buggy? Friend. We... friend. Who are these guys? What do they want? Tuaregs. I'll handle it. Their cultural codes are very complex. First, you identify the chief. I think it's him. With the gun. We... France! World Champs! Soccer... Me... France... chief. Chief of prisoner. Prisoner... bad... thief. Like you... thief. Steal dune buggy. Okay, you can keep it. Buggy... gift. Gift for you. We must go Bakel. No, it's a camel. We say camel. That's me, Reggio. Fanny pack, mine. He wants it. No, not that. - Not my fanny pack. - Give it to him. It's all I have left. What do you give me? Exchange. Ferrari! What are we waiting for? I'm waiting for him to get up. That could take all night. Do something. I don't know how these things work. I'll do it myself. I knew I should sit in front. Do they bite? How should I know if camels bite? Listen here, Chuwbacca. In the desert... Look at me. Maybe you're the boss with your Bedouins. But here, you're nothing. So, two choices: you play the game, and everyone's happy. Or you're a smart ass, and I make your life miserable. Got it? You're making me miserable! What? He didn't speak French! - I retain water. - Drop your damn diseases! I'm gonna get a necrosis. I'm thirsty. - There's not enough water. - I'm thirsty. One sip. It's all we have. I can't do it now. Why not? You put your mouth on it. It grosses me out to drink after someone else. I should've gone first. It's too late now. So die then. Die yourself. Fuck. Fucking sand in my face. You drive now. Front or back, it's all the same to you. Let's take a leak. I'll never get used to it. What's with the Bedouin? You just lie back down, while I finish. That's right. Scream. We will destroy you. Look, there's something over there. Where? Higher up the dune. - I don't see anything. - A mammoth. A big mammoth. It's a mirage. Why would someone ride a mammoth in the desert? I dunno. It's a mirage. Good day, gentlemen. Hello. How can I help you? - Some water? - Of course. Flat or bubbles? Vichy, Orangina? How do you intend to pay? Dollars? Euros? Come here, I'll tell you how we'll pay. Hey, bottle-openers! If I see you girls again, I'll use you up like a roll of TP! I have an idea! I swing back and forth, and you catch me with your teeth. Then you chew the rope. Okay? Now! Fuck... That's my hand! Hey Turk... Are you okay? See how pointless it is to ask nicely? A good old-fashioned punch works wonders. It didn't work for me last time. Hey, Mr. Rent-it. How do I dial France? Who're you calling? - A friend of my wife. - Why? To get Pauline's number. Are you telling me you've known how to reach her from the start? Yeah. I'm gonna kill you, Moltes. Can you hear me? I can't hear you. - Anna, it's Francis. - Great timing! I'm in a hurry, let me explain. Listen... -Are you sick? -It's a camel. Anna, I really need Pauline's number. Don't use all my credit! Shut up! - No, not you. - Gimme that. Hello? Hi, Moltes here. -The killer on TV? -Yes, the killer on TV. Listen up. Either you give us that number, or you sleep in the morgue tonight. - I'll look. -Take it down. If we hadn't come by, they'd have died in an hour. But what are you doing here? Window shopping. Conchita, don't you have some windows to wash? It works, it's ringing! We're rich! I mean, you're rich. Pauline. It's for you. - Hello? - Pauline? - Francis? - How are you, darling? The lottery ticket! Moltes's ticket... from before you left. You've got the validated ticket, you know the one... Didn't you get my message? On the answering machine. It's in your fanny pack! The fanny pack? Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. Why? Did you win the lottery? Let me down. No, that was Moltes. Moltes! Him again! We got cut off. I told you so... Not to give the fanny pack. - Hello? - What is this? Shut your face! You. Over there. Give me Moltes! Who's speaking? Give me Moltes! Who is this? Tell him the Turk sends his regards... Some guy called the Turk sends his regards. The Turk? Gimme Pauline. Tell him I'm gonna smash his face in, shred his guts, and tear his eyes out! He's gonna smash your face, shred your... Gimme that! Turk? It's Moltes. What's your problem? It's your problem. Gimme the ticket, or I off your pal's wife. The woman for the ticket? Where are you? Where are we? Between Bakel and Touba. Between Bakel and Touba. And you? Where are we? Between Bakel and Touba. Closer to Bakel or Touba? Closer to Bakel or Touba? / 50?? 50. Are we closer to Bakel or Touba? - Same difference. - Goddamn it! Fucking piece of shit country from hell! Don't blow a fuse. You wish. Meet me tomorrow, in Touba! At noon! - Where? -In Touba! Where in Touba? - At the church! - There is no church here. You're a fucking pain in my ass! At the mosque. We'll be there. What was that about? A woman for the ticket? What woman, my wife? And who's that Kurd character? Turk. A professional associate. A professional associate? Who wants to shred your guts? What's he gonna do to Pauline? - Nothing. - What nothing? Because she's worth 15 million. May I have my phone? Shut up. So where's the fence? They usually sell their loot to Saddam. - That joint over there? - Yes. - Look, the short one. - Don't stare. - Let's go. - No. Let me go, please. It's between him and me. Let me settle this... my way. Hi, One-tooth. Remember me? "Ferrari, Ferrari!" Listen up, I'll make it short. You have something that's very important to me. My fanny pack. Far be it from me to be aggressive... What happened? Nothing. - What happened? - Nothing. - Where's Moltes? - He's gone. Oh, fuck! What's wrong? There he is! That's him! Let me handle it. - There you go. - You're a real star, Nicolas. What was in it? Just personal stuff. That's all? And 15 million. - In cash? - I don't feel very... - Cash? - Lottery ticket. Who are you? Thank God. The ticket. Good. Now we find Pauline, hand over the ticket, and go home. I don't think so. It's what you said. I changed my mind. We go our separate ways now. Hold on a second. You can't do that... You said we're a team. And Pauline? This was my problem. Pauline is your problem. Listen, Mr. Kurd. We're all adults here. This is absurd... Surely you agree. Listen, Mr. Kurd. Let's be reasonable. Listen Kurd, two things... I've got one thing to say. Touch my wife, and you're dead meat! Got that? Come on. Let's get a room now. Until tomorrow. Thanks, Moltes. You're a great guy. Shut up already. You're right. I'll shut my mouth. Not one more word out of me. Do I have a view? Of course, sir. About your swimming facilities. How do you disinfect? Disinfect, the pool. How do you disinfect? Hydrolysis, or chlorine? I don't know, sir. Could you ask your... It's important. I get these ear necroses and I wouldn't want to have to sue you. Give me the key! Hydrolysis or chlorine? Do you have a suite? Can't you see I'm talking? Can't you see I'm talking with him? So be nice, and wait behind the line, okay? What line? The courtesy line, sir. If you can't see it, imagine it. So impolite. So? I don't know, sir. Can he call me back? It's important, it's medical. And you, sir, you can't learn courtesy. It just comes naturally. Stupid Gypsy. So, a suite? Yes sir. - What are you doing? - She bit me. Good for you! It's nothing. Crazy young lovers! Keep winking Conchita, and I'll use your face to mop the floor. - Fuck you. - Shut up and move. I'll show you. Go to the room. It's funny how I look so good in these exotic clothes. I really think... they flatter my form. I probably have African blood. But I got an ensemble for you. Blue. It suits your skin tone. It'll bring out your energy. You'll look less pale. Are you listening? You... You're sulking. What's wrong? It's never easy meeting old friends again. But it'll be fine. Trust me. I've had lots of tiffs, but it always works out. I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding. What made him so angry? Anything can be forgiven. I'm your friend, talk to me. What did you do? I killed his brother. I see. But... Killed... killed? How do you like the decor? It sucks. Get lost already. Go get me an Orangina. Are you stupid? Get lost! Get lost! And take this. Fine, go to the pool if you want. Holy moly. What floor? Ground floor. Hot, isn't it? After you. Excuse me. Can I ask you something? Are you free tomorrow? Conchita... Do you mambo? His taste is terrible. See that? Conchita knows how to mambo! You really remind me of someone. When you smile. Smile again, to see. I saw you in a movie. What was it again? A detective, who beds all these girls in English cars. I can't remember his name. No big deal. As I was saying, that's my plan. You stand behind me. If anything goes wrong, you step in. It's too long to explain, the better. And I need to... keep my mouth shut. It's gonna blow. Two white guys. A blonde with a girlie haircut, and a dark one, unpleasant. Room number? Hey you, wait! Can I call the desk from your room? I forgot my key, and I don't want to wake my friend. Thanks. He's kind of out of it. I'd prefer not to wake him. Did you throw a party? Is this it? - You sure? - Yeah! - What are you doing? - Come on! My hair! Asshole! Excuse me, but can I... I know you. The jerk from reception. I'll give you some disinfectant. Room service. What the fuck is this? We're gonna get you, Kurd. Oh really? It's a bloodbath! Moltes. Turk... He's the Turk? Oh, shit. Where's the woman? We've got business first. If you hurt my Pauline, we'll get you! Shoot. Shoot him. Let's do it the old way. It's gonna blow. - Whadda you want? - Shut up! What an acid stomach. I said shut up. Bitch! What? It's gonna blow, big time. I'll rip your spine out. He's just trying to scare you. Don't let him scare you! - In the face! - You, stay still. Punch him in the face! In the face! Pull his hair! He hates that! It's gonna blow. Don't move! You, the ticket! Now! The ticket! Who's the dwarf? See, Moltes? I told you to be courteous with the short guy. Make yourself useful. Private party, sirs. Francis? Give me that. Look out! Fight back! We're going back up. You've had your dinner, so now I want my tip. The ticket. Fuck off. Really? And now what? One... Two... How sweet. You like your blondie. Let him go or I off you! Shut your face. Don't move, honey. Martinet? Sorry. Wrong floor. Are you okay, darling? Don't look, it's horrible. I want you both to know... I'm sorry. It's my fault. It's okay. Let me look. Forgive me... You weren't hit. I felt the bullet. I'll hit you now! The cops! We've gotta go. Go that way. Take the ticket. - Why? - Take it. The cops are coming. I'm not going back to jail. Moltes, wait. Don't lose it. You're not gonna get me. Get out! I want him alive. What the fuck is this! Fucking triplets. So, you're Moltis. His name is Moltes. Strong. Extra-strong Moltis. Mr. All-France-Fears-Me. Listen here, Moltis. I'll work to make you cry, until you cry. And if you don't cry... you'll cry anyway. Got it? Yes. Yes who? Yes boss. This place is different. Here, it's scary. When men come here, they're men. When they leave, they're not men. They're like... women. Stay calm. Your toilet. Open the door. Open it right now! Open the door, bastard! Don't worry. Close the door. 6 months later... You're gonna suffer, Moltis. Moltis. Moltis. Moltis. I say Moltis. If I wanna say Moltis, I say Moltis. You're too much of a smarty ass. I'm gonna make you walk backwards through the desert behind a camel. He who laughs later will laugh at the end. It's from Italy. Who would write to you? You coming to bingo? What's the prize? Your watch. What's going on? Tell me what's happening! What's going on? You're a free man. I swore I wouldn't let you down. Friends of mine. I'll introduce you. They're mercenaries. I hired them.
