HAN: Loud and clear, kid. What's up? (STATIC) Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. HAN: There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. Sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. (BRAYING) LUKE: Steady! Hey! Steady, girl! Hey, what's the matter? You smell something? (GROWLING) - (GROANS) - (GROWLS) (SCREECHES) (BRAYING) (CLAMORING) (DROID BEEPING) (BEEPS) HAN: Chewie! Chewie! Chewie! (CHEWIE GRUNTS) All right! Don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. (CHEWIE GRUMBLES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around. RIEEKAN: Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system... it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships. General, I gotta leave. I can't stay anymore. RIEEKAN: I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a dead man. A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General. Well, Your Highness. Guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. LEIA: Han! HAN: Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you had decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into in Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! - We need? - Yes. - Well, what about you need? - I need. I don't know what you're talking about. (CLICKS TONGUE) You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know? HAN: Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes! You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader. No! That's not it! Come on. - Ah-ha! Come on! - You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was gonna leave without giving you a good-bye kiss? - I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee! - I can arrange that! HAN: You could use a good kiss! - C-3PO: Don't try to pay me. - (R2-D2 BEEPS) I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. (R2-D2 BEEPING) But it's suppose to be freezing. How will we dry out her clothes? - I really don't know. Oh, switch off! - (R2-D2 BEEPING CONTINUES) Why did you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here, and you pull both... - Excuse me, sir. - Put them back together right now! - Might I have a word with you, please? - What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the commun... I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her. Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. - I don't know where he is. - Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? - Well, uh, you see... - Deck Officer! - HAN: Deck Officer! - Excuse me, sir. - Might I... - MAN: Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. C-3PO: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? - Why not? - Impossible man. Come along, R2, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger. (BRAYING) Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in the south entrance. - He might have forgotten to check in. - Not likely. - Are the speeders ready? - Uh, not yet. We're having trouble adapting them to the cold. We'll have to go out on tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right, and my friend's out in it. (BRAYING) Your tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell! Hyah!

There's really nothing more we can do. - And my joints are freezing up. - (BEEPS, CHIRPING) Don't say things like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. And he'll be quite all right. You'll see. Stupid little short circuit. He'll be quite all right. (BEEPING) (PANTING) (GROANS) (WIND WHISTLING) (LUKE GROANS) (BRAYING) (BRAYING) (BRAYING CONTINUES) (BEEPS) Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no. MAN: Still no contact from Skywalker and Solo. C-3PO: Mistress Leia. R2 says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals. Although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. - Close the doors. - Yes, sir. (R2-D2 BEEPING) R2 says the chances of survival are 725 to 1. (DOOR WHIRRING) - (WHIMPERS) - (BEEPS) - (DOOR CLOSES) - (CHEWIE EXCLAIMS) Actually, R2 has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (CHIRPS) (BEEPING) Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know, for a human being. (CHEWIE WHIMPERS) (WIND WHISTLING) OBI-WAN: Luke. Luke. Ben? You will go to the Dagobah system. Dagobah system? There you will learn from Yoda... the Jedi master who instructed me. Ben! - Ben? - (BRAYING) HAN: Luke! Luke! (WIND WHISTLING) Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. (BRAYING CONTINUES) (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) HAN: Not much time. LUKE: (GROANING) Ben! Ben! - (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) - Ahh. Ahh. - Hang on, kid. - (LIGHTSABER HUMMING) Dagobah system. - Whew! - Dagobah. This may smell bad, kid... - Yoda. - (PANTING) but it'll keep you warm... till I get the shelter up. (LUKE GROANING) Ben! Dagobah! Ah! Ah! I thought they smelled bad... on the outside! Ahh! - (WIND WHISTLING) - Ahh. (HAN PANTING) (SNOWSPEEDER ROARING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Echo Base. I've got something. Not much. But, it could be a life-form. (ROARING CONTINUES) ROGUE 2: Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue 2. This is Rogue 2. Captain Solo! Do you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue 2. HAN: Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo Base, This is Rogue 2. I've found them. Repeat, I've found them. C-3PO: Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again. - (R2-D2 BEEPING) - LUKE: Thanks, 3PO. R2 expresses his relief also. - HAN: How you feeling, kid? - (CHEWIE GROWLS) You don't look so bad to me. You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark. Thanks to you. - That's two you owe me, junior. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) Well, Your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy field. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight. I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain. (CHEWIE LAUGHS) Laugh it up, Fussball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My... LEIA: Why, you stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder! Who's scruffy-looking? (R2-D2 WHISTLES, CHIRPS) I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Well, I guess you don't know everything about women yet. (CHEWIE GRUMBLES) Headquarters personnel, report to command center. (GROWLING) Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. - Excuse us, please. - (R2-D2 BEEPING) Princess, we have a visitor. Picked up something outside the base's Zone 12 moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures. Could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait. There's something very weak coming through. (RADIO STATIC) C-3PO: Sir, I'm fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38. (DROID BEEPING) (CHEWIE ROARS) (ALARM BLARES) (CHEWIE GRUNTS) - I'm afraid there's not much left. - What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. Must've had a self-destruct. An imperial probe droid. HAN: It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation. (DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING) (ION ENGINES ROARS) (DARTH VADER BREATHING) - MAN: Admiral? - Yes, Captain. I think we've got something, sir. PIETT: The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads. The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. - If we followed up every lead... - PIETT: But, sir. The Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of humans. - VADER: You found something? - Yes, my lord. (RADIO STATIC) That's it. The rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. - It could be smugglers... - That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare your men. Admiral? Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded... evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. HAN: All right! That's it. Try it. (SIZZLING) - Oh! Turn it off! Turn it off! - (CHEWIE EXCLAIMING) - (ALARM BLARING) - Turn it off! Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-47s. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. - Take care, sir. - Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, Okay? (CHEWIE GROWLS) (GRUNTS) Okay! Okay! - HAN: Hi, kid. - (BEEPING) There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. - Wait a second. - (BEEPING) - You all right? - Yeah. - Be careful. - You too. (CHEWIE GROWLS) General, there's a fleet of Stardestroyers coming out of hyperspace in Sector 4. Reroute all power to the energy shield. We gotta hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for gun assault. (ION ENGINES ROARING) What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moved out of light speed. ComScan has detected an energy field protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed too close to the system. - He... He felt surprise was wiser. - He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord. Lord Vader, The fleet has moved out of light speed, and we're preparing to... (GROANS, CHOKING) You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. - Captain Piett. - PIETT: Yes, my lord? Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field... and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off the system. - (GROANING) - You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader. LEIA: All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Stardestroyer? The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. - Understood? - ALL: Yeah. - Good luck. - Okay, Everybody to your stations. - Let's go! - Right. Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open shield. Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control. Fire! (ION CANNON FIRES) - MAN: (ON PA) The first transport is away. - (ALL CHEERING) The first transport is away. DAK: Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dak. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. (WEAPONS COCKING) (AT-AT WALKING) Echo Station Three-T-Eight. MAN: We've spotted imperial walkers. MAN 2: Imperial walkers on the north ridge. (BEEPS, WHISTLING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) LUKE: Echo Station 5-7, We're on our way. All right, boys. Keep tight now. DAK: Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dak! Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters! Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. LUKE: Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dak. Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. Just hang on! Hang on, Dak! Get ready to fire that tow cable. (SCREAMS) Dak! Dak! (SCREAMS) Yes, Lord Vader? I've reached the main power generators. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. - Rogue 3! - WEDGE: Copy, Rogue Leader. LUKE: Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. WEDGE: Coming around, Rogue Leader. Steady, Rogue 2. Activate harpoon! (HARPOON ACTIVATES) Good shot, Jansen! - One more pass. - JANSEN: Coming around, Wedge! Cable out. Let her go! Detach cable! Cable detached! Come on! (CRUMPLING EXPLOSIONS) - Hah! That got him! - I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. - Lauch patrol. - Evacuate remaining ground staff. (CHEWIE GROWLS) HAN: No, no, no! This one goes there! That one goes there, right? R2, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? (R2-D2 CHIRPING) And do take good care of yourself. (BEEPING) - (CHIRPING) - Oh, dear. Oh, dear. All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. - Rogue 2, are you all right? - ROGUE 2: Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader. Well, set harpoon. I'll cover for you. - Coming around. - Watch that crossfire, boys. Set for position 3. - Steady. - LUKE: Stay tight and low. - This is it! - (SCREAMING) Hobbie! I've been hit! (RUMBLING) (THUDS) (CLAMORING) - HAN: You all right? - Why are you still here? Heard the command center had been hit. You've got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm gonna get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in Sector 12 to the south slope to protect the fighters. - (LOUD BOOM) - (C-3PO SCREAMING) Imperial troops have entered the base. Imperial troops have entered...(STATIC) Come on. That's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get your transports! Whoa! Wait for me! (MEN SHOUTING) (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) (LIGHTSABER DEACTIVATES) (CRUMPLING EXPLOSIONS) (LOUD BOOM) - Distance to power generators? - 17.28. (EXPLODES) Target. Maximum firepower. - (LOUD BOOM) - (LEIA SCREAMING) Transport, this is Solo. Better take off. I can't get to you. I'll get her out on the Falcon. - Come on. - (LEIA GRUNTS) C-3PO: (STAMMERS) Where are you going? Come back! (LOUD BOOMING) (DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING) C-3PO: Hey, wait for me! Wait! Stop! - How typical. - HAN: Come on! (CHEWIE GROWLS) HAN: Hurry up, goldenrod! You're gonna be a permanent resident! C-3PO: Wait! Wait! (ENGINE STALLING) - (STEAM HISSES) - (CHEWIE GROANS) - How's this? - (CHEWIE GROWLS) Would it help if I got out and pushed? - Captain Solo! Captain Solo! - It might! (GROWLING) Sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. (ENGINE STARTS) This bucket of bolts is never gonna get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart. - Come on, come on! - (CHEWIE GROWLS) Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're gonna be wrong, and I just hope I'm there to see it. - Punch it! - (GRUNTS) - R2! - (WHISTLES, BEEPING) LUKE: Get her ready for takeoff. MAN: Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. (CHIRPING, BEEPING) Don't worry, R2. We're going. We're going. (R2-D2 BEEPS) LUKE: There's nothing wrong, R2. - I'm just setting a new course. - (WHISTLES, CHIRPS) We're not gonna regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. (WHISTLES, BEEPS) - LUKE: Yes, R2. - (R2-D2 BEEPING CONTINUES) That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while. (WHISTLES) (CHEWIE GROWLING) - I saw 'em! I saw 'em! - Saw what? HAN: Stardestroyers, two of 'em coming right at us. - Sir! Sir! May I suggest- - Shut him up or shut him down! - (CHEWIE ROARS) - Check the deflector shield. HAN: Great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Take evasive action! (ALARM SOUNDING) Prepare to make the jump to light speed. But, sir! - LEIA: They're getting closer. - (CHEWIE GRUNTS) Oh, yeah. Watch this. (ENGINE STALLING) Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir... I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. - It's impossible to go to lightspeed. - (GROWLS) We're in trouble! - Horizontal boosters! - (CHEWIE GROWLS) Alluvial dampers. - (ROARING) - HAN: Ow! That's not it! Bring me the hydrospanner! (ROARING CONTINUES) I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one. - (METAL CLANKING) - HAN: Oww! Chewie! - (LOUD THUDS) - (CHEWIE GROWLING) That wasn't a laser blast. Something hit us. Han, get up here! - Come on, Chewie! - (CHEWIE GRUNTS) LEIA: Asteroids! Oh, no. Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? LEIA: You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field - is approximately 3,720 to 1. - Never tell me the odds! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) - (CHEWIE GRUNTS) - (C-3PO YELPS) Look out! (SCREAMING) You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. - This could be it, sweetheart. - I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. - Ain't gonna argue with that. - Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. BOTH: Closer?! (GROWLS) (LASER FIRING) Oh, this is suicide! There's nowhere to go. There. That looks pretty good. - LEIA: What looks pretty good? - HAN: Yeah, that'll do nicely. C-3PO: Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? - I hope you know what you're doing. - Yeah, me too. - (WHISTLES) - Yep, that's it. Dagobah. (R2-D2 BEEPING) No, I'm not gonna change my mind about this. LUKE: I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. (SIGHS) There's something alive down there. (BEEPING) Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. (R2-D2 BEEPING) I know! I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing. Just hang on! I'm gonna start the landing cycle. (BEEPING CONTINUES) (R2-D2 CHIRPING) (BATS SQUAWKING) (CHIRPING CONTINUES) (WHISTLING) (BEEPING) (BEEPING CONTINUES) (CHIRPS, BEEPS) No, R2, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

(SCREAMING, BEEPING) (R2-D2 BEEPS) LUKE: Oh, no. Are you all right? Come on. (GRUNTING) You're lucky to get out of here. (GRUNTS) Anything broken? (BEEPS) If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. - (BEEPING) - R2, What are we doing here? It's like...(SIGHS) something out of a dream or... I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy. (BEEPS, LAUGHING) (DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING) - (SOFT THUD) - (STEAM HISSES) (VADER BREATHING) Yes, Admiral? PIETT: Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord, but it has entered an asteroid field, and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm gonna shut down everything but the emergency power systems. Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does that include shutting me down, too? No. I need you to talk to the Falcon. Find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. (CHEWIE GROWLS) Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. (CHEWIE GROWLS) C-3PO: Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job. (LOUD CRASHING) - Let go. - (SHUSHES) - Let go, please. - Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. I haven't got time for anything else. (DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES) (CHITTERING) (LUKE GRUNTING) - LUKE: Ready for some power? Okay. - (R2-D2 BEEPS) - Let's see now. - (BEEPS) Put that in there. - There you go. - (BEEPS) (SIGHS) Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda... if he even exists. - (BEEPING) - (GRUNTS, EXHALES) (SIGHS) It's really a strange place to find a Jedi master. (WHISTLES) - This place gives me the creeps. - (R2-D2 CHIRPS) But still... there's something familiar about this place. (WHISTLES, BEEPING) I don't know. - I feel like... - YODA: Feel like what? - (BEEPING) - (YODA YELLS) Like we're being watched! YODA: Away put your weapon! I mean you no harm! I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone you have, I would say, hmmm? - (LAUGHING) - Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm. I don't think so. - I'm looking for great warrior. - Oh! (LAUGHS) Great warrior. (LAUGHING) Wars not make one great. (GRUNTS) (PANTING) Aah! LUKE: Put that down! Now we... Hey! That's my dinner! - (R2-D2 BEEPING) - (YODA SPITING) How you get so big eating food of this kind? LUKE: Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle. And if we could get our ship out, we would. But we can't, so why... Cannot get your ship out. (GIGGLES) - Hey! Get out of there! - Ah! No! Oh! Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Aah! (LAUGHING) (BEEPING) (GROANING) You're making a mess. (SIGHS) Mmm. - (LAUGHS) - Hey, give me that! Mine, or I will help you not. I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole?! Slimy? My home this is... Whoa. Mmm! (GRUNTS) LUKE: R2, let him have it. - Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! - LUKE: R2! Now, will you move along, little fellow? We've got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you I will... find your friend. I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi master. Oh. Jedi Master? Yoda. You seek Yoda! - You know him? - Hmm. Take you to him I will. (LAUGHS) Yes, yes. But now... we must eat. Come. (LAUGHS) Good food. Come. (LAUGHING) YODA: Come! Come! - R2? - (BEEPS) Stay and watch after the camp. (R2-D2 BEEPING) C-3PO: Oh! Where is R2 when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. - I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. - (BEEPS) Well, of course I'll have to replace it. HAN: Here! And Chewie... (CHEWIE GRUNTS) I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. (CRACKLING) Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. (SIGHS) You make it so difficult sometimes. I do. I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally... maybe... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. - Stop that. - Stop what? Stop that. My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty too. What are you afraid of? - Afraid? - Your trembling. I'm not trembling. You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. - I'm a nice man. - No, your not. C-3PO: Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. HAN: Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) And that Lord Vader was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. VADER: No, Captain. They're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. PIETT: Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral? What is it? The emperor commands you to make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field... so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord. VADER: What is thy bidding, my master? EMPEROR: There is a great disturbance in the Force. VADER: I have felt it. We have a new enemy, the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy... is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker. How is that possible? Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. - He could destory us. - He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes! He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, master. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (R2-D2 WHIMPERS) (BEEPS, WHISTLES) (YODA CHUCKLES) Look, I'm sure is delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience! For the Jedi, it is time to eat as well. Eat! (LAUGHS) Eat! Hot! YODA: Good food! Mmm, good, hmm? How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Root leaf. (LAUGHS) I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm? Mostly because of my father, I guess. Ah, father. Powerful Jedi was he. (LAUGHS) Mmm. - Powerful Jedi. - LUKE: Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. I don't even know what I'm doing here! We're wasting our time! (BOTH SIGH) I cannot teach him. - The boy has no patience. - OBI-WAN: He will learn patience. Hmm. Much anger in him... like his father. OBI-WAN: Was I any different when you taught me? No. - He is not ready. - Yoda. I am ready! Ben, I can be a Jedi! Ben, tell him! I'm ready. Ready, are you? What know you ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. YODA: A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, hmm? The most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was, hmm? What he was doing. Hmm. Adventure. Ha. Excitement. Ha. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! OBI-WAN: So was I, if you remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. (SIGHS) Will he finish what he begins? I won't fail you. I'm not afraid. Ahh... You will be. You will be. (RUMBLING) (SQUEALS) (SCREAMING) Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, 3... Something out there. - Where? - Outside the cave. (THUDDING) There it is. Listen, listen. - I'm going out there. - Are you crazy? I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Oh, then I'm going with you. (CHEWIE ROARING) I think it might be better if I stay behind and guard the ship. Oh, no. - LEIA: This ground sure feels strange. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) Doesn't feel like rock. Huh. HAN: There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! - It's all right! It's all right! - (CHEWIE GRUMBLES) Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship and make sure there are no more attached, chewing on the power cables. Mynocks. Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. (LEIA SCREAMING) - Han! - (CHEWIE GROWLING) (SCREAMING) Go away! Go away! Beastly thing! Shoo! Shoo! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Wait a minute. - (BLASTER FIRES) - (LOUD RUMBLING) (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEWIE GROWLS) Let's get out of here! The Empire is still out there! I don't think... No time to discuss this in committee! (GROANS) I am not a committee! (CHEWIE GROWLS) You can't make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field. Sit down, sweetheart! We're taking off! - Look! - I see it! I see it! - C-3PO: We're doomed! - LEIA: The cave is collapsing. - This is no cave! - What? (GROWLING) (SQUAWKING) (SQUAWKING CONTINUES) YODA: Yes, run! Yes! A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. YODA: Anger, fear, aggression... The dark side of the Force are they, easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. - Is the dark side stronger? - No. No. No. Quicker, easier, more seductive. How do I know the good side from the bad? You will know when you are calm, at peace, passive. Hmm, A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. - But tell me why I can't... - No, no. There is no why. - (SIGHS) - Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. (R2-D2 BEEPING SOFTLY) There's something not right. I feel cold... - LUKE: death. - That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. Your weapons, you will not need them. (SQUISHES) (R2-D2 BEEPING) (CHIRPING, BEEPING) (SQUAWKING) (SCREECHES) (FOOTSTEPS) (VADER BREATHING) (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) (LIGHTSABER CRACKLES) (R2-D2 BEEPS SOFTLY) Hmm. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) PIETT: Bounty hunters. - We don't need their scum. - Yes, sir. Those rebels won't escape us. (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) Sir, we have a priority signal from the Stardestroyer A venger. Right. VADER: There will be a substantial reward for the... one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. - BOBA: As you wish. - PIETT: Lord Vader. My lord, we have them. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) C-3PO: Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. HAN: Let's get out of here. Ready for lightspeed? One, two... - three! - (ENGINE STALLS) (CHEWIE GROWLS SOFTLY) - It's not fair. - (CHEWIE ROARING) HAN: Transfer circuits aren't working. It's not my fault! - No lightspeed? - It's not my fault. C-3PO: Sir, we've just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. - Turn her around! I said turn her around! - (CHEWIE GROWLS LOUDLY) I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them? Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an imperial... - Shut up! - (CHEWIE GROWLS) NEEDA: We're moving to attack position. Shields up. Track them. They may come around for another pass. MAN: Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them... and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa. YODA: Use the force. Yes. (WHISTLES, BEEPING) Now, the stone... Feel it. (CHIRPING, BEEPING) - Concentrate! - (GRUNTS) (R2-D2 BEEPING) (YODA GROANS) (R2-D2 WHISTLING) (BEEPING CONTINUES) LUKE: Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. (SIGHS) Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different. Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. - All right, I give it a try. - No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. (SIGHS) (WATER SLOSHING) (R2-D2 BEEPING) (R2-D2 WHIMPERS) (R2-D2 MOANS SOFTLY) (SIGHS) I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not, for my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life create it... makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us... and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you... Here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere! Yes! Even between the land... and the ship. LUKE: You want the impossible. (R2-D2 BEEPING) (WHISTLES) (WATER RUNNING) (BEEPING) Hmm. (R2-D2 BEEPS) (WHISTLES) I don't... I don't believe it. That is why you fail. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (CHOKING) (VADER BREATHING) VADER: Apology accepted, Captain Needa. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light speed it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now. Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination... along their last known trajectory. Yes, my lord. We'll find them. Don't fail me again... Admiral. Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) C-3PO: Captain Solo, this time you've gone too far. (CHEWIE ROARS) No! I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? - The fleet's beginning to break up. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. (CHEWIE MURMURS) I really don't see how that's going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough. HAN: Thank you. Which every mind for your next move? If they follow standard imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light speed, and then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we got to find a safe port somewhere around here. - Any ideas? - And where are we? The Anoat system. The Anoat system. There's not much there. No. Whoa, wait. This is intresting. Lando. Lando system. Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a cardplayer, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him? - Thanks. - Bespin is pretty far. But I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. - Do you trust him? - No! But he's got no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. - (DULL HUMMING) - Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many of them. But you do have them. (THRUSTERS FIRING) (R2-D2 BEEPING) YODA: Concentrate. Feel the force flow. Yes. (BEEPS, WHISTLES) YODA: Good. Calm. Yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future. The past. Old friends long gone. Han? Leia! - (R2-D2 SCREAMING) - (LUKE GROANS) Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control! (R2-D2 BEEPING) I saw... I saw a city in the clouds. Hmm, Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But... you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain! MAN: You will not deviate from your present course. C-3PO: Rather touchy, aren't they? - I thought you knew this person. - (CHEWIE EXCLAIMING) That was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform 3-2-7. Thank you! Nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried? C-3PO: Oh. No on to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything gonna be fine. Trust me. (DOOR HISSES) (CHEWIE GROWLS) See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, huh? (GROWLS) HAN: Hey! LANDO: Why, you slimy double-crossing, no-good swindler. You gotta a lot guts coming here... after what you pulled. (GROWLS) (LANDO LAUGHING) How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! - (GROWLS) - Well, he seems very friendly. - (LAUGHING CONTINUES) - Yes. Very friendly. - LANDO: What are you doing in here? - Ah, repairs. I thought you could help me out. - What have you done to my ship? - Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. And how you doin', Chewbacca? You still hanging around with this loser? (CHEWIE GROWLS) Hello, what have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. And who might you be? - Leia. - LANDO: Welcome, Leia. (CHUCKLES) All right, all right. You old smoothie. Hello, sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... - (GROWLS) - Well, really! - What's wrong with the falcon? - Hyperdrive. - I'll get my people to work on her. - Good. That ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. HAN: How's the gas mine? Still paying off for you? LANDO: Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. - I've had labor difficulties. - (LAUGHING) LANDO: What's so funny? You. Listen to you. You sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you brings back a few things. - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm responsible these days. LANDO: It's the price you pay for being successful. Ooh. Nice to see a familiar face. - (SPEAKS ALIEN DIALECT) - How rude! (BEEPING) That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder it. Hello. (BEEPING CONTINUES) How interesting. MAN: Who are you? Oh, my! I... I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. No, please don't get up. No! (CHEWIE MURMURS SOFTLY) Luke, you must complete the training. Ah, I can't keepthe vision out of my head. They're my friends. I got to help them. You must not go. But Han and Leia will die if I don't. OBI-WAN: You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them. - LUKE: I feel the force. - But you cannot control it. OBI-WAN: This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes! Yes! To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave. But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and to finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the emperor wants. That is why your friends are made to suffer. That's why I have to go. OBI-WAN: Luke, I don't want to lose you to the emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi knight, with the Force as his ally, will conquire Vader... And his emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did... you will become an agent of evil. Patience! And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for... yes. If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. - LUKE: R2? - (R2-D2 BEEPS) Fire up the converters. Luke! OBI-WAN: Don't give in to hate. That leads to the dark side. Strong as Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. (SIGHS) Told you I did. Reckless is he. Now... matters are worse. OBI-WAN: That boy's our last hope. YODA: No. There is another. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) The ship's almost finished. Two or three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. HAN: Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. LEIA: I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him either. He is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. Then you're as good as gone, aren't you? (CHEWIE GROWLS) (GROWLS) (GROWLS) (HOWLING) (ROARING) (GROWLS) - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - LEIA: What happened? Where? - Found him in the junk pile? - (GROWLS) Oh, what a mess. Chewie, you think you can repair him? Lando's got people that can fix him. - No thanks. - (TERMINAL BEEPS) (CHEWIE GROWLS) I'm sorry, am I interrupting anything? Hmm, not really. (SIGHS) You look absolutely beautiful. LANDO: You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Would you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with your droid? No. No problem. Why? LANDO: So, you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the Mining Guild, then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed. Which is advantageous for everybody, since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. HAN: Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation, shut you down? It's always been a danger that looms like a shadow over everything we've built. But things have developed that'll ensure security. LANDO: I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. (DOOR OPENS) (VADER BREATHING) (CHEWIE GROWLS) VADER: We would be honored... If you would join us. (CHEWIE GROWLS) I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. (CHEWIE GROWLING) (R2-D2 BEEPING) No, 3PO's with them. (BEEPING CONTINUES) Just hang on. We're almost there. - (WHISTLE SCREECHING) - (ROARING, GROWLING) (GROWLING CONTINUES) (GROWLS SOFTLY) Oh ah ooh ah. I m trbly srry. I dndt mn to intrddd. No! Secret? Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger! I must tell the others. Oh, no! I been shot! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt... after I have Skywalker. BOBA FETT: He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly? - No. - Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal is getting worse all the time. C-3PO: Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Oh, oh, oh, that's much better. Wait! Wait! Oh, my! What have you done? I'm backwards, you flea-bitten furball! Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... (CHEWIE GROWLS) - I feel terrible. - (GROWLS) (GROWLS) Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - Lando. - HAN: Get out of here, Lando. - Shut up and listen! Vader's agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's given him to the bounty hunter. Vader wants us all... He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker. - Luke? - LANDO: Lord Vader set a trap for him. - And we're the bait! - Yeah. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all real good, didn't you? - My friend. - (GROANS) - (HAN GROANS) - Stop! (GROWLS) I done all I can. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I've got my own problems. Yeah. You're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people. (HAN GROANING) VADER: This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker... for his journey to the emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching, X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader? We only use this facility for carbon freezing. You put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the emperor's prize damaged. It will tested... on Captain Solo. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING) C-3PO: If only you'd attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility for me, so don't do anything foolish. (VADER BREATHING) What's going on, buddy? You're being put into carbon-freeze. BOBA: What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! (CHEWIE HOWLS) C-3PO: No! No, no! Stop! HAN: Stop, Chewie! Stop! - (SCREAMING) - Get it all killed to me! C-3PO: Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die! Hey! Hey! Listen to me! Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me! - Hey, save your strength. - (CHEWIE YELPS) HAN: There will be another time. The princess. You have to take care of her. You hear me? Huh? (CHEWIE GROANS) - I love you. - I know. (CHEWIE HOWLING) (GROWLING) (HOWLING CONTINUES) What's going on? Turn around! Chewbacca, I can't see. (DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING) (CHEWIE GROWLING) (THUDS) Oh, they've encased him in carbonite. C-3PO: He should be quite well-protected, if he survived the freezing process, that is. VADER: Well, Calrissian. Did he survive? Yes, He's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours, Bounty Hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, lord. VADER: Good. See to it that he finds his way in here. VADER: Calrissian. Take the princess and the Wookie to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further. (GROWLS) (R2-D2 BEEPING) (BLASTER FIRES) (R2-D2 BEEPS) (BEEPING CONTINUES) (BEEPING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEWIE GROWLS) Luke! Luke! Don't! It's a trap! (SCREAMING) It's a trap! (SIZZLING) (WHISTLES, BEEPING) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSING) (VADER BREATHING) VADER: The Force is with you, Young Skywalker. But your not a Jedi yet.

Hold them in the secruity tower... and keep it quiet. Move. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) LEIA: What do you think you're doing? I'm getting out of here. I knew all along. It had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han, we're going to trust you? - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - (CHOKING) I have no choice! What are you doing? Trust him! Trust him! We understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help! We don't need any of your help. (CHOKING) Han! (GROWLS) (CHOKING CONTINUES) - LEIA: What? - Han! It sounds like Han. (CHOKING) There's still a chance to save Han... (GROWLS) at the east... - platform! - (ROARS) - Chewie. - (GROWLS) C-3PO: I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee. BOBA: Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. (R2-D2 BEEPING) C-3PO: R2, R2! Where have you been? - Wait! Turn around you woodly. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) Hurry, hurry. We're trying to save Han from the Bounty Hunter. (BEEPING) Well, at least your still in one peace. - Look what happen to me? - (R2-D2 BEEPING) (CHEWIE GROWLS) C-3PO: Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you! (CHEWIE GRUNTING) (WHISTLES, BEEPS) (LIGHTSABER CRACKLES) You have learned much, young one. LUKE: You'll find, I'm full of surprises. (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) Whoa! (GRUNTS) Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew is to be true. No. (LUKE YELLING) All too easy. Perhaps your not as strong as the emperor thought. VADER: Impressive. Most impressive. (ALARM BLARING) (SCREAMING) (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear. (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) Now, release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me. (CRACKLING CONTINUES) (VADER SCREAMS) (LIGHTSABER DEACTIVATING) (VADER BREATHING) (LIGHTSABERS ACTIVATING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTS) (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) (GRUNTS) - (LUKE SCREAMS) - (WIND WHISTLING) (WIND WHISTLING CONTINUES) (CHEWIE ROARS) LANDO: Secruity code has been changed. R2, you can tell the computer to override the security systems. C-3PO: R2, hurry. (BEEPS) Attention, this is Lando Calrissian. LANDO: (ON PA) Attention. The Empire has taken control of the city. I advise everyone to leave... before more imperial troops arrive. (R2-D2 BEEPING) - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - (R2-D2 BEEPING) This way. C-3PO: Well, don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (WHISTLES, BEEPING) (BEEPING CONTINUES) (BEEPING CONTINUES) (SCREAMS) We're not interested... in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon, it's fixed! (BEEPS) Just open the door you stupid lump! (R2-D2 BEEPING) C-3PO: I never doubt you for a second. Wonderful! (R2-D2 BEEPS) (SCREAMING) That hurts! Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow! (CHEWIE GROWLS SOFTLY) Leia! Go! (GRUNTS) I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course I've looked better. (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) VADER: You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself to destroy... as Obi-Wan did. (CRACKLING CONTINUES) - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS) (YELLING) (SCREAMING, GROANS) There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. Luke. You do not yet realize your importance. You've only become to discover your power. Join me, and I will complete your training. With our combined strength... we can end this destructive conflict... and bring order to the galaxy. I'll never join you! If you only new the power... of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you... what happened to your father. He told me enough! - He told me you kill him! - No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! Luke, you can destroy the emperor. He has forseen this. VADER: It is your destiny. Join me, and together... we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It is the only way. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) (YELLS) (SCREAMS) (WIND WHISTLING) (GRUNTS) Ben? Ben, please. (GROANS) Ben. Leia. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYS) Hear me. - Leia. - (SOFTLY) Luke. We've got to go back. - What? - I know where Luke is. What about those fighters? Chewie, just do it. What about Vader? All right, all right, all right! (THRUSTERS FIRING) Alert my stardestroyer... to prepare for my arrival. - Look, someone's up there. - (GROWLS) LEIA: It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down. We'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. (TERMINAL BEEPING) (CHEWIE GROWLS) LEIA: Okay. Easy, Chewie. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR OPENING) (ION ENGINES ROARING) - Lando? - LANDO: Okay, let's go. (SIGHS) Leia. LANDO: All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back. LEIA: Stardestroyer. LANDO: All right, Chewie. Ready for lightspeed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. - Punch it! - (GROWLS) (ENGINE STALLING) (CHEWIE EXCLAIMS) They told me they fixed it. I trusted them! Let me fix it! It's not my fault! (GRUNTS) PIETT: They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive... on the Millennium Falcon? - Yes, my lord. - Good. Prepare the boarding party... and set your weapons for "stun." - Yes, my lord. Lieutenant. - Yes, sir. Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light speed? - (R2-D2 BEEPING) - We can't. How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? (BEEPING CONTINUES) The city's central computer told you? R2-D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what your doing! - Luke. - Father. Son, come with me. Ben. Why didn't you tell me? - Chewie! - (CHEWIE GROWLS) It's Vader. Luke. It is your destiny. (SIGHS) Ben. Why didn't you tell me? Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. - (R2-D2 BEEPING) - (CHEWIE GROWLS) C-3PO: R2, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet. You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! (BEEPING) - (R2-D2 SCREAMING) - C-3PO: You did it! (THRUSTERS FIRING) (VADER BREATHING) (ENGINES ROARING) Luke, we're ready for takeoff. - (GROWLS) - LUKE: Good luck, Lando.
