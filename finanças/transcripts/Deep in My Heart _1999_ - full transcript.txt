DEEP IN MY HEART First of all: I'm not Irish. it's not another one of those stereotypes: Boston Irish Catholic bigot living in the projects. well that we did.. we did live in the projects. My husband Bob was making $70 a week and half of that was going to support the children of his first marriage. Yeah, he was divorced and he was 15 years older than me. He was my school bus driver when I went to high school. He asked for a bite of my Milky Way That was the start of our courtship You can bet my family wasn't delighted to see me marry him but he was a good man, good husband, good father, good person. So, there we were, living on $35 a week with our two girls but remember this was 1961 $35 went a lot farther than it does now Our Jack was in the White House looked as if our country had turned a corner not really political, but I believed that and our Pope, that was Pope John the 23rd at that time said we all had to learn to live together and I believe that too. And Bob believed that and he was Irish. When you get right down to it I'm partially Irish too. Mostly French, but I'm partially Irish. Afterwards, they asked what was a woman doing out on the streets after midnight? They sure let me know they believed there was another man. Well, there was another man. His name was Elvis. Elvis Presley. And he had a brand new movie out and I had a brand new four month old baby. I was still breastfeeding. It was my first time out. Ok, sure. Milky Way Aramis what would you take? Elvis, he drives me wild. ... See you next week. Yeah, bye Bye So would you like to do the hula-hula? Gerry... I was raped.. a colored... Oh, God! Daddy, mommy throw up in the bathroom.. You're not hungry, are you? I'm pregnant. Might be mine? What if it isn't? Might be? We don't have much choice. We have to wait and see. Oh, Bob.. Baby, I'll still behalf you. You didn't consider bringing it home? That's what you want? I wanted to be our baby I hate to think that inside me is growing... It's a baby, Gerry, that's all it is. Louis you stay away from that.. John get out of the mud! The black is a nigger now You smell like one too, I bet! ... What do they got the protest about, that's what I want to know! Now it is Mississippi. If you stay in Roxbury no one's gonna get you any trouble. I don't wanna stay.. like that Sammy Davis jr. You imagine that Swedish girl having his baby I'm a so-called insider taking your father That's just a baby, that's all it is. You haven't seen a doctor at all for this pregnancy? I have two children already, I know how it's done. I've been nervous. This might not be my husband's baby. oh? I was raped by a negro. Now that changes things quite a bit. We'll know right away, won't we? Not likely, it will be to be hard to tell the race of a newborn especially in... I'll send the social worker in to see you. You started plans to get the baby up? No, we haven't decided. I mean, if it turns out to be colored. We haven't decided. And how are you gonna feel every time someone asks you about the father of this child? I..I don't know. I'll send the social worker in. This would be a lot easier if you don't get attached. Doctor! I tried not to. Believe me, I tried not to. In the beginning I prayed to God that one of us would die. But eight months is too long to close your heart against the... yourself living right inside you It's too late to say don't get attached now. Your brother John says she's a beautiful child. Have you seen her yourself? Have I seen her? I gave her my Milky Way, a first Milky way she's a Cummings, she really enjoyed it. I'm just giving the official word going home I like the name you pick for her, too. Barbra Ann it's good name, Barbra Ann Cummings Suits her. You see her knuckles? Our babies come out purpose plums Bob, the doctor says she's gonna stay that way. I think that she should be with people who look like her. I don't want anyone ever to be cruel to her Okay. I told your mother we'd be coming home without the baby I asked her to tell the others you were too upset to ever hear mentioned again They'll think she's dead. I suppose that's the best way to think about it. Are you ready? Yes, Father. What name have you chosen for this child? Barbara Ann. Barbara Ann, I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. You see the light of Christ. Mrs. Birrell? Yes Her name's Barbara Ann. I made it. When she's adopted, will they let her take it with her? Probably, I don't have clothes to spare. Can I call? I'm pretty sure social services told you the rules. I suppose you are used to this, but would you not... She'll be fine. She'll be fine here. I have no lack of hair, no bracelet, no pictures none of the things you get even when your baby dies. So it's hard for me to remember. Guess I wasn't supposed to remember but I did... every single day You're sure you want to do this? Yeah You're shaking? I gotta get over that now, don't I? Can't be blamed every colored man for what one did. SEGREGATION NOW! ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL WE NEED BETTER SCHOOLS She's over 2 now. 2 and 3/4. Almost 3. You think we can provide the answer? She is in foster care, she must have been adopted away a long time ago. Maybe they know where she is? Gerry, Barbra is gone, let her be. KEEP OUR COUNTRY PURE "We shall overcome" WE DEMAND FREEDOM NOW! Married people have secrets. Bob and I had one. Its name was Barbara We shared it for 24 years. We didn't talk about it much. After a while when Martin Luther King was murdered we figured what was the point: we were the enemy, we killed him. I didn't think Barbara would ever want to know us. Ghetto? Well, you say ghetto to some people and they think... well..I don't have to tell you what you're thinking, do I? But it wasn't like that when you lived inside. We had our doctors and lawyers, churches.. businesses, we had community, a good place to raise up children. and that's just what I made it my business to do: first moan and then the abandoned ones. I raised them up decent, God-fearing and wanted. Then the war came in. Roger, Stevie, get away from the window! Close the curtain! Bob, you're okay? But you're holding onto Scotty so tightly that you gonna cut off his circulation! Mom, I'm scared! Stevie! Stevie, come over here! Scotty, I want you to sit right over there. Good! Now you come on, Barbara Anne Ellie you stay right here I want you to hold Tracy Then I'll hold on to you. You see, we have nothing to be scared of, we're all here together. What's going on outside of our window everyone else needs a TV to see. I want it to stop! Sometimes you have to mark great trouble with great outcry. He's dead. I never even saw him! I think dr. King has found a far better home than he had here. I don't think there's any better home than this, mom. You're right. You are right, we are very blessed. Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart I will pray. Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart I will wait. Don't push it in shoving! There him again, mummy! Yeah, I think they're gonna take Larry Why can't we keep him? Come on! We gave him a home when he had need of it. If he doesn't need it anymore they'll be others that will! Now come on let's try out this birthday bike. How about a race? All right.Yeah? On your mark! Get ready, set, go! All right, that's fine enough, come back! Come back now! Shall I fix the seat for you? He didn't have to, he said my legs are just as long as his. Oh well, you certainly do have long legs! Has my daddy had long legs? I'm sure he did. But you don't know. No ma'am, I don't. What about Stevie's daddy and Roger's? Well, I was married to him, of course I know what kind of legs he had! why am I Cummings and you all are Burrels Barbara, who's been talking to you? This boy at my school. He said you couldn't be my mama cuz you and me don't have the same name. You and I. Are you my mommy? Yes I'm your mommy. I have been your whole life. You didn't come out of my body and you don't have my last name but I'm still your mommy and you're still my baby. Am I gonna be here forever? oh well, you'll grow up, you'll get married I believe you'll want a home of your own. No, I won't. I want to stay here with you. Well, as far as I'm concerned you can stay here as long as you like Good. Do you know what my name is? I suppose you've changed it. The last time. You promise? Yeah Okay, let me hear. Barbara Ann Cummings Sally Ali Suzie Doozy light bulb traffic. Well, that's a fine name, baby And I'm not a baby anymore. Today I'm seven. Well that's seven precious years you've been mine. Oh mrs. Burrell? Yes I'm mrs. Mazdan from social services. Oh, come on in! I hope you're not bringing me another baby! I have three of them. Well actually I have great news! We found a home for Barbara. Barbara? Yes uh..Barbara Ann Cummings. Well she's been here a long time! Barbara's awful old, you know! I know she's almost 8 but we were so fortunate in finding a family that specifically requested a female unadoptable. There's nothing unadoptable about it. You just forgot about as all you did. I'm afraid I have to agree. The previous worker left this case in a total shambles. Now when does the little one get back from school? About 4:00. I have in that... program? the buses are clear out to concord Her teachers recommended it, she's very bright you know I send along with my son Stevie I don't distinguish between Barbara and my own children. Well that's why you're one of our favorite homes. Of course we do pay you to take care of her. Between the babies Scotty and Tracy they more than eat that up Look, miss Marsden.. I'll give it up her share, whatever, just please don't take her from me. Corinne, we're trying to get this child out of Roxbury! Roxbury is what she knows. Oh she could know... Ah, this must be Barbara now. Hi mom! Hi baby. You know, you look just like your picture. You have a picture of me? well not with me but I do have another picture, it's of a family who would very much like you to come and see them Everyone else comes These people will come to my house? They live in Wisconsin. That's clear across the country! Now, this is the family. Would you like to take a look at them? No ma'am Oh Corrine has so many children and these people have none Why don't you get one of those babies, we have plenty of them! I don't believe you! They are white, You're gonna take her away from me and send a thousand miles away to white falks! Corinne, you're making this far more upsetting than it needs to be! What if I adopt her? What about that? You're a divorced woman on a limited income which comes, I might add, entirely from us. I love her, doesn't that mean anything? They would love her too, but I can see that you are too distressed to discuss this rationally. I'll be picking up Barbara on Thursday. Please make sure that she's ready. Thursday? That's right. Hello, Corinne. What did she say? Well she says to me you already have two children so why would you want another and I told the truth, to keep Barbara in the family She says that wasn't a good enough reason so I asked her, what would be a good enough reason? She tells me, somebody who would be willing to make a home for this child and as far as I can see Barbara already has a good home I was trying to make sure she could keep it. She jumped on that one like a shock "So you admit it, she would be staying with miss Morelli, not in your home!" I'm sorry Corinne, I did try I know you did I know you did. What if I run away? What if I don't go? I don't want to go. I don't want you to go either This is just an end of a part of the story but you have a whole new fright beginning starting. I want to be sure that I packed everything that you want to take. I want you, mamma. I want you, too. Where's Barbara Ann? I hope she's packed. You know what mr. Cummings said to me that morning they brought her here? He said "I suppose you're used to this, we're not" I'm sorry I was so cold. She's grieving. She wouldn't even go to the goodbye party they gave her at school She's a child, she'll adjust. You get snatched away from your mama when you were seven and a half, miss Marsden? That's irrelevant. Any colored woman marched up to your house, grabbed you up and sent you off with some colored family in Memphis? Milwaukee isn't Boston. And you seem to forget that this child is half white. Half doesn't count in this world! In the eyes of you people that is just one more little colored girl! Why don't you just let her be? Because it's my job to get her on a plane to Milwaukee and that's what I intend to do! I want you to take this with you. I think maybe we ought to leave that here. I just wanted to have something to remember us by. It's not a good idea. It will make her more comfortable if she takes it No, no just give it to me, dear just give it to me... Don't do that! Let her go! Not like this! LET HER GO! Who are you? Barbara Ann Cummings Sally Ally Susie Dusie light ball traffic And I love everything you are. They killed Barbara the day they took her from me. they killed her and I mourned her just like she died Later, social services called me and said "Barbara had got to where she was going and she was happy " well... she left here but I really think she never got anywhere else I was Barbara's mother that's how I saw her. Adopted child, adopted mother black...white. I didn't think it should make any difference. My husband and I have already decided this wasn't the world we wanted to bring a baby into but I thought that maybe we could make a home for a child who was already here a child who slipped through the cracks I guess I was wrong but at least we tried ...so we had to stand all the way to Brooklyn for this? You don't like it? Whatever we give her it's gonna be better than what she had. This girl spent more time in foster care than I did in grand school. I just hope we're not getting in over our heads oh I've organized that skid row protested at the missile sites than gas, fog ...trampled, okay. So one of us is a tough rod And I want her so much! Yeah but if you have a coronary that just leaves me. Why are you excited? I don't know okay, I'll acknowledge a slight tingle, the one in the car must be frost Here she is! It's that her? Paul, it's that her? Yeah, it can be! Give me the doll! Hi Brett Hi Barbara, I'm Annalise. Thank you. I'm so happy that you came to live with us. I brought you this. And this is Paul Barbra Ann.. You... you want to come with me and get your suitcase? We're going home now It's gonna be your home forever. you'll see..is gonna be fine it didn't go so bad she seemed to like your presence Paul, do you think it's gonna be okay? She seemed happy enough to me. she didn't complain that's different It is? How can you tell? Just know. Must be girl stuff. ...we ask for a boy No, not at all. A girl should be easier to handle. Handle, is that what you think we have to do? Don't be naive Ann! They told us the older the child the more the damage! You have no idea where that girl's been. You can go out, Barbra and play. That's okay. I like it inside. You have any homework? Already done Still like your school okay? oh yeah, that's great. You know, you can invite your friends from school over here anytime you want. okay. Did anyone ever tell you about your mother? before me I mean. Corinne? No, before Corinne She was white. That's why they thought you'd be okay here You can play with anyone, you're half white. Which half? I think we should move. I think we should move across town. What for? I like it here it's close to work I can walk to the lab. You're the one who said the schools are the best in the city! Barbara should occasionally see people who look like her besides the garbage man. it's true! she's a kid! We're gonna change our whole lives because of an eight-year-old? she's... After that I got to move all the way over to the other side of town become a commuter She doesn't have a single friend, she's unhappy yeah, well you know, I'm not so happy myself. I thought we had an arrangement. I'm gonna build buildings you're gonna build the Great Society, live our own lives. I believe in what you do, Ann I work as hard as I do so that you can do whatever it is you want to do this it's leaking taking over it's taking over everything She's your daughter, you adopted her you gave her your name yeah Okay Is this white house with the truck in front. You want to get out and play? Just about time. You're not staying are you? No. I asked you to make a choice and you did. We made a commitment to her. I don't see where I had an option yeah, well, I guess I do. I did some figuring, I can cover ome of the expenses here, but not all. Welcome to the real world. What's an Oreo, daddy? It's a cookie. it's chocolate on the outside and vanilla cream inside Goodbye Barbra Ann. Daddy's left Barb... but we're gonna be okay we're gonna be fine This had nothing to do with you It's real important to me that you understand that Do you understand that, Barbra? I'm gonna get a job and I think I'm gonna have to go to business school in the evening. I will learn how to do what I do and still support us I won't be able to be with you so much but now you're making friends you won't even miss me. okay Barb, I go to class. Dinner's in the oven. ok.

If you need anything. okay You can come and give me a kiss good night I glue my nails?/ Don't forget to turn the lights down! okay. I love you Barb Me too. Maybe this weekend we can do something fun Have a cook out or something. Ok. Barbra! I'm leaving now. See you in the morning. Don't let anyone in. Don't go to bed too late you need your rest. okay Hi, Barb, is Mom.I hope to get you. Have a good day. Barb, where the hell are you? Oh Barbara are you okay? Hi, mom. Who is that man? What man? A man jumped on your window That's my boyfriend, Dan. I don't want him in this house. not if I'm not here okay Barbara, I have been sitting in a hotel room, going out of my mind You should have called me. okay I'm trying to talk to you, don't just say okay. Yes ma'am. You're calling ma'am your mother? Curren used to say that. Yes ma'am, you can go outside to play now. I just remembered that. I'm starting to remember a lot. What you have got? You don't have to worry about Don I'm coming back. this is Annalise yo Genson Barbra's mother She didn't come home last night and I was wondering if she's at school. I didn't want to cause any trouble, I just wondered if she's there. No, I sent her home. I'm sorry to be the one to tell her, but she refuses to. She is pregnant, four months pregnant. I thought you want to know. thank you Barbra.. what are we going to do I'm moving in with Don sister could we discuss this? Discuss what?Giving it away? What about the baby? Have you considered what's best for the baby? Never stop considering that. I love my daughter. I know she didn't believe that. I loved her very much. I would have done anything... anything to make her happy until very near the end I thought we were doing fine. Not perfect. I'd stopped expecting perfection a long time ago what I don't know is that I stopped too late or too soon. "Still waters run deep" that's what Don says. Sometimes I feel like inside meets an ocean full of those words I never could speak. So, I've got to speak them now Even if that means backing up a little. That day she first dropped me off I did run out onto that street full of hope and excitement. Then white kids called me nigger I'd never heard that before. See, in the suburbs I'd been a novelty. I had no friends but people were polite to me. And now I was just one more black kid except to the black kids. They'd seen Anneliese They called me Oreo, they ran away from me. From the time I was seven until I was sixteen I didn't have a single playmate. a single person to talk to you. Very nice everyone, okay let's take time. Hold on! You want to sing? I sit behind your math class, Don Williams. Yeah. Hi, Don. Do you like us? Yeah. Stick around if you want. No, it's okay. No, stick around, I'll walk you home when we'll finish. there's one thing I can't stand it's a Gabby woman Those magazines girls they always say ask the man about himself How do you know that? To start, I got a bunch of sisters. You got a bunch of girlfriends too, I bet. I've had a few. So why did you yell to me in church? hey, I did't yell in church. I don't think that's gonna look too good on my record. You spoke loudly. That's because you never speak at all. All of mystery What do you want me to say? well.. the answer to that problem we got for homework. That would be a big help. Notice you get pretty good grades by yourself. You noticed me? Yeah What did you notice? People like you. Do you? Yeah. Why? Big football star singing in church. One I do for my father, the other for my mother. Guess which. You wanna get an icecream? What do you do for you? ... hey you're gonna come watch the football game tonight? you're cold? No. yeah, you are. I can see the goosebumps. Why do you always do that? Do what? All right. I see you're not gonna make this easy for me. Your leather jacket. yeah, you're gonna wear it. That's why we came well, partly. Probably because I want you to see this place I usually come here by myself Sat up here I feel like I could see my dreams just sitting out there waiting for me to reach it. You got dreams, Barbra? Have anything to do with me? Yeah. Till I met you I didn't believe there was any reason to dream. The dreams were just little kid things. I'm a little kid since I was seven and a half. You could be a little kid to me. Yeah, I know. You know what flashed into my mind that minute I saw you that day? when you were singing in the church just like my mom in Boston used to? think I look kind of cute if I didn't have those glasses on. No. Finally I'm gonna get home. She's not here, she didn't come. They're my family now. We got ours. what's that sound like? Waterball! You sure you can handle another boy? Sure. Listen, basically you're just fine. But I can't breathe. there's no question that you've got a touch of asthma. You ever had that before? No. well how about your family? He have got asthma? No, I mean your parents, you know your brothers and sisters I don't know, I was adopted well you might want to think about getting your medical records might be a good idea. How can I do that? Just write to the agency who placed you. Look, about the asthma I don't want to medicate you... I found a certificate in a drawer from second grade, spelling as something Ugly as sin! But she was so proud of it so I kept it. I don't know why. I kept lots of things that had to do with Barbara. even with my own kids I sometimes didn't do that I guess I figured she needed somebody keeping hold of the old days for her. figured some day she turned and looked this way You know how I call him? a lazy looking laying down peculiar kind of creation Try one more time. let me see careful yes sir Now you can go and play He just look like Scotty. That's Scotty's son. I don't know you, miss. Barbra Ann? Well, I guess you never heard of a fella who created the telephone! Look at you!

Do you remember that time but I hurt my knee and you came running to kiss and make it better. my little Florence Nightingale.. so cute You didn't get it fixed? Well, it wasn't mine to fix. I saved it for you. You take it, make it whole again. What's the matter, Barbra? You don't think that I wanted them to take you away, do you? No. Good! But you know that's how kids are today they just think grown-ups can move mountains but you know sometimes you just have to take your mountain and stand on it you'll see with two boys and one on the way stand up But you know, you carry it low. I believe it's gonna be a girl this time A girl... yeah My doctor asked me if I had asthma I couldn't tell him I don't know if I've had measles I don't know if there's cancer in my family I don't know anything. Well, I can tell you one thing: you are more than a bunch of diseases You are Barbra Ann Cummings Burrell.. now, what's the last name? Williams Williams... Sally Ally Suzi Boozie light bull traffic. and that's just fine. yeah But I need to know more. It's okay for me to know more, right?

That adoption file said that she cried when she gave you up that she asked if she can visit you. She wished the circumstances would have allowed her to keep you.

I am your mother family Hi, Barb I wanted to tell you that I found my mother. My birth mother. I'm glad you have closure. My mom's name is Geraldine. She cried when she gave me up She was raped but she still loved me. It turns out Corinne tried to adopt me too but she was turned down by Social Services. They wanted me to come here. I guess you think they were wrong. Don't you? I thought you hated me. Me? No. Barbara, I love you, you're my daughter, the only daughter I've ever had. You mean even after everything, you still think about me? I think about you constantly. And your baby? I have five babies now. Five children... Four boys and a girl. You should see them sometime. I'd love that. The thing I hate most is for people to come away from this saying: "well, black should stay with blacks whites with whites" I still believe we have no hope unless we learn to talk together and not talk about ways but talk about love. need a flower girl she's already married mom it's gonna be fine I look okay?

Fine Don is terrific, the kids are terrific. I can't imagine living without them. I do this, too. I put up photographs on the wall We are four generations on our wall Don's side. My side's a little sparse. Can imagine you're gonna have plenty of pictures now. Harold's collecting them. you're gonna have wall to wall comments My Bob was wonderful man. I wish you could have known him. But he wasn't my father. Didn't matter to him. It matters to me. My father was black. A rapist. I read the adoption file. I hate him. Don't. I forgave him the minute I saw you, for you for me. He made the black part of me ugly and I haven't had a great history with white people, so what.. there's no part of me I want to be I never forgot you. I want you to know that first. I was always thinking of you. Even though I spent a lifetime trying to pretend I've never known you... never held you The day I gave you away to Corinne was the worst day of my life. Cry and cry and cry. Why? You are part of me.I loved you. You loved me? You loved me. well you loved me , a little pink baby and then when I started to turn brown you.. No! Said then what? Because I don't understand I'm sorry No, it's all right. it's okay No, it's not ok. I came here to love you. What does love mean? You loved me and you gave me away. I thought I was doing what was best for you. If my father was white would you have brought me home? oh darling, you have no idea... what I did Answer...answer the question If my father was white would you have kept me? I don't know.. probably... yes. But he wasn't white. He was black. And every time I looked at you I'd been seeing him Do you see him now? No. I see you I see my daughter. I see my daughter Barbara Ann. All I ever wanted for you was what I thought was best. I had a dream for you. A dream where you would be with people who could look into your heart. people who could show you a way to walk in this world with pride and courage you weren't gonna get any of that from me I didn't have any courage. I was so afraid. Afraid of what? you I was afraid you hate me Oh God, forgive me. I never even went looking for you when you were grown why? I said "they'll be looking at her skin" "they'll be looking at her skin" And all the time it was me who was looking at your skin All I saw was the color, I never saw you. I'm so sorry, Barbara. I'm so sorry. Mom. My baby. I saved this, something you made for Barbara Thank you for taking such good care of my daughter You're welcome. Call your moms, see what they do! Hey mom!
