All you can do now is cry? You've brought shame to this family! Tell me who is the father? Tell me! Stop it, you don't have to shout. I will keep the baby. I won't get rid of this baby. Bay, what took you so long in the bathroom? Bay. No... I'm not masturbating. I mean, no. Girls. Thanks. - What's up, man? - I'm great. Well, that's your fault. Hey, someone is looking for you? - Who? - Nissa! Thank you, sir. Aryo, Indra, do you know where Bayu is? What is wrong with this kid? Bayu! Hey, Bayu! This is 7 AM. You have to go to school! I need answer for number 3. Look at that attitude, you country girl. Why do I never see Aryo, Bayu and Indra in my class? Just drop them out of the school! Kevin, you should think about yourself... ...and not about others. So you can be more handsome... ...and pass this class. Utama High School Not a Teacher's Car - Take that! - Hope you like it! Shit! Hurry up! Hey, you're trying to skip class, aren't you? Come here. Nothing in here. Bayu, your bag. Okay... - Give me. - Slow down. Indra, your bag. Alright, now get to your class. Sir. That was quick. Can I go to the bathroom? Okay, go on. Hi. Ouch! Ma'am. You've broken article 121A... ...121B... ...121C... ...and 121D. - May I ask something? - Sure. Article 121 is about skipping classes, am I right? - Correct. - And... ...121A to D... Are you trying to mock me? I am a teacher. My statement is based on data. According to Ms. Endang's attendance report... ...all of you never present in her class! You're playing hooky... I mean, skipping class, aren't you? - Don't test him. - Me? Indra! Shut up! Stop whispering! You're a bad nephew, you know that? All you do is brought shame to our family. Whose idea is this? Answer me! That would be me, sir. Ma'am. Oh, so it's your idea. Let me ask you something. Why? Are my class too boring for you guys? I had to skip your class because I... I was trying to avoid a scandal. What do you mean? I admire your beauty. As a teenager, I know very well what I'm lacking. I've tried so hard... ...to hold my feelings... But my admiration to you... ...has turned into love. From the bottom of my heart... ...I'm sorry. So we can go now? Okay, go. Now! I hate Ms. Endang. All she can do is give us punishment. I feel bad for my boyfriend. Marsha, come on. Don't you want to accompany him in on the school yard? Seriously? On the yard? I would need a high level of SPF for that. What about my glowing skin? Aryo! I think she's new in here. She's a sight for sore eyes. She has become the talk of this school. Yeah, she's sweet and chill. Like an ice cream? Lick it and it melts. The massive demonstration in 1998... ...has brought down Soeharto's regime. That already last to 36 years... I have to go to the toilet. Hold my bag and jacket. The toilet is over there. I'm using the one right here. Just let him be. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes. I want to return this pen. That's not my pen. I know it isn't yours. You dropped your pen. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah. See you tomorrow. Hey, are you blind? - Aryo! - Aryo! I know you're the one who messed with my car, you bastard. Yeah, what do you want, asshole? We still haven't finished our last business. I don't want to talk about the past. Now it's your time to feel my punch, you hear me? Good. I'm also in the mood to kick someone's butt today. They're used to be best friends. Who? Aryo and Kevin. They always hang out together... ...with one girl named Naya. I don't know what happened... ...but since Naya left this school... ...they have become nemesis. - Aryo! - Aryo! I have to go. Lana! Wait, don't! - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Lana? Where's Kevin? He had a fight with someone at school. Had a fight? Gang fight? No, just a regular fight? What do you mean "regular fight"? Well, gang fight is you bring the whole gang, this is just one-on-one fighting. - Lana! - I have to change my clothes, Auntie. Lana, come down and tell me. What's the different between regular fight and gang fight? That's still a fight, right? Aryo. Can't you knock first? I can, but I don't want to. Why did you tell about it to my mother? Aunt Suri asked why I didn't come home with you. And you make it as an excuse to tell on her? Now I want you to clean my car. - What? - My car was ruined because of those kids... ...and you have to clean it. That's your car. Clean it yourself. Clean my car, now... ...or I will tell the whole school the reason you moved to Jakarta. Is that what you want? Scrub harder! You will never clean it like that! Now that's better! Smile while you're at it, so my car will be happier. If you keep fighting like that, you won't survive until old age. You mean die young? - Watch your mouth! - Sorry, mom. Drink this. Thank you. So what were you fighting for? - A girl? - Of course not. What for? Remember, you can't date a girl until you finished college. Your cousin is pretty hot. Yeah, but she's a real pain. She was being sent away by her family. So she won't follow her sister's footstep, she got pregnant before marriage. I see. What's wrong with your boobs? - You stupid! - Are you students? So? We're still as big as other men. Listen... ...I need big money, not big penis. - Big money, huh? - Show her, Kevin. What can we get? Whatever you want. Get in. We got it! - Aryo. Evening. - Evening, auntie. Come inside. They're waiting for you. Look, your car is steaming. Hey, anything for my friend. Get her, Vin! He looks like he's having fun. - Hey, No! - What? You jerk! That's gross! Ning, put this in the car. Where's your mom? You should've known. Your mom should've been... Why are you still here? Where's Lana? She can't even make a decent coffee. Excuse me, is the doughnut ready? Sorry, but you're too early. We're still making it. Are you new here? What's your name? I'm Lana. Can I have a glass of warm hot tea, please? Sure, please wait. - Here you go. - Yeah. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Did you just took my picture? Why don't you ask for my permission? You're invading my privacy. Had I ask for your permission... ...I won't get this kind of moment. The opportunity is still there, but the moment won't be the same. Just look at it. This is nice, isn't it? Thanks. - You're not going to drink the tea? - You can drink it. You're paying it, okay? Wait, wait! Just a minute. What do you want? You're pretty. Thanks. Come on, move it! Are you okay? I think I'm on my period. You got it. One! Two! That one is Aryo. A lot of girls in here have a crush on him. But he already has a girlfriend, Marsha. Marsha? Yeah, Marsha. The popular girl from 2nd year? She's... You'll know when you see her. Two! Three! How does it feel getting attention from a handsome senior? Nothing special. I feel kind of creepy. Creepy how? He's so cute. I think I'm having my period. Okay, just go. - You bring one with you? - I do. What kind of hair is that? Hello. - What are you doing here? Get out! - All right. - You're still here? I said get out! - Yes. My stomach hurts... Oh no... Sorry, I think I entered the wrong bathroom. No, no, you're right. I was wrong. Testing, testing, one, two, three. Have you pressed this one? I did, sir. I can't hear anything. This one? - Yes, they can hear you. - Nope. Still nothing. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? They can hear you, sir. Just speak. But where's my voice? If you don't believe me, then check from outside. Alright. Okay, now. Testing, one, two, three. You can hear me, right, sir? Testing... One more time! Testing, testing, testing. - You can hear me, right! - Yeah, I can hear you! See, I told you. Testing, testing. Peace be upon all my beloved students of Utama High School. We invite you to join us in the auditorium after class... ...for a lecture with Preacher Soleh. - One more thing, sir. - What is it? - About the toilet. - Don't whisper to me! About the switched toilets, sir. The switched toilets... - I mean the signs, sir. - Right. To all students, whoever switched the toilet signs... ...we need you to come clean. I will be waiting in the principal's office. Because honesty is... Honesty... - It's good. - It's good. Thank you for your attention. Peace be upon you. Done. Juvenile delinquency has evolved along with technology, don't you agree? Whatever, sir. One example is pregnancy before marriage. I was once a teenager too, you know? - What year was that? - Back in the 90s. Did they have cybersex back then? There was, but still very limited. So there were more of the real sex? Because cybersex is safer, you won't get pregnant with that. Preacher, in a convinience story nearby my house, I saw a condom that says... ..."Teenagers with uniform are not allowed to purchase." So teenagers without uniform can purchase them? Sir. So here's the thing. Teenagers are the age of peak delinquency. You have passed that age. Meanwhile, we're still experiencing it and enjoying it. Maybe later after we've done everything, we can discuss this again. - What do you say? - He's right! Okay, calm down. Now it's my turn to ask. Anyone here pray 5 times in a day? You don't have to answer that. Because worshipping is between ourselves and Allah. And we're always taught to be good and honest. One of the great example is no adultery. You can do it... ...by the way, when you are married. When it's legal and halal. So there won't be any promiscuity... ...and less pregnant teenagers out there. So what do you think? Do you like me better or Aryo? Are you crazy? I did it with Aryo with feelings. But did he? Why don't you just be my girl instead? Aryo already has a girlfriend. What are you doing? Get lost. I have to admit, he's a great kid. At least he's brave enough to say what's inside his mind. You mean their dirty minds every time they saw you? That's not what I mean! Don't your realize? They're teenagers. Every time they saw you, their fantasies are running wild. You're just an object to them. - That's ridiculous. - Ridiculous? That's the fact. Ma'am? Sir? You're not joining the lecture? They're talking about delinquency. - See you tomorrow, sir. - Okay. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Take care. - Ma'am. - Yes. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Take care. - You too, ma'am. See you tomorrow! Yes? Sorry. I'm busy. Are you sure you saw Kevin left the school? I saw him leave the school in his car. But I don't where he went. You should've know better where your son go. You're gone in the morning... ...and he's gone at night time. What kind of family is this? Your pillowcase doesn't match Why do you have to seize my car? Why did I give you a car at the first place? It's no use. You always come home very late, no one knows where you've been. You should take a look at yourself. You're not even very good at school, and you still want a car? Seriously? You don't know who did this? Maybe it's Kevin. No way, why would he do this? But this is pretty scary. This means someone is trespassing into your bedroom. Don't you think letting your aunt would be better in this case? Why? Well, I can figure this out on my own. It's not that hard. Hey, have you seen this filter? Talking about me? Lana, I need to ask you something. What is it? Are you available for sex? What did you say? Can I sleep with you? Just like your sister. What a bitch. Don't. This asshole again. You better stay out of this. What did you say, asshole? I'm warning you. Stay away from her. So what? You're his boyfriend? - Or you had sex with her? - You bastard! Nino's parents just left 30 minutes ago. And we still haven't heard from your mother. - Sueb! - Yes, sir? How is it going? She's not picking up. She kept rejecting my calls. Keep trying. Are you sure that's the right number? Where's your father? - Not your problem. - Damn! This... Yeah, that's the hardest level, sir. Yeah Level 19 is the worst. Don't move the L shape. You're just blocking the box. Switch it like this, or like this. - Sir. - The box is too small, Sueb! - Put that on the side. - Sir! - Sir! - What? Get out of here! Starting today, you're not allowed to attend your classes. Sueb! Sueb! I'm Aryo. I know. I'm Lana. I know that, too. Thanks for helping me back there. Yeah. Yes! Lana, you had a fight with a senior year student? It's because Kevin spread rumors about my family. What does it have to do with me? That's nonsense. Because you're saying silly things to your friends. Enough! Kevin, did you forget that Lana's family is our own as well? Distant family. By the way, stay away from Aryo. You don't what kind of guy he is. Mom? I want to go home. I don't like it in here. I just want to go home. Don't just throw away your dirty clothes Git. Hey, let's have breakfast. Look at this. Oh my God, another one? I think you should start making a list of suspects. I don't have to. I have found a solution. Okay, let's go to the cafeteria. I'm hungry. - You go ahead, I already had breakfast. - Alright then, I'll go. Leave. - What's your name? - Lana. - Who are you to Aryo? - No one. Why did he stood up for you? I don't know. You like him, don't you? Don't you dare try to seduce your senior. You understand? What did they want with you? It's from Aryo. He wants you to eat. He said, "Don't throw this away. It's not a good to throw foods away." Eat it, okay? Or he will be mad at me. Come on. - That freshman looks pretty hot. - Yeah, do you think she's available? - Come on! - Place your bets! - I'm putting a hundred. - Fine, I'm betting my phone! - Does this has money in it? - It must be empty! Is it good? Can you stand up for a minute? This is important. Thanks. Hello, everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. I'm Aryo... ...and this is Lana. Starting today... ...I have a duty to protect her. Whoever tries to mess with her, has to deal with me. Wait, stop it! That's including you, you, you... And especially, you. I can protect myself. Hey, Lana. Sorry about yesterday. I wasn't meant any harm to you. Kevin told me that you're a bad girl. Would you forgive me? Or how about this, do you want to go out with me? We can just hang out or watch movies. Come on, Lana. Don't you trust me? I'm Kevin's best friend. And I'm not as total jerk as he is. What do you think? Let's go. How is it going, Nino? Did you get her? How is it? It won't be long now. Lets go. Where is Lana? I dunno. - This is CCTV, right? - Yeah. Look, I found a CCTV. Sleep tight You're cute Your lamp is dead Your clock is dead too Your pictures are adorable Are you a ghost? Do you want to be my girlfriend? You should tell her everything. She needs to know. Do you think I have to do that? Are you sure? I'm a woman, and I'm sure... ...that you can do it. - What is Bayu doing over there? - I dunno. Let's go. Testing, testing... Good morning, my friends, and those who are not. Can I have your attention, please? I need to say something. Lana, you have to know this. In front of your friends, and those who are not. Today, the world has to know... What is he doing? I'm sure everyone wants to know what it feels to fall in love. Because love is beautiful. And not everyone is brave enough to confess their love. One of them is me. That's why I'm still single. However, I'm just a victim. Because there's someone whose not brave enough to confess. I'm so dead. I'm sure that Aryo... ...feels the same way as Lana. Let's get out of here. - But... - Let's go! Hey, Aryo! I bet you will thank me after this! Let's go. Dear friends, thank you for your time and attention. Lana! Lana! So what is your answer? Do you feel the same way as Aryo? Kevin, Aryo is dating your cousin. He's asking for trouble. Remember, I've warned you. Stay away from Aryo, he's a jerk. Lana, your parents sent you here... ...to prevent bad things happened to you. Especially like what happened this morning. Don't worry. I'm a friendly ghost. Your room looks tidier now. Why don't you just confess to her? Do you have to make it complicated? That's too standard. You're too old fashioned. That's old school. No action. But don't bring me into this. I know why you're doing this. So that you can tell your children about this, am I right? So they can be proud of you, and what you went through. So you can be the hero of the story. But the real hero is me, not you! Can you shut up? Or do you want people to see us and think of us as burglars? If this becomes a history... ...I played an important part in it. But if this fails... ...just you see tomorrow morning. I will announce it on the school yard in front of everyone. Sorry about Bayu and his megaphone. That's so silly. Why don't you tell me straight? Well... Do you really like me? Are you a ghost? Are you a ghost? Do you want to be my girlfriend? Why do you pick the same school as Kevin? Although you two are cousins, but you don't seem to get along. Why not stay in Bandung? My parents wanted this. They want Kevin to look after me. Why? They're just trying to prevent me from having the same accident as my sister. She was pregnant before marriage. And my parents lose their trust in her. And they think by sending me to Jakarta... ...my life would be better. They don't want me to date anyone. But I'm not like my sister. I'm different from her. Honestly... You are the best version... ...of any girl I have known. That's why I like you. Not every man are jerks. Maybe the guy who made her pregnant said the same thing to her. So you think... ...I might do the same thing? Actually, I have some questions for you. But answer me honestly. - Be honest, okay? - Okay, go ahead. Are you dating Naya? I mean, Marsha. Any other questions besides that? There is. Is it true that you, Kevin... ...and a girl named Naya used to be best friends? What happened to you? It's okay if you don't want to answer. I just need to know. Am I in front of you... ...your back, or your side? I will believe anything you tell me. As long as you're honest to me. I just don't want to be disappointed. About Marsha... ...she is not that special. I don't have any feelings with her. We used to hang out together... ...but that's just it. So you mean... ...Marsha is just your plaything? Just to have fun? That means there's a chance you could do the same thing to me. I like you, Lana. Do you want to be my girlfriend? I told you, I don't like seeing you dating like this. Sorry... ...I didn't mean to be rude... ...but you must have a reason why we can't... Why you don't let Aryo to date a girl. Lana, are you sure you want to be his girlfriend? You're still very young, and underage. Aryo... ...you used to ask me... ...why I never let you dating. That's because I don't want what happened to you in the past... ...happens again with you and Lana today. What do you mean, mom? I've been feeling guilty for 17 years. Because I've kept this secret from you all this time. Auntie, please... How can we... ...take care of this baby? Listen. We can't take this child into our family. It's been 8 months... ...we've been living with this disgrace. We can't ruin our family name... ...just because Laila has a child before marriage. This child is a disgrace to our family, so... Please... ...take care of this baby as if he is your own grandchild. We will tell Laila... ...that... ...this baby died. About Laila, well... ...she will forget about the baby. Oh, poor child. Ever since the day I met you... ...I have fallen for you. You... ...an innocent baby... ...whose given away to save a family name. You made me promise to myself... ...that ever since that day... ...I will give my whole life to you. Your grandfather gave your great aunt some money that day... ...and we have been selling cakes. Your birth mother made a big mistake. But that mistake makes me grateful. Because you are a miracle. Your presence makes my life special. You are too precious to me, Aryo. Just like my own flesh and blood. So never think... ...that your existence is just a mistake. To them, you're no more than a disgrace. But for me... ...you are a light that shines the darkness in my heart. So this is the reason why you never get married? Because you choose to raise me? Don't you ever feel regret? That you will live alone... ...and on your own... ...just because you chose me? I never feel any regret. Ever. In fact, every time I see you, when I see your eyes... ...I feel that I have sinned. Because I've been keeping all this lies from you all these years. And every time you call me "mother"... ...I'm begging to God... ...to let me repeat history... ...so that you can be my birth child. I'm really sorry. But you have to know. Being your mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to my life. Aryo! Why didn't I get more followers? Git. Sit here with me. I am officially dating Aryo. Seriously! Oh my God... Seriously? When? Last Friday. I met his mother, too. Oh my God! Spill it! Look. Adorable, isn't it? Oh my God, so all this time... That's so sweet! - He's so handsome! - Thanks. Come here! You two look so romantic. How dare you, bitch! This is going to be viral! Who do you think you are? You think you're his girlfriend? Have you ever date him? Aryo told me everything. You're just nobody. And you're cheating with Kevin, right? Leave me alone, or I will embarrass you even more. Wait... Aryo. You're dating that bitch? You know what she just did to me? You have to explain to her about us. Us? What do you mean "us"? Tell herthat we're dating. I'm sorry? I thought you're doing it with every guys... ...including Kevin? So you're just jealous and you're dating her just to get back at me, is that it? I'm not a drama queen. After all, jealous means you love something. And I never feel jealous. Don't you love me? - Do you love me? - I do. Then why are you giving yourself to anyone? Listen. Starting today... ...there's nothing more between us. You're breaking up with me? Were we dating? You're so heartless. Just like you. - Sa. - Yeah? - Did you see Lana? - No, I didn't. Aryo! I told you, stay away from my cousin! Aryo? You want to repeat what you did to Naya to her? You bastard, I know you made her pregnant! Bima? Excuse me, is Naya here? Naya is not home. Please, I have to see her. This is about Aryo. Lana, please stop crying. Be strong. Excuse me, there's a guest outside. Tell them to come back next time, mom is not home. But they are looking for Miss Lana. That jerk. You have the right to forbid him as his mother. I know, but they are teenagers. We can't tell them what to do. Our job is just monitoring and give them guidance. Especially when they like each other. I think falling in love is normal. Normal? Don't you know that your son made her friend pregnant? I don't want this to continue, now excuse me. You must be Lana. I need to talk to you. What Kevin said is wrong. I never knew who is the father of this baby until yesterday. To be clear, I have no relationship with Aryo. Even if I always like him. I am the witness. Lana. It's not Aryo who made her pregnant. Then who? Naya, I will be over there, okay? - Over there? Okay. - Little bit. Do you like it? It's the best! Thank you, Nino! I have to go! I want you to watch Naya. Take her home, okay? Naya? She's in good hand. Don't let Kevin touches her. Sure thing, man. - Naya. - What? - I have to go. - Alright. Naya. - Thanks, Nino. - Cheers! Drink it. I'm sorry, Kevin... ...Aryo. I have ruined our friendship. No, you're not. Well... At least we know who did this to you. You can relax... ...I will make sure Nino takes full responsibility. Just relax, okay? You have to be strong, don't be afraid. Mark my words... ...if this baby is born without a father... ...you can put my name as the father in the birth certificate. Thanks, but no. I have decided to leave your relationship with Lana alone. Aryo told me a lot about you, Lana. But there is still one thing that makes me wonder. If you knew that he is the mysterious man who leave notes all over your room... ...why didn't you do something about it? I mean, why didn't you confront him? Because that makes me happy. Whenever I'm having a bad mood... ...and reading his notes... ...somewhat makes everything feels better. I felt happier. And every little thing that he did... ...like a doughnut, chocolate... ...that makes me even more comofortable with him. And I don't know why. I fell in love for him once before you. But you don't have to worry. His love is only for you. Are you sure you're okay? I'm sure, Lana. I'm okay. My future is still ahead of me. I just want to declare... ...that I've been wrong all this time to my best buddy, Aryo. I thought he's a jerk... ...an asshole. But it's the complete opposite. Meanwhile, the person that I thought is the closest to me... ...my own best friend. Someone who I felt really close with... ...he always took advantage of the situation. What the heck, Kevin? I'm your friend! Don't you dare call me a friend! Tell me the truth! What did you do to Naya? You jerk! Get up! It's not me... ...it's Kevin. Bastard! You're making my shoes dirty. Now you now everything about me, don't you? Aryo... Do you ever think of finding your real parents? What for? For me, my mother is the only parents I need. She is more than enough. Now it's time for me to take care of her. It would be a waste of time... ...trying to look for my parents who never care about my existence. Now I know why mother don't want me to start dating. Well... I admire you, Aryo. Even if I'm still wondering about one thing. How is it possible... ...that you enter my house... ...through my window and without permission? How did you do that? Love is blind. - What do you mean? - I'm serious. You can't think about love using your logic. You will never get it. It must come from here. I'm telling the truth. I'm so grateful... So grateful that you're still here with me. How far did you two went? - How's her body? - Good. Imagine what is underneath her school uniform? I'm sucking all the evil spirits and dirty minds of this pervert! - How about this? - You mad! What are you doing? You're disgusting! Baby! You pervert. - Oh, right. - What? Actually... ...there is one more thing that I have to tell you. What is it? So here's the thing... Your bedsheet is a mess. You never change your pillowcase, do you? Don't put your dirty dishes under the table. Aryo! Whose condom is this? Shit...
