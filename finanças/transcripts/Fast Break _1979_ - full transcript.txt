David: Wait a minute. You wanna play good basketball, you got to remember one thing-- your head has got to be like a sponge. Hustler: A sponge? Yeah, a sponge, Hustler. You got to remember things. When you do something right, remember what it was. And when you do something wrong, you got to remember not to do it wrong anymore. Can you see anything I'm doing wrong? Yeah, Marvin, your passing. Now, you pass well, and you're accurate, right? But you telegraph every time, Marvin. We should call you Mr. Morse. Beep, beep, beep. It's a joke, Marvin. Forget about it. What I'm trying to say is that your eyes told me where you were going every time. Your eyes. My eyes? You think that's why I didn't get recruited by no college? No. The rest of your game is solid. I wouldn't worry about it. Sometimes the best aren't always picked first. Really? Who wasn't picked first? Who? Cousy. How's that? Who? Bob Cousy. Bob Cousy? Who is Bob Cousy? Who is Bob Cousy? You guys don't know who Bob Cousy is? I never heard of him. Bob Cousy played college ball at Holy Cross. He was drafted by the Tri-city Blackhawks. Right? Now, they're not too thrilled with him, so they trade him to the Chicago Stags team. Now, Chicago folds before the season starts. And Boston gets stuck with this Mr. Cousy, and they're not too thrilled with him, either. He only plays 14 years for them, averages 18.4 a game, and is regarded as the best backcourt man to ever step on a basketball court, all right? My man, the Incredible Spongeman. All right, ok. Yeah! Cousy! Jan? Honey? Janny bananny. I am home. Darlink. Hello. How you doin'? How's every little thing? Everything's ok? Good. Ooh. Stop it. Stop. All right, let me tell you what happened, ok? You said come home between 7:00 and 7:30, right? So 6:45, I left the court, I was on my way home, but... But what? But what? But what? But I happened to run into this guy I was in the army with. I haven't seen him for 10 years. Eddie. And I-- Eddie Bullshit. Eddie Bullshit, and I said, "Eddie, how's your bullshit?" And he said, "Fine. How's yours?" Do you know what that is over there, David? Accordion. Don't get cute. Do you know what that is over there? A phone. That's right. You take your little finger, and you put it in the hole, and you go around 7 times, and you call, and you say you're gonna be home late. It's very simple. You're right. Could we get back to kissing? Stop it. You're all sweaty, and you smell of garlic. I only had one slice. Just one slice. When did you ever have one slice? I had 4 slices and 2 cokes. Why don't you go take a shower? Jan. You're hurting me. Cut it out. I'm sorry. You're mad, and you got a right to be mad, ok? But let's discuss it like 2 mature adults, all right? Mature. A guy spends half of his waking hours throwing a ball into a hoop, and he talks about being mature. Always put me down. It's amazing to me. You can remember who did what to who on a basketball court, but you can't remember to come home in time for dinner. Let's look at the mail. Let's look at the mail. Uh-oh, dentist. I think we'll have to pay this guy. He's starting to get surly. My tooth hurts. So go to the dentist. Hey, I got an answer from this university I wrote. Big deal. "Dear Mr. Greene, I have studied your application "with great interest. "Cadwallader is in great need "of a young and inventive basketball coach. "My wife and I will be in New York City on the 12th. "Please call us at the St. Moritz "to set up an appointment. "Yours truly, Alton Gutkas, president, Cadwallader University." I got an interview. You're crazy. Let me see that. What's the name of this school? Cadwallader. Cadwallader. Mmm. Obviously one of the top 10 schools in the country. Hey, you know, I write a lot of letters, and I finally got an interview. You don't have to be so nasty. I'm sorry. I just don't want you to get hurt. I'm not going to get hurt. Let's go take a shower. You wanna take a shower? Yeah. All right, come on, let's go take a shower. You know, jan, I got a good feeling about this. I'm gonna give you a good feeling. I'm gonna wash your Cadwallader for you. What's the spread on the Knicks tonight? Knicks. Uh, the Knicks are 8-point underdogs. I like the sonics. I'll take the Knicks and 8 for 20. I'll give you 6. It's 8 points in the paper. So bet with the paper, Henry. You're getting senile, you know that? Hey, Bernice, 6.48 and 1.87 is 8.35, not 7.35. Man: So where's the pickles? Got it. That guy on table 4 with the bad suit, says the chicken salad is no good. Which guy? They all got bad suits on table 4. The little one. Hey, mister. Mister, you got to eat half a sandwich to find out it's no good? I thought it'd get better. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too. I gotta charge you for the sandwich. I wouldn't pay a penny. The chicken salad's terrible. What are you talking about? I just made it fresh this morning. I'll charge you for half a sandwich. Can I, uh, help you, sir? Could you spare a piece of bread for a veteran? You wouldn't make a habit of coming in here, would you? No, sir. You promise me. I don't want to see you in here. Let me have a knish for a veteran. Here, come here, come here. Here, take a napkin. Here you go. Thank you, sir. God bless you, sir. God bless you, too. Happy Veteran's Day. Listen, the guys and I are going to the track. I'll be back about 5:00. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I told you I got an appointment at 4:30. Oh, yeah. I'll be back at 4:00. All right. You know, Davey, for my sake, I hope you don't get the job. Why, thank you, Henry. Listen, I got to leave 4:05, whether you're back or not. I'll be back at 4:04. Don't hock me, don't hock me. Excuse me, I have an appointment with Mr. Gutkas. Can you tell me what room he's in? On the house phone, sir. He's expecting me. My name is David Greene. Look, the house phone, sir. They'll take care of you. Mr. Alton Gutkas, please. Mr. Gutkas. Hi, how are you? David Greene. So, how do you like new-- 2307? Ok, I'll be right up. [Knock on door] Mr. Greene? Yes. Alton Gutkas. Nice to meet you. Hello, how are you? Uh, buttercup, he's here. Enid: Great, honey! Come in. Sit down. What are you drinking? Nothing. Uh, tomato juice. Tomato juice. How did you, uh, first happen to hear about Cadwallader? I Grant you, Mr. Gutkas, a lot of people have probably never heard of Cadwallader, but I've always found the school kind of interesting. Sort of, uh, a gem in the wilderness. Yeah, a gem in the-- oh, buttercup, Mr. Greene's always thought of us as a "gem in the woods." You look so pretty. Oh, thank you. Buttercup, I'd like you to meet Mr. David Greene. David, my bride, Enid Cadwallader-Gutkas. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Gutkas. That's Cadwallader-Gutkas. And it's nice to meet you, too. Well, buttercup, what do you think? Well, for a basketball coach, I thought there'd be a little bit more to him. Uh, what Enid means is she thought you'd be taller. Oh, oh. Well, I jump high. I love a sense of humor. He's ethnic, Enid. Enid never met an ethnic before. Did you, buttercup? Well, just a little bitty gardener once. Well, I guess you want to go do your shopping. We going to talk business. Ok. Well, it's nice to have met you. Nice to have met you, Mrs. Cadwallader-Gutkas. Gem in the wilderness, huh? Let's cut the bullshit. Nobody ever heard of Cadwallader. I never heard of Cadwallader until I met Enid. Sit down. But it's there. And I am the new president. And I do not intend to live my life in obscurity. I want to make Cadwallader a name. Some kind of ball team would do it. Football is too expensive. Basketball is only 5 men. That's where you come in. Thank you. Why would you pick me? Well, I liked your letter. You seemed to know the game. You're a student of John Wooden's style... And most of all, I especially like the part where you said you'd work for nothing. I liked that. Well, you didn't take me literally at that. You don't really expect me to work for nothing, do you? Well, I'll give you $50 for every game you win. $50? Cash. A game? When you win. How many games you gonna play this year? Well, we hope to have 30. Maybe 32. Wait, wait, Mr. Gutkas, you say if I win every game, I'm gonna make $2,000. $50 a game. Come on. All right, make it 60. Look, I know it's a long shot, but I'll give you room and board, $60 for every game you win, and I'll give you a regular contract if you beat Nevada State. Nevada State? It's one of the top 10 teams in the country. What are you talking about? That's what makes it a long shot. I told you it was a long shot. But, uh, the day you beat Nevada State, I'll give you a 3-year contract at 30,000 a year. With fringes. You know, I think you're as crazy as I am. But I like your style. This is guaranteed? $30,000 a year for 3 years? I promise. I just got to beat Nevada State? Yeah. Where do I get my players? Anywhere you can. What about scholarships? Well, we'll give 'em room and board and a first-class education for any kid who wants to play with us. Some of the best players I know have a little problem with academics. Not at Cadwallader. Do you get what I mean? You got yourself a deal. All right? Just to be fair, let's make it $100 a game, all right? 60. You got it. I got the job. I never thought that would happen. I was starting to believe it would never happen. When do you start? Here. Immediately. Jan, it's gonna be terrific. They're gonna give us our own furnished apartment, room and board. The food there is supposed to be terrific. And the money, uh... The money's not great the first year. Only 2,500. But all I gotta do is beat this one team, Nevada State, and I make $30,000 a year for 3 years. I'm not going, David. What? I said I'm not going. Why? How can we live on $2,500? We'll manage. It's only for one year. We got money in the bank. You're not touching that money. That money's for the house. What do you mean I'm not gonna touch that money? I said you're not gonna touch that money. It's for the house. Look, that money is half mine, and I'm gonna touch it whenever I want to touch it. I was afraid this was gonna happen. I don't understand it. You have a good job. What do you want to blow it now for? Because now is when I have the opportunity. You have the opportunity to ruin a future. Jan, I want to be a basketball coach. Don't you understand that? When I was coaching in junior high, that was the happiest time of my life. The kids were 12, 13 years old. They didn't know what the hell I was talking about. But this is what I want to do. Well, it's not what I want to do. What about me, David? Don't I count? Jan, I love you, more than I've ever loved anybody. But I'm going to Nevada. I'm staying in New York. [Buzz buzz] [Buzz buzz buzz] Who is it? David: Ma, it's me. Me, who? Me, your son. My son, who? How many sons do you have? Give me your name. Isn't a voice enough? Give me your name! David Benjamin. Davey, it's past midnight. Ma, you know, I think you're getting old. You're looking suspicious. Suspicious, you bet, with the bums in the neighborhood. What was the fight about? There was no fight. Well, what are you doing with the suitcase? Look, Ma, Jan and I, we just came to, like, an understanding. Some understanding. You're here and she's there. I'll tell you what happened in the morning, all right? Good night. Hey, man, it's a chance to get an education. Tomorrow belongs to you. You got to think about your future. Hey, I got my future in the bag. You know how much money I make? Yeah, I can tell by the way you're dressed. Come on, man. I got to dress down, or I scare 'em away. Listen, Leroy, a pool Hustler's life is nothing to look forward to. There's not a lot of longevity involved. Hey, I can go on forever. My act's too cool for these turkeys. Ha ha. Yeah. Too cool for these turkeys. You better watch out. These turkeys get smart, one year, they might have you for Thanksgiving. Hey, what's happening, Hal? Get out! Say what? Say what? Get your ass out of here! Come on, man. I'm only looking to play. Why you talk to me like that? I don't want your action here. I'm gonna see to it you don't get any action in New York. And if you want any action, you'd better get on down to West Virginia. Aw, come on, man. Get out! And take that Puerto Rican with you! [People singing gospel music] Hey, honky, what are you doing here? This is my man. He's here to do a cover story for Time magazine. A cover story for Time? Yeah. All right. Hey. Beautiful. All right. Lord have mercy. Yes, indeed. Bless you. Oh, that's beautiful. All right, bless you. Bless you. Bless you. Bless me. Bless you. Brothers... And sisters. Yeah. I come to you this evenin' a humble messenger of the grand master.... All right! The grand master of the Church of the Celestial Being. Yep. Mm-hmm. I say, I say humble because I am humble. All right! All right! Amen! Amen! Amen! How does he move? What? How does he move? You give him a basketball, he's got more moves than a hundred-dollar hooker. 19 years old. Right out of the Harlem tenement and no education. All right! That's right, sister. No education. But I wears $400 suits... All right! And walks around in $100 shoes, and I drives a brand-new-- which is parked right outside the church-- coupe de ville. Let me hear it from you. Amen! Amen! Amen! Now, I'm going to tell you something else, and then I'm going to get off this stage. You know, the rich people would tell you that poverty is not a crime. Ain't that something? They will actually say that poverty is not a crime. [Applause] And you want to know why they can tell you that? Because they ain't got no poverty. You got it. That's right. David: Watch out! Oh, shit! You crazy man! Give me that gun! Put that thing down, man! Give me that gun! Get the car, bring it around back. Bring it around back. The car? Come on, man, answer the phone. Sonny! Davey, what's going on here? Nothing, mama. Go--go rustle up some food. So what kind of food do these people eat? The same as us. Well, maybe not the same as you. Come on, I'll help you. Come on. Ok. Well, are father Celestial's soldiers gonna guard you? Father Celestial's soldiers are trying to kill me. What? I thought you was his protégé. I was. Leroy, he's got this daughter, see... Hot for my body. So when I was in Chicago, I was living at his house. The chick would come around to visit in the middle of the night. 3:00 in the morning. A man ain't thinking at all. So she's pregnant. So what? Marry her. Leroy, you don't marry God's daughter, especially when she's 15. 15? What do you want from me? I'm only 19. I mean, no place is safe for me, Leroy. Not here, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit. Oh, man, his people are everywhere. Not everywhere. Thank you. Want a coke? No. Ever hear of, uh, Cadwallader University? No, man, I never heard--say what? Cadwallader. No. That's all right. Nobody has. [Whistle blows] [Basketball dribbling] Hey, what's happening, daddy? Any luck? Luck? I've been to 11 places today. Every kid I coached in junior high school. You want to know what the story is? 4 are in college already. 2 are in the air force. One is dead. One is in jail. And the rest, whereabouts unknown. [Whistle blows] Don't ever become a bartender. Your strong point is not other people's problems. Which one is Swish? The one with the ball... And a soft touch. All right! See what I mean? All right! Amazing. You know, I don't understand how come this Bobby James hasn't been snatched up by some college. I don't know. How well do you know him? Not as well as I'd like to. What the hell does that mean? He's a drag queen? No wonder they call him Swish. You mean her. Her? Daddy, meet Roberta James. Bobby. Son of a bitch! I'm already going to college. I start in the fall at CCNY. On a basketball scholarship? Academic. But that's crazy. You should be playing basketball. Oh, really? Who's drafting females these days? Nobody'd let me play with the boys. I'll let you play with me. Shut up, Hustler. You can play on my team. How bad do you want it? Bad. Bad enough to register as Robert James? This is a real nice block here, you know that? Where we going? Right here. In here? Yeah, that's right. Right here, man. You know, I'm not recruiting any rats this year. They eat too much cheese. Come on, man, be cool, all right? We're really going in here? Yeah. Come on, now. Let's go. What's the matter, no doorman? Oh, once you get inside, it's not that bad. Come on, man. Do they have a swimming pool on the roof? Hey. What's happening, ugly? What you doing, Leroy? Hey, all right. Who's this guy, man? Hey, relax. He's cool. Here, I brought you something. Who is this, man? He's a basketball coach, that's all. He don't look like no basketball coach to me. He sure don't. Looks to me more like a pig. Hey, guys, I ain't no pig. Actually, I'm from the landlord, and your rent is overdue. How you doing? David Greene. Hey, man, get him out of here. Hey, lighten up, man. Get him out of here, man. Hey, give me my groceries, man. Let's go. Come on. Hey, you. You'd better forget you ever seen this place. To hell with you, D.C. God, this place is a memory, D.C. D.C. D.C. Dacey. Donald Clarence Dacey. Morris High School, 1976. 28.7 a game. 148 basketball scholarships, turns them all down and disappears. Drops out of sight. D.C. Dacey. Give the man his groceries. Henry: Congratulations. [People chattering] David, this is from the guys at the deli. Oh, the guys at the deli. All right. Yay! It broke their heart. They bought me something. Oh, a whistle. Let's hear it. Let's hear it. [Blows] All right, listen, I want a fast break. Hustler, make a cut between the pickles and the mustard and dunk it right there in the coffee pot. This is--look, I got to open this next. Hey, D.C., have some chopped liver. Go ahead. Enjoy yourself. Billy, you started to smoke? Congratulations. Miss Zukor, thank you very much. Thank you. You always were a classy lady. Thank you. Ma, how you doing, ma? Fine, fine. I don't see her. You don't see her 'cause she's not here. When she comes, you'll see her. You spoke to her? I spoke, I spoke. Give her a chance. I think you should speak to that big kid dizzy. D.C. not dizzy, D.C. Dizzy, D.C.-- what's the difference? Dizzy. Somebody else would like some chopped liver. Like who? Like me. Like you? Yes. I think you had enough chopped liver. What do you think? So, Mrs. Greene, what do you think of your boy? I think he's crazy-- basketball, Nevada. He's a good boy, though. We're going to miss him. L'Chaim. I got one for you boys. Who was the first black player in the NBA? Oh, wow. You see that? You don't know. Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton. He played for the Knicks, 1949. You boys should know that. That's your roots. Say, what was your name? Arnie Dibber. Dibber? Uh, Dibber, who was the first white ball player to play in the NBA? Huh? Ah. Got to get to the roots, boy. Get down. Heh. I'm getting down. So, what was that, about 18 months ago? Whoo. Shot up. Look at her. Excuse me. Nice seeing you again. Hi. Hi. Thanks for coming. Yeah, well, your mom said you're going to be leaving in the morning. I couldn't call you. I had my mother do it. I feel like a kid. So, um... I came by to say so long, and, uh... I hope you'll be very happy. Lottie: Jan. Jan. Hi, mom. You look pale. Are you eating? Yeah. I'm fine. Come and eat. Oh, no, you go and eat. Go ahead. We'll see you later. Have something to eat. Good-bye. You know, maybe I was dreaming, but I had this idea you might show up here with your luggage tonight. I came here because I don't want us to be enemies. That's very nice. Well, I don't want us to be just friends. I mean enemies. Oh, I got something for you. It's a plane ticket. No, no. You don't have to use it. Just take it. It's returnable, refundable. You can get money, anything you want. You never can tell. You could be driving by an airport, and all of a sudden, you get an urge, and, bing, bong, boom, you're in Nevada. Bye, David. I'm scared. I'm scared, too. Preacher: Hey, how's it look? It's quiet, man. D.C.: Hey, man, any cops? Nothing. Come on, relax. Say, man, my pants are getting all wrinkled. The sucker's taking forever. Here they come now. D.C.: What the hell is that? Preacher: Ha ha! Look at that walk. [Laughs] We got to spend 3 days in a car with a--with a... Hey, man, he lays one hand on me, I'm going to deck his ass. [Laughs] Cute. [Backfires] David: Hey, look at that cow over there. Moo! Hustler: Man, to hell with the cow. How we going to play ball with 4 players, huh? Right. We're going to manage, that's how. Finding 5 players dumb enough to go to Caberlac-- Cadwallader. Let's talk about why you're here. Say, let's talk about why you're here. Who cares why anybody's here? Wait a minute. Hey, Swish. Hey, Swish, don't you talk? I let my feet run, not my mouth. Others: Oh! I heard that, Swish. All right. That's cold. Now, that was really cold. Heh heh. All right. Lookie here. The Lord hath rolleth, but the Preacher man takes it away. I hear you. I heard that. Give me that. Say, coach, what's this Cadwallader place look like? Are you finished insulting each other? There's a brochure right in there. Take a look at that. Yeah. Go ahead. Splendor in mid-America-- Nevada. Is that mid-America, Nevada? What's this place look like? Oh, will you look at that? Mmm, mmm, mmm. Honky heaven. Look at that. Here you go, coach. Preacher: You want some of this? No, thank you. No, thank you? Hey, come on, man, why don't you loosen up? I mean, get down. Hey, coach-- Hey, listen-- Hey, listen, get your fill of that stuff now, because once we get to Cadwallader, you become athletes, not junkies, all right? Junkies? Yeah, junkies. Preacher: What've we got ourselves into this time? ♪ Jump right in ♪ You'll feel alive ♪ Take the blows ♪ But know that you'll survive ♪ ♪ Put your marbles on the line ♪ ♪ If you lose, it ain't a crime ♪ ♪ Win or lose, you've got the team ♪ ♪ So keep your eye upon that dream ♪ ♪ And go for it ♪ Go for it ♪ Go for it ♪ Go for it ♪ Now, now, now ♪ Now, now, now ♪ Now, now, now ♪ Go for it now ♪ Go for it now ♪ Go for it now ♪ Oh, keep your eye upon that dream ♪ ♪ Now go for it now ♪ Go, go, go, go Quiet.

Coach, just drive careful. Roll down the goddamn windows! Get rid of your marijuana. How am I going to do that? Throw it out the window. Don't throw it out. They'll see it. Lord, man, they're going to bust us for sure! Throw it out the window, will you? Don't throw it hide it. Out the window. D.C.: There ain't no place to hide it! Throw it out the goddamn window!

It's just, like, uh, you know, um, rustic. They're here. Send them in. Oh. Wait a minute. Put some black music on. [Music playing] The Mills Brothers: ♪ If I didn't care... You can come in now. David: Thank you. Thank you. Alton, how are you? Nice to see you again. Come in, come in. How are you? How you been? Fine. Listen, I'd like you to meet the team that's going to make Cadwallader famous. This is D.C. Dacey. This is Leroy Monroe. This is Tommy white, and this is Bobby James. Mr. Gutkas. Well, boys, welcome to Cadwallader. I'd like you to meet Howard Groper. He's our team manager. How you doing, Howie? If you need anything, you just ask Howard. Yeah? How about a new gym? Oh, don't you worry about that. We're getting it repaired. Now, we want you to have the best we can offer. Our academic standards are high. When you leave here, you'll have an education second to none. Cut out the "boy" jive. I mean, this is a university. How are we going to get in? You're in... Men. David: What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Did I tell you that? I told you, right? All right. All right. Howard, you show them into their rooms. If you boys will follow me... Well, look, it's not really that bad. I mean, maybe some plants or-- Plants. Now, that's a good idea. As a matter of fact, I even brought some seeds. Oh, yeah, well, see, the soil here is very fertile. Ok, you guys want to choose up living squads? Yeah. Say, Hustler, you want to shack up with me, man? I was thinking about shacking up with Swish. Preacher: Hey, you got it, man. I'm with you. Me and you, Preacher. On second thought, I want my own room. We all want our own rooms. Wait a minute. Time. Listen. I hate to tell you this. This school is very overcrowded. There is no way. It is an absolutely inconceivable fact for you to have Howard... Your own-- Do it. Preacher: Yeah, man. Ok. D.C.: Right. God! Man! I'm waiting until the heat's off, then I'm getting the hell out of here. You going to let coach build a team and then walk out on him? Hey, man, I got to look out for myself. See? That's all you ever do, D.C. Son of a bitch! I'm going to kick your ass! I don't take no shit from no fag! Nah, Swish ain't no fag, man. I've known him since we were kids. Well, then he's latent. Late or early, it don't make no difference, man. A fag's a fag. Ha! I heard that. Ha ha! [Swish humming] We got to find a fifth man out of that? Hey, uh, worse comes to worse, I'll shave off my beard, and I'll play. Aw. [Laughs] All right. Let's find out what kind of shape we're in. [Blows] Gentlemen, good afternoon. I am Coach Greene. Hello, Coach Greene. Hello, Coach Greene. Ok. Now, these gentlemen are the new additions to the team. I'm sure you heard about them. This is Hustler, this is D.C., this is Swish, and this is Preacher. Ok, let me have the ball. Thank you. Let's get started right away. You stay on the court, and you stay on the court. Everybody else to the sideline. Uh, Hustler, Swish, stay on the court. D.C., Preacher, come on, let's go, off the court. Now you guys are going to play defense. You set up. You guys play offense. Bring the ball down. Let's see what we got here. Ok. Good. [David blows whistle] David: Let me have the ball. Come on, quick. Let me have the ball. What's your name? Larry. It's very important to always keep your body in between your man and the basket. Now, I know you're looking for the outside shot, but don't let him go in on you. Keep your body between-- You hear me? Keep your body between the man and the basket. Let's try it again. Keep your body in between the man and the basket. All right. [Blows] David: Ok. Good try, Larry. You four guys off the court. OK. 2 on 2. You four off. You, get on the court. You, get on the court. Preacher, D.C., bring the ball down. Come on, let's go. Move it. [Blows] Let me have the ball. Now I want everybody to pay close attention to what Preacher just did, because you're never going to see it again. That was a demonstration of Harlem Globetrotter bullshit. Man: Whoo! All right. Whoo! Let me have the ball. When you dribble, Swish, keep the ball low-- No higher than your knee. How low can you go? No higher than your knee. Not so much fancy stuff. You, what's your name? Alec. Alec, come over here. Yes, sir. I don't know if you're going to make the team or not, but if you do, buy a jock. Let's move it. Move it. Come on. Watch him. Quickly. Passing, passing. Move the ball. Move the ball. [Blows] Hustler, what'd you do? I dunked the ball. You hung on the rim! That's a technical foul! No hanging on the rim! [David blows whistle] Damn, man! This is basketball, fool! Sorry, man. Sorry, my ass. Get somebody else in there. Preacher. Preacher, come here. You're embarrassing me. This looks very bad. This is my first day as coach. Now go back in there. Hey, well, he better not do it again. Come on, play ball. Let's go. Whoo! Make up your mind what you're going to do, Hustler. You mother-- Hey, just cool it. I don't want to hurt you. Now back off. Just relax now. David: All right. Hey, hey. Now back off. All right, let him go. Let him go. You ok, buddy? Let him go. He's ok. All right, all right. What's your name, son? Sam Newton, sir. Did you play ball for Cad last year? No, sir. I'm a freshman. A freshman? Where'd you play your high school ball? I played football. Hey, I believe it. But cad doesn't have a football team. Oh, so you thought you'd play a little defensive tackle out here, huh? All right, Hustler, come over here. Come on. Everything all right between you two guys? No hard feelings. An honest mistake. Restitution, all right? Ok, we're going to play a little 5 on 5, all right, Sam? I want you to play with the 4 boys from New York. I mean the 4 guys from New York. All right, let's get on the other team... I want, uh, Larry. Howard said you wanted to see us, Coach. Yeah. You could've took a shower first. It wasn't that important. That's all right. Gentlemen-- Krebs, Hollis, the game of basketball is not always won and lost by how good you play. Frequently, it's about how bad you can make the other guy play. Now, you agree with that, Hollis? Good. I'm glad you agree with that. Now, once in a while, it's necessary to use what you call a little, um, psychology. That's where you two come in. Preacher: Jesus, man. [David blows whistle] Aah! Ohh! All right, all right, all right. Hey, man, he tripped me on purpose! Sit down! Sit down, my ass, man! You hit him already. Sit down. Hollis: Uhh. Preacher: Sucker. David: You ok? You all right? You're not even bleeding. It's ok. It's all right. It's ok. Come on, get up. Get up. Get some air. Get up. Come on. Walk around a little bit. Let's go. Come on, Hollis, it's all right. This was a good job, Hollis. You got to learn how to duck, though. It's very important. Good afternoon, Mrs. Tidwell. Good afternoon, Mr. Greene. Uh, I understand we have a bit of a problem here. No, Mr. Greene, you have a problem. Donald Clarence Dacey does not belong in this university. Come on. I think you're overreacting a little bit. Mr. Greene... Mr. Greene, the boy cannot read. Well, that makes him an average college student. [Laughs] I fail to find anything very amusing in that. I have had to flunk this boy on his English midterm. How bad was it? Zero. Uh... Flunking him means that he won't be able to play basketball. Now, I'm sure Mr. Gutkas and the whole Cadwallader family are going to be very upset, because we all realize what this boy can do for the university. Destroy it scholastically. Look, Mrs.-- I don't know about Mr. Gutkas, but I'm sure that the whole Cadwallader family will understand. Mrs. Tidwell, could I-- Ms. Tidwell. Ms. Tidwell. Nancy. Nancy. Nancy... I'm not asking you to do anything immoral or illegal. All I'm asking you to do is give the boy another chance. Sports is his life-- you know, the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat. I've never known the thrill of victory. Well, this is your chance. This is your opportunity. Every time Donald Clarence Dacey scores a basket, you'll know that you were partially responsible. I'm afraid that-- Nancy, don't be afraid. Could we have another Margarita for the lady? No, really, please. I don't drink. One more. Just one more. I'll have another one later. One more for her. Bring her another one. I'll have one later. Nancy, what are you afraid of? I'm afraid that's impossible. There's-- what's-- nothing's impossible. Look at yourself, Nancy. You're a well-educated, attractive, sexual white woman. You come from a upper-middle-class background in Nevada, but we're talking about a black kid from the streets of New York-- underprivileged, undereducated-- Grew up with crime, drugs, poverty. You know what it is to grow up in a ghetto? To have your spirit stunted before it can grow, before it can blossom? Nancy... Nancy, I'm asking you to be more than an educator. I'm asking you to be... A human being-- a caring, feeling, thinking human being. His future is in your hands. Nancy... Don't let us down. [Knock on door] D.C.: Enter at your own risk. Here you go. Merry Christmas. Oh, you cleaned up your room. Very nice. What is this, man? What is this? My friend, you got one week to pass your English exam, that's it. What are you talking about? I couldn't pass that exam if I had a year. I had lunch for 2 hours today with Ms. Tidwell. That's special detail overtime, so you're going to try and pass your exam. Hey, look, I came here to play basketball, not get no education. Look, if you don't pass this exam, you don't play basketball. Simple. Fine. I don't play basketball. What kind of attitude is that? Why do you have an attitude about everything? You got an attitude about this. You got an--we'll call you Mr. attitude. That's going to be your new name--Mr. attitude. What if I fail? If you fail, you fail. That's the way of the world. Just try. All I'm asking you to do is make an honest effort. You can't do that for me? Will you look at them books, man? I couldn't get through one of them in a week. Just try! If there's something you don't understand, I'll give you a synopsis. Now, Swish-- a what? A synopsis--I'll boil it down for you if there's something you don't understand. Swish is going to help you. Any night you want, Swish is going to be there. Oh, no. Oh, what's wrong with Swish? You got an attitude about Swish now, attitude about everything. Mr. attitude--"I don't--" Swish is an "a" student. Yeah, well, that figures. Yeah, that figures. Attitude, attitude, attitude. Everything's an att-- I think this is alive. I just saw it move. All right, follow me. Let's do it. Change pace. Change speed. Change direction. Pace, speed, direction. Very good, very good. That's 3 in a row. Ok, now, in the devil and Daniel Webster, which was written by... Uh, Benet. Benet. Benet who? Benet Goodman? Wait a minute. I don't know. Stephen Vincent Benet, all right? David: I want to see a lay-up. No jump shot. Left hand. All right. Good, good. Good, good. All right, let's do it again. Come on. Good. No jump shot. Lay-up, lay-up, lay-up. [Cheers] "All languages being imperfect, it does not follow that one should change them." Who said that? Rick Barry. I don't know who said that. Rick Barry? No, it was Darryl Dawkins. Who said it? Voltaire. Voltaire said it. He sounds like a faggot. Everybody sounds like a faggot to you. Voltaire said it. Voltaire, Voltaire, Voltaire. Above your head. Beautiful, Hustler. Give him a good pass. All right, let's go. Come on, let's go there, Larry. 2 hands above your head. Pass it. Let's go. Come on, move that ball. Here you go. Sam, 2 hands. Give him a good pass. That's it, Sam. Better. It still stinks, but it's better. There you go. Bacon has been accused of ordering what important science? Physical sciences as they pertain to the development of man. All right. Maybe you get to shoot a basket or 2. David: Preacher, watch the man and the ball. Don't leave the middle open, Preacher. Don't leave the middle open, 'cause this could happen. Very easy. That could happen, Preacher. Describe the essence of the character of Gatsby. D.C.: What? Describe--describe the essence of the character of Gatsby. You're crazy! David: Everybody is watching the man and the ball. Everybody is watching the man and the ball. Everybody's keeping their eye on the man and the ball. The man and the ball. [Player laughs] Preacher: Keep your eyes on the man and the ball. I think we're ready. D.C., I think we're ready. All right, Mr. Dacey, please discuss the differences in style between Hemingway and Fitzgerald. What's the matter with you? I can't do it, man. I got these needles and pins in my hands and feet. Mr. Greene, I'm afraid it's a waste of time. No, no, it's not. Just don't think about your hands and your feet. How don't I think about it? Huh? I mean, how do I do that? But the key to Hemingway, you see, is simplicity in language. Uh, like take the characters that he deals with. Like the dude in, uh... In the old man and the sea. Just hop into his boat, go out looking for tuna, come back, he's cool. But, now, Fitzgerald, Fitzgerald... He deals with the rich folks, and rich folks are a lot more complicated, you know. I mean, they are... Far more hung up. Less drama in his work, a lot more... A lot more psychology. Is that all? You pass. Yay! All right! Goddamn it, man, control yourself! Don't pull that jive crap on me! Sorry. Goddamn fruit fly. [Cheering] Go, C.U.! Show what you can do! Go, C.U.! Show what you can do. No challenge, no rule, can beat the gold and blue! [Tweet] [Buzzer] [Spectators applauding] David: All right, execution. Let's go! All right! All right, down. Get down, Swish, get down on the drive! [Cowbell ringing] David: Sam, watch the corner. All right, rebound. Get the ball! Fast break! Fast break! Fast break! [Coaching continues] Cheerleaders: C.U.! [Clap clap] C.U.! [Clap clap] C.U.! [Clap clap] De-fense! [Clap clap] De-fense! [Clap clap] [Cheer continues] Preacher: Let's go. Try to keep 'em busy. Swish, watch the ball, watch the ball! Whoo! Execution. Execution! All right. Sam, watch the corner. Referee: Personal foul, 31. Blocking. 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... [Buzzer] We win, you son of a bitch! All right! Whoo! I feel like a kid sneaking into the movies. Yeah, I did that quite a bit. I bet you did. Bo always sits on this side of the gym. There's the king. He looks bigger on TV, doesn't he? Oh, well, he's big, all right. He just about runs this city and the whole state. Move it! Move it! David: Look at those guys. They don't look so threatening from up here, do they, Howard? If you don't mind me saying so, Mr. Greene, getting state to play Cadwallader should be about as easy as getting the Ohio state buckeyes to play football with Radcliffe. Howard, you're 100% right. That's where you come in. Me? You. See that man down there? That man is the enemy. Enemy. I want to know everything about him. His fears, his family, his weaknesses. I want to know what he does on Saturday, what time he goes to the bathroom. I want to know everything about him. Howie, you understand what I'm asking you to do? I thought you'd have some conception of what was going on. Intensity! Intensity! Come on! [Cheering] Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! [Cheer continues] [Tweet] Number 20. Blocking. [Tweet tweet] I'll put your ass down! Break it up! Break it up! Come on, you guys-- Back it up! Come on! Let me get him, man! Come on, let's get him! That's not necessary, men. We're leading by 36 points. 100... 100! 100. 100! Morning. Morning. Hi. Morning. [Knock on door] Enter. Coach? We made the Reno paper. Let me see it. "Greene Sparks Cadwallader. "A new voice is being heard in basketball circles. "Cadwallader University, "which has been a poor, sick cousin "in the basketball community, "seems to have received a shot of adrenaline. "They stand undefeated after 5 games, "trouncing their opponents by as much as 40 points "and having scored not less than 100 points every game. "President Alton Gutkas has imported "coach David Greene from New York, "and this young man has fielded a team "of top 10 caliber. State university, take notice." Howard, we got their attention. What do you got for me? Very professional. "Winnegar project." Coach, the man is as pure as ivory snow. I checked him out from the time he was born. I even tailed him for a week. I put a bug on his telephone. You what? You said he was the enemy. He has no mistress, that's for sure. No one-night stands, no problems at home. He does have one daughter, so I thought maybe we'd hire some young stud, you know, to hit on her, work that kind of thing. She's married, she's got 3 kids, you know, she's not having any affairs, neither is Bo's wife. I checked her out completely. You know, they have been married for 35 years. So I thought what I'd do is I'd hire some hooker to hit on Bo, you know, but it would cost a few dollars, so I thought... You know, that I should speak to you. Mr. Greene? You put a bug on his phone? Yeah. You want to pay the money? No, Howard, I don't want to pay money for any hooker. Howard, you put a bug on his phone? Do you want me to keep on top of it, or... Yeah, Howard, no more hookers or bugs on phones, but keep on top of it, all right? I have some other things. Yeah, all right. Howard, what's your major? Political science. Coach, your last win was a pretty easy one for you. You think that's going to benefit you at all in getting ready for your next game? I think everybody should learn something from every game, win or lose. Uh, well, how do you feel about State? I think it would be a good game, I think it would be a close game, I think it will be a fair game. Reporter: I'd love to see that game. So would I. All right, Hustler, let's go. Sharp cuts there. Make those cuts sharp. Sharper. You both would like to see that game, coach, but apparently, Bo Winnegar wouldn't. Well... I wouldn't say that he doesn't want to see that game. I would say that, um... I understand the man's position. He's got one of the top 10 teams in the country, he's got a tremendous won-and-lost record. Now, why jeopardize that by playing a bush-league team like Cadwallader? From his point of view, it doesn't make sense. Coach, are you saying that Bo Winnegar is afraid of you? No, I didn't say he's afraid of me. I never said that. Don't print that, because every time I say something, something else gets printed. I said that I can understand his position. Thanks, Coach. Let me have the basketball. Don't he ever take a shower? Oh, come on, man, let's go. What the hell kind of game are you playing, Greene? Basketball. Come on! You know what I'm talking about. Shooting your mouth off like that to all those reporters. Now, wait a minute, Bo. I happen to have the highest respect for you, and if anybody said anything other than that, I'm going to sue them for libel. Well, what's this talk about me being afraid of you? Bo, I never said that. You know how those guys are. They're trying to get us into a shooting match. Well, I don't need it, and I don't want it. I got enough headaches inside my own league. All right. Hey, uh... Bo? Yeah? Uh... I feel funny saying this, but you're one of my idols. Well, uh, thank you. You know, even my style of coaching comes right out of your book. Oh. You read my book? Did I read your book? I wouldn't have got this job if I didn't read your book. Ha ha! Well, I don't believe it, but it's a hell of a good story. I'd like to meet you sometime. Well, I'd love to meet you. It would be my privilege. How about, uh... How about Saturday night? Look, we have a game, and you don't. Why don't you come over? I'm sure Mr. Gutkas would be happy to entertain you. I might take you up on that. Put the dwarf on. "Put the dwarf on"? Dwarf. Hello, Bo. [Laughing] Boy, you are unbelievable. That dude still thinks that he can whip you. Hey, that's just what I want the man to think, you know. It's funny, though. Hello, hello, hello, hello. Hey, what's happening, Coach? A quarter to 1:00, that's what's happening. Well, Coach, you see, this gentleman and myself just went into business. This is the killingest shark to ever swim into a poolroom. I heard that. What are you doing with a cigar? Hey, look, no, coach, checkyou this out. A big shot? I've been wasting my time saving souls. Amen, brother! It's a quarter to 1:00. It's 11:15 curfew. Now got to sleep. You got classes in the morning. Go ahead. Don't let this happen again. All right, we'll see you in the morning. Yeah. Good night. Hey, uh, Leroy. Yeah? How much money you win? Uh, I didn't get a chance to count it yet. I got class in the morning. I'll see you later, all right? Got class in the morning. Get rid of that cigar! Are you really the best? Goddamn, coach, you ought to learn how to knock. You going to get yourself hurt! Are you really the best at shooting-- Is he really the best at shooting pool? Coach, let me put it to you this way: He is to pool what Dr. J is to basketball. You sure? Hey. Yeah! All right. All right. Fool charging into a room like that-- Get rid of the cigar. What do you need a cigar for? Oh, my goodness oh, man. [Cheering] Put your hand in his face! All right. Come on. David: Let's go. Pass it to D.C. D.C. D.C., get down there! Get down there! What's the matter with you? Leroy: I got your man! Pick up mine! Pick up 43! Come on, D.C.! D.C., come on! I'm going to get on his ass at halftime. Hold him! Watch the screen! Watch the screen! [Buzzer] All right, come on, let's get in there. Let's go. Come on, move it. Hey, is he here yet? No. Well, is he coming? I don't know. The way you guys are playing, I hope he never shows up! Let's go! Get in there. Come on, just relax, all right? D.C., fight through the screen! Howard, leave us alone for a while. If Winnegar gets here, let me know when he gets here. What the hell's the matter with you? What are you, stoned or something? Hey, man, back off. You smoking dope? Not bad enough you're missing the easy lay-ups, you're not even hustling out there! Well, take me out! He's having an off night. Leave him alone. Leave him alone?! Leave him alone?! This is a basketball game, my friend! This isn't a group therapy session! We should be destroying this goddamn team out there! We're winning by 8 points! They got momentum, they got every-- We could lose this game! You know why? He's playing like a big shit! And the rest of you are playing like little shits! [Calmly] All right, D.C., listen, you're having an off night. Stop shooting so much. Feed Preacher. Preacher's hot. Yeah, I--I'm open out there, coach. I mean, set some picks or something-- Shut up! Let me coach the team, all right, Preacher? Set some picks for him. He's hot. He's right. And why aren't you shooting, Swish? You got the ball, you got shots, take 'em! Don't be Mr. Nice Guy, passing all the time. Take those shots when you got 'em. And, Sam, you got 3 fouls on you already. Watch that. I don't want you to foul out. And open up that offense. Open up the middle. Let Hustler get the ball. Feed him. You're not feeding him enough. And when you miss a shot, pound that offensive board! Pound it! Offensive board, Hustler! Important! Man, you putting us down, you know that? I'm sorry. This game happens to be very important to me. It's important to everybody in this room, so let's do it, all right? All right, get a drink of water, go to the bathroom. You got a nice gym. We've just done the floors. Yeah. It looks good. Man: Bo, how you doing? Hi there. Coach? Hello, boy. How are you? Fine. We got a nice seat for you right over here. No, no, I'll sit right here. Ok, come on. All right. Let's go! Let's get out there! Let's go! Come on, let's do it. Come on! All right, let's go. Get out there. Bo. How are you? Hey, how are you, coach? Thank you for coming. Here's our man. Look at that score. Are you resting your first-string? Well, Bo can tell you it's not nice to embarrass your opposition. You mind if I sit down here on the bench with you? I don't like to sit in the stands. You want to sit on the bench with me? We got a nice seat for you right up there. You don't want to sit there? Sure, go ahead. Sit on the bench. Well, what do you think? Cadwallader's finest. What'd you do, empty the ghetto? I got to get to work. Get your hands in the air! Get your hands in the air. 40... 50... 60... 65... 66... 67... 68... 69... 70. 70? You're a real human being. [Disco music playing] Hey... All right! Aw, look at Hustler. Hustler, all right! Hey, what's happening? You look good. Yeah, well, did you read the memoirs? He got, uh, phlebitis of the leg. The man suffered. I mean, it's unbelievable. I went up to the western white house, you know, in San clemente, you know, on the bus tour. Gave you a good break, didn't I, Bo? Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Yeah. I don't know, Bo. You play an awful good game of pool. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. In fact, if you look on page... I think it's 47-- How many times do I have to tell you? How loud do you want to hear it? I'm not interested in you! Why don't you go away? And then it's like nobody voted for him. I mean, he won, didn't he? Somebody had to have voted for him. So, tell me something, Bo, what'd you think of my team? You got no bench. Just one of your players fouls out, you're in trouble. And this kid D.C. Dacey, he has any talent, he sure was hiding it. Well, you know, he had an off night. Happens once in a while. And that white kid should be playing linebacker for the rams. And that kid Swish... If he isn't gay, he's on his way. Well, I'll tell you something, Bo, I don't deal in personalities. He's a hell of a shot. [Shoots ball] He's a great shot, but he's got no muscle. Get his little butt bounced off the court. You know, Bo, you're really putting down my team. We won 114-70. It's not chopped liver. With that competition? Baxter's pretty good. They're 8 and 2. [Shoots] Tough luck. 8-ball in the side pocket. Don't get nervous. Don't worry. It's not an easy shot. Be careful. You know, Bo, I'll tell you something. If I didn't know what a gentleman you are, I'd think I was hustled. There was a time I made my room and board with the pool cue. So you need my $40? Am I a millionaire-- [knock knock] Hey, Leroy! Come on in here. I want you to meet Bo Winnegar. Say hello to Leroy Monroe, my best player. Hello, Mr. Winnegar. Leroy, I want to tell you, you're one hell of a good player. Thank you, sir. Another game, Dave? Oh, no. Forget it. Play friendly, no money, all right? It's no fun if there's no wager. Uh, could I play Mr. Winnegar? I don't take money from students, son. Oh. Looked like it would've been fun. You really want to play? Yeah, definitely, coach. You know how to play 8-ball? Yeah. Sure. I'll tell you what: He played a good game today, I'll put up his $20. What do you say? Take my money? Rack 'em up. All right! Solid! "Rack 'em up." "Solid." Here's another $20. Hi. Never figured you to pass on a party. Um... I-- I was just getting some air. I'm going back now. You mad at me? No, I'm not mad at you. Well, what's the matter? You afraid somebody will see us alone together? We're not together. What is this? We're just talking, that's all! I don't bite, you know. [Whispering] Hey, man, will you watch your mouth?! Somebody hear you talking like that, they'll run us both off-campus! Oh, now I got to watch even what I say to my own teammate! [Sobs] What are you--what are you doing, man? Crying? Hey, look, you're 19 years old. You walk around here like a goddamn woman, you talk like one, you even got feelings like one! Do I lie? Do I cheat? Am I some kind of criminal? Why the hell do you talk to me this way? Because you make me uncomfortable, that's why! You think I'd be interested in somebody like you? Will you watch your mouth? Well, what do you want to talk about, basketball? Hey, man, I--I got to go. [Sobbing] Hey, come on, Swish. Hey, look, man, pull yourself together, will you? I got to go. No! It's your goddamn bench. You stay. You know, he got more electoral votes than Humphrey did. He was an amazing campaigner-- What are you, glue-all? Well, I mean, I was just trying-- There is nothing about you that interests me. Do you get that? Ohh... Another one, Mr. Winnegar? How much do I owe you? How much you owe? You owe me. $4,920. I can't believe it. I'll have to write you a check. I don't want your check. But I don't have the cash. What do you mean you don't have the cash? What's that, a joke? That's all right, coach. I don't want your cash. Well, what do you want? Want to play basketball against his team 2 weeks from Saturday? Yup. That's impossible! You know that. Hey, Bo, that's not impossible, 'cause you owe me almost $5,000. Tell you what I'll do. One more game. You win, your debt is clean. You lose, you play us 2 weeks from Saturday. Rack 'em up. Ok. Let's call for break. Heads. Tails. Son of a bitch! All right! You son of a bitch. You set me up. All right! Hey, Bo, I'll see you 2 weeks from Saturday. [Door closes] All right! Yeah! How do you like that guy calling me a son of a bitch? What did I do? Oh, no! New York bus in 2 hours. Where you going? New York. New York. You don't like the bus? You gonna walk? If I have to. Wait a minute. Just calm down. Why are you throwing away your whole future to go back to some condemned building in New York? What about everybody else's future? What about Preacher? What about Hustler? What about me? Hey, coach... It's personal. I'm sorry. I don't know what it is, man, but it's something real weird. What the hell is going on? Tell me! Let me help you. Will you tell me? All right, man. Do you want 2 fags on your team? What? I think I'm a fag. Come on. I'm serious, man! I never felt this way in my whole life! What way? Look, man, don't tell anybody. It's that goddamn Swish! Is that what this whole thing is about, Swish? You find yourself attracted to Swish. Find yourself watching that cute little ass as it glides down the court? You're turned on by Swish. You want to hug him, and you want to kiss him. You're overprotective... Nothing wrong with that, D.C. Oh, no. Not you, too? There's nothing wrong with me, and there's nothing wrong with you, either. Man, when you start looking at a guy like you would at a girl, I mean... Damn! Yeah. Yeah. But that doesn't apply when, uh, when the guy is a girl. What? Swish... Girl. [Knock on door] Come in. How are you doing? All right. Just wanted to apologize for the way I treated you. I really shouldn't have treated you that way. Ok. Can I sit down? You're real attractive, you know that? I guess I was about 14 when I realized I liked boys. I think you'd better go. Hey, come on! You said you was lonely. I mean, I understand that. I've been lonely lots of times. D.C., cool it. You're out of line. How about if I move in with you? Out! Hey, ok, ok. If you won't let me move in with you, at least let me see you. We could go off-campus. Restaurants. Movies-- Will you get out of here? Motels... I'm crazy about you, baby. If you don't get out of here in 10 seconds, I'm calling campus security. No, don't be that way, Roberta. You son of a bitch! Roberta James. You know, I was at the bus station today ready to leave town when the man told me? God, woman, I feel like I'm born again. [Sobbing] Lord, you're the cryingest woman I have ever seen. You know that? [Doorbell chimes] Lottie: Hello, stranger! Hi, mom. If I'm still mom, you're still my daughter. I'm making some tea. You want some? That would be nice. That would be nice. All right. Ok. What do you mean that's why you're here? Mom, please don't get involved. He sent me this ticket to go see this big game in Reno. It means a lot to him that I should be there, and I would like to, too, but... I'm 65 years old. I never been on an airplane in my whole life. It scares me. Would you go with me? Mom, I can't-- You're not working. It's on the weekend. Mom, I'll tell you what, ok? I'll drive you to the airport, I'm gonna put you on the plane, but I cannot go. Mom, please be reasonable. I don't know what that is anymore. I used to think I did. Jan... I had a chance once to go on an airplane. Me and my husband were young then, and his uncle wanted him to go with him to Los Angeles and open a business. Sol wanted to go. Not me. I was scared. In 1945, Los Angeles was like going to Poland. Besides, my family was here, my friends. So so I said, "Come on the plane, just to visit. See for yourself." I wouldn't go. Because I was a strong lady, he stayed. I wonder often what would have happened if we'd have moved to Los Angeles. An easier life? Would he have lived an extra day, another year? I have one son, and as much as I love him, I've always thought he was a little crazy. Now I find out he's a big celebrity. He wants me to see for myself. Ok, Mom. We'll go. [Cheering] [Chattering] I can only sign a couple, ok? There you go. I'm late, all right? ...for the championship. It was against Rhode Island. It was a terrific game. We scored 43-- Mr. Greene? Yeah. I'm officer wedgewood with the Benson police department. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. I hate to be the one that breaks bad news, especially on a night like tonight, but the New York police spotted your team's picture in newswe magazine. I have a warrant for D.C.'s arrest. Now I'm late. This is the last one, ok? Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. [Whispering] Holy shit. All right, now, wait a minute. Let's look at this rationally. The man is worried. He's got a right to be worried. We all should be worried. The cops got men all over the place. The guy tries anything, they're gonna grab him. Before he shoots? Look, why don't we all go out there and do our jobs and let the cops do theirs. You expect Preacher to go out there on that floor? Yeah! Say, Hustler, man, cool it. Ain't nobody twistin' my arm. Yeah, you're a fool, then. Say, man, if Father Celestial wants me, man, he's gonna get me. And it don't matter where, and it don't matter when. So--so, man, let's just go play ball, all right? Let's play ball. Let's get out there. Aren't you worried? The dude ain't aimin' at me. But he knew Preacher was here. How long before the cops know you're here? For running a numbers bank? Hell, they wouldn't go to New Jersey to pick me up. Hey, look, stop worrying. Damn. Doesn't matter. Win or lose, when this game is over, I'm Roberta James again. Yeah. We better catch up. [Cheering] Now, this guy, Swish, he's got no muscle. Now, work on it. And that white guy, Newton, he's a bull. Get him to foul out. There's no bench. How bad do you want us to whip 'em? Raw! Arr! Come on, let's go! Let's go. All: State! State! State! State! Damn. Sounds like a goddamn war down there. Don't worry about them. We'll shoot off our own guns tonight, huh? State! State! State! Now get out there! [Blows whistle] Crowd: State! State! State! Bo: Call it, ref! Call it! Come on, fellas! Size-up there! Let's go! Play some defense for a change, will ya? Hey, don't shoot! No! Time-out! Time-out! [Blows whistle] [Horn] David: What's the matter? Hey, I thought the sucker had a gun. Put your hands up! Put your hands up! Idiots! Defense! Get on defense! That's how to hustle! Cut it out! I'm gonna knock you on your butt. [Blows whistle] Charging foul! 22! David: What? What? What'd he do? Wait a minute. Give me a break. Spread out! In the corner, Sam! Sam, in the corner! [Blows whistle] Charging! 22! [Horn] They'll do better in a minute. I'm sure they will. Or else I'm not gonna pass 'em in English. Man, what's wrong with you? Keep your hands to yourself. What's the matter with you? Keep your hands to yourself. All right, come on! Come on! Fill the lanes! Let's go, out there! Crowd: Hey, hey! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Hey! Go, C.U.! [Cheering] [Whistle] Time-out. Red. [Horn] What the hell's the matter with you guys? What do you want out of us, coach? D.C. and Newton supposed to be the weak players out there, and they're killin' us. Then start puttin' pressure on them, you assholes! Let's go. All: State! [Blows whistle] Foul, 33! 2 shots! [Blowing whistles] Break it up! Break it up! D.C.: Let me go, man! Crowd: Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! [Horn] Sorry, coach. I can't do nothing. It's all right. No problem. All right, gentlemen. I don't have too much to say. We're leading by 4 points. It's been a pretty good first half. I think we got a big psychological advantage going into the second half, so let's take advantage of it. Now, Mr. D.C. Dacey, Acey-Deucy, you gotta control your temper. I'm tellin' you this as a friend, not as a coach, because you're gonna get your ass kicked out of the game. They're comin' down on Swish. I know they're comin' down on Swish, but that's part of the game, and he knows it, too. All right? Lighten up. Hey, I gotta do something to stop that dude beaton. He's killin' me on the boards. Yeah, I was gonna address myself to that problem. Preacher, I'm gonna start Hollis the second half. I want beaton out of the game. Know what I'm askin' you to do? Figured you'd have some idea. David: Stay on the man. Give him a little room. Don't-- All right, come on. This is for all the marbles. [Horn] David: Let's get that tip! Let's get the tip! Turn up that defense! There's your man! Hollis, that's your man! Stay on him! That's it! Now let's keep it moving! Keep it moving, now! Hey, Hustler, where you shootin' from? Stay on your man, Hollis! Stay on your man, Hollis! [Blowing whistles] He fouled my boy! [Horn] Break it up! Break it up! Come on! Get off the court! You all right, Hollis? Bo: Wait a minute. Referee: You're out of the game! Hey, wait a minute. He was provoked. Coach, he used his fist. He's out of the game. Let me see. Get me a towel. Get me a towel. All right. Come on. Walk it off. Come on. We'll get you to the hospital. What'd you say? Called his mother a dirty nigger. Part of the game. A man's jugular vein is not part of any game. It's the same as mine. My nose is just killin' me. Go up the middle. [Whistle] Foul! 2 shots! You were charging! Come on, man. What'd he do? Hey, ref. Aw, come on. That's all right. Say, ref, come on. Krebs. Go in there and do the best you can. Who do I call a nigger, coach? Don't call anybody a nigger. Just check in. Yes, sir. [Horn] You played better tonight than I ever thought you were capable of. I tried, coach. I really tried. You played your best game when it counted. You got nothing to be ashamed of. Yeah, but we could lose. We never lost before. I have. You don't die from it. Good game. Time-out! Time-out! Swish, time-out! [Whistle, horn] Hey, coach, what'd you call time-out for? You're doin' great. Take a break. Take a little rest. You can't believe I told Hollis to do that, right? Forget it, all right? Listen, wait a minute. Wait a minute. It was a shitty thing to do. I apologize. Ok. Ok. It's no problem. Don't look around. Just listen to me. There's a cop here with a warrant for your arrest. He's gonna serve it as soon as the game's over. How do you know that? He told me before the game. Oh. You made a deal with him so I could play ball. Why tell me now? I just thought that you had the right to know. Whatever you do is all right with me. [Horn] Get your hands up on the outside shots, all right? Pass the ball to Hustler. Let's go. Come on. That's more like it. Now start moving that ball. Start moving that ball! All right! All right, set up. Set up! Come on and get movin' down there, will you?! You look like a bunch of idiots! Where's David? See him on the thing by the clock? Put your glasses on so you can see him. He's over there. Get your hands up! Get your hands up! All right! Look how excited he is. Isn't it wonderful? One time. One time, make it happen! Come on, hit it! Go! All the way! One more! Yes! D.C.: My ankle! [Horn] What's the matter? Aah. Sprained it bad, man. Goddamn. Get him to the locker room. You better call a doctor. Nah, nah, it ain't broke. It's--I just need an ice pack. Coach, is it broken? No, it ain't broken. All right, stay between the man and the ball at all times. Don't let him get in front of you! You listening? Don't let him get in front of you! Go ahead. At least there's no swelling. Hey, man, look, I've had this before. Why don't--just give me 5 minutes to rest it. Want me to bandage it? No, Howard! Why don't you go out and watch the game, man? I'll be all right. I hope so. Without you, we haven't got a chance. Hell, we got 'em by 8 points. That'll last 2 minutes. Look, I'm sorry. I just didn't think it would mean this much to me. That's it, baby. That's it. Keep it all going. David: Hands up! Hands up! Watch him, Larry! Watch him! Crowd: Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Go, C.U.! Watch him, Larry. Watch him. Watch the pick! That's it! Bo: That's great! That's great! Ram it right down their throats! Uhh! Uhh. Let's go. Stay with him, Krebs! Get over that screen, Swish! Hustler, help out! Yeah! All right, baby! Get goin' back there! Hey, what do you say, huh? [Muffled protests] Here we go! That's it! Take a shot! There you are! Give it to 'em again! Send them--ha ha ha! Hey, how 'bout that, Greene? How 'bout that, baby? Thataway to go, baby! How 'bout that, Greene? They're goin' now! Keep it goin'! Hey, cheer, will ya, lady?! Let's go! Move it! Move it! Woman: There's D.C.! D.C.! It's D.C. Time-out! Time-out! Time! Time! [Whistle] [Horn] How's your ankle? It's great for basketball, but that's the only kind of running I got a heart for. Say, D.C., how's your ankle, man? It's all right. Hey, Preacher, they got your man. Are you serious? He's in the police car. All right. Hey, let's play ball. Hey, we got 2 minutes and 59 seconds to go. Let's do it! Come on! [Music over audio] Time-out! Time-out, Preacher! All right, Krebs. Pressure free throw. Pressure free throw. Beautiful. Beautiful. All right, I wanna go with C14, all right? Say, Coach, you wanna try that I.U. play? No, no. I wanna go with C14, all right? Now, when you take it-- Ain't got the legs for it, Coach. That's too risky. Know what we need? I know what we need. We need fresh manpower. Or something like that. What do you mean something like--where you goin'? I'll be right back. What do you mean you'll be right back? What does he mean he'll be right back? Let's go! Let's go. All: State! Come on, there's 15 seconds left. I want the shot taken with 5 or 6 seconds to go. Come on, blue! Let's play ball! Hey, they're stalling! They're stalling! It's a technical foul! Everybody goes-- He's a transsexual. He's a goddamn girl. Preacher: What the hell? Are those for real? What you do that for? Come on. Let's play ball. Let's play ball. Yeah. [No audio] Get that ball! Shoot! Shoot! [Horn] Yay! We won! We won! Shit! We're number one! We're number one! Number one! Ma! Ma! David! Let me down. Ma, how you doin'? Did you see it? I saw. I saw. We got here late. Well, how much-- We? Jan? You wait here. I'll be right back. Take your time. Congratulations. Thank you. You played one whale of a ball game. Thanks a lot. Listen, I got a little bad news for you. I'm Officer Wedgewood, and I have to arrest you. Look, it's a first offense, and I'm sure you'll only get probation. Ok. I'm ready. Good man. Now, Carl, excuse me. We can work this all out. Oh, everything's taken care of, Alton. Everything's all right. I got some 100-proof bourbon up there. Come on. Let's talk this whole thing over. I feel rotten. Why? Because I should have been here with you-- No, you should--no. Why should you be as crazy as me? You should see yourself in there. I'm so proud of you. It's obvious this is what-- what you're meant to be. What about my stomach? What about your stomach? My stomach's killing me. Look at this. I've been taking these things all night. You can give me one. David Greene, I am gonna make you a deal. You're gonna make me a deal? I'm gonna make you a deal. What's the deal? You take care of your team, yeah. And I'm gonna take care of your stomach. That's not no. A bad deal. I got another deal. What? Remember when I first met you? I had this red Firebird 450, used to drive around crazy all the time. What if I get Henry to sponsor me and I enter this year's Indy 500? Crowd: We want Greene! We want Greene! They're calling you in there. It's basketball or nothing, huh? Oh, I definitely don't wanna lose you again. All right. Basketball. We want Greene!
