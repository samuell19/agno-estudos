- Well? - Too bad. lt's broken. A poor warrior. - A survivor. - How pitiful. We are both good warriors. Let's go have a drink instead! No. Never. l'll cut you in half! What is it with you two? Can't you get your swords up? You're like birds with clipped wings, rather than men. Get lost! Kill this bastard! l'll reward you! - You're gonna reward us? - Yes! l'll make you rich. - With what? - You won't regret it. Do you want to pay us with sand and stones? You look like a mangy dog! Come on and fight, you weaklings! - Did you find something? - No, just a rifle. - Slowly, but surely... - Come on, let's get lost. Sengoku Rokku Hayate no Onnatachi! (Civil War Rock: Hurricane Girls! ) lf you're shooting at us, at least aim properly. - What do you want? - Who knows? Maybe we want you. What do you mean? Who are you? - Us? - We're men! Men with lots of virility! We don't need you! lf we want men, we take them! You should be more careful! lf you're not, l'll give you something that'll leave you unable to ride for three days! Promises, promises... lf l were to take you up on that, you'd turn tail and run. Are you free tonight? We'll come and see what you're made of. There you are! l didn't think you'd actually come. The only thing you want from us are weapons, right? That's not enough. What am l supposed to do with one or two rifles? Well, come on and sit down! There's plenty of everything. Food, drink and studs! - Eno! - Get your legs out of the way! Eno, wait! - Let me go! - Why should l? Why are you running away? l know you love me. l don't love you, Taro. lt's impossible to love a man like you. We'll see about that. Get naked! l'm not somebody who likes to wait. You like to take everything by force, right? Naturally. Everything l can't get without it... l know you love me, Eno, and you'll obey me! Eno? Yesterday, a stranger visited me. He told me something very interesting. Something of vital importance. Three days ago, a whole company left from Kichu. What are they carrying? - 120 rifles. - Too many for you. What do you want with so many rifles? To fight. l will have lots of men, and become a powerful man. - And? - Well... - what else could a man want? - There is something. Right. l almost forgot. Eno... - l want you to become my bride. - No way. What are you doing? Oh, it's you. Well, how are things? There are about 20 men. They plan to take shelter at a temple tonight. A good place to die. Ride back to the camp... - but don't celebrate our victory yet. - OK. Well, there's got to be something left for us. lf not, we'll have to get unpleasant! One has to fight for one's rights. You honeys look like you're in need of some men. Come on! Lose the clothes! What are you waiting for? Wasn't Taro with you guys? lsn't he with you? Guess you've waited for nothing. You'll have plenty of fun with me, or my friend here. Don't waste your time thinking about Taro. Enough talk! Let's have some fun! Surrender and l'll let you live. They're trying to flee! You'll go right to hell! Hurry and say one last prayer. You'll go to hell, too! Those pigs! They tricked us! - Taroku, go! - Alright. - lt's Pairu. - Halt, halt, halt! - He has an arrow in his back. - What happened? - Who did this? - Pairu, talk! - Pairu, talk! - We'll take you away from here! They were too many for us. - How could this happen? - We walked right into an ambush. There were 40, 50, or more. They slaughtered us like cattle! - And our men? - l don't know... l think l'm the only one who got out alive. Here, drink. Careful, guys. The water is poisoned. - We're screwed! - Who did this? lt worked! lt was the juice of the root that we put into the water. lt would have killed ten bears. lf you were real priests, you'd have an antidote against this. Come on, attack! - We'll take our time. - That's why we're feared everywhere. Because we're gorgeous and cruel. - So you want to kill us? - Yes. We'll cut open your stomachs. Stop it! Stop! - Come on. - Do you want to let me die? l want to play like a child! And l want a man. A real man! You'll get one sooner than you think. - Come on, let's ride into town. - Yeah! Wake up! ''The rifles you were looking for do exist. Some priests had them, ''but they weren't really priests. ''Wait for me, Taro. We still have such nice things to experience together.'' This is a letter from Eno. Looks like the wildcats made a catch. Tell me one thing: do you love me or hate me? You no longer need me, Taro. What do you want from me? Please let me go. You're not going. There are nights when l want you. You'll have to get used to it. Don't touch me! - They're huge! - Three times the size of normal men. Come on. Listen! You can do whatever you want for now. We'll meet again tomorrow morning, at six. Eno? Are you buying me sweets? - You're looking great. - This stuff drives me crazy. When l got your letter, l knew exactly where to find you. You were right. Yeah that's what they say, even if it sounds funny. - Did you understand what he meant? - No, you? Well, he wants to bang you! Why doesn't he say so? So dirty at your age? What do you mean, ''dirty''? You never get too old for sex. You can get back up. l heard you have lots of treasure around here. Excuse me, but l have no idea what you consider treasure. Treasure from foreign lands. No, no, you're mistaken. l own nothing of that sort. Whatever. Don't talk, show us the back rooms. My dear friend, l think you can do me a favor. - What would that be? - l wish to borrow this bed. - Did you hear those bells? - Yes, those devilish bitches had them, too. Up Just you wait! This time l'll win for sure. No! lt blinds my eyes! - Hurry up and play, old man. - Quiet, young man! Hurry up. lf you lose, you have to undress. Shut your trap. l won't lose. And, if l do, l promise you will have your fun with it. So go ahead and throw! Please open up, sister. Will you forgive me? So that's how it is... The man you loved has been killed? lt's your fate to mourn. You should become a nun, like me. Only this can help you, and bring you enlightenment. l can't stay here. l have sinned, and have to bid you farewell. You too! Come on, show me! You're a cheater. Now we'll show you what we consider ''love''. Come, off with the silly stuff! Seems like you like it rough! Just wait, we ain't got started yet. - You have a little less down there than we had hoped for. - But we can perform some special tricks with it! Have you gone crazy? What are you doing? You're tearing it. No way, this is all for me?! You Europeans are difficult to undress! Who are you? What exactly do you want from me? You're gonna tell us where the rifles are. What rifles? l have no idea what you're talking about. - l guess you have me confused with... - Don't lie to me. This bell betrayed you. l already heard it once before... l'll never forget that day. So, talk! l told you to open your cock-sucking hole! l'm warning you - there are limits to my patience! - l like that smell. - Eno... tell me what's going on with the rifles. - There are 120. - And? We took them. You're kidding! Say that again. lf you want, you can have them tomorrow. - How high is the price? - The price? What do you want for them? Gold? Silver? You fool! You don't know me. l'd never have done it for pay. - Alright, why then? - Just for fun. So l can give them to you. You look great in that dress. Why are you taking it off? lt's from you, and that's why l spit on it! ait You'll get your rifles. Listen: if you don't talk, you'll die. You won't be able to take this forever, so be reasonable and talk. l... don't know... anything. hen die ait - Hurry, Koruka is here! - Alright, we're coming. lt's you... The Lord isn't pleased with how you carry out his orders. lt was just a series of unfortunate events. Tell the Lord that l'll perform harakiri after finding the weapons. l will tell him. From now on, you're under my orders. We'll try to find the rifles together. So, come. Get up! - How long has she been hanging like that? - We had to do it. She wouldn't talk, so we had to take extreme measures. You won't make her talk with torture. Just look at her - you have to be tender with her. That will break her will. No, cruelty won't make her talk... You should have known that. My dear, now tell me who stole the rifles? Wake up. lt's cold here. What is this thing l'm wearing? - Where are you off to? - Hands off! Come on, let's get lost. Let us out of here! - What else do you want? You already had everything - lsn't that enough? - lt's goddamn cold! - lt's your own fault. Look at yourselves... Where have you been? - Do you know where Nene is? - No. - l'm so fucking cold! - Yeah, it's cold. Let's go, we can't wait any longer. The way Nene is, she's probably hugging some guy right now. Where have you two been all night? l'm sure you'd love to know. There's no way l'm telling. Look! Somebody was there! You saw it too, right? We're going. l really need to hit the sack with an exciting man! lt's already morning. Let me go. Please let me go. Where do you want to go? l have to get away from here. You have to let me go. Thank you for the present. l'll remember this. Then start thinking about how you can show your gratitude. - Are a powerful Lord now, Taro? - Yes. Eno! Here, take this and remember me. And now, come! Nene Drop your sword. We don't want to kill you. Not a chance! - Taroku, follow her. - Yes. - Who was that? - The arrow came from there. Watch out! Careful! Stay calm. lf you're reasonable, nothing bad will happen. Come, up here. Faster! Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry! p us They killed Nene. Those fucking pigs! - Where are we riding to? - l don't know. - Where? - Tena Valley. - We'll be safest there. - No, impossible. lf they catch us there, they will also find the rifles. We have to find some other place to hide. You were talking about Tena Valley. Where is that? Maybe you'll even take me there... l'd rather die. l have a trick that has never failed to make women talk... So, where is that valley? Open your mouth already! You will tell me! Trust me, you will. How long do you think you can keep lying to us? - Tell me where the rifles are! - Like hell l will! You're a coward, and l don't talk to cowards. You'll never find the rifles! Shut up! Talk! Otherwise these wolves will tear you limb from limb. No! l won't say a thing, even if you kill me. Fine, if that's what you want... it can be arranged. Where is Takura? Watch out! Those bastards are probably waiting for us. - Of course they are. - Please don't go. - Takura and Nene are dead. - We don't know for sure. We have to try. l know that. - The wildcats... - Right. - You are the pig who... - Who is your leader? That's the guy. He and his people attacked our company. Put your swords away! l have a lot more. Maybe we can make a deal - think about it. Why did you act like you wanted to sell the rifles? Acted like it? What do you mean? l really want to sell them. Why? You always said you wanted to fight, and rule the land. What kind of sense would that make? The only thing you'd achieve that way is to lose your life. Do you think the same way? What can l say? lf he says so, then it'll probably be right. - And you? - You know, l won't get dragged into this. l thought you were doing everything differently. You are just; you can help many people. Help who? The peasants, maybe? A room with foreign furniture... including a sparkling bath to wash in every day. Whose body would you want to wash? Mine, only mine. - Taro? - Come in. Hiro disappeared with his horse, and all the rifles. What did you say? You wait here. l'll get him myself. Hiro, stop! Stop, l said! Hiro, do you want me to kill you? Stop and l'll forget this whole thing. Goddamn naive bastard! l don't want to shoot you. Come, eat. Nene used to eat from this bowl. Stop crying - it won't bring her back. lt was Taro. They had a fight. - Taro? - Yes, because he wants to sell the rifles. Has he gone crazy? To whom, and when? They want to pay him tomorrow at Bogohara. Bogohara. Let us pass! Eno? l wanted to call for you today. hy's that? One, two, three, four. l win. l'm sorry. Pairu is trying to betray me. He escaped with the rifles. Where's he off to? l have no idea. My men are chasing him. Without those rifles, l won't be able to reach my goal. The scent of this water disappears with time. l'm sorry. - Don't you want to take off your armor? - For you, anytime. Yeah, touch me there. l like that. Help me. Take your time. Don't be so impatient. There's something left. Where are you off to? l'll be back soon... and then we'll have reason to celebrate. Quiet, and nothing will happen to you. l'm not your enemy. l want to help you. But if l help you now, you'll have to take me with you. Take me to any town. Will you do that for me? Why not? l want to help you. This is a present from us. Taro will be happy. You can pass. ls this supposed to be a bad joke? - He cheated us. - He won't get away with this. You'll pay dearly for this! - The score has been settled. - And the rifles, where are they? - The wildcats found Pairo. - That means... - ... they're now headed for... - Shin-den! Here We have to rest. There's no way he can last much longer. The hut over there. Careful. Slowly. Tsuzumi! Wake up. Get up, hurry. What should we do? We can't wait until they get here. Eno, we'll meet at the river's source. Shino, you come with me. Careful! Let's get out of here! Taro! Move! lsn't Shino back yet? These goddamn rifles! l hate these things - they've brought us only bad luck. They killed Shino. Taro, why are you chasing after the rifles? And why are you, my friend? My Lord wants them. l see. l'm after them so you won't get them. - Why are you running away from me? - Why are you chasing me? - Because you're running. - Because you're chasing! - Give back the rifles. - Not a chance. - Why not? - l'll fight! - Alright, and then? - Then maybe l'll be powerful. - And? - l will rule the land. - And? - Yeah, what else... l will spray scented water everywhere. Don't laugh! A scent l like! Paradise ahead. Behind us, hell. These words were written on the headgear. l've been beaten. Beaten and soulsick, l withdraw. - How could l ever follow... - You can! l know you can. They are waiting for you. They are waiting for your return. l... l wanted you. l wanted to take you with me... To Shin... l wanted to take you with me... On the back of my horse. l wanted to take you with me... To Shin-den... Stop crying. Come on, stop. Stop crying. Stop crying. Stop crying. - Pairo, don't die! - Pairo! What now? Should we go to Shin-den? lt's no longer important - he won't see it. Translated by Kemushi Revised by Lord Retsudo
