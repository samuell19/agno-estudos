You wouldn't happen to know where the AT picks up around here. Would you? Um. Ma'am. Hey. You through, hikers? Oh, yes, yes, ma'am. We've been out here for, - uh, like eighteen days... - Eighteen or nineteen, yeah. How's it been? HIKER 2: Oh, it's been good. It's been real good. We got lost like three or four times, I don't know. - [CHUCKLES] - Maybe four or five. [CHUCKLES] Maybe that, maybe that. Um... Well, again, sorry to walk up on you. Uh, if you could just point us in the right direction. You boys hungry? You get many hikers this way? Just the ones that can't read maps. So, do you live out here? I do. Well, we do. You and... My husband. No. Stop! You hear me? I said stop! Right there. You stop right there. Did you hear me? Adam. Adam, I said stop. Right there, please. Darling. - Adam, you stop right there. - Is that a gun? - Listen to me. No. - Get down. ADAM: How did you find this place? - We, no... - Who told you about us? - We didn't... - We just took a wrong turn. - We're looking for the trail. - Adam, please, darling. - Get up. - Okay. Walk. Get up! Okay, okay. - Adam, listen to me. - ADAM: Move. - HIKER 1: Okay. Okay. - Get 'em off. ADAM: Get 'em off! - Get in. - ELLA: Adam, darling. Please. Pull them bandanas down. [ADAM PANTING] [COUGHING] LILY: Hey! Do you know how to get to the hiker's lodge? MAN: The lodge is a few miles down the trail. LILY: Yeah, I know. Got it. - MAN: All right. Be careful. - LILY: Thanks. [COUGHS] [GROANS] [RETCHING] [COUGHING] [HACKING] [HACKING CONTINUES] - [GASPS] - [GLASS SHATTERING] LILY: Oh, no, don't worry about it. It was my fault. I didn't mean to startle you. No, I... Really, it's okay. How are you feeling? I'm... I'm better. [ADAM SHOUTING] Ella? [WHISPERING] Excuse me. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] How does dinner sound? You must still be weak. I insist. - I don't know, I think... - I could draw you a bath and you could get a head start in the morning. Okay. I hope the water suits you. We'll be working on the other side of the barn. The whole place is ours, so... I think you'll find it quite private. [WATER SPLASHING] [WHIMPERING] Shit. [CRYING] [COUGHING] ELLA: Adam. Adam, darling, would you like to say grace? Adam, the grace. [SIGHS] Thank you, Lord for this food. Amen. Amen. I apologize. - My cooking is not... - It's okay, um, I've had worse. That dress, it fits you. Oh, thank you. Yeah. It's nice. - How did you find us? - Adam. Well, I was walking in the woods and I got lost. I was hiking. Know your way back? Um, no. Like I said, I was lost. So... Be ready tomorrow. We leave first thing. ELLA: I'm gonna let you eat your meal in peace. Mm-hmm. ELLA: I'm sorry. We don't get many visitors these days. I kind of figured that. So are you just, like, off the grid or something? I mean, you have no power, no water and... You're, like, an Amish. Oh. Oh, no. Not quite. But it's just the two of you out here. Truth is it's been nice having company. I should turn in. You stay out here as long as you like. It's such a pleasant evening. Just know my husband will be ready to leave at dawn. ADAM: You smiled. What of it? Just been a while, is all. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [HACKING] [HACKING CONTINUES] LILY: I, uh... I overslept. [COUGHS] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, I just... You tryin' to leave? What? You tryin' to leave? Well, you said that, uh... I know what I said, now I'm asking you. You tryin' to leave or not? ADAM: You can stay till week's end. [CHOPPING] - [WOOD BREAKING] - GIRL: Ah! [GRUNTS] Ah, shit! [WINCES] ADAM: Let me see 'em. You're done for the day. No, I'm fine. I can still... ADAM: I said you're done. You've earned your keep. Head on inside. - I'm fine, really. I mean... - ADAM: Get. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Here you are. How's that feel? It's, uh... It's better. Thank you. You going back out there? Uh, well, no. He said that I'm done for the day. He must be takin' to you, then. I wouldn't say that. He hasn't run you off with a shotgun yet. It means he must have taken to you. [COUGHING] ADAM: Hey! Right here. You, uh... What are you makin'? ADAM: This corn feed here. Heated up water, yeast, add some mash. Steam runs through this pipe here into the thumping keg. Thump, thump. Mash falls to the bottom. Got it? This creek, secret to the whole damn thing. Vapor worms its way through here, river water cools it down, until... Shit'll knock you on your ass. [COUGHS] You're, uh... You're making moonshine. Best in Appalachia. [LILY COOING] LILY: I noticed that. I reckon we may need some more. Need to see the tree, anyhow. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Oh, you know, I guess it makes sense now. What? You know, you just... You have no one out here to tell you what to do, or... You know, you can just kinda do whatever you want. Yeah. I guess it is something, now you mentioned it, but... I sometimes forget. Mmm. - Oh, my God. - [BOTH LAUGH] So what's your story, then? What do you mean? ELLA: You hiking on your own? Yeah. ELLA: No boyfriend or anything? Mm-mmm, no. No, no, nothing like that. - ELLA: Family? - [SIGHS] Not really. No one's gonna come find you? I don't really want them to find me. Well... I guess you came to the right place then. - [BOTH LAUGH] - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just a little sore. Yeah, well, chopping wood's not easy if you ain't used to it. Come here. Here. Here? - How's that feel? - Oh. It hurts, but it's good. - ELLA: Too hard? - No, no, not at all. [MOANS] Just close your eyes, Lily. There you are. Ooh. Thank you. That was very wonderful. [CHUCKLES] Oh, shit. Adam. Adam, I'm... Shit, I'm sorry, um... [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] ADAM: Well... [ADAM PANTING] [EXHALES] Won't you come and sit? Those two are mine. The ones with the crosses. They were stillborn, the both of them. We haven't been together, since all of that. First, I thought that is what I had been missing, but after last night, all I could think was there's more to it. I don't... More to what? At first, I didn't know why you showed up here. I thought maybe you were a test. ELLA: You needed to show us something, teach us. But after last night, I realized, you're here for something else. LILY: [COUGHS] Hey. Ella, can't we just wait a sec? Come on, we're here. You want me to go in there? [PANTING] We both are. Uh... [COUGHS] I don't know about that. You wanted answers, right? I'm trying to give them to you. Well, this doesn't make any sense. You're running away, aren't you? You don't know what the hell you're talking about. But we both know you can't run from this. Where'd you get that? This ain't gonna fix you. Did you go through my stuff? This is not a cure. What the hell is wrong with you? How dare you... Listen to me! I am trying to help you, if you will let me. Take off your bandages. Go on, take 'em off. Oh, it's... ELLA: You see? It's what I've been trying to tell you. - We gotta get you inside that cave. - ADAM: Ella! No. No! Adam, calm down. ELLA: Listen to me. Lower that gun, Adam. Why you bring her here? ELLA: Lower that gun, Adam. Why the hell you bring her here? Ella, you best start talkin'. ADAM: I said, start talkin'. All right. [SOFTLY] All right. I didn't want you to hear it like this. This is not how it was supposed to go. ELLA: But I want out. [SIGHS] I want out. What do you mean? I mean, I ain't happy. I ain't been happy for a long time, man. I ain't happy and I want out. You ain't happy, we'll fix it. - We can't fix this. - Why can't we can't? [SIGHS] We did the time. Adam, we both did. But we made vows. [SNIFFLES] Vows weren't meant for this. What we're doing, this ain't natural. You know that. What are you talking about? Vows are forever. Ain't nothing forever. How can you say that? How do you explain this then? How do you explain all this? How do you explain her? She ain't got nothing to do with it. She's here for a reason, Adam, she's a sign. She was sent here for us, she was sent here for you. She got lost like all the others. She was sent here so you could save her. She was sent here to be with you. No, no, no. No, you are my wife. You are my wife! She was sent here so I could leave. But you love me. ADAM: Say it. Say you love me. Say it, God damn it! [PANTING] I'm sorry. No. [COUGHING] ADAM: You watch what you did. You did that. You watch what you did. [ELLA GRUNTS] You watch her. - You watch what you did. - [BREATHING HEAVILY] - Watch what you did. - [ELLA CRYING] [DOG BARKING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] ADAM: Come on. We gotta turn back. ELLA: Well, we both know... [GUNSHOT] [PANTING] ADAM: Don't you quit me now. ELLA: Get out of here. You're hurting me. Just wait until Shelby's men find us. [EXCLAIMS IN PAIN] I thought we could get away. - [GUNSHOT] - Come on. Come on. [PANTING] Get in. [DOG CONTINUES BARKING] Take this. I'll keep watch. Go on, get. Go sit yourself down. Ella. Wake up. It's morning. We should make a run for it. Oh. What was I thinking? Trusting you. I never should have done it. And now what? We missed the damn train. The truck's shot up. Even if we do make it out of here, Shelby's got eyes for a hundred miles. Do you even got the damn money? Adam? Adam? What is this? Adam? Hey. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. [BOTH PANTING] Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Help! Hello? Hello? [ADAM SCREAMING IN AGONY] [SCREAMING IN PAIN] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] - What's that? - The deed. Thomas and Mary Bragg. It was just hanging up. No safe, no lock. What of it? They ain't coming back. Like hell, they ain't. They shot the dog in the shed. They planned it. Why? We're here now and I have the deed. Planning on stealing their name? I could be a Mary. I guess that makes me Thomas. No. No, it's my place. Not yours. I gotta claim just as you. You'd be dead without me. And you'd still be living under Daniel Shelby. That deal is square. I paid you the money. It's your own damn fault for losing it. I'll let you stay for a while until those wounds are healed. Then I expect you to be on your way. [CHUCKLING] What? What you laughin' at? You know how to farm, do you? - It's like your cooking. - I'll get by. And money? I'll get by. And if your daddy shows up to take you back, how are you gettin' by then? I said I'll get by. Suit yourself. Miss Bragg. [CREAKS] [GROANING] Get off me, woman. You're a damn fool, you know? - I'm fine. - You are not fine. I said quit it, I don't need your pity. [GASPS] Now, I know you're torn up about this place. Can't take gettin' the one-up by a woman, can you? Living under a woman's roof? But you listen to me and you listen straight. If you think this is pity, you got another thing comin'. I didn't run halfway across the state for you to lead Shelby and his men right back to me. [PANTS] I ain't getting caught. I ain't no snitch. But you're a right fool. Dumb as they come. Now, you can sleep in the shed for all I care. But you ain't leaving a trail in the woods for the hounds to follow. You try and leave again before those wounds are closed, I'll put you in the ground myself. Or, you can hobble your ass back inside and actually make yourself useful. Ain't no way I can build a still by myself. [PANTING] [GROANS] [EXHALES] [SOFT GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING] ADAM: I'll admit, I never expected you to take up your daddy's work. ELLA: Stepdaddy. We need supplies, don't we? We'd never last the winter without them. ADAM: You want to sell hooch right under his nose? ELLA: Of course not. We'll trade it. Barter it. We'll stay low that way. Shelby hides behind these. You don't know him like I do. He ain't never going to stop looking for me. ADAM: That's the best moonshine for a thousand miles. ELLA: I know, that's a fact. Two bottles. As in right now. He didn't find us. I ain't planning on changing it. [HAMMERING] ADAM: What did he do to you? I've done all they were saying and never asked a single question. And you will never ask me again. ADAM: I'll kill that man for you. I swear it. [GLASSES CLINKING] [BOTH LAUGHING] Well, who would've thought? Not me. I thought you were always just a big dumb mule. I thought you were nothing but a pair of chicken legs. Well... You're still a mule and a chicken escaping the wolf. - [GLASSES CLINKING] - [GROANS] - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Let me check to make sure you're all right. - I said I'm fine. - Let me change those dressings, anyway. - I'm fine. You're right. It's probably fine. ADAM: Not like I said. I should probably turn in. Mm-hmm. Good night. Good night. ELLA: Adam! [DOOR OPENS] [PANTING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] SHELBY: Hello. I know someone's in there. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] I'm looking for my daughter, Ella Shelby. Go on in there. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Ella, you in there? [KNOCKING CONTINUES] You go in now. You go and get that damn door open. [THUDDING] MAN: Boss, she's out back. I can see her. You make sure you don't hurt her now. She goes unharmed. Stop right there. MAN: Ella, don't you run. Don't you run. Boss! Boss! - I got her out by the... - [GUNSHOT] - Come on! - Adam. Now, get in. Stay quiet, I'll be back. You're leaving? It's time for you to trust me. [PANTING] [GUNSHOTS] ADAM: Ella. Ella. I got the other one. Shelby ran off. I ain't see him. Come on. [GUNSHOT] [PANTING] Thank you, my dear God. [GUN COCKING] You come one step closer. Can't tell you how many times I prayed for today. For this moment. We all have. Stay back. Just this last weekend, Pastor Willett lead a beautiful sermon. There wasn't a dry eye in the whole chapel, not nowhere in the congregation. I said stay back. Saw that still down there by the stream. You build that? I'm a proud man. I'm a proud father. You ain't no father of mine! Don't you say that. Don't you say those words. You may not be from my seed, but I ain't any lesser father to you than the good Father above us all. Now it is time, sweet Ella, - for you to return. - No. Enough sin has been cast. Enough blood has been shed, and forgiven in Jesus' name. [SOBBING] No. [SNIFFLES] No, please just let me go. I am here to cleanse you in the Holy Spirit. Just let me leave, please. To forgive you, your transgressions. - Please, just let me leave. - You will repent! Do you hear me! Let me hear you say it with your mouth, - repent... - [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] [GUNSHOT] ADAM: Hey there, chicken legs. Hey, mule. [SIGHS] You gonna patch me up again? I don't think I can this time. I'm sorry. Okay. You lay still now. You got any water? In the cave. There's water in the cave. [SOBBING] [PANTING] [SIGHS] [PANTING] Come on, Lily. Drink this. Come on. Drink it. Drink it. Come on. [COUGHING] That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. She's still out. What are you doing? You wanna carry her by yourself? Just drop me off with her then and I'll figure it out from there. Adam. Adam. [CRYING] [CAR STARTING] [SOBBING] [FIRE CRACKLING] [BOTTLE SHATTERING] - Where is he? - He's not here. - Where is he? - He's not here. You're safe. He's not here. It's just us two. - Let me get out of here. - Lily, you're safe. Lily, you're safe. Stay here. We'll stay the night. I will leave at the next stop and you'll never see me again. You're safe. You're safe, darling. Lily, he's not here. [WHISPERING] He's not here. You're safe, darling. He... He shot me. He shot me. How am I... [BREATHING HEAVILY] This is what I wanted to show you at the cave. This is how. Okay. But it just tastes like water. ELLA: I know. I don't understand any of this. Am I cured? Lily, darling, you got so much worse really. Maybe if you kept drinking the water, it could stave it off. [WHIMPERING] - [SNIFFLES] I'm so sorry. - [SOBBING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ALL LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: Hey, you wanna join us? We got a beer with your name on it. No, thank you. MAN: Oh, come on, looks like you could use a little trail magic. Um... Thank you. But I'm fine, really. MAN: She said this was the end of the road for you. You just gonna hitch it back into town? I'll make you a deal. Come on over, have a drink. You could stay the night in the hostel, and if you still feel the same way tomorrow morning, I'll take you back into town myself. Come on. Okay. Yep. Yeah? Yeah, I'll take that... I got you. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] And um... Just meet me at the bar. All right. [THUDS] Ella? Ella? Ella? [PANTING] - How's she doing back there? - LILY: I, uh, I don't know. - How much longer? - Maybe, like, five miles. The clinic's at the edge of town. Well, dude, we need a fucking hospital. - That's like an hour away. - She's not gonna make that. MAN: What the fuck is wrong with her? Just pinch her nose, tilt her head back or something. She's right out here. FEMALE NURSE: Come on, let's get her up. Gently. MAN: Let's go, come on. Hey. FEMALE NURSE: Just sit her on the edge of the table, put her on her back gently. [ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Doctors. FEMALE NURSE: Step back, please. We were hiking, and we went to the outpost and she started bleeding, she just collapsed. - [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] - Shit. Get them out of here. MAN: Is she okay? We will come and get you. Now! MALE NURSE: Hurry up. Come on. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [DOOR CLOSES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - Cheers to it. - No, no. No, go for it. One more time. [LAUGHING] [ALL LAUGHING] Ready? You ready? - Okay... - [LAUGHING] Ow! [LAUGHING] LILY: Jesus, dude. [ALL LAUGHING] [BARREL CLANGING] [GRUNTING] Get up. MAN: Get it. Hey, - what the hell happened? - No, he did it. It was an accident. - Lay off, bro. - Well, you shouldn't have been touching it in the first place. It's fine, we'll fix it. -I slipped. Don't push me. [BOTH ARGUING] Hey, stop it. My fault? Get up, get up. - MAN: Get... - [BOTH GRUNTING] MAN: Fine, stay down. - Stay down. - [GRUNTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] MAN: Wait, what? Wait! Wait!
