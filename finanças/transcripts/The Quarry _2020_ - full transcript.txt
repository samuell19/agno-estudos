Jesus. Can you leave the pitcher, please? My name is David Martin, I come from Ohio. Not originally, of course. Where are you going? Down toward El Golfo de Mexico, some little town I've never heard of. Plenty of those in Texas. - How far? - A few hours. And you? You are headed? South. On foot? No food? No water? Where did you start from? You ask a lot of questions. Your friend's a real charmer. God is funny. To bring you to me. I don't understand. Only a few miles left, I think. I need to dry out a bit. Let me dry out. I saw a helicopter this morning. Yeah? Uh-huh. A police helicopter. Maybe they were looking for somebody. Who knows? That was a long way back. You can talk to me. I know it's difficult. It's not easy, confession. Let me show you. I'm an alcoholic. That's no secret. Okay. Okay. Entonces... I loved a woman and she loved me... but she had a husband, a family... and I am a religious man. I never told that to anyone. A new life awaits me where I'm going. And it can be the same for you right here, right now. There's power in confession. I don't believe in your religion. Religion has nothing to do with it. Whatever you've done... they'll find you. I'll have to tell them... when I get to town, you know. You'd do the same if you were me. Don't come any closer. I want you to give yourself to God, unburden your soul... Don't you come any fucking closer. And no bars can hold you. Do you hear me? - Shut your mouth. - You will forever be free because whatever you've done he already knows. Shut your fucking... A new life awaits me where I'm going. It can be the same for you. What? You're lost. I'm looking for the church. That way, padre. Celia? Habla Español? No. Jesus. This way. This is yours. I hope it's okay. It's fine. Do you have a suitcase or something? In the van. You should get it. It's not safe here at night. I just wanna sleep. Okay. Just don't forget your suitcase. I told you. I'll call the chief. Chief? Yeah, he's the one in charge. All right. My turn. How you give a redneck a circumcision? How? Kick his sister in the jaw. I'm, uh, looking for the chief. You found him. My van was broken into last night. Took everything I had. You just passing through, I guess? I'm here to work, actually. At the church. Start from the beginning. Well, there's nothing much to tell. I drove in late, parked in front of the church, found where I'm staying, and then fell asleep. By yourself? Did I sleep by myself? I don't care who you sleep with, Reverend, I'm asking if you're traveling alone. Yeah. Did you see anybody on the way in or anybody see you? Well, there was a boy, Mexican. Hmm. We got a lot of those. But young, and... and alone. Late. Holding a tennis ball. This kid, he about 12 years old? And he had an older guy with him about 20, rough looking dude, tattoo of some chick on his arm? I heard a voice, but I didn't see anyone. Lurking in the shadows, probably waiting for a buyer. So you know him? I know everybody. Except you, I guess. Where are you from, Reverend? Originally, where did you grow up? Oh... Ohio. Oh, yeah. You ever live in a town like this? A small town? People think they got charm, you know. Everybody knows everybody. One bar, one grocery, one pizza joint. The judge and the preacher, they share the same building, that kind of stuff. People think it's quaint. Maybe it was. Town like this, tight-knit, safe and quiet, whistle-stop. Until they build the highway a few miles off, pull all the commerce away and all the nice quiet folks along with it. What's left? Yeah. All I'm saying is this ain't Ohio. Now we're here to help you, but you can help yourself an awful lot just by paying a little attention, okay? Okay. You should have Celia look at that hand. So, you know her, too? Like I said. What's the plate number? Reverend? - What? - The plate number of the van? Oh, I don't know. Would somebody get that, please? Well, read this through, sign it at that bottom. I'll have my boys get on it. Just don't expect a miracle. Hello, Bevel Police. Yeah, this is the chief. No. It's always on Sunday. Except when it's on Tuesday. I don't know. I don't make the schedule. Poco, no. It's blood. Why is there blood? Who knows? Fuckin' white dudes. This shit is worth nothing. - Valentin, hey. - Hm? It's like the flowers. At the quarry. Purple flowers are everywhere. Not like these. Do you think he was there? Stop messing around. Let's go tend our crop. Get the bag! Valentin, are you in there? I don't like going to the quarry. You like eating, don't you? I get scared. Stay on top then. Okay, hurry up! Hurry up, Valentin! Chill out, Poco! You should stay... just once. It'll be nice. I'll fix your breakfast in the morning. I got to work. In the middle of the night? That's when the bugs come out. Come on, John. Stay. Don't beg. It makes you look weak. I didn't mean that. It's fine. He knows you're here. The walls are thin. You think he'll stay longer than the last one? I don't really care how long he stays. I like your flowers. They're fake. See you. Not many come. Some but... Hello? Hope you're not expecting an answer. I couldn't help it. So, you got your first service. You got your work cut out for you, huh? Well, I wanted you to know I think I found your man... or your boys, I guess. With your case, your van. I'll be making an arrest soon. Who is it? I think you know who it is. What? You act like it's my fault you come from criminals? They're her cousins. She's sensitive. I should get ready for tonight. Do I know you? Well, what do you mean? Have we met somewhere before you come here? Where would we have met? I don't know. That's why I'm asking. I just feel like I've seen you before. You spend much time in Ohio, Chief? Have a good service, Reverend. That is if anybody shows up. Here's a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance. "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief." Chief. I will read from the book of 1st Timothy Chapter One. "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that He considered me faithful, appointing me to His service. Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance." Do you understand me? English? What would you like to know? Um, who are you? I am a sinner. Why are you here? Because the grace of our Lord was poured out on me. I opened a bottle of wine. I hope you don't mind. He's not married. I mean, he was but his wife died a few years ago. It's none of my business. I've known a few preachers in my day. You're not like any of them. You mean I'm not Mexican? Besides that. Well, I wasn't raised in the church. So, they haven't worn you down yet? I came from Mexico with my uncle when I was a teenager to help him with the church. I have been here ever since. That's a long time. Yes, it is. Poco... The minister. - No. No! - What? What? It's a stupid robe. Where are the bloody clothes? The bloody clothes? The bloody clothes from the van. I don't know. You threw them across the house, dummy. Go get them. We have to burn them. Hurry, let's go! Let's go, let's go! Run, Valentin. Garcia, you get Poco. He went over there. - Hey, stop! - Come here, boy. Get up here. Get up. Get down. I'm too damn old to be chasing you around the woods like a fucking teenager, boy. Give me a break. All right, you go search the trailer. I'm gonna take this little dipshit down to the station. Come on. Garcia! He got away! Put out the damn fire then! Run, Poco! Never stop running! Oh, shit. I will rise and go to Jesus He will take me in His arms In the arms of my dear Savior O, there are ten-thousand charms Yeah? I can't sleep. I heard you singing. You're lonely. Like all the others. That's not why I came. I came to apologize. I didn't mean to cause trouble. Your cousins. Look, if they stole your property, they must be held accountable. Are you close to them? No. But the song that you're singing, is it, uh, was it like a Mexican hymn? My uncle wouldn't let us sing Mexican hymns, just American. To fit in, you know? But none of us spoke much English so we just sang the words in Spanish. That's why none of them rhyme. Well, it sounded nice. I should let you rest. You're really not like the others. I have a lot of hate in my heart, Reverend. I'm not proud of it. Do you, um... do you need to be forgiven? You're not the one who can forgive. Good night. Is this yours, Reverend? Yeah. Well, put some clothes on and come with me. Give me a cigarette, Chief. Oh, you know me. I don't smoke, cabrón. The night you got to town, the boy you saw, this is his brother. Blanco! This a-hole uses a pre-teen to push his dope. Can you believe that? Anyhow, just thought you'd want to see. Well, theft is one thing, Valentin. Destroying evidence is another. Of course, if I were you, I would've started with this. Whose blood is that? Tell me it's yours. Please don't say it belongs to some pothead that pissed you off. It's his. Who? - No shit? - It's true. Yeah, we found these clothes in your trailer, dickhead, and not in his boxes. Now, here's how I see it. I think somebody stepped to you when you were robbing that van and shit got out of hand. That tells me we got a victim somewhere. Either dead or extremely fucking injured. Am I right? Hmm. That's what I thought. Come on. A lot of purple flowers. Why were you at the quarry? Sorry, there ain't more. They burned the rest before we found them. You just sign this here and you can take what's left. No luck on the tires, sorry. But there's an auto store out on the highway. I can't afford new tires. Not getting rich off of the collection plate, huh? Maybe you should watch some TV preachers, get some tips. You're not a big smiler, are you? That's cool. What happens now? Him? He'll stay here until the next circuit court. We do one of those in the church every couple of months. We'll find his brother in the meantime. It's just some clothes to me. Just stuff. It's no big deal, really. Breaking the law ain't a big deal? I just don't think it's worth the trouble, that's all. Look, I know what you're doing. Turn the other cheek, second chances, forgiveness. I get it. But here's the problem, Reverend. Forgiveness only works in a world where people learn their lessons. But they don't, not here anyway. Thank you for finding my stuff. Blanco. "But now a righteousness from God, which is apart from law, has been made known." "This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe." "There is no difference." "So we are made right with God through faith in Jesus." "Not by obeying the law." We have not been spoken to the way that you speak to us, without judgement. I just say the words. It's not me that you are here for. It's the words. It's the book. I... I don't know what I say. I give myself to you, Lord. Because I am hopeless. And because I have failed. I am the dirt. I am lower than low. I am beyond hope in the eyes of man. Rosario has something she would like to ask you, Reverend. She wants to be baptized. It's funny in this room. The world don't look the same from in here. Now, you don't wanna be here, do you? Sleeping on the floor wearing dirty clothes, eating shit I wouldn't feed the dog. Three days now. Don't you wanna be somewhere comfortable? I want to be home. Well, then, help me out. Speak a little truth. You got a hideout in the woods somewhere or a tent, something like that? He's a little kid, man. He's out there by himself right now probably scared to death. He'd be safer here with us. And then, Valentin, my boys went back out at your place yesterday, found quite a stash. Breaking into cars, growing weed. You got yourself quite a little criminal enterprise, don't' you? Where do you grow it? Hey, where does this come from? Why don't you ask the Reverend? You write your name on the wall yet? Where is he going? Don't worry about him. Come on now. It's a tradition. Don't want me to forget you, do you? - Where you going? - Not far. You remember where your crop is, I'll come right on back. You see Poco around? My family of criminals? Hey. All right, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I mean, the little one, he's got no choice. But I got some questions for him. Nope. I haven't seen them. Yeah. I see how you watch out for him. Even from a distance more than his mom had ever did. Now, did he say anything to you? Where he was going? John, I don't know. I told you. All right. Sorry. He's with Valentin. He always is. Not today, unless he's hiding in that cell. What do you mean? Chief. Valentin... he remembered. Valentin... Dummy... Always in trouble. I have to fix your mess. Reverend. "When we were baptized into union with Christ Jesus." "We were baptized into union with his death." "We were buried with him and shared his death." "So that we might also be raised, to live a new life." A new life. Poco! Hallelujah! Jesus. - Get off of me! - Hush up. - Get off! - I said hush up! Same lies, all the same lies. - He was there! - Purple flowers. Fuck you! I didn't mean to do that. Asshole! Calm down! Get something to bandage the boy. Look at this! You do this to a boy for some fucking pot? Oh, no. No, no. Pot's the least of your worries now. We found a body, a dead body. In the quarry? That's right. With purple flowers all around. Yeah? I know this because we stole his boxes, his clothes. The flowers were inside. Yeah. That's what Poco told you. Yeah. Our stories match. Matching stories ain't hard to do. I killed no man. Look into the new man's eyes and ask him about the quarry. They will not look like mine. Truth, Chief. "And I heard a voice from heaven saying, 'Write these words.'" "'Blessed are the dead, who will from now on die in the Lord.'" "'Yes, ' says the spirit. 'They will rest from their labors for their deeds follow them wherever they go.'" Celia? I know you are here today because of a man. Did anyone know him? If anyone would like to say anything? He wants you to pray. Pray? Yes. Our Father... Amen. That's the most folks I've seen in this building in a long time. You must be the real deal. I guess you heard what we found out at the quarry. Everybody heard. Hmm. But I got him. I heard that, too. The wolves beat us to him though, or dogs, some kind of animal. Gnawed the flesh off his body. Plucked out his eyes. Ate his tongue. But, it all adds up: the evidence, bloody clothes, and all that. Guy must've snuck up on him after their stash. He surprised them. They panicked. And then instinct, the lizard brain. Who was he? Yeah. We didn't find an ID. Probably just another illegal. More of them around here than you can imagine, more coming every day. Kind of what I was expecting with you, to be honest. You thought I'd be an illegal? A minority. We're all minorities now, right? This part of the country? Last I checked, I was white. Jesus made things too easy. Forgiveness, all you got to do is ask. Nobody's got to be responsible for what they've done. My daddy wore this badge 33 years. It was a good job back then. You get to help people, you know. He was like the mayor. People waved to him when he walked into town on Sunday afternoon. They were glad to see him. I always thought that was cool. Wanted that for myself when I grew up. But it ain't cool. And nobody's ever glad to see me. All I do is run around sweeping mud off the streets. What's that got to do with forgiveness? Well, it's hard to stay clean when everything you touch is dirty. They're saying things about you, Reverend. The boys in that cell. Well, people will say anything to save themselves. The body, it needs to be buried. So soon? Yeah, we got the fingerprints and all that, the official stuff. Nothing's gonna come of it. That's the risk you take crossing over. But the poor bastard took blunt trauma to the skull. The least we can do is give him some restful peace. Will you do it? It's my job. Hey, your wife. Is that how she died? Was it a Mexican? No. She lost control of her car out on Highway 2. It was raining. She got T-boned by a semi. Never knew what hit her. I brought you this. Your brother needs it. Valentin, don't be a fool. I can take care of him. No. Not in here you can't. Suddenly we matter to you? You call me a fool but you live in a house of lies. You deserve each other. A liar in bed with a liar. Shut up! John is a good man. He has a good heart. He will find the truth. He will be just. You'll see. I'm not talking about the Chief. My daddy used to say, "You wanna catch a killer, you go to the funeral. Look for anyone there who shouldn't be. That's your man." Nobody here today though, except Jonas. Hey, Jonas. You kill this guy? That's what I thought. Go ahead. I'll, uh, I'll just read a verse. "In the place of the dead, there's excitement over your arrival. The spirits of world leaders and mighty kings long dead, stand up to see you. Everyone there will stare at you and ask, 'Can this be the one who shook the earth and made the kingdoms of the world tremble? Is this the one who destroyed the world and made it into a waste land? Is this the king who demolished the world's greatest cities and had no mercy on his prisoners?' And with one voice they will all cry out, 'Rejoice.' For now, you are as weak as we are." That's a weird fucking verse. Amen. Can't help you, unless you talk. I've been here days. Days. Listen, I'm the only public defender in a three-county area. That's a lot of people, okay? Now, I'm sorry you've been waiting here longer than you cared to, but that's just the way it is. Things take time. Would not take time, if we were white. Takes time if you're white or black, or pink and purple polka dots. The policeman hates us. Hates our skin. Policeman hates criminals. Are you a criminal? I'll never get a fair trial. Not with a white lawyer. You watch too much damn TV. I had a cousin married to a Latina. - What? - Leave. Okay. These are some serious charges, son. It's drugs today, but they tell me it's soon to be murder. You'd be wise to swallow some of that pride and accept the help of the state. You're a young man. You got some life yet to live. And your little brother back there, he ain't hardly lived his life yet at all. Do yourself a favor and think about that, all right? Adios. I'm sorry. For what? Plenty of things, I'm sure. These are real. Come in. This is kind of a weird question, but do you remember what his bandage looked like? The night he came to town, he had a... a bandage on his hand, you remember what it looked like? Yeah. It was bloody. But was it like a... a bandana or a piece of cloth or maybe a sleeve? A sleeve? I just wondered if you remember. That's a weird detail to worry about. Well, no detail is too small. I have to study the clues with great care and attention. Using a delicate touch... with force when necessary. Yo, Chief, come quick! What is it? You wouldn't believe if I told you. Come on. Pardon my Español, Reverend, but you look like shit. Well, this ought to cheer you up. He confessed, Valentin, to the van, the dope, the dead man, all of it. Why would he confess? Because he did it, and he's in a cage. And his brother? Valentin swears he acted alone. Probably not true, of course, but at this point, it's a deal I can take. I'm gonna need a statement from you, in court, testimony about the van and all, it won't be much. Mm-hmm. Guilt's a heavy burden, ain't it, Reverend? Most men can't carry it alone. Feel better. It's over now. How does that feel? You can just sail away. - You have five minutes. - Thank you. They will hang you. Better only me than my brother, too. Let me pray with you. What do you wanna pray for? For this? For Poco? Listen to me, whatever you've done, whatever put you in here... You put me in here! Tell me your name. Please just... just pray with me. Tell me your name. Our father... Liar! You are no preacher, cabrón! - Oh, Father, we pray to you... - No! God does not hear your words! We ask for your forgiveness, Father. - Shut up! It is a lie! - Have mercy. It's a lie! Fucking asshole! Shut up! Liar! Listen to me. Just listen to me! Get back! Liar! Liar! You are no man of God. You will burn in Hell, asshole! There is nothing you can do to make this right. You will burn! Settle down! I will see you there! Right here, right now. There is power in confession. Call the first witness. Put right hand on the Bible and your left hand in the air. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Hm. State your name for the record. State your name for the record, please. Are you David Martin? Are you the Reverend David Martin? I'm sorry... sorry, Your Honor. I'm sorry. Your Honor, um, I haven't been feeling, um, well lately. Are you able to continue? Mm-hm. All right. One last time... state your name for the record. My name is David Martin, reverend of the Town Church. Thank you, Reverend. Go with her. Now please tell the court what happened the night you arrived in town. Well, uh, I parked my van in front of the church and, um, and I met the... Hey, hey, stop! Poco! Get back! Stop! Get out of the way! - Poco! - Stop! Stop! Hey, stop! I said stop! Chief, where'd he go? I don't know, in here somewhere. He might be heading to the river. But he ain't leaving without his brother. We must be sure we find him first. You hear me? I'mma find your brother. I'll find him! Oh, shit. Oh, God. Celia, you in here? What? Tell me. What? What is your name? It doesn't matter. My name is Sinner. I murdered my wife... and her lover. I caught them. I murdered David Martin... the body at the quarry, you were right. I took everything from you. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please... Please forgive me, forgive me. Forgive me, forgive me. Forgive me. Would you forgive me? Forgive me. I am not the one who can forgive. You ever think of leaving? What do you mean, like running away? Like making a new start, leaving the past behind? Sure. Just catch a dream bound for paradise. Why not? The past is always with you. What's that mean?
