Don't tell me you forgot the gold stuff, too. You know what? I think I've heard that shit before. It's like total skunk, right? Like that shit gets you high! No, Zack, no. The pans. We're gonna pan for gold. Dude, it was your idea. Oh, yeah. Gold. Okay, look. I looked up stuff on the Net and stuff, and I found, like, these historic sites where you still find gold. Look, it's really cool.Right on. This is your first vacation without your parents, right? Oh, shh! Riff! You want a historic sight? Just keep your eye on, uh, Kate and me. Mmm... Yeah. Hey, what if we did find gold, and we struck it, like, totally rich? I'd buy the Sea-Quarium, dude, where Shamu lives, make a bong out of it. You are pathetic. What if you were Shamu? I'd get Shamu so high. What would I do if we found gold? Well, first, I'd buy a tan like Vicky. And then, I don't know, I'd travel for a couple years. I wanna buy a house and settle down one day. Big backyard, big swimming pool, jungle gym and monkey bars. What do you think, Riff? Who knows? Maybe Kate and I... settle down and have us some children. Oh, really. I'd like to do a little baby-making. Keep your pants on. I was just dreaming. What would you do, Ashley? Well, I'd save the animals. Come on, Ash! That is so lame! No, it's not. Whatever. You would go shopping. How about you, Vicky? I would buy a set of boobs and a really hot convertible. Then another bigger set of boobs. What are you doing? Dude, you said turn right. I took a right. Get the shit out of your ears, dude. I said, "Turn right here." Left. All right, look. This is too complex for me. Dude, maybe you should drive again. That's what I'm talking about. It must mean "campsites." Told ya I knew what I was doing. Uh, campsites? I don't think so, guys. Yo, I'm not camping out here. Whoa. Look. Did you see that? What? That. Wait. Where did it go? Lookin' for someone in particular? Holy shit! Where'd you come from, man? Watch your language, boy. Have a little respect for the dearly departed. Um, we're lost, and I don't even know why I came here. You're here because you begged me to come with my crazy friends because your parents were out of town. That's right, bee-yotch. I'm a crazy mo-ooh! We're looking for the river. Someplace to camp out? Best place is back thataway. Right on down there where y'all come from. All the way back there to where you come from. We're going camping. Can you help us or not? Yeah, we heard this place called The Heathers was the spot. You know, just campsites by the river. You know, middle of nowhere. No people, no rules.

Go stand where I showed you. They ought not to be alone in them woods. They're 15, Lon. They're not stupid. I wasn't referring to Simon. Simon is such a sweet and loving boy. And Stanley. He resents Simon. Simon? You can turn around now. Stanley, wait. I won't... I won't duck next time. You know how mean Stanley is. He is hateful. Just like you. Not on purpose. Yes. Yes, on purpose. ...forty-nine, fifty. Fifty feet, Stanley. We're definitely breaking some rules. Let's play a game. Simon says. I like Simon says. Simon says smoke this. No, Stanley. TV says bad.

He was shitting us, right? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What now? What? Oh, I just totally got a vision, dude. Of him actually shitting us. Shitting us out his ass! Zack, they named the place after you. Yeah. "Beer." No. "Minor tool." That's not what your mom said last night. Anybody in? Hello? Hello! Hello. Hello? Hey, Ashley. They got all your favorites. Ew! What are friends for? Twins. Yo!

I'm... not... retarded. Simon... not crazy. Not crazy! Not retarded! Not crazy! Way to go, asshole. You can see he's not right. God... Sometimes I wonder why I'm even with you. Excuse my brother. He's got, uh, good days and... bad. Yeah? These. And, uh... for the gas. And I-I think that's it. Yeah. Oh, um, and ice. No ice. Sorry. Yeah, we don't, uh, get a lot of folks coming through here. Not a lotta call for necessities. Must get... pretty lonely up here. I mean, with, uh, you know, being in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. Well, it's not so bad, you know. Uh, especially if I could spend it with a dream girl... like you. What? What happened? What'd you do? That pump is dead as a fuckin'... Oh. Looks like I missed the fun, huh? Uh, can we just pay and get out of here? Yeah. Hey, I see you had a cooler back there. You mind if we grab some beers? No beer. That's it, man. Dude, chill, chill, chill, chill. Sorry. Steroids. Hey, uh, that looks like you up there, huh? You got a... You got a twin brother? And you're dressed up as, uh, Billy the Kid, I bet. That's pretty cool. Gravedigger dude over on the hill over there, he was saying Billy the Kid, he killed a man for every year he was alive. There's no way he could have killed anybody when he was a baby, right? So I was figuring maybe he started when he was a teen. My God. Which one are you? You know, he killed somebody every two years, three years. Maybe took a year off. Killed four or five just to catch up. Stanley? Simon? Hey. I think that's all. Just the Jack and, uh, we'll be gone. Your money's no good here. Just, uh, think of it as my present for ya.

Simon always looked up to you. I know everyone paid attention to him, but he always looked up to you. Yes, sir. Yeah, that's right. Right. Mm-hmm. Y-Y-Yeah. Promise I won't go anywhere. Besides, it looks like your friend wants me to touch him. Stanley, untie my hands. Don't worry about her. She can't see us. And we'll be real quiet. And if anything hurts, then I'll kiss it and I'll make it all better. Come on, Stanley. You've worked really hard for this. And it's time someone paid attention to you. What if I need two hands? You like it rough? I can be real rough. You know, pleasure and pain are so close, sometimes you can't even tell them apart. You've had too much pain, Stanley. It's time for pleasure. Let me help you. This is what you want. Look at me, Stanley. Do you like that? Give me your hand. I'm gonna make you feel something... you've never felt before. You forgot to say "Simon says"! Ow! I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill him for you, Zack. I'm gonna kill him for you, for everyone. There's only one way outta here... and it's the way I'm comin' in! I hope you enjoyed your little run. 'Cause, uh... I didn't! Simon says I'm Stanley! And Simon! Simon was in a coma for years, and I took his place! After all, who's gonna convict a crazy retard! You know what the best part being Simon? Handicap parkin'! And now, now I know... you like Simon better than me, I'm gonna kill ya! I know you're here. I can feel ya. I can smell ya. I can taste ya. You forgot to say, "Simon says." I'm just gonna... Stanley... Stanley. Oh, God. Please. Who is that? Whoa, look. Where did she go? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, check that out. Oh! I am so sorry. I-I don't know why I did that, Simon. That me. Hey. Hey, man, you open? Always open. Seven... twenty-four. Dude, tell me I'm not that retarded. I could, but I'd be lyin'. We just need some gas and some... some junk, like food, beer... Beer. And ice. We have money. But listen, mostly... we need you to direct us to the most righteous campsite in the most remote spot... in the deepest, darkest part of the woods, where dangerous men do dark deeds. I can do that. So... do it. You... forgot to say... "Simon says." Simon make a joke. Fuckin' weirdo. Dream girl, it's, uh, time to have some fun!
