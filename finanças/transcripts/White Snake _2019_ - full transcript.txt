Xiao-Qing Sis? I almost lost control again. I have practiced the mystic arts for five hundred years, will soon be transcendent and archive immortality. But every time I tried, I failed. Yes. You were risking your life all the time. In my heart, there is a hollow. Am I missing something? Every time I was about to transcend, Something would shatter my mind and throw me into chaos. What do I miss? Hold it. This Jade Hairpin? You've been wearing it all the time, and never allow me to touch it. Now you can touch it. It belongs to you, in the first place. Hold it tightly. 【Five hundred years ago】 It was in the late Tang Dynasty, the world was slipping into chaos. It was in the late Tang Dynasty, the world was slipping into chaos. Demons and monsters were haunting the human world. The Emperor was obsessed with the idea of achieving immortality, But Lord of Greater Yin, the Supreme Taoist, failed him repeatedly. The Emperor was furious. The Supreme Taoist commanded the people to catch snakes for him and used snakes to enhance his power to regain the Emperor's favor. [Chanting] I have prepared myself, guide the Spirits to my flesh. [Chanting] Let the Greater Yin gather the Power I need, be the place to forge my body. [Chanting] I have prepared myself, guide the Spirits to my flesh. [Chanting] Let the Greater Yin gather the Power I need, be the place to forge my body. Assassin! Assassin is on the bow, catch her! The archers are in position! Where does she go? Ah, you're here, miss. Who are you? I know it's chaotic outside, but don't be afraid. Where is this place? Here is the snakecatcher village. What's your name? Where do you live? I... Miss, is there anything you can remember? Ah, snakecatchers are back. It was Xuan who brought you here yesterday. Xuan? Most of villagers here live by catching snakes. We built our village like this, it's because there are lots of beasts in the woods around the village. it said there are also demons out there. I'm a demon, I'm gonna eat you! Ah, demon is coming! You have no place to run! Be careful, watch your step. Auntie! The herbs collected by Xuan worked great! My injury has almost healed! Be careful next time, it's very dangerous to catch snakes. Wow! See how pretty that girl is? Sister Hua, could you hand me a jar of realgar wine? Those wine are great,right? They mixed a lot realgar with them. Miss? Shall we go? Xu Xuan! you are the last, again! Just stay outside, live with snakes. It's brother Xuan! You are awake! Dudou? Why are you hiding here? Xuan, you haven't caught any snake, have you? Do you want my snakes? Ha! Why do you want to join with us, since you are so afraid of snakes? Those herbs you collected could not be used to deduct your tax. Although I can't use them to deduct tax, to save some lives, that's enough for me. Brother Xuan is back! Do you bring toys for us? Look at this and this. Who wants this? Miss? Xuan, she can't remember anything. Miss Don't worry, everything will be OK. I can take you to the place where I found you, tomorrow. Maybe we can find some clues. Nowadays, we are catching snakes down there. Why do you catch snakes? In last few years, the country was in turmoil, Our taxes were getting heavier and heavier. The Supreme Taoist allows us to use snakes to deduct our taxes, and said people who catches snakes will be free from his servitude. So, villagers began to catch snakes. Catching snakes is a tough job, if you don't do it, life will be much tougher than now. Look, it was under that waterfall. I know it's a short cut, Dudou. But it's already difficult enough for us to climb. What shall we do with her? Dudou! You know magic! I will go there by myself. Take you time to climb. Dodou, we can't let her wait us, can we? Dudou? Just head home! It is really a great thing to have magic. It seems that you must be one of those who practice mysitc arts. I can't recall anything. What is this place? This is the hut I built. Usually I will make some small stuffs here. or dry my herbs. Maybe one day I can be a doctor, then I won't have to catch snakes anymore. Bao-An-Tang Why do you call it Bao An Tang? This? It's just a plaque I found near river. Speak of that, at that day I was making umbrellas when I suddenly heard Dodou was barking. When I got there, I saw you were lying on a rock by the waterfall, Half of your body was in water. For the sake of everyone, I have to command you to assassin the Supreme Taoist. Master, I know he is our enemy, The brothers and sisters will thank you. But I've just finished my trainning. There are rules in this world. There are lots of things you have to do even if you don't want to. Did you just recall something? Xuan, Is there something you don't want to do, but you have to do? me? I have tons of those things. But, since I'm living in this world, I definitely want to experience this world carefreely. So, I try to learn a bit of everything. Medicine, divination, Astrology, Occult, Five elements and Eight Trigrams. I know a little bit of all those things. Even if I can't choice my destiny, I shall make my life carefree. [Chanting] Let the Greater Yin gather the Power I need, be the place to forge my body. Are you all right? I'm flying. I'm flying right now! You! You see! It feels so good! I'm riding the wind, freely wondering between heaven and earth! Xuan! It's okay. I'm cling on this. What is it? Come up, we can talk it later. OK Miss? Isn't she the assassin the Supreme Taoist wanted? Indeed, it's her. Supreme Taoist? Asssassin? Be careful, it could e atrap Let's cut off one of her hands before she wakes up Who is here?

We can go to there and ask them for its details. Thank you, Xuan. Actually, you don't have to help me, you don't even know who I am. Although I don't know who you are, I think You're not a wicked people. We bring the order from the Supreme Taoist. Open your gate! I need everyone to be present! Supreme Taoist... Those two soldiers Hurry, we shall leave. Your honor, snakes are extremely hard to find this year. We are risking lives to... Nowadays, the world is in turmoil, demons are haunting the country.

Don't worry, as long as you tell me the truth, you won't be harmed. Yes, yes, I will tell you. I saw her was with Xu Xuan. Search the village. Yes How long shall we hide here? Everyone is anxious and scared. Such important task, Master should send me to do it. The scout is back! Is it really she who injured you? Yes. Not just injured me, she almost killed me. Als, I don't know why, The Supreme Taoist's fleet is coming in this way. Master, She must has turned to that Taoist, betrayed us. And Master, there was a snakecatcher by her side.

Otherwise, the Death Scales will be activated, and even I can not save your life. Understand. Chang-Pan So, those things belong to that boy, right? Tell my Master, lead him to here. Yes If I could drain her power, I won't need you villagers to catch snakes anymore. We will be Yongzhou City soon. Are you still trying to recall your past? It's indeed inconvenient if a person can't remember her past. Where has she been? who has she meet? What has she done? However, Some things are better left forgotten than remembered. It said, just as the blooming flowers and the withering grasses, life is fleeting, filled with odreals and seldom happiness. If so, we only need to remember those happiness, and everything will be fine. Captain the song you sang is too old fashion. It's outdated for a long time. Let me try something new. Ok, let you sing. Can't you see the river which flows to the east, No one knows where it comes from, no one knows where it goes to. Can't you see the sun which hangs over the city?

Even if you are a demon, so what? For example... Dudou! Even if Dudou turns into a demon, I still like him. And even as a demon, he will like me. Right? Really? Never said that, I'm just trying to earn a living. Why can I speak now? Why am I speaking now? How can I speak? I'm not supposed to speak! What if I'm treated as a demon, and slayed by a Taoist, because I can talk? Why does my voice sound like this? Why does my voice sound like this? Shh, quite. The boatman will hear you.

Dudou, Why did he hug me? Your body were as cold as ice. Xuan was worried, so he hugged you, used himself as a stove, so you can wake up. It was so cold that the whole room was frozen. We didn't left you behind. You know? You are here. I thought you left without a goodbye. That tail... I'm really a monster. What then? There are plenty of wicked people with two legs in this world, you just have a tail, so what? You are not a wicked people. Your honors my families took great pains to flee to here, please offer me some foods. Why are there so many stinky beggars in the city? Don't stand there, get out of the way! Those refugees... they are so pitiful. They're the lucky ones. At least, they can find some shelters in Yongzhou City. What happened? Nothing... Let's go. Hey! A dog is still here. 【 Precious Jade Workshop 】 Faster! Feels I have been here before. Mu, Li, Position No. 31. Stop! Ah, we have guests. Why do you come back to my humble abode, dear? Is there something wrong with your magic weapon? Yes. We want to know the origin of this magic weapon. Interesting Although you are a human, you smell like a demon. you smell like a demon. Ah, you have been intimate with a demon, haven't you? In this case, come. All kinds of demons within a hundred miles if they need a presonal magic weapon for their task, will visit our Pericous Jade Workshop. We are the forging shop for demon's weapon. Go to work This Jade Hairpin is not yours, it belonged someone else. It designed to drain other's power, and transfer them to its owner. Draining power? Right. This thing, is quite formidable. Last time you were here, dear, you wanted to modify it, so that you can use it. Approve. Approve. No way. But, the modfication may cause some unknown problems. No wonder. She lost her memory when I met her. Ah...That's right. It took someone's power, but, But it may also took the memory of its owner. Without memory, how can someone control his power? It's the way of this world, for every gain, a loss. Wonderful, wonderful. Then, why you... But she insisted. And I, the old fox, have some self-pride. Tricks like grafting magic, altering the world, turning a human into a demon, turning a demon into a human, and other Heaven-defying things, we have interests in. Then, about its original owner, could you help us to find some clues? Of course What a large scale. Her magic is powerful, and share the same source as mine. I know it's a snake scale. Snake? Snake-catcher! Xiao-Bai! Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Qing? Xiao-Bai? Xiao-Qing! You are Xiao-Qing. I... I recall who I am. That day, Master gave the Jade Hairpin to you, command you to assassinate the Supreme Taoist, Can't you remember those things, Sis? Why does Supreme Taoist ask people to catch snakes? That bastard Taoist is practicing the art of Greater Yin, it shares the same source of snake clan. He drains the souls and essences of our snakes to boost his power. Master loathes Supreme Taoist, loathes all the people. As Master said, human are vicious. Everyone of them is vicious. But he is different. When I lost my memory, I didn't have any clues. It was he saved me. No matter how different it is, he is still a human! Turns out that Supreme Taoist has practiced such wicked art. Hypocritical! You're a snakecatcher, you's accomplice I really don't know what Supreme Taoist did. Accomplices must die. What do you want? Xiao-Qing, let him go. Xuan! As a snakecatcher, perseveringly followed sis all the way, you must plot something! As a little demon, so fierce, it's not good for your practice. You! Speak! What are you plotting? You're really assisting Taoist of Greater Yin. I don't know what Taoist of Greater Yin, Greater Yang. I don't know what happened to this cake, either. Sis, see, he is with Supreme Taoist. I believe him. Believe? I don't believe! I will kill you, snake catcher. Look out! Dodge! Sis, haven't you forgotten what Master taught you over and over again? Human are cunning liars and robbers. Xiao-Qing, Although I can't remember that, I have seen all the things with my own eyes, he's absolutely not. I still remember that! Come with me Be careful. There is something wrong with this place. I never thought, there is such a secret passage under this pagoda. We have to find a way out. Xiao-Bai! Xiao-Bai! Vermilion Bird is on the top, Black Tortoise is in the center. The center repesents Internal Trigram, the gates repesent External trigram. Eight different gates. Gate of Life The Gate of Life is in this way. Don't worry, We passed through the Gate of Life, it's safe now. What is this place? It seems this is an underground magical trap used to imprison demons, but it can't harm human. Why is there a underground trap created by Taoists? Maybe it was a Taoist temple at the first place, but became desolate. Others altered it into a tower. Don't worry I can figure out how the trap works. I'm sure we can get out. Now, I'll find a way out. Stay here, wait for me. The Heaven and Earth follow the same rule, everythings in this world are from the same source. We shall conquer millions of trails, to prove our righteous belief. Ghosts and demons shall be terrorized, Spirits and monsters shall be disintegrated. Slay monsters and extinguish demons, destory their bodys and shatter their souls. [Chanting] Let the Greater Yin gather the Power I need, be the place to forge my body. I prepared this magic weapon for years, Bring it with you, and assassinate the Lord of Greater Yin. Miss? I recall everything now. I've found the way out. Let's go. Xuan... Are demons destined to be slayed? Xiao-Bai... You... Slaying monsters, extinguishing demons, forcing us to catch snakes, but nobody cares the world is in turmoil. I only know that the more we slay demons, the more chaotic the world is. Xiao-Bai no matter what happens, I will be with you. Slay monsters and extinguish demons, destory their bodys and shatter their souls. Dodou... You... Sis? Xiao-Qing, I'll go with you. Sis, you finally understood. Where are you going? Xuan Let's separate. Why? The way of this world are merciless. There are rules in this world. There are things you have to do, even if you don't want to. You are a human. I am a demon. As you said, Some things are better left forgotten than remembered. You're right. Human and demon are different, the way of this world cares nothing about love. But we care. I will find a way. I'll come back Wait for me You are a human. Being with me will only ruin you. Sis, he won't come back. We shall go now. Sis... We have accompanied each other day and night for hundreds years. But it feels different, with him. Through hard practicing and lots of ordeals, we demons try so hard to gain these attractive bodys, these delicate features. But we will always reveal our ture self, from time to time. At that time, will he still like you? I remember that Master said, only human understand the taste of love and desires. When I woke up, I thought I was a human. What's good about the taste of love and desires? Right now, I'm lying here, this big stone statue holds me in its arms, it also feels good. The stone statue is cold. So Am I ? What's that on you body? Don't touch me. It's the curse of Sorching Death Scales. I promised Master that I would take you back to the cave in three days. Otherwise... The Death Scales will be activated, and it will tear up your body and kill you. Why did you... Hurry up, surround the tower. Sis... Youth, I can help you. Really? Youth, I had been young, been frivolous, been indulgent, and I am filled with lots of regrets nowadays. You shall know One day, you might be regret for this. If we can't be together I'll regret it immediately. Great, youth is youth. For every bussiness, there is an offer and payment. Are you sure you can pay me with what I want? Whatever you want. Good. There is a way. I can turn you into a demon. I, demon? Yes, demon. If you are a demon, you can be together. However You have to trade with your essence. The magic weapons we created for all kinds of demons are perfused with essences of human. Those greatest of magic weapon are forged with the essences. This is why our Preicous Jade is so famous in the demon world. I need to become a demon. I accept. Great. But, do you know, what will happen if you become a demon? You are born to be a human, enjoy the peace and comforts of the human world, take them for granted without knowing why. Being a demon, Heaven wants you died. Human wants you died. The Taoist wants to kill you. Other demons also will kill you. Once I take away your essence, being a demon, You can only be the weakest and littlest kind. No matter how hard you try, you can not become powerful. I understand now. Let's do it. Good We have a deal. Ah, I almost forgot, To turn a human into a demon I also need to take one thing from you. What thing? No, No, you can't Let him go. Beauty, we meet again What's the secret of this hairpin that let a little demon as you dare to assassinate my Master? A snake that have become a snake demon, draining your power to enhance the art of Greater Yin that my Master taught will be better than draining thousands of snakes. You...! So I told my Master that you are in Snake-catcher Village Now, Master should arrive there soon. Since I can capture you by myself. How should I share with my Master? You little Taoist have so many wicked ideas. But thanks for your informations, once we beat you, then we'll deal with your Master. Hum... Ah, it turns out that you're a so ugly Taoist. No wonder you got jealous, once you see the beautiful statue in the tower, and smashed him. Let's see how you will get out of my trap. Xuan, Xuan Wake up Xuan, Xuan Xuan It's still here, still here. How are you feeling? Dudou! You have a tail now! Look! I'm a demon now! Yes, you have a tail now! Dudou, where is your tail? What about my tail? Where is my tail! Turns out it was Dudou's tail. My tail! Yours! See, Dudou, we're all demons now. From now on, if I get good stuffs, there will be your share. Let's go, Dudou! Dudou! I'm running so fast now. Too fast, I can't catch up. I'm back! I am a demon now, Xiao-Bai. Haven't you been taken away the essence? Run so fast... Xiao-Bai, Xiao-Bai! Where are you, Xiao-Bai? Xiao-Bai! Xuan, Xuan Don't drain me. I beg you, I beg you Xuan, look. Demon is coming, run! Xiao-Bai! Xiao-Bai! Xiao-Bai? Hurry up! Xiao-Bai, Xiao-Bai! It's so big! Is that Xiao-Bai? Xuan, I figure we'd better to change back. Xuan, I figure we'd better to change back. You really come back. But Sis now is a gaint serpent. The Taoist grabbed Sis's hairpin, And sis somehow drained his power. How could this happen? Really? You turned youself into a demon? Boy, how long did you know her? How deep could you fall for her? You was just infatuated with sis's beauty. Now, my sis turns into this scary look. Do you still like her? Where is she going now? Your snakecatcher Village. Boy, don't you know? Supreme Taoist is ahead to your snake catcher village, and sis is going to deal with him. Supreme Taoist That village will soon be doomed. Our village? Love? Xuan, What should we do now? Back to village The fleet of Supreme Taoist arrived at snake catcher village? I saw with my own eyes, there are lots of boats. Is it possible he knows where we are hiding, wants to pick a fight? How did he know where we were? Is there someone.... Chang-pan is quite loyal. Green snake is cursed with the Death Scales. They can't betray us. Is White Snake the one who betrayed us? She surrendered to the Supreme Taoist. There is a traitor in our clan. If we are waiting for the enemy to come to our door, we are waiting for death. But if we fight for our lives, we might survive this. All members of our clan attack the snake catcher village! Slay the traitor! Kill Taoists! Destroy the snake-catcher village! Slay the traitor! Kill Taoists! Destroy the snake-catcher village! Slay the traitor! Kill Taoists! Destroy the snake-catcher village! Everyone! Run for your life, our village is in danger. A gaint serpent, it's coming. Run for your life, leave the village! What nonsense are you talking? The walls of our village are high enough, why should I fear? Yongzhou City, it was already ruined by the gaint serpent. Everyone, run for your life. Leave! now! The walls of Yongzhou is built by stones. Ruined by a gaint serpent? Nonsence. Xuan You're finally home. Auntie, leave here, hurry up. Ok, I'll go home and pack things up. Don't bother pack up, leave... The Lord of Greater Yin, the One who See through the Unreal and Divine the Truth. A gaint serpent? But you're a demon. How could we know you're not lying? As a Supreme Taoist, don't protect the people, you are doing nothing but wicked. He's really a demon. Yes, I am a demon. But I'm still Xuan! I came back to warn you run away. Yongzhou City was destroyed Here will soon be destroyed, too. Listen to me, get out of here... You... You are demon! A powerless little demon. Catching snakes, Catching snakes, To enhance your power, you forced us to risk our lives to catch snakes, drove Xiao-Bai to turn herself into a gaint serpent! She is comeing. Release me. I can stop her. Never mind, I let you go. Xiao-Bai! Xiao-Bai Those people in Yongzhou City You were not intentional to harm them, you were defending soldiers of Supreme Taoist But those people lived in the village, even though they caught snakes, they are innocent. You can't turn snake catcher Village into another Yongzhou City! Xiao-Bai! Xiao-Bai, listen to me I have turned myself into a demon We're both demons, now. I know you are a gaint serpent now, so what? This world is so vast that it has place for countless mountains and lakes. Comparing to it, your gaint body means nothing. Xiao-Bai, even I am the weakest demon, I will risk everything to protect you. If this world don't allow us to be together. We will travel to the end of this world, In this vast universe, there will be a place for us. We shall stay together day and night be a pair of carefree demons. Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai! Sis! sister What a gaint serpent! Thanks to you, little demon, I had time to set up this Demon Trap. Soon, your bodies and souls will be disintegrated. What is it? This is your soul. Snake catcher, litte demon, Disintegrating your soul, do you understand? Once your vitality is consumed, your soul will be disintegrated. And you will vanish forever, no more reincarnation. No more reincarnation? What a pity! It's a waste to disintegrate you like this, It's better to let me make use of you. Once I finish the art of Greater Yin, I will transend mortality, The Emperor will realize that I know how to live forever. Live forever? Although you talked about Taoism and immortality, you just covet our power. Come on, drain my power! What is this?
