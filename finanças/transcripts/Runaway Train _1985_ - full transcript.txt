Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison, Alaska, USA The men ranged in ages from 14 to 19. All were killed in the plane crash. Names are being withheld until notification of next of kin. We switch now to our reporter at the federal courthouse for the latest on the Manheim-Stonehaven Prison case. We've just gotten word that the federal judge has issued his opinion in this case. We don't have all the details, but apparently Oscar Manheim, the notorious life-term prisoner who has been welded in his cell for three years, has won his civil rights suit against officials at Stonehaven. Stay with us for details. Well be back with comment from Associate Warden Ranken. Yeah. I say yeah. (men shouting) Hey, Rogers. Rogers, looky here, man. What's up? Manny's won his case. The court's ordered to let him out of the hole. Great. That's great. Warden Ranken's gonna be on the tube in a couple of minutes. Let the dudes hear him talk that shit he talks. Put Channel 9 into the speakers. Rogers? Rogers? Have you got shit in your veins or what, man? I was holding my mud around here when you were peeing in your diapers. All right. They'll all hear it. Fucking A, man. I say, Rogers, thanks, man. Yeah. Nobody wants prison to be easy. We want criminals punished. But don't you think you shocked the public by keeping a man welded in a cell for three years? Well, a man, yes. But Manheim is an animal. He broke out of here twice, he's robbed banks, he's a killer. He doesn't care about your life, my life, or even his own life... Fuck your mother. - Get it out your ass, Ranken. - Fat-faced faggot. Somebody shoot that Nazi vegetable. Manny for president. Seventeen. He believes in nothing, so he's capable of anything. I've worked in prisons for 26 years. Fiends with strings of murders are afraid of him. Jesus Henry Christ. Ow. Yeah. (men shouting) Hey, Jonah. Jonah. Hey, Jonah. - Manny did it, man. - Yeah. He really fucking did it. That's good, man. I'll see you in the yard. Yeah. Yeah. If, as you say, he is an animal, then why do all the prisoners love him so much? Well, because they're... they're mostly animals, just like he is. They wanna do whatever they want, no holds barred. Open the fucking door. Fuck you and the horse you rode in on. Open this goddamn door, Rogers. This is no country club. Stonehavens average sentence is 22 years. Turn that fucker off. ( The Yellow Rose of Texas) Fuck your mother. Chinga tu madre, pinche bitch. ( The Yellow Rose of Texas continues) Ranken, how do you like the renovation on your prison? We fixed it for ya. Ranken, your mother's a dog and you're an asshole. Hey, Manny. You got visitors. On your feet, convict. On your feet. I've got a court order to let you out of the hole. Course, I could ask for a stay during the appeal. The court would go for that. I can last nine more months through an appeal. I could stand on my head nine months. I oughta wreck this door and kick your... Fuck you. You wouldn't do it alone. I don't dirty my hands on scum like you. I'm gonna let you out in the yard. And I hope you make a move so I can stop your clock. That's a promise. Yeah, a promise. You promised to keep me in this hole for the rest of my life. I kept you in here for three years. That's long enough for me, kid. Whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger. We'll see. Please try again, and I'll send you out of here in plastic. You do what you have to do and I'll do what I have to do. Whatever happens happens. Call the machine shop. Bring him to the yard. That's your mama's fart-hole, Ranken. The bitch is loud. You're all punks, hiding there, yelling in the dark. Let me tell you where you assholes stand. First there's God. Then the warden. Then my guards. Then the dogs out there in the kennel. And finally you, pieces of human waste. No good to yourselves or anybody else. Yeah, here he is, man. The big man. Hey, Manny. Homeboy. It's me, Home. I'm blind, man. I can't see. Hey, Manny. Here you go, man. Let's go. Should be time for lock-up. Let me get that for you, Manny. What's been happening these past three years? Just what you know. I went out and got a fresh 30-year sentence. - Couldn't make it without me? - Without the money. Never did know how to rob a bank. The following men have visitors... Don't worry about it. I'll get you out. - Not in this winter, you won't. - I won't? - Kiss my white ass. - Hey, what's the...? He's a pretty good youngster. Besides that, he pushes the laundry cart. Welcome home, brother. Welcome home, man. Kill the son of a bitch. One, two... ( Oh. Susanna) Nine. - The kid can fight. - It's worth about two dead flies. Yeah, but you shouldn't judge people hard, man. I'm gonna take a piss. Officer, this guy's grabbing my ass. You kept him in the hole too long, Ranken. Take that punk out. Take him out. Jab. Punch. What are you doing? Come on, man. Yo, man, back off. You all right, man? And still the welterweight champion: Buck McGee. I'm sorry, Manny. Ranken made me do it. - Come on, punk. - No more. Come on. Show me something. Come on, Manny. Come here, you rat stoolie. Come here. Come on. I got something for you. I'm sorry, Manny. No. Stay back. You want me? You want my blood? Here. There, there's my blood. Come on, scum. You wanna shoot me? Shoot me. Shoot to kill, sucker. Here I am. Come on, Ranken. Shoot to kill. Don't send no punk to do your business for ya. I'm right here. Come on. Shoot me. I'm going nowhere. Come on. Come on, Ranken. Make your move. Hey, sucker, you show me shit. No, Joe. He's mine. Get off me. Let me go. Jonah. Jonah. I'll kill ya. I'll kill ya. I'll kill ya. I'll tear his fucking head off. Oh, my God. Can't someone do something? Lockup. Mandatory lock-up. All prisoners in the cell. All prisoners in the cell. Mandatory lock-up. You look terrible. I ain't dead. He released me to the yard. He wants to kill you for sure. Nah, he's pushing me. He wants me to jump the wall. - He's pushing me. - It's 30 below out there. I'm going. You coming? Are you coming? I'll wait for ya. No, brother. This is home. I run things around here. I can't take these ass-kickings like I used to. I can make it. Then get on, brother, and do it. I will. Whatever happens, don't let 'em bring you back here, man. Nah. I'll find some... nice joint in the sun. Manny, the bulls are on the stairs. Let's split. - Have fun. - You too. There's gonna be convicts watching you. Don't let 'em ice ya. It'll break a lot of soul. You know, you got a following, and I love you. Coming through. Hit the basket, man. Coming through. Hey, you guys, hit the basket, ok? Goddamn. Coming through. Check out the starch in these socks. Check my laundry. Get in here and check my laundry. Hey, Buck. See you later. You're late, man. They were late with the showers. Here. Coming through, boss. Coming through. Just hold your horses. - How you doing, Jackson? - What's up? Another bit of laundry, huh? Jackson, have I got a surprise for you. What is it? You know you told me your son is going to the Golden Gloves this year? Shit. Jackson, check 'em out, man. - Thanks, Buck. - You betcha. And I'll tell you what, Jackson. Since you have always been so good to me, you get these suckers for $80. They go for $200, but you get 'em for $80. I don't have $80. No problem. I'll tell you what we do. We'll put you on layaway plan, that is, you get me when you get me. - All right, my man. - No problem. We can work it out. - This is all right. - Yeah. Yeah, nice, huh? This is all right. Ooh, mama. January 1985. This bitch is the creme de la creme of white pussy, isn't she, Jackson? Yeah, that Hugh Hefner sure knows what the fuck he's doing, don't he? You got that right. Hey, she might be white, but she's right. I know, Buck. Hey, let me give you a hand. All right. Hey, Jackson. You tell your boy I said good luck. Thanks, Buck. Thanks for everything. Just walking with the laundry, boss. See? White pussy gets that son of a bitch every goddamn time. Shut up. All right, man. Come on. Come on. Go for it. Go for it. Thanks, youngster. I owe you one. Hey, Manny. Take me with you. Shit, man. I'm going. I'm going, man. I'm fucking going. Yeah. I'm going. I'm going. I'm getting outta here. Manny. Hey, Manny. Shut up, fool. What are you doing here? - Hey, you need me, man. - What good are you? I got two hands to your one, I can more than carry my weight and, look. I got us street clothes. Son of a bitch. Ok, fool. Get your clothes off and grease down. All right. Ooh, mama. This shit is nasty. Goddamn. Ok, Manny. What do we do now? Keep your mouth shut. You talk too much. Coming down. - We gotta go in there? - I am. Duffel bag. Pull the cover over. Oh, man. I don't like this shit. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. - I'm coming, man. I'm coming. - Keep up. It stinks in here, goddamn. You never been in a sewer before? No. Manny, wait up a minute. Wait up. Manny, I put my hands in a pile of shit. Don't worry. It'll rinse off. Here, give me that. If you're gonna get sick, this is the place to do it. Oh, man. This is nasty. This is nasty. Goddamn. Wait. Man. Oh, man. This is so gross. - Ok, what do we do now? - Here, hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Like a baby. Like a baby, hold it. It stinks in here, man. You don't like that smell? That's the smell of freedom, brother. - I'm going. - Wait. Ok, wait. Hey, Manny. Here, man. - Give me the light. - Yeah, the light. Duffel bag. Ok, wait, man. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You know, Ranken's gonna fucking shit his pants, man. Ranken's gonna fucking die. Hey, Manny. Hey, Manny? Manny, where's the light? Fell. - Where'd it fall? - 300 feet into the river. Nobody told me about 300 feet. Nobody told you cos nobody invited you. You wanna go back, go ahead. Me, I'm going. No, man. Manny. Manny. Manny. I'm dying. Manny. I can't breathe. Manny. Manny. Manny. Manny. Manny. They came this way all right. No doubt about it. He did it. The son of a bitch, he did it. Ok. Manny. Manny. Manny. Manny. Stop searching the prison. Notify the state police and get their pictures out. You know what to do. God, don't kill them. Let me do it. Manny. Hold up a goddamn minute. Get your tail out from between your legs. - Manny. I don't wanna die. - I'm hurting too. At least you got shoes. How much farther we gotta go, man? Half a mile. Who knows? Maybe I can make half a mile. Oh, man. Shoes. I need shoes. Oh, man. Oh, man. Put that bench next to the door there. What? Oh. I need some fucking shoes. You know, it's unbelievable, man. Only two other guys got out once, and you beat that sucker three times. Yeah. Manny, don't you know? Ranken is knee-walking pissed off, man. Shit. And the dudes, man. Oh, Manny, the dudes, they love it. They love it. - Freeze, sucker. - Nobody's gonna hear us. Just don't do it. Hey, Manny. You don't treat me like your punk, ok? - You don't like it? - No. Well, you're a prizefighter. Kick my ass. Make your move. No. I'm not gonna give you no reason to kill me, Manny. - Please don't. - Ok. I need some shoes, Manny. What we got? Shoes. Let there be shoes, man. I want that, Manny. I want that. Shit. I need some shoes, man. I need some... Manny. Check it out, man. Check it out. Take one for the stomach, give it here. Ooh, mama. That shit is fine. Ok. Come on. Let's go. Wait. Wait, man. I need shoes. I need shoes. I got shoes. I got shoes. I need socks... I got fucking socks. Give me a minute, man. Just a minute. Ok. - Let's get this. - Know where it's going? Anywhere's fine by me. I don't wanna ride to no parking lot. - Hey, look. Look here. - What? There's my limousine to Broadway. Why? - Why that one? - Cos I want it. We're moving, man. We're moving. Thank you, Jesus. Shit. Shit. Shit, we make a hell of a team, don't we, man? Don't we? Hey. That looks like Al's train. What in hell's he doing out there? He looks sick. Damn. Damn. Al. Better call the paramedics. Something's wrong. Take it easy, Manny. They know what they're doing. - Pulasky. Hello, Pulasky? - Pulasky. This is Cassidy. Al fell off the engine. He's dead. A runaway's coming your way on track two. What did you say? Four units. Stop them, for God sakes. - Speak up, Pulasky. - Ok. - Switch it to track 11. - I can't. It's too late. Central? Damn you, Central. Emergency. Pick up the goddamn phone. Ooh, boy. Would I like to have some of this here for dessert. To go. Hey, Ruby. Why don't you answer the phone? Hey, come on, Ruby. You're pretty enough. Aw, shit. Your ass is so lazy. I don't know why the fuck you got a job here. - Central. Dave Prince speaking. - Pulasky. Get me Barstow. - Hold it, Pulasky. - Hold it my ass. Where's Barstow? We got a big emergency. - We got four unmanned units. - What? I said we got runaway units. Four of them. They're headed this way. Ruby, go get Frank, now. Run. Come on. Goddammit, get moving. We got an emergency here. Hold it, Pulasky, ok? He's coming. It's the phone, Frankie. Frank. Frank, get your ass out here. We got a runaway on 11. Central? Where are you? Goddammit. I'm here. What's up? We got a runaway on track 11. Engineer fell off the train. - Sure nobody else is on board? - How the hell do I know? Its gone nine miles and getting faster. Nine miles? That's right. What are we gonna do? Hey, be quiet. Will you calm down? Look, what I want you to do is line her onto the main line on track one. Ok. Got it? I'll take things over from there. Right, Frank. Shit. This sucker is flying, Manny. Should've hooked it to those freight cars. Smile, man. We're free. Yeah. - You think so, huh? - Yeah. Hey, Manny. I want you to know I'm proud to be your deputy, partner. Look, kid, I appreciate what you done, but you ain't no kind of partner to me. Don't be proud of yourself. Look at them tattoos. They'll look really nice in a swimming pool in Acapulco. What'd I do to deserve this shit from you? You don't know nothing. Being around me is stupid. I'm at war with the world and everybody in it. And you're gonna get hurt. - I don't get you, man. - Rape boys usually are dumb. Rapo? I ain't no goddamn rapo, man. Where'd you get that from? It's on your rap sheet. Busted for rape two years ago. Shit, man. That was just statutory rape. She was 15 and I was older than her. That's good. Whoo. What's wrong? You dying for company? You think somebody'll be watching? I expect nothing. She's gaining speed fast. She'll hit your territory soon. Her brakes are burning up. Are you nuts? Her brakes have burnt off. How in the fuck did that happen? Didn't they check it? The throttle must be jammed wide open. Oh, damn. There she goes. Oh, God, man. What are we gonna do? I got a wife and two kids. I ain't got no money like Michael Jackson. - Come on, the system's foolproof. - Why? Because you designed it? That I did, my boy, and I know how to use it. Now, let me show you. We'd better fly over the highway. Are you serious? Jesus, those scum could never make it this far out. We're freezing our asses off for nothing. Shut up. Keep your eyes on the glacier. This guy. I'm telling you. He'd do the same thing I would do. Hey, I just thought about that bank that you ripped off in Reno. Whooee. I was in reform school. Man, that was so fucking great. Two million simoleons. Man, that was hot. Two million is a slight exaggeration. The insurance company. Standard procedure. Yeah, but it was still fucking great, man. I'll tell you what. Hey, Manny, I know this jug outside Frisco. It's good for half a mil. They handle payroll for SnA Sugar, and SnA Sugar is a big outfit, man. That's what I've been dreaming about, a really good score. Know what I mean? And I'm gonna party, ooh. Yeah. Shit. I'm gonna go to Mardi Gras, I'm gonna go to Vegas, and I'm gonna go with enough money in my hip pocket to catch some fine bitches. You know, I spend almost every night of my life dreaming about this kind of shit. - Dreaming? - Yeah. Dreaming. That's bullshit. You're not gonna do nothing like that. I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job. That's what you're gonna do, a little job. Some job a convict can get, like sweeping off trays in a cafeteria or cleaning toilets. And you're gonna hold on to that job like gold, because it is gold. Let me tell you, Jack, that is gold. You listening to me? And when that man walks in at the end of the day and he comes to see how you done, you ain't gonna look in his eyes. You'll look at the floor because you don't wanna see that fear in his eyes when you grab his face and slam him to the floor and make him cry for his life. So you look right at the floor. Pay attention to what I'm saying, motherfucker. And then he's gonna see how you done. He's gonna say "You missed a little spot over there." "You didn't get this one here. What about this little-bitty spot?" And you're gonna suck all that pain inside you and you're gonna clean that spot. And you're gonna clean that spot until you get that shiny clean. And on Friday you'll pick up your pay cheque. And if you could do that, you could be president of Chase Manhattan Corporations. If you could do that. Not me, man. I wouldn't do that kind of shit. I'd rather be in fucking jail. More's the pity, youngster. More's the pity. Could you do that kind of shit? I wish I could. I wish I could. Central. Central. Eastbound 12. Eastbound 12. - Barstow here. - Why did you stop us? There's a runaway coming at you on track one. Hear me? - Number 12, answer me. - I don't see any runaway. If you were close enough to see her, you'd be dead. Get it? She's four miles away. I want you to pull onto track two at once. Repeat, at once. My God. No, are you serious? Hey, Ruby, what's going on? Hey, hey, you can't go in there right now. Come on, Ruby. That eastbound 12 is crawling. Who's the incompetent bastard on her? Ask him to clear fast. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Didn't I tell you? I told you something was fucked up. Maybe we're on some express run. Wake up. We blew that caboose to hell. Something screwy is going on here. Look. Look. All the handrails are gone. - Maybe the engineer is croaked. - Engineers do not just croak. Why don't the whistle ever blow, huh? What are you, out of your mind? I just wanted to see if it worked. You said the engineer was croak... Let go. You think it's a cops-and-robbers game. Hey, man. You picked the train. - You're right. - Yeah. State police calling chopper one. State police calling chopper one. Come in. We have information on the escapees. Ranken, that's your radio. Railroad security found some prison clothes in a switch yard. Looks like prison brogans. - How'd they get so far? - What did I tell you? Tell them I'll be there in ten minutes. Have some officers ready. Roger, state police. We're on our way. Let's have some fun. Maybe we just oughta clear out of here. Maybe we just oughta jump for it. What do you say? We can break our necks anytime we want. Yeah. That makes sense. - Let's find out what's happening. - How we gonna do that? - Go up front and find out. - Yeah. Find out what's happening. Go up front and find out what the hell is going on. I want that, man. - What? - Tuck that in on you some place. All right. And wait till I give you the office before you attack. Yeah. Yeah. Ok. Hello, Mr MacDonald. Don't tell anyone about the runaway. We don't wanna panic the passengers. Besides, we've got the company's reputation to uphold. What's the latest? It went straight through the caboose of Granville 12. Well, anyone hurt? No. What's the story on the engineer? He had a heart attack, old fart. He made everyone bananas trying to keep that engine from going to scrap. Get that. - What's the speed? - About 70. Hey, Barstow, why don't you stop her? You put the system in. Cost the company $4.5 million. The system is designed to dispatch trains, not to stop them when they're unmanned. The brakes are out, the overspeed control must've gotten screwed up by the crash. But don't worry, Eddie. We'll do all we can to avoid more casualties. Don't forget about the Seneca bridge. Dave, get us some coffee. - What about the bridge? - I'm taking care of it. I'd like to remind you it's an old bridge. So what? Are you gonna get the coffee? Mr MacDonald, by the time that runaway reaches this bridge, it'll be doing 90. The restriction for that bridge is 50. Get her on the spur in Jordan. Derail her. Best idea, sir. I don't need you to tell me if I'm right. Derail her. I don't wanna lose the bridge. This system is designed so I can get everyone onto the siding. Meanwhile, we'll think of something else. Right now it's four engines, no people. If I let you jerk off with your system, this wild animal's gonna kill somebody. You know what that'll cost the company? Do you? Derail her. That's my order. You say derail, then we derail. But these people are witnesses. It's your decision, Eddie. Yeah. Yeah, it's my decision. Central calling Jordan. Central calling Jordan. Signal maintainer 40, this is an emergency. Signal maintainer 40, acknowledge. This is an emergency. Central calling Jordan. Signal maintainer 40, come in. Where the hell are you? Central calling Jordan. Jordan. Signal maintainer 40 here. Central here. There is an unmanned runaway heading west on track one. Line her into the siding. Use the manual switch, then get out of the way. Superintendent MacDonald wants to derail her. Got that? Mr Eddie MacDonald. I'll be goddamned. Son of a bitch. Oh. Hey, you hear that? Come on, Manny. Come on, Manny. See? See, I told you, man. I told you. I knew we had an engineer on this sucker. - You were right, kid. - I say blow, baby, blow. Boy, this is gonna be something. Huh? Signal maintainer 40 here at Jordan. Central. Listen, did I hear you right that that runaway is supposed to be unmanned? Yeah, that's right. Let me tell you something, mister. I think you're wrong. The whistle. The goddamn whistle's blowing. Derailing is out. Run, old man, run. Line her through. Somebody's blowing the whistle. You'd have killed him just like that. My God. Ok, next hurdle. Come on, big train. I'll slap your fat diesel ass. Come on. Do you like 'em, anchovies? I don't remember having any. Well, if you had 'em, you'd remember having 'em, man. I tell you what. - Get over here. - Yeah. What? - I don't think he saw us. - Ok. Ok. What do we do now? Let him come. When he gets two-thirds through that door, we'll nail him. - We ain't gonna kill him, are we? - No. Ok. Unless we have to. We'll find out what's going on. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, man. He's in trouble out there. Let's help him. Come on. Let's go help him, Manny. Down. Oh, man. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? I work on this train. - What are you doing here? - What are we doing here? I'll tell you what we're doing here. We're on our way to Las Vegas to see our close and personal friend, Wayne Newton. Why? Are you collecting tickets or something, sweetheart? Hey, sweetheart, how would you like a really good fuck, huh? Just try it. Just try it. Freeze on that bullshit. What happened to you? I was tired. I was taking a nap. I shouldn't have done it, but I did it. So what? My head got hit when we slammed into that caboose. I don't know what happened, but there's no engineer on this train. Nobody but us. She's lying. We heard the whistle. I blew the whistle. You're trying to get us busted. This runaway's gonna run into something fast. I climbed back here to the last engine where it's safer. Don't you get it? - I don't believe her bullshit. - You don't believe me? You just look out the window, you don't believe me. This train is out of control. My God, we can get killed. Then we'd better do something about it. What about the hostler helper? A woman. Goddammit. Does she know anything about running a locomotive? Shit. The only person on the whole train is a woman. How lucky can I get? Now what? The chief of security from Stonehaven. - I don't have time for him. - He says it's important. - He know about the runaway? - I don't think so. Good. Tell him we'll see him later. How far to the bridge? What's the ETA? 25 minutes. Shit. - Seneca station. - Go ahead. MacDonald from Central. A runaway's coming your way. Going over 80. - That's too fast for the bridge. - I know it's going too fast. Have your emergency crew together. Christ. Cant you stop it? We're gonna stop it. Have 'em there just in case. Asshole. It won't do a thing. Agh. I already tried it from the second engine. Why not? All I know is when a bunch of engines are hooked up together everything operates from the lead engine, you stop the lead engine, all of 'em stop. I don't believe this shit. We get out of a maximum security prison and wind up on an unmanned train with this bitch and bad news. - You guys bust out of Stonehaven? - Yeah. So what? Man, why'd you tell her that? You told her, clown. So what? She gonna drop a dime on us? No. Boy, I guess you guys picked the wrong train. How come you didn't go up to the lead engine? How come you come back here? You can't cross from the second to the first engine. It doesn't have a walkway. There's a door in front, but it must've jammed in the collision. Oh, man. What do we do now? You think they know about us? They do now, after we hit that caboose. If they woke up, there'd be pigs all over this thing whenever and wherever it stops. Ranken's all over this territory. Yeah. Maybe he'll find us. I ain't giving up. No matter who dies, I ain't giving him that pleasure. No fucking way. I don't wanna die, Manny. I ain't getting caught alive. And you neither. I don't know, man. I don't know nothing right now. I can't even think straight right now. Just do what I tell you and don't crap on yourself. I let you tag along to be a regular, not a piece of shit. What you're doing ain't nothing, man. We don't stand a chance if we jump out. I can't jump here. This is suicide. If you jump here, you're gonna break every bone in your body. Then what? - They've been broke before. - I'm with you, Manny. I'm with you till the wheels come off. - You can't go. - No? - You can't leave me alone here. - I don't care who jumps with me. I know how to stop the train. Why didn't you tell us that to start with? We probably can't stop it 100%, - but maybe we can slow it down. - You tell me how. If we can disconnect the electric cables between the engines, the engines'll shut down one at a time. Now, it's not gonna be easy. We... They'll be frozen and we don't have the right tools, but it's a better chance than jumping out. You better know what you're talking about. Don't threaten me. What's the matter with you? Come on, let's go. That one. - The one next to the coupling? - Yeah. Here. Take me up. You do it. You have two hands. - Ok. Hold on to me. - Use the wrench. Hey, I did it. I got it. Get me up. Get me up. I got it. Frank, look at this. Come look at this. Look at what? The runaway has slowed down. See? It's at 80, and still holding. It was 92 a couple of minutes ago. - I don't understand it. - The girl. She slowed it. It doesn't matter. 80, 180. The bridge won't take the train going that fast. - How far to the bridge now? - Five minutes. - Let's go. - Right. We can use the fire extinguisher. Right. Right. I lost it. She's coming. ETA's in about three minutes. Get me up. Argh. Manny. Manny. Get her, man. Get her. Argh. I got you. Hold my hand. Hold my hand. Grab my hand. Come on. Look. Look. Manny. Look, Manny. Look. Get me Central, quick. Oh, man. Oh, man. That's crazy. There are three people on the runaway. Holy shit. Where'd they come from? How do I know? We saved three lives. Not for long. Dave, will you give me a fucking break? I wish I could, but we've got five minutes to get the runaway off the main line, or there'll be a head-on with the Northeast Express. It's no big deal. We'll just head her into the 14. Great idea, Frank. Why don't you just send her to Elken's? So? No, no, no. That's the chemical plant. She won't make the curve at that speed. She'll flip and wipe out the whole plant. We'd better warn 'em. You know, girl, I oughta thank you. I mean, it's one thing to jump and wrap yourself around a tree or a pole. But to wind up spilt all over a ditch with a broken hip waiting for the bulls, what a waste. Yeah, man. You ain't kidding. Hey, look. We're almost there. Come on, Manny. Let's rip this fucker. - Is that the door? - It's jammed. I couldn't open it. Hey, don't you worry, sweetheart. We've been breaking through doors all our lives. Come on, man. You can't do it with that hand of yours. Let me help. - Let me in there. - I got it. You can't do it with that hand of yours. Shit. Shit. Bullshit. Take the first west at Macketsburg. Get onto the Bellport siding. Get the emergency crew in and evacuate the plant. Get 'em as far away as possible. You got ten minutes, if you're lucky. Get off my back, woman. Mr Barstow, I have two very dangerous prisoners on the loose. I don't give a shit if your whole prison's loose. I got a killer train on my hands with three people on board, and no free tracks left. So do me a fucking favour and get lost, or I'll have your ass kicked out. On the double. You keep an eye on her. I'm gonna go take a leak. Argh. I hope you don't like it and want to do something about it. Yeah, I didn't think you wanted to back up that loud conversation. Wipe that piss off your face. I don't wanna hear any more crap out of you. If I don't get my convicts back, the prison will be out of control. You know what a riot in a maximum security prison looks like? Your brains are too small to imagine it. - Now, where's the train? - Track one. I'm gonna kick your teeth in. You're playing with me. Tell me straight. Got it? Tell me how to find it with a helicopter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll show you. I'll be goddamned if I've come all this way to get stuck by some goddamn door. Shit. Don't give up now. We're gonna make it through this. How? - I don't know. - Yeah. But I know the people are clearing the tracks, and I know that they won't abandon us. - How do you know that? - I just feel it in my heart. There are miracles. You're stupid. You know how stupid you sound? Miracle, my ass. One must count on oneself. Nobody else. You think I'm waiting around for a miracle to happen? I ain't waiting for no miracle. I'm going out and around. Out and around. I'm going there. That's where I'm going. You can't make it. There's nothing to hold on to out there. There's no walkways. I told you, you can't make it. I'll make it. If I have to fly the five feet, like a birdie, I'll fly it. I'll make it. Hey, Manny, you can't do it, not with that arm of yours. But I can do it. I can whip this fucker. So, give me a drink. Let me go for it. All right. Hey, sucker. Lighten up. Ooh. - You are so brave. - Yeah, I know it. Ok. Ok. Goggles. Yeah, goggles. I'm going. Here I go. Hey, Manny? Partners? Yeah. Fucking A. Fucking A. Ok. Ok. You can make it. You can make it, Buck. You got guts, kid. You got real guts. More guts than brains. - What did you say? - No brains. No brains. - That's mean. - That's the truth. Come on, Buck. Let's go. Let's go, sucker. - Now. Make it now. Jump for it. - He's gotta come back. - Go for it, sucker. Come on. - I can't watch. Then... sit down. Don't give up on me, sucker. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't give up. Aagh. Don't quit, sucker. Get out there. He can't do it. Don't you care about him? Doesn't his life mean anything to you? - Get outta here. - Agh. Get back, punk. You wanna be a tough guy? You want a deal like this? Go back. Let him in. What are you doing, Manny? Show me you ain't got shit for blood. - Give me a break. - Oho. Get out there now. Don't you talk to me. I don't know who you are. You wanna be a tough guy? Get the fuck outta here. Get out. - No. No. Stop it. - You wanna kill me, or what? If I wanted to punch your ticket, you'd be long gone. You can do it. I'm telling you you can do it. I can't do it, Manny. I can't do it. You don't know what you could do, what you can't. You're a coward. Why'd I break out with a chicken? Get up. - Leave him alone. - Show me some, kid. - Get the fuck up. You hear me? - Stop it. Get the fuck up. No. No. Get the fuck outta here. - Ok. - No. - Ok. - No. No. Ok. Ok. Ok. I'm going. No. No, he's using you. He's using you. Don't go. - You gonna do what I tell you? - Yeah. You're gonna do it. Do it yourself, if you're so brave. - I would if I had two hands. - Bullshit. You think you can sacrifice someone else's life instead of your own? You're an animal. No. Worse. Human. Human. Get the fuck out there. Now. Get out. Do it. Get out. I'm not letting you go. No. No. Argh. Don't you touch her. I'll kill you, Manny. I'll kill you. - You die, sucker. You die. - I'll kill you, Manny. Don't make me kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you, Manny. Don't make me kill you. I'll kill you. Come at me, I'll kill you. Aaargh. Aaargh. Drop the shiv. Don't make me kill you. I'll beat you to fucking death. Come on, Manny. Try me. Try me. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Oh, Manny... I thought you was my friend. I thought we was partners. Shit. You know, you're worse than Ranken, when the truth comes out. At least he's upfront with his bullshit. You was a hero. You was a hero to all of us back in that shithole. Goddamn. Oh, Manny. Manny... It's your mess, Frank. You should've listened to me and derailed her. What do we do? Shunt 'em onto the siding and in 15 minutes they run out of track? - Elken station. Elken station. - Elken. Go ahead. - Gilchrist, this is MacDonald. - Yes, MacDonald. - Barstow here. - Come on. Now listen carefully and act fast. You have about one minute to line the runaway under the old spur. - You got it. - Good, good, good. Good boy. We'll save the chemical plant, huh? We're still gonna lose those three people. There are still a lot of beaming faces at NASA headquarters in Houston today over Wednesdays successful launch of the two new communications satellites. The number of sophisticated experiments will apparently be doubled on next months launch of an Anglo-French weather satellite. Launch director Hogan praised the crew of the just-completed mission... I still don't understand. How did this happen? Why couldn't we stop it, with all this junk? I mean, with all this high technology. Some things can't be explained. Look. Holy shit. See that, Ranken? You see that? Come on, Ranken. You'll never take me back, Ranken. Try it. You're never gonna be allowed, sucker. What's the matter, Ranken? You got no fucking guts? No guts. No guts, Ranken. You hear me? You'll never stop this train, you hear me, Ranken? You'll never stop it. You hear me, sucker? I told you. You hear me, Ranken? I told you I'd break free. I done it. Here I am, right in your face, sucker. Come on down. I won. I won. I want you down, Ranken. Come on down. I'm alive, sucker. Come on down, Ranken. Ranken, you hear me? You hear me? You'll never get me. You'll never stop this train. Never. Never. You understand? I won. I won. I won. What was that? What was that? Huh? - What happened? What happened? - They gave up on us. They switched us off the main track onto a dead end. - What does that mean? - We're gonna crash any minute. Huh. Hold me. I don't wanna die alone. We're gonna be all right. We're gonna be fine. We all die alone. Come on, Ranken. Come on, sucker, here I am. Come on. I'm out of my cage now. I'm out, out of my cage. I'm never going back. Never. You'll never stop me. Never. I'm out. You hear me? You can't get across, Manny. I'm out of my cage. You'll never stop me. You're gonna learn, kid. It's all up here. I'll cross the stinking thing. I'll cross it. I'll cross it. Watch me. Aaaaargh. Waiting for ya. Is Jonah alive? Is Jonah alive? Yes. Yes. That's good. He'll be glad. Don't do it, Manny. You'll burn for it. You know you will. Push the button. We're on a dead-end siding. We're gonna crash in five minutes. Then we'll have a nice five-minute ride together. You think you're a hero, huh? Shit. You're scum. We're both scum, brother. You're going to push that button and stop this train. We've only got a few minutes. We got all the time in the world. - You'll die, bastard. - You'll die with me. Fuck you. You're as afraid to die as anybody else. And I never let you free, you hear me? I am free, Ranken. I am free. You think you won. I know how to die too. Win, lose. What's the difference? What about that punk and the girl? No, no. It's just you and me. Manny. Shut it down. Manny, goddammit. Shut it down, Manny. Manny. Shut it down. That's all you gotta do. Manny. He knows what he wants to do. Manny. Shut it down. That's all you gotta do. Shut it down, Manny. Shut it down. Shut it down, goddammit. That's all you gotta do, Manny. Shut it down. Manny. He did it. He did it.
