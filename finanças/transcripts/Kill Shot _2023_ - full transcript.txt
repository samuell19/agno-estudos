(Jackson breathing heavily) - I'm just hanging around. - Well, I've got a client here looking for a guy for an elk hunt. Uh, would you be interested in coming up to the lodge? - Yeah, I could use the work. Wife's been bugging me to book something. - Ah, perfect. Um, opening day is Saturday. I'll see you at the lodge. Book you in the same hotel as usual. - Thanks, I'll see you at the lodge.

You said you weren't- - What the fuck, this guy? - coming home till tomorrow. - You fucking kidding me? This guy? Wait you fucking- - are you kidding? - What are you doing? - What the fuck is your problem? - My problem? What is your problem? Oh, you had no idea? - Oh, my God. - You had no idea? (head thudding) You had no idea? - What the fuck is wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? - Are you fucking serious? - You're my wife. - Oh, my God. It doesn't feel like it because every fucking day leave me here. And then you go off into the fucking mountains by yourself. What do you expect? - [Robby] Let me go, man. - You're a freak, honey. - I expect you to act like my wife. - We died with Haley. We died. - I wish, I wish that I died with Haley. - You're so fucking sad. You're so fucking sad. Take your Goddamn wedding ring. I am so done. - We're not done. (metal clanging) - We are so done. (skillet thudding) (dramatic music) - [Radio DJ] Good morning, Montana, a small plane crash just south of the Canadian border last night. Officials believe there was no survivors, and only the pilot was killed. In other news, opening of hunting season is just two days away with temps looking to drop. It should be a good one.

(hand thudding) Are ya all right? I'm a little worried about ya. - Murph, hey. (Murph clears throat) - And, uh, what happened to the moosh there? - Nothing. - None of my business. But, uh, that reminds me of a joke the old man told me when I was a kid. Guy gets in the subway train. He's got a black eye. Sits down next to another guy, and the other guy's got a black eye. And he says to him, uh, "Hey, buddy, how'd you get your black eye?" And he goes, uh, "Uh, I was looking to go on vacation. So, I went into a travel agency, and, uh, here's this hottie blonde with a big rack and a tight sweater. I wanna ask her for two tickets to Pittsburgh. And I ended up asking her for two pickets to Tittsburgh." (Murph laughing) Uh, he looks at at him, and he goes, "How'd you get your black eye?" "I came down to sit at the breakfast table, and the wife asked me what I'd like to have, and what I wanted to say was, 'A bowl of Post Toasties,' but what I ended up saying was, 'You fucking whore, you've ruined my life.'" (Murph laughing) (hand thudding) (Murph and Jackson laughing) - That's a good one. That is a good one, Murph. The last time you told it to me, the last time, they were on a bus, but I think, I think the subway, subway is much, much better. (Murph laughing) Way better. - Oh, I know. Ah. Hey, anyway, I heard what happened at your house with that little asshole, Robby. That wasn't right. Let me tell you, that little douchebag, I fucking taught him everything he knows about service work, heating, plumbing, all right? You want me to take him out behind a plumbing shop and straighten his ass out, I'll fucking do that. - No, look. Appreciate it, okay? It's my life, my problem. I'll take care of it. - [Murph] Hey, you gimme the word, I'll take him out back and get all Jersey all over his shit. - It's all good. - We all right with that? I'm sorry about that. (glasses clinking) ♪ I got down on my knees, and I prayed, but they won ♪ (glasses thudding) Anyway, I'm supposed to pick up this guy coming in from Canada, and God knows where he is.

(engine revving) (dramatic music continues) (mellow music) (door squeaking) (footsteps plodding) (Jackson sighs) (hands thudding) (bell ringing) - Who'd you piss off? - You know, usual story. You know, came down to breakfast, and wife asked me what I wanted. I wanted to tell her I'd like a bowl of cereal, but instead, I said, "You fucking whore. You ruined my life (laughs)." She, uh, she smacked me. - Well, good to see you haven't changed much. - Yeah, how are the elk doing? - Oh, they're still up high. It's been pretty warm. Should be coming down soon, though. - Hope my guy likes walking. - Client's not a guy. - What? (door squeaking) (bells ringing) - [Bill] There she is. (latch clicking) (footsteps plodding) - Hi. I'm Kate. - Jackson. (crickets chirping) (mellow music) - My father always wanted to take me hunting, but he never did it. When he passed, I felt it would be a good way to connect. So, I made the jump and moved to Montana. I don't even have an apartment yet. I've been staying at that motel. (hooves clopping) (Kate laughs) I'm riding with his ashes. I'd like to spread them when we get an elk. It's funny the things we regret when a loved one dies. It's hard to connect when you've lost someone. - Hunting isn't about talking. - Thought we were just riding to high camp. - We are, and we're gonna do it quietly. Animals know when they're being hunted, so pretty please with sugar on top- - Shut the fuck up? (mellow music continues) (crickets chirping) - That's your tent over there. Make yourself comfortable. I'll get the horses settled in, and then I'll start on dinner. Pull out your rain gear. I'll put it in my pack for tomorrow, cut down on your weight. We're gonna be putting down a lot of miles. (Jackson exhales) Never gets old. (mellow music continues) (zipper whizzing) (tent rustling) (gentle music) - [Commando] This is alpha one. I'm on the northern ridge side. No indication of the pilot yet. (static hissing) (walkie-talkie beeps) - This is whiskey seven. I've got nothing to your six. I'm moving to your position. (wind howling) - This is tango leader. We've got nothing in the third or fourth quadrant. (suspenseful music) (wood thudding) (fire crackling) - So, sun up tomorrow's it 7:56. Means the first legal shot's 7:41. We wanna be in position 7:15 latest. It's about hour walk to get there, so breakfast 5:30. (crickets chirping) (Jackson sniffs) - I'd like to split up to cover more ground. - No. - Why not? (fire crackling) - Because this is a guided hunt. (Kate sighs) Can't split up. - But wouldn't we have a better shot of getting an elk? - I'm not hunting. I'm guiding. - What's the difference? - I'm here to keep you safe and, um, take care of your needs. (fire crackling) - I like the sound of that. - There's grizzlies, okay? You could cross into Canada. You could accidentally shoot an illegal animal. (Jackson sniffs) - Are we that close to Canada? An illegal animal? - Yeah. You know the difference between a brown-tined bull and a spike bull? Or, how about what side of the creek section 314 ends and 317 begins, making it illegal to shoot a cow? Or, what are you gonna do, shoot a bull, runs off into somebody's private field, hmm? - A spike bull is an elk with antlers that do not branch. You can't shoot a bull east of Mill Creek. And if your cow end's up in a private field this far out, you should be a better shot. Just 'cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I don't know shit, 'kay? If you have something to say, say it. - Well, I look forward to showing you an adventure. (cup clanking) - I bet you will. (Jackson sniffs) - You know, just 'cause you read a book about it or you know, watched a hunting show doesn't mean anybody can do this. - That is why I hired you. (clothes rustling) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) (zipper whizzing) (tent rustling) (fire crackling) (coyote howling) (fire crackling) (dramatic music continues) (Sarah laughing) - [Hailey] I put it right here. - It's pretty good. I like that. (latch clicking) (door squeaking) - Look, Hailey, Daddy's got the ball. - Throw me the ball. Throw me the ball. (Jackson laughs) - Okay, ready? (engine humming) (upbeat music) Here it comes. (ball thudding) Oh, yes. - Yeah. - Nice job. - Again, again. (engine humming) ♪ Just started something ♪ (upbeat music) (hand thudding) - All right, here comes a deep pass. (upbeat music continues) (hand thudding) (ball thudding) No. (engine humming) (brakes screeching) - Oh, my God. (car thudding) (horn beeping) (dramatic music) (sirens wailing) (horn beeping) (dramatic music continues) (fire crackling) (Jackson sighs) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) (footsteps plodding) (elk squealing) (leaves rustling) - Sh. (elk squealing) Did you hear 'em? They're right up there. We're gonna go, but go really quietly. (footsteps plodding) (leaves rustling) (dramatic music continues) (elk squealing) Sh. (leaves rustling) Sh. (dramatic music continues) (Jackson sighs) It's funny, we, we know they're so close, but they can feel the pressure, and they just, just move on. - We should split up. - Not a chance. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) - Up. - Yeah, it's pretty big. You know, grizzly bears in this area actually run towards gunshots. - Why? - Because they've learned it's usually a hunter's kill, trying to get a nice, easy meal before hibernation. - Ah. - Come on. That thing doesn't wanna have anything to do with us. (dramatic music) (footsteps plodding) (wind howling) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) Look at that. - [Kate] What is it? - It's a print. - Elk? - Yeah, looks pretty fresh. (dramatic music continues) Come on. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) Might be something up there. (Kate sighs) - I'm too tired. It's getting late. We've been at it for 10 hours. - Okay, I'm gonna go to the top of the ridge. If there's a herd of elk up there, at least we'll know for tomorrow. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (grass rustling) (dramatic music continues) (bag rustling) (wind howling) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (gun clanking) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (parachute rustling) (briefcase clanking) (dramatic music continues) (parachute rustling) (dramatic music continues) (briefcase clanking) (parachute rustling) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (gunshots blasting) (footsteps plodding) (footsteps plodding) (gun clanking) Kate. (dramatic music continues) Kate. (Jackson grunting) What happened? You okay? - I took a shot at a bull. - What? - A bull elk, I took a shot, and I missed. Did you see anything up there? - Me? Uh, yeah, I, I saw a bull out, too. (dramatic music continues) - Guess we should start here tomorrow. - Yeah, yeah. (metal clanging) (Jackson exhales) We still gotta drop your dad off. - What? - The ashes in the urn. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right, let's, uh, let's get back to camp. (dramatic music continues) - [Kate] So, what got you into hunting? - Well, I dunno. I had the experience. (dramatic music continues) (Jackson exhales) (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) So, tell me, did you really come out here to shoot an elk, spread your father's ashes, start a new life in Big Sky Country? - Daddy wasn't cut out to be a dad. (Kate sighs) I'd like to say he did his best, but he didn't. I wanted to come up here to truly put him to rest. (fire crackling) I, I hope we will tomorrow. (clothes rustling) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (Jackson exhales) (dramatic music) - Stop pushing me away, Jackson. I won't let you do this to me, to us. We can get through this together. We can be there for each other. You just, you gotta let me in. - There's a part of me that's missing, a part of me that never came back and died. And every day, I, I wait for it to come back. Then, every day, I'm disappointed because there it is just waving at me, reminding me, taunting me. (Jackson sighs) (hands thudding) - But what? (Jackson sighs) But what, Jackson? You say you wanna be here with me, to be here now, so do it. I lost Haley, too. (fire crackling) We can get through all of this together, you and me. We can do this. You gotta trust me. We can make it through all of this together. You need to trust me. (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) (liquid sloshing) (container thudding) (bandage rustling) (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (dog barking) (crickets chirping) (fire crackling) (zipper whizzing) (tent rustling) (footsteps plodding) - Got colder last night. - Try some pants. - No, it's all right. It reminds me of boarding school in Russia. - You went to boarding school in Russia? - Da. I told you I'm full of surprises. Can I get some coffee? - Yeah, you gotta grind it. (coffee thudding) - All right. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) (dispatcher speaking indistinctly) (footsteps plodding) - [Dispatcher] Suspect is armed. (dramatic music continues) (utensil clinking) (bird squawking) - [Commando] All right, no sudden moves. Everyone move in slowly. (dramatic music continues) (grinder churning) (gunshots blasting) - Get down, down. (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) - [Dina] Be advised target is engaged. (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) (Kate grunts) (gunshots blasting) - Stay down. (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) (gun clanking) (gunshot blasting) (footsteps plodding) We gotta go. - My father's urn. - You'll end up in an urn. Come on. (Kate coughs) (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) (dispatcher speaking indistinctly) - [Soldier] Good. (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (soldier grunting) - Take the shot. Do it. (soldier grunting) (knife slashing) (soldier grunting) (knife slashing) (soldier grunting) (gunshots blasting) (soldiers grunting) (dramatic music continues) - Jackson. - Gun. (gun thudding) (gunshots blasting) (soldier grunting) (body thudding) (dramatic music continues) Let's go. (equipment rustling) Now. (footsteps plodding) - Target's on foot, one male, one female. Package presumed to be with targets. Intercept and neutralize. - [Commando] Copy that, Dina. We're in pursuit. (engines revving) - [Jackson] Stay with me. (footsteps plodding) - [Kate] What's happening? - [Jackson] Go, go. - [Kate] What's going on? - [Jackson] Keep moving. - [Kate] Jackson, stop. - [Jackson] They're coming. - Jackson, stop. I need pants. I need pants. Jackson. - Shit. (bag rustling) I got your rain pants in mine. (engines revving) - Who are those guys? (zipper whizzing) What's going on? - This is bad. This is my fault. (bag rustling) - Why are they shooting at us? (equipment clanking) - I found a case full of money yesterday. (dramatic music continues) - [Kate] You what? - Up in that deer stand on top of the ridge line. There was a dead guy in a parachute. In his hand was a submachine gun, and at his feet, there was a case full of money. - Yeah, right. (dramatic music continues) (engine revving) (equipment clattering) (latches clicking) (dramatic music continues) (briefcase clattering) (lid thudding) - We gotta get outta here. (engines revving) I ruined your hunt. (bag rustling) - You ruined my hunt? You saved my life. - I never should have opened the case. They wouldn't have chased us. - Just get me outta here alive. We can split the money. (engines revving) (dramatic music continues) - All right, that's a deal. (engines revving) - What are we gonna do? - Kill 'em. (dramatic music continues) (phone ringing) - Go. - Targets were engaged but able to escape. In pursuit now. Package presumed to be with them. - What do you mean presumed? - It's with them. We'll get it. - Very good, send me your coordinates. - I said we'll get it. It'll be had. - Send me your coordinates. I'm gonna get you your money back. (phone beeping) (engine humming) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) - There's no out running dirt bikes. How good of a shot are you? - What do you mean? - I got a plan. (strap rustling) Come on. (footsteps plodding) - I really hate your plan. - If they stop, I'll give 'em the bag. If they don't, you shoot 'em. - What if they just shoot you? - It's hard to get a clean shot from a moving bike. - What if they stop and then shoot you? (engines revving) - Well, let's just hope I can draw quicker than them. (dramatic music continues) (Kate exhales) (footsteps plodding) (engines revving) (water splashing) (engines revving) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (engines humming) (guns clanking) - Drop the bag. Hands in the air. (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) - You're crazy (laughs). (bag rustling) - Jackson. - Drop the gun. Drop the bag. Drop that gun. I'll blow her head off. - Okay, all right, just tell me what you want me to do first. - You heard what I said. Just do it. - Okay, I'm really bad at directions. - Just drop the- - Look, you got a gun at my friend's head. You just tell me what you want me to do first. - Don't be stupid. You heard me. (bag rustling) (gunshot blasting) (soldier grunts) - Let's do mine. Let's do it my way. - You are crazy. - [Commando] Alpha one to Dina, target's engaged on North Road. Permission to engage. (dramatic music continues) - Excellent, kill them and retrieve the package. (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (gunshots blasting) (gun clanking) (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) (gun clanking) (dramatic music continues) (gunshots blasting) (bird squawking) (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) - Jackson, on your right. (gunshots blasting) (commando grunting) (gunshots blasting) (footsteps plodding) - You okay? - I'm fine. - Okay, let's go. - Who are you really? - On your feet, let's go. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) (footsteps plodding) (equipment clanking) Those aren't for this. Listen, we need to get some cover and get off this mountain. - Who are you really? - I'm just a hunting guide trying to get you down safe. I think you should go down alone, all right, no pack, no money, no reason to bother you. It'll be safer. - Absolutely not, I'd die on that trail. - Yeah? Well, you may die up here. - I am not walking on foot through grizzly bear-infested woods while a bunch of paramilitary guys with machine guns shoot at me. I trusted you to take me up here. You need to get me out, too. Who are you? (gun clanking) - That is an MDRX bullpup assault rifle, suppressed and chambered in 308, has a multidynamic firing system between semi-automatic and fully automatic modes. It weighs 8.7 pounds. The firing mechanics are all located behind the trigger. The purpose of this design gives the MDRX a shorter overall length than a conventional rifle of a similar barrel length. It comes in four main variants, 223, 308, 6.5 Creedmoor, and 300 Blackout. This, this is a custom-made assault rifle chambered in a NATO 556 round. These guys, these guys are pros. (Kate sighs) I was a Navy Seal for most of my life. We stepped into something really bad. - So, military operatives are trying to kill us? - They probably just want the money. - What if they don't just want the money? What if they wanna kill you because you know about the money? - We, we know about the money. So, what do you say? I'll get you on that trail. You can go down alone. It'll be safer for you. - You're not hearing me. Trust me. I need you. Please. - I don't do that. - What? - Trust. (Kate sighs) - If, if I'm going down the mountain, it's with you. If I'm gonna die, it's not gonna be at the hands of some gunman or a bear. I'm staying with you. - Okay. I'm your guide. I'll get you out of this alive. (dramatic music) (footsteps plodding) Let's go. - This isn't the way we came, is it? - Nope, it's a back way. I'm hoping not to run into anyone. - Hate to burst your bubble. (dramatic music continues) - [Jackson] Go, go, go. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (gun clanking) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) - We're trapped. We should go back. - No, no. We can ascend it. - What? - I can climb it. - You're gonna rock-climb it with an automatic weapon strapped to you and a backpack? - No, that would be ridiculous. - [Kate] Then what? - You're gonna have the pack. I'm gonna go up, and I'll bring you up. (zipper whizzing) If we can gain the knife-blade ridge, we can get to the truck really fast, long as nobody falls. - And that sounds better? (gun clanking) (dramatic music continues) - [Jackson] I don't like this. - What is it? - If you can't see the target, you become the target. (dramatic music continues) We're being hunted. (gun clanking) We gotta get up this wall. (bags rustling) (crickets chirping) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) 'Kay. (zipper whizzing) When the rope goes tight, it means you're on belay. - What does that mean? - When the rope goes tight, you start climbing up. - And if I fall, I'm safe? - I'm only giving you a hip belay. Don't fall. (clothes rustling) (feet thudding) (Jackson grunting) (Kate sighs) (Jackson grunting) (dramatic music continues) (Jackson grunting) (Kate sighs) (dramatic music continues) (Jackson grunting) - Drop the pack and put your hands in the air. (Kate grunting) (soldier grunting) (elbow thudding) (body thudding) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (rope whizzing) - Watch the rope. (rope whizzing) (feet thudding) (rope whizzing) (soldier grunting) (Kate grunting) (body thudding) (rope whizzing) (Kate grunting) (dramatic music continues) (Kate grunting) (foot thudding) (soldier grunting) (knee thudding) (footsteps plodding) (rope whizzing) - Ow. (gunshots blasting) (footsteps plodding) (gunshots blasting) (water sloshing) (gunshots blasting) (soldier grunting) (gunshots blasting) (soldier grunting) (body thudding) (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) - Jackson, pull me up. (dramatic music continues) (Kate breathing heavily) (grunting) Oh, shit. - That's it. Keep coming. I've got you. (Kate grunting) Did you get hit? - I think it grazed me. - You're gonna sit down. Hold on. (Kate gasping) (footsteps plodding) Where'd you learn to fight like that? - [Kate] I told you. I'm full of surprises. - Okay. - My dad wanted a boy, so he made me take mixed martial arts. (Kate sighs) Look, I don't think you got a direct hit on that guy. - Yeah. How's your leg? - [Kate] It hurts. - All right, let me have the pack. (both breathing heavily) - You don't trust me? - Look, I need to get a look at the leg. (clothes rustling) (Jackson grunting) - Here. (zipper whizzing) Here. (zipper whizzing) Try it this way. (belt clanking) (dramatic music continues) How's it look? (dramatic music continues) (Kate moaning) How's it look? - It just grazed you. Let me have the pack. - The pack? - Yeah. There's a first aid kit in the pack. (bag rustling) We gotta stash the case. (zipper whizzing) - You wanna hide a case full of money in the woods after everything we've been through? (Jackson breathing heavily) - Look, you're hit. This case, it's just gonna slow us down. We stand a much better chance of surviving if it's not on us. - I'm not hit. It grazed me. (hand thudding) (Jackson breathing heavily) (bag rustling) (zipper whizzing) (clothes rustling) - You trust me? - I trust you. - Good. (bag rustling) (zipper whizzing) I know just the place. (bag rustling) Come on. (dramatic music) Watch your step. (footsteps plodding) - (sighs) What's your plan? - We're gonna hide the case in that tree. - What? - You'll see. (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) Okay. (zipper whizzing) Hold this. Okay. (gun clanking) I'm gonna go up the tree. I'm gonna drop this rope down to the bottom. You're gonna tie it to the case. I'm gonna pull it up, 'kay? You watch. - Really? - Yeah, it's gonna work. - All right. (dramatic music continues) (Jackson grunting) - Rope's coming down. (dramatic music continues) You got it? - Yeah. - Okay, tie it to the pack. (briefcase clattering) You good? - Yeah. (briefcase thudding) - [Jackson] All right, I'm gonna pull it up. - Okay. (briefcase clattering) (dramatic music continues) - [Jackson] It worked. - Genius. (dramatic music continues) Think we'll see that case again? (bag rustling) - I hope so. All right, the sun's going down. We're a couple miles from my truck. All right, let's go. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (Jackson breathing heavily) - What are you doing? - I'm gonna throw the pack in the river. That way, if they find it, it's far away from us and the money. (bag thudding) You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You cold? - I'm fine. - All right, we gotta keep moving. Let's go. (dramatic music continues) (leaves rustling) (dramatic music continues) That's one heck of a view. (Kate exhales) (dramatic music continues) These guys are like the freaking plague. (gun clanking) Come on, come on. Keep up. (gunshots blasting) Come on, keep up. - Easy for you to say, Mr. Navy Seal. I don't usually spent my time running around the mountain at altitude being chased by a maniac. (gunshots blasting) - Yeah, well, now you know what feels like to be an elk. So, next time I take you hunting, you'll have new insight into how to stalk a bull, and you'll be able to get yourself one. - Assuming there is a next hunt. - I got one more trick on my sleeve. Come on. (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) - This is your plan, getting us killed? No way, I don't do water. You should just kill them. - Yeah? Do you wanna stay here and die, or do you wanna live? (gunshots blasting) (water splashing) (Kate screaming) (water sloshing) (Kate gasping) (water sloshing) (dramatic music continues) Okay, there's a rapid ahead. (gunshot blasting) Stay on me. (gunshot blasting) (water sloshing) Here we go. Stay calm. (water sloshing) (dramatic music continues) Hold your breath. (water sloshing) (Jackson gasping) (Kate screaming) (water roaring) (dramatic music continues) - [Kate] Jackson, Jackson. Jackson, where are you? (water sloshing) (dramatic music continues) - They're in the river, headed down. Fan out. Search the banks and any possible egress points. (dramatic music continues) (water sloshing) - Jackson. Jackson. Jackson. (water splashing) (Jackson gasping) - You okay? - Great. Never been better. (Jackson gasping) - [Jackson] At least you're alive. Look on the bright side. Most tourists pay hundreds of dollars to float that river. You got it for free. (Jackson gasping) - Most tourists do it in a raft and don't almost die. - Yeah, well, I never said I was a rafting guy. Now, listen, we gotta get outta here. We bought us some time but not a lot. Let's go. (water sloshing) (dramatic music continues) (wind howling) (footsteps plodding) - Jackson, it's so cold. - I know. Come on. - We gotta get outta here. - We're almost there. Keep moving. Come on. Don't quit. Come on. (wind howling) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) Okay, okay. - What's the plan? - We're gonna take this road back to the trailhead, and my truck, it's about four miles. - Four miles? - Yep, yep, we're gonna move fast on this road, get back to my truck. I got some toys that'll even the odds. (footsteps plodding) (engine humming) Well, I'll be. Guess we won't have to walk all the way after all. Come on. (footsteps plodding) (engine humming) You good? It's a friend of mine. (engine humming) (brakes squeaking) (brakes hissing) (door clattering) - Jackson, what are you doing way the fuck out here? (Jackson laughs) - Was on a hunt. Uh, our horses got spooked and left us on foot. We were walking back to my truck. Do you think we could, uh, catch a ride? - Yeah, my passenger's seat had that fire, though. Jump in the back. There's plenty of room. - Murph, this is Kate, my client. - What are you doing with a roughneck like him way the fuck out here, sweetie? (Kate laughs) - He's not so bad. - All right, come on. Jump in the back. (footsteps plodding) (metal clanging) (door clattering) (wrench thudding) (Jackson grunting) Get up and in the back, sweetie. Get up and in there with your boyfriend. Get up. Get in. Lemme see your hands. Get up and in there. Lay down. (metal clanging) (dramatic music) - Jackson. Jackson, Jackson. Jackson. (footsteps plodding) - Oh, here's the cute couple, huh? How you doing, honey? You gonna tell Uncle Murph where that money is now? (hand slapping) - Don't touch me. I told you I don't know where Jackson put the money. - Huh? Come on, tell Uncle Murph where the money is. - I just came up here to go hunting and spread my father's ashes. - Oh, were you daddy's little girl? Where's the money? (Jackson groaning) Where's the money? - Eat shit. - Oh, honey, I need a yard of your shit to kiss your asshole. Where's the fucking money? - I told you I don't know. - You lizard-brained bitch. (foot thudding) You're gonna to tell me sooner or later. - [Jackson] No. - Oh, look who's waking up? Oh, Jackson. (Jackson groaning) Look who's waking up? (hand slapping) Jackson, Jackson, come on. Wake up now. Time to talk to Uncle Murph. (hand thudding) Hey, Jackson, come on. Wake up. Time to talk to Uncle Murph, buddy. Come on. Come on, Jackson. We're gonna go have a nice talk now. (dramatic music) (case thudding) Oh, Jackson. (knives clinking) Time to wake up, Jackson. (knives clinking) Hey, Jackson. (hand thudding) Jackson, wake the fuck up. (knives clinking) Where's the fucking money, Jackson? Where's the fucking money? (knife slapping) (Jackson grunting) (Jackson gasping) You know, Jackson, I never thought that this would be where I'm coming outta retirement. I always thought a couple months you'd come looking for me, and I'd have to pick up the tools just to tie up some loose ends. I never really thought that I'd be coming around here chasing you. Ain't life a fucking bitch? Now, where's the fucking money, Jackson? - Where's the girl? - I've already questioned her, and she didn't come across with anything whatsoever. That's the only reason you're still alive. Where is the motherfucking money? (dramatic music continues) You know, it's been a while, but it's like riding a bike. (knives clinking) I'll just pick it right up where I left off. Where is the fucking money? (hand thudding) (Jackson grunting) Where is the fucking money? - Oh, I'm sure you still know how to do your job, Murph. Those skills, once you learn 'em, they're kinda hard to forget. Believe me, I tried. Never saw it coming. - Well, you know, I had to do a little role-playing out here in the country, you know? I mean, I really did. I really liked it, too. You know, I shoulda been an actor. That pilot, Nate, he was a friend of mine. I was supposed to pick him up at the border. What'd you do, take a sack of money off a dead guy, (laughing) you sick fuck? (Murph laughing) Ah, I woulda done the same fucking thing, Jackson. Don't get me wrong. I like you and the people out here. I also like $100 million, and some Mai Tais, and some strippers on the beach, huh? That would be nice. - I know what you mean, Murph. (dramatic music continues) So, how's this gonna go Murph, huh? (knives clinking) You gonna torture me, make me talk? - Yeah, something just like that. But you know, we could save all that mess. All you gotta do is tell me where the fucking money is. That's all, and then it'll end a little differently, all right? (knife thudding) - Tell you what, Murph. (dramatic music continues) This life's kicked my ass. My daughter dies. My wife cheats on me. Got (laughs) more bills than I got fucking money. My body's old and broken. (dramatic music continues) - Oh, poor Jackson. You're really gonna make me lose some sleep over your life? Come on. I need to know where that fucking money is. Are we seeing eye to eye, big boy? - But ain't muscle memory a funny thing, Murph? Yeah, muscle memory. You know when you do something, no matter how long it's been since you done it, the body remembers how to do it. Yeah, you know, like take, uh, picking a lock for example. - What? (dramatic music continues) (chain clanking) (fist thudding) (Murph grunting) (body thudding) (dramatic music continues) - Now, we see eye to eye, Murph. (chain clanking) (dramatic music continues) (door clattering) (metal clanging) (metal bar whooshing) Kate? (footsteps plodding) (engine humming) (footsteps plodding) Kate. (engine humming) (door clattering) (gun clanking) (footsteps plodding) Kate. (gun clanking) (feet thudding) (door slamming) (feet thudding) (footsteps plodding) Kate. Oh, my God. (footsteps plodding) Are you okay? (metal bar thudding) - Fine. You have some interesting friends. Murph is a real asshole. (metal clanging) - Yeah, I know. We gotta get outta here. (footsteps plodding) (door creaking) (gun clanking) We've been followed. (ties snapping) - It's him, isn't it? (metal clanging) - Yeah. (ties snapping) Later. (metal clanging) - Shit. - Come on. (footsteps plodding) (floor creaking) (Kate gasps) (metal bar clanging) Run. (body thudding) (Jackson grunting) (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) (fist thudding) (Jackson grunting) (soldier grunting) (body thudding) (fist thudding) (both grunting) (footsteps plodding) (gun clanking) (dramatic music continues) (both grunting) (gun thudding) (both grunting) (gun clanking) (knee thudding) (Kate grunting) (gun thudding) (dramatic music continues) (soldier grunting) (body thudding) (fists thudding) - It's just me and you now, frog man, and I eat seals for breakfast. (dramatic music continues) (soldier yelling) (fist thudding) (soldier grunting) (body thudding) (footsteps plodding) (both grunting) (knees thudding) (Dina grunting) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (chair clattering) (both grunting) (dramatic music continues) (gun clanking) (both grunting) (gunshot blasting) Looks like that's the end of your little girlfriend. You're next. (Jackson grunting) (knee thudding) (soldier grunting) (both grunting) (body thudding) (fist thudding) (Jackson grunting) (feet thudding) (soldier grunting) (body thudding) (fists thudding) (both grunting) (gunshots blasting) (Kate breathing heavily) (gun clanking) (Jackson breathing heavily) (hand thudding) (Jackson grunting) (feet thudding) (feet shuffling) - Are you okay? - Yeah, never better. (Kate laughs) Are you? - Same. Are all your hunting trips this much fun? - Yeah, all of 'em. (Jackson sighs) Sometimes you get to play the hunter, not the hunted. (Jackson sighs) What do you say we get some clothes on, go get that money? (Kate laughs) - And my father's ashes. (Kate exhales) (dramatic music) (coyote howling) (footsteps plodding) (Jackson breathing heavily) (foot thudding) (bag clattering) (dramatic music continues) (bag clattering) (Jackson grunting) (thunder rumbling) Should we open it? - Yeah. (dramatic music continues) (latches clicking) That is a ton of cash. (Kate laughs) - Just one more thing. - Well, I guess you'll never forget your first hunt, huh? - It's not over yet. (birds chirping) - Ain't it funny, though? You did all those martial arts, you know, for your dad, learned how to shoot a gun, but you never went hunting with him. (box clattering) (dramatic music continues) (Jackson sighs) (box thudding) (gunshot blasting) (Jackson grunting) (Jackson groaning) Why? Why? Why? (Jackson coughs) (Kate sighs) (walkie-talkie beeping) (Jackson gasping) (Jackson groaning and coughing) (Kate speaking in foreign language) (walkie-talkie beeping) - Why? (Jackson gasps) - I recruited you to kill my enemies. - What? (Jackson gasping) - You're a pawn. (Jackson gasping) - I saved you. (Jackson groans) - You did exactly what we knew you would do. (Jackson groaning and gasping) - I trusted you. (Kate speaking in foreign language) (gunshots blasting) (Jackson groans) (briefcase clattering) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (legs scraping) (Dina grunting) (Dina gasping) (hand thudding) (walkie-talkie beeping) - [Dispatcher] Dina, is it done? - She escaped. I'm gonna kill that bitch. (Dina gasping) (dramatic music continues)
