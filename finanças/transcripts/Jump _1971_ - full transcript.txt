[lion roaring] -Hey, girl. What time do you go off at, huh? I ever put money on you? You want some of that? You like it? Oh they treat you pretty good anyway don't they? Out here between races eating clover. You've got it made old girl. Yes you do! Yes you do. Come on! [slapping and horse neighing] [country music] You're bred for running, you lucky bastard. [engine starts] [narrator] -I come out of the corps, expecting to find Mercy in high school. It's why I sent my checks back here for. -What the hell can a girl do with a high school education,can you tell me that? [Chester] She can hardly do something besides read the Bible to mom all day long to get out of doing chores. -Chester, you know how hard I work to make a Sunday dinner when I get home from church. [Chester] I got to leave for Tampa before dinner I got something I want to work on on the Chevy. -We should be a family onSundays, Chester. I like to see us allaround the table as one family before God. I think if you want to work on an engine you should put in the time on that truck. It won't come out of little gear, it takes me near an hour to do the ten miles to town. -That's right Chester,I thought Mercy and me was never gonna getto church this morning. It'd be real nice if you'd fixthat up right and make a nice placefor it in the barn so she wouldn't sit outin the weather. [Chester] Weathering ain't gonna hurt it none. I'll fix it when I get a chance. I got reasons for doing thingsto the Chevy today. You should think more of your family, Chester. -You could clear all that junkout of the barn. Save the bus fare and drivethat Chevy into town. [Chester] It ain't meant for that kind of driving, daddy, and you know it! -Even if I did take it in there, everything worth anything on it'd be stolen. -Chester, you're only thinking about yourself. Remember the golden rule of our savior? The Lord Jesus Christ. -Mercy. There's a few things you don't know about. Now, I give Mom and Daddy all the extra money I can all the time. But I made a deal with Daddy here, pay 50 dollars rent every month on that barn so I can keep the Chevy out there and work on it. If there's tobacco to hang, I'd move it out, this minute. Right now, that Chevy stands to be our money crop. -Can you stand there and tell me that car will ever earn a Roosevelt dime? [Chester] Just an idea Dad. [country music] -My order. [car horn honking] -Yeah? Well I don't think that's funny. -Are you going to give mea bite of that thing, or what? -What are you talking about now? You work here, don't they give you free ones? -Uh uh, but I like yours. -Oh yeah? Aren't they all made the same? -Oh, honey,wouldn't life be dull if they were allmade the same? [car horn honking] -Hell. I don't think they're going to stop blowing their horn back there, unless you give them a little service. -Little is aboutall they can handle. -Hey, go on and see what they want. -Trying to get rid of me? -Oh no I'm not trying to get rid of you. -Oh well I'm not leavinguntil you tell me you're going to waitright here. -Hell, I gotta finish my sandwich, don't I? -You're going to save mesome of that stuff? -It's a foot long, there's enough for the both of us. -Ain't never enough, baby. [car horn honking] I'll be right back. Oh thanks! -Sure thing. You stop fooling now! -I take it you ladies and gentlemen want to put in an order? -If you've got the time. -Oh I'm long on time, little short on patience. What do you all want? -Two triple crown burgersand root beers for the ladies. A couple of pit barbecuesan order of fried onion rings, and chocolate shakesfor my buddy and me. And don't forget the napkins, salt and ketchup. -I'm always surprised by what some people can find to do with their hair. -I can't believe your fantasticrear end action. Mind if I touch? To see if it's real. -I'd love to oblige you, sugar. Oh, but seeing the kind of girl you're partial to, I'm afraid you'll find a little more than you could handle. Separate checks? -If you wantto take the time to make out separate checksthat's okay. Just make sure I get them all. [chuckles] Like the tapes? You see something you like? -Them's real deals or cheaters? -Nothing cheats on this car. -Spoilers work? -Does the job. -Hey, can you, uh... change the angle on it? -Nah. -What kind of engine you got? Factory or modified? -Look, uh... this car will do anything I want it to. Any more questions for the interview? -Only trouble with a thing like that, I'll tell you... It's too shiny and nice to take any chances with, you know? -I got this car because I like to drag. -Yeah. That sort of thing is all right I guess, but I meant something more, you know... You might scrape a little paint. Bend a little metal. -Like what? -Figure eight race by the airport? -Hard to say. [Chester] I'll tell you what. Let's just go on out there, and... Hell, I'll try to give you a little competition. Why don't we make a bet, say, one payment on your Mach One, here, 170? -Okay. You got that kind of money? -He's a big butterand egg man. -Don't let it worry you. See I got four fives, eight tens, five 20s there. -You hang on to that money. You got yourself a bet. -Done and done. [engines roaring] [inaudible screaming] -Okay. We both square off on your spare tire here, go in opposite directions. One of the girls can see if we line up proper, and give the go. There you see, those crossover roads here we're on here, got two of them down there. Cuts off these two islands of grass. The crossover roadsmake your figure eight, you see? Now the first guy to wind upback here where we started wins. If it's close, one of the girls here can see who's the first by the tire. Suit you? -Who crosses first if we both reach the figure eight at the same time? -The guy that wants to get across the most. How about it, you set? -Let's do it! [engine sputtering] [engine roaring] [engine whirring] -Ready... Go! [tires screeching] [country music] -It's your skimp chaser, wanting a $170 payment. -Take a check? -If I have to. -You boys look like deathand over. -Who do I make this out to? -Chet Jump will do. That's spelled J, U, M, P. -That's W, I, L, D. -I'm gonna need a little collateral, but I'm gonna try your bucket seat on for size. -You should do that for a living. -Haven't I seen your picture on a post office wall? -No, ma'am. -What are you doing? -Checking her out, buddy. -My carburater? I'll dry out all kinds of crap! -It won'tif you don't drive it too much and keep it under 30. -Now I know how the women felt during a stage coach hold up. -Are we going to be stranded out here? -Cool it, everything's under control. -Oh, yeah. -You leave meyour name and address, and I'll get this stuffback to you if that check don't bounce. -Hey! What if I have a flat? -Ah, hell, lay off smoking themthey'll ring you 20 000 miles! [a woman] We appreciate your concern. -I'll get this equipmentback to you, buddy, as soon as this check clears. [country music] [engine roaring] Damn it, daddy! Go and plug that in again, I'm gonna bust something up here! -How many times I gotta say to get it across to you? I can't afford to light up no barn. -Now, I paid the power bill more than once, I'm fixing to pay it again this month. So now go on and plug it in again! It ain't going to cost you a cent! -Sure as hell is costing me. If you've got money to throw around, you'd best help your family out. [dog barking] You ain't been eating gum and commodity food, lately, now have you? You going hunting up there? -No. I'm just... loading up some equipment. -Picked one hell of an hour to do it. Why'd you try sneaking in? I heard that gas-eating engine a mile off. -Well... Didn't want to wake you up. -Bull. You've been racing that Chevy, ain't you? [Chester] Maybe. -Maybe? The hell kind of answer is that? You've been racing it, ain't you? -Maybe it ain't none of your affair. -Getting to be real big city-wise, eh, kid? I got a notion you ain't saying because you got your ass beat real good. Ain't that right? -No need to worry. -I ain't. I ain't. What I wanna know is when you're going to get all that junk out of my barn. -What, you fixing to hang some bright leaf tobaccoout soon? -Maybe. -Now who's talking maybes? -My last crop was worth more than $2000. And the weather wasn't worth a good god damn. I had me some prime bright leaf. Every other place around here was burnt turd brown. -That's before I joinedthe corps and went overseas, more than five years ago. You ain't planted nothingbut your big ass since. -Quiet down, you'll wake up your mother and your sister. -They got to sleep with you banging around, we're talking way out of hearing, goodness starving. Bet you've been hitting that bottle again, huh? -Oh, I... I was a little dry,I had a... a couple of pulls.-You can't put that bottle down,can you, daddy? [Lester] Of, that's the stuff of life, boy. -What have you been drinking on? -I've got a fifthof good hickory. You want some? -Sure, sure. [radio chatter] Get that down. -Oh, yeah. Old pa had something to sayon everything, didn't he? Mercy and your mama keep repeating it to me. You think Mercy's ever gonna do something else besides sit on this porch and talk everlastingly about her Jesus? -The day mama stops going to church on Sunday. [radio host - radio] These bitches are going fast. Now here's a great old song that'll take you back a long way. I Can't Stand No More. [country music] ♪ I don't need any reason ♪ ♪ To try to quench my thirst ♪ ♪ They say I'm always in season ♪ ♪ But you were ten times worse ♪ ♪ I just tie all the loose ends the new ♪ ♪ And try talking to you ♪ [laughing] -You bettingon yourself? -Betting, yeah, some. -You win? [sigh] -Easy. -How much? [Chester] Not enough. -Not enough for what? -Quick change rear end. -You ain't ever gonna getthat big engine to fit that Chevy right. -Maybe not. -Why keep puttinggood money in it? -Because if it works, there's going to be nothing faster. I'd just get out in front... work on lapping the pack. -Seems like a waste. -That's because you ain't betting on yourself. -I quit betting on myself a long time ago. [baby crying] [country music] [a kid] Hey, Al. -Hey. -Got a cigarette? -All I got is menthol. -That smokesjust as long. Got a light? -You want me to smoke it for you too? -No, I can smoke good. -Oh yeah? Let's see what you got. -Where'd you learn to smoke like that? -In my friend's garage. [Chester] Oh yeah?-Yes sir. -Take care of yourself, huh? -Give me another one sometime? -I might. -I'll lookto see you coming. Bye. [knocking] [Beulah] Open it yourself! -Got my hands full of dinner! -I can't open, I'm washing my hair! -Come on, Beulah, open the door, I'm gonna go eat this by myself! -You can go live by yourself for all I care! -Be a whole lot betterthan I've been doing. -You could've fooled me. -Now where can Iset this stuff up? Look at that table. -Put it in the stove and set it to 250. I won't be eating for a good half hour yet. -Yeah, well I'm eating mineright now. -Yeah, see if I care. Put mine in the stove, like I told you. -Hell, it's too damn hotin here right now. -It can't get no hotter. Take some clothes off. I'll wash your hair for you when I get to eating. -No, come on now,I can't stick around. -What do you mean, you can't stick around? -I'm telling you,I can't stick around, I've got to hurry up and eat and catch a busfor Dayton City. I've got a whole lot of workto do on my Chevy. -It's Monday, stupid, you'll get laid off! -Well I don't givea big shoot. -Well I do. -Well I don't. I tell you,I'm leaving here forever. I mean I'm moving on,you understand? And I gotta get my car readyreal quick. -Quit sounding like a hillbilly record and get some sense. -Well I'm a briar, and you are too. -Well, I'm trying to get over it. -It ain't nothingto be ashamed of. -Well, that's just about as far as you can get, ain't it? -I'll tell you. I got far enough to knowthat I ain't taking orders from some two-bit half-assat that packing plant just to keep alive. Hell, I'm getting out while the getting's good. -So, so many things have been pretty good around here. [Chester] No, no... You don't understand me. I've got something going. Hell, I'm made to drive for a living. I'm going to do something about it, too. I'm entering the Pasco County stocks on Wednesday. What do you think of that, huh? Come on, what do you think of that? -I think I need a beer. -Come on, here you go. [country music] -What about us? [sigh] -Now who's talkinglike a hillbilly record, huh? -I mean, are you going to just walk out on me? -Sure. -That stinks a hell of a lot. get yourself out of here! -Won't take memore than a minute. -Well it ain't quick enoughto suit me. At least I'm on the rent! Think you're ready for them Pasco County boys' speed? [Chester] I'll try them out. -How much you get if you win one of them things? [Chester] Depends. -Cut that tight-lipped crap! You know damn well I mean if you win whatever the hell it is you're in, what'll it pay? [Chester] A hundred. -A hundred? Well, I can sure see why you gotta drop everything. What you want to say next, Chester, is, "Beulah. it's a first step toward much bigger things." -I don't see why I want to say anything next. -That's becauseyou ain't got a next. You ain't got enoughgoing for you. Boy, you're real closeto nothing. I was easy to get. But for a guy like you, I'm going to beawful tough to replace. You better not walk out on me like that! -The hell do you meanyou're quitting your job? What about your mamaand your sister and me? What are you going to do? -You can plant some tobacco. Mercy can get a job in Dayton City. Maybe even Tampa. About time she quit sitting on that porch and got out of here and living on her own. -It's just plain stupidto quit a good job like you got. -I don't mean to get stuck on that kind of work. Besides, they ain't hired a permanent loader in over a year. -Well, you've gotto send along something. You ain't going to be youngforever, you know. [Chester] I ain't worrying. -It's time you did. You got your own depending on you. -Yeah, I'll make out all right. -I used to think that too when I was a kid. And the depression came along and proved me wrong. You can't depend for certain on nothing. I was working the mines in Neon, Kentucky, in them days. I went down this shaft, picking and shovelling on my knees. Three-foot high cut. ten, 12 hours. Took six bits and said, "much obliged." -It don't need to be that way. -That's all you know about it, boy. It's either that or nothing to eat, no place to stand. We're going to be in the same fix soon one of these days if you don't take care. Times ain't so fat you can get a job just for asking! -I can always get the kind of work I had. There's a big shortage of guys willing to put another crack in their paycheck. And I aim to make mine racing. You can earn more in one afternoon than you can get fora whole month of moving freight. -Ernestine! Quit fooling with that money-sucking ice box and come and talk some sense into your child's head. He's almost thick as your daddy was. -That's no way to talkabout the departed. -Marted, departed, he's a dumb old bigot and this kid can match him bone, hams for hams. I can't understand why you didn't inherit some of the quality from my side. He's dumb enough to make a believing preacher. -You will suffer in hell for such blaspheming when the day arrives. [Chester] You're crazy, daddy. -I suffered the burden of keeping us out of the poor house! Ever since that damn Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought electricity to Kentucky. I had to sweat to pay the power bills for that ice box and that stove. You want to keep them gadgets going, you best be talking to your child here. [Ernestine] You're just looking for an excuse to get rid of him. Lord knows that stove and that ice box is older than Methuselah. Why, only my prayersis keeping them working. Chester knows that! He knows things is hardfor his people. He ain't let us down yet and I don't reckonhe's going to, are you, Chester? -No, ma'am. -You're going to do rightby your kin, aren't you? -Yes ma'am. -Why, I bet he's goingto give us something ahead right now on next monthso he knows his racing won't do no harmto his family. How much you reckonthat ought to be, Chester? -50. -Well, why don't youmake it 80, and start out witha real good feeling? -I can't give you no more than 60. I've got to hand the rest to John's racing association and get that Chevy in shape. -That's all you can spare for me, and your sister, and your daddy? You know, times ain't easy. 60 dollarsdon't go very far. -Now that's all I got! There ain't no more, see? See? That's all I can give you. -Well, it seems a shame. -Here. -bet you gave more to your whore in town. -I ain't got one. Wished I did. Two can live on a whole lot less than one when they're both working and split things even. -Don't tell me that kind of thing is right. -Well, now, maybe it ain't right, but it's cheap. Better than getting married! Can't count on a woman working when she's married, you wind up sweating your butt off so she can play with her hair, and listen to music all day long. -I will increaseyour labour and your groaning. And in labour,you shall bear children. Now that's the wife's place. You've gotta share with her. You can't buy your wayinto heaven, son. [sigh] -Guess I can't afford to go there. -May God forgive you. [muffled arguing] -Do you read your holy bibleevery day, Chester? -Afraid I don't. -You should, you know? I read it to mamaall day long. We live by the grace of God and should readHis holy word as it was given to usfor our salvation. -You ever think about getting out of here? Living on your own? [Lester] To hell with Chester's car, to hell with everybody's car! -This here porch ain't the whole world, you know? -The Lord is the most importantthing there is, Chester. And I have His holy wordbeside me at all times. A person can't askfor no more than that. Expect Him to answer. -Why don't you help mama with her chores more? -I read to her from the biblewhen she wants it. She says it makesher burden light. You might find out why,Chester, if you heard itread aloud. -Mercy. If you go back to high school, I'll pay for it. You could learn to be a secretary or something. You could get out of here, see things! Listen, see this? It's a shortcut, girl. It's a shortcut to a dead end. There's nothing in there. You've got to get out of here while the getting's good. -Chester, the bible is the mostimportant thing there is. -Listen to me. -Chester, the bible is the most important thingthere is. -Listen to me, Mercy. -You've gotta followthe acts of God.-There are other people... besides me, and mama, and daddy. There's kids your own age! You've got to get out...-All that mattersis the holy bible. To read it... -Listen to me, there's nothing in the bible! Don't you understand? -Chester, you're goingto go to hell. -No, no. You've got to get off of this, girl. You've gotta get off of this porch, off of this house...-Chester, the bible isall there is in life. -Don't you understand me? -All of it is important. Just open the bibleanywheres. And... and you'll find somethingbeautiful to thrill your soul. Listen to me readfrom whatever page it opens toand you'll see. Listen to me now. "But if you were notharking unto me, and will not dothese commandments... I'll apall over you... death, consumption, and a burning agony that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of the heart. Then you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemy shall eat it. And I will set my face against you, and you will be slain before your enemies. They that hate you shall reign over you, and you shall run when none pursueth you. And if you were not harking unto me, then I shall punish you seven times more for your sins." -Smart-ass! -Never slap me again, girl,or I'll kick your butt good! -You're lucky I don't blow your god damn eyes out, after the way you and your friends ran off Saturday night! Without paying! -Wait a minute,wait a minute! I paid you, it ain't my faultthat they didn't pay! -Yeah, you should have made them wait! -I can't tell themwhat to do! Hell, girl, they wereready to race, and I had to get themwhile they was ripe! -Bull... [car horn honking] -Wait a minute,that ain't no bull...[car horn honking] I got their moneyright here in my pocket. Now look at this girl, look! I'm going to pay for them god damn checks anyway, even ifit ain't my fault. And I'll put in a good size tipfor those girls, too. That's more than you're gaining,ain't it, ain't it? Now ain't it, huh? -Why are you being so nice to me, all of a sudden? -I'm thinking about taking youto the duck inn, tonight. -Oh, you got a nerve! -Ain't I, now? -I can't go until after last feature, anyway. -Oh, hell. What time is thatgoing to be? -About 40 minutes. Boy, that is some dynamite watch. -You like it, huh? -That is sharp, baby. -I'll tell you what. You can bring me a messof fried chicken to chew onwhile I'm waiting. -How a bout a... leg... side... and breast? -Of what? -A breast. -Sounds like a good placeto start. -Ain't gonna run off on me, are you now? -I ain't going nowhere. [bluegrass music] -How you like the music, Joe? -Oh, man, that's too much, really. [chatter] -It makes you want to move! -Makes you want to stomp that foot, don't it? -Yeah, well, it's authentic, anyway. -Hey, you take a little off the top of them beers and I'll pick it up. -Thanks. -I don't know, but it looks kind of strange. Give that a try. I think you'll like that. -Oh, goodness gracious. Oh, my mother told methere'd be days like this. -Here's to you. [chatter] There you go. That's fine stuff! -Cheers, pals! -On three! -It's all fine! -Yours! [all coughing] -You like it, do you Charlie? -Oh, that's beautiful,that's beautiful! Let me havesome more of that. -If you like that, boy, I've got something for you. Give me that pot of moon out of your purse. -I'm running low. [Chester] Come on. -If I were you,I'd watch out. -You're gonna like this, boy! [cheering] -Thanks very much. I spy a couple of my buddies over at the bar. Right now, we're going to take a short pause for a good cause, be back in a few minutes for some good old picking and grinning. Thank you. [applause] -You win races by running the hottest car you can get wide open. -Oh, bull. There's no talent involved! The Le Mons course requires 64 gear changes per circuit. 64, every time around! That takes skill and cool. -Yeah, well so does just keeping your foot flat on the gas. -Any ass can do that. -You ever done any racing? -I've been tryingto get it through to you That there's noreal racing in this country. I discipline myselfwith point to point rally. -Yeah, I heard of that. That sounds like a bunch of Sunday driving to me. -You just don't understand it, then, friend. -Yeah, I understand a little money says a lot more than a lot of hot talk. -What do you mean? -I mean I bet you or any other fern car driver 100 greenback american dollars I'll beat you from here to Tampa right now in my old 64 Chevy. -64 Chevy, hell man, are any of those old tin cans still running? -Here's one left you can't beat. -You're putting me on, you're putting me on. -Lay a hundred down and find out. -You're talking from below your belt, friend, you're just trying to impress your girl. That'd be pretty easy... -Match it. -You want some of that money? [a man] Why not? -How about you, Brandon? [Brandon] Include me. -Okay, boys. My friend, you are matched. -That's a pretty little picture, but... what the hell am I supposed to do with that? -You hold onto it, and if you win, we'll go to a bank and get some cash with it. -There going to be three of you racing? -Yeah, probably. -This thing worth 300? -Well yeah, it's worth 300 and more. You don't need to worry about that. Since you ask... I only see about $100 of your money here. -Now you see it. -Now you do see it. All right, boys. We got ourselves a race. Fellas, he's gotmy credit card for cover money, You and Brandon will have to owe me the hundred, all right? -Okay, well, when do we start? -Yeah, well I'd say right about now. We'll probably catch us some daylight to run without our headlights. -Okay, let's use the old Le Mons start, shall we? We'll grab our girls and run for the cars. -Well, what's the signal? -I'll tell you, I've got about enough of that right in here for about a drink apiece. Suppose we split it up. Each guy leaves as soon as he finishes his off. -All right, sounds good. -Hell man, you're way behind us. You've got to kill it. -Nobody's told me the rules or where we're going. -Well, I'll tell you. I think we should take the 33... You know where that is? Crosses through Coocher's swamp. We're gonna pick up I4 at Polk City. You know, we miss all them string towns, close to ten. Now, the first guy that hits where I4 crosses over I75 in Tampa... wins. We're going to meet for the payout on the top deckof the municipal parking garage. Okay? Okay, all right. -Ready guys? Drink! -Come on, girl! Come on, we got them now! -Come on baby,get it together! [country music] -Just hop in! [engines roaring] -We're still ahead! Faster, Jump, faster! We're way ahead of them, baby! -That's as close as they're going to get! -You know you were doing 95 in a 65 mile zone? -I knowI was speeding, officer, but my fiancéeis feeling terrible... [country music] -Get them, Jump! [country music] Oh shoot, boy! That is the wayto win your money! -Sure is. I'm gonna check this engine some. -We sure beat the hellout of them boys. -Yeah, hell. trouble is, it ain't no contest. -Oh come on,that was fantastic, baby. Fantastic! Well, well, well,Jump, come here. We got ourselvessome company. Slick-looking cars,ain't they? -Yeah, looks don't help them run no faster. -I wouldn't mindhaving me one of them. -Oh yeah? Can't take them racing. You need something like your Chevy to help you pull off some of the chances you've gotta take. -Well, you sure put onthe brakes too much, do you? -Hell no, baby, the brakes just slow you down! -Yeah, well, took the curlout of my hair too. -Fun, ain't it? -Damn, that wasfantastic, baby. -Hiya, troops! -Hey man, not so loud,I've got a heavy head. -Where have you been? -I became ill. Seems that whatthe neck drop friend over there was very potent. Then followed a very expensive encounter with the county gendarmes. I'll arrange things with the owner of the famous Chevrolet. Know of any banks around here? -Yeah, I know a couple. Right near here. That card good anywheres? -Yeah, with a few phone calls. -Well, you give me a minute, and we'll go try her out, huh? -All right. Say, do you ski, Chet? I mean, stock-car racing is fine, I suppose, but it seems limited in the long run. -You have got to try these pancakes. They're the best I've ever ate. I wantsome more syrup, please. Thanks. -The only limit is the guy behind the wheel. You come out to Pasco County on Saturday if you want to see some action. I'll see you get in for nothing. That'll handle the check. Come on, baby. -I sure liked them grits. They were just rightwith them steak and eggs. I had a couple put some eggson top of their steak before, but I never tried it. I mean,not for breakfast, anyhow. I wonder if peopleeat like that all the time. Shit. I'd get fat and uglylike a big old double-chin sowin no time. Sure was fine food. God, did you trythem pancakes? How was your toast, anyway? You can pull up to my side of the sea breeze any time. -I just might do that. -You know, I called Maude Forbes, she said she'd take half my shift. Now if you want, baby, I can call her back, she can take it all. And then you and I go somewhere. -I tell you,I'd like to do that, but... I've got a lot to do and not too much timeto do it in. I've gotta getthat Chevy in shape too, and... we gotta hustle to get youthat trailways, huh? -Yeah, okay. -Come on. You know I'm goingto be coming to see you first chance I get. [engines roaring] [metal crumpling] [metal clanging] [a man - loudspeaker] Now it's 19 followed by 42 and 33. -Oh, man, I can't stand it. Hey, fella! -You talking to me? [Babe] Yeah, you, can I... Can I see you for a minute? -What about? -You want a deal on a quick change rear end? -Hold on a minute. -Give me a smoke, will you? You gave one of my boys a hard time out there. I'm Babe Duggers. This is April Mae. -Hey. -Chet Jump. -Chet who? -Jump, Chet Jump. -Well, you looked pretty good out there. -Sorry? -I said you looked pretty good out there. I'd like to see you again sometime, in a race of a longer duration. Sometime when your car don't give out. -Yeah, you got a real hard charge, honey. Shame you ain't got a car to make it pay off. -You work around here? -Don't work at all. Quit to drive. -Say, you're taking a big chance, aren't you? Most of the guys around here, they drive just for a hobby. -Yeah, I know. That's why they don't get no further. -Is that a fact? Well, I've always got a deal for somebody who knows where he wants to go. Now here's how it works. See, I sponsor a car from each one of my eight garages, for public relations purposes. Now, my driver, they work full time for me, as mechanics, and I allow them to use my abundant facilities to put their cars in shape. Now, you've gotta do that on your own time. The only pay you get for driving is... what you win. You interested in an arrangement like that? -Maybe. -Look, I ain't gotta know right now, we can work out a day. -Don't play hard to get, sugar. God knows that Babe can make things happen real fast for people. -How true. -I'm listening. -All right, here's how I'm going to set you up. I'm going to give you a job, and $1000 credit, and a small monthly interest... to buy that quick change, anything else you might need, and I'm also going to help you locate good used equipment too. -Yeah, Babe knowsevery junkyard in town. -If I decide to put you on my team... you don't pay for anything, now how about that? -What's the job? [Babe] Mechanics helper. And you're going to work with this here German who knows everything there is to know about automobiles. -What he don't know about carsyou can just write right in the head of a pin. -I have had top drivers in this business offer to work for me, next to nothing, just for a chance to see my German in action. Now, do you want it or no? I pay trainees $2 an hour. -I'll bet on myself. -Beautiful. Now, I'm going to have a tow truck here in 20 minutes. So mechanics work from eight to five. You report 7:45, Monday morning. -Gosh, it's just beautiful,you're gonna love it. -Will you hush up. -Well... -Now, my helpers, they come in a little bit early to set up and they stay late to clean the service area. -I get paid for that extra work? -Now, an apprentice like yourself has got to do something for the privilege of learning a vocation. And another thing is, as long as you work for me, you're gonna do your job and do it well or might as well forget about it. Now, you understand them conditions? -Yeah. -Well, get a little bitmore excited about it than that. This is your big chance. -Well, maybe you can hard charge, Jump, but you ain't worth a diddly-damn when it comes to conversation. -You've got to get alongto get ahead! -Yeah, maybe so. I'll remember to work on that. -Good. Let's go, huh? -Bye, we'll be seeing you. -Now, you understand, if you turn this knob here, this gives you a chance you can isolate any cylinder you want to see how she's firing. -Yeah, it's tuned all right, but I don't see where you couldn't have done just as well by ear. -Oh, no, this gives you a chance to see the problem in a different way. Go with this. -Well yeah, but so what? I could've tuned it without that gadget. -Yeah. Maybe. -Hey. It looks like every time I come in here in the morning you're always workingon this car. Don't you ever getany rest? -Oh, yeah. -Did you finish putting inthe quick change? -Yeah, she's just about ready. You want to take a look? -Yeah, sure. [pop music on radio] Yeah, yeah. You know, that's... a very nice job. -I figure I can change ratio for any track I'll run on now. Cut and salt 550 horses. -Yeah, that'll give youmuch more control. -Way to go, Chet, way to go! [roaring engines] [cheering] [April] Hey! Where is he going to, dutchman? -He went directlyto the payment booth. -Ah, see there Babe, he's got a realpractical side, too. -That's against the rules, taking a stock into that area. [knocking] [April] Hey. -Hey. -How are you? -Okay, how about you? -Oh, I'm fine,thank you. -Good, good. Babe said you wanted to see me. -Yeah. Yeah, I did. Babe thought you oughtto see this. That's stunning, ain't it? -This and 35 cents would get me a beer in any bar in town. [laughing] -Well now, you're getting the hang of it. And because you're so smart, you get to drive me around town on Sunday. How about that? -What for? -Tell me something. If you think you ain't sitting right here watching that car of yours is just going to get up and prance right out the door, prance right on outby itself out on the street? -No, hell no.-Yes you do. -I don't. -Uh-huh, you do. -Well, yeah. Is it going to take all day? -Yeah, yeah, it'll takemost of the day, yeah. -Yeah, well, I reckon I can spare the time. -Well, thank you. The thing now is this, see, Babe has gotten himself an idea for a new TV commercial. And he wants me to go and have a look at it. Well, he's going to be tied up in one of those infernal sales meetings. And there's this huge station wagon they need for the routine, and I just can't stand to drive those big mothers. That's where you fit in. I thought we'd get us some fried chicken and some beer. You drink beer, don't you? -Yeah, sure. -Yeah, and some beer, we'd just have us a little picnic. How's that suit you? -Sounds okay to me. -All right, all right. Okay, it's a deal. -Okay. What I've got to say. Affects you all. I had to fire Stanley Otim, just ten minutes ago. I didn't want to do it. But Stanley wouldn't accept his responsibilities. A customer came in with a complaint about a 1967 Fairlane. Thank you so much for joining us, dutchman. He said the automatic transmission was gone because the seals were shot. He says the brakes were fading because the seals were gone! And the shocks, he said, was leaking all over! Now, he hadn't driven that... car 200 miles! [phone ringing] Free repairs, he asked me, I can't blame him. He demanded an explanation. Speed specialties, good evening. I see, well, listen, would you call back tomorrow morning? We'd be only too happy to help you then. Bye bye. My name is on that warranty. Mine! I am the one who has to stand behind it. So I invited Stanley Otim to come in here, and I asked him... How come? How come he let a car go out in that condition. Well, Stanley left me down. He said... there just wasn't enough time allowed to give a good inspection, and he couldn't be held responsible. Well, I fired Stanley. Somebody else is going to get fired if they don't pay a little attention here. [phone ringing] And I told that customer... that it wasn't true! And it isn't! I don't operate a flat-rate shop! [phone ringing] Hell no! I treat you fellows like professional men. Speed specialties, good evening, may I help you? Just a minute ma'am.. Yes ma'am, we have a full line of pleasure... You come in tomorrow morning, and we're going to take care of you. Well, what a pity, oh, bless your heart. You come and see us. Bye. As I said, I treat you fellas like professional men. We all agree on the time that it takes to do a job. And I pay you a good salary for you to fulfill that agreement. You don't get paid by how many cars you turn out here in a day, no sir! Because we all chip in! And we do the work that's here until it is done, and it is done right! That's teamwork! And that's what Babe Duggers' big team is all about. Now, I give you fellas a lot of special opportunities nobody else is going to offer you. You're on the big team! Our team is admired by everybody in stock car racing! And there are men who are waiting with their tongues hanging out... To get in on that team. That's why I won't put up with the Stanley Otims, because he's wasting an opportunity that somebody else really wants and deserves. All right, it's closing time, I'll see you all tomorrow. Now I know... I know, just a minute, mister Jump. Fellas! I know that most of you don't need to hear this. You're already with us all the way. But since this Stanley Otim things come up, I thought it best to repeat what we stand for. The best, god damn it, the very best! -I'm sorry, mister Wilhelm claims that... Will you tell dutch junior that a Harley carb is better for a man than a Japanese raptor set? -You Americans. Always trying to... bolt on some extra horsepower. -You better set him straight on the facts of life, dutch! -That dutchman,he's a real German, ain't he? -You bet your old strudel he is. Never let you forget. Always telling us how much better they do things at Mercedes Benz. His family is still over there in Stuttgart. -Why'd he quit then? -He thinks mass production engines are for shit, don't matter who makes them. -Well, hell. What's he doing here? -Listen. Don't you two guys talk about nothing but cars and equipment all day? -That's about it. -Jesus. He's a tough one to figure. Babe's got some kind of deal for everybody. I owe him my shirt. -You figure... he's got the dutchmanin debt? -And I'll leave it to you to figure that one out. Dutch junior. [engine roaring] -You've got this thingsounding mighty fancy. -Well hell, that's what I've been working on it for. -You sure have. I really hate to bother you, but that sounding off you'd been doing has been screwing up the audio out there something awful. -Audio? -Yeah, the audio... Oh, Babe's doing a commercial out there. Ain't you never seen him do one? -Nope. Oh come on, you've got to, it's funny. It's funny as hell,come on!-Well I tell you, I think I better do some more work here. I'm gonna do something that's real quiet, don't worry. -Now you havea little fun. Now listen, here, you tell me. How many times do you see a full-grown man make a complete ass out of himself in front of God and everybody? -Well, okay, I guess it's something I better not miss. -No sir, you better not. I'm telling you, it is the one time old baby just goes balls out. It is so cute. -Well, how oftendoes he do that? -Oh, well he's on TV every night in colour, you haven't seen it? -No, I never have. -Here it is in a beautiful saltand light lime-green finish. Miss is going to love that one. AM, FM radio. And folks, this car, it's A-okay inside and out and you know why! It's got the big Babe's signature, five star warranty. Now, sold brand new, this car goes for a staggering $6100! But from the big Babe here,only 4495 puts it in your home. Next car. -Oh, cut. -Come on, it's just a car, ain't it? Now stop the thing with the rocket! Am I coming across clear on the audio? -Very clear, Babe. -Hey, Leroy, how about the tie,that okay? -Fine, Babe. -Give me the caddy, I'm up for that one. -Oh, Babe's real cute. He says the...that tickles me.[car horn honking] -He appears to me to be doing all right. -Oh yeah. Don't I know it. Hey. So you're getting that Chevy all fixed up, huh? -She's moving along. -That's good. It's real good. You're going to do all right, you know, once you get it all in shape. Oh hey, now watch this. I want you to watchold Babe try to sell this old stuffed shirtpiece of merchandise. You just watch himgo to town now. -The ultimate driving experience. Well, here it is, the aristocrat among cars... intended for the aristocrat among men. Now, when you step inside a cadillac, you are stepping inside another world. Now, the big Babe can put you into that world. You come on down, you're gonna be amazed at this bargain. You're entitled to the best, and big Babe here, he wants to see that you can afford it too. -Lord, he oughtto wipe his mouth with toilet paperafter that. Hey. Don't take it so serious. You can go a long wayon...[car horn honking] if you can laugh at it. -Yeah. -Yeah, you can. -I don't see where I can afford to laugh at it. -Yeah, I know. I used to be like that. It's right easy to learn. That's how you get alongwith guys like Babe. Just loosen upa little bit. It ain't gonna hurt much. -No, maybe so. I tell you, I think I better get on back working on the Chevy. I'll find something to work on that won't make too much noise, huh? -Well, we'll miss you. I'm going to be watching youin that race on Saturday, I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to be out rootingreal hard for you. You just ought to win it all,this time. -I hope so. -I'll be betting on you. -I'll be looking to see you there. -Oh, I will. -Good. -Bye. -So long. -See you, yeah. [country music] -Why don't you... machine polish it, like the rest of the men? -It's betterto do it by hand. You can feel the burrs. -Well, I tell you, miracles could happen. You might become a craftsman yet. -I'll tell you, Dutchman. Take some troublewith a Chevy engine. It pays off. They're alwaysready to move out whenever you are. -Yeah. They've been perfecting the same basic engine for 15 years. Every year, they make it a little better. -Ford did something like thatwith their flathead. -You wouldn't kid me now, huh? -For 20 years, all the partswould fit any of them, no matterwhen it was made. You could take an old oneand get it real hot. Now did you know that,Dutchman? [laughing] -"Did you know that, Dutchman?" -Okay. Old junior's got you all figured out, Jump. -Money makes everybodyeasy to figure. -Yeah. But of couse, the size of that purse means that you'll be up against some pretty damn good boys. They're just itchingto find out if you're for real. As a big competitor. Of course, it is between you and them to decide whether you're on the big team with us. Yes, some of the top drivers in stocks... got their opportunity on my big team. -Yeah, I know. -Well, we're going to be watching you! Real close. Closer than you've ever been watched before. -Well, have yourself a real good time. -Yeah. Say hi to April Mae for me. -Welcome fellas to Golden Gate Speedway. We're here this afternoon for an afternoon of good, hard, safe, clean racing. When I say safe, I mean that the only way it can be made safe is by you fellas driving like you want to go home to eat breakfast tomorrow and not be in the hospital. We're not going to have any rough driving. That isn't going to go here. There's two or three of you guys that I call smart fellas. You've been running a lot of dirt. You don't learn this black top in one afternoon. Just remember that. Also, you're a little biton what we call the smart side. We're not going to have any bumping, any nerfing, knocking fellas around. You do that, you're only going to create a lot of unnecessary hazards and you're only going to get yourself disqualified. Now remember, when that red light turns on up there, I mean for everybody to stop. The only reason I'll use that red light is I think someone is in real bad danger, and they're fixing to get in trouble if they're not already in trouble. On these starts, you come down at 30, 35 miles an hour. You'll take and stay in line until such a time as I drop the green flag. If you jump... and there's a couple of you that are cuties, you do jump, if you jump... I'm going to put you in the back. You do it the second time, you're going in the pit. Now, I don't want to have to argue after the race why I did this or why I did that. You'll be the one to cause yourself to go out. Okay fellas, good luck, I wish you could all win. [country music] [engines roaring] [country music] -You can do it Chet! -Hey, take it easy! You ain't paying for that tin. One lap's nothing. I wonder why the hell he's in the lead by over a lap. -Oh, that boy is good. [country music] [engines roaring] -Look at that brow, he's too crazy to handle! He doesn't have a god damn radar! -Shit, Babe, it's his first timeat this kind of racing! -Yeah, well, it's the last time for me. [a man - loudspeaker] Cars are starting to line up again so we can start up the race, with the second place car, number 21, out of the running, the new line up will be number nine first. Number seven second. 24 third. 87 fourth. -Boy, I can't waste money to pull up a driver. This game's too expensive. Maybe after a few more seasons on the dirt track, you'll be ready for the good time. Look, you and me, we made a deal. Now, I held up my end of it, I expect you to hold up yours. You can pay back that $1000 credit at the rate of 2.5% interest a month. -Before, you said it was 1.5%. That makes it 30% interest a year. -Things have changed since then. It's become very expensive to keep my cars on the tracks. I can't give money away. -Well, I don't reckonyou got too much cause to worry. -Now, listen, I'm sick of being latched to you. That's a heck of a lot cheaper than a signature-only loan. Now you pay me back, or I'm going to take you to court! And that car of yours... That'll be just the beginning of what it'll take to cover the judgment. [April] Chet, Chet. You keep on hard charging, yeah? [Chester] Yeah. Thanks. -Let's hit the old place for dinner, huh? -And here's your receiptfor the battery. You show the gate guard. It's all you're allowedto salvage. -Can I sign this receipt to anybody I want? -Oh sure, just write his nameabove yours. Is this the first timeyou've driven one of the... -Yeah. -Well, the main thingis to try and protect your front endas much as possible. Most of the guy goin reverse as all they can so they can savethe front end. You've got to tryand make contact every 30 secondsor you're disqualified. Now you take this flagand fix it to the driver's sideof the car, where everybody can see it. Then when you thinkyou've had enough, just break the flag off,you're out of the contest. And that's all. Ain't real much to it. -Yeah, it's what I figured. -Well, good luck. -Thank you. -I don't understand why you are doing this. Something could be worked out. -Yeah. I know. [engines roaring] Give these to Babe. -What are these? [Chester] Receipts. -For what? -For shoving up his... [engine roaring] [metal crumpling] [metal scraping] [a man - loudspeaker] 13 flag. 29 flag. 23 flag. 21 lost a wheel but he's still going on. 86 flag, 93 flag. 20, 55, 89 flag.
