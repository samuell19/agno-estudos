Well, I can, I, well, yeah, of course, watch me. Right, right, I'll call you tomorrow. Yeah, goodbye. (phone clangs) (dramatic music) (man claps) Right, all right. All right!

You know if I were a judge counselor you would win every case. - Nick, I'm going to be in Sacramento for the next two days. Nobody in the firm ever thought I'd even get this far. - Did, I always did. - Unless I can concentrate, we won't both be winners because I'll lose. Okay, that file is here.

What a pleasure to be working with a real pro. - You know I don't mean to sound, I appreciate that. But I don't mean to sound unappreciative or even modest, but that was pretty routine stuff Morgan. Next time, no, no, no, next time I'd like to get down into the canyon. - I'm sorry, the helicopter was great. Stay up high Nick. - I think, I think if you could just see. - Forget it, just keep doing what you know. (door clicks) - I was at ring side when he knocked out the dragon lady. Hey, she loved it. - Yeah, that's what worries me. She doesn't want it better, she wants a Friday. I wish just once. - Listen, listen. I have some people coming over Sunday night.

I don't want a part in your film, really. I mean, I don't think I could even recite the pledge of allegiance in one take. No, I'm a film student at community college. - Really? - That's all theory, you know, I've never actually been on a real set. - Nothing but problems. - But you're making a film. - Yeah but.

Here you come sneaking in three hours late. - Well I wouldn't have to sneak in if you trusted me. - Marisa I want to talk to you, sit down. - Are you going to read me my rights first? - I told you to be home at 10 o'clock tonight, definite. No interpretations. Marisa don't you understand? I am the guy they pay to get the ambulance when some wacko beats up a kid and leaves her dead in the street. Don't you understand? - What do you want from me? I am in advanced studies, my room is clean, I do housework and every once in a while I come home late and you interrogate me like this. - You don't know what kind of world we really live in. I can't let what happened to your mother happen to you. - I am not my mother. I am my own person. I'm gonna go get a glass of milk. - Wait a minute. - What, I can't have a glass of milk? - Just wait a minute. I want you to listen to me. Some night you ought to come to work with me and I can show you what happens to little girls who think that they can take care of themselves. - I don't want to hear any of this, you don't understand anything. - I am trying to be mother and father to you and every time I say something, it's like I'm butting into some private little thing of yours. - You don't know what happens to other kids. - I don't care about other kids. If their parents don't care, what happens to them. - That's the point! You never let anything happen to me! - Oh , I'm interested in what happens to you. - No you don't! - I'm interested that you come home when you are supposed to come home. - You just want me to be a good daughter and do what you want me to do. - Do you realize that I called dispatch ten minutes ago to try and find out where the hell you were? - Listen to me! - I want you home when you're supposed. - I can't, I can't do this. - Okay, some people only understand things the hard way, so here it is in black and white.

They've been sitting on my transfer request for six months now. And I'll bet you I'm stilL working vice when they give me the gold watch. - Jen has been working you over, huh Frank? - She thinks I would be around more.

Oh just lucky I guess. Listen I know all the answers honey, and I'm gonna try to talk to you straight. - Gonna book me or what? - I'm trying to make a deal with you. - If you got 50 bucks we can make a deal. - You don't listen good do you? Okay, final offer. I cut you loose, there's no paper work and no record. You let me call your folks and I put you on a bus tonight, what do you say? - Stuff it. - She's all yours. (upbeat music) - [Sandy] Hello? - Sandy, this is uncle Mike. I just called home and there's no answer, now where is she? - Sorry, I should have called when we got back. She's here uncle Mike. - Let me talk to her. - She's taking a shower, hey it's okay. - Are you sure? - Sure I'm sure. I'll tell her you called, okay? - Yeah okay. (upbeat music) (shower running) (Nick humming) (dramatic music) - Hi. - I'm Mike Vogel. - Oh yeah. - I'm Marisa's father. Can you tell me if she's been to school today? (dramatic music) - Good morning. - Hi. - Where you going? - I'm gonna go catch the bus. - What, you're leaving? - Leaves in about ten minutes. - Well can I give you a lift or something? - No, I don't want to put you out. - Now wait a minute, wait, wait.

I'm married, I've been married for 18 years, but for the last couple of years, I don't know. I think it's over. That's beside the point. What happened last night has nothing to do with that relationship or anything else besides you and me. It was beautiful last night. I felt alive for the first time in a long time. - Hi. - Hi. Did you have a good time? - Yeah, it was great. - Sandy tell you that I called? - Yeah, she told me I'm on the way to school this morning. - You know Marissa I'm very proud of you. There isn't a man in my precinct who doesn't think you're fantastic. That's why it hurts me so much when you lie. You didn't go to school today. I checked. - No, no, I stayed at the film location. Cause I missed the last bus. - Where did you sleep? - At a motel with the, with the other film crew. - How did you afford a motel? That's 40, 45 dollars at least. - Well I stayed with a couple of women. There was a wardrobe lady, and a makeup lady, and they just gave me a sleeping bag. - No one else? - What do you mean? - I mean like guys. - Yeah, there were guys all right. There were guys in every corner of the room and they were just lined up waiting for me, okay? - Just a minute, don't you talk to me that way. - That's what you're thinking isn't it? (dramatic music) - Dispatch. This is 104, I need warrant check on DeLeon, Nick S. - [Radio] Roger, 104. - I need that now dispatch. - [Radio] Roger.

When I called Arthur to tell him, he said, he's going to propose me for a full partner. Well, congratulate me. - Congratulations. - Oh. - That's great, that's great. - Well, on a scale of ten your enthusiasm is a two. What are you doing? - I'm just getting some books together. Didn't we have a dictionary, a small pocket size, with a plastic cover? - What? Oh, Andrea took it to school. - That's it. - Why? - Well, I have decided to take the time off and just finis writing my film. I've I rented a place at the beach. - You've rented a place at the beach? - Yeah, it's quieter there and there's no distractions. - As opposed to this mad house? - It'll just go better if I'm alone. - Alone? Don't you want to talk? - Now you wanna talk. - This isn't because of what I said about your film, is it? - Believe me, it's not just that. I've been trying to talk to you for a long time, but you've been too busy. - Oh, that's right. Blame me as usual. - Come on, let's not have a war over this, all right? - Oh no, you just want to go off and do your thing without a word and to hell with your responsibilities. I know what it is. I know what it is. You don't want to talk because you were afraid the truth might come. Huh? You're afraid of, there's someone else, isn't there? Answer me! - I'm not sure. - What the hell kind of an answer is that? - It's the one you're getting (smacks) (dramatic music) - Hi, I'm looking for a student here. Her name is Marisa Vogel. I have a book for her. - Vogel? - Yeah, that's right. - I don't think we have a Vogel. Is it with a V? - Yes, Marisa Vogel. She's a film student here. - [Receptionist] Not in this department. - Are you looking for Marisa? - Yeah, Marisa Vogel. - She's across the hall, Edinboro. - Thank you, thanks very much.

Here, I brought you a book, a filmmaker's manual. - Really? - It's a good book. - Thank you. - You're not the easiest person to find you know. The receptionist out there never even heard of you. - Well, she's new, she doesn't know everybody. - Oh, well she checked that computer read out of hers, and you weren't on the list of film students. - Well you don't have to be a film student to take a film class. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Mr. Raphael, This is Nick DeLeon, he's a director. - It's a real pleasure, Mr. DeLeon. - The pleasure's mine. Really, I just do industrial films. - Just, you're being modest. You earn your living at it. I don't suppose I could twist your arm to show some of your work to my students? - Sure, yeah, I'd love to do that. - Really appreciate it. Kill the lights, roll the tape. You're welcome to stay and watch. - I can't. (upbeat music) I split with my wife last night. I want to talk to you about it. I got some shopping to do. You can tag along, and give some expert advice. When the going gets tough. The tough can go shopping. (upbeat music) (Marisa chuckles) (engine rumbles) - Excuse me Mrs. DeLeon. I'm detective Vogel. - Yes? - I'm interested in locating your husband. - Something wrong? - No, nothing like that. I just need a little information. It seems that he witnessed something in Lakewood Canyon. - Witnessed what? - I'm not at Liberty to say. - I'm an attorney. - Well, this is very important and I could get a subpoena. - I don't know where it is, but I do have a number. It's five, five, five. - One second, please. Five, five, five. - Eight, five, two, oh. - Eight, five, two, oh. Thank you very much. - Yes. - It's all I need (dramatic music) - It's a beautiful drive, isn't it? - Yeah. - Okay, let's see if we can get all of these packages in, in one load. - Okay, let's do that. - Ready? - Yeah. - Arms out. - Okay. - One. - You know I think we really work well together.

Well, you know, when my movie deal finally comes through, I get all the money. I'm gonna spend most of my time out here. - How exciting. - Yeah. - So maybe you need an assistant. - Well, maybe. - Maybe. (dramatic music) - You have any credentials? You can just put it down. (dramatic music) - This is such a beautiful house. I mean I rarely get a chance to come to the beach. - Well maybe this will give you an excuse to come more often. - I would like that a lot. (dramatic music) - Would you do me a favor? - Yeah. - Would you try. - Oh no. - No, no, this one on once again, please? - But I tried all of these on at the store. - I know, I know, but you know things don't look the same in the store. The lights. - Oh okay. - Kind of weird, nice choice. - Thank you. - Do you always buy your daughter so many presents? - Well, she needs lots of clothes for school. - She's very lucky. - Let's see. Turn around. You like it? - Oh, it's beautiful. It's beautiful, she's going to love it. - It's yours. - Thank you, thank you. (engine rumbles) - Aren't you gonna show me the rest of the house? (dramatic music) - This is the kitchen. (dramatic music) (gate creaks) - Sh. - What? (gate creaks) - There's somebody out there. (dramatic music) Get dressed. - What's the matter? - Just get dressed quick. (dramatic music) - Hi. - You Nick DeLeon? - Yeah, that's right. - Police. - What's the matter? - I wanna ask you a few questions. (dramatic music) Marisa! - Hey, where do you think you're going? Hey who the hell are you anyway? What the hell are you doing here? (Marisa screams) - What are you doing? Leave him alone! Stop it, you're gonna kill him! - Get in the car! - Stop it, daddy please no more! - What? - [Marisa] No more! - In this state it's statutory rape DeLeon. My daughter's 16 years old. Come on Marisa, we're going home! - [Marisa] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - 16 Years old? And you couldn't tell? - Put her in a lineup with a dozen 18, 19 year olds, you'd never pick her out. - She gave her consent? - Come on Arthur, yeah. - Okay. Well cop or not, outraged father or not, we could charge assault. - No, it's got nothing to do with this. What I need to know is what's the worst he can do with a statutory rape charge. - The DA is going to tell him to forget it. But if he doesn't, it could be a few years. Don't worry, I'll be there for you. I hope my law partner understands. - Has Sharon said anything? - No, not a word. - What is is? - [Woman] Detective Vogel is still waiting, sir. - How long has he been waiting now? - [Woman] 25 minutes. - Did you tell him I'm buried? - [Woman] I did. - All right, I'll see him. - Mike. Hey, it's been a while. You look terrific, what have you been working out or what? - Very little. - Listen, I'm sorry I had to keep you waiting, as you can see, I'm up to my ears. Have a seat. - Yeah right, you're busy. Well, I'll get right to the point. It's about my daughter. - Yeah, I spoke to Lou Gavin, he filled me in. Mike I'm really sorry about what happened to her. - Yeah, well that's what I got from him, but I don't think he understands. So that's why I'm here. - Mike I'm afraid I'm going to have to back Lou on this one. It's a tough nut. Real tough. - In other words I'm supposed to pretend that nothing ever happened. - Look I know it's a lousy thing to say, but if I were in your shoes, I would do exactly that. - No way. - Look Mike, do you have any idea what we'd be up against in there? There's no way I could keep her off the stand. No way. And DeLeon can afford one rough defense. His guy will go after her like a shark and do everything he can to prove that she misrepresented her age. I mean, everything. Do you really want to put your daughter through that? - I want to put him away. That's what I want to do. No force was used, no coercion. She went to the guy's house. It's a victimless crime, Mike. - Like hell. - Mike. He did not pick her up in the school yard with a bag of candy. I sympathize with you. I'm on your side, really. That's why I am advising you to forget. - I figured this, I'm ready for you. 150 names here. Every man in my precinct, that's 150. By the end of the week I'll have every precinct in the city. That's thousands and thousands of officers and their families. You're running for mayor, I say, good luck. I say that all these officers and their families, they're not going to forget. And that doesn't count their friends. - I understand. - And I told you that crane shot was going to be just super. When are you going to have you cut ready cause I want to see it. - Well, to be honest with you I'm not too happy with the cut right now. - No way to re shoot anything Nick, there's just so much in the budget. - Yeah but. - You get back to me this afternoon on that. - Nick DeLeon, I have a warrant for your arrest. - What's going on here? - You have the right to remain silent, if you give up to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning. If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you without charge before questioning. - Do you understand these rights as we've explained them to you? No I don't want a nod, I was a verbal response, so I repeat. Do you understand. - I understand. - Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent? - No. - Do you wish to give up the right to talk to an attorney and have him present during questioning? - No I don't. - I'm calling the shots now and you're finished. (Nick whistling) - This way. Wait here. Okay. (Nick whistling) Wait right here. Number 20 to pick up his property. (Nick whistling) - I'll drive you to your car. - Look, you didn't have to come, I thought Arthur. - Arthur had his sons school play tonight. The arraignment will be day after tomorrow. Arthur'll be there to plead you. - Right. - Have you thought about how you're going to plead? - Look I know what I did. - I know what you did to. I understand that she looks 18. I'm speaking as an attorney. Until the trial you are not to see her, ever, under any circumstances. You are to meet with Arthur and tell him everything. As far as I'm. As far as I'm concerned, I don't want to hear any of it. - Sharon I'm sorry. - Since you've already rented the place at the beach. - I'm going to stay there. Don't worry, I'm staying at the beach. - I'll go up and see Andrea tomorrow. - Why? - I'd rather she hear it from me than to hear it from someone else. (door knocks) - Maris. I'm not here to board you out, it's time for school. If you don't go to school, how are you going to stay in advanced studies? Don't want to end up like your old man, do you? I mean, I don't even understand half what's in these books I bought you? This encyclopedia, I can't even spell it. (Mike chuckles) you're gonna be all right Maris. I'm gonna see to that. I got transferred from nights, no more crumby nights, just days. So when you come home form school, I'll be there. Night time, we'll be together. - I am not your wife, I am your daughter. (dramatic music) - That's the way it's gonna be. (dramatic music) - Film student, sees lots of movies, makes movies. Might be something there. - What are you getting at? - Let's say she lives a fantasy life. - Forget it. - Nick, I'm just testing the waters. - Yeah but this is ridiculous. - You direct films, I practice law. Don't tell me what's ridiculous. - No, no, no Arthur, I'm not going to have anything to do with you trying to make her look mentally unstable, please. - Okay, we drop the fantasy. You say she told you she wasn't a virgin. - What does that have to do with this? - Legally nothing, evidence of a complainants past sexual conduct is not admissible unless she bragged about it and was untrue. That could be admissible. Part of a pattern of lying. - No, she didn't brag about her sexual experiences. We didn't even talk about sex. - Nick, you gotta give me something to work with here. - Arthur can't you win this case without crucifying her? - I don't know what I'm going to have to do. And besides what the hell do you think she's trying to do to you? - It's not her, it's her father. - Oh, what difference does it make who it is for god's sake. Nick, you're going on trial for statutory rape and I'm trying to keep you out of jail. Let's track the events one more time. - Yeah. - You met at Evan Brill's party, did she say anything or do anything else that might've given you the impression that she was over 18? Anything you haven't told me about? - She said that, she said that she was taking a college course, but that was true. - Was there any discussion of her age even indirectly? - No, no, no, no. - What else did you talk about the party? - We talked about making films and I said that you had to be there to understand about it. and she took that as an invitation to come to the location the next day. - And what happened at the location? - I let her watch for a while, she came to the wrap party. We danced a little bit. She missed her last bus home. And then we went back to my room. - The party, the location, and afterwards, and you'd never once thought to ask her about her age? - No, damn it Arthur, it just happened. We were attracted to each other. I didn't plan this. She didn't plan it. - Are you in love with her? (Marisa knocks) - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? - Just passing through. - Just happened to be in the neighborhood right? - Well, something like that, how'd you guess? - Oh Marisa. - I just wanted to tell you that I'm free. - What does that mean? - It means I'm free, It means I ran away from home. (dramatic music) - I'm gonna go call your father. - He's not home. - Well I'll find that out for myself. - No, no, no. I mean, it all meant nothing to you. All I want to do is talk to you and you run to the phone, thanks a lot. (dramatic music) - Marisa, wait a minute, wait a minute, I'll listen, I'll listen, but not in the house. Marisa. (dramatic music) Okay. Let's talk. - Marisa, I'm home. Where are you? (dramatic music) Marisa! Marisa! - I was only seven. My father had some friends over, they were some other policemen and I was supposed to be asleep, but I wasn't. I heard them talking and they were talking about my mother. - Yeah? - Yeah. And this is the first time that I realized she didn't just go away. When my father went to work, she would sneak out to bars and stuff. And I remember when she'd comes home and they'd argue about it. And after they were talking about that night. She had got into a creeps car at the bar and they just drove off. And then a couple of days later, they found her murdered. - Marisa, I'm sorry. - I know, but you see he tells me that all the time, he tells me I'm gonna end up like her, that if I look at a guy, I'm gonna end up like her. - He's just trying to protect you. I mean, I'm not saying he's doing it the right way. He's doing it absolutely wrong, but if it happened to me, I don't know. I'd feel the same way about my daughter. - I know, but I'm scared of him. - I know you are, but running away, isn't the answer Marisa. Come on, I've gotta get you home. Let's go call a cab. - After what I just told you, you're going to send me back their? - He's your legal guardian until you're 18. - So what am I now, a thing? Am I a 16 year old thing? - There's nothing I can do about this Marisa, even if I wanted to. - I know, but you see the thing is you are the best thing that ever happened to me. Really, you were, it was so exciting with us. I mean, for just a few moments, I felt that, I just forgot about the horror stories that he told. - Listen we have to take responsibilities here, okay? I have to go call your father. - No! See, I have it all figured out. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna be good. I'm gonna do what you say, and I'm gonna do what he says to. See, I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna be home every night and then I'll be daddy's good little girl and then that way there will be no more problems. - Listen let go. - No see, if we could just spend some time together, maybe just an hour or so, maybe just an hour? - No. - I mean just for an hour because I feel like if we could be just this close, just for a little while then I can put up with him. - Listen to me, calm down. - No. - Pull yourself together, come on. - No. I love you. - No, don't do this to me Marisa. - Don't you love me to? Oh please you have to love me, please, please. (dramatic music) Oh no, oh no. (dramatic music) (Marisa screams) (dramatic music) - She can't swim! (water splashes) (dramatic music) - Do you see her? - No. (dramatic music) - I got her. (dramatic music) - Keep her head up. (dramatic music) - I'm Mrs. DeLeon. - What do you want? - I suppose I simply wanted to see you before the trial. - There's still going to be a trial? I mean, even after he saved me? - Forgiveness doesn't come so easy in the real world. - I suppose that means you don't forgive me. - Should I? - I didn't try to take him away. - Just a roll in the hay. What the hell, he's only gonna wife, a family and reputation. Do you love him? One helps people one loves. Didn't you ever discus the difference in your ages? - The only thing that he ever told me was that with me, he felt young. - I see. - I went there to watch him shoot a film. He asked me to a wrap party. I called my father on the phone, I told him I was going to be late. We went in, we had some food and a couple of drinks. - Oh. - [Marisa] And it just happened. - People versus Perkins, 1982. Defendants putting his arm around 13 year old was part of his preparation for unlawful sexual intercourse upon her. Therefore he could not be convicted, both of lewd conduct with a minor. One of these days I'm gonna learn not to carve like Attila the hun. Okay. - Thanks. - So honey, would you like some sweet potatoes? Just for you, cinnamon - I'm on a diet. - Well diets don't count at Thanksgiving. - I don't want any okay? - Sure honey. - You want some, is that enough for you? - Yeah. - So have you gotten any snow up there yet? Thanks. - It got real cold. This is ridiculous. - What's ridiculous? - Pretending like we're one big happy family. You two aren't even living together and he's on trial for statutory rape. We're sitting here acting like we're the Brady bunch. - Sweetheart we're just trying to make the best of a very difficult situation. - Well I can't do it. - I'm not hungry anyway. - I just wish for one day we could forget this. - Maybe you can, but I can't. Do you have any idea what it's like for me up there? Kids look at me like I'm some sort of freak or something. And what does your dad do? Oh, he messes with 16 year old girls. - Andrea stop it. - No, I won't stop it. - Andrea, I need your support. - Oh yeah? You didn't need my support in Lakewood Canyon, did you? I'll be going to Judy's. - Andrea, please. - Don't touch me! - [Man] Are you in high school? - [Marisa] Yes. - [Man] How old are you Marisa? - 17. - And when you first met Mr. DeLeon and went to visit him in Lakewood Canyon, how old were you then? - 16. - Okay, I want you to listen very carefully to my next question. At any time before having sex with Mr. DeLeon, did you ever tell him that you were 18 or older? - No. - You're never lied to him, did you Marisa? - Your honor, asked and answered. - Sustained Mr. Berman. - I'm finished your honor. Thank you, Marissa. - Feeling all right, Ms. Vogel? - Yes, sir. - I'm glad you would have drowned if it hadn't been for Mr. Deleon. - Your honor. - Come on, Mr. Bauer, you haven't got a jury to impress and I'm not gonna go for that. - My apologies, your honor. All right, when you called your father from Lakewood Canyon, what did you tell him? - I told him that I had missed the last bus and that I was, we were staying for dinner. - [Bauer] We? - I said was with my film class. - But in fact you weren't, in fact you lied. - Kind of. - Ms. Vogel, you said you were with your class and you weren't. Is that what you call a kind of lie? - No, it was a lie but I didn't want my father to get mad. - [Bauer] Mad, why should he have been mad? - Because. Because. - [Bauer] Because you've gone off on these forbid adventures before, you've lied to him before. - Objection, counsel is not only putting words in the witness's mouth, but past actions are inadmissible. - I am merely trying to establish a pattern. - Come on gentlemen, come on gentlemen. I'll sustain that. - Let me rephrase this. In order to have any freedom at all, to have breathing space, you have to lie? - Your honor, that is exactly the same. - I know Mr. Berman, Mr. Bauer, cut that out. You'll stop this line of questioning. - My apologies, your honor, I withdraw the question. Now after you called your father. Did you join Nick DeLeon at the bar? - Yes. - You drink alcohol? - I have, hardly ever. - When you do, is it whiskey, wine? - Beer mostly. - And when you were in the bar that night, did you have a drink? - Yes. Beer. - Beer. Although you are underage, you were served alcohol. How is that possible, didn't the waiter asked for identification. Ms. Vogel, the waiter is sitting outside this courtroom. - I showed him a drivers license. - I can't hear you Ms. Vogel. - I showed him a driver's license. - [Bauer] Was it your license? - No, it was my cousin, Sandy's, she's 21. - I see. And how did you happen to have her license? - [Marisa] She loaned it to me. - [Bauer] For this particular occasion? - [Marisa] No. - Then this was not the first time? - Yes. I mean, no. - You have used her license before? - [Marisa] Yes. - Why did she lend it to you, so that you can order drinks? - Well lots of kids. - Let's not talk about lots of kids Ms. Vogel, we're talking about you. That license was a lie. After you lied to your father, you lied to the waiter. In the presence of Nick DeLeon, you produced false evidence that you were at least 21 years old. In fact you've lied to us here today. - No. - You lied. You said you went to watch Nick DeLyon make a movie. That's a lie. You went to push yourself as close to him as you could so that he could do something for you. - Your honor he's bullying the witness. May I remind counsel that he is dealing with a child? - Not by her actions. - Ease up Mr. Bauer. - Oh, it's an old, old story Ms. Vogel. Anything to get into the movies, drink with him, kiss him, go to bed with him. - No, no, that is not what happened. - Arthur, I want to talk to you. - What are you doing? - What is going on here? - Your honor, I'd just like to talk to my lawyer for a minute. - I don't know, your honor, if I might have a moment. - You know Arthur, you're really, this has gone too far. You promised me. - Mr. DeLeon. - Your honor. - Mr. DeLeon. Your lawyer will make the arguments. - Yeah, but this just isn't right. - I will determine what's right in this courtroom. I am here to receive evidence and make rulings. Your lawyer will present the arguments. - Yes your honor, I. - Mr. DeLeon you will sit down or I will find you in contempt. - You're doing it Arthur, you're really doing it. - Continue Mr. Bauer. - [Bauer] No further questions your honor. - Thank you. - [Judges] As of the hour, this court will adjourn until ten am, Monday. (dramatic music) - I know I was rough, but you've got a great deal at stake. And Monday morning, Berman's going to come at you just as hard. Nice work nailing her with that phony drivers license. I'm going to go see what's happening with our Quigley motion. Remember reasonable belief. The way she looked and the way she acted gave you a reasonable believe. - Right. - She was 18, that's our only possible defense. - Thanks. - I'll see you both on Monday. - Okay, thanks. - Right. Goodbye, Nick. - You know, I appreciate you being here today, thank you. - Don't mention it. - Are we ever going to talk about this thing? - I don't know. - Fact, I had an affair, fact, she turned out to be a minor. - Now she's a minor. - I didn't know that then. - And what if she hadn't been, what if she was 18, what would you be doing now? - You're twisting this thing all into shape. I'm trying to explain to you. - You're the one that brought it up. Answer the question. - Stop acting like a lawyer for a minute and I will. Look, she's just a kid. But she did a hell of a job playing make believe grownups. - Oh and that explains it. - Well. - I've been hurt too. And who jumped up to protect me? Nobody. - I'm sorry. - I don't want an apology. - Well, what do you want? - Don't tell me what you think I want to hear, just tell me what I need to hear. - Well what is that? Huh, what? - That's up to you. I'll see you Monday. (car doors banging) - Marisa. How about I make some of my special scrambled eggs, huh? You gotta eat something, honey. I'll send out for that favorite pizza of yours okay? Listen to me, I had no idea he was going to be that rough on you. (door bangs) (dramatic music) (Nick knocking) (dramatic music) What are you doing here? - Relax, I didn't come to see Marisa. I came to talk to you. - And you thinking that's a smart idea? - Yeah, I do. You want to hit me again? Go ahead, take your best shot. But I think you're going to want to hear what I've got to say. - What? That you're sorry? - Yeah, and something else. - Don't con me. What's this something else? - Whether or not you've lost your daughter. - Hey, the hell are you talking about? - I'm talking about her feelings. I don't know one parent who really knows what's going on in their kids heads. - What does your kids feelings got to do with mine? - They're both kids, things get bottled up in them, and hurting them and if they don't let him out. Well, I don't want to tell you what happens. You know that day on the pier? She didn't slip. I think she jumped. - Why would she jump, why? - Because she's scared of you. She was lucky, she found somebody who listened to her. Somebody who didn't tell her that her secrets we're wrong or terrible. - Yeah, who? - Me. - You? - Yeah. - Oh, and what did she tell you? - She talked about her mother. (dramatic music) You've already lost your wife. It's not too late to save Marisa. (dramatic music) I'll see you in court. - Well, we seem to have no problem with the events Mr. DeLeon. You met this girl at a party and you admit that your words could have been taken as an invitation to visit the scene of the film you were making. - That's correct. - And you bought her more than one alcoholic beverage. - Yes. - And you danced with this girl? - Yes, sir. - Lost track of the time and missed the last bus. - Yes, sir. - I have here, the motel registry previously admitted to evidence and it indicates that on that day there were several rooms available. - What are you getting at? - Was there some reason why you couldn't have booked two rooms? - Well, I suppose I could have. - You did an awful lot of supposing Mr. DeLeon. I submit to you that it was willful supposition. That your claim of innocence because of reasonable belief of her age was in fact willful indifference to her age that you lured her there for the purpose of seducing her. - Objection, he's inter closing. - Sustained. Mr. Berman, you can say all that during your closing argument. - Yes, sir. Reasonable belief that this girl was 18 years old. Look at her Mr. DeLeon, look at her. I invite the entire courtroom to look at that child and have a reasonable belief that she is 18 years old. - She wasn't dressed like that, she didn't look like that. She didn't look like a child, she looked like a woman. - The waiter asked for ID. He seemed to think she was under age, didn't you? - No. - Because you didn't care if she was under age, did you Mr. DeLeon, no further questions. - [Judge] Mr. Bauer. - Nothing, your honor. - Defendant may step down. - May it please the court, I'd like a few moments for a conference. - (whispering) I'm the only reasonable character witness. Call me. - The defense now calls as character witness, Detective Michael Vogel. - Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? - I do. - Be seated. - Are you acquainted with defendant, Nick DeLeon? - Yes I am. - Can you tell us the nature of that acquaintanceship? - Well, if you don't mind, your honor, if I could just say something, it'd be okay with you? - Well, Detective Vogel, I run a tight ship, but not that tight. Go ahead. - Thank you. First, he did it and nothing is going to change that. But I've been thinking about why all this happened. - Your honor, are we going to have a. - Yes counselor, we're going to have what we're going to have. Now I let the man speak. - What it is is, I've been telling myself that she slipped off that pier. But the truth of it is I pushed her. I mean, I might as well have. See, what I see on the street, that's my world, you know? And I don't sleep so good at night. Long time ago when Marissa was a baby. Her mother, this is very hard for me. - It's all right. Take your time. - I would go out out on duty and her mother would put the baby to bed and then she'd go out, just go out, just like that. I was out doing my job, doing my job, working, feeding my family. I found out about her, I tried to stop her, I talked to her. I argued with her, but nothing, I couldn't have any effect. One night she went out, she picked up some guy, the wrong guy and I wasn't there to stop it. So I wanted to make sure that it wouldn't happen to my baby. I was going to make sure. Well, what I did was I put her in jail. I made her just like her mother. I see what I did. I made her stop loving me. (Mike crying) I'm sorry, I was wrong. (Mike crying) I'm sorry. - Defendant and counsel will come forward and face the bench. Consent and reasonable belief are the two issues which confront me this trial. Although it appears that Marisa Vogel consented in this matter, consent is not a defense for unlawful conduct with a minor. I find that you knew, or you should have known that she was a minor and that you had a duty to inquire and verify her age. Nick DeLeon, I find you guilty as charged. (dramatic music) Do you have anything to say before I pass sentence? - No your honor. - Now the law gives me considerable latitude with sentencing in this kind of case. A warning, to up to five years in the state penitentiary. Now we have heard a request of clemency on the part of the victim's father. On the other hand, you're found guilty of the crime. The state has stringent and unequivocal laws and I am responsible for enforcing those laws. Nick DeLeon, I sentence you to three years in prison. And I suspend those three years on the condition that you preform community services as directed by this court, and that during this period you would not violate the law again. - Thank you your honor. (dramatic music) - You're free to go. We're having a short recess before we hear the case of the people versus Axelane. - All rise. (dramatic music) - Mike. That was a, well. - Forget it. - Marisa, goodbye. - Goodbye. (door bangs) - Hi. - Hi. - Are you all right? - Yes, of course. I was just doing some last minute work on a case. - Look, I hope this doesn't come out all wrong. You said you didn't want to hear just an apology, that you wanted to hear what you needed to hear, right? - Right. - You know, when we were first married, I had these great dreams and as the years went by, I traded most of them for a steady paycheck, but I held onto one. And for the last five years I've been trying to make it happen. A movie. Right, not for any client, but for me. And that night when you were preparing for your court of appeals case and the next day when I came by and I told you that I was going to quit my job. - Yes I remember it very well. - Well then you remember what you said about my little movie. I was really angry at you. - I understand. - I mean, I just, I. I didn't know if I could take any more of that non-communication and with Andrea going, I mean, I was starting to freak out a little bit about, about us squaring off 24 hours a day. The answer wasn't Marisa Vogel. Never was and it never will be. I love you. - That Mr. DeLeon, was what I needed to hear. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic chord)
