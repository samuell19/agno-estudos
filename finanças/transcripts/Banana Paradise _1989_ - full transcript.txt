We should buy a new one, mom. I know that. My left eye kept twitching. Maybe I am in bad luck. Mom, you're too superstitious. Putting tea leaves on your eye is not helping. Answer the door, Yao-Hua.

We might get into trouble. I am just saying we should try and contact them. Contact who? Take care of yourself, dad. Keep warmth. Yao-Hua. Grandpa will take care of you. Stop crying. Tonight at eight, I will call back with Grandpa. Don't let them go out. Let's go for a walk. Lung-Lung. Lung-Lung. We are going out. Take care of Grandpa for me, alright? Ok. Thanks. Bye. Mom. Mom, are you going out? We are going to Mrs. Chaing's. We are not coming back for dinner. No. You shouldn't go out now. Why? Yao-Hua said, mom and dad should stay at home. He's calling tonight. Why? It's so expensive. Young people are so wasteful. Nonsense. He must have something important to say. Wait here. He can just tell Shu-Hua the important things. Mrs. Chiang is waiting for us. Hurry. No. Dad, Yao-Hua, He has contacted grandfather and aunt in China They'll meet in Hong Kong and call you tonight at eight. They want to talk to you. You... This is killing me. How can you not have told me about this? Hell... Before this, Yao-Hua wondered why we haven't contacted the relatives in China. I told him that your identity was special. So he shouldn't try to find them. He never mentioned it. I don't know he found them. What now? I don't know. I don't know what to do. Yao-Hua said he has contacted his aunts. How many sisters does Li Chi-Lin has? How many... Yes. Tell me something more about his family. If they call, I am going to blow my cover. Then we are done. I... Quick. Think. God. Door Latch... I am not the wife of Li Chi-Lin. I was separated with my family during the war. I had nowhere to go but my old home. When I was halfway, I heard that my home was burnt down. I had nowhere to go, so I still went back. I ran. I ran. But... I met some thugs. They caught me, and tied me up with... and tied me up with... with iron chains. And they parted my hands, and my legs. I laid there. My clothes... They tore my clothes open. I was in so much pain. So painful. Thankfully Mr. Li and his classmates passed by. They saved me. I felt silly. I... I can't believe it... Then his wife died in the way to Taiwan He held the child and wept. I swore I would raise this child as my own child. And take care of him like his real mother. I did it. Yueh-Hsiang... Thanks to you for helping me. We raised him. We spend our whole lives together. Hello? Hello? From Hong Kong? What now? Don't panic. Shu-Hua. Who is it? Dad, Yao-Hua saw grandpa! You go! I can't. Me either. What now? Please come out. Hello? Yao-Hua? Coming. Damn... Grandpa, we can't hear you! Hello? Hello? Hello?
