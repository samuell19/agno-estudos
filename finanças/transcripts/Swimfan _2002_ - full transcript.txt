I spent 6 months at a juvenile hall. It was actually the best thing that's ever happened to me because they had a pool. Yeah, this shitty old lap pool that hadn't even been used in years, And I got assigned to clean it. And pretty soon, I was swimming in it more than I was cleaning it. You know, it was just easy for me to jump in the pool and forget about all the mess that Was going on around me and just swim. Yeah, when I play music sometimes, I just-- I play cello. And I just float out of my body, Up above the music where no one... Can touch me... or hurt me. I can escape. Do you want to escape? Yeah. Sometimes. But not right now. Right now I like where I am. Um... Madison, I should tell you something. You have a girlfriend. Yeah. Amy. Is it serious? Yeah, it is. She's great. She's the other reason Why I turned my life around. Story of my life.
