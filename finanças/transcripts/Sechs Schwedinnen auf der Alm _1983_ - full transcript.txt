Wherever our six Swedish girls show up, they make an unforgettable impression. Today they have arrived in Switzerland to collect an inheritance from the director of the finishing school where they spent last summer. I can't wait to find out what the old man has bequeathed to us. Whether it's a little or a lot, we're in Switzerland and going on holiday. Like the uppercrust, first class. Yes, there's nothing like going out in style. We're rather going up! Darling, we are rich actually. - Do you think so? I don't know about that. - Neither do I. Let's see. Right now though, we're broke. We only have enough money left for tickets, apples and chocolate. Does one need any more than that? I can think of something I could do with. And what do you mean by that? With all that quivering and shaking, certain nerve endings will get stimulated. It's happening to all of us. - Would you like something nice? - Yes. I just want to know what gives him that idea... The big one? - He was secretly in Engadin. - What makes you think that? He couldn't be satisfied. She always met with him. - Better than nothing. She is so insatiable. The most highly sexed of us all. Is that why she was gone every night? Come here, Sweetie. That's no substitute. - I think so too. I know he liked all of us. But him being in love with her is new to me. That could be the real reason he made a bequest to us. So the old saying is true. Love conquers all. You'll have to add: Sooner or later. - What do you mean? Better a little love sooner as later. I see. You mean, a bird in the hand... Hardly had they started to speak about birds, but a cock appears. When I just think of the fun and what kind of choices we had... I could start helping myself. - Look what's coming! Exactly my cup of tea. It's as if we summoned you. Come on. - Help! No. Come on. - Let me go! Give me a kiss. Cock of the walk - he couldn't grasp... He's trapped at last, he's come to pass. Let me, let me out... Come back. They laughed too quickly. They will see. Their smiles will soon be history. Another man should come in... Yes, real hard. Come on! Change positions. Change positions. Let me get on top, then you can shoot it even deeper into the goal. Enjoy your meal! Mate, won't you come along. You need private lessons in attacking. I would certainly be very grateful for that. I said: Halftime! Do what you want. Come on. What are you up to? - You'll see soon. Not bad. Shouldn't we all get undressed? Turn around. - Yes. Down with all clothes. It's too warm in here anyhow. A hardy football team were worn out by our six Swedes. In any event, our heroines accomplished their goal. They also accomplished their goal in Zurich, where all their dreams should come true, at least as soon as the money comes from their benefactor: It's not that far any more. We need to go over the big bridge there. And at the far end of the bridge lies the secret treasure of our Director. May he be blessed in heaven. This way. Not far now and we're rich. Where there is light, there is also shadow. An old saying. According to another: Don't count your chickens until they hatch. Well, I want to go to Arabia... What do you want to do in the Orient? Our six Swedes, thinking that they wtâ€œ soon be showered in riches, get to the office of the lawyer, who was supposed to make their dreams come true. Ladies, crying won't make the dead come back to life. First of all, you have to sign a general power of attorney to me. I have prepared a power of attorney for you. Excuse me, but you are wetting my table. - Sorry. I am your representative in this bequest. So, you must all sign over the power of attorney. Get started. The director, what a good man! He only ever wanted the best for us. Yes. Always. - Yes, the next. - Please. May I ask you to be the next? - Do you need the tissue? Greta... - I'm coming. Even though it's hard. The darling director... Thank you for the tissue. I still don't believe it. I guess it has to be like that. It's all very sad. However, I still cannot say what you're getting. The bequest is still en route. - What do you mean? - But he had promised... I don't get it. We should have got everything today! We must say that this situation is scandalous. There's no point in shouting. You'll get nothing that way. We spent everything to come here. We had planned on holidaying here and we don't even have enough money for food. It's not fair on us. - What should we do? Shall we starve? - Or become prostitutes? We don't have work permits. Let's got. - But what are we to do? - You will be to blame if... we drop down dead on the street. - I think I know how I can help you. I would advise you to spend a few days holidaying in the Swiss Alps. Don't you get it? We don't have money to be going on holiday. Listen, I want to help you. With an advance. How about that? Finally something good. I understand your situation. Believe me, I am truly sorry. We will speak about the interest as soon as the bequest is finalized. Naturally, you should enjoy yourselves now. If you kindly excuse me. I will get the advance. Please, go ahead. We have plenty of time. We are waiting for you. - You are an angel. - I am delighted. Excuse me, I am looking for the lawyer. Will we have some fun? - No sooner said than done. So... Hold on. What are you doing? Help! What are you doing to me? What are you doing? You may not do that. Have you gone crazy? What the... Help. Stop. I can't believe this! That's enough. Help! Help! Where's the lawyer? If anyone saw me like this... Get out. Put it back. Sit down. Ladies. I hope you weren't bored. No, not at all. So, which of you minds the money? - I do. Inga. So there. One thousand, two thousand. That will have to do for a start. The cost of living is cheaper in the mountains. And healthy on top of that. You need to do something for your health, eh? When you're in the right hands, you have all you need and more. For free. You can believe me. I am speaking from experience. Well then, bon voyage. Wow, that's a good feeling. Guys, we can get going. You are the best. Thank you. I can't wait. Hey, what's over there? Karl has been felling trees. Crazy, in this heat... That man is right. It's far too hot. Hey, do you see that? What are you doing there? - You're not allowed to do that in the bus. We are Swedes and we can do anything anywhere. Get undressed, you fools. Fine with me. - We love freedom. Hey, you're crazy. Wave the flag. Hey look. I have a secret admirer. Do you like me? Oh really! What a hussy, showing your bottom to an innocent little rabbit. Good bye. Ciao. Good bye, you little girls. Good bye, you darlings. Ciao. There they go. - Ciao! A well! I'm enjoying myself. - I'm thirsty. Stop. Stop refreshing yourselfs. We have to paint the Swiss Alps red! Come on. - Go in and win! Who's here? We're on our way. No hustle. We're on holiday. Come on. - Yes. Finally. - Why the hurry? Did you see the big guy? We'll come back. When I see the girls of today... What we could do together... You pig! Prick. How often have I said to you that you shouldn't be looking at other women? You should have enough with your own wife. Why did you marry me when I can't satisfy you? Calm down. That's better. - Yes, darling. - Do you want to? Yes, darling. - Then shut up. Yes, darling. Have you closed up around the front? Yes, darling, otherwise everything would be open. Now are you happy that you can fulfill your duty as behoves a good wife? Of course, darling. I want to. Everything that you want... How about a little break? Oh yeah! Look there! What a pretty sight! Everything looks so healthy and unspoiled. No wonder why Swiss cheese tastes so good. We admire them and they are amazed about us. Always the same: cows and goats. Didn't you notice the wonder bull? He's mighty impressive. The gentlemen are, too. If everything is as big on them as their bells... Get dressed, we want to move on. I'm not cold, I just don't want to get a sunburn. Who knows how long we still have to march, until we find someone who wants us. I think I see a marmot up there. Where?! - Don't move or you'll frighten it. Oh, how sweet. It's gone. There's everything here. Come on, let's see what else is happening. I think this is a lovely place to take a break. Everyone OK with that? - Yes! Tell me, do you hear that? Yes. Over there. I know how to tell who can blow well. I love men who are flexible. I love guys who can make their thing rise that high. Unbelievable. - Bravo. Tell me, how far more will we walk today? In my opinion... Oh! The rucksack. Keep a hold on it. My goodness, what am I going to do now? You don't have to jump down after it but you could have been a bit more careful. What are we going to do without our papers and our money? I knew the envelop isn't the safest place for our money. I wasn't to know that the bloody bag would slip out of my hands. Am I meant to kill myself now? - Not just yet. But what are we to do without papers and money? It gets worse. - There's a storm brewing. - Listen, that sounds like a dog. That is a dog. - I can hear barking clearly. There is a house close-by and where there are barking dogs, there are also people. Come on. - Well, at least some people... Soon it will rain... Awful weather. But we could do with a bit of rain. So let it rain. But where is Ello? Gee! A Saint Bernard! What a beautiful animal. What a good fellow. He is sweet. - Come on. - He's leading us. It's raining beautiful girls and they are coming to my house. If no-one comes in, then my eyes deceived me. Good day. That was no delusion. - I am cold. Me too. - And I am warm. You'll have to take those wet things off straight away. Otherwise you'll get your death. Here is a towel. Dry off. Many thanks. - Thank you. And when you're ready, you can have a bite with me. Help yourselves. If I had known you were coming, I'd have had more food. But you'll find it tasty. I make the cheese and sausage myself. They make you strong. Tell us, do you live here on your own? Of course not. I have Ello, my dog. Are you married? Married. Indeed not. As I told you already, I have my dog Ello. And do you get to sleep with a women despite that? Sleep with a woman? Where would I find one? You're right. Why look elsewhere? Exactly. I've been here for years and despite everything, I am in rude health. Despite everything? Don't you ever feel a need for carnal pleasure? Carnal pleasure? - Yes. - Yes, it is totally natural to feel a need for carnal pleasure. All the women around here are married. It would cause a scandal if I even spoke to one of them. No. I'd rather keep my hands off and enjoy my peace. One day one of them will wander in here and offer herself to me. And then she will experience something wondrous. Are you saying that the wonder will be big? - Yes and long lasting on top of that. We would like to experience something wonderful like that. You're only saying that because you want to comfort me. The only one who knows how I suffer is Ello. Come, Ello. It's time for bed. Into you basket with you. - We have to seduce him. He is still a virgin. - What do you think of six-fold deflowering? I'm on for it. - Quiet now. He's coming. Now we can talk on without being disturbed. You remind me of a friend who was cut off from the world, exactly like you only that she lived in a girls' boarding school. But unlike you, every night she had a friend who made her happy. - So? For this to happen, the girls who shared the room with her, knotted their sheets together so that he could climb up. And when he was up with us, we often all played together. We blindfolded him and he had to find out which body was that of his girlfriend. He had to sample everybody to be sure. His hands were all over and extremely tender. His finger tips were hot as fire. They were unforgiving. They probed tirelessly everywhere. As none of the girls wanted to be a spoil sport, they let him do it for as long as he wanted. Good friends, eh? - Yes. As they liked it? Yes. - In fact, a lot. Soon the girls couldn't go to sleep without playing their little game first. There were some variations on the game. When the fingers weren't enough, he used his mouth and other body parts. And when push came to shove, then he penetrated her so that he could recognise her from the inside. The girls found the game enormous fun. Sometimes they pulled an all-nighter. Let's retire. Ave Maria. Ave Maria, in the name of the Father. In the name of the Father, restore our faith, into infinity. Hear our call. Protect and bless us all. Hurry up. I am freezing. How long more? Things don't happen quickly here in the mountain hut. That's enough for the first time. - Come on. You don't need to scream like that. Otherwise you'll wake our children. How come she is so tired? She isn't tired. She's only storing up strength for the night. Here is your water. - I'm not so fast. You can't imagine how nice it is in here. Should I tell you the real reason our Delta is having a bath now? Just in case someone happens to come in this evening who wants to touch her everywhere, she wants to be all clean. Our Gaston looks unsettled. Go to him and calm him. Off with you. You were right. How long do you think it will take before he's tired out? From the way he looks, not long more. - Watch. Can I do anything for you? The men here are completely different. I have never experienced anything like that. - Don't worry, darling. There is no tree that doesn't fall sooner or later. Can't I do anything at all for you? - No, thank you. What torture the poor fellow is going through... Serves him right! - I can't wait to see what Lil will do. Quiet. We could have fun as well. - Yeah, make way. I also want to be clean. That's just perfect for my honey pot. That's just right. That will bring a glint to his eyes. - Sure. Hey, would you two come over here. - Straight away. For the beginning, it's alright. The best is yet to come. Are you sure? - Sure! If he doesn't bite, I'll drink out all the bath water. I love being bathed. You get so horny in the bath. Stand up. We want to be able to see. - You stand up too. Yes. However you want me... You take over now. It's happening. He's on the way. Do you want to bathe too? Pardon? - If you want a bath, we'll give you a Swedish massage. A Swedish massage? Never heard of it. Or we could scrub your back. - I think I'll go straight to bed. Good night. He finally goes to bed. He is nice and for sure he'll have a good night. No-one will believe me. I can hardly believe it myself. Ah well... I must go straight to bed before I get even worse thoughts. And what thoughts! If the girls had guessed of them, they would certainly have run off. My goodness, if I hadn't resisted the temptation... I wouldn't have known which one to take first. How could I have such lewd thoughts. I'll wash cold today. Real cold. Otherwise I could still lose the run of myself. I really needed that. I noticed. Sleep well. A magnificient beast. One of the blessings of good health. Handsome and firm. Lil, whet your appetite all you want but I'll be breakfasting now. A great dream. Gorgeous. More, please more. Heavenly. Don't stop. But that wasn't a dream, right? No, that was made of flesh and blood. Six of them. I can't keep up with that. So... I got it. "Help! Help! I am alone with six... Swedish girls... in the mountain hut..." Alright, Ello. Quiet. Just a moment. "...and need..." Yes, Ello, just a minute! "...reinforcements urgently. Hans, the Alpine Farmer." Alright. That's good. So, dear Ello, today you have an extremely important task to accomplish. Come here boy. You have to summon help. Go down to the village quickly and give this note to every man you meet. The more the better. We will be a laughing stock if we can't satisfy these six Swedes. Off with you, Ello. It's up to you whether tomorrow you have a master who is utterly worn out or a master who is tired but happy. Don't let me down. Get a move on. Off with you and hurry. You'll get a special treat today as a reward. Etta, all fired up with the thought of getting a hearty treat as reward, hurried off happily in the direction of the village to fulfil his delicate mission. As it happens, there was no other dog who knew the people as well as him. The mission was in the best hands or rather paws. Here, Ello! What a nice surprise. What are you doing here so early? I'll see soon enough if his keg still has a drop for me. Here, Ello. Here, boy. Have you anything nice? What's that? A letter? And for whom? What if it's for me? I must have a peep although I'm not the nosey type. "Help! Am on my own in the mountain hut with six Swedish girls. Reinforcements needed urgently. Hans." Six Swedes? Six?! Six... I'm coming. I'm coming. ...Swedes? I'm coming, I'm coming. - There you are, my love. Yes, that's good. You are doing great. Now, it's my turn darling. Oh, now it's my turn. Now that's better. - Yes. No one can do better. - Finally, the sixth one. Finally, a bite. I'll be damned. Are there only shoes in this water? Ello, what do you think? Another shoe. Ello, come here. Maybe you can explain it. Come here and tell me why the fish aren't biting. What have you there? Have you brought me a love letter? That would be nice. Everyone needs a bit of love now and then. So... Six Swedish girls! I'm coming. I'm coming. Hold on. Now I'm ready. Here I am. You please me well. Do as you please with me, you brute. - My pleasure. Now it's your turn, Sweetie. Finally. Good. Now I'm getting to you. You're getting me incredibly aroused. - You say that to all women. And now you. You can work on me longer. I'm the last one. But the others are not supposed to go short. Don't worry about that. - Fantastic. You are the greatest man I've ever known. Howl like you all. I'll start over again now. Enter. What is it? It's not even locked. Ah, it's Ello. Nice of you to visit me. You have no idea how bad my students are at German. What's that? A letter? "Help! Am on my own in the mountain hut with six Swedish girls. Reinforcements needed urgently." Well well. Six Swedes in the mountain hut. Lil and Inga, come here. Yes, Sir. You don't know the difference between as and than. We're sorry, Sir. That's a fail. For you too. You must learn the difference between comparative and superlative. I would say that with love one can learn absolutely anything. What do you mean? - Let's try it. It goes beyond studying. Yes, that's it. And where will we try it? - Here in the classroom on the desk. Fine. - Wonderful. Which is it: I am hornier as or hornier than Lil? I am hornier than Lil. - Correct. Good. Let's continue. So, you and Inga. Yes. Is it: I am hornier for the teacher like you or than you? I don't mind. What I would like is extra tuition in French. Preferably from you all, all at one time. Kerstin, you're missing in this round. Up here. - I'm coming. I need you right now. Should I turn around? - If you wish. It's better from the front than from the behind? It's very nice either ways. - Very good, you've done some good work. Enough. That's it for today. Now back to your places. We will practice that. But with all of us. It's a new method but for your sakes I am prepared to practice it. Hello, Ello. What are you doing here? What's that? A letter? Indeed. Help! Am on my own in the mountain hut with six Swedish girls. Is that meant to be a joke? Hello. Come here! I'm coming! Wow! Darling, come here. Am I dreaming or are you real? Let's prove how real we are with love. That's a great idea. You must each prove it, one after the other. Then I will tell you which of you proved it best. We'll start with you. That's nice. - Is that an asparagus? No, rather a banana. Very good. I can do it even better. - Then show it. You are a big mouth, so take that in your mouth. - With pleasure. Yes, fantastic, but leave something for the next one. Give me that lolly! Suck it good, but don't bite. That can't be true. You have to try hard. The first four are professionals. And I'm the biggest. Stop, you are really gorgeous. This is beyond comparison. The last one will be the first. Oh yeah, you are the best. This can't be true. Faster. - I can't. - My husband is waiting. And what about your post? - It must wait. My hands are full. - Yes. There are certain chores I enjoy doing. - Yes, do them. Until tomorrow then. Yes, that's it. Now it's time to zip. So much. Pretty much work I have to do here... But today he'll have more to do than he ever dreamt. His friend Ello would make sure of that. Ello. What are you doing here in the village? What is it? A letter? Really? Are you acting as postman today? And to whom is it addressed? Maybe it's important. Let's see. "On my own in the mountain hut with six Swedish girls. Reinforcements needed." What did I read? Six Swedish girls? He needs reinforcements? Hold on a minute. No way. Or? Ello, how nice of you to visit. What a surprise. Without your master? How come? What's this? A note. Good news or? Who needs help? "On my own here in the mountain hut with six Swedish girls. Reinforcements needed urgently. Hans." She's getting cheekier all the time. There's only one thing for it. Give her a good spanking every morning. Yes, every morning. Then everything will be fine. Why did you do that? Why did you eat the letter? Ello... - You don't know my Emma. She's a tough nut to crack. Ello, you shouldn't eat paper. You'll get sick. A good dog doesn't eat letters. Ello had a letter. Before I could get it from him, he had gobbled it. So. How was I to know that he... - You should've given him some meat to eat. You know that he always gets a steak from me, you goose. Excuse me, Madam. Hans has a problem in the mountain hut. He has written in a letter that he's all on his own with six Swedish girls and urgently needs reinforcements. You're only telling me now? - I thought that both of us could help him. That's a good idea. - So you'll come along? - I'll come straight away. What are friends for if they're not there when you need them? Think about it. Six Swedish girls. Hold on. - Ok. You're my best friend. You've got to come along. We'll take the shortcut. We'll get there quicker. Anyway I think its right and proper that good friends enjoy a bit of freedom. Yes, true. Those low lifes! Men are all the same. Pigs. They have no sense of decency or loyalty. Hopefully we're not too late. - That would be bad. We should get a wiggle on. Hans could be in real need. - There's a good chance of that. Those scoundrels! Good morning. You're arrived. No, not now, please. I am still too tired. Good morning. - I just need to recuperate a bit. I don't want to. Leave it. No. I can't. That was a wonderful night. - We're health conscious. We're going jogging. If anyone is looking for us, we'll be back soon. - Yes. Six, very sexy Swedish Sexbombs! Man, they were six right ones. That's the shortcut. Good day, Sir. Don't fall. May I help you? No. - Come here. - Allow me, I'm going up here... Do you remember me? I'm the son of old Mr Fischer. I made so much work for you with comparative and superlative. Nowadays I understand it much better as then. I've got you to thank for all that. Yes, yes. All the best. Good bye. I've got to head. Ah, my t-shirt. - Go on! Keep going. - Up the hill is harder. Up or down. Faster, please. I'm hot. But I'm not complaining. - Fine. Fine. I know. I know why you're hot. This cad! These wretched swines! That blackguard. They'll get what's coming to them. It can't be far more. - We should be able to see them from up there. I just know that we're going in the right direction. And all I know is that it's the wrong way. Don't you see the path there? That leads directly to Hans' house. You mean there... Damn it. This is no time for games. Pardon me. - Think of Hans. Maybe the poor fellow is already half dead and caught between heaven and hell. Up the slope and don't argue! This cad! This old sex maniac! Darling, where are you? He's a pig but I love him. Ello, finally you're back. The letter is gone. So you did your duty. You're a good boy. I have something for you. You earned that. Later you'll get something better. But now I've got to take a rest. And you've done a long trip. Come along. Into your basket. What would I have done without you? I was too tired to go into the village myself. You've saved my life. You're a good boy. Lie down now. Let them come along. All six of them. Now things look different. I'm curious to see who'll wear out whom. Let's go in the water. - Let's. - A freshen up will do us good. Wonderful. There are the Swedes. And wearing less than yesterday. The sun on my skin gives me a zest for life. Yes, me too. - Come here. I can't believe my eyes. - No, I see it too. Unbelievable. That's bizarre. They are in ecstasy. A once in a lifetime sight. Is there a nature boy who's longingly waiting for us? What are we waiting for? It's a beautiful day. I can hardly wait. - We here on our own steam. They should get to know me. Come on. - Of course I'll come. You're in a hurry. - The farmer is waiting for us. Too bad that there aren't more like him in the mountain hut. We could do with them. Don't turn around but we have people running after us. What a surprise. Are they still following us? - Yes. - Great. - Cool. The day is saved! You said it. - They'll be able to catch up with us, won't they? Let's go. We're home again and now let's do massages. I want to as well. I'm heading to the bath. - Me to the chair. I'm going to the washstand. - Sofa. - Dining table. And I? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. These vultures! I'm lost. No-one loves me. Is there anything I can do to help? - No. Just love me. Fine, if that's all I can do, I will sacrifice myself gladly. I beg you, sacrifice yourself. Be careful, darling. I also want to bathe with you. I'll show you how it works. No girl can do it as well as us, don't you think? Tops. Wow, you are powerful. Exert yourself. Deeper. Do you want the whole cucumber? - Yes. - You can have it. That's a good size. I enjoy it here a great deal! And up with that leg. Have you had enough? - We're just beginning. Turn. Stop. Turn. Stop. Turn. Stop. Turn. Stop. Turn. Stop. They must be coming into sight. Yes, there they are. Let's get closer. What's that? Quick. Into the stable. Yes. - Come. They are running away. Please give me the megaphone. Hello. Have you seen six Swedish girls in the mountain hut? That's the police. Let's go. What. - What's wrong? Quick. Get out of here. Have you seen six Swedish girls in the mountain hut? Hurry off. - Right now when he's lovely and erect... These stones are a hinderance. Never again... - It is futile to run away. We need to know if you have seen six Swedish girls. Why are you running away? We only want to know where the six Swedish girls are. We have something important to impart to them. That's the lawyer. Yes. - That's him. - In a helicopter. How did he find us? Hello. - Good day, Ladies. Glad to see you again. - We are delighted. I have good news for you. Can we go somewhere quieter? Yes. - What is it? - What are those deeds? I'll tell you shortly. Just a tiny bit of patience, please. I'll sit here. - Me here. - Sit by me. It's best that I read the will of the hotel manager. - Sure. - Good. - Good. "Last Will and Testament. I, the undersigned, Count Lingus of cm and Oris..." ...you heard correctly... "...bequeath..." May I ask if you happened to know the school principle was a count? No. - From where? No. There is yet another surprise. So, where were we? "...bequeath my property, the island Vulvafuckpur, close to Orgasmia..." ...in case you don't know, it's in the South Seas... "...to my beloved six Swedish girls: Kerstin, Greta, Linn, Selma, Inga and Astrid. This is my last will. Signed and sealed." Vulvafuckpur, sounds heavenly. In the South Seas. I didn't know he was a count. "...bequeath, my property, the island..." We loved him very much. - Wonderful that he showed his appreciation. Now go. It's still a long journey there. Let's go. - Ok. - Yes, we're going. Will you manage it? - Yes. And right in. I've never been in a helicopter. First time for everything. That's how the six Swedish girls finish their fairytale visit to the mountain hut and embark on their trip to the mysterious island Vulvafuckpur. There they will learn that their benefactor wasn't only a director and count but also their own father. The six mothers of the six girls never told their daughters who their father was or that they were all of noble birth. So a dream island, various surprises and many exciting experiences await the girls in the South Seas. What will come of this island they've inherited? Where men are still men and women have never been up to now like our six Swedish girls. It doesn't bear thinking about.
