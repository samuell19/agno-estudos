Damn it! Give me some socks. You scared me to death today. Get the wine. A broken mirror is not a good omen. You know the Mitkovski's granny Gjurgja, with her neck like this? She dropped a mirror once. And she stooped to collect the shards. - And? - And then... something thumped on her head and she stayed like that. I have to go to the mountain tomorrow. When will you be back? So I know what to cook. Meče might come. Bake a big loaf of bread. I'm afraid of Meče. He just looks, he never says a word. Like a frog. Why should you be afraid? The man just minds his own business. - Did you bolt the cattle? - I did. I'm going to bed. Come back to me, Damjanko, alive and well. Take a seat. Bring some cheese. - Nice cheese. - It's very hard to find. - I had to visit all the dairies. - All right, to your health. You know I haven't taken anything for myself. All I do is for you. I know, I know. All you did for Damjanko. Well, I'm a decent man. I just feel sorry for the wife, without Damjanko. Yes, yes. It's true. Times are hard, he got caught up in that nonsense. And she's young, beautiful... and alone. Someone will have to take care of her. Me up there with the army, and you here. But, let's arrange it like this. St. George's day is in a few days. I'll come with the horses. - Prepare three tubs of cheese. - Yes. Mill the flour... And it would be nice if you could find two fat lambs. All right. Then I'll see the corporal. I'll pull his ears for taking your Damjanko. - Farewell, then. - Stay overnight. No, I have to go. Others are waiting for my services. And I'll tell Damjanko not to worry. I see you're doing fine here. One more thing to ask of you. No, it's not for Damjan. If you could bring a mirror. A mirror, eh? One of those nice ones. Two fat lambs. As if they grow on trees. Ah, this life, just struggle and pain. All life, just battering. And that Damjanko. Can't he serve in the army like everybody else? I'll let the water in tomorrow. And we'll see whether it holds. Did you bolt the cattle? I'll check. Our bride prays to God for some evening dew. For some evening dew. For a baby boy. Our bride prays to God for some evening dew. For some evening dew. For a baby boy. Offspring, we didn't have. Our bride prays to God for some evening dew. For some evening dew. For a baby boy. Our bride prays to God for some evening dew. For some evening dew. For a baby boy. Let's go to the mill. To mill some wheat. - What is it, you asses? - Run, run! What are you staring at? Run, grandpa, run! - He's throwing stones. - Assholes. Grandpa, her tits are like apples! This bride of yours is just for having her legs up! If I catch you one more time, instead of the wheat, I'll grind your bones to dust. Hold this! Grandpa, heh, grandpa, grandpa. To give you flour. Go away. Shoo... Shoo... Ooooh... Hoy... - What is it, Vitan? - What do you mean what? What do you want? You're chasing people away. Are you afraid that they'll snatch your daughter-in-law? I haven't milled your wheat. The canal leaked. And who are you guarding her for? For Damjanko or for yourself? Meče! Come on, don't be angry with me. Didn't we have a deal? - What do you want? - Tomorrow is St. George's Day. - Yes. - I'll come with the horses. You get the flour ready. Three tubs of cheese. And how many times have I told you? Find two fat lambs. I'll pay you well. And I'll get you a silk scarf. There! I'm letting it go. Hold tight, so it doesn't hit in vain. Hold tight. It works. I'm going outside. What did you say? I'll wash... the shirt. Irina! Get some water so I can wash. Daughter-in-law, get me an ember to light a cigarette. - Why are you here? - Well, nice, very nice. You're shooing me away too. I came to collect the goods. Sit there. Word got around that you shoot at decent people. No one dares bring you wheat for milling anymore. Afraid for their lives. You don't let anyone in, or out. If I shoot, that's my own business. You're doomed, Vitan. And your cattle will drop dead. Ah, hey... Vitan, Vitan... You've lost your mind. You'll starve yourself to death. Or you'll have to mill stone... grass... soil. - Hey, Vitan. - Go away, and stop babbling. Go on. - What does he want? - He said, he's been to see Damjan. He sends his love. And he sends you this. You beast, you dog... My whole life has been such. A dog's life. A child gets born and then it dies. Gets born, then dies. Gets born, then dies. Gets born, then dies. Gets born, then dies. Gets born. And eventually, the wife died too. All that's left is Damjanko. Easy, easy, easy, easy. Come on, hoy, hoy, hoy... But I'm in good health, Lord. In good health and strong! Give me something to eat. What am I doing? Father. - I'll let the cow out. - All right. Irina! Irina. Father. Hello, Vitan. Let me ask you... This is for you! Grab him now. Hold him, damn it. My son Stojan came back from the army. The other boys in the village have returned too. It's time, it's time. Your Damjanko is sure to come back too. He might be back tomorrow. Tomorrow, you say. - Well then, for his welcome. - Yes. Mill my wheat by tomorrow. Yes. Greetings, Vitan. I saw Damjanko. Where? He doesn't look like himself. Have you kicked him out? I haven't. Is it, is it something to do with Irina? I know it all. I saw it all and I know it all. I saw it all and I know it all! Damjanko! Damjanko might come back. If he comes, he can change into clean clothes. If he comes, I'll heat up the dinner. You saw him? We're damned, Irina. Evil wormed its way among us. Irina! I'm hungry. Oh, Irina, Irina... If you only knew how much I love you! And how much I love Father. And I had only you two in this world! Kill me, kill me. I thought only about you there! - I will kill you! - Kill me! Kill me. There you go! Do you know? I thought only about you. How happy we would be. How you would give me kids. I was hoping... You were a bride in this shirt. You sent me to the army in this one. I'll burn everything, everything... I'll burn you alive! For the whole village to see. Let them watch and gloat. Father and daughter-in-law. Father and daughter-in-law. - Don't, Damjan! Don't. - Why not? You sent me to be a soldier. You cried. Come back to me, Damjanko, alive and well, you said. And I returned alive and well. But for whom? For whom? To find you with Father! With my father Vitan... Vitan! Vitan! Vitan... You've lost your mind. You want to destroy everything. Your son, your daughter-in-law, the forest. You've become a villain, Vitan. Destroy yourself, don't ruin this poor world! Cast your shadow forest, grow all dark my sister, let's mourn together. You mourn your leaves I'll mourn my youth. Please, kill me. Silence. We'll wait for Father. He likes a naked daughter-in-law. Why should I kill you? What shall I do after that? Kill myself. Kill Father. Or live together. Happily ever after. We'll live like this. Father just has to return. The three of us. Happily ever after. Damjanko. Translation Marija Jones
