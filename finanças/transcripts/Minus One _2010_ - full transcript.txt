(gentle piano music) (running footsteps) (explosive booming) (labored breathing) (gentle piano music) (sighs) (creaking bed) (sighing) (rhythmic breathing) * Decide to hold my dreams - Good morning, sunshine. - Good morning. (alarm beeping) - Hey, David, how's it going? - Craptacular. - [Woman] Paper and a large dark roast to go? - [David] Yep. - [Woman] Nothing to eat this morning? - [David] Nah, just the coffee. - Ah, you're killing me, never a bagel or dare you try a latte? - I like my coffee one way, dark and bitter just like Mamet. See you tomorrow. (alarm beeping) - Dude, wake up. Robert. - What? - [Young Man] Get up, man! - What time is it? - [Young Man] 8:25. - What day is it? (sighs) - [Young Man] It's Friday. (grumbles) Jesus dude. (running footsteps) - [Robert] Shit. (door humming) (squeaking) (door thumps shut) - Ah, glad you could join us, Mr. Montgomery. I have a place reserved just for you. - Rough night? - You should know. - [Instructor] You have one hour, starting now. (saw buzzing) (phone ringing) - Hey John, what's up? - [John] First Sergeant Solomon, this is Captain Brighton, prepare to copy. - Ready to copy, sir. - [Captain] Our unit has been activated. You will report to the Army at 0700 on Friday, 12, August. Bring all of your gear, we'll have a shake-down inspection. You will receive more information at morning formation. The uniform of the day will be ACU's. It is your responsibility to notify anyone else under you of the information I have just disseminated. Do you have any questions? - Do we know where we're going? - [John] No, you know as much as I do. - Roger that, sir. - [John] Do you have any other questions, David? - No, sir. - [John] Out. (gentle piano music) (phone ringing) - [James] James Whitmore. - Sergeant Whitmore, this is First Sergeant Solomon, prepare to copy. - [Young Man] So dude, did Jenny stay all night? - [Robert] Nah, she must have left after I passed out. - [Young Man] Dude, you're such a lightweight. (laughs) (phone ringing) - Yeah? - [David] PFC Montgomery? - Yeah. - [David] PFC Montgomery, this is First Sergeant Solomon, prepare to copy. - Ready to copy. - [David] Our unit's been activated. You'll report to the Armory at 0700, Friday, 12, August. You need to bring all of your gear. There's gonna be a shake-down inspection. Uniform of the day is gonna be ACU's. Do you have any questions? - [James] What if, um, you know, what if I'm over there-- - James, we can't even (sighs) start to think like that. Look at me. I can't have you thinking that way. - The last time, it was different, you know, it was just policing and that's all we ever did. The only time I saw action was when someone got too drunk on base and there was one night where some asshole was playing with a grenade and I didn't see it, I mean, I heard it. I didn't even see it and it this time, this time is, (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Robert] Hey mom. - [Dad] Who is it? - It's Robert. - [Dad] He's not getting anymore money until the first of the month. Tell him he can eat that Army food if he needs to get by. - Ray. Sorry sweetheart. So, what's going on, my son? How are classes? - Uh, they're fine. - [Mom] It would have been nice if you could have been home for more than just a couple of weeks. I'm sorry you had to take those summer courses. - Yeah, me too. - Did you need anything, sweetie? Food, money? You know your father's just being (laughs) well, your father. - No, no, I'm fine. I actually wasn't calling about anything like that. - [Mom] Well what is it, Robert? - I got a call today. - [Mom] From? - I got the call today. My units being activated. We're being deployed. Mom? Mom. - Baby no, no, no, not my baby, not my baby. - Linda, what's going on? - Okay, this can't be happening, you're in school. They can't, they can't take you outta school in the middle-- - [Robert] They can. - They can't. - Mom, they can. And they did. - [Dad] What's going on, Linda? - They're sending our baby off to war. - [Robert] They haven't told us where we're going yet. - They haven't told him where they're sending him yet. - [Dad] Military intelligence. - Ray. - [Robert] Mom, I'll let you know when I do, okay? - [Mom] What about school? - I have to go talk to my advisor tomorrow and I'm pretty sure I can pick up where I leave off. You know, they've probably done this before, right? - My God, my boy, my boy. (crying) - [Robert] Mom, stop with the my boys, okay? - (crying) Well you can have a child and you go through this and then you can tell me to stop my boys, all right? - Okay, sorry. Well mom, I have some stuff to do. I have to get some stuff together, but um, there's gonna be a thing on the 12th for friends and family and-- - That's two weeks. - [Robert] I know. - They're leaving the 12th. There's gonna be a small ceremony there. - [Robert] Do you think you guys can make it? - Okay, oh my God. (crying) - Okay mom, I gotta go, but I'll call you in a couple days, all right? - (sighs) Oh, my boy. My God. - [Robert] Mom, it's gonna be okay. I love you. - I love you too, sweetie. - [Robert] I gotta go, but I'll call you in a couple days. - Bye. (phone snaps shut) (gentle piano music) (phone ringing) - [Recording] Hi, this is Jeanie and Rachel. We can't get to the phone, please leave a message. (phone beeping) - Fuck it. - Yeah, you were so quiet that night. I remember telling myself that if I kept talking, you wouldn't have a chance to say it's getting late. - Oh, no. (sighs) I was so afraid I'd say something stupid. - We just sat there. We didn't make it to the movie. We didn't make it to dinner, we just sat at that bar, that bar. (laughs) What was the name of that bar? - Oh. Thurman's. (laughs) - Yeah, yeah, Thurman's that's right. We just sat there. - (chuckles) I didn't mind that we never made it to Davinci's. - Neither did I. (gentle piano music) - And then we just sat out front after they closed. - Yeah, I was an exciting guy, wasn't I? - It was perfect. - It turned out well, didn't it? - It turned out perfect. - La la la la la la la la-- - I got a feeling about this one. - Yeah? (coin clinks) - (laughs) Oh, how about that? (grumbles) Drink up boys. - Cheers. - Meh. (teasing) (exhales) - You know what, fuck that, all right? Cheers to my man, Bobby, kicking ass and taking names in the fuckin' sandpit. - Yeah, take care of Bin Ladin and make mommy and daddy proud. (birds chirping) (engine humming) (door thumps shut) (birds chirping) (door thumps shut) - Hi. - Hi. - Is Rachel home? - David, you can't just stop by like this. We agreed. - [David] I know. - No, we both agreed. - Jesus, I know. - She's at her piano lesson, it's Tuesday. - When's her recital? - It's three weeks from today. - Fine, I'll just-- - You'll just what? - When did the swing do that? - I don't know. I don't know, David. (laughs) There's a lot of shit around here that needs to be fixed. Would you like me to make you a list that you only do half the things on? Look, I have a lot of things I have to do before I pick her up. - I got the call. Our unit's being deployed. - Oh my God. - Yeah. I uh, I just finished calling my guys. - Is uh, is John still your CO? - Yeah. I was just heading over to meet him at the Armory to get everything together. - What about Jennifer and the baby-- - No, no, Mosley switched out of the unit a couple months ago. - That's good. - [David] Yeah. - David, I'm sorry. Is there anything that I can do? - No, no. Just tell Rachel I was here. - Do you want to go with me to pick her up? - I can't, I gotta meet John. But, thanks. - God. - [David] Yeah. - Where are you gonna be? - [David] Can't say. - Right. - You need to go. - [Jeanie] Yeah, yeah, so do you. - Yeah. (ticking clock) (TV chattering) - Hey Dean. - Hey David. - Buy you a drink? - Sure, I'll have another beer. - I was thinking something a little stronger. I'm in kind of a mood. - Mm, sorry no. Liquor makes me mean and irrational. (laughs) - Beer it is then. - [Bartender] Get anything for you, Dave? - Yeah, take a beer and another one for Dean here. - Thank you. - So, shipping out in a couple days, huh. - Yeah. - You know everyone here's gonna be thinking about you guys. - And you know how much it hurts for Dean here to think, so hurry up and get your ass back home, would ya? - I'll do my best, Frankie. - Preferably in one piece too. I don't want you taking up anymore room. I got customers to serve. (laughing) - [Young Man] Hey, watch your six man, boogie's on your tail. - Got 'em man, chill out. - If it took you that long to (mumbles) those fuckers in real life, you'd be dead, asshole. - Yeah, well hopefully for you, we won't be saying the same, soldier boy. - (laughs) Go fuck yourself. - [Young Man] You know what? After I get done kicking your ass-- - [Robert] Uh huh? - You can show your patriotism towards this country and its great citizens and go fetch us some beer. - (laughs) How about if Johnny Little Walker over here goes and gets some fuckin' beer? - What are you trying to say? The all mighty Striker Six, the God of War, can't even complete a simple mission like going to get us some beer? - I went through a grueling nine weeks of bootcamp and NIT after that, so I was gonna cut you some slack, but now I think I'm just gonna have to smoke your ass and make you run off haji mart and get us some fuckin' beer. - Boom! - Oh. Oh, guess who's hoofin' it to the haji mart now, bitch? - [Young Man] Biatch. - If you guys don't remember, I'm not even old enough to buy the beer anyway. - Oh, so take my I.D., man. They never look at it that closely anyway. Fuck they can barely speak the language, let alone read it. - You kidding? - Don't be such a pussy, man. - Honestly. Fuck. - Oh, and Striker? - What? - Watch your six. (laughs) - I'd like to update my earlier comment. Both of you go fuck yourselves. - Oh, ow! (laughing) Fuckin' dick. - [Robert] Bitch. - [Young man] Game on? - I'm in. (guns blasting) (police radio chattering) (door thumps shut) - [Robert] Fuck me. - Come here a second. Hey, hold up. What's your name? - Why, what'd I do? - [Officer] I'm not gonna ask you again, kid, tell me your name. - William Rogers. - Mind showing me some I.D.? (tires screeching) Just made things a whole hell of a lot worse for yourself, kid. Hands against the wall. - God, hey, I'm shipping out in two days, man, cut me a break. - Got any weapons or sharp objects I should know about? - No, did you fucking hear me? I'm going to Iraq in two fucking days and I can't buy a fucking beer? - Hey, watch the language. Tell me your name. - Robert Montgomery, Private First Class, United States Army Reserve-- - Cut the patriot crap. You just purchased alcohol using a false I.D. and attempted to flee from an officer of the law. - Fucking kidding me. - Hey, I said watch the language. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney (voice fades) - [David] Never figured you for a smoking man. - Yeah, I'm not usually, but given the circumstances. - You should try flossing. - What? - Flossing. It's cheaper, better for your teeth. - (laughs) You're a strange man. - If I had a nickel. - [James] Thanks for bringing the stuff. - Not a problem. - I was hoping my order would get here before we left, but I'm guessing they'll put it back though. - Yeah, I can only imagine. - Be nice if they would just give us the stuff as standard issue. - Oh, I feel compelled to remind you that you did, in fact, enlist in the United States Army. - What? You're kidding me. I thought I joined an highly efficient forward thinking group of individuals acting towards the common goal of global security. (laughs) - [Allison] Hi David. - Hey Allison. - How's it going? - Well you know, can't complain. Wouldn't make any difference anyway. - Can I get you anything? Are you hungry? - No, thanks, I just ate. - All right. Well, beer's in the fridge, help yourself if you need anything. - Thank you. - I'll get the other one. - [James] Thanks. - Someday you're gonna have to tell me how you managed that one 'cause buddy, you married way up. Throw that butt out. (door thumps shut) So how you feeling? - [James] Good, good. - Jackson finally get his shit squared away? - Yeah, he actually passed the PT test last week. - (laughs) Yeah, I nearly had a coronary when I saw that. - Yeah, Jackson nearly had a coronary doing it. - (laughs) I bet. - Man, I really shouldn't make this stuff. - So what about Montgomery? How's he doing with all this? - I haven't talked to him one on one since the phone call. I swear that kid thinks he's rolling in like Stormin' Norman. - Yeah, I remember those days. - Yeah, he's a good kid. He just hasn't had his eyes opened for him. - Dunlap. Dunlap! God damn, Dunlap! - Yeah? - Did I hear you right that the kid that you got out there is from the 951st and he's due to get shipped out in two days? - [Dunlap] That's what he says. - Shit. Bring him in here. - The kids I work with, it's kinda like that. You know, they're hard to reach. They act like they don't wanna be reached, but when it comes down to it, they just want to know that they matter. - So how do you show 'em that they matter? - I don't know. If I could tell you that, I wouldn't have a stack of cases on my desk. (laughs) Each one's different. Some of them are air tight. It's a matter of trust and you build a repore with 'em and when no one else is there for 'em, you are. Not all of 'em. I wish that I could be, but when you get that one, when you reach that one, it's, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Well I should get going. It's about time you think about reaching out to your wife, you know? - (laughs) Right. - [Allison] I heard that. - [James] Thanks. - [Allison] It was that kind of thinking that got me into my current situation. - On that note, think you can get yourself squared away in the next 48 hours? - Yeah, I guess. - Great, your confidence is overwhelming. - Yeah, I'll see you in Canada. (laughs) - [Allison] Take care of yourself, David. - I'll do my best. I mean if I can find the time between taking care of your husband and the rest of my soldiers. - [Allison] I know what you mean. I can't get this one to remember to pick up his ring from the jeweler's. - Call me if you need anything. - Yeah, will do. - [David] Goodnight. - [Together] Goodnight. (door snaps shut) (paper rustling) (phone clatters) (TV chattering) (phone ringing) - [Woman] Mr. Solomon? - Yeah? - [Woman] This is the Springfield Police Department, please hold for Officer Daugherty. (knocking) - [James] Hey, what's up? - We have a little situation. - [Robert] I'm telling you, I didn't do anything. That cop just had it out for me. - [James] God, just stop talking. What kind of a moron gives a fake I.D. to a police officer? You're lucky they called David instead of me. I would have left you here. (doors thump shut) - Now am I right in assuming that you're not looking for a big chicken dinner tonight? - (laughs) No. - No, I'm not right? - No, I mean, yes. (laughs) Wait, what's a big chicken dinner? - Bad conduct discharge. - [Robert] Oh no, no, no big chicken dinner. I am stuffed. I'm just looking for some dessert. - Well, after you. You are, after all, our man of the evening. - Oh, okay, um, well, I can tell you guys are a little rusty so I'll show you how it's done, okay? * And I made a choice * To use my voice and tell them-- * Watch and learn, boys. - Come on, let me square things away with Frankie. - My pleasure. - You back already? - Frankie. Yeah, I want you to meet a friend of mine, this is James Whitmore. - James, good to meet ya. - [James] Nice to meet you, Frank. - Please, call me Frankie like this guy does. Just like he's my best regular customer. Not even my mother is allowed to call me Frankie anymore. How is it you have the misfortune of knowing our mutual friend here? - I'm in the 951st. - Yeah, we're dropping his rank of Staff Sergeant tonight. - [Frankie] What brings you guys back around here? - Had a little situation with the kid over there. - [Frankie] And that would be? - [David] PFC Robert Montgomery. - Oh, do tell. - Well sparing you the details, Ben Daugherty let him go with a warning. He was trying to purchase with a fake I.D. He also had a choice a clash of ideals with a certain police officer. - [Frankie] Dunlap? - Uh huh. - Why am I not surprised? - (laughs) Yeah. Listen, kid's gonna find one way or another to get his hands on something. I'd just rather it be with a little supervision. - You gonna keep an eye on him, right? - An eye and a foot, if necessary. I appreciate it, Frankie. - It's the least I can do for you guys. - Montgomery. Private. Montgomery, this is Mr. Townsend. He's gonna be taking care of us tonight. Say thank you. - [Robert] Thank you, Mr. Townsend. - Tell him how well behaved we're going to be. - School boys, sir. - Well just make sure it's not the boys who always end up in detention. - Thanks, Frankie. - Thanks, Frankie. - Thanks, Frank-- - That's uh, Mr. Townsend to you. - Thank you, Mr. Townsend. - May the road rise to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face and may the rains fall softly upon your fields and until we meet again, may you always feel the love of this place. (speaking foreign language) (glasses thump countertop) - [Frankie] How about a couple of beers to wash that back? - Sounds good. - I've got some unfinished business to attend to. Thanks. - Hey, I almost forgot, Marilyn's at it again. - [David] On a Wednesday? - She's starting to rival you for best regular customer. - Be back in a minute, I gotta say hello to someone. - Take your time, I'll keep an eye on Casanova over there. (laughs) - [David] Hi Marilyn. - David. Sit your wise little ass down, honey, and have a drink with me. - So, what are you into tonight? - Just a little date with my old friend, Jack. - Been seeing a lot of him lately, have you? - More than I might like, but he's always there for me. - Fuckin' A. - Don't mock me, you little shit. - So how you really doing, Marilyn? - You know how it goes, David. Pretty much a class A cluster fuck. But me, soldiering through. - Huh. - [Marilyn] Fuckin' right, huh. - Not spending too many nights at home, huh? - Why would I? I don't have a dog at home to feed. - [David] Do you want one for a while? - (laughs) Jesus, David. First you can't keep a wife and a kid around, is your dog sick of your shit now too? - (laughs) No, actually nothing like that. I'm going on a little vacation. I thought you might like the company. - Where are you going? - Somewhere sunny and warm. - Really? - Oh yeah. Best sand storms you'll ever see. - Gotta love that free airfare. - So many perks. - Too many to mention. (sighs) You got everything squared away? - Stopped by the house. Jeannie was there, but Rachel wasn't. - [Marilyn] So what the hell are you doing here? - It's a long story. But uh, ended up here with a couple of guys from the unit. - That's great. That's your bonding. It's not like you're gonna be spending any time together. How's Jeannie? - Well you know how it goes. It's more confusing than the sandpit. - You looking forward to things being simple again? - You need another drink. - You're goddamn right I do. - Well, I'll see you when I see you. - You know where to find me. David. - Yeah? - [Marilyn] I'm not the one you should be asking to watch your dog. (ice clinks) - Send her another one, would you Frankie? - [Frankie] You sure, Dave? - Yeah, make it a double. - [Frankie] Got it. - [Robert] Two days, can you believe it? Two more days and we're loading up in that C47. - Yeah, two more days. You think that'll be enough time for your balls to have finally dropped? - What's that supposed to mean? - You need to get your head straight. And we're not leaving on a C47. We're taking a civilian flight to Germany. - I know, I'm just saying. - Yeah, you were just saying. You were just talking. That's what you do, you just talk, you don't think. - [Robert] Army doesn't pay me to think. (laughs) - Is there an original fuckin' thought in that head of yours or is this what you do? You just quote lines from movies? - Forgive me for believing in what we're doing. - Tell me, what exactly is it that we do? - We go, we secure, we mow down the first fucking camel jockey we see with a cellphone in his hand-- - Oh that's what we're doing? That's what we're gonna be doing, huh? - Keep it simple, stupid. KISS, you've heard of that, haven't you, Sarg? - All right, guys. - Haven't you, Sarg? - All right. All right, just relax, all right, take it easy. Let's just drink our beers, all right? After all the trouble I went through to get it for ya? These last two days are gonna go by like two minutes. So just sit back and enjoy it. - All right. (mellow music playing) So where's the nearest strip club? - (laughs) are you serious? - Thought maybe you could go for some of that right now. This place is dead. And uh, I appreciate it and all, but honestly, only ass I'm gonna see here tonight is your two guys and uh, quite frankly, I don't subscribe to the whole don't ask, don't tell side of things. - Yeah well, for the last time, we're not going to a strip club. - I'm not gonna spend my last two days here, okay? I can't buy beer at the haji mart and I'm with two guys who have some strange phobia about making brats. - You can't buy beer where? - Haji mart. - Mm, do you know what a haji mart is? - Fuckin' 7-Eleven. - No, you dumb shit. You have no fuckin' clue what it is, do you? - Why don't you enlighten me? - Now why would I wanna do that? - Because you're my sergeant. - Well when we get there, you can find out for yourself and until we get there, stop talking about shit you know nothing about. - What if when we get there-- - What if, that has got to be the most useless question on the face of this planet. What if I want you to shut your fuckin' mouth and try to learn from someone else for a change? - All right, man, take it easy! Save some of that angry shit for haji, okay? How about you save it for when you come back and you find out that Jodie's been giving it to your wife. - [James] What did you just say? - All right, all right, that's enough, Private. - You have been so hell bent on telling me how it's gonna be, but you know what? Let me enlighten you for a minute. - [James] Do you want your ass beat inside or do you want it out? - All right, guys, why don't we just step outside and get a breath of fresh air, all right? All right? - After you. - That's right, after me. That's where you're gonna be when all the action takes place, right? Behind me? (door clatters) You know what your fuckin' problem-- - Don't you ever disrespect my wife! If you ever talk about her like that again, I will break you, do you understand? You think you're so fuckin' bad. You're not a mystery, you little shit. I know you. You're mommy's boy. You joined little league so daddy could come to see how tough you were, but only he couldn't make it to the game. - Get him outta my fuckin' face, man. - James-- - No, no, no, this is exactly what he needs. Poor little Robert, never good enough for daddy. - All right, come on, guys. - I am fucking sick and tired of you talking shit about my family. What the fuck do you do? Work your fuckin' yuppy job. You got your shiny shoes and you walk around and spit shit in people's faces just to see how they'll react. You know what, you keep a family together for 20 years and then you find me and we'll fucking talk about little league then, okay? Because as of now, you don't know a fucking thing! Okay? - Let's go get in the truck. - Hey, I don't need your help, but thanks. - All right. - Lover's quarrel. - Just keep on walking. - What'd you say to me? - Just keep walking. - Fuck you, asshole. (laughs) - [David] Yeah, you'd probably like that, wouldn't you? (grunting) (police radio chattering) (radio beeping) - This is Dunlop, I'm near that location. - [Dunlop] Brighton? - Yes. - [Dunlop] Last door on your right. - Thank you. I'll deal with you in a minute. Good evening, Sergeant. - Evening. What is it now? Major General? - [John] Right, I should be so unlucky. - It's good to see you, John. How long's it been? How's Lori? - [John] Oh you know Lori, keeping me in line, still. - Yeah, well somebody has to. Sit down. - So, give me an idea of exactly what it is I'm walking in to here. - Oh, my fearless deputy, Barney Fife, he's making his rounds, keeping the streets safe. He goes past Frank's and sees a fight going on in the back entrance. He steps in to break it up and somehow, catches one in the eye. - Oh shit. Was it from one of mine? - Funny thing, no one's really owned up to that. - And this is the guy that brought Montgomery in earlier? - [Sergeant] Yeah. It's funny, huh? - Yeah, it's funny. Has anyone pressed charges? - Nah, best I can figure, Solomon and his men are trying to resolve some differences amongst themselves. Some civilians heading out of Frank's, they see it going on and-- - [John] And you know how that goes. - Yeah, that's how it went. Could have been a lot worse. But thank God Barney was there to save the day and since everyone is saying someone else hit the officer, nobody wants to press any charges, but my guy still got popped, so. - So, here we are. - Here we are. You know, John, nobody wants this to get messy. I took care of everything. If you ask me, this is just what those boys needed. - Thank you, Ben. - No problem, John. You just bring those guys back home safe. - [John] I'll do my best. - I know you will. (chuckles) Just don't bring 'em back here tonight. - Fair enough. (laughing) - Dunlap! Dunlap! - On your feet, let's go. Montgomery, Whitmore, wait outside. Thank you. 'Cause I was way too comfortable sleeping in my living room with the game droning in the background. And Ben tells me this isn't the first time he's seen you guys tonight. - Yeah, about-- - Do I even want to know? - Well actually, it's pretty funny. No sir, you do not wanna know. - Well you three are pretty goddam lucky. Now I gotta let Ben win next time we play golf. - Gives a whole new meaning to support the troops. - They at least hold their own? (chuckles) - Yeah, yeah, I mean, I knew Montgomery was full of piss and vinegar, but even Whitmore was a little impressive. - [John] Could have been just what they needed. - Yeah. - [John] Too bad though. - What? - Shoulda called me earlier. Would have loved to have seen it. (laughs) I hear Marilyn was there tonight. Maybe you should go by and see Marcus. Might be a good thing for all three of you. - Yes sir. - I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Tomorrow, yes sir. (crickets chirping) - Who's this? - Remember that woman at the bar? This is her husband, Marcus. He's my friend. - What happened? - Marcus and I, we were attached to the First Infantry Division. You know, round up any POW's, assist in transfers, and uh, we were making the push up to Um Kasar. Tuesday morning. Some of the most amazing sunrises and sunsets you'll ever see. Nighttime is just stars from one end of the sky to the other. What a fuckin' waste. So Marcus and I were called up to the front of the line and there's these two fuckers sitting right in the middle of the road. I take one, he takes the other, you don't think about it beforehand, you know, which one you're gonna take, you don't think about it before. So Marcus is making his way up and he's got a shotgun and I got my sidearm. There they are, just sitting in the middle of the road, on their knees, they got their arms up and they're just waiting for out. So Marcus takes the one on the right first and he shoulders his weapon. Just as he's leaning down, this fucker reaches up and grabs him and Marcus is yelling and then this fucker's yelling at him. This other fucker, he takes off, right, so I'm yelling at him to get on the ground and then I look back at Marcus and then I see it. You know, this asshole's got a grenade and he does not plan on being a detainee. So Marcus, he's trying to get a hold of him and he sees the grenade and he's got this weird look on his face, it's like he knows. This is it. And then, limbs flying, blood, there's lots of blood. He hung on for about a year and then I guess he'd just had enough. He died during his 9th operation. (sighs) So every time I see Marilyn, she gets a drink. - What happened to the other POW? - I took him out. There's two things they never prepare you for, everything else you learn pretty quick 'cause if you don't, you end up dead or you end up like Marcus. They never prepare you for leaving or coming home or how to deal with feeling guilty about coming home and missing it. Come on. (crickets chirping) (clock ticking) (humming engine) (door thumps shut) - [Robert] Thank you. - Well, enjoy tomorrow. We are officially at D-Day, minus one. You let me know if you need anything. - [Robert] Okay. Well I'll see you guys at formation. - We got one more stop to make. - What's up? (engine rattles) (engine humming) (keys clatter) You know, I think we've pretty much used up all our favors for tonight. - Relax. Come on. - [James] Shit. (doors thump shut) (humming traffic) - You ever use one of those for this before? - [James] No, I can't say that I have. - It's pretty easy, I don't think I gotta give you any instructions. (sighs) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What the hell's going on? - I didn't really think you were gonna do it. - You just told me to. - And I was just checking. - Jesus Christ, okay. (mumbling) - All right, all right. I actually need your help. You have used a flashlight before, right? - Is that right? - All right, all right, shine it right there. All right, let's go. - What? Jesus, you really love your coffee, don't you? - Let's go! (door thumps shut) (engine rattles) (engine humming) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (alarm beeping) (sighs) (alarm beeping) (thumps alarm) (sighs) (gentle music) * Even if you don't remember us * * You're everything I wanted Hey. - Hey. - Hey David, you're in early. - Wouldn't wanna miss the favorite part of my day. - Oh, how sweet. - Yeah, isn't it? - It's a tough one today. - Who comes up with these questions? - Stumped? (sighs) - Everything's squared away, so I can pick up right where I left off. - So where would you like to eat tonight? There's a nice little Mexican place next to the hotel. - Actually, I was planning on doing something with my friends tonight. So we can eat early, if that's okay? You know, it's like a surprise party, but not really a surprise. - Whatever you want. - Is dad, - Well he, work has been very busy with him lately. I don't know, Robert. - It's okay, mom. - No, it isn't. - I know. (birds chirping) (door thumps shut) (door thumps shut) (garage door humming) (engine rattles) - You know, you can invite your friend, Jenny, with us tonight. I've never met her. This Mexican place oughta be pretty good. They say that their Jalapenos will make you sweat in three seconds. (door thumps shut) (airplane humming) (engine humming) (door thumps shut) - [Rachel] Daddy! - (laughing) Hey kiddo, how was your piano lesson? - I got a dinosaur sticker. - You did? That's great! - Honey, why don't you go put your piano books away. - [Rachel] Okay. - So what, you want me to give you that list? - I had that one coming. - Well since you're here, there are a couple other things. There's a couple boards on the deck that keep coming up. - I can do that. - [Jeannie] Are you sure? - Yeah. - Yeah? - [David] Yeah. - Okay, I'm just gonna go inside and check on Rachel. - Okay, I'll finish up out here and I'll get started on those boards. - [Jeannie] Okay, do you want something to drink? - No, no, I got coffee in the truck, but thanks. - Okay. Or, you know, you could stay for dinner. I'm sure Rachel would love it. - Yeah, yeah, it'd be nice to have dinner with her. - Okay, I mean, it's just lasagna, of course. (laughs) Her favorite. - Sounds great. - [Jeannie] Great. (gentle strumming music) * I can't remember how I got here * * I've got a hazy memory * I need to rest my aching head * * On your pillow and blankets * Maybe if I could fall asleep * My love will come back to me * This cannot be happening (animated party chattering) * I'm losing you, losing all our memories * - [Man] The same questions that I get from my mother every time I go home, oh man. My mother's upset over the fact that I am divorced. Every time I go home, same question, when are you gonna get married again? When are you gonna get married again? When are you gonna get married again? When ma, when? When the pope has a saint at the Ponderosa on a Good Friday, back off, all right? (audience laughing) * I need someone to comfort me * The tears are rolling off my cheeks * * Maybe if I could fall (music fades) * - Hey you, where you going? - I have an exam tomorrow. - Okay, I thought you would, - Goodbye, Robert. (distant music) (people chatting) - Bye. (door thumps shut) (TV playing) - Okay. It is time for bed. I mean it this time. - Can't we watch one more? - Rachel. - Please? - No, it's bedtime, come on. - Yeah, listen to your mom, kiddo, okay? - But I wanna stay down here with you. - I know you do, but it's time for bed and plus, I'll see you tomorrow, right? - I guess. - Well I don't guess. I will see you tomorrow. - Okay, love you, Daddy. - Love you too, sweetheart. (keys clinking) - Are you leaving? - Well yeah, I mean, I just thought that, - Oh. (laughs) Yeah, okay. David, what are you so scared of? Don't you think that I'm scared? I am so scared for you. I'm scared for her, I'm scared for me. I mean, what if you don't come back this time? You know what? Just go. God, how dare you. God, how can you go there and fight? And we're right here. David, I am right here and you can't face this. - I don't know how to-- - [Jeannie] (sighs) Just leave. - Look, I just-- - Just leave. (gentle strumming music) * I waited for our house, our house * * I've made it my, mine * No speak, no sound, sound * I've waited for hours (gentle strumming music) * But I'm not awake, I'm not awake, I'm not awake * * I must be dreaming * I'm not awake, I'm not awake, I'm not awake * (ticking clock) - [Man] Major, we have our troop movement orders ready and available. - All right, gentlemen, let's have them do their final goodbyes and we'll do a final headcount as we get on the bus to head to the flight line. - Roger that, sir. - [Woman] Sir, the vans are ready. - Excellent, let's make this happen, gentlemen. - I picked up your ring from the jewelers. - You know what? Keep it, I'll get it when I come back. - Take care of him. - I'll do my best. Call Jeannie if you need anything. See you in the van. Private. Robert. - First Sergeant. - Could be stuck in traffic. - Yeah, probably. - Listen, - Mom. - Oh my boy. (laughing) - Oh mom, this is First Sergeant Solomon. First Sergeant, this is my mom. - Please, David. Pleasure to meet you, ma'am. - Nice to meet you too, David. You're gonna watch out for my boy, aren't you? - Yes ma'am, I'll do my best. And you must be Mr. Montgomery? - Yes. - You should both be very proud of your son. - Yes, we are. - I'll leave you to say your goodbyes. See you on the van. (claps back) - You let us know where we can send you some real food. I imagine you'll be sick of those Army meals. (sighs) - Well I want to introduce you to my sergeant. - Daddy! - Oh. Oh hey kiddo. - [Rachel] I like your outfit. - Oh. (laughs) Thank you. - [Rachel] So when are you coming back home? (chuckles) - I don't know. - I brought you this just in case you get homesick. - Did you make this? It's the best thing I'm gonna be taking with me. - Are you scared, daddy? - Yeah, a little bit. - [Rachel] I was when I went to summer camp. (chuckles) I wish you didn't have to go. - Me too. - [Rachel] I love you, daddy. - I love you too. Thank you. (doors squeak) - You have to go. - Mm, yeah. (crying) I'm coming back. - We'll be here. (crying) (gentle piano music) (doors squeak) (door thumps shut) - Captain, first squad's secured, ready to move out. - Excellent job. You ready? - Let's do it. - Let's go then. (door thumps shut) - I gotta ask you something. - What? - What in the hell were we doing at the coffee shop the other night? (laughs) - Well, after they close, they put the trivia up on the board for the next morning. They don't know how, but I get it right every morning. - And you're just leaving without clearing your conscious? - I'll tell her when I get back. (gentle piano music) (gentle strumming music) * Today I got the call * That changes it all * I need you to understand * That I made a choice to use my voice * * And get up and take a stand * For you * If something happened to you * I wouldn't be the man who said I do * * So I'll go for now * Save my place until I return * Inside I know, I know it burns always * * Know I'll be standing guard * And watching from afar (gentle strumming music) * I'll keep you safe from harm * Brothers in arms * You were always there for me * And if I come to call * Your hero will fall, but I'll leave you the memory always * * If something happened to you * I wouldn't be the brother that you knew * * So I must go for now * Save my place until I return * Inside I know, I know it burns brother * * Know I'll be standing guard * And watching from afar (gentle strumming music)
