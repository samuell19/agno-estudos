EVERYBODY LOVES JEANNE You're an extraordinary woman, Jeanne. You're amazing. You do amazing things. It's a simple process. Marine currents allow this basket-like structure to harvest microplastics. The structure itself is made with recycled plastics and waste. We placed a camera on the structure, providing a live feed to track its progress. We expect to harvest 30 to 50 tons in our first month. We're about to launch. You're a heroine! You do useful work! What did the journalist say again? What if I call you Woman of the Year? Woman of the Year? Woman of the Century! PLASTIC IS NOT FANTASTIC Are we sure about that outfit? Might want to change. It's a bit much, sunglasses and all... Dressed to impress? Your jacket hides a toothpaste stain. And those shoes! So loud! You're all we hear! Clack, clack, clack! See that bus? You could jump in front of it. Jump, jump! Go on Jeanne, jump! Jump... Why so tempted? Because you're a failure? Shut up. Gonna cry now? Not so clever now, are we? You're paying for your arrogance, Jeanne. What if I call you Woman of the Year? I'm amazing. - That's a bit much. - Liar! What happened to the Woman of the Year? I know you want to smoke. That's bad. Causes cancer. Cancer of the throat! Dring! Cancer of the lungs! Dring! Cancer of the throat . Cancer, emphysema... If you die now, what'll your grave say? A true fiasco. Laurent, can you tell us what happened in Le Croisic today? It's complicated. Nausicaa's structures are held together with titanium wires. During the inauguration, the wires broke. Here we see Nausicaa's founder, Jeanne Mayer, diving into the water to save her baby. A beautiful but pointless dive. The structure weighs many tons. Right. And the water's weight pushes it down. We're seeing footage from the camera on the structure as it sinks in real time. Very dramatic footage. Sure, just keep filming! FIASCO IN LE CROISIC: NAUSICAA SINKS LIKE A STONE SONIA HAMI LAWYER AT THE PARIS BAR I'll be straight with you. You're verging on personal bankruptcy. You need to liquidate. That's the only way. Sell everything off. The creditors will be all over you with your plastic machines. Anti-plastic machines. The project's still viable. New investors are interested. I'm not saying it's all over. I'm simply saying you had income, and now... your income has dried up. The investors all pulled out. - You missed a teeny-tiny clause. - I read it. You read it? OK. It says you're the sole guarantor. Meaning all those nice people who invested in your project won't be nice anymore. And the bank won't help. As I always say, banks loan umbrellas in the sun. You're heavily in debt. I've seen clients go from a sprawling mansion to a shoebox. That won't happen to me. Can you pay your rent right now? Right now is tough, but my landlord understands. OK. And your parents? Our... father died years ago and our mom, last year. Ah, I'm sorry. Well, then... Did she leave you anything? Yes. An apartment in Lisbon. Not bad! Is it in both of your names? Yes. She put it in our names before she died. Great news. Excellent news! - A great lead. - Yeah, it's awesome. Next she closed her bank accounts, cleaned out her fridge, took out her garbage, tried to call us in vain... then jumped off a bridge. I see. That's awful. I'm sorry. Maupassant called suicide "the courage of the vanquished." Listen, sell the apartment. I don't know what it's worth, but even if you split it you'll make something. You don't really have a choice. We're not selling that apartment. Why not? We could. - No. - Yes. Jeanne, obviously we should! I'll let you kids figure it out. Let me know what I owe you. Honey, I'm too expensive for you. I'll do you a solid since I know your brother. - Thanks, Sonia. - My pleasure. - Call me anytime, OK? - Thanks. - Goodbye. - And good luck. She's dramatizing. Typical lawyer. I'm not on the verge of personal bankruptcy. - Want me to loan you money? - No way! - You can move in with me. - No need for that. So what'll you do? I'm not sure. Danish investors are interested. - I plan to... - You'll end up in jail. Being in debt is serious! I won't go to prison. I did nothing wrong. You did. OMG, he's right! You'll end up in jail! They'll make you scrub toilets with your hair, Goldilocks! You have no choice. Go to Lisbon, clear out the apartment and sell it. I could take a few days off. I can go alone. C'mon, Zuzu. Here. - I bet you'll call Vitor. - No. Sure you will. I feel like a mafia don. "A little somethin' for you, doll. Take it. - "It's all yours." - I'll pay you back, Simon. No. I wanna be in the papers too. "Thanks to her broke brother, Jeanne Mayer resurfaces and saves the oceans." Could you buy my plane tickets? Sure. Here. 6745. To be used sparingly, please. I'm just a humble physiotherapist. Shall we? Thanks, Simon. - Will you be alright? - Yeah. Call me? Bye. - See you. - Bye. HOTTEST SEPTEMBER ON RECORD What'll we do? We're all gonna die! When did you last have sex? Dream or real? Does the subway count? When a man brushed up against your right breast? Remember? When he realized, he yelled, "Oh no!" like he'd stepped in dog shit. Ring a bell? Then he called you a slut. Then he called you a slut. It rang out in your head. Slut. SLUT Slut! Get off your high horse. You'll have to steal too. You had income, but your income has dried up. You're broke. You're poor! That guy looks weird. With your luck, he'll be sitting next to you. That's what you get for staring at people, Jeanne! Oh no! He'll want to talk to you. You make me crazy, Jeanne! May Day! Beep, beep! - May I? - No! Sure. Let's observe this individual's approach. Sorry, I forget your name. Maybe because I don't know you. And pow! Nice one, Jeannette. Jeanne? Jeanne Mayer? Yes. - Wild! - I know you? You don't remember? French High School in Lisbon? No clue. How crazy is this? Everybody was in love with you. - Not at all. - Yes. - No way. - Seriously. When I got there everyone said, "See that girl? That's Jeanne. Everybody loves her. "Everybody loves Jeanne." My only friend, Manuel Erkin... - Remember him? - No. Little Peruvian guy. No neck. Silky mustache. He said it with tragic resignation. "Anyway, everybody loves Jeanne." You don't remember? With his accent: "Eberybody luffs Yanne." We should take a picture... for all your old fans. Don't be silly. It'll be nice. Who'll you send it to? We'll create a group. This doesn't take photos? So wild. Jeanne Mayer... Mayer, may I! Last call for passenger Jeanne Mayer. Please come immediately to Gate M23. What? They told me M48. And I don't get called? What am I, chopped liver? Did you forget my name? It's Jean. Jean, Jeanne. Funny, right? Hello. You're the last ones. I didn't check, but I guess. We're good to go, thanks. What do you do? Something cool? I run an environmental research project. Wow, that's cool for sure. - What's it called? - Nausicaa. - Come again? - Nausicaa, the Nausicaa Project. Sounds familiar. I've heard of it. What's the aim? We make eco-autonomous structures to remove microplastics and other waste from the ocean, using the ocean currents. Amazing. What's the name again? Nausicaa! The Nausicaa Project! Nausicaa? Sounds so familiar. - It's OK if you don't know it. - It is? Never heard of it. - That's my seat. - Sorry, sir. You guys can sit back down. Thanks. Anyway. In any case, you're not disappointing. Compared to what I imagined you'd become... back then. It's funny, I always thought you'd die young. I'm so glad you're still alive. That's my seat, sir. Oops, no. Sorry. Sorry, where's 11? Right there, Sir. And now, a little test. Will you: (A) take the gross but free sandwich? (B) turn it down. You're not hungry. (you'll regret it) You choose not to eat the sandwich. Bravo! You're an adult! Bonus: Imagine your seatmate's a terrorist and order tomato juice. Tomato juice! The drink only drunk on airplanes! Jeanne? Have a good flight. Jeanne! Don't forget Portuguese time. Right. One hour earlier. We're hurtling toward the past at 500 miles an hour! Welcome to Jeanne Airlines. You're on Flight JM212 to the city where Mom died. Last time you took a plane was right after Mom died. You and Simon went downtown. Tourists everywhere. You'd forgotten the beauty. You couldn't find the police station. Construction everywhere. That night, you fainted at the corner of Travessia de Terreirinho and Largo das Olarias. You found the police station. A flashing light bounced off the walls like a disco ball. They said a cab driver saw her jump off the bridge. Simon went to identify her. You went back to the apartment. +33... French number. Then 6... 63... 14... 27... 87. - You'll call me? - Yes. Waiting for someone? No. Kind of. Jeanne! Hey! Hi, Jeannette! - Nice trip? - Yeah. - No kiss? - Sorry. This is Jean. Vitor, Jean. Nice to meet you, Victor. - Vitor. - Victor, right. Vitor. I said Victor. V-I-C. No. Yes, V-I-C-T-O-R. No, no. Never mind. The French always get it wrong. What makes you say I'm French? - Who's this guy? - An old friend of Jeanne's. He's handsome, he really is. You're very handsome, it's true. Nice smile, nice beard. Not one of those flaw-hiding beards. Yours highlights attractive features. Beautiful. The beard of a Greek statue. I could sculpt you! I'll be going now. I'll let you call me for the drink you promised me. And I'll let you choose, since you know me well. - Bye, Victor. - Bye. Bye. Where were you? This is a hotel now. How sad. See? Construction everywhere. - See? - Damn! It's getting impossible. Will you be OK in the mausoleum? It's sad, coming here alone. I didn't have much choice. Can I come up for coffee? No. I no longer have any desire to sleep with you. Me neither. Big head, much? - Thanks for the plant. - It's not for you. Call me? To think I told that guy I loved him! Well, he said it first. I was just being polite. First floor. Scent of bleach. Second floor. Horrible. Scent of hair and whiff of toast. In a cognitive glitch, you imagine toasted hair. Third floor. Scent of cold meat and cigarettes. Last floor. Scent of Mom. MY CHILDREN, I CAN'T... MOM Remember, Jeanne? Your mom was always thrilled to see you. In her German accent: "Honey! "So happy to see you! Did you gain weight? "Give me a real kiss! Do I disgust you? "Wine, honey? "I got 2 bottles. You drink so fast. "Impresses me every time. "I'm happy you're here. You rarely come. "It's been ages. I barely recognize you. "Your hair's long! You look tired! Sit! What's the rush? "Got a boyfriend? That glow is new. "How's your complicated job? I just call you a garbage woman. "Cause you handle garbage, right? "I got dessert for you. "No sugar for me! That stuff kills. "You don't want it?! "You always push my buttons! "You have such a knack for it! "Sun is bad for your skin. "Worse than cigarettes. "Careful. Men are violent. "They have impulses. Be wary. "Beware other women. "They steal the men you love. "Don't be paranoid, though! "Careful with money! "Watch your weight. "I put the sport machine in your room. Hope you don't mind. "You never come anyway." WASTE HARVESTED: 0 Dammit! Stop tossing your trash! I'll call the cops next time, you old bag! I've had my fill of your crap! Superficiality is of another generation. You, Jeannette, are a modern woman. You travel. Have a career. Do conference calls. No need to love your breasts, your ass, your legs. 'Course not. Screw that. Doesn't matter. You're a modern woman. Obsessing over your ass while the world burns is obscene! Why didn't you answer her call? Or call back? It's easy to dial a number. Why didn't you answer? Why didn't you call back? It's all your fault. She'd be alive if you had. It's all your fault! The number you dialed is unavailable, probably since the person died because of you. Before noon is alcoholism, Jeanne. Wino! Stop harassing me, Ma'am. I told you I'm not interested. - Is this Jean? - Yes. I am Jean. Did you happen to take my tote bag? Your tote bag... Yes Ms. Mayer, we have your luggage. No ID tag, I see. Shirking airline rules? Shame on you. Can you give it back? It's full of cigarettes and important stuff. OK, where are you? I'll send you the address. - OK, see you soon. - OK, bye. - Still dropping me off? - Of course. Think I'd abandon you? - Dunno, maybe. - I'd never do that. I'd sell you, not abandon you. - Right here! This is it. - OK. - Wanna keep the helmet? - No. I won't pick you up, you gotta walk home. - Everyone ready to sing? - Yes! Good. What's the song about? A woman who flies planes. And what happens to her? Her plane is lost. She has no radar. What? Her plane is lost. She has no radar. Hello. One large coffee. Jeanne! How are you? You shine like the sun! - Jeanne Mayer! - Hi. Thanks. Very kind. I was just leaving. - But you can stay. - No, no. So Jeanne Mayer grew up here? I can picture all those boys making an effort to dress nice. Knowing they'd be in your neighborhood. Times have clearly changed. Not at all. See? Don't they look happy? She looks very happy. She just shopped. And this mom here, with her empty buggy. Beautiful, right? I love these perfect scenes. I find them soothing. I'm meeting a real estate agent. - You're selling? - Yes. I'm interested in buying. Really? And I love this neighborhood. It's a 3-bedroom, but it's huge. Sorry it's a bit of a mess. I'm clearing it out. This place is amazing, I love it! Fantastic! - Really, you like it? - Gorgeous! - Is it what you're looking for? - Totally. So you're rich? No, when my mom bought it it was cheap. It has gone up though. Sorry, I don't know what your budget is. My budget? I'll be very frank. I have no limits, I follow my heart. I can do 3 or 4 million max, no more. Gotta say... I love it. Check out the view! What's your job? I don't have one. Why are you selling? I have to, I went... - I went bankrupt. I'm in debt. - Congratulations. I sensed you were a rebel! You know, debt is financial fiction fueled by neo-capitalism. This is pretty, I love it. - Are you rich? - In my own way, sure. Right, OK. Thanks for coming by. We're done, right? No, wait. Let me visualize a bit. Nice office. I might do something else with it... I love it. I have no mortgage, I can buy quick. That's the... real estate agent. Perfect. Wait, let me... Bom dia! Hello. Ah, Mrs. Mayer? - Yes, I'm Mrs. Mayer. You're Olivia... - Olivia Byrne. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you, too. You look... very French. - And I am Mr. Mayer. - Hello. - No. - Yes. Shall we... this is the living room. You know, you have a very interesting job. - I do indeed. - Yes, you're like a parasite. - A very useful parasite. - Don't listen to him, he's... drunk. No, he's absolutely right. It's what I always say to my assistant. Nobody needs us, but... nobody can get by without us. What'd she say? It's a very good wall, it's not placo (plaster). Lovely, what is this, early 70's? - Yes, early 70's. - Early 70's. Okay, I'm going to have to leave you with my beautiful wife because I have to go to... the office. - For my job. - Ah, useful job. - Goodbye my love. - Doodbye. You look beautiful today. Thank you. I'll see you tonight. Take care of my beautiful wife, please. Bye-bye. - Bye. - Bye. You have a very charming husband. Yes, indeed. So, we're going through here, to the vestibule. - Good size bedroom. - Yes, this way we're going. - And it looks on to the balcony as well. - Oh, yeah. Love it, love it. Ah, here we are! Oh my god, look at that! You can see all of Lisbon! Well, actually half of it but yeah... Be nice with the chatty lady. She's here to help you. Are you going to be leaving any of this furniture? Yeah, I will leave everything you want. "Yes, I will leave everything you want." Could you be any less friendly? Charming little alcove, what's this? Sliding doors! - Well, that's wonderful! - Yeah. A friend of my mother did it. - Very artistic. So lifelike! - Yeah, indeed. Ah, master bedroom. Yes. You don't mind do you? Open these up. Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't seen these things since the 60's. Ah that's better. Let's get some air... great light! Yes. - Is it your flat? - No it's my mother's flat. Fabulous taste. Is she moving to a facility? Yeah, I guess you can call death a facility. You are funny! - Sorry about your loss, love. - It's okay. You are funny. This isn't a load bearing wall, is it? - What do we have here? - This is wood. I know that, I'm trying to get a sound here. I don't feel well at all. Are you alright, love? Should I breathe into a paper bag? Drink water? Eat sugar? Mom stole sugar packets. Couldn't help herself. "It's allowed. I paid for them." She pocketed them. Her coat pockets were full of sugar. Better? You don't mind, do you? This area has changed so much. Your mother made a great investment, you know that? Quite funny, because people have this recurring image of the Portuguese... Don't you? I'm sorry, I was not listening, I'm sorry. You know this lady over here? She's the last one in the building. Everyone wants to boot her out. I've been to her flat actually. We get along. Coo-ee. Such a character. Authentic Lisbon. Won't budge. You know of my colleagues... They would do anything to get people out of certain flats. I mean anything. I'm talking sabotage. Rats, cutting elevator cables... electricity, anything. Dark stuff. I would never do that. Fantastic, I'll be in touch. - You take care. - Okay, bye. I would say no, ghosts do not exist. When we see, as in your case, a person who has crossed over, passed away, or is dead, like your mother for example, I'd qualify it as a hallucination. It could be a warning sign for schizophrenia, brain degeneration, impending blindness. Nothing serious. Schizophrenia? Yikes. That's serious! - Be quiet. - She's just tired. Silence! HALLUCINATIONS CANCER SIGNS OF IMMINENT DEATH... SIGNS OF TERMINAL CANCER. WHERE DO WE GO AFTER DEATH? And now, the quiz! Did Claudia Mayer say this to her kids? Ready? First sentence. "Spots are on clothes, not foreheads." True! In '92, to Simon, after judo! - Good answer. - Yay! "I never had to dress like a whore to attract men." In '96! To Jeanne as she dressed for a party! Good answer. DIVE OF THE YEAR! Next category: Guilt. "You never, ever call me." True! To Jeanne and Simon, every day since they left! Another good answer. VERY BIG DOG BEING VERY NICE WITH BABY New category: Cynical Depression. "When I'm bored, I shop for tombstones. Ha, ha, ha." To Jeanne, on her birthday! Good answer. When were the following words said by Claudia to her children: "I love you." - When Jeanne graduated with honors! - Wrong answer. - When Jeanne had meningitis! - Wrong. Right before killing herself! Time's up. The correct answer is: Never. Hey! - Hi, how are you? - And you? Sure you're OK? Yeah, I'm fine. - So, did you find a buyer? - No. Is it hard, clearing out? Kind of. I can't seem to organize. Shit. Well, if you need cigarettes, I hid some behind my armoire. OK. And a bag of weed, if you're lucky. - Ah, no way. - No? OK. I saw Mom. You did? Me too, funny. How is she? I saw her. I swear I did. What? So you found the weed! I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm not with you. My little Jeanne. The dog sends his love. The dog doesn't care. Not true. - Thanks for the laughs. - Kisses. Wakey-wakey! Good morning, Jeannette. Sleep well? Where are we again? We're in Lisbon. Remember the Portuguese hymn? Clear up today. You can do it. It's easy. Place objects in bags and boxes. Throw them out. The city will haul them off. Then they'll go to giant landfills. And spill out into oceans and rivers. Today, you tackle the kitchen! But it's too nice out to clean. You'll clean at night. Vitamin D is good. You're too hot to stay in today! Way. Too. Hot. Thank you sir, but I already have a date. That good, faithful dog! A little bump and grind will do us good. We can trust him. Quality service. Money back guarantee. Quality, hee hee! What the hell? What the fuck! To think I took a shower for this! This guy is of no use. What to do? Find an excuse! Quick, or we'll have to talk about the baby. He'll tell me she's 14 months old. Not a year and two months. Why the hell do people still have babies! Right. Let's take an interest. Is she nice? She's a baby, like all babies. Once she can talk like a human I'll let you know, but for now... Wait. Touch her head. - No. - Feel how squishy it is. - Squishy. - So cool. Who's her mom? A teacher named Margarida. How old is she? 27. You think I'm an idiot. You always have. - She could be your baby. - No thanks. Don't listen. Jeanne... are you OK? I'm fine. Are you, Vitor? I know you have a heart of stone, but... it must've been hard. - Why didn't you call me? - We'd broken up. Can't I be your friend though? Don't cry, Jeannette! Don't cry, Jeannette! We'll marry you off! BACK TO SQUARE SEXY ECCENTRIC GREEN QUEEN A REVOLUTIONARY ANTI-PLASTIC MACHINE Right, well, it means nothing. She kept everything. It means nothing, Jeanne! She kept cake boxes, egg boxes, shoe boxes. "They're practical. Don't throw it out! "Perfect for storing soaps. "Put photos in it. Jewelry. "Make candles in them. "I love boxes." Mom... I am not OK. I'm going to need help. We need to talk, Jeanne. I need to explain. You never imagined your mother would choose to die. You were too afraid she'd die in an accident. When you were little, you feared she'd die in a plane or a train or crossing the street. When she went to bed, you feared she'd stop breathing and die. You were so obsessed with the idea that you often imagined the day of her funeral. What you'd wear, what you'd say. You're pretty lazy. Maybe do the closet today? It's small, won't take long. Or Simon's room? No, Jeanne. No, no! What did I just say? You have to clear up. No! Jean? It's Jeanne. It's simple. Compare two jars, like a discerning consumer. Read the label, then decide you don't want it. As you put it back, the other one falls into your bag. Your turn. I take two jars, I compare them... I put one back and slip the other one... OK, never mind. Get in the caddy. We'll try something lighter. Good job, bravo! You'll find all the answers with Klepto Man here. I don't get it, Jeanne. What's your plan? Ever going back to France? Gonna stay and settle down with Jean, Vitor and the kids? You worry me! Theodora, the origin of "travail", meaning work. Trepalium, which means torture in Latin. Instrument of torture, yes. What are the only two things that are truly essential to life on Earth? A knife and drinking water. Good. What do you say if your Mom tries to send you to business school? Participating in the speculative depletion of the planet won't make me happy. I want a job that allows me to be a free woman. Very good. My dad never taught me that. He's my uncle. She's my sister's daughter. I help her out. The dad lives abroad. And Mom's on business in Dijon. No smoking here. What? - He says no smoking. - I know, sir. It's just a vape. Sir look, it's electronic. It doesn't burn. - What'd he say? - We have to leave. Leave? Do it only in supermarkets. They feast on the backs of small producers. Very important. Here, a snack. Snack. Thanks. - Wearing makeup? - No. - You are. - No. You did your eyes. Maybe a little. Gives you a tragic air. Bit smudged. Beautiful. Thanks. Suits you. Green light, let's go. So you always wear black? No, not especially. Do you know black is the color of hope for the Mayans? Are you OK? It'll be long. What're you doing? - Where are you going? - Be right back. - Such a nice guy! - What? It's free. How so, why? What'd you say? - By the way, you're blind. - What? You're blind. Thank you. Thanks. - Will we see the sharks? - Yes. Look, there's one! Jeanne? You OK? Can you sit up? Easy now... Happened to me too during my depression. I'm not in a depression! OK. No, I think I... didn't eat enough breakfast. It's a hypoglycemic episode. I wanted to see the penguins. Next time. I'm going home, I don't feel well. Makes sense. I understand. What's to understand? I'm just going home. OK. Wanna come to the beach this weekend? Or be alone with your depression? I'd love to come with you guys. See? - Which beach? - I'll call you. - OK. See you later. - This weekend. Yeah, yeah. Depression? What's he on about? Does he think he's a doctor? Depressed people do not work for institutes that save the oceans! That save the world! I don't think so, sir! I have enough problems as it is. I'm not depressed. Depression is serious. You have to take pills and stuff. - Hello? - Hi, Jeannette. - You OK? - Great. - Busy this weekend? - I don't know. I might go to the beach. Come if you like. - Let me know where. - OK, bye. Great, the beach! We're gonna have to wax. All is well. I need to say it four stimes so it'll work. All is well, all is well, all is well, all is well. All is well... A heart attack is coming! The end of the world is nigh! It's tough to find new work! And why bother? We're all gonna die! I just learned I have hypoglycemia. A bad case. I must be vitamin deficient. I sleep way too much. I can't get over Mom's death. I see her ghost. I can't be depressed on top of it! Tomorrow I'll get up early. I'll be done in two days. Sell the place and leave! Well well, Mother... "Calista had been awaiting this for weeks. "Under the soft warm hand grazing her flannel pants, "she felt her secret flower throbbing. "At last, Steve's lips touched hers. "Finally, she could surrender to passion." Ms. Mayer, foreign investors don't scare easily. I sold a property where the whole family died asphyxiated by poison. Carbon monoxide. It's now a beautiful loft. Two women live there. A couple. They're very happy. OK. I love art. Great kitchen. Don't look in the cupboards. Good though. - I have to go. - They open. I have to go. Don't open the cupboards! OK. I love this! Can I confess something, Ms. Mayer? I have one regret in life. I couldn't convince that little lady to sell her flat. See that little lady down there? I tried everything. Everything. - I'll give you my estimate tomorrow. - Perfect. Goodbye, sir. Yes. The apartment is pretty nice. I was with the owner's daughter. Yeah, she's not bad. I'm not sure. She must be about 50. Jean? When was your depression? When he went to the hospital! Mental hospital? Yes, 3 months. Everyone should do it. Made me the man I am today. He said it was Club Med! Because you were ashamed? No, just a dumb joke. Club Meds, you know? You get tons of pills. A real party. How awful. It scares you? I'm scared of insanity, like everybody. People get the wrong idea. It's not all fetal positions, voices, hallucinations. It can be, but... Must've been bad if you were committed. I had a psychotic episode. Heard of that? - No. - So fun. - No. - At first it's not very interesting. You can't sleep. You think all your ideas are brilliant. Then it's more... "I am Jean. "I am the Alpha and the Omega. "I am the Beginning and the End. "I am the First and the Last. Be gone with you! "All you dogs, "whoremongers, murderers, idolaters. "All who love, and speak, lies! "I am St. Jean of the Apocalypse!" Terrifying. Then I'd go out with wine or beer and bless people to save them. Did you realize you were crazy? No, I wasn't crazy. I was St. Jean. How awful. "He who is thirsty, come to me and drink! "The water of life!" I blessed a cop with wine. He arrested me and I was committed. Your sister trusts you with Théo? Sure. I control it now. It's all under control. You're prone to it too, huh? No, not at all. Jeanne Mayer's a bit nuts. No. A bit cuckoo? I like it. No, but I'm not. Shall we go? Sure, if you like. Anxiety is harder in beautiful settings. But I'm not anxious. Just trying to help. I don't need help. - Hello. - Hello, Vitor! My choir teacher! I thought you weren't coming. Best time. Nobody here. We can swim naked. Coming? No, I've had my fill. Come for dinner. - Yes, yes! - No, no. - Why? - Gotta go home. Why? Dad said no. He's not my dad, he's my uncle. How about you? Sure, I'll come. OK, let's go. Are you sure? - What? - Are you sure? Yeah, yeah. OK. We'll hit the playa again. Get on. - You never said he was your teacher. - I didn't know you knew him. Right. We'll hit the playa... Hit the playa? Why'd I say that? That's so lame. Thanks. What the fuck am I doing here? Nice place. I like this house. Feels like vacation all year round. Give me a break. He has a wife and baby. Get a grip, Jeanne! - Can I get myself a glass of water? - No, no... Are we sleeping with him? He should wash his hands. They were on the scooter handles. Gross. I wish he'd wash them. There's no food. I'll be going anyway. OK. I changed the ending. Before it was... Now it's... Ah, right. I always liked that song. Jeanne is about to leave... Make it stop. I watch her put her clothes back on... And all I have left are my crying eyes Can you take me home? Wouldn't you rather sleep over? No. I don't feel like taking the scooter. It's cold. Oh god, you bum me out. So bad. You cheat on your wife, you... I'm not cheating. - Sure. - I'm not! She sleeps with whoever she wants and so do I. Give me money. What? Money for a taxi. I want to go home, I'm tired. Thanks. Don't worry. You're fabulous anyway. I'm sure you'll break up many a marriage. See you around. Bye. It was good, right? The sex. Isn't the bridge beautiful? Especially at night. You can see all the city lights. I grew up here but I never tire of it. Open the door. Police! Open up! - Hey! - You scared me! - Hi Jeanne. - Hi. - I'm gonna play, Dad. - OK. Hi. Come, Zuzu! Why didn't you call? To surprise you! What are you wearing? I was sleeping. Fuck. Wow. We're at Mom's. Yep. You look like a tragedienne. Show me to my quarters, please. - Hungry? - Yeah. I've got eggs. I like eggs. - And beer. - Sounds good. You've only done 5 boxes in 10 days? Sorting takes time. Don't sort! Toss those magazines out. We'll never finish otherwise, look! We can't throw out National Geographic. Sure we can. Will you read them again? "I'm not pleased, Jeanne! I'll send you to boarding school! "I'm furious, Jeanne, furious." Fucking tape. There. Did you get an offer at least? - No. - Not yet? Good thing I'm here. Your brother is here. All is well. A little coffee break... then we do the boxes. You'll show me how you do it. OK, Jeanne? I'll help you. What do we do with the dishes? Help us, Sacha. Which do you want? - These? - Those are fine, yeah. That's a good method. Exactly. You got the right idea. This one goes here. This one, here. This one goes... look. Right here. Nice one. This one, here! That's the idea. Here. The special... wedding dishes We don't need this one anymore. The fragile porcelain goes right here. - Want these for Paris? - Yeah, I... Hey! Hi. - Oh, sorry. - Hi. Come in. My brother, Simon. - Ah, OK. - Jean. Don't let me interrupt. You're not interrupting. You didn't call. And since I'm... too proud to call first, I just showed up. You did right. Wanna help us sort? - We're in the thick of it. - I'd love to. I'm a robot. Nobody can destroy me. Simon wanted to be a ballerina when he was little. He wanted a tutu for Xmas. Not funny. Remember that video of the Japanese ballerinas? They were so serious, and yet... so extravagant, so strange. - So strange. - Show me. - What? - Their moves. No, I can't... - I can't. They were young! - So? Well, I don't know... They stepped forward, then twisted their back foot like this. - Then what? - They lifted their arms. Like... Yeah. - Yeah, like that. - You go. Yeah, exactly like that. - OK, go on. - You two look like swans. Right foot. - That's more conventional. - No good? It's pretty, but they were doing something more... Don't worry, I've got this We can never lose When we're in love I've got your books, your little dog They're happy Here are the keys to your happiness Come and get it! Call me if by chance they don't fit You know where to find me I won't budge 'Cause I love you And don't forget Nicolas' communion... Your hands are so tiny. I was going to take you to Italy On a lovers' journey Too bad for you I love you too Oh no, shit! Shame. - Hello? - Good evening, Ms. Mayer? - Jeanne Mayer? - Put the music back on! This is she. Who's this? - Yeah, who? - It's Léopold. I was an intern at Nausicaa. Do you remember me? Sure I remember you, Léopold. - Something wrong? - No. I'm calling because... I've been watching the live feed. Even after... what happened. I was so sad, you know. Put it out of your mind, Léopold. It's over now. Right, but no. I'm still watching... Get to the point, Léopold! You should check it out. Since yesterday, amazing things are happening. Has this been seen before, or is it new? It's like the first man on the moon. Crazy. How deep is that? Between 1,000 and 2,000 meters below sea level. In the mesopelagic zone. It's great. Maybe it'll reboot your career. Nah. That thing can't filter plastic. It's beautiful. Come, Jean. You need to finish this, it's important. Finishing is important, because then you can move on. Let's empty this out. Jean, help me. You look like Mom, in mascara. "Gott, I'm tired! Zo tired! "After all I've done for you two. You're zo ungrateful!" "I'll end up at the psycholo-schist." "Ya, ya." She never put lipstick on right. Nope! When my mom died, I kept her hairbrush for two years. I couldn't throw it away. Why are we going home? Hello Jean. Hey! How old are you? WANNA GRAB A CUP OF JOE? Joe? You sure about that? Wanna grab a cup of joe? PLS? MESSAGE FROM JEAN AIRPORT HEY!
