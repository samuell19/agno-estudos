- Who is it? - It's me, Hans! Oh, it's you. Mother! Just like you to show up in the middle of the night. I've been away for more than a year, Mother. Joining the Legion, well, that's your own business. But dragging along with you a nice young man like Manfred Wagner... His parents gave me such a hard time. They held me responsible, me! - Is he back, too? - Manni is dead. It's always the same. The best are left behind while people like you come home. I've changed, Mother. A devil in the morning, a devil in the afternoon. Fresh pears! THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS 2.40 a kilo! A real bargain! Fresh pears! Fresh pears! 2.40 a kilo! Buy them here! Fresh pears! 2.40! Buy them here! Fresh pears! Hey! What? Fresh pears! Fresh pears! Buy them here! A real bargain! Fresh pears! The best quality! Hello? Bring me up two pounds, please. Nice big ones. You're not going. I have to go. Two pounds of pears, please. Come in. No, she... Maybe some other time. As you wish. I'll leave the pears here. Thanks. Honestly, I didn't even shake hands with her. You were gone for seven minutes. In seven minutes, you can do more than shake hands. Fresh pears! Fresh pears! Very cheap! Fresh pears! Only 2.40! - A real bargain! - Of course you're dishonest. - It's a bit more, okay? - Sure. Having trouble? You know how men are. 2.80. I'm sure you know. Give me a double. - Having a tough time? - lt's always the same. I know what you mean. Thanks. I'll go pick up Renate from the nursery. Okay. I'll take the pears to the cellar. Dinner will be ready at 7:00. Go ahead! Nothing! Nothing can be taken back once it's happened. Nothing. It was my own fault. How could I get mixed up with someone like her? I'm an idiot. But I was a good police officer. Honestly. Not one problem, not one. Not until that little tramp. She had the hots for you, right? The hots? Oh, man. I picked her up in Viktualienmarkt. Prohibited area, I thought. Pretty obvious what she was doing there. I said, “Come with me, kid. We'll have a little talk down at the station.” And she came along willingly. That's it. I wanted to take down her personal info. Only her personal info. - Name? - Marile. Marile Kosemund. Date of birth? May 31, 1932. In Munich. Officer EDP! Excuse me, I... No need to explain, Officer. I'm not blind. And, believe me, there will be consequences for you. Yes? No. Look, I'm so worried. He really isn't with you? Of course. Excuse me. Thanks. Swan Inn? This is Mrs. Epp. I'd like to know if my husband is there. Yes, Hans. Yes? Thanks. Thanks. Of course it was fair. What else could they do? What else? It's absolutely obvious... ...that such behavior can't be tolerated in the department. I'm not complaining. If I didn't know that myself... ...I'd have been a lousy police officer, right? But I was a good police officer. A good police officer. What are you doing here? Come home, please. Please come home. I'll come home when I feel like it. ls that clear? Hans! Please! I said I'll come home when I feel like it! Or are you deaf? I'll come home when I feel like it... and not one second sooner, get it? Not one second. Now get out of here or you'll get it! Please, Hans. Please. You'll pay for that chair, you know. I'll pay for the chair. Of course I'll pay for the chair. I pay for everything. Everything- Another round! Come on! What else do I work for? What else? Am I right? - Sure. How much, sweetheart? Stop crying- Put the child to bed and go to sleep. God, what a filthy pig you are. Get out of here, Renate. - Come here! - Don't touch me! You hit me! - Let go of me! - Do what I say! You're my wife! Is that clear? Stop it, please! Don't you dare call me a pig! Not you! You think I work so hard so you can call me a pig? I'll call the police! The police? You want to call the police? Go ahead and call the police! Call them! You bitch! I want to sleep. Be quiet. I just want to sleep. Irmgard? Irmgard? Irmgard! Irmgard! Irmgard! Irmgard! Irmgard! Can I help you, Mr. Epp? Did you hear them last night? - You kidding? I couldn't sleep. - I wouldn't stand for it. Did you hear them, too? I'm leaving you for good. Irmgard. I want to study to be a mechanic, Mother. No, Hans. You'll stay in school. I don't want you in a profession where you'll get your hands dirty. Absolutely not. And that's final. I hate you! I hate you, Mother! And then he hit me. You can't imagine how he hit me. With his fists! He hit me with his fists! Renate! Renate! Tell them. Tell them how he hit me. Tell them. Mommy, Mommy! I'll never go back to him. Never again. It's so humiliating. Of course you won't. There's a certain line one mustn't cross. No matter what can be said in his favor. And we've always taken that into account. Have you? So what exactly do you take into account? Please, Anna. I just want to know what you take into account. You all despise him. Just face it. That's not true. You're a liar. You know you're a liar. Forgive me, Irmgard, but you must admit they despise him. They're ashamed of him. Oh, no. No, Anna. Certainly not. They always let us store our fruit in the cellar here. They've always been good to him. Always good. My son beats his wife nearly to death. But he's never listened to me. Never. But it's just the other way around, Mother. You've never concerned yourself with what was right for him. That's how it's always been. How could you say that? I've always loved my boy. Don't get upset, Mother. There's no reason to reproach yourself, believe me. We need to consider what to do now, ... ...where you'll stay and so on. - You know staying here is not easy. - Renate, come to me. Of course. But for two or three days, until you'll find something... Thank you. Thanks. Don't cry. Don't you cry. Everything will be fine. But I need her so much. Everything's gone to hell. Of course you're right, ... ...but if he really beats her... What should we do, Kurt? Please. The poor thing won't stop crying. - Hans is coming. - No! No, my God! He'll beat me to death! He's so violent. He'll beat me to death. Is she here? Let me in. You won't hurt her, will you? They're all against you anyway. I only want her to come back. That's all. - Come, Irmgard. - No. No, stay away from me! I won't hurt you, Irmgard! Hans! - Damn it, you're coming with me! - No! Quiet, he won't hurt you! Oh, God! - He's going to kill me! - No, he's not. Calm yourself, Hans! This can't go on! She has to come home with me! Well, then. I'll call my lawyer now. Dr. Schirach's office? May I speak with my attorney, please? Irmgard! Sir? Mrs. Epp here, Irmgard Epp. I want to file for divorce. Of course. You cannot have everything you want Hans! - Hans, my boy! - Do something! Hello? Mrs. Epp? What's going on? Hello? Hans. Hans. Don't do this to me. Hans. Hello? Emergency response? Please send an ambulance to Tizianstrasse 33. I've never... I've never done anything like this before. That's what they all say. - Don't be mean. - Everyone wants to have their fun. Where do we go? No idea. Your place? Unfortunately, no. My wife is at home. So you're married? Yes. Aren't you? I am. Yes, I'm married, too. Ah, you're so good. You're so good. - How is he? - He's not allowed to talk yet. I brought him some grapes. Can he have them? No. He likes them so much. Maybe another patient would like them. Someone who nobody visits. There are plenty of those, you know. Thank you. The little one should stay outside. Children often get too restless. You wait here, all right? Will my daddy die? You know, everyone dies sooner or later. I brought you grapes. But the nurse said you're not allowed to eat them. I asked her to give them to another patient. You know, someone without relatives. Hans. Mrs. Epp, it's time. I'll just be a moment. I'll come again tomorrow. Get well soon. I'll stay with you. He looks terrible. He's very ill, Mrs. Epp. Come... Yes. - Where is Renate? - She was here just a minute ago. Renate? Don't cry. Your father will be healthy again... ...if he wants to. He has the constitution of a horse. But what if he dies? I just said he's going to live... ...if he wants to. This is 133-748. Yes, she's here. The nurse must have said something stupid. What? I see. How is he? See you soon. Your mother was worried. You lied to me. I'm sorry. Well, then. I don't understand what you said. - What? - That... That my father is going to live if he wants to. You know, people haven't always been good to your father. Who? - Never mind. - Tell me, Aunt Anna. No, Renate. Maybe one day. Maybe I'll tell you one day. Aren't you coming up? I'm not coming back anymore. I signed up for the Foreign Legion. I can't stand it here anymore. Mother, school. You know I... But you can't just... You're going to war, Hans. People die. Anything is better than this. Honestly. They gave me some money. Here. Buy something for yourself. Hans! Certainly, Mrs. Epp. Your husband will make a full recovery, but... Tell me, Doctor. Please. Look, a heart attack like this weakens the entire system. And in a weakened state, you must not overexert yourself. That is to say... ...that your husband must not do any heavy work. He must not lift any heavy weights, do you understand? You must see to that. And one more thing. The consumption of alcohol... ...would be fatal, absolutely fatal. You must see to that as well. I have to go now. I've explained all of this to your husband. You may see him now. Good-bye. No more heavy work. No more lifting. Good afternoon, Mrs. Epp. - Are you unwell? - No, thanks. - Can I help you? - I'm fine. Did the doctor tell you? It's bad, isn't it? We'll make it somehow. You're just saying that. You don't mean it. I do mean it, Hans. I do. We can do it. I know we can. If I'd learned a trade, a real trade. But like this... Be still. It's no use talking like that. Look, I'll find a vendor's stand. You'll just buy the fruit, ... ...and I'll sell it from the stand. And the vending cart permit? What'll happen to that? The sales are much higher from the vending cart. And they aren't issuing new permits. Who knows if we can make a living from what you'll earn. Oh, no. It's pretty hopeless, believe me. What if... ...we hire someone? - An employee? - Sure! He'll sell in the back courtyards for a fixed salary plus a percentage, ... ...and the rest will be ours. Fantastic. Exactly! Why didn't I think of it earlier? We'll earn much more than before, much more! We'll only have to buy a second cart, that's all. But that's easy. Everything will be fine. I'm so happy, Hans. So happy. - 400? - No, no. 600. Listen, you'll make that in one week with this cart. No. You'll have to pay 600. - I'll pay 450, not a penny more. - No, no. Wait! Come here. I bought it 20 years ago, for my girlfriend. So she could stand on her own two feet. Now she's dead. Edema. Cherish it. Treat it well. - 80,500. - All right. Yes, Röntgenstrasse 9. Epp residence. See you. Yes, the work can get a little dirty. Have you done dirty work before? Yes, where I've been, everything was dirty. Cairo, Beirut. In those countries, things are not as clean. I mean, I'm used to it. So it's not a problem for me. Which countries were you in? Well, in the end I was in Egypt and... Then I left, when the whole mess started down there. And I've been almost everywhere in the middle east, in Persia, ... ...Pakistan... I did truck transport there. Everywhere over there. But now you plan to stay in Munich for good? - Pardon? - You plan to stay in Munich? No, not really. I'd like to go away again. But now you're looking for work in Munich. You know, I don't like it here. Not for good. You understand? No, I don't understand. Well, I've just been roaming around these last years. But you're looking for work. Yes, but only short term. Really short term. Tell me, what do you think... ...you should earn? Well, I want 900. That's quite a lot, 900. Well, I've got an apartment, new furniture... ...a washing machine... ...and I'm saving up for a car... ...and I've got a girlfriend. She costs me money. Yeah, costs me money. And the washing machine, like I said. I can't do it for less than 900. - I do need... - One moment, please. Yes? Yes, that's right. Yes, please come over. Röntgenstrasse 9. Epp residence. Yes, 9. Good-bye. Could you pay a deposit? Well... - ...a deposit? - Yes, a deposit. Well, my mother doesn't have anything. Maybe my grandparents, ... ...but I'd have to ask. - How much would it be? - 5,000. No, that's impossible. - So, no deposit? - No, no way. But you'd have to handle money that doesn't belong to you. I somehow need to trust you. That's unbelievable. You're saying you can't trust me? I didn't say that. Well... Have you actually ever worked a job? Yeah, I guess. But I can leave, if you like. Hans? I got the cart, imagine! For 500. First he wanted 600. That's my wife. But I wouldn't let... This is Anzell. Mr. Anzell is going to work for us. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Well, I'd better be going now. - Good-bye, Mr. Epp. - Good-bye. Mrs. Epp? - Good-bye. - Good-bye. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Good-bye. Do you think he's reliable? Who? That Anzell. To me, he looks like a criminal. Yeah? I don't know. I like him. Your longing Cannot be stilled Even when your dreams Are fulfilled Remember? Yes. You were so funny. Oh, mama mia I remember your song Buona buona notte Bambino mio You cannot have everything you want Don't be sad. I knew right away you were the one I wanted. Even though you're much shorter than me. And then you started to sing along with that song. You were so funny. I knew right away you were the one I wanted. Away from my homeland Wanderlust drove me And out there I found homesickness The desire Never left me Oh, mama mia Today I understand you Buona buona notte Bambino mio You cannot have everything you want Buona buona notte It's really quite simple. Your voice should sound like that of an old friend. Try it. Plums, quality plums! 1.20 a kilo! The best quality! Buy them here! Quality plums! A real bargain! Go on! Fresh plums! 1.20 a kilo! Fresh plums! 1.20 a kilo! Not bad at all. But still not quite warmhearted enough. That's pretty tough. Warmhearted? - That's how it is. - Okay. Plums, quality plums! Buy them here! lt's a bargain! 1.20 a kilo! Plums! The best quality! Buy your plums here! 1.20 a kilo! Hello. - Need anything? - Two crates of plums. Is that your husband? Yes. Your husband seems very friendly. I find him very sweet, too. 1.30, please. Thank you. Good-bye. And good luck with the new stand. Thanks. - So, how's he doing? - Not bad at all. - Where are you going? - We'll see. Plums, quality plums. 1.20 a kilo. - Buy them here... - Four kilos, please. - Are you new around here? - Yes. I work for Mr. Epp. He used to do this. Ah, yes, the short man with the tall wife. It's horrible when such a short man ends up with such a tall woman. It must give him a complex, don't you think? I don't know. They seem to get along pretty well. - 1.30, please. - Thanks. - Good-bye. - See you tomorrow. Plums, fresh plums! 1.20 a kilo! Fresh plums! Buy them here! lt's a bargain! 1.20 a kilo! Fresh plums! - Two kilos of plums, please. - Sure. How... How much is it? 2.40. 1.20 a kilo. Here. - There. - Thanks. Very good. Great sales. 1,720.70 Deutschmarks. 1,720.70 per week is good, very good. Thanks. Yes, the bill is all right. Okay. Here are 200 marks for you. Plus a share of five percent... ...that makes 86 marks. Here. Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. Good-bye then. I must go now, my wife is waiting. See you Monday. - Bye. - Bye. Well? He didn't cheat us, if that's what you mean. How can you be sure? I watched him at work. - You did? - Yes! You watched him? You really did? And I'll do so at random in the future! And now you'll keep on watching him? That's absolutely hilarious! What a riot! Daddy, I don't understand my homework. Read it to me. Farmer Obermayer bought a cart of hay. His cart has a capacity of 40 hundredweights. How long will the supply last... ...if each cow eats a quarter hundredweight per day... ...and the farmer owns 62 cows? I'll go in. Zucker always has good tomatoes. Well? Wait a moment. I have an idea. Okay, go ahead. You can sell the fruit any way you like, can't you? Sure, more or less. Why don't you charge a little more than you put on the bill? You mean... Exactly. You'll share the surplus with me. I have a few things I'd like to treat myself to. I want to sleep with you. I... I'm really keen on you. Afterwards. I promise. Careful. Zucker says if I take 50 crates, I can have them for 2.50 each. Otherwise, they're 3.50. Shall I do it? Definitely. - Can we sell them in a week? - I can sell 40 a week. - The rest she'll sell at the stand. - Come with me. Buy them here. Top quality! 80 cents, a bargain! Tomatoes! Buy your tomatoes! 80 cents, a bargain! The lowest prices! You sold them for 60 cents a kilo, right? Yes, just like you told me. 60 cents a kilo. Isn't that right? Yes. That's right. But what would you say if I told you... ...that you sold them for 80 cents a kilo... ...and not 60. There. That's everything. Give me 200 marks. I've earned it anyway. - Whore! She told me to! - Hans! Help me! She told me to sell them for more! That's a lie! When you were in the hospital, I did it with her! You don't believe him, do you? - Out of here! - All right, I'll leave! That's one fine wife you've got! Hans? You don't believe him, do you? Of course not. Really, Hans, I love you. I do love you, but... But? I can't bring you home, with your profession. My father... I can't tell him I want to marry someone... ...who's a fruit merchant walking around with a cart. I thought, where there's love... It's best we don't see each other anymore. Please. Please be sensible. I love you so much. Do you know someone reliable for the back courtyards? That's difficult. Hardly anyone is reliable these days. If you have to watch them all the time, might as well do it yourself. - Am I right? - Yes. - Hello, Zucker. - Hello, Harry. - Hans! - Harry! Wow. You must come and meet my wife. I was in Egypt for seven years. Married... ...set up a little shop, ... ...but it all went wrong. The marriage, the business, everything. How did you get out? Out of the Legion? I just left. Two months after you did. Man, those were some times. - Who is it? - Hans! May I introduce you to my friend Harry? My wife. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - You're Harry from the Legion? - Yes. - Hans has told me a lot about you. - Only good things, I hope. Only good things. He's going to work for me now. I'm really pleased to hear that. Many thanks. This month, we've earned almost 2,000 marks. Harry is all right. I didn't say anything. But does he really have to live with us? I don't know. Harry is my friend. And besides, he's not here that much. I'm sorry. And another thing, he hasn't cheated us in six weeks. Not once. I don't have anything against him, Hans. But the apartment, you know. We're a family, after all. A family needs a place... ...which they can have to themselves. Don't you think? Harry can stay as long as he likes. And that's final. What's the matter with your husband? He's just become a little quieter. Suits him well, don't you think? I noticed him acting strange a couple of times, like he was ill. No really, he's fine. He's just quiet. 1.90. Good afternoon, Mr. Epp! Good afternoon. - See you tomorrow. - Good-bye. There, I'm done. Hans! Harry wants to settle up. You do it. I don't feel like it. If you say so. All right. Monday through Wednesday, tomatoes: 612.30 marks. Four crates were rotten. - Thursday and Friday... - Daddy, I can't do my homework. Can you help me, please? Wait a moment. I'll finish the bill, then I'll help you. We must hurry, my husband's coming soon. How was I to know you'd come today, after months? Eight. - What? - Eight months. Yes. What's the matter? Is something wrong? I don't know. Take off your clothes and come lie with me. Come on. Tell me. Is something the matter? No. But something is wrong. I don't know. I just don't feel like it. Come. Please. I... Can I do something for you? No. I'd like some coffee. You're too busy. No, there's some coffee ready. Are you having a tough time? No. No, not at all. Too much work? Well, you know, the others take care of that now. I take walks and think. Who knows. Maybe I think too much. You can never think too much, rather too little. Maybe so. But it torments me. - What? - Nothing. I should go now. I don't want to bother you. You're not bothering me. But the deadline for the manuscript is tomorrow. I'll come another time. - See you soon. - See you soon. “The Frog King. The princess cried, ... ...'The golden ball has fallen into the well.' The fat frog said, ... ...'Don't cry. I'll get your golden ball for you. In return, you will be my playmate.'” Yes. That's really very nice. What do you think, Hans? Me? Excuse me. I wasn't listening. Believe me. Your composition is very good. Here. Dinner is ready. Are you coming, Hans? Aren't you hungry? He's going to live if he wants to, you know. People haven't always been good to your father. Your longing Cannot be stilled Even when your dreams What's... I always knew my son was going to make it someday. Last month, we made 5,000 marks in sales. 5,000? That's pretty good. Kurt got a raise, too. You don't mind me saying so, do you, Kurt? Of course not. How much profit does that make for you, 5,000 in sales? A little more than 2,500. About 2,620. More importantly, ... ...he doesn't need to go... ...to those terrible back courtyards himself anymore, ... ...hawking his wares. To be honest, I was always a bit ashamed of him. When people asked me what my son did for a living, ... ...I used to blush. But now, I'm really contented with him. You've got a proper little enterprise, don't you? Of course, Grandmother! It's a proper enterprise. And in two years at the latest, ... ...we'll have our own shop. If all goes well. Everything's different now. Thank God. A really big shop, with delicacies and all. How wonderful. That's something else I have to look forward to. It's quite reassuring. Strictly speaking, it wasn't a proper livelihood before. I see. A few months ago, in this very spot, ... ...didn't you all deny that you despised him? You're being aggressive, that's all. You've always been nothing but aggressive. I'm not aggressive. I'm just honest. You despised him then. And basically, you despise him now. Let it be. They're right, in a way. It wasn't a proper livelihood. No security. - But on the police force... - Fine. Maybe they're right. But they don't have a right to despise you for it. Basically, you're much more despicable, Kurt. Much more despicable. Please, Anna. Please. Why? Why is Kurt despicable? You just talk and talk and evade all questions. As you wish. Isn't it despicable... ...if someone is responsible for a newspaper... ...whose views he doesn't share? Please, Anna. You're just assuming things. Then you do share its views? Tell us! Of course! Of course I share its views! Then you're stupid. More stupid than I thought. I can't stand this argument! I only want to say, Anna, that Kurt is a Christian. And his newspaper is a Christian newspaper. A Christian newspaper? You don't want to listen to your mother. Very well. But believe me, such behavior has its price. - I'll help you to bed, Mother. - Thank you, my child. Thank you. You're going to die, Hans. You'll die. So. That was one for each of you. And now one for my mother. For my sister Heide... ...and my brother-in-law, Kurt... ...for my sister Anna... ...and my daughter. And this one... ...is for my one true love. This one is for the police... ...this one is for my high school... ...and this one is for the Legion. Harry, you're the one true man. But you're also a pig. Of course. We're all pigs. That's true. But you're also just a pig. A tiny little pig. You only wanted what was best for me. Do you remember? Morocco? '47? Where's the camp? We must help him. Let's wait and see what happens. I don't know. If you tell me, I'll let you go. I promise. I'll let you go. I promise. I don't know. As you wish. I'll tell you! Leave me! Well? Near Massa. Thank you. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Please shoot. Help me. We couldn't come earlier. Why didn't you let me die? Why didn't you let me die? Hans? He's dead. Who's that woman? Which one? Over there. That's Hans's one true love. I called her. I'll go to my mother-in-law now. Why don't you come with me? Yes, I'll come with you. You know the business. Alone, I wouldn't know what to do. You get along well with Renate. You like her. I don't know how it is with me, whether you like me. But I like seeing you. If we get together, ... ...it'll be best for everyone, I think. For you, ... ...for me... ...and above all, for Renate. Okay.
