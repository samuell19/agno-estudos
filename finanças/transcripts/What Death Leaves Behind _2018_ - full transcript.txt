- What you doing with that? Nah, nah, right there. Catch. - All right, can I get this and then can I get a pack of Golds? All right. How much is that? 10 dollar. - All right. Thanks, man. - The body count is now at a total of four in the past month. The latest victim, a woman. Authorities have said they have been able to identify her through her body markings. However, they are not yet releasing her name. Her body is currently at the coroner's office and we are awaiting the autopsy results. So how were the local residents made aware of this? Obviously there were real concerns about safety after police confirmed they were treating this as a homicide, so how were they enlightened on this case, so to speak? Well some of them learned from watching the local news. The gates to the park are not closed, incidentally. It's remained open but it is under contamination order, meaning only people can use the wooded area and the grass areas. No fishing, no. - Hey, would you stop watching that show? We really need to go. Jake. Jake! What's up? - Hey, we need to go. It only takes me a minute. - All right, then take a minute. Jake, seriously we gotta go. - Are you even ready? - Yes, I'm ready, that's why I keep asking you to get ready. - All right, all I gotta do is put on my shirt. - Is your shirt on? Like all the way? - My god, it's a good thing you're cute. I swear to god. - The police commissioner, releasing a statement earlier today saying "If nothing else, "the discoveries of multiple bodies "found in the same area is troubling. "And we ask that all residents," Sunday afternoon, kayakers spotted what appeared to be a body wrapped in plastic in the Delaware river near Chester, Pennsylvania. After pulling the remains from the river, authorities confirmed it as Meagan Gallagher. Police maintain they cannot yet confirm this murder is connected to a string of recent deaths. Four other bodies that washed up along the banks, - Eight o'clock start time, basic union rules, you get an hour lunch. You're responsible for all your equipment so if you need anything repaired, just let us know, we'll take care of all that. Paperwork looks good, so, hey, I wanna introduce you to somebody, come on. - Yeah, yeah. - Yo Jake. What's up, man? - Hey I wanna introduce you. This is Andrew Blosser, new guy. - How's it going, man, I'm Jake. Andrew. - Jakes my nephew. Basically runs the family business and I basically take credit for it. - And basically takes a bigger check. - That's all right. You're gonna do the same thing to Alexis once she's old enough to work here. Jake just had a baby girl, Alexis. Cutest thing you wanna see. - Congrats. I have a little girl too. - Ah, what's her name? - Jessica. - Oh, nice. - Four years old. - Hey look, you wanna show Andrew the warehouse, give him a tour of the equipment? You should be familiar with everything already anyway, your resume said you did HVAC work, right? - I got you, I got you. - I actually gotta get running, I'm a little bit late but Uncle Henry here, he'll show you everything and when I get back, I'll show you how it's really done, all right? - Right, well after work, maybe we can take the new guy out for a drink. - Can't I got a date with some fresh paint, white walls and an impatient wife. You know Lisa. - I love you man. - Next time. - All right, hey. We can still have a drink. - So how did it go on that date? Oh, girl, what? Oh I know, I've seen those muscles. So yeah, I know. Okay, you let him put his hands there, seriously? But did you shush it away? I mean you don't want him to think you're easy. Oh we know better, but, you know. You gotta fake at them, right? Wait, what song? Oh, ooh. Oh that song. Okay, all right, I get it. I'm gonna blame the song. That's sexy. I know, oh man, seriously. Girl, you are nasty! You can't talk to me like that. I'm a married woman! Yeah. All right, you know what, I gotta finish dinner so I'm gonna call you back after everybody's asleep. All right. Bye. - Who was that? - Bianca. Anyway, have you taken your pills yet today? You normally call Bianca after everybody goes to bed? - Okay, do you want platanos or is that like too much potassium for you or whatever? - You're just gonna ignore what I asked you? - Yes, I'm gonna ignore the question you asked me. When were you gonna tell me the health insurance didn't cover another bill? - I'll take care of it, don't worry about that, all right? - Oh really? All right, so what's your plan, big man? How you gonna do it? - Don't worry about it. I said I'll take care of it, okay? Hi. - Hi. - How you doin? Thanks. Thank you. - Where'd you say you're from? - Oh I'm local. How about you? - I'm originally from Texas, but Maryland. - That's a nice area. - Yeah. Cool. Oh hey, look who it is. How's it going? - Going all right, how you doing? - Yeah you know, living the dream. You doing okay, Jake? - Yep, I'm good, how you doing? Who's the new guy? That's Greg, first week. - Welcome to hell, Greg. - Jake, that's so mean. - Happy to have you man, I'm Jake. - Hey Jake. - Any plans this weekend, or, - Maybe. Hey Fred. Fred! - Yeah? - Still down for poker tomorrow, man? - Oh Jake, I'm just so broke. Somebody robbed me tonight. Hell, they'd just be practicing. - Hey look, if you wanna wager your spot on the donor's list, you know. - That ain't gonna happen, slick. - Can work out a payment plan or something. - Yeah I've been number one around here for a long time, you just have to wait your turn, mister number two. - Yeah Jake, don't be getting all greedy on us. Some of us aren't even in the top 10 yet. - What number are you now? - Lucky number 13, as of Tuesday. - Okay, all right, moving on up. - You know it. - How long have you been on the list? - Me? Ooh, it's been a while. Maybe like four or five years. - Four or five years? Yeah. - I'm sorry, I don't understand. What, are we just waiting around to, for somebody to commit suicide? - Oh man, that ain't gonna happen. See what we need is for somebody to drive up to an ER and blow their brains out. Otherwise it's a waste. - Hey, have you guys seen that movie with Will Smith? You know the one where he kills himself in a tub of ice? That's how you do it. That's how you do it. - I'm sorry, what do you guys mean? - Would you like a moldy apple? - Oh, here we go. - I don't follow. - If someone dies at home or in their office or out in the field somewhere, their kidney's useless. Unless you want some medical student to be prodding and poking it around. Just a wasted organ. - Every time, every time. Yeah, basically with a kidney, got a couple hours. - And that is a moldy apple. - Way to keep it light, Fred. - Always. - Morning, Macy. Mike. - Hey Jake. - What's going on, man? - Hey man, how'd the morning go? You get any rest before you come in? - Yeah, yeah. - It might be a good idea for you to work from home on your dialysis days. I'm good. - Hey you're just like your old man. Well, since I have you here, some of the estimates on that property on high street, you know the old lady with all the cats, house smell like the part of the zoo you like to rush through? Anyway look, take your time, go over spreadsheets, correct them. You should have an email with the new numbers. I got it. - Sure you good? I'm good, Uncle. - The medical examiner just came through here and there's still some dive teams searching around the area for more evidence. A lot of state police are here. They even have a boat in the water. Now we don't have a lot of official communication here other than the fact that they have confirmed that yes, another body was found here this afternoon. Earlier, we were able to find two witnesses that were here when the body was brought ashore. She tells me I'm really cute and she grabs my butt. - Okay. - I'm bouncing on one leg, putting the AC unit in the air, she tells me again how cute my butt looks in my jeans. All right, I'm sticking to it. I go back up, put the unit in. I'm reaching up, you know how heavy these things are. I look back at her again. She's like 50 years old. She's like a Grilf, okay? A Milf is 40. 50 on up is a Grilf, okay, do you understand? So I'm sitting there and I feel this, like she's almost knocking me off balance. I turn around, it hits me it's my high school guidance counselor Big Titty Dorothy. Big Titty Dorothy. Everything else changed except for this. Now she has arthritis of the hands too. So I look back at her, I take a good look. I go back up, I pretend to back in. - That's small town shit, man. - Right. That's why I hate this small town shit, man. - I know, everybody knows everybody. - Right. - You know, 10 years in you find out you married your distant cousin. - With big titties, you know. - With big titties. So what happened, man? What happened with the guidance counselor? - Huh, huh? What? Oh! You mean big titty Dorothy? Dorothy herself is a very nice lady. She's out of my wheelhouse. So I said thank you very much ma'am, it's fixed, I came down the ladder and I went about my business and left. - I call bullshit. But I gotta hit the head, I'm out. - So what really happened? What do you think? I thanked her properly. I got out of there. - Well one of us had to be an adult. Oh come on. - Nah, I gotta go pick up Alexis, man. Okay. - So Lisa finally let you out, huh? - Yeah, she ain't the boss of me. Now look, I do what I want when I want, how I wanna do it. She knows that. - Okay. You will learn, grasshopper. - She thinks I'm at the store. - I'm sure. Don't forget the eggs and milk on the way home. - I never do. He's in cardiac arrest, get the code cart! Call 911! All right come on, pull him over. I got the cord underneath. Start compressions. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. No pulse. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Come on, Fred. One, two, three, four, five. - Change of color. One, two, three, four, five. Come on, Fred. One, two, three, four, five. Pull that curtain. - Oh shit. Greg. Greg, stop. Oh my god, Greg, stop. - I want this off. Don't touch those lines. - I wanna get out of here! Get these off me! - I understand. - Get them off, I wanna get out of here. Okay, - You can't just leave him there. - I understand. He's being taken care of. Let's sit back, Greg, come on. These lines have your blood in them. You can't pull them out because you'll lose blood and you need it to be back. Greg, these lines have your blood in them, okay? And if you pull them out, you're gonna lose blood. - Have her close the curtain. Have her close the curtain, I don't wanna see that. - I'm gonna close the curtain. I need you to sit back. - Please. - If these lines come out of your arm, - I wanna go home, I wanna go home. - You're gonna go home pretty soon. Come on, sit back. If these lines come out of your arm, you're gonna lose blood, okay? If you lose too much blood you're gonna bleed to death. I don't wanna scare you but that's what's really gonna happen. So you need to make sure you stay in here. - Hey. There he is. You okay? Hey, Jake. Seriously man, you okay? This morning go all right? - Do you fear death? - Do I fear death? Lost me on that one. - I moved up. Yeah I tried talking to my doctor but honestly he seems like dude's speaking another language, you know. - No, it's simple. You just have to keep up with your screenings, communicate with your doctors, but never miss any anti-rejection medication. - Yeah, yeah, aren't there like a bunch of side effects or something? - You just have to keep telling yourself that you're getting better. But honestly, I never thought I would dance again. What, don't give me that what, where is it? - Hey! - Answer me! Did you mess with my-- - Put me half on! - Where is it, seriously? Did you mess with me? Oh wait, that way. You did it? - Whoever did! - No! No! Stop! No! Good evening, Mr. Jake. - How you doing? - All right, you? My name is nurse Adams and I will be your nurse for this evening. Okay? - Right. All right. There he is. There he is. - Hey. - You look like shit. - Good to see you too, man. Good to be back. - So how you feeling? - I feel different. In a good way though. - That's good, that's good. - Is Alexis here? - Ah, I made the phone call but they couldn't make it. Good afternoon, Mr. Warren, how are you feeling today? Well everything looks good. Just a few lifestyle things to keep in mind from now on. I'll be giving you a few pamphlets to help you remember what you need and all the pills you'll be receiving as you'll be on long term multi-drug therapy which includes the Tacrolimus, the Cyclosporine, the antiproliferative agents as well as the Prednisone. Now please keep in mind that this is long term so you will be taking these drugs for the rest of your life because the body can reject the foreign kidney at any time. I cannot pinpoint as to when the body will accept it and when the body will not accept it. - So you wanna interrogate me about my private conversation with my sister but you don't wanna tell me about something that's gonna affect both of us? - Both of us, huh? - Uh huh. Oh this is rich. You seriously don't think that this affects anybody else? You think it's all you? You don't see how it affects Alexis or how it affects me? You think you're the only one dealing with it and that's reality to you? Wow, that is grand. Do you know what happens when you don't feel good and you have to lie down? Which I get it, I get it, you don't feel good, you need to lie down. In the meantime, life goes on. So I have to get off from work early, which is docking pay, and we can't be doing that, so I can pick up Alexis. And I still have to take care of everyone and everything and be home and make dinner. - I didn't ask for your help. - See and that is your problem. You don't accept help. You want to act like you're this big guy, you have it all together. In the meantime, I'm burnt out. I'm tired! I'm stressed out of my fricking mind because I have to take care of you, I have to take care of Alexis, I take care of everyone except for me. So I have to be, I have to be the wife, I have to be the mom, I have to be the cook, I have to be the chauffeur, so yes, when something like this happens, you tell me about it! It's like I don't understand this. You just sit there. You sit there whether or not you have dialysis. And I just feel like I'm in this world like all alone. And I have to beg, I have to beg my husband to talk to me? How am I supposed to help you and support you if you don't let me? You have to talk to me, I need to know what's happening. - I said I'll take care of it, all right? Can we just leave it at that? Sound good? - You know Bianca offered to help us with-- - I've been waiting a long time for this, man. Hey man, I love you. Welcome back man, seriously. - Thanks, man. - I'm not ready to take over this paperwork again but somebody's gotta do it. Hey but who's talking about work right now? Tonight's the night for celebration. - Thank you all so much. It means a lot, seriously. Everybody have your back, that's right. - Yeah man, so, what do you think, man, you ready to get back to this thing? - I'm ready, I'm ready. I'll be back. - All right well it's good to see you looking good, nephew. - Thanks Unc, appreciate it. I'm just happy to be done with all the dialysis nonsense man. Seven years, takes a toll on you but I mean I gotta deal with this handful of horse pills but I'll be all right. - Dude looks like a junky, man. - Shut up. - Yeah you start going through side effects, you know, you seeing stuff, tell me. Hallucinating. - Really? - You could tell him. - Listen man, come on man. How many you had tonight? Pills or drinks? Come on. - Okay, on that note, I'm out of here. - All right. - All right, nephew. Right there. You boys be good. - Old man made it out, boy. You all right? - Yeah I'm good, I'm good. - You're all right. - All right man, I'll see you. - All right. I gotta use the bathroom anyway. - Police have not yet released an official statement but as soon as they do, we will post the information on Twitter and on our website. And if anybody has any information, please call the tip line number on your screen. It will be very helpful to authorities. Reporting live from Governor Prince Park, Jennifer Landis, WSKD news. Back to you. We ask that all residents in the Philadelphia area use extreme caution when traveling outside their homes. We are doing everything we can in our power to find answers that could lead us to ensuring-- - See this shit? WSKD's Jennifer Landis is live from Governor Prince Park. We spoke to some residents, and-- - Probably deserved it. - What the hell makes you an authority? Here's what one local resident had to say. You know sometimes I just feel like an outsider. - I think that is so true. People treat you differently, you know. I am so sick of hearing, "Oh, everything's gonna be just fine." That is meaningless to me. I just wanna be treated like a human being again, you know? That's why I like coming here. You guys get it. - That's the point. A lot of people, they look at a group like this and they think it's just all about getting together, getting all misty-eyed and sharing our feelings. But it's not. It's a chance for all of us to come together and chat about what's going on in our lives. - It makes us feel good. - Yeah. - Exactly. As a community of people that have been through the transplant process. And you know what? If a few tears fall here or there, well that's okay. I'm not gonna tell anybody. - That's what it is. People just don't understand. No one wants to talk about it. Good luck, here's your new kidney and good luck trying not to piss yourself every night. And I change my bedsheets every night by the way. - Well you know, Tyler, if that's the worst side effect that you've gotta deal with, I think we're all gonna be just fine, right? - Well speaking of side effects, did you guys hear about this chick who, I don't know, after her transplant, it sort of changed her habits and personality? All right, so this girl never drank a day in her life, then after the transplant, all of a sudden she starts to crave this, I forgot the name of the beer but this one specific beer she starts to have this craving for. Turns out, the guy who she got the heart or liver or kidney, whatever it was, from, was this raging alcoholic but he only drank this one particular beer, that same beer that she was having these cravings for. That whole article is about something how she developed his memories and his personality traits. - Yeah I think I heard something like that, like somehow his memories got trapped inside the cells or something. - What was her name? The beer lady, what was her name? - Oh man, I have no idea. It's just some random stupid thing I read on the internet. I have no idea. - Unfortunately, one of the unfortunate consequences of cellular memory theory is that people dismiss people's experience. So an organ donor recipient may be dismissed as simply a little crazy or having hallucinations or maybe their meds need to be adjusted or something like that. One case of this is Diane McConnell, an author who wrote a book about this called "The Heart's Desire." Her book is about her experience as a recipient of an organ donation. And unfortunately it was dismissed and her husband who is a former councilman, he lost reelection to his campaign because she wasn't believed. I believe that it's important to listen to her story. I believe that there is enough evidence out there to at least warrant more research. I think we need more funding, I think we need more research for Diane McConnell and for other people. They deserve it. Thank you very much for watching my video. Please don't forget to like and subscribe and if you'd like more information about cellular memory theory or other theories that have to do with mind, body and science, please link at the website below. - Big dog up all night, huh? - Come here, I gotta show you something. Oh come on. - No, no, no, no, come here. Jake, come on. - Come here, come here, come here. I found it. Everything that I'm experiencing, people are experiencing this all around the world. - What is it? - So look, it's this concept called cellular memory theory, right? All right, it's this idea that cells aren't just, that memories aren't just stored in the brain. But they're also stored in the cells. Diane McConnell. Politician down in DC. She got a heart transplant. All of a sudden things started changing. Look at it yourself. - Jake, this is internet bullshit. - She got off, she wrote a book about it, Andrew! - I'm worried about you, okay? I'm worried about you. You're reading this internet bullshit all night long. You're up all night long frantic. I mean, you're freaking me out. I know you're going through some stuff but you're freaking me out a little bit. - She wrote a book about it. Everything, her entire personality changed. She started drink, it's all, it's all-- - I understand and I believe you. I'm just saying this is internet writing. I could have wrote this. I can write this stuff down and say that you're having problems with your kidney and I'm so an so from Arkansas and I can just post it. Do you understand, you're dealing with something real right now, but this is a different entity for us right now. You understand that, right? Look man, I'm just worried about you. I'm with you, I believe you. But this is, there's no sources, where's the sources? Right. It's just articles on the internet. What are you doing? Jake, what are you doing? - Checking the sources. - Jake. Checking the sources. - Grab me another beer? Thank you. You know when me and your dad were kids, we always dreamed of running our own business. Your grandfather would crack up laughing. He never thought your dad would sit still long enough to do his own taxes, let alone run a business. But he did. He did a hell of a job, man. You hear me? Hell of a job. After he died, I, uh, wasn't sure I could do it all alone. Then you stepped up. Saved the day. Couldn't have done it without you, man. He'd be proud of you, I'm proud of you. Man. - Thanks, Unc. Thank you. So you feeling all right, Jake? Keeping up with those pills? - Yeah, yeah. Haven't been sleeping too well though. - Well get to reading at night, or the TV. You'll get some sleep. - I read, Unc. You ever read anything on cell memory theory? It says um, this theory that says memories being stored not just in the mind but also in like the cells so it can be passed from person to person you know, doing like an organ transplant. Like there was this one kid, had a heart condition. And you know, just like any other kid, he liked to play. But mostly like play with his action figures and loved it. And so he goes get his heart transplant. And whole time he's in the hospital, playing with his action figures all the time. But after he came out, a little bit different. He doesn't wanna play with them anymore. He's like scared of them or something. So his mom, a little bit worried, she looked into it. And he just wanted to play in the basement now with his new imaginary friend Jimmy. Not in his room, but in the basement. - Yeah, yeah, I get it, the basement. - So he finds out, his donor died falling from a fourth story window reaching for an action figure. Fear of falling. Wow. - Guess what the kid's name was. - Oliver Twist? - Come on, guess. - Jimmy? - Yeah, the same name as his imaginary friend. - That's some story. - Diane. - Are you from Town Hall? - No, look, I-- - I thought it went by well. I would like to thank you for your continued support. - Listen, listen, listen, no, no, no. I read your book, it's happening. - Look, I'm sorry, I'm on a tight schedule. - Yeah I get that, just hear me out, look. Everything you wrote is happening to me. I need your help. - Call my office, set up an appointment for next week. Crista. - Not gonna have until next week. - The coroner has now arrived on the scene. We have further reason to believe that they have now recovered a victim but we're still not getting confirmation as to who the victim is. Authorities are taking every precaution. - Just minutes ago, it has been confirmed by the victim's family that 11 year old Tanner Moore of Yeadon, Pennsylvania was the body found in the Delaware river near the Chester Soccer Stadium. I'm Alex Wells. - Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I really think you're the only one that can help me. I read your book, and I've been experiencing some strange reactions ever since I got the surgery. - Surgery? - Yeah. - Transplant? Go ahead. Care to elaborate? - I don't want to get into all that. - Look, if you didn't want to talk about it, you shouldn't have come here. - Wait, you wrote the book on everything I'm experiencing. I thought I was losing my mind. - It can have that effect. Nobody wants to think they're walking around with a possessed organ. What'd you have replaced? - My kidney. But look, I know you did the research. I need to check out this donor. - That's what you came here for? I'm afraid you're gonna leave disappointed. - You can't possibly tell me that you don't know how to track him down. Look, I've read your book, all right? - Keep it down. - I read your book. You said that you found the family, you tracked them down, you spoke to them. - Stop. I'm telling you that knowing where the information is and obtaining that information are two entirely different things. - So point me in the right direction and I can handle it. - All right. The records of all transplant donors are maintained by the Health Resource and Service Administration. Their primary office is in DC but they've got satellite offices throughout the country. The east coast office is in Philly. Where? Right by the airport. - So I can just go there and get the records? Why, what's the problem? Security's extremely tight. They only allow access to authorized personnel. They check ID's at the door. They don't allow visitors. Short of calling in a bomb threat, I see no way of allowing you access to that building. How'd you get in? I have my contacts. - Who's your contact? - Sorry, I can't. - Look, you don't understand, all right? - Look, there's a mystery, you need to solve it. Trust me, I know. - I have these dreams of a woman, my donor being murdered. I see it every night. If I can't save her, I at least have to try to find out who murdered her. - You wanna know the truth? I don't even know if what happened to me was real. You don't either. Even now, I couldn't deny that everything that happened might have just been a coincidence. You follow this and it will consume you. It will destroy you from the inside out. All for something that might just be in your head. - Lisa! Lisa! Yeah come on Lisa, open up the door. - You're late picking up your daughter again. - Can you send Lisa down here real quick? - She doesn't want to talk to you. - Look, I don't feel like dealing with this right, Lisa, come down here talk-- - Go away! - Look, you know what, you don't have no idea what I'm dealing with right now. - No idea what you're dealing with? How about all the shit I'm dealing with because of you? When you're not there for Lisa, who's there, me. How about your daughter, who's there, me. You know, I'm starting to think that I'm a better parent than you. - You know, one day when you get your head out of your ass and you stop trying to live through my family you'll be able to get your own, now, right? So fuck you, Bianca, and fuck Lisa too. - Daddy? I had a conversation with Lisa. She was telling me about. - That's not how this conversation's going. What you think, this is some sort of intervention? You coming here? Ain't nothing to be concerned with, all right? - Hey look, the way I see it is, and I'm not just talking about Lisa. Look now, you haven't been coming to work, you're not answering any phone calls. This isn't you. - Do not come in my house patronizing me. - And then Andy. He's telling me about these hallucinations and nightmares. If you need help, get it. I mean you got support here. - You are not my father. You hear me? No matter how hard you try, you're not him. You and I both run this business. It's not yours, it's ours. So I'll come to work when I wanna work and I'll leave whenever I damn well please, all right? And you'll be satisfied with that. Most importantly. Stand up. Stand up. - Jake, what are you? - Henry. You are never to speak to my ex wife or my child ever again, do you understand me? Do you understand me? - This isn't you, man. - If you've seen the things that I've seen, you'd wish you were dead. Now get the hell out of my house. No! So Jake? - What's up? - Well. You left work, took off. What's up, where'd you go? - DC. - Huh? Oh DC, fuck were you in DC? - I found Diane. - You went to fucking DC to see Diane? - Yeah. - What are you trying to prove? - I don't have anything to prove to you. - Jake. Hey man, I'm sorry, I'm your friend, okay? Excuse me for caring. Right, we're concerned, everybody. You got a daughter. This addiction or obsession or whatever it is, you're gonna lose her, do you want that, huh? Do you want that? - Look, after everything that I showed you, you have to admit that there has to be at least some truth, some truth to this, all right? Everything. - Okay, okay, let's say it really is a murder. Okay? No I know it's a murder spec, I believe you. I know you're seeing this murder. - Okay. - Did you go to the police? - I checked every single police report, all right? There's no report of anything like this. I'm the only one who sees this. Look, there's nothing. There's nothing out there. - All right. When's the last time you slept? - Man how am I supposed to sleep now? - No, just hear me out. - Okay. - Go back to sleep, get back into the dream. Maybe we can figure out where the body is like a dumpster or a ditch, something. - Look, the dream only takes me to the room. I see the same thing every time. It just leads up to this point and then there's nothing after that. - Listen, I, I hate to ask this, okay? You're taking your medication, right? Did you take it? - I'll be damned if I let some deadbeat burnout lecture me on how to live my life, you understand that? - Yeah, yeah I do. Jake! Come on, man. Jake! I'm trying to help you. Every time I help, you leave. Jake! WSKD's Jennifer Landis is live from Governor Prince Park.

How do you say his name? Little Uzi vert. ¶ Drop top raindrop ¶ ¶ Look at them flickin them wrists ¶ - Hi. I'm Henry Warren. I'll let you in. - Mr. Warren? - Yeah. - When you're ready, I'll remove the curtain. Mr. Warren, can you please ID the body on the table? - I uh... I never had any children of my own. So Jake is the closest thing to a son I'll ever know. And I loved him very much. As I'm sure most of you here did as well. It's a sad day. But it's also a day of love. For that love brought us all here. All here to pay our final respects to a man for some who was a friend, some a family member. And to one, a father. Now Jake was special. I watched him grow from a little boy to a young man. A man with tremendous character and responsibility. He became a father and engrossed himself in the care, love and responsibility that only a parent could understand. I watched him go through a life changing tragedy. One that would devastate and humble the average person. And while facing his adversities, he showed courage and strength that should be an inspiration to everyone here. He was a fighter and he never gave up. He refused to let the cards that life dealt him force him to be anything less than a father, less than a friend and a man. Alexis, I know you don't understand everything that's going on here. But you will someday. I want you to know that you had the best father a little girl could ask for. He loved you with everything he had. Just know that he's gonna be watching over you everyday, protecting you. You officially have a guardian angel because your father's on duty. I read a quote somewhere. And it read, you don't understand the meaning of the word love until you have children. Jake, what did you do this for, Jake!? And I thought about the author of that quote and I thought they were wrong. When I think about it now, I understand. Your father had many, many challenges. But he was a fighter. And he took them on as they came. I don't think he'd held on as long as he did if not for his love for you. I have no doubt about that. But he had challenges. And as hard as he fought, he had to go. You know I see parts of him in you. - What do you see? - The good parts. The good parts. - It has been six months since 35 year old Jake Warren washed up on shore as the final victim of the waterfront murders. We pause for a moment to dive into the complexities of the case of a serial killer that simply vanished. The final victim was a family man of Philadelphia who had recently returned back to his work as a neighborhood HVAC technician. His loved ones say he had recently returned back to work after a kidney transplant which led investigators to the connection between the killer's victims. Each of them receiving an organ transplant around the same time. Forensic psychiatrist Alan Steingle believes the murders are a possible vendetta by a deranged transplant candidate facing their own helpless mortality. Still, the case remains unsolved as there are thousands in the Philadelphia area waiting for life-saving organ donations.
