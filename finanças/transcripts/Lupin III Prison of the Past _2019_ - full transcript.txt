Damnit! Sir. Sir. Inspector Zenigata. Lupin! It's me, sir! Goro Yatagarasu! Yata? Are you okay? You were having a nightmare... It's nothing. Just an old dream. This time, I came to this country not to keep him in a prison... But to keep him away from one. {\pos(192,73.867)\fad(100,0)}Prison of the Past {\pos(192,214.4)}In other news... {\pos(192,214.4)}Governments worldwide are in an uproar over a thief. {\pos(192,208.4)}An unprecedented death sentence {\pos(192,214.4)}was handed down to international criminal Hector Corbett Finnegan, {\pos(192,208.4)}who was arrested 12 years prior. {\pos(192,214.4)}His execution has been formally announced. Finnegan is currently incarcerated in El Guille Prison in the independent kingdom of Dorrente. His execution is scheduled to be carried out in El Guille Prison. Finnegan has stolen treasures from politicians around the world to give to the poor. People worldwide came to know him as a modern-day chivalrous thief. He also attracted a following among criminals whose lives were saved by him. He is said to be a match for Lupin the Third, the world-famous master thief. Hmm... Is that what they said? Hm? I got the feeling old man Zenigata's here now. Yes. Same. A chivalrous thief... Hey, I bought a guidebook from that place. Take the wheel. Huh? Then read it for me. Pull over. Featuring the Misericordia Church. Constructed to mourn Fio, the Prince of Dorrente, who died of illness several years ago. Prince Fio, huh? Pity, he was so young. Good-looking guy, too. There's a popular hymn about their rose garden and beautiful sisters. Let's go there later! You look grumpy, Goemon. Here! Hey! "See all sorts of local Dorrente specialties at the seaside festival with the unusual shape of El Guille Prison in the background, ending with a fireworks show that will leave any traveler awestruck!" ...is what it says. Sounds fun! Whoa, sword! What're you doing, Goemon?! I am not here to sightsee. Or do you have cause for such merriment? He's asking if you're getting tangled up with Fujiko again, Lupin. Whoa, watch it! Ow! Hot hot hot! The heat, the dust, not to mention the smoke is intolerable. Huh? What's with you, Goemon? I'm dead serious about this. Though this so-called master thief is nowhere near my level, Hector Corbett Finnegan has a pile of treasures stashed away. It'd be a waste if he got executed and ended up being a ghost. So I, the great Lupin, shall easily break him out and get the location of the treasure. Basically, our job this time is to steal away his death penalty. His execution draws nigh. How will you deal with others who are seeking his treasure? Whaaat, are you joking? Who else would come up with this plan? What truly vexes me is your lax demeanor! Eh? Jigen! Is that you? It is you, Jigen! It's me, Joe! Dynamite Joe! And is that your partner Lupin the Third next to ya? And in the rear...the samurai master Goemon. Uh... My little buddy Jigen's been a huge help. What was your name, sir? Dynamite...? Joe. A petty thief. Old mercenary partner of mine. Reckoned you'd be here, too. The guy who saved our asses is now gonna bite the dust. So now we gotta repay the favor! Honor among thieves, how old-fashioned is that? So here I am, storming in. You too, huh? Hmph. It's not just us. Word is that a bunch of guys from all over the world are coming to Dorrente to break Finnegan out. But the first and only guy who'll do the honors is yours truly, Dynamite Joe! Jigen, I ain't losin' to you. Well baby, smell ya later! Jerk! What was that for? Small country, but the scenery is top-notch. What is it, Goemon? This is personal not to Lupin but to you, Jigen. I shall not disparage your sense of honor. But if you wished to repay a debt, why did you not say so at the onset? Doesn't matter. That's just a coincidence. It's all ancient history. Lupin is frivolous, Jigen is ensnared by personal feelings. No one is taking this seriously. Lemme ask you then. Why did you tag along with us? To work, naturally. Oh really? I think it's because of your oh-so-chivalrous ancestor that you're just swooning over Finnegan. You're just a sap. You insult me! Bring it. Now don't fight. And Jigen, stop being so prickly and secretive. Oops. Fujiko? Yeah, yeah, we're here. Exactly where you told us to go. I'll get you the finest treasure. Looking forward to it. Hm? Oh... Line got cut off. Heh. Huff... This exotic food called "sand-uwich"... It is stale. These slices of meat, these Western pickles, this mustard... The flavors are gone, as if they are leftovers. You're the one who threw it aside. Like us, perhaps they have been together for too long. Lupin, he's comparing you to the bacon. Does that mean you're the pickles? Hmph! How impolite. Then I am the mustard! Hmph! Hey, it's the night of the festival! Now serving the late Prince Fio's favorite fried bread. It's delicious! Also got jerk chicken! Our diamonds and gold come directly from the royal palace. Just like the ones Prince Fio wore when he was alive. Hey there. Prince Fio's alive, I tell ya! Really! Y'know hoss, I'm the Prince. Really! Eh? Ugh... Thank ye! Dinner's here. Here. Bone-in deep-fried chicken for three. The city is bustling. That works in our favor. You know, the economy here's booming. It's been like that for years. After exhausting their gold and diamond mines they were impoverished for a long while. Recently they discovered some new mine or other. What is this? Yeah, just a sec. Alright, comin' in loud and clear! They must have been nuts, shaping a building like that. The famed Dorrente landmark El Guille Prison. 120 years ago, it was the royal castle, later remodeled and rebuilt into that. Said to be impregnable, of course. That's all the guidebook says. But we do have this diagram Fujiko sent us. Didn't I tell ya? I'm serious about this. But I dunno how seriously Fujiko's taking this... What do you mean? After analyzing this diagram, I found five infiltration routes into that prison. Basically, aside from the main route Fujiko showed me, there are four others. I take it Fujiko and some other guys are going for all five routes. My Fujicakes wouldn't do that! I believe in her! ...or so I thought. I had a hunch, so I traced and hacked Fujiko's data source to find this... {\fad(1000,200)\pos(188.229,224.057)}Flying Thief - Doc Heinz {\fad(500,200)\pos(188.229,224.057)}Heistbot Operators - Balmer Bros. {\fad(1000,200)\pos(188.229,224.057)}Brigand of 100 Beasts - Baron Orellana {\fad(1000,0)\pos(192,228.628)}Big Boom Bandit - Dynamite Joe Is that why she has been gone for so long? Men and women both have it tough. As you can see, she had them put on trackers and cameras. I see now. Dynamite Joe is in cahoots with Fujiko. You've got connections, Fujiko. A skillfully assembled band of thieves in a contest for who can successfully liberate Finnegan. We're not gonna lose this. The gold medal's gonna be Finnegan's treasure. Let's go get it. Tonight's the night of the yearly fireworks. Under the cover of all this racket, the contest will begin. To my dear Fujiko Mine: My apologies. I shall obtain the treasure from my savior, Finnegan. Once I have won, I shall rescue him who rescued me from being hunted by the Royal Air Force. That is all. We'll split the dough 50/50. Between us two? Moron! Between Fujiko and Finnegan! If we repay him for helping us during the Sicily thief war, then it'll be enough. That's right, bro! Mademoiselle Fujiko, I'm afraid that after I repay him, I shall have all the treasure! That is the law of the 100 Beasts! With this stolen card, the outside's no sweat. The problem is that door inside. If all goes to plan, your prize'll be half the treasure and a kiss from me, Fujiko. Make no mistake, this jailbreak doesn't just involve us. Lupin and his gang must be here as well. Bring it on!

Well, the death row inmate's cell is at the top floor. Get this helmet off me. Mine, too. Roger! Intruder sighted. Will eliminate. Crap, a guardbot. That puny thing's full of it! Sic 'em! Leave it to me, my brothers. Eliminate! Eliminate! Watch out! Whaaat? Third Son! Slowly... Slowly... Huh? Once more. Slowly... Slo- Ah! Eep! Intruder sighted! You will be subdued within three seconds! What rubbish! Beasts are not capable of counting down! Idiot. Who are you calling...? Aah! An idiot! Boom! Just a bit more, baby! Huh? Why aren't the jailers coming? Or guards? This is a trap! Crap! I'm trapped! Craaaap! With that, we're all prepared. Now it's time for the champs to make their grand entrance into the jailbreak olympics. Warden Lorensa. They chose this day, as I thought. After all, it's the night of the fireworks. Those fools. If only they left one death row convict alone... Hmph. Pretty harsh, Warden Lorensa. So this is the world-famous El Guille Prison. Such an incredible anti-intrusion system's gotta cost a fortune. Must be military-grade tech. Even so, Lupin will certainly be able to slip through. With our help, we'll be able to nab 'em all. The local police requested Inspector Zenigata, an ICPO officer dedicated full-time to Lupin, to be ready to be dispatched at any time. No need. El Guille is a symbol of Dorrente's power. Police intervention infringes on the authority of the kingdom. I understand. Although I respect your view, if you underestimate Lupin...! Warden Lorensa! At the front gate... Well... Wha?! I-Inspector Zenigata and... Beside him... There you are, Lupin. And up to your old tricks! Hey! Uh... Uh... Can you hear me? Hm? Don't be fooled by his old tricks, Warden Lorensa! That man there with my face is not Zenigata! It's Lupin! Hey! Outta my way! It's not like you to knock on the front door, Lu- {\a}What?! You even have my voice! Have you no shame, impostor?! I'm no impostor! I'm the real- If you're the real Zenigata, In August last year in Italy, the police superintendent treated me with what meal? Tell me! Uh... Well... Soba noodles, you idiot! {\a6}Soba: Japanese buckwheat noodles No, I don't think it was soba... Doesn't matter if it was soba or not! Warden Lorensa, look at how flustered he is. That is the ICPO's secret technique. Do you see Inspector Zenigata's behavior? Next to him is Lupin's partner Daisuke Jigen in disguise. Now's your chance! Get 'em both now! Wha? There's no escape for you! Aah, wait, not so fast! My ID... Watch out, Warden! Aah! Owww! Sir! He was reaching for his gun. But...! Warden, I'll be right there. Until then, be on your guard! Hmph. Ah! Hya! Alright, we dive here! Ah! Intruders sighted! Sighted! Goemon, you're up. Very well. Eliminate! Huh? Huh... Warning! Within three seconds you will be subdued! Ugh... I'd rather not... I as well. Good to go. Get in, get in. Ugh... How sad is this? Am I now a dumpling? {\a6}Gyoza: Japanese dumplings filled with pork and vegetables So rude! Maybe I'll make a Dutch oven. Stop it! Let's go! Run! Don't trip! Oh my, we're all gonna freeze! Scary, scary! It is a dead end. According to my intel, we're almost at the cell. After this, we'll have to wing it. Here we are. It's unlocked. Lucky for us! Well, after this... We get first prize? Hey. It's you, Daisuke Jigen. I had a feeling someone would interfere out of a sense of gratitude. Nothing like that. I'm just after your treasure. It's never a good thing when thieves deal with thieves. You're...Finnegan? So you're Jigen's colleagues. Lupin the Third and Goemon Ishikawa. Charmed, I'm sure. Seems he knows us, Goemon. This is a cell, right? What a bother, getting special treatment. Who cares what cell I'm in...? Don't you think? Well, not that I'm boasting, but I've been in prison cells around the world. He is boasting. Yeah, he's trying to one-up him. But a cell big enough to play catch? That's a new one. Lookit you, Mr. Big Shot. No... Nothing compared to you. I wanted to meet you for a long time. I admire you as a fellow thief. Well, you're pretty honest. I think I'm gonna like you. Alright. Let's go get what we were looking for. First, let's get outta here. Then, let's go get your treasure together. How 'bout it? Sounds fun! Let's go. What are you looking for? Hm... According to my intel, El Guille Prison has some sort of mechanism in case of emergencies. There are crevices all over the place here. A mechanism? Yeah. It's never been used since the kingdom's founding. I don't really know what it does. But the King at the time left a will saying it's not to be used unless the kingdom's on the brink of ruin. Pretty morbid stuff. Indeed. Hup! Well, if that's what they say... Now I really wanna know what it does. Hm... Pardon... Did you check here properly? Huh? Oh, there it is! What is it? It's really nice having someone rescue you. I've always been the rescuer. That one time, if you hadn't given money to my employer I'd have died in a war between a bunch of strangers. Are you going to thank me? I am thanking you. It's not just me. Today, a bunch of guys risked their necks for you. Yeah. I know. Weird... I thought we'd be outside by now. Maybe we're here right now... No, aren't we here? Nay, here. My sense of direction isn't so bad that I can't find an exit... Ah! Sir Finnegan. That hidden passage... How did you come to know it? Well... El Guille is actually my home. What?! Whoa! Aaah! Hrm! Hm. Finnegan! Damnit! You bastard! Huh? Oof! Owww... You little...! Get down here, Finnegan! Oh? My, my... If it isn't the warden. What's going on, Finnegan? Hmph. If I saved your life before, then I can use your life however I like. Well, Warden, I brought the thieves to you. Thank you, Mr. Finnegan. You thieves dare to underestimate El Guille? What?! That toy's a little present from me. I haven't lost my thieving skills. Hold your fire! Get them! We'll brute-force it! Let's go, Jigen! Yeah! Berthet! Goemon! Lupin! Goemon! Gimme your hand, Goemon! Sorry! Damn! Ow! Berthet, see if they're still alive! Ma'am! The death penalty for Finnegan, huh? It was all just smoke and mirrors. This jailbreak is nothing more than an annoyance. Sorry, Jigen. Hmph. Not very hungry but I gotta keep my strength up. Pretty gross. Daisuke Jigen! Out! Lookin' good, baby. Jigen, gunman. Joe, bomber. Bang! Are you that stupid? Can't take a joke... Huh, nice set of goods we got here. Family, background, property, all checked. These'll fetch a high price. What's with this guy?! One mask after another! Hello! ...after another! He called us goods. We're here to be sold. Keep quiet! Third Son! Is Third Son okay? His battery... We gotta charge it or...! "The pheasant that stays quiet does not get shot..." {\a6}(A Japanese proverb) Africa has that kind of owl, right? Hm? Oh. You're awake. Sir, did you...? I do not know the location of your partner who fell with you. That bearded fellow was taken prisoner. Lupin is lost, then? Hm. Where are we? The royal palace, at one time. Some years back, Dorrente was plagued with a disease. Then the Prince, Fio, died of illness. After the Royal Family was gone, the building later collapsed in a disaster. A mere shadow of its past glory. You have my gratitude for saving my life. I am Goemon Ishikawa the Thirteenth. I am Berthet, a swordsman. Pardon the mask, but I must not remove it. You have no reason to thank me. If you were not protecting your partners, I would be at the mercy of that sword. Ah, how impolite... I am being impolite. Food is key for regaining stamina. Please. Mm... You have incredible skill. Why are you with those other two? You would do quite well by yourself. I thank you for your concern. However... You should return. Back to that devious, cruel warden. I wish to go back, but I cannot now. Due to the disturbance, I am to stay on this island until further notice. And secretly, Warden Lorensa... We are done here. Next time we meet, we meet as enemies. It is best we avoid each other from now on. This kingdom has a legend. When this kingdom is to fall, a swordsman of light who even cuts lightning shall arise to save the people. I thought it was a mere legend. I could not believe in it. That is, before I saw you cleave a bullet last night. What are you saying? Before that devil Finnegan came, for many years, this kingdom was on the brink of ruin. Sir Goemon. You are that swordsman of light. Please, save this kingdom. What...? A thief becoming a legend, how laughable. That said... If a country relies on one man to survive, it shall perish. There is more to the legend. Before the swordsman of light departs, he shall leave a pupil. Sir Goemon, please draw your sword once more! I shall receive your attacks and learn from them! Ow! I used the back of the sword. Your arms cannot learn from this sword. I see that you hesitate to defend yourself with your sword. You were not ordered here. Rather, you will not to go back until you are fearless in battle. I certainly tried to protect myself. I can only be called a coward. I regret to say, there is something I must save before I can save your kingdom. Damn that Goemon... Ow ow ow! Oh, and poor little Jigen... Eww, gross! Whoa, hot hot hot hot hot! Let's keep our oceans clean... Sheesh, because all this random crap gets thrown away... Huh? A globe? Wow! I'm saved! My plan of action is... Dry my clothes... Fill my tummy... Gonna borrow this... Oh, how embarrassing! Knife and fork... Put on some salt... Bon appetit! Got salt. If only I had wine... Ew, bitter! Oh well, better than nothing. We should filter the seawater. Rust! Rust! Ooh, that really suits you. Let's go! The treasure's waiting! Oooh. Maybe it's not wine we need. Turning on lights. Off we go! Oooh. Don't die on me. What's that? Ah, that's it for me... Thanks, li'l Balmer bro. Hm? Hm... Huh? Sorry, old man, I don't have time to rescue people. M... My neck... Sheesh... Hey, are those files for the old guy downstairs? That's right. Huh? Who're...? Whoa! Too weak 'cause I haven't eaten... Pipe down, would ya?! Fujicakes? How long are you gonna plug my nose? Sheesh. What's with you, Lupin? I came all this way to meet you. What took you so long? Aww, how sweet! All this time your heart's been aching for me! This guy... What? Says here, Dorrente's king is currently ill and cannot be seen by the public. What? No way! Bingo. The old man on the left's the current King of Dorrente. Instead of being ill... He's being confined? This country and El Guille Prison... This is becoming more interesting than I thought. The prince who died of illness. Mmph! What's wrong? Bah! Whew... Should've had some water... Besides that, look at this. Hm? The King's x-rays? He said his neck hurts. It's not because he's sick. Some sort of device? They did some nasty stuff to the old man. Hm? What's this? Man... What an appetite. Hey, open up! We're real! Ugh... What a sloppy bunch. All they have to do is check to confirm we're real ICPO officers. A stern reprimand should- You're naive, Yata. We're way past that stage now. You guys really are from the ICPO, huh? You finally realized that! Get us- All the same, you're not getting out. What do you mean? Waah! Ya gotta help me! I ain't no cop! I ain't know this Zenigata! I'm just a dealer who got hired by some guy named Lupin! Seriously...? Please! Get me out! Shut up! You think this little act will save you? Hm! Hm? What's this...? Whoa! Ow ow ow! Tell me the door code! 3-0-1-2-4-5-9-7! Idiot! What good is that if you can't hit the buttons? Yata. Gimme all the buttons on your clothes. Y-Yes! U-U-Uh, my pants buttons, too? Of course! Yata. Grab this and go over there. Yes. Ow! Ow ow ow! 3{\alpha&HFF} 0 1 2 4 5 3 0{\alpha&HFF} 1 2 4 5 Huh? 3 0 1{\alpha&HFF} 2 4 5 3 0 1 2{\alpha&HFF} 4 5 3 0 1 2 4{\alpha&HFF} 5 Amazing! 3 0 1 2 4 5 Aah! Stop it! Quiet down! Ow! Oof... 7! Sir, that was really amazing! Hmph! All those years chasing Lupin weren't for nothing. Wow! Monkey see, monkey do, right? {\a6}(He's saying a Japanese proverb with a somewhat similar meaning) Who's a monkey?! Sir, your pants... Hrm? Hmph! Nice heart boxers, Yata. Huh? Oh, my! Let's go, Yata. Something's going on. We'll investigate. My, my. Those guys on the boat are terrorists from around the world. I'm getting some bad vibes from these guys. Not the kind of people I'd like to hang around. Oh, those're guns. They've also got brand-new military-grade heavy weapons. If they're loading this stuff on boats, it must mean this prison is a weapons factory. I don't think they have facilities for that. Hmm. Next. Eh? A heliport's up there? Inside the building, actually. Whatever! Well, what a surprise. This is amazing. The seemingly impenetrable El Guille Prison. In reality, it's a marketplace for arms dealers. With all that, this place is virtually a fortress. Yow, I really hit on something big here. Thanks to me! Oh! Hey, is that...? Look, Lupin! Treasures! Diamonds and gold! That dirty warden! That's just a portion! Finnegan has a supply network for warlords. Warden Lorensa is providing a place for arms deals in this country. They make a good team. The rumor was, Dorrente's mines were exhausted. So how are they still able to export gold and diamonds? Now I know. I'm so smart! So this is Finnegan's treasure. Huh? Hm? I want it! That'll be my present, right, Lupin? You're killing me! Don't be absurd! I went through a whole lot of crap to get here, thanks to you. The great thing about you guys is you never stop, no matter what. Well, we guys are now about to break up. Oh?

Fujiko, you're up. Eh? Oh... Whoa! Man, no choice now... Freeze, ICPO! Wha? Isn't that Fujiko? That means... Uh... Gotcha! What's this?! Play along. Stop resisting! How'd you escape? Your flunky's taking a nap in a cell now. Ooh, darn it all! You captured me once again! Get moving! Warden Lorensa. We'll sell him, too. Yes. Leave that man here. Bring the other ICPO officer. Ma'am. Sell? Sell what? Too many slip-ups, Warden Lorensa. The corpses of the two who fell into the sea... Due to your reckless shooting. We're still looking for them. Wow! That's a serious obsession. Wha?! Lupin! What? Don't come here! It's not like I have a choice! Daisuke Jigen. Hey. It's been a while. Been snooping around? Stop acting so familiar. Now I feel like a thief. Some more goods arrived. Stuff for the bargain bin. Let's get on with it, quickly. The customers are getting restless. Now's your chance. Let's go have a look. Yeah. Sounds fun. Begin. Well then. All you proud warriors... Have a look at the price list. In appreciation for your patronage, all of our goods are top-shelf. This prisoner is Doc Heinz. Officially an aircraft engine manufacturer from Europe. Hold him hostage for a solid 20 million euro ransom. I, Skarlatos, crunched the numbers. We'll buy him. Certainly. Consider using him for your next weapons purchase. Next up: Baron Orellana. Eep! Don't notice me, don't notice me... On his privately owned island, this thief has hidden away all the treasures he stole. No! We'll buy! His service is simple. Just a little torture, and you'll find the location real quick. Alright, we'll do that! Don't do that! That's awful. Those bastards are selling prisoners as funding for terrorists. Disgusting! I'll... I'll never{\alpha&HFF} stand for this! I'll never stand for this! I'll never, ever stand for this! This goddamn place... You're a disgrace to what prisons represent! Justice and order! The hope that criminals will atone! While wearing a badge, you... You turned this place into a slave market! Hope, you say? I'm a specialist in hope. Tell him, Lorensa. Our kingdom was saved by the gold we earned here. And here we have order! Oh, looks like you lost that argument. Next, the bargains. The ICPO investigator, Zenigata. Make a cop your plaything and blow off some steam. We'll also throw in his junior flunky. Huh! They've got bad taste... Oh, and I forgot. Also up for grabs, Daisuke Jigen. Hm? A petty thief, but you can get a bounty off him. Or, get a ransom from his partner, the second-rate thief Lupin the Third. Oh wait, Lupin's dead. Stop being so crass, Skarlatos. Oh? Nobody? Getting cold feet? Well then, useless goods will be taken off the shelf. W-Where'd you get that?! I got one from those boxes there. T-That's overkill! I missed. W-What's this?! Aw, crap. His aim sucks... Ow! Hot! Sir, I'll save you! Ow ow ow ow! It's those guys. Fire! We'll test out this missile! Whoa, stop! Each one is $100,000! W-We're done for today. We'll wait till you contact us. Damnit! Pay up! All of you, die! Wait while I- Leave it to me. Huh? As I expected from a gearhead like you! This, too. Aaah! Sorry, Jigen. Don't die. What?! Aaah! What do we do? Sir! Hot, hot! Aaah! Idiot! Get back! After them! Go! Roger! Aaah! The diamonds... Aah! Where are they?

Give me a clear shot! Roger! This is bad! Hm? Whoa! Whoa! We did it! We got rid of that nuisance! But... That... It's hitting that side... And bouncing back! Nooo! Let's run, Jigen! It's no use, so stop floundering. What? Are you trying to pick a fight?! Then what do we do? Hurry... Give me the order to return! Sir. Good. You're okay, Yata. If you were gonna come, then come sooner! I was searching for this. Thanks. But no hat. Hat. It's all dry now. That makes me happy. Now all I need is my magnum and this country's finest smokes. Don't get greedy now. Then... I'll give you this. Huh? You think gum can replace tobacco? We're surrounded. Hm. A mere trifle. They think they can get through us? Run away! Huh? Guys? Sir? They've escaped! Start shooting! Oh crap! Sir, wait for me! What're you doing, Yata?! Times like this, you run! I wasn't listening! It's called a strategic withdraw. Grow up, Yata. Okay... Hm? "El Guille Prison, where even a mouse can't escape" my ass! Huh, Warden Lorensa? Crap. You know very well that we must not let these guys escape, no matter what! By any means necessary. Guerrillas, arms dealers, prisoners, guards... They all need to get along. That remote... What's he trying to do? So, Warden Lorensa. O spirit of Dorrente. Do not forgive my sins. But protect this kingdom. Wait, Warden Lorensa. What are you trying to do? Oh? Perhaps you're activating what you must not unless the kingdom's in ruin? What? That mechanism? Eh? What do you mean? Didn't you read the guidebook? Eh? They wouldn't put that in a guidebook. It's a secret. Hm. Well, I get that it's some dangerous mechanism. Quiet, thief! I will not be quiet, Lorensa. I've been through a lot of crap. That lying bastard, Finnegan will be seemingly executed, then continue to control El Guille while thinking of ways to take over the kingdom itself. Lorensa, I know why you're taking part in all this. The King of Dorrente's life is on the line, isn't it? With that bomb in his neck. I knew it! It was a bomb! What's Lupin saying? Jigen. Get ready to shoot Finnegan. Huh? I'm unarmed. Got this earlier. Theft by finding, huh? And this is a treasure. Being a thief suits you. This'll probably sell for $10,000. Huh? Monkey see, monkey do, huh... And you put in one bullet. It's okay, Lorensa. You don't have to listen to him anymore. Don't worry. Fact is, I passed by the cell where the King is being kept. Reprogramming it was a cinch. Now, if you hit the button, all the bomb will give you is dead silence. Quiet... Quiet, thief! You think I'd believe that? C'mon... Believe me. It's a bluff. We didn't have enough time for that. So Jigen... It's up to you, Fujiko... Jigen... That Lupin... Always weak to a woman's tears. Is... Is it true? Is the King... Pretty sad you fell for that, Lorensa. It's time to grieve for your king! Ah! You're what I call a gunman, Jigen! Got it! Now the King's safe! Nay, we are too late. Lorensa... You didn't have the guts to shoot me. That was close, Lorensa. Lupin... I'm a thief. Of course you wouldn't believe me. El Guille Prison, attention all staff. This is Warden Lorensa. Prison guards, temporarily release prisoners. Repeat, temporarily release prisoners. I'm sorry. Although I was under duress, I... Lorensa, have activated the wall sealing mechanism. All staff... Everyone... All of you, stay safe. Don't die. Lorensa, watch out! Whoa! What's this? What indeed. Whew! Aaah! Wait, where's Finnegan? Everyone, listen. To ensure that the Royal Family survives, openings all over the sealed walls have been made that only the royalty knows. After getting the locations of those openings, he destroyed the Royal Family without anyone knowing. So you won't know the locations of those openings. Neither do I. Please... Find an opening somehow. Even if it's just one of you... Stay alive. Whoa! Your driving's terrible! The box'll fall off! The kingdom's ours even without it. I always take double, triple precautions. Money and jewels. Goemon. Can we use that? Yes. It seems it will move without difficulty. However, at best it will seat two or three. Two is plenty. Zenigata and my bro Yanakarasu will ride. Yatagarasu! Whatever. Why am I and Yata the only ones riding this thing? Hmm, my phone took a swim and can't dial 110. Lupin! What about you guys? What, did you forget? I can escape from any prison. It's a gift, huh? What a piece of work. You watching, Finnegan? Old man Zenigata's breaking out! Your misdeeds will be known the world over! Prepare yourself! Crap, not yet! Go! Well... Now what? Huh? The Royal Family knows all the openings, right? Then we have no choice but to go to the King. It's still safe here. Now's our chance. Run. It is coming. Whoa, no chance! There are stairs here. Then we'll go this way. Lupin, see ya later! What? Fujicakes? Worry not about Fujiko, but us! Aaah! Goemon, use Zantetsuken! Chop-chop! What? I cannot cut through a long block of rock! {\a6}Kintaro ame: Long, cylindrical candy with shapes or faces on it This is fun! I shall try! I... I get it, Goemon! T-That's enough! I have tried! I know that! Are they okay? Those thieves? If it's Lupin, he's fine. Kill him and he still won't die. Worried? Our fault, Goemon. Yeah. We overworked you out of convenience. Forgive us. So long as you know. We are partners. Yeah. Okay, here we are. We'll go downstairs through that door. Hm? Is that the King? That's right. We gotta rescue him quickly. Yeah. Our own lives depend on it. Posthaste. Huh? Silly, of course your key card won't open it. That's right. Lupin! The thieves! Hold on, no welcome back hugs yet. Uh... Would you...? Certainly. Might wanna hurry! What Lupin said! Aaah! W-Who... Who the hell's telling me to watch where I'm moving?! Hey, you! Stop touching me! Ouch! That is not me! You have the wrong person! Apologies. That's me. Oh. His Majesty? He's got a pulse, breath... He's alive. Aah, what is happening? Your Majesty... I am Minister Orso's daughter, Lorensa. Ah... It's Lorensa. What is happening? Could this be...? I have activated the sealing mechanism. I failed in your absence. I cannot be excused. Ease up, old man. Lorensa did that to protect your life. Who are you? Me? I'm just a lowdown{\alpha&HFF} chivalrous thief. I'm just a lowdown chivalrous thief. The chivalrous thief Lupin the Third and his partners. Hm? He tried to help me... And I... Made the mistake of not believing him... Is that so? Truth be told, I once wanted to see El Guille like this. Lorensa. I am the one who made a mistake. I was at the mercy of that wicked Finnegan. So many lives of the royalty were lost. I was left to rot in this prison. And my son, Fio... I was told he passed away. What a cruel world. I dread to go outside. My heart is closed. I am no longer fit to be King... Your Majesty, please listen. Lord Fio... Lord Fio is still alive. Hm. To protect his life, I decided to announce his death. What?! Then... Prince Fio is well. His face and social status hidden... He has guarded me as a swordsman all this time... What? Could that Berthet fellow be...? So this kingdom's future in Prince Fio's hands... This kingdom's revival... Will without doubt be full of promise! Right now, until he gets word from me, he's hidden away at the royal palace. Wait! Goemon! Hm? Excuse me! This is bad. Royal palace, huh? The local police... They're finally here. But...the bridge has collapsed, and the way in... That idiot Lupin. Throwing me all the way out here... Mouthing off about escaping from any prison... His last prison just had to be...this... This place controlled by some dirtbag... Unacceptable! I will never stand for this! S-Sir! Lupin? It's not Lupin. Huh? What?! "The captive king has been stolen from imprisonment." "Signed, Lupin the Third" Look! Utterly shameless, that guy! That Lupin, he's done it again! That son of a bitch! S-Sir! Sir! Hm? What's that? That's... Lupin, isn't it? Whoever it is, after 'em! Yes, sir! Whoa! You're losing your edge, Skarlatos. No way, those were warning shots. Ah! Gah! Eep! Oof! Aah! Don't go! Get on, Warden. Let's go. Fujiko! Was it that fast? Isn't that a speeding violation? Huh? Was there a speed sign? Why are you in the driver's seat, Lupin? Well, I've always wanted to try this thing out. Cute, isn't it? Tch! There's a gift from Finnegan in the back. To Mr. Jigen. Huh... My magnum. Now get in. We're going after him. Well? What did he write? A love letter? Says he's returning this cheap gun. I should at least put jewels in the grip. That prick! Uff... Closer... Get closer! Crap! Hm? There you are, Jigen. I'm too easy on them... Not good, he's shooting! Huh? Uh-oh! Huh? Whoa! Watch out for that pest above! Roger! Prince Fio's cute, isn't he? What? At a time like this? Crap! Can't hit 'em! His aim's terrible! Naw, that grenade launcher's tricky even for me. Kinda pity him. I saw the Prince's pictures though it was his medical data. That was data for plastic surgery. Plus... You...! Huh? No mistake. That was a mask. The surgery's already done. Skarlatos, we're almost at the royal palace. Let's end with a little fireworks show! Roger! That's... Lorensa! Get closer, Miss...? Fujiko. Fujiko Mine. Please, Fujiko. Lord Fio... Need this? If you're jumping off, don't you need this? Thank you. But I'm okay. They're coming! Shoot them down! Yes, yes! Hoo-wee, little Lorensa's gonna jump down! Jigen. Plug your ears. Y-Yeah! Huh? You go, Lorensa! Yow, this is incredible. This is... Skarlatos! Get rid of that woman! Understood. Eyes up, bitch! Hm? Put that down. Why? If you need to fight one-on-one, it doesn't matter if you're a man or woman. Then again, I really wanna rescue my love! What a worthless jape. That wasn't a joke! Oooh. Quickly, finish her! Understand? Those jewels and gold are our lifeline if we fail to take over the kingdom! This kingdom is our dream! Yeesh, this scumbag's talking about his dreams. Stupid. We thieves are so much more modest in our dreams. Yes. We won't stand for this! We'll smash their dreams to pieces! Too slow! We have a scooter engine. Press on, press on! Bastard! You really stole Lord Fio's face! Unforgivable! Your fight's with me! Aah! Augh! Ow! Ow ow ow! You...! Master Finnegan! Ah! Lorensa. Ah! Please, Lupin. Save the Prince... The kingdom. Take care of that wound. It's soaked with seawater, so it might sting. Right... Back on topic. What was it? Save the Prince and the kingdom? I've been waiting for those words! But if you said, "Please save me!" I'd be more motivated. Sorry... But this isn't for me. Aw, you're so adamant, but I'll let it slide. Leave it to me, princess. The nerve...! I'm not a princess! Whoa! Huh? Hey, how do you do, Prince? You did well to hide for so long. That's why you're in no condition to save this country. I'll take over for you. No outward changes. But I have the strength to endure pain and fear, and to save the people. Bringing a sword to a gun fight... Give up. Your sun's beginning to set, and mine is rising. Sir Goemon... If a country relies on one man to survive, it shall perish. Lord Fio! Lorensa! You! You soil your precious Prince's face with blood! Please run, Lord Fio! Hey there, any closer... Leave me behind! Lorensa! Lord Fio, you're the Prince! Please protect yourself! That is right. I am the Prince. Even if there is no swordsman of light, I cannot run away. The one who is to save my kingdom shall not be someone from some place. Lord Fio! It is I! For I am the Prince. This will not stand! You who have defiled my kingdom! How amusing. At this range, I won't miss your heart. Now fight! Mr. Samurai. Giving up? Huh? What's this? What're you doing? I'm asking you a question! Lord Fio! What?! How? I used the back of the sword. Lord Fio. The swordsman of light! Now this is treasure. Talk about bad taste. It's a golden Nazi gun. Splendid, Sir Berthet. Rather... Prince Fio. Sir Goemon. Lupin would probably want this. Roughly $300,000? Lorensa... Your wound... Lord Fio, my blood sullies you. One who does not know the beauty of this blood is no prince at all. Lord Fio. Unbecoming as it is, the workmanship is splendid. Yeah. Fio. F-Father! You're safe! Prince Fio. I now ask of thee... Who shall be the new king? It shall be myself. What is a king? A king is not protected by his kingdom or his people. He is their protector. He is a shield forged from knowledge of the past and a sword who shall clear the way to the future. Ah... Elegantly spoken, Lord Fio. Hm... There you have it, old man. Well said, Fio! The day I entrust the kingdom to thee has arrived. Y-You! As Lorensa said, When I came, I made the poor citizens here rich. What's evil about that? I'm a chivalrous thief! I steal, and I give. Can you people do that? Instead of mining some mountain, I am excavating diamonds and gold from the veins of warfare. There shall be wealth without theft. I am the succeeding King, not a thief. If you asked me five minutes ago... I probably would have said I would not push this button. But you - and this kingdom - end here. Along with me! That is... Man, not another dangerous fireworks show... No one can escape! It's flying towards this transmitter! Sheesh... "A thief who's a match for Lupin" my butt! Hey, don't point. Disguises, thieving... I'm way above your level! You disguised yourself as the King expressly to say that? Lupin. Here. H-Hey! What're...! Fireworks! {\a6}Tamaya: A traditional chant during a fireworks show Whoa! Whoooa! Yikes... The money... The treasures... Oh? This doesn't inspire confidence... These are all the police officers in all of Dorrente? Because it's a peaceful country. Oh? Pops is gonna arrest us with that many police officers? Well, between a thief who lost his will and a Dorrente samurai master, there's no problem. We came all this way to save you from execution. You'll be sentenced once again. Finnegan. Long ago, you saved me from certain death. You from back then, and you from now... When did you change? I haven't changed at all. I... Ah! Hm? Then and now... I was always saving people. Being a thief is the only way I can do that. Hmph. Like you said, it isn't good when thieves deal with thieves. Let's go, Jigen. Oh yeah! Mr. Prince... Eep! What was that? Next time I come... I'm taking the princess. So take care of her. Princess...? Quiet! You really are just a thief! See ya! There they go... Who is the princess? That's just a thief talking. She's cute, that warden. Oh? Did you want to stay? Nah. She'd be hard to steal. You're shameless! Watch it! I'm gonna fall! Stop! I said stop! Stop, please! Sir, Lupin is getting away. Hmph. Yata. You will return that. Uh... Yes! Yeesh, I understand. Hmph... Let Lupin be. Focus on Finnegan and his underling. Roger! I'll chase you wherever you run. I will always chase after Lupin. And I will throw him into prison, again and again! Again and again? Ah! Meaning you intend to let him escape. Stop laughing, Yata! Sorry! Grrr! This isn't the end! Prepare yourself! Lupin! {\pos(192,214.4)}In other news... {\pos(192,214.4)}Three weeks ago, {\pos(192,214.4)}A massive weapons smuggling ring was exposed. {\pos(192,214.4)}This is great news for Dorrente. Long reported as deceased, Prince Fio was confirmed to be alive. His accession to the throne has been officially decided. In recognition of the new King, the people are holding a celebration. Alright, we're redoing the festival! This fried bread Prince Fio ate yesterday is delicious! How about the jerk chicken Prince Fio's addicted to? Ya know, the one who revived Prince Fio was me. Really! Now, Prince - or rather - King Fio will make a comment. Now switching to footage. A king's first job is to build the future. This country will start again from scratch. Together, let us work hard to rebuild. A country's treasure is its people! The ringleader of the weapons smuggling ring, Hector Corbett Finnegan, was again arrested and investigated by the ICPO. He has disclosed his smuggling routes one by one. Supporting evidence has also been uncovered. If everything comes to light, this criminal network will be eradicated. We have a camera on location. What? Huh? Yes, reporting to you on location. Excavation work has been well underway. Time of completion is- Oh? These guys. Oooh, the Balmers' little bro is okay! Oh, got some mail. From Fujiko! Waaaah! Lupin Lupin Lupin Lupin the Third Lupin Lupin Lupin Lupin the Third I'm the one everybody's waiting for (Waiting for) Scream for me, a romantic modern hero (Hero) They need a hero, somebody they can look up to Lupin Lupin Lupin Lupin the Third Lupin Lupin Lupin Lupin the Third I'm a superhero (You're a superhero) I'm a superhero (You're a superhero) I'm a superhero (You're a superhero) The hero of today, yeah Everyone wishes they could be like me (Like you) Smart and cool, handsome, wealthy and so sexy (Sexy) They need a hero, somebody who is just like me Lupin Lupin Lupin Lupin the Third Lupin Lupin Lupin Lupin the Third C'mon, man... What a greedy bunch! Same as us. That is right. Yes, yes! Over there. The car wreck is here, but... That's strange. Lupin, you did it! Hm? Run! If we're caught, we'll be bunkmates with Finnegan! Eek! Hurry up! Now and then we have moments like these. Hmph. Rarely, you mean. Goemon. Why are you with those other two? You would do quite well by yourself. That is, why do I not fight by myself? Hmph. Perhaps for this. You said something? Nay. Delicious! This mustard's real zesty! These Western pickles use delectable brine. The bacon's doing a great job. One day, I shall certainly lend my gratitude to the ones who delivered our kingdom from the prison of the past. To that band of thieves.
