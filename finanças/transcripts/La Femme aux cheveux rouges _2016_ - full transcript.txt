Help! Help! No! Please! Help! Mercy! THE WOMAN WITH RED HAIR Hello. Henri? Are you staying long in Burgundy? I don't know. What do you do all day? Nothing. Wander around. Listen to Gregorian chants... I'm doing better. That's great! And at night? As Woody Allen says, "I sleep like a baby: "I wake up every 2 hours and start crying." You want to come back to Paris? I need to be alone. I have to get through this. When will you be ready to go back there? Eva! I'll find someone to replace you but it can't be forever. I know. - Take care. - You too. Eva! Eva! Red! In the water... What about another one? No! We must go. Come on guys! Jeanne, one more please. But that's the last one! Eva, Eva! Calm down, Juju. Stop being silly. In the water... Eva! Stop being silly! You can't behave like that, you know it! Eva's not here. She's in the sky. In the water... He's so annoying! Mrs. Naudy, can I have a coffee please? - Eva! - Will he ever shut up? There must be better ways to calm him down. What do you know? You're not from here. That's enough! Come on, Beaubay. Let's go. It'll be OK, buddy. Eva... - Hey, mommy! - Constance. - It's been so long. - Are you OK? Juju! We're not friends anymore? You forgot about me? - Constance? - Yes! Constance! Come here! I'm so happy to see you. See you later. Who's that? Antoine Cardona. He's visiting the Abbeys. He's writing a book about the region. Juju is stuck on him. I'm so glad you're here! Me too. Will you stay? A few days. I don't know yet. I went by the house near the pond. It must be looking bad. - You still got the keys? - Why? I want to sell it. It's time to leave the past behind and I also need money for my new garage. - Can I help you? - Why not? All right then! Did you like my crawfish? Delicious, Mrs. Naudy! I eat a lot here. Would you like a desert? I've got some lemon meringue pie. You'll tell me if it's good! I'm really full. Next time. I promise. - Good night. - Sleep well my dear. Mr. Cardona, are you leaving next week finally? I might stay a bit longer, if that's OK. - Sure. Time for bed. Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hello. Are you on vacation? Maybe... Who's Eva? My mother. Jeanne took me in when I was 4, after my parents died. She couldn't have children. So it was convenient. She's beautiful. Like you. You look very similar. Don't flirt with me, I'm not in the mood. - Nor am I. See you at the inn. No, wait! Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm being oversensitive at this moment. I've not been back since, so it feels weird. I need to empty it out and throw everything away. Why don't you renovate it? It's a magical place. "Magical" or evil. I don't belong here anymore. My father was a mechanic. Hence my passion for motorbikes. What happened to him? Hunting accident, few months after my mother died. So what are you doing? Are you going back or... I'm going to the Saint-Gilles Abbey. I'll take you there, if you're not scared. Thanks. Will you stay long? I'll go buy some things. You've never been in here? Yes. At funerals. All the old parts have been burnt twice. Except the crypt. The cloister is amazing. You must see this light. Antoine, are you OK? I'm OK. Come. I'll show you my favorite place. Miss Lacassan... I'm glad to see you again. May the Abbey give you what you're looking for. People built it with their hands, they curved every stone, but it's God who made it look so beautiful. - I'm going. - Come back whenever you like. - Thanks. Wait. You don't seem to like the priest much. - He's a dick! - What did he do? He refused to do my mother's funeral, because she had killed herself. - Why did she kill herself? - No idea! My father died right after, so he couldn't tell me. I'm sorry. I don't want to talk or think about it. I've come back in order to put an end to this. "A botched investigation? "Right after he came out of prison his wife killed herself. "Louis Lacassan thereupon died mysteriously at a hunting accident. "He always claimed innocent. "The villagers took the law into their hands. "Martin Rossi." Excuse me. Can I talk to journalist Martin Rossi? I'm an investigator and 20 years ago, he wrote an article I'm interested in. Rossi? Doesn't ring a bell. Wait. Yes. He was a freelancer. But he's not working for us anymore. - You know where he is? - No. He was a high school teacher. Maybe he still is. Thank you. Is it also for your book? Is my life so interesting? I found out something. Jeanne's told me everything. It's complicated. You were 4. That's none of your concern. I don't want to know. Mind your own business. Is it you, Constance? Come in. - Am I interrupting? - No. I'm resting. I can work in the bar if you need. Tell me about you. - Are you OK? - Yes. Are you seeing anyone? No. It's over. I'm not easy with men. I take them, I dump them... - I don't commit. - Why? When it's too serious, I get scared. So I leave first. Stop being silly. - Did you go back to the house? - Yes. I found a musical mill. It reminded me of a song... that mom used to sing to me. I had forgotten... her voice and her smile. What's the point of doing this? When I was young I thought she'd left me a letter for later on. She didn't. She loved you. Eva was my friend, and she loved you. Not enough. Really not enough. Not enough to make her want to live. MARIUS ROBERT HIGH SCHOOL What have I done? Take his glasses. - Not my glasses. - Calm down. - Give me your bag. - Gently. You won't intervene? They'll think I protect him so they'll hate him more. It'll be worse. So you ignore them? Of course. It's like that all the time. You don't know. That's enough. Let him go. We're just joking around. Stop joking then! Why are you here? I'm looking for Martin Rossi. He was transferred in 1990, or maybe 1991. National Education... Because of the article in the local press? Which one? "Saint-Gilles, a village takes the law in their hands." - Rings a bell? - No. Lacassan, accident or murder? You don't remember? Young Constance got you into all this? It must have been shocking at the time. And Rossi left, right after. Far from here. You're being paranoid. - You think there's a conspiracy? - Rossi did. Who went hunting that day? Everyone? Yes. A wild boar group hunting. So you were there too. Did you know Louis Lacassan? Oh! Calm down! We weren't part of the same group. He had no true ideals. What does this mean? A right wing anarchist. That was not a reason to kill him. I've left that behind. My youth dreams seem very far now. Investigation's over. I've got a class. It was an accident, a stray bullet. Everyone's forgotten about it. Do the same. There are more important things in the world. Can I have a beer please? What were you looking for at the journal? News travel fast, I see. Everyone knows each other here. We see you around. Are you a journalist or a writer? I'm interested in religion. Are you investigating? This case was closed 20 years ago. Why are you sniffing around? - Calm down. The media think they're better than the police! Press freedom is sacred. I respect journalists, Rimski. But those who take risks, in Mali, or in Syria. Burgundy is for cowards. I'm not a journalist anymore. If there's nothing to find out, why are you so upset? Goodnight. Come in. I brought you some food. You didn't have to. I could have come down. You've heard enough for tonight. And these alcoholics won't go soon. I wonder how Jeanne puts up with them. Were you really a journalist? It's been a long time since. I'm sorry for earlier today. Your story brought back my old habits. It's none of my business. This is what you found? Yes. - Can I read it? - It's for you. I figured you'd be interested in it. Did you know your father had been arrested? Accident or murder? Did you know it? No one does, especially not Mr. Cardona. Don't let him influence you. Come. Mr. Cardona. I've got a seminar next week. They might be very noisy. There's no problem if you wish to get a room elsewhere. I'll think about it, Mrs. Naudy. Oh no! Oh no, that's horrible! Did you do that? No, you didn't! Get in! Shit! Come. Forget it. Do you recognize them? Yes. That's Eva. His face rings a bell. Look harder. It's that teacher! What's his name again? Nieskens? Rimski and officer Beaubay. My mother's friends. "Gang of Four." Were they all in love with her? But she fell for my father, Louis. He was arrested because of them. It was a short item, but their names are here. They accused him of murdering your mother. Constance, can I have a drink? - You don't seem well. - I'm fine! What's wrong, Constance? I've got a question. Why did you report my father? For revenge? Is that Parisian setting you against us? Do you trust him? - Are you in love? - That's nonsense! She's in love! Reply! Are you afraid? What do you want to know? Why did you hate him? You accused him without evidence. - But everybody knew. - "Knew" what? Nothing. I've had enough of this silence! It's been 25 years! No one speaks! That's why I left. The truth is not always easy. Make yourself clear. He was a scumbag. You were jealous of him! Of Lacassan? That's insane. You wanted to be in his place. He married Eva. This girl's is something! Your mother didn't deserve that. But no one forced her to marry Lacassan. She was very beautiful. She fell for an asshole. I forbid you to talk like this. You forbid. You want to know or not? Do you? Your father was a brute. He would beat Eva up. He knocked her down! - He'd have turned against you too. - Beaubay, don't say that. Your mother wasn't drowned. He hit her head. Then took her to the pond and killed her to make it seem like she was drowned. That's the truth. No. You have no evidence. You think it's easy for us to tell you all that? We couldn't prove it, but we were certain. OK. Fair enough. Everyone in the village thought he killed Eva, and when the police let him out, you shot him like a rabbit. - Constance. - You were furious, so you made it look like an accident. Constance, shut up! You're going too far! Remember who you're talking to. Which one of you did it? Do you realize what you just said? He's a policeman. Which side are you on? Which side? Do I need to prove it after all these years? I'm sorry for your daughter, Eva. You'll wake everyone up! - We knew. - Shut up! - We could've done something. - It's the past! - Go home. - You're pissing me off, Nieskens! - Can you hear me? - Oh, calm down! Get the fuck out of here. It's a warning! You're pissing me off! - I didn't mean it. - You did! I don't deserve this. I'm sorry. You could've talked to me. Your father was violent. Eva had told me. That doesn't mean he killed her. Maybe she killed herself because of him, but we don't really know what happened. Who found her at the pond? Juju. Poor kid! Was I with him? No. We were together all the time. He was alone. Leave me alone now. I saw Constance. She seemed sad. Is she in trouble? This guy, Antoine Cardona. He's going too far, he has to stop. It's not good for her. It's malaria fever. I'm used to it. Help! Help me! Mercy! You look amazing. It suits her, right? You behave funnily. I'm the one who behaves funnily? You're intimidating. Because I look like my mother dressed like this? I thought she was more romantic. Thanks for that! People say I look like a tomboy. Here I am, dressed as a girl. Did I say that? Everyone does. Not you. I like you as you are, tomboy or girl. I need to breathe. I'm about to break down. With all my mother's dresses... I can't go back to the house, I only see ghosts. I need to leave all this behind me. A small ride to Cluny. Please. I'd be grateful. So formel. I really want it. Let me go and change. "The Abbey of Cluny preaches chastity "and holy obedience to its followers. "Moral reform needs Saints "and a convinced, committed parish, sharing the same ideals." It sends shivers down my spine! I know. But Cluny gave the Church three Popes. It was the most powerful Abbey of Christianity. The anteroom of Heaven. You're obsessed with abbeys. Not obsessed. Nor mystic. Roman architecture heals the soul. What makes you say that? In Mali, I acted like a liaison between the villages. We built schools and trained teachers. One day, Boko Haram came. They were on motorbikes and on 4x4. We ran behind the bushes to hide the students, but they followed us and kept shooting. When things calmed down, we found 25 dead bodies. Among them, 6 children, less than 10 years old. They burnt down the village and took all the young girls to sell them, or for forced marriages. I knew them all. I knew their faces. - I couldn't save them. - No. You did what you had to do. You protected the kids. If you had stayed, you'd be dead. I can't live with this. You don't want to? I do. Of course I do. But I want us to take our time. I didn't expect feeling like this again. I thought it'd never happen again. What? Desire. What are you doing here? Why are you here? What do you want? Juju! Where did she drown? I don't know. Try to remember please. Where did you find her? I can't remember. Eva, Eva! Was Eva here? Are you sure? Here. - Father. - "The father"? Father. Juju, please, concentrate. We're not playing games. You saw Eva here? Was my father with her? Father. It seems like people like you here. Yes, people like me. It's a gift. Do you need help? The engine won't start. It's the battery. No, it's the Delco. Someone unplugged it. Shit! That's incredible. Come on, try. Thanks. Be careful. I don't want my father's story to be repeated. Someone wrote "Get out of here", and I shall obey? Is that a joke? I'm not laughing. Can you take me to the Abbey of Saint-Gilles? - I don't want to go alone. - OK. You've been touched by grace? I'm looking for a monk. Which one? The one who wanted to speak to me last time. You were captivated by the prior and the cloister's light. Ask the monk at the gate. Ask what? I don't even know his name. These are cells. We can't do that. Can you hear that? A reptile's teeth mark. It's a viper. It took a few hours... A snake in the monastery! It's gone now. You had to intervene immediately. Brother Ambroise was at the hermitage. Why would we worry? You'd better be next time. The visiting hours are over. Thanks for understanding. Please leave us. We'll hold a vigil tonight. I'm sure that brother Ambroise found the light he was searching. It's a year of vipers. I could have saved Ambroise. I doubt it. It was too late. I could have tried. Why didn't they call me? What do I know? You know how they are! You know them well? Ambroise and I went to the monastery together. But he stayed. He believed. He was loyal to the Order. Were you a monk? In my previous life. Ambroise was losing his mind. - Why? - The doctor said so. He whipped himself. Abuse... His body was a big wound, he went mad. No, he wasn't mad. He was desperate. He told you so? I heard his silence. When he came at my place, he seemed more peaceful than there. No more ghosts. Dirty bitch! Get out of here! Shit! Where's the doctor? - What's wrong? - Viper's bite. - Quickly. - It's itching. Not the doctor. Rimski. After the grand lime tree, the house next to it. I prefer to see the doctor. The first road after the lake. Thanks. - Hello? - Is doctor Michel there? He's not here. He's seeing people at their home. - Cauterize it with a blowtorch. - "A blowtorch"? I'm kidding. It's not very bad. Relax, this will be quite hot. There you go. Your blood looks like ink. If you want to know if I'm a journalist, the answer is no. Your friends know it. Any after-effects? Maybe some fever tonight. My last patient was Juju. He burnt his hands while pouring Pomace down the chimney. I gave him some cow dung. "Cow dung"? An old healer's remedy. Tell me something. Where was the viper? In Lacassan's house or garden? In my car. I was driving. You had left the doors open? Maybe. At some point. What did you do to him? - So much about trust! Drink. - No! - Don't drink. - What is it? A beverage to treat the poison. If anything happens to him, I'll sue you. - Are you OK? - It's over. The monks taught me how to treat viper bites. It's like a vaccine, you treat the evil with evil. Why did you leave the Order? - "Why? Why?" Come with me. We're off. I've got a bad feeling. Come on. You don't need an Abbey to believe. I have the soul of a Cistercian. I prefer the Earth. What's a Cistercian? It's someone who doesn't ask questions. It's an attitude. It means living alone, and contemplate. It means knowing that words and reason mean nothing. You talk a lot, you think. You're a Cluniac. Do you grow snakes here? I hate it. They have a bad reputation but it's unfair. We can tell the good from the bad, thanks to them. Even if we lost our innocence. That applies to my father's accident. We all kill someone in our heads. Even you. No? - He's creepy! - I like him, he's got a character. He's impressed you. He's got wit. I'm feeling better. You trust him? He could have hurt you when you were alone. He's a mystic. Why would he kill me? Because you nose around. They want you to go! First the car, now you. It wasn't fatal. It could have been! They'll get you. You've not seen enough in Africa? - I don't want you to die. - I won't. You need to return to Paris. - You can do without me? - Don't joke. I don't want to leave you. They won't hurt me. I'm very selfish. I need you, I need to be with you. - Come to Paris with me. - No. I need to know. I need to get through this. I can't run away again. If I go to Paris, I will lose you. I'm glad, though, that my potential death might upset you. I dreamt of my mother. She was running away, at the pond. I always have this dream. This time, someone was watching her drowning. It was a monk, I think. Rimski was in the Order. - A dream or a memory? - I don't know. Why would he kill her? - And then accuse your father? - So he killed him. You're out of your mind. - I'm sure he's involved in this. - He was a monk. Not a criminal or a psychopath. Why did he leave the monastery? He might have lost his faith. Maybe they kicked him out to avoid a scandal? Can you give me your car keys? I want to take some furniture to Jeanne. - Shall I come with you? - No. Have some rest. There're no more snakes, I hope. Why did you cure him? - You should have left him die. - He's done nothing wrong! He sticks his nose into everything! He'd end up like Ambroise? Why are you saying that? It's a year of vipers. "A year of vipers." You bought into that? No! You don't want to know. - What do you mean? - Nothing! Say what you want! What's the problem? A viper going into a monastery, fair enough. But another attacking in a car... They mutate? - It's the pesticides! - Your problem is that Cardona is eating your brain! - You drink too much! - Let's stay united! He's trying to turn us against each other. We used to agree! "A year of vipers", my ass! Attention, Jeanne! There's one behind you. - Where is he? - Cardona? - Yes, Antoine. - In his room. Are you worried? Henri, where are you? In Mali. You went back? No. There's no one there. They moved to Gao. For Anchawadi, any advice to gain some time? Yes, deal with the water before finishing the school. There's a well problem. - Be careful. - Don't worry. The zone is controlled by the army. - It's calmer where you are! - Debatable. And your nightmares? No more. I'm coming back to life. Is she pretty? Very. Check this out. There's some progress. "The walls that divide us don't reach to heaven." Juju! Juju. Who was there with Eva? He came to see my mother? Who was he? Father. It's the Father. I don't understand. Wasn't it my father? Am I interrupting? Yes, you are. To live happily, one must hide. Are you feeling better? Much better. I came to thank you. I did some research on Cistercians and Cluniacs. Both were in the same Order: the Benedictines. Correct. Black and white, like chess. Doves and crows. The full program. Have you been at Cluny? There's something troubling me. Why did you go to Lacassan's house? To chase the ghosts away. I promised Constance to clean up the closets. She's seen enough, Constance. The air here is bad. She's better off at Dijon. What's bad? What do you mean? Do you like her? Don't fool her. I'm not playing with her. Good. I wouldn't allow this. What is this young woman to you? You ask too many questions. Come with me. Working in the garden won't hurt you. It'll clear up your thoughts. I like you. Finally, we'll get along well. Come. It's for me. Have you known Rimski for long? "Rimski..." Since school. We've been through a lot together. He wasn't always a monk. Rimski fascinates people. Not me. Be careful, kid. This authoritarian man doesn't like resistance. When he speaks, we obey. Even with you? You're an officer. That's life. - Even your mother... - My mother? She was in love with him. He was her favorite. And what about him? God, your mother was beautiful! A true bomb. And he opted for the church... Like your Antoine Cardona. He spends so much time with the guy who killed your father. Rimski? Yes, Rimski. Rimski played with Eva like Cardona plays with you. If he hadn't gone to the monastery, she'd be alive. Why did you protect him? He had to pay for that. Antoine is trouble. That's what he is. He won't stay. He's lived abroad, he won't stay in a hole. Sooner or later he'll run off. Sooner than you think. Open your eyes, Constance. History's repeating itself. You'll end up alone, like Eva. You must try! I'm not good at it. - Constance, dinner time. - Leave me alone! What's wrong? Rimski killed my father. Beaubay told me. And you're his buddy! No, I'm not. I was trying to find out more. Liar! I saw you from the beginning. He tries to please you! Pathetic! OK. I'll try to find out why he left the Order. Open the door. We can't talk like this. - Go away! Constance! Go eat his fucking plants! Leave me alone! Constance, don't do that. Go away! I don't need you. - I don't need anyone. - I love you. No. You can't possibly love me. - You don't know me. - Yes, I do. This will never work. Yes, it will. We're good together. Because we fuck well? I'm writing an essay on Roman art. Can you tell me more about Cluny? With pleasure. I studied that period during my novitiate. Did you know that Cluny was very close with the Vatican? The Order was very prosperous. Before the Cistercians succeeded the Cluniacs? Yes. The Cistercians messed things up. They accused the Order for wealth and they praised poverty. But the Church has to be powerful. Rimski was a Cistercian. - That's why he left? - "Rimski." No. It was worse than that. He moved away from God due to a female seducer, a teaser who bewitched all the men in the village. He broke his vows out of love? Out of weakness. The only true love is God's love. Our vows are eternal. We commit to chastity and obeisance. Rimski had no excuse. He refused to admit that she was just... a whore! You mean Eva Lacassan? Let's return to your book, please. When is that seminar for? - You still want to me to go? - It's canceled. Eva was Rimski's great love, right? Yes! They loved each other. But he wanted to go to the monastery. So she married Lacassan when Rimski went to the Order. Lacassan beat her up. But maybe he knew that she loved someone else. Rimski knew it, he couldn't accept that violence. He broke his vows to protect her. Right? Right. That night, Eva was supposed to meet him. Lacassan didn't accept it. But who else knew? I don't know. I've been wondering. What's wrong? Are you OK? Ambroise talked to me, before the viper killed him. So you were there? At the pond? What are you talking about? Eva's death, what else? You knew she was meeting me that night. - What does that mean? - You wanted to stop her. You wanted her to yourself! You touched her? You kissed her? She pushed you, then you lost control? You're losing it! Ambroise recognized you. You saw him too. All these years, you made me believe it was Lacassan. Ambroise had gone mad. He talked nonsense. Lacassan killed her! Get out of here! You disgust me! She was still alive when I left. Yes. But you ran off. It's as if you had killed her. Get out of here! Nieskens! - Leave me alone! - What's wrong? I want to be alone. Get it? - I want to see the priest. - Come tomorrow. The brothers are meditating. It's important. It's a matter of life and death. He must see me. Father. 25 years ago, I saw Ambroise at the pond, the day when Eva Lacassan was found drowned. I never told anyone. What was he doing there? Why did he kill her? He didn't. She was already dead. He couldn't save her. He felt guilty for getting there late. He had seen you fighting with her. It was haunting him. How do you know? He had confessed it to me. He's resting in peace now. Contrary to you. She fell in the water. She tried to get up, she wasn't dead! That's what you wanted to believe in order to keep on living. It's not possible! Who can question the words of a man of the Church? Hello? Yes, Principal. Who? I'm coming! - Hello. - Hi. I'm looking for Rimski. He went to the forest. Thanks. Constance is your daughter, right? Rimski! I know you loved Eva. Dog roses calm stress, the Ballota nigra fight anxiety and the lemon balm sharpens the memory. - How's your memory? - A bit too sharp, sadly. You're wrong. Memories are precious in life. Why did Nieskens kill himself? What did he know? What are you doing here? Who are you protecting? Constance. I'm worried about her. It could be that I'm her father. Keep that to yourself. Eva made me swear I'd never say it. I watch over her. Otherwise I'd kill myself. When Jeanne Naudy's husband died I paid for her studies. You know she has a degree in engineering? Saint Bernard said we're carnal, that our love and desire start from the flesh. But I had refused that kind of love. Eva's smile was unimaginable. When you looked at her smiling, nothing else mattered. Her beauty was absolving. When she told me that... Constance was my daughter, I should've felt bad for betraying the Church, but... I was the happiest man on earth. So I confessed to the priest and admitted I was in love. I needed his benediction. He refused. I left the Order anyway. Was Eva going to leave Lacassan? For long I thought he killed her to stop her from coming to me. I am to be blamed. For what? For killing my father? Go on, Constance. Shoot! I'm not afraid to die. I feel so embarrassed. Life is absurd. Admit that you killed him. Let it out of your mouth! Lacassan was in my line of sight 25 years ago. I knew he wasn't a boar. I hadn't planned it, I shot him. And I was very happy about it, at the time. - The past is the past. - Let the gun down. Keep out of this. There's no excuse for me. I always thought Lacassan had killed her. It was convenient for me. I loved your mother so much. Her absence drove me crazy. But Ambroise wrote to me. It wasn't Lacassan! I'll never forgive myself. You're right. There's no excuse for me. I knew it. I knew that it wasn't my father. So who was it? You'll never find this letter. I need to know. Don't bother. Make yourself at home. I forgot something. Rimski knows. Don't think I'm a fool! Rimski went to the monastery. Get out of here. Always supportive, like 25 years ago. Get out of here or I'll arrest you! The Gang of Four. But Nieskens cracked. Did you select at random who would kill Lacassan? Why did you protect Rimski all this time? He killed a murderer. It's different. There's justice! Yes, but my father hadn't killed anyone. A brother is injured. The priest asked me to call you. You call the magicians for help now? That's new. He doesn't want a doctor. He wants you. What's wrong? Spain, fracture... The knee is swollen. He was repairing something in the cloister. He stepped through a board. He's still up there. After Ambroise, it's me? For me, you died 25 years ago. Ambroise was breaking. He punished himself for years. He's resting in peace now. He talked to you? He wrote. I wondered if he had time for that. I can't let one man's fault sully our community. "One man's fault"? You have a short memory. Some sacrifices are necessary. Our Lord gave his life... His life! Not that of others. Ambroise was under your influence. Eva died because of you. Who cares? Eva's life, Ambroise's life, yours, mine... We came from dust and we'll turn into dust again. The Church will survive! You've always been a fanatic. - You're crazy! - No! I am a guardian of the Cluniac tradition. I am a fighter. Rimski! I'll tell them you put the viper in Ambroise's room. Who will be next? I don't fear men's justice. I only fear God's justice. Leave him alone! For Ambroise, for Eva and for Constance. When did you find out? When I received Ambroise's letter. "You all accused Lacassan, "but I'm responsible for Eva's death. "I tried to talk to you, "I couldn't. "I owe you the truth." The Father demanded that I tell you nothing, Rimski. When you left the monastery he asked me to go and see her and convince her to leave you. You were his spiritual inheritor. He had great plans for you. He preferred you dying, especially her, instead of letting you go back and live with her. He didn't trust me. So he followed me. He was frustrated, as Eva wasn't alone. There was your friend. Not the policeman. He tried to kiss her. I don't know what he'd have done had she not ran away. She fell in the water. I tried to take her out. The priest stopped me. I couldn't move. I looked at her sinking. After all these years, I've not found peace. I can't keep this secret anymore. "I told the priest we owed you the truth. "I'm sorry. "Ambroise." It's hard to hear, but it's better than lying. It's better than everything I imagined. My mother didn't abandon me. She didn't kill herself. She loved me. And my father wasn't a murderer. I couldn't take that. I'll call you soon, mommy. You're liberated finally. - You'll come to see me? - Why wouldn't I? I love you so much. Be happy. My Juju, you'll always be my friend. - Take care of her. - I promise. Subtitles: Eclair Media
