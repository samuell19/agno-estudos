The news is excellent. He's as eager to get started as you are. - Good. - Good? Ha-ha. You Americans! It will be fantastic. Otto Abbot. The world's most famous big-game hunter and you, Harry Stanton the world's most famous big-game trapper. And together, you will bring back the Enchantress. - Think of the publicity. - When do I meet him? Of course, you will not forget that you are to bring back also two tigers. But it is the Enchantress that excites me. Such an animal. Once in a lifetime. Just imagine. Half tiger, half leopard, a magnificent accident of nature. We shall be the envy of every zoo in the world. - Schelling. - Yes? Otto Abbot. When do I meet him? Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Tonight. - At his house. At 8 o'clock. - Thank you. Of course, you realize, Harry, that I'm coming along not only to give you all the help I can but also in order to bring back a trophy worthy of this room. Otto, I am delighted you're coming along. Let me freshen that up for you. Thank you. [Harry] '"Italian Somaliland, 1930. Weight for the pair, 300 lbs."' Here's a fascinating thing about the elephant. He's terrified by the color white yet all his life he lives with it under his nose. That must be something of a record, isn't it? As matter of fact, everything in this room is a record. Otherwise I should have left it where I shot it. It can't be too easy, pulling the trigger on an elephant. I mean, uh, they seem to come from another age. It's a shame they couldn't stick around to decorate this age. - The trapper speaks. - I admit it. My friend, a charging elephant has one idea only to remove the hunter from this age and preferably by trampling him to death. Just as that panther there would have loved to have torn me into little pieces. I-I was after his mate. He didn't approve of that at all. He was quite right, you know. Every animal.. ...is entitled to kill in order to keep what belongs to him. Well, this one certainly felt entitled to kill. Schelling says, the Enchantress is a far better animal. Yeah. The cunning of the leopard, strength of the tiger. And an auburn colored coat. That'll be something to see. And that's a better animal? There's always a better one, Harry. That's why there's always one more hunt. Oh...incidentally since you're a man of experience I'm sure you'll agree that there can be only one leader on such a shikar. You're the expert in the Malay rain forest. This is my first trip. It is agreed then that I shall make all decisions. Of course. If you've never to the Pahang, the Malay rain forest it will interest you. [gunshot] Tropical flowers grow in the topmost branches and cobras in the lower ones. [cocks gun] [gunshot] In places the forest is so dense, the sun will never touch you, yet you'll feel you are breathing steam. [gunshot] The heat, the animals, the reptiles and the insects all of them can kill you. And all of them will try. - Any more good news? - Yes. Everything has been arranged in advance. Transport, supplies, personnel, the finest of equipment.. ..weather reports, clothing. All that remains is to capture two Malay tigers and the Enchantress. You don't mind if I wear my own clothes, do you? I took the precaution of finding out your various sizes. What you will need you'll have. Sounds like the work of a general staff. It is. [car door slamming] And I'd like to introduce you. [violin music] [music continues] Did you expect to see someone in uniform? That is the uniform that no man could fill, so.. Anna, may I present Mr. Harry Stanton. You already know his specifications. [Otto] 'You may as well know him.' 'Stanton, this is Anna, my general staff.' - Anna. - Mr. Stanton. Harry. Size...seven and a quarter, hat. Size, sixty, neck-band. Size, ten D shoes. I feel as if we'd met before. I'm sure we have, some of those dreams I've been having. - How was the concert, my dear? - It was a concert. Oh, Anna goes with us on the shikar. - That pleases you, Harry? - That delights me. But it surprises me a little. Anna goes with me on every hunt. [Otto] 'She's invaluable. The planning never stops, you know.' 'Also, when necessary, she can use a rifle.' 'Well, that lion up there is hers.' I also decide not to wash my hair when you're down to your last cup of water. I was, uh, just trying to picture that dress in the jungle and you in that dress. I wear trousers in a jungle. - Oh, size, huh-- - Ten. And she wears 'em very well. Have you had your shots, Mr. Stanton? Typhoid, cholera? I've had shots for everything but Julie. There are no shots for Anna. And there is no cure. After I bagged that rhino, I almost had to shoot my beaters - Oh, really? Why? - They wanted the horn. It's supposed to restore fading virility. The Chinese grind it to a powder and take it internally. But to the Malays, the magic is in the touch. - All magic is in the touch. - Sometimes it's in the air. You amuse me, Harry. I think I'm going to enjoy this expedition. Well, it shouldn't be too dull. And we agree on practically everything except possibly the animals. I still think they're only beautiful alive. And to me they're only beautiful dead. You said it. I regard myself as a very liberal man yet, very possessive. And so I seek only the finest, the most beautiful everywhere. And having found them.. ...I possess them. Harry, the beauty they may have in life is nothing to their beauty here. For, in life they die, but here they live forever. All of which only proves that man is the best of the animals. It proves that man is more adept to killing than the animals. Oh, so you would outlaw killing? Might not be a bad idea. But death is the law of the jungle. No, survival. But surely we're saying the same thing. How much longer would they have lived if I had not hunted them? A day, a month, perhaps a year. They point is, they were destined to die. How and when seems unimportant to me. There are people who might argue that point with you. People who think it is important. [Otto] 'And which do you think is important?' - 'How or when?' - 'I don't know.' How, I suppose. I don't think anyone really knows until the time comes. - What do you think, Anna? - What's the difference? Just bury me where and when I fall. That, my friend, is a hunter's answer. Well, shall we drink to the success of our shikarin Malaya? Why do you stare at my hands? Just trying to picture them holding a gun. The ring stays here, and the polish wears off. Does that help your picture? I can see you exactly. Size 10 trousers, no nail polish. And no nerves. Anna can handle any animal. Harry. Tomorrow morning, Harry. The airport at ten. I'll be there. Mr. Stanton to his hotel. [engine starting] Don't go with him, Otto. Hmm, you must either like him very much or not at all. Personally, I find him amusing. And I would say that you find him attractive uh, more than attractive. [Otto] 'Oh, it's no surprise, of course.' 'There've been others, a fairly long list of faceless men.' 'Well, why not add a big game-trapper to the list?' This one could have a face, Otto. You mean, he promises to be different? Yes. Oh, perhaps this is the moment to start a new category. Men with faces. And when that becomes boring, we can start another men with two faces. So long as I know, Anna. So long as you'll never leave me. And you never will. I could refuse to go along, Otto. Well, of course, you won't. You'll come because I want you to. Look, Anna, we don't play games, you and I. When we've something to say, we say it. You know, it's been nearly five years since we went to Pahang. - Are you sure you can, uh..? - Handle it? Of course. You underestimate me, my dear. I'm really looking forward to this expedition. You know, I've never hunted before with a man who thinks that animals shouldn't be killed. It'll be something new in my...our career. A hunt...with a man... with a face! Interesting. It'll be a novelty for both of us. [cocks gun] [gunshots] - More coffee? - Yes, please. Black. No cream, no sugar. As my grandmother used to say, you take it barefoot. It keeps me awake. 'I have a theory about being awake or being asleep.' It is only when you're asleep that you show what you really are. Sleep takes the mask off. What do you say, my dear? Does sleep take off my mask? Yes. Does it take off mine? You don't sleep, my dear.. ...you just close your eyes. [airplane droning] [stewardess] Ladies and gentlemen we're now passing over the Cathedral of St. Peters in Rome. 'The Saint Michelangelo designed and executed' 'its magnificent dome.' 'Architecturally, many consider it' 'to be one of the wonders of the world.' Do you suppose they've seen all the wonders of the world? There are some people who wouldn't even look if you said in a moment we would be passing overhead. [chuckles] How long have you been with Otto? How long? I was fourteen when he found me. In a church in the south of Italy. My mother was dead, my father.. 'I never knew my father.' My name was Maria Georgia. But Otto didn't like the sound of that. So, he called me Anna. I was crying when he found me. And I have not cried since. Nor have I been in a church. Fourteen. Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaya. Once British, now independent. The ancient, the very new. Too bad you didn't bring a dinner dress, my dear we could've gone dancing tonight. I love to dance. [light music] Oh, thank you. Well, you will have the Semang Malayan trackers for the jungle. Excellent. Eh, what about the head boy? The head boy is tough. A Malayan named Talib, who also speaks Sakai. - Very experienced. - Fine. Well, everything seems to be in order. The aircraft that would take you to the Pahang is ready. Well, we'll leave tomorrow morning, uh, about 8 o'clock. Yes, sir. - Good hunting. - Thank you. [music continues] You know, at this business of being a woman you're pretty good. Only thing I can't figure out is, how did Otto know what you're gonna turn out to be when you were only 14 years old? It wasn't a trade-off, I picked after. - Oh, you did? - Mm-hmm. And you knew then? What you were gonna mean to each other? - Mm-hmm. - How could you tell? By being pretty good at my business, pretty early. I see. Then, uh, you probably knew what I was thinking. The other night when you walked in to that trophy room. - Mm-hmm. - No, that's only part of it. I was just trying to figure out, uh.. ...how that brass plate above your bed must read. And how must it read? At such and such a place, in such and such a time.. ...taken by Otto Abbot. You were uh, fourteen when he found you? How old were you when he seduced you? You two dance well together. - With...or without music. - Prettiest couple on the floor. What did he report? All is in order, just as you planned it, my dear. We leave at eight in the morning. You will have Semang Malayan trackers. [Otto] 'There are none better.' And you never catch them looking at you but you always feel their eyes. What was it you wanted to tell me, Harry? - Suppose you'd tell me. - Very well. You want to tell me that Anna excites you. That you're going to take her away from me. No, no, don't worry. Anna and I have no secrets between us. None at all. [Harry scoffs] You dragged that out pretty flat on the table but, uh, as long as you did, yes, I'm gonna try. I hope you have no illusions about being the first to try. - Which number am I at? - Think what you like, Harry. If we're going to leave at 8 o'clock, I'm going to bed. - Goodnight...gentlemen. - Goodnight. When we're in the jungle, Harry we shall be amongst the Sakai people, they're very primitive. For instance they have no word for any number after three. After that they just say kermin. Which means more than three. I see. [Otto] 'I wonder if you really do, Harry.' But then perhaps you do, and if you do.. ...perhaps you've already decided not to try. [Harry chuckles] That'll be a little out of character. But surely you are out of character already. I mean, the role of the hunter. Oh, no, don't misunderstand me. I enjoy watching. Particularly when I can predict the outcome. Because I can here. Easily. [crowd applauding] No matter what happens no matter how many people try Anna always comes back to me. Goodnight, Harry. Come on in, it's not locked. - Well, hello. - Hello. Uh, just a minute, I'll try to make myself decent. Don't bother. Well, here comes one of those dreams again. This is what you expected, wasn't it? Honey...I never expect anything not until it actually happens. No, thanks. I owe you something. - Well, if you say so. - I owe you an answer. Oh. Otto didn't, as you charmingly put it, seduce me. - No? - No. He gave me everything. I have nothing to give in return except myself. But he took it. I wonder. What would you have done? [Anna chuckles] That began it. [Anna] 'And that ends it.' [Anna] 'Kuala Lumpur.' Room 225. And the brass plate reads "Not taken by Harry Stanton." Goodnight, Harry. [helicopter whirring] Well, as long as this lasts, we shall have to share. Almost everything. That's one of the things I like about you, Otto. You always come right to the point. Did you sleep well last night, Harry? How could I sleep? I had too many things on my mind. Oh, what did you have on your mind? That what we talked about last night was true. Last night. Maybe it will be true again sometime. Right now, the only thing I'm interested in is trapping two Malay tigers and a certain animal called the Enchantress. [engine sputtering] [sputtering continues] [engine normalizes] [speaking in foreign language] - Welcome. - Uh, you are Talib, I suppose? - Yes, Talib. Head boy. - Good. Speak English some. This Baka, top boy tracker. He's Sakai like the natives live here. Six trackers more. Two gun boys. Very good. Let's get over to the land rover. Hey, man. You speak Malay? No, pidgin, Hindustani, Swahili, no Malay. - We speak English. - That's a deal. Excuse, twan, I do not understand. - We speak English. - Oh. [speaking in foreign language] It is hot, isn't it? [Otto] 'There are only two kinds of weather here.' Hot or wet. [Harry] 'We better pray for rain then.' Prayers are reserved for the weak 'who wish to inherit the earth.' I believe that's the meek, isn't it? Now, you're changing the subject. Weren't you praying when the aircraft's motor failed? You'd know it. It's an old family custom. Now, we go. Tigers, twan? Tigers, Talib. It's a deal. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [snarls] [music continues] [Talib] 'Baka say plenty tigers here.' No enchantress. Enchantress, far place near God shrine. Well, now all we need are the beaters. [speaking in foreign language] The Sakai village isn't far from here. Baka will see to it. Twan,I keep for you. - Be your boy. - It's a deal. These Sakai, I assume they know what they're doing? Oh, it's never safe to assume anything about the Sakai. Oh, as beaters, fine. But...they're only once removed from the stone age. One moment they're like children and the next.. Well, let's just say they're...unpredictable. Anna. Feel like shooting some supper? No...I feel more like a bath. I'm a mess. - Harry? - No, you're the hunter. What would you like, my dear? Just don't shoot a pelanduk. Why the aversion to the pelanduk? I understand their meat is delicious. The pelanduk deer is a beautiful thing. People of Malaya love them and so do I. I was beginning to wonder if there was anything you loved. I haven't heard you say you love anything. What do you feel, Harry? I feel that you're different from any woman I've ever known. Last night when you walked out of my room made you different. Last night was for the slap in the face. About a brass plate over my bed. Oh...well, I had that coming I guess. Now, we're even? Alright, we're even. What happens now, Harry? That is entirely up to you. Oh, how wonderful and how like a man. You can always blame it on a woman, can't you? Look, I'm not looking for anyone to blame. I'm just trying to tell you that I read you wrong, that's all. Alright. You're a man, I'm a woman. Now, stay away from me. I give you...the pelanduk. Nothing can match it's flavor...anywhere. That wild west gun will not be of much use against Malay tigers, Harry. Oh, I don't shoot them, Otto. I just sprinkle a little salt on their tails. This is for those cobras that decorate the trees around here. News bad, twan. Last full moon, hunters came to Sakai village, kill men. Did not mean to kill. Now, Sakai not help catch animals. This always happen when I follow amateur hunters. The fools. [speaking in foreign language] Remember, Harry? Kerpin...means more than three killed. [speaking in foreign language] Here comes the headman himself. [speaking in foreign language] Oh, it's not enough he refuses to help, now he tells us to go. I suppose he's trying to frighten us 'with that rusty knife.' Tell him we came only to catch animals, not to kill. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Money's no good. [speaking in foreign language] Stubborn, I'd offered him everything there is-- [shouting in foreign language] Talib, tell him we're very sorry about the death of his men. [speaking in foreign language] He say good talk, men dead. I know. But there'll be no shooting unless it's absolutely necessary. 'We're not going to use those guns unless we're' 'in real danger, tell him that.' Otto, put the riffle down. [Otto] 'I'm not a fool, Harry.' That parang in the old boy's hands may be a useless toy but those spears are certainly tipped with poison. Twan,want him to take knife? Tell him to take it and keep it. [laughing] [speaking in foreign language] I shot the pelanduk for food. Pelanduk not for food, twan. It won't happen again, I give him my word. No, you tell him the knife is his whether he helps us or not. You promise not to shoot guns, he help. How do you say thanks in his language? - 'Kasih.' - Kasih. - 'That's good?' - 'Very good, twan.' 'He's friend with you now.' Well, tomorrow we catch tigers. Tell him that. Remind me to put one good machete on my expense account. I warned you, Otto, this one could have a face. [ominous music] Anna. [Talib] 'Twan.' What is it? Problems? Maybe...maybe not. Well, come on. Get it said. I think, you have no woman? Well, you think right. No woman. You like Chep? She stay with you. But Chep is your old lady, isn't she? Oh, yes. Plenty for two. [sighs] It's custom. Look. Chep is a beautiful girl and I'm honored but you keep her. - Twan,but-- - And take good care of her. - But I-- - I'll get my own one of these days. Come on, beat it. Go on. And uh, go on, go home. Just give her one little kiss from me, huh? [drums beating] [Harry] Check those lines up there. [speaking in foreign language] Twan,he seen tigers out there. Okay, you stay here. I'll go over there. And be ready in case they charge. Yes, twan. You tell Baka to put his men over there and back along here. And let's not cut that rope too soon, twan. [speaking in foreign language] [drum beats continue] We haven't been very useful here, have we? Well, what would you have me do, my dear? This is his shining hour. - There may be trouble. - Oh, hardly. What's a tiger more or less to the great Harry Stanton? Besides he's forbidden any use of my gun. I'm totally disarmed. Well...I'm going. I guess to a tiger that noise sounds like scratching your fingernails on a blackboard sounds to us. No wonder they try to get away from it. I'd run myself. Nobody runs forever. Not even a tiger. [drum beats continue] [snarling] [Harry] Talib. [growling] [Harry] 'Talib, reset that net.' [growling] Baka. [growling] [gunshot] Baka. [Harry] 'Let it go. There's still two out there.' Talib. Ready, twan. [Harry] 'Now, Talib.' [growling] [indistinct chatter] Good ones, both of them. Couple of days in the cages will cool them out. Talib? [speaking in foreign language] He say twanbroke promise, shoot gun. Were any of his men hurt? [speaking in foreign language] He say promise broke. Not help you no more, twan. Well...I guess he's right. I suppose we deserve that. Go help the men with the catch, Talib. I could have killed that tiger, you know, and I didn't. I did it your way. I fired in front in order to turn it away. Why don't we just forget about it, Otto? Then if Baka'd been clawed to death I suppose we'd simply forget that, too. Oh, Baka is an experienced tracker. I'm sure he'd have managed somehow. I suppose you'd like me to run after the old man and beg his forgiveness. Might not be a bad idea, but I'm afraid it's too late for that. [tiger growling] Twan. Men of village not help you no more. How you catch enchantress? Well, we'll just have to muddle through. We speak English. Look, um.. Baka said something about a Sakai shrine. You know where that is? Shrine three-four hour track. And maybe same time walk. That way. Hill country. Talib, you're something else. You happy, I happy. - The enchantress. - Twan? I was just wondering why nobody's ever captured her before. Maybe, like some woman. Takes something else. That maybe. Well...I guess it's time for sleep. Twan,you sure you not want Chep? No thanks, but uh...I'll get my own one of these days. Now, look, tomorrow.. ...when we leave, I got to leave two men with those tigers. I can't spare the trackers, so it's got to be the gun boys. Okay? Deal. Harry. Yes, ma'am. You are pretty good at your business too. Practice makes perfect Well, I guess that makes two of us. Doesn't it? Is that all you wanted to say? That's all. Goodnight, Harry. Goodnight. Wait, just a minute. Stop it, will you? - Stop it! - Talib sent. Talib sent. Go away. [Chep laughing] Hey, now, wait a minute. Just a minute. - Talib sent. - Uh-huh. Alright, come on, Talib sent. [Chep laughing] [instrumental music] - Hi,twan. - Don't "hi, twan" me. It's custom. Oh, it's a beautiful custom but it's your custom not mine. Now try and make her understand that. It's a deal. [ambient music] [music continues] [music continues] - Now, we walk, Twan. - Oh, that figures. Which way? That way. Okay. We travel light. We'll take the rations, the nets, the sleeping bags and the medicine box. - No guns? - And the guns. [speaking in foreign language] [pleasant music] [screaming] [dramatic music] [music continues] [Chep laughing] You characters. [snake hissing] [gunshot] The first rule of the hunters, Stanton is...you never shoot with someone in the line of fire. I know that, Otto. The first rule of the trapper is never to shoot at all unless you absolutely must. Now, what's that supposed to prove? The snake was a krait. It was directly over Anna's head. You know that if one of those things hit you, your ticket is punched out for good. I saw the krait. And so did Anna. 'It was too high up to strike. So, you're not a hero, Stanton.' 'You've just wasted a bullet.' You no longer amuse me. I'm not here to amuse you, Otto. The twin brother of that one got my best tracker from Bengal last year. It was not a very pretty sight. - Thanks, Harry. I'd-- - 'Twan.' Twan. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Yeah, twan. Twan,he goes to shoot big horn. - This is no time for trophies. - Let him go, Harry. [intense music] [gunshot] [grunting] Harry, don't. It has to be the shoulder shot. [gunshot] [dramatic music] Congratulations, Otto. A perfect shoulder shot. It's quite a trophy. - Twan,big magic. - No, leave it there. [Talib] 'You not take it?' I said leave it there. Come on, let's get moving. Otto, I.. [gunshot] [instrumental music] [music continues] This's Sakai God shrine, twan. This enchantress country. [water gurgling] A drink to the Sakai Gods. Looks like a good place to make camp, doesn't it? Well, why waste time? There is still some daylight remaining. - No, I think we're all tired. - What you mean is, I'm tired. Save your pity, Stanton. I'll never feel it, I'll never accept it. [Harry] 'Why don't you say what you mean?' You think I'm finished. I'm all through. You think that any man who needs two shots to make a kill doesn't deserve to be called a hunter. It happens. Anybody can miss. Look, I'm no judge and jury. If you wanna decide that you're through hunting 'that's up to you.' Can't get a trapper to understand. Talib, uh, make a circle of small fires. [Talib speaking in foreign language] [dramatic music] [water gurgling] [music continues] - I want to talk to you, Harry. - So, go ahead, talk. - About Otto. - What about Otto? No man was ever less afraid of dying. Or more afraid of growing old. You can't imagine what he looked like to me 'the first time I saw him.' Like, some kind of God. Can't describe it. As if he could tear the whole world apart and.. ...put it back together again if he wanted to. As if he could put me back together. And he did, Harry. He did. Why didn't he ever marry you? He was 35 years old when I was born. He felt that they might come in and stay with him out of pity. - And, uh, has that day come? - You don't pity a God. No matter what happens to him, you pay your respects. Yeah, but how long do you keep on paying? You'd never tolerate that kind of arrangement, would you? Are you serious? I'd break your neck. It's an American tradition I shall never understand. The scarlet letter's pinned on sinful women by sinful men. And you put chastity, which is not important before fidelity...which is. No, you're wrong about that, Anna. We can consider them both, important. But I wouldn't judge you now anymore than I judged Otto, a little while ago. I simply asked you a question. How long do you keep on paying? I don't know. [dramatic music] Well, we'll just leave it like that for now, huh. [music continues] [water splashing] [speaking in foreign language] I'm afraid that's all I learnt how to say in your language. Come in. [water splashing] Excuse, please, ma'am sahib. I didn't know, you spoke English, Chep. - Some speak. Talib teach. - Ah. - I not know, please. - What do you want to know? Who give you marry cloth, please? I'm afraid I don't understand. This marry cloth. Man give woman belong him. Who man you belong, please? 'One man?' 'Two man?' Hunter man? Trapper man? 'Who your man?' I.. No man has given me marry cloth, Chep. 'Oh.' - Enchantress, twan? - The glasses, Talib. She's up there. This is beautiful. And now you know why men climb mountains. I'll take Talib with me. The rest of you stay here. [speaking in foreign language] Now, what, Talib? She won't. She thinks she must stay with the man she love. Oh, that's very sweet. You tell her we'd be right back. [speaking in foreign language] Now, what's he trying to prove? I wonder if he has to prove anything. [dramatic music] [indistinct] - You speak English? - No enchantress. No nothing. A cave. How about that, that devil's holed up in a cave. Now, if we can only find the other entrance, you stay here. It's inside the mountain. [music continues] Here are her tracks. She's in there, alright. [Harry] 'No wonder she's never been captured.' Now, what? First, I stretch a net across the back door up there. Then, I pay a visit here, to the lady with an invitation to zoo. I suppose she just takes your hand and goes like a baby. Well, uh, I hope to persuade her with an old American hot foot. You know, fire on the end of a stick. Come on, let's go. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - What are you doing? - Just lending a hand. - Otto, don't. - Why not, Anna? Because it's too dangerous. You know nothing. You forget I have to prove something. Stanton may not. But I do. Otto, I never knew you could do a foolish thing in your life. Don't do this. It's not only foolish, it's stupid. That's enough. I had a talent for killing once. Now, it's gone. You know that. I know it. Abbot, the hunter, is finished. What of Abbot the man, my dear? Harry! Harry! Otto's gone into the cave. Stay with the net. - Why didn't you stop him? - I tried, Harry. I tried. [cheetah growling] [male screaming] Take it easy. Stop the bleeding, he'll be alright. You're ready, Talib? Ready, twan. That would have been a stupid way of dying. Without proving anything. [intense music] [music continues] [cheetah snarling] Back. [snarling continues] Come on, you.. Yah! [snarling continues] 'Back up.' 'Back up.' [snarling continues] [snarling continues] Back. [intense music] [foreign language] [foreign language] [foreign language] - [foreign language] - Her feet. Tie her feet. - 'Use the pole' - '[foreign language]' [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] 'Tie her feet' [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Never mind, do it. Use the poles. 'Just have the men loop tie her feet.' And try to lower down in the neck. Yes, twan. [speaking in foreign language] Twan. I'd like to say you a thing. We have the enchantress. I think now you go away. But you come back someday, maybe. Maybe. Right now, I've gotta get this baby down the mountain on a ship, and off to some man in a zoo. And that's a long way off. Oh, I think. You not need your boy, Talib, no more. Uh, Talib. Here. It's little more natural. - For me, twan? - For you. - Talib, you're something else. - It's a deal. It's a deal. [cheetah snarling] [pleasant music] How many oceans have we crossed together, my dear? How many days and nights have we shared? And I think we begun to run out of.. ...world, to see and things to do. Otto, I.. It was my last hunt, Anna. From now on, I shall sit at my desk and write my memoirs. - You won't die at a desk. - No? Well, then tell me... how will I die? The way you've always meant to. You'll keep on killing until you're killed. My dear, we know one another pretty well, don't we? Oh, no, no. Why the tears? Because nothing can be forever. Because in the end we can believe only what we see in here. And holding our hands. Even gods die. Would a god kiss away your tears? Now, you see, I'm just a man after all. But you've been more than a man, Otto. Much more. Oh, does that mean that I've suddenly become less? Anna. We've used up a lot of the world. But I'm sure there's still some of it we can share. [dramatic music] I'm all through, Harry. It's finished between Otto and me. Oh. Did he know that? I've never been very good at telling Otto anything. He always told me everything. I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want to understand. - But it doesn't matter now. - I don't think that's true. Now, I remember, back in the jungle 'you told me that you looked on Otto as some sort of a god.' You sure you're not tryin' to find another to take his place? Because if you are, it'll be with the wrong man. 'Now, there was a time when you needed Otto desperately.' 'He was there.' Don't you think he'll need you now just as much? Even more. Otto has never needed anyone except himself. 'Oh, now, come on.' You stopped me from shooting at the rhino. To protect his pride. You tried to stop him from going into the cave. To save his life. He needs you, Anna. You know that. I guess I made a mistake. I thought you'd understand. I'm just trying to make you see that there is more to this. More than just you and me. There's still you and Otto, and what you've been to each other. You are not protecting Otto. You just can't stand the idea of not being number one. 'That's it. Isn't it?' Tell me, Harry. How many women have there been in your life? - Two, ten, twenty? - What's the difference? - None of them was you. - Harry, I need you. - I want you. - You belong with Otto. No. - I'm no god, Anna. - I know that, darling. [pleasant music] [train chugging] [speaking in foreign language] Ah, we'll be there in 30 minutes. [speaking in foreign language] Strange things happen on a shikar.Don't they, Anna? The man who caught the enchantress. They'll cast you in bronze for that in your country, Stanton. Schelling will welcome you with a big brass band. Oh, come on, Otto It's just another cat. Oh, just another cat. How modest. How meek of you, Harry Stanton. Otto, please. Well, another 28 minutes. But it seems our friend prefers the company of animals. I'm sorry. Oh, you have nothing to be sorry about, my dear. We started something and he finished it. It was a foolish thing we did. No, no, you will see in a few days, a week next month, the American will take his place amongst all the others. Just a man without a face. You didn't listen to me on the boat. There was a time you were my life. I lived in a world that you made for me. 'But'.. I shall always have a great respect for you, Otto. But you love me, Anna. You always have. I used the word respect. - Are you feeling pity? - 'I know you're hurt.' I wish it could have been some other way. But you can't stay the same forever, Otto. We change. All of us. We grow up. I'm sorry, that's all I can say. I'm sorry that I hurt you. And it is only pity you have to offer. - Call it that way if you want-- - Now, listen, my dear. Alright. Just because he made love to you it doesn't mean that he loves you now. You know what Mr. Harry Stanton is. He's a trapper. The minute a trapper has made his capture he loses interest. You hadn't thought of that. To him you are just another enchantress. He doesn't need you anymore. What of the hunter, Otto? Is the hunter only satisfied when he makes of his prey a thing to possess? A lifeless thing? A trophy? Yours is the choice, Anna. The hunter.. ...or the trapper. Load, aim, fire. Too bad. Everything isn't that simple. [intense music] [tiger roaring] Hello, baby. Now, just take it easy, baby. In just a little while you'll have all the room you want and everything you want to eat. I see your moment of triumph approaches. Well, I guess this is as good as time as any other. A good time for what, Stanton? Thank you for taking me through the jungle. - For helping with the cats. - Thank you for nothing. I was nothing but a glorified bush guide and you know it. I'm sorry you feel that way about it, Abbot. Anything can happen on a shikar. You said so yourself. Some things you plan, some things you don't. That's the way it was with Anna and me. There's nothing I don't know about Anna. And the shikar isn't over yet. [tiger roaring] Is that all it takes? Just one? It's a mistake I think we both be better off to forget. Unless you're sure. You better stay down. [dramatic music] [tiger roaring] Now, just what is that supposed to prove? [intense music] [tiger snarling] Stanton? You had two shots at the rhino. If you're going to try this you better make the first one good. What was it you said about the law of the jungle? Oh, yes. "Survival." Wasn't it? 'That's right, Mr. Trapper.' Well, lets test your theory. [intense music] Survive. [tiger roaring] There. That should even the odds, if you can reach it. [cheetah snarling] [snarling continues] [band music] [speaking in foreign language] Dr. Schelling, if you don't mind, please, in English. Yes, yes. Of course. Ladies and gentlemen, such a moment the world has never known. In a moment, Mr. Stanton and Mr. Abbot will come up here to participate in the glory. Our zoo is proud to receive the enchantress. [crowd murmuring] Ladies and gentlemen, you will see the enchantress.' [cheetah roaring] [people screaming] [dramatic music] Stanton, this is terrible-- We've gotta find that cat and we've gotta find it fast. She's gonna kill anybody before her. But the gun? Must you use it? She's very valuable. Just get to a telephone and notify the police. The whole city's got to be warned immediately. Yes, but-- [Stanton] 'Look, just go.' - Anna, are you coming? - He needs our help. Stanton caught the animal. It's his responsibility. - Are you coming? - No. [dramatic music] [humming] [cheetah roaring] [screaming] Yeah? Yeah. Thank you, sir. Sehr. Yeah. Auf Wiedersehn. Every radio and television station is broadcasting the warning. There's nothing else to do now but wait. I'm to give you every cooperation. It shouldn't be long before someone finds the animal. I hope you're right, lieutenant. But she can hide where it's impossible to hide. Forget about that. You'll never stop over that. [intense music] [siren wailing] Yeah, yeah. Thank you, sir. [speaking in foreign language] I am puzzled as to how such an animal could enter into an apartment building? How many men do you have at your disposal? 20, I can get you 1000, if you require. 20 should do it. If their half is good as a bunch of Sakai beaters. [siren wailing] [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] Get a loudspeaker. [speaking in foreign language] Listen, you tell these people to keep their doors and windows closed. First tell them to throw down tin cans, pots, pans. Anything that will make a noise. [speaking in foreign language] A cat on a rampage will always look for a height. We're gonna try to help this one. If we get her cornered on that roof we might get a clear shot. Start in the basement and work your way up. Tell the men to make a lot of noise. They can shout, scream, whistle. Anything. Just keep it up. - Where's the fire escape? - Fire escape's this way. You get your men started. We'll be on the roof you drive her up to us. [shouting] It's on the second floor, Harry. Get started. We'll do the shootin'. Come with me. [speaking in foreign language] [intense music] Even the enchantress can't get through a closed door. [cheetah snarling] [gunshot] Abbot. Watch it! You almost got me instead of the cat. What made you think I was aiming at the cat? I should have killed you when I had the chance. 'On the train.' The train? Where'd she go? [Anna] 'I don't know.' [male on loudspeaker] 'Mr. Stanton.' Can you hear me, Mr. Stanton? 'We heard a shot.' 'Have you killed the animal?' 'Do you require assistance?' Stay where you are. [intense music] You just cover me. [Abbot] 'You missed, Stanton.' Why not that the girl have a shot of it. 'She's better than both of us.' You didn't miss. I think I nicked her. She's gonna be twice as hard to get now. [Abbot] 'Stanton.' 'If you hadn't interfered, if you'd left me in that cave.' Then none of this would have happened, would it? 'Had to die or win.' It's now, Stanton. You may take your pick. The enchantress or me. [intense music] [cheetah snarling] Stanton, the animal or me? You stay here. [gunshot] What now, Mr. Trapper? [gunshot] [gunshot] [firing continues] I've more than two shots this time, Stanton. Otto, watch out behind you! [screaming] Anna, shoot! [gunshot] [slow music] [Anna] 'It had to end this way.' It ended with Otto. [music continues] [pleasant music] Uh, Stanton. Stanton, such news. Fantastic. Fantastic. From Sumatra I've just heard that they have located another. If not bigger. At least as big. You will go. It will be such great publicity-- Whoa! Wai-wait a minute. What is it that so fantastic? They have located another enchantress. You must go. You will go? Won't you? We'll talk about it tomorrow, huh? Tomorrow? Very well. Tomorrow. Very early tomorrow. Not too early tomorrow. Talib gave you this. He called it, uh, a marry cloth. He said that I should give it to my woman if I ever found her. What about all the others, Harry? All the other men in my life? To hell with all the others. There weren't any other men. Before you, it was only Otto. Give me the marry cloth. [pleasant music]
