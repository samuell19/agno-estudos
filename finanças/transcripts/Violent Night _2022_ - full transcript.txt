He didn't. I am so sorry. This year has been weird. I never got to tell Santa what I wanted for Christmas. Oh, honey. Come here. You know what? You go put your pj's on, and I will be two minutes. Yes! Okay... Yes. Yes! Because you have been so good to me and Mommy this year, we decided that you could have one gift... early! Really? What is it? That is a very special walkie-talkie.

Now, the only thing is, he might not have time to answer you. He's delivering a lot of presents tonight. Mm-hmm. But he'll hear everything you want to say to him. Hello, Santa? This is Trudy Lightstone. I hope you're having a nice night. Mm. It's really cold tonight, so don't forget your mittens. So, I wanted to tell you, Santa, I was extra good this year, so I wrote a big list for you with all the stuff I wanted. But then... then I realized I don't need any of that. I really only want one present for Christmas. I want Mommy and Daddy to make up so we can be a family again. Okay. Good night, Santa. Good night, Mr. Bunny. Which one of you did that? You can't go two seconds without crapping on the roof like a bunch of pigeons? So unprofessional. You know, Rudolph will never do this crap. Hmm. Mmm. Mmm, mmm. Homemade. Mmm. Ugh. Skim. Oh, yeah.

And you should've taken her yesterday, like you do every Christmas, but we didn't even hear from you. Mom put me on a special project. - It's complicated. - But it's not, because it keeps happening over and over. -Your mother forcing herself between us. -You're right. What if we could give Trudy her Christmas wish? You're trying to win me back with a romantic weekend at your mother's? What if things really changed this time? We got out from under my mother's thumb. We'll walk away. From the company, the family. Tonight. What are you up to? Let's go. We need to get you out of here. Mommy, where are you going? - She's going for the panic room! - What? - Yes. Go, Bertrude. - Without us? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. There isn't room for all of us. She can fit at least two of us. Mom, take me. - Mom! - Oh. Yeah. M-Mom, can Bert come, too? Okay. Move it or lose it, son. - Move it! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're supposed to protect us. We protect the primary asset. Who the hell are you? You can call me Mr. Scrooge. Hilarious. Get him. Bah humbug, motherfucker. Hey. Step aside. Tinsel, Peppermint, sweep upstairs.

Oh, come on. Not now. Not now. Fuck! Fuck! Mistletoe, gingerbread. Hey! Oh. Oh. Hi. You got me. I don't want any trouble, okay? Downstairs. Now. Look, mister, I don't want to get involved. I just... I just have a job to do. Okay? That's it. I'm just gonna take my bag, and I'm just gonna scooch up that chimney. Enough talk. Let's go. You don't want to do this. What? This? Now, move! Are you deaf?

Do you have any idea who you're fucking with? I know exactly who I'm fucking with. Oh, wait, wait. Did you actually think that I spent months planning a complex break-in to the most secure private residence in the country and I didn't know who lived here? Well, you're wrong. 'Cause your staff are dead. Your security are dead. Now, sit down and shut the fuck up! Oh, fuck. We planned it. It's all right. It'll be solved in a couple minutes. Better be solved. So much like a scene from my movie Dark Ransom. Oh, my God. If they didn't have guns, I could take out three, maybe four of them. Try all of them. Ew, Mom. Yuck. If you'd really done your research, you'd know that my brother Rory was kidnapped in the '70s. But my father never called the police. Dad sent in our own private extraction team, and Rory was home safe and sound a week later. And the kidnappers were never found. If you get me. I know. I know all about your extraction team that you affectionately call "the Kill Squad" behind closed doors. I also know that they're on their way and how long it's gonna take 'em to get here. I even know their credit ratings and their dick sizes. If you get me. Then you should also know you're already dead. We don't do ransoms. Again, I know. I know. See, I know a lot, Gertrude. I really do. Like the fact that you have 300 million in U.S. dollars sitting in your personal vault downstairs. - The fuck? - That's right. 300 million that the U.S. government gave Lightstone to quietly distribute in the Middle East to all the worst people, to grease the wheels and keep that sweet oil flowing. 300 million that... oops... Disappeared in the fog of war. Except it didn't really disappear, did it, Gerty? 'Cause you stole it. Did you know about this? Man, this family. This moneygrubbing family. Clinging desperately to your wealth, when your poor employees don't even have enough coal to keep Tiny Tim warm. What is it with you and all this Christmas shit? Talk all you want. You'll never get in the vault. Oh, oh, oh, because when you-you hit the panic button, it reset the combination? I keep telling you, I know. This is what breaking into a vault has turned into? Remember when you just had to drill holes and blow shit up? I don't know, maybe I'm getting old, but there was something romantic about that. Boss, you copy? I'm kind of busy here.

I hope I'm not bothering you. Daddy said you were very busy tonight. I'm... I'm on a break. Who-who am I speaking to? My name is Trudy Lightstone, and I've been very good this year. Trudy... Trudy Lightstone. Yeah, Trudy. You're on my nice list. You've been a very good girl this year. Where are you now, Trudy? I'm in a big room with all my relatives. There's two bad men with guns watching us. Oh, no. Six left. Are you gonna help us, Santa? Yeah. Of course I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna... I'm gonna get you out of there. Take all these bad guys on my naughty list... I'm gonna take a lump of coal, each and every one of them, and shove it straight up... The ass. Well, I mean, come on, sweetie. We want to keep you on the nice list, you know. Sorry. Can I say "butthole," then? I mean, it's borderline. How about "anus"? Technically, yes, uh, "anus" is the tech... Okay, look, uh, Tru... uh, Trudy. I got to call for help, and the phone lines are down. You probably know this house better than anybody. You got any suggestions? I have an idea. All right, you're telling me there's a goddamn Santa Claus running around here? Okay, well, he looks jolly as fuck, but who the hell is he? There's no Santa listed on the employee manifest. Yeah, there's more. Frosty hasn't checked in. I can't reach him. All right, keep trying. All right, it's official. We got a gopher on the loose, and he's dangerous. Watch your backs. Al? Al? Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Frosty, what's your status? Frosty, sound off. Uh, Frosty? Is-is that, uh... is that the naughty guy I met in the basement? Your-your friend is dead. Uh, he got a star in his face, then his head caught on fire. It's a long story. Oh. Is this... is this our Santy? Is this our... our Santy Claus? Yeah, it is. To whom am I speaking? Well, for tonight, I'm Mr. Scrooge. Now, what is it that you want exactly, Santa? I want you to put down your weapons, I want you to let this family go, and then I want to find my reindeer, and I want to continue delivering my presents. Are you fucking with me? All right, who the hell are you really, huh? Some security guard who's watched too many action flicks? Some loser ex-cop stuck in a mall playing dress-up with fat kids pissing on your lap? Stop me when I get it right. It's a little more complicated than that. Not to me, it's not. 'Cause I want to make it my personal mission, my holiday to-do list, to find you and to end you and to wipe my ass with you and this whole fucking holiday. That's what I want for Christmas, Santa. That is a terrible thing to want for Christmas. But maybe you and I should discuss that in person. Santa Claus is coming to town. Shit. All right, who did you hire to play Santa at your Christmas party, huh? I said, who's playing Santa at your fucked-up Christmas party? I didn't hire a Santa. I never have a Santa. It's tacky. So, who is he? ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride... ♪ Huh? Who is he? Somebody better start talking, or I'm gonna bash her brains in with this... Damn, Gertrude. You really got a thing for nutcrackers, huh? So, I'm gonna torture everyone in your family until you tell me who's running around your mansion playing Santa and fucking with my shit. And who should I pick first? Should I go by age? Shh. Or should I go by IQ? Pick Jason. He's my mom's favorite. - Yep. Him. - The one in the sweater. All right. Jason Lightstone it is. - The number one son. - No. Wait, wait, wait. No, we don't need... We don't need to do that. No, it's okay. No. No, no, no. We don't need to do this. No. No, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't. - No, don't... Put it... - Don't... No. - - No, no, no, no. No, no. - Give me this fucking... I'm telling you, no one hired a Santa. All right, all right, all right. You're right. You're right. Let's stop it. Let's stop it. What are we doing here? Come on. What are we, amateurs? We're half-assing this. Come on. It's not called a finger cracker. Okay, Candy Cane. Stick one of his bozaks in there. I'm not touching his balls. What, are you a princess all of a sudden? I've seen you scoop out brains before. You want me to scoop his brains out, I'll scoop his brains out right now, but I'm not touching his junk. I don't care who does it. I better be looking at flat balls, like, in three seconds. I'll do it. Krampus. Perfect. Oh, not that guy. Not that guy. That's what I love about sociopaths. Always up for trying new things. You don't need to do this, okay? No, it's all right. Um... Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Put your nuts in. Yummy, yummy. Stop hurting my daddy... or Santa will get mad. Ah, what a cutie. So, what do we know about Santa, little one? She doesn't know anything about Santa. He wasn't asking you. She's playing make-believe. She's pretending to talk to Santa. It's not pretend. Santa's my friend, and he said he's going to save us. No. - And beat you up. - Oh, is he? I bet he'd come out of hiding if you asked him to, huh? What do you say you come with me -and we play a little game with him, huh? -No, no, no. Trudy, come on. Tell him the truth now. - You aren't talking to Santa. - Yes, I am. No, you're not. Come on, now. -Yes, I am. -Damn it, Trudy, Santa isn't real! I'm sorry, honey. Santa's just a thing adults tell kids to make them feel better, okay? Your mommy and I give you the presents, and we say they're from Santa. He's not coming to save us. He doesn't exist. It's all made-up. - Really? - Aw. What a way to find out that there's no Santa. Hey, let's come back Easter and ruin the Easter Bunny for her, too, huh? - Trudy! - Come back here! - Stop her! - Trudy! -Hey! You idiots, stay at your posts. Trudy! I'll find this little brat. Okay. Santa. Santa. Santa! This is Trudy. Are you okay, Santa? Hi. Hey. Are you okay? I'm good. Uh... I was just wrapping something up. I ran away and hid in the attic. Okay. If you're safe... uh, just stay there and, uh, stay quiet, all right? Okay. I can set up booby traps, like in Home Alone. Okay, I don't know what that means, but, uh, yeah, do that. Just do it quietly. Are you really Santa? Of course I am, sweetheart. My daddy says there isn't any Santa. He says parents just tell their kids that Santa's real to make them feel better. He said they give us presents and say they're from Santa. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of parents say that. But I still bring presents to kids that need me. Kids who really believe. How do you know who really needs you? Christmas magic. I'm not really sure how it works. But, uh... I remember, um... when Trudy Lightstone wrote to me. She must have been about six years old, and she said that she felt lonely sometimes. She missed having a best friend. And so I brought her a beautiful little stuffed rabbit. Mr. Bunny. And then I remember the next year, and you said you had this amazing dream and that, afterwards, all you wanted to do was... To fly! To fly. To fly. I mean, Santa might have some magic, but... making a little girl fly? But giving you a kite, floating just beneath the clouds, well, it's about as good as it gets. I knew it. I knew you were real, Santa. Don't be too hard on your parents, all right? Grown-ups have a hard time believing things. Can you use your Christmas magic to make them love each other again? I wish I had that kind of power. Mrs. Claus and I have been going on year, uh, 1,100, and... Grown-up relationships are complicated. It takes work. A lot of work. Do you still love her? Yeah, I do. And sometimes, even if you want to make somebody happy... the magic just goes away. Hey. I've got an idea. This will be fun. Why don't you guys open your presents? I want to see what you rich assholes get each other. And some of you might not make it till tomorrow morning, so this could be your only chance. Come on. Where's the Christmas spirit? Uh... Gertrude, uh, I got you something pretty special. Did you hear that, Gertrude? He got you something amazing. Oh, what could it be? Oh, my God, this is exciting. Mom. Can I call you Mom? Mrs. Lightstone. Okay, so in the business, they call this... a pitch deck. - Pitch deck. - Yeah. It's called Explosive Force. Starring me. And if you look in the back, there are the financial numbers. I'm kind of a big deal in Asia. Parts of Asia, at least. We were in parts of Asia once, and, like, we couldn't even go to a restaurant. Ah, what is there a better gift than... gift of a golden opportunity? Oh, no. Granny doesn't like it. Mother, I got you something really special. It's a sentimental photo of the day I was born. I remember. I was there. She doesn't give a shit. Swing and miss again! This is so fun. Mommy, how about another one? I got you a lot of good things. - I'll grab one. - Alva, Alva, sit down. You've already given me one. It's... It's Jason's turn. Uh... I th... I-I think I left it in the car. No, I-I saw you put one under the tree earlier. - No. It's in the... - Yeah, I did. I could've sworn. You know what, it's, uh... Y-You don't... you don't... you don't... you... It's this one, right? Yeah, I got you, bro. Come on. Thank you. It's my favorite whiskey. You can skip the note. Thank you, Jason. What's the card say? I think I'll just keep that between Jason and I. No one really needs to know. Right, Jason? Right. Did you ever have a mommy and daddy? Yeah, of course I had a mommy and daddy. I wasn't... I wasn't always Santa Claus. I had a life before this. A long, long, long time ago. They used to call me, uh... Nicomund. Nicomund the Red. You had a different job then? Yeah, you could say that. I was a warrior. A raider. A thief. And if somebody got in my way, me and Skullcrusher would... Who's Skullcrusher? Skullcrusher's my, uh... my hammer. My favorite hammer. I was a surgeon with that thing. Used to be able to take three heads, line 'em up... But why? What? Why'd you do those things? Because I was mean. And I was greedy. And I wanted gold, jewels. Yeah, I mean, if there was a naughty list back then, I'd be top dog. Well, maybe... What? Maybe all those bad things you used to do... maybe you can use them to do good things instead. To help. What do you mean? Mr. Bunny, he wasn't just a toy. That night, you gave me what I wished for. A best friend. 'Cause you're good and kind. And you mean more than just the presents you bring. That's why I believe in you, Santa. That's why I believe. Thank you. You stay hidden, Trudy, till I come get you. Stay safe. All right, we got satellite confirmation. Extraction team's on the go. 30 minutes. We're on schedule. Everything's good. All right, fellas. Look alive, look alive. You all know the plan, and I like my operations like I like to fuck: hard and fast with minimal cleanup. Now, some idiot gets in your way, what do you do? Fuck their shit up right! Damn right. Time to lube up. Let's go, motherfuckers! Let's go! This fucking family. Ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Traitor. I got him in the east wing. All right, we're on our way. Hold him. Step aside. Now, how did this tired, old, fat piece of shit get the drop on us? I don't know. He's not even armed. This bag is the only thing he had on him. What's in there? Can't see anything. Here, give it to me. What kind of moron... carries a chess set with him? What the fuck? Doesn't make any sense. Look at all this shit. So, you're gonna tell us what's the gimmick with the bag? It's magic. You put your hand in, out comes a present. I don't really understand how it works, either. So, you're Mr. Scrooge. That's right. But who are you? Weihnachtsmann. Julenissen. Shèngdàn Laorén. Babbo Natale, Père Noel, Kris Kringle. Jolly old Saint Nick. People call me a lot of things. Ha, ha, ha. Very funny. Or should I say, "Ho, ho, ho"? If you're Santa, where's your reindeer? They were on the roof until that guy I turned into an ice kebab just... You don't believe me? Go check. Prancer left a tasty log up there. This fucking guy. You don't think... Now, I know you're an idiot, but don't be an idiot out loud. Come on, he's just in Santy Claus with a fucking trick bag. Oh, no! That bag was full of kids' dreams! Oh, come on. Everybody knows that Christmas dreams are bullshit. My father used to make a big deal out of it every Christmas. Every freaking Christmas with the presents and the candy and the decorations and the Christmas caroling and all that bullshit. And then when I was... I don't know, ten, 11, he got laid off, and that Christmas, couldn't even afford a tree. No Christmas dinner, no gifts. Nothing, nada, culo, dick. But our neighbors... our neighbors, oh, they had it all. I could see all that yuletide cheer through their window mocking me. So Christmas Eve rolls around, and... I waited for everybody to go to bed. And then I snuck in there to take it all. Only problem was that the gramps got up to take a piss and the two of us scared the shit out of each other. And, um, he fell down the stairs and-and broke his neck, and he died in the hospital. Everybody thought that I did it, and every time I tried to tell them, I tried to tell them that... Anyway, maybe I did do it. Maybe I did push him. Poor old fucker. So, you see, Christmas ruined my life. Okay? But you know what? It set me on the path and made me the great man that I am today. I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. But I do gifts. I do Christmas cheer. I don't get involved in people's lives. Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, maybe you fucking should! Um, how did he know your name? Oh, Bjorn. What's your excuse? Huh? Didn't I get you that Huffy bike you wanted back in '82? One you wrote me 50 times about! What about you, Kira? Well, you made your brother eat worms. That's naughty! Okay, how does he know about my bike? It's a lucky guess, like: "Hey, do you like big tits?" Come on, every kid wants a fucking bike. -You're gonna tell me who you work for... -Oh, Christ. No. Then you've got five seconds to tell me who you really are. Five, four, three, two... I'm Santa Claus! Well, not anymore. Is it snowing? Is he doing this with Santa magic? Let it snow! It's not snow. It's Styrofoam. I told you this guy's a big phony. Where'd he go? He went up the chimney. - I saw it. - I don't know, he had a rig or some pulley system - that just yanked him up. - You can't fit up there. - It's impossible. - Oh, you see one weird thing, and then you think you're in a fairy tale? Incoming. We've got sleigh bells approaching. Oh, my God. It's his reindeer. It's the extraction team. Pull yourselves together! And that is the sound of my Kill Squad. Oh, you're fizzity-fucked now. Huh? What are you gonna do? You little elf bitch. Fu... Bertie. Hashtag "blessed." Yeah! Parkour. Kill him, babe! Oh! Morgan's gonna save us. Jean-Claude Van Dipshit just ditched us, sweetie. Hold your fire. Barrel roll! Easy, easy. - Yeah! - Easy. Identify yourself. I'm one of the hostages. Morgan Steel, the actor. Played a lot of soldiers in my career. Can I just say, thank you for your service. Semper fi. What's the situation inside? Bunch of ex-military guys, but I got to warn you, they know you're coming. I think they're ready for you. They better be. We're on a tight schedule. Shit. Oh, f... - All right, let's move out. - Let's move out. Come on. You got to be kidding me. Hey, Thorp, you're ten minutes late. What kept you? Looks to me like your net's got a hole in it. Or are you just letting your hostages out for some exercise? No, no, no. We got a wild gopher running around complicating shit and causing problems. Who? Lightstone security? Nah, I don't think so. Some intruder dressed as Santa. But I'm telling you, I'm telling you, there's something weird about him. Might be the real Santa. - The fuck did she just say? - Nothing, nothing. She's joking. My squad will take care of it. Beta Team, go find this asshole. Go. Now, let's unwrap our present, shall we? All right, you heard the man. Time to kill Santa. I've got him. He's on the roof. Roger that. I got eyes on him. Right, Sugarplum. Hit that button. Here we go. Our skeleton key. The "open" magic stick. This better fucking work. I'm flushing my career for this, my reputation. Yeah, well, then you can buy yourself a new rep. As a kid, I loved unwrapping Christmas presents so much that my mom would wrap empty boxes for me. I didn't care that nothing was inside. Is this a fucking joke? No. You said it would fucking be here! I'm telling you, my intel was rock solid. I had guys on the inside. 300 million in cash was delivered here yesterday to this fucking mansion. Somebody must've intercepted it. Son of a bitch. Oh, shit. Santa, you okay? Santa. A bunch of new bad guys showed up. They're on the naughty list. They got their gadgets and their gizmos on them. I'm sorry. I think this is it, kid. No, no, don't say that. The naughty list... just grows and grows. He's in that structure. Body cams on. Don't give up. You make a wish this time, Santa. Just this once. If you could have anything in this world, what would it be? I wish I could see Mrs. Claus again, tell her how much I love her. Then you make that wish come true. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. No, no. Oh, God. No. You said these guys, they're naughty. And what do you do to the naughty ones? I give them a lump of coal. Yeah. Give them their lumps. Take that coal and shove it straight up their... - Anuses. - Yeah! They're right outside. Santa's gonna eat through these guys like a plate full of cookies. Move, move. Hey, lock it up. Lights down. Stay at my back. All right, we got this, boys. All right, where the fuck is my money?! Where's the money?! All right, I've been a sweetheart up to now. But that's all over. No more fucking games! Where's the money? Or I will shoot every last one of you and enjoy it. - It's in the vault. - I just looked in the vault. Had the money been in there, I'd have a different expression on my face. Impossible. Takes days to get into that thing. Not if we have the key, Mrs. Lightstone. Thorp. You can't trust anyone these days. I'm not sure how, but you or one of your shithead kids moved the money. And this upsets me. It upsets me in a way that makes me want to just randomly shoot at people. Hold on. Just...

Yeah, I did it. - I moved the money. - No, d-don't-don't be an idiot. - What? - The money's our only leverage. Well, my wife has a fucking gun to her head, so... Yeah, how did you find out that we were coming, huh? I didn't. I was stealing it. - Yeah, coincidence. - Oh, my God. I was planning to take the money and leave with my wife and daughter tonight and never come back here. Oh, and then my mom would, uh, read the note with her whiskey in the morning and know what I had done. For years, I have been telling you to stop caring about your mother's fucking money! And you think the solution was to steal a bunch of it. Well, it... yeah, it does sound stupid when you say it like that. How can you do this right now? It's disgusting. After all that Mother has given us? Come on, Alva. Everything she ever gave you, she made damn sure we knew she had the power to take right back. I have spent years groveling to you. In the meanwhile, I was destroying the only good thing in my life. What are we doing here, huh? Family therapy or doing a heist? - Yeah, enough of this sharing bullshit. - All right. Where'd you put it? Look at this little idiot. Oh, no. What? - The bad guys found me. - Okay. I'm coming. You know, booby traps don't work unless you hide them. You little moron. Jesus! Shit! Help me! Help me! Help! You'll be f... You'll be fine. Sit tight. I'll be back in a sec. Right after I kill this little piece of shit! You little fucking brat. You're dead! You're so fucking dead! Fucking piece of shit. You little... Incoming! Son of a fucking... Fuck. I got you now, kid. Yeah? Heads up. That's all you got? You fucking... Enough of this shit. Santa! Hi, Trudy. Hi. I made booby traps like in the movie. It was so funny. Ho, ho, ho. Trudy, I want you to, uh... just do me a favor. Just turn around and close your eyes.

When your grandfather told me I'd never run the company because a girl doesn't have what it takes, I had to snatch the reins away from him. But the point is, a Lightstone takes what's theirs. I'm proud of you, son. All right, where the hell is it? The money's hidden inside. And the Three Wise Men presented him with gifts of frankincense, myrrh... and cold hard cash. Load it up, boys. All right, we're securing the money. Kill the hostages and meet us outside. What? No. Mom. It's fine, Bert. Everything's fine. Okay. Everybody, get up. It's time for a murder. Come on. Come on. You don't want to kill us. You really don't. Oh, yes, I do. I really, really, really do. And I'm gonna start with you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You got to kill Aunt Linda first. What the hell, Bert? You want to squeeze in being a little shit before you die, Bertrude? - I say shoot him first. - What? Wait. No, no, no. Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him first. And don't you call him a little shit, you gold-digging bitch. Okay. I changed my mind. -Shoot the alcoholic bitch first. -Don't call my mom - an alcoholic bitch. - Your mom's an alcoholic. - I'm sorry. - You're a gold-digging bitch. Oh, I'm a gold-digger, when I have a whole-ass career? You're not even part of the fucking family. - She's an engineer. - You know goddamn well... Shut up! Just like rats in a barrel. Why don't you die with some dignity? Get off of me! Okay, okay. Fuck you! This is for yelling at my child! Creep! That's for slapping me, motherfucker! This is for your dumb fucking hat! Is he... Is he dead? Yeah. Thanks, Linda. Well, it's nice to do something as a family for a change. Oh, shit! I'm gonna... That was for Morgan. He may have been stupid, but he was very, very hot. Oh. Trudy! Mommy! Thank God, baby. Are you okay? I'm okay, Mommy. Okay. This is my friend, Santa. What the fuck? I can't thank you enough, Mister... Claus. But please call me Santa. Mm-hmm. You guys should get out of here. It's dangerous. They took my husband and her grandmother. Anybody know how to work these gizmos? I think so. I used to hunt with my dad. Ow. Copy that. How's that looking? - Yeah, I got it on lockdown. - Heads on a swivel, boys. - Incoming! - Heads up! Oh, oh! Who's shooting? Who's... - Cap, get down! - Watch it! Watch it! Gun 'em down. Mow them all down. -All right, let's get the fuck out of here. -Let's go. - Go where? - Come on, move, you old bat. Get your fucking hands off of me. Oh! Oh, shit. My balls! My fucking balls! Ow, my balls! Why did you shoot me in the ball... Oh, Jesus. Sorry. Don't worry about us, Mr. Claus. We got this. Who is that guy? He said he was Mr. Claus. - Fuck. Trudy. - No, no. She's in the house. She's okay. She's safe. - Oh, thank God. - Yeah. No, no. - Oh... go, go, go, go, go. - No, no, no. Wait, wait. Oh, shit! Ho, ho! Fuck! Fucking die. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah, over here. Over here. Santa! Come on! Yeah. Fuck. You're real? You're... him. You're you. That's what I've been trying to tell you. The real goddamn Santa Claus. This is not your night, pal. Oh, I don't know. I think you're wrong. I think my whole shitty life's built up to this moment. Because when I kill you, this whole goddamn holiday finally ends. Whatever it takes... Christmas dies tonight. Whoa! The last Christmas. Not if you still believe. No! I have no idea what the fuck is going on here. But this ends now. Damn right it does. Trudy, be careful. Santa! Oh, no. Santa. Oh, no. You saved my daughter. No. She saved me. Help him. Please help him. Honey, I don't think there's anything we can do. It's okay. It's okay. It's too late for that. Too late. I'm cold. I haven't felt cold in years. We need to keep him warm. All of the fires are going out. We need to find something to burn. I got an idea. Whoa. No. No, no, no, no. No, Jason, no. Please, Santa. I don't want you to die. Jason, let's slow this down. What are you doing? I've lived longer than any man should ever live. He's pretty much dead. What the hell is happening? - You don't need to burn money. - Okay. More. Yeah. You can't die, Santa. You have to get up. I think I used up all my Christmas magic. Sorry. I'm s... I'm sorry I can't give you what you asked for. Take that. Take that. But you did. Santa, please don't die. Wake up. Wake up. We need to get him close to the fire. Jason. Just wake up. Please. No. Oh, I am so, so sorry. This man... This brave, brave man, whoever he was... He's Santa. The real Santa. He is. And I still believe in him. I'll always believe in you, Santa. I believe in him, too. He saved Trudy. He saved our family. What's realer than that? Then maybe... I believe in him, too. So do I. Oh, shit. I guess... I guess I do, too. Fuck me. I believe, too. Oh, my God. Santa! You... You were dead. Christmas magic. I still don't really understand... how it works. Thank you. I don't know how we can ever repay you. Well, you brought me back from the dead, so we'll call it even. Even? We just burned half a million dollars. - Look, Santa! - Hmm? Look who came. Now you show up, huh? You leave me here to die, come back after all the work's done, huh? You know what? I should make you guys into a stew and feed you to the elves! Yes, Blitzen! Yes, I'm talking to you! You, too, Prancer. You got my sack. My spare... You went home and you got my spare sack? Oh, God, I can't stay mad at you guys. I... Aw. I can't. I can't. Aw. Aw. Hello, beautiful. Skullcrusher! Guess this is goodbye. I got to go. Do you have to? It's Christmas Eve, and there's a lot of... boys and girls on the nice list that want their presents, you know? Thank you. For what? For believing in me. For reminding me that Christmas still matters. And that I still... matter. You gave me my "ho, ho, ho" back. All right. Get out of here. Merry Christmas! Hyah! Now, Dasher!
