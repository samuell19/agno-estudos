[music playing] [bells ringing] Take this to Lieutenant Adronika. [bells] [soft music] Ah, come in. Come in, Anatoly. [phone rings] Yes? Yes, of course. This is the communique I sent you from Washington. Ah. Good. Very good. [suspenseful music] Come, Anatoly. [suspenseful music] Hold this for a moment, will you? [suspenseful music] [paper shredder running] [intense music] [electrical snapping] Pity. The paper shredder is out of order. I'll have to have it fixed in the morning. Safe journey. You will keep us informed from Washington, Anatoly. Certainly, sir. RUSSIAN OFFICIAL: When are you going? Tomorrow afternoon. RUSSIAN OFFICIAL: Oh have a good flight. ANATOLY: Thank you very much. RUSSIAN OFFICIAL: Is your family going with you. ANATOLY: No, not this time. RUSSIAN OFFICIAL: Oh, well. [suspenseful music] [horn honking] [traffic noise] I can do without the dirty looks. I should be there when he asks me. He needs that now more than ever. Everything OK? AGENT (ON RADIO): Yacht and dockside all clear, sir. Tell her he's coming. [bells] Mr. President. [bells] Miss Morton, he's coming aboard. Thank you. [footsteps on carpet] Hi, darling. [jet engine running] CAPTAIN JACKSON (ON INTERCOM): Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Jackson. We have a favorable weather report from Dulles so we will be landing on schedule at 5:45 Washington time. You know, this is really weird. Ah, you and I have been sitting next to each other for two hours in absolute silence. Of course, in that time I haven't really come up with any spectacular plan to meet you. So with no further ado, my name is Ben. OK. Hey, that's all right. Listen, ah rejection, you know, I can live with that. Everything in life is a lesson. But you know, I think, really we're missing one of the rarest of opportunities here. The airplane relationship, it's the best. No past. No future, just the present. Ben Morton. Margaret. Margaret what? Margaret it's none of your business. That's a nice name. Is that French? You don't look like a Margaret. - Sorry. - No, come on. You must have been called something other than Margaret somewhere in your life. Mugsy. Mugsy? That's perfect. I love that. All right. Mugsy, let me tell you a little bit more about this ah airplane relationship. Ah, it's ah it's a non-involvement pact. I mean, all we are is right now. I mean, we've got to make right here and now a peak experience, no pain, all pleasure. Unfortunately reality is pain and pleasure. Who said anything about reality? [music playing] [knocking] RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR: Come in. Do you have any idea what time it is? I'm sorry, sir, but this could be important. It's from a cover operative inside the Kremlin. [suspenseful music] I want this to get to Washington on the next flight. [horn honking] [traffic noise] What's going on? Ah, it's an accident. Can you get around it? Not if you want to get downtown. Why don't you just hang a left at the next intersection? CABBIE: That's not gonna get you downtown, buddy. It'll get me home. Hey, wait a minute here. Look, listen, that hotel that you're goin' to is not gonna give your room away. Besides, I think it'd be much more relaxing just sittin' around at my place than sittin' around in all this traffic. I may be safer sitting in all this traffic. Safe, safe, safe, safe, everyone wants to be so safe. Do you prefer claustrophobia and gas fumes and honking horns to soft music and quiet conversation? Hang a left at the next intersection. [horn honking] MARGARET "MUGSY" EVANS: An old girlfriend? BEN MORTON: No, it's my sister. Hey, Di-- [horn honking] You own this? No, I just rent a piece of it. Oh. Thanks a lot. - Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good night. Thanks. Yeah, I just moved in a couple weeks ago. Oh. Hi. Hi. This is my place here. [keys rattling] [soft music] So Margaret, ah, Mugsy, does my literary taste impress you? Mm, ah, your Gestalt therapy verbatim is impressive but Saturday Night Thrill Girls? I have a thirst for knowledge. Well, I found out something else about you. You're a jogger. Ah, you found me out. Well, you know something about me. You owe me one. I'm a jogger too. Hm, that's what they all say. Really? Some of them do. Ah, are you trying to ply me with liquor? Will it work? My mother always warned me, two drinks and I call a cab. [music playing] [airport noises] [plane tires screech] [intense music] [door clicks] [flute music] [phone dialing] DONNA MORTON (VOICEMAIL): Please wait for the tone, then speak clearly. [beep] BEN MORTON: This is 10B42 reporting back. Mission completed. No return package. That's it. Oh, I love you. That's just in case anyone is really listening. [intense music] Rise and shine. [soft music] [birds chirping] Hey. Hey. Rise and shine. Are you crazy? Come on, you're a jogger, remember? I don't choose to go jogging. You need it. You gotta sweat all of last night's poisons outta your system. I'm not the one who overindulged and passed out. Good, you'll be fresh for joggin' then. Come on. I want you to have some of this, here. Oh. Go on. [birds chirping] Mm. Oh. What is in here? Wheat germ. Here. These'll fit. Hey. Is this standard in all of your airplane relationships? They're my sister's. Sure. [birds chirping] [ocean waves rolling] You run very well. Thanks. Do you ever compete? No, never did. Well, you run really good. Really good. Feel like racing? Oh, I see. No, I'm not much for competing, against my nature. Against your nature? Uh-huh. Competition is why America is what it is today. I rest my case. Hey, listen, come on now. This joggin's no good. Tell ya what. What? Ah, all right. You see that park bench four trees away? Yeah. Race you to the bench. No, you go on. OK, I put my money where my mouth. Please. Ten big ones says I can get to that bench before you do. Listen, I-- I really don't wanna race, OK? Oh, come on big time runner, 10 big ones. You're on. [feet pounding the path] Oh. Ah, ha ha. Pay up. Come on. Oh. Oh. How would you like to unpack your bags? You know that hotel you're goin' to? Absolute pits. You're gonna hate it. I got a spare room at my place. Nobody's living there now. Ah, cheaper than a hotel. It is? Oh, hey. You spent the whole night with me last night. Am I not the perfect gentleman? You passed out. That's what perfect gentlemen do. Well, I-- you know, I've got things to do, you know. What'd you got to do? No questions, remember? You can still do your unquestionable things. I provide room service. Look, I ah I got a very extensive library, a complete physical fitness program. Beats a hotel. [motors running] ED MURPHY: You took the President out last night? That's right. ED MURPHY: Then why in God's name didn't you follow established Secret Service procedure? Well, that's the way he wanted it. I don't care what he want-- listen to me, Gilkrest. I went out on a limb to get you assigned to the President. And the next time, and unfortunately I assume there will be a next time, you go by the book. Lead car, followup, back up. You're there to protect him, not to please him. I don't want to be the one to have to tell the President's wife she's a widow. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. [traffic noise] Morning Mr. Morton. How are you today? All right, how you doin', Phil? - Fine, fine, fine. - Good. Is my sister in? Ah, I think she is, sir. I haven't seen her come down yet. Great. Can you keep an eye on that for me please? - I sure will, sir. - Thank you. Ah, taxi? [soft music] [door tapping] Who is it? Your basic neighborhood weirdo. DONNA MORTON: Oh, Ben. Ah. Oh, the ribs, watch the ribs. Oh. do you want some coffee? Yep. Welcome home. Hm. You changed the place around some, huh? DONNA MORTON: About a year ago. You're very observant. [soft music] Well, did you wow them in Paris? Uh-huh? Are you a legend in your own time? Same old thing, boring meetings, beautiful women. Oh, you really have it tough. Hey, you spend three weeks, eight hours a day discussing soybean crops. Ain't easy. [soft music] So, how are ya? OK. Sellin' any houses? Got a quarter of a million dollars? That's where they start. Piano wing? Much to the distress of my downstairs neighbor who threaten to call the gendarmes on me. Something unreasonable about wanting to sleep. Hm, what time was that? Oh, 3:00 in the morning. Oh. Maybe 4:00. Donna, the night person. I can remember when you were afraid to be alone in the dark. [piano keys rippling] Still am. Hm, in the dark maybe, but not alone. Tell me somethin'. Who's your new love? What are you talking about? The big fat limousine with a chauffeur, the guy in the Brooks Brothers suit. Your limousine passed my cab last night. Who is it? DONNA MORTON: Just a guy. Ah, no name. Since when do we pry into each other's personal lives? Pry? What are you talkin' about? Ben, I'm not hiding anything from you. It-- it's just-- well, you don't have to know everything about my life. Mm. I'm a big girl now. Mm. Oh. What are you doing around noon? Nothin'. Gwen's coming by. I know she'd love to see you. I'll be here. Do you want some more coffee? I'd love some, but I gotta get to work. [machines running] [keys tapping] [machine auto typing] All right. [keys tapping] Nice goin'. [suspenseful music] [knocking] Come in. What is it, Victoria? This just came by pouch from our people in Moscow. This is the translation. Donna Morton, a Soviet agent? It's Brown Bear, all right. And it's deciphered correctly. I've checked it a dozen times. [piano music] [phone rings] Hello? Yes it is. Oh, hi. Good. Being very domestic, playing the piano. Anytime, you know that. Of course. Of course, I understand. I'll be ready. What did Gilkrest say? [office noises] Good afternoon, Senator. Mr. Gilkrest. He wants her brought here tonight, 7:45. Here? [boat horns] DOCK MANAGER: Now hear this. Liberty will commence at 1300 for sections two and three. Security section must run the fan tail with the-- This better be worth it. I've got an office full of people waiting. One reason I thought it'd be better for us to meet here. Ah, one reason? Mr. Murphy, at my agency we have a saying that ah the only thing at the White House that listens are the walls. I don't believe this cloak and dagger. I-- I just don't believe it. I-- if you wanted to talk to me privately, you didn't have to drag me all the way out here. On the contrary, I think the setting is particularly apt. Could you please come to the point? The girl, Mr. Murphy, is a Soviet spy. We know Brown Bear is a Soviet agent right here in Washington. I'm sure you know who I'm talking about. The message was lifted right out of the Kremlin. The Secret Service checked this girl out thoroughly. It's impossible. Obviously not thoroughly enough. I think you'd better speak to the President. The man cares about this girl. Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to him? He's right in the middle of negotiations with the Chinese. If I walk into the President with this, and it proves to be wrong, it's gonna be your head to go. Do you really want me to act on this? We'll start a thorough investigation. In the meantime, I think it'd be wise if you stopped the girl from seeing the President for a while. Really? How do you suggest I do that? Mr. Murphy, I've given you the information. And I've given you my assessment. [boat horn] DONNA MORTON: Gwen. - I know I'm late. I'm sorry. My car broke down. Oh, it's all right. Hi. I'll take your coat. Oh, look at him. Hi. Gwen, come and have some sherry. GWEN BOWERS: OK. Ben, you're not leaving? Oh, what a terrific suit. Yes, well. A Kordal? Saint Laurent perhaps? Actually, a guy named Benny in Philadelphia. Well, it's just wonderful. It really suits you, pardon the pun. So what's the latest dirt goin' around town? Well, there's Senator Franken's, but then you've heard that. No, I've been away. Tell me, as if I could stop you. DONNA MORTON: Gwen. Thanks. Well, it seems that the good senator was caught in a motel room with two hookers. And he told the police, and listen to this please, that he was personally investigating the vice problem in Washington. But the only thing he couldn't explain was why he was doing it stark naked, whatever that means. Oh, do you love it? Gwenny, do you know everything in this town? No. No, I don't know with whom or where your sister is spending her evenings. And you won't either. So you can just skip the subject. Well, would you listen to that? Have you met my best friend? My sister. I know less about her than you do. Hey you guys. Pass on, OK? Well, what's new in your life, handsome? Oh, would you look at that face. He's hiding something. What? Come on. He doesn't want to talk about it. Who said I didn't wanna talk about it? My life's an open book. Paperback. Ha. All right, as a matter of fact, I did meet this girl on the plane coming back from Paris. And um, I kind of like her. GWEN BOWERS: That's it? You met a girl and you kind of like her, that's the whole story? What do you want from me, wedding bells? Mm-hm. Will she be around long enough for me to meet her? Tonight? Oh, I can't tonight. Well, she might be around tomorrow night. Oh. What does she do? I don't know. Well, does she live in Washington? Nope. Where does she live? Boston, I think. Boston you think. Mm-hm. You two ever ah stop and talk to one another? I think I'll leave now. OK, I'll let you guys speculate, OK? Well, at least tell us what her name is. - I don't know for sure. - He doesn't know. Bye. Oh, he's so cute. Mm-hm. I wish he noticed me. But you're friends. Yeah, but that's no fun. Oh, gosh. Look at the time. We're gonna be late. Come on. [suspenseful music] [camera shutter click] [suspenseful music] [soft music and fire crackling] Hey landlord, I can't sleep. The bedside lamp is out so I can't read. And there's no soap in the shower so I can't wash. Is this anyway to run a hotel? I really like you. More. No, I'm serious. I just can't understand how you can step off of an airplane into my life without any kind of hassle at all. Ah-- Can I ask you something? That ah jogging outfit, you know, the one you lent me. Is um that really your sister's? Yeah. Why? You're jealous? No. Maybe. All right, I'll tell you somethin'. You know, that whole um airplane relationship thing? It never happened to me before. I don't believe you. I swear. Well, you big phony. All that no past, no future, just the present. We make right here a peak experience. I'm just doin' the best I can. Mm-hm. So, what's your name? I told you Margaret. That's not what your bags say, Helen Kincaid of Boston, Massachusetts. Have you searched my purse too? Your name tag is on your bag. Oh. So what is it? Is it Helen or Margaret. Mugsy. Come on, I wanna get to know you. I wa-- I wanna know, like, um, well, what do you do for a living? I'm a spy. Come on. You made the rules. Break'em. Why? I think this is exciting. Look, you tell me who you are and what your business is. Or I will be forced to torture it out of you. Promises, promises. [soft music] Good evening, Miss Morton. Good evening, Charlie. Good evening. Mr. Gilkrest. [traffic noise] JIM GILKREST: Mr. President, Miss Morton's here. In here please. [door locks] Goodnight, Jan. Goodnight, Jim. Hello Jan. Good evening, Mrs. Whitmore. Is my husband still in the Oval Office? No he isn't. The fact is, I don't know where he is. Good night. - Good night. - Jim. - Ma'am? Is my husband in there? Ah, yes, Mrs. Whitmore. But I'm sorry, the President can't be disturbed. Well, not even for just a minute? Albert's baked his favorite cookies. Oh, ma'am, President Whitmore left specific instructions. It's the China thing. Well, I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I-- JIM GILKREST: I'm sorry. [tray crashes] [traffic noise] I think-- What is it? Today, when I left my apartment, and-- and then later, I-- I was out showing some houses. I-- I had the feeling I was being followed. What makes you say that? Well, I saw the same man twice. Tall man with dark glasses and a camera. And? When-- when I looked for him again, he wasn't there. I wouldn't worry about it. It's probably some tourist. They take pictures of everything. Heh. Yes, of course. No, I'll take care of it right away. DONNA MORTON (ON PHONE): You sure? CHARLIE: Absolutely. DONNA MORTON (ON PHONE): I can rely on you, Charlie? CHARLIE: Yes, not to worry. It'll be all right. Let me see you inside. Oh, thanks, I'm fine. Thanks, Charlie. [traffic noise] Gilchrist to base. AGENT (ON RADIO): Base. Do we have Donna Morton under surveillance? AGENT (ON PHONE): Nobody in Secret Service, Jim. Thanks. Out. Is this all we have on Miss Morton? Yes, sir. And it's up to date. OK, Bradley, go ahead. BRADLEY: Donna Morton. She sells real estate out of M. Burns Realtors, has for the past six years. This is her girlfriend, Gwen Bowers. We have a complete file on her if you want it. Donna Morton worked on the President's senatorial campaign about five years ago. They've had contact, how much is still unsure. She drinks, but not to excess. Smokes marijuana infrequently and is heterosexual, in fact, very heterosexual. Let's try it without the comment. Sorry, sir. We do have a potential problem. Her brother, Ben Morton, is a part-time courier of ours. Let's freeze him out. Pull his card. That'll be all, gentlemen. Bradley, I want Miss Morton's apartment and telephone bugged. I want you to do it personally. Pick one other man you can trust to share the monitoring. [piano music] No, no, no, no, no, a one and a three does not get you back on the board. Gimme a break. There are no breaks in this game. Boy, you're in a strange mood today. I'm happy. A ha, ha. You always cheat when you're happy? It's only a game. Today it's only game. Funny, just a couple of days ago, winning this game was a life or death matter with you. I think this secret love of yours is making you crazy. I think you're right. And I love it. Oh, you're making me crazy. How could you keep some guy a secret from me? I don't understand that? Please, Gwen, I can't ta-- [phone rings] You're just going to have to accept that. [phone rings] Why? Hello? Yes, it is. Ah, the Phantom. Oh, it's nice to hear you laugh. I can't either. Oh, yes. It's all right. I understand. No. I'll stay home. It's OK. You too. Goodbye. [piano music] It's your move. [piano music] I guess I'd better go. No, please stay. [piano music] Damn. Oh. What is going on with you? You're gonna explode. Oh. GWEN BOWERS: Hello? This is Gwen, you dummy. I know you haven't got anything in the world to hide so it's gotta be him, right? And this is Washington, so he's in the government. And he's married because they're always married. So? So, you're not the first woman in this town who's gone beyond the fringe over some married senator or congressman. Gwen, if I tell you, you've got to promise me never to tell anyone. No, I00 I mean it. Well, of course not. He's the President. What? He's the President. Oh, oh, are you in trouble. I love him. GWEN BOWERS: Even worse. Are you going to preach to me? No. That was him just now. He had to cancel out tonight. Well, that's the way it is. With him I never know from minute to minute what to do. I'll be all ready to go out to meet him, 15 minutes before I'm supposed to leave, he'll call and cancel. Well. I'm gonna call my folks and tell them I can't come. No. I'm not leaving you. [sirens] Thanks. Little Donna Morton and the President. [sirens] [suspenseful music] But as difficult as the situation is, it's-- it's still the best thing that's ever happened to me in my life. Oh, Donna, you know it has no future. [phone rings] I know. Hello? Yes, it is. But I just talked to him an hour ago. All right. I'll be ready. His plans changed. I'm being picked up at 7:30. Listen, come and talk to me while I get ready. OK. Come on, you can still make it to Baltimore. You know what? You can take my car. Oh, I don't know if I should take your car. Please take it. [office chatter] Another meeting on the yacht? Ah, yeah. Oh, great. With all our problems, he has to waste his time and energy on some chippy. I wouldn't call her that. You wouldn't? What would you call her? A rather nice girl who's in over her head. The President's in over his head too, Gilkrest. And I want these meetings stopped for a while so he can keep his mind on the Chinese. You're gonna have to help me. Well, what can I do? Level with her. Suggest she be sick for a few days. She may not buy it. Try. Oh, that's what stinks. We could get stoned from the fumes of that stuff. Wanna meet my sister? Sure. [phone dials] [phone rings] Hello? Hey, Gwenny. GWEN BOWERS (ON PHONE): Hi Ben. My sister around? Yeah, but she's dressing. Can I take her message? BEN MORTON (ON PHONE): Yeah, ask her if she wants to have dinner with Mugsy and me tonight. Well, I know she can't. She's got a date. Ah, how about you? You busy? Oh, thanks. But I'm having dinner with my folks in Baltimore. All right. Guess I'm stuck with this girl all by myself. Hey. Hey. What was that? BEN MORTON (ON PHONE): She hit me. I like her. Bye, Ben. BEN MORTON (ON PHONE): Bye-bye. Hey, Donna, I'm leavin'. Bye, Gwen. Thanks. Talk to you tomorrow. Bye. [horn honking] [intense music] The Morton girl has left the building. I'm going in. [suspenseful music] [knocking] [suspenseful music] [door opens] [intense music] No. Please. No. Oh. Ah! [loud thud] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [horn honking] Hasn't Miss Morton come down yet? No sir. Buzz her apartment for me would you please? Sure. [suspenseful music] [door buzzer] Maybe she's on her way down. No, she's always down here and ready. [intense music] [knocking] Miss Morton? [suspenseful music] [keys rattling] [knocking] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [eerie music] [phone dialing] Code zebra alpha zero. This is Gilkrest. The girl is dead in her apartment. The doorman saw me come up. You better make arrangements. [phone dialing] Police. I want to report a body at 570 River Drive, apartment 402. I want to report a body at 570 River Drive, apartment 402. [door slams] It was an accident. This is the CSA. We don't have accidents, we plan accidents. I thought she had left. I saw her car-- Never mind that. Did anyone see you? No. Are you sure? Well? Well, I don't think anybody saw me. But a limousine was pulling up just as I-- I want you out of the country tomorrow. Peters, you arrange it. Go on, get out, both of you. Bradley? You sure it was him? It was him. I-- I don't know that he killed her, but he was there. Oh, he killed her. Craig wanted me to keep her away from the President. He just found another method. Oh, you can't be serious. What, kill a girl because she's having an affair with the President? I don't believe it. She was a Russian agent. What Donna? They had surveillance on her. She suspected that was happening. She told me. Did he see you? No, I don't think so. ED MURPHY: You better hope not. Oh, come on, Gilkrest. Don't be so naive. The Central Security Agency doesn't play around. What, then you'd better nail them. It's Craig I'm after, and I'll nail him on my own good time. The President shoulda-- shoulda kicked him out when he took office. And I suggest you don't talk to anybody about Bradley. Go on home. [phone buzzer] NORMA (ON INTERCOM): It's the President, Mr. Murphy. He's calling from the yacht. OK. It's nights like this I wish I were back selling detergents. [soft music] I hope you like this, ma'am. It's a bit young but a very brave little wine. Oh. We will have strawberries and brandy for dessert. Oh, lovely. Thought you'd like that. Isn't it so much nicer eating here at home? Mm-hm. You know, I'm beginning to feel like a French poodle. I lie around all day and you take me out for my morning exercise jog. [soft music] [phone rings] [soft music] Hello? Yes, this is Ben Martin. What? I'll be right over. [soft music] What is it, Ben? My sister's dead. [suspenseful music] [officers chatter] Mr. Morton? Mr. Morton. Hm? I'm Lieutenant Gordon. Would you care to sit down? [camera shutter click] What happened? Well, as near as we can figure, she opened the door for someone. There's no sign of a break-in, no sign of a burglary or a robbery. There was a struggle. And it happened. Nobody heard anything, nobody saw anything. No, we checked the neighboring apartments, the doorman, nothing. We figure it happened around 7:30. Shortly after that we logged in an anonymous phone call from a, well, it brought us here. Maybe you can help us. Do you know if she had any enemies? Not my sister. Rejected boyfriends? Hm? Rejected boyfriends? No, I don't think so. I-- you might ask ah, her friend Bowers. She might know about that. Where were you tonight? I was at home. You called me there. Right, right. You were there all evening? What the hell are you tryin' to say? Just asking where you were. I was at home. OK? I'm just doin' my job. Have you got some suspects then? The investigation just started. I'm sorry. I wish we had more to go on. [paper snaps] Idiot. Idiot. [flute music] You think you could eat some breakfast, Ben? They're not gonna get away with it. They're not gonna file this away as another unsolved murder. You have to give them a chance. [birds chirping] I hate this place. Donna's death isn't even gonna ripple the water. Power, that's all these people care about. It eats'em up. Ben. Do they know who's limousine Donna was in the other night? [birds chirping] Come on. [suspenseful music] POLICE WOMAN: I'm sorry I can't do this. Oh, come on. Do me a favor, please. Right this way. And don't forget to send me the backup paperwork. I really appreciate this. [suspenseful music] Here's the license number of the limousine. [suspenseful music] Registered to the US Government, branch of the executive and the department of the White House. Thank you. [suspenseful music] [ominous music] Ma'am? Yes? I need the exact information you just gave that man. Phil. I'm awfully sorry about your sister, Mr. Morton. Thank you, Phil. Listen, do you know where I can get in touch with Charlie, the night doorman? Oh, he's gone on vacation, went down to Florida, I believe. Lucky guy. Can I get up to my sister's apartment now? Oh, sure. The police are finished with it now. OK, thanks, Phil. All right. [soft music] What do you think I oughta do about all this stuff? Well, ah, why don't you just pick out a couple things that remind you of her and sell the rest, I guess. There's so many things I didn't know about her, so many things. [knocking] Sorry to bother ya. Here are the keys to your sister's car. Miss Bowers just brought'em back. Thank you. Why did Gwen have the car? [kid's chatter] About um what time did you leave her? Ah, 7:15. You told me she had a date. She did. She was being picked up at 7:30. That was around the time that she was killed. Was it the limousine that picked her up? Yes. Who was she seeing? Oh, Ben, please it go. No, no, I know the limousine came from the White House. Well, then just let it go-- Now what the hell's the matter with you, now, Gwen? You're supposed to be her best friend. I loved her. Oh, so you're standin' here tellin' me that this girl that you supposedly loved should be buried and forgotten? [birds chirping] Oh, I wish she'd never told me. Who is it? [kid's chatter] Carl Whitmore. The President? She loved him, Ben. And she believed that he loved her. I've been afraid to tell anybody. I didn't even go to the police. I just don't want her name dragged through the papers, you know? - How long was this going on? They met about six years ago when she was working on his senatorial campaign. BEN MORTON: Mm-hm. And then after he became President, he would have picked up and taken to his yacht. You know who picked her up? No. [kid's chatter] I loved her. [kid's chatter] Thank you, sir. How are you today? - All right. How you doin'? - Fine. [beeping] I'm sorry, sir. Your ID'S been pulled. I can't let you enter? Can I use your phone a second? I can straighten this out. No, I'm sorry, only active agents and personnel can use the interoffice phones. And without an ID-- It's all kinda catch-22-ish isn't it? Yes? AGENT JOHNSON (ON INTERCOM): Agent Johnson, sir. I've got Ben Morton on the line. He wants to know why his card was pulled. Tell him that ah while his sister's death is being investigated, it is desirable that we sever his ties with the agency. AGENT JOHNSON: Right, sir. [phone buzzer] - Yeah? NORMA (ON INTERCOM): Mr. Morton's here to see you, sir. Send him in. Ben. - Hello Ed. How are ya? It's terrible about Donna. Terrible. I read about it in the papers. I'm so sorry. Did they get the guy yet? No. I appreciate you seein' me. Oh, hey, you did great work for us during the campaign. So did Donna. We don't forget. [phone buzzer] No calls please, OK? Ah, I'm really swamped. I don't have a minute. What can I do for you? Yeah, I wanted to ask you about a limousine registered to the White House. The-- oh, the ah license number's right here, ah, G1158213. Yeah? Oh, ah, I saw Donna in this limousine a couple of nights before ah, you know. And I-- I ah-- I also want to know about this man that she was having an affair with. I thought maybe, ah, all these things fit in together somehow. I thought maybe you might be able to shed some light on it for me. Whatever gave you the idea I was taking out Donna? Not you, your boss. The President and Donna? Donna told someone she was having an affair with Whitmore. Who'd she tell? It's a reliable source. Ben, I-- I-- I realize how this whole thing must have hurt you. But President Whitmore neither has the time nor the inclination to do anything like you're talking about. Now, ti's just as simple as that. And as for Donna being in one of our limousines, the staff sneaks out with them all the time. It could have been anybody, anybody but the President. He's been a little bit busy of late. Listen, if you need anything more, just pick up the phone. I'll be there, OK? And I'm-- I'm very sorry about this. Thank you. [keys tapping] [phone buzzer] [intense music] How much longer? As long as it takes. [intense music] MARGARET "MUGSY" EVANS: Is that him? No. [intense music] Look, there goes $25. You coulda taken me out for dinner with that money. You know, I get the distinct feeling you're not hanging on my every word. [traffic noise] [suspenseful music] BEN MORTON: That's him. That's the guy I saw in the limousine with Donna. Let's go, hurry up. [intense music] [tires squealing] [suspenseful music] [ominous music] [horn honking] JIM GILKREST: Hey, how are ya? [kissing sound] Give me a kiss. MRS. GILKREST: How are you? Come to mama. JIM GILKREST: Hi, Cleo. Thanks very much now. - Oh, it's so nice. Oh, I know. JIM GILKREST: All right, everybody inside and one dog. [birds chirping] Where you going? To talk to him. Are you crazy? If he does know anything about your sister's death, what do you think he's gonna do, invite you in for tea? He's a family man. So was the godfather. He's not gonna do anything with his kids around. [car door buzzer] [birds chirping] [kid's chatter] MRS. GILKREST: Jim? What is it? Hon, take the kids out in the backyard for a bit. Why? It's business. [kid's chatter] [knocking] Yes? Hello. My name's Ben Morton. I'm Donna's brother. Ah, I'd like to talk to you for a moment if I could. Come on in. Thanks. I just wanna talk to you. Shut up, just shut up. Ah. MRS. GILKREST: Jim? Gabby-- MRS. GILKREST: What's going on? JIM GILKREST: --go back with the kids, please. MRS. GILKREST: Is everything all right? JIM GILKREST: Yes, just-- it's all right. Just go back with the kids, please. Now just go on. MRS. GILKREST: All right. Mm. What do you want? I saw you one night in the limousine with my sister. You're mistaken. I've never been with your sister anywhere. I've never even met her. You're lying. Well, what do you want me to say? You've got me mixed up with somebody else. I don't think so. I saw you and Donna in a limousine a few days before she was killed. I know she was seeing the President. And I wanna know how you fit in. I'm sorry. I can't help you. BEN MORTON: I said, I wanna know where you fit in. I already said I was sorry. [suspenseful music] [car door buzzing] His name is Gilkrest. He pulled a gun on me. Ben, stop this. You're over your head. These people, they're in a different league than you are. They're professionals. Is that supposed to give'em a license to kill? Go the police, please? I don't want you killed too. [phone buzzer] Yeah? NORMA (ON INTERCOM): It's Mr. Gilkrest for you, sir. OK put him on. Hey Jim. I was tailed home today by Donna Morton's brother. Oh, damn. JIM GILKREST (ON PHONE): He tried to question me about his sister. - What'd you tell him? Nothing, listen, I'm not worried about his questions. He knows I used to escort Donna in the limousine. If he knows, so could the CSA. Take tomorrow off. Sit tight. I'll get in touch. Damn. Jim, what is it? Some things about this job I hate. The guy's name is Gilkrest. [phone rings] He lives in Arlington at ah 6300 Bonneville Street. Now, he showed up in a limousine. So I'm sure, Charlie, the night doorman must have seen him come in. He told us he didn't see anyone. Hey, could you put that down for a second please? [phone rings] Sorry. It's my kid's birthday next week. Yeah. I think they must have brought him off. Why did you let a material witness leave the city? He wasn't a material witness. Maybe he should have been. Do you always tell people how to run their business? Yeah, but you're not doing anything. [phone rings] All right. Let me-- let me try to get this straight. You're telling me that your sister was a very personal friend of the President's and that someone in the White House had her killed? Who? I don't know who had her killed. What I'm telling you is that I believe that Gilkrest was there. I think you should talk to him. [phone rings] LIEUTENANT GORDON: All right, Ben. All right, we'll talk to him. Thank you. How old's your kid? Gonna be 10. [phone rings] Good night. [phone rings] [knocking] Come in. Yes, sir? Oh, come in, Peters. It seems a Secret Service man named Gilkrest was outside Donna Morton's apartment house when Bradley came out. I don't know if he spotted Bradley. See what you can find out. Right. Oh, and, ah, Peters? AGENT PETERS: Sir? Just a second. I want to talk to you about Ben Morton. [birds chirping] Orange juice and wheat germ? No thank you. Hey, I got a great idea. It's such a beautiful day, why don't I race you around the block? You're too fast for me. I owe ya a rematch. Our relationship is fragile enough. You may even win. [birds chirping] Are you challenging me? [birds chirping] [engine starts] When do we start racing? Now. [foot steps pound the pavement] [ominous music] Come on. Come on. [intense music] Ben. [loud thump] BEN MORTON: Mugsy. [tires squealing] Don't touch her. Call the ambulance. Mugsy? [sirens] VOICE OVER INTERCOM: Dr. Remic. Dr. Remic, check with intensive care desk, please. Dr. Remic. NURSE: Excuse me. Excuse me, I'm gonna need some information on the patient, please. Can you give me her name? I don't know for sure. I need her name. Ah, excuse me, I'll see what I can find out. Excuse me, Miss. Who is he? I don't know. Operator, could you please give me the number for information for Boston? [phone rings] Hello? BEN MORTON (ON PHONE): Hello. Is this the home of Helen Kincaid? Yes. BEN MORTON (ON PHONE): To whom am I speaking. Her husband. Hello? Hello? Ah, yes. I'm calling from Washington DC. Ah, Helen has been in an accident. Is this supposed to be funny? My wife just left for work 10 minutes ago. Tell me how she got to Washington. Do you know anyone by the name of Mugsy? No, I don't. [phone buzzer] I told you, no calls. NORMA (ON INTERCOM): Sorry, sir, it's about Ben Morton. Well? NORMA (ON INTERCOM): A police report says he's been involved in a hit and run. See if you can reach Gilkrest. MRS. GILKREST: Jim? Mr. Murphy's on the phone. He says it's urgent. OK. [birds chirping] [dogs barking] Hello? Jim, this is Ed Murphy. I think it'd be a good idea if you took a trip somewhere. Well, why? What's going on? Ben Morton and his girl were victims of a hit and run a few hours ago. CSA? ED MURPHY (ON PHONE): Could be. Did they get him? No, no, Ben's OK. His girl's in the Potomac General Hospital. Mr. Murphy, I think you better step into this right now. The timing's wrong. For who? They'll get Morton. They'll come after me while you sit there playing your power game with Craig? Trust me on this, Gilkrest. I'm a professional, Ed. I don't trust anybody. [suspenseful music] VOICE ON INTERCOM: Dr. Golden, call seventh floor, please. Dr. Golden. Dr. Jones, call the pharmacy, please. Dr. Harvard Jones. Dr. Jones, call the pharmacy, please. Dr. Harvard Jones. [music playing] Mr. Morton? The doctor says you can see her for a few minutes now. Thank you. Is she gonna be all right? Yes, she's a very luck girl. [phone rings] [soft music] Hi. Hi. If I sound a little funny it's 'cause of that stuff they're giving me. Yeah. You got a couple of cracked ribs. Won't be able to hug each other for a while. Mm-hm. Who are you? Who do you work for? The CSA? Russians? Sure, I'm Mata Hari. You dumb jerk. I illustrate children's books. Ohm, what's your name? Ben, don't spoil it. I mean, I've had my first trip to Paris, my first trip to Washington, my first airplane relationship, most of it's been good. What is your name? Margaret Evans. So who's Helen Kincaid? Remember I saw your luggage? That's my sister. I borrowed her luggage. Your sister? MARGARET "MUGSY" EVANS: Mm-hm. So how come her husband never heard of anyone called Mugsy. Bill? Well, he-- he just knows me as Margaret. Mugsy's from my childhood. I'm sorry. - You should be. - I am. Good. These are for you. Oh, Ben, they're lovely. Thank you. I didn't send'em. Thanks. [suspenseful music] They're not for me. They're for you. Gilkrest wants you to meet him at the zoo and make sure you're not followed. Ben? [soft music] It's OK. [soft music] [door closes] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] Excuse me, sir, are you Mr. Morton? That's right. Well, a man said for me to tell ya to meet him in the old zoo. Um, what about this picture? Thank you. [suspenseful music] [rocks crumbling] [flute music] [suspenseful music] Morton? Were you careful? I took a bus. We're both in danger, you know? From who? CSA. One of their agents, guy named Bradley, probably killed your sister. I saw him coming from our building just after she was killed. Why would they kill her? Because she was an agent for the KGB. Donna? I don't believe it. Who knows in this business? You're really just a junior member of the Department of Agriculture? My sister wasn't a spy. JIM GILKREST: Look, I'm telling you this because I need your help. Now I can't rely on Murphy-- [silenced bullet] Oh. [intense music] Hey. [intense music] Lie still. Get some help for this guy. [suspenseful music] [silenced gunfire] [intense music] Hold it. [intense music] [tires squealing] [thud] [intense music] ED MURPHY: OK, Norma, tell him I'll be back in 10 minutes. Hello, Ben. They called me from a meeting. Why didn't you tell me what was going on? What do you mean? Did you know they thought Donna was a Russian agent? Who told you that? Gilkrest before he was shot. Gilkrest is dead. Why didn't you tell me what was happening? Think about it a minute. How could I? Because she's my sister. Because you're supposed to be my friend. All I know is that three people are dead. And you knew what was going on and you didn't say anything. I never expected anything like this. Well, you got it now. I want you to tell me who killed my sister. Oh, Ben. Was it Craig? Did he kill her 'cause he thought she was a spy? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I mean it. I'm not sure. But it could have been him, right? I gotta get to the CSA computer. That's where the answers are. You gotta get me in there. - I can't. Oh, yes, you can. I could be a real problem to this administration. Help me. [phone dialing] Hello. My name is Ben Morton. Ah, yes, Mr. Morton. Would you sign here please? Thank you. Would you wear this, please? Thank you. [foot steps in hallway] [loud machinery running] Hello. Hi. You're up late. Yeah. Ah, my name is Ben Morton. I need some information. OK. I have to check you out first. [keys tapping] BEN MORTON: What does that mean? That's your clearance. I want full information on a Donna Morton. [keys tapping] Why has it stopped? DEPUTY DIRECTOR CRAIG (ON INTERCOM): This Deputy Director Craig, Mr. Morton. How can I help you? Just speak Mr. Morton. I can hear you. I wanna know everything about my sister's death and why you thought she was working for the Russians. Craig? Craig, can you hear me? DEPUTY DIRECTOR CRAIG (ON INTERCOM): I hear you. I'm clearing additional security channels. Watch your screen. All right, young lady, continue. [keys tapping] Come on, Craig, I want all of it. Craig? Craig, can you hear me? I know there's more. DEPUTY DIRECTOR CRAIG: I hear you, Mr. Morton. Will you leave us, please? Yes, sir. Excuse the theatrics but what I have to say is top security. Did you have my sister killed? Come on, Mr. Morton. Why should I do that? Considering her relationship with the President, I'd be far more likely to question her-- - Gilkrest saw-- - --then kill her. --your man Bradley leaving her apartment building at the time she was killed. Exactly. I had sent Bradley to bring your sister in for questioning. He found her dead. So far, no one has any idea who killed her. I want to talk to Bradley. Where is he? South America. He's on assignment in Peru. You can talk to him when he returns. And you think my sister was a Russian agent? What you are reading was taken from the Kremlin by one of my agents. I don't believe it. I'm sorry. You know it is possible that they killed her. Brown Bear? A known KGB agent here in Washington. I want to talk to him. Who is he? He knows we're onto him. I don't mind telling you. He's Anatoly, the Naval attache at the embassy. I doubt if you'll get to him. [suspenseful music] [FOOT STEPS ECHOING IN PARKING GARAGE] Pull over. [intense music] Tell me about Donna Morton, Brown Bear? Who are you? Her brother. I'm sorry that she died. It was stupid. Put the gun away. You don't need it. She wasn't a Russian spy. No. She was not a spy. Then why did you send that message? Mischief. We knew of her relationship with the President. We knew the Chinese talks were going on. It was a game, something to keep your government off balance. A game? A game? I cannot believe the CSA meant to kill her. It had to be an accident. It was too clumsy not to have been. They killed Gilkrest. They tried to kill me. Mischief to an accident to murder, perhaps the history of World War, my friend. May I ask who informed you I was Brown Bear? Craig. I knew my days in America were over. Unfortunate. I like it here. [car door slams] [dogs barking] HI. MARGARET "MUGSY" EVAN HI. Are they letting me out? Not for a couple of days. I brought some of the stuff that you wanted. Thanks. How are you? Lousy. Did you meet with Gilkrest? Yeah. I found out Donna was not a Russian agent. Yeah, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all the information to Gordon. He's the only one I can trust. I'll let the police handle it from here. Oh good. Yeah. I think Craig is the one behind all this. I'm going with you. No, you stay here until the doctor says you can go. Ben? Some airplane relationship, huh? [soft music] Thanks Diane. I'll take it from here. Ben, I'd like you to leave town for a while un-- until we need you. - That's fine with me. Hey, I just wanna spend some time with my girl. Well, I can take it from here. You've given me more than enough. If I can get Craig, I can get'em all, at least I can try. Thanks. Thank you. Yeah. [phone rings] Ben, let me know where you are. [phone dialing] What are you doing here? I let myself out. You said you were coming here so I took a cab. I wanna tell you something. We're gettin' outta this town. Hm? Yeah, only this time we're takin' a train. A train? Yeah. [music playing]
