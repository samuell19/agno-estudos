Calling CapeCom. CapeCom? This is Jupiter 16. Give a go for fourth orbit? CapeCom to Jupiter 16, can you confirm 02 pressure is within limit? Roger, everything looks good in the environmental control system. Ok, everything looks good from here. You have a go for fourth orbit. Jupiter 16, roger. You're stowing all loose gear. Ready for the EVA. Jupiter 16, this is CapeCom. Start your EVA anytime you're ready. Remember that you have plenty of time in the other EVA is for experiments. So don't stay out too long, Chris. Ok, flight. Don't worry. We'll stick to plan. Roger. CapeCom to Jupiter 16, on my mark it will be four plus three seven. Four, three, two, one, mark. CapeCom, this is Chris, I'm out. - Everything looks Ok. - Good. The manoeuvring unit is working this time. I used it to get out and it makes things a lot easier. CapeCom to Hawaii, this is flight control, come in please. Hawaii, roger. Hawaii, we expect to start EVA over your station on this pass. Hawaii to Jupiter 16, there's an unidentified object closing on you fast from astern. Can you see it? Hawaii from CapeCom, we have nothing here, hold while we check the space track. Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter 16, an unidentified object on our scope closing fast. I see nothing. Can you give me a bearing? Appears to be coming up fast, from astern. Hey, now I see it. It's another spacecraft. I repeat, it's another spacecraft. Does it look like a close pass? You're breaking up. Say again. Repeat, does it look like a close pass? Hey Chris, what's happening? It's coming right at us, the front is opening up, I repeat, the front is opening up. - It's coming right at us. - Chris, get back in, get back in. Do you read me? You're breaking up. Repeat, you're breaking up. What's happening? Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Hawaii to Jupiter 16. You're breaking up. Come in, please, over. Jupiter 16. You're breaking up, my lead line... Hawaii to Jupiter 16, Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Are you receiving me? Come in, please. Over. Hello Houston, we've lost our radio contact. We've also lost him on the scope. Unidentified object is still orbiting. Alert all stations and track him closely. It is ridiculous for the Soviet government to deny responsibility in this matter. The Soviet government denies all knowledge of this affair. The world knows we are a peace-loving people. I hereby give notice that in 20 days time... the United States intents to launch her next spaceship into orbit. My government has instructed me to inform you... that any interference with the spaceship will be regarded as an act of war. May I ask what motive... our Russian friends would've for wishing to destroy American spacecraft? My government sees this as nothing less than a blatant attempt... to gain complete and absolute control of space itself for military purposes. We don't agree. Her Majesty's Government is not convinced... that this intruder missile originated from Soviet Russia. Our tracking station in Singapore reported faint echoes of this craft... coming down the Sea of Japan area. Might I suggest gentleman, that this... is where you should concentrate your intelligence forces. The prime minister asked me to assure you that this is what we propose to do. As a matter of fact, our man in Hong Kong is working on it now. Why do Chinese girls taste different from all other girls? You think we better? No, just different. Like Peking duck is different from Russian caviar but I love them both. Darling, I give you very best duck. Oh, would be lovely. We've had some interesting times together Ling, I'll be sorry to go.

Present. Fire. - Carry on. - Aye aye, sir. Request permission to come aboard, sir? - Permission granted. - Thank you. - Take this officer AFT. - Yes, sir. Number One, take her up to 90ft. Course zero four five. Aye aye, sir. - Hello Penny. - You better go right in. You're late as usual, even from your own funeral. Well, we corpses about should be no sense of time. In you go, sir. Thank you, ma'am. - Oh, sit down 007. - Thank you sir. - No ill effects? - None at all, sir. Well, now you're dead, perhaps some of your old friends will pay a little less attention to you for a while. Give you more elbow room. You'll need it, too. This is the big one 007. That's why I'm out here myself I'm taking you fully briefed. Oh yes sir, but there's one thing I don't understand. If our Singapore tracking station is correct about the rocket not landing in Russia... - then, where did it land? - We assume it's Japan. Mind you, all this is pure guesswork. But the P.M. wants us to play it with everything we've got. And the aerial reconnaissance? Every inch photographed, nothing. Are the Japanese equipped to launch such a rocket? - We don't think so. - Then who else is? That's what you've got to find out and fast, before the real shooting starts. This damn thing could blow up into a full-scale war. When you get to Tokyo, go to that name and address. Our man Henderson will contact you there. Henderson? Captain here, we're underway, full ahead. Right. - Well, that's all. - Thank you, sir. - 007. - Sir? We've only three weeks before the American launch the next one. - You know that? - Oh, yes sir. And my sources tell me the Russians are planning one even earlier than that. - So move fast 007. - Yes sir. Oh, by the way, how was the girl? Which girl? The Chinese one we fixed you up with. Another five minutes, I'd have found out. She'll never know what she missed. Miss Moneypenny, give 007 the password we've agreed with Japanese SIS. Yes, sir. We tried to think of something that you wouldn't forget. Yes? I love you. Repeat it please, to make sure you get it. Don't worry, I get it. Sayonara. James, good luck. Instant Japanese. You may need it. You forget, I took a first in oriental languages at Cambridge. Stand by to load. Lift to the launch. Tube loaded. Hubcap open. Fire. (speaks Japanese) (Japanese) This is your ticket. Thank you. Dozo. (instructions shouted in Japanese) I love you. I have a car nearby. - Where do you suggest we go? - I know a quiet hotel. - And? - Where your friend is waiting. Mr Henderson. Wasn't Mr Henderson able to come himself? I suppose not. - Why? - He didn't say. Well. I think it's about hotel-time. How long have been working for Henderson? Long enough to learn not to discuss such matters with strangers. (Japanese) - Mr Henderson is waiting for you. - You're not coming in with me? Mr Henderson would like to see you alone. Do come in. Mr Henderson? At your service. I believe you wanted to ask me some questions. Yes, excuse me. - Thank you. - I'm glad you got it right. I lost that in Singapore in 42. You must excuse this rather odd mixture of styles but I refuse to go entirely Japanese. Very fond of some of these old things. You've never been to Japan before, have you? No, never. I myself have lived here for... 28 years. And I'm just beginning to know my way about. Your most vital contact will be Tanaka. Tanaka? He's head of the Japanese secret service. And his identity is the most closely guarded secret in Japan. When can I see him? - You can see Tiger tonight. - Tiger? His closest friends are permitted to call him that. You've any leads of your own? Yes, I do. Oh, that's stirred not shaken. That was right? - Perfect. - Cheers. Russian vodka. Well done. Yes, I get it from the doorman at the Russian embassy. Amongst certain other things. Now, look. I think London's theory about the missile being fired from this country is right. I don't know how or where and don't ask me who's doing it either. But I'd have a shrewd idea that a major foreign power is behind it all. You mean, apart from Russia and Japan? It's not Russia old boy, I'm sure of that. It's not Japan either. Although a large Japanese industrial concern is... (Japanese) Good evening. Cheers. Siamese vodka? (shouting in Japanese) There he is. Freeze. (shouting in Japanese) Get in, quick. Now, what the hell is the score? What do you mean? My job is to help you. Like you helped Henderson? I'm taking you to a place of safety. No, this time I'm taking you. I want some information, I want it now. I have no information to give you. We'll see about that, slow down. Welcome. Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond. It is a great pleasure to meet you at last. And how do you like our country so far? I am a trifle disappointed at the ease with which I could pull you in. The one thing my honourable mother taught me long ago... was never to get into a car with a strange girl. But you, I'm afraid, will get into anything with any girl. I must say, you have a lot of energy for a dead man, Mr Bond. You are James Bond, aren't you? I am so very pleased to meet you, Bond-San. I really am. Permit me to introduce myself. My name is Tanaka. Please call me Tiger. If you're Tanaka, how do you feel about me? I love you. I'm glad we got out of the way. I'd like you to examine these as soon as possible. They're from Osato's safe. This is an order for naval stores. 500 kilos of butter, 50 containers of lox. What is lox? Oh, is American name for smoked salmon. But it's also the technical name for liquid oxygen, which makes rocket fuel. - Very interesting. - Yes. We must go. The journey out will be more dignified than the journey in. Oh, I wouldn't be difficult. - I'd like that negative enlarged. - Ok. (Japanese) My private train. I never travel in the streets of Tokyo. In my position, it would be most unwise. Very convenient. I imagine that your Mr M in London has a similar arrangement. M? Oh yes, but of course. Then the girl of the white sports car is one of us. - Aki? Yes. - Very competent. - Domo arigato. - Dozo. You like Japanese sake Mr Bond, or would you prefer vodka Martini? Oh no, I like sake. Especially when it's served at the correct temperature. 98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is. For a European, you are exceptionally cultivated. (Japanese) We'll see the photograph you found. Good. Is just a ship and a strip of land. It could be anywhere. My men found a microdot on the paper, enlarge. Says, Photograph taken by female American tourist from coastal vessel. The woman has been liquidated as a routine precaution. - Can we see the photograph again? - Of course. So they killed an innocent tourist for taking this? Can you make it bigger? Ning-Po. Check motor vessel Ning-Po, full details. All recent movements and present whereabouts. - What's that on the left? - Focus on the left. Ama, diving girls. - Can you identify that coastline? - Given time, yes. Who is the head of Osato Chemicals? Mr Osato. Can you arrange for me to have an appointment with him tomorrow? Of course. But tonight, consider my house yours. Including all of my possessions, naturally. My friend, now you take your first civilised bath. Really? Well, I like the plumbing. Place yourself entirely in their hands, my dear Bond-San. Rule number one, is never do anything for yourself when someone else can do it for you. - And number two? - Rule number two. In Japan, men always come first, women come second. I might just retire to here. Your English girls would never perform this simple service. I think I know one or two who might get round to it. Miss Moneypenny, perhaps? We have our sources, Bond-San, just like you. Don't get the soap in my eye, will you? (Japanese) I suppose you know what it is about you that fascinates them. It's the hair on your chest. Japanese men all have beautiful bare skin. Japanese proverb say, Bird never make nest in bare tree. If Henderson's theory is right... why would a foreign power want to launch missiles from Japan? Because if ever they were discovered, they could deny all responsibility. Especially if some private organisation is doing the work. - Osato? - Perhaps. Mr Osato is one of the greatest industrialists in Japan. No, he's merely a front. - Who is big enough? - SPECTRE. Could be. Now, massage. Which girl do you select? I'll just settle for this little old lady here. Good choice. She's very sexyful. The last time someone gave me a massage was in Hong Kong. But unfortunately, I take out it short. We were rudely interrupted by a couple of gunmen. So, we never got around to finishing it. This time, you shall finish it. Aki. No one will disturb you tonight. I think I will enjoy very much serving under you. - Mr Fisher? - Yes. - This way, please. - Thank you. Please come in, Mr Fisher. - Mr Osato is expecting you. - Thank you. You are three and a half minutes early. Please be seated. - How do you do, Mr Fisher? - How do you do? Miss Grant, my confidential secretary. - Hello. - Hello. May we offer you a glass of champagne, Mr Fisher? No, thank you, it's just too early in the morning for me. - You're quite sure? - Quite sure. I always take a glass in the morning, you should try it. It's bad for your liver, isn't it? Nonsense, it adds a sparkle to the day. Sure it does. A Dom Perignon 59, Mr Fisher. Are you really sure you won't change your mind? Well, if you insist. - Please be seated, Mr Fisher. - Thank you. So, you are the new managing director of Empire Chemicals? Yes. - What happened to Williamson? - Williamson? Oh yes, he died rather suddenly, poor chap. Ah, so. From what? He fell into a pulveriser at the works. Ah, so? How shocking. A very honourable death, all the same. Very. He gained great face with the company. I hope you are not taking any risks for yourself, Mr Fisher. Me? I never take any risks. You forgive me for saying so, but... I think you are taking one now. I am? You should give up smoking. Cigarettes are very bad for your chest. Mr Osato believes in a healthy chest. Really? Now then, you must tell me what I can do for you, Mr Fisher? Well, we're interested in the bulk buying of fermentation chemicals. Monosodium glutamate and ascorbic acid. Would you like a licence for manufacture? Yes, very much. So... I'll have my sales manager get the quotations and the delivery dates for you as soon as possible. We'll contact you later today at your hotel. Which hotel are you staying at, Mr Fisher? The Hilton. Goodbye, Mr Fisher. - A pleasure to meet you. - A pleasure to meet you, too. - Goodbye, Miss Brandt. - Goodbye, Mr Fisher. Kill him. Get down. 294 here. Tiger, immediate. Come in, 294. Zero-zero is with me. We are being chased by gunmen, in black sedan. I'm heading south for Highway Two, arrange usual reception, please. How's that for Japanese efficiency? Just a drop in the ocean. - Zero-zero? - Yes, Tiger. Report that Ning-Po is owned by Osato Chemicals, Tokyo. That fits. Go on. Vessel at present, loading in Kobe docks. Sailing for Shanghai at 5pm this afternoon. Suggest you proceed Kobe immediately to look her over. - Can we make it? - Yes, just. Proceeding immediately, Kobe docks, Tiger, contact M. Tell him to send Little Nellie. Repeat, Little Nellie. Suggest she'd be accompanied by her father. - Most urgent, understood? - Understood. Condensation ice-cold, liquid oxygen. (shouting in Japanese) Get out of here, contact Tanaka. I'm not leaving you. Tell him keep that ship shadowed wherever she goes. Go now. Take him to Number 11. - Wake him up. - Are you finished? Where am I? You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po. Leave him to me now, wait in there and shut the door. I've got you now. Well, enjoy yourself. - Who are you working for? - Empire Chemicals, you know that. - Do all their people carry guns? - When they're abroad, yes. And why were you snooping around the docks? I like ships and I used to be a sailor. You are a liar. - Do you know what this is? - I'd rather not. Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome. They use it to slice off skin. I hope you won't force me to use it. Now, what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this? - I have a confession to make. - What? Actually, I'm a spy. I know that. I suppose you know that industrial secrets are big business? Well, I've stolen Osato's new process for making monosodium glutamate. And... Well, it's worth $300,000? So? Well, I'll split it with you if you'll get me out of here and back to Tokyo. Is a nice offer. - How about it? - I'm afraid not. Why? Osato would kill me. We could fly to Europe tomorrow, you and I. Oh, the things I do for England. Now, you are going to need some very close protection tonight in Tokyo because, well that's when they'll try and get at you. You'll need the best man we've got. And who do you suggest? Well, me. I'm afraid I have another appointment tonight, Mr Fisher. I'm awfully sorry to leave you but I have to get off. Chasing girls will be the end of you, Bond-San, I have told you before. He didn't chase her, he did it so I could get away. He wouldn't touch that horrible girl. - You wouldn't, would you? - Heaven forbid. - Any progress? - Yes. We have identified the coastline in the photograph. It is an island called Matsu and lays in the direct route between Kobe and Shanghai. We shadowed the Ning-Po in a helicopter. - Did it stop at the island? - I think so. It was a very dark night. Impossible to see her all the time. But we know she stopped somewhere, look at these. That one we took last night. And that one, early this morning. - Notice, please, the water line. - You're right. Fully laden here and empty here. I want to take a fast look at the island now. - Has Little Nellie arrived yet? - Yes, and her father. Good. Welcome to Japan Dad. Is my little girl hot and ready? Look 007, I've had a long and tiring journey, probably to no purpose. And I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips. I have much curiosity, Bond-San. What is Little Nellie? Oh, she's a wonderful girl. Very small, quite fast. - Can do anything, just your type. - A toy helicopter? No, it's certainly not a toy, you'll see. We've made one or two improvements since you used her last. I'll give you the drill. This can only be for children. Don't use it, Bond-San. Take my helicopter instead. Right, now pay attention. - Two machine guns, fixed. - Synchronised to what? 100 yards and using incendiaries and high explosives. Two rocket launchers. - Forward-firing on either side. - Fine. Now, these fire heat-seeking air-to-air missiles, 60 a minute. Good. Flame guns, two of them. Firing astern. What range? 80 yards. Two smoke ejectors next door. Aerial mines. Now remember, use them only when directly above target. That's about the lot, I think. You know the rest, don't you? Yes. Cine camera. Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles. Good luck, Bond-San. I'll contact you when I get over the island. Be careful, Bond-San. Hello Base One, I'm over the island now. Have seen the fishing village. Nothing to report. Ok, we'll keep listening. Hello, Base One. There's nothing here but volcanoes. Understood. Carry on. - Hello Base One. - Listening. Little Nellie got a hot reception. Four big-shots made improper advances toward us, But she defended her honour with great success. - Heading for home. - Do not come home, Bond-San. Russian space shot imminent. Proceed vector 4-6 degrees and await instructions. - Understood? - Roger and out. Tri, dva, edin. Shiganya. (speaks Russian) (Russian) Clear the area. Clear the area. (announcements in Japanese) Prepare for reception. Prepare for reception. Radar blackout is now complete. Radar blackout is now complete. (Japanese) Moscow radio is already saying that we did it. The president is called a press conference for 2 P.M. He'll deny emphatically we have anything to do with it. - But can we prove it? - Of course we can't. The world isn't going to believe the Russians destroy their own spacecraft. And now they'll use the excuse to shoot down our next Jupiter. Houston to Washington, we followed him for one orbit, now he's gone off the screen. That means he's coming down. Yeah, but where? Some place in Russia. It has to be. The British theory about Japan is nonsense. - Forget Japan. - I agree. We've re-photographed every square inch. Ventilator fans to full power. Open all air ducts. Area safe to enter. All crews to stations. All air ducts to normal. Air ducts opened. - Close crater. - Closing crater. Fire guards to station. (Japanese) Ventilator fans to normal. Open shutters. Reception complete. Withdraw captive spaceship. Guards to stations. - Remove the prisoners. - Remove the prisoners. I shall be in my apartment. I may send for you later. (shouting in Japanese) I must congratulate you, gentlemen, upon your superb equipment. We congratulate you, sir, upon the way you handle it. Our clients are satisfied with the progress so far? My government is quite satisfied. Good. Hans. You will see that my piranha fish get very hungry. They can strip a man to the bone in 30 seconds. I have decided to ask for a little money in advance. I want the sum of 100 million dollars in gold bullion... deposited in our account in Buenos Aires. Our agreement states quite clearly that no money should be paid until war is broken out between Russia and the United States. - This is extortion. - Extortion is my business. Go and think it over gentlemen, I'm busy. Osato and Number 11, report now. An unknown Englishman was in your office the other day. Correct, Number One. - Do you know what gun this is? - Walther PPK. Only one person we know uses this sort of gun. James Bond. - But Bond is dead. - It was in all the newspapers. Rubbish. Bond is alive. Unless you killed him, Mr Osato? Don't tell me you let him go. I gave Number 11 the strictest orders to eliminate him. - And did she? - She failed. You should've killed him Osato, you had plenty of opportunity. This organisation does not tolerate failure. - I know, but you see I... - Go. Well? Osato. Kill Bond, now. Yes number One, yes, yes. - Hello. - Bad news from outer space. Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians are accusing the Americans. Next time it will be war. We'll have to get down to the volcanoes. I agree. We'll also need a company of first-rate men. Do you have any commandos here? I have much, much better. Ninjas. Top-secret, Bond-San. This is my ninja training school. Ninjas? The art of concealment and surprise, Bond-San. This must develop very fast reflex actions. And spiritual strength. Now, we will see some modern ninjas. My plan is this. I make a base on the Ama island. 100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen. They will be workers and fishermen. - What about me? - Later. But for the moment, these will interest you, rocket guns. Very powerful. See the holes in the back for jet propulsion. - It's a fine gun. - All rocket guns. This is our special baby rocket. It's very useful for people who smoke too many cigarettes like you. - Accurate up to 30 yards. - Very neat. It can save your life, this cigarette. You sound like a commercial. - Now, what's the plan for me? - First, you become a Japanese. Second, you train hard and quickly to become a ninja like us. And third, to give you extra-special cover, you take a wife. Regretfully impossible. You must marry Ama girl. One who is known on the island. - Is she pretty? - She has a face like a pig. - To hell with that idea. - But this is duty. The girl I have chosen is an agent of mine. But first, you must become Japanese. (Japanese) - Eyepieces for Hera. - Eyepieces for Hera. (Japanese) Why don't you just dye the parts that show? (Japanese) - Konbanwa. - Konbanha. Tiger said, from now on, you must do everything in Japanese-style. Everything? Good for Tiger. I'm... I... Aki. I'm... (Japanese) She's dead. Poisoned. Tiger, we must get to that island. You're almost ready. Just two more days training. (Japanese) - You killed him. - Yeah, he tried to kill me. This man is a stranger from outside. It's lucky we're getting out of here. Just tomorrow you'll be a poor Japanese worker with humble Japanese wife at your side. Yeah, with a face like a pig. My men are already ashore, all over the island. We have four days left. It is not much time. (Japanese) This is my house. My friend has made us some food. Do you live here alone? Yes, my parents are dead. Sit down, please. Oysters. - Is this the only room there is? - Yes. That is your bed. I shall sleep over there. - We're supposed to be married. - Think again, please. You gave false name to priest. Yes, but we must keep up appearances, we're on our honeymoon. No honeymoon, this is business. I won't need these. - Bond-San. - What's wrong? The Americans have changed the launching date. The countdown has already started. The president has spoken on TV he's given a last warning to the Russians. - When does it go up? - Tonight, midnight. Our time. Did your men search the island? Yes, there is nothing except volcanoes. Everything is so normal around here. - Nothing happens. - One thing has happened. Yesterday an Ama girl rowed her boat into Ryuzaki. Ryuzaki? It is a big cave on the mainland. And when her boat floated out again... she was dead. Was that the funeral we saw yesterday? Yes. - How did she die? - Nobody knows. - Can you take me to this cave? - Yes. We'll slip away from the fishing fleet in the morning. All right? Now, where is this cave? It's straight across. The cave is over there. Gas, get over the side. Quick. Phosgene gas, to keep the visitors away. You noticed the sulphur on the walls? - The yellow? - Yes. It was once an underground outlet for the lava from the volcano. - There must be a long tunnel. - Miles of it. It leads all the way, right up to the top there. That's where we'll have to go next, you think you can make it? Of course. It's business. Good. - May I rest a moment? - Surely. It's hard work. Some honeymoon. It's going down, into the volcano. Heliport to position. The honeymoon is over, come on. (announcements in Japanese) This volcano isn't active, is it? It never has been, not in my lifetime. There's been some terrific heat here recently. What happened to the helicopter? It's down there somewhere. Come on. Stand by. Mark. Stand by for ten-second countdown. 10, 9, 8... All units through out the world will remain in instant readiness so long as the spacecraft is in orbit. 3, 2, 1. Ignition. This is it, gentlemen. All we can do now is wait and pray. - Is that deep? - They usually are, very. It's metal, wait here. Heliport to take-off position. Open crater. Emergency crews to stations. Get back to Tanaka, tell him to come with every man he's got. Yes. Heliport to standby position. (announcements continue in Japanese) Astronauts to dressing rooms. Astronauts to dressing rooms. Attention, attention. American target vehicle is now in orbit. Interception will take place in two hours time. Washington, this is Houston. Houston to Washington. Our vehicle is now 120 nautical miles altitude, 170 miles downrange. Jupiter to Houston, we now have second phase. Roger, Jupiter. You're now four hours 36 minutes into the mission. - Can you give us a time, Mac? - Roger. Connect the igniter cable. Connect the igniter cable. (guards speak Japanese) Radar technicians to report to control room. Radar technicians to report to control room. T minus 100 minutes and counting. You guys volunteer for astronaut training? In our country, we say cosmonaut. Yes, the both of us. Yes, been within six months since we started training. Good evening. Who the hell are you? Stand back, I'm going to blow the lock. Stand back. Get into their uniforms. Astronauts have two minutes. Repeat, two minutes. Reserve astronaut to stand by. - Lock on target. - Lock on target vehicle. Check secondary guidance. Launch time is now T minus 90 minutes and counting. - Astronauts to launching pad. - Astronauts to launching pad. Repeat, astronauts to launching pad immediately. Astronauts to launching pad. Astronauts to launching pad. Stop that astronaut, bring him to me. Stop that astronaut. Summon the reserve astronaut. Reserve astronaut to launching pad. Reserve astronaut to launching pad, immediately. Re-coordinate with target vehicle. A new update with target vehicle has been received from computers. We now have T minus seven minutes and counting. You made a mistake my friend... no astronaut would enters the capsule carrying his air conditioner. Remove his helmet. James Bond, allow me to introduce myself. I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld. They told me you were assassinated in Hong Kong. Yes, this is my second life. You only live twice, Mr Bond. Target vehicle passing over central Russia, approaching Mongolia. Track is as predicted. All computers... As you see, I am about to inaugurate a little war. In a matter of hours, when America and Russia have annihilated each other, we shall see a new power dominating the world. - Target vehicle on scope. - Brief check on target vehicle. Remove his suit and search him. Reserve astronaut ready on Bird 1. - Reserve for firing. - Reserve for firing. Clear the area. Clear the area. Emergency services to stand by. Area now clear. T minus one minute, 30 seconds and counting. Re-coordinate with target vehicle. Bird 1 now in readiness. Astronauts ready on Bird. All systems are go. Close shutters. - Radar blackout commence. - Radar blackout in operation. Effective range, kilometres 800. - Open crater. - Opening crater. Crater opening. Bird 1 to lift-off position. Gimbal the engines. Pressurised tanks open. Ventilator fans to full power. 10 seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. Ignition. - Close crater. - Closing crater. Open shutters. (Japanese) Bird 1 to base, separation complete. Confirm acquisition. Calling Bird 1, you are 70 nautical miles downrange, 200 miles altitude. Hans, our job will soon be done. Blow them up as soon as they have captured the Americans. Here is the key to operate the exploder button. There are men in the crater. Men in the crater. - Crater guns, fire. - Crater guns, open fire. The firing power inside my crater is enough to annihilate a small army. You can watch it all on TV. It's the last program you're likely to see. Well, if I'm going to be forced to watch television, may I smoke? Yes, give him his cigarettes. It won't be the nicotine that kills you, Mr Bond. Armed guards to control room. - Close the crater. - Close crater. I shall look forward personally to exterminating you, Mr Bond. Close the shutters. We are now impregnable. Interception will take place in eight minutes, nothing can prevent that. - Impregnable? - (gives order in Japanese) Come with me, Mr Bond. Bird 1 to base. Locked on target. - Osato? - Yes, Number One? 76, confirm. Base calling Bird 1. You are to assume full control of operation from now on. Seven minutes to interception. Roger, Base One. Houston, this is Hawaii. We have an unidentified object on scope. Order first alert, arm all weapons. Interception will occur in six minutes. This is the price of failure, Mr Bond. Come on. Goodbye, Mr Bond. There's an exploder button up in the control room, we've got to get up there. Impossible, too well defended. Evacuate the control. (shouting in Japanese) Control room technicians. There must be another way up there. Give me cover till I get to the staircase. Bon appetite. Closing fast on our vehicle. Orbit identical. All units stand by for codeword. Codeword is imminent. I repeat, closing fast on our vehicle. Blown up, the enemy. I repeat, the enemy is blown up. All units will return to first alert. Codeword is not, I say again, not imminent. Tiger... we've done it. Down the tunnel. Steady. Now, about that honeymoon. Why not? But they'll never let you stay. But they'll never find us. Dinghy is on board, sir. Tell him to come below and report. It will be a pleasure, sir. ♪ You only live twice ♪ ♪ Or so it seems ♪ ♪ One life for yourself ♪ ♪ And one for your dreams ♪ ♪ You drift through the years ♪ ♪ And life seems tame ♪ ♪ Till one dream appears ♪ ♪ And love is its name ♪ ♪ And love is a stranger ♪ ♪ Who'll beckon you on ♪ ♪ Don't think of the danger ♪ ♪ Or the stranger is gone ♪ ♪ This dream is for you ♪ ♪ So pay the price ♪ ♪ Make one dream come true ♪ ♪ You only live twice ♪
