[♪] Order those immediately. Aye, aye, sir. Telegram, sir. Please wire my acceptance, lieutenant. But, admiral, Count Gehrol is suspected of being a spy. Exactly. That's why I'm going there. Perhaps I can trip him up. I see, sir. Here, take my uniforms down and have them pressed, and tell those dumb tailors not to burn holes in them this time. Aye, aye, sir. [HUMMING] You know, I'm getting sick and tired of this business. It was your bright idea. "Join the Navy and see the world. "No more smelly sweatshops, beautiful girls in every port." I got a good mind to punch you right in the nose. We'd still have been all right if you hadn't blabbed about us being tailors. Well, don't tailor sound like sailor? I got a good mind to bust this iron over your head. Hey, remember you had to pay for the last iron. Look. Look what you made me do to the captain's pants. Fix that hole. Hm. You know, gasoline don't taste so good since prohibition. What do you mean? 'Cause they ain't so careful like when they used it for making gin. But, it ain't bad. Here, taste it. Go on, scram, and get to work. I-- [STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS] Hey, fellas, it's 12:00. Come on. We got the afternoon off. Make way for a tailor, girls. I'm going to get 18 blondes and 12 redheads. I'm going rowing in the park. Hey, clean and press for the admiral, in a hurry. Clean and press for the admiral, in a hurry. Clean and press in a hurry. Clean and press in a-- Mm. Boy, wait till you see the dames go for me. You should see that bearded lady in the circus. Is she a beaut when she gets a shave. When I get through rowing a boat, boy, I'm going to spend a hot weekend on a roller coaster. Ha, ha. Now, I'm going to change my socks. What an experience. [YELLS] What's the matter? Nothing. I always wanted to see how you'd look with a permanent wave. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Attention. Why aren't you men at work? Well, you see, admiral, he and I were just standing-- How would I look as an admiral? Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Get him. [SQUEAKING] [BOTH GRUNT] I got him. Listen, listen, fellas. Hey, you, salute your superior officer. Oh. Oh. Why, you. No, this is a-- How dare you strike an officer! Certainly, how dare you. What do you mean, officer? Men, do your duty. [CHATTER] Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. You know, I was thinking-- Quiet! Psst. [MOUTHING INAUDIBLY] Ah, ah, ah. How dare you wear my uniform. I was taking it out for an airing. Oh, you were. I'll press them right away. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Is there anything wrong, sir? Yeah, there's a guy-- Everything's all right. I wish to talk to those men alone. Aye, aye, sir. [HUMMING] You know, for five bucks a piece I'll get you birds out. I'll bust your skull in five pieces. Get us out, you bubble brain. Say, guard, put these men on rations of bread and water. I'll get you for this. On second thought, plain water. Ooh. Salt water. Hey, you. Oh, admiral. Yes? All right. You win. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. You know, I was thinking, there's no sense in getting you guys out. You need a pass for the other gate. You chucklehead. Yours ain't the only officer's uniform in the tailor shop. You're right. Guard, release these men. But, sir, these men are in here for kicking an officer. Kicking an officer, eh? Yes, sir! You'll kick an officer? Oh. Kicking an officer, eh? Oh. Ah. Whoo. Attention. Right face. Forward march. My dear Count Gehrol, your admiral is late. Admiral Taylor and his staff. That's him now. That's not Admiral Taylor. Be careful, it may be a trap. Don't worry. I'll get the information if it's womanly possible. Admiral Taylor, I believe? How did you know I was a tailor? Why, everyone knows the Taylor's of Kentucky, one of the oldest families in America. Sure, everybody knows Old Taylor, 100 proof. Won't you introduce your friends? Why, certainly, this-- Commander Button. Captain Presser. That's them. Miss Olga, may I present Admiral Taylor, Commander Button and Captain Presser. Say, when do we eat? Oh. That's a nice hunk of goods there, buddy. Oh, admiral. Wouldn't you like to come and sit down? Would I? Let's go over and find a dark corner. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. It's the kid. The admiral threads a fast needle. He's an old so-and-so. Oh, girls, did you see my tattoo? There. Would you care for a cigar? Uh. Oh, allow me. Certainly. Certainly. Won't you tell me about the Navy? Sure. You see, they feed you beans every day except on Sunday, that's when you get bean soup, and beans. Oh, admiral, you're such a sturdy oak and I'm your clinging vine. Won't you tell me about your submarines? I don't know anything about submarines. I'm a tailor, I mean, uh-- Oh, admiral, don't you trust me? Sure, but I don't trust myself. You foolish boy. [CHATTERING] [SQUEALING] Please, sir. Come on, toots. Don't mind him. Nyuck, nyuck. Do you smell rubbish burning? Smells like somebody's frying onions. Heh, get up. Get up. Am I as heavy as all that? No, but I'm burning up. Get up. [YELLS] Well, is that nice? Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I didn't mean it, honest. Oh, please give me another chance, will you, please? I didn't-- Listen, honey, I didn't-- I didn't-- [LAUGHING] Say, you're gettin' in my hair. [SQUEALING] Ooh. Oh, oh, oh. You wanna get us in wrong before we eat? What's the matter with you? I think I got spring fever. Or hay fever? You gotta get that off before anyone sees you. Get out there and I'll help. [GRUNTING] Oh. I ought to-- MAN: You better show me. I tell you I am Admiral Taylor. I beg your pardon, there must be some mistake. The admiral has been here for quite some time. I thought this guy was a phony when I caught him snooping around outside the window. Now, just a minute, gentlemen. Those three imposters can identify me. They're enlisted men. Tell these men who I am. How should we know? We never saw you before in our lives. What! Just as I thought. Come on, bozo, let's go. Now, officer, please, I-- We'll be shot at sunrise for this. Maybe the sun won't come out tomorrow. It might rain. We gotta find a place to hide. This plays right into our hands. How about that submarine, admiral? Submarine? Why, certainly. That's perfect. That is, I mean, uh-- What are we waiting for? Ooh. Ooh. Calling all patrol boats, calling all patrol boats. Submarine M-9 has left port unauthorized. MAN [OVER RADIO]: Last seen headed out to sea. Stop her, that is all. Hm, see. I told you you couldn't get away with it. My government needs this submarine and I'll either get it to them or sink in the attempt. Well, what about us? One move out of you and I'll kill you. If you do I'll never talk to you again. Ah. [THUDS] Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Thanks, mouse. Stick 'em up. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Oh. You-- Hold still, Moe. I'll get him. Hold him in one place. Hold him still. Hold him, I got him. Oh. Oh. [YELLS] Wait a minute. I hit the wrong guy. You made a mistake. Oh, yes. Yes, I did. LARRY: I didn't mean to hit you. Well, suppose I did. [CHATTER] You can't get away with this. No one can trifle with me. No one-- Rope, so tie 'em up. I did it. I did it. Hurry up. [SCUFFLING] What happened? We must have hit land. I'll see. We hit bottom. We're sunk. We're lost. [PANTING] Hey, what's the matter with you? I'm practicing for when we run out of air. Oh, you think you are in the movies? We're trapped like rats. Speak for yourself. Oh, a microscope. I can see. I can see. BOTH: What? What do you see? Water. Why-- [MEOWING] What was that? A school of catfish just went by. Meow, meow. [PANTING, BARKING] Hey, bloodhound. Hey, bloodhound. Get to your post. What post? I don't see no post, not a street lamp. I'll put both your lamps out. [YELLING] [MUTTERING] Calling all battleships, calling all Navy planes. Calling all bombers. Calling all Naval craft. Submarine M-9 stolen by enemy spies. Sink her at all cost. That is all. That is all? Ain't that enough? We'd better get this thing back before they find us. Right. Man the wheel. What wheel? Any wheel. Whoo-whoo-whoo. [SUBMARINE POWERING UP] Hey, fellas, we're moving. I can feel it in my bones. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nycuk, nyuck. [CREAKING] I'll level her off. Pardon, sir, submarine M-9 was sighted just off the breakwater. Order batteries 1 and 6 to open fire at once. Yes, sir. [CANNON FIRE] It's running smooth. I'm going to get out of here. Okay! Hey, fellas, it's all right. [CANNON FIRE] Mm. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Hey. [BARKING] Cease firing and order my gig. I'm going to board that sub. Yes, sir. Look what they did to the flag. But they were shooting at me-- Whoa. What did you catch, kid? A pelican. That's an aerial bomb, you sap. Wait a minute. This can't hurt any of us, it's a dud. Oh, a dud, eh? Wait a minute. What are you trying to do? I'll fix it so it don't hurt anybody. I'll beat its brains out. MAN: Halt. You'll be court-martialled for this. Arrest these traitors. Oh, now, wait a minute, sir. We're no traitors. We captured those spies. We did it for you, sir. Oh, remarkable. You'll be rewarded for this. How did you do it? It was cinch, admiral. I took a piece of pipe and crowned them like this. [EXPLOSION] [♪] Hey, step on it. Look who's coming. [ALL YELLING]
