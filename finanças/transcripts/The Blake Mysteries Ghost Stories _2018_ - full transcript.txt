Whoa! Righto, your turn. Line up. Now, we make a little nest. Does anyone know why? To trap the spark. It make it light easier. That's right. Geoffrey? Aren't you supposed to be with your dad on the archery range? I've already got that badge. Can't I just stay here, please? Alright. Is everyone watching? Now remember... strike away from yourself. The boy never saw his sister again. But sometimes, you could still hear her, singing her lullaby, to come and play down at the bottom of the well! Hahaha! That's dumb. You didn't even say if there was any blood or not. Yeah! Tell us about the Stanton House. Oh-ho, no, no, no, I'm not having any nightmares while we're out here. We're not babies. No one's gonna have nightmares, right, Geoff? Ah, what about you, Mr Roper? You'll tell us about the murders, right? - Well, the truth is that... - The truth is, it's late. Oh! If you still want to know about that place, we can go there in the morning, on a hike. Aw! Goodnight, Scouts. Goodnight, Scoutmaster. Scoutmaster, um, can you come check my tent? Make sure I do it properly? I'll do it. Goodnight, boys. Let's head to bed, too. Come on. Shh! You have to take something. From the bedroom upstairs. Right past where the old lady killed herself. What if I don't want to? Then you're a dead man. Dead man! Dead man! ARGH! Scoutmaster! Scoutmaster! Geoffrey! Where's Evan? What are you doing up? Ah, the house! You've gotta come see. Please, Dad. Keep up, boys. Wait. Over there. What? What is it now? Wait here, boys. What's... what's that? What's that down there? Oi! What do you think you're doing? And just repeating, less than 24 hours after the assassination of the President of the United States of America, John F Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald has been shot. The 24 year old... I can't believe he walked right up to him and shot him. Extraordinary news. Well, some kind of justice, I s'pose. Oh, it's not justice. Not without answers. Is there anything I can do, Jean? No, I'm fine. I need to get to a meeting. Blake residence. I wonder what happened to the Scoutmaster? - I'm gonna miss going... - Wonder what happened to him? Superintendent, this is Don Roper and his wife, Brenda. Chief Superintendent Lawson. Their son, Geoffrey, found the victim. You'd be the bravest Boy Scout in Ballarat, Geoffrey. I'm sorry, Geoffrey's deaf in that ear. He lost his hearing last year. Complications from the measles. You'll be alright, son. Doctor. Lovely morning for it. Chief Superintendent. What is he doing? Excuse me! You can't touch the body until the Police Surgeon or a superior officer grants you permission. Constable Peter Crowe, this is Doctor Alice Harvey. It's in the handbook. Haven't you ever been to a murder scene before? No, actually. This is my first. Oh. Well. My apologies, then. But don't touch anything. Constable Crowe, why don't you go back to camp and given Sergeant Hobart a hand. This is Evan Butson, 21 years old. He's the Scoutmaster of the troop. He was found at two o'clock this morning. Who reported it? One of the dads, a Mr Roper. He had to hike to the nearest house. He used the phone. All he could tell us was someone had been shot. These don't look like gunshot wounds to me. More like stab wounds. Any chance they could be from arrows? I'll know more once I've completed the autopsy. We're not finished yet. Last question, Mrs Blake. Do you know if he was meeting anyone else before you? I have no idea, Bill. I'm sorry. Jean, what are you doing here? Well, this was my morning meeting. His name's Glen Holland. How well did you know him? Oh, not at all. I know he's been buying up properties over the last few years for redevelopment. He left a message for me yesterday to meet him here this morning at eight o'clock. Strange place for a meeting. Do you know what he wanted? I have no idea. There's a strong smell of alcohol. Perhaps it was an accidental fall. Doc, the ambos right to move the other body once they're done here? Yes, thank you Sergeant. What other body? Some kids found the Scoutmaster, Evan Butson, dead at their camp. Evan Butson? Evan Butson's mother is the tea lady at the town hall. Oh, poor Maggie. You don't think there's some connection between him and Glen? Any reason you can think of that they'd want both of them dead? No, nothing springs to mind. Right, we'd better find the poor little bugger that found Mr Holland, then. Oh sorry, Super, didn't I tell you? It's OK, darling. You remember Mrs Blake. You used to come to my husband's surgery when you were unwell. What happened to your Scoutmaster? Evan... ... he told us a ghost story before we went to bed. I couldn't sleep. You don't like scary stories. In books I do. Like... the Haunting of Hill House. But outside, at night, well it's different. You've read Shirley Jackson? Mm. What about Edgar Allen Poe? He's a bit old fashioned for me. Geoffrey, when you found the man in the house, did you see anyone else, or hear anyone talking? I couldn't see anyone. I ran back here, fast as I could. We found the body probably five minutes later. Mr Roper, the other Scouts told us that you weren't in your tent after Geoffrey got back. I was outside having a smoke. Geoffrey probably ran past me in the dark. Don, did you have much to do with Evan? No, not really. This is the first camp I've come on. Mrs Roper, Constable Crowe will take you and your son back home. Your husband will have to come down to the station with me to answer a few questions. Perhaps I should tell my father you're taking my husband to the station? I'm sure he'll be interested. Ah, there's no need to involve the Mayor, but that's up to you of course. I have to tell Mrs Butson about her boy. - Do you think you could... - Yes, of course, Matthew. Did your son have any enemies, Mrs Butson? - Anyone that... - No. Of course not. And when was the last time you saw him? Yesterday morning. He kissed me goodbye like he always does. He did. I made up some Anzac biscuits. He wanted to give them to the boys, but I knew he loved them. He told... oh! He said he needed to go to the police station after he got back. Did he say why? No, I... I just thought it was something to do with the Scouts. Mrs Butson, if you're ready you'll have to come with me to the hospital to identify him. I can come with you, if you like. No, it's alright. You've got enough on your plate. All rise for the Honourable Bruce Beattie. A moment's silence, gentlemen, for President Kennedy. Mr Roper, we've heard you're handy with a bow and arrow. Not much difference in sighting a bow or a rifle. The army taught me that much at least. I showed off for the lads a little. There's no point in teaching them how to do something if they can't do it well. Had you been to that campground before? Yes, but not in decades. Geoffrey only joined the Scouts last year. I thought it'd be good for him. Get his head out of those bloody books. How well did you know Evan Butson? Look, Superintendent, I've told you what you need to know. I'm not certain pursuing how well I did or didn't know Evan Butson is the best use of your time. I'm not sure others would think so, either. You own that nursery near Soldiers Hill, correct? That's right. Wasn't Evan one of the gardeners who helped you set the place up? Fine. I knew him. Enough to know he wasn't as squeaky clean as everyone thought. Is that so? I'll tell you this much for nothing. The bloke was no Boy Scout. The first shot exited cleanly through ribs eight and nine posteriorly. The second struck the aorta, causing a serious internal bleed. That's your probable cause of death, isn't it, Scoutmaster Butson? The shape of the entrance wounds suggests trefoil arrows. But your scouts were using arrows with rounded heads. Oh, Constable Crowe, what are you doing here? Um, the boss sent me down. To assist. He said ah, maybe I'd learn something. Stop smiling. Is this just dirt and grass? On his clothes, I mean. I won't know until I run some tests. And these were in his pocket? Yes. Why do you ask? Two sets of keys. You don't think that's a bit... Please don't feel compelled to stay, Constable. Nah. Gotta get used to this sort of thing sometime, right? They can't treat us like this, Dad. It's appalling. I know, darling, but look, they're the police. Mrs Blake. Those files you asked for on the Stanton House. Oh, thank you. It's Livie, isn't it? Yes, Mrs Blake. Livie, you took a message for me yesterday from a Mr Glen Holland, didn't you? Yeah. And when you spoke to him, what did he say, do you remember? Well he said he had to see you. He wanted to meet you at the Stanton House. Anything else? He said that there was something he needed to give you. - Well, thank you, Livie. - Let's go to my office. Now, our second body. Mr Holland's cause of death was almost certainly this ring fracture at the base of his skull. Constable? Ah, does this mean anything? Well spotted. That is fingertip bruising, meaning he was probably dragged by someone shortly before he... Constable, could I trouble you to help me turn him over, please? Is this really how you check for bruising on the spine? Sometimes. It can appear in the deep muscles internally before it shows on the skin. No bruising. But significant damage to the lower back there. In a kind of stripe. Yeah, right there. That's bad? That is a spinal haematoma. Mr Holland would have been paralysed from the waist down. Could he have done that in the fall? I don't think he fell. Mrs Blake! Peter! I'm not supposed to be here, am I? Anyone asks, we'll just say you were helping me search for evidence. Ha. What are you looking for, anyway? Well apparently Mr Holland had something to give me. You didn't find anything, did you? Like what? Well I'm not sure, actually. Doctor Harvey thinks someone whacked Mr Holland in the back. Paralysed him before he went over. I see. Maybe it was the ghost. Oh, you've heard the stories? It all started with the Stantons. They made their money in gold. But there was a terrible cave in in one of the mines in the early 1800s, and Mrs Stanton lost everyone. Her husband, her sons. Not long after, she hanged herself from that landing there. And the house has been empty ever since. Is there a haunted house where you're from, Peter? Just outside of Serpentine. My brothers used to hide in there and scare me. Maybe Glen wasn't hit with something. These marks are fresh. He had a buckle on the back of his trousers. - It'd be about the right height. - Mmm. Maybe he was pushed into that post there so hard he was incapacitated. Someone drags him by the arms... Mm, and throws the poor man over to finish him off. You've done this sort of thing before? Hmm? Oh, once or twice. Arghh! Ohh! Oh! Best you calm down, mate. You were in my home! You... you can't. It's not allowed. Rightio. If you were home last night, then you'd know someone was killed inside, yes? Trespassers need to be dealt with, yes? Oh. - What's your name? - John. Stanton. John Ellis Stanton. Ellis. Two Ls. Is there anyone we can contact for you, Mr Stanton, to let them know you're here? Your parents? Family? Surely there's someone we can call... No. No. Maybe not now, Doctor. Of course. You're alright. Doctor, can I have a word? You're the lady, aren't you? The one I... you're the one I nearly fell on, yeah? I am, yes. I'm really sorry. It's alright. I'm Jean. And you're John. Everyone just calls me Jack. Jack Stanton. Jack. I have a son named Jack. What's wrong with him? Well, he's suffering from malnutrition. Scurvy. Possible leptospirosis from rat's urine and droppings, which could explain mania. You... you've got something. - Hm? - Just... just there. Oh. - Poor man. - That poor man may have killed two people. Oh, I don't know. Even if he killed Glen for trespassing, why would he kill a Scoutmaster? Still playing detective, Jean? A word, please. You couldn't have told me you were going back to that house? I was perfectly safe. Constable Crowe was with me the whole time. And I found this. A piece of string. Boss, I checked with Mrs Butson. She's confirmed the keys we found in Evan's pocket aren't his. Any other link between Evan and Glen, apart from them somehow being connected to the council? Nothing yet. Holland was a widower, big house. Bit of a dodgy operator, apparently, so I went down to the Colony Club... Colonists. Why? Bloke had more money than god. Seemed like the private club type. Anyway, the barman said that he was there last night hitting the bottle pretty hard. It was probably for a bit of Dutch courage, yeah? You know, Holland, as in the... And by the time he left he was so pi... ... drunk, that they wouldn't let him drive home. So he walked all the way out to the Stanton House ahead of our morning meeting? What was he doing, stumbling around in the dark at that hour? Well, it wouldn't be the first time that someone's done something stupid while they were extremely drunk. So what are you waiting for? Pat on the head? Your crazy friend in there is looking more and more likely to be our man. Oh, Matthew, I don't think he's crazy, I just think he's unwell. Any chance that he could actually be a Stanton? I don't know of any surviving relatives. Suits me. Matthew. Do you think it's a coincidence a death in the Stanton House so soon after the story in the paper? Hell of a woman. She's next to her husband when he's murdered. Watches the new President sworn in with his blood still on her clothes. Is there something I can help you with, Chief Superintendent? Actually there is, Mr Carver. Oh, it's Martin, please. If this is about the editorial I ran on your Police Force... It's not. ... because it was all true. The rate you've been closing cases has significantly diminished since your previous Police Surgeon disappeared. ... walks his last miles. His assailant moves in from the right. He's been shot. He's been shot. There's been a murder here at the Stanton House. You did an article on the history of the place less than a month ago. I did. It was part of a series. One of four, actually. On? Unsolved crimes in Ballarat. The town's dark history, as it were. People actually are interested in that stuff, are they? Well, seeing as it's been reprinted in our new owner's papers all across the country, I'd say yes. We've asked people to contact us if they have any new information. I assumed that any help would have been gratefully received, considering. I'll need copies of those articles. Goodbye, Mr Carter. ... at the same hospital where President Kennedy died, doctors worked to save his life. - But 48 hours... - It's Martin. ... after the President's death, his accused slayer is dead. I thought Doctor Spencer told you no more smoking? Cigarettes. I'm compromising. Those my autopsy reports? And toxicology. Ah, Glen Holland. Was extremely inebriated. And Evan Butson. Marijuana. That is a problem we don't need. There's a few more tests to see if it's in his bloodstream. I've never ordered them before. Ah, 'The Birds' is playing tonight at the pictures... Matthew, I've told you. We can't. Look, if this is about you becoming Police Surgeon... I don't want people to think that's why you offered it to me in the first place. I should be getting back. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. Oh. You're still here, Jean? Maggie, I thought you were staying at home. I'd, ah, rather be back here. The house just seems... Empty? Matthew, hello? Anybody there? - AH! - Wait wait wait wait! Mr Carver. What are you doing here? That's quite an outfit. I was on my way to a play at The George. The articles you asked for. You didn't see anyone outside? I was somewhat distracted by the frying pan being swung at my head. Saucepan. Maybe you didn't see anyone because you were the one who broke in in the first place. You think that I would waste perfectly good theatre tickets? Mrs Blake? I've searched the property and spoken to the neighbours. You sure there's nothing missing? Oh, it's a bit of a mess in there, but no no, I don't think so. The studio's only really used for storage these days. The only other damage I can see is they've busted your side fence. I could fix it for you if you'd like. Really? Oh, thank you. Constable Crowe, show Mr Carver out. 'Night, Mrs Blake. - Ah, Jean. - Right, sorry. Ah, Mr Carver? I'm sorry once again for the, ah... It was probably just kids. Breaking into the house where the Chief Superintendent lives? I'm fine, Matthew, really. Well there's not much more that can be done tonight. Goodnight, Jean. Goodnight. After yesterday's occasional light showers, expect a clearer day today... Do you know why they're called police files? Hmm? I spoke to Maggie Butson again last night. She's got nothing left now that Evan's gone. Do we really need to tell her about the... - Marijuana? - Mm. This is serious business, Jean. Obviously he's not the man she thought he was. Yes, but does she really need to know that? I mean, where does someone even get marijuana in Ballarat? I have no idea. Old man Flaherty's been crying over Kennedy since Saturday. He's celebrating today. Amy, you knew Evan Butson, didn't you? Once upon a time. Evan was murdered last night. He was here Saturday night. The night before he... Was he alone? He left around nine with some fella who had a bit too much to drink. Evan was a bit of a do-gooder, but he was nice enough. Do they know who killed him? No, not yet. So what's the real reason you're here, then? Look, I know this is awkward, but, um... ... do you know where somebody might buy some marijuana? It was nice to see you, Jean. Do me a favour? Try not to come around here again. Amy, just one more question. Who was it that Evan Butson left with the other night? Steven Whelan was with Evan the night before he died at Flaherty's Pub. How do I know that name? He's the one in The Courier story about the drownings. Oh, yes. Two kids died. Yes. Three of them took a boat down to the river. Steven fell asleep on the bank. He woke to hear the girl calling for help. The boat had capsized and the two of them were being dragged down by the current. Apparently... Well, he tried to jump off the rail bridge years ago. I don't remember hearing about that. His mother said he never got over it. We were in the CWA together. Matthew, I think Steven knew why Evan was going to go to the police. And all this information just fell into your lap, did it? Well, I have an anonymous source who I promised wouldn't get into trouble. Well if your anonymous source has done nothing wrong, then they've got nothing to worry about. Alright, but you can't leap to conclusions. - It's Amy Parkes. - Oh! As in Danny's sister? As in repeat juvenile offender. Please, Matthew, she's doing really well. She's got a job. I don't want to ruin things for her. Bring in Steve Whelan. And I'm not making any promises on Amy Parkes, understand? Hang on, Sarge. Just a tick. We found these on Evan Butson. Stop smiling. Arghh! What are you doing? What are you doing in my house? Yeah, of course I've seen the article. Not every day someone accuses you of murder. Who said anything about murder? That's what everyone thinks. People made up stories. Said we had a fight the day before. We were just kids. I woke up and Sarah was screaming. Toby had already gone under, the current had got him. And then she disappeared. I froze. I thought they'd come back up again. But then I ran for help, but it was too late. And everyone thought you could have saved them, didn't they, Mr Whelan? Do you have any idea how that feels? This town, it never lets you forget. And now I can't eat, can't sleep, can't work. And I heard someone, out the back, by the bins. Someone's watching me. And Evan Butson? What about him? You were seen leaving a lock-in with him at Flaherty's at approximately 9.15pm on the night that he died and you were very drunk. And he had your keys in his possession. Yeah. He walked me home. Probably took my keys after he'd let me in. As you say, I was very drunk. Or maybe it wasn't just the alcohol? Look, I let myself get talked into buying... something. They said it'd help calm me down. Who sold you the marijuana, Mr Whelan? So, you're not going to tell us where you got it, or who you sold it to? Nothing? I don't know what you're talking about. This is serious, Amy. You are one step away from going to prison. Doctor, perhaps you could explain to Miss Parks the dangers of marijuana, medically speaking? Well, medically speaking, I'm not entirely sure there are any. Take her to the cells. Pending charges. Possession. It can't be possession if I don't have any, can it? Charge Steve Whelan, too. Come on, Amy. No, I realise that, Miss. It'd only take... Mm, who's that? Thanks anyway. We're going to need more copies of those articles. There seems to be some sort of connection between two of the stories. Let's see if there's more. Here, boss. I went past The Courier offices after we brought Whelan in. So you've read them? Well? So we already know about two of the stories: the haunted house and those drownings. The third one's on a house fire about 35 years ago. Killed a married couple, made orphans of their two young kids. The article says that they left Ballarat. And the last one's on a teenager murdered in 1951. He was out with his girlfriend on Lovers Lane. That's one of Ballarat's strangest unsolved mysteries? Yeah, the girlfriend told anyone who'd listen the killer had a hook for a hand. You don't forget a case like that. Ah, so this girlfriend in Lovers Lane, Diana Zurvas, she still in Ballarat? Yeah, I just got off the phone from her. I figured since Steve Whelan said he saw someone prowling around outside his house I'd see if she had... had, as well. You'll let us know when you've solved this case, won't you, Constable? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Definitely, yeah. What did Miss Zurvas have to say? Oh, not much. I offered to go round, but she rang off pretty quickly. Didn't seem like she wanted anything to do with the police. Diana won't talk to the police. Perhaps she'll be more inclined to speak to the Police Surgeon. Thanks a lot. That pig Flaherty sacked me. And the cops think I'm a drug dealer. Thanks to you. So it wasn't you selling the drugs then? That's not the point. Do me a favour. Leave me alone, alright? - Amy... - No. Don't you get it? I don't want your help. Amy. That's fine. But the path you're on, you and I both know it's not going to end well. Jean! Is this a bad time? No. I wondered if I might ask you a favour. I don't like to talk about that day. Obviously. Obviously. Diana, the article said that you don't often leave the house. No. I suffer from agoraphobia. Diagnosed? Every time I left the house, it felt like I couldn't breathe. Eventually, I just stopped going out altogether. Fascinating. The paper also said you were undergoing some sort of treatment to help you remember what happened. I'm so sorry. I forgot to ask if I could get you both anything. A cup of tea? A mint? Diana, we're only here to make sure that you're alright. You're not in any kind of trouble. That's right. I couldn't arrest someone even if I wanted to. You haven't seen or heard anything unusual in the past few days? Nothing. This new therapy, Miss Zurvas, how does it actually work? It's meant to chemically open up pathways to repressed memories. Chemically. Using psilocybin, you mean? Yes. I've started to remember things. Flashes. Flashes of... ? The man who killed Tony. He didn't have a hook, I understand that now. But there was something. It's like trying to look through fog, or a dream. But perhaps when I remember, I can finally be free. Well, that went well didn't it? Yes, it did. Thank you, Jean. I never could have done that without you. Oh, rubbish. You're much better at this than you think you are. So Diana doesn't seem to have any link to anyone else in those articles. No. But how fascinating psilocybin is being used to unlock memory. I wonder if maybe the Council is still the link? - Glen Holland wanted to meet with me. - She's gonna learn. - I'm a Councillor. - Tell her. Evan Butson's mother, Maggie, works at the Town Hall. Or am I just clutching at straws? Excuse me, ladies. This is a gentlemen's club. Women are only welcome in the presence of a male member. I'm sorry. Doctor Harvey is Ballarat's Police Surgeon, and I'm an elected Councillor. I don't believe we need a chaperone. Rules are rules. I think that will be quite enough, sir. Ah, drink ma'am? No thank you, Cec. I have somewhere else I need to be. Gentlemen. Careful you don't burn your mouth. Don't care. I like homemade food. I'm afraid I bought that, but I'll try to bring something in that's homemade. Apple and rhubarb pie, please. I love... Mr Stanton and Mrs Blake. He's a friend. I was wondering if I might get some fingerprints. I had to release one of his hands so he could eat. Mr Stanton, you said to one of my officers... It's alright, it's alright. You said to one of my officers yesterday that you might remember something about the man who died on the stairs. You must have seen or heard something. I didn't really get... I only saw bits. Bits and pieces. Bits and pieces of what? The bad man. He was wearing odd clothes, not normal people clothes. Councillor Blake. Gentlemen. Give me a minute. Oh! Mr Beattie, I just... I just popped in to see you. But I know you're very busy so I'm... I'd tread carefully if I were you, Mrs Blake. Bruce Beattie threatened you? Well I did sort of sneak into his office. I'll swap you. It turns out the Mayor approved all Glen's permit applications for the past six months, including Stanton House. So? Without the Committee. What, you think he was on the take? Well it doesn't give him motive to kill Glen Holland. No. But this does. Bribery, Mr Beattie. That's ridiculous. You were personally approving permits and grants to Glen Holland for cash in hand. Which is why you broke into Mrs Blake's house. You were looking for these files. Well you've got no proof for any of this. We have a letter here to you from Glen reneging on your deal for the Stanton House and discussing your private financial agreement. The man was off his rocker. Every application I ever approved was completely above board. Well given that this is a murder investigation, gaining access to your bank accounts will bear that out. Murder? Take him to the cells. We'll hold him 'till we get a search warrant. It won't take long. Wait. Stop. I needed the money. You were on a very good wicket for a long time, Bruce. But my daughter wasn't. Who do you think paid to set up Brenda's stupid bloody nursery? What about Evan Butson? Who? His mother works for Town Hall. Did she overhear something? Find something? She tells her son and he tells the police! Look, I told you. I took the bribes, but I never so much as laid a finger on Glen, or this Evan bloke. What about the night both men died? What do you mean Beattie has an alibi? We have a confession from his mistress. A mistress? And a complete lack of surprise from Mrs Beattie. Oh. Well maybe he didn't murder them. But what about Brenda? Or Don Roper? Maybe her father called in a favour? What about Jack Stanton? You seem to have given him a free pass. Do we have anyone else? We have enough on our plate right now, as I'm sure you do. Maybe I could go and visit Don Roper and... No. Jean, you've been a tremendous help, but I think it's time you left this to us. Constable Crowe, get me the address for Roper's Nursery. Geoffrey. It's the Edgar Allen Poe fan. What's that you're reading? It's about the future. There's a disease and vampires. Ugh! Any good? Ah, alright. I thought I'd loan you this. Ray Bradbury? Oh, you'll like it. Trust me. I expect it back. Nothing worse than someone who borrows a book and doesn't return it. I'll take care of it, I promise. That's a pretty impressive bruise you've got there. Geoffrey! Time to come in! Mr Roper, how about a cup of tea and a chat? Of course, Superintendent. You're serious? I told you, I don't want your help. I know, but maybe you need it. You want me to be your housekeeper? Amy, you're a smart girl. You know things need to change. I don't want to judge you. But you will. Alright, look. Take the job, don't take the job, it's up to you. I smoke. I'm sure we can find an ashtray around here somewhere. Don't mind the odd drink. Nothing I haven't seen before. You're just doing this as a favour for Mum, aren't ya? In part, yes. But also because I remember a time when I felt like I didn't have any options, and someone offered me some work when they didn't have to. I can't do Saturdays. And there's no way on god's green earth I'm washing the Super's smalls. Hey! Private property! Sorry. Go on, bugger off! Jean, what are you doing? Two parents died. Survived by two children. Mrs Blake. Mr Carver. What are you doing here? I'm not sure I should answer that. What are you doing here? I suppose I was curious. About the places in the articles. Worried you'd started something, perhaps? Well it is a lovely day to be out. Two people have died, Mr Carver. But I suppose that sells newspapers, doesn't it? Enjoy your lovely day. Hmm, it's for a good cause. You know the story of a whirlpool at Sommers River, the one they said was responsible for those drownings? Mmm? I don't think it's strong enough to drag down one struggling teenager, let alone two. I don't think it ever was. Oi! Oi! That's the amount of suction you need to drag something under. Are you saying that Steve Whelan did drown those two kids? Perhaps his best friend went in first. Maybe they'd had a fight, about the girlfriend, perhaps. Whatever it was, that poor boy was struck, knocked unconscious, fell in, and after that, Steve panicked. He had to kill the girl, too. No witnesses. Do you think this Steve has it in him to kill someone in cold blood? I think we're all capable of almost anything, given the right circumstances. Including killing Evan Butson? Let me go! You're lucky I didn't shoot you. This is police brutal... Arghh! Listen, that's enough. You're not keeping me in there. Ow! Nice and easy. Just sit down inside, please. Whelan put up a hell of a fight, boss. He kept saying the whole thing was a witch-hunt and that we were lucky he didn't shoot us the moment we set foot on his property. Ah, very smart. Two people have been murdered and he's threatening a police officer. Ah, Super, not two, three. We found another body. And where did you examine the victim, sir? In the bathroom, down the hallway. Her doctor found her. Diana called him. She was jumping at shadows. She thought perhaps she was hearing things. The water was still warm. She'd probably only been dead a few minutes before the doctor arrived. She was undergoing some unorthodox medical therapy? Psychedelics. And marijuana, all in the same week. There's fingertip bruising again. Someone grabbed her by the ankles, lifted her up until she was fully submerged and... Held her there until it was over. I'm guessing the basin was broken in the struggle. Ah, sir? The police found signs of forced entry. She'd obviously run a bath and the killer took advantage. The official cause of death is drowning. There was a significant amount of magnesium sulphate in her lungs and stomach contents. Epsom salts? Yes. There were empty boxes in the rubbish. And, there's something else. Some coarse, fibrous material in the water I haven't been able to identify. Looks a bit like hair. Jean. What are you doing here? - Oh. - I called her. Alice and I were talking with Diana just a few hours ago. Who authorised this? Matthew. You know I'm involved with this case, ever since... Just wait a minute. Ever since you asked for my help with Maggie Butson. I've tried to do this nicely, Jean, but now I'm telling you. I need you to go home. Why? Because I'm a woman? I'm good enough to break bad news to a bereaved mother, or search the Mayor's office for you, but as soon as it comes to something like this... NO! You're not Lucien. Matthew! I'll leave you to it then. Doctor Harvey. We just moved him up here. I don't understand. Where could he have gone? You're not supposed to be here! There he is! Stanton! Get out! Get out of my house! Just calm down! Someone grab him. Come on! Now! Argh! Argh! Get him out of here, Hobart! Argh! Alright, come on! - Arghh! - Why'd you go back to the Stanton House, son? Jack! Really, Doctor? It's gonna be alright. Now what happened? Arghh! No! I'll ask you again. Why did you go back to the Stanton house? Because he thinks it's his house. Except it isn't, is it, Jack? Your fingerprints identified you as John Ellis Mueller, not Stanton. What about Steve Whelan? We got nothing from him. Besides, he was in a cell at the station when Diana Zurvas was murdered. We had to let him go. ARGH! Bloody hell! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Get off me! No no, no no, don't! Don't! Are you alright, Mr... ? Er, Russell. Yeah, I'll live. I'm fine, by the way. Let's get you back to your bed. I was going to hang these up before he got home. I owe you an apology. At least you said his name. Nobody else does anymore, at least not to me. You lose someone and for months, everyone walks on eggshells around you. And then one day, they just expect you to get on with your life. Just like that. But they never say his name, as though that's what'll break you. As if using his name is the one thing that'll remind you that he's gone. Not the empty space in the house, or... this room. Or the waiting. Jean, it's been eight months. The likelihood of him coming back is... I know. But every time the phone rings, or I hear someone at the door... ... I hold my breath. Yeah, me too. May I? I don't talk about him much. Makes me angry. Why? Well, he was the one who decided to take these private cases, decided to travel and decided to go to Sydney, and he was the one who chased that lunatic up to the top of that bridge. Yes, he did. He had everything he ever wanted, but it wasn't enough. He wanted bigger challenges, larger spotlight. We weren't enough for him anymore. That's not who he is. That's not why he did it. He'd have wanted me to look after you. Matthew, I know I'm not a policeman. I know I'm not Lucien. But I can do this. I know this town better than anyone, and if there's some way I can help these people, or the ones left behind... then that's what I have to do. Evan, Glen and Diana, whatever the connection is, I just can't see it. You will. We will. Goodnight, Jean. Have you been up all night? Oh, I got a head of steam going. Right, you'd better walk me through what you've come up with, then? Yes. Diana Zurvas hadn't left her house for over a decade, - making her a sitting... - Chicken. Very funny. It's clearly a duck, amidst unorthodox treatment. Treatment Alice says was working. Mm. Glen Holland, real estate magnate, wanted to buy the Stanton House. Dodgy operator. Several suspects. Including the Mayor of Ballarat. Yes. Don and Brenda Roper. Motives mainly financial. Evan Butson, found with marijuana. Good job, dedicated to his community. Loved his mother. But not connected to any of these stories whatsoever. Well he's the exception. A good place to start. Ah, Amy. Maybe I'll go and put the kettle on. Good idea, Matthew. White with two. If you're offering. You two need to learn to get along. There's a fair bit to do in here. Yes. You'd better get started then. Now adjust the focus here. Oh. This fibre from the jacket looks identical to the fibre in Diana's bathtub, I think. It is, you're right. Matthew. - Oh, I'm sorry... - No, beg your pardon. - So is this the sample you found? - It's coconut fibre. Really? Yes, builders used to use it in mortar and plaster board. So it could be from any old house. We do know for certain it was in the ceiling where Jack was hiding. Matthew, let me speak to him. He'll talk to me. You've got one hour. Jack. Jack? What are you doing here? I wanted to make sure you were alright. Jack, is there anything you wanted to tell me? Yeah, I'd kill for a cup of tea. Russell, do you mind? Oh yeah, help yourself. Would you like another one? No I'm good, thanks. Two sugars. Now if I undo this, you have to promise to behave. Jack, somebody else has been killed. A woman called Diana Zurvas. Do you know who that is? How would I know her? Because she was in the paper a few weeks ago, and so was your... ... your house. Jack, why did you go back there? My Mum took me there once when I was little. She told me we didn't need to be scared, the ghosts were our friends. It was our place. She's dead now. I haven't seen this before, either of them. Are you sure? Even if I had, it wouldn't make a difference. Just because he can't read doesn't take him off the table. The first chance Jack had to escape, he went straight back to the Stanton House. If he did murder Evan, where did he hide the weapon? We beat the bush around that place for a country bloody mile. - The hospital's there. - Yep. Diana's house is there and the Stanton place is there. You sure? That is a pretty big detour for a killer with no motive. No, thanks. Super, that was the War Office. Don Roper wasn't just Infantry in Korea. He was a sniper. We'll pay another visit to Mr Roper. Poor kid. Gets sick, loses his hearing, and it turns turns out his father might be the killer... Matthew. Geoffrey didn't lose his hearing due to illness. Give it! That's enough! He started it! I don't care who started it. You boys had it coming. Two on one, is that fair? Is it? Hey? Here, retard! Take your stupid book! Deaf Geoff! Deaf Geoff! He's got no friends left! Don't you touch me! - Geoffrey! - Geoffrey. Geoffrey! Geoffrey! I... I'm... I... I'm really sorry about your book, sir. I'll replace it. I promise. Not your fault, son. You did nothing to deserve any of this. And I'm gonna make sure it stops. Now hang on a tick. What are you insinuating? I'm not insinuating anything. What I'm saying is that your son is not afraid of policemen or doctors, but you are. If you took Geoffrey to a doctor, someone might see those bruises and ask how he got them. How dare you. That's why he went looking for Evan, after he found the body in the Stanton House, and not his Dad, right? I do not beat my son. No. You don't. But your wife does. It wasn't measles that cost your son his hearing, was it Brenda? Hmm? His medical records suggest that he'd been struck! That woman out there had no right to tell you that. Is that for me? - Yes. - Thank you. Why would I beat my son? Because you're just like your father. Happiest when punching down. And you, you turned a blind eye because it's her father's money that's keeping your business afloat! No. No, the Scoutmaster, Evan, I, I thought it was him. That's why I went on the camp. Is that why you killed him? I wouldn't have used a bow and arrow in the dark. I'd have taken my rifle and shot him point blank. Come on, son. Geoffrey. I'll be visiting in the next few days to discuss that book that I lent you, if it's alright with Mr and Mrs Roper. Alright. I'd have taken my rifle and shot him. Big man. You were lucky he didn't shoot us the moment we set foot on his property. I think you might have been right about something all along. Ohh! Oh! Argh! Argh! Ow! Ow! Arghh! What happened? - I've been shot. - Up you go, gently. Oh, you'll be alright, Mr Whelan. Did you see where the shot came from? From over there. See, I told you someone was watching me. He's extremely lucky. The arrow missed his femoral artery. We've extracted it. He's resting now. I thought we had him. I think we still might have. Isn't that a trefoil head? The same kind that killed Evan? Yes. And there's something else. It's a simple question, Steven. Do you own a gun? As a matter of fact I don't. I've got very sensitive hearing. That's funny, because I heard that you threatened to shoot my officers if they so much as set one foot on your property. The wound on your leg, Mr Whelan, is actually two wounds. The first, where the arrow didn't go in far enough and the second on almost exactly the same spot. Everyone underestimates the force needed to penetrate skin and tissue. Do you think I stabbed myself in the leg with an arrow? It's not an arrow, it's a crossbow bolt. If you were shot by a crossbow in the fleshy part of the thigh, even from a hundred feet, the bolt'd go clean through your leg. I've been reading up on toxophily. Someone shot me! It must have been the same guy that shot Evan. It's the same kind of arrow. Yes, it was. But that is a detail that was never released, was it, Superintendent? Now, I'm guessing if I did authorise a search that we wouldn't be able to find that crossbow in your house. But the bolt in your leg? Its fletching has very faint traces of a second blood type. And we're betting that it's Evan Butson's blood. You told him too much that night you went drinking, down at the pub about what really happened at the river. He was gonna tell the police. He would have told everyone. All those years trying to hide what I did, trying to forget it. And now it's ruined my life anyway. And what about Glen and Diana? What about them? Oh, I had nothing to do with their deaths. Why would I lie to you now? Another one? Oh, thank you, Cec. Have there been any more complaints? Ma'am, I will resign before I ever ask you to leave. Is everything alright? We found the man who killed Evan Butson. Oh, that's wonderful news. Yes it is. But it means whoever killed Diana Zurvas and Glen Holland is still out there somewhere. I don't know what to do, Cec. Jean. Jean. You learnt from the very best. I've spoken to all the suspects. I've look at all the evidence. I've even searched all the sites. Oh, I'm sure you were very thorough. Maybe not thorough enough. Fancy seeing you here. Mr Carver. Look at that view. You can see almost all the way out to the Jimmenholly Farm. You been to Lovers Lane before? Yes, I was here yesterday. I thought the killer might have been here. It's just you and me for the moment. Oh. What have you found? Someone's got a sweet tooth. What is it you're looking for, Jean? I need to go. I don't care where it's gone! That uniform is your responsibility! Where's Russell? Jean. Call the police! Tell them Jean Blake asked them to come. Are you sure about this? The coat that he left behind with the stains. They're Epsom salts. And what do you propose to do if we find him? What do you mean? I mean, even with one arm, how are we supposed to stop him? Argh! Argh! - Jean! Oh! - Alice! Ow! - Are you alright? - Yes! Chief Superintendent! Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. Ah, security guard. He was wearing odd clothing. Jack was right. Well, read him his rights, Constable. He's out cold, boss. Well you could use the practise, son. Russell Payton-Smith, I'm arresting you for the murders of Diana Zurvas and Glen Holland. Er, Jean, we can do this later, if you'd like. No, I'm fine. So what do you need? Well why don't you take us through it. Russell. Russell murdered Diana's boyfriend back in 1951 in Lovers Lane. He left town. But because she could only remember a man with a hook, Russell escaped without detection. Until the stories from The Courier were reprinted all over the country, saying that she was beginning to remember what happened. Russell arrived back in town to get rid of the one witness that was left. But he needed to find the right time to kill Diana, and until then, he didn't want anyone to see him. So he hides out in the one place he thinks no one will look. The Stanton House. And Glen Holland was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Once he killed Glen Holland, he needed a new place to lay low, so he camps out by Lovers Lane. Which is where I first ran into him. Hey! This is private property. Then later that night, he drowns poor Diana in her own bath. But he slips on the water on the floor. He shatters the basin and his own arm. Probably sat there for a while wondering what to do next. And then he saw the bowl of mints and his sweet tooth got the better of him. The bowl of mints, the string of lollies, the empty sugar bowl on the tray. He can't help himself. Russell came back to Ballarat for one reason only: to kill Diana, to hide what happened all those years ago. But every time he tries to conceal what happened, something goes wrong, just like Steve Whelan. Will that be enough? The coat with the Epsom salt stains belonged to Glen Holland. Russell took it after he killed him. And if Alice runs tests on Russell's clothing, she'll find coconut fibres, I'm sure of it. Ah, this was in Glen Holland's coat. It's addressed to you. This is why he wanted to meet you at the Stanton House. Well well well, look who we have here. Gentlemen. As I'm sure you're aware, Mrs Blake, club rules clearly state that when a... The Council knows about your bribes, Bruce. And about your plans to acquire the Stanton House for yourself. Glen wanted me to have this. It's your letters to him. Bit of a waste of time, really. Jack Mueller actually is related to the Stanton family on his mother's side, so he will be inheriting the house. Mrs Blake, you're hysterical. No, far from it, actually. And by the way, I'll be petitioning the club board to make some changes around here. They will never allow female members. I wouldn't worry, Bruce. You won't be part of the vote. One LAST drink, sir? Television. Makes it more real, doesn't it, seeing it all? It's the way of the future. I'm told congratulations are in order. Two murderers caught, three cases closed, all in one day. Well, at least the families have some answers now. That's what all of this was about the whole time, wasn't it? You're one of the orphaned Finchley children. What gave me away? The maths. And Jimmenholly Farm. No one's called it that for 30 years. You were right. I used the other articles to hide the one story that I wanted answers to. I'd take it all back if I could. It can't be undone now. I know I've no right to ask this, but for now, if you could keep this between us, then... I won't tell a soul. I've spent my whole life wondering what happened that night. I suppose that's something you and I have in common. Unexplained loss. Martin, a little advice if I may. You can spend your whole life focussing on the past. Or you can look forward. Be grateful for the people you have and the time you have with them. Goodnight. ... to be said for the repose of the soul of the first Roman Catholic President, a devout man from a devout family. Amy. Decent first day? Not bad, I guess. You'd better hurry. Dinner's ready. That's way too much food for three people, if you ask me. Mrs Blake, the fence is done. She's not pretty, but she'll hold. Thank you, Peter. You'd better go and wash up. Dinner's on the table. I've asked Peter to join us for dinner. You can, um, stay if you like. Thanks. I've got plans. There. This looks amazing, Mrs Blake. Yes, I think Amy might be trying to show me up. Ahh! Plans change. Yes, I thought they might, so I set you a place. Pull up a chair. Ah, a toast, to Jean and Alice, for making Constable Crowe and I look only reasonably ridiculous today. To good food. And good friends. Stop smiling. Leave him be, Matthew. Come on, dig in. Matthew? Thank you. Get our beets first. Drumstick for you, Alice? Thank you.
