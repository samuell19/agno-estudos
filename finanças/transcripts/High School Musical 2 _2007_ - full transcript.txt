I understand you have moved every summer for the past five years and I'd hate to think today is goodbye No worries, my mom promised I'm here till graduation next year Bless mom's little heart! Sharpay, we got off to a rough start but you really came through - I mean, you helped me with the winter musical. - I did? With those vocal exercises. Cyaa! Gabriella and I have had like five job interviews but we keep getting beat up by college kids. Yeah, same here. I guess I'm back in the babysitting business! - Hi Martha, Hi Taylor. - Hi Kelsi, what're you planning to do this summer? Grow. Write music. Grow! Your summer activities consultant has arrived.

I just can't... - T as in Troy - Well... Yes Hey man? How's it going? There you go, boss. - Let's go! - Yeah sure! Sure, cause we're not so busy or anything. We could go to the movies, download music... oh, and I'm definitely teaching you a twisted flip on a skateboard. Oh, and I've first aid training so I can patch myself up afterwards. Alright! Going to movies, listening to music. I'm Golly Troy! I have first aid training! Ah, ah, ah! Oh, please! Oh, come here, Kelsi. I have a summer job for you. At our country club, our rehearsal pianist is evidentally moving. - Or hiding. - Pardon? Sounds great! Cheer up Shar, its summer. We can do whatever we want too! - Everything changes - Ryan. - Who is the absolute premo boy these times? - I would say Troy Bolton... has that category pretty much locked up, don't you think? And East Highs premo girl? Just answer the question! Gosh, uhh... You? Troy and Sharpay. - Sharpay and Troy. Sharpay... - Shar! - It just makes sense. - Evidentally not to Troy. But, its summer, Ry.

Wow! Tell you what, seeing moves that I didn't see last season, keep it coming, guys! - What team? - Wildcats! So guys, how is the job hunt coming? The big 'zero'. Uh-oh! Girlfriend alert! Talk to me! This is Thomas Fulton, general manager at Lava Springs Country Club ...here in Albuquerque. I understand you have been looking for summer work Hey, Troy? Does Gabriella still remember your name, or did she find somebody new to Karaoke with this summer? It sounds fantastic, Mr. Fulton, but how did you get my name? We've always had a student summer work program here at Lava Springs. - So are you ready? - Here is the thing... I know the most amazing girl. Uh, I mean student... straight As, clean couple straight A and it would be so amazingly perfect if... Well, we can certainly speak with her! - He is really working someone? - It could be Gabriella. You know, whenever she calls, he just blushes. - I never said that! - Yes! - What's up, dog? - Nothing, nothing. Nothing! Ok, I tell you what. You guys stick together this summer. You work on the game... ...and we are talking champions! Can we all redirect this energy by carrying in the groceries? Yes, Mrs. Bolton. Hey, we are kicking out for another hot summer here in Albuquerque. So, for those cool enough to have a convertible. Crank up the sound, breath that fresh air and say 'Hello!' to summer! Ms. Evans, Mr. Evans Looking very sharp this summer. - Welcome back to Lava Springs. - Thank you, Charles. Hi boy! Oh, can you find some shade for my car? Even if we have to plant a tree! - Fulton. - And may I have to say... Welcome back. It's good to be home. - Are the flyers ready? - This year we embossed... - the flyers for the show. - Inspired. Oh, I plan to limit... member-town auditions to 30 seconds each. Amateur performers are very-- - Draining? - Yes! - Understood. - And should I... we be so fortunate as to win the Star Dazzle award. Again! - but where we put it? - You were planning on expanding... ...the trophey case. The designs are in my office. Fulton, you are so efficient. The staffing matter we discussed? Done! With discretion. Fabulous! - What staffing? Yes! - Ryan! - Sharpay - Girls! Your shade in its usual spot, sir? Thank you, Javier. Emma, Jackie and Lea are east of me. Oh, and you will be a prince and guard our shade on the hour... - as the sun moves. - Well, thanks to the... ...kind words from your mother last season, I have been promoted. But, no worries. I will make sure that the new lifeguard is fully briefed on... just how you like things. So, what's the theme for this summer talent show,Sharpay? - Redemption. - Love it. It's a very trying year, ladies. My drama department was invaded by outsiders. Singers came from the Chemistry lab and the locker room. - Shockingly. - Sis. We have got the pool, the entire club and the whole summer to enjoy it. - And the Spa has been redone. - There is a guacamole facial... - and a seaweed body scrub on the menu - What could be more fabulous? - More ice! - Right away, sir. # It's out with the old, And in with the new, # # Goodbye clouds of gray, Hello skies of blue, # # A dip in the pool, A trip to the spa, # # Endless days in my chaise, The whole world according to moi, # Excuse me! Thank you! # Iced tea imported from England, Lifeguards imported from Spain # # Towels imported from Turkey, Turkey imported from Maine, # # We're gonna relax and renew, You, go, do! # # I want fabulous, That is my simple request, # # All things fabulous, Bigger and better and best, # # I need something inspiring to help me get along, # # I need a little fabulous, Is that so wrong? # # Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip flops, # # Where is my pink Prada tote? # # I need my Tifany hair band, And then I can go for a float. # # A summer like never before # # I want more! # # She wants fabulous, That is her simple request, # # All things fabulous, Bigger and better and best, # # She needs something inspiring to help her get along, # # She needs a little fabulous, Is that so wrong? # # Fabulous pool, fabulous splash, Fabulous parties, even fabulous trash, # # Fabulous fashion, Fabulous bling, # # She's got to have fabulous everything, # # Nothing to discuss, Everything's got to be perfect, for me! # # She wants fabulous, That is her simple request, # # All things fabulous, Bigger and better and best, # # She's fabulously inspiring to help her get along, # # She's gotta need a little fabulous, Is that so wrong? # # This won't do, that's a bore, That's insulting, I need more! # # I need, I need, I need, I need, I need, # I need fabulous!

Not! I got you, I got you. It's okay! - What are you doing here? - I am the new lifeguard. Wait! Are you a member here? I told you to hire Troy Boltan, not the entire East High student body. You told me to hire Troy Bolton, umm, whatever it takes! Well, why didn't you warn me about the rest of them? I did discuss the matter with the Lava Springs board, of course. The board? You mean, our... Mother! Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats! Mother, how could you? Think of your future kid, these are your school chums, not the fuddy duddy Lava Springs staff. These are not my chums. They'll steal my talent show. And what fresh talent will you have for your summer show? Mother! Did you hear what I just said? - Ryan, talk to Mother! - Hi, Mom. Ducky, how is my dashing boy? Tell Pumpkin if she worries to much, she will get frown lines! Doh! Namaste! - I want them out! - But your mother specifically said... Oh, don't mention that backstabbing yokley to me! If you can fire them, make them want to quit. I am hoping, Chef Michael is going to teach me... the art of Austrian flake pastry. And Sharpay is going to be where I work everyday! How much better can summer get right? Right, right? - Well, a dream come true! - If you actually get to know her... - I mean-- - Dude, I didn't even know Sharpay's parents... owns this place. Mr. Fulton just said you know... there are Wild Cat fans at Lava Springs and jobs are available. - So I said lets go for it! - Inspiring, Mr. Bolton. Truly inspiring, however what we are looking for, from all of you, is not inspiration but perspiration. Confirming assignments. Bolton, Danforth. Waiters. - And when needed, Caddies. - What? Miss McKessie, I am told that you are efficient Prove it. You'll handle member activities. Keep me insight at all times! Kelsi, ha-ha! Piano. Lunch time and cocktail hour. That means mood music, not new music, kapeesh? Martha. Chopping, cutting, preparing plates. Do complete the summer with the equal amount of digits... ...I assume that you currently possess. Oh, Zeke! - You will assist Chef Michael in the-- - The promised land! You hold on to that! Mr. Fulton, your Excellency Sir. Would it be okay if we draw straws to see who has to wait on Sharpay? Please, none of you will be waiting on Sharpay! - You will be serving Miss Evans. - Who is that? Always address our members as Mr, Mrs or Miss! - Right shall we? - Do we have to? I don't know. Miss Evans, would you care for a lemonade? Actually, I am not Miss Evans. I am Jason. Oh, it smells so good and I am so hungry. What's for lunch? Miss Montez, it would seem your lunch break does not start for 3.5 minutes. I do hope no members would drown in your absence? Henceforth, do clock in and out on time. Three infractions of any kind, and your employment is terminated. Kapeesh? Okay, that man officially scares me. Suddenly, I am beginning to miss detention with Miss Darbus. - How sick is that? - Come on, we got a hoop out back, two to three meals a day and we only have to wear these stupid outfits on duty. All for one and one for all? Alright, this is our summer. - What team? What team? - Wildcats! Wildcats! Now come on. # How did we get from the top of the World to the bottom of the heap? # # I don't recall you mentioning the boss is such a creep, # # We still have the ingredients to make this summer sweet, # # - Well, I got rags instead of riches, - And all these dirty dishes, # # - Just wish I had three wishes. # - Okay guys, break it up. # We've got to work, work, to work this out, # # We'll make things right, the sun will shine # # If we work, work, there'll be no doubt, We can still save the summer, # # If we work this out! # Dude, what have you got us into? Come on, we can totally turn this thing around. # I'd rather face a seven footer straight up in the post, # # That sure beats hangin' here, And burning someone's toast, # # I needed Benjamins, But this ain't worth the stress, # # Maybe there's a better way to fix this greasy mess, # # We're a champion team, a well-oiled machine, # # and we've faced tougher problems than this, # # I know it's a grind, But I'm sure we can find, # # a way to have fun while we get this job done. # # We've got to work, work to work this out # # We'll make things right the sun will shine # # We got to work, work, there'll be no doubt # # If we all come together, We can work this out! # Let's work it! # - Tell me what you want, - Tell me what you need, # # - A little bit of sugar, - A little bit of butter, # # - It's the perfect recipe! - Pay day! # # - It'll taste so sweet - Pay Day! # # - Good enough to eat, - Gonna make some motion pictures, # # Hit the mall with all my sisters # # Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers # # Kick it with the music mixers # # Buy a ride that suits my style # # - Lounge around the pool and while... - Make a date with my favorite girl # # We've got it made! # # We've got to work, work to work this out # # We'll make things right, the sun will shine # # If we work, work, there'll be no doubt, We can still save the summer, # # If we work this out! # Work this! Gotta work this! We can work this out! So can we work this out? Yeah, we can work it out! Send the waiters right in! Miss me? Of course, she did. - Hey, have you ever been on the golf course? - We are employees, Troy... not members. and I don't play golf. Who said anything about golf? Are you sure it's okay for us to be out here? Yeah, unless the Jack Rabbits turn us in. So, how is kitchen duty? Well, you know the team that washes dishes together, wins together. My mom says summer jobs are good on college applications. All part of the frightening concept called our future. Are you worried? Hey. College costs a fortune. My parents are saving pennies unlike the people at this place. Your certain for a scholarship I'm only as good as what happens next season. I always liked the idea of being in charge of my future. - Until it actually started happening. - So just think about right now. Cause I have never been in one place for an entire summer. It means a lot to me. Especially being here with... an outstanding peanut butter and jeally sandwich maker like me? I want to remember this summer, Troy. Here, catch! Aww, I love this game. - Ready? - Go! - Beautiful! - Oh, yes! Your turn. - You didn't get a single one. - You... That was so bad. Ohh! Fulton, when I was in the fourth fairway today, it seemed, bone dry. Oh, no way! Could you tell maintenance to give it another life shaft? Splash? No way! - May I have this dance? - Why, of course you may! Let's go then. It's so wet! Keep an eye on them tomorrow and keep me posted. - Why are you smiling? - No worries, Ryan. This is our turf. Remember? First, a break time infraction. And now frolicking on the golf course. We are not off to an auspicious start, are we Miss Montez? Actually, Mr Fulton, this was my idea. How gallant! But irrelevant. We won't allow this to happen again, will we? - Morning, everybody! That smells good! That smells good! Hey! - Hey, good morning! - Same! # You are the music in me. # Sounding good, Kels. # Thanks. Actually I gotta get ready for the ladies luncheon. # Won't exactly be rocking out but... You know I am so excited about the club's talent show. I mean, employees get to do a number, and I have ideas for everyone. You guys can sing the lead, Maybe Zeke and Chad could do backup. And everyone could dance! Big time out on that one. Uh, my singing career began... ...and ended with the East High Winter Musical. I'm just here to make a cheque and sneek into the pool after work. That's really it. - What was that you were playing a minute ago? - Oh it's nothing, it's just nothing. - What's this? - Well, I was thinking if you do the show. That I wanted to be ready. I wrote this for you guys. Come on. Go! # You are the music in me # # You know the words, Once upon a time, # # Make you listen, There's a reason, # # When you dream, There's a chance you'll find, # # A little laughter, Or a happy ever after, # # Your harmony to the melody # # It's echoing inside my head # # A single voice, single voice! Above the noise and like a common thread # Hmm, you're pulling me. # When I hear my favorite song, I know that we belong, # # Oh, you are the music in me, Yeah it's living in all of us # # And it's brought us here because, you are the music in me # # You are the music in me # # - It's like I knew you before we met, - Before we met. # # - Can't explain it. There's no name - Oh, oh! # # For it, no name for it! I'm saying words I never said # # - And it was easy, - So easy! # # - Because you see the real me, - I see. # # As I am, you understand, And that's more than I've ever known # # - To hear your voice. Above the noise. - Hear your voice. Ohh! # # And no, I'm not alone # Oh, you sing it to me! # When I hear my favorite song, I know that we belong, # # You are the music in me, It's living in all of us, # # And it's brought us here because, You are the music in me! # # - Together we're gonna sing - Yeah! # # - We got the power to sing what we feel - What we feel. # # - Connected and real - Can't keep it all inside # # You are the music in me # # You are the music in me # # When I hear my favorite song, I know that we belong # # You are the music in me Yeah it's living in all of us # # It's brought us here because, You are the music in me! # # You are the music in me # - I love that song. - Great job Kels. I have got the talent show sign up sheet right here. Are you in? Maybe we can work this out, but only... if we are all in this together. This is going to be fantastic. I am going to co-ordinate the rehearsals that coincide with all our schedules, Golden Throat, this is Jazz Square. We may have trouble. You know, it's an amazing song but Kelsi didn't write it for us. - Hi, Mom! - Seaweed scrub, darling? - May be later. - Ryan, it might be wonderful... - if Troy participates in our talent show. - What? If he sings with Gabriella then our whole show is going to be the Troy and Gabriella show. I'm not certain Gabriella is ideally suited to help... ...Troy realize his full potential here at Lava Springs. - Mommy, what time is Daddy going to be here? -We tee off at noon. - Join us? - Love too! - How are we getting to the food today, Chad? - I don't know, perhaps skipping. Very well then. Shall we? Danforth. Bolton. Your caddying today. Forty dollars a bag. You have been requested. What? - By who? - Dude! Who cares for 40 bucks? - I would caddy for Godzilla. - Close, very close. - Thank you! - Thanks. Thank you, sir. - Hey boys. - Hey. So Troy, I thought it was time for you to meet my parents. - Ashanti. - Awesome! - Hi. - Hello. So where is your dad? Hi, Daddy! Where is the first tee and what is the course record? I'm just kidding, I built the course myself and hold the record, but who is counting? Princess. Mwah! - Son, you have been working out. - Yoga. Bring that around. There you go. Quite a season you boys had? - Oh, Troy played for the golf team too, Daddy. - Versatile. - How about you son? - Baseball, track or field. - Outstanding. - Might come in handy the way I play golf. Fair warning. Brilliant darling, brilliant. Chad, you will be caddying for mother. Troy... For Daddy. Daddy. - Bravo. - Brilliant. Let's take a walk. - Is that a new outfit? - Yes I got it just this morning. And yours? Come on, Chad. What you think? Well it's 190 to the pin, down-hill, lie with elevated green. I would go with the full 5, sir. Nice call. Princess. Grab your pitching wedge, this one's yours. Thanks, Daddy. Line it up. - That's my girl. - That girl needs to take up knitting. Or some sport where she can only injure herself. - I'm in the sand. - Me, too. Knees, hips, shoulders, hat. Good, fill in. Backboard. That's my boy. - Where? - I have no idea. Gabriella, dinner tonight? Sneek a swim? - Lovely darling, nice. - Daddy? - Why not let Troy try a shot? - Of course, of course! - No, I shouldn't. - Come on. - Are you sure? - Yes! Yes! - Are you sure it's okay, Mr Evans? - It sure is. - A little to the right. - Well, thank you. - That's a beautiful swing. - Really is. Oh, that is a beautiful swing! - That was awesome. - Thanks, man. - What? - I don't know. Off we go. I'm saving up for a car. I'm saving up for a car. Tiger Woods would have been proud to make that putt. What a shame that Troy is only brushing dishes all summer. Given that he is a potential star from outer, Daddy. I've seen Troy play basketball. The Red Hawks would be very interested in him. That's inspired, daddy. Troy is very concerned about college. Really? How is Coach Bolton these days? - Fantastic. - Outstanding. What? Next time I see country club princess and her... ...I am going to launch her and her pink cart tread into the lake. - I will build the ramp, buddy. - Dan, this is a kitchen, not a day spa. You and Jason, suit up for dinner duty in the dinning room. Bolton, you have 5 minutes to change and come with me. In case you're not familiar with this particular item, it goes around your neck. Like a uhh, dog collar. - She stepped on a... - I did not! Yes, you did. I can believe that. Hey, here is our superstar. Troy Bolton, this is Peter. Peter. Good to meet you. - This is Claire. And you know the family. - Hello. This kid is pretty handy on the fairways as well as the hard court. I bet you worked yourself up an appetite, lugging those bags all over the place, huh? - Err, yeah just a little bit. - How about we get some food? - Then we can talk about your future. - My future? Yes, sit down. Daddy is on the board of directors at the university of Albuquerque. So, Troy. I saw your championship game and I mean, wow! That last second shot at the buzzer. Outstanding! Actually, my team mates here, Stole the ball, otherwise I wouldn't have had a chance. Oh, you're much to modest, Troy. You were voted MVP for the entire season. This year positively screams for a win tonight. - Thank you. - Let me get that for you. You know, we have got a heck of a basketball program over at the U.A. It's got an excellent scholarship program as well. Scholarship? Yeah, you know between the two of us here we, uhh, pull a little of weight over at the school. Well umm, time flies when your are having fun. But, Mr. Fulton will probably want me clocking out at the minute. Oh, come on, don't be silly, you haven't had any dessert. - We haven't talked about golf yet? - Basketball and golf are just... the beginning of Troy, Daddy. Have you heard him sing? Oh, a triple threat. Oh, how wonderful Troy can participate in the talent show. Come on, Troy, give them a sample. Kelsi! No, actually my voice is feeling a little bit hoarse tonight. With all the talking... but, thank you very much for the food, and the golf and everything. It was amazing. But, you will sing some other time though, with me? Promise? - Promise. - Perfect. Dessert? Sorry, I am late. Give me two more minutes. Nice tie. Your shoes don't match, though. Kidding. Honey, two minutes is being late. But an hour, is approaching a felony. Just because Troy is a nice guy doesn't mean he is immune.... - to Boy Disease. - Boy Disease? Yeah, forgetting things he shouldnt forget. - Oh so now, you're a boy expert? - My older sister, has ten rules about boy behavior. and nine of them involve boys forgetting things they should never forget. - Like dinner dates. - Well it wasn't an official date type of thing. Rule number three: All dates are official! Whether the boy knows it or not. Hey... Lifeguard! Your crazy, Wildcat. I'm so late. But I bought food, a few candles... I'm going to throw a pool side picnic. What do you say? Zeke even made desserts. But first, I dare you to jump in. You know I'm not supposed to be in the pool. Club rules! Cramp! I need a lifeguard. Help! Rescue me! Rescue me! Here I come! So if your coming in, follow me! Oh shit, listen? You know... right now with you... ...it's finally starting to feel like summer. Yeah, it is. The water bugs are back! Look, Mr. Fulton, this was my idea... - she had nothing to do with it. - I generously over looked your... previous break violation, but then, came the golf course jolt. And now, this, two strikes. Don't get a third! Out of the pool. Sharpay's dad let me play a few holes, and then invited me to dinner with some of the U.A board. Really? I'm talking about scholarships, while Jason and Chad were like serving me. You're getting paid for it. It's called a job. You were invited, nothing wrong with that. I don't know, it felt weird. I love that you have got the team working together. But you're not going to be a Wildcat forever. The team is now, and that's... that's good but everybody has got their own future. I'm not sure I know what you mean. Well, when you graduate, lots of people are going to be chasing... ...the same opportunities. There is nothing wrong with keeping your eye on the prize. - In fact, if you don't, you are left behind. - Yeah I know, I'm just saying... I didn't get my friends jobs at the clubs so they could, sit and watch me eat in the dining room. I'm just saying never be ashamed of attention as long as you have earned it. A scholarship is special. That's why there's only few of them around. I get it, Dad. - Okay, so how was the food at Lava Springs? - Insanely good. - Take it out for a spin. - No way? Well you didn't think I was going to drive this heap, did you? Yes, yes! Okay, bring those knees up as high as you can and circle those arms, Hey, water bug. Last night was so fun, - I really didn't mean to get you in trouble. - Same here. - So maybe later we can have our... - Troy! Uh, what time is your lunch break? Troy! - 1:30. - 1:30, great! Cheeseburgers are on me. Everyone, it looks great Awesome job. Okay, now some Jumping Jacks! Hey, what's she up too? - Who knows? - Believe me, she does. I am sorry I am late, Mr. Fulton. But about the pool thing last night... - ...you can't blame Gabriella. - I'm promoting you. - Your what? - There is an opening as an assistant... to the golf pros. Salary job, no clocking in, at 500 dollars a week, plus tips. What? Per week? Oh my, that's off the hook! I ca-- I think it sounds very natural. Shall we? - Wait, so you want me to teach golf? - To kids. Oh, the joy. Sir, I don't think I am qualified. Worry not, simply show the little angels which end of the club to hold, Tee the ball up, then duck! In addition, the board is extending membership privileges to you. You have complete use of club facilities. But do so prudently! Meaning 'Hello Wildcats!', not! Congratulations! You will find an appropriate choice of clothing here. Do not mix checks with plaids, blue with browns... ...and avoid wearing white socks, at all costs. Leave your shoes outside the locker. They will be ducted and polished each evening. Oh, man! Save it for the first tee. And to get there. This might come in handy. That's the key to your golf cart. Number 14. The same number that is on your basketball uniform. So I am told. Questions? How did this happen? It would seem that the Evans' family thinks you have, untapped potential. Young man, the future is full of uncharted waters. And this family has real cloud. So I suggest, you take the ride. Yeah! Italian. Awesome junior golfers, you guys look amazing! Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, slow down champ, slow down! Save some for the other kids. There you go. Cool shorts, buddy. Alright. Hey, cutie. Try holding the club that way, you are going to hit it way farther. Nice back swing man, nice back swing. Good job, killer, make the ball fear you. You look good, great job everybody. Good job guys! Bolton, Bolton. - Your 11:30 is here - Thanks. Good luck, buddy. Troy! Oh, man! Cool balls! - Thanks. - You're welcome. By the end of the summer, you will have me playing like a pro. Yeah, whoa, if I live that long. I am so excited about the show, Dont worry, we will find something great to do. Look, Sharpay, I already told you. Singing really isn't my thing. And here is the best news, all the Red Hawks losers will be there. - Really? - Of course. We will lock up your scholarship with a high C... right from centre stage. - We are all in this together, right? - Your parents have been really really nice, Sharpay. But singing with you isn't a part of my job. I know, just something you promised to do. Remember? You look fabulous in your new clothes by the way. Do you like the shoes? They're Italian. Nice. Let me show you how this is done. It's really easy. Just line up your target. Nice easy back swing. - Hey Gab! - Hey! That girl has got more moves than an octopus in a wrestling match. - Nah, he knows how to swim. - Yeah, Troy can handle himself. I did overhear him asking for her opinion, on his new... - Italian golf shoes. - He didn't ask me. So, wake up sister. She is basically offering him a college education, just to sing with her in the talent show. - Troy would never do that. - You got eyes, use them. - Let's go eat! - Yeah, I gotta go. - See you later? - Okay. - You're gonna take it back, then through. - Troy, Fulton wants you in the lobby. Fantastic. Thank you. See you! And she steps on the ball... - Troy Bolton this is... - I've seen them all play for the U.A, Alright, well come scrimmage at our gym. It will be good for your game. - Play with you guys? - Yeah, let's get down, bro. - Awesome - Alright. Let's all get some awesome lunch. I knew it, coral blue! It's perfect for your skin tone. And mine too. - We are made this skin tone compatible, Troy. - I have no idea what that means. You don't need too. I'm here for you. Who's hungry? Let's eat! I mean, how can you hit the ball straight if your clubs don't trust you? That's the key. So its all in the grip, you gotta hold it just right. Ooh, that looks great! Hey, I almost forget. I order Swiss on my burger. - So go ahead and check it out man. Try it! - Alright. Table three needs more ice tea. No, rotate your hands over the top. Put your thumb on that side. There you go, man! - You good, I'll see you on the course. - Yeah let's do it, man. - Zeke, yo Troy! One swiss. - Coming right up. I think you're right. There is a guy out there that looks just like Troy Bolton, but I have no idea who he really is. Hey, Kelsi has got some great new ideas to spice up the talent show-- Eye on the results. Uh, that new duet that Troy and Gabriella sing. I need it. Actually, it's not available. Repeat! It's something I wrote for Troy and Gabriella, just in case they decided-- You're an employee Not a fairy god mother! Let's have it. Transpose it into my key. Troy and I will be doing it in the talent show. Oh and run up the tempo. We will need to keep people awake. - What about our song, what about Hum-uh-um-uh? - Change of plans. What am I supposed to do with my Tikki warrior outfit? Save it for Halloween, Go to a Lua or sell it online. I don't know. But in the meantime, keep an eye on those Wildcats. If they're planning on being in the show, which I doubt, once they hear about Troy and me. I don't want any surprises. Oh and don't worry. I'll find a song for you somewhere in the show. Or the next show. Really? Dont strain yourself, Slick. Entertainers are so temperamental. Transpose! Look at you! Go, Team! It's a gift from the guys. The guys? Oh, you know those tall people. Yeah look, I got to go in a minute. But I will be back in about an hour. I'll pick you up in my new truck. We will go to a movie. I promise. A promise is a really big word, Troy. - Yeah, I know. - And we have got to stop baseball game... after work. Remember you promised that you'd play? Right, right baseball. I will absolutely meet you there. You forgot, didn't you? No, I just got the days mixed up. And I'm sorry I couldn't make lunch today. It's been wild! You know? I can't believe how things are working out here. So I see. Italian golf shoes, new clothes, golf carts. It's crazy stuff; hard to keep track of it, all I bet. - So what's your point? - It just doesn't seem like new stuff. It seems like a new Troy. Alright. Let's see if Tiger Woods still has a jump shot? - Hey Bolton, come on. - Hey. Tell them to come over here and mix it up? We will show them some game. You know, I don't think that's how they roll. - So how they roll? - No, no, that is not what I meant. I just think it's a, uhh, closed practice. Sorry. - Maybe you can get us a video. - Bolton, come on. You said we were going to play two on two after work before the baseball game. I know, I know man. I am sorry. Come on, Zeke, that was from yesterday. You know, when we were all a team! - Hey man! - Hey, how is it going? Hey Bolton! It's my ball. Let's go, guys. Would you guys be mad at me if I asked him to get me one of those cool, red, hot jackets? Hey, come on. - I'm so excited about the game. - Hey, Ryan! No rehearsals? Nope, my sister is working up something new. So, are you coming to the baseball game? I'm not staff. - I wasn't invited. - Hey, everyone's invited. Come on, hop in. Alright. Hold on! Hi Martha, hi Kelsi. What Fulton sent you out here to spy on us? Nah, my sister did. She thinks you guys are going to upstage her talent show. No worries. We were going to do the show but Troy bailed on us. - Whatever. - What do you mean whatever? It's our summer, remember? I thought we decided doing the show would be fun. - Well, I think so. - Me too. Who are we kidding? I dont think so. - We don't know how to put others a show. - No, but he does. If we have a real director putting it together, it could be great. Have the employees ever won the Star Dazzle award? - Okay no. - I know what you can do for us, Ryan. - So why not do it for us? - Look, do you want to play ball? Then grab a mitt. But I don't dance. You don't think dancing takes some game. You got game? A little. Hey, pitcher. All right, let's hustle! Come on, Wildcats, get your head in the game.

Hey, Evans! I'm not saying that I am going to dance in the show. But if I did. What would you have me do? - Respect! - Go! Go, defense! Hold it tight, man! - Come on, come on, come on! - He's free. Play it, play it. This kid's good. I like what I am seeing. Troy gives a 110, 24 hours a day. That you can count on. - Go, go, go! - It's there. - Good game! - Good game! Well, was I right? Alright. So you call that a little game? Little, meek. World series. Newport, Road Island. Champions. Hey, guys. That's so awesome. Troy, are you ready to run it back? - Alright! - Right, lets go! - Yo! - Let's go yo, let's go, let's run it back! It's looking good. Wild, Wildcats. Too much? Only in daylight. East side colours. Very impressive. - Hey! Be true to your school right? - Absolutely. Everyone is excited about doing the show. Hey, I know everyone thinks that I am Sharpay's poodle but I really think that... Hey, if they were thinking that, they are not thinking that today. How do you do that swing step that you did last night? That's easy. So, I called last night. I got a--hung up at the gym. Hey, my dad says your doing great with those college guys. Oh yeah, they're awesome, playing with them is like being in another world. Well, you missed out on a fun night. It was a great game. But the dessert afterwards, had to be the best part. - Her mom makes the best brownies in the entire world-- - Yeah, I know, I have had them. I'll see you guys later. - Hey labron, how did it go with the Red Hawks? - You know, they're very tall. We got Vince from maintenance to play, so it all worked out incase you're wondering. - Well maybe we can play later today? - I don't know. Check with Vince. - Mr. Evans set up the workout, not me. - Did you even ask to include us? - Captain? - I didn't go looking for the Red Hawks. The Red Hawks came to me. Okay? I didn't sign up for this golf job. Fulton offered it and I said yes. My decision. But I show up to work. The same as you. So chill, man. You get a speck of dirt on your pants, and someone dry cleans them. - You would have done the same thing-- - If I was as good as you? - I did not say that! - You didn't have too. - And neither did you. - We didn't vote you captain, because of your jump shots. We did it because you're the guy who usually knows what's up. - But I guess things change. - You think you got me all figured out? Well I don't think so. And I don't answer to you. Well, maybe you should start answering yourself. We have been like brothers since pre-school. If I don't know who you are these days, then who does? Excuse me, you're all being paid to work. Not play Doctor Phil. Table settings, nice. Oh no, no, no. No, no, no! Now that, fabulous. Troy! Daddy will make sure the entire scholarship committee is right here. - Perfect view. - I have already spoken to your mother. They are going to be sitting at a table, right next to ours. It's going to be a fabulous evening. - Come on! - Great. Rehearsal everyone. Places, fabulous! Look, Sharpay. I know I promised I'd do this. But just, take it easy on me, I am kind of new at the whole performing thing. 5, 6, 7, 8... # You are the music in! # # You are the music in, are the music in. # # You know the words, Once upon a time, # # Make you listen, there's a reason, # # When you dream there is a chance you will find, # # A little laughter or a happy ever after, # # Yeah, harmony to the melody It's echoing inside my head # # - A single voice - Above the noise # # And like a common thread Sing it to me! # # When I hear my favorite song, I know that we belong, # # - Because you are the music in me, - Yeah, it's living in all of us, # # And it's here because You are, the music in me, # # You are the music in me. # # You are the music in, you are the music in, # # Harmony, to melody, Echoing inside, my head, # # When I hear my favorite song I know we belong # # - You are the music in me, - It's living in all of us, # # And it's brought us here because, You are, the music in me, # # You are the music in-- # # - You are the music in me. Yeah! - Oh, yeah! # Great job, one second. Great rehearsal, everybody break! You know, Troy. I've always known you were special. And its pretty obvious I am special too. I think we are meant to sing together. Don't you? I need some air. Don't be long! We are going to run it again! Show me what you got! Come on, everybody. Bring it on! Pretty good. Right in the front, here we go. Give it to it, baby! You got it. Flaunt it up! That's it, move it. Come on, come on now. You got it! - Great, man. - Good job. That was great, see ya! - Thank you. - You're welcome. I said, "Keep an eye on them." Not, "Turn them into the cast of Grease!" Pretty cool, huh?! Do you want us to lose the Star Dazzle award... to a bunch of, dish washers? Us? Well, I guess that's showbiz. When did you become... one of those? You know I will take that as a compliment. But you and Troy have a good show, sis. Oh, we plan too. Give me a beat. The midsummer night talent show means something to me, and to my family. Those Wildcats, will turn it into a farce. Your brother is one of those Wildcats, so I am told. Oh, don't you mention that traitor to us. Employee involvement in the show is a tradition here. Traditions change. My parents have important guests coming. We'll need every employee working the party, and not on stage. Pardon moi, but we are not just talking about employees... ...we're talking about your classmates. You might want to think this one out. Alright. Done. Now do it! Distribute these in the staff area but not until the end of shift. - What? Wait, Mr. Fulton. - No discussion, Miss McKessie. This is a business. Welcome to the world of adult, who wish to keep their jobs. Because they have mortgages they wish to pay, tuition bills, car payments etc., etc., etc. So sometimes we have to perform tasks, however unpleasant. That are necessary for them, all too important pay cheques. To land in our all too empty pockets. May I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Fulton? Chamomile, would be lovely. Go Martha, go Martha! May I have your attention, please? You guys, I need to make an announcement. All junior staffers will be required to work on show night. - What? - What? Yes, no staff participation in the show will be allowed. No exceptions. No show? There is a show. We are just not in it. That's great. Sorry, you guys. There is nothing we can do about it. Its Fulton's orders There is no way, this is Fulton's idea. Does Fulton suddenly has blond hair and wears designer flipflops? Excuse me. Sharpay! Forget about the rest of us. How about the fact that your brother, has worked extremely hard on the show? Oh, boo-hoo, he will be in the show. He will do his celebrity impersonations. And don't lecture me about Ryan. Given the way you have been interferring with Troy's future? - What? - You got him written... up by Fulton for sneaking on the golf course. Swimming after hours. I had to step in, just to save Troy's job. I'm not interested in what you... ...think you're doing for Troy. That is between you and him. Your messing with my friends, on my summer. And that's not okay with me. You don't like the fact that I... won. What's the prize? Troy? The Star Dazzle award? You have to go through all this just to get either one? No, thanks Sharpay. You're very good at a game that I don't want to play. So, I'm done here. But you better step away from the mirror, long enough to check the damage that will always be right behind you. Girls! Hey, what do you mean you're done here? You can't quit. Us working together sounded good, but... ...plans change and, people change. This club talent show is a big deal for Sharpay and, evidently for your future. So it's cool, just make it happen. Wear your new Italian shoes. - I'm still me. - Blowing off your friends? Missing dates. If that's you, it's good to know. No, I was only doing that because I am working on the scholarship thing. You know that. What if along the way you act like someone your not, pretty soon, - that's who you become. - I meant what I said. About movies, - and summer and just being together. - I'm sure you did. At the time. I also meant what I said. That I want to remember this summer. But not like this, Troy. # I gotta say what's on my mind # # Something about us, doesn't seem right these days, # # Life keeps getting in the way # # Whenever we try, somehow, the plan is always rearranged # # It's so hard to say, But I've gotta do what's best for me. # # You'll be okay. I've go to move on, # # and be who I am. # # I just don't belong here, I hope you understand. # # We might find our place in this world, someday, # # But at least for now, I gotta go my own away, # # Don't wanna leave it all behind, # # But I get my hopes up, and I watch them fall every time, # # Another color turns to grey, # # and its just too hard to watch it all, slowly fade away, # # I'm leaving today cause I've gotta do what's best for me, # # You'll be okay # # I've got to move on and be who I am # # I just don't belong here, I hope you understand, # # We might find our place in this world someday, # # But at least for now, I gotta go my own away, # # What about us? What about everything we have been through? # # - What about trust? - You know, I never wanted to trust you. # # - And what about me? - What am I supposed to do? # # - I gotta leave but I will miss you. - I will miss you. # # So, I've got to move on, and be who I am # # - Why do you have to go? - I just don't belong here # # - I hope you understand. - I'm trying to understand. # # We might find our place in this world someday, # # - But at least for now. - I want you to stay # # I wanna go my own way I've got to move on. # # - and be who I am! - What about us? # # I just don't belong here, I hope you understand, # # I'm trying to understand, We might find our place, # # in this world, someday, # # but at least for now, I gotta go my own away, # # I gotta go my own away, I gotta go my own away, # Usually your taking these right off the grill. Maybe I have been eating too much at the club. You haven't been out of your room for these last 3 or 4 days, let's call the guys and get a game going. - They wouldn't come, even if I called. - I find that hard to believe. Dad. Do I seem different to you, this summer? You dress a lot better, that's for sure. I'm serious. Maybe my friends are right, I'm turning into a jerk with new shoes. New shoes, not a new kid. Where is this coming from? I have been so focused on my future. Gabriella quit. Chad won't talk to me. I don't see the Wildcats running around here. Is this about going after what you want? Yes, Dad. The scholarship's important, I get it! Look, it's only a big deal if it makes sense to you. I don't even know who I am anymore. You know what? I have known this kid, for a long long time. I have a lot of faith in him. He looks a lot like you. I'm absolutely sure, he's going to figure out the right thing to do. - It's okay, Ryan can help. - I don't know. - We will get it eventually. - Excuse me. # Everybody's always talking at me, # # Everybody's trying to get in my head, # # I wanna listen to my own heart talking, I need to count on myself instead, # # Did you ever? Loose yourself to get what you want, # # Did you ever? Get on a ride and wanna get off! # # Did you ever? Push away the ones you should've held close! # # Did you ever let go? Did you ever not know? # # I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am # # I'll give it all I got, that is my plan # # Will I find what I lost?

What do you mean you're not doing the show? - Exactly that. - We are singing a duet, Troy. A duet means two people. Well, mostly me... - in this case, but still a duet. - I am an employee. Employees are not allowed in the show. - No, no, no, you're an honorary member. - Not anymore. - I asked Fulton for my kitchen job back. - What? Sharpay, I don't like the way you have been treating my friends. I dont like they way I have been treating them either. So, I am doing something about it. An entire table of university producers are coming to see you. - Thanks to me. - So I will be their waiter. They will be thrilled. - Troy, Troy, this could change your life. - I am more interested about... what my friends think of me. And what I think of myself. Oh, we can all hold hands around the camp-fire some other time. - Right now we've got a show to do. - No! You've got a show to do. I got a kitchen to clean. It's okay. Kelsi, find Ryan. Welcome, this evening. You will be seated at table twenty-one. Right, this way. And now, returning with a abridged version of... last year's tap dancing epic. Tina and her tipety-tapety toes. There you are, thank goodness you've came to your senses. - Plug in the volcano. Huma-huma is back on. - Enjoy your pineapple on your own, sis. - I'm not doing the show. - What? Put some fresh batteries in your tikki warrior costume and let's get going. I took your advice, sold it online. You've always wanted the spotlight. Now you've got it. Break a leg. The curtain's up. Showtime! Kelsi told us what went down between you and Sharpay. I'm more interested in what went down between me and you, man. I was a jerk. Yeah! Hey, brothers fight. We're still brothers? Guys, I messed up your show. - And I'm sorry. - Yeah, cause show business is our entire lives, right? Hey, I hope you haven't permanently filled my spot in the two on two game. Ryan, I know how hard you must have worked on the show. Making these Wildcats look good couldn't have been easy. So, I apologise. Hey, truth is, we have all had a lot of fun. At least I have. Hey, you gotta see him play baseball. I'm looking forward to it. Alright! Troy, listen. All these people out there, I--I don't really want to see my sister crash-and-burn. At least I think I don't. I think you should sing with her. My life is over. I've been a good girl. I never lied. Except when necessary. I've always brought my parents expensive gifts. It was with their credit card of course, but... - I don't deserve this humiliation. - You need to get out there. Mrs. Hoffenfeffer and her sock puppet are stinking up the premises. Well, the only thing that would make it any lovelier would be that if I won that Star Dazzle award, Sharpay. I am going to find you, that award. I tell you it is mine. Mine! Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the... Oh, forget it. How's the show going? How's it going? The show makes the captain of the Titanic look like he won the lottery. - I'll sing with you, Sharpay. - What? I promised. And I keep my promises. But what was the first thing you said to me when I started working here? Bring me more ice tea? Think harder. We are-- - All in this together. - Exactly. Well, we are. Let's get out there and knock them dead, Troy Bolton. I do the show, if the Wildcats do the show. And I'd think fast. I just sort of wish you were doing this for me. You're a good guy, Troy. Actually, right now, I think I like you better than I like myself. Did I just say that? Girls! Places. Ok, everyone, Ryan, the show is on. Where is the music? Where is Troy? - Talked to Sharpay, everything's cool. - Hey, speaking of my sister... she wants you to learn a new song. Everyday. I can't learn a new song. - Kelsi'll help you with it. - What? It's showtime! - What team? What team? What team? - Wildcats! Wildcats! Wildcats! # Once in a lifetime # And now, it's time for our five time Star Dazzle Award winner. Miss Sharpay Evans, singing this year, with our assistant golf pro, Mr. Troy Bolton. Where is Troy? - Hey, why'd you switch songs? - Switch songs? What?! Yeah, Ryan said-- - Bolton. - But... I didn't learn a new song. Exactly.
