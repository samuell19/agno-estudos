I LIKE… I LIKE YOU, JUNE. I LIKE YOU, JUNE. I LIKE YOU, JUNE. I like you too, Phing. Destiny. Actually, the movie can end now. But the thing is, Phing is an extra. Not the main male lead. The main lead is standing like a buffoon over there. His name is Guy. But before the story starts, let's get to know the main female lead. June… has lots of followers. She was a cheerleader in her first year. She was in the Angels Squad. Soon, the group fell out because of biological reasons. Most of the girls don't really like her. FAKE! ANNOYINGGGG! During the second and third year, Guy didn't really know her in particular. The two were always bumping into each other. Excuse me, do you have any coins I can borrow? Sure. I do… have a coin. Thanks. Until one day. A magic moment… floated by. A ship was made. My hand was under yours. But now it's not, is it? -Here. -Thank you. Hey. MS. TIM'S MILK TEA I've never thought of you to be someone like this. Like what? Greedy. But we can't equally be at fault. You're more at fault than me. Because I got 450, and you got 500 plus boba tea. Oh, this is to silence me. Fine. I won't tell anyone then. Promise? I thought you wanted to pinky swear. I'm going. Hey, Guy. I need your advice. I'm interested in this girl. Give me a pick-up line. Phing. Are you a high schooler? I haven't seen anyone ever confess their love successfully yet. It's usually casually talking and then becoming an item. I don't know. I'm impatient. I just want to try my luck. Uh… then try this. Walk over to her. Don't say anything. But send her a text telling her you like her in front of her. Sounds good? Damn. That's awesome! You know I'm joking, right? Your mind is anti-anti social network, huh? I know you're deep. Thanks a lot, bro. Sure. Guy didn't understand why that worked. Guy was disappointed that his best friend stole his shot. But the joke is on Phing because Guy knows that Phing never carries an umbrella on him. And this is the beginning of the story. After this, Guy will like June more and-- Damn you, voice over! Stop narrating. Are you God or what? Sure. I don't really like the movie The Classic Because the creator Is mean to the characters Oh, Tah, you came as well? Hi, Master Guy. -Yes, I came. -Are you doing well? Oh, I told June that you're my Master. You came up with that pick-up line. You're quite sappy. I'll take a course with you some time, Master. And how did you become a Master? June. Is this sexual harassment? Let's talk about something else. Guy has three siblings. And they like to teach him how to get girls. Wow. Hey! Awesome. What did they teach you? Tell me. Pretty please. Offer food to girls first. Actually, just the first two bites is enough. She'll then say… -"Oh, it's fine." -It's fine. -"Eat up." -Eat up. That's so true! If someone puts food on my plate, that's what I'd say, too. GREETINGS. Don't type "Greetings," "You're up late," "What are you doing?" "Have you eaten?" Also, don't ask yes/no questions. HEY, WERE YOU IN THIS SERIES? CRAZY! THAT'S AN ACTRESS ARE YOU FREE THIS SATURDAY? Want to go? Go where? Oie. Go anywhere! Eat, watch a movie. A bit more special, the aquarium? The aquarium? That's so meh. Then smoke a joint before going. Hey, what are you doing? Writing on her hand. -Why? -Because I like her. I want to prank her like you told me. And what are you gonna write? "Stupid." No. She just fell asleep while studying, you can't call her stupid. She might be good at other things. What about… "black out"? No one uses words like black, short, fat, skinny anymore. DEAD All right? Umm… Can we? Or not? But… it should be fine. Wow. That's so awesome. It makes me want to have some siblings as well. Actually, not everything can be used. I've been talking with someone for a while now. It's not working out. Actually, there's a way to check what the other person is feeling. I've seen flirts do this often. Let's say you're crossing a road. Usually, people will tug at your shirt, right? But when you're closer, you touch their shoulder… arm… And… next their hand? Wrong. If you grab their hand and they're not into you, it's game over. I think this spot is better. It's between intentional or not. It's a sensitive spot. It's what they call the death spot. Well. If you do it and they don't recoil, then it means you can continue on. But you have to do it naturally. If not, you'll be accused of sexual harassment. June. Tah lost. Your turn. Give it a try. Damn. This isn't right, huh? No. June's got the short end of the stick. She chose Phing. Hey. I mean Phing's in a fix. Don't you know what people are saying about June? About? They're saying June is a slut. She's a flirt and changes guys often. -Oops. -See? -Sorry. -It's okay. -Isn't she just friendly? -No! I'm confused why Phing calls you Master. Listen to what our classmates are saying. -Phing… -Really? What are y'all talking about? Gossiping about me? Uh, we're talking about… -Religion. -Politics. Crypto-currency. Shit. You're so damn smooth, bro. Guy, you're also quite funny. See? We're not even done talking. What a bitch. Right, bro? You're a goner. "Guy… you're also quite funny." Stop it. That's your friend's girl. I put on two different sides and totally different colors. And you know who told me? The motorbike taxi driver. And like, that was so embarrassing. Oh, I just knew today that you're quite funny. It's green. What do you want to eat? I don't know. Hey. Can we sit with you? Sure. -What time do you get out today? -Five. You? I'm done at six. Then, let's watch a movie at seven? Okay. Hey. Why didn't you wait to eat together? Well, you didn't tell me. Do I really need to? I'll wait for you next time, then. Yeah. See? You're sarcastic again. Always being sarcastic. Like I said, next time I'll wait. Where are you going? Sit. Phing, can you stop being a jerk? Jerk? Am I a jerk? Really? Yup. I'm a jerk. Let's just break up then. Huh? Just like that? I'm sorry. I'm always putting my foot in my mouth. Huh? Together again? And what am I supposed to feel? I told you that I'm not like that. I know you're not but… how am I supposed to trust you? I've missed you. I'm sorry. -Stop being a jerk! -I'm not a jerk. You're a brat! What the hell? Am I not enough for you? They're not gonna make it. Let's not be like them. Let me in, Lex. June! June. I know I'm being a broken record. But I really want to change. I think if I'm with you… I can be a better version of me. Let me in, please. -I was explaining it to you! -What? -What the hell are you trying to explain? -You've never trusted me, right? From what I saw, I can't trust you anymore. Then do you want to break up? Let's do it. Just say it. Say it. I'm not breaking up! Shit. PRASERT WITTAYA STATIONERY You're thinking I'm stupid, right? Well, you're not stupid. You're just… a masochist. I just found out that… when he's with you, he's like this. What the hell's wrong with him? Always breaking up. Or should I really just call it quits? Hey. I'm not giving out pointers, but… it depends, do you like to cry or not? You're so sharp, Mr. Knife. Your sharp words have dried my tears up, see? By the way, this is called giving pointers. Hey, I mean it. I'm not good at consoling people. Well. And… why don't you ask your friends for advice? I did used to ask Lex for advice. But instead she told me off. She's easily irritable. Then ask someone else. Hey… don't tell me… you don't have any friends at all? This is so unfair. I really don't understand. "I change guys often"? I've only had two boyfriends. If I don't say anything, then I become a snob. But if I'm friendly, they say I'm a slut. I know the guys who befriend me don't want to be friends. What am I supposed to do? I don't have any friends. No one wants to be my friend! Am I supposed to be careful of what I say with everyone? Why doesn't anyone blame the guys? Guy… how did you let it get to this point? I'll start being a study bug then. I'm going to focus only on my studies. Hey June, what's stuck on your tooth? You're as hideous as a monkey. So damn ugly. Oie. The gods at home. At the university. Buddha statues. Scriptures. Monks. Anything. Send some help please. What? Cockroach. Shit! Shit, on my head? Damn! Guy, aren't you afraid? Where is it? There? Scooch in. HANDSOME. YOUR BROTHER? Tah. Has Guy ever done anything lame? Like seriously stupid? A PERSON OR A DOG? THAT'S ENOUGH. MY PHONE CRASHED. Well… I think I'm someone who's not good at anything. I don't have a clue what I'm going to do after graduation. Like, there's nothing I want to do. Or anything I'm especially good at. It's so damn sad. For me, I don't think so. My older sister is like you. She's constantly changing her job. But she seems happy trying out this and that. Give it a try. Like a reviewer. What about you? Why do you want to be a director? I want to tell stories that can change people's thoughts. -Like-- -Fake. I heard a podcast explaining that these answers are fake. Answer what you really think. You don't need to be cool. I want to have sex with celebrities. That's how you do it! Hey, you. Sorry. June's friend, right? Come here. Don't go in just yet. Look there. Their chemistry is just right. Cute. I mean you. Cute, my ass! I'm not some joke. Guy. Should we join? Oh, never mind. People are gonna talk. Let's just stay put. Then let's go in… and stand apart? Like we came separately. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Look there. They really did break up. I heard June cheated with someone. Can she really not stop herself? Don't you think? Let's… stay out of her business. Why does it seem like you're protecting her? Hey, I'm not protecting her. It's not like we know what the truth is. Right? But Phing's the one who told me. Patty, let's break up. I'm really sorry. But I want to be honest about my feelings. I don't think I really feel anything towards you. Goodbye. I'm sorry. DO YOU LIKE JUNE? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME? Guy! Phing already broke up with June. Stupefied. Plain stunned. Damn it. Fake news. Shit! What the hell? Hey! -What's up, Tah? -Guy, I just met Phing. Phing and June-- SMOKING UPSTAIRS Can I have a cigarette? Jerk, buy it yourself next time. Thanks. Excuse me. Can I borrow your lighter? Nah. The conversation will run out quick. Inside is kinda loud, huh? What are you doing out here alone? Nah. She'll wonder what's with the question. Smoking, of course. If the answers are locked like that, then I'll have to attack. Careful, you'll get cancer. Don't forget to remind yourself as well. But what if it's a dud? Sorry if that was lame. But can you give me your opinion? If you were to rate that pick-up line, what would you give it? Okay, that's possible. Inside is kinda loud, huh? What are you doing out here alone? Farting. Can I borrow your lighter? I'm not really smoking. I'm just here to fart. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry for laughing, but damn, that was really something, Master Guy. Oie. Hey, I'm sorry. Are you mad? I'll treat you to a round of beer. That's enough, universe. If I can escape from this, tomorrow I'll go to temple for you. Hey! You cut me off! All right. Thanks for today. Pete & Friends is really glad to be here. Hey, I like this song. Were you born in time? YouTube, Joox, Spotify, Apple Music. Yeah. You have good taste. What's with the compliment? I like your friend, Lex. -Huh? -A lot. Help me out, will you? Lex might be a bit shy. That's how women are. Right? Huh, talking to the wall. What's on your mind? Do you need to fart? -June. -What? What do you mean by fart? Well, just a while ago-- Well, at least I took my shot. What do those who wait around know? Have you ever taken a shot? Hold it. What are you mad about? Stop blowing your own horn. If you know what to do, then you wouldn't have chosen Phing. Why wouldn't I know how? Do you want me to show you? If you're the big shot, get the number of that guy. I'll bet five baht you can't get it. Make it 500. Deal. Can't you piece it together why June's here by herself? Huh? I called you to tell you Phing and June have broken up. -Like they really are done. -They'll just get back together again. And when you called, why the hell did you start with "I met Phing"? You should've jumped straight to the details, that June and Phing are already over. Crack-head! Hello, bro. Listen to me. It's called introducing the topic. Would most people start the conversation off the bat with something like, "Hello, Phing has broken up with June"? No! I would have to start with, "Hello, I met Phing." And then I asked him where June was. Phing looked really hurt. And that's when I tell you Phing told me he and June have broken up. Right? That's what normal people would do. Damn, that really just made sense. Such an idiot. He didn't give it to me. I was joking. Just for laughs. Bye, bro. June, bye. You don't have to walk me home. I can walk by myself. My dorm is on the way. MR. KANKLAO Damn! What? Damn it, my shoe! Where? -Damn, my shoes! -Hey. Where? Here? June, you don't have to. I'll find it myself. Here! I found it. Nope. Hey, it's fine. I'll take this one. There's no way we'll find it. Are you sure? Yeah. Thank you. Get back safely. Oh, wait. Never mind. I forgot. Thanks for walking with me. Umm. Bye. What's up, Tah? It's cupid, bro. Did you see my present in your bag? Excuse me. I FOUND YOUR KEYS. THANKS. SOMEONE ALREADY LET ME IN. I'LL GET THEM FROM YOU AT THE UNIVERSITY. Uh… Thanks again. No worries. Excuse me. Were you able to make your friend jealous? I like guys, sweetie. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, you don't have to give me your real number. Give me a fake one. I just want to make my friend jealous. -My friend's sitting over there. -Oh. This is not my kind of thing. Go and play at home. Kiddie. No. I guessed wrong. He wasn't jealous at all. You shouldn't feel bad about it. Because… your friend looks kind of perverted. I think he's okay. No? Umm. I'm Pete. -Actually, we've met before. -I'm sorry. You stabbed me with the billiard's stick. I remember now. Yup. See you around. For this song… start with the snare. Okay? I might not sing this song so well. Can I ask for the person who requested it, please come up and sing with me? Come on up. Okay. No need to wave. Come on up. Hey. Just go with it. June is good at choosing losers. She'll break up with him soon. Trust me. Yeah. I'm just annoyed. Doesn't he know that June doesn't like stuff like this? No matter how other people are Even if no one offers a chance On the day you lost and made a mistake Whatever the day is I want you to understand That even if no one loves you Even if no one is interested I want you to hang on Don't waver Even if the stars disappear from the sky Even if those Who say they don't understand… Guy. I have some good news. But please know one thing I think Pete is gay. That I love you OMG! OH MY GIRL OMG! OH MY GIRL 2 Pete's this guy, right? I stalked him. Fine-looking. Loaded. Oh? Then why's he living at the student dorm? Jin, the dorms belong to his mom. Owning the dorms makes him rich? But there's another 30. MALIGOOL MANSION, MALIGOOL COURT, MALIGOOL PLACE He does night gigs as a hobby. He uses his own money to do his music. He doesn't use any of his family's money. He's starting to set himself up. His profile is great. Just give up, Guy. The right person at the wrong time is the wrong person. Try listening to a podcast or meditate. You might become calmer. Why are we interested in this middle class guy who is infatuated with a girl who isn't even his? Does the world revolve around your shit? You don't have to get over being sad. Use your hurt to do something else. Work and become well known. -A girl will come your way. -Jin. That's how to get over someone if you've been dumped. Oh yeah. He wasn't even chosen. True. Everyone… stop talking for a sec, will you? I want you to comfort me. Do I really have to ask? -Aww. -Oh. It's fine, puppy. -There, there. -It's okay. It's okay, my brother. You'll be okay. -Here. -Thank you. The other day I was calm. This time I walked toward him. -And bam! Bam! -Damn! You're fucking awesome. He stayed home and cried. Lex, wait for me. I got a matching pair of floats for us. Should I go pick you up at around… Hey, Guy! -Ban floats! -Rivers are crying. You should tell June how you really feel. Ban floats! Nah. But I think you still can. They've only started their relationship. Nah. That boat has sailed. Believe me. Hey. We're closed. -I think you should con-- -Nah. Buy some? Buy some? Why don't you egg me on any more? Oh? You're such a… Shit! Hey! Watch out, I'll shoot you. Happy birthday to you. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YOU BITCH! Happy birthday, June. Happy birthday. Woo-hoo! Ah-ha. There's someone sad. There's someone not enjoying themselves. June! Guy has something to tell you. Guy, bro! Listen to me. We're about to graduate. What else do you have to lose? TAH'S I like you, June. I know the timing might not be right because you already have a boyfriend. But I just want you to know. And if you're not okay with it… we don't have to mention this again. We'll just continue to be good friends like this. That's fine. Damn it, Tah. I think this is kinda lame. Hey, Tah. Why are you crying? It got me. Forward the clip. I'll send it. Forward. Oh. Damn it! Stop typing and deleting, June! NOW ISN'T THE TIME, GUY. SORRY FOR BEING BLUNT. HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND. I shouldn't have made you send it. It's all right, bro. Thanks a lot. I'm so relieved now. All because of you. I'm really grateful. Why did you drag me here? It's so hot. I haven't eaten anything. I'm gonna faint. I said I'll treat you to lunch. Why are you complaining? Okay. Let's see how it comes out. Let me check. Kie. Kie. Let's go over there. Friend of June's. Let's take photos together. I'll take them for you. -Sure. -Okay. C'mon. Tah said he'll come later and to wait for him. Can you move a bit? Oh, sure. Aren't you going to look before snapping? -I use my feelings. -Sure thing. Is it overexposed? No, it's not. Are you into Top Gun these days? Do you know how to take pictures? I gotta fart. I'm going to the bathroom. -See you. -Sure. Bye. Kie. Is that her? She's cute. Tell her you wear sunglasses because you cried all night. Shut up. Let's go. TRASH / KEEP -Have you been waiting long? -No, not at all. -Do you want to sit up front, sonny? -I'm fine. I can sit in the back. TRASH Welcome to your new life. 1. STOP BEING SAD 2. STOP DRINKING 3. STOP STALKING JUNE'S SOCIAL MEDIA DAY 0 DAY 1 I can cut it. Don't worry. -Are you sure? -Yeah. Jin! DAY 64 DAY 79 What do you wanna drink? DAY 86 What do you have? Shit! You dip-shit, Ball! DAY 245 Nhoom, careful. Wow. Whoa! This one is Dee. -This is Day. -Day. Sleepy heads. DAY 245 Actually… DAY 500 you don't seem to be that into me. DAY 971 DAY 979 Next, a cheerful smile. -Laugh? -Yes, laugh. Good. Looks good. DAY 983 Same place. DAY 1,001 Damn! Shit! Why are you sitting like that? DAY 1,001 DAY 0 Is this your girlfriend? She looks so sweet. If you're free, come to Lex's New Year's party. I miss you. I don't think I can go. I have a lot of work to do. I love you, Guy. I love you too, June. June? Poon. I love you, J-Poon. June. You said June. J-Poon. Have a look. It's okay. -It's okay now, right? -Yes. Okay, pass. It's a wrap. Go home safely, everyone. ARE YOU REALLY NOT COMING? Are you really not coming? -Hey, are you okay? -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! Hey, Lex. -Don't tease. -So cool. How are you guys? I've missed you. Hey, I almost couldn't recognize you. I'll come by to chat with you. -Oh. -Oh. Friend of June's. So you made it. Umm. My work got canceled. You still like her? Yeah. You have a problem with it? -No. -Lil' Tah. Take a photo for me. Sure, Lil' Lex. I'll be back, bro. -Hand it over. -You're so sweet. June. How? Badgering wins over everything else. Good, huh? Tah finally has a girlfriend. Really? I shouldn't have come. Congratulations, God. You won. June… marry me? Sure. What a waste of time. I feel stupid to have thought that one day they'd break up. It's so cliché… to feel regret when I've lost her. Some people like to say if they could turn back time, they'd still do the same thing. Saying it is cool. But let me ask… if you really could turn back time, would you really not change anything? -Pete. -Huh? Well… Well… I don't like things like this. Let's go talk outside, shall we? Sure, of course. Damn, I want to know the ending. Let's call and ask. Hold up. What right do you have to ask her? As a friend! Hey, what happened, June? You can talk to me. You're so damn nosy. No. She already knows you like her. It's too obvious you want something. Hey, do you want to audition? I'm looking for a new face. By the way, why did you turn down Pete? This is just freaking lame. Don't mix your personal life with work. If you want to know, just go ahead and ask. That's the best. Hello, June? June's in the shower. Is it important? Oh, I want to invite June to work with me. Oh, what kind of work? A commercial. A model. Oh, sure. Uh, June's here. It's your friend. -Hello, June. My office is… -Oh, it's still me. June's drying her hair. Here. -Hello? -Hello, June. My office is looking for a new model. Are you interested in working together? For real? I'm not really confident. You'd get 80k. Interested? Hey… Of course. Great. Then I'll tell you the details later. Sure. -Is that it? -Yeah. See you. Stay cool. Stay focused, Guy. You only want to know about her, right? That's right… Finding work for a friend isn't wrong, right? Right… Okay, Guy. You're fine. This person is okay. She's natural. An influencer. She's got 30K followers. Semi-popular. She's fresh. Also, unique face. Hey, is this a dupe? Did you make a mistake? Sorry. Kanin. I like her. I've waited four years. I've given up several times. This is the only chance I'll get to talk with her. If you were to take mercy on me. There's a lot of crying. Can she cry? She's a total crybaby. How do you know? I've seen her do it so many times. Sure. Give it a try. -Okay. -Thanks so much, Kanin. Then I'll call and confirm with her. Do mix your personal life with work. LOVE THE REAR VIEW June, listen. More feeling. Recall the bad things. More, more. Give me more. I need ten times more. Give me some tears. Cut! End slate. Guys, before the next take, clean inside the helmet too. Hey, June. Sorry, but… you just need to do a bit more. Kanin probably wants more. -Why don't you try… -Guy, enough. I'll brief her myself. June, right? Did you know your acting is shitty? Actually, this shot is really easy. All you need to do is cry. Why can't you do it? You're lucky to be born with good looks. That's why you have opportunities more than others. And get a chance at this job. But if you can't do something so simple, then you'll be left with only one thing. Please do something to pass. The entire crew is waiting. Thanks, Guy, for bringing your friend on board. Your friend is such a great actor. Cut. What's next? -Hey! -June! Damn it! June! June! Where are you going? June! -Hey! -Don't run! June! -Let's drink something. -Calm down. -Please wait. -I'm begging you, June. Calm down. It's your fault. What am I going to tell the client? Dad. I don't want to stay in Thailand anymore. Can I go live with you? When I invited you over, you never seemed interested. What does your boyfriend have to say? Did you tell him yet? Not yet. Why are you hiding out in the dressing tent? Dad. Then… I'll call you later. Okay, sweetie. Bye. Hey. Are you sick? I have a slight sore throat. Oh. Sorry for putting you through this. What the director said was right. Pretty but stupid. I'm so damn useless. Actually, being a housewife might be better. That's right. Back then, why did I… turn down Pete? Hey. But I think you did the right thing. Marriage isn't really a bad thing, I guess. It might be something I'm the best at. Sometimes it can be annoying. Why keep on repeating that you'll get married? Why? Why do you pretend like… you don't know that I like you? Are you enjoying this? You like me? When? Since? Hold up. Um, June. You watched my clip… didn't you? -Clip? -The birthday clip. -What birthday clip? -I was playing the melodeon. Oh, I watched it. But was that a happy birthday clip? That's right. I thought you had watched it. It said, "read." And you turned me down. What? What did I say? Really? You told me, "Sorry for being blunt. Now isn't the time." NOW ISN'T THE TIME, GUY. SORRY FOR BEING BLUNT. You sent it to me at four in the morning! It's the middle of the night. I thought it was something important. Instead, I saw a drunk playing a melodeon. And it was shitty. So, when you said, "now isn't the time…" It's 4:00 a.m. Was it really the time? That means, you didn't finish watching the clip? Do I really need to? And why didn't you? For what? I confessed I liked you at the end. What? -Is this real? -Is this real? Back then, I liked you too. But I thought… you made it clear that you just wanted to be friends. Did I? Yeah. Wait. You liked me? Hey, June! Hold on. Let's talk first. June. Hey, June. Don't follow me! Good night, everyone. -Bye. -Bye, June. Hey, June. Wait up! What the hell are you doing? Sorry. Well, you just came out of nowhere. Here. No need. Wait. June. June. June. June, wait. June. Hold on. Oh, you're back? -No… -Stop right there. Thank you! If Pete were a douchebag, everything would be easier. Like in movies where the female leads are cheated on, and the male lead has an excuse for it. -Yeah, drink up. -I don't drink. -He doesn't drink. -It's okay. -He's a musician. Why doesn't he drink? -Here you go. It's fine. Okay? -I'm really sorry. -It's fine. Polite. Why is a musician so polite? Isn't there anything bad about him? Please make me feel less guilty. Stop thinking about it. Kie, please agree. See? Goy has agreed to do it. It's just for fun. This isn't any fun at all. Secretly recording people getting pranked? You've got no taste. It's an infringement of basic human rights. Calm down, will you? It sounds fun. Plus, I get money. Thanks, Goy. My name's Grace. -Just ask him for his number, right? -Yeah. Can I take a picture with you? Oh, sure. Kie, move. Hey. Yes. My place isn't far from here. Damn, Pete is invincible. What to do? HOW TO STEAL SOMEONE'S PARTNER Shit. This world is so crazy. WikiHow teaches you how to steal someone's partner. It's the first thing to come up in the search. HOW TO STEAL SOMEONE'S PARTNER If you can't be the better person, then be bad. Hold up! Calm down! Let's talk. You want money? Take it. -I'll be the baddie for you. -Please, no! EXHIBIT INVESTIGATION SECTION Be more realistic. Or start "Mission: Fake News"? PERVERTED MUSICIAN EXPOSED! Stop! Don't move. Read the computer law! Or make Pete disappear? Hey, Pong. Your pub needs a musician, right? -Yeah, do you have a band? -I do. It's that damn Pete & Friends. I heard them live. They're so good. Interested? Damn, they're expensive. It's not worth it. Hello, Ball? I heard your place needs a band, right? Not me. I opened a car wash. They're upcoming, bro. Pete & Friends. They're da bomb. Tum, help my friend out, will you? Damn you, my place is in Chiang Mai, not Bangkok. What about airfare? Then I'll pay for half. I'll transfer it right now. Why are you so invested? Of course. AVAILABLE BALANCE 50,172.04 AVAILABLE BALANCE 25,172.04 Wait, are you helping them build their house? JUNE'S BIRTHDAY But the date I booked is an important day, Pete. Hey, how can the plates be like that? I wonder too, Pete. It's so funny. You could caption this as… "Inside is all broken. Just open it." What is it with men and quips? Men? Don't stereotype men, will you? Since I'm leaving… Actually, I don't have to go. Well… cancel it. Then… why didn't you tell me? It's a joke. I was joking. Next time, don't say such things. I don't get it. Do you understand? -I won't do it anymore. -Okay. You should go. I'm going for real now. -Do you need a hand? -I got it. Did you know? I did. -And so did you? -I did. And why didn't anyone tell me that Guy liked me? -You're plain stupid. -You're plain stupid. Everyone thought you knew. What do you think Phing and Guy fought about? Over Patty. Oh, shit. I guess you could see it that way. The main point is I'm totally shocked that you like him too. The thing is, you didn't finish watching the clip. Damn. Well, I didn't know it was important. Why are you mad at me? -I filmed it. I have the right to be mad. -Next time, make it shorter then. Fine, my bad. So, what's your next move? See? I'm engaged. Oh, shit. Well, he kept on badgering me. And another thing is, so I don't stray. Oh? Friend of June's. Where are you going? Let's go together. -I'll have to… -Let's go. Come on. -Birthday, birthday. -I have errands… Let's go sing. Hurry. C'mon. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday Happy birthday Happy birthday to you You didn't think I'd come, right? I have a present for you. Happy birthday. Open it. Do you like it? Happy birthday, sweetie. May it be filled with happiness. Thank you. Sorry, everyone. I… I have to go to work. -I'll go now. -See you. Bye. Tah, are you doing well? Yeah, I'm good. How about you, Pete? -I'm doing well. -Okay. Oh, Pete. -Can I ask you something? -Sure. -I'm just asking. -Sure. What if June already had a boyfriend? Would you steal her away? Well, no. No matter how much I like her… I wouldn't. I believe causing trouble for others is wrong. Right? You're so cool. -Don't flatter me. -I really mean it. Hey, are you okay? You look a bit out of sorts. I've been under the weather. So I'm a bit tired. I think I'll take a shower and go to bed. Okay. RELIEF OF SORE THROAT TAH, DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT CLIP? HERE, FINISH WATCHING IT. I like you, June. I know the timing might not be right because you already have a boyfriend. But I just want you to know. And if you're not okay with it… We'll just continue to be good friends like this. That's fine. Hey, Tah. Why are you crying? CAN WE MEET? Would you like to order anything else? It's okay. Okay. Congratulations. Well… I wanted to talk to you about… How should I put this? I'm glad that you like me. But? But… Sorry. I really can't accept your feelings. I… meant for today to be the last day to see you. I want to remember us in a good way. Let's… move on from this. What if I don't move on? Don't joke around. I'm serious. I'm also serious. If you really want to move on, then you can block me. What's the point of meeting? You've already made your decision. So, what do you want me to say? If I were to be honest, it's not that I don't think about you too. You don't know how bad I feel when I think of doing something to make Pete break up with me, or sometimes I want him to even cheat on me. Even though he didn't do anything wrong at all. He's so nice to me. Do you want me to be a bad person? You understand me, right? Thanks. Thank you, really, for… understanding. Well… I'm going to leave now. Wait, hold on. Since it's our last day, have a beer with me. One pitcher and I'll go. Don't laugh. This is all your fault, Guy. When I broke up with Phing, I was totally flirting with you. Nope. Not at all. That's not flirting. I remember. When you were with others, you were so polite. But look. When you're with me… you're so cheeky. See, it's so clear. I'm never cheeky with others. So… why do you like me? Why do women like to ask this question? And you want me to answer right now? It's like romanticizing stealing someone's girl. Hey, you're so annoying. Just answer. Fine, I have nothing else to lose. When… I'm with you, I'm so happy. I've never been with anyone and felt so naked. With you, I feel the world is easy. WANT TO GO TO THE AQUARIUM? You said you understood. I do. You said today was our last day. But 24 hours isn't up yet. Let's go. As friends. WHAT A SLOW POKE, JUNE. YOU'RE THE SLOW ONE, GUY. Ugh. It's been flooding every day. I guess the government is being romantic. Like Venice. Get it? The water's really high. I can't go any further. Get off here, okay? Oh, sure. We'll get off here. Guy, you don't have to come. June. June. June! Don't make it any worse. Choose me. What's wrong with being with me? I'm sorry. Calm down. Why did you do it? -She's the same age as Kie. -I broke up with her. I didn't mean to. I don't have any feelings for her anymore. -It's done with. -Rie caught Nhoom having an affair. I already told you everything, Rie! I admitted I made a mistake. We have kids together! I don't have any feelings for her anymore. I'm sorry. -Get out of here! Get out! -What about our kids? No, Rie. Keep your chump change and get out. -What do you want me to do? -Go! Get out! What about our kids? -I already broke up with her. -Like I said, I can raise them myself. Can you give me a chance? Think of our kids! -Get out. -Feel sorry for our kids. They're mine as well! I'M BLOCKING YOU, OKAY? He's been having the affair for a long time. She posted a picture of them together, and someone sent it to Rie. Maybe she was trying her luck. Nhoom wouldn't make up his mind. So, she set off the bomb. I feel like… I can't continue on. I just can't anymore. I understand everything. I just don't understand. What did I do wrong? You didn't do anything wrong. It's all on me. Pete, you're a nice and good person. Is it because I proposed? Right? It's me who's not ready for a lot of things. I might be too young. I… I don't have a future. I haven't achieved anything. I might be a bit selfish, but… if I'm still with you, then all I'll ever be is "June, Pete's girlfriend." "June, Pete's housewife." I don't like the person I am right now. I'm sorry. These are all the reasons, right? Right? Well? Yeah. It's okay. I understand everything. I do. Don't cry anymore. Want some water? I'll get you some. CAN WE TALK? Don't get up. Sit. Look at this. What's this? Well? Say something! Explain! I'm sorry. Sorry. Hello? Damn it, I'll go. Sorry, bro. What the hell? Damn you. Where's June? She's gone! What the hell did you do, idiot? She left it for you. Hey. Sorry for leaving you this letter. I still don't want to see you for a while. I hope you understand. To tell you the truth, I don't know how I'm supposed to feel. But I can't stay here any longer. By the time you read this letter, I'll probably be gone. And… we might not meet again. What we did, which should have been between two people, has now hurt others. It's bad that it turned out this way. It's not my place to say anything. It's now… time to really move on, huh? I LOVE YOU, RIE. CAN I GET A HUG? I want you to be happy with your life. Good luck. PATED TALK PETE SHADING HIS EX WITH TEN MILLION VIEWS JUNE WITHOUT JUNE So, for the most awaited question, which is inevitable. FIRST COMMENT When you put your ex's name in the song, at the time, what were you thinking? THEY'RE BOTH TRASH SINCE UNIVERSITY Well… BINGBING SUSU: YOU'RE HANDSOME …actually, it's not hard at all. I just hate her. That's all. Okay, sure. PETE'S COOL STYLE FASHION IMPORTED FROM KOREA You're such a prick. Thanks so much. Really, thank you. Thanks for coming today. Hope to see you again. Excuse me. Was it noisy inside? What are you doing out here alone? Farting. Did you get this from an Internet meme? I've seen it. Hey, you might be the first person to know of this. If you don't mind, can I have your number? Sure. But just so you know, I have a boyfriend. LEX AND TAH THEME: WEAR ANYTHING YOU WANT BUT DON'T FORGET A MONEY ENVELOPE Ah-ha. You thought I was going to propose, huh? Lex, I'm joking. Surprise! That's it. Yeah, I know. I already told you I can't go. But this is my wedding. Do I have to beg you? Bro, I already went to your engagement party. Hey, I'm busy at the moment. I'm having dinner with my family. You're afraid of running into June, right? No. I'm fine now. What about June? Is she okay seeing me? She's not coming back from London anymore. So, now can you come? Sure, I'll go. See? That wasn't so hard. Hold up. You're tricking me, right? Damn! You've gotten smarter. Yeah. Sure. -I'm not going. -Guy-- If there're no feelings, then go. That means there're feelings. Not feeling is feeling. -Feelings. -Feelings. I said I don't have feelings. I just don't wanna feel awkward when we meet. Great, huh? Guy's finally moved on. Right? One, two, three. A round of applause, please. Let's go for it. Kiss on the cheek. Can you feel a little shy? There's a small request from one of our guests. They'd like Tah to carry Lex like a princess. Can you? Easy. -Really? -Yup. -Are you confident? -I can carry her for three hours. Three hours? CAN WE TALK? INCOMING CALL Hello? Hello. It's okay. Are you ready? So… what is it? Well, Tah told me you're not going to his wedding because of me. Hey. That's not true. Let's try. And turn around too. Be careful not to trip on the carpet. Really? Then, can you go? I don't want to cause any trouble between you and Tah. Did Tah ask you to call me? Well, yeah. It's one reason. Okay, let's now watch Lex and Tah's presentation, right now. And the other reason? I just wanted to let you know first in case we run into each other. It'd be awkward, for sure. Isn't this weird, you telling me it'll be awkward if we met? Well, it is. I just want you to prepare yourself, that's all. I think my feelings towards you still aren't normal. June… I'm sorry about what happened with Pete and for getting you into trouble. All of it. Hey. You don't have to apologize. I'm also in the wrong about this because I was also playing along. No matter what, I still want to say sorry. I'm the cause of it, right? Why are we fighting over who's wrong? Actually, there are good things about it. I've never had to rely on myself this much before, which has made me like myself much more. Thanks for choosing me, Lex. One reason I didn't talk to you is because I wanted to stop thinking about the past. Sorry for disappearing. Yeah. I understand. Singles ladies, come to the front. Come on. Don't be shy. June. Can I ask you something? -Let's toss it. -Toss it now. What? From all the things that happened to us, even if most of it was bad, but there were some good things too, right? Three, two, one! Toss it! If one day you feel okay with me, can we be friends again? Of course. Promise? Promise. RELIEF OF SORE THROAT Thanks. For what? Thanks for calling. I have no more regrets. Good to hear. I'll see you then. See you. We're married! It's lame. Stupid. Why is my life filled with these thoughts? -You're so lame. -That's who you are. That's right. -So lame. -It's fine. Everyone understands you. -It's fine. It's normal. -Really? -June's old enough. She understands. -That's good. Is that it? -Can you go? -I think we'll be late. We need to talk. Why? What? RELIEF OF SORE THROAT How did you get this? I thought I got rid of it. Well… It's still usable. Why get rid of it? Don't think it means anything. Thank you, God. Guy thinks to himself. I secretly wrote a song for a friend to play on my wedding day. He has loved the same girl for a very long time. No matter how long it is… Hold on. I forgot the lyrics! I'm nervous. No matter how long it is My heart is still with you No matter how long it is I still miss you every time No matter how long it is The memories still linger No matter how long it is No matter how long it is I thought my love has ended Not seeing you would make it fade away But it never ends It feels like my long journey Is erased after seeing you… Again No matter how long it is My heart is still with you No matter how long it is I still miss you every time No matter how long it is The memories still linger No matter how long it is Subtitle translation by: Karina Suvapataya
