A touch of innocence She's my daughter. I want to see her. -You're Mrs. Cardot? -Yes! Let me see her! Calm down! You can go upstairs. Your daughter's waiting. Julie! I was so scared! My Julie! My Julie! Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you? I did it, Mom. The preceding Sunday... Mom, they're here. -There's an extra place setting? -No, it's for Boris. -I've seated him opposite me. -Oh, yeah. Boris. Since his real father's a sailor, we'll need to build a jetty. I told you, remember? -He's a foundling. -You mean he's adopted? No, he was found. His father's a famous skipper, so he'd like to find him. There wasn't a soul on the road. It took 19 minutes door-to-door! -I made apple pie for a change. -That's great! -Julie, you forgot the bread. -I'll get it. -Hi, kiddo. -Hi. Are we waiting for someone? -Yes. It's not impossible. -It's just not certain. His father's a sailor. But he'll try to come. His name is Boris. But we can start without him. What's his last name? The chicken! I'll be right back! Julie, serve your aunt! The signing will be at 2:30 at the seller's notary's. I wrote the address on the file. If he forgets, ask him for... The commission check to be handed to you personally. Can I go to the creek to see about the jetty, Mom? Thanks. Who's Boris? Have you ever met him? That'd be hard, since he doesn't exist. It's like that invisible mouse when she was little. You remember? -Do you need me? -No, thanks. Just relax. DANGER DO NOT OPEN When my mom wants me to be quiet, she crosses her legs, even unconsciously. For my psychology research, I need look no further. Have you seen these horrors? My mom has a superego that rarely hinders her id. She's ideally intrusive. Could you close that? Julie hates people looking at her drawings without permission. I can't believe this! Don't you think she needs limits? She's always alone, has no one to supervise her, and no one to talk to. I can't afford a babysitter. You know the town let a slum form at the edge of the forest? Not far from here. Your point? You could lock your doors. Meaning what? Homeless people and Arabs are all thieves? Call me a racist while you're at it! You married an Algerian and he dumped you. -Don't start that! -Sorry, but there are limits. What limits? Sorry, Marie, but I'll go find Julie. It's not always easy, is it? All right. Want to take a walk? Julie? Julie, I can hear you. May I come in? No! We could enjoy the sunshine and go to the beach. No! I could help you build the jetty. No, that'll be Boris and me. We can talk, can't we? Don't move! I'm coming. You miss your brother, that's normal. But living in an imaginary world won't help. Boris, the son of that "sailor," you invented him, didn't you? You can tell me. Marie! Your daughter locked herself up in the attic. -In the attic? -All kids like attics. Oh, so that's where she found all those Japanese horrors: in her brother's things! I find it totally unwholesome. Farida! How did you do that? There was a broken glass in the sink. -Do you have bandages? -It's OK, it isn't deep. Press hard to stop the bleeding. There are many renovations to be done, but for a secondary residence, it's ideally located and easy to access. It's like in love: Falling head over heels is a good indicator. My husband and I found a very big house without any heating, in the middle of a pine forest. We never regretted it. Does your husband also work in real estate? He died. But I still live there with my daughter, and we're happy there. Look. I prefer this one. -It's a little expensive... -But it has character. It has a private beach, doesn't it? A handy thing for your boat. Wait till you hear... sorry! Florence Cardot, my sister-in-law and director. Mr. Murat. No, sorry! Mr. Roussel and Miss Murat. Hello. We were talking about the Sablons property. Excellent! Huge potential. A must-see. Dominique, have you seen the time? -Do you have a business card? -Of course. Here is my card. My cell phone number is on it. Thanks a lot. -Are you coming? -Goodbye. Goodbye. -They're not from here? -No, from Bordeaux. -Budget? -Five hundred thousand. I've had the fright of a lifetime. I was lucky not to have been taken hostage. The post office was held up. The guy was alone, but armed. -He escaped out the side door. -You saw him? It happened just before I came, but the police were there. I think they wounded him. Imagine if I'd come sooner! I'm like my daughter, no imagination. Good thing nothing happened. I'm off. See you tomorrow! How's it going, sweetie? I finished my homework first. It's pretty good. Look. I traced the ship and octopus, but the rest is mine. The boy is Boris. Not bad. Boris is cute. -He wears glasses? -He's near-sighted. I see. Will you help me with dinner? On my signal! Your turn, Julie. Don't be scared, Julie. Walk to the front. -Breathe and don't look down. -Jump! Look forward, not down. C'mon, Julie. We're waiting. Jump, Julie! Go on! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump, Simon! Go, Simon! Simon! Simon! Simon! Simon! Well done, Julie! Now go change. I signed my daughter up for swimming, -not acrobatic diving lessons! -Can't you read? Hey! Are you all right? You should've told me about her brother. I'll be careful. Good thing Julie's learning to swim. Facing your fears is always the best solution. -I'm sorry. -We're both sorry. I know my way back. -Thank you. Here. -Can I have a waffle too? No, you won't be hungry after. -How much? -Two euros, please. I hope the movie is scary. Did you see how I dived? The important thing is to know how to swim. I'd like to learn to snorkel. If it's not too expensive. I think we can afford it. -Great! -Goodbye! -Where are we eating after? -At a little bistro I know. Their specialties are brains with rat-tails. -Yuck! -And pig trotters in cream. Yuck! They also make gigantic pizzas. -They do? -Yes. Do you think they let young witches in? -Do I leave this here? -Yes. We had fun, didn't we? -I'm taking this. -Got everything? Yes. I just have to put on the parking brake. The scene with the skeletons really freaked you out! No, I knew they weren't really dead. But you crushed my hand. What's this? Is it yours? Boris left it. We found it in the sand. Wait. Let me go first. Didn't we close the door when we left? Anyone there? If anyone's there, show yourself! Julie? Julie, where are you? Julie? Julie, are you up there? -He's not there. -Who, Boris? No, Gildas. Boris is too shy. Gildas, on the other hand... So now it's Gildas? Original name. That's not all. He's old too: at least 17. But he doesn't mind me being little. He's a magician. Where does he come from? I'm not allowed to tell because he's in serious trouble. He was wounded by mean people chasing him. I helped him hide so they wouldn't kill him. Julie, what's this story? A story. It's late. I need to go to bed. Goodnight. -Julie... -Yes, Mom? -It's nothing. Goodnight. -Goodnight, Mom. What are you doing, Mom? Nothing. Just putting some things away. What are you doing there? Go back to bed. Thanks, Franck. See you tomorrow. I gave you Roussel at 6 PM at the Sablons place. -It means I'll be home at 7:30. -They can't come earlier. -I could take care of Julie? -Thanks, but no. I'll tell her to call you if she feels lonely. It's kind of you. You're still there? -I'm sorry for being late. -That's all right. -You're alone? -Yes. Please excuse me. Hello? That's the kitchen, fully equipped, even with an ice cube maker. -Gold taps. -Yes. -There's certainly a theme... -A decided one. Yes. But it's all high quality. Don't you want to see inside? What do you have that's exactly the opposite? I'd have to check. We have a pretty little farm near Laumières, which I like a lot. It's on one storey, well-lit, simple, unaffected but comfortable. Perfect! It's like you. I wouldn't know about that. The simplest would be if you called the office tomorrow so we could schedule a visit. I have errands to run, so I have to go. -Thank you. -So I'll expect your call. Of course. Julie, open this door immediately! This is Simon's place. He doesn't want you here: He told me so. Even Mom doesn't come in. She's too scared. I don't like it when you're like that. Be nice and come out! I'll wait for you downstairs. You were there? Good thing you're here: You'll help me unload the car. -Julie, are you coming? -Yes. That's hardly new. She's always had imaginary friends. I'm not talking about "friends." She talks as if Simon is there. Julie, is that you? Have you looked at these drawings? She takes real things, then exaggerates and deforms them. You might say: "Why not?" But if she starts believing in them, like in these ghosts of hers, then it's pathological. Imagination is a sickness now? Have you seen the time? Damn! There's still a bag in the entrance. OK. Julie! Have you been there long? Why'd you tell Farida that Simon is in the attic? So she'd leave me alone. "You miss your brother. It's normal." We just want to be left alone! What's this, anyway? You found this in the attic? Dad must've hidden it there. We didn't exactly agree on this. -Did he teach Simon to shoot? -Yes, he taught him. -Will you teach me? -Certainly not! -Now go do your homework. -All right. -Wait! What's this? -It's nothing. I mean it! Simon! Mom! -Mom! -I just had a nightmare. Why did you call out for Simon? -Was he dying in your dream? -No... I don't know. Come here. Maybe Dad will come back someday. I don't think so. Go to sleep. Julie, the bus won't wait! -What time is it? -Check your watch. -I lost it. -You lost it? -If it's Farida, she'll pay. -Julie! -Are we ready? -Yes. -What's this? -Just clothing for Julie. Two or three nice things. I gave you another appointment at 6. Sorry. Roussel again, this time in Laumières. Shall we go? I tried to understand why Julie couldn't make friends at school. Oh, yeah? She's not like others because she doesn't dress like others. -Come see. -What? When did you take that? Look: It's Simon's jacket along with his big watch. It's Simon. And look: Only horrible things happen. Sure, like in all mangas. You seriously think you'll change Julie by dressing her differently? What I think is that you put your head in the sand when it comes to your daughter. Did I tell you I talked with her principal? -No, you didn't. -Like me, she's worried. She finds Julie charming and creative, especially in drawing, even gifted. But ill-adapted. Those are her words. I give her too much freedom, is that it? -I've got rules. -You know the word? Clear but flexible ones. I don't want to format my daughter. And it works because we trust each other. She lies to you. Did you notice this? They'll have to lower the price. Too dangerous! People like you provoke disasters. How so? When you cry wolf, you end up attracting one. -Hello, dear. -Mom! -Have you eaten? -Don't worry. So everything's fine? What's that barking I hear? That's Balthazar, Boris's dog. He's all white and fury, with a spot on his eye. Adorable! -All right. -We'll have a snack. Bye, Mom! See you later! Love ya! Well, here we are... -I'll let some light in. -I doubt it'll be necessary. Just shut the door on your way out. I don't know where your daughter is, but I can't wait. I'll leave the bags in front of the door. You can tell her they're from me. I gotta go. Mom will be here soon. -Julie? -Mom! Good thing you're back. -Who were you talking to? -The ducks. I told them I'd come back tomorrow. I'm cold. Let's go. Where were you when Florence dropped by? Why did you tell me you were at home when you weren't? I never said I was at home. I said I'd have a snack with Boris. Anyway, it's over with Boris. He kept on saying I was richer than he. Maybe he stole my watch! And I didn't really like his way of... -Of doing what? -Just his airs. But Gildas is tall with long hair. He's very bold. He has a motorcycle and does card tricks! -He has a motorcycle? -You don't believe me? No motorcycle, whether real or imagined, you hear? Never! You're drenched! -You didn't swim alone, did you? -No. But at the pool, they told me I could pretty soon. You never believe me anymore. I believe you. Of course I do. You're not alone. I don't care what neighborhood it is, but the floor is important. The two first floors make me claustrophobic. The ideal would be a top floor with no facing building. A terrace. I'm not saying no, but... I'll call you tomorrow and we'll visit something else. I'm sorry, but I'm awaited somewhere else. I'll call you. Go on in! Show your mother! -What's going on? -This. Not to mention the boy who goes with it. -It's not true. -Don't cut me off! Know the stairs going down to the jetty? I was going to walk down, to check if Julie was in the shed. I wanted to know if she'd tried the clothes. I see a motorcycle stop on a path 50 m away. Your Julie was on that motorcycle, dressed as you see, pressed against a boy twice her age... nearly an adult. She kissed him before getting off. Not true! You're making it up! You saw nothing! You're just mean! Julie! Is the motorcycle true? -You promised me. -It's not true, and I promised nothing. You asked me: It's not the same. -You knew about this? -About what? My daughter having imaginary friends? At least it suits her age level. -You think I could be lying? -Yes. Because there's no road around there. Julie, go outside, please. I tell you that Julie was on a motorcycle dressed like that. Maybe you don't want to know that she's in danger. But I won't drop the matter. Listen, Florence. If you snoop around again, if you touch a hair on Julie's head, if you humiliate her like you just did... ...I'll make you pay so dearly! I'm sorry if I've been tactless. But I couldn't stand anyone hurting either of you. Julie! Come down. We need to talk. Yes, Mom. Julie! Come down! What are you doing? I'm changing. I'll be right there. Julie! Why did you change? And what are these two bowls? Gildas was supposed to come, but then that loony showed up! Could we talk later? I gotta go. -Go where? -Nowhere, just the hut. Please! It's super important. The bad guys could kill him. I told you, remember? We have to find a boat, too. I'll explain, but let me go... Stop it! I want the truth! Is Gildas real or not? It's not the right time. I gotta go, please! No! Sit down! Did you really ride a motorcycle when I told you not to? With Gildas or someone else? And what are you doing at the hut? Stop fidgeting, you won't go out tonight. You never spoke to me like that before. You used to trust me, and I could tell you everything. This is all Florence's fault! I don't care, I'm going anyway. You're not going anywhere! And we're changing the rules. I'll hire an au pair girl. She'll stay here until I come home. Any friends will have to come here to eat or play. I need you to promise that you won't go out without permission. And your cell phone has to be always on. -Do you promise? -Yes, I promise. But please don't hire anyone to watch me. No, Julie. I don't trust you anymore. -Where are you going? -To bed. If you wanna know, Gildas doesn't even exist. Coastal Agency, hello. No, Ms. Cardot is away for the day. Could I help you or take a message? Yes, she'll be here tomorrow morning. Goodbye. This is Julie. Leave me a message. Julie, it's Mom. Call me as soon as you get home. Bye. Coastal Agency, hello. See you tomorrow, Franck. It's on the seventh floor. Seven floors. A bit high, isn't it? A bit. Feel free to browse the file. Please excuse me. -I need to talk to you. -Could it wait? It could. But I wanted to tell you I've left Janice. For me? Are you crazy? Have you thought of my life or me? I should fall into your arms because we slept together? -I don't care about you. -You'll see, you do. This is Julie. Leave me a message. Julie, I asked you not to turn your cell phone off. I don't know what's going on, so I'd like you to call me ASAP. I'll come back when you have some time for me. -Goodbye, ma'am. -Goodbye. Florence? You've reached Florence Cardot's voicemail... -Hello? -Farida, it's Marie. -Know where your mother is? -Why? Do you know where your mother is? I think she wanted to visit Julie. She's my daughter. Julie! I was so scared! My Julie! My Julie! Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you? I did it, Mom. You didn't do anything. The body at the foot of the stairs is that of your sister-in-law, Florence Cardot. I believe the gun is yours. According to your daughter's testimony... You interrogated her? She's 11! Eleven! She's too little to hold a gun! -Calm down. -Can I go to the bathroom? Julie! Please help me. Breathe! She should be under medical supervision for the night. So you're a doctor? I forbid you to take her away! All she needs is her mother. -And quiet. -Did anyone ask you? -I'd better go with them, Mom. -Easy, dear. -Will I see her tomorrow? -Of course! Your mom can see you whenever she wants. -I'll go with her. -No. It'll be fine. Don't worry. See you tomorrow, Mom. Could you prepare a sleepover bag? Your teddy! We need to ask you a few questions, ma'am. -Marie, are you going to bed? -Yes, I'm coming. Try to sleep. -You should rest. -Yes, I'll be right there. -What are you doing? -Tidying up. You should try to sleep. After what we did to Julie? You mean after what she did? I'm sorry, but I don't believe it. Someone else did it. She's lying. When it suits you, she's lying. When she draws, she's inventing. When she says she has buddies, it's true. But when she says she killed, it's not true anymore. Julie is sick, and you're losing it, Marie. Maybe. But I know Julie. Florence is dead. Dead! But you don't care! You don't care about my mother or me! As usual, only your precious daughter counts. I don't believe it. No one cares what you believe, Marie! My mother is dead! I was alone. I heard noises. I wanted to hide in the attic, but someone was on the stairs. I was very scared. I took the gun in Mom's drawer. I fired. I didn't see it was Aunt Florence. I'm not allowed to show you this. You never saw it. Julie, it's Mom. I'll wait all my life, if necessary. It's nice of you to come. You'd help Julie by facing the truth. -She stopped drawing, you know. -I know. That's a great improvement. How can you say that? Drawing is her life. She asked my forgiveness... I don't know how many times. -She talks to you? -To me, yes. What did she say? Nothing. Let's not talk about it. What would be the point? -Dr. Folin's department. -This is Mrs. Cardot. Remain on the line, I'll get her for you. Thank you. Julie? It's Mom. Julie, are you there? I can hear you breathing. Julie, even if... I'll be with you always, no matter what happens. When you're ready, I can hear whatever you want to tell me. Anything. If you don't want to talk to me, that's OK. I love you, Julie. We'll make it through this, I swear. I have faith in you. I love you, darling. It's my fault, Julie. It's my fault. Know the stairs going down to the jetty? I see a motorcycle stop on a path 50 m away. -Not true! -You think I could be lying? Yes. Because there's no road around there. Balthazar? -Balthazar, heel! -Balthazar's your dog? -He's so cute! What's your name? -Igor. Igor. I'm Julie's mother. Don't know her. -Come. -Wait a minute. -What do you want with him? -Nothing. It's his watch. -What about his watch? -Sorry. I'm Marie Cardot. I live on the other side of the forest. -I'm Tony, his cousin. -Nice to meet you. -What the deal with the watch? -It's the same as my daughter's. It was her brother's, but she lost it. She said she had a friend named Boris, so I thought... -Igor. -No, it's OK. You said you'd found that watch. Give it here. Hope it's yours. Igor, into the house. Go away now. Why did you bring that woman here for? I met Balthazar today. He's very cute, you were right. I also met Igor. You call him Boris in your story. He gave me your watch back. I'll bring it over. I also saw Gildas's motorcycle. I know why you fell for it it's spectacular. Maybe he doesn't know what happened to you. Wouldn't you like to find him? What's the matter? Did I make you cry? I'm sorry. I won't talk about that anymore. I only wanted to... I know that... ...you were telling the truth. I believe you. But I'm certain you didn't do anything wrong. That's why you won't tell me anything, 'cause you wouldn't lie to me. An abandoned bike is no proof. Julie herself told me Gildas didn't exist, as did you. -Julie recognized that fact. -She's lying! She's afraid. She was seeing him, 'cause she cries whenever I say his name! He's a key witness and might know who killed your mother. You're hurting your daughter by refusing to see the truth. That's why she won't talk to you. What about you? Why do you go see her? Because she's innocent. What? Farida. You're not a criminal when you're eleven. She did what you wanted: to get rid of your enemy. You're responsible. So I visit her, because she's sad for me, and has remorse. Hello? -Is this Julie's mom? -Yes. Why? Ask your daughter where she put my money. I'll call back. What? Wait, what money? Is this Gildas? If you talk to the police, she dies. No, wait... Farida! -Where's my daughter? -We gave her sleeping pills. -I want to see her. -Let's take a walk. Come. Your daughter has violent mood swings. We must be patient. But we're taking good care of her, -so she's in no danger. -Are you kidding me? Since she's arrived here, her aggression is aimed at things, never at herself, as if trying to break down the silence -that's keeping her locked. -She talks to me! -You're in denial. -No, you are! She didn't wreck her room! Gildas did it! Her drawings reflect reality. I don't know how or where she met him, but he's real! He called and threatened me! It's possible Julie's troubles stem from your family's past, what with her brother dying and her father leaving... A few sessions of family therapy would do you good. Your niece said she'd be in favor of that. Call my office to schedule an appointment. I'm counting on you. Mrs. Cardot? We would like to talk to your ex-husband. He has to be informed, whether you want to or not. Don't count on me then. Nobody knows where he is. "Gildas doesn't exist. He never has. "Everyone knows that, everyone says that. Even Mom." I'd prefer if he were real. You're the last to believe that. Sadly, crime victims often get calls from pranksters. I'll have a look into this bike thing, but... ...don't expect too much out. Probably stolen. You could at least interrogate this Tony. -'Cause he lives in a trailer? -He might be Gildas. Igor and Boris are hiding something. My daughter's too scared to talk. They've been to her room. -Call 'em! -Let us do our job. I called Dr. Folin. We're here to help you. I mean, he'll help you. -I'll see you out. -No, thanks. DON'T BE AFRAID TO GO UNDER. I don't want to bother you. It won't take long. I have contacts and some money. How can I help you? -Do you need a lawyer? -I don't need anyone. Especially not you. Neither does my daughter. I'm sorry. Leave me alone please. I don't need anyone's help. Come here, Balthazar! Hi. Just the person I'm looking for. I just saw Julie. -She talked about you. -What did she say? That you gave her a flashlight, that Boris is in fact you, that she drew you in her mangas. Oh, and I'm sorry. Seems she really did give you this watch. She asked me to give it back to you. -Did she really kill someone? -No. No one. Balthazar, fetch. Is it true one of your friends' a magician? No, she made that up. -Balthazar, come. -Is your father a sailor? No. The last time she came... She wanted to have a dog. Is it true you hate your job? Yes, it is. She told me if you found a treasure, you wouldn't have to work anymore. -And the last time you saw her? -She stopped coming. Another one of her fancies. She found a new friend and wanted to buy a boat with his treasure. Did you ever go play at our place? No. She said there were ghosts in the attic, and nobody could go. She scared me sometimes. -Gotta go. See ya. -Wait a minute, Igor. Wait. What were you afraid of? -Of Gildas? -Balthazar, stop. Igor. I was starting to wonder where you were. Your daughter finally talked. That's good. Gildas? You nuts or what? I'm Tony. Tony, not Gildas. Shut up now. Let me take my share and I'll leave. OK? -This money's yours? -Parts of it. What's it doing in my house? Ask your daughter. Now let me count, OK? Gildas... -Tell Gildas I left his share. -Gildas? You know him? Everyone thinks I made him up. Tell him to come back. -He'll be back. -Tell him! He won't leave you his cash. That murder scared him. No, please. For my daughter, before it's too late. -To each his own. -Please, wait! Tell me. Please, I don't get it. Get me a drink. -How old is your friend, Gildas? -Associate. He's 17. He does hold-ups, right? No. He's a card player. He's amazing at it. I get him money and he find a place to play. He's a magician. He walks away with three times what we bet. But last time, I bet my own money and he lost everything. Kid says he made a mistake. But what am I supposed to do? I gotta pay my backers. So I had to put pressure on him. What a moron. Did I ask him to hold up a post office? No sir! -So that was him? -Of course. Wham bam, deal's done. And now the cops are looking for me. What am I supposed to do? I'm in shit now. You're pretty, you know that? Relax! I'm a man of my word. I got my money. You'll never hear from me again. But if you talk, I'll whack you. Tell that stupid kid I don't ever wanna see him again. -Could he be hiding nearby? -In the forest? He wouldn't last two days. Igor showed me your daughter's hiding place. It's falling apart. Not even a magician could get in. Gildas? Are you in there, Gildas? Anyone there? DON'T BE AFRAID TO GO UNDER. Marie? Are you getting any warmer? You're OK? I'll call the cops. You can count on me. Trust me. I want to help you. Ma'am. Gildas Pirès was probably killed with the same weapon that killed Florence Cardot. If so, we'll have to interrogate your daughter again. I'm sorry. I didn't think about anything. I arrived, I dove underwater and went through the trapdoor. Could you direct our man to the location of Gildas Pirès's body? In the cabin? -Yes. As if you'd already dived in. Mom! It's all right. Your mom's OK. Julie! I'm OK. Julie, what happened in that cabin? Gildas wanted to get his treasure back from the attic, before Mom hired the au pair. Stay here. I'd shown him Dad's pistol. He was teaching me how to shoot at the beach. He had it in his pocket to protect his treasure. He left the attic and went down the stairs. Who's that stupid cow? She was about to call the cops! Julie! I'm sorry. Don't think about it. It was nothing. It was just a bad dream. It'll be OK once we wake up. He touched me all over and put his tongue in my mouth. He was on top of me, but I didn't want to. So I fired. I wish Gildas had never been real. We were in love. We really were. Julie... Are you sad? -Nice of you to say goodbye. -I hope it's not farewell. I might stay at the bottom of Mt. Fujiyama forever, you know. Man lives on hope. With a little luck, it'll be cold and dreary. Well... time to go. Have a nice trip. So? -Wasn't there a cabin before? -Yes. We had it torn down. It was too dangerous. -Can we see the house again? -Of course. It's yours now. -We'll wait for you up there. -We're going to the house. -You coming? -In a moment. Can I see? -Is that me? -No, it' a drawing. -I know. -You'd look good with long hair. -Mom! Stop right here. -Wanna bring him with us? Translation: TV5 Québec Canada
