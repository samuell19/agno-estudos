- Gingerbread loaf for Hazel! - Oh. Yeah. Hi. Sorry. Yeah, that's me. Oh. Thank you. Have you had this loaf before? It is so good. - I don't do carbs. - Oh, okay. These days Mark Clemmons is known in kitchens across America as the Cookie King of Chicago. I have a very big announcement. - You do? Oh, tell us. - I do. As you know, every December Chicago holds the Christmas Bakeoff. I have the pleasure of being the judge for this year's theme, a gingerbread showdown. I love it! We are gonna have edible works of art that require originality and an architectural precision. I'm really happy to announce that Clemmons Cookware will be donating the prize money to this year's winner, a $100,000! Hundred-thousand dollars? I'm-I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. But that's, like, an insane amount of money for a baking competition, right? Oh, I don't work for the money. I work because I make people smile. Oh, oh. Yeah. Okay. - Are you nervous? - I mean, a little. It is my last day as a consultant. Starting next week, hopefully your first day as a brand-new full-time architect. Oh, I hope so. Huh, I bet you're the smartest, hardest-working consultant they have there. There's no way they're giving that job to that ding-dong. Well, he's not a ding-dong, dad. He went to Harvard, which he has told me numerous times. Don't get too wrapped up in your fancy new job. I still expect you back home for Christmas. Don't worry. I'll be there. All right, I better head on in. - I don't wanna be late. - Love you, kid. Love you, too, dad. I got this. Sorry. The main thing I'm worried about is the clear story over here. I suppose the arched ceiling will need to be reinforced by columns to support the skylight. What if we used steel T-shaped columns instead of reinforced concrete? That would make it cheaper, and plus, it'll fit the design aesthetic they're looking for. You had me at cheaper. Um... We have enough time to change the model before tomorrow? Yeah, sure, it'll only take a few hours with the 3-D printer. Great. Benjy-Boy, can you handle that? Only if we can hit Annie's after for Margarita Mondays. - I'm taking a client. - Good. All right, everyone. That gives us two weeks to wrap up everything before Christmas and family time. Let's hop to it. Nice input today, Hazel. - As always. - Thank you, sir. Actually, about that, I don't mind changing the design myself. I know Ben has been super swamped lately, and I secretly kind of love using that 3-D printer. - Hazel... - And I can stay late again. Just to make sure everything is perfect. I appreciate you burning the midnight oil. Believe me, your hard work hasn't gone unnoticed, but before you pull another all-nighter and sleep under your desk again... You scared the cleaning team, by the way. They're usually not so thorough. You should know I'm giving the job to Ben. I'm sorry. If we could hire you both, we would. We just think that Ben's a better fit for the team. He plays well with others. And you are a fantastic architect. And when you undoubtedly get hired by another firm, they're gonna be lucky to have you. I'll, uh... I'll, uh, leave you to it. It is so good to see you, Nina. Oh, you, too, honey. You know, when I said I needed something sweet, I figured we could just pick something up. I didn't mean for you to bake for me. Yeah, I got the impression from your text this called for something homemade. Yeah, you're not wrong. - Everything okay? - Oh, not really. I got some pretty bad news at work today. I didn't get the job. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I know how much you wanted that. - Yeah. - What happened? Apparently, not being named Benjy-Boy happened. Well, thank heavens for that. Fortunately, I brought the big guns. We got some double-fudge brownie cupcakes with some toasted marshmallow frosting and red and silver sprinkles. Ah. So this is a new recipe. Add the salt. Now... be honest. - Always. - Mm-hmm. Well, it looks amazing. Mm... Oh, my gosh, Nina, this is incredible. I wanna include them in my next cookbook. - Mm-hmm. - And speaking of which... Hot off the presses. Oh, uh, wow! "For the sake of the bake." I love it. I think you might wanna see the dedication inside. My mom would have loved this. I hope so. You know, she was the best baker I ever met. I can't believe it's been two years. Hey. When are you going back home for Christmas? I mean, now I don't know. Okay, you know I take my role as your godmother seriously, right? I know. Why not take an extended break back home? Yeah, I mean, I suppose I could go help my dad with the bakery during the Christmas rush. What? Nothing. Yeah, I'm sure your dad would love that. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. I haven't been back since... Hey, I'll be there visiting Shelby. Mm. Oh, okay, I'm sorry, is that name still banned from being spoken? Ah, yes, and I will let you know when that embargo has lifted.

You didn't get it? Oh. Well, come in. Don't just stand there. And... Oh. We'll, uh, we'll talk all about it. You okay? Yeah, yeah. It's just, um... It's been a while. I know. Take your time. I'll make some coffee. - What is all that? - Huh? Oh, just some bookkeeping I'm doing for the bakery. And going through receipts. One thing I learned is I took one too many pedicures this year. Well, in fairness, I've seen your feet. I'd consider that money well spent. Yeah. So how is everything doing, dad, with the bakery? Oh, you know, not the same without your mother. But doing fine. - Dark roast okay? - Uh-huh. Yeah. Ah, let's chat, I have a few choice words I'd like to say about Bloom City Design. Actually, dad, could we take a raincheck? Being home is just a little overwhelming. Oh. I-I mean, uh, yeah. Sure. Maybe I could borrow the car, just drive around town a little. - Is that okay? - Well, of course, Hazelnut. Uh. - The starter is still finicky. - Okay. And the passenger window is still sticky. Okay. Anything else? Crack up the tunes, 'cause the stereo is still awesome! Okay. Thanks, dad.

Yeah. Uh, police have a warrant out for my arrest. All right, FBI's most wanted, I saw it on Date Nightlast night. Thought you'd be taller. I'm Hazel, of Hazelnut Bakery. I'm Ted's daughter. Oh. Sorry. Uh, I'm James, the new baker. - You're a baker? - Mm-hmm. I didn't realize that was such a dangerous line of work. Did you enjoy that scone you stole? Mm, didn't steal it, and if I'm being honest, your presentation could use a little work. - Wow. Notes already. Okay. - Hey. I just call it like I see it. But, yes, that was a very delicious scone. Oh. Why is it so slow right now? It's never this empty around Christmas. Might have something to do with the new bakery they opened up across the street. You saw the line, right? That line is for another bakery? - Yup. Butter Up Bakes. - Butter Up Bakes? Yeah. Oh. Excuse me, I've got something in the oven. Oh, sorry. W... Uh, where did you say that you baked before? Oh, I didn't. This is my first baking job. Your-your dad hired me on as a contractor to do the renovations. Renovations? What renovations? He didn't tell you? Oh! No, he most certainly did not! What is going on here? Perfection, that's what's going on. You should've heard when they were doing renos over at Butter Up Bakes. Every day banging those... - It was hell. - Okay, this is a disaster. That's why I'm fixing it, I mean, your dad had me in to fix one of the shelves, it turns out they were all about to collapse, and the pantry was busted. The stove needed new burner. So two months later, here I am, baking as well. I had no idea things were this serious. Everything is in disrepair, there's no foot traffic, thanks to the new bakery across the street. We're behind on... Hey, I'm-I'm part of the solution. Or I'm trying to be. No, o-of-of course, I'm sorry. It's just, this is bad. This is really, really bad. It's already hard enough just being back here. I've heard a lot about your mom. Sounded like she was an incredible woman. She really was. Now everything she's built is just falling apart. - Hi. - Hey. Hope you don't mind steaks for dinner. No. Wow, big guy's grilling. I didn't even know you could do that. Ah, I just wanna expand my repertoire from bacon and eggs. How was town? Oh, uh, actually, I went by the bakery. - Oh? - Also, I found this. Uh-oh. Dad, why didn't you tell me things were this bad? The last thing your mother would want is for you to put your dreams on hold and shoulder this. Plus, you had a new job and everything. I thought I could fix it. I mean, look, of the three cakes today, for me, visually, the cleanest cake was Joshua's. Judges, this is it. Bakers, you did not make it easy for the judges. But in the end, only one baker can win $50,000 and the title of Holiday Baking Champion. And that baker is... Jennifer! Congratulations! You are the Holiday Baking Champion! I'm the Holiday Baking Champion! - Dad! - Steaks are a little over-done. But with some steak sauce... I think I know how to save the bakery. Uh, don't you wanna eat first? Yes, yes, I'm starving. I'll tell you my idea. Are you guys serious, Ted? Dead serious. Hazel and I don't exactly know each other. And is either of us qualified to enter a national contest like that? - Mm... - I mean... I told you this was a bad idea. - I can do this alone, dad. - Now hang on. We all know how good James' baking is. - I had one scone. - You said it was delicious. And that scone was just the beginning. Oh. Well, at least he's humble. Aren't these contests super competitive? - Would we even get in? - Um, excuse me. My mother was a legend at the Christmas Bakeoff. She won four times. As soon as they hear her daughter wants to enter, they'll eat it up. At least she's humble. It's a $100,000, James. Half of that will save this bakery and your job. The other half could be a down payment on a house. Okay, hold on a second, before you go getting too excited, Julia Child, I'm the one who needs convincing here. Meaning? An audition. Okay. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Wha... - Oh. - Okay. All right, what we have here is a lemon-basil shortbread with a raspberry royal icing. - Interesting. - Questionable. I mean, especially 'cause it's a Christmas cookie. Well, I think they look great, James. - Thank you, Ted. - Okay. Well, moment of truth. Oh, wow. They're... - Wow, it's amazing! - Oh, great. Full disclosure, I make these a lot. They're my daughter's favorite. Oh, you have a daughter? I sure do. Claire. - She's incredible. - Mm. Well, as far as I'm concerned, you passed with flying colors. - Mm. - What do you think? Mm... James, welcome to the team. Oh. I'm... I don't know. I had to go through this whole song and dance to prove myself to you? I mean, what are you bringing to the table? Why should I do this with you? You know, maybe I should just join the competition alone. Wow. I didn't know you were such an opportunist. - Hazel has a lot to offer. - Thank you. Oh. Like? Well, I mean, you don't bake. You work an office job. - An office job as an architect. - So? She has a vision of how this gingerbread house should be. - Right? - Oh. Y-you have a vision? Well, not... not yet. But, would you... Hold on. I know how I want it to make me feel. Buildings aren't just glass and cement to me. They're art and craftsmanship. A good design takes a, a basic human need and turns it into a symbol of passion and ingenuity. And I know that might seem silly to think about these things with respect to a gingerbread house, but if I could just capture even a fraction of that in an edible version, then I feel like we would've achieved something. Yeah, yeah, let's do it. All right, you guys sure you don't need an extra hand here? I think we'll manage. You have more important things to do. - James, give me a ride home? - You bet, Teddy-bear. Okay. Um, I'm gonna come up with some designs tonight. Sounds good. I'm gonna fix that mis-matched tile as soon as I'm done with the rest of the renos. Oh, that's okay. I like it. See ya. ♪ This Christmas Nina? - Okay. - At dinner. I'm gonna hold you to that. Nina... What are you doing here? I'm about to buy a rhubarb tart. - Okay. - Oh, wait. All right. - This place is Shelby's? - Uh... Mm... W-why didn't you tell me that your niece owns this bakery? Now, I wanted to tell you, but your father swore me to secrecy. Yeah, he thought you might worry. And besides, you girls haven't really talked since high school, and I-I didn't wanna stick my nose into something that wasn't my business. - Wow. - Hazel? Hey, Shelby. Uh, it's been a while. Visiting for Christmas? Yeah, yeah. I, um, I didn't realize you still lived here. Just moved back. Actually, um, I was in Chicago for a bit. Had a little bakery out there, but rent was no joke. So after we got married, Rebecca and I decided to try out here. - Oh. - Uh, Rebecca, this is Hazel. Oh. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. Yeah, it's-it's great to meet you. I imagine this must be a surprise, considering all the boyfriends I burned through in high school. Well, one in particular comes to mind. Yeah, you know, I've, I've processed that. Well, that's-that's great. I'm just trying to process where all my mom's customers went. I didn't choose this spot to put the hurt on your mom's bakery, Hazel. You know I always loved that place. It's a funny way of showing it. Don't blame me if the bakery is struggling. Okay? Your presentation needs work, try switching things up with some new recipes once in a while. Wow, Shelby knows everything there is to know about everything, huh? I see not much has changed since high school. That was dramatic. Everything okay over there? I mean, y-yeah, fine. I'm just having a really hard time deciding on a design. Oh. Hm. Also, I, um, I stopped by Butter Up Bakes after I left this afternoon. Met the new owner. This calls for your mother's secret weapon whenever you were upset, a good-old banana split. You, um, you're upset I didn't tell you it's Shelby's place. You didn't just not tell me. You told Nina not to say anything. I mean, dad, between this and-and me finding out about the bakery not doing well, it feels like you're keeping secrets. And we don't do that in this family. Given your history with Shelby, I thought it was for the best. - Chocolate sauce? - I deserve to know these things. They affect me, too. And-and, yes, be generous. I'm sorry I didn't have a better excuse than I was trying to protect you, but it's the best I've got. - Whipped cream? - Obviously. We've had a rough couple of years. I didn't want to dump anything else on you. If you're still mad, I'm happy to eat this on my own. Oh, don't be ridiculous, dad. I'm not that mad. Your job is to find the cheesiest Christmas movie on TV. You got it. - Good morning. - Come right on in. - Hi. - Hi. Hazel, this is my daughter, Claire. Nice to meet you. Hey, thanks for helping your dad out. - He pays me in cookies. - Oh. A shrewd businesswoman. I like it. - She's cute. - Yeah, she sure is. Hope you don't mind her hanging around here. My mom wasn't able to babysit this morning. Oh, are you kidding? No problem. I pretty much grew up in this place. Yeah, comes with the territory of being a single dad. Watch out. Her mom lives in the city, but we split custody. Luckily, we're still good friends. Mm. Well, hey, listen, so I, um, I did some initial designs. They're still pretty rough, but I thought I could show you, and maybe that might spark some ideas. Okay. Okay, so, um, this first one's kind of this funky little house and it has a river. And I was thinking the river could be made of frosting? Mm-hmm. Okay, well, this next one is a castle and, um, it's got a moat around it, which I thought was pretty cool. Great. - You're not even looking. - I'm sorry. I don't know if you realize, but the bakery is open right now. Um, a bakery I'm actually running. Whoa! Oh! That is the best Danish I've ever had in my life. Okay, let me get this straight, so you have time to enjoy your Danishes and not look at my designs? Look, if we're gonna be teammates, we're gonna have to communicate. You can't just show up here unannounced and expect me to give you my undivided attention. I'm busy. Oh, yeah. - Let's see. - Okay. - So, um, yeah, it's... - Wow. That's amazing, actually. L-let me see the first one. So... Obviously, you're an artist. I could never do this. Thanks. I can do better. And, listen, I'm sorry, you're right. I-I shouldn't have just shown up here without checking with you first. Apology accepted. Okay. Oh. Hey. Uh, before you go, they're doing a little meet-and-greet thing for the contestants in Chicago tonight. Would you wanna come? I know you have Claire and all... - In. - As in... In, as in, yeah, I'm in. We're teammates. Let's do it. Oh, okay. Hey, is he always like this? - Pretty much. - Huh. - How's that cookie? - It's good. Good. Yeah. ♪ Let let let let's celebrate ♪ ♪ Christmas in the sun ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ Christmas in the sun ♪ Ooh ooh ooh Uh, sorry I'm late, my, um, babysitter took her sweet time coming over. - You mean your mom? - Yeah, I mean my mom. Come on, they've already started. Um... Fancy clothes, fancy hotel. We might as well make an entrance. And while it's humbling to be the host of the best turnout in Chicago Christmas Bakeoff history... Yes, you're my hero, Mark. I love you! That only means the competition this year is gonna be that much steeper. Now, you'll be judged in four categories. Overall appearance, creativity, difficulty, craftsmanship. - So don't hold back! - No... Now, I know everybody has a lot of hard work ahead of 'em, so let's have some fun. Enjoy yourselves, guys. Whoo! All right, where should we start? Should we do some recon or sow the seeds of sabotage? That's not a bad idea, uh, the recon part. - Sabotage is a terrible idea. - Come on. - Mark. - Hi. Oh, great. What? Do you see the woman in red over there? - Yeah. - That's Shelby. She and the woman next to her, Rebecca, own the bakery across the street. Well, well, well. Maybe some sabotage is in order. Can you please stop saying sabotage? - I can try. - I believe you know my aunt. - Nina Marsden? - Yes, of course! I've had the pleasure of baking beside her a few times. I'll tell you what, if that kind of talent runs in the family, I can't wait to see the gingerbread house you come up with. - Um, thank you. - Good luck. Ah, ah, ah... Shelby also happens to be my former best friend from high school, so that's a fun little twist. - Former? - It's complicated. Alan and Doug Jameson. Oh, probably already knew that. Oh, uh, I didn't know that. - Did you know that? - I'm not f-familiar. Well, anyway, nice to meet you. It will be nice when you're applauding our $100,000 win. Are you related to Judy Stanley? Yeah, yeah. I'm her daughter. I thought so. You look just like her. Your mom was an amazing baker. She was so nice to me when I was first starting out. I'm really glad to hear that. Thank you for telling me. It means a lot. Yeah, you should. Yeah. - What... - I-I don't know... They were certainly an interesting pair. - Uh-huh. - Right. - I'm Yasmin. - Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Hazel, and this is my partner, James. You two make a very lovely couple. - Oh! No, no, no, no. - No! Not, not, uh... She meant baking partner, for the competition. - Not, uh... - Oh. Yeah. Sorry. I didn't mean to assume. My family just moved here from Iran, and things still get lost in translation. Oh, no, no, honest mistake. Um, so how are you finding Chicago so far? - Um, very cold. - Yeah. But, uh, it's been really wonderful. We don't celebrate Christmas, but the lights and the decorations are so beautiful. Yeah. Do you have any design ideas yet? There's a beautiful mosque where we grew up that is very dear to us. Oh, that's a lovely idea. A gingerbread mosque? I love that. I can't imagine choosing something else. It's a place of joy and community and faith. From what I understand, that's what Christmas is all about. Um, how about you two? - Oh, uh, well... - Well... We are still working on that. Just pick a place close to your heart, and you can't go wrong. Good luck. She was sweet. What are you cooking up in there? I was just thinking about what Yasmin said. I think I have an idea for our design. Do you wanna come check it out? And leave me hangry here? I mean, sure, we could stay for the free appetizers, or we could go get a jump on the competition. - Okay, yeah. - Yes. So what do you think? You wanna make City Hall? Well, sure, to you it's just City Hall, but to me it's someplace special. My mom used to bring me here when I was growing up. It was designed by Eleanor Jenkins in 1897, one of the first recognized female architects. And just look at that clock tower. This building is the reason why I wanted to be an architect. So? Well, a good design takes a basic human need and turns it into a symbol of passion and ingenuity. I think it's perfect. Well, I still need to find a 3-D printer. You know, I spent all morning calling architecture firms around Chicago, I could not find one taker. You know, there's a small operation in Oak Park you could try. I think it's called Lightbox M-Moder-Moderno. - Lightbox Moderno. - Okay. Thanks. I'll try 'em. Did you, um, use the ground cloves? I thought we were supposed to be working on our recipe. Oh, and I have some designs I wanna show you. Look, I-I don't know how much I can work on the competition while also manning this bakery and taking care of Claire on my own. I totally respect that. And I've actually been thinking about this. We have a little over a week to go and so much to accomplish. I-I'm sorry to say, but I think we should close the bakery for now. You wanna close the bakery now? Dad, look around. All of our foot traffic is going to Shelby's bakery. It's costing us more to make things that nobody's buying. Look, I know it doesn't feel great to close the store, especially at Christmas. But this is Hail Mary time, okay? One week of meager sales is not gonna save the bakery. But if by closing it buys us time to focus on something that can, then I think we should. Hazelnut Bakery closed for the holidays. As much as it pains me to say it, you might as well. I think you're right. It'll be okay, dad. You'll see. I hope you're right. It was an interesting call to receive. I've never heard of anybody 3-D printing a model of a gingerbread house. Yeah, yeah. What can I say? It's a life-goal met. No, it's a, it's actually for a competition. Oh. Mm. Hey, these offices are pretty great. Thank you. How long have you guys been here? Actually, we just got up and running, and, you know, we're still pretty small, but hopefully, my ambition will soon outgrow the space. - I'm sure it will. - Oh, thanks. Uh, printer's right through there. - Right. - Just out of curiosity... Could I check out what you're making? - Yeah, sure. - Oh, wow. - City Hall. - Yeah. - I love this building. Huh. - Me, too. - Hm. - Designed by Eleanor Jenkins... In 1897. So I guess if I ever get a call from a client that's looking to build a house in the woods made of candy, you know, to capture children, I'm gonna know who to call. It's like fatten 'em up and eat 'em, right? - Whatever the client wants. Oh. - Exactly. Yeah, I'm sorry, that got weird. I'll-I'll-I'll... I'll go do my work now. Thank you so much for the 3-D printer. Mm, mm. Hey. Oh, wow! Is that the, uh... Well, that's amazing. Huh. I'm impressed. You're late. Yeah, I was, I just dropped off Claire at the pool and ended up shooting some hoops with some friends and lost track of time. You're late because you were shooting hoops? And lost track of time. Is that an apology? I... Yes. Where are you going? Field trip. You coming? Yeah, I guess so. This kitchen is so cozy. Yeah, make yourself at home. Chocolate syrup? No. No, that's gotta be wrong. That would make the dough wet. Well, not according to my mom. Look, she says don't add more than half a cup. Who does this woman think she is? Okay, well, on that note, field trip over. We just got here. Can't we have a cup of tea or something? Absolutely not. Come on. Whoa, who made you boss? Ah, you did, after you chose to shoot some three-pointers this morning. Oh, I-I didn't shoot any three-pointers this morning. Yeah, I did shoot some hook shots, though. Well, a hook shot. All right, take it easy, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. - Let's go. - I wish. We're gonna try my mom's recipe. ♪ Ah - Should I turn it off? - Yeah. - Are you ready for this? - Go for it. Okay. This is eating chocolate. A little bit of that cream. Wonderful. Not bad. It sticks together. Yeah, but is it edible? That's the question. - Moment of truth. - Here goes nothing. - Mm. Wow. That's really good. - Mm-hm-hm.. Yeah, your mom's recipe was spot-on. - Mm-hmm. - Glad I thought of using it. Hey, what do you say we go grab a hot-chocolate, do some people-watching? Yeah, that sounds really nice. Great. - Why are you staring at me? - I'm not staring at you. I'm just eating my gingerbread looking in your direction. That's staring. Oak Park is so beautiful at Christmas. What's it like being back? - It-it's nice. - Mm. - And hard. - Okay. The things I love the most all remind me of my mom. - Mm. - Sorry, sorry to be a downer. No, not at all. You-you wear your heart on your sleeve. - I really like it. - Oh. And how about you? Is Christmas hard without her? It's a little strange. But I'm very grateful to be spending it with Claire. Mm. How long were you two together? Or we could talk about something else, like, um... What do you think the Bears' post-season chances are? Oh, I-I only follow cricket. Yeah, really got into it with your dad. Oh. Um, I had no idea. - D-do you understand the game? - No, not a thing. I pretend really well. You know, we got together right after college. We were still figuring out who we were. And she's a great woman, but somewhere along the way we just grew apart. Mm, well, she probably couldn't handle the fact that you're a better baker. Yeah. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. No, we broke up a couple of years ago. I know two years sounds like a long time... No, it really doesn't. But for whatever reason, I haven't really wanted to put myself back out there yet. ♪ Joy to the world the Lord is come ♪ ♪ Let Earth receive her King ♪ Let every heart prepare Him room ♪ ♪ And heaven and nature sing and heaven and nature sing ♪ ♪ And heaven heaven and nature sing ♪ - Whoo! - Good! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - It's so cool! - Isn't it? Okay, architecture 101. This first part of the wall is called our cornerstone. And that sits on the foundation, which helps evenly distribute the weight. Mm. How long do we have to do this for? Um, only until tomorrow. I'm kidding, we just need to get these guys to stick together, so they can stand up straight. My dad said this was your mom's bakery? Yup, she opened it a few years after I was born. - And named it after me. - My mom lives in the city. Yeah, but you still see her a lot, though, right? Yeah, I split my time between the two. I love Chicago time with my mom. And then I come back to Oak Park to chill. Sounds like a pretty good setup. I have a great mom and dad, even if they're not together still. I feel lucky. Okay, that should do it. I think we can let go. That went well. I just don't understand what happened. I think, I think the sides aren't straight, so the edges aren't lining up. I don't know. Here, let me show you how a real baker does it. - Follow me in the kitchen. - This will be interesting. Watch and learn, ladies. Watch and learn. Ah. - Yeah, that didn't work. - No, it didn't. All right, I've gotta go to the store, grab some cardamom. We could go to the Christmas market. Yeah, they sell all kinds of stuff. No, um, I mean, if you want to. - In. Right, dad? - Ah. I've actually got a bunch of things that I have to... In. In. - I'm out of here. - Mm, all right. Well, there she goes. This orange roll is amazing. Oh, my gosh, it's so good. Mm, and this bourbon glaze could give our windows a really nice sheen. - Mm, I'm into it. - Okay. - Speaking of windows... - Mm-hmm? I did notice that a few of 'em at the bakery need repair. Could you fix those with your handy-dandy miter saw? Okay, look, you'd be surprised how much a well-wielded miter saw can actually fix. I'm the problem in that scenario. By the way, what's with that mismatched tile at the bakery? Oh, it's a long story, but my mom did always say that it reminded her that what's different about us is also what makes us special. - Hm. That's nice. - It's nice. Oh! Hey, Yasmin! Ah. Hazel! James! - Nice to see you. - You, too. Hey, how's the mosque coming along? Mostly good, but with a few setbacks. The qubba's trickier to build than I thought. If it makes you feel any better, we have had a few setbacks of our own. - Yeah. - Good. I don't want to suffer alone. Daddy, well, see this! I feel like Claire is about to guilt me into buying her something, I'll be right back. Let me go see what trouble I'm in. - He's cute. - Oh, no, uh, no. This is strictly professional. Yeah, I don't think he's really interested in seeing anyone right now, anyway. I-I mean, we aren't interested. Yeah. Plus, we live in different cities. Which is a moot point, because there's absolutely nothing going on between us. All I said was that he was cute. Yeah. Hey, I'll text you. Rebecca, I'm at the cutest park right now. They have absolutely everything. You would love it. Ah, let me call you back. Hazel. Shelby. I saw you at the MacKinley Hotel the other night. You didn't say hi. Oh, uh, yeah, that's 'cause you were too busy schmoozing with Mark Clemmons. You really know how to just get right in there, don't ya? I can't apologize for what I did in high school for the rest of my life, Hazel. You have to get over it. Well, maybe if you had apologized for real for once, I would. I have to get back to the bakery and help out Rebecca. - Right, the bakery. - Excuse me. - Good luck in the competition. - Thanks. You, too. Hey, um... That looks good. Thanks. I'm gettin' there. How you doing? Fine, I guess. Just ran into Shelby at the market. What's with you two? Seems like she gets under your skin. It's just stupid drama from high school that we never worked through. Mm. You wanna talk about it? Uh, yeah, okay, um... Well, we were best friends growing up. The best of friends. And then we sort of fell into different cliques when we got into high school. And then at prom, she, um, stole my date. - Brian Walker. Yeah. - No way. The boy I'd been in love with since fifth grade. - Sounds dreamy. - Oh, he was. - So dreamy. - That's rough. You never forget the day that your best friend stabs you in the back. I bet. Well... I have something that might make you feel a little bit better. Absolutely destroying Shelby in the competition? Yes. Also, come here. Okay. Ta-da! Now there's two mismatched tiles. One from your mom and one for you. Wow. It's really special. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Now, shall we get to that gingerbread? Let's. Here, look, it's perfect. Yeah. Better, better. - Mm, looks good. - Yeah, it's the bottom edge. Yeah, bottom edge, so let's mark it here. Oh, wow. - There you go. - Beautiful. Oh, wow. Oh, thank you. - Hold on, what's the joke? - Don't worry about it. Oh, yes. Great. ♪ Hey Gorgeous. - Easy. - Yup. I got it. Yes! Look at that! We did it. It looks amazing. Yeah, and thanks to James, not only is it sturdy... - It tastes delicious. - Do we get to eat it afterwards? - Mm-hmm. - Listen, seriously, Hazel. I've baked a few things in my life, nothing compares to this. - This is you. - Oh, come on, I mean... Without your help, it wouldn't taste half as good. It is your architectural skill that brought this to life. - There's no question. - Well, thank you. But I couldn't have done it without you. I'm only happy when you're in the room. Hey, what do you guys think about maybe doing a little more work on the clock tower? I'd really love it if the hands of the clock move somehow. - That'd be so cool! - I think so, too. - And probably impossible. - Oh, come on. I wouldn't touch it. It's perfect. Hazel... Okay, fine, we'll leave it alone. How about we get some hot chocolate to celebrate? - Yeah! - That's a great idea. Your mother would be so proud. Well, she was proud anyway, but seeing you bake like that... We can't lose this place, dad. - Hello? - Hazel, it's Daryl Baxter. Oh, uh, hi, sir, I-I'm sorry, you just caught me off-guard there for a second. I'll bet you're wondering why I'm calling you, and, uh, so close to Christmas, no less. Uh, yeah, I'd be lying if I said no. Well, let me cut to the chase. I wanna be this kind of dude who owns up to his mistakes. And, uh, well, I made a big one. I had two consultants to choose from, and I chose wrong. - You did? - Ah. Ben-uh-jamin didn't quite work out. Dropped the ball with one of our biggest clients and cost us the account. Needless to say, his position has opened up. How would you like to start as a full-time architect at Bloom in the new year? Did I lose you? Uh, n-n-no. So-sorry, I'm here. I... You want me to work at Bloom? Yuppers. Wow. I... I don't really know what to say. It's always been my dream to work there. So is that a yupper? Um, I am, of course, overjoyed at the offer. It's just, it's just a lot to take in right now. I can appreciate that. Um, probably not the call you were expecting. Do you wanna sleep on it? I thought I didn't work well with others. Did I say that? You did. Yeah. Hazel, you're who we want. But we need to fill this position, so we can't hang around forever. I understand, and I promise to let you know in a couple of days. I just have something back home that I need to finish. Make sure I leave things in good hands. All right. All right, I guess. Um, give me a call when you've decided. And, um, look forward to hearing from you. I will. A-and thank you, sir. Hi. I thought we agreed you were gonna leave it. Um, yeah, uh, there's been a slight change of plans. I spent all day trying to figure out how to make the clock move. Now, I know we can't make it actually function, but if I could just get the hands to spin, that's... Hey, did-did something happen since I last saw you? - Y-y-you seem a little... - Stressed? Uh, yeah, I was gonna say manic. Huh. Okay, look, I have a life to get back to in New York. The job of my dreams is waiting for me. And I can't go anywhere until I am sure the bakery is safe. My mother's legacy is at stake here. Do you understand that? - Yeah. - Great. But, um, we're also a team, and that means communicating things to each other. Hey, at the end of the day, if it doesn't work out, it's just a contest. - "It's just a contest?" - Mm-hmm. Well, clearly, this is far more important to me than it is to you, and I really wish I had known that... - Hazel! - No, just... No, no, no, no, no. Oh... - Oh, my God. - Um, we'll fix it. What do you mean fix it? It's ruined! It took us a week to build this, and-and now the contest is tomorrow, there is no fix it! - Just let me help you... - No, you wanna help? Just leave. - What? - Please, just-just go. Oh... No... Mind if I come in? Enter at your own risk. James filled me in. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. Yeah, me too. Now because of me, the bakery is gonna close. Don't you think that for one second. It's my fault the bakery's on its last legs. I'm the one who let it start slipping. I'm the one who didn't ask for help. Hey, dad, come on. - You were grieving. - Well... Don't be so hard on yourself. And at least you were here, doing your best. Where was I? I was across the country, just letting you carry all of this? But you're here now. Right. It's just a store. We'll always have our memories. Do you remember when, um, you and mom would dance to Motown after you closed up the shop? Yeah, you-you guys thought I was sleeping in the back, but I would, uh, I would watch you. - You did? - Yeah. Well... I'm just scared that if we lose the bakery, that last little piece of mom I have still standing is just gonna disappear. Hazel, don't you worry about your mom disappearing. She's gonna be with us for the rest of our lives, bakery or not, hm. Yeah. Oh. - I love you, dad. - I love you, too. And you didn't even get a photo of your City Hall? Uh, no. You always take a photo when you make something pretty. Hey. Come on. As your mom would always say, "There's no problem too big that can't be solved with cake." Mm. This is so delicious. Is this a new recipe? She made this? If by she you mean Shelby, then, yes. I cannot believe that you tricked me into eating something from Hazelnut's biggest competitor! Look, if you girls can't eat each other's baking, then I feel sorry for the both of you. Hey, fair. So, uh, you sure there's nothing to be done about that clock tower inside there? - It's in pieces. - Mm. And I'd have to do it by myself. James, uh... Well, let's just say we're not exactly on speaking terms right now. You know, if you really did need help, we both know someone who's available. I don't understand what this has to do with me. Don't look at me, this was your aunt's idea. Okay, listen, I figured, since you and Rebecca had already finished, that maybe you could help Hazel salvage hers. Why would I help her? My biggest competition dropping out only helps us. All right, competition is a good thing. It keeps you on your toes. Besides, Oak Park is big enough for two bakeries. Nina, I know your heart is in the right place, but clearly, this is not the answer. Well, sure it is, if you just stop being a couple of pinheads. - Oh, I'm not being... - Okay, come on, you girls. Come on. You were best friends. And that is a luxury because, as we all know, my best friend is no longer with us. If that's not good enough a reason, then how about this? I helped you and Rebecca open up that bakery and I didn't ask for a dime in return. So guess what? Now I have a cost, and this is my fee. Fine, but I'm doing it for you. - Not her. - Mm-hmm, okay. Now, the contest is tomorrow, so you girls have all night to work. Hazel... You have never been a quitter, so don't start now. The sooner we start, the sooner this can be over. Let's go. This is the recipe you're using? Yeah, yeah, my partner... Well, my ex-partner, James, came up with it. It's a variation of my mom's recipe. - James knows what he's doing. - Yeah. Yeah, he does. So are you gonna start helping, or... Yeah. You know, despite what you may think, I have no desire to see this bakery closed. - Mm. - I'm serious. T-this place is an institution. I used to love hanging out here with your mom. Yeah, those are some of my favorite memories, too. Hey, hey, careful. Look, we might as well at least try to talk about what happened. So, where do we start? I just don't understand why. We used to be best friends, and then... It wasn't malicious, Hazel. We just started hanging out with different people. You had your own friend group that I wasn't a part of. Yeah, they used to be your friend group. People change. It was high school. Yeah, fine. But it's like I didn't even exist to you anymore. I had my own secret about who I was, and hanging with the popular kids seemed like the best way to hide it. Okay, fair enough. But what about prom? I mean, you stole my date. Here's what happened. Okay. So I'm at prom, and Brian Walker asked me to dance with him. - He's the hottest guy at school. - Oh, I remember. - Yeah. The beaver swoop. Yeah. - The beaver swoop. Um, so everyone's looking at me, and it felt weird if I said no because I wanted everyone to think I was straight. Honestly, I had eyes for Kim Wescott the whole night. She was killing it in that strapless dress. Oh, she was, wasn't she? Man, that collar bone, right? Right. Brian Walker really didn't have much going for him aside from those dreamy good looks, did he? Well, he did ditch the coolest girl in school on prom night. So, yeah. I'd have to agree with you. But it wasn't right for me to dance with him. And I'm sorry. - Well, look at that. - Hm? Do you remember how Mr. Scarderi would freak out over our overdue library books? Yes, and then after he cooled down, he'd be like... "Hey, girls, you reading anything stimulating?" Oh... We shouldn't have waited this long to talk. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. I forgot how fun it was just hanging out. Mm. I really am sorry, though, about everything. I should've called you after your mom passed. I wanted to, but it had been so long. And-and I know that's not an excuse. I-I can't make that up to you. You're here now. You know, I have to say, under the circumstances... it came out okay. Yeah, I just wish we had more time. We could've really crushed it. - We did the best we could. - Yeah. I might add some more Christmas decorations. - Just these. - Pick one. Hey, it's James. Please leave a message. Hi. Hi, James, it's, uh, it's me. Um... I just wanted to say I'm, I'm really sorry. I'd really love to see you at the competition today. You're not gonna believe what happened, and I am dying to show you. Also, I just really wanna talk. Anyway, um, I hope you'll think about coming. It won't be the same without you. Okay. Bye. ♪ Ba-ra-da da-ra da-da dub-da Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Hey, hey, hey. - You ready? I think I'm more scared to drive than the first day your mom and I brought you home from the hospital. Okay, in that case, keys. Now, let's go win this competition. ♪ Ba-ra-da da-ra da-da dub-da You know, we would've been here sooner if you drove the speed limit. Dad, precious cargo, you think I'm gonna speed with this thing in the car? And that service elevator? I've had less turbulence at 30,000 feet. - Seriously. - Oh, that's a nice one. - Yeah, that's not bad. - Oh! Mm. Dad, I love you, but if you do that again, I will be making you a gingerbread coffin. Sorry. Easy. ♪ Ba-ra-da da-ra da-da dub-da - Watch out, dad, watch out. - Huh? What? Oh! - Guys, that looks great! - Hey-hey! Hi. Thank you. Hi! Can I have your name, please? Uh, yeah, it's Hazel Stanley. Okay, Stanley. You are table 1003, in the front. And I'd hurry, Mark's getting ready to start soon. - Okay, thanks. - Uh-oh. Let's go. - Right here, right here. - People. ♪ Ba-ra-da da-ra da-da dub-da Take it easy. - Yup. - Yup, yup, yup. - That's it. - Oh. I can't believe that went... Hi. Looks like you patched things up? I think so. It's a start, anyway. - Hm. Ready? - Yeah. - One, two, three. - Ai. - Ha. - Air-five, dad. Air-five. - Hey, proud of you, kid. - Thanks. See you. Hazel. Oh, Yasmin! - Hi. - Hi. Here. For good luck. It's one of my favorite sweets back home. Koloocheh. I made some for everyone. Oh, that's so nice. Oh, wow, that's really, really good. I hope Mark feels the same. Most of the mosque is made of it. Oh, Yasmin, it's incredible! Thank you. I can't believe I finished it on time. - Yours is beautiful as well. - Aw, thanks. I honestly can't believe we pulled it off. You and James must be proud. Uh, where is he? Yeah, I-I'm not even sure if he's gonna make it, actually. Oh, no, that's too bad. What's the matter, John and Paul? Couldn't keep the band together? - Something like that, yeah. - Ah. Have you seen our masterpiece? Yeah? - Oh, it's... - Exactly. It's supposed to render one speechless. - The clock, mm. - Doug. May I have your attention, please? It is my distinct pleasure to welcome you all to the 25th Annual Christmas Bakeoff! Wow, I see a lot of incredible teams here today. Now, just a reminder, we'll have the finalists in each category, overall appearance, difficulty, creativity and craftsmanship. And then we will announce our grand-prize winner. We're about to start the judging soon, if you could, please vacate the room, thank you very much. You fixed the clock. Yeah, yeah, I had a little help. - It looks great. - Thanks. I'm really glad you came. We made this together. James, I'm really, really sorry. The other day I took my own stuff out on you, and it wasn't right. Don't worry about it. So, are we okay? I put myself out there, um... - And that was scary for me. - I know. But I-I realize that I actually am ready for a partner. Me, too. But not someone who pushes me away when things get rough. I think we made something really beautiful here together. Thanks for that. The results are in! Please make your way back to your tables. Wow, well, this was one of the most difficult decisions in my entire career, and if you've ever seen Cookie Wars, you know that's saying something. Okay, after careful consideration, here are the finalists. For overall appearance, it's For The Birds! Yes, I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! For difficulty, the Cinnamosque! For creativity, the Ginger Lime-brary! - No. No. - Yes. Yes, yes, yes! Ah... Just one more spot, folks. In the category of craftsmanship, the winner is Christmas At City Hall! Now, for those of you who may not be aware, Hazel's mom, Judy, was a legend here at Christmas Bakeoff. She won four times. Now, before I announce the grand-prize winner, would anyone like to say anything about their experience? Um, I'd like to say something. Wonderful! Oh. Um, hi, everyone. I'm, I'm Hazel. This piece is a tribute to my mom, Judy Stanley. She was an incredible baker and a wonderful mom. And she taught me that with the right combination of ingredients, you can create anything. But somewhere along the way, I forgot that, and I thought I could do everything on my own. And in the process, I made people feel like they were less special to me than they really are. And, um... I'm not gonna do that anymore. Thank you. Okay, the moment we've all been waiting for. The grand-prize winner of the 25th Annual Christmas Bakeoff and recipient of $100,000 is... Yasmin Guhl for her creation, the Cinnamosque! - Thank you. - Whoa! Sorry we don't have better news to send you back home with. I'm not going back to New York. What do, what do you mean? What about your dream job? I think I can realize my dream here. This is where I wanna be. And I'm not trying to put any pressure on you or be presumptuous. I know I have some things to work on. And you have Claire and the bakery, and you probably need time... I don't need time. I'm gonna go see Claire. - I just.. - Gosh, ladies, it's incredible! - Do you like it? Thank you. - Wow. You all should be really proud. That was not easy. - Thank you. - Thanks. You know, Shelby, I was talking to your Aunt Nina, and she was telling me about your store. And yours, too, Hazel. So Yasmin's gonna be on my show in a few days, and I feel like you guys should join her. You know, two rival bakeries across the street from each other. One's doing traditional confections, the other one's kind of baking with the trends. I feel like it's a pretty cool story. I'd... We'd be open to that. You know what? Me, too. Awesome. Well, listen, I'll have my people reach out. But seriously, amazing job today. - Thank you so much. Thanks. - Congratulations. I guess the rivalry is back on. - Bring it. - Mm. ♪ It's Christmas time again ♪ And as always it feels the same ♪ Hey, guys. Tough break on the contest. I know you poured your heart into it. - It's okay. - You know... I have a proposition for you. Nina, I appreciate it, but I am not taking your money. Listen, I was talking with my publisher today and I mentioned this idea for a new cookbook, featuring the recipes from a star baker by the name of Judy Stanley. Now, I figured, maybe her daughter and her baking partner could write it together, seeing how they're semifinalists in a national competition. - Mm, wow, uh... - Oh! That's not it. I also negotiated a really nice advance. - What? Okay. - If you're interested. I just figured it could help the bakery stay afloat until the new customers start comin' in, which I suspect will be very soon. Nina. Nina, Nina, Nina. Wow. So, what do you say? I say you have yourself a deal. Ah. That's what I like to hear. Architects don't usually turn down companies like Bloom. Why did you turn them down, if you don't mind me asking? - They can't give me what I want. - Which is? To be here with the people who are important to me. And besides, they already made it very clear before that I am not the right fit. And you know what? They're right. I belong at an innovative woman-led company. You know, I wouldn't be able to match what Bloom's offering. That's okay. All right. Welcome aboard. Let's build something beautiful together. Let's. ♪ Under the Happy New Year. Cake pops.
