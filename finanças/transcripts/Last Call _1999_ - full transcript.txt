We’ll do that later. Jimmy hurt his knee in the fort. - I’m going to get him a Band-Aid. - Oh, thank you, Sister Jean. Hello, Sister Mary. Sorry to bother you again. Sister Mary: I got some money for the payment, and I’ll be in with it tomorrow morning. It’s already been paid off. What’re you talking about? Oh, the two young men that used to live here came in. Their names were Frank and Jonas. Jonas: Hey, Frank, I think I’ve figured out why the whole OJ thing happened. Frank: What the fuck are you talking about? Jonas: Mickey D’s did it. They backed the whole thing. You know what kinda publicity they got out of having OJ admit he slammed back a burger just before he killed his wife and her lover? They made the payment for me? No, no, no. They paid the whole loan off. But I’ll still need you to come in tomorrow to sign off on it. Yeah, alright. Uh... Jonas: Remember how they screwed everyone over when they came out with their pizza? All those ads? "It’s coming!" Half the fucking country was watching TV that day just to see what it was. It turned out to be pizza, Frank. They totally made fun of the situation. Frank: Spending a lot of money on TV commercials, and using a murder as a marketing device are two totally different things, alright? Jonas: I-- I know they are! Check out this theory. Let’s say OJ, being a superstar athlete, and doing endorsements, must’ve gotten to know some big execs at Mickey D’s. - Pretty good? - Frank: So what? Jonas: So maybe he’s buddies with the guys at Mickey D’s and tells ’em about his marital problems. They come up with the idea of murder. Frank: You’ve lost your fucking mind. I don’t get it. What was left on the loan? Just shy of $10,000. These boys must really like you. Jonas: So Mickey D’s spends $50 mill! And gets $200 mill with their promo. That’s fuckin' power! Frank: You’re really fucked. Okay, okay, look. This is the place, alright. You got your toy gun? Jonas: Yeah, hold on. Ah, shit! Frank: Stop fucking around! Jonas: Alright, I’m sorry. It was an accident. Frank: Alright, look. We’re in, we're out. It’s over. Let’s go. Hey, can I get change for a dollar, please? You guys are driving me crazy. You come in here, don’t buy anything. Yes, I give you change for a dollar. - Give me the money! - Ah! No! Please don’t shoot me! - The money! - No! No! Please! [crying, babbling] Please don’t hurt me! I have family! Here! You take the money! No! Go away! Just go away! Oh! [shrieking] Go away! Go away! [crying, blubbering] There was only $350 there. That’s not very much! No. Or maybe we went too early in the day. You know, there’s probably a lot more cash at the end of the fucking day. I don’t know, Frank, man. I’m feeling guilty. Yeah. That guy was pretty scared. It’s like he was traumatized, you know? I’m really sorry for that guy, man. No, forget that. You know, we didn’t ruin that guy’s life. It’s just half a day's business for him, man. He’ll recover. You know, it’s not our fault the fucking guy’s neurotic. Yeah, that’s true. Worry about us, you know? We still don’t have the money to pay back Fellini. I mean, we could roll 20 stores just like that, and still have nothing. Yeah. No, we gotta find a place with way more cash. Like a bank, man. No. Banks are way too risky, man. We gotta find something that’s... like, less conventional. Like-- like a restaurant, or-- or a bar. Nightclub. Like-- like something like that. Well, we gotta find the right place now. Yeah.

You notice anything strange about that car? What? [indistinct police radio chatter] The license stickers have expired. Oh. You know you gotta start paying attention to what’s going on.

At least call it in. This is PC 3-3-3-8. This cop must’ve followed me on the road. Saw my sticker on my license plate and thought it was expired. Anyway, I come out of the supermarket... this guy’s leaning on my car. Leaning on my car! Hey, pal, come here. I want to speak to you for a second. So I ignore him, right? I’m thinking... It’s late at night. Dangerous neighborhood. Turns out the guy’s an undercover cop. Hey, jack-off! I said I wanted to speak to you. Officer down! Officer down! Well, what’d you do?

He never told me he was a cop. - Shut up! - He never said nothing. [screams] Easy with the cuffs! - They’re kinda tight. - Shut up! Stupid ass doesn’t even identify himself as a cop. He says to me, "Hey, pal. I wanna talk to you a minute." They still threw me in a cruiser for three fucking hours with these cuffs on that’re super tight. [laughing] Stupid fucking cop.

Press the silent alarm. - I think we’re being robbed right now. - Where? - Woman: Forget it! - Woman 2: Oh my god. - What do you guys want? - Don’t get fucking stupid with me, man. You know what the fuck I want. Get over there. Let’s go! Over to the couch. - Watch him, Jonas. - Let’s go! If you go for a fucking gun in that desk, I’ll blow your fucking head off. - I-- I don’t have a gun. We want to cooperate. - Go! Alright, you guys got a garbage bag or something I can use? - A bag! I need a fucking bag. - No, no. We threw them out. It clutters the office. Fucking great. Watch him, Jonas! I got him. I got him. [phone rings] - Who the fuck’s gonna answer that? - Someone out there will get it. It’s probably someone's boyfriend or girlfriend. All right. - Leave it alone! - Okay. 128! Alright. Where’s the rest of the money? Do you know who owns this place? Ask me if I give a fuck. My dad does, and you guys just fucked up big time. Yeah. My dad’s bigger than your dad. Marie, keep quiet, okay? Alright, for the last time, where’s the fucking money? - It’s in there! - Get it! Come on. Let’s go. Open it. Get out of here. Fuckin’ sit down. Watch him, Jonas. What are we gonna do? Just wait for the cops, I guess. I don’t know. Frank: Watch ’em, Jonas. Watch ’em good. I think we should let everyone know what’s going on. I don’t know. I can’t think straight. I think we should just wait and let the cops handle this. [tires screeching] Hey, is there any more money? No, that’s everything. - You sure? - Yeah, that’s it. - Holy fuck. - What? Fuckin’ cops all over the place out there, man. Oh, shit. What are we gonna do, Frank? We’re gonna fuckin' stay cool. That’s what we're gonna do. Alright. Okay. Alright, let’s go. We’re going to the back. - Okay, let’s go. - We’re gonna take 'em to the back. Let’s go. Let’s go! Come on! Stop. Anybody in here? Alright. Let’s go! - What’re you doing? - We’re robbing the place, that’s what. - It’s your funeral, man. - What the fuck did you say to me? - Don’t shoot me. - If you don’t hurry up, I will. Come on, let’s fucking go. Let’s fucking go! I-- I can’t piss. Come on. Alright, everybody, this is a robbery. Everybody stay calm and cooperate, and nothing’s gonna happen to ya. You get out of line, you’re gonna get shot either by me or my mad-dog killer friend here. Alright, I want everyone down by the bar here. Come on! Now fuckin’ move! Alright. We’re gonna march over to these couches, alright? Let’s go, come on! Let’s go! Fuckin' move! Come on. I’m not fuckin' around here. Let’s go. Come on. Sit down. Bring those stools over. Come on. Alright. This is the situation. Alright, there’s cops all over the fuckin’ place outside. So you guys are now my hostages, alright? Hopefully this problem’s gonna get resolved sooner than later. Now, I don’t know how the cops found out about us, or how they know we’re here, but we are gonna find out. And when we do, the guilty party’s gonna suffer huge fuckin’ consequences. Alright, Jonas, take this kid up front. Get him to close the front blinds, and the curtain at the front. - Why me? - Cause I fuckin’ said so. Now, fuckin’ move! Go! Hey, make sure he’s in front of you. Just in case they try to shoot, they’ll get him instead of you. Alright. Let me say this fucking once. Anyone steps out of line, they’re gonna get fuckin' shot. Alright? [whispers] Fuck. Don’t shoot. We don't know who’s closing those blinds. [phone rings] If it’s somebody's friend, tell ’em they left. - [phone rings] - Go ahead. 128, how can I help you? This is Lieutenant Brass. Who am I speaking to? Uh, I’m one of the waitresses here. I work here. Brass: Is everyone all right in there? Yes, everybody’s fine. A little bit frightened, but that’s about all. Okay. We’re gonna try and alleviate the problem as soon as possible. Can I speak to one of the gunmen please? Sure. [whispers]: It’s the cops from outside. They want to speak to one of you. [whispers]: Thanks. [normal voice]: Yeah? This is Lieutenant Brass. Who am I speaking to? You can call me Snake. Okay, Snake. Listen. I want to solve this problem as cleanly and simply as possible. If you guys give yourselves up now, we’ll take it easy on you. [sighs] Listen here, Brass. I’m gonna shoot one person while I got you on the phone. And every half hour you keep me in here, I’m gonna shoot someone else. Listen up, Brass. - Holy shit! - [gunshot] Got the message now, pig? Time’s not on your side. He’s bluffing. You guys-- you guys don’t have anything to worry about, okay, if you all cooperate. We need each other, alright, to get out of here, so, just be cool. Right? Everybody’s cool. Everything’ll be fine. - Okay? What are we gonna do? - Look, I’m sorry, everybody. I’m sorry. I don’t know what the fuck we’re gonna do, man. I don’t know. Alright. Let’s just chill out. Let’s just fuckin' chill out for a minute here. What’s our plan, Lieutenant Brass? Go change your fuckin’ diaper and let me think. [mouths] [dialing] [line ringing] [phone ringing] Fellini. Mr. Fellini, Lieutenant Brass here. We got ourselves a problem. Someone’s trying to rob your Club 128. What exactly do you mean by "trying"? Well, they’re actually in the club right now... and it’s turned into a hostage situation. Is my daughter in there? I don’t know. They weren’t cooperating on the phone. I don’t even know how many guns there are. That’s why I'm calling you. Get somebody to call there, get your daughter on the phone, get some of these questions answered. I’ll see what I can find out. Brascoe: Michael, what is it? [phone rings] Hey, come here. Here. Take that. 128, can I help you? Okay. Hang on a second. It’s Marie's father on the phone. He’d like to speak with her. Okay, go tell her. Put the phone down, go tell her. Stay in your seat, alright? It’s your dad. - Make it snappy, alright? - No problem. Hello, Dad? Are you all right, princess? Yes, we’re all fine. Fellini: How many guys are in there with you? Marie: Uh, there’s two. - Do they both have guns? - Yes. How many hostages are there? Uh, there’s about 12 or so all together. Hey, let’s go. Come on. Don’t be scared, baby. I’m gonna get you outta there. I love you. Yeah, I’m not worried, Dad. I love you, too. Let me talk to one of the scumbags. - Hello? - I don’t know who you are, but all I can tell you is you are incredibly fucking stupid. You are also a walking fucking dead man. Oh, yeah? Who the fuck is this? My name is Michael Fellini. Just in case you don’t know, let me explain. I own this fuckin’ town! That girl I spoke to is my daughter. If you harm one hair on her head, I’ll kill your whole fucking family and everybody you know. Understand? You just give yourselves up. Because that’s your safest option at this point. God forbid, I get you first. You give yourselves up, and I’ll let the cops handle it. You take my money, you fuck with my family, and you’ll be paying long after you’re dead, which will be today. Understand? Alright. Just-- just go sit down. Do you know who owns this place, Jonas? Jonas: No, who? Fellini, that’s who. We’re fuckin' dead. What are we gonna do? I’ve had a feeling about this. These guys don’t know what the hell they’re doing. - [scoffs] Marie! - No, I’m serious. There’s something really weird going on about this. You know, at this particular moment, I don’t know what we’re gonna do. When he finds out it’s us, we’re worse than dead, man. - Um? - What? Look, we all know what’s going on, and we know who that was on the phone, and, uh, I was just wondering, do you guys want a drink or something? - Scotch. - Scotch. Oh, man. I can’t think right now. Look, I-- you know, I need some time alone, alright? I’m just gonna go use the can. Keep a close eye on everyone. Yeah, sure, Frank. Don’t worry about it. I’ll-- I'll watch them all. Thanks. I’ll be back. I'll be back. You okay, Frank? [phone rings] Lieutenant Brass, here. They got 12 hostages in there, and they got two guys with guns. One of the hostages is my daughter. What are you gonna do about it? Brass: 99% of hostage situations result in surrender. The best way to encourage surrender is to offer no way out. We’re calling in the SWAT team. Don’t bother, you fucking moron. Keep this low profile. You got two hours to get my daughter safely out of there. Otherwise, you’re off my payroll and in a lot of pain. Are you threatening an officer of the law? No. I’m not threatening an officer of the law. I’m promising a fucking asshole. Brass: Mr. Fellini... - Lieutenant. - Fuck off! [breathing heavily] [whimpering] [distorted] Jake, Jake. Jake! [sobbing] What am I gonna do, Jake? Well, what’s the story, morning glory? This is Fellini’s place. Holy shit. That bitch has his hand in everything. He owns this whole town, right? Okay, Francis. We got to look at this problem in a systematic way. What are your options? One thingy-dingy, you can use that little Italian girl out there to get away, right? Yeah. Yeah, we could get away temporarily. That wouldn’t be too difficult. But? But Fellini, he’d get us. Sooner than later. Ooh. That doesn’t sound too attractive. No. We could surrender. Fellini’s got a lot of contacts in the joint. He’d get us there too. Well, looks like you picked the wrong guy to rob, Frankie. So you got to face reality. You’re already dead, so there’s nothing to fear. - Am I losing my hair? - What do you mean? I mean, it’s not supposed to be like this. No, about this! I mean, what do you mean about this? Oh, I mean, if you go out in a blaze of glory with headlines and everything, you’ll help the cause. You won’t die in vain. I don’t know if I want to die, Jake. Francis, I love you, but you’re going down. There’s no way out. Not this time. I’m afraid, man. But, Francis, you’ll be with me all the time. It’ll be great. And I think you know, there are worthier lives than yours. Oh, shit. I gotta go. Manicure. He’s a dish. [wings flapping] No, Jake! Wait! Wait a minute! Jake. Jake! - [pounding] - [fire crackling] What? - Who’s Jake? - That’s his dead brother. What? Well... seeing that we’re gonna be here for a while and, well, you know that none of us are gonna fuck with you... maybe you wouldn’t mind if we went over and shot some pool or something? Sure. Just don’t fuck around, okay? No, we won’t. Who wants to play? Sure, I’ll play. - You playing? - Woman: Okay. Bouncer: Okay. We’re gonna need one more person if we play doubles. Alright. - You in? - No, I’m gonna stay here. Well, I’ll play if nobody else wants to. Alright, let’s go. Yes? You’re Jonas, right? That’s Frank? - Yeah. - The fuck are those people doing over there? - Oh! [laughing] - Playing pool. Yeah, I can see that. Why? Nah, fuck it. Guys, can I go to the bathroom? I really have to go bad. You take her, Jonas. Make sure you go in there with her, okay? - Leave your purse here. - I just have to get my lipstick. Frank: Okay. I thought you said you had to go to the washroom. No, I don’t have to go anymore. You know, you don’t look like a tough, scary guy at all. - Oh, no? - No, you look really sweet. [sighs] What are you looking at? Nothing. You see my panty lines? Can you see them now? You know what, you can have ’em if you want. [moaning] - I’m serious right now, babe. - Oh, you’re su-- sure? No. We gotta stop this. Are you sure? Yeah. [laughs] Yes. Yeah. Now. Get back out there now. Well, okay, lookit. Take these... give ’em back to me later. Okay? Okay. [coughs, clears throat] Oh my God. [sighs deeply] Holy fuck. 5:00 a.m. [clears throat] You got lipstick on your face. [laughing] Those are underwear. Holy fuck. Put-- hey! Put-- it’s underwear, man. Put the fuckin’ underwear away. Jesus Christ. You know things aren’t looking too good right now. Now, the cops-- we’re surrounded by cops. Fellini’s gonna kill us, whether we get out of here or not. And so far our only plan is that we have no plan. So can you do me a favor? Can you focus on what the fuck we’re trying to do here? [phone rings] Should I get that for you, Frank? No, it’s okay. It's probably just repeats by now anyway. Yeah? Yeah, this is Mr. Fellini. Can I please speak to the individual that decided to rob me? This is he. Fellini: Why are you still there? Frank: Well, where the fuck am I supposed to be? Sittin’ like a duck waiting for you to do whatever the fuck it is you’re gonna do to me? I want my daughter out of there safely immediately! Don’t start bossing me around, asshole. I don’t work for you. Now, if you don’t start acting reasonable, I’ll just fucking kill her right now. You know what I mean? Gonna be nice, huh? Say, "Yes, sir," or she’s fuckin' dead. Yes... sir. Good, little asshole. Now, I think we both know she’s the only real pawn left here in this game. So you gotta ask yourself this important question: How the fuck are you gonna get her back? Huh? I’ll tell you how. By making sure I’m either safe... or dead. What’s he saying? Why does it have to be either black or white? I think you know you made a mistake. You robbed the wrong place. Why don’t you let me help you? Maybe I can come there and help you get out of there safely. Why don’t you stop pretending we’re friends? Alright, I know how you guys operate. I saw The Godfather. I know you got connections all over the world and you won’t stop till you get us. So in the meantime, Fellini, I haven’t decided what I’m gonna do yet. - Bye. - [dial tone] He hung up on me. That fuckin’ little prick hung up on me. If he sticks his head out of that fucking building, you blow it the fuck off! I want that guy fucking dead right away! Michael, there are fucking cops all over the fucking place. I don’t give a fuck about the cops! - I want him fucking dead! - Brascoe: Alright, alright. I’ll take care of it. Your dad says hi. Cop: Did you hear about Barney? No, what about him? He banged that new parking chick. - What? The one with the ass? - Indiscriminate. What a dog. Fuck. We’re always pulling this fucking shit. Yeah, it’s cold, but what can you do, man? It’s a paycheck. Sarge ain’t looking over our shoulder. It’s not bad. It’s cold. [no distinct dialog] Jonas... [yawns] Thanks, man. So? What-- what are we gonna do, Frank? I’ll tell you in a minute. Alright, everybody come on over. I wanna-- I wanna talk to all of you guys. Hey, wake up. Come on. [claps] - So what are we gonna do, Frank? - I’ll tell you in a minute. Hey, grab a beer. Help yourselves, everybody. This is for you guys. So, what are you gonna do? Surrender? Yeah. Yeah, I am. What?! What are you talking about, Frank? You can’t do that! You said it yourself. We’re as good as dead if we go out there. We are as good as dead, Jonas. In the meantime, I’m gonna go surrender. You’re gonna get away with the money. How are we gonna do that? With the help of these people right here. - What?! - Hear me out. Alright, we know we fucked up by stealing from Fellini. We didn’t know this was his place. As a matter of fact, we were robbing this place to pay him back money we borrowed off him. We needed the money... for this foster home that we grew up in. The home had some debts and ran the risk of being shut down. There’s a woman there. There’s a woman there that put her life on the line for us. She raised us. And I want this money to go to her. I want Jonas to get away long enough... to get the money to her. Frank, can I talk to you in private? Yeah. Sure. I’ll be right back. I had no idea you knew my father. Well, I wouldn’t exactly say we’re friends. As a matter of fact, I think he wants to kill me. I could talk to him about this. I think he would understand you made a mistake. I don’t know. I don’t think in this case. He-- he can’t lose face like that. Well, it can’t hurt to try. I mean, I think if things were different-- Things aren’t different. But I appreciate what you’re trying to do. I don’t particularly think you’re doing such a bad thing. I mean, I don’t think you’re a bad person. I am. It’s okay though. None of these people are bad. You’re not a bad person, but things are what they are. - I don’t know what to say. - Say you’ll help me do this. Do this one good deed. Frank: It’s cool. So how do you intend for Jonas to get away? Out that door right there. There’s a 12-foot wall out there. What other way is there? Well, if you get the ladder to go up to the first part of the roof, and-- and then if you scale the fence, you can get out through a neighbor’s backyard. What about you, Frank? I’m going out the front door with a white flag. [scoffs] [chuckles] Well, I’m not into this, man. This is bullshit. How am I supposed to go out that door? - There’s probably cops out there. - Yeah. And you can use a couple of these people to get away until you’re in the clear, man. You’re gonna get away. Come on. Who wants to help Jonas get away? Who’ll volunteer to go out with him? I’ll go with you, Jonas. - Yeah, I’ll help. - See? - You’re gonna get away. - What about me, Frank? Huh? I’m not into this, man. It’s bullshit! I didn’t sign up for this. Jonas, don’t be stupid, man. This is the only chance for you to get away. Don’t fuck it up. I’m afraid. Don’t be. You’re gonna get away. You’re gonna get away. Okay, is everybody ready? Alright, Jonas. You guys got to get over to the door and get ready to make a move here. Here. Don’t forget to get me out, alright? Alright? I will. Good luck. Jake: See, you gotta face reality. You’re already dead. So there’s nothing to fear. [police radio chatter] Brass: Drop the gun. Drop your weapon immediately! Drop the gun, asshole! Jake: Francis, I love you. But you’re going down. Brass: Lose the gun! Drop the goddamn gun! - [gunfire] - Frank! No, no. Come on! - Wait here! - Jimmy! Frank! [sobs] [gunfire] - Freeze! - Don’t shoot, don't shoot. - Freeze! - Put the gun down. Put it down! There are worthier lives than yours. [grunts] [sobbing] Princess... did you see where the other guy went? Did he get away with my money? Princess, did you see where the other guy went? Does he have the money? Brascoe: If you tell us where the money is... you might get to live. Fuck you. You know, you’re not gonna win any awards for enduring pain. And that is exactly what you’re gonna get unless you tell us what we wanna know. Doesn’t matter to me. - I don’t know nothing, man. - [chuckles] We could do this all day. Just fuck off. Hold him still. I don’t want any blood on my shirt. - [snick] - [Jonas screams] [whimpers] Where’s the money? [sobs] I don’t know. Again. Where is the money? [crying] Hey, Jonas. It’s not polite to point. [laughing] [screams] Oh, fuck! [whimpers] Holy shit! Fuck! Fuck that. [shouts] The money, the money! Give me the fucking money! - I have to call you back. I have a customer. - The money! The money! - I have to go. Okay. - Come on! Give me the money! - Open the cash! Come on! - What, you want my money? Open-- yes! I want the-- open the cash! It’s no problem. I give you my money. Here. Here. Take my money. Come on. What’s the matter? My money not good for you? You don’t want my money? What’s the matter with you? My money’s good as anybody’s money. Come on! Ha ha ha. Come on, funny boy. Come here. What’s the matter? You chicken? [clucking] Man: Come on, let’s go. Jake: So what’s the story, morning glory? You headed east? I gotta get the fuck outta Dodge. That is precisely where I’m headed, sugar. Hop in. Oh, do you like my nails?
