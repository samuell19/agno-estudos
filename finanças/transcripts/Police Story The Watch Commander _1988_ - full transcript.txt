[VOICE OVER POLICE RADIO] Eileen, don't move. Hear 'em? Hear what? Back gate. Somebody's out in the yard. -Don, there's no one in the yard. -Shh! -You were sound asleep. -Check the kids' room. The kids are fine, I just looked in on them. I promise you, there's no one out in the yard. Just keep the lights off. Don't be afraid. I can't help being afraid. This is three times in one week... There's been a prowler, I know, I know. This is the last time. [SWINGS CREAKING] [THUDDING] [GUN SHOTS] Oh, my God! [BABY CRYING] They got away. Did you see them? Yeah, two, maybe three of 'em. Dark, Latin. Not Mexican, I don't think. Not juvenile. Damn! I don't know how I missed them. Are you all right? Everything's fine. Go on back to bed. Thought we'd be safe with a police officer living next door. [NEIGHING] You don't like the idea, do you, buddy boy, huh? Nobody's gonna put a saddle on you, huh? All right. No television for a week. You hear me, huh? Joe! Telephone! All right. Okay, saved by the bell. But, I'll be back. Remember, Joe Wilson doesn't give up. -Who's winning? -The animal kingdom. They've got two legs on us. Your family or mine? Neither. Don Carpenter's wife. Hello, Eileen? -Sorry to bother you. -Oh, it's no problem. Did the same thing? Last night he thought he saw a prowler and he shot at them. You sure no one was out there? Yeah, I was gonna wait until I saw you guys again, but I don't know what to tell the neighbors or the kids. I don't know how to help him. Well, tell them it was a prowler and Don ran 'em off. -Give me a chance to talk to him. -Okay. And, look, we'll work it out, you just hang in there. Is it okay if I call you? Now, you call anytime. Thanks. Bye. -Same problem? -Worse. He shot at them yesterday. Eileen's not gonna be able to hold it together much longer. I can tell from her voice. Either he's seeing ghosts or somebody's really after him. Either way, the man's in trouble. Oh, I really feel for Eileen. We're talking about an officer who had three commendations in the last year. What about on the job? Is it beginning to show? Nah, he's the best street cop in the Central. That can change, can't it? If he goes over that line... Yeah, it could change. Meanwhile, I've gotta worry about it. You always have. No, not always. Just the last 42 years. Forty-two years, where'd it go? It never ends, does it? [CHATTER OVER RADIO] You wanted to see me, Captain? Shake hands with Carl Corelli. Not Gino Corelli's son. Dad loved working with you. He used to drag me to all your Little League games. And look at you. [CHUCKLES] I'm assigning Carl to area duty officer on your watch. I lucked out. Show him the ropes, huh? Listen, the troops like to eat up new lieutenants. So, uh, Sergeant Wilson will run interference for a while, and then it's up to you. He's a Corelli. He'll do just great. He'll try. Head on down to roll call. Sergeant will join you in a minute. Yes, sir. And, uh, thanks. First day must be a thrill, huh? Close the door. Close the door? You usually hear that just before you're fired. Now, I'm not fired, am I? I'm late for a meeting, Sergeant. So let me get this out. I got a copy of your physical. Sixty-two push-ups. One for each year. It's very impressive. But not for a street cop. Look, you could be riding your horses all day long. Why don't you? Because that's not my job. Most men count the hours to their 20th year. You could have retired twice by now, and... Ridden into the sunset? Captain, I passed my physical, I passed my mental, I pass every test every year. Now, I don't wanna move up, I don't wanna move down. I just wanna stay on the streets. The streets, Sergeant, have changed. There's a war out there, you know that. We need an army to fight it, a young army. There's no corners left for the friendly policeman. There comes a time, a time to move over, a time to move on. And a time for roll call. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Good afternoon, campers. Fresh meat. Doesn't look so fresh to me. Still looks green. Thank God it's Monday. The weekend is history, and we've got a lot of follow-ups to make. First I wanna introduce Lieutenant Carl Corelli. Our new ADO. He'll also command team one. Lieutenant, anything you wanna tell them? Just that I'm happy to be here, and happy to be working in Central. I understand we had another singles bar murder last night. That's right, Sarge, all we got here is a homicidal maniac in a three-piece suit. He may look like a stock broker. But Saturday night he chopped the head off a 20-year-old co-ed from the Regency Estates. They found the rest of her at the 49er Motel. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Sergeant Wilson. Yes. Yes, Lieutenant. Oh. Good, thank you. Cordova, Johnson, Lieutenant Cruz. Your shooting with the liquor store bandits, the review board said it's a good one. Justified all the way. You can breathe again. Thank God. It was the longest Sunday of my life. Open it up, Schaeffer. Hmm. It's heavier than my gun. You on a safari tonight? Every night, Sergeant. There isn't one shell here that doesn't violate departmental regulations. Where'd you get these? I poured 'em myself, sir. Sergeant, confiscate these. Consider this a warning. The Captain... Sir, the creeps that Cordova and Johnson blew away Saturday night, what were they carrying? Cordova? One of them had an Uzi, the other, an AR-15. If these two guys hadn't been such good shots, there might be two less names here on roll call, sir. You could take out a shark with these. There's no lieutenant checking the bad guys' ammo. Well, as long as you're one of the good guys, you can expect the same thing next time in ranks. DISPATCHER: 1L14, return to base. JOE: [ON RADIO] 1L14. Roger. 1L14, that's Wilson's car. Sounds like he's taking Lieutenant out in the field. Well, I'd rather have a watch commander who hates the desk than one who sleeps on it. What you doing on your two off? I don't know, uh, Ensenada maybe. If the weather's good. New Lieutenant sticks pretty close to the books, huh? I hear he's got exactly 18 months on the street. That's all West Hills Division, pal. Yeah, well, he's gonna see more of action in Central before he leaves the parking lot. [CHUCKLES] That's for you. [CHATTER OVER RADIO] [CHATTER CONTINUES] 1L18 shows unit code six at East 15. The building's a bad setup, that's why we called for so much backup. It's just so quirky, you know? I usually come over about this time. We'd both close, and she'd fix a cup of coffee. I understand, Ms. Walter, but just tell me what happened. Well, the door is open. Now, that in and of itself is not unusual. But I noticed there were no customers, and the drapes were pulled in the back, my hand to God, she never pulls the drapes. So, I called to her, "Edna, Edna." There was no answer. Then, I thought I heard, like, footsteps in the back. And I knew something quirky was going on. You know how you can just kind of tell? So, I just got the hell outta there. Where's the cash register? Back corner. -Notice it when you went in? -Oh... I don't really remember. It was so quirky. All right. Thank you, Ms. Walters. You go over to that police car and we'll find out what's happening. All this because a lady thinks something quirky's going on? JOE: Hey, Lieutenant, she's a taxpayer. Besides, it'll only take five minutes. Ramirez, take these two men and close down the street. Right. Lee, you go around the back. Johnny, get on the roof. -You got it. -Who's going in? -Me and Carpenter. -No, really, who? Hey, now, don't get cute. Huh? Besides, I need the exercise. Now, come on, move. Lieutenant, let's go. -No cash register. -That's quirky. I heard something. All right, police officers, come out with your hands over your head. [SCREAMING] No! No! No! No! God! You're safe now. They got mad when they... When they found 100 in the register. Are they still in there? He raped me. Why? [SOBBING] You'll be all right, now. Come on, I'll take you out. [GUNSHOT] There's more than one, their shots overlapped. Building's surrounded, you've got nowhere to go. We'll bring the SWAT team in here, I promise they'll kill you! Come out now, at least you'll get as far as the courthouse. All right, man, we give. Throw your weapons out! We only got the 138. "We"? Don't bother coming unless you throw out another one. All right, come on out. [SHOUTING] [GROANING] -Shut up! -No! Shut the hell up! Read him his rights. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you. -Is that clear? Is that clear? -Yeah. Here we go, princess. I'm gonna call Eileen, you want me to call Margaret for you? We're gonna have a long night with the shooting team. No, I'll call her as soon as I finish this coffee. Unless it finishes me first. Where'd you get this? At the hotdog stand. Heard what went down, he gave it to us free. Must be rooting for the other side. Our squeaky clean lieutenant kind of froze in there, huh? Hey, I wasn't so fast to draw myself. Used to be, I'd get three rounds off to their one. -Think I'm slowing down? -No. World's sped up. [SIGHS] Yeah. -Make you dizzy. -[CHUCKLES] We're cops, we're in the merry-go-round business, right? What do you mean? I mean, we get paid to be dizzy, don't we? Ain't your head spinning? Didn't a stranger just try to kill us? We'd be lying in our blood. He gets a few years, he goes in, he comes back out again. It's a merry-go-round. It goes faster, faster every day. Yeah, it could make you dizzy. Get so dizzy sometimes, I could puke. What else? [SIGHS] You got enough on your mind now, Sarge, it can wait. Come on, talk. We've got a few minutes before the fireworks start. I don't know where or what connects to what bust. But couple of guys have started following my car home at night. I don't know, maybe I testified against someone, maybe I strong-armed somebody once, I don't know. You sure? What do you think, I made this up? You know how many crazies there are out there. You gotta watch out for them, Joe. ANNOUNCER: Police Story will continue in a moment. Hey. [RADIO CHATTER] I asked for a cookie, not a donut. That's all they had. That's great. Couple of cops, sitting around, eating donuts, that's something you don't see too often. No, there's something you don't see too often. Oh, yeah, looks like a couple of neurosurgeons, huh? Since when do you care about a woman's mind? Hey, we're not in high school anymore. -Give me some credit for growing up. -Growing up, right. Who's in Chinatown every night looking for anything that wiggles? Yeah, you gotta join me sometime. Now, why would a happily married man wanna do that? Why? You getting at something here? Or you just trying out your sick sense of humor on me? Eat your donut. This is not even glazed. I mean, if we're gonna be cliches here, we might as well do it right. Come on, let's get going. You know, you ought to be a little more sympathetic to today's single man. If they have a telephone, I'll send in a buck, all right? Gee, thanks. Me? I'll just stay married, not worry about getting dates on Saturday night. Well, you don't know how lucky you are, partner. If I'm so lucky, how'd I get stuck with you, huh? I didn't say good luck, I just said luck. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [SIGHS] Wilson, Central. Honey, I'm not even sure Joe likes lasagna. Well, talk him into trying it. You got a kiss for me? See you at 11:30, handsome. Yeah. Yeah, I got it. Bishop to queen four. All right, I'll call you tomorrow. [CHUCKLES] That watch commander at East Division thinks he's got my Queen. He'll learn. So, Carl, where did you get that pretty wife? I had to go to Kansas City four or five years ago, expedition case. She was a flight attendant, said either I gave my gun to the captain or I get off the plane. So, you surrendered your revolver. Yeah, among other things. Anyway, Joe, I guess I've spoken so much about you, that she sent some of her lasagna in. But you don't have to eat it if you're not hungry or you don't like it. Oh, listen, I love lasagna! You know, that's the street cop's problem. He learns to love all kinds of food. Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Japanese... You know, I envy some of these younger kids. Boy, they come in talking about Mongolian pork, salad from Thailand. I never knew that stuff existed in the old days. All right, lasagna it is. -Bread. -Mmm. Enjoy. Joe, I got the special team's report back on that incident in the garment district. It's now officially justified. Well, sure, Carpenter shot because he had to. You know that, you were there. There a reason anybody would think it any other way? No. No, no reason at all. Except that if he hadn't shot, he might have been in violation. What are you saying? I'm saying that a new lieutenant and an old sergeant sat on their guns. Something to think about. [SIREN WAILS] Listen, I gotta check my days off with the new lieutenant. Tell Nancy she's got another 20 minutes or so. No problem. I'll check the piece in and sign us out. Okay. He had to put in for his days off, so he's gonna be a while. Yeah, his father's coming in, it's real important to him. How are you doing? I've been better. That job thing work out? They wanted somebody fulltime. I'm not about to be anybody's fulltime. When do I see you again? It's gonna be difficult, isn't it? You're only off on Friday and Saturday. That's the problem with fulltime. If Lee gets off Friday and Saturday, I'm gonna be stuck with his father and the details of World War II. This whole thing is getting kind of nuts. You gonna come back to the house with him tonight? No, not tonight. It's getting tougher and tougher to sit across the room from you and pretend... Well, he's gonna think it's funny, maybe even be hurt if you stop. One of these days, or nights, he's gonna see it. I don't think so. I don't really know how much my husband trusts me. But I do know how much he trusts his partner. Don, how about a lift? Sure, no problem. Margaret dropped me to work today so she could use the station wagon. I'll deliver you to the door. No, your house will be fine. We can call from there and she'll pick me up. -How is she? You all right? -Adjusting. When your last daughter leaves for college, the house gets very quiet. I guess I've got quite a ways before that. [COMMENTATOR TALKING ON RADIO] What's the matter? The car behind us. JOE: Same car? I'll tell you in a minute. Same car, same couple. Hey, Don! They're just an ordinary couple. Man and wife with a car seat for their kid. No, no, I'm telling you, Joe, they've been after me three nights running. They're a bunch of cop-hating crazies, all of them. Slow down, Don. We'll pull them over, drag them out, and then you'll see. It's all your imagination, I mean, it's all in your head. [CAR HONKING] No, it's not inside my head, damn it, Joe! Take it easy, take it easy! MARGARET: Eileen's wound up pretty tight. JOE: I can imagine. MARGARET: She's all over the kids one minute, and then hugging them the next. She's beginning to be afraid of Don. I wasn't so calm with him. Doing 360s on Rose Avenue. He was actually ready to run down an innocent family. But he wouldn't hurt his wife and kids. He wouldn't hurt his wife and kids if he knew they were his wife and kids. What are you gonna do? I'm going to give the horse an apple. You know what I meant, about Don. -I don't know. -It's not your problem. Tell your lieutenant. He's been on the job exactly seven days. Besides, he's just a kid. Still has pimples. -Then go to Captain MacDonald. -Ah, it doesn't work that way. You mean you don't work that way. Everything has to be your problem. Look, Margaret, I don't wanna get into it tonight, all right? [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [HORSE NEIGHS] Joe? Joe? Have you noticed that there are some things you never wanna get into? You come home from work, you go out there to those horses and you escape. But not from your job, from me! Because you're still thinking about Don and all your men. It'll tear you apart someday, Joe, it'll tear us apart. Forty-two years. For God's sake, haven't you had enough? Go inside, Margaret. It's cold out here. How many partners you had so far this year, Jim? Four. No, five. You know how these young kids are, they come and go. We make them or break them, right, Joe? They're not all young kids. You're driving with Palmer now. He's got eight years in. He ain't that bad. He wants to work with another officer, too. Boy, I knew it. Sooner or later they all find something they don't like. You don't see me sandbagging a partner. In the last two months, I've had five different officers come in to me about you. They weren't all your partners either. Some people from around the station. You wanna hear a list of the complaints? You know, I bet that ammo I was using wasn't one of them. You let the other officer approach the car and write a ticket while you read a newspaper. You were sloppy in your searching of a second suspect. And you allowed a guy in an L car to handle what could have been a major 415 for 10 minutes, when you were less than four blocks away. That's a bunch of bull. I mean, these kids, they're hotdogs. They're all trying to set records. -So? -So... This is a notice to correct deficiencies. You went to the Captain with all this stuff? Well, you gotta talk to somebody. Whether it's me, your doctor, your buddy... You went to the Captain? Whatever happened to a warning shot? Whatever happened to Jim Schaeffer? [SIGHS] Maybe I've been slipping a little. Slipping? You passed slipping three months ago. I got a lot on my mind. Everything but your job. In our line of work, that could cost lives. Now, you find out what's eating you and take care of it. Right, Sarge. There's a lot of pressure on me about you. Everything at home all right? Well, home's a rented room, Joe. The, uh, ex took the kids. Back east. To be with the family. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Could you get some kind of a restraining order? She's got full custody. She can take them to the moon. Judge says, "Fine. "Send the alimony and the child support there." I borrowed so much money from the credit union for airplane tickets, I'm lucky I see them. Well, that is tough. But so are you. Now just bear down. I'm here if you need me. Joe, I'll try. It's... It's just been raining kind of heavy on me lately. Now, you can go back out in the field now, Jim. Let me know if you want to talk some more. Thanks. I'll try. I've never been any place but the streets. I'd hate to think I couldn't make it there now. Yeah. I know what you mean. Hey. How did he take it? Oh, good. He's a bitter man and he used to be a pretty good street cop. Is he going to shape up? I don't know. I got him talking anyway. Captain says if you want to transfer him out, he'll sign the papers in five minutes. Yeah. The Captain's got a quick trigger. Sure he'll sign the papers. He'll transfer him out. Whoever gets him will know and he'll transfer him again. Pretty soon he's pushing a pencil and checking in witnesses at traffic court. At least he'll last out his 20. Or maybe... Just maybe Schaeffer wants a little more than that. He's been a street cop, Carl. Once you play the streets, you don't want to finish your carrier in the minors. Joe, I'm not the enemy. I care as much as you do. Then care about the man. Not what the file says, not what the Captain says. The man, Carl. Listen to what he says. Care about him. -Dad? -In here, Son. -How you doing, sport? -All right. Catch any crooks? What, and spoil my record? -Where's Nancy? -She's at her mother's. At her mother's? At midnight? The old lady was feeling bad or something. Hey, listen. I drank a couple of bottles of your beers. That all right? Breaking and entering. That's a felony, Dad. But I can't bust my own dad, so... I'll give Nancy a buzz, see if she can pick up a six pack for both of us. Now you're not going to say anything to her about leaving the apartment, huh? I mean, poor thing has done nothing all day but fuss over me. She made a good dinner. I'm not going to say anything. -NANCY'S MOTHER: Hello? -Hi, this is Lee. I'm sorry to call so late. Is everything okay? Well, arthritis, but I'm not complaining. Oh, good. Uh, let me say a quick word to Nance, okay? Well, she's not over here, honey. Well, she was there earlier. She took me grocery shopping this morning, but that was hours ago, Lee. Um... My dad must have gotten her wrong. That sometimes happens. -Right. -You lose track. -Sorry. Good night. -No bother. Her mother all right? -Yeah, she's fine. -Was Nancy there? Just missed her. Come on, sit down. We're close to the cavalry charge. [GUNFIRE ON TELEVISION] You know, the first time we saw this cavalry charge, I was a little kid. It's probably what made you decide to be a cop. It's too late to become an Indian. You know, they don't make good pictures anymore. Well, Dad, they sure don't. Want another beer? As long as you're up. You must have grabbed one of the helicopters and flown home. No, not especially. How are you, Hank? Okay, gorgeous. How's your mother? Oh, she's pretty good. She, um... Where did you go, Nancy? Didn't your father tell you? He said you were at your mother's house. -And? -And I called your mother's house. What are you doing? Checking up on me? I was going to ask you to bring a couple six packs. I told your dad I was going to my mother's 'cause I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I mean, I've seen enough westerns for one weekend. Nancy, they said he's got less than a year. And I know that. And I try to make a really nice day for him. But the walls were closing in, okay? Don't make me out a villain. So where did you go, Nancy? Out. Away, to get some air. And where did you find your air? The bistro, the non-smoking section. I had a couple of drinks, I listened to some music. Do you want the address, Officer? -Did you go alone? -No, I picked up a couple of bikers. What is this? I thought we trusted each other. I'm sorry. You know, Lee, you make me feel... I said I'm sorry. It's just the thing with Dad... You go out to the cop bars, two or three nights a week with Johnny. They are filled with girls who want to hop into bed with anything with a badge on its chest. Do I shine the hot light in your eyes? I said I'm sorry. Let it go. Johnny call? Did Johnny call? No. Was he supposed to? Well, if he didn't go to Ensenada, he said he might stop by and have a beer with Dad and me. I'll give him a call. I'll take the beers out. [TELEPHONE RINGING] We're okay? Yeah, we're fine. Perfect couple. Hey, it's your midnight wake-up call. Who's sleeping? How's it going, buddy? All right, gave Ensenada a pass, huh? Yeah, all those babes and bikinis. Can't get any fishing done. Must be tough. You going to stop over? Not tonight. I've been working on the car all afternoon, went down to Chinatown and had a couple... -Couple of what? -Yeah, that too. Look, I'll come by tomorrow night and see your old man. What do you say? He'd like that. That'd be great. All right. I'll see you then, pal. Hey, give my best to him and Nancy, huh? All right. [RADIO CHATTER] Why so quiet? You should know your job is to entertain me. I was just thinking about roll call today. The new singles bar killing. You're mad 'cause we missed it again? Just don't like the competition, that's all. Guy goes around knocking off all the single girls. Where does that leave me? You're cute little partner, pal. Well, well, look who's here. Looks like Wilson is out in the field again, huh? Must be teaching the new lieutenant how to drive. MAN: [ON RADIO] 1L14, a possible 415 family dispute at 832 Carter Avenue. See the woman. See the woman what? Strip? Carl, you want to see the woman? MAN: All units in the vicinity in addition to 1L14, your call is now a shooting. Ambulance has been dispatched. Suspect still at location. 1L14, roger. We're rolling. Show time. [SIRENS BLARING] [WOMAN SPEAKING ON RADIO] She ain't going anywhere. Cancel the paramedics. Call the Coroner. Get down. Okay. He's still inside. One of us will have to go around behind that house. Got anybody around the back yet? Negative. We're just setting up. Cordova, Johnson, cover the back. What do you got inside? Nothing definite. A hunting rifle anyway. I saw a scope. And one fatality. The Lieutenant and I will work our way down that side. Call for more units, we'll gas him out. [GUNSHOT] Niko, trivia question. I'm ready, shoot. How many ridges on the edge of a dime? How many ridges? Think about it. All right, let's go. [GUNSHOT] MAN: Come on, you want to mix it up? Let's mix it up. What do you want? An engraved invitation, you jerks? We'll wear him out. We're in no rush. One hundred-eighteen. What? Don't tell Niko. There are 118 ridges on a dime. Can you believe it? [GLASS BREAKS] Get him? Point blank. [SIRENS APPROACHING] Cuff him. -But, Sarge, he's... -Policy. How about that, huh? Killed his wife on their 40th wedding anniversary. ANNOUNCER: Police Story will continue in a moment. Seventy-two. Seventy-three. Should I call an ambulance? Call the Guinness Book of Records. -Four. -It's not how many. It's how many, how fast. Joe, what the hell does all this mean? It means you'll call Dr. Shelby and make an appointment. And after as many appointments as he thinks are necessary, he'll make an evaluation. What is there for a shrink to evaluate about me? That's an official notice. It's signed by the Captain. -Stick it. -Hey, Don. Look, you may not like it, but I'm your superior officer. Superior? That's not what I hear. I hear when things get a little tense, you soil your pants. You tell me who needs a shrink. At least I don't wake up in the middle of the night, shooting at the imaginary boogie men. Who told you that? My wife come to you? She didn't talk to the Lieutenant, Don. Eileen called me. Oh, and you went to the brass? Listen, I was lucky to walk away from our little ride together. So was an innocent Mexican family. You tell the brass that too? Look, Don. The Doctor will just talk to you. Maybe he can help. You've been working too hard for a long time. There could be an illness, it happens. I'm not going to any shrink. The day I don't do my job, you come to me. Then... Then I'll go. CARL: Carpenter, the next step... I don't give a damn about the next step, Lieutenant. I used to be a guy who had friends around here. Sorry you feel that way, Don. How do you expect me to feel? You're busy sleeping with the brass. -I'll have to go the Captain. -I know it. Dammit, he's been a good cop for 10 years. Look at it this way. It's things like this that'll make me an old pro. Yeah. It's a lot of fun being an old pro. Thanks. Let me tell you about China. They make 'em pretty. -Look at that skin. -It's satin. Look, Dad, I sure wish you let me see if we can't get you on a flight. The bus station downtown... I'll only be in the bus station five minutes, and then we're out on the highway. I'll sleep for a couple of hours, wake up in time to see the sunrise over the desert. But it's such a long trip. It's long when you're 28, not when you're 63. I don't have anywhere I have to go quickly. Well, if I can't talk you out of it, I can't. What time do you want to take off? Ten minutes? I'll hit the john, we'll finish our drinks, and we'll be there in plenty of time. Now don't tell Nancy I had three of these. You look like your father, Morgan. I look that old, do I? How's business been, Irene? We're making it. -How's Johnny? -He's good. He should have checked in with you Sunday night. No, I don't think I've seen Johnny since the last time he was with you. Where else would he go in Chinatown? I'd kill him if he went anywhere else. Well, glad you could join us, Raul, Janice. Always glad to have two stars of the homicide team sitting in our little gatherings. We bear gifts. Hot off the press, Sarge. We just want to get them distributed. Well, step right up and tell us what you got. This is a composite and a general description of a prime suspect in the singles bar slayings. We have evidence that this guy, whoever he is, took a girl to the Blue Haven Motel last Friday night, raped and mutilated her. Hey, he looks just like Chief Walters. [ALL LAUGH] And even harder to find. We staked out every singles bar in the downtown area four nights running. But he didn't even try to hit on anybody. I know, I've been under cover and I'm insulted. ALL: Ooh! RAUL: Keep your eyes open. The Chamber of Commerce would like to see this one go away. All right, folks, hit the streets. Drive carefully and have a nice day. -Birdies? -Yeah, birdies. That's what they call us. But you know, it's not all just crawling around with binoculars and field books. To be real bird watcher, you have to study, keep records. It's a lot of work. I don't know where you find the time. On my days off, I'm either too tired to do anything or my wife won't let me leave her side. Well, when they marry a cop they marry the job. We're not the best catches, you know. I'm afraid my wife thought I'd make chief by now. Mr. big shot. Giving press conferences and going to parties and dancing in the spotlight. Is that what you want? I forgot. It started out noble enough, protect and serve and all that business. I don't know, somewhere along the line, I think my goals got a little mixed up. Anyway. How do people do it? Do what? How do people keep it all going? The wife, the job, kids. I mean, and still find time to watch birds, how? Carl, what you need is an Indian head nickel. I'm not following you. Now watch this. You can't do it with just any nickel, it has to be an Indian head. I learned this trick before you were born. A cop should it to me and then gave me the nickel for good luck. It's not easy to keep it going. Sometimes it's not even possible. The trick, the cop told me, was balance. Now, believe me, I don't always get it right, ask my wife. But I try. I try to balance it all out. It's a good trick if you can do it. Well, you're a Corelli, you can do it. What makes you so sure? Well, the cop that told me that trick was your father. You know, it's been a great reminder to me about balance, about a man, God rest his soul. I liked him an awful lot. You keep it, for good luck. [HORNS BLARING] What do you think? I think he broke the law. The trouble with stopping this kind of car is they always got warrants. So we bust him. Yeah, but you know how hungry I am. Run him in. Aren't we becoming the model soldiers. Just do it. 1A17, requesting outstanding warrants on Nevada plates 491-Adam-Paul-Adam. DISPATCHER: 1A17, automated warrant shows three outstanding traffic and possible felony for a 245 PC. Contact Harbor Investigation. 1A17, roger. [SIRENS WAILING] You're watching the female too, right? I'll watch 'em both, partner. I'll watch 'em both. You want to step out of the car, please? What's the problem, Officer? What you stopping me for? You ran a red light. You wanna both step out of the car now, please? May I see your driver's license, please? Take it out of the wallet, please. What's the difference, Officer? You can see the license. Take it out of the wallet. What, no please this time? Look, man, you got no reason to harass me, man. I didn't see no red... -You Cornell Helms? -Well, you're looking at my picture right there. -You drive, miss? -Sure, I can drive. Good. Cause your boyfriend is going to jail. Jail? For what? For running a red light? I ain't going to no jail, man. You can kiss... Jim, come on. Look, man, I know your badge number. I know your number, too. Get your white paws off me then. Oh, my God. Cool it. Stand back. [STRUGGLING] Hey, Sarge. Did you ever get a paper cut under your fingernail? Yeah. What's this about Morgan taking another night off tonight? He asked for a night off and I gave it to him. I'm not questioning that, Joe. It's just that in reviewing over the team records, he's usually the officer looking for more work, not less. He thinks his wife is fooling around. -That's why he's off tonight? -Yeah. You think that's a good idea? I don't think it's a good idea or bad idea. But I do know that every time in all the years that I've been on the force, when a guy thought his wife was fooling around, and asked for time off, he got it. It's standard operating procedure. But you didn't think to come to me about it. No, frankly, I didn't. Lee Morgan is an officer on my team. An officer who could go home, kill his wife, kill somebody else, kill himself, and I don't even rate in a share of that decision? I figured you'd do the same thing. You figured wrong. We haven't said this out loud to each other, and even though you're soft of training me around here, a sergeant still reports to a lieutenant. That is standard operating procedure. So from now on, Sergeant, consult me before any decisions are made. Any questions? Yeah. As long as we're speaking out loud, why can't you shoot your gun, Lieutenant? I looked at your file. Three-time medalist at the academy, marksman class seven. What's holding you back? Pardon me, Lieutenant. Internal Affairs needs to see both of you right away. I guess I better get upstairs. This Helms or Holmes or whatever his name is, is in critical condition. Is this Schaeffer on your team? Yeah. How long has Schaeffer been in Central? About three years now. Would you say you had a lot of trouble with him before? No, I wouldn't say that at all. What are you getting angry for? [SCOFFS] I'm not getting angry. You haven't heard his side of the story yet. No, no, no. All I've heard is, he beat the hell out of some guy on Lincoln Avenue in full view of a dozen witnesses. -Schaeffer? -Yes, sir. I'm Sergeant Layton of Internal Affairs. -Walker? -Yes, sir. Both of you are relieved from duty, but not suspended. We get upstairs, I will explain what rights you do and do not have. Take the young lady and get here statement. Wait a minute, I'm not the one who did anything. No, I know that, miss. I just want your story. And then you'll be free to go, all right? Fine. All right, I think that's all we can do for now. You'll inform the Captain that Schaeffer and Walker are relieved of duty pending investigation by Internal Affairs. Sergeant. Look, I'm sorry. I told Walker not to cover for me. That's all right, Jim. You better not say any more. -CARL: Sergeant Layton. -Yes, Lieutenant. Schaeffer is one of my men. I care about him. I trust he'll get a fair hearing. As far as I'm concerned, all cops are created equal. But the decision to press criminal charges rests with the DA. And he happens to be one hell of a bastard. [GASPS] Oh, God. Get out of his bed, Nancy. LEE: Right idea, keeping a gun by the bed. Wouldn't have done you much good, though, leaving your doors unlocked and everything. I'm surprised, good cop like you. How long has it been going on? Six months. Six months? I was really stupid, huh? No, you weren't stupid, Lee. I swear to God. I was going over to your house for over a year before I let myself think of any... Anything happened with Nancy. What about you, Nancy? Did it take a year for you to get warmed up too? I don't know, I don't remember exactly. You're scaring me. I fought it, Lee. I swear to God, I didn't want this to happen. I used to envy you. Bachelor cop, all the freedom. I didn't know just what a stud you really were. I love Nancy. This isn't just about getting it on. You love her? Lee, put the gun down. Lee, you have father with less than a year to live. -Do you want him to spend that... -[SHOUTS] Shut up, slut. You don't use that on me. How did you find out? Does it really matter? You told me. He told me. Little lies. Lots of little lies that add up. You said you went to the bistro and I left it at that. Johnny said he was in Chinatown and I left it at that. Until Irene at the Red Dragon said she hadn't seen him in weeks. You checked the other bars then? After I put my dad on the bus. He still loves to ride the bus. Loves to see the sun come up on the desert. He could tell you what it means to love somebody. And then I checked the Oasis Cafe last night. They remember both of you there. Acting like newlyweds, they said. Were you going to leave me, Nancy? No. I thought about it. I wasn't sure it would help or change anything. Lee, I want to get dressed. [UNCOCKS GUN] Sure. Nancy. Yes, Lee. Someday, somebody probably will kill you. I know. [DOOR CLOSES] Hello, Jim. Sergeant. Aren't you taking a chance coming in here? Not especially. Layton can complain to the Captain or the Lieutenant, but they don't like him any better than I do. He's out to hang me. Maybe not. Emergency ward says that Cornell Helms is out of danger. Oh, thank God. Do you need anything? No. I mean, uh, they ought to put a magazine or two in here. I look at my watch, I think five hours has gone by, it's been 20 minutes. I know. I sweated a couple of these things out myself. It's funny... I've never even been in this part of the building before. One trip in 16 years. Boy, I don't like this place. You getting tired of telling people what happened, then? I snapped. I lost my head. I don't remember most of it. Now, I just keep trying to remember back, 10, 20 years, to when things were better. Easier to figure out. I thought maybe if you took a trip back to see your kids... I know, Sarge, thanks. I found the ticket in the locker. I'll pay you back the money. What happened the last time you went back there? It was, uh, pretty bad. I didn't even seem to be able to talk to the kids. Half the time, I'd go back to pick them up, he's there, and so I'm angry. Your wife is living with somebody else? Yeah! Yeah, right there in front of the kids! My kids! I mean, what the hell kind of environment is that to bring them up in? This, uh... This guy she's living with, is he black? Yeah. Young? Yeah. Just like the guy you beat up. Have you told IA any of this? No. I didn't think they'd really care. You need some cigarettes? Not now, he doesn't. Wrap it up, Schaeffer. You're going upstairs. Don't leave anything behind. You're not supposed to be here. Well, call a cop. Your man's through. Board of Rights gonna fire his ass. What about criminal charges? Yeah, we recommended it to the DA. Don't you know? People go to jail for what Schaeffer did. And like I always say, cops are people, too. Layton, there ought to be a law against you. Eileen? Eileen? Joe, the horses look great. Their coats are really shining. Wish that meant I didn't have to groom them anymore. You love to complain about those horses. [MUTTERS] What would you do without them? Well, I guess I'll just have to ride you. You know, Margaret, about the other night... No, forget it. It's history. No, you're right. I... I do get moody. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, times 42 years... I'd say you're entitled to get a little moody now and then. As long as I'm entitled not to like it. All right. I'll try and snap out of it, huh? [SIGHS] Are you that tired? No. I got that rocking chair to refinish. Oh, well, go ahead. And when you finish with that, the roof needs re-shingling. And there are a couple of other things around here that need attention. [HORSE NEIGHING] Oh, Joe, I love you. You know that. I just hate the way that job takes little pieces out of you every day. I know, Margaret. I know that. [TELEPHONE RINGING] I know. Yeah? -Joe, this is Don. -Don? How's everything? I just... I got home and Eileen... Eileen has taken the kids, taken all of her clothes... I'll be right over. Trouble? Eileen left him. She packed up everything and took the kids. You're going over there? He sounded pretty bad. You'll see him tomorrow. He needs me now. I'm sorry, Margaret. [DOOR CLOSES] ANNOUNCER: Police Story will continue in a moment. Guess Walker's gonna come out of it okay. Gets his badge back today. LEE: Yeah, it's tough with all those witnesses. Anyway, I heard Schaeffer didn't deny anything, so... How's it going? It's going. Going, going, gone. JOE: Okay, listen up. Car assignments. -1Z18, Cordova? -Here. -And Johnson. -Yo. 1A22, Morgan? -Here. -You ride with Walker. Welcome back, Eric. Thanks, Sarge. 1L34, solo patrol, Reynolds. 1L34 solo. Okay, Marge, I'll see you in the morning. Okay... Excuse me. Are you Deputy District Attorney Parkinson? That's right, Sergeant. What can I do for you? I'd like to talk to you about Jim Schaeffer. I'm familiar with the case. I understand it's up to you what happens to him. Well, not entirely, Sergeant, but if you mean will I prosecute, yes, if prosecution is indicated. And I'm not sure you and I should be having this conversation. Well, whether you talk to me or not is up to you, but this is important. What was Schaeffer to you, Sergeant? He was on my night watch for three years. I think there's some things you should know. Internal Affairs made a very thorough investigation. Yeah, they usually are very thorough. Well, what do you think they've missed, Sergeant? Well, he had 16 years in. Four short of his pension, which he's as good as lost. That's a familiar argument when policemen break the law. You should have unloaded this guy years ago. You know that. I don't unload people who give their all. He's laid his life on the line a couple of times. His wife left him three months ago. She went east and took the kids. They all have stories. He's now living in a rented room. He's going into debt trying to pay for alimony, child support, plane tickets. You see, it's hard enough to be a cop. But then, when you have these... That's still no reason to beat up an innocent citizen. [CHUCKLES] Wait a minute, the kid did make a move on him. The officer overreacted, Sergeant. The officer, Mr. Parkinson? The officer spent half his life enforcing the law. Then one day, he breaks it. Can't the law give him a break? What is it about cops? The last time Schaeffer flew east, he found his wife living with another man. A black man. Well, I must admit that IA missed that one. Well, they usually are very thorough. Sergeant, do you realize you're asking me, a black man, to feel sorry for a white cop who nearly beat another black man to death, on the grounds that his ex-wife is now living with yet a third black man? Well, I just thought you should know all the facts. Thank you for giving me your time, Mr. Parkinson. Cops. They ought to be more careful, they're gonna screw up the plumbing. Is that your dinner? Yeah, Sarge. It's no problem. I'll go around the corner and get a couple of tacos. You wanna join me? It's all over the station what happened last night, Reynolds. Well, I gathered that. If it doesn't bother you, riding alone, and pulling your food out of the toilet, it doesn't bother me. But what happens if you run into trouble, and you need some backup? You think they might be a little slow in getting there. I've seen it happen. And I don't want an officer killed. I'll talk to the Captain. All you have to do is put in for a transfer and you'll be out of Central... I don't want out of Central. Last night, Sergeant, when Lee came through that door, and found me with Nancy, I've never been so scared, felt so guilty in all my life. You think that staying in Central is paying for some kind of penalty? I don't know. I don't know what it is. I mean, I know it'd be easier for Lee, it'd be easier on myself, it'd be easier on the department if I transferred out. I'm not gonna take the easy way. Well, you're gonna be pretty much alone, Reynolds. Yeah, well, maybe that's what I need. Wilson, I don't know what you said to the DA, but you can call Schaeffer and tell him no criminal charges will be filed against him. I can tell Schaeffer that, Captain? Yeah. Jim? Jim? [SNIFFS] [SNIFFING] Jim! Jim! [COUGHING] [GAS HISSING] ANNOUNCER: Police Story will continue in a moment. Joe... Hi, honey. It's almost 3:00. Guess I lost track. [CHUCKLES] -What's the matter? -You tell me. You didn't say a single word all evening. -Oh, I'm sorry. -I'm not trying to criticize you. It's just that I try to start a conversation, I think you're listening, and then, I lose you. Well, I guess I'm getting old. You're not old. But the older you get, the more this job seems to get to you. Come on, let's go in. I don't wanna go in. I wanna talk. I wanna know. Why do you stay when you could quit tomorrow and never have to worry about the bills? Or guys like Morgan and Carpenter and Reynolds and Schaeffer. Well, I won't have to worry about Schaeffer anymore. Then why? What's out there for you? It's the other half of my life. It's my job, Margaret. It's who I am. You put me on the front desk? Handing out visitors' passes, logging in the night cleanup crew. That's a job you give gray-haired waiting to go out to pasture, rookies out of the academy who are the bottom of the class! What is this, Joe? It's a decision. Made by more than one man. I'm going to see the shrink. I'm on my way right now! I'm doing exactly what the department wanted. That's fine. If Eileen comes back, that's all to the good. But you don't get sick overnight, you don't get well overnight. Now, Don, the department's only trying to help you. The department would have fired me if I hadn't gone to see a shrink. What if somebody thought the garbage man was crazy. A supervisor's gonna fire him unless he sees a shrink, could he? -No. -No. But then, we don't give guns to garbage men. Even a sanitation strike isn't a matter of life and death. You put me on that damn desk, I really will go around the bend. It's only temporary. You can't take me off the street! Don, you're making your life hell. No. No. You. You, Joe, you're the one that's doing that to me. Garcia and Wesley went in early and picked up the guy in the circular. The singles bar suspect. Hey... He's clear on all but the last murder. Copycat. Which puts them only a mile behind where they were before. Not quite. We have a vague description of another possible suspect. Male Caucasian, 28 to 35 years old, brown hair, well-dressed. JANICE: Our witness was a bartender who saw the man with the second victim, shortly before she died. We'll be taking him with us from bar to bar tonight. We want a couple of black and whites to back up any arrest. All right. 1Z18, Cordova and Johnson, 1A22, Morgan and Niko, 1Z19, Bass and O'Rourke. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] I don't know. Maybe I should have gone to work tonight. Look for him there. Maybe. He's never been known to take a girl out of the same bar. -Another drink? -Nah. Hey, I'm not 1,000% sure, but I think he just came in. Maybe if I could hear his voice. We can arrange that. DISPATCHER: Unit 1L14, come in. 1L14, roger. WOMAN: 1L14, stand by, patching the landline on code C. Go ahead. Lieutenant Corelli, Garcia. We're at the Paradise Lounge, 10th and Broadway, about to positive ID our suspect. We're en route, I'll stay on the line. [SIRENS WAILING] -Excuse me. -Sure. Hi. They're the best slopes I've seen all year. -And then in summer, I do Maui... -What's your name? So, where do you work? -I was with the airlines, but... -I'll be back. ...I'm between jobs now. -Yeah? -Yeah. I always get along well with airline stewardesses. No doubt about it. That's him. Fine. Thanks. Now wait for us outside. It's going down, Lieutenant. Just pulling in. We'll be right up. Sir, police officers. We'd like to talk to you for a few moments. What about? I think it'd be easier and less embarrassing if we spoke outside. Are you trying to tell me I'm under arrest or something? Not unless you want it that way, sir. Whatever you say. Oh, so you're one of them, too. That's right. Hey, darling, you don't wanna leave. -Hey! Hey, hey! -[JANICE SCREAMS] Get away from me or she's dead! Are you keeping something from me? [SHOUTS] Get out! Get out! [SCREAMS] I'm for real! [SIREN WAILING] [CHATTER OVER RADIO] What's the latest? He's got Janice Wesley up on the roof. He's got her gun. He wants a telephone. -What about SWAT? -They're on alert. But he says if he sees any of our "Those cops in baseball caps and flak jackets," we're minus one policewoman. Where's Sergeant Wilson? I thought he was wounded. Yeah, he and the Lieutenant are lining up a shot, off that building. When the hell is he gonna act his age, huh? All right, just put the phone down and get out of here. Airline stewardess? You wanna fly tonight, honey? You may get a chance. Hello. Yeah, yeah, yeah, who's this I'm talking to? This is Captain MacDonald. What is it you want? Now, I know you got a no-hostage policy, but I want you to remember she's one of your own. I'm telling you, you try and funny business, and I start throwing down body parts. We're not trying anything. Okay, here's what I want, and I want it fast. A helicopter with a real pilot. Not FBI agents in pilot's uniforms. He lands up here, takes me, and I let the lady go. Yes? Niko, don't let them get too close. Get them over the side. JOE: Even if he dies instantly, -he could still squeeze the trigger. -Reflex action. Wilson here. All right, we're going for it. We got one chance. It's gonna take a perfect shot. We need a rifle. [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] -We don't got time. -We're too far away. Not anymore. Here. We got one of Schaeffer's torpedoes. -Here. -No, Joe, I can't. I can't either. He got me on my shooting hand. Besides, you got the lucky nickel. There's no way, Joe. Yeah, there's a way. Imagine a target. Cardboard cutout on the range. Just don't put a face on it. Come on. Hold on, honey. We're going for a ride. But you told me I wasn't going. [LAUGHS] What, you don't like me? CARL: It's too dark. I can't get this shot off. There's one thing bird watching teaches. That's patience. The chopper will hit its landing lights. At that moment, it's target practice. Joe... You can do it. You can do it, Lieutenant. [CHATTER OVER RADIO] Sergeant... -How's Janice? -She's shaken up. But happy to be alive. Your new lieutenant did all right up there. He said he had some help. That's my job. Don't come back till that thing's healed. CARL: Anyway, I gotta get going. I just wanted to check up on you, see how you were doing. And, uh, thank you again, for all that you did. So... Thanks, Joe. For everything. I put your things in your locker. They'll be waiting for you. So will the guys. Thanks, Carl. I also put your holster in your locker. I noticed it was right-handed. Your shooting hand was as good as mine last night, Joe. You needed the practice. Yeah. I'm gonna break that horse in with one hand and I got six weeks to do it. Correction, Sergeant, you got four weeks. I checked with the travel agent. He says the only blue uniform you're gonna see on that ship is the captain's. Great. Another captain? Hey, Joe. What is this? I hear you two are vacationing courtesy of the PD? MARGARET: Don? Margaret. How are you gonna stand it? Being cooped up all that time with this guy? Well, I guess I'll just have to work real hard at it, won't I? How's the wing? Oh, I'll fly again. You know, I saw that shrink. Pretty straight guy. Eileen came along, too. Wasn't as bad as I thought. She hasn't moved back yet, but, uh, we'll keep working at it. Well, listen, takes time. Yeah. Joe, about what I said... You mean about Margaret being cooped up with me? No, no. Um... [SIGHS] Listen, uh, where are those brochures? MARGARET: Oh, right in the desk drawer. Hey, how would you fellas like some cold beer? -Terrific. -Sounds great. Listen, I'm gonna show you a couple of pictures of the best ship you've ever seen. Margaret and I are gonna get on that ship. The only thing is, she tells me there's a captain... [CHATTER OVER RADIO] WOMAN: Next onPolice Story. Domestic violence is one possibility. What's the other? Revenge. She was lucky to have a friend like you. What we have is recreational sex. What recreational sex? We get along, we've known each other for a long time. You're sleeping with her, aren't you, Jack? Being alone is a lot better than being with someone who's gonna keep you cut off! What the hell would you know about being alone? You're under a lot of stress. You need to slow down. I am worried about you. -Who killed Janet Wilson, Julio, you or Urbano? -Officer! -[GUN FIRING] -[SCREAMING] Freeze!
