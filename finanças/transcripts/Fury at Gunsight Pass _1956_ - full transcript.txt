FURY AT GUNSIGHT PASS 1956 -Everything is ready. -Did you like I said? Every step. -The purse is in the bank vault. - Tell me everything, Whitey. The banker stayed in the palm of my hand. I said, '' Mr. Hanford, if I find the right place, I will be happy to settle in your little town for the rest of my life. '' Great, Whitey. I can see everything. I spoke to Boggs first. You have to see his chapel. Weddings and funerals in the same place. It has a great funeral home. Organ, flowers, everything. Living like Boggs for the past three years can change the way you think. Why does he want to help us steal money from the bank? You know, he might want us to be captured to keep the reward. Have you ever seen a scorpion catch a snake with its tail? That is his reason. Your wife. He would give an eye to get rid of her. He wants to ride with Dirk again, so he told us what he knows. Chief, I've been watching the Mormon storehouse all week. He's there now waiting for the transfer to Salt Lake. $ 35,000. After this theft, the reward for me must increase. How much are they offering for you now, Dirk? $ 15,000. They are offering $ 25,000 for Jesse James. -You get there. -I'm going to die trying. -And the sheriff? -He's leaving town in the morning after the wedding. He will hitch a ride on the stage from the couple to the neighboring city and will only return at dusk. -When will we attack? -Something around 13:00. At that time everyone will be off the streets. The men will be sleeping drunk because of the marriage. It would be a shame to wake them up. Then we will make a friendly visit at 13:00 h. We will act safely. You and three of the guys are going an hour before. As always. Choose your men. Same old, O'Neil, Daley and Okay, Okay. I'll still find someone to sew for me. -Who would have the courage for that? -You know, when this is all over, I will sit in a barber chair for a week. Just wearing perfumes. Everything will be fine with me. Why don't you take a shower too? A shower? And drop my gun? Okay, all four of you go to Gunsight at noon. The rest of us will arrive an hour later. 1 pm sharp. We will both go to the bank together. -It's getting in and out. -Yes, as always. Okay, we're far enough away from the others. -Today is the day. -Are we going to steal ourselves? $ 35,000. It gives almost $ 9,000 each. This is better than the $ 4,000 if we stick with Dirk. If Dirk catches us, we won't have a dime. He will not catch us. We will part ways at the end of the day. Every man for himself. That was the deal. It's fine with me, as long as I'm rich. I'm going to Mexico. I'll buy one of those chic saddles covered in silver. Those that go to the ground. I'll get one of those pretty Mexican girls. I'm going to Canada. I will lie down all day in one of those warm lakes and I will look at the snow on the horizon. -Where are you going, Whitey? -What difference does? I will return to the reservation. With $ 9,000, they'll make me a boss. I will have my own harem and I will not have to sew. Wait a minute, we're counting it wrong. And the Boggs part? We will divide it into four parts. I'll take care of Boggs. It's 9:30 am, we better hurry. No, we will take it easy. We will arrive at the bank at noon, I will ask for my bag and it will be over. That gives us an hour to get away before Dirk arrives. -He will have a great reception. -Maybe he's shot. Well, it'll be good if they hang you. It's 11:45 am and the minister hasn't arrived yet. Since I moved to this city, we have never had a minister arrive time for a wedding or funeral. I thought the wedding would be sooner. I always say that the longer you wait, the happier the couple will be. You are not speaking for me, Squint. Roy. Roy. How long will I have to wait, dear? -I want to marry. -Don't look at her, Roy Hanford. It is unlucky to look at it before reaching the altar. -Did you see my father? -I saw him entering the bank ten minutes ago. And don't speak behind my back. If I do that, it will only be for the best. I will marry my daughter to a great boy. Yes, Kathy deserves the best. You too, doctor. 20 years here bringing us into the world, listening to us, praying with us, burying us. Yes, you deserve the best. -Hello, sheriff. -Where do you think you're going? -This is reserved for the newlyweds. -I'll just get a ride. Sam wants me to witness his will. -Sam '' Cow hand ''? - $ 5 for the trip and $ 5 for the core fee. Of course, I could talk about honesty, trust and integrity. But on a day like this, son, father's advice is worthless. -Then I won't give any. -I need? You are the last person in the world I want to disappoint. Maybe I should make him stay here and manage the bank so that I could escape and have fun. This offer is late, isn't it? I will be Chief Justice of the U.S. before Christmas. You didn't send me to law school for 3 years for nothing. - It cost your father $ 3,328. - It's just money, Andy. Excuse me, ladies. Why are you looking at your watch, Mr. Boggs? -You're not going anywhere. - I told you last night, honey. I have a business commitment at Clear Water. I must leave in an hour, that marriage should be over. -What difference does it make? -I may lose the sale of a coffin. Marriage is more important than a funeral, leave your watch alone. Here comes the reverend. Finally. -It is. -Roy. Keep loving Kathy as much as I loved your mother. I'll do it. Reverend, you're late, but you're all set. My wheel dropped six miles from the city. I went back to the road looking for the junction and didn't find it. There it was, crawling in the dust. No one to help me, besides the good Lord and that piece of rope. As long as you're here, Reverend. Some of us have other commitments. Look, can you make the ceremony shorter this time? We must not rush a wedding, Mr. Boggs. I never shorten the instructions, I always believed in saying everything. Yes, sir, I always start with a long prayer. Then some music, then I give the sermon. So a little more music. At this point, everyone is ready for votes. I always end with a blessing. I brought a great sermon. Yes, very good. Tell the reverend to shorten the sermon. Don't you think he knows what he's doing? And keep that watch or I will destroy it. Don't forget you're my best man. Aren't you coming, Andy? -Everything has been told. -We'll be there. We have to lock everything. Only the two of us are left, Andy. Four of us came to Gunsight, now only the two of us are left. Makes you remember, doesn't it? You, me, Mary and little Roy. -Yes, and the $ 8,000 you won. -You still remember the game we won. Don't include me, you played with my $ 100. I never played. It is a sin and a fever in the blood. -Once a player... -Well, it was worth it. - It allowed us to start here. -Playing is the same as stealing. It's like putting your hand in someone else's pocket. -A player is a thief. -Andy, in all these years I never touched a cent of bank money. You have a good reputation now. Nobody knows your story, except me. And you will never forget, will you? What are you doing? Lift this curtain. I'm closing the bank. We won't have any more business today. - We have time to close. -Andy, take a break, even if half a break. Nobody in the city will care. I will reopen it after the wedding. We are already wrong to keep it - closed for an entire hour. -Andy, today is not a day to discuss. Do whatever you want. There is the warning. Andy, you don't change. But I like you. Okay and I will take the money. Leave the horses beside the bank. -We will leave there. -And Boggs? He'll meet us behind the city and that's where we'll leave him. I have to say, Whitey, you have thought of everything. I said Boggs would cheat on us. They don't close banks at noon. You said Boggs told you that the wedding would start early. What does this have to do with the bank being closed? Everything is the son of the banker who is getting married. Yeah, the whole town and the sheriff are there. What are we waiting for? We will invade and break into the safe. -We shoot whoever shows up. -No, we can die. That would be simple. And this is how we will do it. It's midday. - Dirk will arrive at 13:00. -The wedding will end eventually. Once it's over... Do not blame me. The minister's wagon broke down. -He's late. -How long will we have to wait? I don't know, 20 minutes at most. - Hurry them up. - I'll try. I better go, my wife will miss me. Okay, take it easy. Don't look so scared and sneaky. Maybe we better drink. Let's go. Squint, when you finish cleaning those bowls, I want you to get that wide basin in the back room. Miss. Cleary will start making the punch. -And turn that picture. -Mrs. Finley... Don't argue with the committee, we rent this place all day. -Whisky. -Whisky. -Yes sir. -Squint! Remember? You know, we're having a wedding party here, guys. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we won't serve any -whisky until the party is over. -And get this monstrosity out of here. -I can serve you water. -And charge us? No, everything is free today. You can drink whiskey later. -Thanks, we'll try to wait. -You're strangers around here, aren't you? Not exactly, I was in town yesterday afternoon. I left a bag with Mr. Hanford at the bank. I came to get it. We are looking for a ranch to buy. -Do you intend to settle here? -Perhaps. These are some of my men, we're on our way to Arizona. -We intend to buy cattle. -Old Hanford and his son are very popular. You know, we're trying make that day the most unforgettable in the city. Well, if we can help, we'll do our best. -The wedding shouldn't take all day. - There's no way to hurry the Reverend. He once gave a sermon of more than two hours at a wedding. -IT IS? We don't like to wait. -We will wait. -Do you have a deck? -Yes sir. Here it is Sir. Choice. This will do. 20 minutes to 13:00. -It was very well arranged. -We won't get anything. Shut up. Mrs. Cleary said that I could serve you punch. Thank you, we don't drink this. -They are still singing. -Poor marriage. We won't get the $ 9,000. Dirk will appear any minute and we will have to share as usual. We will only get $ 4,000. It must be over. The marriage is over. - We only have 15 minutes. -We'll only need ten. Take the horses to the bank's side door. Come with me. -Hello, Mr. Hanford. - Hello, Mr. Turner. -Nice to see you again. - This is Johnny Oakes. -He's been with me for years. -How are you? I hate to interrupt you on a day like today, but I would like to catch that bag I left with you yesterday. -Yes, your money. -That's right. I thought I wasn't going to get it for a few days. It was what it looked like yesterday, but I didn't find any ranch here that interested me. I'll take a look at Colorado. Well, if you join me at the wedding party for an hour... I've already lost an hour, Mr. Hanford. My plans depend on my - leave as soon as possible. -I'll take care of that, Charlie. -Go with Roy. -Andy, I'll take care of it myself. I changed the combination of the safe this morning. Did you change the combination without telling me? Yes, Andy, I was thinking about Roy and the wedding and I forgot to tell you. Come on, gentlemen. Go to the party, Andy. This will only take a minute. Eat a piece of cake. And drinks are free. - Anyone coming? -Not. Seven minutes to 13:00. I passed the number. That's what happens when if you're in a hurry. You know, on a day like this, I can barely think about business. My only son is leaving. I know how you feel, I once had a mule, so stubborn that I hit her. She fell ill and I left her for a day with the doctor. Just one day and I've never missed anything so much in my life. Save your stories. -Mr. Boggs. -Yes darling? Clean the chapel before going to Clear Water. Yes darling. Naturally. A toast from the groom. Make a toast. Well, I don't know any gifts. Of course I can recite poetry. -Or I can sing a song. - Sing the song. I love you, darling, but please don't sing. Of all the gifts around the world. None compares to this alliance. Cut the cake. What's the matter, Andy? I can't understand why Charlie changed the combination of safe without telling me. It is. Drop this bag and bring the church money. -You will never leave town. - 5 minutes to 13:00 h. Come on, get in there! We can't ride with it. Break it in and fill the bag. Let's go fast. There are four of us, you have no chance. We have three minutes. Help! The bank is being robbed. Sheriff, they are there now. I don't know how many. Spread out. -Fill the bag. -Let's go! Let's go. I'll take that, I'll hide the money in one of the coffins. Whitey wouldn't start anything before we got here. He's in trouble. - Let's go to the bank. -There are more of them there. Let's get out of here. Hold it. Do not shot! -The box is empty. -Where is the money? I do not know. It is not with us. One of them is out there. Let's go. It's him. What did you do with the money? What did you do with him? The others took it from me and ran away with it. -We shot their horses... -Thank God, it's fine, Dad. -Where's Roy? -He's in the bank. Something terrible to do... Honey! -Where's Mr. Boggs? -Where's Charlie? -Andy, he's dead. -Is Charlie dead? -I'm sorry, Andy. -Is the money safe? The others took his money and ran away. $ 35,000 is gone. Wait a minute! No one will be hanged. Take them to jail. Wait. Do not make threats. I will have to shoot the first man to touch the prisoners. Let's go. There is nothing you can do, Roy. Let the sheriff take care of them. I have to go there. I want to know where the money is. They stole $ 35,000. Wait a minute. I want you to hear the reason. I'm just as angry as you are. We have law and order here and we will keep it. Forget the law! -They have a right to it and will have it. -What kind of law...? They stole $ 35,000. We go after the others with a possession. -Roy, about your father... -I know, Andy. Thanks for the feeling. What are you waiting for? -Let's collect a possession. -Squint, Tom, Caldwell. I need 8 to 10 men. Get your horses. -For what? -For what? For murder, theft. It is not enough? They killed Hanford and robbed the bank. -They didn't steal our money! - We don't want any more deaths. - They really escaped. -The bank was robbed. - It wasn't our money. -My man will not participate in this. We have four of them. I say to hang them! -Okay, hang the ones we arrest. - Mr. Boggs is dead. They killed him. I just found him. You killed my husband. Murderers. We will do our best, Mrs. Boggs. Does that change your mind? First Hanford, now Boggs. I want a possession. We'll get those killers. Come on, talk. -No one will go with you, sheriff. -You are a fool if you are. We would be ambushed. We wouldn't have a chance. You bunch of cowards. They killed my husband. Forget the others, let's take care of those here. If they are found guilty of justice, I will hang them. -You won't have to beg. -You are the elected sheriff of this city. You saw the money being stolen. He's always talking about the law. You have to at least try to get that money back. -Yes, you have to try. - It's your job as a sheriff. -Are you offering to come with me? -No, I won't risk my life. That's what you get paid for. I want that money. - I'm going with you, Meeker. -Roy. -Please honey. -Who else is coming? No one. And you, Andy? If my father were alive... He would go. You were his partner. Maybe it's your responsibility too. Perhaps your father was not, Roy. I know something. You know what? What you mean? That robbery came as no surprise to your father. What? Mr. Ferguson, don't say unpleasant things about the dead. The truth is one, Mrs. Boggs. When I looked out the bank window, I saw Charlie filling a bag of money. A black woman, her father filled her with money. If he did, it was because he was obliged. -Not from what I saw. -Andy, what are you trying to say? -He did it because he wanted to. -Andy. Your father has been deceiving me since yesterday. I hate to say it, Roy, but he agreed with the thieves. That's a low thing to say, Andy. You cannot prove what you say. I saw him handing over the money without even pointing a gun at him. Even the curtains were drawn. And that man slapped him in the back like an old friend. Have you ever seen a thief slapping back of the man he's stealing unless they worked together? You are lying. Stop lying. Why was your father so eager to take those men to the bank when did i offer to do this? There was a reason. If he were alive, he would kill you for saying that. I was afraid of that. Why did he change the combination of the safe without telling me? He said he forgot to let me know. This never happened before. He changed the combination why I wanted to go with those men to the bank instead of me. And so. So he sent me for the wedding party. He insisted that I go. Yesterday his father talked to him for 20 minutes. He told me about it, they just talked about business. We do talk about business, the kind that nobody hears. - I saw him leaving the bank yesterday. -Certainly. After I made the deal. -What agreement? -What you just saw. We both bet... And we lost. -What did I tell you? -He's a liar. -Are you going to believe in a thief? -Are you calling me a thief? -I'll tell you who a thief is. -Wait a minute. We will not lose our heads. Why not try them now? I serve on the jury. -Me too. -You will have a trial. Tom, send a message to the deputy telling him everything that happened. Ask him to come with a judge tomorrow. I will send the message immediately. -Does that satisfy you? -They are already arrested and would be happy to blame anyone, but we need to get the others -and we're wasting time. -Try to collect a possession. After you do that, get out of town, as you planned. Not now. I won't leave here until I cleared my father's name. I'm not going anywhere. The trial will be tomorrow. Now, get out. My poor and precious husband. I saw him handing the money over to them. This did not surprise me. Ferguson is talking like a fool, Roy. It's like a nightmare. First, my father being killed, -Now, this talk from Andy. -I'm glad you don't want to go, Roy. I don't want to go too. Not this way. That old man talking about Hanford being mixed up in it saves our necks. They cannot condemn us for murder now. Hanford was our partner. -Partner? -Sure. He was at it with us and took the risks. -It's the law. -IT IS? Yes, he died like a bank robber. And old Ferguson is our best witness. -What happened to that money? - Boggs got him. He said he was going to hide in one of the coffins. This is good for us too. Sooner or later the money will be buried. They will only condemn us to a few years for bank robbery. Okay, and if they condemn us to more than six years... Six years? -Yes, but we'll be back. -Sheriff! -Someone will end up getting hurt. -We want justice. I couldn't send the message, the wires were cut. Listen to me. Hear the reason. We were unable to send any messages out of town. Perhaps the others plan to rescue the four we have arrested. If they try, there could be more deaths. There is only one thing to do, take these men north. For a larger chain. Who's coming with me? The sheriff is right. I will ride with him. Wesley, Crawley, Mason, let's go with the sheriff. I need a dozen men. Sam, I'll leave you in charge of the city. We will be back in four days at the most. As soon as you deliver them. - You better give me the badge. -I'm going with you, Mekeer. No, Roy, you have things to do. It might be better to stay a month. We will send for you. Anyway, you don't want to be here with the city against you. -This can hurt your career. -Stay with Kathy. -I will go. -It's fair. Place the prisoners on the horses. Sheriff, you will get your possession. Most of them are calming down. Good. We'll be leaving soon. It is better to have someone repair the telegraph line. -Tom took 2 men to see this. -Good. Okay, let's go. You are only asking for more problems while staying on Gunsight Pass. Martin, you knew my father. You know he doesn't... I know one thing, like a father, like a son. You are not welcome in this city. Sam... If you want to leave the city, no one will stop you. -Sam, what are you saying? -I live here. Not you. Kathy, what's the matter with everyone? -Kathy... -I was wrong, Roy. -We shouldn't stay here. -I need. But they will never forgive or forget. I can't escape it. My father was not part of the theft. But you cannot prove it. Besides, they want us to leave. -No, go home, dear. -But, Roy, this is the day of -our marriage. - I'll talk to Andy now. You know that everything you said about my father is a lie, don't you? -Your father was a pagan man. -He feared God, a good man. And now you condemn him. Why? Of course, he doesn't believe what he says. -Answer me. -Your father was giving the money. They weren't taking care of him. And they didn't use force. Whitey could be pointing a gun at him. -No, I saw it clearly. -Nobody pointed out a -gun for him? -No one. I looked out the front window. I saw your father's face and he he knew what he was doing. He did it because he wanted to. I'm not a judge, Andy. But whoever judges this case -will destroy your distorted story. -Nothing you say will bring you back that money. It is a terrible loss. Not for you. I will pay every penny. -You do not have money. -I'll sell everything my father had, except his share in this bank. I will raise up to $ 12,000. And the rest I will pay with salary you earn here and with the bank's profit. -You won't be in this business. -Yes I'll do it. By law and my father's will, I am heir to your profits and losses. Even if it takes a lifetime, I'll pay all that stolen money back. And your father's name will come out of the two windows. His name will remain there and I will add mine. Settle, Andy. I will stay here for a long time. -Why do you trust so much, Kirk? -I'm just not sure. -He's not like that. -Need more -what to be sure? -Whitey and the rest were robbing the bank without us. We lost two horses, we were almost killed and don't you think he betrayed us? Have you lost your mind? You told Whitey to wait until we get there, to do nothing and stay away from problems. And cover us at the entrance and exit. -And he betrayed us. - Shut up. They thought they could rob the bank and run away... -I told you to shut up! -I can't shut up my thoughts. Whitey would not have the courage to betray me. Let's go to the city to rescue them. -Do not count on me. -You want the money, don't you? -He's there and we'll get him tonight. -They're waiting for us, Dirk. You don't know where the money is, they may have taken it from the bank -and placed elsewhere. - Boggs will know where he is. Dirk. -Who would say. -They are not riding -like chasing someone. -Look, they have Whitey and the others. All covered. -They're going a long way to hang them. -No, they could have them hanged in the city. It looks like the sheriff is taking them north to stand trial. Sheriffs usually respect the law when they are elected. With that possession, he thought that no one would attack them. Attack them? I thought we were after the money. Yes, with all these men out of town, it will be much easier. We're going to town, but first we'll free Whitey and the others. -Four of us against them all? - We're dead. Four men can assault a train with 100 passengers. We already did that, we can with them. We did it once in Grand Falls, you were not with me, but Whitey was. Worked well. I want you to stay behind them. When you enter that narrow passage, scare them. Make it look like an ambush. I'll be ahead and do the rest. Hold these prisoners. Let's go through this passage. Don't think about shooting. Does anyone else intend to cash out? Go ahead, try it. -Go to those rocks. -Mount the horses, come on! Dirk, the old Grand Falls trick. -You remember Grand Falls. -You do not need that. Not? Do you want me to kiss you? If you had done what I told you, we wouldn't have this problem. - Things got lost. -Of course yes. -With your help. -Can we get the sheriff out of the sun? You can place it wherever you want, it is dead. I had to change your orders. Boggs told me at the last minute who would take the money on the stage shortly after the wedding, at 12:30. You would arrive at 13:00. Don't you see that the only thing what we could do was steal the money before they left the city? I could have waited to attack the stagecoach. And face 100 people led by the sheriff? -They would kill us all. -Tell the truth, Whitey. They were trying to keep the money just for you, weren't they? You are crazy, Forrest. Do you believe him, Dirk? Why would I do that? Why would any of us do that? All these years we have been riding together. -You're trying to piss me off, Forrest. -He has a right to think that. Me too. I'll give you a chance. Here, release them. You don't have to be nervous. You have the money. -What? -The $ 35,000. Let's go to town and get him tonight. Okay said he was sure he was with you. I? Are you crazy? I left the bank with him, the money was in a purse. What makes you think I got it? You left the bank, what's up? -What happened to him? -They were shooting from all sides. I saw him walking down the street, so I left the bag where I could see it. I was caught in the alley, I couldn't go back to the bag. I thought you got it. The money is not in the city. They almost hanged us because they didn't find the money. -You knew we didn't get it. -How would we know, Dirk? Everyone in town thinks you got him. Okay, you don't have to believe me. - Ask the doctor. -You. Don't worry about him, doctor. What about bank money? -Didn't you get it? -No, I didn't get it. -I didn't lie to you, Dirk. -Someone in that city is with the money. Could Boggs have it? Boggs? What does he have with that? I didn't see Boggs. None of us saw him. He was killed while hiding at the funeral home. That's where they found the body, wasn't it, doctor? -He participated in this? -Just answer me. -Where did they find him? -In the funeral home. He's not with them, he's not with Boggs, he's not with us. Someone has the money and we are going to the city to find out who. Take their weapons. -We can't attack the city just us. -Why not? Most of their gunmen are here. -Not all of them. -You have no courage. Okay, but we won't surprise anyone. We'll see. Get the best horses. Let's go. No more mistakes. Bring the sheriff, let him be buried decently. I've always liked sheriffs. Especially, the dead. Come on. Ride your horses. Okay, walking. Ride your horses. -Hello, Squint. -Help me with this ladder and I'll buy you a drink. Let's wash the teeth. The truth is one, Mrs. Boggs. When I looked out the bank window, Charlie was filling the bag with money. -You just saw this bag? -A black one. Her father put all the money in it, $ 35,000. I will not pay for that window if it cannot withstand this storm. My windows are of quality. Put everyone in front of the saloon. Keep walking to the other side of the street. Let's go. Madam, you're not going anywhere. -What are you doing, boss? - Didn't you do enough? Shut up. Keep your hands up. Take their weapons. Put the weapons in the saddles. You don't want to be the sheriff. Look at what happens to them. I want the bank's $ 35,000. Who's with him? I thought you escaped with the money. No jokes. I said I want the money. Sam, no. Look, I'm not deceiving you. If you don’t have the money, -we don't know who you're with. -I'll give you half an hour to find it. And I'm not kidding. Okay, it's 16:30. Every half hour that I don’t have that money in my hands, I’ll kill one of the men. Frank. Every half hour someone will be shot until they give me the money. We wouldn't be here if we had the money. We are not insensitive. I will give a reward -to anyone who tells us where it is. -No one knows where the money is. -Who has the bank's money? -Let's wait half an hour to see. How about we drink something while we wait? I'm based from Kansas City. Okay, go get them some whiskey. Get them off those horses. Take them to the balcony, away from guns. Get the horses out of here. Look what I found, straight from St. Louis. Why doesn't anyone show up with the money when they know they'll be shot? We will have to kill many people. If they don't have the money, maybe they were with Boggs. Boggs may have seen Okay drop the bag, he may have taken it and gone back to his funeral home and hidden it. And then to have died, no? Isn't it worth checking? -Remove that funeral home. - You're wasting time. -Boggs wasn't even on the street. -That's right. Get her out of here. I didn't think Mr. Boggs had caught it. -Maybe yes. -Maybe not. You're ready to blame everyone, aren't you? -Where were you during the duel? -I? He went to the bank and saw everything through the window. That's what I meant. He must have seen that bag. -I didn't find her. -Who else wanted the money? -You found it and hid it. -I didn't take any money. You have accused your dead partner just to escape the guilt. You said yourself that Hanford was part of the scam. -He wasn't part of it. -And you blamed him anyway. I would say anything to get out of jail. -You dirty... -Stay right there. -So you killed Hanford. - Someone killed him. He died trying to save money. You caught him during the duel. -Where did you put it? -That's crazy. Wouldn't he put it back in the safe knowing that no one would look there? You are very smart, aren't you? No wonder nobody more in the city knows where it is. What do you think about opening the safe? -I can't open the safe. -What did I tell you? -One excuse after another. -Only Hanford knew the combination. -And you were partners? -He's telling the truth. We'll see. Let's go. You and he are friends now, huh? Do you know where the money is too? See, Dirk? I told you. It couldn't have been Boggs. We will open the safe for you. We will blow it up. -I'll take the horses out of the wind. -They are not being hurt. They will be blind. I will find a place for them. You, go back there. -Are you not there. -We'll shoot you first if not. Okay, back up. Come on, get out of here. Side door. Look over there. -Are you alright? -I am. -Why are you doing this for me? -Maybe it's to prove something. If we can get to the sheriff's office, there are guns there. -Can you shoot? -I think so. Let's go. They took them all. We need weapons. They are in the saddles of their horses. -Yes. -Roy, this can be our advantage. We can find those horses. -Andy. -I'll risk it by your side. And, Roy, I was very wrong about your father. Yes, you were. Now. Don't touch that. - I found her, Dirk. -Do not say. You have found. You knew where you were all along, didn't you? He thought of making me blow up the safe while taking the money. - I didn't think so, Dirk. - I know what you wanted, Whitey. -You would have run away. -Dirk, I found it. I just wanted to be sure before I tell you. You and I can share the money. We can escape during the storm. Leave others to rot. Just you and me. Whitey, I don't need you anymore. I won't even miss you. Empty! Did you see the boy and the old man? They fled. I saw nothing, just heard those shots. Let Dirk find them, I'm going blind. We have to get to the other side of the Boggs chapel. Whitey took the horses there. -The guns are there. -They'll come to us. We'll have to take a chance. Mrs. Boggs has the money. She's in the stable trying to - escape with him. -You guys, take the guns. Go with him. Wait. Mrs. Boggs, don't be silly. -Get out of here. -You can not do that. -Mrs. Boggs, give me that money. -No, you can't stop me now. Get out of here. Hey, the guns. We took your weapons. She died. Let's go. Hand over the money and I'll stop shooting. I have a lot of bullets. Okay, back up. It's all over. Get those bodies out of here. -We got the others. - Mrs. Boggs had the money. -She put the whole city in danger. - Even herself. People do all kinds of things, good and bad. Perhaps by using this I have made up for something. I think many of us have to apologize. I don't know where to start, Roy. I really do not know. Maybe we can start by picking up the broken pieces, Andy. - Come on, you four. -They'll miss me on the reservation. -You'll miss me in Mexico. -How will I spend my vacation - in the Canadian mountains? -Subam, you are lucky to be alive. Well, doctor, young people are going to have a nice trip. -Good bye, father. -Have a nice trip. -Thank you. -Be careful. - Write to us, do you hear? -I will write. Don't forget to look for my cousin in Washington. -It's all right. -She will show you the city. - See you, Squint. - Goodbye, Roy. - See you later, Andy. -Roy, you don't want to stay for me help manage the bank? Everyone wants it to stay. I'm sorry, Andy, but Kathy and I think it will be better this way. Besides, I never knew how to do it. See you guys. -Squint, how about a drink? -Doctor, we both need it. Let's go. Translation Editing and Synchronization by WesternKasa / GM NOV2020
