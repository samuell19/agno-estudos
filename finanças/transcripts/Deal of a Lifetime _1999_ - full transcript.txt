Just don't forget who your real friends are. How could I do that, huh? Come on. Give me five. Just a little bit.All right. Now, I've been working on some campaign slogans... Dudes! Hey, hey! What's up, fellas?What's up, man? How you doin', guy, huh? So, Henry, what's gonna be our campaign strategy? Well, uh, you know, I haven't thought it out that much, but foster was just... So here's how I see it. Piggy the doozer is clearly not a threat. "Piggy the doozer." Yeah, well... Piggy-- uh, Peggy-- is, you know, she's pretty smart. She could make a good president. Yeah, and since when does that have anything to do with it? Besides... Doozer... is a loser. [ Cackling laughter ] That's good!You like that? Doozer, a loser! Come here, baby. So now that the doozer's history, all we gotta do is scope out Johnson while you, Henry my boy, do your little... Charisma thing. Huh? Okay. All right. Um, now, you guys aren't gonna break any of the rules or anything, right? Rules? Unh. What rules? [ All chuckling ] [ Chuckling ] Good. Good. Good. [ Peggy gasps ] This is all your fault, you know. What?! You nominated me in the first place. Yeah, but that's because you're the best person for the job, Peggy. Yeah, well, as of now, I quit. You can't. Look, whoever did that stuff to your posters is gonna count on you giving up. Yeah, but who could have done something like this? I don't know. Listen, have you finished your speech yet? All I have so far is an outline. Toss it. I'm gonna write you a speech that's gonna knock their socks off. But aren't you working for Henry? Not anymore. [ Sighs ] A speech. A speech. Thy kingdom for that speech. Poor little Peggy. [ Laughter ] I am sogood. Party. Horny. Sexy. Tina, we've tried every 5-letter password I can think of. Maybe we're missing the obvious here. What if the password's really personal, like something that matters only to Jerry. Cruelty to small animals? Jerry matters most to Jerry. Try it! Aah! His agent's license. Incriminating office photographs. Oh, well, let's have a look. Huh! What's this? Ugh! [ Audibly reacts ] "My darling Jerry, I can't believe it. "After five years in this horrible place, "I'm finally gonna get out of here, thanks to you. "Please do not change your mind, "for I know you will truly love me "the moment my contract goes up in flames. "I shall never forget you for this. Veronica chaise." We got him! Who's Veronica chaise? He always said he destroyed her contract by accident. Jerry... in love. Now, there's a really scary picture. Not as scary as what'll happen if Bob finds out. [ Chuckles ] Tina... Is it...? What are you gonna do? Ohh. I don't know yet. I'll think of something. [ Sighs ] Bingo! Needs a little work. It'll do. Go, Henry, go! Go, Henry, go! [ Chanting continues ] Okay, listen up. Here's the play, here's the play. Uh, spooner, you gotta take the kickoff, all right? Warren, D.C., you guys gonna block that first line. Raymond, I want you to sit up that next wedge. And men, your job is to... [ General, enthusiastic shouting ] All right, let's go. Let's hit it, let's go. Hey, hey, hey, what's going on? Let's go! Jeez! Come on, let's move it out here! [ Indistinct cheers ] [ Growly voice ] Uh, hey, was that, uh, block on the first line, or, uh... uh... [ Normal voice ] You'll sign if you know what's good for you. I'm not gonna sign. It's your funeral. Careful, spooner. People get hurt playing football. Eat me, Johnson. [ Blows whistle ] Cheerleaders: Go, Henry, go! Go, Henry, go! Go, Henry, go! Go, Henry, go! Guys. Guy--! Say your prayers, ass wipe! [ Blows whistle ] Hey! Hey, hey! What's going on here? Get up, get up, get up! Everybody get up! Is he okay? What happened to you, son? What happened to your speed? Your momma can run faster than that! Are you all right, son?[ Groaning ] Oh, my god. Get up, son. Come on, we've got to play here. Get up. My arm. I can't move my arm. [ Laughing ] Oh, Henry, you poor thing. Does it hurt? Well, just a little bit.[ Girls tittering ] You're just being modest. It looked so dangerous out there. Yeah, it's a little. I mean, I-I don't really know that much about the game. In fact, I don't even really like it. [ Girls laughing ] You are so humble! Well, you know, I really have to go, so it was nice seeing all of you. Where do you think you're going? [ Girls tittering ] God, Laurie, I thought you were dating Henry. You are disgusting.We weren't just-- you know, whatever, Henry. Just drop dead, okay? Ow. Nothing is worth all this, foster. Shoulda thought about that before. What do you mean by that? Look, I don't know what your game is, Henry, but I don't want to be a part of it. How can you say that? This is me, Henry, your friend. Friends don't draw mustaches on other friends' girlfriends' pictures. I didn't do that.You know, suddenly... I see your posters everywhere, and somebody just happens to deface all of Kevin and Peggy's posters. How do you explain that? Maybe axe did it. Look... I had nothing to do with it, okay, and if my best friend doesn't believe in me, you know, there is a crowd of people out there that would love to take your place. Good. Because as of this minute, I'm working for Peggy doozer. Fine. Good. Yeah. What am I doing? [ Toilet flushes ] Jerry, what are you trying to do to me? I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, come on. I thought you said that you didn't hold grudges. Did I say that? Yes. I lied. Oh, I'm sorry, Henry. What I did was wrong. Just try to see it from my side, will you, babe? I was kind of hurt when you turned me down at first. Can't really blame a girl for trying to get a little revenge, can you? Oh, well. You've got it in spades. Yeah, in the past few days, I lost my best friend, my new girlfriend, nearly my life... And not to mention this whole naked-in-a-hallway thing. [ Chuckles ] Yes, well, this is serious, isn't it? Hm. Well, you know, I suppose there's really only one thing you can do to redeem yourself and get it all back. What's that? Judgment day, buddy boy. I can't believe this. You tricked me. I thought you said that you didn't care about the contract. You said that you just wanted to help me. I suppose I'd put on a grass skirt and do a Hawaiian mating dance if I thought it would work. I got other appointments. Sign, please. I guess it comes down to whether... Getting what I want is worth compromising everything I believe in, huh? That's right. And it is, for the record. Always. [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] Now then, because I like you so very much, as an added bonus, I'm gonna win you that election fair and square. I'm gonna write you a speech so fabulous, it'll have 'em standing in the aisles. What about Laurie? Do I get her back? Consider it done. Congratulations... Mr. President. [ Cheers and applause ]♪ [ Band playing ] All: Go, Henry! You, Kevin! Whoo! [ Cheers and applause ] ♪ [ Band playing ]All: Go, Henry! Okay, okay, people. Settle, settle, settle. This is the moment you've all been waiting for: The candidates' forum. [ Applause ] First, we're going to be hearing from Kevin Johnson on how he would improve the school if he is elected. Kevin? [ Cheers and applause ][ Indistinct shouts ] How you guys doin'? [ Applause subsides ] I'd like to start by listing off all the reasons why you should elect me president. First of all, I'm not bad to look at. Um... Okay, there's some other stuff here. I would vote to have a shorter school day. [ Cheers and applause ] Yeah, all right! And because of my intense involvement with the football team, I've seen what a winning season can do for the morale of the school. [ Scattered shouts of approval ] Okay. Um... What else here? I firmly believe that if we raise money for the football team, the school will benefit in a lot of-- a whole lot of different ways. Tha-- thanks a lot. Yeah![ Applause ] [ Polite applause ] Very revealing, Kevin. Read this. It's killer! Our next candidate is Henry spooner! [ Wild cheers and applause ] [ Cheers and applause continuing ] Whoo! Uh... I don't know if my ideas are gonna be quite as inspiring as Kevin's, but... [ Laughing ] I owe it to the little people to give it a shot. [ Murmuring ] Um... Okay. I believe that to make this a better school, we have to be exactly who we are. Uh... some of the candidates see US as coming from different junior highs, staying in our little cliques, but I don't think that's true. I think we're already together. I think we're already one junior class. I think we're already destined to do great things. [ Wild cheers and applause ] Let's face it-- this whole election is nothing more than a popularity contest. During my brief time at arcadia, I've known what it's like to be unpopular, to be made fun of, to know that no matter how hard you try, nothing you say is going to make a difference. [ Audience murmuring ] How could you do it, Henry? Uh... In fact, I've figured out that there are those of US who peak in high school... And those of US... [ Audience murmuring ] Problem? This is foster's speech. Hey, I changed a fewwords. All right, I gotta admit it: Little weasel can write.Foster's my best friend. I'm just good at bein' bad. It's what I do. You know, you told me that everything was gonna work out just fine. You said-- oh, no, no, no. I said I would make you president and give you popularity. Look out there at your fantasy babe. Give her a look right now. She's yours, and the presidency, and whatever else you want. What else do you want? What about foster?[ Hisses ] Yeah, well, some people you just can't buy. I don't think I can do this. Well, I think you're blowing it, but quite frankly, I don't really care. I held up my end of the bargain; the rest is pretty much up to you. By the way, thanks for your soul. When you get downstairs, anything you need-- promise me. I realize... That some people peak in high school and will risk anything to be popular, while others have the confidence to be true to themselves and know that popularity is never important enough... To... Betray... Betray friends. [ Audience murmuring ] [ Stage whisper ] Are you all right, Henry? No. What's the matter? This isn't my speech. He, uh... I mean... I stole this speech from foster and Peggy. [ Indistinct comments ] This is Peggy's speech. Poor guy. Oh, Tina. I'm back. [ Weeping softly ] Welcome back, jer. Thank you, Tina. It's nice to be back. The fresh air is wreaking havoc on my clothes. Aren't you going to ask me how it went? We watched. Great family viewing. Then you caught every single, shining, cinematic moment. I was so blindingly fast, so insanely fabulous. That little jerk didn't even know what hit him. The contract-- signed, sealed, almost delivered. What are you up to? I thought if I was gonna be stuck here, I might as well make it livable. Uh-huh. All right, then. One, I want that contract put in a safe place. Two, I want those clothes dry-cleaned and back here in 15 minutes. And three... Find something else unpleasant to do. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] Now what? Hey. Hey. Hey, Henry. Who are you? Where's Jerry? I'm Tina. I work for Jerry. It's not exactly a glowing reference, you know. I said I work for Jerry. I didn't say I like him. I want to help you, swear to god. You know... you're much better looking in person. Thanks. Why do you want to help me? After everything you've been through, kind of reminded me of me. [ Soft chuckle ] What do you really want, Henry? I want to be Henry spooner again. I want things to be the way they were before, you know? Having everything you want sucks. I want my best friend back, I want to get bad grades again, and I want a girl to like me because she really likes me, you know? That's all I want. Where you goin'? I have to get back. I-I thought you were gonna help me. I am. And thank you for helping me. [ Engine sputters and starts ] Jerry: What do I have to do to get a latte around here? Get it yourself, dirt bag! I'm sorry. Were you talking to moi? [ Chuckles ] Yeah! My, my, my. What an alarmingly moronic display of independence. Or perhaps the boiler room is starting to look good to you. No. But I do want my freedom, Jerry, and I'm willing to make a deal. Oh. You poor, dear, stupid child, in order to make a deal, one must have something with which to bargain. You, sadly, have nothing! Wrong again, you little weasel. As a matter of fact, I dohave something. A big something. Do tell. This is the evidence that will not only put you in the boiler room but will probably have you sharing a bunk bed with Hitler. Blackmail. While I admire the pathetic attempt at style, I must admit... I think you're bluffing. Bob won't think so. I think he'll find this particular document very informative. What are you talking about? Uh, does Veronica chaise ring a nasty little bell? Bob already knows about that. It was an accident. Yeah, I know that's what we told Bob, but is that the truth? You don't have anything to prove that it isn't. What were her exact words? "I will know you truly love me the moment my contract goes up in flames." [ Comical whimper ] That was... A delusional woman. Eh... You gotta be kidding. I mean, that letter's-- it's proof of nothing. [ Clicks tongue ] Such a shame when sex brings a good man down. Oh, no, mustn't touch.Give it to me! All I want is my freedom in exchange for this letter, Jerry. When hell freezes over. Aah! Sit! Now then, what did we learn from this morning's lesson, hmm? When you're going to blackmail your boss, you must always remember to keep the original. I have to remember that.[ Chuckles ] yes, you do. Now, then, you see that phone there? In a couple of minutes, it's going to ring. Brrring! It's gonna be Bob. Bob's gonna want the contract. I'm gonna put the contract on Bob's desk. Then, Bob's gonna want to know what he can do to make his favorite agent happy. I'll ask for the usual perks, of course: Bigger office, better view, competent, more voluptuous secretary, and then i'm going to request that you be transferred to purgatory! Auf wiedersehen! Heh. A rocket scientist you aren't. [ Exhales ] [ Knocks on door ] [ Growly roar ]Ahh! It's great to be back, sir. I-I heard, actually, that you had some work done. Was it implants or plugs, or what'd you--? Bob diablo: The contract, Jerry! Got it right here, sir. Absolutely. You know... [ Nervous chuckle ] It wasn't easy this particular time. You know, that kid may have looked like a big nothin', but he-- he was one crafty little son of a-- now,jerry. I got it right here, sir. I got thi-- what the--? What burned,jerry? You burned Henry's contract, you idiot! Get me the boiler room! [ Slot slams shut ] Aah! Hey, hey, hey! You look like something from jerk-inator ii! [ Giggles ]What? Wait a minute... You hate me. [ Scoffs ] Of course, dummy. What do you think? You hate me again. Yeah. Get outta here. Go!Mom! Get outta here! I am sorelieved that Mr. Shakespeare is already deceased, because the results of this quiz would surely have killed him. Only one person in this class managed to get a perfect score. Congratulations... Mr. Johnson. All right! Kevin! You rock! You... You, uh, you did it. You, uh... You're very... You're very smart. And, uh, i'm-- I'm very happy for you. Hey, thanks, man.
