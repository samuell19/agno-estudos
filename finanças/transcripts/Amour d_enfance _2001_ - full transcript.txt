Childhood Love Paul! Jean-Marie? I wouldn't have recognized you. You see all that? Well everything here, is me. All this is me. All of that. All of that. Of course when I say it's me, I didn't do it personally... but it was me who made it happen. Things change fast, obviously. Only seasons don't change... winter... spring... summer... autumn. It’s monotonous. Forgive me for not stopping... but I really don't have the time now, Just not possible. OK I'll drop by sometime. You’ll tell them, right? OK? Hulloo! Anybody home? Mum! Yoo-hoo! You see, he's come. He's here. So speak to him... Say something to him. It's nice of you to have come, Paul. Answer him, Paul! You’re welcome Dad, of course Don't you have any questions to ask him? His exams. I was told you passed your exams, right? Yes? Yes I did. We're happy you're succeeding Paul. You'll succeed, right? Of course I shall, Dad, yes. Come in! Pardon me. It's silly. What is? Pardon me. - Herbal tea? - Yes, herbal tea. Alright. You want another pillow? - Don’t trouble yourself. - No trouble at all. Well, anyway... Did you say something, Auguste? No, no, nothing. Speak louder... can't hear a thing. Studying so long... Isn't he sick of it? I told you already. Do I have to repeat myself? He’s almost finished. He’s almost finished, yeah, I know. Mum, you got some clothes for me? So I can get dirty. Look through your father's things in the workshop. Are you going to come and say hello? Hi Auguste... How are you? Looking so much like his father, right Odette? Especially in those clothes. What do you want for lunch? Well, I was going up to see the sick man. You don't mind, Odette? Go ahead, Auguste. You never bother. I've breaded fish in the freezer. Fine for you? Really looking like his father. Mum... What can I do? What do you want to do? Is there nothing needs doing? No... I manage. Get some rest. Well... Can I unleash the dog? Watch out for the dog. Don't let him run free. Hey, but that’s Odile! Hey, but that’s Paul! You're a big girl now... No one told me. A big girl? I’m a woman, Paul. Yeah, I can see that's true. You haven't seen my dog, have you? Your dog? No. Like some help? Where's this one from? The kid. He's mine. Yours? You're my baby, aren't you? Well! Well! No, he's Brigitte's unfortunately. Your sister's? She here? No, she leaves them with me for the holidays. Paul! Odile, is that Paul? Yes, it's him. Oh Paul, it's nice of you to have come to see us. You OK, Paul? Yes... and you? Like a coffee? Odile, invite Paul to have coffee. Yes, alright. Coming? - No I... - To see Brigitte. Hey! - Thierry? - Hi! - Hi! - What are you doing here? And you? This yours?! How did you afford this? A loan, what do you think? Odile! You can bang on it, it's solid. Odile! What? Go out tonight? Where to? Wherever... The Nirvana? - Not tonight. - Tomorrow? Yeah, maybe. You're such a pain! What? Stop it, you're the pain. We're not married. But you told me you'd come… Hop in! Hey, Odile...! - What? - A kiss at least. Come on! Be quick then. Someone to kiss here? We did a lot of stupid things together. Stupid things together. You and I. Yeah... Especially you. Yeah... especially me. We'll do the hunt opening. What? The hunt opening. Opening. We'll see. Yeah. Mum...! Will it take long? Mum. Will it take long? I'm doing housework. Oh, you're there... Can I take a quick look? Did you open my gift? Yes. Do you like it? Yes. It's a beautiful book. Will you read it? Books really aren't my thing. But it's about agriculture. Olivier de Serres was Henri IV's head farmer. You read it? No Only leafed through it. Looked interesting. Thought you might be interested too. You know I never liked reading that much. Don't get me wrong. Never had the time for it. Now you got time, you could use it. That must be the nurse Mum, the nurse's here. Hey... You're not broke, are you? All good. Hey Paul, perfect timing... Can you drive me to the market? I was told told your sister was here. Come on take me... you've nothing better to do. Is Brigitte here? Yes, she came yesterday to get the kids. Was in a rush. Said to say hi. Two minutes. Wait there. But where is she? At her place. Where's that? At her boyfriend's in Drome. In Drome?! What the hell is she doing there? Did you find your dog? Why didn’t you and Brigitte stay together? I don't get it. Why no one ever wants to tell me, I’m fed up! No one ever wants to tell me shit. Anyway, the men she went with after you, were all zeros. Really? Yeah... Losers. Me, you see... I was really sad when you guys broke up. I even cried, I remember. - You think that's silly, right? - Not at all. Brigitte used to say you were in love with me. No, really? She said that? What a bitch! That’s disgusting!! That makes me feel so ashamed! Your parents aren’t here? No. - Where are they? - Out at sea. Where abouts? Does that really interest you? What was it called, what your mum used to make? What? Sort of milk. "Chicken milk". Yeah, chicken milk. It was awful. She still makes it... The poor woman. Honestly, how do you like my dress? Not that ugly right? No, not bad at all. It will do? Yes, it’ll do. It'll be fine. Shit, my crepe! Hungry? Yes. How long do you think he’s got left? They must’ve some idea about it. How long? Can be a month, a year. As he's not in hospital... More like a month or a year? I don't know Paul. I don't know. Of course if you must go back…go. Not eating? I ate already. Sit down at least. Here, some cheese? Sit down! Chew properly. Forgive me, Paul... I've cried so much. When it's over, I don't think I could cry anymore. You’ll give me your dirty laundry? No, it's fine. Before you leave... ...it'd be better washed. Has this wine been here for a long time? It’s been here. But has it been long? You're just not used to it. Mum... What's happening? What did I say? Nothing... it'll pass. What’s the matter, Mum? Because he's going to die... But never mind... I'm over it... see. I can stay... ...a few more days... Do as you please, Paul. Hey, you need to walk a bit. I walk. If you want to get better, you have to walk... ...a bit every day. What are you saying? Not me. That's what the doctor says. You believe the doctor? He's our doctor. He’s our doctor, so we believe him! Yes, why shouldn't we? You think I don't know, Paul? You think I’m a moron? If I pretend, it's for your mother. And she also pretends. Why say something unpleasant like that? Cut it out! If I wasn't already done for, would you be here? Isn't that why she told you to come? Well... I was coming anyway. This is still home for me. Stop your bullshit! No, it's true, you right. I came because they told me you were going to die. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come, it's true. You want me to go? What's going on here? Did you fight again, you two? No, it's nothing. It’s nothing Paul! Yeah? Paul! I'm up here. Paul! Yeah? Odile? Yeah. Come up! Come down! You want to go to the market? I can’t just now. But what are you doing? Having fun? I can’t leave it like this. Look, everything’s falling apart. Wait... What? 62, raise your arms... It's Mum... she's depressed. She's in a knitting phase. Don't upset her. That's all. Thanks - sorry to bother you. Odile...! What? You know... I think you and Thierry are a good match. No, really. Well... nice! I wanted to ask you... Yeah? Why don't you two get married? What for? Well, I don’t know, aren’t you in love? Well... yeah, maybe. Apart from getting married... ...what about kids? Don’t you like kids? I'd have kids. For real, what are you waiting for? I don't know... Haven't thought about it. When you think too little about things, you end up not doing them. Yes, maybe, you’re right... But, you know, market is only until noon. Talk about it with Thierry. Damn, where the hell is it? You find it? Here. Dead or wounded? You got it. Sorry... I don't really know... how to use it. Do you have film at least? Well, yes... It's a new camera. It worked OK? Let me see it, c’mon! - You know how to use it? - Yes. I wanted to buy the same model. Great! Super pro! Here... take it. - That's OK. - What's OK? It's OK. Keep it. I'm giving it to you. - Giving it? - Yes, giving it. You're giving it to me? For me? You're giving it to me? Why, Paul? You don't use it? No, it makes me happy. It's odd... I didn't ask for anything. Strange, isn't it? It's a gift, Thierry, that's all. No... Keep it, Paul, I can’t accept it. It’s a gift... A gift is a gift. One doesn’t give gifts just like that. But it makes me happy to do it. Well, I don’t know... What do you want in exchange? Anything you want? Nothing. It's for free, Thierry! I don't like it, Paul! It's strange... besides being for free. You're up. Yes. Why are you staying up? Well, I’ll let you work then. Don’t you have anything else to do? Well, yes, but… So, what’s up? It bothers me... Don't you have things to attend to? Did you call at your job? Don’t you have anything better to do? What’s with you? It bothers me. Look at me... Look at me! I’m looking at you. What? Smile at me! Don't make me laugh. Smile... for one second. What happened to your teeth? Don't you need to go to the dentist? Don’t you think I've better things to do? Listen, I'd like to help... ...being useful. I'm here and I'm willing. But I find nothing to do. Mum told me you started to de-stone the Bosc field. True? Oh, you've got the Phillips-head. What did you want to do with it? Why remove the stones? Well, I can't help. Can't do anything for you. Maybe there's something. Tell me...! I swear if I can do something, I’ll do it. You got a cigarette? It'd do me good. Hey, Paul...! Come and have a drink, come on! Come on! Say hi to Aime, you remember Aime? Yeah, Aime... The son of... His parents were cousins. Rich people don’t share. And here's the result. Eh Aime? And Suzette... Remember Suzette? Hi Paul. We can say that Suzette used to be pretty. I used to be beautifull! - Pepe not at City Hall? - To do the show? Guys like him should be subsidized. Listen to these old geezers! So, you're gonna sell? Why do you say that? How will you make a living? You're not gonna hire anyone. And the loans... what'll you do about the loans? There are a lot of things can be done with your land. I happen to have money just now, that I don't know what do with. Don't listen to him, Paul! Don’t let him get the better of you! That's is what is called the silent majority. It’d be nice if the silent majority could keep quiet. Listen to him, ha ha! Oh, Paul... How are you going? Back already? We weren't far away. I’m torn between these two colors. What do you think? This one? No, I think I like the other one better. Miss, do you have one with stripes? Do you have any news from Brigitte? Yes, she remembers you well, you know. She always asks about you. She even says she doesn’t want to see you again, to preserve the good image. Do you have it in the other direction, like this? I'll check. Mum! Here comes my little minx. Look! You coming with me to the haberdashery? Er... no. But you'll help me choose! No, I'm sick and tired of balls of yarn. Paul just finished... right Paul? You're not being nice! You're not being nice! Take the bags at least! You seem pretty gloomy. What? Well, Paul, don’t let it get you down. You’re charming, Odile, you know? I get that... ...from my sister. No? Don't think so? Could be. Sure you don’t want to come in? No thanks. You know, Odile... Sometimes I have the feeling... ...that I missed... That I went searching for something that actually... ...right here, close by. Sure you won't come in? I'm sure. Well... Too bad. Come on, think about it! I already thought about it. Who'd be interested in it, eh? Maybe the Englishman. We need to keep the house. Where would my mother live otherwise? What about you? Does it interest you? Me? What would I do with it? I'm good as I am. I never worked... I’m not about to start now. Plus, there’s an organized trip to the Caribbean, for old folks. I need to enjoy myself. However, if you need turkeys, I’ll sell you some. Even the cattle doesn’t interest you? Listen... I’m sorry to disappoint you... But I got a good job... with plenty of free time. It’s a gamble... You could merge the two properties and maybe later, when... Are you crazy?! You’re nuts! You make me laugh... Look around... It’s not like we lack land. You never know... you might need it later. Oh, come on, Paul! That’s over. Slavery’s over now. We’re free now! Yeah, we’re free. But, Thierry, what will I do with it now? Well, you should work it, you’ll see. Get off! Get off... The boss’s coming! You coming on Saturday? Yeah. I’ll pick you up. Aime! Hey, Aime! Aime, you’re rich? You have money? Would you like to buy some land? Land is beautiful. Hey, I’m talking to you! Get out of there! You’ll get dirty. Come on! Sorry, huh. I didn’t know what I was doing You’re alright? What’s the matter? You lost something? These little stones here? That’s what you lost? These little stones... They what you’re looking for? They're seashells. Why do things change, Aime? Why isn’t it like it used to be? Why isn’t everything like it used to be? But the local team, confusing speed with accuracy, Has he eaten? missed the mark in the first half. Where was it? Is he eating? His throat hurts! Paul... His throat hurts! Make him eat... He needs to eat! Yes! …so that at halftime the black and blues hadn't take advantage of their territorial domination. Won't you eat a bit? They won? You sure you won’t eat a tiny bit? Paul... No... I’m really sorry, I won’t be able to be there. I know, I know, but I really can’t. Listen, I’m not irreplaceable, proctors can be found. You’ll be able to find someone. They’re not hard to find, Good morning. Hang on... Mum, it’s Mrs Daguineau. Tell her it's Brigitte. Who? The nurse. Tell her to come up! Yes. Listen... My father is dying and I need to replace him. Understand? Well, I don’t care, I really don’t care! You talking to me? You're not going to make it, either. Watch. See. Good training for you, eh? What about your hands? Aren’t your hands hurting? Hey, what the hell are you doing? You coming? To do what? It’s Saturday... Come on, we’ll get wasted! I’d like to make some progress here. Paul, come on, what’s the matter? Besides, it's dark... It's night-time. It's night-time. Do you know what we lack around here? We’re not alluring enough... Alluring! Oh, you coming? I’m coming. He’s coming! You know what we oughta do? Listen, I came here to have fun. I came to have fun too. I’m with my friends. I’m also with my friends... Can’t we have fun together? Excuse me! Are we going to stay here like this? That’s not cool. There are things to do with your place. There are things to do. A holiday village, for example. You see? Bungalows, playgrounds... Swimming pools. Of course, now I’m dreaming... But in a few years.... ...you’ll see. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Come on! Come on! Paul ! Where are you going? Wait for me! Wait! You know what I used to call you when I was little? Well? No, I won’t tell you. Come on! Come on, come on, quickly! Get down! Sorry, I’m feeling affectionate and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. - What did you used to call me? - No! What did you call me? No... Prince Charming! Prince Charming, I used to call you. Wait, let me… Odile...! You there? Odile? I’m hiding! Whereabouts? Here! Where? Come on! What for? Come on, I have a gift for you. Thierry, I really can’t accept it. I’m giving it to you and that’s that. A gift is a gift. You're crazy... ruining yourself like this. Fuck... I would’ve liked a rifle like that. Don’t hold it like that! Don’t hold it like that, it’s dangerous. Just shoot me while you’re at it. Well, go on! Don’t be shy! What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? You really disappoint me, Paul. If you only knew how much you disappoint me. My esteem for you's gone down. Really. I thought you were smart. I know I'm not. I thought at least you were. Why don’t you choose another one? Why take our women? Don’t have enough? So we're enemies now. Couldn’t we've stayed friends? Isn’t being friends important? Yeah, don’t answer, you fucking moron. Above all, don't answer! Come on, say something! Better we split eh? Before it ends bad. What are you doing? What’s the matter? Why did you shoot? Why? Why'd you shoot? It’s my dog. We need to take him to the vet, quickly. Come on. He needs to be put down. Can you do it? Please. Hurry up, he’s suffering! Hurry up, the poor thing! Please, hurry up! Undo the safety, goddammit! No, there, on the side. Please don’t die, don’t die. There were a lot of people. Odette! Wait for me. Please excuse him, he really couldn’t come. Sorry. We throw this away? Put it with the wood... You never know. With the wood. We got a card from Auguste. What’s he up to? He seems good. And this, we throw away? It’ll smell. Keep it? Throw it away. Take a look around. It’s a nice kitchen bench. And there’s a power point here. It’s useful. You think the dinner service would fit in? Well, We’re fed up with all those old things. And there are neighbours, too. What about the traffic noise? It’ll keep me company. When are you leaving? Later today. You got some news of Thierry? Yeah, he’s got a new dog. Ah, he has a new dog. Yeah, same breed. Ah, the same. Give him my regards. If I see him. You’ll tell him that… I’ll drop by sometime. You’ll tell him? Fine. Brigitte’s here. Want me to call her? No... thank you, no. Sorry, I lied... She’s not here. Odile... are you coming to help? Odile! I'm coming! Your shirt by the way... Don’t you want it? Well, yeah, take it! I’ll go get it. Don't move... Wait for me. Can you clean up the table? Paul? Paul! Paul! Paul!
