Everyone's at the fair. Matus said there'd be ropewalkers there, too. Bulina! Bulina, where you been wandering! You'd better watch out! Nice body you've got. But you'd better not flounce around like that, or you'll end up like the goat. It was so proud. Showing off like it had a pot of gold. And then the bandit showed up and snatched her up. Better not show off. Whoa, Bujak, get off! The bull wouldn't hurt us, would it? Nah, it's just a calf. Coming from Vysna? There's a fair there today. Lad, could you drive those cows over to the tank? A little closer, you know? Could you? - Go on. - Okay. Hey-ya, hey-ya! Could you move over that way a bit? A bit more, there you go. Now look at me. I knew right away you were going to Lysa. All the tourists do. That's the way to the world's end. - What's up there? - The Sovus Mountains. But there's nothing beyond. I'll climb them one day when I'm a farmhand. Which grade are you in? None. I'm a shepherd, gotta herd cows. You do that every day? Even on Sundays? Long as the grass is green. In winter, I chop wood. Or pluck out feathers. Your dad is strict, huh? I don't have one, I'm with grandpa. - And your mom... - Katerina, but she's not home. She's a servant over at Potocky's. I'll go there myself when I grow up. Here you go, it's falling through my fingers. Thank you. Wonderful. Am I in the picture, too? The old bugger. Hiding them around. Hey-ya! Any eggs? One for you. One for me. Oh jeez... - Gotta get the soup. - Go ahead. Better put your egg in the basket. I met some tourists. They gave me some money, look. Should I give it to mommy? Hmm, buy yourself something, since you've missed the fair. And you know what? I'll start going to school. Says who, the tourists? They said I should. The mayor won't let you. You're a shepherd, after all. And then, it's all the way in Vysna. Imagine plodding through the snow in winter. A wolf might catch you. Or the crows would nab you up and take you somewhere far off. To some poor sucker's doorstep. You'd be worse off, boy. But I wish I could read. You'll learn what you need anyhow. Without any letters. The Lord gave you fingers to count with. Look, so many of 'em. The Devil's worse off, he's only got hooves. He can't count nothing. But I'll be a farmhand! That you will. - Darn, I'm off. - Bye now. They're having cabbage soup at the mayor's today. - I'm here for the soup, Mara. - What's that to me? Nothing I can do. Wait 'till the mistress comes back from Vysna. You still here? Whoa! Take that in. What do you want? Did Mara not give you soup? She said to wait for you. Go fetch some wood. I will. There was a magician at the fair. He put some rocks in a bag and then shook out gold. That's the King of Dwarves. He had a rabbit, too. And there were swings. - I heard they look like boats. - They're white, all metal. - Did you go on the swings? - You curious cat! She did and she danced, too. With these crippled legs of hers. Then she walked the rope with her crutches. Want me to punch your lights out, asshole? Up to my ears in work. Work? They're already waiting for you at the pub, fucker. They'll be taking me to the doctor's. The old woman gave me some herbs. But that was good for nothing. You should have asked the magician at the fair. - Some can heal. - Not that one. But he had water that changed colors. You know what else he had? What, a crystal ball? A pigeon. He put it under his hat. And when he took the hat off, the pigeon was gone. - Hi Katka. Is daddy home? - Yeah, we just got back. - At Salajka, you say? - Yeah, by the barn. - A landmine? - I've just told you. Sit down. Get the brandy, Mara. Katka! Go get changed. Old Gzela, the German shepherd, found it. What's that to me? Put it there, under the oven. I didn't put it there. Why everyone always comes to me? You're the mayor, after all. We gotta report it in Vysna. And get the cops. Yeah, I'll send Lojzek. Dammit, I wonder when they'll get all that crap out of the woods. Been two years since the war ended. Well, the war ended, but it didn't. For fuck's sake, Jozin, don't get all spiritual on me. 'It ended, but it didn't' What kind of crap is that? There's not just landmines in the woods, there's soldiers, too. The Insurgent Army. I just hope there won't be any trouble. Why so scared, Jozin? And why are you so calm? You'd talk different if you lived all by yourself like me. A week ago, they burned down a village at Polana. You heard about that, didn't you? Come now, Polana is way over yonder. You might as well say they're all the way over in Poland. But they're here as well, mind you. They wanna fight their way to Austria. Have you seen any? Not really. Then you'd better shut your trap. I don't believe in any insurgents. - What do you say? - Thank you, ma'am. After all, I heard nothing from the county, either. Is Katerina in the barn? Is she? Mommy? Mommy? Were you asleep, mommy? Mommy? Look, I've got some money. You can buy a skirt with it, a short one like the tourist had. They were going to Lysa. And I'll be in a picture, too. The tourists promised it to me. And Bublina will be in there, too. They also gave me something once. A scarf or a necklace... I don't remember, it's gone. Why aren't you milking?! Did the cow give much milk? Five. Five liters. At this time of summer? Whoever heard of such a thing? Pops would flog you like a dog, if he were alive. And all because you tend the cows so badly. But, but... I take good care of 'em. The master's right, you're full of it. You always screw up! You just stuff your face and wander 'round. Just you wait, bastard, I'll get you one day and make you regret the day you were born. Where did you come from? Go home, go on, or master Potocky will beat you like a dog. I saw something in the shrubs. They had eyes like saucers. Maybe bears? They were silent. Maybe the Noonwitch? The noonwitch is never silent. And she walks alone. What was it then? Bandits, what else. One used to wander around here before he got caught. They hung him on a hook down in the valley. That was a long time ago. Mmm, cabbage soup. Well, who knows. That's not Potocky's dog. I often think I could use one myself. Dogs are alright. I can barely see a thing anymore. It could take me wherever I need. So you think you can pass through here and get all the way over there, huh? Not all of us. We expecting... expect casualties. I'd leave that to them, mayor, they know their way around. We're here to secure their way. You see? There's good people like you everywhere. Christians. But you can only stay 'till the morning. Not a moment longer. We got here at night, we'll leave at night. You, as the mayor, must get the people to fall in line. Make sure they help us when we pass through. And, most importantly, not report anything to the cops or the authorities. You'll paint a sign at the houses of those we can rely on. For what? Like this. For safety's sake. I see. Looting. Nobody will enter a house with the sign. But we need food, old clothes, some money and those... stamps. Ration stamps. We're a poor village, nothing but rocks. I won't give you anything. Don't be a miser. You'll give what you have. They'll come back one day and chase the antichrist away. And you know what else? You don't, grandpa. I do. They found something at Salajka. Treasure. Oh no. A bandmine, or something. Do you have any idea what it could be? A trap. For a hare or a bear. Made from iron. But there are no more bears or mines. The foxes ate them up. When a silly rabbit walks into a trap, the foxes get mad because they have nothing to eat. But the gamekeeper said there was one by the barn. And you know who found it? Gzela, would you believe it? It's possible that they'd missed one. Even the Cunning Little Vixen would miss it? Ah, she's got different things to worry about. She's not just a fox, she walks in high boots. The King of Dwarves goes to her for advice every now and then. About who to punish and who to reward. Like that little girl that shared a potato pancake with him? He was very hungry then. And just made a quick stop. - Then again, a king never goes hungry. - He was testing her. When he gave her a bag of rocks, he was also testing her. To see if she'd throw the rocks in the ditch? That's right. She took 'em all home like she was supposed to. And as soon as she opened the bag, it glittered gold. You know the story already. But you haven't met the dwarf and we've got nothing. Well, he's busy. He can't be testing everybody. You know how many people there are in the world? Some of them black, even. Not everyone can get their turn. Uncle! I was worried you might be asleep already. - Here I am, old fellow. - I can see that. What brings you here this late at night? Uncle! Is it something about Katerina? What do you mean? No, I was at the fair and brought something for the little boy. Here you go. - So hot out there. - Storm's a-comin'. I don't think so, the sky is clear. But plenty of spiders are comin' out. Uncle, it's a T-shirt. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Grandpa, look. Look what a nice T-shirt I have. The fabric seems good. But I'm not sure about the color. What do you mean? It's like the rainbow. - Right, Uncle? - Right, you are. Rainbow... you should buy me a new set of eyes. And one more thing. Even Katka doesn't have anything like this. Nor Matus neither. - What if the master takes it? - Potocky? He yelled at me, said I'm a bad shepherd. Don't worry, he won't. What about the mayor? He won't either. Uncle's nice, ain't he? Aren't you also a king of dwarves? You're too big to be a king of dwarves. - He forgot the Turkish delight. - He'll be back. Some sweet tooth he's got. What made you think of him, Cyril? I did more than my fair share of shepherding when I was his age. You remember, don't you? Sometimes we had cows, sometimes we didn't. But the meadows are still the same. And there'd be a fair every now and then. Look, my dear water. What a nice T-shirt I have. Dammit, they won't stop eating, the beasts. Even the cows didn't recognize me today. You're herding by the tank? Even Ladena looked at me as if I were a stranger. And Bujak, too. It's about to start raining cats and dogs. Let's go, guys. - Hurry up! - You got that at the fair, huh? I bought one for our little boy, too. The very same one? Drive the cows to the forest! Move it! Hurry! Ladena, my poor Ladena. What will I do now? [unintelligible] My good ol' Ladena. Smart monkey you are. I bet you knew the tree would get hit and led the little ones away. Where are you getting your soup today, at the Chab's? Here, at the pub. Have you seen the doctor? I'm going tomorrow. They will shoot electricity down my legs. I wouldn't let anyone do that to me. The shock will knock you out. The Cunning Little Vixen could help you. Nah, she can't do nothing. She's got the water of life, you know. She's got it from the raven. It can bring the dead to life. But you'd need a hen. We've got tons of hens. You've messed it all up! You know what? If you see the Vixen, tell her to come. She doesn't come around here much. The King of Dwarves keeps her at home, in that underground palace of theirs. They count gold coins. And then they play bowling. They were playing today as well. How [unintelligible] when they hit the tree! - What signs? - On the doors. Some have 'em, some don't. Like so. Let me tell you something, guys. Leave signs to the old crone, the sextoness, and other such witches. I'm the mayor here. I am. Go to hell, idiots. There's always something. First you imagine insurgents, now some signs, but... - Get a hold of yourself, guys. - But the signs are there, Mayor. - And so are the soldiers. - So what? Should I be shitting my pants? You think they got shits for brains? That they would crawl into a village crowded with people, so they get caught like a bunch of sheep? They'd have to be real dumb. They'll sneak into the woods and stay quiet as mice. - And what will they eat? Branches? - And they'll need money. What would they eat branches for? They can shoot a deer. There's plenty of those in the woods, isn't there? Yeah, and in the village there's even more sheep, cows, and plenty else. You think they want to loot? We've barely got over the war and now this. - There's always something. - I think it's more like nothing. Here you are... [incoherent dialect] All of them corrupt. And you wonder why. These county bigwigs are only good to be made into hamburger meat. - But you'd have to add a lot of garlic. - Mustard! Now tell me who put them there. And we still have empty stomachs and empty pockets. Ration stamps... - And shit to get for them. - Shit to get for them. They were elected by the people. You're also here because we elected you. Indeed. I was in office before the war, throughout, and I'm the mayor here still. For 15 friggin' years I've been carrying it all on my shoulders. Since I'm here, nobody's had to beg. Not one person with an empty stomach. Not even today. Can you hear me, you... Can you hear me? Dammit, I'll show you. Get over here. Need a hand? Now tell us. - Are you hungry? - I am. He is. You're hungry? Yes, just now. I'm not asking about now, I mean in general. I get soup. And berries for Christmas, mittens, even fish. - I also get milk. - Yes, milk as well. Don't tell us you're hungry, then. Here you are, take it somewhere. Wait, give him some more. And some mustard. A bit of sausage. There's more, give it. Here you are. He can eat like a horse. The way he tends sheep, he shouldn't get anything. He won't starve but he's not doing too well. And what would the noble lord have us do? Serve him hot chocolate? I'm not talking about food. What kind of life does the boy have? He herds all day long, then chops wood, mows fields, scrubs floors. In winter, he drags bags of feed into the woods, and all that for a bit of milk and old shoes. Vysna, he's only heard about. He doesn't know what a cinema is. Things like merry-go-rounds and swings he only knows from others' tales. And the worst thing... You know what's the worst, Mayor? Do I? The worst thing is we've got nothing to drink. Innkeeper! That was well-spoken, Cyril. Like Churchill, and at length! Tell me, then, what's the worst? All year long, you won't let the boy go to school, keeping him dumb as a doorknob. But hooray, he tends the entire village's cattle. Cut it out, Cyril. Who's supposed to herd then? My Katka? The poor little cripple? You may be sorry later. There's a law against this. But you know how to keep one quiet with sausage and bacon. Stop it! Stop it and go to hell! I didn't go to school either. I learned what I needed on my own. I can even sign my name. Maybe an X. That was good enough when you were his age, Potocky. But it's different now. Cyril's right. It could be trouble, Mayor. And who would tell? You? What if I did? That's what Jozin and I are on the board for. And that's why we have the county and the school board. Amen. Alright, let him go to school then. But only in winter. Whoa! Not for these two. Mommy. Are your legs hot? You won't be able to see your reflection. The water's too wild here. I'll take you some place else, okay? Look who I brought, my dear water. Did you hear, mommy? I will be going to school, in winter. In winter... The school's in Vysna. You'd freeze to death. I'll learn to read. And read for you. Grandpa's got a calendar. Have you ever had mustard? It's yellow. The mayor gave it to me. He was yelling at me because I was hungry. Potocky was also screeching. Go home. Don't sit here, the water would carry you away. It wants people. She might be under a spell. Like a princess? Perhaps. She milks cows, rakes manure, picks peas. She shakes herself awake. Once every thousand years. Who put her under the spell? A wizard? - Or the Noonwitch? - A magic fairy. An evil one. Some are good. You have one like that. You're always smiling, eyes wide, happy as a lark. You have a very good fairy. If I had a bag of gold, I'd bring mommy to me. And I'd buy her a mattress of hay. That would be something. And for you I'd buy... guess what. A dog and some wine, every Sunday. Or brandy? I wish you had the gold already. That's the way of the world. Tomorrow I'm going to sell baskets. Sit down. As soon as I see the King of Dwarves, I'll give him bread and he'll reward me. - And if you don't see him? - Then I'll call for him. The mean merchantwoman also called for him and he appeared. - He can be summoned. - But it ain't that easy. Is it difficult to learn the magic word? The things you'd need are the problem. Where would you get them? You'd need a table, elbow-high, from linden wood, and a stool to go along with it. Is that okay? And I'd need a tablecloth. One from white linen, sown with a golden thread. And then... two little dishes, two silver spoons, and a crystal glass, the King wouldn't drink from any other. Then some wine, a lump of butter, honey. - And a hen. - A live one? A speckled one. The table must be made in a green meadow, as soon as the dew dries up. You must tear the hen apart in half, and collect the blood into a cup. It's terrible about the hen. Even the mean merchantwoman tore her apart? Can't be helped. Some people would even kill another person for gold. That's that. You'd have to do all that. Then they might come. - The King doesn't come alone? - He's got a scribe. And he goes everywhere with him. A scribe? To write down what needs to be written. Lest something be forgotten. And does the King wear a crown? Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. Sometimes he wears a cloak. And so does the scribe. He's got a green cap, a coat as brown as the ground that hides treasures. Summoning dwarves is not so easy. I want to do it for mommy. And they could help Katka, too. I really need that dog. I can still see the Moon... but... not a single star. And now go to sleep. I'll go see Barak with the baskets in the morning. He'll give me bacon in exchange. Oh boy, I really need that dog. So many things are needed. Where could I get them all? It's going to pour. See them clouds crawling along. What are you doing chasing her? She pecked me, bitch. - What's with the sack? - In case it rains. It will. You could get some mushrooms. I could make soup from them. I will. Did you bring any bacon? Go on, Hnapak, don't get in the way. The honey would stop up your snout and the lard would make you shit. Are you a dog? Don't dawdle here and go join the other cows. I'll summon the King. Get lost! Are you hungry, Your Majesty? Have some bacon. And I have... some Turkish delight. Grandpa didn't have any wine. I brought what I could. I can't build a linden table. Or a stool. And I couldn't get a speckled hen. Grandpa only has white ones. Help yourself, Mr. Scribe. It's smoked with blackthorn wood. - Why do you think I'm a scribe? - I recognized you right away. The King of Dwarves always comes with a scribe. And he's the king? Are there any soldiers in the village? Or the police? Not now. They've gone? Long time ago? Where to? They left when the shooting stopped. A long time ago. They left some tanks here. There's still one that burnt out. Are the cows sick? They don't move at all. They'll get up when I drive them. They'd be drinking, but there's no water here. Is that water of life in that bottle? Water of life? You bet. Have some. I don't need it. But Katka could use some. Have some yourself! You can't tell anyone you saw us. Not at home, not to the mayor, not to a living soul. - Not a word. - Not a word, I swear. It's the king's orders. And then I'll get the treasure? You should have a look at the calf, it looks sick. Go on! And don't look back! They ate everything and gave me nothing. They didn't want the bacon, only the hen. Get up, come on. Did a snake bite you? The treasure. That's why they told me to have a look at the calf. My reward, at last. How do I open this? There's something here. Grandpa will think of something. No, not grandpa, uncle will. Austria-made. How it glitters. That's proper material. I bought five of them. He's driving them back already? Didn't you say he was gonna go to school? You did. You, get over here! You hear me, come here! What is it you're carrying? I found something, so I picked it up. Jesus Christ... it's a landmine. Don't move! Don't drop it! Dammit, you'll blow us all up. - What do we do now? - Kill the little fucker. Katerina! What are you calling her for? We've got one idiot here already. Stay where you are! And listen carefully! Turn around slowly. Not that way! No! Turn around, dammit! Toward the meadow. Serves the fucker right. That's good. And now go straight ahead. Go ahead, but slowly. Slowly! Slowly, idiot. Be careful not to move, or it will be the end of you. And don't stop! Go on, go! No! Fucking cloth! Fuck that, don't pick it up! Stop! Go back! Whoa! What's the matter? Not you, you go straight ahead, into the meadow! He's got a landmine! A landmine? Where the fuck did he get it? How should I know? It's a good thing a cow didn't step on it. - Or him. - I wish he did. Don't turn around, retard! Go into the meadow, go! Who knows what it is. It could just be a box or something. - A can, perhaps. - I can tell a mine from a can, asshole. - I wonder it hasn't gone off already. - Stop! Listen carefully. Put it down slowly. Put it down, but slowly. Right where you are. Put it down, but slowly! - A dud, huh? - Go to hell! Move it! Get a move on! Get some of those grass dryers. He's the last person we needed. Move it, for god's sake! And now you'll place these around that thing. Like a fence, got it? Turn around. And I'll put a warning sign there later. - Go on! - I'll help him. Leave him alone, it's all his doing. You should be proud of yourself, mayor. What's pride got to do with it? You'd have him march up to his backyard with that arsenal? Or let him bring it into the village? You need a specialist to disarm that. It could have killed him. It could have killed him back in the meadow or wherever he picked it up. You should thank your guardian angel. I've torn my T-shirt, Uncle. - Don't mind that. - It's all torn up. Put those in yourself! Ram's tongue is the best remedy, I should know. Alright, hold this. I'll fix your T-shirt. Well... Well, I would... Now. I can't weave a thread through a needle. Mommy! Potocky sent you, right? You came to give me a spanking. I came to... I forgot already. You came home, that's what people do. Even cats and dogs do. Flies, too. Do you want soup? Have some. It's good. They said you were born again. So was the mayor's calf, it was lying on the mine. I only got a scratch. But the T-shirt... Have a look. I'll warm it up for you. Get me a needle and some white thread. I'd give you bacon. I had some this morning. A whole rack. Dwarves ate it all up. God be with you. There's soldiers in the village. Give me a swig. Insurgents? Hell no, ours. Take one. Let me open it for you. - Is there a lot of 'em? - Plenty. I wouldn't want to feed them. I don't know what to make of it. - Is now the time to be talking? - Fuck off. And they want to set up camp here? I'm not letting anyone in. To hell with them all. Come on, there's soldiers here! Of course, we'll give you ration stamps. We may have a sausage or two. But with so many mouths to feed... You have some bread, don't you? Barely enough for us. We just bake what we can eat. - You have beer, don't you? - Pops! Pops, how are we on beer? People get bottled beer during harvest. I've got no kegs. Not until the evening. Bottled will do. Is it cool at least? I told you there's none. Dammit. - Look, Venca, the Noonwitch. - Yeah, right. Go to hell with that noise. Get home! Well, lads, out on manoeuvres? No, sir, just a trip. The hills, the woods, fresh air. I thought you could help us with the harvest. - I'm the village mayor. - The local committee president? - No... Well, yes. - Great, I need your help. - Lodging? - Bread. We have some cans already. Some beer would be nice. Innkeeper! Innkeeper, don't you have any beer? I thought I'd start serving once people came back from the fields. Don't get smart and start serving. And tell your wife to heat up some water. For the lads to clean up, they look like bandits. Well, did you guys come down here from the ridge? Hunting down insurgents, right? Mr. president, you should call a public meeting. I need to talk with the people. It's harvest time, I know. In the evening. - Where are you going? - To the meeting, over there. You'd better go home to mommy, or the witch will take you. I say, let them. If they want to go to Austria or wherever, let them. So you'd be happy to give them anything they may need. Food, clothes, shoes. Money and wish them bon voyage. What would you have us do? Should we chase them out with pitchforks? You took the guns we got from Germans right after the war. We mainly want information. It's not just about the large armed units. Sometimes they pop up in twos or threes, in plain clothes. Perhaps they've been here without your knowing. So you'd have us ask every daytripper that comes by if he's an insurgent? No, I don't think so. Nobody has seen anything or anyone suspicious. - Or have they? - The boy did. He met them while herding in the hills. They gave him the landmine. What are you yapping about, crazy bitch? She's dumber than a sack of rocks. That boy is hers. But he doesn't know where his dad is, does he? Come over here. - Go on. - Don't be afraid, come on. Who did you see? Tell him, he won't bite. Dwarves came to see me. There you have it, he's seen dwarves. - Two of them, in the meadow up high. - And a dragon came, too? - Or a flaming pig? Or a ghost? - You said there were two? No more? The king and the scribe. But the king... - What about the king? - Dammit, Cyril, get a hold of yourself. Do you want us to listen to fairy tales? - We're in a meeting. - It's no skin off your back. Let him finish. What about that king? Did he want something? He couldn't speak the human language. But the scribe did. Did they have any weapons? Rifles? Two. And they shared their food. You gave them bread? And some bacon. They ate everything, even unripe apples. Well, we've got something after all, huh? Doesn't sound like a fairy tale to me. I just know he's dumb as a rock. A retard! He sees a dwarf in every branch. Innkeeper, some more beer. For them as well. You get your ass over to the cows. Sneaking in here and running her mouth. What you make of these fairy tales, I'll leave up to you. That's your concern. We've got plenty of our own. It's harvest time, I've got grain to bag and bread to bake. That's what we're here for, to ensure you can harvest in peace and quiet. Off we go! There should be a bus line through here. And one day we could set up a cinema. - What do you think? - How about a caf? while you're at it. Or a cabaret, huh? More beer? What are you staring at? Beer for you? Yeah, I'll have some. Or maybe I'd better have liqueur now that we'll have a cabaret. It would be nice to have a proper new pub in place of this hole. Aren't you ashamed? Look at yourself, you pig. Go to hell, you sanctimonious swine! Motherfucker! What does the mayor have against fairy tales? He got mad at uncle for telling one. He doesn't like them. If the mayor came across a vixen, he would shoot at it. And so would Potocky. What a beauty you are. Do you know what a cinema is? We'll have one, too. But it will be a long time from now. Only the kids will live to see it. No, you can't! You can't! That's the mayor's calf! Stop! Ladena! Let him go! There he is. He's back. What took him so long? Where's that boy of yours? I'll break the bastard's legs. - Fucking pathetic swine. - What's gotten into you? The cows have all come back, but there's no trace of the calves. I got all of mine. Must be that one calf got away and he's off looking for it. - Ladena came back as well? - Ladena? Yes, she did. A calf won't leave its mother's side just like that. You're one to talk. What's the matter? Get in, please! I gotta get back. Make a stop here. Doctor will be here in the morning. Don't sit here, the water would carry you away. It wants people. Are you no longer under a spell? No way! No! No way! In the meadow. - I'll lay the boy down in a meadow. - Let it go, old man. No, I won't have him with the dead. I want birds to be with him forever. And foxes and hares. Perhaps... a deer or a doe. And dwarves and fairies to light his way. At least he wouldn't feel sad. What are you on about, old man? You're not burying the boy. He wanted to find treasure. To buy a dog for me. A dog that could guide me. That's what I'm on about! It's not that bad, but I'll take him with me just in case. I've got something for you, old man, to cheer you up. He'll be better off in a hospital. How is he? I'm the mayor here. He'll recover, won't he? He surely will, but I'm not sure about you. What do you mean, not sure? What did he mean? I'm the one that lost a calf, aren't I? Someone will pay for that, dammit! Give it up already. He wanted to buy a dog for me. Oh well. Give it to me. Come on. I'll bring you soup in the evening.
