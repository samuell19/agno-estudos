He says be discreet. - I'd like you all to meet a good mate of mine from over the other side of the Pennines.

No. Let's drink to us. The bloody lot of us. all: The bloody lot of us. - We'll keep this brief. John here has acquired offices for us in the center of Manchester. He's got the printing and distribution end sewn up nicely. - Got a few Vice connections too. - It's coming together. Controlled vice. Off the streets. Out of the shop windows and into our pockets. The whole of the North of England, the girls, the shops, the mags, the whole bloody lot. We've got an opportunity here, an opportunity to invest the money from our little venture and turn it into something even bigger, something great. You all know the construction magnate, John Dawson. John, please join us. - Gentlemen. - Mr. Dawson has his own dreams. Don't you, John? - I do, Bill. I'm offering you a business opportunity, gentlemen. With your help, I'm going to build a leisure and shopping complex... and I'm not talking about some fucking rabbit hutch like Merrion Centre. I'm talking about the biggest of its kind in Europe... a place where you can buy everything you need, where you can go and see a film or go bowling, where you can have breakfast, lunch, or tea all under one roof. I'm talking about an investment of £100 million. There's land close by the Hunslet and Beeston exit of the M1. It'd be ideal. - We're gonna make this happen, gents, and we're gonna make some bloody money too, some fucking real bloody money. To us all. And to the North. all: To the North. - To the North, where we do what we want. [glasses clink] - At approximately 4:00 p.m. yesterday evening, Hazel Atkins disappeared on her way home from Morley Grange Junior and Infants. Hazel is ten years old. She has medium-length, light brown hair in plaits and brown eyes. She was wearing light blue jeans, a dark green top, and she was carrying a yellow bag embroidered with an H. Hazel was last seen walking up Rooms Lane towards her home in Bradstock Gardens. When Hazel did not return from school, Mr. and Mrs. Atkins contacted Morley Police, and a search was launched early yesterday evening. As some of you are aware, the police was joined in the search by more than 100 local people. Now, given the inclement weather and the fact that Hazel has never gone missing before, we're obviously concerned about her safety and her whereabouts. Now, Mr. Atkins would like to read a short statement in the hope that any member of the public who may have information regarding Hazel's whereabouts or disappearance will come forward and share this information. Thank you. - I'd like to appeal to anybody who knows where our Hazel is to please telephone the police. Please. If you know anything at all, please telephone the police. Please. Let her come home. We miss her. - I put Ellis out in the fields, Evans is in and out with the press, and Jim's taking the parents back to Morley. - The evening papers mention Clare Kemplay. - What do they say? - Nine years ago, same school, goes missing, turns up dead in the foundations of a new estate. - Usual bollocks, then. Talking of which... Angus-Angus wants us to go see a medium. - A what? - Mandy Wymer. Mystic fucking Mandy. She contacted Kath Tyler at the Post. Angus reckons it's worth a shot. - Come on, let's get back to Morley. - ♪ Tomorrow ♪ ♪ you're going to miss me ♪ ♪ 'cause I'll be gone ♪ ♪ Oh, but before I leave, baby ♪ ♪ still gonna live alone ♪ ♪ You're going to miss me ♪ ♪ You're going to miss me ♪ ♪ 'cause I'll be gone ♪ ♪ You're gonna miss me ♪ - There you go, Mum.

[upbeat soul music] ♪ ♪ - ♪ Closer ♪ ♪ Mmmmmm ♪ ♪ Closer ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ A little closer ♪ - Hi, there. John Piggott here to see Michael Myshkin. I'm his solicitor. - Visits are limited to 45 minutes. You must both remain seated throughout the course of the visit. You must have no physical contact. No passage of goods, ciggies, whatever. - What's he like, then, Myshkin? - Pervert, same as the rest. - Violent? - Only with his right hand. - Hello. - Hello. - My name's John Piggott. I used to live in Fitzwilliam near you. I'm a solicitor now, and your mother asked me to come and talk to you about an appeal. Now, an appeal's a very lengthy and costly procedure that involves a lot of time, a lot of different people. So before any firm embarks on such a course on behalf of a client, we have to ensure that there are sufficient grounds for such an appeal and that there's a great likelihood of success. Now, even that costs a lot of money. Do you, uh... do you understand what I'm saying? How long have you been in here, Michael? - Long time. - And you know why you're in this place? Tell me why you're in here. - Because of Clare. - Clare who? - Clare Kemplay. - All right. What about her? - She did get killed, and they said it were me. - Who said? - Everyone. - Did you kill Clare? - No. - Why did you say you did, then? Michael, why did you say you killed Clare? - They said I had to. - Who said? - Everyone. - Who's everyone? - The policemen, the solicitor. - Why would they tell you to do that? - I don't know. I told them who did. - You know who killed Clare Kemplay? Who? If it wasn't you, Michael, who was it? Who? - It was the Wolf. - The Wolf? - [snickering] The Wolf. The Wolf! The Wolf! [laughs] [Imitates wolf howling] - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. All good children go to heaven. Penny on the water, twopence on the sea, threepence on the railway, and out goes she. - Good luck, young man. Mind how you go. - [coughs] [spits] [zipper closing] - Cheers. - This is bollocks. - Hello, love. Dick Alderman. This is Maurice Jobson. - I know Mr. Jobson. [doorbell rings] - Is there anybody there? - Kathryn Tyler, Mrs. Wymer. - Yes. Come in. - Very nice. It's very Bohemian. - Please sit down. - Miss Tyler here says you've got some information about this little girl that's gone missing up Morley way. - Yes. - What type of information? - You must be getting desperate. - We're following up every possible lead. - I contacted the police once before, a long time ago. I never heard back. - It's different now. - I'm a medium. Sometimes I can hear, feel, see things other people can't. Sometimes the dead speak through me. - So you think she's dead, do you? Hmm? Hazel? - Shall we find out? Right. Put your hands on the table. It's okay. Let's see what we can find. It's happened before, three times. It's happening again now. Under the grass that grows beneath the stones and cracks. Beneath those beautiful carpets. Underground. The Rat and the Wolf are here. And the Pig. There's a swan too. The swan is dead. Help me. Help me. Please, tell them about the others. Please. - What are you fucking talking about? What others? - The others beneath those beautiful carpets. You've got to tell them where they are. - Do you think she knows aught about the 2:30 at York? Bollocks, Maurice, like you said. - Where's all of Clare Kemplay's stuff, Dick? The files, you know? - Maurice, it's a coincidence. What else could it be? - Where's the fucking stuff, Dick? - I don't know. Wood Street, probably. - Let's go. - What, now? - Yeah, now. - All the things BJ seen and all the things BJ done all those fucking, fucking things. - This is Detective Superintendent Jobson. - Pleasure. - Mr. Dunford hopes to be the Post's new crime correspondent. - Well, I always got on well with Jack Whitehead. - Good old Jack, eh? - He'll be standing in for a trial period. - Gentlemen, we'll keep this brief. At about 4:00 p.m. yesterday evening, 3rd of September, Clare Kemplay disappeared on her way home from Morley Grange Junior and Infants. Clare is ten years old. She was wearing a red top, grey school uniform, and Wellington boots. When Clare left school, she was carrying... - Okay. Lad found her. He works on the site. - What's your name, son? - Leonard. - Leonard Cole. Builder's mate. - Well, we're gonna need a statement from you, Leonard, all right? - I'm taking him down now. - Where's Bill? - Over there. - Okay. - He dumped her in a hurry. Maybe he was surprised. Facial abrasions, possibly bites. Words razored into her chest. "4 LUV." He tried to stitch fucking swan wings onto her, Maurice. - Christ. - Fancy a fuck, fatty? Tenner back at hers. - Tenner? [knocks on door] - Mr. Piggott saw Michael on Saturday. - You will help him, then? - Well, as I told you, I don't have very much experience with appeals. Certainly not this kind. You see, what should have happened with Michael's case is, his original solicitor should have lodged an appeal at his trial within 14 days. - Mr. McGuiness told him he must plead guilty. - Mr. Clive McGuiness? - Michael's solicitor. - It's very difficult to appeal against a confession and a guilty plea. - Some days I think me brain will explode. - I'm sorry. I'd really like to help you. I would, but... I just don't think I'm the right man for the job. I mean, to be frank, I don't see what the grounds are, other than Michael's changed his mind. - But he didn't do it. - He confessed. So you see, you'd basically be appealing against hisself. - Mr. McGuiness gave him bad advice. - Yeah. And he doesn't need any more. So I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be of any use. - I remember your father. I can remember him with you and your mates playing football on that field over there across the road. Next to Reverend Laws and her. And now it's happening again. That poor lass. Never stops. Not round here. But you know that, love, don't you? - I'm sorry, Mrs. Myshkin. Best you find somebody else. - Do you remember her? Wings. "4 LUV." - I heard you were sniffing around. - There are similarities. - It's just a coincidence, isn't it, Maurice? We got the bastard, didn't we? - Maybe he had help. - He'd have said so back then. - Back then, he said he didn't do it. Maurice, he coughed for the lot, didn't he? Clare Kemplay, Jeanette Garland, the Ridyard girl, right back to '69. Myshkin is where he belongs, where you put him. - I know Myshkin's got nothing to do with Hazel Atkins. I'd just like to talk to him. - All right. All right, maybe he did have help. Maybe there was some pervert, a fan, a copycat thing. Go and talk to him. And keep it out of the papers. And take Dick Alderman with you. And, Maurice? You know he did those things. You know it in your heart. - Michael. Do you remember us? I'm Mr. Jobson, and this is Mr. Alderman. We're policemen, yeah? - How are you, Michael? - Hands flat on the table! - There's no need for that, Michael, eh? We just want to ask you a few questions, that's all. We'll be gone before you know it. You just tell us what we want. It's all right. Hey. It's okay. Been in here a while now, eh? Must miss home. I know I would. Family, your mates, Fitzwilliam, eh? You and your mum and dad, wasn't it? Dad were a miner, weren't he? Passed away. - Because of dust. - Yeah. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, but, I bet your mum's keeping your old room for you, keeping it all just the way it was. Does she come and visit you, does she, eh, your mum? - Yes. - Good. And how about your mates? Do they come, do they? Hmm? 'Cause you had some mates at work, didn't you? That photo studio in Castleford. Who was your mate there, Michael? [whispers] Dick. - Michael? Who was your friend at the photo studio? What about Leonard? Never hear of him? - Leonard? - Yeah, Leonard Cole. How's he doing? He never comes? Never writes? - No. - No. Christmas card? - No. - You two were best mates, I heard. - Yes. - Thick as thieves. That's not very nice, is it? Some bloody mate he turned out to be, eh? Fucking hell. - It's a while since we saw Leonard Cole. We should bring him in. - Okay, boss. - Mr. Jobson? You know he had a meeting with his solicitor on Saturday? - What, going to appeal, is he? - He said a policeman told him to say he did it. - Did he say which policeman? - The solicitor headed him off. - Smart man. - And what was his name? - Piggott. John Winston Piggott. - Thanks for that. - Pleasure. - Piggott? - Yeah, John Piggott. A right fat bastard. His father was one of us.

Yes. - Why? - You were on that case, weren't you? I remember you. You had that boy put away for it. - For Clare and for two others, yeah. - Clare spoke to me. - What, in a séance? - She begged for help. She-she said, "We are in hell." - We? - The others. I saw her. I saw the blood. I saw the wings. - What else? - Words. "4 LUV." I saw her. I saw the blood. - He tried to stitch fucking swan wings onto her, Maurice. - That poor lass, Clare. After what they say happened to her, I couldn't live with meself. I'd been away, like. She were driving. - She? - The boss' wife. - Naughty boy. What was the car? - MG Sports. - Color? - Red. Red one. It were dead icy, and we were mucking around, you know. I'd had more to drink than her, like. Anyway, we were just coming past, and this white van comes out of nowhere. - You know Clare Kemplay was found round here? - The wife said. - So what'd you do then? - She'd done something to her neck, and she was a bit hysterical, like. I went over to the van to see if the driver were okay. He were a bit stunned. She wanted to drive on. Worried we might get found out. - So you got a good look at him? - Oh, aye. I recognized him. - Look at this place. I give it ten years. It will be fit for naught but dogs. They should burn it down. - Number seven. A priest. - Wouldn't be the first time, would it? No church I know of, mind. Didn't Arthur Piggott live round here? - Yeah, next door. - We're looking for Mr. Laws, love. - Haven't you done enough? We don't know anything about that Morley lass. - Where is he? - Up at the allotment, top of the field, end shed. - Watch yourself. - Should have brought a bloody picnic. - Can I help you, gentlemen? - Mr. Laws? - Uh-huh. - I'm DCS Molloy. This is DS Jobson. - I take it it's about the Morley lass. - What about her? - Our Leonard. You've found out something. - It's you we want to talk to this time, Mr. Laws... down at Morley station. Do you think Hazel is still alive? - I can't tell. She's on the edge. - This is bullshit. - That boy's innocent. You know he is. [knocking on door] [knocking continues] - He didn't do it. - Mrs. Cole, you really should have telephoned to make an appointment. My diary's pretty busy right now. - You took on that woman's pervert son. - I'm not representing Michael Myshkin, if that's what you're referring to, Mrs. Cole. - Mary! - He remembers us, Mary. You remember us, don't you, John? - Of course I remember. - He had nothing to do with her or this new one. - He has got a solicitor, hasn't he? - They gave us some guy from Bradford. - He's telling our Leonard to confess, but the lad's done nothing. - Clive McGuiness. - McGuiness? - He's his father's double, isn't he, Mary? - It's us, John. It's us. - Right. Same time tomorrow. - Hello, there. Here to see Leonard Cole. - And you are? - John Piggott. I'm Mr. Cole's solicitor. - Oh, is that right? It appears Mr. Cole already has a solicitor, and it isn't you. - That'd be the duty solicitor, Mr. McGuiness. Mr. Cole has dispensed of his services and now has his own representation. - And is there anything written or signed by Mr. Cole releasing Mr. McGuiness from his role? - That is why I'm here. - Yeah, but it isn't signed. - Of course it's not bloody signed. That's why I'm asking to see him, so he can sign it. - And you're not bloody listening, Mr. Piggott. You're not his solicitor, so you can't see him. - Can I use that telephone? - No, you can't. - Will you let his mother see him? - Yeah, if she was here by 6:00. Better get your skates on.

What's happened? - He's dead. Hung himself. - Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God bless Leonard's soul. Amen. - Hello. - I were Leonard's girlfriend. - I was almost his solicitor. What's your name? - Tessa. - Fancy a quick jump, Tessa? - Piss off. - All right, see you later. - What have you got in them? - Lunch.

Police went on about a white Ford Transit, Gypsies, the usual. But again, trail went cold, never found. - You think they're connected, Jeanette and Clare? - Eddie thought so. - Somebody must have an address for him, surely? - Eddie's dead.

You know who I mean? - Yes, Mr. Piggott, I know who you mean. - Well, I'm in the process of preparing a preliminary appeal on his behalf. - Didn't he plead guilty? - Diminished responsibility. - Well, then. - One might argue that his pleas were ill-considered, even that the confession itself might have been gained by unlawful means. - That's a very serious allegation, Mr. Piggott. - Just examples, possible avenues to explore. As I say, I'm feeling somewhat overfaced. - Oh, no, I think you have the measure of things. - No, no, no, not at all, no. I just need to be a little bit clearer about everything before I spend any more of my client's money. - What, and you want me to tell you? - I'd like you to tell me if Michael Myshkin murdered Clare Kemplay. - Yes, he did. - Alone? - Boss, urgent. It's Rochdale. - If you'd like to wait downstairs, I'll make sure you get his things. - Think about this, Mr. Jobson. I don't think Myshkin killed Clare, and I don't think Leonard Cole took Hazel Atkins, and I don't think he killed himself. - Good-bye, Mr. Piggott. - Policemen told you to say you killed Clare. But you didn't kill her? But you signed a piece of paper to say you did. - They said if I didn't, I'd never see me mum again. - The police said that? Your first solicitor, Mr. McGuiness, did you tell Mr. McGuiness that you didn't kill Clare? And what did he say? - He said it was too late. He said it would make things worse for me. - Do you remember Leonard Cole? - He were me best friend. - Michael, did Leonard kill Clare? - No. - Who did, then? - Leonard knows. - Leonard's dead, Michael. - It's not my fault.

He used to tease him, try and make him go with lasses. It were fucking cruel. But Michael wasn't bothered. He wasn't interested. He only had eyes for one girl. He used to talk about her all the time. - You're lying. - He had a photo. He used to talk to it... for hours. - Fuck off. Did you ever actually see them together? Did you? - He used to say he could save her. - Save her. Save Clare, what do you mean? - Not Clare, Jeanette.

I wish you'd have come to us before, Bill. - How's that, then, John? - Could've saved lots of bother. - How do you mean? - Reverend Laws was with me all that day. Family do. He were here with me. - You should've told us sooner, John. - It's bollocks. Fucking bollocks. - Got no reason to hold him now. - It's fucking bollocks, and you know it. - Finished? Have you fucking finished, Maurice? We fucking owe John Dawson. John Dawson is king, and don't you forget it. We have a positive sighting of a white Ford Transit. There's a vehicle of a similar description at that Gypo camp up at Hunslet. We'll hit them tonight. I'll ring around. Make it midnight. Okay, Maurice? Maurice? - Yeah. Is Eddie there? Dunford? I thought you were a fucking journalist. Well, you'd best start asking questions. You don't need to know. Are you interested in the Romany Way? White vans and Gypos. Hunslet-Beeston exit off the M1. Mischief Night came early, and you're late. [distant screams] - Eddie Dunford's being a bloody nuisance. - Dunford doesn't know anything. - He knows enough. He's not in your pocket or anyone else's. - Isn’t John Dawson the real problem? - How's that, Maurice? - Putting his private pleasures before business. - Before our business. - Dawson has been warned. - Dick's right. Our business. Two little problems. Not so much. - I've got Bob Craven and Dougie onto it. - Thank you, Bill. Make it nice and clean. Good. Solved. Our investment's secure. What we've planned, what we've all worked so hard for, it'll not get thrown away. I won't let that happen. To the North, where we do what we want. - To us all, and to the North. - To the North. - The North. - The North, where we do what we want. [laughter] - Bloody oasis, isn't it, Maurice? We've seen some things, haven't we? In five years' time, the game will be over. We'll leave it to the new lot, put our feet up, meet up from time to time in a place like this, talk about the old days, the good old, bad old days. The lab report came back from Rochdale. Chicken bones. Bloody chicken bones. You and your psychic girlfriend. - Can I see the report? - There's a reason you never made it over Bill, Maurice. You ever wonder about that? Probably the same reason your wife up and left with the kids. You're a whiner. Tipping off Dunford that time. Thought I didn't know? You cunt. You and your guilty fucking conscience, Maurice. - What about Hazel? - Hazel Atkins is dead. Leonard Cole killed her. You know that in your heart. Now, fuck off and retire quietly. - Mr. Myshkin has been refusing his food. He's also taken to smearing excrement on the walls of his room. Both staff and his family feel he might possibly attempt to take his own life. Michael. You've got a visitor. I'll be outside. Ten minutes. - Michael. I want you to tell me about Jeanette Garland. Michael, please. Look, I've tried to help you. I still want to help you. You knew her, didn't you? You had Jeanette's photo, didn't you? You carried it with you everywhere. You talked to it. - I used to see her sometimes. The others laughed, but she didn't. - When did you last see her? - That day. - Where? - Castleford. - Where in Castleford? - In a van. She wasn't smiling. She wasn't waving. I loved her. - Who was she with, Michael? Who took her? - You know. - I want you to tell me. - You know! Everybody knows. Everybody! I saw. I watched. The Wolf made me. - Michael... who is he? - Your dad were there too. Your dad were the Wolf's friend. - Dad. [wind whooshing] [hinge squeaking] [door bangs] [pigeons cooing] [bird wings fluttering] [grunting] - I see it at night. I see it all the time. It won't go away. I told you. I told you a long time ago. I could have saved them. I could have. - It's not your fault, Michael. It's not your fault. - I told you. I did, didn't I? - Yeah. Yeah, you did. - I told. And you said for me not to say. You said. - I said if you told them, that you would never see your mum again, didn't I? I said if you told them, you'd spend the rest of your life in prison. - You did. - And I said for you to say that you killed Clare and Susan and Jeanette. - [sobbing] - And I'm sorry, Michael. I'm so sorry. - This is for you. For all the things you made me do. For all the things you made me see. For voices in my head and silence of night. For the boy I was and boys that saw. For every little kid you fucked and all their dads who liked to watch. Your tongue in my mouth and your lies in my ear. Loving you, loving me. This is where it ends. It ends here. - This is BJ. [floorboards creaking] - I'm going to teach you how to love me. Hello, BJ. Ah, poor boy. I tried to look after you. I tried to protect you. Put it down. [gun cocks] Put it down, BJ. It doesn't suit you. Good boy. Let it go. I'm going to teach you how to love me. Do you remember? You were the first. You were the best. [rocks crumbling] [water dripping] Mr. Piggott is king today. You be nice to Mr. Piggott. The sea is the way, thy path is through the great waters, thy footsteps unknown. You stand at the door with the keys to death and hell. [electric drill whirring] [gunshot] - [grunts] [gun cocks] [laughs] There you are. You haven't the guts. [gunshot] [groans] [gun cocks] The seas all blood; the waters, wormwood. [gunshot] - Hazel? ♪ Twinkle, twinkle ♪ ♪ little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder ♪ ♪ what you are ♪ - Here is one that got away and lived to tell the tale, from Karachi Social Club and Griffin Hotel, Wakefield nick and St. Mary's Hostel, motorways and car parks, parks and toilets, idle rich and unemployed.
