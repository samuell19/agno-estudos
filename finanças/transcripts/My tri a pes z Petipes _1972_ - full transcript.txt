Where I'm going on holiday this year. I'm going on holiday to the Tatras. I'm going to Balaton. Bulgaria. Grandpa's cottage Italy. India, to hunt sharks. Auntie's cottage. Everyone works independently. Clear? Clear. It's all about practice. Please, Comrade teacher, please. Comrade teacher. We Three and the Dog from Fivedogs When will you start? Plenty of time. I can do it in ten minutes. Even the sea? What about you? No good? Please. He is not going anywhere this year. Tonda, go wash up and don't fool around. Dad will be here soon. I'm not hungry. Just don't let anything worse happen to you. So you see. Where's our third to the table? - I'm not eating. I heard the weather's supposed to be nice. Please, don't torture him. Jarek Ludvik... He's going on an internship over the holidays. So I thought... Tonda could be living in Jarek's room. Dad, were you talking about me? How many Tondas do we have at home? I'm going on holiday after all? Hooray, I'm going on holiday after all. on holiday, on holiday. To where? To Fivedogs. - Hooray. Is there a river? - There is, the Berounka Are the boys there? - Where they aren't. Are there fish? Tons. Mom? - What? - I'm so hungry. What are you doing? You have to train. Especially when you have to fish in unknown water. You never know in the Berounka. Training is important. Do you know it in Fivedogs by any chance? What? What'd you say? I'm going there for the holidays. Fivedogs is a beautiful village on the Berounka River. A beautiful village... on the Berounka River. You better go to Smichov and walk from there. But the Berounka is a river, isn't it? The Rydl ripped out all his rods in it. I'd rather stay in Prague, go swimming, or fish in the Vltava. The boys there are wacky, everything is wacky, except maybe the dogs. Tonda, get down right now. Coming. Stupid dogs. Come on, hurry up, there's a train coming. Which way to the Ludvik's, please? Which ones? There are three of them. The one who's the foreman. You're going the right way. And they've got a son in college? Why didn't you say so? They live over there by the river. Well, thank you very much. - You're welcome. Stupid girl. I almost thought you weren't coming. Hello. I'm Ludvikova. Well. You'll be staying upstairs in Jarek's room. I changed your bed. It's ventilated. The pump's in the yard. Don't pick the flowers there, Ludvik doesn't like it. Hurry up. Come on, Tonda. Well, you're home. You're not very talkative. Well, neither is our Jarek. Keep your shoes in the hall. Put the rods behind the cabinet. The sink's over there, you can fetch water. Don't splash. Open the window at night. Don't read too late. When you look around, come downstairs. You're really not very talkative. Tonda, after you've take a look around... come to dinner. You got your dad's eyes. Your nose, as well. You're wild like him, too. You're of Houdek's. I'm Ludvik. I'm sorry. - It's nothing. I hear you're a fisherman, I commend you on that. Yeah. - Yeah? Let's go. Seven. - Well, you are good. Pay attention. Six, also good. They're gonna go for the dough today. That's the root, you want me to get in there? You? Ruda? What are you doing here? Help! Help! I got it, it's a real monster. Help, Pragueer. Or it's gonna pull me in. Help, I got it, help Pragueer, or it's gonna pull me in. Such dink. Ruda! Ruda! Ruda! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! - Freeze! - Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! - Freeze! - Freeze! Freeze! - Freeze! - Freeze! Move over. What are you doing here? Not allowed in here. - Hands up. Did Drabek send you? He's gonna get it like last year. Hands! You guys are bullshitting, Ruda was in Bulgaria last year. In Bulgaria? Drabek comes here for every holiday. Why'd he send you? Come on. Are we gonna torture him? Ow, stop it. What are you doing? Ouch. Stop it. It hurts. Guys, guys, let him go. Let him go, he caught me a whitefish this big. Finally, you have come. What did you tell them about Bulgaria? What did I say? You said it. Tonda, don't be silly. Do you have a better friend here? We can fish together. You and fishing? Tonda. You want to see a big secret? You and your secrets. Tonda. Tonda, wait. Where do you think the center of the earth is? Down there. Drabek is your friend? He is. You're gonna have a hell of a time. That's my business. Then kick his ass, he deserves it anyway. Are you afraid of him? Well, what if I'm afraid of him? You'd be a coward. What? Pecka! Pecka, run. So, kick his ass. Next time. You're really afraid of him? Tonda! Don't go there! Tonda! Tonda! Don't go there! Don't go there. - Watch out. - Don't go there. Don't go there. Or he'll drag you under. Who? Eel as big as l.. l.. leg. Is there really a huge eel? What do I know? He was there 50 years ago. Fifty years ago? Fifty years ago. My dad saw it once. It was crawling out of the water on the shore. Probably for the peas. They went at it together with the innkeeper with the torches, but it escaped. It almost dragged the innkeeper into the water. Don't go at it alone. What would it catch on? That one? Probably on a chicken. Well? Just you wait. Tonda. Anca. Anca. Anca. Here. I'm still gonna catch that eel for you. Do you have a moment? What do you want? Nothing anymore. If it was there, it would have gone after the chicken. Right. Does it look good on him? Anca? Look. Don't tell me it's there. During the day, the eels sleep. - That's right. Have you been as far as the flooded stairs? He wouldn't get out of there alive. Let's go. How long can you stay underwater? That's what I wanna see. Snorkel. Here. One. Two. Three. Fourteen, fifteen. It's too short. If Lojza would lend you his googles. Franta, he's gonna need a harpoon. Let's go. Move over. Tips too, Grandpa. - Okay. All right. - There you go. Here. Stab yourself and your mom will tear you apart. Thanks. Now, just a long hose for the snorkel. - Okay. Squirts, did you hear? Okay. It's too thick. It doesn't matter. Run! What's gotten into you... I'll smack you. Why are you taking it? Where are you going with it? I know which one you are. Do you understand? Don't run away. I'll climb for it, I know which one you are, all of you. Don't think, you'll get over the laughter. You'll see. It's there, who's coming with me? Come on, guys. Guys, guys, come take a look. Eel as a leg. I MOVED AWAY. EEL. You put that in there? I didn't. - Me neither. So it was Drabek, someone must have told him we were going for the eel. Nobody's talking to him, we swore an oath. Not this one. You think I did it? Then Anca, she dated Drabek last year. Pecka, let's go. You guys are stupid. Anca, wait. Let's go. Anca! Anca, wait! Anca, wait! What's wrong, Pecka? Don't worry. Pecka, let's go. Anca! Anca! Pecka, wait. Pecka. Anca! Anca! Anca! Anca! Anca! Pecka, wait. Where do you keep running to? Wait. Pecka. You hear me? Wait. Pecka. A precise plan of the tunnel. What are you doing here? Be quiet. Look. Look, guys, Drabek is from Prague and so is this one. That's a fact. - Sure. See? They don't know we're here. Thanks. Now you know that Ruda knew everything. Then we'll get it out of him. I wanted you to believe me. Once he gets in, there's no escape. Have you ever been here before? Last year. But we only dated for two days. He was always bragging. He promised me an eel, but he came empty handed. You're different. You think so? Don't worry, I'm not an eel. Let go. But I know where it is. You're bullshitting. Of course I know, and I know why you want to get it. So tell me why? You promised it to someone. To who? Stear to the rock. That was a frog. You're a frog. What time is it? Hold it. What are you doing? It's for the eel. It's cold. They're even glowing. They're waterproof too. You think there are people on the stars too? I guess so. But it's probably not as cold as it is here. Why? I don't know. Have you ever seen a shooting star? I have. Where? In Bulgaria, it fell into the sea. It was all blue. They're not like that. They are. Have you ever seen a green one? I have, in the sky. And a silver one? Yes, I like that one the best. How fast do you think stars fall to earth? Probably pretty fast. Since they get that hot. You think so? I guess. Would you want to fly it? No. I don't think I would either. They're too far away. So we don't scare him off. That's right. Green ones are the prettiest. I like the golden ones, too. I've never seen those. But I've seen the green ones. I've only seen the golden ones from afar. You probably just thought they were golden. You think? That's it. I got it. Wait. - Quickly. Wait. That's my leg. It's gone. If you weren't talking about the stars, then... Tondo, wait. Above the weir is a flooded passageway to the quarry. Let's go. Last year, I spent the whole summer holidays hunting for it. Be careful. Jump. It sleeps in the pond during the day. And at night, he goes to the river. Maybe it could be caught in a pond during the day. When it's asleep. Before the boys come, okay? He was out all night. I said. He was out all night. I commend him for not telling us. He's a proper fisherman. A fisherman, yes, but his pants will fall off before he gets back home. He's already like a stick. That's enough. There's no other way to escape? No, unless it has another way I don't know about. Tonda. Look. They've got it. Hold on. They've got it. They've got it. Tonda. Don't jump in there, it'll pull you in. He's good. Tonda! Tonda! Oh boy. Tonda! Hold it! They're gone. Tonda. Long live Tonda! You're bleeding. It doesn't matter. It must have been at least 8 metres long. Well, at least 5. Hi, Anca. Hi, Ruda. Ruda, let's go. Ruda, let's go. Let me. It's in the river now, and it's not coming back here. It doesn't matter. Don't worry, we'll catch it someday. Maybe next year. Unless you'll be fishing for sharks in India.
