The Film Unit "Wektor" presents: These people didn't have their gentry, their bourgeoisie. They only had their rebels, their soldiers and leaders. They trudged towards Poland, straightening their weary backs, bent by overexertion for strangers. Looking at the landscape they have shaped, they grasped rifles and said: It's mine, it's ours! August 1919. August 1920. The first two Silesian uprisings. After ages of bondage, they were tests of courage, patriotism and soldierly discipline. Later on, in may 1921, comes the third one, the biggest. Well-organized this time, - a regular war with the occupant. There were no great military victories in the first two uprisings, and yet they were very important. They told the world that Poles were living in the border area of the Prussian empire - aggressive though defeated in the Great World War. Some of them are still among us. The brave of those days, who are still alive. Heroes of battles and skirmishes of that people's war bringing Silesia to Poland. Silesia - with its mines and riches, with its loyalty and love for Poland. They took Silesia towards Poland - and brought it there. This film is about those people. The old song of Silesian rebellions: "you tormented us so much..." will live here again as a song of longing for Poland. It was sung by Silesian insurgents in the year 1919 in that great uprising when the moon was bright.

Gabriel, now you're a member of the Polish Military Organization. - You know what it means? - I do. Leave us now, I must talk to them. Dad said we must guard him. If he gets hurt we can't show ourselves at home again. Let's go, Alois! Boys! Halt, or I'll shoot! Gabriel, what are you doing here with a rifle? - Where are you going that early? - To work of course! Don't you know? No work today! It's the uprising! Don't be silly, Gabriel. If the Germans catch you, they'll bust you! - Listen to me and give it up! - Even if they do, and I get shot, it'll be for Poland! Poland must come here, we've been waiting for 6 centuries! Are you coming with us? No. I'm going home. May I? - Sure, I'm not stopping you. - Didn't think you would! Dominic and Alois? Look, it's begun! The Germans - my arse! Shut the windows, we're opening fire! TOWN HALL Dominic! - Dominic! - Hide yourselves! Attention! We're shooting! Let's go! Cyril! - Let's go! - Cyril! Cyril! Cyril! Gabriel! Gabriel! Gabriel! Run! I only got hit in the back. Then why you've got a bandage on your head? Because I'm glad that my nut is alright! - It's a game not a war. - Shut up and stop joking! Four of us missing! Alois, Dominic, Cyril and Gabriel. - I've heard Gabriel's dead! - What'll we tell dad? Don't be silly, boys, here I am. - Hold him! - Hit him! Get off me! What's wrong? They hit Cyril... Drop the rifles and get out! Gabriel! Silence! Alois, Dominic, are you there? We're down here, in the cellar! Quiet! Where are you? Where are your trousers? Somewhere upstairs. A pity dad can't see you. Gabriel, know what you did? - What? - Acted without orders. - Did I? Next time I'll send you back home, I'm warning you. Crows don't pick out crows' eyes, but remember, I'm in command here. The Germans - my arse! The Germans - my arse! - Password! - Konigshutte. This is the Allied Commission. I'm taking them to the insurgents. Halt or I'll shoot! Password! Konigshutte. Where's the hospital? Are you injured? No, I've got an important message! Second street on the right. Is anybody here? I am. Have you seen a man here? No. Can I sip a few drops, for the heart? Thank you. Hey, you! Come back! You can kiss my arse! Get ready to shoot! It's me, Gabriel, don't shoot! I can see it's you! - Well, let's go! - Wait! What do you have to say? Won't you even ask where your brother Alois is? He was shot from the roof right in the head. - Rest. - Rest! Where were you all night? At mother's. I'm asking where were you? Gabriel? Can't tell you. But you will, some day? I will. Wake up, we're going. Why are you sitting here, Victor? Waiting for salvation? I'm sitting because I feel like it. I'm not asking you which way to go. There's only one way today. - with us or against! - I'm too young! - Gabriel is only 16... still wet behind ears. There's a whole crowd of you, boys, and I am the only man. - Girls abounded in our family. - I'm ashamed of you Victor! Stop quarrelling and join the uprising. - Should I? - Well, I've told you to! Then I'll go! - Godspeed! - Godspeed. Bring me some milk! There it stands like you know what. I bring a message! Boys, it's me! Don't come in! It's me, Gabriel speaking! A lot of Germans coming up from behind! They're coming! The boys are here! Alois and Johan are dead. Poles, Poles, what have you done, You've let the Germans in to your country. As you let them in, we will chase them out. As soon as we sharpen our sabers alright. Father should have come here. The devil will sooner come to heaven. - To hell with it! - Don't curse you cheeky squirt! He's sitting at his stove guarding the fire. Let me run home, it's only 300 yards! Let's say... to change my shirt. Erwin, come here a minute. Look under that sack. Hell! - Any use to you? - Yes, thank you! All right Gabriel, go! Give my regards to your dad! - Thank you, on his behalf! - Wait! He's brought us a case of dynamite. - Take it and hide it in the cellar. - I will. - Where's my mother and sisters? - They've fled to Poland. Cyril and Alois were killed. Shit! Forgive me, dad. Take what's in the cart to the cellar, please! Best regards from Erwin! Hey, mister, are you an insurgent? I'm not a mister. But you are an insurgent? Yes, my name is Basista, I live there. Where's the shooting? At our barricade, I think. Lieutenant Sowinski with a cannon, ready to fight! Welcome to the ranks of the insurgents. I've run off from the barracks in Cracow. An uprising is an uprising, sir. Don't call me sir, it's not customary here. Chose your own position. Yes sir! You are godsend! To your posts! Aim! Fire! Aim! Fire! Germans - our arses! Aim! Fire! Aim! Fire! To the barricade! We won't surrender Silesia. All Poland sings this song today. We'll give our blood for Silesia we, free sons of Poland. The enemy shall flee from here. So help us God. So help us God. Silence! What's this, a wedding or a fair? Count your bullets, and get ready to march! Praised be Jesus Christ. Praised be Jesus Christ. Forever and ever. Welcome, Erwin. Thank you for remembering. - I'd like to talk with you alone. - Let's go then. - We're making a stand here. - It's a great honor for me. Give me a rifle too, I'd like to do some shooting in my old age. Please. - Aren't you crossing over to Poland? - Me? My Poland is here. Give your father your rifle. Go to Myslovice to fetch the ammunition. Be back before dawn. Pour it in. May God be with you father! Godspeed! Giddy-up! Attention! You wait for my command! Don't even pee without orders. Get down! Sorry, Erwin, it won't happen again. See if Bernard's coming. Can't you hear me? What's the matter with you? What's happened to him? It's the first time he's seen blood. I reacted worse though. They've brought up a gun! Franek, Eusebius! - Don't scare us! - What do you want? - Let's start! - All right! Get your bullets ready and wait for the command. Franek, Eusebius, another barrel! Erwin, look. Get ready for close combat! Take him away! Here's some soup, eat it, boys. Here's some soup, eat it, boys. Here's some soup, eat it, boys. Our hen should be somewhere. Boys, our hen! Cheep, cheep! Come here! There you are! Take the case, boys. Hey, boys! Father! Father, talk to us! Dad! Dad, where are you! Where's father? Here!! Dad! Have grenades ready, throw them at close range. Attack! See her? Where is she from? I don't know her. Can't see her. Do you know her? We're retreating. There, to the last scrap of land. What's wrong? We'll bury them. We can't leave our home like that. We'll offer it to God. That's it! At least one meter apart. A hole every half a meter. Don't worry, Erwin. Take everybody up there. - We haven't much time. - We'll make it. Faster, Franek! Who is staying down here? I thought Eusebius, as he gets nervous easily. Do you agree? Not only do I agree, I demand that from you, brothers! You bet I'm going to stay! We'll draw lots. Me! - Hang on in there! - Take care! They're coming. God almighty... The uprising is over... The uprising is over. We've done our job. Now we must cross the river to Poland. We can't do much now. I'm not your commander anymore. Thank you for everything. Write your wills now, because we're going on our last journey. Come to your senses, Emil! This isn't the last uprising we're making! We can come back and start again. Have you finished? - What's a will? - A sort of last wish. Collect the wills. Erwin, why didn't Poland help us? I'm wondering myself. Maybe she's got into bigger troubles. Take off everything that hinders running. Down there we'll throw the grenades and jump into the river. See that hand? Be sure, as you are sure you see my hand, we'll make Poland here. Whether they like it or not. And now, let's go. Give the grenades to Franek and Eusebius. Get ready! To your posts! Erwin, I wanted to tell you where I was then. - On the German side, with that nurse. - Stop talking! Now! Load your rifles! Aim! Up my arse! Long live Poland! Where is my dear son now? The Germans must have killed him in the uprising. Oh, you evil men, why did you kill my son? Sing to him you birds of God if his mother cannot find him. - Where am I? - In Poland. Gabriel... Erwin... - Gabriel, can you see us? - Yes. - Gabriel, can you hear us? - Yes. Get a doctor! The End
