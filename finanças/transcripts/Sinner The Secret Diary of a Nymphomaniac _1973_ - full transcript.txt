The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac - Can I get a cigarette, please? - Of course. May I sit here? Yes. Please do. - Can I have a drink? - Of course. Pepe, bring us a bottle! Listen... why don't we go somewhere more intimate? Good idea. Pepe, bring it to table 7. - I bet you're not from round here. - No, I'm from Havana. Havana? That's cool. - You've been there? - No, but I know it's a marvellous place. What do you do for a living, darling? Don't answer. Let me guess... Artist? No. Another bottle? Well, er... I'm getting a little drunk. Oh no! I want to get drunk too. I'm feeling good with you. Come on, let's get another one! Pepe, another bottle... - Would you like to sleep with me? - Of course, but you must be expensive. I am... but I'm worth it, aren't I? Yes... You're worth a million! Wait... I'll just get my things in my dressing room. I'll be right back. - It's daylight already. - Don't worry, we're going nearby. This way. It's not far, darling... - Where? - There. - You live here? - Let's say I often come here. My head's spinning... Police? Come at once to Hotel Miramar, by the port. Room 37. A woman's just been murdered. Hurry up! Police. Get dressed and come with us. I committed that murder while temporarily unbalanced due to drink, after a violent argument. Will you sign? I'm innocent... innocent! Alright... You want me to prove it was a sadistic and premeditated murder? That gets the death penalty! Sign, for God's sake, I'm off on leave. I am innocent. Throw him in the hole. Never mind that bloody idiot! Got the autopsy results? Not yet, inspector. Great! Has the guy got any family? He's married, that's all we know. I must speak to his wife. Call her in. Yes, sir. - Hello? - I'd like to speak to Mrs Ortiz. Yes, it's Mrs Ortiz. I'd like to meet you, I have some rather unpleasant things to tell you. What's this about? Well, Madam, your husband has just been arrested. He's charged with murder. That can't be right! It is, Madam. In any case, I have to ask you to come to my office as soon as possible. Alright, I'll come. Goodbye. Thank you, Rosa... Thank you for coming. Don't thank me. The police told me to come. How dreadful! Rosa, I swear I didn't kill that girl. I don't believe you anymore. Why would I have killed her? You know me... - No! - I'm no killer. I don't know you. I know nothing. Despise me if you want. But don't assume I'm a killer. What I assume doesn't matter. We're finished now. Please Rosa, you can't let them sentence me! I am still your husband, don't forget. Maybe I will help you. But only as much as I would help any useless bum. Goodbye. - Did you talk to him? - Yes. - Still think he's innocent? - I don't know. Have you ever heard of Countess Anna de Monterey? No. It seems she was closely connected with the victim. - Are you interested? - No. - If I need you, I'll call. - Goodbye, sir. - There's a Mrs Ortiz asking for you. - Show her in. Alright, ma'am. - Hello. - Hello, Miss. I'm sorry to disturb you but I need to talk to you. Please sit down. - May I offer you a drink? - No, thanks. What's this about? My husband is in prison on a murder charge. So what? I don't understand. Let me finish. He's accused of killing a young prostitute called Linda Vargas. Ah, Linda... And you want information about Linda Vargas? I believe my husband is innocent. Don't you? I don't care. I don't know Mr...? - Ortiz. - Ortiz? Who told you she knew me? The inspector in charge. He asked me about you and the connection between you and Linda Vargas. - What do you know about Linda's life? - Nothing. I can't see the link between a rich woman and a cheap whore. You're surprised that a girl like Linda was my friend? It also surprises me sometimes. Come closer... When I first met little Linda, she'd not been in town long. She was a bit lost, since she came from a miserable little village. One day she got bored of that dull life and ran away from her parents' house. And that was Linda's first physical contact with a man. But the lure of the city must have been stronger for Linda stayed here anyway. She worked in many places and had other bitter experiences. - Linda... - 23... Come here! Coming! I need you for a while. - Your panties! - Oh no! - Don't make a fuss, you bitch! - Please don't! - You like that, don't you? - Please don't! - Come on, spread them! - Leave me alone! One day she came to deliver some linen. Anyone in? I'd never made love with a girl before. For me it was a new and exciting feeling. Her mouth was so soft and so warm! She gave me an intense pleasure, more than any man could. She was discovering orgasm. Linda was very tight and had only ever made love to men for whom she felt no desire. They hurt her when they penetrated her. She stayed with me. We loved each other. She was just a kid, naive, spontaneous, wild. I taught her women's secrets and the subtleties of love-making. It was a voyage of discovery for both of us. She learned to give herself entirely and eagerly, holding back nothing. Soon she came to seek pleasure for its own sake. - Are you alone? - Yes. Where's Anna? At the hairdresser's, I think. You smoke, don't you? Sure! I've got a bit of a cold. Yes, I know... You know, you've become a beautiful girl... In fact, I wasn't jealous... not yet. It was all part of a game. A new one I wanted to play... because it sounded like fun. So it was thanks to me that Linda learnt how to make love to a man, to get orgasms from a male organ, to feel the intoxicating sensation as it thrusts inside you. She fell in love with Alberto and they went on seeing each other. But without me. I was excluded from their sex romps. They used to meet in a trendy disco called The Lucky Ghost. It was there Linda met Maria, a gorgeous Brazilian, who later became her lover. I love you, Alberto. I love you with all my being. You're my first and probably only true love. You took your time answering! - Sorry, ma'am. We didn't expect you. - Is my husband in? - I don't know, ma'am. I think so, but... - Thank you. Forgive me, Angela, I can explain... Don't bother. Listen! I give you 10 minutes, not a second more, to leave this house. You and this "girl"... But Angela, don't be like this. She means nothing to me! You dared bring her here! I guess it's not the first time... Go! Get out now! Go back to being a cheap playboy, you loser! Forgive me. Forgive me, Angela! Forgive me. Without you I'm nothing, I know that. Get rid of this whore... Then we'll see. Get out! Get out of here! The days that followed this break-up were terrible for Linda. She lay prostrate in bed for days on end. I was planning a few weeks' vacation in the Bahamas. That night, I was having a drink with some friends and Linda was wandering in the house. Her eyes were blank, the very image of despair. - What's wrong, Linda? - What's it to you? Why that tone of voice? What have I done? Nothing. You dumped me! Abandoned me... just when I needed you most. What do you think? I need your permission to go on vacation? Remember, you're just a little slut I picked up out of charity. Bitch! I didn't take it too seriously. I left the next day. After I'd gone, Linda hung out with her new friend, the stripper Maria. She was friends with a photographer who specialised in a certain type of picture. Perfect! That's it... Be sexy, very sexy... Lustful... Great! Very good! Right... That's it... Fantastic! These pics have to make people horny, really get them going! What soft skin... Here, I'll fix your belt, it's sexier like this... Come here, Linda! That's right, just like that. Great... Now a little action, kittens! Who are these women? What's going on here? Get out! Get out of here! Next morning, she left without a word. Later, I heard she was posing for porn photos. It was then Linda started on drugs. Alberto met her a few days after she left me. She was off her head and spent hours more or less prostrate. Come with me. Did you ask your wife first? - You coward! Loser! - Shut up. I'll take you home... - Might she have killed herself? - It's very possible. Do you know if she had already met my husband? She met lots of people, slept with lots of people... Both men and women. A nymphomaniac, then? Since you say so... Yes! A nymphomaniac. Heartless... Reckless... and stupid! - Did you ask to see me, ma'am? - Yes, but sit down... Can I get a drink? Yes. Waiter, please...? What's wrong? I am alone. We're all alone, you know... Anyway, you're no longer alone, baby! What's up? Are you afraid? Is this the first time you...? It's the first time I've been in a place like this. What are you looking for? You know Linda Vargas? It's my husband who's accused of murdering Linda. Yes... So what do you want? I don't know... To weep, to die, to avenge myself... On whom? On everyone, on life... And I also want to know... I go in first. I don't like to wear clothes. Tell me... Had he drunk a lot, my husband? Yes. A dozen bottles of champagne... At least! - Your friend was some slut! - That was her job... And it's mine too, you know? We don't get much for stripping. Fortunately we get a cut on the drinks. I'm sure my husband didn't kill Linda. He couldn't have. How do you know? Maybe he's a sadist like Jack the Ripper? - Men are capable of anything, you know. - Thanks. Do you like to walk round naked? I like my body. I like to look at myself. I like to touch myself... Don't you? I don't know... I never looked at myself naked. Nor has my husband! - Even when you fucked? - Then... We turned the lights off! Stop! Is it turning you off or on? Both, perhaps. I finally realised that fucking is really all I like to do. A girl's soft crotch or a beautiful penis is all I need. Yet, sometimes I still remember my village, my grandmother. She was the only one in my family who had any heart. The only one who understood me. Maybe I should have stayed with her. If God exists, I hope he hasn't been as hard on her as he has on me. I also often think of the Countess de Monterey. We share so many memories. Sad memories and passionate ones too. Memories of hot and wonderful embraces. Anna, your mouth on my vulva brought me back to life. A shame you're such a frivolous, arrogant and cruel creature. What are you reading? Linda's diary. I want to give my body and my vulva to all my brothers and sisters. To all those whom life has offered only pain and misery. You still think such a girl was only a cheap whore? I don't know. I'm not sure anymore. I'd like to place an ad saying: To all the sad and rebuffed ones... those with neither money, beauty or courage to have a woman, I offer my warm vagina and my writhing buttocks, so they can penetrate me. I offer myself to you, young boys wanking over a photo of a pretty girl, lesbians who are too scared to approach a woman. Today I met a wonderful creature, Maria Toledano. She's such a turn on when she dances that I came just watching her move. The way she looked at me, I immediately knew she liked girls. I'm sure she likes me. Tomorrow I will dance to arouse her, to seduce her. I will try to make her feel as I did when I saw her move her beautiful little ass. She must be mine and I must be hers. There's no other way. Now Maria is mine. Her touch fills me with joy. And I hope that mine penetrate her as deeply as a black man's huge penis. To see her come at the touch of my tongue, of my fingers... gives me such pleasure. It's my revenge on life. And when her hot full lips explore my vagina... When her fingers penetrate me from both sides and almost meet I scream with pleasure. Sometimes I have weird fantasies I'd like to give her to a man. He wouldn't take her, I would give her to him... but she wouldn't get pleasure from him. Definitely not! After his failure, I would have him watch her come as my fingers caress her. My revenge on all men who have humiliated and abused me... who forced themselves on me! My key! Always the bloody same! Yesterday evening we had a fun adventure. There's this photographer staying at our hotel. Probably a German dyke. I noticed that as soon as I saw her. She phoned and asked if we'd pose for some dirty pics. Even on the phone I could hear her excitement. I bet she'd been listening to us making love through the wall... while pleasuring herself. Whatever, her proposal seemed like a stroke of luck, a chance to start a new existence. I'm your neighbour, Miss Schatz. I'm a photographer and I'd love you to pose for some special pictures. It's well paid and will be fun! Right. See you tomorrow, then. Let's go! Don't move! Great... Perfect... Don't move! Yes... That's the one, darlings. Don't move...There... Oh, yes! Yes! Like that... Yes! Hold it... That first photo session was more like a party. The thought of someone taking naked pictures of me making love... was very exciting to me. It was such a turn-on that we got soaking wet and ended up making love for real while the photographer got off on that. The thought that the pictures would turn on both men and women... was delightful. And best of all, I got paid! By the way, I've never understood why society disapproves... of people of the same sex making love while it's normal with someone of the "opposite" sex, as they say. All's fair in love. All is pure Only love can save us from boredom and numbness. Only love can sometimes make life worth living... and physical love above all else. Whenever I feel down, which is often... I think about a nice penis or a woman's hot tongue and I feel better. When my sweet pussy opens up and gets moist... that's when real life begins. What happens before and after is just useless wandering. Maria and me sometimes met up with other losers like us to smoke weed. Share a joint, as they say. At the end of the day, it's a bit of a downer but sometimes it can make life seem a little less sad. Anyway, that was how I got to meet the doctor. Open up in the name of the law! Police! Drug Squad. Remove your glasses! Please Miss, can you come here? What is it? Come with me. So that's why they released me! - Don't be a fool... - Oh, I'm a fool alright! But an interesting one. How old are you? - Twenty. - You're not really into drugs. So what's going on? I don't know... Nothing. Do you have any family? I guess so. In the country. I'll try to give you one. At least for a while. This is my house and my clinic. - Doesn't look like a clinic. - But it is. True, there's no surgery, no expensive equipment. It's a place to rest. You'll find peace and quiet here. Let me show you your room. Thus began my new existence. The doctor said he would remake me into someone healthy and clean. I kept telling him he was wasting his time, that I was too far gone already but he wouldn't give up. He talked about music, youth crisis, about artificial highs, platonic love, spiritual union and so on... To be honest, I didn't really understand everything. But I was proud to be treated like a human being. One day, I offered myself to him. Asked him to make love to me. He didn'twant to. He wouldn't kiss me. Didn't even come with me to my room. Precisely because he was attracted to me but he thought it would have been unfair to take advantage of me. I felt terribly disappointed. Come... No, no... Try to sleep. Before coming here, to Guanaquil... long ago... I was only 14 then... I lived in a house like this, but not so grand, of course. In the mornings, there was the same fresh air. And just as here, the birds would sing outside my window. Why did you leave your village? I wanted to experience life in a big city. I used to watch TV in a bar near my house... The streets full of life, the hustle and bustle everywhere... All these bright lights literally fascinated me. So one day I took the train. And I never went back. Why? A man... a stranger I met... raped me in a fairground. I cried out, screamed... but the music drowned my cries for help. It all span round in my head like the Ferris wheel. He was red faced, like a slaughtered pig. He threatened to kill me... He beat me! Carmen! Carmen! Yes, doctor? Put her to bed and give her two sedative pills. The day after I confided in him, I escaped. My body was craving for caresses, penetrations and kisses... I've really missed you. Where were you? I... I don't know. Undress! What do you want? I really tried to put you on the right road but you're just a whore! Since my efforts have been in vain, I may as well get something out of it... Now, get out of here! And so I went back to Maria. But something inside me had died. I had trusted that man. I thought he could save me from myself but in the end, he behaved like all the others. Maybe it was my fault anyway. Maybe I carry in me the seeds of my own destruction. Excuse me, I'll be right back... Oh, Alberto! Let me go! What do you want? Spit it out! It's you I want! I don't want you to hang out with these doped up hippies. I've looked for you everywhere. Really? Why? Because I've realised I really care for you. - You're really something! - Listen to me. I've thought a lot... about you and me... If you want to, I'm ready to give it all up. Shame it took you so long to work out. Sorry, but you're too late. I went back to Maria, but I feel alone. I don't like my life anymore. The time has come for me to finish with it all. I would like them to write on my grave: "Here lies a poor girl who lived only for love." Don't cry. Linda wouldn't have wanted that. - Is that better? - Yes. Don't stop... I recognised him when he came into the club. The beast who has ruined my life. Since I've decided to kill myself, I'll frame him for my murder. Maria, please... Can I take this? Yes. Thank you. That man destroyed my life. I was only a child when he raped me. If there is any justice, he must pay. He must pay! He must pay! He must pay!
