- [Narrator] Welcome to the 14th Annual Reel Rock Film Tour. (gentle guitar music) Presented by The North Face. Since 1966 we have viewed walls not as obstacles but as opportunities. From the big walls of Yosemite to the high peaks of the Himalayas. We were searching for a personal kind of freedom. In this pursuit we found a community strengthened by different stories, experiences, and perspectives. This community has shown us that the only way forward, is together. Walls are meant for climbing. - [Climber] Okay, ready? Go. - History begins. You have no idea what to expect - [Nina] I know that I can do it, it's like, game on. (screams) - No gear, no falls! - [Narrator] Reel Rock 14 is also brought to you by Black Diamond. We design and manufacture the most innovative mountain equipment in the world.

The Nose speed record. - [Male Rock Climber Voiceover] This has gotta be the coolest racetrack in the world. - 16 minutes faster. - [Narrator] It's time for Reel Rock 14. (sounds of brushing teeth) (zipper zipping) (upbeat guitar music) - We're out here in Roy, New Mexico. A really big sandstone bouldering area, very remote feeling. It's definitely flown under the radar for the past few years which is pretty nice. There's a good chance that you'll be the only ones out here. - Nina and I have a really good relationship, we go out climbing a lot, She's super motivated. - [Interviewer] Who climbs harder on the boulders? - Oh Nina climbs way harder on the boulders. - Come on James. (James grunting) - Holy shit. Sometimes she can warm up on my project. - This is so fun. - [James] Nice, come on Nina. - So cool, yay! When I go out climbing, I'm not necessarily looking for the hardest grade, I'm really driven by aesthetics. - Nice, good, come on. - I wanna look for the most beautiful lines. - That's good, I got you, come on. - The ones that make me react in this visceral way. And it just so happens to be the tall ones. - Nina likes climbing taller problems which can be a little nerve wracking sometimes. (James speaking faintly) - Oh my God, that was kind of exciting. - Yeah? - I'll see a line and it'll be this really cool big thing and I'll think, do I actually wanna climb this thing? Is it worth it for me? And if it is, next step is to check it out on the rope. Whoop. Make sure I know what the holds are and what my beta is like. It's about dealing with the fear on a rope, really immersing myself in it. So in the real moment of climbing it, I can feel that fear still rise up on an instinctual level but just be able to manage it a lot better and be like okay, I feel this fear, I hear it, I sense it, but I don't have to listen to it. (electronic music) (upbeat music) (deep breathing) - [James] Good job. - Ye! - [James] It's easy to be inspired by Nina. She's always looking to push it harder. Looking for the next big thing. - For the past couple years I had this seemingly far away goal to climb this beautiful boulder called Too Big To Flail. (dramatic music) It's in the Buttermilks which is world renowned for very, very, big boulders. (dramatic piano music) It's probably around 50 feet or so. You walk up to the base, you look at it, and your eyes just keep going up. (slow dramatic music) You think, oh my gosh, it's just sheer. (slow dramatic music) I first heard about Too Big To Flail watching Alex Honnold climb it in one of the Reel Rocks way back in the day. - I wrapped down it and tried all the moves. Oh shit. And just thinking about doing it, I was like this is terrifying. Shit. - [Rock Climber Spotter] You okay? - [Alex] Yup. - Seeing Alex on that climb, my heart was in my throat. How can he do that? That's just totally nuts. Never did I think, oh maybe I could do that one day. - [Colette] When Nina started coming on the scene, 2010, 2011, she was just one of those young guns coming up quick. (upbeat music) - [James] Solid. - [Colette] Yeah. Doing double digit grades just kind of effortlessly. - [James] Come on. - [Nina] I really like doing these hard problems. - [James] Nice one. - Yes, it feels so good. But I realized, I wanna expand a little bit, push myself mentally. My first highball was probably this super overhanging V10 in Massachusetts called Speed of Life. It's got a terrible landing, you have to like jump off to the ledge behind or you fall down this big chute. I tried for a couple years and I fell so many times. It really honed my sense of falling. - [James] Nice, get in there. (Nina screaming happily) - That gave me confidence to try these climbs that were taller. I tried Evilution Direct. - [James] Come on Nina! - [Nina] I'm at the lip and I've got this heel hook. - [James] Yeah, come on. - [Nina] And I remember everything happening in slow motion. Just like, no. I saw my knee coming up straight towards my face. (slow motion grunting) But at the last second I moved my knee out of the way so I was totally fine. I realized in know how to fall well. I could orientate myself in space and control my landing. I just took a few minutes and did it next go. Done! - [James] Nice Nina! (upbeat music) - [Colette] Go Nina! (group cheering and clapping) - [Nina] I started to seek out these massive boulders. (slow upbeat music) Building my mental strength in a step-by-step manner. Anyone can do it, it just takes practice. (Nina screaming) - [Colette] In the last five years Nina's been going through a process, doing all the steps. - Yes! - To get to the level she's at. But I also think it just takes a certain kind of mentality. Maybe Nina just has that gene that makes her a little less fearful. - Oh my God. - [Colette] She has this ability to access the risk, keep a calm mind, and just go for it. - [James] Oh yeah, come on. Oh yeah, come on. Yeah! - [Colette] Woo! Yeah! Two years ago she really took another step up with Ambrosia. - [Nina] Sup dude? - I was there with her filming it and it was kind of terrifying. - [Nina] On a boulder like Ambrosia it's full commitment. When you're that high up, there's no falling. - [Colette] You just kinda hold your breath and just trust that she wouldn't put herself in that position unless she was 100% confident that she could do it. (slow dramatic music) - [Nina] When I did Ambrosia it was perfect. I had no fear, I wasn't thinking about anything. I just let my body climb. Yes! - [James] So good! - [Nina] Yes! I got to the top and I felt ecstatic. It felt like a religious experience. Yay! - [James] That's so awesome, yeah! - [Colette] So sick dude! - [Nina] James was there and he definitely had the poker face. - I'm glad you didn't fall. - Me too. He looked calm and collected but I know underneath he was shaking like a leaf. - [Colette] Were you nervous? - Yeah, I kinda wanted to puke. (Colette laughs) I mean no, no, not nervous at all. - [Colette] James understands the consequences of falling. When he was younger he was free soloing, took a huge fall, and put himself in the hospital. - I was climbing in Joshua Tree National Park. The way backing up, this really cool crack, and I was about 10 feet from the summit. I felt myself barn door a little and then I fell and I fell 70 feet and hit this ledge. I spent 81 days in the hospital and had eight surgeries. It took me about a year to go from prone on my back to climbing again. Seeing Nina do a lot of these highballs, I understand what compels her but I never want her to have an accident like that. (peaceful music) When she first told me she wanted to do Too Big To Flail I wasn't exactly enthusiastic. It's just more dangerous. But you don't wanna discourage your partner from their goals. It's important just to be supportive. Gonna pre-make the coffee, yeah. - That's a keeper right there (laughs). - If she's gonna do something like this you can't project your own fears to much. (dramatic music) - I'm not sure if I would call Too Big To Flail the next logical step. I don't know if any of this is even logical to begin with. - Okay, you're on belay. - [Nina] The process began. Top rope in, check out the moves. It's slabby, it's insecure, and it's really reachy. I had seen Honnold on tip-toes reaching between his holds so I knew that I had to do it in my own way. - Is the foothold good? - No. - [James] Fuck. - [Nina] A couple of people have fallen off of this middle section. This guy Nick took a ground fall. - Fuck! - [Nina] Another climber had to jump off and fractured his ankle but no one's fallen off the top crux's. God damn. - [James] Nina figured out the crux moves and then on the top section she jumps her feet. Jumping, 45 feet off the ground without a rope. That's not ideal but she was very methodical about it. (piano music) - [Nina] I worked the climb so many times just getting it down to a point where I know that I have the physical capability to crimp on these holds and to place my feet and then to keep moving upwards because when I don't have a rope, I won't have a choice, there's no backing off. (peaceful music) I just wanna reach this state of action of my body and tranquility in my mind. (slow piano music) - [James] Today's the day. She's going for it. (slow piano music) I got the pads up but this thing's 50 feet tall there's not a whole lot we can do to spot her. I mean, she's up there by herself. (slow dramatic music) (Nina deep breathing) (eerie dramatic music) (Nina grunting) (upbeat dramatic music) - Being in tall places, I love that feeling of absolute certainty and control and confidence in a situation that seems totally dangerous. I'm so psyched! But I can say with certainty, I've got this. (slow upbeat music) (slow country music) - I talk to people and they say, where do you live? And I say Emery County and they say, we don't know where that is. Well it's in southeast, central Utah. - Middle of nowhere. Things haven't changed for a long time around here. Until the climbers started showing up in Joes Valley. (slow banjo music) (upbeat music) - Our crew of climbers came out of Salt Lake City in the mid 90's. That generation of climber, in that era, bouldering was the new thing. - There was no harnesses, there was no rope, this was a new style of what climbing could be. - Come on! - We were completely obsessed with our little world of burning each other off and trying to get as strong as possible. - The culture of it was young, punk rock, fuck everything we're just gonna go do what we want. Climbing back then, it was more on the fringe. - I think we were definitely outsiders. We were dallying from what's going on in the real world, on the road all the time. - We were fiending for a new rock. So when somebody says hey there's great boulders two and a half hours away from Salt Lake, let's go. - Oh my God, there's a bird. - We drove to Joes Valley, just like holy crap. (dramatic music) There's literally tens of thousands of boulders. This has everything we've ever looked for in a bouldering area, like this is sick. - There were suddenly these like striking black streak boulders. There was slab bouldering, steep bouldering, super high bouldering. - The Wild West mentallity of let's just go just around that corner and see what's over there. - The more you hike, the more you're gonna find-- - Nice! Nice. - Classic climbing, then you just come here, and it was awesome. (dramatic music) - Hold on (grunts in pain). - Steven, he was really young, really friggin strong. (Steven screaming in pain) - I want my mommy. Can't put that in the video. - Steven Jeffrey, he went down to Joes Valley and basically found his personal canvas. He put up some amazing problems. - So it's been, let's see, 25 years right? 35 years? (laughs) 25 years-- I've been coming to Joes for over the last 20 years. I was 16, 17 years old. I would come down in my RV, kind of like runaway style kid going climbing on these rocks. It was just complete freedom but it felt like an alien place in a way. Joes Valley sits basically in the dead middle of Utah. This rural area, it would almost make me anxious sometimes when I come out here 'cause I was this naive kid from the city and here was a whole different world. It was different culture down here. There was small town next to Joes Valley.` I was actually scared to even go in the grocery store to buy supplies 'cause it's like, man these are mean muggin people. - Yeah check this out. I remember going to a bar down there, the video camera dressed like a climber. one of the bartenders just shaking her hat at us and pointing at the door. - [Bar Patron] Get this motherfucker right here to shut the video camera off. - It wasn't like they didn't like us, it just they knew we weren't gonna fit in, it's not a safe place for everybody. When you go down there, you're in their country. - I remember camping the bottom of the left fork and some dudes in a big giant truck pull up and they're like hey you fucking hippies and start shooting a bunch of bullets over the top of our tents and we're just like, ah. - What the fuck are you doing? - We're camping here man. - The locals, they didn't know who we were and what we were doing. (upbeat music) - I can remember seeing the strange guys with the mattresses on their back. And I'm thinking, what in the world? (grunts) - They're doing what? They're climbing on our rocks (laughs)? - I mean I just couldn't imagine that being anything he'd really wanna do. - Ow, fuck. Fucking ow. - Being an outsider and looking at bouldering just looks really weird. (upbeat music) - They all wanna climb up the hardest part of this 12 foot rock. - Ow! - It was just-- - Ow! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - My first thoughts? They're crazy. (screams and barks) - In my head I kept thinking, do you not have rocks where you live? - Here in Emery County, this is a small community. Everybody kind of knows each other. We're cowboys and coal miners and power plant folks. - We're quite a conservative group. - We are Mormons so we are very, very family oriented. - Yeah we're very, very churchy here I guess you could say. - We all try to protect our own. So when we saw the rock climbers coming to the area it was like hey, we don't know who these people are. - I was a manager at Food Ranch here in Orangeville. - Food Ranch the hot spot for the climbers. So this is where I come whenever I have a serious case of the munchies. - The owner was scared, he didn't know why they were here. They dressed a little different, they had the dreads, the man buns, you know we knew that they were showering in our bathrooms 'cause the bathroom floor would be wet, little smelly. - At Food Ranch I'd be hanging out there with my friends and these people would walk in and they look like vagabonds. Old dirty clothes like they'd been out walking in the mud. Just kind of gross, I feel so bad (laughs). - Especially back then, the climbers were, I mean the dirtbag was the real deal you know, like your down jacket was soiled. You look like a homeless person. - I don't mean this in no bad way but they reminded me of back in the 70's, the hippies, just free-spirited people. - Yeah! - You can tell the climbers just by, they look a little disheveled and tired. In fact we've heard a lot of climbers call themselves dirt baggers. - Yeah, we're scared to say that because we didn't ever want to offend anybody but they'll tell us, we're dirt baggers. - And so they're here, where are they coming from? And coming into our little town. - There were a lot of people talking, in fact, there was a lot of concern. Are these guys going to kidnap our kids? - My mom was always like, Cambrie stay away from those people they're probably weirdos. - Yeah I wasn't exactly the poster boy for the Mormon community. My style, hey what's happening? I was Mad Max versus Flea. (screams) My van always had some sort of skull. The bone shifter, got my little friend hanging here, here's been out in the sun a little bit to long. Water fountain. - Whenever Jason stopped at a gas station he would put in six dollars and 66 cents of gas just to be weird. - Poster boy for being a freak. - We've heard that there's some goofy mother fucker around. - I wanted to make people think, confuse them, and I think it succeeded to come extent. (birds chirping) - For years there was just a small group of people climbing on the rocks in Joes Valley but climbing areas go through changes. The first turning point of Joes was descent of the Black Lung from Ben Moon. - Ben Moon was one of the most famous climbers in the world. - He came over from England to Joes Valley. He was trying an undone project. It was absolutely gorgeous. - Nice. - Technical, powerful, really hard. At the time it could have been the hardest boulder problem in the world . (screams in pain) - It became this epic battle Ben had with the problem. - Come on Ben you dozy fuck. (screams in pain) Oh fuck. - I was thinking, I hope no locals can here us out here. Fuck. Piss off snow you fucking wanker. (dramatic drums) - Nice. - When Ben did Black Lung, I mean this is like the perfect lining in a developing area. - Fucking God damn it man, I got that perfect. - It put Joes on the map. - Published in all the magazines throughout the world. You'd pick up Grimper in France and there's a picture of Ben climbing this iconic boulder problem. So now everyone wants to come to Joes Valley. - The climbing population started growing rapidly. - All of a sudden there's a thousand people going over a weekend. Sprinter vans just bombarding up the canyon. - Tents all over the side of the road. - It's an invasion of the entire world on this little place. - I can understand locals being like, oh it's a nuisance. - Locals worried about to many people here, it was the us against them type deal and they're coming into our towns and our communities. - A lot of townspeople really was kind of against the climbers coming in and only wanted to keep them out. - Two climbers were sitting on the lawn at the library and got the cops call on them. - Honestly we thought we were being invaded by a bunch of potheads. (police siren) We found a little bit of pot on, pretty much everyone we did stop so. - There was definitely tension building. - Get a job! - I was worried that climbing access could be taken away or restricted from us because in a lot of areas across the United States people turn against climbing and even ban it and this one is just to good to lose. - There was this moment of, we need to connect before it explodes. So one day, I was at the Food Ranch and there was a sign saying city clean up. It was like perfect, let's go to the city clean up. So we show up in the morning and it's a bunch of ladies preparing food. - We look over and there's these different people over there. They look a little bit like bums, you think well maybe they're homeless and then they got up and walked over to us. - We're here for the clean up, when does it start? And the four ladies like, oh thank God we were just here thinking you needed food. - Oh my words, we were so excited we said, are you serious? You're here to help us? We were just amazed that outsiders would come in and give something to our community. - The classic part was, here I am shoveling on Main Street, it's a Saturday, all my friends from Salt Lake are coming to climb and they see me and they're like, what did you get arrested in town? What are you doing shoveling the sidewalk? And I'm like, city clean up day, I'm helping out. (truck engine passing by) - After that I really started thinking about how climbers could help Emery County grow because the reality was this area had fallen on pretty hard times. - In Emery County we've had hay days and we've had slumps. Our major economic driver has always been coal. 40 years ago there was 20 something mines in Emery County, now we have three running mines so it's not the job provider that it used to be. - Yeah the mines shutting down definitely has been a hardship. A lot of people had to move. - The power plants won't last forever so we need to figure out who we are and what we wanna become in the next 20 years. - There's a lot of concern that Emery County will become a ghost town someday. - This place was struggling, they just didn't know they were sitting on another great resource. - When the locals, like when we walk around we see these lines of stone and we're just like, oh my gosh, this is incredible. I was asked to give a presentation to the City Council about bouldering. People asked me, those things on your back, what is it? One local thought you climbed with it on your back and so when you fell you just jumped onto your back. I put up a photo of a Sprinter van and they all chuckled, oh yeah we see those all the time. The next photo is the inside of the Sprinter remodeled and how much all this cost. Climbing shoes are a $175, crash pads are $200. I was like, believe it or not these people living in the dirt, have money and spend it right? - So then people were saying that everyone's a millionaire who's a rock climber. I was like, these people are millionaires? I'm very confused as to why they're out here in Emery County instead of traveling to like Paris and stuff. - We left town and came back the next weekend and there's sign's saying we love rock climbers. Food Ranch was the first to catch on to the idea. Go in there and next thing you know there's chalk and crash pads. - This is the weirdest story but there was an empty bottle next to the dumpster at Food Ranch. You opened the lid, smelled it, like phew. We kept thinking, what is this? We started talking to a climber and he explained all about the probiotics and kombucha. They says if you carry it, we'll buy it. Started carrying it in every flavor that you could imagine. - The big final connection for rock climber to town was this idea of a festival. So it started out with me and my girlfriend Adriana, we were talking with some locals about it. - The whole concept for the festival, it's about bringing the two communities together, stepping outside your bubble. - Locals coming together with a bunch of crazy rock climbers. We weren't sure if it was gonna work out. - [Announcer] Hotdogs, get your hotdogs! Ketchup, mustard, relish, get your fixen's. (crown talking) - We're gonna try to get to know each other better. - These are the best chili dogs I've ever ate. - Or even maybe learn some stuff in the process. - All right everyone let's get ready, let's get our crash pads and everything and let's head out to these boulders over here okay. (upbeat music) We had all kinds of folks from town come out. People who'd never even seen or worn climbing shoes, ascend their first boulder problem. - My name is Brooklynn Potter, I'm Miss Emery County. This is so much fun, I'm having a ball, I've tried new shoes on, that's great. Oh my goodness. (group cheering) - You actually need to move your hips this way. - The festival was my first time rock climbing. I was terrified, I'm so scared of heights. - Retreat and then just gonna take the fall. - It was daunting. - Once you step up you'll feel a lot better. - Fudgy heck yeah. After that I was hooked. I got the bug bad (laughs). (crowd cheering) - Is this the line? - No, it's, jump right in. - Okay if you're gonna get a picture, you better friggin hurry. When I was their age, I would have got rid of all my fancy trucks and stuff. I coulda just come up here with one of them pads. (crowd cheering) You guys have fun. - We never wanted it to be just a climbing festival. We wanna show climbers from all around the world the local culture and flavor around here. - Yeah! - So they can kinda understand our way of life and why we love it so much here. - We started doin a clinic on how to make jerky. And you just wanna, real light, pepper makes everything better. - The jerky was so good last time that I'm back, even though I am a vegetarian. - I hope they keep coming back and look forward to meeting a whole bunch more. (crowd laughing) - For the grand finale of the festival, we had something special in mind. (National anthem playing) - They said, we're gonna do a rodeo. - [Commentator] Showing off their riding skills while the rock climbers compete in a number of fun contests. (commentator speaking faintly) (crowd cheering) - The rock climbers getting on steers, oh this is such a bad idea. The first boulderer I seen do it walked out in flip flops. - I'm wearing sandals this is unfair. - I thought, it's not gonna end well. - [Commentator] Let's get out and let's make some noise-- (commentator speaking covered by crowd cheering) Oh! No points. - The locals, they think these guys are nuts. (commentator speaking faintly) (crowd cheering) But it's one of the best events of the bouldering festival. - [Commentator] Oh! (crowd cheering) He's hanging on, squeezing those brakes. (crowd cheering) - The minute he opens his mouth he's lyin. - We're really glad to have you guys in the county at least somebody wants to come here. - You guys all come from anywhere you wanna come, we love bouldering. I hang on with these two fingers. - He fell off a boulder. - There's not a boulder I can't climb. - No, he fell off a boulder and hurt his shoulder. - Hit his shoulder. - Would you shut up. - Now climbing is part of town. The climbers fit in, they're welcomed in here. That change over, the acceptance of the climbing culture, its cool man, like there's a coffee shop now. - We grew up LDS Mormons and coffee and tea, you don't drink 'em. People would ask us, do you know where we could get a good cup of coffee? And we would always tell them, you have to go to Price, which is 30 miles north. We transformed the front room of our house into a little coffee shop for the climbers around here. They just keep coming back. - My favorite part is you become friends with people from all over the world. - I'm from Ecuador, got amazing people here that is really friendly. - Hola, I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. - Valencia, Espana. - My name is Christer, I'm from Norway. - Marseille, France. We had a good coffee and-- - Little tiny Orangeville, no name country town in the middle of no where. Tens of thousands of people come here, we counted 71 countries. (upbeat music) - It's really nice to have people from around the country and around the world bring that diversity into our community with different ideas. The rock climbers have made Emery County a better place. - You guys climbers? - [Cameraman] Yeah. - The people of our community, they know that our future's in bouldering, our future's in tourism. - I think one of the great things that's happened is that the local commissioners have gotten huge wilderness designation, like basically the entire San Rafael Swell. - The Emery County lands bill protects a million plus acres for climbers and outdoor enthusiasts. - Right now our country is so divided and the outdoor recreation is that point at which diverse people can agree on things and work together on it. - [Interviewer] What about Steven Jeffrey, he's-- - Moved. Steven Jeffrey just moved there. - Adriana and I became a part of this community through our festival and now we live here. - I love Orangeville and I do not wanna leave, ever. - Even as a mayor of Joe's Valley Bouldering now, I mean he's writing the guidebook and he's a local. I mean he loves that place you know. ♪ Oh lord I see what brings me here ♪ ♪ It's a mother to all my wandering ♪ - When I first started coming down here 25 years ago I was a scared little kid just looking for boulders to climb on. If anyone told me this is the place where I'd be settling down and livin, I would definitely think you were crazy but honestly I couldn't find a better place on Earth than Joe's Valley. ♪ And girls will come in first in clothes ♪ ♪ And the boys will wait a gazing ♪ ♪ And birds will sing from tops of trees ♪ ♪ And sunlight, falling angels ♪ When you're in the mountains on a big adventure it's an intense feeling to know that your safety and getting back down is completely reliant on yourself I mean, you just have to climb carefully Take it one step at a time The mountains are alive all around you and there's stuff that's beyond your control But one of the coolest feelings that a human can experience is to feel so small in a world that's so big Climbing for me is definitely about a lot more than just climbing It's more about the mental journey from beginning to end And everything that’s brought me to that point It's almost like my whole life’s leading me to a certain place (piano music) - [Alex] The Nose is 3000 feet of climbing, straight up the center of El Capitan. It's one of the most famous, historic routes in the world. The speed record on the nose has always been a series competition. The different climbing heroes breaking the record back and forth. I mean, climbing El Cap really quickly is pretty hardcore. - [Interviewer] Give me a brief history of speed climbing on The Nose. - A brief history of speed climbing on The Nose. (hammer clanging) The Nose was first climbed in 1958 by Warren Harding. It was the first rock climb of that scale that had ever been done and it took 40 days. Since then people have been trying to climb it faster and faster. Royal Robbins did it in a week. - The second the center of The Nose was a move on the Yosemite chess board, and who ever makes the best moves is going to win. - [Alex] Each generation writes its own history on The Nose. In the 80's, Peter Croft started pushing it faster. (dramatic music) - If I can do that fast then I've got the whole afternoon free to do something else. - [Alex] In the early 90's Hans Florine entered the scene and basically ushered in the modern era of speed climbing. (dramatic music) - Speed climbing The Nose is the ultimate expression of how competent a climber you are. To race up this 3000 foot wall in under three hours. You have to have the skills and endurance like a marathon runner. It is the most badass competition there is. Fastest time up the most incredible rock face in the world. I think this record will last for a good long time. - [Alex] All these incredibly talented climbers started to compete in that arena. Legendary figures like the Huber brothers. - And that should be clipped to the bottom belt? - Yup. - [Alex] More women got into the speed climbing game like Quinn Brett, Libby Sauter, Mayan Smith-Gobat. - It's pretty risky, you face some really big falls. (climbers chanting) - [Alex] Hans recruited Yuji Hirayama. - We're down to not just minutes, but to seconds. (group cheering) - The record went back and forth. We wanna one up each other, we wanna be number one. The whole strategy starts to become more extreme. At the boot I run out the entire back, just hold the rope with my hands as Sean swings across. Basically just less protection, bigger risks. - Oh dear, don't fall. Okay. - It's coming close to a certain limit. (climber screaming) - Just a barely increase there. - [Alex] In 2012 Dean Potter shaved a few seconds off the time and Hans had to hitch his wagon to a new horse. - I'd been looking around for somebody else I can team up with, I thought, Alex Honnald soloed half-dome let's pull him into the mix. - [Alex] I mean, Hans did literally write the book How To Speed Climb which I read and learned how to speed climb from so it was pretty exciting for me. I think the biggest take away was how systematically he approached the entire experience. I was wondering about that. You had to memorize all the moves, all the gear, you had to know what your partner's doing in the different places, you had to figure out all these different ways to refine things down as near to perfection as you can. (dramatic music) When you get to climb that well, it's so fun. Hans and I set a new record of two, 23, 46 and we were pretty satisfied with ourselves. Then after five years these two guys, Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds came along. - We're kind of the dirt bag monkeys. - [Alex] And they managed to break it. Which is pretty impressive. - When we topped out, you know I made a little Instagram post then and I got a text from Alex literally less than a minute after I'd made the post, like hey, congrats you know. A quick little, like hey, good job guys, all right, I'm calling Tommy. (both laughing) - In the past, you know the players, like the Hubers, frickin the Hans Florine, Yuji Hirayama, these are pros, these are like the best climbers in the world. And then Brad and Jim, the dark horses, I did not see that one coming that's for sure (laughs). (Jim laughing) I barely knew who they were, they just came outta nowhere and broke The Nose speed record. - [Interviewer] How many interviews have you done on camera before today? - Probably none, I've done no interviews on camera before (laughs). - See my vocabulary sucks so I'm always like, I start talkin and I'm like what the fuck am I saying? What am I trying to say? - [Tommy] They seem kind of goofy and fun. - Look at this, crispy, the pet squirrel. - They live kind of like derelicts. - All right, yeah, welcome to the place guys, step through the gate, watch your head on the skeleton. We got our stick walls, to give us a little bit of privacy. Do you wanna come inside? We've got basic supplies, the climbing gear, the cam shackles, the Beargrease. This is the finger board, it's good 'cause it's got big holds. These are the ones I grab onto. We've got this nice collage of all my friends I don't think I actually know any of those people but it's a nice collage. Dean Potter shows us the way. We follow in Deans footsteps. This is where we keep the katana, right here. This is, been in my family for at least a generation which I guess means, my brother gave it to me and yeah that's what we use to combat all evil. - [Interviewer] What kind of music do you listen too? - Mainly death metal, yup, the heavier, the faster, gets me stoked, makes me feel like life is epic 'cause life is epic. Got the heavy drums, the shreddin guitar, (heavy metal music) that's what you need, that's what you need right there. (heavy metal music) Welcome to the circle of power, this is where we come to focus our chi, not really, don't know any martial arts necessarily but know we're trying to get all centered and ready for The Nose. (heavy metal music) - Jim and I put in a lot of work, just that season, we climbed it 11 times. Trying to perfect that strategy just right to where we could shave off just a few minutes. Go by go we were running it out a little more, error back was getting thinner and thinner. For my half I made it to the top of Boots Leg which is 1500 feet up and I only placed three cams in that entire time. - [Interviewer] How safe was your ascent? - To say it's safe would be total lie, I mean it's not that safe. It's like it is definitely dangerous but we would try to make it as reckless as possible. Let me redo that. It's like, The Nose record is absolutely dangerous, there's no getting around that but the goal is to try to make it just-- God damn it I can't speak. What am I trying to say? The least amount of recklessness, yeah. Holy shit. On the record go, like a dumbass, I just forgot to drink water, I was like holy crap man I'm thirsty. I got up to the Dolt Tower and there's a party up there and I was like, can I have some water? - [Austin] Need coffee or anything? - No, do you have any water up there? - [Austin] Yeah lots. - [Brad] I was breathing super heavy and I'm trying to drink and I choked. - Just like coughed into their water bottle and gave it back (laughs). - I'm like, thank you. (Jim laughing) - The less you have, the better, because if you have nothing on you then you're light and free and you can climb really fast, just like being a runner you know, they got those little tiny shorts that they run with. Yeah I would go up there and I wouldn't wanna wear underwear 'cause it'd weigh me down to much (laughs). The closer we're getting to the record maybe we're pushing that boundary between dangerous and reckless just a little bit more. You're starting to wonder, can we just take a little bit more risk and get it finished so that we don't have to come back and take all that risk again? (dramatic music) - [Brad] Part of the strategy is that I need to be right on Jim's ass for that last pitch 'cause the time doesn't stop until I touch the tree. Yeah, I'm giving it everything I got. I'm just sticking my fingers through the hangers, I'm not clipping them with carabiners. - I heard that at the top Brad was literally just holding on with his fingers to the bolts and just plowing across and they had an entire 60 meter rope hanging between them but with nothing clipped and you're like what? Like what are you guys doing? - This one final bolt that I clipped just so that we're clipped into something but this time I'm like we're gonna break the record there's no time for anything. So I skip it and it's a little Dean Potter quote, "No gear, no falls". "No gear, no falls". Brad's down there just like monoing through the bolt hangers. - I was like, what does he mean? Like there's no gear? What? I remember pulling over to this one lip and I was like, yeah he's not joking, there's no gear between us. (heavy metal music) - Yeah man, come on! We got this! Come on Brad! Come on! Yeah man! - Cool. - Oh my God, we did it (Brads speech muffled by Jim) - When Brad and Jim took Alex's record, Alex started talking about recruiting me. - There aren't that many potential partners out there for speed climbing The Nose, there's just not that many people who can physically climb 3000 feet really fast. To me the most obvious choice is Tommy Caldwell. He's a really good trad climber, he's a really good granite climber, I mean my shoes are named after him so that's always a good sign. - Alex is the best climber for that style of rock climbing and so when two monkeys crawl outta the boulders and take his record, he's gotta team up with the other Titan of Yosemite rock climbing and show us how it's done but we'll see. - We'll see. (Jim laughs) - Yeah, we'll see. - You know there's a video clip of Brad and Jim climbing it. - Brad Gobright-- - When two aspiring amateurs dis you on the tally pull. - It was 2, 19, 44, I thought it was 2, 17, 44. - Oh yeah now it seems pretty obtainable. - Yeah. - Oh well, 2,19. Whoa, look how far he's swinging for the King Swing. (Tommy laughs) Look how much jumping he's doing, that can't be the way he actually did it, that's crazy. What a (speech muffled from food in Jims mouth) and his rope is just flossing across the ledge. - I like critiquing somebodies else's climbing while you sit and eat chips. (Tommy laughs) (chip crunching) I mean not to throw them under the bus but when you watch the time lapse of the two of them climbing The Nose in a couple minutes. I mean, it looks sketchy. - Oh man, he's really close. - Yeah, he's so close and I'm sure they don't have any gear clipped. I mean Brad's like 15 feet behind him. - Yeah. - I mean Brad could pass him right there if he wanted too. (Tommy laughs) Brad should have played through, I mean they have the whole 60 meter rope out with nothing clipped, it's just not the way we're gonna do it. - No (laughs). - That's crazy. - Alex had told me a couple times, he's like dude you guys are sketch up there, that seems really sketchy and I was like, yeah it's sketchy but that's why I've got the record and you don't. - The Nose speed record is one of the big games in climbing. I mean I've always been curious but yeah I always thought speed climbing was kinda dangerous and I've never been the danger guy but climbing with Alex, it's just so fun. Pretty much any time Alex says let's go do something I'm gonna say yes. He's my bad influence friend, absolutely. - How are you guys? How's the fam been? - Good, good, yeah the fam's so good these days. They don't like it when I leave, that part sucks but everything else is-- - It's a good thing you're only gone for a month huh? - Oh my gosh, are you gone for a month? - Well they're gonna come and hang. - Oh okay. - [Tommy] Wow, I get like shakey excited every time I come here still. Still happens, it's pretty rad. - [Alex] It's pretty exciting. - [Tommy] The last couple years, my life is so different, I've got two kids now, the Dawn Wall movie's coming out, I wrote a book and I've been flying all over the place doing events. I just haven't been able to get out and have these adventures but I crave it to my core. The whole game of racing the clock was totally new to me but I wanted to at least see what it was like. - [Austin] Who's wearing a helmet? - I'm wearing a helmet, first time for everything. - [Tommy] Wow you look weird in a helmet. - Okay I started our timer so, we need just a few tons of slack, don't worry about it. (dramatic music) Okay, I've actually got a piece in. Normally when you're climbing your partner is holding the rope and they're belaying you. (Tommy whistles) You stop, and you then you belay them up, you know, one and then the other and then the other. - Okay I'm climbing Alex. - If you wanna go faster, you can simul-climb, where you both climb simultaneously. When you're simul-climbing you definitely need a partner that you trust. Your partner should have a loop of slack out in front of them so that you have some freedom of movement as you climb and then they also have to manage all the extra slack hanging down below them. As the leader, you're placing gear wherever you want but if you fall off, you know that your partner is gonna catch you but you don't know if there's like a 10 foot loop of slack out or a 20 foot loop of slack. Basically it's hard to know what'll happen if you fall off. (dramatic music) So Tommy? - Yeah? - You can go a little slower Tommy 'cause there's only really the two anchors clipped between us. - Oh yeah, okay, just don't fall, got it. - When you speed climb The Nose, anything goes. Any combination of free climbing, aid climbing, cheating, you're stepping on bolts, you're pulling on gear if you need too. Total free for all. There's are always weird logistical snaffus or like things happen and you just have to deal with them. (dramatic music) - [Austin] How you doin? - Pretty good, yeah, been crash coursed back into the world of granite. - [Alex] I'm gonna start going up the bolt ladder and then the aid climbing so I'll be a little slower and you can kinda keep me a little tighter through this part, okay? - I got you tight. - [Alex] Okay, I'm on the boot. I'll just put you on belay and you should just climb this part casual style. (dramatic music) - Oh my God, dude Quinn fell so far. - [Alex] Dude. - Jesus. - [Alex] I know and as you climb this think about how weirdly slippery and kinda weird it is. (dramatic music) - Yeah it is kinda slick rock huh. - The main thing with speed climbing The Nose is that you shouldn't fall off, ever, but it's hard to fall off, it's 5.10 you never have to do any hard moves because you're cheating as much as you can, you're pulling on draws, you're stepping on bolts, it feels pretty comfortable. - I think sometimes Alex is just so, he is so confident in himself that he tends to just think that other people are as solid as he is but it's not the case. Our first run, I lead the last 500 feet. I was climbing along and I got to a place where I was like oh it's a little bit harder here, didn't realize it was wet. Falling! - [Alex] Whoa, are you okay? - [Tommy] I just slipped out of a wet crack. I had a piece of gear right at my feet and it felt like 50 or 60 feet. Falling! Wow I slipped out the wet crack. - [Alex] Whoa are you okay? - Yeah yeah, I'm fine. - [Alex] Whoa jeez. - [Tommy] What's that? - [Alex] I said oh jeez. - I just put in a piece luckily. - [Alex] Oh yeah, sweet. - Yeah sorry about that. - [Alex] No no, that's-- Sorry I had you kinda loose. - Okay Alex, can you pull it tight here? - [Alex] Okay, I got you good. - Thank you. - [Alex] Nice Tommy. - [Tommy] We climbed it in four and a half hours. - [Alex] Okay. - [Tommy] It was kinda mind blowing for me. That was fun though man. - Yeah that was really good. - It's gonna be a good workout. - [Alex] Yeah so are we thinking we'll climb The Nose again tomorrow? - I feel pretty good right now, I feel like we could. - I'm down if you're down. Tommy, he was surprisingly enthusiastic about it. Speed climbing kinda suits his schedule right now, I mean honestly he's in the middle of a book tour. - I was surprised, I feel shockingly-- - Good? - Right, yeah. - [Alex] It's definitely a good way to maximize the amount of climbing you do in a short amount of time. - Hey Tommy, say hi. - Hey, how you guys doin? - Are you climbing today? - Yeah we climbed El Cap already today. - Oh nice. - Which route did you climb? - The Nose. - Oh nice. Awesome. - Yup, just a little fitness lap. - I've got Alex's already. - Oh yeah? - Reel Rock L.A. - [Tommy] Nice. - [Male Fan] I totally understand man. - Are you guys getting on something this afternoon? - No, I'm getting in my bed. - Oh, okay, thanks. - [Interviewer] Tommy took a 50 foot whipper today. - Did he really? Are you serious? Fuck. He took a 50 foot whipper? Did you film it? You got it on film? Oh yeah. Money shot. Well there you go, even if you're a 5.15 climber the 5.10 cracks can still get you when you're speed climbing man. Maybe you're flying in the night before and you haven't climbed in Yosemite in a while so you decide to team up with Alex and sprint up The Nose. That's when you can take the whip, when you're in a 5.10 wet lie back. - Yeah but me and Brad, we spend a lot of time in Yosemite, we don't travel anywhere else. - I have yet to go on any book tours. - Yeah. - I'll fall anywhere doing the fastest-- - You're not supposed to fall ever. - Whoa, shit. - Maybe they've got a new strategy. - Wow. - Bringing more cams. - What-- - [Interviewer] They have a huge rack. - They have a huge rack yeah? - [Interviewer] Just to start. - Yeah, just to start, it'll get thinner. - Alex is like no dude, I swear it's safe, we can totally make it safe and then each time they go up there he'll probably like, just oops, we forgot the other point five (laughs). - Let's organize the rack so that, you may as well just organize it straight onto your harness so you're ready to leave tomorrow. - I've been really surprised by Alex's willingness to keep it a bit safer. - I feel like we should just start trimming down the rack a little bit as we go. - Although I'm already seeing that when we're going through our rack, he's like oh we can remove this piece, we can remove this piece, and I'm like, let's' not take that to far. - Let's drop the cam hook, screw that, maybe I'll leave these micronuts. - So we will maybe need to put another nut in the Great Roof tomorrow. - If it's this nut then I'm not gonna feel that much more secure anyway. (Tommy laughs) Do you wanna drop the green C three? - Yeah, sure. - Just take one thing off the harness. - Sure. - You're all wrapped up. - Yeah that's not horrible. That does feel heavy actually. - That's why we'll trim it down. - My wife isn't exactly stoked about this, everybody thinks it's pretty dangerous. With all the carnage in the past year on that route makes me hesitate a bit. - There have been a lot of semi-legendary falls on The Nose where people fall like 100 feet down the wall. I was climbing with Ueli Steck when he took a fall. - Oh shit. - [Alex] He's a little banged up and bleeding a little bit but he was basically fine. The Huber brothers, I think Thomas took some epic whipper off The Nose and then just a week ago, Hans Florine fell off and hit a ledge. - I'm pretty sure I've broken one or both my legs. - [Alex] Shattered both his heels. - [Nurse] Insert ice packs. - Ice and elevation baby, and rest. - [Alex] Hans has climbed The Nose like 109 times or something. - That's where I fell, right there. - [Alex] And then to just take a fall like that and break both his legs is pretty grim. - I think Hans' injury, the way that we climb I always thought that that kinda injury was a possibility. Breaking your legs you're gonna recover from that. - Road to recovery baby. - [Tommy] I feel like that risk is acceptable but six months ago Quinn Brett, a total badass, fell off of the top of Boot Flake and broke her back doin exactly what we're doin. - When Quinns accident happened, my emergency pager goes off and there's someone who needs to be rescued and it's one of our friends Quinn Brett who had just taken the most enormous fall you possibly could off of the Boot Flake doin the same tactic that Brad uses to get up there which is place no gear. She had gotten all the way to the end of the pitch, somehow slipped and then took the 100 foot fall and hit the Texas Flake and fell behind it. I was told that she was dead and that we were going to do a body recovery. We went up to get her down and then it turned out she was still alive and luckily they did an amazing helicopter rescue, got her off really quick but she had shattered her spine and probably would be paralyzed for the rest of her life. (dramatic music) - I'd climbed the nose 12 or 13 times. I did speed records on El Cap and through other formations in the Valley and in Zion and in Rocky. For me, speed climbing, I just really like moving. Covering terrain really quickly, you find yourself in what they call the flow state. Your moving, your moving, your brain is firing, your problem solving really quickly and your body is moving really efficiently. Had I summited that day, I would probably still be speed climbing. I mean it was a pretty awesome feeling until the moment I took a fall. - Quinn lives in my home town of Estes, see her all the time and you see how her life has changed and you're just like wow that's pretty heavy. So you know, I'm a father now, I can't really do things that are, you know I gotta keep my seam pretty buttoned up for the most part. (birds chirping) - [Alex] I remember my first time going up these ledges. - [Austin] Have fun guys. - [Tommy] See ya. - [Austin] Be safe. - [Alex] My first time going up these ledges it was like-- (dramatic music) - [Alex] So we got Jim here doing the rigging to help get the cameraman in place. How are we looking Jim? - They're looking pretty good. - [Alex] Yo Tommy, you in the Bolt Ladder? - Yeah I like ran outta draws basically. - It's a little strange to be up here watching the guys who are trying to break our record but I'm psyched to see their tactics and a little bit of heckling. Tommy's kinda botching it on the aid sequence. - They have fucking, cruxing out, hold on. - [Alex] What's that? - Cruxing out, my fault. - [Alex] I got you really tight. - Can you take for a second? - [Alex] Yeah, I gotcha. - I gotta work this part out. - [Alex] I placed a purple C three. - Yeah I couldn't quite reach it. - [Jim] Obviously Tommy free climbs like a mad man but to put it all out there for something like this is a little bit of a risk. - [Alex] You shoulda saved yourself one sling as an aider. - Yeah, I should have an aider, just remembered that. - [Alex] Gumby in. - The aid climbing fucks me up. - [Alex] Yeah it always does. - When I got up to the Boot Flake I was thinking about Quinn. I decided to put in a piece, even if it slowed us down, at least for now. - [Alex] I'm not sure if this is the best way but-- - Yeah I mean, we can tag it over. Oh God. - [Alex] I mean the thing is really Tommy should just solo the Boot but he just doesn't want to which I totally understand and respect but so in order for him to get the cure back means he has to lower it and it's just a little junk showy. - I'm good there, I don't know, where do you go to, you're at the King Swing right? - No no, I'm above it now. - Oh you are. - So yeah I'll just lower you down to me. Oh no wait, you just go back up and it'll lower me right? - Need to get you the gear though. - Yeah you can just drop it down the line. Oh, rack to the nuts. (Tommy laughs) Just the way I like it. - I was wondering if that was gonna happen. - Hi guys. - You. - [Austin] How fast were you guys to here on this go Tommy? - 1, 38. - [Austin] Nice. Jim, how long did it take you guys to get here? - We're not fully race pace yet and I think what-- - [Austin] 51 eh? - 51 minutes (laughs). - That seemed like, not quite right you know? - Yeah maybe not. - We kinda need to start going faster so we understand it. You know what I mean, like anybody could do a four and a half hour run on The Nose and be like that's cool. - Anybody. - Anybody. - Yeah anybody can (laughs). - [Austin] Anybody. - Doing like a two, 50 lap on The Nose is getting into some real, like that's fast. - Sweet, I'm honing in on being an elite level climber. - Yeah you're getting close. - Yeah (laughs). - I mean the Dawn Wall thing was pretty cool but it took 19 days. - Yeah (laughs). (dramatic music) - We kinda need the smaller rack, we need to drop a bunch of the cams. Droppin number two. - Yeah. Drop the jacket, drop the nuts, drop a grigri, I feel like we could drop a micro. - Okay. - Micro off the rack. Kinda wanna drop more cams. Like could we drop a one? - Uh. - Yeah. - That's not that many cams. - [Alex] Five a.m and we're about to go climb The Nose, third time in three days. - [Austin] So is this strategy similar to yesterday? - Yeah but less cams. - Fewer cams. - Fewer cams. (speech drowned out by laughter) - Make it a grammatically precise film. Perfection starts with our spoken word at the base of the root. (dramatic music) - The last couple days I've been flowing better and getting a little more fit. (dramatic music) I'd never realized how freaking fun speed climbing is. (dramatic music) Climbing El Cap in a couple of hours, that's unbelievable. It's just gotta be the coolest racetrack in the world. - [Austin] Ya'll went 16 minutes faster. - [Alex] Whoa buddy. - [Austin] We do the same split at the top, we'll be at three hours. - [Tommy] I'll do my best. - [Alex] I mean the real beauty of speed climbing, it's like approaching perfection. When you actually climb smoothly up the whole wall, there's no wasted movement, no wasted gear, no wasted time and you're in this perfectly choreographed dance with your partner. Tell me when it's fixed! It feels amazing. - [Tommy] It's crazy climbing with Alex honestly up there it's a whole new level. Like today he got kinda psyched and started to go fast and he was just running it out. - [Alex] When you're going speed style there are basically two options. You can simul-climb or you can short-fix. The leader gets to the anchor-- I'm tying it off. And then pulls up all the extra rope, ties the rope off to the anchor-- It's fixed! The second starts to ascend the rope. You just have 100 feet of rope laying there in a pile and you just start charging up the wall with no protection really. - [Tommy] Short fixing, whenever you fall as the leader you're looking at falling to the end of that 100 foot rope but Alex is willing to take the risk. He's so different in that way, like I've fallen 50 feet plus probably 10 times on El Cap or something. Alex never has. He doesn't wanna fall at all and he doesn't fall at all. - [Austin] What was your time? - Two, 57. - I'm feeling pretty encouraged at two, 57 because Alex climbed the route with his shoes looking like that and it was really wet and it was our third day in a row (laughs). - [Alex] It's just so ridiculous to be at the top of El Cap at nine in the morning. - I know, love that. - Some of these today felt like, less grueling then yesterday. - Yeah I totally agree. - Like I felt sorta tired and slow but yeah man it didn't feel-- I kinda think we can go sub-two dude. We'll see. (Tommy laughs) - That would be awesome, oh my God. Breaking this record, it feels possible I think but Alex really wants to do it in under two hours. It's gonna be hard. - I've always sort of had the life goal of climbing The Nose sub two hours, it seems possible but it seems kinda crazy, really hard. Kinda like it's a two hour marathon. It's a big psychological barrier. Going sub two, I think we'd be pretty proud but we'll see. (dramatic music) - Ready? Go. - [Alex] Started exactly six, 20 we are off to the races. - [Tommy] This time we pushed it a little bit harder. - [Alex] Nice Tommy. About to say, you're looking pretty good. - [Austin] Yeah. - By their fourth attempt Alex and Tommy were moving way faster, I was across the valley, filming with a telephoto lense. - [Stranger] You got a friend up there? - [Austin] Yeah they're trying to break the record. - [Stranger] Oh sweet, oh damn, who is it? - [Austin] It's Alex Honnald and Tommy Caldwell. - [Stranger] Oh okay, never heard of 'em. - [Austin] They're trying to make a name for themselves really. Tommy was cruisin, I mean I was having to like jostle and move around the camera a bunch just to try keep up with him. Oh nice here he goes, about to charge the Stove Legs. - [Tommy] I was getting a little too psyched up, like I was letting it get out of my comfort zone in terms of how fast I was going. - [Alex] Gonna have to untie and pull the rope through to undo one prusiks we do. So I had just taken the grigri off. - [Austin] Let's see, there he is. - [Tommy] And I just like slipped out. - [Austin] Holy shit. Dude Tommy just took a fucking monstrous whipper, like 100 feet. I'm like, I can't tell, he's climbing back up to Alex right now. It was like right when I was shifting the frame. - [Tommy] I just fell until I yanked against Alex who's tied into the other end of the rope. And then I just started climbing right away. - [Alex] Dude you whipped 100 feet, you were literally like oh I hate that I always do that and then you swung over and punched back through and I was like oh my God, that was outrageous. - [Austin] It's crazy, even with taking a huge fall, they're still gonna maybe go faster then they have before. - [Alex] After Tommy took his 100 footer, up higher on the route I slipped out of a crack while short fixed and probably would have taken a 50 or 60 footer but I caught the rope with my hands. I just don't really know, I don't really know what happened but I did rope burn my hand a little bit and tore a chunk out of a finger. (rope sliding against rock) (Alex breathing heavily) Yeah buddy! Nice work. Two, 31, that was a lot faster but really like not that cool, we kinda botched. - [Austin] Does it hurt? - Yeah I mean it burns, I mean it's like a huge open hole. On the other hand, I self arrest, I basically caught the rope and caught myself rather than take a hundred footer which is definitely a big plus. - Yeah we fell in the same spot. - Was that the exact same spot? - Yeah. - That's crazy. - Exact same spot. - That's crazy. - Dude it was at least a hundred feet. I was like, I'm still falling, I'm still falling, I was like I hope Alex didn't just untie and I just like fall to my death. I had time to think about all that. - Doesn't feel quite as fun today. - No it was minorly traumatizing. - We're broke now, we're kinda horrified. Man oh man, what a morning. - Yup. - It's a little horrifying too 'cause the people that are like watching today being like oh this is cool, and we're both like-- - I wonder if anybody was watching when I fell massively. - I know, I hope nobody saw that shit. - Yeah. (children speaking over each other) - From the outside. - Okay, I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you, who's calling? - [Youngest Child] Me. - Who is? Your calling? Hello? Hey how's it going? - Daddy! - Wanna say hi to daddy? - Hi daddy, hi daddy. - How fast did you climb today? - [Tommy On Phone] We climbed it in two hours and 31 minutes. - How'd it go today? - [Oldest Child] I wanna be a base jumper! - [Tommy On Phone] It was definitely slightly less than ideal. I took a really big fall and Alex also fell and grabbed the rope and tore a huge hole in his finger. - Awesome. Are you okay? - [Tommy On Phone] Yeah, yeah, I was safe. We've got it set up so we're only running it out where it's clean and stuff. So taking a big fall is, not that dangerous. - When Tommy mentioned the speed record, I wasn't really attracted to the idea. (Tommys speech muffled on phone) When Quinn had her accident and then Hans fell off The Nose it was just an eye opener, like oh man you can get really messed up but Tommy loves climbing with Alex, they're kind of unstoppable together and they truly believe it's safe. I don't know speed climbing very well but my understanding is like you guys are gonna climb fast and you have this dialed and you know what you're doing so you just don't fall but then they both fell in one day. Yeah. - [Tommy On Phone] But we're not gonna do that anymore. - Yeah but how do you avoid it? - After taking those falls, we felt like we needed to dial it back a little bit. - This is where I whipped the other day and Tommy whipped here. - [Tommy] Even Alex seemed a bit shaken up. - Gives the wrong impression of speed climbing. Ah, two, 51. - We didn't take any hundred foot falls today. - Yeah and no injuries. - Tommy and Alex, they're goin fast but there's such a difference between going three hours fast to breaking the record. - I think it might be possible to get there without redlining-- - They kinda gotta get it together pretty quick here I mean it's mid May and if it drags on into June, it gets hot and it gets crowded. - [Alex] Don't let it go. - The Nose has just become so incredible popular, everyone wants to do The Nose. So you just get people from all over the world. It's packed. - Wouldn't be The Nose if we weren't jocking for position. - [Austin] Get out of the way. - [Brad] The wall climbers come up and it gets frustrating passing five to 10 parties. (speaking foreign language) - Go Tommy go! - Gracias. - Kinda smells, reminds me of urine. Welcome to The Nose huh. - It really is kind of a challenge to try to not get stuck behind people. The strategy is, you don't ask to pass but you're really friendly, you're like what's up guys? Oh you're from Germany, sick, cool, yeah, is it your first time out here? And you're talking to them the whole time and meanwhile you're just kinda slowly climbing through their junction, before they know you're above 'em and you're like all right guys, have fun, good luck and you just keep climbing. (speaking foreign language) - Thanks man. Where are you from? - Netherlands. - Have fun. - You too. - What was the time? - Two, 25. - Two, 25. - [Austin] Two, 25? - Yeah. - [Austin] Damn. - Two, 25 is pretty good. Should we go down and eat a sandwich? Let's go see your kids. - I know, my kids! - I haven't seen your family yet. (young girl speaking gibberish) - Hi (laughs). - Hey pits. - Hey baby. - Hey how's it going? - Good, you remember me? - I do, how you feeling? - Good, did you watch us at all? - [Rebecca] Think I saw you towards the top. - [Brad] How's it going? - [Tommy] Oh yeah, Brad. - Did you guys do The Nose? - Our time today was two, 25. - What was your time? - Five minutes away, yeah. (dramatic music) - [Tommy] So what are we doin? Are we goin all? - Let's go fast, yeah. - Go fast, let's feel the burn. (birds chirping) - We gotta make sure they start at the exact same foot of the root that we start at. Making sure all the clocks work. - Seems like they might break the record but we'll see, it's a little hot and there's some parties on the wall so it might be a little more difficult today. When me and Brad were going for it we were nervous, like oh boy this is gonna be stressful. Today, yeah these guys are the ones with all the stress. - Oh we don't have any stress. - We just get to chill and watch. That's good. - Did you guys start from this pedestal or that one? - Brad would monkey up this way. - It kinda makes more sense to start right here and just bam, bam, bam. - I mean you're the professional (laughs). - Okay, ready? - Go. (dramatic music) - [Alex] Remember the Hans saying, start out slow, go, go, go, start out fast, just won't last. - And there they go, history begins. (dramatic music) (speech muffled by wind) - [Jim] Taking the swing. - [Brad] Oh yeah. (Jim cheering) (dramatic music) ♪ Clock started, nothing left but tie me down ♪ (dramatic music) - All right Tommy, tell me when you get to that piece and I'll swing over. - Okay man. ♪ We can call the whole thing, down ♪ - [Alex] Nice work Tommy. - [Tommy] Thank you. - Tommy and Alex left all their gear at the base so we're bootying it (laughs). They don't need it, they get free stuff but me, I work and steal for my living (laughs). - Let's see what their time is. - They did really fast on the sickle bit. - They're at 30, almost 38 minutes. - [Austin] That morning there was an audience. Becca was there with Alex's girlfriend Sanni. - Go daddy! - I think he heard you. - They got Hans sitting out there, broken ankles and all. (Hans cheering) (Brad booing) And Brad and Jim, secretly hoping that they'd watch them make a bunch of mistakes. Is there a part of you guys, like I hope they stubbied? - No. - Yeah. - I don't think so. (both laughing) - Do you see daddy? Do you see daddy in there? - Fit in the boot. - [Rebecca And Sonni] He's on the boot (laughs) - Do you know where the boot is kids? You can see a perfect little boot up there. - [Tommy] The Boot Flake is always an exciting moment. - [Alex] Yeah this is my favorite pitch. - [Tommy] Yeah. - [Alex] Yeah. - [Tommy] It's like my least favorite pitch. Just get grip, thinking about quitting when I'm up there. (slow dramatic music) - [Jim] Tommy places a cam on the boot. - [Brad] Oh yup, there he goes. - What is he doing? I bet that makes Becca happy. - Yup. - [Rebecca] Give it to me kiddo, daddy's standing on the boot. (spectators cheering) - [Jim] He lowers down to grab it before Alex does the swing. That's definitely a time waster right there. - [Brad] Yeah. - Okay here we go. - [Tommy] We've been checking the time after Alex does the King Swing, it was an hour and one minute. - [Alex] We were five minutes faster than before. I just knew it was game on, it was time to go as fast as I could. - Oh man they got someone starting up the Great Roof in a minute, might get hosed. - When I was getting up to the Great Roof, these two Bask women who we passed twice before in the week had just finished aid climbing the pitch and so there was already rope hanging down it and gear all over it. (speaking foreign language) It's mildly annoying when you can't put your fingers into the places you want but it means that I can just pull on their quick draws and just climb through. - [Foreign Woman] Go Alex go! (speaking foreign language) - [Tommy] What's that? - Watch me good here. (speaking foreign language) Got the lines fixed Tommy! - [Tommy] Alex gets to the anchor, short fixes there and then I just jug as fast as I can. (speaking foreign language) - When I got to the Great Roof, we're right on pace for the record but then I just start getting tangled in the equipment from the Bask ladies. - [Foreign Woman] Go Tommy go! - I have to switch my whole system. Putting jumars on, taking 'em off, figuring out where to put 'em, there's this other rope, I'm worried it's gonna get stuck, just clustering. Oh fuck. I lowered out and then I went to pull the loop but it was just caught. The only quick solution I could think of was to untie and pull the rope as fast as I could and then tie back in. Alex had gotten stopped because he didn't have any rope left he's just kinda like waiting for me right in the middle of the cruxxed out pitch. - [Tommy] Something got twisted in that anchor I have to untie. - [Alex] Sorry about that. No, it's not your fault. - What's going on? - You know where they're at Hans? - Alex is right where I fell. - So I pull my end then I just start trying to tie back in. (dramatic music) - [Alex] Every time you speed climb The Nose you run into situations that you haven't necessarily dealt with before there's always some kind of weird thing and the real test is how quickly you can deal with it and manage and then just keep moving forward. It was definitely the right call for Tommy just to look at, be like oh here's what I need to do, untie, pull, pull, pull, retie, here we go, keep going. It's like, good improvising by Tommy. (dramatic music) - Oh shit. (dramatic music) - [Alex] Nice work, way to deal. - Okay, adios. - Okay, adios. - [Tommy] That probably wasted two minutes. - [Austin] Look at him go. - [Tommy] But you know Alex just started to boogey up the steep cracks at the top like nobody else ever had. Climbing like a beast in no fall terrain and we made up tons of time there. - [Alex] On each of the last six pitches I have positions where I could probably take a hundred to a 200 foot fall. So I didn't look at any splits or anything you don't really wanna think about pace to much you wanna just go as hard as you can and just execute. Just focus on what we're doing and then just find out on top. - [Brad] Shit dude he is just fucking-- - Wow it's amazing. - Tommy's at the Wild Stance, Alex is on the final Bolt Ladder. - [Alex] The last pitch is like the full glorious sprint to the finish line. It's completely exposed, totally outrageous. You're hand over handing bolts, you're like (grunts), just leave it all on the table, punch it to the top. It feels so heroic. (spectators cheering) - Can't tell me, I'm running to the top, get some! (spectators cheering) - I wasn't checking my watch at all I was just trying to go as fast as I physically can. - [Alex] I'm just running uphill with a bunch of weight hanging off me and then the goal is just to pull the rope as tight as you can and then start pulling on Tommy. Yo Tommy! (Alex breathing heavily) Come on Tommy! - I see him, he's pulling, hand over handing. - [Rebecca] Let me see. - [Sanni] Come on Tommy! - The tree is in sight, I'm just, I'm running up the final slabs as fast as I can. - [Alex] Come on Tommy! - All of a sudden I just get jerked to a halt. I just started panicking, I was like, oh no! - [Alex] Come on Tommy! - And again I had to friggin untie the rope and it probably took me like two or three times as long to untie as it should have. - [Alex] Come on Tommy! - Finally got it untied and ran to the tree. - [Alex] Yeah buddy! - [Austin] When Tommy ran up to the tree without the rope I was like that's unorthodox. - [Alex] Did you just untie at the end? - Yeah my rope got caught. - [Alex] Well, good call - I didn't even really realize what had happened. Alex just kind of casually walks back. Two, 10, 14. - Two, 10, 14. (spectators cheering) - Hi daddy! - Say good job daddy! He's standing on top. - Well man, nice dude. - boom. That felt good. - Yeah, yeah. - It still wasn't quite perfect though. - Yeah, I was like- - Got stuck several times and that was kinda like uh. - That was good though, we got the record. - You got it back! - Nice work. That was sick. - Yeah, we got it by, kind of a lot. - Almost 10 minutes. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, legit. Now we just gotta shave 10 more. - Oh Jesus. - That definitely hurt a lot more. (gentle music) Breaking somebodies record is fun, it's nice to one up your friends or whatever. Brad's calling. - [Tommy] Oh nice. - Brad Gobright. - Congratulations, you did it! - Yo, we took it, we took it, but not quite by enough for it to be out of the question for you guys though you know? We might have to go again. But the idea is that you're seeking out that feeling of perfection where they're like, this climb went as well as any climb can go and so when we got to the top in two, 10, we're like oh that felt really good and we did it pretty quickly but it wasn't quite perfect. - Yeah I think both of us were immediately like, oh we can do better than that, we're not done with this. Does seem possible to go faster. - Yeah I mean we could for sure shave 10 minutes off that. - I feel like we're just getting close to our potential at this point so that two hour mark is very enticing. We just decided that we should keep going, try and do it in under two hours. - You know I think any reasonable person would break The Nose speed record and hang up their rack and they'd be done but Tommy and Alex they wanted to break two hours. It's kind of this mythical time that people have wondered about like, oh is it even possible? - My thought is that if we break two hours that'll be getting pretty close to this is perfect, like this is the best that we can do. - It's gonna be real hard, like this is gonna hurt but we're gonna try again tomorrow and who knows? Maybe we'll just cut off another 10 minutes. - [Austin] Yeah fellas! - Yeah! Hey, what's happening? How's it goin buddy? - The baby's sleeping. - Oh sorry. - But you did good, nice job. - Yo Hans, what happened? (everyone laughing) - Don't insult the history book here. Seven hour, six hour, and five hour mark all broken by Peter Croft and Dave Schultz. Dean Potter and Timmy O'Neill broke the four hour mark, Yuji and Hans broke the three hour mark, Alex hasn't broken an hour marks, oh that's gotta hurt. (all laughing) - That's fair, yeah. - [Tommy] So yeah, go again tomorrow? - [Alex] Yeah. - Two experienced climbers died when they plummeted off El Capitan in Yosemite this morning. - [Female Reporter] The two climbers were attempting El Cap when something went horribly wrong. The climbers, identified as 46 year old Jason Wells of Boulder, Colorado and 42 year, a Tim Klein from Palmdale. Rangers still figuring out just how these climbers fell Saturday. - [Alex] The next morning we were getting ready for another attempt on The Nose and we found out there was an accident on El Cap. Two super experienced climbers, Jason and Tim, they were using speed climbing tactics on another route call the Salathe which is just to the left of The Nose. It's unclear exactly what happened but somehow fell off the wall. It was like, woof, pretty heavy. An accident like this, is you never know if maybe they did have gear and maybe it pulled or maybe a rock rolled, cut the rope, you know what I mean, there's so many variables. I mean it definitely makes you pause and think about your choices a little bit. - Are you guys thinking you're gonna climb tomorrow? - I don't know. But the reality is, if you're speed climbing on The Nose you've already thought about how an accident could occur, what it would be like to fall off. You're already doing your absolute best to minimize the chance of that happening. - Like there's always an anchor, we're always at least-- - [Alex] I think that for Tommy the bigger challenge is his obligation to his family and making sure the Becca feels comfortable with his decision making. - It's just the kind of thing where it's like I want a guarantee but there's no guarantee so I just have to trust you guys but that's scary. - I was feeling a little bit wigged about just raging tomorrow. - Yeah making sure there's no gear-- - Maybe take a second look at those fixings. So we decided to go and take it a little more chill. Mostly to just test out the psyche. To go sub two I feel like you just gotta be like, (grunts) so stoked and this definitely took the wind out of the sails for me. We went back up, taking the time to reanalyze everything. It felt really solid to me, it felt safe. It's just a question of how to go faster. The one place I know I can save some time is the Boot Flake. We'll go faster if I just skip that piece. (birds chirping) But that's a line I'm just not willing to cross. (slow dramatic music) Yeah I thought that was fun today, I didn't feel wigged, it felt super fun. - That was so fun. I'm glad that we retouched all the safety stuff I think it's totally fine. - Yeah. - So I would have to shave another five off the bottom? - [Alex] Yeah. - The last piece of the puzzle was how to go faster on that bottom section. I set up a self belay, rehearsed every move so that I could it totally flawlessly. If I can shave that five minutes, I'd be holding up my end of the bargain. - Good morning. - [Other Climbers] Good morning. - [Rock Climber] Congratulations. - Oh thanks. Goin again today. - Let's say today is gonna be a little less casual. (birds chirping) - [Alex] Nice and relaxed. - [Tommy] Okay ready. - [Alex] Yup. (watch beeps) (dramatic music) - [Alex] Whoa Tommy. (dramatic music) Tommy was charging to Sickle. I mean most people spend the whole day getting to Sickle. Wow, 11, 06. - [Tommy] Holy shit. - [Alex] And there goes Tommy blitzing to Sickle in 11 minutes, it's completely outrageous. Get it, get it, get it. (dramatic music) (music drowns out speech) - [Alex] Where you guys from? (music drowns out speech) - [Tommy] I'm on the Bolt! - [Alex] Okay I have you on set. You're on normal belay. (music drowns out speech) - [Alex] Man that was really fast, 56. - [Tommy] Wow, five minutes faster. - [Alex] Nice work! Okay your line's fixed! Tommy puts in an amazing effort and puts us in a position to succeed and I'm obligated to do my best to see us through to the end. (dramatic music) - [Tommy] Yeah AleX! Crushing dude! (dramatic music) Alex is rocketing up these steep amazing pitches 2500 feet off the ground. God he's just so in his element. Seeing him climbing with absolute grace and confidence I mean that's perfection. (hooks rattling) (hook clipping) (hooks rattling) Yeah Alex! - [Alex] All right, fixed. - [Tommy] Climbing with him up there I get to not only witness but to be part of that mastery. - [Alex] I'm on top Tommy! - [Tommy] Okay! And do something together, it feels, transcendent. - Come on Tommy! Come on, go fast! Yeah Tommy come on! (Tommy breathing heavily) Yeah, yeah Tommy! - We do it? - [Alex] Oh yeah. (Tommy cheers) - Oh my God. Oh my God. (Tommy breathing heavily) (Tommy grunts) - What do we got? - I'll come show you. (Tommy grunts) - Oh that was so sick dude. Good work. - Fuck yeah. Yeah! Dude, one, 58, one, 58, 07. - Whoa! - Yeah! - Killed it! Yeah, sick. - Sick. - Wow beat it by two minutes. - Yeah, let's never do this again. (Tommy laughs) - Good work dude, you were charging. I actually smelled burning rubber at one point and I was like that's appropriate. - [Rebecca On Phone] Hello? - Hey baby. - [Rebecca On Phone] You did it! - We did it! - [Rebecca On Phone] Come on, are you guys psyched? - Yeah. - The thing is 'cause if we kept goin forever I bet we could go to like one, 45 or something but-- - Oh God, that sounds real painful. - [Rebecca On Phone] We don't need to do that. - Yeah no I don't wanna do that. - Alex said he felt emotional when he felt the timer. - [Rebecca On Phone] Are you gonna cry Alex? - No no, the feeling has past, I already feel like we kinda sucked and we should of done better. - [Tommy] Yeah. - [Rebecca On Phone] Well I'd be crying if you guys didn't do it right now. (both laughing) - Yup. - [Tommy] Yo Hans. - [Hans On Phone] Congratulations guys. - [Alex] Oh you saw it? - Thank you. - Yeah thanks. - Pretty exciting huh? - [Hans On Phone] Are you guys done? - [Both In Unison] Yeah we're done, we're good. - One, 58, 07, we're calling it good. - Yeah yeah, I'm psyched with that. - [Hans On Phone] Hold on, hold on. One, 58, 07 right? - Yup yup. - [Hans On Phone] Okay that's the official time that we'll go with. - Yeah that's the official time. You can go ahead and etch that into stone, that's the official time. (dramatic music) - That probably knocks Brad and Jim out of the game. (Tommy laughs) - That was the goal all along. - Yeah exactly. Come on who cares about breaking two, let's just break Brads spirit. (Tommy laughs) Just kidding Brad. (Tommy laughs) (slow music)
