- Hey, whoa, whoa, hey. Wait, no, no, easy. Easy. Hey, I'm Detective Amy Walker. I just spoke to your doctor. I know you can't talk now, but you will. Can you write? Can you write your name for me? I'm here to help you, okay? Please, tell me your name. Layla. Layla. What's your last name? Where are you from? Where have you been living? - My mustang. Whoa, whoa, please breathe. Breathe. - All right, all right, all right, all right, this interview is over. You out the way, move, move, move. Calm down. Breathe. Breathe. Get out. Layla, Christian, get over here! What is it, Mom? - You guys are going out too far and I can't see you. Layla, hand me that diaper bag. Goodness. - You promised to read to me. - I know, honey, but it's getting late, and we should be going home. - Please, just a little longer? - I can't keep my eye on both of you running in different places. - But we haven't even got our ice cream yet. You promised, Mommy. - I did, didn't I? All right. Here's $5. When the ice cream man comes, you get ice cream and you come straight back so we can go home, okay? - Okay. - All right. Straight back. And stay where I can see you! - Ice cream! - Ice cream! Yay! Oh, I want that one. - What type do you want? Ooh, I want that one too. Come on. Oh, that one looks good. - This looks delicious. Yummy. These are so delicious. - Wow. - Mm. Oh, this is so good. Ooh, you're gonna be in trouble. - But it wasn't my fault. Go to the bathroom and wash up. - But my ice cream. Go! - Are you okay? - I can't find my dog. - I can help you look for him. You would? You shouldn't. - Why? - I don't know where to look. - What's your name? Tina. - I'm Layla. Don't cry, okay? I'll help you find your dog. - There he is! - Where?! - He's under the car. He looks scared. - I don't see him. - You're smaller than me. Can you see him? I don't. - You did good, baby. You did real good. - I thought you might be hungry. You like pizza? You've not got anything to be afraid of. I'm your friend. I'm Ricky. - I want my mommy. - I know. It'll get better with time. - Please take me home. - This is your home. We're gonna be your new family now. You'll like it here. No school, you get nice things and don't have to share them. Now, eat up. Pizza and ice cream taste good, don't they? Well, now, your job is to make me and my friends feel good. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. You're a good girl, Layla. Are you ready to meet your sisters? Should I let them in? Girls, this is your new sister, Layla. Layla, this is Kim, Gina, and Bee Bee. You've already met Tina. This is Donny. - How you doing, baby? Why don't we give you guys a chance to know each other better, while we step outside and talk? - How do we get out of here? - You can't. I know it might seem scary, but that's 'cause it's new. - I hate you! I hate you for bringing me here! - Stop! - Stop! I hate you, I hate you! - Let go of each other! - Stop! Your behavior, intolerant in this house. I'm gonna teach you a lesson. Come here. Come here! You're gonna learn real quick that I don't tolerate disobedient behavior. So I don't ever want to see you causing any more pain to your sisters ever again. Or I'll make things worse! Much worse! You're so beautiful. They're gonna love you so much. Did I say you could get dressed?! When you pick a fight with the devil, the devil always wins. - I brought you breakfast. You okay? When they first brought me, I tried to run away too. - But don't you miss your home? - Sometimes, but my mom and dad stopped caring about me a long time ago. Donny found me in the car. Dad said he'd be right back, but he didn't come back. It isn't that bad. We all take care of each other. And the guys bring you presents. - What guys? - Donny and Ricky's friends. They give you stuff. And you have friends, like me, Gina, Kim, and even Tina. - I hate Tina. - Don't hate her. It's not her fault. Donny and Ricky pick out who to add to our family. - But why me? - Hey. I came to ask you some more questions today. I had your handwriting examined. Found some interesting things. When's the last time you went to school, Layla? I'm gonna ask you some yes or no questions, and all I need you to do is move your head. The more time we lose on this, the colder the trail will be to catch whoever did this to you. Were you living with a family member? Were you abducted? Kidnapped? Was it by someone you knew? How long have you been gone, Layla? Use your fingers. Seven. Seven months? Years? This is a really pretty bracelet. Detective, a word? - I'll be back later to check on you. - You look like a princess. All done. - My mommy never let me wear makeup. - Look at you. Aren't you beautiful? Layla, I just complimented you. What do you say? - Thank you. I heard the guys are bringing you candy and ice cream today. Really? - Give me a moment alone with Layla, okay, Bee Bee? Come up here, baby. You've got to be the prettiest girl in the world, you know that? I know you've only been here a few weeks, but today's a very special day for you. You get to meet some of my friends. - Bee Bee told me. - Well, make them happy, all right? Just like you make me and Ricky happy. - No penetration. Understand? Layla, say hello to Mike. Play nice. - I'm kinda shy around you 'cause I've never been with a black woman before. You smell like candy. You like candy? I like candy too. I got you some candy. I wanna kiss you now. Don't scream, don't be mean to me. I don't wanna hurt you. I'll be nice. You gotta stop crying. It's okay. It's okay. I only wanna touch you. - Here, let me help you. Layla, why don't you tell me how you met John Marley? You love him? - I love clouds. Before my grandma died, she told me she'd watch over me while sitting on a cloud. - Like an angel? - Yeah. Sometimes, I look at them and try to guess which is her cloud. You okay? - Yeah... - Layla. Grab me a beer. - Tina, get out. Get out! I have a lot of love for Tina. - Bee Bee says you're Tina's brother. - Si. I've been looking out for her since she was a baby. And sometimes, she takes care of me too. - My brother would never do to me what you did to Tina. - Aw, Layla. Now, you're a too. Don't you forget that, eh? You know what a mustang is? It's a wild horse. Men try to break it so they can control it, but the horse, the horse is stubborn, smart, incredibly beautiful. You're my mustang, Layla. - Can I go back out to Bee Bee now? - Sure. - Hello? Hello? - Help! - There anyone home? - Say one fucking word and I'll put a bullet in his head. - Hello? Are you selling the home? - Come on. Let's go! Stay in there until you realize nobody cares about you outside this family. Ready to accept us as your home now? - No, I wanna go home! - Accept your family now? - You're not my family. No, please, I'm thirsty! You done fighting now? You okay? You have to stop fighting him. You're only making it worse. Ricky and Donny care about us. - You don't hurt people you care about. - One time, this guy took Kim and hurt her real bad. Ricky saved her. Ricky can get mean, but he's not all bad. He said you tried to leave us. I'd be sad if you left. - Are you new here? I've never seen you before. Hey. She's mine. - What's going on? - I called her first. - You gotta wait. - I want this one. To myself. For the night. - But I called her first! - All right. Green speaks louder than words, hombre. - Girls, why don't you show our friends to your rooms? - So... Well, I haven't done anything like this before, so... What should we do? Can I sit with you? How old are you? - 10. - What kind of stuff do you like to do? - Be with Bee Bee. - Well, who's Bee Bee? - My friend downstairs. I like poetry. - Oh, really, like... Well, like Dr. Seuss or... - No. Like Maya Angelou. - Oh. Well. - Why did you want to be with me all night? - Oh, well... You didn't seem to want to be with that other guy. - Please don't hurt me. - Well, I would never hurt anybody. Why would you ask something like that? - I've been hurt before. - Well, I won't hurt you. What's your name? - Layla. - Layla. Well, I'm John. Do you think that you could smile for some pictures for me? - Like a model? - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's nice. He was different. - Different how? - He just wanted to talk and take my picture. - A lot of Donny's friends like taking pictures. What did you talk about? - Poetry. He said he'd bring me some. We talked about you, how you're my best friend. What are you doing? - Talking. What are you talking about? - None of your business. I know what you're doing. Hey, what's going on? She's talking about running away. - I am not! - That's not true, Donny. - And she's probably in on it too! - You trying to run away? - I never said that! - Layla, I want you, now. - See, I told you... - Tina, words don't mean anything. You always need evidence. - What happened with you and that guy last night? He likes you. Said he's coming back tonight. - Really? - Why are you so happy? - He was nice. - You're mine, you know? I'm gonna be your first love. What do you want?! We're talking! - I need to talk to Layla. - Wait your turn! I'll be done soon. Soon, it'll be just the two of us. And you're gonna get real pretty for me, right? Right. Good girl. - I'm sorry about earlier. You and Bee Bee seem so close and I felt left out. Are we okay? - Yeah. - Do you guys wanna play? Bee Bee, Kim, and I are gonna do each other's makeup and hair. - Sure. - You coming Tina? - In a minute. - We ran some tests. We found three other men's DNA from you that we matched in our system. Were any of these men the man that tried to kill you? You wanna keep it? Okay. Hey, you get some rest. I'll be back later, okay? - Fuck! Fuck! Bitch. Fuck! - Bee Bee, can you braid my hair? - Wanting to impress your boyfriend? - He's not my boyfriend. I just wanna look nice, that's all. - Last night, Donny's friend watched me eat candy naked. - That's so weird. - Ricky, don't hurt her! - Ricky, stop! - Shut up! - Ricky, chill out, man. She's just a fucking kid. - No, this one wants to be an adult, so I'll fucking treat her like one! - Ricky, please, I didn't do anything! - You don't steal from family. You come in here and you bewitch me into thinking you're innocent. We both know you're not! Fuck! Let me go! Shh. I will break you. - I wanna spend some time with that cute little black girl I had my eye on yesterday. - Sorry, she ain't feeling too well tonight. - I brought $2,000. You give me the one I want, and it's yours. - Look, I'll be straight with you. Little bitch mouthed off, so I had to teach her a lesson. She's not looking too pretty right now. What about the cute girl over here? She's a real people pleaser. Very sweet. How old? - 11. - You let me do whatever I want with her, we have a deal. - Whatever you want is worth way more than two grand, hombre. - How's four? - Hey. Money first. Have fun. - Hey, I gotta take a piss. - Down the hall, to the right. - Hey. What happened? - Ricky thought I stole money. - I knew something didn't feel right. - Please don't leave me. You brought poetry. - Yeah, I did. I'm a man of my word. - What do you wanna play? - How about cops and robbers? - Can't we dance instead? - No, we're gonna do what I wanna do. Don't scream! No screaming! You'll only make it worse. - I can't let them hurt you again. Come with me. - He won't let me go. What are you doing? - This is my phone number. I want you to take it. - But Donny and Ricky don't even let us near their phones. - Look, just take it. All right, now, if you ever need me, you just call me. - What are you doing here? Bee Bee? Bee Bee? - What the hell's going on?! - Hey, go back to your rooms! And you get the fuck out! Open up! Donny! - Bee Bee? - You don't need to see this. Fuck! - Hey. - I'm here. - I'm cold. - Bee Bee, you have to stay awake. - I can't. I'm scared. - Don't be. I'm not gonna let anyone else hurt you ever again. I'm not leaving your side. - Motherfucker just sped off before I could catch him. - Gotta get outta here right now. - Where? - Don't matter. Some place else. I'll get the girls packed, you stay here. - Why the fuck am I staying? - 'Cause I fucking told you to. - Layla, go back to your room. Layla. - I'm not leaving her. - She won't let her go. - Layla, go pack your things. - No. - Layla, go pack your clothing now. - I'm not going. - Get your shit, Donny. I got this. You gotta let her go,. She's gone. - She's here. - Layla, I'm starting to lose my patience. Go pack! - No. I'm not leaving! Bee Bee! Wait, no! Bee Bee! No! No! No! - Come on! Let go! No! Bee Bee! Get this off. I'm gonna let that slide since your friend just died. - She's not dead! - She is! The sooner you realize that, the better off you'll be. - It's your fault! - My fault? You should be thanking me, baby. That guy wanted you. Got his way, it'd be you lying dead. - I wish I was! I hate you! - Like it or not, we're all you have. You can either accept that or you spend a very long time lonely and alone. We leave in half an hour. Rinse off her blood. - Layla, you packed? Where's Bee Bee? - We can't do this right now. We gotta go. Where is she? - You should keep that. She'd want you to have it. It'll be like keeping her with you. That way, you never let nobody go. Now, come on, it's time to start over. - Hold her down! Hold her! All right, calm down, calm down. It's gonna be okay, calm down. Calm. Calm. Hold her! Okay, you're okay. There we go. There we go. Okay. Poor girl. Can't stay asleep without being haunted by someone. - I've been gone a couple days because your doctor thought it'd be best to give you some time to recuperate and heal. I know you can talk to me now, Layla. You don't have to do this to yourself. You don't have to suffer in silence. - Where's Bee Bee? - Who's Bee Bee? Hey. Who did this to you? Where were you being held? - I don't remember much. I don't want to remember. Find Bee Bee. You have to find her. - You remember how to do this? - I wanna do this. - Ricky said it's my turn. - And Ricky said I'm his mustang. - He said I gotta choose our new sister. You want this, Layla? - I wanna find a girl like Bee Bee. - All right. This one's yours, Layla. - Don't leave us. - Hey. Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Are you here with your mom or your dad? - I'm not allowed to talk to strangers. - Can I swing with you? I'm Amanda. What's your name? - Layla. - Why were you crying? - I wasn't. - The big kids are mean to me too. We can be friends and play together. - I can't be your friend. - Why not? - Because. - Because why? - Just 'cause. Now, go away. People who are my friends, they get hurt. - Why do they get hurt? - They just do. Now, go. But I thought we can play together. - Stop following me. I mean it! Go! He's gonna kill you! You little! You wanted her to get away. We coulda had her! You're gonna regret what you just did when I'm through with you. - Layla, I brought you some food. You haven't eaten all day. Layla, please. I know you miss Bee Bee. I do too. - I couldn't let him hurt her. I wish he killed me. - I'm glad he didn't. You are brave for all of us. All we have is each other. - Out, Gina. I need some time alone to tame my mustang. - I'll talk to you soon. - Who's Ricky? - A monster! As we got older, Ricky would give us this stuff before the guys came. Made everything foggy. He didn't like us putting up a fight. - He drugged you? - Helped us forget what we didn't want to remember. - What are you doing? Thought I'd join you. - Did I invite you? No, but... - Then why, go sit with the other girls, then. But I... - Get out! This is all your fault! - You're gonna disrespect my woman like that, huh? Ricky,. - I don't know why I still have you here anymore. You're old. Too old. Nobody wants you anymore. If they wanted to fuck a whore, they could easily go down to the corner. - Ricky, I love you. - You're dried up. Get out. You hear me? Get the fuck out! Nobody talks about my girl like that. Hello? - Is this John? Yes, who's this? - When I was a little girl, you gave me your number and told me to call you if I ever needed anything. Layla? Oh, my God, where are you? You disappeared after that night. - Downtown LA. Los Angeles? Where? - I'm in a building. It's big with only a few windows. Is there anything else in the room that you can tell me that'll help me know where you are? - Saint Andrews. Donny said that name, that God led us to Saint Andrews. I'll find you. - I have to go. - I thought you girls were gonna give up smoking. - Gina, stop trying to be my goddamn mommy. Besides, it's the one thing I do everyday that's for me. - I heard Ricky last night. Tina left some time this morning. - Tina said she's gonna crash at Ricky's suppliers, the place where he gets that stuff. - That feel good shit? Makes me feel more alive. - Makes me feel numb. - I like being numb, especially with Ricky. - He loves you. - You don't know nothing about love. - And what do you know about it? - Love? Love is when you feel safe. It ain't gonna dry up and throw you out. - Here she goes again with her poetic shit. I'm only gonna ask you this once. Did you get in touch with that man? - What man? - Man who brought you the poetry. - I don't see how I would. - Neither do I, but he found us, which makes me think either homeboy had some luck or somebody wanted him to come here. - What's the matter? You don't mind sharing me with your other boys. - He's different. I don't want him with my girl. - I'm sure he'll be willing to pay for the time. We could use more money. - We? That's my money. - I only meant the girls and I have been good. We could use some new shoes. Ricky, now? I'm... Come on, tell me you love me. - I... - Tell me you love me. Come on, baby, just three little words. - I love you, Ricky. Only you. - Good girl. I don't know if Layla will be up for round two. How did you find us, hombre? - You ain't that hard to find. You just gotta know who to ask. Oh, my God. Look at you. Come here. Hi. - Hey. Ricky took some convincing so you could have me tonight. - Is he treating you any better? - When Ricky's not happy, you're not happy. I never thought I'd see you again. - Me neither. - I never had the chance to call you till the other day. - Whatever happened to your friend? - I lost her. - I'm so sorry. - You okay? You look nervous. - I'm not sure I know what I'm doing. - You don't think I'm pretty anymore? - Oh, no, I like you. I spent many nights looking at all those old pictures that we took all those years ago. - Even though I'm older now? Some of the boys don't like girls over a certain age. - Oh. I like you. - I never knew I could feel like that. - John was a criminal. - He was safer than Ricky. - The lesser of two evils? - John's not evil! He loved me! - He's a pedophile, Layla. A pedophile. - You're wrong! - He lied to you. - My pictures. - He had a website filled with pictures like this. He was making money from your photos. - No. No. John was a good man! - He manipulated you, just like he did all the other little girls. He was just like Ricky! - No. Nobody was as bad as Ricky! - Layla. Started celebrating without me,? - Just wanted to relax a little, that's all. - I can help with that. See this? I got this when I was still a kid. Mi padre wanted me to be a man, make him proud because we had the same name. Something so simple about a letter just helps you remember where you belong. Don't you feel good? - Yeah. - There's that smile. The same smile I saw on your face when you were with that last night. You're mine, you understand? - I do. - You don't. But you will. If I fucking see him again, he's fucking dead! You feel that? You feel that? That's me inside of you. Now, you'll never forget where you belong. Hey. - You gotta go. - Why? - Ricky said if he finds you here again, he'll kill you. - Hey, what happened to your neck? - It's what happens when I don't listen. - He did that to you? - He'll do worse if he finds you here. - Layla, I can't leave you again. Come with me. - What? I can't. - Layla, he'll kill you if you stay. Come with me. Start a new life somewhere else. I can take care of you. What about Gina and Kim? - They can't ever know. This is our chance. It's now or never. - You're crazy. - Probably. But I can't walk away from you again. I never met a girl like you, Layla. - Okay. How far are we from Ricky? - We're about a six-hour drive. Hey, what do you wanna eat? - I never really had a choice. I haven't picked anything since I was a kid. - Well, you get to make all your own choices now. This isn't bad. All right. Now. You still hungry? Here's your cookies too, and your soda. Got an apple and my water. All right. You wanna wash up? All right. - You really think you can get away that easy,? Like it or not, I'm inside of you. - Hey. Everything all right? - I had a nightmare. He's here even when he isn't. I can't get away from him! - Oh, hey. Hey, it's all right. It's all right. It's all right. I'm here. I'm here, I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you. - Hey. May I? They told me to wait, but I waited long enough as it is. - Christian? - I never thought I'd see you again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's my baby. It's my little girl. It's you. I didn't want them to see me like this. - They've been waiting seven years, Layla. Sometimes, you just gotta let go. - I'm never gonna feel normal. Am I?! - You will with closure. I need you to help me get Ricky and Donny before they do this to another little girl, to another Bee Bee. Help me find them! - I can't. I don't know where he's gone! - What's his last name, Layla? - I don't know. I can't help you! - I understand your fear and your frustration, okay? - You, you don't understand anything! - You're not alone in this. There are so many other girls who can relate to and understand what you're going through. I am one of those girls, Layla. My uncle, he was a charismatic man. He was like John in a lot of ways. He took a sweet, innocent, trusting little girl, and changed her. I was never the same after that. He died when I was 18, of cancer. I cried. I cried so hard. My family thought I was crying over him. But what they didn't know is that there was a piece of my childhood buried in that box with him. I was relieved when it was over. That experience is why I wanna help girls like me, girls like you, Layla. You are not alone in this, okay? I can promise you that. - I know Ricky's number by heart. If you need anything else, you're gonna have to find Tina. - This is Detective Walker. I need a bus down at the old Mills Building. - Can't fucking get away from you. - I hated you once too. But now, I look at you, and I hate myself for it. I never wanted to take your place. - Ricky loved me once. - He loved the money. - He loved you. He wanted me to pick you. - He and Donny need to be stopped. - Ricky's family. - He left you to die out there. Family doesn't do that. - I got too old. - Tina. If you don't do this, other girls, they'll get hurt, or worse. Just like Bee Bee. You don't want that. I know you don't. - Bee Bee. - Stop protecting Ricky. He did nothing, nothing to protect us! - How did you get away? - Where did she go? - Ricky, Ricky, calm down. - Where did she go. Where did she fucking go?! - I don't know, I don't know, sorry. - You fucking lying? You fucking lying to me? Would you fucking lie to me?! Would you fucking lie to me?! - No! - Fucking bitch! Fuck! We're supposed to be a fucking family! Why'd she do this to me? Why would she fucking do this to me? What the fuck?! - You knew about this? You fucking knew about this. She's fucking dead. She's fucking dead! - Hello? Hello,. I know it's you. I made a decision today. You come back to me or I'm killing your sisters, and starting fresh. You know you don't want that. Come home or they die tomorrow. - Hey. You know what I've been thinking? We need to get out to Phoenix. My grandparents own property out there. You can be my little model. We could take pictures out in the desert, huh? - I can't. Well, we can go somewhere else, then. - No. I can't go with you. - Layla, hey. Well, we could go anywhere. - I have to go back. He said he'd kill them if I don't. - No. No, Layla. He doesn't mean it, all right? He is just trying to trick you. - I couldn't forgive myself if he hurt them 'cause of me. Please, take me back. I'm never gonna be normal, John. - No. No, Layla, look, I love you. - Then let me go! - Dammit. Layla, you don't have to do this. - You should start a life with someone that'll make you happy. - You make me happy. - Don't make this harder than it is. You're the only person who was ever good to me, John. - You shut the fuck up! - Take my fucking girl, bitch?! Fuck you! You fucking piece of shit! You fucking like that?! You abandoned your family. You ran away from me. I tried to teach you, to make you see. This is what happens when you don't let me protect you. She's all yours. Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! - I love you and forgive you. We'll always be together. We're bound to one another. My mustang. Tell me you love me. - I hate you! - You fucking bitch! You will love me! I'll make you fucking love me! Fuck you! You will love me. You will love me. I'll make you love me. I'll make you love me. I'll make you love me. Layla? Layla. Layla. Layla. Donny! - They said a homeless man found me buried under trash bags. - What do I have to do? Bee Bee. Layla. Hello? Layla. Who's there? - How could you leave me, Layla? - No! I didn't! - You promised you wouldn't leave me! - They got him, baby. They got him. He will never hurt another little girl again, okay? They got him. - It doesn't take back what he did to us! - I know. - It doesn't bring her back! - Bring who back? - I can't do this anymore. - Ricky, there's nothing I can do for you. - Get me a deal. Get me Layla. - She doesn't wanna see you. - I'll tell her where Bee Bee is. - I doubt that'll do anything for you in here. - Just get me the goddamn isolation cell! - I don't think I can do this. - Layla. - I don't know what to say to him. - Just listen. You do it for Bee Bee. I know you can do this. You're free, Layla. Ricky is the one in the cage. He can't hurt you anymore. - Where's Bee Bee? - My mustang. - Those scars really fit you, shows just how ugly you are. - Some scars are on the surface. Others, below. I know I made my mark on you,. - Where is she? - I wish you could suck me off one more time. - Fuck you! - You did. All the time. - My brother told me what they do to guys like you in prison. How are you liking it in there? - You always were a little mouthy bitch. - Now, you get to be someone's bitch! - If I tell you... If I tell you, you'll make me a deal? You get me into isolation. - What's that? - It means I'm protected. You do this for me, I tell you where she is. We got a deal? Got her at a place 30 miles outside of Baker. 2425 Marsh Street. Now, you do right,. - I can't. - You stupid whore. Enjoy your new family,. - Layla! Layla! You lying cunt! You fucking bitch! I will fucking kill you! - Where's Kim? - She couldn't be here. She just wasn't ready to. - She blames us. For Ricky and Donny's arrest. - Give her time. She'll come around. - Bee Bee would've liked it here. - Couldn't come here after you disappeared. It hurt too much. I remember how much you used to love this ride as a kid. You used to beg me to spin you to the point where you couldn't even see straight. - Or walk straight.
