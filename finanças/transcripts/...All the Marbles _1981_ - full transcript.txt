- Hang on. - Come on. Watch out for her hair. Watch on that hair. Will you? Come on! Let's wrestle. Let's go. Are you crazy? Do your job. You better stay out of this, lady. - She's not choking her. - I know, I know. Baby, hang in there. Hang in there. 'Alright. You got it. Come on.' Just stay out of here. Just stay out of here. Get out.. One, two, three. 'Beautiful. California Dolls.' 'Go get 'em honey.' - Go get her. - Come on. Let's go. - Come on, stop that. - She's chokin' her. Choke! Come on, ref. Hey, hey! Let's go. Call it. How could you not call this? - 'Move on' - No holding. What are you waiting for. Come on! - 'Oh, that's cool.' - That's enough. 'We want The Dolls.' We want The Dolls. - $250. - It's $240. I'll let you have the girls for Thanksgiving. Same price as tonight. Think about it. Can't help ya. Rhody, if you ever need a friend...buy a dog. - Doc, you got a minute? - Yeah. Hope I didn't slug your friend out there too hard. Who? You mean, Harry? Listen, it's the best thing that happened to him all week. Sorry we had to win but nice to work with you guys anyway. - See you later. Take care. - Bye, bye. What a fantastic show you girls put on tonight. - Pretty good, huh? - No, not good, darling. - It was sensational. - The audience loved us-- No. They didn't love you. They ate it up. They loved it. - Are we getting Thanksgiving? - I'm negotiating. Does that mean he doesn't want us? No, it's not that. I'm asking a lot of money. Well, are we gonna get it? Depends, I still gotta push some buttons. Hey, honey. You look better with your clothes off. I didn't know you were bilingual. So we're not getting Thanksgiving. It's-it's gonna be tough. It's uphill. - I'm not gonna lie to you. - This is the pits! - What do you've to do-- - Yeah, what do you've to do? Gotta walk on water to get a $12 raise. - Every path has its pace. - Every path, your ass! A hard beginning maketh a good ending. Harry, do me a favor and take that some place else 'cause I'm not in the mood. Anybody hungry? I said is anybody hungry? What is this? A school for the deaf and dumb? Nobody hungry? I'm buying. Hey, I'm not kidding around. I'm really buying. Real food or that junk garbage we have every night? No, no. Five blocks up the road, there's a brand new Fatburger. It's fantastic. For once, can't we eat at a place with a tablecloth? Hm, it's okay with me, but those frills cost money. 'Don't you think it's about time we got a new muffler?' - 'Just remember.' - 'Those frills cost money.' 'How much longer?' 'How much longer?' 'Longer than a breath, shorter than a lifetime.' Could you give that to me in miles? There was a crooked man. He walked a crooked mile. - He found a crooked-- - Keep it up, Harry. - Trying to entertain you. - Try silence. 'Why don't we stop and get some candy?' 'Candy is dandy. Liquor is quicker.' 'Give us a break. Will you?' 'A conversation with you is like talking to a fortune cookie.' What's it with all these things? Where do you get 'em all? You know, that's a very interesting story. When my parents came over here from the old country the only thing my father knew how to do was be a tailor. So he got a job as a tailor, cutting pants and vests. They wouldn't let him cut coats. He knew he had to become a citizen in order to stay in the country. He couldn't speak English. Not one word. So the union sent him to school. Maybe that's what we need, a union. Better pay, better conditions, and no managers. Now at school, they explained to him you have five years to learn the answers to some simple questions and he had to learn how to speak English. So my father asked them, "How am I gonna learn to speak English?" Teacher says, "Very simple. You read New York Times, Clifford Odets and Will Rogers." So what happened? So, for the rest of his life my father read New York Times, Will Rogers, and Clifford Odets. And in five years, he become a citizen. What does that have to do with the way you talk? When my sister and I got old enough to ask questions any question.. ...my father, he always answered with a quote. From either Rogers or Odets. Who were Rogers and Odets? Rogers and Odets? They're a dance team. They worked in the Catskills. - 'How you feeling?' - Come on. Come on. - 'How you feeling?' - Hair, hair up. 'Oh, she's choking her.' Bite her. Bite the son of a bitch. Get up. Chin up. Don't choke. Give up! Legs and ass. Kick out. - 'Kick out.' - Kick out. Get up! Get up! I'm hurt! Take a deep breath. Deep breath. Is there a doctor in the house? Get a doctor. This girl's in pain. You gotta move. You gotta roll. - You can't fall-- - Shh, shh. Leave me alone. Feet and shoulders. How many times do I tell you? - Oh, God! What? Get away. - Where does it hurt? My ribs. I think I broke a couple. Your ribs? Don't move. I said don't move. Molly will.. Molly, you're on your own. You move, I'll kill you. Molly, you gotta watch the flip. Watch the sunset flip. One, two, three.. There's no bones broken. Just maybe a bad sprain. Stay off your back for a few days. There goes your social life, Iris. - She's as healthy as a horse. - Right. And you ought to know. He used to be the official vet of Pimlico. - Very funny. - Stay in here a minute, Doc. I wanna talk to you. You're way ahead. You're lucky he didn't shoot you. Listen, while you're here, I got a problem-- What's the problem? - Are you okay? - I guess so. As Harry would say, that guy should be a bone specialist. He's got the hip for it. Excuse me. You the manager for the California Dolls? Yeah. Why? Well, they're really very good, you know. I know. What's the deal? Nothing really except if you ever wanna bring your girls to Japan to wrestle I'd like to arrange a tour. Why would you wanna do that? If your girls ever get to be champions I think we could make a lot of money together. Your girls will be very, very big in Japan. Here. Hm...this you? Yeah. Clyde Yamashito. - Pleasure meeting you, sir. - Likewise. Lookin' forward to doing business with ya. Here, why don't you try one of these? You'll feel better in no time. - It's quite a collection. - Well, it pays to be prepared. Never know where it's gonna hurt tomorrow. Any suggestions? Mm, why don't you try one of the pink ones. There might not be a tomorrow if you keep taking these. - Does it make a difference? - Yes, it makes a difference. Doesn't it? Yeah, it makes a difference. - Come in. - Harry. Your money is on the desk. How's the girl? Oh, she's just great. You're short 20. Harry, we charge towel and linen service. What kinda crap is that? Harry, you got your money. Your girls are probably beat. Why don't you be a big sport and get 'em a cup of coffee or something? You're short 20, Eddie. Our girls are a class act. They deserve to get paid. If I wanted a class act, I'd get the Bronte sisters. My dolls would tear their legs off. Harry, I don't have to tell you the business is changing. I gotta give a piece of the action to unions, concessions. - That requires-- - You break my heart, Eddie. I'm not leaving until I get the 20. Can't help ya. Wanna call Cisco a son of a bitch. Yeah, call me a son of a bitch. 'I gave up a long time ago tryin' to please everybody.' Girls earned the money. I want it. Be happy you got what you got. 'Cause that's all you gonna get. The only reason you had anybody in this toilet tonight was because of my Dolls. That crowd out there came to see them. I'll level with you. You have a couple of sweet numbers there. But the customers don't give a damn. 'All they want is tits and ass.' Don't matter if it's your broads or someone else's broads. Look, you cheap bastard. $20 means something to my girls. To you, it's nothing. It's banana money for your gorilla. Ok, big mouth. You know who I am? Alright, Eddie. Impress me. I promote over 20 arenas in this area alone. I'm leaving this area. Harry, I don't care if you leave the planet. You're never gonna work for me again. 'Harry, ooh.' - Be seein' ya. - Hey, don't move. I wanna forget you just the way you are. Hey, boss. Really think he didn't remember anything about the towel fee? Shut up, Jerome. Harry, what's wrong with you? Was he acting weird tonight, I tell you. Hey, what happened in there? Hey, did you get the money? - 'Why are we stopping?' - 'What are we looking for?' 'Would you please tell us what happened?' What is wrong with you? Harry, how much money did he give you tonight? What, huh? Hey, what you doin' with a bat? Don't do anything you're gonna regret later, Harry. - 'Harry, this is crazy.' - 'This is a real mistake.' Harry. Harry, what are you gonna do? - 'You're lookin' for trouble.' - 'Will you listen to me?' Harry, didn't he give you all the money? 'Why won't you tell us what's going on?' 'You're playin' around with the wrong guy.' 'Come on, Harry. Don't do it.' - Harry, don't you dare. - 'You're not--' 'I don't believe this.' 'Oh my God!' What was that all about? I was thinking about buying a Mercedes. But first I wanted to give it a stress test. - Stress test? - Didn't pass. You're crazy, Harry. Absolutely, certifiably...crazy. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up. Ah, it's okay, I can't sleep either. What's bothering you? Wondering what's still bothering you. I've never seen you smoke before. I honestly don't know if I can take this anymore. Molly. All we're doing is running around in circles. We're not getting any place. - I know it seems that way but-- - It is that way. So, you're gonna give up? No. I'm not gonna give up. Get out maybe...while I'm stillin one piece. And do what? Go back to LA? Maybe, I can get my old job back. - At the answering service? - Yeah. You're dreaming, Mol. That's not how it was. I only said maybe. For all I know, I could-could get into real estate or...or advertising maybe. Even work in an art gallery. So what if I didn't finish high school? Can always go to night school. Nobody to come home to. Nobody to give a damn what you do. Whereas, now, I've got you and that son of a bitch to come home to. Yeah, and we need you, Mol. Hey, I couldn't work with anybody but you. And who, but you, could put up with Harry? Like it or not, the three of us are a team and we're gonna make it or die tryin'. I love you, Mol...and so does the son of a bitch. He'll never admit it, but he does. Okay. Turn out the light, go to sleep. 'They're the hottest tag team in the state.' 'I can't explain it myself.' 'The other night in Akron, they couldn't get out of the arena.' 'They're like rock stars and beautiful.' 'First, listen, face facts.' 'We both know most lady wrestlers are dogs.' 'So, now they expect the Pekingese' 'and out comes Marilyn Monroe. They go wild.' 'Dogs. I'll settle for dogs.' 'I just want to fill out the card!' 'What're you talking about? Dogs are winners.' 'Talk about a winning act.' 'Winners, I don't need. Any douche slappers will do!' You're gonna have to do better than that. I'm talking about a class act. Tell you what I'll do? A hundred and a quarter for tonight. That's the deal and that's it. - I'm on the phone. - 'It's me.' I'd love to make a deal with you. 'But unless you sweeten the pot, I'm gonna have to take a pass.' Do you want your coffee or don't you? Uh, hold on a minute. He's my man. You're not even offering expenses. A hundred and a quarter. That's it. Hey, we waited this long, we'll wait a little longer. Then we won't need you. Lousy, no good son of a bitch. You quoting Rogers and Odets again? Who's a lousy, no-good son of a bitch? Never mind. What can you expect from a day that starts with gettin' up in the morning? Sounded like you turned somethin' down. Unlike you, Iris, I occasionally turn down an offer. Don't start in on me, Harry. All I'm saying is you could consult us sometimes. I didn't get us this far by consulting you every time. Where are the car keys? Mol and I are going out for breakfast. You two eatin' again? You just ate last night. Sorry, old habits are hard to break. In the back pocket. Okay, Harry, come on. I put the bubble bath in. Oh, excuse me. You always were attracted to shy girls, Harry. Alright, Iris. Give me a break. - You a friend of Harry's too? - Oh, isn't everyone? Isn't Harry the absolute greatest? Yes, he certainly is. You heard the lady. Eat your heart out. Now take a walk. Just leaving. It was nice seeing you. Same here. Harry, Robert Redford called again. Now, I told him you couldn't be disturbed. You mean, you really do know him? - Iris, out. - Just leaving. 'Like you always say, Harry, familiarity breeds contempt..' ...and children. Ta ta. What is Robert Redford really like? Oh, he's a regular guy. You know, like you and me. Down to earth. Rob is not a snob. - 'What's his favorite food?' - Come here, quick. Come here. 'None. No interest in food. An occasional sardine.' - 'So, what happened?' - 'Happened to whom?' 'To your father.' 'He kept quotin' Rogers and Odets.' 'And finally he got to cut coats. Then he died.' 'Aw. So, what happened to you mother and sister?' 'Ma's in a nursing home in Newark.' 'She don't remember anybody.' 'My sister..' '...she married an Italian baker that lived in Queens.' 'If you want bread, marry a baker, right.' 'That's a sad story, Harry.' 'Well, as Clifford Odets would say 'It's better than stickin' a pencil in your eye.' 'So why are you calling me?' Uh, because, Solly, I've got two of the most sensational kids to ever hit this business. - Yeah? Guys or girls? - Two girls. Who are they? Old girlfriends? No, it's absolutely legitimate, Solly. Yeah, what's the name of the act? - The California Dolls. - Oh yeah, the sexy broads. - 'Same ones.' - Never heard of them. Of course, you heard of them. They're outstanding. Now here's the thing, Solly, these kids got that stuff. They got a magic. They're like rock stars. Believe me the audience goes crazy. They've got beauty and they've got talent. - Call me in the summer. - When? - 'June.' - June? I can't call you in June, Solly. Christ, that's eight months away. June. Son of a...bitch! Want some chocolate? No thanks, that junk just gives you calories. Let's go. Did you get me a 3 Musketeer? Didn't have any. I got you Snickers. I don't want a Snicker! I asked for a 3 Musketeer! What are you, eight years old? Have some of my M&M's. I hate M&M's! - That'll be 29.91. - Wonderful. - Now here's 25. Who's got five? - It's your turn. This is getting to be a habit, you know. Well, we all have different habits. - Here's a five. - Alright, that makes thirty. There's your five cents. I have no pennies. I'll have to go inside. I'll wait. Give me the nickel, Harry. Thank you. 'What about the pennies, Harry?' 'Where there's no sense, there's no feeling.' 'You know girls, those Japanese wrestlers' 'really put on a great show.' 'And I keep telling you, you better learn that sunset flip.' 'It's real flashy and wipes them out.' 'Molly, she could have pinned you twice with that.' 'You were lucky you hit the ropes.' That's a bad cough you got there. You really ought to do something about that. There's no harm in appreciating other forms of music. Now, this is an Italian tenor. His name is Attilio Belfiori, and the opera is Pagliacci. It's beautiful. Listen to it. - It'll make you cry. - I'm crying already. - What did Solly say? - 'Solly said maybe.' 'Harry, the smoke and this cold are killing me.' 'You can make a fortune selling' 'thermal underwear in this state.' Does that mean Solly is coming to see us? No, it means...it's not a no. It's gonna take a little bit more time, that's all. Got a cigarette? - How about a little heat here? - You're getting it. If I put it on full blast, the car will blow up. Just shoot this car and put it out of its misery. - My last one. - 'Thanks.' You ought to cut down anyway. These things'll kill ya. Love the way you're always looking out for our welfare. Oh, by the way, Molly.. ...I got somethin' for you. Okay, thanks a lot, Harry. But I don't like doin' it. You really ought to start cuttin' down on those things. If something happened to you, this other one here she'd be left to herself, will be all by herself. He's right, Molly. After all, we're a tag team. 'Harry!' 'Didn't you see a car do the hustle before?' 'And you wonder why I take pills?' You know, I had a thought, an idea for you girls it's not fully realized, but it could be sensational. We are not getting tattooed, Harry. No, I'm cold on that. I got a better one. - Ya dye your hair. - So what else is new? Not just the hair on your head, I'm talking about your eyebrows. When you raise your arm, you know under there. The fuzz over here. And it doesn't have to be vulgar. I'm talking about pretty colors. There's nothing more beautiful than frost-colored hair or a lovely silvery blonde color that picks up the light when you go into the ring. That stinks. You're wrong, it fits in with today. Did you know that in Paris, the high fashion models.. 'I'll show you pictures, Woman's Wear Daily.' We decided we wanted to be the one tag team without a gimmick. Remember? Yeah but not your legs. You shave your legs. It's a stupid idea. Thought this up yourself or did you have help? What's wrong with it? We'll look like clowns, that's what's wrong with it. The idea stinks. Alright, have it your way, doll. Remember, you only got so many chances at the brass ring 'and you better take every one of 'em' 'because when you run out of turns, kid, that's it.' You got the picture? Now move your ass, you're slow. Someday, you'll go too far, Harry. And I hope you stay there. Miserable bastard. I think we hurt Harry's feelings again. Oh, yeah? How can you tell? Ah, you're in rare form today, ladies. Rare form. Remember, anytime you don't like the way I'm handling things just say the word and the job is yours. 'We never said you weren't a good manager, Harry.' Just a lousy human being. That's what I like about you, Molly. You got a real sense of humor. You just bring out the best in me, Harry. I must have done 25 miles today. Shut your face. You too. Put that down. Alright, we got a chance. We got a real honest to God chance. But if you two cows wanna bust your butt making pocket change that's your business, count me out. Look at me. Turn around. All I know is if you wanna get somewhere maybe make some important money, you got to lay off being such smart asses and listen to what I got to say. Don't answer. You too. - Harry, lunch is on us. - Okay, Harry? - Get in the car. - Come on. We're buying. Well, they better serve steaks. Yeah, with real tablecloths. 'Oh boy, we've got to bear down tonight.' 'I'm telling you girls, listen to me.' 'Can't coast tonight, kids.' 'This can be a very important fight.' 'Toledo Tigers. You're not fighting two shleppers.' 'They didn't become champs by accident.' 'I'm telling you these are two big strong girls.' 'Because they're champs, there's gonna be a lot of exposure' 'gonna be a lot of booking agents there.' - 'So, bear down.' - 'Don't get so worked up.' 'This is a non-title fight, remember?' 'Do we ever get any other kind?' 'Trust me, girls. This is a big step up.' 'Maybe, this'll be a good time to try the sunset flip.' 'Do you know who Big John Stanley is?' 'Who the hell cares who he is.' 'Aw, sweetie, if you're in this racket' 'you must know who Big John Stanley is. ' 'Now 30 years ago, this man was' 'the light heavyweight champion of the world.' 'He also helped coach the United States team' 'at the Rome Olympics.' 'Now since then, he's become a manager.' 'No matter who he handled' 'I don't care if it's a man, woman, or midget' 'they were always the best.' 'This man stands for the creme de la creme' 'of the wrestling world.' Harry, the damn machine took all my money and won't give me the cigarette. Stand back, sweetie. You can't be nice to these things. They only understand one thing. - Wow! - Come on, girls. I don't have all day. 'Check the coin return, you never know.' Let's face this off, June. - Let it go. - That's it. Come on. Can't you take it, doll? 'She's down.' Here we go. That's it. Get up and pin her. Get up. Come on, get up. You're kicking. That's not wrestling. Ref, get out of here. Let her fight. Told you to watch the kicking. - Back to your corner. Go back. - Christ, she can't do that. - Hey ref-- - 'Leave him alone.' You can do a lot, but you can't do that. - Hair. - 'Don't let her, kid.' You want my honest opinion? You're a horse's ass. - Hair. - 'Finish this off, June.' - That way, Iris. - Turn it around, Iris. You can turn this around, baby. - Hair, hair, hair. - Hey. Get up. Yes, sir, that's my baby! No problem, sweetheart. Stay loose. 'Get up, June. Give it a pin.' Come on, get up. Get up there. Come on. Get off me, you double crossing tanker. - 'One two.' - Wait, stop. Better make the pin, sweetheart. - One, two.. - Get up. Get up. 'Beautiful, honey. You got it! Yeah.' Boo. Ah, boo. - A miracle! - You did a good job. A miracle. California Dolls. 'You're seeing the next champions of the world.' - I'm number one here. - Number one, huh. I just don't understand what happened. What are you getting so excited about? - It's just another match. - But we lost. So you lost. Big deal. It's not the first time. Certainly won't be the last. Besides, it wasn't for the championship. But we were supposed to win. Oh, you weren't supposed to win. Nobody is ever supposed to win. I did ask Harry if it were close and he could see his way clear I would appreciate it if he would speak to his girls about not trying so hard since this is your home territory. Yeah. 'And we'd return the favor.' So? So, Harry would or would not do what he had to do. I would have done the same thing. And what do you think you were doing out there? - Wrestling. - You didn't let June pin you. Honey, I don't let anybody pin me. You aren't good enough to beat us, that's your problem. Say what? Those were our fans out there. They came to see us win. Yeah, but when you lost they didn't sound too brokenhearted to me. How'd you like another kick in the butt? John, I think we better separate these girls till they cool down. Don't tell me to cool down, you pimp. Watch who you're calling names, you cow. Alright, I hate to break this duel of wits. Maybe you need that little baby face of yours messed up. - Cool it, June. - Mind your own business. These two smart asses got something coming. Maybe you'd like to start it, huh? You bet your ass. Are you crazy? What am I.. Oh, shit. Not again. Get the hell out of here. - I'll disqualify your girl. - Choke. You call it. You call it. You call it. Choke. Why are we doing all the pushing when we are paying all the bills. Road work. It's good for you. I suppose, this is road work. You're using your legs. Yeah, what are you using? Your ass? 'What did Solly say about Chicago?' - 'We're close.' - 'Close. How close?' 'We've been hearing that for months.' 'Very close. I'm right on top of this' 'and I know for a fact that Solly is interested' 'in the California Dolls.' You better not be making this up, Harry. Why would I make it up? Look at it this way. If Solly wasn't interested in The Dolls we wouldn't have the date in the first place. Now we're getting a new price. - Five big ones. - Alright. - Five big ones? - Five big ones. You got a cigarette? I want one. You don't change, do you? I ask the question. If something's perfect why would you change it? Well, Mr. Perfect, we got to stop because now I'm out. I wish you two would stop smoking. 'It's really bad for your health.' 'You think we got it tough?' 'How'd you like to work in there?' Alright, tell me, Earl, what's the deal. Oh, well, you'll be fighting the local champs. The creatures from the Black Lagoon. I came up with that name myself, ladies. - Oh. - That is very catchy. Thank you. It's all for a worthy cause. This year, we're gonna add a rec room onto the American Legion Hall. - No kidding. - Yeah. You'll be surprised how ping pong can add some fun to an old soldier's life. - Oh I bet. - Right this way. Come on ladies, this way. The Ladies Auxillary pitched in and painted the benches. All I want know is, where's the ring. Oh, no ring? You're gonna wrestle in that mud hole over there. - Mud hole? - 'Oh, yeah.' 'It's become an annual highlight of the carnival.' 'Ah, by the way, I do a little joke every year.' I come out before the bout, and I say "Now, girls, I want a good, clean fight." 'See, the fight's in mud.' That always gets a good laugh from the crowd. I came up with that line myself. Yeah, well you can do something else by yourself. Think about it. Come on, Mol, let's get the hell outta here. - Ah! - Creep. - Did-did you see-- - Alright, just relax. I'm gonna take care of everything. That's no way to talk to a Lieutenant Governor of the Kiwanis Club. - Alright, relax girl. - Where the hell have you been? Relax, come on, calm down. Hey! Calm down. It's a little mud, it'll wash off. What about the embarrassment? That doesn't wash off so easy. Do you think that I knew that you're gonna fight in mud? - Yes. - Seriously? This is a career move. Rolling in mud is a career move? Very important. Because it establishes a new price for us. We can point to a contract. We got it here in black and white. We're getting $500 a night. - For...get it. - No one's gonna see you. And now really, look at this dump. Who's here? Trust me, girls. It's not gonna be on the Wide World of Sports. We're not going into the goddamn mud pit, and that's it! I'm not turning myself into a sideshow freak for you or anybody else. - No way. - Hey! Every time you walk into the ring, you're a freak. And that's what a wrestler is. You didn't sign up to be the Queen of England so get off your high horse. 'So you jump in a little mud. Big deal!' 'You're costing us five bills.' - 'Five! F-I-V-E.' - We're not interested, Harry. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. E-V-E-R, ever. Ladies, you wanna pay.. Ladies, you're not paying attention. Only two in the ring. - You out. - You in. Oh, my god, no. 'Somebody help him.' I never knew you were a party crasher. Merle. Merle, there is mud in your eye. There is some mud in your eye. 'I can't tell Merle from the girls. Gosh, look at this man.' - Evelyn, honey, I'm sorry. - Forget it, Merle. 'Looks like he's gonna sleeping on the couch tonight, I think.' 'This is a business where you got a plenty of hard knocks.' 'As a matter of fact, here's a couple of pretty good knockers.' 'Ladies and gentlemen, everything you're seeing here' 'is absolutely real, you don't think this is real' 'take a look under those T-shirts.' 'Wait a minute, you're gonna miss the best part.' 'The best is yet to come. Don't leave yet.' 'And there they go. My god, look at this.' 'Ladies and gentlemen, you're seeing it all right here.' - 'They're at it again.' - Mr. and Mrs. Cobel. Oh, my god, we're losing the seniors. 'Lady, can I be the mud in your life.' Oh, shit! You know what, I never told you this, Merle. But you are an asshole. 'Oh, man, look at them jugs!' 'Roll all over again.' 'That's it, yeah.' 'Look at them boobies, they're in the dirt.' 'Car should be ready at 7 o'clock.' 'Thanks for the lift.' 'Thanks again.' That lip is still bleeding. Let me take a look. Don't touch me. You've already caused enough trouble for one day. - I'm gonna clean up next door. - Sure. Get the hell outta my way! Goddammit! Open the door! Get out here and open the door! 'Iris, you got to do something about that lip.' 'Quit playing Dr. Kildare, open the door, and let me in.' Iris, that thing is wide open. Let me clean it up. Will you just leave me alone? Okay, just leave me alone. I hate your guts, Harry. I hate everything about you. I can't stand the sight of you anymore. You're fired. Get the hell out. Get the hell outta my life. You're a lousy lover, you're a lousy manager. And you're a lousy human being. Now, that really hurts. I am not a lousy manager. This is all your fault, Harry. None of this woulda happened if it wasn't for you. You did this to me. You turned me into a freak today. They were laughing at me, Harry, they were laughing at me. And it was all your fault. You know what you are, Harry? You're a low life. A lousy, stinking low life. Loser, loser, loser, loser, loser. Ah. Alright, sweetie. Alright. Harry, they laughed at me. I.. I can take anything but them laughing at me. Why did you let them laugh at me? They never laughed at you, sweetheart. - Yes, they did. - No. They're just trying to have a good time. Here, let me get that. Why do you? Why do you always have to hurt me? I don't know. No, I don't know. Well.. There's blood, all over your face. Yeah, don't make any difference. Oh, hold me, Harry. I've needed you so long. I want you, Harry...now. 'Says here that Superstar and Big Mama are going' 'to battle it out for the world championship.' Wow, 25 grand to the winner and 10 grand to the loser. - Not bad for a night's work. - No kidding. I once saw Big Mama in L.A. She's so big all she'd do is sit on you, and it's all over. That Superstar is no slouch either. - Should be a pretty good match. - When's it gonna be? Oh, I don't know, it doesn't say. Wait a minute, yes it does. The Christmas show in Reno. Hey, there's a story in here about us you guys. "One of the hottest tag teams on the circuit today are "the gorgeous California Dolls, who seem unbeatable "everywhere they appear and are definitely the rising stars of the wrestling world". They got the gorgeous part right. What else does it say? Hey, It's got our pictures too! Look at this, take a look. We're stars! - My picture in there? - No. That's right. Harry. We're stars. We look a lot better than that. Well, It's an old picture. Yeah. They've even got us ranked. We're number three tag team in the country. Who's number one? The champs, dummy, the Toledo Tigers. Then it's the Amazon Queens. 'This is it, we finally made the big time.' - 'What about it, Harry?' - 'What about what?' 'Why do I have to do all the thinking around here.' 'This is the break, we've been waiting for.' 'Talk to Solly. If you can get us on as the opening match' 'in Reno, we'll have it made.' Think of all the publicity. - Give me the magazine. - Here's what we gotta do. One, I gotta call Solly. Two, I get Solly to see the article the picture and the rankings. What we really need now is some bucks for some publicity. 'Unfortunately, in the words of Toulouse-Lautrec' '"I'm a little short."' But, your suggestion is very good. I'm not ignoring that. Thank you. Alright. There's a phone. I'll call Solly. Don't forget to tell Solly, about the magazine, page 87-88. Yeah, yeah. Don't worry. Page 87-88. - We'll pick up a few things. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. If it's on sale, I need toothpaste. - Okay. - Aquafresh. 'Okay.' - But only if it's on sale! - Alright, alright! Wow, a drive-through super market. Fascinating business. Now this is really a great idea. Solly, Harry Sears. Gee, I'm glad I got you, Solly. Listen, something came up. Very important. - In this week's issue-- - Don't you every say hello? We'll say hello later. First I wanna talk. Now hear me out on this, Solly. Very important. - In this week's issue-- - I saw it. - I'm talking about the spread. - I saw it. Oh, you saw it on the Dolls? Page 87 and 88 with a picture. I saw it for God sake. Well, listen, Solly. That's an old picture, you know. - They look even better now. - 'I like the picture.' Yeah, I like it too. It's a hell of a picture. Here is the thing, Solly. Do yourself a favor. Hold all calls and give me your undivided attention for two minutes. Wednesday night, standard rate. Take it or leave it. - We'll take it. - 'Main event.' Oh, listen, Solly, on the billing there-- Well? Oh, wasn't easy. Had to push a lotta buttons. Oh, people like Solly, they're murder you gotta wear 'em down. Well, what's that supposed to mean? Chicago, Chicago.. 'Who are we up against tomorrow night.' 'Solly didn't say. But it's the main event.' 'So, whoever it is, it's not gonna be easy.' 'Look, who knows, it might even be the Tigers.' 'If it is, they're gonna be out for your blood.' 'Don't be fooled by the last time.' 'Those girls are brutal. And for god sakes, listen to me.' 'Keep practicing those sunset flips.' 'Harry, would you just leave the wrestling to us.' 'Let's stay at a first class place?' - 'Something special.' - 'That's a good idea.' 'We'll stay at Al's Motor Lodge in Skokie' - 'Every floor has ice machine.' - 'Thanks a lot, Diamond Jim' 'I hate to be the one to remind you. Luxury costs money.' 'I'm sick of staying at those roach motels you keep finding.' - 'Yeah.' - 'You girls are excited.' 'You wanna go first class. That's understandable.' 'Just remember, those frills..' '...cost money.' 'Harry, you always keep playing that same number.' - 'Is that your favorite?' - 'Yeah. What's he saying? 'I mean, what's he singing?' 'Well, you see that's Pagliacci.' 'He is kind a like a strolling player.' 'He goes from town to town entertaining people.' - 'So?' - 'So, sometimes it isn't easy.' - 'Sometimes he gets down.' - 'And?' 'And that's why he is like us.' 'He gotta keep going. Gotta keep trying.' 'Gotta hang in there even if his heart is breaking.' 'Oh!' - You got her. - 'Like hell.' You got her. Hey, it's over. 'Now was that body, was that--' 'Now put some pressure on it. Put some pressure.' 'Watch that choke watch that choke.' 'Watch that choke.' She tried to choke me. - Ah. - 'Okay girl.' - What are you kicking her for? - I'm not. Now, don't let her do that to you. Come on, get up. No problem, baby. You got her. You got her, honey. You got her. - Count. - One, Two. Alright. Alright. That's the way to do it. 'Programs, programs. One dollar.' 'Get your programs here.' Anything goes, sweetheart. Beautiful. 'Programs, programs. One dol--' 'Common, Mol.' Take her out, June. Take her out. This is the big leagues, baby. Anything goes here. - 'You got it.' - You gotta play rough. 'Nice ropes, goddammit.' - 'I'll tell you one thing. - Ropes. That's a ropes play. 'That's for the last time.' Come on. 'Hey, ref, this is bullshit.' 'Alright, June. Let's finish this off. Get her, baby.' - 'Stick it to her, June.' - Yeah. - 'Watch that knee.' - 'That's illegal, ref.' Watch that knee. That's a choke! Choke! One, two, break that hold. Break that hold. 'Break that hold.' 'Alright, don't, don't worry don't press. Just don't press.' 'You'll be alright.' 'Watch that hair. Watch that hair. Watch the--' 'Break that hold. One--' Alright, let's go home now. Let's finish this up. Come on. - What did I do? Huh? - Enough. For Christ sakes. Put your course up. I'll be a son of a bitch. Are you in this fight or not? I'll choke you, asshole. - Come on take her out. - Ah. 'C'mon, Diane, let's do it.' - 'She's choking.' - I don't care. 'Enough resisting, you asshole. Break it up.' Hey, you need a cage. You're such a stupid ass. Your blind as a bat. - One, two, three. - Ah, count, two. It's alright, get her again. - Hey ref.. - Get back to the corner. ...I'll take this cane and shove it up your nose. - Ah, my hair, ref. - 'Oh, no, no, no.' 'Get back in there. Get back to the corner.' - Ah, my hair. - Hold it, one.. One, two.. There are too many girls in the ring. 'One--' 'Come on, June. Come on.' 'Watch her, Iris.' - 'She's on the rope, ref.' - Call it off, you son of-- 'Hold. One, two--' - Ah, June, hit her. - Stop that. - 'That's the way, June.' - One, two.. Ropes, ropes. Ropes, ropes. 'Pop corn, over there.' She's on the rope. 'Break it, ref she's on the ropes.' Remember the last time, baby. - 'Don't give up..' - One, two, three. Now we are even, sister. Alright. She broke the rule. She broke the rule. Illegal move. Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Illegal. Illegal. No, I count her-- No, I counted her out. - On the ropes. No. - No, sir. No, I didn't see it. You're a palooka! On here, on the ropes. Get away. Get away from me. - 'No, no.' - 'I'm gonna fine you.' 'You animal! She was on the God damn rope.' Damn. Damn. Yes. 'I was on the ropes.' - We were robbed. - No, we weren't. We just weren't tough enough. You look okay to me. Just a nose bleed. - Take a couple of aspirin. - Alright, wait outside, Doc. - I'll see you in a minute. - Harry, I'll be around. - You shoulda played dirty. - Why don't you shut up. No, for once I think Harry is right. I told you both before. But, you don't wanna listen to me. If you wrestle for Big John Stanley. You have to be pretty darn good, number one. Number two, you need a better coach than anybody. Well, then maybe we should get Big John to manage us. No such luck, ladies. He only handles blacks. 'You girls decent?' 'Like you to meet a real nice guy.' Great, but in the mean time, who's this? This is my friend, Eddie Cisco. Hey-y-y. Move over. Slide over. I been working all night. Eddie, you know Harry Sears. This is Iris and Molly. Eddie is a promoter and a match maker. He also has a nice business on the side, he rents towels. - Hiya, Sears. - How ya doin', Eddie? What brought you all the way from, Ohio? Not my Mercedes. Seems I developed car trouble. Oh, that's too bad. You oughta join the auto club. I see you brought The, uh, Hulk with you. I saw your picture in the post office. - Ya look even better in person. - Thank you. Figured I drop back and take a look at the Dolls up close. - May be get acquainted. - Well listen, Eddie. Now that you had your look, I suggest that you take a walk. The girls wanna get cleaned up and dressed. Don't let me stop them. I guess, the Tigers gave you a rough time out there. Well, we were out numbered. Like three to two. - What makes you say that? - The ref was on their side. This girl cracks me up. I'm going to be around for a few days. Maybe, you and I can get together? Oh, now. I doubt that. See, I don't mix business with pleasure. 'Oh, by the way.' Eddie just closed the deal to put the Reno match together. - The Reno match? - 'Yeah.' Congratulations, boss. - 'The Christmas show?' - We'd be perfect for that. I'm still shopping. But, I don't know if you girls are ready. - What's wrong with us? - 'Ask Babe Ruth.' Nice to meet you, ladies. Ah...Harry, I hope I run into you soon. Sears, see me before you go. Clever, Harry. You had to pick his car for betting practice. I gotta hand it to you. The Dolls are a good act. Harry said you bought the Toledo Tigers to open Reno. Yeah. They're the champ. You decided on the other team yet? How about...Thunder Thighs and the Madame. Ha ha. Have you seen Thunder Thighs lately? The Thunder's been replaced by Cellulite. Who do you think I should buy? There's nobody as good as the Dolls, and you know it. Okay, so we looked pretty bad up there the other night. But we'll be ready the next time. You could build it as a grudge match. From what I've heard that's not too far from the truth. It'd be terrific. You know you'd get a good show. Let me think about it. Why.. ...why don't you take me dancin'? Aah. I told you, Harry. I don't know where she went. Did she say who she might be going out with? I told you. No. Oh, look at this. Cinderella. Gosh, does she look grand. She finally came home. Must have been a hell of a movie. - Did you have a good time? - Just great, Harry. Just great. - What've you been working on? - I thought we'd move west. That's good 'cause that's the direction we're heading. It's California Dolls against the Toledo Tigers for the championship. Ten thousand. Winner take all. You were with Eddie Cisco last night? So what if I was? Don't you ever touch me again, Harry. Boy, you are just full of surprises, Doll. I woulda let you handle it, Harry but he doesn't go both ways. I checked that. If you don't mind, I'm gonna take a shower. So will you clear out please. What are you looking at me like that for? Why did you hit her? She only did it for us. Did we ask her to? I don't remember asking her to. Look, we needed something and she got it for us. I guarantee you, doin' it didn't come easy for her. Yeah. Well, hearing about it didn't come easy for me. Can I tell her that? No. I'll have your order in a minute, sir. - To Reno. - To Reno. Now, to do this right. And we gotta do it right. It's going to require some real money. How much is real money, Harry? How much you got stashed in that sock? Almost 800. Let me hold that until tomorrow morning. - Come on, man. - Alright, this is all going. - Okay, let it roll. - I only live once. - Big seven. - Six. Aw. - Six. - Hundred dollars. - Another six. Wow. - Yeah, try and do it again. I'll buy the odds here. Now, I can put 400 back here. Can I? Alright. So I got 400 here. So I get...well you know what I get on a back, don't you? - Yeah. - With this, I get.. - Okay. - Hey, hey. Okay, here we go. - What a high. - Six. Six. Another six. 'Glad I followed my horoscope.' Alright, I'm betting then. I'm going to bet 600. - You got it. - Six Hundred. - Let her lay, we'll play. - Ooh! Alright. Okay. I got six stones. - Good shooter. - Good shooter. - Doin' good? - Do a seven. Six. Unbelievable. - Sixes are easy. - I got my six. One, two, three four, five, six. - How much do I get if I win? - Thirty Three. - No, 25. - Huh. Five. Five, no field. Five. Looking for a six. Three is betted hard, boys. Oh. I'd love to make this. Come on, baby. 'Six.' - Another six. - 'Pay the man.' - Another six. - Another six? Quite a few sixes. 22, 23, 24 25, 20. '600 on the line, 600 hundred behind the line.' 'Pays to you 25, 20.' 'Alright, gentlemen I'm gonna bet..' '...100 dollars.' Number of gold. Bet it hard. Six. - Six. - 'Come on give us a six.' - Six. - 'Let's do this.' - Unbelievable. - 'That's awful lot of sixes.' - Alright. - 'Lets go, here we go.' Lets see if we can make another six here. - 'Yeah, lets see that.' - 'Lucky man.' 'I have never seen anybody that lucky.' I think I'll call it a night, gentlemen. - Call it a night? - You did okay for a beginner. I guess I did that. Get those bets.. I heard a noise over there. Maybe he's parked around the corner. Bum, couldn't have gone too far. Give me your money. Give me your money. Give me your money. I think you broke my knee. Get me a doctor. Give me your money. Give me your money. You're not leavin', are ya? Yeah. But don't bother to get up. 'Last August, when you put us in the tin foil' 'made us the space amazons, I felt like a jerk, Harry.' 'Sweetie, I tried something new, it didn't work out.' 'A creative genius needs time to discover the winning formula.' 'Well Mr. Creative Genius. You do understand' 'there's only about a 1000 dollars left' 'after the tune up and polishing the car.' We spent almost all what you won at that crap game, Harry. I hope you know what you're doing. That's a lot of money. Trust me, cookie. I'm goin' on instinct. I once read that's how all the lower life forms survive. When are you gonna admit you're desperate for my body? You talk as though everything about you is as big as your ego. Who said it wasn't. Secret's safe with me, Harry. 'Reno, the biggest little city in world.' So, are you gonna use your funny little dice here too, Harry? No, are you crazy? Not in this town. You'll be laid to rest under Liberace's parking space. Nothing worries Harry more than threat of an honest crap game. 'Boy, Molly, the championship.' 'God, it's scary.' 'It's just like our first time in the ring.' 'Holy cow, Harry, look at that.' I told you, didn't I? Stick with me and I'll have your name up in lights. Wow. 'Here's to looking at you, kid.' 'Oh, Harry, it's the end of the rainbow.' We finally made it. 'Alright, Girls, this is it.' 'We're fighting for the title. We're fighting for our lives.' 'Don't let anything interfere with your concentration.' 'And remember those sunset flips.' Oh, Molly, look at this. Look at this? There's a parade here. Harry, where.. What did they do? - Hey, what happened? - It's nothing. 'This is not Al's Motor Lodge in Skokie, you know.' But, there's ice machines here, huh, Harry? That's right. Talk about frills. They're winning. What's wrong with us? - Been robbed! - Let's go. We checked in. Leave us alone. We're on a winning streak. Hey, woo, holy cow. Ha ha. We struck, Harry. Alright, now you got 'em stuck? Let 'em stay stuck! Let's go. Quit whining already. - Okay, Harry, please. come on. - Wait. It's only nickels. Tighten' that up, fellas. Really pull it. More tension. 'More, more.' Oh. Well what do you girls think? Would I stay until tonight? I think...I'll take a walk. Alright, thanks fellas. - What's eatin' your friend? - Why don't you ask her. A lot of irate managers on the telephone when.. ...they heard the Dolls got this gig. That's their problem. We earned the right to be here. Not what a lot of other people think. Eddie, I don't give a damn what other people think. And if anybody should ask, you can tell them I said so. I like your style. I think we should get together after this is over. Just because we went out once doesn't mean I'm interested in making it a habit. - I thought we were friends. - I guess, you thought wrong. - Bastard. - Bitch. Don't think you've hurt my feelings. I've been called a lot worse by a lot better people than you. Ow. - What's the problem? - Nothing. It's all over. I don't want you talking to my girls. You got somethin' to say, you say it to me. Don't push your weight, small change. If your girl wasn't so good in the sack, you wouldn't be here. Stop it! Stop it! Do you mind. Relax. Now look. Eddie, we all know how we got here. You got what you wanted and we got what we wanted. - So, now we're even, okay? - We're even. Okay? - Harry. Let's get out of here. - Right. I got a thousand that says your girls can't beat the Tigers. - All I got is 900. - That's our last 900. - You want to bet or not. - You don't got a thousand? I'll make it 900. I'm a very charitable person. - Who do you wanna hold the bet? - Harry. You hold yours, I'll hold mine. Might as well, it's not going any place. You gotta bet. It's a pleasure taking your money, Sears. I don't know what a smart broad like that sees in that jerk. - Harry, just forget it. - See you around, Sears. Boss, I don't think that was such a good bet. Shut up, Jerome. 'Your attention please. The MGM lion' 'is presently available for photographs in the shopping..' 'Never seen lady wrestling before.' 'That man gave me a free T-shirt.' 'Would you, look at that picture of Big Mama.' 'Nah, I think it's a tag team.' 'Yeah, like the American Championship.' 'Those girls are beautiful.' 'I don't think they're that pretty.' 'I think you're jealous.' Quit givin' me a hard time about these tickets. Come on.' - Cisco. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Cisco. - Hey, Eddie. Big Mama wants to see ya. What's the matter, your mother drop you on ya head, huh? Well, explain it to me. What the hell is goin' on around here? All I see since I've gotten here is California Dolls. California Dolls T-shirts. California Dolls posters. I'm the star of this show, Eddie. Yes, sweetheart, you are, you are. You, how come you never thought of selling a poster of me? I don't know, I never thought of it. You should have. Lot of guys like voluptuous women. Isn't that right? What do you think of me in a wet T-shirt? I'm working on it. Keep workin'. 'I have a telephone call for..' - Good luck, Harry. - Yeah, thanks. Come on, come on, come on.. 'I have a telephone call for..' - Good luck, Harry. - Yeah, right. 'Merry Christmas.' Merry Christmas, George. 'The MGM lion is presently available for photographs..' Put those in the bin. Hurry! - Did somebody knock? - 'It's Eddie Cisco.' You go on first. Alright, we'll be late. I want my girls to make an entrance. Just don't make an exit with the 900 or else my friend might do to you what someone did to my car. Eddie, I don't know what you're talkin' about. I kinda think you do. I'll see you ladies ringside. Alright, girls. Look, I've got some business. You two get dressed. But keep this door locked. What's the matter, Mol? You nervous? Who, me? Yeah, I never seen you like this before a match. Yeah, well, tonight's a little different. I'm working without a net. What are you talking about? I've been cold turkey for two whole days. Haven't you even noticed? My God, Molly, I've been so excited about the match I never even noticed. That's terrific. I thought I'd see if I needed that junk for self-confidence. You can do it. I know you can. You know what else? We're gonna win tonight. I feel it. Well, let's hope you're right, partner. 'Cause this is it. Once again, number one, back in...base. Number three...finished. 'I have a telephone call for Mr. Taylor.' 'Mr. Michael Taylor, please.' 'You are the champions, and The California Dolls' 'are greedy for your title, hungry for your money' 'and you whipped their ass in Chicago' 'so now, they're going to be fighting for pride as well.' So, remember, pride, hunger, greed ooh, they got it all. We want the Dolls! We want the Dolls! Perfect. We don't have to do that again. Alright, what's next? Oh, very important. What's in it for you kids? Forty dollars a head. Fair enough? Alright. Now the song. Very important, here with the song. We want everybody to sing this song. So look at your sheets, fellas. I am going to give you a signal. Hey, pay attention here. You too. 'Cause I'm going to give you a signal. Here's the signal. When I go like this, what does that mean? Hey...what does this mean? You don't know, 'cause I didn't tell you. Alright, when I go like this here, you all gonna sing. Do it. 'Cigars, cigarettes, cigars, cigarettes..' And now, live from Reno, Nevada. We're very proud to be part of a special sporting event tonight in conjunction with Spectacular Sports Incorporated. 'Hello again, everybody, I'm Chick Hearn' 'We're ringside of the MGM Grand Hotel here in Reno' 'and tonight, KGIM has for you' 'not one, but two championship wrestling bouts. 'In our main event we're going to have Big Mama defending' 'her world women's heavy weight wrestling championship' 'and she'll be sorely tested tonight by Superstar.' 'In our semi-final tonight, we're going to have' 'The North American Tag Team Championship.' 'And that's gonna pit the champions, the Toledo Tigers' 'against the pride of Southern California' 'The California Dolls.' 'And speaking of the Dolls and the Tigers.' 'They've wrestled twice before, not for a title' 'but twice before. Each has won a match.' 'That means this is a grudge match, doesn't it?' Well, tonight ladies and gentlemen it's safe to say that this match is for all the marbles. 'We're getting ready, Harry.' Let's go now to the PA announcer. He's gonna introduce to you a very nice man. 'Ladies and gentlemen.' 'The MGM Grand Hotel in Reno, Nevada' 'takes pride and great pleasure' 'in introducing you to our guest ring announcer for tonight' Okay, we are all set. Defensive captain of the four time world champion 'Pittsburgh Steelers Mr. Joe Greene.' 'Known to many of his opponents..' '...as Mean Joe Greene.' Joe, the Boys' Club thank you a lot. I think on or off the football field he represents his sport as well as any man in the history of football. Two arch rivals of Tag Team wrestling will meet in a grudge match to decide which team is the North American Champions. 'Under the rules of the Nevada Athletic Commission' 'there will be a 30 minute time limit.' And in the event of a draw the Toledo Tigers will retain their title. Prize. $10,000. Myron, the.. Myron, I'm the star. They're at $10,000. Listen, they gotta fill up the card, you see. - They gotta fill-- - That's some filler. The referee for tonight's card.. ...Bill Dudley. Fighting to retain their North American title as the champion tag team in a world of wrestling from Toledo, Ohio the toughest the roughest pair of street fighters in the business, the Toledo Tigers. - We're number one. - Yeah. 'We're the Champs!' 'Let's hear it for the Toledo Tigers!' They're out here in Reno, Nevada tonight. And they wanna take back those championship belts with them. - Will they do it? - 'We're the Tigers.' Plus $10,000 to Big John Stanley, their manager. Only time will tell. As they make their way, they exude absolute confidence. 'We're number one. Yeah, yeah.' 'Woo!' Haven't seen you since Pittsburg. You're looking great today. Watch my girls, they're gonna burn down this place tonight. - Yes, indeed. - See ya. Do you like the Tigers? Are we number one? The challengers from Los Angeles, California. The hottest tag team in the country. The best looking girls in the ring today. The California Dolls. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. The California Dolls. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. Something odd going on here, ladies and gentlemen. Joe Greene introduced the California Dolls some time ago. Especially when you're on TV when you get that introduction you're supposed to come down and get into the ring. But they have not made an appearance. Have not hit the ramp into the ring. Oh come, Myron, what's the delay? I haven't got all night Get 'em on. Where are they? 'Where could the Dolls be?' 'Knowing Harry Sears, this could be a deliberate delay' 'trying to get the champion's goat.' We want the Dolls. 'I tell you this, if it's staged, it's having an effect.' 'A few minutes ago the champions were kidding' 'with the people around ring side.' 'Now, ladies and gentlemen they're not kidding at all.' 'They are mad.' - Where are the dolls? - They're chicken. All I got to tell you right now is I think the champions have been upstaged. 'They look pretty tough.' 'And mean.' That's right, and mean. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. We want the Dolls. 'We want the Dolls.' ? Oh, you beautiful Dolls ? ? You great big beautiful Dolls ? ? Let me put my arms around you ? ? I could never live without you ? ? Oh, you beautiful Dolls ? ? You great big beautiful Dolls.. ? ? You great big beautiful Dolls ? ? Let me put my arms around you.. ? It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen. Dazzling costume. - They look pretty good.. - You bet your ass. Dolls do look pretty good, boss. Shut up, Jerome. ? If you'd ever leave me, how my heart would ache ? ? I want to hug you, but I fear you'd break ? ? Oh! Oh!.. ? - Sing kids. Sing your little hearts out. You're worth every penny. 'Yeah!' - Rhinestones. - Yeah! Yeah, with those wings, they look like virgin vampires. I see it, but I don't believe it. 'Yeah! Those girls suck!' ? If you ever leave me, how my heart would ache ? ? I want to hug you, but I fear you'd break ? ? Oh, oh, oh, oh ? ? Oh, you beautiful Dolls ? Well, I'll get your knee pack. They love you. - You gotta get those wigs off? - Oh, yeah. This is ridiculous, Get 'em off, already. The outfits were just sensational. Yeah. Gotta spend money to make one. You talk about a choreographed entrance. 'Can't wrestle in that.' I'm not gonna drink this light beer anymore. Get me a real beer? I want a clean fight. No punchin'. 'Everybody clear on that?' 'Now, ladies. If you're fouled inside the ring 'you get a count of five.' 'Outside the ring but on apron, a count of ten.' 'Outside on the floor, a count of 20.' Is that understood? Now, managers.. ...let's get this shit off of our girl's faces, alright? This a wrestling match, it's not a vaudeville show. How do I see if they're cut with all that crap on their faces? Let's go. You got 30 seconds. And this crowd really getting behind it getting with it here in Reno, Nevada, now. There's only one way you gonna win, tonight. That's if you want it more than they do. Just play it straight and keep cool. We're the better team. And remember, you gotta beat 'em. If it's a draw, they're still champs. Win or lose, I love you both. But we come too far to lose. Go get 'em. - And whatever happens.. - It's gonna happen. Referee, Bill Dudley, says wrestle. 'Okay.' 'No problem. Not the end of the world.' Yeah. 'That'll be a start.' 'Oh-ho, what a beginning.' Beautiful, honey. Alright, shift. - 'Come on..' - You were never better, honey. Get her, Molly, get her. - Get back in there, Molly. - Is this exciting? 'I'd pay to see this, and I'm cheap.' Get up, Diane. - Diane, get up. - Let it all hang out. - Watch that choke, Doll.. - That's it. 'Toledo Tigers. My ass.' Holy moly. What a move. Alright, now stop grandstanding. Let's wrestle. - Watch that choke underneath. - Don't choke. - Shut up. - Ref, she's choking her. 'How long you been dead?' Ah! One more time baby. Hey, they're both in there! June and Diane, both in there.. Now, the Tigers are winning. Now, they'll kill 'em. Get out, I say. Hey, Manager. You gotta get one of these.. One, two.. Hey, this is bullshit. There's too many girls in the ring. Girls, you know better than that. They set up London bridge. - Ow. - Ow. The London bridge comes tumblin' down. Oh, God. What are you doing? Making a circus out of this? 'This is the greatest fight in history.' Out. 'Smart guy, huh?' 'That's the way. We'll show them.' Watch her hair, Tiger. Not the end of the world. Don't rush. Where's your pompom? Get this man a pompom. He's the promoter.' Let's stop grandstanding. Let's wrestle.' How'd you like it so far, Ed? 'Hey, Eddie, no pompoms?' 'Push out of it, June.' 'Choke hold, ref. Choke hold!' - That's a choke. - No choke. 'Look at this.' - Oh! - 'Oh!' 'Oh, take your breath away.' Oh. Hey, look at that. Take her out, honey. You got her. 'She got her now.' 'She'll take her out, now.' - 'Oh, shit.' - 'Come on, Molly.' 'Get up.' That hurt Molly. She hit the deck very, very hard. - Ha-a-air. - I'll call it, I'll call it. 'Okay, send her home, baby, send her home.' And lookie here. Fasten your seatbelts. It's the airplane ride. Look for the landin' strip. This is one hell of a fight. Molly rolls right into June and reversed that airplane spin 'into a possible pin.' 'Roll out.' Hey, ref, Hey, Bill. 'What's your name? Bill or Phil?' 'What's the difference? How long ya been dead?' One, two, three. 'Look out, June.' One, two.. You're robbin' us. Everybody's so calm. What do you mean calm. Get back in that corner. And referee Dudley's stuck. It looked like he had a chance to go for the third cap. That's exactly what Iris is hollerin'. Get off the ropes! Watch it, ref, she's on the ropes! 'Finish her off, Diane.' 'Diane's using a double eye..' 'She's gouging her eyes.' 'That's it, Diane. Don't stop now.' 'Pin her, Diane. Pin her.' Come on, are you mute? Call it, you dog. - Get in the corner. - 'Get her, Diane.' 'Ha-a-air.' Call it. What's going on here? 'Ref, she's stamping on her hair.' Hey, call it, would you? It's beginning to stink here. 'Hey, ref, I know a fish when I smell one.' Here's a great wrestling hold. Diane has Molly in a figure four head scissors. That's ropes, God damnit. And the referee is more now intent on arguing with Harry the manager of the California Dolls and Iris over in the corner than he is refereeing the match. Manager, get down. Get down from there. Get down! I don't give a damn! There's a lot of money involved here. Sears is up screaming. He's got a five down. He's got to get down those steps or face disqualification. - Break it up. - She's hanging on the rope. - Do your job. - Get out. You bonehead! I'll tell you. Don't come over here I'll take this bag. I'll shove it right up your ass. - Choke! Choke! - Not a choke. No, not a choke. Watch it. Go get her, baby. Go get her. Careless. The crowd sees what you're doing. It's not a secret. And so does your mother. Some of the fans have started yelling for the dark suited Toledo Tigers, early in the evening have now switched their allegiance over to the white-clad California Dolls. Get over there. Get in that corner. Go. The California Dolls asserting themselves now. That a way, Molly. 'Get up, June. Roll out!' Count, you son of a bitch. He could've tapped them out four or five times. Hey, you son of a bitch, that's bullshit. 'What's going on here?' We had the fight. The fight was ours. Boy, that guy, Dudley. I don't know about him. I'm getting suspicious myself, but that's not for me I guess, to allege. Just scared. - 'What's that ref up to?' - I don't know what he's doing. Okay. Oh, shit. You got to get up, Molly. Watch the fight, you monkey. 'June hits Molly with a punishing clothesline.' 'Down she goes.' Ah! She's out. 'Hair! Call it. Call it, you monkey!' 'Come on, June. Finish her off.' You baldhead, the kid is getting killed in there. - 'Her hair.' - Hair! Call it. 'Over here, baby. Bring her to me!' What's going on? You buy the referee? No way, baby, no. Uh-uh. Smells bad to me, John. This fight is fixed. No way to win. Just knock the referee on his ass. Son of a bitch has.. Yeah, okay. Knock the shit out of the referee. You'll get yours. - One, two.. - Don't forget. I'll tell you, don't come here I'll take this bag. I'll shove it up your ass. You alright? She stepped back. Iris missing that second dropkick and down goes Iris on her wallet. - 'Hey, John. Hey, John.' - 'That's right. Finish her.' - 'John, is this on a level?' - 'I don't even know the bum.' Hair hair hair, you freak, hair. 'Get back in that corner. I say, get back in that corner.' Oh, they placed Iris up on there like a cadaver on a slab. A two hand slam to the midsection. You get a chance, you go hit that referee flat on his ass. You're going to get yours, pimp. Get back in the corner. Get back in the corner. Molly, fighting back this time. She's a raging hellcat over there. - Stay in the corner. - Let me go in. 'Let me in.' Iris, I think is totally out now. 'Break it up. She can't breathe.' One, two.. Can't you see what's going on? Diane and June have Iris in on a leg choke. Sometimes, this is called the old rockin' horse and sometimes it's used for submission. 'You just can't breathe.' 'Harry, make them stop! I can't stand it.' Only 15 minutes left, ladies and gentlemen. And Iris.. That's the best you looked all night. Watch that fight, you junkie. Watch that fight. 'Enough is enough, you asshole. Break it up.' Alright, tag up. 'Hang in there, Iris, hang in there.' Call it, you monkey. Come on. Give me a break. 'Would you gimme a call?' 'This is a disgrace. This is entirely a goddamn disgrace.' One, two.. Come on, baby. They've got the referee pinned. They playing yankee doodle dandy with his head. Get along, baby. Yeah. That's right. You want water? A pillow? How about another shot in the ass? That's the answer, Iris. Knock the shit out of him. 'Diane..' Ladies and gentlemen, it's chaotic. Oh, at the keister bout. Oh-h. Stay on the ropes. Watch those ropes. Damn right, you son of a bitch.. Forget the rope. Get out of there. California Dolls. 'Let's hear it for The Dolls.' - Don't double dribble her. - We're back in the fight. I would say 75% of this throng now is for the white-suited California Dolls. No, don't do it again. Please don't. Don't do it. 'Take her out' Come on, tag up. Tag. You blind son of a bitch. Go get her, Iris. Tag up. You wanted it hot. You want.. You wanted a brawl? Alright. Get out of there. Ow! The Dolls appear to have taken things in their hands. They're lambasting referee Bill Dudley every chance. What the.. Oh! - 'What are you doing?' - You wanted a brawl? Fine. 'Get your hands off my wrestler.' You want a.. You want a brawl. We'll turn it into a massacre! Anybody with a weak heart, leave. Watch that elbow. Out of the ring. Get out of the ring. The crowd is going berserk. 'The California Dolls have picked up followers' 'from the minute this fight started.' Stay away from 'em. We got time on our side. Let go of me, ref. Let go of me. Ow! Time running out. We tie, we lose. Ref, she's got my hair. Goddamn suckers. One, two, three.. Do it again. Hit 'em! That's it! Under 2 minutes to go in this championship bout. It's at a fever pitch! - 'Interference here.' - Iris! Fourteen. A startling development. All four wrestlers are outside the ring, failing away. Ouch. June, just slam-dunked Iris and Iris comes up bloody. Three, two.. You're hopeless, you son of a bitch. ...11, 12.. - One.. - Not anymore! Not anymore! '...three' 'four' Alright. We got 'em. Seven. We can still win this thing. Got over a minute. 'Get 'em again. Take 'em out.' And The Dolls are catapulted off the apron by a double shoulder butt. - 'One, two..' - Yeah. Less than a minute to go. '...four..' 'Iris..' 'Oh, God, she's bleeding.' 'They fought against sunset flips.' Oh-h! A double sunset flip. I don't believe it. 'Count, you son of a bitch.' - Either one or both? - I don't give a shit. Count. The referee doesn't know what to do. Kids, count! One, two, three.. One, two, three. 'One, two, three.' 'One, two, three.' 'One, two, three.' 'One, two, three.' 'One, two, three.' 'One, two, three.' 'One, two, three.' Total happiness in Reno, Nevada. You can't get away with this. I'm gonna protest. Ha ha ha. There were too many people in that-- 'I know. There's nothing we can do about it.' They looked pretty good. Coach, you alright? Alright, you were the champions three minutes ago and you gonna be the champions three months from now. Now, behave like it. Go over there and congratulate 'em. Go on. 'Oh, God, Iris, I can't believe it.' Congratulations. Thank you. You're wonderful wrestlers. We are the best! Champions! We did it! We did it! What a night! What a fight! The winners...and new tag team champions of North America.. ...The California Dolls. Thanks, Joe. ? California here I come ? ? Right back where I started from ? So proud. ?
