(melancholy music) TWISTED (laughter from the video) (Hannah speaks in the video) (melancholy music continues) (leaves rustling, laughter) (machine beeps) Hey, guess what I did today? I checked out hotels on Maui. Little getaway. Wait, you don't want to go to Hawaii? Yes, but we were just in Florida last month. (sighs) Moving Grandma into a care home is hardly my idea of fun. Mhm. Not a vacay. Ouch!...Oh God. My back, it hurts so bad. A little lower, darling To the right... There? Lower... Ah, yes, yes... Right there... mhm... You gonna ask her? Yeah, I got it. (car door slams) Hey! Hey!..The lasagna was so good. - Yeah, you tried the vegetarian? - Yeah So, I did something wild with my hair. What do you think? Wow! Should I shock the teacher with it? Yeah! Oh!..We're going night hunting, do you wanna come? Hunting? Yeah, party afterwards... I think Andy's coming, too. - Hold on, it's my mom. - Ok, I'll see you in class. Hello? Is she? I'm working on it, dude. Guess what color my hair is! I don't care. Hannah...honey, you need to stay away from that girl. She was arrested last year at the protest. She's dangerous! By the way, you left your coat in the car, I'll come back. ..Ok. - "This week we'll access our subconscious through doodling." - (Victor and Josh chatting inaudibly) Once we start drawing the triangle, we don't want to lift our hand. Hey, is it true, her and Andy? - "This is our subconscious spontaneity drawing". - I don't know. We're going to start with triangles... and please, don't lift your hand. Let me show you. (slow pop song starts playing) NO TRESPASSING (sound of footsteps on leaves and branches) Yeah, I think I see it. Alright, let's shoot. (gun shot) Oh shit! INAUDIBLE Oh my God! (excited chatter) Yeah, go baby! (they howl like wolves) (gun shot) Fuck, that sounded close. (another gun shot) Let's go! (knocks at the door) Hannah! Blackberry pie, right out of the oven! Thanks. Ooh. Wow! You're really in a memory lane mood, aren't you? (Silvia chuckles) Oh God, I haven't seen this little guy in a while! Yeah, I found him in the basement. Teddy bear, teddy bear...Turn around... Remember him? Bunny rabbit (laughs) Teddy bear, teddy bear, touch the ground! Teddy bear, teddy bear (both) ..show your shoe (Silvia) "Teddy bear, teddy bear..." (Hannah) Bunny rabbit, bunny rabbit... (both) ..that will do. Why did you bring that old box out anyway? It's art week. Don't they have crayons at school? Yeah, but I like Dad's. Ok... Alright, let me know how that pie tastes. Ok. (door closes) Open it. Little bit longer here. Yeah, exactly. And then, down and around here... slowly. (music and conversation in the background) Yeah, exactly. I gotta ask... she any good? Drop it. She's cute. Alright? Let's finish this up, c'mon. (ominous music slowly swelling) Mom, you're still up? There's somebody out there. (ominous music continues to build) Listen. I don't see anybody. It's probably that tall, skinny phony pony lurking about. (machine gun fire and explosion noises from the TV) We'll have to turn him over. Hold on. Here we go. Jeez! Looks like the bullet went straight through him. Cap', I think I got something! What do you think? .41 Magnum slug. (ominous music swelling) (door opening) Sorry, I didn't know if you'd left. (office noises in the background) Mike was just in to identify his son. He signed the documents you prepared. Thank you, sweetie. At least he was sober today. Anything else you need, honey? Does she know? (sighs) God, I hope not. I want be there for her when she finds out. Hannah? Hannah? Hey! How was your day? Ok. Come here. Did you hear what happened today? What? Well, there's a... There's no easy way to tell you this. They... found Andy's body down by the mine... ..brought him by the clinic. Is he gonna make it, Mom? No... The Sheriff said that, since you were friends, they'd like to ask you a few questions. Mom, I'm not talking to anybody! "We weren't that close anyway." Hannah... "I'm so sorry Hannah..." "We'll get through this, honey." It's a beautiful pie, thank you! Thank you, Hannah made that. She's a real talent. This is really good, Hannah. You should send me the recipe. But I don't think I can make it as good. Now...I just...thought that since you and Andy were close... (Hannah)"We weren't that close." (Silvia)"That's right, people talk." Yep, I mean they sure do, but...(sighs) When did you last have contact with Andy? A couple of days ago. And was that in person, or on the phone? In person. Do you know Andy's friends well? No. (door crashes open) Andy's been shot! What? He's dead, guys. Look, the police are everywhere, we'll get into trouble! Just... Help me out here. I gotta get this back. Take care of our babies. I will. (suspenseful music, fast footsteps) (police sirens in the background) (inaudible conversation outside) "How has your hunting business been this season?" I purchased 2000 tags, so... Yeah, there was a lot of hunting going on this year. "Well, perhaps you can shed some light on that." Yeah, actually... This is a unique bullet, I'll show you... "It's a..." You've got quite the gun collection, huh? My father's old Winchester. "Has this been used recently?" Well, I'm not sure, actually... (sucks his teeth) My handyman, erm, he has access to this case. "I give him five tags a year, so he may have used it." "I want to thank you for your cooperation." Yeah. - Thank you very much - No problem. Thank you. I can't... I can't really talk right now, Victor. Jesus. (knocks on the door) What the fuck? Come on, downstairs. Dad. Hey. "Here... just give me a hand please." You know these axes aren't meant for this kind of wood? Well... pretty much figured... that. But we mostly need to talk about the hunting accident. (Victor sighs) You think we can just come here, chop wood and be buddies? Look, I'm trying, it's a start. Yeah, it's been 18 years, Dad. Now is not the time. Victor! "Just go spend time with your new bitch, Dad!" Just give me a minute, alright? Hannah! Where are you? I'm biking, Mom! Honey, what are you doing? Pumping my bike. If you pump your bike, you'll be late. No, I'll take a shortcut. Oh, let me drive you. Then how will I get home? (dark song starts playing) be my many and my only help me forget be my many and my only help me forget come on baby can you wait til morning... (song fades out) "Hey." They say I'm the last one to see him alive. I'm really sorry... about Andy. I can't... I can't imagine how you feel. Officer Hogan? Jamal Abdi. "Jamal Abdi." If it's an unintentional act, you may not even know it's your bullet. He was wearing a brown leather jacket. Officer Wyatt, I want you to take this man to get his eyesight examined. Sir, I need to take you to the health clinic for an eye exam. (Silvia sighs, moans) Feels so good. Hannah, meet me at the fabric store tomorrow after school. Why? You need proper curtains. There's not even a road out there. Hannah! The hunters come through here all the time, sweetie. You wanna show them your big boobies? Speaking of breasts... ..you gained weight. I don't think so. (Silvia sighs) Are you pregnant? Mom! Yeah, circle your fists sweetie... good. "I don't know how many snakes you're inviting into your cave." Hannah! Hannah! Hannah. "Good girl." "Up the duff negative." "See you next month." Hey. "Hey." Why don't you have this. Protects you against your enemies. "Why?" Red Jasper. Just keep it on you. Hey Hey, I almost left. Sorry, I have a quiz tomorrow. On? Doodling. Doodling... Look at this light green. I like this, what do you think? I don't like it. Oh, I love it! Oh! What about this one? Doodling... Yeah, it's like subconscious drawing. - Subconscious? - I like this one! (hesitates)... "It's pretty masculine, sweetie." - No it's not. - (cellphone chimes) Ok... dang it. Yeah, that's the clinic. I gotta go. Ok, look. Oh please, anything but this dreadful brown? And pick up some milk and potatoes before you go home, ok? (tense music, slowly swelling) (music intensifies) (music peaks, Hannah breathes heavily) Would you help me with these vegetables? I'm not hungry. 'Course you're hungry. Hannah, where are you going? - Honey, I hate eating alone, come on - I know Sweetie, I know you're upset. I understand, but... I'm tired. I hope you understand that. I just need to be alone, ok? (tense music playing) Look what Daddy brought you... ..pheasant feathers. You can hang them up... ..you can dress up like a bird... (footsteps approaching) Hey honey. I saw that. Give me your hand. Pussy. (sound of a car engine) (cheering and laughter from the car) (suspenseful music) (sounds of conversation inside) - Hannah. You made it! - Are you ok? Hey. Welcome to our secret hunting society. Nobody can know about us, you understand? I know your mom's a doctor, you... You think you could get us some scalpels? Ok. Cool... scalpels! Do you guys wonder about Andy? No, they say it's Victor's handyman. Really? Yeah, hunting accident. You look like you could use a drink. Got these back from the doctor. She said he can't really see anything past 70 yards. Says he lost his left eye in a grenade attack. (sewing machine clanking) "Mom, you're up?" Yes honey, I waited for hours! "Where are my pictures of Dad?" Basement, honey, nothing's lost. That's not what I bought. Well, sweetie, if you'd been home... "I don't like those flowers." Hannah, I'm sitting here, darling, in the middle of the night, making you a curtain. Just...try and hang it, darling... We'll see who's right. Come on Hannah, they're right here. Get the rod, darling. Hannah? Come! What've you been up to anyway, darling? I was sitting by Dad's place. Glad you came back. My special child. Thanks, Mom. You're welcome, darling. Can I ride with you tomorrow morning? Sure! Really a gorgeous day. Okay. Bye. (uptempo song playing) (doors slamming shut) Sorry, I wasn't able to finish. (uptempo song picks up again) I'll be watching your face, I'll be watching you fade didn't want it, but I made it didn't like it, but I ate it devastation chasing me got twisted in my own sheets I miss you if you call I wouldn't answer I'll be hidin' under the covers watchin' your face what's it gonna be baby, I'm straight right ready what's it gonna be baby, I'm straight right ready what's it gonna be baby, I'm straight right ready point to a shooting star and make me wonder point to a shooting star and maybe one day you could be in my heart (gun shot) it'd be a fun day, fun day... Pick it up. point to a shooting star and make me wonder point to a shooting start, and maybe one day you could be in my heart, it'd be a fun day, fun day... Let's go! (song fades out) fun day, fun day... Come on, I'll show you. I got it. Come, Hannah. You ok Victor? So... these are a little sloppy, but I think we can make earrings out of them. - Til death? - Til death. Ok? You'll take the scalpel... ..and you'll cut the bird from up here... ..all the way down. You have to break the skin, so really go for it. You'll have to go under the breast. Ok... Now set the scalpel down, I'll hold it open for you you'll reach past the liver... and then the heart is right on top. Would you like to give me his heart? Now that you've given me his heart you get to ask me one question. "Why did you give Andy one of your claws?" "How do you have that?" "Wait - Raven." You and Andy? Mad it wasn't you? Hannah! "Hannah!" Go away! "Hannah!" Did you call me? "Do you mind, sweetie? I am so sore." (eerie music swelling) "Don't even try. Not talking about it." Thanks for fucking that up. "Quit whining, you didn't have a chance with her anyways." "Not now! Not anymore, thanks to you." "Jeez!" "Poor Josh. How long has he been begging for that claw?" "I think you're begging, right." Ah, shit. "Raven!" "Raven, Victor!" "Right behind!" What's up? "Why are you late? We've been taking this class for a year." - Look, Hannah, I'm really sorry about -I don't want your help. I was just sex, it didn't mean anything! You crazy bitch! What is your fucking problem?! You are a fucking psycho! What the fuck! She cut me! You beat the shit out of her. You're a little crazy, huh. I'm a little crazy, too. Listen, I want to show you something. (dramatic, gloomy song playing) Take me to the river take me to the water take me, take me to the river I want to swim no more wading in shivers up the skin headfirst is the only way to break that glassy bend (song fades out) (the same song from before, now as soft piano music) (song lyrics) Take me to the river take me to the water take me, take me to the river I want to swim (song fades out) Here you go. And here are the documents you requested. Good girl. I also checked on those details on Hannah's father like you asked me to. Yeah? They said he drowned as his car slid into the river. I remember that. Horrible accident down at the old 49 bridge. But it is strange they didn't find any water in his lungs, isn't it? Yeah... so you're saying...he was already dead when he went into the river? Looks like it. "This report says this was a medical autopsy." "Did...nobody request a forensic?" (sighs) Hey. I have to go. I can walk you out. (brooding music) (sound of an approaching car) Looks like you're in a bit of trouble. (engine idling) Get in. Get in! I don't mean to be unfriendly, but this is the first week of the hunting season and you're not wearing your vest? (car doors close) Where to? Uhm, I live at the end of Coyote Road. Perfect. Just who I thought you were. Look. You tell your mother I want another test done. This time with a less biased doctor. So. Who is she protecting? You? (iron hissing) Hannah! Where have you been? I've been...driving around, looking for you for hours. I'm 18, you don't have to go looking for me, Mom. Your phone is shut off, why? 'Cause I wanted privacy. Hannah... I think you're omitting some important information here. I'm not omitting anything. Your new friend? I don't have any friends, Mom. Honey, this...student is admitted to the clinic today, and I'm called in to sew up her eyebrow because my daughter has attacked her. According to this girl, you're her new best friend. I'm tired. Hannah, please come down here and sit down. - I wanna go to my room! - No, your room is being redone sweetheart. And it is a serious offence to hurt somebody to the extent that they need stitches, Hannah. "She said she's helping you find out who killed Andy." Mom, I said nothing's going on. Nothing! (sinister music playing) Drawing reveals a lot, Hannah. You mind telling me what's going on? As your mother, I will always... ..defend and protect you. Is there anything on...Andy's death you haven't told me? Trying to help you, Hannah! The police have a different version, and... ..I would hate it if they find these drawings... They might take you in for a test. Test, what kind of test? It's a lie detector. I'm trying to protect you, Hannah. Possibly from yourself, too. Mom, they're just drawings. Let's get rid of them. Hannah! There are those, who... ..suppress that they have murdered. Because the knowledge is unbearable. Very common in fact. "The brain's capacity..." "..for denial..." Don't speak in that tone! "You need treatment, darling." (eerie music intensifies) "Let me in, Hannah" (makes soothing noises) (noise of the bike crashing on the floor) (intensifying dramatic noise) Alright. I gotta go. "You aren't going to the funeral?" "No, I tried to get the day off, but the boss won't let me." Just lost my ride, huh? "But..." ..if I was your boyfriend... ..maybe I could pull a few strings. Get off. Hannah just texted me, I'll go with her. Her mom's gonna give us a ride. "That's good." "Glad she's reaching out." "I'll see you later." "Hi!" Sorry I'm late! Thank you so much for picking me up. Glad you could come. How's Hannah doing? She's better. "We'll pick her up next." So...how do you like being a doctor? (sinister tone swelling) Yeah...I'm studying biology, so I'm not quite sure what I want to do, but... ..I like animals, so maybe a vet? "Come on in!" "Hannah is upstairs!" (suspenseful music) Hannah? "Sorry, she's down here!" Hannah? "In the kitchen!" My battery's dead. Can I borrow your phone? It's been hard on all of us. Yeah, we'll be ok. What was that? "Go sit in the car while I find out where Hannah is." I - I need my phone. "Go sit in the car I said." What did you give me? (dramatic percussive music) (Raven panting) (Raven whimpering) Hey, where's Raven? Where is Raven? Hannah! Where the fuck - where is Raven? Hannah! "Hey! Where is Raven?" Dude! What? Just let her mourn. "But Raven was supposed to be here today." "Raven doesn't really care about these things." - "Just give her a minute" - "Ok." Hey. "I'm sorry." "Don't worry. Do you know where Raven is?" No, I don't know. "Ahm but she said, she got a message from you?" Then she lied. "Well..." "Ok, can I...just see you phone?" "I'm sorry." Ok. Uhm... I don't have my phone. "What?" "Where is it?" "I don't know." Come over here for a second...please. "Hard day, huh?" You holdin' up ok though? Yeah, I guess. Listen...if it's ok with you... I'd love...to just have a little chat in my office, just you and I. Why? I just have a few questions, that... ..may relate to your dad's accident. I don't know anything. "You can come by after class if you'd like." You know where my office is, right? Mhm. Ok. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go look for my phone. I'll let you know if Raven called, ok? Thank you! Hannah. Can I go with you? No...I'll... ..I'll call you when I find my phone, ok? Ok. Hello, sweetie. How was it? I think it's brilliant that you went. So good to get closure. I am making you your favorite cookie. Chocolate chip walnut. (eerie tones, intensifying) The funeral made me miss Dad. No more sad talk, honey, I can't handle it. We're starting a new chapter today. Together. Just the two of us. "Oh, you love these." Ok...Come on, sit with me for a little bit. Before I have to go to work. Tell me who was there, ok? Try these cookies, they're...piping hot. Everyone was there. Huh. Even the sheriff. Oh? Captain Hogan Donaldson? No, the other one. Wyatt? Did he, uhm... Did he say anything? No. We, uh... You know, I think we...we need to leave this place. (Silvia mumbles) "I can get work anywhere." Anywhere in the world, actually. I don't wanna go. Go ahead, eat your cookie, sweetie. I have to go to work, and... ..I'll be back in...in an hour or so. Ok? Thanks Mom. "Hannah called and said that you'd been out on the...lake all day, fishing together." Yeah...and? "I'm just stating the obvious." "What are you accusing me of?" I'm going to report you. "Report me for what?" What do you two do when you go fishing all day? I am not your perverted father! "Get your fucking little dirty hands off me" (sinister string music) (dial tone) "Hey it's Raven, I'm probably doing something way more important than you are. Leave a message" Thank God you're here, we have a kid with a peanut allergy, looks like. Her pulse ox is low. She started to wheeze a little, she had a PB&J about 15 minutes ago. Give her a .5 Epi - which room is she in? Three. Alright, gimme a minute, I'll be there. God, these...fucking hillbillies... ..feeding their kids peanuts, on Saturday night. (baby crying in the background) By the way... ..have...you noticed what's been happening between Victor and Hannah? No? I saw them kissing. Hannah's sick. She is? How? I fear she's spiraling into another psychosis. I see the symptoms. Oh my God, I'm - I'm so sorry! She can be dangerous. I would warn Victor if I were you. "Victor, listen to me..." "I'm so sorry, I didn't - I didn't know." "Wow, and...nobody knew?" Uhm... So, I've been thinking a lot... ..and... ..I wanna go talk to the sheriff. It would mean a lot to me if you came. I don't know, Hannah. Why are you being like this? "Like what?" Cold. You've been acting a bit erratic lately. Erratic? Yeah. Maybe after the treatment. What treatment? Hannah, your mom says you're going away for treatment. If anyone needs treatment, it's my mom. She's a doctor, they treat themselves, unfortunately. Exactly. She's a doctor. She knows who's sick, and who's not. Look, I'll be here when you get back, ok? (suspenseful music swelling) Oh, you are home. That's Dad's rifle. Where are you going? What do you need a rifle for? We might need it for protection. That's what you killed Andy with, isn't it? You have a sick imagination, darling. Mom, where is Raven? Who is Raven? Oh her, God, why would I know. Answer me. Honey. Come here. You get rid of everyone who's close to me! Oh! Hannah, I love you! Come here! I'm going, no! Where are you gonna go? Tell me, who's gonna take care of you? You're sick, darling, you're sick. No, I'm not! "Mom! Mom! Please, let me out, I'm sorry!" Fine, that's how you want it. (Hannah typing on her phone) (dialing tone) Hello? "Police, Wyatt speaking" "It's Hannah, help me" Hannah? Hannah, where are you? - (low battery tone) - Oh shit. (Hannah bangs on the door) Mom, please! Hannah... ..I want you to think about what you just did. (eerie tone) (doorbell rings) (knocks on door loudly) (sound of the front door opening) Hannah? "Please help" My mom has a gun! Where are you? "In the basement!" Hannah? "I'm over here!" Hannah! "I'm in here!" (suspenseful music) (gun shot, Hannah screams) "It's ok." "Hannah." (water running) That officer... ..he was coming to get you. Do you understand that? Honey. I have now... ..made myself a murderer... ..in order to protect your freedom. Do you understand? I understand. Ok. Go over there and put on that pretty little blouse. And your jacket, darling. It's just the two of us now, Hannah. Nothing...can come between us now. You understand that? Ok darling. I want you to take this bag to the car. I'm coming now. Here we go Hannah. This is a new beginning! We erase the past now. Feels great to be leaving. Where are we going, Mom? South? I feel like driving to the sun. Sun sounds great. I hope. Where do you wanna go, darling? I don't know, what do you wanna do? I wanna...wake up next to you, in a small hotel... ..we could order breakfast. That sounds great. Thank you for doing this for me, Mom. I missed you Hannah. I missed you, too, Mom. Mom, I have to go to the bathroom, could we stop before we get to the main road? Why didn't you think of that before we left, Hannah? Sorry, I forgot. Could we just stop really quick? No. No, we're driving now. Bunny rabbit, bunny rabbit... ..turn...around... Bunny rabbit, bunny rabbit, touch the ground. Bunny rabbit, bunny rabbit... (both) ..show your shoes... (both) Bunny rabbit, bunny rabbit... (Hannah) that was... Oh my God! "Hannah!" "Hannah! No!" (Silvia whimpering, suspenseful tones swelling) (threatening, animal-like noises) (Hannah screaming) Victor? Victor! "Hannah!" Hannah! Oh my God, what's happened to you? Is Victor here? "I...I just...Mom, my mom shot the Sheriff..." She did what? (breathing heavily) my mom, my mom shot a police officer, Mom's crazy! - "No, no, no, come here. Oh my goodness, you're freezing!" - My mom's crazy! - Because she's a doctor, they trust her, but really, she's the one who needs treatment. - Ok, have a seat. - She's trustworthy, but you can't... - Sit down. Calm down. Victor, come in here and help me, please. Just grab that blanket over there. Breathe in, ok? Be calm, there we go. She's crazy. Put it around her, nice and tight. Here you go. It's not my fault, it's my mom. - You want some tea? - It's not me. Stay right here, Victor, stay with Hannah. Thank you. It's... it's not me! - It's gonna be ok. - Alright, alright. (cacophonous string music) She shot him! She shot him. "Hannah, drink this, it'll do you good, ok?" There you go. You're welcome, sweetie. I just gave you a little something to help you relax. (distorted voice) Everything's gonna be alright. "Victor, come here and help me! Quickly, Victor, come on!" (distorted voices, noises) There we go. - "Did you poison me?" - "Of course not, I just gave you something to calm down, ok?" Calm down, calm down. (eerie, distorted sounds and voices) (phone ringing) "Dr. Hartman," hi. We have your daughter here. "I gave her something" "If you could just get Hannah here," I would really appreciate it. "Hey." Ok. - There you go. - Thank you. - What happened? - It's ok. She stabbed me. What?! Yeah, it's ok. It's alright. Do you need me to take you to the hospital? - You need to get that stitched up though! - I will, I will. Ok... Thank you guys. That's what we're here for. Now you be safe. Did you ask your dad for permission? Fuck you. (crickets, approaching footsteps) Changed your mind? Guess so. I need a drink. Let's go. "Raven?" "Raven, hey!" Raven! "Raven, hey! Hey!" "Guys?" "What the hell is going on?" "What did you do to her?" - "Nothing!" - "Move! Move!" Hey! You ok? Hey! What's her name? You know her? "Raven." Raven! Raven! "She's got a needle bruise on her neck!" (eerie music intensifies) Nothing to be afraid of, darling. Oh my God, no! (eerie beats increasing) (doorbell rings) You don't want him to die, so don't answer him. (Silvia screams) (glass shatters, Silvia screams) (Silvia screams with pain, whimpers) I don't want her to die. I'm so sorry. I see you. (sound of a gun being loaded and cocked) (suspenseful tone) (gun shot) (suspenseful tone intensifies, peaks) (water running) Everything's gonna be alright.
