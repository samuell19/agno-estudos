Shut up, huh?! Come on, Hannibal. Come on. - What did it give? - It gave... 1.87 and 2 pesetas. - 2 what? - 2 pesetas. - Nice people. - Ohh, I don't know. But it is always the beginning of the Mallorca journey. - (the dog beeps) - He is hungry. - How much do you have? - 6.32. Then it's off work. What will we do the day it becomes withholding tax? - Stick to the subject. YMCA or the Pitfall? - The pitfall. Come on, Hannibal. Come on, daddy's good dog. - Well, you're still sitting here, huh? - You guys are just relaxing, aren't you? - Then there's your dinner. - Thank you, Olga. Olga, my beautiful friend here you have us again. - 3 dinners and 2 drinks. - Do you have any money? - Olga, you know us then. - Yes, how many? How many? Should we miss a few, - - we can fix it as we usually do. Art for goods. Lovely girl, Olga. What food she can cook! The YMCA cannot be compared to that! Right, Hannibal? There's Valde! Olga, a dinner and a beer. - Hey. How are you? - Brilliant. - You also look satisfied. - Of course. I have neither a wife nor a child! - Where have you been? - Calm down. Now I'm here. - Well, cheers with you. - Cheers, Valde. There is a house available opposite me. Wasn't it for you? - A house? Are you insane! - Yes, it's no Beach estate, but can see the water. Nah, we live well. And for free. Nice address. Well, you have to decide for yourself. Isn't it about time you ordered some? - Bernard, you start us. - You're a hard employer. Make sure you don't pay entertainment tax. (piano) A small smile, a quiet hope cheek to cheek in love before the night is over two eyes laughs because they know that they have found two to reflect the joy in you are still a dream still but we will meet, you one fine day, somewhere then we'll find each other with a small smile a quiet hope everything we want that you and I can give day dreamers I'm living off it gives me everything I want to achieve the dream is the same time after time here I sit with my song a small smile a quiet hope cheek to cheek in love before the night is over two eyes laughs because they know that they have found two to reflect the joy in you are still a dream still but we will meet, you one fine day somewhere then we'll find each other with a small smile a quiet hope everything we want that you and I can give. - (clap) - Bravo! The age of miracles is not over go out yourself and take a look outside a sunshine warms you brown at your skin a bee buzzes around and a flower pops out the time of miracles is not over a sparrow happily squeeks on its melody you notice again that you can smile and laugh miracles, miracles can still happen. (clap) I laughed, it was glorious. It was a lovely evening. - Where should it be delivered? - Wasn't it Henriksen on third? Yes. Yes. The toothpick. The light. Ah, home again. We are having a great time here. To think, what we sacrificed on it. You, Bernhard... You know, what I pondered about? It's Thursday tomorrow. Shouldn't we go to the forest? Yes, we can do that very well. We have to do something for Hannibal. He has toiled at it all week. We can take a packed lunch with us. Olga gave us a packed lunch. Here... To Hannibal. Then we have to hope it's not beef bones like last time. - They were harder to chew. - Yes, do you remember that. Nah, whoa, whoa, you. My turn. Come up to dad. Good night. (snoring) - What time is it? - It's 7. Then it must have come. Be careful no one sees you. That was good, daddy's dog. What are two singles do with all that morning bread? - Rolls or spices? - Breakfast rolls. - Is there no Danishes? - Nah. Hannibal, come here. Remember the cream. Thank you Hannibal. Dad's good dog. Excellent invention. Hannibal, then you run down with it again. What's up, Hannibal? - (steps on the stairs) - Someone is coming. - It's just me. - Hey, my friend, come inside. Sit down. - What brings you here? - It's awful, it won't work anymore. I dare not let you stay here any longer. I think someone smelled the fuse. We are otherwise so careful. You must use your counter chamber as you wish. - You're the janitor in the property. - It's illegal. I'll be in trouble. - Nonsense! - Now it's summer too. Yes, there are excellent benches in the Oersteds Park! What about Hannibal? The sky express threw us out because of him. We report it to Animal Protection. See first paying the dog tax. Seriously, you have to get out of here as soon as possible. I have a letter for you... for you. I'm slipping. Lock after yourselves and come down with the key. - They are lacking the cream on fourth. - Oh. Shouldn't you open your letter? - I don't dare. - Perhaps it is joyful. It's from America. Why didn't you tell, you have a rich uncle in America. Open, maybe he's dead! I have no rich uncle in America. I have a sister. - Maybe she died? - Don't say that. Well, no, sorry. - What does she want then? - I can't know that. Can't you read it to me? "Dear Bernhard." "It's been ages since I've heard from you." "But you must be busy in your business." "After all, nobody comes to their money sleeping nowadays." "However, it's about time you took an interest in, -" "- what will happen to your children." - Your... your what?! - My children. - Do you have children? - Yes, two. They live with my sister in America. - Why? - Because my wife... - Do you also have a wife?! - I had a wife. A lovely girl... she died. - When? - 6 years ago. - When the last one was born. - You never said a word about it. You don't brag about giving up your children. - Why did you do it then? - I was completely devastated. So my sister offered to take them, while they were smalll... What else does she say? "Not a day goes by when they don't ask, -" "- when are they going back to their father in Denmark." "Since I understand that you are financially well off, -" " - I don't see what's stopping you from taking them home." "I will miss them, but they are so big now, -" " - that I can see nothing but that their place is with their father." - That is out of the question. - Why? Shall we take them to the sky express when we can't even have the dog with? - Oh no... - Does it say anything else? "Since I know how difficult it is for you to make a decision, - " " - I'll send them off on June 24 with Gripsholm,- " " - which arrives in Copenhagen on July 2nd." " Many warm greetings Ellen." I must... I must write to her. What date do we have today? I didn't know that. Hannibal, go down for a newspaper to dad. - That's good. - Yes, come with it. It is the 26th. They have sailed. He can't get it back through the crack! Then they must do without their newspaper just for today! Can dad borrow dad's dog's newspaper? - What are you looking for? - Apartment. - The children have to have a home to live in. - Where will we get the money? We'll have to see what it costs. House or apartment? We'll start with apartment. Oh, there are many. " 3-room apartment. Free surroundings. For rent immediately." Maybe they solved it without us noticing. " Trial apartment the Forest Park 7, ground floor." We'll take it. There it is. Nice, huh? Fresh air and all. Are you crazy! - How much do you think it cost? - It's probably beastly expensive. It should probably cost DKK 100 - 125 per month. No, they can't demand that for this! There is the kitchen. Gentlemen... Is there anything I can help with? Nah... we are out to throw a peak at the apartment. We could possibly consider renting it. - How much are you entitled to? - Entitled to? When we pay the rent, I guess we have the right to live here. I mean, how many people are you? We have a couple of children... or will have. We have a couple of Boern. - How much does it cost? - DKK 2000 - Divide by 12. - How much per month? DKK 2000 per month. It will be 24,000 per year. - There is a down deposit of 30,000. - 30,000... Is that all? And then no dog may be kept here. Please repeat that once more. - Dogs must not be kept. - Why not? One can't have that. Then they go and piggy it up everywhere. If men were half as clean as Hannibal,â€” - so much was won! - Of course there are exceptions. - Yes, you're damn right! Now if we in a fit of confusion, - - should rent this crap apartment, what will we do about Hannibal? - Throw him out the window? Or kill him! - I didn't know that... Perhaps the children can't be here either. Should they be euthanized? It'll depend, how many there are. We have to account for that. No, you don't have to take a stand. We have done that. Come on, Bernhard. Good morning, Valde! Do you work on the day of rest? You can't because the collective agreements. I don't have any agreements. - Did you catch anything? - Yes, there is cod for everyone. Just take it. Thanks. - What the hell, is that you? - Yes, hey. Do you want a beer? You seem like you could use it. - Isn't life awesome? - Nah, I don't know... - What's wrong? - You said something about a house. - You wouldn't want it. - We want that now. - If you have to keep a dog! - You must keep what you want, elephants to white mice. - Children too? - Children too, yes. - Have you had the baby? - Yes, two. They will come with the America boat in 4 days. Yes, but let's look at it. Peter got an apartment. I don't understand that anyone would move away from here. - Shall we look at the house? - Yes, let's do it. - Valde, can we take one for Granny? - Yes, of course. Yes, here it is. Nice house, huh? We can go in here. Hannibal, you stay here. Yes, that's what it looks like here. 2 rooms and the kitchen. - Yes, this needs to be fixed up a bit. - What does it cost? 50 out and 20 a month. And 75 a year for rent to the commune. - 50 out? - Can you live here? No. Yes, in the summer. We won't take it that seriously here at the nock. Well, do you want it? - It'll take time to get the 50. - Like I say money isn't all, you'll figure something out. - What about furniture? - You'll get them on the thrash site. They throw out one piece of furniture after another. It is not worth keeping them. I call that national economics, huh?! (cheerful talk) Dear Nock residents. When we are gathered here tonight, - - is it because that's what we always do on Sunday evenings. Secondly, I want to present you with a small problem. We have to help each other when it is tight. It concerns my two friends, Bernhard and Poul Otto. They could imagine taking over Peter's house. But it's a bit difficult with the starting capital. It is not an unknown problem out here. I thought we could spend a little money together. All according to ability, of course. Look, Peter has to get 50 out. So if we drop one daler per nose. It's a lot of money, but they're nice guys. It doesn't matter who moves in. - We have maintained a certain standard. - Yes. Since we are in agreement, I will go ahead with a 5. Too bad, I do too. - What... have you become a millionaire? - Yes, because I live off my appearance. - (laughter) - That was good, Lydia. Aah no... unfortunately I can't pay more than 1 crown. After all, there are 4 days until the national pension. Yes, the worst time of the month is between the 1st and the last. - You have some wall paper. - You can borrow my lawnmower. And my sewing machine. Before you all get too giving, we have enough. 87 ears too much. We put them in the reserve fund. I feel the urge on behalf of myself and Bernhard - - to say thanks for the generous way we were received. We must try to live up to the trust you have shown us. And... Then there is probably nothing more to say about that thing. Thanks. (clap) (the hum and the flutter) Why do you call the house "The Home?" - It means "Home." - For the sake of my children. - Don't they speak Danish? - I really hope so. - When are they coming? - Tomorrow. We're done inside. - Yes, don't you want to come in and have a look? - Yeah. Aah, that was good. Howdy! Children's room, children's wallpaper. - Isn't it nice here? - Furniture is here! I just saw a truck full of furniture. Better get going, before they go up in smoke. Grab Charles, Sofus and Valde. Say they must take the cart with them. Hello. - Hey, wait a little... - Oh, there they are again. No, it can't help. We are busy. Time is money. It's a bloody shame, when we can use it. You can always use something. How can you be in your sheds with all this? Who pays me for the time you spend unloading? Bernhard... just look at him there. Do you see what I mean? - Yes. - It's sad, huh? - Yes, he's just the type. - What the hell is wrong? Don't tell him that. - Do you ever go to the doctor? - Me?! God, I don't go. Why? Do I look bad? No... not like that. We all have to get out of here. What the hell are you talking about? I'm sorry to say it, but you don't get old. - Don't you think so? - You don't get old. - Not with that speed you got on. - Yes, now you say it, I often felt bad. - Yes, you can see for yourself. - Bernhard, come right here. Now you sit here in the shade. You get this beer. And that bit of load... we'll fix that. We're just borrowing the car. It's faster. (hooray) (music on the dock) - Are you excited, children? - Yes! - Do you think you know your father? - Ork yes. - Not me. - I can. I was old when we left. - How old were you? - 2 years. - Can you recognize them again? - Yes, of course, I have the pictures. - How do i look? - The jacket is fine. Too bad you couldn't fit his pants. Here, good thing I hadn't forgotten them. - Aren't they bigger? - It could well be, it's been a few years. - The flag, the flag! - Relax. Better roll that one out. - Is that all right? - Must be turned. - What are you whining about? - That melody... "Lovely is the earth." - There he is! - Where? I know him from the poster. We'd better get down to him. Goodbye and thanks for the trip. Thank you very much. - Can't you see them? - No. - You still can't see them? - Nah. Yes, there are 2 children coming... Show us the sign, otherwise they won't be able to find us! Yes, yes, children, welcome! Welcome home. Take it down. They have arrived. - Who is he there? - It's dad. Bernhard Iversen. - These are your children. - Good day, welcome. - Where are your suitcases? - Up at the ship. Don't stand and stare! Get the luggage. Yes, yes... yes, yes. - Then we go over to the wagon. - Yes, go ahead. - Why do you think I have a car? - Everyone in America has that. We've gone a bit far from here. It is unhealthy if you have to keep the slim line. Here is the vehicle. Here you go and sit up. - That one?! - We use it on a daily basis. - Don't you like it? - Yes, charming. - It's like in China. - Yes... yes, it is. We have all our luggage with us. We have to stay here. - Come on, Bernhard. - Yes. Yes. Come on. Come on, Bernhard. - There should not be an 'e' at the end. - Yes, it says here. - It looks stupid. - Stick to what you can. I have had many American clients. Yes, don't doubt that, but I guess you don't correspond with them. Nah, no... Now I have covered the table with my finest tablecloth. - I'm running home after the food. - It is nice of you. It was nothing. I'm looking forward to seeing the two little ones. - I have grandchildren myself. - Yes, you have. - Does she have the grandchildren? - Neither children nor grandchildren. - But she is cozying up at the thought. - Well, well. - Is it too early to get the ice cream? - No, they may be here soon. Lillian, don't you have any red sodas? No, but I have some cokes. Arrow home and pick up some pieces. - This is where we live. - It's well done. - It's swinging. - What does it mean? It means: Fancy, dandy, great. Oh. We'd better go inside. I'll just go over and hand over the bikes... Here you go, boy. - It's cozy, daddy. - What do you say? - She says it's nice here. - Do you think so? The dinner table is set. It was nice. What's for dinner? I'm hungry. It should be a surprise. Now you must see... in here you must live. There are two beds. This one is Peter's. This one is Anne's. There isn't that much room. I hope you'll handle it. Daddy's cubs... I'm just looking after the food. - Peter, what should I put on? - Don't know. I'll take the checkered one. Food... get some food. They need to eat! Just borrow it. Just get it. Daddy, do you think you could... What's it called? - Zip me up my back. - Zip me up my back? Yes, I can try it. - Did you live here with mother? - No, no, I didn't. - You look like her. - Do you think? Yes. - And I look like you Aunt Ellen says. - Not as I look today. We don't think you should look any different, do you? Well, he is a darling. - Cheers, Granny. - Cheers, I don't have time. Daddy, you're glad we came, aren't you? Of course. Very happy. No, are you here already? I, who had to have everything ready for you to come. But guess what, I had forgotten to light up under the potatoes. You are not 17 years old anymore. What a lovely pair of children they are. My name is Granny. You must visit me often. Then you can play with my grandkids. Now you just have to see... We'll forget about it. Just take, there is plenty. Ah, where it smells, oh, where this smells. Shouldn't we raise our glasses and welcome us all home. - Where are you going? - Get a couple of Cokes. Well, there they are. - I hope... - Here is currant gel. Well, does it taste good? Goodness, the mustard. Good day, and welcome. Here's the ice cream... You don't have to wait too long to eat it. There is meringue in the bag. But as I said before, I hope... Now nothing should be missing. Well, does it fit your fancy? I won't interrupt then... - And I hope... - Tell me if you're missing something. - Yes, yes, Granny. I hope... - What the hell is it you hope? I forgot all along... Good morning, granny. Nice weather today, huh? - How are you feeling? - Better than I deserved. Want some freshly baked buns? - Have you baked? - Yes, it's for the children. Take care that your good heart does not run away with you too much. - What is it? Corn-flakes... - It's something they eat in America in the morning. That's what they said in the dairy shop. And they should have what they like. What is it? Well, that was good, daddy's dog. Hey, where did you get that from? - Good morning. - Good morning. - How handsome he was. - Yes, he was one of the better ones. He reminded me so much of my son. - He sails too. - Well, well. It is excellent that you take care of the young people. Do you think? Yes, one can get a little fed up by it. Then it is doubly admirable. Trust me, you won't regret it. The only thing that matters is - - is to be allowed to be something for others. I once thought about going that way... once. - Thanks for food. - Bon appetite. Then you'd better get going. The clock is many. What do we do while you are at work? - Work? - Who would look after you? I have to go out and look for a job. A job? I always take a job during the holidays. It's nice to be able to fend for yourself. Funny how that boy looks like you. I can look after the house. I just put it in the freezer. You can run that way. It is a small house with wooden beams. - Do you need a caddy? - A what? Someone who sleeps on golf balls. I guess nobody plays golf out here. Drop it. I'll think of something, See you later. Well, we should... we better... I guess we'd better do that. - Peter... Peter! - What's the matter? - I cannot find the water, how do you flush? - Coming. - Look, there's no water. - Of course there's water. What the hell shall we do? We gotta get some money. Aren't we one the way to go to some farms? - It doesn't help. We have expences. - We can sing something faster! I'm sorry to say it. No other way. You have to get a job. Tell me, it's not to be indiscreet... - But what are you going to do? - I have to take care of my children! Aha...! Oh, you need to look after your kids! At home housemom. Cozy off. While I work myself to death. Yes, that's a good idea. You may think it's a lie! I have Hannibal! I will not worry about your children. You may think it's a lie! If it was me, who were going to be a stay at home house mom! - Come on! - The base, Madsen. Hello, Grandma. Nah, are you coming to visit me? - You invited me, after all. - Yes, I did. What do you sew? Is it for your grandkids? - Do they live with you? - Mostly yes. - Do they live here now? - Yes, but they are sleeping. They are in there. Shall I make you a little cup of cocoa? My grandkids like that a lot too. Can't you take the cups in that cupboard over there? - How many do you have? - Two. A boy and a girl. - What are they called? - What do you say? - What are they called? - Henrik and Else. When they wake up, will they play with me? Of course, they will. Can you check if they are about to wake up? - You know, they aren't there. - Sure they are. You must have made a mistake. Now the cocoa is ready. Do you want to pick them up? - No, you better yourself. - Oh, well sit down while. Can you see coming up. You have slept long enough. I have a surprise for you. - Look, isn't she sweet? - Oh, it's just something you play. - What do you mean? - I play too, I have my mother. Nah, do you do it? That was funny. Can you now sit nicely in here. - Do you want to pour for us? - Yes. Here you go, Henrik. And here you go, Else. Now take care that it is not too hot. Shouldn't we play that Peter and I are your grandchildren? Yeah, I would do that. Think, you have 4 then. - And then you also got a bestie. - Can you tell stories? Aah, nothing special. - I know a little mosquito. - About a mosquito? - Do you want to hear it? - Yes. Once upon a time there was a mosquito. A tiny mosquito. It sat and cried and said: Why am I that gross that all men beat me where I stand and walk How do I become happy again? Then its mom told it: Put some sunshine on your bottle, keep it in your bag Hear, how funny it is then take the scent of the wild rose put it in a colored paper bag a trill from a lark we must have that too Now you must have noticed what it was I said? take some sunshine put it in a bottle Hey, how funny it is, feel, how happy you will be. Do you need a healthy man for something? Maybe. What can you? Car wash, cleaning, lawnmowing, town arrangements. - Private chauffeurs, babysitting. - Babysitting. That is something. - Do you have many children? - No. - But have you been to Lydia's? - Where does she live? - In the house with the horse. - Thank you. Hello, do you need a healthy man? I heard you were going to need a babysitter. Don't come here and be naughty! Can you come out! Well, well. It could be that you needed a babysitter. It was only because I met Tusnelda she and I, we fell in love with each other I was overwhelmed by her beauty but she liked nice expensive clothes I was disgusted by her consumption of clothes Give a drought my destiny became so hard it's only because I met Tusnelda that we now go around from farm to farm you will also meet your Tusnelda old friend, but I wonder if she'll be like mine you have to take the risk yourself love-joy often becomes a man's ruin my experience you get a little help from look at my partner, he did it, like me it was he, who took over Tusnelda brother, take care it will not happen to you. (clap) What a bunch of radishes, huh? Hannibal, come to father. I must also have enrolled the children in a school. - It's such a shame. - Of course they have to go to school. Should they run around like illiterates the rest of their lives? - A lot of nice words you use lately. Shall we have a drink then? - No. We don't have time nor can afford. We still need to reach 5-6 farms. - How boring you have become. - You had better help me. When Hannibal and I in our goodness run and wear ourselves out, - - you can be cozy. Shall we get that beer! All right. Then we share one. Shares?! It is a shame to say that you have become likeable as a father! Capitalist. Bloodsucker. Taxpayer. Hannibal, can you stand here and wait a little for daddy? Tomorrow we're off. We're going to go demonstrate. Yes, it must be here. - Good day. - We wabt to talk to the director. We have some children we want to register. - Moment. - Thanks. - Do you like it? - Yes, it's nice here. - Here you go. - Thanks. Good day. Inspector Joergensen. - Madsen. - Iversen. - It's Peter and Anne. - You can take a seat over there. - Go ahead and sit down. - Thanks. - It's about the children, isn't it? - Yes. We're asking if they can go to school here? - Yes, they belong here, don't they? - Yeah. That's what Valde said. Oh... How old are the children? - How old is it you are? - Turning 9 years the 8th of July this year. - Then you go to school. - Went in America. Yes, we have had them in America. - Oh... How old are you then? - 6 years old. I am born the 12th of January. - Yes, it was winter. It snowed. - Well... like that. They speak English fluently. Yes... but we'd better write something up. Will it cost anything, we're prepared for that. It doesn't work. You have paid for that through your tax. - Have we? - Yes. May I ask for your name? - What are you going to do with it? - I must have the parents' names. - Poul Otto Madsen. - Poul... Otto... Madsen. - Henry Bernhard Iversen. - Whose are the children? Ours. We share them. We are a kind of extended family. - Are the children siblings? - Yes, they have no mother. Well, like that... Who is the biological father? - That guy is my father. - Also mine. - And your name was therefore... - Henry Bernhard Iversen. - Position? - We are in the entertainment business. - Showbiz. Can you use it? - Yes, that is completely fine. - And the address? - Main Street 15, the Nock. - Which one? - The Nock. It's over here by the thrash site. Come and get a beer. Yes, thanks, thanks. Then it should be in order. The children meet at the school on August 12th at 9 o'clock. Peter starts in 3rd grade, and Anne in 1st grade and they'll get the books here. - And then goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, children. Ms. Andersen, please call Children's Welfare for me. - Long live Peter! - Hooray, hooray, hooray. (honks) What favorable wind has brought you hither, you Queen of the Pit Fall? You talked a lot about those kids, so now I want to see them. When you don't have that much courtesy for you to invite me yourself, I have to come by myself. - She is very hot for me. - (laughter) Dad, what does it mean to have the hots on someone? Aah, that's just nonsense. You must be Anne. My name is Olga. And it's the birthday child. Here you go. Congratulations. - Here is something for Hannibal. - Oh, the dinner is saved then! How did you manage to get such pretty kids? It is probably because they have fallen out after me. ... the more we are together are together are together... - Is it here? - I guess it is. Main Street 15, Iversen. - Please wait here. - Yes. - (laughter) - Cheers! Nah, more congratulations are coming! What can we do for you? They need a beer. Come in. Come and pretend you are at home. Is Mr. Bernhard Iversen present? Present? He is sitting there. Stand up, Bernhard. - We would like to talk to you. - What have you done now?! Isn't there somewhere we can talk undesturbed? Yes, of course. Don't smack with the door. The house will collapse. (laughter) - They looked a little triangled. - Maybe we won the lottery. - Are you playing? - Nah. It's messy a little bit, but we have a party today. - (the bottles roll over) - It was me... Here you go. It's supervisor Mrs. Berg, I'm agent Mortensen. We come from Children's Welfare. We want to talk to you about your children. - Yes... go ahead and sit down. - Thanks. Now I have to... - They have two children. - Was it those two out there? - They have parental authority? - Yes, I am their father. Therefore, you do not need to have parental authority. - Well. They don't have any mom. - We know that. - So you live here permanently? - Yes. - How are the sanitary conditions? - What? Is there a toilet and running water here? Well... not like that. But we'll make it. - Do you have any work? - Yes. Yes. - Which one? - We... my mate and I... - We are in the entertainment business. - Where? Around the farms. We sing and play... Mr. Iversen, could we meet your commarate? Yes, of course. ... Poul Otto, come on! Now he comes. It's from the Children's Service. They want to say hello to you. Ha-ha, do you I look that young? - Joking aside. What is it about? - They don't like us living here. - There isn't pull and let go. - Have they said where we should live? - It's not that, Mr... - Madsen. Poul Otto. So what is it about? I understand that you leave home to attend to your... work. That's what we need! How else would we live. Now you must have that beer. - Sir. Iversen, how much do you make? - Yes, what do we earn... When we really do something about it, it will be DKK 20 a day. - 120 cr. a week. Incredible! - And then they're tax free. 4 people can't exist for that! Yes. Sometimes we get a packed lunch at Olga's. - She who has the Pitfall. - It's dog food. But it tastes very good. Plenty for us all. Do you have it, Deputy Mortensen? Who looks after the children while you are away? Yes, we have it absolutely ideal out here! The one day they're at Granny. Then at Valde, then Lydia... Lydia is our local naughty girl. She is nice to the children. These kinds of girls are often worth more than... I won't mention any names. Heart in the right place and everything... Lovely girl. Shouldn't the children grow up as healthy, happy citizens? - Yes, thank you very much. - Now we are in the higher matter. And I thought not that little about this. I often say: Poul Otto, when the hell are you happy? It's not money, that brings someone happiness. I once read: "With money you can buy everything and yet nothing." Can you see the idea? Do you understand what I mean? You can buy food, but not appetite. Medicine, but not good health. Learning, but not wisdom. Nice houses, but not coziness. Comrades, not friends. Tranquility, but not peace. Do you see what I mean? It sounds very nice. When you have to be honest, isn't it disallowed- - to bring up the children under these conditions? Maybe, but we can't get it better at the moment. That's where we come into the picture. When a father is alone to provide for his children, - - does he need guidance and support... A moment! He's not alone, is he? There's me too. Can you wash and iron? Cooking, running a household? I don't know, but I bought a cookbook. Not written for normal people. But what does it mean to blanch? Yes, to pour boiling water over. - Why don't you write it then? - Shouldn't we stick to the case? Attorney Mortensen, will you? Based on that information I can see, - - that the matter falls under Â§28. And what does it say in Â§28? "Without the consent of the holder of the parental authority - - can a decision be made about placement outside the home, - - when placement is required for the sake of the child's well-being." I have to have that one more time. Are you thinking of taking my children away from me? It sounds so severe. We are only thinking about putting your kids at an institution. Until you get your relationship right. Now a whole Christmas tree is going up for me! - Are the children going to an orphanage? - What if I refuse? You won't. That would be unwise of you. Especially for the sake of your children. May I insert a remark? What the hell is the point?! They insist that we mistreat and under-nourish our children! A toilet without drag-and-drop! What does that have to do with happiness? - There are many cases... - It is possible! Isn't it written somewhere that maybe the children are happy the way they are? - Be silent. They do it in the best intend. - That's right, Mr. Iversen. I need to put my business in order... what do you mean by that? First, you must find a suitable home. And then we must probably demand for a woman to take care of the children. Because I guess we agree... what is a home without a mother? I've been married! She was cock-drunk from morning to night. - It must be one of the exceptions. - I will not be a white bride! Now we process the case, and you will hear from us soonest. - Goodbye, Mr. Iversen. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Fuck that, Bernhard. Fuck it, Bernhard! Dad, what's a Children's Welfare? It's nice people, who watch that no one is mean to children. Why do they come running out here? It's probably for just in case. Come on. Now we'll build a new nice house, then it will be fine. We can also say that we don't want to be anywhere else but with you. It's a free country we live in. Yes... in a way. Are you well now? Good night. - Good night, my boy. - Good night. - Sleep well. - Thanks. What about the lady they want to look after us? Dad can just get married. Ladies are crazy about getting married. Only with millionaires. And I don't think dad is particularly rich. We place an ad in: Handsome father seeks mother with a lot of money. It is not certain that she likes us. Then we can write: Two lovely children are looking for a mother with a lot of money. Father has... The ad just needs to be set up correctly. - So it sells! - Well... Yes, it is excellent. But what about the cover? It's the cover that sells. - What about nude girls? - Original! There is one on each side! "Police attack peaceful demonstrators." - They didn't do that! - No, but it looks like that. There we have Jensen, our youngest but most brilliant employee. - I'm a little late... - We've only been waiting for half an hour! I was afraid it was more. I'm sure you'll come up with the all-time cover. Yes, I'm talking about the front page of the magazine, which will be printed in 1 hour. - Well, that one. - Yes, you are a gifted person. - Well, that may be so. - Then you got an amazing suggestion. - To what? - To the front page. - Animals and kids are always good. - Isn't that unique! Jensen has a great future ahead of him! As a journalist. Jensen... But only if you meet with history of all time within 1 hour. Or you're fired! Understanding? With pictures? If it isn't too much of an inconvenience. Get going! Animals, animals, animals, animals, animals. Children! Hello? They talk to Jensen. Do I meet Miss Olsen? Hey, honey... It's Buller. The bully boy. Hello. How are you feeling? I'm in trouble. I need a malnourished child in a flash. I know you aren't allowed to tell anyone. I won't tell where I got it from, will I, honey? Let it be! You must have just a little malnourished child. What do you say? The Nock? Great, great. What is the name? Iversen? Nice, thanks. You haven't heard anything from that Children's Welfare, have you? - Not a sound. - They must have fallen for our charm. They can just come. Look here, look here, what we found. Oh, it's pretty. God no, the press is in on it. My name is editor Jensen. Shall we take a few pictures? Is it Mr. Iversen? Is that your son, Mr. Iversen? - Have other people photographed you? - No, you are the first. Always am. Shall we get started? They have a hammer. Do we have a beer? Children, you stand in front. Now you look really deadly. You guys are cowering, won't you? It should be funny. We're going out of the picture. Fine... One more. Great. What shall we think of? I got it. I throw myself before you. They pretend to kick me, - - because I disturb you at work. - Great, thank you very much. - Just a moment! What the hell are you up to?! Don't play innocent. I can imagine the front page. "Brutal father beat kids with hammer." "Assaults innocent journalist." Now I have to get you a picture. Ugh, what?! Are you ready? ...Come on! Do we need more, Deputy Mortensen? Well, there you are. Where have you been for so long? What do you guys look like? The Children's Welfare picked up the kids the day before yesterday. We haven't been sober since. Well, they've picked them up. I feel sorry for you. Let's go and talk in private. You also need a beer. Olsen, if there is anything, I'll be upstairs. - How nice you live, Olga. - Yes, it is very nice here. And then it's on top of the business. Come. Come and sit down. Well, they have picked up the children. What will you do about it? - Nothing. Nothing can be done. - You can always do something. - What, for example? - Roll up your sleeves. Get started. Nah, we've given up on it all. Yes, it's a fine way to solve the problems at. You are a pair of worse slackers. Are we?! Haven't we done everything to make it good? - Yes, but apparently not good enough. - I'll probably have to send them back. That would be a shame. Or are you tired of them? No, how can I do without them! See! They are also some lovely children. Those Children's Welfare people are certainly both nice and well intended. I understand that they aren't too excited about you all living at the Nock. Yes, we could probably find another place to stay. Yes, and I have a job for you here. - A job...?! - I need someone to do the dishes. - Wash up?! - Yes, and it must be proper. You will get 10 cr. an hour plus board and a weekly day off. DKK 10? What are we going to use all that money for? It's expensive to have kids. Well, shall we? You can think about it a bit. I have to go down and work. Think, it had to end like this! That I, Poul Otto Madsen, must belong to the working classes. No, it's no use! What about that woman? The one who said we had to acquire! "What is a home without a mother?" Where is the personal freedom in this country? They pry into people's affairs. Would you marry a foreign shoemaker? Which must also be visible in all corners and edges! - So you can keep your children! - Yes. Stupid thought! - Did you say yes? - I am capable of anything. - Just to keep them. - That's something else. What about me? Yes, I can be a housemate. What was it... The children suggested we put an ad in the paper. Our social circle is not what it used to be. Good idea...! Damn good idea! Hannibal, get Dad a newspaper. That was good, daddy's dog. Well, let's see, Bernhard. Listen to this. "My body is for sale. DKK 11. The kiosk, Nansensgade." Stop with that. It will be under "Personal." - It was otherwise cheap, huh? - It's probably a porn book. You can also get bottomless lace panties. Then you have to go all the way to Istedgade. I can just see you! It's not funny. Come on then. "Personal." Oh, how many there are. Summer wish. 30 years old. Slender. Dark mansion in Gentofte. Interests: Travels in the Mediterranean countries and children. Seeking acquaintance with young lady possibly marriage... It's just you. It should preferably be a lady, right? It is that! Oh no, it isn't. "Life has not given me a husband and a child." Looking for an acquaintance now. Marriage to a widower. Has own mansion. Am 68 years old... We find something that is younger. Here she is, the drop dead gorgous. It says there. The drop dead gorgeous. Slim girl, approx. 28 years old, red hair, mansion and car and poodle dog. Looking for a tall handsome man, preferably from Amager... This is just you! Stop by Olga's and get some paper... Orv, there are many more. We're drowning in them. Nurse seeks marriage. And single mother... She is affectionate. Teacher in her early twenties with mansion, car and telephone... You, we put them here in the Pit Fall. Good with a nice adress. - Do you want more to eat? - No thanks. - Do you want more? - No thanks. - You don't eat anything. - We are not hungry. - We are in a bad mood. - Aren't we nice to you? Yes, but we have come to live with our father. I understand that. By the way, he'll come pick you up in a little while. Only for this afternoon. You are going to the Zoo. - Are we going to the Zoo? - No, we'll do that another time. We have a problem that you need to decide on... - Shut up, Olga. - Hi. - Has something happened? - Yes, why not! There are 10-12 women who have been put on appointment here. - So many! - Yes, all the letters I have written! May I have an explanation? We have invested in matrimonial ads and placed them here. Matrimonial ads?! Keep your sex life to yourself! The Children's Welfare has demanded that there must be a female for the children. It's cheaper to get married than a maid. - You don't mess with the children. - Yes, we have to help choose. Completely sane you're not! You must at least finish before 5 o'clock. That is clear. You put yourself in the corner. I go up and send them down one at a time. Then we stand here in the limb and look at them. - Olga, how do I look? - Brilliant. I'll just take the the folder of papers. Sorry. Good day, ladies. Welcome. - I came first! - Yes, yes, don't push. Please line up in the order you arrived. Do you have the little letter I wrote with you? I'll get that for the record. Dad, here comes the first one. That's my friend there, Bernhard Iversen. And that's Mrs... - Alma Madsen. - My name is also... Madsen. Then we save the costs for the door sign. It's not me, it's my friend who... - Is it him? - Yes, a nice guy. Now sit down and talk to Bernhard. Then I sit down here. Well... You are not married... I understand. No, not anymore! Do you like children? - Yes, I can. - Do you have a house? - If I have a house? - Yes. - Yes... well, like that. - Fine. When one gets into a marriage, - - you should live under good economic conditions. Am I right? - Especially with 6 dependent children. - I only have two. Do you have two? ... Then there will be 8 in total. - Do you have 6? - Yes, I certainly have. Do you want to see them? ... The children? - Do you have them with you? - Yes, here in the bag. It is the oldest, Soeren. He must be a doctor. Christian must be Engineer. Katrine...she's adorable, isn't she? She looks like me. Helmut we'll get problems with. He doesn't know what he wants to be. Then there are the two young ones, the twins. A pair of wild ones... Will you also see them? Yes, it is unique. Now you just have to listen... Yes, shouldn't we set the date? - The date? - For the wedding. Shouldn't you give it some thought? No, I am a very big connoisseur of people. Oh... oh, so have you noticed it? - To what? - It is my duty to say so. God, you can't tell that from looking at him. No, but it is my duty to tell you. Yes, it is too. Thanks, that was nice of you. - Good recovery. - Thanks. - By the way, are you married? - Yes, yes, uh, yes. Well, it was boring. - What the hell did you say to her? - It does not matter. Well, on to next, number 2. It's the drop dead gorgeous. Olga, now someone else is coming. Number 2. Now look a little cheerful or I won't get you engaged. Yes like that. Hold it. Where do you want me? Well, wasn't that something either? No, one is uglier than the other. It's not always the looks, it depends on. It's nice to have something nice to look at. - Remember how good looking our father is. - Yes. What if dad can't find one? - So is he sending us back? - Do you want it? Yes, you can't send people around like that. No, you can not. - Just see how it goes. - Yes. Now a new one is coming. Come and see. - Christ! - What is it? - She wants to be a white bride. - That is also adorable. - Serving! - Olga, a customer came. - Shall we have another soda? - Yes. - No, how weak-minded we are! - Why? - We have Olga, after all. - To what? We can't get anyone better than Olga. She has both an apartment, money and a car. And a good business. - Do you think she loves him? - She probably does. - What are you looking at? - At you. I don't think so... that she loves him. She can get to that. She likes us. She is also beautiful. - Should we tell him? - No, he gets shy. Let me fix it. First we need music. Ladies love music. They always get so touched. - (music) - Are you moved by it? Nah. What about that one? I don't get a lot of emotion, but a little. - What do you want to say to her? - There she comes. - They are at number 6. - Haven't they chosen anyone? No. You, Olga... Do you know, what I suddenly thought about? It's strange, you're not married. You, who is so beautiful. Yes, I suddenly thought of that too. - Yes, how can that be? - I don't know. - Nobody wants me. - Just leave it alone! - Do you like music? - I like music a lot. (he turns up the music) Olga, what should the man you marry look like? Light or dark? - He must be dark. - Do you think so? There is something about dark men. I want one dark as... - Wouldn't it be nice with children? - Yes, it would. Maybe you're too old to get any yourself. - I'm not that old. - Well, you can have a lot of kids. You just don't know how they will turn out. - Well... - What are you up to? We just think it's a shame you go to waste. We'd better tell her straight up. - Sit down, Olga, and have a cigarette. - And a small glass of sherry. Now you have to listen, Olga... Put your strong arm around me and protect me from the evils of life, - - as if I were a little yellow Easter chicken in your hands. Let me be the woman you've always dreamed of. Mrs. Hopballe, it's very nice of you, but it's all so sudden. Great love always does that... Big stupid boy. Shouldn't we give the big dumb boy a break, shall we? We'll probably send for you. - Until then, live well. - Live well yourself. You can't say anything other than that you are lucky. - Have they gone? - Yes. - You haven't chosen anyone, have you? - No. - Oh, luckily. - I don't know. - Get your old father a beer. - No, you have to go out to see Olga. - She wants to talk to you. - Does she want to talk to me? - Is she mad? - No, she is in top shape. She is very touched. There is one more. Bernard! The next! Is that you, Lydia? - Is it you? - Yes... - What do you want? - It's about the ad. - The one you wrote to me... - Have I? Do I have? Lydia... And finally, I would like to say: Shouldn't we bring out a ninefold live for the bride and groom? - Are you ready? - Get up, Bernhard. - They live! - Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray. Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray. - And then the long haul! - Hooray. And then there is dinner for everyone in the Pit Fall. Take a little sunshine, pick a piece of the sky Take a little sunshine, pick a piece of the sky hand it out in the crowd give what you can give bring some sunshine to your friends make everyone you know pour your heart into it the whole world walks and sighs but now hears what we say to each party pooper there is an advice we give take a little sunshine pick a piece of the sky hand it out to the crowd, how happy you will be the whole world walks and sighs but now hears what we say to each party pooper there is an advice we give. take a little sunshine pick a piece of the sky hand it out to the crowd, how happy you will be. ---Subtitles by Essery---
