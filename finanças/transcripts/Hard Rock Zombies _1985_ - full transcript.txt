Others are preserved. It depends on the music that--" - Oh, who cares about that! - Oh, now I see. "They feed on living flesh..." - We noticed that! - Yeah... Yeah, they... "They rip off your skin, while the blood is still flowing in your veins." - Well we noticed that too... - I got it. Here it is... "Certain ghouls don't eat heads." - So? - Well, uh... Ghouls hate heads, the way Satan hates the Church. You see, ghouls are the antithesis of intellectual existence, ...which centers within the heads. In the ghoul, the brain dissolves to become their venom-- - So...? What can we do? - Yeah, what do we do? - We use our heads! ♪ When you make your day... ♪ ♪ NA! NA! ♪ ♪ NA! NA! NAA! ♪ - Yeah, Zelda?

If we wear these, they don't attack us. - So? - So our brave young men can get close enough to kill them? - Aren't killing wools ghouls already dead? - It's our only hope. - A waste of good wool. - Well, we don't actually kill them.

They oomph her! Then... They devour her. Then, they go back to their graves for 100 years. So, then it's somebody else's problem. No... That's an old wives tale. - No... It happened once in Los Angeles. The ghouls returned to their graves, after ravishing a virgin in the moonlight, at midnight. It's the only way they have sex! - Where did they find a virgin in Los Angeles? - It was 1890... So they stay in their graves, until 1990! Unless an earthquake makes it happen sooner... - God.

I mean... They, uh... Forget it. All my life, I wanted to be like you, sir. Ever since I was a kid, I... You were my idol. I learned to hustle from you, I... I learned to... to deal by reading about you. Everything I learned from the business I learned about... from you. But you know what I learned tonight? I learned that none of it means a damn! Oh... No offense, sir. I mean, don't bite my head off, but... The money... The... the deals. The glitter... It's nothing. It's trivial. The real thing... The only thing... is to survive. You know what I'm doing right now? I'm using everything I learned from you, just to help one little girl. Not to make a record or... or a million bucks. But just so one little girl could end this day as alive as she started. And that's all. I finally understand that life is the only thing of value. Nothing else. You ever feel that way, sir? You suck, mister! I know it and everybody knows it! - Leave me alone! Please, don't! Let me go! Please, let me go! Help me! Please! - You guys, I need you. I need you! Jessie, listen to me.

Make Jessie listen to me! I can't just pull it all together this time. I can't do it alone, while you guys just fart around and lay down and die! - Please, help! What are you doing? Don't leave me alone. - Jessie. I've got the ring you have to Cassie. They've got her, Jess. They're gonna tie her to... tie her up and... and then let all the ghouls screw her to death. Is that what you want? Ghouls, you created, screwing her to death? Yes. Come on. Yes! Come on! Good! One more show! Come on. - Argh. Urgh? - Argh! Sieg! Heil! Sieg!
