(Multicom Jingle) (eerie music) (crickets chirping) (bus booming) (bell ringing) - Now don't forget tomorrow we're gonna do chapter two, be sure to have read the entire chapter. Whatever. See you tomorrow. - Bye, see you tomorrow. - Bye. - [Student] Bye everyone. - [Child] Bye, Cody! - Bye. - Bye. - Thanks. - That was some snowball fight at recess. - Hey Cody, hey Scooter. - [Children] Hey Dad. - Hey Cody, shut the corral gate so Cornelius doesn't get out, will ya. - Who the heck left it open in the first place. (dramatic music) (bull snorting) (gate squeaking) (bull snorting) I was gonna do it, I was just waitin'. - Waitin' for what Cody? Waitin' until he got out and wreak havoc with the herd. - No sir, waiting for him to move. - You invited him to move with your indecision. Go on, get in the house. C'mon Scooter, I'll take you for a ride in the sleigh. (laughing) - [Emma] Hi Cody. - Hi. - Why the glum face? - Nothing. - What did Daddy say to you? - Nothing. - [Scooter] Giddy up horsey, whee. (laughing) - Hey Dorsie, what ya doin'? What's the suitcase for? - It's the end of the month, David. - The end of the month, who are you, the landlord? (laughs) - No, that's just who's gonna be here in two weeks. Now I said that I would give you until the end of the month to finally get serious about these bills. I'm not gonna be the one who they come after. - Aw, listen to me, baby. - Don't, don't baby me. - Well you are my baby, you can't take care of yourself. And by the way, it is not the last of the month. - [Dorsie] What do you mean? - What I mean is that 30 days hath September, April, June and November, all the rest have 31 except for February. - Oh, great, great. So by tomorrow midnight our financial problems gonna be over, huh? You finally gonna start to discipline that great mind of yours. - (laughing) I'm not gonna try to kid you. Nothing changes overnight. But I swear to you one thing, starting tomorrow, it's the beginning of the big one. - (scoffs) The big one. - Yeah. You remember, the Biggie. - Yeah, tomorrow. - Yeah, it's hell yes tomorrow, where you think I've been for the last two days. Why do you think I wrote that letter, huh? The big letter. Why do you think Freddie and Lyle are flyin' in. - Freddie and Lyle are comin'? - Tomorrow mornin'. You don't believe me, want to call 'em? Go on, go on, call 'em. Come on, huh? Did I ever tell you it was gonna be the Biggie when it wasn't? - No. - No. - Don't. - Did I ever tell you there was somethin' so beautiful about you when your mind is made up. - That isn't gonna work. - No? There's somethin' so strong about you. Next to me you are the strongest person that I know and that's why I need you, Dorsie. You think I ever would have planned the big one if I didn't think you were gonna be a part of it? Hm? (Dorsie sniffling) Dorsie, you and I are like two poles on a battery. Standing alone we're nothin'. Nothin' but a couple of stumps stickin' up in the air. But when we connect. (tongue clicks) We create a power, a force that's bigger than either one of us. You feel the heat that we create, huh? Do you feel that? That's power, baby, that's life. That's us. And I'll tell ya somethin'. If by tomorrow night you don't believe that we're on our way to a better life, you can walk. In fact, I'll give you the keys and you can drive. (laughs) Oh, the plan's in motion baby, and nothing's gonna stop it. And if you leave now, you will always and forever say to yourself, I could have been there too. I need you baby. - David. - I need you baby. I really, really, really need you, baby. - It's the council's job to provide equipment. - Yeah, but you know how the PTA loves to have bake sales and the chocolate drive. - They're not gonna mind if the Council gives us a couple of computers. (Jake laughing) - [Man] Did somebody say something funny? - [Woman] Come on Jake, share the joke. - Oh, I was just wondering if anyone from L.A. Unified heard you worrying about who we're gonna allow to give us $6,000 worth of computers, while they're worrying about how to pay for metal detectors. - That's why you came home, Jake. - Nah, he came back from L.A. because there's no hunting there. - No, I came back because I didn't appreciate being the prey. - Yeah, okay, Melanie, let's go. - Where's Dorsie? - Gone. - Gone where? - Gone to Salt Lake, she's gonna pick up Uncle Freddie and Uncle Lyle in the morning at the airport. - They're not my uncles. - Well, they're my boys. I put out the call, they come running. - Daddy, I thought we were goin' to Yellowstone. - We are. Just gonna mix in a little business. Commerce never sleeps child. - Hey, what's all this? - Just a bunch of junk. - Daddy, is everything okay with you? - I have never been better. - [Kathi] Yeah, no sweat Cal, we'll cover for ya. - [Dev] Kathi! - I'll catch you later, Cal. Over and out. (radio chattering) - What the hell is this? - I told you about it two weeks ago, Sheriff. - I thought I talked some sense into you. - Well, I listened but I just don't see the sense in it. There's more money, more responsibility and here I'm just a glorified secretary. - You're a Sheriff's dispatcher is what you are. That other think is just a big fancy title, is all. What the hell am I supposed to do tomorrow. You can't just leave. - Well, I'm not missin' my first meetin'. You're just gonna have to find someone. Wondering what you were waitin' on. You can get any number of people. Answering calls and getting you a Danish does not take extraordinary skill. - Well let's just turn this thing around a moment, shall we? What makes you think a young lady like yourself is qualified to be an emergency management coordinator anyways. - Because I took the courses, Dev. - Exactly, the question stands. (Kathi sighs) (dog barking faintly) - [Laura] I love you for bringing us here. - Not gonna go stir crazy? - Jake, it's exactly what I want. A place where my children will be able to walk the streets anytime of day or night and feel safe. - Yeah, well there's no mall and there's only one grocery store. - Come on. (dramatic music) - Hey! - Ah! What the! - [Jake] Oh, Cal? - Jake, what the hell. What are you doing? - Look, I'm sorry. Big city reflex. - Oh, that is my fault, I guess I should have recognized the car. Thought you was kids is all. - Doesn't this take the cake. Laura was just telling me how safe she feels here and sure enough, here's the town's only police officer spending his night protecting the young maidens of Cokeville. - Sorry Jake. Laura, you all right? - Fine Cal, except you're about eight months late. (Cal laughs) - I'm sorry. - No, hike. - Goodnight. - Take it easy. - Well, Tracy and Cody are all tucked in. Tom, what did you and Cody have some words about today? - I got nothin'. - Lord. Like father like son. - No, not like father like son. At 12 years old I was not scared to go up to a corral and close the gate on an old bull like my father told me. In fact, I'd have been scared not to for fear of gettin' a lickin', - So this is about courage and C.C. again. - I guess. - Why can't you just let Cody be who he is. - I didn't say a word, I just closed the gate. - Mm-hmm. (dramatic music) - Sh. Sh. - What are you doing? - It's okay, baby. It's okay. - Stop staring at me that way. - Now listen to me, Melanie. There's gonna be a Brave New World starting today. And this is the way you can be a part of it. The only way. - Don't touch me! (tense music) - Melanie? Melanie, you don't understand. This is it, Melanie. In a few hours it's gonna be dawn, the big day, Biggie day, for me and Dorsie and for you too. But we all gotta be one. (door clicking) - What's in there? It's a bomb, isn't it? - (laughs) It's a magic carpet. It'll take us wherever we want to go. - Bombs kill people. - (sighs) Didn't you learn anything? All the things I tried to teach you. Death is only a transitional point on the everlasting wheel of life. A wheel is a circle spinning on a horizontal axis. What goes around comes around. What you give now you get back many times over but you gotta learn to give, baby. - I want to go home. - We'll talk about it tomorrow. - [Melanie] No, now! - Don't talk back to your father. You go on back to bed, I'm not gonna touch you. But God help you if you say anything to Dorsie. (birds chirping) - [Emma] Oh, it's cold. You'll be okay, sweetie. Just wait for the bus. Here she comes. (children chattering) Hi, okay, up you go darlin'. You take care of my babies now. Cody, I'll miss you. - Oh hi Cody, hi Tracey. - Hi. - [Emma] Have a good day at school. (children chattering) - [Student] Morning Mr. Downey. - Hi, Mr. Downey. - Good morning, Mr. Downey. - Mr. Downey, shot any bears lately? - Three yesterday, before breakfast. - [Student] Hi, Mr. Downy! - [Student] Good morning. (dramatic music) - You ever hear of diabetes, Pops? Insulin, yum, yum. You want to watch? (man groaning) - [Cook] Order up. - [Waitress] There you go. - Come on Dorsie, what's up? - All I can tell ya is it's goin' down. - The Biggie? After all these years? I don't believe it. - What do you think he got you here for, huh? - Hit us up for more money, I figured. (laughing) - If you don't believe in him... - Of course I believe in him. - Yeah, well you better believe. All the roads you traveled together. - David is the smartest man that I've ever met. I do believe he's gonna get us all very rich. - So what do you think it is this time? - He's got a bomb. - A bomb? - He's in the bathroom half the night building it. - Wait a second. I ain't getting involved with anything that needs a bomb. - You just listen to me. Didn't you just say it yourself that you believe in him, huh? That he's a genius. - Yeah, well, of course he is. - [Lyle] Why do you think we flew out here. - And whatever it is he's got planned, you know it's gonna work. And you know it's gonna make you very rich. - Are you sure it's a bomb? - Look. (dramatic eerie music) (birds chirping) - This is my bear, her name's Ursula. - That's a very interesting name. Now why did you call her that? - Because my brother says it means bear. - That's absolutely right. Tracy, very good. Thank you for sharing Ursula with us. Mikey, who did you bring. - My bug. (students groaning) - [David] Okay, Lyle, Lyle, I want you to get on the other side of Dorsie, all right. Boy, girl, boy, girl, come on. - Oh, for God's sake. - Hey, this is historic occasion, all right, this is Biggie day, we gotta capture this for posterity. Hang on. Ready, all right. (camera beeping) Okay, smile everybody. (camera clicking) That picture is gonna run in every newspaper from The New York Times on down. Architects of the Brave New World. - Brave new world. - Yep. - David, now don't you think it's about time you told us what this plan is? - Get my letter? - Yeah, we got it. - You read it? - We read it. Zero equals infinity. What's that mean? - (laughs) Tell him, honey. - It means nobody knows anything. So like, there's no reality. - That's my girl. - I'm not as smart as you, David, I know that. So if you could, if you could explain what that means. - (sighs) Well I can see that there's no point in my discussing anything of a spiritual, of a metaphysical, of a higher plane with you two. So maybe you'll understand this. What do you see in the van? - Um, well there's guns and and a whole lot of ammo. - And some kind of bomb. - Uh huh, very good. Now what we're gonna do, we're gonna take these items down the hill and we are gonna do the Biggie. - Which is? - Which is to take over the Cokeville Public Elementary School. Every single teacher, every single kid, every one of 'em. - That's it, that's the Biggie? - David, I don't know-- - Will you shut up! What's the matter with you people? I spent months developing this. Pickin' this town. It has got one cop. It has got a school which has among the best and brightest kids in the world. I have learned that their parents will do anything, anything for them. I have designed and built a foolproof detonating device and you pygmies can't appreciate it. Now you know where this letter is going? This letter that you cannot understand? To the President of the United States. That's right. So that he will know what kind of a mind he is dealing with. And he will know because he is the President of the United States. Now you two don't have the vision to see the path before you which leads where no man has gone before. - No way. Look, I'm sorry David, but I'm out. - Me too. I ain't takin' over no school. - Melanie? (laughs) Well, I can't force anybody. - [Freddie] Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy now. - Okay, Dorsie, there's handcuffs in the van, go get 'em baby. - Don't do it. - You do it baby or I'm gonna shoot her and them, all of 'em. Come on baby, come on. - David. - Come on, this is the Biggie, this is our shot. You and me everything we always wanted. Come on baby, but I can't do it without ya. You just do what I tell ya and nobody's gonna get hurt, all right. Dorsie, Dorsie, they don't understand me they never have. But you and me, we are one baby. The future king and queen of the Brave New World. But I can't do it without ya baby. I really need your help, now come on. Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt if you just do what I tell ya. Nobody's gonna get hurt, I promise. - Okay, okay. - Go on. - Okay fellas, you just stay right there. You too. (birds chirping) - I'm going to lunch. - Oh, don't forget, you've got that interview with that kindergarten teacher at 1:30. - I'll be here. (bell ringing) Oh God. (woman laughs) It's no use, I'll never get used to that thing. Does it have to ring in here? - No, reprogram it. - Reprogram it? That's it? I've been living with this shock treatment for three months. All right. Just concentrate, it shouldn't be that difficult, we're all intelligent adult human beings. (people chattering) Call a sixth grader. - (laughs) Jake Downey can do it, he's the computer whiz around here. - Call Jake Downey. - David, now we all been together a long time. You have got to listen. There is no way you could pull this off. You must know that, you're too smart. - A elementary school, they may pay off, but, and you might get away, but they're never gonna leave you alone. - What makes you think that I'm going someplace where anybody can find me. - There's no place-- - I'm not talking about Brazil. You didn't read my letter did ya. Or any of the stuff that I sent ya. That's why I need the children. They haven't been brainwashed yet. They're pure. I can save them. - Dorsie? Melanie! - Melanie, don't you dare. - We have too! - Just listen to him. - We can't! - You don't understand honey, you do as he says and nothin's gonna happen right. He's not gonna hurt anyone. - Dorsie, what do you think's gonna happen if he goes into that school with a bomb. - You heard him, he's got it all planned. - Dorsie! - Melanie, listen to yourself. You're desertin' him just when he needs you the most. Your own Daddy. I'm gonna tell you something, girl. I tried to leave him, many times. But I can't. All right? So you get to be as old as I am, maybe you're gonna understand. You just gotta believe in somebody. (birds chirping) - I have somethin' to tell you. - There's nothin' more to say. - He's not what you think he is. - I don't want to hear this. - Last night in the motel room-- - I said I don't want to hear it! (car horn honking) - All right it's one o'clock, they're lunch will be over in 15 minutes. Biggie time. (dramatic music) (alarm blaring) (clock ticking) (machines whirring) (engine revving) - You're not armin' it are ya? What if we hit a bump? - Boom! (Freddie yelps) (David laughs) (people chattering) - Dorsie, back it up to the side entrance. (children chattering) Dorsie, come on back here and help me out. Give me your finger. Put it right there, it's all right. Okay, now don't move, anybody. Thank you baby. Get back here, Melanie. Melanie, get back here. Unless you want this thing to go off right now. All right, darlin' now let's get this out of the van. Come on, help me out, real careful. - Daddy, please don't do this. - Just help me get the rest of the stuff out. - No, I told you, I'm not going in there. - Now you got to understand one thing. This has already started and nobody can stop it, not even me. - Come on Mel, now you just do what he says, okay? Come on. - Excuse me. Hey, NRA? - God bless, 'em, huh. - Here, let me help. - Thank you. - Ow! - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry. - Take it easy. You almost took my wrist off. - Hey? Hey, hey! - Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Don't go driving away! Come here! - Hey! (people chattering) - Okay, kids, kids. Keep it down to a minor skirmish. I'll be right back. (guns clicking) (children chattering) Can I help you? - Yeah, where's the principal's office? - Just down the hall here, first door on your right. - Thank you very much. Melanie, stay here. (dramatic music) (Melanie gasping) - Oh hi. - Hi. - You're here about the kindergarten job. - Ah, yes I am. I'm a little bit early though. - Oh, that's all right, I just got back from lunch. Just give me a second, will ya. - Sure. - Can I help you? - Are you the principal? - Yes, I am. - Matt Eckhart. - That's right, now what is this-- - Matt, this school is being taken hostage. Don't push any buttons, don't step on any alarms, don't answer any telephones, just do as your told. - I'm sorry, I-- - Serious now, we've got guns. - [David] Matt, this is a bomb. This bomb's powerful enough to destroy this entire building, do you understand? - Now just wait a minute. - Sh, sh. You see this little half closed pin which is attached to my wrist? This is the only thing that is keeping this bomb from going off. And that means that if anybody attacks me or shoots me or trips me or even scares me so much that my arm moves a little bit too much, it will go off and everyone in this building will be killed. Miss. - Yes? - Get on the other side of the counter. - I'll just wait over here. - On the other side of the counter, now! Thank you. - You know, David, we could do it here. We'd be close to the phones. - No, we need the kids. - Terry not back with the mail yet? - Not yet, Jake-- - Ah, I'll get it later. - Hey Jake, come on back here. Yeah, I got a bomb too. - What? - Jake Downey. Don't you know me Jake? - Ah, no, I don't know you. - Well sure you do. David Young, remember? I rented a house from ya nine years ago. I was the police chief. - David Young, the cop. The one they fired. - They didn't fire me, Jake, I quit. You still single. - No. - No kidding. Wow, work with me Jake, you just might get to see your wife again. - Come on, let's go find a classroom. Move! (dramatic music) (people chattering) Excuse us, would you join our group please? This is a bomb and it's real. Let's go. What's in there? - First grade. - It's big. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, bring the guns. - No. - Melanie. Melanie, don't be a bad girl. Listen to Papa! - I told you, but you don't listen. I am not going in there. I am not doing this! I am not doing this! - It is a sad day indeed when a man's own daughter can't share her father's vision. (blow thuds) (dramatic music) Go on, get out of here. You're no good to me anyway. Go on, get out of here! (tense music) - David. How are we gonna get out of here? - Get us out of these cuffs. - No, just get us the hell out of here. (tires squealing) - Oh, Mr. Eckhart, and the ever popular Mr. Downey. To what do we owe the pleasure? What's going on? - Miss? - Michaels. - Miss Michaels, this is a bomb. - You gotta be kidding. - No, I am not kidding. So why don't you just sit down and shut up. (children laughing) Get the rest, Dorsie. - David, I think we got enough. - You think, Dorsie, you are not supposed to think. The plan says get everybody. Get everybody. - Look, how 'bout telling us what this is all about. - How about shutting up! When everybody it here I will tell you. I do not like repeating myself. Where are you going? - Oh, my I? (children crying) - Go ahead. - Sh, sh, sh, quiet. Sh. (tires squealing) - Help me, please, I need a cop. - Oh, I'm sorry, he's up in Kimber right now gettin' his car fixed. - Oh God. - Uh, maybe if you could tell me the nature of your emergency. - My father's holding a school hostage with a bomb. - I beg your pardon? - The school! Over there, the elementary school! Do something! He's got guns, he's got assault rifles, he's got a bomb! - Wait here. Don't you go away! (tense music) (door knocking) - Hi, Mrs. Michaels would like to see everyone in room four. - What for? - Well, I don't know, she just said that it was a big surprise. - Oh, well, class, I know you're gonna be disappointed but I guess long division will have to wait. (children cheering) - Yeah! - Oh great! - Let's go. - [Child] All right. - Nadine, I'm not a police woman, I don't know what to do? - You're the Sheriff's dispatcher, aren't ya? - No, I'm the new County Emergency Management Coordinator. - Well, if that girl's not wrong honey, you're in business in a big way. - [Jim] Would you like a tissue or a drink of water? - No, I don't want a tissue, dammit! - Now Miss, there's no need to use that kind of talk-- - Well what the hell kind of talk do you want me to say to get you idiots to stop my father before he kills the children, huh? - Okay, ma'am, all right, just slow down and take a breath please. What is your name? - Melanie. - Melanie. All right Melanie, can you tell me as calmly as possible what the problem is? (children chattering) - [Child] What do you. - [Child] Look at mine. - Okay, come on, this way, in here. - Hey everybody, find a place in the back of the room. No, hey, hey, no guns, no guns. Leave your guns by the door. Make a pile by the door, thank you very much. Find a place in the back of the room. - Give it to me, that's right. - I don't like their. - That's a good boy. No gun, that's right. - [Boy] Is he scared of guns. Yeah, let's shoot him with our plastic guns. - Get his gun. - Set right there. - Put your guns down. Come on, that's a good boy, that's it. - Now, do you believe me. - Nadine, let's get Sheriff Wolfley here, he's at Dr. Wilcox's. - I'll get Cal back here too. - Where are they? - [Kathi] Kemmerer, 50 miles away. Nadine, how many phone lines are in there? - [Nadine] Uh, four. - Jim, guys, let's split it up. I think we need the state trooper and the FBI. They're in Casper. - No, as soon as he sees any of those people he'll blow it up. I swear it. You gotta keep people away. - We need 'em. Tell 'em not to go near the school No sirens. Does anybody else have any other ideas? A road block, well let's go. Let's go. - Hey, hey, what about us? (tense music) (children chattering) (whistle whistling) - [Teacher] Okay kids, recess is over. - Ma'am. Ma'am! (dramatic music) Ma'am, don't go in the school. - Hi there! - Ma'am, no, no! Please don't go in. Ma'am! Oh what am I gonna do? (children chattering) - All right. Okay everybody, settle down now. Settle down, be quiet, be quiet. I got somethin' I gotta say. Now you all want to know what's goin' on. Well here it is. This is a bomb and you are all my hostages. All right. Now you adults, I want you to know right now, I could care less about you. I'd just as soon kill you as look at ya. But you kids, I am your friend. And you don't believe that yet but you will. I was a kid too once. And I know what it's like. Teachers, snarlin' at ya. Telling you what to do. Just pinchin' on the back of your neck, pulling you up by your ears. Shakin' your arms, slappin' your face, sit down, be quiet, sit in the closet. Get up, shut up. Button up, hands up, throw up. Wake up, look up! Straighten up, line up! Time's up! Well you're not gonna have to worry about any of that any more. Because we are gonna take the most important journey of our lives together. Except if you try to escape I'll have to shoot ya. I don't want to do it but I will. I'll use a .22 and I'll try to hit you in the legs but it will hurt, so just sit quiet. (girl whimpering) All right. Oh, let me have the statements now. Okay, now I want everybody, grown ups hand kids to read one of these. It will explain everything. Um, I just want you to know that I have already sent copies of this to the governor and the President of the United States. Pass 'em out. - All right now, who wants to help me pass these out, huh? Huh? Who wants to be letter monitor? - All right now. Listen up. Seemingly some thousands of years ago, several individuals combined or perceived their combination and therein created man. It was and is a concept. Neither right nor wrong, left but a way among ways. - Sit down. For the better part of the interim, man played with man, making love, fire, food. Moaris, children, goods, gods, language, tools, wastes, combinations of diverse sorts in almost as many directions, purposes. Now, people come and people go. But always as people. No longer as individuals from which people had risen or succumb. The answer to this concern regarding the nothingness. - Tom! There's some kind of lunatic in the school, it's on the radio. - What? - He's got guns and bombs. God, Tom, our babies. - I'm going down there. You get my coat. - All right, Tom, I'm comin' with ya. (dramatic music) (siren wailing) - Are we gonna die? - Don't be crazy, what are you talking about. - I mean, you know, see. - Tracy, I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you. - You smell the gas from the bomb. - Yeah. The kids are starting to get sick, you got any ideas? - No, he's got that thing around his wrist. - You know, Jake, if anybody's gonna do anything, it's you. - All we have, for all the lessons of history. - What do you want me to do, Jane? - Christ, revolutions, insurance. - We don't know what he wants yet. All we know is that he's inside the school and he's got guns and a bomb. - Where in the school, I got a kid in there. - We don't know yet. - Don't you think it's time you found out. - Ma'am, we don't want to endanger the lives of the children until we have a better idea of what's going on. - Meanwhile, they're all dead. I'll run you over. I don't even know who the hell you are. - I'm (sighs). I'm the Lincoln County Emergency Management Coordinator, sir. - What? What the hell is that? Where's Cal, where's the sheriff. - They're en route as are the Highway Patrol and the FBI. I'm telling you, you get in the vicinity of that school, that man has threatened to blow it up! (woman whimpering) Sir, what's your name please. - Um, Howard. - Howard, I'm gonna need your help, can you stay with me please. And ma'am? - Marlene. - Marlene. Can you go get the fire department and tell them no sirens. - [Marlene] Uh huh. (people chattering) - What's the trouble? - [Dorsie] He's got a fever. He needs to see a doctor. - No, he's not warm, he's not warm at all. You just wet a paper towel and you put it on his forehead and he's gonna be fine, aren't ya honey, just fine. (people chattering) - Look, why don't you call somebody, make your demands. We got a cellular phone. - I am not talking to any authorities. Jake, he's my negotiator. Back off! Dorse, they're crowding me. - No problem baby, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Moving it back girls. Don't want to make him nervous now do we, huh? - Okay, I'll call 'em for you. What do you want me to tell 'em. - You tell 'em I want $2 million for each kid. - Come on. - You got a problem. - It's just that there's gotta be 130 kids here. - 134 kids. And if Jake is not back in 10 minutes, there's gonna be 133. (gun clicking) - Oh no! (people gasping) - Would he do that? Would he shoot a child? - No. He wouldn't do that, that's just talk. - Well how can you be sure with someone like that? (upbeat music) (Dorsie gasps) (dramatic music) (people chattering) - I don't care what they say. - I've got to get in! (phone ringing) - This is Kathi Davidson. - I'm Jake Downey, I'm a teacher at the school. We're being held hostage. I was told to call you. What took you so long? I gotta be back in that classroom in four minutes. - [Kathi] Oh, well you'll have to speak fast then. - Okay, he's got a bomb, it looks real, it looks big and it's got a dead man's switch. - What is that, I don't know what that is. - It means if he gets shot or knocked out the bomb's gonna go off anyway. You gotta keep everybody back or we're gonna have a lot of dead kids here. - I'm trying. Where in the school is he? - Um, room four. The south side of the building, facing Pearl Street. He's got the whole school in there. 130 kids. A dozen adults. He's got a woman with him, calls her Dorsie. - Okay, what does he want? - You sitting down? - Hardly, sir. - He wants two million a kid. - What? - Exactly, what do I do? - I'm sorry, excuse me? - What the hell do I do? - Um, um, just sit tight. Everyone's on their way, I just have to relay this to the proper authorities. Just stay calm, Jake. - Yeah. (phone clicks) (dramatic music) (Jake gasping) (people chattering) - Hm. - Oh, he's here. (people sighing) - You tell 'em. - I told 'em. - What they say? - They said they'd call back after they contacted the proper authorities. - No cops, you tell I said no cops. - I told her. - Good. Take a pew, Jake. (people chattering) - I don't think there's that much money in the whole state of Wyoming. He must know that. What is he thinking. - Who knows any more. - Melanie? - I don't know. - Well do you have any ideas? - Well last night he started talkin' about some Brave New World he was going to with Dorsie. And how I ought to come along. - What Brave New World, what's he talkin' about. - I'm not real sure. - What do you think it means? - Well, ma'am, he believes in reincarnation. He might have meant reincarnation. - Are you saying that he aims to get killed today? - [Freddie] Damn, maybe that's what he was talkin' about on the mountain. - What did he say? - Well this morning when he cuffed us, we told him he'd never get away with this, there was no place he could hide and he said they'd never get him. And that he wasn't talkin' about Brazil. - Oh God. - It's the Brave New World he's talkin' about. A place he can control, where he thinks he's gonna be king. - But what does he mean about the kids not being brainwashed at all? And that they'd be kind to 'em and all? - You guys is nuts. David is not gonna kill hisself. He said he was gonna save those children. - Oh Lord, we could be talkin' about saving their souls, he could be talkin' about takin' every one of 'em with him. (sighs) (bright music) - [Instructor] Inhale and hold. Feel the stretch through the spine. Now move your body forward. - A heavily armed man with a bomb who has apparently taken control of the Cokeville Elementary School. We've received no word about any injuries or about any demands. But we do have our KROV news team en route to the scene and will inform you of any developments as they occur. - Oh my God, Jake. (tense music) - [Tom] What the hell's going on, Sheriff? - I just got here, Tom. You probably know more than I do. - Did you bring the money? This guy, he wants a truckload of money. - Yeah, I heard about that. - And? - And I heard about. We're handling this, Emma. - Doesn't look like it. - Excuse me, Dev, thank God you're here. - You seen Cal Frederickson? - No, he should be here by now. The FBIs due any minute and I've got Chuck Detrick from ATF out of Salt Lake on the radio. Says he can have 50 people here in three hours. - Let me get the lay of the land first. Anything else from inside. - No, sir, just the one call. Sheriff, I think we could have a Jonestown situation here. - You can tell that from one phone call? - No, I've been talking with his daughter. He's got some crazy idea about reincarnating everybody into a Brave New World. - [Woman] How long have the been in there? - He plan on reincarnating the money, too? - [Woman] There's nothing. (eerie music) (child coughing) - [Woman] I'm scared. - Oh please. (Jake sighs) - You were saying? - What was he like when you were his landlord? - Hardly ever saw him. Paid his rent on time. He stiffed me for two months after they fired him and he just took off. When I went over he trashed the place. - Mr. Downey, my sister's getting pretty sick from the smell of the gas. Can I open a window? - I'll ask him. - She's pretty scared too. - We all are, Cody. - Mr. Downey, we could take him. You could grab his arm and the rest of us could jump-- - Don't even think of it, Roy. - Who's that kid? - Just a kid. - Yeah? I think he's thinkin' about doing something stupid. - Look, everybody's getting sick from the gas fumes. Is it okay if we open a window? - No. - Come on, David, come on, huh. It's getting so hot in here. You know, we could open up a door, get a little cross-ventilation. - Be quiet. - [Jake] Last thing anything needs is a roomful of sick kids. - No. Last thing anybody needs is a dead teacher. Except me. (children gasping) - No! - Maybe I need a dead teacher. Teach everybody a lesson. Huh? Come on, mountain man. It's what you are, isn't it? Mountain man? Let's see what you're made of. Come on. (gun clicking) Forget about the gun. Let's just see if you can get to me before I can get to it. (tense music) - You'd blow everybody up. - If you don't get to me first. - All right, David, whatever you want. You're the boss. - I'm not the boss. I'm the king! People generally kneel to a king. (dramatic music) Right. Hit the phone, Jakey. (people chattering) - [Dev] Okay, but tell me exactly where they are. - I already told the woman. - [Dev] I know, calm down. You need to tell me. - On the Pearl Street side, the south side. - [Dev] Are the blinds up? - Come on, mister, you take one shot and we're all dead. Even if you get him. Where's the woman I was talking to? - [Dev] She's working on the money. You gotta deal with me now. - Well of course I'm gonna hold, I don't have a choice now do I? - [Dev] Okay. - Well cool it when you get near. We don't want to make any announcements. - What's he say, Dev? - I told him I'm bringing the governor into this. - I'm on hold now. - [Dev] Well did you tell him this is an emergency? - Of course I did! I didn't say it was a social call. - All right, all right. Well after you get through alert every hospital within 200 miles. - Yes, sir. - Okay, good news. SWAT team is coming in from Jackson. - SWAT team? I didn't authorize any SWAT team. - Come on, Dev, let's not get into this. Kidnapping's a federal crime, you know that. - I'll tell you what I know. I know the SWAT team's got all those expensive toys and all that expensive training. And I also know that when you're armed to the teeth, it's hard to be patient. - Same old Dev, huh. - But mostly what I know is this. Those are my people in there, my town, my county. And nobody, but nobody, goes anywhere near that school lest I say so. - Of course. - Just a moment, Sheriff. - [FBI Agent] Mind if we go over the van? - Be my guest. Better make that every hospital within 400 miles. Governor, yeah. (child coughing) (people chattering) - Go talk to him. - You wouldn't. - Oh yeah. - Go on, I dare ya. - Okay. Watch me. So, uh, what kind of guns are those? - Back off. - [Roy] I just want to know what kind of guns they are. - Yeah? - Yeah. (people chattering) - Alrighty. See that shotgun right there? That's one of the finest over and unders in the whole world. That one in the middle, it's a Kalashnikov assault weapon. - Yeah, fully automatic? - No. Not fully automatic. Semiautomatic. Fully automatic is illegal. (David scoffs) - Sit down. (people chattering) - Oh you're crazy. - Don't do that again. - Jake, you did the right thing. Listening to him. Nobody expects you to-- - Sure they do. So do you, Matt. (people chattering) - Now this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do and if we do anything else we're lookin' for a lot of trouble. Now the best thing we can do is wait for more assistance and more developments. - Like what? Like until the first child gets shot? I got my two kids in there, Cal. - I know, I'm tellin' ya they're all right. - Oh, Cal, is Jake okay? He's not much for taking orders from people. - I know, Laura. As of yet, no one's been hurt. - How do you know. How do you know he's okay? - You don't know? We've been talkin' to Jake on the phone. (Laura crying) - Leona's in there. She's got the sniffles, but I bullied her ma into making her go anyway. So you got Cody and what's the little one? - Tracy. - That's right. Cute little brunette. - What the hell's goin' on in there? - Looks like a whole lot of nothin'. Let's go down and see what's what. (people chattering) - [Teacher] How long you been married? - Nine years. Ever since David was police chief here. (laughing) Oh, I never could resist a uniform. - Dorsie, uh, why are you doing this? - Oh hell, you know men. They always think they can do this stuff by themselves but (sighs) I have to, girls. - No, nobody has to do something like this. You made a choice. - The others wouldn't help him. Not his friends, not his own daughter. You should have seen the look on his face when she deserted him. I know he won't. He doesn't think I saw him but, he needs me. - Dorsie, you know something real bad could happen here. - No, it won't. Now he is not gonna hurt the children. He cares about them. - That's why he has a bomb. - [Dorsie] I better go. - You can make sure that nothing happens. You wouldn't be hurting him, you'd be saving his life and a lot of others. - How? - Well, maybe you could get ahold of that shoelace thing. - [David] Dorsie! - I don't know, I gotta go. - At least convince him to let us open up the windows 'cause everybody's getting sick. - Dorsie, get over here! - Okay. (child coughing) (quiet tense music) - They say he's got a bomb with a dead man's switch. - How do they know, nobody's been in there? - No, but they've been talkin' to someone. What can you see? - [Larry] Window, it's gotta be the one. I can see kids. - Oh, Larry, I don't know if this is such a good idea. - No? Well let me tell you somethin'. If he gives me a head shot, I got a nine grain hollow point. (people chattering) - Okay, all right. All right. Okay, everybody, you want air, you got air. - Yay! - I'm not a hard man to get along with, ask anybody. (child coughing) Okay, scoot, come on, scoot. - Larry, what if they're right. - Quiet. Somebody's heading for the window. (dramatic music) Hey! - We're not gonna do this. - [Student] Hey, everybody, finally we get a breeze. (people chattering) - [Student] We got some air. - There now we can all breathe easy. - [Student] Thank you so much. - Hey, look. - Is it drugs? - Insulin. Someone's diabetic. - Bang, bang! - It's just a toy, see. - I can see what it is. I can also see that you people have no idea of how to control your children. No idea in the world. Do you! You call yourselves teachers! Imparters of knowledge. You are nothing but keepers. Prison guards. Well let me tell you something, in the Brave New World, a child will never, ever point a gun at an adult. Never, never, never, never, never. - Come on baby, hang in now, hang on. Hang on. Hang on. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Who's the diabetic. - [Charlie] Young according to the daughter. He last took it this morning. - When does he need it next? - Soon. - Well if it's here it ain't in there. - And maybe we're gettin' lucky, maybe he gets sleepy goes into a diabetic coma. - It doesn't happen like that. In fact-- - Charlie, call the lab, see what they can tell us. - Dev, the fact is that if he took it this morning and he hasn't had lunch, then the insulin's got nothing to work on except the sugar that's already in his system. He's gonna get hypoglycemic. He's gonna have low blood sugar, he's gonna go into insulin shock. - How do you know? - I, 'cause I have a friend who's diabetic, I know. He'll feel shaky, he'll start to sweat, he's gonna get hungry and thirsty and he's-- - And he's what? - And, that's it. - [FBI Agent] ATFs here. - Aw, hell, you were scared of us. - He's gonna get sweaty, hungry, thirsty and? - He's gonna get real irritable. He's gonna be subject to wide mood swings, Dev. - Thanks for keeping that to yourself. (people chattering) - Okay kids, whoever doesn't want to play game, watch some videos, okay. - Yay! - Yay! - I can't figure out if she's Ma Barker or Betty Crocker. - Neither can she. - Yeah, that's enough now. - Want me to rub somethin' else? - I said that's enough. - Okay. You don't have to bite my head off. (people chattering) Wow, that's real good. Boy I could, um, I could never stay in the lines like that when I was your age. - When that bell rings, do we get to go home? - Well maybe not right then, but soon you know, real soon. - How soon? - Look, I know some of you are a little afraid right now. But you ought to be thinking about this like one great big adventure, okay. You're gonna have some story to tell your grandkids. - She's nice. (people chattering) (David sighs) - You hear that? In 20 minutes when the bell goes off we're gonna be in trouble. - What do you mean? - Think about it, it's pandemonium. It's a reflex. You pick up your books and your lunch bucket and you go home. And if 100 kids jumping up at the same time doesn't set him off, what about the kids. These younger ones, after three o'clock when they see they're not going home and to their moms and dads, they're gonna panic. - So what do we do. Make some kind of announcement? - Well that might take the surprise out of it, but that bell's still gonna trigger a lot of emotions. If I could get out there I could disconnect it. - That's good, I sure wouldn't know how. - Hey, pst. Come here, come here, I want to talk to you. Look at this. - So. - It could cut your hair off with one swipe. - So what are you gonna do? Give him a haircut? - Cut the shoelace off his wrist and I need your help. So exactly two minutes before the bell goes off, you go up there, start asking him stuff about the guns. While he's talkin' about 'em, 'tween you and the bell going off, he'll be distracted. So Washburn, Kenny and Powell can go up there and grab his arm and keep it still and I'll cut the lace off. - Really, what if it doesn't work? - It'll work. Can't just wait around here for this guy to blow up. (people chattering) - [Announcer] What they figure Eddy by welcoming one of the all time greatest skating stars and expert commentators Art... - [TV Character] We've got some friends-- - Everybody, now listen up here. Elizabeth is feelin' kind of sad and I think maybe we could sing her a song, try and cheer her up, what do you think. I know one. ♪ If you're happy and you know it clap your hands ♪ (children clapping) ♪ If you're happy and you know it clap your hands ♪ (children clapping) ♪ If you're happy and you know it ♪ ♪ Then your face will surely show it ♪ ♪ If you're happy and you know it clap your hands ♪ (children clapping) (ominous music) ♪ If you're happy and you know it shout hooray ♪ ♪ Hooray ♪ ♪ If you're happy and you know it shout hooray ♪ ♪ Hooray ♪ ♪ If you're happy and you know it ♪ ♪ Then your face will surely show it ♪ ♪ If you're happy and you know shout hooray ♪ ♪ Hooray ♪ ♪ If you're happy and you know shout hooray ♪ ♪ Hooray ♪ ♪ If you're happy and you know it shout hooray ♪ ♪ Hooray ♪ ♪ If you're happy and you know it ♪ ♪ Then your face will surely show it. ♪ ♪ If you're happy and you know it shout hooray ♪ ♪ Hooray ♪ (children clapping) (people chattering) (clock ticking) - Two minutes before the bell goes off, he's gonna go up there an talk to him. And we'll have Kenny. - Here goes. - What, what do you want? - You don't look so good, David. Uh, why don't you let me get something for ya, you know, whatever you need. I'll call somebody. - Yeah, all right. Okay yeah, let's make a phone call. Matt! Jake here is up to somethin' so I'm promoting you to phone monitor. I want you to make a call, find out what's goin' on with that money and I want you to get me something to eat. - Uh, what do you want? - Something sweet, juice or candy bars, I don't care. I don't care what it is, just be back in five minutes. - I'll need more time than that. - Five minutes. - That's not-- - Five minutes, I'll start shootin' kids. (guns clicking) Go on! - He's got two guns. - Two guns. - Two guns. - Shooting. (clock ticking) - Honey, you're gonna need your medicine. - I'm fine, all I need is a little bit of food. - No, you are not fine. You need your insulin. Now why don't you tell what's his name to get some for you. - Oh, sure, why don't I have him bring it to me so they can put something in it. Why don't you just get away from me you stupid bitch! Don't you realize that in the Brave New World I will no longer need insulin! In the Brave New World our bodies will not be ravaged by the common ailments of man. Children will not longer be puking and I will no longer need a gun to rule. (ominous music) - Okay. - Why, what's the gun gotta do with it, we gotta get the rope. (people chattering) - Jakey! Front and center. (people chattering) Closer. All right, that's close enough. Now somebody is planning something stupid in here. Somebody other than you. - I, I don't think so. - I don't care what you think. - Well look, ah, what if we protect you then. I'll protect you from these children. - How? - Well we could, you know we could draw a circle, tape a circle around you and no one can cross over it. - Okay, you do that. Make it a wide one. - [Matt] Listen, I think he's sick. He's sweating like a stuck pig. - [Kathi] He's diabetic. - That doesn't make any sense. He asked for candy. I thought-- - Well, we don't have time to explain you just have to make sure he gets something sweet, quick. - Okay, okay, what about the money. We gotta make him some kind of offer. - It's in the works. We talked to the governor. Right now the food's more important. Have you got something there. - Ah, yeah, yeah. (tense music) - [Dev] You can tell him no, we can send some in there, put him to sleep. - There's no time for that. He's about to explode, I mean literally. I gotta go. (people chattering) (clock ticking) Oh God. (people chattering) - All right Jake, you tell 'em anybody crosses that line's gonna get shot. - All right, I'll tell 'em. (clock ticking) You see this line here? This circle? Well we're gonna call it a magic circle and, uh, they're the only ones allowed inside the circle. Everyone else has to stay outside. - What happens if we don't? - Well then you're out of the game. (David laughs softly) (clock ticking) - [Student] Mr. Eckhart's back. (Jake sighs) - Cutting it rather close, aren't we Mr. Principal, sir. - Whatever you boys are planning, it's over, you understand me? - But, Mr.-- - Over! (people chattering) - [Child] Look at that. - [Child] You're getting sick, eat it. - [Child] That must be good I want. Why can't he even be sick. - [Child] Look at how fast he's eating that. - [Child] Ew, he's really cramming it in. - [Child] Ew, he's scared. (children laughing) (people chattering) - Give me more. - [Child] How can he eat so much at one time? - [Dispatcher] 5-0 to George, this is. - [Dispatcher] 5-0 George. - [Dispatcher] 5-0 George (speaking faintly). - So no lunch and he's under a lot of stress, what's he like when his sugar's low? - Crazed. That's when he'd bang us around. He's gonna be crazed, ma'am. Isn't there somebody, I mean with all this firepower, somebody's gotta. - [Man] Bring your guys over here. - God. I can't believe I'm suggesting somebody kill my father. - [Man] Channel four. - [Man] Channel four to walk. - First the man is asking for 270 million. And you can't get anybody to authorize one million. - That's not what we're pursuing-- - Second his own daughter says he's probably planning to blow everybody into this Brave New World of his anyway. He keeps asking for 300 million, right. But never once has he asked for an escape vehicle. - What's the rush here boys? He's been in there what? Goin' on two hours. So far everybody's alive. - Dev, but I've been talkin' to his daughter. She says he gets crazed when his blood sugar's low, I mean, I mean, really crazed. - He just had a candy bar and some juice, didn't he? - Yeah, it's just a stop gap, you can't regulate a diabetic with just candy and juice. He's had no lunch, he's under a ton of stress. He could just lose control of his blood sugar levels and... - Well what about gettin' some of your mickey juice into his food, make him sleepy. - Okay, we'll helicopter it in from Salt Lake. - Two hours. - That's right. - We can get some men in the rear door without being observed. Principal says the classroom door is open. In all probability we can maintain an air of surprise. My guys are armed with S20 longs. Come on, we can immobilize him where he stands. - Oh, he'll freeze on his feet like a statue. Please boys. - We can wait til he sits down. - [Man] No, we don't know what exactly we're dealing with as far as his firepower. (radio chattering) - God be with us all. (people chattering) - Listen, (drowned out by people chattering). (dramatic music) (people chattering) - Dorsie! Dorsie, they got somethin' goin'. I know it. - David, come on now. Just relax, okay. Just relax. You know what this is? It's your blood sugar doin' loopy-de-loops from all those candy bars you had. - Uh uh. - Sure it is. - Uh uh. - Come on, it's okay. You know, maybe you should go to the bathroom. - I really do gotta go. - I know you do, baby. I know you do. You're squirmin' here like a little froggie. Look at you. Come on, it's okay. I'll take it, you go on. - Dorsie. - Sweetie what are you gonna do, pee in your pants? Huh? - I don't know. - Aw, baby, it's okay. It's okay. I'm right here. It's okay. Listen. I started this because I love ya. And I'm gonna finish it for the same reason okay. - Okay, okay. - It's gonna be okay. - Okay, okay. - Come. Give that to me. (dramatic music) - He's taking off the bomb. He's taking off the bomb. - That's good. (dramatic music) - Dorsie, you take care of my children for me. - I will. - Every single one of them is precious in the Brave New World. Alrighty. - Okay. - Okay. - You go on now. - All right. - Go on, go on. - [FBI Agent] The woman has the bomb, the woman has the bomb. He's leaving, he's leaving the room. - Is she hooked up to the switch? - Is she hooked up to the switch, over? (ominous music) (bomb booming) (Kathi gasping) (dramatic music) (women screaming) - Get out now! - Get out! - [Man] Where's that guy from Los Angeles! (gun firing) - [Dev] Get down! Everybody down. - You're shooting the kids. - Get down! - Don't get shot! - Get back! (gun firing) - Get back! - Get back! (children screaming) - [Teacher] Kids, kids come on. Wendy! - Get down. - You're gonna be all right. - Is anybody hurt. - Gotta get the kids out. - Jesus Christ. - Help. Help! Help! Help me! - Dorsie! Get back! (gun firing) - Get back! - Get down. Get down! - Help me. - Dorsie! Dorsie! Dorsie, oh my God. - David. - Oh baby, I'm sorry. Dorsie I'm so sorry. - Help, help. Help, help. - [Matt] Let's go, come on, everybody out. - Bye baby. (gun firing) (people screaming) (guns firing) - Out the front door! - I'll take the front door! - Get the kids out. Send 'em out the front! - [Jake] I'll get 'em out the window. (children screaming) - [Matt] Don't stop running til you get to the street, all right everybody out. Everybody out, that's right, you're all right. That's right, you're all right, you're all right. Big kids look out for the little kids. Everybody out, lets go. - What's going on. Sounds like a war. - I'm gonna get this bastard. - [Jake] Come on, come on, let's go. Come on. - Everybody out, let's go, down the hall. - [Man] Come on kids. (people screaming) (girl crying) - [Girl] It hurts. - Get back, get back. Fire and police only, come on kids this way. Come on! - We got gunshots, burns, smoke inhalation, we need every medevac helicopter you can get. - [Dispatcher] 10-4. - Thank you. - Come on, keep going. Look after her. All right, anybody else? Jake that's it over here. Do you need any help? - No, just a couple more. (dramatic music) (Jake coughing) Okay Cody. Come on, you hit the ground running, sir. - Tracy! Have you seen Tracy! - Anybody else? - Tracy! - Anybody else? (dramatic music) - [Emma] Cody! Cody! - Daddy! - That's it, come on, come on. Come on. - Jake, Jake! - [Man] Come on, come on, let's go. - Jake! (crying) - Jake have you seen my sister? - Uh no, Cody. - Pa! - Wait. Cody, no, don't go back, kid. - [Laura] Jake! (children screaming) (people coughing) - [Cody] Tracy, Tracy, where are you? - [Jake] Cody! Cody! - [Jake] Tracy! Tracy! - Cody! Come on, we gotta get out of here. - Oh, wait, Tracy! - Come on! - Oh, all right. You go that way. - Okay, Tracy! - Tracy! - Tracy, where are you! - Tracy. - [Cody] Tracy! (gun firing) - Did you get him? - I don't know. (bullets clattering) - [Cody] Tracy! (dramatic music) (Cody screaming) - [Jake] Cody, what is it? Did you find her. - Freeze! You move and I'll blow your damn head off. - Oh my God. - Put the gun down. Put the damn gun down. - Are you all right? - Yeah, no thanks to you. - I saw the gun, and I don't know what I thought, I heard gunshots. - Well that's the heat from that fire exploding the extra ammo. - [Cody] Hang on Tracy, you're gonna be okay. - Cody! - [Cody] Hang on! - [Tom] Cody! - Easy. - Tracy. - Easy, get her to the hospital. - Her skin. - She's still breathing. You're gonna be okay honey. - [Emma] Tom, Tracy! How is she. - I gotta get her to the ambulance. - [Laura] Oh Jake. (crying) - It's all right, sh. It's okay, baby. It's all right. It's all over. - Fourth grade over here. - Over here. - [Teacher] Fourth grade's over here. - We have to check you out. Parents, bring your kids over here before they go. Over here. (helicopter blades whirring) - My father? (sirens wailing) - I'm sorry. (Melanie whimpering) I'm sorry. The woman's gone too. I'm so sorry. (radio chattering) - How many children? - None so far. A teacher got shot and there's some bad burns but other than that, everybody else is pretty much accounted for. - How can that be? - I don't know. - Excuse me. We need you to make a formal identification. - Oh, Dev, can she do that tomorrow? - Yeah, sure. - No. It's all right. Where. - Town hall. We don't have a morgue. - [Dispatcher] 10-4. - Kathi, pretty good day's work. - Oh, always happy to lend a hand. - Thank you. - Thank you, Dev. (gentle music) - Yeah. Could I have a few minutes? - Sure. (somber music) (Melanie crying) - Goodbye, Daddy. (somber music) (birds chirping) (people chattering) - [Child] Can't be late. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Very late though. - Already? (people chattering) (angelic vocalizing) - [Miss Micheals] Hello Tracy, nice to see you. - [Teacher] Tracy, welcome back. - No. I'm scared. - Tracy, two weeks ago when you were in the hospital, there was this sort of doctor. She said it was okay for us to be scared as long as we went back into the room. - No! - As long as we went back into the room, saw there was nobody there and we took it back, then we wouldn't be afraid. All the kids did it. - Did you? - I was waiting for you. (angelic vocalizing) - What are these? - That's another thing the doctor said. She said if we went back into the room and we wrote our names on the floor, it would be like a sign that we were here but we were okay now. You want to do it? I think I will. - (laughs) She's gonna be okay. But what about you? You've been pretty quiet the last couple of weeks. We let you down, we adults? Should have taken care of this lunatic sooner. - I thought about it. But, I also know sometimes it's just better to wait. How come none of us were killed? - Well the bomb guys say only half of it went off. The windows were open, the doors, let out the force of the blast. - What's that? - I'm not sure. But maybe it's where God stood. (people chattering) (angelic vocalizing) (gentle music) (Multicom Jingle)
