- Free my arms...please... Just for a moment. - I'm thirsty. It's hot. - You got water there. - I can't drink like this! Bert, hello, give us a hand. - What? - Number 34. 34? Missed a calmer night... - Who's he want? - Wants a drink. I must have my arms free. I must have my arms free. Doctor said not to... Still, he's having his dinner party upstairs, isn't he? All he wants is a drink of water. Might shut him up then. - Please, Rowse, just a drink. I'm better now. Needs another drink. Thank you. If you just free my arms. I'm better now. There are two of you. Come on then. Over here, that's it. That's right. - Undo it. - That's it. - Back! - Stop him! Stop, he's getting free! Get him back! - Oh, thank you, Mrs. H. - Thank you, sir. Master! Master! - Couldn't hold him, sir. - It's all right. It's all right. Get up. You will go back to your room. Now. - Do you know him? - No, Dr. Seward. But you... I must beg your pardon, Doctor, and ladies, and yours...sir. Count Dracula, are you sure you...? I have not the pleasure of this gentleman's acquaintance, Dr. Seward. Come dear ladies, sit down. Now gently, it's all over. There's no more danger. Just sit quietly and you'll be quite all right. There we are. Count, it seems impossible to believe... The mind has long been a subject of interest to me, Dr. Seward. I've found your own treatise on the subject quite fascinating. Though, may I say, simply as an amateur, I beg to differ with you on certain questions. Indeed? Oh, Mrs. H, there's some broken glass. There's no panic, but I wonder if you could clean it up? Mrs. Weston, pray accept my profoundest apologies. - Oh, that poor, poor man. I think we might all be more comfortable in the study. - Oh, yes. - Yes, of course. Ah, dear lady, are you sure there's nothing I can get you? Oh, no thank you no, John. I'm sure Lucy and I will be quite comfortable. well, I think the evening's been somewhat disrupted now, I'll get Roberts to take you both home. No, John, that won't be necessary. We told Radley to be here by nine. Tell me, what do you know of that poor fellow, or does my curiosity press some professional etiquette? Well, he was the sole survivor of a Russian barque called 'The Demeter' which was wrecked off the west cliff a month or so ago. He appears to be English, and that's all we know of him. - Count Dracula, did you not journey from Varna aboard The Demeter? - Yes indeed Miss Weston, - but I was fortunate enough to disembark at Rotterdam. - I had some business to attend to. - Could you perhaps have encountered my patient on your voyage? - He may have joined the ship after I left it. In any event I saw very little of either passengers or crew, my habit being, as you know, nocturnal. The daylight is painful to me. - Oh, poor Count! Can nothing be done? John, surely you can suggest something? I'm afraid the Count's condition is quite outside my field of study. You ate nothing at dinner. Even your glass was untouched. I do not drink wine. - I'm a poor guest, doctor. I apologise. - Not at all. Tell me, what is your diagnosis of that patient, if I may ask? Well, I've hardly arrived at one yet, but my former tutor, Professor Van Helsing has promised to examine him the day after tomorrow. Professor Van Helsing is a renowned authority. He has no name, your patient? No. To us he is known only as '34'. That is his room number. We can tell him nothing of his background, no relatives have come forward? None. If you'll forgive me, Mrs. Weston, I think I'd better go and see 34. Goodnight Lucy. His behaviour's changed of late. He's become quite incomprehensible. Oh, of course, John. How thoughtless of us. I'm sure we can entertain ourselves till the carriage comes. Play for us again, Count. No need to wait, Roberts will drive you. It will save your coachman turning out. And you, Count, perhaps you could join us? I shall be delighted. My activities are so restricted during the day. I've seen very little of Whitby. I shall explore the town after our journey. A moonlight stroll, perhaps? Yes, you see, the moon is full tonight. Yes, so, if you'll excuse me, Mrs. Weston. Dr. Seward, I would welcome an opportunity to meet Professor Van Helsing, if the many calls on his time permits. I have long wished to cross swords with your eminent friend. Metaphorically speaking, of course. Number 34. He did not stir until the day before yesterday, and then this sudden outburst. Somnambulent during the day but restless and excitable... - Violent even at night? - Yes, I'm afraid so. The changes occur between sunrise and sunset? That's right, professor. You say he has an insatiable desire to consume all forms of animal life? Perhaps he has become zoophageous? Zoophageous! Yes, I see... Talks wildly of someone or something he calls 'The Master'. Very well... The metamorphosis you described could take place within the hour. Yes. Open up, Jenkins. May I suggest we put the jacket on him, sir, it's nearly time? No, no. Just wait within call. Thank you. We are not to be disturbed. Doctor, a little more meat... meat and more sugar. - I yearn for meat and sugar. - Yes, and the flies? Oh yes, my friends like it too, see... I grow fat on their innocent greed. They also serve, doctor. They also serve the master. You seem fatigued. Come, sit down. Sit. So, we will talk, eh? You're tired... So tired... Now, tell me of the master. He mustn't find me wanting should he summon me. I must be ready for his call. Of course, as one so honoured, you must. Honoured? Yes, honoured! You were called. You were chosen. How...and when? Blood is life... Blood is life... Those were his words. I was afraid... Afraid of him. But then I didn't know. I disobeyed him. But he was merciful. I have a destiny. He told me not to venture beyond my apartments. He always came to me after nightfall. I knew I must not linger. Back! Back, I command you! He is mine! - Who is your master? - Not now! Master. Master! We Szekely's have a right to be proud. In our veins runs the blood of many a proud race who fought as the lions fights for lordship. Transylvania is the whirlpool of Europe. It was there that the Obříchs from Iceland came The Obříchs, imbued by the fighting spirit of Thor and Wodin, who sent their Berserkers to conquer the world. Men said the Werewolves from Selz had come. In Transylvania the Ubrich's found the Huns. With war-like fury they swept the earth like a living flame, and it was said that veins ran with the blood of those witches of old who, expelled from Sibiu, had mated with devils in the desert. Fools! What witch, what devil was ever so great as Attila, whose blood runs in these veins? To us, for centuries, was entrusted the guarding of the frontier with the Ottoman. 'Water sleeps. The enemy is sleepless', so runs the ancient Turkish saying. Wallach and Mejia went down beneath the crescent moon but it was a Dracula who crossed the Danube and defeated the infidel on his own ground. It was a Dracula who led the Szekely's when they threw off the Hungarian yoke, at bloody Mohacs. All these upstarts! Hapsburgs and Romanos, compared to our ancient line that stretches back to and beyond blood-crazed Attila himself. Blood is too precious in these days of dishonourable peace. The glories of the greatest of all races are a tale which is told. The final chapter's not written, dear Count, while yet one of your noble race lives! You are wise, Miss Weston, for one so young. Yes, the blood that runs in these veins is warm. The sacred trust of my ancient house demands, come what may, it must not slacken. - Not at all dear lady. - Thank you, John. You're so kind. I beg your pardon. Your mother told me you were alone. I was. Goodbye, Miss Weston. I have trespassed already too much upon your hospitality. Oh, pray don't leave us on Dr. Seward's account. He is here principally to see my mother. I have just seen your mother, Lucy, and I'm afraid she's not at all well. I've advised complete res, seclusion even. Oh surely not! We see so few new faces and mother has so enjoyed making you acquaintance here Count, I, I feel it's quite taken it out of herself. - Lucy, your mother's condition is serious. - John, you're being so curt. Lucy, you must understand! Well, in fact, I only came to tell you that Mrs. Harker is here. Mina? - Mina? - Mrs. Harker, madam. - Oh, Mina! - My dear. So glad you could come. You must stay as long as you possibly can. On that I have little to detain me at home. Oh, hush dear. All be well. - Mina, you know Dr. Seward? - How nice to see you. - I saw your carriage. - I want you to meet Count Dracula. - Count Dracula? - Who has recently arrived from... - So you know my husband? - Madam? - Oh, Mrs. Harker, please. - He journeyed to your castle, sir. Oh, yes indeed, Mrs. Harker. On business he could not confide in me. I profitted much from his brief stay with me. A most excellent man of business and a rewarding companion. Where is he? I look forward to renewing his acquaintance more than I can say. What became of him? Became of him? Is he not here in England? Poor Mina's husband disappeared while on visit. I did not realise it was to Castle Dracula. It was your wish his destination should remain secret, I believe, Count? Yes. Yes. I have many enemies in my native land. That was my reason for enjoining your husband to say nothing of his destination. But has he not returned? He left my castle in the best of good health and spirits. He was even kind enough to write to me from Prague. Charming. A quite unmerritted letter a thanks. I also had a letter from Prague, but thereafter, nothing. You are indeed unfortunate in your loss, Mrs. Harker. Let us hope however it is merely temporary. In the meantime, if there's anything I can do, any way I can be of help, I am of course, yours to command. I cannot but feel in part responsible for poor Mr. Harker's misfortune. You are generous, sir. Indeed Count, you are too kind. Morley? Been playing your little games again, have you? - I'll make the bed, sir. - That's all right. - Just outside if you want me, sir. - Good. Sir, a dog, a little puppy dog. A dog for me to play with, sir. It would come to no harm, sir. It would be part of me, in time. We shall see. We shall see. You spoke yesterday of 'The Master'. Tell me of him. Few are chosen. Few are called to serve. He asks much of those so honoured. Everything. What manner of man is he to command such loyalty? Mighty! I'm really very concerned. It seems quite impossible to persuade Lucy of the gravity of her mother's condition. Her attitude is extraordinary. I would think her callous...if I didn't know how sweet and tender she really is. Perhaps if I had Count Dracula's persuasive powers I might... You and the Count exact too great an influence over Lucy, Dr. Seward. No... Yes! Let me confess it, I'm jealous! - Jealous! She seems remote from me. - Dr. Seward, please! Lucy and I have no secrets from each other. She loves you, Dr. Seward, have no doubt. We've written to each other daily since my marriage. She wrote of nothing and of no one but you. Thank you. The Count has some kind of... Shall I offend you if I speak of girlish infatuation? The Count has charm, looks, intelligence, breeding, and above all, he has a quality few generous hearts can resist- melancholy. A melancholy born of suffering bravely endured. What suffering? Ah! Noble reticence is yet another weapon in his formidable armoury. But Lucy and I are to be married. How can she... Oh, doctor, be patient. - well, I don't like the fellow. - There's something about him... -Mina. Mina. Come. Mina! Clear the way. Jonathan! Mina, Mina? Oh, he's started recognising me! Now you must not exert yourself. - gently. - Oh, Johnathan! Madam, you have me at a disadvantage. Jonathan, it's Mina, your wife. Your name means nothing to me. Is this some scheme of yours, doctor? Some effort to disturb? Raise questions of self-doubt? Then probe, disorientation, then probe? Calm down. You're all right. Listen! He calls me. Master! Cut off.. Forgotten. You! No, Miss, there don't seem to be no one livin' there at all. Thank you, Rodney, but I think I'll look myself. Very well, Miss. Home, Rodney, and don't spare the... Never mind. He recognised her, obviously, yet something stopped him. Now what, John? This has happened before with this patient, professor. The pattern is recognition, identification, then rejection. This happened before, when? Well, the other night we had a certain Count Dracula here Not at my direct invitation let me say. Lucy and Mrs. Weston seemed quite bowled over by the fellow. Well, 34 broke out of his room and burst in on us. It was the most pitiable exhibition. Positively fawned on our romantic exile, and then a repetition of he incident this evening. A quite normal apology for mistaken identity. Oh, no, no ,no. That must have startled your guest. Ah, thank you, Mrs. H. Well, as a matter of fact, he showed remarkable presence of mind. Two of my most experienced attendants failed to restrain 34, but a word from the Count calmed him instantly. Perhaps this Count shares my interest in mesmerism? - He did mention something of the kind. - Indeed? Wait. 34 and Harker are the man, that we know. Harker and Dracula were constant companions a month or so ago, but Dracula claimed not to recognise him. Now isn't that suspicious? Is it possible the Count has something to hide? John, we must not let our personal feelings get the better of us. Harker was so changed his unfortunate wife could scarcely recognise him. I don't trust the fellow. John, after you left, Harker spoke of his desertion by The Master. Is that a good sign? Yes, if he's rid of this particular obsession then... Then we advance...but where? Rock of ages, cleft for me Let me hide myself... Oh, they're here again. - Happy noon day. - Good afternoon Mr. Swales. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr. Swales. Well...it won't be long before I joins 'em, hey? There's a little chuckle. I has a little chuckle reading the inscriptions now. These lovely buds, so young and fair, called hence they go. Just came to show how sweet a flower in paradise may bloom. And a proper little tart she were... Mr. Swales, surely it's disrespectful to the dead. To have 'em writing lies. Lies! Sure enough. Here: Sacred to the memory of George Cannon who died in the hope of a glorious resurrection falling from the rocks in Kettleness. this tomb is erected by his sorrowing widow. Mother to her dearly beloved only son. Mr. Swales, I think that's disrespectful and quite unchristian to speak of... 'Twas her who was unchristian. She drove him to it. She did, mind the word is he cut his throat from ear to ear. A proper old bizzam she were. Mr. Swales, I thought it said he fell? Ah, fall he did, but from no rocks, no. 'Twere from that bridge over the railway there, with the London Express roaring through Bosham cut in. - Tore to pieces he were. - Mr. Swales, stop, I beg you! Glorious resurrection... come Gabriel's horn, won't be more than my hat for poor George left to answer the call. empty that...and unconsecrated, you know? Him bein' a suicide. Ain't holy ground. Lucy, it's becoming quite chilled. - I promised your mother we'd be... - I like a little chuckle for the day. Indeed you do, Mr. Swales. Well, we bid you good night until tomorrow. Good night. - I do so enjoy our little chats. - Me too, me too. Good night. - Good night, Mr. Swales. - Good night, Miss. Lucy, I wish you wouldn't encourage him. Oh, Mina. Don't be so governing. He's a marvellous old Captain. I'm afraid I find him quite unpleasant. Come dear. The night air can do us no good. I called on Count Dracula this afternoon. - Lucy! - What? Surely you didn't go alone? He was out. It was quite strange. The house was empty. No servants. No one. Dust sheets over everything. - So strange... - Lucy, you really mustn't compromise yourself like this. Think of Cr. Seward. Of John! John is... so taken up with his work he scarcely has time to think of anything else now. It seems to me, if I may say so, that it's you who scarcely has any time for him, and I for one am more than grateful to his devotion to poor Jonathan. Poor Count...to suffer so much yet to bear no malice. Such charm. Such good manly intelligence. I find him... almost sinister. Oh, you are just affected by John's silly prejudice. I find him fascinating. Quite fascinating. Only yesterday she seemed so vital. Professor Van Helsing, not to worry, is here. Yes. - Professor Van Helsing, Madam. - Calm yourself, Herr Frau. Calm yourself! Mrs. Weston, is it not enough we have one invalid on our hands? We cannot afford another. - Come John, where is our patient? - Oh, let me. - No, I would prefer we saw her alone. - Oh, John! Under the circumstances, Mrs. Weston, I think it would be better. shall remain within call should you need me. Thank you. Thank you. - The mother? - Yes. Severe angina pectorism. Am I right? - yes, I'm afraid so. - She's not been told? Not in so many words. I've warned her, of course. It's only a matter of time, John, you realise that? So we must proceed with caution, and be guarded in our reports. Pulse faint...erratic... Your findings? I can find no cause. There appears to be a massive loss of blood, but there's no visible wound, and there's no indication of any internal haemorrhage. Gott im Himmel! What is it? - Professor, what... - John. John, I'm about to ask you something I have no right to ask as one medical man to another, only as a friend. I think a transfusion of blood is called for. Is essential... - But how can we take the risk? - I know that you share many of the ethical and medical doubts, sincerely held by many of our colleagues. Is Lucy's life in danger? I fear so. But how...why? John, you must trust me. We must act in secrecy, and now. I would offer myself without hesitation but, well, my years... No, no. - Very well. - Good. And now we must return to the asylum to make ourselves ready... I will do what I can to calm Mrs. Weston's fears. But remember, John, secrecy is essential. - Should we get someone to sit for us? - No, no! - Mrs. Harker, surely? - No, I would rather she were left alone. Now there's nothing to be done for her till we return. She will be safe enough... until nightfall. See, she responds already. She needs more. So little has done so much. Do not concern yourself with me. Of course, that's if she remains as she is. Undisturbed rest will soon put her on the road to recovery. - I'll stay with her. - No. We don not risk any excitement should she wake. You area little stronger. You better drink this. Then you must rest. When you are a little stronger I will summon the carriage. - God, man! what are you doing? - John, I... Haven't I borne enough? This I endured against my principles in the name of science. That popish affront to Christian conscience, I cannot endure. John, we must seek help from every, from any quarter. Superstition. Rank superstition. I act as a man of science. Incredible as that may seem to you now... There isn't enough scientific justification for that! John, believe me, I know more in the ways of... I can only give open expression to what are, as yet thank God, only suspicions. I can only swear to you John, swear by all that both of us hold holy that I act solely for the life of that young girl. These suspicions... Why can't you confide in me? But John, think of your reactions to this crucifix. I fear that if I told you what I'm thinking I would try your patience too far. - What? - No, trust me. Both John and the Professor have given strict instructions that she's not to be disturbed on any account. They've even locked her door... and taken away the key. No harm can come to her. She's in your own room within easy call should she need anything. Trust in John's devotion and the Professor's great knowledge and experience, Mrs. Weston. You must obey them. They say she's in a coma but improving. There is nothing to be done, they assure me, but if only I could see her. Oh, but how thoughtless and selfish of me. How's poor Jonathan? Quite unchanged I'm afraid. He doesn't even recognise me. Perhaps our chance meeting was too much for him after all he'd been through. All he speaks about when he speaks is having been deserted, abandoned. Abandoned? - By whom? - Some figment of his imagination. The Master. 'He has another now' were his words last evening. Even Dr. Seward seems baffled and the Professor strangely silent. He urges me to be patient, and I can be. - Just as I intended. - Professor Van Helsing, madam. - Mrs. Weston. - Oh, darling Professor. Oh, but surely, Kirk's could have provided me food? - No, that won't be necessary. - No, no, no. - May I? - No you may not. - Oh, John! - Really, dear lady, please be patient. Yes, but everything is taking so long. It is much better that we should see her first. God! - Light it up. - What is it? Bring my bag, quickly. A second transfusion is vital. Meine göttliche Mutter Gottes! I'm ready. Professor, what is this? First things first. Are you out of your mind? The transfusion, man! It will avail her nothing unless she is protected Protected, from what? By flowers of garlic?! Please, John help me and I'll explain. - But for heaven's sake, Professor! - Do not argue. Tie these stems tightly. We must have unbroken rings. I suppose here few have not even heard of vampires. Vampires? Of heard of superstitions that mythical beings were supposed to exist in a bygone age, that drank the blood of others. Yes, well Lucy has been attacked by one. Preposterous! What in heaven's name are you asking me to believe? This is the Nineteenth Century man, we're men of science. Well, what then is your explanation? Men of science deal in facts. Let us remunerate them. One: Lucy in perfectly good health two days ago suffers a massive. loss of blood sometime during the night. So great an effusion in fact that her very life is in danger. Two: we can find no cause for this loss. No external wound will account for it. No indication of internal haemorrhage. Three: after our transfusion this morning we return, and what do we find? That within a matter of hours her condition is worse, if anything than it was before. Again, shall we say, there is no rational explanation. Well, what is the inescapable conclusion? That not once but twice enormous quantities of blood have been drawn off. But how, John? By whom? Answer me that! - There must be some explanation. - I have given you one. A legendary monster? A fantasy creature from the age of superstition. The only possible hypothesis from which we can proceed. If you cannot accept it at least do not hinder me. - What do you propose to do? - Work, work, work. We have wasted precious time. Vampires are subject to laws. Some are stronger in their ability to withstand the natural law than others, but all are subject to the ascendancy of the cross properly sanctified. But you placed a cross on Lucy's bed. well, it was dislodged. Probably by the poor child herself. Accidentally, I hope. Nonetheless, if the doors and windows of the victim's room are encircled with unbroken chains of garlic flowers, no vampire can enter. - Professor! - Believe me, John, this simple remedy is as old as the force we seek to overcome. But we can defend her. I'll have her taken to the asylum and kept under lock and key. John, we are no match for him, my friend. He is far stronger than us. As for locks and keys- you saw for yourself, the window was secured! Well inspect it! You will find no sign of a forced entry. But surely if we were to keep watch, hidden in the room... John, we do not know what we should be looking for. No. No, it is better we rely on this age-old remedy. Besides, if we can succeed in frustrating him, he may grow careless, and then we may perhaps rid not only Lucy but the world of this monster. - Destroy? - Yes. There are means. But we must know more of our adversary, before we can avail ourselves of him. Believe me, John, in his destruction lies the only surety of Lucy's salvation. Now, forgive me, my dear friend, if I seem impatient, but there is still much to be done. We are best to leave by the window. There is less chance of breaking the chains. - Not so much this time. Just enough to ensure... - Don't think of me, I beg you. I do not think of you, John. I think of her. We do not yet know the extent of his hold over her. It's better she remains much as she is for the present, stronger in body and active in mind. - Oh, John! - Forgive us, Mrs. Weston. - We didn't mean to disturb you. - Oh, is she better? May I see her? Oh, you've been gone so long. She is much better Mrs. Weston, but I must ask you yo be patient. Any excitement, should you arouse her now, might well prove fatal. - Oh, John! - We must do as the Professor says. Oh but just a moment, John. It's more than I can bear! It is of Lucy we must think, my dear lady, not of our personal feelings. Forgive me, I'm not insensible of the pain I cause you, but I must, I fear, insist. You would not, you could not endanger the life of one you hold so dear? You agree with the Professor? The Professor is a man of more experience and learning than I. It seems that I can serve Lucy best by obeying him. - I shall sleep here on the couch. - No. O, you cannot deny me that! Maybe a good night's rest would... But no, no you are right. I shall not deny you that small comfort. But Mrs. Weston, I beg you, do not, as you value your child's life enter that room. Do as I say and with God's grace all will be well. Now, I must give you something to make you sleep. You must rest. You'll excuse me for a moment, sir. I'll go and see if Mrs. Weston is at home. I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs.Weston is not able to see you. She feels sure you'll understand. But men have believed throughout the ages in the existence of the undead. Certulion, Saint Augustine... Yes, yes, Certulion, Saint Augustine, what dis they know of science? No educated man of this century believes anything of that kind. No educated man supposes for one moment that Dr. Mesmer was anything but a charlatan. But you have seen for yourself that mesmerism is a reality. So, the educated man must think again. Science is based on facts. If the facts give our science delay, we cannot just ignore them. Now, I offer you facts... These I have collected with the help of Professor Reitzsler of Vienna. examine. You will find here overwhelming testimony from modern, from ancient, from sceptic, from religious, from every civilisation throughout the ages, to the existence of the undead. To the Assyrians and Babylonians he was Ekimmu. The Chinese called him Jiangshi. To the ancient Mexicans he was Xibalba. In Greece he was Vrykolakas. In the South Sea Islands, Tu. The Malayans called him Penanggalan. He is known from the wastes of Lapland to the jungles of India, where the Hindu's called him Vetala. Now read, read for yourself! Leonia Latchib, Colonia, 1746. Ziperenda Dovenzati, Naples, 1745. Augustin Calmet, Paris, 1747. You're telling me of legend and hearsay. All this happened, if it did happen, centuries ago. True, true, but not only that... In 1864 there was a severe outbreak recorded in the Cherov. In 1870, 33 deaths in Lithuania baffled conventional medicine. yet every victim bore the vampire's mark. In 1880, a remote Sicilian village was decimated. 'la strigoi Che succhiano il sangue'. And Reitzman himself is investigation a severe outbreak during the last five years in Transylvania. He has found the authorities sceptical, the natives too frightened to... John, what is it? Transylvania. - Dracula. - Dracula? Count Dracula, what of him? It was he who exerted such a profound influence over Lucy. John, I know you were disturbed by his attentions to her... Dracula comes from Transylvania. But vampires are creatures of the night. They cannot manifest themselves till after sunset... His habits, as you know, are nocturnal. Those are Dracula's own words when I questioned him about poor Harker. He and Harker travelled together from Varna, but Dracula denied ever having encountered him on board. My God, Harker called him 'Master'. He seemed subject to him in some strange way. He obeyed him instantly. But Harker's symptoms in no way correspond to Lucy's. John, not so fast. Harker is zoophagous. Under mesmerism he described a scene in which the Master, Dracula, perhaps, claimed him for his own. Active by day when the vampire is unable to leave his resting place. Harker would be the perfect agent for... Where does Dracula live? Glebe House. you'll only get one of your turns again, Madam. Like the one you had the other day. - You mark my words. - Oh don't fuss. we'll see whose fussing tomorrow morning, Madam. Oh my poor, poor child. He cannot know a mother's love to forbid me even to see her. I must see her. Just a glance so my mind is set at rest. Well, it can do no harm. That house has not been occupied during his tenancy. Where on earth does he live/ We must find his hiding place. He is powerless by daylight. We must question Harker more. In his present despair he has spoken of nothing but his desertion by the Master. He must tell us something. Abandoned. He's no use for me now. I, who was chosen to serve. I am his but to command. Cast aside. - What have I done? - Let us take you to him. - Tell us where he lives and we'll take you... - I would fly to him were I to know. What with boots and bare feet. - How does he come to you? - He comes no longer. - And when he did come? - He spoke to me... I heard his voice. I felt the thrill, the sweetness of his presence. Since you have been here, when did he first come to you? It was... What is time to him, eternal one? What is my poor stand to him, the everlasting? Tempt my servant no father. I have triumphed and I will triumph again. Pit not your puny friends against me, the mightiest and everlasting. I shall not rest till I and my chosen hold full sway over all. Triumphed? Lucy! Lucy! John, think of Mrs. Weston! My poor friend. I have no wish to add to your pain, but I fear you must see this. Oh, Lucy. A transfusion, quickly. - No John, it is too late. You said she was safe! I wanted to stay. I begged you to let me stay. She was in his mercy the moment we left. John, the garlands are broken. - What? But how? - Mrs. Weston, perhaps? Had she not a key to this room? - I don't know, she might have. - No John. No, no, think, think! Her daughter's dead. That will be grief enough for her to bear. Perhaps indeed too much. If it was she who...then she could not have known what she was doing. John, we have had tragedy enough. John? I'm here my love. Kiss me. Kiss me. - Lucy! - Too late. She is his. Professor Van Helsing's, sir. There is nothing I can say, John, and I realise that. No words. But life will go on whether we will or not, though we failed. I failed. I underestimated our adversary. Even now I am not sure I have the measure of him. Was Mrs. Weston's impulse spontaneous? I wonder. John, if Lucy's salvation is to be ensured, you must realise that now she has joined them, she is one of the legion of the undead. - I will not believe that Lucy... - That was not Lucy. That was his creature. It must be destroyed. - She is dead. - She is not dead, John. Enough of your necromancy! Lucy, whom I loved, is dead. Is that not enough? Good evening. Ask no more of me. I must. We failed to save her life. We must not fail to save her soul. I have the key of the vault. We must open it tonight. Mina... Mina... Lucy?! Sorry you're not afraid of me. I have come back to tell you I have found not rest but joy! Joy beyond understanding. Oh Mina, there's nothing for you here. Join us. You'll have dominion over all. See...I am no spirit. I am flesh transformed. Let me kiss you, my dearest. Life as you know it is pain and slow decay. Life for me is exquisite, ecstatic, everlasting. There is no pain... only desire. Desire fulfilled! Mrs. Harker? Mrs. Harker, surely you should not be alone in this place at so late an hour. Why, I have just seen Lucy. Miss Weston? That is not impossible my dear lady. I am not an unbeliever. I do not scoff. There is life beyond the grave. Life everlasting, for those who are favoured. As our dear Lucy has surely been favoured. She begged me to join her. And you are willing? What have I got to live for? Jonathan is lost to me. Lucy was my only friend. To take one's own life? You would not be required to take your own life, but to be reborn. Would you be kind enough to escort me home, Count? I'm feeling very tired. Allow me, Mrs. Harker. You will trust Lucy, come what may? Then only be patient. She will come to you again. But keep your own counsel. The elect must be forever on their guard. - John. - My bag. - Professor, I beg you. - No, John. Look! Look, John! - But how? - She must return before sunrise. We have only to wait. The authorities should be informed. - What are we waiting for? - She must return before sunrise. John...what ever you may see, what ever effect it may have on you, do not leave this spot. Leave everything to me, you understand? Leave everything to me. What is it? - Lucy? - That is not Lucy, that thing you see! - Lucy? She's alive. - John, come back! Auferetur in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti. Oh my poor friend, come. There is more to be done. We must lay her to rest forever. Come, there is nothing to fear. We must drive it through her heart. Let's hope that she be free. Believe me John, it is the only way. Here, see John, she's at peace at last. - It's over. - For Lucy, yes. But the source of this evil is still with us. - Yet you no nothing of his whereabouts/ - I've been cast off. He has abandoned me. He is no longer close at hand. He has abandoned me. - Mrs. Harker's arrived, sir. - She's in the drawing room. - Beg your pardon, sir? - She's in the drawing room. Would you mind going in the drawing room, please? At last. I came as soon as I got your message Professor. Is Jonathan...? Mrs. Harker, now do not be alarmed. We need your help. Your husband has reached a turning point in his case, and there are certain questions he must answer if we are to help him more. Now it may be that he will speak to you, his wife, more freely that he will speak to me, a stranger. At present he is in a mesmeric trance. If you would be so good as to put to him - the questions that I wish to ask. - Yes, yes, of course. Jonathan, where is the Master? Jonathan... where is the Master? Again. Where is the Master? You! Spurned, cast off...for you! For you he's turned his face from me! - No! - You have the place that should be mine! - And mine alone! - No! - See, you have his mark! - Help! The mark he withheld from me! Mrs. Harker. That mark on your throat, what caused it? - I don't know. - You must! When did it first appear? I do not know! Dracula. Was it Dracula? Your husband said you bore his mark. When did you last see Dracula? - How did he come to you and where? - I don't know! I remember nothing! You have given yourself to him. - There's no evidence of that. - That is not evidence enough? Admit that you are in his power. Admit it. We may yet be able to save you. - Woman, your very soul is in danger. - No! No, she knows eternal pain. - She? Lucy. Dearest me, Lucy. It was but a vision yet... she seemed to appear to me as if in life, to embrace me, as if in life! Embrace you. Then it was she. No. When did you last see Dracula? Answer me! Professor we can't go on. She can’t tell us anything more. No, you are right, John. She cannot aid herself, but we are not yet powerless. See that she is kept here. She must be put to bed and given a draught. Very good, sir. Master. Master, you've come back to me. Yes Master. You have only to command. Mina. It is as I thought, Dracula courts his own. We must follow. She's here, Master. She's here. Your servant hasn't failed you. - Lucy? - Lucy! She was but his play thing. She's no longer one of us. It's you the Master's chosen. John, that grave, what do you know of it? It's the grave of some poor fellow who took his own life. That is the answer. Unconsecrated ground. This then is his resting place. - Oh... - Shh! She's here, Master. See, I've brought her as you commanded. Auferetur in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti. Have pity. Have pity. What pity have you shown for those who fell beneath your sway? Everything I have I will give you... Life eternal, domination over the powers of darkness. Knowledge. The knowledge you crave for more than life itself. The knowledge which is mine and mine alone. Tempt me not. The souls that you have damned forever cry for vengeance, and will not be stilled. Come. Come.
