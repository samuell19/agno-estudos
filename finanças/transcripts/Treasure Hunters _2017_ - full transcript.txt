Subtitles by explosiveskull Dad would have picked this spot. I hope so Riley. It's our third location this year. Third and last. Bones. Bones are usually near treasure, right? It's a good sign. Seeing dead bones is never a good sign! You both need to get out more. Dad used to say that pirates will always bury the gold with the dead to scare treasure hunters away. Let's keep digging. Yes, boss. Oh! Bingo! I got it! You lost our bet Bi. Get the crowbar. Here. No, it's your you do it. - I'll mess it up. - Just, give it to me! - Wait! - What? What are you doing? Use it like a damn crowbar and open it from the side, not smash it to pieces. Right. I wish Dad was here. 40 years of his life was for this one moment. Dammit! I don't get it. It has to be here, we have to keep digging! It's not here, someone beat us to it. That's impossible! We're the first ones here. It's been almost 70 years, anything could have happened, Bi! Bi! Bi! What do we do now? Want another beer? I'm not the chief anymore. Since when? It's called inflation. So how many men can you get me for tomorrow? Five. Are they dependable? You should know me by now. That's the problem Sanchez, I know you too well. Once condition, I go too. Right. Meet tomorrow afternoon at the docks. Don't be late. You must be the pencil pusher. Terra, right? They said to expect a warm welcome. You spend much time outside? Actually, I've been camping multiple times with my family. Well this isn't going to be some camping trip with Mon and Dad. Follow behind, , got it? Hello. How much for the rope? For you 1000 pesos. 1000 pesos? You didn't charge me that much last time. The price went up this year, I have a family to feed. - Well I can't buy it then. - Wait, wait, maybe 750. 350? You got a deal. Going on! Hey, nice rope, a little expensive, 200, but definitely worth it. I should know, I got one yesterday. Come on kids, let's go! Yeah, we have some digging to do. Again! Score one more! Don't worry, I got us some more. Again. Come on baby let's do this! They're still preparing. Take the money, don't worry about it. Let's go. We shouldn't have told him about the spot Riley. I would have loved to see his face when he found potatoes. I know it was just, my anger took over and, I just wanted to make him feel bad. Okay, let's not underestimate them. Brad usually surrounds himself with pretty smart people. Sorry bro, you tell me where to dig, and I'll dig it. I don't know, you tell me the X and I'll tell you what's underneath the ground, and how we can get there. Historical sources don't say much about the exact location. But, you know, tomorrow I do, I actually have a meeting with some locals again, so that could give us more clues. Fantastic, fantastic. The job officially starts tomorrow, and we have no idea where to dig. What if that Riley girl lied to you? Nah, she wouldn't. Not when she knows the truth stinks twice as much. You are way to naive my friend. Piss off Aston! - Where are you going? - My office. I should take you both for dinner. It's been a year since you guys had. We knew you were family when we found you. I looked that desperate? You looked hungry. There aren't too many kids who have survived the streets of hell for so long. You know you can always count on me, right? Just help us find it so we can all move on, I want to start my life already. Wait, you mean you aspire to do other things besides digging and getting dirty? Does your sister know about this? I want to go to school, start a family, go to all those fancy hotels and all that, fairytale BS everyone talks about. Hey white girls! I'm talking to you American dolls. Ignore them, they're drunk. You got that! Touch me one more time! Hey, everyone cool down! All right, we don't want to hurt anyone, so this is your last chance to walk away! This is our stop! Huh! Hey, did you get any scratches? - No, you? - No. - Hey, a bike? - This is all could find. I thought had your motorcycle license? I do it, what does it have to do with the price of rice in the Philippines, now get on! Go, go! Wait here, I got this. Aw come on! You see? You scared them. I just tried to make it a fair fight! I think your Tai Chi moves were a little over the top. - Think so? - Hey if I were them, I would have ran too. Your friend, she got away and she went to the East end of the island, correct? Do you know if she saw any landmarks, from where she was at? Maybe she can point it out on the map? She's not gonna know what to do with that. Maybe she doesn't like you. Thank you! It's the same with this man every year. they keep getting greedier and greedier each time. What's he asking for this year? More than last. Whoops, I'm sorry. Good morning. I guess, it's the time of the year. You know, it is great to see old friends. Hello to you too Senator. Beautiful, how are you? How many other permit requests did you get this year? I love the woman, straight to the point... Tell me this Senator, this is your province, so did you get paid extra off of ours, and Kerri-Ann fees? Michael, Michael,. This is the last year we're doing this you know. Beautiful, and why is that? You ain't giving up already? No, we're underfunded this year. You can count on it. Hey guys, got our spot. - Show me. - She pointed it out when I took out my nav. How precise? - Pretty close. - If there's a large enough deposit of metal there, my equipment will find it. Gather the team, we have a boat to catch. What about permits? I'm sure Kerri-Anne will have the the first to find it. I got my shovel, I got my pick, I'm ready to dig! What are you gonna do with your share Aston? - Aston Martin baby! - Typical! - You? - Get out of this place. Maybe I'll buy a vineyard in the south of France. Typical. She doesn't belong here. - Jealous! - Don't be silly! I just don't trust her, nor Peter. That spot that old lady showed us, with the data I gathered. After 70 years that spot looks nothing like your map. New trees, new roots, decades of soil erosion. It's gonna take a lot of patience. Patience I have. Time we don't. For some reason, I have a good feeling about this place. Yeah, let's get going. You need help with your bag getting off? No I'm fine, it's not that heavy. Grade A boat you got us, Peter. How much longer? Why are we doing this again? It's to accept their love from the gods and blessings for safety. - Did y'all do this last year? - Yeah. We're covering all our. What are you doing? I, I, I heard the drums. Whose snitch are you? - No one! - You liar! Disgusting little liar! I just wanted some food. I'm sorry, I'm just a little stressed out right now. I'll give you some food. Hey! Hey! What's that noise? We have to keep moving. Tell me you hear that? It, sounds like drums to me. Your best friend back there is slowing us down. I don't know what he's doing. I don't think he knows where he's going. That's why Terra is there, to protect my investment. I never expected Brad to think for himself. That's why I'm paying you Peter, to give him the needed push. He's an arrogant imbecile. What do you see at the moment? Bogs. Spiders. Mosquitoes. Just stay close to him! Come on guys! Put your backs into it! Ria, you're starting to scare them. They probably never seen a woman like me before. No one's seen a woman like you before. Steel Two to Steel One! Steel Two to Steel One. I almost shot you! I would have dodged it! I've located the Cross sisters' camp. They've already started, yours? They haven't even started yet. Lost in the jungle, amateurs. This is it. Can you smell it? I smell nothing but sweat and heat, and it's not smelling too good. Kelli what do the rocks point to? Can't wait to start. Perimeters? What are they? Let's mark off a 400 square foot grid. Let the dig begin. Steel One, Steel Two come in! Steel One here. Team Two has found our act, copy. Copy that. Bones, hey! I got bones! Human for sure. Beautiful ones? No, just more bones. It's a good sign, let's keep digging. Riley, it's just one of hundreds of mass graves here. Your dad would move. But Dad never found anything, and I say we keep digging. Did you say hundreds? Should we report this grave? No, that's not our job. This whole island is a mass grave. Where the hell did you get that from? Always have something extra. Baby doll, did you ever think about what we're gonna do with all this stuff once we get 'em? Way ahead of 'ya. I got a guy on the mainland on call. My only concern, is that it doesn't sink the ship with that much weight. I love that you have a plan. Big daddy's always got a plan. [tense music You are a pretty brave little girl running through here by yourself. I know this place like the back of my hand. So listen, they've found bones. I'm sure they are resting so... Actually, they're digging throughout the night. Great. I always have a bunch of lazy diggers. You got your information, know pay up! Yes, a deal is a deal. the 600 and there is only 300 here? Hey listen, 300 is enough to buy candy for the whole lot of you! You little twerp! How did you get my number? I have my ways. What do you want? I need to ask you to do something for me. That's a good one. What makes you think I'm gonna help you? Somewhere, deep, deep deep down inside, you're still the Riley I know. Look, if you want to borrow money, I don't have any. Do I look broke to you? Kind of mean, now is not the best example but I'm doing fine. Cut to the chase, my time is money. Why does every woman I know keep saying that to me? - I'm leaving. - Wait, wait. I want you to pack up your bags and go home. We found it. Not possible. We found bones, Imperial uniforms and Japanese insignias. Why are you telling me this? I just wanted to return the favor. Tell. Face it, go home. Don't waste any more of your precious time. Did she fall for it? Hook, line and sinker. And they're not even close. Kerri-Anne sends her bests. I hope you're not stressing the poor woman. Kerri-Anne stressed? Never, she's as hard and cold as they come. Tell here we're close. Close to what, exactly? You know that smirk of yours is gonna get you kicked of my team some day. I dare you to cross me. Women say that to me all the time. You're not really my type though. He's lying! Maybe, maybe not. Riley, Dad has dug on that side of the island for years, and found nothing. We have a better system. We've eliminated all other possible dig sites. Process of elimination remember? They're on their first year Riley, first year! He's lying! But why, why would he lie to me like that? Maybe he still likes you. Where are you going? To do some spying, Michael come on! - Any news? - If there was any news I would call you right away. What's taking you so long? I'm not doing the searching. Are you Terra? I'm sorry you're breaking up! Can you hear me? See that darn... Has Kerri-Anne contacted you? No, why? About finding this thing? She can't possibly think we'd find it that quickly? I keep telling her it's going to take some time and for her to be patient. I mean, people have been searching for decades for this. There's a reason why it hasn't been found yet. I want this found as badly as you do, so I can get back to my wife and kids. I didn't know you had a family. I just want the best of everything. Would you like me to call her? No need. Oh um, Peter, I'm sorry for being rude to you earlier. I guess I deserved it. Who's that he with? Whoever they is they making out like that. Hey, Bi! I have no idea where we're at! You know this island better than me! That way! Wait wait, wait,. I can hear them! I can smell their fear! I wanna cut them real slowly,. I think it's coming from over there. We gotta find them, or our cover is blown! Sit down! You know what my father used to say? - No ma'am. - If you want to do something right, you've got to do it yourself. Uh, I don't understand Madam. Call for the limo. I'm going to the jungle! Are you sure it was him? 90%, yes, and I have no gold. He had a perimeter alarm set up, and he had a girl with him. Girl? Sounds like him. - All over... - Cut it Michael. I don't care. He could have 10 girls. Of course... Riley, you deserve better. I don't want anything to do with that liar. Good. Let's see if they have all their permits set up. You know who to call. Senator! Riley, Riley Cross. You know it's not nice to point. You're gonna regret that. Good morning everyone. Who would you be without the gun! So you know why I'm here. The gold, let's put it this way. I know who you are. You arrogant Americans, think that everything's for free here. No no no. You owe me money. You see, in this country, it is illegal to dig, without permit. And here funny boy, I have happen, to govern, this side of the town. And guess what? It is my money. Money is no issue. We could pay for the permits any time. - Our boss... - I'm the boss. I'll give you funny boy, 24 hours to get it. Or this dig, will be shut down, and I promise you, your ticket out of here will be slow and painful. Are we clear? Welcome to the Philippines. Damn Santos! Let's face it, why would they come back? Job? Money? No, y'all paying for those. So far our money was good enough. You probably got bought out. You're getting paid nothing, yet you're still here. I'm different. I believe in you. You know what? It's their loss. Let's find this damn thing! Steel Two to Steel One. Steel One here. - Third party's arrived. - Third party? Who is it? Who the hell should I know? She's some lady, she looks rich. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Is it far? Of all the people in the Philippines I end up with a mute as a guide! You are robbing me, in the middle of the fricking jungle? Gimme all you got! Why in the world would I do that? I'll just kill you myself and take it! I can have you hunted down, maimed, and beaten until the pigs if I wanted too! Now let's go, you have wasted my time already! You can't leave a robbery. Even in the jungle someone tries to rob you! What's happening to this world today? If anyone has any money... Now, give me your necklace, your earrings, your jewelry. We got something. Huh? What the hell are we waiting for. It's probably empty, let's just say what another disappointment. Crowbar! What? We'd better call for Riley. That really it? We did it! I knew it! I wonder how much is here? It's more then we can carry out for sure. We are so rich! Keep it down! We don't want any company now! What do we do now? Just as planned. Get the first load out, split, and meet at the docks. Well, I'm gonna cover the hole up, and I'm gonna clean this place up. - All right. - All right, Ri, you go with me, and Michael you take Bi, and use the south dock to spread the risk. All right. - And then... - And then, we'll start our lives! Tired? - No I'm fine. - Here,. Yeah man, gimme the bags! Easy my man, easy, easy! All right? Yeah easy! Just take off your bag, take off your bag, it's all right, it's all right. Here we go. Open 'em! Got you now! Enough, game's over! Get off me! Oh! - Ri! - A snake bit me! A snake, a snake bit me! - What kind of snake? - I don't know! All right, we have antivenom. Ri, Ri! She packed the antivenom, right? Yeah I got some there, , hurry up! - It's not in here. - What? I don't, I don't know... You know how this works right? I gotta go get antivenom. - No! - I'll be back! No... Ri! I'll be back! Hurry up! You're not getting away with this! If I had a dollar, for every time someone said that to me , I'd be in Fortune 500! Oh, oh... Oh it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Oh yeah. Come on baby, we got a boat to catch! So long suckers! Y'all can't leave us like this! We just did! There was no shorter way? I start to think you're a rank incompetent like the rest of the people I need to work with! Oh my God! Jackpot! Go find me Brian and Peter and bring them to the dock! And hurry up! Now it's your turn. Hey guys, I'm gonna go visit that old lady again, and this time she's gonna tell me the truth. Okay. Hey Kelli go with her, for protection. Sure. Now, where did he find it? Wherever he found it, there must be a lot left over. So this is what people have wars - over. - Don't get used to it! Put it down! You know what I'm not gonna take this shit anymore! Peter stop! Save the gold! What about your right-hand man? Stop the boat! Get off of this! All of you get off the boat now! What are you doing Peter? Make me go over there and get you. Get off now or I'm gonna shoot you! I won't repeat myself again! You're making a big mistake. They're not needed anymore, I will get you the rest of it! Now! You idiot, how are we gonna carry that ourselves? How far is the nearest land? We have no chance. - So we're screwed? - Yeah. You want to bet who can reach shore first? Are you quick bud? So the red is connected to the battery, then this, goes here. What are you doing Peter, fix it, fix it now! Hold your breath, you're gonna need it in about two minutes. This boat is not fixable. There's no. Don't you dare leave me here! What are you doing? I can't swim! Get back here now, that's an order! How did you do it by the way? Yeah right old man. I got it, I got it Ri! I'm so sorry. Sorry Ri. Not now kids! Still waiting for my money! He has the gold! You little rodent! I can share it, I-I can share it! I can share it! I can share it! I've already told you all that I know. But there's nothing there. Terra take out your map, have her point it out to you again. Please, show us again. Are you sure, because, that's miles away from where you showed us last time? - Yes. - Why are you misleading us? Please leave now, I have told you what I remember. Listen, we're not leaving here until you tell us the truth. - Leave now. - You're lying to us. What's happening? Senator Mendoza, you've got to leave immediately! This is not good! Oh my god! , you gave us, the wrong spot again. I gave you all what you wanted to hear. So, you think, I like to be running around with my mens, digging holes? What do you want from me? I'm telling you all the things I told to everyone else. Nothing has changed in the past 70 years. Mother, Mother! I didn't want it to come to this, but, you know, if I have to, I will. Please, leave him! He doesn't know anything! So, where is it? Well then, you leave me no choice then. Run! American ladies! Boys, kill them! Damn this crazy lady. Boys, get them! - I think we lost them. - We need to keep mov... This way, fast! Crazy American ladies, they're gonna pay for it. Grab, grab what you can and get more. Can't you just call Brad? He's not gonna make it on time! I'm a historian Kelli I don't bash people in the heads! Well that's too bad, it's just not gonna help you right now is it? - Can't we just lose them? - You'll be dead before you open your mouth! I'm gonna hit the gun out of his hand, you aim for the head, got it? Terra listen to me, if you want to live, you'll do as I say. Get ready! Terra, we've gotta run! Oh really ladies? This is a house of God! Come on! Just surrender now, and I promise you, I won't hurt you. We can talk, this out, like civilized people. On my way. Boys, don't let these American ladies, get out of here alive. Kill them. Sorry God. Bi you okay? Listen, do you have anything in your pockets that we can use to get out of here? I can't even understand you anyway. Give me a second, let me check my pockets real quick. Shit! It's not working. I'm sorry Bi, I let 'em get away. I was just trying to be the superhero and save the day but, it got us in a big mess now. You can only go maybe three or four days without water, after that we dead. That's unless the jungle eats us first. Just in case we don't make it out of here, there's something I want to tell you. I just wanna let you know, that I'm doing this all for you. And also, , before your father passed away, I asked him for his permission, to ask... Damn! Can you let a man finish! They took all my knives. We can buy you some more when we get out of here. It's so close. They took my damn 22! That was an antique from Brazil. Momma they're gonna regret that. Let's just get these handcuffs off first. Yeah baby. What the hell? Your gold? Gone! Right now I have bigger problems! My sister never left the island. Well what did you guys think about going? Back to base camp? - Where is that? - Why would I tell you that? Sooner or later I'm gonna find your dig site. I have time. And right now Bibi doesn't. - I don't trust you. - Good, I don't trust you either. But you need my help. I don't need anything from you! What's more important? Your sister's safety, or the gold? Aston! Thank goodness you're here! Where did you guys disappear to? Senator Mendoza and all of his men have been looking for us. We saw something we weren't supposed to see. I don't know, I just think this girl might be , so history just keeps repeating itself? What do you want me to do with that? Use this if you have to, and get out of here. I'm not leaving without you and Brad! We'll be fine! If we don't get out of here now, they'll never let us leave. Let's go! Great. Well. This is good to see, you two together again! Senator, what are you doing here? Oh, let me explain. I'm checking, to make sure, you're safe. We're doing fine. Well, what about all your mens? - They bailed on me. - Seems, like not much has changed. But, at least, you got funny boy back. Anything else we can do for you Senator? I wouldn't waste any more of the taxpayer's money. I can tell you're a very busy man. Well, let me refresh your memory. You owe me, a permit. No, we're leaving! There's no permit necessary, there's no gold on this island. Well, what we got here! Where's Ria? Beautiful, what about you two? Are you quitting too? Never! We'll be back next year. It's just a matter of time till we find it. No! We're leaving! Come on. Good to see you guys! This is my Philippines. Come on boys! Ha, shit! You forgot to check if it had fuel in it before you stole it? Classic. What are we gonna do now? Kendra, no need to worry, big daddy's always got a plan!
