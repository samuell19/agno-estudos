-You're late! -Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I had an audition. Anyway, my name's Bob. I'll be your driver. Can I get that for you? Los Angeles International Airport. Yes, sir. Asshole. [yawns] ♪ I'm drinkin' with the devil ♪ ♪ In his funky, gory hell ♪ ♪ I'm chillin' With the devil-- ♪ [radio stops] [honking] Can't you go around him? No, I can't. It's your funeral. [gunshot] [whirring] [glass shatters] [man] No. No. No. No. Yes. [laser whirring] Nah, too small. Hmm... [woman] Police Department. Yes. Good evening. I'd like to report a burglary. [spray hissing] [woman] 119, we have a report of someone identifying himself as a cat burglar at the LA Jewelry Center. [cop] This is 119. We're on it. Police. Open up. Come on, come on. Open up. How do I know you're really the police? 'Cause if I wasn't the police, you'd be dead right now. [Danitra] Let's go! Come on! -Come on, come on. -Let's go. California Diamond Corporation. What floor? I... Um... What floor? Eleven. What's going on? You're bein' robbed. I didn't hear no alarm. [tapping] Go up the stairs? Uh-uh. I ain't chasing after nobody in these platform shoes. I'm stayin' right here. Yo... You peed yourself. Freeze. Dave? Peter. Dave, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? I asked you first. I got a call about a cat burglar. What are you doing here? Nothin'. No... So, uh, Dave, how you been? But you're supposed to be in jail. I got out early for good behavior. Well, guess what? You're goin' back. Dave, you don't understand. You see, I-- Whoa! [screaming] [thuds] Ha! Faked you out! I'm gonna kill you. Dave, you wouldn't shoot your own brother, would ya? [gunshot] You're crazy! [gunshot] That's right. I went crazy. I shot my own twin brother. Probably go to jail for it. You know somethin'? I don't care. At least I won't have to... Deal with you. [clicking] You're out of bullets. I can see you're having a bad night. Later, brother. [grunts angrily] [clacks] Uh..."D." This is an accurate account of your statement. Sign your name at the bottom. If it isn't, too bad. I ain't typin' no more. Okay! All right, Charlie. I told you I'd meet you in about an hour. Yeah. [speaks indistinctly] Okay, look. I gotta go. All right. What's this? It's a present. Open it. We, uh... We heard you were chasin' after some "cat burglar." [laughing] That's funny. That's very funny. Maybe you should keep it, Albers. I mean, that's the only kind of pussy you'll ever see. [laughing] Nobody in here has any work to do? So now you wanna tell me what really went down? Read the report. "A seven foot Chinese male with blond hair." Please. It was dark. I couldn't get a good look at him. Why are you doggin' me? You gonna hold out on your partner? Danitra, I was gonna... What are you lookin' at? Nothin'. Get outta here. Listen, why don't you go, too? Nah, I'm all right. No, really, go. Go on. Blow off some steam. Go lift some weights and give yourself a hernia. What about you? I gotta meet somebody. Who? Maybe that's not really any of your business. Danitra. This guy I busted when I was workin' down in South Central. He's been clean a couple years working construction. Says he knows somethin' about somethin'. It's probably nothing. It's okay. Go. Take off. I'll be fine. But if it looks like anything, anything at all, I want you to call me. Yes, Mommy. I'm serious. And when you're serious, you are really very cute. What are you gonna do with him? Here. Uh-uh, don't give me no bad luck. I'm outta here. Peace. [meows] [growls] [meows] Use the sink. [exhales] [exhales deeply] [inhales] [grunts] Aah! [grunting continues] [loud grunting] [grunting continues] [inhales] [exhales] How am I doin', coach? I enjoy training you. And I enjoy being trained. What happened to your arm? My brother shot me. Why'd he do that? I don't know. Maybe because I got a bicycle and he got a BB gun. What? It's a long story. When am I going to meet this mysterious brother? -He sounds interesting. -You wouldn't like him. He's real skinny. He's got puny arms, and little spindly legs. He could barely walk without his crutches. Peter, do you ever tell the truth? Not if I can help it. Watch this. I take a piece of coal and... [straining] Ta-da! Wow! Is it real? It better be after what I went through to get it. Take a look through this. Oh, Peter, it's fantastic. [Peter] See how clear it is? Yeah. The color is almost transparent. That means it's a good diamond. It's beautiful. -What are you doing? -Oops! I dropped it. Peter. It's all right. I'll find it. [giggling] [Danitra] Ow! [grunts] Okay, Charlie, let's make this quick. It's been a long night and my feet are killing me! So what's up? What you gotta tell me? Oh, Charlie, I thought you were straight, man. [grunts] [gunshot] [indistinct chatter] [Captain] Security guard found them around 5:30 this morning. She was shot once in the back of the head, point-blank. Approximately 15 to 20 grams of heroin were found in her purse. She was clean. I know. But there will still have to be an investigation. The overdose worked for Kent Construction. Name's Charles Vasquez. Did you know him? He called Danny to set up the meeting. Why? If I knew why, she wouldn't be dead. They killed... They killed my baby. I'll get him man, I'll get him. [Albers] The two most important things are-- Get the bullet over to Ballistics immediately, and I'd like to see a copy of that blood panel. Who knows? Maybe she was dirty. [grunts in pain] [music plays on videotape] [turns off tape] Apparently, there's been a breach in security, Ellis. Now who do you suppose it was? It must've been Donald. Yes. Must've been Donald. Tucked away there, safely in prison, lifting his weights, and discussing my security system with every convict he takes a long shower with. We could get somebody inside. It's a little late for that now, don't you think? Ellis? And since you're head of security, I'm afraid I have to hold you accountable. Bob. Tito... You're new head of security. Jeremy, I'll need to have lunch with Mr. Kent. And let's make sure he doesn't have anymore nervous employees like Mr. Vasquez, who need to make calls to the police department. Tito, I know I don't have to tell you what to do. [chuckling] Yeah, but I will. I want you to track down our little intruder. And get that fucking card back! [woman] Police Department. Good evening. I'd like to report a burglary. Address? California Jewelry Mart. -California Jewelry Mart. -That's right. Your name, sir? Oh. And could you please send that nice detective Jade? -Who is this? -Thank you! Who is this? Sir? Hello-- [chuckling] Teach you to shoot at me. [crackling] [grunts] Whoa! [siren] I didn't do it. You have the right to remain silent. As a matter of fact, I insist on it. Come on, man. This isn't funny! It is where I'm standin'. David, I said I was sorry! All right, all right. Wait a minute. Come here. Okay. How much do you want? -You tryin' to bribe me? -Naturally. Forget it, asswipe. You got all the bad chromosomes, not me. I'll see you in 20 years. David! You better let me out of here Or I swear I'll get you for this. Oh, oh! You'll get me? Take a look around you. You see all these guys? They don't like me very much. You know why? 'Cause I put every one of their asses in here. [whistles] Yo, hey, everybody! This is my brother. David! David! David! [siren wails] [Sinclair] Detective Jade. Detective Jade. Yeah. What's this? The financial report on Charles Vasquez. Right. He was pulling down some serious cash for a construction worker. It looks like he was doing some moonlighting. Thanks, Sinclair. No problem. How about buying some cookies from my kid? Jade, Chief's Office. Wait a sec. No "just a sec." Now. Sorry. Detective Jade, this is Steven Tarlow from the District Attorney's office and Agent Regan from the FBI. Hi. Nice to meet you. You'll have to excuse my voice. I've been screaming at assholes all morning. But before we get into this, I just wanted to say that I was sorry to hear about your partner. The entire department grieves for her husband and family. But Detective Jade, you assaulted a fellow officer and put Lieutenant Albers in the hospital. Now, what do you have to say about that? I should've put him in the morgue. You know damn well that that shit doesn't go very far with me! You're a good cop, Jade, but you've got to learn to control your temper! This is the last episode I want to hear about you. Am I making myself clear? Yes, sir. Chief, may we please? All right. I knew this wasn't going to be easy for you, so I wanted to be here to introduce you to your new partner. What's he doin' here? This is your new partner. No way! Yes way! Suspect's legal counsel has convinced the DA's office that your brother may have evidence which will assist us in a federal prosecution. -No way! -Yes way! The suspect's been given immunity for the burglaries providing he can produce the evidence which will aid in the conviction of an alleged money-launderer. No way! Yes way! You are to accompany the suspect and retrieve the evidence in question. Gotcha. Wait a second. I can't believe you guys bought this bullshit. Can't you see he's lying? He'll say anything to keep from going to jail. Um, objection, Your Honor. I know this guy! You can't trust him. He'll try to get away. That's why we're sending Agent Regan along with you. Look forward to workin' with you, Dave. Oh, forget it. Get yourself a new boy. I ain't doin' it. Jade, this is not an elective assignment. Why me? Yeah, why him? Believe me, you were not my first choice. You put my first choice in the hospital. I'm sorry, but I ain't doin' it. Detective, need I remind you? You work for me. Not anymore. I quit. See, I told you he was a quitter. After you, partner. Hey, how're you doing? I'm Peter. Oh, I'm Whitney. -Whitney. Like Whitney Houston? -Yeah. Oh, what a geek! Hey, I gotta pee. Whitney, go with him. Hey, I'm just goin' to the bathroom. Whitney, go with him. Don't mind if I do. [zipper zips] Excuse me, Whitney, but I'm kinda pee-shy. Come on, little fella. Yep, I really gotta pee like a race horse. Ahh... So, Whitney where ya from? Uh, originally from Philadelphia. We moved to Connecticut after dad retired from banking. Oh, yeah. Tell me a little bit about your family. Well, uh... I'm English on my mom's side. Irish on my dad's side. Which makes me, uh... English-Irish. Goin' somewhere? Just, uh, testing the waters. They're cold and deep. Do you want to drown? Get back up there. And then there's Trisha, that's my youngest sister. She just had her debutante's ball. And then there's my older sister, Elaine. I tell ya, she is one hell of a tennis player. You'd never know that one of her legs is shorter than the other. Ah, shit. My folks got her these specially made tennis shoes with the sole about an inch thicker on the left side... [toilet flushing] Or was it the right side? You all set? No matter how much you shake it, the last drop always goes down your leg. So who is this money-launderer, anyway? His name is Philip Chamberlain. He owns the diamond company your brother inadvertently broke into. Inadvertently? Yeah, it means "unintentionally." We believe Chamberlain is using the diamond company to transfer drug money out of the country. So why don't you just go bust his ass? It's not that easy. He's got a shining public image, he's politically well-connected, heavy contributor, Board of Directors for the children's hospital, I tell you, until your brother decided to cooperate, we really didn't have much to go on. Well, I thought it was my civic duty. Okay, George Washington, where's the evidence? Chill, bro, we'll get to it. But first I gotta stop off at my house and change clothes. I smell like a jail cell. Might as well get used to it. You know, you two really do look alike. -Shut up, Whitney! -Shut up, Whitney! [girls] Hi, Peter! Hi, ladies. Oh. Uh, this is my brother, and, um, my sister. [girls laugh] [Whitney] Wow, you live here? [Peter] Only during bikini season. I guess crime does pay. Come over to the dark side, Luke. Why don't you stick it in your dark side. Oh, just a sec. Maid's day off? What a shame. This was a museum-quality piece. I ought to know, I stole it from a museum. [vase breaks] Whatever you took from these guys they want back awful bad. All this over a couple of lousy diamonds. Can you believe it? No, I can't. So you wanna tell me what's goin' on? [Whitney] The rest of the premises are secure. Thanks, Whitney. I feel safer knowing that you're here. So, uh... You guys hungry? Can I fix you some coffee and donuts? Get dressed. [Whitney] Whoa! You've got more machines here than my gym. [Peter] Want 'em? I don't use 'em anymore. Too much work. I use this thing now. -Check it out... -[spits] It's called "passive muscle stimulation." The machine sends an electrical impulse to the muscle tissue, causing an involuntary reflex. -[crackles] -Ow! That hurt! I had it amped up a little bit. Always lookin' for a way to get out of doing any work. That's what separates us humans from the rest of you in the animal kingdom. Let's go. I need my shoes! Whitney, get his shoes. I wanna pick 'em out! Whitney, get his shoes. But I don't trust his taste. Brown Italian loafers with double tassels. Okay. [grunts] Start talkin' or start bleedin'. And do what he says. Those steroids make him unpredictable. See what I mean? I don't take any steroids, and I don't take any shit! Are you always this macho? Let's hear it. I said let's hear it! Hey, Dave, why not let the machine do the work for you? Who sent you? [crackling] [screaming] [screaming] Tito. Tito? Know anyone named Tito? [crackling] [screaming] I don't know his last name! Where can I find Tito? [crackling intensifies] [screaming] Grand Promenade. He's up at the penthouse. [grunts in pain] Better not be lyin' to me, 'cause I'm comin' back! [groaning] What about Whitney? What about him? [door closes] Stop! The g-forces are killing me! Well, they'll never hear us coming in the stealth car! What have you got in this thing, a tractor engine or something? Why don't we take my car? Because you probably stole it. I did not steal it. I paid for it with some hard-earned money that I stole. So, after all that time in prison, you didn't learn nothin'? I learned where those diamonds were, didn't I? Dave, you just passed it. Grab the wheel a second, will ya? [tires squealing] Hey, what is this? You're stayin' here. Come on, man, I thought we were partners. Let's get one thing straight. You are not my partner. [sighs] [desk clerk] Hello, Mrs. Larson. Good day. Hi. Press "P," please. The penthouse is locked. You'll have to go back downstairs and ask the guard to call the tenant. After you've been announced, the guard will open the floor with the pass key. [sighs loudly] Thank you. [grunts] You stole my steering wheel? Here. You can have it back. Still mad? How'd you get the pass key? From the guard. [knocking on door] It's the guard from downstairs. Give him a hundred bucks and get rid of him. Knock-knock. Freeze! Bring the car around! David! You're welcome. [screaming] Dave, the suspects are getting away. [yelling] Get the money! [screaming] [grunts] Cool! [screaming] Who is that! Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go! [whistling] [tires squealing] Aw, come on Dave, cheer up. There'll be other bad guys. Shut up. It's all your fault. Why is it my fault? 'Cause if you hadn't taken the steering wheel, they wouldn't have gotten away. Hey, it's 411... If I hadn't clubbed that guy with the steering wheel, you'd be in the ghost police. Yeah. But I wouldn't have been there in the first place, if you hadn't stolen those diamonds! I wouldn't have never stolen anything in the first place, if you hadn't been such a goody two-shoes! What the hell are you talking about? Oh. "David did his homework, and David made his bed. Isn't David a darling? Peter, why can't you be more like your brother David? David, David, David, David!" I'm talkin' about you, the boy scout of the decade! So you're sayin' it's my fault you're a criminal? Well, that's one theory I have. The other one has to do with the breastfeeding. Hey, check it out. Souvenir from Tito's place. What is it? A blasting cap, A detonating device used by construction workers. Construction worker. Yeah, or some criminal element that wanted to set off a larger explosion. They're pretty harmless by themselves. [whistling] [Peter] okay, buddy, now it's time to play round two of "shock the monkey." You know, I've always been afraid to try this thing on myself. But I'm curious to find out if it can make your dick muscles bigger. Shit! He's alive. I better call the police. You're not calling anybody. You're going to tell me what these people are after, and I don't want to hear anymore bullshit about diamonds either. Dave, I swear to you, man, that's all I took. Hey, you were right all along. I made up all that junk about evidence just so I could stay out of jail. You are a hell of a cop. And you're a hell of a liar. You're gonna tell me the truth or I'm gonna kick your ass. Did you say you're gonna kick my ass? Sorry, can't touch this. [grunts in pain] Sorry, little brother, but I warned ya. [screaming] [tires squeal] Slow down! There's two huge men wrestling in the back seat of our car! Ah, shut up. [woman] Hey, Peter. Hi, how you doin'? [both growling] -[woman screaming] -[glass breaking] [laughing] You hungry? Starved. Let's get somethin' to eat. Don't you ever swallow? So, uh, whatever became of the straight-A student? Why'd you drop out? Someone had to work. Dad couldn't, and you were in jail. That's all right. He wouldn't have remembered you anyway. What's the name of that thing he had? "Old-timers?" Alzheimer's. Yeah, yeah. He turned into, like, Ronald Reagan, you know. He couldn't remember anything. Then one day, I guess, uh... He couldn't remember to wake up. Why aren't you eating? I thought you were hungry. Are you kidding? I can't eat that junk! It's full of carcinogens. You should ask for them on the side. Come on! Let's hose you down and go get something edible. Wait a minute. I'm not finished yet. I'm not finished yet! Come on, will ya? -I hate this. -What's your problem? It reminds me of kindergarten. I hated wearing the same clothes. They're not the same. There's a very fine pinstripe going through it. Oh, yeah, they're much different. Look, when we get outside, you can roll around in the mud, and you'll feel better. Now, will you shut up? You look great. No, I don't. I look like you. -[kissing] -Gentlemen, this way, please. There you go. Enjoy. Pick up your menu. It's in French. I'm not impressed. Pick up your menu. Now, look across the room. See the guy over there in the gray suit? That's your boy. Chamberlain? How'd you know he'd be here? Because he eats here every day. You don't think I just break into people's safes without finding out who owns them first, do you? Who's the guy he's with? Looks like those Patty Duke pills just kicked in. Okay, I give up. Which one of you adores a minuet? Son of a bitch! What are we gonna do? First place... [chuckling] We are not going to panic. Second, I want your men ready to engage at any moment. It's a 31-hour plane trip between Los Angeles and Johannesburg, including a four-hour layover in Geneva. This means that Mr. Roselyn will not be officially reported missing for another eight hours when his plane lands in South Africa without him. Now, barring the miracle of a plane crash, this leaves us eight hours in which to retrieve the card and execute the operation. If, however, at the end of the seventh hour, the card is still absent, you and your men will proceed without it. It's too dangerous. Life is dangerous, Mr. Kent. You could walk out onto this street this very afternoon and, suddenly, be struck by a speeding car. I don't like it. Stewart's not gonna like it either. Mr. Kent, I've spent several years and several millions planning this venture, and I'm not about to let anything or anyone impair it. So I suggest, that you have a little talk with Mr. Stewart, before I do. It would be, too, tragic if you were both struck by the same speeding car. [Peter] Okay, so now we know where Tito gets his blasting caps, but, uh, shouldn't we be following Chamberlain? -No. -May I ask you why? A construction worker named Vasquez set up a meeting with my partner to tell her something got them both killed. Vasquez worked for Kent. So you think Kent had something to do with it? Shit rolls downhill. Let's see where it rolls next. Good afternoon, Mr. Kent. Excuse me, sir. This is a private club. Police. Excuse me, did I just go in there? Thanks. We've got trouble. [inaudible conversation] Son of a bitch! -You know him? -Yeah, I voted for him. North district City Councilman, Leonard Stewart. Oh, I see you voted the scumbag party. Yeah, politicians are nice people. Everybody should own one. Looks like your councilman's close to the edge. Yeah. Let's push him over. Hey! What's goin' on? Let me outta here. Relax, councilman. You've still got some skin left. Who is it? What do you want? This is a warning, councilman. I know you're dirty, and I'm on to you. You lunatic, let me outta here. We know all about you and Kent and Chamberlain. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. No? Well you better get used to the heat, councilman, 'cause your ass is gonna fry. Ah! [maniacal laughter] Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! -Think that did it? -Not quite. Help! Help! Help! [indistinct chatter] Think that did it? Not quite. Got a possible bomb threat. Which one is Councilman Stewart's car? [keys clacking] It's a BMW, license number 2SAM564. Excuse me, which way did I go? Thanks. That did it. Always does. I don't know who they are, and I don't care! I said I want out! Just a moment, Leonard. Tito. You're fired. [gunshot] I'm sorry, you were saying? I said I want out. I want my goddamn money, and I want out! Calm down, Leonard. No, I'm not gonna fucking calm down, Leonard! You asked me to get Kent the goddamn contract, and I got him the goddamn contract. Now, I want my money, and I want out! All right, Leonard, all right. Anything you say. We'll come and get you. There's nothing worse than a crooked politician. Bob, the councilman needs a ride. Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm. Couldn't wait to get that raggedy old sweatshirt back on, could you? Nope. Know something? I'm really beginning to enjoy police work. No, no, really. I really think I could get into this as an alternative occupation. It's sorta fun. So, uh, what kind of money you guys make? Starting pay around $23,000. A week? A year. You let people shoot you for that kind of money? That's right. What kind of money does a brain surgeon make? Or maybe a gynecologist. Now, that wouldn't be such a bad job, would it? Have your nose buried in your work. [tires squealing] Hey! Hey! Shit! [engine revving] [screaming] Get an ambulance to Hope and Figueroa. Now! Hey, look out! [screaming] [sirens wailing] [policeman] Move it, move it! Let's go! Pull back, please, ma'am. Please. That's the guy. That's the guy. He's the one that said there was a bomb threat. [man] All right. Let's talk to him. Okay, what's going on? That's the guy, and there was another one just like him. Here you are, Peter. -Thank you. -You're welcome. What do you mean he got away? I came back to the car, he was gone. And where were you when all this was going on? I was, uh...I... He was guarding a possible suspect. The guy with his throat slit. Nice work. Agent Regan, you're off the case! Yeah, I kinda figured that. Put out an APB On Peter Jade. This was a stupid idea in the first place. No shit! Geez, I'm really sorry, Dave. Don't worry about it, Whitney. There'll be other bad guys. Come on, I'll give you a ride home. [Sinclair] Detective Jade! Here's that report you wanted. You were right. Chamberlain made some heavy-duty contributions to Stewart's campaign. I still don't get how Kent Construction ties into this. Good question. Thanks, Sinclair, I owe you one. Then how 'bout buying some cookies? Oh, yeah! You got any of those mint ones! Sure do! Son of a bitch stole my wallet! Detective Jade. David Jade, here to question one of the prisoners. Thank you for your cooperation. [prisoner] Yo, nice sport suit. Hey, Mr. C, how you doin'? I'm doing fine, Peter. Good to see you. So, what, you miss prison that bad? No way. I just came to pay homage to the master. If it wasn't for you, I'd still be boostin' car radios. You taught me everything I know. Except how to bullshit. And you, Peter, are the master of that. So what's goin' on? Where'd you get that? Uh, I found it. Now can you tell me what I found? Depository card. It accesses a Hymrick polycast vault. A beautiful, beautiful tomb. Only three of them ever made. One for the French Consulate in Washington, and one for the late, great Shah of Iran. And the last, right here, in sunny Southern California at the IDE. International Diamond Exchange. Yep. On any given day, that little card will get you, maybe $5 billion in diamonds. Billion, with a "B"! [chuckling] Hang on, Peter. Don't come too quick. It's not gonna do you any good. Why not? Well, think about it, Diamonds are an international currency. So in that exchange you got fellas from Japan, India, South Africa. Thirty-five board members from all over the world. Each one of them's got a card like that. Now, just suppose that some muscle-bound idiot happens to find one of those cards? What's to prevent him from just walking in there and cleaning the place out? Another vault. You always were my best student. Yeah, Hyler is sittin' pretty behind 16 feet of concrete and steel with a magnetic time lock set to open only during business hours with plenty of armed guards around. Keep the undesirables away. Like you and me. No way. If you were accidentally locked inside, it would take a construction crew half the night to blast you out. You might as well try to break into Fort Knox. Did you say a construction crew? Miller time! [Chamberlain] Thank you. You've made my life so much easier. [cracking] If you'll give me the card back, I'll let you keep all the diamonds, which you also stole from me. You got the wrong guy. Isn't this you? That's my twin brother. [chuckling] I like that. [chuckles] Humor in the face of adversity. I like that. Bob. Ever since I was a child, I've always gotten exactly what I wanted. Yet one way or another, things always seem to end up in my favor. At this point, I do not know how I would react to being disappointed. Bob. Either you are going to run out of blood, Or I am going to run out of patience. Or maybe both. I don't know. Where's the card? You got the wrong guy. Oh, fuck it. This is becoming a bore. [Peter] Freeze. Drop it. It looks like I owe you an apology. I said drop it. No. [gun cocks] You drop it. Kill him. Got it. Good. Now I'm happy again. What about the rest of the money? Oh, leave it. It's still traceable. Besides, we don't need it anymore. Getting out of the money-laundering business? It's served its purpose. Like financing a hit on the diamond exchange? Ooh... And who said bodybuilders were big and dumb? [door slams] We're ready. Ah. Mr. Kent. [chuckles] Here is the card. Please. Don't lose it. Jeremy? Get the plane ready. Gentlemen, I want to thank you for making this a most memorable day. Bob. Let's... go for a ride. I can tell you're mad at me. Come on, Dave, I don't wanna die knowing you're mad at me. Why'd you run away? They were after me. I didn't want to get you killed. Thanks a lot. That was very considerate of you. Okay. Well, then, maybe I was just getting sick and tired of saving your ass! Do me a favor, shoot me first, so I don't have to listen to this idiot anymore. Unbelievable. -Who you callin' an idiot? -Don't shove me. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it? I'll show you, what I'm gonna do about it. Ooh! [grunts in pain] Love my job. [gun cocks] [screams] No! Whitney! You all right? I got tired of waiting in the car. Yeah, I'm all right. Thanks. Whitney, you are awesome, man! Thanks, Peter. Listen, you better call the feds. Tell them to get their asses down to the diamond exchange, pronto. Right on! What a dick. Really. [siren wailing] This is unit 4. We are in place at the rear of the building. [man over radio] Unit 2, the roof is secure. This is unit 1. We've got it tied up out front. There's no way they're gonna get in here. I own this building. [tires squealing] Come on, man.
