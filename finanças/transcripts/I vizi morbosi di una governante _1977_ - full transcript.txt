Who is it? - It's me, Dad. - You should be home already. I had a layover in Bombay. Some trouble with the engine, you know. - How are you? - Well, it's been a long journey. Stop wasting time and come home. Yes, I'm coming tomorrow with Elsa, Frank and a few other friends. - Nonsense! We can't have guests! - Don't get so worked up. - I don't want any strangers in my house, Ileana! - Just for the weekend. - It's dangerous! - Relax, everything will be fine. No, I won't calm down! I don't want any strangers here! It's too late now, I've already invited them. Dad? Hello? Hello? Dad? Hello? CRAZY DESIRES OF A MURDERER - Hello, Bobby. - Pierluigi? - Yeah, it's me. How are you? - I was waiting for your phone call. I wanted to be sure first. What about our stuff? With the blonde, as planned. - How much? - 200 pieces. Pure. That fine for you? Good job, well done. - Don't waste time and go pick up Ileana. - Where shall we meet? - I'm coming with Frank and Gretel. See you at the motel. - See you later. Out of the car. - Relax, guys. There's no need to get worked up. - Why should we believe you? - We've waited for too long. - Easy. You'll have your stuff for Monday. - 48 hours? That's too long. - I can't get it before then! Stop trying to play it wise. You've got 48 hours but not a minute more. Get it, you two-bit playboy? - Yes. - Try to make a run for it and I'll follow you to hell. I'll shoot you between the eyes, get it? - Come in. - Welcome back, Miss. Good morning, Hans. At last we're here! - Nice place! - Look at this old manor! - Not bad! - Looks huge! - Welcome back. I'm happy to see you. - Thank you, Berta. How's life? Oh, the usual routine, especially for an old spinster like me. - How's my father? - I just gave him an injection. - He's still in pain, but calmer. - I hope so. - A transition period, in my opinion. - That's right. - Come on, let's go. - Right behind you. - Hello, you old grump. - Hello, did you have a good time? Yes, Dad. Very. A girl like you traveling alone around the world... It's simply inconceivable! Those people are savages. I remember the Boxer Rebellion. How many of those Chinese we killed. - Yes, you've told me before. - A girl like you shouldn't travel the world alone. - Please, Dad, not this again. - How are you, Baron? Fellows, allow me to introduce you to Baron De Chablais. One of the world's leading experts in Oriental art. It's Frank, Dad. You've met him many times before. You've practically watched him grow up! He's the son of your friend, Hoffman. Hoffman? Why, how's your father? - My father? - He's dead. - Dead? - More than ten years ago. Oh, that poor man. I'm shattered. - I didn't know he died. - Yes you did, Dad. You even gave the eulogy at his funeral. Yes, I remember. One beautiful funeral. If you say so, Dad. Let me introduce you my friends. Gretel Schanz. Pierluigi La Rocca. Bobby Jelson. And, for the twentieth time, let me introduce you to Elsa. Elsa Letter. I may be a wanderer but I never forget to buy Dad some knick-knacks. Knick-knacks? Why, I love Oriental art! Dad, look. I got these in some little shop in Hong Kong. I couldn't visit Mainland China, though. They keep babbling about opening to the West but no way they issued me a permit. I could see Formosa, at least. - How did you get it through customs? - The power of money, Dad. - And Bobby's help. - My cousin works at the American embassy in Formosa. - You traveled with my daughter? - We met three clays before she left for Europe. I acted as her guide, I could say. The East has no secrets for me. Then you must know that famous Chinese antiquarian. No, actually I'm more versed when it comes to nightlife. Young people used to love art in my day! That's how you learn about the world! Only a few can learn from art, whereas many from having fun. - Something wrong? - I was just admiring this collection. - Quite valuable, I imagine. - Yes, but we have much better things here. Keep your hands off me. What's wrong, Berta? You may have used me once, but I'm not your slave. Don't ever think about it. I'm over that. Time healed your wounds, I see. - It was kinder than you ever were. - My, you still thinking about that loan? Those were all my savings. - I'll pay you back as soon as possible. - I've been waiting more than two years. That blonde fell for our bait. It was easier than I expected. She's got no idea she traveled with all that stuff! - It's already been opened. - Well, I wanted a little taste. What about next time? Oh, I'll just find another courier. Plenty of pretty girls returning to Europe down there. And quick to fall for your charms. I'll write you a check. We agreed on cash. - I hope you're not writing me a bad check. - That'|| become good by Tuesday morning. - Tuesday morning? - Hey, even on death row you get a 48 hour reprieve. - Go to your bank on Tuesday. - All right. - Don't try to trick me. Got a cigarette for me? - Ain't got any, sorry. - I'll send Hans to buy some. - No, I'll go to the village. Get me some matches too, friend. - Pierluigi. - Yes? Going to the village? I'll join you. Watch out! - Did you see that crazy jerk? - That guy's a drunk, not crazy. - You know that guy? - Of course I do. He's the castles surgeon, but he should be a butcher. - He costs more in whiskey than in wages. - You in competition with the guy? Quite the opposite, actually, but let's forget about him. Take your time. I'm going to buy a newspaper. The manager, please. Hello, this is La Rocca, I'm calling about that check. Wait, I haven't finished yet. Trust me, I'll fix everything by Monday night. Give me just a little more time, please. Yes, yes. Right, I see. It's in my own best interest. Everyone believes cockfighting is merely a South American pastime. The Chinese have been doing it for thousands of years. - They actually used it to solve conflicts. - That's interesting! Can you imagine Nixon and Mao solving their issues through cockfighting? Leave it to the Americans to feed those poor animals with growth hormones, like they did with turkeys! And they'd celebrate their victories with a cockfighting parade! If we'd use a system like that here in Italy, we could say goodbye to lawyers! - Anything else, Miss? - No, thanks. You can go to bed, Berta. - Where's the champagne? - Over here. Just one bottle? You're getting as stingy as my father! - We need two or three, at least. - I'll get them. No, give me the key. I'll get them. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Good night. - Who's coming with me? - Me! - Nope, not you. I don't trust your hands. - Yup, but my heart is so warm. I still don't trust you. Let's go, Gretel. Wait here. The ﬂoor is wet and slippery. - Cristal or Dom Perignon? - Cristal. It's lighter. All right. Gretel! Gretel! Gretel, stop! Gretel! Calm down, Miss. It's me, Hans! I'm sorry, Hans, but I've just seen... - Where were you, Hans? - I went to close the gate. How many times do I have to tell you to never let Leandro out of your sight? And you must never forget to lock his door. That's Ileana's mother. She was not even 30 when she passed. She's buried in the park of the castle. The baron wanted that fabulous emerald to be buried with her. - ls it worth a lot? - More than 150 million lire. - 150 million? - More, probably. A real buried treasure. A stunning woman. One night the princess was attacked by the gardener, which she managed to kill in self-defense. Her son was with her. That terrible shock drove the boy mad. Where is he, now? I don't know exactly, but I heard he's in some German clinic in Beirut. - Was the mother from there? - No, she was from Thailand. She was only 16 when the baron married her. - Quite a catch for the old geezer. - You can say it. According to some doctors, the boy's sickness is due to the baron's old age. But they spared the old man the news. Did you also have an affair with her? - Do I have your word? - I won't say anything, don't worry. Thank you. Such a tragedy took a heavy toll on my family. - He's absolutely harmless. - I won't say anything. Leandro? Leandro? Mommy! Mommy! Leandro! Leandro! You stupid ass! I've looked for you everywhere! It's your fault I was told off by your slut of a sister! Leave the boy alone! Come to Berta, Leandro. Don't look at that mean Hans. He'll go to hell for hurting my baby. "Les Biches"? - I give up. - All ﬁlms have scenes like that now! - Still enjoyable, though, who cares about charades. - No, you have to guess! "Le salamandre"? Well done, that's it! Now it's your turn! Lights out, please. - "A Clockwork Orange"! - That's right! - Whose turn is it now? - Me and Ileana. - Ileana, what's wrong? - Do you feel sick? - Who's that? - It's me, Elsa. Open the door. Elsa! Open the door, I need to talk to you. - You locking the door now? - You want to tell me that was just a game? That's right, a game. - Don't tell me you're jealous. - I'm not. It was your idea to play that game. You call a game choosing Gretel and screwing her in front of everyone? But if I had chosen you, dear... Well, you know we must keep it secret. - Who cares? - What about your parents? You're thinking about my parents, eh? Don't worry, they won't interdict me. Their money will be all mine, but you can forget it. If I really have to buy a husband, I can ﬁnd a much better one than you. Someone saw you in the corridor at the time of the crime. - That's not true. - Really? - I was asleep, Inspector, I swear! - Of course. - I swear I was sleeping! - Sure, sure. You were all asleep, except for one who slept less than the others. I had one too many drinks, it made me sleep like a log. Oh, but you also made love before sleeping. Your underwear was very much telling, dear boy. - That's an invasion of my privacy! - Come on... You shouldn't have done it! Tell me something, are you worried as well about your privacy being invaded? Not at all. My conscience is clean. Clean as that glass on your night stand? Whiskey, Inspector. An excellent Chivas. - Am I violating the law for one last drink before bed? - No, absolutely not. But it looks like that bottle came from the wine cellar. That's exactly where I took it. You had blood on your hands and on your dressing gown. And perhaps this makes me the least likey suspect, right? Good point, or maybe you're trying to build an ironclad alibi. But I just touched her instinctively. I liked Elsa, we were good friends. So I guess that's why she conﬁded in you. Her last secrets. Yes, exactly. Speaking as a doctor and a psychologist, you reckon a sadist might have done it rather than a sex maniac? I'm very much convinced of it. You also believe the killer was an expert at handling a knife, but not a scalpel. Either that or he made it look like he couldn't use a scalpel too well. You could be very helpful to the forensic team. Too bad your theory and your alibi are, well, a little shaky. - Am I a suspect, too? - Just like everybody else! This castle is the obvious place to look for the culprit. That's right, indeed. Having said that, why should I tell you if I knew something? To help the law, of course. Don't you think so? Are you the last person to go to bed? I am, usually. But yesterday the guests stayed up late. And I have to get up before dawn. It's strange, indeed. It's strange that you didn't hear anything. The servants' quarters are far from the guests' ones. They're far... And Berta? Are you together? In the servants' quarters, I mean. I know what you're trying to imply, Inspector. I'd rather become a monk than touch that lady. You're hiding something from me. I've told you everything I know. Everything I remember. Everything you don't want to remember, maybe. I let out a scream when I saw the baron, and that's when Mr. Frank appeared. You already told me, but that's not what I want to know. The real question is if you suspect anything. Anything or anyone. I think you do, but you're afraid of something. You're afraid to say yes. You're quite afraid, indeed. Just like your worthy collaborator, Hans. Who is he, anyway? What is he to you? Are you sleeping with him? That's just crazy. Did he tell you that? It's not true, it's a lie! Sure, sure, you're a regular virgin. We'll resume this conversation later. Yeah, yeah. I know, Moretti. I know that Hans said he's not sleeping with her. It would have been very useful to this case if he had. Especially if it were true. - How is he? - What a horrible night, Inspector. The daughter is still in shock, and he hasn't regained consciousness yet. Having a heart attack at his age is pretty serious, but... But what? His fiber is strong. He has already survived two heart attacks. He may survive the third one. Let's hope so. He could be very useful to the investigation. - Don't tell anyone, of course. - What about his daughter? I'll tell her myself. I'll tell her he's fine, actually. You know what I mean, Doctor? The old man has seen the murderer. - Unless he's the murderer himself. - I understand. - Remember, nobody enters here without my permission. - Yes, Inspector. - What? You having doubts? - No, but what about the doctor? Well, you can let him in the room without my permission. Some good news, ﬁnally. The baron is out of danger. A miracle, considering his age. He could be back among his knick-knacks even today! Chinese antiques, Inspector. What would the baron say if he could hear you? - I didn't mean any disrespect, I'm happy he's recovering. - Aren't we all? - Not the murderer, I believe. - Personally, I'm overjoyed. Sure, but we'll have to see if that's because he's out of danger... or because he'll be able to tell us who did it and free you from blame. - And that goes for all of you. - Why should one of us be the murderer? Oh, all of you here plus Miss Ileana. - Shall I bring her in, Inspector? - No, let her rest. So... After questioning each of you individually, I'd now like to do a brief summary together to check if your versions fit. Let me begin by saying that, voluntarily or not, you're all hiding something. For instance, Dr. Hoffman, you didn't tell me that you helped Dr. Olsen embalming the baroness. Quite the opposite. He's the one that assisted me. You don't like each other much, huh? They chose to use my embalming method, Inspector. And Olsen never forgave you for that. It's not easy to admit defeat, you see. - That's why he hates me. - You sound like you have nothing against him. - He's just an old drunk, that's all. - Right, that's true. Enough alchemy for now, let's get more substantial. You all claim to have told me the truth. But I beg to differ, you're all hiding something and I'm going to find what it is. Your alibis are tight, apparently. Weirdly enough, you all claim to have been asleep during the murder. But it was so late at night that sleeping'd have been the only sensible thing to do. If you really were asleep, of course. Well, yes. Hey. - I was looking for you! - Stop! You crazy? - Where is it? - Where is it what? - You know what I'm talking about! - Cut it out, I don't know anything! Tell me where it is or I swear I'll kill you! What you doin‘ now? Tell me where it is! Coward. We don't give a shit. You either cough up the dough or the snow. I don't have it anymore, they stole it from me! I need 48 hours! You taking me for a chump, pal? Time's up. Not a minute more, get it? Meet us at midnight by the 19 km road marker, unless you prefer us to come there. An emerald worth 150 million... Buried with her body... Buried with her body... Buried with her body... Worth 150 million... Buried... 150 million... - It's late. - I bet our guy ain't showing up. - He's gonna make a run for it. - He ain't that fucking dumb. - Yeah, like we aren't gonna bag him anyway. - Here he comes. - Where's the dough? - I told you, I don't have it. - What about the snow? - Sorry, desolated. If you say so... How are you doing this morning, Ileana? Tell me. Your father was probably familiar with the murderer's face, seeing how catastrophically he reacted. - Don't you think so? - I'm still too shaken to give you an answer. The shock or something else. Stay out of my affairs, or I'll confiscate your whiskey. Oh, don't worry. I love my whiskey too much. But are you sure that your father didn't make a name, a sign, anything? Come in. - You're here. - Surprised? A little, to be honest. The two entrances are heavily guarded, how did you get in? It was too easy, Inspector. There's a third entrance. Only me and the family know about it. It's right behind the park. Damn it, I should have considered this possibility. Guess I'm becoming a little senile. Yes, indeed. So, how are you feeling? Much better, thank you. I need all your help, Miss. Stay, please. - You could be useful, too. - As you wish. I've got this strange feeling you're all hiding something from me. Such as? Oh, that would mean I'd have found out who the murderer is. I could give you a single example, though. Why do you take drugs? - I've never taken any drugs! - Never, except for last night. Someone drugged me. Of course, I'm not excluding it, but who would have wanted to? Who would have drugged you? - I know who, as a matter of fact. - Stop invading my private life, Inspector. It affects all of you. Nothing is private now. However, I wanted to talk about something else. About that other thing. The one I don't know yet. The one you're hiding from me. I don't know what you're talking about. Tell me why there's so much embalming equipment in this house, then. You keep saying you don't know anything, but I suggest you to tell the truth. Or, rather, to stop hiding it. For the sake of us all. Inspector! Inspector... Go on, Miss. Come with me, Moretti. Get a move on. Be kind, Inspector. It's been years since he's seen a stranger. I understand, don't worry. But I have to know. Leandro? Leandro? Leandro? It's me, Ileana, don't be afraid. Where are you hiding? I brought you a nice gift from your Chinese friends. They gave me a quinine oil that's lovely to treat fur. You know how skilled they are at embalming. Come out, Leandro, please. Where are you? Mommy! Mommy! No! Leandro, no! Be good now, Leandro. These people wanted to see you for a minute. They'll leave soon. I've brought you a box of assorted animal eyes, you know? They make them out of precious stones. It's a technique known exclusively by the Chinese. They look real, you'll see. What a talented boy. You're really talented, Leandro. An artist like you should be famous. You'd have so many clients. Nice. You're a real artist, you know all the secrets of the ancient masters. And I bet Leandro is also good at embalming human bodies, right? I'm sure you've done it already. The body of a woman. A woman with beautiful eyes. Right, Leandro? The emerald! Something doesn't add up. I'm putting my career on the line, but I'm sure the murderer has an accomplice. An unwilling one, perhaps, but an accomplice nonetheless. Don't you wonder why that jewel disappeared from the victim's room? And no one seems to know where it is. Not mentioning the disappearance of the princess' emerald, to make matters worse. I'm more and more convinced there must be an accomplice. And I believe this accomplice may not go along with the murderer. Just imagine how much those jewels are worth! I think that dumb kid did it. I mean, we found those eyes in his room... Someone could have put them there. But it's clear this someone knows the kid lives in the castle. - Not many people know about him. - Oh, quite the opposite. Hans and Berta, for instance. Frank Hoffman, Gretel Schanz... Not counting the little baroness. And if three women know, then everyone knows. Right, Moretti? - And the motive? - The jewel, dummy. 150 million lire aren't peanuts. It's a pretty sum, even for someone wealthy. Or someone who believes he's wealthy. And I won't leave this place until I find the jewel. No one will leave the castle until then. Anyway, with a little luck, something might happen tonight. The time is right for one of the culprits to make a move. The thief could try to put the jewel back, and the kid may... It's clear as day, the kid wanted you and not your friend. It could happen again tonight, if we recreate the same situation. You only have to do exactly as I said. Don't be afraid, my men will be watching. Everything will be all right. I ask you to trust me. You'll stay in your room as usual, without being afraid of anything bad happening. Don't forget to wear the same dress you had last night, it could be crucial. Out of the way, Moretti. Leandro? Leandro? It's me, Ileana. Go on, drink it. Drink your chamomile so you can get some good sleep. This is my friend Gretel. I'm sorry, I thought Dr. Olsen was here. He said he wanted to give him an injection. Make sure he drinks his chamomile. Damn it, first the boss tells me to watch that Gretel's room, and then he tells me to go to bed. Well, maybe he wanted to do the first shift. He won't be able to watch both rooms, though, since he's also relieved you from watching the baron's. - Mine. - You and your damn luck. You owe me three of your salaries. Who's there? It's Berta, Miss. Oh, it's you. - Here's your chamomile. - Thank you, Berta. Sorry for the bother. No bother at all. It's my duty. - I took some to Miss Ileana, too. - Put it here, please. There. - Good night, then. - Good night. I hope you won't mind my question, but shall I leave the door open? - Yes. - Aren't you afraid, after everything that happened? At least that kid was useful for something. He kills and we reap the benefits. That cop will never figure it out. Wear it for a few days. That's the best hiding place. Then put it with the other stuff. The only one that worries me is Dr. Olsen. The old man won't talk, he'd never accuse his son. Once this'll be over, we'll leave this damned castle and share the loot. All right. We'll go our separate ways. That was our deal. You little maggot. I won't have to see you again, at last. Move it! You bastard! I'll get away from this shithole for good, and you'll end your clays in a nuthouse. It was Hans, wasn't it? He must have found you wandering around the park as usual. No? Did you get blood on his clothes? Then what? That Hans is a bastard, but you must learn to behave or he'll beat you for anything. And I don't want my Leandro to suffer. Listen to Uncle Wolf. Uncle Wolf wants you to get better. No, you must not do that if you want to get better. Before passing, your mother made me swear I'd have cured you. "Cure my Leandro, or I'll die of a broken heart", she said. Trust me, Leandro. You'll get better. You will. You'll get better if you'll always follow what I tell you. Always. Or else I'll stop teaching you the secrets of embalming. You know who the murderer is. We both know who did it. But it must remain a secret between you and Uncle Wolf. Sleep. Sleep, Leandro. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. I'll be damned... Look, without this I'd be counting worms now! Well, at the end of the day, I thought you'd have been more imaginative than putting the blame on that sick kid. It would have explained the mother's body, but not the other victims. And after stealing the emerald and poor Elsa's jewel, she took care of her partner in crime. But she walked into our trap when she tried to kill the baron. You know, Dr. Hoffman, for a while I thought you were the prime suspect. The most qualiﬁed, you mean. That's right, the most qualified, after everything we talked about. - I was just telling the truth. - And that's what confused me. They say truth can be the greatest deception. Why set up that other plan, Inspector, if you knew I wasn't the next victim? That was just a red herring. Politicians make good use of it. And it never fails. So we managed to find the emerald, too. - Put it back where it belongs. - Thanks, Inspector. Farewell. - Can we go now, Inspector? - Wait a minute, La Rocca. - Could you give Moretti a lift? - Of course. To the police station, then. It seems like someone found the charred bodies of two old friends of yours. You come, too. I believe this is yours. China is a fascinating place, isn't it? But that cousin of yours shouldn't have used Chinese paper. It's unmistakable! - It's like leaving a signature. - Will this take long? - I'd say so. - Damn it. There goes my French Riviera vacation. No worries, it'll still be there! Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
