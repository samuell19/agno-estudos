Rudy, take it easy! Nervous, Mr. Wade? Piece of cake. Well, don't start eating it until we hit terra firma. Terra what? - What? What? The good earth, my uneducated friend. Right on the fucking button. Nice touch. That girlfriend of yours has quite an imagination. You did it! A little run-in with their customs over Anchorage. That new demographic radar system is a bitch. I've been thinking. What about Canada? They still farm there, and none of it's genetically engineered bullshit. How can you think about food at a time like this? I was thinking about something else. Let me show you something. We're going to be millionaires. So what are those things? Head games for the masses. Biosynthetic computer chips. There are more things in heaven and Earth than dreamed in your philosophy, my dear Mr. Wade. Good old-fashioned American yankee know-how, just like you, Wade. There's a compliment in there somewhere. What's this? Californian Cabernet. It's my favorite. You've ruined the surprise. I thought we'd have a little celebration. Yeah! To our last winter in Moscow. You're not still thinking about retiring, Wade? Oh, shit! Get her out of here! Fuck! Shit. - We've been caught! We've been caught! Lay down your weapons. Stay calm. This is a military intervention. Come on! You are being monitored. Do not attempt to leave the sector. Military intervention. Go! Come on! Move it! You are in violation of Act 33 of the Military Importation Act. You are being monitored by military rescue. Do not attempt to leave the sector. You are being monitored. You are being monitored. It's coming! Come on! Let's go! It's on top of us. This is a military intervention. You are in violation of... All right, Wade! Let's go! Why? You didn't have to kill him. Wade. Wade. No! I told you I'd take care of everything. No. No! Sorry. Sorry. Who is it? Checking. John Anderson Wade. Small-time entreprenuer. American. Ex-Central Intelligence. Wanted to make a killing in the bio-weapon fantasy market. There are no criminal warrants outstanding. Burn the woman. Put his body in the cybernator. - Sir? Evidence, Tatiana. Evidence. Doctor, report to surgery. Sir? I have the president on the line. Is it secure? Naturally, sir. I just did it myself. Yes, tovarishch? Madam President, I found my first volunteer for resurrection. He may provide a break in the investigation of Moscow's new ideological subversive elements... The so-called crime syndicate... the Troika. The Troika. Remember, this is an election year. There can be no military interference in police matters. No unfounded accusations. I will exercise total discretion. Police Chief Udo will never know of our interests. May I proceed with resurrection? Thank you, Madam President. I knew you'd understand. Proceed. At this very moment, the anti-trauma culture is slowly penetrating into his cerebral cortex. It will begin creating new living biosynthetic tissue with no side effects, except for, perhaps, a little pain. Let me guess. You had a dog named Spot. You love baseball and apple pie. Your family went to church. Your parents voted Republican. What can I say, Mr. Wade? Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Don't worry. In a few months, he'll be as good as new. I guarantee it. Please remember to wash your hands with the provided sporicide when handling all carcasses and body parts marked for... Mr. Yamoto, we at the Troika feel, when it comes to illegal activities, you really have the right business instincts. Thank you, Mr. Merrick. People want the good things in life... The law of supply and demand. Yes. The wages of sin are steep. Quite true. Quite true. Please be careful. It's a museum piece. But as the demand increases, the more challenging it will become. Too challenging for one man, don't you think? You need a dynamic business organization like the Troika. I'd like some time to discuss this with my associates. Time's up. Come on. Come on, babushka. No one muscles in on my business. We at the Troika feel you should get out of this business. Try something small, perhaps something legal. Don't shoot! Back off! You're interrupting a merger talk. Do as he says! Drop your guns. No! It's yours! What? I can't quite understand you. You were saying? Here you are. The was presented today in a ceremony. The president's high commissioner has issued their interim report. Crime figures have risen 50%. The figures are even more alarming in the fifth district. There has been a jump by 81%. When asked to comment, Moscow's police chief Udo stated the situation is well under control. Here, he is seen... displaying some of the illegal weapons seized in early morning raids around Moscow. In an extraordinary move, the Roman Catholic Church has denied... Hi. Aren't you cold? Here. That's better. Take it easy. You were right to call me. Moves well for a dead man, don't you think? Should I call the Moscow police? No, I know exactly where he's going. We can pick him up any time we wish. Sir? He's been betrayed by his friend. He's going to get even. But sir, what about the president's orders? He has to be terminated immediately after his interrogation. Madam President will appreciate our initiative. After all, where else are we going to find such a highly motivated individual to help with our investigation? I understand. Moscow urbans, please do not leave any baggage unattended. You got any pain killers? I got dollars. Remember, to govern is to choose. Remember, man's capacity for evil makes democracy necessary. But man's capacity for good makes democracy possible. Remember, one can resent people in a democracy. Hey, Pops. I've changed my mind about those dollars. Give us your money. Come on. All right, buttonhead. Come on, old man. Hey guys! Wait up! Wait! Remember, man's capacity for evil makes democracy necessary. Madam President, I regret the report there was nothing I could do. Wade has escaped, but the situation is well in hand. I will continue to keep you informed. Plug in your fantasies directly. Dinojack, made in the USA. Build to last. Dinojack, the gateway to your cerebral cortex. Dinojack... tap into the real you. Plug in your fantasies directly. Dinojack, made in the USA. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Wade? I thought you were dead. Don't tell me I'm in heaven. This is a Chinese knockoff of a Colt Python. It's 50 years old. It's a good gun. You can blow the nuts off a bull from 100 meters. Is that all you got? Depends what you have. Let me show you something. This is very special. Vengeance is mine, said the Lord. Democracy and all the changes in our society are behind the current climate. People don't have any sense of control over themselves these days. We must regain our moral anchor. Sorry, we're closed. I'm looking for Mishka. He's not here. Why don't you let me see for myself? OK. OK. Come on. Come on. Try looking under the bed. What the... Jesus Christ, Wade. Let me guess. You thought I was dead. - This is impossible. Holy shit! Come on! Sit down. Sit down. So how have you been? - Who, me? Fine! I mean, terrible. You know, when I heard, you should have seen me. I was all broken up. I mean, I couldn't fucking believe it. You're dead! You know? OK, here. And it's like... it's like... So where is he? Who? Who do you think? Merrick. I tried to warn you, my friend. I mean, I told you, don't underestimate Merrick. That money is my retirement fund. Forget about it. Where is he? Holy shit, Wade. Things aren't the way it used to be. Look. You've been a good friend, and you always came through for me. Try Marina K. at the House of Culture. It's fantastic. They make it work. Mishka's here. What's up? Have you heard? I hear a lot of things. Well, Wade is looking for you. Wade? Impossible. Are you crazy? Certifiably. I wasted the fucker. I blew his brains out. Yeah? Well, I guess you missed this one. I don't know what you're up to. I never miss. Of course not. I'm only the messenger! The what? The messenger brings his empire bad tidings! I like you, Mishka. You do? And because I like you, I'm going to let you do me a favor. If Wade is alive, you're going to kill him for me. What? Waste him. He trusts you. It should be easy for you. Everything OK? Some old business. Nothing important. Good, good. Welcome to Moscow's House of Culture. Please remember to check all weapons before entering any private rooms. Marina K.? - Room 228. Make your first appointment by phone. All weapons must be left at the customer courtesy desk. Book your hostess at our courtesy desk. This way. Your fantasy is our reality. Have a pleasant stay. First time in Moscow? What's wrong? Are you OK? Any inhibitions? None that I'm aware of. You have to tell me what you want. I'm no mind reader. My name is Marina K. I know who you are. Where's Merrick? How should I know? The man, he likes variety. And what are you, a cop or something? You're too smart to play dumb. Where is he? Look, I told you already, I don't know. Funny. Is Merrick all you're interested in? Yes. And if I help you, what's in it for me? Dollars. Lots of them. OK. I can ask around. Have you got a name? John Doe. You're American. I knew it. I love Americans. Put your clothes back on. You're a mess. What happened? Nothing. Why don't you stay here and get some rest? I'll be fine. So why are we looking for him? None of your business. Steel bondage. Suspension. English. So how was she? Did you enjoy yourself? I trust she gave you a real fine fourth-dimensional good time. She was, good. Excellent. Short and sweet. Body modification. "Sextropolis." Torture garden. Fetish market. Left. Level three, unit five. Can you hand me a towel? Marina K.? It's you. How did you find me? Where's your boss? Mishka is not here yet. Honest. Fancy seeing you here. Marina K. What happened to your accent? I did some checking on you. So you and Merrick used to be partners and you had a falling out. That's right. Don't worry. I can be very discreet. I want to help you. Let's cut the crap. OK. I've got some information. Fucking machine. Hey, Mishka, baby. How's it hanging? - Good. Listen. I'd like to place an order for immediate termination. Yeah, you know, but, no rubles this time. Dollars. Fine, fine. As long as it gets done. John Anderson Wade. And I need it done now, pronto. Sounds to me like you got yourself into some client in Nevada. And you know that's going to cost extra. What's it going to be... Overnight, same day, or would you like express service, special delivery, parcel post? How do you want it? - Fuck it. Just get it done. OK, I'll put my best people on it. Give me the details. You're just going to try to talk to him and convince him to give you your money back, aren't you? That's the general idea. And you won't try to kill him, because that would be really stupid. It's a matter of principle. Well, it's nice to know a man whose morality is so hard intact. I'll be right back. Wade? Hey, baby. Looks like your boyfriend flew the coup. So boys, what will it be? Ass or pussy? He's not my boyfriend. All weapons must be checked at the door. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Welcome to Moscow. Climbing into the ring, Big Joe. All right. All right. The next six rounds are Big Joe and Slugger Spurlock. You're a real public servant... My kind of guy. If you ever think about running for political office, Chief. Udo, you can count on my backing... My full resources. Let's can the bullshit, Serge. I know. Business first. Always business first. Money has made the transfer. Your New York account is now fat with dollars. I appreciate your continued cooperation in this matter. There is a slight problem. Anti-racketeering, a special prosecutor in the Fifth District. This is an election year. How much to buy him off? I can be very generous, no? Unfortunately, his identity is unknown. He has the president's mandate. Uncorruptable. Ridiculous. He's just a petty bureaucrat. Maybe. He'll soon lose interest. They all do. Of course Merrick's right. I know that bureaucratic type. But we don't want to draw attention to ourselves yet. Period of calm is the wisest course. Period of consolidation. Sally. Chief, have you met Sally? Hello. Endorphins, vodka, designer drugs? You're looking very foxy tonight. Or me? What are you in the mood for, Sally? Depends on you. By the way, where's your partner, Vanya? Busy in Crimea. The ruble deal with the State Bank. Your mysterious friend is always busy. He's an ambitious man, just like our friend Merrick. He works hard. But at least Merrick here knows how to enjoy himself. Tovarishches! Soon, within our grasp shall be those countries that are our Russian birthright. We shall reclaim them and the presidency. Ha! Pals of yours? Mind your own business. I should be angry with you, Wade, for skipping out on me. Maybe I should let them kill you. You're just a male chauvinist capitalist pig. What a gentleman. So much for the element of surprise! I thought you said you wanted your money back! What? - The money! Assholes. Merrick! What are you doing? You don't trust anyone, do you? Especially women. Especially women. Do you know what your problem is? That women intimidate you. We don't fit into your macho world. You got me all figured out. But you don't know shit. So is this our first fight? Good evening, Miss. Thanks so much for your galette. Delicious. I'm so glad you enjoyed it. Watch out for the cat. I must admit, I underestimated you. Sorry about the mess. It's very nice. I... hold still. Is this your family? You must have been well-off. I like the pony. So did we. We had to eat him when the economy collapsed. Really? No. I was kidding. Sorry. Well. Quite a Girl Scout. And what are you, Wade? You're no Boy Scout. Just look at you. If I didn't know any better, it seems that you look happy. I'm working on it. And what happened to that stark frown of yours? Marina, it's cold. You're trembling. I am. I like you. Damn, you want to be with me. I want you. I look like her, don't I? No. You're nothing like her. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. Yes, you did. And you loved her. It's none of my business. Moscow's most wanted criminals on channel 724, coming to you 24 hours a day, every day. If you have any information about the criminals portrayed this evening, a cash reward is waiting for you. Cameras are here. Lots of close-ups. Lots of close-ups. I'm impressed. You're a regular Eisenstein. He turned this into a real meat locker. I'll have twice as many government bureaucrats breathing down my neck. Very unhealthy for everyone. Let's just keep this between us. I don't want Serge bothered by such trivial problems. I want you to know a special cash bonus will be coming from me. No problem. The guy's got real guts. What's his name? Wade. Wade. I think I'll enjoy killing him. Don't you wonder why? Why what? Why you've been given a second chance. Try not to think about it. What's that? Hello? Tonight, we need your help in locating the criminal John Anderson Wade, last seen in Moscow city center. He is an American national. He is armed and dangerous. Approach with caution. Comrades, please remember while watching tonight's show all criminals portrayed are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. John Anderson Wade... Estimated time of capture, ten minutes. Again, I repeat, if you have any information... Stay where you are. About the criminals portrayed this evening, a cash reward is waiting. Go back! Go back! Here! This way! When I came here 40 years ago, we could leave our doors unlocked. Now it's gangsters and crooked police and politicians fighting each other with machine guns. If you kill him, I still get my reward, won't I? Hey, tovarishch. Nice night. Hey, lady. Ready to suck my... Comrades, please remember while watching my show, all criminals portrayed are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Thank you for joining us this evening. Remember, if you have any information about the criminals portrayed this evening, a cash reward is waiting for you. Tonight, we need your help in locating the criminal John Anderson Wade, last seen in Moscow city center. He is an American national. He is armed and dangerous. Approach with caution. Comrades... please remember while... Let's get him. My show, all criminals portrayed are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Thank you. This way. Over here. Come on. They are getting away! Get up here. - There they are! Are you crazy? Let's get them! Come in! Relax! You look great. Fuck. I wish I looked as good. Bet you work at it. Every day. No fucking muscle grafts or face lifts for me. That's great. I like my boys to look sharp. I've been watching TV lately. Seen things... disturbing things. You said this guy Wade was an easy score. He was your friend. Now it's a big fuck-up. No one wants an associate who needs his ass covered all the time. It sets a bad example for others. Right, Vanya? That's right, Serge. Very bad example. You see, you're the one who's supposed to be the specialist, the one who knows how to handle people. I'll take care of Wade. It's nothing. I don't want assurances. I want guarantees. I bring a guy in... A new partner... I'm taking a chance. I don't like taking chances. I understand. I hope you understand the way I understand? It's Hawaii. No, it's Crimea, central Russia's only Hawaiian resort. Authentic island atmosphere. Aloha Travel... win a trip for two. Guess you don't like Moscow much. It's just business. I get my money, I'm going someplace warm. Do you like fishing? Ice fishing? It's peaceful. No. I didn't think you would. What about you? Don't you have any dreams? Yeah. Survival, pure and sweet. You can come visit. Just drink your tea. I'm not kidding. My mother warned me about guys like you. And now, the president. As I was saying in the past, I have no plans to change policy. Isn't that your friend? Son of a bitch! Get out of my way! Mishka! Shit. Mishka. What are you doing here? Are you crazy? I'm sorry. You want to help me? - Yeah. Stay put. OK. Sure. Private party. Invitation only. Invite me. May I take your coat, sir? No, thanks. Remember, man's capacity for evil makes democracy necessary. Man's capacity for good makes democracy possible. Remember, one can democracy. One cannot. Listen, Wade. You don't understand. It's Merrick. I didn't want anything to do with it. He made me! You're neutral. Swear to Christ. Please, Wade. You're a friend. That's right. But you're a damn liar. It was just business! Nothing personal! Just business? Remember this? I found it. My leg! My leg! Just business. Thank you, Wade. Thank you. What's wrong with you? You're under arrest. Don't move. I... I'm sorry about the blood on the carpet, man. I'm OK. I just need a little help. So, what's up? What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? I brought him to you, right? I played my part! How many times have I told you not to be sloppy with your ammo? Sorry, boss. Hey, Merrick. Did anybody ever tell you you're a fucking asshole? Don't let it happen again. While using the automatic torture program, always remember to monitor the subject's vital signs. Subject's vital signs have become dangerously unstable. Death is predicted in 12 seconds. 11, 10, nine, eight, seven... Party's over. Stop the termination. Are you crazy? The automatic torture prgram is still running. This person is to be killed. The special prosecutor wants to download. Get me a secure line. Termination sequence aborted. OK. OK. Police Chief Udo won't know the difference. Report... the program was run successfully. The criminal Wade is dead. But I'm requesting a transfer. I'm a doctor. I can no longer work under these conditions. Mr. Wade, welcome to the Office for Special Prosecutions. I'm sorry. I only just learned about your detainment. I'm afraid Chief Udo has rather archaic ideas of iron fist of the law and all that. I know a lot about you, Wade. I've been inside your brain, so to speak. What are you, my social worker? I am, as a matter of fact. Yes, I'm here to counsel you, to help you through these trying times. Really? Yeah, and I want you to help me in my investigation of the Troika. Chief Udo has been, shall we say, strangely ineffective in this particular case. Where's the girl? Already released. This doesn't involve her. Your decision? I'll think about it. You owe me, Wade. You should be more grateful. After all, it was I who resurrected you. You were the first. Just think of the possibilities. You were technically dead. Now you're alive. You have my personal intervention and the full medical resources of the president to thank. I wouldn't want either of us to regret it. All I want you to do is kill Merrick. At this very moment, your pal... At this very moment, your pal, Merrick, is preparing an old-style May Day celebration. An old-style May Day celebration. An old-style May Day celebration in honor of your demise. If I were in your position, I know what I'd do. It's the principle of the thing. A girl has to know how to take care of herself. We all have to think of our futures. Consider this a deposit. We want no loose ends in this matter, including Wade. Understood? Perfectly. Democracy and all the changes in our society are behind the current climate. People don't have any sense of control over themselves these days. We must regain our moral anchor. Wade. Are you OK? How can you trust the special prosecutor? I don't. Leave it. Escape while you still can. There's only one thing that is important to me now. Of course. Primitive, hopeless revenge. You're 200 years out of step. Just cut a deal. Everyone else does. I might need your help. Am I supposed to be flattered? Madam President, I'm pleased to report that the scurrilous rumors of corruption against Chief Udo are totally unfounded. There's been no attempt by the Troika to destabilize the government. The troika is no more subversive than good old-fashioned business know-how. And the criminal, Wade? His termination has commenced. Good, Vanya. I shall remember your service to me and to the state. Pathetic. She's a dinosaur. You know, I'm only doing this for the good of Russia. The values of the Troika are something we should all try to emulate, don't you think? Yes, sir. This change of career is going to suit us both. But remember, sole proprietorship is best. Partners are always such an unnecessary pain in the ass. License and registration, please. You're not skipping out on me, are you? It's a nice car. A gift from a high ranking government official. How high? Don't worry. He's dead. Remind me not to go into politics. Is there anything you need to tell me? When I side with a man, I stay with him. Just a moment. I'm on special order from the House of Culture. You know, I didn't think you'd make it. I'm glad you're here. I'll be right back. Me first, mon cherie. You're sure we've never met? I would remember. Trust me. A little more privacy? How sweet. Actually, I prefer an audience. You're a sorry excuse for a human being. I want my money, nice and slow. I don't believe it. Neither do I. Wait! Once I fuck someone, I never forget their face. Great job, baby. Catch you later. And you, remember to show my boys a good time. Let go! Just like the old days, Wade. I can't believe you're so stupid. Isn't life amazing? Just when you think you've got things figured out, fate comes along and tries to grab you by the nuts. I keep asking myself, what's wrong with this picture? Don't do anything I wouldn't do. For the pain, old friend. I'm trying to quit. You're dead, you're alive. So how can this be? I consider myself to be a man of average intelligence. Pondering it, I've come to the conclusion you probably had help. But from whom? I want my money. Invested in the Troika. Ironic, isn't it? You and I co-finance the entire operation. Here I am on the board of directors. And you, not even a single share of stock. Where's the boss? Serge? I don't really think he's interested in hearing from you. Why the fuck am I talking to you? Give me that. Get back here. Shit! Fuck, it's empty! Get the car. OK. Didn't I tell you to get the car? I got busy. Let's get the fuck out of here! Are you hungry? We're not done yet. Merrick's dead, isn't he? Aren't you forgetting something? The money. All this killing has made you crazy. Join the club. Fetish market, steel bondage, torture garden, suspension. Sometimes, it feels like things are veering out of control, Serge. There's never a moment's peace. Can't a guy get laid in peace without you guys annoying him? So who made the hit? We're checking into that. Allow me. You're such a gentleman. Au revoir. I killed Merrick. Congratulations. Merrick turned out to be a real screw-up. Frankly, you did me a favor. You've got a reward coming. There's a place for you in the organization. No, thanks. Look, I understand your frustration. Merrick betrayed you, stole from you, all completely unauthorized. Not a man of his word. But how does that involve me? He wasn't working for himself. He was following orders. And you think those orders came from me? All this over money? Are you nuts? Do you know who I am? My organization is going to run this country! You better get the money. I'll tell you where and I'll tell you when. Never fuck with a man's dreams. I think you're out of your own mind. You better not disappoint me like that scumbag Merrick? Serge, you worry too much. Trust me. I leave nothing to chance. Besides, I have it on good authority that the special prosecutor has quit the case. So why did you really come to Moscow? Let me guess. One last score. How romantic. Yeah, well, the whole idea of this pisses me off, paying off some punk. A guy like Wade doesn't go away so easily. You either have to pay him off or kill him. So let's kill the fucker? Is this place Wade's idea of a joke? He's an American. What do you expect? I don't like it, Vanya. No one moves! It's all here, my friend... Every cent he owed you. What are you doing? Here's your money! I'm sorry, Serge. Looks like you've been bought out. Wade, you can come out now. It's yours. You've more than earned it, from me. Don't worry. It's all there. Wade, come on. It's OK now. I've taken over. I'm in charge now. So come on, comrade. We're waiting. Time is money. Wade, it's OK. Well, what are you waiting for? Come on, it's OK. What are you doing? Trust me. Come out, come out, wherever you are. You're CIA. Yes. You don't understand. I have orders to protect the Russian president. A company woman. And I'm your last loose end. Stop! Don't go. Voter turnout has been better than expected. With only 75% of the districts reporting, Pravda's computer predicts the president of Russia will be re-elected by an overwhelming majority. In other news, anti-crime special prosecutor Vanya. Terzinski and Moscow's police chief Udo, who were murdered by unknown members of Moscow's notorious underworld, have been posthumously awarded the People's Red Star for their services to... Do you think anyone is going to believe that bullshit? What difference does it make? Depends who's side you're on. I don't know. I've retired. I think you're going to like Rio. Yeah. I'm sorry. Dooby doo. Dooby doo. Ooh. Dooby dooby. Ooh. I don't need you here by my side no more, no more, no, no. And when I feel your love deep inside, I will forget. So don't you dare come knocking on my door when you need someone to hold. Because every door and window is closed. I can live without your love. Dooby dooby dooby doo doo doo. Dooby dooby dooby yes. Dooby dooby dooby doo doo doo. I don't need your love anymore. Dooby dooby dooby doo doo doo. Dooby dooby dooby yes. Dooby dooby dooby doo doo doo. I don't need your love. Dum dum da dee dee dum dum da. Dum dum da dee dee dum. Dum dum da dee dee dum dum da. You left me. You went away. Yes, yes, baby. And now you say you're back to stay. No way. No way. So don't you dare come knocking on my door when you need someone to hold. Because every door and window is closed. I can live without your love. Dooby dooby dooby doo doo doo. Dooby dooby.
