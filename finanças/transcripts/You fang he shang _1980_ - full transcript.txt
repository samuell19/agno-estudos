(gong ringing) (water crashes) (arms whoosh) - [Narrator] Throughout China's 5000 years of history, Kung fu has evolved as the top form of martial art. Many different styles have been developed. The originator of the Crane Fist, Madame Wu Mae, was from Shaolin. Watching the crane fight an eagle, and then a snake, she decided to learn its movements, the four actions, fly, sing, perch, peck, the four basic movements of the Crane Fist style. Later, a monk, Liu Kung, from Cheq Yung Temple learned it. He studied the four moves, fly, sing, perch, peck, and perfected them. His Crane Fist became powerful. Abbot Liu Kung ventured from the temple once a year, traveling far and wide. If he ran into trouble, he would use his kung fu to teach his enemies a lesson and help reform them. Criminals who met Liu Kung soon changed their ways. It wasn't long before people gave him the nickname of the Wandering Monk. (gong rings) (gentle instrumental music) (birds tweet) (shouting) - [Liu Kung] Buddha be praised. - Hey there, monk, what's up, what do you want? - Listen, boy, all creatures have a right to life and life in the universe is a dimension. - Is that a fact? Well, I only know I'm hungry, I want some fish. (tinkling instrumental music) (shouting) - Say again, what's it you want? - My arm, let me go! (grunting) (splashing) You're big, but you ain't that good. Don't try to cross me again. You do? (grunts) - Listen, boy. (birds tweet) (grunting) Again? What do you want this time? - Let me go, let me go! (grunting) - Have mercy, Buddha, have mercy. (grunting) - Damn you, monk, you've got a nerve. Don't you let me catch you again, or else. (grunts) - Buddha be praised. - Come on, practice now. - Right! - Sir! (grunting) (fleshy smacks) - Hey, you. - Huh? - What are you doing here? - I wanna see the abbot. - Our master is busy. And get lost! Go on, push off! - Bring him over here. (speaks foreign language) - Master, you shouldn't have hit me so hard. - [Abbot] Be harder next time if you don't practice more. - [Boy] Abbot. - What do you want, my son? - I was hoping you'd teach me kung fu. - Hmm, kung fu? But you're so young. Why do you wanna learn, hmm? - Abbot, just teach me kung fu, please. - Well, where do you live, boy? - I have no home, but I am staying at Fan's village. - Oh? (mysterious instrumental music) Fan's village. Huh. (chuckles) Yes, I know it, it's renowned for its beautiful women. - Why mention that? - (chuckles) You go back and tell Mr. Fan, I'll visit him tomorrow. - All right, no problem, I know Mr. Fan. He befriended me when I was younger. I'll get him to invite you for dinner tomorrow. - Oh? - But you got to teach me kung fu. - Hmm, okay. - Welcome, Abbot. Please. (rapid instrumental music) This way, please. Abbot? - Oh, Mr. Fan, thank you. (grunting) - Abbot, mind the stairs. - Thank you. What a pity, who was that girl? That girl? - She's my daughter. - Oh, well why don't you ask her to come and join us? - Afraid she's not feeling well. Please, excuse me. - Pity, that's too bad. - Sit down. - Oh, please, sit down. Sit down, enjoy yourselves. Have a seat. - I wonder why Father invited him. Ah Shang. - Mistress? - Take a look at him. - Yes. - Eat up. - Only vegetables? (comical instrumental music) I thought since you're a monk. - Oh, yes, a monk. (laughs) You see, I am a follower of the new, most venerable order. So I have special dispensation to eat meat. - Mistress, I think he's a fraud. He's not a monk, he eats meat, monks don't eat meat. (comical instrumental music) - Please, eat up, please, eat. - Excellent, wonderful! (comical instrumental music) You find it strange that I eat meat? I actually eat meat, but I don't regard it as being meat. You see, everything I eat is vegetable. It's as simple as that, you see? (comical instrumental music) Wine? The wine? A drink! - Wine, too? - It's all the same to me. Serve the wine. (gentle instrumental music) (comical instrumental music) - Who's that? Ah Shang, see who's knocking. - Right. (percussive instrumental music) - Leave. (Ah Shang groans) (Abbot chuckling) - What are you doing here? Get out of here! - Oh, very pretty. I'm sure you can guess what I want, lady. (grunting) - Don't come any closer, you'll be sorry. (fleshy smacks) (grunting and groaning) You lecherous swine, you. Keep away from me. You're just an animal! (grunting) - I'm surprised, such a pretty girl, and so good at kung fu, too! (dramatic instrumental music) - I invited you as my guest. Instead, you try and rape my daughter! - Okay, you'll be sorry. - All right, leave him. Just let him go. - Dad, you could've beaten him. Why let him go, why didn't you capture him and take him to court? - No, forgive him, my dear. Besides, I'm getting old, I'm not so strong anymore. So I can do without asking for trouble. Now, in future, you'll all be on your guard. - Yes. - Yes. (exciting instrumental music) - [Guard] Hey, what's going on? - [Guard] Hey, what's the matter? - Oh, we better hide now, the monk's coming! When he gets here, we'll attack him. Come on, let's hide. - [Men] Right! - Come on, split up! - Okay. (exciting instrumental music) (pulsing instrumental music) This damn monk must belong to the same gang. We mustn't let him get away. Right! - Mister, there must be some mistake. - [Head Guard] Don't listen to his crap, come on! (grunting) - There must be some mistake. Take me to the governor. - Sure, come on. (dramatic instrumental music) - I'm so sorry, we just thought you belonged to the same gang as that evil monk. - Buddha be praised. No follower of Buddha can do such an evil thing. - Do you think he could be an imposter, not a real monk? - But I have never met this man, so I can't answer your question yet, but I would-- - All bullshit! I'm sure he's in league with that monk. (tinkling instrumental music) Governor, it was my fault bringing that monk, but this time, they can't make use of me. - Chou Shang, what are you saying? - Don't let his holy clothes deceive you. Fact is, they are in league with each other. - Chou Shang, don't tell lies, where's your proof? - Proof? Well, I've seen the two of them together. - Buddha be praised. In view of what this boy has just said to you, I have to clear my name and prove my innocence, and I do not intend to leave this village until I have done that. (mysterious instrumental music) - Come on, say sorry for what you did. Won't give you food til you do. - I won't say sorry, I've done no wrong. - Why won't you, tell me, why won't you say so? - Because I want to teach you what's right and what's wrong. It's for your own good. - Don't wanna know what's right and what's wrong. (dramatic instrumental music) - What was that? That evil monk is on his way here? - [Servant] Yes, sir. - Dad, we shouldn't let him escape this time. - You're right. For the sake of this village, we'll have to get rid of him! (determined instrumental music) - [Chou Shang] Hey, monk, quickly, come on, come on! - What's wrong? Why are you so excited? - That evil monk's come here to make trouble. - Oh? He's here now? - You haven't eaten for days now. Get you some food right away. Hey, you need your strength, that man is tough. (dramatic instrumental music) - Chou Mae, I guess that evil monk has come back for you. I think it's best that you stay inside. - [Chou Mae] Right, Dad. (dramatic instrumental music) - Old man Fan, if you know what's good for you, better give me Chou Mae. - Bastard! You have to be out of your mind! - Right! - Right! (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) - Last time, I was a bit drunk, didn't feel like fighting, so you got off very lightly, but, today, I'll kill you unless you give me your daughter. - No way! (fleshy smacks) (grunts) (exciting instrumental music) - Mr. Fan! - Buddha be praised. - Hey, kid, how dare you betray me? - I, but I didn't. - [Abbot] You better keep out of this, monk, it's none of your business. - [Liu Kung] Buddha be praised. I am Liu Kung, and I am from Cheq Yung Temple. What's your name, my good brother? - Chien King. - If you're a monk, how come you indulged in wine, women, and eat meat? (laughing) - What's the big deal? I might as well tell you the truth. I'm no bloody monk. I couldn't stand that kind of life. My name's Liu Bah Tin. Now get out of my way. You are getting on my nerves! (dramatic instrumental music) - Buddha be praised. - Listen here, you stupid monk, try stopping me. Let's see if you can defeat me. We'll see who's boss, come on! (dramatic instrumental music) (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) - Mister, Buddha's always merciful. Repent, it's never too late. - Why don't you shut up? Stop your preaching. (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) Had enough? Teach you to mind your own business. (fleshy smacks) (grunts) (bone grinding) (Mr. Fan chuckles) (fleshy thuds) (grunts) (groaning) - Buddha be praised. - Huh? (shouting) (fleshy thwacks) (grunts) (laughing) - [Liu Bah Tin] What else do you know? Gimme your best shot! - Fly, sing, perch, peck. - Huh? The Crane Style. (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunts) (groaning) (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunts) (buzzing whooshing) (groaning) (dramatic instrumental music) (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) (thunderous smacks) (dramatic instrumental music) (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (thunderous smack) (groaning) - Buddha be praised. Mister, repent, and all your sins will then be forgiven. Change your ways, man, it's never too late. - Thank you for sparing me. (moans) - Buddha be praised. Mercy, mercy. - Abbot, Abbot, thank you for helping us. - There's no need to thank me. Now that my name's been cleared, I have to be on my way. Buddha be praised. Young man. Goodbye now. (gentle instrumental music) - [Chou Shang] Abbot! Abbot! Wait for me, please, wait for me! Abbot, I-- - You've had your fun, young man. What do you want now? - Abbot, please, can you forgive me? That evil monk promised to teach me kung fu. I didn't know he's not a real monk. Abbot, now I understand what's right and what's wrong. I've learned my lesson. Abbot, please, can you teach me some kung fu? - Want to learn kung fu? But what for? Why are you so sad? What's the matter? Tell me, I'll help you. - Will you really help me? (Liu Kung grunts) Hey, no kidding? - [Liu Kung] Of course. - Well, some three years ago, it was late, nearly midnight, my dad, who was sick, had a relapse. A strange guy came to our house, said he was a doctor. He treated my dad. (melancholic instrumental music) - Doctor, what's wrong with him? (soft instrumental music) Doctor, is it serious? Please, tell me. - It's bad. - Oh, no, please, no. (gentle instrumental music) (mysterious instrumental music) How dare you speak to me that way? - Tonight, I've come to take you away! (shouting) - Oh, let me go! - Let her go, let go of her! - Get out of here, kid! Go away! - Chou Shang, Chou Shang, help me! (shouting) - You son of a bitch! - Oh, darling! - You should be in bed, you bastard. What are you doing up? - I'll kill you, you bastard! (shouting) (fleshy smack) (groaning) - Oh, oh, are you all right? - Here, get up. - [Mother] Oh, let me go, are you okay? - Let her go! - Chou Shang, help me! (shouting) Oh, are you all right? Let go of me! Oh, Chou Shang! - [Father] Let her go! - [Doctor] Get out! (groaning) - [Mother] Darling! - Let her go! - Darling! - [Chou Shang] Dad! Dad! - [Mother] Let me go. Chou Shang! - [Chou Shang] Let her go! (fleshy smacks) - [Mother] Don't hurt him! Chou Shang! - Since then, I've been wandering, searching for my mother. Also, I'm looking for my father's murderer. But, so far, I haven't found either. (gentle instrumental music) - I understand how you feel. Do you know any kung fu? - I learned some. Not so good, not like your style. - You seem determined. But it's not easy to learn. - I'm not scared. - All right. - Master, have a seat. Now then, Master, please accept my respects. (majestic instrumental music) - I warned you, you need patience. - Tell me, what style is it? - Do you want to learn? - Yes, of course. But I'm just sitting here. That's no use to me. - Oh, yes, it is. The art of kung fu is patience. First, acquire that. It allows you to express your inner energy. I know that meditation can be boring, but it's part of a kung fu expert's training. You must do it. Endure hardship, then I'll teach you practical skills. (gentle instrumental music) Chou Shang, come on, you attack me now. - You sure about that? Don't go blaming me if I hurt you. - Go ahead, attack me, if you can, using all your strength. (shouting) - Master, what style is that? - Opposing Forces, strong, weak. (shouting) More force, come on, harder. (slapping) (groaning and whimpering) - Master, what style is that called? - It's known as Force Down The Wall. Because you are small and young, you lack strength, so you must use your opponent's force. When he strikes hard, catch him off balance. (pastoral instrumental music) Chou Shang. - [Chou Shang] Master, what is it? - You've improved considerably, but you must remember, use your kung fu for self-defense. Never use it to kill. - Yes, but, I. - Listen, we must move on, can't stay here for good. Also, we must come to some agreement. - What's that? An agreement? - Yes, form tomorrow, you will accompany me, wandering for three months. If we still can't find the person you want, you must return to my temple. - If we do find him, Master, you must kill him for me. (gentle instrumental music) Master, do you agree to those terms? (Liu Kung grunts) Excellent, then let's make a deal! Here. - What for? - Save it. (gentle instrumental music) (gong rings) (brassy instrumental music) (bubbling) (gong rings) - Everything's ready now. - Go back. - Right. - Ready for inspection, sir. (grunting) - Let's start. (dramatic instrumental music) - [Guard] Stand by for inspection! The Chief is coming! The Chief is coming! The Chief is coming! (dramatic instrumental music) (shouting and chattering) - [Guard] Get out of the way! (dramatic instrumental music) (shouting) Up, out of the way, out of the way. Get up! (groaning) Out of the way! - [Citizen] Help me. - [Citizen] Oh, hello, sir. (shattering) - [Guard] Hey, you're not allowed to sell those things! (fleshy thud) (dramatic instrumental music) - Master, he's a mean-looking guy. - Not so loud, he might hear you. (fleshy thunks) (shouting) - Listen, you. You dare to disobey our orders again? - Just worshiping Buddha isn't breaking the law. - Insolent dog! (thunderous thunks) (groaning) - Master. - There's no law in this town. Don't cause trouble. (fleshy smacks) (grunting) - You dare to fight us? (fleshy smacks) (grunting and groaning) (moaning) - Mah Kil! Oh no, please, don't! - Anyone opposes our religion will end up like him! Come on! - [Guard] Let's go. - [Guard] Outta the way! - Buddha be praised. - Master, you see what they did? - Don't you get involved. - [Woman] My dear, oh, no. (weeps) (melancholic instrumental music) - Master, those members of the Yin Yang sect, they're cruel. Why didn't you try to stop them? - Because. - [Chou Shang] Because of what? - Buddhism forbids interference of other religions. - Yes, but those men are evil. - Their judgment day is near. Just forget about it. (gentle instrumental music) Think we'll stay here a while. - [Chou Shang] Right. (gentle instrumental music) (fleshy thuds) (grunts) - What style are you using? - The Ten Cat style. Not bad, eh? - Now you watch my Tai Chi style. (fleshy thuds) (grunts) - There, the place is over there. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Here. (fleshy thuds) (grunts) (chuckling) - Ah, good to see you. - Good to see you. - Hello there. - Good to see you. - Pleased to meet you. I take it that you live here? You're practicing very hard, You both seem to be good fighters. - Mister, thank you very much for the compliment. But what can we do for you? - Thank you, it's like this. The Yin Yang sect have been robbing and killing and they brutally murdered my own brother. They're corrupt and powerful. Their chief's a kung fu expert. They have to be defeated and destroyed once and for all. So I'd like your help. I can't do it alone. - Yeah, they've also been bothering us. Certainly we'll help you, Mister! (shouting) (fleshy thunks) (whimpering) - Hold it! You've gone too far this time! Do you have no respect for the law? - The law? In this place, our legend is the law. - Not for me. - Bastard! I'll kill you! (fleshy thuds) (grunts) - Look at that. - Hey, look at that. (shouting) - You're useless, watch me. (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) - [Guard] Got you now. (fleshy smacks) (grunts) - Sister Mae, careful, they'll kill you. - Don't worry. - You stay out of it! - You bullying swines. Takes so many of you to defeat a young boy? - You got a big mouth, girl. - Hey, men don't hurt this little lady. She's got some style! - Yeah. - Oh, right. - Hey, lady. (smacks and grunts) - Did she like you? - How was the lady? - You like that? - Did you like her? - What's the joke? - Want some more? (shouting) - Get them! - Oh, right. (fleshy smacks) (grunts) - Out! Go on, get out! - You'll pay for this. Come on. (groaning) - Sister Mae, those kinds of people should be punished. They don't deserve to live. - Madam, you shouldn't have fought with them in here. Think of my business. They won't come back. - [Chou Mae] Don't worry about it. I'll pay for the damage. My father's chief of Fan's village. - Well, really I shouldn't-- - Here, take this. - Oh, thank you, lady, thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. - [Chou Shang] Sister Mae, how come you're here anyway? - Some business. Come on, let's go. - Right. (throbbing instrumental music) - What are you looking for? - You go on, I'll catch up with you later. - [Innkeeper] Go on get outta here! If you haven't got any money, we don't want you around here. Go on, get away, I don't wanna see you again. - [Citizen] What do you mean? - Ah, Mistress, right inside. - There you go. - Ah, coming out! - [Innkeeper] This way. Right this way, gentlemen. Step this way. Please, come in. - Welcome. All right. - [Patron] Hey, you, you kid, what are you doing? - Looking for someone. - Oh, is that so? (laughing) - You son of a bitch, you're too young to be in here. Hey, get out! Go on, beat it, kid. You come back when you're a bit older, that's when. (laughing) - Go on, get outta here. - Ho Min Chou, come on down here, greet the customers, Chou Ho Min Chu. - Buddha be praised. You mean you want me to take you inside there? - Exactly, right inside, Master. Come on, you promised to help me. - But I'm-- - Master, help me, remember, we made a deal. - Of course I want to help you, but I'm-- - Master, if you refuse, I swear I won't get up. - [Liu Kung] Chou Shang, don't threaten me this way. Get up now. - No! Not unless you help me. (gentle instrumental music) - Please, understand, the girls in there, well, anyone can go in. Anyone, that is, except a monk. (gentle instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) - [Businessman] Mister, please. - Hey, welcome, gentlemen, you must be strangers in town. - [Businessman] Do come again. - Hey, isn't he a bit young for this place? - Hey, my elder brother brought me here. Just have a look, we've got plenty of money, so let us in. - Oh, yes, yes. - Yes, of course. - Hey, send some nice girls over. - Oh, yes, sure, right. (shouting) - [Prostitute] Oh, here, he's my type! Oh, I like him! (slow instrumental music) (shouting and chattering) Oh, he's mine! (gentle instrumental music) (chattering) Oh, don't do that! (giggling) Oh, he's so cute. - I think I'm in love with you. You're driving me crazy. (giggling) Get off! (giggling) - Stop it, ladies. I said you were to be nice to the guests. Don't overdo it. Relax, girls. (relaxing instrumental music) Mister, have some fruit. - Our manager sent the fruit personally. Something reserved for honored guests, you shouldn't refuse. - [Prostitute] Yes, that's right, come on, have some. Come on, eat. - That's right. Come on, let me serve you. Here. - Yes. - You're quite a man, different to the others, sort of virile. Haven't seen you here before. What's your name, where are you from? Mister, cat got your tongue? (grunting) Ah, I see you've a sore throat. Aw, I can soon fix that for you with some chrysanthemum tea. - Mister, I'll fix some for you. - No, you don't, I'll get it. (giggling) Mister, take it easy, I'll be back real soon. - Oh, the Mama-san fancies him. - Mister, if you're feeling hot, take your hat off. - No, no, no hat. - [Prostitute] Well, Mister, try some fruit then, come on. (giggling) - Bastard! Beat it, you little boy, huh? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - You bastard. (shouting) - Mister, chrysanthemum tea made especially for you. Get that down you, it'll do your throat a world of good. Come on, drink up. (giggling) And what's so funny? Get downstairs, all of you. It's full of customers and they need some attention. Be nice to them. Go on now. - [Prostitute] All right, I'm going. - Come on. - Okay. (women chattering) - [Prostitute] There are good men downstairs, too. - [Prostitute] Yeah, come on, let's go. - Mister, come along. Let's see you drink the tea. Drink it all up. It'll really soothe your throat. Here. Drink up. Come on, hurry up. Ah, Mister. Oh, forgive me, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spill it like that, I'm so sorry. Take your clothes off. They have to come off anyway. Ah, let me help you, come on. I'll dry them for you. Come on, I'm sorry, don't worry. I'll take care of you. (dramatic instrumental music) - Chou Shang. Chou Shang! Chou Shang! (weeping) Say "mother." Please, call me "mother!" (melancholic instrumental music) I don't blame you. I'm no good. I don't deserve a son like you! (crying) - Just tell me, who was the doctor who killed Dad? (melancholic instrumental music) - You have a right to know. I'll tell you everything. - Go on then, talk, who's he? - He's actually the owner of this brothel. Also, the chief of the Yin Yang sect. Yu Yi Yang. (melancholic instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) - Mom! Mom! (dramatic instrumental music) Mama. - Chou Shang. - Mama! Ma! (melancholic instrumental music) - Chou Shang. - Sister Mae, I know who is my father's murderer. He is Yu Yi Yang. - Yu Yi Yang? - Uh huh! - Chou Shang, come on, let's go. - You can't leave now. (dramatic instrumental music) It won't be that easy. Get them. (fleshy smacks) (grunts) - Chou Shang. (fleshy smacks) (grunts) Come on, come on. (groaning) - All right, all right, just let them go. If the townsfolk hear about what happened, they might have second thoughts about coming here, and that's no good for business. (groaning) - When will all this fighting and killing stop? - Master, you promised me. You said you would help me get revenge. - Well. - Abbot, Yu Yi Yang's gang is ruthless. We can't let them carry on with their evil ways. - You just don't understand. - The little troublemaker brought a girl along with him, did he? - That's right, they came in here, caused a lot of trouble. - I'll teach that little bastard a good lesson. (laughs) Surround the entire town! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! (dramatic instrumental music) - Oh, Abbot. - Mr. Fan. - Governor. - How are you? - Abbot, the Yin Yang sect's surrounded our town. I've sought the help of two great fighters, but we're still no match for the Yin Yang sect. Abbot, please, could we trouble you to come and help us fight them? - Governor, fighting's against Buddhist teachings. I am sorry. - Please, bend the rules a bit. This is an emergency. (dramatic instrumental music) - Who's there? - [Fighter] Hold it! - [Chou Mae] He's one of Yu Yi Yang's spies. - No, we're not. - You're lying! (fleshy smacks) (grunts) - Hold it. (fleshy smacks) (grunts) Mistress, it's a misunderstanding. - What do you mean? We caught you listening to our conversation. Why else would you eavesdrop? - Please, calm down, let me explain. Listen, we're not the Yin Yang sect. - Can you prove that? - All right! If you say you're not one of their spies, tell me, what are you doing here? - My name's Wong Han and he's my assistant Lee Yung. - Hello. - We had orders to come here and arrest the chief of the Yin Yang sect. - Then, please, forgive us. - It's all right. - That's great, now we can all fight the Yin Yang group together. - That is not an easy mission. You must be very careful. As I can see, Yu Yi Yang has mastered the art of three fist styles. They're powerful. It's not that easy to arrest him. - What shall we do then, Abbot? - I know Yu Yi Yang comes out to inspect on the 15th of each month. You should use this chance to ambush him. It's your only chance. That way you would not have to fight with all his men. (dramatic instrumental music) - You crazy bastards. Get out of my way, you've got a nerve. - Yu Yi Yang, listen I'm Mae Nang's son and today I've come for revenge. - I'm here to take revenge for my uncle, Fan Su Yung. - I've been ordered to come here and arrest you. You better give up, Yu Yi Yang. You can't escape this time. - Oh? (laughs) Why don't you all just try it? We'll see who'll be the loser. Get them. (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) (dramatic instrumental music) (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) - Sky! - And Earth! (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) (dramatic instrumental music) - You are under arrest. - Arrest? That's not all, bastard. Yu Yi Yang, I'm gonna kill you. - Start praying, you'll soon be dead. - (chuckles) We'll soon see who's gonna die. (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) - Abbot, please, don't hesitate. You must go and help them or else they'll all get killed. Abbot, we have no time. Abbot, you must help us. (fleshy smacks) (grunts and groans) (screaming) (shouting) - Please, stop. (dramatic instrumental music) Buddha be praised. - Chou Mae. - Master. - [Fan] Are you all right? - Hey! You, monk, where the hell are you from? Don't think we've met before. Better stay out of this. (suspenseful instrumental music) - [Liu Kung] Have mercy, sir. Let these people go. Stop all your fighting and killing and live in peace. We're all one big family. - Stop your goddamn preaching. - Buddha be praised. (tense instrumental music) (shouting) (fleshy smacks) (grunts) (chuckles) (fleshy smacks) (grunts) (shouts) (fleshy smacks) (grunts) (shouting) (groaning) (shouting) (tense instrumental music) Buddha be praised. - Master, you promised to help me to take revenge. - Killing doesn't help solve anything, son. Just let Wang Han handle this. He will take Yang to court. He'll be punished. (tense instrumental music) (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) (groaning) Buddha be praised. You've killed him. You feel any better for it now? (melancholic instrumental music) According to our agreement, it's now time for us to part. Take care, my son. (gentle instrumental music) - Governor, what shall I do? - That's up to you, it's your life. (gentle instrumental music) - Master! (gentle instrumental music)
