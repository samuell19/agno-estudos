(upbeat orchestral music) (typewriter clacking) (phone ringing) Hello. What? Stay right there. Hey, did Jerry call in? Not yet. Well, we are holding the front page 20 minutes and I'll just wait that long. And no longer. Say, you mean about that girl's suicide at the Regent Apartments? Yes. And in case we muff it, you get something hot. Say, I got somethin' red hot. All about that evangelist havin' a baby. All right, spin a couple columns, if you like. Yeah? This is Ed. Copy boy! Oh, is that you, Jerry? Well, where in the- Oh, you got the story, eh? Yes. Get over here just as fast as you can with them. Uh, no, no, no, wait a minute. You better give us something to start working on. Uh, dictate about 300 words. Hey, Spuds. Okay, Chief? Take Jerry on 16. Take some stuff on that girl's suicide. Oh! Hi, Jerry? Spud. Shoot. (typewriter clacking) (office workers shouting) Oh, no, no, no. Not A.H. Smith, no. J. J.H. J like in, uh, juniper berries. (giggles) Yes, that's right. Will you tell Barrows I'll be right in? It's a whale of a big story. Will you save me a coupla columns? Bye. (phone clangs) (office workers shouting) (phones ringing) A Mr. Smith's outside and wants to see you immediately. Well, send him in. Yes, sir. (man shouting) Well, a returning prodigal. Hello, Brice. What? Only hello on a nice, bright day like this? Well, I'm in a terrific hurry. Oh, gee, you look like a million in that get-up. Well, thank you, mister. Say, I heard you fell on a great story. Fell on it? Listen, I dug that up with my own little hatchet and is it swell? Love nest suicide. I've got pictures and everything, exclusive. No? And, if that doesn't get my salary boosted, oh, Brice, it's the first big scoop I've ever had. I'm just thrilled to death. You look like two million now all pepped up like that. Say, how 'bout a coupla steaks tonight to celebrate? I'll bring 'em if you broil 'em. Okay. I hope ya get your raise. Oh, listen, you wanna borrow the price of those steaks? Yeah, that wouldn't be a bad idea. I'll get the steaks. (laughs) All right, I'll bring a red. [Jerry] Bye! [Office Worker] Hello? Yeah. Say, hey! I got the whole works. I beat everybody to it, including the police. Uh, wait a moment. Come over in the corner. Secrets? Oh. Here's a picture of the girl that killed herself. And here's her Romeo. He certainly was a dirty rat. Listen to this. "I'm through with you and you might as well know it. If you wanna Kill yourself, go ahead and do it." How do ya like that? It's a swell story, huh? Well, what's the matter? Jerry, why didn't you tell me the man in this affair was John H. Smith? What difference would it make? I know it's gonna hit you pretty hard. And I feel like tearing things apart, myself. What? Your story's dead. Dead? I've just come from Barmaun's office. He killed my story? Where are you going? I'm going to see Barmaun. No, no, no. You'll get fired. Not before I tell him what I think of him. Young woman, who are you? I'm the reporter who turned in that girl's suicide story and I'm tellin' you what I think of ya for not printing it. Well, we can't print every story turned in by an irresponsible reporter. No? You go to the cashier and get your money. You're discharged. I resigned just before I came in here. (typewriters clacking) (office men shouting) (phone ringing) (doorbell ringing) (doorbell ringing) Better open that door, young lady, or I'll break it down. [Jerry] Who is it? Me with the eats. Well, you came early, didn't you? You'll have to wait now until I call. Don't come in. [Brice] All right. But you better hurry up and open up. [Jerry] All right, come on in. (door thuds) Oh, go ahead. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna ball me out, I suppose, for what I said to Barmaun. I should say I am. Probably got ya stopped by now. You know he controls every sheet in town. Oh, I guess I'm a fool, but. I was so mad. I've gotta get a job somewhere. I've just got to! [Brice] If you'd only listened to reason, why, you wouldn't have to worry about looking for a job. Oh, we've been all over that. Yeah, I know we have. S'pose it is a cock idea. Oh, Brice. Darling, I like you better than any man I ever met. But I don't wanna get married and just sit down and do nothing. Better tell me what gates I crashed in the morning. Are you really determined to keep on your own? You bet I am. Then I guess I better give ya some free advice. Ha. What? On a small paper, you'd shine like the seat of a pair of surge pants. Why don't you hit a small town? A small town? Me? Yeah, I know a man by the name of Webster who runs a paper out in Apex, California. That's where I was born. [Jerry] Oh. I can probably get you the job as Society Editor or something like that just as a starter. Me do Society on a small paper in Apex, California? Hah. I'm a swell newspaper man and I know it. Oh yeah? (chuckles) Whatcha got? Ah, some bread. Bread? That all you brought? I hope you got it sliced. What kind of a town is this, hm, Apex? Oh, it's all right if you like small towns. I mean, you know, I'd be willing to take an editor's job on a country paper. Why don't you wire him I'm on my way? Oh, you would, eh? Well, I told you before he wanted a man. Well, just wire him that, uh, Jerry Hampton is coming. See? And then I'll take care of the rest. Yeah, and the minute you got there, he'd throw ya right smack out on your ear. Well, it'd be my ear. Do you have those peas open, yet? I can't get the-(grunts). [Jerry] Hey, tell me more about this little town where you were born. Oh, well it's, according to the Chamber of Commerce, the population is about 8,000. But I think that includes mules and one-eyed jacks. Oh, Brice, will you? (laughs) Will you be serious? I mean, who? Who are the principal citizens? Things like that. Well, there's only one that I know of and that's my esteemed uncle, Mr. Martin Blake. He's the president of the Apex National Bank. And he's hard boiled and has no sympathy whatsoever for widows, children, or newspaper writers. Oh. Sounds like a nice man. Here, when you get those open, you can put 'em in there. What's the owner of the paper like? (car accelerating) (car engine revving) Is this the Advocate office? Well, sure, don't ya see the sign? Well, I hoped it was a typographical error. Huh? Oh no, it's been there for 35 years. (bag thuds) Is there something I can do for you? Well, I wanted to see Mr. Webster. Well, if you have a piece for the paper, I'm the. Society Editor. No, it's business. Oh. I guess you can see him. He's in his office. (heels clacking) Mr. Webster? There's somebody to see you. Oh. Won't you come in? You wanna see me, young lady? Won't you sit down? Thank you. (trunk thuds) What can I do for you? Mr. Webster, I'm Miss Hampton. Hampton? Hm. I'm afraid I don't just recall the name. Why didn't Brice Regal wire you that I was coming? Jerry Hampton? Jerry Hampton? Why, yes, about the editorship, you know. Oh, well. (Stammers) You're a girl. But didn't he tell you in his wire? No. No, he might have known I wouldn't want a girl around here. I'll, uh, I'll give you a check for your expenses. I suppose you wouldn't consider employing a woman even though she were the best editor in the world. Heh. Who says you're the best editor in the world? I do. Well, that certainly is interesting. No. No, you're too pretty to be smart. I'd like that a lot if I weren't looking for a job. I think I know why you want an editor. They're drilling for oil around here and if the wells come in, you'll have a boom town. I don't put much stock in that oil well. No, just a wildcat. Hundred to one, they won't hit oil. You want an editor anyway, don't you? Well, I. I'm about ready to quit. I'm old and. I'm tired. And I wanted a young fella to come out here and take the burden off of me. 'Course that's why I can't have a girl around here. Now, how much were your expenses? I don't want expense money. I want a job. I've told you I can run a newspaper and so has Brice Regal. Now, being a girl is just an accident that I can't help. But I'm here and I'm ready to go to work. Now, do I get the job or not? [Mr. Webster] Well, now- - Think twice before you speak. Because if you say anything but yes, the best editor you ever saw is gonna walk right out of this office and never come back. (chuckles) (sighs) Shake. You're going to be the editor for one month, anyway. Your salary's 35 dollars a week, okay? Thanks a lot. A month is plenty of time to prove that you can't possibly get along without me. (chuckles) You've got determination, Jerry. And that's half the newspaper business. Come on outside and I'll introduce you to your staff. Now, this is your staff. Mrs. Mellum. I want you to meet your new Editor. This is Jerry Hampton. And Mrs. Mellum is the Society Editor. Now, how do you do? And Ash? Yeah? I want you to meet your new Editor. This is Ash. He is the Advertising Department. Oh. And, uh. This is... Where is Bill? (glass squeaking) Oh, uh, Bill? Bill? Yeah, come here, Bill, I want you to meet your new Editor. This is Bill Giddings. He runs the Sports Department and edits a column called. "Over the Transom". Are there many transoms in Apex? Well, I must say most of 'em have been nailed shut since I started my column. Did you say the name was Giddy? No, no. The name. That's how I am. The name is Giddingzz. Giddingzzuh. As in the flight of a bumblebee. A zzzuh. Oh. (Chuckles) You wash windows in between time. Oh, well, I don't know. I just sort of do that to- Kinda helps keep my figure. If I'm not boasting. See, I play croquet. Captain. And I feel I don't get quite enough exercise. Oh, yes. Well, I should think if you're column was hot enough, it'd keep you busy running from the people you write about. Hot, my column? Oh, for heaven's sake. Just draw up a chair and I will give you a sample. Now, what well-known paper hanger is running around with what cute little blonde? Just mull that around a bit. Try to guess that one. Well, I was never very good at riddles. You better tell me. Well, it's his wife's baby. (chuckles) Get it? Oh, yes. I've heard worse, but I don't remember where. Yeah. Well, speaking of New York. If they ever hear about me in New York. (scoffs) Oo, they'll send for me. Why, they're all asleep there. They've no idea that newspaper men are born and not made. Oh, I'll say newspaper men are born. Some of them, prematurely. Now, I, myself. I am an incubator baby. No. Oh, did you say the name was Giddy? No, no, Giddingzzuh. Zzuh. Mr. Webster, I think you have a very efficient staff. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't make a great success of the Advocate. (typewriter clacking) (paper tearing) (wheel rattling) Oh, Luke, I wanna talk to you about some changes in the makeup. I'll use a banner and we'll get in some two-column heads. You see what else you can find. Sure, Miss Hampton, I'll run through and see what display type I can dig up. All right. Thanks, Luke, but the name is Jerry. All right. Jerry. Goodnight. Goodnight, Luke. Goodnight. (door thuds) I guess you might as well know all about this town. You know, I think Martin Blake lent his name to that oil well just to sell stock. But, nearly everyone I talk to has money in it. Ah, that's the point. If Blake thought there was the slightest chance of hittin' oil, he'd a-gobbled up all that stock himself. Well, if you have no faith in the well, then just what is the attitude of the paper toward it? Well. You see. I owe Blake some money. Oh. And, uh, I can't afford to antagonize him. He's kinda got a mortgage on this place here. Well. Here I am, right up to my neck in a movie. Mortgage on the ol' homestead and everything. Honest publisher faces ruin and his children are starving. Well, but I'm not married. But your children are starving anyway. Huh? All hope is lost. There's nothing left but the river. Do you know what happens? What, what? The bright, young female editor drives up the circulation, fills the paper with advertising. Yeah? The publisher is able to pay off the banker and tell him to go to He- (Mr. Webster laughing loudly) (stomps foot) See, that's a funny. See, you've earned your salary already. (laughing loudly) I haven't laughed like this for four or five years. Well, I think I'll go home and get some sleep, so I can pitch in tomorrah. You know, I think I'm gonna like it here a lot. Well, I hope you do, Jerry. (typewriter clacking) Well, this is certainly gonna start some row. [Jerry] What's going to start a row? [Ash] Well, this story about Arthur Young's divorce. What's wrong with it? Oh, nothing. Only he's Nate Young's brother. And Nate Young owns the white front department store. You may not know it, but his advertising just about keeps this sheet alive. Well, you just leave the advertisers to me, will you? Say, when I go out to drum up a little business, all I get's a poke in the eye with a dirty stick. [Nate Young] Nobody can say a thing like that about a member of my family and get away with it. Say, where is this Jerry Hampton? You tell him that Nathan Young wants to talk to him. Would you kindly step into the Editorial Office? (Bill exhales loudly) Just what was it you wanted to talk about? My business is with Jerry Hampton, miss, and I don't wanna talk to you about it. I'm afraid you'll have to. You see, I'm Jerry Hampton. Who, you? You Jerry Hampton? My, my. What busy businessman is ready to slay what newspaper editor? Hot news, hot news. (car engine puffing) (door slams) I'm just going in to get a cigar. Don't wait for me. (car engine accelerating) - Oh, hello, Sam. - Hello, Mart. Have a cigar? No thanks, I'm just going in to get one. Oh, by the way. This new editor of yours. Do you think it's wise to increase your expenses? Well, I been kinda gettin' ready for that oil well when it comes in, Mart. Apex is gonna boom and I don't wanna miss any tricks. Now I've told everybody in this town that that well is just a gamble. They all seem to think they're gonna be millionaires. Well, I s'pose they think anything that you're in, Mart, can't be much of a gamble. (Chuckles) Uh, this editor, he's a young fellow, isn't he? (stammering) Yes, yes, he's kinda young. Kinda young. Knows all about newspaper business. Made a lot of improvements on the paper already. Yes, I've noticed that. Yeah, well I've got to be toddlin' along. So long, Mart. Goodbye, Sam. Well being a woman doesn't excuse you from printing objectionable articles about a member of my family. Oh, you mean your brother's divorce? You had no right to print anything about my family's affairs or experiences without my personal permission. Mr. Young, do you think I'm going to let you run this paper for me? Hey. Nate Young came in loaded for bear. She took him in her private office. You better hurry in there before she loses our biggest advertiser for you. Well, what's it all about? Arthur Young's divorce. I'm sorry, but, I can't see things your way. Well, if that's your attitude, you'll never get another cents worth of advertising from me. Well this really simplifies matters. You see. Up 'til now, we haven't accepted any mail-order advertising. 'Cause we don't like to see money spent outside of Apex. It isn't good for local business. Of course, a newspaper has to have advertising to live. Oh, Giddy? She means me. Right here, Miss Hampton. Would you wire Mirror Starbucks that it's okay to send copies of their ad? Have Ash wire Mayor Starbucks. Steer Marbuck? Whatever it is, they shall be wired. Send a wire to Mayor Star- Send a wire. Say, is Mirrors and Starbucks gonna advertise in this town? Well, you just heard me accept their order. Oh, that'll never do. Why, that'll cut into my business. I can't stand mail-order competition. Send a wire to Beers and Marstuck. What about? (sighs) Well, as a matter-of-fact, it's slipped my mind. I'll find out. Anyway. I haven't definitely decided to take my advertising away from the paper, yet. Besides, I think you oughta give me a chance to, sorta, change my mind. Well, you see. You only run a quarter of a page every other day and, well, the smallest mail-order contract would be several full pages a week. Say, if Mirrors and Starbucks thinks this town is worth that much to them, it's worth that much to me. Of course, without any mail-order competition. Well, I don't know. Aw, come on now. Give us a chance. The home people, you know. Please, give us a chance? I might make it a little bit more. Well, I'll see Mr. Webster, but I think that'll be fine, Mr. Young. All right, all right. We'd have it in on tomorrow's news truck. Well, we'll try it for a month, anyway. Well, it's a real pleasure to have met you, Miss Hampton. I'll bring over the copy for the first page tomorrow, and, maybe you can offer some suggestions. Well, I'll try. Thank you, thank you very much. Goodbye. (whistling joyfully) Say, nevermind about that wire, Giddy. Zzzuh. Oh, yes, of course. Well, we won't have to worry about Mr. Nathan Young anymore. Jerry, if you'da lost Nate's advertisin', we couldn't of kept on puttin' out the paper. Well, we won't stop for a couple of weeks, anyway. (Mr. Webster sighs) Printer that to the loan to Mr. Webster. Yes, sir. Well, Sam, I'm glad to see your catching up on your back payments. Yes, so am I. (laughs) They tell me this new girl editor of yours is pretty smart. Smart? Say. (Fingers snap) She's just like that. Why, in less than six months, I'll have you all paid off and out of debt. Ah, that'll be a novelty. Yes, won't it? And, say, did you hear about Nate Young comin' into the office to beat her up before he knew she was a girl? (laughing) [Martin Blake] Yes, yes, I know all about it. You do? Who told ya? [Martin Blake] You did. Last time you were in. Oh. And three times before that. [Mr. Webster] Oh. And I also know that my nephew, Brice, sent her down from the city. Ah. [Martin Blake] You told me that at least ten times. Well, I guess I'll be going. (chuckles) So, she had an argument with Nate Young, eh? Tried to teach him a lesson. Yeah. Now he's tryin' to teach her a lesson. Oh. Yeah, just took her for an auto ride. (chuckles) So long, Mart. (typewriter keys clacking) Ah, Rigby. Get me a complete statement of Webster's account. Showing the amount of his payments and the balance he still owes. Yes, sir. And, also a complete list of his bank deposits since he got his new editor. Yes, Mr. Blake. (typewriter clacking) [Nate Young] Now, right down there. That's where my great grandfather's cabin stood in pioneer days. Oh, they fought Indians all around here. Indians? Oh, yes. Yeah. And, right here where we are now, on this very hill, this is where a stockade stood. Oh, not this hill? This very hill. What, really? Mmhm. And in one battle here, my great aunt, Libby Rogers, she shot six Indians, herself. Then she scalped 'em. What, she scalped all six of 'em? All six of 'em. Well. We had the scalps in the family when I was little, but the moths got into them and all the hair fell out. Oh, what a misfortune. It sure was. Gee, I wish I could've shown 'em to you. I'd love to have seen them. Oh, Nate, I've got to be getting back to the office if I'm gonna get a paper out today. (car accelerating) (car engine accelerating) (Jerry shrieks) Who was that? That was John Levings from over at the oil well. Another couple of inches and he'da hit me. Let's go, Nate. Sure, you bet. (car engine accelerating) (brakes squeak) Thanks for the ride, Nate. And all the information. I feel almost like a pioneer now, myself. You know, I was gonna ask you a question today, but I. (Chuckles) I just couldn't get up my nerve. Oh, please don't ask me anything I'll have to say no to, will you? I guess I wouldn't have much of a chance, anyway. (sighs) Goodbye. Goodbye, Nate. (heels clicking) (table thuds) [Brice] Jerry! Brice! You darling! Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Yeah, I'm glad to see you, too. [Jerry] You don't know how much I've missed you. How's Spud and Hank and all of them? Oh, never mind that, I wanna talk about you. Listen, come on in, give me a lowdown on everything. We just got time for a little. Sit down. Oh, you. You're real, aren't you, darling? I'm not just dreaming or anything? Well, if you don't believe I'm alive, just pinch me and see if I don't wake up. Oh! (both giggling) How is Sam and? Oh, everything's wonderful. I've run up the circulation nearly 800. Most of it in the last two weeks. Is it? And nearly twice as much advertising. Can you imagine the kick I get out of seeing it grow and realizing I'm doing it all by myself? I'll bet Sam"s tickled to death. Tickled? You should've seen him when I first came here. He was tired and ready to quit. Then to see him wake up and take an interest in things. And to realize I'm responsible for that, too. You know, he wanted a newspaper and I'm giving it to him. I love that old man, Brice. Attagirl, I knew you could do it. (Sam whistling) [Ed] Hello there, Sam. Hello, Ed, how are ya? How's the boy? (men laughing) I thought you were comin' back and ask me to marry ya. Not that I would or anything. [Mr. Webster] Well, I sworn. Sam. Well, well, why didn't you let a fellow know so? We coulda got out the band? Well, I didn't know it myself. I just came. Sit down, sit down. Gosh, it's great to see you again, Sam. Ah, it's great to see me? Yeah, I guess this is what you've come to see? Maybe. I wouldn't say. Has she told you what happened? Well, she's been braggin' a lot. I don't know how much of it is true. Oh ho, say she's the smartest thing this side of anywhere. Oh is that so? Well, she doesn't look so intelligent to me. - Yeah? - Oh. (all chuckling) I want to see Miss Hampton. Say I'll only keep her a minute. I'll see if she's busy. The name is Levings? That's right. John Levings. (Sam chuckling) Oh, would you pardon me just a minute? Tell me, how's old New York? You want to see me? I just dropped in to give you a little news. We've closed down the well. We didn't find any oil. You mean, the well has failed? [John Levings] I'm afraid that's right. Well, this is very important news. Would you come in and give me a full report? I haven't time right now, but here's a statement. It will explain everything. But I'd like an interview. Lots of people in town have money invested. You see, this is of vital importance. It's all in there. I'm sorry I can't stop now. Later, perhaps. Oh, but Mr. Levings- - [John Levings] I'm sorry. (shoes clicking) Did he say the oil well had failed? Yes. Oh. (Sobs) What? Did you have money in it? I put in all my savings. Every cent. So did the maid at the hotel. And the station taxi driver. A lot of others who couldn't afford to lose. (Mrs. Mullen sobbing) Oh, why don't you go home and rest awhile? Try not to think too much about it. And don't say anything to anyone until I know more? If you say so. (whimpers) (footsteps thudding) All right, 6:30. Well, you're dated up with dinner tonight at Uncle Mart's, So you better run home and put on that other dress. I can't go to dinner tonight. Why? The oil well failed. Failed? Yes, they're closing down. This is the statement that Levings just left me. Oil well? [Mr. Webster] Yes, it's on West Hill. Your uncle was interested in it. [Brice] Well, if he had any money in it, he'll probably kill himself. He's such a good loser. (papers rustling) I think I will accept that dinner invitation. I might be able to get a statement from your uncle about the well. A statement? No, it's the free feed you're lookin' for. What time is dinner? 6:30 and you better not be late. All right, you call for me at the hotel at 6. Now, get out and let me get some work done. Ah, the real newspaper editor, eh? Goodbye. There's somethin" funny about this. Funny? (soft piano music) Oh, Brice. Have a cigar. [Brice] What, only one? You know, I don't know when I've adored a dinner more. I've been having my meals in hotels and cafés, it seems, for ages. She means hash houses and beaneries. That word café is something she's picked up since she's been an editor. I must say that you don't look old enough to be the editor of a newspaper. Seems to me as if you oughta be playing with paper dolls. [Brice] Don't let appearances deceive you, Uncle Mart. You'll pull back her hair just a little bit, you'll notice a scar where she had her face lifted. (all chuckling) Brice. [Maid] A sugar, Miss Hampton? Yes, one please. [Brice] Four for me. Not four lumps? Now, look here, Aunt Emma. I know people who don't take any sugar at all and I don't raise a holler about it. But the minute I ask for four, everybody goes into spasms and things. (laughing) I should think they would. Oh, just to prove that I'm a sure enough editor, will you give me an interview? Oh, what about? Mr. Levings was in today about the oil well. Hm. Yes, yes. Ah, that was very unfortunate. You know if Levings had really struck oil, it would have been a big thing for Apex. 'Course that was my real reason for becoming connected with the project. Well, just what was your connection with it? That is, if you don't mind. Oh, no, no. Not at all. I was merely the banker who was handling the funds that some Eastern people had put into it. 'Course I had some money of my own invested, but I could afford to lose that. Mr. Levings left a statement at the office today. Of course, you read it? No, no. He came into the bank yesterday to ask my advice and I told him to take the bull by the horns. To give the news to your paper. Levings is the responsible party. He's in charge of everything. Now, if you'll excuse me. [Jerry] It's a wonderful old painting. Oh yes, yes. It's been in the family for a good many years. Is the interview over? Well, there's just one question I hesitate about asking. Quite a number of people bought stock in the company. Some, I suppose, because you were connected with it. I wondered if you might have something to say to them. I've been wondering whether I couldn't take over that stock for a little part of its purchase price. So that the stockholders won't lose all of their investment. Well, I think that's splendid. May I print what you just said? [Martin Blake] Oh, not just yet. I must have time to think it over. Oh, of course. Oh, gracious, I must get back to the office. Brice, would you get my wrap? I'm sorry to have to eat and run, but I'm a working girl. Well, you're not gonna work tonight. Well, if Apex is to have a paper in the morning. Thank you. Well, I always say early to bed, early to rise. Now, don't give her that kind of advice. She's wise enough now with the sleep that she gets. (Aunt Emma laughing) Well she must come again real soon. [Jerry] Goodnight. [Aunt Emma] Goodnight. Well, thanks so much for the interview. May I say that you're trying to work out a way to trade some of the loss? Well, I don't suppose it would do any harm. Oh, thanks so much for everything. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Please don't come in. I'll never get any work done. Oh, but, Jerry, I haven't seen ya but a minute tonight. You know, I didn't realize how I'd fallen for ya until after you'd gone away. What I should have done was drag you down to that license bureau the day you got fired. I've got a lot to do. Yes, I forgot I was holding up the parade. Well, good luck on the story. Thanks, Brice. I mean that. Goodnight. Goodnight. (door slams) New York calling. Hello, hello. Oh my, my, my. What's the matter? Did I frighten ya, Giddy? No, the name is not Giddy. I know! It's spelt with a Z like in wasp. Yeah. Oh, speaking of wasps. Now, wait a minute. Wait'll the folks in the morning get a load of this? What big chiseler spent all afternoon with a certain young widow? Know the answer? Mm, no. You better tell me, though, so I won't stay awake all night. The guy who makes tombstones. Oh, you idiot. Well, it's an idea, you know. I'm hard pressed for work. Sometimes, you'll say most anything to... (groans) I'm so glad you're here. Why, what's the matter? Anything wrong? Just tell me. Would Martin Blake by back stock in that oil company just to do the people in this town a good turn? Blake buy back stock, why? Yes, I mean, would he take back worthless stock, at any figure, just to keep the investors in that company from losing everything? Not if I know Martin Blake. Uh huh. He almost had me fooled tonight. That well isn't a failure. What? They've struck oil. Struck oil? Are you sure? Yes. And they're trying to pull a raw deal on all the people that put money into it. Main one two seven. I was out at the well this afternoon. Hello, Palace Hotel? Well, would you ring Mr. Levings' room please? Now, Jerry, don't do anything to antagonize Blake. I haven't told ya- - Listen, I've got Blake's number, too. Hello. Mr. Levings? Mr. Levings, this is Miss Hampton of the Advocate. It's very important that you come over to the office right away. Now, Jerry. It is important. I'm afraid I can't tell you over the phone. Well, I'm sure you'd much rather have me explain it to you, personally. Well, thanks a lot. I can expect you? Fine. Oh now, Jerry. Don't you worry. I'm not gonna fumble this. I've gotten away with a good deal so far, haven't I? Yes, you sure have, Jerry. All right, I'm gonna tie this all right on Mr. Levings with a nice little bow. Ooh, I've got to get Nate Young over here. Main two eight two. You sure you haven't made that too strong? Oh no, it's all right. There he is now. Bill, hurry, Bill. What's this all about, Miss Hampton? Won't you come in? Sit down. Well, I haven't got much time. Well, I think you'd be much more comfortable sitting. Well, what is it? I'm going to give you a chance to change that statement you gave me about the oil well. [Mr. Levings] Change it? You said the well was a failure. [Mr. Levings] What do you mean by that? I was off to the well this afternoon. I started to light a cigarette and one of your laborers nearly fainted. Just what are you getting at? There were gas bubbles in the pumps. And the pumps were going. That means you were mudding down the pressure to keep the well from blowing in. That well is a failure and we're gonna close it down. Mr. Levings, I was born practically under an oil well in Pennsylvania. First thing I smelled when I came into the world was crude oil. But never anything as crude as this. Don't you think you'd better admit it? Won't admit anything. That well is a failure. Just a moment, please. I was talking to the farmers today out at the well and found you've been buying up land in your own name. You've been double-crossing everybody, including Martin Blake. Double-crossing him? Why, Martin Blake- - Oh, don't say anything you'll be sorry for. This is the headline we intend running on the paper tomorrow. Now, you don't have to admit anything if you don't want to. But this is the banner line for the Advocate tomorrow morning. I'm giving you a chance to change your statement. Either that, or we print this proof and your statement, too. [Nate Young] I came as soon as I could. Oh, Nate, will you tell Mr. Levings what we saw at the oil well today. Sure. Right on the spot where my grand uncle, Jeremiah Young, was surrounded by a band of 30 Indians- - Nate, please, about the well. Well. If anybody tells you that that well is a failure. All right. What do you want? Just a statement of what you think the output will be and when you will start swabbing. I'll see Blake. Oh Bill. File a hundred words to the associated press. Tell them we've struck oil here and that Martin Blake, prominent Apex banker, is interested in the company. Oh boy. (oil surging) (crowd cheering) (telegraph clicking) (inaudible) (crowd chattering) (car engine puttering) Do you realize you're worth a hundred thousand dollars? Well, I don't care. I don't care for the money. Why, you'll get used to it. Well, no I won't. All these servants and all this money frighten me. You've only got a few years to live- - Well, but I wanna live happy. I don't wanna live in that big house. I wanna do my own wash and my own cooking and my own ironing and everything. Jimmy! Yes, mom? [Mother] Don't play with them kids. Their family don't own no oil stock. You come up here. (car engine puttering) Here are your corrections. And I wish you'd speed up on everything. We'll have to print 12 pages today. Can't make it. I've got everybody sweatin' now. Why, that old press is stuck together with chewin' gum. She laid down on me five times last night. (sighs) Well. We'll just have to make Mr. Webster get some new equipment somehow. (printer chuckles) Do the best you can, won't you? Yes, missy. Hey, how you makin' on that? [Worker] I'm good. Good. Will you cut down everything? The press room's swamped. How'd you make out with Sam? Oh, he just keeps saying he won't bite off more than he could chew. I think he's still afraid to take a chance. Well how does he expect to get a newspaper out if he hasn't got the proper equipment? Okay, I'll cut out all I can. (door thuds) (typewriter winding) (typewriter keys clacking) Well, here we are. Everything cut to the eyelashes. I hope you like 'em. Oh, you're sweet, Brice. To stay here and help me when you oughta be back on your own job. You know why I am staying, don't you? I know, darling, but. You know, when I get married, I want a home. I wanna stay in it. And I wanna be the one to get you that home for you to stay in it. You're sweet. Everything's goin' fine, isn't it? (Laughs) (Brice whistling) Hiya, Sam. Oh, Mr. Webster. I've gotta talk to you about getting more equipment for the office. Oh, what's a matter? Maybe you'd better come in my office a minute. But. Are you ill? No. No, I'm all right. What's the matter? Jerry. I'm gonna lose the Advocate. Lose the Advocate? How? Blake's taking it over. Blake? I just come from the bank. That's why I didn't wanna spend anymore money on equipment. I was tryin' to pay him off. But he can't take your paper without going to court no matter how much you owe him. Don't you worry. We'll raise the money. Oh, yes he can. He can take it, all right. It belongs to him. Belongs to him? Well, you see when I had to have more money to keep going, Blake made me give him a bill of sale for everything here. I been kinda paying him back. But, you'll be all right. I'll be all right? Yeah, he told me to tell ya that he wanted ya to keep on workin' for him. As if I'd work for him. I'd starve to death first. Well, he'd give ya everything you want. You won't have to worry about equipment. And don't you worry about me. I'll be all right. Why. I been kinda wantin' to retire right along. But I. I didn't wanna lose my paper. I Kinda wanted to just sit back and watch you make things hum. Hm. Oh, if only had some proof that he knew about that oil well. Wait. (door thuds) Listen, Brice. (door thuds) Oh, something terrible has happened. You've got to help me. What is it? Your uncle intends to take the Advocate away from Mr. Webster. Oh, sure, I knew about it. You. You knew it? Yeah, I intended telling you about it. It'll be a great break for you. Uncle Mart said he's gonna put in soon on the presses right away. And at least an AP wire. Why, you'll be an editor of a real newspaper. Oh, listen, Brice, Sam Webster's nursed this paper along for 30 years. And to lose it now just when it's about to amount to something? Don't you understand what that'll mean to him? Oh, Sam will be all right. Uncle Mart will take care of him. You think he'd want anybody to take care of him? Listen, dear, aren't you letting sentiment run away with ya? Sam isn't going to suffer at all. Uncle Mart is within his rights. He's offered me the job of managing the paper and he wants you to continue as the editor. Now, ain't that somethin'? I didn't know that. Well, that's what I was going to tell ya right along. Isn't that a great break of luck? You and I can be married. Yes, we could, couldn't we? Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I know you care an awful lot about Sam and so do I. Listen, I'm gonna tell you something. Your uncle new that Levings had struck oil the night we went there for dinner. He was mixed up in Levings oil well scheme and now he's trying to free Sam out of the Advocate. Oh, now that's a wild idea. You're just excited about everything, that's all. Won't you please speak to your uncle? What good would it do? Listen, Jerry, honey. This means everything to you and me. A big future. Where together we can make the Advocate the biggest paper in the West. I can't leave Sam now. Not when he needs me. Oh, you've been sweet helping me. Good luck when you take over the management. Please tell your uncle that I couldn't continue as editor under any circumstances. Jerry. Do you mean that? Well, we just don't see things the same way. I'll be leaving the day you- He takes over the paper. All right. If that's the way you feel about it. All right. (door slams) (crowd chattering) Do you know who that is? No. Why, that's Mrs. Mullen. She's made over a hundred thousand dollars on oil. Oh, uh, you may return for me at the usual time, Carlton. Yes, ma'am. How do you do, Mr. Jones? And, Mary, how are you? (crowd shouting) (crowd cheering) (crowd chattering) Nevermind, lady. I want you to request that statement. Will you change my order, please? The lady's next. I wanna change my address. I'm moving to my new house tomorrow. I've got three wells on my property and they're sinking another one next week. Yeah, well I've only got two wells on my property, but I'm drilling out 5,000 a day. I shouldn't worry. Didn't you have any sort of written agreement about your right to buy the paper back again? Well. Blake dictated and I had to accept or go into bankruptcy. And that'd left my creditors holdin' the bag. Isn't there anything we can do? I'm afraid not. Blake doesn't make many mistakes when he goes into anything. I guess he'll be in to take over everything tomorrow. Well, there's no use cryin' over spilled milk. I'm awful sorry about this, Sam, but I don't see a single thing you can do about it. Hello, Nate, old boy, how are ya? Well, gee, I'm glad to see you too. See, I'm in an awful hurry. Come in the store sometime. Come in the store. All right, I'll do. How much is this gonna cost me? Well, let me add it up and see. (knocking thuds) Come in. Oh, Nate, I'm awfully busy. Jerry, I don't like to disturb you, but this is awfully important. At least to me. What is it? Jerry. You know that my family's been right here ever since this town was started. - Long before it. - I know that this oil is bathed in their blood, plus that of the Indians. Sure. Why, my great grand uncle, Limial Young, was the first one to start a store here- - Will you leave out the family history and come to the point. Well. I might have to sell my store. You might have to sell? Yeah. Is Martin Blake trying to buy you out, too? Martin Blake? Yeah. Why, I never thought of him. But this man I mean is stopping over at Martin Blake's house. He came into my store last week and he made me an offer. And I refused it. And then he came in today and he threatened to build right next store to me and undersell me until he forced me outta business, if I didn't accept his terms. Oh, Nate, for Pete's sakes, who came into town? Who's trying to buy you out? What is it? Why John H. Smith. Who? Who? John H. Smith. The big chain store man. He came from Apex, originally. Only he didn't come from one of the old families. He's mixed up with Blake and this oil well. And I think Levings is his brother-in-law. John H. Smith is mixed up with Blake and the oil wells. He's put money up- - Yeah. Behind it. Yeah. And Levings is his brother-in-law? Yeah. Oh, Nate. Nate! (drawer rattling) This here's a chance. Chance for what? Oh, if I can only swing this. Swing what? Nate. You wait. You wait here a minute. (door thuds) Luke, put this in seven column banner head and set it 12 point black face right away. I'll give you some more copy in a minute. We're getting out an Extra. Get ready for an Extra, boys. Hurry up, get that banner head 12 point, black face. Quick! Listen. Make this snappy, boys. Be as important as you can about it. We gotta get this out. (printing press whirring) Extra, extra! Extra cover! [Boys] Extra, extra! (men shouting) Hey, boys. [Boys] Extra, extra! Extra, extra! (car accelerating) (crowd shouting) Extra, extra! (doorbell ringing) Blake. Get a load of this. What's happened? Plenty. My name in it? No. I'm the goat. Listen to this. "Levings claimed well failure after striking oil. Driller made false statement to Advocate. After four months continuous drilling, I have reported to the directors of the Apex Oil Company that, in my opinion, based upon fifteen years experience in the oil business, that this project is a failure." Well, that can't do any real harm if it doesn't mention Blake or me. It can't, eh? Well, it makes me out a crook to everybody in this town. And a fool, besides. Is Mr. Blake at home? Oh, yes, miss, he's in the living room. What is it you want coming here? I wanna see Mr. Smith, among other things. Did you ever write a letter that began like this? "I'm through with you and you might as well know it. If you wanna Kill yourself, go ahead and do it." What are you driving at? Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Well... Explain what you mean by coming here like this? Keep your hands to yourself, Blake. I think Mr. Smith knows what I mean. I was the reporter who turned in the story of Maude Kinel's death. You had Ike Bauaman Kill it. But maybe you didn't get all your letters back? I think, Mr. Blake, that you'll be interested in this, too. This is a proof of the second Extra we intend running tonight. Here you are. And once you get that set, come back for another arm full. Here's yours. And I wish every one of you was twins. Nate, you'd better read it to them. I don't imagine they're seeing any too well. "Smith, chain store magnet, named in girl's death. Girl advised in heartless letters to take own life." Give me that lock up furniture. Now read the headlines about Blake. "Banker's connection with oil plot exposed. Levings' statement prepared by bank. Blake planned to defraud stockholders." Well. (Laughs) I've got company. (printing press whirring) Well, you haven't any proof of this. Levings' statement was written on bank stationary. That'll be proof enough for anyone. Besides, I don't think Mr. Levings wants to take all the blame alone. You bet your life, I don't. Well, you can't print that. It'll go all over the country. I'll be absolutely ruined. I thought you'd feel that way about it. That's why I made you a member of the family. Of course, it's all up to Mr. Blake. What do you mean it's up to me? I'm willing to kill these stories for a consideration. [Both] How much? Oh, not for money. (printing press whirring) This is an agreement not to open a John H. Smith store in Apex. And this is a bill of sale, transferring the Advocate back to Webster. There's a check inside for what he owes you. It came outta Gertie Mullen's profits from the oil well. Now, you sign those and we won't run the Extras. Don't let her make a fool of you. All right, gentlemen, Luke Collins had instructions to start the presses at 8:30, unless I telephone. The boys should be on the streets in fifteen minutes. Why, you don't dare print that stuff. Let's wait fifteen minutes and see. [Paperboy] Extra!! Extra! [Jerry] It's still the first Extra. You won't hear the second for ten minutes. Now, look here- - To be exact, 11 minutes and a half. Do you mind? Main seven one two. I'm just calling the office to see everything's running all right. Hello, Luke? This is Jerry. Oh you have? Yes, I can hear them running. Hold the line. 'Fraid you haven't much time, Mr. Blake. The press is running. (printing press whirring) Stop those presses. This is Martin Blake speaking. Nevermind that, Luke. I'm running the Advocate until tomorrow morning. Well? (printing press whirring) (paper rustling) (pen scratching) Okay, Luke. Stop the press and kill everything. Go ahead with the regular morning run. Oh yes, will you tell Sam to wait? I'll be right over. (phone thuds) We've got the Advocate back again. Look at that. What is it? It's a bill of sale from Martin Blake. The paper's yours again. But, but. It's a long story. I'll tell ya after I get the paper ready to go to print. Say, and you better go in your office. You've got a caller in there. He's missed two trains already waitin' for ya. (gasps) It's Brice. He stayed! Ain't ya gonna hug me too? Oh, you. (door thuds) Oh, darling. Everything's all right. Including my not going away? Oh, especially that. I've got a big job for you here on the paper. Does that, by any chance, include being a husband? Well, that's part of it. And the rest? Well, we're go into that later. Hm. (upbeat orchestral music)
