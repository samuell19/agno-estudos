(funky upbeat music) - [Announcer] The 2014 FIFA World Cup welcomed the world to Brazil, a country that lives and breathes football. 12 stadiums played host to the beautiful game and on the menu, goals, and lots of them. This was a world cup with no shortage of spectacular strikes and now we'll take you on a journey to the final, to relive the highs and lows of the 32 teams battling for the biggest prize in world football. The new talent, the emotion, and the sheer incredible. You'll see it all here on Goals from the 2014 FIFA World Cup. - [Announcer] 32 teams competed in eight groups in the finals, with the first two from each going through to the last 16. Hotly fancied host, Brazil, kicked off proceedings in Group A, where they were joined by Croatia, Mexico, and Cameroon. And so to the opening game of the 2014 FIFA World Cup where a packed Maracana greeted the host Brazil and Croatia, the weight of the world on the shoulders of the Seleção. - [Commentator] Olic with the advancement, and it is an own goal, I think it's gone in and Croatia have the lead, the final touch of Marcelo, and what a shocker for the Brazilian defense. Olic presented the initial danger but nobody could've foreseen an own goal to be the first goal of the 2014 World Cup Finals. No free kick and Brazil unable to retain the possession, though Oscar has it back again for them. Little flick through here, three Brazilians forward, it is Neymar, is this his moment? Neymar, equalizes for Brazil. (fans cheering) It's the golden moment from the golden boy that Brazil celebrates expectedly. Oh, it's a good ball in, the turn and the shot here may be, a penalty kick, a penalty kick for Brazil. The Japanese referee stares at the spot, the Croats are infuriated by this. You feel it is a critical moment in the match, right on the 70-minute mark, Kaka wants a picture of it. Time to stand up, Neymar. And yeah, he is the man but only just. The fingers of Pletikosa almost denied him the glory. It's Oscar driving at the heart of the defense, Oscar, can he finish the day? Oscar's the name, he's won an Oscar. Brazil have won the match. It's three goals to one. - [Announcer] From one sellout stadium to another, the heavy rain didn't dampen the spirits of fans in Natal for the second game in Group A, where Mexico faced Cameroon. - [Commentator] Herrera, and again, slipped through for dos Santos, and again. (fans cheering) Mexico finally break through, Peralta's the man. - [Announcer] Mexico we're back in action in the next Group A clash, this time facing Brazil for a heated Latin American duel in Fortaleza. - [Commentator] Pressure still on, Dani Alves towards Neymar, good jump, oh, what a save, what a save by Ochoa. That is brilliant. Neymar thought he'd scored, most in the stadium thought he'd scored. All lined up on the edge of the six-yard box as the cross goes in, oh, it's another wonderful save. Ochoa once more. - [Announcer] After their opening game defeat, Cameroon and Croatia played each other with both teams in desperate need of points to have any hope of progressing to the last 16. - [Commentator] Srna's cross, Mandzukic takes a spill, Perisic, Olic. (fans cheering) Ivica Olic, his first world cup goal for 12 years in the finals. This is Perisic here with a lovely burst, Perisic. (fans cheering) Such a strong run, such a fine finish, and that might just finish off Cameroon. Looking for more goals here. In by Pranjic, Mandzukic. (fans cheering) The goals just keep on coming for Croatia. Kovacic, pull back here now for Eduardo. Eduardo shots, Itandje saves, and it's happened, a gift, Mandzukic's second, Croatia's fourth. - [Announcer] That result meant Cameroon wouldn't progress, but Brazil and Mexico and Croatia all stood a chance of a place in the Round of 16. After a non-convincing match against the Mexicans, the Seleção needed to establish their state as true contenders and wasted no time against Cameroon. - [Commentator] Good work again from Luiz Gustavo, and Neymar. Brazil have the goal they so desired and the stadium erupts. (fans cheering) Still battling away. Oh my word, Joel Matip will put it in and silence the Estadio Nacional. Here's Neymar, little bit of a corridor in which to run and he doesn't miss often when given that kind of opportunity. (fans cheering) He might be carrying the expectations of his nation on his shoulders but he's showing no signs of buckling. (fans cheering) Neymar. That's a juggle by Fernandinho, David Luiz will play it back in and Fred heads it home. First goal of the tournament and finally a smile on his face. (fans cheering) Oscar lays it back, it's Oscar again and looks to play it in, it is another goal. Nerves settled by Fernandinho. (fans cheering) It's a goal that could secure top spot in the group for Brazil. - [Announcer] While Brazil fought Cameroon, the battle was on in Recife for the final spot in the last 16, as Croatia took on Mexico. - [Commentator] In by Herrera, Skipper scored. (fans cheering) Rafael Marquez, the grand old man of Mexican football. Peralta beyond Hernandez, that'll do it. Guardado wraps it up, Mexico are going through. Ain't no stopping them now. Mexico will go through second with seven points. Oh, knicked on cleverly at the near post and finished with certainty by Chicharito. (fans cheering) Croatia, I'm sure, would like to get on the coach soon, Perisic, get on the plane back to Zagreb. Rakitic, maybe one last flourish, Perisic scores. It is the first goal Mexico have conceded at these world cup finals. - [Announcer] That result saw Mexico join Brazil in the knockout phase at the expense of Croatia. Cameroon, meanwhile, would make the long journey home without a single point in Group A. - [Announcer] On to Group B where 2010's World Cup finalists featured. In addition to the Spanish and Dutch teams were Chile and Australia. The opening Group B game was a repeat of the final four years ago, but no one could've predicted the scoreline to follow as Spain played the Netherlands. - [Commentator] It's Diego Costa that tried to turn it in, was clipped as he did so. Well, was there much contact there? Xabi Alonso at his 6th major tournament, a cool head on a big occasion gives Spain the early lead. That's a good ball as well. Oh the header, oh my word, van Persie with an absolute stunner. (fans cheering) Robin van Persie in full flight. Guzman, Sneijder, Robben, looking to reach and does, his second touch puts it in range, his third finds the back of the net. (fans cheering) Just before the break and just after. (whistle ringing) Here's Wesley Sneijder with the cross, oh, he's bobbled it in, bobbled it in in the far post, nothing wrong with that. (fans cheering) Casillas has to hurry, dispossessed, van Persie, it's a fourth, unbelievable. My word, what a game, what a performance, and what a scoreline, and here comes Robben again, look at the pace here, Arjen Robben, controls, Robben, Robben, easy. (fans cheering) Casillas was left floundering, so to the Spanish defense. Spain humbled, hammered, humiliated by Holland. - [Announcer] After the shock scoreline at the Arena Fonte Nova, Chile did their best to follow that win as they faced an impressive Socceroo side. - [Commentator] Oh, lovely control, Aranguiz goes on, Aranguiz still here, Ryan comes to meet, ball clipped in, and here's Alexis Sanchez. (fans cheering) Didn't take long, did it? Here goes Alexis Sanchez, Alexis Sanchez, Valdivia. (fans cheering) The Chileans mean business big time in Brazil. Ivan Franjic, there's Tim Cahill. (fans cheering) Trademark leap. And now, Mauricio Pinilla. Ryan saves, Beausejour. (fans cheering) That's it. That's a lovely take, a great finish. - [Announcer] Australia were back in action in Porto Alegre for the next group match, facing elimination if they lost to an unsung Dutch side. - [Commentator] Robben, he's got away from Wilkinson, Arjen Robben has blend to his left, he might go all the way at this himself, and Arjen Robben scores. (fans cheering) It's his third goal of this world cup and he's now scored in seven of his last eight international appearances. The Netherlands in front, but Australia looking for a quick comeback and they've got it. Tim Cahill, astonishing. Wow. What a couple of minutes in Porto Alegre. It's almost as if Tim Cahill is saying to Arjen Robben, anything you can do, I can match it. They're too far away, Bozanic thought about a shot there. Will try again, appeals for handball, he's given it, the referee, it's handball. It's a penalty kick to Australia. The handball by Daryl Janmaat. Jedinak, the Australian captain, to put his country in front. (whistle ringing) 2-1 Australia. (fans cheering) van Persie, he's onside, 2-2. Now it's Dutch delirium in Porto Alegre. He's onside, played onside there by Jason Davidson, and he's not gonna miss from there. Depay, it's in. (fans cheering) Memphis Depay for Holland, and the Dutch lead by three goals to two in this incredible Group B game. - [Announcer] After the humiliation at the hands of the Dutch, Spain faced Chile next for a do or die match in front of a packed Maracana. - [Announcer] Sanchez, it's a lovely ball from Sanchez, and here's Vargas. (fans cheering) The irresistible Chileans have the lead and the champions are on the brink. (fans cheering) (whistle ringing) Alexis Sanchez. Beat it out as far as Aranguiz, who scores a second for Chile (fans cheering) and leaves Spain on the very edge. The Spanish crown has slipped, there will be new world champions in 2014. - [Announcer] The Netherlands and Chile both through to the last 16 after two games a piece, with Spain and Australia hoping to damage limitation in their remaining tie. With the champions dethroned, it was only pride at steak then for Spain's clash with Australia, another loss in that final match was unthinkable. - [Commentator] Juanfran, David Villa, oh, great finish. (fans cheering) A well-taken goal. Going home, yes, but they go home here with a goal which is a picture. (fans cheering) Iniesta, oh, great ball here, Fernando Torres, Torres in. (fans cheering) Another of their own goal, of the old school for Spain glimmers today flashes of the old Spanish star, of the old Spanish swagger. Iniesta, it's Cesc Fabregas, and here's Juan Mata. Mata. (fans cheering) And it doesn't matter in the world cup context but Spain here signing off with at least a display to give their fans some goals, some points, something to take home and cling on to. - [Announcer] The final group game saw Louis van Gaal's rampant Dutch team face Chile at the Arena de Sao Paulo with another fine display to follow. - [Commentator] Corner's been taken. It's in, what a fair impact from Leroy Fer. (fans cheering) The substitute who's been on a matter on moments and has put the Dutch in front. de Jong, Robben, Arjen Robben, Depay's made a run into the middle, Depay. That's it, victory for the Netherlands. (fans cheering) Three wins out of three in Group B. - [Announcer] It was maximum points for the Flying Dutchman in Group B, while Chile also looks impressive as they progress to the knockout stages. - [Announcer] Group C featured four teams never to have faced each other in the FIFA World Cup. The favorites, Colombia, along with Japan, Cote d'Ivoire, and Greece. Kicking off the group in Belo Horizonte were Colombia and Greece. Radamel Falcao was ruled out of the tournament by injury but the team made light to their star striker's absence. - [Commentator] No question if it's offside against Cuadrado, tries to take on the opponent, does so skillfully, the ball allowed to run through and it's sliced into the net. Colombia lead in the fifth minute. There may have been another touch after his but Jose Pekerman stands behind a jubilant pack of Colombians. Los Cafeteros lead. It slides through and in, Colombia got a second goal and it couldn't have been easier, it is prodded home by Gutierrez from a yard out. They've got their two goals and they're looking goal number three here now, with Cuadrado, and again, he's coming through here, three-nil Colombia. (fans cheering) Super moment for a super player, James Rodriguez, three-nil. - [Announcer] Cote d'Ivoire faced Asian champions Japan next in the heat of Recife, where the Samurai Blue took the early initiative. - [Commentator] Nagatomo, this is Honda. Oh yes. (fans cheering) Japan's star player has scored their opening goal at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Aurier, Gervinho ahead of him, Aurier's cross, that's it. (fans cheering) Bony has equalized, and the teams are leveled. Gervinho, Bony, Aurier, another great cross, it's in. (fans cheering) Two goals in the space of a couple of minutes have turned this football match on its head. Victory for the Cote d'Ivoire. - [Announcer] Those elephants were back in action for the next group game, but this time had the unenviable task of facing Colombia and the rampant James Rodriguez. - [Commentator] It's a great header. Colombia lead (fans cheering) and Brazilia erupts. (fans cheering) James Rodriguez has taken the acclaim again here. Oh, a moment to lose the ball there, so the end, this might well be it. Is this number two for Colombia? It surely is and they're surely on their way with a mix of the golden generation. Juan Quintero sends Colombia into ecstasy here in Brazilia. That's brilliant. Oh, it's a fantastic world cup goal. Gervinho. Well I was saying they needed something special, how special was that? - [Announcer] Having lost their opening matches, Japan versus Greece was a crunch game for both teams in Natal, with the threat of elimination looming. - [Commentator] Really big challenge there by Torosidis. Torosidis. Oh, that's a great save. (fans cheering) Easily Greece's best opportunity of the match. Karagounis, header by Gekas. Oh, that's big save by Kawashima. Endo. And it's better by Okubo. Nil-nil in Natal. - [Announcer] All still to play for in Group C after four games, with Colombia certain to advance, leaving Cote d'Ivoire, Japan, and Greece, all within a chance. Japan had the daunting prospect of playing the free scoring Colombians in Cuiaba in their last group game, with time ticking away in their FIFA World Cup campaign. - [Commentator] Well here's Ramos. Oh, and the referee's given a penalty. Challenge from Konno on Ramos. So Cuadrado against Kawashima. Scores. (fans cheering) And this world cup just gets better and better and better for Colombia. Honda, and the header, and a goal, Okazaki has injured Colombia pride here. The fullback Arias, sets up the chance here, it's Martinez. (fans cheering) And Colombia have the lead again. Oh, break's on now. James Rodriguez. Japan desperately trying to get bodies back in there, it's Jackson Martinez. Scores. (fans cheering) Colombia are going to confirm themselves as Group C winners and face Uruguay in the last 16. Ramos, here's Rodriguez, onto that left foot, oh yes. (fans cheering) Bow down at his feet, he's a genius. They vanquish Japan here, James Rodriguez sparkled. - [Announcer] Greece needed to cause an upset to rescue their chances of progressing in the tournament. Only a win would see them through as they play Cote d'Ivoire. Tiote, that's a bit short, Bamba couldn't get to it in time, and Greece with a great chance here, and Greece take the lead. Samaris, the sub, and it's Andreas Samaris who puts Greece in front. Kalou, trying to turn, and slips it through, and now Bony. There's the equalizer for Cote d'Ivoire. It's another substitute who scored with a beautifully fashioned equalizer. (fans cheering) That's a decent ball in, Samaris is brought down and the referee has pointed to the penalty spot. Well it looked to me as though Samaris clicked his own heel. Is Samaris? Yes it is. (fans cheering) Greece lead 2-1. Greece about to make history, Greece going through to the last 16 of the world cup finals. Los Cafeteros then topped Group C, but Greece's last gasp winner saw them through to the last 16 for the first time, sending Les Éléphants packing. - [Announcer] Group D hosted three previous world cup winners, with Italy, Uruguay, and England, while Costa Rica completed one of the toughest groups on paper. Reigning Copa America champions, Uruguay, played Costa Rica in the first Group D game, but they were missing striker Luis Suarez who was recovering from knee surgery. - [Commentator] Forlan's cross is a peach, or was that a Uruguayan hand in there? Oh no. It's a penalty to Uruguay. Diego Lugano is grabbed hold on there. Edison Cavani against Keylor Navas. Cavani scores and the pockets of blue around the stadium rejoice. Bolanos, can Gamboa keep it in? Yes he can, not a bad cross, either, Borges attacking it, it'll come out as far as Campbell, what a goal, Costa Rica. Joel Campbell, Uruguay sixes and sevens, and what an emphatic finish that is. Christian Bolanos to turn it in, and Duarte is there. 2-1 Costa Rica. What a story is unfolding here now. Campbell, surely the man of the match, looking for Urena, Urena. Oh, I don't believe this, I don't believe this. Marcos Urena to surely wrap up this game and give all the points to Costa Rica. (fans cheering) - [Announcer] Cesare Prandelli's Italy needed to avoid a repeat of their disastrous 2010 world cup as they played a youthful England squad in the heat of Manaus. - [Commentator] Pirlo, lovely dummy, oh, is that the shot for Marchisio? Italy in front. (fans cheering) Claudio Marchisio. Sterling, that's a lovely pass to Rooney. Only Sturridge in the middle, there he is, goal. England on terms. Daniel Sturridge on the end of a quite delicious cross from Wayne Rooney. Candreva, space for the cross, and there's Balotelli. (fans cheering) It's Super Mario for the Azzurri. - [Announcer] After their opening defeat to Costa Rica, Uruguay's star striker Luis Suarez returned to the team and immediately terrorized the Three Lions. It's Edison Cavani for Uruguay, looking for Suarez. Suarez scores. (fans cheering) Written in the stars. (fans cheering) Knee operation or not, Luis Suarez has goals as his middle name. Excellent close control, needs to release it, has found Glen Johnson, Glen Johnson gets it across, should be a goal, it is. At long last, Wayne Rooney has a world cup finals goal. And Suarez is in behind England, Suarez to win it, Suarez wins it, surely. More calamitous defending by England, and yet again, Suarez on hand to punish them. (fans cheering) - [Announcer] Costa Rica were hoping to stun the Italian team as they had the Uruguayans in their opening match. This fixture unfolded in front of 44,000 fans in Recife. - [Commentator] Diaz. Ruiz. (fans cheering) Goal given, Costa Rica have their lead. Buffon clutched at nothing and it bounced from Costa Rica's point of view, clearly the right side of the line. - [Announcer] Heading into their last group games, Costa Rica had assured their place in the knockout phase. With England eliminated, Italy and Uruguay would fight it out to qualify. With Costa Rica through and England out, this match was always destined to be a tame affair with both teams giving a run-out to second choice squads. - [Commentator] 22 and a half minutes played, exactly halfway through the half. Brilliant save from Foster as well. And Sturridge, Sturridge, carries on, here's Sturridge. An inch away from glory. - [Announcer] Crunch time in Natal as Italy looked to avoid a second successive exit at the world cup group stage, but they faced a Uruguay team themselves fighting for survival. - [Commentator] Corner kick to Uruguay, last 10 minutes. They need a goal, and they've got one. (fans cheering) It's the captain Godin who heads Uruguay towards the last 16. Pandemonium in Natal. Arrivederci, Azzurri. Uruguay are through, Italy are out. (fans cheering) - [Announcer] Costa Rica and Uruguay then were the latest Latin American teams to book their place in the next round, while heavyweights, Italy and England, made the long journey home. - [Announcer] Group E featured European neighbors Switzerland and France, along with Ecuador who'd earned the final South American automatic spot in Honduras. It was the Swiss who kicked off the action against the Ecuadorians, Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's Swan Song after announcing he'd retire at the end of the tournament. - [Commentator] Lichtsteiner, battling away, and has given away the free kick as well. So Ayovi looking to curl one in with the left foot, down and in, and Ecuador, in the shape of Enner Valencia, have the opening goal. So Ricardo Rodriguez is the man to take this corner here for Switzerland. Oh, and it's in. (fans cheering) My word, what a thunderous header, and what about that for an impact from the substitute's bench. He'll tell you it was planned all along. Rodriguez, Mehmedi wants it, Rodriguez, oh and they've got a winner. With less than 30 seconds to play, Haris Seferovic, Seferovic wins it for the Swiss. - [Announcer] France had only just scraped through qualifying and were without injured star Franck Ribery. First up for them, Honduras in Porto Alegre. Appeals for a penalty and it's been given. And the referee quick to point to the spot. Benzema there, to put France in front. Benzema makes it 1-nil to France. In towards Benzema. Oh, it didn't cross the line, has it? Yes. Benzema with the shot across goal, it hits the post, Goal-Line Technology says goal. Here's Benzema. France's third goal and it surely means all three points to France as well. (fans cheering) No way that Valladares was gonna get too near it. Three goals and three points for France. - [Announcer] After that convincing win, Le Bleu were back in action, playing their second group match in Salvador, against the promising Switzerland side. - [Commentator] They have dominated possession, can they turn it into something a little better here? Mathieu Valbuena to take this corner kick, the header, oh, it's in. (fans cheering) The goalkeeper reached at it but Olivier Giroud has just managed to squeeze it past and France have the early goal. Matuidi with a second, in the blink of an eye, France have a 2-nil lead. Oh, look at the space they got here now, Olivier Giroud with pace and time and rolls it in for a third goal. France have three. Oh, it's an opportunity for Benzema who will not miss from there. His third world cup goal. Well they've got the numbers again here. Benzema will try to cue it up with the right foot and then place it up for Sissoko. It is five goals for the French. (fans cheering) This really has been an extraordinary show by the French. Admir through the wall, and Loris is beaten. Switzerland do have a goal back, too little too late to rescue their pride today. Ball in, oh, and another classic finish, absolutely raining goals here now. Xhaka with another goal back for Switzerland. But five goals to two is quite a scoreline. - [Announcer] A must win match next between Honduras and Ecuador, both knowing a second defeat would leave the losers in real danger. - [Commentator] There's that familiar ball forward and it's Carlo Costly, sight of goal. (fans cheering) Honduras in front on the left foot of Carlo Costly. (fans cheering) Paredes. Deflection's awkward, and it's in. Enner Valencia now has scored in each of his last six international appearances. It's a free kick here now in a great position for Ecuador. It's Walter Ayovi. The header's in. Enner Valencia delivers Ecuador firmly into this world cup in Group E. So after two games each, France had all but secured their place in the last 16, one of Ecuador and Switzerland the likeliest to join them. South Americans Ecuador had the tough test of a match against top of the table, France, knowing they had to better Switzerland's performance. - [Commentator] Bacary Sagna, delicious ball in, Dominguez somehow kept it out, as Griezmann attacked it at the near post. (fans cheering) Valencia, Noboa, golden chance. Well they won't get many and they must optimize the ones that come. Sagna, Benzema, Remy, Loic Remy. Dominguez equal to it. - [Announcer] The early defeat to France had left Switzerland shell-shocked, and having lost defender Steve von Bergen to injury, they needed a win over Honduras. - [Commentator] Shaqiri, oh, he scored a wonderful goal, stellar flying start, a goal of magic, a goal of wonder, and the Swiss in front by one goal to nil. Oh, Bernardez has missed the ball here, it's come to Drmic, Shaqiri is with him. Here is Xherdan Shaqiri again. It's his day, it's Switzerland's day, two-nil both to Shaqiri. Has got the pace to get in behind him, he has some support in the middle only really for Shaqiri. Josip Drmic, and here is Shaqiri. The world cup's 50th hat trick. Qualification now all but guaranteed for the Swiss. - [Announcer] So Switzerland joined France in the knockout stage, Ecuador finishing on four points, with Honduras yet to win a match at a FIFA World Cup. - [Announcer] And so on to Group F where one of the tournament favorites, Argentina, were the headline act along with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria. And what a tough start for the FIFA World Cup debutant, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as they took on Argentina under the gaze of 77,000 fans at the Maracana. (fans cheering and clapping) - [Commentator] Aguero in there, likewise Campagnaro. It's a devilish delivery, it's in. The Argentines have broken through. Messi. Higuain, Messi kept going, it's Lionel Messi, he scored. (fans cheering) The goal the world wanted, at last an explosion of the exceptional, iconic goal for Lionel Messi. Oh that's a beautifully weighted ball, Ibisevic has rolled it through the goalkeeper and in. Bosnia Herzegovina's first ever world cup finals goal. - [Announcer] Next up, Iran, under experienced coach, Carlos Queiroz, faced Nigeria, the reigning Africa Cup of Nations Champions in Curitiba. - [Commentator] Masoud saw the near post gap. Oh, good save. Haghighi across in the nick of time for Iran. Dejagah takes, oh, great header, great save. Enyeama's reactions were razor sharp. Full time score in Curitiba, Iran, nil, Nigeria, nil. - [Announcer] In Bello Horizonte for their second group match, Argentina were up against Iran, a tournament favorite against one of the competition's lowest ranked sides. - [Commentator] Argentina come again. With Messi, he'll go for goal here, oh my goodness gracious, me. If one man could win a football match, it would be Lionel Messi. Iran hearts have broken and Lionel Messi surely just sent Argentina through to the Round of 16. - [Announcer] Having lost their opening match, Bosnia and Herzegovina were rock bottom of Group F when they kicked off against Nigeria. - [Commentator] Emenike tries to light the fire, as he has done, too, Emenike, Odemwingie. (fans cheering) Nigeria's world cup account open, Odemwingie, after a year away from the national team, has got the go-ahead goal. - [Announcer] So Argentina's progress already assured thanks to the excellent Messi, with Nigeria and Iran both in with a chance of joining them. Iran went into their match against Bosnia and Herzegovina able to reach the knockout phase if they won, but they'd also need Nigeria to lose against Argentina. Dzeko, on that left foot, Edin Dzeko. Wonderful strike, right at the hearts of Iranian hopes. Hosseini has given it away in a dangerous position, Dzeko immediately prods it forward, and here they come, and there they go with Pjanic. Miralem Pjanic. The Iranians, the architects of their own downfall there. Punari will try and put it back in there. Heydari lifts it forward, Nekounam, there's no flag here, there's a goal for Iran. Ghoochannejhad, their first of the tournament. It is only a glimmer of a hope, but it's a glimmer more than we expected. Salihovic lays it forward, though, Vrsajevic, Vrsajevic, breaking Iranian hearts just when they'd started to beat again. His first goal in international football. - [Announcer] As if you needed any more convincing about the form of Lionel Messi, you only had to watch Argentina's final group game against Nigeria in Porto Alegre. - [Commentator] Di Maria, off the post, off the goalkeeper and away to safety but knocked in in the rebound, who else? Lionel Messi. What a start. Argentina's talisman has hit three goals in as many matches. Played out wide by Babatunde, two in the middle, oh, they've got an equalizer. Musa, Ahmed Musa strikes back almost immediately for Nigeria. And Argentina fans hoping that their hero can do what he does best. Messi strikes, oh, extraordinary. Four goals in this world cup now for Lionel Messi. Musa, Emenike, Musa, he might be away here, Musa, 2-2. Musa was through, the only question was, could he finish? The answer, emphatically, yes. Scenes of jubilation. Lavezzi will take this corner. Towards Garay, 3-2. Rojo with the final touch. Argentina are going to move into the knockout stages with three wins out of three. - [Announcer] Argentina with a perfect score in Group F, Nigeria following them through to the last 16 as Iran missed out on the next phase. - [Announcer] Group G followed with three time winners, Germany, Euro 2012 semifinalist, Portugal, Ghana, and a strong-looking USA. The opener pitted the highly regarded Germans against Portugal, a side hauled through qualifying by the form of Cristiano Ronaldo. - [Commentator] The ricochet favors the Germans, a clever little back heel, lovely play into the area, chance here for Gotze, down he goes, the referee will award the penalty kick. Much to Portuguese disgust. Big, big moment in the game. Joao Pereira, there he is, he's all over Gotze, dragged him back. Thomas Muller is the man in charge with the responsibility. Germany lead. (fans cheering) Corner kick, only Germany's second of the match, Portugal haven't gotten one yet. The height of Hummels, the goal of Hummels. (fans cheering) Climbing above anybody in the red of Portugal, Germany may already be on their way to the three points. Four Germans across the center here, the header down from Howedes. Crucial moment of the game, you feel this. Germany get another one, and they do, terrible, terrible defending, and Thomas Muller has his second of this world cup. They'll come again with Schurrle. The goalkeeper saves it, initially, but Germany have got four. And Thomas Muller has the first hat trick of his international career. They've won by four goals to nil, it's all over. - [Announcer] In Natal, Ghana who equaled Africa's best ever performance by reaching the quarters in 2010, open their campaign against the USA. - [Commentator] Ghana, who reached the Round of 16 in 2006, quarterfinal this last time out, on the back foot here, Dempsey, an early goal. One of the earliest goals in world cup final history. Clint Dempsey, the USA have takeoff. And here's Andre Ayew. (fans cheering) That's the equalizer. All Ghana's pressure eventually pays off. (fans cheering) Zusi now. Can the USA find another goal with less than five minutes to go? Yes they can. It's the substitute John Brooks. (fans cheering) He can hardly believe what has just happened to him. Ghana have had a point snatched out of their palm here. - [Announcer] The Black Stars had the unenviable task of facing Germany in Fortaleza next, but showed resilience against Joachim Low's men. - [Commentator] Muller, in towards Gotze. (fans cheering) Mario Gotze scores early in the second half and Germany are in front in Fortaleza. Aphil, three in the middle to aim for, and Neuer is beaten, Ghana with the equalizer. (fans cheering) Andre Ayew. (fans cheering) What a response from Ghana. And Hummels will stretch to reach that. Sulley Muntari, through to Gyan, who's onside, it's Asamoah Gyan, it's 2-1 Ghana. (fans cheering) They'll be dancing on the streets in Ghana with that second goal, and what a turnaround in this fixture. Extraordinary. German corner. And in, it's 2-2. Miroslav Klose. And that is a moment of history, his 15th goal at a world cup finals. And Germany are right back in it. - [Announcer] After that four goal thriller, bottom of the table Portugal were fighting to stay in the tournament as they took on Jurgen Klinsmann's Stars and Stripes in Manaus. - [Commentator] This is Almeida. Thread in by Veloso, it's a mistake, chance for Nani. Portugal lead. Here is Jermaine Jones. Struck it well, oh, magnificent goal. (fans cheering) Just open up that top drawer and file that one right in there. (fans cheering) Yedlin with a ball in, Bradley, chance for USA, and it's a goal, it stands and it's the captain, Clint Dempsey. Look at these scenes. Bradley, this would be a third successive USA win over Portugal, unless we have a most dramatic twist in the final seconds now. Into the last 30, oh, and we have. Unbelievable goal. There was 30 seconds left and it's a dream of a cross from Ronaldo, and Varela buries it. (fans cheering) - [Announcer] After all that, Germany sat top of Group G with four points, but it was all to play for with both Ghana and Portugal also still able to qualify. Those two faced each other in their final group match, each needing a large margin of victory and a heavy defeat for the USA in the other game. - [Commentator] Broke handler there for Moutinho, who juggles, who kicks his way through, delivers the ball, Veloso's cross in, sliced into his own goal, it's an own goal by the Ghanaian defender, John Boye. Might get to that equalizer here and they have, and inevitably, it's that man, Asamoah Gyan who scores for Ghana and keeps their dream alive. Nani just about keeps this one in and he'll lay in a cross there. Almost some confusion between goalkeeper and defenders, maybe now Ronaldo, yes. He has goal number 50 of his international career. Total confusion in the Ghanaian defense and that surely is the end of Ghana's ambitions now. A rainy Recife was the setting for Jurgen Klinsmann to battle his friend and countryman Joachim Low, where a draw would be enough to see both the USA and Germany through. - [Commentator] Corner to Germany, which they take short. Ozil, great save by Howard again. Not this time, Germany at the front. (fans cheering) What accuracy there by Muller, through the eye of a needle. One goal settled it, USA and Germany will bless the latter stages of this competition with their presence. - [Announcer] So the two German coaches led their sides into the knockout stage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while to their shock, Portugal made an early exit. - [Announcer] Group H matched the heavily tipped Belgians with Algeria, the only Arab nation represented, Russia, and Korea Republic. The first test for Belgium's golden generation in Belo Horizonte was an Algeria side who hadn't scored a FIFA World Cup goal in 28 years. - [Commentator] Progress down that left-hand side, De Bruyne is across to try and close him down, the cross, the pull, the penalty's gonna be given. (fans cheering) Sofiane Feghouli, from the penalty spot, scores Algeria's first goal of the world cup in 2014. Their first world cup goal in 28 years. Fellaini, oh, he's got it. Off of the bench and scores the goal, Marouane Fellaini, just what they wanted. Subtly Hazard looking to turn it right, this could win it, Mertens, 2-1 for Belgium. (fans cheering) And it's two of the substitutes that have turned this game around. (fans cheering) - [Announcer] Cuiaba hosted Russia's opening fixture. Fabio Capello's men up against Korea Republic, appearing at their eight successive FIFA World Cup. - [Commentator] Options left and right here. Oh, and Akinfeev has spilled it in. It's a goal for Korea (fans cheering) and it's the substitute. Nice ball into the path here of Dzagoev, Samedov looking for Yeshchenko. Referee playing an advantage here, Dzagoev. Good stuff from the goalkeeper, it's turned in, Russia are on terms. Aleksandr Kerzhakov. And so it is a point a piece in Group H. - [Announcer] The famous Maracana in Rio de Janeiro is the setting for Belgium's second Group H match, with Russia hoping to cause an upset. - [Commentator] Here come Belgium on the counterattack. Mirallas calling for the ball down the middle. Hazard, pulled back here, one-nil to Belgium. They have scored the winning goal. Divock Origi with a goal two and a half minutes of the end of the game, probably seals qualification. (fans cheering) - [Announcer] In Porto Alegre, Korea Republic played Algeria, the only side without a point after the first round of group matches. - [Commentator] Medjani, getting it back from Feghouli, looking to release Slimani, who is quick, and he's between the two defenders here, Slimani. Goal, Algeria. (fans cheering) Third corner for Algeria. Keeper's missed it, it's two-nil. Halliche. Algeria in dreamland, two goals in two minutes. It's gonna come down here for Slimani, Slimani shoots for three, and it is, three-nil, Algeria. Djabou. Ki Sung-yueng, egregious mistake. Son, goal. (fans cheering) Son Heung-min with it. And Korea Republic see perhaps a glimmer of an opportunity here to get back into this one. Feghouli. Now Brahimi, to his left, Djabou. Brahimi instead for Feghouli, but in for fall, oh, what a fabulous goal. Yacine Brahimi. (fans cheering) Followed by Kim Young-gwon, attacking it was Kim Shin-wook, a real challenge for Son, and it's another one back. Koo Ja-Cheol with a final touch. The goals keep on coming. (fans cheering) - [Announcer] After two games, Belgium were through to the last 16. Algeria, best place to join them, but the others still in with a shot. Algeria then in with a chance of reaching the knockout stage for the first time in their footballing history as they faced Russia in Curitiba. - [Commentator] Excellent early cross, oh, it's magnificent from Kokorin. (fans cheering) And Russia off to a flying start. (fans cheering) (fans chanting) Right in front of the bulk of the Algerian crowd inside the Arena da Baixada. It's Brahimi who's gonna take the free kick. There's a laser, just a beam towards Akinfeev, he can't get there. (fans cheering) And history for Algeria, Halilhodzic the hero, Fabio Capello exits the world cup at the group stage for the second time in a row. - [Announcer] In Sao Paulo, it was Belgium against Korea Republic. Marc Wilmots' men yet to really turn on the style in Brazil. - [Commentator] Given away cheaply that time, Belgium are to come again, Origi sees the opportunity, blocked, Vertonghen, goal. (fans cheering) Jan Vertonghen captaining Belgium for the day, might well have just preserved their 100% record at these world cup finals. - [Announcer] So a first for Algeria, through to the last 16 along with one of the youngest teams in the tournament, Belgium. - [Announcer] The group stage produced almost as many goals as the entire 2010 FIFA World Cup. No fewer than 136 were scored across the eight groups, with Group B boasting the highest return. (fans cheering) (dramatic instrumental music) But it wasn't a tournament of celebration for everyone. Defending champion Spain were dethroned and left deflated as they crashed out after defeats in their opening two matches. And two further giants fell. First England, and then Italy booked an early flight home. Two former world cup winners not to make the knockout stage at the hands of Uruguay and Costa Rica. As the Europeans were conquered, Latin America reigned. (dramatic instrumental music) Lionel Messi announced his intent in the world cup finals, firing Argentina through. And another number 10, James Rodriguez, scored three for Colombia, a new star in the making. Unfancied Algeria were the history-makers, reaching the last 16 for the first time, alongside Belgium. Germany continued chasing their fourth semifinal in a row. While another German, Jurgen Klinsmann, steered the USA through at the expense of Portugal. The Netherlands showed the speed and guile needed in Brazil, joined in the next round by an impressive Chile. Brazil rode a tidal wave of national pride, edging out Mexico, with their star man Neymar scoring four goals. - [Announcer] This is how the last 16 looked with Greece and Nigeria also making the cut, set to face Costa Rica and France, while Switzerland also made it through from Group E. But first in the knockout phase, the host Brazil were in action again. Inspired by Neymar in the group stage, the Brazilians hoped he would shine once more against dangerous South American rivals, Chile. Jorge Sampaoli's side had impressed with wins over Spain and Australia. - [Commentator] This time it's Neymar on the right foots, little flick to David Luiz will turn it in. (fans cheering) His first goal for Brazil. (fans cheering) Oh, he's left it short, and here now is Sanchez, who gets the equalizer, and for the most part, this stadium is silenced. Second goal of the tournament for Alexis Sanchez. Brazil one, Chile one, with penalties to come. It's a long run up for David Luiz, up he steps, and sends the goalkeeper the wrong way. (fans cheering) Alexis Sanchez, here he comes, shuts out the noise, Julio Cesar, (fans cheering) two penalties faced, two penalties saved. Gonzalo Jara to keep Chile in the world cup, if he misses, Brazil are through. Jara, oh, he's hit the post, and he has missed (fans cheering) and Brazil have squeaked into the quarterfinals. - [Announcer] To the Maracana next, and Colombia, who won new fans for their flowing football and talismanic number 10, James Rodriguez, played a Uruguay side fresh from victories over England and Italy. - [Commentator] Out by Alvaro Pereira, hit by James. Oh, what a goal. (fans cheering) One of the greats. (fans cheering) My word, this boy's a star. Four games, four goals in World Cup 2014. (fans cheering) Winded for Jackson Martinez. Now Pablo Armero. It's a delicious cross, Cuadrado, it's in. Guess who? Guess who? (fans cheering) It's him again. Just can't help himself. - [Announcer] In Fortaleza, the Netherlands, with 10 goals so far, were up against Mexico, whose keeper, Guillermo Ochoa, only conceded once in the group stage. Would the attack falter or the defense crumble? - [Commentator] Flicked away by Vlaar, only as far as dos Santos, Blind after him, dos Santos with a shot, dos Santos with a goal. Mexico take the lead. Three minutes into the second half, Giovani dos Santos. In comes the latest corner, Ochoa got it wrong, but might get away with it, Sneijder, 1-1. (fans cheering) Robben, oh, he's away here, Robben. O, he's done brilliantly, goes down, penalty. The Netherlands have a penalty in injury time. Huntelaar against Ochoa for a place in the quarterfinals of the world cup. Huntelaar scores. (fans cheering) Next stage, here we come. - [Announcer] Costa Rica, who qualified from Group D, ahead of England and Italy, face Greece in the last 16. The Europeans hard fought win over Cote d'Ivoire had earned them an unexpected place in the knockout phase. Bolanos, Ruiz, (fans cheering) that's it, breakthrough time in Recife. (fans cheering) Mitroglou, Papastathopoulus lets it run, great save, there's the equalizer, there is the equalizer, Greece have done it again. It's gonna be penalties to decide whether Costa Rica or Greece march into the last eight of the competition. Ruiz. (fans cheering) They're all belters so far. Pressure, all pressure, we shall see. Brilliant save. (fans cheering) The most important kick, arguably, in Costa Rican football history is about to unfold. Unchartered waters for Costa Rica. They enter the last eight. Greece are eliminated. - [Announcer] So Costa Rica took their place in the final eight, but like the host Brazil, they'd done it the hard way. Inspired substitutions helped the Netherlands progress, only Colombia's victory was comfortable. In Brasilia, France took on Nigeria, the pace in power with the African's attack that cost Argentina problems in the group stage and would be the toughest test so far for Didier Deschamps' side. - [Commentator] France are storming in looking for the winning goal maybe at this moment. Well, it's there now, it's into the net. Paul Pogba, foiled by Enyeama in the first half, is not to be denied today. Valbuena to Benzema, to Valbuena, it's almost at standing space in the moment and Griezmann has got the second. That's France through to the last 16, that's Nigeria on the plane home. The Nigerian defense was statuesque. - [Announcer] As Germany faced Algeria, making their first foray into the knockout stage, the Arab nation provided a stern challenge, and 90 minutes wasn't enough to separate the sides. In Porto Alegre, the game continued into extra time. - [Commentator] Schurrle, Andre Schurrle. (fans cheering) Germany make the breakthrough, 90 seconds into extra time. Andre Schurrle with the goal that breaks the deadlock here in Porto Alegre. Oh, they might be through here, Andre Schurrle, Schurrle lays it wide, Mesut Ozil, Andre Schurrle, cleared away off the line, Ozil, two-nil, Germany. Brahimi. Feghouli, decent ball across the back and Algeria have a goal, but it is surely too late. Djabou's late, late effort, not enough. Germany progress through to the quarterfinals. - [Announcer] 40,000 Argentina fans packed the stands in Sao Paulo to watch their team play Switzerland, aside with real title ambitions, up against Ottmar Hitzfeld's organized Swiss, who managed to keep Messi and Co. at bay until extra time. - [Commentator] Messi's away, Lionel Messi for Argentina, real chance and it's a goal. Angel Di Maria for Argentina. It's heartbreak for the Swiss and Argentina now, surely, are safely through to the quarterfinals. Messi was after this moment, he picked the time to release the pass, and Di Maria does the rest. - [Announcer] Next up for Belgium, what looks set to be an exhilarating last 16 clash with the USA, who'd given Germany a run for their money last time out. - Yay, USA. - [Commentator] Here's Lukaku, shaken off the defender, De Bruyne at the other edge of the penalty area, Lukaku with his first touch, oh, he tried to get it in for Bruyne, De Bruyne might still get in here, and does. And finally, Belgium have the goal. Kevin De Bruyne with the breakthrough. Two minutes into extra time. And the Belgians looking dangerous again here, as De Bruyne carries it with real threat, Lukaku is in the middle, there are four defenders back here, it's towards Lukaku, who wins it beyond doubt now here surely for Belgium. He has come on from the bench and made such a difference. Bradley again, looking for the little flick there. Oh, what a finish. Julian Green has only been on the field a matter of moments. But Belgium hang on and have beaten the United States. - [Announcer] That meant that Belgium were through to face Argentina in the last eight, while France versus Germany promised to be a classic European clash, as we head into the quarterfinals. - [Announcer] Sickness was announced in the German camp before their quarterfinal with France, but thankfully, all recovered for what has become a classic clash of nations. - [Commentator] Now France and Germany, shoulder to shoulder, toe to toe again, in a real resumption of one of the world cup's classic clashes. (fans cheering) Kroos to take. Inviting ball in, opening goal, Germany. Mats Hummels, off his sickbed and into the headlines. Kroos with a delicious ball in and Hummels with the smartest little deflection. Germany prevail again into the world cup's last four for a record 13th time, and amazingly, semifinalists for the fourth time in a row. - [Announcer] The last game in Fortaleza saw Brazil play Colombia. Luiz Felipe Scolari's side taking full advantage of the home support, 65,000 screaming fans. - [Commentator] Thiago Silva comes forward, David Luiz comes forward. Paulinho is renowned base aerial prowess. Going towards Luiz and it's bundled in. Thiago Silva, the captain for Brazil. (fans cheering) Perfect start for Brazil. It is David Luiz. Oh, extraordinary goal. (fans cheering) Look at the movement on it as the ball just swerves in the air, away from Ospina, and the goalkeeper's valiant dive is all in vain. Rodriguez, Rodriguez again, flag stays down this time, is that a penalty as Julio Cesar comes out? And it is. And Colombia have a lifeline. It's 2-1. James Rodriguez with his sixth goal of this world cup. Brazil are through to the semifinals of their own world cup. - [Announcer] Worryingly for the Seleção, their star man, Neymar, was stretched off to hospital during the game after taking a knee in the back, with news following that he'd take no further part in the tournament. But no such worries for Argentina for their quarterfinal against Belgium's golden generation in Brasilia. The pressure was definitely on the South Americans in this fixture and they took only eight minutes to get off the mark. - [Commentator] Messi has done a full 180 degree turn there before finding Di Maria, is into the area to Higuain. Goal, Argentina score in the eighth minute of the game and it is Gonzalo Higuain with his first world cup goal of 2014. He didn't have a second in which to take aim, but he was deadly accurate when he did. Stylish finish from the Argentine number nine. The Italian referee is frustrating Sabella, he wants to hear a whistle, he hears it now, Argentina are through. (fans cheering) Belgium fought valiantly but never really looked like foiling Argentina. - [Announcer] As the Netherlands faced Costa Rica in Salvador, it was a tooth and nail battle with defensive heroics that saved Costa Rica from succumbing to the mighty Dutch in normal time. - [Commentator] It's Blind to play it in, oh, rolling across the face of goal, up off the crossbar, still they go, and de Vrij eventually will put it into the side netting. They have survived two heart-stopping scares at the end of the game. - [Announcer] With the game approaching a penalty shootout, more heroics followed, but this time in the shape of an all or nothing substitution. - [Commentator] Tim Krul of Newcastle United is coming on here and it's Jasper Cillissen who is going off. Well, what a change. And here comes Ruiz and Krul gets down to save it this time. Bryan Ruiz is denied. It's been a long time between droughts for international goals for Dirk Kuyt, October 2011 the last time he found the back of the net. Oh, and he does it superbly well. Michael Umana puts this wide or has it saved, Costa Rica go out, the Dutch go through. Here's the moment. It's Umana who steps up, oh, and Krul has saved it. It's Krul for the Dutch, it's crueler for Costa Rica. The goalkeeping hero who came on from the bench, in the very last second, has become a world cup hero. - [Announcer] And so the semifinals were set for a clash of the continents, South America and Europe colliding. Brazil would face Germany first in Belo Horizonte, while 2010 finalists, the Netherlands, would play two times tournament champions, Argentina, in Sao Paulo. Coming up in Goals from the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the dramatic semifinals, but first, 10 of the very best goals from the tournament so far. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] Dempsey, an early goal. (fans cheering) One of the earliest goals in world cup final history. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] Shaqiri, makes the space, oh, he scored a wonderful goal. Marvelous. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] Here's Rodriguez, onto that left foot, oh yes. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] It's Lionel Messi, he scored. The goal the world wanted. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] Here is Jermaine Jones, struck it well, oh, magnificent goal. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] With Messi, you go for goal here, oh, my goodness gracious me. If one man could win a football match, it would be Lionel Messi. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] Oh the header, oh my word. Van Persie with an absolute stunner. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] It is David Luiz, oh, extraordinary goal. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] But Australia looking for a quick comeback and they've got it, Tim Cahill, astonishing. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] Out by Alvaro Pereira, hit by James, oh, what a goal. One of the greats. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Heading into the semifinals of the FIFA World Cup, Brazil faced Germany in Belo Horizonte, with a nation of 200 million backing the home side, while Sao Paulo would host the Netherlands and Argentina. No Neymar through injury or suspended captain Thiago Silva for Brazil, but no one goes missing during their heartfelt national anthem, a war cry for Luiz Felipe Scolari's men. Brazil hadn't lost a competitive match on home soil for almost 40 years where their opponents, Germany, were in the semifinals for a record of four successive tournaments. - [Commentator] Germany's first corner. Plenty of height on air, it's gone through, Germany score. Kroos with the delivery, Muller with the sidestep and he now matches his tally of five goals in South Africa four years ago. Oh, and a mistake in defense here could let Kroos in, a chance of a second for Germany, Brazil in real trouble, they're in dire trouble now, we have a world cup record, supplied by Miroslav Klose. He's now one better than the great Ronaldo in all-time scoring chance with his 16th world cup finals goal. And Germany looking good for the final on Sunday, they might get another one here. It's three-nil, it's a run for the Germans, the game may be won and lost inside 25 minutes thanks to the left foot of Toni Kroos. Oh, it might get worse. This is for four, this is quite astonishing, it's all over now, it really is all over for Brazil. And they're here again, there's three forward, Khedira, Ozil, they're cueing up, they're all gonna score at this rate. Brazil totally all at sea, Ozil is, like, who wants it next? Who wants to score a goal? Lahm, wide is Khedira, back into Lahm, square, six-nil it is. And I think some Brazilians will be leaving Estadio Mineirao now. Oh what a night they're gonna have, but they might have number seven now. They have got seven, it's hammered in, an absolute terrific strike for Schurrle, who has his second in a matter of minutes. Now Oscar, maybe he can chip the keeper, maybe he can force one in, Oscar, he's got a goal. It's Brazil one, Germany seven and I've never seen a goal less celebrated in my life. Scant consolation on a most extraordinary semifinal. - [Announcer] In Sao Paulo, another big push was needed from the Netherlands as they faced Argentina who'd never lost a FIFA World Cup Semifinal. But with not even extra time enough to decide the tie, penalties followed. After beating Costa Rica on spot kicks, could the Dutch do it again? - [Commentator] For the first time in 16 years, a place in the world cup final will be decided from the penalty spot. Vlaar for the Netherlands. Saved by Romero. (fans cheering) This is when keepers come alive. The man for all moments, for many on planet football, the number one, the man. Messi, for sure. (fans cheering) So deft, so certain. Wesley Sneijder, oh, what a save, what a save. (fans cheering) And Argentina are nearly there. And so, Maxi Rodriguez. It's in, (fans cheering) and Argentina are real bound. The South American world cup has a South American finalist after all. - [Announcer] And so from 32 teams to two, as finalists Germany and Argentina set the stage for a showdown in Rio in the final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but first, the third place playoff. After heartbreak in Belo Horizonte, a crestfallen Seleção played their final game against the Netherlands in Brasilia to decide third place in Brazil. A chance to salvage some pride against the side eliminated by Argentina. - [Commentator] Van Persie to Robben, Arjen Robben into the Brazilian penalty area and that might just be a spot kick, it certainly is. So van Persie against Julio Cesar. One-nil Netherlands. This is dangerous again, the Brazilians are stretched, if the cross is good here, it might be a second for them. Oh, that's an awful clearance, two-nil. The Brazilians are punished for some horrible defending again. Robben, Janmaat, oh, it might be here for three, it is, and that just about rounds off the world cup finals, and the nation's sorrow is complete. - [Announcer] The Maracana was the fitting venue for the biggest game in the football calendar. Three times winners, Germany, who dispatched so ruthlessly with host Brazil, faced two times champions Argentina in the final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. - [Commentator] Oh, that's a terrible back header, into the palms of Higuain who should've opened the scoring in the world cup final. Kroos with the take, against the post. For the third time in a row, the world cup final heads into extra time. In there for Gotze. (fans cheering) Mario Gotze for Germany. What a fabulous touch and take from Mario Gotze. Taken with touch, with finesse, and stayed beyond Romero, and the first European world champions in South America just might be Germany today. Germany are the champions of the world. They need do no more, this is it, there is no higher to climb. - [Announcer] And so a record-shattering and heartbreaking tournament came to an end, with the new FIFA world cup champions crowned. 64 games passed in the blink of an eye. With every yard run, every sinew stretched, in pursuit of glory. (dramatic music) (funky upbeat music)
