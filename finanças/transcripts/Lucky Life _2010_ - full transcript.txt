Lucky life isn't one long string of horrors. And there are moments of peace and pleasure as I lie in between the blows. I can't believe they lost the photos. It was so rude of them. Maybe it's better. This way it won't affect how you remember. Did you pray this morning? Yes. What did you pray for? I can't tell you. It won't come true. That's not how it works. Did you pray for me? -Yes. What did you pray? I can't tell you. Yes, you can. Why are your feet always so cold? My lizard, my lively writher, may your limbs never wither. Know who wrote that? No. I was dreaming about Jason last night. About when we first went down to the beach house. I can see us talking to each other, but I can't remember any of the words we talked about. You mean in the dream, or in reality? Both. Oh. I really think this thing with Jason is affecting you. Mm-hmm. You're peeling. Let me put some lotion on your face. I'll get the, um -- It's sunny for a while. And there's only a very few showers on the last day. Great. How long does it take us to get there? 10 hours if I drive. But if Alex drives, then 8. I don't want to drive. What did you say? I don't want to drive. Do you want me to pack your sleeping pills? No. -Are you sure? -Yeah. -What you thinking about? -It's a long trip. Is it okay to wish that we're the only two people going down? Jason wants to see you. He wants to see you, too. We should call Alex and tell him not to come pick us up. Are you joking? I'm gonna get dressed. -Hi. -Hello. -May I see I.D., please? -Yes. I'm 30. They sell wine. Yeah? Let me see. -Looks like shit. -Yep. Fits in with the spirit. -Ready to go? -Yeah. I'm sure they're right. They're -- They've told him it's an aggressive tumor. And they've told him it's about extending his life, about -- about quality of life at this point. -How long of a time do you think that gives him? Karen?! Do you still see it?! It's -- it's way gone. Come on back. We do this all the time. Yeah, I don't think we should do anything special or talk about it. If he wants us to talk about it, we should talk about it. But if he wants to ignore it on this trip, then we should respect that, too. You know, it's probably the last time we'll have together. Last week he told me that he thinks he's going to be healed by God. Really? But if that's what he needs to believe to feel better, then...that's fine. He's got some hard months ahead. Let's go. Actually, I do like it better in terms of just kind of being on it and not seeing traffic rushing at you. -That's true. -And being able to actually see a bridge while you're on a bridge. Ah, so you can see water on both sides. That's true. -Hey, yeah. -Yeah, water on both sides. Wait, why aren't you buckled up? If I'm gonna die by going off of a bridge... -I agree. -...my seatbelt... I don't want to have it on, because what if we drowning and then I can't get out? -I'd be right there. -Who will save you all? Me. I will save you. -No, 'cause you... -Are the pyramids concrete? The pyramids are definitely not made out of concrete. Oh, yeah. Who invented the concrete? -The Romans. No, the Romans. -Oh, the Chinese got gunpowder. -Yes. -The Romans got concrete. What about the aqueducts? Those are concrete. -That's the Romans. -But I'm saying, I'm -- I'm on your side. -I know. I used to want to build these. Uh, giant bridges across ocean? Well, large or small, any of them. It's -- just before. That just didn't work out so you decided to become a writer? No, I decided... No, yeah. It didn't work out. Trigonometry was not -- well, no, calculus was harder. Trig was okay. But I just stopped. Yeah, put on your seatbelt. But I didn't do the last one! Why do I have to have a seatbelt on now? I was just going along with Alex. How about if I do this? That's... Oh. Oh, so you get decapitated. Now it's on my back. I can't find the keys. You don't need them. Jason's already in. You got that stuff? Yeah, I'll take -- I'll take the groceries. -Hey, there. -Hey, you! -You look beautiful. -Thank you. -You got the keys? -Hey! You look good. Thanks. I feel good. Yeah. God's doing a whole lot. With that whole thing. Yeah. Thanks for your prayers. Sure. What's your, uh, what's your dad got you up to lately? Papayas. That's one of the better ones. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. -What is that until... -He's growing papaya trees in the backyard. Mm-hmm. -Of course. Of course. -Yeah. It's good times. I'm glad you're here. It's good to see the two of you. You're, uh, together. It's beautiful. It really is. Oh, it's warm. Is it plugged in? And this is hot. Uh, let me turn it on. Is this mine? I almost hit -- I almost hit... It's disgusting! ...hit one of those birds coming over the bridge. -Oh. -Yeah. I was like swerving, I almost went over the bridge. That was -- that -- that's nothing. You got to hear this. It's almost -- it's almost too gross to tell at a restaurant, but... We're done. We're done. Go on. Two -- two years ago, I was in, uh, in Nevada with a friend from medical school, right? And we were late, and we were sort of driving through the desert at, like, must have been around midnight. Maybe even a bit later. And, you know, the desert cools down at night. So the -- the desert's real cold, but the road traps the heat. So the -- the road's the warm place. So all the hares come from the desert and they -- they lie down in the road. And so you're driving through and your headlights... -Uh-oh! -All you see is, like, all these bunny rabbits all across the road. You know, like... You know, you can see, like, 50 at any one moment. Flying through, and -- and you have two choices. Either -- either you -- you drive at, like, 20 miles an hour and honk the horn and put on your bright lights, or you just... -Which any... -...or you just -- just go. And we -- we were in a bit of a rush. Massacre! You didn't even honk your horn? Well, would it have done any good? They had places to go! -Oh. -Oh. I ran over a humongous cat once. -Thank you. -That was -- That was definitely... He was here. -Yeah. You can't... -It was just as sad. It was sadder. Oh, I'm sorry. What do you guys want to do tomorrow? -Hmm. -Um... Why don't we go to the Wright memorial? -Okay. -No. What do you guys want to do tomorrow? -No. -Have you ever done it? No, and let's keep it that way. I've been in an airplane. Good enough. You haven't been in a bronze airplane that's stuck to the ground. That's true. I -- I've never gone there. You know something I've never done, is, uh, see the sun rise at the beach. Oh. You mean, not here on the Outer Banks. -No, I mean ever. Anywhere. -Oh. -Really? -We have to do that. We'll do that. -Yeah. -Yeah. And it gets us until, when, 8:00. We're done with that. We still have the whole day. Yeah, but you only get one... Let's watch this and go with... No! We want to go to Ocracoke! We want to go to Ocracoke. -Okay. -Yeah, yeah. -Sounds good. -All right. Say it again? Ocracoke. That's a plant. So I'm always the last one to hear. The book. What's going on? Yeah, um... Well, I sent -- I sent off the manuscript to several agents. And, uh, I ended up choosing one who I'm fairly comfortable with. Um, and so we signed -- we signed up. -Yeah? -Yeah. -That's great. -Yeah, uh... -Fantastic. -It feels a lot better than it did a couple weeks ago, when -- when we didn't have it. Um, we've been kind of feeling the crunch with the post-wedding bills. Um... So it's -- it's nice. Yeah. -Congratulations! -Thanks. Thank you. -You deserve it. -Thanks. -It's high tide this year. There's hardly any beach. The family in the A-frame had to move out. Yeah? They're gonna knock it down. Are they at least rebuilding? -So what'd you talk about? -Not much. Do you know where my toothbrush is? You put it in the bathroom. I heard Jason talking to himself. "The one thing in life." "Wherever I go now, I lie down on my own bed of straw and bury my face in my own pillow." "I can stop in any city I want to and pull the stiff blanket up to my chin." "It's easy now. Walking up a flight of carpeted stairs and down a hall, past the painted fire doors." "It's easy bumping my knees on a rickety table and bending down to a tiny sink." "There is a sweetness buried in my mind." "There is water with a small cave behind it. There is a mouth speaking Greek." "It is what I keep to myself. What I return to. The one thing that no one else wanted." I don't think I get it. You do? Let's go to sleep. Hit the light. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, God. Bless the lord, oh, bless. Bless the lord. Bless the lord. And all that is within you, bless his holy name. Yes. Bless the lord, oh, my soul, forget not all his benefits, forget not all his benefits. Who forgives all my sins, heals all my diseases, redeems my life from the pit. Alex has definitely... changed a lot more this year. I was thinking that, too. He seems different from how it... -Yeah. -Yeah. I mean, even his clothing is slightly less pressed. It is. I think that's a good way to describe him: -...less pressed. -Less pressed. Probably a little bit to do with, you know, you and Karen. Just like seeing the two of you guys get married. I think it's affected all of us. Especially at the wedding, you know? It's just beautiful, and so... I think he's sort of looked at his life a little bit. I think we all did. I think it was also maybe you. I don't really talk to, uh, well, the old crowd, you know? I just can't really talk to everybody right now. Yeah. I'm so sick of, like, people calling me because they think it's the last time they're gonna talk to me. What is that? It's like they're defeated. I just don't have time for that. Yeah. Earth's crammed with heaven and every common bush afire with God. But only he who sees, takes off his shoes. Where'd you learn that? You. I learned it from you. Salt is the only thing that lasts on this island. It gets into the hair, into the eyes, into the clothes, into the wood, into the metal. Everything is going to disappear here but the salt. I like to think of myself turned to salt and all that I love turned to salt. I like to think of coating whatever is left with my own tongue and fingers. I like to think of floating again in my first home... ...still remembering the warm rock and its slow destruction... ...still remembering the first conversion to blood and the forcing of the sea into those cramped vessels. Man, it's getting windy. -Beautiful waves, though. -Mm-hmm. We should go swim in there. Oh, I got the key. This light -- do you think this light's out? Did that work last night? It just takes a while. Here, I'll -- I'll try this one. Huh. This switch doesn't work either. Does that one? Hmm. Where's the fusebox in this house? It's, um... I bet it's over by the bedroom. -Yeah. No, it's in the kitchen. -Let me get a flashlight. Right. -It's romantic. -There you go. Because we want to get the scent out of all of them. Oh, I can't get a flame on mine. Got to go to the source. Come on. I don't know if this counts as a ghost story, but, uh... my father actually told me a story one time. And he -- he -- he -- and he's not the kind of guy who makes stuff up, I mean, ever. He, you know. He never exaggerates for anything. Um, but he told me once, when they were still living in Kingston in this really big apartment complex, um, before it got rough, you know, uh, real communal environment. And, uh, he and this girl were really tight. And I'd heard him mention before that she had actually been killed, really bad situation. At that time, that didn't -- didn't really happen very much. Um, his parents went to be with the family. And I guess they were making arrangements. And he came back to the, uh, apartment complex alone. And, uh... yeah, he swears on this. The girl that was killed, his friend, um, he saw her figure in the courtyard, saw her dancing circles, just dancing. And he just stood there, watching. And he never says anything like that. And, uh... I just can't imagine he would make that up. -This feels so good. -Yeah? Yeah, get back in shape. Yeah, if you want to get back in shape, then I'm not sure running's the right thing. It's a start. You know what I mean? Yeah, but, you know, why don't you choose something that you're actually gonna do? You know, just go for a walk. 5 times a week, 30 minutes a day, that's all you need. -I mean... I just really feel good. I'm gonna get serious. What are you doing? -I run. Are you really gonna do it? -Yeah. I'll see how I feel. -I -- I have never seen you run before my whole life. Used to make fun of me when I went out with my running shoes back in college. And now you're telling me you want to go for a run. -That's 'cause you wore spandex. I'm not gonna run far. You know what I mean? I just want to... I just want to... I -- I just want to get moving. I hate sitting inside. I want to get moving. -Yeah, let's go out. You want to go running today? -Cool. -Hey, good morning, sleepy head. -Good morning. Would you sirs like any more coffee? -No thanks. I'm all set. -I'm good. -Okay. -So you still think that bed's too soft? -Yeah. I don't like it that much. Hurts my back a little. Let's go out there on the deck. -Don't even! I made you a present. -No, he doesn't trust me. -No! -I wasn't gonna do anything to you. I was just gonna give it to you. -Whoa! -Come on! -Come on, man! -Who lives in this castle, anyway? -We do. -We do? -I've brought topiaries. -Oh, man. What's this right here, Jason? -Uh...this... is an amphitheater. -Oh! -That's cool, actually. -Yeah, and I'm gonna put some tiers in here. -Uh-huh. -For the seating. And I'm trying to make the stage. So the actors... -That's nice. -And the players will be here. -I can make the people for your stage. Look, look! Little grass people. -The people are us. We live in this city. -It's us. -I'm also building a sports arena. We can't have two sports arenas in one castle. -No, that's a theater. -This is for... -Oh, it's for theater. -Yeah. -So we can do all that gladiator stuff over here. -Yeah, no gladiator stuff here. -Okay. -This is only.... -That's good to know. -I would love to live in this city back then. Nice. -Yeah. I bet it would b-- it would be real nice until there's a siege. Half your family gets killed by war. And then... -I've got -- I've got walls up. -Okay. But then the other half of your family dies from plague and pestilence. I think most people don't know that. That actually cities, you know, wasn't that they were constantly under siege and that everyone died in war. They actually didn't really fight that often in the cities. And, you know, some generations, it's, like, 60% of people died in the plague. Or even just dysentery. That was a common household thing, to lose two or three kids to dysentery. Now, these are just -- they're just diseases of progress. Everyone moves to the cities. Suddenly, they have work. They have enough food. And then the plague hits. -I'm gonna take a shower. Hi. -Wait. -What? -Wait. I think they're back. -Hmm. -Hmm. -It's not them. -Okay, good. -I think this goes, like... Watch your head. ...this. And this fits in this. And two planks in between them. Maybe these. Right? -These go on the bottom? -Yeah. -Right. -Yeah. -I think... See, they go in between here. Yeah. Something like that. -Mm-hmm. Just push, uh, just steady push a little. Thanks. That's fine. That's -- that's steady enough. -Do you know what this is for? -Yes, I do. -It's for -- it's for our little peanut. -Yes. -And he will sleep there every night until it's 18. That's okay. -Just put your side. And I'll do this side. -But there's something that might need to be fixed before we finish the middle. -What? -I think that corner. -What about it? -It's not in. -Yeah, I know, but... -It's best to use corners. -You're right. -Whoa! -Shit. -I don't think that's the next piece. -It goes right here. -Yeah, but... -I'm just looking to see how it works. -Okay. -This... Hmm. Okay. -The manual says to do these pieces first. -I know that. That's fine. -You know, I can do this myself. I -- I don't mind. I -- I want to do it. -You want to do this yourself? -Yeah, I don't want to do it this -- the style that you're doing it. I want it to go slow and enjoy it. -You -- you want... -So it's fine. I'll do it. -I just... Okay. Um, I don't think you can, all the way through right now. -Well, that doesn't show a lot of faith in me. -Okay. I'll watch -- I'll watch you do this bit. Would you like me to hold that for you while you do the thing that you know you're supposed to do? -Yeah, now, get the other one. Oop! Sorry. Okay. Now get me some of these. -I could help you, but I'm holding this because you told me to hold this. -It's not those. Can we please just do this without fighting? -Yes, I have no problem doing it without fighting. I just want to do it. -Just be a little gentler. -Fine. -That's okay. -You're gonna rub your knuckles. -Go slow. Hold on. Let's go like this. -Our little person will be a very good swimmer. You dressed up? -Yeah, I -- I thought I would look nice tonight. -What time are they coming? -Around 7:00. And so I'm feeling guilty about finding someone else attractive. And then I realize it is Mark. And I'm awful. -Oh, my God. -But I was really excited. I was like, "Yay, he's still really hot and sexy!" But this has happened to me numerous times, actually. -It was getting so bad that I -- we go out to dinner, saying she's -- if she saw a pregnant woman, she'd start to cry. And we couldn't -- we couldn't even finish dinner. -Oh, no. -And it happens, you know, several times. -S-so you just stayed home. -Yeah. -Oh, man. -It was depressing. -Thank God it worked out. -It did. I mean, you know, we -- we... My friend told me about a place in -- in Iceland. I, uh, what was it called? In vitro clinic. -Why Iceland? -They have, uh, supposedly, a wonderful in vitro clinic. I -- I'm not familiar with the ins and outs of... -So if it hadn't all worked out, you'd be up in some, like, snowy fertility clinic? -Yeah. -Oh, my God. Well, so are you ready for everything to change? -Am I ready? -Ready to actually gonna have -- actually have to wake up in the morning. -Yeah. -Can't sleep till noon. -Yeah. I sleep -- I don't sleep till noon. I sleep till, like, 10:00. That's my normal. But... -Yeah? -I-It will. It'll be different. I'm -- I like just writing, thinking about the next story, um, going to this -- this wonderful café nearby. Um, I get a lot done, I think. -Yeah. -Other writers are there. It's just a really comfortable place. I spend most of my day there. -I don't remember the last time when I sat down to drink a cup of coffee. Just not a doctor's life. Man. Yeah, I'm jealous. I hope someday I have the chance to slow down a bit more. -Yeah. I hope so, too. -I -- I suddenly just wanted all the things that we talked about, like, this full life that we had planned. And I was worried that I was gonna leave him. And I -- I don't know. It was -- it was really weird. -Yeah, something changes when you have someone to live for, I think. -Yeah, I mean, the -- the -- the reason I don't want to die young is, uh, because I don't want her to marry another guy. Um, I -- I -- I know she could do better than me. And, uh, I just, uh, don't want her to realize that. -I thought you just didn't want her to have sex with anyone else. -That's exactly what I'm talking about. Even -- even -- even the thought of that, uh, drives me crazy, you know. -Sam's ready for more wine. -We've just started. -He's always ready. -I can't wait to have wine again. -I'm sorry. -Soon, very soon. All right. This is from Yo and Kyoko. -Please. -Oh, what is this? Is that a squid? -Um... -Uh... -Looks like a mushroom. No, no, no. -Is it a blanket or one of those little snuggly things? -It's a blanket. -Oh, it's beautiful! -I like the color. -Yeah. Does that mean we're gonna have a boy? -It doesn't matter. -Or... -They can have any color they want. -An androgynous girl? -Or androgynous boy is fine. -Let's see what it is. Oh, it's a flying heart! -Aw. -That's very sweet. -That's better than squid. -Yeah. -I kind of like squid, too. I'll settle for the heart. -That's very nice. Oh, that's great. It reminds me of a children's book. -Thank you. -Sure. -Kind of illustration. Thank you. -It cost us $2,000. -$2,000? I'll have to give you something. -All righty. This is from you guys. Do you want to pull the other side of the bow? -Yes. I'm folding. But yes. -Okay. I won't wait for you. -I'm sorry. -Okay. It's one of these. -It's stuck. -Yeah. -It's something that's silver. -Who's it from? -It's from Alex and Lillian. -Oh. Tempting. -Ooh, it -- it makes noises. -Wow. Oh, wow. Isn't that beautiful? -This is your selection, Lillian? I assume? -I had nothing to do with it. It was Alex. -Wow. -Really? -Way to go, doc. -Wow, good choice. Pretty. -Mm-hmm. -Thanks, guys. -Congratulations, both of you. -Thank you, guys, very much for coming. -Sure. -Of course. -It means a lot. Is the smoke getting to you? Sorry. I was just thinking that I, um... ...I don't even remember Jason's face anymore. Hey. You know what I was reading today? I saw that there are numerous cases of malaria outbreaks along the eastern coast. They found several down in Hatteras, in Jersey. It's really weird. We'll have to uptake our gin and tonic. That way, uh... What's up? How was your day? -What the hell's going on? What's up? What's going on? It's all right. It's okay. -This morning, I -- I found blood in my underwear. -What? How much blood? -Let me see it. We need to go to the hospital. -I'm sorry. -We need to go to the hospital. -I just need a minute. I just need to pull myself together a little bit. -Mm-hmm. -Should we transfer to the C at Jay Street? -No, I think we can take a cab. I made it with cardamom. -Thank you. -"I am sick of the spirit of Lindbergh over everything." -Can -- can we skip it tonight? -I'd like to go back to the beach house soon. -Yeah. I'd like that. The last time we were there was with Jason. Do you remember? He died so soon after that trip. -Hey. -Hi. -Welcome to the studio. -Thank you. -These are beautiful. -Thank you. Thanks so much. It's all made right here. -How much? -Um, $18.95. And that comes with the scroll that I think you were reading. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Do you make a lot of them? -I do. Uh, they're very popular, very popular, about 75 a week. -Hey. -Hey. -I want to get this one. -Oh, great. Terrific. Let me get you the scroll, too. -Okay. Is that the, uh, one from the wall? -Yeah, it comes with that. It's kind of fun. Why don't I wrap that up for you? -Okay. Hey, I really appreciate the, uh, the article. -Oh, thank you. -Yeah. -Yeah. Um, that's what I had to go through. -I'm, uh, I'm actually gonna be starting chemo in a couple weeks, 2 1/2 weeks. -I know where you're at. Got to be strong. And you're not alone, you know. Oh, so you stay strong, okay? I'll be praying for you. -Thank you. -Are you here relaxing before you... -Mm-hmm. -Well, good. -Well, I'm just hanging out with my friends. -Good. -Um, we come -- we come here every year, so... -Great. -That's $20.23. -♪ You know, I think they're always best ♪ ♪ Playin' my bones ♪ -♪ Like xylophones ♪ -♪ Like xylophones ♪ -♪ Playin' my bones ♪ ♪ Like xylophones ♪ Here it comes.

It'll be really, really mushy. -I don't want... I like this place and... -Great. But, yeah, you -- you like it 'cause your aunt's put the money into it. That's why. -I don't know if I need to put the kind of money that she's been putting into it. And I just think I have a simpler vision of what this place is. -A romantic vision of living in, uh, this artist's paradise then? -Yeah. -Well, I'll come visit... ...for a week a year. But I wouldn't want to live down here. That's for sure. -I wouldn't want to live here permanently or anything like that. But I'd like to have it. I'd really like having a place like this to go to. And I like, you know... I mean, you're right. It's romantic. But I think that that -- that's a positive. You know, living out in an area where, obviously, it seems like it could kind of almost collapse, um... ...and maybe not buying insurance, something. I don't anything about these -- these insurance quibbles. But I kind of would like to kind of have a place where you don't have that. -It sounds romantic until the day the hurricane comes and knocks it over. -Right. Well, as long as I wasn't inside of it, maybe that would be okay. -But then it's gone. -Right. -It's the same rule as the corn? -Yeah. You know, I think you're a pretty good cook. -Dinner's ready. -If you found a live one, like, there was -- there was, like, a rule, you throw it back. I guess that's what you're doing. You're not gonna eat it. -A rule -- a rule of humanity? -You would... No, there was all these people, like, gathering around because they would see this lady that I saw. And then they -- they would see us with the conch shells. And they'd be like, "Oh, what's going on here?" And then they would, like, sort of hang around, like, look what we were doing. And every time the tide would, like, roll back, we'd all, like, scoot towards the shore. He was, like, it was a little vicious, you know. If you saw one, you would dive for it. I'm serious. It was intense. This young couple came by. They looked like they're from, you know, New York or something. They're all trendy. And he was, like, asking me questions. And I'm like, "Yeah," giving 'em short answers. You know what I mean? -"Get out of my sight." -'Cause, you know, you see, like, one every, like, few minutes. So, yeah, I got, like, four. I wanted to get some more, though. The beautiful ones were the ones that were still living. Anytime I saw one with, like, purple hue and white, I'd reach for it and grab it. But then you'd see the -- the meaty flesh inside. And you're like, "Okay." So you throw it back as far as you can. And, um, all the -- the darker-colored ones are the ones I ended up with. But they're still really beautiful. It's neat. I'm glad it happened today. You need some more of this. Last drop. -Oh. You know, so, actually, I had something I want to tell you guys. Guess now is the time. So, just before I left New York, I went out and bought a ring. I'm gonna ask Lillian to marry me next week. -Wow. -All right! -That's great. -Hope she says yes. -Of course she's gonna say yes. I knew he had something... -Mm. -Something brewing since the weekend began. -When did you decide this? -What do you mean? When -- when did I buy the ring? -No. When did you decide that you wanted to get married? -I mean, I've been thinking about it probably since the moment I met her. Somehow, it just, uh, it felt right. -Mm-hmm. -Felt right. I'm a doctor now. Now, I... Somehow I always thought that I had to get the career nailed down first and then, you know, when I was 40, think about wife and family. But -- but now that I have Lillian, I just feel like, you know, I can't imagine doing it without her. Yeah. -Does she know it's coming? -I mean, of course she does. -All right. Here we go. -All right. Come on. Come on, USA. -Get back, Whitney. -Come on. -Get away! G-- -Here. -Get away! Get away! -Yay! -Watch. -Take cover. -I like that. I like what's happening right now. -I'm disappointed. You're just disappointed? -It's not over! -Just smoke. -That's good. -That's just very disappointing. -All right. I'm getting the next one. -Get outta there. -Whoa! Something's... -Ah, see, that's cool. -I like that. -Aw. -It's like the last one. -No, it's better. -That's the Georgia Peach? -That was definitely better. -I guess it's a little better. -I kind of wish this one did stop for a second. -Gonna go up. -I want this one to stop. -Whoa! -Whoa! -I am able to zero in on these days with more clarity now so that not one detail is lost, as if the clarity illuminated the pain, as if the pain decreased where the clarity took over, as if the clarity were taking the place of the pain. ♪ Great is thy faithfulness ♪ ♪ Great is thy faithfulness ♪ ♪ Morning by morning ♪ ♪ New mercies I see ♪ ♪ Whatever I have needed... ♪ ♪ Great is thy faithfulness ♪ ♪ Glory is mine ♪ -Actually, if it rains next year, that's when you should be fishing. Show the locals what's up. -Fish in the middle of the lake while it's raining? -I mean, go bayside, you know? Like that one spot that we found at sunset? I'd love to build something, too, you know, something small, maybe where no one else will find it. But we know where it is, above the paths. -We could go down to the -- the Kill Devil Path, down to the trees, that bike path. -Yeah. -That's pretty isolated. -Many moons. Okay. -Oh, come on. Got to think. What does the woman want? She's definitely... Oh, come on. I think she'd love it. I don't know about Lillian diving off the coast of, -...you know, New Zealand. -Oh, I think... Well, maybe not New Zealand, but, like, Thailand maybe. Dude, this is what I'm talking about, going the other direction. All right. It's time to pack. "But he, the rain god, is sobbing uncontrollably. Sick drops are coming from his eyes. And he is gasping. And, finally, his arms alone are moving. And he is in the center of a huge circle on his hands and knees, pounding the earth. Dry gasps are coming from his throat and a trickle of thin water from his mouth... ...while, all around him, violets are springing up in the dirty cinders and giant thistles and strings of chicory and daisies to pay him for his tears, to pay the old god for his tears... ...apart from everything else, to pay him for his tears." When we were singing tonight and looking out into the ocean... ...I've never felt as empty as that. -Is everyone smiling? -Yes. Okay, here we go. Two, three... -Okay. -Yeah! -Okay. -All right, all right! Let's do it. Let's go right here. One more! I'm gonna get one more. With just Mark and Karen. -Okay. Okay. -And you kind of -- yeah. Smile big. One, two, three! -A lucky life is like this. -That's great. Lucky there is an ocean to come to. Lucky you can judge yourself in this water. Lucky the waves are cold enough to wash out the meanness. Lucky you can be purified over and over again. Lucky there is the same cleanliness for everyone. Lucky life is like that. Lucky life. Oh lucky life. Oh lucky, lucky life. Lucky life.
