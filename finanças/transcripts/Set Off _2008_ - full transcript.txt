Who on earth is chasing you? Have you found a place to stay? They called me already. I can deal with them. Don't worry. All right. I won't be back in a couple of days. I don't get it. The money is yours. Why are you hiding from them? Darn it, I'll look for them. - All right. - Welcome. Wait. Where is room number eight? Over there. Tell me the address and I'll jot it down. Tell me. Okay, let's meet up when I have the money. I love you, too. Hey. I just arrived. What? No. The restaurant belongs to both of us. He can't just sell it. Yes. Yes. Should I personally appear in court? Okay. I'll return as soon as possible. Excuse me. When is the last flight available to Cyprus? There's a flight at 2 a.m. Will that do? Okay, I'll take it. I want a round trip, open flight. - Did you just get off the plane? - Yes. - Are you sure you want to book this? - Yes, I'm sure. DIVORCE CERTIFICATE Take this back. Wei. Are you with him? Don't ask anything anymore. It doesn't matter now. Don't move. It's fake. It's only a prop. Why are you still a coward after so many years abroad? How did you know I'm back? Did Wei tell you? Don't mention that bastard's name. We're no longer friends from now on. He broke the bro code. Drink up. You're making fun of me. Sorry. I'm just kidding. Come on, drink up. You just came back. Why are you leaving again? I wanted to stay for a few more days. But I got a call as soon as I got off the plane. They said the shop was sold. I might lose my home on both sides. Don't worry, I'm still here. Come to me if it doesn't work out in Cyprus. When did you become a director? You must make a lot of money, right? Making money is not what matters. That's right. I'll let you meet some actresses. Don't. I get nervous around women. What's there to be nervous about? We're in the entertainment industry. How do you write that in Chinese? It's composed of the characters of women and nothing. Without the character of women, it's nothing. Hey. What are you doing? Drive! Drive! Do you hear me? Drive! Sorry, I'm being chased by some bad guys. - I'm sorry. - Yes. Sir. No. 2 North Lane, Dingfu District. Excuse me? Sorry, Miss. I can't do that. Can't you see I have a passenger? I'll drop you off somewhere far. So you can get another cab. This man has a plane to catch. Are you in a hurry? How about we give her a lift? It's late. Thank you. It's in the opposite direction. Don't blame me if you miss your flight. There's still time. We have more than three hours. What a fucking nice man. We're here. Wake up. - Do you have any plastic bags? - What? Don't throw up in the car. Here's some tissue... This is crazy. Give me your hand. Get out. What have I done to get into this mess? Hold her. Hey, that's my suitcase. I know. How can I still take you? You shouldn't have given her a lift. I need to clean the car before I return it. Hurry up, pay the fare. But I... Hurry up. Hey, Sir, please give me my change. You're paying for her too. Ask her to pay you back later. That won't cost RMB100! What about the cleaning fee then? Hey, Sir! It's cold out here. It's already late. Hey, Miss. Miss. Wake up. Go home and sleep there, okay? Hello. Where are you, Bao? I'm not Bao. Are you the phone owner's friend? Who are you? You don't know me. Listen. Your friend is drunk and fell asleep by the road. Can you come over? Where are you? Just outside her place. Where is it? Let me see. No.2. North Lane, Dingfu District. - Got it. Wait for me. - Okay, hurry up. Hey! What's wrong with you? Why can't you stand up? Which one? Here, you'll be home soon. Good. Who are you looking for? I'm sorry. Thanks. You're welcome. Put your legs up. Hey, Miss. Open the door. I have a plane to catch. My clothes and luggage are inside. Can you at least take out my clothes? I'm not going in, okay? Please. You can't do this to me, Miss. Open up. I'll miss the flight. I gave you a lift home. How can you do this to me? Why do you keep yelling? I'm telling you. Be quiet or I'll kill you. No, I... Be quiet. Hey! It's dark. Miss. Open up, please. My flight is at two o'clock, and it's midnight already. You're here. You're here. Nice body. Which flat is it? Over there. - Open the door. - Hey, be quiet. I know you're there, Xia. - Open up. - Be quiet. You're still not done yet? You've got help. So you won't listen to me? - Hey. - Open up. Okay. Wait a second. - Hey. - Open the door. Didn't I make myself clear? You won't listen to me? My gosh! What are you doing? - Somebody's trying to kill me! - What? - Who? - It's the two of them! Beat them up! Run, Wu. Go. Get them. Stop, you two! Open the door, Miss. If I miss the plane, my shop will be sold. Come on, Miss. Open up. It's a mess out here. Miss. Why didn't you run? Sir. I... Did I ask you to stand up? If you let me go now, I can still catch the flight. Sit down. Well... How much did you drink? I didn't drink. How come you smell of alcohol? It's from the girl. Which girl? The girl in the flat unit. Which one? The neighbors said there's no one inside. There is. This won't happen if no one's inside. Who is this person? The girl in the flat unit. What is your relationship with her? None. I don't know her. You don't know her? It's already late and you're almost naked. What are you doing outside her door? I was asking her to open up. My luggage and passport are inside. Didn't you say that you don't know her? Yes. Yes, that's right. What's your relationship with your two accomplices? Which two accomplices? The neighbors said you asked them to come. I did, but they're not my accomplices. I don't really know them. Mr. Cui. Look. You brought along two men whom you don't know to beat up a stranger and tried to get into the house of a girl who you don't know - to retrieve your luggage. - Yes. If you were me, would you believe this? No. Try again. I'm the leader. I told the director I'd be back soon. I've done my part. He keeps pushing. My son's in trouble. I'm sorry, it's an illegitimate child. Don't worry, I'll be back once I'm done... Hey. You're making fun of me again. They need me in everything they do. The director is complaining. - Didn't you say you're the director? - Well... Well, didn't you say you're abroad? - How come you're here? - Look at that guy's clothes. I would've brought you some clothes if I'd known. Let's go. Pick one. Hey. That's off-limits. Pick anything aside from that. How come all the clothes are from the Qing Dynasty era? Wasn't Jing Ke from Qin Dynasty? TV series aren't that meticulous. How can I wear this? THE HISTORY OF JING KE ANCIENT DETECTIVE He's crazy. Miss. Hello. Who is this? Who is this? Why do you have my cell phone? Are you the girl from last night, Xia? Yes. When did you take my cell phone? I didn't. I just slipped it in my pocket by accident. I can return it to you now. Open up. I'm right outside your home. My home? Yes. I'm not at home. What? Where are you? Hurry up and come back now. I'll return your phone, while you return my luggage. Why are you talking in such a sneaky manner? I'm not sneaky. I just can't talk loud. Hurry back. No. You want to get your luggage back? Give me the phone first. I'll check if you are a bad guy. I have a situation right now. Forget it. I don't need the phone. No. All right. Where are you? I'll come meet you, okay? Just tell me where you are. I am very easy to see. All right. He's a cop too. He's our senior. - Hey. - Are you there yet? Yes. I'm here. Where are you? I'm around the area. I can't see you. Where are you? Which one are you? I'm the one on the phone on the overpass. Jump up and down so I can see you. Do you see me? - Okay. - All right? All right. Good. Hello. This is your phone. The Chinese from overseas like to wear such outfits? No. How do you know that I'm from overseas? You took me home last night, right? Yes. You were drunk last night and threw up all over me. Good thing your friends called you. My friends? Yes. You set me up! Hey! Hey! Don't run. Excuse me. Is this the ladies' room? Can you help me, ma'am? Stop! - Hey, Miss, why are you running away? - Perverts are so bold nowadays. Stop! Don't run! Look at how righteous they are. Look how smart I am. Don't come near me. I have a bomb. Cut the crap. Put the cuffs on her. We finally got you. Don't move. You're such a fucking jerk! You're good. You can still run away even when you're drunk. - It seems like I can't treat you nicely. - Can't treat you nicely. Go away, you jerk! Let me go! You'll be dead if Bao finds out. I'm so scared. Bao? I'm looking for him too. Where is he? You should know better. You should tell me where he is. Are you trying to fool me? You really think I can't get it from you? Take her away, Wu. Let me go! Hey! Where are you going? Bring me along. Xia, my luggage! To hell with you! Is that man your friend? Yes, he's my new boyfriend. Honey, go. Don't mind me. What are you talking about? You have good taste. Let me go, Guang. I'll leave him with you as collateral. He's my new boyfriend. He's from overseas and has lots of money. Forget about Bao. Don't listen to her. I may have citizenship abroad, but I'm not rich. Look at my shoes, pants, and undershirt. I bought them here a few years ago before I left. So I'm definitely not rich and I'm not her boyfriend. Last night... Honey, stop pretending. - We're already here. - What honey? That's bullshit! How can you turn me away? You promised to be with me in bad times. You just love your money! What's more important, money or me? Neither. I never promised you anything. I'm not your boyfriend. You are! Your surname is Cui. You came from Cyprus. You're selfish! I'm not selfish, I'm not from Cyprus, and my surname is not Cui! Are you two done? Have you had enough? Are you done? You two don't want to stop. What's that? What are you doing? - My hand is cold. - Take it out. - My hand is cold. - Take your hands off. Let go! Are you calling the cops? You've dialed 911. Fuck you! You're really from overseas. Did you lose your brains? Guang, 911 is the firemen hotline. Who lost his brains, him or you? You damn fool. Search them. What do you want? What are you doing with my keys? - Put them down. - There's nothing else. - Everything's gone. - All gone? - What's this? - That's a tissue paper. - What's this? - It's used. I want it anyway. Call Bao now. His phone is turned off. I couldn't reach him. Fine. You're tough. If I can't starve you to death, I'll freeze you to death! We'll freeze you to death. - There. - Hey! There are two tigers... You two jerks! Come back! You'll die a horrible death! I hope you get hit by a car or choke while drinking water! Come back! I beg you, please let me go! Let us go! Let you go? They wouldn't catch me and bring me here if it wasn't for you. I'm here because of you. It's all your fault! Stop kicking me! If it wasn't for you, would I get locked up here? If it wasn't for you, would I be naked and freezing here? That's Wu. That's Guang. Stop. What's his name? He is Bao. Bao? We see Bao every day. When did we see him? How much do we owe him? A few ten thousands. What for? That's the accumulated amount in five years. Our lives are ruined just because of a little money. Put more force into it. Be patient. Be patient. Come on. - My belly. - What? Hold it. My belly is stuck! Hold it in. I can't. Put more force into it. Stop pulling me. I'm human, made of flesh and blood. Do you want to escape or not? If you stay here, you won't remain human! Come up. Come up. Wait. Come up. Good. One, two, three. My hand is stuck. What are you doing? The phone. - Why do you still care about that? - The SIM card too. Put more force into it. Help! Is anybody out there? Help! Help! Is anybody there? I have an idea. I've seen it in movies. Wrap the iron bar with wet clothes, twist it with a stick and it will bend. Take it off then. Me? How can I do that? What? Don't look at me. I have nothing to take off. I'm so unfortunate to have run into you. Red socks? How old are you? This is my birth year. Are you 48 years old? - I'm 36. - What? Cut it out. Hurry up! We have to get it wet. What? My gosh. Hurry up! Don't disturb me. I haven't had a drop of water since last night. Come on, wrap it around. Come, let me unlock it. Darn it! The money is gone. What about the clothes? The clothes are still here. Put them on then. I have such bad luck! I flew back for a divorce. I was told that my shop was sold. I had to rush back, but I bumped into you. Darn, my passport is gone too. My passport is gone too. This is really too much. How can I go back without it? This is all too much. Those guys are despicable. It's okay if they took the cash, but why the passport? Cut it out! It's all your fault! If I didn't go back within four days, I'd lose my shop, my home. I've got nothing left. That was between you and them. Why did you drag me in? Did I drag you in? You meddled in it yourself. - Where are you going? - I'm calling the police. - Are you mad? - You are. I've lost my money and passport. - You won't let me report to the police? - Are you really in a hurry? Of course. Think about it. You have nothing. Would the police believe you? Also, even if they solve the case and get your passport back, you won't make it on time. Yes. You're right. Listen. This is the key to a locker in a bathhouse. Do you know why they're after me? My boyfriend Bao opened an automobile repair shop together with Guang. Guang had been stealing Bao's money. Recently, Bao took back his money. So Guang kept harassing him. The money is in this locker. Wait a second. Sit down. How is that related to me? I plan to retrieve the money and run away with Bao. Considering what we've been through together, and since you are a nice guy, I've decided to surrender the money in trade for your passport. Thank you. But you have to go there. Why? It's in the men's locker room. Bao's phone is off all the time. Guang, where do you think that jerk hid the money? How would I know? Would the contractors come after us? They have men. If they come after us... Shut up. There's no more toilet paper, Guang. Guang? Guang? There's no more toilet paper, Guang. Guang? Guang? Guang... Wipe your ass. I don't have the money. The money is with Bao. Go to his girlfriend. Find her and you'll find Bao. Member area number 263, remember it. Welcome, Sir. Number 263. One gentleman. - Excuse me, Sir? - Number 263. I know. Please change your shoes first. Yes, tomorrow. I'll do it tomorrow. No problem. It's not a big deal. All right then. Wait for me. I'll come right over. How strange. It's fine a while ago. Is everything all right, sir? Everything's fine. - Is everything all right? - I'm fine. Please come over here. I'm on my way. How much? I'm asking how much you are. Go away. Let's go. Have a bath with me. Fuck off! You're throwing a fit? Let me teach you a lesson. Do you know what business I'm in? Honey. You got it? That's great! Let's go. The abalone is so delicious. Let's order another one. Waiter. We have to get my passport back. Waiter, bill please. What's wrong? There's not enough money? Sit down. What business are you guys in? You got the wrong bag. No way. You said Member area 263. - Where is the money? - I should be asking that question. Does this bag really belong to Bao? Are you stupid? If Bao has this, would he be afraid of Guang? You must have opened the wrong locker. I didn't. It's number 263 in the Member's area. The key didn't work. I forced it open. You forced it open? Hi, the total is RMB2,580. We want to order some more. Bring the bill later. Okay. I've become a felon after knowing you for less than a day. You've asked me to steal a gun. The problem now is how are we going to pay the bill? Even if the police don't arrest us, the cooks will kill us. Let's chip in. That pendant must worth something. No. It's more valuable than my life. It's my mom's dowry. It's for my ex-wife. Why are you wearing it? Like I said, ex-wife. - Will you listen to me? - No. Let's wait for the police then. Fine. Are you the manager? Yes. How are you? We're reporters from the Commercial Times. I'm Ji and that's our Deputy Chief. - Hi. - Hello. We received complaints from readers lately about food poisoning in many restaurants for unknown reasons. The consequences are very serious. We just returned from a business trip. We didn't intend to inspect secretly. It just happened coincidentally. Look. How can you be so careless? I'm so sorry. Get the bill. How much is it? Forget the bill. It's on the house. Breaking News The police has busted an organized crime syndicate which had engaged in fraud and burglaries. All major suspects were arrested. Whilst searching for the tools used in the crime, the police believe they were placed inside a locker that was pried open. The suspect pried open the locker and took away a black bag containing important evidence. According to a witness, the criminal had been very arrogant. The CCTV in the bathhouse captured the whole process of the crime and the face of the criminal. You're an idiot! Let's turn ourselves in. I heard that the policies are lenient for returned nationals. Help me analyze the situation. If I turn myself in, would I get a lesser sentence? Xia? She's here! Why is everybody after you? Get her! Go! - Quick! - Run! Hurry up! - Run! - Hurry up! NAMO AMITABHA Back off! You can't kill anyone in a sacred Buddhist place. You can't chase a woman in a sacred Buddhist place too. You rascals. Dude, are you from the hood? Do we know each other? What do you mean? No, we don't. We are not from the same hood. Okay, you may go. Leave the girl. She's important to me. No, she's more important to me. We all rely on her to make a living. I rely on her to go back home. Are you stupid? Can't you go home by yourself? Back off! Step back. Turn around. Get him! Thank you. You were so manly earlier. I learned it from the movies. Why are they after you? It must be the money. Let's stay here for the night. Let's wait for a while. When they're gone, I'll take you somewhere. What is this place? Bao and I used to live here. What is that other place? That's my friend's house. We take care of it for her. Make yourself at home. The water is there. Help yourself. Guang and Wu are so stupid. They never thought that we would be here. Xia, I got an idea on our way here. Tell me if you think it would work. Tomorrow, I'll return the gun to the bathhouse. Then I will call the police to inform them that the gun is there. It's a misunderstanding. With the gun there, they won't arrest me even if they don't believe me. If I can get the cash from the locker to trade for my passport, that would be even better. - Okay? - Okay. - You're going there? - Yes. - You're returning it? - Yes. Do you want to walk into a trap? Everyone in the bathhouse can recognize you. Yes. You're right. Hey? I thought of someone. Life is like a glass of bitter wine. People only see the good things that happen to me, but I've been hurt in love too... until I met you. Mr. Qun, I... You don't have to say anything. I understand. As artists, we all have a... vulnerable heart. I will take care of you forever. Pick it up, you jerk. Why are you swearing at me? Hey, it's Cui. Where are you? Are you still here or did you come back again? Don't ask. Where are you? I'll go there. Don't. I'm in a shoot. Come and see me tomorrow morning at the studio. All right. Where was I? What? Cui, will you leave after you get your passport tomorrow? Yes. Cyprus. What is it like in Cyprus? It's a nice place. It's warm there. Why did you come back? To get divorced, mainly. I've been running a restaurant there for seven years. I originally planned to make some money and bring my wife too. Some time ago, she told me that she's pregnant, but the child wasn't mine. Do you hate her? Not really. Things happen for a reason. She must have her reasons. You are too naive. How could your wife do this to you? You were working hard for her sake. Xia. How does Bao treat you? He's okay. We have a plan. When we get enough money, we'll open a hotpot restaurant. I love hotpot. Good. Xia. The money you'll trade for the passport is for the restaurant, right? Well, you don't have to worry about it. Xia, you're tough on the outside, but soft in the inside. You're actually a righteous person. Running into you is the best thing that can happen to me in this situation. Let's sleep. We have to wake up early tomorrow. By the way, wear Bao's clothes tomorrow so that people won't recognize you. Who is it? It's Cui Guoqing. You punk... What's the matter? - Why are you so early? - It's urgent. What's so urgent? We have a rule here. No outsiders are allowed. - Am I an outsider? - Wait, hey. - Let's go. - Get inside. I'm sorry, excuse me. This... This is my girlfriend. - Hello. - Mr. Cui. Hi, Mr. Cui. How are you? I'm sorry about this. This is Xia. - Hello. - This is Director Qun. Hi. Have a seat. What's wrong with your back? The pants are a bit tight. I need a favor. Aside from lending you money, I can help you. It has nothing to do with money. Can you go to the bathhouse and get something for me? I can't. I have a shoot. Why don't you go yourself? I wouldn't come to you if I could do it. How about her? It's in the men's area. Men... I'll find someone from the crew. No. It's between you and me and her. You go. I'm an artist, I can create something. There is a washroom on the left. You better put your things in there. Hey. The glasses. Remember, you're a man. - Okay? - Okay. All right. ARREST WARRANT I'm sorry. We are closed today. When will you open? I am not sure. We're temporarily closed. Okay. Ask that cop. If he says yes, you can take it. - Okay. - I can't do anything about it. If you remain closed, I can't get my things then. Come on, I know all of you. You are the prettiest and nicest. Talk to the cops and let me get my things, okay? Save your sweet talk. I'm in a hurry. That means a lot to me. That was fast. Did you get the money? I couldn't get in. It's closed and there are many cops inside. Don't worry. I got rid of the gun. What about the money? Let's see if there's a backdoor. Let's go. - Tomorrow morning... - It's the same here. I have to go inside. No, it's too dangerous. Let's try something else. No, I must go in no matter what. Xia. You're going through all these troubles just for my passport. I'm sorry. It's fine. I'll handle it. Xia. If you get caught, tell them about me. Let's share the guilt together. All right. Don't jinx it. You can talk to the police. Don't mention the ball. It will only make me cry. Hey. What are you doing? You're not allowed to go in, aren't you aware? It's a lighter, not a gun. - Put the gun down! Don't move! - Put the gun down. - Bring them out! - Put the gun down! - Don't move! - Stay there. Xia. When will we exchange this for the passport? Right away. You're so thorough. You even got the banknote-checker ready. Franklin, you old man. Because of you, we've gone through hell. What? Where is the smaller version? What smaller version? Look. There is a big head here. It should be a smaller version over there. There's no smaller version. It's fake. Look. They're all fake. Bao's been cheated. Give the money back! I have no money. I'm just a fucking contractor! Speak up. Pay me the cash that you owe me! Let's go. It's fake. Stop! Go after them! FORTUNE Stop! Over there！ Out of the way！ Stop! Move, I'm trying to catch a thief! Sorry, the number you have dialed cannot be reached. Where is Bao? They must be looking for me. I need to hide. Remember, number 263 at the Member's area. Don't be afraid. This is the debt that we collected today. I'll keep it. I deserve it after all these years. Remember, call me once you get the money. I'll wait for you at the motel. Don't go to Guang. Don't go home either. I'll explain everything later. I can guarantee, Xia. They don't know it's fake. Think about it. We'll hand over the money and get the passport. By the time they find out, it'll be too late. Let's get ready to go. Go to another city with Bao and open a hotpot restaurant. I will be back in Cyprus. When they find out that the money is fake, we'll be gone already. Xia? Xia? Are you Guang? - Yes. - I'm Cui. - Who's Cui? - The hanging man. - Hanging man? - Don't you want Bao's money? Let me tell you, the money is with me. I can return it now on one condition. What condition? Give me back my passport. - Passport? - Yes, the Cyprus passport. You guys are ridiculous! What good would it do you to steal the passport of an innocent man? All right. Where shall we meet? Who is it? It's me. What took you so long? The money's fake, Bao. What? I got the USD10,000. They're all fake. Are you kidding me? It's true, Bao. They cheated on you. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Let's... How did you get it? I got help from a friend. Friend? Who? Tell me! Bao. He must have swapped the money. No, he wouldn't do that! How do you know? Tell me! Listen. Cut the fucking crap. Bring the stuff back right away! Hey, hanging man. I just played a joke on you two last time. I knew you'd be able to get away. Are you mad at me? How lame. Here's the money. Where's my passport? Let me take a look first. Give me the money and I'll give you the passport. Get him! Get him! You dropped it. It's not my fault. Give me my passport. Dream on! Hurry up! Grab him! Grab him! Stop! Cut! Is the scene okay, Director? The acting was a bit stiff. As for the character's emotion... You shouted too early! I found it, Guang. I'm sorry, the fake money is gone. I didn't get the passport back either. The passport is with me all along. I'm sorry. Do you think you can get away with an apology? You're a liar. You're a big, fat liar. You used me. I get it now. You just used me. What did I do to you? Why did you use me? Why? I needed someone to help me out. I know that you're a nice man. You lied to me because I'm nice? Goodbye. Farewell. What did I do wrong? You still have the audacity to cry. Aren't you ashamed? Do you feel that you've been wronged? I'm the one who should be crying. Someone hid my passport. I can't go home and my shop is gone. I feel like crying, but I got no tears. I helped Bao get the money, but he hit me. That's none of my business. I returned the gun for you, but you yelled at me. What have I done wrong? It's all my fault. Everyone's blaming me. Don't cry, okay? Don't cry, all right? Here, drink some water. Stop pretending. Don't scare me. Xia? Xia? Are you her family? Yes. She's pregnant. She fainted because of anemia. Stress and alcohol were also factors. It's your responsibility to take good care of her. You're so much older. You should know better, right? Do you have money, Cui? Where did you get the money for the consultation? What do you plan to do with the baby? I don't know. I'll think about it. They say childbirth is painful, right? I don't have any experience. Cui, where's your pendant? Childbirth surely won't be painless. Where is the pendant? It shouldn't be too painful either. Did you sell it? Didn't you say it's more valuable than your life? My life is worthless. Where are you going? To get the medicine. It's right here. It's my ex-wife and her husband. Guoqing. What a coincidence. Guoqing. Long time no see. Do you know them? You're such a righteous person. Who are you? You're so rude. I'm with Guoqing. I'm his girlfriend. Wow, Guoqing. You just became single and you already got a pretty girlfriend. We've been together for a year, didn't he tell you? Don't look down on girls like me who like rich men. He's not a rich man. He's just an old man, at most. Older men are good. They're more caring. Guoqing cares a lot about me. He flies back whenever he is free. Hey, you're having a baby too. We can fix a match for our kids this time next year. Look at you. Your daughter would be beautiful. Who told you I'm pregnant with a girl? Who told you it would be a girl? I'll give birth to a girl! You'll see. No, I mean a son! I didn't say anything. Why is she mad? Don't get mad. All right. Let's go. How's that? Are you feeling better now? I'm not just a burden. That's enough. Stop pretending. You're smiling inside, right? I'm not telling you. Xia. I'm not coming up. Will you come back after signing the papers? Will they still come after you? They know that I don't have the money. What is this? It's for the baby. Take it. Guoqing. If you have time, can you come and make me dinner? I may not make it. Just say it. I'm sure you don't cook well. Bye. Guoqing. Can I ask you something? The suitcase is heavy. Why don't you pull it? It'll waste away the wheels. Go. Okay. Who is it? Guoqing. You said I don't cook well. Let me show you. The ending's so unexpected. It's so touching. Are you done? The book is touching. You're heartless, Guang. You shithead. Stop fooling around. I need to focus on pooping. Shut up! RECORDED CALL Happy Birthday to you... - Tell me. - Chundu Hotel, room 2006. Okay, let's meet up when I have the money. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Tell me. - Chundu Hotel, room 2006. Okay, let's meet up when I have the money. - I love you. - I love you too. Listen, you may not believe this, but the book is really touching. The ending is so unexpected. Everyone is dead. Guang? Wipe your ass. Guoqing, I wish everything would go well and you'd win the case. You can't drink. Why not? The baby. You know what? You have a strength. You're a coward. That doesn't sound like a compliment. You give people a sense of security. Guoqing. I want to abort the baby. My wife was pregnant before. If we kept the baby, we might not have ended up in divorce. What do you plan to do in the future? Who knows what'll happen in the future? Let's wait and see. No matter what happens, learn to be a good person. It would be such a shame otherwise. How come you sound just like my dad? Listen to me too. You must learn how to be a bad person. You're too honest. That's why people keep bullying you. I'll try my best. What kind of logic is that? This is for you. Why? This is my payment because Guang broke your phone. Go home. It's cold. I'll go to the airport with you. There's no need. If you go with me, something might happen again. Just let me go back in peace. You are so annoying. Why did you avoid it? I won't have another chance to kick you. Give me a hug. Fine. Go now. Bye, baby. Your mom has a bad temper. Don't make her mad. Make her happy every day and open a hotpot restaurant with her. When I return, I'll come work for you. That's enough. Go. Guoqing. Pull the suitcase. It'll waste away the wheels. You're wasting your energy though. I got a lot of energy. - Pull it. - Okay. What an idiot. Where is the money? Where is Guoqing? Who's this? Guoqing, don't come here. Go! Guoqing, Xia is with me. Come to the Penthouse within 40 minutes. Or else be ready to collect her body. Who are you? Take a wild guess. Hello? I'm here. - Are you alone? - Yes. - Did you call the police? - Of course not. Where's Xia? Look up. Go away, Guoqing! You're an idiot! Why did you come back? Guang. Hello again, hanging man. Guang. Are you Guoqing? Where is the money? Here it is. Let him go. He has nothing to do with it. Bao! I'm talking about the US dollars. Are you still putting on an act? Bao, the money is fake. He didn't take them. Shut up! Tell me, where are the USD10,000? How dare you try to flee abroad without giving me the money? - Wu. - Brother Guang, I've come for you. - What? - I'm coming to get you. - Let him go. - You liar! I've told you many times. Shut your mouth! She's pregnant, Bao. She's pregnant. - What? - She's pregnant. Fuck you! You took my money and slept with my woman too? - What are you trying to do? - You're a liar! - I'll deal with you when we get home... - You're a jerk! What on earth is this all about? You're a jerk, Bao. Where is the money? Speak up! Guoqing, I need the cash to save my business. That's all I've got. If you don't let me make my living, I won't let you live either. I really didn't take your money. Let go. No! Guoqing. Xia. You two don't want to live? Go down. You called the police? Those up there, listen up. - You're surrounded by the police. - Darn it. He really called the police. Release the hostage and surrender now. - Or we will make a move. - Guoqing! - We'll really do something. - Guoqing! - Wu. - You didn't expect it, right? Darn you. Go to hell. Hurry up! Go! Come out. The bad guys are gone. Hurry! Come out. Help! Somebody help us! Help! Somebody help us! Come help him! Hold them tight. Don't let go. Guoqing. Are you all right? Are you leaving or not? What's going on? Don't tell me they're gangsters. I can't deal with them. You think I can? That's why I went to you. You can call the police. Come on, this is your homeland. Trust the authorities. Didn't I have some unfinished business with the authority? I... Get in there. Boss, about my share... Hey. Don't. Don't do this. Guang. Bao. I've betrayed you. I should stick with you guys. I'm sorry. Guoqing. Will you still rebook your ticket? Yes. I'm tired. Stay with me. Can I come back and stay with you after the case is done? Guoqing. Look. There's something on it. What is it? It's some words. - "Provincial" - "Provincial" "Property." Look for 13B. It's 13B. It's 14B. That's not right. It's the mining route under the museum? - Let's call the police. - Let's call the police. Where are you going? Give me the money! Hey, what are you doing? Put the lighter down. Let her go. Get him! Boss. Boss. What's happening here? Stand there. You guys, come over here! Request for support. It's late. Why are you making so much noise? We got it, we're coming right away. Let's talk at the police station. Hurry. Did you call the police? I didn't. That serves you right. I'll call the police again the next time you make noise. What do you want? Sir. Thank you. What's wrong with him? They say that justice always finds its way. During the investigation of a noise disturbance complaint, the police unintentionally cracked down an armed kidnapping case. It is more surprising that behind this kidnapping lies a major conspiracy. The suspect Li Jianguo is already arrested. While renovating a museum two years ago, he drew an underground route to the Museum's Treasure Hall on a bunch of forged banknotes in order to cover his plan. The police has verified Li Jianguo's identity after his arrest. Li Jianguo was from Beijing... Attention please. Flight HCY928 going to Cyprus will be taking off soon. Passengers may start boarding at Gate 41. Are you Xia? Yes. Do you know this man? Guoqing. Why are you still here? The police called me to explain about the gun before I left. Good. Nobody knows that better than I do. Gosh, here comes my trouble again.
