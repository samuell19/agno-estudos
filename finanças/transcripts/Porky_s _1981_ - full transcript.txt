We lost. Come on. What do you think this is? What are you, a tough guy or something, huh? Evening, Morris. Howdy. You don't look too terrific tonight, brother. I'm okay. I understand you tried to butt heads with Porky. I'd have whipped him if it hadn't been for that sheriff. You know something? That scumbag sheriff sided with Porky. Yeah, well, that scumbag sheriff is Porky's brother. What? Shit. Just great. Now, just where were you headed? Back to Porky's. Listen, Junior, you go back and he kicks your ass again, what you gonna do? Go back. Just keep going back. This guy's dangerous. I mean, he's playing around with you now, but he's gonna get tired of you, then he's gonna hurt you bad. Am I gonna have to take you home myself? All right, I'm going home. [Engine Starts] Good night. Redneck. Do you think he's really going back? It runs in the family, I'm afraid. What's up? He wanted to go after Porky. Just hope he lives to outgrow it.

You're suspended indefinitely. Nobody who plays like that plays for me. Move. You all right, son? Yeah. Anybody wanna go fly a kite with me tonight? I think it's great weather for flying kites. I wonder if there are any kites around here we can fly. Hey, listen, Cavanaugh. It's not "kites." It's "kike." K-I-K-E. Kike. You know, you're too stupid to even be a good bigot.

How did you learn to fight like that? Listen, when you're Jewish, you either learn to fight or you take a lot of shit. I don't like to take shit, so I learned how to box, and I studied a little jujitsu. That Japanese stuff, right? Yeah. How often have you had to use it? Well, this was the first time. Were you sure you'd remember how? Well, I was hoping. [Chuckles] Look, Brian, Tim's our buddy, but you gotta understand he's got problems. Yeah, I noticed. See, it's real easy for him to take it all out on you, 'cause he thinks you're putting him down. He's not a bad guy. He's a prick. You're right. He's a prick. He's a schmuck. What? A schmuck. That's Jewish for prick, right? Yeah, sort of. Yeah, well. Anyway, even though he's a schmuck, and we don't like everything he does, but he's still our buddy, you know? Yeah. I understand. Well, listen, I got to go. Yeah. See you guys later. Take it easy, Brian. So long, Brian. [Engine Starts] This is great. I'm gonna get her. This is great. It's great, Meat. It's great.

What's his name? His name's Michael Hunt. [Laughing] Mike, Mike. Yes, Mike. Mike Hunt? Okay, just hang on a minute. Is Mike Hunt here? [Chuckling] Is Mike Hunt here? [Laughing] Has anybody seen Mike Hunt? Practically everybody in town, from what I heard. Hey, Frank, ask one of the car hops if Mike Hunt's outside. [Woman On P.A.] Telephone call for Mike Hunt. I got her! I got her! [Woman On P.A.] Is Mike Hunt in the parking lot? Is Mike Hunt in the parking lot? Do you know Mike... [Laughing] [Groans] Got her, Tommy. Pee Wee, I'm gonna get you. You little prick... And I mean that literally. [Boys Groan] [Chattering] [Pee Wee] Where you goin', kiddo? [Chuckling] Yeah. Billy, what's wrong with Meat? I thought he didn't drink. Well, he doesn't, but he just found out today he got turned down by Princeton. Princeton sucks! Yeah. Princeton? It sucks! I thought he had scholarship offers from 60 other colleges. Yeah, he does, but for some reason, he had his heart set on Princeton. This chili tastes like shit! [Groaning] Oh, shit. Pee Wee, would you get me some sugar from the end of the counter? That boy been drinkin'? [Retching] No sir, Officer. Our friend is a diabetic. [Tommy] Thank you, Edward, for bringing Anthony some sugar. How many cubes of sugar does your cousin require when he's had too much insulin? [Retching] Two cubes of sugar usually is enough to bring Anthony around. Oh, feel better now, huh? Oh, geez! [Laughing, Hooting] Gee, I've never seen anybody drown in a bowl of chili before. Me neither. I wouldn't even know how to fill out the forms on that. Yeah, you're right. It would be a lot of hassle. I guess we better save him. Yeah, I guess we better. You know, I'm not a doctor, but I could swear this youngster's inebriated. Oh, no, Officer. Not at all. Not at all. Well, now, if you guys say he's a diabetic, okay, but if we find out he's drunk, we're gonna book the whole lot of you as accessories. He's smashed. The son of a bitch does it all the time. Officer, excuse me, but I couldn't help but notice what's been happening. And who are you? Oh, just a bystander. Brian Schwartz is my name. Brian. I don't know if this is important, but I overheard this poor fellow saying that the reason he'd gotten drunk tonight is that his girlfriend had just broken up with him. Now, tell me, gentlemen, wouldn't you be likely to toss down a few if the woman you love turned her back on you? [Snickers] If my wife left me, I'd get drunk for joy. All right. Get him out of here and get him home. Now. Thank you, Officer. Thank you. Will do. [Laughs] Oh. You're one smooth mother, Schwartz. Well, you do what you can. [Tires Screech] [Glass Shatters] [Horn Honks] It's Mickey. Porky's. Oh, Jesus. Here we go again. [Revving] Holy shit! Holy shit. Did you whip him? Hell, yes. I used my face to break the son of a bitch's hand. [Moans] Pee Wee, you better go call Ted. I don't feel so good. I hate to do this, but we better get him to a hospital. All right. I'll get my car. Hospital? Hospital? Mickey. Mickey, where you going? I'm goin' home, you son of a bitch, what do you think? Don't worry, old buddy. I learned my lesson. [Engine Starts] [Tires Squealing] We're gonna have to babysit with him. That won't stop him. [Chattering] Did you see Timmy's face? Yeah, we saw it. Shorts, shirt... You really worked him over, didn't you, Schwartz? Hey, I didn't do that. I hardly touched his face. Just a few little jabs. I couldn't have done that. You didn't do it. Well, what happened? His old man. His father? Why? 'Cause he got into a fight with a Jew, and he lost. Coach, can I talk to you about Cavanaugh? Oh, come on, Lynn. Oh, Brackett. Brackett, you know I don't go all the way. Who said anything about going all the way? We're just gonna go up and have a cup of coffee in the equipment room. No! Come on, Lynn. No, no, no, no. Tell you a little secret. [Whispering] I already know that. Miss Honeywell, do you mind? Do I mind what? It's disgusting. The two of you squirming about like a pair of eels in heat. You're a disgrace. Yeah? Well, it sure beats stomping and waddling around like a frigid hippopotamus, Beulah. What did you call me? Beulah. Beulah "Balbreaker." Who do you think you're talking to? If I heard a hurdy-gurdy playing, I'd think I was talking to the fat lady in the circus, but as it is, I guess I'm talking to a ton of bad news named Beulah, Beulah, Beulah! Look, ladies, I don't...

That seducer and despoiler must be stopped. He's extremely dangerous. And, Mr. Carter, I'm certain that everyone in this room knows who that is. He's a contemptible little pervert who's... Miss Balbricker. Well, I'm sorry, but I've got him now, and I'm not going to let him slip through my fingers again. [Both Laugh] Now, all I'm asking is that you give me five boys for a few minutes. The coaches can be present. Tommy Turner and any four boys you see fit to choose, and we can put a stop to this menace. And it is a menace. [Snickering] Well? What are you gonna do about it? [Laughing] Five young boys in the nude? A police lineup so that you can identify his tallywacker. Please, can we call it a "tallywacker"? "Penis" is so person... [Groans] "Penis" is so personal. We can put hoods over their heads to avoid embarrassment. Now, listen. We have got to do it as distasteful as it is. I know it's him. That tallywacker [Snickering] Had a mole on it, and that mole is the key to it. Miss Balbricker, do you realize the difficulty of your request? I would be very happy to apprehend the young man myself, but can you imagine what the Board of Education would say if you were granted a lineup in order to examine their private par... [Stammering] Their... [Groans] Their private parts for an incriminating mole? [Laughing] But Mr. Carter... Mr. Carter? I think I have a way out of this. We call the police, [Snickers] And we have 'em send over one of their sketch artists. [Both Laughing] And Miss Balbricker can give a description. We can put up wanted posters all over school. "Have you seen this prick? "Report immediately to Beulah Balbricker. "Do not attempt to apprehend this prick "as it is armed and dangerous. "It was last seen hanging out in the girls' locker room "at Angel Beach High School." Uh, M-M-M... [Laughter Continues] There you are. Now let's do it. All right.
