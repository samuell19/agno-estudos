To begin at the beginning... OK. OK. Stand by. Yeah, looking forward or just start looking at the camera? OK. We're up to speed. Nice and quiet, please. OK, stand by, studio. Five, four, three... To begin at the beginning... It is spring. Moonless night in the small town. Starless and bible-black. The cobblestreets silent and the hunched, courters'-and-rabbits' wood limping invisible down to the sloeblack... ...slow, black, crowblack, fishingboat-bobbing sea. The houses are blind as moles, though moles see fine to-night in the snouting, velvet dingles. Or blind as Captain Cat there in the muffled middle by the pump and the town clock. The shops in mourning, the Welfare Hall in widows' weeds. And all the people of the lulled and dumbfound town are sleeping now. (Hush, the babies are sleeping.) The farmers, the fishers, the tradesmen and pensioners, cobbler, schoolteacher, postman and publican, the undertaker and the fancy woman, drunkard, dressmaker, preacher, policeman, the webfoot cocklewomen and the tidy wives. You can hear the dew falling... ...and the hushed town... breathing. Only your eyes are unclosed to see the black and folded town fast, and slow, asleep. And you alone can hear the invisible starfall, the darkest-beforedawn minutely dewgrazed stir of the black, dab-filled sea where the Arethusa, the Curlew and the Skylark, Zanzibar, Rhiannon, the Rover, the Cormorant, and the Star of Wales tilt and ride. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. It is night moving in the streets, the processional salt slow musical wind in Coronation Street and Cockle Row... ...it is the grass growing on Llareggub Hill, dewfall, starfall... ...the sleep of birds in Milk Wood. Look. It is night, dumbly, royally winding through the Coronation cherry trees, going through the graveyard of Bethesda with winds gloved and folded, and dew doffed - tumbling by the Sailors Arms. Time passes. Listen. Time passes. Come closer now. Come closer now. In the slow deep salt and silent black, bandaged night. Only you can see, in the blinded bedrooms, the combs and petticoats over the chairs, the jugs and basins, the glasses of teeth, "Thou Shalt Not" on the wall, and the yellowing dickybird-watching pictures of the dead. Only you can hear and see, behind the eyes of the sleepers, the movements and countries and mazes and colours and dismays and rainbows and tunes and wishes and flight and fall and despairs and big seas of their dreams. From where you are, you can hear their dreams. Captain Cat, the retired blind sea captain, asleep in his bunk in the seashelled, ship-in-bottled, shipshape best cabin of Schooner House dreams of... Never such seas as any that swamped the decks of his SS Kidwelly bellying over the bedclothes and jellyfish-slippery sucking him down salt deep into the Davy dark where the fish come biting out and nibble him down to his wishbone, and the long drowned nuzzle up to him. Remember me, Captain? You're Dancing Williams! I lost my step in Nantucket. Do you see me, Captain? The white bone talking? I'm Tom-Fred the donkeyman. We shared the same girl once... her name was Mrs Probert. Rosie Probert, 33 Duck Lane. Come on up, boys, I'm dead. Hold me, Captain, I'm Jonah Jarvis, come to a bad end, very enjoyable. This skull at your earhole is... Curly Bevan. Tell my auntie it was me who pawned the ormolu clock. Aye, aye, Curly. Tell my missus, no, I never. I never done what she said, I never. Yes, they did. How's it above? Is there rum and lavabread? Bosoms and robins? Concertinas? Ebenezer's bell? Fighting and onions? And sparrows and daisies? Tiddlers in a jamjar? Buttermilk and whippets? Rock-a-bye-baby? Washing on the line? And old girls in the snug? How's the tenors in Dowlais? Who milks the cows in Maesgwyn? When she smiles, is there dimples? What's the smell of parsley? Oh, my dead dears! From where you are, you can hear, in Cockle Row in the spring, moonless night, Miss Price, dressmaker and sweetshop-keeper, dream of... Her lover, tall as the town clock tower, Samsonsyrup-gold-maned, whacking thighed and piping hot, thunderbolt-bass'd and barnacle-breasted, flailing up the cockles with his eyes like blowlamps and scooping low over her lonely, loving hotwaterbottled body. Myfanwy Price! Mr Mog Edwards! I am a draper mad with love. I love you more than all the flannelette and calico, candlewick, dimity, crash and merino, tussore, cretonne, crepon, muslin, poplin, ticking and twill in the whole Cloth Hall of the world. I have come to take you away to my Emporium on the hill, where the change hums on wires. Throw away your little bedsocks and your Welsh wool knitted jacket. I will warm the sheets like an electric toaster. I will lie by your side like the Sunday roast. I will knit you a wallet of forget-me-not blue, for the money to be comfy. I will warm your heart by the fire so you can slip it in under your vest when the shop is closed. Myfanwy, Myfanwy, before the mice gnaw at your bottom drawer will you say... Yes, Mog. Yes, Mog, yes, yes, yes. And all the bells of the tills of the town shall ring for our wedding. Evans the Death, the undertaker laughs high and aloud in his sleep and curls up his toes as he sees, upon waking 50 years ago, snow lie deep on the goosefield behind the sleeping house. And he runs out into the field where his mother is making Welshcakes in the snow and steals a fistful of snowflakes and currants and climbs back to bed to eat them cold and sweet under the warm, white clothes while his mother dances in the snow kitchen crying out for her lost currants. And in the little pink-eyed cottage next to the undertaker's, lie, alone, the 17 snoring gentle stone of Mr Waldo, rabbitcatcher, barber, herbalist, catdoctor, quack, his fat, pink hands, palm up, over the edge of the patchwork quilt, his black boots neat and tidy in the washing basin, his bowler on a nail above the bed, a milk stout and a slice of cold bread pudding under the pillow. And, dripping in the dark, he dreams of... Waldo! Waldo! What'll the neighbours say, what'll the neighbours...? Poor Mrs Waldo. What she puts up with. Never should've married. If she didn't have to. Same as her mother. There's a husband for you. Bad as his father. You know where he ended. Up in the asylum. Crying for his ma. Every Sunday. He hadn't got a leg. And carrying on. With that Mrs Beetie Morris. Up in the quarry. You seen her baby? It's got his nose. Oh, it makes my heart bleed. What he'll do for drink. He sold the pianola. And her sewing machine. Falling in the gutter. Talking to the lamp post. Using language. Singing in the W. Poor Mrs Waldo. Waldo. Waldo! Yes? What'll the neighbours say, what'll the neighbours...? Black as a chimbley. Ringing doorbells. Breaking windows. Making mudpies. Stealing currants. Chalking words. Saw him in the bushes. Playing moochins. Send him to bed without any supper. Give him senapods and lock him in the dark. Off to the reformatory. Off to the reformatory! Learn him with a slipper on his BTM. Now, in her iceberg-white, holily laundered crinoline nightgown, under virtuous polar sheets, in her spruced and scoured dust-defying bedroom in trig and trim Bay View, a house for paying guests, at the top of the town, Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard, widow, twice, of Mr Ogmore, linoleum, retired, and Mr Pritchard, failed bookmaker, who, maddened by besoming, swabbing and scrubbing, the voice of the vacuum-cleaner and the fume of polish, ironically swallowed disinfectant, fidgets in her rinsed sleep, wakes in a dream, and nudges in the ribs dead Mr Ogmore, dead Mr Pritchard, ghostly on either side. Mr Ogmore, Mr Pritchard, it's time to inhale your balsam. Oh, Mrs Ogmore! Oh, Mrs Pritchard! Soon it will be time to get up. Tell me your tasks, in order. I must put my pyjamas in the drawer marked "pyjamas". I must take my cold bath which is good for me. I must wear my flannel band to ward off sciatica. I must dress behind the curtain and put on my apron. I must blow my nose... In the garden, if you please. ...in a piece of tissue-paper which I afterwards burn. I must take my salts which are nature's friend. I must boil the drinking water because of germs. I must make my herb tea which is free from tannin. And have a charcoal biscuit which is good for me. I may smoke one pipe of asthma mixture... In the woodshed, if you please. And dust the parlour and spray the canary. I must put on rubber gloves and search the peke for fleas. I must dust the blinds and then I must raise them. And before you let the sun in, mind it wipes its shoes. Mrs Rose Cottage's eldest, Mae, peels off her pink-and-white skin in a furnace in a tower in a cave in a waterfall in a wood and waits there raw as an onion for Mr Right to leap up the burning tall hollow splashes of leaves like a brilliantined trout. Call me Dolores like they do in the stories. And the Inspectors of Cruelty fly down into Mrs Butcher Beynon's dream to persecute Mr Beynon for selling owl meat, dogs' eyes, manchop. Mr Beynon, in butcher's bloodied apron, springheels down Coronation Street, a finger, not his own, in his mouth. Straight-faced in his cunning sleep he pulls the legs of his dreams and hunting on pigback shoots down the wild giblets. And in Coronation Street, which you alone can see, it is so dark under the chapel in the skies, the Reverend Eli Jenkins, poet, preacher, turns in his deep towards-dawn sleep and dreams of... Eisteddfodau. He intricately rhymes the music of crwth and pibgorn, all night long in his druid's seedy nightie in a beer-tent black with parchs. Mr Pugh, schoolmaster, fathoms asleep, pretends to be sleeping, spies foxy round the droop of his nightcap and... Pssst... ...whistles up. Murder. Mary Ann the Sailors dreams of... ...The Garden of Eden. She comes in her smock-frock and clogs away from the cool scrubbed cobbled kitchen with the Sunday-school pictures on the whitewashed wall and the farmers' almanac hung above the settle and the sides of bacon on the ceiling hooks... ...and goes down the cockleshelled paths of that applepie kitchen garden... ...duckling under the gyppo's clothespegs, catching her apron on the blackcurrant bushes, past beanrows and onion-bed and tomatoes ripening on the wall... ...towards the old man playing the harmonium in the orchard, and sits down on the grass at his side... ...and shells the green peas that grow up through the lap of her frock that brushes the dew. Time passes. Listen. Time passes. An owl flies home past Bethesda, to a chapel in an oak. And the dawn inches up. The principality of the sky lightens now, over our green hill... into spring morning larked and crowed and belling. Stand on this hill. This is Llareggub Hill... ...old as the hills, high, cool, and green. And from this small circle of stones, made not by druids but by Mrs Beynon's Billy, you can see all the town below you sleeping in the first of the dawn. You can hear the love-sick wood pigeons mooning in bed. A dog barks in his sleep, farmyards away. The town ripples like a lake in the waking haze. Who pulls the townhall bellrope but blind Captain Cat? One by one, the sleepers are rung out of sleep this one morning as every morning. And soon you shall see the chimneys' slow upflying snow as Captain Cat, in sailor's cap and seaboots, announces to-day with his loud get-out-of-bed bell. Now, woken at last by the out-of-bed-sleepy-head-Polly-put- the-kettle-on townhall bell, Lily Smalls, Mrs Beynon's treasure, comes downstairs from a dream of royalty who all night long went larking with her full of sauce in the Milk Wood dark, and puts the kettle on the primus in Mrs Beynon's kitchen and looks at herself in Mr Beynon's shaving-glass over the sink and sees... Oh, there's a face! Where you get that hair from? Got it from a old tom cat. Give it back then, love. Oh, there's a perm! Where you get that nose from, Lily? Got it from my father, silly. You've got it on upside down! Oh... there's a conk! Look at your complexion! Oh, no, you look. Needs a bit of make-up. Needs a veil! Oh, there's glamour Where you get that smile, Lil? Never you mind, girl. Nobody loves you. That's what you think. Who is it loves you? Shan't tell. Oh, come on, Lily! Cross your heart, then? Cross my heart. Lily! Yes, Mum? Where's my tea, girl? (Where do you think? In the cat-box?) Coming up, Mum! Mr Pugh, in the schoolhouse opposite, takes up the morning tea to Mrs Pugh, and whispers on the stairs... (Here's your arsenic, dear. (And your weedkiller biscuit. (I've throttled your parakeet. (I've spat in the vases. (I've put cheese in the mouseholes. (Here's your...) Nice tea, dear? Too much sugar. You haven't tasted it yet, dear. Too much milk, then. Give me my glasses. No, not my reading glasses, I want to look out. I want to see. Organ Morgan at his bedroom window playing chords on the sill to the morning fishwife gulls who, heckling over Donkey Street, observe. Me, Dai Bread, hurrying to the bakery, pushing in my shirt-tails, buttoning my waistcoat, ping goes a button. Why can't they sew them? No time for breakfast, nothing FOR breakfast. There's wives for you. Me, Mrs Dai Bread One, capped and shawled and no old corset, nice to be comfy, nice to be nice, clogging on the cobbles to stir up a neighbour. Oh, Mrs Sarah, can you spare a loaf, love? Dai Bread forgot the bread. Me, Mrs Dai Bread Two, gypsied to kill in a silky scarlet petticoat above my knees, dirty pretty knees. See my body through my petticoat brown as a berry, high-heel shoes with one heel missing, tortoiseshell comb in my bright black slinky hair, nothing else at all but a dab of scent, lolling gaudy at the doorway, tell your fortune in the tea-leaves, scowling at the sunshine, lighting up my pipe. Me, Nogood Boyo, up to no good in the wash-house. Me, Miss Price, in my pretty print housecoat, deft at the clothesline, natty as a jenny-wren, then pit-pat back to my egg in its cosy, my crisp toast-fingers, my home-made plum and butterpat. Me, Polly Garter, under the washing line, giving the breast in the garden to my bonny new baby. Nothing grows in our garden, only washing. And babies. And where's their fathers live, my love? Over the hills and far away. You're looking up at me now. I know what you're thinking, you poor little milky creature. You're thinking, you're no better than you should be, Polly, and that's good enough for me. Oh, isn't life a terrible thing, thank God? Now, frying-pans spit, kettles and cats purr in the kitchen. The town smells of seaweed and breakfast all the way down from Bay View, where Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard, in smock and turban, big-besomed to engage the dust, picks at her starchless bread and sips lemon-rind tea... To Bottom Cottage, where Mr Waldo, in bowler and bib, gobbles his bubble-and-squeak and kippers and swigs from the saucebottle. Mary Ann Sailors praises the Lord who made porridge. Mr Pugh... ...remembers ground glass as he juggles his omelette. Mrs Pugh nags the salt-cellar. From Beynon butchers in Coronation Street, the smell of fried liver sidles out with onions on its breath. And listen! In the dark breakfast room behind the shop, Mr and Mrs Beynon, waited upon by their treasure, enjoy, between bites, their every morning hullabaloo, and Mrs Beynon slips the gristly bits under the tasselled tablecloth to her fat cat. She likes the liver, Ben. She ought to do, Bess, it's her brother's. Oh, do you hear that, Lily? Yes, Mum. We're eating pusscat. Yes, Mum. Oh, you cat-butcher! It was doctored, mind. What's that got to do with it? Yesterday we had mole. Oh, Lily! Lily! Monday, otter. Tuesday, shrews. Oh! Go on, Mrs Beynon. He's the biggest liar in town. Don't you dare say that about Mr Beynon. Everybody knows it, Mum. Mr Beynon never tells a lie. Do you, Ben? No, Bess. And now I am going out after the corgis, with my little cleaver. Up the street, in the Sailors' Arms, Sinbad Sailors, grandson of Mary Ann the Sailors, draws a pint in the sunlit bar. The ship's clock in the bar says half past 11. Half past 11 is opening time. The hands of the clock have stayed still at half past 11 for 50 years. It's always opening time in the Sailors' Arms. Here's to me, Sinbad. Nogood Boyo goes out in the dinghy Zanzibar, ships the oars, drifts slowly in the dab-filled bay, and, lying on his back in the unbaled water, among crabs' legs and tangled lines, looks up at the spring sky. I don't know who's up there and I don't care. He turns his head and looks up at Llareggub Hill, and sees, among green lathered trees, the white houses of the strewn away farms, where farmboys whistle, dogs shout, cows low, but all too far away for him, or you, to hear. And in the town, the shops squeak open. Mr Edwards, in butterfly-collar and straw-hat at the doorway of Manchester House, measures, with his eye, the dawdlers by, for striped flannel shirts and shrouds and flowery blouses, and bellows to himself, in the darkness behind his eye. I love Miss Price. And, sitting at the open window of Schooner House, blind Captain Cat hears all the morning of the town. That's Willy Nilly knocking at Bay View. Rat-a-Tat, very soft. The knocker's got a kid glove on. Who's sent a litter to Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard? Careful now, she swabs the front glassy. Every step's like a bar of soap. Mind your size twelveses. That old Bessie would beeswax the lawn to make the birds slip. Morning, Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard. Good morning, postman. Here's a letter for you with stamped and addressed envelope enclosed, all the way from Builth Wells. A gentleman wants to study birds and can he have accommodation for two weeks and a bath, vegetarian. No. You wouldn't even know he was in the house, Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard. He'd be out in the mornings at the bang of dawn with his bag of breadcrumbs and his little telescope. And come home at all hours covered with feathers. I don't want persons in my nice clean rooms breathing all over the chairs. Cross my heart, he won't breathe. And putting their feet on my carpets and sneezing on my china and sleeping in my sheets. He only wants a single bed, Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard. And back she goes to the kitchen, to polish the potatoes. Captain Cat hears Willy Nilly's feet heavy on the distant cobbles. One, two, three, four... five. He's stopping at schoolhouse. Morning, Mrs Pugh. Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard won't have a gentleman in because he'll sleep in her sheets. Give me the parcel. It's for Mr Pugh, Mrs Pugh. Never you mind. What's inside it? A book called Lives Of The Great Poisoners. That's Manchester House. Morning, Mr Edwards. Very small news. Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard won't have birds in the house, and Mr Pugh's... (bought a book now on how to do in Mrs Pugh.) Have you got a letter from HER? Miss Price loves you with all her heart. Smelling of lavender today. She's down to the last of the elderflower wine but the quince jam's bearing up and she's knitting roses on the doilies. Last week she sold three jars of boiled sweets, pound of humbugs, half a box of jellybabies and six coloured photos of Llareggub. Yours for ever. Then 21 Xs. Oh, Willy Nilly, she's a ruby! Here's my letter. Put it into her hands now. Mr Waldo hurrying to the Sailors' Arms. Pint of stout with an egg in it. There's a letter for him. It's another paternity summons, Mr Waldo. All the women are out this morning, in the sun. You can tell it's spring. That's Mrs Dai Bread One, walking up the street like a jelly, every time she shakes it's slap, slap, slap. Who's that? Mrs Butcher Beynon with her pet black cat, it follows her everywhere, meow and all. High heels now, in the morning, too, Mrs Rose-Cottage's eldest, Mae, 17 and never been kissed, ho-ho! Going young and milking under my window to the field with the nanny goats, she reminds me all the way. Can't hear what the girls are gabbing round the pump. Same as ever. Who's having a baby, who blacked whose eye, seen Polly Garter giving her belly an airing, there should be a law, seen Mrs Beynon's new mauve jumper, it's her old grey jumper, dyed, who's dead, who's dying, there's a lovely day, oh, the cost of soapflakes! Somebody's coming. Now the voices round the pump can see somebody coming. Hush, there's a hush? You can tell by the noise of the hush, it's Polly Garter. Hullo, Polly, who's there? Me, love. That's Polly Garter. Hullo, Polly, my love. Can you hear the dumb goose-hiss of the wives as they huddle and peck or flounce at a waddle away? Who cuddled you when? Which of their gandering hubbies moaned in Milk Wood for your naughty mothering arms and body like a wardrobe, love? Scrub the floors of the Welfare Hall for the Mothers' Union Social Dance, you're one mother won't wriggle her roly poly bum or pat her fat little buttery foot in that wedding-ringed holy tonight, though the waltzing breadwinners snatched from the cosy smoke of the Sailors' Arms will grizzle and mope. Too late, cock, too late. For the town's half over with it's morning. The morning's busy as bees. There's the clip-clop of horses on the sunhoneyed cobbles of the humming streets, hammering of horseshoes, gobble quack and cackle, tomtit twitter from the bird-ounced boughs, braying on Donkey Down. Bread is baking, pigs are grunting, chop goes the butcher, milk churns bell, tills ring, sheep cough, dogs shout, saws sing. Oh, the spring whinny and morning moo from the clog dancing farms, the gulls' gab and rabble on the boat bobbing river and sea and the cockles bubbling in the sand, scamper of sanderlings, curlew cry, crow caw, pigeon coo, clock strike, bull bellow, and the ragged gabble of the beargarden school as the women scratch and babble in Mrs Organ Morgan's general shop where everything is sold - custard, buckets, henna, rat-traps, shrimp nets, sugar, stamps, confetti, paraffin, hatchets, whistles. Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard. La di da. Got a man in Builth Wells. And he got a little telescope to look at birds. Willy Nilly said... Remember her first husband? He didn't need a telescope. He looked at them undressing through the keyhole. And he used to shout "Tally-ho". But Mr Ogmore was a proper gentleman. Even though he hanged his collie. Seen Mrs Butcher Beynon? She said Butcher Beynon put dogs in the mincer. Go on! He's puling her leg. Now don't you dare tell her that, there's a dear. Or she'll think he's trying to pull it off and eat it! There's a nasty lot live here when you come to think. Look at that Nogood Boyo now. Too lazy to wipe his snout. And going out fishing every day, and all he ever brought back was a Mrs Samuels. Been in the water a week. And look at Ocky Milkman's wife that nobody's ever seen. He keeps her in the cupboard with the empties! And think of Dai Bread with two wives. One for the daytime, one for the night. Men are brutes on the quiet. And in Willy Nilly the Postman's dark and sizzling damp tea-coated misty pygmy kitchen where the spittingcat kettles throb and hop on the range, Mrs Willy Nilly steams open Mr Mog Edwards' letter to Miss Myfanwy Price and reads it aloud to Willy Nilly by the squint of the Spring sun through the one sealed window running with tears, while the drugged, bedraggled hens at the back door whimper and snivel for the lickerish bog-black tea. Beloved Mafanwy Price, my bride in heaven. I love you until death do us part and then we shall be together for ever and ever. A new parcel of ribbons has come from Carmarthen today, all the colours in the rainbow. I wish I could tie a ribbon in your hair, a white one, but it cannot be. I dreamed last night you were all dripping wet and you sat on my lap as the Reverend Jenkins went down the street. "I see you've got a mermaid in your lap," he said and he lifted his hat. He's a proper Christian. Not like Cherry Owen who said, "You should have thrown her back!" he said. Business is very poorly. Poly Garter bought two garters with roses but she never got stockings so what is the use, I say? Mr Waldo tried to sell me a woman's nightie, outsize, he said he found it and we know where. I sold a packet of pins to Tom the Sailors to pick his teeth. If this goes on I shall be in a workhouse. My heart is in your bosom and yours is in mine. God be with you always Myfanwy Price and keep you lovely for me in His Heavenly Mansion. I must stop now and remain, Your Eternal, Mog Edwards. And then a little message with a rubber stamp, "Shop at Mog's"! Mrs Dai Bread One and Mrs Dai Bread Two are sitting outside their house in Donkey Lane, one darkly one plumply blooming in the quick, dewy sun. Mrs Dai Bread Two is looking into a crystal ball which she holds in the lap of her dirty yellow petticoat, hard against her hard dark thighs. Cross my palm with silver. Out of our housekeeping money. Aah! What do you see, lovey? I see a feather bed. With three pillows on it. And a text above the bed. I can't read what it says, there's great clouds blowing. Ooh, now they've blown away. "God is Love", the text says. That's our bed. And now it's vanished. The sun spinning like a top. Who's this coming out of the sun? It's a hairy little man with big pink lips, he's got a wall eye. It's Dai, it's Dai Bread! Ssh! The feather bed's floating back. The little man's taking his boots off. He's pulling his shirt over his head. He's beating his chest with his fists. He's climbing into bed. Go on, go on. There's two women in bed. He looks at them both, with his head cocked on one side. He's whistling through his teeth. Now he grips his little arms around one of the women. Which one, which one? I can't see any more. There's great clouds blowing again. Ach, the mean old clouds! The morning is all singing. The Reverend Eli Jenkins, busy on his morning calls, stops outside the Welfare Hall to hear Polly Garter as she scrubs the floors for the Mothers' Union Dance to-night. ♪ ..Was Tom ♪ He was strong as a bear and two yards long ♪ I loved a man whose name was Dick ♪ He was big as a barrel and three feet thick ♪ And I loved a man whose name was Harry ♪ Six feet tall and sweet as a cherry ♪ But the one I loved best awake or asleep ♪ Was little Willy Wee and he's six feet deep ♪ Oh, Tom, Dick and Harry were three fine men ♪ And I'll never have such loving again ♪ But little Willy Wee who took me on his knee ♪ Little Willy Wee was the man for me ♪ Now, men from every parish round ♪ Run after me and roll me on the ground ♪ But whenever I love another man back ♪ Johnnie from the Hill or Sailing Jack ♪ I always think as they do what they please ♪ Of Tom, Dick and Harry who were tall as trees ♪ And most I think when I'm by their side ♪ Of little Willy Wee who downed and died. ♪ Praise the Lord! We are a musical nation. In the blind-drawn dark dining-room of schoolhouse, dusty and echoing as a dining-room in a vault, Mr and Mrs Pugh are silent over cold grey cottage pie. Mr Pugh reads, as he forks the shroud meat in, from Lives Of The Great Poisoners. He has bound a plain brown-paper cover round the book. Slyly, between slow mouthfuls, he sidespies up at Mrs Pugh, poisons her with his eye, then goes on reading. He underlines certain passages and smiles in secret. Persons with manners do not read at table. Says Mrs Pugh. She swallows a digestive tablet as big as a horse-pill, washing it down with clouded peasoup water. Some persons were brought up in pigsties. Pigs don't read at table, dear. Bitterly she flicks dust from the broken cruet. It settles on the pie in a thin gnat-rain. Pigs can't read, my dear. I know one who can. Alone in the hissing laboratory of his wishes, Mr Pugh minces among bad vats and jeroboams, tiptoes through spinneys of murdering herbs, agony dancing in his crucibles, and mixes especially for Mrs Pugh a venomous porridge unknown to toxicologists which will scald and viper through her until her ears fall off like figs, her toes grow big and black as balloons, and steam comes screaming out of her navel. You know best, dear. Says Mr Pugh and quick as a flash he ducks her in rat soup. What's that book by your trough, Mr Pugh? It's a theological work, my dear. Lives Of The Great Saints. I saw you talking to a saint this morning. Saint Polly Garter. She was martyred again last night. ♪ But I always think as we tumble into bed ♪ Of little Willy Wee who is dead, dead, dead... ♪ The sunny slow lulling afternoon yawns and moons through the dozy town. The sea lolls, laps and idles in, with fishes sleeping in its lap. The meadows still as Sunday, the shut-eye tasselled bulls, the goat-and-daisy dingles, nap happy and lazy. The dumb duck-ponds snooze. Clouds sag and pillow on Llareggub Hill. Persons with manners... Snaps Mrs cold Pugh... ...do not nod at table. Mr Pugh cringes awake. He puts on a soft-soaping smile, it is sad and grey under his nicotine-eggyellow weeping walrus Victorian moustache worn thick and long in memory of Doctor Crippen. You should wait until you retire to your sty... Says Mrs Pugh, sweet as a razor. His fawning measly quarter-smile freezes. Sly and silent, he foxes into his chemist's den and there, in a hiss and prussic circle of cauldrons and phials brimful with pox and the Black Death, cooks up a fricassee of deadly nightshade, nicotine, hot frog, cyanide and bat-spit for his needling stalactite hag and bednag of a pokerbacked nutcracker wife. I beg your pardon, my dear. He murmurs, with a wheedle. Captain Cat, at his window thrown wide to the sun and the clippered seas he sailed long ago when his eyes were blue and bright, slumbers and voyages, ear-ringed and rolling, "I Love You, Rosie Probert" tattooed on his belly, he brawls with broken bottles in the fug and babble of the dark dock bars, roves with a herd of short and good-time cows in every naughty port and twines and souses with the drowned and blowzy-breasted dead. He weeps as he sleeps and sails, and the tears run down his grog-blossomed nose. One voice of all he remembers most dearly as his dream buckets down. Lazy early Rosie with the flaxen thatch, whom he shared with Tom-Fred the donkeyman and many another seaman, clearly and near to him, speaks from the bedroom of her dust. In that gulf and haven, fleets by the dozen have anchored for the little heaven of the night, but she speaks to Captain napping Cat alone. Mrs Probert... From Duck Lane, Jack. Quack twice and ask for Rosie. ...is the one love of his sea-life that was sardined with women. What seas did you see Tom Cat, Tom Cat In your sailoring days? What sea beasts were In the wavery green When you were my master? I'll tell you the truth. Seas barking like seals Blue seas and green Seas covered with eels And mermen and whales. What seas did you sail Old whaler when On the blubbery waves Between Frisco and Wales You were my bosun? As true as I'm here Dear you Tom Cat's tart You landlubber Rosie You cosy love My easy as easy My true sweetheart Seas green as a bean Seas gliding with swans In the seal-barking moon. What seas were rocking My little deck hand My favourite husband In your seaboots and hunger My duck my whaler My honey my daddy My pretty sugar sailor With my name on your belly When you were a boy Long long ago? I'll tell you no lies. The only sea I saw Was the seesaw sea With you riding on it. Lie down, lie easy. Let me shipwreck in your thighs. Knock twice, Jack At the door of my grave And ask for Rosie. Rosie Probert. Remember her. She is forgetting. The earth which filled her mouth Is vanishing from her. Remember me. I have forgotten you. I am going into the darkness of the darkness for ever. I have forgotten that I was ever born. Now the town is dusk. Each cobble, donkey, goose and gooseberry street Is a thoroughfare of dusk And dusk and ceremonial dust And night's first darkening snow And the sleep of birds Drift under and through the live dusk of this place of love. Llareggub is the capital of dusk. Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard, at the first drop of the dusk-shower, seals all her Sea-View doors, draws the germ-free blinds, sits, erect as a dry dream on a high-backed hygienic chair and wills herself to cold, quick sleep. Mr Ogmore and Mr Pritchard, who all dead day long have been gossiping like ghosts in the woodshed, planning the loveless destruction of their glass widow, reluctantly sigh and sidle into her clean house. You first, Mr Ogmore. After you, Mr Pritchard. No, no, Mr Ogmore. You widowed her first. And in through the keyhole with tears where their eyes once were, they ooze and grumble. Husbands... She says in her sleep. There is acid love in her voice for one of the two shambling phantoms. Mr Ogmore hopes that it is not for him. So does Mr Pritchard. I love you both. Oh, Mrs Ogmore. Oh, Mrs Pritchard. Soon it will be time to go to bed. Tell me your tasks in order. We must take our pyjamas from the drawer marked "pyjamas". And then you must take them off. Down in the dusking town, Mae Rose-Cottage, still lying in clover, listens to the nanny goats chew, draws circles of lipstick round her nipples. I'm fast. I'm a bad lot. God will strike me dead. I'm 17. I'll go to hell... She tells the goats. You just wait. I'll sin till I blow up! She lies deep, waiting for the worst to happen, as the goats champ and sneer. Unmarried girls, alone in their privately bridal bedrooms, powder and curl for the Dance of the World.

Like a cat, he sees in the dark. Through the voyages of his tears he sails to see the dead. Dancing Williams! Still dancing. Jonah Jarvis. Still. Rosie, with God. She has forgotten dying. The dead come out in their Sunday best. Listen to the night breaking. Mr Mog Edwards and Miss Myfanwy Price, happily apart from one another at the top and the sea-end of town, write their everynight letters of love and desire. In the warm White Book of Llareggub, you will find the little maps of the islands of their contentment. Oh, my Mog, I am yours for ever. And she looks around with pleasure at her own neat neverdull room which Mr Mog Edwards will never enter. Come to my arms, Myfanwy. And he hugs his lovely money to his own heart. And Mr Waldo, drunk in the dusky wood, hugs his lovely Polly Garter under the eyes and rattling tongues of the neighbours and the birds, and he does not care. He smacks his live red lips. But it is not his name that Polly Garter whispers as she lies under the oak and loves him back. ♪ But I always think ♪ As we tumble into bed... ♪ Six feet deep, that name sings in the cold earth. ♪ ..of little Willy Wee ♪ Who is dead, dead, dead. ♪ The thin night darkens.
