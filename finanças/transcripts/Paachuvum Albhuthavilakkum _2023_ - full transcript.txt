My baby! You're Mom's sweetheart right? Wake up! Wake up, my dear. You're my sweet son, right? Dear Pachu. It's 6:30 a.m., my dear son! Wake up! [praying] Isn't this enough? - This is enough. - Chetta! Is the number 50 in Hindi 'Pachaas' or 'Pachees'? Tell me quickly! Pachaas. Why? Nothing. I was just confirming. Pachaas is 50. Pachees is something else. That's alright. [in Hindi] Here are 50 tablets, Sir. Doctor gave similar tablets last time. It looked the same. Is it the same one? She had asked me to dissolve it in hot water and have it for one month. - Okay, okay. - Okay, okay? Is that how I should take these too? Just a minute, Sir. - Hey, listen! - One minute, Sir. You haven't got your periods this month yet, right Sreeja? No, Doctor. I haven't got my periods this month. Sorry! What is it, Sujith? Well, the last patient has a doubt in Hindi, Doctor. Am I a Hindi teacher? Well, I couldn't understand it clearly. I'm just getting fluent in Hindi. It would take around 7-8 years. Shall I let him inside? It sounds like a simple doubt. This will be over now. Send him in after that. He's new here. Well, where is Prasanth? Pachu is the boss, right? After bringing this guy from his home town, he has become quite lazy. It'll be quite late by the time he comes. You are here, right? That's his confidence, Doctor. He knows that even if you shift from Bandra, everyone including me will come here, without minding the distance. Frankly, I am comfortable here, Sreeja. Though Pachu owns the franchise, he gives me all the freedom. Moreover, Bandra is full of corporates now, right? Though this is a small franchise, it's peaceful here. Pachu has some special technique that keeps us happy. But when he realises that we like him, we're done for! [Singing a classic Malayalam song] ♪ To graze goats in the shade of the forest ♪ ♪ Shall I join you on this pastoral quest? ♪ ♪ Retreating from ourselves, let us abstain ♪ ♪ And refrain from actions that cause pain ♪ ♪ Retreating... ♪ ♪ To graze goats in the shade of the forest ♪ ♪ Shall I join you on this pastoral quest? ♪ [phone ringing] Hello. When did you wake up today? Actually, I woke up early today, hearing the alarm. But your voice was too soft, Mom. So, that was a flop! Oh! So, it was my fault? - Sorry. - I'm serious. Send a couple of strong versions today. No pampering! Make it harsh... like how you used to wake me up in 12th grade. That would be correct. Buzz off! I'm done with it! I have a doubt whether she made Madhu listen to yesterday's voice message. Both of them were smiling at me. Have you eaten? What did you make? Well, I'll show it to you. - Look! - It looks good. It's a Marathi dish. I saw the recipe on Instagram. Both dad and son are okay in the kitchen anyway. Since I'm not there, he has been cooking different varieties of food. He's making curries with everything from the backyard. He made a dish with the shoots of jackfruit leaves yesterday. Only the roses and orchids are remaining now. That's good, right? I heard. Men entering the kitchen are in trend now. Yeah, right! What about your ticket? Grandma, look at me! Why don't you take a flight, just like your return journey? No, flights are too expensive! A one-way ticket costs almost Rs. 10,000. A normal train is good enough for people like me. Hey Vachu! Say Hi, man! Does the little one cry all the time, Mom? No, she just needs milk at regular intervals. She doesn't bother us at all. I can't wait to return. I can't stand the cold here. Just go around and see America, Mom. If the number of Dr. Alice's patients continue like this for one more year, we can start a franchise over there. Well, Madhu Chettan will also have to agree. Well, it's late. Shall I leave? - Good night. - Okay. - Bye bye, Pachu! - Bye! Wait! Do you apply herbal powder on the little one's head? Madhu Chettan doesn't like that. When I did it, he asked me why there was brick powder on the kid's head! Keep mocking! The whites in America know the true value of Ayurveda. By the way, Mom is checking your matrimony profile all the time. Oh no! Well, I was just checking if there were any good girls, among the ones you rejected initially. By the way, I had already checked all that. Their husbands will have a problem with it. - Go to sleep. Good night. - Bye bye. ♪ May I join you... ♪ Oh no! Enough with it, Chechi! So, we have to add spluttered mustard and red chillies in the end, right? - That's all. Okay then. - Okay. - Namashkar. - Huh? Namashkar. They use this greeting only on Hindi news channels. Don't say it again. Okay? Sorry, Chetta. It's been only a week since I arrived. And you don't look like a Malayali either. Where is Pachu? I have no idea! Here. Get me the medicines on this list. I buy these every month. Whom is it for? Your mother? No, it's for Riyas Sir's... It's for the mother of this building's owner. She is Doctor's regular customer. Get it. One minute, Brother. I'll be right back. Okay, sir. Sujith! Hey, get me 120 Rupees. Hey Peter! I don't have change for the taxi. Get it quickly! Bloody fool! Your name is Sujith, right? - Where are you from? - Eloor. And you? I am from Pachu's home town. That's where Riyas Sir's ancestral home is, right? I was the driver over there. And when Sir's father died 10 years back, I came here along with his mother. So you must be very fluent in Hindi, right? Hindi is just a cakewalk for me now. - Can you do me a favour? - What? Can you tell me if there's any Spoken English class for Hindi... somewhere nearby? I saw something like that somewhere during one of my trips. I'll note it when I see it next time. Okay? - Thank you. - Okay. The last medicine on this list is not in stock. Oh no! That will be a problem. Kanchanar guggulu. What a perfect name for a child! This one will be back in stock only after two days, Peter. Don't worry. I'm going to Kerala tomorrow to renew the franchise license. I'll bring it when I come back. I'll be back quickly. I'm returning by flight. Oh! So, you're travelling on flights now, huh? So, we can't blame Riyas sir for increasing the rent of the shop. Turn around! Why is he sending an email to increase the rent? He can call me, right? I have no clue, Pachu. He is on a different level. Ummachi will be back from Kerala soon. Bring the medicine, okay? Done, done! So, this is a rented shop? Attend the call! Talk in your broken Hindi. This is how you learn, right? - Hello. - Hello. Please bring the medicine for loose motion. Flat A9, Milind Apartment, Damodarji Street. We don't have home delivery, Chetta. If you need the medicine, you need to come in person. Is it? Okay then. Is the Doctor in a bad mood? No, but she hasn't cooled down yet! Hello. Biju, that loser from the pharmacy said that there's no home delivery. You've got the wrong number, Chetta. This is the loser from the pharmacy. Is it? Oops. Sorry, man! Don't laugh. That was supposed to be for you! - Doctor. - What? - Doctor. - Hey! - Greetings! - Is this pharmacy yours or mine? Turn around! It's supposed to be mine. But the prosperity of this place is all because of you, Doctor! Don't butter me up! You were handling all this yourself until this guy came, right? But now, you come and go as you please. Doctor, I've been struggling here for the past three years, right? I have even given massages! Now that things are kinda settled, I need some rest. My mind and body should loosen up, right? Sujith is a smart guy. Aren't you? Yes, I am smart. Patients are waiting. Or else... Well, both of you will have dinner at my home tonight. Aleena and her kid have come. Sujith, inform your hostel that you won't need food tonight. And you needn't inform anyone, right? Will there be beef? Lower your voice! Please come! So, I'll have a light lunch today. I think we should skip lunch! [Singing an old Malayalam song] Please sing 'Pralaya Payodhiyil', Grandpa's dear one. [Singing another really old Malayalam song] Great, dear! - You were awesome. Right? - Of course! But lighter songs would be better for kids, right? Yes. Songs like 'Twinkle twinkle little star'... Such simple songs would be better for kids. Your playlist is very tough, Sir. Where's the poetry in 'Twinkle Twinkle'? Will it come anywhere close to Vayalar's poetry? And, Achaamma is not like other children. She's really smart. Moreover, I've passed on my taste to her. Dear, sing 'Pralaya Payodhiyil' once again. - Let these Uncles hear it. - We heard it already. We heard it. We heard it already. Keep the plates and water ready, Dad. Achaamma, come with me. Look. This is Achaamma's dance performance at her playschool. She is the sixth one from the right. Dinner will be ready by the time you finish watching this. Come, dear. Midway through the dance, she will take centre stage. Oh, wow! - Hey, watch it. - I don't want to. The beef is truly amazing, Doctor! It's giving me extreme nostalgia. Drink some water. Tell that to her. She was always behind my Mom, the original Achaamma. When we visit our home town, she'd always be with my Mom in the kitchen. She knows recipes that even I'm not aware of. It's awfully beautiful to even watch her cooking. 'Awfully beautiful' is a wrong usage. 'Very beautiful'. - Very beautiful. - That's the correct usage. Don't go overboard, Dad. How old are you, Pachu? We both are in the same age group, right? Maybe, one or two years apart. Is it two if you deduct 26 from 34? It's eight, right? So, you're that young? Wow! If you're planning to get married, don't delay it. If you don't have plans, it's chill. No chilling! That's the plan. Hey, you must have met at least 30 prospective brides officially, right? I don't deny that. Initially, there were good girls as well. Back then, he was arrogant. He'd say that the next girl would be even better. What do we say? And now, he has neither this nor that! Shall I serve another Parotta? - Or do you want Appam? - Oh no! This is enough! It's already tight. But why is it like this, only for me? Well, who knows... The girl meant for me must be eating beef and parotta somewhere. No, no. I'm sure she must be flirting over the phone. Achaamma, once they finish their dinner, show them Mohanlal's stance from 'Pulimurugan'. - And after that, Suresh Gopi! - Wow! Smart girl! How about another parotta? That's better. You don't have to go to your hostel tonight. You can stay in my flat. That's okay. I'll catch a local train. Listen to me. I won't be coming to the pharmacy tomorrow. I'll go directly to the railway station. Two cases of Ayurvedic tonic have arrived as a parcel. You can take them in a taxi, in the morning. Okay. Sigh! What was with that girl's singing! Whoa! Have you really met 30 prospective brides officially, Pachu Chetta? Doctor was wrong. Even I felt so. I've met 34 prospective brides. What? Then you could have loved someone, right? Who told you that I haven't loved? My love was so strong! And what happened? What would happen! After her studies, she left for Bangalore. Because of some issues at home, I failed in 3 exams. What issues? Since the kitchen in my house was being renovated, along with some tile work, I couldn't concentrate on my studies. Awww! And what happened after she left for Bangalore? She became very modern, dude! She cut her hair short, whitened her face. And started wearing sleeveless tops. So what? - Huh? - So what? Well, she started wearing extra small shorts inside her room, just like her friends. You also wear shorts when you're at home, right? What was the actual issue? There's a decency and modesty that our Ayurveda demands, right? Especially among ladies! - Is there such a thing? - Of course! And moreover, once she got the freedom, she started roaming around with boys! I got angry and lost it completely. You must have gotten possessive and said something foolish to her... linking her with her male friends. That's how she left you, right? Who told that to you? This is a common case, right? When genuine girls dump someone, there will be a logic behind it. Aren't you coming? Mom was sadder than I was... about what I told you earlier. My mom and her had hit it off really well. You're still thinking about that? She is smart. Very good-looking too. She told me on my face... that her future would be better, if I'm not in it. It's simple, Sujith. Be it a friend, a partner, a lover or whoever it is. You must give them the space they need. Then the rest will be awfully smooth. Not 'awfully' smooth. 'Very' smooth. Yes. 'Very' smooth. - Sujith. - Yes. Check who's at the door. Yes, Madam. [in Hindi] Sir, garbage! He has gone inside for a bath. Sir... Garbage! Garbage! Inside, taking bath. Oh my God! Sir... waste... waste! Please make it fast, Sir. I have to go to three other buildings as well. One minute, Madam. One minute. Pachu Chetta, where have you kept the waste? It's in the kitchen. - The green bucket. - Okay. And hey, she is superb, right? Not bad. [in Hindi] Thank you. [in Hindi] Thank you. I was wondering if should shift here, from the hostel. Close that door and wear a shirt! Why are you taking this suitcase? You can take that bag, right? It will be full when I come back. Rice powder, chilli powder, turmeric powder, covered coconut. I bring all these from home. Since I'm coming by flight this time, I'll bring some mangoes as well. It's mango season there. What should I do with the daily collection at the pharmacy? You note it down correctly and lock it in the doctor's drawer. - Take the money for your expense from it. - I'll do that. Call me if you have any doubt, except for your Hindi. You go, come, no worry, Pachu Chetta. [In broken Hindi] I'll take care of the rest. Call me even if you have doubts in Hindi. - Son... - Yes. My leg... - You have knee pain, right? - Yes. And you want the lower berth? I'll give it. Shall I sit here for now? Okay. Do you remember me? Yes, yes. Then tell me. I don't remember. You had come to meet her, for an alliance. Oh, I see! Why didn't it happen then? Horoscopes wouldn't have matched, right? No, no! She didn't like you. That's why. Sorry. Chetta, come here and laugh. Wait for it. Oh my God! There it is! This is the issue. It keeps honking at its own will. Does it honk even while you're driving? It happens more often while driving. It honks at least once every two minutes, without fail! That too, exactly at the wrong time! But why? - Why? - For what? I'm thinking about the same. Long ago, while I was in Bhilai, my father-in-law used to drive this car. Two years ago, he had a chest pain one fine morning. He drove this car to the hospital, got himself admitted into ICU and died safely. I have a doubt whether he is behind this. Like a parting gift to his son-in-law. In that case, we need to check it out! Has the honking issue been sorted? - No, it hasn't. - It has. Where? He's just getting started. I don't think you recognize him! It's our old Rinto! Rinto, it was you? When I saw the uniform, I thought it would be someone who knows the job. Everyone needs only the company's service centre now, right? High class people don't prefer us any more. Even this Rajettan doesn't like me. Listen! You repair this first. You came to repair the hand-brake and damaged the main break last time. That was just a simple wiring issue, Rajetta! Come. Let's have food. I was waiting to fry the Pappadam once you reach. Everything else is ready! - You've made Sambar, right? - Yes. It's all okay. You're leaving day after tomorrow, right? Yes. I need to go to Ernakulam in the morning to renew the agreement. I just have to reach the airport by 7:00 p.m. So, you're free tomorrow? So, I'm not free tomorrow! Wherever I am in this world, Sunday is for sleeping. It's Dharman's daughter's wedding tomorrow. He came home along with his wife to invite us. Dad!! I'm coming home after a long time without a match-making meeting scheduled. Please leave me alone tomorrow. Hey, they had come even on the previous night of our Ammu's wedding, right? Don't you remember? Dharman's younger son even helped us to serve food. You're going alone for the wedding tomorrow. That's fixed. If you want, we will go to their house tonight, and we'll join them to serve tasty food like that guy did then, after which we'll have food and come back. Well, early in the morning, we could just... Oh God! It's honking more often now? I'll set him straight today! What is this? This is too complicated, Rajetta. The horn is fine. It must be the reaction from something else. The service centre you took it to before me, must have given it some medicines for allergy. Poor thing. Rinto, if you can't do it, just tell me. Don't waste my time! Who said that I can't do it? Get me some water. Okay. There you go! Here you go. Where do I pour it? Not to pour into this! I asked for some drinking water. You should make it clear, right? Hey! Once you drink to your heart's content, you have to reassemble all these parts that you've dismantled. We need to go somewhere in the evening. We needn't reassemble all of this, Rajetta. Just half of them would do! These were in fashion when this car came out. They are not in trend any more. My dear Rinto, just get this car back to how it was before you laid hands on it. I like that honking sound! I'll bear it! Are you honking at midnight? - You want to frighten people? - No! No one did it. The car did it on its own. Sorry, Chechi. By the way, that's a great Saree. Let's go! That was great! That Innova is leaving, Dad. Park there. I'll get down here. - Have you eaten, bro? - I'm with... Come, come! Sit down, bro. Pradeep, this table is full now. Set it up. Where are you, Dad? Where are you? To your left! You're such a glutton! We just got here, right? I got stuck here. Now I'll finish this and come. Okay, okay. This is not done! You're coming only now? Our car had a small issue. We were late to start. Okay. Come on. [Singing an old Malayalam song] Holy Mother of God! It's quite a tough song to sing! - What? - I need to wash my hands. Oh, sorry! Have you eaten, Uncle Vasu? What does this look like? I didn't notice that. You won't! Where is Rajan? Rajan is now... Oh! You mean, my dad! I came here looking for him. He must be there somewhere. Let me check. Okay then. Good night. Do you remember us, son? I must have met her for match-making, right? Rubbish! I'm your mother's friend. Girija Aunty! Don't you remember inviting me for your sister's wedding? I remember, Aunty. When we opened the gate, a Pomeranian came running. - That's the one. - Oh no! Did Chinchu bite you? No, dear. By then, your dad caught her. - How's Uncle? - He is fine. - And the dog? - Both are doing very well. Where is Anitha? Mom is in the US. She went there for my sister's second delivery. - She will be back shortly. - Is that so? Convey my regards when she calls. - Okay, I will. - Your Dad? Dad... has gone to have food. He'll be right back. Uncle is behind that wash area. I saw him when I went to wash my hands. I think he lost something. Lost something? Let me go and check. Okay, Aunty. I'll tell them. Bye. If we drink like this, our hearts will be safe. The alcohol will flow this way. Oh! Scrape over there! The key-chain is of a jumping tiger. Don't find the wrong one. Sir, we weren't called here for this work! You can go home only if you get the key, right? - Yes. - Then join us! What's the matter? There's no problem... First of all, accept an apology from me. - Apology? - Yes. Well, I was having dinner. I had our car's key-chain in this hand. When I felt thirsty, I placed the key-chain on the side of my plate. By the time I drank water, they served chicken on top of the key-chain! - Huh? - Yes. I didn't notice it. Now, the key-chain is somewhere along with all this waste. My friends are searching for it. Will you find it anytime soon, Chetta? Don't get stressed. Just hitch a ride and go home. Are you going to stay here, Dad? Well, we will find it soon, right? Search for it! You lost your key in it, huh? Chetta, I was having dinner. I had our car's key-chain in this hand. Well, I heard the story already. - We will find it now. - You won't find it now! You and your son can come in my car. When they find the key, they will bring the car to your house. - Well, let me... - Just come with me! Hey! Come on. Search for it! Hey Siri! Hi. What can I do for you? Call Lalitha. Calling Lalitha. Hello. Lalitha, I'll come home after dropping Rajan and his son. - Okay, Vasuvetta. - Okay. You managed to learn all this even at this age, Vasuvetta? There's no age to learn all this. It's easy. And I have a craze for phones. I use it only when it's absolutely necessary. WhatsApp is good. I can see Ammu and the kids. Even Anitha calls me on WhatsApp. Not just calls, Rajan. We get so much information and knowledge from WhatsApp! Half of it is bogus, Uncle Vasu. Get lost! What will WhatsApp gain by tricking me? How big is your house and property? Altogether, it would be around 1.5 acres. I've given a part of it to the cement company to build their warehouse. How's your pharmacy doing, Pachu? I'm on track now, Uncle Vasu. I'm planning to start another franchise next year. He wants to start a bigger one. Very good! So, we can consider it. What? Do you know Pradeep, the one who holds a share in my super market? I might recognize him if I see him. There's also a chance that I might not know him. His daughter is a dentist. She is a smart girl. She was there today. I saw her. I don't know if he has seen her. He must have seen her. - Pachu! - Yes. Shall we consider it? If there's no issue in considering, we can go ahead. Smart boy! Let's not do it tomorrow. Let's go to Pradeep's house day after tomorrow. Oh no! He's going back by the evening flight, day after tomorrow. He has some work in the morning as well. Let's go during his next visit. Don't you delay this, Rajan. This alliance will happen! When do you have to reach the airport? - 7:15 p.m. - Isn't it 7:00 p.m.? Well, it's okay even if I reach by 7:15 p.m. So, that's fixed! Pack everything and come to my house by afternoon, day after tomorrow. We can go from there. From there, you can go directly to the airport and fly happily. Sky is the best place to dream! - Done, right? - Yes, it's done. How's the match-making process going? Very well. Pull, pull! Pull it. I always get this push-pull wrong. Okay then. Pradeep has sent the location. So, you don't know the route? That's what this is for, right? - What? - This! Hey Siri! Open WhatsApp. Let's go! Oh! Who is honking? Not me. Siri: You've arrived at your destination. The house is bigger than I imagined it to be, Vasuvetta! They even have a chimney. Calm down, Rajan. I'm sure it's nearby. I need to pee. It's urgent. - Must be due to the stress. - No, it's for real. Do it near that wall, instead of wasting time. Let me call him. Hey Siri! Call Pradeep. Siri: Calling Pradeep. Pradeep, we've arrived. But we're in front of a tile factory. What? We're coming. Okay. Has he started peeing? He will start now. Why? That's their wall. Sheesh! This is the place, son! But the gate is over there. The map only shows till here, because that used to be a famous company. What was its name? Company's name... Sorry, I forgot that. What type of mango tree is this? Huh? That's not a mango tree. It's jackfruit, right? Yes, yes. Which type of jackfruit tree? This is the normal jackfruit tree. Oops! I forgot to switch off the motor. You can enter from that side. Okay? He hasn't been able to find a girl on his own, even at this age. The boy is handsome, right? Yes, he is cute. I had seen him day before yesterday. Are you okay with it? To know if he's 'okay' just by talking for ten minutes, I don't know any magic! Vasu Uncle has a very good opinion about this family. Mom! Yes. I love Koshy. Achu! Koshy is your friend, right? He is a friend. He is a Christian. But mainly, after dad and you, it's him for me! Your Dad had told me this long back! You and your 'Best friend' scam! And you're telling this to me only after they got here? Yesterday when I told him about today's meeting, Koshy panicked and proposed to me, all of a sudden. Actually, that's when even I became sure. Anyway, you tell dad about this today. You must tell him today itself. Dad will understand. Both of you like him, right? Then what's the issue? I don't have any plan to get converted. Don't worry. We will be happy together. So, they came here today for nothing, right? That's fine. Where else will they get your special Karimeen (Pearl spot fish) delicacy? They won't forget this, ever. This was excellent. It's great that you avoided bakery items. That's true! I'm fed up of eating bakery items! The fish is fresh. This is Latha's special recipe. My daughter's friends keep coming here just to eat this. There's one guy named Koshy. Oh, he just drools over this! Right? This is not roasted, right? No, it's steamed. It becomes even softer. There is another preparation using Cumin seeds. I'll tell you some time. Aishwarya's pet name must be 'Aishu', right? No, no. It's 'Achu'. Achu-Pachu, Pachu-Achu! Great match! Careful with the thorn! It's said that death lurks around, when eating Karimeen. If a bone gets stuck in the throat, you're done for! Bone... You want to go again? Control, control! Fish Bone! Bone? Latha, get some bananas! Bananas are not ripe. - Then get some rice! - I gave it to Hitler. Hitler? Who's that? Our dog. Dog? Pachu! Pachu! Hey! Do this! - It's gone, right? - No!! Oh no! Pachu! Dad! Move aside, Dad. You come with me. Come. Sit here. Bakery items would have been better. Open your mouth. Oh no! It's a big born. It's better to go to a hospital. Lalitha had been asking me to do a blood test for the past two weeks. So, I just got that done. What's the update? They said that they have to do an endoscopy. So, they brought him directly here from the casualty. He missed the flight, right? Did they get it, Sister? They are trying. Our senior ENT doctor, Rammohan Sir is the fish bone expert. If you had come before 2:00 p.m., he would have removed it very easily. It got stuck after 2:00 p.m., right? What can we do? The bone has been removed. 7:30 p.m. - Congratulations! - Thank you! We're used to it after hearing it so much, right? It would be good if you gargle with salt water before going to bed. If you have throat pain, I'll bring the suitcase. You take a flight. The ticket is on me. Dad... What did I do? You should be careful while eating fish! Tell me, Sujith. Yes... Hello Pachu Chetta... That Driver Chettan has come here. Driver Chettan's name is Peter. Peter! Driver Chettan's name is Peter. Peter! Peter Chettan has come here. Did you tell him that you'd bring some tablet for Ummachi? Oh no! Tell him that I'll collect it from his flat if he hasn't left yet. He's saying he will collect it from your flat. Hey, I'm still in my home town. I missed my flight yesterday. Oh no! It's nothing. Stop saying 'Oh no' and be confident. I'll bring it when I come. - I won't be late. - Sure, sure. Hey, you don't have to improvise. Just tell him exactly what I told you. Okay. I'll handle that. How are things? Pachu Chettan missed the flight. He'll book one that he won't miss, today itself. And since he bought the medicine day before yesterday itself, I'm not worried. You needn't get stressed either. You could have told this to me earlier, right? Riyas Sir is waiting in the car. How will I know that he's waiting in the car? It's Rs. 7,000 for the evening flight today. And it's Rs. 6,500, tomorrow morning. And there are no train tickets available. Take a flight! You can book using my card. No matter whose card it is, 7000 is still 7000, right? Must be your mom calling to say good night. It's Peter from Bombay. Yes, Peter. Hello? Pachu? One second. I'll pass the phone to Sir. Sir. Hello. Hello? Hello? Peter, Pull the car over. Hello, Prasanth. This is Riyas. Yes, Sir. Peter told me that you missed your flight. Yes, Sir. It's fine. I'll come today or tomorrow itself. The medicine is with me. Ummachi must have arrived, right? Actually, Ummachi has not started yet. - She is still over there. - Oh! That's convenient, Sir. I'll go and give it to her today itself. It's nearby, right? Prasanth, I called you for something else. Ummachi was supposed to come to Mumbai by the morning flight today. But she didn't leave home because of a small issue. What is it, Sir? Any illness? No, no! She's just a little stubborn. She's saying that she'll come only by train. She had come here by train with dad long back. But she hasn't seen the Konkan route that came up later. Ummachi has some health issues. So, these overnight journeys are not so preferable. Yes. That too, alone and for such a long distance. Exactly. That's my concern. Ummachi is used to travelling in flights. She has been travelling alone for almost 10 years now. But train... I'm a bit scared. I came to know that you're in your home town itself, when Peter told me. If it's okay for you, can you come along with Ummachi on the train? Sir, train tickets are not available. I had checked. Don't worry about that. I'll release the tickets using MP quota. You're comfortable with 2 tier AC coach, right Prasanth? - I'm comfortable, Sir. - Perfect! - So, let me plan it. - Okay, Sir. Alright. Nothing else, right? Sir, one more thing. I was planning to talk to you regarding the rent. Didn't you get my email? That increment is correct, Prasanth. If you have any doubt, just check with the nearby shops. You know the demand, right? There are no doubts, Sir. It's okay. Good. Then, that's sorted. By the way, which phone do you use, Prasanth? Asus. Asus? Okay, okay. Listen. Ummachi has an iPhone 10s with her. My brother sent it to her from Dubai. Ummachi only uses phones with a keypad. So, you can take it, Prasanth. Well, the packet has been opened. But it's a fresh piece. I'll tell her. No, Sir. That's not necessary. It's cool, Prasanth. I'll update you as soon as the tickets are okay. Nothing else, right? There's nothing else, Sir. Alright. Thanks a ton! Phone? What is it? Do you know the value of the bone that got stuck yesterday? - How much? - I'll tell you now. Rs. 40,000. What? It was a lucky bone. This is the one, Sarojini. What spray did you say it was? Pepper spray. If you spray it on the face, it'll sting a lot! And burn like hell. If you have this, women can travel anywhere, all alone. But you're not going alone, right? You said a boy is coming with you, right? Let him come. I don't want to fight with Riyas for that now. If you keep that thing away, I can go to the kitchen peacefully, Ummachi. Shall I try it on my face? No, no! It's nothing, girl. If you wash the face properly, that burning sensation will go away. Shouldn't you think again before doing it? I've been thinking about it, from the day I got it. Don't do it, Ummachi! Listen to me. That's my problem. I don't listen to anyone! - Assalamu alaikum. - Walaikum assalam. - I'm a Hindu. - Is it? - Me too! - Is it? I came to travel with Ummachi on the train. Riyas Sir sent me. I'm Prasanth. Peter mentioned some other name when he called. Pachu. That's me. Yes... Pachu. - Who is it? - It's that boy. Come. Ask him to sit down, Sarojini. Get him something to drink. It's okay. Chechi, I don't need anything. I just had lunch. Okay then. Do they still serve Bread Omelette on the train? Yes. We must buy it then, Pachu. Your name is Pachu, right? Yes. Such a nice name to call. Pachu! It's just that I haven't seen you in person. Dr. Alice talks about you all the time. My mother's house is nearby. Half of my ailments go away just when I meet Alice. Mine too. Is it time to leave? There is time. Since it's a special train, it will be running late. You can get ready, Ummachi. You'll have some luggage, right? I just have this. Once I put this on my shoulder, I am ready! While travelling, luggage should always be less. Sarojini, we're leaving. Can you please bring my shoes? While travelling at this age, shoes are the most comfortable. If we don't use shoes and sunglasses thinking what people might say, the loss is ours alone! That's true. True! Shall we leave? I got a great glimpse of the Lord. Yes, it was great. It was crowded. But it was okay. Get in. I'll hold it. Straight, straight. This is the one, Ummachi. 22, 21. - Swami. - Yes. This is our seat. Glory to Lord Ayyappa! Glory to Lord Ayyappa! Which station is this? Chengannur. - That's in Kerala? - Yes. Aren't you a Malayali? Yes, I am. Don't you know Malayalam? Yes, I do. Hey! Which one is your berth, Swami? There. Upper berth. You can lie down here till someone else comes. Oh, okay. When will this train reach Mumbai? - Two... - Ask that in Malayalam now. When will we reach Mumbai? Mumbai is the station where we'll get down. You can get down with us. There's plenty of time left. Are you travelling alone? Yeah. I had come with my elder brother. We went to Sabarimala. On the way back, he went to Munnar with one of his friends from Kochi. Some sudden plan. And he made me board this train. To travel alone at this age, you're a brave boy! What's your name? Ashwin. Laila. Omelette! Bread Omelette! Piping hot bread omelette! Brother! Two bread omelettes! Uncle... One more. Actually, no. Glory to Lord Ayyappa! Poor thing! No. It's okay, Aunty. I don't want it. Eat it and give us company, Swami. Take it. Pachu, have you eaten the Calcutta egg roll? I've heard of it. You should have it from the streets over there. Only then will you get its real taste. I haven't seen Calcutta even on a map! Oops! I hadn't called Riyas! Yes, we've boarded. We just settled down. Yes, Prasanth is here. Okay. These phones with buttons are so convenient, right? IPhones are very tough to use. The touch screen always gets faulty! - How's the toilet? - Excellent! Yikes! Call me if you need to use the bathroom at night, Ummachi. I'll be up here. Wait a moment, Pachu. - Here you go. - It's an iPhone, right? I had told him that I don't need it. Take it. Why would I need it? Let's not waste it then. - Good night, Ummachi. - Good night. Oh my God! Ammachi! I mean, Ummachi! Ammachi! Goa? Hey iPhone! Crap! What happened? Ummachi! - Is there any problem? - Full problem! Bombay! Ummachi! Has this hag gone nuts? What have you done, Ummachi? This is Goa, not Bombay! Chetta! Even he got down? The train will leave now. Are you sleep-walking? The train is leaving, Ummachi. Come, let's go! Can't you hear what I'm saying? Didn't I ask you to call me if you need anything? What will I tell Riyas Sir now? - Chetta. - What? - The train has left! - Oh no! The train has left! The train has left! Can't you hear me, Ummachi? [Pachu's muffled voice] Ummachi, just come with me. Oh no! Ouch! One minute. Why did you get down? You only told me to. Talk in Malayalam! Talk in Malayalam! You told me to get down with you, right? Don't you have common sense? You know how to read, right? Do you see 'Mumbai' written over there? Do you? Chetta, please don't scold him any more. I already gave him an earful. If you scold him again, he won't stop crying. Who is this guy? I am his brother. We went to Sabarimala together. On the way back, I had an emergency. Are you crazy? Does anyone send such a small kid alone on a train? You're saying this because you don't know her, Chetta. She has slit her wrist twice before! So... That's good! You deserve it! Don't go, Chetta. Hey! Go with him, Chotu! Okay. Chetta! Here you go. Try using this to wash. It's cold milk. It helps. That worked. It's better now, right? Well, cold milk is a good solution for pepper spray. It was me who googled it and told him. Why are you coming live at regular intervals? Chetta, I'm sure to be thrashed for leaving him alone. If he comes to know about this, I'm finished! You expect me to make him board the next train safely? - Will it be too much trouble for you? - Yes! Ask him to sneak into some train! Chetta, he doesn't even know what platform to stand on! He is a small child, right? Please! Just make sure that he is not alone. If the next train is late, bus is also fine. I checked. There's a Volvo service from there. Please don't leave him alone. Just make him board the bus. Please. Can't you treat him like a son? I don't want to! - Come. - Thank you, Chetta! Thank you so much! Stop gawking and go with him, you fool! - Come! - Taxi? - Taxi, Sir? - Taxi? Will they kill us? You stay with me! - Where do you want to go? - Did an old lady take a taxi from here? - A lady with a pink bag? - Yes, yes! Pink! Pink! - In whose taxi did she leave? - In Makrand's taxi. - Who's Makrand? - Who knows! Where are you, Makrand? Where in Assagao? Okay. Assagao. 1000 Rupees only. 900 Rupees only! Come on! Hello? Okay, Dad. It's my dad. Don't you ever pass me the phone if your family calls! I haven't called my own dad yet! How much more time, Brother? - 10 minutes more. - Hello? Okay, Dad. I'll call you back. Yes, this is the place. Can you wait for five minutes, brother? For this fare, I can't, Sir. Get going then! You get down. Come, come! Sit here. Chetta, Chetta! Spray. What? Spray! Ummachi, I will go blind! Please don't spray it! Please, please! What do you want? Please be on the line. I'll call you back right away, Sir. What do you want? Hey Swami, come over here. What is it? Chettan's English got stuck. Tell her why we've come here. Okay. We came in search of an old woman. She was travelling with us in a train to Mumbai. But she suddenly got down in Goa. We had to run after her. Yeah! So? Why are you here? She is asking why we've come here. You know that, right? Ask her. It seems she is here. There's no one here. She is saying there's no one here. I understood. Just translate what I tell you. She is not here? Ask her about the shoes! Whose shoes is this? Those are mine. Liar! He says you're a liar. What the heck! I know you're hiding Ummachi inside. Get out of my house! Or I'll call the police. - Hello, Sir. - Hello, Prasanth! Has Ummachi got wheezing? Does she have breathlessness? Is she okay? I'm going breathless now, Sir. It's all a mess out here. Ummachi got down from the train at Goa. When I went to get her back, she attacked me with a pepper spray. Oh my God! We missed the train. I've tracked the taxi she took and reached in front of a house in Goa. She is here itself. I'm sure. Thank God! I'm so sorry, Prasanth. Please make sure that Ummachi doesn't leave that place. I'll come there. The flying time from Mumbai to Goa is just one hour. Just send me your location. I'll start right now. Well, you don't have to come here, Sir. No, no. This is my mistake. I'll deal with it. Look here. Please be there till I reach. Okay? Okay. What happened? 'Please be there till I reach.' Come. What happened? Hello Peter. Okay. I need to go to Goa urgently. The first flight in the morning. You need to come with me. Does Peter know where our Gita's house is? He knows. Peter, you know where our maid's house is, right? Yes, Gita's house. We need to go there first and then, straight to the airport. No. No need to take any bags. Okay. Tell me what happened, Riyas. Ummachi got down at Goa, Saira. The whole damn travel was her plan! Is it done? How much salt have you put in this? Peter? Where is Nidhi? She is in Goa. Where in Goa? With her Grandpa... in Vasco. - Why? - Nothing. I'm leaving. What happened? Peter! Sir, she is in Goa itself. In Vasco... with Gita's father. - Go and get the exact location. - Okay. - Peter. - Sir. Note it in your phone. - We have to navigate to that place. - Okay, Sir. [mouthing] Go! [mouthing] Go on! [mouthing] Knock! [mouthing] Knock harder! Good morning! Could you fill some water in this? Thank you! Can he use the toilet? No. - Arif's brother... Riyas. - Hi. - You have the location, right? - Yes. Okay. We will follow. Sir, are they Arif Sir's local staff from here? They are cops, Peter. Pachu! Pachu! Oh, Peter! This is the house, right? Yes. Did I send you with her to sleep like this? I didn't sleep. Who is this? He tagged along with me from the train. For what? When we got down, he also followed thinking it's Bombay. He too got pepper sprayed. Hello, Uncle. Come. Sir, the calling bell is near that door. You can go, Sir. It's safe. Where is Ummachi? Sir. She doesn't know Malayalam. She speaks English. - Where is Ummachi? - She is not here. She is not here? She's not here? This has been going on for while now! Shall I call the Police? Please. Call them. See! They can hear you right away! The man in the grey shirt is Lokesh Naik, Panjim Sub Inspector. If you're not comfortable with that, there is a lady constable also. Shall I call them? Now tell me. Where is Ummachi? She is not here. If she's not here, how about these shoes... Oh no! That's gone! Look here. She is my mother. She is 71 years old. Her phone is switched off since morning. She isn't healthy enough to endure this stress or travel like this. Please understand my tension, for God's sake! Sir, trust me. Aunty had come here. But she left a while back. Where to? Is it to Vasco? Peter. Come. Come, let's go. They are leaving. So, you were a Malayali, huh? Did I say I'm not? Ashwin. What's your name? - Hamsadhwani. - Good to meet you. Ashwin, let's go dude! Glory to Lord Ayyappa! - Lokesh... Vasco. - Alright, Sir. Enter the address that Gita gave, on the map. Okay, Sir. Sir, what should we do with Pachu and that boy? Send them in a train or a bus, whichever is easier. Okay, Sir. Wait. Don't let them come in this car. Ask those guys to bring them. And you get back here quickly. Pachu! After a while, there's a Volvo bus that goes to Mumbai from here. Take that one and leave. You take rest now. You look tired. Keep this. It's alright, Peter. Let me know when you find Ummachi. Okay. There must be a toilet inside. Stay inside after that. I'll go and buy something to eat. Swami, keep this suitcase inside. Okay. - She is there! - Who? I'll show you. Wait here. Wait right here! Peter! Ashwin! What have you done, Ummachi? Do you know where all we searched for you? I've called Riyas Sir. Let him come. Get in the car, Ummachi! GET IN THE CAR! - Mr. Lokesh! - Yes, sir. Lokesh, we're heading to the airport. Anyway, thanks a lot for your support. Thank you, Sir. Thank you so much! See you! I'm so sorry, Prasanth. Anyway, thank you so much! The bus will take a long time to reach! Come with us on the flight. Come. Come, kiddo! Come! Come! Nana (grandpa)! Hey, this is empty! Shall I fill it up and bring it? Didn't you go? What have I told you? To talk in English. Then, speak to me in English. You did not go? 'Didn't you go?' Didn't you go? No. Brother, can you please drop him at the hospital? Small accident. Please! Yes, bring him. Thank you! Careful, careful! Thank you, Brother. Yeah, it's okay. Shall we leave, Nani (grandma)? Okay. Let's go home first. I need to get something. Gave him a good trashing, right? Him and his drama! Bugger! Hey, what is it? I came to meet Nidhi Didi. Get lost! Hey, Nidhi! How come you're home so early? Tell me! I'm not well. That's why, Grandma. You are fine! Take the drum and go to the hotel with Savio. That's okay, Amma. Dad can come alone to pick me up. No, some other Uncle paid for the ticket. Go and give the food for Ummachi. Yeah, okay. Sure. Have your food and come over there. Bye! Ummachi, sandwich? Have it. I don't want it. Swami, vegetarian for you. Chicken for me! Sorry about the pepper spray. That's okay, Aunty. Tomorrow is Wednesday, right? Yeah. Don't you have school? Yes. Do you like going to school?

Please move aside. Keep it carefully. We should know who gave each one. Okay. Hi, Ummachi! This is my younger sister. The youngest must be around somewhere. Do you all live here together? Yes. Don't you have to apply for 11th grade? My grandma is taking me to Goa during the vacation. Mom told me that she'll put me in the same school only. Where is Nidhi, Gita? In Goa. With her Nana. It's time for her admission. Bring her back quickly. Gita. What's the matter? Aunty, She could study till 10th grade, all thanks to you. She even speaks in English now. But now... What now? Now, she will stay with her Nana... in Goa. What are you saying? She's so good in her studies. You know that! You saw our house, right? I have two more daughters apart from her. And now, I have a husband as well. So? Nidhi is a big girl now, Aunty. She can't stay here any more. And Goa is our home-town. She might feel bad initially. But later on, she will understand... that this is best for her. Hello? Hello, Ummachi. Nidhi! Where are you? Take me with you, Ummachi! I had told Gita, Nidhi. Mom doesn't want me, Ummachi. I want to come back. Please! My classes have started. Ummachi, please! Nidhi. - Hello, Aunty? - Nidhi? Hi, I'm Hamsadhwani. I'm a Malayali. I'm calling from Goa. It was Nidhi's Nani who sent her to my house for work. When I saw that she's really depressed... She really doesn't belong here. I'll come there. I'll take her away from there. Will I get Nidhi on this number? She doesn't have a phone. You can call me, Aunty. I'll text you the address. Ummachi! Please come, Ummachi! If you come, Nani will agree. Please, Ummachi! Don't cry, Nidhi. I will come. Are you really serious, Ummachi? Very much, Riyas. You don't have to come. Just send Peter along with me. She is a smart girl, Ummachi. Agreed. But it's something that her family has decided. It's their personal affair. We don't have the rights to get involved in it. In Nidhi's case, I have the rights, Riyas. You're getting over-emotional with age, Ummachi. You should not compare their lives with ours. Even if they don't have a single penny with them, they can sleep peacefully, Ummachi. IMRAN, COULD YOU PLEASE LOWER THE VOLUME? Ummachi. Just wait and watch. This Nidhi... After a year, she would've forgotten all this, and will be living comfortably, after marrying someone over there. You never know! We're not going to discuss this again. So, you're going to Kerala tomorrow, right? Once you reach there, you'll forget all this and your mind will become free. If that Malayali girl from Goa calls you again, don't answer the call. There is nothing else, right? No. Good. ♪ O' Lotus bloom, O' monsoon's embrace ♪ ♪ O' peacock with rainbow hues, a stunning display of grace ♪ ♪ To swim through the depths of darkness ♪ ♪ To sit with me and ease my distress ♪ ♪ You shone like a star, bright and fearless ♪ ♪ O' Lotus bloom, O' monsoon's embrace ♪ ♪ O' peacock with rainbow hues, a stunning display of grace ♪ ♪ To swim through the depths of darkness ♪ ♪ To sit with me and ease my distress ♪ ♪ You shone like a star, bright and fearless ♪ ♪ To journey through the seas far, without tiring ♪ ♪ To reach out and grasp each dream aspiring ♪ ♪ My beloved, my heart's delight ♪ ♪ In my embrace, forever safe from any plight ♪ ♪ She's the moon-flower's petal, gentle and fair ♪ ♪ A golden flame that illuminates the air ♪ Nidhi!

God... I mean, if God exists, He will make us believe that He is with us. But suddenly He will let go of our hands, and wouldn't turn back while going away, even if we call Him. I landed in front of you, at one such point. It's all over now. Riyas won't let me go anywhere alone hereafter. Yeah, yeah. We're landing at 7:30. He is not such a cruel person. When he was this little, he saw a child of his age, along with a lady who came begging at our house in Calcutta. When he saw that the kid wasn't wearing any clothes, he took off his shirt and gave it to the child. That was Riyas. Look at him now. He's not as large-hearted as that child who gave his shirt away, any more. Some people are like that. As they grow, they become smaller inside. Come here. Can't you help her? Why should I? You help them. I've already done too much help! Don't make eye-contact. The flight will be here now. - Just don't mind her. - Okay. - Pachu. - Yes. Please come here. Huh? Just come here. The building in which your pharmacy is situated? - Yes. - That's mine. Riyas' Dad bought that entire building in my name. Don't take revenge on me, dear Ummachi! I haven't even gotten married yet. Listen to me. Quietly get out from here, call Hamsadhwani, meet Nidhi and bring her to me. If you do that, that shop will be yours! Your own! This is my word! You've got five minutes time. If you're okay with it, I'll send you Hamsadhwani's number. If you're not okay with it... I'm okay with it. Good. Good. You're escaping, right? Yes. But I'll be back. Glory to Lord Ayyappa! Glory to Lord Ayyappa! Keep it in the kitchen and go, help them. Loki, where is Bablu? He has gone to purchase stuff. Show this to the customers and get their orders. Brother, my English is not so... Nidhi! Show this fish to the customers and get their orders. Hello there! This is the fresh catch of the day. Plenty of varieties! What would you like? Your English is perfect! Thank you, Ma'am. Didn't you go to school today? Hello, gorgeous! Go to the kitchen. Lots of order, you know. You know what? Prawns are really good. You wanna try it? Please. Don't break my prawn's heart. Yes, I've reached downstairs. Yeah, just a sec. Okay, Madam. You may go. She's at the second floor. - Second floor? - Yeah. Chetta, this bag... Bhaiyya, can you keep this bag inside? Okay. I'll keep it. Thank you. Hello, Arka designs! I'll send it, sir. I'll send it immediately. Yeah. Okay, sir. Hello. Hi. Good that I called you. Or else, I'd have gone to your house. Just a minute. What was your name again? Prasanth. Aunty said something like 'Pachu' when she called. Yes. People close to me call me that. People who don't know me at all, call me Prasanth. Oh! So, Prasanth it is! Ah, yes. How come you suddenly flipped to Aunty's side? Well, I came to know about everything only now, right? That girl's case. Doesn't that girl have a name? She has a name. What's her name? - Mini, Mini. - Mini? It's not Mini. It's Dhanya. Dhwani, Dhwani! There is something before and after that. Is it Hamsadhwani? Correct! That's great! Hey, that's me! Her name is Nidhi. Nidhi, Nidhi! Nice name. Will you recognize her if you see her? No. Do you have any photos of her on your phone? Not at all. Then on what basis did you come to sit on my head? Nidhi, I can understand that you're stressed. And I've also been stressing you out right from morning itself. You should understand something, Nidhi. I'm going through double the stress! I don't even know who this Hamsadhwani... I got the names wrong again, right? See, I'm done with this. I have hundreds of other problems, apart from this. Personal and over here as well. See! I'm supposed to finish this work today itself. Because of all of you, I reached here only by noon. I might have to sleep here itself tonight. I can understand what you're saying, Hamsa. I too have plenty of problems. I don't have a shop of my own. And I'm not married yet. Anyway, I'll rent a room and spend the night there. I'll freshen up and come tomorrow morning. Then, we will go together... and bring that girl with us. And we'll go to Bombay from there. You will be free then, Hamsa. Hamsadhwani! Prasanth. Call me 'Hamsadhwani' or 'Dhwani'. And listen, Prasanth! Don't drag me into all this. When you go downstairs, there's a shop called 'Malabar Bakery', near the main road, run by a Malayali. He was the one who brought Nidhi when I enquired for a housemaid. You can go ask him. Leave me alone. Okay. Thanks. Just pull it, man! I know! Your bag, Sir. - Bhaiyya, I'll be back in 10 minutes. - Okay, Sir. [Scene from 'Sanmanassullavarkku Samaadhanam'] The Bombay Underworld trembles when they hear the name, Damodarji. Who is he? Chetta! What is it, son? I was sent by the Malayali girl who works at that building. You had arranged a girl child as a maid in her house, right? I've come to take her back to Bombay. There's some issue at her house. Who? Nidhi? Yes! Just show me the house. I'll talk to them and deal with them. I think her grandma is there. I've been assigned to take her back. Do you want to go right away? Can you wait for ten minutes? I'm about to leave. I am going that way. Yes, yes. Please get me a bottle of water. Maneesh! Get a water bottle. It's 11 o'clock. I'll give you one hour. [in Hindi] Just one hour! That time... - Hello. - Prasanth! I got the guy. He said he will drop me at Nidhi's house. There are other Malayalis in Goa, who are willing to help others. Is it? Very good! Hello? Shucks! What kind of a girl is she? What kind, dear? A different kind... Shall we go? My vehicle is on the other side. My luggage is in the watchman's room over there. Let it be there. It's safe, right? - It's safe. - Come, son. What's your name, Chetta? - What, son? - Name! Your name? Ravi. Ravindran. And yours? - Prasanth. - Okay. But you can call me Pachu. Okay, son. This seems quite far, Chetta! It's nearby. We will reach now. You can get down here, Pachu. Hey! Your mom's medicines are in here. I didn't get the rose tablet. So, what do we do for dinner? - We will make mutton, right? - Okay. Let me go there and buy it. Well, this is the guy I told you about. That's my son. Loki. - Lokanathan. - Prasanth. That lady beat up the girl, right? I had asked him not to tell her. Pachu, all of us are close kin of that girl. That's Savio. He is Nidhi's Nani's main man! Almost like her own son. 'Nani' means Grandma. Her actual grandma is dead. This lady is her grandpa's 2nd wife. And she's quite vicious. They are going to beat you up a little now, Pachu. You won't have too many injuries. A basic beating. So, just accept it, go collect your luggage and head straight to Bombay. It's all clear now, right? - Loki! - Yes. Pachu has a very good phone. You can take that. You will give it if he asks for it, right Pachu? If you inform the police, Savio will chop you along with the mutton! Dinesh! Hit him! Good shot! Take his wallet. It's yours. No! Don't take it! There's nothing in it. - Nothing in it! - Pinto! Give him one! Of course! Loki! Take his phone! Hey! Don't take the phone! Don't take the phone! IPhone! Wow, Loki! You hit the jackpot! Give him one. No. Your 'Malayali' love is coming out, huh? - Sankhya! - Bro, bro! Don't do anything, Bro! Listen, loser! Next time you poke your nose into my family matters, you'll be finished! You'll get a bus to Panjim down there. Get lost from here! What happened, Sir? Can I get some water? Come, come. Hello. What? What happened? I can't move this finger. Is there any hospital nearby? Come. Okay, Sir. Keep it for some time. You need to file a complaint with the police tomorrow. Did they take your wallet along with your phone? For the time being, I'll settle the hospital bill. Do you have any cash in your suitcase or bag? Any place to stay tonight? Can you admit him here tonight? He is perfectly fine. He can leave today itself. Yes, Vivek. It's almost done. No. Shreya has gone to Delhi. No, no. It's okay. I can handle this myself. Well, did the movie get over so soon? Oh my God! I really can't do this again, Vivek. What soft corner? He lost his phone and wallet! His age? I don't know all that! Okay, fine! Hey! What's your age? 34, Capricorn. 34. He looks normal. Not very handsome. He's not as handsome as you, Vivek! Don't worry! Just relax. He is not hitting on me! Photo? For what? Either you go back inside and watch the movie, or you go home! Tell me. Will you stop this if I send a photo? Okay. Can I click a photo of yours? Okay. Dhwani, why are you lying to me? This guy... looks quite smart. What do you want, Vivek? Should I leave him here and go? No. Make him stay in your house. Ah! Perfect, Vivek! I was thinking of booking a room for him. But your idea is better. Why should I waste money unnecessarily? Let him sleep in Shreya's room. Now you can stay awake all night, thinking about this! I'm also switching off my phone. Bye! Hey! You can stay in my house tonight! Okay. Aren't you coming? Well, if I stay here tonight, that other guy might... No. You can sleep there then. You're used to that now, right? Hey! Do you stay alone here? No. My friend stays with me. Shreya. Come. You're sure, right? Do you have plans to assault me? No. Were you involved in any theft or murder back home? Sheesh! Come on in then. Was it your husband who called earlier? Is it okay if I tell you tomorrow? Okay. You can sleep in this room. There's a bathroom inside. If you want water, it's in the fridge. - Good night then! - Nice! Whose room is this? Shreya's. What does she do? She is a travel vlogger. She's not here now. Is she married? What all do you want to know, Prasanth? Good night! Had you fallen asleep? No, I didn't. What is it? Can you sleep in my room, Prasanth? Shreya doesn't like anyone else sleeping in this room. She is okay if it's me. Oh! Just a minute. Okay. Good night! Oh no! Hello! What is it, Prasanth? Can you please open it? I forgot something there. What? It's private! Just open the door. I'll take it. Ah! I saw it. You saw it? I'll give it to you. Sheesh! No, no! I'll take it myself! Just open the door. Please open the door. I got a good offer on it. That's why. Oh, that's good. Good night! Good morning! You got ready so early? I didn't get ready. I had to get ready! When I opened the tap, water came gushing from the shower! Since I got wet, I finished my bath. Similar to my current situation! How's your finger? It's better. Good that they plastered it. Breakfast is ready in the kitchen. You can have it. I'll be having it only after this. Let's leave at 8:30 a.m. Okay. You haven't made Dosa, huh? I saw that the batter is ready. That's a smoothie! Well, it's a mix of fruits, milk and oats. If you drink one glass, it's more effective than Dosas and Idlis. Oh! Do you have coffee powder? No. We don't have tea or coffee here. - Is green tea okay? - Oh no! I'll eat that. I mean, drink that! This one's engine is solid. It doesn't even look like a second hand boat, right? No? This one is good too. It will be profitable for us. We've fixed this one, Nani. - It's good. - Right? Yes. You've become a boss now! Isn't it? What, Nani? Whatever is mine, consider it yours! Savio! Drop her to that apartment. Come, Nidhi. Come. Come. First, you must file a complaint and note down that number. When the police ask you questions, be bold with your answers. If they summon that bakery guy, he will act all innocent. Be careful about that as well. Actually, I'd feel more confident if you come with me, Hamsa. Hamsadhwani! Well, I'm not going to enter the police station. Where in Kerala are you from? I was born and brought up in Bangalore. Oh! And the other guy? The one who called? Who? Vivek? He is my boyfriend. Kinda... on and off. I could see that! Didn't he call in the morning? I don't know. I'll know when I switch on the phone. There's going to be a lot of drama. That's for sure! Vivek is unpredictable. But he is a genuine guy. You're not married, right? Nope! Well, you don't look like you're unmarried! Oh, thanks! Prasanth! Let your luggage be in the car. Well, they have threatened to kill me if I go to the police. That's a regular line used by villains, right? Don't worry. Another thing... Come to the office if you get done early. We can have lunch together. Or if you get late... Can you make it a round figure of 500 Rupees? Morning's dosa batter didn't fill me up! Thank you, Hamsa... Dhwani! Where can I get the bus to Vasco, Brother? That side. There? Okay. The phone is locked. I'll take it to Panjim and check. It's alright. Give it back. - Leave me! - Don't scream! If you scream, I'll break your finger! Where's my phone and wallet? You're a good boy. You're not like your dad and his friends. Even when all of them hit me, you didn't, right? - Aren't you a good boy? - Yes. - Aren't you? - Yes, yes! We are from Kochi. My mother is a Konkani from Kochi. She is not well now. Completely bedridden. She is the one who named me Lokanathan. Dad came to Goa for taking care of my uncle's shop. Later, dad took over that shop... through a wrong route! Long back when cops beat Savio to pulp, he escaped from their hands and sought refuge with Nana. Nana was the don over here. Everyone is scared of him. How do you know Nidhi? I've known her since childhood. They used to bring her here for every vacation. And she talks to me and my mother in Malayalam. I knew that she wouldn't be going back this time. Do you know how many houses she works at? Even my dad gets commission out of it. - Lokanathan! - Yes. There's a kind of body massage called 'Uzhichil' in Ayurveda. They make you lie down in an oil tub, massage you with their feet and reduce you to a pulp. And with that, you'd think your body is finished. But after three days, it shows its real effect. It's like a super power. In this case, my massage period is over! Now you wait and watch. I will go back from here, only with her. You're quite fond of comedy, huh? Sheesh! That's all you are? Sit down. Sit down, Chetta. Maneesh! 1 kg almond, nuts, cashew, pista and dates. Give 1 kg each of all these. How much is it, Chetta? Rs. 3,500. Rs. 3,500. That's not enough! Maneesh, get me another one kilo of almond. How much is it now, Chetta? Rs. 4,200. It's almost tallied now. I had more than 4000 Rupees in my wallet. It's all gone. Forget that! - Do you accept cards? - Yes. Then, swipe your own card. Give that cover to me. Hello, Sir. - Is Madam here? - Yes. How's your hand now? - It's fine. - Okay. Take this, brother. This is way too much! - You've got kids at home, right? - Yes. Give it to them. - It's very good for health. It's great! - Thank you! Hi! Doesn't this company have a branch in Bangalore? Yes. But it's better that I stay here. I'll come back later. Hi, I'm Vivek. - Prasanth. - You came to meet Dhwani, right? - Yes. - Then why are you loitering over there? Is it because I'm here? Come, come in. Come, sit. This is the guy I was talking about, Mom. - He is smart, right? - Hello. Vivek, please don't create a scene. What scene? I'm cool, right? You were the one miming at him, right? Please shut up! You didn't believe me, right? She let him sleep in her house the same day she met him. See? He is back to try again! Dhwani explained that situation to you, right? Well, I came to have lunch. Will your food digest only if you eat with her? Vivek, Prasanth has lost his phone and wallet. He needs help. Oh, I'll help then. Lunch is the issue now, right? Come. Let's have lunch together. What say? Didn't we have lunch already? Why can't we have it again? Let's see what reason he'll come up with, after that. Come, come. Come. Get up. I'll deal with this. Come. Hi, Sir. Hi, Ma'am. Ready to order? Shall I order your regular pasta for you? Mom, you can try the Goan fish Thali. - I'll also order the same. - Okay - One spaghetti pasta. Chicken. - All right. Two Goan fish thalis. - Is that it? - That's all here. Alright. Thank you. Mr. Ayurvedam! Order whatever you want! It's my treat. Yes, Sir. - One orange juice. - Okay. - One grilled fish. - Alright. Marinated chicken stripes. - Chicken strips, Sir? - Yeah. Grilled prawns. - Grilled prawns. Is that all, Sir? - Yes. Listen, dear. The two of you were so happy in Bangalore, right? As the perfect couple! I'm not taking Vivek's side here. But if you let go of your ego and be more open with him, this issue can easily be solved, right? I can understand your personal loss, Dhwani. It's quite sad. Really tragic! But we should accept the reality now, right? Even your parents have moved on. You're the only one who's hanging around here hoping for... And ever since you came to Goa, you've become a different person. Vivek has got a great job offer from New Zealand. If you stay away for a while, your situation will also become better. It's such a beautiful country. I had spoken to your mother. Even they're saying that we should register the marriage. And with that, you can apply for your Visa too. An engagement in Bangalore. Just for a guarantee. The wedding can happen whenever you want it, right? Sir, your chicken strips. Enjoy! So sorry! Sorry, sorry! I will just get your order. I had ordered this. Shall I take it? Dhwani, do you think I'll make a bad partner? And you know that I love you the most. Don't you? Ma'am, grilled fish. That's mine, you mad-hatter! Grilled fish. I had ordered it. Oh! At least, get us some water! Tell me, dear. Shall I proceed? I don't know how to make you understand this, Aunty. I know you all love me. But, I need to think about it. Is it rocket science to think so much about it? Yes or no? And you know what to say! I know what you are going to say. Isn't that why I took a flight here as soon as he called me? Listen... Please don't make him go down on his knees to propose. Why not? Will you marry me, my cupcake? Grilled prawns. I had ordered this one too. But it's alright. You can eat it, Aunty. Please come. Come. Just hold on. I've only known you for two days. I don't know about the issue they mentioned, or for how long you guys have been in love. I don't even know why I'm talking to you so freely. But this guy... You don't need him! That's all. I'm not thrashing his mother and him, only because I'm already in a lot of trouble. It's a guarantee if you register, it seems! Crap! What are you? A fridge? Fish thali. Listen... Though it wasn't this bad, I was quite toxic myself. When the girl I loved said 'No' to my face, I mended my ways. In the same way, give him a proper 'No' and reform him! Please! Vivek! It's a 'No'! What? Make it loud and clear! It's a 'No'! - Talk to her, Mom. - Get lost! Get up! I quit! You suffer! - What about the bill? - I'll pay that. Also, you need not be this free with me. Okay. Done. Mr. Ayurvedam! - Thanks! - Nice! It's me, Dad. Yeah, right! My dear 'Mr. Me'! Where have you been? Why haven't you been answering my calls? I lost my phone. I told you from the airport, right? I have some work. That's what I'm asking. The one who boarded a train to Mumbai... calls me from Goa airport! Mom had the choicest of curses for you and for me too, for no fault of mine. I'll reach Bombay in two days. You handle mom somehow until then, Dad. I'll take care of that. Where are you staying? I'm staying here at... I'm staying with a friend. Friend? Which friend? You might not know this friend, Dad. What were you doing there? I'm collecting all the dried clothes. Sigh! All alone? No! There are around 10-15 people, including me. What all are you asking? Okay. You should call your mom today itself. Also, you should call me daily from now on. - Okay? - Okay, okay. Got it! He is fluttering. Is there any problem? If you want to call someone else... I have to call Mom. But Mom will be in the U.S. time zone. I'll call her at night. Then, the Doctor and the assistant at the pharmacy. I'll call them later. You need a phone for that, right? Yes, I need it. You can give it when I need it, Dhwani. Okay. Was it the inspector who said that they'd need 2 days for the investigation? Yes, yes. It was he who said so. Did they summon that bakery guy? They will summon the bakery guy whenever it's convenient for them. Well, don't you have to be with them when they go to Vasco? Yes, of course! I should be there. But they have a jeep, right? So, they can go comfortably. At what time should you be at the police station tomorrow? I just have to be there when the station opens. Huh? The police station is always open, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes! I mean, when the inspector arrives. Today's timing was correct. You're the most genuine person among all the people I've seen so far, Prasanth. How can you be so frank? How come you felt like saying so, all of a sudden? I had actually gone to the police station. Not that! When Vivek proposed today, if you weren't around, I would have said 'Yes'. Oh, yes! That one. Whenever I get really angry or sad, whatever I do will turn out to be correct. That's why I took that liberty with you today. I get it. You know what I'm feeling right now? When you open the door of a room that was closed for a long time, there's a feeling that you get, right? It's exactly that! But you needed me to kick that door open! Which phone is that? It's my old phone. Take it. You can use it till you go back. I have inserted my old SIM as well. Oh, that's very helpful. You can sleep in your room, Dhwani. I'll sleep on the sofa. Is it? Sure! The clothesline to dry all that... It's outside. You haven't forgotten anything inside, right? Go and see for yourself! I too have a soft-spot for old Hindi film songs. It's not a film song. It's an old Pakistani ghazal. I just played it when I found it in this phone. Wi-Fi is connected. I've changed the lock too. Oh, thank you. Since I had a heavy lunch, I'm not hungry. If you are hungry, there are fruits in the kitchen. My stomach is also full, cupcake! I saw that! - Good night! - Good night! Where did you take it from? - From there. - Keep it back there! Yes, Pachu Chetta. Where the hell are you? Lower your voice! I'm in Goa. I got stuck here. I saw a lot of missed calls from Doctor. - Will it be a problem if I call back? - No. You'll hear some sour cuss words! That's all! Me? What's happening there? It's nothing. Day before yesterday, a thief broke in here and stole our TV and set-top box. Luckily, they caught him today. No need to be afraid now. I'm here, right? Did you see the thief? What am I? Blind? Hey Brother! Saw him? Good that he was caught. Or else, everyone would have suspected me! Don't get stressed. The pharmacy is doing very well. Okay then. Don't tell Doctor. I'll call her. Okay. Bye! Hi! What are you up to? I... was just watching the news. I could hear the news headlines on this, inside. When I saw a good photo, I just checked it out. - Then came a video... - Prasanth. Get some sleep. Should I come with you today? No, no! It will be very crowded there. I'll call you if there's anything. I have a phone now, right? Where is it? Ah, yes! Okay then. Hello. Hello. Where are you? I'm on this boat. - Where are you? - I'm at the pier. - I can see the Jankar. - Okay. Has Nidhi arrived? No, Chetta. She will take some more time. Okay. You wait over there. [in Hindi] Are there no bridges over here? [in Malayalam] Yes. But this is easier. No wonder! Chetta! I think she's on the same Jankar. Don't let her see you. Lie low. Come near her only when I tell you. Okay. Why did you trust this guy, Loki? He was the one who got Ummachi caught. Dog! Scoundrel! Wretch! Me? Sheesh! What is this? Hey girl! If you swear at me in your bad Malayalam... You must have taught her all this, right? Long ago! I knew it! I told you, right? Ummachi told me about you only after everything was over. That old hag could've told me this same story on the train, right? But aren't you on Riyas Sir's side? 'You' again! Dear... It's not 'you'. Call me 'Chetta'. I have changed sides now! I'm on Ummachi's side. That means, we are on the same side. Nidhi, what other option do you have? Tell me. This Sunday, Savio is going to check the boat. During that gap, you should go with this Chettan. If Savio is around, it will be risky. It's risky indeed! One minute. If you don't trust me... Ummachi. I'll hand the phone over to someone. Ummachi! Nidhi! Don't make me cry as well. Tell me something. This guy... This guy called you an old hag! Oh, you're right on time! My car is over there. Shall we go? Okay. - This is your regular spot, huh? - Yes. What happened at the police station today? At the police station, it was just the regular stuff. The cops were busy with some other case. I roamed around for some time, like you asked me to. Okay. By the time I had lunch today, it was 4:00 p.m. But yeah, one of my projects got approved. - So, that's a relief. - Oh! As a Colour Consultant, you just have to take care of the colours? No. We have to design as well. We speak to the clients and set a theme. They should fall for the colours that we have chosen! Oh! That's cool! So, when you talk to people, how will you identify their favourite colour? That's my skill! What's my favourite colour then? Blue. That's because I'm wearing blue, right? Not because of that. This is another trick. It might not work all the time. But it is possible that a person suddenly likes a colour that they completely hated before. For example, don't you like yellow now, Prasanth? Yellow... Yes. That's it! Is a connection forming between us? Is it? Why do you say so? Well, when you said that the police procedures are getting delayed, I don't know why... I felt happy! In that case, I can delay it even further. Yeah, right! I like your company. That's all. Are you a single child, Dhwani? Well, I just asked, seeing your smartness. No. I have a brother. Younger or elder? He is younger than me. But he will only address me as 'Hey you, Chechi'! What does he do? He finished college last year. Here, in Goa. Birla Institute. So, he must be having a plum job. Actually, his main job now is to keep me seated here. I didn't get you. Last December, he went missing from here. From where? This place, exactly. We found his phone from there. And from this side, his bike. It was not a suicide. Okay? Till evening, he was texting me... that the size of the shoes I ordered for him was wrong. After that, there was no news. And at night, the cops called us. What had happened? They said that he drowned in the sea. They investigated for a month. After that, my dad and I searched for two more months. Searched means we went through everything, including all the dead bodies of his age group, found in Goa. After a while, dad and mom went back to Bangalore. I had applied for a job here, casually. And I got it. That was a huge issue for Vivek. But I didn't care. During such situations, our priorities will change completely. Dad and mom are working in Bangalore. And our flat over there was locked. If they're here, they would be crying daily. So, I asked them to leave. I realized... They were certain... that Appu was dead. We call him Appu at home. His name is Ankit. Dhwani, you don't look like... Someone who's in so much sorrow, right? Prasanth, our main sorrows... I mean... When a loved one is no more, there is a kind of sorrow that engulfs us. After around 6 months, it becomes a part of you. We will get used to it. Then, there's no need to cry every day. We can crack jokes. We can laugh. We can go out with our friends. We can enjoy good food. Even... fall in love with someone! That sorrow will stay within us, without ever troubling us. But it won't go away! It will go, only if we let go, right? I won't let go of it! That sorrow... is my Appu, right? Maybe everyone else is right. Poor fellow. He must be dead. But... even if there's a 1% chance he'll return, I'd be the first person he would call. And... I want to be here... to pick that call. ♪ As the rain fades into memory ♪ ♪ As stories unfold within each drop, you see ♪ ♪ Beyond the horizon, our eyes roam ♪ ♪ Seeking shores in the vast unknown ♪ ♪ The river of tears that your soul cries ♪ ♪ Someone seeks it, a sea with highs and lows to rise ♪ ♪ I will be here with you ♪ ♪ I will be here with you ♪ ♪ I will be here with you ♪ ♪ I will be here with you ♪ It's for you.

That's me. Ummachi! Did you tell Prasanth that you'll write our shop in his name, if he brings back Gita's daughter? Is that why he wasted my flight fare and fled from the airport? Useless fellow! Raisu, come. Come and sit with Ummachi. Apart from our buildings, houses, land and assets, and apart from Arif's share, how much money would be there as savings, in the names of just you, Saira and your son? 20 Crores? I really want to know. It's much more than 20, right? Listen... I have all kinds of diseases! But you've been affected by a much bigger disease now. The disease of making money all the time! Why do you want to lose your happiness, running behind this? You know how important Nidhi is to me, right? When your father died, when my life was just confined to random days and nights, I got hope to move ahead, only after she came into my life. There will be a day when everyone will be proud of her, including you. That girl is really that talented, Raisu. If we can help that girl get the beautiful future she deserves... Just imagine that happiness for a moment. And this shop will seem so much smaller compared to that. Now, I will say something to the two of you. I'm going to my home-town. To his father's home, our home. Pachu will be bringing Nidhi there. Ummachi, Please! Don't do this to me. You can give the shop to him. Because of this, please don't leave me and go! Please! Please, Ummachi! My heart is always with you, right? Saira keeps saying that... you don't get sleep here, when I go back to our home-town. The chest-pain your father had back in our home-town... If that had happened over here, he wouldn't have died. That's what you always say, right? You keep me close because you don't want that to happen to me, right? Isn't that love is enough for me? Listen! I might lead a healthy life in this flat for a maximum of 10 years. But if I am in our home-town, I would've reached your father in half that time! But I will be happy then! I want to walk through that backyard. I want to make fish curry... with the curry leaves and Malabar tamarind from our fields. I want to drive Sarojini crazy! There's an excellent theatre in our home-town. I want to take Nidhi for movies there. I want to board the flight wearing stylish shades... and come visit you all, once in a while. Can't say... Maybe your father will have to wait up there until I'm 100 years old! Ummachi will do all this, only if you agree to it. No more trickery, hereafter. You are my dear Raisu, right? Blues and browns for the hall. What do you think? No. I think they want to stick with muted shades. I need a help. Excuse me. Shall we come back later? I'm going. I'll leave now. Book two tickets for tonight's train. Second AC. Nidhi? - How will she...? - I'll tell you when I'm back. I need your car, Dhwani. I'll come home with her at night. And from there to our home town! Ummachi is over there. And yeah, tickets will be on the waiting list. Don't mind it. Riyas Sir will get them confirmed. Thank you. All okay, right? I'm going to pay the advance for the boat. Handle the shop until I come back. Okay, brother. Nidhi! Throw this in the garbage bin. Shall we go? I forgot to take the house keys from you in the hurry. Here she is! The train tickets have been confirmed. It's at 10:30 p.m. We have to start a bit early. We have the full support of Riyas Sir now. He said he will send flight tickets! But she doesn't have an ID. In trains, it's enough if one person has it. Come. - Give the gruel to Mom. - Okay. What happened, Savio? Where is Loki? Sorry, Nidhi. When the cops came that day, I got really confused. It's okay, Didi. Dhwani... your phone. I don't need it any more, right? Prasanth! Why didn't you tell me earlier that you're leaving today? This plan came up suddenly, Dhwani. Also, And... Anyway, let me reach home first. And then? Ummachi is over there. After I hand Nidhi over to her, I'll be free! After that? Then straight to Mumbai. It's been a while, right? Let me go and pack all this. Stop, Savio! Savio! Oh my God! Brother! Keep walking, you idiot! I had dinner. Let's leave. Or else Dhwani will have to drive back alone, late at night. Five days in Goa! Wow! Phew! It's all for you! It's not for me! It's for yourself, right? I've asked you earlier to address me with respect! Ummachi told me... that you will get the shop if you take me to her. She is just blabbering! Which phone is that? Take that phone out, Prasanth. You were going to the police station daily to enquire about this, right? Your wallet will also be with you, right? Yes or no? Yes. Did you save her so that you'll get the shop for yourself? Is that why you showed affection towards me? Please believe me, Dhwani. Let me explain. What should I believe? Out of all that you said, what should I believe? Nidhi! You saw them, right? I had to beg Savio to stay in the car. If he steps out, he will kill you! Where is that girl? She is inside. Nidhi! Come! Tonight, I will teach you a lesson... that you'll never forget for the rest of your life! - Come! - What are you doing? Move away! Savio, crack his head open! Blood! Blood! My dear Pachu! Go inside! Savio... Come, Savio. Come! Go back inside! You saw that, right? Everything's okay now! I'm leaving. I have a train to catch. Why did you lie to me? Because I like you! To spend more time with you, even if it's for a day! I got trapped with a single lie. I wanted to tell you the whole truth. I wasn't able to. Now there's nothing left to say! When Ummachi came, it was as if I got a magic lamp! A free return ticket, iPhone, shop... and... and you! Even if you believe or not... while I was waiting for you on these stairs with Nidhi today, I had made up my mind that I don't want that shop. I have no reasons for it. That just felt right for me. Listen to this as well. I won't be able to tell you this, if I don't see you again. Your brother, Appu... He is dead! Understood? He is no longer in this world. Your wait is meaningless! You know that as well, Dhwani! At least now, stop this endless wait... and live for yourself! And your Appu will be the happiest to see that! I'm leaving. Come on, Didi! Let's go! Where? Just come! Hey! He had asked me to come here. Where did he go? Stop, stop! Hold this. What are you doing here? You wretched… I'm going to kill you today! You...! You are done for, loser! Shut up! Run, run! It's around 1200cc. But... Hello. Dinesh! Tell me, Savio! What? Who? Come! Come on! Come! Come! Come! Catch them, catch them! Catch them! I'll chop you up! - Come, come! - Go, catch them! Catch them! What are you doing, Nidhi? Kill him! I want to go! I want to study... I will go! I will study! Let's go. Come. Is this tooth still here, dear? Our driver has arrived. Will you drop us at the station, this time for real? - Mom. - Yes. Hello. Ummachi, they are here. Mom was going way overboard. She wanted to see Nidhi immediately. She would have jumped from the flight! Hey, stop it! Sorry. My flight got delayed. That's okay. 11th and 12 grade classes are not over yet. It will go on till 5:00 p.m. So, we'll come after 5:00 p.m.? You can come home. When her classes are over, Peter will bring her home. - Is that fine, Pachu? - I'm okay with anything. Mom was in a hurry. We came so far, right? Can I see her from outside? Come! Pachu. Did you tell Ummachi that you don't want the shop? Yes. Is he mad? Do you know its worth? There are many other things that are worth much more than that, Peter. Right, Dad? It's true! [Class in progress] She is the first one on the second bench. Shall I call her outside? It's alright. Let her study! I miss you, Prasanth! I miss you, Pachu! I miss you, Pachu! ♪ I will be here with you ♪ ♪ I will be here with you ♪
