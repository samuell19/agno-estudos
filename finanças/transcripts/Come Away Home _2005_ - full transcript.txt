We've got the whole summer to do whatever we want. - We're going to have such a blast. - I know. Shopping, staying up late, going to tons of parties. - Oh yeah. - Oh my dad said he could get us tickets for lilics June 20th. - Yes! - This is going to be the coolest summer ever. Jason, where aren't you psyched? - I'm on lockdown the summer. My dad's so pizzled 'cause he got to dizzle this cortizzle. - Like dude, translate. I mean, what the heck is that supposed to mean? - Yo, you ain't down with the street lingo? - Yo, you're not from the street. I mean your dad's a dentist. - I totally know what you mean though. My mom's still all bent up over Doug's party last week. They're like always on your case. - I know. I don't know why don't trust me. - Oh, are we still gonna sneak that party at your house? - Yeah, just keep that quiet. - Totally. Can't wait. Bye Jason. Hey mom. Hey dad. What's up? - Your daddy bought me an anniversary present, and it includes you! - South Carolina? - Shut up. - There goes your chance to get Jason to like you. - I don't care. - The funnest part of summer is the beginning. - I don't want to hear it, all right? - Honey. That's four suitcases. - Don't tell me how to pack. - [Holly] If your parents wanna get away why not just go to the Hamptons or something? - My grandpa lives down there. They want me to see him before he gets so old he doesn't remember me anymore. He lives in the middle of freaking nowhere. - What are you going to do the whole time? - I don't know. I don't know why they would ever think that I actually want to go. - Just ditch, run away. - Yeah right. Not enough time. How much is it for a bus ticket from Hilton head to here? - Beats me. - Holly, you've got to get your parents to let you come down there. At least for a week or something. - No way. I'm staying here. - [Father] Annie. Get packed. - Better go. It's off to the island of boring. - Bye. (Slow music) - [Mother] Annie, are you packing? - [Annie] I'm working on it. - [Mother] Honey, our flight leaves first thing in the morning. - [Pilot] Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Hilton head island. Have a wonderful vacation, and thank you for flying with us. - [Father] Carol, you've called him five times. Will you relax? - [Mother] I am relaxed. He's not picking up. I just hope he remembers we're coming today. - [Father] Hey Annie, your grandpa's got a really nice house right by the beach, and he's got a pool. - [Annie] Beautiful house right by the beach. - [Carol] Dad? - It smells in here. - Annie. Dad, you here? - Hey everybody. - Thank goodness you're here. You remembered we were coming? - Yeah, after the fifth call I was pretty sure today was the day. (Sneezing) - Bless you. - [Father] Grandpa Don, you look great. - [Grandpa] Well you look the same. - Thanks. - Still peddling insurance? - Advertising. - Just kidding. You know, the last time I saw you you were missing two front teeth. But you've gotten so pretty now. Like a young woman. Well, got you all set up, kid. Your own room right next to mine. Your own little kingdom, or queendom I should say. - Great. - Great. - Offer still stands. I can fix up the other room for you two. - We already got a condo. - I'm staying here by myself? - We thought it would give you and grandpa a chance to bond. - We'll all be together, sort of. - I can sleep on your couch. You won't even know I'm there. - Annie, your mom and I need some time together. I'll make it up to you, I promise. - You always say that. - Do you think they'll be okay together alone? - Yeah, they're gonna be fine. Listen... - I don't think this is such a good idea. - [Father] Everybody's going to have a great time. - We'll check back with you around dinner time. - No problemo. - Annie, you help your grandpa, okay? And stay close to the house please. You have my cell phone number. And the number to the condo is... (Gentle music) - Nice pool. - Oh, did you notice we have two turtles in the pool? I named them George and Gracie. So, you want the grand tour? - No thanks. - [Grandpa] Want a cold drink? - Do you have lemonade? - I have iced tea. - I don't like iced tea. - I'll have to remember that. Too bad I don't have lemonade. I could have made you an Arnold Palmer. That's a famous golf, well anyway. So how was your flight? - Fine. - I don't mind flying, but Dee, your grandma, she used to hate it. She had a whole crazy ritual and everything. How's school? - It's summer. School's over. - Right. Well, did you have a good year? How did it end up? - Fine. - What about the musical theater? I mean did you do any new plays? - We did grease. - Grease. That sounds messy. This place is such a dump. There's crud everywhere. His pool is all dirty. And there are sea creatures there's living in it. It's so humid. It's sticky. And everything smells so bad. This place needs some fun and Lysol. - Ooh, what's it smell like? - Every room is different. I mean, the living room smells like the back of a cab. This room smells like an old tire. - You're going to be down there for half of the summer? You're never going to make it. - I know. You know what, could you do me a favor? Go online to find out the bus schedules, okay? I'll call you later. (Whimsical music) (Metal creaking) - Howdy Dutch. - You ever going to get things fixed proper around here? - Where have you been? You missed lunch. Annie, say hello to my buddy Barney. You're going to like her. She's a peach. - [Barney] Oh, I love fruit. - Hi. - Hi. I... - She's a little shy. - Sassy too. - Well she's 12. It's an independent age. - The boy chasing age. Reminds me of when Sally Evans tried to smooch me in the pumpkin patch at the state fair. - I've heard that story five times. - So you got her stuck over in that janitor's closet you call a guestroom, huh? - At least I've got guests in my guest room. - What do you plan on doing with her? I mean, sociality is not exactly your strong point. - We're going to have a lot of fun. There's cards and puzzles. Go for walks on the trails. - Take her fishing. When my granddaughter Ashley comes she gets such a thrill out of that whenever she's here. - Ah the old skiff is not sea worthy now. Motor conks out. - Well then you get it fixed. - Why don't you just stop talking to me? - [Barney] You invited me over here. - [Grandpa] No I didn't. You just showed up. - [Barney] Well I didn't just show. You know, you invited me. I have other people that I can... - [Grandpa] I'll bet you do. - [Barney] You think you're the only fish in the sea? There are plenty of people that enjoy me. - [Grandpa] All right, all right, did you bring the cards? (Indistinct chatter) - Well, we better get going. Big day tomorrow. We're going to go up to Charleston and check out some properties and visit fort Sumter. - Guess I'm not invited? - We'll do whatever you want when we get back. - Like fly back to New York? - Annie and I have some plans of our own. I thought I'd teach her to play chess. - Better get my sleep then. I need some air. - All of a sudden there I am face to face with this huge snake. I mean he was seven feet if he was an inch. Now I didn't know it was poisonous. I didn't care. I reached for my trusty, Jim bowie knife and shoo shoo shoo, instant snakeskin boots. - Mom never went back to dangerous fusky with you after that. - That's a great story. Hey Annie, you're missing these. Your grandpa's full of them. - I'm sure he's full of something. - What's that? - I said I haven't seen any wild animals yet. We've been inside all day. - You two better stick together. Especially at night. - Afraid a snake will eat me? - Maybe, or captain Jack. - Who's that? - Captain Jack stoney, a patriot rebel from the revolutionary war. That's his house there that he built. After he died one of his grandkids saw Jack, lost it in an all night poker game. Captain Jack was so furious that he came back from the dead to haunt this house and all the woods around it. So all these woods are haunted. - Guess I'll need my trusty David bowie knife. - Annie. - It's fine. So the dock is over here, and I thought one day maybe I'd take Annie out on the water for a little fishing. - You have a boat? - Yeah. - No boat. - It's a pull start, Annie, just like a lawn mower. Well that's old ironsides. - You ever take him out? - Ah, not for a while. Mostly just sits there collecting barnacles. You see this island, right around the bend over here, and across the calliboggie sound, you can see the bridge that took you in here. - Can we go for a ride? - No Annie. Daddy, you haven't used that clunker in years. - Well, I thought we'd just dip our Poles in, you know, nothing fancy. - Well it's easy to lose your balance on that thing. Trust me, I fell overboard plenty when I was growing up. - That's right, you never really learned to swim. - I never really had a teacher. And your granddaughter is no Mark Spitz either. Annie, listen to me. I do not want you on that boat. Promise me you won't go on it. Promise me. - I heard you already. You think I'm stupid? Just leave me alone. - Honey... - You guys are gonna have so much fun. (Gentle music) (Static buzzing) (Speaking in Spanish) (Static buzzing) (Soft snoring) (Gentle cheerful music) (Dog barking) - [Annie] Come here, doggie. Where'd you go? Come here, boy. Where are you? Come here, doggie. Where'd you go? (Spooky music) (Intensifying music) (Gasping) It's you! You're captain Jack! (Man mumbling) Get away from me! (Man mumbling) (Annie screaming) Help, help! Please help me! I just saw captain Jack! He tried to attack me! He's still out there! (Laughing) (Giggling) So your grandpa's Barney? I kinda met him. - Skinny guy, old, kind of banged up. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I pass through here every now and then. I'm a musician on my way to L.A. I'm going to meet with this producer who did Ashanti's first disc. I'm getting ready to lay down tracks for my debut album next week. - That's so cool. Gonna be famous. - Yeah. So what kind of music you listen to? - Everything. Lilics, gbe, men and marbles. - Yeah, I'm a hip hop girl myself. That's the kind of music that's going on my album. - That's cool. People here probably haven't even heard of it yet though. - You got that right. Wilton head. You're a pretty cool chick. - Thanks. - Do you want one? - Um, no I quit. - Right. Well, here we are. If you see captain Jack again just turn and run the other way. - Right - I'll see you around. - Thanks. If you want to hang out again sometime. (Slow music) (Bird squawking) What the heck was that? (Bird chirping) (Banging on window) Stupid bird. Go away, I'm sleeping. Go away. (Window slamming) (Annie screaming) - Oh! (Annie screaming) - Oh! - Can't you see I'm in here? What are you doing, get out! - I didn't know you were... - Get out, go! Close the door! (Annie screaming) - Oh! (Annie screaming) Oh! I'm sorry. I'm just going to close the door. - Just go! - I'm going. (Door slamming) - What's that? - Grits, they're delicious. Good, huh? - It tastes like a wet napkin. - Try a little butter and salt. - I'm on a diet. - I'll have to remember that. Well, it's going to be a hot day. Maybe we can head for the beach. - How far do we have to walk? - Walk? We'll take the eagle. (Jazzy music) I haven't stretched her legs in a while. I only take her out on special occasions. And the tags are overdue by a couple of years, but, hop in! (Engine humming) See that? Runs like a panther. (Engine sputtering) - Perfect. - How bad do you want to go to the beach? And the cockamamie agent wants to make me pay a co pay for generics. It's absurd. Gonna put me in the poor house. It's not like I'm taking, you know, some Cosmopolitan she she designer drugs. I've been a diabetic for 20 dang years. But these crooks, they just come in and... - Hey, hey. - What? - Don't curse in front of Annie. - What'd I say? Crooks? - The d word. - Drugs? Any rate, the pharmacist is an attractive gal. I will say that. But boy, what a... - [Grandpa] Barney? - Unbelievable. - So what do you think a 12 year old even does nowadays? I mean, it's the 21st century. So 12 would be 17 compared to when we were 12, and she's from the city. So 17 would be about 25 in country years. So it's like having a 25 year old stay with you. I have no idea of what a 25 year old does these days. And I know you haven't the foggiest. - The Savannah theater might have a production going on. That might be fun for her. - No, no, no. Small town theater for a big city girl? No, no way. Although that does remind me of this small town theater actress that I met. Did I... - Shh, here she comes. - So Kennedy comes on board. And he turns to me and he says, "officer, I need a guide," and there I was, showing the future president around. - [Barney] Now wait a minute. Was this before or after you single handedly foiled the bank robbery? - Oh, no way before. The bank robbery was in '78. - Right, right. (Cheerful music) Alrighty, I'm off to see those d word crooks. Meet you back here. - Okay, bye bye. Care for a trip to the gas station? I need some go go juice for the eagle. - No thanks. I think I'll just window shop. - Okay, here. Get yourself a soda pop. (Audience applauding) - [Man] Hello harbour town. Wow, what a crowd. You're too kind. Thanks everyone for coming out today. You'll recognize this. It's one of my greatest hits. This one goes out to all the ladies. ♪ Your name and mine ♪ ♪ it's called a dream ♪ ♪ it tells the world ♪ ♪ what you mean to me ♪ - Hey honey. I see you've met Lance, one of our local talents. - Talents? He sounds like a dying whale. - [Grandpa] Well he's no Perry Como, I'll give you that. He still needs to practice. - For what? - Well for the midsummer festival. It's a community thing. Anybody with a voice and a lot of nerve can strut their stuff. A few years back we had a guy who used to play a guitar and sing here to a packed crowd. Thousands of people every night. Spectacular. Now... - This is disgusting! - [Annie] So what happened? - I don't know. One day I guess he just gave it up. - Maybe captain Jack ate him. - Hey guys, hey. Train's leaving. You may have to help me drive. I've been robbed blind. Oh that's a nice purse you got there, captain. - [Announcer] Last of the seventh. Two outs, man on first and third. Trying to get back in this game. There's a good chance for them to get back in. - You can't talk to ballplayers anymore. I remember this one time I was at Yankee stadium. Mickey mantle came up to bat, and I shouted to him from the stands. I said, "hey Mick, tuck your elbow in." He turned and he nodded to me. And the first pitch out, bam, right over the fence. And I swear he tipped his cap to me as he rounded third. Remember another time I was doing a security detail with Elvis, and we were backstage at some big arena. - Ah, that's it! I can't take it anymore! - What? - All your lies. Killing snakes. Hanging out with presidents. Now you worked for Elvis? - It's true. - The truth is you're pathetic. Telling lies to impress others. May be able to fool Barney, but not me. (Slow music) - Annie? - [Annie] Leave me alone! (Indistinct radio chatter) - [Holly] 85 bucks is the cheapest one. It gets you here but with a bunch of stops. - I don't care about the stops. 110, enough for a decent meal and a ticket. When is it? - [Holly] Tomorrow, 6:30 am. - Is there another one? - [Holly] Thursday. - Forget that. Just don't forget to pick me up at the station, okay? - [Holly] You owe me one. Good luck. - Yeah. (Slow music) (Alarm beeping) Take that, you stupid bird. (Gentle music) Great. (Grunting) (Screaming) (Dramatic music) Help, somebody help! (Gasping) Help, somebody! (Gasping) Somebody help! Help, help, help! Help! - Annie! Annie! - Notice all the lace that's hand tatted and the intricate and delicate eyelet work. Now if you'll follow me into the next room, I'll be showing you... (Phone beeping) - Will you stop already? You've been calling it every five minutes. - I just want to hear their voices. Make sure they're okay. - I'm sure they're having a great time. Unlike some people I know. Come on, all the good stuff's in this room. (Dog panting) (Annie screaming) - No, it's all right, it's okay! - No, you stay away from me! - Sonia! - You just stay back! Stay back! - What, what what? (Annie screaming) Relax, relax! - Who are you people? - Just relax. Relax, I'm Sonia. This is Greg. You're safe. If it wasn't for Greg, you'd still be under. - Grandpa's boat. Oh no. - We didn't catch your name. - Annie. - Well, Annie, your clothes are drying. So I dressed you in these. - Your daughter's. - Greg's, his daughter Lauren. This is his house. You had us worried. I didn't know who to call for you. No ID, no anything. Just a plastic bag full of money. Hungry? Easy, easy child. There's plenty more where that come from. (Gentle music) - I just wanted to say thank you. - It's okay. - You build boats? - Not really. I'm a handyman. I fix things. - Greg's been helping folks out around here for years. - The other night in the woods, I thought you were captain Jack. (Chuckling) - Greg's got a lot of spirit, honey, but he ain't no ghost. - Yeah, I'm really sorry. The other night I was picking up my groceries. I really didn't mean to scare you. - You didn't. I mean, it was night and like thick woods. You know. - [Sonia and Greg] City kid. - How'd you know? - Seen it all before. Y'all have a hard time to adjusting down here. It's where's the mall! Where's the arcade? Where's my cable TV? - This is supposed to be a vacation. No fun. No hangouts. No cool music. I mean, there's just nothing to do around here. - Well, down here we have different kinds of music. You know, we have the leaves and the trees and the sound of the birds. - Trust me. That bird waking me up every morning deserves to be shot. (Chuckling) - Well, I bet your grandpa has a collection of cool stuff. - Yeah, dust. And ancient records. Stuff like jazz and Tommy dorky. No young music. (Chuckling) What about your daughter? What does she like? - Well, you know, she, Lauren, she's likes uh... - Your parents must be worried about you. - I'm staying with my grandpa. - Well, Greg doesn't have a phone, and I live just right up the road. You can call him from there. - Actually, I don't know his number. - Well, you know his address, don't you? - 17 something. - Well, we'll figure something out. Come on. Let's go see if the clothes are dry. - It's good! Give it to me again. Hey there, Sonia. You getting ready to MC the festival again this year? - I'm looking forward to it. - You know, I've been practicing real hard. Me, me, me. (Chuckling) So what brings you back to the old sweat shop? - Well, my friend is looking for her grandpa, Donald Brooks. You know him? (Indistinct police radio chatter) - Well, it looks like we found our missing person. (Slow music) - Hey there. Anybody up for a game of rummy? - Where the heck have you two been? - Or maybe solitaire. - We've been calling and calling worried sick about you two. - [Father] You were calling. I said they were fine. - All right, let's have it. - Mom... - It was all my fault. I dragged her into harbour town because I had to run some errands. - All day long? - We had some car trouble. - What is wrong with you? Didn't it occur to you that this godforsaken jalopy might break down or worse yet, get in an accident? - I'm sorry. - You're the adult here. It seems like Annie's got a lot more common sense than you do. - [Father] Carol. - Don't Carol me. I have every reason to be angry. Annie, you go inside now. Go. Go! We were calling and calling and raced back here to sit on that porch and wait for you for an hour. Then it just turns out that you're driving around in this clunker, doing errands. - [Grandpa] We just thought it would take a few minutes. - [Carol] Why didn't you call? - I don't have one of those cell phones. - Well there are payphones. Didn't you listen to me? I didn't want Annie to go. - I didn't know you were telling me not to leave the house. - You okay? - Yeah. It's just, why does she have to be so hard on him? - Well, you know your mom and grandpa Don, they don't always get along. It's kind of been like that for awhile. - So then why did we come here? - Well Annie, family is important. And just because you don't agree with everybody doesn't mean you don't care about them. - Dad, this morning I, I, I got up early. I've been having trouble sleeping. - Do you want to pack up your stuff and stay with us tonight? - No, I'm fine. - You sure? - Really. Plus you and mom deserves some quality time.

(Chuckling) - Grandpa, I just... - I'm just glad you're all right. - What was grandma Dee like? - She was nice. She was very nice. - No, I mean I really want to know, really. - When I first met her I had goosebumps. She was a cheerleader from the rival high school team across town. I was a wide receiver and I was trying to impress her with my acrobatic catches. On this one play I ran out of bounds, and I ran right up to her and she said, "who are you?" And I said, "I'm the man you're going to marry someday." - No way. - Yeah. She didn't want to date me at first. But I sent her a single yellow Rose every day for two weeks. And she finally gave in, and after a few years she said, "I do." - How long were you married? - This August would have been our 48th anniversary. - I'm so sorry. I really didn't mean... - No, no it's all right. She's still here. She's all over this house. That chess set there is a good example. Bring it over. That's it. Your grandma gave me this in 1957. She had it engraved. - To Donald, love Dee. August 1957. Wow. It's beautiful. Can you teach me how to play? - On one condition. - What's that? - That we'll go out and buy you a new wardrobe.

Oh yeah, takes you back, huh? - Grandpa, can I drive? - What, you wanna get us killed? - Oh come on. - No, what if a cop saw us or worse, your mother. - There are only three cops on this island. And all I do is play paper football all day. - Look, driving a car is a little harder than driving a boat, and I think we all know how that turned out, Missy. - I don't know, Annie. - Okay, I guess when I'm your age I won't be able to tell my grandkids my grandpa taught me how to drive. Just have to tell them some random boyfriend did it instead. (Tires screeching) - [Barney] Are you crazy, captain? - [Grandpa] Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch. Live a little. - [Barney] Yeah, well I'd like to live a lot. That's the problem. (Whimsical music) - You'll be okay, Barney. I'm a good driver. - Yeah, I just hope they spell my name right in the obituaries. Take it easy, yeah. - Turn a little bit to your right, to your right. - Just watch out, watch out, there's a... - Oh oh! - Are you happy now? Why don't we practice stopping. Let's practice stopping.

I know we're not always happy. - Honey, I don't know anyone who's always happy. You know, it's hard. Long business hours and trips, and it's just the way it is for now. - Yeah. I grew up that way. My daddy was always gone. He was never there for me, and I resented it, and now I'm putting him here. I know it's the responsible thing to do. One day Annie's gonna do the responsible thing too. - Yeah, well maybe to you. She likes me. - That's it. That's it! - Annie, you're not going to believe this. - What? - That's checkmate. - It is? - [Grandpa] You win. - I win? I beat you? I beat you! Yippee, I did it! Finally I... - What's all the racket? - I just beat grandpa at chess! Yes! (Whimsical music) (Gentle guitar music) - Oh wow, hey. I was just putting away some old stuff. Just messing around. - I made you some frogmore stew and hoppin' John. Thought you might be hungry. - Thanks. - Um hum. Sounded good. - [Grandpa] That's fresh local shrimp, Annie. Best you can get. - Wow, grandma's famous seafood gumbo is a lot of work. - Yeah, I can't say I always helped out either. I usually found some excuse or other to get out of it. - Kind of like me with mom. I guess we're a lot of like, huh? - Yeah. Of course the thing is, I regret it now. All those, all those times I could have been with her, and I wasn't. - It was lung cancer, right? - Yeah. - Don't be like me, Annie girl. Be better than me. Find time for those people you care about. (Door slamming) (Woman shouting) - Are you okay? - Carol? - She's fine. - I'm not fine. That dumb thing almost killed me. (Loud crashing) - Can't believe you forgot about my security system. - Yeah, it usually prevents people from spying. - I wasn't spying. - This is really good. - Um hum. - We copied it exactly from grandma's old recipe. - I'm pretty sure daddy didn't do it from memory. - Annie, you should ask your mother how I used to find her when she ran away from home. - You used to ditch? - Wasn't on for that leaky container I might've made it all the way to Alaska. (Chuckling) - Container? This little rebel one day decided to pack up and leave, right? I look outside and there's a trail of seafood gumbo all the way to the main road. - No way. - I followed it to the drain depot. And there she was with a wet pillowcase. - I love that story. You did some crazy things when you were a kid. You were a rebel. - I had a lot to rebel against. - So what have you guys been up to? - Nothing much. Just buying junk food, trying on bikinis. Grandpa let me drive his car, and oh yeah, we always got arrested. - Ha, ha, ha. - The detail in this furniture was incredible. And to think that you were sitting in a chair that was 150 years old. - Wow, that's almost as old as I am. - You take any pictures? - Yeah a bunch. Go get mom's camera. I'll show them to you. - Cool. - Honey, is that a new shirt? I don't remember seeing it before. - This old thing? You really hit your head hard, didn't you? (Indistinct chatter) (Slow piano music) Retirement home? - [Father] Annie, you finding it okay? - Be right out. - [Father] Okay. (Knocking on door) - Goodnight, Annie. You okay? - Yeah. - You sure? - Grandpa? - Yeah? - Nevermind. I love you. - You are going down today, captain. I feel like king rummy. - You mean king dummy? - Ha, ha, ha, you wish. - Can I go visit Ashley? - Are you tired of us old croakers? - See you. - Now you tell her no screaming, pop rock, hippity hop jam sessions over there. - You're really hip. - It's hip, as in replacement. - You too? - Um hum. - Hey ash. - Cool chick. - [Annie] I heard you were back in town. How was L.A.? - I got bumped, postponed by outcast. - No way? - I was in the studio getting ready to lay down my vocs, right? Producer gets a phone call. Andre 3000 needs the studio. - He told you that? - Well, no, but he told my boyfriend. I mean, I was there. I know what went down. All political, you know. I heard you got thrown in the clink for kifing a boat. - I need your help with a secret, girls only mission. Interested? - Will it effect Barney if he finds out? - Probably. - What do you have in mind? (Whimsical music) - Gramps, I'm taking Annie fishing. Don't worry, I'll be safe. - All right, but do not let Annie drive. - What? This family cannot drive. - Oh, well what do you call it when you ran into the old oak tree down by the bridge last summer? - Because there was a cat in the road. I had to swerve to miss the cat. It's called defensive drive. - Offensive driving is more like it. - I ever tell you the story about that cat? - Four times. - Well you tell me yours 400. - [Grandpa] Just mail your stories to me, will you? - [Barney] Well yours would be about 800 pages if you printed them out. - [Grandpa] Are we going to play cards or what? (Engine humming) - [Annie] This is great! (Gentle music) Go faster. - Okay! - Faster, ash! (Hammer pounding) Hi Greg! (Horn honking) - Oh man, I hope she didn't steal another boat. - Glad you're home. - Thanks. Does your grandpa know you're here? - No. - Annie! - It's okay, I've got my friend with me. Ashley, this is... - Greg Russell. - Yeah. - You know him? - Are you kidding? You were a huge inspiration to me growing up. Watching you and harbour town. Green-eyed monster. I love this harbor. The unicorn song. I know them all by heart. - Great, that's nice, thanks. - Well what happened to you? You look all beat up. And why'd you stop singing? I mean you just disappeared. - I don't know. - Sing us a tune. - No. - A duet. We could do a rad version of I love this harbor. - Listen, I just don't sing anymore, all right. I'm really sorry. I've got work to do. - Greg, wait. I came for help. I need you to fix something. My family. - [Ashley] Now this is a nice house right by the beach. - [Annie] Yeah. (Doorbell ringing) - Well look what the cat dragged here. - [Annie] I found it in my mom's purse. I just know they're going to put him in a retirement home. - [Ashley] Annie, his house is a dump. - [Annie] I really need your help, please. - So your grandfather doesn't know anything about this? You're talking lots of home improvements here, Annie. - I know, but if we can just show my mom that grandpa's turned his life around, I know she'll let him stay. Look, there's over a hundred dollars in here. I'm sure you charge more, but maybe I can work it off for you. - Could buy some paint, some brushes. - You know, if we sold some of this stuff off, we could buy him a new house. (Chuckling) - Yeah, I didn't know having a beauty salon could make you a billionaire. - Sugar, I may own my own beauty salon, but there is not that much money in dye jobs and perms. Generations of my family worked for the owners of this house. The last owner was like a second father to me. He passed and he left me the house in his will. - Good thing you never put him in a retirement home. - City kid. - So how do you plan on getting your grandfather out of the house for the day? - Haven't figured that one out yet. - I have an idea. (Cheerful music) - [Grandpa] Beauty salon? - Congratulations. You have been randomly selected to receive our special king for a day makeover, compliments of Sonia's beauty palace. - I don't need a make over. - Come on grandpa. When was the last time you had a really nice haircut? - What's wrong with my hair? Besides, I don't need anything fancy. - What about a manicure with a shave and a facial? - A facial what? - It feels good, trust me. - Hey, you're never going to guess what I just won? - That salon must be desperate. - Well, king for a day. I like the way that sounds. Not too sure about this face thing though. - You don't know about facials? What, you've been living under a rock? - I'm willing to give it a try. You'll try anything if it's free. - How about you two go together? Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Oh what, no good? You got a bank robbery you have to foil or something? - No, I was hoping to spend it with Annie. Not getting my legs waxed. - It's only for a day, and Ashley's here. - Come on captain. When's the last time we got to be kings? For free? - You're right. This could be good. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Look at this facial. Pedicure, whatever that is. Oh, that's feet I think. - [Grandpa] Feet, okay manicure. It's gotta be for a man. That's for a man. - [Barney] We're men. - [Grandpa] Yeah, okay, why not? Massage. (Horn honking) (Gentle music) (Engine humming) - How'd it go? - It's on. - All right. (Cheerful music) Good gracious. I mean, no problem. - Ashley and I will start in the back. - Let's go. (Loud thudding) I guess I'll start right here. - This doesn't make us, you know, less than men? - You know, why doesn't our barbershop ever have king for a day? - Anybody looking? - No, nobody I know anyway. - One, two... (Whimsical music) - You must be Donald and Barney. I'm Sonia. This is my salon. Welcome, you're right on time. Come right on here.

Like... ♪ I love harbor ♪ ♪ means so much to mean ♪ ♪ I've been most everywhere ♪ - That was a violation of music. My music. - That was one of your songs? - Yeah. But I like to think I sang it a little bit better than that. - Did you enjoy singing? I mean years ago in front of all those people? - Yeah. It was fun watching the magic happen. - Magic? - You know, songs touch us all in different ways, young and old. But when you can sing a song that touches everybody in the same way, it's a wonderful thing to see. - So then why did you stop? - Well, let's just say I lost the desire. Singing comes from a very personal place. Oh, we should be getting back. We've got a lot of work to do. - Mistake. Is that your car? - Yeah, but it was it parked in front of Sonia's salon? - Yeah but... - Did you see the no parking sign? - Yeah, but... - No mistake. - Look fellow, do we look like lawbreakers? - Not with them fancy haircuts and manicured fingers. Sweet perfume. Are y'all together? - [Men] No! - Y'all from California? - No! We're locals! Look at the license plate. - Those tags overdue? - So what's it going to cost me to get my car out of here? - Well, you got your service call. Got your hook up. Got the towing, of course. There's storage at an hourly rate. Tell you what, on second thought I think we're just going to call it even. I believe you people. Be back in a jiff. - You people? I told you we shouldn't have got the manicure. - No, no, no you can't go out that way. The paint's still wet. (Phone ringing) - Hello? - They're on their way. - [Sonia] No, you gotta stall them. We're not finished yet. - I'd be more than happy to. As long as Reed gets top billing on your show. - Okay deal, deal! Lance you just got bumped. Everybody! Okay look, your grandpa's on the way back. We've got to get this place finished up. Come on, hop to it! Let's get this mopped. Ashley, get the broom, come on! - Bravo two. - [Reed] Reed here. - Reed, got good news for you, but I'm going to ask you to do a little something for me first. - [Grandpa] Have I been drinking? - I noticed you swerving the last quarter mile. - That's this car, officer. It's overdue for inspection. - Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step outside the vehicle. - Oh no, he has not been drinking. - [Grandpa] Oh shut up! - [Barney] Really, he hasn't been. - [Grandpa] Don't make it worse. - Feet together, please. Arms out. (Cheerful piano music) - [Father] Carol, just settle down. I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explana... Wow. - [Carol] What's going on here? (Gasping) - Who are you? - [Carol] Who are you people? Where's my dad? - Now just wait right there. Honey, call the police. - Wait, wait, wait! It's okay! - Hang on here, hang on, hang on. - No need for that. - [Greg] There is no reason to call the police. - Boy what a day. - Yep. - I can't wait to get home and relax. Get some peace and quiet. - Yeah, you can say that again, captain. Uh oh. (Doors slamming) - Where have you been? - We were getting facials. - Excuse me? - Uh oh. - What's going on here. What have you done to my house? - We're friends of Lauren. (Slow music) I mean, Annie. Excuse me. - Greg? Surprise. - Honey, you know if you wanted to help out, if you wanted to arrange of cleanup day, you should have told us. We're your family, you know, we don't keep secrets from each other. - Sure as heck don't lie. That's not the daughter I am raising - no more lies. No more secrets. (Slow music) (Pebbles popping) - Wow, they sure fixed a lot of things. - Oh, everything's fixed. Except me, according to you. - Dad, can we just talk about this? - Will it matter? You've already made up your mind. You could've told me anytime. I've been around. - No you haven't been around. Never been around for me. - Oh, so that's it. So this is about getting even with me, revenge? - Will you stop it? I worry. I always worried. When mom was sick I'm the one who had to take care of everything. You were always gone. You were always away. - I was working. I was traveling. I was supporting you and your mom. What did you want me to do? - I wanted you to tuck me in! I wanted you to help me with my homework! I wanted you to tell me I was pretty at the prom. I just, I just wanted you to tell me you felt. - I had those feelings. I just, it's different now. Annie is just like you. Maybe parents get better with age. - Not for me. Just keeps getting harder. - That's because you're holding on too tight. Annie's a good kid. Just need to loosen the reins a little. - I'm afraid if I let go, she won't want to come back. - The person who did all this isn't trying to run away. - Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? - It's a lot nicer than a retirement home. I'm not ready for that. There's still some life in this old skiff yet. - I know. Maybe we could stay in touch more? Talk once a week on the phone? - What's New York like at Christmas? - Can you wait up a minute? - I'll be chilling over here. - Annie, I just don't think it's a good idea for you to come around here anymore. - Look, I just want to apologize for today, to Sonia too. - You don't have anything to be sorry for. - Except for the way my parents treated you. - Well, someday you'll understand what that's all about. - You should know how much I appreciate what you did for me. - You mean what I did for your grandpa? - No, me. Your daughter's not around anymore, is she? - No. (Slow music) She died. My wife and beautiful little daughter, Lauren, were killed by a drunk driver almost five years ago. - That's why you stopped singing. - So much of what I used to do and be was because of them. It'll just never be the same. - Does it has to be? Grandpa never thinks about the bad times he had with grandma. But he keeps her spirit alive by remembering the good things. - All those good things were a part of my music. - Maybe that's the best way to remember then. Share your music with others. That's where the magic is, remember? This guy knew how to make magic too. Good luck, Greg Russell. I'll never forget you. I had something that I had to do. - Okay. - You'll just have to add it to my jail term. With good behavior I'll be out in three years. - Maybe I'm the one that should be grounded. Nice wardrobe. I would have liked to have gone shopping with you. Look, if you want to tell me something or share your life with me, I'm here. - Then I'll always be in trouble. - I'll try to lighten up. But it doesn't mean it's okay for you to sneak out. We have to find some common ground. Deal? - Deal. - I'm so I'm so proud of you. - Thanks mom. - Where is your suitcase? Nevermind. (Upbeat music) (Indistinct chatter) - Is hotter than a fire poker out here. Whoa, I ever tell you about the time when I took Dee to see the wonderful Tommy Dorsey. - Tommy Dorsey. Stafford hotel in New York City. - It was the hottest part... - Seven, seven. - I told you that seven... - Yes, you did. - Hey there. - Hi. - What 'cha doing? - [Annie] Nothing, just out here with my family. - So are you going to the festival tonight? - Maybe. Are you going to go? - Yeah. You should come to it. It's going to be real fun. I mean, it'll be real good if you want. - Okay. - So maybe I'll see you there. Well, I should probably go.
