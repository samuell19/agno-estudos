(GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) MAN: You there? You're fucking dead. You hear me? I said you're fucking dead. (METAL CLATTERING) (PHONE RINGING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) MARKUS: Yeah. ZANDER: Markus, it's Zander. You ready for this one? This guy, he's named Dixon Jones. His picking up little over one million cash dollars near downtown. He goes there two hours from now. This job is simple for you. Get cash from him, and bring to me at loading dock near port right after. I be there three hours. Don't be late. Questions? MARKUS: No. ZANDER: Good. In few minutes, I text you address and vehicle make and model he will be in. I also text you picture of him. Don't lose these things, and delete this number and text after I hang up. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (METAL THUDDING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (TRAIN ENGINE RUNNING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) What's up? ZANDER: I double checked the cash. It's all here. This is good. Now I owe you. You stay safe out there, Markus. Yeah. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) FRANK: Markus, it's Frank. You there? Yeah. FRANK: How you doing? Life treating you well? I can't complain. FRANK: That's good to hear. I got something for you, something I think will grab your interest. You got a minute? Yeah, what do you need? FRANK: It's better if we talk in person. Can you come down to my place? What time? FRANK: Say in about an hour or so? All right. Thanks, I'll see you soon. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Thank you for coming by, Markus. It's been crazy busy around here lately. Now I know I asked you earlier, man, but how'd that job go with Caesar you did a while back? MARKUS: It was fine. What do you want? (LAUGHING) Typical Markus, man. I like your style, man, your sense of business, always straight to the chase. Now I know you're not gonna ask me how things have been on my end. (LAUGHING) All right, all right, I'll cut straight to the chase. I won't waste any more time. There's a man by the name of Vernon Boyd, ex-convict, bank robber, murderer, served 10 years in the state penitentiary for beating down a man with a metal bar. He also never paid me in full for a job we did down in South America. He owes me a lot of cash (MUMBLING). MARKUS: How much? Easy peavy, don't worry about that. Word is, him and his guys hit a casino and walked out with $12 million. Could have been more, man, but the cops showed up earlier than expected. This is a big moneymaker, Markus. It's something I know you'd wanna be a part of. (METAL CLICKING) (PAPERS RUSTLING) MARKUS: What's this? Everything you need to know about this guy, his picture, address, warehouse where he does business from, how many guys he's got working for him, what he drives, wife's middle name, everything. It's everything, if you know what I mean. When do you need it? As soon as possible. I told you I was going out of town in a couple weeks, and only call me if you have any questions. Once you get what I need, no evidence of this guy. Understood? Okay. Right on, Markus. Always a pleasure to see you. I thought I heard you left town for good. Nah, I've been around. You know, you and I, we're in a risky business. Staying low key's not easy, especially around here. Do you remember what happened to that guy I hired to do that job up in Oakland? Yeah, I do. He was good at everything he did, just like you, maybe a better driver, though. (LAUGHING) I'm just fucking with you, Markus. Lighten up a little bit, man. Now you've come a long way from when you first started, and I commend you for that. Haven't seen too many people do that around here, but just don't get cocky, man, and you'll continue to do well. Don't you ever, ever mistake my kindness for weakness. We good? Yeah, we're good. FRANK: Well, then that's all I got, man. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Who is it? Frank. STACI: What type of job? Money till. What's he offering? His typical. STACI: His typical? Yeah, his typical. Look, it's getting late, and I got to run to the airport to pick up Tommy. I don't really have time to discuss any of this. I'll call you later, okay? All right, sure. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (PAPER RUSTLING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) (METAL CLICKING) (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (WATCH TICKING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (PENCIL SCRATCHING) (METAL CLATTERING) (PAPER RUSTLING) All right, hit me. (LAUGHING) I've never been any good at this game, man. I try. I try pretty damn hard. Yeah, I remember you giving me a few pointers back in the day, but I don't think it's paying any dividends. Maybe one day though, huh? So when do you leave town? Not till the end of the month. WATTS: Word. Guess that's when business slows down for you? Yeah. You know, I'm not always that busy myself. My wife and kids, they keep me plenty busy, and I like staying busy, but with work, you know what I mean? Always a good thing. Making a steady income is a necessity for me, and this business is tough, Markus, very tough business. I think about it from time to time, get the fuck out, maybe work in something steady, something safe. People can get hurt, and I know you know. I've been doing this since I was age 17, lost my youngest brother when I was 20. Julian. Yeah, Julian. You know he was shot by some of Victor's boys from south of the border, a deal we had lined up in Glendale? It's his fault though. I gave him his instructions perfectly, and he didn't listen. I know. I know you know, but the reason I bring this up right now is because I want us synchronized for this job and any job that we do in the future. I tell this to anyone that I do multiple jobs with. I wanna go home at the end of every job. We all do. Good, good, that's rule number one, always will be. I want that to be crystal clear from day one. Okay, so Nigel called me about this deal with Reuben in Tijuana, right? And supposedly there's a warehouse with a pot of cash in it located Boyle Heights, Arts District, basically the east end of LA. Yes. WATTS: Okay, okay, and so this is supposedly vacant, this spot, right, where they keep their goods, their drugs, their money, whole nine yards? That's correct. Listen, I know you got a 40% split with Reuben, and you're gonna take his end of the cash down and meet him in TJ? Okay, yeah, okay, I'm cool with it. We can do what we agreed to over the phone, if that's all you can do, (LAUGHING) the 35% for me and the 65 for you. I do got a wife and kids, a family to support. I'm just a single man. All right. However, we don't need to bring anyone else in on this deal at all, just you and me, especially if this place is vacant. You know how fast I work. (WOOD SCRAPING) This the place? MARKUS: That's it. Doesn't look like nothing special. When do you wanna hit it? Within the next two days. Reuben wants the money early next week. WATTS: Okay, well, that should be plenty of time for us to prep, and I assume you already scouted the location, the streets, in case Five-0 shows up? Of course. You know, if you can provide a floor plan, that'd be very helpful, but not necessary. I mean, yeah, you know what? Actually, yeah, I know where the cash is located based on what Reuben told you over the phone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can make this happen. This is all doable, absolutely. Check it out. If I'm not out of here in a few minutes, just take the fuck off, man. I'll find my own way home, and once we get that money, more importantly, once everyone gets their portion of the cash, we'll all be happy, right? Do you want this? (WOOD SCRAPING) Oof, you read my mind. (MUMBLING) This is good beer. You know I love light beer? Always have, it's my favorite. I don't really drink dark beer, man. I've been drinking that shit for like 10 years. It makes me sick. My wife, she's got me on that rum and whiskey though. Hard alcohol, I think that's probably number one. It keeps you sexy, keeps you thin, don't get too full. Beer's good though every here and there, after a few rum and whiskeys. Yeah, on that note, here's to a new endeavor. (GLASS CLINKING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (WATCH TICKING) (METAL THUDDING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (PAPER RUSTLING) Thank you. (MUMBLING) Thank you. That's good. This shit looks real good, man. I think Reuben should be pleased. We didn't get hurt, got what he wanted, well, I mean, we got what we all wanted, right? No motherfucking cops showed up either. Yeah, this should hold me up for the next little bit, least till the next gig. Got to thank you, man. I really needed the money. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Hey, you know, vice versa, man. If I hear of any jobs that require your specific services, I'll be sure to hit you up, good jobs too, man, pay good rate. There's some cheap ass motherfuckers around here, and I know you know who I'm talking about, try to rip you off, pay you half price, sometimes don't pay nothing at all, man. It's stupid though. Reputation's everything in this city. I'm sure it'll spread around like wildfire. Hey, you think this shit has changed in the last 10 years? People been coming around from all over the country trying to make a name for themselves, trying to live the dream. Yeah. (LAUGHING) Yeah. I agree. (BAG ZIPPING) Me, myself, I try to learn something new every day, man, whether it's about my job or this city. I make a point of it. Other motherfuckers keep their head in the dirt, man, and they'll stay there. It's their choice, cracks me up. All right, I'm gonna dip. I got shit to do at the crib, a few more business deals too down the pipeline. Hopefully they work out, and if they do, I'm gonna bring you on, but you know this city, a lot of talk, not a lot of walk. People managing all their bullshit, man, trying to have fun, trying to live under the sun. Anyway, call me. If I don't answer, leave a voicemail, man. My phone's always on me. Thanks again. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (PHONE CHIMING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) WOMAN: Markus, it's me. Call me when you get this. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) His debt is done. I have nothing to offer. Good. Look, I'll help you and your brother with the debt, no one else. All right. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (METAL RATTLING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (FOOTSTEPS) Markus? Oh my gosh, I haven't seen you in forever. I didn't even think you lived here anymore. Where have you been? I've been here in town. Doing? Just working. Oh, okay. Well, don't be a stranger. You should stop by the next time I have people over. I'm sorry. I haven't seen you in so long. I seriously thought you had moved. Listen, the next time I have a party, I'll give you a call, or leave a little note on your doorstep. Thanks. Yeah, I've just had a lot on my mind recently with work. Oh, well, that's understandable, sort of going through the same thing myself, short staffed at the office. Plus I'm taking care of my dad. He's getting older and not doing so well, so. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. It was really good to see you. It's good seeing you too. I hope to see you again soon. Absolutely, likewise. Take care. You too. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (PHONE RINGING) WATTS: Good to hear from you, sir. What's up? Haven't heard from you in some time. MARKUS: Been busy. WATTS: That's what I've been told. Busy is good in this town, man. I know. WATTS: How can I help you, man? I wanna run a proposal by you if you have a second. WATTS: I got time. What's up? Just meet me outside my place in about half an hour. WATTS: All right, I can do that. Everything good with you? Yeah. Good. See you soon. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) Damn, man, people be really hitting you up left and right, huh? Kind of thought you was lying. I mean, I heard you was busy, but didn't know people were hitting you up every minute of every day. Same shit, new set of people. Yeah, I feel that. This is one of Frank's jobs, though, huh? It is. WATTS: When do you plan on doing this? In a few days. Look, I'm willing to work with you, as always, but I'm gonna need at least one or two guys of my choice to contract on the job. That's okay. That's why I called you for this. Yeah, I mean, if there's supposed to be a grip of dudes in this warehouse, we're gonna need at least two or three guys total to make entry, minimum. Deal? (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) All right. Who do you have in mind? I got a few people, man. Let me go through my Rolodex and narrow it down. How about I give you a call after that? I mean, most of these people Nixon referred to me. You probably know them. Okay. Every time that we worked together, it's always ended up going well, and that means a lot to me, and you, my friend, are getting quite the reputation. I'm proud of you, and I wanna keep things going in that same direction, but I'm gonna need a higher cut, 60, 40. I can work with that. Good, that's good, Markus. This is an expensive fucking city. Remember that, okay? And I'm in debt, bad debt. How so? Hector and his cousin, man, they helped pay off a few dudes from the east side of the city that helped me run a job at the port. I owe those motherfuckers quite a few dollars, but I ain't heard Frank's name in a minute. I heard that motherfucker was laying low since the surgery, spending time with family. He's a real fucking asshole. I never really liked him. Yeah, me either. But his jobs do bring in a lot of money. At the end of the day, I guess that's all that really matters, right? Yeah, fuck all that bullshit, though, man. How's Staci doing? She's good. Good. I'm glad, man. I'm really, really glad to hear that about her. My wife's been stressing me out a little bit lately. Ain't been doing too well in the money department. I'm trying to buy her a house, but I can't afford it. Only places you can afford are the surrounding areas outside of the city, and who the fuck wants to live in Santa Clarita, right? (LAUGHING) Anyway, look, I got to go. It's late. We can talk tomorrow. Send me that picture. Floor plan of the warehouse and all that would be good. Cool, I'll see you later. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN: Hey. Still need a ride? I called back, no answer. No, I'm good. I found one from my sister. Thanks, though. What's been going on? Just busy on more work stuff. WOMAN: Tommy's still offering you a job if you want it. We'll see. How's Vince? WOMAN: He's good. Surgery went well. Doctor said he will be fully recovered in six weeks. We're having his going away party next week. You should come. That's good. I'll see. Well, let's talk later. I got to run. WOMAN: Okay, talk soon, Markus. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (PHONE RINGING) FRANK: Markus, what's going on? I called you earlier and no answer. Thanks for calling me back. What's the deal with the money, man? I need more time. FRANK: How much time we talking about? Two days. FRANK: Well, get on it. I'm going out of town soon. Look, I'll have your fucking money. After I get the money, that'll be the end of our business together. FRANK: All right, Markus, whatever you say. Just call me when you have my cash so we can meet up. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (LIQUID SPRAYING) (GLASS SQUEAKING) (PHONE RINGING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (METAL THUDDING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) So there are these guys. They want to meet with you near Chinatown. They have two jobs. I vouch for you. They know your price. They pay in full. It's no problem, but I wanted to speak with you before I move forward with them because I know we didn't talk much about cash you got from Dixon Jones, but from what you tell me, everything went pretty good, right? So I counting on you for this one. MARKUS: Go on. Okay, so this jobs, is two of them. First is driving job, is easy for you, no problem, but second, little bit more complicated. There is this man. They need you to track him down, bring him to them. This man, he had a job for his father's business, caused it to crash. At the time, the cops, they were all over it, but now things little bit more quiet. He owes them explanation. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Okay, I'll hear what they have to say. Good, good, this is good opportunity for you, Markus. Trust me. There will be more work for you, but these guys, I want to help them because of contacts they have in New York City. Oh, and thank you for collecting me, giving me ride, is very nice night. It's better that we talk in person, much safer than on telephone. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) You know, this place used to belong to my grandfather. He used to use this place for his business, repairing shoes for big movie stars and movie productions. He had all the tools he wanted in here. All the big names in Hollywood would come and get their shoes G-ed up, ready for their movie premiers. Shit, they'd even come and get shoes made, custom made. Wow, I can see a lot of work coming from that industry just by itself. Yeah, the Hollywood industry was one of his biggest customers. On Fridays, they would have a huge line out the back door, definitely their busiest day. I remember me and my cousins would come every once and a while, help out. Man, he made a shit load of money, man. So what happened to the business? Did it get passed on down the family, or what? Nah, he sold it. He got too old to run it, started having health issues with his heart and a bunch of other stuff. Family didn't wanna take over the business. You have to have passion and dedication to run this, a lot of work, a lot of hard labor, but I'll tell you what. This business made him a lot of money, gave him a good life, and he bought his house when he was young, bought any car he wanted. Me personally, I chose a completely different career, as you know. I can see. You know, my old man used to own a restaurant in the town we once lived in. FRANK: Nice. Yeah. He never had any time to spend with me and my brothers though. He was always working nonstop, seven days a week, just so he can bring in money to feed the family. You know what I mean? But he made ends meet. He always paid his bills on time. I remember as a kid just seeing him going through a ton of stress, the weight of the world on his shoulders. His whole thing was he wanted to own his own restaurant and run his own cards. That was his dream. At least, that's what my auntie tells me. Yeah, nothing like working for yourself. That's for sure. Chris mentioned you wanted to talk about the job you guys did for me in Mexico. Yeah, Chris is a straightforward guy, as you know, that thinks we both deserve a second chance. I agree with him. I think we didn't fulfill the obligations on the previous job like you really wanted, so. What are you talking about? Of course you did. EDWIN: Really? Yeah, don't listen to that bullshit. You guys did a great job. Everything came in on time as expected. Listen, Chris knows how I work, man. We've done many jobs together. We go way back, and I trust his loyalty. He told you that, right? He did. Well, then he should know it went well in Mexico. Must have been a misunderstanding on his part 'cause if there was something wrong, I would have definitely let him know, but I think you and I can work together, man. I think we could work something out. Got a few things going on right now, but I'm waiting on a big money job. Then I could expand my business, invest, and run a good operation here. I hear you. Well, let's work something out. Oh, don't worry about it, man. We will. (LAUGHING) Speaking of Chris, man, what's he doing these days? EDWIN: Chris is living up in the Valley right now. He's working with a couple guys he met on a job in Philly. Is that right? Yeah, man, he's doing really good though. He's just spending a lot of time on a few different states, networking, trying to bring in the big bucks. He's been putting a lot of energy and focus into Chicago and Philly. That's good to hear. Sounds like he's on a good path. I worked in Chicago for a few years before coming to LA, lot of work there if you network and make a name for yourself, kind of like here, but this city's where the hub is, man. It's where all the work is at, all the traffic, just like Miami, right? Absolutely, it's the reason why I'm here, man, best place for taking scores. Miami, been back and forth there, not my cup of tea, you know? It's too fucking hot. Yeah, I don't like it either, man, but I'll take it over the cold snow any day. All right, man, I'll be giving you a call, man. I'll stay in touch. As soon as these jobs come through, I'll be reaching out to you. Sounds like a plan. FRANK: Right on, man. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (METAL CLICKING) (PHONE RINGING) (BAG ZIPPING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (METAL THUDDING) Man, what's up? Virgil, this is Markus. Markus, this is Virgil. You know, I know your face from somewhere, man. I'm pretty sure we worked together on a job, maybe two years ago or... Anyway, anyway, he's gonna be helping us out. He knows Nixon, so here's the deal. If we're not out of here in three minutes or less, take the fuck off. We'll find our own ride home. Virgil and I have been over this so many times. Yeah, we got this, man. Should be pretty easy, in and out. I'm ready to go. Virgil, any further questions for Markus? No explanation needed, which seems pretty fortunate. All right, let's hit it. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (METAL THUDDING) (WATCH TICKING) (GUN FIRING) (DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (PANTING) Fuck. Fucking drive, drive. (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) Fuck. We just fucking went in there, and it was so fucking dark. I swear to God, Markus. It was fucking pitch black, and out of nowhere, fucking Vernon's guys just jumped in and fucking shanked Virgil right in the fucking neck, man. I fucking shot at them, and they fucking shot back, and I just took the fuck off. I fucked up. I'm sorry. I really fucked this up, man. Everything was where you said it was, the floor plan, the cash, everything. It was just too fucking dark. It was so fucking dark. You can tell Frank that it was all my fault. I swear to God, Markus. Just tell him it was all my fucking fault. Just fucking take care of my kids if something happens to me, man. I'm fucking sorry. Markus, I'm fucking sorry, man. Fuck. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (METAL CREAKING) Look, yo, I don't know what to say, man. I'm sorry. What are you gonna tell Frank? I'm not sure yet. Well, you can tell him that I fucked it all up, okay, 'cause I did. Your hands are clean on this. I'm not gonna hold you to anything. I'll even help you get the money. We had a deal. I'm gonna get Frank his damn money, all right? That's between me and him, but our business is done now. Who'd you fucking hire? Was it strange? Who, you mean Virgil? Bro, I told you, man. I don't even know that motherfucker. Nixon set me up with him. Look, if you change your mind, call me. Look, you know where to find me, man. All right? (METAL THUDDING) (METAL SCRAPING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (PHONE RINGING) FRANK: Markus, do you have what I'm looking for? Please say you do. No. FRANK: What? What do you mean no? One of my guys got killed. We didn't get the money. FRANK: What the hell do you mean you didn't get the money? That's not what I wanna hear, Markus. I told you I was going out of town. I need that money now. You fucking failed me, man. All right, listen. Don't go looking for the money. I'm gonna call you back and tell you what to do next. Make sure you answer your phone. Later. I got an idea who it is. There's only one person who could have sent for the money. He knows we've got the money, Jimmy. I got one of my guys working on it right now. He's gonna get me everything I need to know about this. I will. I'll make a few more phone calls, and I'll get back to you with more info. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (PHONE RINGING) Hey, you got a second? Someone knows about our little secret with the job we did in Vegas at the casino. Yeah, that's right. Well, I'm gonna need your assistance in helping me find some addresses and phone numbers of someone. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) When do you have to pay Frank? Now. I think you're insane. You know Frank is gonna come down on you for not getting the cash. He'll get his money. Frank cares nothing about anyone else. He will do whatever it takes to get what he wants. His reputation is not the best here. I don't know why you continue to work with him. Now I'm sure that these other guys' people will come looking for you. Once they know he's dead and find about Watts, then Vernon's people and the cops next. None of this you care about. No. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Okay, Markus. It seems like you need some time to think. I'm gonna get going and give you some space. (PAPERS RUSTLING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) Edwin, listen, I got a job for you. I just got off the phone with Vernon. He's supposed to give me five of 12 mil. Now I'm gonna send you and Markus to go pick it up. Once you have the money, I want you to dump his ass and bury him where I told you. Then you bring me my money, understood? All right. Meet me here when you're done. (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) This is real simple, Markus, and I've been working on this for quite some time, so don't fuck it up. You're gonna deliver this bag at 11 o'clock sharp. You're gonna meet up with Clyde on Eighth and Alameda. You'll have the money, and I put a little incentive in this briefcase for you. You can check it if you want, but I know you trust me. Oh, and by the way, Clyde's got some work coming up, and I'm sure he's gonna need a good driver like you. I put in a good work, but you don't have to thank me. You can thank yourself. After all, you're the one doing all the work. Do you have any questions for me, Markus? I didn't think so. (WATCH TICKING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (METAL CLICKING) (PHONE CHIMING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) ZANDER: Markus, is Zander. I just spoke to Nelson. He has information. He is going to kill you. He's sending guy now to take care of it and use you for getting his money. Nelson told me everything. What do you mean? ZANDER: Trust me. Watch your back, Markus. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS) Markus. All right. Let's go. (METAL THUDDING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (METAL THUDDING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (METAL SCRAPING) (GRUNTING AND COUGHING) FRANK: What the fuck are you trying to tell me? You have my money, and you killed my guy? Why would I get rid of you? You're out of your fucking mind. Just bring my fucking money, Markus. I'm done with you. You better look over your shoulder this time. I know exactly where you live. You're a dead man. (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) WATTS: Yo, Markus, I just listened to your message and saw your text. Jesus, Markus, fucking Frank? Fuck, I had a feeling he would try to pull some bullshit. Look, I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry about all this. You have his money, you said though, right? MARKUS: Yeah. WATTS: Well, what are you gonna do with it? You gonna hand it over to him after he tried to do you dirty with one of his guys? MARKUS: I don't know. WATTS: Does he know we were working on this together when he gave the job originally? MARKUS: No, he shouldn't. WATTS: Fucking Frank. I think I gave you a head's up about him a long time ago, if I can remember correctly. MARKUS: Yeah. WATTS: What about my portion of the cash? MARKUS: I got your money. WATTS: Good, when can we meet? MARKUS: Let's say half an hour. WATTS: All right, real good. I can do that. Where do you want to meet at? MARKUS: Sixth Street Bridge, same place we met there before. I'll drop your money. Then I got to go. I don't want people tailing me. All your money will be in there. WATTS: All right, sounds good. You let me know what you want to do with Frank later over the phone. Maybe I can help you out even though it's none of my fucking business, but let's meet there in about half an hour. Anything else? MARKUS: No. WATTS: All right, I'll see you there. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (PAPER RUSTLING) (BAG ZIPPING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN: Markus? MARKUS: Yeah, look, I'm gonna be leaving town for a while. I can't talk a lot about it right now. I'll talk to you in a few days. (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (METAL THUDDING) (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) FRANK: Hey, asshole, answer your phone. I think I have something you might want, your girl, Staci. Oh, and I picked up some of my money from your boy. Oh, don't worry. You won't find much left of him. Give me a call as soon as possible. You have something of mine, and I have something of yours. Call me so we can negotiate. Bye. (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (PHONE RINGING) Thanks for calling me back. Glad you listened to my message. We need to meet up, Markus, sort all this out. Where's my money? A safe place. FRANK: Staci's right here, man. She's fine and in good health, and I wanna keep it that way, as long as you do what I say. STACI: Markus, are you there? Things will be fine as long as you cooperate. I say we settle this once and for all. I don't want things to get out of hand. Meet me at Twins in and hour and a half. You be there with my money, I release the girl. See you then.

They're releasing Staci on Anderson and Boyd by the Fourth Street Bridge. I never said she'd be here with me. Now hand over the money.
