Michael Scott Kelvin, what are you doing? What the hell are you trying to do, kill us?! Christ. Beth and I were just playing, mom. Mikey, you promised you wouldn't do this again, didn't you? Beth wanted to see it. Tell her, Beth, tell her it was your idea. You stop trying to blame your sister. Look at me. You've ruined everything. You clean up this mess, right now. We'll deal with your punishment when your father gets home. Beth, come on. I hate you, you don't care about me! You're not my real mother! Why didn't you tell her you did it? Gimme back Alice, Mikey. She never punishes you. Never, ever! Give it, Mikey. Give it. - You're my sister. You should have been on my side! Gimme, you're not my real brother. Mommy, Mikey went outside without permission! Mommy! Gimme back! She's mine! Make me, Beth. Mikey, gimme back my doll! Get it. - Gimme back my doll, Mikey. - Come on, baby. Come and get it. Neener, neener, neener. Give it, Mikey. I bet you can't get it. Mikey, gimme back my doll! Come and get it. I hope your doll likes to swim. She's drowning, Beth. Stop it! Stop it. Stop it! Mikey! Help me! Mommy! Mommy! Help me. I shouldn't even be thinking this, but sometimes I think adopting him was a mistake. I mean, I just don't know what would... Jo? Joanna? These damn things. Michael, what have I told you about knocking? You don't love me anymore. Of course, I do. Your father and I love you very much. Then why do you always punish me? Look, we'll talk about this when your father gets home, okay? That just means I'm in trouble. Mikey, put that down. That's not funny. Daddy's on his way home. That's not a toy. - I know that. - Mikey, no! It's time for a little hide-and-seek. I'm home. Daddy's home! Hey, champ. What have you been doing all day? Nothing, just waiting for you. Where's your mom? She's upstairs taking a bath. Hey, you been playing baseball? No. Oh, my god! Mikey. See ya, champ. No. Can't believe this happened. Christ, this is terrible. Yeah. Poor Mikey. What's this world coming to? Collins, who's she? A neighbor. Hm. Is it pretty bad? Yeah. Well, let's go. This way. Looks like he saw his little girl in the pool and panicked. Yeah, but the window didn't do that to his head. Something like a two-by-four did. Grace Kelvin, age 32. Been fried. This is it, Collins? No. There's one more. What's your name, son? You see, I'm a detective. It's my job to catch the guy that did this to your family. Detective Reynolds. Miss harlig. Always a pleasure. You must be Mikey, right? Come here. Mikey, Mikey. Did you see anybody you didn't know hanging around? Now's not the time for this, Jake. You can do this later. Katherine, would you knock it off? He had bushy hair, a mustache, and a red jacket. Well, you did see him, then? I came home from the park. He was running outta my house, and he got in his car and drove away. Well, what did the car look like? It was big and brown. Is that all? Well, you know, you've been a big help. Thanks, sport. Reynolds, the corner's about done. They're dusting now, then they'll seal it off. You know, there was nothing stolen. We've got bodies separated so far apart. Well, what do you say? It's like the victims knew the killer. "I wanna go take a bath now. "You watch Beth for me." "Okay, mommy." "I'm home, everybody." "Daddy, daddy!" "Hey, champ, what you been up to?" "Waiting for you." "Where's your mom?" "In the bathtub." Oh, I'm wanna put these here. Who's that, Mikey? I don't know. A stranger. Have you seen him before? No, mommy doesn't know who he is. I have to go outside. Why do you have to go outside? I'm not supposed to see what happens. And what's that? He's gonna do something to my family, kill them. How do you feel about that man? I hate him. I hate him. I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I... I've just had my final session with Michael Kelvin. The boy's going through a great trauma, and there's still quite a bit of emotional scarring. Are you sure he's ready to leave? I believe so. I'd suggest you get him placed with adoptive parents as quickly as you can. Mikey just needs a good, stable home. I'm not a blood relative. Your his mother's sister. That kid was adopted. Are you positive? Michael hasn't said anything to any of us about being adopted. They took him away from his real parents. He was abused or something, I don't know. Gracie never really knew for sure. Kelsey, I know that the last few days have been very difficult for you, but you're all he has. You know that your sister would have wanted you... I'm not taking him. Not a chance. Why not? Look, you can't make me that that kid, can you? No, I can't. Good. Then kiss him goodbye for me. God, I hate airports. I hate coming here. No matter what time you leave, you're always late. Jesus, there's something wrong with this damn flash. Come on. - We're not gonna need the damn flash if we miss him. Son of a bitch. Oh, son of a bitch. There it is. You know, you're gonna have to start watching your language from now on. Yes, mother. There he is. Mikey, this is the Trentons. Are you my new mommy and daddy? - Goon. - Oh. Mikey, here's a present. Thanks, Mr. Trenton. It's great! You don't have to call me Mr. Trenton. What do you want me to call you? Um. You can start with Neil and Rachel. Okay, Rachel. There's my stuff. I was right, he's a ballplayer. So do you like to pitch? Yeah. But I'm a better hitter. We don't have a pool, but there is a lake. Cool. Swimming's one of my favorite things. This is it, Mikey. We're home. Wow! It's really neat! Welcome to your new home, chief. I think you're gonna be real happy here. We can go there all weekend. - Mm. - Here we are. - Hi. - Welcome! - Hey. - Hey. Mikey, this is Mrs. Owens. She lives next door. And this is Ben. Ben will be in your class at school. Sas 2 all right. I just know the two of you are gonna be best of friends. Mrs. Owens also has a daughter. Her name's Jessie. Come on, Mikey, you wanna see your room? - Yeah. - Ben can come too. Okay. - I'll take that. - Oh, thank you. Where's your sister? She had to go away to school. Oh. Wow, this is neat! This is Rachel's job. She creates these aquariums for people and then she makes sure they work right. She takes care of 'em. Maybe you can help me, Mikey. Cool. What's that? That's a mommy fish and her new babies. Why are they separated? Because this kind of fish eats its babies. - Really? - Gross. Can I take care of the baby fish? Sure. Hi, Rachel. Shawn, hi. Thanks. No problem. Mikey, I want you to meet my best friend Shawn. Hi. Guess what, miss gilder's a teacher. She teaches fourth grade. She gonna be my teacher? Yes, I am. But don't expect any favors just because I'm friends with your mom, okay? I love school. That's good. Mikey, you wanna see your room, or what? Well, how are you doing, mom? Seems like a good kid. - You think so? - Mm-hm. Well, you know more about kids than I do, that's for sure. Oh, god, I mean, this has all happened so fast. I haven't even had times to childproof the house yet. You are going to make a great mother. A great mother. Then why am I so nervous? Well, 1 think it's kinda natural, don't you? You and Neil have wanted a family for five years now. A baby, yes. But this child's been shuffled around so much. Yeah. He'll do okay. Just love him. You're right. Mm-hm. I mean, he's no different than any other kid. Did you brush your teeth? Mm-hm. Good, then it's time to hit the hay. Night, Mikey. Mom, dad, thanks. You're welcome. Okay, lights out, buddy. Can you believe what a great kid he is? I think we really lucked out. Yeah. So have you kept up on all your reading? Uh-huh. What do you think about that fourth stage of development in the loeffler book? Fascinating. Rachel, there is no fourth stage of development in the loeffler book. I don't need to read any book to tell me how to be a good mother. A little help couldn't hurt. You read too much, Trenton. Somebody's gotta do it. It's been a long time, Neil. It'll be better now. Which target am I shooting at? Now, we're gonna shoot some bad guys. Did you do this with your dad? Well, we didn't have the Indian guides, but I used to go out riding with him a lot. We did a lot of fun things together, just like you and I are going to. But what about the other kid? What other kid? The kid you had before me. Mikey, listen to me, there was no other kid. But what about all the stuff in my room? Rachel and I have wanted a child for a very long time. Why didn't you just have one? Because not everyone can have babies. We adopted you because we wanted you. And we both love you very much. I love you too. Dad, look, radical! Yeah, radical! You wanna give it a try? Yeah. Now, do it. Oh. Yeah! Whoa! Chief, you're a natural at this. Good morning. Happy Monday. = se hello. Go. He'll be fine. - Who's that? - You guys, settle down. - Hi, Mikey. - I'd like you to meet Mikey Trenton. Mikey just moved here. But, with our help, I'm sure he'll have no problem at all catching up, right? Right. Right. Okay. Why don't you give him a big welcome? Hi, Mikey. You should go sit down. - Hi. - All right. Does anybody have their arts and crafts project ready yet? - I do. - You do, huh? All right, let's see it. What is it? - I don't know. - This is wonderful. So what time is it, class? Marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time. When we do something special, miss gilder puts marbles in. When it's full, the door opens and we all get a prize. You get it, Mikey? Yes, miss gilder. I wonder what the prize is. Probably something dumb. I think she's neat. That's because she's a friend of your mom's. I love my mom. Hey, I know a shortcut. Through the cemetery? Yeah. You scared? No. You sure? Okay. Must be weird to have just one parent to love you. Huh? Both my parents love me. My mom loves me. So why don't you have a dad? He died. Did you see him die? No, he died in a hospital. Did you touch him? No! How'd your parents die? Why do you think my parents are dead? Well, you're adopted, so I just sort of figured. Well, they're not. Mikey? Mikey! Mikey, quit it! Mikey, come on. Mikey, where are you? Mikey?! Mikey? Mikey, what are you doing? Are you okay? You know, dead people aren't the ones to be scared of, living people are. That's very good. It's self-contained. I love it. You know, I read in this book, when a child draws water, it means he's adventurous and broad-minded. Not bad. Maybe we have another Christopher Columbus on our hands. What's a swimming girl mean? I was just looking that up. Here. A person swimming is symbolic of a desire for freedom, a feeling of being caged. Means the parents need to loosen their grip a bit. God. Are we being overbearing already? Come on, honey, don't make fun of it. This guy knows what he's talking about. Howdy. - Hi. - Hi, Mikey. I really, really like your drawing. Mm. Can I go ride my bike? Absolutely. Come home whenever you want to. Right, Neil? Sure. Whenever you want. Shh. Hear it? It's talking. Shut up. It's not funny anymore. Oh. Butch! Aw, no, Rosie! Butch, butch, come here! There you go. This converts electricity into visible light, kind of like a light bulb. The light bulb sends a current through a wire. This sends electricity between two wires. It's pretty cool, huh? Yeah! Okay, that's it. Make sure you read chapter three in your biology book. All right, later, guys. Don't forget, your movie reports are due Friday. See you bright and early tomorrow morning. Bye. Mikey? Can you come here for a minute? Everybody wants to win, but it really isn't worth it if you're just gonna cheat. The best way to get people to like you is to just be yourself. Yes, miss gilder. Yeah? You think you can try that? Okay. I'm not gonna tell your folks about this, okay? But you are. I'm gonna trust you on this. Okay. You can go. See you tomorrow. Woo! Woo! Excuse me, miss! You left this. For heaven's sake. Thank you, young man. Well, junior g-man, I think you've earned yourself a half dollar. No, that's okay, sir. This is quite a little gentleman you've raised here. Such an angel. Do you know, dear, he's got your eyes. Thank you. We're very proud of him. You should be. Bye-bye. Thanks. I'm glad I have your eyes. Mikey. You handled that very well, chief. Let's go see the snakes. You know, I had no idea there were so many styles and colors. Oh, god, you should see the stuff that walks into my class. I bet. I just want it to be right, you know? He's real special kid, and he needs some special attention. Well, he seems really interested in class. Mm-hm. Has he told you about the marble game? Marble game? Yeah. - He has? - Yeah. He says that he wants to do his homework really well so that everybody gets a prize. Hey, are you still thinking about getting a gun? Yeah. Great. I can't have this in the house. Oh, Rachel. Can't believe you're doing this. You're outta your mind. Now, I'm packing. - Let's go. I like the purple eyes. - Thanks. - It's a nice touch. And who's that, Sarah? That's my mommy cooking Thanksgiving dinner. She cook good? Yeah. What's your favorite part? Stuffing. What you got, Mikey, I bet it's an Indian. The pilgrim's bad, so the Turkey's fixing him. Larry bird takes a pass at the top of the key, hands it off to mchale, no, he keeps it, and he drives to the basket! Yeah, the champs. Oh, hi. I wanted you to see something. Uh-huh. Nice, it's a little weird, but... Who did it? You? Mikey Trenton. So? So you told us to come to you with any sign of a psychological problem. Yeah. So according to all the literature I've been reading, Mikey could be suffering from unattached syndrome. Unattached syndrome. I've never heard of it. It's psychotic behavior. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hope I'm not being rude, but how long have you been a teacher? Two years. And you're sure of what you're saying? No, I'm not sure, but I certainly think it's something to be wary of, don't you? Well, sodo I, but I don't think you should be an alarmist about it. Look, I was a nine-year-old kid once myself. I used to do drawings like this, but I'm not psychotic. I like monster movies, especially like Godzilla, you know, the one with the fire coming out of his mouth. So why encourage us to read this if you're not gonna take it seriously? I encourage you to read it, yes. I don't encourage you to take every word literally. So you're not gonna do anything about this? I'm not gonna do anything right now. I think it's a little premature. Guess experience knows, huh, champ? Mikey Trenton gets the sign, checks the runner, winds up, throws a fastball. Kelvin swings! Strike! Hits the batter on the head. Kelvin is down, blood is everywhere! The crowd roars, "yeah!" Mikey, come inside and wash up. Okay, mom. Hi, Eva. Hi, Shawn. Hope you're not looking for Mr. Jenkins. No, look, I need all the information you can give me on Mikey Trenton. Sure, but it won't say much. We don't have any of his past records. What do you mean? In a closed adoption, all records are sealed. There you go. Look, can't we unseal them? I doubt it. Besides, we don't even know where he came from. Okay, guys, come on in. - I'll race youl! - Okay, ready to play? - Yeah! - Good, okay, let's line up. Mike, start over there. Okay, guys, line up from Mike on. Come on, straight line now, remember? Come on. Straight line. S-t-r-a-i-g-h-t line. That's right, hey, hey, hey, look, pay attention here. See, straight line. That's it, listen to me. Here, Steve. Shirt. Skin. Shirt. Skin. Shirt. Skin. Shirt. Skin. - I'm a shirt! - Shirt. You're a skin, Trenton. I wanna be a shirt. Well, I said you're a skin. I'm not taking off my shirt. Look, what's the big deal? Take your shirt off, get some fun. I'm allergic to the sun. Oh, all right, then you're a shirt. Now, get outta here. Skin. Shirt. Skin. What? - Shirt. - What, shirt, good. - Skin. - Right, get outta here. Put your shirt over there! So tell me something, Mikey, how do you like your new home? I like it, thank you. Good, good. Mm-hm. They're the best part. They love me tons. Bet they do, you're a wonderful guy. Oh, I have both of those posters. Tell me something else, Mikey. What's your favorite movie? Freddy kruger, "nightmare on elm street." Oh, I'll bet. Real scary, huh? Is that why you don't like to take your shirt off? You wanna be like Freddy krueger? Sort of. Why else don't you wanna take your shirt off? It's nothing to do with my new mom and dad. No, no, of course not. My real mom and dad, they were bad. Oh, how were they bad? Is it real? Yeah, it's real. How old was he when he died? You know, I don't know. Probably not much older than you. How'd he die? Hello?! Jessie, help me, quick! - What? - My friend, hurry! He's not breathing! Hurry! - This is a joke, right? "Welcome home, Jessie," is that it? No joke, Jessie. What do we do? I bet he has a pulse. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, Ben, how long has he been like this?! I don't know! Do something! Jesus Christ! Had you fooled, didn't he? But he didn't have a pulse. It's a trick I learned on TV. You take a ball and put it under your arm, feels like you're dead. Neat, huh? Kinda. Who are you? I'm Mikey Trenton. Trentons don't have a kid. Now they do. Mikey's adopted. Oh. Well, you're a good kisser. Pretty kitty. I've missed you. I've missed you. Come on, guys. You can make it. Why are we doing this? We should be practicing. David, you're crazy. Get in there. Thanks, guys. So you want me to do anything else for you? That's okay, you guys go play. Come on. Come on. Come on. - See you soon, Jessie. Likewise, Mick. David! David. How did you get in here? Oh, I have my ways. So did you miss me? Mm, a little. The word is assassin. Assassin. A-s-s-a-s-s-i-n. - Ll-n. Yeah. - He got it. - You know what? That's absolutely correct. - Yeah! - Yay, I won again, just like before. Well, that's great. Where did you win before? That was good. In Oklahoma, I won for a whole city. Well, I'll bet you didn't have a surprise. What time is it, class? Marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time, marble time! So what do you think, class? You think it's gonna work this time? Yeah! Oh, yeah. Yeah! Now, I wonder what he's gonna get. Do you guys know what's he's gonna... Yeah! Cool! - All right. - Oh, yeah. Hey, pal, see what I won? I know you don't know much about time, but, for us, it's a big deal. But you don't have to worry about time, 'cause no matter what time it is, I'll be here to feed you. Miss levin? Yes, this is Mrs. levin. Hi, I'm Shawn gilder. - Hi. - I'm a teacher here in Arizona. I'm calling to inquire about a former student of yours. His name is Mikey Trenton, and he's in the fourth grade. Mikey Trenton, I don't remember a Trenton. Yeah, he had a different last name, but he won the spelling bee last year. Oh, my god, you must mean Michael Kelvin. Oh, poor boy. Why do you say that? You mean you haven't heard about the tragedy? No, I haven't. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know if I should say. Please tell me. It was his whole family, and... What happened to his family? They were murdered. We never found out how because the police are still looking for the killer, and... Going to the market. Got any requests? A six pack. Just kidding, mom. Bye, sweetie. Bye. Save you a twinkie. - Ho, ho. - I'm not buying you any of that junk. Hi, Jessie. Hey, Mick. Ben around? No. He went with mom to the store. You bored? Yeah, I know how it can suck being the new kid. Well, you can hang out here with me for a while if you want. Are you sure you don't mind? Tell you what, I was thinking about going for a boat ride. I could use a little muscle. Sure, I'm real strong. Only if you promise I'll be safe out there on the lake with you, 'cause after all, you're a pretty good kisser. Ready? Go. I'll race you. Jessie, why do you have to go away to school? Because I'm a woman with a past. I was a bad girl, Mick. I got kicked out of my school here. What did you do? Kill somebody? Oh, god. You kids do watch too many movies. Come on in! I don't have my suit on. So, Mick, do you like girls better than frogs yet? I don't like frogs. Nice evasive move. What? - Nothing. Mikey, you're staring at me. No, I'm not. Hey, it's okay to look. It may not be polite to stare, but looking's nothing to be embarrassed at. Just promise me one thing, when the girls you look at, they start to look back, make sure you're real nice to 'em, okay? If I had a girlfriend, I'd do anything for her. I bet you would. Oh, my god! The heck you watching? Just a horror film. Sorry, buddy. I don't feel good about you watching that kinda stuff. Besides, it's bedtime. So what kinda fun stuff did you do today? - Dad? - Yeah? How do you know you love a girl? I don't know. You just know. Makes you feel good all over. Is it like I feel with you and mom? Is there anyone in particular? No. Well, if there ever is, you just let me know. I'm always here for you. Okay, dad. Okay. Goodnight, Mikey. - Goodnight, dad. - I love you, boy. Love you too, dad. Aww. I know, aw. Tomorrow, I'll tell you a bedtime story. - Okay. - All right. What the hell?! Hey, come out here! Come on! David, forget it. I'm gonna kick some ass. David, leave Rosie alone! She scared the hell outta me. She's just a cat. David, come inside. So who's out here? Huh, Jess? Don't start that again. Wait, you're not gonna answer me? I don't know! Yeah, right. David, don't. I'm tired, I'd like to go to sleep. Oh, come on, baby. David, it's the wrong time. Jessie? Oh. Ben, go back to sleep. What happened? I don't know. But you better go back to sleep before mom comes home and catches you up. This will put you back in the mood. No, it won't. Okay, come on. We were doing so good. Come on. Sorry, you kinda killed it for tonight. Bye. Oh, god. I'm sorry, Jess. It was an accident. I mean, I didn't see her. Just leave, okay? If a man can excavate 10 cubic yards of earth in six hours, what can one man excavate in a day? Planet earth to Mikey. So what do you get? 40 cubic yards? That's very good. We're gonna do silent study now. Please turn to chapter three. And, Mikey, could you come here for a minute? And bring your book. Do you wanna show me what's so interesting in that book of yours? Come on, Mikey, give. It can't be that bad. What have you done? So based on this, you think Mikey has an emotional problem? Rachel, all we're suggesting is that maybe Mikey should see a child psychologist. Christ, I made a picture like this when I was kid. I know, I know, but, you know, we feel that Mikey may be, just may be, suffering from an emotional disorder called unattached syndrome. It's very common in adopted children. Don't you know anything about his history? I know Mikey. If anything, he's brighter than other kids. It's not a question of whether he's bright or not, Rachel. Most kids don't mutilate their own arms with thumbtacks. He did what? Self-mutilation is an expression of a child hey, wait a minute, I've read all the books too, okay? And I haven't seen a child crying out for help. This is such crap. He's a wonderful kid. He's perfect. Yeah, he's too perfect. There is no such thing. Yeah, Nell, there is, in children with psychotic tendencies. Psychotic, so now we have Ted Bundy, Jr., is that it? Look, Rachel, I know you're hating this, I'm hating this, but your son has a problem. Why are you doing this, Shawn? Because I'm trying to help. You just don't want me to be happy. Oh, that's ridiculous. Stop denying the situation. Enough. That's all. Let's go, Rachel. Rachel... No. Ah. Don't say it. We have to do something. They're too close to it. Did you see any tack marks on his arm? No. No! I can't believe that Shawn is doing this. Well, she thinks she's doing her job. Well, I don't want him around her, okay? I am going to pull him from her class. Come on, let's don't overreact. The agency said there was gonna be some emotional scarring. Hey, give it back! How would you like to be his parent? Where are my baby fish? Mr. michaelson bought them for his aquarium. But they were mine! Honey, they were all grown up. It was time for them to have their own home. But they were mine, you had no right to sell them. Mikey, what's wrong with you? They were mine, they were mine! Calm down. They were only fish. You don't care about how I feel. You don't love me. I hate you, I hate you! Calm down. Stop it. When daddy gets home, we'll talk about it. He's not my real daddy! You're not my real mother! I hate you, I hate it here! I wish I never met you! Mikey, wait! I'm sure there's an explanation. If we could just get him to talk. I don't know, maybe they're right. About what? Maybe we should take him to see a shrink. Look, honey, if we can just be patient, I think we can handle this. We both love Mikey, right? We're the ones that are gonna help him out. Mom! Mom! Mikey. I was looking for you. Honey, what are you doing? I have something for you. Mikey, you have to learn to knock. They're for being such a great mom. Why don't you take the flowers downstairs and put them in some water while I get out, okay? Mom? Hm? Mom, what if I... I'm getting cold. If I threw this in the bathtub, it would work just like an electric chair. You're right. Be a good boy and unplug it. This is so cool when they blast their way out. How do you know? 'Cause I've seen it three times. Hi, guys, how many dead? Oh, hi, Jessie. I know how much you miss your cat, so I got you a new one. Oh, thank you, Mick. David, I told you I don't wanna see you! Listen, just talk to me. Please? Will you please talk to me, please? Isn't that the guy who killed Rosie? Who's the twerp? He lives next door. Please, let me talk to you for five minutes. Please? Okay, let's talk outside. What? Flowers? David, you're kidding, right? Please. Please? I'm really, really miss seeing you. David, get off your knees. Please? Please, don't do this to me. David, you're pathetic. Where's your mom? She's at a friend's. Why? Just wondering. J one of these days j j I'm gonna do everything I say j j one of these days j hey, hey, hey. I thought we were gonna give him some space. He seemed really quiet tonight. Well, he's probably just tired. Well, I think we should try and talk to him. I think he'll talk when he's ready. Come on, mom. Don't worry. Come on. J gonna be a star j oh, please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Take me back, take me back! Hey! You're going in! - Whoa! J da da da da, shh, da, shh j woo! Oh, yeah. J one of these days j j one of these days j did you hear that? No. I think that might be mom. I better get it. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'll be right back. Hey, bring back some beers. Okay. Hello. - Mommy! - Hello? - Help me! - Hello? You're Ben's friend, right? You know, you shouldn't be out here, kid. You shouldn't be out here, either. Yeah? Why not? - Who is this? - That's not a toy. No! Is this some kind of a joke? You killed Rosie. That was an accident, okay? Life is full of accidents. What are you talking about? The radio, it's not safe. Why not? 'Cause you could die. David, you wouldn't... David! David?! David, I am in no mood for this kinda joke! David. David. David, if you don't come out right now, I'm going inside, and I'm locking all the doors, and I'm never speaking to you again! David! David! David? David! Look, lady, officially, this case is closed. That's understood. Now, the circumstantial evidence points to an inside job. The aunt's a nut, but she's clean. No one else will buy a nine-year-old doing all this. Hasn't he ever been checked out, psychologically? Yeah, they checked him out at social services, but he passes with a clean bill of health. Squeaky clean, beyond suspicion. I need to see those police reports. All right, you got a fax? Mm, at the school. Okay, in the morning, but before breakfast, 'cause it sure as hell ain't rated g. Wasena. Yes, he is, could you hold on a second? Mr. Jenkins, it's for you. Let me take it here. Hello? - Morning, Eva. - Morning. I'm expecting a fax. Nothing yet. Okay, thanks. Okay. Thanks very much for calling us. Yeah, appreciate it. Mikey Trenton and Ben Owens won't be in class today. - What's going on? - There was an accident at Ben's house last night. Is Ben all right? Yeah, Ben's all right, but his sister's boyfriend is dead. Oh, my god, that's terrible. What happened? I don't know, some bizarre accident. He was electrocuted in the jacuzzi. I've been doing some research into Mikey Trenton's background. I really need to talk to you about this. Yeah, okay. You go to your class, and I'll meet up with you later. - Okay. - Okay. Look, Eva, I'm gonna come back after my next class to check on that fax, all right? "Electric chair"? We were so stupid. Putting the radio so close to the edge, that was so stupid. He was probably just changing the station or something. I went in to answer the goddamn phone. Do you believe there was some pervert on the line? Glad you're not dead. God, I wish I was. Maybe it wasn't an accident. What? Maybe he was being punished. Punished? For what? He killed Rosie, didn't he? Mikey, that's sick. Thought you loved her. 1 did, but you can't love an animal the same way you love a person. I loved David. Now, he's dead. I'm not dead. No, you're not, Mikey. Now, you can love just me. Mikey, go home. Go home. "Now you can love just me." Rachel? Rachel! Rachel? Rachel? Jessie. Hi. Rachel. How are you feeling? I need to talk to you. Of course. Can I get you something? No, it's about Mikey. Yes? I'm not sure how to... Rachel, I think that there's something very wrong with Mikey. What do you mean? There's something very strange about him. God, I don't know how to explain it. At first, I thought it was just a crush, but I think that Mikey's in love with me. He's only nine years old. He's not normal nine-year-old, Rachel. Jessie, you're upset. You've had a huge shock. No, Rachel, would you listen to me, please? Mikey said stuff. What stuff? That David was being punished for killing Rosie and that now I could love only him. I think that he killed David. Jessie... Rachel, listen to Mel! Your son is dangerous! If there's something wrong with Mikey, Neil and I will deal with it. I know we have to talk with Mikey, decide what to do then. Don't worry, Jessie. Did you get my fax yet? Oh, yeah, it's right here. There you go. - Thanks. Electrocuted? Oh, my god. Dammit. Miss gilder. Miss gilder, where are you going? Mikey's first mother was electrocuted. What? Sound familiar? I see what you're getting at. Rachel doesn't understand how dangerous he is. My car is right here. David! Mikey? Mikey, are you all right? What are you doing? Watching "Mikey's funniest home videos." Oh, my god, Mikey, what have you done? Pretty funny, huh? You better go to your room. Mikey, put that down. It's not a toy. That's what you say. Mikey, give me the hammer. Okay. No. Damn. Mikey? Mikey? Mikey! Nol! Now, Shawn, I know Rachel's a friend of yours, but please watch what you say. My god, Mikey! No more! No! No! Mikey, it's over! Mikey, please. No! No! No! Hurry. Just open it. Rachel?! Oh, no. Oh, god. Don't. Go on outside. Go on. What the hell? Hey, what are you doing with that? Give me that, you'll shoot yourself. We could have stopped this. Maybe you're right. We should have stopped this. I owed her. Hey, hey. Take it easy, now. Listen, I gotta go in and call the police. You'll be all right? Hm? - Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Come on. Oh, Jesus. Mr. Jenkins. Mikey. Put that down, Mikey. Put it down. God help me. Mikey. Shawn. I guess you were looking for these. Here you go. You know, miss gilder, I think your marble game is, like, the best. You know what? This is my lucky marble. What do you want, Mikey? I wanna thank you, miss gilder. You were the best teacher I ever had. I learned a lot. But would you teach me one more thing? What? How to die. Hello? Trenton residence. Mikey speaking. Hey, Mikey Trenton. What's up? Oh, where are you? I had a late meeting, but I'm on my way. Listen, is your mom there? Can I speak to her? She's not feeling very good. Not feeling very well. Okay, never mind. I'll see you in a bit, boy. I'll be waiting. Mikey, what do you want? - Where's Ben? - He's not home. Canl come in? No! But... Mikey, Mikey, what the hell are you doing? Why don't you like me anymore? Mikey, I want you to go home. But I like it here with you. How did you get in here? My secret way. Well, this time you're gonna use the door. - But... - Mikey, go home! But... I'm gonna get you, you little shit! No. Mikey, no! Hi, chief. What you been up to? Nothing, just waiting for you. That's nice. Neil! Neil! Hi. She sure is pretty. Sure is, dad. So did you have a good day? Yeah. Got a lot accomplished. That's great. I'm real proud of you, both of us are. And we're both real happy that you like it here with us. Dad, will you always love me? Always, Mikey. Thanks, dad. Neil! Don't need that. Something for your mom. Bills, bills, bills. Ooh, look at this. Can you read that? You won. Maybe we did. Come here, I have a surprise for you. A surprise? - Yeah. - Where? Come on. Where is it? Come on. What? Go. Go, go. Rachel? Rachel. Rachel? No! We suspect a gas leak. Discovered four adult bodies in the debris. We assume two were the residents. We don't know about the other two. Ma'am. Do you have any idea who they might be? No, I don't. I see. What about Mikey? I saw him go in there. Well, we did find the skeletal remains of what appears to be a 10-year-old child. Are you sure? I'm very sorry. You're sure? When we found the boy out on route 240, he had a bad case of amnesia, didn't even remember his name. When we finally gave up trying to locate where he came from, we called him Josh. Josh, that's a nice name. Josh doesn't remember too much about his past, but our staff psychologist thinks he's gonna be just fine. What he needs most is to feel that he belongs. Well, we've been praying for a child for a very long time. You're gonna have to be very patient with him in the beginning. It won't be easy. God will show us the way. Well, remember, your love is the best chance Josh has for a new and healthy life. Josh, you can come in now. Are you gonna be my new mommy and daddy?
