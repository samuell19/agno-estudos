TOEl MOVIE CO., LTD. Presents Help! He got two of our men. You came here to tell me that? No. Good. A Himuro survivor maybe? Himuro? There's no Himuro left with that kind of guts. Is there, Yano? No. Light. What's your point? Eguchi of the Koyu-kai may have hired a hit man. I see. Maybe. Those punks are getting too big for their britches. We've been watching them gather soldiers and arms. That's what happens when you just shoo off flies. We'll swat them. Do it quickly and efficiently without bothering the cops. Yes, sir. Hello, sir. Old man Himuro was a fool to think he could defy the godfather and make it in this town. He was behind the times. And you weren't? Who ever dies over duty and honor anymore? Bet the old man never expected to see an amusement center go up where Himuro headquarters used to be. Hey, Asami! Asami? Asami?! It's you, Junior. Good to see you. Long time no see. HIMURO HEADQUARTERS It's an Onuma gang raid! A raid! No! Let me go! Dad! Dad! Kyoko! Kyoko! I didn't like my dad. I wanted to make it on my own. So I left my dad and went to Okinawa for five years. But I won't let my dad's killer get away with it. This is where my room used to be. I'm sorry for what happened to your dad. I was with a woman and not there for him. I've been waiting till this day for a payback. It's pointless. What are you doing now? Making a living stevedoring. We put you through so much. No, sir! Got a wife? Yes, and a kid. Oh? Take good care of them. Yes and you take care, too, Junior. - Yano. - Yes? YAKUZA WOLF Cast Shinichi Chiba Ryoji Hayama Koji Nanbara Kazauko Mayama Rokko Toura Tonpei Hidari Hideo Murata Hirohisa Nakata Koji Hio Yayoi Watanabe Rumi Goto Makoto Sato Director: Ryuichi Takamori ONUMA COMMERCE, LTD. Well, bro. Let's go. Take me to Onuma's digs. Are you the Koyu-kai hitman? I told you the boss is laying low awhile. Who knows if he's even there. So it is Himuro's son. Long time no see. I figured you were back. Sniffing around garbage cans, as usual? I've taken a liking to the stink of garbage. Your old man ended up like garbage. My condolences. Don't want any condolences from a cop? I arrested the killer. The patsy, you mean. You out to get the big fish who put him up to it? Avenging your old man is bold. But it's just like you. Have you seen your sister? Is Kyoko alive? Where is she? I don't know. I'm not in missing persons. I don't get points for them. I have a wife and two kids to feed. She was a nice one, so Onuma must have had her, then turned her into a call girl, geisha, or sex worker. You have dope on her. Come on. You know that's how it goes. I'm a cop. I'd tell you if I had any dope. You know that's where the money is for them. Hope you see your sister. My hunch is right. He's the one that got those Onuma men. Why not arrest him? No evidence. Let him walk for now. The Onuma don't suspect him. They suspect a rival gang, Koyu-kai. Let the vermins wipe each other out and spare us the trouble. No, I'm going home. Let go of me! Quiet, you bitch! We didn't get you those drinks for nothing! Bitch! Come on. Hurry! Someone help me! Help me! No, stop! Nice body. Strip her. You stand watch. Make it quick. Make it quick. Look at my hard-on, bro. I'm ready to blow. Zip it up, you jerk. Your turn, Hachi. Here goes. I go first, you jerk! You came, bro? All done? Shoo! My turn now. Oh, no, I... came. Let's go. Come on, baby. Forget something? You wear it. Thank you. Got me a souvenir. All we can drink, on the boss. Had a nice one, did you? I really got my rocks off. Did you really? Did I ever. Shot after shot. I have to get me some. No woman will go for that face. A raccoon dog, maybe. Take a look at that face. What a mug you have. Whose mug are you looking at? Just kidding. No hooker's going to fall for you. That's cold. Scotch. Scotch. Who did her first? - I did her last. - I know that. You? I was second. I said scotch. - Bastard! - Hold it! Ishiguro. Don't bother. And let this bastard diss us? Get funny, you bastard! Here you are. I said scotch. It's on that gentleman. You drink it. I will then. Thank you. There you are. You drink it. I will then. Will that be all for you gentlemen? I'll put it on the boss' tab. What are you after? I want a woman. Those guys had a lively one. I want to buy her before they break her. Forget it. I'm not talking to you. The Koyu-kai couldn't have hired you. What's with you and the Koyu-kai? Are you Onuma's muscle, or a hired hand of his? In any case, another mangy mutt. I'm beginning to suspect you made those hits. Mangy mutts have good noses, and a scent. Like you do. You take care. I'll try. Care for a drink? You scare me. You're out to wreck a woman's body. Why are you so intense? Are you getting back at a woman for taking you? No one's taken me. But you're getting back at someone. I can tell. You're just like the man that left me. He made me a woman. But he got himself killed in someone else's place. The day before, he made wild love to me as he cried, "I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it! "I'm going to be a man about it!" I thought I was going to die. When I heard he was killed, I felt relief for him. I envied him. Want a smoke? I'm happy now, sleeping with men and making money. Don't get so serious or you'll go crazy. How many of you are there? Who cares? Are there other joints like that one? What do you want to know? Are you a cop? Guess not. Your eyes are too clear to be a cop's. You have the eyes of a hit man. Oh, no. I think I'm falling in love with you. You remind me of my past. I had a dad, a mom and a sibling once. How silly. Want to shower? KYOKO HIMURO Brother! You startled me. Where did you get this? It's just a trinket. Why don't you shower? It's refreshing. Where did you get it? So you are looking for a woman. Your first love? Where did you get it? It was collateral for a loan. Whose? An Onuma punk. What's his name? I didn't do anything! Owww. Where did you get that pendant Saeko had? Tell me, or I'll strangle you to death. I'll tell you, so don't kill me! I got it from my bro, Shimizu. Shimizu? Do you know where he got it? No... I do, I do! Let me go. When the boss had himself a virgin, he got that, too. Really. What happened to the girl? I don't know. Really. I'm an honest yakuza. If you want to live a long time, don't tell anyone about me. I hear you. Give me doburoku rice wine. Napoleon Premium. Where's that Napoleon Premium? Napoleon Premium nothing. You guys know this is Koyu-kai turf? Sure do. We're here to get even for some family you guys did in. What? You mess with us and you're going to get it. You're the ones that are going to get it from us, you jerks! Take that, you bastard! Beat it. - What's going on? - Wait, bro. - Shut up! - Bastards! Seishin-kai is sending over soldiers, bro. Go now and you'll walk into an Onuma trap. We can't just back down, you fool! Koyu-kai isn't a bunch of sorry losers! Don't go now. Koyu-kai belongs to all of us. Don't you get it? We can't let the Onuma take over our turf. It's time for a showdown. If the Seishin-kai show up, we'll deal with them and slaughter every one of them. Are you guys with me or not? Will you put your life on the line for Koyu-kai? It's a raid! A raid! Put away your arms. Come out! Are you Eguchi? Who are you? Are you making a raid or what? What? Are you going to do in the Onuma or what? They got one of you men. You'll lose face unless you do them in! You jerk! Why, you! I have no beef with you. I'm not your enemy. The Onuma are. Do you know where their roost is now? Don't tell me you're that clueless. They think you got one of them and are riled. You better settle it with them before they get more of you. What did you come here for? To warn you against making a raid on an empty roost. Who are you? Knowing my name won't get you more turf. Bastard! You guys can take the Onuma. Beat up the Onuma! Hold it! You bastards! Hold it! Are you with Koyu-kai? - Boss! - Bro! What happened? - Boss! - The Onuma got him. The Onuma? Over there. Those bastards! Hang on! Sabu! Hang on, Sabu! Sabu! Those bastards. - We're going in! - Come on! So there you are, Onuma. Bro! - Let's go! - OK! Hold it! Hey! You saved us. Thank God. I wouldn't be so sure about that. What's the idea? I'm selling you two out to Onuma. What? You'll serve as bait to lure him out. Mess up and I'll kill you. Stop. I brought the money. Hand over those two. Go on. Get him, Ishiguro! Well, shoot, you boozing alky bastard! You didn't hire me. Why, you! Don't shoot! Is it money? I'll give you all you want! I don't want money. I want your life. Who are you?! I'm Himuro. Himuro? Spare me! Don't shoot me! Spare me. I'll spare you if you tell me where my sister is. I don't know. My men did her. It's the truth! Forgive me! Truth is, I raped her. Forgive me. I'm sorry! Help! Let me go! Help! Help! Let me go! No, stop! No! No, no! No! Then what? I turned her over to Boss Izumi. Where is she now? I don't know. I really don't. Probably at a secret club. Secret club? I really don't know. Spare me. Spare me! Fine. You can go. A befitting death for a wretch, like mine will be. Figured you'd be here. You used to fish with your old man here. Just his luck, someone put him out before we could nab him. Are you going to nab me? Time to haul you in as a suspect in Onuma's murder. The Onuma are finished. So is Koyu-kai, with just Eguchi left. Meaning we can move on to other cases. Gosuke Himuro, your date of birth? Your date of birth? You got what you wanted. You can't complain. How about a deal? Got a make on that secret club Izumi has going? Wrong jurisdiction. Release me. Release you? It was all I could do to let you walk till now. Don't you want points? I'll let you nab me when I've done what I have to. You want to see your sister? It has nothing to do with you cops. Don't want to get nabbed till you save your sister? What a loving brother. Just before you get Izumi, you mean? Dream on. They'll slaughter you before you get to him. What about that deal? I can't let you walk. We'll get Izumi eventually in a nationwide manhunt. It's all over for him. I'm talking about a deal. He means I'll score more points arresting Izumi's killer than Onuma's. That makes sense. The police have more than enough to do. Why add to the load? I do have some dope. I'll do things my way. He was out to get Izumi from the start. Vermin have their uses. How long are you going to let that punk go? I'm sorry, sir. What's Ishiguro doing? I'm not paying him for nothing. I'll put him to work. Well, get to it. Who gets Onuma's turf, Sir? You can't just leave it. I'm going, Papa. Come right back now. Sir. Don't you ever bring up turf to me. It's just his daughter. I could send Izumi to hell with a single shot. Forget about it. You! It's no use. Izumi's on guard, and he'll lay low for a while. Shut up or I'll kill you! Don't move or I'll kill you, and I mean it. I have a job to do and I need Izumi alive. Are you telling me to back off? So we understand each other. I haven't forgotten how you took out Onuma and Hoshino. I'm not senile. I'll do things my way. Find something? Figured I'd see you. Figured you'd come here. Nothing of interest to you here, like a matchbook from that secret club you're looking for. No such luck. Do you know where it is? Show me there. - No way. - I'll pay you. Not nearly enough. Forget about getting Izumi. Settle for Onuma. I don't want to see you die a wretch. You could still have the good life. You won't tell me where he is? I'm not about to throw away a good gig. Money, women, gambling. You could do quite well for yourself providing your services. Why throw away your life for family? Your sister will never be the sister you remember. What can you do? Nothing. You forget something. Move aside. I'm on Izumi's payroll. I have to earn my keep. You do what you have to. You're a fool. Why do you want to die? What's worth dying for? You fool! What can you do? Nothing! You fool! Don't say anything! Don't say anything! I love you. I love you... I love you, I love you! I feel so stupid. I'm not like that. I don't know myself anymore. I feel like such an ass. What do you like to eat? I like konjak mixed with tofu. What is it called? My mom use to make it for me. Know what it's called? I'll try making it. The hills where I used to chase rabbits The stream where I used to fish... I used to fight a lot with my bratty brother. I only know how to make fried eggs. I always have instant ramen. Everything's instant nowadays. So convenient. That dead ex of mine used to love fried eggs and I had to make it for him. Oops, I burnt it. I'll eat this one. He insisted on butter and not oil for frying. Does it matter to you which? What do you want to drink? Brandy? You ordered scotch at the bar the other day. Throw my robe on and come out. Must you go? Don't go! If you go, I'll go back to what I used to be. Give this back to your sister. And here's a map to the secret club from Ishiguro. From Ishiguro? I hope you die. Kyoko. It's me, your brother. Will you sleep with me? Hey. Where are you going with that woman? Hold it. It's me, Kyoko. Gosuke. Don't you recognize me? Kyoko. Make love to me. That hurt. Thanks. Now go. What happened? She's naked. She's so young, the poor thing. Maybe she's weird in the head. She must be high on drugs or something. Who knows what girls are into nowadays. She isn't right in the head. Girls nowadays. That was all I could do for her. Brother. Call me then. - See you. - Bye! So there you are. Hello, Miss. Please. Go home if you can. You mangy mutt, still following me around? Fire that thing, and the police will be here with their shields. They'll blow you full of holes, too. Things won't always go your way. I told you I don't have a beef with you. Enough! Your hostage is getting away. We both need that girl till we get Izumi. Shut up, I'll have nothing to do with you. Your right hand's useless. Don't think Izumi will go down easy like Onuma. Don't make me laugh. I'll get Izumi. What can you do with your hand like that? Beg for my help on your hands and knees? Go on, do it! What makes you think I'll join hands with you? Now do it! You fools! You were right there with her. A chopped finger isn't going to do it. Sorry, Boss. Was it that Eguchi punk? Yes, sir. What about the guy that took the Himuro girl? We don't have a make on that guy. He's a Himuro... ...and he's after me. He won't lay a finger on you, Boss. You idiot! They get your daughter back or they're dead, Boss. Got that? Yes? What? This is Izumi. Your daughter's fine. You'll get her back at one, tomorrow afternoon. Pull any stunts and she's dead. The place? That dirt field you bought up. Izumi! Step up, alone, if you want your daughter alive. All right. You let me see her. Papa. Now step up! I'll make a deal with you, Eguchi. You can have Onuma's turf, all of it. So let my daughter down. Shut up. You want me to blow her away? Step up! Damn! The rest of you hold your fire. Bastard! Get him. Why didn't you shoot? Some pro I turned out to be. Izumi's getting away. You're one lucky guy. Idiot. Hold it. Who are you? Gosuke Himuro. Himuro's son? Your hands are useless. THE END
