School is over! I'm off the trouble! I don't give a damn. Tommy! Get back here! Come over! Stand. - Goodbye, ma'am. - Goodbye, ma'am. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Serves you right. - Keep it up. Tommy! Get back here! - You know what to do! - Yes. School is over! I'm off the trouble! I don't give a damn. One. School is over! I'm off the trouble! I don't give a damn. Two. Seven. School is over! I'm off the trouble! I don't give a damn. What are you looking at, Bucktooth? You need to pay to watch this. - School is over! - School is over! - Let's go. - Let's go. Sixty-seven. Tommy, come back here! It's all your fault! Sorry! School is over! I'm off the trouble! I don't give a damn. Why are you not leaving yet? Sixty-eight. Mr. Chan, you're here to pick your son? - He's in detention again! - Yes! - What would you like to drink? - No, thanks. School is over! I'm off the trouble! I don't give a damn. One hundred. It's over! Bye! Tommy, why did you dirty my face? Tell me. I want to. What can you do? I just want to drive you mad, Bucktooth! You have no manners at all. I wonder how your dad educates you. Maisy! Tommy! - Mom! - Mom! Hey, Dad. Dad! - Dad. - Maisy. Mom! Is Tommy a good boy? - Of course Tommy is a good boy. - Really? Dad, remember to put on a blanket for Tommy at night. Also, you must take care of yourself. I will. Thanks, Dad! Mom, you must be strong. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Mom! - Bye. Bye! Maisy, are you sleepy? No. Mom, we've been separated with Dad for over a year. Are we going to go on like this? Yes. Then I can't be with Dad and Tommy ever again? No, you see them once a week. Mom, I don't mean that. Drop the topic then. Open it up There's a tortoise Quickly get it -Hit it and let it faint -Get changed and take a bath. -I'll hit it and let it faint -Stop singing! Again? I took one the day before yesterday! It's so annoying. What a nuisance! Taking shower too often is not good for your body. Do you want to go to the zoo? You should have said that earlier! You know I love to shower. A little bird fell into the water A little bird fell into the water And so it bathes A little bird fell into the water The water is not hot nor cold. How can I shower? I'm done! - Finished? - Hey! You little brat! Dad, go get the door! You'll get it from me later. - Come in. - All right. - You look great today! - Really? Take a look around. It's my son's toy. Did it scare you? No. I accidentally... No, it was my son. No, not that either. Have a seat. I'll get changed. I'm out! I don't give a damn! You really are something, Dad. Another new girlfriend? A different girl every day! If you talk nonsense, I'll beat you up. I'm scared. Ma'am! Ma'am, Dad is asking for you. Me? Come on. Hurry. Hurry. Dad! You little brat. I'm sorry. He's really naughty. No, he's a lot of fun. Fun? Hey, don't hit him! I'll shout and he'll come right out. Open the door! Come out! Nothing will get me out! Open the door! Are you coming out or not? Unless you put down the cane. Else, I'll tell her about the other girl, the tuition teacher. What girl? There will be one if I make it up! Tommy, come out! Tommy. Listen to me and come out! I will when I see the cane. You won't see it if you don't open the door. Dad knows what to do. Go to your room. I want to talk to you. You must not mess around with her. Got it? She's very decent. Be good. Don't play tricks on her. I don't like her. You don't like any of them. I have to find a new mom to look after you, don't I? I don't want! - You say that when you get a new girl. - You... Help! Help! - What is it, Tommy? - I'm just playing with him. Greet Linda. Shake hands. Good boy. You play with her. I'll shut the windows. What is it? Nothing. I accidentally got it on myself. Let me clean it for you. Don't take that bag. Dad! Otherwise, you stay at home with Bobby. Let's go. Pretty lady. Sure. Take it. Take a few more! That's great! Nancy's Interior Design Company. She just came back. Hold on. Nancy, it's Mr. Chan from the accounting office. What else? George called 15 minutes ago. - What did he say? - He is on his way. Answer Mr. Chan's call. He's on line one. Hello, Mr. Chan? I told you, I'm not telling you to evade tax. I said that it's not taxable. I should keep the money to myself. Why should I benefit the government? That's all. Maisy, I have a present for you. Why? You got an A for composition. What did you write about? The person I dislike most. - Who is it? - Nancy, George is here. Him. Nancy. Greet George. George. Good girl. Your mom said you got an A for your composition. Here's a present for you. What was your composition about? The person... I like most. - Who is it? - It's Mom. Excuse me, George. I have something to say to my mom. Mom, come over here. Come. Mom, are you really going out with him? Why do you ask? - I'm worried he'll cheat on you! - Silly girl. He's just a business partner. That's what you think. He gives me a present as soon as he sees me. - He's got other things in mind. - Don't be so suspicious. Mom. Mom, I'm still worried. How about you take me with you? It's not convenient for you to come. I asked Grandpa to accompany you. Boastful Grandpa. How can you say that about Grandpa? He admits it! He isn't boastful. He's just a bit exaggerated. Come. The same moonlight, the same days Good day, Alex. - Not today! - Why? I ran into four punks in the elevator just now. They called me an old ape. I got mad and beat them up. One, two, three. All four of them got knocked out flat. Alex, you hit three times. How did you knock out four of them? Good question. I knocked three of them down. The fourth got so scared, he fainted. - I should go and take a look. - No need. They've left. - Why are you fine then? - Of course I'm fine. I have magic charms. I'll give you two. Which body parts do you think will get attacked easily? Just put the charms on and you'll be safe. Here. Let me help you. I'll get you one of these days. Grandpa, hello. Hi, what's your name? Dad, he's my friend. - Friend? - My name is George. Pleased to meet you. I'm Alexander. Just call me Alex. - Are you after my daughter? - Dad! We'll head out first. You eat with Nancy. - See you again. - Off you go! Mom, remember to be home by 11 p.m. tonight! Bye! Bye. He ran off at the sight of me. Is he after your mom? I'm worried Mom will be cheated by him. Don't worry about that. It's in our blood to cheat others, not the other way round. You said Mom was cheated by Dad and had us. That was an accident. But your dad is pretty good in coaxing girls. Let's go for a drink. - For three? - Yes. This way, please. Thank you. - Two steaks! - All right. Cheers. Just eat. My goodness. Linda. Do models have a better fashion sense? - I just dressed simply. - No. You look great today. - I look better in a swimsuit. - Really? - Come over and I'll take photos for you. - All right. My dad always invites the girls back to take photos. Hey, don't interrupt when the adults are talking. Okay. Dad, I dropped my knife. - Pick it up yourself. - Okay. Cheung. Tommy doesn't seem to like me. No, he behaves like that with everyone. You know the kids. He's just naughty. - Try the steak. It's tender. - Sure. Hey, that trick again. Do you have a death wish? Kids are cute when they are naughty. Let him be. Tommy, you! The ketchup is all over the body Let me clean it for you. Like a tortoise No need. I'll go to the washroom. I'm sorry, Linda! Let me remove it for you. - No need. - Linda! Brat, you've got nothing better to do. Always playing tricks! You've got nothing better to say too. Always saying that they look great. Keep running. Get over here! If you want to hit me, you come over. Why should I get over there? All right. I won't cane you tonight. I'll reason with you. Really? Sit down. I can't sit. Take those books out. You can sit then. Dad is so smart. Here. Let me ask you. What have I done wrong? Why do you always play tricks on my female friends? It's because I don't like them. That tea is a week old. Don't drink it. I'm doing this because I want to find a new mom to look after you, silly. That's not true. I always hear Peter saying at school that his new stepmom keeps beating him up. If I don't teach her a lesson right from the start, I'll be screwed. Dad, I really don't want a new mom. DELIVERY Grandpa, can you hear me? I heard you. Maisy, did Grandpa buy you a new toy? No, Tommy gave it to me. Tommy? I thought he always plays tricks on you. Not anymore. We're good now. Really? That's good. He's a good boy now. I'll let him come over this weekend. Mom, are you going to pick him up? Silly girl. Of course Grandpa is going to pick him up. Maisy, be a good girl. Go and play with Grandpa. Grandpa, did you see that? Mom is going to leave. Your mom is smart. No one can cheat her. Don't worry. She was late by half an hour last time. It's really dangerous! - What do you want? - Let me go with them. All right. I have an idea. Let me answer the door. Let me comb my hair and get changed. Are you after my daughter again? Do you think of me as your own family? Of course. Both of us are men. Let's be frank. How's your sex life lately? - Take a seat. - All right. Have you hooked up with a whore before? To put it in a nicer way, have you slept with a prostitute before? Never. Absolutely not! You're not very honest. How do I entrust my daughter to you then? Yes, I've hooked up with a prostitute before. What? You really did? You look so decent. I never thought you would do that. I don't go for that sort of thing. I just met a girl. She's pretty. Her figure is just like Marilyn Monroe's. And she has a beautiful face and a voice like Olivia Newton-John. Look at my age. I still got to know such a pretty lady. Tell me. Should I miss this opportunity? Of course not. I asked her over tonight. Please take Maisy along with you. Don't hesitate. Or you'll never be my son-in-law. - I don't mean that. - So it's okay then? Maisy, quickly get changed. George is taking you out. I've changed. Smart girl. What? We're taking Maisy along to the movies? Yes, George said he's in a good mood tonight. He wants to get to know Maisy better. My Marilyn Monroe is coming. Quickly leave. Nancy, we should get going. - Let's go. - Go on. - I took care of him. Keep an eye on him. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Hi, pretty lady. Grandpa is waiting for you. Go right in. All right. Bye. Marilyn Monroe? I'm collecting the maintenance fees. Thank you. Dad, do you have an eye for arts? - You arrange it then. - Me? I might as well take the photos too. Answer the door. Who is it? Robbers! Don't open the door! You played tricks again. I was just setting up inside. Let me take it for you. Hi, pretty lady. You look really pretty today! There's nothing. Look. There's nothing. It's not real. He was just playing with you. I'm all set. Go and get changed. But I can't smile now. That's even better. We'll call today's shoot The Furious Eve. Get ready. The Furious Eve. Be furious. Hold the apple higher. That's right. All right. Lower. Tommy, what are you doing? It's my apple. You said it's for me. Seriously. This is the same. Get ready. Be furious. More. Yes. The more, the better. Yes, almost there. That's it! Hey, get out. Hold the apple higher. Turn your face here. Good. That's it. Turn a bit more. That's right. You keep causing trouble. - Dad! - Get out! Dad! Dad, I want to eat ice cream! - Do you still want it? - No! Sorry. That's furious enough. Keep it up. Good. - Grandpa! - Tommy. Grandpa is here to bring you to see your mom. - Not yet. - Why? There's a show going on inside. You're so heavy. I'll put you down. What's there to see? A naked woman. Take a look. Really? Don't be too loud and disturb Dad. He's making a pass at her. So exciting? - Grandpa, hurry up. - Hurry. Are they inside? That's it! Are you going to keep knocking? Fortunately, I've practiced martial arts for years. If not... Wing Cheung, are you trying to get me killed? You know I have heart disease. Why are you trying to get me excited? Sorry. Linda, why don't you get changed? Wait. Hold on! I'm Alexander. You can call me Alex. What about you? Your hands are so smooth. She's Linda. Let go of her hands. I'll put on my clothes first. I don't want you to. It's very dangerous for you to be like this. Perverts will molest you if they see you. I'll give you two charms. I'll put them on for you. Move your hands. There you go again! My Filipino maid left because you scared her like that. - Linda, get changed. - Okay. She's good. Seriously. The lady came into the men's room! Is there a men's and a ladies' here? There's only one washroom here. There's a boy here. That makes it the men's room. Get changed in my dad's room. There's no one in there. - Dad. - What is it? Linda asked you to go in the room. She wants to talk to you. Grandpa, we need to leave quickly. Let's go. Sorry. Grandpa, let's go. Come on! - Grandpa, hurry. - All right. - Hurry. - All right. - What is it? - Nothing. I tricked Dad to peep on Linda when she was changing. You'll put your dad in an embarrassing situation. If you need to pull such a trick next time, let me know first and I'll see if it's doable. I got it. Let's go. Remember to behave when you see your mom later. Remember to greet her. - Try saying "Mom". - Mom! Who greets like that? Where's the emotion? Mom! I can't stand you! We're getting off here. I'll give you money to buy some flowers for your mom. Tell her you broke your piggy bank to buy it for her. Grandpa, that's not good. My teacher said that good kids don't lie. Unless you're the one who tells the lies. It has nothing to do with me then. Grandpa. - Why don't we give her chocolates instead? - Why? Mom will surely give them to us then. Little brat, let's go. Here. - Greet your mom. - Mom! Tommy! Mom, this is for you. Where did you get the money to buy it? Grandpa, you tell. He broke his piggy bank to buy it for you. He said it. What is it? Chocolates! Chocolates? You keep them for yourself. - But don't eat too much. - Okay. - Little brat. - Tommy! Is my dress pretty? It's pretty! Where did you get it? I'll ask Dad to get me one. Tommy, this is yours. Thank you, Mom! Here. It's pretty. If Dad sees me in this when I get home, he'll surely say that I look cool. That means you want to get changed now, right? Mom, why are you so smart? Spare me the compliments. How's Dad recently? He's a real pervert recently. He's seeing a very pretty girl. Really? Who is it? Dad's new girlfriend. Her name is Linda. Mom, are you jealous? Don't worry. She's not as pretty as you. She's really ugly and she has no taste at all. No. She's good. She's pretty and has a nice figure. I'm interested too when I see her. Do she and Dad make a perfect couple? Yes, they make a perfect couple. No. I still think that Mom suits Dad the most. Right, Mom? - What does she do? - She's a model. Mom, does one have to be pretty and have a nice figure to be a model? Of course. Otherwise, why would Grandpa be staring at her? Then is she as gentle as Mom? Your mom isn't gentle. She's very fierce and always bullies your dad. She made your dad lose his dignity. No! Mom is just playing with Dad. Actually, Mom loves Dad very much, right? Is she good to you? No. She always tries to befriend me. I don't know what she's up to. Of course she wants to be your new mom. Right? What? Then I'm finished for the rest of my life! Tommy. It must be mom's boyfriend. - He's a real pervert. - Really? He'll be screwed. Nancy. Thank you. You must be Tommy. Hello. - Hello. - You're such a good boy. Got you! What should I do? The glue... What should I do? The glue. - What's the matter? - Nothing. It must be you, Tommy. Don't run. Where's the cane? It's not his fault. It was me. He's so naughty. He has no manners at all. Let's go out. Bye. Nobody other than my dad can touch my mom! I can't open the door. Thank you. - Iced tea. - Coffee. My mom wrote to me to rush me again. What is it about? To get married sooner. I'm over 30 years old already. I'm the only son too. She wants me to settle down and return. Let's talk about it later. You should think about your children too. I've got school arranged for Tommy and Maisy. Let me think about it. Here. Do you remember what to say to Dad? - Yes. - Yes. Smart kids. - Dad! - Maisy! Tommy! Maisy, you've put on weight. You're becoming fat. - Is your pretty model here? - She has left. I won't go in then. I'm going to enjoy myself. Take Maisy home later. - Bye. - Bye. Come in. I bought a lot of things for you to eat. I'm making pork chop too. There are games after dinner. Look at the family dining set. Cool, isn't it? - I'll press it for you. - Great! Is it fun? - Yes. - Here. No need. I'll press it on my own. Maisy, Grandpa said you scored many As. What do you want Dad to give you? Toys! The pork chop. I don't want anything except for one thing. What is it? Happiness! Tommy, it's your turn. All right. Happiness? No way! I have Linda here and you have George there. How can we have happiness? Maisy, from what I see, George is really cool. Dad can't be compared to him. - Dad. - Yes? It's not true. I think you're better. Sure. There's no use anyway. He keeps Mom company all the time. Just like super glue. They're stuck together. I'm worried about Dad. Will things end for Dad soon? But here's the thing. If Mom gets married to George, you'll have a new dad. You'll have to change your surname. You'll have a new mom too. Yes. But I don't need to change my surname. We'll just suddenly have two dads and two moms. Our lives are becoming more and more complicated. But it's quite fun. There'll be two more people buying toys for us. Dad, can you hear us? You're in a dangerous position. It's very dangerous. Here we are. We've arrived! Maisy! Hey, wait for me. Thank you. Hey. - I'll pick you up later. - Okay. - Linda. - Yes? - Bye. - Bye. Look at that shameless couple. - Come here. - What is it? I have something to say to you. Hey, what are you doing? I'm talking to my husband. It's none of your business. He's your husband? As long as we haven't signed the papers, he's still my husband. Come here. Do you think a public performance is nice to see? Will others enjoy it? You're just telling the whole world that Tommy's dad is messing around. Shameless. You want others to say that about your son? Look who's talking. At least, I wouldn't do that in public. Do you want me to? All right. I can announce right away that Tommy and Maisy have two dads. Are you satisfied then? I nearly got it. Yes. Grandpa, come! Hurry! It's fun. Grandpa, come on! Grandpa, be careful. Grandpa, Mom and Dad are quarreling again. Grandpa, they look like they'll start hitting each other. No, they're just jealous. They'll get back together. What games do they have inside? - There are many games. - What are they? BUDDHA - What's that? - No idea. Here comes Grandpa! - Grandpa. - Grandpa. What's that on top of the mountain? It's a temple. - Is it a fun place? - It's not for fun. It's a place where people pray to Buddha. - Does it work? - I don't know about that. - In the past... - Grandpa, watch out! I'm fine. Don't be scared. I don't know if it works. However, your late grandma was after me for years but she failed. Somebody taught her to pray there. And then I've been with her ever since. That means it works! Let's go pray that Dad and Mom will get back together. Don't be so superstitious. Why don't you pray to me instead? I have lots of tricks. - Looks who's talking. - What is it? You taught us to drive Dad mad the other night. But he was fine after a while. What a lousy idea. It's different this time. If you want them to get back together, both of you have to work together. The day after tomorrow is your mom's birthday. I've prepared a gift. Maisy, you'll hand the gift to Mom. - Tell her it's from Dad. - Okay. Tommy, you'll need to use battered-body ruse. Coax your dad into writing a few words. Grandpa, what's a battered-body ruse? Try to piss him off into hitting you. Tommy, it's late. Why aren't you sleeping? What do you mean by this? You're at fault but you're crying? Hit me then. Just hit me to death. I don't like your girlfriends. Send me to an orphanage. Put me down! I want to draw! I'm warning you to stop. - Stop drawing. - I want to. I'll keep drawing. I want to draw! I'm going to hit you now. Can you hear me? Really, I'm going to. Stop it! Stop drawing! You really hit me? Grandpa, you've put me in trouble. What does it have to do with Grandpa? He said you wouldn't hit me for real. You're terrible, Grandpa. You only love Linda now. You don't love me anymore. Why? You can't answer me though I asked you. Forget it! Mom! Mom, I'm so pitiful. Dad doesn't love me anymore. Mom! Tommy, be good. Dad loves you. It's not for real. You wouldn't hit me if you love me. You made a mistake. Of course I need to teach you a lesson. I did it because I love you. That's a funny way to love me. Grandpa... You're a good boy. Dad loves you most. Come. Let's sleep. No! You don't love me at all. I love you. Action speaks louder than words. You need to prove it with your action. A pinky swear? That's what your generation does. Nowadays, we sign a contract. A contract? Are you doing it or not? All right. Sure. Really? Write it down. Wait a minute. Write "I love you". There you go. You didn't sign your name. Who would know whom it's from? WING CHEUNG I've signed it. No recipient's name. Who would know whom it's for? Write "For my dearest Tommy". FOR MY DEAREST TOMMY Smart kid. Grandpa, what do we do next? Next, you'll give the present. Good. Now, it's Maisy's turn to get beaten. Tommy, you have a mission too. You need to pretend to be sick. I'll get an injection for that. Why do I always get the worst task? Do you want your dad and mom to get back together? What should I do then? Think about it on your own. How is it? Have you thought about it? Where do you want to celebrate your birthday? Do you know why I've separated from my husband? Yes. Both of you have similar personalities. Too self-centered and are not willing to compromise. How will you treat me then? I'll put up with you. Then, you'll lose yourself. Leaving your toys everywhere again. I'll get you if you mess around again. Dad, do you know whose birthday it is today? No! The lady boss! The Queen? You're crazy. That was a long time ago. What date is it? The 29th. The 29th? Why don't you call her? Here. - It's time to sleep. - Okay. Dad, my legs feel like jelly. I think I'm sick. I have a fever and I feel dizzy. I'm hot all over. I'm going to die this time. I'm really going to die. I'm really sick. - Dad, no! - Sick? - Dad, I dare not anymore. - Are you sick? Sick? You little brat. Sleep. Don't wet your bed. Now what? Dad, I'm really sick. I'm not. I'm not sick anymore! Dad, I dare not anymore. I'm not sick anymore! So useless. I fail whenever he tickles me. What should I do now? - Take this to your mom. - Okay. - Please come in. - Thank you. - Put it here. - All right. - Thank you. - Thank you. Quickly. Take it to her. Mom, what are these? Birthday presents from George. Look how pretty it is. Hey, why didn't you give it to her? I don't want Dad to look bad. Silly, it's not about the price and quantity. It's the thought that counts. Go on. - Go on. - Okay. Mom. You're such a good girl. You remember my birthday. It's not from me. It's from Dad. - Dad? - Yes. "For my dearest Tommy's mom, I love you. Wing Cheung." FAMILY PLANNING ENSURE HAPPINESS IN FAMILY What's so great about these clothes? Grandpa. Come here. What is it? Grandpa, how come there's no reaction? She must be so touched that she can't think straight and drank pesticide. This is bad. - Hello. - Hello, Maisy. - Dad. - Where's your mom? She's here. - It's Dad. - Maisy. Hello? Quickly get your mom. Dad, hold on. Mom! Open the door! Mom, open the door! What's the matter? - Dad is on the phone. - That's right. Answer it. Go on. It's settled! Hello, Wing Cheung. Zheng Nam, please come over. Tommy's sick. He's having a fever. - Dad, I want Mom. - He's babbling now. He's never like this. - Mom. - He's calling out for you. Come over. All right. I'll come over now. - Hello, Zheng Nam. - Yes? Thank you. Tommy is sick. I need to go there and see him. Grandpa, should we go together? Of course. Let's go. Sorry, George. My son is sick. We need to go and see him. You wait for me inside. Nancy. Grandpa. That's right. Stand here and watch over the apartment. - Keep watch. - All right. Dad. Why did you and Mom separate? You're too young to understand. Why did you get married then? Did you have Maisy and me for fun? Your mom is here. I'll get the door. How's Tommy? The doctor said he almost got pneumonia. He was given a shot and is resting now. Come on in. - Dad. - Good girl. Go in. I'll close the door. Tommy! Mom! - Tommy! - Mom! What a pity. Your face is all red from the fever and your body is so hot. Just a little. I'm fine. Mom, I'd be worse if you didn't come. His fever was at 103 degrees. Fever of 103 degrees? It's not a big deal. It's only 103 degrees. Grandpa said he was fine even when he got a fever of 700 degrees. Isn't that right, Grandpa? I meant my eyeglass prescription. Stop talking. Go to bed. I'll keep you company. There's no need to accompany me. Just accompany Dad and be lovey-dovey. I'll go first. Bye. - Go on. - That's right. I'll accompany Tommy. Go and have a drink with Zheng Nam. - Go on! - Grandpa and I will accompany Tommy. - Mom, go out with Dad. - Yes. - Go on. - Go on. Mom. - Mom, go on. - Let's go. Go on. I will be back soon. Don't come back so soon. Go as long as you can. - Smart kid. Go on. - Go on. You're a smart kid. Your acting was so real. Grandpa, I'm not acting. - I'm really sick. - Really? Are you really sick? You love to bluff. I got myself wet and stood in front of the air-conditioner. Let me see. You're as hot as a furnace. What a pity. Grandpa, do you think Mom and Dad will get back together? I'm sure of it! That's right. Don't worry. They will. Tommy. Why don't we pray that Dad and Mom will get back together? All right! Will our prayer be answered? - Why don't we toss a coin? - What's that? If it's heads, it means they'll be together again. Grandpa, lend me a coin. All right. Why don't I toss it? Close your eyes and pray. It's heads! - It's heads! - It's heads! - That's great! - That's great! - Dad and Mom will get back together! - It's great! How have you been? I'm fine. You? Good. Pretty good. You seem to have lost weight. Really? It's a trend now. Thanks for your birthday present. Present? What present? You've given me the present. Why don't you admit it? I didn't give you a present. It's probably from your boyfriend. I wouldn't try to ingratiate with you. Why would you do that with your girlfriend then? When have you seen me do that with her? Just admit it. Why are you being sneaky? Don't talk to me like that. You're just like before. We're in public. What's wrong with my choice of words? Why are you shouting if you know we're in public? You always talk back. What's so great about you? I'm not sweet and gentle. So? I'm not talking to you anymore. You're so unreasonable. Go and find your George! Maisy. Why don't you stay here tonight? - All right? - Sure. But I didn't bring my clothes and homework. Bless you. I'll bring them over tomorrow. But I'll be very pitiful. I'll be a lonely old man. Grandpa, why don't you move in and stay with us? Will I sleep in the living hall? No, you can sleep in the maid's room. When a new maid comes, you can sleep with her then. - Shame on you! - Shame on you! - Shame on you! - Shame on you! Grandpa, stop it. Maisy. Tommy. Your dad and I have made up our minds. Both of you will not be happy if you are separated for a long time. So, it's either both of you stay in Hong Kong with Dad, or go to Canada with George and Mom. It doesn't work. The coin said they'd get back together. It's got nothing to do with it. Grandpa! If the both of you stay together, all is well then. Dad, it doesn't concern you. Stay out of this. Okay. I'll stay out of it. Well, have you two decided? Will you follow me or Dad? Mom, you and Dad always decide for us. This time, can we decide for ourselves? Maisy. We've thought it over. We're choosing neither of you. If we follow Dad, we'll be betraying Mom. If we follow Mom, we'll be betraying Dad. - We'll rely upon one another for survival. - We'll rely upon one another for survival. - Maisy! - Tommy! Let's talk about it next time. Take Maisy home first. Go on. Tommy. I'll leave first. Give me a kiss. Maisy, let's go home. - Grandpa. - Yes? The house is safe. How is Tommy? What's wrong with him? Why are you still here? You're breaking up our happy family! If not for you, all of us would be together! Leave! - Maisy, you... - Leave! - Maisy, what's the matter? - Leave! Leave! I don't want to go to Canada with you! I'll never go. Tommy and I will never go! Leave! Maisy, shut it! She's sleepy. She needs to sleep. Follow me to bed. I think all of us are tired. Rest earlier. I'll pick you up tomorrow. Grandpa, none of your plans work. I have many tricks. We failed today, but we'll think of another idea tomorrow. Let's sleep first. Maisy! - Dad, open the door. - I will open it tomorrow. - I want to teach her a lesson. - Do it tomorrow. Dad! Maisy, why were you so rude to my friend? Stretch out your hand! How can you scold George? It's not up to you to decide whether you're going to Canada or not. When did you get so naughty? You gave me a present in your dad's name. Do you know how embarrassing that was? You're too much! Don't hit her. You should hit me. I told her to do it. I meant well for your family. Was I wrong to do that? Was it wrong for her to help you? The youngsters are innocent. You gave birth to them so you have to be responsible for them. You give birth to them and separate them as you wish. A kid is not a souvenir item. Let me give you a piece of advice. Even if you remarry in the future, think before you have kids. Don't harm any more innocent children. Mom. I don't want to go to Canada with George. I just want my dad, mom, brother and grandpa to be together. I want a happy family. I'm not being unfair. I can't take care of all of you. You'll have to look after yourselves. Bye. Bye. Tommy! Hey, Maisy! Why are you here to see me this late? I came to say goodbye. I'm running away from home. Running away from home? That sounds like fun! Take me with you. Wait for me. Tommy! I'm a general. I'll look after my troops. - Tommy. - Maisy. Why are you taking the tortoise along? To remind myself. Grandpa said not to be a coward like a tortoise. With me around, you have nothing to fear. Wait, I forgot my toothbrush and toothpaste. Tommy, there is no need. I have some chewing gum. Let's go. Maisy, where are we going? To make a wish. Hello. Hello, Wing Cheung. It's Zheng Nam. Is Maisy there? I don't think so. Let me take a look. No, she's not. No? She left a letter saying she wants to run away from home. Run away from home? Hold on. Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Hey! Tommy! Damn it! Tommy! Tommy! Zheng Nam, this is bad. Tommy is missing too! Tommy is missing too? Hey, don't scare me! I can't take it. I've searched the entire house, but he's nowhere to be found. Do you think they ran away together? Let's go to the police! Let's meet at the police station. See you later. - Linda. I need to... - That advertising company is too much. They want me to take a wedding photo and put it at Tai Ping Shan. So that people can see it even from Malaysia. - It's so exaggerated, right? - Linda. My son and daughter ran away from home. I'm heading to the police station. What will you do? - I'll go with you. - Hurry. Let's go. Hurry up. George! We'll go in his car. Send me to the police station. What happened? My grandchildren went missing. Maisy, how much further? We'll reach soon. My goodness, I wonder if Bobby is suffocating in there. Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! - Tommy, come back! - Bobby! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! - Bobby! - Tommy! Tommy! Maisy, be careful! Maisy, be careful! Tommy! Maisy! Tommy! Maisy! Tommy! Tommy! - Maisy! - Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Maisy! Maisy! Here. Keep out from the rain. Hello. How are you? I'm George. - I... - Don't bother now. Let's file the report. What's the matter? - Our children ran away this morning. - Yes. When I was trying on the wedding gown this morning, - they were already missing. - That's right. It means you had kids before you getting married? No, they are my children. Not hers. Sorry, I have mistaken. So it's your children? What's your name? I'm George Ma. - So you're the children's dad? - No. - No, I'm their dad. - That's right. You're the dad? That means... Forget it. Let's drop this. Let me get the address. Where do you stay? My address or my kids'? Not you. Where do the children stay? The elder or the younger one? Why is it so complicated? Okay. Start with the elder one. The elder one? You say it. - She stays at... - Let me. She stays at Number Two, Third Floor, Lomond Road. That means all of you stay there. No, I stay at Number Three, Second Floor, Chun Yeung Street. Which is the right address? You're making me confused. Officer, don't listen to him. Let me tell you. The elder one lives at Number Two, Third Floor, Lomond Road. The younger one lives at Number Three, Second Floor, Gong Go Road. I bet you don't live at any of the addresses. That's right. I don't live at any of the addresses. - I live at Repulse Bay Road... - That's enough. This is so complicated. I can't take it. Actually, it's very simple. Let me make it clear. - Where do you stay? Don't tell me. - I stay at... - Who are you? - I'm their grandpa. Of these four, whose grandfather are you? None of them. I'm the children's grandfather. This is my daughter. This is my future son-in-law. He might be. This is my son-in-law. He might be my ex-son-in-law. This pretty lady's status is still unknown. With such a complicated family, no wonder they ran away from home. Here. Hello, police. Two dead children found at the reservoir? Yes! How old are they? The elder one is eight to ten years old. The younger one is five to seven years old. A boy and a girl. All right. I'll send people there. Don't cry. Maybe it's not them. That's right. Go take a look first. Hey, 7086. Take them there. You may leave first. Keep in touch. Sorry, I need to check it out with my wife. Take care. Hey! Why don't I send you home? Okay. - What's your name? - I'm Linda. We've looked everywhere. Not a trace. - Keep searching. - Okay. What is it? Sergeant sent them to identify the bodies. See if they're your children. Okay. Could it really be them? Of course not. Where did they go? I hope Buddha will bless them. Buddha? Grandpa, what's that on top of the mountain? It's a temple. Grandpa, is it a fun place? It's not for fun. It's a place where people pray to Buddha. Let's go pray that Dad and Mom will get back together. They must have gone there! Where? - Dad, hurry up. - Wait up. Master. Have you seen these two children? No. Thank you. Let's go. They're over there! - They've shaved their heads? - Tommy! Maisy! Tommy! - Maisy! Tommy! - Maisy! - Mom is coming! - Maisy. Put me down. Tommy, why did you come here to be a monk? I'm not Tommy! Put me down! - Put me down! - I'm not Maisy! My name is Liu Yan. My name is Sam Tak. Maisy, is this the place? - Yes. Let's go. - Okay. Please don't make noise. Maisy and I want to talk to Buddha. Can you please don't make noise? Please excuse them. Maisy, hurry. Come over here! Thank you. Maisy, quickly say it. You said you've thought about what to say. Quickly, tell Buddha. Buddha. Grandpa said you're really great. He said Grandma prayed to you and he was with her ever since. We've come a long way to pray to you. Tommy nearly drowned. I'm fine. You were the one who nearly drowned. Don't talk. You're so clumsy. You're being indirect. Let me do the talking. Buddha! In order to see you, Maisy and I nearly drowned. We walked until our feet are swollen before we reached. You're just sitting here so comfortably. Be serious. Sorry, Buddha. - Buddha. - Have you seen these two... Please grant us a happy family. Maisy, don't cry. You're so weak. Buddha. Other than begging my parents for toys, I have never begged anyone. I'm begging you now. Don't let Dad and Mom separate. If they separate, we're as good as orphans. No, we'll indeed be orphans. Both of them are brainless. They care only for themselves. They don't care about us. Buddha, don't let Dad and Mom separate. I'm begging you, Buddha. Grandpa is the only one who's nice to us now. He's very old already. If he dies, no one will be nice to us anymore. - Tommy! - Maisy! - Maisy! - Tommy! - Maisy! - Tommy! - Tommy! Maisy! - Tommy! Maisy! - Tommy! - Mom! - Dad! - Mom! Mom! Mom and Dad will never separate again. That's right. Subtitle translation by Angel Choo
