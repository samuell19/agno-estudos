Move the firewood quickly. A witch cannot kill a baby without the Iroko tree knowing. As I have said, so shall it be. Trees and wind make a rhythm. As I said at night, I said in the day. Kneel down. If I call the police on my master, this shrine shall kill me. If I use witchcraft against my master, this shrine shall kill me! If I use witchcraft against my master, this shrine shall kill me. So shall it be! As I said at night, I said in the day. A witch cannot kill a baby without the Iroko tree knowing. If anyone wants to harm me because I am in Europe, this shrine shall kill them. If anyone wants to harm me because I am in Europe, this shrine shall kill them. Move the firewood quickly. Let it rub, let it stick. As I said at night, I said in the day. She has taken the oath. Take a drink to them! Protect her from the living and from the dead. Here, drink to it. When you eat, you drink. Trees and wind make a rhythm. Sit down. A witch cannot kill a baby without the Iroko tree knowing. Trees and wind make a rhythm. I need your finger and toe nails. Toe nails too. Okay, anytime... When you're able to pay the debt. - Yes. - When you have paid the debt, tell your mother to come collect this. - Yes, sir. - This stays here. So if you don't pay... - you know... - I will pay. That is what I need you here for, to make sure you pay up. If you have problems in Europe, let me know. Yes. So, I will help you, if you pay. If you don't pay, I will pursue you. Yes. Twirl it around seven times. Get up and throw it out. Quick. Come and take this. Spit on it. Hit it hard. Hit it! No man will hinder you. No police, be it in Germany, Italy, France or Spain. Quick, quick! Forbidden until you've passed in the night and in the day. Any problems with the police or any other, spit it out, spit it out! Quick, quick. Any witchcraft in my mother's house, or in my father's house... bind them all here. Be it in my mother's or father's house, bind it here. As I have said, so shall it be. Spit it, spit it! Go talk to that one. No. Not a fucking blackie, man! Should have gone with the one before. No, you're not my type. - Hello. - Hello. - How much? - Fifty. Okay, get in. Stand up. Hello? It's me, Joy. I'm here with Precious. Is her family there? Okay, please give them the phone. Hello. I'd like to send money to Nigeria. Yes. How much? Two hundred. Yes, Mum. Even if the journey was very, very, very hard. We had to go inside a boat. Just imagine me, that cannot swim, inside a boat. Then, when the boat capsized... I couldn't... I thought I was already dead, that's what I was thinking. I was already thinking, "Okay..." But thank God, just thank God for the safe journey. Okay. I cannot send more money this month, but from next month, I will send the money to you. Yes, because I have a lot of expenses this month. I really miss you guys. Yes, give me to him. Hello? God, your voice has changed! I've missed you so much. Yes, yes. Oh, my God, this is very beautiful. Everywhere is beautiful. Light is always here 24 hours, like... non-stop. They never take the light. Just imagine how cool it would be. Me too. I miss you too. Don't worry, I'm going to send something to you next month. I'll send a present to you next month. Mom is going to give it to you. Being the personal assistant of a celebrity, you're a celebrity, too. - Yes, of course. - Because you're with her 24/7, wherever she is. But not with this kind of arrogant person. Precious. Come eat! Our baby of the house. Precious, what's up? What happened? You don't work yesterday. She's thinking about money. She didn't work? Please, leave Precious alone. Our baby in the house. She was just sitting all night. Sitting all night. She was just sitting there looking at me, watching me. Move! - What's up? - Good morning, Ma. Welcome. - Good morning. - How are you? Welcome. Complete. Bleble. How are you? I'm fine. Your money feels light today. No, Ma. It's not light. You trust your girl. You always look radiant. No, you're the pretty one. - Okay. - Thank you, Ma. Welcome, Ma. - How are you? - Fine, Ma. You hear from your parents at home? Is the money complete? - Yes. - You hear from your mum? - You haven't? - No. I'll get you a card, so you can call them. - Complete. - Okay. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - What is this? - Your money. Crayfish money? What's in here? I did my job and I'm giving you the money. Does it matter how? Don't you see how the others give it to me? That's not my problem. I'm giving it to you. The money is correct. You can do that when you're a madame. - Thank you. - We'll see about that. The money is correct. - This is your money? - Yes. - Is it complete? - Yes. Okay. For Precious. Give her the money to give me. What is this? Did they tie your mouth? What is this? Money. Money. How much is it? - Two-hundred and fifty. - What was the agreement? It's 1000. Madame, don't worry. She will try harder next time. - She just came one week ago. She's new. - Of course. - She's trying to learn. - Of course she'll learn. She couldn't do better than this. Of course. Give her the money to give me. You are not her messenger. Do you know how many girls want to be in the position you're in? I am trying to do my best to see that you people have a good life. I brought you from Africa to this place for you to have a good life. Ma, please, this job is too hard for me to do. I don't want to do this job. Please, Ma, any other job. I can clean, cook, wash. I can do anything, clean your house. - Please, any other job. - Too hard? Before you came here, you knew what you were coming to do. - I didn't know. - Don't tell me you don't know what to do. You wanted to come to Europe. Now you are in Europe. So you have to work and give me my money. Like it or not, you are a prostitute now. You have to pay me my money. You are owing me 60,000 euros. That's why I said I can do another job, not this job. Any job but this one. Madame, I beg you. Please collect this one. I'll make sure she balances you 1000 from next week. Of course you will really try your best, because if she doesn't pay me, you are going to pay the money. - But why? - Why? You don't know? I gave you the responsibility to take care of her. I can barely pay myself. You want me to pay for two? Joy, stop arguing with me! Enough of your nonsense! Come. Don't resist. Be quiet. What about make-up? You got any ideas? Make-up we can use for her. Something to bring out the shape of her face. I want something that will pop her color out. Make her look more sexy, more beautiful. Yeah, that one will give her the color. The Fashion Fair. Or Opera. - Black Opera? - Yes. Mm-hm. I will try that one. And lipstick? We have this... Medicare lipstick, or the classic. Precious! Come. Come on, try this on. Go in there, put these on. Don't waste my time, be fast. Hurry up. Come. Come on, try these shoes on. Pull the dress down. The shoes are fine. Try on with the shoes first. Up. Walk with it. Precious, don't fall from that. Stand here. Stand like this. Look at me. Now, move. First of all, you start slowly. Move. Yeah, catwalk! You're on stage. Stop. Turn around. Start again. Go there and start again. Now, chest out. Stand straight. Your shoulders up. I'm not saying you should look at the ceiling. Stand normally. Yeah. Slowly. She's not happy. This thing's worth ten million. You can see she's doing it because she sees money. She's got money and she's walking well. Turn around. Why are you sitting? You think we're joking here? You think you are here to play? Stand up and walk. You have to pull yourself together and get used to it because you have to pay your money. I cannot be paying for myself and paying for you. This is serious. This is not a joke. You have to start getting used to these things. This job is the hardest job ever. How can you sleep with so many different men? - You don't even know them. - We don't look at the faces. You think about where you're going, because you have a goal. Don't look at the faces. You look at the money. You target your goal. You concentrate on what you want to get. This is why you need to start working now. So that you have the experience. You know how to manipulate these men to get the money. And if you're lucky, you might even get someone who's nice to you and will help you pay off the debts before you know it. Thank you. Thank you. I'll try. Of course, you have to. And thank you for protecting me from her. I'm sorry I got you into trouble. I promise not to do it again. Don't thank me. Because from now on, I can't defend you anymore. You have to start paying your money by yourself. And I'll give you a piece of advice. In this game, it's the survival of the fittest. That means if I have to kill you to pay off my debts, I will. If I have to steal from you, I will do that. And I don't trust you, so don't trust me either. Only trust yourself. I'll give you something. You put this on whenever you go to the streets. It will bring you luck. Whatever disasters, whatever sorrow, whatever failure, whatever regret, whatever accidents, whatever evil on any person that I've left for this year, I will not be a partaker in the name of the Lord. They will not locate my house. They will not locate my name. In the name of the Lord. I'll need an extra 20 euros for the kindergarten. - So I will need more... - Okay. Okay. Chioma, say bye to Mommy. Let's go. Say bye to Mommy. - Give Mommy a kiss. - Say bye to Mommy. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye, Mommy. - Bye. Chi! Bye-bye. Bye. Chioma... Chi, say bye-bye to Mommy. Bye. - Bye-bye. - Chi, say bye to Mommy. Bye, Mommy! Bye! Slide down a bit towards me. Thank you. And now relax. Just hold on, please. Great. We're all done, thanks. You can get dressed. Okay. Press firmly for a little while. So, see you again in six weeks. Okay. - Evening. - Hi. - You can do something for me. - Okay. Precious wants to meet that guy from yesterday. Hey, which guy? That one with garlic breath? God forbid! Garlic breath? Precious, you're mad! They'll beat you. While I was talking to him, the garlic was possessing my brain. But you spent time with him yesterday. But you liked his money. It's the money. ♪ Precious said She not come for the body, ohhh ♪ ♪ She come for the money, ohhh ♪ - He had garlic breath. - You spent time with him yesterday. He paid very well. That's the reason. I was holding myself not to vomit, Jesus Christ. - Oh, my God. - Is it that bad? I wanted to ask him if he ever brushed his teeth. I want to highlight you. Highlight me. I'm going to be shining. - Not "ilight." "Highlight." - Highlight. That one will be your highlight. Power of makeup. I have not seen it, but it's perfect. You're supposed to buy the drinks for the party. Of course. Now that you make more money. - How do I make more money? - Shut up! - You're the hottest babe now. - Of course. - Hello. - Hi, darling. This is my friend Chris. - Hi. Nice meeting you. - Hello. I hope you didn't give them my name. I hope you didn't tell them anything about me, like... No names, no police. You should have asked me first if I want to, because I don’t want to have anything to do with the police, like, I don’t want any trouble, I don’t want to get into any trouble with the police, with my madame. You know, you should ask me before you do something like this. Why would you even... I want to help you. - Yes, but... - I want you to stay here. Yes, I know, but you should ask me, you know, before you make an appointment for me. Do you know if I want to go there? I don’t want to get into trouble with the police, really. And my madame too, I don’t want to get... Because if she hears this, it is going to be a very big problem for me. I know, but they guaranteed that no police are involved. And they guaranteed that no one will know about it. Not your name, nothing. We'll go there during the day and I'll have your back. Yeah, but... I don't want anything bad to happen to you. I know you are trying to help, but you should at least ask me, you know? Hey. Precious, don't be so noisy. I'm trying to clean the mess you guys left on the floor. Look at the way you just threw stuff on the floor. Little kids wouldn't even make a mess like this. Watch what you do, Precious. What kind of thing is this? Move your leg. - Don't sweep my leg. - Move your leg now! - Madame, good morning. - Good morning. This way you are dressing, where are you going? I want to get some things from the shop... some food stuff. With your hair and everything? You need to be so beautiful to go to the supermarket just to buy things? Are you sure you're not going to your boyfriend's place? - Madame, I don't have a boyfriend. - Morning. Good morning. Auntie Joy, remember to buy toilet paper. We're almost out. That green one, don't buy the blue one. - The green one is very soft. - Okay. What's the name of that thing again? I forgot the name. - It makes the bathroom whiter. - Okay. The thing that cleans the bathroom. That's finished too, please buy some. Don't forget. Please buy it. Last time I told her, she didn't buy it. Okay. What about the other girls? It's still morning. They're still sleeping. If someone speaks against the madame, if someone speaks against her madame, not me, like a friend, so is there any guarantee that at the end of the procedure that something positive is going to happen? Like, maybe she will get, like, a… a working permit or a visa, you know, a permit to stay here. What's… Is there any guarantee… for this? Unfortunately, there is no guarantee. Not 100% guarantee, but there is the possibility to try to achieve... that you can stay, that the person that sues a madame can stay and can remake her life here. Why should someone make a sacrifice for other people? Because me speaking out, it’s to stop it from happening to other girls. Then what happens to me? Then I should get sacrificed for someone else? Is that the point? One person has to sacrifice for the other people or what? Yes, this stays a dilemma, that’s true. And, you know, you don’t have so many options. That’s part of the problem, you’ve got asylum negative. Yes, but… my question, the main point now is... if the government doesn’t grant this person a visa or a permit to stay, or a working permit, and if this person cannot stay and has to go back to Nigeria, so what's the point of going through all this risk? What's the gain, what's the point? Because you still have to go back to Nigeria anyway and your family are in a big danger. You are in danger. They know your house, they know everything about you. The family are there, your family is there, the madame's people are there, everyone is there, and the juju priest is there. Everything is still going to work against you, so tell me what's the point? Juju, what does that mean? Juju? Juju is widely practiced in Nigeria. It's a religious practice that is unfortunately abused by some priests. Women are taken there to swear an oath. In the oath, they say, "Okay, if you take me to Europe, I'll pay back the money for the journey and never collaborate with the police." The juju priest usually keeps a bag with personal concerns of the woman who swore the oath, or a photo, which he keeps with him. As long as she's not paid it off, she's bound to the oath. This has huge consequences for the women, because many believe so strongly in it that it can break them. You know the way this job is hard. You know how hard this job is, that's what I'm trying to do. I still do the job. I'm trying my best. What do you expect? I don't work in a bank. How do you expect me to have that kind of money? What happened? Okay. To the hospital! My mate is what? My mate is what? My mates pay their own money. Go on, ask them for it. What do you want me to do now? I'm working hard here. I have to pay Madame the money. Okay, I will try and send you... I mean, five million naira is a lot of money. I don't have that kind of money now. But I will try and send you what I have now. So you can start the treatment immediately. I don't want him to go through any stress, any suffering. I don't want him to suffer more than he is doing already. I mean... So without the money, they cannot commence the treatments? Okay, I'll... Okay, I will send you what I have, so they can start treating him immediately. I don't know how I will get the rest, but, yeah, I will try. I don't know. I have no idea how I'll come up with the rest, but I will just bring what I have now. And... You start and then I will... think of how to come up with the rest. I don't know what is wrong with these people. Neighbor's daughter brought money, bought a car, bought everything. I don't know. I don't know what they expect me to do, to go and sell myself. As if I came to Europe to buy a car... She even said that this job is not hard. I should sleep with more men, like the other girls are doing. I tell her it's a horrible job. She says, "It's not that hard," and... - Send 600 euros? - Yes. "It's not that hard to sleep with someone you don't love." My own mother, who gave birth to me. She asked me for too much money. Everything okay? Everything's okay? You're alright? No problem. It's fine. Are you sure? - Found something? - Yes. Pepper beef. From the last time. - May I take your order? - Pepper beef, please. Okay. With rice? Yes. - And you, sir? - Bulgogi. Sure. Something to drink? - Two glasses of red wine, please. - Sure. - Thanks. - Thank you. A little surprise for you. Open it. Ooh! Wow! You can pay off your debt. You won't have to do it with different men all the time. I have a great idea. We rent an apartment... Excuse me. - There you go. - Thank you. You live there with your daughter. You'll never want for anything. I'll shop for you. No one will know where it is. So the madame can't find you. Neither the authorities nor anyone else. Wow, this is really generous of you. I mean, I didn't expect it. Thank you very much. Yeah... But I... I will have to send this money to Nigeria because my father is really sick. What's wrong with him? Yeah. They called me. He is sick and he is in the hospital, and I need a lot of money for his treatment, but this is... This really came at the right time, because it is going to help a lot. And I have to support him. He needs to do a kidney transplant. The money is so we can live together, it's for... our future. Yes, I know. But, you know, this started to happen after I went to the NGO, you know? And I think it's, like, a punishment from the juju or, like, a warning, so I cannot let him die, you know. I have to do something. That's ridiculous, it's nonsense. - Yes, the juju... - He has a photo of you. - This is not a joke. - He has your photo and money. That's all he cares about. This is not a joke. I'm serious. I came from there and I know what it is. - It's serious. - If he is sick, it's just a coincidence. It's not a joke, okay? He's sick because of me, and it's because of the voodoo. I don't believe it. You'll send it to your family, or you might even keep it. He's really sick, and this is a warning. You know, like a punishment. - No... I have to do something. I cannot have this kind of money and my father is dying. This is pointless. It's always about sending money. And now this story again. These are all stories. No, give me back the money. This is over. We won't meet again. My family comes first, you know. They are my priority and I’m here because of them. I do everything I'm doing because of them. I’m struggling for them, you know. So I… You have your own family. You cannot leave. Are you going to leave your wife and your kids for me? It's best to end it. - Seriously? - Yeah. I don't trust you anymore. I'm not sure what you do with the money. Maybe it's all an act. And you tell me your dad is sick. Let's end it. This is pointless. - Are you serious? - Yes. Okay. Here is okay. No, I know a good spot for us. Why are you driving so far away? I have to walk a lot when I'm coming back. I'll bring you back. Don't worry. Okay, you know what, stop, let me out. I want to go out. Please stop the car. Let me out. Please, stop the car. I want to go out. Can you please stop the car? I want to go out. Joy! What happened? Should I call an ambulance? - No, it's okay. - No? Okay? Take two. Don't worry. You're going to be fine. I know you are a strong girl. And I know the pains you are going through. You will be okay. In a few days' time, you will be okay. The bleeding also will stop and everything will stop. Okay? That's not helping anything. The tablets are not helping anything. They're painkillers, they don't stop the bleeding. She's bleeding! We need to take her to the hospital. You have so many connections, just call someone who studied medicine. - because she's bleeding. - No. She cannot go to hospital. But the pills aren't stopping the bleeding. They're not magic. - Call a doctor or something. - Precious... Precious, she doesn't have a visa. They can deport her. Do you want her to be deported? Or do you think I'm happy seeing her suffering like this? It's only a question of time. Do you know how many times they raped me in my own time? They even stabbed me with a knife to my stomach. All of you know what you came here to do. In my own time, we didn't know it. They just told us, "You'll work as cleaners." This is how the job is in Europe. She will survive it. Joy, you are a strong girl. And if it is because of your father's treatment... I will give you the money. Thank you, Ma. It's not a gift. This is business. You will give me back with interest when you start working, okay? Okay. Welcome, Madame. Precious! - Ma? - Come, please. How was your trip? Everybody is fine. Did you bring anything for us? I bring good health. - I saw your family. - Welcome back, Ma. Please go. Go and buy some foodstuffs. Where? You know what is not in the house here. Foodstuff. Buy some foodstuff. - Okay. - Bye. How are your family? They are all doing fine. You know, I saw your family. They are very fine, even your father. - I saw your brother with a brand new car. - My brother? - Flashy car. - With a car? They have a rich daughter in Europe. I want you to do something for me, please. Tomorrow, you will take Precious to this place. Where is this? As soon as you reach this train station, you call this number. Then what happens to Precious? The man knows everything. Here is the passport also. So what happens to her? She will start working in Italy now. If you do your job well, I will reduce your debt. - Okay, Ma. - Okay. When you're there, you have to learn to keep quiet. Mind your own business. Come on, girls. The place is not as bad as you think. - People are living there. - You've not been there. I know, but people are living there. You should encourage her - and not, you know... - Precious, no worries, yeah? When you're free, you can still come and see us. Free? She'll be 30 when she's free. It won't take long until you're free. Come on, be encouraging. Sorry. Precious... Hurry up now. How long will it take you to put your things together? Please hurry up, let's go. Precious, don't worry, everything will be fine, okay? Let me hold my Precious before she goes. Everything will be fine. I will miss you. You don't want to hug me because I tell you the truth. Eh? You'll see that it's like I said. No worries, you hear? Everything will be fine. Try and respect the people. Our little baby. Safe journey, yeah? Take care. See, don't talk too much. Let's go, let's go, please. Let's go. - Take care of yourself. - Take care. - Bye. - Bye. Any new passengers, please? Hello. Any new passengers? Hello. Your tickets, please. Destination Lienz. Two passengers. Thank you. Have a pleasant trip. Good afternoon. Police, ID control. Show me your passport, please. Passport or ID. ID card, passport? Please pay attention to station announcements and departure boards. Thank you for traveling with us. Goodbye. Hello. Hello. Yeah, we missed the train. Um... We had to get out because there was a police control. - Where are you right now? - We are in Salzburg, in Bad Gastein. Bad Gastein? - Should I take the next train and come? - No! You stay where you are. Stay where you are, and I'll come and pick you up. Okay. We'll wait here. Yes, we'll wait. Okay. Okay, thank you. Bye. Carry your bag. Let's go. Can I just go? Can you give me my passport and I'll just go? Madame will think I ran away. Which passport? And where are you going to? She'll think that I ran away, tell her that the police got me. She'll believe you, the police almost got us now. Do you think that Madame would believe the police got you? And do you think it makes any sense or any difference to her? If I let you go, I'm going to pay your debts. And why should I do that? Do you think it's fair? For you to even think about it and talk about it, it's so unfair. So I should carry your cross for you and let you go and start to pay your own debts when I'm almost done with mine, right? If both of us run away, you don't have to pay my money. She'll believe the police caught both of us. I'm not part of it. I'm not going anywhere. Besides, I have already paid my own. I have almost paid mine. How long until you've finished paying? Seven, ten years? I'm almost done and I'll finish it very soon. And you have not even started. Okay? So we are not in the same shoes. If I run away with you, what happens to my daughter? For me, it's not an option and I'm not giving you any passport. You're not going anywhere. I'll deliver you safely to the guy when he comes, okay? So forget it. When is he coming? It's freezing. You know what? Let's look for somewhere to warm up, 'cause it's going to take some hours before he comes. Come. Here you are, ladies. Some more tea. Thank you. You're welcome. "Greetings. Thank you for granting us admittance. That shows you have a heart for old traditions. We bring only light, steadfastly opposing all the figures of darkness who keep even their own ones in chains.

For your support and all during my stay here. Thank you very much. You're welcome. You know everything I'm doing, it is for the betterment of you girls. Now you are free. You can do what you want. Thank you, Ma. So, do you see? She finished paying. Don't forget that I still like you. I know I'm sometimes not easy, but I like all of you, like my own children. Because we bring you money! Joy, do you want to join the madames now? It's not worth it. - I'm not even interested. - Better. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I will miss you. - I'm still here. - Let me collect the blessings. Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Madame, what about the juju? When we go... - and cancel the... - Don't worry about that. I'll call your mother and she'll go and meet them. When? Joy, I said your mother will go and collect it. Okay. Thank you, Ma. If you get card now, you better call. My sisters, come and help me! Joy is free! All these things, Joy paid for it. She paid for all this food. She said you should join me and eat. Joy... you'll meet a good man. Your bag will be full of money. Amen! You want to become a madame? Now that you are free, don't forget what she did to you. - You want to join these characters? - It's okay. Pay your madame! Pay your madame! Don't use your money to feed black boys, to cook soup for them and buy clothes for them! My sister, don't worry yourself. It's not all about putting on expensive clothes! The others understand what we went through. So, Auntie, I try to respect you. Thank God your mother is my sister. If your mother were not my sister, the things I would do to you! Go sell me like Precious. Please eat. Go on, eat something. Looks nice. I like this one. Just fresh. Fresh from Naija. - Fresh from Naija. - Fresh from Naija. I like them slim. I don't want them to go out of shape. In maybe... In a year or so, she'll go out... after eating burger. This one, every year young. Every year young. - I like her. What's your name? - Jennifer. - Turn around, let them see your package. - Jennifer! Great. I already like her, even from afar. When you were bringing her, I liked her already. - So, I like her. - You like her, huh? Yeah. Come on. Let me see. I just want to take a good look. Yeah, she looks good. - Don't worry, we'll touch you up a bit. - Upgrade. Yeah. Great. Jenny. Good, so... - Okay. We make a deal? - Yeah. So, you want to tell me how much? - How much? - 30K for you. Just for you. - Just for you. - Seriously? No, no, no. That's too much. You can make the money back in three months. You know how we do these things. I like her. I can just take her right now. Twenty. Okay, deal. - Good! - Deal, yeah? - That's my girl. - Okay. But first of all, I hope you've already told her what she's coming for. - Believe me, she's a good girl. - You're aware of what you are into? Okay. Very good. - Thank you. - She will not make any problems. - Good. - Come with me. Come with me. - Wow. - Wow. This one is wow. - What's your name? - Tina. Tina. Nice name. - Okay. How old are you? - I'm 18. Eighteen? Are you sure she's 18? - She's 18. - You're really sure? - She looks 18. - I don't want any problems. Let me see. Wow. I like the shape. But... That shape won't bring you money. No problem. I know how to do this one. I know you are going to... You have to be a good girl. I'm a nice person, but you respect me, you obey me, you will enjoy me. Be a good girl. Please, keep this one for me. If there's another one like this, let me know also. - Yeah. - Okay, no problem. Come with me. Let’s go with me. See package. See package. See package. Hm! Joy! Madame, welcome. So you too want to become a madame now? No, I'm just here to look at what is going on. I don't even have that kind of money. I'm just looking. Tell it to the birds. If I testify against the madame, will she be arrested by the police? Chances are quite good, I would say. The police has done a good job. Those last months, they have been observing her, they know so many things about her, but till now, nobody has testified. So you will be the first, so chances are quite good that she will go to jail. Afterwards, do I get a visa, a working permit? Well, about your permit to stay in Austria, now that you are testifying, giving names, giving addresses, helping the Austrian state to get a criminal to prison, you know, then you have got really new… new reasons to apply for asylum, which does not mean that you will get it, I have to tell you. It will be a long asylum process. We don’t know how it will turn out. But the possibility is there again. And do I get some money, like… do I get anything apart from the visa? Compensation or what? We don’t know where she hides her money, but, anyway, we will try to get a compensation for you. So where are you living at the moment? Still in the apartment with the madame? No, no, I found myself a small flat. You're not hanging out with those people, right? Which people? The people around the madame. Her friends. No. So you are not near their apartment and so on. This is very important, Joy, I tell you, 'cause if you go to trial, you have to be very clear on which side you are on. You have to stay away from those people also for your own safety. 'Cause now that you've paid your debts, you are a threat for the madame, and who knows what she's capable of doing. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes. - Are you very clear on that? Yeah. Well... She's not my type. A little too chubby. - There's more. Her, for example. - You know? She's too young. How old is she? - She's 20. - Twenty? - Yeah. - Could work out. And when can you... introduce her to me? If you want, I'll bring her next week. Next week? Okay. Yes, she looks pretty good. Yes, she looks pretty good. I hope that you bring me... a good replacement for you. - And the finances, we settle... - Between us. - Yes, not with her. - No, the two of us. - Okay. - Okay. So you can bring her by next week at the latest. - Hi, Joy. - Hi. - You good? - Yes. Okay. There you go. Can I have more? What? Can I have more? What for? For my sister. She's in Nigeria. She's sick. She's in the hospital. I have to send a lot of money. But... Well... That's a lot of money. No, that's all I have right now. I can't give you more. Yeah, thank you. Fine. Okay. Okay, hold this, hold this. Yay! You can push her, Chi. Senior sister. It's okay. Come on, come. It's okay. Come on, baby. Come on. Don't worry. I'll see you soon, okay? Don't worry, I'll be back soon. Good afternoon. Ms. Joy Ogbeide? - Yes. - Please go in. We have a deportation order to execute. Pack up your things and come with us. - Now? - Yes, immediately. Let's go. Move! Come. Okay. In two days' time, you come for your documents, and in that same two days' time, you also swear an oath in that two days' time, okay? - Eh... - Yeah. - Don't know if you understand this... - I understand you. - Okay, okay. - Okay. - So... - So, I beg you. Two days' time. I beg you, don't fail me, please. Okay, okay, okay. Sure, it will be ready. Just come for your documents and for the oath also. Okay? Okay. - Thank you. - All right.
