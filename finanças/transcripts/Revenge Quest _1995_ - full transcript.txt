(suspenseful music) (train crossing signal dings) (conductor speaking over intercom) (conductor drowned out by train) - Hey Rick, can I get you another drink? - Hey Rick, how's detective life going? - Hey, buzz off! - [Bartender] Yeah? - Yeah, sure. - [Woman] Hey, get the man a drink! So, I hear you're going on vacation? - [Rick] Just started it actually. Captain said I needed a break. - Well, what are you doing here? You should get out of the city! Go up north or something. I tell you Rick, if I had the money, I'd go up north. I hear it's beautiful up there. - Yeah, maybe I'll become a park ranger or something. - Oh, Rick Castle tracking killers to tracking squirrels. I like it. - At least squirrels don't carry guns. - (laughs) Yeah, squirrels and guns, right? (phone rings) - That's probably the captain making sure I'm not having too much fun. - [Bartender] Yeah. (wall phone beeps) - [Captain] Rick, we need you here right away. We got a crisis on our hands. - What kind of crisis? - [Captain] We need to talk about it in person. Where are you? - I'm in a small bar in the fourth sector. - [Captain] Okay, see you in 20. (typewriter keys tapping) (police radio chatter) - [Captain] Hi Rick, how you doing? - I'm fine. - Rick, I gotta ask you a big favor. Do you remember Trent McKormick? - [Rick] The serial killer? - Yeah well, he just escaped from Red Rock. Inside sources say he's on a revenge quest. - To avenge what? - [Captain] Julie Meyers, the woman who testified against him. - [Woman] Percentage is at 13.75%-- - Julie babe, you got those reports on Tec Ross Enterprises yet? - No, I'm still typing in the data for last month's percentages. - Well, if you come by my house tonight for a dip in my hot tub, I'll have Barbara take those data entries off your hands. - I can't, I have plans tonight. I'm taking my niece to a show. - Well, come by afterwards! - I have to use the restroom. - What the fuck you doing here? This is Chin's territory! - [Trent] Who the fuck is Chin? - He owns these streets. He's not gonna like you. So, why don't you turn your ass around and walk the fuck out of here? (chuckles) (screams) Now! - Fuck Chin! (man groans) (man groans) (gun shoots rapidly) (computer beeps) - He's been serving a life sentence at the Red Rock facility on Mars for the last five years. The warden said that he killed a guard and stole his uniform to disguise himself so that he could get on a cargo ship back to earth. - And when did this happen? - Three days ago. The cargo ship arrived in LA this morning. The guard was off duty at the time, so nobody noticed his disappearance until today. - So, he's presently walking the streets? - [Captain] Not for long. - Embarrassing. - Well, not embarrassing because nobody is going to find out. If the media gets wind of all of this, all hell will break loose. - You want me to... - [Captain] Find the bastard and bring him back. Now we don't know what he's wearing, but this is what he looked like five days ago. (computer beeps) I'm sure he's armed himself by now. - So, this guy's certifiable? And I have permission to blow him away. - The warden wants him back in one piece, no elimination. - No elimination? - We'll get a big bonus for this one, Rick. You'll finally be able to take that much needed vacation. - Do we have any leads? - [Captain] No, but I want you to go to Mrs. Meyers' apartment and take her to your place. She will be safest there. I sent a patrol officer over there to meet up with you. Report back to me when you get there. (suspenseful music) (computer beeps) (computer beeps) (suspenseful music) (machine buzzing) (machine humming) (phone rings) - Who is it? - [Trent] Trent. - Where the fuck are you? - [Trent] Back in LA. - You escaped from Red Rock? - [Trent] Yeah, I got some business to take care of. - [Man] And what's that? - The bitch who testified against me. - [Man] Where are you staying? - It's not important. I need your help. - [Man] With what? - Weapons. - I see that you're being extra careful, and not mentioning my business over the phone. But that's your style, right? Always direct. Well, we've got everything you need. Why don't you come by here around nine. If I'm not here, I'll leave George in charge. He'll take care of you. - Perfect. - How was it at Red Rock? Was it as bad as they say? - [Trent] Worse, they got us working like slaves up there. - And are Richard and Darius okay? - [Trent] Richard is fine. Darius got himself killed. - [Man] What happened? - I killed him. - I thought he was going to help you escape? - [Trent] He did. There wasn't enough room on the ship to take him with me. So, I had to kill him to keep from squealing. He's probably still locked up in that freezer. - Right. Well, then I'll see you at nine then. - [Trent] I'll be there. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - [Police Radio] Officer Jones come in Officer Jones - Yeah, this is Rick. Let me speak to the captain. - [Captain] What's up, Rick? - Trent's already been here. - [Captain] Where's Officer Jones? - Trent killed him. - [Captain] We've got a description of Trent from a guy he came in contact with in an alley in sector 9. This guy was stabbed really bad and his friend was shot dead. But he still gave us a description. He's wearing dark pants with a black trench coat and possibly dark sunglasses. And get this, he's armed with an MK2 semi automatic handgun and nine-inch blade. - Shit! He knows where she works! (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (elevator beeps) - I don't know if I can take it anymore, Barbara. Every fucking day he's putting his hands all over me. Tell him I've got a boyfriend. - He knows you're not dating anybody right now. - Besides, I don't think it would matter to him anyways. - Just walk into his office, tell him if he doesn't stop bothering you, you're gonna quit. - [Julie] Well, I don't know if I can do that. I really need this job. - What are you gonna do? - Leonard! I did three years cuz of you! - Thought you had four. - I did! They let me out for good behavior. Now it's payback time! - Come on, punk! (garbage truck machinery whirring) (phone ringing) (typewriter keys tapping) - Can I help you? - [Trent] I'm looking for Julie Meyers. - Who are you? - A close friend. - Did she tell you about me? Her and I are together. - Where is she? - She took the day off. Hey, Julie's staying at my house. I'll tell her you came by. - [Trent] Where do you live? - [Boss] None of your goddamn business! (Boss groans) What'd you do that for? - [Trent] None of your goddamn business! (typewriter keys tapping) (phone rings) (Julie screams) - [Police Radio] We have a lookout for a male Caucasian, 25 to 30, considered armed and dangerous. (suspenseful music) - Do we have a description of the subject? - [Radio] He's wearing black pants with a green army jacket. (gun shoots rapidly) (phone rings) (Julie screams) (gun shoots rapidly) - [Julie] Go! - [Barbara] Julie, who the hell is that guy? - He's the guy I testified against in court! He's gonna kill us! We gotta get out of here! (screams) Barbara! No! (guns shoots rapidly) (gun shoots rapidly) (phone rings) (suspenseful music) (gun shoots rapidly) (gun shoots rapidly) (gun shoot rapidly) (gun shoots rapidly) (gun shoots rapidly) (gun shoots rapidly) - [Captain] How you doing, Julie? - I'm okay. - [Captain] And you Rick? - [Rick] Like hell. - We're gonna take you to the safe house tomorrow. And you will stay there until we apprehend this maniac. - [Julie] Wait a minute, could you please tell me what is going on here? And why is this guy not in prison? - He escaped. - [Julie] He escaped? And they told me they were taking him to the maximum security place on Mars. - [Captain] We did, but he escaped. - [Julie] Well, how do you escape from Mars? - This guy is smart. He knows how the systems work. - [Julie] What do you mean? - He got himself put in solitary confinement on purpose. This way nobody would notice his disappearance for five days. He killed a guard before he went in and stole his uniform. Luckily, someone checked in on the guard, but it was too late. By the time we checked the cargo ship, he was already on the streets. - So, what are you gonna do? I mean, what's gonna happen now? - [Rick] We're gonna take him off the streets. - [Captan] You're going to stay with Rick tonight. You will be safest there. Tomorrow morning, he will take you to the safe house where you will stay until we capture him. - [Julie] And if he escapes again? - [Captain] Not a chance. (police siren blaring) (aquariums bubbling) - [Man] Hey, what do you think you're doing, huh? - I'm looking for Ivan. - Who the hell are you? - Trent. - [Man] He told me you'd be coming. Follow me. Yo, Ivan really wanted to be here in person, but he got called out on business. You know how Ivan is. - [Trent] Yeah, I know how Ivan is. - So how'd you escape? - That's not important. I need weapons. I need a lot of power. - So, who's your target? - Fucking cop and the bitch that testified against me. - [Man] In here, AS60. That'll got through anything that's bulletproof. - [Trent] I need a handgun, too. - This is a K40. That'll take care of any of your other problems. - [Trent] I need plenty of ammo. I won't be coming back. - I'll tell you what. Take this whole box. You'll be able to take out the entire police department. You know, and since you're such a good friend of Ivan's, I'm gonna make you a special deal on that. It's on sale for only 300 credits. - Wrong, it's on sale for nothing. (gun fires rapidly) (elevator beeps) - So, this is where you live? - Yeah, this is what I consider home. (elevator beeps) - You live here by yourself? - Just me. I like it better that way. People are just so hard to live with. - Yeah, I know what you mean. (elevator beeps) (police siren blaring) - Here you go. - Thanks. - [Rick] Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm alright. (Rick sighs) What happened? - Oh, it's nothing. - [Julie] So, how long have you been doing this? - [Rick] Doing what? - [Julie] Tracking down guys like Trent. So, what are you gonna do when this mess is all over? - (sighs) I'd like to leave this place. Leave the city. - [Julie] Where will you go? - [Rick] I don't know. Anywhere out of this city. - [Julie] The captain says you're the best LA's got. That you know the streets better than anyone else. Is that true? (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (train horn blows) (screams drowned out by train) - Is this you? I'm sure your parents are very proud. Why aren't your parents in any of these pictures with you? - They were killed when I was eight. - [Julie] What happened? - My father was a detective on the south side. He was tracking the Chang family mafia for three years. He finally got on the inside. Brought down the main dealer. A few days later, they shot my parents coming out of a restaurant. - [Julie] Is that why you became a cop? To avenge your parents? - Something like that. - Rick... Why do you think this Trent guys wants to kill me so bad? - He doesn't think like us, he has only one mission in life. - [Julie] And what's that? - To kill. Fortunately, you stopped him. If it wasn't for your eye witness, we may not have caught him. - Well, it took a lot out of me to stand up there on that stand and point him out to the jury. But I thought of all the victims this guy killed and how their families must have felt. I knew it was the right thing to do. - [Rick] It's not easy. More people need to realize that without their testimonies, these creeps will walk free. - Rick, I wanna thank you for saving my life. - [Rick] It's just part of my job. - No, I feel safe with you Rick. Comfortable. You know, I could really use a hot bath right now. Do you mind if I... - Sure, it's all yours. - Thanks, Rick. - [Television] The President visited the Red Rock Facility on Mars today. Where he talked about new developments for further funding for the controversial prison. Protests come from civil rights groups saying that the use of slave labor is unconstitutional and unjust. In other news today, new engineers at Ropotronics have just unveiled their second version of their MR2 robotic fighter pilot. (police siren blaring) (Trent breathing heavily) (Trent breathing heavily) - [Juror] We the jury of the seventh sector find the defendant, Trent McKormick, guilty on all 11 counts of first degree murder. - [Judge] I sentence the defendant to life in prison with not chance of parole. You'll be sent to the new Red Rock penitentiary on Mars. There you will serve your sentence. Case closed. - [Trent] I'm going to find you. And I'm going to kill you. (Julie breathing anxiously) - [Julie] He's out there. Somewhere. - [Rick] I'll find him. - Before he finds me? - [Rick] Yeah. - [Julie] I guess I'm not the first woman in your apartment. Thanks. - [Rick] That's my ex-wife's stuff. I just feel weird about throwing it away. - [Julie] Where is she? - She left, couldn't handle being a cop's wife anymore. She needed change. At the time, I wasn't ready to change. - And what about now? - [Rick] Maybe. Let me get you another drink. - [Julie] Did I do something wrong? - [Rick] It's just me. - Well, if I did something wrong, I'm sorry. (Rick sighs) What are you doing? - [Rick] I'm leaving. - What, where are you going? - I gotta follow up on some leads. - [Julie] Rick, please don't leave me. - Here take this. Just in case. - You come back, soon? (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (doorbell dings) - [Rick] Hey Tony, come here! I wanna talk to you. (chase music) - [Tony] Hey! - [Rick] That's better. Now where's Trent McKormick? - [Tony] Trent? I don't know any fucking Trent McKormick! Okay, okay, he's staying at Frank's Auto Parts, the salvage yard over on, uh, on-- - [Rick] On Olympic? - Yeah, yeah, that's the one. Yeah, yeah, he's staying in a little back room. He's looking for some chick named Julie Meyers. - [Rick] That wasn't so bad now, was it? - [Tony] Thanks, Rick! (group of people talking) (group of people talking) (group of people talking) - [Rick] I'll take it. - [Bartender] What'll you have? - [Rick] Coffee. (group of people talking) - [Bartender] Here. (group of people talking) (group of people talking) - [Man] Rick! - [Rick] Doug. - [Doug] Didn't expect to find you here. - [Rick] Yeah well, it's been a long night. Just ran into Tony over at Chang's Market. - Tony Richards? - [Rick] Yeah. - What's that snitch up to? Last I heard, Chin mafia had him at the top of their hit list. - [Rick] I had to talk to him. Had to get some information about Trent. He said he was staying over behind Frank's Auto Salvage over on Olympic. - [Doug] You think he's telling the truth? - I don't know, but I'm gonna check it out anyway. - [Doug] This whole Trent McKormick thing has got the captain on edge. Seeing it was so hard in catching this guy the first time. The captain also said something about the warden at Red Rock doesn't want Trent killed. He wants him brought back alive. - [Rick] Yeah well, that may not happen. - [Doug] Well, what do you mean? - [Rick] I mean if I get a chance to smoke this guy, I will. - [Doug] If you do find Trent, let's hope you don't run out of ammo. I'd hate to have to take this guy on one-on-one. - [Rick] I know what you mean. - [Doug] The captain says that Julie Meyers is staying with you. Is that true? She's a nice girl. She's been through a lot. - [Rick] Yeah, it's gotta be pretty scary having this psycho back on earth. - [Doug] I'd be pretty scared too if Trent McKormick were after me. - [Rick] He's going down tonight. I'm gonna find this fucker, and send him straight to hell. - [Doug] But what about what the warden said? - Fuck the warden! It's no longer a case, it's personal. I'm not gonna let this guy get away from me again. - [Doug] Well, be careful Rick. Seen how many people this guy's killed already. - [Rick] What? Who? - [Doug] Guess you haven't been watching the news. He killed one guy in an alley around sector four. His friend was stabbed really bad. Still alive as long as no one unplugs him. I guess he messed with the wrong detective. - [Rick] Who else? - He also killed three people over at Tec Ross Enterprises. - [Rick] I as there earlier today. - [Doug] At Tec Ross? - Yeah, that's where I got in my confrontation with Trent. - [KD] Yo Trent, this is KD. You know that cop that you're looking for? I think his name is Rick Castle. Yeah, he's here. - [Trent] Is there anyone with him? - Yeah, some big black cop that busted me a long time ago. I think his name is Doug. - What's he look like? - Pretty big, leather jacket. - Is there anyone else there with them? - [KD] No, it's just the two of them. - Perfect, I'll be right there! - [Rick] He probably wanted to keep the media from finding out we were looking for him. - [Doug] Yeah, imagine the panic LA would be in again, and how the department would be ripped apart. - [Rick] Well, I'm not gonna let that happen. - [Doug] Sure you won't, Rick. - [Rick] It's time to follow up on this lead. See if Tony's telling the truth. - [Doug] And if this lead doesn't pan out? - [Captain] Rick, we found out where Trent is staying. Or at least someone fitting his description. The eye witness works next door. - [Rick] Well, what do you want me to do? - [Captain] I want you to go over there and investigate. - [Rick] Well, where's this place at? - [Captain] He's staying at the back of Jack's Salvage Yard. It's on Olympic Boulevard in sector nine. - [Rick] On my way, I'll be there in 10. - [Captain] Be careful, Rick. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - [Trent] Where the fuck is Julie Meyers? Where the fuck is Julie Meyers? - [Doug] Fuck you, Trent! - [Trent] Lock the door, Doug! There's no way out. Where the fuck is Julie Meyers? (Doug's neck snaps) - Yeah. Julie. I'm in a salvage yard over in sector nine off Olympic. (ambulance sirens blaring) Yeah, I'm alright. Couldn't find Trent, don't know where he's at. - [Trent] Where the fuck is Julie, Rick? (gun fires) (thunder crashes) (heavy rain pattering) (Trent screams) (heavy rain pattering) (thunder rolling) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - [Trent] Rick, are you afraid to die? (thunder crashes) You're going to have to tell me where Julie is, Rick. Or I'm gonna have to kill you. I can see you, Rick! (gun fires repeatedly) Do you like Julie, Rick? Is she your girlfriend? (gun fires repeatedly) (thunder crashes) Rick, does Julie know she has a man who can't protect her? (police sirens blaring) (heavy rain pattering) (thunder rolling) (thunder rolling) (police sirens blaring) (thunder crashes) (heavy rain pattering) (thunder rolling and crashing) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (heavy rain pattering) (thunder crashes) - [Trent] Where the fuck is Julie, Rick? I'm gonna ask you one more time, fucker! Where is Julie? - You're gonna have to kill me, Trent. - [Trent] Talk, to da! (gun fires) (thunder crashes) (Rick breathing heavily) - [Rick] It's over, he's gone for good. - [Julie] Are you alright? - [Rick] Yeah, I'm alright. Let's go.
