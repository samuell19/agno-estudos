We have a 9-2-7, Denver and Springfield Street. David 32-73, what is your ETA for the 9-2-7? I don't know. Roll a couple of oars and secure the location. David 32-73, roger out. - You can drive down there. - I’m already walking. Where is it? On the infill. - A guy from L.A. has just gone down there. - He has? - Yes, sir. - What's he doing here? Well, he was waiting for you. He waited a while. He decided to go down and take a look for himself. - Ah. - Hope that's okay. Damn right, it's okay. With a bit of luck, I'm going home. - What have we got? - Derelict. They out his throat. - Who are you? - Trimble. - Where do you fit in, Trimble? - His father's the manager, sir. He was shooting vermin and he found the body. Get ready, because I'm telling you, you're in for a shock. They slit him from ear to ear. Want me to make a statement? Not right now. No, thank you. - Did you bring it with you? - Hope I'm not intruding. - Be my guest. What do you got? - Old guy offed himself with a knife. - Can't find the knife. - They out his throat. Would you get behind the tape... ...and tell your father to put that fire out? That ain't legal. I wonder what would make him do a thing like that. - Don't annoy me, Travis. - No, sir. - So where's the knife? - I don't know. I guess that dozer must have shifted him. You're going to need some hands up here to look. You heard. Look for the knife. You too! Move that ass! - You do the pockets? - No, sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a tourist. Welcome to Eureka. How long has he been feeling like this? Week or two. Must have been on the kerosene. Stinks like a diesel engine. - Mr. Blattis of our local newspaper. - Hey. - You sure it's a suicide? - Yeah. This is well rehearsed. - What does that mean? - Cut your own throat, you're nervous about it. You tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck... ...before he worked up the courage for the big one. - Got a dead dog here, sergeant! - Find the knife! Venables, has the coroner called? Yes, sir! He's delayed! All right, gentlemen. I'm out of here. I'll catch you later, Freddy T. How does anyone dead as this lose a knife? What about that kid, Ross? Oh, shit. Of course. The kid. Travis! Find that kid and get the knife off him! He's gonna lie to you, but he's got it, so get it. Well, go on! Get on with it! What are you staring at? I think I found something horrible, sir. - What do you mean "horrible"? - I think I found a hand. You're right. It's a fucking hand. What do you think? I think you're here all day. How much longer are we here? We ain't gonna find nothing else. Give it another hour. The photographer do the dogs? 509s? There's two dogs. He should do the dogs. Got a brassiere here, sergeant! - Looks like it could be blood! - All right. I'm coming. Ah, shit. The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict! Yeah. He can go. I think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'm gonna get out of here. Good to be with you, Ross. Glad you finally made it, bro. - You want some umbrella? - Yeah, thanks. - Give me a hand with this? - Yeah. - Is this normal? - It pisses down October to June. So how long you known Freddy? Ross? He was my sergeant when I was a rookie. Oh, so he got you the job? He would have if he could have. He's tried to get me here long enough. - John. - Hey, chief. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you. Caught in the rain. Right. Thanks a lot. Sergeant Serato, Taylor... ...and Travis, I think you know. - I’ll be with you in one minute. - Do me a favor. Get the rest of the stuff out of the car. Hey, Travis, don't lose it. - Find the knife, sergeant? - No, but we have a theory. Hmm. The kid told me he didn't take it. - Maybe he was lying to you. - Yeah. Well... ls it true you found a hand? Is that it? Interview over, Blattis. Oh, come on, chief. I mean, if it's sensitive, just tell me. I'm not taking notes. We got a body part. We don't know what it is. It's probably some kind of hospital debris. We're gonna try and check it out. - Now you know as much as we do. - Was it male or female? - It was a woman's hand. - Well, I'm grateful for your candor. - Do me a favor, keep this out of the paper. - Mm-hm. That dump serves a dozen communities. We don't know if it's ours. Until we do, I don't want anybody worrying about it. - It wasn't frozen, was it, sergeant? - Come on, Michael. Get out! This guy's trying to move in. I told you what we know. Anything new, you'll be the first to hear about it. Why did he ask if it was frozen? That I couldn't tell you. And don't worry about this crap. By the time you're back, it's gone. - Oh! - Aah! You scared me. Oh, look at you. God, you look good. - Do a rush on three pizzas. - You look good. I'm not giving him pizza. I haven't seen him in a year. Dinner's another night, darling. This is a drive-by. I got an hour. - Bobby! - Bobby's out. What's the rush? Friday night at city hall. I got a good chance to frighten the fat. - Freddy's new obsession. - Who is? Who? A con person bitch with an ass the size of Africa. - So tonight she confesses? - Tonight I feel lucky. - Not for me. - What do you mean? I opened it for you. - It's French champagne. - It's not. It's Californian. - Even better. - Give me a diet soda. I'm on a diet. - Since when do you drink diet soda? - Since he started looking so good. Shh. Don't pay attention to him, John. You look great. - How's your house? - It's okay. What does that mean? - Not too good in daylight. - Ha, ha. Just shut your eyes till it's painted. You're gonna love it. - This is God's country, John. - So I hear. Hi, this is Mike Blattis, Eureka News. I'm not in the office right now-- Can somebody drop these off for me? - Sure. I'll take care of it. - Good. Thanks. Mm-hm. - Are you winning, sergeant? - Yeah. You know something strange about that hand? I think it was frozen. Frozen? Yeah. What does that mean to you? Hey. How you doing? Hey. Come on, Venables, you're a policeman, and a policeman always has an answer. - Well, sir... - Well, what? We had a real bad murder here a couple years ago... ...not actually in our county but south of here. Girl with no head and no hands. - You didn't read about it? - No. Well, it was big shit. Forty or 50 detectives working it never identified her. Never found the head and never found the hands. So could be some crazy stored the hand in a freezer... ...and only now decided to get rid of it. Where do I find a file on that? In there, if you got anything. It'd be under John Taylor's name. I believe the code is Jennifer. Hey, was it really frozen, sergeant? No. Been dead two weeks. - Notice anything weird about it? - No. Look. One, two, three... ...four, five... ...six, seven, this long one, eight... ...nine, 10. I count 11 scars on this hand. And there's four in there that might be. Now, I count them on my hand, I have five. I'm 37 years old. This girl's about 18. How come she has so many scars? I don't know. That's the question. So why don't you tell me about Jennifer? - You know I'm going to find out. - It's an unsolved. They spent about $500,000 and bought themselves a dead end. You might wanna check with Taylor. He worked the case. - I did. What's his problem? - This. He thinks you stole his promotion. What exactly are you doing there, John? It's a method of quitting smoking. That's an interesting method. It must help beat the withdrawal. It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs. Throw one cigarette away. Smoke 59. On day two, you throw two out. You smoke 58. Why don't you throw them all away and smoke none? - Because it's a ritual. You gotta go through it. - You want my advice? - Maybe. - Find yourself a farmer's daughter... ...with nice big fucking tits and shake that bye-bye. Send it to Sacramento, John. I sniff grief. Oh-ho! Whoa! John. - You're done except for the floor. - Thanks, Margie. You're a saint. Honey. Mwah. Don't forget the wagon, okay? - Come on, Bobby, help me with this. - All right. - I’m dying. - Okay, let's go. Let's go. Oh. All right. That's it. I'm fucked. You gotta stop smoking. If I can do it, you can. How'd you do it, old man? Somebody bet me a dollar. A dollar? It's not worth quitting for a dollar. All right. I'll bet you $50. - Fifty dollars? - Mm-hm. You got a bet. J.B., Ronzo. You know that brassiere you sent me? I got some results for you. First, the blood on the bra is human... ...and it's not a popular brand, AB-neg, and that's a rare one. Two, the blood on the brassiere is compatible with the blood from the hand. And three, if you need anything else... ...the official answer from all of us Christians down here in Los Angeles is "fuck off." Hey, shoot me a duck, would you? Bye. What are you gonna do now, soldier? Gonna dig up Jennifer. - What is that? - A laser enhancement of the fingertip. It's really bothering me. You see these striations right here? It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger. Rubbing it. Rubbing it. Rubbing it with her thumbnail or something. Almost identical to Jennifer: slim, white, same age, bra size is even the same. - It's a nicely made lady. - How do you know her hair is black? Hair on her hand. Plus, Jennifer had raven-black hair. What's with all this Jennifer stuff? These cases aren't connected. Yes, they are. I think they may be. I think Jennifer and this lady... ...got hit by the same guy. I have, uh, four points of positive comparison on the cut. Yeah? Well, that's all very interesting. But where's the body? I don't know much about this Jennifer girl except what some of the guys have told me. The principal feature of the case was a gruesome display of the body. He wanted it found. If this is the same guy... ...why has he hidden this one? Just wondered if you'd had time to get around to my pharmacy stuff. You'll have it in the morning. I'll try again tomorrow. Chief. You're probably making him antsy, seeing this back on the wall. - I thought it was Taylor's case. - It sucked in officers... ...from all over the county. It was the worst six months this station ever had. Why don't you give it a minute? Stop by my office. We should talk. So, what does he think it is? - Everything it isn't. - Make a left. He even tried self-inflicted. - It's possible. - Give me a break. It's the garage at the far corner. - You can't stop it, can you? - What? The worrying. The clicking. The picking. You might as well be back in Los Angeles. Why don't you dump it, mail it off? Give it to the fucking FBI, a present. Stay here. It might not be finished yet. Ross! Ross! I just got this insane idea. If I'm wrong, I'll take a week off... ...and redecorate the entire house. She's blind. That's why all the scars. Hear that traffic light? That noise is to help blind people. That's why she has marks on her fingertips. This lady reads in Braille. - Who's next? - Amber Stone. This one's 19 years old. Last seen six weeks ago. Is this the last one? No. One more to go. Welcome to Shasta Trinity Institute. Reception is through double doors and to your right. What exactly is your interest in Amber? I'm afraid I can't give you an answer to that, Mr. Goodridge. As I explained to your secretary, we're doing a lot of looking. We're not even sure it's Amber we're looking for. What is it you're hoping I'm going to do, dissuade or persuade you? I was hoping since we spoke, you'd remember something... ...that might give us an idea where she is. Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, sergeant. What I said on the phone is exactly what I'm saying now. I have no idea where Amber is or who it was took her there. And I might add, in another five weeks... ...150 students will be leaving here... ...driving away on holiday with people whose names I won't know either. Excuse me. You have an appointment with Miss Robertson? Yes, sir. Apparently she saw Amber the weekend she left... ...and was briefly in the room with the man she left with. I see. Well, she teaches another class at 4:00. I'd appreciate it if you don't detain her. How come this place is so big? - Where is everyone? - I don't know. He said this was the staff side of the building. Here we go. What did you think of that fucking idiot? He had a handshake like a partially excited penis. Hi. Sergeants John Berlin and Frederick Ross. We have an appointment. What do you want to ask, Mr. Berlin? - Please sit down. - Oh. Ahem. Thank you. Uh, I'd like you to tell me in any way you like... ...what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber... ...on the afternoon she left. Well, I think I told you on the phone. I went up to her room to say goodbye... ...and we sat on the bed and chatted a while... ...while a friend was coming in and out collecting her things. What kind of friend? Was it a boyfriend? - Old friend? New friend? - I don't know. - Any idea what this fellow was like? - No. - Know how old he was? - No. All right, let me put it to you this way. How old do you think I am? Twenty-six, 39 or 53? Fifty-three. You must have some idea about him. When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blond? - No. - Why not? You heard my voice. We don't have some kind of sixth sense, you know... ...except in ridiculous novels. If I hadn't have known, I would have thought he was blind. - Blind? Why? - Because he was comfortable with us. - He shook hands like blind people do. - How's that? - Blind people often use both hands. - And he did that? Yes. He used breath freshener. I think his name was John. John. You never mentioned that on the phone. - What makes you think his name was John? - She must have called him John. I don't know. I'm making some tea. Would you like some? Uh, sure. I think we got something. Thank Christ, we got a witness. Just give me a little time. She might remember something. Come on, she's blind, bro. You'd be better off talking to one of these Beethoven guys here. This is fucking crazy. Two hours here and two hours back, and all I got is "John." You said he spoke. Can you remember what he said? Well, he just said, "Come on, hurry up, will you? It's starting to snow again." And I remember he was a little breathless from carrying the cases... ...because the elevator had gone out. The elevator wasn't working? No, it has a mind of its own. It's 4:00 p.m. - Well... - May I see your hands? - My hands? - Yes. I have a class, you know. I have to go. Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him? Or her? - It doesn't matter how small. - No. Except he smoked, like you. - Me? - Yes. I could smell it on his breath... ...like I can smell it on yours. I have a class. I'm late. Do you have a dog, a seeing-eye dog? No. There's a lot of scratch marks on your door. Sometimes I look after friends' dogs if they go to dances. Sergeant, can I just refer you to this memo here? - Did Amber have a dog? - Yes. What color was it? I don't know. If she writes or calls or anything at all... ...you'll let me know, okay? I'll leave a number with the office. Fifty fucking dollars, okay? What exactly do you teach, Helena? Music composition and cello. Fifty of them, and I want them now. You are now on the fourth floor. Amber had a seeing-eye dog since she was 18. I knew there was something about that Labrador. That dog was too good to be dead. We'd better get back up to that dump. No way. Not me, mister. I'm not going back up there. You might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll. We're going. Get that light down here. In that bag there, you'll find a knife and a pair of long-nosed pliers. Looks like a .22. Jesus, he said six. I want you to come see Citrine with me. He ain't gonna hear from me, but I know he'll listen to you. Listen to me say what? I want to take the blind institute to pieces. I want every address book... ...every phone call, everybody in and out of there in the last five years. - For a dead dog? - It's a major series. This girl's not the second victim. She's Jennifer 8. I'm going to see Citrine this afternoon. You gonna come? No, you're not. He's out of town. Hey. You believe me, don't you? What does it matter what I believe? What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes... ...but I can't help you with this. I'm sorry, brother. You're on your own. Is anyone there? Yes. It's John. John Berlin. Have you been here long? Just a minute or two. I knocked on your door. No one home. I followed the music. I'm sorry. Um, let me get my things. It's not a problem. I'm not in a hurry. Matter of fact, I saw this little restaurant place down the road... ...and it was kind of pretty. I thought maybe we could have some lunch. Whatever. Was someone here with you? Uh, when I came in, the door was flapping. I don't think so. No one comes here on the weekends. I suppose I'm the worst witness you ever had. Well, I gotta admit, you are one of them. I just wish I knew what kind of vehicle you were talking about. Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin. This kind of car sounded hollow. Maybe it was a foreign car. Our kind of cars sound fat. Are you sure you want to see it? It's another three floors up. Yes. How often does it break down? Oh, all the time. They keep on threatening to fix it, but they never will. I sat right there on the bed. If I came to the diner with you... ...would you bring me back? Of course I would. What are you staring at? Sorry. That's all right. It's just you suddenly reminded me of him. He was standing right where you are. Kind of breathless like you. I'll go get my coat. I'll wait for you downstairs. I couldn't take another minute of Los Angeles. I felt like I'd said sorry in every street in the city. I'll tell you what. If I promise to stop being a cop, will you promise to stop being a witness? We don't have to sit here and wait for me to ask questions. You can ask a question too. - Are you wearing a uniform? - No. Oh. I'm glad we got the conversational side of lunch over with. I'm sorry. I don't like to sit in the middle of a restaurant. - Why? - I feel like everyone's looking at me. There's nobody looking at you. There's hardly anybody here. The only person looking at you is me. Are you married? Was. I don't like to talk about it. - You just asked me to ask you questions. - I know. You just happened to pick the one time in my life I'd like not to remember. I was in the badlands, Helena, really not well. It's the thing that happens to a lot of cops. We don't wanna talk about that. Thoughts that lie too deep for tears. Hmm. Yeah. That will do. ls that Hamlet? No. It's Wordsworth. Do you like poetry? Do you like poetry? I don't know. I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kind of thing. But you DEW- - Pray? - You said you were in the badlands. No, I don't pray. I had a dream once about God. It was about the time I was getting well... ...and he was a nasty-looking little guy... ...and he moved into the apartment right on top of me. And I said to him, "Hey, don't you listen to people's prayers?" He said, "Prayers? Not often. They're junk mail." You're pushing this too hard. It's like you want me to say stop. You must know that's the way this is going. We've got other cases. Why don't you ease up a little? Because this is a major, chief. We're closer to this guy than anyone's ever been. Then where's the body? Where's the body and why has he hidden it? He hasn't hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before. He never read a weather forecast. She's probably 15 feet from the highway... -...three feet under the snow. - Got a match on the bullet? - No. - Got a print from the hand? - No, sir. - Could be anyone's hand. Illegally disposed-of hospital debris. It's her hand. It's her scar. It's her dog. Her dog's been shot, and she's missing. She's not missing. Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? No. She left of her own free will. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. I love to paint. It's not great art, but I switch the colors. - If you're not gonna hear me-- - I have heard you. You just don't like hearing me. You've got this whole damn thing out of proportion. I don't know what you've gotten used to in Los Angeles... ...but I don't believe there is a police chief that'd put together a task force... -...for a body part. - We have a multiple homicide. We have a body part under suspicious circumstances... ...a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere, and a bill for $17 for its wig. When you just give love And never get love You know the great joy of fishing? You don't have to think. Just you and the mackerel and nothing in between but God. I'm thinking about the old bum at the dump. Naturally you are. It's a beautiful day. The sun's coming out. Barbecued chicken. - What else would you think about? - He was murdered, Ross. He was also cremated. Tell me about it. I made a serious error. I think he ran into the guy... ...and whoever took him out knew how to fake it. Here they come. Throw it high, high in the air. There you go. Why is she blind, Berlin? Had a car accident at 14. Her entire family was wiped out. No shit. Such a shame. She's a really sweet kid. She's a doll... ...but I wish he hadn't brought her out here. Rule one is don't diddle around with a witness. Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne. Well, that's who she is... ...except she can't run away. I really like Margie. She likes you. Have you known her long? She's my, uh, big little sister. She doesn't sound like you. She kind of adopted me. How come you never ask me what I'm like? I know what you're like. Yeah, how do you know what I'm like? Ross told me. Oh, yeah? What did he say? He said you were quite chubby and you have a nervous tic. What else did he say? Just your age. Oh, yeah? How old did he say I was? Fifty-seven. I don't mind. Okay. - What's the matter? - That was like the hollow car. A Volkswagen van. You sure? Her dog was barking all the time. It didn't like him. He said, "Put that thing in the back." Then I heard a door slam and the van drove away. Why were you out here? Because I wanted to feel the snow on my face. I love the snow and the rain. What are you doing, mister? Uh... We're having a lot of vehicle robberies. Your door was open. Can I see your driver's license? Yeah. I saw you come out of the institute. You up there a lot? Oh, that was you who nearly ran into me. No, that was you who nearly ran into me. You up there a lot? Uh, my mother and I run an arts-and-crafts center... ...and we buy a lot of stuff from the institutes. - Where's your store, Amanda? - Oakland. Oakland. Well, on your next stop... ...make sure that door's locked. Merry Christmas. Miss Robertson may appear mature... ...but let me assure you, she isn't, not even by her own perceptions. If she could look in a mirror, she'd expect to see a child of 14. I don't wish to be indelicate, Mr. Citrine... ...but I think you understand what I'm saying. Investigation of a possible homicide is never easy... ...and I hope you're not suggesting any impropriety... ...on the part of my officer. Having said that... ...this department has no further interest in Miss Robertson. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Citrine. I appreciate it. Okay, chief. Just hear me out. I have a vehicle, and I have a name. - What name? - John. - What's the vehicle? - It's a Volkswagen van. A John and a van. You'll be knocking on doors all over the state. - Just give me one more month. - No. Finito, maestro. You're closed. And don't kid yourself it's got anything to do with him. This thing was over anyway. I'm sorry. I know this means something to you... ...but I don't want you up at that institute again. I'm flat-out about that. Here. Goodridge got it from Amber. It's a postcard. Apparently she's alive and well and living in Oakland. She's dead, chief. Then that's a very unique souvenir. Can I buy you a beer, sergeant? Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me, Travis. But just this once, I'll have a mic. How are you doing? - Three mics, Susie. - Couple of shots. Ah. Look at those amazingly bosoms. - Want another beer? - No. - Gotta go. I'm nights. - Give me a ride? Sure. How's that hand job coming along, John? We're not talking to talk tonight. No one's gonna make that dude. Six months investigation, the nearest we got... ...we thought he was a sailor. A sailor? Yeah. In and out of Frisco on the big boats. Every lead we had went right out to sea. Night-night, Freddy T., John. How come he's suddenly so forthcoming? I'd like to kick him in the fucking ass. If he would've discussed it with me, maybe I would've gotten somewhere. - I never heard about the sailor theory before. - You're closed. He might have that one thing-- Have a fucking lemonade or something. Let it go. What are you looking for? Vehicle references. Wrong cabinet. I have a link with a series in San Diego and half a VW van. I figured you might have the other piece. No. Hey, what's happening? Sergeant Berlin's doing a little in-house investigation. I wish you'd fucking shout at me. What's the matter with you. You got some kind of obsession? Do the job you're paid for. There's work all the way up the corridor. If our stuffs too dull, why don't you go back to L.A.? Because I'm gonna be here when Jennifer 8 turn up. In the spring, she's gonna be coming through the snow. When that happens, I'm gonna find the man who killed her. Then I'll go back to Los Angeles. When you're finished in here, I've got a report to type up. Maybe you'll let me know. You really are the working part of an asshole, Berlin. I didn't intend to come today. I'm not supposed to be here. Why? It's in Braille. It's from Amber? It's dated a week ago. "Dear Mr. Goodridge, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to say goodbye... ...so just a line to say all is well. I'm looking for a job and an apartment to go with it. Love to all who love me. Amber." I don't think Amber wrote this. Why not? Amber wasn't very good at Braille. She couldn't have written it. She couldn't even have read it. - Did you see this? - What? You out of your mind with this? Huh? Anything happens to that girl, I'm gonna break your fucking back. Easy on the words you're putting in my face, sergeant. What's going on? His blind friend got attacked. Angelo went up there. - Somehow it got itself in the paper. - Not somehow. You put it there. I may have said something. I don't recall. Don't lie to me. I got off the phone with Blattis asking for a comment. - You gave him the whole case. - I gave him the case. The case is closed. So what? So read it. You just hung a target around her neck. Bullshit, pal. Don't you know anything? This guy reads the newspapers. He collects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? He's reading Helena Robertson's name like she's some witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you sat down and tried. Come on, country boys, let's all step up and hear the expert. - Just walk away, Taylor. - You think you're the only guy... ...ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I busted the clock on Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll ever know. That's how I know it ain't him. - You're investigating a soap opera. - Stop this now. He tells her bye-bye, and she gets attacked. Well, give me a fucking break. There is no serial killer. You stick her name up in neon... ...and there's still no serial killer. I ain't the only one saying it. Everybody in this building is saying it. Everybody. Shut up. Come on, Freddy. Let's have this out and over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case because you found a nice piece of ass. And hey. No one is blaming you for it. I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't you come in here getting holy over us. Yeah, I put it in the paper... ...because I wanted to stop this bullshit. It's pissing everyone off. You don't know what you've done, Taylor. If your friend from San Diego was up here... ...and thought for one out of two seconds that she was a danger to him... ...he would've taken her out weeks ago. Why don't you get yourself a dictionary and look up the word "witness"? I know what a witness is. Her it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blond-- I'll do something you never did, Taylor. I'm gonna catch this bastard, and when I do, he's gonna find out... ...how good a witness she really is. Meanwhile, you better be aware of me... ...because I wish you ill. I told you what would happen, and it's happened. Goodbye, princess, and that same night, she gets attacked. That's a tough one to swallow. I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion. You don't really believe this. One hundred fucking percent I believe it. - You know why? - Why? Because I never told her goodbye. Okay? - Is that good enough for the committee? - I didn't know that. No, you didn't know that. You left your booze in here. Who do you think it was? - You think it was him? - That is a very stupid question. - Well, I'm asking it. - How the hell do I know who? Some jerk-off, some Peeping Tom prick. Definitely not him. This guy's in the trade. He ain't gonna stand there and look at her ass. - If he's in the room with her, she's dead! - Ease off, John. I'm sick of this toy-town shit! Everything you say sounds reasonable... ...but there's a reasonable explanation for the opposite. Don't give me that. Not another word of that! There is a bad man out there. I don't know if he's in the next room or the next state... ...and I don't know what his trigger is, but if he reads her name in that newspaper... ...I believe he'll be inclined to do something about it. I got a bad feeling about this. And I've been doing this too long to be wrong. I don't want you to worry about anything, okay? We're gonna find this guy, and everything will be okay. -Okay? -Okay. You want your music on? You're looking worried again, Helena. No, I'm not. You're looking more worried now than when you decided to start worrying. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm going to roast you a chicken with candles around it. Wouldn't it be better if I cook it? You said you can only boil. - Ho-ho-ho. - Hey, hey, hey. From Helena. Sounds like Frank Sinatra. Where are the ladies? Putting on the war paint. Hmm. Can't thank you enough. Don't thank me. Thank Marge. It's her invitation. So far as Citrine is concerned, we keep it that way. Got you. Chivas Regal. - Gentlemen. - Wow. Ta-da! Gentlemen, merry Christmas. - Now turn around. Let's see the whole thing. - No. Go on. - You look so pretty. - Once a year. Christmas. What do you think? Not too much. Just right, huh? She looks so pretty. Well, say something, guys. Wow. Here is the main thing I wanna say I'm busy 24 hours a day I fix broken hearts I know I really can Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come A-come-a Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come A-come-a Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah I got you. Here's my beer, sweetie. Careful. Where the hell have you been? Ah, the duty sergeant fucked up. I'm on tonight. How long you got? One big drink. - Hey, John, did you get my message? - No. I left a message on your machine. It wasn't me calling. - My wife around? - Kitchen. We got a so-called professional cook out there... ...having a nervous breakdown over a turkey. Sure you didn't call? No. I spoke to what's-his-name a couple times but not to her. I've never asked for her. - Who? - Someone's been calling the institute... ...wants to talk to Helena. He says he wants to ask her some questions. Not guilty. Thanks, Angelo. You got a quiet phone somewhere? John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. - It's probably some local cops. - It's just what I wanna find out. Upstairs. And beautiful. There. Good. - Are you sure I look okay? - Oh, are you kidding? You are the prettiest girl at this party by 200 percent. Press your lips together. Mm. Ma, ma, ma. There. Good. Okay, sit down. How are you doing on those heels? They don't mix very well with beer. When did John divorce? Two or three years ago. What was she like? - She was very pretty. - Oh? But a policeman's wife she wasn't... ...so one day, she just packed it and left... ...and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet. What does that mean? It means he crashed, you know? He just couldn't come to terms with it. There he was, every spare minute, running to San Diego... ...having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, coming back. You wouldn't believe the amount that man drank. You think he still loves her? I think he still thinks about her. Not like then. Then it was an obsession. Yes, come in! That woman in the kitchen says if she doesn't get help in 10 seconds, she's gonna resign. Oh, that woman! She's a disaster. Okay, honey, tell her I'll be right there. No, no, no. Wait a minute. Take Helena with you and find John. Don't let go of her hand until you do. Good. Oh, no Said Louie, Louie Oh, baby Said we gotta go All right! Three nights and days I'll just go see if he's upstairs. You stay right here. Think of girl, all constantly On that ship I dream she's there - Excuse me. - Sorry. Louie, Louie Oh, no Hey, Popeye! Fat guy! Ha, ha. You are still the prettiest goddamn cop in this town. Said we gotta go Okay, let's give it to 'em, right now It's me. John. You want me to bring Margie back up here? Could you take me home, please? I just can't walk in these shoes. Although she may not be the girl You don't have to dress like this for me. As pretty to my heart She carries the key Won't you tell her please To put on some speed Follow my lead Oh, how I need It's okay. Someone to watch over me You can't get in there. It's Comanche-proof. Jesus. What are you doing? I suppose I'm drinking myself sober. You got any Glasers? Yeah. Right drawer. Left drawer. -.32s? - Right drawer. - What exactly are you doing, John? - I’m going up to the institute. Now? This cop that's been calling, he thinks she's gonna be there over Christmas. Now, I checked with the locals and our station. No calls, so whoever it is... ...it isn't the police. I think this bastard's getting worried about something. I think there's a chance he might turn up. Well, let's hope he does. And if he does... ...I’m gonna drop a bomb on the fucker. Listen... ...you don't have to come. Hey, watch them working. I'm your partner. What time is it? Where's your watch? Guess it's by the bed. It's 20:03. Isn't she a little young for you, bro? You think if she could see, she'd hang around with an old dog like you? Your stomach's going around to meet itself behind your back. Bullshit. - I’m in my prime, baby. - Bits. Bits. Ha, ha. What do you mean, bits? Policemen's bodies age at different rates. Look at me, I got a belly in its 50s. My balls are in their 60s, and my feet are in their 80s. Hit those wipers. There. See it? See it? Fourth floor? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fucking in there! Let's do it. - What channel? - Local tac. Local? - What if we need a backup? - We're not here. I don't want the desk to hear us. Gotcha. You got nothing but that .32? And my Beretta. This fucking thing's quitting. I'm gonna start at the top and work my way down. - You ain't going alone. - That's a liability. I don't want you hanging on my shirt. Anybody but me comes down... ...take him out, but try to keep him alive. I want this bastard living. - ROSS. - 10-2. I'm going in. You take care, bro. - Ross, you hearing me? -10-2. I'm going upstairs. John, what's happening? I'm on Helena's floor. I'll take a look at her apartment. You Okay? This flashlight's kaput. Door's locked. What's happening, brother? I hear something. Something upstairs. Oh, I've got footsteps right up above me. John, what's happening? You are now on the third floor. Shit! The fucker's in the elevator! Get ready, Ross, he may be coming down! John. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? What's going on? Can you hear me? Goddamn it. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Just be careful, because I'm coming up. Is that you, John? John! Answer me. Now! Or I'll blow this fucking staircase to pieces. It's me, Freddy. What the hell is going on up there, brother? I've been calling 10 minutes. Jesus Christ, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Holy shit, John! John, not you'.! Not you! Get me the police. Quickly! Where's Margie? Taking Bobby to a friend's. He thinks his dad's in the hospital. Why did you go up there, John? John? Right here. Is that Margie? I'm here, darling. I'm right here. Shh. Don't cry, darling. He was a big old cop. He didn't like tears. - Marge-- - Don't. Don't! What are you gonna do about this, little brother? I don't know, Margie. I don't know. Mm-mm. I'm tired now. I'm gonna go to sleep. No. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. I want 24-hour protection on Margie's house. Otherwise, I'm not saying nothing. You give me that, or read me my rights and talk to a lawyer. All right. You got it. I'm putting an observer in there with you. I don't trust the FBI. - I want Serato. - No. Why can't I have Serato? Because I'm short of men... ...and Angelo won't do it. Whoever I got free first, you get. I always figured I'd like to retire to a little town like this. Maybe buy a boat, do some fishing. You fish, John? I have done some. All right. Let's not beat around the bush... ...whatever that may mean, and get right down to it. You don't mind if I jump around a little bit this morning... ...while I'm easing my way into this, do you? You're asking the questions. You had an argument with Ross... ...assaulted one of the officers, right? I wouldn't use the word "assault." - You got a racy temper, sergeant? - Not especially. Something they did on this occasion made you lose your rag? Not they. He. Taylor put a piece in the newspaper... ...which put my witness in jeopardy. From whom? From the man I detailed in my report. He's a crazy man... ...and to my certain knowledge, he has killed eight girls. Not a lot of support for that scenario, though, is there? No, not a lot. Not even from Ross? No. Is that why you lost your temper with him? Frustration. No one believing you. Is that why you were angry with Taylor? You don't like Sergeant Taylor, do you? Like? You wanna use another word? I'm indifferent to Sergeant Taylor. You don't blame him in any way for the situation you find yourself in? His motive for exposing my witness... ...was malicious. - So you don't like him? - No, I don't like him. You... ...Wish him ill? This crazy man, what makes you think... ...he wants to eliminate Miss Robertson? - Did you read my report, sir? - I’m asking a question. He reads in the newspaper that I'm investigating... ...the disappearance of her friend... ...and Miss Robertson becomes the focus of his anxiety. How good of a witness is she? He's a crazy man, but he ain't stupid. He's very intelligent. He's got a flexible M.O... -...and he doesn't wanna get caught. - We'll have plenty of time to discuss... ...your mystery man and his flexibility later. Right now I'd like to talk about the event. Can you turn that thing on? All right, the door comes back... ...hits you, knocks you down, knocks you out. For how long do you figure approximately? One minute? Ten? Okay. Then what happened? Immediately you get up? I saw the flashlight at the bottom of the stairs. Did you check your weapon? Maybe. It would've been instinctive... ...but all I know is I was in possession of it. - You didn't check it? - I don't know. I didn't think of it. - Why not? - I was dazed. You were woozy. Confused. I was unconscious 10 seconds ago. I understand. Then? I went down and grabbed the flashlight... ...and tried to get Ross on the radio. There was nothing. Static. I noticed blood on my hand. My eye was cut. Could you see out of it? Yeah, I could see. I ran, climbed out of the window, went down the fire escape. When I got to the bottom, I found Ross. - Were you breathless? - Sure, I was breathless. When did you realize you were no longer in possession of the .32? When I was in the hospital. You figure you lost it in the hospital or on the way there? I figured it had fallen down the stairwell. - Like the flashlight. - Yes. Were you drinking that night? - It was Christmas Eve. - That wasn't my question. - Yes. - What about Ross? Were you drinking in the car? You had a bottle in the car? I think Ross had a mouthful. - But not you. - I may have had a nip. To keep out the cold. It was very cold that night. Wasn't it very windy? Which hand was the flashlight in'? Left hand. So the Walther was in the right? The Beretta was in the right. You just said you didn't check, so how do you know which gun you were holding? You said you figured it had gone down the stairs with the flashlight. You said you were confused. You pick up the flashlight in confusion. How do you know you didn't pick up the .32? - You playing games with me, Mr. St. Anne? - Games? I told you I lost the Walther. No, you told me you didn't know you lost it until you were in the hospital. If you didn't know it till then, it could've been either weapon. The gun in my right hand was a Beretta. I'd like that note corrected... ...for the record now, please, sir. - Do you want a lawyer, sergeant? - There you go, another game question. Do I want a lawyer? What do I want a lawyer for? - If I've got nothing to hide. - Don't you? You know I don't, so why don't we quit the bullshit and get down to it? What's your angle, Mr. St. Anne? - Where is that little gun, sergeant? - I have no idea. You don't? If it isn't at the institute, the man who killed Ross took it. The man who killed Ross used it. And you don't have any idea where that little .32-caliber Walther's gone? No. All right, sergeant, here it is. I intend to produce evidence that will prove you shot Frederick Ross... ...with malice aforethought. My angle, therefore... ...is to prepare a case on behalf of your chief... ...to prosecute you for first-degree murder. Oh, my God! Why did he have to bring her here? I hate her! I hate her! I hate him. I just want my dad. Could I have the number of a taxi, please? There was a gale that night. All the doors were swinging. So this door comes back and clips you and down you go. Within 35 seconds of unconsciousness, you're on the fire escape... ...and you're confused, really confused. You don't know if Tuesdays come in twos or happen once a week. You see a figure coming up the stairs. Ross ain't meant to be on the stairs. He challenges you. And this ain't a piece of wood with a nail through it. This guy's got a 12-gauge Winchester up your nose. And he's drunk, and you're dizzy... ...and your eye's full of blood. And you ain't thinking good and you're seeing worse... ...and, wow, it just went off. You just put him down. And you get hit by a Glaser, you stay down. But he ain't dead. Now you realize you shot your partner. "Oh, Susanna, how am I gonna get out of this one?" "I know. Serial killer shot him." And now... ...here comes the malice, bro. Seventeen seconds later... ...you put another one in his throat. -Isn't that what happened? - No. Tell me what happened, then. Let me ask you a question before I forget. Do you take medication for that? - For what? - Breathlessness? No. All right, let me answer your question: What is the relevance of the janitor? Why don't I, uh, take you through it from where I'm sitting? At sometime between 2 and 2:30... ...the janitor thought he heard a vehicle approaching through the woods. He looks out, sees nothing. No lights. Nothing. Hmm, figures it must be hunters. Sometime later, he hears a noise. A door, maybe a window slam. He gets up... ...and between 2:30 and a quarter of 3... ...he makes a search with a flashlight... ...of the top three floors. Finding nothing untoward, he goes back to his apartment on the roof. The flashlight you saw was his. The footsteps you heard were his. The elevator you were chasing up and down after was empty. It's prone to such activity due to an electrical fault. Apparently, it happens frequently during gales. The gale that was swinging the door... ...that knocked you down, that confused you so much. And so here we are, back to where I'm sitting. Why don't you tell me what really went on that night? There are two men that know I didn't kill him. One of them is me, and the other is the man that did. Which man is this? We just dealt with the man. John, is that you? You got really fucking lucky, didn't you? Feel my face. I starting getting kind of concerned about you, Jenny. Like how blind are you? As blind as your friend or less blind? Because she could see, you know. She had a view out of one of them. But you... ...you don't see nothing, do you? Nothing at all. But let me tell you, little Jenny, if he ever gets to me, you're dead. That's a promise. Get St. Anne in here for a minute, will you? Give him this. Our blind lady has been attacked again. I guess she's in love with him. She'd try anything. Yeah. I hear I've been nominated as an official observer. - It's either you or Taylor. - He don't wanna do it either. I'll toss a coin for you, but one of you is going in there today. Bullshit or not, you should get a proper statement. That's been done. What do you wanna do with it? Let him have it. I need a friend, Angelo. You got one. She's a bad witness, John. Fucking lousy alibi. Now, I know why you did it, Helena, but you are not helping me. Everything they're hearing from me, they think is a lie. Now here comes a man who I'm desperate to prove exists... ...and what do you know, he turns up in my house and has a chat with you. Nobody in the state of California is gonna believe that. No one believes me. I don't believe me! Don't say that. Don't you dare say that. I believe you. I know you're trying to help, but you just don't understand. Well, then explain it to me. I've got enough darkness, haven't I? The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up in the institute to kill you. He don't wanna kill Ross. He was there to kill you. That's it. That's the truth. I didn't wanna tell you, but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's house... ...because I can no longer protect you here. - Why does he wanna kill me? - He thinks you're a witness. - Then why didn't he kill me? - Stop that, please, will you? - Why didn't he kill me, John? - Will you fucking stop that? I'm not Serato, Helena! Helena, he didn't kill you, because he wasn't here. He's not gonna be in the same room with you and let you live. Kiss me, John. Kiss me. Kiss me again. I love you. Are my lips lying to you? Is my mouth lying to you? He was here. I've been calling 10 minutes. Jesus Christ, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Holy shit, John! John, not you! Not you! Ross switched into channel eight. So we have a recording of the whole incident. John. I could help you. Why don't you tell me the truth? I have told you the truth. That isn't me. - I’ve never called Ross "Freddy" in my life. - I’ve heard you. No, you haven't, and you have absolutely no voice in here... -...so keep your mouth shut. - You tell a lot of lies. Is that something that comes naturally to you? I don't lie. Prepared to lie to your chief? Under exceptional circumstances. What were the circumstances that caused you to lie to Freddy Ross? I've never lied to Ross. - You didn't? - No. Well, he thought you did. He wrote it down here in his book. "Berlin is a liar." It's right there, underlined. It's dated the day you got your first break... ...with your mystery man. You don't know why he wrote that, do you? Uh, maybe he thought there was no mystery man. Maybe he thought your investigation was bullshit. Maybe he thought you were making it up... ...because you wanted to be top cop. Isn't that why you went running up that garbage dump? So everyone could stand in awe of top cop? Huh? Isn't that why you came up here? Because you couldn't make it in L.A.? So you got a pissy little degree... ...you come here so you can be top guy, right? But Ross was top guy, wasn't he? Always would be top guy. And you know what? He did it without even trying. Everybody loved him. He had everything you wanted, didn't he? Great marriage. Great kid. Everything that you couldn't have. And you wanted it all to go away... ...because you had a lousy life with a lousy wife... ...who was fucking everyone, wasn't she? Is that why you need to pick on this little blind girl? Because you can control her. Control who she's fucking. Come on, John. You wanna lose your temper with me? You're good at losing your temper. Come on, lose your temper with me. No way, Mr. St. Anne. You lost your fucking temper with Ross, didn't you? Huh? Why don't you tell me the truth, huh? You got into an argument in the car. You lost your temper with him. You stood over him and blew his fucking larynx out... ...with a Glaser. Where were you aiming, John? Going for the face? Huh? You wanted to blow his fucking face away... ...because you hated him so much. No, I loved that guy. The toughest thing's knowing he thought I killed him. Well, that he did. And that do I, sergeant. What do you take for that breathlessness, sergeant? I don't take anything. How about aminophylline? I don't know what that is. You don't? It's an anti-asthma medication... ...prescribed for breathlessness. Came out of the ashtray of your car. But you don't know what it is? You don't know how it got there? You don't use it for breathlessness? John, I'm running out of questions... ...and you're running out of lies. I'm gonna give you one more chance to take that second-degree... ...and you better do it. I, uh, ahem... I'm going to need some time to think. All right, you think about it... ...but don't you make a fool of me. You come in here with one more lie, I bullshit you not... ...I’m gonna press for the maximum penalty there is. And that's the death penalty, sergeant. Come on, get your things. Come on, let's go. The man who murdered Ross gets asthma. It's not a breath freshener. It's an asthma inhaler. We're going out the door. This capsule came out of the Volkswagen van. I had that van. This guy drove that van. - Okay, Oakland. What? - Arts and crafts. Dan, yeah. Here. You sure? No Amanda with a blue VW. - This is it. Arts and crafts. - I’ve gotta get down there... ...and find that store. John!John. If you find him, I want you to call me. I wanna know his name. The time is 9 p.m. The time is 9 p.m. Taylor. You should not have come to my mother's house! Police spent several hours this morning at Sergeant Berlin's home. Various property was removed, including a .32-caliber Walther pistol... ...the weapon investigators believe to have been used... ...in the slaying of Sergeant Ross. Look, I'm unable to say anything now, except this is a very sad and tragic day. John Berlin lied to us all, lied to me. Much worse, he lied to every man, woman and child in this community. Where was Berlin arrested? At his home in Eureka, 6 a.m. - Who made the arrest? - Sergeant John Taylor. - ls it true he resisted arrest? - I have nothing to add. Oh, he did not arrest me in my house! He hit on me in Oakland! Okay, listen. I'll sign anything, anything you want. I'll sign it. I just want an opportunity to talk to her and Margie. That's all I'm asking. That's my deal. Bring them in. That's my deal, chief. All right, I'll put it to St. Anne. Well, you better put it to him quick, because if you don't, she's dead. Didn't push her down the stairs at their previous meeting, did he? He went up there to plant the fucking gun! He was up there to plant the gun! To plant the gun! Open the door, Travis. Open the door. Open the door, Travis! Travis! He was up there to plant the gun! - Marge? - Oh. It's Sergeant Taylor. Sorry, Margie. Been trying to call. Your line's down. Ahem. Just wanted to let you know that we're taking the guard off today. She going somewhere? You're not gonna try and bail him, are you? I really wouldn't do that, Margie. We found the gun. I know. Do you want me to drive her? - I’m through with my shift. - No. I'm gonna take her. I've got your suitcase. Here's my arm. I'm okay. Taylor was a cop in San Diego. I don't know about the girls there, but he comes up here, he hits another... ...then he spends months feeding false information into Jennifer. Now, let me tell you about this very sick man named John Taylor. Then you can check it through. He grows up in an environment of blind children. His mother's blind, she teaches the blind... ...and he is taking classes with little blind girls... ...and he's a boy, so he's attracted to them. But every time he smiles at them-- Whew, he really don't like you, J.K. They reject him. And these fantasies develop into a rage. He's digging himself some bullshit with this bullshit. Therefore, the more hates them. What is he gonna do to those lousy bitches? He's a little boy. He turns them into little dolls... -...and tears their heads off. - You're right. He really didn't like me. - The only crystal-- - He's out. What? Margie Ross just made his bail. Margie! Margie! Margie! There's no one here. Mom took her back to the institute. What? When? I don't know. How come they let you out? ls Margie with her? Is she with her? No. She came back and went out again. They're all out around here. He'd have to be real crazy to kill her now, wouldn't he? I mean, we're talking real full-blown insane. He is insane. His brain is upside down, but he's very cunning. He's not gonna go after her with a .45 Colt. He'll just push her down the stairs. Say night-night, dead girl. ls it dark yet? No. But it's getting kind of red. I remember red.
