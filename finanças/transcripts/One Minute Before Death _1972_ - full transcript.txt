(static buzzing) (thunder crashing) - [Driver] Are you sure you want me to leave you here? - Why, is there's something wrong? - [Driver] Well, there's some talk that this house is haunted. - Oh, stop that nonsense. Only ignorant people believe that foolishness. (thunder crashing) - Mother! (dramatic music) Mother! - [Mother] What is it? - [Young Woman] I think I saw something over there. - Oh, Lisa, there's nothing there at all. - No, Mother, but really, I did see it. - Now, don't let that driver frighten you into seeing ghosts. You wait here. I'll see if I can find Mrs. Warren. - Please don't take too long. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (woman laughing) (thunder crashing) (Lisa gasps) - [Servant] I'm sorry if I frightened you, miss. - [Mother] Lisa, what's the matter? - Mother, we've gotta get out of this house. I know it's haunted. - Oh, come now, Lisa. What you need now is a good night's rest. Besides, we've no other place to go. - Come, let me take you to your room. - [Mother] My poor brother. What a shock to learn that he died only two months ago in that horrible place. (woman laughing) (eerie music) - There is another bedroom next to this one. - Oh. - No, Mother, please stay with me tonight. - As you wish, madam. - Strange woman. - Oh, I do wish that we could leave tomorrow. - You will feel better after Paul and Regina arrive. As you know, they've also been invited here. (mysterious music) (horse whinnying) (horse trotting) (suspenseful music) (gentle piano music) (thunder crashing) - Rebecca, darling, do you remember this? (eerie music) You're just as beautiful as the first day we met. You haven't changed, my darling. Remember when I painted the portrait? We were so happy then. We were going to be married. Remember? What happened to us, Rebecca? What happened? (glass breaks) Oh, God. I'll never forget what they did to us! (melancholy music) That night, I wanted you. Just like I want you now. Darling, I wanna feel you next to me. I want you as it's meant to be. Who's there? (dramatic music) Rebecca! Rebecca! (thunder crashing) She's gone because of you! Why'd you have to come here? - [Man Voiceover] My darling, I can't thank you enough for concealing me in your house. You saved my life. Perhaps that is the reason the oval portrait is my greatest work. It is full of all my love for you, all my gratitude. This war won't last forever, and soon we'll be together again. Love, Joseph. (woman crying) (dramatic music) - You. - The house hasn't changed. It looks the same as it did the first time I saw it. Ah, Rebecca, how beautiful she was. It almost seems to be alive. - Yes. You can almost see her breathing. Her eyes, you can feel them watching you, every moment you're in this room. - My daughter, Lisa, Captain Johnson. - My pleasure, miss. - Excuse me. Mrs. Buckingham, a letter just arrived for you. You. How dare you come here! Get out! Get out of this house! - Yes. I think it would be better I go. I hope the relationship I had with your brother can continue with the two of you. Madam. (somber music) - Please, Mrs. Warren, how can you act like that? - I'm sorry. - You should be more than sorry. You may have had this house pretty much to yourself while my brother was in that, that hospital, but may I remind you that you are still only a hired servant? I hope you will remember your place in the future. - Please forgive my mother, Mrs. Warren. - Lisa, come here, darling. (gentle music) - [Lisa] What is it, Mother? - It's Regina and Paul. They won't be able to be here tomorrow. It'll be another week before they can be here. That woman is being intolerable. We'll go to my room where we can have some privacy. Really, I find all this quite impossible. That woman, you're foolishness about ghosts. Lisa, you're not listening to a word I'm saying. This dress must've been hers. (light music) - Hello? Is somebody there? Yoo-hoo, is anybody (throat clears) Is anybody home? (dramatic music) Oh, Dorrie Mullens, you silly thing, scared of your own reflection. Ooh! (mysterious music) - Oh, dear, dear. Wake up, wake up. - You're, you're not a ghost, are you? - Of course not. What a stupid question. - Well, I heard this place was haunted. - What are you doing here? How did you get in? - Well, the door was open. I'm the new cook. This place isn't really haunted, is it? - Of course not. - I've never seen a ghost myself, but, if I saw one, I swear (sighs) I'd just die on the spot. - Oh, that's nonsense. There are no such things as ghosts, except in the minds of superstitious people. Now, come along. The servants' quarters are this way. This way, please. Mrs. Warren is in charge here. I suppose she has a room ready for you. You were expected today, weren't you? - Yes, ma'am, I sure was expected. (dramatic music) - Joseph. - Rebecca! - Joseph. - Rebecca, darling, I knew you'd come back. I've been waiting for you. - No, you're mistaken! I'm not Rebecca! - Who are you? How dare you wear these clothes! - Oh, oh, no. No, please. - Miss Lisa, what happened? - Oh, Mrs. Warren! That man, Joseph, he tried to kill me! - That dress! What aren't you doing in that dress? It belonged to Miss Rebecca! - I found it upstairs. - And Joseph saw you in it. I must ask you, Miss Lisa, never to wear anything of hers. - Buy why? - But you must understand, for those of us who loved her, they bring back memories, tragic memories. - I understand. I loved once. We were going to be married. He went off to war. He was reported missing. I still can't believe that he'll never come back. Even after all these years, I keep hoping that... I must go to my room. (dramatic music) Mrs. Warren! Mother! (eerie music) Rebecca. - [Rebecca] Lisa. Lisa! - [Mrs. Warren] Mr. Ashcroft, come in. - Ah, Mrs. Warren. Thank you. Nasty weather blowing up. Have the others arrived? - Only Mrs. Buckingham and her daughter. The other niece and her husband will be delayed. - [Mrs. Buckingham] Uh, Mrs. Warren, who's is it? - It's Mr. Ashcroft, your brother's attorney. - Mrs. Buckingham. - [Mrs. Buckingham] Oh my dear Mr. Ashcroft. - I understand that your niece, Mrs. Crenshaw, has been delayed. - Yes, she won't be here for another week. Mrs. Warren, perhaps you will bring the tea while Mr. Ashcroft and I talk in the parlor. - Though I would rather- - Yes, madam. (dramatic music) - Lisa! What happened? Lisa? Are you all right? Darling, what happened? Say something. - Please, Mother, I'm quite all right. - Oh, this is Mr. Ashcroft, your uncle's attorney. - Would you like me to send the doctor when I return to town? - The doctor can't help her. The only thing you can do for her is to take her away from this house. - [Rebecca] Lisa. - The poor darling is simply exhausted. - Please, Mrs. Warren, would you help me go to my room? - She's under tension from all this foolish talk about Rebecca. Since we've been in this house, she's spent hours staring at that portrait. I sometimes think there's something evil in this house. - This house has quite a story to it, Mrs. Buckingham. I would keep an open mind. - Oh, Mrs. Warren. I have a feeling that I'm going to die very soon. - Don't talk like that. Now, you must listen to me, Miss Lisa. You must leave this house tonight. - But I'm beginning to understand everything about this house, as if I'm part of it. And it wants me to stay. - Don't you understand? It's Miss Rebecca who wants you to stay. She must possess you before she will ever rest in peace. - Mrs. Warren, how did they meet? - It was the war. (guns firing) I remember. (bugle charge music) (exciting music) (gentle music) (door opening and closing) - [Soldier] He's inside. Surround the house. Don't let him get away. Take up your positions. (perilous music) (hand knocking) Open up in there! Open up! - Mrs. Warren, you may open the door. - [Soldier] I'm sorry, madam, I must ask you to assemble all the people in the house. - First, Captain, I suggest you tell me what this is all about. - [Captain] We're searching for an enemy soldier. We followed him in this direction. He must be found. - I understand your duty captain. I can assure you there's no one hiding here. Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Major Alexander Huntington. - [Captain] Major Huntington, I didn't know. I'm sorry, sir. - [Major Huntington] I would be carrying out my duty, Captain. (tense music) - That won't be necessary, Major. Major Huntington, my apologies. - I hope they catch him. Imagine, an enemy soldier hiding in my house. That will be all, Mrs. Warren. You may retire. - Good night, sir. - You coming, Rebecca? - In a moment, Father. The excitement and everything, I think I'll find something to read until I can get back to sleep. - All right, darling, I'll see you in the morning. (dramatic music) (tense music) - I better get a pail of hot water and some bandages. (gentle music) (soldier groans) Oh. Oh. He's already lost a lot of blood. Even if we can save him, he'll have to rest for a few days. - Where can we hide him? - I don't know! I suppose we can put him in my room. That's about the only place in the house your father doesn't go. - They are inviting me and my beautiful daughter to a ball. A good time to be thinking of parties, when a war is going on and many good men are dying. Parties. Fops who buy their way out of the army. Instead of holding guns and the sabers, they want to hold girls, especially my beautiful daughter. - But, Father, I'd love to go. I know almost no one my own age. All I know of life and love is what I've found in the books I've read. - Books? What kind of books? - Books that were my mother's. - Your mother! you'll always be proud of your mother, won't you? Well, I'm going to tell you something. Your mother was no better than a whore! She had to run away with the first man who came along! - Father- - Yes, that's the truth about your hallowed mother! But you don't want to hear the truth, do you? You just want to hear about love and the rest of the trash from books that filled your mother's head! I'll protect you, keep you from ending up like your mother. I swear to God, if I ever find you with a man, I'll kill him. And I'll throw you out of this house. You'll end up no better than the worthless tramp you call your mother! - Father. (dramatic music) (gentle music) (Rebecca crying) - Don't cry, Rebecca. Your mother was a wonderful woman. And you should always be proud of her. She married your father full of hopes and illusions, but he was a jealous and possessive man. He loved her too much. It became an evil, ugly thing. - That's why she left? - Yes. She was so hungry for real love. She finally found it with another man. He was poor, but, oh, they were in love. And when she was sick and dying, she, she came to see your father. But he could not forgive her. You're not a little girl anymore. You can't find real love in books. You have to search for it in life. When your mother died, I promised her that I would take care of you. I will do the impossible for your happiness. - Thank you, Mrs. Warren. Thank you. - So the fugitive escaped. - We found his horse not far from here. There was blood on the saddle, so I doubt he could have gotten very far without it. - [Major Huntington] Did you search every house? - [Captain] Yes, sir. My men and I covered the entire area. That is to say with one exception. - [Rebecca] Good evening, Captain, Father. - Yes, Rebecca. - I came to apologize for what happened this afternoon, Father. - (throat clears) Your apology is well received, my daughter. - You must forgive me Major, Miss Huntington. I must take my leave. We will see you tomorrow. Miss Huntington. - Yes, of course. I'll see you to the door. (gentle music) - I'm Mrs. Warren. - Yes, I remember. You helped fix my wound. - I brought you some food. - No, thank you. I'm not hungry. - But you must eat if you want to regain your strength. Where did you get that medal? - Oh, my real mother gave it to me when I was a baby. I didn't really know her. (romantic music) - Joseph? - Yes? - What did you do before you became a soldier? - I was a painter. - Well, when this is all over, the fighting I mean, are you planning to go back to your painting? - Rebecca, I would like to paint you. - Joseph, I would love that. - Your portrait will be ready tomorrow, and then you'll have your wish. We'll call it the, the oval portrait. - Rebecca, do you take Joseph here present for your beloved husband according to the rights of our Holy Mother Church? (wedding music) - I do. - Joseph, do you take Rebecca here present for your beloved wife according to the rights- - Stop this marriage! You're under arrest! We didn't suspect he would have hidden in your house. We've been searching for him for three months! Take him to the carriage! - Don't worry, Rebecca. I'll be back. (somber music) - What will they do to him? - It is not for me to say, ma'am. Thank you, Father, for assisting in his capture. - Traitor! Traitor to God! I hope you rot in hell for what you've done! - You told me you were his friend! He lied to me. - Joseph. (melancholy music) Oh! (dramatic music) Oh! (Rebecca moaning) Mrs. Warren! Oh, Mrs. Warren! Mrs. Warren. (Rebecca crying) - Don't worry, my child. In a short time, it will be over. Let me take you to your room. Come. - [Rebecca] Oh, please, please help me. (somber music) - [Major Huntington] Here we are. It's all right, I'll get it. (dangerous music) (suspenseful music) (Rebecca moaning) - I'd better get the doctor. I'll be right back. (gentle music) - [Major Huntington] Good evening, Mrs. Warren. It's good to be home at last. - [Mrs. Warren] Major, I'm uh, I'm so glad you're home, sir. - What a beautiful painting of Rebecca. It seems so real. Who painted it? - Someone that passed by. I, I thought it would be wonderful to surprise you with a portrait of your daughter. (hand knocking) - [Major Huntington] See who's at the door, please. (tense music) - Good evening, madam. Is the major home? - No. No, he hasn't arrived yet. - Who's at the door, Mrs. Warren? - Please, Mr. Johnson, don't tell the major anything of what happened. I beg of you. - I must see the major. - [Major Huntington] Glad to see you again, Captain Johnson. How do you like the portrait? - The artist must have taken many hours to paint such a beautiful portrait of your daughter. Welcome home, Major. I'm glad the war is over. - Yes, and I am glad to be home. - [Captain Johnson] Well, Major, it was a pleasure seeing you. I'm sorry my visit must be so short, but I have friends waiting outside. By the way, the soldier we were looking for was found. - Oh, where? - You should ask your daughter who painted that marvelous portrait. You'd be surprised. (somber music) - Who painted that portrait? - I just wanted a portrait of Rebecca, that's all. That's why I hired him. - A man? A man who was with my daughter for days, weeks. That's the way you took care of her? Well, she must know who painted the picture! - Please, Major. Don't disturb her. She's very ill! - So you're sick, eh? - I'm so glad you came. I have so much to tell you. - I imagine you do. Like who painted that portrait of you. - She had nothing to do with it. I've already told you. - You've already told me a lie! I want to hear the truth. You've always covered for Rebecca, Mrs. Warren, but no more. Who did that painting, Rebecca? - A soldier, Father. - Not just a soldier, an enemy soldier! - Father, I'm very ill. - Please, can't you see? She's in no condition to talk now. - Get out, Mrs. Warren! This is not your affair! What's that? So. He wasn't only a painter. He was your lover. - No, no. - [Major Huntington] You whore! - No. - Just like your mother. - No, Father. - You've disgraced me just like your mother! I warned you! Get out of this house! - No, no, Father, no! Please. No, Father, please. You don't understand. - [Major Huntington] I understand! - No, Father, no, please! - Major, please! Please forgive her! - Father, no! - She's your child! - No, please, Father! My baby! - Get out! Get out of this house before I kill you! (Rebecca moaning) - Oh, please, Father, have mercy on me. My baby. No! - Get out! - No! - Get out! - No, Father, no! My baby! - Out! Get out! (melodramatic music) (hand knocking) - [Rebecca] Father, please, don't shut me out! Please, Father, please! Oh, God, won't somebody help me? My baby! Oh, Mrs. Warren! Oh, God, please help me! Oh, my baby! Oh, Father, please let me in! Don't shut me out, Father, please! Help, Mrs. Warren, please. Help me! - Mrs. Warren! - Father, please let me in! - You open that door, and I'll shoot you. - [Rebecca] Oh, please, help me! (somber music) - He'll have to go to a hospital. He doesn't see, hear or feel anything. His mind is paralyzed, perhaps forever. - Well, as you wish, Doctor. - I'll make the arrangements today. He can be committed immediately. - Thank you, Dr. Nelson. - Now, I'd better take a look at my other patient. - My baby! - He's fine, and we must get you well so you can feed him. - You're lying. He's dead! He killed him. Oh, God, how I hate my father! - No, Rebecca, try to calm down. You must forget your hatred. - I'll never forget what my father did to me or my baby! Just like I'll never forget the love Joseph gave to me. (crying) - Here, this will help you rest. (gentle music) (romantic music) - Well, aren't you gonna let me in? - Joseph. - Isn't Rebecca here? - Please, follow me. (tense music) (somber music) (dramatic music) - Oh, God! (thunder crashing) (somber music) - Joseph. I have the house for now. You're welcome to stay, until you make your plans. It's such a large house for me to live alone. So please stay, even if only for a few days. I imagine you want to be alone for now, so I'll, I'll see you back at the house. - [Rebecca] Joseph. Joseph. (thunder crashing) (somber music) - [Joseph] Rebecca! Rebecca! (tense music) (dramatic music) - All these years haven't changed Joseph. His love for Rebecca grows stronger every day. He really believes that Rebecca waiting for him in this house. (tense music) - [Rebecca] Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. - Well, do you have any idea why she's behaving this way? - Well, she won't come out of her room when anyone's around. I checked her room once, and she wasn't there. So I guess the idea of Rebecca's ghost doesn't trouble her anymore. - Rebecca's ghost? What is this all about? - Oh, some foolishness about Rebecca's portrait. (gentle music) - It's beautiful. It's as if she were alive inside the frame. - Lisa spends hours staring at it. - So this was Rebecca. You know, I didn't realize that Lisa resembled her so. - Oh? Well, that's strange. I hadn't noticed it. Oh, Regina, I hope you can persuade Lisa to leave that room. I really feel she should be there when the attorney reads the will. - Well, of course. I'm sure Lisa will listen to me. - Oh, good. (Rebecca laughing) - [Regina] Lisa. (hand knocking) Lisa, open up, it's Regina. Lisa, answer me, please. Are you all right? - I'm all right. I just, I'm all right. I just don't want to talk to anyone now. - [Regina] All right, but first you'll have to promise you'll come downstairs when the will is read. - I promise. - This shouldn't take long. The major left few heirs, so the will is rather brief. - That is not the last will he left. He made a new will the morning after he drove Rebecca out of the house. Dr. Nelson, may his soul rest in peace, signed as witness. He put the new will in the safety box. - Can you show me where the new will is? - Of course. I think I may even have the key here someplace. (eerie music) - Well, I think things have worked out wonderfully. Mrs. Warren gets to the house, and we divide the balance of the estate. - I was afraid as his sister I'd be left with this awful house. (eerie music) - Please excuse my tardiness. - [Paul] Allow me, Lisa. - Lisa, darling, have you been ill? - No, I'm quite all right. - Oh, God, I should have sent you away from this house when Mrs. Warren told me. I'll start the packing. We're leaving immediately. - No, I won't go! I'm part of this house now. No, I can't leave. I won't leave. - Doris? Doris. Doris, I want you to come upstairs with me and pack Miss Lisa's things. She's leaving tonight. - Yes, madam. (doors slam) - [Mr. Ashcroft] Oh, dear. (woman yells) (Rebecca laughing) - Lisa! Lisa. - I'll find her. She can't have gone far. - Wait, Paul, don't leave me here! - [Mrs. Buckingham] She was here just a moment ago. Where can she be? - Everything here is mine and mine alone forever! This dress is mine. (laughs) It's mine! Everything is mine! This is mine, Rebecca. - [Paul] Lisa? Lisa? (mysterious music) (thunder crashing) (dramatic music) - Joseph? Joseph! Many times I've waited for you. The memories are what brought me back. (romantic music) Joseph? Joseph, are you in there? Joseph, where are you? Remember the first time? You leaned against my body, and I felt your warmth. Oh, Joseph. And when my father left, and we were alone together. Oh, how I hated him. Oh, Joseph, Joseph. (dramatic music) (Lisa screams) (gentle music) - Try to forget everything that's happened in this house. Take good care of Miss Lisa. - I will, Mrs. Warren, I will. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mrs. Warren. Goodbye, my love. Goodbye forever. (gentle music) (mysterious music) - Please let us hear from you, Mrs. Warren, and, someday, perhaps we might return to see you. - This is your house whenever you want to stop by. - Thank you, Mrs. Warren. - Goodbye. - [Regina] Goodbye. (light music) (romantic piano music) - Rebecca, remember? We never, never danced our song. (eerie music) (Joseph laughing) - My keys! My keys are gone. (dramatic music) (Joseph laughing) - Oh, Rebecca, darling. Rebecca, I'm so close to you. Oh. (disturbed music) Oh, I hope this night never ends. - Oh my God! Oh, no. Joseph. (Joseph gasps) No. - [Joseph] Rebecca! - [Priest] Joseph, do you take Rebecca here present for your beloved wife? (Joseph gasps) (wedding music) (eerie music) - Rebecca, where are you? They've come to take away from me. Don't leave me. Take me with you. Take me with you! Rebecca! - Arrest this man. - No you don't. (tense music) - You're under arrest! You're under arrest! - Not this time. - You are under arrest. (Joseph grunting) - Rebecca. - Joseph. - Rebecca! - Joseph. I did everything for you. I even forged the will, so we could have this house. Poor Joseph, you are mad. I gave you up once, because I wasn't married. I didn't want to disgrace you. I meant to give you happiness, but now... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my son. But this world is not for you. (gun fires) (gun fires) (gentle music) (Joseph moans) Oh. Die! Please, die, my son. - Mother. - Oh, Joseph. I just couldn't let you suffer any longer. (crying) (melodramatic music) - Joseph, I've waited for you so long. - [Joseph] Rebecca, at last we're together forever. (melodramatic music)
