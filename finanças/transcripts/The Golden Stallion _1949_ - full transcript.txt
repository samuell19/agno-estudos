Well, there comes our herd. And look at that wild mare leadin' 'em. She's no wild mare. She's trained to bring 'em back. Trained to? Whadda ya mean? Just what I say. We drive the horses across the border and when we put her back in with 'em, she brings 'em home. [whinnies] Which ones do we pick up? There'll be some tame ones in with the herd marked with an "X." All right, let's go! [man] Yaa! Yaa! Haw! Haw! Take care o' this. We'll be usin' it again. Head 'em out to the North range and spread some feed around. They'll stay there until we need 'em. What'll it be? Tell the boss I'm here. Pour me a drink. I'll be back in a minute. [buzzer rings] Everything go all right? Look. - How'd the bell-mare work out? - Better than ever. She brought that band across the border like she had firecrackers on her tail. Well, where's the herd now? Up on the North Range. We can pick 'em up again any time we want. Did you ever see such beauties! We're really getting organized. Yeah. I guess those'll make a lot o' ladies happy. Well they won't all be ladies, but they'll be happy. [chuckles] Just keep an eye on those horses and you'll always have plenty of egg money. If that gang on the other end does its part, we'll do ours. This whole business can go on forever. [honks horn] [man] Look out, fellas! Get outta the way! [continues honking horn] Hey, I thought you said you fixed those brakes. Yeah, I thought I said I fixed 'em, too. Fine start we're gettin' with the owner of the Circle B. I don't think she'll appreciate it. Well, anybody that'd live way out in this forsaken country wouldn't care much what ya did. She's probably an old wizened-up old battle-axe anyway. [chuckles] You better stick this back up and fix these brakes. When you get finished, come on down to the ranch. It's right at the bottom of the hill. OK. I'll get these brakes fixed or try. Let's see now, to tighten the brakes the nut goes to the right. No to the left.

Well, I don't know, but if they have any luck with those horses, that money sure will be. Oh, boy, I sure hope they're handsome. If they're anything like the cowboys that used to hang around here five years ago, they'll all be bowlegged, need a shave and wear big, black hats. [approaching horses] [horse whinnies] That could be them! They got pack horses. Oh, boy, I'm not taking any chances. I'm gonna make myself glamour. Maybe one of them hasn't bow legs 'n big beard 'n things like that. Hello! [car horn honks] [man] Get outta the way, Roy, they're gone again! [man shouts] Help! Help! Hurry! Somebody! Oh! Oh! You help me! Gee thanks! Say are you Stormy Billings? That's right just Stormy. Well, I'm Roy Rogers. Just Roy. There's the fellas I wrote you about, Stormy. [Stormy] Hi, fellas. - Hi'ya, Miss Billings. - Hi. And this is Sparrow Biffle. Say, what happened to your friend? Oh, that's Pepi. You see, we weren't expecting you till tomorrow and she's kind of bashful. I hope we didn't scare her. Oh, don't you worry about that. Hey, Roy! The most amazin' thing happened about them brakes. That nut doesn't go to the left, it goes to the right. Oh, uh, by the way, uh, do you think your horse might be kinda tired holding both of us? - Yeah. - Oh, here, let me help you down. This is it, boys. This is fine, isn't it, Sparrow? Boy, it sure is. You know, you're lucky. That wild herd's been running on our side of the border and I understand it's the first time in months. Well, we want to get at them the first thing in the morning. You know we saw some tracks on the way in. - You did? Good. - Mm-hm. I'll be up bright and early because I want to take you out to the North Range. This time of year that's about the only place they can find any feed. I was raised around here and I know just about every foot of this ground. - That's awfully nice of you. - Nice! The sooner you get those horses, the sooner you get paid. The sooner you get paid, the sooner I get paid. Well! Yoo-hoo! Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends? Oh, of course, Pepi. Mr. Rogers, this is Miss Valdez. Charmed. [thud] A couple on the house. Jeff take a look at this. "The old Circle B Ranch, which has been closed down since the death of Frank Billings, is going to be reopened by his daughter, - who recently returned from the East." - That's right. She was in town yesterday with a girlfriend of hers, a South American. They were buyin' supplies. They're gonna clean up the ranch and start operating again. "Roy Rogers, the well-known horse trainer, has leased the Circle B Ranch from the Billings girl." That must be the reason she's re-opening the ranch. "It has been reported that Rogers has recently signed a contract with one of the biggest cattle corporations to supply them with roping horses, which he expects to procure from a wild herd ranging at present along the border." that I was born ¶I feel gld ¶ As I greet the crimson dawn ¶ ¶ Ridin' my golden stallion ¶ What a lucky guy am I ¶ Underneath the sky-blue sky ¶ ¶ Ridin' my golden stallion ¶ Across the purple sage we ride ¶ ¶ Along the silvery dew ¶ At night I'll find him by my side ¶ ¶ He'll always see me through ¶ Then we'll both be on our way ¶ ¶ As we greet another day ¶ Ridin' my golden stallion See, Roy, I told you. Just look at those tracks. Look, Roy, there's a shoe print. What's a wild horse doin' with shoes on? It's a shoe print all right, but only one and on the front foot. Why would anyone shoe a horse that way? They wouldn't. My guess is, it's a tame horse gone wild and he's lost all but one of his shoes. Let's go. Stormy, you were right. Here they are. I told you the leader was a mare. [whinnies] Boy, look at 'em run! On up to the left there's a box canyon. Maybe you can turn 'em into it. This is a break for us, money in the bank, come on. Whoa, Nelly! [men shouting] [man] Haa! Haa! Get in there! Haa haa! Yee-ha, ha! [Roy] Boy, oh, boy, we got 'em boxed in! Let's get these ropes stretched across that opening. Take it easy, though, they're pretty spooky. Stormy! Stay back they might stampede. I don't think they will if you can keep the mare from breaking out. What're you doing Roy? I'm gonna send Trigger in with the herd. Maybe he can quiet 'em down and help us hold 'em. Say, he's gonna get along all right with that little filly. Yeah, he sure is. - They got the bell-mare! - That's gonna make it tough. Yeah a couple o' shots would spook 'em up, and I don't think they'll be able to hold 'em. [gunfire] [man] Get back there! Whoa! Whoa! Get back there! I don't know what you did that for, but you better have a good answer. I just saved you a lot of trouble. You oughta thank me, Rogers. You know sometimes ranchers' horses get mixed in the herd. If you go catchin' 'em, you might find yourself right in the middle of a horse rustling charge. You can't call it rustling, if there isn't any brand on the horses and they're on free range. Now, Miss Billings, don't you know that's the wrong attitude? You haven't been around here for four or five years. Things have changed. I'm only tryin' to help keep you outta trouble, Rogers. I think the best thing you can do is sort of pull up stakes and mosey on. These ranchers around here have short tempers. They might not like the idea of a stranger movin' in. The last time I saw you, mister, you were doin' 90 days for runnin' somebody else's horses in New Mexico. Stormy, get back outta the way. There's no use in all of us gettin' shot up. This is just between you and me. No you don't! Roy! Roy! He's had enough. Here, lemme help ya up. [Stormy] Sparrow! Well, now we're even. All right, fellas, put 'em away. Let's get outta here. And don't forget any time you start messin' around with those wild horses there's gonna be a reception committee waitin' for ya. And next time, it won't be fists. I hope you're on that reception committee. I will be. But there'd better not be a next time. Bring the saddle, Sparrow. You know, I don't think this guy's gonna scare so easy. Well, anyway he didn't get the bell-mare. lost his own palomino, too. [Pepi humming] Hi, Stormy. You come back too early now you spoil my surprise. What is all this, Pepi? Oh, Stormy, we're going to have a square-head dance tonight for Roy. -You mean square dance. - Square dance. I'm sorry, Pepi, but I don't think Roy and the rest of us feel much like a party. Oh, but I already invited everybody. What's the matter? Something wrong? Had a little trouble out on the North Range today. Had a little bad luck, Pepi. We lost the wild herd and Trigger went with them. Trigger. I am sorry. I was only trying to make Roy feel at home. Well, I guess we better take the decorations down. - I'm sorry, Pepi. It was a nice try anyway. - [approaching footsteps] - Hello, Stormy. - Well, hello. Looks like you're going to have a party. Roy, this is Mr. Middleton. Mr. Rogers. - How do you do. - Glad to know you. Sparrow Biffle. And Miss Valdez. - Well, how do you do. - Mr. Middleton was a good friend of my father's. I read in the paper about your plans for the Circle B. You know, Stormy has always been like a younger sister even though I haven't seen her for a long time. That's why I came up to see you today. I hear you had a little trouble, a fight out on the range. That's right. Did you recognize anybody in the other outfit? Sparrow did. He recognized one of the men as a jailbird he'd seen in New Mexico. That's what started the fight. Well, you know how some people are, Rogers. They sort of resent a stranger moving in all of a sudden and taking over. I don't take over anything but wild horses and that's nobody's business but my own. Well, I guess that's one way of looking at it. But, you know you've got to be practical about these things. Hey, Roy! Come on out! Trigger's come back! [Roy] What?! Wait a minute! He's brought a friend with him. It's the mare that leads the wild horses. Yeah, and it looks like love at first sight. [whinnies quietly] Everybody stay right here. Isn't it wonderful? Yeah. Great! [whinnies quietly] [whistles] I think she's beautiful! Trigger thinks she's beautiful, too. Hey, now the herd hasn't got a leader. We oughta be able to get the rest of 'em easy. Ha this is sure a lucky break. Now we can have our party tonight, no? - Yeah, how about it, Roy? - Why I think it's a wonderful idea. - Well, why not? - Good. - [all talking] - I'll see you tonight.

I think I'll go out and have a look at Trigger and the bell-mare. Be right back. All right, I'll fix you a plate. Two of 'em, huh? Yeah. Here's some more. After all they might be thirsty. Get that horse away from him! Holy mackerel! That's the same guy that tried to run us outta the country today. - It sure is. - How'd it happen? Well, it's pretty obvious to me. I'm gonna get the sheriff. How did it happen? I don't know, but the bell-mare's gone. I had the Deputy bring you to town, Roy, because Jeff Middleton's filed a complaint against either you or Trigger. He claims somebody's got to pay for the death of Ed Hart, and I believe he's right. But we went through all that last night, sheriff. Yes, I know. You claimed it was the wild bell-mare. When Hart was discovered, there was no bell-mare around. When we got to the corral, there was just you, Trigger and the body. The blow on the head was obviously made by some hard object like Trigger's hoof. So that's the way it is, Roy. If you didn't do it, it must've been Trigger. But it's all just circumstantial evidence. In this case, circumstantial evidence is enough. I'm afraid he's right. You admitted he ran with the wild herd. You know the law of the range. A killer horse is a killer horse and must be destroyed. I hereby order that Trigger be destroyed for the death of Ed Hart. All right, Mac, see that it's carried out. Take your hands off him, he's no killer! Look here, Roy, I intend to see the law carried out. All right, take him away. Hold it, sheriff. I have a confession to make. What do you mean, Roy? I killed Ed Hart. I did it in self-defense. Yesterday afternoon we had a fight and he threatened me and I have witnesses to prove it. Stormy you heard him threaten me, didn't you? Yes, Roy, but don't you realize that... Why would you want to kill him? I didn't want to. It was an accident. Are you sure you're not doing this to protect Trigger? Last night I caught Ed Hart trying to steal the bell-mare. We fought again. His head hit against one of the corral posts and he died. Are you ready to sign a confession to that effect? Yes, sheriff, I'll sign it. Well, in that case, Judge Harrison'll perhaps set your trial for tomorrow. Meantime, I'll have to hold you. Is there anything I can do for you, Roy? There sure is, Stormy. [whinnies] Look after Trigger. I'm sorry, Roy, we'll have to hold Trigger too. Take him to the barn. See that he's well taken care of. Well, Jeff, the trial's all over. What was the verdict? Judge Harrison found him guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to five to ten years, plus five thousand dollars fine. [whistles] Five grand, huh? Five years that means he'll probably work on the road gang and be out in three on good behavior. That'll give us plenty of time. Hey, you know the boys haven't been able to find that bell-mare yet. We can't run the herd through without her. Yeah, they've searched every canyon. Can't seem to locate her. It's funny how that horse disappeared. Say, uh, speakin' of horses, Rogers can't pay his fine so the sheriff is gonna auction off that palomino of his. - Trigger, huh? - Yeah. - When? - Today in just a little while. I've got an idea. Come on. I'll give you all the money you need. I want you to get over to the auction and buy that horse. Then take him out to Hart's barn. What do you want with Trigger? Well, if we can't find the bell-mare, we've gotta train another horse to lead the herd. Trigger's the fastest and the smartest horse in the country. We'll starve him, rough him up a bit and in a couple of months he'll be running that herd of wild horses back and forth across the border better than she did. How high do you want me to go on the bidding? Use your own judgment. I want that horse. He's right over there. I think I can trust you folks. I've gotta go down and start the auction. Thanks, Sheriff. We'll just be a few minutes. Come on, Sparrow. - Hello, Roy. - Hi, Stormy. Listen, we raised all the cash we could, and we have three thousand dollars. Swell! That won't pay my fine, but I don't think any body'll bid that much for Trigger. [Sparrow] Yeah, at least Trigger'll be safe. And Roy, we looked at those corrals like you told us. Yes, we did, Roy and Trigger obviously opened his corral gate, but the corral that mare was in, was opened by somebody who was trying to lead her away. We can prove this, Roy. Why don't you let me have your trial re-opened? It wouldn't do any good. We'd be right back where we started. They wouldn't believe the mare did it anyway, and it'd come back on Trigger. Before we could get enough evidence to clear him, they'd have him destroyed. This way at least it'll give us enough time to look for clues that will clear both of us. Hey, we'd better get to that auction. After all this trouble Trigger's caused us, we don't wanta lose him. That's right. See you later, Roy. Bye. Bye. [Trigger whinnies] [people chattering] I'll now open the auction for the sale of this beautiful palomino horse. - How much am I bid? - One thousand dollars. One thousand dollars bid for this beautiful stallion. [sheriff] Do I hear twelve-fifty? - One thousand dollars... - Two thousand dollars. [sheriff] Two thousand dollars. [Stormy] Two thousand one hundred dollars. Two thousand one hundred dollars bid for Trigger. Do I hear twenty-five hundred? Three thousand dollars. [sheriff] Three thousand dollars bid for Trigger by this gentleman here. Are there any more bids, gentlemen, for this beautiful stallion? Going for three thousand once. Going for three thousand twice. [Stormy] Three thousand one hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-four cents. [man] Five thousand dollars! [sheriff] Five thousand dollars. Going... going, gone to this gentleman here. - Hi, Roy. - Hi. We heard they were going to send you to road camp this afternoon and the sheriff said we could come down and say goodbye. I'm sure glad you did. I just want to say I'm awfully sorry for what's happened. Well, there's no use worryin' about that now. But if you happen to hear anything, be sure and let me know. Tell the Sagers goodbye for me, will you? The boys are gonna get a job close by to watch after things so don't worry. We'll write you every week, Roy. Stormy the sheriff said two minutes. Come on. How're you making out with Trigger? OK, now but we had a lotta trouble at first. Guess he couldn't figure out what happened to Rogers. Go get him, boys, bring him out and show the boss what he can do. We got him trained now so he'll bring those horses back from anywhere. Good. I just got another letter from our associates. They're all set to send another shipment through and they want to know when we'll be ready. - [whip cracking] - Oh, here he comes now. [man shouting] Hey! There's the bell-mare. - Where'd you pick her up? - She's been hanging around here a couple o' weeks. She was easy to catch. Hey, that's why she left the herd and we couldn't find her. Yeah, she's gonna have a colt. There isn't a horse in the world that could catch him. I wonder what became of that mare. I don't know. She must've cut off back there in the rocks. Well, she isn't important to us any more as long as Trigger rejoins the herd. Aw, don't worry about him. The mare'll have her colt and Trigger'll bring 'em all back. He knows that herd needs 'em. [whinnies quietly] Hi, Tom, got the mail. Mannix. Felton. Rogers. Burns. [Roy reading] "Dear Roy, I have the most exciting news for you. While I was writing this letter, I heard a horse whinny. I rushed out of the house and Trigger had come back to the ranch. Something small and golden was following him. When I ran out to try to coax him into the yard Trigger took off for the hills leaving behind the most beautiful little Palomino colt you've ever seen. While I was looking the colt over Trigger was watching me from the hill. He must've been satisfied that his son was in good hands and was gonna get the best of care, because he tossed his head and went back to join the wild herd. Roy, he's the spittin' image of his father if ever a colt was. I'll write again soon. Love, Stormy." [Stormy] "Dear Roy, one whole year has passed since Trigger left his son here to stay with us, and today he's celebrating his first birthday. Roy, he's grown like a weed and I wish you were here to see him. He and Pepi have developed a beautiful friendship and now he doesn't even mind that blue ribbon that she insists he wear. At first he thought it was too sissyfied for a son of Trigger's. Just now he pulled an old trick of Trigger's, and we decided there was only one thing we should call him. I'm sure you'll approve, when you know what his name is: Trigger, Junior. As for Trigger himself, Sparrow has seen him several times in the last year, running with the herd. He's gone back to the wild, Roy. No one can get near him. The herd spends most of its time below the border, but occasionally they come back on this side. There's only one boss in the herd. Naturally, it's Trigger." [Sparrow] "Dear Roy, time sure passes quick. Just think, another whole year's passed since Pepi tied that ribbon on Trigger, Junior. Gosh, how he's grown in that one year, Roy. He's a full grown horse now and knows almost as many tricks as his old man. Stormy taught him the 'march.' Pepi taught him to rumba. And he taught himself to bow. Boy, oh, boy, he's some horse, Roy, and I know you'll approve of him. Well, this is the last letter we'll be writin' to you because we're all lookin' forward to seein' you in a few days when you get back here to await your parole in Oro City. Everyone sends their regards. Sparrow." [whistling along to music] Sure glad to have you back, Roy. It's been a long time. I haven't had a decent game of checkers since you left. Glad to be back, sheriff. You know, to this day I can't figure out why Ben bought Trigger for all that money and when the horse got away, he didn't even try to catch him. That's only one of the things around here that doesn't make sense. From what Stormy and the boys can find out, Ben never had more than five dollars at one time in his life. Does he still hang around Middleton's hotel? So far as I know. Say, maybe Middleton put up the money. But why? He's in the hotel business. Your move. Yeah, I know, Roy, but where to? [man on radio] This is your evening news roundup of bulletins from the southwest. Last night Federal law enforcement officers made complete search of every car on the border road near Oro City in a series of unexpected road blocks. It is rumored they were checking on smugglers. I can't concentrate with that thing goin' on. What're the Federal men doin' around here? Mostly drivin' me crazy. They claim for the last couple o' months there's been a leak at the border. They figure it's somewhere in this section. We've watched every road and pass for 24 hours a day and can't find a thing. - What kind of a leak? - Diamonds. They claim they're floodin' the north with smuggled diamonds. Say, that's a pretty smart play, Roy. Sheriff, I've got an idea for a smarter one. Well, let me have it. I'm glad to say, Middleton, your credit with us is excellent. That ought to take care of all your expenses for the next shipment. We'll pay you the rest when we get the stones. Everything's well organized. The herd of wild horses is below the border. [chuckles] After going back and forth so many times the last couple of years, don't worry they're ready and waiting. So are the diamonds. It's all right, it's just one of my boys. Well, thanks very much for your order, Mr. Middleton. Anytime you need any more hotel supplies, just let me know. I put a door on this office for privacy. Can't you see I was transacting important business? Rogers is outta jail. It's impossible. He's still got two months. They were playing checkers. He slugged the sheriff and took off. That means he'll be looking for that horse of his. Right now we've got another shipment ready to come north. We better make up our own posse and give the sheriff a hand. - Ah, good evening, sheriff. - It's a bad evening. - Did you hear Rogers slugged me and got away? - Yeah, we sure did. Well, I wanta form a posse and pick him up before he gets away from this part of the country. Well, I think we can find enough law-abiding volunteers right here in the bar. You men heard what the Sheriff said. A lot of you were friends of Ed Hart. This is your chance to square things. I'll even furnish the guns. Pass 'em out, Spud. Any idea which way Rogers is headed? Chances are he picked up those friends of his at the Circle B and headed for the border. All right. [approaching horse footsteps] [whinnies quietly] Hi, fella. Say, you must be Trigger, Junior. You know, your daddy was my best friend. He never told me about you, though. Guess he didn't have a chance. How about a kiss? I hope the folks in there are as friendly toward me as you are. I'm gonna need a lotta help.

And Stormy, you did a swell job of raisin' this little fella. He's a dandy. Only one better. All right, get your hands up. Don't make a move, Rogers, because you're covered. You're coming back with me and this time it's gonna be for ten years. Stormy, I'm glad your father isn't alive today. Why he'd be ashamed to see his daughter aiding a fugitive and a murderer. That's my business. If it happens again, it'll be my business. I'm surprised you thought you could get away with this. Now, get that horse saddled up. We're headin' back for jail. - [gun shot] - Sheriff! I'm sorry, Stormy, but you saw what happened. It's a plain case of self-defense. We all saw him draw on you. [sheriff] How is he? We'll get a buckboard and take him back to town. Well, that just about does it, Jeff. Want to thank you again for gettin' me this posse and takin' care of this criminal. Aah, it was a pleasure, sheriff. I only did what any law-abiding citizen would've done. Well, I won't need you or the posse any longer. You can all go back to town. And thanks. Are they gone yet? Yes, Roy. Foy, you and the boys follow 'em. Keep a lookout and warn us if they start to come back. [Foy] All right. - Doin' all right, Roy? - I think I'll live. How about a cup of coffee, sheriff? Fine. Gee, Roy, you made that fall so real I was afraid I forgot to put in the blanks. I'm sure glad you didn't forget. I still think I oughta have my head examined. If this little scheme of yours doesn't work out, I'm gonna look awful silly. You said this morning you didn't know why Middleton spent so much money for Trigger then turned him loose. This is why: that herd of wild horses can run on either side of the border without causin' any excitement. Sometimes they're south and sometimes they're north, but right now they're south. That's right, sheriff. We checked on them and they were headed that way a week ago. Have you made arrangements with the Mexican authorities? Mm-hmm. They'll do their part before the herd leaves. I told 'em everything we know. All right, we get the horses where are the diamonds? Saddlebags? [chuckling] Well, I'm not sure, but they're on 'em some place. You know, Roy, after that little talk in jail this morning, I'm really convinced that the brains of this organization is right on this side of the border. I thought you'd see it that way. That's where Stormy comes in, if it's a deal. [sighs] Oh, I'm in it so deep now it's a deal. Set 'em up, Spud, the drinks are on the house. OK. Take the men down on the border before morning. You can pick up the herd at Los Alamos Gap. What time do you figure the horses'll be comin' through? Well, they'll be turnin' 'em loose at dawn. Oughta take 'em a couple of hours to get there. Now this is a big shipment so be careful. OK, Jeff. I'll get the boys goin' as soon as they've had a couple of shots. Come on, Spud, I'm thirsty. Hey, boss. Mr. Middleton, I've got to talk to you. After last night's performance, I shouldn't think you'd have anything to say. But this is very important. It's about Roy. Is there some place we could talk in private? Rogers, huh? Come on in my office. Now what's this all about? I've been thinking over what you said last night. You were right, my father would be ashamed of me for associating with criminals. So I've come to apologize and confess. Confess? Confess what? Everything that happened last night was just an act to make you think Roy was shot so he could escape. But the Sheriff shot him. I know he did. I don't understand it myself. They were only blanks. After you left, Roy got up and had a talk with the sheriff. What about? Well, I don't know, I couldn't hear them. I'm glad you told me this. This time, we'll do the shooting. Thanks very much for coming by, Stormy. I'll see you later. All right, Mr. Middleton. Hello, operator, give me long distance and hurry. The herd's already gone? [chuckles] That's great. You wanta see me, Jeff? Yeah, just a minute. Yeah? Anything wrong? Everything! Don't leave that phone, I may need you. - Trouble? - Yeah, plenty. Rogers and that sheriff double-crossed us. I've got to get to Ben before the herd comes thru. - How did you find out about it? - From Stormy. Ah, how do you know she was tellin' the truth? Because of the way the sheriff captured Rogers. It was too easy. It was all a plant. What about the shipment? I've just got time to pick Ben up. He should have the diamonds by then and I'll keep heading south. Stick around that phone in case anything comes up. I'll meet you down there later. Remember, boys, only those marked with an "X." Let's go! [men shouting] [horse whinnies] [tires screech] What's the matter, Jeff? Hurry it up! Listen, I gotta pay you fellas off in diamonds - and then we gotta split up and clear outta here. - Aah, great. - Shall I give the signal? - In just a minute. Sand! Yeah we've been double-crossed. Yeah. Somebody's been double-crossed but I'm not sure who. All right, let's go. All of you put your hands up! Get down, Stormy, till the boys close in. [gunfire continues] End o' the line! Here's the last one, sheriff. Well, Roy, you sure figured right. This just about cleans things up. Not quite. I still have to find Trigger. He just led the wild herd through here, he can't be very far. Roy, Trigger's been running wild. Please be careful. Don't worry, Stormy, I will. Let's go, Junior. [whinnies] [both whinny] Trigger. Hey, here they come! I'll bet Jeff Middleton never dreamed we'd be using Trigger to bring in the whole herd. Take a good look at your daddy, Junior. Maybe some day you'll be as good a horse as he is. [whinnies] Got that thing in gear, Sparrow! Let's get outta here. [Trigger whinnies]
