It was pretty clear at the end of six that Chris had had enough. He'd been very successful in Brittas and there was an interview in one of these science fiction magazines which said wild horses wouldn't drag him back. And then, Rob and I split up. After series six, when Rob and Doug split up, it did feel like that was it. You know, we wouldn't be doing any more. We were thinking, "What's going to happen now? Is this the end?" Erm, I just... It got so that we weren't doing anything else except Red Dwarf. We were doing the novels, we were doing the TV show, we were doing the American version, and in between we were sort of looking over games and all kinds of things. And I just felt like I'd had enough of that. I wanted to do something else. It was something that Rob had suggested several times throughout our writing career. The first time, I think, was just before we went into the studios to record the very first series of Red Dwarf. And the second time was right about season four. And then the last and final time was some time after six when we were doing the series for ITV called The 10%ers. It's the pressure of knowing night after night I've got to go out there and give the performance of my life. You can do it. I know you can. Go on, Charles. Go out there and knock them dead. And an area of low pressure will sweep down from the north... Also, during that time, I went... The show had won an Emmy award and Rob Grant and I flew to New York to receive it from Tony Curtis, which was a great thrill. And I was on a plane with Rob, and in a hotel, and spent days and days with him. And he wouldn't tell me what it was, Bobby. No. No one's really explained to me properly what went on. They were together so long, you know, since they were small boys, you know. So the whole thing's slightly weird. I'm sure people want to know what the reason was. Erm, and if anyone ever finds out, give me a ring. I mean, I think, basically, when Rob felt under pressure, he felt, erm... that if he was writing on his own, that pressure would go away. We were actually writing the third Red Dwarf novel.. And he just wanted to write on his own. So he suggested that he wrote one chapter and I would write a chapter and then he would write the next one and I would write... And we tried that for a while, but it didn't work. And then we kind of ran out of time and we'd been commissioned to write a series for Carlton. And Rob then said, "Okay, well, I think we should write separate episodes.” Which didn't thrill me because neither of us had written before. And there is... I felt we were honour bound to produce a really good series. The first rule of being a good agent is what? Never get caught. Never sleep with a client. Now, it's come to my attention that in your case, this is not true. who told you that? It was Tracy Higgs, wasn't it? -No, it was not. -Gemma Smith? It's not important who told me. Not the Swaine sisters, the little minxes? Mary Dixon. I don't mean to pry, but I have to ask has this ever happened before? NAYLOR: So I wrote three, he wrote three. People wanted him to... do some rewrites on his and he didn't want to. Er, and left. And then... I was then suddenly solely in charge of the thing and having to produce either a new script or a vastly rewritten script. One a week for, I think it was four weeks. So, that was an interesting time. And also I did a series called 7 - Camcorder for Grant Naylor Productions, which was... You know, it had started out as a Rob and Doug idea... There are a few basic rules which crop up from time to time, like a sense of direction. They just came out of the tent and exited from the screen on the left-hand side. Like me. And the next time you see us, we should enter from the right-hand side of the screen. But if I go out this side... and reappear this side, people get confused. They begin to hate you and this is how wars start. I was at their office a lot at that time, so I would then sort of be there working on the script with that. And then, you know, Doug would be there pacing around, worrying. And then Rob would walk in with lawyers and you were going, "What's going on?" You know, it was all kind of... It got quite... I never knew what was going on. I don't know, I was never... I used to look at them through the partitioned screen in the office and try to lip-read them. "I want all the money." "You can't have it." "You bastard." LLEWELLYN: Because of the state the show was in when he decided he didn't want to write any more, it caused a big problem. Because clearly the BBC wanted to make more, the fans wanted more. It was a successful show, you know, so it was a very... It was just... His timing wasn't spot on. So, I started to try and put the team back together. With Rob, that wasn't successful. The first thing I did was get Ed. I thought that it was important to get Ed because Ed had always been... He's a great comedy director. He's very funny outside of the show. So I met up with Doug for a drink somewhere in Soho. It was a long drink. Red Dwarf always needs a sort of leader 'cause, you know, when myself and the others, you know, stand around and want to get the anecdotes out of the way for five hours before we actually start doing any work, you know, you need someone to say, "Right, we're going to start work. Now." It was remarkably unexciting in the respect that it felt like I'd never been away. Do you know what I mean? There wasn't one party popper when I came back. And then we went off to see Chris, to see exactly how he felt. I had been working incredibly hard for the best part of six years, er, doing two series a year. Brittas Empire and Red Dwarf. My thought was, "We don't want Chris just not to be there anymore. "We want to write him out "if he's no longer going to be in the series.” So, we went to go and see Chris before series seven, pretty sure that he really didn't want to be part of it. And then, you know, we were pleased that he did. He did want to be a part of it. And so, we got him for as much as we could. At that point, I really did need to... just to sort of wash my hands of sort of heavy-duty TV work for a while. I think, at this stage, we all started to realise that our whole lives would be defined by this bleeding show. Do you know what I mean? And... And you're either comfortable with that, or you're not comfortable with it, you know? Around series five and six, there certainly were production problems. Problems somewhere around the management level, frankly, that made things, made life on the floor in rehearsals and getting the show shot more stressful than they probably needed to be. Chris had got used to the way Brittas was shot. It was a much more conventional sitcom. With Red Dwarf we were constantly trying to, you know... push things are far as they could be pushed. And when you've got animatronics, when you've got blue screen, when you've got those kind of special effects, it's kind of like making a mini-movie without the money. What that means is you haven't got the preparation time. That's where you save the money. And so when things go wrong, when they break down, erm, people are hanging around. It's no one's fault. Everyone's, you know, working their nuts off and they do from day one to the final day. But for an actor, yeah, you are hanging around. He just wanted to show up, do his lines, go home and everyone wanted that but it just wasn't physically possible. Plus we're all difficult people, you know? we've all got our own idiosyncrasies, you know? we're all very much... parts of our character, you know? JOHN-JULES: That was the make-or-break series, I think. Would it work with, you know, one character missing? Would it work with one writer missing? You know, would it work with the audience missing? All these things were thrown at us in one go. One of the strains on Red Dwarf is the strains on the writing. It's a tough gig to write. Actually, it's simple maths. There's only one writer now as opposed to two so we needed to get some others in. It's a great idea and it worked to a certain degree. But, like I said earlier, you can't just walk into Red Dwarf. You've got to sort of breathe it a bit and live it a bit. And it's difficult even for writers just to fall into it and engage into it. There's a huge difference between overlooking a script and even rewriting it in bits and pieces, to genetically producing the core idea yourself. For new writers, I mean, it's just a job. There are a certain number of rewrites they're happy to do. Generally, it's about three. And then it's, hey, they want to move on and do the next thing. when it's your own thing, there's no Limit to the number of rewrites you do. You just will rewrite and rewrite until there is no more time to rewrite. The original idea was that there would be a lot more writers than there actually were. And so it was actually quite a small team in the end. It was me and Kim Fuller and James Hendrie. Having other writers, I felt that it was maybe not a good idea because it was a step into the unknown. I didn't... I hadn't worked with other writers so I couldn't guarantee how it would work. But equally, I would have just looked like a complete arrogant idiot to go, "No, I don't even want to go down that alley. I just want to write them on my own." It must have been incredibly hard for Doug. I mean, I can't imagine now, looking back. I was so worried about what I was doing, my little bit, that I didn't really take into account what he would have been going through. But it must have been a very hard transition for him, to go from that really well-tried writing partnership that clearly worked incredibly well. We decided to bring a new Kochanski in... and not replace Rimmer, which would have been the sensible thing to do if we hadn't been planning to make the movie. If I had replaced Chris, then it would have been, "Bye-bye, Chris." There would have been no Chris for the movie because he wouldn't have come back. I'm convinced of that. So we had to leave that kind of, vacant, that role. Everybody was totally professional, whether they saw it as a good thing or not. You know, we always supported "the team". I mean, I quite like Clare Grogan. I think she's a lovely lady. But I don't think she was ever that popular with the writers. For the audition, what I read at the audition, she was very... Quite strict. Very, very intelligent, which is a challenge. And very professional. And bossy, which I am. It just felt right. I just wanted to say sorry for the "Dear John". It was cowardly. What "Dear John"? Oh, that. I'd completely forgotten. It seems like years ago. It was last week. I remember we were auditioning her, she's sitting on a sofa, and I went, "Yes, this girl is funny and she can act. That's great." And she looks great. I just wanted to see if we could be friends, that's all. You haven't answered any of my email and I just hate not being liked. I'm a like-junkie. Ed had shot a series with Jasper Carrott called The Detectives. And he'd shot it in a different way. It had been shot without an audience on video, but it was single-camera. Without the restriction of the audience, you can do much more with lighting, you can be much more adventurous. So we thought we'd try that. So, it would look much more sumptuous. It would look much more like film. And this would be terrific practice for when we came to shoot the film. And, of course, Red Dwarf was a show that, up to series seven anyway... had about 20 minutes, sometimes, of a show... done pre-record anyway. And you had time to look at your script and make sure you knew that bit 'cause you were only doing that bit. You were only doing this little bit. Four lines. And you walk in... And that was it. You could have a cup of tea! It was like, "Yes, this is so good." It also gave something else and that is you could do... a slightly more different, more dramatic, I guess, kind of performance because you have the time to sort of... work with it. But I think, you know, by halfway through the entire series, I really missed the audience because, I think, all of us came from a live performance background. So, when there was a crowd in... The flip-side of it was we all raised our game when there was a crowd in. There was a lot of talk about how it wouldn't have the right dynamic or the same dynamic that they'd been used to before. I don't think necessarily that during the filming you noticed that. But certainly, we hired a studio at Teddington to show the whole series in front of an audience over two days, I think. And that was very difficult. Sometimes the audience would laugh over the feed line and completely miss the gag, you know? That's what's good about doing it with a live audience 'cause you can wait. If they've laughed over the feed, you can wait and sort of, you know, look around and stuff like that and then deliver your punch line. But you can't do that if it's all ready been filmed. The audience actually did react very well but it was a very difficult dub for the dubbing mixer afterwards to try and get the audience reaction in the right places and at the right levels. You're like the "before" bit for about 900 Clearasil commercials. I love the look of series seven. Because, to me, the first episode in particular I thought, "Holy cow! It looks like The X-Files. Fantastic." Red Dwarf tended to lean itself towards production value so we thought, "Here's a way to inject a bit more." The format was slightly different because Rimmer had gone off, or was going off, and Kochanski was coming in. And it was being shot much more like a movie. It was all single-camera. It's not comparing like with like. It's comparing something that's sort of, the 2.1 version with the, you know.... It's like the software has evolved. Oh, God. Model shots on seven. Man, what a mess that was. At that stage of the game, CG was... in a really fluid, experimental area. CGI had really... finally become accessible to low-budget programmes, or lower budget programmes. And as a result, we certainly did investigate, erm, what was possible. And myself and Rocky and Paul McGuinness all went on a course, and started to learn the new technology. And at the same time, the sister department of visual effects, which was termed Video Effects or Electronic Effects, were also investigating digital technology. So you had two departments that had always been very separate suddenly, sort of, colliding with this new technology. The three-year gap between series six and series seven had actually meant that the effects department, the actual fabric of the building, we had moved twice. In that relocation, they lost their special model stage, which had been custom built for them, which is where we shot most of the rest of the series from series three onwards. Instead of making it in London, at the BBC, they decided to come to Shepperton. Which made sense because the main production's shot there. So we could theoretically be alongside them and communication wouldn't be a problem. We ended up in a studio space a quarter of the size that we'd been used to. So immediately, we're struggling for space. We had three weeks in there, but the first three days of that three-week block, which is actually 15 shooting days, was taken up blacking out the studio and rigging up stuff we'd had previously in the special model stage. So, effectively, on the first day of the shoot, we were already three days behind. The models had become incredibly expensive because suddenly they had to... They were a self-contained department that had to make money so the prices went up. And we were in the ironic situation of making a show for the BBC and we couldn't afford the BBC to help us make the show for the BBC. And we simply couldn't afford to shoot 35mm. We couldn't afford to shoot motion control. TYLER: Motion control is great if you're doing something in space which is flying along in a sort of elegant fashion and we use motion control when we want toe mat a background in as well. Because you can programme a computer with a camera move and then repeat that move on the background planets and stars and then put the two together. Without access to that, we had to resort to fly-by-wire on almost everything. In fact, I think every shot in Red Dwarf VII was fly-by-wire. Which, again, if you've got the time to keep shooting and keep shooting and keep shooting until you've got a really good take, is the way that you can get some quite elaborate and unusual moves. But again, we were up against time-scale. We just had to just, you know, "Right. That's it. Move on. Next set. In it comes.” I said to Peter Wragg, the visual effects supervisor, "We can't shoot on 35mm anymore. We just simply can't afford it." So we went to 16mm, which is one-fifth as cheap. You do lose quality, obviously, because you've got about a quarter of the negative area. And back then, the film stocks weren't really as good as they are now. The high-speed stock, which we tend to use for model filming, was a little bit grainy and lacking in definition. So obviously there was a visible drop in quality without us even doing anything. And then the other decision they made, which is beyond nuts, was they decided to wrap halfway through the series. So they were finished and we were still shooting. Now, that's just crazy. So, if there were any tweaks, rewrites, changes, when you look at it in the edit and you go, "Actually, we need a shot that does this," not only weren't they there, they were actually, physically off in different places doing other jobs. There was no money. They had also spent the money. So it was like, "what do we do?" I think there was about four or five weeks before they delivered to the BBC and I ended up taking the animation that I had done up to the edit suite, where they were finishing off series seven at the time, and showed that to Doug and Ed and they kind of looked at it, and there was a sort of sequence of planet Earth and there was a light flying past towards the planet and they were kind of going, "Can you put a spaceship in there instead?" If we hadn't used Chris, there would have just been black or missing bits, or stories that just didn't make sense. I sort of understand why a lot of that happened because the script had evolved to the point where what we'd shot was no longer suitable for the story that was being told. It's just that at the point we'd shot them, that was what was needed. And I think the business of having the model work done in the middle... Root of most of the problems. The series was seen by the hardcore fans as, you know, not what we're used to. You know, a lot of people actually that I sort of heard from thought it was too glossy, too good, too clean. You know, they wanted to see those egg cartons wavering in the wind. To me, I thought it looked great. But I don't know if the audience... I think the audience were in love with the sitcom and this was more of a comedy-drama than a situation comedy. So, I think series seven... didn't get the initial reaction that I think it deserved. You know, I think people were put off by the change of style and the change of direction. But looking back in hindsight, some of our best work's on series seven, I think, you know? -You guys said Kennedy was a great pres. -He was. He was also an inveterate womaniser. His affairs were legendary. They never came out when he was alive. Every man has his weak spot, his Achilles heel. Kennedy's was just higher up. Well, you know, as conspiracy theories go, I mean, it's just as valid as all the others. And also plausible. I actually think it really happened. I think the crossover between the comedy and the storytelling worked really well in that episode. KRYTEN: Kennedy was sentenced to three years in an open prison in July '65. # Edgar Hoover became President. He was forced to run by the mob, who had pictures of him at a transvestite orgy. If Kennedy hadn't been assassinated, it was quite possible that... what happened in the script could have happened. So it wasn't just wacky and crazy and made up. LLEWELLYN: Michael Shannon, who played Kennedy, was just spooky when he was lit properly. And he had the voice really well, sort of chillingly well. It's such a poignant voice, I think, for that generation. You mean, assassinate myself? Yeah, it'll drive the conspiracy nuts crazy but they'll never figure it out. Yeah, I was talking about having more considered performances, been able to let the performances breathe, not always going for the comedy, you know. I mean, I think that's one of the great things about American sitcoms is that they allow for sad moments in their comedies. It doesn't always have to finish with a massive big laugh, you know? There was quite an interesting thing when PBS called the Dallas TV stations and said, "Have you seen the first Red Dwarf show that's going out?" And they went, "No, we haven't seen it yet." And they said, "We think you should take a look." And in fact, they had one complaint from their viewers which was about the cannibal scene, which they thought was offensive. I suppose one of my biggest memories on that is finding Farnborough airfield. We had to find an empty building that looked sort of '50s, '60s and a space where we could park all the cars and, you know, make it look like an empty street scene which is actually quite difficult to create anywhere in London. Which is one of the reasons why we did use a lot of locations out at Farnborough. There's this huge runway and down at the bottom, where the planes start, not where they end, so it's safe, there's all these buildings round the bottom. We had to do quite a long sort of dénouement-type shot, a four-hander, talking together. But I just remember it was a long shot, next to an airport at rush hour and that means tricky. Vegetarian, single... (AEROPLANE ROARING OVERHEAD) There's somebody up in the control tower listening on our radios. "He hasn't said action yet. Hang on. He said action. Go!" The actual assassination JFK sequence was done on a test track at Chobham, which is another area which is just vast and is empty that we could use to do these, either the car actually going past and all the FBI agents running by the side of the car. And, you know, we obviously had a lot of supporting artists. A lot of characters on that side street... You know, we tried as best as possible to match to the stock footage. But I also remember we had to build part of that set in the car park at Shepperton, which we used many times actually behind G stage. It didn't half look like Dallas, though. The footage of the assassination is like, "Where did they get this colour footage?" Because it kind of looks spot on. There's a danger of overdoing it then it just looks like it's stock. In fact, at one point Ed wanted to make it all black and white. And to me, it looked like the real footage. And I showed it to a few people and they went, "God, how have you got the real footage?" We wanted to make it look authentic but still keep it within the realms of Red Dwarf If you go off to stock footage then you're suddenly going, "I'm not engaged in the story anymore." We were looking for locations, always looking for locations... and that location came up. And it was Cliff Pinnock, I think, who was the location manager. He said, "Look, I don't know if this is any good to you, but look at this.” And we went... It was actually the place where they tested the Concorde engines, it was the most fantastic-looking place, a lethal place to stand in at full pelt. And that's one of the times when you actually go, "Okay, let's find something to put in it." It was basically a great big propeller in a tube. But the propeller must have been 30 or 40 feet high. And you could see the kind of splats, of presumably insects or something, on the walls of this perfectly round white thing. And it blows wind around itself at, I think, 5,000 miles an hour. It can... So, you know, you wouldn't last long. There's nothing to hang on to. There's no handles. BENNETT: And we did have a problem there. I think we used dry ice at one point, when there's a scene where the cast are walking towards camera. It wasn't flat so that with four of them walking towards camera, some of them were walking up on a level and one of them slipped over, I think the cameraman slipped over, because the dry ice made it very slippery. It was quite a sort of eerie place to be, but I think the lighting job on it was brilliant. And again it just shows what sort of level we were trying to achieve towards those last series. We suddenly went, "God, this is a sitcom. "We're doing a BBC sitcom that looks like this?" When you saw the footage coming back, you go, "My God! "That would not shame Ridley Scott with a $10 million budget for the day." BYE: Basically, it was a real, top corridor shot. Let's be honest It could have been done in a corridor! But it was fine, thank you very much, in a whacking great wind tunnel. I've always been a bit of a technical whizz when it comes to these kind of gizmos. There were some props that were gonna be carry-over, and the time-drive being one of those, we'd obviously seen it destroyed at the end of series six by Rimmer. But the new script, it was obvious that we couldn't just use the same thing. It had to be portable. And it seems to fling them back and forth in space as well as time. I went to a convention, a Red Dwarf convention, and I thought, "I'm gonna be God here. Everyone's gonna adore me." And I arrived at the convention and a man came up to me and said, "The time-drive can take you from one time to another, "but you cannot move location." I said, "Yeah, but the time-drive is broken. "Kryten didn't know how to operate it properly." "You broke the rules of the time-drive, "you completely ruined my enjoyment of the series and I've never watched Red Dwarf again." And that was the first thing that somebody said as I walked into the convention. And I thought, "But we made the time-drive up. It's just a lump of plastic. "Hello? Hello?" Bastard. Stoke me a clipper. I'll be back for Christmas. Whatever. We thought that... you know, if Chris is going to go, let him go in the way he likes it best, as Ace. I wanted to do an Ace Rimmer episode as the final one for Chris. And I wanted to do a big, huge hero-like opening sequence. That was as good a way to leave the show as any, really. It was very poignant. Lots of sort of... As emotional, I suppose, as you get in Red Dwarf. In a way, it could be one of the writers, couldn't it? He's, you know, your buddy... (Whistles) Me and Chris, by this time were friends, you know. We'd not been great mates through some of the earlier series, but we'd all sort of grown up then. And so it was quite sad, you know, seeing him go. Stoke Me A Clipper went through so many variations on script that we simply didn't know what we were building from one day to the next. And the big opening sequence, jumping out of a bomber on the back of a crocodile, we had started work on Ace Rimmer fighting Simulants, jumping out of a battle cruiser on the back of an alien. And then it's, "Oh, no, everything changed." So again, another process where we'd started work, everything got pushed to one side and quickly we need a crocodile. Scripts were given to their department and for whatever reason, they weren't handed around to the people who worked in that department. I don't know why, but they weren't. And so they weren't aware of changes. A lot of it came from me and Doug and Ed sitting in a room together and whenever you get three sexy, virile middle-aged men in a room together, they end up talking about James Bond. And we always did that, no matter what storyline we were meeting about, we ended up talking about James Bond. And so the idea came up that we'll make the opening like a James Bond-cum-Indiana Jones film opening. And whilst we were filming that, the Queen actually came and landed. Well, she didn't land the plane, but she landed at Northolt. And she must have thought it was quite bizarre. All these strange World War II people, Nazis running around. BURDEN: It was, you know, authentic-looking German Nazi uniforms. But, I mean, that's the mad thing about Dwarf You never know what you're going to be asked for. I think Ed chucked in the idea of, you know, body surfing the crocodile. I think it was Paul Alexander who said you can't do that. And I said, "Yes, you can. A crocodile could catch a thermal. Of course it could.” It just so happened that there was a crocodile mould in the department. So we were able to get a large, life-size, relatively realistic foam rubber crocodile out of the moulds. I remember being on location when we were shooting the crocodile and just looking in the van. And it was sort of like, "That's a crocodile. "That's a really, really bad plastic crocodile. "We won't be using that then, obviously. That's not our crocodile, is it?" Looking around for another really good animatronic crocodile that looks like a crocodile. "No, that's the crocodile we'll be using, then." I think Ed and Doug both thought it looked like a big, rubber crocodile and was a bit expressionless and lifeless. But crocodiles don't actually have a lot of expression. So we ended up going back in and building in things like lips curling. Crocodiles don't have lips. And it's a shame because it made the whole opening sequence, like, so cheesy. So unbelievably cheesy. And I guess on Red Dwarf sometimes you're covered in that sense when sometimes, when we just do stuff that's really, really bad, people think it's a brilliant parody. And we're taking the mickey out of, you know, whatever, when it's just bad. It's one of those things, you have to try and make it live as you're struggling with it, you know, because it was just a piece of latex. And it's got to be, you know, getting the better of me. It brought puppeteering to a new level, frankly. (PLAYING FANFARE) That's Doug again at his best. We were recceing for the German sequence... with Ace Rimmer and he phoned me up, he said, "I think we need something else and I've had this idea." And it comes straight out of left-field. But, you know, as you listen to it, you think, "Yeah, man, that's a fantastic idea." The medieval sequence was the bane of my life. It took us a very long time to actually source... a company who actually, you know, do medieval jousting as a hobby. They were real, they weren't extras. They were actual real people from the medieval period. They actually spend the rest of their time in a gallery in Holland in a Pieter Brueghel painting. BURDEN: They really made an effort. I mean, they do sort of, you know, really get info it. Some of it, the period details, not quite. But then, we weren't making a documentary. It was... BYE: That was the weird day of filming, where it rained and rained and rained and rained. And it rained all day. It's unusual in Britain for it to rain all day. But it rained all day. I got up in a sunny place and got in a sunny car. And it was bright sunshine. I put dark glasses on. And you drove out in the beautiful sunny countryside and it was clear sky in the summer. And then as we arrived at the field where we were filming and drove onto the field and there was all the people and the buses, there was this cloud. Literally, you could see it. It was like the spaceship in Independence Day. It was just hanging over... And it bucketed down rain, just on us. And you could look in any direction, you'd see cows in sunny fields and children having picnics. It was so cruel. Towards the end of the shoot, I remember looking at Robert sitting on a horse. I said, "You all right?" And he went, "I don't think I can really go on much longer." I said, "what do you mean?" And he pressed his face and water came out of his eyes and his ears, his nose and his mouth. Like that. Chain mail and water don't go. Especially when it's not real chain mail. It's just bits of mop, right, which are extra absorbent. Which have been, sort of, knitted together and sprayed silver. And the donkey ran off and wouldn't be caught. We couldn't get out of the field. The wardrobe vehicle was so heavy and it got so bogged down in mud, we were actually pushing the vehicles out of the field to get out. And I swear that cloud moved back over West London with Ed. It just followed him. This bloke, he was all sitting like that, all dripping. I just remember him in his wet anorak, which wasn't waterproof. "Look, it's all gone through. I'm soaked." He was so depressed. Yes, we had to re-shoot with Brian Cox because it was so windy and wet that the canopy had water leaking down it. You know, it's not very king-like to have a stream of water splatting down all over the place. And it was very windy, you couldn't hear properly. So we had to re-shoot his sequences, yeah. In a car park in Shepperton. Where I believe Howard Burden, our costume designer, did a little double for him. Yeah, I looked great. All those Rimmers. They all did it. They all become Ace and passed on their flame. Are you really going to be the one to break the chain? I think the original script finished just with the funeral and I think it was pretty much Doug's idea that they'd shoot out Ace's coffin and it would go into all these other coffins, then you pull back, you see it was the rings of the planets, it was fantastic. There was a whole end sequence which... is one of the reasons really why I want to do films. When Rimmer's pod joins the Saturnian ring... and, you know, in a movie version, that would have just been, you know, terrific, breathtaking. But with the budgets that we get and blah blah, people are going, "Oh, look at that little CGI pod clinking about." And it takes away from the moment, which is a shame. We were scoring the music for it with Howard... and he did this amazing piece of orchestral, moving, climactic moments with changing chords on string tones, which were, you know, incredibly difficult bits of orchestral work. And it was very, very moving, all this stuff with the music. And I remember Doug and I actually going, "Christ, I hope we can match that." I mean, that was sort of how that worked. (SWEEPING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) With us going round and round in time, the human race can never become extinct. We're like a kind of holding pattern. I was actually just sitting around the office one day and there was a picture of this, you know, little black baby. "Black" being the operative word. Meaning very dark. I go, "who's this?" He said, "Oh, that's the baby that's gonna be playing Lister." I said, "But, uh, Lister's about 15 hues lighter than this." You know, this is like Gary wilmot being played by Sidney Poitier. Right? So, I said, "And, you know, he hasn't got the fat cheeks." I said, "My brother's baby looks more like Lister than this guy.” So, I brought a picture of my brother's baby in, with the fat cheeks, and he did look more like Lister than... old young Sidney. And they whine more than Danny. Stopping that kid crying was just... Thanks, Dan. Any note? (BABY BAWLING) But it was crying because we were sticking the dreadlocks on with drawing pins. You can't really do that now. I just thought the whole snake that eats its tail circle thing was interesting. And the idea of Lister being the father of himself seemed to fit 'cause he was never going to have just, you know, regular parents. I mean, that's not interesting. And that just seemed to work for me. It's not something Rob and I had ever discussed, but it just seemed to fit into the world. I have to say that Ouroboros was one of those episodes where, from when I read the script until well after we finished shooting it, I had no idea what it was about. The idea of a parallel universe, or the idea that there's a... an ongoing existence which is running happily at the same time as your own, but you can only link to it occasionally, was the most alluring. To get her from another dimension, basically. It is real science. David Deutsch has well documented that there is, you know, alternative dimensions. Every decision that we make creates another dimension. And they all exist in parallel simultaneously. So, I mean, I've always found that absolutely fascinating. It allowed her to have knowledge of all the characters, but at the same time be a stranger. I remember we did a lot of, you know, visualising a lot of designs for her. And so it was very much. .. Sort of design by committee. And the costume, which was gonna be Emma Peel, and it was like, "Fine, Emma Peel works for me. A new Emma Peel. Yeah, that could work." It was a good costume. I mean, it must have been hellish hot to wear. Luckily, I never wore it, but... Not in public anyway. It was very shiny. I remember we had a lot of trouble with it on blue screen. Craig and Dan and I had to stand behind her and do acting and all we could do was like... You know. So I said, "Look, Doug, I'm gonna get out of the way now." So I just knelt down behind her with her arse there and I'm like... And I looked at it until I was bored. She changed the pants, I think, at one point because they weren't comfortable and the new pants just expanded. It would swell during the day, it would mould to the shape of your bottom by the end. By 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon, you know, it was saggy. And so, physically, she didn't feel confident. And she was... Played someone much more uptight than had been written. You mean, I'm stuck here with you? Priscilla, Queen of Deep Space? Also, there was no reward for her. There was no reward of the audience. And the audience made a huge difference to her on eight when it's like, "Whoa, they're laughing at me," and she kind of chills out. And we got rid of some of the worst aspects of the uptightness, the costume, the hair, and just the sheer experience of working with the guys, which I have to say, she adored from day one. When I first saw her, I mean, I was quietly sort of anxious for her in a kind of paternalistic, sexist way. "The little lady could be a little bit shocked by some of the things we say." Boy, was I wrong. My thoughts were mainly, "What is Red Dwarf going to be like without Rimmer?" You know, I just thought maybe this is just going to fly away and they'll never need Rimmer again. Miss Kochanski, ma'am. I don't suppose you've read my proposal for a new Space Corps salute. -Rimmer. -Yes, ma'am? -Have sex with someone and that's an order. -Yes, ma'am. Right away. That was really nerve-racking. But everybody was friendly. But it did show... and what was with my hair? I looked like Elvis! A lot of it was done against blue screen and I remember thinking, "How the hell do they know, you know, "how they're responding to themselves over this sort of a gap that isn't very far away?" There was a lot of left and right business going on. People shaking each other's hands, who were themselves. Things like eye-lines have to be plotted around the studio so there'd be big crosses taped to cameramen's heads. The others probably had a total professional understanding of what was going on, but I was like, "What? We're in a tube? "What, like toothpaste? No? What are we doing? Why is it wobbling?" I mean, they asked me to do this big jump, leap. Which for Craig would've been a piece of cake. He'd love it all. But suddenly, there was a girl on board, you know, bit of a sissy girl on board, too. "I'm not doing that! I might hurt myself." I think it was so cruel, a cruel initiation. "On your first day, you'll be wearing a beautiful long dress, "and you'll do dancing with a beautiful prince." No, you'll hang by your waist from a very painful wire and we'll shoot a crossbow through your thigh. Shooting Kochanski through the leg. Now, if you couldn't see the big cushion that's underneath her tight PVC, that would have worked really well. Whether I was psychic or whether it was just luck, I'd actually taken large format stills of the second Red Dwarf model, in its lighting set-up, before we blew it up. He then stuck that on a stand, in front of camera, upside-down. He then put a bit of glass in front of the camera, projected an image of Jupiter onto that, smeared the edge of that with Vaseline to give the glow to the planet, hung the model of the white midget against black, upside-down, and reflected that into the scene via a semi-silvered mirror. So, that entire sequence is done in-camera just with very, very old-fashioned '50s movie-making techniques. LLEWELLYN: Sometimes, when we were rehearsing, we would do entire scenes about the crew being hit by the gay ray. You know, camp Kryten was just like, "Oh, my Lord! "I think we're lost, sir." You're lying! They never wrote that in, but I think there was a bit of reflected gay ray on Kryten after Kochanski arrived. I think he became slightly, just slightly jealous. Not only has he got all this angst and guilt, now he's got jealousy as well. You know, he broke his programming, he can feel emotions. Why's the overriding one jealousy? I love them scenes with me and Robert, you know. I think that's just classic writing. KOCHANSKI: They're right on our tails. We were able to shoot a very nicely, choreographed chase through the icebergs and a crash. And having seen it and knowing that he was back on the set with the same cast, effectively, the following day, Ed sort of said, "The moment where it swings back up "we can shoot a moment where they pull back on the sticks. "At the moment they're turning left, the cast can do a turn left." It did, it worked a treat. If only the rest of the season had that level of attention to detail and communication, it would have been great. Smeg. I've just sneezed out me cap. My cap came out, right. And I couldn't be arsed going to the dentist for dental cement. So I put a bit of super glue in it and stuck it back on, right. Which was okay for a couple of days, but then it started to really hurt. And I've still got a hole there, above my gum, where it kind of split. And I'd go like that every now and again and squeeze out all this stuff. And then it'd go away for a couple of days and then I'd go like that... I always say to actors, you know, "What can you do? Is there anything weird you can do? "Can you juggle kangaroos? Can you, what... "What's really... Can you do a weird thing with your tongue? "Is there something weird you can do with your ears, or something? "Can you ice-skate? what can you do?" And then if they're able to tell you, you can then incorporate that in stories and it just makes the characters more, kind of, three-dimensional. I can remember coming back to my mum one time and saying, "He's very good at writing, Doug, you know, he gets everyone spot on, "but I really don't think he's got me terribly well." My mum would just look at me and go, "Right. Spot on. Spot on." I don't know how he did it. The opera game, how did he know? But it's so awful because... I watched it afterwards and I thought, "God, am I really like that?" Yeah, I'm really like that. Doug does that with our whole lives. Do you know what I mean? I mean, that's why I think some of the stuff, although it's blown up and becomes caricatures of it, I mean... Some of the most bizarre things are based on real-life events. That's what makes them slightly plausible. And that's what makes them work, you know. I hate this, I really hate this. It's a favourite episode of mine and I love what they go through in that thing. I mean, it was those things of sort of, Lister's vulnerability, Lister being scared and not knowing what to do but trying to put on a brave face 'cause there's a girl there, you know. I think it was one of my favourite episodes. It was very like Marooned. Marooned was a two-hander basically, Marooned with me and Chris. Where, you know, you can do dialogue and tell stories and do back stories. You know, just expand the character and tell you a bit more about his history and stuff like that. The relationship between her and Kryten was so tense by that time. He hated her so much by that time. She was so annoyed by him. She was so premenstrual. Those pipes were so awful. You just thought any minute now she's going to... Breaking point. I'm saying this because I know it's not, you know, a well-liked show. And it's interesting just because how it was perceived. It was voted one of the all-time best shows by PBS on a viewer pledge drive. When I came in with the script, and this is the one and only time this has ever happened, the cast applauded. When we shot it and we showed it to the audience, the cast reaction was, "This is the strongest show in this season." The Duct Soup episode was actually a replacement episode for... what would have been "The Cat" episode. It replaced another script which was called "Identity within". It was going to be The Cat has to have sex or he dies. Again, it being my first series of Red Dwarf, I thought, "Is Doug mad? "How? How are we going to achieve this?" It had everything in it that you should be able to achieve if you have a really healthy, fat budget and we didn't. It was quite epic. In my memory it's this epic story that would have cost a fortune to shoot. It had GELFs. It had an entire African village. It had Catwoman. And because it was concentrated on Cat, it meant the other characters were kind of, slightly marginalised, I think. And there was a feeling that although it was really, really good, it wasn't quite right for the series. And the other guys would have been so jealous, we couldn't film it. There would have been a mutiny if the Cat would have got the episode, I think. We needed to do a show that didn't have enormous amounts of complicated design. Because we'd basically run out of money, it was shot entirely in some ducts! Which were in the car park, too, at Shepperton. And I think in collusion with Mel, we said, "We can create something here, "quite cheaply, which will give an impression of something much bigger than it really is." And suddenly there was this thing that we're going to be in this water duct and they're all going to get saturated So it really was... The budget had been spent so we were making it up out of sticky-back plastic and whatever we had to hand. It was really uncomfortable to film, really hot as well, because we were filming in a set that was only that high. It was only sort of hip high. The whole thing was filmed in that so everyone was in these boxes for hours and it does get hot and you're just crawling around on your hands and knees with a rubber head on. The very last shot, I think, of the entire series was when the water comes rushing through the duct and they get pushed against the bars. And we had to do it in the car park because we weren't allowed to have that much water in the studio. It's not safe. Fire brigade, there with the hose pipe, you know. James rigged up some very specific, fish tails they're called, which effectively, as they're named, they're a V-shaped... outlet normally used for gas but if you connect water on them, they'll spray water out as well. These were bolted to the set to give sheets of water and we literally just fired fire hoses at the cast. You did think that all these guys were doing... They worked with you for the last 16 weeks or whatever, were just getting rid of their anger. "I really hated you on this shoot.” LLEWELLYN: It's a special effects thing where they were going to pull us along a trolley with a string and there'd be some water squirting at us. They didn't need to pull us along on the trolley because there's four fire hoses. Fire hoses are really powerful and the fireman really, really enjoying it. 'Cause they didn't get to squirt their hoses as much anymore 'cause not so many things catch fire. They're always cutting people out of cars. So, for once they could get all their hoses out. You could hear the pumps start up. They're reeling, the thing's swaying and they go... The poor old cast had to be trundled backwards and forwards over the same piece of track while we emptied gallons of water on them. LLEWELLYN: We just rocketed along that corridor with staggering amounts of cold water hitting us. I asked them if they could warm it. "Can you make the water warm?" They were using sort of 11,000 gallons in 30 seconds. It's kind of difficult to heat it up with a CALOR gas stove. I tend to always get... put into water in all the things I do. 1 died in water in Blade I died in water in Casualty. Yeah, I tend to always get the fishy roles. So how'd you get to be claustrophobic? Are you born that way or is it because you're kind of sissy? Never knew I had claustrophobia before then. But the story about why I had claustrophobia I thought was hilarious. And that was one take, that was. In the end he relented and I heard the box being opened. I stepped out, bollock naked, right in the middle of Bootle Players' amateur production of The Importance of Being Earnest. Although they had to dub a little... One word in it afterwards. So watch and see what word I dubbed in afterwards. That worked as a fulcrum to be able to story tell, if you see what I mean. And also for the Cat to be very, very funny. Boy, is it cramped! Ooh! I tell you, if I was dead, you most certainly could not swing me around in here. I've missed you, man. And I've missed you too, Listy. -Oh, Arnold, man. -Dave. Don't ever leave us again. Possibly, though he wouldn't admit it, speaking professionally, of course, that Craig probably would have missed Chris. Yeah, that was all made up, man. -Oh, Listy. -Rimmsy. No! Get off! Yes, kissing Craig Charles. That was something you've gotta build yourself up for. They had a long history, those two men, and they clearly relished that moment. There wasn't any of that... I think I've been in other situations, in stage plays and things, where two straight blokes do a kiss. And there's always that kind of jocular... afterwards where they're kind of embarrassed to do that. That didn't happen with Chris and Craig. They were funny. I think they were holding hands for a while afterwards. It was all sort of a bit gooey. It was one of those things where, dare I say it... the foreplay was more exciting... than the actual event. Where have we heard that before? I don't know if I was looking forward to it. I slightly was looking forward to it. And I slightly was scared of doing that scene as well. what are you gonna get? You're going to get a, you know, an ashtray with a little taste of whiskey chucked in with maybe some curry coming along there. All mixed into a whole Craig Charlesian Liverpool-supporting potpourri. They were incredibly professional about the whole thing and weren't the least bit worried about it. And certainly never spoke to me about it. Mind you, I have to say that the word "cut" could have come a little sooner. You know, when you've been kissing someone for what seemed like 28 minutes, you think, "Hang on, I'm sure they've got it by now.” You've just got to try and pick the moment in the edit. You pick the moment where... the audience are at, sort of, their highest point. And then hard cut. You know, after a while you think, "Oh! Stop it. "Stop it now!" Hang on, I just realised I described my kiss with Craig as good. I mean, not that good! But it was fine. I was so tempted to make them do it again. What's happened to the stabilisers? Never mind the stabilisers. Where's the hair mousse? TUCKER: When Blue turned up as a script there's what we thought was a great sequence of Starbug entering the tail of a comet. And Pete came up with the idea of if we have the Starbug suspended nose-up and we have a rig in the ceiling that can drop salt and ice and debris, camera on its side, we can get these fantastic shots of it swinging in and out of the debris field. But obviously the studio we have in Shepperton is too small. So we went onto the main set. We literally went on to where they were filming the live action sets. And then James went up into the grid and rigged a huge great funnel that would drop vermiculite and dust and salt and cork and just rubbish. So, as you're looking up, you get this stream of particles that comes whizzing towards the camera. We only had to stop filming when the matte box on the camera filled up with salt It must be here somewhere. I've been around the planetoid twice. It was a quarry somewhere near Guildford. CHARLES: Not the first time we've been to a quarry in Red Dwarf, is it? Jesus, we go to quarries all the time. That's the moon. No, of course, I'm not a golfer. Even a putting green in Poole at the age of, you know, 15 was just an absolute nightmare for me. There you are, on the day, everyone's setting up the camera and sound and getting, you know, Ed's working out his shots and things. Ed sort of says, "I think you guys should go and practise "because we don't want to spend all day waiting for you guys to get a good shot. Yes? Good." I was thinking, "We seem to be waiting all day for you to get a good shot "so I'll have a little bit of practice." And, of course, the first swing that I do was... It wasn't quite as bad as that. It was... You know, I, for some, reason launched it to, you know, Hampshire. -That's Rimmer's ball, isn't it? -It must have gone right around the planetoid, sir. You know, everyone's saying, "Played this before, have we, Chris?" And the answer, very definitely, was no. Only the little bit of putting green experience on boring holidays. But he looks like a golfer, doesn't he? Do you know what I mean? Bet he's a member of a club. They wouldn't let me in. They'd let me do the greens or something like that. Come to the take, of course, four, five efforts, was it? And the best we managed to get was me swinging, the ball moving a metre, and me going, "Oh..." you know what expletive. -Number 58. -Okay. The jet of flame into Rimmer's face is a very old stage technique called Pepper's Ghost. It's done all with mirrors and reflective glass. A semi-silvered mirror placed at 45 degrees in front of the camera, so you can still view through it, but you can also reflect images into it. And because of the semi-silvered nature of it, you get like a 50-50 mix. Welcome to the Rimmer Experience. A place of wonder, excitement and... wonder. The Rimmerworld Experience was referred to as Black Thursday, whatever day it was. Black Monday, Black Friday, or was it called Black Wednesday? Black Friday? Oh, God, we were all completely pissed off by then. Oh, God, Black Wednesday. That was... Yeah, that was interesting. We was on a circus ride which, you know, added to the tension. You know, occasionally when you're filming, everything goes wrong on a particular day for no particular reason, it just happens. And there was this scene and it was just taking ages. It was that thing where we come in through the doors. We kept having to be wheeled back in this truck. So, of course, everybody in this truck was like this... One more time. You know all those faces like that? We weren't acting there. We'd just all given up. I obviously was going through a different thing compared to the rest of the crew and cast. I'm like, "This is great! Isn't it great?" Black Wednesday? It was a blast! Why was it Black Wednesday? Rimmer had fucked off, right, and here's this whole thing for him, you know what I mean? Sort of this whole celebration of Rimmer. I know what do it. Just give me the action and I'll do it. No. I'm kind of like... Whoo! Well done, Rimmer! You know, he's gone off to greener, greater pastures... and there's us, for the millionth day, in Shepperton Studios... like, working 12-hour days... getting home really late, just learning your lines and up again at the crack of dawn to get back in. By this stage, we'd just had enough. And there was that awful song, right, with Rimmer doing... (HUMMING) And like, oh, God, it was like, it was excruciating. # He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer # Without him, life would be much grimmer # He's handsome, trim and no one's slimmer # He will never need a Zimmer # Possibly, I think, one of the funniest things I've ever been involved with on set because it was so ludicrous. The song was funny. Chris was great. And we have these little marching munchkins. I have to be honest with you, the image was from Crackerjack when I was a kid. The presenters of Crackerjack used to stick their heads through a curtain and they'd have a little body underneath, like that. And whenever I saw that, I just thought it was really funny. So I had to mime to Howard Goodall. It would have been nice to have maybe had a go at the song. I mean, I would have obviously put a lot of Rimmer, you know, real sort of me Rimmer into it. We went out and bought three commercially available, what are now termed "plushy toys", I believe. But they were little soft toys and we ripped the heads off them and we stuck a circular collar... in the top, absolutely rigid, that would give them a very, very clean matte line to put Chris' head onto. And having got these sort of naked puppets, they were all sent off to Howard, who built fantastic replicas of Rimmer's costume in miniature. Yeah, great. Loved them. So I suppose it's a bit of a disappointment that I never got around to singing it, but maybe they thought they'd have to wait as long for my singing to get any good as they did for my golf. If Mamet came in here now, I bet she wouldn't even recognise you. -I've evolved? -You bet. I've become something that's beyond a joke? Too right, man. My whole secret plan, which I don't think I told Doug or Ed about at all, I was keeping it to myself, was that Kryten isn't in the episode. He's got a tiny bit! He's not in it, they have to solve how to get Kryten's head back. They solve it at the end, there's his head. "Oh, thank you, sir." End of episode. So, what is, you know... It's not right. Actors are meant to want to be in the whole thing. But I just thought, "This is brilliant. I can write myself out. "I can have two days off, still get paid." Don't tell anyone! And, you know, I don't have to wear the make-up. And I can watch it as the writer. I sit at the back going, "Can you do that line again? I think I might change it." That was the dream, I think. And that dream died such a death. We kicked around various ideas with him and came up with the idea of, as it were, Kryten meeting another Kryten. Which meant that there are two Krytens! "Oh, we'll have to get someone else to play..." "Well, no, it's cheaper if we put you in it and we put in a different colour." Oh, no! Boy, did he have to work when we shot that! He was all over the place. And, of course, it was split screens and so he had to do all of that stuff. More Krytens. More moaning about the mask. Not only now was it like, just one costume, it's him in two costumes. Now, if he hates wearing the bleeding costume, why does he write himself in as twins in another costume? You're like, "Robert," you know, "What's going on, kid?" The idea that this robot could have anything that resembled a brother, because they were out of the same batch, that tickled me. I think it was from, subconsciously I think, from experience of, you know, the good friends I had who were essentially good and intelligent people, who really stuffed themselves up with substance abuse, you know, where you just wanted to get away from them because it wasn't funny anymore. It wasn't even half good. And it was too late for an individual mate to help them. They needed proper armed professionals. You know, and with doors that locked. You know, it was that kind of, "Oh God..." There's nothing, you can't say, "I'LL tell you what, don't take the rest of that. This isn't a good idea. Have something to eat. "Have a bath and go and see your mum. "And get a job." You know, it's not going to happen. They need to be put in the thing. "You can't have any more!" To Simulants. The greatest droids in the universe. But never trust them, eh? Cheers! I had the chance to work with the great Don Henderson. He was really good and he was a really nice bloke as well, you know. But his throat was going then, wasn't it? Yeah. He was a pleasure to work with, a joy. And a really nice man and a great actor. I thought he looked terrific, actually. He was one of my favourites because he was an eclectic tapestry of just any old bit of stuff of any monster and any bad guy we've had going. Sims hate humans, but they don't hate GELFs. -This is nuts. -We look great! What are you talking about? It automatically makes you just like, "What? What?" In a bad, filthy mood. "What are you looking at?" But what I did do was cornrow my own hair to fit it underneath the GELF costume, which wasn't as uncomfortable as everyone says it was. And I'm dressed like a baboon in a very flammable costume. And I'm standing outside and all the sparks and grips are sitting there smoking fags. "Do you mind? Please." You know. "I'm flammable." These strides are too tackle-tight, Officer BB. I can barely cruise. I can't remember quite where the whole notion of the Jane Austen World originally came from but it was certainly a thing where... I'd been to see one too many long dress films, as I call them. I think there was a kind of explosion of historic film making in the mid '90s. And I kind of developed a little bit of a sort of Oxbridge chip on my shoulder. "If I see another woman in a long dress, I'm going to puke." 1 felt sorry for him because Doug's, you know, Doug's, he's very... pernickety, for a word. when you say Robert wrote it, it's so different from the original that Robert wrote. Going to the Pride and Prejudice Land, what a brilliant idea. I mean, I got to wear that monstrous wig. What is it with my hair in this? We took caricatures, really, and Danny, the Cat, was in some very braided military, big-booted thing with a huge, great bouffant. And Lister, he was a sort of cleric. I was a priest! I didn't even get any of the girls. I was a priest. Danny, the dashing cavalry officer. Here's me... with a Bible... and chops. That's life, yeah. It's good. You need to keep those boys in check. I think it turned out really well. All the stuff with the tank in Jane Austen territory was lovely. I really liked that. Just borrow the T-72 from the WW2 game and then I think we'll have everyone's attention. When I started writing it, knowing that we'd rewrite it and it wouldn't be a tank, it would be a shoulder-mounted bazooka, which was actually a roll of cardboard painted green. That's what it would end up as. And then Doug said, "No, we'll get a tank.” And I was going, "No, what should we really do?" "No, Bobby, we're gonna get a tank!" You're going, "Yes!" It was one of the hottest days in August and there's Kryten coming out of this tank that we borrowed, I think, from the 007 stage. That was another of those classic Red Dwarf things where when you hear "Action", come out of the tank and look around and say, "Dinner is served." "All right. Okay." But you're in a tank which is built for small Russian men so the actual opening is about that wide. And you're in a costume where your shoulders come out to here. So you go like this. Clink! "I can't get out." That's the one thing. The second thing is you can't possibly hear "Action" because you're in a T-72 tank, which is a machine for killing people. So inside, you can't hear your own brains. I had a recurring gripe that when we did explosions, we never did them big enough. They always look "quite good" and not "mega". We were on army property so apparently you can do what you like on army property, you can blow up whatever you like. And when it came to the explosion, we weren't quite sure how big the explosion was going to be so we had a couple of cameras sorted out for wider shots and tighter shots. I said supper is ready. We'd been primed, you know, "There's gonna be an explosion," you know, "so just be warned." But because they were the army lads there, "I love Red Dwarf me." "Hey, great, mate." "Hey, good to meet you, Craig." "Hey up!" They were all coming in their Land Rovers and their armoured cars and they brought with them something like 250 yards of C4 ribbon, which is the stuff that you wrap around a bridge, tie it off, put a charge through it and it blows bridges up. The army said, "You mustn't tell the neighbours." And the production team said, "Well, why?" And they said, "Because if you tell them you're doing an explosion, "we'll have to tell them every time we do an explosion "and the deal is we just don't tell them." That explosion, you know, was just unbelievable. Five, four, three, two... This thing happened and we were right at the other side of the lake and you felt the shockwave hit you, it was colossal. And I think somebody, I can't remember, maybe Danny, he yelped like a girl. (SCREAMING) Yes! I was watching in the little hut next door to the explosion which the Radio Times photographer had his lens pressed right up against the glass so he could get a great shot. The blast was so big it pushed the shed back a couple of inches and I think the Radio Times photographer got a shot of his foot, the ceiling and his own face going... I don't think people had impressed on the neighbours how loud it was gonna be. And apparently they did phone the police and go, "What the hell is going on?" But they weren't that close. We're not talking a house... It was like, 500 yards away through the woods. All the windows got blown in. I think there are still some issues about that. So it was a loud explosion. Craig thought it wasn't that big. I mean, he'd seen bigger on the streets of Liverpool! Bits of gazebo fly into gardens, through windows, on people sunbathing, who, for some reason, got pissed off. And ran out of their houses and chased Cliff Pinnock, who had organised it all, down the road, I think. EPIDEME: David, come on. You've got a virus. It's fatal, it happens. Doesn't mean we can't be friends. Don't touch that dial! The basic idea of the talking virus was an old monologue idea. I came from writing the Jasper Carrott shows and there was a monologue he wanted to write about illness. So I just came with the idea, "What if an illness could speak? What would it say?" And it would say, "I'm just doing my job. I mean you no harm. "My job is to kill you and your job is to try and fight me." And so I thought that would be a good unusual villain. I think there was a discussion we had at one stage about David Cronenberg, who admired viruses. He said that viruses are to be admired because they're so tenacious and they're so... They preserve themselves. It's a really dark idea. And that darkness, I think, is there in the episode. And I think, in a way, the darkness inhibits some of the laughs because there is something really, really yucky about this talking virus being in his body and he's about to die and they have to amputate things in order to... There's no way to write that as kind of a... It's not Terry and June, is it, really? BENNETT: Funnily enough, that was again at Farnborough. They had a lot of areas, engineering areas, that were completely out of use and that meant we could go in and actually create what we wanted to do. And Mel did a fantastic job making it look completely snowbound, which, I mean, it really did look freezing cold. A myriad of ladders, tunnels, pipes... which you bang your head on. which we all did, I wasn't the only one. Everybody that day banged their head on something. It was designed as a head-banging area, I think. I sometimes stop on holiday and look at those and go, "Good location." Because I'm a bit sad. Hey, guys, check this out! There's a woman in there! BENNETT: when they actually bring that back to the studio and open it up, we actually had to do it in the studio, it was a fibreglass case that had been made by special effects, and they wanted somebody to be inside it. Unfortunately...we asked our runner to do it. And she very willingly obliged. The poor girl got shut in there while they did their lines and fluffed their lines and redid their lines. And when we opened it, the poor girl could hardly breathe. And a great big "Hi" to all of you out there in flesh-and-blood land/ And tonight, Dave Lister, assisting vending machine sub-operative and spice food connoisseur, this is your death. A lot of the time you think, when you hear voiceovers, that, you know, it's a seven-foot, black ex-American footballer. It's actually Gary Martin. An awfully nice, white gentleman from the country. I've been doing cartoons and films for years and years. I've voiced over 2,500 cartoons. I do things like Dennis the Menace. This guy's like this, he talks like this. (VERY DEEP VOICE) The monster was here like this. (AS SEAN CONNERY) There are two words you need to know to be able to do Sean Connery's voice... (COCKNEY) All right, darlin'. Did you spill my pint? ...and they are "sweaty bollocks". Hey, I'm the Sugar Puff Daddy! (AS MICHAEL CAINE) You always put the full stop in the wrong place. Yeah! Feel good! Huh! (AS MICHAEL CAINE) And, suddenly, you will shout for no reason whatsoever, girl. Oh, I'm out of here! Where's my agent? And I think sometimes as a voice guy, yes, you need to be subtle, but you must choose danger sometimes and, hopefully, with Epideme, I chose a bit of danger. To have him actually be there to perform live helped a lot. I was in one of the corridors on the Red Dwarf set, with a microphone, a monitor. I think I had a pair of headphones on so I could hear what they were saying. I could see what they were doing, but they really hadn't... They didn't know what I was going to do. So, I probably didn't even need a microphone 'cause half the time I was so loud they could hear me. He could speak so fast. And he was so confident. It was just... I love that, he was... I'd always blow it after he'd done his lines if I had one after him because I'd be just watching him going, "Brilliant. Oh, sorry, me." We just used to sit there, well I did, going, "That was really good. "Can you do the other one?" In the first draft, he was very kind of traditional, sort of Alan Rickmanesque, kind of pompous, kind of slightly pompous villain with witty one-liners and stuff like that. At one point there was even talk of getting Patrick Stewart in to do the voice 'cause, as you know, Patrick Stewart's a fan of the series. "Oh, let's get Patrick Stewart. He's got a good voice." And then, I think Doug and Ed decided to, because the rest of the episode was so dark, that it would be better to make it more overtly comic, the character of Epideme, because what he was doing was so awful that he should have a more... And so we came up with the idea of making him like a game show host. I wanted the character to be in your face, no-holds-barred, you know, hit the ground running. All those clichés that... They didn't give him chance to breathe. -Ask me a hard one. -A hard one? EPIDEME: (SCREAMING) A hard one! I also wanted that kind of The Exorcist kind of feel, that kind of Linda Blair. So you have all of these other characters coming in, talking like this... (IN GRUFF VOICE) "Yes, goodbye." This kind of voice. How does he do it? How does he get it down there? "The Leviathan." The Leviathan! And conceptually, it is a good idea. It's got one huge flaw, which I think Ed knew immediately. And the huge flaw is that it's very static, it's kind of radio. Because you've got a twirly thing, which is meant to be a villain... It's a bit like Lord of the Rings, you know. You've got a giant eye and that's your villain. Whereas at least in Lord of the Rings, you've got Christopher Lee and the Ores as well, sort of doing the villainy. And I think it was Ed who came up with the idea of extending the zombie thing so that there was some action at the start of the episode. I've always wanted to shoot a zombie film. I like shots of grizzly feet landing and splatting around all over the place and climbing up inside his bed... They always did that to me. It's like, "How can we make Craig sick today?" "Hey Craig, you got a bed scene!" "Great, great!" "But she's dead." Well, if they'd explained to me that they were gonna cover my face in Copidex, I probably would've run a mile. When you spend all that money on, you know, Clarins and Clinique creams for your face and then somebody slaps Copidex on it, it's kind of... You know, that's a bit disconcerting. Craig was kissing the zombie, and he did a bit, it was in rehearsal, and they were on the floor, kissing away, and he went, "Hey guys, guys, look at this." And he pulled her teeth out with his teeth and spat them out. It's not very often that I actually can't speak 'cause I'm laughing so much. And when he did that, I just couldn't breathe. He also did it in the show, but it was never as funny as the moment he first did it because I had no idea he was going to do that. Ah! Ow! Jesus! It's all right, I'm only acting. I'm quite a sturdy girl and, of course, we all know that the sets are quite unsturdy, aren't they? So I kind of felt I was gonna go through the back wall every time. So we had to do that take a few times. Aw, come on, rumpy-pumpy, Kris. I did the springs. Not only am I snogging a dead girl, then I get beaten up by a right looker. I mean, what are you trying to say to me? There was no need for rehearsals, I knew what I was doing. I gave it my everything. At the time my hair was as long as it could... It was down to my bottom. And it was all back-combed and I actually couldn't... The make-up lady couldn't get it out of my hair after the filming and she had to actually get in the shower with me, which is a little disconcerting and quite cramped. Can I have some details? Something a little bit more inspiring than, "Can I hack off your limb?" Doug said, in the weird arcane continuity of the Red Dwarf universe, there was a thing where Lister was meant to lose his arm. So we thought, "This is great. This ties in with established continuity." So they chop Lister's arm off. It's not enough. It's a big sequence and everything's being triggered, live. Kryten's using a hand prop with a light in it that needs to tie up with a practical pyro effect on a fake arm that has to be chopped into segments. I almost love making an audience go, "Eew!" more than making them laugh. It's just great to hear a whole room of people go, "Eew!" And that's what they did when Lister chopped off his arm. Yeah, I got my arm sawed off. Snogged a dead girl, got punched in the face by a looker. Yeah, just an average day at the office for me that. Leave it to me, sir. I know how to make contact. Can you hear me, you pesky little critters? We want our ship back and we want a new arm for Mr Lister. Are you receiving me? This was James Hendrie's episode. And James Hendrie had seen... There was a really good Horizon documentary back just before we were writing about nanobots. They were just becoming big in sci-fi at the time, nanobots, and James had done something unheard of to me, research! He'd actually got a transcript of this Horizon programme and it was really fascinating. The idea that tiny little robots could go around and rebuild Red Dwarf, rebuild arms, make a planet, was just... I thought, "What the heck? Somebody's making this all up." I think the original storyline was, the nanobots wreak havoc on Starbug. By the time it got near the end of the series and we decided to make it the final episode, I think he wasn't available to do the rewrite and the story had to change a lot in order to incorporate the rebuilding of Lister's arm and to incorporate the rebuilding of Red Dwarf as well. So, I did a pass on it, Doug did a pass on it and if you'd been around, you probably would have done a pass on it. -That's right. Pick up the ball. -Hand, pick up the ball. -Hand, pick up the ball. -That's right. Now keep going, sir. Pick up the ball! To be honest with you, it's down to Craig and Robert. You can rehearse it and rehearse it but you're gonna go, "OK, it's down to you." Yeah, sorry. Is that it? Is that the best it works? In other words, if I'm ever gonna pick up a ball... MAN: "If I ever wanna." CHARLES: If I ever wanna pick up a ball... In other words, if I ever wanna pick up a ball, I'm gonna have to take the morning off. And it's him screaming hysterically and Craig just waiting for his moment and just clouting him. Which I think he did actually, whack me a couple of times. Just set yourself up now, Robert, for me a minute and just... -I'm not gonna be in the shot. -Ah, okay. I could take it. I do all me own stunts. It was also one of those sequences we did do in one go. My experience was that we started out with this wonderful experience where you only have to learn a few lines, you do a little bit... But by the end, you really wanted to get your teeth into it and do a scene. We knew that there needed to be this red, huge planet with electrical storms and dust storms raging around it. But the planet itself was the snow planet redressed. And we were letting off small pyrotechnic charges which were meant to be the impact points of lightning. And it caused us... one slight hiccup when shooting it in that... traditionally, we have done the jets out of the base of the Starbug with Freon. And the way that this has been achieved is that the Starbug is held, two bottles of airbrush propellant, and just before a take, you turn on the nozzles, the cans are inverted, and you get these jets of white vapour from the nozzles below the Starbug. As far as we've known, airbrush propellant had always been Freon, which is an inert gas. It's not flammable, it doesn't do anything. Of course, it's a CFC so it was banned. And it had been replaced with butane. We knew this, but it hadn't registered. So we crammed the bug with airbrush propellant, turned on the jets and then set the pyros off, which ignited the butane and instead of four lovely white streams of vapour out of the bottom of the Starbug, we had four gouts of flame out of the bottom of the Starbug. I thought that looked very dramatic and, suddenly, everything got very hot. The bug gets swung back on to set, drops on to its back, still on fire, in we go with the fire extinguishers. And I'd lost all the hairs on my arms and a fair bit off my head. But I actually needed a haircut at the time so it wasn't too bad. All right, dudes. I think what started my return, my eventual return to Red Dwarf, was a convention in 1993 that I attended as a sort of reporter for Radio 5. I interviewed Rob and Doug and, you know, we had a good laugh and I think that was the beginning of me coming back there. Thrilled that he was back and we had suddenly, you know, a world class moaner in our midst. Something we missed. when I first started doing Red Dwarf Norman was the only person I knew. And, so I thought, "I'm doing that series with Norman in it!" Of course, he wasn't in it. It was like the end of the series and there's just this middle of a big studio and doing these lines and you just come back, you're a stranger. I felt, "I'm just a stranger. I'm gate-crashing the party here." He's back. Kicking bottom or what? It was funny going back and being Holly again because it was a long time since I'd done it. I'm being serious now. It was a long time. He's just a funny man and a great presence. And he moans a lot but he's generally got a point when he moans. Terry Fisher, I think he came from Big Bodies Monthly or something. Yeah, he had a great body, didn't he? I mean, you just couldn't help but stare and blush. Yeah. God, I've just got a vision of him again. And action. He was absolutely extraordinary because he wasn't that tall, but he was just huge. I mean, his upper arms were the size of... There's no part of my body big enough. You know these guys who go down the gym and they work out and they pump iron, you can't pump your head. So they get these massive bodies, don't they, with tiny little heads on top. I remember he came around the back and just lots of his veins stood out and then, I mean... I mean... It looked like rubber. It didn't look like a real body at all. And, you know, bless him, he had a great sense of humour and he was quite happy for people to point at him. You couldn't pinch his skin. I had a go. I wanted to have a go. There was no loose bits on him anywhere. You know, like here. Anybody's got a bit of wobble somewhere. There was nothing. You'd go like that and it was like doing it on marble. It was like, "Think I can get a little bit somewhere." Robert touched him? I didn't touch him! I didn't know we were allowed to! My God. No, it was phenomenal. Disappointingly, at the end, I didn't quite get that right, his head. If you look, folks, carefully, it's slightly off to one side to the body where I've joined the two together. Should've shot his head on blue screen and then manipulated the background and then be able to make a perfect match, but I did it on a split-screen. My fault, sorry. I want a poster of that. That's the after. I'm still at the before stage. (RED DWARF THEME SONG)
