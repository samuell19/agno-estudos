Oh, and Peter brought me flowers. No, I'm so sorry. I... [SIGHS] spilled water on your table and your... adult magazines and... Oh. I'm really sorry. I wasn't looking where... I just...

I mean, sure. I'll just... Kick your shoes off. Ah, that's okay. Really. [SIGHS] [BREATHES HEAVILY] [GASPS] Oh, okay, that's much better, thank you. It's a really nice place that you have here. Why don't you come sit down a relax a bit. Sure. Relax. Don't be so tensed. Yeah. I'm... I'm fine, really. You're a virgin. What? This is your first time? No. Yeah. Yeah, This is my first time. I'm sorry, I feel like an idiot. Relax. I'll take it really slowly. I promise. Just a couple of things before we get started. I don't do greek. I don't kiss on the mouth. And you wear condom at all times. Other than that, We can pretty much do whatever you want, sweetie. So, how about you and I, just head to the bedroom. That's okay, I'm... If you wouldn't mind. If it's not too much trouble, I just wondered whether we could may be just talk for a while, first. Sure. You wanna talk dirty. Sorry. No, no, no, I... So we could talk about normal stuff, first. Peter, it's fine. I mean, like sports It's not a big deal. Or politics. Peter. Um... Anything, we can talk about the weather all I care. It's just that I... Peter. My name is not really, Peter. I'm sorry. It's just that I didn't even know if I was really gonna come here. When you asked for my name on the phone, I just... My name is Thomas. Thomas. Thomas. I... I don't actually wanna have sex, okay. You don't wanna have sex? No. No, I mean I wanna have sex one day, you know, just not here, now with you. I mean you are gorgeous, okay. If I was gonna have sex with a prostitute you'd absolutely be the type... I am an idiot. I'm sorry. I just... I just thought I could come here to a place like this... To somebody like you to ask a few questions, just to... To learn about sex, and love, and everything. You know, but... mainly... Sex. So, you don't wanna fuck me. No. You just wanna talk about fucking? Yes. May be if it's not too much trouble. We might not use that particular word. Which word? Um... Fucking. Okay, so what would you like to call it then? Um... I don't know, we could may be call it... Just don't say making love. No, no, no, I... I'm just joking with you, Thomas. How about screwing? Is screwing okay? Screwing is great. I love screwing, yeah. I must sound really weird. No, not at all. [SIGHS] So, it's just not intercourse or no sex at all? What do you mean? Oh, there's always oral sex or I could give you a hand job. So, do you rent this place or do you own it? I own it. Wow! You must be doing pretty well. Do you want to tour? Yes. That'll be great. Yeah, lets do it. Okay. Ah... So this is the lounge. Lounge, got it. I'm sure you get it by now. Right, got it. It's alright. There's not gonna be a test or anything at the end. I promise. That's a pity. I'm really good at tests. Hey, Thomas. I'll be yours for the next hour and a half. Seriously, you can stop trying to impress me. No, no, I'm not trying to impress... So this is the balcony. You're quick. It's a great view. Second only to the view from in here. I don't know, I think the view from the balcony is better. I wasn't talking about that view. What do you think? Yeah, it's definitely better than the balcony. Jeez, you're ice cold. Won't warm me up? Seriously, aren't you cold? No. You got goosebumps. That's for you, stud. You sure you're not cold. I'm freezing. Why don't you put something on then. Men don't pay to see me in track suits. I think you can put it off. Hey, you can wear my jacket if you want to. No. No, no, no, it's okay. I've got something else. You sure you don't mind? No. Not at all. You wanna watch? More than you could possibly know. Okay, then I'll just be a sec. I'll just, eh... stay down here and stew in the awkwardness of the situation. You're funny. Ah, yeah. I'm better when I'm not face to face. Why is that? Ah, I don't know, my... My work's like a lot over the phone. What do you do? Sorry? What kind of work do you do? Hmm, I'm in insurance. It's short term, long term... It's so pretty boring. Really I've... Just always been good with people that are like accident prone, you know. Really? I'd never say. Yeah, it's true. Yeah. I don't know if you ever had to renew your driver's license. Ah, yeah. Couple of years ago, when we all had to. Yeah, if you can imagine an office like that on tranquilizers. It's pretty much where I work. [LAUGHS] Is it that bad? Yeah. Yeah, it's just an office full of men. Men on the phone. No woman. I mean the cleaning ladies are... a lady. But I don't think she really likes me. Everybody else kinda likes me though. Popular. You know, I might even go as far. Same kind of a... Like a ladies man. [GASPS] Looks hotter. Warmer, warmer. Are you feeling warmer. Much. Normally I generate body heat in more creative ways. Oh. Like how? Ah, so that's how you get over. No, no, no. No, I... Relax Thomas. I'm not gonna judge you. Sorry. And no more apologies. So, what were we talking about? Ah, sex. Right. Sex. So, I assume you sort off with the basics. Yeah. You know, birds and the bees. Yeah. Of course. And what else? And nothing else. [GULPS] You're joking right. Nope. Wait. So, you're... You're like "Virgin" virgin. Is there another type? No, no, no... It's just, When you said you were virgin earlier. I thought you were talking about this being your first time with a working girl. Ah... Then I guess, I'm a virgin squared. Wow! That's... That's pretty impressive. That why I do it. This is just how I get all the chicks. How old did you say you were, again? Ah, 25. So this is the other balcony. Look, I'm sorry. It's just... kinda weird. You know, we can just talk about normal stuff first. You know. Sex is perfectly normal? I know. I know, it's just... It's just like slowly ease into the sex talk. Like... Is Monique, your real name? It's not a big deal. If we're not gonna have sex, you could tell me, right? Why do you wanna know? It's like a step towards a normal conversation. What's the difference? Exactly, what's the difference? Come on. Monica. My real name is Monica. Monica. Thanks. Do you like, have a boyfriend? See you know, that's private. More private than oral sex and hand jobs? Yeah, that's just personal. Wait, there's this personal and then there's private. Yeah. What would private be? You couldn't afford it. I actually make a lot of money. Private's the boring stuff. You know like... Fund repayments, family things. But... Personal... Well... Personal involves all sorts of delightful activities. Sure. But they're not real. What? Wow! This doesn't feel, real? Ah, no. It feels pretty realistic. So how did you get into all of this? I just love sex, baby. All the time. Do you ever tell the truth? It is the truth. Now, how about we get down to business. [GASPING] Ah, does your family know? Private. I just... I just mean you don't... You don't tell anyone? Will you tell everybody you came here tonight? No. I guess not. May be if my conscious gets the better of me. 'Cause your conscious get the better of you a lot. How could you tell? Well... You're 25 years old. Good looking. You're a virgin. Came here to learn about sex. But you can't seem to talk about it. Are you like very religious? Hmm... No. Do you go to church and stuff? Yeah. How long? It's far back as I can remember. So you're like really religious. No, I wouldn't say religious. But... I guess, yeah. So you're just like Jesus, visiting the prostitute. Not exactly. How religious? I don't know. Not very, if you're with prostitute, eh? I guess not. It's not like we're doing anything. So... No. But... I thought the whole bible thing was... If you look at a girl, you just think about having sex with her. It's like you've actually done it. Ah-ha. So? Have you had sex with me, I think. May be. May be. What's that suppose to mean? Like five or six times already. [GASPS] You're a horny little bugger. Yes. No, I just trying to make a joke. Relax, Thomas. [SIGHS] Do you ever go to church? You say it like you've already decided the answer. No, no, no, I just... It's just that I grew up in the church, you know. What? That makes you the expert on who goes to church? Yeah, I guess. Nice. No, I... I'm not trying to insult you. My dad is the pastor of this small conservative church. And you know, all my memories are out of these crusty old people used to shout at me for stealing communion. Then used to sing Amen very loudly after each hymn. So? So it's just difficult to imagine you in that environment. Oh, well. I've been a couple of times. Christmas, Easter... Really? I never did go to a church where they're sayingAmen, after every hymn. So... I don't think our paths crossed. Yeah, I doubt it. My church has like 300 people. So everyone knows everyone else's business. And besides, you probably recognize me if you been there. I sing in the choir. Really? You're a choir boy, huh? That's kinda sexy. Yeah, I preferred the choir man. It's not like I wear a frock or anything. Still, it's kinda kinky. Amen! I used to love those old hymns. Ah, it's all we ever sing. Nothing new, nothing contemporary. Sing me one. No. Come on, choir man. We're not gonna screw, or even talk about screwing. And the least you can do is entertain me with a hymn. [LAUGHS] That's not gonna happen. I could do something for you in return. Tempting. Something that's not intercourse. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'll sing for you. If you... Tell me how you got into this. [LAUGHS] You're just not gonna give up. ♪ It is well It is well ♪ With my soul With my soul ♪ It is well It is well ♪ Is my soul Ah, nice try. ♪ When peace like a river ♪ Attendeth my soul ♪ When sorrows like Sea below rolls ♪ Whatever my lot ♪ Thou has taught me to say ♪ It is well It is well ♪ With my soul So? My mommy used to sing that to me. And I forgot, of course. She had a terrible voice. I used to like pretend that I was asleep just to make her stop. That's funny. You still see her? No. No, I don't. And me neither. You don't see my mom any more. [LAUGHS] My mom died like three years ago. Long pathetic tragedy very boring, but yeah, I don't see her any more. You were kind of a mama's boy, eh? And I have two older sisters. Ah Ha, the truth comes up. Come on. How did you get into all of this? Do you want anything else to drink? I'll sing again and that's for a cause. I'm from Cape Town and that'll be surreal torture. Trust me. What's the big deal of trying to get to know me? Yeah. Come on, it's an easy question. Why did you do it? I just love sex, Thomas. Isn't everyone? Doesn't mean that we all become. You know. How did you get started? Was it the money? Come on, it's gonna be more to it than just that. I mean... Did you ever study anything? You're joking right? No, I'm serious. What did you dream on doing one day? Who says I didn't dream of doing this? Here, with you. I'm serious. I really wanna know. If all you wanted to do is talk, you could've chatted to your church buddies for free. Well... Uhm... The church just isn't the same since my mom died. It's just... It's just different. What about you? Tell me about your girlfriend. No. Come on, tell me about your girl. I... I don't have a girl friend. No? A guy like you? That's kinda hard to believe. It's just the way it is, you know. But you've had a girlfriend before. Yeah, of course. Recently? Kinda. When? Ah... I don't know. Like a week ago. Wait. So that's it? What? That's why you're really here? What? She wasn't giving you any sex. No. No, it's... It's not how it was. What was it like then? Yeah. Things didn't work out. You know. How long? It's about four years. Four years and no sex. No wonder things didn't workout. That's not how it was, okay. It should have been a lot of touching, huh? No. She must've been pretty frigid. No. No. She wasn't for... 'Cause I'm telling you, four years is a lot of investment to make for no sex. How would you know? You're right. I should be showing you, what I do know. [SIGHS] Just leave it, please. Come on, I know there is big bad boy somewhere inside. I told you. Please baby, I'm just dying for a good screw. Look! I know, you don't actually wanna have sex with me. Okay. I mean, this whole pathetic charade is a stupid joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But like... Won't you get tired of all this fake stuff. I mean, ever since I came in here, it's been a big act. So? So it's not fair. What do you mean? I'm me, I'm being me you know. You just giving me nothing in return. Oh, you're just being you aren't you, Peter? Yeah. Okay, sure. I'm sorry 'bout that but I came clean. I know baby... Please. Don't call me, baby. Can we just chat. Let's just chat like... Just like... Two normal people. Two normal adults. Without all this crap, please. I don't do that. Why not? Because I don't know you. But you would've had sex with me. That's my job. And that's easier than a honest conversation. Yes. How? Because that's just my body, okay. Look, sweetie. I'm sorry. But I really think you should rather leave. Come on. I mean what? Is it too much to ask? You know. From the woman's legs go all the way down to the floor. Don't talk to me like that. Like you've been talking down to me ever since I came in here. That's not fair. I'm like the cute religious virgin freak who doesn't have... Yes, you're a freak and I'm not your therapist. I don't want therapy! [SIGHS] I just need somebody to talk to, please. Okay, fine. You wanna talk. Let's talk. You're pretty stupid for a smart guy. You think this is it. Things happen here and then you leave and that's it. This isn't some little bubble, you know. Leave here and go home to your family and friends and tonight still happened. If your girlfriend finds out. That's damn real to her. She wasn't even here. But you can believe me, it's fucking real to her. That's the reality, Thomas. Yes, I know. I'm not denying that. Yes, you are. You wanna have this real time here. Really get to know me. Meet someone and share something special. Something intimate. How, even more intimate than sex? And then... One day I'm gonna walk by you in a shopping center. And you'll be there with your pretty innocent girlfriend. And our eyes will meet. And I'll just keep walking by, 'cause I'm a professional. And that'll be more than fine with you. You'll drop your eyes. Grip your girl's hands a little tighter. And you know why that's not okay with me? Because you'll know me. Not my body. Not what I look like when I'm naked or how I sound when I come. But me. You can't have that for a 1000 rand an hour. You're right. What? You're, you're totally right. I'm sorry. I've had sex before. With my ex-girlfriend. And it was terrible. Was she also a virgin? Yeah. She was. [SIGHS] It was so awkward. I was so nervous, man. But we were freaking horny and... The next thing, it was just happening. And I guess, I just thought that after all this time it would be like ecstasy, you know. But it wasn't? No. I was trying to be so cool, you know. So in control. I couldn't even get it in I was... find the... [SIGHS] And when I did. I'm like... Oh, man. I was just trying to hold myself up after my hands were still shaking. She's just like, "Slow it, please. Slow it." [SIGHS] All of a sudden things aren't so erotic any more. Couldn't even come. Just held it for a while, you don't know what to say. Have anything to say. Went to get a towel, "not white" she says. I'm looking at her and she's curled up on the bed and I look down on my... It was covered in... [BREATHES HEAVILY] Man. She's just... She's just cute. It was real life, Thomas. It was a little too real. I'm telling you, man. Those Hollywood directors should be shot. It was nothing. And it was like nothing like the movies. I'm not naive, okay. Okay, I'm a little naive. But obviously, I know like what we see it's... It's an exaggeration. Give me a freaking break. It's like... What? Just throw her up against the wall and plunge in. You know, there's no lubrication or fondling. No, no, no. He uses sloppy kisses and wash her face. Sharon Stone, squealing like a hamster, you know. There is no, "Oh sorry, I'll go to the toilet quick", Or what's this sticky mess. No, you know what. I will tell you, what. Let's just have multiple orgasms, you know. Like in perfect synchronization on a kitchen sink, no less. [SIGHS] You think she sounded like a hamster? Shows you what I know about sex. [SIGHS] Okay. So, you wanna know about great sex? And forget all that stuff, Thomas. Everything you've seen, were imagined. It's just not like that. It's not about... orgasms, coming, and all that stuff you said. Great sex is about making yourself the most vulnerable that you've ever been. And trusting someone with that vulnerability. [CLANGS] We were. I mean, I can't imagine... No, you weren't. It's not about being physically naked, it's that your feelings are not there. What do you mean? Did you tell that you were nervous? You thought you might mess it up. Because that's being vulnerable to someone, Thomas. When you get that tried. Doesn't matter if it's pretty or not. Because it's not just about you any more. It's about both of you. Being honest with each other. That's it. That's the secret to great sex? Hey, you got it from the source. Like you don't ever get to have that. More coffee? Yeah, I just thought it might have something to do with the squatting crane or the sideways... Side what? You know, kamasutra stuff. Yeah, personally I'd advice against anything that refers to form animals and the title. Thanks. Well, I should... Yeah. So, what are you gonna say to her? Who? Your girlfriend. Actually, she was more like my fiancee. That's quite a big difference, you know. Yeah, I know. We kinda had for four years, so... Everyone. I mean, everyone thought we gonna get married. It is a... Just a lot. You know, kind of went without saying that we weren't gonna have sex till we're married. I mean, that's just the way it is you know. Sex is for marriage. Getting married so that you can have sex is like buying an airplane, so that you can eat the peanuts. Yeah, I guess. It was more than that you know, we were in love and... In the beginning it was fine. We knew what we wanted in our... You know, our focus was on honoring each other. I don't know, as we were closer to being married, we just let things go little further every time. I didn't tell anyone how I was feeling. I mean, what? Gonna talk to God about how I wanna do my girlfriend. I dealt with it for 25 years you know, so I'll be fine. It's just like, it's consumed me. I felt so guilty all the time. We kept keep telling ourselves that we're gonna be, okay. And one day it just happened. How long ago was this? It's like two weeks ago. Wait. So you went out for four years. Finally, had sex once and then things just didn't workout. Yeah. Wow! I was just bad for a man. Oh, you were bad for then, not before. Yeah, before, after... just... It wasn't how it wanted things to be. What? Nothing. What? What is it? I assume you can just knock yourself out. Good night. Wait a minute. What's going on? Moni... Monica, don't touch me, okay. I can't even touch you, I mean little bunch of filthy pigs touch you whole day long... Yeah, well these are honest about who they are, when they come in here. Excuse me. You want some honesty? Okay, fine. You're a fucking bastard. What? You screw your girlfriend because you're both horny as hell and maybe it's a little bit awkward and "Oh, she doesn't look like every girl in a porno mag" that you never looked at. It's all over before it's even started. And then... Then the guilt sinks in. And suddenly she becomes this... living, breathing monument to your hypocrisy. You figured, she deserves better than you And really you just don't wanna be around her. You fucked her. The only way you can get over your own guilt is by not having to see her any more. Am I right. I'm right, you know, I am, you prick. I can't believe it. You just said that you wouldn't judge me For what? Because I'm a whore. No. Thomas, if you want somebody to tell you it's okay. Go to your priest. You think I can go to my pastor, my dad? Oh, what the hell type of church are you playing with? You can't even tell the people closest o you about something like this. You're right. Me and my life is just as much a lie as yours. Selling these rubbish fantasies for every guy that comes in here. Making him feel like he's the only guy in the world that you ever made love to, baby. Screwing guys that you know have wives, you know have families. They come to me. They know what they get. It's crap, your whole life is a big fat lie. What you think this is just gonna go one day, huh? What you're gonna meet some prince charming he's gonna be so fine with the fact that you screwed hundreds of guys. You know what? One day you'll be walking through a shopping center, men will be staring at you and your husband will wonder, if you ever did that guy. And, so what? I'll see you. We'll both know... we did it together. You'll know, that it was the monster fuck of your life. And you'll compare everything to this. To this moment now. Best sex you ever had with the worst girl you ever knew. It's what you wanted since you came in here. Is it what you want? Oh, it's what you want. I know you do. You're right. I do wanna fuck you. [UNZIPS] [GASPS] Why are you stopping? You're shaking. Here, I'm sorry. [FOOTSTEPS FADING] Is that it? I'm sorry. Just like that, you're just gonna leave? Yeah, I'm sorry. This whole thing was a mistake. Money. Yeah. It started because of the money. My mom made me do ballet, growing up. Used to love to dance. I had two months rent to pay, my varsity fees was due in a week and I saw this ad. I wasn't forced into it. I knew what I was doing then. I knew exactly what I was doing. The very first time I walked into the parking lot with one of the guys for the extra cash. Why you telling me this? Because, Thomas, you think, you understand me. You think, you understand what just happened here. But all you've done is talking. Really you haven't heard anything. You know, they say, you don't pay a hooker to do what she does. You pay to leave when she's done. That's exactly what you did here, tonight. Only difference is you're pretending you haven't. Like you pretend that you just got into this for the cash. What? You want me to make up some melodramatic story about how I grew up? What it was that turned me into a whore? Because there has to be a reason, right? In your perfect little world there has to be a reason. Can't just be that, this is what I chose. I must've been a real slut in high school, huh? Someone, al the boys knew was a surest thing. Right? [ELEVATOR BELL DINGING] Oh, it didn't start there, did it? Before that. Way back, I must've been raped. Abused. My dad, he did this to me, didn't he? That's why I turned out like this. Isn't it, Thomas? [ELEVATOR BELL DINGING] Amazing. So, suppose all the other stuff about... your dad and growing up. That was just a lie too. Right, Cristy? Right, Thomas. You're right. Well done. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGING] What do you mean, "Well done"? You been just lying to me the whole time. Yeah, that's it. You solved me. Good job, Thomas. It's all a lie. So I'll just keep living mine and you can keep living yours. Hey, wait. I'm not lying. May be I'm a little bit, but not on purpose. Oh, I see. Your lies are better than mine. Well, yeah. I thought you were living. No, I still have 27 minutes left. You're right, sweetie. You do have 27 minutes... Please, come on. Please. Fine. No, it's just... You're not understanding, Okay. It's like... Just wait. I've never done this before. You think I didn't peg you from the minute you walked in here. What do you mean? You're wireless guys. Come to a club and say, you don't want a private dance. Still have like a 1000 rand cash in your jacket's pocket, just in case. Yeah. You're number one fear is that you think, you'll be caught cheating, or that you contract some disease from me. No. The thing you're most worried about? Is that, I might think you're just like every other... What did you call them? Filthy pigs. Who comes through here everyday. You'll do anything to convince a whore. That you're actually a nice guy. Well, I'll have to break it to you, Thomas. That you're not a nice guy. [FLUSHING] There's no such thing. Yeah, I know. Don't bullshit me. If I hadn't stopped earlier, You would have loved to fuck me. Hear moan and scream, even if I was faking it. You would. You would. Come on, admit it. Yes. And no. What do you mean yes and no. Yes, sure. Okay, there's a part of me that wants that. There's another part that does wanna do the right thing. You are schitzo. No, I'm not. Come on, like you don't feel like there is... well, You don't do what you're doing, you justify it. But deep down you, there was another way. Another life. You're on, Thomas. I made piece with my life, a long time ago. This is it. I don't need anybody's pity. Definitely not yours. I don't believe you. You don't believe what? You don't long for that type of sex that you explained earlier. That type of intimacy. That deep down you're not hoping that one day it's gonna be... Fuck off, Thomas. This is what it is. You just said, there's gonna be times when sex is more than physical it's vulnerable, it's about sharing. Thomas, I told you what you wanted to hear. No you didn't. You paid me. So I made you feel better. No body lies that well. Well, I do. You meant it. You did. You did. No, Thomas. 'Cause you had it before. You know what it feels like. The type of honesty... Fuck you! Shut up. That type of love, that's what love is. You're so full of shit. No. I'm not trying to... Do you have any idea, how many men come in here? Tell me that they're having sex with me, because they love their wives. They're fucking me 'cause they love their wives too much to leave them for not satisfying them sexually. Love is just an excuse to do all sorts of horrible things to each other. No. What do you know about love? I know enough What do you know about love? What do you know? I know it's convenient for men like you. We had nothing. That Yakub spent more money than he did on me. My mom didn't know I was gone till I called her that Monday. She was furious with me. My dad, he was furious with my mom. We'd done it. We were in Jarlsberg, we were both studying. I was even getting some A's. What happened? We were just about making enough to get by, but then... Um... Yakub, failed his one semester, and we weren't gonna make rent that month. He said if I could support him while he studied, he'd do the same for me, once he started working. So? So, I could use some guys with one of the clubs and... I still loved to dance. Made you strip? He didn't make me do anything. I was in love, remember? When I brought home the first pay check, everything seemed, okay. Then? He started feeling guilty. Like it was his fault that I was stripping. He finished his studies and decided he wasn't in love with me any more. Told me that it was best for me. He also said that, Shantal, his study partner really understood him. If he stayed with me, it would just be unfaith to the guy who was really gonna make me happy one day. Wow. Load of crap. Yeah. You think that's what I'm doing? I think, that nothing men do, surprises me any more. Not up until you told me, you broke up with your fiancee for her sake. You were the first guy who surprised me in a really long time. I just want to get it right. Just want to get it right. Screwed it all up. No, Thomas. Your church has screwed you up. What? No sex before marriage. And there's no safety net, no support when you're with... It's not like that. Yeah, may be my church it's kind of it. It is supposed to be like that. What do you mean? I mean there's a difference between my church and my faith. Okay, faith is the ideal. How I'm supposed to be. And the church is just sometimes... the broken institution trying to maintain that ideal. Broken sounds like a massive understatement. I know. It's my dad, you know. Ever since my mom died it's like somebody broke the huge piece off of him. The best piece. It's like the peace that understood grace and forgiveness. Please, grace and forgiveness is like the furthest thing from religion. I know. I mean. You're right. Why do you think, I'm here and not in my church. You know. There are these things which are missing from religion. But religion is what kept me a virgin. May be it's kinda but... It's bigger than that, you know, it's faith. Which is the basis of all religion. The fact that I get to choose. It's an amazing combination of free will, and the fact that there is a greater plan for my life. Somebody big is in control, you know. All I've to do is ask, and I could be forgiven. So why don't you just ask? 'Cause I'm ashamed. Well, maybe it doesn't really work. Maybe it's all just idealistic bullshit. [SIGHS] No, it's real. I've seen it be real. In the last two weeks before my mom died, my dad realized that she wasn't gonna make it. He just stopped visiting her. Just like that. It was like he couldn't comprehend that his almighty God wasn't gonna save her. I hated him for that. I told my mom that I'm never gonna forgive him. And she says to me, "Don't you ever talk about the man I love, like that. "Who are you to hold two weeks against the man who's given us 30 years of his life." May be it's just not for you then. I mean, that dint mean you're right, you know. Love is just a selfish excuse to do whatever we want for ourselves. You have a better idea? Yeah, I mean the love that my mom had. Just like she was never thinking about herself. What do you mean? I mean, she just had the kind of love that focus on the good in us, in my dad. Everyday, I mean, even in hospital She's just like unrelenting on how she loved us. I'm really sorry. It's okay. No, I'm sorry about what I said to earlier that you'd never get out of this. I really do believe that one day there'll be a guy that'll take you as you are and put all this in the past and make a new start with you. The guy's who're coming here are not like that. Why do you think I never use my real name. Yeah, I guess. Thanks for your time. Cristy. Kareen. My name is Kareen. Thanks, Kareen. I should go. Listen. I really meant it. What? What I said to you out there. You know there could be this man... Um... Somebody that'll forget all of this and... I don't know someone you can trust with all your Vulnerabilities. Yeah, sure. No, I'm serious. So what about you? What about me? Could I trust you? What? Could you be that man? You're messing with me right? What if I was being serious? What if I ask you to take me with you, could you? It's no way that I could know that you're really being serious. I'd like to. Really I would. It's just with my fiancee... I was just joking with you, Thomas, Peter. I mean it's... It's just that you're really complicated. Look, don't be silly. I wasn't being serious. Look may be I can speak to the guys in HR, about getting you a PR job or something. Do you really think that I wanna leave this life of wealth and excitement for some boring HR job. Please, Thomas. Grow up already. Yeah, sorry. Remember, its... all just an act, baby. But you kissed me on the lips. Thomas, it's been an hour together you really think that I'm gonna change my whole life for you. I was just playing with you. Jeez, you really do live in your little dream world. Yeah, I guess. Thanks for your time. [DOOR OPENS] Okay, look. Nobody accept well, okay. I don't believe you. Thomas. You were telling the truth just now when you asked me to take you away... Thomas, what are you doing? You were, okay. Just tell me that. Because I just can't bear to leave it this way with all the ice tea we had and then... this bullshit at the end. Just tell me the truth. Thomas, you're very sweet and everything. No, no. Don't do that to me. Don't talk down to me like none of it happened, it did. I stood right there. I watched you say that, you wanted to get out of this. And I'm... I'm sorry okay. I'm sorry. I'm such a loser and I couldn't be there for you then. But I'm here now, and I don't even know what that really means. Look at me. Please look at me. I'm not saying that we'd be together. But as a friend I could really help you. Really I could. Thomas, we are from two different worlds... No, no, no, that's not what you said, okay. You said, to be that man. I'm trying. Okay, I just. I don't think I can live with myself, if all this was some sort of act. I have to know. You wanna get out of this? Do you want somebody to take you away from this, Kureen? What do you want me to say? The truth. Just the truth. I'm a girl, Thomas. Of course I wanna be rescued. It's every little girl's dream. A knight in shining armors... sweeping off my feet and taking me to safety. To a place where... you don't have to answer the phone in the middle of the night sounding sexy. A place with no uncomfortable underwear. Place where days aren't made out of one hour sessions. Sure. I want that. [SIGHS] Thank you. Oh, man. I thought I was going crazy. So, why didn't you say something to me when I flaked out earlier? Please, Thomas. I asked you for that but that was silly of me. No, it wasn't, okay. Listen, I know what I'm talk about, okay? May be it is something that I want deep down inside. Ah, I don't know. You just brought it out of me with all your stupid superman save the world heroics. But it's all just a fantasy, Thomas. No, it doesn't have to be... You're the one who keeps talking about honesty. Yes, I don't wanna be a hooker for the rest of my life. I want somebody to love me. But realistically, [SIGHS] you're a boy. You have a girlfriend who loves you, who you're gonna marry. You go to church. I mean we just... We're doomed to failure even as friends. Don't say that. You don't know that. I mean nobody does. That's what faith is, you know. It's the substance of things hoped for. The evidence of things not seen. Thomas, you're wonderful. No, no, no. No, really you are. Hang on, the point is like... Just because it doesn't seem like something couldn't workout. Doesn't mean that we should give-up on it. I'm just tired of trying to make it on my own, Kureen. And I don't want you to have too either. I'm touched you feel so strongly about this. I know what you're trying to do. You just listen to me, okay. What you have with your fiancee... I'm not talking about her. I'm talking about you. We can make plans to get... Well, you just shut up and listen to me, okay. Do you wanna do something for me. Yes, I really wanna help. Well, then go be that man for your girlfriend. Go back. Patch things up. Start over again. Get married. I know you wanna. When you've done that. Call me. Call me and tel me, I was wrong and it can actually work. Okay. And you? I've got a plan. This isn't gonna be me for the rest of my life. I'm gonna get out of it. Well, get out of it now then. Okay. Okay, don't worry. So I'm supposed to make everything, okay. And you just get to carry on. I don't wanna talk about this now. Why don't you give me a call next week and we can chat some more... I don't know if I'm able to come back here. Would you just relax we'll just chat again. Okay. Hey, may be we can meet for coffee somewhere. I have a coffee machine. Okay. It was great for me. How was it for you? It was good. [GROWLS] Bye, now. Bye. I'll wait for your call. Okay. Oh, I'm so sorry about the flowers. And the magazines are in the pillow. Yeah. Bye. Bye. [DOOR CLOSES] [DIALING] Hi, it's me. He just left. Jeez, five extra minutes. Will you just chill. Good. That's good. Bit of a talker, but cute. Easy one. No, no, no. He paid cash. Well, I think I hooked him for another appointment next week. Thanks. Wasn't that difficult. [LAUGHS] I know what you mean. Okay. Sure. Well, can I get it from for you tomorrow? If that's good with you. Okay. Sure, will do that then. Okay, sure. No, I think I'm done for the night. Well, tell him I'm away or something. I'm just gonna take a bath. Okay. Okay, bye.
