A SHOCHIKU PRODUCTION Mother! Mother! Mother! Where are you? Forgive me! He said I must abandon you. I don't know if he will make me happy. But I can't part with him now. Oichi, I'm a bad mother. Hate me! Mother! I'm so scared! Mother! It's dark! I can see nothing! This little girl, without knowing that her mother has left her... ...and that she is now blind... ...was weeping and trembling with fear in total darkness.

Catch him! Did you find him? No! He can't escape! He runs fast, but he's an old man. Don't lose him! Find him! Here he is! Stop! Don't make noise! Woman! She's blind! Woman, you'd better hand the old man over to us! You must! A large reward is offered for his head by the authorities. Did you hear? Give him to us or you'll be in trouble. I don't like this. I'm already in trouble. I can't overlook you hoodlums... ...trying to cruelly kill an old man. Old man, stand aside or you'll get hurt. This may be fate's decree. Thank you very much for saving me. We were fated to meet each other like this. They said a large reward was offered for your head. It's not true. An old man like me isn't worth a big sum. They took me for someone else. I will go now. Wait! I can smell something about you. Don't be nervous! I mean you smell because you haven't had a bath. Obun! Obun, come here! He was killed at a stroke. Here lies one more! That old man must... Obun! Obun! Shut up! Don't call me Obun! But, Obun, he's still breathing. Why didn't you say so first? Step aside! Who attacked you? That old man? No... Woman... When we cornered the old man... ...a blind woman... A blind woman? Damn! It must be Oichi. She's strong. Shut up! They call me "Top-Swinging Obun". I can't let her take the reward. What a beauty! A bath is a comfort when you travel. You go now. But I don't... You must bathe. You're so dirty. I don't want to travel with a smelly man. I hate a bath. Go and bathe! You must go! You saw it. You saw it, didn't you? What stupid things you say! I'm blind. I can see nothing at all. You have me. I'm sorry to act foolishly. Well, I'm glad when people take me for a woman with sight. Listen, Oichi. Why are you so kind to a man like me? How old are you? I'm 53 years old. He'd be your age, if he were alive. He was very kind. He raised a blind girl abandoned by her mother. Grandpa, did you see her? Yes. She must be pretty. At last Omitsu's gone. All my friends are married. Oichi. Grandpa. How was Omitsu? Every bride is the same. She wore a white headdress, riding a horse... Omitsu must be happy. When you wed, I'll have you wear a more beautiful dress. I don't want to marry. Why not? I'll find a very good man for you in the near future. Never mind. I'll stay with you. I want to live with you as long as I live, but... It's been a long time, Yasuke. Denzo! I searched for you. I want to talk to you. Don't worry. All right. Wait for me in the trees behind my house. Be sure to come. Who do you think I am? All right. Grandpa! Grandpa, what are you doing? I'm so afraid of that man. Oichi... Do you want to meet your mother? Your mother ran away with her man, leaving you behind. But later she was abandoned by him. Then she wandered about, carrying out an indecent trade. I heard from a traveler that she is now in Takasaki. Takasaki? The traveler saw her. Go to see her, if you want. Grandpa, where are you going? While alive, you are a nuisance to me. You well know... ...I will never tell on you. Do you still want to kill me? I trust no one. You've always been like that. You're always selfish and low. Kill him! Grandpa! Grandpa! Was that man's name Yasuke? What was he to you? He was unrelated. He didn't mix with the villagers. They said he was eccentric. But he was like a father to me. I didn't know he was... Old man. You knew Yasuke, didn't you? What happened? Shut up and stay away! They'll take you for a jail-breaker. Get away! Thank you very much. Only a women here! He said he'd go to Takasaki. TAKASAKI Boss! Did you catch Nihei? I'm sorry, but I lost him. You lost him? It seems he's coming here to Takasaki. Thank you for your troubles. Enjoy yourself with this. A blind woman? Yes. I saw the men killed by her... They wore ghastly cuts. They say she uses a red sword-cane. She is a very fast swordplayer. And she is very beautiful. Grandpa! Why did you die? Why did you die alone? I liked you, Grandpa. I liked you very much. I waited to stay with you long. You feel lonely, don't you? I'm lonely too. I'm alone, I'm lonely. Nobody will take care of me. I want to die too. Who killed you? Who on earth killed my Grandpa? Who killed my dearest Grandpa? Hey, woman! Hey! The voice! I know! It's the voice! You killed him! I know you did! You killed my Grandpa! She might know about us. I'll avenge the murder of my Grandpa! She is blind! Wait! I don't like it! I don't like what you're doing. Why are you going to kill this poor woman? You're a pack of beasts! Shut up! You foul samurai! You call me a foul samurai, huh? Your pose is strange. An occult art, eh? You're an expert. You're safe now. Are you hurt? You were in danger. Why are you crouching? Get up now! Get up! Nothing to worry now. Are you OK? I'll avenge my Grandpa's death! You're wrong! I'm not one of them. Stop it! She was like a mad woman. But in her desperate swinging of the sword... ...I saw unusual sharpness which might be a natural gifts. And I saw the loneliness of a woman ready to take on the whole world. Suddenly I felt like teaching her the art of fencing. It might be a whim. Or it might be destiny which had prearranged this for us two. Oichi, can you detect the enemies around you? Open your mind's eyes! And listen to the wind. Where the current divides, there's an enemy. Count then! One! Two! Three! Four! Kill them! You're slow! By the time you cut No.3, you'd have been killed by the last one. Ready? I'm going to throw these! Good! Good, Oichi! I'll do it silently. You greenhorn! Oichi made amazingly-rapid progress. I, a roving bouncer, had thrown away all hope. But I found life worth living at that time only. Oichi, you can hear the bell of course. Yes. Now don't be deceived by the tinkle of bells. Notice danger hidden in the sound. You did it! You did it, Oichi! Teacher! You did it! You did it! I'm so glad. There's nothing left I can teach you. The sword-cane is my present to you. Yasuke's sword is in it. Use it as a cane. Thank you very much. I'll keep this always. Don't draw it! Once you do, you can't lead a normal life. I'm an example of that. Teacher... Oichi, you'd better stop thinking of revenge. Be a normal woman. You'd better marry a man, huh? No man wants to marry a blind woman like me. Must be someone. You're blind, but you're pretty. Even I'd like to marry you. Do you really feel that? Yes. Did I ever tell you a lie? Please let me stay with you. I beg you! I beg you! I beg you! May I stay with you? I want to be with you. I'm so glad! I'll buy you some sake for the cane you gave me. I was not confident I could give Oichi a happy life. I left the inn without a word to her. You have a very good thing. Give it to me! Hey, give it to me! Oh, you're very pretty! A beautiful woman is the best drinking partner. Let's drink together! You bitch! Teacher! Oh, it's pitch-dark here. Oh! I thought nobody was here! You shocked me! Oh, I see. The dark doesn't bother the blind. Where's the samurai? His things are gone. I see. He has abandoned you. Pity! You're blind. He played with you. He was a bad man. My teacher isn't bad. Don't call me blind! What's wrong with it? Can't a blind woman fall in love with a man? Teacher! Teacher! Teacher! Welcome! Ohama, are you sure you can get Kyusaku's daughter? Leave it to me. A virgin for 50 ryo is a bargain. You're right. What's funny? You! That about me? You were abandoned by your man. If it weren't for me... ...you would've been a whore. I know. So I always feel grateful for you. I know you paid the land-tax and got medicine. That's your story. But business is business. I have your IOU. It says that you pay your debt, or your daughter comes to my house. So I lent the money to you. Right? Good! Good! Now I'm much relieved. Don't worry. It's my custom to take good care of girls who enter my house. And you'll enjoy the trade, once you become accustomed to it. Every girl does. You've agreed, now. When I come here tomorrow, don't make a fuss. Hello! What...? Please... please give this old man a cup of water. May I...? Are you leading a happy life? Oyone, let him help himself! Is your name Oyone? Nice name. Who's that woman? Is it about marriage? Then you must be happy. Oyone, don't talk to such a man! Thank you. Thank you very much. Oyone! Oyone! It's a nice name. Don't weep. You aren't a child. Hey, wait! Please wait! Wait! Oyone! Oyone, tell me what this is all about. I beg you. What is this? What do you have to do with this girl? Knowing my patron is Boss Masagoro, will you still meddle? Damn you! Let's go! Oyone! Oyone! Oyone, you are crying, aren't you? Thank you. Follow me! This is a new girl. Look after her. Don't just stand there! Greet them! Greet them! She seems gentle. That kind is stubborn. Don't put her to work yet. Lock her in the godown. Master, do you intend...? Of course not, you fool! The man from Edo... You think much of him. But what is he? He's here to buy cocoons. I asked him to stay at my house. He has a large sum. The old man acts strangely. Oh, does he? He may be the thief with a prize on his head. Is that "Monkey" Nihei? Yes. Tattooed? I don't know if... Oh, Mr. Ukita. Did I interrupt you? No, sir. We were just having a chat. Who is he? I am a wandering bouncer who likes sake. You're a very happy man. Drink a cup of sake. A cup of sake? I'd like to drink more. The more, the better. You're really happy. Good. Fill it up. I hear you've come from Edo. What is your business? Well, I do many things. Oh, you do many things, huh? Many things, huh? It's an old story. There're many poor girls who must sell themselves. But why are you so worried about the girl? You're almost a beggar. It was nearly 20 years ago. A man who seemed a criminal... ...passed this village carrying a small baby. He put the baby under the eaves of a farmhouse... ...at the edge of the village. He prayed for something. Then he left there, turning back several times. If Oyone's real father were here... ...he'd be eager to see her. But... ...if I were the man... ...I'd decide not to see her. Why? In any case... ...he's selfish to feel so after 20 years. Moreover, you say he's a criminal. Suppose he meets her. Her foster parents will be annoyed. If I were her father, I wouldn't see her. Well, Nihei, don't you think so? That's right. You're quite right. If I were her father, I wouldn't see her. Even if I were her father! But... If I were her father... ...I could never overlook her being sold to a brothel. I would do something. Surely I would! Old man, don't lose your temper. Don't lose your temper. Let's continue! Please bet! Please bet! Even! How we're ready! There! 4 and 3, odd! Box! Now we're ready! There! 2 and 6, even! Listen! That's "Top-Swinging Obun". She's very famous. Her figure is sexy and her face beautiful. Then she must be perfect. But Obun has a very foul tongue. Does she? Hello! Wait a minute! You're blind! Can't the blind enter here? Oichi! Let's proceed. There! 5 and 6, odd! I'll repay you. For what? Don't play innocent! We're ready! There! 5 and 3! It's even. Let's proceed! Odd! You're very lucky. Are you Boss here? Yes. I want to play with you alone. Any objection? Odd! Even! There! 3 and 6! It's odd! Wait! What? Let me examine that box. All right! I'll show you! Come on! I want you to examine them! I want to examine that dicebox. Loaded! They're fake! You must admit that I won. Cash them in! There're 140 chips. Hurry up! Catch her! She'd blind! Old Man! Wait! Damn you! You shamed us! You're Obun. Say what you want quickly. I'm in a hurry. They call me "Top-Swinging Obun". I must repay you for what you did. Yes. We'll reward you handsomely! Prepare yourself! You are impossible! Gotcha! Die! Damn you! I'll teach you a lesson next time! Oichi! Teacher! I've become a woman who doesn't trouble after she kills a man. You've changed. I heard you had a mother who left you when you were small. Did you find her? I don't think of that low woman as my mother! I don't want to see her. Please don't call out. Do you know Oyone? She was brought here today. You know her? Good! Tell me where she is now. Where's Oyone? She's in the godown in the back. In a godown? My Oyone? Oyone! Oyone! Who is it? I've been waiting. Denzo! I see. You killed Yasuke, didn't you? Why? Because only Yasuke and you know about me? I've looked for you. Now I'll kill you. Wait, Denzo! There's something I must do. Wait till do it. Your daughter? I know about her. I knew you'd come to me if I held her. She was a nice girl. I made a woman of her. What? But she resisted so hard that I had to kill her. Oyone! Oyone! Poor girl! I'm sorry. I'm your father. I was a cruel father. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Forgive me, Oyone! Forgive me! Find her? Where has she gone? Here she is! Hire a masseur for 43 mon and feel relaxed. Damn masseur! You fool! What? A woman wants to see me? Good evening. You want to talk to me? Are you the landlady? Oh, you're blind. I don't need a masseuse. I'm not a masseuse. What? What are you going to do? Here are 70 gold pieces. Please count them? What is this? I want to redeem a girl named Oyone who was brought here today. Redeem Oyone? Kyusaku owed you 50 ryo. 20 ryo is the interest. You talk fancy. But you're still blind. You can't see the whole picture. Redeem her for 70 ryo, including with 20 ryo interest? Don't make me laugh! I bought Oyone for 50 ryo. When I polish her up and train her, I can sell her for 200 ryo. 70 ryo isn't enough. Leave, and don't come back! Madam, I was wrong. Please forgive me. You may be angered by a blind girl so forward. Forgive me please. I apologize. I can't. I beg you. I'll raise the rest of the money within 2 days. Please wait 2 days. I beg you. I beg you. Listen! It's strange. I could understand if you were her sister or a parent. What are you to her? If I tell you the reason, will you listen to me? No. I don't want to listen. Please listen. I'll be grateful if you do. There's a man who abandoned his baby some 20 years ago. He had a reason. He had no choice but to abandon his own child. As years passed, his longing for his child increased. Finally he broke jail to see his abandoned daughter. And he escaped from the prison island. He wanted to see her. Even if he can't talk to her, he just wanted to see her. He was a criminal. He couldn't identify himself. But he saw her and thought she was happy. He cried with joy. But unluckily... ...his daughter was to be sold for a debt. Now, Madam, you can understand the reason. Please imagine the pitiful feelings of the parent... ...who returned prepared for death. I beg you to grant my wish. Well... ...your story makes me sympathize with the man. I can understand how he feels about her. But the girl is destined... Madam! You may think I'm forward. But actually... ...I was abandoned by my mother when I was 7. Unlike Oyone's father... ...my mother completely forgot about me. There's no news of her. That's why I want to take care of Oyone's father. Madam, please feel pity for him. Wait a moment. Will you tell me your name? Oichi. I'm a vagrant known as "Blind Oichi". Native town? Suwa District in Shinshu. Madam, is something wrong? The story's so sad, I... I'm in this dirty trade, but I still have normal feelings. May I ask when you lost your sight? I don't want to recall it. But I'll tell you. There was a terrible storm on the night my mother left me. It thundered awfully. While I was looking for her... ...lightning struck a tree. Then all became dark. The dark continues. Madam! Madam! There are corpses in the godown! What? Madam, who are they? Who's been killed? It's Oyone! And there's an old man like a beggar. An old man? Old Man! Why did you die? Fool! How foolish you are! Why couldn't you wait for me? You were able to see your daughter after 20 years and now you're dead. Madam! Who killed these two? Who killed them? Tell me! I don't know. Shut up! Do you mean Oyone entered here alone? You must know. Don't lie! Speak up! Speak up! I feel pity for this old man. He lost his life for love of his daughter. Damn! Compared with him, my mother isn't a human being! They say... ...my mother is leading an indecent life. She's become a dirty and disgusting woman. To my regret I'm blind. So what appears in my dark eyes is my mother's face... ...as I saw her last when I was only seven. She is young and beautiful. So I wanted to grant this old man's wishes at all costs. I wanted to make her happy. Who killed them? Damn you! Speak up! If you don't, I'll kill you. Wait, please! It was my boss's order. Boss? Masagoro? I see. You two teamed up to do this cruel thing. I'll kill Masagoro too. But, Madam, I'll kill you first! Wait, Oichi! Wait! Teacher! Even you cannot stop me this time. I know the man who killed the man and the girl. He is the same man who killed Yasuke, your foster father. Is that true? Yes. It was long ago. Three men tried to kill you beside Yasuke's grave. Remember? The man was behind the three. I remember. I shall never forget the man's voice. He came to call my Grandpa out. You know I fought the man beside Yasuke's mound. Since then I have wondered about him. How I know his identity. Who is he? What is his name? He's called "Devil" Denzo. 20 years ago, there was a team of 3 thieves who burgled many houses. The top man was "Fire" Yasuke. Was my Grandpa a thief? The second man was "Monkey" Nihei who now lies there. The third man was "Devil" Denzo. All of them knew occult arts. The three had a playing card tattooed on their right arms. Denzo sold his pals for money. Yasuke hid himself. Nihei was caught and sent to jail. Denzo kept all the money they had stolen for himself. But afraid his crime might be exposed, he killed his old pals. Where's "Devil" Denzo? Wait for him at Kasumigahara field at dawn. I demanded he come there. I must kill him. Allow me that. Oichi! It's too risky. Oichi! Stop! You better think of her. She'll remain happier... ...if you don't tell her the truth. Mr. Ukita, we're going to kill Oichi! What are you...? Oichi went away in a cold wintry wind alone... ...carrying her sword-cane. I know quite well... ...her sightless eyes were full of tears. THE END
