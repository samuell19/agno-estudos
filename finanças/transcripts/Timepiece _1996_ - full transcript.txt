If we don't getsome new business,we're going under. Then what's going tohappen toyourpeople? I built this businessduring the depression.

Tell herand I woni'll see her for dinner but I'm going to stopby Lawrence's placeon the way home. Hey, George, get thatworried look off your face. (Dog barking) (Gunshot) Oh, my God. Lawrence... Lawrence,it's me. What happened? He came inwith that gun... Mad because miss maudcut him out of her will. He said that I had castsome sort of a spell over her and cheated himout of a valuable clock. I've been in war and I know the lookin a man's eyes when he's fixing to kill, but... Wasn't no clockthat man was after. It was me. I tried to... Tear the gun out of his hand... Iit went off. Tear the gun out of his hanokay. All right. What the hell happened here? Did you kill him? David:No. I did. Mary:I thought you mightlike some tea. Why did you tellthem you did it? Why don't you think I did? Why did you tellbecause you're my husband and I know you. You're not capableof killing anyone. Everyone's capableof killing. It was Lawrence who shot him,wasn't it? I knewhe'd never get a fair trial and even if he was acquitted gannon's friendswould come after him. The only way to protect him was to keep him out of italtogether. How can he meanso much to you... That you're willingto put everything-- everything we haveso muin jeopardy? That you're willingduring world war it everything-- my father wasthe white captain of a negrorifle company and lawrencewas his sergeant. Of a negrothere was a battle in France... And my father's companywas in the middle of it. They were gettingcut to pieces and in the middleof this battle Lawrence... Repaired a machine gun and used it and allowed the wholecompany to escape. He saved my father's life. Dad proposed him for the congressionalmedal of honor.Her's life. Of course,he never received it. It was unthinkablenalfor a negronor.Her's life. To receive such an honorin those daysived it. But... My father never forgot... And neither can I. I'd alreadylost my mother. Forgot... Without Lawrence, I wouldhave lost my father, too. I owe him. I owe this man. We give the drill cuttershalf their previous area. We set up the production sitefor the new prototype drill we give the drill cuttersover in that quadrant.Ea. That'd work. David, thetrial's tomorrow. It's stillnot too late. George, please. How can I beyour friend if I don't tellyou what I feel? How can I belook, I know what I'm doing.Iend if I don't telli don't think you do. A self-defense pleamight get Lawrence off but in any case,he's an old manwith few years left. You've got your wholelife ahead of you. What kind of a lifewould I have if I betrayed a friend? What kind of a lifewouldyou haven't betrayed anyone and even if you had,if I betrayed the man's a negro. You've got to thinkofyourfamily first. I have work. So do you. David, Lawrence is here. I'm sorry to drop byso late, Mr. p, but... No. Come onin, Lawrence. I'm sorry to drop bywe got to talk.R. P, but... Here, have a seat. No, sir. Thank you. I can't let you do this. A seat. Lawrence, you're not goingno, sir. To talk me out of this. Mr. p-- now, don'tget me wrong--u do this. A seat. I appreciate whatyou're trying to do for me but a man's conscienceis a powerful thing. The fact is,I can't live with this. The fact is if you put yourfate in the hands of the law around here,you might not live at all. What if something goes wrongyourand they put you away? The hands what about Mrs. p and missy?What happens to them? Nothing's goingto happen. Nothing's goingto go wrong. I've never known any goodto come of telling a lie. I'm doing thisto protect you. I don't need protection. I didn't do anything wrong. I've always put my trustin the man upstairs. All I have to dois tell the truth. Lawrence... You know and I know that sometimes, thetruth isn't enough. When you crouched bythe body of the shooting victim did you ascertainthat he wasalready dead? When you crouched bythe body of the shootyes, I did. What else didyou determine? Well, ev gannon,the victim had been drinking. I got quite a whiffof 90 proof. Officer Brooks would you please usethe pointer again to show the jury wheremr. Parkin was standing in relationto the victim? Right about there. He had the gunin his hands? Right yes, he did. Who did that gunthe gunbelong to?N his hands? It was purchasedby everen gannon. And where waslawrence Flynn the owner ofthe property? And where wahe was sitting rightlawrence flynnthere on the bed. And how did Lawrence flynnappear to you, officer Brooks? Like he was in shock. I figured since gannon hadtrespassed on his place that he'dkilled the man and Mr. parkin hadtaken the gun from him. Objection. Conjecture. Sustained. You'll disregard Go on. Forget what was Brooks'in your mind, sir.T. Just tell us exactly whatyou said to Lawrence Flynn. I said, "whathappened here? Did you kill him?" And what didflynn say? He didn't say anything. Anmr. Parkinspoke up instead. And what didmr. Parkin say?N't say anything. He said that he did it-- that he shotthe man himself. Please examinethe pistol, Mr. parkin. Is that the weaponin question? Yes, it is. Will you please tell the courtexactly what you saw and what happened when you enteredflynn's workshop? When I enteredthe shop Mr. gannonhad the gun when I enteredpointed at Mr. Flynn. When he saw me, heaimed the gun at me when ibut I knocked thepoinbarrel in the air before he could fire. And in the fightfor the gun it discharged, andmr. Gannon was shot. May I remind you, sir of the testimony ofthe forensic expert? That there were three setsof prints on that gun-- yours, the victim's,and Lawrence Flynn's. Thatmr. Parkin, three setscan you explainhat gun-- how Lawrence victim's,flynn's prints Flynn's. Got on that gun? Yes, sir, I can. As Mr. flynnhas already testified Mr. gannon came into the shopand pulled the gun. They struggledover the gun. Isn't it more likely, sir that you concoctedthis whole story just to protectisn't it mlawrence Flynn? No, sir. Mr. parkin you're an intelligent man. I'm sure I don't haveto explain perjury to you.Parkin so let me just remind you, sir,that you are under oath. I'm sure I don't haveto explaare you the manou.Parkin who fired the shotthat killed everen gannon? Yes, I am. Will the defendantplease rise? The juryhas reached a verdict. The jury findsdavid parkin... Not guilty. That he acted inself-defense. The defendant is herebyreleased from custody and this court is adjourned. Thank God it's over. Your lies ain'tfooling nobody, parkin. You and your black friend your lies athink you canfooling noboget by with this but somebody'syogoing to haveack friend to teach you a lesson. What is hetalking about? Hey, don't worryabout him. Look, I've gotto get to the plant. You take the car and George will give mea ride home. Okay? Hey... Cheer up. We won. I guess so. I don't know what to say. Just say thank God. I didn't know youbelieved in God. Mama, can we hae a picnic tomorrow? That's a good idea. We'll do that. Can daddy come to? I'm afraid daddyhas to work, sweetheart. What time willhe be home? I'm not sure. Can you tell daddyto come kiss megood night I'm not sure.Even if I'm asleep? Can you tell daddyhow about I kiss youbefore you go to sleep? Daddy! Come here. Scoot backdown here, huh? I'm going to tellyou something. I'm going to makedyou a promise. I'm going to telli promise from now on I'm going to tryi'm going tand spend moredyou time at home, okay? Okay. Good night,sweetheart. Sleep tight. Don't let thosebedbugs bite. Good night, daddy. Good night, mama. Good night, sweetheart. (Banging) (Thuds) (Groans) (Sniffs) David, the houseis on fire. Dear God! Andrea! David, the houseis on fire.Mary! Mary! Mary! (Coughing) Andrea. Andrea! Come on, baby. Get some help! Come on! Andrea, come on, baby. (Crying) It's impossible for us to understandthe death of a child-- this precious life that we have nurturedfrom the moment of birth. She's becomeso much a part of us. So we must reach outfrom the darkness of our very human grief with the light we must reach outof faithfrom the darkness as the scripturespromisedur very human grief "come unto me "all ye that laborand are heavy laden and I will give you rest." Mary and David,let me assure you that the only love greater than a parents' love is the love that God hasfor his children. May it give you peace in knowingthat your sweet Andrea will forever rest in the loving armsof our heavenly father. You sureyou're all right? We appreciateeverything you've done, George. Don't worry. I'll take careof things at the plant. Thank you. I'll take carei don't understand it, Mr. p. We spent this last yeargetting rid of the clocks we spent all those yearsi don't understandcollecting. We spent this last yearare you sure you want to...S we spent all those yearsget rid of this last one?Ecting. It's a beautiful piece. That's not quitethe last one. Mary won't let goof the rose gold watch. Can you blame her? You gave her that watchon your wedding day. Can you blami guess I'm not much on sentiment thesedays, Lawrence. She was, uh... She was a very special girl,that little missy. Not a day goes by thati don't think about her. I used to look forward to every day I couldspend with her. I don't havei usmany sunrises left but I'll alwaysbe sorry that... Little miss Andrea hadto die because of me. Lawrence... Andrea didn't diebecause of you. If Cal Avery hadn'thated me so much this would nothave happened. Nobody brought more joy into Andrea's lifethan you did. And if anybody isresponsible for her death, it's me. I think we finally decidedto sell the house. Mary, I know how muchyou love it here. But I'm ready to let go. The only way David willever find peace of mind is if we leave this house. Then he's notdoing any better? Oh, he's doing better if you'retalking about work. The business is thriving but he's never home. Whenever I tryto talk about andreaving he says nothing.Ome. Wheneveryou know, he hasn't evento talk aboubeen to the cemetery since we buried her. I'm sorry. Please, sit down. And it isn't grief I see in his eyes. It's... it's anger. You know, it wasn'tjust Andrea's life that was taken away from me. You know, it wasn'ti lost David, tooe and nowit's Christmas, and...Om me. No matter how hard I try there's nothing to celebrate. Are you sure you won'thave some tea?Hard I try Mary... I'm sorry,father Mike. I wish I had a little moreof the Christmas spirit. Mary, in time, you'll learnto live with your grief but not beforeyou learn to forgive. Mary, ingod's love is basedto live won forgiveness and he forgives us and, in turn, he expects usto forgive our fellow man. How can we?Forgives us maybe it's time to thinkabout someone else. Time to do somethingfor another child. I know a little girlnamed Martha who isn't going to havemuch of a Christmas. Father Mike. How you doing, Ruth? This is Mary a friend of mine. This could we come in? Sorry about the house. It's sort of a mess. Oh, it's fine. Did Martha do this? Yes. She likesto make things. It's very pretty. Where is she? Martha, you don'thave to hide.It's very pretty. It's just father mikeand a friend of his. Martha Anne! I like your Christmas tree. This is my friend Mary. Hello, Martha. She brought you something. It's for you. It's all right.It's yours to keep. (Rattling and jangling) David. I didn't expect youhome so early. Hi, sweetheart. I didn't expect youhello, David. So early. Father. I've had the mostmarvelous afternoon. Father Mike took meto meet the dearest little girl. I gave herad the mosta Christmas giftternoon. Father Mike took meto and her face just lit up.Irl. I wish you'd been there. For the first timesince Andrea died, I... I found myself smiling and her poor motherhas two other children and no money to givethem a Christmas. Smiling who is this family? The mother's really trying hard but things have beenvery difficult for them ever since her husbandwent to prison. Martha's last nameis Avery. She's Cal Avery's daughter. I wasn't tryingto deceive you, Mary. I just wanted you to feelthe spirit of Christmas again. I hope you and David canfind it in your hearts to forgive. Forgive? (Short exhale) I've spent my whole life trying to forgive. First, my motherfor leaving us and now, Cal Avery... And as hard as that's been it could never be as hardas forgiving myself. I let my little girl down. I let her down. I was supposedto take care of her I lprotect her. I failed her. David. Come with me. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas.Merry Christmas. Thank yomerry Christmas. Richard:How do you measure time? Is it in hours and years or is it more likelyin love and relationships? For Mary and davi,is it the lesson was clea: Or is it more likelyin time is precious.Hips? For Mary and davi,it is also elusive and finite. Orbut the thingselyinthat give us hope--ips? For Mary and davi,it is love and family finite. Orbut the thingselyfaith and forgiveness--s? Somehow transcendd davi,even the boundaries of time..
