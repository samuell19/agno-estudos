ON RADIO: [EXCLAIMS] You're with Colin Peters on this late show, and now it's "cuddle in the car" time. Time to pull over, find someone you love and give them a big squeeze, maybe a tender kiss. And who better than Chris Smith to tell you only love can change the situation. So keep cuddly. [ONLY LOVE PLAYING] Oh, let's pay a visit to the old wishing tree. Again? Oh, come on. You know it's only a fairy story of the forest. Those wishes don't ever come true. They do, David. You just have to believe. Once upon a time I believed in Little Red Riding Hood. Well, every wish I've made at the tree's come true. Every one? Well, every serious one. I made a wish the first time we kissed under it. And did your wish come true? Okay, if it makes you happy we'll go there. [ONLY LOVE CONTINUES PLAYING] [BEAST GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [BEAST GROWLING] [JULIA SCREAMING] DAVID: Julia! No!

Hi. Good morning. Kelly, hey. Hi, Harry. Well, what do you think? Terrific story if it's true. Could you write it? Maybe. What the hell do you mean maybe? The point is do you want to go to Exmoor, England, to do some investigative reporting? Do I want an all-expenses trip to Europe? Harry, when do I leave? Hey, now slow down there, Kelly. Now, this is a large expense situation here, baby. I'm stickin' my neck out. I'll get you the story. I'm gonna fix you up with a party, a guy who's gonna give us great mileage. Don't tell me, Indiana Jones? How about a big game hunter from Africa? [LAUGHING] You're kidding me? Mmm. No. I mean it. It's full of drama. Exmoor and feudal England, and the story, disappearing kids. Teenagers. He's in a hurry to get on it. Harry, a game hunter and an English houndlet. It's... It's... Great copy. Who is this out of work, big game hunter? Get this. Daniel Kane. Mean anything to you? Kane? Sure. 50 Minutes did a TV special on him. Harry, I hope you're not gonna team me up with a guy who specializes in bounty hunting ivory poachers. He has an image about as wholesome as sewerage. Kane will just be there to look good in print. The guy's got an impressive reputation. Don't I know it. I hope I don't get the man confused with the beast. It's started. What do they think they are, the local tourist board? Who's it from? The Chief bloody Constable's Office. What do they want? Listen to this. "You are requested to assist and supply "unclassified information "to Miss Kelly O'Neill, U.S.A. subject, "representing the Enquirer Magazine. "The Chief Constable would be grateful "if full cooperation is extended to Miss Kelly O'Neill "in her professional duties as reporter for the Enquirer." Do I detect a Freemason connection? The less said about that, the better. Perhaps she's come to investigate the I.R.A. What? Kelly O'Neill? From New York? Huh. The pip from the Big Apple is here for one damn reason only and that's to sensationalize the Beast of Exmoor. We've managed to maintain a low profile so far, but there's no way we can fob off this inquisitive ferret that's traveled here from New York. I've got the feeling this little lady's gonna give us one hell of a headache. The Chief Constable's got a friggin' nerve. Why doesn't he send someone down from the Public Relations Office, if he wants to please his pals in the Lodge? Remember, walls have ears. But why should we have to put up with more agro? Why? Because the man upstairs has spoken. ♪ Mystery ♪ Just paint the words within the heart of me ♪ Oh, how I long to be ♪ Safe in your arms tonight ♪ My blood runs cold ♪ Each time I hear your name ♪ Feelings I can't explain ♪ A man of mystery ♪ What must I do to win your heart? ♪ I've tried so hard to find a clue ♪ But still we are so far apart ♪ Tell me what must I do ♪ Mysteries ♪ Are rivers cold and clear ♪ Fill my heart with fear ♪ Oh, mystery This meeting has all the charm and appeal of an appointment with a dentist.

[MYSTERY CONTINUES PLAYING] Hey, Daniel Kane. Mr. Goldberg. Did you have a nice flight? I slept all the way. This here is Miss Kelly O'Neill. Miss O'Neill, pleased to meet you. Care to sit down? Why don't I get you a drink? What will you have? I'll have a glass of orange juice, please. How about you, Kelly? I'll have another martini straight up. So, what's your expert opinion on this, Mr. Kane? I'm not an expert on creatures of the unknown, Kelly. You really believe this is an unnatural phenomenon? Yes. You really think this is something special? Not just a wild dog or something? I don't think it's just any one animal. Our readers are not uneducated natives with minds controlled by the rantings of a witch doctor, Mr. Kane. Nice juice, Harry. [LAUGHING] That's great, Daniel. Now, I'm convinced that this has the makings of a monster story. Excuse the pun. It was unintentional. Well, let's just hope we don't make monster fools out of ourselves. And the pun is intentional. Now, Daniel, I need your cooperation to create reader interest. It's essential that you make a big entrance into Exmoor. I've arranged TV and press coverage. If it looks good, man, we'llnetwork it right across America. Now, why don't we just get it on. This is a good idea, right? Even a blood-tempered lioness has been known to mellow on a full stomach. HARRY: [LAUGHING] That's great, Daniel. Details later. Right now, just let's relax and listen to the music. How are you today, my friend? I understand. The wind moves your ancient roots and you wake from old age. You are such a statuesque tree, proud and mighty. Why did you anger the lord of lightning? [BIRDS CAWING] I think it is time for me to move on. The forest becomes a little unsettled when I pay too much attention to just one of her trees. And we all know how she reacts when she is angered, don't we? [LAUGHING] MAN ON RADIO: Two teenagers are still missing tonight near Exmoor, in Devon. They were last seen leaving the cinema in Exmouth. [PHONE RINGING] A police spokesman denied local fears that the Beast has struck again, but admits that they have no strong leads. Yes? Please ask them to come in. [MAN CONTINUES CHATTERING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Kelly. Hey, Daniel. Sorry to bother you, buddy, but I have an urgent call. I've gotta head on back to New York. I just wanted to say goodbye. Keep the copy rolling, guys. We're gonna have the networks back home screaming for more. And I'll publish just as soon as we get the story wrapped up. I'll be moving into the forest tomorrow. Right. Now the local police will giveyou all the help and cooperationyou need. Any trouble goin' down, Kelly has the number of our manin the Chief Constable's office. He'll take care of problems. What do you mean you'll be moving into the forest tomorrow? This is a luxury hotel, full of people. I don't think the Beast has a room here. And I've gotta be where the action is in the forest. How the hell will I find you each morning? Well, there's room for you in the tent. You want me to share a tent with you, in that forest? Uh-uh. There's a man-eating beast in there. Look, Harry wants a story. We have to find the action. Kelly, you owe me one, remember? Come on. Let's quit horsing around here. My job is on the line. This deal is costing us a fortune. You gotta get it any way you can. If you don't, it'll be a pink slip for me, baby. Hey, come on! Remember me? I gave you the big break. Remember? Okay. I need this story as badly as you guys. But let me make it clear, I do not expect to find the Beast in the tent. [CREAKING] Brandy. Brandy. Here, boy. Brandy. Brandy. Brandy. Brandy. Come on, boy. Brandy. Come on, boy. Brandy. Brandy. [BEAST GROWLING] [BRANDY YELPING] [BEAST GRUNTING] Please! No! Stop it, please! Mommy! [SCREAMING] The restful shades of autumn add color to each day, with the raindrops dancing through the woods to guide me on my way. But in the hush of twilight, the shadows start to fall. Beware of the night beast's call. Did you hear all that, you creatures of the forest? This is your friend, Wilbur Sledge, saying, "Take care. "As the restless moon rises, beware." Oh. These are nasty scratches. Have you had a run-in with a wild animal? Shut your mouth. [WOLF HOWLING] [BEAST BREATHING HEAVILY] [BEAST GRUNTING] [WHISPERING] Stop typing, Kelly. Don't make a sound. [SCREAMING] What is it, Kelly? Tell me. What is it? [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] It's over for tonight. Thank you, Miss O'Neill. We were advised to expect you. As I understand it, you were asked to cooperate with us and assist where necessary. As long as it does not disrupt police business. There are a lot of unanswered questions, Superintendent, and it is reasonable to expect the police to have answers to some of these questions. There's nothing reasonable aboutthe situation we're investigating, so perhaps the normal approach is not relevant. Mr. Kane is convinced we're dealing with the unnatural. There are many forms of unnatural behavior. The proposition is not unnaturalbehavior, Superintendent, but the presence of an unnatural form. At this stage, I'm afraid I cannot comment. [RUSTLING] Please stop it. I'm scared. I'm sure there's something out there. You don't believe in all that crap about werewolves, do you? What's the use, if you know that you won't enjoy it? I think you feel a bit frightened. Me? You must be joking. Wait. Well done, my children. Behind closed doors you'll offend no one. The police were hardly a fountain of information. I thought we were playing it honestly. They really do have little to go on. I don't believe they have a clue. The opinion I formed was that they were hoping we could supply some leads. It's, uh, time for the confessional, Daniel. I am enjoying this commission and I misjudged you. That's welcome news. Which? My enjoyment or my misjudgment? Both. Thank you. That'll be the ninth sheep in just six weeks I found in that state, Sergeant. Two of 'em were my best lambs. Could barn dogs or a fox do that kind of damage? Oh, they could. If you ask me, I'd say that no dog or fox is responsible. Why is that? If you listens at those two dogs of mine barking, those two dogs are afraid of nothing. I reared them that way. Last night, about midnight, they started up a hell of a ruckus. I thought, "There's some sheep busting going on." So I crept down the stairs and went across the yard and opened the gate. Those two dogs were going crazy. I thought to myself, "If they get their teeth into a poacher, "there's no way he's going to be stealing sheep "for a long time to come." You're entitled to protect your property. I knows that. But now there's no rustler out there. What was it? That's something you'll have to tell me. It was weird. If you didn't see it, how do you know it was weird? Well, it were the dogs. Immediately, I opened the gate, I expected them to fly out. But, no. They stood there tremblin'. I never knowed anything like it. If I hadn't seen it with me own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. But things like that ain't natural. You know what I'd really like to do now? Go to a real English pub. I've heard so much about them. Why not? It's one of the few things thathasn't changed for the worse. What do you think of this Mr. Daniel Kane? Obviously the strong, silent type. Charles Bronson, eat your heart out. He didn't have very much to say, did he? Do you think this business was sparked off by the planned development for the new forest? It's possible. There's a lot of people unhappyabout the Holiday Chalet plans. Writing protest letters to the local newspapers is one thing, but ripping innocent sheep apart. I think we're dealing with a psychopath. Hmm. You're right there, sir. Do you think this character, Daniel Kane, will be of any help? Or is it just a gimmick? The way we're progressing with this case I'd accept help from Superman, Woody Allen, Groucho Marx and/or Uncle Tom Cobbley. "An out and out professional" was the way he was described to me. I still don't understand why a real pro should want to chase a shadow in the wind. We all have our price. Perhaps he needs the money. But what I am concerned about is the fact he's been granted a permit to carry firearms. Now, that has to be the Brotherhood of the Freemasons making a family connection. That's all we need, a Wild West show. [FOLK MUSIC PLAYING] How are you, Mr. Rooney? How are you, Mr. Clancy. Good evening, folks. Sure it is a lovely evenin'. I'm grand, thank you. Yes, yes. I thought I was never going to make it. Me mouth feels like it's lined with sandpaper. You better watch your words, Mr. Rooney. You'll be having people thinkingyou have a block of wood for a head. Put it on the slate now. There's a good lad. That was worth all the agony of a terrible thirst. [EXCLAIMS] I agree with every word, Mr. Clancy. Shall we rest ourselves in the corner? Why not? Can you believe that? That's real Irish charm. They're beautiful. Why don't we join them? It could prove even more interesting. Sure. I'd like that. Excuse me, gentlemen. This is Miss Kelly O'Neill from New York. She'd like to ask you a few questions. Kelly O'Neill. That's as Irish as a Guinness Stout. You took the words right out of me mouth, Mr. Rooney. But I was going to say Bushmills Irish Whiskey. What'll you have, gentlemen? Guinness or Bushmills Irish Whiskey? Oh. You're a real gentleman, sir. Would it be possible to have two Bushmills? Excuse me. Well, I would never have believed that. You've got to be Irish. Well, my grandmother hailed from County Cork and my grandfather was a Kerry man. I knew it. You're Irish. Irish American, to be exact, sir. Irish American you might be, but your pretty looks come from Ireland. The colleens of Kerry and Cork are pretty as the morning flowers. Oh, for sure they are, Mr. Clancy. Oh, that's very kind of you, sir. Is that what I think it is? I'm driving. Miss O'Neill is seekinginformation concerning the Beastof Exmoor. It's a terrible thing you're asking. Why is that, Mr. Rooney? It's touched by the devil. That's why, Miss O'Neill. CLANCY: You'd be wise to leave the terrible thing alone. You think so? Absolutely. That is a great pity. ROONEY: A great pity? Why's that? Because there's a lot of money to be made. Is that right? Is that right? Would you be having any idea how much? Oh. You're two fine people, as good as ever I met. How can we help? Should I tell them about Patrick O'Riley, Mr. Rooney? I don't know why you're after asking me, Mr. Clancy. These are our friends. Why shouldn't you tell them? This is a terrible, sad story now. About three months ago, it was. Mr. Rooney and myself were sitting at this very table with Patrick O'Riley. God rest his soul. After a couple of jars, Patrick left to go home to the missus. It was on the way home that he came face to face with the terrible creature. Your friend actually saw the Beast? Our late friend, ma'am. Are you saying he was killed by the Beast? He was. In a manner of speaking. What manner of speaking are you referring to? Well, when Patrick cast his eyes on the terrible thing, he thought he'd come face to face with a creature of the devil himself. Frightened out of his life, he was. Rooted to the spot, he was. He couldn't move a muscle. So he flew home. He escaped. But overnight, that very night, his great head of hair turned the color of white. Did Mr. O'Riley describe the Beast? For sure, he did. On many an occasion. What did he say it looked like? Huge and hideous it was. So terrible was the sight of it, that the unfortunate Patrick had trouble talking about it. Understandable. Such awful things should not bespoken about by God-fearing people. Is that all he said about the Beast? Is that all? Gentlemen, there's a lot of money to be made, but much more detail is required. Would you know of anyone else who could help us with some information? Have you spoken to Wilbur Sledge? No. Where could we locate this Mr. Sledge? Well, if he's not in his house, he could be anywhere in the forest. Do you believe Mr. Sledge will have some information for us? Mr. Sledge is a real queer fellow, but nothing goes on in the forest he doesn't know about. Do you have his address? Oh, yes I have. I'm sorry, ma'am, but Mr. Clancy's the educated one. If you'll excuse me, Mr. Kane, but how much money would be paid for the cage and the Beast, dead or alive? If Miss O'Neill was told before anyone else, we could be talking ten, maybe fifteen thousand pounds. Mother have mercy. Is there such an amount of money in the world? Fifteen thousand pounds? You must excuse us. We have work to do. Well, have one for the road with us. That's real sweet of you but, uh, we must go. Fifteen thousand pounds! Such fine people. The finest. I hope you realize, Mr. Rooney, that you and I will shortly have a clean slate. God bless them. And you, too, Mr. Clancy. A police statement will be released this afternoon. Yes. That's the earliest we could... No, I can't comment on that story. No. Thanks. Another news hound? [PHONE RINGING] Is that veterinary surgeon's report. Mmm. Yes? Oh, sorry, Anne. Yes. Send them in, will you? Thanks. Tarzan and Jane have just arrived. Aye, God. That's all we need. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. Good morning. Please sit down. Sit down. Still no comment on the Beast of Exmoor, Superintendent? I would like your opinion on which species of animal's hide this one's covered. Wolf. Where did it come from? It was found near the body of the mutilated pet dog that belonged to Katy Ferguson, the missing little girl. Do you have a veterinarial autopsy of the dog? It doesn't make for pleasant listening. Would you like to hear it? Yes, please. The report reads, "On this date, a postmortem examination "was carried out under my supervision "on the body of a canine. "The examination revealed that death was instantaneous, "due to a broken cervical cord caused by a very severe blow "from an animal paw or human hand. "There were deep lacerations on the body "and severe wounds in the area of the throat. "Large pieces of flesh had been ripped from the body, "resulting in an extreme loss of blood. "The nature of the wounds, "including the teeth marks found on the body "indicate the assailant to be alarge predator-type animal of the feline species. "From tests carried out on the body and close examination of the wound, "the possibility that the attacker could have been a member of the wolf family "is ruled out. "Signed, Melvin Carr, M.R.C.V.S." The wolf hair must be a coincidence then, or a deliberate attempt to mislead you. What do you think, Mr. Kane? You're the detective, Mr. Lowe. You tell me. In all honesty, I don't know. I'm baffled by the evidence of a wolf in the area. And, if there is no wolf, who isit who's trying to mislead us? None of this makes sense. The constabulary seems to have driven down a dead end. Shall we all head for Baker Street? Number 221B, that is. There is a difference betweenfact and fiction, Miss O'Neill, a distinction you may not fully appreciate. Are you suggesting that the great Sherlock Holmes, not to mention the venerable Dr.Watson, are mere figments of fiction? Ball's in our court, Miss O'Neill. We acknowledge that. Deuce, Sergeant. Hey, there. You're that couple camping in the forest, aren't you? Yes. I got a letter here for Wilbur Sledge. Uh-huh. You tell him he'll have to come pick it up. I won't go near that forest, not with that Beast lurking about there. Yes, we'll do that. I wouldn't be surprised if he ain't got something to do with it. He's a right weirdo, and no mistake. I'm having trouble with this map. Just stop and see if anybody's in that hut. Maybe they'll know the way. KELLY: Hello. I'm, uh, sorry to disturb you, but could you kindly direct me to Middlewood? I have this rough map here, but it hasn't exactly stopped me from losing my way. I would like to get to Middlewood. Could you help me? Please? Have you come all the way from America to get screwed by Wilbur Sledge? Hey. You need a strong mouthwash. I know what you need. It's not a mouthwash. Whatever you think I need, you can be sure you haven't got it. What are you waiting for, Weasel? Give us a show. You people are sick. Hey. Come on, you guys. Look, I'm really sorry if I upset you. I just want to get to Middlewood. What do you want with Wilbur Sledge? Wilbur loves animals. What's the betting she's some kind of special animal? Well, there's only one way to find out. WOMAN: That's it, Weasel, get her on the floor. Who are you people? I'm the local sheriff and landowner of these parts. Sure. Well, can you kindly behave like a responsible person? WOMAN: What're you waiting for, Weasel? That's right, Weasel. Get her on the floor! The lady's giving you bad advice, Weasel. Well, if it isn't the big gamehunter from Africa, Daniel Kane. Right first time. Let the lady go, Weasel. Weasel will only take orders from me. Okay. I'm telling you to tell Weasel to let the lady go. In these parts I don't take orders. I give them. Ferret, shut his big mouth. Not bad with boys, are you, old man? How do you make out with men? I don't. My scene is with women. But then, I respect the preference of others. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] SLEDGE: Welcome to my home, Miss O'Neill, Mr. Kane. Thank you, Mr. Sledge. You look surprised that I should know you. I learned a long time ago never to be surprised. A shrewd observation, Mr. Kane. But we hardly live in the surroundings where you have made your impressive reputation. A fatal mistake has the same conclusion no matter where it's made, Mr. Sledge. Fear not, Miss O'Neill. I possess no mystical powers. I just happen to be an avid reader of our local newspaper, The Exmoor Times. Will you have some tea? Do me the honor of sharing someof the humble food I have prepared. You've prepared food for us? Just some modest country fare. Ronnie McDonald and Colonel Sanders have no place in these parts. Thank you. We'd be delighted to accept your hospitality, Mr. Sledge. Please. How did you know we were gonna call on you? You seek information on the Beast. The Beast's habitat is the forest. A visit to me was inevitable. Would you prefer something stronger than tea? I do have some scrumpy. Tea's fine for me, please. What's scrumpy? I'll explain to you later. But, if you want to keep your senses, stay with the tea. This is game pie. This is pheasant with herb stuffing. Cheeses made with goat's milk with fruit flavoring. The bread is homemade and the tea will be made with spring water. It all looks wonderful. Thank you very much, Mr. Sledge. Would you be willing to assistus with some information on theBeast, Mr. Sledge? Why don't we become a little less formal? My friends call me Wilbur. What do you wish to know? Well, the first question is, does the Beast exist? And, uh, secondly, is its reputation a valid one? Make absolutely no mistake, Kelly, it does exist and it has no false reputation. Have you seen it? No living person has seen it. Aren't you afraid of living here alone? No. Why should I be? I harm nothing or no one. I only wish to conserve the natural order of the forest. The Beast has no business with me. The ferocity with which it kills, have you ever come across anything like it before? I have never encountered the unnatural. You really believe we're dealing with an unnatural phenomenon? Yes, I do. You'll probably have some difficulty in accepting this diagnosis. In all honesty, I do. Mr. Kane has advanced this theory from day one. Good for you, Daniel. Wilbur, how do you explain the missing teenagers? The poor creatures are dead. You sound very positive. Have you told this to the police? The police are trained to deal with life and death on the streets. In the wild, they can only chase shadows. Besides, the people of the village, and that includes the police, believe Wilbur Sledge to be a weird eccentric. Some say mad, that I should be locked up in a mental asylum. That's cruel. So is life, Kelly. Especially when the greed of man runs riot. Here in the forest, I live in peace with the inhabitants. They're all my friends, and I am theirs. You're a lucky man to have foundsuch contentment, Wilbur. I know that, Daniel. Anyway, when we have finished our meal why don't you join me on a walk in the forest? Do you think Kelly will be all right? Don't worry, Daniel. The Beast will not harm her in my home. [BIRD CAWING] [SCREAMING] What the hell do you think you're doing, Mr. Rooney? What am I doing, Mr. Clancy? That's something I need to be asking you! [BEAST GRUNTING] [TWIG SNAPPING] [BEAST GRUNTING] [BEAST GROWLING] [SOBBING] [SCREAMING] Get away from me! Oh, God! [KELLY SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] It's all right, Kelly. It's all right. [SOBBING] Oh, Daniel. It's okay. [WOLF HOWLING] Tis the thrill of the hunt, Mr. Rooney. Sends the blood coursing through the veins. I bet your heart's pounding. You speak for yourself, Mr. Clancy. If you want to know the truth, me feet's killing me and I'm feeling bushed. You can be such a contrary man, Mr. Rooney. [EXCLAIMS] Is... Is that what it is, what I'm thinking? Your eyes are not mirroring a piece of fantasy, Mr. Rooney. Ah, you're a good man, Mr. Clancy. [LAUGHING] [BOTH SIGH] I don't like it, Mr. Rooney. I heard them tell terrible stories of demons and the like when I was a boy, back in the old country. Oh, that was the work of that old hag, Nellie O'Brien. Me grandmother used to say she was a witch. That was years ago, Mr. Rooney. My thoughts are not on Nellie O'Brien, God rest her soul, but on poor Pat O'Riley. I wish you hadn't mentioned that, Mr. Clancy. Not now. We're onto a goldmine, if we can find the... You don't have to mention the name, Mr. Rooney. I'm with you all the way. But there are some things more important than money. But fifteen thousand pounds. That's something more than just money, Mr. Clancy. I know. And me heart and me mind grieves for it. But you can't spend money in the beyond. We enjoy life, Mr. Rooney. We have some days better than others. But, overall, life isn't bad to us. You should've done what your grandmother wanted and gone into the priesthood, Mr. Clancy. You're a wise man when you wants to be. You have a kind way with you, Mr. Rooney. And I'm not so wise. Otherwise we wouldn't be here now. This place is spooked. I think it's time we left. Nothing would please me more. There is just one question I would like to know the answer to, Mr. Clancy. What would that be? If the most terrible thing happened and we were, uh, dispatched to our Maker by the... You don't have to say the name, Mr. Rooney. I know what you're meaning. Will we be buried in consecrated ground? Holy Mary, Mother of God! What a question to ask a man in the black of night, surrounded by terrible danger! I'd never lie contented unless I was laid to rest in consecrated ground, Mr. Clancy. Will you stop your nonsense now! My nerves are stretched tighterthan the wires of a piano. I'm sorry, Mr. Clancy, but it's important to me. [BEAST GROWLING] Do you hear? It calls me. The Beast is lonely. It needs my friendship. I should go to the forest and walk with the Beast. You are safe, my little friend. It is I the Beast calls. Hello, Anne. Can you get me Professor Sanderson? Yes. Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Thanks. So who did the farmer think caused the injuries to the sheep? He didn't say. The newspapers are going with the Beast of Exmoor, but some of the locals seem to think it's a wolf pack. That kind of publicity could stop tourists coming to Middlewood. And look where the proposed site for the Holiday Village is. Thanks, Anne. Let's see what the vet's got tosay about those strange teeth marks. Hello. Professor Sanderson? I thought I'd find you both here. [DANIEL CHUCKLING] Hello. Hello, Wilbur. Will you join us for lunch, Wilbur? Oh, no thank you. I've already eaten. Please have some coffee with us. Why not? That'll be fine. I was going to suggest, Daniel, that you both come over to my place tonight. That is, if you have nothing more important to do. I'd like that. How about you, Kelly? Suits me fine. Good. I'll expect you then. [GROWLING] Daniel? Daniel? Are you there? [CREAKING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] All right, Kelly. It's me, Kane. Oh, my God! What's happened? I heard the gunshots and my mind freaked out! Has somebody shot you? I'll explain later. You'll have to drive me to Wilbur's. Wilbur's? Those injuries are serious! You've gotta get to a hospital! I've got to get to Wilbur's urgently. The keys to the jeep are in my pocket. [ENGINE STALLING] [ENGINE REVVING] Wilbur! It's essential that I give you an anti-tetanus injection. Hold this for me, Kelly. These wounds are nasty. You should have qualified medical assistance. I found one of the missing teenagers, dead. He's in the barn. It's not a pretty sight. SLEDGE: You must rest now. You are a master of the art of mind over matter, Daniel. Did you learn that in Africa? It's all part of the jungle law of survival. [GROWLING] Daniel's awake. I'll go and get him some coffee. Oh, no. The headlamps on the jeep have been wasting. I better step outside and turn 'em off. [GASPING] [GROWLING] [KELLY SCREAMING] [WHIMPERING] Help! Stay with Wilbur. No, Daniel! Wait for help! I must inform the police. Daniel's weak! He could be killed! He's tangling with a monster. [GROWLING] [PANTING] [BEAST GROWLING] [GRUNTING] [GROWLING] [DANIEL SCREAMING] [GROANS] [SCREAMING] [BEAST GROWLING] [WOLF HOWLING] Welcome back. You nailed him, Kane. We all owe a great deal to you. And I have to admit, there were certain times when even I thought we were up against a werewolf. But it turned out to be Badger. I'm sorry for all the trouble. The secret is out now. Badger was my stepbrother. No one knew. He made me agree not to tell a soul. You see, we inherited all of the forest land and vast acres of farmland froma deed of trust left by our father. Superintendent Lowe has seen all the legal papers. Please believe me, my friend. Badger meant no harm. He just wanted to conserve the forest, like you and me. But it all became too much for him. He was a misguided zealot. But the Beast he is not. We believe we have our man. Mr. Kane did a magnificent job and will get full credit. And I do not propose to allow anyone or anything to decimate that credit. Wilbur is right. Badger's not the Beast. It is still out there. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Did you get a story to please New York, by the way? Harry Goldberg's over the moon, although he's not happy about the fact that the Beast could still be at large. I'm sure he'll initially go with the police version, that the Beast was Badger. But Harry's a master at getting the full mileage out of any story. [ONLY LOVE PLAYING] Lisa? Lisa! Lisa!
