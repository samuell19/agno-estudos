Perfect! You did a beautiful Job gentlemen. Beautiful! The bar is open. Why don't you have a drink? You deserve it. - You got the Tickets? - In my pocket. The girl from the airline delivered them herself. He's not going to like this, George. Oh, don't think about that, Cass. Think about the money we now have. That they would have had. Joey, I don't want any trace of these bodies found. It was perhaps inedible. That the man made world would one day require a ultimate woman. a wonder woman. that day has come. you are that ultimate woman, Diana. you will be the wonder woman. So having parted from the many sisters you're known all the days of your life. now part from these few who are your closest friends. part from them with the same dignity and strength, your new life will demand. you make a sacrif?ce i could never make, Diana. and i would go in your place without hesitation. to the wonders of the outside world. there is no greater wonder then... the peace and joy we have on our island, ?ngela. how i shall miss you. and you my sister. you're endowed with extraordinary wisdom,love and strength, daughter. and now you're charged with a mission. to accomplish that mission you must leave this island. you must adopt other ways. for that is the only true means, taking our only pure love of justice and light, to that world beyond our's here. there's deep sadness with having you leave us. but there's also joy. the hope that your presents in the world of man... will bring closed eyes to the genuine valor of women. that you'll never lose , the sensitivity. that is our real strength. you carry with you our love. yes,sir. Of course I understand the implications, commissar. I think we can work out a compromise. their willing to make a exchange Nitski for Lao Shi. consider the proposal, I'll phone back. Both sides are considering an exchange, Mr. Secretary. I'll phone you back when a decision is reached. i want all available agents in here at once, Diana. - their already on their way. - good. i reserved the computer and their waiting for your call to the data bank, line 3A. you're always a step ahead of me. data bank, line3A. well here's the day's surprise. i know it's small. but it's the best i could do on short notice. that's sweet. thanks. yes, sir? send them in when they get here Dee. their here, sir. gentlemen, go right on in. dinner, Dee? don't answer now. think about it. think about it gentlemen... the complete list of all our agents in the field, their cover identities and their specific assignments, has been stolen. and with that list the key to every diplomat and military code... in use by our goverment through out the world. each was broken down into five parts... all five parts being necessary to use any of them. there was dozens of decoy books planted in various Embassies... and consulets through out the world, none of those was touched. just the ten valuable books. they was kept in highly secret hiding places. in Berlin, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Paris, and London. they was replaced simultaneously and ingeniously... just after our agents had finished reporting in. as you all know a agent in the field reports in every 72 hours... or at a prearranged time at 10 minute intervals. that means we are completely out of touch with all of our agents for the next 72 hours. they can't be reached or warned between Communications. if those lists and codes fall into the hands of our adversaries... our people will be at their mercy for the next 3 days. completely vulnerable to be apprehended or eliminated. 39 of our best intelligent operatives. and with those 39 lives lost our entire organization... will cease to exist in that one deadly sweep. now the thief knows that and has set his price for returning those 10 books accordingly. 15 million dollars in cash. he has given us 48 hours to gather the money. he will contact us again in one of our top secret codes... as to where and how the ransom is to be paid. giving all the preference information the data base of computers... has come up with only 3 individuals or organizations capable of this enterprise. The british crime Cartel, headed by Winston Thomas... with headquarters in Llandaff Wales. Charles Sangry, Freelance operative without nationality. last known location, Caracas, Venezuela. and Abner Smith. a contractor that sets up intelligent operations for any number of nations. last known location: Cap d'Antibes, France.. never photographed. this is a car used in a operation last year. you each got 1 hour to devise a counterplan... to recover those books and save those lives. alright. the clock is ticking get on it. Well, Dee what do you think? i'm afraid i can't have dinner with you tonight. probably just as well. odds are i'll be in Caracas by dinner time. Bob. you will be careful? see you later. what do you think, Dee? what can anyone think with that many live in jeopardy. Steve! i'll be away from the office for awhile. a dental appointment.i lost a filling It happens. i hope you feel up to coming in tomorrow. you'll never know how long these things can take. - phone in let me know. - first chance i get. I can call the agency, so that someone can replace me while i'm gone. nobody can replace you. times like this i really worry about you. i know. but please don't. i'm sure i can handle it. if anyone can, you can. i still worry . thanks. which dentist are you gonna try? i think the french one. intuition? i would have guess the english? "C'est la vie". 702. one of our very best. Yes thanks. wonder woman. she's here. - room 702. - hold on. you was right, Mr. Smith. she just checked into the hotel Saint Germain, room 702. marvelous. it's one of ours. she should be eliminated. just delay, George, 72 hours. just delay, George. 72 hours. Violence and mayhem that's so gross. he can hold her in her own? if he's able to. i don't agree with you, Mr. Smith. this isn't a democracy, George? we don't take a vote here. - you're the boss. - yes, George, i am. Joey, welcome the lady , politely. thank you that won't be necessary. it's ok. HELLO? My name is George Calvin. now you don't know me, but you just passed me in the lobby. you are the most beautiful woman i ever seen in my life. and if you don't have dinner with me tonight... i'm just gonna have to throw myself from the top of this building. and maybe I can help you to find what you came to Cap d'Antibes for.. well, then how can i refuse. - how about 8 Oclock. - in the lobby. I seriously doubt that you will have success that you think you will, George. yachts, sails like clouds. you need a angel, never George, never. 10 thousand saids you're wrong. - you got a bet. - you're on. i think you're find Cap d'Antibes a very exciting city. Oh, it is. so far a gentleman has dropped in on me from the roof of the elevator. and my room is bugged. then you didn't get the room with the trap door in the floor? they never bug that room. That's a relief, George. and , then you called me. why? - to invite you sailing. - on Mr. Smith's Yacht? i was out this morning. it was warm. there was a wind. the sails looked like clouds. all that was missing. was a angel to make it perfect. come sailing with me tomorrow. can i bring you a appetizer, mister? Champagne? I would like a glass of Hermitage Blanc, if you don't mine. a bottle of your very best Hermitage Blanc. ice the glasses. very good, mister. i don't know that wine. it's a inexpensive rome wine. but it has its own style. but you deserve Champagne. even if i don't like it. there are some things in this world... worth learning to like. Voil?, merci. to this night. You are so totally captivating.. let me make love to you. - why? - because your eyes reach into... you misunderstood me. i didn't me why should you want to... i meant why should i. You don't find me attractive? appealing? yes. but there's quite a few attractive and appealing men in this world. well i don't care about the others. Oh. George. you don't? you're fast. i like you. thank you. Now if you excuse me. there's no reason to run away. Oh, i know that, George. goodnight. special line, A1267, ?tats-Unis, op?rateur. "Merci". Mr. Steve Trevor. - Trevor. - you sound tired, Steve. oh this has been a tough one. but you did pick the right dentist, the frenchman. the english dentist is in the hospital in Belgrade, and the other one's is on a long vacation in China. how's it going? somewhat involved. But I am making progress.. do you want me to send you some company for moral support? no everythings fine. we all miss you, Dee. we did hear about the delivery we have to make. A messenger will be here to pick it up. do we know who it is the messenger? No! No! HELLO? we haven't met. and i really hate to have a guest at one my parties. That i haven't welcomed personally. then you weren't in your car when it attempted to run me down earlier? i was totally unaware that anything like that happened. i'll discuss it with George, i promise. now ,to more pleasant things. now if you like to swim, you'll find bathing attire in the cabana. well that's very kind of you, but... i only came by to rescue the books you borrowed. you have my word of honor, my word of honor. that they will be returned. the moment... that i have the proper response from your mr. Trevor. i find it very difficult to accept your word of honor... with 39 lives at stake, mr. Smith. Ah. you do know who i am. i was wandering if you did. well not really seriously. i was relativity certain of you. about those lives, mr. Smith. those agents you placed in jeopardy. i haven't really? mr. Trevor will pay the ransom. i'll return the books. and the agents will remain, undercover secret and safe. given any choice i'd spend the rest... of the evening talking to you but I really must go now. enjoy your stay in France. - Voil?, mademoiselle. - Merci. she's on her way up. oh, my dear what brings you to my door at this hour? no naughtiness i hope? My key. i've locked my key in my room. pity. why don't you come in and tell me all about it? might i impose on you to? oh no. no trouble at all my pleasure. come in, come in. would you mind calling my room and waking up my husband? he's a very sound sleeper and he doesn't hear me knocking. Oh, yes, yes . of course your husband. what room might that be? 702. we're just across the hall. Certainty. i'll call him straightaway. you're not surprised. i wanted to surprise you. now why wasn't you surprised. i take it the trunk is for me? I had to guess your dimensions, but... but i think you'll fit . now my friends are going to take you sailing for a few days. any place you choose. - whether i like it or not. - i think You'll learn to like it. if it's not clear to you let me make it clear. Abner convinced that your life is necessary.. i'm not. i never would have guessed it George. so don't force us to damage you before we put you in the trunk. Abner wouldn't like that. and since he's still the boss, i'd hate to have to explain it to him. i just can't let you put me in that trunk, George. i thought you couldn't. she's here now waiting for you. that's impossible. we have a hour lead on her. I'm standing here looking at her. It's that woman. tell him we will leave the airport by any road.. and tell him to have the messenger sent to Steve Trevor. assuming our instuctions we had our lab people check out by every method. Except probing and X-ray. and our guess is it's not a bomb. those instuctions came from the thief. And I'm to be alone when i open it. There could be there's a assassin in there, Steve. Sound tests picked up a heartbeat or something like it. I have no choice but follow their instructions, Colonel. it's a necessary risk. alright. - be careful, Steve. - thanks, Maurice. Tell him. She's in her room HELLO? this is George. i just got in. Under the circumstances, I didn't think that you would be sailing the Mediterranean. Oh, no. where you go, i go. i'm sure you didn't call to chat, George. i called to invite you to lunch. Some place very public, I imagine. Well. What could be more public then the Governor's Grill at the Peregrine? why George? i've been told to make you a proposition. business of course. - how about 12:30? - fine. shall i pick you up? i brought your trunk. that's very thoughtful, George. But I just assume meet you there. Try not to be late. this is room 519. send up a container of milk and a saucer. and tell the waiter to let himself into the room, but to take his shoes off in the hall first. yes. that's what i said. And tell him there's a 50 dollar tip if he gets here in the next minute.. stay right there. now pour some milk in the saucer. then walk slowly over here. and put it down on the floor. - but lady... - don't talk. just put the milk down and slide it as close to me as you can. Oh, i'm sorry. i almost forgot your tip. how can you stand up after that? it would have been a lot tougher if the snake had bitten me. yeah! she's late. you didn't happened to arrange something... that would pervent her from coming here did you George? Do you think I'd do anything contrary to your orders? i misjudged you, George. she's being seated, at your table. did you order a drink? i prefer not to drink at lunch, thank you. you know... I'll spend the rest of my life wishing that... i met you under other circumstances. George, i seriously doubt that any woman... could survive in your memory longer than a few days. so do i. But that line usually has a very disarming effect.. Let's stop nonsense and get down to business. i'm empowered to offer you 1 million dollars... to form a professional alliance with my employer. well that's very impressive, but, no thanks.. 2 million dollars? let's just not hagel. What's your top offer.. 5 million now. Even you.. could find a lot to buy with 5 million dollars. i have everything i want. except for the books and for the safety of those 39 agents.. - that's your final word? - Final. you've heard Abner's offer, you haven't heard mine. i think i know what your's is, George. I won't underestimate you again.. And I won't ask for Abner's approval. If you turn up again, I'll kill you. Now you see that I knew what your offer would be.. do enjoy your present. George. yes of course I'm calling from a public telephone booth. you're not where someone can get after you with a car. Steve, I'm perfectly safe.. now you're suppose to put the money where? Two leather saddle bags then take the animal to a place in Nevada. A ghost town called Alba.. - at 4:00 this afternoon. - and that's all? Give the Burro a command in Spanish, and slap him on the romp and leave. Well don't stand behind the Burro when you give him a SWAT.. phone in this evening? If i have anything to tell you. BYE. i bring you love from your mother, Diana. and when you return to the island give her my love. i will. My mission is to bring you a message of great sadness, sister.. one from among us has fled the island. which of us? ?ngela. And so, your mother spoke of according to our just laws.. ?ngela is not to be trusted. She must now face her times of trial alone. so be it, sister. - to my great sadness. - and mine. i am delighted you decided to accept my invitation to join in this enterprise.... ?ngela. well how can i refuse? I'm curious to as when my part in it begins. Now! find George and go to the glen.. - he knows where it is. - alright. but just why did you decide to pay me all this money? i'm sure it's not to keep George company in some glen. In every illegal operation there is a need for someone like George. ?ngela. Someone who has an ego so large, that he... succeeds because he can't really live with failure.. But inevitably two things occur.. first he decides to take over at some point. and second he runs up against a problem , he can't really handle. When any one of those two situations arises, I want you to be there. To set things straight. - I think I can manage that. - i'm sure you can. if you don't forget George is both heartless and... he has a clever grotesque turn of mind.. not to worry, Mr. Smith. The animal been sprayed over all with an infrared fluid. non-toxic fiuld, this will allow it to be tracked easily from the air.... with special lighting already installed on the helicopters.. Day and night. shine the light on him and he'll light up like a Christmas tree.. Good. What about electronic tracking. Oh, yes. We have microtransmitters between the hoof. and the shoe. four of them in all And is no way that four hoof transmitters is going to go on the frits. one maybe two, but not all four. fine. that's a strange kind of messenger, don't you think, Steve? I thought so until I saw the topographic map ... of the area around Alba, Nevada. The burro it is a perfect choice.. Here's the ransom, Steve. I really wish you're let us mark that cash, Steve. He's too clever not to do a thorough examination when he gets it.. No, if he finds some way to get his hands on the money... without us being right behind it, and if he discovers out that the money is marked he'll sell the lists and the codes to our adversaries . That means 39 dead or imprisoned agents. its too big of a risk. You were tied up in conference, so I authorized the bags to be fitted with tear gas elements... No, departure from routine. I'm sure Abner Smith knows our.... procedure almost as well as we do.. How do they activate? usual way, a sharp blow on either bag. Routine. i think we're being watched. "Un poco m?s r?pido, por favor". let's get out of here. the hoof transmitters are all go, Steve. Good. what now. Wait. Something has gone wrong, Steve. we are not getting any signals from the hoof transmitters. we better get chopters in here to make visual contact.. no need. We already have that tooken care of why don't we just pick a comfortable spot where we can wait for the burro and relax? George, You Don't want to relax. Now Why would you say that? - Pick a Target. - You Pick it. That Stump over there. How Much? Name Your Own Price. for hitting that Stump, George. Oh! Fifty. You're on. Alright. now hit the javelin, you just threw - Double or Nothing. - You're on. that burro should be here any time now. There it is. There's someone riding it. i got five big ones that saids you can't take her off from here. this isn't the way i expected to see you again , ?ngela. what other way could there be now, Diana. Must we make war against each other? We have no choice. We both know your Goals. and mine. The last time we was in contest together there was no victor. I remember. George, Take the burro and leave. and i advise you to do as you was instructed. This is beautiful. You would not take my life. I did not save your life on the island to take it now. - Would you allow me to replace my weapon? - No, Angela. no more fighting between us. There is no hope that i will ever return to the island . i made my choice. i want the things this world has to offer. we was so much alike. Never. Then our sisterhood ends here. Not until I repay my debt I owe you my life. Set your price. I pay it. That was in our childhood. i won't be indebted to you ,Diana. Set your price. Where are they taking the money? The mushroom shaped rock. on the north end of the great canyon. your debt is paided. - Oh, tell Mr. Smith... - i will explain. You know as well as i do we will face each other again. and if i win... i will take your life. Where is ?ngela, George? Still at the Glen. Guess who turned up riding the burro? she does have her style? a style all her own. open the pouchs, George. should i check it for markings? Trevor wouldn't risk marking it. 2 million is all mine. would you like it to be 3 million, George. i'll make you a wager for a million. What is it? That she followed you here. you're kidding. even if ?ngela lost the fight and told her where to come, she's on foot, . Well then you can't lose. I don't think so. You just costed me 1 million dollars. you're gonna regret it. I guess the honeymoon is over, George. You won the bet. i've looked forward to meeting you for a very long time. as i've looked forward to meeting you, Mr. Smith. you are exactly as I pictured you. exactly. your taller then i expected. ?ngela asked me to extend her apologies. im sure she did her best to get here. you've had a very long and dry trip. for your peace of mind. thank you. we have to kill her. Oh I certainly hope not, George. She not just gonna let us walk away with that money. she might. and what if she doesn't? there is time to decide that then isn't there? not if she told Steve Trevor? where she is. if you took the time to study your adversaries ... you know she didn't. Then you probably be in business for yourself instead of working for me. Now will you see if the copter is fueled, George. You found what has to be the most unlikely place to live in the entire country, Mr. Smith. inside the north wall of the grand canyon. i would thank you, but i had nothing to do with making it what it is. I'm sure you realize that we have something of a problem to solve. yes, a problem. Before we confront that. will you answer a question for me. if i can. That burro. we scrubbed off the ultraviolet spray. deactivated the signal transmitters . visually create confusion using three identical, identical Burros.. and yet you still followed it. How? Tracks, Mr. Smith. you see hoofprints is almost like fingerprints. the almost basic and simple facts Are the ones we overlook. Tracks. of course Tracks. i have another question. Do you mind? That depends on the question. i left Cap D'Antibes a full hour or more , Before you had. and you was in New York ahead of me. How? I have this Marvelous plane. That flies that much faster than yours.. i'd like to see it sometime. i'm afraid that's just not possible. even if i give you my word. i'd make no attempt to steal it it's not that. you see my plane is invisible. and you are invisible when you fly it. - of course. - of course. Convenient. Now... let's get back to our problem. We have 15 million dollars in these pouches. And I have ten books that which as soon as the ransom is paided.. i intend to return to your goverment. That should insure your mind that your agents will be safe. The books are in this leather case. I propose to leave here with the money by helicopter. Leaving the books with you. That seems fair. If this was a normal business transaction. Mr. Smith, it would be.. But you don't think it is. You violated the law. And there are the basic morality, of right and wrong. to which you here. of which I dedicated my life Mr. Smith. Abner? Oh, Please. Abner. consider ... there is no way for you to leave here. No way for you to stop me from leaving. common sense would seem to indicate you to need re evaluate your position. - May i show you around. - i would like that. Good, this way Please. It's an elevator system of the most advanced engineering. I stole the plans for it from Strategic Air Command. brilliant people there. I will tell them that you appreciate their talents. I hope you will have the opportunity. May i look? if you give me your word your word, that you won't try to sabotage it. i'll have to pass. Have you read all these books? Something more then half. And this is where you plan the robbery. That is a very interesting story. I was in Lisbon. where i bought some information or something or another. you were wearing two bracelets when you arrived... now there is only one. Where is the other? Now put those saddle bags. and that box on the floor. get them, Joey. - No, leave that. - Why? We can sell them again. because we made a deal, George. and our word has to be good. Why the gun, George? - We got to kill her. - No no no no. Killing people makes other people much more angry we got the money. Makes them furious. we don't need that. and we may want to do business with them again. I sincerely wish that we might have spend more time together. well, It has been a pleasure doing business with you. I look forward to our next enterprise together. i take it you are the one, who sees to the burro. yes Sir. the people you are leaving it with has children? - Four. - oh that's fine. perhaps it's better you start out now. you see to it paying Cass, Joe and the others, George. And then join me, all right? - Right. Thank you again. Well, what about a parting drink. no thanks, George. We were there the last time, you offered anybody a parting drink. Why, George? Money. Salute. you want all the money, George? 15 million dollars, Mr. Smith. Why not? just give me the saddle bags. You find a way to be broke in a year, George. Abner . - can't swim, really, George? i am so sorry. You came close, Abner. i need a light. Thank you. you're welcome. Lets go, buddy. Wonder Woman. i love you. And after we're done we get to the so called... we have to check the personal evaluations. And don't forget to call maintenance about the air conditioning here. There's a conference at 11 with the head department. Right. See if you can move that to another day. - That is all. - let's start with the call to London. Yes, sir. Oh, Dee. You didn't tell me. When you finally caught up with him. how was the bout with your dentist. Painful, a little.
