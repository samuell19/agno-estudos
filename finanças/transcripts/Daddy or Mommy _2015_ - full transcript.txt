Its good! - What does it mean? - Mom told me to live with you. You said that? - I ... - Yes! Dad told me you were going to kill yourself. You said that? Huh? No! Non. Yes, you said it. No divorce. We chose: we want you to stay together. Wait 10 years. Yes, it flies at your age. Are you happy? You lost? We lost! If you want, we lost! They must choose, it's not complicated! Yes, they overdo it. How do we do? What do we do? You do what you want, I'm going to the hospital. You there are going now? - I'm on duty. - Yes? You'r changing clothes? Stay naked, it's faster. With her, I take my time.

I rinsed after. - You poisoned them? - Not on purpose. All so they choose me? - Are you kidding me. - Take me for a fool. - For a moment I was ... - You're sick, my poor girl! "You" make me sick. You'll heal. - I don't want to see your face. - Really? - Tired of seeing your face. - Are you? - I can't anymore! - That's good! - Me too! - Well that's it! We're both fed up, good. With the children, we will do one day for you, one day for me. - Very well! - That's perfect! You start! And now! - Why me? - I said it first. I don't care! Goodbye! Good night! Happy New Year! - It's okay? - Yeah. Come. We'll leave you. OK. Where are the children? With Henry. I wanted us to speak on neutral ground. OK. Go on, I'm listening. Well, we screwed up. Besides, I screwed up, so you screwed up too, that's it... And I think we can stop. We have to behave normally, as adults. So it's up to you. What do you mean? As usual! You decide when we argue, when reconciled, when we need to become adults. Vincent... I'm not under your command, as your workers. Rebellion? Your slut gives you wings? Slut! That's not you, so vulgar. It'm not the one fucking the nurse! I'm not leaving for her, I'm leaving because of you. I go to Denmark. Wait, the children choose. - You want war? - It's you. - Ah, that's for sure! - So you want war. - You will have it! - But I'm ready! How tall are you? I am ready. You're going to have it, war! OKAY! I should hope so. Bye. What are you doing here? I'm having a walk. I took the day off. I don't care! I also want to get the kids. You are going to do what? I dunno, I still hesitate. Bye-bye!

I was in a hotel in Dubai. There, a dwarf took me into a corridor. And then an old woman pushes me. I fall on my back, and there she sits astride me. And in fact, rapes me somehow. And then I realize it's your mother. But I... Relax, it's okay. No, it's not okay! I'm not fine! I Divorce, it's war with the kids, I'm old. - No, you're beautiful! - Oh yeah!

At strip club, don't exaggerate. You broke my son's arm. You've broken your daughter's my heart. - How far do we go? - It depends on your motivation. I'm going to win. I hear like a doubt in your voice? You got a start, I saw a spark in your eyes, for sure, but ... You're fragile. Fragile? You need to reassure yourself. - reassure me about what? - Your manhood. What's wrong with my manhood? Give up, Vincent. In your dreams! - I'll hurt you. - Yes? Yeah. Good. Feel pain? There were some left. Sorry, I don't like to waste. Oh damn. - File a complaint. - No, I need to find something. - I hurt you? - Yes. - Show me. - I have a medicine which heals everything. It's not the moment. You piss me off, actually. Sweetheart. Sorry? "Sweetheart"? Because you invited me twice at the cafeteria, you can call me "sweetheart"? Well, Marion, then. You can't buy me with food. Alright, bye! Oh it's... Flo... Oh! Marion! Hi, Vincent. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Yes with pleasure. Good evening, Gisele! You take her out every weekend? Yes. The retirement home is not really joyful. - Is she doing better? - Alzheimer's, rarely does better. You stay here all you want, but if you leave the marital home, - you'll lose custody. - You think? I am sure. We will not stay at 40,000 watts. Remind Dionnet to do his job! You look fit. Great, Vincent left. - No? - He's not gonna come back. - Happy for you. - Thank you. The judge will slay him: abandonment of the home, he can forget about shared custody.
