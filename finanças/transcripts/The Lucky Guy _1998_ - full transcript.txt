Skip the sugar for the mixed milk tea and coffee! Two eggs for the breakfast. Hurry up. Move aside! Freshly baked egg tarts! Please give way! Excuse me! I want two! Freshly baked egg tarts! Can you repeat one more time? Man, I've repeated myself many times already! Chiu, good morning! Two tarts, iced milk tea, and the macaroni to go. As usual! - Mr Li, you're really something! - Of course! - I'm really sorry. He's new here. - Boss, I want to order something. Morning, Fun! - Buying breakfast for grandpa? - Yes, the usual. Okay, please wait. Fai, take the order! Condensed milk on the tart. Spring onion fried egg with toast. Mixed milk tea and coffee. Skip the sugar. Why is he so fussy with his breakfast? That's not being fussy. That's just his character. Our neighbours are our business. We have to remember their preferences. Or else we cannot compete with the fast food restaurants. Don't just stand here. Take the orders at once! Do it! Morning, Kei! Morning, Nam! You pulled an all-nighter again? - A last-minute job. - Hey! You're eating this again? If your dad sees this... What is there to see? You brat! You're my son, yet not only do you not help out with the business... you're now buying from our competitor! What's the big deal? it's just a hamburger. Can't you eat our own egg tarts? I've eaten those for over twenty years! You're my son, and it's bad if the neighbours see you eat this! Of all the things available, you have to eat fast food! I hate fast food! They lack originality and variety! Okay, I'll arrive in five minutes. - Fook! Fook! He's not back yet. - Not yet? Who will do the delivery? It's only two blocks away, and he's been gone for an hour. He must be helping others again. He's really too kind-hearted. Do your best! This way... Reverse the wheel... Slowly... A little further... Done! - Thanks a lot! - Okay! - Let me open the door for you! - Oh, thanks a lot! Bye-bye! Hey, are you all right? - Thanks! - You're welcome. I'm sorry I bumped into you. No, it's me who should apologise. You're wet all over. It's okay... Your milk. Luckily, it's still dry. It's empty. I was about to throw it away. Really? I'll throw it for you then. - You work at Lucky? - Right... our egg tarts are famous! Whenever you feel hungry... just call me up and I'll deliver right away. - So you do deliveries. - That's right. I work nearby. This is my business card. I'm in a hurry. I have to go. - Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! You're really kind! - Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! What would you like? Is Sui back yet? I'm new here. I don't know who he is. - Then I'll wait until Sui is back. - Okay. That would be $25.50. Please give this to Sui. Sui, right? Okay. - Hey, it's for Sui! - For Sui again? Okay. It's for Sui! Who is Sui? He's really amazing! You haven't heard of Sui? You must be new here. That's understandable. Sui has dated countless chicks. All men hate him for it. About those charming eyes of his. No matter how cold a woman may be... she would be enchanted by his soft and gentle stare. The neighbours recognised him as the love machine. He's the soul of this diner. Everyone calls him the Prince of Egg Tarts! - May, what's the matter with you? - Go away! What have I done wrong? You haven't done anything wrong. You're very good to me. But I don't love you anymore. We don't share the same feelings for each other. Feelings? I can change to suit you. To heck with that! One is AM and the other is FM. We're from two different channels! - I can move to your channel! - To heck with you! It's over for us! May! Prince of Egg Tarts... your taste for women is really bad! She's hot! Sui! Sui, I bought you a new car. Why did you buy me a car? It's not enough? I'll give you my flat as well. As long as you're happy. So you think I'll be happy when you give me your car and flat. What's wrong? I'm doing this out of love. You think you can be materialistic when it comes to love? No, Sui, you misunderstood me. People like you disgust me! - No, Sui, I'm sorry... - Get lost! No, Sui! Don't treat me like this. I can't live without you, Sui! - You won't leave, right? - No, I won't... I'll leave then! No! Sui! How come? He only enjoys the process of charming girls. He only wants to capture that surreal feeling. Whether he could get the girl or not is irrelevant to him. This is the highest state of getting chicks. Sui, you're really great! - Were there tears? - Yes... Thanks. - What do you want? - For the birds. - And you? - I switched on the fan. I didn't ask for the fan! But you requested to have newspapers flying around you. How could we do that without the fan? Thanks a lot. Let's split. "Are you feeling better? Remember to take the medicine." "Chibi Maruko-chan: Tomorrow at ten o'clock." Chibi Maruko-chan! - Hi! - Don't come near me! I've waited for this for a long time. Shin-chan, I finally get to see you! Shin-chan! - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Let's go over there. I'm sorry. The loan sharks were after me. It's okay. I'm being chased as well. By a loan shark too? Someone worse than a loan shark. - It's dangerous here. Let's go. - Sure. Thank you. Telephone! I'll get it... What's the matter? Two milk tarts. Okay, they will arrive in five minutes. - Is this about girls? - No. What are you doing? Boss... what's your opinion on love at first sight? What's your opinion then? Love at first sight is vague. It's like looking at the eggs with our glasses while the water is boiling... and the steam comes up and blocks our vision. We can barely see the eggs rolling around. When the eggs are almost done, we take away the glasses... and see that the eggs are cooked. We also see some of the egg whites floating about. It's a symbol of life. - What are you talking about? - Hey, I don't understand at all. He means it's like watching censored porn. The mosaic disappears suddenly, and you get to see the action clearly. - Oh. - Oh, now I see! I can tell you've never dated a girl before. You can't even express yourself properly. - You're trying to date a girl? - No. - Hey, waiter! - Yes. - Boss... - What now? - What was your first love like? - My first love? It was over thirty years ago. I was still a high school student. I would think of her all the time. Sometimes while I was peeing, I would stop in the middle of it... and think of her. I would feel the sweetness... and then I would forget to finish peeing. That's right... No wonder I had trouble peeing today. - Fook, are you trying to date a girl? - No. - Boss... - What is it? I'm only good at cooking. If I cook for her, do you think she'll be moved? Don't do it! Girls nowadays hate domesticated men! Fook, why are you sitting there and not working? Prince of Egg Tarts... They're talking about first love. What was yours like? I'm a wanderer. I've had no first love. That's right. You're great. Sui, if I want to win the heart of a girl, what should I do? Is there such a thing? Okay. Let me tell you this. Only one thing counts when it comes to dating girls. Handsome. Handsome? So I don't have a problem at all! None whatsoever! The problem lies with your folks. They gave you such an ugly face. Sui, what should I do then? It's okay if you're not handsome, as long as you have money. But I don't have any money. What then? I did have some, but I gave it all to you just now. Your bracelet is nice. You just bought it? If you're both ugly and poor, then you have to hit her with hobbies. What is she like? It's this one. That should be simple. Sui, I'm full of confidence now! Fook, the Kung Fu studio called for delivery! Sui, what should I do now? Do I look okay? You look pretty good today. Yeah, not bad. You look very smart today! - Are you ready? - Yes, I am! Then go get her! - Delivery has arrived! - How much? $48.50. - Here's fifty. Keep the change. - Thanks. Here are the egg tarts. Let go! I've paid you already! Hey! - Fook, you're here. - Yes! You look so different today. That's right... you also noticed it? Actually, this is the real me. I'm really manly. I'm not girly at all. Not bad... Try our egg tarts. They're really good. Okay. How come all the egg tarts are smashed? Morning, Manager. He's the trouble maker! I saw that! It's all a misunderstanding! Fanny, you better stay out of this. From your appearance, I can tell you're a martial artist. Let's settle this the martial arts way! - What do you mean, Manager? - This is what I mean! Say something! Come on! Are you a man? You're such a wimp! Okay, I'll give you a chance. Pick one among us to duke it out! - Choose me... - Do it... You dare to fight me? I'll choose the shorty who's sweeping the floor! Just let us deal with him! You've retired for so long! There's no need for you to break the rules, Master! Master? Get lost! Kid, you're so young, yet you dare to challenge our school! Although I haven't fought for two years... I must have a good fight with you today! Tell me your name! Fook from Lucky Diner. I'm Ng Lau Sau, the Master of King Thunder Fist! Get ready! Why didn't you fight back? You told me to get ready, but you didn't tell me to fight back. We're done, right? Fanny, the reason I came here today... Fook, are you okay? Luckily I saw he was not reacting... so I withheld ninety percent of my strength. Otherwise, he would have died. Get back to your practice... You shouldn't have fought if you didn't know how. I thought you would like it. Why would I? I hate violence. Then why do you work here? I work as a secretary here! Who else do you think I am? You're dressed like this. - What are you up to? - Nothing... Actually, I was wondering, if you're free... and you're all alone at home feeling bored... and you want to go out and need company... You want to ask me out, right? "You've got mail!" So this is how you met Chibi Maruko-chan! - Shin-chan, you're such a love bird! - Don't tease me. - You can just call me Nam. - Nam. - Right, you are... - I am Fon-Fon! But you can also call me Chibi Maruko-chan. Didn't you want to make a call? Right. I'll leave after making the call. I'm hungry. Let's cook something. No need. I'll get some food from downstairs. Okay. I'll leave after eating. Please don't touch Chibi Maruko-chan again. - Who are you? - Who are you? I'm asking who you are! You are in my home and eating my chips! You're Nam's father? That's right. Who are you? I'm Nam's fiancee. I'm Fon-Fon. Fiancee? What fiancee? He never told me about it! Does he consider me his father? - Dad... - Hold it! I won't accept this marriage! It is a serious matter! Why didn't he tell me about it? What we had earlier was just a small disagreement! About that argument, he realised he was wrong. He's really sorry about it. Of course he's wrong! You are both adults. It's difficult for him to apologise to you. He kept telling me that he had made you mad... and he felt really sorry. He actually cried when he told me that. Really? He dared not tell you on the day when we got engaged. He said he would give you the two surprises after you calm down. - Two surprises? - We bought a flat for you. But Nam doesn't want to let you know yet. How come he had the money? We didn't have the money, so we had to save up. We didn't even waste money to buy fish-balls from hawkers. Also, every day after the market closed... we went to pick up the leftover vegetables for dinner. I haven't eaten such expensive chips for a year. These chips are dirty. Don't eat them... I'll open another packet for you. - Dad, don't be upset with Nam. - No, I won't. - Blame me if you want. - No, you're both good kids. I won't be upset with the two of you. Dad, what are you doing? Nam! Nam! Why didn't you tell me about your marriage? Marriage? I've wronged you. You're a good son. I'm really happy today! I know how to take care of myself. Take this for the time being. Let me know if you need more. Fon-Fon, you must live with us! Okay. I'll move away once the decoration is done at my place. - I won't bother you for long. - We're family. You can stay here for however long you like. Thank you, Dad. This stuff is bad for your health. I'll cook something good for you, daughter-in-law. Thanks, father-in-law! - Thank you! - Daughter-in-law? You said you would leave after making the call. How did you become my wife? And you'll also be staying here? - What did you tell him? - Don't be so petty! I'm doing this because I have to hide from the loan sharks. Look how well I've pampered your father. He gave you so much money because of it. Please leave at once. - You want me to leave? - Yes, right away! You didn't even thank me, and now you're kicking me out? Say no more. Leave! You don't care that I'll be killed by the loan sharks? I'll leave now. I'll die in front of you! I'll get myself killed in front of you! Sorry... I didn't mean it. Consider it my fault. So you know you're wrong! I thought you would hang me out to dry! I'm warning you. You may spend the night here... but you must leave first thing in the morning tomorrow. Shin-chan, I know you care about me. You're a really nice guy. - It's so cute! - Don't touch it! Hello? Yes, Chief! Nothing much. I had a small problem yesterday. But everything is fine now. Okay... I'll be back right away... Morning, Shin-chan! What are you all doing here? Come and dance with us. It's good for health. - Dance for health? - That's right! You must keep on dancing! The monk I met in the Sahara Desert told me that... if you dance like this for a month... women will become prettier, and men will be more vigorous. Who is working in the diner when everyone is up here? The boss said it's good for us. So he's holding the fort. He'll pop in later on. Don't stop! Why don't you dance with us? Can you please stop fooling around? Well, they have such big bellies... so I'm teaching them this exercise. It will do them good. That's it. I'm sorry. I don't want to listen to your lies anymore. Leave here at once. What's the matter? Go and help with the work! Let's go... Do you want to see the loan sharks kill me? Enough with the nonsense. Please let me stay, Shin-chan! Don't call me Shin-chan again! Where are you going? Dad, I have to leave now. - He wants me to leave. - Where to? I asked her to go downstairs to help with the work. How can a girl handle such hard labour? That's right! I wanted to sleep in... but Nam said I have to be good to you. Right? It's good enough that you have that in mind. Don't mind me. Young men should have their own career. I can't let you become a waiter. I know... Here. I made this soup for you last night. Finish it. Thanks, Dad. It's bad to eat leftover vegetables. What are you talking about? - Leftover vegetables? - Have some. It's hot. Be careful. This is bad, we may be forced to close down our diner! What's the matter? The rent will be increased by twenty times! That's right. I signed the lease with Flirty Si ten years ago. It will expire next month. I'd forgotten about it. This is really bad. Does that mean we'll be out of work? The Lunar New Year is coming soon. Think of something! Go reason with her! - Can't you just beg her? - Go and try! It's impossible. Flirty Si is known to be a difficult woman. Unless she's your woman. Sui, when it comes to women, you're the expert! - Come up with something, Sui! - Do help us out! Come on! Since it's about the survival of this diner, I'll help. Who is the target? She's in charge of Shing Sai Real Estate. She's also our landlady. Her nickname is Flirty Si. - Her real name? - Flirty Si. - How old is she? - Thirty-six. That means she was born in the Year of the Tiger. She's at the age when she's ravenous for sex. What does she look like? She's like the fourth day of the New Year. What? The fourth day of the New Year? Sui's face has paled. On the fourth day of New Year, the holiday is over and you're broke. You have to get back to work. How could you look good? - Is there an abacus here? - Yes! If I'm not mistaken, she's an Aquarius. An Aquarius is cold on the outside, but warm on the inside. Just like this vase here. The area around the neck is narrow. But if you have the ability... to shove it in, you'll find a huge jungle. You can even tumble in there. Let me tell you this. To deal with this kind of woman, you must have a powerful gaze... along with a strong arm... so as to rescue her from the sea of lust! Bravo...! Sui, we're counting on you. We'll be saved. We'll... She's here! A strong arm. A powerful gaze. Are you all right? To heck with you! You dirty beggar! Bloody fool! Idiot! Buzz off! Please consider... You want to threaten me? I'll increase the rent for sure. Move if you don't have the money! I'll shut down this place at noon in two weeks! The woman who bit you is infected with rabies. You're kidding, right? She was bitten by a dog? A dog bite is not the only channel of transmission. If she had kissed an infected dog, she would be infected as well. Then I'm in trouble. Very much so. Just to play it safe... I advise you to consider the Rabies Package. It is a "Forty-Nine Injections Therapy" that takes seven weeks to complete. After this, you don't have to be afraid of dog bites anymore. That means seven shots a week. No... It's seven shots a day. Forty-nine shots a week. 343 shots in seven weeks. If one of the shots is not administered properly... you have to start all over again. More than 300 injections! He's out of his fat mind! - Hurry up... - We're already going very fast! Sit tight. The train has arrived. Sit down. When can we do it again? You want to do it again? Take the medicine, and we'll have another go at it. Take this medicine. Mister, you look familiar. Do we know each other? You're mistaken. But your voice sounds really familiar. Can you say a few more words? I'm sorry. I'm seeing a doctor. I'm in a hurry. - Ho Kum Sui! - I'm not Ho Kum Sui! Ho Kum Sui, you're here to see the doctor? Don't you have to work at the diner today? I have to go now. Bye-bye! Ho Kum Sui! You can tell I work in an office in Central. Diner? She's just making things up! Mister, you have dropped your ID card. - Ho Kum Sui, right? - I didn't drop it. But this photo looks exactly like you. Can't we look alike? No, I saw you dropped it. Can it not be a mistake? I swear, if it's a mistake, all my organs will be messed up... my new-borns will be deformed, and I'll die this very instant! Since you put it that way, I may have dropped it after all. It's yours. Don't bother denying it. I knew you were Ho Kum Sui! Don't you recognise me? I'm Yip Yuk Fan, Candy! You still like to fool people after all these years. Let's meet next time. Don't go yet. Do you remember that incident back in high school? You tore my dress, and I've yet to settle the score with you. That incident... About that, I'm really sorry. Sorry won't do. I won't accept it. You're much prettier now. Enough with the nonsense. Pay up! What? You think you don't have to pay for the dress? Are you going to pay up? I'll call the police if you don't. There's no need for that. I'll pay. We're classmates after all. - That's it. - Here you go. Calling the police? Give me the change. Don't mess with me, punk! What? Do you think I'm an idiot? What do you want? Go away! Watch it or I'll get my men to come after you. - There's still something missing. - What? A knife. Darn it! I didn't even scare you! You were half way there. I was a little nervous back there. It's all your fault. You tore my dress. Let's forget it. It happened ages ago. I won't bear a grudge. I'm really relieved! Don't worry, I have to work now. Bye! This is my business card. Call me when you have time. I'm happy to see you again. It stirs up a lot of old memories. Bye! Doctor, it's merely 300 injections. I'll do it! - I'm very happy today. - Me too. I didn't expect our relationship to progress this fast. This is my first time with a girl. I don't believe you. How could that be? You're a man. It's true... I'm not lying. You're really my first. Rest for five more minutes and you can leave. This is really weird. A kind man like you should have donated blood many times. It's because of Sui. He's terrified of injections. That's why I thought giving blood would hurt a lot too. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have come here. Who is Sui? Sui is a very nice guy. We call him the Wanderer, but he doesn't mind at all. We even nicknamed him the Prince of Egg Tarts. - The Prince of Egg Tarts? - Look at this egg tart. The outside looks cold and hard. But it's actually soft and sweet inside. This name suits him perfectly! - Is there really such a guy? - Have an egg tart. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Sui and I are best friends in the diner. We've talked for so long, yet you're still talking about him. Why don't you tell me something about yourself? About myself? Actually, I'm a boring guy. I have no hobbies. I don't talk much. Since you work in the diner, you must like cooking. Cooking? Not my cup of tea. I hate cooking. Don't expect me to ever cook. I'm not the domestic type. I thought you were one based on your demeanour. We can't tell from appearance. Sui is a good example He looks like an idiot... but he can make you laugh to tears! He can really make you laugh your head off! That's why Sui attracts lots of girls. I hope he'll find his real love soon. You do care about your friends. I'm happy when I see that they're happy. What about me? Are you happy when you see me? Of course. I'm not just happy. I'm actually elated. I took this packet of biscuits from the Red Cross. I'll keep it forever to commemorate our first time. Oh no, I ate mine! I don't have anything to commemorate with. I'll give you mine. - No, it's yours. - No, take it. - No, take it back. - No, it's from me to you. - No - Come on! I'm sorry... It's hot! Don't panic... - You feel better now? - I'm drenched! I'll dry it for you! That girl's really stupid. She said Li Chi is the capital of Brazil. Give me a break! Such a stupid woman deserves to be dumped by you. Right. Anyone with the slightest geographical knowledge knows... even if Li Chi had bigger breasts, she would not be Brazil's capital! What's so funny? What's funnier than talking about girls? Since we're on the subject... Fanny and I went out today. It's really funny. Really? If not, we want a refund. You'll probably die from laughter! Fanny and I had a candlelit dinner. The moment when we really got into the mood... I accidentally poured the chicken cream soup on her. It's bad! You must have soaked her dress. Not only that. The soup was hot. It really burnt her thighs! What then? I tried to help her with the table cloth. When I pulled the table cloth the candle fell on her. It was really bad! That candle must have burnt her dress. You were not listening to me. Her dress was soaked. How could it be burnt? The candle burnt her shoes! That was bad! - What happened next? - Then I stood up, and... I kept on stomping at her feet! I stomped so hard that... I heard her bones crack! Was she able to walk back home? She probably could. When I saw her home, she told me... "I don't want to see you again. You're not my type." At that moment it felt like someone pulled a knife on me... carved out my heart... and threw it into an abyss. It's a real deep abyss, and the heart just kept on falling. I had no idea when it would stop. It felt like a woman giving birth to a baby. It really hurt! Actually, it still hurts! The pain just won't stop! That's really amusing. It's late. Let's go. Let's clean up and leave. It's not that amusing. Don't laugh if it's not amusing. Sui, what should I do now? You must rely on yourself in this kind of situation. How? Come on, we're buddies. What else can you do? Go and talk to her. I don't know what to say. Just the same. You must rely on yourself. No one can help you. Trust me. You can do it. Don't be like this. Go get some beer. I don't want to use alcohol to numb myself. I know. I want you to get the beer for me. - It's for rabies. - Just a safety measure. Didn't I give you my telephone number last time? You did. Roll up your sleeve. So why didn't you call me? Stop talking. It may hurt a bit. - Really? Then be gentle on me. - Sure. Here we go. Hey, are you all right? It does hurt a bit. So are you ready then? - Ready for what? - It'll hurt more when I pull it out. Really? Do be gentle then. Okay. Candy, is there a chance for us to have dinner? Why? Because I have some medical questions to ask you. Save it. You find me pretty and you want to date me, right? Tomorrow at eight. We'll have dinner after I get off work. Boss, time for dinner. Look, in last year's batch, there were three chicks. Over the years, at least forty chicks have come out of this nest. So what's your point? I have an idea! All of you have been working here for many years. Let me tell you, it's very troublesome this time. But don't worry, I finally have a solution to our problem! - It's not a salary cut, right? - No. I'm closing Lucky down soon. - Close down Lucky? - That's right! Lucky does have business. It's just that we're not making much money. A penny here, a penny there. It's not much. Just look at our best-selling egg tarts. How many do we sell per day? - About 900. - Let's say it's 1000. That's only $3000. So my conclusion is that our business cannot be carried on. - Am I right? - You're right... Right, so there's only one way out. Let's turn the diner into Lucky Hot Pot Seafood Restaurant! Hot pot and seafood? Isn't it catchy? The profit margin is high when it comes to seafood. If someone orders a steamed fish, the profit is no less than 1,000. I'll also add in hot pot. I only have to buy the ingredients... and the customers will do the cooking themselves. I'll get a large cut out of it. Isn't it a good idea? - Pretty good... - Will it work, Sui? It's a very good idea! A light struck my head and I came up with this right away! That light was really something! That's why I'm in luck! To heck with her! I won't give a darn even if she jacks up the rent by 100,000! This place has good feng shui. If the feng shui was bad here, there wouldn't be a bird nest at all. If we work hard together, we can win this battle! - Good, boss! - We'll win this battle! Sui, will you join us? Let's do her in! - Kei, will you join? - Let's do her in! - Let's do her in! Let's do her in! - Let's do her in! Let's do her in! Who would that be? We must fight for the seafood hot pot restaurant! Seafood hot pot! Okay! I have many buddies who are in the renovation business. I'll ask them to renovate this place and charge less for it! - I have thought of something. - What is it? I know where we can get cheap tools for hot pot. Where? The hot pot restaurant right across from here. They closed up shop not even a month after their grand opening. Their tools are new. Their bowls are cheap. - Just the right moment! - Let's get their tables and chairs! - The tools are new and cheap... - We can have their chopsticks... - They just closed up shop? - That's right. Seafood hot pot? Let me think again. There's a solution to everything. - Boss, you're not eating? - I have to pee first. These photos are worthless! Chief, these bird shops will close down soon. This is our only chance to shoot them. It's not my concern! All I want is hype! The police station has given me an exclusive. Real estate businessman... Law Chat Fai's daughter is missing. If we have photos of her running off with a man... or photos of her being sold to the brothels... then we'll make a fortune! Go take care of it. You got me again! You lost. Drink up! I'm done with your riddles. Let's do finger guessing. No way, it's a man's game. - I don't like it. Just drink up! - Okay! Wait, do you hear that? Sounds like the phone is ringing. Stop pretending. - You have no will to win! Drink up! - Okay... There's no way that I would lose every time. Give me another one. Okay, but you must answer this one swiftly. - Sure. Black! - What colour is a black cat? - A white cat? - White! A panda? I heard this before. Panda has two colours, and they're black and white. Drink up! I haven't finished yet. What about the dead cat stuck on the wall? It has no breath at all! Wrong! It's a decoration! It's a decoration! You tricked me again! Okay, I have one for you. Everyone is launching rockets... but how come none of them could shoot down a star? Because the stars are very high up in the sky. Wrong! Because they know how to blink in and out of a rocket's way! You're sly! You've tricked me this time! Come on! Ask me another question! Ask me the most difficult question! - Okay. - Okay. Lucky Diner has to close down next month... and the guys will be out of work. If you were me, what would you do? You don't know, right? There's no way out. - It's a matter of money. - But I have no money. Father-in-law, don't worry. My dad has lots of money. I'll lend you some. Your father owes the loan shark money. Perhaps I should lend him money instead. - You don't believe me? - I do! My family is rich. I'll get you the money! Okay. - Wait for me! - I'll wait for you. - Don't go. - I won't. This is my home. Silly girl. - She's gone? Where to? - She just left. Fon-Fon! Fon-Fon! Fon-Fon! Fon-Fon! Fon-Fon! Fon-Fon! Fanny, there's something I have to tell you. It has to be done in person. Let's meet in the park at noon. I won't leave until you arrive. I'm sorry... I'm a bit late. You're not angry, right? Not angry? You asked me to be here at noon, but now it's five. You're five hours late! Of course I'm mad! Fanny, please let me explain! Someone needed my help, that's why I am late. That shouldn't have taken you five hours. Well, this old lady was carrying lots of things. She didn't know which bus to take, so I took her to the bus station. Then you saw the old lady home, right? Right, but I didn't expect that when we arrived there... her daughter-in-law was about to go into labour. The old lady couldn't help... so I carried her daughter-in-law downstairs. When we got downstairs, her water had broke. It was dangerous. It's a matter of life and death, so I had to help them. What then? What happened to that woman? She's fine. When she arrived at the hospital, she didn't let go of me... until the baby was born. You were there when the baby was born? That's right. I could have left after that... but when the baby's father arrived at the hospital... he asked me to give the baby a name. As you know, I'm not well-educated. The only names I could suggest were Coffee, Tart, and Sandwich. I couldn't think of anything better. They didn't really like those. Then the old lady said... "If it weren't for you, the baby would have died." "Let's use your name." Fook? Yes. They liked the name a lot. - But I felt it wasn't right. - Why? I felt the baby should be called Fanny... because the baby was a girl. She's pale, fat and lovely. She's really cute. She's very sweet. Fanny would suit her very well. Why Fanny and not another name? Because Fanny is a good name. Also, I only know one girl's name and that's Fanny. I don't know any other name. What Chinese name did you give her? I made a direct translation and named her Fen Li. What do you think? No, Fen Li means separation. - It's a sad name. - I'll change it then. Did you ask me to wait for hours just to listen to your story? No, not at all. Actually, Fanny, I wanted to tell you... I... I really like you. What happened last time was an accident. Please forgive me. I hope we can be friends, and not separate anymore. Can I? Fanny... so what's your decision? Like I said, the English name is okay, but the Chinese name is bad. I'm not talking about the name. I'm talking about us. I meant separation is not good. Do you understand? - I do! - You idiot! - Aren't I cute? - Let's go! I want to visit the baby girl. Should I name her Sect? No... her surname is In. It's bad to call her Insect. That would not be right. What should we name her then? Who broke it? I'm sorry. I was curious and I broke it by accident. You're not angry, right? What do you think? Okay... I'll make you a better one. Just don't come out first, okay? Sorry. I was testing the saw just now and I was careless. You're not angry, right? No, why should I be angry? Fon-Fon is great. Her father is in the construction business... and she's pretty good at fixing up the house too. Can you remove the floor tiles? Be careful. I can't do it. They're stuck really tight. Let's forget about it. There's nothing we can do. You've done your best. You've dug a big hole here! What are you going to do about it? It's easy. It's all covered up now. Right. You're such an expert. Of course, but there's still a little crack here. It's easy. I have a spittoon here. You're right. This spittoon covers it perfectly. What? You have an exclusive on Law Chat Fai's daughter? We'll make a fortune if this is true. Just make it as sensational as possible. I'll reserve the cover of the next issue for you. "Rich girl got her hands dirty." "Rich girl got addicted to drugs." "Rich girl became a prostitute." Look, it's pretty. You're pretty good. Look, you're like a dirty pig. You're a dirty pig too. - Don't poke! - Okay. - For me? - Yes. Have a smoke first. Look. This Shin-chan is you. This Chibi Maruko-chan is me. Don't they look like us? You've a camera. Let's take a picture. Here's the delivery! Where's Fanny? A man came for her, and they went to the park together. A man? It's Fanny ex-boyfriend. He's tall and handsome. He's also a university student. I heard he came all the way from America to propose to her. - Propose to her? - That's right. I'm sorry, Miss. Here's your cup... - Fook! - You're crazy! She... You're lucky today. You get to see the real me. Actually... I'm the Prince of Egg Tarts! I'm Sui. I'm the guy that I told you about. It's you? Don't be deceived by my idiotic appearance. Many girls have been ruined by me. The school girl back there? You saw what happened. About our relationship... don't take it too seriously. I was just fooling around. You were messing with me? It's nothing serious. Just consider it a lesson in life. Next time, be more careful in your character judgment. Forget me. Don't ever remember me. - Do you need my help? - Sure, thanks. Further back... - I'll open the door for you. - Thank you. Hello? It's done. Right, you can have it anytime. Is it sensational enough? I think I can describe it as sly and shameless. I learnt it all from you! - Fon-Fon. - You're setting me up. What would everyone think of me? - Are you trying to do me in? - No, I'm not. - Where's your conscience? - I have my reasons. You are a shameless scumbag! I'll see if you are really that heartless! No! Shin-chan! Are you all right? What did you tear up? - Nothing. - Why are you so frightened? - Did I scare you? - No. I was too absorbed in my work. I didn't notice you came in. Time to eat. Let's go. Let's eat! Let's eat! - Need help? - No need... Nam, your office called. Someone will come to collect the photos. - What photos? - Really? Nothing... Right, I still don't know what you do for a living. - Don't you know Nam works... - It's okay, Dad! - Let's eat first. - Let's eat... - No need to open the door. - Why? - I'll open the door! - Hey, don't do it! - You are... - Mr Li! Sorry to bother you. My client here wants to see the flat. It's okay... feel free to look around. - Dad, you want to sell the flat? - Yes. I've thought about it. It's no use to keep the diner. I'm old. It's time for me to retire. But I can't just end the business and leave. Those guys have worked for me for a long time. I want to sell the flat to get some cash. Consider it their compensation or whatever. They need money to live on. You two can live in the flat that you bought. I'll rent a small room somewhere around here. The rent in this area is cheap. I've seen all kinds of things in my life. I don't ask for much. As long as you and Fon-Fon are happy, then I'll be happy. Fon-Fon. What's the matter? You don't feel well? I'm fine. Go see what's wrong with her. Fon-Fon. This is bad... I don't know how to tell your father that I lied to him. If he knew I had lied to him, he would be very sad. Don't worry. I'll tell him. It'll be fine. You didn't mean it, right? Actually, I'm the daughter of Law Chat Fai. Because no one cares about me at home, I always tell lies. That day, I left home after having an argument with my father. I just wanted to have some fun. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. You both treat me so well. I feel really bad about the whole thing. Stop laughing. Try to think of something. You're Chibi Maruko-chan. No one gets angry when Chibi Maruko-chan lies. You don't have to lie to me. I know I'll never be the Chibi Maruko-chan in your heart. Who said so? One is Shin-chan. The other is Chibi Maruko-chan. - This is for you. - Thanks. You've told me everything. Aren't you afraid I'll hurt you? Those who like Chibi Maruko-chan won't hurt others. Come on. Let's eat. Come on. Are the photos ready? Hurry up. We need them to go to press. So she's your girl now! No wonder you have exclusive access! Smart kid! You're a reporter? - Listen to me. - Go away! Fon-Fon, I... Sorry. Just a little more. Good. Actually, it's my first time here. Candy. I love you very much. I've been in love with you since the first day we met at school. I thought this love would disappear over time. But when I met you again in the hospital... my love for you just shot back up again. Perhaps "poured out" would be a better descriptive term? No, only "shot up" could truly describe how I feel. Candy, there's a letter that I've always wanted to give you. I never had the chance until now. - Candy! - I think you should know that... even if a girl agrees to have dinner with you... it doesn't mean that she will sleep with you. Of course, that is only allowed between a married couple. I won't make friends with those who have pre-marital sex. The problem is that I don't believe in that. If I knew I were in love with you... I wouldn't waste so much time on a romantic dinner... or engage in some romantic conversation. We would go to bed directly. Don't you agree? I totally agree with you. In this day and age, going directly to bed is the best approach. I have a suggestion. Have you ever worn women's underwear before? Women's underwear? Not only have I worn it before... I used to steal my grandma's underwear and wear it as a hat. Why don't you put on my panties tonight? I think you'll be very sexy. You want me to put on your panties? Can you? If I do that, what will you be wearing then? I'll do it. It's a deal then. Don't go back on your words. Let's do it now. - Now? We're in a restaurant. - See you in the toilet. Hey, I'm going to the toilet. Wait for me here. Why don't I serve it in five minutes? Five minutes? At least an hour. You think I'm not up for it? Hurry up. I want to see your skivvies. They're coming off now. - You can be even more sexier. - How? Remember not to tuck the shirt inside your skivvies next time. Sure, I'll go commando next time. Wait... hurry up and put my panties on now... or else the steak will become cold. It's all right. I've asked the waiter to serve it in an hour. You're really in a rush, aren't you? - Do you like it? - Sure, I do. I've always longed for this kind of feral experience. Not yet. Turn around. Me? Shouldn't you be the one to do that? I want to see the muscles on your back. Okay... You're very muscular. Do you always work out? Hey! Candy! Hey! What are you doing? I can finally have my revenge! - Revenge? - Don't you remember? You tore my dress at the party. I changed school, but I was called flat-chested for five years! That was a long time ago, are you still mad over it? Didn't you say you would not bear a grudge? Let's see if you're still angry with me in ten years, scumbag! Candy! Candy! "Cheater" Isn't that the Prince of Egg Tarts? Sui, what happened? How did you get into this? Don't worry. I've asked everyone not to go near the lamp post. That's right. It's not only the lamp post. They're everywhere. Darn it! Kei, get me one hundred men. Got it. Who are we going to beat up? I need them to tear down the posters! No need for that. Sui, I have a solution for you. - Get the men first. - No need. I do have a solution for you. - What is it? - Sit down first... - This will work. It'll be all right. - Have you gone outside? - This should do the trick! - This is it. We don't recognise you at all. - Does it work? - No one can recognise you. Just to be safe. - Fatty, do you recognise me? - Who the heck are you? - See? It works. - Thanks a lot. Don't mention it. You're the Prince of Egg Tarts. You're our spiritual support. Hang in there. We all depend on you. Don't worry! I'll hang in there! Last two days. I'm here to inform you that we'll be sealing your shop... at noon in two days. Don't worry. There's always a way out. Let's enjoy our last two days here! Yes! Excuse me, is Fook here? You came for Fook? There he is. Fook, someone's here for you. - You're Fook? - You? Please take good care of Fanny. I'm Fanny's ex-boyfriend. I wanted to get back together with her, but she refused me. She told me she's in love with you. I'll return to the States tomorrow. I hope you'll take good care of Fanny. Goodbye. Sui! Sui... you must help me this time. Only you can help me get out of this mess. You recognised me? No, I recognised the bracelet. You scared me. - Sui, here. - Okay, I'll help you! Fanny is here. Go and explain for me. Don't worry. I'll watch you from here. But you must go and explain to her yourself. Otherwise, you're not showing your sincerity. - Sincerity. - You must have sincerity! Sincerity. Fanny. Why do you still come here? Look at me. Look into my eyes. Actually, it was a misunderstanding. I thought you were getting back with your ex-boyfriend. I couldn't deal with it, so I lied to you. I'm not the Prince of Egg Tarts. Everything I did was out of love. I hope you can forgive me. Fanny, can you feel my sincerity? I can sense it completely. I have never seen such sincerity. Really? Fanny... Please step aside. Fanny, I feel uneasy when you stare at me like this. What do you want? Please step aside. I'm not staring at you. These eyes convey a sense of sincerity and perversion. They're also innocent, yet beguiling. This is so confusing. I lent him the bag for fun. Fanny, this is my buddy, the Prince of Egg Tarts. Sui, this is my first love, Fanny. - You're the Prince of Egg Tarts? - You're Fanny? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Sui is here today to help me explain things to you. That's right. Fook really likes you. He's a real nice guy. Say no more! I don't want to listen to any of this! Fanny, don't be like this. Don't worry. I'm here. Take it easy. Don't worry... Fanny, listen to me. Are you free tonight? - Yes, what do you want? - I... Sui! Sui! The Prince of Egg Tarts is a name without substance. - I know. - Just like you... I'm a poor guy who fails to get girls. You should understand this feeling. I do. Love is really magical. Don't you agree? I do. It was love at first sight when I saw your girl Fanny. Didn't you see? I did. Then shouldn't we pop the champagne? Shouldn't we? It's all because of you, Fook! You're my buddy! Buddy... Fanny, I have many things to tell you. - Me too - Let's go. But it's too sudden. I can't accept it yet. Besides, Fook looks miserable. How can I? Fanny, what's the matter? I really... Don't force me. I hope you understand. - Are you for real? - I'm serious. You scumbag! I almost popped the champagne for you. That's my first love! You snatched her away from me! You scum! Yes. I wanted to snatch her from you, but I failed. Fanny still loves you. And I'm still a poor guy who fails to get girls. Sui. Don't be like this, Sui. I'm fine. Come here. What happened was just a misunderstanding. You're the perfect couple. I'll disappear from your life. Sui, don't be like this. We can always be friends. There's no going back now. But before I leave, I must tell you... I'll never forget the two minutes that I spent with you. I'm deeply in love with you. Fook... Sui, you came to see me! I thought you would never care about me anymore. Don't be silly. We're buddies. I'm glad that you're fine. - Sui. - Just be there tomorrow. - Where? - Fanny and I are getting married. No, Sui, don't... Calm down. - It's fine now. - What happened to me? You passed out on the streets. Someone sent you to the hospital. Why did you keep on shouting, "Ho Kum Sui, no..." Who is he to you? He is my only buddy. My best friend. My brother. But he snatched my first love away from me. So you're also the victim of that beast? You won't understand. I really want to die. Don't ever think that. I know it's traumatic to you. I had this experience too. I understand. I really understand. "You must have loved to know love." "You must be drunk to know drunkenness." Good poem. The feeling of love is really magical. But I feel that I've wronged Fook. Silly girl. Don't say such things anymore. Ho Kum Sui is really a scumbag. Don't worry. He'll pay for his sins. Why do you bad-mouth him in front of me? You said he snatched your first love. What exactly do you want? It's true that he's wrong, but you shouldn't blame him. If anyone were at fault, it would be that woman. She misunderstood him. He was hurt by it, so he hits on girls as a way to numb himself. If anyone were at fault, it would be that woman. She just wouldn't listen to him. How could a woman be like that? That woman is responsible for causing Sui and me so much pain. Who is that woman? I remember she's called Yip Yuk Fan, Candy. She is Sui's first love. First love? Prince of Egg Tarts... what was your first love like? A wanderer like me has no first love. - Right. - Of course. Sui has only told me once about his first love. I will never forget his story. Fook, let me tell you. One's first love is the most memorable. I'm so sincere to Candy. How come she doesn't sense it at all? Why are girls always so happy when they meet the bad boys? Look, she's not mad when he peeps at her like that. He even earns her love. And studious guys like us all failed across the board. Is there a way out of this? Will I be living out the rest of my life... as a poor guy who fails to get girls? I mustn't let this go on. I have to change my fate. So I made a decision that would haunt me for the rest of my life. I decided to become a greaser. It's all for Candy's love. "I love you." Candy transferred to another school the day after the party. But I kept the letter with me... until that day when Candy burnt it. "Yip Yuk Fan" - I forgot to bring my wallet. - It's okay. Just pay it tomorrow. "Wish your business success" Little Fun. I'm here to buy take-away. The usual. Go and tell your grandpa... the diner has closed down. There won't be anymore egg tarts. I'll come later then. There won't be anymore later. I'll come again tomorrow. There won't be any tomorrow or the day after. They are gone forever. Lucky Diner does not exist anymore. Tell your grandpa not to come here to buy breakfast anymore. Go home now. Be careful when you cross the road. - Morning, Boss! - Morning! Boss, it's windy out here. Sand will get into your eyes. Right, that just happened to me. Why are you all here? We're used to getting up early. We wanted to treat you to lunch. Fai wants to cook for us today. He'll cook us a good lunch. That's right. Thanks for taking good care of me. You're so kind. We still have a few hours left. - Let's make good use of them! - Let's go... - Dad! - Fon-Fon, you came to eat with me? - Yes, do you like it? - Of course I do. You've changed so much since you came back. Have I gained weight? No, Fon-Fon, it's just that I don't hear you telling lies anymore. And you have become more considerate to others. Although I don't know who changed you... I would like to thank him if there's such a chance. I think there's no chance of meeting him again. Boss, the cover of Gossip Weekly is really ridiculous. Have a look. - Dad, don't read it! - Let me see! Come on, can it be any worse than that? Fon-Fon, see for yourself! "Confessions of Two Gay Men In The Diner?" This Shin-chan is you. This Chibi Maruko-chan is me. Those who like Chibi Maruko-chan won't hurt others. Fon-Fon! I didn't expect you would show up. Thank you. Thanks for what? I came here to shop, okay? Don't expect me to forgive you just because of the advertisements. I know I was wrong. I don't expect you to forgive me just like that. Why didn't you publish my photos? If you had done that, you would be famous. Even if I were to do it, it would not be through that magazine. I would do the publication on my own. Then why don't you do it? Go and give everyone a copy! I already did. But I only printed one copy. And you're the person I'm giving it to. "My Chibi Maruko-chan" I hope you like it. I've burnt all the negatives. You don't have to worry about anyone seeing it. Bye-bye. What's wrong with you? You burnt all the negatives? I still want to print them out for my relatives and friends. - There's nothing I can do about it. - You're really a pain in the neck. Since I still have some free time... let's go back to the diner and take those photos again. Okay. Also, this one here makes me look fat! This is baby fat. It's cute. Of course not! You're really not up to par! How can you print this out? Look how good this one is. You're just incompetent! - Come in and have a look. - Okay. - Didn't you say the shop is vacant? - It's okay. Don't fool around. I'll be here exactly at noon. Don't mess with me. Kei... Get rid of this staircase. We're better off without it. Set up a wall here... Let's check out the mezzanine floor. Let's go up and take a look. - It's really closing down. - Uncle Kin! - Boss. - I'm so sorry. I thought my granddaughter was lying. I've eaten your egg tarts for over forty years. It's a pity I can't eat them anymore. I'm sorry, Uncle Kin. Boss... I want to buy something. Move aside. There's nothing to sell now. What's wrong with you? She's only a little girl! You hag, you want to fight? You morons better stop fooling around here! You think I don't know what you're up to? You asked these old bags and kids here to earn pity! Follow my rules or you'll suffer miserably! Don't say that I didn't warn you. You have your rules, and I have mine. I accept my customers' money and I deliver. Uncle Kin, since I've taken your money, I'll give you the egg tarts. This is my diner's rule! - Guys, heat the oven! - Okay! You dare? I'll call the police if you heat the oven! I'll call the police if you don't go away. This shop belongs to us until noon. Good. Lucky Diner will turn out fresh egg tarts at noon! I'll seal your shop at noon sharp! "Confiscation Order" Freshly baked egg tarts! Condensed milk on the tarts. Spring onion fried egg with toast. Mr Li, will there be any danger? Don't worry. I'll do your business. Let's take away and eat at home. - Seal the shop! - Yes! Open the door...! Open the door if you can! Uncle Kin! Open the door and let me out! Mr Li, you must let me out. Uncle Kin, it's safer in here. Finish your drink first. Don't worry, Uncle Kin. It'll be fine. Smash the door if you dare! - That's right! Come on! - Do it... Kei, she's calling for help! Darn it! You think you're the only ones who can do it? - Let's call for help! - Call for help! Fook. Where is Sui at this critical hour? - Sui? - Yeah. Where is he? Fook! Fook! - What's with him? - He is probably scared. Don't be afraid! Look! Triad members are really loyal! Look! Tall Wai really thinks highly of us! He brought his entire gang here! Thanks a lot... I'll treat you to tea! Uncle Kin, it's safe to leave now. You have so many men now, I don't have to be scared! - I better stay and watch! - As you wish... It's really rare to see such a scene. Tall Wai is a loyal friend indeed. Thanks for coming! You brought so many guys! Tall Wai, I didn't expect you to bring so many people along. You scared me. Tall Wai, you scum! Triad members are not reliable! Mr Li, you'd better be smart and hand over the shop. - Or my boys will hurt you! - What should we do now? Let's go! What should we do now? It's too late for us to run. Let's get inside! Uncle Kin, come in here at once! You don't have what it takes to mess with me. Not now! I'm not answering the phone at this moment! - Sui? - It's Sui! Yes, it's really Sui! Thanks so much, Master Ng Lau Sau! You're welcome. It's our duty to fight against... the evils of this world. It's bad! Let's run! Darn it! Triad members are not reliable! I won't answer! Buzz off! Sui! Thank you... - Just in time... - It's okay... - Thank you, Sui! - You're welcome! Fook, isn't she your first love? Fook, we must thank Sui. He made me understand I must cherish what I've lost. You've lost... what have you lost? You, of course! After you left, I realised... you're so important to me. Sui said what he did last night was to motivate you. Motivate me? Of course. Fanny, let's motivate him more. - Get lost! - Right, no need for that! Stop acting like I'm not here! I have the warrant to repossess the shop. Go to the motel if you're horny. Bailiff, seal the shop! Hold it! I'll beat whoever approaches! - Bravo... - Beat her up... I'm Ng Lau Sau, King of Thunder Fist! - On behalf of the gods, I'll... - Can it! Who dares to get in my way? I dare! Nam and Fon-Fon! - Nam! - Dad! - Fon-Fon! - Our diner is saved! Right, my father has promised that... he won't repossess this shop, and he won't increase the rent. So the diner can remain in business! Hurrah! What are you up to, Law Chat Fai? Flirty Si, I bought up your company earlier in the morning. This shop doesn't belong to you. It belongs to me. You think money is everything? How would I not know you bought up my company? How come? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Chat Fai, it's just a small shop, why do you have to be so drastic? Flirty Si, I admit it's a little drastic, but sometimes love is really powerful. That's right, boss! What's happened today is really unbelievable. Not only this. Look. Are you all right? There's really no explanation for that. - It's really simple to explain. - What is it? It's luck! Wishing you prosperity... May everyone be as lucky as us. I wish everyone the best of luck in everything. All our egg tarts are free today! - Help yourselves to the egg tarts. - Freshly baked egg tarts... You don't have to rush. You'll all get one... - Nam, where is Fon-Fon? - She said she would be here. - Chibi Maruko-chan! - Shin-chan! - Wishing you prosperity! - Wishing you prosperity! - Am I pretty today? - Yes, you are very pretty. Then I'm all yours today. The sun is still up. Wait till night comes. What? I mean you can have me as a model today. Let's go! Excuse me, is Fook here? Happy New Year, Fanny! Fook is on the way. - Come on. Have an egg tart. - Thanks. It's delicious. I haven't had such good tarts for ages. Who baked them? Fook baked them. I love men who can cook. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Do you? Why didn't you tell me earlier? - How do you make them? - It's easy. It's like this... - Kei! - Christine, why are you so late? I really missed you! Everyone has a partner. I really envy them. Don't be envious. - Sorry, I'm late. - May? Sui, I've finally found someone who is of the same channel. - What channel? - It's not AM and it's not FM. It's SM! Don't be envious. They're all so happy. This will be a lucky year. Sui, aren't you in luck? Happy New Year! Wishing you prosperity! It's the New Year. I can't be stingy on this. - Thanks! - I'm in luck! I told her everything. Candy, I... Bravo...!
