Little girl, why are you crying? My kitten was trying to catch a little bird up in the tree. But now he can't get down. Don't cry. Uncle will help you, okay? Thank you, Uncle. Uncle will go put his things in the car first. Can I hold them for you, Uncle? Sure, thank you, little girl. I caught it. Hey little girl, where are you going? I caught the cat for you. Uncle, that cat isn't mine. I'm going home now. Thanks for the presents, bye. You little liar. Hey, fatso, do you want to steal my cat? I'm not stealing him. Just checking if he has hemorrhoids. Really? Oh, you were checking someone's ass. Help! There's a pervert! Come and catch the pervert! Little beard. Help me catch a pervert! It's that fat guy! Hey, can you stop shouting? You're making a scene. Haven't you seen someone climb a tree before? Fatso, your taste is questionable. Can't you find someone better to peep at? Is this really what you like? Hey, don't kick a dog when it's down. Who's a dog? I see a wolf. Serves you right! You were asking for it. Shoot him again, for me. Crazy bastard! That was mean! Help me! - Thanks. - Any time. Now get lost, I'm breaking up with you. Let's make up. You deserve it! Get out of the way, oh my god. Stop the trolley! Isn't it your job to save people in danger? Where are you going, sir? Take him to the hospital. I won't go to the hospital, they'll just make it worse. You can claim compensation for injury in the line of duty. Robbery! Robbery! Police! Push him out! Who taught you to drive? - Fortune favours the brave! - Death before dishonour! Don't move! Stay here! Stop! Don't move. I'm a cop! Stop. - Don't move - I'm a cop! Call an ambulance. Are you trying to get killed? Everyone's suicidal today. Watch it, or you'll be in trouble. Don't move. If you shoot he'll die too. Is his life for my life a good deal? The gun wasn't pointed at me. Was it a good shot? That bastard was gambling with my life. He died instantly, no chance to react. Someday the shoe will be on the other foot. Come on then! Please spare my life! It's me. You almost scared me to death. You can't die. The three of us promised we'd always be together. After your sister comes out, what's the first thing we should do? For you: breast implants, then you can get a nose job and eyelid surgery. Wrong, we're getting on a plane. After waiting on others for years, it's our turn to be served. We will travel the world in first class and make the most of life. Carrie, are you alright? Go, Ping Ping, run! Nice kick man! Freeze! Police, I am a police officer. Brother. Carrie! We're supposed to enjoy life together! This is no time to talk, I'll distract the black guy, get out of here. She's lucky. Where did those two killers come from? Are these girls unlucky or is there more than meets the eye? Good morning, boss. Good morning, boss. Boss Boss, the two hitmen and Carrie... all are dead. I think everyone in Hong Kong knows that by now, thanks. The other girl is in the hospital I've already ordered No. 2 and 3 to be on standby What are you waiting for? We received news that she's gone crazy She's so naive Thinking that pretending to be crazy can save her Boss, don't worry, we'll take action immediately Are the thieves bad shots or are you just lucky? Twenty shots fired and not a mark on you. At least you should have a flesh wound, or a second asshole. Your mouth is filthy. I haven't brushed my teeth in days. So what? Do you like the smell? You're wasting my talents, I can't believe you assigned me to guard duty. Good morning, Sir. How is the witness doing? She's behaving very well. Oh, that's why you're well-behaved. You can't do anything bad. Hey, not bad huh? With your foul mouth what woman would want you? Maybe this one? Hello, lovely girl. Woof. Calm, calm... good doggy. Dogs make good pets, right? If you don't want to watch her, I can find someone else. I think she's already attached to me Ho Sir, this is Dr. Jiang. Hello, Dr. Jiang. How is the patient doing? The woman's brain has suffered a severe trauma. This has caused temporary neurological dysfunction. We have already done a brain scan. If there is no progress, we will send her to a larger hospital for treatment. If there's nothing else, let her get some rest. Thank you, doctor. I'll let you investigate the case. I think the patient needs special care. - You mean you fancy her? - Don't upset her. She'll be your sister-in-law soon. Let me know immediately if anything happens. Will a crazy person's children be crazy too? Sir, the door is not locked. Ho Sir, allow me. Ho Sir, looks we're too late. We're not late at all, we arrived just in time. How so? If we had come earlier, how would we know that someone had already searched the place? Right, if we had come earlier, we might have run into them. Maybe there'd be a gunfight and I'd have been shot. That would have been much worse luck. If you're so afraid of death better not eat dinner tonight. Why not? You might choke to death. I don't think that will happen. Ho Sir, that woman is very wealthy, see. All three women are very wealthy. So flight attendants are loaded, huh? I've got to get myself one. Does this look suit you? Does it matter? If I have money, I can buy another hat. You need to eat something. I'll feed you, no need to use your hands. These grapes are from California. They're so sweet and fragrant. Try them, they're really sweet. If you don't eat them, I will. I'll be upset if you don't eat them. Good girl. Aren't they really tasty? Have some more. Now it's your turn to feed me. It's a little bit gross. Why did you eat so many if you think they're disgusting? I'll eat disgusting things, if it gets you to speak. See how kind I am? You're a tricky one. Miss, where are you going? Can't we go for a late night snack? You can go, but she can't. Who said that? Mr. Ho said that. He isn't here now. He outranks you, I have to follow his orders. It's okay, Honey. I'll bring the food back. It's like you're trying to make me look bad. It isn't like that, we respect you. Liars, I know what people think of me. If she loses a single hair, you'll be looking for new jobs. Don't fall asleep. What did he say? Yes, yes, what? The doctor said you were sleeping on the job. He's going to report the two of you. Foreigners are really troublesome. Come and give me a hand. Lucky boy! Get lost. Where is the witness? I really am lucky! Is the patient acting up? Never seen a dead person before? What happened, miss? The police officers were all killed. Excuse me, have you seen a doctor and a nurse pushing a patient? They were just there. Don't move! Raise your hands and slowly turn around. What's the problem, officer? None of your business. Have you seen a foreign doctor and nurse pushing a patient? - They went that way. - Thanks! What are you doing? Don't push me. Fatso, you're not dead? If my hands weren't full you'd be the one who's dead. Trying to act cool? Your girlfriend has been kidnapped! Then why aren't you going after her? Waiting for you to finish your meal. What do you want? Why did you step on my car? - Hey, get off my car. - This is outrageous. You can't go this way. Auntie, it's Ping Ping. Can I stay at yours tonight? What, come to my place? Yesterday some people came looking for you. I didn't answer so they flipped over my mahjong table! I finally had a winning hand! One, four, seven, bamboo. You have to compensate me. Hey, do you hear me? You've been a police officer for so long, how can you be tricked so easily? She manipulated you into leaving your post to buy food. A blessing in disguise. If I hadn't gone out to buy supper, you wouldn't be scolding me. You'd be mourning me. Yes, I was very sad. Since the time I chaired a committee, do you know how long it's been since I appeared on TV? But I'm lucky, I'll have the opportunity to appear tomorrow. To explain to the public why my officers opened fire on a busy street, turned a hospital into a battlefield, lost an important witness, with two officers killed in the line of duty. How am I to explain it? Hey? - Chan Sir... - What? You always want the credit, well you can have a share of the blame too. Can you help me out, please? You're being too modest, Chief. Our success is all thanks to your leadership. Everyone should take responsibility. Dream on. You're going to take the blame for this mess. How many people are in the department? There are men, women, old, young. Why did you pick this useless fool to handle this case? How do you explain yourself? If I had the ability, I would teach you how to do it. Unfortunately, I don't. People without ability have to protect themselves. So I won't take the blame for you. I'm giving you a deadline. You have one week to solve this case. Otherwise, you'll bear full responsibility. My whole body is bruised now. Do you think his fingers don't hurt? Ho Sir, the witness has been found. Where? She was drinking at the Peninsula Hotel, eating steak and oysters. Said she was the Queen of England and they had to let her eat for free. So the hotel staff brought her here. She's crazy, but she's smart. What do you want? Brother, please don't get in my way. Don't break us up. I fell in love. Tang Sir, you're in love? He's crazy. The outsider sees clearly. The person involved is confused. So let me be crazy in love! Ho Sir really likes you. He asked if you would like to go see a movie with him. If he wants to ask me out, can't he do it himself? He's very shy. - Thank you, Lily. - You're welcome. I have plans tonight. The progress of science has its pros and cons. What do you mean, Ho Sir? Fast and accurate data is good. What's the downside? We found the suspect so fast, no time to go on a date. Why are you flirting when we could be catching the suspect? Your identity has been exposed. The boss wants you to go back to Holland and lay low. He's sending someone to bring you money. Be careful. Don't touch those cows. Rural folk are not to be messed with. So what? At most I'll have to pay for it. Can you afford it? Alright, I'll play the role of the farmer. My bulls here are for breeding. Five hundred per time, ten times is five thousand. When they're in heat, they can do it seven or eight times a day. Can you afford it? It was a female cow I hit. Even better. My female cows give birth to two calves per year. If they're both male, I can put them both to stud. So valuable? I'd better drive into the ditch instead. You got it. Be careful. What does my mother have to do with this? Stop acting tough, we've got things to do. You've had a lucky escape, foreigner. - It's a dead end. - This is bad! Quick, chase after that foreigner! If I catch up to you, you're finished. I really drove into a ditch! This makes me look low class. What are you doing? I want to help Little Beard maintain a healthy image. Too late, I'll put it back. Oh, so this room isn't yours? What was that? Nothing, nothing to see here. I want to look! - You can't look. - I want to see. It bites. I like to be bitten. Okay, okay, you can look. It's none of my business. - Quick, take off your clothes. - Take off my clothes? Hurry up. OK, why are you in such a rush? She will catch a cold without clothes. You want to give her my clothes? Just cover her with a blanket. Please take a look, my taste is very different. What is this? It's a TV remote control. - Can we watch TV? - Of course, we see better from the bed. Aren't we watching TV? Yes, let's watch music videos. - You can do it. - Okay. - Who sings this song? - Madonna. Women's wrestling competition, they're really amateurish. There goes my good reputation. Little Beard is back. Why did he come back so early? To cock-block me. Uncle Mak. - Where's Sun Chun? - He hasn't come back yet. That's Honey. Come with me to beat someone up. Can you go by yourself, I'm busy. I see. Uncle's in trouble and you're too busy. Some friend you are. Calm down. Do you think you're still a teenager? You can't just beat people up. You have no loyalty. If it weren't for the fact I fought my way out of Sai Ying Pun you two wouldn't be here today. Uncle Mak, that's all in the past. The past, is it? It feels like the present to me! Great, great! It's just the scar from an appendectomy. Surgery? Do you think I had six appendixes? OK Uncle, hold onto this for now. Honey, let's go back to our room. What happened to bros before hoes? I'll come back and steal your girl. What are you so upset about? Embarrassed in front of your girl? Your dad said he doesn't trust women, so why did he take her as his follower? He's obviously trying to steal my girlfriend. If you hadn't brought her back here there wouldn't be a problem. You can't just take a witness home, there's paperwork. She's safer here. Not safe from you though. I'm too tired to talk to you, good night. Hey, hey, why are you getting into my bed? I've given her my room, of course. Come to bed and shut up. Or sleep on the sofa. Why should I sleep on the sofa? I'll go to your room and sleep with her. Go ahead, you're not her type. Watermelon juice in the morning will help your bowel movements. Really? That's exactly what he needs. He's constipated all year round. - That's you. - Really? Yes, that's why he needs you to stay and make juice for us. You guys enjoy. I'll go wash your underwear for you. Don't bother with his, it's beyond cleaning. She's really quite cute. Her fried eggs are delightful. Hurry up and eat. Eat. Why are you staring at me like that? Haven't you seen me enough these past ten years? More than enough. I'll call the company. - What company? - The moving company. You can move back in with your dad tomorrow. I'll pay the rent here myself. What do you mean? Don't pretend innocence. Three's a crowd and all that. Hey, you're becoming more and more incoherent. You're wrong, I'm just starting to think clearly. We're just a bad match. You're very carefree but I feel lonely, eating alone every day. Then don't eat so much. Remember, being unfilial is a sin, leaving no descendants is the worst. It's my duty to extend the family line. Did you know our colleagues think we're in a homosexual relationship? Am I not letting you get married? Or does nobody want to marry you? You're wrong again. She and I fell in love at first sight. Who just made you fried eggs? And who's washing your underwear now? You're benefiting from her feelings for me, big brother. Big brother? Snap out of it. She's a witness. You're right. She's a witness. She's not a prisoner so you don't need to follow her 24/7. Following her day and night... you're trying to seduce your sister-in-law! Say what? You've lost the plot. Please don't break us up. After years of friendship, you should want the best for me. Give me your support, encourage me to achieve my dream. Okay? Okay, you can keep watch over her whilst I go to work. Will that do? That's better. Don't come back tonight. Done. An elegant and warm home for two. Do you like it? Oh hubby, I really like it. And how about the living room? Do you like it? My love, I like whatever you like. Hi. There you are. You even look lovely dressed as a man. If I were a girl, I would definitely fall for you. It wouldn't work. Why not? You look too manly, I wouldn't be interested. Ah yes, luckily my mum made me as a boy. What shall we eat? Japanese food is delicate, Korean food is spicy. Sichuan cuisine is too spicy. Cantonese cuisine has a lot of variety. Teochew cuisine is light. Hakka cuisine is economical. Steak is boring. French cuisine is pretentious. Pretentious? That's what they say, I don't know. Okay, let's be pretentious. Okay. Wanna run? Take the woman and kill the fat one. I feel dizzy. You're still pretending to be crazy. They won't come after me if they think I'm crazy. Bullshit. You wanted to avoid answering my questions. OK it's true. Why haven't you asked me any? I'll start now. Go ahead. Miss Ko Sau Ping. Don't call me Ko Sau Ping. I didn't choose to be born a Ko. I prefer to choose my own name. I like it when people call me "Big Sister". Have you finished venting, Big Sister? On that day, what were you doing there in the middle of the night? What do you think? Having dinner at the beach. Then I went swimming. Why aren't I dead? Tang Sir. Please cooperate. After Ho Sir extracts a confession, we will explain everything. Forcing a confession? Not talking won't solve my problems. Brother, please don't treat me like a criminal. Can you treat me like your younger sister instead? No, because I'm a police officer. Does that make you special? Yes, because I'm the banker and you're just a player. The banker always wins. Why is it that every time you and your sister Carrie come back from a flight... ...the very next day, money is deposited into your accounts. Many women work overseas as escorts. The anti-corruption unit can't do anything about it. Is that it? I'm not cheap like you. Good comeback. Don't act so righteous. You haven't answered my question yet. We earn money by smuggling. What do you smuggle? Diamonds. Who do you smuggle for? You're still covering for him? He's trying to get rid of you. Boss Li. Believe me? Yes. There's no reason not to. Don't crush me. Since you help him smuggle goods, why does he want you dead? Your sister was recently detained by Dutch customs. Could it be because of this? Since you already know everything, why are you still asking me? - Why are you angry? - Yes I'm angry! I'm unreasonable. I'm unstable! Fatty died for you, does it mean nothing? Shut up, stop talking. I don't want to listen. Honey, I was dead but... I've come back to life. Oh, you're in cahoots with him. - You two conspired to deceive me. - No, not me. It's got nothing to do with me. Stop it. Sit down. Honey, he bullied me. Don't worry. You're an educated man, can't you act more civilised? I haven't finished questioning her, why did you barge in? This is my home. Honey, don't be afraid. I'm here. Tang Tat Kit. I'm going to pull rank on you. If you don't leave immediately, I'll charge you with obstructing official business. Official business should be handled at the station, not at home. Did you all hear that? Everyone, go back to the station. Police officers are always on duty. Under any circumstances, at any time and any place, they must uphold the law. They are my subordinates, they must obey my orders. And this is also my house, with my consent, they have the absolute right to stay. Fine, if you won't leave, I will. Honey, let's go. You can't leave, I have questions. If you have questions, ask me. I'll pass them on. Honey, let's go. He's obstructing an officer in the line of duty. Cuff him! Arrest me? - Boss... - Don't call me that. Who hit me before? Who hit me? You all took part. I'll sue you under Article 19: Causing bodily harm. Well? Get out of my way! Cuff him, I'll take full responsibility. Oh, you're abusing your power to intimidate me. - You're forcing me to do this. - You're ruthless. Tell them to cuff me. Don't mess around, Tang Sir. Ho Sir, I didn't see anything. We didn't see anything either. Obstructing official duties and threatening a superior officer. Do you know how long you'll be in jail? I'll chop your head off then you can add a charge of murder. Why are you putting your subordinates in this situation? I didn't expect you to be such a fool. I'm serious this time. Alright, let's call it a day. What? Time to go home. Good job, team. Next time you want to chop me, use a sharper blade. You're good. Ouch, it hurts. Wait for me here. Boss, he's from the serious crime unit. He wants to talk to you. It's probably about Ko Sau Ping. Officer Ho, looking for me? Are you thinking of changing careers? I wanted to ask you for guidance. Boss, do you know how to read fortunes? Men are speaking, women should be quiet. Raise your hand if you want to speak. Recently there's a criminal case, someone wants to make a movie about it. But the plot stops halfway. It just stops. I need your help to push the plot forward. Why didn't you tell me you were producing a movie? What's the story about? The story is about three beautiful flight attendants. They're forced to help a villain smuggle goods abroad. One goes to jail, one dies, and one goes crazy. Which character do you think I should play? Did you raise your hand? Where is the crazy one now? She's living with two police officers. She's very safe. She's even in a romantic relationship with one of them. In their home? Shouldn't they be at a hotel? That's where witnesses usually stay. That's true. But this is a movie. Boss, I want to play the crazy one. Mr. Li, what do you think about the plot? Where should it go from here? Look, if these two ants weren't attached to this blade of grass, they wouldn't have been caught. If they hadn't bitten me, they wouldn't have been killed. If they could turn back time, what do you think they would do? If I were one of those ants, I would leave that blade of grass as soon as possible. I'd definitely live longer. Miss, do you understand what they are talking about? Not at all. I really don't understand. See? Boss Li, you're more educated than us, can you put it more simply? I came here today to tell you that Ko Sau Ping is in my hands. As soon as I have enough evidence, I'll put you in jail. Settle your affairs. And you. Ah Kau. Yes boss. It seems like the police are never chosen for an outstanding citizen award. It seems like it. I nominate Officer Ho Sun-Chun. An outstanding young man! Spend whatever it takes to see he wins. Food's here. Oh, illegal gambling! I'd better report it. Shut up. This crap again! Here you go. Here. Be careful, or you'll get a beating from Ho Sir. Just like any other day then. - Ho sir, your food - Thanks I'm sorry we couldn't have French cuisine. Sorry to make you eat takeout. It's fine, let's have hot pot and get to know each other. Sound good. Let's light a lamp for a more romantic atmosphere. How lovely! Boss, he really has set the bait in the trap. He wants the mantis to chase the cicada, while leaving the bird alone. If the mantis eats the cicada, what will happen to the bird? Then she'll be a roast pigeon. Ho Sir, are those people as dangerous as you say? You might find one bulletproof vest isn't enough. With food this delicious, who wouldn't be a little chubby. It's not so bad to be chubby, at least you'll have curves, right? I always find that I feel sleepy after eating... Shall we go to bed now? I'll run a bath for you first. Thanks. Two ducks swim together, playing in the pool... Get out quickly. Someone set fire to our car, Sir. No slacking off even if there's a fire. Don't leave your post. The other car is on fire now. Calling Ah Leung. - What's going on? - There's a fire Get out and take care of it. - I'll go take a look. - Sit down, I have a winning hand. - We can check it out after. - It's us that's on fire, get out! Quickly, go and get the fire extinguisher. Sir, this is no accidental fire. It's arson. The situation here is critical. Move the camera back into position. - Did you hear me? - Call the fire brigade. You lost, go! Aim the camera at the rooftop, I need to see what's happening up there. Warn Tang they're coming. We'll block their escape route. What's the hell? Catch her! - Don't run! - I'll die if I don't. Where's fatty? Goddamn kid! - What's all the noise about? - Watch out! Don't run! Boss, you should let me handle it next time. If you can handle it, do it now! Don't run. Your boss is in trouble, go and help him. Let's go together. - Freeze! - Go! Don't run. Your heartbeat is too loud. I can't help it. Why? Take this. Take it! Think I won't recognize you with a mask on? I'll deal with you later. If he moves, shoot him. Don't move. Ho Sir, what should we do? His big foreign head should be easy to hit. Just treat it like a game of chance. Damn it. Foreigner, don't mess around. Don't panic. He died instantly, not even enough time to blink. If your aim is so good, why fire two shots? The first shot is to kill, the second shot is just for style. How was it? Were you scared just now? Could I do this job if I was scared of death? If you're all here, who's with the witness? Oh yeah, where's my Honey? Don't worry, I handcuffed her to the motorcycle. Sounds safe. Who's driving? Where are my keys? Honey, it's safe now, you can come back! Don't shoot, we need her alive. Watch where you're going. If you damage my car, you can't afford to pay for it. If you don't move immediately, I'll charge you with obstructing police business. Fine. What a piece of junk. Why did you have to drive this car today? Tomorrow, drive it into the sea. Where did all these cops come from? So what if there are cops? I'm telling you, going against the rich in Hong Kong is futile. You'll lose every time. Can you afford to mess with me? Did anyone see what happened? - You must have seen something - Sir, I saw it. I saw that brown-noser get blown away by a rich guy's fart. Wow! What an amazing fart! Where's the goods? Where's the money? They're all here. My sister said you were reliable. In the world of martial arts, our fate is decided for us, sister. Decided by who, sister? Don't come any closer. How many people can you kill with six bullets? At least one. How dare you set me up. Don't let her escape. (Tagalog) Sisters, after her! (Tagalog) We let the Golden Goose fly away. You've been sending people after me, there must be a reason. Now I'm here, what do you want? I want to get that batch of goods back. Your goods were confiscated by the Dutch customs. You know that. Your sister was intentionally caught by Dutch customs. Only one third of that batch was confiscated. Where are the remaining two-thirds? I think you know. What did you say? You thought this amateurish plan would fool me? If you want to get the rest back it'll cost you two million. You must be dreaming! I have two cops backing me up. You have 24 hours. When the time comes I'll let you know where to make the drop. Now take off your pants. - Take them off. - They're already off. Don't mess with me. - My patience is running out. - Okay, I'll take them off. For you. It's a famous brand. I'm worth it. Ah Kau! What happened? Boss. Your boss was stripped naked by a woman. Give me your clothes. Yes boss. I'm in trouble this time. Cheer up! A smile can make you ten years younger, while a worry can turn your hair white. You're still a bachelor. With white hair all over, who would marry you? Look after yourself. Do you remember what to do later? Your attitude is hard to imitate. Learn from me, learn from Judge Bao. You'll have to face sister-in-law later. As soon as you see a pretty girl, you forget your ancestors. Wouldn't you have chased her if I hadn't moved first? Let's not talk about this anymore. Practise makes perfect. Let's go through it again. Will she definitely come back? Both sides are looking for her, where else can she go? Can you be serious? I'm depending on you. You dared to come back? Isn't this my home now? I miss you so much. Stop fooling around. Get up! I hurt my ass, don't you have any sympathy? Be gentle, please. From now on, I have no heart. Your seduction skills have no effect on me. For real? If we fake it, will you be ready? You need to get serious. Alright, alright. Let's practise one more time. Be serious. Of course. I'm asking you, did you steal my gun? You're speaking so harshly. We're husband and wife, can't I use your gun? You've messed up my hair. How can I face people like this? He's imitating you. But I have never let him touch me. Who would admit to that? It's the truth! Okay, if you say so. No crying allowed. What were you doing with that fat woman in Victoria Park ? - We're lesbians. - Is that so? Stop hitting me! I don't want to play this game anymore. Speak. Those people were sent by Boss Li to kill me. I scared them off with your gun. I worked so hard to come back, just to get shouted at! Still lying. If he wanted to kill you, you would have been dead long ago. - You're wicked. - Tell me what's really going on. - Nothing. - Did you steal something from him? No. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. You're accusing an innocent person. Good. If you don't come clean, I'll have to get tough. It's just a rehearsal. Stop hitting me. At least not so hard. I'm showing you how it's done. Will she talk if you're just tickling her? If I treat her like this I'd be a monster. Master, they're really ruthless. They want to use torture to extract a confession. Thank goodness you're here to protect me. You'll have to bend the knee if you want me to help you. Let me tell you, Sifu isn't all-powerful, I can only try. Don't move! Dad? Honey! You want to kill me for your inheritance? It's chaotic these days. How could I know it was you out there? You guys are just messing around. Let me make it clear. If anyone touches her, they'll have to deal with me. Dad come into the room to discuss something. Borrow money again? Fatty, don't mess around. Here you go. Do you look different now? Have you lost weight? You look thinner. Stop beating around the bush. Aren't you going to hit me? The boss's commands, the subordinate obeys. He told me to hit you, what can I do? Wise people use their words, fools use their fists. He told you not to bother with me, will you listen? I know I'm stupid. That's why I've always hoped for a clever wife to take care of me. Alright, everything is clear. Listen. Chun has a duty to fulfill. Although he uses tough measures, he means well. Tang Kit is trapped because of your stunning beauty. He is following his heart. And what about you, little girl? In the world of martial arts, one's fate is not entirely their own. I, Bao Qingtian's second generation, have been gone a long time. But I'm still as strong as ever. These young and inexperienced guys have nothing on me. Alright, from today on, let's be united. If we work together we'll be unstoppable. Am I right? What does Sifu command? Don't lie to Sifu. What are you hiding? Speak. This old fox is even more cunning than those two cops. How do I get out of this? I can sacrifice one. So many people died for this little thing. You must be sad that your sister is in jail. You must be heartbroken that your friend died. Alright, let's go on a trip to relax. What's so strange about that? We can soak up some sun in Hawaii. Her treat! The girl has three strong men to protect her. Even Boss Li can't touch her. Nothing to worry about. Thank you, Master. What kind of trick are you playing? We'll go along with her plan. My dad and I will accompany you two on your honeymoon. If you're not happy, we don't have to go. Don't kid around. Only your muddle-headed dad would be charmed by her. I'm sure she's up to something. If she hadn't gone off with dad would you be so clear-headed? Of course she's up to something. So much trouble over just one diamond? You're right... ... must be after her body. We'll use their plan against them. Escort her out of Hong Kong. And when the time is right, strip her naked. See how many diamonds she has on her. I'll strip her, you count the diamonds. You're incorrigible. Thank you. So much? Ten, hundred, thousand, hundred thousand... - Half a million? - Times two is a million. We can't spend that in our lifetime. We can't spend it at all! We've been set up! Let's go back and clear our names. It must be Boss Li, damn it! With one million, we can eat hamburgers every day! You guys came back just in time. Let me introduce you. This is Ho Sun Chun, and this is Tang Tat Kit. These two are from the Anti-Corruption Unit. Please go with them. I'm Director Xie from the ICAC Action Team. This is my assistant, Tony Wong. We have reports of suspicious deposits in your bank accounts. But if you can provide a reasonable explanation, you'll be cleared soon. - You both have the right... - ...to remain silent. Anything you say can be used as evidence in court. We've said this to many people before. I'll find someone to take over your case. Do you have any requests? Don't worry. Come on, let's sort this out. I request a girl to accompany me. You'll have to make do with me. Please. Thank you for your cooperation, Chan Sir. Why are you being so polite? Sorry, you bumped into me. Ho Sir. Tang Sir. Don't worry, we are innocent. It'll be fine. They're taking us for coffee, does anyone want to come? What's the matter? They're not going to the execution ground, just the Anti-Corruption Unit. Sorry, I must stop doing that. What are you looking at? We're not saying goodbye. They'll be back soon. Let's go do our jobs. I need to sleep for two days. Where are you going? - To the market. - What for? To buy some grapefruit to scrub myself clean. - Buy two more. - Whatever. Don't move, put your hands down. We're really unlucky, either being arrested or getting robbed. Not a robbery, a kidnapping. Let's go. Are these two ants still here? They'll be leaving soon. Not so tough now. Do you have any bullets left? I saved one to test your heroism. Why are you staring at each other? I'll help you, fatty. Don't look so glum, I'll help you. The gun is aimed at him. If you pull the trigger, you won't have to die. Come on. Ah Kau. How do those two heroes look now? Let me see. They're really colorful, boss. Are you sure you're not mistaken? It's true. This fat ant isn't very smart. Let's see who has more bullets. Fine, you win. Cease fire, cease fire. You played well. Fattie, I'll die with you. Hold on I'm coming! A shame this skinny ant couldn't last a bit longer. Must be malnourished Let's go. Boss, why don't we just get rid of them? If I was just going to kill them, why put so much money into their accounts? What do you want? Fatty, he's too kind to you. Have a few punches from me, too. Sun Chun! Don't trip and hurt yourself. You're not dead yet, then? How could I die before you? Is Honey okay? Love is truly great. We nearly died just now, and you're worried about her? It really must be love. I'm impressed. Preparation saves lives. If someone shoots your head, you're still dead. Why are you staring at her? She spoke the truth. Then why did you tell me to bring an extra one? I think the pillows here are too soft, use it to make them firmer. What a waste. How can I get away from these pains in the ass? Where are you going? Want to grope me? I'm hungry, I'm going to eat. Hey, hey, you can't go. I insist on going. Where do you want to go? Senior brothers, you came just in time. She's making trouble. - What's the matter? - Stay down. Why are you making a mess? I have an appointment with your boss anyway - let's go. Are you ready to leave yet? - What's that for? - Keep quiet Come on. They really do work! Idiot. Aren't you going to thank me for saving your life? Thank you, thank you. Dad. Dad. This is bad, we're finished this time. How did you know? How could I not know? It's my passport that's expired. How can I go on vacation with you guys tomorrow? If you can't go, then I won't go either. Right, Uncle Mark. No point going if you're not going. We'll stay here with you. You guys are really filial. Stop talking nonsense. Hey, where's the girl? She's... Alright... what's happened? Speak. You speak. My mouth's full. Who are you looking for? Sifu, it's your disciple. Is senior brother there? Honey, do you want senior brother or me? Stop arguing. I've been kidnapped by Boss Li. They won't release me until I give them the diamond. Then give it back to them. You fool, listen up. Don't give it back to them under any circumstances. If they get their hands on it, they'll kill you. What should I do? Sifu, save me. What do you want us to do? Yes, Honey, what can we do to help? I'd go through hell or high water for you, my love! Say something, Honey! Use the diamonds to ransom me. Where did you put them? Where are they? They're inside the bulldog statue in your bedroom. What kind of dog? Looks like a tiger. Go fetch it. If you mess up the deal, she won't survive. We won't mess it up. Just bring three million to buy back the goods. What? I have your woman, why should I give you three million? Kid, are you crazy? Who's crazy? With three million dollars I can have as many women as I want. Ho Sun-Chun, you're really... Well, Boss? Okay, it's a deal. An easy decision, it's a small deal for you. I looked everywhere, I can't find... Three days from now, we'll meet at 10 a.m., in a secluded bay. You nearly ruined everything. I really can't find it, why don't you look? Of course you can't find it. Would such a cunning thief hide it somewhere so obvious? You don't need to patronise me. Dad, where are you going? To buy a dog statue. Boss Li, I thought maybe you couldn't afford my fee. The money is here, the goods? Right here. I'd like to see the money, if you don't mind. He's probably never seen so much before. Three million. Your turn. Alright, my turn to show you something new. Hold on, if it falls into the sea, who will be responsible? Alright, you can open it yourself. Hey, don't forget the money. When men are talking, women shouldn't interrupt. If you want to speak, raise your hand. I see you're becoming a fan of my Boss. Why are you still over there with the rich people? Come over here quickly. So Boss Li wants my second-hand goods. OK, all yours! What? Don't try to play tricks on me. I coul kill you right now. Think I'm scared because there are more of you? Release her and we'll make the deal right away. Boss, don't be impulsive. This belongs to you, you can make the deal yourself. Be careful. Jump in the water. For the sake of fairness. We make the deal together, on the count of three. Are you afraid he'll fly away? Ready. 1-2-3 Jump. Just as I expected. Luckily, I set up a trap. When that girl comes up, I'll give her the kiss of life. What about the guy? He's all yours. Thank you, boss. Well, this should be fun. Where are our men? They were all killed by the fat guy. What happened? It was a trap. Even the best horses stumble. Boss, give me another chance. When you hear an explosion, go collect the bodies. Master Come up, girl, let's talk. - I really need to piss - Do it in the water, please. Uncle Mark, move the boat closer. Uncle Mark, give me a hand. Here. Are you feelong sea-sick? What are you doing, girl? Master, sorry but I have no choice. - They're police and I'm a thief. - Don't be silly. Honey, I love you! Don't leave me! Shut up, fatso. Master, I know you care for me. But I need this money to save my sister. I will repay you in the future. My Honey is running away and no one is helping me chase her. Why bother? You'll just say I'm seducing your wife. What are you talking about? Stop arguing and chase her! Why do people trade their lives for money? My Honey died a terrible death. She got a good deal. If I caught her, it would have been worse. If they caught her it would be worse still. Honey, I will avenge you. Less talking, more action. Dad, be careful. Let's see what tricks you have up your sleeves. The boat is empty, where are they? Move, quickly! How the fuck did you get your boating license? What are you doing? Do you think the boss can't hit him? He's just playing with him. Stop kissing ass and get them! Sun Chun's in trouble. He deserves it. I mean he deserves to live. Are you so sure you'll win? I'm sure I can beat you. Cut! Cut the ropes! Gasoline? Be careful where you shoot. Uncle Mark. Put it out! Let's get out of here! Boss, your aim is too accurate! The goddess scatters flowers, let's see where you can run! Quickly, let's get out of here! Boss, look over there! Fire! Go quickly! Quick! Help the boss get out. Boss, be careful. Don't move! Police. It's really a bad plan, facing real guns with fake. Die! Shit, wrong one! I almost blew it! Everyone, charge up there and kill them! Charge! Just like a real gun. Don't move. Put down the gun. You don't understand English? Do I have to speak French? Maybe you understand Japanese? Baka-yaru! (Japanese insult) You're cunning, but you're too slow to act. Slow, am I? Your childishness is going to get us killed. A movie prop? The bullets are fake! What do we do if they realise it's a trick? Hey. Come on, time for the next part of the plan. Boss! They're using movie props! Charge up and take them out! A real bomb! Look out! Afraid of firecrackers, motherfucker? Isn't that too cruel? Stop chattering, it's your turn. Why are you giving me a lit one? My aim is surprisingly good. Yes, but your timing needs work. You two are still fighting? Did you forget we're at war? Watch me. That was close, they almost hit me. Retreating almost killed us both! Even from this far my aim is spot on. A blind cat still catches some mice. Think you can catch me? I'm not a blind cat. He's getting away! Go! Where are you running to? Such a big target, do you need to aim so carefully? Keep quiet. Were you aiming at the sea? - Not the sea, the sky. - Good shot then. Sun Chun, don't chase him. A rich man like him can't hide. Fucking boat... Do you want my money or my life? You're a cop, I'm a thief. What's the worst that could happen? How long will I be in jail? Listen, I have plenty of money to hire lawyers. Send me to the district court or the high court, I won't be found guilty. Jail is for poor people. Come on, what's your price? One million. Three million. Five million. What do you say? - Are you really worth that much? - Much more! Who cares if you're rich. Look - Honey is over there! Looks like the sea god didn't want her. I'm going to beat her up. - Can you really do it this time? - For sure. Still alive then? Why aren't you hitting her? I just... Uncle Mark, come over here. I have to ask you something. I know you're angry with her, but can you hit me instead? Are you even a man? I'm a man, so I have to protect women. You just said you wanted to hit her. But I'm a big man, so I'll take the blows meant for her. Don't fight each other. I've lost everything. You can arrest me if you want. You're wrong! You have youth, energy and looks. Great figure front and back. Am I being too vulgar? Why don't you hit me? If you can't bear to hit me, you can curse at me instead. Nothing you say is going to get through to her. I have something that might. Give it to me! - He swallowed it. - Spit it out right now! I'll beat it out of you! Too late to spit it out. Whoever wants it, speak up. You can watch me shit every day! Bye bye! Master, hurry and chase after him! Still think I'll do anything you ask? Your wish is my command! Bastard, stop right there!
