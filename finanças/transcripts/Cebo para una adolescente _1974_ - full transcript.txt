Good morning, don Ignacio. Come in, Antonio. Sit down. -Sit down, please. -Thank you. I'm sorry to bother you, don Ignacio but I had to talk to you about my daughter, Maribel. She's been studying for the selection tests but she has some trouble with languages. What's the matter with languages? You'll understand I couldn't afford to send her abroad and here they're hard for her. I've taken lessons. But it's so difficult for me. Don't worry. Main thing is your father has been many years with us. We are like a big family. Don't you think so, Antonio? What would be this company without men like your father. Besides, youth must take the lead. How do you manage with typing and tachygraphy? Good. She's very good at that, don Ignacio. Don't worry then. Your daughter will work in our company. I'm going to hire more staff and Maribel will be a good secretary. I don't know how I'll pay you back all you are doing for us. No, you don't have to thank me. It's a matter of justice and I like to help those who work with me. So just chill out. And right after the exams she'll begin the work. Thank you, don Ignacio. When do the exams take place? Tomorrow typing and tachygraphy and after tomorrow English. That's the one I fear most. As I said, just chill out. And now forgive me. I have a lot of work. Thank you very much and forgive the disturbance. Good bye. Can you turn down the volume? Curro turn off the TV. I'm watching it. You are playing and your sister is studying. Turn it off, don't make me mad. Where is my "ball"? (he says it in English) What do you say? Where is my "ball". "Ball", that's ball in English. You know nothing at all. Curro, don't disturb me or you'll get some. Besides, your ball isn't here. Here is the ball! As mentioned regarding your visit to Spain we shall be awaiting your reply regarding our planned meetings which will be held here, these meetings on May the 15th. The meetings to be held on this date will be in relation to new construction processes. These new construction processes are being used in all subdivision developments throughout the world. With all representatives… Excuse me, did you call me, don Manuel? Yes, Miss. Don Ignacio wants to see you. Please, come in. Come in. Please, close the door. I got the knowledge that you have passed the selection. Congratulations. Yes. Come closer. Sit down, don't be shy. Tomorrow you start working here. With a good salary. I guess you are happy. I'm more that happy and very excited. It's normal, you've done a big intellectual effort. But you must admit your English is far from good. Well, you can improve it. Don Ignacio, I don't know how to thank you for everything. You don't have to. I'm calling Matilde so you can meet and she'll get you started. Matilde, could you come, please? Matilde, I want you to meet Miss Maribel. -You already know her, don't you? -Yes, Sir. From tomorrow Miss Maribel will work with us. Please, put her up to date with everything. Curro, go open the door. Why does it always have to be me! David should go! And who did yesterday? And the day before? That's not true, mum. It's always me. Don't make me stand up, Curro. Must be your sister. -Didn't you hear, Curro? -Okay. -Hello, darling! Is your mother home? -She's in the living-room. -Hello, Teresa! -Hello. I bring the oil you gave me last Saturday. Leave it there. Sit down for a while. I thought it was Maribel. She's doing some tests at her father's company. And I'm very anxious to know the results. Now it's his turn! Heck, always me! Don't make me take off my slipper or you'll both get it. David, go open the door. But don't let Curro touch my cars. Go on, boy. Curro, turn off the TV, we can't talk like this. Never mind. I'm leaving now. But why the haste? Mum, I've passed the test. Hi, Vicenta. Hello. That's great! Come hug me! Of course. She has contacts. Come, David, let your sister sit down. Tell me all the details, dear. You have no idea what a day I had thinking of that damn English test. After the test don Ignacio called me and told me. From tomorrow on I'll work as his personal secretary And this afternoon there was the secretary getting me up to speed on everything. But about your salary, what did he said? He said I'll be well paid. Something else? I don't know. Maybe 14,000 pesetas and the extras. This daughter is really worthy! I'm really happy, Vicenta! You have reason to be. As if you had won the lottery. Maribel, will you buy me flippers for the swimming-pool? Yes, dear. And roller skates for Curro. No. For Curro you buy an English method so that he can start learning. If he goes on like this he'll achieve nothing in life. Let me alone. Will you excuse me, Vicenta? I'll go change clothes. It's really hot. Of course, dear. Have some rest. This is all I have to say for the moment I remain sincerely yours… and my name. I'm sorry for keeping you here so late. but it's really important to send these letters tomorrow. I'll take you home. No, never mind, don Ignacio. I'll take the bus. No, no way. It's my fault so I'll take you. It's the second street but it's no-entry. Leave me in the corner and I'll go on by foot. No. I'll take you home and come up to say hello to your parents. But I'm causing you too much hassle. I'm your boss and you must do as I say. -Good night, Antonio. -Good night, don Ignacio. Come in, please. -I'm sorry you find me like this. -Never mind. Let's go to the living-room. -Let me show you the way. -Yes, of course. Note how they built before: the corridor is bigger than the rest of the house. Come on, children, to your room! Please, sit down. Sit down. I'll call my wife. -Wait a minute, don Ignacio. -Yes, yes. My cars! They are very nice. This one is a Mercedes and this one is a Ferrari. Which one is better? The Ferrari because it has better suspension. Do as Dad said and go to your room. This is my wife. -This is Don Ignacio… -How do you do? You have very good boys. And Maribel is a great help. -Oh, please, don Ignacio! -No, it's not a compliment. She's gotten used to the pace in the office and now she's my primary aid. Maribel feels very happy with her work and with all your attentions towards her. Yes, she is really happy. She is always talking about her job. But sit down, please. Thank you. Have you lived here for a long time? We married nearly 20 years ago. This flat is a little old but we don't pay much. We have considered many times to get another one. To get a new one. But they are way too expensive. Antonio, you should have told me about this. I would have gotten a flat from the company. I've thought of it more than once. But the first bill was too much money for us and I always got down. That's why there are personal credits. Now you can repay even in 100 months. No more talking, Antonio. You have to get a new house. But don Ignacio… I've told him many times. But he hasn't guts for anything. Oh, well, it's very late. I'm leaving. Antonio, you come to my office and we talk about the new flat. -All right? -As you wish. I'm sorry. I broke it. Don't worry, it was loose. At your feet, Madam. Good bye, Antonio. Don't forget what I said. Good bye, Maribel, see you tomorrow. Good Bye. Good night. How many times did you say you would repair the handle? You are a mess! Since you are Pisces There you are, the little gift I promised. Allow me. Do you like it? Yes, very much. Thank you. Oh, it's nothing. Ah, I almost forget: tell your father that the flat matter is already fixed. You'll have it in 15 or 20 days in the next housing release. That's great! May I tell him now? Of course. But as you know, tomorrow I'm going to London. We have a lot of pending letters. Tell them you stay here a little longer. I'll give you a ride, don't worry. As you wish, don Ignacio. I'm calling. You look tired, Maribel. I'm worried, that's all. But didn't you say you'd be late? Yes, of course. But I don't know. I think they'll worry. Why? They know you are with me. We worked for 12 hours and now we're having dinner like good friends. Tough I could be your father. Definitely I prefer being your friend. To be honest, when I'm with you I feel -I don't know- younger. I'm tired of everything. Of this meaningless life. You work too much, Sir. It's my character. I couldn't be inactive. I'm a typical Aries. And I must always be doing something. On the contrary, you Pisces, you are more quiet. Show me your hand. -Can you read hand lines? -Yes, a little. This is the most important one, the line of love. It tells you are a very passionate woman. You follow more your heart than your reason. Am I right? Yes, you're right. And this is the line of life. You'll have a long life, baby. Mine is rather short. One of these days I'll blow up, I'm very old. Don't say that, don Ignacio. And if you keep calling me "don" I feel older yet. I don't find you so old. Sometimes I'd like to be in a desert island and see nobody. I would grow very bored being alone. Well, if you could come it would be much better. But what's the point of wishful thinking? You can't defeat time. You are so beautiful, Maribel. If dos Ignacio calls tell him that I had to go to the bank. Yes, Sir. I almost forget, tell him also that Miss Matilde hasn't come today because her mother is ill. Understood. Good bye, don Manuel. See you later. Hello? Don Ignacio, is it you? How are you doing, Maribel? The trip is a little bit harsh. I'm very bored. Today it's Saturday and in London everything is closed. I miss you. Really. What would you like me to get you from London? Thank you, don Ignacio but you don't have to worry. Please, stop calling me "don". I couldn't do it. You have to. Say "Good bye, Ignacio" Good bye, don Ignacio. Try again: "Good bye, Ignacio" I won't hang up until you say it. Good bye, Ignacio. Good bye, Maribel. What a surprise! You were not supposed to come. Do you think your children don't miss their father during the holidays? Dad, did you bring me the rackets? Yes, darling. Of course. And my hippie T-shirt? Did you bring it? Yes, I did. Be patient, I have presents for everyone. I brought this for you, Maribel. How nice! But why did you bother, Sir? Don't call me "Sir". What did I tell you at the phone? It is difficult for me. No, I think it's very easy. Just say "Thanks, Ignacio" -Thanks, Ignacio. -That's better. Yes, what's up? You told me to remind you you have the investors meeting at 11. Thank you, Matilde. -Will you type that? -Yes. The mattress and the bed go to that room. Children, be careful with the doors. There could be air flows. …it will take along the establishment of the following rules… Don Ignacio, Maribel's mother wants to speak with her. Put me through, Matilde. Here, speak to your mother. Mum? Are you done with the move? I'm glad you are so happy. I'll come when I'm done with work. I'll thank him. I must go on with work. Bye, mum. She told me to thank you. She is very happy with the new flat. So am I. I'm very happy, really. You know, it's nice to make others happy even if just a little. By the way, I have a problem with Matilde. Her mother is still ill and she asked me to let her stay in Madrid to take care of her. I wanted her to come with me to London this time. It's the European builders meeting and since I'll need a secretary I thought you could come. For you it will be a great experience and you can practise your English. That's great! But I don't know if I'm allowed. It's part of your work. Anyway, tell your parents on my behalf. I don't know. You say it's all right but Maribel is still a child. And you are too suspicious. You always imagine the worst. You know? He who sleeps catches no fish. You mean you don't care what could happen to her? "What could happen". Don't be so dramatic! You have always been a chump, Antonio. Your daughter is not a child anymore. Besides that's the first thing he asks us for. And he has helped us too many times. All right, do what you want. But I don't want to have any responsibility in this matter. Always the same. But don't you understand she is a fully grown woman? All right, all right. Grant her permission. -Do you like that? -Yes, very much. We get in and you ask for it in English. You speak, but don't use signs. I don't know. Besides my pronunciation there's the problem with the dishes. They are all very strange. Come on, go, don't let this gentleman wait, that's not right. Sorry Sir, we want to have… (in English) To start up order a dozen oysters for both of us. Yes, Sir, right away. (he speaks Spanish) Are you telling me you are Spanish? Yes, Sir. I'm from Toro, Zamora. At your service. Please, speak English so she can practise. All right, Sir. (In English) We want a dozen of… "ostras", how do you say? "Oyster", Mademoiselle. (In English) Thank you. A dozen of oysters. All right. And then? And then… we would like to have… Give me. I'll do it. -(in English) Then bring to us the special French pate. -(In Spanish) Yes, Sir. And to drink? -Some Bordeaux 1969 will be all right. -(In Spanish) Right away, Sir. Pardon me. I wouldn't dare to have another drink. I could get dizzy. I'm already tipsy. That's the good thing about Champagne. It goes to your head a bit and it makes us forget everything. To you, Maribel. To your youth and beauty. Let you be very happy. Can we see the show? Ah, yes. It begins now. But if you don't like it we can leave. Night has just begun. Don't be shocked. Here in London this is very common. It's done even by students to pay her studies. - - These Englishmen are very lazy! They could have taken the boxes up here. I'll go into your room and leave them there. Here! Oh, it's destiny. Why don't you put it on? I'd like to see how it fits you. What? The blouse we bought this afternoon. I'd like to see it on you. It's a little embarrassing. What are you saying? Embarrassed by me? Please! All right, wait a minute. How does it look? Just wonderful! Ignacio, please, I… What's the matter? I don't know. I shouldn't feel anything. Please, let me go. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid, I'm leaving. I admit I didn't behave right. No, it's not that. Yes, I was expecting too much. Forgive me, I don't know what I do when I'm with you. I think I've fallen in love. Don't say that. Yes, let me speak. Since the first moment I feel for you something I haven't felt for years. Something I thought I'd never feel again. I know I shouldn't love you. I'm a fool. I had some illusions. I'm sorry I've found you so late. But Ignacio, don't say that. Age doesn't matter. The thing is… Yes, I know. I know everything you're going to say. I have a family, some obligations. You are young, you have your whole life to live. Let us forget everything, as if it was a dream. When we get back to Madrid You'll have to get into another section of the company. Because if you are near me I could go out of my mind. And I don't want to harm you at all. Forgive me for loving you, Maribel. But I just can't help it. Good bye. I love you too. Ladies and gentlemen, in a few moments we'll be landing at the airport Madrid. Please fasten your seat belts and do not smoke. Once we've landed remain seated until the plane has stopped. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, in a few moments we'll be landing… Maribel, if it isn't too much trouble go out by the rear exit. I know it's silly but they are waiting for me and so it's better, don't you think? As you wish. Ignacio, are you going to sign the bills now or later? I beg your pardon, Miss Maribel? I mean, are you going to sign the bills now, Mr. Eurastegui? I'm sorry, It's been my fault. In front of other people you must be careful how you speak to me. We must be very careful. It's our secret. People gossip too much. Maribel, you are little more than a child. I have a complete life. I have responsibilities. I understand. I won't happen again. What do you do? Do you come or stay? You'll have fun in the country. I always go with you but I told you, I'm meeting some friends today. We'll be back about eight. Don't you think, Antonio? If we get the train at seven. -Come on, boys! -Bye, Maribel! Enjoy yourselves! Bye! The most important thing is for us to be prudent. If people find out it's over. I don't think we've done anything to… No, it's not because of you. But the other day… Don't you remember? You called me by my first name. Matilde is a clever girl and though she is discreet something could slip out of her tongue and… My concern is not about me but you. You are very young and it could hinder you. Do you understand? Yes, of course. I understand, Ignacio. I thought we could meet whenever we want in a nice flat I lend to foreign customers when they can't find a room in a hotel. There we would be all right. Without worrying about people watching us. Whatever you say is all right for me. What are thinking? Nothing. You must be thinking something. My stuff. Your stuff. Come on, tell me. No, really, it doesn't matter. It's just nonsense. I'm concerned about all of yours. Come on, tell me. I was thinking about your wife. My wife! Yes. You see? No, it's okay you talk about her. It's just a little annoying. I should have bring out that matter. But we'll never talk again about that. -Do you promise? -I promise. I can tell you we don't think things over. I shouldn't have married her. Our relationship has passed away. Love, if ever existed, has gone. Then why don't you get a divorce? It isn't that easy. Apart from ethical reasons, children, social circumstances… that catch and confine you like a spider web. Besides, getting a divorce is inconceivable here. And me, do you think I shouldn't get married? Of course. Why not? But you'll have to choose the right one when the time comes. Think about it quietly, coldly. We must be happy any way. We must live the present. Life is so short. Everything is so unfair. We, for instance. Why do we have to hide? Why hide our love? Yes, but at least you are not alone. My situation is worse. Yesterday I was alone all day. But you have your family. I saw you yesterday coming out from church and you looked very happy. Don't dramatise, Maribel. You'll end up weeping like all women do. I have enough of that at home. I don't need more from you. I'm sorry. I won't bother you again. That's better. But no resentment, okay? Come here, kiss me. Do you want to go for a walk before going home? Yes? Yes, don Ignacio. No, Sir. There's nothing urgent. All right. Bye. Was it don Ignacio? Yes. I told him there's nothing urgent. Time goes by so quickly! Do you want to join me for a light meal? What if don Ignacio comes and asks for us? I stay. Don't worry. He won't come. He is having lunch at home with some friends. Another couple. You come? Then I'll go with you. Wait a minute. Don't Matilde, darling! How nice to see you! How are you doing at the company? Very well, thanks. You look as pretty as always. This is Maribel. This is Esperanza, she worked with us. Nice to meet you. You work together? Yes. How is your business? It goes fine. But working hard. Well, I'm leaving. I'm in a hurry. Bye! Give them a kiss from me. -Nice to meet you. -Bye. Who is she? Esperanza? She is crazy but she's lucky. She worked as a secretary for don Ignacio. The same job as you. And why did she leave the company? Well, she had an affair with don Ignacio, there was some scandal. Yes, I wouldn't tell you if it wasn't true. Everyone in the office knew it. But she was judged guilty because Esperanza -you've seen her- is one of those people who can't hide anything. She had to leave the office. Don Ignacio helped her to buy a boutique that she manages very well. Don Ignacio bragged then about his conquests and he could indeed. But come on, eat something! We are going to be late. Thank you. Good evening. Don Ignacio Eurastegui, please? Yes, this is the place. What do you want? I have an appointment. I'm journalist. You know, "Big men today". My name is Carlos Maltrana. Oh, yes. You have an appointment at 5 o'clock. Wait a minute. Don Ignacio, Here is Mr. Maltrana. The journalist that has an appointment with you. -Tell him I'll be with him in a minute. -Yes. Please, wait for a moment. Of course. Fine, really fine! Everything is so nice. Everything is arranged tastily. But the nicest thing here is you. No, don't thank me. I say it because it's true. Do you know that I'm going to be a millionaire? No, of course you don't. Well, when I'm a millionaire I'll hire you. It must be great just pushing some buttons and having them bring you this and that. Because now I have to do everything by myself. Yes, everything. Miss Maribel, he can come in. -You can come in. -Thank you. And remember: as soon as I get rich I rise your salary, okay? I'm calling home to say I won't have dinner there. Yes, I'm going to be a little late. I'm having a drink with some friends. Business matters as always. Yes, don't worry. Bye. But I have to go. My parents get angry easily. Then do as I've done. Call them. I don't know. My father could get angry. He's been very worried lately. Since Ignacio doesn't get angry let it be him who suffers and bears all, isn't it? Just say that you have work to do and you'll come a little later. As you wish. Don't complain because I always do what you want. Mum? It's me. I'm going to be late. Yes, extra work. Yes, I get paid. Don't worry, I have the key. Well, see you later. Bye. That's better. You're learning. Come to me. Ignacio, what am I to you? What? You've heard me, what am I to you? You are simply the most important person in my life. But come here. Until when? What do you mean? Why do you ask that? Because someday it will end. I wish it never ends, if that's what you wanted to know. I now I'm asking you: what's come over you? I'm talking with you. Is that wrong? I think you are hiding something. And if there's no trust… It isn't that. Come on, tell me. Don't be a liar. What's the matter? Who is Esperanza? Ah, that's it. Finally. But who told you that story? I don't think you should call it so. Just to call it somehow. But envy is always there. In this country love is forbidden and therefore you must hide yourself and hide everything. Why did it come to an end? Maribel, you are too young and there are many things you are not aware of. It ended as many things in life: because. Honestly, I'd have to squeeze my memory. That was something trivial. Nothing important or serious. as our relationship. At least for me. And she, what did she do afterwards? Esperanza has always done her will. If she hasn't got married is because she didn't want to. She is a really independent girl and has what she wants. Perhaps because she can't have anything else. Don't think anymore about those things. You have to live the present, I can speak from my experience since I've lived more than you. But smile. Drink a little. Smile, as if you were photographed. Maribel, you are wonderful. To us. Did you see? A perfect dive, wasn't it? Yes, but get out. We have to go. No, not yet. Let's stay some more. If you Do as she says, laddie. I can take that you don't remember me. But you should remember your future boss. That can't be. -Of course I remember you. Carlos… -Carlos Maltrana. -My name is David! -Nice to meet you! -Will you introduce us, David? -Yes. What's her name? Maribel. He is my younger brother. The older one is getting dressed. This one is very desobedient. We should have already left. I was going too. If you want, I can come along. All right. David, help me gather our things. -We meet at the entrance? -Yes. See you. We always have to leave at the best part. Curro, get the bag and head for home. Tell mum I'll come later. Okay. Bye, children. Bye. Where do you go? I go to Generalísimo but I can take a taxi. I go to "Plaza de Castilla". Then you can leave me in the corner of "Alberto Alcocer" Okay then. When will I see you again? I don't know, now I'm working full time and we go to the swimming-pool every day. Great! Then we'll meet there tomorrow! Bye. See you tomorrow. What have you done today? Nothing. I've been in the swimming-pool until now with my brothers. Then a man has given us a ride. It's a man I met at the office a few days ago. He interviewed you. Ah, yes. An impertinent lad, I remember Don't you mind if I get out with boys? Why should I? I think you have to go out, have fun. Aren't you jealous? Don't be silly. Of course I am. But only where there's a cause. And this is not the case, is it? Seriously: as I said before, I think it's better for you to go out with boys of your age. It'll be good for you and good for both of us. So nobody will notice our affair. But that means you don't care much about me. You just don't fall in love. Going out and having fun is okay but going too far is a different matter. I think, I don't know… I think you don't love me anymore. Don't speak nonsense. Of course I love you. I love you more and more. Come on, go! "…and tell mum I'm coming", but this is going to take you some money. Go now if you don't want me to get angry. This is a men's thing. Please, allow me, Maribel. Here. Two "duros" for you and one for David. And tomorrow I'll buy you something at the pool, okay? -Okay. Bye. -See you tomorrow, Carlos. They are good boys. Did you enjoy? Yes, we had a great time. Mostly they. And you? I think I'm going to fall in love with you and that's old-fashioned, isn't it? Yes, it is. But then comes reality. You know a girl, you like her a lot, perhaps too much and… You are pulling my leg, don't speak nonsense. No, that's true, I like you very much. If you want, we stop dating and so danger is over. No, don't joke about that. If you keep talking like that I'll leave. You act like a child. All right, whatever you say. But mark my words. If some day I say I love you and that I can't live without you… Let's see how you react. I'll try to remember that. Do you promise? I'm leaving, it's very late. But we have barely talked at all. I think we have. Bye. May I kiss you? The give me your hand. Let me go! Just a little more. No, I must go, really. All right. Fool. See you tomorrow. Do you want me to come tomorrow? No, we'll go by ourselves. See you there. Bye! See you! Eh, Curro! Hi! Hi, Carlos. What's up? What happened? Why weren't you at the pool? Because my sister is in London because of her work. And when is she back? The day after tomorrow. Do you know at what time arrives the plane? I don't know. If you find out you can earn 10 "duros". Deal. In advance. Call me on that number. If I'm not there leave a message. All right? All right. -Bye, Curro. -Bye. Curro told me you came with this plane. Curro is a busybody. But I don't mind. I'm glad you came indeed. Here. Look what I've brought. Do you like it? How kind of you. Of course I like it Put it there. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. It's not much. Maribel, I've missed you a lot these days. Don't exagerate and keep your eyes on the road. Yes, Sir! Look! Even your work is messy! And why is that? I'll tell you! Because you go out every day with that… nobody. You said to me yourself that I should go out with anybody. Yes, but not like that. I'm not a fool, you know? I'm sorry, Ignacio But I'm with him like what? If there's something I can't stand that's excuses. Come in! I'm sorry, don Ignacio, could you sign down some letters? When I'm done with this one I'll do it. Let nobody disturb me, I want to finish this for once. Yes, Sir. This man sometimes just drives me crazy. Where were we? Oh, yes. Let's leave it for now. I'm very tired. Look, write those texts adding my corrections. All right, right away. Shall I call don Manuel? Yes. Did you have fun? Yes, I did. But I think I don't like this. Definitely I don't. Sometimes I'd like the bull to win. And I think it isn't right calling something so cruel "a feast". At first I guess I also though like that. Now I don't know. I don't have an opinion. You see so many things that you don't know how to judge in the long run. What happens is that you've become dull from too much writing. I'm paid for that. Not much, but I'm paid. Apart from bullfighting, what do you like the most? Well, roast beef, red wine, white bread and you. Can't you be serious just for once? I'll answer to you. My likings, of course. Music and cinema. And you? You are a Pisces in every aspect: sensitive, romantic, passionate… Aren't you? Yes, I am. But answer me, and you? If you insist I'll answer. I'm conditioned too by my zodiac sign: Taurus. That is, love. And don't laugh, 'cause this is as serious as your likings. I like music too. How long will take to get to Madrid? Not hour and a half. What happens? Is something wrong? No, it's just that I'm a little tired. Why not? Because. Leave me alone. I love you, I'm sure of that. Perhaps it's not meaningful to you. But I really love you. Please, Maribel. No, leave me, Carlos. Don't you like me just a little? It's not that. We are friends. I can't tell you whether I like you or not. Honestly, I haven't even thought about it. But I want us to be friends. It's getting late. Please, Carlos. Perhaps it's a topic but it is true: no one can understand women. Just a kiss and we're going. Can we go now? It was easy, you see? Hi! There's that little brat again. It's very late! Who do you think I am? Answer me! Listen carefully: Those laddies just think about taking advantage. For them there's no responsibility or love. Well, there's love, but the free type. You're wrong, he does love me. I'm sure about that. But I'm not so sure that I deserve it. And what about me? Do I not love you? I've been neglecting my work, my family! And perhaps you're not sure that I deserve your love either. I'm aware of that, Ignacio. You are not aware of anything! You, youngsters just care about yourselves. You'll never know all I have done for you. What's the matter? Nothing. I just don't think it's fair. Now you say that? You don't think it's fair? Yes. I don't like that I must always hide as if I were a murderer. I'm getting fed up with all your nonsense. Have you forgotten what I told you in London? I told you our love was impossible. You surely have forgotten too that I suggested to get apart and you didn't want to. I'll never learn. All this is because I'm an idiot. Okay, you're right. Don't get angry. "Okay", "you're right"… I'm not a puppet that you throw away when you want, do you get it? Now I'm in charge! I love you, Maribel. Hi, Maribel. -Have you been waiting for a long time? -No. What's wrong? Because I know something's wrong. I want to talk to you about something important. Go on. Let's see. Who's dead? No jokes. If you don't mind, I'd rather go. Here you can't talk. Waiter! We'll go wherever you say. You should have told me before. It's true that there was nothing between us. At least nothing official. It's not that. I couldn't. I've asked you to forgive me. That wouldn't fix anything. But if you insist, I forgive you. If you don't mind I'll take you home. Did you finish the article? No, I got distracted. I'll have it in 10 minutes. No more, you know the guys in composition. Didn't you exaggerate a little? I don't know why are you constantly looking. He's not coming. Come on, get the last bath. We're going. But before that I want a coke, then a bath and the we go. But hurry up. -Me too. -You already had one! No, I want one more. You stay here. Else you'll quarrel again. -I want a coke! -Why don't you go? All right, I'm going. -Then I'll take a bath. -Right away! What do you give me for an information? What? What do you give me for an information? Curro, I'm not in the mood. Take a bath or else we go. I'll start gathering the towels. It's worth a "duro". Carlos is at the entrance. I'm getting dressed. And you too. I've left your towels there. Don't keep me waiting! Seriously, Curro, is it a joke that of Carlos? No, it's true. I don't trust you. Hurry up! Look, that Carlos' car. Yes, I see. And that over there is too Carlos' car. Walk, Curro. Darn, you're touchy today. There's no talking to you. That's his car and I saw it. Waiter, the change, please. I'm in a hurry. Maribel! Curro! It's me, wait! Hello, Carlos. Why haven't you come? Hi, David. I've been on a trip but I'm back. Great! Was I right? You women are boring. How are you doing? Hello, Maribel. Hi. I can give you a ride. Please, get in! Okay. Where have you been? In Canarias. Those are some beautiful islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Have you been in Tenerife or Las Palmas? You're very clever, Curro! In the South of Gran Canaria, making a report about Scandinavian tourists. Can I talk to you? Will you… Yes, of course. I know you have a quarrel. Come, David! -I'll come right away! -Yes. Okay. I stop there. I've been thinking a lot about you about us. And about what I'm going to say. Forgive me for the other day. I was an idiot. The really important thing is that we love each other. And I do love you. I need to know if you love me. I had to tell you, Carlos. I love you too. Don't cry, my love. Don't cry. I'm going to leave the office and look for another job. I'm glad you say it. I'll help you find it. I have some friends from the journal. We'll search. But don't you see it's foolish? And all because of that boy you don't even know. Wait at least one year! I told you I'll work somewhere else. And everything will be the sane until I get married. But don't you understand this house and all we have we owe it to don Ignacio? And a loan we had to take. And until now he pays every bill? Think of your brothers since we are nothing for you. Or all the burden we've gone through for you. She's saying the truth, dear. We owe him a lot. I only want your brothers to study, not to be what I am. And you know how much college costs nowadays. But Dad, do you know what that man has done to me? Do you want to know why I got that job. Tell me, Dad. Do you want me to tell you? No, I don't want to know. Dear, do what is right for you. You mother will get over it. Now let's go to bed. It's very late. I've decided to end with this. But before that I wanted to talk to you, Ignacio. Then speak. You can say what you want. Yesterday my parents told me about the loan. And they are afraid that you take the flat back if I go. Ignacio, I've never ask you for anything. But now I do, for them and for my brothers. You are going to ask me to give them the flat. And that's it? No. Let me finish, please. I only want that you facilitate the payment. I was giving all my salary at home. Now I'll give it to you to pay you. But leave them alone, please. What if I don't? Answer me, what if I don't? What if I'm not good and do what you ask? Answer me! You alone take decisions that affect your parents and me without asking for our approval. You decide doing this or that and that's it! You, youngsters need some discipline or you get lost. Now listen to me! Though you may not believe it what I'm saying is for your own good. Everything is going to be as it is now. At least until the loan is paid back. And don't forget my businesses end when I say so. Be patient. You just let me do. And before you realise everything will be fixed for you and your family. And meanwhile I must keep having sex with you? Exactly. Carlos. I'm sorry if I didn't call you to say good bye. Yes, my love, to say to you "farewell". I haven't the guts, not even for that. To tell you that our love can't be. Since you probably are wondering why I'll tell you: the same as always. Because of the damn money. Forgive me. Please, don't try to see me. I want you to forget me. The sooner you do it, the better for both of us. With this letter I explain it all. I want you to know the truth and to forget me. Everything is just my fault. I must pay for that. If you really love me please don't try to find me. Good bye, my love. Maribel. Get down! Bye! Good bye, Maribel. This program wants to contribute as well to the homage that Onaindia club will pay tomorrow to that renowned constructor whose name is Ignacio Eurastegui, by rewarding him with the gold medal to business merit. The medal has been purchased by his own employees. Several important people will be there from the domains of art, literature and finance. Other news… -Hi, mum. -Hi. -Hello. - Hello, dear. Hello, Antonio. You go to wash your hands. I've just heard the news? What news? The medal to don Ignacio. Here, mum, your invitation. I go to my room. Come back in a moment. I've been thinking all day long what are we going to wear. Because I have nothing appropriate for a party like that. Well, can we eat? Yes, I'll go get it. I'm hungry. My meal! Thank you, my friends. Please, applause for these wonderful boys. And now while I work they can have a deserved rest and take a drink. Days like this help us to go on with the same drift and illusion we had when we started some years ago. Days like today, yes. Because today, ladies and gentlemen, I feel really touched when I behold one of those infrequent things in the world we live in. That's why when we were summoned by this event we answered in the same way with a common feeling of acknowledgement facing those so uncommon virtues, I say, which are honesty, intelligence and generosity. Those are the virtues of great men without whom society, strangled by completely different feelings, would be held and tied by their deadly poison. That's why I ask: what would be progress, science, what be humankind without these great men? Before you there's a true example of what I'm saying: Ignacio Eurastegui! Buh, everything's a lie! You've drunk too much, let's go or they'll kick us out. Leave me alone, man! And he is to give continuity to my humble words. You know I'm talking of the president of the Onaindia club. So well-known by all that it'd be an offence to introduce him to you. Please an applause to Alfonso Onaindía! Thank you, Pepe, you are the best. Thanks to you, Alfonso. Plain hard work and raw products. Friends, I cannot add anything to the words of Pepe Martin, but just this: though the club I lead proposed this homage to Ignacio Eurastegui, it is you, my friends, who have made it possible with your support. Otherwise it would not make any sense. Nor would this medal have any meaning that I, on behalf of each one of you, will have the honour of placing on his chest. Ignacio, please. Accept it as a small recognition to so many merits you have earned and above all as a symbol of something very moving: the love of all your subordinates in the face of a common cause, of your wonderful command, of the orders of a man of good will. Lies! That man is despicable! He has an affair with his secretary, Maribel Garcia. And he is blackmailing her with some money he lent to her parents! Out! You are not welcome here! How funny! Dear friends! Dear friends, after the words of Alfonso Onaindia there's been some mischievous criticism by someone who seems not to have seen his desires for wealth fulfilled. Bravo, bravo! Let's forget this incident that I am the first to deplore An incident which anyway has no entity. Yow know what they say: People talk, therefore we must be doing something right. My dear, what are you going to do? And now let's go on because that's our motto: "always forward". And I can say today this year we increased the number of our operations taking the lead over the competitors. The competitive schemes that the consumist society imposes upon us today are strong. They sharpen our senses. They make us strong and invincible. But it is also true that when we fight as a team and when ww fight for others that go with us, then, I say, we are invincible. Our future is clear but only if we don't bow down before anything if we devote ourselves/> to a process of constant improvement. If our target is high enough so that we can never reach it. Maribel, will you forgive me? I love you.
