Under the angel's feet he made a crag of ruby. The crag had no base. Under the crag he made a bull endowed with 4,000 eyes, ears, mouths, tongues, nostrils, and feet. But the bull had no base, and so under the bull, he made a fish named Bahamut. So immense and dazzling is Bahamut that the eyes of man cannot bear its sight. The tail goes on that beneath the measureless fish is a fathomless, and sea beneath the sea an abyss of air, and beneath the air lay fire, and beneath the fire are the six hells. - Oh, oh, shit! Amir! - Whoa, whoa, what is this? Hey. - There's somebody out there? - What the hell's that going on? Babe, I don't see anybody. - What are you doing? We weren't properly introduced this morning. My name is Amaru. I'm a Amancaya's brother. I run operations for the foundation. - That's right. No, no, no, Amancaya mentioned you. - This is my, uh- - Yeah. I know. Pleasure meeting you. - Your, your English is good. - The one thing I do better than my sister. Oh, this is a Americo, one of the locals here. There's this transnational company that, that found gas in this area, and we've been trying to organize the, the, the community to stop it. - Well, we saw you earlier. I'm terribly sorry. - Are you busy? - We're just about to have dinner. - Eat later, I wanna show you something. I think you'll like it. So this is a traditional celebration to welcome the rain, the fertility, and good fortune, right? You know, 'cause we've had a harsh year. - Sure. - Oh. This, this is singani. Man, you ready to try some good shit from Bolivia? - Oh yeah. - This is gonna be so fun. All right, it's gonna be all for you. - Sweet. - There you go. - Oh, let's, please. Did I say something wrong? - No, I'm sorry about him. You know, locals right now are very wary of foreigners. We have a bad history of people and companies coming and trying to take advantage of our resources. You know, take advantage of our property. That's why Pachamama defends itself. And you always offer something to Pachamama. if you wanna take something back. But if Pachamama gets angry she likes blood. I'm kidding. No, man, go ahead. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. I'll get you something real special. - Okay. - Yo-hoo, hey! Amancaya is here. - Hey. - Cheers. - Oh, right. - Right. - Amancaya. - No, no. - You got it. - Amancaya, Amancaya. Amancaya. - You all right? - No, I, I had this dream, it was, this woman in the kitchen and there was this bull. I, uh, I haven't been honest with you. Uh, I, um, I used to have these dreams, um, these vivid dreams. Uh, because, um, when I was a kid, my, my mom shot herself in the kitchen and, uh, um, my dad blamed me for it. He said, "I could have done something." And I was just a kid. I was just standing there. I, I thought that the dreams had stopped. I, I thought I'd gotten past it. And then I met you and I thought you would think that I was crazy or that I was damaged if I told you any of this, and so I didn't. And things were going great. And then now of a sudden I'm having these dreams again. I'm scared of losing you 'cause I, I, I, hell I don't wanna be alone, and I, I don't wanna disappear. Please don't leave me. - It's okay, babe. It's probably just the alcohol and the jet lag. - Probably just the alcohol and the jet lag. - You know, this can't be a reality right now, right? - Amat? Buenos dias. There you are. Been looking all over for you. That guy with the bull is in the courtyard. You see him? That guy gives me the creeps. - There's things to do places, to go. - The water factory. - Hell, yeah, let's go. - He's gonna be leading the way with his machete. But he's always with his machete so be careful. - Marco. - Just playing with you guys, he's the best. - Sweet. - This is great, huh? - He's amazing. - And it's just the start of it. You know, this trail was actually built for schools. - Wow. - Because with how much knowledge they can get of, of this native forest, you know? - Wow. - You'll see. - I think I wore the wrong outfit. - Amaru, how high up are we? - Um, we're around 7,300 feet above sea level. - Wow. - Yeah. Oh, this is the most important thing. This is the purest water you'll ever see because it comes from inside the mountain. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow. Oh, my god. - You can actually drink it. - Really? - Yeah, you should try it. - I'm good. - Mm, that's good. - Yeah. - How is it? - Not bad, not bad. - All right, now we're gonna really dig into the forest and see some native stuff, which is gonna be great and excellent. - Gosh Babe. - Huh? - What are you doing? - Jumping in. - You know how cold this is? - Come on. This is the most important part of the tour. Get in. - You're gonna catch a cold. - Time to get in. - You're crazy. - Come on. It's warm. - Yeah. Believe when I see it. You're a mad man. - One thing that many people don't know is that birds have a very important role in the forest. For example, they eat the seeds from the two most important trees of this forest, which is the guayabo and the pino del cerro. And if you realize they're everywhere, guayabo, pino del cerro, guayabo, pino del cerro. - Wow. - What does birds do? They eat the seeds. So in their stomach, they mix together. And when they're flying around, they defecate, and that seed from that seed, it grows two trees, but with one root. I call it the magical bird effect. - So it's a poop forest. Cool. - Oh, there's another guayabo and pino del cerro. You know, the root- - All right. - Has a specific function, which is, imagine you have a, an empty glass with a sponge inside. - Sure. - When you pour water, this sponge absorbs it all. - Right. - And now imagine this water is rain. When there's no more rain, this sponge starts releasing it to all the aquifers of the world. - Gotcha. - That's why we have a water all year long, you know? Oh, this is a perfect example of symbiosis. Two trees growing and working together. One has what the other one doesn't and vice versa. It's, it's like they, they cannot live without each other. They need each other to exist. - Like yin and yang. - Yeah. This foundation was, was born as an initiative to protect the forest. - Sure. - And then we started a specialized greenhouse to grow and reproduce the local seedlings that were lost to this tragic fire that we had in 2017 here. - Right, right. - And for instance, there's guayabos all over the place here. There's, there's some pino del cerro there. - Oh, may I? - Sure, sure. And you know, this fire consumed 13,000 acres. So this fire consumed 13,000 acres. Took the life of hundreds of animals. And three people. Took the life of hundreds of animals and three people, including my mom. - I'm so sorry to hear that. She's beautiful. - She was the main activist, the brains of this foundation. She was my hero. And Amancaya's too. She was my hero and Amancaya's too. - Where is Amancaya? - She was always busy. Sometimes she does so much it seems like there are two of her. Sometimes she does so much it seems like there are two of her. - Wow. - So this is where all the water that he has produced. It's mind blowing. So trees have two main functions. You know, the first one is this sponge that I told you that retains the water, and then it releases it when there's a drought. - Right. - And the second one is, is being the cycle that generates water and rain. You know, that generates forest, the forest generates the evapotranspiration, the evapotranspiration generates water, you know. We're sure there's a confirmed theory that this clouds are rivers. They're just rivers above us, you know? And that's this, this is what we call the, the horizontal rain. And that's why the world keeps getting water. And that's why we wanna show that this is a water factory. You know, without this little thing I'm talking about, the world will run outta water and we're all gonna die. - And these are the guaybo and pinos, no? - Si, you got it. I honestly think the fire was not an accident. - What makes you say that? - Well, foreigners, greedy corporations, they just come and start burning everything. Don't care if there are animals. Don't care if there are insects, they don't care if there's life. For instance the guayabo and pino del cerro are not good for wood. So the easiest way to get rid of them is to start burning them, and planting trees that gives them business. It becomes a business. - Now how long did it take to put the fire out/ - Weeks. - Babe, let's go. What you working on, babe? - A story. - A story? - Uh-huh. - Hmm. I thought I was the writer and you were the pretty one. - Oh. Can we not both be writers? You see me as competition? Think I might be too good. - You couldn't possibly. - You have no idea. - Oh yeah? - Mm-hmm. - What's it about? - It's about a woman who shoots a bull in the face. - That did happen. - Ah, that it did. - Bring your wine. I'll be right back. - Baby, what are you doing? - I'm gonna get a condom, I'm gonna get a condom. - Condom? - Yeah. - Babe, it's me. - I know it's you. We haven't met together for a while. - Don't trust me? - It's just a condom. It's just a condom. - Hey. You actually brought condoms, I can't. - Amro? - Watching me sleep? - You're handsome when you sleep. - How long you been up? - You know me, I'm a early riser. - Hmm, I can see that. - I could get used to this. - Me too. - Mind if I take a bath in your tub? - It's our tub, remember? Hurry back. - I will. - Hey, there you are. - If you wanna fuck other guys, at least have the decency to throw the condom wrappers away before you have me over. - What? - I mean, I know we're not a thing or whatever, but I, I just. - Babe, those are from last night. - I don't care who you fuck honestly, just don't flaunt this fucking shit in my face, okay? - Those are the condoms that we used last night. - Stop it, Amir. - You brought the condoms. - I don't wanna have this conversation right now, okay? I, I'm gonna go out. - What? - I'll be back later on. I don't know. - Where are you going? Hello? - Hello, Amir? - Yeah, this is him. Amancaya? This is so strange. No, I, I just, I had a dream about you last night. - Wow. Are you okay? - Yeah, no, I'm, I'm fine. How are you? It's been ages. - How are you? - I'm okay. Better. I'm still here in upstate New York writing, you know, doing my thing. Really? No, that sounds great. Of course. I'd love to see you. - Si. - Bahamut's fame reached the wastes of Arabia where men altered and magnified its image. From a hippopotamus or elephant they turned it into a fish afloat in a fathomless sea. On the fish they placed the bull and on the bull a ruby mountain, and on the mountain an angel. And over the angel six hells, and over these hells the earth, and over the earth seven heavens. Hi. Never believe what happened today. Got some really good news. - Good for you. - Don't you at least want to hear about it? - Sure. - Okay, listen, so my friend Amancaya calls me today from Bolivia. Okay, she runs an environmental foundation in the rainforest, the Bolivia rainforest. - She calls all the time. - What? - No, I haven't heard from Amancaya in years. What are you talking about? What's your problem? - Nothing. - This is an opportunity of a lifetime and you're acting like you don't even care. - I care. - I was gonna invite you. - Look, I, I honestly don't know what you're talking about. And I just wanna have a glass of wine and go to bed, okay? - Fine. Have your wine. - What the fuck? Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my bed! - Whoa. - Get the fuck out! - Amat. - Listen, get the fuck out! - Hey, hey! - Who the fuck are you? Get out of this house. I'm gonna call the cops. - What are you talking about? - Get out! Who, who are you? - Babe. - Get out! - Amat. - What the fuck? Get out. - Amat! - How do you know my name? Seriously get out. I'm calling the cops on you. - Babe! - What? Get out, get out! - Babe. Babe. Hey, Amat, open the door. Babe, come on, open up on. Amat, if you don't open up right now, I'm gonna break down the door. You're handsome when you sleep. It's all right. It's okay. Shh, it's okay. It's okay. Amat. Amat. Amat, it's me! Amat. Amat. Amat. Babe. Amat. Babe. Where are you going? Amat. - Amancaya. Amancaya, Amancaya, Amancaya. - We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and dial again. - Babe, what are you doing? - Jumping in. - You know how cold this is? - What? This is the most important part of the tour. Get in. - Amaru, listen to me. I need your help. Amat is in the forest. He's lost. He's lost. Amat. He's in the forest. - Who, who you looking? Who you looking? - Amat. My boyfriend. - Ah. - What? Amancaya, where is Amancaya? - Is he here? - Excuse me. - I need to come in. - Who are you? - Listen, I really need to come in. - Who the hell are you? - He should have told you. He needs to tell you himself. - How do you know him? - He called me last night. He said they were coming and I know exactly what that means. I really need to come in, okay? - You're, uh, you're? - Oh shit. - Come in, there's a bathroom down the hall. - Yeah, I know the way, I've been here many times. - How do you know Amat? - He will tell you he comes back. I promise. - What does that even mean? - Any minute now. - Oh, my god, Amat. Babe, where you been? Amat, talk to me. What happened to you? Please. - Amir. - What's going on? What is this? - I need a moment with him. Please. I need you to step out for an hour and come back. Okay? - What is she talking about? - Amir, listen. - What is she talking about? - Do this for him, hmm? - You want me to leave my own home? - It's gonna be fine. Come in, have a seat. Go ahead. - When I told you, I hadn't been honest with you, uh, I had told you a bit of what had happened, but not all of it. And um, I, I thought that I could show you or tell you, but, um. - Can I talk on your behalf? You were diagnosed with schizophrenia when you were 21-years-old. This is part of your family history. You've been in and out of therapy for many years. I've been your therapist for a while. Recently you stopped taking your medication. - It's 'cause, 'cause we met and I, I thought I was getting better. I thought, uh, I don't know I thought I- - And you start drinking alcohol. - We were going out. We, we were having fun. I don't know, I thought I'd move past it. I thought I was getting better. I don't know. And then all of a sudden these nightmares started and I started acting out, and I feel like I'm ruining this for us. - How can I help? - Right now, if you really love him, you have to let him go. - There's the clinic I need to go to. Just to get better. - No. No, no. I'll make you better. I can make you better, all right? He can't, no, nobody knows him, but me. He needs me. Doesn't need a clinic. I can help you. I'm going to help. Trust me. I love you. I love you. I love him. - I know. I know, but this needs to happen. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? That's it? - What? - Are you just gonna throw me away? Huh? You're just gonna like, I'm, I'm an imperfection in your perfect fucking life. Is that what it is, huh? What all of a sudden, you're just gonna throw me aside and, and make me disappear just because this person comes into our home and, and says, that I have a fucking problem? Huh? What, what you just take the easy fucking road all the time? - No. - All the time. That's what you do. That is your thing. Take the easy road. You know what? Go fuck yourself both of you. Take your fucking notebook and get the fuck out. - Stay with me. Amir. You know, this can be a reality right now, right? - Yeah. - Please don't do this. - This is for your best. I'm very proud of you. I'll be in touch. - I speak English. Amro. - Hi. - Hi, nice to meet you. What brings you to Bolivia? - I'm a journalist. - Wanna get out of this place? Come on, come on. - Are you okay? Are you okay? - Hey. - Sorry, this, this was a mistake. - We didn't do anything. - Excuse me, can I help you? - Sorry, I lost my keys. My wallet. - Is everything okay? - I just don't know where I am. Babe, what are you doing? You know how cold this water is? You're gonna catch a cold. Time to get in. Whoo. Come on, it's warm. Ah. So immense and dazzling is Bahamut that the eyes of man cannot bear its sight. On the 496th night of the Arabian nights, we are told that it was given to Isa to behold Bahamut, and that this mercy granted Isa fell to the ground in a faint, and three days and three nights passed before he recovered his senses. The tale goes on that beneath the measureless fish is a fathomless sea and beneath the sea and abyss of air and beneath the air lay fire. What? What's going on? Please. Just put that down. Amancaya, put the gun down. I don't understand. Amancaya. Don't! - You said you never leave me. - I come here every week. He's not answering. - Yeah, we've been here before, ma'am. - Sir, sir, can you hear me? Huh? Have you taken anything? - Is he taken any meds? - Yeah, yeah, he's a Benadryl. - Stay with me, okay? Sir, can you hear me? Stay with me. Stay with me. We're gonna get you some help, okay? We're gonna move you now, okay? - Si. - Amancaya, Amancaya. Amancaya. Amancaya, Amancaya. Amancaya. Amancaya, Amancaya. Amancaya.
