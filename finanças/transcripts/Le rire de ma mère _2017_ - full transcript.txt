- You turned the music off? - I hate it. There's no quicker road? It's long and ugly. Whatever. It's the only road, sorry. - Can't his dad have him? - It's my week. We had a weekend alone. Alone in the country? I'd go crazy. It'll do him good to get some air. Look, he's so pale. As if I cared. It's good he knows you. He never speaks! I even thought he was a mute. Never a word. I'm not into blended families. What are you into? Except being a drag? What? Get out! Get out! I don't need a prick around. Come on, move. Get out. Get out. It's my damn car! Cut it out now! You're right. Keep your shitty crate. Good idea. Adrien, come on! Hi, it's me. Can you come? We have a problem. Here we are, Romeo and Juliet in their carriage. Hi, Dad... Get in. How are you? What happened? A prick happened. Too bad, his 4x4 was handy. Don't pretend you liked him. I thought it might work out for once. Hi there. - How's it going? - Fine. Don't sulk. Let's go! Like the good old days! Hit the road, Jack! MY MOTHER'S LAUGH What are you doing? You're not late? I like to be early. Adrien... My little love... Hold on. Hurry... You OK? Still can't button your shirt. Hold on... You're late. Get into position. Bow. Hajime! - He'll murder him. - With that giant, he's had it. I can't even see Mathis. Matte. Face to face. Your mum has a crazy laugh. Bow to each other and sit down. Adrien, Elsa... Get into position. Let's go. Let's work on osoto gari. In motion. Bow. Hajime! Matte. I didn't see much motion. Valentin, Kader. Your turn. Let's go. Face each other. He has it for sure. - How can you tell? - My dad's face. If he smiles, it's really bad. If he smokes, the guy's done for. Bingo! See that? Lucky guy... Here, American classics. - Had a good day? - Yes. - Any grades? - Yes. And? What? Call this a dad-son conversation? Tell me stuff. Ask me how my day was. Understand? Taking an interest in others means asking them questions. I have a question. Just one? It's a start. Why did you leave Mum? It's complicated. All right... Tell Gaby I'll be back late. I'll be right there! Like others watching you on your PS4? No, it makes me lose. I'm the same. I like to paint in peace. The Christmas tree... Can we do it? Of course, no one's here. Let's go! Let's try it now. Start walking... There, that's it. Enroll instead of watching us. She lives here. You're hot for her, huh? Bullshit. Mytil... Ty... Tyl... Tyltil. What is that? The characters' names. Mytil... And Tyltil. Brilliant... Carry on. - Sleeping? - And you? No, I'm talking to you. Who's Maeterlinck? Is an acting workshop a good idea? Hold on. Your dad. Marie, it's me. How's it going? Adrien wants to learn some crazy play. Shit, he's lost. He chose the acting workshop. You're so hard-line. Come on, we're there to help him. No sense in arguing. You deal with the acting, OK? I'll put him on. Hold on, Marie! The oncologist's on the 24th. Yes, I know. Bye. - Dad? - Yes, son. I may not manage it. Self-confidence is the key to success. We'll learn it together. OK. All right. Make an effort, OK. Love you. Can I sleep in your bed? Again? Adrien... All right. You're one short. I don't need it anymore. Remember, it's two poor children looking for the Blue Bird. - Why? - For its magic powers. It has magic powers and can even cure diseases. Let's go. I need the Blue Bird for my sick daughter. What's wrong? Louder. We don't know. She'd like to be happy. Know who I am? You look a bit like... We can't hear you. ...our neighbour, Mrs Berlingot. Start again. It has to be better. All right? Are you OK? How do you feel? Hello. Can you sign the discharge? Yes... Mother's signature What'll you do? Are you brave? No. I'll cauterize a little vein in your right nostril... to stop your nosebleeds. What's 'cauterize'? Cauterizing a wound is like keeping a bad memory away. Will it hurt? Close your eyes. Being brave means renouncing the easy way. And recognizing that things aren't always fair. If you take your courage in both hands, you feel less vulnerable. I came about a nosebleed. All done. Why's she here? Think he'll rub your mum's tits? Shut up. Excuse me. Adrien... This is a video club, not a game arcade. Can you turn it down? Hey, kiddo... All right... Respect the rules. - Where're you going? - Mum's. Why are you here, honey? I came to see you. You have a kid? - You have a kid. - Yes, I have a kid! Are you asleep? Are you mad at me? I'm sorry. Sometimes, I feel lonely. You've got me. Of course... You're my little man. But you'll never be Mum's lover. Good for you, I'm not easy-going. Is that why Dad left you? Think your dad's easy-going? Does love mean you have to argue? When you stop arguing, you stop loving. Napping? Aren't you off sick? - I am. - And? Give me a break, Mimi. Marie... Review next week's schedule. Book a flight to New York on the 5th. Send Rose a birthday gift today. You choose. Maybe a Dinh Van jewel. You gave her one last year. I was at Chlo√© earlier. I reserved a bag she'll like. Your test results? Fine. I'm in shape. Good. See you later. Imagine a tiny ball of fire and warmth in your stomach. It's spinning round. It's red, yellow, whatever... It keeps moving around your body. Now, it's moving to your right thigh. It descends bit by bit. You can see it. It'll soon reach your right knee. Let's try again. OK? The rest of you, lie with your eyes closed. I really need that Blue Bird. No one's looking at you. Matteo, lie down. Go on. Bye, everyone. Bring your documents next week. Stay here with me. Goodbye. It's great you come here but, in five classes, I haven't heard you. Even though it's simple. Acting means a troupe. We're together. We need to advance, but you block us. You disrupt the group. Here's what I suggest. Do other workshops where you're more comfortable. Maybe it's not for you. Adrien. Tidying the whole store? Sulking much longer? You can't understand. Really? Why not? Carine says acting's not for me. Adrien... What did you expect? She took you even though you won't speak. See, you can't understand. Can you help me here? Which one leaves no mark. - One saves the planet. - Shit... Another one too. Screw the planet, I want clean windows! Come on. Leave the trolley. Mimi, it's me. Busy this weekend? And Mathis? Mind if I drive? Well, boys? Happy? We have school Monday. Adrien, try to relax for once. You'll be back in time. You're so serious. Look! Look at this! A live one! In it goes. At the bottom. Adrien! I put your cockles in. There's a little worm too. Go on, boys! Go on, Mathis! Go, Adrien! Go on, go for it! On the left! Let's go now! Here I go. Your mother! Corner! Not bad... Let's eat, Mathis. I'm hungry. That was that lady's house. She minded you when you were little. Remember? Yeah... Mussels, fries and Coke. We're nearly there. Then, the teacher says, 'Ghislaine, show us America on the map.' Ghislaine says, 'OK.' She knows where it is and shows us. The teacher asks, 'Do you know who found America?' And all the blonds go, 'Ghislaine did!' That's funny. - When did you arrive? - This morning. - For how long? - We leave tomorrow. - A short little trip. - It's short, yes, but... ...he has class on Monday. A theater course. In any case you are always so pretty, always so beautiful. - Stop flattering me. It's true. Isn't your mum pretty? He doesn't need to say that. He should. OK then kids, what are we doing this afternoon? - Going shopping. - Shopping? Hang on, wait for a minute. What was that dumb idea? Don't ask. I'm asking because I don't get it. You're back at work too? I didn't bother to tell you. Isn't sick leave to let you rest? You think I want to rest? I just worry about you. Take me there? Give me that. Romain, solitude isn't my thing. I want to go for drinks, I want to be in the sun, I want to smoke, I want to talk loud... I want to feel alive, see? Alive! Why have you stopped the meds? Here we go again. I haven't stopped them all. Only one. Why? I don't need it now. Look, I'm not stupid, OK. See this? I know what it is. No. You know nothing. Every day, at the same time, you take the fucking pills. Every night, you get up to follow the treatment. A break does you good. Will it do Adrien good? Come on! I'm not dead. I pull through, right? Besides, there's Gabrielle. I have to go. I'll pick him up Friday, OK? Adrien, what is it? The Blue Bird. What blue bird? Sit down, please. Quiet, everyone. Elsa, please... Six! Avenue de Breteuil. Got it. It's my turn? Mum says you want to be a doctor? Is that new? To treat cancer. - Playing, Dad? - Sorry. Five. Chance. Let's see. 'Drunk in charge'. Fine: 20 euros. You know Mum has... I know. She told you about it? Playing, Gaby? Adrien, it's a serious illness... Not now, Dad. You need to trust in children's resources. They have incredible powers of adaptation and energy. You must talk to him, of course. But playthings down. You must be able to say the word 'death' by putting it into perspective. You follow? But... how do we do that? For example, over dinner, you can say, 'You know, Mum's ill. It's serious. People die of it. But until they die, they live.' 'Until they die, they live'? Exactly. Like that. Innocuously. 'Until they die, they live.' Go on. Until they die, they live, like. Something wrong? Yes... No... I just wanted to say that until you... until you're... How was school today? OK... Dad? Can you learn to become brave? Learn? Maybe you are already. Why do you ask? I want to act like Mathis. He isn't afraid when people watch. You have other qualities. Yeah? Such as? A lot of imagination. That's no use. It's a means of artistic expression. Plus you're resourceful, curious, kind... You don't get it. I want to act. You don't like it. Not in front of people. I never heard of acting not in front of people... - Hi. - OK? - You? - Fine. Come on. Think we'll see it again? Pity you left the workshop. It's 'cause of Carine. You give up when they say you can't do a thing. Come on. You never defend yourself. Put your hand here. And this one here. Like that. Try to make me fall. Don't get too fond of me. I never keep friends long. Why not? Mum and I move all the time. That's sad. I'm used to it. - What does your dad do? - I don't have one. - Everyone does. - I don't. You'll think about acting? Yes, Patrice. As soon as I get back. Myriam sent me the files. I'll be out soon. I'm fine. After a few zapped neurones, I'll be up and running. Thanks. Take care. Killing my love life? It's the best I found. What do you think? Not a thing anymore. What a drag. I'll take this one. Ignore him. I like the Seventies perm style. - This is better. - I love it. Adrien may not like it. I'm going for a smoke. Don't let him come. He mustn't see this. Tell me if I'm pushing it, but I'd like to spend Christmas with you. I can't face my parents. Mum's compassion pisses me off. I miss Adrien. I'll ask Gabrielle. I think she'll agree. I miss you too. Look... I'll tell Gabrielle. I think she'll be pleased. You jerk... It's for games. It's no, conversation over. Fancy dress? Not at all! It's too flashy. At least you'll get spotted at night. I like the pink lady side. - You're so... - No, you're beautiful. It's great! - I like it. - Just a sec. - Don't bother. - It's OK. What next? Here you go! Young and old. OK? - Are you happy? - Yes. I'll wear the pink for school. To you, to your freedom. It'll be tough without you. Patrice is going crazy. How did you last 20 years? Stamina, Mimi, stamina. Let's spend next summer together. Good idea! If Gaby and Romain agree. I'm planning to rent the house next summer. - Your parents' house? - Yes. Some legacies are a burden. Don't make me cry. Delicious, Gaby. Romain made everything. You don't cook? It's not my thing. But you cook all right. Let me talk to Gaby without butting in! Let's tidy my room. I'm interested. See? Try to relax tonight. Another? I didn't come here for a lecture. But if Romain agrees to dance with me, I'll put it out. I don't want to. Come on! You must remember this! Come on... Don't be jealous. He'll leave you too. I'm kidding! It's strong stuff. - A little. - Just a little. Isn't Gaby a bit weird lately? Everything OK? Yes, excellent, thank you. She doesn't drink much. Isn't she a bit boring? It's not simple for her. No... - It can't be easy. - What? What isn't easy for her? Well, all this... The situation. - Not an easy situation. - What situation? She has it all. My man, my son... As far as I know, I'm the one dying. You're not wrong. Shut up, Mimi. Illness doesn't give you privileges. What do you want to hear? Come on, tell me. That we're splitting up? That I can't live without you? Is that it? I'd feel less alone. You've never been alone, Marie! Shit... Oh, sorry, I forgot... No one can understand you. That 'boring' girl looks after Adrien when we're at the hospital. With the store and all the chemo, I can't manage alone. Your illness is something we share. It must be the meds-booze mix. It makes me a bitch. All right... I'm off to bed. What did you dream? Imps attacked me on the beach. - Imps? - Yeah. What were they like? Red, with horns. - OK? - Yeah, and you? - Wash your hair. - After breakfast. - Here. - Thanks. Are you OK? Romain's at the pool. Yeah? He never swam with me. Like father, like son. Romain's like that, huh? He's pernickety. A stickler for rules... Doesn't it bother you? No. He can be a drag though? I'll leave you. I bet you've heard his grandmother's knife thing. What's that maxim of his? 'Bad knives cut fingers, not wood.' I've heard that one. 'The knife's been in the family 50 years. Don't you get it? ' It's not dishwasher-proof. Wipe it with a damp cloth. So the blade doesn't rust or the wood rot. Or with time. He's a pain with time. Stop it. To put at child to bed at 8:30, he has his bath at 7... Dinner is ready at 7:30, he cleans his teeth at 8, and has his story at 8:15. The only way. As everyone knows, a tired child... is a tiring child. And I'm so messy... - Divide and tidy. - And tidy. Learn to share space. Exactly! That sweater on the chair... Are you exhibiting it? It's been in the same place for five days. So I was wondering. Five days? Too long for me. You're a family of obsessives. No, I just like things to be tidy. Don't let him be too hard on Adrien. Sorry about last night. I'm glad you're his stepmother. Here's what I've written, Mum. Seeing: Receiving images by sight. Looking: Training sight on. I put they're written differently. I need you for the rest. Nearly finished? Who're you talking to? You. I thought... Are you OK, Gaby? Yes, I'm OK. It must be something I ate. Everyone vomits here. You can go. Vomit House! Seriously, leave me be. It's not funny! This is Vomit House, Gaby! My mother was Queen of Austria. The women of my life resembled my mother and my memories of her. And I, Louis, carried off by the passion of youth... Everything OK? What's up? What are you watching? A boring film... So why watch it? We wanted to be bored. Funny... I'm bored too. Isn't it time for bed? Adrien's already asleep. I feel like I'm your kid. How about some booze? Shit, Romain... You're so grouchy. How do you manage? She manages, OK. Does that suit you? Sleep well. Who are they all? They're children's joys. Can we speak to them? It's no use. They sing... Hold on... 'They sing, they dance... ' Take the time to say it, but keep your voice low. It's no use. They sing, they dance, they laugh, but they don't speak. 'All mothers are rich if they love their children. None of them are poor. None of them are ugly or old. And when they seem sad, a simple kiss, received or given... can turn their tears into stars in their eyes.' Adrien's glad to be going to yours. When do your parents arrive? Tomorrow. You leave right away? Yes. Bring Adrien for his next holiday? Of course. How do you feel? The sea will do you good. A baby brother or sister? We don't know yet. Will it change things for me? Some things will change, others won't. Like what? Well, you'll be a big brother. You'll teach him or her things, be a role model... You'll share a room and toys... You'll have to watch your stuff! And what won't change? What won't change is our love for you. Come on in. You can sit there. Want one? - Who is it? - No, don't say a word. Can I tidy your studio? - I have to do it now? - Get it out of the way. Elsa's waiting. It's your mum. - Hello, it's me. - OK? Yes, I'm OK. - Wait. - Put Adrien on. He's right here. Here... Hello, it's Mum. How are you? I'm fine. What're you doing? My homework. Is school going well? - Yes? - Yes. And the acting? It's OK. - You'll come for the holiday? - OK. What a conversationalist! I'll call back. Love you. Bye. Sit up straight to work. Go on. Past historic of "avoir". J'eus, Tu eus... Hopeless. - We haven't learned it. - Sure. It's true! Shut up, OK. Stop moaning. It's a useless tense. - Says who? - My mouth! Use your mouth to say more intelligent things. But I guess that's too tough. Too tough, is it? Adrien... Come on... You never believe me. I do believe you. I try to learn, but I just can't. I'll help you. We'll do it together. Some kids read stuff once and know it by heart. Life isn't fair, Adrien. If it was, we'd know. Until you realize that, you'll find things complicated. Want to see my dress for the show? Mr Time, leave me! Impossible, only 394 seconds left! - I'd rather not be born. - No choice. - I'll arrive too late. - I'll be gone. Carry on. - I'll lose her. - We'll be alone. See Life about all that. I don't know about it. Come now. No, him too. Leave her! She won't die, she'll live! Come with me. Just let her go. Started the Blue Bird set? It's in three months. It's good to plan ahead. Don't worry. Nothing too flashy, OK. I want to be discreet. So ask someone else. It'll be more original with you. Original, but not too original. Exactly. You've got it. Do I have to go? Mum's waiting. I want to stay here. That's not possible. What's up? I'm coming. There's no need. The journey will wear you out. You haven't told her. - Give me time to... - To? Well, to... I'm ready. - What's this for? - I'm taking my savings. Why? It's only one week, not a lifetime. What if there's a fire? The knife like this, so you don't hurt yourself. Pull on the beard. Hold the mussel... Pull hard, there's a lot of it. Look what I found. It's Zouzou. It's been ages. Mum, look! You remember? We took him everywhere. My baby brother can have him. Well? Managing, Adrien? Yeah. Congratulations. What for? - For... - Gabrielle! Yes, Gabrielle, we heard... The baby. That's good. It is. We're very happy. You too? Beautiful, aren't they? There are a lot this year too. You're better than me. Adrien's scraping away... I'll fetch Adrien next week. I tried to tell you... I wasn't able to. Off you go. Give Gaby my love. How was your week? It was OK. She sleeps all day. The rest of the time, she smokes or yells at us. It's tiring. Children shouldn't live with their parents. Adrien, fetch your mum. No thanks. She's better here with you. How long will you stay? As long as needed. Thanks for the house. You can call it home. How's the store? The store's a war I wage. I'm still holding out. We're more or less fossils now. But I like it. - How are you? - OK. You'll catch a chill... Cut it out! For fuck's sake! Stop doing that. I don't care if I'm cold. You could feed an army. It soon goes. We won't eat a baguette each! What does it matter? Get your strength back. That's it... That's what annoys me. That's it. - Marie... - Just stop! Calm down, please. I'm perfectly calm. I just don't understand. I don't understand. What, Marie? You're quite a consumer too. I don't spend my days at the hypermarket, pushing a trolley like an old woman, wondering if I need one baguette or five. You piss us off! Get lost if you're not happy! You get lost! She'll get upset now... That's why. What? You asked why I left you. That's why. For a baguette? Right, call me stupid... No, it's for all the excessiveness. All the words you can't hold back. The hurtful words. One chemo session... Just one chemo session. You pissed me off for that. I was there the other 47 times. I was there 48 times! 48 times, I went. So spare me the recriminations! You're unfair. You know what I'm like! You know! I'm like that. I get mad and I yell! And I love you. Still. I know. You could've forgiven me. I'm sorry. Keep that to yourself. You have to prepare Adrien. How do you tell your son his mother's going to die? I can't answer that. But I know you'll do it right. I never noticed we were so high up. It's like jumping into the void. They have an expression in Quebec to say, ' I've had enough.' They say... 'Time for my trip.' For Gaby. I'm afraid you'll forget me... Adrien and you. Living with people, you forget them. Not when you see them less. And when you no longer see them? Adrien, your mum's going to die. She fought, but the illness was stronger. You'll have to be brave. There'll be tough moments, but I'll be there. Gabrielle will be there. At what time? Thanks, Armand. Are you OK? Will you cry at her funeral? No. Good. I hate seeing you cry. - Can I tell you a secret? - Yes. You won't tell anyone? I promise. My mother has died. So what'll we do on Wednesdays? Can I invite Elsa to Mum's funeral? Excuse me. It's not a party. You don't just invite people. It's for friends and relatives. Too bad. I'd have liked to. Shall we? Your mum's funeral is ace! Good night, Mum. Good night, my love. A bit much? - Don't you like it? - I do. Help me move it. Take the middle one. Swap them round. Thanks. Is it clearer now? - Camembert? - OK. - Don't mind us! - I have basketball, OK! We were here first! It's OK, Fatty can wait. - Seriously? - No, you wait! A dead mum doesn't mean special treatment. Go on! Yes, Adrien! Can you turn the heat down? - It all goes in? - Yes. All right now... What happened? Another dad-son conversation? You can talk to me. We're both the modest type... But we have to change. He spoke about Mum. - And? - That's all. You're not going to cry? No, it's the onions. Try this on. It looks hideous! Still see that blue bird? No. Are you OK? Sure you're OK? Usually, your parents tell you stories. Today, you're telling them one. It's normal to feel scared. I'm scared too. But it'll go well. We've worked all year and I have faith in you. All right? Let's go. Breathe. Do what I do. When someone scares me, I imagine him naked. Imagine the audience naked. - Mytil... - Tyltil... - Are you asleep? - And you? No, I'm talking to you. Is it Christmas? Not yet. Tomorrow. But it won't bring us anything. What's that? It's Dad! Do you have singing grass or the Blue Bird? Our grass doesn't sing. I did like Mathis said. I thought of something. That's a reason. Where is the bird? I thought of Elsa. Her long, brown hair. It's not blue enough. Find me the one I need. I thought of my pocket money. My summer by the sea. I thought of my little brother. Of my room I needed to tidy. I thought of my mother's laugh. And that... That worked.
