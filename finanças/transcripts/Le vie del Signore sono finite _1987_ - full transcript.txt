"Dear Prof, as I did not receive any answer to my previous letter... "' "'... I am still talking you about Camillo Pianeses case... ' " After his girlfriend left him, he couldnt move his legs anymore. "' All the medical tests are negative but Camillo is still paralyzed. "Even though the patient says that he doesn?t love her anymore?."' "? maybe theres still a link between the end of the relationship.,"' "... and the sickness" 'Maybe Camillo has a psychosomatic disease" '... as he's suffering both in his mind and in his body" "Should I study it deeper?"' "The patient is coming back from a pilgrimage to Lourdes. " "Isnt he hoping for a miracle in order to be cured? ' He says that, if your legs are sane, then your mind is not. This is all about the unconscious. This is the new cure. - What is it called? - It's called unconscious. This is how he calls it. Unconscious means "in the mind". I think that is what it means. He makes lots of questions. He asks me what I dreamed... ...and I tell him my dreams. He asked me if, when I was a child, something scared me... ?and I told nothing did. Hes behind me... ...and asks me some questions. Sometimes I turn back and he tells me to look straight. I asked me if I ever run away watching my parents making love. I answered that I saw them... ? but I never ran away, I watched them on purpose! I was a young boy, and young boys do this kind of things. WHISTLE This is Leone, my brother. Hes my travel companion. We have the same father. When my mother died, I went to a boarding school. - So, the second mother married dad. - The first father. - Right. The first father married the second mother and Camillo was born. - Then Camillo fell sick. - My name is Orlando. - Nice to meet you. - He is Orlando. - Orlando. Orlando is born at San Giorgio del Molo. - He lives near us. - We live at Acquasalubre. We dont live in the upper side, near the spa, but we live in the lower side. - In the lowest side. - It looks like we live in the catacombs! The village is slant and we live... I said in the lower side because up there there are the spas - Right, but the village is straight. - Lower - Ok, lower! My brother has some manias. What are you writing? Since I came here, you have been writing. You are writing short sentences. You write two words and stop. What are you writing? Poems. I see. Can I ask you something? Are you intelligent? - Are you intelligent? - What do you mean? There are intelligent people and ignorant people. I am asking this because I see that you can read and write. I dont want to be offending! Did you get my question? Yes, sure. I can read and write, but its not enough to be intelligent. I dont want to brag about, but I can read too. Read?. I can manage, I am not that good. I never read, I dont read books. Its useless to start reading now. There are too many books and I couldnt read them all. I am reading alone, while therere many people writing. I can read a book, they can write millions of book! - The weather is getting worse. - Whats your point? - Nothing, just the weathers bad. - Don`tt interrupt while we are talking. Madam, when will we arrive to Rome? Around 11.00. - Are you from "'the upper side"'? - What do you say? - Are you from North Italy? - I am from Veneto. - Infact your accent is..., - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Dont worry. You are nice, intelligent, good... You should ask it first. - A poem has some effects. - Nobody is interested into my poems. I am interested. Leone, are you? - Do you want to listen at Orlandos poem? - I do! - Its just the two of you. - Don`tt worry! When you start reading, everybody will listen at you. Attention, please! From this moment on..., Stop! Attention! From this place... ...a poem will be read! Its a poem of Mr Orlando. Its a new poem. It has been composed in the train for you. - You can start. - The sea inebriates me... - Wait, Say it properly, say it aloud! Stay upright and look at the people listening. Give them satisfaction. Start! The sea inebriates me with his noise. - Is it finished? - Yes, it is. Is it already finished? This is the true meaning of a poem. The poet writes the beginning of a the poem... ...and who listens puts an end to the inital idea. Its very nice and they didn`tt get it. This is a wagon of ignorant people. Fanny, wash your hands. Good evening. Thanks, Bernard. You can serve. Tomorrow I am meeting some friends of mine travelling to Rome. - You should meet them, Vittoria. - Fine. They will arrive around 11.00, At 11.00 I must take Fanny to dance lesson. I am sorry, Bernard. It doesnt matter. Its the last time I am lying to cover your lies. Why, after all? So that you can meet the barber? Poor Bernard! The Lord sent him to you and you waste all for that barber, Such a nice girl like you! I am going to marry Bernard! - See you, then. - Fine. Come and see me at the saloon. It is called "Pianese', - Water! - Thanks. - Any water? - Yes, please. - Take a glass for Orlando. - Can he drink water? - Yes, he can. - Its called 'Pianese', - Take the bags. - Yes. The saloon is at nr 7 A, you cant be mistaken. You must not lose your hair, your skin is weak, - What? - Your skin is weak. But your hair are strong. You can try the lotion that I have invented. - Bye, it was a pleasure to meet you. - Same for me. - Goodbye. - Ill visit you. - Fine, bye. - Is he going to visit us? - Yes. - Why? - Hes an intelligent friend of mine. May I come in? - Hi. - Hi. - What about the trip? - It was fine. People from all over the world, unbelievable! We couldnt talk because we couldn`tt understand. We italians were all on one side... ? and we were talking between ourselves. The first day we saw the sanctuary. we went back there the day after, sitting all in a row. The mess was in the main square, and we started to sing, Mary let me in into your heart... Vittoria, do youknow this religious song? - Do you know it? - What? - This song. Mary let me in into your heart. - I dont know it - Neither do I. Everybody sang without reading. They knew the song by heart. Maybe its a famous religious song. Then the volume of the song went up, Mary, I bring you into my heart, let me in into your heart. Everybody was touched and was waiting for something. The song finished and we left with no miracles at all. We were disappointed, we expected it. When we were singing we were thinking: "'Here comes the miracle"' Vittoria, are you listening? Yes, I am, but... I must go home to meet Bernards friends. Why didnt you say it before. I am talking alone like a stupid, you make me sing "'Maria, I bring you into my heart... " Can I ask you something? Do you really love Bernard? Yes, I do. Bernard is the man of my life. My parents and my friends like him, hes a nice person, elegant... How can you like him? Hes so different from me. - How can you like him? - Thats not the point. If you were engaged with me, that means you liked me, It doesnt mean you should have stayed with me forever. You could have found somebodyelse, but like me. Not a "'fair hair guy"'. Do you remember what you said? I dont like the fair hair guys. " "'Fair hair guys are not interesting, they are fake. " Then you leave me and get engaged to a 'fair hair guy". - Bernard is not a "fair hair guy', he is blond. - Is he blond? - Exactly, hes blond. - Is he? - Yes, he is. - Lets go away. - Leone, can we go away, please? Leone, be quick, we must to to the blond guy! Otherwise hes going to hate us more than what he already does. He doesnt hate you. You want to be hated. He didnt forgive you about the dead rat. Again the story of the dead rat? I had just got engaged to him and you sent him a dad rat by mail. It wasnt me, Vittoria. - Can you swear? - I swear it wasnt me. - Can you swear on your father? - I can. I swear I didnt send him the rat. There we are! I open the saloon and take the bags. Be quick,Vittoria has to go. - Theres a letter for you. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Italians, damned murderers! - Vittoria! - Vittoria? - Vittoria? Did you close the gate? Shouldnt we meet at the men`ss toilets? - Did you close the gate? - I did, I looked for you all over the spas. We had to meet at the womens toilets. - Are you sure, wasnt the man`ss toilets? - No, it was the women`ss. - I am not stupid! - You dont listen to me. - I said at the womens toilets. - Fine, you are right. - What is it? - Oil dip. - Are we eating oil dip? - Yes, we are. You should cook spaghetti with garlic and pepper. You know I like it. - Bernard is away this week, shall we meet? - I cant. My father wants me to solve my sisters problem. You could be one of my fathers patients. Again with that story? Do you think I should stay with sick people? - What do you mean? - I mean..., - Bernard! Whats going on? Who is he? - Nobodys here. - Shut up! I forgot my coat on the chair. Who was he? - Fortunately you closed the gate! - I closed it. - Did you leave the window open? - I didnt open anything. Why should I have done it? - Miss vittoria? - Whos that? - A patient of Bernard, Are you walking around the closed spas? - He saw the coat. - I knew. My jacket! This time Bernard will break the engagement! This woman walks around the spas during closing times. - You left the gate open on purpose. - I closed the gate! I didnt know this woman was in. Go and check what she is doing. - You did it on purpose! - Ive already told you I closed it! "Camillo says he saved a man from a fire,.,"' "'... and he got paralyzed for this heroic gesture. "' "'Camillo is looking for peoples attention, with this lies. " "'As a child he pretended he couldnt walk in order to be carried around. " "'His sickness is a way to attract attention. "' 'Camillo asks with his body what he cant ask with by spoken words" - You mean to kill us! - Mum, this is my life. - You said you would talk to Camillo. - I will do that. - I am sure he will understand me. - See how he treats his own parents? We understand too, but we have all the rights to get worried. Dad, dont worry. Ok. You are always right. - Help me to get out of the tub. - No. - Why not? - I dont feel to. - What? - I dont feel to. - You don`tt feel to? You are going to leave to be a missionary! Can you imagine what youll find, over there? Youll find sick people, contagious people. Youll find unknowns disease, and what will you do then? Will you say: "I dont feel to?"' Then, you`dd better not to leave at all. I am going to cure real sick people! You are not sick, can you understand that? - The doctor told me you are psycosomathic. - So what? If youll meet a tribe of psichosomatics, will you let them die? Answer! - Cant I be psychosomatic? - I`lll take the chair. Good so, take the chair! Psychosomatic... Since I am psychosomatic, I should stay here inside! Its a sickness, in any case. Camillo, this time is different from the other times. I dreamt the Virgin Mary! I even saw her and I talked to her. - Did you talk to her? - I did. - Did you asked her about my legs? - I didnt. - I thought you would. I felt something inside that convinced me. She said: "'What are you asking for? What makes you so unhappy?"' "'What do you need? Just tell me, and Ill give it to you. "' You should have asked her just one thing, "Could you do something for my brother who sits on the wheelchair? ' I wasnt expecting that. She said: "Many people need to be cured and you can help them. "' In that very moment I took my decision. I can tell you just one thing: Good, do what you want. - Good morning, Leone. - Good morning, Armando. - Do you need something? - No, I dont. Do you? - Nothing. - Anything. - Nothing! - Maybe I can help you. - We dont need anything. - A new armchair? - We dont need anything! - Fine. This man is a thief, everybody knows it. - This is crazy! - I am not coming out of pity! - Why are you coming, then? - I am coming because... Its useless talking to you. You know something? I prefer to pick up Bernard at the station. I am not coming anymore. Ill go away, so you are happy. - What happened? - I dont know. - Whos she? - A friend of Camillo. - A woman? - Sure. - Do you want to put that thing on my head? - This is not for you. - Its for Camillo`ss bath. - That thing will damage his skin. - Yes, but its good for him. - That lotion is pure acid! - Its good for him. - If he`ss happy with it... - Everybody`ss happy then. - Leone? - Coming, just one moment. - Leone? - Im coming! - Im calling you. - I am here. - Can you go out? - Sure, lets go. - I will open the door. - That solution is pure acid. - Yes, its really acid. - Shall we go? - Whos that girl? A stupid girl. A real stupid girl. I was engaged to her for three months. At the beginning she said always: "'I like you so much!" 'I like you physically because you have dark hair and eyes. "' - You know whos her boyfriend now? - I don`tt - He`ss a "fair hair guy'! Thats incredible! Lets go to take a photo,now. This photo should evidence your hair before the cure. Did you understand? After the cure well take another photo. After one month well go to Rome... ...to show the results. I can also bring something against the pain. It doesnt matter if it is acid. Ill become a famous inventor! Shall we go? - Lets go to the photograph. - No, you stay here. He can do it by himself. I want to do it too. - I can push. - I know. I dont want anybody pushing me. - I can push also Orlandp. - Can you push us both? We can do it by ourselves, we dont need anybody. You stay here and take care of customers. Good morning. - This is the photograph. - You can pick your photos next week. - Come in. - Orlando needs a photo. - Shall I put on my coat? - Yes, with the coat is better. - Help me. - Come here. Let me see. Take a posture and turn your head. Dont worry, you can show that you don`tt have hair. The photo must show the improvement obtained. - People should see the difference. - Can I buy a " straw hat"'? You dont understand me! What have I always told you? The hat is the hairs enemy! Do you understand? I will buy it in Rome, after the cure. After the cure you can buy all sorts of straw hats. Do you know the spas straw hats? I know. Now you look there. Be serious. Dont move! Ready... Im doing something crazy, Fanny. These are hairs! - I dont like them! - They are fresh, I`vve just cut them. - They are an old mans hair. - I can give them to you for 4 comic books. I cant put these witch`ss hair to my dolls. Dolls dont play witches? It was a good deal. I have black curls. Here they are. But for these ones, I want six comic books. - Lets make four? - Five. - Fine. - Deal. - How many are they? - Three. - Give me the last two issues of may. - Fine. Hi, Leone. - Good morning, Camillo. - Hi, Fanny, - This is for you. - What are you dancing? - Its a surprise. - Are you coming to see me? - Would you be happy? - Yes. - Would your sister be happy? - I think so. She said you must wear a tie. Listen, Fanny?, If I come, would Bernard be happy? Bernard went back to France. They had a fight and they split up. What do you mean they split up? They split up! They fought because of you. Bernard knew that you went to the spas with Vittoria. My sister defended you out of pity. He got angry and said that you sent him home a dead rat. Which dead rat? I never sent him a dead rat. Fine. He said: "'If you defend him, then you still love him. "' She was shaking and said: "And so what?"' He answered: "Enough! You passed the limit!"' - Then he left. - And then? They sent me to bed. - You didnt hear anything else? - No, I didn`tt. Good! You shouldnt listen to adult`ss conversations. On the snowy border the morning is rising, Din don! A far awaythrill is announcing Christmas. Din don! Camillo, maybe it wont be easy for you. bUT I can`tt do this. I cant use tricks with women. I prefer to pay them. - What are you talking about, Orlando? You are too much honest. - "'Din don"'. Shut up! If I could write your poems... ? how many women would fall in love with me. You can write and speak well. You can use these tricks. The stranger at the border, din don! - Can you understand? Snowflakes, snowflakes. You should invent new words. - Do you know what I did to Rosa, the photographers daughter? - I cried. - Why? - I didnt actually crie. I faked. I said: "'This is a sad world and I am sick"'. "And it is even sadder in my conditions. " She was touched and took my hand. Then she said: " Unfortunately you get better only if you suffer. "' I had to control myself not to laugh. Just think about that sentence: "Only if you suffer?" I like to pretend to get touched. - The only thing left is lying. - To who? - I dont know. Camillo, dont exaggerate with the lotion. - Your arm is cracked. - I know, dont worry. - Did you invent it? - No, you did. - So, I know how much I need it. You play the poet and find the words. - You should be good at telling lies. - Who should I lie to? Nobody ever loved me. - I want more to fall in love than to walk. - What? I dont think you can replace the ability to walk with anything else. Especially if you live alone. On the contrary, Camillo has a brother like me. - I took care of this wooden pieces for years. - Put it down! - Leone, put it down. - Shut up, please! If he says it, its one thing, if you say it, it`ss different. - I dont agree with your ideas. - Leone, what... - Shut up! - He didnt say anything. - He said: "'Put it down!"' - He shouldnt have said it to me! - Fine. He can say that to his brother, not to me. lo voglio dire che lui, da quando siete amici, vi frequentate. Since you are going out together, he doesnt need me anymore. - He never said that. - He did. This is not correct. He cant do without me, but he can do without you! Thats enough! Go away! - I am sorry... - Go away. - Illusions are disapponting! - Leone, would you leave? - I will. - Go away. - I am. - Talk to your friend. - Go away. - Why is he so angry with me. - Hes not angry. - Its not the first time he reacts this way. - Don`tt pay attention to this. - His jealous. - I am sorry about that. He noticed we are friends and talk a lot. He reacts like that because he would like to stay with us. You should stop thinking that nobody loves you. First try, and then see if thats true. You never say anything. Say something! Tell lies! Whats the woman of your dreams? I dont have one. To me it`ss important just to be loved. What kind of woman do you like? I dont know. I`dd like a blond. With blue eyes and nice hands. Sensitive, intelligent, understanding without talking. Nothing else. Shit! Nothing else? To be your ideal woman, you need seven women at once. Thats your ideal woman? Just look around! Tell some lies. Whats up? Maybe its too windy. Lets pull the sunroof. - Anybody around? - No. What did you see? Leone, look. Did you see? This is the potion! Did you see? Does this mean that you dont need me anymore? Leone, nobody must know about this. - Especially Orlando. - Do you still need me, then? Sure! Lets go away. "'My patient is healed. " "Hes healed hoping to see again the woman... "' "'... that he wished to meet again. "' 'She left Bernard. "' "'Camillo approached her and obtained the attentions that he needed. "' "'Hopes can be more effective than medications. "' "'You dont give me any hopes and my only perspective... ' "... is to work in my fathers company. " "'Everything could be different, if I could pursue psycology studies. ' "'I would be one of the tops in Italy. "' I am feeling so bad! Camillo! Vittoria, come here! Stop! This is my brother and I will push him. Camillo, youll get well soon. Camillo, how are you? Camillo, answer! - Hes fine, don`tt worry. - He needs some fresh air. - Stop. - Whats up? - I am feeling fine. - What? I faked because I was bored of the ballet. He likes to fake. I couldnt stand it anymore. - I wanted to be alone with you. - He did it to be with you. - Go, Leone. - Ill go to see Fanny`ss ballet. Vittoria, come with me. I must show you something. Go back a little bit. Stay there. - Here? - Go back. Go to the coloumn. Thats it. Are you ready? Look. - Since when? - Ive been walking for a couple of days. I didnt tell anybody because. Let`ss take a seat. Somebody who doesnt know might come. I didnt tell anybody mainly because... I dont want that a friend of mine knows it. I met him at Lourdes, hes sick too. He doesnt walk at all. His sickness is definitive. He cant walk. So I am sorry to show him that I can walk. I wanted to be alone with you, because I have something to ask you. Do you have any blond woman friends, with blue eyes and nice hands? Not for me, for him. - Not for me. - I got it. I would like to help him because hes suffering. Hes an intelligent guy. Hes nice, intelligent. He has a soul. - He has a real soul. - We all have one. - Me too? - Sure. Hes completely different from me. - He can write poems. - Then hes a sensitive person. - Am I a sensitive person? - No, you are not. Exactly! Hes a sensitive person. He`ss different from me. He has something more, he has a very sensitive soul. He can write, do thing... Hes a nice guy! I feel like helping him. Do you know the sad thing about it? Do you know what hurts me most of all? Hes a lonely guy. He doesnt have a woman! He lives alone. How can he do that? How do you know that? I know because I went at his place and there was nobody. Hes alone! Hes really... For example. He has some towels at home. they are new towels. Think how weird is: those towels are embroidered. In a towel theres the writing "'he"' and in the other "she"'. Once I went into his bathroom. The towel with the writing "he" was worn out. It was not a towel, it was a rug. It made me sad to look at that towel. How can a towel look like a rug? The towel with the writing "she"' was immaculate! He was as clean as just out of the shop. One was clean, the other one was disgusting. So, while I was in the bathroom, I thought. Loneliness reveals itself in the most different ways. Even comparing two towels. So I want to help him. We must do this and pretend we dont know each other. We dont want to show that the meeting has been arranged. We must meet by chance and introduce him your friend. - Any available seats? - Yes, theres a table. - Lets be quick. - Wait a moment. - My mum said she would come by. - We lost the last table. Lets go inside in case. I am sorry, we dont have anymore seats. Can those two ladies sit at your table? - Sure. - Thanks. The one in the green dress is very pretty. - You like her, dont you? - I never said it! - You don`tt like her? - I don`tt know. - Its your type: blond, sensitive, intelligent. - How do you know? Shut up! Theyre arriving. Were sorry to bother you, but there were no more seats. Thats a pleasure, sit down. He got into the fire and.. - Ladies, theres one table available, do you want it? - No, thanks. He throw himself in the fire looking for that old man... ...but he couldnt find him. He couldnt find him because of the smoke. Then they saw him in the fire. The show was impressive and everyone was shouting. They said: " Why risk a young life for an old man? ' So, before going inside... ...he turned back and answered to them. He said: "'Because?,"' He said it before going in. He turned back and said: "'Because... "' - What did you say before going in? - I cant remember. He cant remember. What a man! This explains everything! Anyway, he got inside and saw the old man. Thats what he said! "'Because... ' "The... that... " "A mans life has no age"' This is what he said before going in, isnt that nice? - Thats very nice! - It`ss really nice, madam. - What were we saying? - He was taking out the old man. He was almost out of the house... ...and at that very moment... a huge beam fell on him, The beam hit him on the back, Its useless to say more. Everyone knows what happened. The place was full of people... ...but nobody did anything. Am I right? - They were careless. - I hate carelessness! I am a passionate woman! I need strong sensations! I am a crazy woman but I think that you are a bit crazy too. Sure! We also are... Hes the craziest of all. of all? All, I mean... He and me. All means more than two persons. - Just two is not enough? - No, it isnt. Anyway, hes the craziest of us both. The all of us. Hes the craziest. So, just being together with him... ...I went crazy too. He that dwells next door to a cripple will learn to halt! Thats a proverb. Nice meeting! He reminds me somebody I knew. We were at the station during the trains strike. The morning after Mussolini arrived. He sent back home the strikers. If he wouldnt have come, we would have waited forever. I can still remember his words. "'This sorts of things wont happen anymore"'. Infact since hes governing, the trains are on time. They didnt need to elect him Prime Minister, to have the trains on time. They could have elected him station agent. Vittoria and I are going away. You should know I am a Party member. If Mussolini will be in town Ill be clapping in first row. - Good morning. - Good morning. How come a nice lady like you is sitting in this ugly place? I am lawyer Ubaldo Piro, I have a professional interest. I am here to warn you about a possible agitator. He was against Mussolini, so... This is not a womans business. Tell me his name and Ill take care of this. I am not sure if I can do that. - His name is Camillo Pianese, - Pianese. - I thought that... Dont worry, miss. We kept our promise. I just wanted to tell ask you something. We met two girls, but we dont really know them well... ...how can you say that? Thats incredible! Dont worry, Orlando. When she left, she said goodbye to you. - She was angry with me, but I dont care. - That`ss not what I want to know. I noticed you like each other. When youll meet again, you can excuse about me. Tell her we are not friends, that you barely know me. Dont worry about me, just think about her. Can you get the acid for me? The acid again? I am not going to meet her again. Why are you worried about me, Orlando? You think that if I would meet her, I would be e excluded. Dont worry, try to be with her. Why should I sabotage such a nice and spontanous love? Spontaneus? I like the other woman. - Which one do you like? - The other one. - Vittoria? - Sure, they were two. Sei diventato pazzo! Ti piace Vittoria? - Cant I like her? - You can, but... What do you mean by saying you like her? Are you stupid? Did you get who is Vittoria? You dont know anything about women! You are joking. Dont be stupid! Anita is nice and intelligent. She is interesting too. Shes your type" blond, blue eyes, slender hands. Long and beautiful hands, just the way you like it. And you still think about Vittoria? Please, stop it. I have to go. I dont have an ideal woman. But I like Vittoria. Shes so sweet, so nice, so cute... I would like to hold her face in my hands. Cute? To hold her face? Dont get blinded by this sort of things. You don`tt know anything about women. Cute and sweet make no sense. Now you think shes cute... ...and I admit that she really is. But this kind of women "'curl up". What do you mean? It depends on their bones structure. They have small bones. With the time they get even smaller. You cant even hold their hands anymore. You make a big effort for nothing. Anita has a good physique, growing with the time. I like Vittoria, And the day I met her, I dreamt the Virgin Mary. - Its a sign. - Did you dream her too? - I did. Everybody dreams her, but me! What did she say? She asked me if I needed something. I was so moved that I couldnt ask bout anything. I said: "'I just want to be in your heart"' Now I know why she never appears to me. Shes smart! She appearss to those ones who forget about things and dont ask anything. If she would aks me, Id answer there`ss something I need. I want money and women, I want to heal and stay well, I couldnt stop about asking! But she appears to you. Infact she even appeared to my sister. She ask you what you need, and you cant answer. You are too much moved. Shes just Mother Virgin Mary! She wants to help you and you answer you want to stay in her hart. You stay in her heart and dont solve anything! Its the only thing I could say. I am leaving. - By, Camillo. - Leone! Stay with Orlando. - He did not understand. - I know. - I do support you. When i go to Rome, Ill tell it to Orlando. Good morning. My name is Camillo Pianese... My name is Camillo Pianese. - Well? - I just told you my name is Camillo Pianese. I dont live in Rome. I live in Acquasalubre, near the spas. The spas are uphill, we live downhill, my hobby is to invent things. I invented two things. This against hair fall, you should test it, its a great invention. This is agains pain. I have some evidences to show you. This friend of mine had a weak skin. He used my lotion and now you can see the difference. He should be here but... It doesnt matter. This lotion stops the hair fall. We all know the hair fall is a big problem. - Its not a problem for a real italian man. - What? People with no hair do suffer because baldness makes you feel old. A30 years old person looks 20 years older. Hairs show the age of a person. If you talk to bald people... ? and ask them how do they feel, theyll answer all the same way. Theyll answer they feel fine, People can live with no hair. Its better with no air and you feel... I dont believe this invention can be useful. - I dont believe me neither. - It`ss an useless invention. Life is full of sorrows, we dont need toys... ...,we need human being. Its not so easy to live nowadays. Humble work, patient strenghth, dangerous life. This is how a good italian person should live of. The road to salvation is full of pain and sacrifice. - Did you say "'pain'? - Exactly. - I dont think this is useful. - It is not. - Look! - Whats going on? - Is Camillo walking? - He walked out of the tramway. - Camillo, youve arrived! - Take this. - Is it for me? - No, its for Orlando. - Where is he? - He came here and then he left. - What did he say? - Nothing, tell me. - Nothing? - No. What about the lotion and the acid? I invented some medicines against baldness and pain..., ., and a bald person tells me that pain is the road to salvation! - Very bad then? - Right. Theres a surprise in the other room. I am happy to see you so well. The doctor was right. - How do I look like? - You look very?, Like a nun. I wouldnt think you`dd become so,. Nun! I couldnt think to transform like this. The Mother Superiors says that when your soul changes, your aspect changes too" Im just a novice, my way is still very long. Can the nuns hug men? - Camillo, were brothers! - I am not embarassed. Dont worry. - I am your sister! - I know, I am arranging my stuff. I can help you. You are tired. I met Orlando, hes a nice guy! - You met him today? - Yes. - You should have waited me. - He did, but then he had an apponintment. With who? I dont know, he just said he had to go. Did he look like somebody who should have come to Rome with me... ...and he didnt and wanted to say why? To me he looked normal. He seemed happy. He mentioned a girl. He said she has a different sort of intelligence. he said that When Jesus takes away something from you,he will give it back. I know. Whats the name of this thing That Jesus gave him back? - He said he met her with you in a cafe. insieme al bar. - With me? - Is he a blond girl? - No, shes French. - French? - Yes, French. - Is she Vittoria? - Yes, she is Vittoria. Is Camillo walking? This is a miracle! As I came back I saw you walking Noone had told me about that, Really? Now that you are feeling well, can I tell you something? Tell me anything, or better, everything. Instead of the lotion, you are using lemon juice. I switched it, you had too many sores. - Is this all? - It is. - Did you change my lotion? - Yes, because it was not good for you. How do you know I didnt want the sores? Your doctor told me. My doctor? Why dont you care about your sickness! I dont interfere! Why are you so mean? - I should be angry with you. - Really? I didnt come to Rome because I was angry. I see! Do you think I am so stupid? I felt... I felt cheated by your recovery. Now its over. I don`tt deserve your wickedness. Am I wicked? Do you think you are nice to me? Why is it all over? Why are you so nice? Are you asking for some kind of forgiveness? You are so nice because theres something you have to tell me... ...and so youre trying to gain my friendship. No, I am not. Dont keep on lying!? Fine! I dont want to know. And I even bought you the straw hat! I bought it because you were not with me. Ill give it to you! I don`tt want money Take it! - Heres Pianese. - That`ss him? - What do you want? Let me go! What did I do? Why are you beating me? Dont touch him! He can`tt walk! - Pianese? - How are you? - Fine. - Did they beat you? - Just on my hands. I wanted to tell you that... - Are you going out with Orlando? - Yes, hes a smart guy. Very smart... He says that you are smart, you say the same thing about him. Wow! How smart the two of you! How can you be so smart? - Nothing, we just talk, - I see... about what? - I dont know. - You will say something smart, I imagine... - You have never been smart to me. - Thats not true - Have you? - I dont know... - See? I bet you recite poetry. I could bet it. I sent some poems to a publisher but he didnt like them. - He didnt like them. - I knew! He didnt like them because they are ugly! Always about the sun, the sky, the sea... "I saw the sun... "' "I saw the sea... " These poems dont make sense! Do you want to write a poem? Dont write 100 poems with 2 lines, just write a long one. Write a poem with a story to excite the reader. A war, a fight, horses... Write something interesting! In Orlandos poems there are no horses. You know because you read them. Have you ever seen a horse there? In his poems everything is static. Put some movement, something human... Nothing. I think that his poems are... I will never tell him, but I dont like his poems. Theyre too short..., they don`tt say anything. Maybe you like them because you are smart guys. Get engaged, be smart together and God bless you! I translate his poems in french. In France we might be famous. In France is the just the same, do you think french people are stupid? Do you think they might like the sun and the sea of Orlando? If something is ugly, its ugly everywhere. Ill go back to Paris. I`lll leave very soon. Are you leaving? - With Orlando? - No, with dad. Orlando will join me with the poems. - Do you still love me? - Do you? - I asked you if you still love me. - Time is over, miss. Dont put the hat on the bed. - Why not? - Its bad luck. A friend of mine told me that. - Its a nice hat. - Do you like it? - Its yours. - No. - Please. It didnt bring me a good luck, maybe it will to you. Its difficult to get an immigration permit. I wasnt surprised when I didn`tt get it. I am sorry you cant join us in Paris. Your poems are so nice! I brought you this manuscript. Its a novel. If you read it when we will be far away youll find yourself in it. Thanks, Ill put it into my feeling`ss bag. Thanks again, Orlando. Thats nothing compared to what you gave me during these weeks. I never had a woman to talk to... ...and now that I found her, she is leaving. I wouldnt leave, but French people don`tt have easy time in Italy. It would be impossible to live here. I am sorry for Fanny. She was born in Italy. Give me a souvenir..., .,so that I can think of you forever. I am in love with you. Tell me that you love me a little bit. - I dont... - It doesn`tt matter, tell me. Stop it, Orlando, I cant do it. I can just be your friend. Ive something else important to tell you. Something about you, me and Camillo. Thats so funny! We met before Camillo would introduce us. - We didnt. - We did. One day you went out of the shop shouting and I was there. I tried to take a look at you, but I had a towel on my face. If I would have seen you, everything would be different now. Camillos 'game'... ...my love for you, he going to jail. All this because of a towel on my face. The first time he told me about you, he mentioned some towels. - The ones with the writing `hhe``` and ```hher```.. - I never had them before. Camillo is a liar. He always told me you didnt love him anymore. And instead... In that case I was a liar... I wanted him to believe it, amd me too. I almost did it. "'Camillo is sick again. "' "'He has been in jail for 2 years and he has no more hope left"' "'Were his legs healed because his heart was hoping again?"' "'Or was he walking again thanks to a miracle?" "His friends thinks hes in a convent, not in jail. "' "'I lost any confidence for an answer from him"'. How are you? I am feeling bad. Are you here to set me free? Yes, I have an important role in the Party. Leone told me that. I thought... - I thought you forgot me. - How could I? I didnt want to create suspects you are in jail! Now I am a politician, i work in the culture department and I write DAscanio`ss speeches. - When am I going out? - In a fortnight. When youll be out we go to D'Ascanio. Ill tell him you are a friend and you are an hero. Ill tell him you saved an old man, can you remember? I can stand it anymore. I cant stand the stories about the old man and the hero... Thats good you tell these things. I want to go back home and live in peace... ...with people like me. I want to live in peace. Listen, Camillo, many things have changed. It will be difficult to start again, but I can help you. We must be quick, I am going to Ethiopia. But before I leave, I must do something for you. I want for you a a good life in your village. I want you to have everything you need, ok? Please, smile! Vittoria? Vittoria? I dont know, Ive not seen her anymore. Maybe she`ss married. - Who told you? - I said 'maybe', - This is the program... - Were you engaged? - No, we werent. - Did you go to France with her? - No, I didnt. - Have you ever been together? - No, never. - So, youve never seen her anymore. - No, I haven`tt. I thought.., I thought that... I should go now, dont put that face and smile! Youll be out in a fortnight. Next time I dont want to see you on a wheelchair. Camillo, stay in your village, so that I know where to find you. Bye, Camillo, Wait a moment. They must help me with the bags. Leone? Leone? How are you, Camillo? Give me the bag. Welcome back. What have you done? - Lets go. - Where? - I prefer to go at dad`ss place. Wait! Dad moved to our place! Give me the bags, I can carry them. - Theyre so heavy! - I`lll carry them. There`rre books. We have to talk about everyhing. Many things have changed, These people will sleep here tonigh. They said they saw the Virgin in the windows. Camillo has not been out for a month. - Take him with you. - He wont come. - He will. If he goes out people will see him, they just want to talk to him and stroke him, He just has to go out and say there was no miracle. So people calm down and leave him in peace, They cant stay there outside forever. - Go and by some milk. - Dont bother. These things annoy him. Hes so lucky, though. Because he has a brother like me who doesnt make him feel guilty. Ill go and buy milk. If you need something, I can go. If anybody wants to knowm just ask me. Everybody ask me if Camillo got a miracle. I was very annoyed by this story. I wont bother you. I am going to buy milk. Otherwise, what am I here for? - Camillo, can you bring the scissors? What is this? It says: 'Ill love you forever', - Whos that? - It`ss Vittoria! - Who? - This letter was inside Leones drawer. - I have no idea. Dont you know anything about this? This is my mail! "'This is my new adress". Where is the adress? Heres the adress! She`ss pointing at it. Dont touch my stuff! Leone took the letter. - Did he? - Yes and he didnt give it to you. - Where is it? - What? - Its a postcard from Vittoria. - Why didn`tt you give it to me? - Why? - I forgot it. - It was in your drawer! - Why you didnt give it to me? - I forgot it. You forgot it? - Why? - Aaah! What have you done? Did you hurt yourself? Let me see. Traitors! Youre all traitors. Leone hid the letter from me. I am not a traitor! Shut up! You are a viper! Traitors! Hell be back. When Orlando will be back from Etiopia I will ask him if he met her. I want to now if he went to France and see what hes going to answer. Do you know what Etiopia means? Etiopia means Paris! Did you get it? They live together in Parigi. In Parigi! When he came to the jail Orlando told me to stay here, so he knew where to find me. But he said it to stop me. Sure! Finally you realized it! Dont listen at him, Leone doen`tt know what he`ss talking about. Why Vittoria is wearing Orlandos straw hat? Youre obsessed by that straw hat. Therere billions of straw hats in Paris! I know that straw hat! I bought it in Rome, and has a brown ribbon. Is there only one straw hat with a brown ribbon? She and the straw hat! The straw hat and she! - You are all traitors. - Are you starting again? Traitor and straw hat, straw hat and traitor. My God! - You are all traitors. - Go on. - Are you feeling bad? - No, I am fine. You are sorry for the way you treated me before. You realized that your brother... - What is in your hand? - Nothing. - Is it a little soldier? - No, it isnt. - Its a soldier. - It isn`tt. - What is it? - Nothing. - My passport. ? What for? - Nothing. Well? I came to ask you a favour. Can I borrow your passport? I have to go to France, I have a photo, but I dont have the passport. No. No, I cant give it to you. Leone, please. I need it. Only you can help me. You have always helped me. Leone, please. I have to go away. I cant live here anymore, I feel empty. Same old story, the gentleman feels empty..., ., he asks me for a favour and I fill up his emptiness. But who is going to fill up mine? All my life like this. At the seminary I was an empty priest. I had to get married but now I am an empty husband. As a fascist, I never felt full... I can just take care of you. On the contrary, you come, take my passport, and travel around the world, And what about me? Leone, are you stupid? - Should I be always sick to make you happy? - Yes! If you would have loved me like I did... I am not going to give you my passport. Thats too easy. You are not going, you are staying! Fuck, you, the soldiers and the passport! Take everything. I dont want anything from you! Go to Liberato. Hes my friend and he can help you. - Pap?, can you tell to Leone that... - Dont worry. - I love him, but I have to go. - Hell understand. - Take some money. - Dont worry. - Take it. Go!
