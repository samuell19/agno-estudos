What do you want? - Well, let's just say it's pink. - Oh, God. Forget it, pal. No way. I might forget it. I'm a nice guy. But them? They think the title to your car might be worth something. I'm tweaking, dude. All right, buddy. Say you lose this race and you decide to keep going... But when we get done with her, I don't think you'll want her back again. You know what I mean? Take care of her, fellas. Okay. The first one to Dragonfire Crossing wins. You lose the race, you lose your car. Ready, set, go! Hey, guys, she's all ours. Nice and legal. It's all right. It's all right. You okay? All right. I would've won. You had to cheat to beat me. Forced me off the road. That ain't racing. That's trying to murder someone. You lost, guy, what can I say? Now, take your girl and walk. I think you'll find it safer that way. You're nothing but road pirates. You gotta cheat to win. Let's go, George. Escape, pal, while you've still got your lips attached to your face. - Yeah, George. - Yeah, George. - Bye, George. - George. - Bye, George. - Bye, Georgie. All right, let's hook up the Daytona and get the hell out of here. Hey, is this the way to Crawford Dam? It's a little ways up, and then you take the Willow River cutoff. - Thanks. - Hey, wait. Are you new in town? Yeah, I... Hey, I'll show you the way. - Hop on. - Okay. - I'm Jake Kesey. - I'm Keri Johnson. - 0h, great. - What? - I can't ride. - Boyfriend? No way. Keri, get in. I don't know. I was just walking out of my house, turned my back, and the next second he was there. Like magic, almost. - Really? - Yeah, really. He seemed familiar to me. What did he want? Nothing. He's new in town. You know, you can get killed riding on the back of bikes, Keri. Excuse me? You're mine, and I'll do anything necessary to keep it that way. You think you own me, - that somehow I'm your property. - You are. Nobody loves you as much as I do. Nobody. It's because everybody's scared of you. If you're not going to be my girl, you're not going to be anybody's. - Minty, give me a light. - Here you go. Hey, bro. Man, it's a hot one today, huh? Look, do you mind ifl lay my towel here? I ain't welcome over there. Why not? Why ain't I welcome or it's okay to lay here? Take your pick. Hey, you new in town or something? - Got a name? - Jake. Jake. I'm Billy Hankins. lwork over at Big Kay's, slinging burgers. Listen, you ever need a burger in Brooks, you call me, okay? Man, she's beautiful, don't you think? Me and her are pretty good friends. Well, actually, she's... She used to be tight with my brother. She's got real problems with that lunatic she's with there now. What kind of problems? Well, Packard's a mistake of nature, a genetic misfire. Packard gets crazy jealous if anybody even looks at Keri cross-eyed. You gotta wear dark glasses so he doesn't catch you at it. That includes your brother, I assume, right? - My brother Jamie? - The guy you were just talking about. He was murdered up on the Willow River, but nobody ever knew who did it. - I'm sorry, man. I had no idea. - It's okay, bro. Look at all these girls, Skank. Laying around the rocks, they hardly got any clothes on. Jesus, Gutterboy! This shit's got some kick. A lot of duckbutter out at the lake today, hey, Pack? Quiff City, here I come. See that guy over there? - The one with Billy Hankins. - What about him? Looks like a dork to me. There's a lot of dorks going around these days, Skank. Whole town's seething with them. They're just crawling out the woodwork... - Shut up. - Okay. He drives that motorbike over there. If you see him or Billy around Keri, I wanna know about it. Shit, Pack. I'd rather be working on the cars and... We do things my way, Skank. It's a lot of fun. I know that's easy for you to forget with your brain turning to mush and all. Actually, my brain's functioning a-okay, dude. It's just my, you know... So let's just do things my way, huh? Before I have to cut another ring hole in this flap you call your ear. Okay. Hey, we'll remind the cock-stacker. - Use our influence, hey, Gutt? - We'll use our influence. - Remember, the kid on the bike. - You got it, Pack. There. It's all programmed in, man. Good. And, Skank, do me a favor, will you? Get rid of that piss you're drinking before it turns you into a mushroom. No problem. Yeah, right. Damn! Mushroom. It's a nice day, huh? This water's a bit chilly for my taste. Good thing it's warm out. - Sorry about the ride this morning. - It's okay. - Billy Hankins a friend of yours? - Yeah, sort of. Keri! - I'd better go now. - Don't go because of me. Not because of you. It's because of him. You don't know him. Keri! You know, if you want to come by some night... - Yeah? - I mean, after work, I'll be there. - Well, so will I, then. - Okay. - The thing is, where's work? - Big Kay's Burgers. - Big Kay's Burgers. - Yeah. - All right. - Okay. I'd like a regular burger, well-done, and a cheeseburger, and... And a large fries. Okay, who had ordered the fries? Okay, four cheeseburgers. Let's 90. Order up. Order up. I got a cowboy out there, wants two burgers, rare, and I mean rare! Honey, I'll have it so rare that a good veterinarian will have it back on its feet in 10 minutes! - You coming? - Sure. Good. This thing runs best when I have a good navigator. - If I can get the beast to start. - Come on, you goof. Hey, it's the fumes off the grill, Keri. It melts my mind. - Oh, come on. - Oh, God, it's him. - Hurry up. - I'm trying. I'm trying- Hurry up. Oh, man! Hello, Keri. Looks like I got here just in time. You, in the car. I mean now. Hey, listen, Pack, I was just on my way out, too... Hold your horses, guy. - Packard, please. - Just get in the car for a minute. I just want to speak to Billy alone. Help her out. So, what happened here? Looks to me like you ran out of those all-beef patties kind of early today? Hey, don't worry, Pack. We still got plenty of dog food. Hey, Packard, let's grind up some meat, huh? Hey, has this guy been wormed or is he just a naturally gifted child? I swear to God, I'll rip your head off and piss down your throat. Hold your water, Oggie. This is business. Nothing personal, guy. That's a nice car you have here. Now, where were you going with my girl? Come on, Pack. I was just giving her a ride home, man. Give me a break. Hey, Rughead, what's this Triumph worth? You're not getting it, Packard. You're not taking it. - Who said anything about taking it? - I didn't say nothing. - Did you say anything? - Not me, Pack. I know I didn't. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna give you the same chance I give everybody else. We're gonna race for it. Look, Pack, you don't get my car. And if you're not nice, you're not gonna get your burgers with the mayo and thousand island, - the way you love them. - Billy. Billy, I thought you understood me. This isn't a negotiation. Rugs. - You ever seen one of those before? - Let's just add it to our collection. We can figure out what it is second. All right, Billy, we'll continue this discussion later, and I'll enjoy it. I'll see you later, huh, faggot? Hey, Packard, I think he's going to the sandy bar. - Let me take him this time. - It's your turn, dude. Let's go! All right! All right. I want you to tear this guy a new asshole. Do it to him Oggie-style. I'll burn this Iranian. Okay, the first to Rattler's Crossing wins. You lose the race, you lose your car. Agreed? Stay on your side of the road, man. Okay, let's get it on. - Send them off. - Say what? I said, "Send them off." We'll take the Willow River cutoff. Ready, set, Roger that, Murphy. A paramedic has been notified, They are on their way. - You think he made it? - You gotta be kidding me. - Local kid? - Used to be. Call the meat wagon. Then get a hold of Loomis, tell him we got a possible DOA up here. Loomis, we got a snuffed kid up here in Mule Tail Coulee. It's Oggie Fisher. Roger that. This is Stokes, Murphy. We just saw a paramedic down at the cutoff... I've been waiting to catch you guys in the act. Been waiting and watching. Congratulations. You caught us talking. There's no law against that, is there, Officer? Unless, of course, I got my wires crossed, and you caught us speaking without a permit. Clam it, wise guy. There's a dead kid three miles up the highway. Yeah, that's right. Dead. Run off the highway and killed. Okay, pal. Time to drain the drug overdose sloshing above your eyebrows and tell me who the dude was driving that other car. With all due respect, sir, if you're putting us under arrest, I do believe we have right to counsel. What about you, maggot? You got anything to say or are your veins bloated with brain eradicator, too? - Yeah. Well, who got killed? - Oggie Fisher. There isn't enough left of him to stick in a cigar box. Hey, Loomis, I think you ought to see this. - Murphy, what for? - I think you should see this. - That's ugly, God. - Kid ought to be dog meat. Wait a minute. Yeah, Loomis, this kid smashed down a canyon through fire and busting glass. Must've been 1,000 degrees in that car. - At least. - Where's his eyes? Sent cats climbing up my spine when I saw them hauling this corpse out of that canyon. Clean, as if he'd come out of a hot tub. I'm worried, Loomis. Something ain't right. Well, get him into town and box him up. I've still got a few rocks to turn over up here. All right, load him up. You don't even want to know what I just saw, asswipe. Now, spill it. Who was driving that other car? Nobody ever saw it before. It wasn't a local car. It was... It was customized or something. Yeah, it was like a VW conversion with bodacious bags, you know, and a surf rack on top. It was awesome, man. Well, no one seems to be too broken up about Mr. Fisher laying there, splayed out to four points of the compass. But then again, maybe that's what things have come down to, huh? Now, Deputy Halifax over there is going to take down a list of names for me. So if any of you guys are planning on taking a vacation in the next few days, you can just forget it. I'll be visiting you again with warrants, Mr. Attorney. Okay, Halifax, they're all yours. Oggie Fisher. They got us all. Let's cruise. Yo, Gutterboy. - What, Skank? - Let's jam. Yo, Rugs, that kid in the Daytona gave me a hell of a run last night. lfl hadn't tried to kill him, he might've beat me. When's the new injection plan going to be ready? Tonight, maybe. Maybe tomorrow. The digital radio killers, they're almost ready, too. Good. The sooner the better. Things are getting a little too equal these days. Sure, Packard. Hey. Hey, what seems to be the problem? I just can't believe that Oggie's dead. I mean, he lived just up the street from me. - | just can't believe it. - Oggie's no loss, believe me. Now tell me something. What were you doing with Billy Hankins today? - I was tired. I decided to go home. - Don't lie to me. - I love you too much for you to lie. - I'm not lying, Packard. You and me, we're like... We're like blood brothers. I guess you could call us blood lovers, 'cause that's how much I love you. And when you love someone as much as I love you, after a while you feel nothing. And when you feel nothing, you can do anything. I don't love you. I've never made love to you. I never will. You will. Hey, Rug, how are we doing on the digital radio killer? - It's tips. It's totally functional. - Yeah? What about the injection plan? - It's ready. - It's ready? Sure. I told you, man, it'll blow away anything this side of the Mississippi. Good. Now all we have to do is fit it in the 'Vette. I can fit this thing in a go-kart. What are you worried about? When is this thing gonna be chopped? - Tomorrow morning. - Tonight. - You got that, Gutterboy? - Yeah, okay. - What about those... - Yeah, Packard, I got those elbow parts, sold them to those Dallas boys for 2,900 bucks. Yeah, that old guy was pretty pissed off. Look, guy. Loomis is out there looking to bust everyone. Losing Oggie ain't no big deal, and that's a hell of a car you got there. Buddy, I'd put that kidney-buster down if I was you. This place is filled with ether and acetylene. Dig? - No! - Hey! I don't know what your problem is, guy, but... Hey! I'm out of here! What's your problem, man? Holy shit! Where'd he go? Skank, you pussy. - Skank! - Yeah? Who was that guy? I don't know. But whoever he was, he's weird and pissed off. - Oh, man! - Man! - Redd. - Yeah? Loomis here. Hey, Loomis. A real strange place you got here. Really unique in its depressing qualities. What do you need? Bingo. You got a couple of cockroaches working here. I need a word with them. My nephew, Skank and his pal, Gutterboy? Over there. Clear for takeoff. - Morning, fellas. - Yo, Skank. - It's a nice place you got here. - Skank, a little help here. - Been working here long? - Man, I smell a cop. - You smell a cop? - I smell french fries, Skank. But that don't make no sense, huh? Bud, you got a warrant? I don't need a warrant when I have this badge. We know our constipational rights, sir. You can'tjust come in here... Wow. I got this problem, fellas. Oggie Fisher, your buddy who got greased, I wanna know who was driving the car that ran him into kingdom come. Nobody's seen that guy before... He hit me in the head again. Skank, okay. I can't remember dog-squeeze when it comes to getting run off of roads, there, Loomis. I can see why, Skank. I can call you Skank, can't I? Yeah. Unless you like Maurice better. Now you listen good, Skank. I know it's gonna be hard with your melon on chemical overload, but there's a killer out there and I'm gonna track the hairball down. So when you two crater-heads get finished mining for nose-gold and you get a relapse of memory, you let me know, huh? I'm just a phone call away. We ain't got no telephone, Skank. - How about a little hydro pump? - No. - Here you go. - Well, thank you. It looks good. - No charge for the sarge. - I'm a lieutenant, you know. What is this? All units, this is Loomis. I'm at Big Kay's. I want everyone to stand by. Over. I got an order up for Mr. Bucky. Here you go, out of here. So where is he, tuna-can? Dude, we couldn't find the slime-ball anywhere. Yeah, we went across town, down to Crawford Gully, - and we stopped for a box of Goobers... - You guys are pissing me off. I want that faggot. Yeah, this freak's into us for about 13,000 bucks. We spent all last night banging on them two bodies. I got scabs on my knuckles and everything like that. It's your damn job, Gutterboy. - What has he got with us? - He's got an ass-full of trouble. Yeah, it's about time we get into somebody's ass, huh? Yeah, we're gonna beat him like a red-headed stepchild. I'm gonna knock his ass lower than whale shit! - Where does he go? - I don't know. But I'm gonna find that son of a bitch. Keri, I'll pick you up later tonight, so do yourself a favor and be here. He's on Lookout Mountain Road. Let's go. All right. We got action heading out. I'll keep radio contact. Stokes, you in position? Over, Affirmative, sir. Over. - Murphy, are you out there already? - Affirmative, sir. There he is! I'd say it's about time we give that yellow-ass bastard a taste of his own medicine. Yeah. Skank, why is it you continue to question my authority? 'Cause, man, you got a big audience with Rughead over there, man. - It'd be first-degree murder. - You're right. Hey, hey, it's my turn. I'll teach that bastard a lesson for what he done to Oggie and our cars. Hey, you gotta raise your hood. We got a digital radio killer now. You try to run, we zap your electrical system! Oh, my God. What's wrong? Put it on. - Packard, get a load of this. - Connect the son of a bitch and go. Okay. First one to Dragonfire Crossing wins! You lose, you lose your car, you got that? This one's for Oggie, sucker! Ready, set... - Rughead, get them off. - Oh, shit. Go! Loomis, we're still in pursuit of that black car heading northbound on Dragonfire Crossing. Have you got that roadblock setup? We 're coming in at you at about 100 miles an hour. Roger that, Murphy, Halifax has three units just over the bridge. Let's run him right into it. Stand by. Watch your speed, watch your speed, Slow it down, Murphy. - Let it go, - Roger. I got you. All right, we got him now. We got the back door. Over. We have him trapped, men. Give him a few seconds and he'll realize it, too. He's going! He's going! Let's go! All units, this is Loomis. Head him off at Desert Highway intersect. Roger, Loomis. We copy. You see that? War of the Worlds. The invasion of Earth has begun right here in Arizona, folks. You got some imagination. Hey, I told you working at Big Kay's stimulates the brain. - Need a ride? - Nah. Good. I'd like to live to see my next birthday anyway. I'll see you. - God! You scared me. This thing's quiet. - Hop on. Lucky I came when I did. Yeah, I noticed you got a knack for doing that. There goes the dork. There's the dork with Keri. - Let's do him. - Think we can? He ain't no match for the Gutterboy. Skank, you're going a little fast. We can't fit through that, Skank! We're gonna... The garbage... - Got him now! - We got... Skank! - He's heading towards the park, Skank. - Yeah? What do you say we run this little bastard down and make his teeth bleed, huh? - What about the girl? You can't... - Just grab the shotgun, Mamaluca. The shotgun? I don't know nothing about no shotgun. - Just grab the goddamn gun, man. -I hate guns! Skank! - I'm a dick with a shotgun. - Grab it. Load it, man. Load it. What are you doing? Where's the bullets? - Where's the bullets? - I got the bullets. - Well, load it, man. Come on, hurry. - I'm trying. Shoot his tires out, you fool! Pull the trigger! With your finger, God damn it! Pull it! Nice shot. You blew the goddamn steering out. Thanks, Gutterboy. Kiss your ass goodbye. Oh, shit. I tried to warn you, Skank. I said, "Do we have to drive so fast and use a gun?" - I can't shoot no gun! - Shut up, Gutterboy. I gotta think, man. That is right, Skank-o. That's what you do best. Packard told us to keep an eye on his girl. Jesus, this shit's got some kick. We almost killed his girl. We're dead meat, now, Skank. You listen to me. Now, she's never going to fink, man. The bitch was with that dork, and she's as scared of Packard as anybody, you hear me? Now, we done what we was told. Too bad about the 'Cuda, Skank. It was a tits car. Jesus, this shit's got some kick. - It's been a while. - Nice. I thought so, too. Look, Jake, if Packard knew I was here with you... I mean, people are afraid of him for a reason. People are afraid because guys like Packard prey on fear and weakness. Well, ljust think he's crazy. Try and be brave against Packard and he might kill you. Or he might let you go. Courage isn't easy to come by. It's how he keeps those goons with him all the time. They're just scared. So am I. Keri, listen, there's gonna come a time when you'll have to take a stand. When you do that, that's when you free yourself up. No sooner. I want to believe you. I really do. Good night. Hey, Keri, there's a place on the Willow River. I thought if you want to go up there with me tomorrow... You like living dangerously, don't you? - You want to go? - Yes, I do. - Good night. - Good night. No way. Hey, asshole, come here. Come here. Skank, you look like shit. Why are you walking? Had a little problem with the 'Cuda, Packard. Kid on a bike just came by here. You see him? No, we ain't seen nothing all night... A motorbike with Keri on it or nothing, Pack. You're pissing me off. Get in. Holy shit! It's that kid. What the hell is going on here, Pack? You okay? - Kill him. - What? - Where the hell is he? - Right there. Eat hot lead, crud sucker! What the hell is that thing, man? He did something to the damn gun! He ain't no human, Pack. Bullshit! He's a kid. Just a kid. Hey, chicken-shit! Come on out of there. - Let's get the hell out of here. - I heard that. Loomis, what the hell are you doing here? You got a minute? You gotta be out of your mind, barging in here like this. - I got this problem, downtown. - I'm not going anywhere, guy. This is a warrant I got here, cockroach. Now move. - On your feet, buddy. Now! - That sounds important. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. See you in the squad car. This water's nice once you get used to it. It's nice just being here with you. - Wanna know something? - What? I couldn't sleep at all last night. I had strange dreams. I dreamed that the man in the moon was laughing at me. He tends to laugh all the time. Did you ever notice that? Then I was headed east on the back of a motorcycle, and the driver was Jamie Hankins. What's strange is that Jamie's dead. Yeah, I know, Billy told me. You know, Jamie was a lot like you. That could account for the dream, I guess. I like you. Oh, no! I love you. Sheriff's office. - It's Murphy. He's at home. - Tell him I'll call him back. He'll call you right back. Ain't you got any air in this joint? And your friend, Minty. Well, he was maggot pie before the car exploded. Excuse me. Is it true that his eyeballs was all sucked out of his sockets? Yeah. He's just like Oggie. Not a mark on him. We pulled the poor bastard from the fire cold in his own sauce. Almost gives me the willies just talking about it. Before I nail you bastards to the wall, I'll give you a chance to cooperate. - We'll do anything. - Hey, shut up. Loomis, we ain't done nothing illegal except maybe bust the speed limit. So why don't you give us all a break and let us get the hell out of here? You listen to me, you son of a bitch. There's a kid out there using his car to kill people. Not that it's such a big deal since it seems to be your gang he's got it in for. So, if you guys try to take the law into your own hands and that killer turns up dead, I'm gonna see you all sniffing cyanide in the Arizona gas chamber. Do you read? Here we are. - I'll stop by and pick you up later. - Okay. You know, today was the nicest day I've had in a long time. I thought so, too. - I'll see you. - Bye. Hey, genius. Take care. Maurice! - So where are you going? - Take care of some business. That woman sure ain't made our lives easy. You know what I mean, Gutterboy? What are you guys doing? We're gonna go screw around. Why, you want to come? - No. - You going on a vacation or something? I'm taking my blueprints and I'm leaving. This gang thing was okay when we had the edge. But now that there's that wraith out there that killed Oggie... - A what out there, man? - A wraith, man. A ghost! An evil spirit and it ain't cool. I don't know, except I'm quitting, and if I was you guys, I'd quit, too. I ain't got no beef against no wraith. Yeah, it's just a damn kid, man! Packard said so. - I'm leaving! - Too bad! Slosh this pig a 15, bud. Let's go cruise. Scare up some cooze at some place. You got it, Skank-o, because I'm a four-day virgin. Rughead must have forgot something. Kind of a mess now, don't you think? The Gutterboy and Skank, they were... They were right there. It's like they vaporized! They were adiosed by the kid in the Turbo. I warned them! I warned them! What are you trying to say, boy? That Skank and Gutterboy were in there when the place blew! I don't see it as impossible. I didn't know they had a kid in the car. I didn't know it was Jamie Hankins till he came up missing. So you're telling me that Packard and the others killed Jamie Hankins? Jamie Hankins was here the other night with a shotgun! A dead kid with a shotgun? - I've seen his eyes, Loomis. - Give me a break! I seen his eyes, and I got a real bad feeling. Bad feelings don't add up to resurrections, buddy. If it was Jamie Hankins, then why did they kill him off in the first place? I don't know. I've been too scared to say nothing. Packard hated Jamie. Packard hates everybody. He hates me! I don't wanna get killed over something I had nothing to do with. Oh, no! You go on home now, and you stay there till you hear from me, huh? Hey, Billy. Okay, I want two dogs, I want the onion rings... And, yeah, two orders of onion rings and two hamburgers, no cheese... How you doing, kid? I'm Officer Loomis. - Can I have a word with you? - What do you need? I'm swamped. Need some information about your brother. That's easy, he's dead. - Order up! - Yeah, I know. But his body never turned up, and now I've got four dead kids in one week. Four? I thought it was two. Skank and Gutterboy got lunched out at the warehouse. I figure Packard Walsh is next. Yeah, well, if he is, I'll shake the hand of the guy who does it. Order up! That might be impossible. Did your brother have a girl? Well, the night he was killed he was with Keri Johnson. Everybody knows that. Somebody busted in and smashed her head. She woke up the next day on a deserted highway somewhere, - wrapped in a Navajo blanket. - She have any idea who did it? Drifters, maybe. Maybe smugglers. Maybe Packard Walsh. Who knows. She never knew who did it or she would have said so. Keri Johnson, huh? - Thanks. - Order up. - Hey, Officer? - Yeah. What does my brother have to do with four dead guys? - I mean, what's the connection? - That's what I'm gonna find out. Keri. Now just is not the time to confront Packard. Well, if you don't say something soon, you're gonna be his prisoner for a long time. Who are you? - Ask Packard. - Packard? He knows why I'm here. See, I've come a long ways for you. My time is just about over. Got an order up for Gabriel. There you go. Fries. - Here you go. Anything else? - Yeah, could I have a... I can't talk now, Packard, I'm busy. Yeah? I've been checking you out past couple of days. You've been real busy. - Would you get out of here? - No. What are you doing? Packard, stop it! What are you doing? Stop it! Get in the car. Packard, what the hell are you doing, man? - Are you crazy? - Butt out of my face, burger boy, or you'll wind up dead like your brother. Billy. You bastard chicken-shits! You let him take her! So where are we going? Somewhere no one will ever find us. - Where's that, Packard? - West. California. Santa Barbara, someplace like that. I'm not going. Yes, you are, Keri. Remember that night when you guys found me with Jamie Hankins? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, think. When you broke in and we had just finished doing it. - So it was you. - Yeah. I was always with Jamie. I never made any promises to you. You're mine, that's it. You think I'd go to California with you? I'd rather go to Nogales and have the Gutterboy's cretin children and die than to be with you. You better shut up now, Keri, or I'm gonna have to... Yeah, you can kill me, too, Packard. But you can never make me love you. Packard, you're pathetic. You want a race? Because I'll show you a race! We got him, Loomis. We're in pursuit. Over. All units, we're on Diamondback. Unit 64, 10-4, request all additional units We have a suspect heading westbound on Ridge Road. Over. Dispatch, we 're in high speed pursuit of silver Corvette, red trim, and that black Turbo. Roger, Unit 64, Give us your location again, go ahead. Come in, Loomis, We 're heading north on Diamondback highway. Over. Roger that. 16 headed north on Diamondback. Oh, shit! My God! Just like all the others. Loomis, there's only one body here. Cover him up. You want us to set up a new roadblock? We can still catch the bugger. - Got guys waiting. - Forget it, Murphy. Roadblocks won't stop something that can't be stopped. Loomis, what are you saying? I'm saying it's over. There's nobody left in Packard's gang to kill. Clean this mess up and get the hell out of here. I can't do that again. You know who I am. Jamie. It's as close as I could come to who I once was. It's close enough. Just think of this as a second chance. We were meant to be together, Keri. - Look, I got one more thing to do. - Don't leave me again. Don't worry, I'll be back. It's a short trip, pack light. - Come on, Packard! - Relax. You scared me, man! I'm sorry, man. - It's been a heavy day already. - I can see that. Well, it's time for me to hit the road. My business here is finished. Before I do, I want you to have something. - She's yours now. - Who's mine? It's outside. Turbo Interceptor. The only one in existence. It does very special things. Take care of it, will you? Who are you, bro? You said it, Billy. - I got to go. - Hey, man, wait a minute. Where you going? Where you going? Hey, Billy, the instructions are in the glove compartment. Wait a minute! Come back! Come back, bro! Hey, man, far out! Hey, Jake, who are you? Couldn't have been. Jake! Jake! Jamie!
