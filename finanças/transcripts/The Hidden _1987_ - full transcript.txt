Oh. Argh! Argh! Argh! Arrgh! Drop it! Argh! - Argh! - Don't shoot, please! Freeze! Arrrrgh! Argh! Quick, run! Get out of here! Hurry! Get down behind something. Somebody get the police! Get down! Go! He went that way in a black Ferrari, go! Suspect is... Look out! Oh! Now in pursuit, Wilshire and Parkview. Suspect is currently... Stop! Oh, my god! Ugh! Yeah, that's him, all right. That's Jack. Real nice man, kinda quiet. Real gentleman. When was the last time you saw him? Oh, I haven't seen him in... About a week. What did he do, Rob a bank? Hey, Tom, we gotta move. They've got DeVries. High-speed pursuit, west Hollywood. Thanks for your help. Aaaah! Gah! Right. Phillips. Let's go. Continuing high-speed pursuit. Please advise. Yes, sir. All right, Johnson, vac, you're with me. 6-W-20 to control... Watch your ass, guys. Right. Hey, Beck. How many units you got in pursuit, Sandy? Two. How long? Well, I wouldn't go for coffee. 6-W-20. That's your lot. There he is. Give me that. Tommy, come on! Come on! Get out of the way! Heh! Mr. DeVries' condition is deteriorating. We'll have to move him back to intensive care. You think he'll make it, doc? Well, with all the trauma, it's a miracle he's still alive. I doubt he'll last the night. Good. Keep us up to date, will you, doc? Dr. cutler... Detective Beck. No one deserves to die like that. I don't care what the man's done. He killed 12 people, wounded 23 more... Stole 6 cars, most of 'em Ferraris... Robbed 8 banks, 6 supermarkets... 4 jewelry stores and a candy shop. 6 of the ones he killed, he carved up with a butcher knife. 2 of them were kids. He did all that in 2 weeks. If anybody deserves to go that way... It sure in the hell was him. Man, in background: 1-L-19 requesting a sergeant... look, ed, Tom Beck is the best I've got. If I give him to you now, I'll never get him back again. My department will then crumble... oh, yeah... crime will run rampant... The city will fall into ruin... I said it's gonna be OK. Rampaging hordes will control the streets... And life as we know it will end. Hey, hey, hey, John. I don't want Willis, I want Beck. Senator's coming here to announce... He's running for president, for Christ's sake. I mean, you've gotten some threats. You don't want some dead-ass blowing him away... In our division, do you? Ed, Willis is a better man now. He's been with Beck for over a year. Give him another shot. Send Beck to my office, John. Bye. Hi. Lieutenant Masterson. Yeah, I'm Masterson. Who are you? Lloyd Gallagher, FBI. What can I do for you? I'm following a suspect. I need some local law enforcement help. I spoke with your captain. He assigned me a detective Thomas Beck. Sure you got it down? Yeah, I know. That's the best I can do, ma'am. I'll get him to call back... all right. Huh huh. Confiscated 3 pounds of marijuana... Beck. This is agent Lloyd Gallagher, FBI, Seattle. You'll be working with him the next few days. I'm in the middle of a case here, I haven't finished my shooting report. What am I supposed to do, drop this? Doesn't anybody say please anymore? Please. Oh. How can I refuse? You can't. Bureau's getting them younger every day now. Yeah. Must get 'em right out of high school. No, no, no. Don't put it on my desk. Come on, man. Beck! Do not put that on my desk. Do not put that on my desk. Beck, come on, give me a break, I haven't seen my wife in a month. Believe me, she's fine. I was with her last night and she said to say hello. Sends you a big kiss. You guys are very funny. You know, she's gettin' kinda fat, have you noticed that? Beer belly or something. So who we looking for, public enemy number one? His name is Jack DeVries. Jack DeVries? Jack DeVries? Stockbroker? right. How long you been after him? About a month. A month, huh? Why don't you go buy yourself a drink? Why? 'Cause he's in the hospital... And he's not gonna make it through the night. Which hospital? St. Joseph's. First and main. He ain't going anywhere. What's your hurry? Ugh. Ugh! Ugh! Clear. Still no rhythm. Well, can you feel a pulse? Nothing. OK. Let's try it again. Clear. Doctor, are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK. What happened? I don't know. Doctor... I've got one patient dead on the floor... And the other one... are you trying to tell me... That a man in his condition just picked himself up... And walked the hell out of here? I don't know. Look... He just got up and left when I went to find you. What do you mean, "he just got up and left"? Can I help you? On-call anesthesiologist to the er stat. Anesthesiologist to the er stat. FBI. Mr. Miller has an extremely bad stomach condition... Severe gastritis, and his heart finally deteriorated... To the point where we had to schedule a triple bypass. Yesterday afternoon he had a massive coronary... But today it was as if he just... got up and walked out. I can't really explain it... But I know that that's not the man you're looking for. Jonathan Miller would never do anything to break the law. He is a very kind, very honest gentleman. Yo! Grandpa! What, are you stupid or something? Yo! I'm talking to you, wank. I said I'm... Oh! I'm gonna kill you. Wurgh! Aah! Dur! Ah! Ooh! Ooh! Ow! Ah! Asshole! Arrrgh! Beck, we should get started. On what? I got a news flash for you, DeVries is dead. Who's this, public enemy number 2? His name is Jonathan P. Miller. I need to find him. Get away. Do not put that... Beck... It wasn't funny the first time. This better be good. Quite the desperado. Still handing out the death penalty for unpaid traffic tickets? I don't do traffic tickets. - Beck. - What? You got a body at a record shop over on Melrose and Stanley. Jesus Christ. What is it, a full moon? ...and pictures of everyone. Make sure. OK? How's it going, sarge? Hey, Frankie, how's it going? Did you check the back room? Yeah. It's clear. Nobody across the street saw through the window. Well, what have we got here? Hey, Beck. There's a witness. Apparently she came in right after it happened. She got a pretty good look at the guy. - Where is she? - Right over here. Yeah. He was carrying a radio. Yeah. What are you doing here? I'm just checking up on a couple of traffic tickets. Come here. Sanchez, call the coroner. See if he can get over here sometime today. Right, sir. You got it. That way over there. I see. How tall would you say he was? I don't know what you think this has to do with you but you're out of line. The guy you came here for is dead. Your job here is done. I suggest you get on the next flight back to Seattle. - How we doing here? - Hey, sarge. What do you think? - Is this him? - Yeah, it's him. Oh, great, thanks. His parole officer's... Brem, print this and circulate it. Put out a felony warrant on Jonathan P. Miller, armed and dangerous. Shall we get started? You have that picture of Miller? Use this instead. How did you know about Miller? He used to work with DeVries. Doing what, pulling illegal u-turns? He didn't have a record till 2 weeks ago. He had a record long before that. Not according to our files. No. According to our files. If you want my help you better think about telling me what's going on. Tracking down a criminal who's come to your city. You've been assigned to help me find him. It's that simple. If it's that simple why's the bureau sending you down here? You don't have anything on Miller because he's always changing his identity. The same with DeVries... You didn't have anything on him until a couple of weeks ago... 'Cause that's when you finally caught up with him as DeVries. Before that, he was Arvin J. Lusk in Portland... And before that William Butler in Seattle. Miller does the same thing. This is the closest I've been. He's got to be stopped here before he moves again. We'll take my car. Let's go. Bureau must be paying pretty good these days. Pretty good. Do you mind me asking how much one of these costs? No. How much? I don't know. You don't know. What did you do, steal it? Yeah. Hey. Could you turn that down? Block pick-up, number 3. Elmore, here's your check. One coffee, right? Senator Richard Holt is drawing a crowd wherever he goes these days. The senator, who was expected to announce his candidacy... For president at a fundraiser in Los Angeles tomorrow... Is in town to dedicate a new branch of child help U.S.A. The work of this organization... In bettering the lives of the young people in this community... Stands as an example to the rest of the nation... That, yes, government can and should serve the needs of the small... As well as the giant. Senator, is it true you'll be announcing your campaign plans this Tuesday. Oh, you'll have to wait for next Tuesday for them. Bye, guys. Thank you. And now, capitol hill. An old ship is making new waves. Richard. It's your table, honey. Don't look at me. Hurgh, hurgh, haaah. How far is St. Joseph's from here? About a mile. Why? Which direction? We'll start at the end of the block and work back. Oh, you're calling the shots now, huh? I know how the suspect operates. We don't have much time. How do you know Miller was at the hospital? It's a hunch. I suppose he was there visiting DeVries, right? Yeah. Why don't you just tell me some of this shit... So I don't have to follow you around asking 20 questions? We're supposed to be on the same side. Miller came from the hospital. He was there to see DeVries. Oh, thank you! That is illuminating. Boy, that solves everything. Christ, Miller doesn't have a chance. Hey, why would he come in here and kill a guy... For a lousy 100 bucks and a...and a radio? 'Cause he likes it. He sees something he wants, he steals it. Something gets in his way, he kills it. And right now, he's hiding out in your city. You're talking about Miller. Right. It sounds a lot to me like you're talking about DeVries. You don't think you might be a little confused? So, you impressed? I'm impressed. Ha. Ha ha ha! That's because this car makes an impression. Yeah, but the question is... Do I trade in my Mercedes or do I just hang on to it? I want this car. I'll bet you do, dear. Shall we go to my office? Yeah. Excuse me. Sir, please. Don't. Don't. It's not a toy. Just let me finish with this gentleman... And I'll, uh...I'll show you another car. All right? I want this car. This car is sold. Thank you. Hey, buddy. I'm buying this car. Don't touch it. We get an occasional mental case here but don't worry, I'll take care of it. Eddie! Yo. Shall we? Hey, dickhead. What do you think you're doing? I need the keys. Fine. Out of the car. Don't come back. I won't be as friendly next time. What is your problem? You understand English? Beat it! You want a broken nose, you got it. Ugh! Hmmm! ooh! What was that? It was just a backfire. Not one of yours, I hope. Heh! No way, my friend. No way. Ha ha ha. Go ahead, have some more. It's good stuff. Thank you. How you doin'? Heh heh heh! Feeling good now, huh? Oh, yeah. You'll cream your pants when you do 100 with this baby. 100? In the city? In the city, where else? Anybody can do it on the freeway. Heh heh. I'm busy! I want the car! What the hell is that wacko still doing here? Give me a minute, will ya? What the hell is Eddie doing out there, for god's sake? Eddie! Oh, my god. Urgh. I need the keys. Give him the keys. Hey, man, I just signed the paper. Give him the fuckin' keys! Thank you. Bye. Aah! We got a couple of cars out there with plates on them. One registered, a 308, to Anthony Mercurio. That's the wop. Another one, a Mercedes, registered to anchor imports. I think it's this stiff's here. We don't have a name yet. His wallet was lifted. We're running it down now. What about the owner? Anybody contacted the owner? It's in the works. All right, I want you to contact him... Find out what the inventory is. See if anything is missing. I already got it. They were just finishing a deal for a Red Mondial. It's not here. He took it. How do you know? - He likes Ferraris. - Heh. Put out a want and a felony warrant on the red Ferrari. Gotcha. Come on, come on, I got 4 dead bodies in 4 hours, here. I want Miller and I want him now! Get in. We could go over there. Fuck off! You know what bothers me about these 2 guys, DeVries and Miller? Neither has a criminal record. Both led normal lives till a few days ago and now they're killing people. You read minds or was that just a shot in the dark? I read minds. Oh, yeah? What was I just thinking? That I'm full of shit. Impressive. Not really. Pretty simple to read. Well, I don't read minds and I'd like to know... If you're just doing your job... Or if there's something personal between you and these 2 clowns. I guess you could say it's personal. He killed my partner. Which one? Hmm? Which one killed your partner? Both. I'm surprised the bureau let you stay on the case. I hear they're not big on revenge. What would you do? As a cop? As a man. I lost a partner once. We'll get Miller. Ugh! Uh. Uh. Buckley owns anchor imports, which owns the Mercedes. Let's see if Mr. Buckley has a record. Huh. Looks like this guy's an arms dealer. Carrying a concealed weapon... Possession of narcotics for sale... Firearms possession, felon in possession of... another law-abiding citizen, huh? What the hell is that? A flamethrower, man. Can you believe it? Patrol picked this up off some homeboy on the street. You're kidding. What happened to the good old days of zip guns? Get 2 units out to his home and to his office right away. Sanchez. Homicide. Sure, hold on. Beck, I think it's your wife. Hi...hi. No, I'm sorry. Uh...about 15 minutes. Hold on a sec. What are you doing for dinner? Sorry, I got plans. You know, ladies. Not you, Sanchez. No plans. I'm bringing somebody for dinner. Are you coming? I suppose you live in a castle. Apartment. one bedroom, one bathroom. Want a beer or something? Whatever you're having. "she climbed up on his long tail... "And walked up his back. "When she was comfortable, they walked on. "The sun was very bright. "They reached the end of the forest... "And the fairy Princess began to laugh with joy. "There was the shiny silver castle... "On the top of the mountain..." and here's daddy. Hi, mommy. Hi, baby. How was your day? Interesting. Hi, daddy. How's my girl? Ohh, boy! Did you feed your turtle? Yes. Oh, wait till you see the painting she did in school today. She's got it on the refrigerator already. Who've we got for dinner? FBI. Well, at least they're polite. - Ha. - Ha. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were standing there. Honey, this is Lloyd Gallagher. Lloyd, this is my wife Barbara. It's very nice to have you with us, Lloyd. It's nice to be here, Barbara. I don't mean to disturb you. Oh, no, that's all right. Come on in for a minute. This is our daughter, Juliet. Want to say good night to Mr. Gallagher? Good night, baby. Mwah! ♪ I don't wanna hear about the wrinkles in your bed ♪ ♪ I don't wanna hear about ♪ ♪ Ghosts inside your haunted head ♪ ♪ Inside your haunted head ♪ Well, um... Tommy tells me you're from Seattle. I'm sorry? You're from Seattle? You know, where you're going back to... Soon as you're done here? Yes. I'll go home when I'm finished.

Well, I never heard of that one. Your little girl. Juliet. She's very... Special. Yeah, I think so. You love her. Yes, we love her. She's our daughter. Don't FBI agents love their kids? Tommy, I don't think he... what about you? You married? I was. - Kids? - One. Divorced? My wife is dead. She and my little girl... Were killed by the man who killed my partner. I'm very sorry. Take it all off! Ha ha! I love you, darlin', I love you. That's my wife you're talkin' about. Here's your rusty nail. Hey, Freddie, can I have a bourbon and soda? Yeah, coming up. Hey, buddy.

Let's go, Lloyd. We gotta get going. They found the Ferrari. Brought you some alka-seltzer. It's alka-seltzer. You put it in the water and you drink it. Lloyd, as a friend... Stay away from alcohol.

Well, well, well, what do we got here, huh? Been a long time since we've seen one of these. Really. what the hell is this? This guy looks like he's bled to death. What, from this? Did you find a weapon? No weapon, no I.D., no nothing. This bullshit's getting stale, Tom. Check on the coroner. I'll get you an e.T.A. Sir... Here's some aspirin, sir. Uh, Beck thought you might need it. Oh! Ohh! Ha ha. Ohh. Aah! Aah! Aah, gee, ah. Aah, aah. Ohh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ha ha ha. - Ow! Ow! - Heh heh. What are you doing?! Aah! Ow! Aah! Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha!

There was this guy on the floor. I screamed, and the cops came. You ever seen this guy before? You sure you never seen this guy? Look, I know Brenda. No way she'd have anything to do with a creep like that. Beck. What? We need to find her. You trying to tell me that she's part of this? Hey, Tom. You ain't gonna believe this. We have another stiff. In the parking lot. I don't believe this. Thank you for your help. Good luck. Yo, what the hell's this guy doing with his pants down? What the hell you think he's doing? Busy night, huh, Beck? Getting a little crowded in my Van, you know? Joey, let me know asap when this guy gets posted. - Yeah. Right. - Cliff, get these out. Gotcha. Let's get a DMV on the stolen... Lloyd, come here. Get a good statement from these guys. Can we get another unit... in a span of 12 hours, I've got 5 bodies... Not counting Miller... Who dies because he runs out of blood. A stripper screws some guy to death... Steals his car, and takes off. All of this in 12 hours. I want to ask you, am I crazy... Or does this seem just a little bizarre? Yeah, it's a little bizarre. I knew that. I just wanted to know if you knew that. Let's get outta here. Step out of the car slowly. Keep your hands where I can see them. It's gonna be one of those nights. Watch it! Shit! Ho-ly smoke. Officers need help, suspect is armed and headed eastbound... I'd say we're going the right way. There it is. You bitch. Shit! God damn it! Why don't you try for one of the tires? What the hell do you think I'm trying to do? You think this is easy, why don't you try it? Son of a... Hold the wheel. You hold the goddamn wheel. You wanted to... what the hell you doing? Jesus! You're out of your goddamn mind, do you know that? You're fuckin' nuts. I'm going in. I'll cover you. Might be safer if you didn't. Fine. I won't cover you. All right, cover me. D'you want me to fuckin' cover you or not? I need you to cover me. Fine. I'll cover you. Jesus Christ. She's bleeding to death, for Christ's sake! Why doesn't she go down? We've gotta get to her before she dies. Why don't we wait till after she's dead? Ah...aah! Unh. Unh! Agh. Uh! You think it's over now. You're wrong. I'm not coming... out yet. I'll kill you first. Let's go. Roy, come... god! Lieutenant. Yeah, Willis, what's your status? Broad just jumped, round back. All right, gentlemen, let's do this by the... go on ahead. Halt! FBI. Get away from the body! Party's over, pal. She's dead. She's dead, lieutenant. Hell of a night, huh? Who was here? Who touched the body? She's dead, Mr. Gallagher. It's over. Nelson, this is Willis. Check on the coroner's arrival for me, will ya? Better bring in the robbery/homicide shooting team. What's goin' on up there? You want us up there? Hey, you wanna make some room there? Move out of the way. Come on. Joey! Hey, look, it's none of my business... But the lady had about 15 bullet holes in her. You guys like making my job miserable, huh, Beck? Come on. You should really go to the ambulance now. Just give me a minute. Forensics team's still on the first floor. It's not over, is it? No. I want an explanation. Explanation won't help you. I've worked homicide for 13 years... And I've seen a lot of strange shit... But I have never seen anything like this. Now, you seem to know what's going on and I don't. And you're gonna tell me. Explanation's not gonna help you. I'll decide that. Then I'm sorry. Hey! Don't you walk away from me. What I'm after is still out there... And I don't know where to start. Cliff. Tommy, what happened to you, man? Arrest him. Arrest him? Book him. Doc, can I give you a hand over there? I've got the diagram here. Lloyd...I've gotta take you downtown. Boss' orders. Come on. Woodfield, what are you doing up so late? Having a ball. Heh. Hey, I heard you took one. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. Hey. I woke you, huh? I'm fine. I'm fine. If I wasn't fine... Somebody else would call you, wouldn't they? I got into a bit of a scrape, but it's no big deal. I'm just calling so you won't worry. I'll be home soon. I'll, uh... I'll be home as soon as I can. I love you too. Bye. I hope you know what you're doing, busting a fed. Let me worry about that. How's the arm? Hey, it's a scratch. What the hell's this, your press secretary? This is the stuff I got from Lloyd... firearms, personal I.D... And who in the hell knows what this is? Must be some kind of special FBI toy. Do me a favor, drop it off at the lab. We'll see what they can figure out in the morning. Gotcha. No problem. - Cliffy? - Yeah? Thanks, partner. Take care of that arm, huh? I got that information you wanted. OK. Seattle FBI says agent Lloyd Gallagher... Was killed in a forest fire about a month ago... With a friend of his named stone. Robert stone. They were hunting in Olympic National Forest... The weekend they had that big forest fire. Bureau figured stone was dead. Never found his body. Just figured it burned up in the fire. Is that all? I had them wire me a picture of stone. Evidently Mr. stone has taken over the identity of his dead friend. If you don't need me, I'm going home. Brem? Good work. Aw! Excuse me, sarge. Where do you want him? Take the cuffs off him. You want me to stay? No. Crazy thing. I was starting to like you. Sit down. I checked with the FBI in Seattle. Lloyd Gallagher is dead. Your real name is Robert stone. That's about all we know about you... Except for the fact that you're driving a stolen Porsche... Which is probably about the only true thing... That you've told us so far. So why don't we just have a little talk? Why don't you tell me who you are and what you're doing here? Please don't ask me that. Don't give me that! I have had it with you. What do you think this is, some kind of a game? You think you can waltz into this town... Turn my department upside-down... Endanger the lives of my men? I am tired of you jerking me around. I want answers! I wanna know why it takes 15 shots... To take down some zoned-out stripper. I wanna know why 3 law-abiding citizens... All of a sudden go crazy and start killing people. I want answers, and I want them now! Miller, the stripper, DeVries were the same... And it's not human. Excuse me? I have been after it for a long time. Now it's here, on earth, in your city. Oh, boy. Are we talking spacemen here? The way it works is it finds a body... Gets inside, uses it to move around. It stays in that body until the body is so damaged... It has to find another body. That's the only time I can kill it, when it's between bodies. I missed my chance when it came out of the stripper. It found another body and changed before I got there. So now we don't know who the spaceman is. No. But I don't have to look for it anymore. It knows I'm here. It'll come after me. Beck, I need my weapon. That's the only thing that can kill it. So the spaceman is the one that killed your partner, your wife... The one that you've been tracking for the past... - 9 years. - 9 years. Your time. Our time. I guess a career in the police... Didn't really prepare you for this, did it? Yes, it did. We'll try again later. It's OK. It's OK. Good morning, lieutenant. Morning. What's eating him? I thought you said he wasn't coming in today. Heh. Yes, sir, you can. He didn't know what hit him, until bang! Hey, John. What do you say? I thought you weren't coming in today. I have work to do. Aha. Well. Oh, sorry, this is lieutenant Masterson. Carol Miller, Senator Holt's assistant. Agents Stadt and Lowe. They're handling security for the senator's speech today, John. Holt. The one everyone applauds. Heh. We'd like to think so. Where's the speech? Park Plaza, you know that. Yeah, 5. 5 guys in the lobby, I think, Carol. Take it easy, all right? Sure. I'll be fine. How you doing, sarge? Hey, Frankie, how are you? Hey! Hey! there's a bomb! Where did that come from? We've had an explosion in ballistics. - Let's get somebody down there. - Is anybody hurt? There's a lot of smoke in the corridor. Get a fire unit over here. Come on! Move! Move! Get a fire extinguisher in here. Let's move! Get out of there. Get him out of there. What happened? What the hell is goin' on? Hey, what's goin' on here? You! You? Lieutenant what's goin' on around here? Where's the other one? What other one? The one you were with. Lloyd? I locked him up. You know that. I wanna talk to him. What is this? What are you doing with... listen, I already shot you once. I can hardly wait to do it again. Now, let's go. - Hey, Beck? - Stay back. Lieutenant, what's goin' on? Agh! - Get back! Take cover! - We got a man down. Tom! Tom, you OK? Stay back, Cliff, it's not Masterson. Seal this corridor. Get him outta here. Now, Beck! - Agh! - Freeze! Shit! We just dumped the lieutenant, man. Get an ambulance. Sanchez, stay away from him. aah! - Brooks! - Yeah. - Give me your gun. - You can't do that! Give me your fuckin' gun! It's in my waistband, man! Get a shotgun and seal off the stairwell. Buzz the gate. Get me into c-8. What the hell's going on here? Just open the fuckin'... Masterson has flipped out and... He's shooting up the station, all right? Now, open the gate. You have to check your piece, Beck. Give me the keys, Joe. Buzz the gate, Joe. Buzz the fuckin' gate! And watch out for Masterson! Hey, I need a phone call. I just saw Masterson dump 2 cops. He took 6 hits at point-blank range... And he's not going down. Is Masterson... Is he dead? The real Masterson. Yeah. You're gonna need this. Hey, what's goin' on? Jesus Christ! Let me in. I can't do that, lieutenant. Hey, put that down. Hey, don't do that. Jeez! Get down. - You're hit. Here. - I know. Alhague. Yes? Before I kill you, I'm curious. How did you find me? You left an angry partner for dead on Altair. A mistake. That's what it said. Agh. Die, you fucker! Son of a bitch! Why don't you use that goddamn thing? Not yet. You said it was the only thing that could kill it. What are you waiting for? It's not that simple. Alhague. How do you like being human? It's all right. Better than being Altarian. Altarians are a filthy people. We could take over this place if we wanted. They have nothing here to stop us. Yo, hippy, what kind of dude are you? Aah! Oh, man! OK, what's going on, man? Bye. Die! L...L...Look at that! Let me out! He's gonna change soon. I'm gonna be there. Who the hell are you? Do you feel pain? - Yeah. - Yeah? Why didn't you use that thing? You said it was the only thing that would kill him and you didn't use it. Wrong composition. Doesn't work on human flesh. Whoa. Hey, open up the door, man. - Man, where are you going? - He's from outer space. Nobody knows it. It's crazy. These drugs are kickin' up on you, man. Dude's from outer space. Seal this off. Get back in there. Back. Cover me. You go low. On 3. 1...2...3. Freeze. Don't shoot! Don't move! Freeze! - Is it him? - No. Beck, what's going on? - Is he dead? - Yeah. Beck, what the hell is going on? You see anybody leave this room? I don't know. Willis. He said he was going to get a medic. Beck, who did this to Masterson? Not Willis. I'm sorry. I think we better find him. - Senator Holt... - Senator Holt... will you answer some questions, please, senator? What about the scandal? What do you wanna do about the animal rights protesters? Beck. Where? Jesus Christ. Jean Simpson's free lunch program... freeze! Don't move! Hold it right there. Beck. LAPD. Who the hell's he? Gallagher. FBI. It's OK. He's one of mine. Beck, what the hell are you doing? Code red. Code red. Sir, there may be an assassin in the building. We're gonna take you out the back entrance.

I got two downed officers here. Freeze! Drop it! Agh! Both of you in the closet, now! Uhh! Aah! Who are you? Who are you, god damn it? What do you want? You all right, sir? Let's get the senator out. All right. Let's move out. All right, everybody move. Get him out of here. Watch that guy. Uniform, seal this off. Hey. You can't go through here. Police business. Unh. Did we get him? Yeah. - Question. - Yes. Has any motive been established as to why detective Willis... Would want to assassinate Senator Holt? Lieutenant Flynn? The depart... the department is conducting an investigation... But at this time we have no motive. Yes. Sir. Senator, do you still intend to run for president? The senator will discuss his campaign plans... After he has had adequate time to fully reflect on the situation. I want to be president. What's that, senator? I want to be president. All right!
