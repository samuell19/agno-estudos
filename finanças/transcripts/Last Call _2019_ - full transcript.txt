Thank you. Hello? Hey, Miriam. 10:30, is he not home yet? Yeah, he's supposed to come straight home. Okay, let me call Lindsay and see if he's at Ryan's house. Okay, I'll call you right back. Dammit, Gregory. Hi Lindsay, it's Beth. I'm just wondering if the boys are at your place because Gregory's not at home and he was supposed to be home about an hour ago. So just call me back on my cell when you can, bye. Want more? I'm good. Sure? Mhmm. Check? Yeah. Actually, could you sell me a bottle? Hello? Shit. Can you give me those? Yeah, all right. All right. I got something down here. How's that? - Work? - Yeah. I'll get you a bag. Thanks. There you go. Get some change. No, that's all yours. No, come on. No, the tip's on you man. You sure? Yeah, thanks. Thanks, bro. Have a good night. You too. Hi Miriam, sorry, my phone died. Okay, I just walked into work, any news? Okay, well. Oh shit, can you hold on one second? Okay. Hello? Hi, I'm so, so sorry, I forgot to disarm the security system. Okay, I'm here. I'm gonna find a charger, plug in my phone, call Ryan's mom back, see if he's there. And actually, in the meantime can you call me back at 866-555-8221? Yeah, it's 555-8221. Okay and I know I'm a broken record at this point, Miriam, but I don't know why he didn't come home. He was supposed to be there so. You are a godsend. Okay, I'll call you the second I hear anything. Okay, bye-bye. Hi Jeff, it's Beth. Look, I have a thing that might not be a thing but I was just wondering if there was anyone else available to come in tonight to cover me? Yeah, just call me back at work, I'm here, bye. Hey, it's Emily. Leave a message after the beep. You know what to do. Fucking kidding me. Hey Miriam, is he home? Miriam? Hello? Hi Miriam, did you just call? Oh. Okay, is he home? Okay. I'll talk to you soon, I guess. Okay thanks, yeah, bye. Hi, you've reached Our business hours are Monday to Friday, 08:00 a.m. to 05:00 p.m.. Hello? Miriam? Hello. Hello. Sorry sir, we're closed. You're closed? Yeah, the night programs don't even go this late and I'm only here a few nights a week. You're a volunteer? Well, with what they pay me it kind of feels like it, yes. Okay, but are you working tonight? Yeah, but I actually don't usually answer the phones. Okay. Sir? Who's answering the phones? No one, no one tonight. Sir, can I take a message for you or something? A message? Yeah, they'll call you back tomorrow or I guess when they're in next. People leave messages? Yeah. What do they say, I need help? Yeah, sure. And then you call people back? Well, I don't. I'm just a student. Like you're in training? Yes. Yeah. I'm in a program here. Sir? I'm sorry. I'm confused. You're in training but you're by yourself and you don't answer the phone so what if people call? It's not my problem. They'll leave a message. Look, listen sir, I need to leave this line open in case someone calls me about my son. Is your son okay? He won't be if he doesn't get his ass home. And how old is he? He is 12 going on 20. Troublemaker? No, not exactly. He when to go see a movie with his friend and now he's not home to watch his little brother and my sitter has to stay late and I don't even pay her, so that makes me feel terrible. Hello? It sounds like... Well, you know what, spaghetti nights are supposed to be so simple. What is spaghetti night? Oh, it's something that me and my parents do every Thursday but being a single mom with two jobs and school, it doesn't always pan out. Well, I mean, it's just spaghetti. I'm sure they'll get over it. No, that's not the thing. They rotate picking activities every week and Gregory really wanted to go see the ballgame and my friend got us tickets I could never afford and of course someone called me in to come to work and I really need the cash. But he got to see a movie? Yeah, that I had to pay for, and his friend out of guilt. Plus popcorn, you know. Come to think of it, I'm not even making that much extra money on this shift so I should've just said no. I'm so sorry, sir. I completely just unloaded on you there. That's okay, kids have that effect. Yeah, you have kids? I used to. Used to? How old is your other boy? He's seven. Look sir, can I take a message for you or something? I was just calling the number to talk to someone. Can you hold on one second? Hello? Hi Jeff, yes, it's Beth. Look, I have a thing with my son. He's not home and I was just wondering if there was anybody that could come in and cover my shift tonight in case I have to go find him? Yeah, just hold on one second. Miriam, just checking is he home? Okay, I'll call you back later. Yeah. Jeff, he is not home. I know. Yeah. Okay. I'll talk to you soon, bye. Oh fuck, shit. Hello? Hello? Hello? Sir, I'm sorry. Hello? Hello. Yes, I'm sorry. What is this? Excuse me? Is this 1866-555-8221? Yeah. Where did I call? Gateway. What's that? Gateway Career Center. What's so funny? I've been staring at that number for a long time. Okay. They got up one of those posters? Oh yeah, the bus ads. No, one of those, you're not alone, if you need help call this number? I'm sorry, sir, what do you need help with? Today's a bad day. It's been a pretty shitty year and I just didn't wanna feel alone. You were calling a helpline? Yeah. I thought so. Just wanna be talking with someone. Hello? Yes. I thought maybe you hung up on me. No. No. I just, I didn't know what to say. Is your son okay? What? Your son, you said you were waiting for someone to call about him and then you put me on hold. I know, I was just calling someone to cover my shift tonight. Well, I sincerely hope that everything's okay with your son. Sir, are you okay? You're slurring your words. I was at the bar earlier. Okay, so your drunk? I can't even tell anymore. Are you sure that's a good idea? Yeah. Okay. You go out much? No. No, I don't have the time or the money. The money part I get but don't anyone tell you that you don't have time to drink. I spend most of my time working so I can make a better life for my boys who I never see. So I hope they appreciate that one day. They will and then they won't. And after therapy they might again. Please don't say that. Therapy was the only hope I had for my daughter to talk to me. Your daughter doesn't talk to you? Yeah, she lives in another city. Oh, is that why you said you used to have kids? Is it? No. I had a son. Okay. He died. I'm so, so sorry. No don't. Some days it feels like it was a lifetime ago today. It was four years ago today. I mean, I can't imagine. If anything happened tot my boys... You'd drink a lot, call a helpline? Yeah, I probably would. So you're drinking right now? No. Okay. What's your name? Scott. Scott, hi Scott. Wait, why do you need my name? I just wanna know who I'm talking to. I'm sorry, you're working and I'm bothering you. No Scott, it's totally fine. Scott, do you have anyone else that you could talk to like friends or family? No, my family doesn't want anything to do with me. Co-workers or a girlfriend? You think someone calls a suicide hotline if people care about them? Are you thinking about suicide? - I should let you go. - Scott, no. It's absolutely fine. Do you think about that a lot? Did you get your shift covered? No. I actually should keep cleaning. Cleaning? I clean the college. You're the janitor? Well, night custodian if you wanna get technical. Okay, so talking to a student's perfectly fine but if she happens to moonlight scrubbing toilets, that's where you draw the line? No, I'm laughing at me. Why? Hang on a second. Believe me, I've been unemployed for years. I've got no room to judge. Okay, so you don't work? No, not for a while. And what did you used to do? I was a corporate asshole. Okay. If I tried to explain what my job was I'd put us both to sleep. Your boys, what does their dad do? Oh, I don't know. I mean, my wild guess would be absolutely nothing. He's not around? No. He left about 30 seconds after I found out I was pregnant with my second boy. If I could divorce him, trust me, I would. I just have to find him. You can divorce him and you don't have to find him. How does that work? My wife divorced me without me sighing a damn thing. Oh, well that's good news. Not about you getting divorced but you know what I mean. Yeah, I know what you mean. So you were married? That's a very important step towards divorce. Right, and what was she like, your ex? Amanda? Yeah, Amanda. She was complicated. Well, was she a good mom at least? The best. And your daughter lives with her? I can't do this. Scott? Hello? Scott? Scott, I can hear you. You know, I never really had a beat on Amanda the whole time we were married. Look Scott... Yeah. I really wanna talk to you but you can't just put the phone down like that, it kind of scares me. You know what I mean? Sorry. Hello? She was always one step ahead of me on everything. It's like she knew stuff. Like a psychic? Almost. It was hard to describe. I asked her about it once. She told me I had no idea what I was talking about. But then she shot me this look that said, I know exactly what you're talking about. You'll never figure me out. It's was kind of sexy. You got something to chase after. Then it started to feel more like a trap. She'd give me one of those knowing looks and I'd start wracking my brain trying to figure out what I'd done. You know, like those shows where people confess to committing a crime they never committed 'cause the police have them so spun around, convinced of their own guilt that they go, oh shit, maybe I did do something. So did you do something? No. - What do you mean? - I'm sorry. Scott, do you have any hobbies? Hobbies? Yeah, things that you like to do? I like to make cocktails. Okay. You like cocktails? Yeah. Sure. Ever had a Manhattan? No, I don't think so. What's a Manhattan? A Manhattan in my opinion is the best drink to order at a new bar or if you got a new bartender 'cause it's simple but it's easy to mess up. If they make you a good Manhattan you could pretty much trust them with any other drink they make. There's only a few ingredients. - You have one new message. - It's whiskey. Hi, it's Lindsay. Sorry I missed you earlier. The boys aren't here. Let me know if they turn up there and I'll do the same. Okay, bye. Why? 'Cause you bruise the alcohol. That's a real thing? Oh yeah. How do you bruise the alcohol? Well, I mean, it's just a term. It means you cause the alcohol to oxidize. Some people say it makes the drink taste sharper but those people are idiots. Well, you'll have to make me one sometime. Mm-mm. Do you have any other hobbies? No, not really. What about things you and Amanda like to do, travel? Amanda, she was always smarter than me and she knew it too. She would push all my buttons. It was like she knew things about me before even I did. Like what? Like Katie. Who's Katie? This woman who started at my work. - Okay. - She was young and pretty and all the guys took notice. And thinking back, I'm not really sure she was that pretty or if it was that thing where someone seems hot because they're hotter than everyone else at work. Yeah. And then you put them out in the real world and they may not even be in the top 20%, you know. Yeah, well I've definitely known a few guys like that. See. Anyway, Katie had been at work for maybe a month before we had this big Christmas party. Amanda took one look at her and said, watch out for that one, she likes you. I thought she was crazy. Then the next week at work the guys from the county came up and said Katie was asking about me after the party. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Then I started taking the long way from my office to the break room, decided to go past her desk and make eye contact and she'd smile and that would be it. And then she'd say hello and I'd say hello. And before you know it I'm spending 20 minutes a day talking to her at her desk. And what would you guys talk about? I couldn't even tell you. It's what we didn't talk about. I hadn't had so much sexual tension with someone ever, not even with Amanda. Probably because we had sex the night we met, hard to build tension like that. So did you have an affair? What? Jesus. I'm sorry, did you? No. Oh. I mean, I thought about it. - Right. - Too much. I decided going out for drinks with the guys after work 'cause I knew Katie would go. Well, it sounds like you and Katie had a really good connection. Have you talked to her recently or reached out? When Amanda found out Katie was one of the guys she... She what? I mean, I knew I was probably doing something wrong but Amanda made me feel like I robbed a bank or something. So what did you do? Stopped going out after work. I didn't really have much of a choice. No, that's probably a good idea. So that's what my ex was like. Then why did you guys get divorced? She couldn't, after our son. After what? What about you, your baby daddy sounds like a real piece of shit. Was he always that way or did he slowly become that way like the rest of us? No. You know what, we were really young when we met. He was my first love and I held onto that a lot longer than I should have. Yeah. Men are sometimes pre-programed to disappoint. Well, you don't sound so bad, Scott. I'm worse. Why do you say that? That's what I've been told. Yeah, by who, Amanda? Her too. Scott, why did you call a helpline tonight? You can talk to me. We can take advantage of the anomenity that we have. The anonymity? Whatever, you know what I mean. It's much freer to talk to someone without any history or judgment. You sound like one of those helplines. But I'm being serious. I know. So you had a son? Yes. And how old was he when he died? Scott? Scott? Scott? I'm sorry. Scott, if you can hear me, I didn't mean... Shit. Hi there, what can I do to help you tonight? Hi, I'm on the phone with someone who I think is depressed and might harm themselves and I feel like anything I say may set them off, so I'm not really sure what to do. Make sure they agree that they aren't going to harm themselves. Okay. Keep them on the phone until you're sure that they are safe. Okay, and how do I do that? Are they still on the line now? I made a deal with the universe. What? As I was saying, make sure you keep them on the phone line. That's number one. I called the helpline so they can talk me out of it. I'd say the universe has made itself perfectly clear. Talk you out of what, Scott? Scott, are you thinking about killing yourself? Just letting go. Letting go of what? Everything. Fear, hope, just accepting. Accepting what, Scott? That no one wants me here. No, I want you here. You don't know me. No, but I do. I do want you here and I know that your daughter - would want you here. - No, she doesn't. Yes, she would. Scott, when I was young my father abandoned our family and I hated him. But there was always a little part of me that wished he was still around. And I know that your daughter feels that way too. Not anymore. How old is she? 17. She's graduating. That's exciting. She asked me not to be there. She said that? That's the thing no one tells you about rock bottom, it doesn't exist. There's just harder levels buried underneath all the shit and they break you into a million pieces and you just keep... Scott, I'm not really sure what you mean. She sent me a letter a few months ago. Okay, she sent you a letter. That's great, maybe that's just how she wants to communicate with you. I don't think so. Why would you say that? I tried writing her back. Okay, and? They all came back, return to sender. All of them? Yeah. Did you have the right address? Yes. Sorry. I recognized the handwriting on the envelopes and she said everything she wanted to say. And what did she say? Nothing. Scott? You want me to read you the letter? You don't have to. No, I'll read you the letter. Okay. Dad, with my graduation approaching, I've been really thinking about it and I'm asking you not to attend. Mom and I are just starting to be happy again and every time you come around it cancels that out. Mom cries for days afterwards. And you're always drunk and it's embarrassing. All my friends know about you and Dylan. I hate the way they look at you. It makes me look at you different too. I'm going to college in the fall where no one knows me. I can just me Emily and not that poor girl or that man's other kid or Dylan's sister. I need that. I'm sorry if this hurts you but I have to start looking out for myself. Signed, Emily Brooks. She's going by her mom's maiden name now, that's fun. Why would she say all those things? Because she hates me. No. No Scott, I'm sure she doesn't hate you. I'm sure she's hurting. I'm the one that's hurting her. Why are you hurting her? It's not her fault. She will listen to her mom and aunts say nothing good about me, even I'm starting to believe it. Believe what? I'm a monster. I'm a terrible person, a failure as a father. Scott. I was in the car too, did you know that? What car? I was in a coma for five days. Amanda had to make the decision to take Dylan off life support while I was in a coma and she never forgave me for that, among other things. I'm so, so sorry Scott. I don't know - what to say. - Did you know that the Sazerac was the first cocktail? What? Yeah, it was invented in New Orleans. This guy, Peychaud or however you pronounce that, he was selling these bitters and he mixed it with French brandy and made the first cocktail. Scott. What? Do you think it would be useful to talk about your son? No. Dylan was your son? Yes. And how old was he? I'm done talking about him. Why? I've talked about him enough for 10 lifetimes. I talk about him with my parents. I talked about him with my brothers. I talked about him with the guys at AA. The only one who won't talk to me about him is Amanda because she blames me. Why does Amanda blame you? I was out after work. I hadn't gone out in months and I only went because I knew Katie would be there. Amanda called to say she was running late and couldn't get Dylan from soccer practice and could I do it? I knew there'd be a fight if I... Okay, but that doesn't make it your fault. He wasn't wearing a seatbelt. He was complaining about it choking him and I probably just let it go. It wasn't far from the soccer field to the house. Yeah, and accidents happen, you know. No, no, no, no, - don't say that. - But it's true, Scott. You don't get to say that to me. People say stupid shit like that to me - all the time. - I'm sorry, Scott. - I'm just trying to help you. - Accidents happen. It happens for a reason. God works in mysterious ways. Well, fuck you. It should've been me that died. It should've been me. Why do I get to go on living, huh? Scott? Scott? Scott? Hello? Hello? Hello? Shit. F. Come on, you fucking coward. Come on. 911, what's your emergency? Hi, I just got off the phone with someone who I think might be planning to kill themselves and I'm just not sure what to do. Okay ma'am, where is he? He's at his house. What's the address? I don't know. Do you have his phone number? No, I don't. What is his name? His name is Scott. Scott, last name? - I don't know. - I'm sorry ma'am, if you don't know his full name, his address or any No, I understand what you're saying but you don't understand, okay. He called me and now he hung up and I don't know what to do. Ma'am, if he calls again get an address so we can send some help. Right now I have to keep this line open, okay. No, please? Ma'am, I have to keep this line open. No, but please just help me, I don't know what to do. Are you still there? Ma'am? Okay. Hello? Hi, Amanda Brooks? Yes, who is this? Yes hi, my name is Beth and I was just wondering if your ex-husband's name is Scott? I don't have anything to do with him anymore. I completely understand that but I just wanna let you know that I have an emergency. I have to go. Please don't. Scott. Okay. Hey, it's Emily. Leave a message after the beep. You know what to do. Hi Em, it's dad. You home? I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, please, please. Hello? Hello? Sorry I yelled. - Sorry. - What'd you say? I'm sorry I yelled. No, that's fine. I was just really upset that you hung up. I didn't. I accidentally pulled the phone cord out of the wall. Okay Scott, do you think you could give me your number in case we get disconnected again? Have you ever had a Rob Roy? No. It's like a Manhattan but you make it with Scotch. It was actually invented in Manhattan. The bartender named it after a opera about a Scottish folk hero. Scott, are you still drinking? Maybe. Do you think that we could keep talking without anymore drinks? Do you think that's a good idea? Yeah. Hello? Do you ever think about what happens when we die? No. No, I don't. I do all the time. Scott, maybe we can talk about something else like your daughter and maybe where she's going. Do you never think about what happens when you die? No, I don't really like to think about that. Nobody likes to think about the bad shit happening. That's why no one knows what to do when it does. Scott, what's your address? I don't believe in hell, unless this is it which it makes sense. Scott, where do you live? I think Einstein was close. Einstein? Einstein said that "Energy can't be created or destroyed," so I figure our energy just keeps on going after we kick it. Scott, look... It just keeps on going, doing whatever it was doing before I got here, I guess. Scott, I want you to listen okay. - I know I could never - I've never remembered - stuff from before. - Understand how this feels. But it's in a different language. Scott, I know - that you were the driver. - Or frequency or something. And I know that you were drunk. And I know that you feel hopeless right now but I want you to know Like how a radio can get - all the stations - That you don't have - to be ashamed - But it has to be tuned - to the right ones. - And that I would like to talk to you so if you could give me your number for your address I would love to come meet you face to face. Maybe I could come over tomorrow? No, I can't tomorrow. Why? Why can't you tomorrow? I figured if there was something after this world that - Scott. - Our loved ones or whomever would send messages - or signals. - Scott, when you weren't on the phone I was really worried about you. - Then I thought, well - Okay, and I want you - to know that I'm here - What would I do, maybe they If you need someone to listen and that you don't - have to feel ashamed. - Send them and we just don't have the right radio to hear it. Scott, can you just answer me? Like to be in the middle of nowhere and just trying to send those messages - and know that no one's - Scott, I need you - to tell me where you live? - Gonna hear them. Okay. Maybe it's like when we send stuff into space. Scott, I would like to come over and meet you. We don't know who or if anyone's ever gonna hear us. Scott? - Scott there's still so much. - Unless they do and they send a message back it would be long after we're gone. Scott, there's still so much - I don't know about you - Our children's children And I would like to get to know you a little bit more, okay. They'll be the ones that hear them. And it'll be just like it is now. - Just like what is? - Just like there was nothing. Scott, there isn't nothing, okay. I'm here and I wanna talk to you, okay, and I want you to know that I care about you, okay, and that you're not alone. You're so nice. I wish I could talk to someone who didn't know for once, who didn't see me like that. I'm so sorry. Just one last time. Scott please don't say things like that, okay. Okay? You don't have to say things like that, okay, you're safe. And I care about you, I really do. No, you don't. You don't have to be ashamed. I should've had the affair, you were right. Why would you say that? And planned stuff with Katie, everything would be okay. Scott, don't say things like that okay. That's not true. It's true. No. Amanda would divorce me and we would've talked and Emily would probably disown me. But Dylan would still be alive. Scott. Don't you worry. I want you to know that you don't have to feel hopeless, okay. Can you just tell me that you're gonna be okay? Can you say those words to me? Who cares? I care. No you don't. I really, really do care. I really do. Okay? I don't feel good. You don't feel good? No. The pills. What? Scott, did you take pills? Scott? Scott, did you take pills? Scott? Scott, please answer me okay? Scott? Scott, are you okay? Scott? Scott, just talk to me okay. You're gonna be okay, I promise. - I promise. - Hello? Hi Amanda, please don't hang up. Please, I have Scott on the other line and I need his address, okay. I already told you, - I don't have his address. - I understand that but this is an emergency. I think he's gonna kill himself, please. You need to call the police. I did call the police. They need an address or a phone number, okay, Amanda. I do not have an address or phone number, I'm sorry. Please, you don't understand. I don't have it. There's nothing I can do, - I don't have it. - Scott? Amanda, please. Emily, is Emily there? How do you know Emily? She wrote him a letter. She has his address, please go get her. What? - Go get her. - Okay. Okay. - Scott? - Emily? - What? - Did you write - a letter to your dad? - Scott, I'm here okay. - Why? - 'Cause this random lady on the phone is saying you wrote a letter to your dad. She needs his address, apparently you know it 'cause you've written letters to him. Amanda, please hurry up. Just give me a second. Please hurry up. Scott, just say something. She did write a letter and I didn't know she had. Yes, just give me the address please? 1474 Main Street, Upper Midwest Side 1722 Cherio Hill. Yes. Okay. Sorry, I didn't know she was sending him letters. You'd have to talk to her. Scott? Scott? Say something, okay. Just tell me you're gonna be okay. 911, what's your emergency? You have to send an ambulance to 1474 Main Street, Apartment 1722 Cherio. Please hurry up. Just please state your emergency? Yes, I'm currently on the phone with someone who I think is trying to kill themselves. He took a lot of pills and he's been drinking and he's not responding so please hurry. What's his name? His name is Scott. Scott Richardson. Okay, just repeat the address? Yes, it's 1474 Main Street, Apartment 1722 Cherry Hill. Please just hurry. You don't understand. Are you on the phone with him right now? Yes, I'm currently on the phone but he's not responding to me. I don't know what to do. Please stay calm. Help is on its way right now. Yes, thank you. Scott? Scott? Scott, just talk to me. Just say something, okay. Tell me that you're gonna be okay. Say those words, just tell me you're gonna be okay? Scott? Scott? Scott, who are you talking to? Scott? Scott, just say are you gonna be okay? Scott, please don't do this to me. Please don't do this to me, Scott. Scott, just think about Emily, okay, she doesn't want you to go. She doesn't want you to go. Scott? Scott, please don't go. Scott? Scott, say something please? Scott. Scott, help is on the way, okay. Help is on the way. If you can hear me, they're coming to help you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to do. Scott! Please, please, please, please. Scott? Scott? Scott, answer the door.
