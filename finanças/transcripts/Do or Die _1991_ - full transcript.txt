(seagull squawking) (water splashing) (lively synthesizer music) (gun fires) - Two, three, clap to the left. Two, three, clap to the right. Two, three, clap. Get your hips involved. And to the right. Company hall, thank you. This is all for the benefit of Molokai Children's Hospital Fund, folks. A big hand. (upbeat drum music) (chanting in foreign language) (audience cheers) (gentle synthesizer music) - Excuse me, ladies. Somebody very important outside would like to see you. - I have made a six-figure donation to the children's hospital fund in your names. It's designated posthumously. I know you two are government agents. You have caused my organization so much misery, grief. I am compelled to kill you. (both grunting) - You kill us, you won't get 10 yards from here. - Please, don't think of me so crude. I am a sportsman, a hunter. I enjoy a good challenge. How about you? - Can't get enough of a good challenge. - It's what I live for. - Enough of this. I have hired six teams of assassins. They are the very best. You are their quarry. - Why go to all this trouble to kill us? - Your skills are legendary. It would undermine my reputation for fair play if we should end your illustrious lives without first giving you an opportunity to use all your resources which you have so painstakingly cultivated. - So, this challenge, this game, is to satisfy your sense of honor? - My sense of humor. - You're mad. - You are dead! The game begins at noon tomorrow. You will know all you need to know about me by game's end, or perhaps you will learn more than you need to know if you die before the game ends. I shall be watching with great interest. - Who are you? - Masakana Kaneshiro. You Americans like to call me Kane. (both gasp) (elbow thuds) (man groans) (kick thuds) (man groans) (Kane yells) - I hurt my ankle. - Not now. Later. - [Donna] Come on, lean on me. (mysterious synthesizer music) - This hot water's gonna be great for my ankle. Besides, don't you do your best thinking in here? - Do you have a problem with that? - No, I was just checking. - I think it's time to inform Lucas. (phone beeps) (phone rings) - I want you both out of there by dawn. Head over here to Las Vegas. Norm G's doing business about 20 miles outside of town. He has a device I know will come in handy. - Where should we go from there? - I'm gonna need some time to formulate a plan. Norm will give you your orders when you get there. Donna, if Kane revealed himself to you, he intends to see you dead. You're in a do or die situation. - Well, it won't be the first time. - You ladies are in some hot water, so cover your ass. (gentle synthesizer music) (computer beeps) - The laser microchip Lew attached to Donna Hamilton's wristwatch transmits a signal to us via satellite. Our team will have a microchip as well. (computer beeping) I've programmed the computer to respond to the command via electronic tracking mechanism. The red light represents the two women. The green light represents our team. - Perfect. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) -Yes? - Hey, man. I've returned to my headquarters in Honolulu. - We're ready here, sir. - Good. Let the games begin. (device beeping) - This is gonna be easy. - Yeah. (helicopter whirring) - [Donna] Nicole, check out that helicopter. - [Nicole] What the hell is he up to?! Donna, he's got a gun! Duck! (thrilling synthesizer music) (gun firing) (guns firing) - Go around and drop! (guns firing) There! (guns firing) (Nicole yelps) (guns firing) (screams) (gun firing) (screams) (guns firing) (rocket whooshes) (explosion booms) (metal clattering) - Good shot, Nicole. - Nothing to it. - Come on. - It's only 8:00 a.m. and that son of a bitch said we had until noon! - Look at the bright side, we won the first round. (gentle synthesizer music) - Shiatsu helps to prevent illness. It's a wonderful tension breaker. It calls forth all the innate self-curative forces. It helps to maintain a healthy body just with the strength of my touch. - I have a clear picture of the effects of your touch. It arouses all of my senses. - Yes. You will feel a great self-awareness between the points I touch and the spirit of your gorgeous body. (computer beeping) We'll finish shiatsu later, hm? (computer beeping) (explosion booms) Team One is terminated. The ladies are very good and survived the first test. (gentle synthesizer music) - We're like sitting ducks up here. - We'll be landing in Honolulu in just a few minutes. - I'm really afraid this time. - You have every right to be, Nicole. Honolulu Tower, this is November niner niner 786 requesting permission to land. - [Man] Roger, you're clear. Runway six west. (gentle synthesizer music) - We'd better hurry. We've only got an hour to change our clothes and catch our plane to Vegas. - You're right. Let's go. (people chattering) - Now, you live in this area the whole time? - [Man] Oh, yeah, lived here and Omaha. - Yeah, that's great. - [Man] Yeah. - Hey, we got a Captain Bruce Christian out here?! - [Bruce] Yeah, that's me. - You got a telephone call inside. - Looks like you've been busted. - On my day off? (Bruce sighs) (gentle synthesizer music) Did you fly in directly from Las Vegas? - I got in less than an hour ago. - Lucas, I'd like you to meet Colonel Richard Esteban, Rico. - Pleased to meet you, Colonel. I'm undercover, Secret Service, State Department. I requested you for this project. - Is this a military operation? - No. Both you and Captain Christian are less than a year away from early retirement. My department has the power to authorize that retirement effective immediately. This assignment comes with hazardous duty pay. To begin, you and Captain Christian will fly to Las Vegas. - Don't I have anything to say about this? - Say yes. (chuckles) - Yes. - Check the glove box. - [Nicole] We're set. (gentle synthesizer music) - [Announcer] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the 14th annual QSAA Fly-In here at El Dorado Dry Lake, Nevada. We're gonna have some giant-scale planes flying. QSAA, meaning Quarter Scale Association of America, means that the airplanes have to be 1/4 the scale of a real aircraft, or larger, or have a minimum wingspan of 96 inches. These model aircraft are constructed of silk, balsa wood, dope, fiberglass. It's also a hobby for the whole family. We hope you enjoy the show today out here, and you're gonna see some of the biggest and prettiest planes from around the world. Right now, on the lake bed, we'd like to ask all pilots to please form in pilot formation and turn all transmitters in. (device beeping) - Ava, they've arrived in Vegas. They're within a five-mile range of here. - [Announcer] That all spectators please stay back. (lively synthesizer music) We ask that all pilots make sure you keep your airplanes on the ready line. (upbeat synthesizer music) Largest organizations in the United States for giant-scale airplanes. It's also a subdivision of the Academy of Model Aeronautics. On a roll and takeoff, the beautiful Spacewalker. This beautiful 1/3 scale aircraft is constructed of balsa wood and silk and dope structure. It's a kit that's available at your local hobby shops. One hobby shop that has it is called Tony & Addie Hobby Lobby in Burbank. The Spacewalker, this airplane's powered by a Sachs Dolmar engine, producing a wing-over right now, and is flying with four channels. Got one channel for ailerons for roll. (doors thudding) - Sorry, ladies. This area's restricted. - Give it a rest, Norm. - Well, I'll be damned. You made it. That's good work. (device beeping) - They're here. Let's get ready. - Come on over here. I have something for you. - You've been waiting a long time for this. - This baby's gonna even the score. I'm gonna blow their tits off. - That should make Kane very happy. - I want him to be impressed. - [Norm] This is a scale model of a UH-1B Huey helicopter. - Looks like your best work. - Well, thank you. These are the controls. Let me know how they work for you. Complete operating instructions are in this green carrying case. Now, there's a twin Cessna waiting for you at the Henderson Airport. - We'll check in with Lucas once we're airborne. - It will take me a few minutes to disassemble this and to box it. - Let's step outside and check out the airshow. - Okay. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] All press people, all press people out there, these people on the line one, please step back. There's a P-51 Mustang taking off right now. This Nosen P-51 Mustang is 1/3 scale, powered by a Sachs Dolmar 3.6 engine, weighing 14 pounds. Airplane is pulling up over into a roll, into the upright position. P-51 Mustang, Cadillac of skies. Pulling up into another vertical is a biplane. This biplane is the Extra biplane. You notice he hesitated there on the roll. He's straightened it out. He's pulling up the elevator. He's back to level flying. Coming by for a nice inverted pass, the Spacewalker. This is the 230 Extra flying by, the red and white airplane. All of a sudden, his engine quits. We've got a dead sticker here. Watch him land it. Nice three-point landing. We'd like to note, that on the ready line, that all airplanes please stay in correct order. All airplanes stay in correct order, and that some of you pilots move the plane in front of you. Each pilot's responsible for his own. (snaps fingers) - Go. - [Announcer] Remember, we're going under the flight safety rules, the AMA and the QSAA. For your safety, please stay behind the area and no smoking around the aircraft. - There they go. Let's get 'em. - You drive, I'll shoot. There they are. (upbeat synthesizer music) - We're pretty vulnerable out here. You think we should worry? - Hell yes! - [Donna] What? Oh, damn! (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (gun firing) - Go! (guns firing) - [Rico] There they are! (guns firing) (rocket screeching) (explosion booms) (guns firing) (rocket screeching) (explosion booms) (gun firing) (rocket screeching) (Ava screams) (explosions booming) (fire crackling) - Who do you suppose helped us? - Chalk one up for the good guys. - Yeah! Nice shot, Rico. (sirens wailing) - There is no way we're gonna explain this. (upbeat music) - Where the hell are they going? I got to fix this dune buggy. - Look. - [Nicole] I'm not taking any chances. - Hey, Nicole! Hang on, we're supposed to go with ya! - Allow me to introduce you two. Maybe you already met. (both chuckle) - I'm Donna Hamilton. Thank you. - Colonel Richard Esteban. I've heard about you. - It's a good line, soldier. Just might work. (gentle synthesizer music) (computer beeping) (computer beeps) (computer beeping) (explosion booms) (computer beeping) - Shiatsu has given these hands the power of life. My electronic toys are giving me the power to control money. I have entrusted the power of death to others. I hope it was not a mistake. (gentle music) - We need to contact Lucas on the satellite phone. - I'll make the call. (phone beeps) (phone rings) - Talk to me. - We're on our way to Louisiana. We should touch down at Ellerbe Airstrip by dawn. - Do you need an update? - [Lucas] I heard you all had some company in Las Vegas. - Good news travels fast. - [Lucas] Anything more to tell? - No, nothing you don't already know. - All right, we'll convene at Big Pines Lodge noon tomorrow. - Good, it's remote and safe. - What about transportation? - [Lucas] It'll be waiting for you when you get there. - What about our team? - I'm on it.

What do you say me and you go cut a rug. - No, you know I can't dance. Besides, we have a new assignment. - I'm ready. I'm ready. I was really getting tired of all you had to race in of this faceless crowd. - Edy, I'm serious. Our loves may be in danger. - Doesn't matter. I'm a trained professional. Anyways, I can handle it. - Come on. We got to go, right now. - I'm out the door. - Are you with me? (gasps) - Yes. (romantic music) (both moaning) (upbeat music) - Be ready in a minute. - [Edy] Honey, what were you saying? - That we have a new assignment. - Then wipe that smirk off your face and get in the shower. You know, it's really a wonder I ever get anything done around here. - Kane's assassins have been uncanny in tracking us. We've got a pretty good view from here, but don't let your guard down. - [Rico] We copy, Nicole. We're with you all the way. (device beeping) - They're almost here, man. Got to get ready. - Raz, we can't afford to screw this up. - Hey, Ernie, don't sweat it, man. This plan is gonna work if you don't get carried away. - You know, when this is over, we'll be on a whole new plateau. - Yeah, something like this will go over real big in the Apple. - Oh, we'll be considered artists. - Wouldn't that be nice? - Mm. I'm going to make the best damn catfish in the world, man. - That's good, Ernie. Just remember to say y'all at the end of a sentence. You're supposed to be Cajun, Hebert. - Right, Bodreaux. (both chuckle) I'm going to make the best damn catfish in New Orleans, y'all. - It's New Orleans, Hebert. Mm, better put some more almonds in there, man. Didn't quite cover the taste. - Mm, right. And we call this the catfish amandine, so's they won't know about our secret ingredient, man. - Uh-uh. - Y'all. (upbeat music) (door bells jingle) (door bells jingle) - Hey, Bobby Ray. - Hey, Bruce. - I'd like you to meet a couple of friends of mine. Nicole, Donna, Rico. - [Rico] Hi. - Y'all want something to eat? I got some fine catfish. - I'm starving. - By the way, does Molly still cook for you? - No, she got a call this morning, her sister done took sick, but I got two boys from New Orleans. Bodreaux, Hebert, y'all come in here, you hear? - I hope y'all got the hungries 'cause we whipped you up something real good, guaranteed. - Since y'all are Bobby Ray's special guests, Hebert here cooked up an old family recipe. - Catfish amandine. Mm! - Um, I think I'd prefer the catfish lemon myself. - Mm, now that sounds good. - Catfish lemon all around. - Catfish lemon? Y'all can get a catfish lemon in any cheap joint in New Orleans. Y'all can't find my recipe in no cookbook, uh-uh. - What the man is trying to say, y'all, is you got an old-fashioned recipe they'd trade for when his ancestors settled into Cajun country. Ain't that right, Hebert? - Yeah. (chuckles) - What the heck, when in Rome. - The catfish amandine will do fine. Could you bring out some extra lemons? - Excuse us, y'all, why we go fire up this baby for y'all. - But onion go better than the lemon. - See you. - Enjoy your food, folks. - Lucas and Edy are driving here from Dallas. - Shane will be arriving by boat. He's been filling in the new operative, Atlanta Lee. It's her first job with the agency. - There, mm-hm. - Mm, here comes the food. - Thanks. - Hey, that looks good. - Mm-hm, sure does. - Catfish amandine. Thank you. - Here you go, y'all. (cat mews) - Oh, look at the Kitty. Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty. Are you hungry? So cute. Good boy. Here's some more. There you go. - I want you at your best. - What you're saying is you never get a second chance to make a first impression. - [Rico] Bonnie, can I have some lemons, please? - I wonder what's taking the rest of them so long to get here. (cat mews) (dramatic synthesizer music) Don't touch your food! The cat's dead. - The guys in the kitchen. Come on, let's go! Back this way! Watch out for 'em! (upbeat country music) - We quit. - Y'all! (door bells jingle) - Y'all fired. (door bells jingle) - Lucas, you see two guys come outta here? - Grab that! - Hold that! (gun fires) - Looks a little low! (gun fires) - [Nicole] Cover you from the plane! - Over there. - [Bodreaux] I think we lost them. - We got to get outta here, fast! - [Bodreaux] Yeah, let's go in here, come on. - Lucas. See anything? - [Lucas] Nothing. - Think we lost them, guys. - [Shane] Where the hell can they be? - There's a boat! - [Hebert] Let's take it, come on. - [Bodreaux] Hey, you know how to work this thing? - [Hebert] No, but it beats swimming. - [Bodreaux] Let's get in. - Look it, there they are! Oh, they're getting in the boat! - I see 'em! I think we can get them from here. - Hold on. - There's a plane! - Just act natural, like we're fishing or something. - [Both] We got no fishing poles! (guns firing) Grenade! (both scream) (explosion booms) (both cheer) (explosion booms) - Over there, let's go. (both groan) Freeze! Drop 'em. - Y'all boys aren't doing too well, are ya? Gotten six to you, and you've killed a cat. (Bodreaux groans) - [Hebert] Ow. - All right! (whistling) Yeah! (group cheers) Good work. Good job. - My friend here is gonna drive you to Dallas and put you on ice for a few years, so just sit back and enjoy the scenery. - Terrific. - Should've used lemons. Cats hate lemon. - Lemon, y'all. (siren wailing) (upbeat country music) - Well, that takes care of team number three. - Three more to go. (gentle synthesizer music) - [Silk] Tonight's meeting was really a success. - Of course. All my meetings are a success. We must keep in mind that our business here in Hawaii is the first step towards manipulating the American stock market. It's very simple, really. It has to do with a game I call risk tolerance. - Risk tolerance? - Mm. For instance, in the game of commerce, the risk tolerance is money. In the game of death, the risk tolerance is human life. In the game of romance, the risk tolerance is you. (computer beeping) (computer beeps) (computer beeping) (explosion booms) Come. I could use some shiatsu. (gentle music) - Kane is sly. The only information we got out of the two that we nailed today was that they didn't receive their orders until late last night. - In the same time frame as we did. - It could be that Kane has operatives inside the agency. - Could be. We'll cut off all contact with Washington till further notice. - But if we can't trust the agency, who can we trust? - Each other. - [Lucas] Maybe not even that. - I'm afraid Lucas has a point. - Where does that leave us? - Well, this area's way too hot. Edy, the house on Cross Lake? - Does anyone outside of this group know this place? - [Lucas] No, no one. - Good. - We need to cover Donna and Nicole. Can you get us some rifles with night scopes? - [Lucas] Yes. - How's the security at Cross Lake? - Tight as a drum. Edy and I spent some time there. Hell, the walls are even soundproofed. (chuckles) - That's good to know. - Good luck, Corporal. - That's Colonel. - Not when I get through with you. (coughs softly) - Better get some sleep. Bobby Ray has a speedboat. We'll leave before dawn. We'll be harder to trail in the dark. - Want you to see what Norm G had for us. - That's nice. I got something for you. - I'm on duty, Colonel. (sighs softly) - Can this be the end of Little Rico? (upbeat music) (Kane moans) - How are you felling now? - [Kane] Mm. - It says here there are 200 bones in the human body. (Kane groans) Make that 201. - Not for long. (Kane moaning) - This is it, gang. Look around you. We can't trust anybody but each other. (ominous synthesizer music) - [Lucas] This is the Cross Lake house, folks. Let's set up watch. Bruce, you're up first. - [Bruce] Fine. - [Lucas] All right, I'll relieve you in four hours. Rico, will you take over at dawn? - [Rico] You bet. (door thuds) (Bruce gasps) (upbeat music) - What? No glasses? - No frills. - I thought you're supposed to pour the salt on my hand. - You were wrong. (Nicole moaning) - All quiet so far, Colonel. - All right, get inside, get some sleep. I'll take over. - [Nicole] Mm, feels good. - [Atlanta] Yeah. (motorcycles whirring) (ominous synthesizer music) (device beeping) - That's them. I'll take out the blonde, first. - Hey, Donna, how about a cigarette, please. - [Donna] Sure. - Bye-bye, baby. (gun fires) (women scream) - Damn it, you missed! Let's get the hell outta here. (gun firing) - [Rico] Get inside, get Lucas! Later. - What the hell are you doing?! I am a United States federal agent. I have 30 confirmed kills and four presidential commendations. You cannot treat me like one of your bimbos. - I knew that. - You knew that. Right. - Let's go! - Split up! (loud crash) (loud crash) (screams) (gun fires) (gun fires) (groans) (gun fires) - [Rico] Mm-hm. (gun fires) - I don't believe it, he's putting up baseballs against my shotgun? What's wrong, jerk-off?! You outta bullets?! (explosion booms) - What happened? - Bastard hit my best pitch. I should've thrown him a slider. (laughs) (both moaning) (gentle synthesizer music) (intercom beeping) (Silk chuckles) - I'll get it. (intercom beeps) Yes? - [Man] Your tea is ready. - Tea time. (Kane groans) (door buzzes) (computer beeping) (explosion booms) - Perhaps now is the right time for us to reintroduce ourselves to our opponents? (sighs softly) - Not yet. Silk, tea at bedroom. - [Silk] He does his best thinking there. - I understand. (phone beeps) It's all set, Colonel. Rifles with night scopes are ready for pickup. Spot is four miles east of Fisherman's Dock. It'll take two hours each way. We'll maintain radio contact. - It's too late for you to return in daylight today. Sun rises at 6:15 a.m. Can you be back by 8:15 tomorrow morning? - Piece of cake. - Good. Synchronize your watches. - Uh, what watch? - Here, take mine. They'll be okay. Nicole and I are the targets. (mysterious synthesizer music) - Follow me, the guns have been placed just up ahead. These are beauties. - We'll stand guard from above. We'll meet back at the boat at dawn. (both gasp) (Atlanta sighs) (Atlanta moaning) (device beeping) - Let's go. (triumphant music) (upbeat music) (guns firing) - [Atlanta] Oh, my god, they're shooting at us! (guns firing) - Keep it steady, Lucas! (guns firing) Can I have some help, Please?! - What do you want me to do?! Park it so you can shoot straight?! - It's a lot to ask, but that would help! (guns firing) - If you were like this in bed, half the girls in Texas would still be virgins! (gun fires) (duck quacks) Shane, you shot a duck! - The sight on this sucker must be a little high. (guns firing) - Lucas, we better take over! - All you had to do was ask. (guns firing) (gun fires) (man groans) (gun fires) (man yelps) - Yeah! (computer beeping) (explosion booms) - Now, Lew and Chen. - [Silk] Right. (screams) (grunting) (grunting) (screams) (grunting) (grunting) (punches thud) (grunting) - [Rico] Looks like you hit rough waters. - Worse than that. - Say bye-bye to Mr. Kane's attempt number five. - We're almost home free. - You said the key word: almost. - [Donna] How did that son of a bitch Kane know you were going to pick up the guns? - We got to get outta here. This location's just getting too hot. - Yeah, our best bet is my place in Dallas. They may know where I am, but that doesn't mean they can get in. - Then let's go. (upbeat synthesizer music) We get hazardous duty pay for this. I hope we live long enough to spend it. - Well, what do you think? - Works for me. - Our lives are in danger and he's playing Marlon Brando from The Wild One. - You got to love him. - [Rico] All right, folks, let's come on out. - It's uncanny, Kane knows every move we make. - And either he has the damnedest intelligence in the world, or one of us is a mole. - Perhaps Atlanta should be isolated for now. - Who the hell are you to point a finger at me? If anybody here has a problem with my credentials, I'll take a transfer, but I'm not about to sit In a corner like a good little girl while you try to figure out what color hat I should wear. - Well, I- - Hold it! I personally selected Atlanta and Rico to join us here, and I stand behind that choice. Let's have a little dinner and talk this out. (microwave beeping) (microwave whirring) (electricity crackling) - Ow! That watch just burned me. (electricity crackling) - Hey, look at this. The microwaves from the oven are causing the watch to heat up. (microwave beeps) - That's my watch. I loaned it to Edy. - Be careful, it's hot. - That's how Kane's been tracking us, by satellite from the location of this laser microchip. - That explains the attempt against us on the speedboat. The computer couldn't tell us apart. (phone ringing) - Nobody else has input access to this satellite channel (sighs) until now. (phone beeping) This better be good. - Oh, it will be. The ladies are extraordinary, even surpassed my own expectations. Tomorrow, final day of challenge. I propose hand-to-hand combat, one-on-one. Your women face my men. - Face this. (phone beeps) (Lucas sighs) - I want them, Lucas. - Who's army are you in, Nicole? - That's not fair. - From where I stand, you're either in or you're in the way. - Hey, the game's not over yet. You can bet Team Six is on the way. It's time we play by our rules. - Gentlemen. You leave for the mainland in one hour. (ominous synthesizer music) (gentle synthesizer music) - Mind if I join you? - Think you can keep up with me? - Yes. - Satellite line to Kane is still open. (phone beeping) - Speak to me, you son of a bitch. (phone beeping) - River Road East. Go four miles, turn north. Go a quarter of a mile. They will find you. (phone beeps) - Norm G's device is ready and waiting. (mysterious synthesizer music) (Lew screams) (Chen screams) (Nicole yelps) (Donna grunts) (kick thuds) (Lew groans) (Nicole yelps) (kicks thudding) (Nicole groaning) (punch thuds) (Chen groans) (Lew grunting) (punch thuds) (Lew groans) (knee thuds) (Lew groans) (Chen grunting) (kick thuds) (Chen groans) (punch thuds) (kick thuds) - [Chen] That way. - Why are you doing this to me?! You don't even know who I am! - I don't know you? Who are you? - I'm Batman. (bat thuds) (Donna grunts) (Lew screams) (Lew groaning) I'm Batman. You got to love it. - [Donna] Let's go. (Lew groaning) - [Lew] Come on. Come on! Get up! Let's go! - This time, no more nice guy. (device beeping) - [Lew] They're out there somewhere. We'll find them. (device beeping) - [Nicole] We can't outfight them. Can't outsmart them. I'm scared, Donna. Whatever made us think we could win the game? Maybe they won't find us in here. (Donna whispering) (men screaming) Find us here. It's our last hope. Otherwise, we're dead. Shh, be quiet. I can see them. - What's going on here? (device beeping) Look, look. The watch! - [Donna] I wonder where they are. - [Nicole] We lost them? (model aircraft whirring) - [Lew] What's that noise?! Look! - [Chen] What the hell is going on? - [Lew] What is that?! - This was supposed to be hand-to-hand combat. - Here's my hand. (rocket whooshes) - Here's mine. (rocket whooshes) (men screaming) (explosions boom) (Rico laughs) - I got your hand-to-hand. (explosion booms) (Silk gasps) (computer chiming) (dynamite hissing) (explosion booms) (Kane groaning) - We start fresh tomorrow and try to nail Kane, right? - We know where he is now. - We traced him through a satellite phone transmission. - We have him linked to one of our electronic tracking devices. - And we persuaded Kane's companion, Silk, to cooperate with us. We've got a real lethal weapon working for us now. (gentle synthesizer music) (door buzzes) - [Silk] Relax, I have a surprise for you. Is this the microchip? - Yes. - I know what to do. (microchip buzzes) - I can't believe I lost the game. I'm so disgraced. - I have this crystal for you. It will protect your soul's light force, forever keeping you safe. And if that doesn't work, I have other things in mind for you. - What would I ever do without you? - You'll never be without me. (Kane chuckles) - Too bad we didn't locate Kane earlier. - Yeah, we could've saved ourselves a lot of grief. - Well, now that we do have him tagged, we go after him. - No, not quite. We have other plans. - Rico and I discussed this. We have Kane isolated. We'll know all his moves. We'll be able to trace him and his accomplices. - By keeping him active, we can disrupt his ass anywhere in the world at any time. - Works for me. I love the action. Invincible federal agent by day, irresistible country western singer by night. (group laughs) More or less. (group chuckles) - How do you feel about this, Shane? - I can't get over it. I shot a duck. (group chuckles) - Flying full speed. (group laughs) - I can verify that. It'll look good on your resume. - Word from Washington is that everyone's resume looks good after this operation. - I knew that. - You knew that? - I knew that. (group laughs) - Cheers. - Cheers. ♪ Down in the bayou, that's where we'll meet ♪ ♪ Under the plant of a hanging pea ♪ ♪ That's where I'll give you all of my sweet ♪ ♪ Love, down in the bayou ♪ ♪ Down in the bayou, that's where we'll go ♪ ♪ In the heat of the night with the moon all aglow ♪ ♪ That's where I'm planning to getting to know ♪ ♪ You, down in the bayou ♪ ♪ Creole man, keep you under a spell ♪ (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) ♪ My love for you, my darling, is too pure ♪ (singing in foreign language) ♪ I will come to you ♪ ♪ Down in the bayou, that's where we'll meet ♪ ♪ Under the plant of a hanging pea ♪ ♪ That's where I'll give you all my sweet ♪ ♪ Love, down in the bayou ♪ ♪ Down in the bayou, that's where we'll go ♪ ♪ In the heat of the night with the lights all aglow ♪ ♪ That's where I'm planning to getting to know ♪ ♪ You, down in the bayou ♪ ♪ Down in the bayou ♪ (audience cheers) (gun fires)
