(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic music) (alarm ringing) - [Guard] Section A. Section B. Section C. Get up! Get up! Up yours! Get up! Get up! - Woo, Zelda! - Zelda! - [Zelda] Shut up! - All right, Zelda, welcome back. - Hey, baby. - [Guard] I hope you stay out of solitary this time, Zelda. Wash up, you got two minutes. (inmates chattering) - Hey. - Sorry, I didn't see you there. - Get that broom away from me before I stick it down your throat. - Watch your fuckin' hands. (dramatic music) - Hi, Sarah. What are you reading, dear? - It's called a book. And it doesn't have any pictures in it, so you wouldn't be interested. - There's something I want to talk to you about. - I'm not interested. - Oh, I think you will be. Where is it? - Damn, you're always cheating. (inmates cheering) Tell me where. Hold her down, damn it. - Cut her, Z, cut her! - [Zelda] Tell me where is, Sarah, or I'll cut you like a turkey. I'm gonna make you my little girl, Sarah. Don't be afraid, Sarah, you may like it. - Move! Move! Shit. - Break it up! Break it up! Guards! That is enough! Stop it, that is enough! Break it up! Break it up, that's enough! That is enough, break it up! Where's Zelda? - I haven't seen her. - Shit. - All right, that's it. - Get her, Dot. Get her. My girls will take you out-- - Break it up! Break it up! - So fast. - Break it up, Zelda. All right, who started it? - She did it. Bitch started hitting on me for no reason. - I did not. - Shut up! - Get that crazy bitch away from me. - Shut up. Sarah, who started it? - I don't care, put 'em all in solitary. - Good idea. Let's go, move it! - You slut. - Come on, move it. Here. You, there. Get over there. Move it, Dot. Quit foolin' around and get in the cell there. - I hate you, Tina. - Oh shut up, Zelda. - [Zelda] Bitch. - Get in the cell, Peters. - Look, they were trying to kill Sarah. - Yeah, I've heard it before. Get in the cell. - They had a knife. - Look, Peters, I don't like troublemakers. - I'm not-- - Shut up and sit down! And if you're a real good girl, I might let you out in a week or two. - [Zelda] You're a bitch. - Sarah, you okay? What happened out there? - Nothing. (dramatic music) (knocking) - [Inmate] Cell 17. (knocking) - What? (knocking) Cell 17. - [Inmate] Shit. (knocking) - What? - [Inmate] Message for you. - Warden says you got yourself a new roommate. Peters, I don't know why, but the warden thinks you're something special. Well, I don't. And while you're on my cell block, you do exactly as I say, you got that? - Yeah. - Good luck. - You're welcome, by the way. - For what? - For saving your ass out there this afternoon. - Yeah, thanks. - They would've killed you, you know that. - They weren't going to kill me. - Oh yeah, what makes you so sure? - All they wanted was. Forget it. If it makes you feel any better, thanks. - Go to sleep. - [Guard] All right, let's go! Move it! - What are you so happy about? - I'm having a visitor today. - Yeah? - Yeah. Conjugal visit. I can't wait, it's been so long for me. So how 'bout you? - No conjugal visits for me. I'm not married. - Well, you get to have visitors at least, don't you? - No. - Come on. You mean to tell me that you don't have a boyfriend or anybody who comes and visits you? - Don't you know anything? My boyfriend Carlos, well, he'd rather-- (whistling) - [Wincott] All right, inspection. - Wincott's daily inspection. Just be cool. - Someone's been sneaking drugs into my cell block. Which one of you sluts has it been? Turn around, Peters. Hands against the wall. You know the routine. Come on, spread 'em. - Hey! - Leave her alone. - What did you say? - You're not searching for anything. Leave her alone. - Maybe you're right. If someone's been sneaking drugs in here, maybe it's you I should be interested in. Maybe you're the one I need to search. All right, Peters, I'm done with you. You, come with me. (dramatic music) You should know what I want. The same thing Zelda was after. - What are you talking about? - Are you playing games with me? You know what I'm looking for. - I don't know what you're looking for. - Then let this be a warning to you. Get out of here. Fuck! - Are you okay? - I thought I warned you, no more illegal searches. - Look, Tina, drugs are getting in here, but not on my shift. On yours. - That's bullshit! I am sick of you and your disgusting little searches. - Screw you, get out of my way. My arm, you're breaking my arm. - If I wanted to break it, you'd have heard it snap already. Now, lay off the prisoners, especially Sarah. You got that? - And if I don't? All right, all right, understood. Just let me go. - Are we clear now? - Everything's gotta be by the book with you, Lamb, doesn't it? - That's right. That way nobody gets hurt. - Follow me please. This your first conjugal visit? - [Jerry] Um, yes. - [Guard] Well, these are the rules. You and then prisoner you're visiting are confined to the room at all times. There are guards stationed outside, so don't try anything stupid. If you have an emergency of any kind, just call out. If you wish to leave, call out. If we hear anything suspicious, we will come in for inspection. If we hear any fighting, violence, or anything out of the ordinary, again, we will come in for inspection. Is this understood? - [Jerry] Yeah, yeah. - Your wife will be here in a minute. - Yeah. Hi. - Hi. - So what do you think, huh? Danielle. Damn it, what are you doing? - [Danielle] Take off your clothes. - What? - Take off your clothes. - Why? - Take off your clothes. Get under the covers. If they were lookin' in on us, you gotta make this look good for me. - Are you tellin' me they're gonna be watching us? - They might be watching us right now. Come on. Listen, Jerry, I been in this hell hole for two months. You know what that means? You're on my turf right now. So you wanna talk? Fine, we'll talk, but you know what? You damn sure better look like you're screwin' the hell out of me. Hurry up. - Just give me a minute. Hey, they were a Christmas gift, okay? (laughing) - I don't want to. - What's wrong? What'd I do? - What'd you do? It take you so long to come here to visit me. I mean, six months? You could come two months ago. (breathing heavily) (moaning) (laughing) - Hey, what about Sarah? - Well, I think I've got her under control at this point. - I can't believe we're doing this. - You know what? Wait a minute, let me get on top. In the covers. Okay, all right. - Listen, we don't have much time left on this deal. - I know, but I gotta win her trust completely. But believe me, I can get it. - She goes in two days. - Then pull some strings and send me with her. - Maybe. - [Tina] Come on. - Good morning. - Morning. All right, how was it? - What do you think? - I guess you married him for a reason. - Do you want to know a little secret? - Yeah, sure. - He's not really my husband. - Get out of here. The prison thinks that you're married? - Yeah. My husband is a forger. I mean, he does like credit cards, IDs, green cards, wedding certificates, you name it. Boy, we used to pull some scams together. I mean, just small-time stuff, but still. That's what landed me in here, so I don't know. Lucky bastard, he's still out there free though. I just hope he's not scammin' on me with another dame on the side or, well, anyway. So how about you? I mean you mentioned that you had a boyfriend the other day. What's up with you and him? - You don't know who I am, do you? - Just another little Kewpie doll in here I guess. - My boyfriend was Carlos Vega. He's a drug dealer, big time. (laughing) - You shacked up with a drug dealer? - What's so funny about that? - I don't know. I just expected you to be like living with your poetry teacher or something. (laughing) - I guess I'm not the typical drug dealer's whore. - No, that you're not. - Well, you know how it goes sometimes. When I was 16, I ran away from home. And like a lot of other girls, by the time I realized it was a mistake, I couldn't go back. And then I met Carlos at this party. I needed some money and a place to stay, and he offered me both. I knew how he made his money, but I took it. - So then what happened? - Well, I finally came to my senses, and I left. Believe me, it wasn't easy. - But then how did you end up in here? - I shot a man. He tried to rape me. I was hiding out from Carlos, and there was this man. I don't know who he was, but I think Carlos sent him. - So is Carlos trying to kill you? - Not exactly. I have something he wants back really bad. - Why don't you just give it back to him and maybe he'd leave you alone. - It's my insurance. Without it, he'd have already killed me. - I'm really beginning to wonder about you, Peters. You did it again. Looks like you're gonna have some company when we transfer you tomorrow, Sarah. - Danielle, you're coming with me? - Good behavior. I don't belong in this joint anyway. - I can tell it's gonna be a real cozy ride tomorrow. Get your stuff ready. We leave in the morning, early. - Geez, what is her problem? - What are you doin'? Where are you taking me? I'm being transferred tomorrow. It's already been approved. - Not quite. I'm not so sure that you're fit for a transfer at this time. - What are you talking about? You don't have the authority to keep me here. - The doctor does. You got something you wanna tell me maybe? You are a stubborn little bitch, aren't you? We'll just see what the doctor has to say. Doctor, this is the prisoner who needs evaluation for transfer. As I told you, she was in a fight the other day and was hurt and hasn't been well. She was beaten badly by another prisoner. She's unfit for transfer in my opinion. - Sarah Sands, is that right? Sarah, your past medical history looks good. But you understand, Sarah, we can't transfer you without being certain about your condition. It's something the state stipulates for its own protection. - I feel fine, Doctor. I wasn't injured in the fight, I'm fine. - All right, Sarah, go ahead, get undressed please. Turn around, Sarah, please. All right, Sarah, I don't see any bruises or any indication that she's been beaten severely like you said. - All right, get the hell out of here. (dramatic music) - Hold it. Okay, come on forward. Stay on the yellow line. Come on, Peters, don't hold it up. - Name and number. - Sarah Sands, 54776. - Name and number. Name and number! - Danielle Peters, 12513. - [Guard] Name and number. - Margaret Murphy, 02215. (laughing) - All right. - Hey, so what the hell is this thing that Carlos wants back from you so bad? Oh, come on. I mean, it's been buggin' me ever since you mentioned it yesterday. What the hell is it? - It's a little black book filled with numbers and codes, that's all. It's somethin' that could put an end to Carlos' underworld dealings. - Oh, so that's why he wants it back so bad. - That's why, as long as I have it somewhere, he won't dare kill me. Without it I'd be dead already. - What makes you so sure? - I'm still here aren't I? - Well, that's true. Well, why don't you just go to the police with it? - Are you crazy? They can't protect me from Carlos. - Well, I hope you got that thing well-hidden, girl. - I do, and I have a really good memory. (dramatic music) - Hey, Chauffeur, come on, aren't we there yet? - [Tina] Cool it, Maggie, you're on the second stop anyway. - Hey, hey, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Come on, I've been in a car accident. My friends are hurt, come on. - We're not police officers. - No, come on, please come on. We've been in a car accident. - Look, we're not-- - Hey, hang on, hang on. I'll check it out. Why don't you call in our position and better call an ambulance too. - All right, don't worry. Look, I don't wanna hear a peep out of any of you. This is Department of Corrections vehicle number 00941. - Hey, this one's got a pulse, she's alive. - Come in, come in. (gunshot banging) (screaming) (gunshot banging) - [Danielle] Get down. - Hey. (gunshot banging) (gunshots banging) - [Danielle] Oh my gosh, get down. - Rhodes, you all right? - Yeah. - Don't you dare get near that engine, bitch. I'll just waste all of ya in there, and I mean it. You wouldn't want that, would ya? Come on, lady, you're a sittin' duck here. Just give us Sarah, and we'll be all right. Come on, let's be friends. Let's talk about it, okay? Hey, you wasted my best gal. Now, I am willing to forgive and forget. - Right. - [Slash] Give us Sarah, and you can go on your merry way. - Hey, man, I ain't got nothin' to do with it, all right? She's right here. She's right here, and I will help you. (gunshot banging) (screaming) Oh man, I'm sorry about that. I just couldn't resist. I hate loudmouths. Hope we can still be friends, huh? Quit fuckin' around and give us Sarah, I mean it. - I can't do that. - Why can't you do it? Are you afraid you're gonna lose your job? You guys are late. - [Man] Sorry, Slash, we had some problems. - Listen, lady, I got party guests here, and you're in a whole heap of trouble. - Go. - I suggest-- (gunshots banging) (dramatic music) - Damn it. (gunshots banging) Come on, let's go get 'em. (gunshot banging) (tires screeching) That bitch hit my tire. Well, don't just stand there. Go get some help, you dick. - [Danielle] Come on, Jesus, won't this thing go any faster? - [Tina] I'm trying, I'm trying. Something's wrong. Shit. We're gonna have to go on foot, come on. - Come on, Sarah, let's go. Sarah? No! - She's dead. Come on, Peters. Come on, gotta leave her. - Let me out! - Come on. Quick, down here. (dramatic music) Hold it, gimme the gun. - What are you talking about? - I don't know who you are, Peters. I'm not taking any chances now. - Tina, I'm a federal agent. Special Agent Danielle Peters with the FBI. - Oh, FBI my ass. Gimme the gun, unless you want your little friends back there to catch up to us. - Here. (gunshot banging) (screaming) Jesus Christ! Why don't you just try using the key? - Because I don't have the key, it's back in the van. Now, start running, you out front. Move it. - God, this is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. - [Man] Hey, Slash, you better see this. - [Slash] What is it? - [Man] It's Sarah, she's dead. - Stupid bitch! Goddamn! - Halt. Turn around, slowly. Hold out your arms. Now, cuff yourself to my wrist. It's to make sure you don't try anything funny. - Tina, this is not necessary. - That was the key. So if you're thinking of going anywhere without me, don't. - Tina, I am not a convict. I am a federal agent working undercover, all right? - Right. - I was assigned to keep an eye on Sarah, to find out what she knows, and to protect her. - Well, it doesn't look like you did such a great job then, does it? - Well, doesn't look like you did either, did you? - You are my prisoner, Peters, so start walking. Move it. - Fine. - Hello, can anybody hear me? - Tina, we are in the middle of a deserted road. Do you really think anybody's gonna hear you? - Just stuff it, Peters. This way. - Hang on. Hang on, I got an itch. - Are you finished? - Yes, I'm finished. - I had to handcuff myself to the biggest mouth in the prison. - Hey, look, there's a telephone. Let me make a call. - Why would I let you do that? - I'll call the bureau. They'll send a car out, and it'll be the proof that you need, okay? - You just don't give up, do you Peters? - Tina, this is a federal investigation. And you know what? If you don't let me make a call, I'll see to it that you're sharing a cell with Zelda by tonight for interfering in a federal investigation! You got that? - Okay, one call, but I'm watching you, Peters. - Come on. - Slow down. - Speed up. Okay, now if I can just remember my calling card number. Damn. Do you have a quarter? - Do I look like a bank to you? - No. Fine. - What are you doing? - I'm getting some change. - You are not breaking into that phone booth while you are handcuffed to me, Peters. - Fine, you're right. What have I, God, I'm sorry. - I told you not to do that. - Change. (lively string music) - [Photographer] Hey. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I like that. Cool. - [Woman] Carlos, what do you think? - Turn around. Roberto (speaking in foreign language). Gimme some stills right way. That's beautiful, baby, beautiful. Exactly what I want. We'll have dinner tonight. - [Woman] Thank you, Carlos. - Goddamn it, be careful with that fabric. - [Woman] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Vega. - I apologize, I shouldn't yell at you like that. That fabric's for my show this weekend. Please be careful with it. - Carlos, it didn't happen. Slash is in the back. - Goddamn it. (speaking in foreign language) - Yeah, Carlos. - What the fuck is this? Did I tell you to use these colors, huh? Did I tell you to use these colors? - No, Mr. Vega, no. (speaking in foreign language) - Slash. I heard about the ambush. Very messy, Slash, very messy. - Oh man, Carlos, I did everything just the way you said. I went in there. It was so clean, man, I'm sorry. Sarah's dead. - Well then, I hope you found out where she hid the code book. - See that's the thing-- (sharp smacking) - The feds are closing in on me, and you come in here with that kinda fucking news? I'm very disappointed in you, Slash, very disappointed. - Oh, Carlos man, I did everything right. Everything just the way you said. It wasn't me, it was this girl. She came out of nowhere. She started shootin'. She ain't no regular prisoner, Carlos. She ain't no regular prisoner. Just gimme one more shot, man, I know I can get her. I know I can. - You know, Slash, I've always loved this country. My work. My women. But if this bitch turns out to be a fed, I'm gonna have to leave. - I'm sorry, man, just give me one more shot. I can do it. I'll make it real clean. - Wait for me outside, Slash. - Oh, come on, I'll just go in just a couple-- - Outside. - Yeah, man, it's cool. - (speaking in foreign language) phone. (phone ringing) - [Man] Hello? - Yeah, it's me. - [Man] Si, senor Vega. - I want you find out about a woman. Where she lives, who she lives with, everything. I don't care what it costs, what you gotta go, just do it. Do it now, right now, yesterday. - [Man] Si, senor. (speaking in foreign language) Si. - [Tina] Stupid flies. - Hey, there's the car. Come on, let's go. - Help me stand up. Thank you. - Ow! - [Agent] FBI, don't shoot. - All right, get out of the car. Slowly. Keep your hands where I can see 'em. Now, let me see some ID. - There, are you satisfied now? - Maybe. - Oh God, come on. - I'll go along with it for now. - Shut up and get in. Let's go. - Can we go get some ice cream? - No, Jessica, you know we can't because it's getting late and you're going to have dinner soon. And besides, your mom wouldn't like it. (screaming) - Mary! Mary! Mary! (knocking) - Come in. - Tina, this is my field supervisor Jerry Cooper. - Glad to meet you, Tina. - Nice to meet you. - Have a seat, both of you. Thanks John and Rich. Got some bad news, Danielle A few hours ago, someone kidnapped your daughter. There were two men. We don't know who they were, but we think they may have been hired by Carlos Vega. - But why? I mean. - If it was Vega, he probably thinks you found out where Sarah hid that code book, in which case he's probably using Jessica to try to negotiate his freedom. I'm really sorry Danielle. We're doing absolutely everything that we can. - What about Mary? I mean, is she okay? - Yeah, she's fine, she just got roughed up a little bit. - If that son of a bitch hurts Jessica, I'll kill-- - Listen, Dani, you can't be irresponsible right now. At present, we don't even know if it was Vega who took Jessica. Sit down, pull yourself together. Listen, you're okay. I've gotta ask you a couple questions. We've been busy since the time you called in. We recovered the prison van along with Sarah's body. We analyzed she's possessed that we know of, both in and outside the prison. Her clothes, her books, everything. And we came up empty. We've got no clue right now where she hid that damn code book. We're right back at square one. We've got nothing on Carlos Vega. So I've gotta ask you, is there anything you can tell us that can give us a lead on that damn code book? - She just told me that, in addition to hiding it, that she memorized it. - That doesn't do us any good right now, does it? - Excuse me. I mean, if you don't mind my asking, what is this code book? - Vega is, Vega's a drug dealer that we've been after, and Sarah was his girlfriend. And when she felt that her life was in danger, she stole the code book. It has all of his money laundering and his drug contacts in it. - So that's what you were after then. - Yeah. - Listen, why don't you go on home and try to get some rest? I'll keep you informed if anything develops. - Wait a minute, you're taking me off the case? - I'm sorry, Danielle, you know the rules. I can't have an agent be personally involved. - We're talking about my daughter here. She is kidnapped because of me, and you expect me to just go home and sit and wait while you keep me informed? I'm sorry, Jerry, I can't do that. - Listen, I'll have somebody drive you home. - I'll go-- - Don't bother. I've got my own car here. - Tina, you haven't been properly debriefed. I'm gonna have to trust you not to repeat anything you've heard here. Not a word, not to anyone. - That's what I like about the government, all those little secrets. God. I really love your car. How fast this thing go anyway? - It does okay. Just don't try pegging the needles. I just paid it off, all right? - Don't worry. - You sure you don't wanna come in for some coffee? - No, it's been a long day. I have a friend who lives close by. She'll let me crash there. - All right, just bring it back in the morning. - Okay, don't worry. You sure you're gonna be all right? - Nothing that a hot shower won't kill for the time being. - Good night. - I'm sorry, Jess. (crying) (dramatic music) - So at last we meet up close and personal, Miss Federal Agent. - What do you want? (laughing) - Such a silly question, but to the point I guess. Carlos wanted me to tell you, oh yeah, he's got your little girl. - Sit down! - Temper, temper, you don't wanna lose your head over this, now do ya? Leave your little girl an orphan? I don't think so. - If he hurts Jessica, he can bet I will personally see him dead. - Relax, your kid's gonna be okay for as long as you cooperate. - Well, if he's worried about his precious little code book, just tell him he needn't be. Sarah didn't tell me anything before you so stupidly killed her. - Yeah, we got a problem there because no matter what you tell us, how are we gonna believe you? So here's the deal. If you or your federal agents come anywhere near Carlos, you just might find that little kid of yours just kinda floatin' upside down in a swimmin' pool. So I would convince your friends just to lay off Carlos for a little while. Give him two weeks, and he can get out of the country. And when he feels good and safe, you'll get your kid back. - Yeah, and how can I be sure he'll do what he says, huh? - You got his word. See, we're holdin' all the cards. Carlos wanted me to make sure that you knew that the only reason that you and your little girl are alive is 'cause you're gonna cooperate with us. - Never! (sharp smacking) - You know, personally, I would love to see you dead. I would love to kill you. But Carlos, he kinda wants you and Freddie here to kinda get to know each other a little better. Fuck. - Not so fast. What do we do with the body? - [Danielle] I'll call a friend, he'll take care of it. - Oh God, I look terrible. Go ahead and sit. You got antiseptic in here? - Yeah, so how'd you learn to fight like that? - To protect myself from prisoners like you. - I'm really glad you came back. - Yeah, I didn't think you should be alone tonight. This might hurt a little. It's not too bad. - Tina, I'm going after Carlos Vega, and I need your help. - Uh uh, you heard your boss, you're off the case. - He's got my daughter, what am I supposed to do? The bureau is never gonna get Carlos. Hell, he'll be out of the country before they even figure out what they can pin him on. - Danielle, I'm just a prison guard. I'm not trained for this kinda stuff. - Well, what about Jessie, huh? I'm sorry, I really don't think that Carlos Vega is taking Jessica out for ice cream in the park. - The FBI's gonna handle it. - The FBI? They're all tied up in their procedures and rules. They're never gonna be able to act fast enough. - Look, Danielle, come on, I'd rally like to help you, but I mean just the two of us? It's crazy. First, okay, we'd have to break every law in the book to get to Carlos. And second, minor detail here, we'll get killed. And if we don't get killed, we'll get locked up at the very least. - Look, Carlos Vega is a cold-blooded killer, a ruthless convict, and the man has to be stopped. Hello? Hasn't what has happened in the last 24 hours convinced you of that? Tina, I gotta get Jessie back. - Can I at least have a shower first? - Okay, this will just take a second. I gotta bypass this logon and password so they won't find out I'm in the file. - I don't know. I'm not so sure we should be doing this. - Tina, just trust me. - Well, hurry up. - [Danielle] There I'm in. - That's Carlos Vega? - Mhm. - Why's he look familiar? - You know, Carlos Vega, the fashion designer. - You're kidding me, you mean the Vega? God, he does some great stuff. Wish I could afford it. - Yeah, me too. He used this business as a front. As far as we can tell, the business is totally legit, which makes it a great cover for all his drug dealings. - No, wait, wait. Looks like Jerry's investigation has narrowed it down to two locations that they think Carlos is holding Jessie. One's his mansion, and the other is this warehouse he's got under an assumed name. - Hm, his mansion's like a fortress. Heaven knows he'd be guarding it more heavily now. - [Tina] Yeah. - What about this warehouse though? You think Jessie might be in there? - Could be. - Well, that's the warehouse. We should probably go in on foot from here. - Looks quiet. - Yeah, it does. Get down. All right, now you know what to do, right? - Yeah. - You okay? - I'm fine, let's just do it. - Excuse me. Look, this is gonna be real easy. All we're gonna do is go in and take a look around. I'll take the lead, but I'm countin' on you to cover me if the shit starts flying. - Oh, that's comforting. - Come on. - I doubt if he'd just leave the door open for us, do you think? I mean, if he was trying to hide something. - Maybe that's exactly what he wants us to think though. Come on, let's go. - I'm sorry. All right. - Geez. - It's almost too quiet. - I know. Come on, let's go. All right, you stay here. I'm gonna go inside and check it out. - Be careful. - Psst. Shh. - Don't do that. - I'm sorry. - God. - Nobody's in here. Just some guy and a girl gettin' it on. - I think we should leave and give them some privacy. - I can't believe there's nothing. - I guess that means we're breaking and entering his mansion next? - You bet your sweet ass. - Drop your guns, put your hands in the air! Come on, do it now. - Look, maybe we can work something out, huh? I'm serious, you guys. Look, we do something for you, you do something for us. - You know what, Tina? I'm sorry, look at these guys. They don't look like the kinda guys that that's gonna work with. - Danielle, would you just? I'm trying to work something out here. (dramatic rock music) - Hold it right there, nobody move! This time you're over the line. You almost killed two of my men. - Well, they should've identified themselves. - Don't you open your mouth, I'm not finished. You completely ignored the fact that I've taken you off this case. Not to mention Tina, who you've now got investigating in a top-level federal investigation with no security clearance of any kind. Did you even think of the danger you're putting her in? - Hey, it was my choice. I was acting on my own. - Oh, were you? Well, you're not an agent. You don't act on your own in a federal case. - Well, I do. When it comes to my daughter's life, not you, or the bureau, or anybody else is gonna stand in the way of that. - Really, were you thinking of your daughter's safety or you just thinking about your own guilt? Don't fuck up this case just because you feel guilty about putting Jessica in danger. It's not your fault. Now, sit down. Despite what you think, we have been doing all we can. We've been surveying Carlos' mansion and the warehouse. You could've really screwed things up at the warehouse, but I don't think his men saw what happened. Now, I can't help but think that you have some information you're withholding from me. Has Carlos contacted you? Has he threatened to hurt Jessica? - No. - If you have any proof that he's holding her, I can get a search warrant in two hours. - Oh, come on, jerry. You know as well as I do that Carlos Vega would know about a search warrant before the ink even had a chance to dry. - You have any better ideas? Listen, Danielle, I've been after Carlos Vega for a long time. I want him bad. Now, with Jessica being kidnapped. But I can't just bust in there. We have to do this right or we're never gonna hold him. - I know, Jerry. - Do you have any proof that he's got her? - No. - I have no choice but to suspend you. - No! - What? - And Tina this is not your business. I suggest you go home. - Hey, do you mind? - Oh no, go ahead. - I'm starving. Is your boss always such a fun guy? - You know, as much as I hate to admit it, he was right about one thing. I was totally out of line asking for your help on this. - Oh, don't be ridiculous, Danielle. - No, I'm serious, I had no right to get you involved. - Will you give me a little credit? It was my decision. - Thanks. - You're welcome. You are still going after him, aren't you? - I don't think I have much choice, now do I? - Uh uh, so count me in. - No, I cannot ask you for your help on this. It'll be too dangerous. - Well, you're not asking me, are you? I'm telling you, you need me. - And I'm telling you no, it'll be too dangerous. - Will you give me a little credit? I'm a prison guard, I can handle myself. Besides, I think I sort of have a knack for this job, don't you? - All right, partner. - Partner. (funky electronic music) - Excuse me, Jennifer, you have a phone call. - Thank you. Hello? - Jennifer? Hi, Danielle Peters. - Oh, Danielle, hi. - Listen, I'm in a bit of a bind. I kinda need to see you. - Yeah, yeah, I'll be there. - All right, I'll see you then. - Okay, bye bye. Thank you. - You're welcome. (doorbell ringing) - Hi, Jennifer, come on in. Tina, may I introduce to you Jennifer Springer, probably one of the most sought after Paris models. - I know. Hi, I'm Tina Lamb. - Hi, Tina. - God, you're even prettier in person. I hate you. - Stop. - You know, I'm really sorry to have to drag you in to all this, Jen. - No problem, trust me. I want to do all I can to help you Danielle. - Jennifer's not only a high fashion model, but she also works for several European secret service agencies on occasion. - [Tina] Really? - And I guess it was, what, a couple of years ago we worked together on a case? - Right, yeah. - And, at one point, it got pretty hairy and-- - And basically she saved my ass. - Geez. - I don't know that it was nearly as exciting or half as heroic as she makes it out to be. - Hey, it was a close call. So here I am. Let's get down to business. What's the plan, boss? - Well, I'm positive that Carlos has got Jessie somewhere in his mansion. And he's got a fashion show coming up on Sunday. That's in two days, so we don't have much time. My guess is, as soon as that fashion show's over, he's gonna try and leave the country and take Jess wit him. - Right, so we have to do something before then. We're planning tomorrow night. - Oh, his mansion's a really weird place. I mean, for his safety, he's built his own fashion business including his garment factory in his back yard. - Security's really tight around there, though, but he's real quirky about it in that he relies more on armed guards and less on electronic surveillance. - We may be able to use that to our advantage then. - Bingo. - I do know a little bit about his habits. I know that he always prepares for his shows at his mansion. That means the models always go there first for the rehearsals and preparations. Then he wraps up and ships out to the show. - Exactly. So Saturday night the place should be teeming with models, and that's our opportunity to get in. - [Jennifer] Right. - And that's where we need you, Jen. - Wait a second, what about the FBI? Good old Jer is probably gonna have his men covering the mansion, won't he? - Well, we'll just have to hope that we find Jessica before they find us. - Right. - Let's give it a shot. (dramatic music) - Good evening, ladies. - Hi, guys, how's it goin'? - Fine, thank you. Listen, we had a little bit of a problem with a bomb scare earlier, so we're having to check everybody in. I know it's a hassle, but I hope you don't mind. - Well, we're very late already, so I hope it doesn't take long. - No, it should just take a minute. - [Guard] Would you ladies step out of the car please? - Oh, yeah. - Put your hands on the car. I'm sorry about this, really. All right, I'll need your names. - Jennifer Springer. - Oh yeah, I've seen your work. - Oh, have you? - Yeah. - That's great. (clearing throat) Oh, this is Laurie, she does my hair and makeup. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, it's just makeup and stuff, it's okay. - It seems we have a problem here. Your names aren't on the list. - [Jennifer] You've got to be kidding me. - No. - I cannot believe this. My agent just called me a few hours ago and told me to drop everything. I got here as soon as I could, and now this? - Jen, do you mean to tell me that we came all the way over here for nothing? - Look, I can call in, we can clear this up. - Look, I'm sure they just didn't get a chance to put my name on the list yet. I mean, can't you just let us through? You know who I am. - No. Are you girls trying to keep me from calling this in? - No, we're late for rehearsal already, all right? You know how Carlos is about this. (dramatic music) - [Danielle] Way to go, Rambo. - Hey, you guys were in trouble. I had to do something. - [Danielle] Well, I know, but what about the plan? You think they're not gonna realize these two guys are missing? - Yeah, and the feds would spot what's happened if they haven't already. Do we abort? - No, we're not gonna get another chance. Think, Dani. Jennifer, you go in with me. Go around back. - Okay. - Hey, you could say thank you. - Thanks. (funky electronic music) Jennifer. - Yeah? - Talk about money. God, this place is huge. - Yeah, I know, I told you. - Tina's gonna go check out the warehouse. We should see him at the garment factory. - Oh, all right. - Come on. You go first. - Okay. - This place is really huge. We got a lot of ground to cover, kiddo. - Yeah. You think Jessica's over there? - I don't know, we'll check it out. - Yeah, right. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. - So now what do we do? - I think I'm gonna go take a look around, okay? - Okay. - [Woman] This is the dress and shoes that you'll be wearing this evening, if you'd like to go and slip those on. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Nothin'. - So now what do we do? - I don't know, I guess we just keep lookin'. - So (laughing) we meet again, pretty lady. - Mr. Vega, I redid the turquoise low-cut evening gown. - That's fine, fine, terrific. - Sign this please. - That dress, it's just beautiful. Beautiful on you. - Well, of course, Carlos. It's one of your creations. - Have we met? You look awfully familiar. - Yes, we were introduced a couple of years ago at another show. I'm Jennifer Springer. - Ah, Jennifer Springer, of course. I know the name. Glad to have you. Now that we've been introduced, who might this be? - This is my personal makeup and hair stylist, Laurie. - Well, don't let me keep you then. - Yes, Carlos. - Excuse me, ladies. I was just wondering if I might ask your opinion on something. Well, actually it's more of a question rather than an opinion. You see, I was just wondering whether or not you've had any luck finding your kid. - You sorry son of a bitch. - I'm waiting for an answer. - Where is she? I can walk by myself. So what'd you do with Tina? (speaking in foreign language) Tina. - Ah, your pesky little friend. Not to worry, we're gonna visit with her right now. - [Woman] They need you upstairs to approve the dresses. - I don't give a fuck about no damn dresses right now. Can't you see the feds are closin' in on me? You just get Roberto Carangelo on the phone. Tell him to transfer my money to the Swiss accounts, and tell him I said every last cent or I'll have Rosario blow his head off. Go ahead. - [Woman] Yes, Carlos. - Ladies, your friend is waiting. - Oh, it's party time. Sit, bitch. - Did you ladies actually think you could come into my house, La Casa de Carlos Vega, and fuck with me? Now, I thought we had an understanding, you and me. You know, I'm okay, your kid's okay. So with that in mind, tell me, why did the feds send you in here? I mean, what is it they're up to? - They're not up to anything. We came in here on our own. Look, I want my daughter back. You just give me my daughter and let my friends go, you can do whatever you want with me. - And then what? The feds are gonna let me just waltz out of here? Is that what you're telling me? - Sarah never told me anything about your stupid little code book. The feds don't have anything on you. - Oh, so then I should let you all go. Well, I don't think that's such a good idea. Slash, what do you think? - I don't know. Little Miss Federal Agent hasn't been too nice to me. I wouldn't trust her. - Si, si. Doradio, go play. - Hey! - Take your hands off me! - [Slash] Sit down, sit. - Just let her go! - Sit. - Look, why are you doing this, huh? What do you want from us? - Why don't you just tell us what the feds are up to outside, okay? - We came in here on our own. They've taken me off the case. - Yeah, well, why don't you tell us what you do know? I mean, just think of what you're doin' to that poor friend of yours, not to mention what you're doin' to that poor little daughter of yours. - Jesus Christ, I don't know anything. - Just listen to her, she's telling you the truth. - They don't have your code book, and I don't know what they're planning, all right? - Okay, ladies, let's cut the fuckin' bullshit. Slash? - Yeah. - Let's take them for a little walk. - Come on, Princess. Come on. Come on, smile at all the party guests outside. Smile real pretty at all the party guests, my lovely little ladies. Smile, come on, smile. Look at all them, they're models, hun. You could be pretty too, but you ain't gonna be. Not after I'm done with ya. Hey, you haven't seen my knife tricks, have you? Too bad, babe, it's my specialty. - Really? I thought your specialty was being Carlos' pet bulldog. - Bitch. (gunshots banging) (screaming) - Get out of here. - Get down, get down. (gunshots banging) - [Agent] This is the FBI, put down your weapons. I repeat, this is the FBI. You are surrounded. (gunshots banging) - Come on, bitch, come on. Come on, you think you got it? You come to me, bitch. (shouting) (coughing) - Hows about this? Take 'em off right now. (coughing) - FBI! - FBI! - Drop your weapons! Drop em! - Nice. - Freeze, you ugly fuck! Drop your piece. Drop it! - Bring me a casualty report right away. - Let her go. Let her go. Let her go. - Mommy, Mommy. - Congratulations, Miss FBI, you made it to the bonus round. Now, how do they say it? I could kill her now or I could kill her later. You decide. Ow! - Come on, Jess. You know what? You picked the wrong kid to kidnap. - Dani! He's not worth it. Come on. - [Jerry] Back off, Dani. - Come on. - Get this dirt out of here. Don't leave until I say so. (crying) - You're okay. - Jessie. - Jessie, are you okay? Jennifer. Jennifer. - [Jennifer] Is everybody all right? - [Tina] Jennifer. - Oh Jen. Oh Jerry, thanks for comin' in after us. - You didn't leave me much choice, did you, after the way y'all busted in to this place. Hey, I'm just glad Jessica's okay. - I'm just sorry you didn't get Carlos. - I don't think we're gonna have any problem holding him. - The code book? - That's it. - Oh my God. - But, I mean, how did you get it? - Sarah. You know, she had a tattoo of a small, black rose on her thigh. At first, I didn't think anything about it because most inmates have tattoos of some kind. But it kept bugging, so I did some rechecking. Turns out she has an aunt, lives in Texas. She's the only member of her family that Sarah stayed in touch with after she ran away from home. This aunt began growing black roses some years ago. She's actually quite well known for 'em. There's no such thing as a true black rose, so anything that even comes close is considered very rare. And this aunt sent Sarah black roses on her birthday, telling her how rare she was. And we found out that's where she'd sent the code book in case anything happened to her. - Well, she was definitely a rare breed. - Looks like she told you what you wanted to know after all. - Yeah. - I also did some checking on you, Tina. - What? - Had to make sure you weren't a plant by Vega. - Jerry. - Oh, give me a break. - Well, I found out that you've applied to the bureau a couple of times. - You know about that? - Yeah, you may not know this, but I can make sure appointments go through for specially qualified applicants. - I told you I had a knack for this stuff. (laughing) - Yeah, and I need all the help I can get keeping an eye on a particular agent. - I know what you mean. - Hey! - Danielle, do you have any idea the kind of trouble an agent that was on, say, suspension would be in if they were involved in the kind of activity goin' on here tonight? Fortunately, your suspension's going to begin after you come back to the office and do all the paperwork on this case. I think two weeks with Jessica should be about enough. - Come on, Jess. Oh, Jerry, can it be three? - God, don't push it. Don't push it, Peters. Come on, let's get out of here. - I was wrong, you are a fun guy. - [Jerry] Oh, shut up. - [Danielle] Come on, sweetie. - [Jerry] Let's let the lab guys have this place.
