♪ In weather, record-breaking hurricane-force winds are hitting us early in the season this year. We're looking at sustained gusts of over 97 miles an hour. It's a real challenge here, without power. Standby for a list of evacuation zones. This storm's coming in fast. ♪ Come on Dancer. Let's go! Come on! We should head over to Paige's! She's got a basement. Dancer? Dancer! Dancer! Dancer! Dancer! Dancer! Dancer! Lord, I need a little help right now. I got him! Come on. What are you doing here? The old oak tree fell across the road. I can't get out. Thank you for saving my dog. Hey! Where're you going? You can't get out. The roads are all closed. My car got stuck. I'm going to wait it out in my barn. Good. Good. Let's go. I'm coming too. It seems you waited a little too long to evacuate, Lauren. Seeing as you only made it this far, it looks like you waited a little long yourself, Collin. Power and cell service is out all throughout the valley. This may be the Storm of the Century. Reports of tornadoes touching down. The worst is still heading our way. If you can hear this, take shelter immediately. The time for evacuation is over. Looks like we'll be here all night. Um, my dad has some work clothes you can throw on. There's some pants and shirts... No, you let me stay in your barn, and I'm not going to take your dry clothes too. No, no, don't worry. I have my own work clothes here, actually. Good. I'm sure you look good in anything. I'm going to... Back here? Of all the guys in town. Collin Traub. Collin, Lauren, team two. All right. Okay, you put your arm around me. -Okay. -And I put mine here. Then we put this leg forward, and then that one, then repeat. Everybody ready? Ready! Set! Go! Inside! Outside! No, outside! Inside! Outside! We're gonna win! We're gonna win! Sorry! I spoke too soon! I thought we were going to win. Fine. We were outdone! No problem. But, how about you be my partner for the wheelbarrow race? Deal. Deal. Let's get this off. Let's go. Thank you. Ciro, is it me or are they... No, there's a vibe. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. ♪ Lemonade. I believe you like lemonade. How'd you know that? Birthday parties, when we were kids. Right, right. I remember. But it was lemonade and chocolate cake. -Right. -Remember? Because together that would be weird but apart it's perfect. Perfection. For me, personally, I like milk and cake. I know it's weird. Today's been really fun. Yeah. I really enjoyed losing that race. Okay, I'm just going to go out on a limb here, but I think this would be really fun to do again next week. The fair's not going to be back until the end of the month. I know. Not the fair. No, I just meant coffee, or a movie, or something. I'll get the tickets, you get the popcorn. I don't think so. Lauren, I'm sorry. Lauren. No, I get it. -I'm doing you a favor. -I get it. Honestly, Lauren. ♪ I think it's about time for you and me to hit the hay. Seriously? Yeah. This is for you. And I'll be over here. No, no. You're the guest. You can sleep in the bed. No, no, that's not going to happen. This is your barn. You were kind enough to take me in out of the storm, so you know I didn't give you much of a choice. And apparently you don't like me very much, I don't think. Well you know what Collin? You made that bed. What are you talking about? Collin, you remember exactly what I'm talking about. What I remember, I remember being here to one of your birthday parties. I remember hiding right here, during a game of hide-and-seek. It took me a couple of hours to realize no one was going to find me. I forgot about that. All the parents were pretty worried about you. Parents were worried. And I was worried. I was worried I was going to miss out on all that cake and ice cream. So I got myself back down to the party. It was a great cake. Fun party too. You know what? I also remember running into you at the picnic, about five years ago now. Lauren, look, I did you a favor, believe me. You were a school teacher, and people would of talked. I promise. They talked anyway. No. But the stories would of been much different. Yeah, but I would not of cared. Sorry. Wish I could sleep that well. With 2,000 homes without power and the main roads closed, we're asking those without shelter to call the emergency hotline. Shelters have been set up at community centers across the state. Lauren. I'm so sorry. This is my house. This is where I grew up. All of my memories are here. Lauren, a lot of this stuff isn't ruined. You know, you just dry it out, get the water out of it before the mould sets in. I guess. You guess? Things are just things, Lauren. No, but they were my things though. Right. But they weren't you. They weren't Dancer. They weren't your parents. I know. You're right. I'm going to rebuild this house myself. -Yeah? -Yes. I know I can do it. When I was a little girl, I would sit there and I'd watch my parents fix everything, everything in our house. Then I grew up and I learned how to do the same. My dad and I built that barn that kept us safe last night. And, I've watched hours and hours of home reno shows. Well, one thing's for sure. It's going to be a lot of work. But, you know, I can help, if you want. No, but, it's rewarding work. And it's the summer so I have time to do it before school starts. I could build this house exactly how I've always wanted it to be. I think this might be a good thing, a sign. -A sign? -Yes. How's that? You know, I've been feeling a little stuck lately. Just a little down. And I think this might be a good chance to rebuild myself. So, Lauren. What do you want to do next? First I'm going to stop feeling sorry for myself. I know there are plenty of folks out there who are way worse off than I am. Stranded, hurt, who knows what. Yup. I was actually thinking about that earlier this morning. Thought about maybe going into town, checking everybody, check the damage. Well, let's go do that. Yeah. All right. All right. Why don't we throw on a change of clothes. Collin, I'm sorry about last night. What about? Bringing up the past. I shouldn't have done that. No, I'm sorry about that day at the fair. Thank you, but you are allowed to date whoever you want. Believe me. You did dodge a bullet with me, okay. Being single is kind of my lot in life, I guess. What about you? Anyone you're seeing? Yeah, my boyfriend Dane. Well he's my fiancé actually. Well, kind of. Kind of? What's a kind of fiancé? What's this? -Frida. -Collin. Lauren. Hey Frida. How are you and Hector doing? We're good, can't say as much for Mayor Wallace. Did you hear? No, what happened? Heart attack. He was checking on some people and a tree fell, landed on the hood of his car. Just like that. He didn't make it. There's never been a storm like this recorded in the county's history. We're all praying that they're aren't any more casualties. I can't believe this. Thank you so much, Frida. Drive safe. You too, Collin. The roads are in bad shape. Hey Sutter, it's Collin. Yeah, I know. How are you? You're not in the hospital or anything, are you? It looked bad pretty bad up there last night. Yeah. No, not a scratch. I'm relieved. How's Colin? Mom. Not a scratch. His words. He's fine. How's the house? It should be fine up there. I actually haven't checked in on it yet. I spent the night at Lauren Christiansen's farm. Excuse me? What did Collin say? Nothing, Mom. He didn't say anything. Send him my love. Yeah, he sends his love to you too. You want to explain? I'm fine. But her house was destroyed in the storm. That's awful. And good of you to take care of her. No. She is actually the one who took care of me. She actually got me in out of the storm, kept me dry. How did you end up at her place? I mean I know you've got that property up there next to hers, but you said you don't work it. Yeah, it's a long story. It's just, her dog, the storm, a fallen oak tree... Hey, Sutter, listen. I got to go. This is the only line that we have. Okay. Just tell me one thing. Is she still as good looking as I remember? Better. You be good to her, Collin. Yeah, tell Mom I love her. I already did. Later. See you. Okay Sarah, glad everyone's well. So how'd the Chumaks make out? The road to their barn washed out completely. But they got their animals out early. They did? That's some good news, I guess. Going back to what I said earlier, about helping you rebuild your house. It'll be no trouble. It's okay. I can figure it out. Thank you. It's not that I think you need a man's help, or anything like that. It's just, you know what I do for a living, right? Yes you make furniture. I'm a carpenter. A pretty good carpenter, actually. So helping you with your house would be no problem. It's a really nice offer, but no thank you. The phone's free, so I'm going to call my fiance. You have Dane. Hey, it's me. Lauren! My assistant has been trying you for hours. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Um, but my entire house was destroyed. And sorry, I would have called earlier but all the power is out, all the phone lines are down. Your house was destroyed, but my Lauren's okay? I'm fine, I promise. You should move into my Manhattan condo while I'm still closing this deal. And then when I'm done, I'll meet you there. You want me to leave at a time like this? Dane, I can't do that. The community needs every single one of us here right now. Look, I just want you to be safe. Thank you. That, that's sweet, but I'm going to stay here and I also want to rebuild my family home myself. Listen, give me a couple hours, I'm going to talk to my assistant. He's going to find you the best crew in the tri-state area. They'll be there this afternoon to start construction. A crew? No. No no no no. It's way too early for any of that. You're going to supervise, of course. Dane Richards - you have zero listening skills. My grandparents built that family home and I'm going to do the same. Lauren, Lauren, I'm just trying to help. You're a school teacher, you can't build a house by yourself. I know it takes a team to rebuild a home. But that team starts with me. Hey, I need you in here. Excuse me? Sorry, that was rude. And that is why we need to get people out there now starting the clean up efforts. This is crazy. The council has made a list of places to start. George, you can look after food and beverage at the park. Nathan, I know you're doing your best with Mayor Wallace gone and all, but we need to organize search parties to go out there to find the people who need help. I just spoke with the people from FEMA less than an hour ago. They need the roads clear so they can deliver the relief supplies - food, water, medicine. Right. Search and rescue is the main priority right now. You said yourself that FEMA was not going to be here for several days. This is not about you, Collin. Please sit down. Nathan, given the circumstances, I feel we should set aside our differences. Now here, we look out for each other. That's what we do. So there are going to be people out there without clean water, without power, they could be injured, they could be sick. We've got to have search parties to get out there and find those people. Yeah. He's right. Collin's right. People, people. Our fire department is out there right now doing exactly just that. Well, great. We can help them. How many firefighters are there? We have five, well-trained professionals. Five? Nathan, that's a lot of ground to cover. And we should split those five up. And each one of those firefighters can be in charge of a small search party of volunteers. We can search the entire town in a day, a day and a half at max. So we'd have five search parties? Five. Fine. Council will radio out to the professionals and if the firefighters agree, council will allow it. Nathan, I'd like to suggest that we pause for a moment in remembrance of our mayor Mitchell Wallace. I was just about to suggest that. We remember our Mayor Wallace fondly. As we offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife Paula. Lord we thank you for keeping our beloved Mitchell in your care. We give thanks for those who are safe and we ask for your help and encouragement for the long road that lies ahead. Amen. Amen. All right. It won't be easy. But together we can do it. Paige! I'm so happy to see you. I've been looking everywhere for you. We tried to get to you. I'm so glad you two made it through the storm okay. Yeah, we're fine, we're fine. Hey, how are you and Mark? We just lost the porch and the shed. How about your place? Not as bad as some. My heart goes out to Carolina Santos. Mine too. You know, maybe we should get a few activities or something, from the classroom just to give those kids something to do. Yeah, five kids can drive you crazy fast. Her husband's trying to get home on Friday so they can both be together. If the roads are open. True. Hey! Was that Collin I saw you waving at just now? Yeah, yeah. He's helping out with one of the search and rescue teams. Yeah, I heard he was helping, but why are you waving at each other? You hate him. No, I don't hate him. Really. I have heard you say the actual words: "I hate Collin Traub." I'm just worried about him. Paige, I'm worried about everybody. It's dangerous out there. There are live power lines down, there are complete road closures. So when exactly did the hate stop? Well last night we spent the night together in the barn... Lauren! Tell. Me. Everything! No, nothing happened. No. We just got to know each other a little better, that's all. Okay, let's help with the potluck, and you are telling me every detail. Come on! ♪ Nothing! Useless technology. Help! Help me! Anybody. Help me! Mr. Rodriguez! Are you in there? Yes! I'm here! I got knocked off my wheelchair. My leg is stuck. Stay calm. We have the rescue team here. We'll clear this debris and we'll get you out. Bless you! I've been stuck here for hours. We're here now. We'll have you out shortly. So, did you hear? What? The chicken's a little dry, but the mac-n-cheese is to die for? Nope. Your boyfriend is a hero. Yeah? Dane's in Australia. What could he have done? No! Your "new" boyfriend. I am an engaged woman. So you officially accepted Dane's proposal then? Not exactly. See? I love Dane. I have no interest in Collin except as friends. And besides, he made it very clear in the past that he was never interested either. Wait. Hero? He saved Mr. Rodriguez. What happened? Hugo fell out of his wheelchair and spent the entire storm on the floor of his bedroom. He was lucky that Collin found him. Is he going to be okay? Yeah, thank heavens. Joel, he's a firefighter, said Collin cleared the debris and carried Hugo out to the team. Really? Joel said if they hadn't split up like Collin suggested, they wouldn't have gotten to Hugo for a few more days. And who knows what would have happened by then? We have got ourselves a real-life hero. Well if you're not interested, maybe I should ask him out. I think you should stop talking and eat some chicken. I hear it's dry. Stay here. ♪ How bad was it out there? More tough than bad. Why do I feel like you chose the areas that were hardest hit to search? I guess I should've thought that one through a little bit more. You must be exhausted. Compared to what we did. Answering phones, ordering a few supplies. Come on. I saw well-fed children in clean clothes who looked very happy. I know that was all your doing. Paula helped too. So tell me about this fiancé. Dane. Um, Dane is an architect. He's actually in Australia right now. He's working on a big project, and then he'll be back here. Is he a good man? Yes. Yes, he's very good to me. But? But, when you're with the person you're supposed to marry, you have this gut feeling. Right? Right. Unless he isn't. No no no no. That's okay. Don't be silly, you're freezing. Just take it. -Thank you. -You're welcome. You should run for mayor. Because I gave you my jacket? No. Although I would vote for that guy. I'm pretty sure Nathan wouldn't offer me his jacket. Well, his heart is in the right place. Yeah, maybe. The way you corralled the search and rescue team, and how you helped Mr. Rodriguez, it's... Joel saved Mr. Rodriguez. Okay, I just moved some things out of the way. That's all. We need a good leader in this town. And I'm not so sure that Nathan is the person for that. You should think about it. Nah, I think I'll leave running this town to better men. Who said that? You send whoever said that my way and I'll give them a good talking to. Really? What would you say? In under 72 hours, a man who thought I hated him. Hey! You did hate me. -Shhh, I'm talking. -Okay. Although that's fair. This man saved my dog. Helped scores of people. And offered to rebuild my family house. Which you refused. Which I appreciated. It's the intent that matters. And he offered me this lovely jacket because he thought I was cold. You know what, if you're not cold, I'd be more than happy to take the jacket back. Okay, I was just joking! Dane, he's a, he's a lucky guy. We should call it a night, I think. Yeah, I think so. ♪ Nathan. Hey, have you seen Collin anywhere? Yeah, he went with the firefighters to check on the last few homes. Then he's heading up one of the clean up crews. Cell service is back. You can call him if you like. Aw, that's great news. Nathan? How do you feel about starting a crowd funding campaign? It's perfect. I mean the community needs help getting back on its feet. I'm not sure insurance is going to pay that much. That's exactly how I feel. I know the homes to the west of the city were the hardest hit. I counted 22 exactly, including yours. Let's say 21. I think I'll be okay. Why don't I get some photos of the community just to kind of show the country what were going through here. Perfect. Want to meet up tomorrow? I'll text you. Hey Dane. My beautiful Lauren. How's everything flood-wise this morning? It was a beautiful day, down under. Yeah, we're doing okay. Things are still a little bit of a disaster, but we're all pulling through. That's my girl. Yeah. So, when are you getting here? Come again? Sorry. Yeah, yeah. When is your project wrapping up so you can come help. Help. I'm happy to help. Just give me the number. I'll wire the cash. Cash? No. No no no no. Dane this is not about cash. Okay? I don't need money. Dane, I need you here. Dancer, come on. You want to help Tony with the lumber? All right. Excuse me! Hello, hi. What's going on here? Looks like we're rebuilding somebody's home. Yes, this is my house. You must be... Lauren Richards. It's Lauren Christensen. Did a man named Dane put you up to this? Mr. Richards hired us, yes. I need everybody off my property right now! Excuse me, Miss? Yes! I need everybody to get off of my property. Right now! Thank you. I don't need strangers rebuilding my family house. But we've already been paid to do the work. Okay, you can actually take all of your work and go work on the Santos' family barn, down the road. Miss, I'm going to have to check with the office. No, no problem. Do whatever you need to do but then you can remove all the crew and go over there. Okay? There will be a ton of debris. You'll see it. And there are five young children who desperately need your help. Thank you. Guys! Take five! You have Dane. Dane! What is going on at my property right now? Lauren, guess what? I got my assistant to get a great crew. They're going to be there any minute now. Yeah. They're all working here right now. Great, they said they'd be fast. No Dane! I told you I wanted to rebuild my family home myself. But, I just wanted to support. Dane, you are a great guy, you really are. You have treated me like gold. But there is one thing that has become crystal clear to me and that is that you have never treated me like an equal. All my thoughts, all my feelings, have been completely second to yours. What? Lauren... I... It's like you never listened. That time I told you I didn't want to go to London. Or that I didn't need that new car. Or that I will never give up being a teacher. Dane, I can't do this anymore. I can't marry you. Lauren.

Well. Add it to the list. Holy cow, Lauren. How did you build this, this fast? It wasn't me. Dane made a few calls. Dane. Fiancé Dane. Yeah. Fiancé Dane. Got to hand it to him. His men do quick work. Yeah, well. Now they can do quick work for Carolina Santos. That's a good call. You think? Yeah. Absolutely. I've heard you go on about a dozen times about building this yourself. So, it's clearly important to you. I agree. Thank you. Hey listen. Also, I need to apologize about last night You know, we, we almost... Yeah, we almost, but we didn't. Right. Right. That's the important thing. Yeah, because, emotions were high... I don't know. I guess that just... who would of thought? The sanctuary? At night? It would of been nice, shall we say. The stained glass windows were really nice, as well. It won't happen again. I can promise. Good call. So, what's next for you and this house, Miss Lauren? This house... Well, actually I was hoping to recruit a nice strong person to help me lift some heavy furniture. I guess that's me. All right. Just a few feet back there. Pivot to your right. Got it. And then just go right to that wall. -Okay we're here. -Yup. Amazing. Okay, I just need your help with this trunk over here. One or two things? Ready? It just goes over here. This is my grandpa's old tool set. And his original plans for the house. You okay? Yeah, who doesn't want a chance to remodel? Right? Plus it gives me an excuse to watch all the home reno shows I want. Next thing you know, I'll be flipping, I'll be flopping. I did want to do it myself, though. Listen, I understand, but Dane's people, they did an amazing job. Okay, because they left the entire foundation. They put up the perimeter wall so you can completely design the layout. And you can move the kitchen over here to right here to get better sunlight during the day. And right here, you can add a little breakfast nook. Who doesn't love breakfast, right? And this, if you extend the mud room out a little bit, you'll have an extra bedroom. Or an office. Or an office. Anything you want. Now this is your place. Collin, these are good ideas. I think they are all for tomorrow's work, though. Sounds good. I think I'm going to hit the hay, literally. What do you mean? I think I'm going to spend the night in the barn again tonight. By yourself? Well, with Dancer. No, I wasn't implying that I would stay with you. I just, why not go back to the relief center? You know why? Because a really nice guy helped me fix up my bedroom in there. And I'd like to embrace that. Although the cots would probably be the smarter decision. Look, I'm going back there tonight myself. So if you need a ride, I'd be more than happy. Why? I thought your house was fine. No, it's fine. I'm just going to go back in case anybody needs some help. The thing about here, you have no running water. You don't have a working washroom. I think the relief center will be a better idea. So come back, be there with the townspeople, and myself. You flipped me. That's funny. I used to have a jacket just like that. - Is that right? - That's right. Come on, Dancer. ♪ Clean up efforts are ongoing and the mounting cost of damage are hitting residents very hard. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those suffering during this time. It looks great, you two. Hey. Did you get some good photos? I got way too many photos. This is going to show the world what we're going through. Yeah, I got the same response. Everyone wanted to share their story. I get it. You know, it's cathartic. Here, take a look at this. It's my first draft. Nathan, this opening is really good. You can really write. I've asked the search and rescue teams to get pictures of the homes to me, so we can quickly build a page once there are all in. I haven't been as far over as the Santos. They have nothing.

Got you a little lunch. -Thank you. -You're welcome. So, I have a question for you. Okay. Mr. Collin ladies' man. How come you haven't found a lady yourself yet? I don't know that I've been a ladies' man for quite some time now. I might of actually outgrown that. Don't avoid the question. -Honestly? -Honestly. My dad. I remember your dad. He left a few years back, no? Yeah. After he cheated on my mother more than once. I was the youngest of five boys, much younger than the other ones and my mom was, I guess, just kind of worn out by the time that I came around. That might of been why I was such an unruly kid. 'Unruly'. Is that what we're calling it? Well, she just didn't have the time, or the energy, to supervise me and younger Collin might of taken advantage of that. But my mom, she was there for me in so many other ways. You know. I wasn't a good student by any stretch. Kids made fun of me. But my mom, after taking care of five boys, after cooking dinners and cleaning the house and going through letters from my teachers, she would actually sit down and tutor me every night. And it worked. I got better grades, I grew a few inches and kids stopped making fun of me as much. Moms - you gotta love 'em. Dads, not so much. Apparently mine was spending time all over town. My mom, she never talked about it, to any of us. One night we were at my brother's wedding. We were sitting there, just the two of us and she finally told me everything that he had done, how badly he had hurt her. And, that was the night I promised her I would never be like him. I would never be my father. And I might have been the resident "ladies' man", as you put it, but I never cheated. Never. But you can't spend your whole life pushing people away, though Collin. It's worked so far. But... Listen, I want to make a suggestion. Okay? We've made a lot of progress on this house. Great progress. Yes we have. But we have some pretty big jobs coming up, roofing, electrical, plumbing. So, with your permission, I have some friends who could probably help with that to get you in your home a little quicker. Okay. I could be open to that. Great. So, who are these mysterious 'friends' of yours? Lauren, I don't know if you remember any of my old friends. But they just got back from clearing the main road out to the highway. Dev, we got Shawn and Ciro. Yeah yeah. Dev, good to see you again. Lauren, how have you been? Hey, take it easy, she's got a fiancé now. I'm just saying 'hi'. Shawn, good to see you. Ciro, thank you, thank you. Well Dev, how do you feel about plumbing? I feel great about plumbing. I had a job with a plumber back in college. Let me flush it out. No kidding. Okay, I'm going to get started on the roof. Does anyone know much about electrical? Electrical. Me and Shawn, we got it. I thought I was going to get a 'no' there. Don't worry, we've done the circuit. Well I'm not that qualified, but I can lift heavy things. I'm sure you can, Ciro. Guys, this means so much to me. Honestly. Thank you so so much. Sorry. Hey, this is really good news. What? Yeah, it's Nathan. He says we are getting tons of media attention on the crowd funding page. -That's awesome. -So awesome! Now we just got to wait and see if the world wants to help out. They will. They'll see how much damage this storm did, they'll help. I know. Just have faith. Okay?

Thanks so much, you guys. Thank you! Wow. I cannot believe how much progress we've made on this house. Well, the Amish can build a barn in a day. So by that standard, we're kind of far behind schedule. Yeah, but, seriously, your friends are really awesome. That Ciro can really lift heavy things. Yeah, they're all right, I guess. They're all right and you're all right. Just take credit for what an awesome friend you've been. Friend. Yes, you are helping me to rebuild my house. Well, I think I'm going to spend the night here tonight. There's no interior of the house. How are you going to do that? No, no, not in the house. In the barn. Plus the house has running water, gas, everything I need. By yourself, in the barn? No, with Dancer. Right pup? All right, well, I'll be staying the night at my place, so, you know, if you ever needed a place to crash. Are you trying to spend the night with me? No. I'm just letting you know if you don't feel like staying at the barn by yourself, you have a place. That's sweet of you, but I'm a big girl. I got this. Just offering as a friend. Right. Because that's what we are. Exactly. Friends. Okay, well, I'm going to wash up at the house and then head to the barn. Yeah, great. And I'm going to my truck and head back to the cabin. All right. You can take... - Sure. - This. All right... Good night. Friend. Good night. Friend. "We left you some pizza your buds ” Friends! Friends. Hmph! Friends! Collin, she's asleep in a barn. By herself. What would your mother think if she knew this? You know what? He's not even that good looking, no matter how many times Ciro catches me checking him out. He's not. He's so amazing though. He just doesn't see it. He saved entire families out there. He helped rebuild my house. Friends! My foot! That's it! Lauren! Lauren! Lauren? Lauren! Hello? Hey, Collin, it's me. It's Lauren. Um. Why aren't you answering your door? Wait, you're, you're at my place? Wait, you're not at your place? No. I'm at your place. What are you doing there? I... I was... worried about you. Yeah. Just thought I'd come and check on you. What are you doing at my place? I got scared. Yeah, I was scared staying in that creepy barn by myself. You said it wasn't creepy. No, I know. But it turns out it is. You're at my place. I'm at your place. Yeah, it's pretty funny. Why don't you just crash at my place tonight and I'll stay here. Yeah, no, that sounds great. Very reasonable. Yeah, um, the key to the front door is there on the windowsill. We'll have a big laugh about this tomorrow, Lauren. I'm sure. I know. Okay, good night, Collin. Get some sleep, Lauren. Wow. I remember this. She's got a fiancé, man. She's got a fiancé. Can't... do this. Dancer? Is that you buddy? What are you doing Collin? Sleeping in a pink frilly bed, that's what you're doing. Lauren, what are you doing here? I came here to talk to you. Okay. Is everything all right? No actually, it's not. Okay. I... I... I really like you Collin. I really like you. And actually I came to apologize to you for hating you all of those years after that stupid day at the picnic. Lauren... Because I was just embarrassed. And I was really insecure and I spent years trying to avoid you, thinking you were this horrible person. Even though you're not, at all. I was a horrible person. You're not a horrible person, Collin. You are smart. You're kind. You're a leader. And, okay, I saw the furniture in your house. Wow, talk about talented. And you listen to me. You care about what I have to say. You care about other people, Collin. Do you know how rare that is? I like you. And if I'm being honest, I think you like me too. Lauren. You have a fiancé. I mean, I saw his pictures up in your bedroom, your barn room. Whatever. You two seem incredibly happy together. You deserve him. And I could of handled things so much differently, so much better. But I didn't. No, you were just pushing me away, like you're doing right now. Lauren, how could I not like you? Tell me. You're at the top of the class. The best catch. The most beautiful woman in town. You dedicate your whole life to helping children. You're smart, talented. You're an absolute boss with a nail gun. You give back to other people. You deserve the best. And Lauren, that's not me. History has shown that it's not me. You deserve Dane. I broke up with Dane. When? That day that he, that he brought the crew over and I asked him not to. Why did you do that Lauren? My gut. And because he never listened to me. Why didn't you say something sooner? Because I was so tired of relationships, Collin. You know, and then there's this incredible guy standing right in front of me and I couldn't help but fall for him. Collin, I think I'm falling in love with you. I can't do this. I'm sorry, I thought I could.

Before Lauren needed a new house. I don't need to tell you what mom and dad went through when they were together... Listen, hold on. Mom has five sons, seven grand kids. And she's hoping for a few more. She talks more about the good years than the bad years. With what happened to mom, I promised her I would never hurt somebody like dad hurt her. And you won't. You won't. You are not Dad. Tell me about Lauren. What? You can talk now. Well, I can't stop thinking about her. If that's what you mean. I... I just want to be with her. All the time.

And there's a man on his way to maybe take her away from you forever. Do you really love her? With all my heart. Yeah. Then don't let dad's behavior stop you from maybe being with her forever.
