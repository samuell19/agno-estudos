GOKUDO TOSEI NO SUTEKI NA MENMEN (Those Swell Yakuza) Starring TAKANORI JINNAI YUMI ASO Directed by SEIJI IZUMI You're slacking off. I let you live in this nice place. Be thankful and clean up the neighborhood. Idiot! You haven't swept at all. How am I supposed to know where to sweep? Don't argue. All right. I'll do it. Please let me. Dear? It's been a week. How long are you letting him stay? He wants me to be his brother yakuza. After I beat the shit out of him. He's a strange one, that record shop man. Record shop? I knew he had a history, so I questioned him. He used to be a banker in Utsunomiya. Then he opened a record shop, that fool. But he went bankrupt. Owed a lot of money... The yakuza came after him and he's been running for his life. Being chased by yakuza then wanting to be a yakuza, that's rich. But he's really serious. Just get rid of him. I said if he stuck it out for six months, I'd accept him. Six months? Are you kidding? Pervert. What? Old man, you're in the wrong business. Don't call me old. Huh? What's your connection to Uncle Nakagawa? Since we haven't sworn an oath... I'm a free agent. Free agent? You bastard. Hey, Kunio, he's the same as you. All right. I'll take care of Oshima Construction. Three golf courses, a worthy opponent. Sony about that. I failed at a family job. Every man to his trade. I couldn't do what you do. Brother Kanzaki is connected politically. Until the chain-nan gets out of prison, well be depending on him. Right? Oh, a new guy. He's been staying with me. I'm Sakai. Ryo Sakai. Please remember me. And look upon me with favor from now on. Thank you for your respectful greeting. Ryo. Don't let your senior give me a light. Stay sharp! That's not where it's wanted. Fool. You're late coming into this business. At 24, you should be making up for lost time. I'm sorry. You're new here. You're cute. What's your name? Sayaka. Be careful, Sayaka. Nakagawa's attracted to new girls. Yuka, go away. I have a favor to ask. Idiot You can't collect 15,000 yen? I can't... Ryo. You go. It'll be a learning experience for you. Small debts are called "kiritori." Big one like yours are "oikomi." Remember that. Brother, shall I go? No, it's okay. This guy used to be a banker. Oh, an interesting guy. Hello. Ms. Maeda hand me that document. Mr. Nakanishi, chief clerk sales division one. Mr. Nakanishi. Yuka at Carol Night Club is very unhappy. Please pay your tab of 15,200 yen at once. Hey, stop. Are you Mr. Nakanishi? Yuka of Carol... - You're Nakanishi? - This way. Come. Please don't. I'll get in trouble. Bastard. Yuka's been troubled for six months. Do you want me to yell in front of the president? Well? Moron! Just because you were successful, you think you can slack off and watch TV? If you have time to watch, watch commercials. You can learn a lot. Look, a yakuza's job is to extort money from upstanding folks by making up impossible false claims. So if the commercial says, cake comes first, phone number two, then you ask, "Am I third?" "You're eating better cake for a snack than me, "how dare you!" See, that's how you do it. I see. Do you, you fool! Dear? When are you going to throw that punk out? He asked to be my junior brother. It's my obligation to take care of him until he turns tail and runs. You think you're so cool. Please, Dear? What? We haven't for a month. Don't I don't want Ryo to hear. Go back to your side. You always say that. I know you're playing around. Masayo of Belle, Kayako of Hanazono... You're still seeing her? Don't make it Ryo's fault. Shut up. Why? Be quiet. Ryo? Don't go to the toilet in the middle of the night! Sorry. I haven't had steak in years. It was good. My thanks for collecting the debt. If you like, you can have some prime on top filet below. How about it? Yeah! Hey, Akemi. That you, Akemi? Haven't seen you in ages. Akemi... you must have the wrong person. - Let's go. - Hold on. Stop acting in front of your new man. Hey, she has a mole down there, right? She still scratches when aroused? Stop that. You're despicable. Hey, say that again. Let her go. Stop, Ryo. Don't. He's Kajiyama Family. Hey, stop. Ryo! Ryo. Stop. Die! Get lost. Son of a bitch. Were you serious about fighting him? He would have killed you. If you're gonna fight, have the guts to fight 'til the bitter end. If you can't, then don't fight in the first place. Go to the hospital. Hurry. Ryo. I'm sorry. Let's go to the hospital. We're not an emergency hospital. Don't quibble. The chief doctor is out. Where's the anesthetic? Hey, Doctor. I don't need anesthesia. Hurry and sew it up. But... I said forgot it. Hurry. Wait a second. Doctor Murai. Keiko hold his legs. Now. I won't struggle. So let me hold your hand. Are you sure? - It'll hurt. - I know that. Ready? That hurts. It's done. I've never put seven stitches in without anesthesia. A revolver is better than an automatic. You can only get one shot off on an automatic. But this will let you shoot more. You can't miss. We don't use our guns to steal. We use it to prove we're man enough. Clean it. Dear, Asami's here. I told him not to come here. Be careful with that. Ryo. Hey, Ryo. Get down here. This is the loan document and a 2-million-yen bounced check. You used to be a banker, know what this means? With these, you're a legitimate debt collector. No one can say you're an extortionist. Think you can collect all of it? I'll try. Hmmm... he didn't tum a hair. Katakura family? I'm not afraid of yakuza. Listen. I'm afraid of being hit by a falling iron plate, but not of you guys. What? You've sent your minion? No problem. Send ten or twenty. Excuse me... Is this Yokota Engineering? Who are you? I'm with Azusa Kai. Oh yeah? You came alone? Your debt has reached 2 million. Could you please pay? Are you a dimwit? I've been a yakuza for one mon... five years. I'm going to become a big shot. Oh yeah? You must be suffering but the people who got the bounced check are in an even worse situation. And it's a problem for me, too. That may be, but I can't give you what I don't have. Go home. I said go! Oh yeah? You think you can scare me? I told you to leave. Are you all right? You did this. Damn you. What are you doing? What do you think? I'm calling the cops. An innocent citizen is about to get killed. This is attempted murder. - Hello, is this the police? - Hey, hold on. I said wait. If they throw you in prison on attempted murder, and if you go away for a long time, this company would go bankrupt. Let's talk this out. - Ow... - Let's talk. If we talk, we can come to a settlement. You think? I do. Then why don't you take responsibility now? If something happens to you, I'll come right over. I'm Ryo Sakai, Azusa Kai. I'll pay. Okay. I'll pay. Hey, not bad, Ryo. He said he only had one-and-a-half million in cash, so I said okay. At least you got most of it. They get half of the recovered money, so they'll be happy. This is your first big job, so I'll give you half of my take... That's howl feel, but since you're still apprenticing, I'll give you half of that. You did good. Thank you. Doctor? Is that cute nurse off duty today? Cute nurse? I think her name is Keiko. Keiko is my daughter and she's at school. Your daughter? I heard you're associating with Taiwan yakuza in Shinjuku. Is that true? What's wrong with that? The reason they've been acting big recently is drugs. Because the Kajiyama family want the drugs, they kowtow to them. That's why they're moving into Shibuya, too. You saying I'm involved with drugs? I know you wouldn't do that. Our group doesn't condone drugs. The cops will raid the Taiwan yakuza soon. That's why I want you to be extra careful about associating with them. Sure. Mr. Nakagawa. This is good. Have some. We're getting eight new women from the Philippines. They're all young dancers, so they'll make us money. Do you want a taste before they start? I don't touch the merchandize. That's admirable. Mr. Nakagawa, drugs make more money than women. You can have your own building for Azusa Kai dealing drugs. Mr. Chan. I told you I won't deal drugs. You're straight-laced. I love being first at the bathhouse. Hey, Ryo. Scams are the way to go for yakuza now. If you're smart, money and women will be yours. Hey, are you listening? That's good. The first apartment Akiyo and I had didn't have a toilet or a bath. We used to go to bathhouses all the time. That's why I still come from time to time. That was the signal I was done. Uncle. - Brother. - Brother, what's wrong? The organized crime unit cop called me. Taiwan yakuza Chan was arrested for drug dealing. What! Your name came up in the investigation. Brother. I told you I never deal drugs. All right. Brother, sorry to have barged in like this. Forgive me. Fool, don't just stand there. I'll catch cold. Close the door. Hey, beer. Co-ed? Flavored vodka? Oh, you! How's your wound? I can finally drink again. Then let's toast to your speedy recovery. Sure. - Cheers. - Cheers. You asked Dad where's the cute nurse named Keiko. How come? Er, well... What do you do? Me? Lots of things... yakuza. Liar. You have such sweet eyes. What do you think? A budding illustrator or a camera assistant. So you think I'm not much. Is your father well? So you go to college? What year? Do you have a boyfriend? I'm getting married.” A virgin bride. So this is a pre-celebration? Drowning my sorrows. Your father's wrong. That's right. Isn't he? He's... my father... is ambitious. He wants to head a large general hospital. Hey, you okay? So he arranged a marriage for you to someone you don't love? He's the only son of a real estate company. A promising young employee of Kagami Trading. I can never love him. Hey! You must be cold. Thank you. You're so kind. Mr. Yakuza. I don't care what happens to me. Oh yeah? Then come. Oh, a love hotel. I know. This is where the man says, "Let's go in shall we?" Like it was no big deal. That's right. Let's go in. No! No. Pervert. Hey, Lady. You in trouble? Oh, a pervert? What'd you say? I'm not a sideshow. Wait, Yakuza. Running away? Bastard. Yakuza shouldn't run. Hey where are you going? Going home. I hope I didn't say anything stupid when I was drunk. Just a bit. Oh, no. I was teasing. I'm sorry. For what? For not being honest with my feelings. Let me clean your room for you. I bet you have a mountain of laundry. My place is really bad. I'm moving to a better place soon. What? Next time, when I'm not drunk. Next Saturday, April 12th, 2 p.m. In front of the Hachiko statue. I'll keep this scarf until then. A small but clean apartment... What's your budget? Seventy thousand yen. What's your occupation? Self-employed. Sony, I can't help you. Excuse me, I'm looking for an apartment. Do you have anything for about fifty thousand? Sure. A very good one. This way. Hey! I'll take that apartment. It's a women-only building. Liar! That's discrimination. Brother. I was cleared. The cops were profusely apologetic. I heard. Sony! made a big deal. I get real upset when it comes to drugs. I told the cops no one in Azusa Kai deals drugs. Have a drink. I want to. But if I do, I'll be seeing double. You won't drink with me? Just tonight? How about it? Hey! I'll drink with you when I'm done here. You've come up in the world. You're holding up Azusa Kai today. Although I'm a year older than you, you're the only one that can order me around. Brother, I apologize about the bathhouse. To coin a phrase... it's hot water under the bridge. You shouldn't be drinking. You have a bad liver. Shut up! I just said I won't take orders from you. Drink. Bastard! Brother. What happened? - Kanzaki did this. - Uncle Kanzaki? He damaged my face. I want satisfaction. I'll kill him. I'll kill that bastard. Brother. Are you all right? Shut up. An eye for an eye. A man's nothing without respect. In this business, that's the end. Dear. Dear. Are you all right? You got drunk and got into a fight again. I'll kill him. Bastard. I'll kill him. What do you want? Uncle Kanzaki. - What the... - You! What's the meaning of this? What! You shot Kanzaki? I'm going to the police. I'll take this. I won't tell them where I got it. Ryo! Hey, Ryo. He did it for me. He's really something. Dear? You're soft. If Ryo comes back, he'll be a hero, but how are you going to settle this? If things go badly, you're dead. He's here. What? He's here. Please take it. Boss, you're not going to accept it are you? - Kill him. - Yeah! Shut up. I'm trying to have a talk with Brother. I know a finger's not enough. That's why I'm here. Do as you please. Stop that. All right, Brother. I never dreamt I'd be shot by one of my own. I thought it was between you and me. But now that I think about it, I was wrong, too. I was the one who started it. But that Ryo, he's pretty gutsy for a greenhorn, right, Brother? Uncle Ariga is here. Looks like you've talked it out. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Others will take advantage, if we're at each other's throats while the chain-nan is away. Got that? Hey. How about a smoke? What? Sit down. Let me go, Cop! Stop the van! Be still. Three Years Later... What are you doing here? Bastard! Why are you here? Get out of the way. Boss. Come in. I'm Ryo. I got out today. I came to apologize. Prison is an admirable institution. It matures a man. Hey. Sit. You have to set yourself up now. Since you're just out, it may be hard, but I'm giving you one of my men. Brother Nakagawa agreed. He's a difficult person. He tolerated only you and Asami. No others would work for him. Hey! Excuse me. I'm with you, Brother. Ryo, you did your time. You can call me Brother any time. Brother. Welcome. Hello. Welcome. We're celebrating Ryo's release. Let's have a good time. Okay, Kaori? I'm Kaoru. That's right, Kaoru. Welcome back, Ryo. Have you forgotten me? See, I told you he wouldn't remember you. Oh, you're Yuka... Club Carol. Yes! I win. You're mine tonight. First time in three years. I'm exhausted. I'm going to die. That's why returnees are popular. Patting yourself on the back? I feel like I've had enough for ten years. This... It's the scar from that time? Yeah. I'm sorry. It's a nice room. You just noticed? I was distracted. I'm leaving this place. The real estate business is in a recession. My real estate patron left me. So haven't paid in three months. An available girl and a ex-con's a good combination. Or do you have a girlfriend? Yeah. Oh, You do? Hey. If you were going out with a real estate agent, you must know about being in possession? What's that? Just because you can't pay, that doesn't mean you get evicted with nothing. I'm going to rent this room from you. We'll sign an official lease. When the guy who won the foreclosure auction comes to evict, I'm going to demand an eviction fee. Well split the proceeds. Clever! Look, Brother. Expecting a visitor? Who's there? Welcome home. I told the manager I was your sister. That old womanizer. Get out. Why? I waited three years for you. You know where I was during that time? Prison. If you know, get out! This is no place for a girl like you. Brother, I forgot I have something to do. Bye. That day, I--- ...waited for you by the Hachiko statue. You didn't come. I got your address from your medical file and went to your place. It was Mr. Nakagawa's house. His wife told me everything. She asked me if I was your girlfriend. Don't. No. Aren't you married? Don't be a tease. Stop. You really were yakuza. I told you. But you have such kind eyes. I'm sorry. That your first man is a yakuza. I thought you'd gotten married. That day changed my life. That day, when you didn't come, I got engaged but I just couldn't go through with it. I broke the engagement, argued with my dad... After I graduated from college last year, I left home and I work in an office of a trading firm. So it's all my fault. See, you're so kind. My hand remembered. It said I had to see you to make sure. This hand brought us two together. There. Honey, stop. Shut up. I'm not a dog. Hey, what are you doing? Shut up! Hey, what do you think you're doing? What're you going to do about it? Stop it. Enough already. Haven't you had enough? Stop it. Honey. Honey? Is that all you've got? What? Is that all Azusa Kai can dole out? Is that it? Don't you think you've done enough? Hit me. Are you both out of your mind? Wait a second. Honey! All right. I've made up my mind. You're strong. I want to work for you. You beg, too. I've decided. I won't get up till you say okay. - Please. - Please. Listen, they have no intention of paying. If they complain, kick a desk over and bark him one on the shin. If you use your hands, it'll be extortion, so be careful. I know. Go. Going now. We're going now. Be careful. Hey, something's burning. Oh, no! I did it. Hey, if I eat that, I'll get cancer. Who's there? It's me. It's Kido. Is Ryo here? I got out today. How did you find me? You kidding? We're in the same business. Hmm, she looks like an ordinary girl. Me? I'm Sakai's wife. Oh? You're pretty. Mind if I come in? Please come in. Hey this is a nice honeymoon nest. Why are you here? Oh, this is really nice. What? Tuition. You got this apartment using the possession trick I taught you in prison... Getting an eviction fee colluding with the former tenant. You're sharp. I'm right aren't I? Pay up. I'm broke. They haven't put it up for auction yet. That's not good. Then maybe I'll stay here for a while. Hey, I don't need any freeloaders. I don't have time to freeload. I'm going to make all the money I can then go to Spain. - Spain? - Yeah. Business' global now. I'm kidding. I'm on parole so I'm going to make a run for it. All right. Let's talk about it next time. I have to go out, so leave. Not even a cup of tea? Oh, tea. Right away. - You don't have to. - Oh, Missus. It's all right. Don't bother. You're cute. Hey, lay off her. Brother, don't you think that's enough? Yes? Yes? All right. I'll bring it. What's the matter? Brother wants me to bring 50,000 yen to a mahjong parlor in Maruyama. I'll go. Brother. Get a hold of yourself. You shouldn't be pulling all-nighters. None of your business. Are you all right? If your wife sees you like this... Ryo, how dare you talk to me like that. Brother! Pops, how much? Have you forgotten I'm the president of my company? - I didn't mean it like that. - Then what? Go away. Shut up. Brother. Brother, are you all right? Brother! Advance on the eviction fee of 2 million yen and the two-year rent we said we paid together comes to ten million. We did it, Brother. We got it all in cash to boot, which means I had a lot to do with it. So I'd settle for 2 million for my contribution. What? I told you in prison. In our profession, if you make money because of a story that you were told, the teller gets 10 percent. That's stupid. Hey, don't get greedy all of a sudden. So hand over 2 million. Hey, Ryo, this isn't kid's play. Enough of this fooling around. You play dirty. There's no such thing in the yakuza profession. Listen, Ryo, there's yakuza like you who will lay down his life for the family, and those like me who're in it for themselves. We've got to make every opportunity count. We have to use our heads. It's a sad situation. Here you go. That was an expensive story. We've got to help each other out. I'll give you a good tip again, Ryo. Bye. He's pretty slick. What's the matter? Are you sick? Sony about this. I'm falling apart. There's 4 million here. That's your share. Thanks. I can go home with my head high. Home? I'm so weary. - Where's home? - Ojiya in Niigata. They get the most snow in Japan. I came to Tokyo thinking I'd find something better. But in eleven years, there was nothing. Just one... I met you. I thought! could be happy being your girlfriend. But you'd found such a cute girl in the meantime. But it's all right. I'm glad I met you. Please. Make love to me. Just tonight. I promise. Please give me one good memory to hold on to. Ryo... Make love tome like you mean it. - Oh, it's you. - I was waiting for you. What were you thinking? Playing stupid tricks. Hey, that's mine. Where'd you get it? Look good? No. Ryo? Did you had an affair? I'm kidding. But you look guilty. HEY, I'm yakuza. Nothing wrong with yakuza having affairs. If you do, I'll kill you and kill myself. So tell me when you have an affair. When I decided to many a yakuza, I was prepared for it. But no, please don't. If you do, I'll have an affair, too. Do as you like. Delicious. Section Chief. I can't believe a solid company like yours would bounce two checks for 10 and 20 million yen, totaling 30 million. Thank you for coming. Mr. Sakai, of Azusa Kai? Toa company is in difficulties right now, but they promise to make them good. Could you wait ten days? But it's way overdue. I'll take responsibility. I'm Minami of Kajiyama Family. That should be good enough. All right. Hey, how's the stomach wound? Was just a scratch. - Hey, ' What? See you soon. Hun-y up and get ready. You're the one who wanted to go to dinner. I won't be long. What have you been working on? A bullet-proof vest. Vest? If you wear this, you'll be safe no matter what comes your way. I can't wear this. It's cowardly. You're going to be a father soon. What? Kumi, you've been deceiving me. I told you to get an abortion. You bitch. No. I don't want a kid. Go to the doctor now. I told you I didn't want a kid until I was on my own two feet. All right, I'll do it for you. I'll do it. Damn you. Ow... It's moving. What? The baby's kicking. Honey, the baby's moving. Brother, can I be excused? Sure. We'll celebrate our new office tonight. Don't be late. You'll take it? Wrap it for him. Can a pregnant woman wear this? Yes. How much? 13,800 yen. Don't worry. I have money. Hey, can I have that scissors? Oh, sorry. Ten million. It's all there. It was supposed to be 30 million. What? - Watch your mouth! - Nemoto. Toa Construction can't make payment. I'm paying on their behalf. Could you wait ten days for the rest? I'm begging you in front of my underlings. I can't wait. This is business. I trusted your word. Because you were Minami of Kajiyama family. All right, I'll wait a week. We'll meet here again next week. Damn him. He embarrassed Boss. Bastard! I'd like someone like him in my family. Looking good isn't what yakuza's all about. Be more serious about your job! Hey, everyone, a bonus. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thanks. Honey... Brother... It's not for you. It's for Kumi's baby. Thank you. Honey. Did you hear that? Fool. I won't take the baby's money. Thank you. Let me help. - Kumi, you sit. - I'm fine. A new building feels great. You think? When the kid is born, your current apartment will be too small. And you haven't had a wedding yet. I'd love to wear a white wedding dress. Not your style. I look good in white. Let her. You should wear a white tux and it'll be a wedding with a kid. Ryo. Why don't you be the baby's godfather? Good idea. What the hell are you saying, you idiot! Brother, today's my tum to take care of the headquarter office. Oh yeah? Hey, Keiko. Give him my coat. It's not a tux, but it's cold outside. Thank you. - You should eat first. - No, I'm fine. Thank you, Sister. Use my car. - Bye. - See you later. Kumi... Honey. Why'd you use the money I sewed into the vest? You fool. Used it to buy sake, didn't you? You're a fool. The baby's moving around. I know he's a boy. I'll bring him up to be a real man. He'll be like you, a spirited child. I made one for each of you. Please use it. Why did this have to happen? I'm so sorry. So sorry. We came out ahead. Yeah, we go Minami to cut his finger and had them shell out 10 million for the deceased. It couldn't be better. All due to Uncle Ariga. But we know Kajiyama did it reluctantly. Ryo. They'll be gunning for you. Be careful. But did you see the look on Kajiyama's face? Sister, please. Thank you. You're opening a bar? That's good. There was a great place in Udagawa, so I rented it stock and all. But we don't have enough funds. We did put down a down payment. How much more do you need? About 2 million yen. There's 300,000 there. I'll deliver the rest in a day or two. Thank you, Ryo. Take it. Sister, sorry I'm late. Ryo. I should have gone to you. Here. Thank you, Ryo. Please. It's a great bar. Oh, Ryo. I didn't know you were here. I'll be right back. After we sold the house, I was going to put him in a hospital. But he refused to go. He probably will want to drink with you. Don't let him. Hey, I haven't seen you around. Too busy to have a drink with me? I'm sorry. I have to keep an eye on the greenhorns. Hey, Akiyo beer. Oh, Brother, I can't. - What? - I can't drink. What? I became diabetic in prison. In prison? I've never heard of such a thing. It's true. I can't get it up anymore. But I heard you shacked up with a cutie. Why didn't you bring her around? She's still not my wife. But if you have sex, it's the same thing. Oh, that must be it. She's insatiable. That's probably why. In any case, the doctor said no alcohol. Can't we just split one beer? All right. Just a little bit. Bring the beer. That suit looks expensive. It's not. Dear? We have to thank Ryo for the money. Here you go. Hey. Sorry. All right. I'll be there in five. Damn it. Having Azusa Kai come out on top isn't good. If Ariga hadn't interfered. I'm so pissed. I don't want to preach, but if we give before Azusa Kai, they'll come on even stronger. Boss, Brother's right. Shoji, you're my only hope. It's cruel since you just came out of prison, but I want you to do it. You're right, Boss. What's with him? I'm leaving. Coming. Is Ryo here? I'm Nakagawa. Mr. Nakagawa? I'm Keiko. Ryo's... I mean, Sakai is out right now. I see. You're really cute. Am I? I'll tell Ryo you praised me. Oh, come in. I'll make some tea. Oh, don't bother. I was in the neighborhood. I'll come for a visit next time. Don't say that. Ryo will be angry. Never mind. Please. Brother, it's time to go. - Sister's going to scold again. - Idiot! I finally sneaked out. - Brother... - What? Nakagawa. Long time. I heard you were out. Kajiyama family is a gathering of good-for-nothings. What? I don't like your suit. Hey. I'm kidding. Celebrate your release. My treat. I thought you were the Azusa Kai acting chairman, but I hear it's Kanzaki. No unpleasantness on this auspicious night. Mama, give them your best table. This way. Let's dance. Bring the booze. Hurry up! Brother! Brother. Doctor! A doctor. Are you Mr. Nakagawa's family? He vomited blood again. What? My blood's the same, type B. Give him my blood. Yes, please. Ryo... How do you feel? Thanks. I'm costing you money again. Stop that. It's not like you. Now we're really blood brothers. You're loved. Everyone from the HQ underlings to the night club hostesses were here. Ryo, you're really a good person. There's no way that many people would be worried about me. I couldn't do anything for you either. You're wrong. The first time you came to me, you reminded me of myself. I became a yakuza at 26, too. I didn't tell anyone I tried my hand at many different business in Nagoya and... none of them panned out. So, your story was my story. But unlike me, you had the makings of a yakuza. So I was jealous. That's why I was hard on you. Forgive me. Brother! Ryo. Be good to Keiko. She's really a great person. Brother. Thank you for everything. He went to heaven by himself. I'm sure he's relieved. He was timid, yet stubborn and obstinate. He always tried to look bigger than he was. Bastard! Clashes among small fry won't cut it. We have to get the boss. This is our territory. Billiards is interesting. One wrong shot, everything goes haywire. Just like our conflict. I'm sorry what I did has lead to this. Nah. We're both trying to eke out a living here. There's no way we can keep out of each other's way. By the way, Ryo, I hear your woman comes from a normal family. Many her and make it legal. Uncle, at a time when we're in conflict with Kajiyama... The situation's not going to change. She fell in love knowing what you are. She must be prepared. You can't call yourself a real yakuza if you can't please even one woman. Really? Uncle Kanzaki said he'd take care of it, so decide on a place and date. I want to get married in a church. Ever since I was little, I dreamt of getting married in a church. So when? April 12th. The day you stood me up by the Hachiko statue. From today, I'll be Keiko Sakai. I like the name. Sure. Your father never answered you. I don't mind. I'm really going to be a yakuza wife. Sister. Congratulations, Ryo, Keiko. You're very beautiful. If only Nakagawa could have seen you now. Mrs. Akiyo. Wow. You look good. Brother. Thank you for coming. Uncle Ariga. Uncle Ariga and his wife. I was asked to be the witness at the last minute. She's worried I'll botch it. Sister, thank you for coming. You're very beautiful. Hey. Ryo. Congrats. What are you doing? Get off of me. Stay still. What? Only 50,000? An expensive wedding gift, but I guess it can't be helped. Here. Hold out your hand. Your hand. Here. It's a Philippine Colt 45. Isn't it grand? The Kajiyama family bought ten of these. They're going for all-out war. What the hell are you thinking? I have to make a living. Brother Kanzaki's late. The chairman's getting out of prison soon, so he's busy with preparations. Get the job done, Mashiba. You've never failed before. Everyone, please stand. Psalm 430. Not yet. Not enough practice. So follow me. Hey, I've seen him before. - What? - Take a good look. I know. Sorry, sorry. Ryo must be anxious. We now proceed to the exchange of rings. From husband to wife. From wife to husband. You may kiss the bride. Hey, Ryo. Looking good. Uncle. There's a car following us. Take that side street. Uncle! Uncle! Idiot! You good-for-nothing! How badly is he hurt? He's... I was hit, too, but this saved me. Brother. Brother! Don't tell anyone. I'll go alone. Got that? You hear? Brother. You look beautiful. Ryo is a happy man.
