WHAT ARE YOU PULLING? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. MARGARET NOT COMING TO THIS LUNCH? LUNCH? DO YOU... DO YOU KNOW... YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY? THIS LUNCH WILL BE ATTENDED THIS IS A VERY SAD DAY. BY EVERY MAJOR PUBLISHER IN THE UNIVERSE. MARGARET CAME EXPRESSLY... WE'RE SELLING THE SUBRIGHTS TO HER NEXT 3 NOVELS. TO GO TO THIS STUPID LUNCH. IF YOUR CLIENT DOESN'T SHOW-- LOOK, MARSHA, SHE'S JUST NOT FEELING VERY WELL. I DON'T CARE IF SHE'S GOT THE PLAGUE. I WANT HER AT THAT LUNCH. IF YOU THINK THAT SHE'S DUCKING THIS STUPID LUNCH BECAUSE SHE CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE CRITICISM FROM YOU, YOU'RE SERIOUSLY UNDERESTIMATING HER PROFESSIONALISM. AND MINE. I AM NOT QUESTIONING... I AM ACTING IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF MY CLIENTS. TELL THAT TO JONATHAN MATTHEWS. WHAT? SOMEONE'S BEEN SPREADING RUMOURS ABOUT GERMAN CORPORATIONS AND LOST PAINTINGS. WELL, IT SURE ISN'T ME. AND EVEN IF THAT INFORMATION WERE IN THE CHAPTERS YOU'RE HANDING OUT, I WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT, AND NEITHER WOULD THE OTHER BIDDERS, WHICH LEAVES JUST ONE PERSON WHO MIGHT BE SHOOTING HIS MOUTH OFF. IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT I EVEN HAVE THE TIME... I AM. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. IF YOU HAD ANY FEELINGS FOR JONATHAN, YOU'D CANCEL THIS BIDDING. YOU FINISHED? GOOD. I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH JONATHAN'S WIFE, WHERE MY "FEELINGS FOR JONATHAN" TAKE A BACK SEAT. AND I HAD A VERY BLEAK MORNING WITH GERMAN BUREAUCRACY TRYING TO ARRANGE A WAY TO GET HIS BODY ONTO A PLANE AND BACK TO HALIFAX IN TIME FOR A PROPER JEWISH BURIAL. NOW, MARSHA, IF YOU THINK THAT ON TOP OF DEALING WITH THE BEREAVEMENT OF HIS FAMILY AND MY OWN NOT INCONSID- ERABLE LOSS AND GRIEF... THAT I SOMEHOW HAVE GOT THE TIME TO FEED A RUMOUR MILL, WELL THEN, YOU'RE GIVING ME A LOT MORE CREDIT THAN I FEEL I DESERVE. MARTIN... HE WAS MY CLIENT AND MY FRIEND, MARSHA. AND AS FOR YOUR JUDGEMENT ABOUT THE CALLOUSNESS OF KEEPING THE BIDDING GOING, LET ME TELL YOU, SOMETHING, MARSHA, THAT TRYING IN MY OWN PATHETIC WAY TO KEEP BUSINESS GOING AS USUAL IS THE ONLY THING BETWEEN ME AND COMPLETE BREAKDOWN. [ Sigh ] I WANT MARGARET AT THAT LUNCH. INSPECTOR MURNAU? THANKS. NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO DISCOVER. YOU'RE NOT VERY QUICK, MISS CASS.

[ Chuckle ] BETTER NOT PUSH TOO FAR. HMM, IT'S FUNNY. I PICTURED JONATHAN WITH A DIFFERENT- LOOKING WIFE. YOU THINK SO? YEAH, IT'S ALWAYS A MYSTERY THOUGH, WHY TWO PEOPLE BECOME ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER. HMMM! YOU MARRIED? NO. I WAS. STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT BROUGHT MY EX-HUSBAND AND I TOGETHER. HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT CASS MEANS IN GERMAN? NO. IT'S LIKE IMPUDENT, OR STRAIGHTFORWARD. OH. YOU'RE ALWAYS CASS LIKE THIS? I LIKE THE DIRECT APPROACH. [ Clicking of shutter ] Judith: LOOKS LIKE A REMBRANDT. Murnau: MM-HMM. DON'T PUBLISH THIS UNLESS YOU CLEAR IT WITH ME FIRST. AND BY THE WAY, MISS CASS, GERMAN LAW REQUIRES THAT YOU TELL ME ANYTHING YOU FIND OUT. IS IT OKAY? YUP, SURE. HOW DO I GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU? OH. I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD. WELL, FRITZ, I THINK IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER IF WE WORKED TOGETHER. Marsha: I DON'T KNOW. DOES AMERICA NEED ANOTHER COFFEE TABLE BOOK ON THE DEPLETION OF THE RAINFOREST? I JUST DON'T KNOW. MR. MATTHEWS WAS 36 YEARS OLD. HE LEAVES BEHIND, UM... A WIFE AND TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. HE CAME TO FRANKFURT AT MY REQUEST IN ORDER TO HELP PROMOTE THE SALE OF HIS MANUSCRIPT, "WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN". THIS NEXT ONE IS, UM, HOW SHALL I PUT IT, MARGARET DAURIE CANTOR WITH A TWIST. A TWIST? IT'S THE FIRST ONE OF HER NOVELS NOT SET IN THE OLD SOUTH. AN AMERICAN WOMAN, RECENTLY DIVORCED, GOES ON SAFARI AND FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE TOUR GUIDE. THAT HAPPENS A LOT, THOUGH. TELL ME, WHAT ABOUT THIS BOOK ABOUT THE PAINTINGS? ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED TO TAKE BIDS. UM, ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? THERE'S SOME SPECULATION THAT MR. MATTHEWS WAS MURDERED OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK, WHICH APPARENTLY... COULD YOU... HOLD ON. JUST... EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND. I MEAN... [ Heavy sigh ] YOU'RE ASKING ME TO SPECULATE ON A SPECULATION. YOU'RE TOSSING AROUND A WORD LIKE MURDERED. I'D ASK YOU TO BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS, AND I ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT JONATHAN MATTHEWS' FAMILY. UH, ANY... ANYBODY ELSE? SAME PLACE. RIGHT HERE. OVER HERE, PLEASE. Marsha: I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED ANOTHER OVEN ROASTING COOKBOOK. WE HAVE QUITE A FEW OF THEM. I'VE BEEN DOING... I'VE BEEN RACKING MY BRAIN. I DON'T... I-I'LL DO ANYTHING. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO MARSHA HILLIER? I'M ABOUT TO SEE HER. WHY? WELL, IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING, BUT I DON'T KNOW, THERE'S A HISTORY THERE. THERE WAS A PERSONAL HISTORY. IN FACT, JONATHAN ASKED ME IF HE COULD SHOW HER CHAPTERS HIMSELF. CHAPTERS? YEAH, OF... "WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN". YOU SEE, THE WAY IT WORKS IN A BIDDING IS THAT THE PUBLISHERS GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SOME SAMPLE CHAPTERS. 20, 30 PAGES. IS IT UNUSUAL FOR THE AUTHOR TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH A PUBLISHER? IF IT HAPPENS TOO OFTEN, THEN I'D BE OUT OF A JOB. ANYWAY, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE... SAID SOMETHING TO HER. IT'S POSSIBLE. THEY DID HAVE A PERSONAL HISTORY, AND--I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO... I NEED TO GET TO... JUST A MOMENT. I'LL NEED A COPY OF THE BOOK. YEAH. YOU CAN HAVE A COPY AS SOON AS IT'S PUBLISHED. NO, NO. I MEAN, NOW. NOW? YEAH. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I MEAN, THE WAY THE BIDDING OPERATES... MR. BARRETT, I'VE GOT 3 DAYS LEFT TO SOLVE THE MURDER BEFORE ALL THE WITNESSES AND THE KILLER SCATTER AROUND THE WORLD. THERE'S A POLICE STATION IN HALL 12. LEAVE A MANUSCRIPT FOR ME THERE. UNDERSTAND? [ Sigh ] OH. MR. BARRETT. HI, FRITZ. HOW'S IT GOING? YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU REALLY HAVE TO CUT DOWN ON THOSE CANCER STICKS. MY UNCLE, HE QUIT COLD TURKEY. IT JUST WORKED WONDERS. THAT'S A FUNNY EXPRESSION, ISN'T IT? "COLD TURKEY". I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A TURKEY SMOKE? I'VE HAD SMOKED TURKEY BEFORE... HOW MUCH OF OUR CONVERSATION DID YOU HEAR? CONVER... FRITZ, WHAT KIND OF PERSON DO YOU TAKE ME FOR? EXCUSE ME. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? YOU KNOW IT. I'M GOING TO SEE YOUR FRIEND. NO, TOO LATE. YOU SAID 1:00 P.M. SHARP. SHE'S NOW AT A LUNCH WITH ONE OF HER, UH... AUTHORS. [ In German ] OH, GODDAMMIT! [ In English ] OH, I LIKE THAT! LET'S TEACH EACH OTHER HOW TO SWEAR IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. OH, DON'T SULK. I'LL SET UP ANOTHER MEETING FOR YOU AND MARSHA. [ Ringing of cell phone ] I'LL SET UP MY OWN MEETINGS. OKAY. Marsha: LINDA... [ In German ] EXCUSE ME, PLEASE. [ In English ] IF A RUDE, TOBACCO-STAINED POLICEMAN ARRIVES, WOULD YOU TELL HIM I WAITED AS LONG AS I COULD? YES. I HAVE TO TALK WITH YOU. THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK WITH ME. ...SO THEN, BARRETT TOLD MURNAU ABOUT YOU AND JONATHAN. WHAT DID HE SAY? THAT IT WAS PERSONAL, AND THAT MAYBE JONATHAN TOLD YOU SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HELP WITH THE INVESTIGATION. [ Sigh ] DID HE? WHAT? COME ON. YOU CAN TELL ME. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU... LOOK, MARSHA, I CAME OVER HERE TO DO A PIECE ON JONATHAN MATTHEWS, A NICE LITTLE PUFF PIECE ABOUT A NICE LITTLE CANADIAN THAT'D GET ME A COUPLE GRAND, AND MAYBE THE HELL OFF THE HUMAN INTEREST BEAT. WELL, NOW IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. SOMETHING THAT COULD GET MY NAME AROUND IF I DO IT RIGHT, EXCEPT THERE'S A HUNDRED OTHER DOGS SNIFFING AROUND, TRYING TO MAKE THEIR OWN NAMES. NOW, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, THIS IS A STORY AND YOU CAN HELP ME TELL IT. I'M NOT GOING TO HELP ANYONE DIG INTO THAT MAN'S FLESH. NOT ANYBODY. OH, I SEE. SO NOW I'M EXPLOITING HIM. I COULDN'T HAVE PUT IT BETTER MYSELF. AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING BY BIDDING ON HIS BOOK? I'M TRYING TO SAVE MY JOB! RIGHT! AND I'M TRYING TO DO MINE. ALL I'VE GOT IS ONE DEAD WRITER, A BUNCH OF RUMOURS AND SOME TENUOUS CONNECTION TO A BIG REMBRANDT PAINTING. YOU KNOW, THIS ONE... BLECH! IT'S ALL PART OF THE GOSSIP, IS IT? NO. IT'S JUST RESEARCH. WHY? AM I ON TO SOMETHING? FOLLOW YOUR NOSE. OH, I LOVE YOU. HELLO, MY DEAR. PETER. THE CAR WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT. UM, PETER FREIMANN, THIS IS JUDITH CASS. YES, YOU SPILLED A DRINK OVER ME LAST NIGHT. NO, NO, NO, THAT WAS MY SISTER. AH. JUDITH IS AN OLD FRIEND FROM CANADA. PETER IS THE PRESIDENT OF FREIMANN VERLAG. RIGHT. A BIG GERMAN CORPORATION. BIGGER THAN SOME, SMALLER THAN OTHERS. BUT THERE'S SOME PRETTY HOT RUMOURS GOING AROUND ABOUT LOST PAINTINGS AND GERMAN CORPORATIONS. YES. I'VE HEARD OF THIS RUBBISH. NOTHING THAT WOULD AFFECT YOUR COMPANY, I'M SURE. MISS CASS, EVERY GERMAN COMPANY THAT CAME INTO EXISTENCE BEFORE THE WAR HAS HAD TO CLEAR ITS NAME. JUDITH... THE ANSWER IS YES. YOU'RE NOT INTER- ESTED IN BIDDING ON THE MATTHEWS BOOK BY ANY CHANCE, ARE YOU? WE WOULD, BUT, UH, WE HAVE A BOOK ON THE SAME SUBJECT. THIS IS THE AUTHOR OVER THERE. RICHARD SCHMIDT, A FELLOW CANADIAN, FROM HALIFAX. HE CAN ANSWER THE REST OF YOUR QUESTIONS. MY BEST TO YOUR SISTER. YES, I'LL TELL HER YOU SAID HI. [ ♪♪♪ ] [ ♪♪♪ ] FOLLOW THAT CAB. I MEAN IT! ARE YOU A COP? DO I LOOK LIKE A COP? NO, YOU LOOK LIKE A REPORTER. DRIVE. [ In German ] NOW! [ ♪♪♪ ] ONE O'CLOCK SHARP. MISS HILLIER, I COULDN'T MAKE IT. I HAVE TO GET INSIDE. IF I HAVE TO TAKE YOU IN, I WILL. NOW LISTEN, MAN, WOULD YOU PLEASE... IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE RIGHT IN. MR. MATTHEWS DELIVERED HIS MANUSCRIPT TO YOU PERSONALLY. THAT'S RIGHT. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WAS? I TOLD YOU. I'D MET HIM ONCE. THEREFORE YOU HAD A PRIOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM. WHICH I TOLD YOU ABOUT. NOT IN GREAT DETAIL. IT BEGAN AND ENDED AT THE WRITERS' RETREAT. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE IT? WE WERE FRIENDS. DID YOU GO TO BED TOGETHER? LOOK... DID HE SAY ANYTHING WHEN HE GAVE YOU THE MANUSCRIPT? HE STARTED TO. HE SEEMED NERVOUS ABOUT PUBLISHING IT. WHY? HE DIDN'T SAY. MISS HILLIER, PLEASE! HE DIDN'T SAY. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ANY OF THIS WHEN I CAME TO YOUR ROOM THIS MORNING? THIS MORNING, I BARELY REMEMBER THIS MORNING. MISS HILLIER, I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT... A MAN I KNEW DIED, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, AND THE WHOLE THING'S BECOME GRIST FOR THE RUMOUR MILL. NO ONE SAID A WORD ABOUT JONATHAN. NO ONE'S STOPPED TO SAY ONE KIND THING. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE AFTER HERE, INSPECTOR, BUT I DON'T DESERVE BEING STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND ASKED A LOT OF PRYING QUESTIONS. IF YOU THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN JONATHAN AND I THAT SOMEHOW LED TO HIS DEATH... YOU'RE WRONG. I DON'T THINK THAT, MISS HILLIER. BUT I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT YOU DO. UM, EVERYBODY IS WAITING FOR YOU. YES. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. PLEASE, ENJOY YOUR LUNCH, MISS HILLIER. THANK YOU. Helga: THIS IS INCREDIBLE. IF A BOMB WENT OFF IN THIS ROOM, THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING BUSINESS WOULD HAVE TO START OVER. WHERE SHOULD WE PLANT IT? DISGUSTING. ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE IN HONOUR OF A WOMAN WHO WRITES SUCH TRIPE. Jerry: NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW. MAINSTAY OF THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING DIET. WHERE'S THE CRAZY BIRD ANYWAY? Helga: OH, SHE'LL BE HERE, MISS SOUTHERN BELLE. SHE KNOWS HOW TO WORK A ROOM. [ In Japanese ] KONICHIWA. KONICHIWA. WHEN WILL I HAVE THE HONOUR OF SEEING MISS MARGARET DAURIE CANTOR? WELL, JUST AS SOON AS SHE GETS HERE. I KNOW SHE'S REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING WITH YOU. SHE IS ONE OF JAPAN'S BIGGEST SELLERS. I HAVE HER PICTURE ON MY TABLE. [ Laughing ] REALLY? WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME? OKAY. EXCUSE ME. [ ♪♪♪ ] [ ♪♪♪ ] SO, WHY THIS PAINTING OVER ALL THE OTHER ONES? YOU WALKED STRAIGHT THROUGH THIS ROOM RIGHT UP TO THIS ONE. I WATCHED YOU. YOU'RE CANADIAN? YEAH! I'M FROM HALIFAX. OH, YES. YES, I... I GREW UP THERE. AH! WHY THIS PAINTING? WHY DO YOU ASK? WELL, IT USED TO MEAN A LOT TO SOMEONE. HE'S DEAD NOW. THIS IS SO WEIRD. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I'D BE IN A BUILDING HALFWAY ACROSS THE... OH! I'M, I'M JUDITH CASS. OH, RICHARD SCHMIDT. NOT THE RICHARD SCHMIDT? YES, I... I... OH, MY GOD! THIS IS CRAZY! I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU. I'M WITH THE HALIFAX "CHRONICLE HERALD", DOING A STORY ON JONATHAN MATTHEWS. WELL, I MEAN, I WAS. WELL, I STILL AM. IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW, IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY NOW. [clicks tongue and sighs] YES. WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO CALL ME ABOUT? WELL, UH, I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR PUBLISHER THAT YOUR BOOK AND JONATHAN'S ARE BOTH ABOUT, UH, STOLEN PAINTINGS. YES. IS THAT RIGHT? UH, UM... OF COURSE I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MY BOOK. OH, OF COURSE. I'M AN ART HISTORIAN. I TRACE THE PROVENANCE OF UH, PAINTINGS STOLEN FROM JEWISH FAMILIES BY THE NAZIS. OH... I ALSO ATTEMPT TO RETURN THOSE PAINTINGS TO THEIR ORIGINAL OWNERS, WHERE POSSIBLE. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, "WHERE POSSIBLE". TELL ME, UM... "PROVENANCE", WHAT IS THAT? UM, JUST A FANCY WORD FOR WHO OWNED IT, AND WHEN. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, MR. MATTHEWS' BOOK DEALS WITH THIS SUBJECT IN A MINOR, ALMOST GLANCING, WAY. YEAH, BUT APPARENTLY THIS REMBRANDT PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN HIS BOOK. YOU WOULDN'T, BY ANY CHANCE, KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ITS... PROVENANCE, WOULD YOU? Cowboy: SEE NOW, BY OUR CALCULATIONS, ABOUT $8 MILLION IN SALES JUST WALKED OUT OF THE LUNCH. ASK NOT FOR WHOM THE SOUTHERN BELLE TOLLS, MISS HILLIER. SHE TOLLS FOR THEE. Schmidt: PAINTINGS AT THIS TIME WERE MOSTLY COMMISSIONED WORK. FOR THIS ONE, REMBRANDT WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN CLEAR SPECIFICATIONS FOR HIS COMPOSITION: 6 MEN, 1 WOMAN. Judith: IT'S SO CRUEL, HMMM? I MEAN, A DAGGER STRAIGHT THROUGH THE EYE? BLAH! I TAKE IT WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE OWNER IS? UM... THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT. JUST CRAWLED INTO THE MUSEUM ONE NIGHT AND HUNG ITSELF UP ON THE WALL, DID IT? THERE ARE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PAINTINGS WHOSE... WHOSE HISTORIES ARE POORLY DOCUMENTED, IF AT ALL. WELL, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT JONATHAN FOUND THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS ONE? IT... IT'S, UM... POSSIBLE. AFTER THE WAR, UH, VARIOUS PAINTINGS STARTED TO POP UP UH, THAT NO ONE KNEW ABOUT BEFORE. NO RECORD COULD BE FOUND, THEY WEREN'T LISTED ANYWHERE, YOU KNOW... AND, UH... ONE BY ONE, A HUGE COLLECTION OF PAINTINGS, MASTERPIECES, APPEARED; PAINTINGS THAT HAD NEVER BEEN EXHIBITED, AS IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN SECRETLY COLLECTING THEM THROUGH THE AGES. YOU KNOW, REMBRANDTS, BOTTICELLIS, DURERS, MONETS... SO JONATHAN COULD HAVE HIT ON SOME RATHER EMBARRASSING INFORMATION? EM-EMBARRASSING? WELL, YEAH. I MEAN LOOK, TAKE THE FREIMANNS. THEY ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST MEDIA CONCERNS IN THE WORLD. I MEAN, IF IT EVER CAME OUT THAT A PAINTING, OR PAINTINGS, OF THEIRS WAS ONCE CONFIS- CATED ON ORDERS OF THE FUHRER... REALLY, MISS CASS, THAT'S QUITE A... A CONCLUSION. MY LINE OF WORK IS ALL ABOUT JUMPING TO FAST CONCLUSIONS. MINE IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. WELL, STILL, THE ENTIRE FREIMANN EMPIRE COULD HAVE BEEN FORGED ON A STOLEN PAINTING RACKET. WELL, NOW YOU'RE BEING A... A LITTLE RIDICULOUS. AM I? YEAH! HOW... HOW DO WE... OR MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO REVEAL CERTAIN FACTS ABOUT YOUR CURRENT PUBLISHER. OR I'M WRONG. IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME? I-I REALLY DON'T KNOW... SEE, I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT AT THE PARTY, WITH JONATHAN. YOU WERE HAVING QUITE AN ARGUMENT. MISS CASS, I'VE BEEN VERY GENEROUS WITH MY TIME, BUT IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M DUE BACK AT THE FAIR. MY BOOK IS HAVING ITS OFFICIAL SEND-OFF. CONGRATULATIONS. [ Opening of door ] DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'VE DONE? UH, SOMETHING GROTESQUE, I'M SURE. DO YOU REALIZE EVERY CONVERSATION THAT YOU START WITH ME, YOU START BY INDICTING ME? IS SHE STILL IN FRANKFURT? OR HAVE YOU MAILED HER BACK TO GEORGIA? ACTUALLY, MARSHA, I'VE HAD HER KIDNAPPED BY GERMAN SKINHEAD BIKERS, AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO SHARE IN THE RANSOM WITH WHICHEVER PUBLISHER WANTS HER BACK THE MOST. MARTIN, I'M GOING TO SEE HER IMMEDIATELY. BECAUSE IF I DON'T, 2 THINGS WILL HAPPEN: ONE: WE'LL CANCEL THE REST OF THE CONTRACT RIGHT NOW AND TWO: I'LL PULL OUT OF THE "WHEREABOUTS" BIDDING. AH, AH, AH. MUSTN'T BLUFF A BLUFFER. I HEAR YOUR COWBOY FRIENDS WANT THIS BOOK VERY BADLY. MY COWBOY ASSO- CIATES DON'T MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. THEY MAY SIGN THE CHEQUES, BUT I WRITE THEM. NOW, IF YOU THINK THAT'S A BLUFF, CALL IT. IF YOU DON'T, CALL YOUR CLIENT. JUST FOR THE RECORD, I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU'RE NOT FRIGHTENING ME INTO DOING THE RIGHT THING HERE. I HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY TRYING WITH MARGARET. IT'S JUST THAT SHE IS A VERY... SHE'S NOT WELL, AND IF I-- MARGARET, IT'S, UM... MARTIN. I'M SORRY, I KNOW I DID, BUT I'VE GOT MARSHA HERE AND SHE WANTS TO TALK... MARSHA HILLIER... UM, SHE, SHE WANTS TO TALK TO... I DO THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA. NO, DARLING. I THINK PERHAPS EARLIER ON THE OTHER... ON THIS SIDE OF THE OCEAN WOULD BE... BETTER. UM... 6:00 O'CLOCK IN YOUR ROOM? 7:00 O'CLOCK? THEN FINE, 7:00 O'CLOCK. I THANK YOU. AND I'M SORRY ABOUT... THANKS, BYE-BYE. MR. BARRETT? YEAH. UH, THIS IS A LITTLE SHORT FOR A NOVEL, AND, UM, I'M NOT TAKING ON NEW CLIENTS RIGHT NOW. IT'S A COURT ORDER, MR. BARRETT, WHICH REQUIRES THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY TURN OVER THE MANUSCRIPT OF "WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN" TO ME. IMMEDIATELY? WELL, I, I CAN'T JUMP THAT HIGH. NOT EVEN FOR A GERMAN COURT. THE MANUSCRIPT'S IN A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX IN NEW YORK, AND ALL I'VE GOT IS A FEW SAMPLE CHAPTERS. HAVE AN ASSOCIATE E-MAIL IT TO YOU. YOU FORGOT TO SAY "IMMEDIATELY". IT ISN'T A JOKE, MR. BARRETT. FIND A QUICK WAY TO GET ME THE MANUSCRIPT. HERE'S MY CARD. BYE. Schmidt: YES, WE MET BEFORE. HE CONSULTED ME ON HIS... ON HIS BOOK. WHAT DID HE WANT TO KNOW? INFORMATION ON STOLEN ART, IN GENERAL. UH, HIS BOOK'S ON A RELATED SUBJECT. Murnau: MM-HMM. DID YOU READ IT? HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ON A RELATED SUBJECT? HE TOLD ME SO. UH-HUH. YOU'RE NOT A GOOD LIAR, MR. ART DETECTIVE. THE MEETING IN THE HOTEL, WHAT WAS IT TO BE ABOUT? UM, I DON'T KNOW. HE... HE CALLED ME, SO I... YOU KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WANTED? I... I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA. I... Freimann: RICHARD. SOME PEOPLE TO MEET YOU. BUT I... [ In German ] I TAKE IT YOU HAVE FINISHED WITH MR. SCHMIDT? [ In German ] FOR NOW. [ In English ] GO AHEAD. HI, FRITZ. OH. WHAT'D YOU GET FROM SCHMIDT? OOH! HE'S CAGEY, AIN'T HE? YOU SPOKE WITH HIM? I TRIED TO. I THINK HE'S HIDING SOMETHING. UH-HUH. THE REMBRANDT IS HERE IN THE MUSEUM. YEAH, IT MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH OUR CASE, HUH? DID YOU SEE THE NOTATION "SCHMIDT"? AW, GIVE ME A BREAK. I SAW HIM. HE WAS HAVING AN ARGUMENT WITH JONATHAN AT THE PARTY. AT THE PARTY? YEAH. WHAT ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO HEAR. LOOK, FRITZ, WE'RE BOTH CHASING THE SAME TAIL HERE. WHY NOT INSTEAD OF RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES WE JUST GIVE EACH OTHER A LITTLE DIRECTION, HUH? AHH... I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID. AH, I THINK YOU DO. LOOK, LET'S GET TOGETHER LATER, HAVE A COUPLE OF DRINKS, AND COMPARE NOTES. WHAT'DYA SAY? I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING: "CRAZY AMERICAN". BUT YOU'RE WRONG. I'M CANADIAN, BY JEEZE! [ Rapping on door ] [ Opening of door ] HI. HI. NO MORE DEALS AND MEETINGS? NO, I'M WAITING TO HEAR FROM BARRETT. HE'S PROMISED ME AN AUDIENCE WITH MARGARET. DO YOU WANT A DRINK? YEAH, I'D LOVE ONE. I HAVE A BIG DECISION TO MAKE, JUDE. DID YOU JUST... I'M SORRY... SORRY? YOU JUST CALLED ME JUDE. DID I? YEAH. I DIDN'T REALIZE. YOU ALWAYS CALL ME JUDE IF YOU'RE DRUNK, OR ABOUT TO CONFIDE IN ME. WELL, DON'T THOSE TWO THINGS USUALLY GO TOGETHER? [ Chuckle ] SO, WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN BID ON THIS BOOK. WHY NOT? BECAUSE JONATHAN HAD HIS DOUBTS ABOUT PUBLISHING. HE TOLD YOU THAT. MMM-HMM. AT THE PARTY, JUST BEFORE HE COLLAPSED, HE SAID, "DON'T READ IT. NO ONE SHOULD READ IT." SUPPOSE HE WAS KILLED OVER THIS BOOK? I MEAN, FROM WHAT I'VE READ, I... TELL ME. I CAN'T AND YOU KNOW IT. OH, WELL KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. I OWE IT TO HIM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU OWE IT TO HIM? I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM. I WAS REALLY IN LOVE WITH HIM. [ Clicks tongue ] IT WAS A WEEK, 8 YEARS AGO. YOU WERE STILL WITH PHILIP. NOT FOR MUCH LONGER. ANYWAY, I ONLY SAW JONATHAN ONCE AFTER THE RETREAT. HE CAME TO NEW YORK. WE HAD LUNCH IN A RESTAURANT. HE SHOWED ME PICTURES OF HIS WIFE. OH, GOD. SO, WE HAD A COFFEE AND TALKED. HE WAS LOOKING FOR AN AGENT, SO I PUT HIM ONTO MARTIN BARRETT. WELL, THAT'S ONE MEASURE OF REVENGE, HUH? FOR HIS GETTING MARRIED? HE WANTED THE BEST, SO I PUT HIM ONTO THE BEST. MARSHA, I HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK, BUT IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE PUBLIC. I MEAN, THAT IS WHAT YOU OWE. AND JONATHAN'S DOUBTS? I DON'T KNOW. [ Ringing of telephone ] I CAN'T ANSWER TO THOSE. YES? WHY NOT, MARTIN? YES, WELL, YEAH, I KNOW SHE'S NOT FEELING WELL, BUT SHE'D HAD ENOUGH T... MARTIN, I-- BARRETT SAYS IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO MEET WITH MARGARET. ALL RIGHT. WHAT ROOM IS SHE IN? WELL, HOW WOULD I KNOW? THAT'S MARTIN'S LITTLE SECRET. I WILL FIND OUT FOR YOU, IF... IF? YOU'LL LET ME COME WITH. [ ♪♪♪ ] [ Chiming of church bell ] HMM. MOVE OVER. I'M FROM THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS. Woman: YES? IT'S MARSHA. Woman: HOLD ON A MINUTE. OH, SHUT THE DOOR. QUICKLY, QUICKLY. UM, THIS IS MY FRIEND, JUDITH CASS. MARGARET DAURIE CANTOR. PLEASURE. HOW ARE YOU? Margaret: PLEASE DO NOT BERATE ME, MY CHILD. IF I HAVE OFFENDED YOU, I DO APOLOGIZE. AS YOU CAN SEE, MY CONDITION... MY CONDITION... YES. YES, OF COURSE. HAND ME SOME WATER, WOULD YOU, CHILD? THAT'S ENOUGH. THANK YOU. [ ♪♪♪ ] [ ♪♪♪ ] NOW, MY DEAR, YOU MUST COME OUT WITH IT. YOU MUST SAY TO MY FACE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING TO MY AGENT. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN BEAR TO HEAR IT, BUT I MUST. I-I KNOW I MUST. FIRST, HAND ME THE BOTTLE THERE. WHICH ONE? THIRD... FROM THE LEFT. MARTIN USUALLY GETS THEM FOR ME AT THE APPOINTED HOURS, BUT I... I FEEL THE NEED FOR ONE NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MARTIN'S BEEN SAYING TO YOU, BUT WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S PROBABLY AS FAR FROM THE TRUTH AS WE ARE FROM HOME. THE FACT IS I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHA... AH! CONCERNS! THERE LIES THE DAGGER. MARGARET... WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS WORLD? WHERE ARE THE GENTLE PEOPLE? I AM SO FRAGILE, MY DEAR. I NEED SYMPATHY. HOW ABOUT TOSSING ME THE FLASK? OH... THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE YOU SURE THOSE TWO GO TOGETHER? SUCH A CARING CHILD. MARSHA, MARSHA. I KNOW I'VE LET YOU DOWN. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YOU TODAY, BUT I... I JUST COULD NOT FACE A ROOMFUL OF STRANGERS. MARGARET, I CANNOT PROMOTE THE BOOK WITHOUT YOU. AH! I NEED YOU. PEOPLE LOVE YOU, MARGARET. THAT IS THE REALITY. THE SAD REALITY, MY DEAR. LOOK, HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WHAT? WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE COCKTAIL SESSION AT THE BOOTH TOMORROW. MMM. YOU COULD COPE WITH THAT, COULDN'T YOU? I'LL TRY, MY DEAR. AND THERE'S JUST ONE OTHER THING. WHAT? ARE THERE ANY NEW CHAPTERS? [ Sigh ] OF COURSE. THERE, ON THE DESK. TAKE WHAT'S... THERE. TAKE MY BURNT OFFERINGS. MARSHA. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO KIND TO ME. ALWAYS. OOH, THAT LADY'S SLIGHTLY CRACKED. THANK GOD WE'RE NOT FAMOUS, HUH? Murnau: SO MR. JONATHAN MATTHEWS FOUND OUT THE FREIMANNS ARE IMPLICATED IN THE THEFT OF A PAINTING? RIGHT. OKAY. TELL ME. WHAT'S YOUR THEORY? OKAY. THE FREIMANNS ARE TRYING TO BUILD A GLOBAL EMPIRE, LIKE BERTELSMANN OR TIME-WARNER. I MEAN, THEY'VE ALREADY WON THE PUBLIC RELATIONS BATTLE OVER WHETHER OR NOT THEY OWE RESTITUTION ON THE JEWISH PUBLISHING HOUSES THEY MORE OR LESS STOLE FROM BEFORE THE WAR, BUT WHAT THEY WEREN'T COUNTING ON WAS THIS SUDDEN WORLDWIDE INTEREST IN RECOVERING STOLEN PROPERTY. YOU'VE JUST CONTRADICTED YOURSELF. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I MEAN, IF IT EVER CAME OUT THAT FREIMANN HAD A HAND IN STOLEN ART, THEIR REPUTATION WOULD BE DESTROYED. BYE-BYE EMPIRE. SO WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY HIRE ACE SCHMIDT, ART DETECTIVE, TO TRY AND CONVINCE JONATHAN NOT TO PUBLISH HIS FINDINGS. YES. OF COURSE. AND WHEN JONATHAN REFUSES, MR. FREIMANN, OR MR. SCHMIDT, SLIPS A DOSE OF LIQUID NICOTINE INTO HIS DRINK AT THE PARTY. THAT'S BRIL- LIANT, HMMM? OH! NOW I GET IT. YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME. OH, NEVER THAT, MISS CASS. BUT IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I'VE GOT SOME TRIVIAL POLICE WORK TO LOOK AFTER. THE AGENT OF MR. MATTHEWS HAS FINALLY SECURED A COPY OF THE MANUSCRIPT. HE HAS IT WAITING FOR ME AT THE HOTEL ROOM. DO YOU MIND IF I TAG ALONG? AS A MATTER OF... THANKS, FRITZ. [ In German ] CHEQUE, PLEASE. YES, LINDA. I'M ON MY WAY. MISS HILLIER. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN 10. [phone beeps] WE BEEN LOOKIN' ALL OVER FOR YOU. GENTLEMEN. SORRY, BUT WE DECIDED NOT TO WAIT FOR YOUR ANALYSIS ON THE DAURIE CANTOR CONTRACT. WE WENT OUT AND GOT ONE OF OUR OWN. WE ARE IN THE RIGHT HERE, MISS HILLIER, AND WE ARE GOING TO CANCEL THE REST OF THE CONTRACT. FURTHERMORE, WE'VE TOLD MISS CANTOR'S AGENT TO DRAW UP THE PAPERS. YOU DID WHAT? WE TOLD YOU, WE HAD TO CAP THE WELL. NOW, WE WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE ON SIDE. I AM NOT. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! WELL, NOW, NOW, NOW, HOLD ON NOW! YOU ASKED ME TO DEAL WITH THIS, AND I AM, IN MY WAY. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH IT IN YOUR WAY, YOU DON'T NEED ME. I WISH YOU LUCK, GENTLEMEN. YOU HAVE MEETINGS TOMORROW STARTING AT 8:00 A.M. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HOLD ON A SECOND. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE BIDDING ON "WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN". HAVE EITHER OF YOU EVER ACTUALLY BID ON A BOOK BEFORE? PROBABLY NOT. OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE THINKING ABOUT CANCELLING A CONTRACT WITH THE SAME AGENT YOU'RE SO DESPERATE TO GET A PROPERTY FROM. NOW, MISS HILLIER, WE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT HAVING TO HAVE YOU CANCEL-- YOU SAID EVERYTHING YOU NEEDED TO WHEN YOU SPOKE TO MARTIN BARRETT. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE? STARTING WITH THIS: YOU HAVE TOTALLY UNDERMINED ME IN THIS BUSINESS. YES, ME, AND THE COMPANY. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'VE JUST ENSURED THAT LIST PUBLISHING BE TREATED AS A PARIAH. IS THAT RIGHT? WHEN WORD GETS OUT THAT YOU'VE CANCELLED MARGARET DAURIE CANTOR'S CONTRACT, A CHILL WILL GO THROUGH THIS INDUSTRY. YOU WILL NEVER SIGN A TOP WRITER AGAIN. NEVER. SO PLEASE, DO ME A FAVOUR: FIRE ME. [ Ringing of cell phone ] HELLO? MARTIN. YES. YES, OF COURSE. YES. YES. WHICH ROOM ARE YOU IN? YOU MISSED YOUR CALLING, MISS CASS. JUDITH. MY NAME IS JUDITH. OKAY. YUDIT. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. J...

I'M THE POLICEMAN. YOU'RE LUCKY HE IS ALIVE. I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOUR FRIEND. YEAH, I JUST... JUST... ALONE, PLEASE. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE ROOM, OKAY? SO IS THIS THE MOMENT WHEN YOU BEAT THE CONFESSION OUT OF ME? I WASN'T PLANNING ON IT. UM, IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO CONFESS... YOU SEEM TO THINK YOU ARE A SUSPECT IN ALL THIS. YOU SEEM TO BE SUSPECTING ME. WELL, YOU WERE AT BOTH CRIME SCENES, BUT I'VE GOT ANOTHER THOUGHT ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE LESS A LIKELY SUSPECT THAN A LIKELY VICTIM. TWO PEOPLE CONNECTED WITH THE MANUSCRIPT HAVE BEEN POISONED. ONE IS DEAD, THE OTHER ALMOST. YOU BIDDING ON THE BOOK, AND THE BIDDING WILL HAPPEN IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS. YOU THINK I SHOULDN'T BID? THAT MIGHT BE PRUDENT. WHEN MR. BARRETT IS ABLE TO SPEAK, I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT HE PUT OFF THE BID. Judith: AH! IT IS 9:00 O'CLOCK IN HALIFAX. I MEAN, HE SHOULD BE HOME BY NOW. [ Chuckle ] I KNOW, I'M A MOM, SO SHUT UP. ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I, UM, I LIKE THIS SIDE, SO SHOVE A BUM. WHAT? I'M STAYING OVER. DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. WHAT DID MURNAU TELL YOU? WELL, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO, PUT POISON IN THE TOOTHPASTE? I'M STAYING. PUT IT DOWN. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING TO SEND YOU TO SLEEP, TRY THE NEW CHAPTERS FROM DAURIE CANTOR. REALLY?

HE SEEMS TO BE AS FAMOUS FOR HIS CLIENTS AS HE IS FOR... HOW WOULD YOU SAY IT? UH... "RIPPING THEM OFF?" THERE HAVE BEEN RUMOURS AROUND ABOUT MARTIN BARRETT SINCE THE DAY HE POPPED OUT OF THE WOMB. SUCH AS? OH, HE'S A THIEF, A CROOK, AND A SHOWMAN. YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW WHICH BANK HE DEALS WITH? HE DEALS WITH LOTS OF BANKS. HMM. SOME OF THEM EVEN LEGITIMATE. WHICH ONE, PRIMARILY?

SOMEBODY TRIES TO STOP ME FROM DOING SOMETHING, I JUST WANT TO DO IT ALL THE MORE. HAVE YOU SEEN MARGARET? SHE'S NOT WELL. YOU MUST KNOW THAT. Well, all I do know is that my concern for her FORCES ME TO TAKE HER BY THE HAND AND PUT HER ON A PLANE TONIGHT. I've just opened up the bidding, And it's all going to be decided by tonight. TONIGHT? Yeah. I've had a lot of interest from publishers in the last 24 hours, including Freimann. NOW MARSHA, FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE, I'VE SENT YOU THE LAST CHAPTERS. DON'T LET THAT GET AROUND. IT'S GOING TO PUT A STOP TO ALL THESE RUMOURS, AND IT WILL GO OFF LIKE A BOMB. Martin, you can't just... LOOK, I'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

AND SO THEY COLLECTED ART FOR GENERATIONS? YAH, YAH. FIRST WAS DAVID REBBER, 1477. YEAH. HE COMMISSIONED A PAINTING IN FLORENCE. A BOTTICELLI. BUT MY FAVOURITE WAS A REMBRANDT. ELIAS REBBER BROUGHT IT OVER FROM AMSTERDAM. AND SO THERE WAS A SECRET GALLERY, ONLY KNOWN ABOUT BY THE REBBER FAMILY MEMBERS? YES. YAH. AND IT COULD HAVE REMAINED A SECRET. EXCEPT FOR HITLER. HITLER. YAH. I KEPT URGING FATHER HENRY TO FLEE. HE COULD HAVE EASILY BOUGHT HIS PASSAGE OUT OF THE COUNTRY. FOR HIMSELF, FOR HIS ENTIRE FAMILY. BUT HE REFUSED. "THIS IS MY COUNTRY, SON. MY COUNTRY. "MY FATHERS AND FOREFATHERS WERE HERE SINCE A THOUSAND YEARS." ONE NIGHT, WE WERE WORKING LATE. FATHER HENRY MUST HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING. HE ASKED ME TO TAKE HIS PAINTINGS, THE WHOLE COLLECTION. I TOOK THEM. ONE BY ONE I BROUGHT THEM TO MY HOUSE. I STORED THE TREASURE IN THE BASEMENT. A FEW NIGHTS LATER, I REMEMBER, I WAS THERE. FEBRUARY 22nd, 1941, THE GESTAPO CAME. THE WHOLE REBBER FAMILY WAS SITTING THERE, WAITING FOR THEM. NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN. SILENTLY THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY IN AN ARMY TRUCK. FIRST TO THERESIENSTADT, AND THEN TO AUSCHWITZ. NONE SURVIVED. AFTER THE WAR, I BROUGHT THE COLLECTION TO CANADA. FIRST A DRAWING. I SOLD IT WITH THE HELP OF AN ENGLISH ART DEALER. I HAD A YOUNG FAMILY TO SUPPORT. AND THEN, WHEN THE MONEY WAS GONE, I... I SOLD SOME OF THE OTHER PAINTINGS. ONE BY ONE THEY DISAPPEARED, YOU KNOW. WHAT ABOUT YOUR SON? DOES HE KNOW YOUR STORY? RICHARD THE IDEALIST. HE SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE LOOKING FOR STOLEN ART, TO RETURN IT TO THE SURVIVORS. LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT HIS OWN FATHER WAS THE BIGGEST THIEF OF ALL. AND WHEN HE FOUND OUT, HE FORCED ME TO DONATE THE REST OF THE COLLECTION, ALL THE REST OF THE PAINTINGS TO FRANKFURT, THE CITY OF THE REBBERS. SO I... I MADE AN ANONYMOUS DONATION. ALL THE OWNERS WERE GONE. GONE! HEY, RICHARD SCHMIDT! I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. WE HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. OH, I THINK WE DO. YOUR FATHER EMI- GRATED TO CANADA AFTER THE WAR, BRINGING WITH HIM A SECRET COLLECTION OF PAINTINGS OF UNTHINKABLE VALUE. A COLLECTION BUILT OVER GENERATIONS. YOU'VE READ THE BOOK. YOUR FATHER TURNED INTO CASH ONE OF THE BIGGEST PATRIMONIES OF CULTURAL HISTORY TO START HIS OWN BUSINESS. THE NAZIS DESTROYED THE REBBERS; YOU DESTROYED THEIR LEGACY FOREVER. I KNEW IF MY FATHER TALKED TO JONATHAN, HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS SECRET. HE'S TOO OLD, HE'S TOO GUILTY. THANK GOD HE HAS A CONSCIENCE. JONATHAN WANTED... NO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BOOK CAN MEAN. I MEAN, JONATHAN REVEALED A WAY OF LIFE, A CULTURE, YOU KNOW, A WISDOM. I MEAN THESE PEOPLE HAD ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WE'RE ALL ASKING. YOUR POINT IS WHAT? MY POINT... IS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO STOP THIS BOOK FROM BEING PUBLISHED TO PROTECT YOUR FATHER AND YOUR OWN DAMNED REPUTATION. JONATHAN... AND YOU WOULD DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THAT REPUTATION. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT. MY GOD! DON'T TELL ME YOU THINK THAT I-- YES, I DO. AND I'M GOING TO THE POLICE. WHAT? FROM SEEING ME AT THE PARTY WITH JONATHAN? YES. THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT THAT STUFF INTO HIS DRINK! NO, NO! LISTEN TO ME. I... WE TALKED ABOUT THE BOOK. ABOUT HIS BOOK. I-I-I TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM THAT HIS BOOK WAS TOO IMPORTANT TO HOLD BACK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT MY FATHER. HE... HE DID WHAT HE DID. IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES. I GAVE HIM MY WORD. THE BOOK ONLY COMES OUT AFTER HIS OR MY DEATH. BUT THAT'S CRAZY! HE'S A HEALTHY MAN. HE COULD LIVE A LONG... HE COULD OUTLIVE YOU. OKAY, SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHY COME TO THE FAIR, YOU KNOW, IF... I'VE ALREADY TOLD BARRETT NOT TO DISTRIBUTE THE CHAPTERS AND TO CANCEL THE BIDDING. I'M NOT SELLING THE RIGHTS TO THIS PIECE ANY MORE. WHY NOT? IT'S YOUR BOOK. IT'S YOUR LIFE. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO TELL THE STORY, TO RIGHT THE WRONG. YOU CAN'T WASTE THAT! RICHARD, PLEASE! DON'T. MY DECISION IS FINAL. I SPOKE WITH YOUR FATHER TODAY. OH... GREAT. I SUPPOSE HE WEPT ON THE PHONE... Schmidt: [ To Judith ] YOU SEE, THERE WAS NO WAY TO CONVINCE HIM. HE WAS A VERY STUBBORN MAN. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? JONATHAN TOLD HIS AGENT TO CANCEL THE BIDDING? NOT TO SELL THE RIGHTS? ARE YOU SURE? HE WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. [ Sigh ] SO... BARRETT WOULD LOSE HIS COMMISSION? MH-MM. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. A HELL OF A LOT OF MONEY. I'M SORRY. HUH? I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW, FOR BEING SO MEAN TO YOU. [ Sighing ] IT'S ALL RIGHT. WHEN THE BOOK COMES OUT, I'LL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT, WON'T I? [ Sigh ] THAT'S GOT TO BE WORTH AT LEAST 2 MILLION. [ Sniffle ] OH, SHIT! I'M LATE. [ Lounge ♪♪♪ ] Cowboy: NOW I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT, UH, AMERICAN INFLUENCE, AND UH... OH, GOD, WHAT'S THAT OTHER... UH, CULTURAL IMPERIALISM. THANK YOU. HEY, IS THAT THE TOPIC? THAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR, PARTNER. CULTURAL IMPERIALISM. SO TELL ME THIS: WHY IS IT EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND, IT'S YOU GERMANS WHO ARE BUYING AN- OTHER AMERICAN HOUSE? I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION. MARSHA? IT'S BARRETT. MARSHA? OH, SHIT! [ Beeps of dialling ] COME ON, FRITZ! EVERY TIME YOU WANT A COP, HE'S NOT THERE! [ Panting ] OOP. OH! HERE I AM. HERE. WE'VE GOT TO GO. WHERE? TO BARRETT'S PARTY. WHERE IS IT? I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT THE COP HERE. SO IT'S NO LONGER MR. FREIMANN OR MR. SCHMIDT? NO. I HAVE PROOF THAT IT IS BARRETT. YOU FOUND THE NICOTINE BOTTLE IN HIS POCKET? PLEASE STOP WASTING TIME AND FIND OUT WHERE THE DAMN PARTY IS! ...KEEP YOUR HEAD STRAIGHT WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON. WELL, WELL. THE ANGEL OF DEBT. LET'S TALK. I'LL BE BACK. OH, THANK YOU. Marsha: THANK YOU. I READ THE LAST CHAPTER. IT'S BRILLIANT. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH THE RUMOURS. IT STANDS UP ON ITS OWN. GOD, HE WAS A WONDERFUL WRITER. YES, HE WAS. HERE'S TO HIM. SO, HAVE YOU HAD THE BIDS YOU WANTED? OH! GOD, MARSHA. I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW. LAST HOUR, I'VE BEEN IN A DAZE. I DON'T KNOW. I'M A WRECK. IT'S REALLY NOT FAIR TO THE FAMILY, THAT I'M NEGOTIAT- ING IN THIS STATE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH END'S UP. ALL I KNOW IS, IS THAT IT'S THE LOSS OF A VERY GREAT TALENT. MARTIN, I'M PREPARED TO OFFER TWO MILLION. TWO MILLION? I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT BID IS HIGH... THE TWO MILLION YOU OWE ME FOR MARGARET DAURIE CANTOR. OWE YOU? SHE'S NOT JUST SICK. AND YOU HAD TO KNOW THAT. THOSE LAST CHAPTERS WEREN'T EVEN HERS. WERE THEY, MARTIN? SO. FOR "WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN", TWO MILLION. FROM YOU TO ME, AND BACK TO YOU FOR JONATHAN'S ESTATE. FROM ME? I DON'T HAVE THE 2 MILLION. DON'T YOU? NO. IT WAS MARGARET'S MONEY. IT WAS HER CONTRACT. I GOT 200,000, WHICH WAS MY COMMISSION. MARSHA, LOOK. SHE CONVINCED ME. SHE LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS GONNA BE ABLE TO FINISH THAT BOOK. I ADMIT, THE LAST CHAPTERS ARE SUBSTANDARD, AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE SHE'S GOT AT LEAST ONE MORE GOOD BOOK IN HER. YOU MUSTN'T BLUFF A BLUFFER, MARTIN. I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE A SERIOUS BID, THAT'S UP TO YOU. OH, I AM DEADLY SERIOUS. I'M GOING TO GO OVER THERE AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE ON THE PLANET EARTH. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE, MARTIN. AND YOU KNOW IT. HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT TO DO? SORRY, EXCUSE ME. LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH YOU. ANYWAY... YOU ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH ME. NO. LOOK, MARSHA, AND YOU ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH ME RIGHT NOW! I'M GOING TO BE TAKING A PLANE OUT OF HERE. YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS! JUST KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN. DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON? WE NEED A CUP OF--A GALLON-- YOU'VE BEEN USING JONATHAN! OF BLACK COFFEE RIGHT HERE. I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU. ALL OF YOU. YOU'RE ALL SO SATISFIED WITH YOURSELVES! YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT BOOKS. YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THEM. ALL YOU CARE ABOUT ARE DEALS AND FINANCING AND ANYTHING EXCEPT THE WORK, THE WRITING, THE WRITERS, THEY'RE JUST AN INCONVENIENCE. HOW'D WE GET TO THIS? WE'VE JUST MADE A MESS OF IT, ONE BIG BLOODY MESS OF IT! AND YOU TWO, STANDING THERE. WORDS ARE NOT OIL WELLS. OIL SITS IN THE GROUND, BUT WORDS, WORDS FLOAT ALL AROUND US, IN THE AIR. AND IF, AND IF ONLY WE HAD THE COURAGE... IF... [ Laboured breathing ] Martin: YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MARSHA. YOU'VE CERTAINLY LIGHTENED THE TONE OF THIS LITTLE GATHERING OF WHOREMONGERS. WE'RE ALL PROPERLY CHASTISED. YOU'VE CAST THE MONEYLENDERS OUT OF THE TEMPLE. YOU'VE CAST YOURSELF IN THE ROLE OF JESUS CHRIST. I'M SURE THAT PUTS YOU IN LINE FOR SOME STOCK OPTIONS. [ Laughter ] NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I... I THINK WE ALL OUGHT TO FORGIVE MARSHA HER OVERZEALOUS, SELF- RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION. IT'S FORGIVEABLE BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT AND TRAGIC WEEK, AND, UH, I HAVE TO SAY THIS MOMENT, FOR ME PERSONALLY, IS BITTERSWEET, BUT, ONWARDS. THE WINNER OF THE AUCTION FOR "WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN", WITH THE GRATEFUL THANKS OF JONATHAN MATTHEWS' FAMILY, FOR $2 MILLION, CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW OWNERS OF THE LIST COMPANY. [ Applause ] [ Inaudible exchange ] I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF. OKAY, TAKE IT EASY. [ Mixed chatter ] [ Sobbing/panting ] [ Panting ] MARSHA! CALL AN AMBU- LANCE, PLEASE! YEAH. I'VE LOST IT. I'VE LOST MY JOB. I'VE LOST THE BOOK. [ In German ] GET AN AMBULANCE! YES, TO THE PUB, GO! [ In English ] I'M FINE. OH! THE FRANKFURT FLOP. THE AMBULANCE! JA! [whispers] [ In German ] OKAY, IN 10 MINUTES, AS FAST AS POSSIBLE! [ In English ] WHAT DID SHE SAY? I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET. WHAT DID SHE SAY? "BARRETT". OKAY? SHE SAID BARRETT. THE AMBULANCE IS COMING. IS MR. BARRETT INSIDE? NO, NOT ANYMORE. YEAH, HE LEFT A MINUTE AGO. MAYBE FIVE. THE AMBULANCE IS COMING. IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY. JUST BREATHE. JUST BREATHE, JUST BREATHE. JUST BREATHE... IT'S OKAY. [ ♪♪♪ ] ALL PACKED. OH. GOOD. DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR THE PLANE? YES. GREAT. THEN WE'RE ALL SET. [ Loud knock on door ] I'LL, UH, BE BACK IN A SECOND. I'LL JUST SEE WHO THAT IS. [ Knock on door ] WHO IS IT? Murnau: IT'S INSPECTOR MURNAU, FROM FRANKFURT POLICE. JUST A MINUTE. YES. YOU ARE THE BIGGEST... YOU SHUT UP! HELLO, MR. BARRETT. OH... I, UM... WHAT? HAVE THE MANUSCRIPT THAT YOU WANTED. OH. I FOUND A COPY OF IT. HERE YOU GO. IT'S VERY NICE. OH, YOU'RE LEAVING TONIGHT? YES! I HAVE TO GO. I HAVE A CLIENT THAT IS NOT FEELING, UH, WELL, AND I HAVE TO TAKE HER BACK HOME TONIGHT. THE BIDDING IS OVER? THE BIDDING IS, UH... OVER, AND MARSHA HILLIER, SHE, UH, WON THE AUCTION. MARSHA? SHE'S IN HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW. WHAT? YEAH. IT SEEMS SHE HAS BEEN POISONED. [ Sigh ] THIS, UH, SON OF A BITCH IS STILL ON THE LOOSE? OH, NO, NO, NO, NO. DON'T BE AFRAID. I THINK HE IS APPREHENDED. WELL, THANK GOD FOR THAT. I'M VERY HAPPY, 'CAUSE WE KNOW WHICH POISON YOU USE. I... I USE? FOR YOURSELF, YOU JUST TOOK A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S TRUE, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. NO? YOU DON'T KNOW? NO, I DON'T. I CAN TELL YOU. YOU WANTED HER OUT OF YOUR WAY 'CAUSE SHE KNEW A LOT ABOUT YOUR FORGING MANUSCRIPTS, AND STEALING MONEY FROM CLIENTS, AND MOST OF ALL SHE REALIZED THAT YOU ARE THE MURDERER OF JONATHAN MATTHEWS. [ In German ] HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? [ In English ] OH, BE CAREFUL. INSULTING AN OFFICER IS A MAJOR FELONY IN GERMANY. SIT DOWN, PLEASE. SIT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT KIND OF POISON WAS USED ON THOSE PEOPLE. THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO LINK ME TO ANY OF THAT. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? I SAID SHUT UP! WHY DON'T YOU ARREST THE SON OF A B--? [ Rapping on door ] HELLO, EVERYBODY. YOU'RE MARSHA'S FRIEND. YES. YOU'RE JUDITH. RIGHT. I'M INSPECTOR MURNAU, FROM FRANKFURT POLICE. UH-HUH. MARTIN, I DON'T KNOW WH... WHAT THIS IS. I TOLD YOU, MARTIN, NO MORE PILLS OR DROPS OR POWDERS. I'M FED UP WITH ALL THAT GARBAGE. OH, MADAME. I THINK IT BELONGS TO ME NOW. IT'S YOURS. YOU KEEP IT THEN. [ Sniffing ] WHAT IS IT? NICOTINE, A BROWNISH LIQUID. YOU'VE GOT ANY MORE COMMENTS ABOUT THAT? MR. MARTIN BARRETT IS GOING TO BE IN GERMANY FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. THAT'S TRUE. I HAVE A FLIGHT TO CATCH. Judith: SO, BARRETT STOLE THE 2 MILLION FROM MARGARET. Murnau: HE NEEDED EVERY PENNY TO COVER HIS DEBTS. SO WHEN JONATHAN TOLD HIM HE DIDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH... YEAH, BUT WHY POISON HIMSELF? IS HE DEAD? NO, UNFORTU- NATELY NOT. HE GAVE HIMSELF JUST ENOUGH TO FAKE IT, THEN HE CALLED YOU TO SET YOU UP. LUCKY FOR YOU, YOU WERE NEVER UNDER SUSPICION. MISS HILLIER, YOU KNOW ABOUT MY HABITS, AND... I HAVE TO TAKE MY DOSE NOW. [ In German ] I'LL BE OUTSIDE, JUDITH. SO YOU'VE MANAGED TO PICK UP A LITTLE GERMAN AFTER ALL. LITTLE? Both: [ Giggling ] NICE WORKING WITH YOU, FRITZ. NAME IS ERNST. I KNOW. SO LOOK AT US, HUH? SOLVED A MURDER. PREVENTED ANOTHER ONE. GREATLY IMPROVED INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. SEE WHAT I MEAN? THAT COULD STAND MORE WORK. [ In German ] OH, BOY! WAS THAT GOOD! Marsha: JONATHAN MATTHEWS' BOOK SHOCKED THE WORLD WITH ITS REVELATIONS. NOW, A YEAR AFTER ITS PUBLICATION, WE'RE HERE TO WITNESS THE RESULT OF THOSE REVELATIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE MANY MUSEUMS AROUND THE WORLD FOR TAKING PART IN THIS GROUND-BREAKING EXHIBITION. THESE PAINTINGS ONCE HUNG IN ANOTHER ROOM, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. Richard: THE SHOW AND THE BOOK ARE A HUGE SUCCESS. YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE WHOLE STORY TO LIGHT. THE TRUTH IS, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE DONE IT, A LONG TIME AGO. I WOULD NEVER, NEVER HAVE HAD THE COURAGE. DOESN'T MATTER. [ Sigh ] THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE COLLECTION IS TOGETHER AGAIN. [ ♪♪♪ ] Marsha: NOW, THANKS TO JONATHAN MATTHEWS, THE LATE AND DEARLY MISSED JONATHAN MATTHEWS, THE REBBERS HAVE BEEN REWRITTEN INTO HISTORY. Sam: MORE COFFEE, MOM? Judith: NO THANKS, SWEETIE. OH, I'LL HAVE SOME, SAM, PLEASE. I STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. HEY, NO FAIR. YOU CAME TO HALIFAX TO HAVE A REST, RIGHT? TO GET AWAY FROM THE PUBLISHING BUSINESS. YEAH, I'VE GOT A WHOLE TOUR PROGRAMME ORGANIZED FOR YOU TOMORROW. YEAH, AND I STILL HAVE WORK TO DO ON THE CANTOR MANUSCRIPT. HOW IS IT? IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY MOVING. I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA, DOCUMENTING HER STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM CONTROL OF HER LIFE AND WORK. IT'S FANTASTIC. [ ♪♪♪ ] Man: MISS HILLIER? I'M JONATHAN MATTHEWS. I... I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TEACHING A WRITING WORKSHOP HERE. YES. I WAS WONDERING... WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WRITER? TO WRITE ONLY WHAT MATTERS. TO WHO? TO HIMSELF. [ ♪♪♪ ] GOODBYE, JONATHAN. [ ♪♪♪ ]
