(Multicom Jingle) (horn blaring) (stately music) (singing in foreign language) (breezy music) - [Chamberlain] This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. - [Reporter] This is the BBC Home Service. The German Army invaded Holland and Belgium early this morning by land and by landings from parachutes. - [Reporter] This is Trafalgar Square. The noise that you hear at the moment is the sound of the air raid sirens. I'm standing here just on the steps of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. A searchlight just burst into action off in the distance, one single beam sweeping the sky above me now. - [Reporter] In daylight raids, between 350 and 400 enemy aircraft were launched in two attacks against London and southeast England. About half of them were shot down. - [Winston Churchill] Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. - [Reporter] A Japanese flash, imperial headquarters announced a state of war with the United States. We'll repeat that again. A Japanese flash, imperial headquarters announced a state of war with the United States. - [Roosevelt] Yesterday, December 7th 1941, a date which will live in infamy, United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. (rhythmic drumbeat) (stirring music) (rhythmic drumbeat) (solemn music) - [Narrator] As 1942 opened, Adolf Hitler was master of Europe. His army stood on the Atlantic coast of France and at the gates of Moscow. Stalin demanded that the Allies open a second front to put more pressure on the Germans. He dispatched his foreign secretary Molotov to Britain to warn the Western Allies that he was unfairly bearing the brunt of the struggle and could not hold out much longer on his own. (cannons booming) (rhythmic drumbeat) In Berlin, Hitler intensified the other war he had been waging. At a villa in Wannsee, his henchmen had worked out how many millions of Jews would need to be murdered to purge Europe of its 2,000-year-old Jewish presence and heritage. Under Nazi rule, more than six million Jews were trapped. In Poland over the next few months, the Nazis began implementing the Final Solution by deporting the Jews to the death camps. (somber music) (children laughing) - [Narrator] Adolf Berman recalled the scene outside the children's orphanage of Janusz Korczak. The Germans were shouting at them. (man shouting in foreign language) "All get down." Stefania Wilczynska told the children they were going on a trip and at last they were going to see woods and fields and the flowers they'd been yearning for. One could see a smile flickering on their pale lips. A few hours later, they were put into the death carriages and taken away, the guardians and the teachers together with their children. (train chugging) (train whistle blaring) - [Narrator] In the summer of 1942, the German Army had advanced towards the Volga. Analyzing their strategic situation, the British Chiefs of Staff decided that a cross-channel invasion at this moment would be impossible. President Roosevelt went along with their recommendation, but insisted that something must be done to relieve the pressure on the Russians. The result was the decision to invade northwest Africa later that year. In August, Churchill traveled to Moscow to personally give Stalin the bad news. During a heated debate which ensued, an incensed Stalin demanded, "When are you going to start fighting, "or are you going to let us do all the work?" Britain had not engaged the Nazis since the miraculous rescue of her armies from Dunkirk in the late spring of 1940, but she had made valuable contributions to the war effort. Her pilots had stopped the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. (explosion booming) Her scientists had cracked the Enigma code, a device used by the Nazi high command to transmit messages to their entire command structure. With the help of the Poles, British intelligence located an Enigma machine and brought it back to England. - [Narrator] The occupation of France was now in its third year, but even to the Nazis, Paris was special. One of their first acts upon entering the city was to confine private cars, taxis, and buses to their garages. Only government-approved vehicles could travel the wide and beautiful boulevards of Paris. (gentle music) ♪ The last time I saw Paris ♪ ♪ Her heart was warm and gay ♪ ♪ I heard the laughter ♪ - [Narrator] Josef Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, wanted at all costs to return Paris to being the world capital of pleasure and gaiety, la Ville Lumiere. ♪ Her trees were dressed for spring ♪ ♪ And lovers walked beneath those trees ♪ ♪ And birds found songs to sing ♪ ♪ I dodged the same old taxicabs ♪ ♪ That I had dodged for years ♪ - [Narrator] In the early part of the war, the tourist industry was booming. Hitler was offering all his troops a holiday in Paris. A special organization called Jeder Einmal in Paris, Paris for everyone once, was set up. (singing in foreign language) The music halls and cabarets were packed, and there were always ways of circumventing the imposed 1,250-calorie-per-day forced rationing. Special restaurants offering culinary delights for a 1,000 francs per meal were available for the influential and rich. (singing in foreign language) (audience applauding) (gentle music) Then there was the other Paris, that of the brutal occupation. (singing in foreign language) People went to bed hungry. Misery was everywhere. As citizens watched the Boche plunder great works of art, the Gestapo and their Vichy cohorts were always monitoring and watching. Even going to the movies required that the lights be turned on during the newsreel presentations to prevent the moviegoers from hissing the pictures of the occupiers. By that summer, the Final Solution had come to Paris as well. At first, Jews were excluded from public life, from visiting restaurants and theaters. They were assigned the last carriage on the Metro and not permitted to use any public telephones. Then when the deportations began, it was the French police themselves who dispatched their fellow Jewish citizens to the Drancy Transit Camp. By the beginning of 1942, the ideas of planning for a cross-channel invasion of France became more of a reality once the United States had entered the conflict. But in the first few months following her declaration of war, the United States was far from being prepared to lead that campaign. This was apparent from the behavior of various government agencies. When the nation's capital staged its first ever air raid drill, the whole city took cover. But on the designated hour, Washington discovered that the air raid siren could not even be heard across the street. But bureaucratic bungling aside, Washington had a war to wage, a war President Roosevelt was determined to win. He had invited Winston Churchill to the White House to light the Christmas tree in December 1941. - [Churchill] When I warned them that Britain would fight on alone whatever they did, their generals told their prime minister and his divided cabinet, "In three weeks, "England will have her neck wrung like a chicken." Some chicken. (crowd laughing and applauding) Some neck. (crowd laughing and applauding) (jaunty music) ♪ Who do you think you are kidding, Mr. Hitler ♪ ♪ If you think we're on the run ♪ - [Narrator] The president wanted Hitler to know that from this point on, sooner or later, the Allies would return to Europe to take the continent back from the Nazi dictator. ♪ 'Cause who do you think you are kidding, Mr. Hitler ♪ ♪ If you think old England's done ♪ - [Narrator] But such a notion was complete fantasy for the Jews of Warsaw, the largest Jewish community in Europe and the largest in the world outside New York. (bell tolls) Following the expulsion of Jews from many neighboring towns into Warsaw, more than 400,000 Jews had been confined into the ghetto. (somber music) - [Narrator] One eyewitness, Aleksander Donat, recalled, "I saw a young mother run downstairs into the street "to get milk for her baby. "Her husband, who worked at the Ostbahn, "had as usual left earlier that morning. "She was headed for a shop "where she knew they sold milk under the counter. "She walked into Operation Reinhard. "The executioners demanded her ausweis. "'Upstairs, ostbahn, work certificate, "'I'll bring it right away.' "'We've heard that one before. "'Have you got an ausweis with you or not?' "She was dragged, protesting, to the wagon, "scarcely able to realize what was happening. "'My baby is all alone, milk!' she protested. "Then for the first time, "she really looked at the men who were holding her "and she saw where she was being dragged, "to the gaping entrance "at the back of a high high-boarded wagon "with victims already jammed into it. "I can still hear her screaming in a half-crazed voice, "somewhere between a sob of utter human despair "and the howl of an animal." - [Narrator] By that time, reports about the deliberate Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews had reached the West. The Allies wanted Pope Pius XII to join them in a joint declaration condemning the atrocities. The pontiff refused to participate in such a public denunciation, preferring more private channels and steering a more neutral course for the Church so as not to offend German Catholics. The Vatican could not, however, contain its delight that the Nazis were on the verge of defeating the Church's principal nemesis, communism. Indeed, according to Mother Pasqualina, Pius' devoted housekeeper, when news first reached the pope of the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in June of 1941, Pius prayed and said novenas for the swift victory of Hitler and his armies. ♪ Amen ♪ - [Narrator] With the war in the Pacific intensifying, ships carrying American GIs began arriving in England to begin training for carrying on the conflict in the Atlantic. While going off to war was difficult for all soldiers, it was especially difficult for some minorities. Japanese Americans were serving in the American Army while their kinfolk were being held in detention camps. - [Narrator] At home, despite all the talk of patriotic unity for the sake of the war effort, American blacks were still second-class citizens. They could fight and die for their country, but according to Secretary of War Stimson, "The Negro still lacks the particular initiative "which a commanding officer needs in a time of war." And if they opened their hometown newspaper, they could read about the ideas of Senator Bilbo from Mississippi, who rose in the United States Senate to defend a bill he had previously proposed that would deport all blacks to Liberia. It was, he said, "a permanent solution "to the race question we have before us now "and which we will have in the future." ♪ Over there ♪ ♪ Over there ♪ ♪ Send the word, send the word over there ♪ ♪ That the Yanks are coming ♪ ♪ The Yanks are coming ♪ ♪ The drums rum-tumming everywhere ♪ ♪ So prepare ♪ ♪ Say a prayer ♪ ♪ Send the word, send the word to beware ♪ ♪ We'll be over ♪ ♪ We're coming over ♪ ♪ And we won't come back till it's over over there ♪ - [Leader] Fall in! (breezy music) Atten-hut! Present aim! - [Narrator] For some blacks, this prejudice accompanied them all the way to England. In war Somerset, the vicar's wife told shopkeepers to serve blacks, but then ask them not to come back again. An item in the New Statesman reported, one English lady trying to help the war effort wrote to the commander of the local US unit to invite half a dozen men to Sunday lunch. She scribbled on the invitation, "No Jews please." When Sunday came and the lady opened the door to welcome her guests, before her stood six black GIs. Horrified, she exclaimed, "There must be some mistake." "Oh, no, ma'am," one of the soldiers replied. "Colonel Cohen doesn't make any mistakes." ♪ Bugle Boy of Company B ♪ - [Narrator] A mood of uncertainty still gripped England as the war went into its third year. True, America had entered the war and the bombing raids over London had stopped, but Hitler's armies remained invincible. (foreboding music) His U-boats still caused great havoc to Allied convoys all along the Atlantic. (explosion booming) That uncertainty was heightened when the Allied raid on Dieppe ended in disaster. A force of 5,000 Canadians had raided the French coast in August. The Germans were waiting for them, and by the time the battle ended, only 2,211 Canadians returned to England. The rest were either killed or captured. Elsewhere on the continent, the Resistance was beginning to defy the Nazis more brazenly. In Holland, leaflets of the Dutch Underground appeared throughout Amsterdam. The leaflets declared, "God and history will condemn us. "Whoever remains glued to his chair "will have to explain himself after the liberation." (ominous music) - [Narrator] Eleazar Malamud remembered when the Germans entered the ghetto at Stolpce. They began shooting and searching. He and his girlfriend found a room in which to hide behind some sacks of flour. A mother and her three children followed them into the house. The mother hid in one corner of the room, the three children in another. The Germans entered the room and discovered the children. One of the children, a young boy, began to scream, "Mama, Mama!" as the Germans dragged the children away. But another of them shouted to his brother in Yiddish. (boy speaking in foreign language) "Don't say mama. "They'll take her too!" The boy stopped screaming. The mother remained silent. Her children were dragged away. The mother was saved. "I will always hear that," Malamud recalled, "especially at night." (speaking in foreign language) "Don't say mama." - [Narrator] Josef Goebbels invited 60 German editors to the throne room of the Propaganda Ministry in Berlin for a realistic assessment of the war. Goebbels then revealed that there were 48,000 Jews still living in Berlin. "They know with deadly certainty "that as the war progresses, "they will be packed off to the east "and delivered out to a murderous fate. "They already feel the inevitable harshness "of physical extermination. "Therefore they harm the Reich whenever possible "whilst they yet live." Eight months later, detailed notes of the Goebbels speech were brought to England and shown to the senior officials of the British government. They noted them with great interest, but decided to keep their contents secret. (foreboding music) In the east, there were staggering losses. The German troops there knew that the Russian winter would soon be upon them. The Allies had stepped up the nightly bombing raids on targets in major German cities. (man on radio murmuring) (fire crackling) It was no longer possible to pretend that all was well. By late 1942, the war had finally reached Berlin as well. Only two years previously, following the fall of France, the city was the setting of jubilant parades welcoming the Fuehrer back from his latest conquest. Then he was their conquering hero who could do no wrong. (crowds cheering) But now there was a sudden shift in the mood as Berliners perceived a change in the war's direction. (people chattering) The talk in the cafes along the Kurfurstendamm was about the new shortages of meats and paper products and the terrible letters from the front. (tense music) One soldier writing home lamented, "If only Hitler had started the Russian campaign "six weeks earlier "or if our winter clothing would have arrived on time. "Yes, if, if, only if." - [Announcer] The triumphant conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad with the capture of eight more German generals and 45,000 other prisoners in the past two days has overshadowed the rest of the news from Russia. - [Narrator] Yet in early 1943, despite the devastating reversal at Stalingrad, he was still master of Europe, still plundering her economies and enslaving millions of her workers to shore up the German workforce. In Berlin, the German people's Winter Aid Campaign complained in a letter to the administration of the Lodz Ghetto about the quality of the shipment of clothing. The officials pointed out that the large amounts of jackets, dresses, and underwear had not been properly cleaned, that many articles were badly soiled and were permeated with bloodstains and dirt. The letter said, "If those receiving the clothes "were to become aware of their origin, "the Winter Aid Campaign would be discredited." In Poland, the deportation to the death camps continued. Meir Alta, a well-known cantor, was on the way to the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw with his father. When asked by the SS escort why the old man did not walk by himself, Alta explained that his father was blind. "Oh," the Nazi said, and then fired a single shot, killing the blind man instantly. - [Colonel Britton] This is Colonel Britton speaking, and here's the letter V, the sign of victory, in Morse.

Here's to you and here is your show. - [Narrator] On the home front, women had to cope with the double responsibility of aiding the war effort and caring for their children even as they faced the anxiety of their men at war. (sprightly music) In England, millions joined service organizations like the Red Cross or the Women's Voluntary Service, running canteens, providing food, and organizing entertainment designed to bring good cheer for lonely servicemen far from home. Some worked in the Intelligence Services. Others worked in munitions, operating heavy machinery, building aircraft, working on the land, driving buses, ambulances, lorries, replacing the men now in the armed forces. And after a long hard day, they often looked forward to a night of leisure when they could relax and forget the war. (whistle blares) In London, a favorite spot was the Palladium where thousands joined servicemen and women to listen to Vera Lynn and join in the chorus singing "We'll Meet Again." ♪ We'll meet again ♪ ♪ Don't know where ♪ ♪ Don't know when ♪ ♪ But I know we'll meet again ♪ ♪ Some sunny day ♪ - [Narrator] In New York, there were Broadway shows like "Something for the Boys." ♪ I'm always doing something ♪ - [Narrator] Where Ethel Merman belted out Cole Porter favorites.

(gunfire banging) In his suicide letter, he wrote, "I cannot live when the remnant of the Jewish people "in Poland whom I represent is being annihilated. "I belong to them and their mass graves. By my death," he concluded, "I wish to express my vigorous protest "against the apathy with which the world resigns itself "to the slaughter of the Jewish people." (rhythmic drumbeat) - [Narrator] On July the 10th 1943, the Allies launched Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, the first opportunity to strike at the Nazis since the disastrous Dieppe raid 11 months earlier. Four days after the invasion of Sicily, President Roosevelt wrote to the Italian King Victor Emmanuel, "Mussolini plunged you into a war "which he thought Hitler had already won. "Your soldiers fought not for Italy, but for Germany. "The time has come for you to decide "whether Italians shall die for Mussolini and Hitler "or live for Italy and civilization." (crowd applauding) On July the 25th 1943, Mussolini was overthrown and arrested. ♪ What a surprise for the Duce, the Duce ♪ ♪ With Adolf, his name simply reeks ♪ ♪ His troops are on the run in all directions ♪ ♪ Directions ♪ ♪ They can't withdraw beyond the shore ♪ ♪ The Navy's in trim so I hope they can swim ♪ ♪ Ohhh, come, this is the last time ♪ (explosion booming) - [Narrator] Six weeks later on September the 8th 1943, Italy surrendered. Hitler learned about the surrender not from his commanders in the field, but from a BBC broadcast from London. - [Announcer] This has been a great day for the United Nations. The Italian armed forces have surrendered unconditionally, and an armistice has been granted. - [Narrator] Hitler immediately launched a massive counterattack that nearly drove the Allies back into the sea. That attack stopped the advance and prevented the Allies from gaining a foothold in the surrounding mountain ranges protecting the approaches to Rome. But the intensified fighting had little effect on the Final Solution, which continued unabated. (somber music) - [Narrator] In Poland, a member of the Sonderkommando, a group forced to burn the bodies, recorded what he saw in notes which he later buried near the gas chambers at Birkenau and were found after the war. "In the undressing chamber, "members of the Sonderkommando "were ordered to strip the children of their clothing. "There, a girl of five stood undressing her brother "who was one year old. "One of the Sonderkommando "came to take off the boy's clothes. "The girl shouted loudly, "'Don't lay your hand dripping with blood "'upon my lovely brother. "'I am his good mummy. "'He will die in my arms, together with me.'" - [Narrator] A few weeks earlier, 400 European rabbis, some of whom had just escaped Hitler's Europe, met to conduct the only march on Washington during the war years demanding action from the administration on behalf of the Jews of Europe. They had expected to be received by the president, but were informed by Presidential Secretary Marvin McIntyre that the president was unavailable because of the pressure of other business. In fact, Roosevelt's schedule that day was rather sparse. His decision to avoid the rabbis had been made on the recommendation of the leaders of two prominent Jewish organizations, who feared an embarrassing confrontation with the protesters. By that time, the Allied bombing campaign had struck much of Germany, including Dortmund, Hamburg, Cologne, Dusseldorf, the Ruhr, and Berlin again and again. (dramatic music) Following one such raid over the Bayerischer Platz, one of the most beautiful block of flats in the German capital, a man coming out of the rubble mocked, "Now we can call him Meier," referring to Reichsmarschall Goering's pledge in 1939 that Berlin would never be bombed or people could call him Meier. A few weeks later, following a raid on Hamburg where thousands were either wounded or killed, one woman yelled hysterically, "If there was a God out there, "he should have shown some mercy." "Leave God out of this," replied an old man. "Men make wars, not God." That same month, the Catholic pastor Bernard Lichtenberg, who had been imprisoned for two years for having publicly prayed for the Jews, was moved from his prison in Berlin. He died during the journey on his way to Dachau. (solemn music) In the Ponary Forest near Vilna, once the Jerusalem of Lithuania, a revolt had broken out. The revolt was organized by Isaac Dogim. Dogim and the other Jews had been forced to dig up the remains of Jews murdered earlier, then place them in layers on a pyre and burn them. One day, while working, he recognized the bodies of his wife, his three sisters, and three nieces. His wife was still wearing the medallion he gave her on their wedding day. Soon after, Dogim organized the revolt. 69 prisoners escaped. 16 survived the Nazi manhunt that followed and joined the partisans to fight on. Others, like Dr. Aharon Peretz, fought back by recording every detail for posterity. - [Narrator] "I saw shattering scenes. "It was near the hospital. "I saw automobiles which from time to time "would approach mothers with children "or children who were on their own. "In the back of them, two Germans with rifles "would be going as if they were escorting criminals. "They would toss the children into the automobile. "I saw mothers screaming. "A mother whose three children had been taken away "shouted at the German, 'Give me the children.' "The German said, 'You may have one.' "She went up into that automobile, "and all three children looked at her "and stretched out their hands. "Of course, all of them wanted to go with her, "but she didn't know which child to select, "and she went down alone and she left the car." - [Narrator] The Allied leaders now devoted much attention to the invasion. By early 1944, they were unanimous in their view that Japan could not win the war in the Pacific. Germany, on the other hand, although weakened by losses in Africa, Italy, and Russia, still retained her offensive strength. The conclusion, the invasion must not be delayed any longer. - [Narrator] General Eisenhower had been named the Supreme Allied Commander by President Roosevelt. Ike sent Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, his deputy commander, to England to have a look at the invasion plans. Montgomery, a great strategist, threw himself into the task and significantly broadened the depth of the attack from the designated 25 miles to 50 miles, arguing that it was necessary because of the beach congestion that had occurred during the invasion of Sicily. Montgomery won the argument, but then in typical Monty fashion, he soon went around creating the impression that he had conceived the whole invasion plan in the first place. His superior on the British Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sir Alan Brooke, once confided to King George VI, "Monty is a very good soldier, "but I think he's after my job." To which His Majesty replied, "I thought he was after mine." (tones beeping) - [Narrator] During the same period, Allied Intelligence had developed a strategy of its own, code-named Bodyguard. Its objective was to keep Hitler's 60 divisions as thinly spread out as possible from the Balkans to the Riviera and thus prevent them from linking up near the planned landing site. To achieve this ruse, a dummy force under General Patton, complete with tent cities and massive fortifications, was put in place. Set designers from Shepperton Studios created elaborate training centers good enough to fool German reconnaissance planes. Large formations of inflatable rubber tanks and artillery cluttered the hillside of southwest England. (stately music) In France, resistance to the occupation was now stronger than ever before. They had become extremely bold in their actions. On one occasion, they attacked the symbol of the occupation itself, the daily march of the Germans down the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe. At the German military headquarters in Paris, by the middle of May 1944, there was still no consensus as to whether the invasion would actually come. Both the staffs of General Jodl, Chief of the German High Command, and General von Runstedt thought it was all a bluff. On the other hand, the Commander in Chief of the Panzer Group West, General von Schweppenburg, felt certain the invasion was coming soon. He based his conclusion on the fact that King George himself had recently inspected the troops. To him, it was beyond the bounds of British protocol to use the king of England for a mere ruse. (foreboding music) The Germans had, however, beefed up their defenses since General Rommel took command of the beachheads. Rommel had installed half a million jagged triangles of steel, each strapped with deadly mines. In addition, over five million mines of different varieties were placed in the sands, bluffs, gullies, and pathways along the coast. All this was backed by concrete bunkers, sophisticated communication trenches, and every piece of artillery that the general could lay his hands on. But there was to be no May invasion. Unfavorable weather conditions had forced the Allies now to pin their hopes on a June 5th crossing. (radio voice murmuring) Lieutenant Colonel Helmuth Meyer, Head of Counterintelligence on the invasion front, had been given the two-part poem the Allies would use in alerting the French Resistance that the invasion was imminent. On the evening of June the 1st, just after the 9:00 p.m. BBC News, Meyer's men alerted him that the first line from Verlaine's poem, "The Long Sobs of the Violins of Autumn," had been broadcast. - [Announcer] This is London calling, the European News Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Here is the news. But first, here are some messages for our friends in occupied countries. The Trojan War will not be held. John is growing a very long beard this week. The long sobs of the violins of autumn. - [Narrator] Meyer immediately passed the information on to his superiors. But then when the identical line was rebroadcast on June the 2nd and June the 3rd, he became less convinced of the information's validity. Of even more importance was the discovery by Meyer's men that the Allies were now observing radio silence. Rather than focus his superiors' attention on the fact that an Allied radio silence was now in effect, Meyer stressed that the BBC was repeating over and over the first three lines of Verlaine's poem, but not the last three, which was the signal that the invasion would take place in 48 hours. - [Announcer] The long sobs of the violins of autumn. (solemn music) (dog barking) (birds squawking) - [Narrator] On the evening of June the 4th, Winston Churchill returned to the Annex in 10 Downing Street after an inspection tour of troops who were scheduled to take part in the Normandy Invasion. Churchill was sitting in his chair in the map room where he had watched the progress of so many battles when the news was brought to him that the Americans had liberated Rome. (bell tolling) (crowd cheering) - [Godfrey] This is Godfrey Talbot speaking from Rome. (man shouting in foreign language) I'm standing in the middle of the Piazza Venezia on this day of our occupation, and at this moment, the windows of the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia from which Mussolini used to make his speeches, the windows have been opened. (children shouting) (people cheering and applauding) - [Narrator] Just before dawn at 4:15 a.m. on the morning of June 5th, General Eisenhower assembled all his commanders. Ike had already canceled the June the 5th invasion because of inclement weather. If he did so again on the sixth, there would be a further delay of two weeks as that would be the next time the tides off the coast of France would be suitable for the landing craft. Eisenhower looked at his commanders and said, "Okay, boys, we will go." (static crackling) - [Announcer] The long sobs of the violins of autumn wound my heart with a monotonous languor. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] That evening, the convoys began moving. It seemed that the whole human race was tuned in and following their course. On the eve of the invasion, Eisenhower made an inspection visit of the 101st Airborne Division. There he was surrounded by hundreds of paratroopers, all with blackened faces, gearing up for the most important jump of their lives. One soldier offered him a job after all this was over. Ike had made some tough decisions that day. In addition to ordering the invasion, he refused a request by Churchill to accompany the troops into battle. Churchill was angered by Ike's decision, but when he later told him that King George himself had also insisted on going, the matter was never raised again. The Supreme Allied Commander also wrote two press releases. One was read to all the soldiers taking part in the invasion that night. - [Announcer] "Soldiers, sailors, and airmen "of the Allied Expeditionary Force, "you are about to embark upon the great crusade "toward which we have striven these many months. "The eyes of the world are upon you. "The hopes and prayers "of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you." - [Narrator] Most soldiers used the time immediately before the invasion to post a letter home to their families. Brigadier General Teddy Roosevelt Junior wrote to his wife, "We are underway. "The time is short now. "What the future holds for our enemies or us, no man knows." (planes buzzing) Roosevelt would never see his family again. He led his men in battle on the beaches and then died of a heart attack on July the 12th. The greatest armada ever assembled, more than 5,000 vessels, embarked for the Normandy coast. Ernie Pyle described it this way, "As far as you could see in every direction, "the ocean was infested with ships. (explosion booming) "There were battleships and all other kinds of warships "clear down to patrol boats. "There were great fleets of liberty ships, "fleets of luxury liners turned into troop transports, "landing crafts, tank carriers, and tankers, "even converted yachts, riverboats, tugs, and barges." (men chattering) (cannons booming) (men chattering) (cannons booming) After the first Allied units went ashore at dawn, the BBC broadcast news of the invasion on its morning report. - [Announcer] This is the BBC Home Service. Here is a special bulletin read by John Snagge. - [John] D-Day has come. Early this morning, the Allies began the assault on the northwestern face of Hitler's European fortress. - [Narrator] By dawn, the first units of what would be a massive force of more than 400,000 men and 200,000 vehicles were put ashore on the Normandy beaches. The invasion force was part of the 21st Army Group under the overall command of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. It consisted of the First United States Army under General Omar Bradley, whose objective was the Omaha and Utah Beaches in Normandy, and the Second British Army under Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey, whose objective was to secure the beaches around Cannes. The Germans were hesitant to commit additional forces for fear that these landings were only a prelude for the real invasion, which would come at Pas de Calais. (gunfire banging) But Allied soldiers still faced many obstacles. German artillery from well-fortified positions began pounding the beaches, pinning down the invasion forces. Hundreds of Allied soldiers were killed before they could ever fire a shot. Thousands lay wounded, hoping the medics would reach them in time. News of the invasion reached everywhere, even to the secret hiding place of Anne Frank and her family in Holland. In her diary for that day, Anne noted, - [Narrator] "This is D-Day. "The invasion has begun. "The English gave the news at eight o'clock this morning. "Seems too wonderful! "Seems like a fairy tale. "And Kitty, the best part of the invasion "is that I have the feeling that friends are approaching. "We have been oppressed by those terrible Germans "for so long that the thought of friends and delivery "fills us with confidence. "Now it doesn't concern the Jews anymore. "No, it concerns Holland and all of occupied Europe. "Perhaps, Margo says, I may yet be able to go back to school "in September or October. "Yours, Anne." - [Narrator] The Nazis had a surprise of their own in store for the Allies. Hitler had been promising that new secret weapons would be used against England, weapons, he boasted, that would bring Churchill and Roosevelt to their knees. (crowd cheering) A week after the landing at Normandy, he unleashed them. (plane buzzing) (explosion booming) (plane buzzing) The V-1 rocket was a jet-propelled flying bomb with a range of 250 miles, flying at a speed of 425 miles an hour. It could pinpoint a target to within a thousand yards. On June 16th, the V-1s crossed the English coast. Over a period of three months, Hitler launched 8,000, of which 2,400 got through, causing tens of thousands of casualties. (ominous music) (plane buzzing) (rocket roaring) (liftoff booming) This was followed by the longer range V-2 rocket. It had a faint hum that changed to a roar and then abruptly stopped as the engine cut out before finally ending in a shattering blast on impact. Unfortunately for Hitler and his collaborators, his weapons came too late to affect the outcome of the war. Allied planes soon were able to locate and destroy most of the V rocket launching sites. (explosions booming) - [Churchill] "We shall fight on the beaches. "We shall fight on the landing grounds. "We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. "We shall fight in the hills. "We shall never surrender." - [Narrator] By then, the Allies had broken out of the beachheads they had established. In Paris, the Germans were packing their bags, requisitioning everything that could move. They were all heading in the same direction, east towards Germany. At the Birkenau Extermination Camp, a new deception had been devised. A Frenchwoman, Claude Vaillant-Couturier, witnessed it. (gentle music) - [Narrator] To render their welcome more pleasant at this time, June, July 1944, an orchestra composed of internees, all young and pretty girls dressed in little white blouses and navy blue skirts, played during the selection on the arrival of the trains gay tunes such as "The Merry Widow" and the "Barcarolle" from "The Tales of Hoffman." But not everyone was fooled. On June the 24th, a Jewish girl, Mala Zimetbaum, escaped from Birkenau. For two weeks, she remained at liberty until she was recaptured. Her final fate was witnessed by several thousand Jewish women there. She was to be publicly hanged. Just before the rope was placed around her neck, she slit her wrists with a razor blade that someone had smuggled to her. Mala staggered to her feet and cried out in a terrible, loud voice, "I know I'm dying, but it does not matter. "What matters is that you are dying "and your gangster Reich too!" (stirring music) - [Narrator] With the cross-channel invasion now well in hand, the Allies turned their attention to Operation Anvil, the invasion of southern France. It began on August 15th when French paratroopers landed just west of Cannes. This was followed by an early morning assault of some 95,000 men from the Seventh Army under the command of Generals Patch and Truscott who went ashore through the opening of the 10-foot seawall that the Allies had made near Sainte-Maxime. For General Lattre and the Free French soldiers, it was a particularly emotional moment. It was the first time they were back on French soil. (tank rumbling) (gunfire banging) The Germans were no match for the Allies. (explosions booming) By August 28th, the Allied drive had taken Toulon and Marseilles. At that same time, General Brosset, riding in a Jeep, found an isolated road that led directly into Toulon. Leaving his troops at the city's outskirts, the general headed for the city center. He returned shortly, jubilantly shouting at his men, "Get a move on. "I've already been kissed by 200 girls." (people exclaiming) Meanwhile, to the north, the biggest prize of all, Paris, remained very much in doubt. The new German commander, General von Choltitz, had explicit orders from Hitler to destroy the city. The Allies, on the other hand, were not very keen on entering Paris. Eisenhower and Patton felt it would deflect from the main objective of getting to the Rhine as quickly as possible, thus preventing the retreating Germans from regrouping. (gunfire banging) But for de Gaulle and the Free French, the liberation of Paris meant everything. (explosion booming) De Gaulle felt it was crucial for him to be seen as the liberator of Paris. Otherwise, he feared the communists, who had played a significant role in the Resistance, would be handed an opportunity to broaden their national mandate. (people shouting) (stately music) (guns banging) On August 21st, following the uprising in the streets of Paris organized by the Resistance, General von Choltitz invited Swedish Consul General Nordling to his office at the Hotel Meurice. There, von Choltitz put a proposal before him. "Tell de Gaulle to enter Paris and take control. "Otherwise," he told Nordling, "I will have to destroy the city." Another delegation headed by Roger Gallois was already at General Bradley's headquarters with a similar warning. "You must come to our help, "or there will be a terrible slaughter." Bradley immediately brought the information to Eisenhower who reluctantly agreed that something must be done. (gunfire banging) On August 23rd, the French Second Armored Division under General Leclerc headed for Paris. On the evening of August 24th at 9:22 p.m., Captain Dronne's three tanks and six half-tracks arrived at the Hotel de Ville in the heart of Paris. Not very far away at the Hotel Meurice, General von Choltitz was having dinner when he overheard a young German woman at another table say, "Why have the church bells begun ringing?" The general turned around to her and said, "They're ringing for us, my little girl. "They're ringing because the Allies are coming to Paris." (bells tolling) - [Announcer] Hello, New York, hello, London. Hello, New York, hello, London. This is the French National Broadcasting. We take pleasure in bringing you the greetings of Paris that is fighting, but that it also has news of its liberation. The Germans are still occupying certain points of the capital, but we have already the possibility to speak to you. (people cheering) - [Narrator] That same afternoon shortly before 4:00 p.m., Charles de Gaulle entered Paris riding in a black convertible. - [Announcer] The general has now turned to face the square and this huge crowd of Parisians. He's being presented to people. (gunfire banging) He's being received. He's being received. Even while the general is marching, even while the general is marching into the cathedral. Well, that was one of the most dramatic scenes I've ever seen. Just as General de Gaulle was about to enter the Cathedral of Notre Dame, firing started all over the place. General de Gaulle was trying to control the crowds rushing into the cathedral. He walked straight ahead into what appeared to me to be a hail of fire from somewhere inside the cathedral, somewhere from the galleries up near the vaulted roof. But he went straight ahead without hesitation, his shoulders flung back, and walked right down the central aisle even while the bullets were falling around him. (speaking in foreign language) (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] By 8:00 a.m. August 25th, Leclerc's Second Division followed by the US Fourth Infantry entered Paris to a tumultuous welcome. (crowds cheering) - [Announcer] Here is the news read by Richard Wessel. - [Richard] Paris has been liberated. The communique just received from General Koenig announces that it has been liberated by French forces of the interior. (crowd singing in foreign language) (crowd cheering) - [Reporter] It's been one of the most marvelous sights I've ever seen, coming down the boulevards into the heart of Paris. Everywhere we went, people came running out of their houses, out of the shops, shaking hands with us. Children were held up to us to be kissed and they clung around our necks. People were giving us flowers, tomatoes, everything. It's been the most marvelous procession I've ever seen. Here they are, they're just mad with joy. Just listen to these crowds. (crowds cheering) ("Le Marseillaise") - [Narrator] As Paris broke out in celebration, some remembered the words of the Gaullist resistance leader, Pierre Brossolette, who committed suicide while in the hands of the Gestapo. Brossolette predicted that on the day of liberation, de Gaulle will be carried aloft the length of the Champs-Elysees on the wave of our women's tears of joy to ceaseless bursts of cheering. (crowds cheering) (jaunty music) With Paris now in the hands of the Allies, the German Western front disintegrated. Tens of thousands of German soldiers began a desperate retreat towards the Rhine. ♪ Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run ♪ ♪ Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run ♪ ♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang goes the farmer's gun ♪ ♪ Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run, run ♪ ♪ Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run ♪ ♪ Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun ♪ ♪ He'll get by without his rabbit pie ♪ ♪ So run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run ♪ - [Narrator] On the day the Allies entered Paris, Adolf Eichmann, the SS official in charge of implementing the Final Solution, left Budapest and returned to Germany. Eichmann had been in Hungary organizing the deportation of the country's 700,000 Jews to Auschwitz. Upon his return to Germany, he was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class for his services to his country. (train chugging) Among those deported were Simcha Bunim Unsdorfer who arrived in Auschwitz with his parents in 1944. His father was an important rabbi in Slovakia before the war. Unsdorfer wrote about what happened to them. (somber music) - [Narrator] "Suddenly, Dr. Mengele, "who made the selections, put a stop to the name reading. "To everyone over 45, he said (speaks in foreign language). "'Remain here.' "I summed up the situation in a second and told Father, "'Papa, you can easily say you are under 45 "'and come with me. "'You see what's happening.' "'How can I leave Mama here alone?' he answered. "'Papa,' I tried again desperately, 'you can!' "Father looked over at Mother "as she stood shivering in the line. "She looked several years older than he. "Mother then gave me a long, gentle look, "and my desperation fled. "I no longer wanted to drag Papa away from her. "'Mama,' I breathed "and felt an overwhelming desire to go over to her "for just one final second "to give one last little hug and kiss "to that frightened and shaking, frail little woman "who was my nearest and dearest, my most precious on Earth, "my own sweet and dear mama. "Just for one second. "But no. "'Du, you there!' "An SS man grabbed me and pulled me away. "There was not even a chance to turn around again, "and I had lost them, "lost them forever." (train chugging) (foreboding music) (explosions booming) - [Narrator] At the end of June, Marshal Zhukov, the hero of Moscow and the defender of Stalingrad, launched an attack near Brobusk that captured and destroyed 25 German divisions. By the end of July, the drive had taken them to the outskirts of Warsaw. They were now at the mouth of the Vistula with the heartland of the Rhine just before them. On July 24th, four days after the assassination attempt on Hitler's life at his headquarters at Rastenburg, the Soviet forces had entered the death camp at Maidanek. There, war correspondents from every Allied army gazed in horror at the gas chambers, crematoria, and the charred remains of human beings. (rhythmic drumbeat) - [Announcer] Here is a special announcement. Reports have come in from British Second Army Headquarters this morning with the good news that we are in Brussels. (crowds cheering) - [Edmund] There he goes, do you hear him shout? Three, four, fix, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. There they go, every man out. I can see their chutes going down now. Every man clear. They're dropping just beside a little windmill near a church. You can see one man go down. - [Narrator] The Allied operation achieved some of its objectives by taking Nijmegen and then crossing at Waal as well as many of the smaller target bridges. But the main objective, the bridge at Arnhem, was too well defended, and the Allies were unable to cross it. (gunfire banging) At Eagle's Nest, Adolf Hitler pored over his maps, analyzing the grim situation facing him on all fronts. On December 16th, Hitler took the final gamble by launching the Battle of the Bulge. (cannons booming) (somber music) The German attack caught the Allies completely off guard. Fog prevented their reconnaissance planes from discovering the German intentions, and infiltrators wearing American uniforms created havoc behind the Allied lines. (explosion booming) The Allies fought hard for every inch of ground, refusing the Germans entry to Bastogne, thereby denying them a desperately needed petroleum depot. On December 23rd, the weather on the front finally broke, and the Allies were able to resume their bombing attacks. By then, von Manteuffel's advance units had run out of fuel three miles short of the Meuse. The Battle of the Bulge was over. The Germans were decisively defeated, the best of its dwindling armor smashed. It was now only a matter of time before the dreaded symbol of the swastika itself was brought down. (rhythmic drumbeat) - [Narrator] On January 27th, Soviet troops came upon Auschwitz, uncovering for the world a killing factory unheard of in the annals of human civilization, the largest graveyard in human history. They had arrived barely in time to rescue a few hundred children, most of them twins who were kept alive as guinea pigs for Dr. Mengele's horrific experiments. But for most of the murdered, those like Edith Frank, Anne Frank's mother, they had arrived too late. She died at Birkenau on January 6th, 1945. Anne died at about the same time at Bergen-Belsen just a few days after her sister Margo fell from the upper bunk there and died from the shock of hitting the barracks floor. - [Leslie] Good afternoon. This is the Reverend Leslie Hardman, the Jewish chaplain to His Majesty's British Second Army, members of which liberated the Belsen Concentration Camp from which I am now speaking. We are assembled together in this now liberated concentration camp where so many thousands of our brothers and sisters have been incarcerated to hold the first Saturday or Shabbos morning service. I would like to give this message to you all. If all the sky was paper and all the trees in the world were turned into pens and all the waters in the oceans were ink, we would still have insufficient material on which and with which to describe all the horrors and sufferings these people here underwent at the hands of those foul, bestial, and inhuman beings called the SS. We will now end the service with the "Hatikvah," the song of hope and redemption. May the final redemption come to these people with whom I am now living. (singing in foreign language) - [Narrator] Earlier in January, the Soviets came upon another death camp, Treblinka. One of those brought to the site was Dr. Adolf Berman, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto. There, Berman saw thousands of shoes of every description. Later, the poet Moshe Shulstein, also a survivor, would write about the shoes of Treblinka. (somber music) "I have seen a mountain," he wrote, "higher than Mont Blanc and holier than Sinai. "Such a mountain I saw of Jewish shoes in Treblinka. "Suddenly, that mountain of shoes stands up "in pairs, in rows, "big shoes and little shoes, "from Warsaw and Paris, "from Amsterdam and Prague. "Shoes rabbis wore, "traders and workers, all sorts of shoes, "and the knitted booties of a little child. "Just like its parents, it was killed. "We were brought to Treblinka, marching heel and sole, "and now we are marching to get away "from the killing that went on night and day. "Let the world hear us come down the road. "Let the world listen to our tale of blood. "We shall not let you rest again." - [Narrator] The Allies were advancing along the whole front at a rate of about 40 miles per day. (artillery whizzing) By the first week of March, the US First Army had advanced as far as Cologne. By the middle of that month, General Patton had surrounded the entire Ruhr. The British and the Americans had finally settled the argument over Berlin. The Russians were to take the city. (tense music) Churchill felt it was of strategic importance in a postwar Europe for the Western Allies to liberate Berlin. However, Eisenhower's view prevailed, that from a military standpoint, it was an unnecessary risk of troops. (artillery booming) By April, Adolf Hitler was now well entrenched in his final residence in the Fuehrerbunker deep beneath the Chancellery in Berlin. There, he invited Josef Goebbels and his family to join him, along with Martin Bormann and a few other trusted aides. Each day, he still presided at the noontime conference, going through the machinations of running Germany's collapsing war machine. On April 28th, when he learned that his trusted aide, Heinrich Himmler, offered to surrender the German armed forces to the Americans and British, he flew into a rage, expelling him from the Nazi party. (gunfire banging) Earlier on April 23rd, he had done the same thing to Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering. Goering, not knowing whether Hitler was still alive in the bunker, sent him an urgent telegram from Berchtesgaden asking for permission to invoke the right of succession in the event he did not hear from him by 10:00 p.m. Now completely surrounded and feeling betrayed by even those closest to him, Adolf Hitler decided to write his last will and testament and then take his own life. Before doing so, he would marry Eva Braun as a reward for her loyalty. The ceremony took place past midnight the night of April 29th with Goebbels and Bormann serving as witnesses. (wind gusting) (people shouting) For Magda Goebbels, the fiercely loyal Nazi wife of the propaganda minister, the most difficult task was the plan to poison her six children. In a conversation with her friend and fellow resident of the bunker, the pilot Hanna Reitsch, she implored her, "When the end comes, Hanna, "you must help me if I become weak about the children. "They belong to the Third Reich and the Fuehrer, "and if these cease to exist, "there can be no further place for them." On the afternoon of April 30th, Adolf Hitler came out of his room at the Fuehrerbunker to bid a farewell to his intimate collaborators. Moments later, Hitler and Eva Braun ended their lives, Hitler by shooting himself and his bride by swallowing poison. Their bodies were then doused with gasoline and burnt. - [Announcer] This is London calling. Here is a newsflash. The German radio has just announced that Hitler is dead. I'll repeat that. The German radio has just announced that Hitler is dead. - [Narrator] 24 hours later in the early evening of May the 1st, Dr. Josef Goebbels poisoned his six children before instructing an SS orderly to shoot him and his wife. Their bodies were also then doused with gasoline and set on fire. (fire crackling) The Allied troops began liberating the concentration camps. By the third week of April, more than 100 camps and subcamps had been liberated. (somber music) - [Narrator] Among the survivors was Simcha Gunim Unsdorfer, who remembered hearing sirens wailing throughout the camp. At first, he feared that this was the end. He felt more dead than alive as he desperately racked his brain, trying to remember some prayer before taking leave of this world. But then suddenly his ears picked up what sounded like the rumble of tanks. Slowly, he barely lifted himself and peeked through the small barrack window until he saw amidst the thick clouds of dust and sand a column of tanks rolling past the entrance. They were brown with white stars painted on their sides. "The Americans!" he screamed madly, "The Americans!" Soon everyone in the camp was screaming. "We are free, we are free!" He heard the German political prisoners shout. "Home, home!" cried the Czechs, dancing and kissing. But after this momentary jubilation, reality sank in. "There were no happy hopes of reunion for us, only tears. "Tears that were stored away "from the moment of our arrival in Auschwitz "now poured down our sunken cheeks. "Only now did we have time to think "of our dear ones who had perished, "who were no longer here to see our hour of liberation "and join with us in what could have been "the happiest days of our lives. "Home, what home? "A place where nobody was waiting, "a place that no longer was and never would be again. "Free, free for what? "Only to moan and lament for the rest of our lives." (singing in foreign language) But for many others, the joy was too great to be held back by tragedy, too exhilarating to be buried even by great personal sorrow. With all the strength they could muster, they reached out to communicate with their liberators, to hold on to them and grasp their hands even if they were too weak to utter a sound. With their eyes, they told them that it had been too long since they last saw a smile, too long since they encountered someone who cared. With their tears, they declared how great it was to behold again the sight of human compassion. ("Taps") - [Narrator] On May the 8th, the day Germany surrendered, Dwight Eisenhower thanked his troops. "The route you have traveled through hundreds of miles "is marked by the graves of former comrades. "Each of the fallen died as a member of a team, "bound together by a common love of liberty "and a refusal to submit to enslavement." - [Announcer] This is the BBC Home Service. We're interrupting programs to make the following announcement. It is understood that in accordance with arrangements between the three Great Powers, an official announcement will be broadcast by the prime minister at three o'clock tomorrow, Tuesday afternoon, the 8th of May. - [Narrator] Winston Churchill broadcast to the British people and the world, announcing the end of hostilities. Toward the end of his speech, his voice cracked with emotion as he called out, - [Churchill] Advance, Britannia. Long live the cause of freedom. God save the King. (crowds cheering) (triumphant music) - [Narrator] "My dear friends, this is your hour. "This is not a victory of a party or any class. "We were the first in this ancient island "to draw the sword against tyranny. "After a while, we were left all alone "against the most tremendous military power "that has been seen. "The lights went out and the bombs came down, "but every man and woman in the country "had no thought of quitting the struggle. "I say that in the long years to come, "not only will the people of this island but of the world, "wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human hearts, "look back at what we have done. "They will say, 'Do not despair. "'Do not yield to violence and tyranny. "'March straightforward, "'and die if need be, unconquered.'" (solemn music) (ethereal music)
