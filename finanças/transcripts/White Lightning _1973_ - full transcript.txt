And then one of your buddies come up from behind and squeeze your chest real hard. Then you'd pass out and dream and go off. When you come round again, it felt like you'd been away a year. And you'd say, "How long was I out?" Everyone would laugh, because it had only been a few seconds. You see, I was about six year old when I first started huffing. I'd get me some of that lighter fluid, and I'd get me some of that good gasoline and huff it right up. By the time I was a younger man, I was pure animal. Seemed all's what I wanted to do was to get high. I'd wake up, my arms all bloodied and black with ink I'd scratched in there. Daggers and crosses, that sort of thing. There'd be whole weeks pass, can by can. Jesus. D. Ray. Get yourself in here. He's on the gas again. What? That's it. I told you little son of a bitch.

All over West Virginia, Kentucky, and all these parts, they still talk about the fast stepping feet of my daddy, D. Ray White. Now, git. I got him, D. Ray. Come on, Jessie. Well, more than one time, the sheriff took me right down to Meldwood. That's the West Virginia Industrial School for Boys. That's a reform school. Left, left, right, left. Left, left, left, right, left. Left. They'd shave you and spray you down to make sure you didn't have none of the blue ball crabs. Man, that shit burned. They sprayed your nuts too. Whoo.

Sometime, iffen you messed up and they thought Meldwood weren't strong enough in its punishments, they'd send you to Everet Work Camp. You really didn't want to go there. I guess they 'posed to make you better than what you are down there. Move it. But I don't suppose it took. 'Stead, I reckon it just made it worser, because soon as I'd get out, I'd just do something to get right back in. My daddy tried to fight it, though. He didn't want nothing from me but the dancing.

We know it's you, Jessie. You've been breaking in every store in town, stealing the lighter fluid. You want your daddy to come and collect you, boy? Now, wait a damn minute. You little son of a bitch. So I'd end up back in that place. In a place like that, things tend to happen that'll make you even worser still. Keep on sliding right down, you know? Well, one of the other boys decided he just plain didn't like me very well. So he and a few of the others worked me over pretty good right there in the washing room. Give me a cigarette. I don't have any. Boy, you better give me a cigarette. I told you I don't have any. Sure wish I did. I knew a kid from Boone County named Cedell Davis, and he took me and showed me how things ran, you know? Cedell then telled me that I best get him back quick and showed me how to make a kind of knife like a weapon out of tape, shaving razors, and a toothbrush. Well, I left a cigarette packet out on the bunk there in the dorm room. You see, them kids what beat me figured that they had call to any of my things. So they'd come over and took them. Well, I'll tell you now that I don't really recall what happened second for second. But at the end of it, all them boys had been beaten worser than I took. Their ears had been slit, their nostrils opened up and flapping, and their mouths cut wide like they was smiling, just like you'd cut a pig. ♪ I will dance, I will sing ♪ Some of them things that I done in my life come out of the gas and the like. Some of them things that would later happen come from Meldwood and the camp. And, hoar, there's madness that come from what happened to Cilla and D. Ray too. In the beginning, God created the Earth and the light, and all things good was born. After the devil fell from Heaven's grace, all men walked the Earth, and wars of suffering broke everywhere on the Earth. God cried and was angered. So's the floods came, and he drowned all the evil that had taken root, except in the devils in the soil and the rocks and the air.

Every day we'd go out there on the dirt out the front, and we'd hit it, you know? Get all them steps down. We'd dance in barefoot on account of it toughens up your feet and ankles. Well, we must have gone out there most days for about two or maybe five months. I got myself pretty good at dancing, and D.

But when I was out, I'd try and follow what my Daddy had said and hoping the dancing would keep me right. Things were like that for some year. I'd try and stay good, but I was weak. And sooner or later, I'd do something evil and get sent right back in. What you do that for? I was watching my own program. How can you say that to me like that? Hey, motherfucker. I told you I was watching my own program. Hey. I told you I was watching my own program. When I'd go off it and get in a fight or something like that, they'd hold me down and shoot me up with something to keep me good and quiet.

I was still incarcerated the night they killed my daddy. They didn't tell me about D. Ray for quite a time on account of all them drugs they had moving through my brain round then. They waited till I was back in my right mind. And that took a while, so even when they eventually told me, I don't suppose I understood just what it was they were saying. It is about six months that I had to sit and stew, thinking about what they did to my daddy. I loved my Daddy and will till the day I die. It is D. Ray White that gave me this life, and near the only good in it has been his doing. And they took that from me. Eye for an eye was my thinking, just like it says in the Bible. Now, I just want to make sure that you realise what you're getting yourself into, Mrs White. If you sign this, you're responsible for him and his continued care: making sure he takes his medication and goes to his psychiatric appointments. Can you explain it plain, on account of we don't have the education? Okay. Here. Take your hand. Now take it like this and put it on Jess's head. Like this. Now, his brain there, it's like, well... It's like ashes. Cigarette ashes? - Yeah, that's right. - Cigarette ashes. I don't think anything as sad or as powerful as my Daddy dying ever happened to me. His death is a deep hurt in my heart and in my brain too. It's a great pain when someone you love dies like that. Almost strong enough to change your whole life. Jesco, look here. You can work on your dancing now. Take your daddy's shoes. So I took them old shoes, and I made to set my life straight to get away from all the bad things what happened. Wait, wait. Well, on that one right there. Over where? Yeah, when you do that bounce and then shuffle... - Like this? - Yeah. I called up old Bob Huston. Bob played the guitar many times with Edgar Hood, the old banjo player what played all them years with Daddy. Now, on that one right there, you just need to bounce and then shuffle. Yes.

But I always had this problem, and no matter where I was or how good I was feeling, I was only one second away from thinking them bad thoughts and starting it all over. It is in me like a cancer, ruining my blood. I tried the good life, all right. But my guts is bad, turning over sour. See, I used to think real bad things. The time I was down there in Meldwood, I was on detail, you know? When you got to do work around the place and that sort of thing. So I was out there mowing and working hard and waving to them guards and all, when I get to thinking. What makes a lawn mower run? It's out of gas. Now, I don't know iffen I was dreaming or awake. But, man, I'll tell you, I had some thoughts come to me then that weren't no good. There was thoughts of killing and hurting every one of them guards. I had all kinds of them punishments.

He'd get Sam up there in that hayloft and real give a working. You know, naked like barnyard beauties, except faggot. Sam's pa went up the mountain to the new pasture, and Sam, well, I guess he didn't waste a minute. Tally hung there a few days, calling out till his voice went. Please, Daddy, help. Then his belly got real big from the gas that was in his guts, account of him being crucified of a sort. Well, the stink is so bad that you all could get a whiff of it all the way down the road. Now, Sam wanted Tally to feel that same pain in the gut, so he took his ma's old knitting needles from before she passed. That's how they came on him, sticking needles in his brother's fat belly. Bob wouldn't play for me no more, and Cill didn't want to go out on the road. Cill didn't like for me to party or drink at all, not even a beer neither. She said it weren't no good for my head.

But hell, the way I figure is that the Lord has a way of punishing people while they's here on Earth. No. No, no. Bye-bye, Long. ♪ Bite your head off about a half past 8.00 ♪ ♪ Now, baby, don't you be late ♪ ♪ Bite your head off about half past 8.00 ♪ Already in hell. You got to come with me now. Long paid for what he done, just like Davie paid. I got the revenge. The mind has a way of getting away on you. I don't know what happened rightly. That's what happens when you're cranking it. Hardly know the visions from the reality. But I did know I had to get to the woods and get gone, or I was gonna have a fate worser than Tally Briscoe. Revenge makes you sick, like all's you can think about or imagine is killing or torturing and getting that vengeance. But once it's done, you got to think and live with what was done to make your 'venge in the first place. And then that 'venge ain't there to make you feel good or anything no more. It is my daddy, D. Ray White, that gave me this life, and near the only good in it has been his doing. I tried to think what he'd have done in my place right then. Well, he'd have give himself up and told the police everything and do what's good and blessed. And I should have done that too, but I'm a weak man. He'd be heartbroken, that's sure. I still think on him, though, and I miss him, because I love my daddy and will till the day I die. Them bugs was always on me and driving me to distraction. I was there in them woods about two days before I figured I had to get somewhere else. I got to thinking that old Edgar Hudd had a cabin that was way out, and nobody went out there except Daddy, and that is only for hunting. I lit out then and there for old Hudd's cabin over by Septon's Rise. Hood will be 90 if he's a day. I was not sure at all if I would find him there alive. None had seen him around for about a year. Jessie boy. Been a time. I hear that you dance just like Ray now over at Twilight and Bandytown. But look at you, boy. Now, you real ragged. You get a jar of that water down you right now. Took me near on three day to get here. I can't do that trek no more. But no need, neither. But don't try fooling me, boy, because I know you got trouble. When you come in, I could smell a reek like dead squirrel. I know about your evil, Jesco White. Well, Edgar, I won't lie to you. I'm hiding out on account of the fact that I sorted out Davie and Long for what they done to Daddy. And them police is after me now, so's I come up here to hide out. I don't want no trouble for you all, though. And if you can see your way clear to set me up with some food and just let me rest a piece, then I'll be gone. Liar's what you are, boy. You're weak. You was never enough man to 'venge your Daddy's death. Old Davie and Long happy as can be, living a life on the other side of that mountain. Lord will take care of them in his own sweet time. Excepting now you, in your anger and vengeance, has taken the life of one not determined. And that there is blood on your brow, boy. And, oh, it sickens my heart and that of Ray's to see you lie before God. Boy, you done some bad things in your life, and no amount of crying's going to change it. You was always coming here, Jess. I always said you'd turn out wrong. And here you are, a killer. And at some point comes the retribution of the just. Now, Jesus was made to walk on broken ground. His body gutted and his breath stole from this Earth the unholy deeds. Them that was left got to live by the laws set down by God. Iffen you'd been man enough to get Davie and Long, you'd have sure speeded them on their journey to hell where they'll burn for eternity. But this killing Reilly is a killing against Jesus, the Lord who died for us. And His will got to be done against the man what done this wrong. Please, Lord, save me. I accept Jesus into my body. Jesus, save me. I accept Jesus into my body. I accept Jesus into my body. Now, I don't know how long that fight lasted 'tween the good Lord and the devil. But when I came out of it, I was nearly done myself. I understand now that it weren't Edgar at all that I was talking to then. I see it as God a-talking to me, telling me sense. I could still hear old Edgar's voice days after I put him down there in the ground, the voice of God telling me things direct. And I knew what I had to do to clean them sins away. The Bible is what tells us everything that we need in life and death. Its pages are the messages to the people from God. Hell on Earth so's eternity can be spent in the heavens. Turmoil and torment. 40 years of suffering to rid yourself of the devil's taint. Jesus is the Son of God. He could make miracles and feed the people with fish and bread, multiplying the numbers with the skin of his holy body. ♪ Who saved a wretch ♪ I understand my punishment now, though, how to cleanse away them bad, what course through my veins, God tell me. ♪ I once was lost ♪ Flesh is impure, must be bled or boiled.

When I take it into me, my new good soul clears it of its bad and takes it to remake myself in a better image. The bad what's left is shit out and buried, and the whole area then is prayed over and set to flame. I knew then I was right. I was on the course of Jesus. When I got done with my toes, then go my ears and this liar's tongue.
