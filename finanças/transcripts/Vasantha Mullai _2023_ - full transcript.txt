[On radio] 'Hi! Hello! Welcome everyone!' 'This is RJ Anandhi here from Suryan FM 93.5' 'After your busy schedule at school or work...' 'you must be heading home but stuck in traffic' 'I just entered the studio but still...' 'to make your journey back home a pleasant one...' 'I have queued up awesome songs' 'Before that I have something important to discuss with you all' 'Guess what is that about?' 'Sleep' "Stop talking about sleep, I haven't reached home yet" "In fact after reaching I still got work" "So stop talking about sleep now" 'You all must feel that way' 'But I have important details about the importance of sleep' [Cell phone rings] 'And you must know them because...' 'on one hand it is important to have a good start to a day...' 'similarly on other hand it is equally important how we end our day' Tell me. [Nila] 'Where are you, Rudra?' On my way. 'For the past half an hour you're giving the same reply?' 'After a long time his highness gave me an appointment on birthday.' 'Even today you're late' Heavy traffic jam. I'm on my way. 'You take your own time but the movie will start in five minutes.' -'Tell me the truth, where are you?' -Wait, I'll call you back. -'Hello' -Bye. Yeah, Shyam? Rudran, did you see the mail? Shyam, actually I'm driving. Red Cork release is stopped. What? How come, Shyam? They have spotted a bug during staging. And the clients are waiting for the Red Cork release. If it doesn't release today... then you know the consequences. Shyam, just give me a minute. I'll call you back. Bye. [Cell phone rings] I'll call you back! I'm on my way! Stop pestering me! I'm coming. [Line ringing] [Cell phone rings] Tell me, buddy. What happened to the release? Which movie? I'm talking about our project. -It must be live by now. -No! A bug was found during staging and QA has raised it. Release has been blocked. Can you check the bug at once and move it to priority fix for release. -Crap! -[Tires screeching] You fool! Doofus! Rudra... are you asking me to fix the bug? The bug doesn't seem to be in the code. Must be a deployment bug. Can you check if the DB script was executed properly and call me back? Okay. -Dude, make it fast. -Okay. Okay. Bye. Okay, sir. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. [Cell phone rings] [Nila] 'I'm leaving.' I reached. -'Seriously, I am...' -I reached! Where are you? 'Where are you, Rudra?' Turn around. [Whistles] Heavy traffic. Please understand. Look, I'm here now. Sorry, dear. Popcorn? Caramel flavour? Cold coffee? Cold coffee? [Cell phone rings] Sorry! Sorry! Please. [Cell phone rings] Tell me, dude. Did you go and meet him? He will say so. Just butter him up and get the work done. Mani said he'd join for the movie with his friends. He is yet to arrive. -He'll bring Dinesh along. -Excuse me. -Fine. -Excuse me! -Please step out and talk. -Hold on. Wait. -You're disturbing us. -Wait, I'll call you back. I'll call you back -Sorry. -Have some decency. -Sorry ma'am. -Leave it. It must be some important call. Let's watch the movie. Hang up. I'll call you back. [Phone vibrating] Crap! Shyam... -Rudran, what's the update? -We are working on it. You've been saying the same for half an hour. It will be done in few minutes. Bro... Please step out and talk. -We also want to watch the movie. -Please... Please... We too are getting disturbed. Okay. Yeah. Bye. -Sorry, brother. -To hell with your sorry. [Phone chimes] [Audience laughing] Dude, what happened? Rudra, we executed the DB script. But a new error... error 501 showed up. Come on, bro. Step out and talk. We are unable to watch the movie. Excuse me, madam! Will you only teach us the rules? Excuse me! Now don't you have any decency? Come on, we also want to watch the movie. Excuse me, madam! Hello, brother! -Come on, brother. You can't just keep doing it... -Hey! Please. Sit down. Rudra, no. [Audience cheering] [Phone vibrating] Just one call. I'll be back in a minute. -Why so late? -Heavy traffic, buddy. Look at that guy. Call me immediately. Okay? [Phone chimes] [Phone vibrating] Are you showing off in front of your girlfriend? How dare you shout at me? Why are you standing quiet like a statue now? Now, talk! Damn it! He's so weak. One blow and he fainted. How about I put him on the potty? Forget that dummy. Let's go. -Come, let's go. -You guys go. I'll come. [Groans] Hello. Shut and leave. Come again. Shut the tap and leave. Are you playing with me? Was that beating not enough? I'll crack the other side of the jaw too. How dare you stare at me? [Phone vibrating] Mummy! 'What are you even doing?' 'Even the API call has been authorized!' 'Doesn't seem like Red Cork will release' API call authorization is your job not ours! Just keep the phone! Are you okay, sir? Yeah. Thank you. Rudra? Rudra, what happened? Rudra! Rudra, what happened? Rudra? Rudra? Okay guys... let me cut to the chase. As you all know... Our company's prime project- Red Cork... needs an acting project manager. Red Cork is our company's prime project. We must release this project in six months. If we complete it successfully in the stipulated time... Well... you could even become a permanent project manager. And why not? You could also become our company's PM or director. You'll be paid in lakhs... and in the form of company shares too. In the given timeline, I guess... Santhosh can pull this off, Shyam. Santhosh? Would you like to take this up? I would love to, sir. Completing it in 180 days is a challenge but... I'll take it up, Shyam. You sure, Rudran? I'll finish it off in 150 days. Rudran... take some time and let us know Because... If you fail to finish it before the deadline. You will have to face the consequences. I hope you understand that, Rudran. Yes, Shyam. I'll take it. [Alarm ringing] [Music] "Do it! Do it! It's your duty!" "There is a long way to go, don't rest your eyes yet" "Do it! Do it! It's your duty!" "You won't even have time to lift your head!" "Like the needle stuck inside the clock" "Just keep repeating the same routine" "Don't care about others and keep moving" "Be on your toes until the work is over" "I won't give up! I won't give up!" "Until I am victorious" "I won't give up! I won't give up!" "Until I am victorious" "Do it! Do it! " "Run! Run!" "Do it! Do it! " "Run! Run!" "Do it... Do it... " "Do it! Do it! " "Run! Run!" "You have a dream..." "but time's so tight that it looks unachievable" "As you progress, you keep gasping" "As the dream keep chasing and threatening you" "No one is by your side..." "Dreams that unexpectedly push you to the edge" "Keep fighting as if today is the last day" "Still he won't give up, no matter what" "As your duty drains you out..." "Your responses result in increasing your burden" "He's pushing himself to edge of his life but for what?" "As he keeps running without any rest" "Now day and night are no different" "Even love and friendship are ignored" "He won't rest until he is victorious" "So come on!" "Your goal has tied you up" "You go nothing to lose" "Overcome your fear and you'll see no one can win you" "Yes, absolutely no one!" "Who needs sleep?" "Victory is not far away" "Forget everything and run for your future" "There's no time to waste" "This never ending night is here to stay" "When will the good times come?" "Without any rest, your body..." "is burning like a fire" "This never ending night is here to stay" "When will the good times come?" "Without any rest, your body..." "is burning like a fire" [Music] "Drain yourself out to achieve your goal" "You'll lose yourself by the time your task is over" "This is never ending, it'll keep chasing you" "But you're determined to finish it even without rest" "So you keep running tirelessly" "Poor hard working guy is ruining himself" "Whatever strength is left inside you keeps fighting" "Before you lose yourself..." "Do it! Do it!" "Do it! Do it! Keep doing it!" "Do it! Do it!" "Do it! Do it! Keep doing it!" [Music] [Phone vibrating] [Phone rings] Hello. Excuse me. You guys may go in. So... Mr. Rudran... how many hours do you sleep in a day? When did you sleep last? Doctor... it's been four to five months since he has some proper sleep Four to five months? What's so important that it doesn't let you sleep? He works in a software company, doctor. IT! Do you work on the machine... or you work as the machine itself? You got this problem because you stressed your mind and body beyond limits. A normal human being need seven to eight hours of sleep per day. And if you don't sleep and stress your brain beyond limits... it goes into rest mode on it's own without your permission. Let's pause this topic about sleep. If I am not wrong... I think you do a lot of multi tasking at work. Am I right? See... Everyone does multi tasking these days. We listen to music while reading news and drinking coffee. Few of them do all these while driving a car. When it crosses the limit... the brain will start to panic. That's what has happened in your case. This is called "Blackout". Work is just a part of our lives. But health? That's what our whole life is all about. All you need now... is only this. I'll give you some basic medication. But to top it all... forget your work for a while and... take a break. Take him some place nice to forget this stressful life. Get some fresh air. [Phone vibrating] Most important thing... throw this away before you go. Can't you understand? To hell with this work! Quit it and come. Quit it? Then how will we earn our bread and butter? Nila, listen to me. We will go after I finish my work. What's wrong with you? Why are you such a workaholic without any sleep and peace of mind. Is your work more important than me? Why are you running like this? Stop yelling and pestering me. Can't you just understand? Keeps shouting and irritating me. [Nila sobbing] Nila... look at me. Nila, I want to make a fortune. I want to settle down quickly. I want to take good care of you. Even better than your dad takes care of you. This project is like... my biggest opportunity. I want to materialize it. Please. Try to understand. Rudra, do you think money will make me happy? I have seen enough luxuries and riches since childhood. Happiness does lie in it. The moment my dad went after money... me and my dad lost the attachment between us. I used to yearn for a moment with him. Then you came in my life... and gave me lot of happiness. Just when I thought you are my future... you're also detaching from me. [Crying] I didn't fall in love with the Rudran who is a workaholic. I fell in love... with the Rudran who gave me those little sweet moments all the time. I want that Rudran... and want to spend the rest of my life with him. [Crying] [Cell phone rings] Tell me. Shyam is furious! Where are you? Tell him I am on my way. [Cell phone rings] [Horn honking] [Cell phone rings] [Crying] You said you're taking me somewhere. Aren't you ready yet? [Music] "The love clouds are pouring down upon us" "Let's set out a romantic journey" "Sky is our limit..." "so let's fly like birds" "The world is so colourful when I am with you" "My heart jumps in joy when I am around you" "Even after our eyes finish talking..." "our hearts still keep asking for more" "My heart breaks when you're not by my side" "I want you always by my side, because you are my happiness" "My heart breaks when you're not by my side" "I want you always by my side, because you are my happiness" [Music] "A beauty like the thousand rainbows..." "sleeps right next to me like a baby" "She lights up my world and showers it with love" "My days and journey are filled with love" [Music] "When you are by my side..." "I lose myself and turn into a happy kid" "When I rest my head on your shoulders, I understand where my whole world lies" "Even the rain is beautiful only when you are with me" "My heart breaks when you're not by my side" "I want you always by my side, because you are my happiness" [Music] [Clouds rumbling] -There's a pharmacy. -Yeah. Asthalin 200, right? Yup. Where are you going? -Washroom. -Okay. How much? Rs. 140 Excuse me! -Got it. -I'll drive. Okay. [Engine starts] What is it? Please open it for me. Give that to me. Keep it inside. Baby, nothing to worry! I'll get down and check. Okay? -I'll check. Okay? -Rudra... Relax... Relax... -Wait, I'll check. -Rudra, no need. Just relax. -Rudra. -Nothing to worry. You be seated. -What happened? -Nothing to worry. Relax. Nila... Look at me. Look, nothing to worry. -I'll take care of this. Okay? -Rudra... Nothing to worry. -[Thunder rumbling] -Relax! Nothing to worry. -What's that Rudra? -Come, let's leave this place at once. Come! Come! Come on... Come... Fast.. Fast... Sit. Nila... why are you still tensed? Some animal crossing the road must have hit the car. Nothing would have happened. Relax. Okay. Stop the car. What happened? Let's stay here tonight... and leave tomorrow morning. We'll reach the town in 30-40 kilometers. We will find a better hotel there. No. It's late night. You also need rest. Let's stay here tonight and leave in the morning. Okay. Vasantha Mullai Are you sure about this place? Okay. Fine, let me check if rooms are available. My wallet... Give me my wallet. Hello! Anybody in here? [Calling bell ringing] Hello! Yes, dear?

Give me an ID card of yours. Damn... Now what's happening? The printer is faulty. Shall I return it in the morning? Okay. Madam looks upset. Why so? We met with a small accident on our way here. An accident? Oh God! Hope you both are fine. Well, something hit our car... but when I got down, I saw nothing. Oh, is it? Well, there is a river nearby. Deers often come this way to drink water over there. It must be some deer crossing the road, that must have hit your car. That's all. Heard that? She got scared unnecessarily. [Laughs] This is quite usual here, dear. The forest department even built a fence... but in vain. Come on. Let's go upstairs. Come. Sir... Are you all by yourself here? Nobody else in here? It's the off season, dear. Staffs left to home after finishing their duties. They will come only tomorrow morning. Only I and an old lady stay here. Come in. Okay, dear. Call me if you need anything. Okay, sir. I'm keeping the key here. You heard what he said. Just relax. Nothing would have gone wrong. Okay? Relax. [Window rumbling] What happened? Nothing. Two minutes. I'll be back.

[Gunshot] Rudra... Clear! Clear! Clear! -Sister, get the crash guard. -Yes, sir. Gel please. -On the blades. -Sir. Clear! Sir, he's not responding. Clear! Clear! Relax... Relax... He'll be fine -Monitor him. -Okay, doctor. -Check his vitals and update. -Okay, sir. Sister, keep a watch on his vitals. Sure, sir. -SP02? -It's 75. Sir! What are you doing?

Nila... -Nila... -Rudra... -Call the doctor. -Okay. -Rudra.... -Are you alright? -Are you alright? -Yes, I'm fine. -You are safe! -Yes, I am okay. -Really? You're okay, right? -I'm okay. Trust me. -You're fine, right? -Lie down. Sedate him. Bharath, he's getting hyped when he sees you. Okay, doctor. I'm saying this as a doctor and not your husband. You sleep. I'll reach home late. I want Rudran's all previous records. -Very urgent. Okay? -Sure, doctor. Doctor, why is Rudran behaving like that? This is Mr. Bharath. He's the one who brought Rudra to the hospital. How did it happen? He was racing down the road in his car, on the opposite side. We were taken by surprise. That led to the accident. I suddenly had a wheezing attack after checking into a hotel. He took the car to rush to the pharmacy. But he didn't return at all. I was waiting for him. But by then... [Crying] What was he saying about your child? Is it painful? I am scared. Don't be. I am here for you. That uncle? He is fine. Look... This aunty... is here to take care of that uncle. Take half tablet. Please. Why is Rudran behaving like this? I am really worried, doctor Don't worry I went through Rudran's medical history He shouldn't be driving in this condition The pressure to buy an inhaler for you... made Rudran drive the car faster. Just before the accident... he must have blacked out Yes! The biggest mystery in this world that nobody can crack is... the human brain. As he drove, he saw him and his child coming in the opposite... and during the accident Rudran went unconscious. Then his brain started playing with him. The guilt of having killed his daughter... is what he must be having. He is stuck in his own world. He is stuck in a world of his own [Thunder rumbling] Excuse me! Looking for a room? Even after high dosage of sedation... he just doesn't sleep! His body is in the state of rest... but his brain? It's hyperactive If he doesn't sleep properly even now It will definitely lead to further complications [Sobbing] I am worried. The doctor is talking crazy. I am really scared. Nothing has happened to me. I am right here, with you. Relax... please. Nothing will happen to that kid. Relax Rudra. Please sleep, Rudra. Sleep. I am right next to you. Relax Rudra. Relax... Relax... Sleep. Relax Relax. Relax. Relax. Are you okay? Then how did you manage without the inhaler? Inhaler was under the cot You didn't notice it in a hurry I'm sorry It's much better now. Medicines can heal these bruises. But your depression... can only be cured gradually. If you listen to me, you'll be alright very soon. Okay? Some special guest is waiting for you. Meet them only if you are comfortable. -Hello. Hi. -Hello. Hi. -Hi. -Laya... Do you believe it now? Uncle's perfectly fine. Laya is still in that trauma. I am sorry, dear. I heard the doctor say that you aren't sleeping properly. A sleep without any stress and tension is the best medicine for our body. We all set alarm for waking up... but do any of us set the alarm to go to sleep on time? Sleep is very important, brother Take care -See you. -Bye. -[Cell phone rings] -Bye. Can I attend it? Yeah Shyam? Hello Rudran. Happy married life man. Thank you so much, Shyam. Red Cork project is a super hit! Despite the delays, the client is very happy. The management is highly impressed with your work. Thank you, Shyam. And here's some fantastic news. Management and the client... wants you to handle the upcoming two high priority projects!

Thank you so much and... I will call you back. Bye. To hell with the project! -Bye. -Bye. Hey see this one.
