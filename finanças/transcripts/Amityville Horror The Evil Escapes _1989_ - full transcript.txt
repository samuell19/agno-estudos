(Multicom Jingle) (slow ominous music) (ominous music) - If you don't mind, I'll stay out here, Father. - I don't mind, don't blame you. (suspenseful music) (flies buzz) (man clears throat) - Father. - Father, be so kind. (high-pitched suspenseful music) - [Father] Hurry, hurry now! - [Man] Give me a hand with this, quickly. (high-pitched rattling) (men chant in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (flies buzz) (speaks in foreign language) (ominous organ music) (loud banging) (chants in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - [Priest] Bless this house and all who live in it. (speaks in foreign language) (flies buzz) (speaks in foreign language) (loud hissing) (high-pitched suspenseful music) (hard thump) (high-pitched suspenseful music) (monitor beeps) - Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou, amen. (monitor beeps) (children chatter) - [Girl] So this is the same color that's in my room right here. And it's right there, see it's beautiful. And I think that it could... - [Woman] No, honey. - [Girl] Please? - [Man] This lamp here. - [Woman] Does that have an orange sticker on it? (door creaks) - Well, Father? - It's gone. - Are you sure? - The house would not let me stand here otherwise. - Could it be a trick? Maybe it's laying low for now. - Cigna has been known to trick even priests. Lord known he's done it to me more times than I care to admit. But not this time. I just feel it in my bones. He's quit the house. - [Woman] Hey Jack, you should see that nifty little floor lamp over there. - Somewhere there must be a young, handsome artist. - This is so much junk, Helen. We're wasting a perfectly good day. - [Man] Honey, don't run around. Sweetheart, come here. - [Girl] Alright. - [Man] Honey, put that down. (woman laughs) - Rhona. Look at this. (laughs) This is just perfect. (Rhona laughs) - This is ugly. - Yeah, that's why it's perfect. Ah, hundred dollars. Even the price is right. - Helen, you're not gonna buy this, this... - Monstrosity? Of course I am. As a matter of fact, I think I'm gonna give it to my sister as a birthday present. - You think she'll like it? (laughs) - Well I think she'll understand it. (laughs) It's gonna make her laugh. Well that's the point. Our age, things aren't as important as fun. - [Rhona] Will cost you most to ship it than it's worth. - Well I can afford it. Ooh! Damn! Oh, that thing is sharp! Thanks. - Maybe we outta get you a tetanus shot. - Don't worry about it, I'll be fine. (ominous music) (door buzzes) Coming, coming. - [Man] Hi, Postal International? - [Helen] Oh yeah, right here. - [Man] Okay, if you wanna sign line four for me please. - Sure. - That's a nasty looking finger, lady. - At my age, I've had worse. - Hope I don't. Thank you. (ominous instrumental music) (wind chimes jingle) (soft inspirational music) - [Boy] Boy, look at this. It's like living in the country. - [Girl] It is living in the country. Outhouses and wild animals. - [Mom] Very funny. - It's probably five miles from school. - Two miles. I used to ride my bike all the time. - Right, in hail storms with a broken leg. After washing the dishes and mowing the lawn. - That's right. - Hey, here it is! (seagulls squawk) Hey, there's a delivery truck. Is that our stuff, mom? - [Mom] Wrong company. Besides, they told me not to expect it for a week. - [Boy] Wow, house looks bigger than I remember. - [Girl] Looks older, too. - [Mom] It is older. So are you. - [Girl] But I'm not decaying. - [Mom] Not yet. - [Boy] Look, there's Grandma. - [Mom] Okay you guys, be nice. - [Boy] Hi Grandma! - Oh, Brian. Oh, you've grown. I swear, you're going to take after your grandfather's side of the family. Oh, good trip? - Piece of cake. Hi Mom. - Good to see you. Amanda, welcome. - [Amanda] Hi Grandma. - And Jessica. Oh come, give me a hug. (seagulls squawk) Come on, Jessica. Oh, that's right. Oh that's good. - Will I have to share a room, Grandma? - No one will have to share, I've got it all worked out. - [Mom] What'd you buy, Mom? - Oh I didn't. It's a gift from your aunt Helen. I'm sure it's another one of her little jokes. - [Brian] Looks like a pretty big joke to me. (Grandma laughs) - [Grandma] Just put it in the living room to your right. (seagulls squawk) Well thank you. Thank you very much. (bird squawks) - Hey look, Grandma got a bird! - Oh you remember Fred. Oh no no you wouldn't. I got him since you were here last. That would be two years. - [Brian] Can he speak? - He can say pretty bird. Maybe while you're here you can teach him a few words. (playful suspenseful music) - [Amanda] Can I see my room, Grandma? - Upstairs, third door on the left. Brian will be across the way. - [Brian] Pretty bird, pretty bird. - You have Jessica next to me, right Mom? - Oh yeah. - Open the present, Grandma. - Do you think it might be something really special? - Yeah, I do. - Alright then, let's find out. Brian, fetch me a sharp knife from the kitchen. You'll find it in the drawer to the right of the sink. Now what can that be? (cat meows) - Pepper. (cat meows) How are you? You remember me? Huh, kitty? Remember when me and Dad took that thorn out of your paw? (cat purrs) - Aunt Helen must have money to burn sending something this big all the way from Long Island. Maybe the joke's on her this time. It has the look of a genuine antique. - Mother, it's as ugly as sin. (bird squawks) You see? Even Fred agrees with me. - You know lit up, it's rather interesting. (bird squawks) - Hey, look who I found. - Pepper! (cat groans) (Amanda screams) (cat hisses) - Oh honey, are you alright? - Why, she's never behaved like that. - [Brian] You were squeezing her. - Was not. - [Brian] Were too. - Alright, alright. (bird squawks) - [Brian] Pepper, kitty. - She probably just agrees with Fred and me about that lamp. Well honey, you better wash it out. Mom, do you have any peroxide or anything upstairs? - [Grandma] In my medicine chest. (slow playful music) (waves crash loudly) - I know it's been a long time since you've had your house invaded like this, Mom. I really didn't know what else to do. Frank's life insurance money was dwindling away on living expenses. This way I'll have a fighting chance. In a year I'll have my teaching credentials and enough income to support a mortgage. - Well I hope you got a good rental fee for the house. - Enough to cut the carrying costs. Amazing, isn't it? The words carrying costs seven months ago were a foreign language to me. 18 years of marital shelter, gone in one gasp. - Well it does seem a shame that Frank would leave you in such a state. - That's not what I meant. - Well I'm simply pointing out that... - I know what you're pointing out. Mom, I came home because I needed help, not criticism. I know how you felt about Frank. But I had 18 incredible years with him. Three wonderful kids. The man dropped dead at 42, do you think he planned it? - Now don't be rude. - I'm sorry, but expecting to live beyond 42 years is neither unreasonable nor immoral. Well if there's any fault here, it's mine. For not making myself better prepared to earn a living. - Well it was your choice to quit college. - I know that. Could we just get past the 20 year old arguments, please? My problem right now is Jessica. - Well she seems quite fine to me. But Amanda. I mean that makeup and those clothes. And Brian's hair. Now what sort of haircut is that? - Mom, they're perfectly normal, healthy kids. That's superficial, it doesn't mean anything. - Maybe it should. - I have a daughter who talks as if her father is still alive. That's a problem. She's regressed. She's an 11-year-old behaving like a five-year-old. - Time and a new environment. - Yeah, I hope so. (ominous instrumental music) (bird squawks) (loud high-pitched music) (bird squawks) (high-pitched ominous music) (loud hiss) - Oh, must be some kind of power surge. (kettle hisses) (radio sings) - What? - That was our song. Frank's and mine. (radio sings) - More tea? - No thanks. Maybe that's Frank's way of welcoming us. Maybe he thinks this is a good idea. - Just a coincidence, that's all. (loud hiss) Ow! - Mom. - [Grandma] Oh! - Let me see. Oh mom, that's bad. - Well I've seen worse, but I better put some aloe on it. (radio sings) - How could that happen? - Pretty bird? Pretty bird? Oh come on, Fred. What's wrong with you tonight? Oh are there too many people around? Are they upsetting you? Oh, goodnight then. See you in the sunshine. Oh, Helen, Helen. (harpsichord music) (slow ominous music) (loud gasp) - Honey, you startled me. You know you're supposed to knock. - Can I sleep with you? - Now Jessica, we have talked about this before. You're a big girl now. - But I'm scared in there all by myself. - Alright, since it's a new room for you. But just for tonight. Okay? (slow ominous music) Jessica. - [Jessica] We got a flat tire on the freeway and Mom had to pull over on the side of the road. (high-pitched ominous music) We had the spare, but that was flat too. Had to wait for over an hour for (mumbles). (high-pitched ominous music) And another for the tow truck to come and change the tire. And then we stopped to get something to eat. Where I had a burger with fries and some chocolate milk. Then we started driving again. But Brian got carsick. But Mommy couldn't stop on the freeway. So he got sick. All over the car. (quiet ominous music) Mommy, you scared him! - Scared who? - He's gone. (slow serene music) - Jessie, there's nobody here. - [Jessica] Daddy was here. - Daddy's not here. - He was, I talked to him. - It was a dream. - No, it was him. - I had a dream too. And it seemed very real, but it wasn't. And neither was yours. (slow serene music) Jessie, Daddy's gone. And he can't ever come back. - It was him! (slow ominous music) (loud flies buzzing) (seagulls squawk) - Mom? My blue sweater's all wrinkled from packing. Can I wear yours? - Can't you wear something else today? - I wanna wear blue today. What's wrong with her? - I don't know yet. 101.2. Well, no school for you today. - Lucky. - Amanda. - I'm just kidding. - I saw Daddy last night. - It was a dream. No wonder. Her fever probably already started. - Look, don't say stuff like that, okay? - I did see him. - Just stop it. - Amanda, she's sick. - Mom, I don't care if she's sick. I don't want her talking like that. - Why don't you just take the sweater, okay? It's in my closet. And hurry up about it. Jessie, she misses Daddy too. It hurts her when you say things like that. - Yoo hoo, Mrs. Leacock, I'm here. - [Grandma] In the kitchen. (phone rings) Hi Peggy. - Where did that lamp come from? - [Grandma] My sister. I'm trying to call to thank her but she must have gone out early. - You wanna thank her for that? - [Grandma] Don't you like it? - I s'pose you're gonna tell me it's a valuable antique. - Would you like it any better? - I'd like it less. It'd mean we were stuck with it. (Grandma chuckles) What did you do to your hand? - Oh there's something wrong with that electric kettle. - Oh well I'll call Walt Reed. - Hey, Peggy. - Oh Nancy, it's so good to see you. - It's good to see you. - Good to have you home. - Tell me that after you've seen my three monsters. - Ooh, I think I'll just go stir them out of bed. - Good. - Coffee's hot. - Mom, I have a problem. Jessica has a fever. - Do you want the doctor? - No no no, it's nothing that serious. It's just that I will probably have to leave her home today. - Peggy and I can look after her, it's no problem. - Thanks, Mom. I had hoped I wouldn't be disrupting your life too much and here I go on day one. (cat meows) - [Grandma] Oh, morning Brian. - Morning Grandma. What's for breakfast? - Well I guess I can scramble up a few eggs. - I'll scramble the eggs. - Well the rolls are in the freezer. I'll warm up the oven. (high-pitched ominous music) (suspenseful music) - Good morning, Fred. (ominous music) (bell dings) - Brian, the oven's ready. (suspenseful music) (cat moews) (loud gasp) Oh, Mom. (suspenseful music) (loud gasp) Oh! Oh. - [Woman] Hey I gotta go to class, I'll see ya. (birds chirp) - [Guy] Can you come now? - [Girl] Yeah, yeah. - You guys alright? - I get the feeling Grandma thinks what happened today was our fault. - Oh how can you say that? She took responsibility for leaving Fred's cage unlocked. - I know but it was awfully frosty in that house. - She's upset, Amanda. Just the way you're upset about your first day in a new school. That can make people frosty, right? Hey hey hey. Don't I get a kiss? You'll knock 'em dead, sweetheart. - See ya at dinner. Let's go, Brian. - You okay? - Yeah, I guess. But will Grandma be okay? - Don't you worry. Grandma will be just fine. I'll bet you in a week she'll have another bird in that cage. - Yeah, but it won't be Fred. - No, it won't be Fred. - I just wish things could come back. - Me too. Bye, honey. - Bye Mom. (teens chattering) - [Man] And well, he hasn't come since. I'm sure he's dropped. (clock ticks) - I'll move that into the attic. - How could I have made such an awful mistake? I could've sworn this door was closed last night. - Yeah, don't make yourself sick over this. - Oh Peggy, I've lived alone so long, I've... I'm not sure I can handle all this commotion. (clock ticks) (ominous music) - I should have prepared you better for what was to happen. Lord knows I've had my share of confrontations with the evil in that house. It was not a mission to be offered without complete forewarning. I blame myself for this. - [Woman] Dr. White, report to oncology. - I spoke to the monseigneur. He thinks it best you return to the monastery. - Would you take me back to that house? - I don't think that's wise, Dennis. - You told me the house was safe now. (ominous music) The furniture's gone? - [Man] I sold it off. - [Dennis] All of it? - Whatever didn't sell went to the junkyard. (ominous music) - There was a, a standing lamp in this room. What happened to it? - Sold or junk. - Would anyone have a record? - I would. - I need a name and phone number. (ominous music) - Lieutenant Strudella? This is Father Manfred. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Lieutenant, I need a favor. I have the phone number of a woman who needs my help. But she's not answering. And I'm worried. I don't have her address. I wonder if you could get it for me if I gave you her phone number and her name. Oh thank you. Helen Royce. Five five five, two, three, four, one. Thank you. Oh I appreciate that. Tomorrow morning will be fine. Thank you. You know, this could be an overreaction on both our parts. - [Dennis] I hope so. But I don't think you believe that. - A dozen years ago, evil was simply a concept in my mind. That house in Amityville has changed that concept to reality forever. For 300 years, no one has lived on that ground without tragic consequences. As recently as 1974, a boy murdered his entire family because the voices in the house told him to do it. A dozen years ago I would've thought that what you saw in that lamp was an hallucination brought on by fear. Now, now I believe that the evil in that house could transmigrate into that lamp. That it can and will transmigrate into another object. Or another house. Or another person at the earliest opportunity. (clock ticks) (ominous music) (cat meows) (suspenseful music) (cat meows) (suspenseful music) - Pepper. (suspenseful music) Pepper, here kitty kitty kitty. You down here? (suspenseful music) (cat meows) Geez, Pepper. What are you doing over here? (cat meows) Here. Hey. (suspenseful music) Geez, look at all this stuff, huh? (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (Brian mimics chainsaw) (chainsaw roars loudly) Whoa! (suspenseful music) - Peggy, what in the world in the basement? (chainsaw roars loudly) - [Brian] Oh my God, stop! (chainsaw roars loudly) (glass shatters) (chainsaw roars loudly) Help! (suspenseful music) - Stop, stop! Stop it! - Brian, shut it off! - I can't! - [Peggy] Brian! - [Grandma] Brian! (chainsaw roars loudly) - [Amanda] Brian! Brian, stop it! (chainsaw roars loudly) Tell me what's wrong with you! (chainsaw roars loudly) (loud metal sawing) (ominous music) (frantic gasps) (eerie violin music) - Are you crazy? - It started by itself! - You switched it on. - No, I didn't! - Brian, don't you lie to me. - I'm not lying, Grandma. It started by itself. I was pretending to use it and it just started by itself. - [Grandma] It can't start by itself. - What is going on down here? - Mom, mom it started by itself. Honest. - Nancy, you know how I feel about lying. I mean, a mistake is human. But to lie is the devil's work. - Brian doesn't lie. - [Grandma] But how do you explain all this? - I don't know, Mother. But I don't begin by calling my grandson a liar. Amanda. - I'll have Walt Reed come by and take a look at that saw. And the kettle. And then that old lamp. It's been doing funny things lately. (crickets chirp) (clock ticks) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - Hi. - [Mom] Can't sleep? - [Amanda] Mm mm. What are you reading? - Oh I figured I'd do something constructive with my insomnia. The old brain cells have been rusting for 20 years. - Resting, mom. Not rusting. - I hope so. (clock ticks) - Do you feel comfortable here? - This is where I grew up. - I feel like we're intruders. She doesn't really want us here. It's just kind of her obligation as your mother. - Sounds accurate. Despite all of that. She really does love us. We just have to get used to her ways. Her rules. - She was wrong about Brian. - Yeah. I think she knows that now. - Don't you think she should apologize? - My mother? That's one of her ways you're gonna have to get used to. (clock ticks) She'll take care of Brian in her own way. (clock ticks) School tomorrow. Let's hit the hay. Did you meet any cute boys in school? - [Amanda] In this town? Give me a break. - [Mom] How many? - [Amanda] A couple. Maybe three. (mom laughs) (clock ticks) (door buzzes) - Can I help you? - I'm looking for Mrs. Helen Royce. - She's not in. - Do you have any idea what time she'll be back? - Maybe I could help. I live next door. - It's personal. I really need to talk to her. - She's in the hospital. (nurses chatting) (monitor beeps) - [Nurse] Can't just sit here. (monitor beeps) ICU. - [Dennis] Do you know what caused this? - [Doctor] Tetanus. We rarely see cases like this anymore now with toxoid and antibody inoculations. But that's what she's got. Our antibiotics don't seem to be helping much. - But where did the tetanus come from? - The infected finger. She cut it on an old lamp. (monitor beeps) - [Woman] Nurse Blessing, you're wanted in obstetrics. - [Man] Thank you, nurse. - [Woman] You're wanted in-- - [Priest] You know anything about an old brass lamp that Mrs. Royce purchased last week? - Well I was with her when she bought it. - Is it in her house? - No, she sent it to her sister in California. - Do you know the sister's name? - And her phone number. But I've been trying to contact her for days to let her know about Helen. No one answers. - [Woman] Dr. Reeves, please see the new treatment. - Let me have her phone number. - Hi. - Hi. - That's Brian's favorite. - Yes, I know. - Can I help? - Sure. (phone rings) Hello? Hello. (flat dial tone) Oh, that's the third time today. Gonna have to get that phone company out here. (phone rings) - [Man] Yes, it's just down at the end of the hall. - Well I'll try again later. (doorbell rings) - Hi. Reed Electric. - Hi. Come in. - Hi, Danny. Oh where's your dad? - Oh he just said come by, get the appliances and take them back to the shop. - Oh well the chainsaw's in the basement and the kettle's in the kitchen. Oh Danny, this is Mrs. Leacock's granddaughter, Amanda. Amanda, this is Danny Reed. - Hi. - Hi. - [Danny] So where can I find the chainsaw? - Oh would you show him the basement? - Sure. (seagulls squawk) - [Danny] Oh hi, Mrs. Leacock. - Oh hello, Danny. That kettle you want is right here. - Okay, I'll go get the chainsaw first. - There's the basement. - Danny, before you go. Mrs. Leacock, do you think that lamp needs anymore time in the living room? - Alright, store it. - Oh, thank you. Danny, would you lend me a hand please? - Sure. - Amanda, would you be a dear and clean up this mess for me? I feel I need a nap before dinner. - Sure. - [Grandma] Thank you. (seagulls squawk) - [Peggy] Easy now. Careful turning that corner. (seagulls squawk) There, that's got it. - [Danny] I can see why you wanna store this sucker. It's a definite Fort Bagger. - [Peggy] Well if that means ugly, you've got taste. (Danny chuckles) Careful that door jam. Good, good. Oh, this is a heavy son of a gun. - You want it plugged in or anything? - Oh no, nevermind. I think there's something wrong with it anyway. - Really? So why hang onto it? Hey you know, I'd get a few bucks for this down at the junkyard. - Well you just give me a couple of weeks til Mrs. Leacock forgets it and I will gladly give it to you. - Alright, you got a deal. - What'd you think of Amanda, huh? - [Danny] I think she's cute. (Peggy laughs) - [Peggy] Well, gee there's not very many people here, you know. (ominous music) (garbage disposal hums loudly) (loud ominous music) (garbage disposal hums) (suspenseful music) - Hey. Having a problem? - Something's jamming the blades. - Here, take your hand out. You know you shouldn't mess with the disposal unless you've secured the switch. - I've seen you at school. You're a senior? - Yeah. And you're a junior, right? - Uh huh. - [Danny] Where you from? - San Francisco. - Mm, big city, huh? - Yeah. So is there anything to do around here? (ominous music) - Bowling. (ominous music) - Bowling's okay. - Yeah, you definitely got something jammed down here. (suspenseful music) (Danny screams) (Amanda screams) (loud frantic screams) (crickets chirp) - [Nancy] Mom. - They stopped the bleeding. He'll live. (quiet sobs) I just don't understand what's happening around here. How can machines turn on by themselves? It's just not possible. - There has to be a logical explanation. Mr. Reed said he'd be here first thing in the morning. I'm sure he'll understand it. Look, in the meantime, we shouldn't use any electrical appliances. I've already told the kids. (phone rings) Hello? Hello? Hello? (flat dial tone) (phone rings) - Father Kibbler. She's awake. (ominous music) (monitor beeps) - Helen. This is Father Kibbler. - Oh Father, Father. Oh my God. I'm heartly sorry for having offended thee. I detest all my sins. (loud gasp) (monitor beeps rapidly) - [Father Kibbler] Get the nurse. (monitor flatlines) (ominous music) - Saints of God, come to her head. Come to meet her, angels of the Lord. Receive her spirit which is entered to God the most high. So I sent a telegram to her sister. But I doubt she'll get it. - It's possible this woman is away on a vacation somewhere. - I hope to God she is. And that lamp is sitting in a warehouse somewhere. But what if it isn't? What if that woman is in grave danger right this minute? - We could contact the police, have them visit the house. - On what basis? A satanic force has taken possession of a lamp? - You wanna go, is that it? - I have to go. - Monseigneur won't allow it. Not after what happened to you in Amityville. You should already be on your way back to the monastery. - And hide. That's what I've been doing for the last 10 years Father. That's why I left. It's safe there and it's easy and it keeps me from participating in life. Now you don't expect me to go running back there at the first sign of trouble, do you? - This isn't trouble, Dennis. This is torment. I've been through it. - Yeah, so have I. But from the seminary to now, this is the only experience I've had that I can offer to anyone. And I think Alice Leacock may need it. - What do you want from me? - Help me convince the Monseigneur. (clock ticks) Thank you. It's almost 11 o'clock on the west coast. May I use your phone, try to call them again? - Go ahead. (phone rings) (ominous instrumental music) (phone rings) (ominous instrumental music) (phone rings) - Still no answer. (phone rings) (phone rings) Hello? Hello? - [Demon] Stay away, priest! (priest screams) (ominous music) - [Father Manfred] My God. (ominous music) (crickets chirp) (ominous music) (Jessica giggles) (suspenseful music) - [Jessica] Do you wanna talk? Brian was down in the basement and he was playing with a chainsaw. And then it started... (suspenseful music) Everybody said that he did it on purpose but he knew he didn't. And Mom said he didn't also. And all the stuff, this weird stuff has been happening at Grandma's. His hand got stuck to a tea kettle. And she nearly burned off her hand. It was really gross. (suspenseful music) And everything weird has been happening. It's really weird around here. (slow ominous music) - Jessie. - Look Mommy, it's Daddy. (ominous music) - Come on, Jessie. - It's Daddy. - Come on, let's go to bed. - No! - Come on, Jessie. - No! - Jessie, come on! - No! - [Mom] Jessie, stop this now. - [Jessica] No! - [Mom] Jessie, you are going to bed. - [Jessica] No, leave me alone! No, Daddy! No, no Daddy! Daddy, no! (loud ominous music) Daddy! (loud ominous music) - Mom? (loud ominous music) - Stop it! - No, Daddy! - Jessica, please! Ah! (loud slap) (suspenseful music) Amanda! Get up there and unplug that lamp! - Daddy! - Just please baby. - Help me! - Please, baby. - [Jessica] Daddy! (fast-paced suspenseful music) Daddy! No! (fast-paced suspenseful music) (slow suspenseful music) (quiet grating) (slow suspenseful music) (crickets chirp) - Nancy. - Thanks, Mom. I want that attic door locked. So she can't get up there again. - What was she doing up there? - She thinks she was talking to her father. Mom, it's that lamp. There's something about it that pulls her to it. - Nancy, it's just an old lamp. - I know what it is. It's what she thinks it is that worries me. - Well I'll call Dr. Briggs and have him come to see her in the morning. - I want her seen by a psychiatrist. - I think Dr. Briggs is qualified to make that decision. (crickets chirp) - I pray this will turn out to be a wasted trip. - Let's hope so. Thanks for your support, Father. - Go with God. (seagulls squawk) - Seems perfectly normal. - Could some kinda power surge have done it? - No. Not flick a switch. It's a mechanical action. The only thing I can figure is Danny must've made a mistake and taped the switch while it was in the on position. (seagulls squawk) (doorbell rings) - Would you get that Brian, please? - [Brian] Yeah, sure. - How can Danny make that kind of mistake? - Well it's an old switch. The on and off markings are worn. I'll check the fuse box. - [Brian] Hi. - Hi, telegram here for Mrs. Alice Leacock. - [Brian] I'll take it. - Sign here please. Line one. - There you go. Bye bye. - Brian? I can't find my black T-shirt. Is it in your closet? - I don't know. - Well I wanna wear it. - Hey don't go in my closet. I'll look for it. (slow ominous music) - [Doctor] She still has a slight fever. It wouldn't hurt to keep her home for the rest of the week. - What about those nightmares? - Well, I'm no psychiatrist. But considering the emotional trauma she's been through, add to that the fever brought on by some sort of flu bug, it's not uncommon to manifest itself in some sort of temporary delusion or hallucination. - Temporary. - I think so. Let's see what happens when the fever's gone. In the meantime, you try and keep yourself calm. If you're emotionally upset, it'll only add to her instability. - Thank you for coming, doctor. - Okay, anytime just give a call. Bye, Alice. - Goodbye doctor. Feeling better? - Yeah. - [Brian] Come on Mom, we're gonna be late. - Oh you're right, call your sister. - [Brian] Amanda. (faucet water runs) Amanda. - In a minute. (fast-paced suspenseful music) (Amanda screams) (fast-paced suspenseful music) Mom! (fast-paced suspenseful music) - Mrs. Leacock! (fast-paced suspenseful music) - What? - [Amanda] Mom! - Oh what is it? - I don't know! - Well this is the craziest... - [Grandma] Turn it off! - [No no no, leave it running. We'll see if it clears up. - It smells like a sewer! - It's the same upstairs, sink and toilet. - Has someone been fooling with the water pipes? - [Mom] How could this happen? - Beats me. Think you better get a plumber out here. - Well how could I afford all that? I'm not made of money. I've lived here for 45 years and never had what's been happening here the last three days. - Since the kids and I moved in. - I didn't say that. - That's what three days means. - I don't need to have my words interpreted for me. - [Peggy] It's clearing up. - I'll check upstairs. You better get in the car. We are gonna be late. - Well I checked the wiring in the fuse box, Mrs. Leacock. And I can't find anything wrong. - Of course not. That would be too easy, wouldn't it? (seagulls squawk) - [Grandma] I hope you don't mind me leaving you alone like this but I made this commitment weeks ago. - Oh you need some time away from here. Just be back by six, it's my bingo night. - Oh, I'll be back in plenty of time. And you better give Jessica some lunch. (car honks) (seagulls squawk) Will you take care of the plumber for me? - Oh sure, sure. (ominous instrumental music) (plumber grunts) - Oh, there it is. (cat meows) Whoa. (water runs) (suspenseful music) (grunts) (suspenseful music) (grunts) (loud rumbling) What the hell? (loud rumbling) My leg! (washing machine tumbles) (suspenseful music) (grunts) (loud groaning) Somebody help me! (suspenseful music) (loud grunts) Help! (plumber screams) (washing machine bangs) (plumber groans) (machine machine bangs) - Jake, you need anything? (bubbles gurgle) (engine purrs) (seagulls squawk) (deep ominous music) There we are, Jessica. (ominous music) Jessica? (Jessica giggles) (ominous music) (Jessica giggles) (ominous music) Jessica? You in there? (ominous music) (door squeaks) (ominous music) Jessica? You in here? (door slams) What? (suspenseful music) (Peggy groans) (ominous music) (flies buzz) (suspenseful music) (doorbell rings) - Hello. - Hello. I've come to see Mrs. Leacock. - Come in. (loud grumbling) - Is she in? - Somewhere. Come in. - I'm sorry, I'll have to come back later. - Come in and sit down. - No, I have to go. (ominous music) (flies buzz) (priest wretches) (groans) (flies buzz) - Mom, how can you defend her? You heard her this morning. She really believes it's us doing all that stuff to her precious house. - She doesn't know what she's saying. She's just floundering. - I think we should just leave. - And go where? We don't have that luxury. What we're doing is the best I can do. And if that means putting up with a cranky grandmother, then that's what you have to do. So why don't we all just stop bellyaching about it, okay? - [Amanda] Here's a note to Grandma. - Then don't read it. But it's weird Mom, listen. I'm a priest who was a friend of your sister Helen. I must speak to you about the lamp she sent. It is extremely urgent. I'm staying at the Roadside Inn. Don't try to telephone. Come and see me, please. Father Kibbler. Don't try to telephone? - Why would a priest be calling about a lamp? - Maybe Grandma can figure it out. - Hi, hon. You feeling better? - [Jessica] Yes. - Good. Where's Grandma? - She went out. - Oh. Let's see what we have here. (fast-paced suspenseful music) Jessica, why are you doing pictures like this? - I like it. - Where's Peggy? Does she know what you're doing in here? - She went home. - What do you mean she went home? She wouldn't go home and leave you alone. - She went home. (ominous music) - Brian, go upstairs and see if Peggy's up there. (ominous music) Peggy? - [Brian] Hey Grandma. - [Mom] Peggy! - What's all the fuss? - Jessica says that Peggy went home. - Why? - Why? That's what I'd like to know. How could she leave her alone? - She must be here. Peggy? - If she's done this to Jessica-- - Oh stop it, Nancy. Peggy would never do a thing like that and you know it. - What's all the shouting about? - Jessica says that Peggy went home. - Well her coat is in the hall closet. (ominous music) - Check all the rooms. Tell Brian. - I'll go check in back. (ominous music) - Why did you tell me Peggy went home? (ominous music) Jessica, look at me. - Mom! Come here! Hurry! Mom! (ominous music) - Who did this? - Go call the police. Find Peggy. (ominous music) - My God! - Mom, if you say Jessica's responsible for this, I will hit you! (ominous music) - Somebody's broken into our house. Send the police! (ominous music) - Jessica, what happened to your room? What happened to your room? (ominous music) Was someone here? Did someone come to visit? - A man came. - He came inside? (clock ticks) Did the man come in the house? - No. He went away. - Did he talk to Peggy? - Peggy went home. - She didn't go home. Her coat is still in the closet. (ominous music) Who told you she went home? - Daddy. - No! No, no, no! No. - Peggy. Peggy? (ominous music) (dark serene music) - Okay boys. Doesn't seem to be much doubt, these were done by the same person. And you say your daughter draw this? - What about the destruction? Look at this room. Jessica couldn't have done this! - I think so, Mrs. Evans. Don't you? Really? - No I don't. - Ray. Body's on the way to the morgue. - [Ray] So what's the verdict? - Looks like a heart attack. - Peggy was my age, doc. - And in good health. I did a physical on her not more than six months ago. Unfortunately, that's no guarantee when it comes to coronary thrombosis. I'll do an autopsy, but I'll bet money on a heart attack. - Did you notice her knuckles? - [Doctor] Blood and tissue on the door. I suspect she'd been pounding on it for some time. - Which indicates she had some strength. Why didn't she open the door? - Confusion maybe. - Or maybe the door was locked. - No. No, it wasn't. My grandson found it unlocked. - Your daughter wouldn't have been playing with the locks, would she? - No. - And she didn't hear Peggy pounding on the door? - She thought Peggy had gone home. - But what made her think that? Do you mind if I have a chat with her? - Not tonight. She's still weak from the flu. And this has been too much stress for her. - I understand. Can I come by in the morning? - That will be fine. (high-pitched ominous music) (deep ominous music) (Jessica hums) - What'd they say? - She had a heart attack. (ominous music) I have to go out for a little while. - Now? - It's just for a little while. I have to meet someone. As soon as the policeman is gone, I want you to take Jessica up to Amanda's room. Amanda, you stay with her. Don't let her out of your sight. - What's wrong with her, Mom? - I don't know. - [Amanda] What did Dr. Briggs say? - He doesn't know either. I'll take her into the city tomorrow. We'll see a specialist. Right now I need you to take care of her, okay? Brian, I want you to go upstairs and lock that attic door. Hide the key. I do not want Jessica in that room. Understand? - Yeah. (ominous music) - I'll be back as soon as I can. (Jessica hums) (ominous music) (ominous music) - Brian? - Mom told me to lock the door. But the light was still on in there. - What light? - I thought the light was still on. - Where is your mom? - [Brian] She had a meeting. - A meeting? Where? - [Brian] I don't know, she didn't say. - I'll take the key. And off to bed. (man laughs) - [Man] Right, right. (soft piano music) - [Woman] She had no idea what anybody was talking about. (wind blows) She had no idea! (patrons chatting) - Father Fibbler? - Ms. Leacock. - No, I'm her daughter. - Please, sit down. - Have you seen my aunt Helen? My mother is very concerned. She hasn't been able to make contact with her. - Your aunt passed away yesterday. Obviously you never received my tele... (sighs) my telegram. I don't know why that should surprise me. - How? What happened to her? - Tetanus. She cut her finger on the lamp that she sent your mother. (soft ominous music) What entered that lamp was three centuries of evil. That's the power it holds. That's the power that's invading your house right now. - This all seems so crazy. - That evil is searching for souls. And it will transmigrate into the most vulnerable person in its environment. We have to get everyone out of that house now. (slow piano music) - What if it's too late? What if it's already invaded the person? My daughter Jessica. She terrifies me. Father, her behavior. She believes that her father speaks to her through that lamp. - She sees him? - She thinks so. I know it's just an hallucination. - No. No, no that is the devil's disguise. He'll appear in the most seductive form necessary to get what he wants. (suspenseful music) (Pepper meows) (suspenseful music) - Pepper, did you get yourself stuck up there? (Pepper meows) Come on, kitty. Kitty kitty kitty, come on. Come on, Pepper. Come on, girl. Come here kitty kitty kitty. Come on Pepper. (Pepper meows) (suspenseful music) (car horn blows) - Ah, it knows I'm coming. - Knows? - I can feel it. - Is it afraid of you? - If it was afraid of me it never would have allowed you to meet with me. It wants me. - Father you're scaring the hell out of me. Why are you coming into this house? - I went into the other house and I defeated it. - Yeah but there was six of you. And even then, you barely survived it. Do you know something different this time? Do you have some new power? New ammunition? - Holy water. (suspenseful music) - When we get there, you stay in the car, keep the motor running. I'll go in and get everybody out fast. And then we'll just keep driving. - Jess, where are you going? You're supposed to stay in Amanda's room. - She's sleeping. - Jess, mom says you have to stay in there. - Daddy wants me. - Jess, Jess, Jess, come on. - No! (distant screaming) (ominous music) Daddy, no, no, no, no, no! - What happened? - I don't know! - Jessica, no. Jessica! (Amanda screams) Jessie! Jessie! (door creaks) (ominous music) - [Brian] Mom! - It's Brian. - Mom, Mom! Jessica's in the attic! We tried to stop her but we couldn't! - [Mom] Don't come back in the house. Get in that car and stay there! (ominous music) Amanda! (glass rattling) Open the door! Oh God. What's happening here? - [Mom] Mom? - She won't open the door! - Alright. - Mom, Mom! Mom! - My God, what happened? - It was an accident. The window fell on me. I'm okay. - I told you to stay out of the house! - [Grandma] Well what's happening here? Who is this man? - I'm a friend. We're gonna have to break this door down. Do you have an ax? - In the basement. - Go get it! - No! Amanda, get out of this house. I want her safe. - Alright, I'll get her out of the house. Just show me where the basement is. - [Mom] Jessie. Jessie please listen to mommy. Jessie. - Nancy! (ominous music) - Jessica! - [Amanda] It's on the right-hand wall! - Get out of the house now. - [Amanda] It won't open! (glass shatters) - Go! - [Brian] Run! Run Amanda, run! Run! (Amanda screams) (ominous music) - Stay here! - Jessica! - Don't move! (door slamming) Bless this house and all who are in it. (speaks in foreign language) (screaming) (speaks in foreign language) - Father! (suspenseful music) - Don't hurt my daddy! (priest grunts) - Jessica, no! Let go. Jessica, let go of the knife. Please, baby. Baby, please let go. Run! (suspenseful music) (thunder crashes) - [Jessica] Don't hurt my daddy! (priest speaks in foreign language) - [Frank] Nancy. Don't hurt me. I love you. - No! You're not Frank! - [Demon] Kill the priest. - No. Don't hurt Mommy. Put down the knife. - Leave us alone! Leave us alone you son of a bitch! (suspenseful music) - Nancy! (glass shatters) (priest screams) (panting) - Mommy? (soft serene music) I had a bad dream. - I know, baby. I know. - Are you alright, Father? - I am. (chuckles) You are one tough lady. - I just never knew. (seagulls squawk) - We'll never forget you, Father. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you, Father. - Goodbye Amanda. - [Brian] Come on, Grandma. - [Grandma] I can't find my purse. - [Jessica] Here it is, Grandma. - Oh good, thank you Jessica. - I am so sorry I can't be with you for Aunt Helen's funeral. - No well, you tell all these workmen that I'll be back in three days and I expect to have all this work completed to my satisfaction. - You are one tough lady. I love you. - Well, goodbye children. - [Children] Goodbye, Grandma. - [Amanda] Bye Grandma. - Oh. All this sweetness plays havoc on my blood sugar. - Come on, Jessica. Let's go find Pepper. - It's really over, isn't it Mom? - It's really over. - [Brian] Pepper, come here, kitty. - [Jessica] Pepper, where are you? - [Brian] Pepper, come here. - Pepper. - Come here, come on. - [Jessica] Here kitty kitty kitty. - [Brian] Pepper. - [Jessica] Pepper, come here. Where are you, Pepper? (Pepper meows) (suspenseful music) (thunder crashes) (ominous music) (Multicom Jingle)
