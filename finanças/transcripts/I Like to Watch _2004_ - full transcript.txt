Oh you do it so good. Fuck me yes, deep. You wanna split me? Turn over. You make me feel so good. Oh baby, I'm gonna come. No not yet, I want you to come on my face. I wanna taste it. Oh you do it so good. - Why can't it be every night? - It might spoil a great thing, Leticia. Besides, I wouldn't want you to get sick of me. - There's not much chance of that. (birds chirping) Good morning, Gretchen. - Good morning. - Good morning, Aunt Leticia. - Good morning, Laura. How are you this morning? - Oh, just fine. Did Phillip stay long last night? - No, he left quite early, and I went to bed and read. - Oh, too bad. - No, not at all. We're just friends. Look, Linda Vance is coming in for a refitting today, and I think we ought to finish the summer set, or at least get started on it. - Oh, everything is going just fine. We're right on schedule. Things are going well, there's just a lot of work to do. (sighs) - God! I don't think we're gonna get it done, I really don't. We've got two weeks to go, and I can do stage work but this television is just killing me. I just don't think we're gonna make it. - Everything will be all right, I'm sure. - I don't know what I'd do without you. You're a gem, you really are. Are you seeing Michael tonight? - Well, I don't know. Sometimes I think he's afraid of me. - Don't be silly. Why don't you just go out and have a good time? - Well, I'll try. I better be getting started. - I think so. - I'll see you in the studio. (sensual music) - Your work's impeccable, Leticia. You're the best. - I know, darling. Kim, why don't you go down to the vault and get Ms. Vance's lingerie. - Yes, Ms. Bordeaux. - Hello, Ms. Vance. - Hello. - Linda, I'd like you to meet my niece, Laura. She's my good right arm. I don't know what I'd do without her. - Ms. Bordeaux, as I was coming back to the studio, I noticed the furnace repair truck pulled up. - Oh God, I'd forgotten all about that. Kim, why don't you let him in and take care of him. Give him what he needs. - Yes, Ms. Bordeaux. - Linda, why don't you go inside and try it on? And Laura will do your final alterations. I've got so much to do with the show coming up. I've got phone calls to make. Ciao, darling. - Bye bye. - You know, I was out here just a week ago. - I know. - It's all right. Plumbing in these houses and electrical, I mean, they're hung together with scotch tape and spit. I don't see anything wrong. I don't know what the problem is. Didn't you guys say you have some new steam pipe running here a while back? - Yeah, there's a couple pipes up in one of the closed off bedrooms upstairs. I'd be glad to take you up there. - It'd probably help if I could see it. - Sure, come on. (soft music) - Just one more mark here. - Do you think these panties work well with this? - No, the lace is a little too different. - Maybe I should take them off then. If you ever want this, just call me. I'll show you something you'll never forget. - Laura! Has Linda left? - No, she's in dressing right now. - How about lunch? - No, thanks. I've gotta Michael at the park, and if I don't leave right now, I'll be late. - The radio said rain today. - I know, I think he's crazy. - Gretchen, it'll be two for lunch. - Yes, ma'am! - Leticia, I think it's just beautiful. - Thank you. How about lunch? - Excuse me, Ms. Vance. I've got to go. - Now, about lunch. - Let me buy, I insist. - Well, all right, I have to get out of here. Gretchen! - [Gretchen] Yes, ma'am! - I'll be leaving and I'll be back about two-ish. And, Kimberley is with the furnace man wherever. Find her, tell her to get back up here, get to work, we've got a show in two weeks. - Yes ma'am! - Shall we? - This bypass valve is probably frozen. You wanna hand me that can of oil? - Here's your oil. - Kim! Kim! Kim! (dramatic music) - How am I supposed to fix your furnace? - You're fixing it right now. I never thought anything like this would happen on a job. - Kim! Kim! There's a blow to call. (moaning) Oh that feels so good. (Speaks German) Oh you really want me to slam it in there don't you? Yes please! (speaks German) Put it deep. Aw, deeper! I'm gonna fuck you so hard. Give it all to me! Oh God, it's so good! I want you to fuck me in the ass. (Speaks German) (Speaks German) What was that? A big rat. - God, I must be crazy being out in weather like this for lunch. - Guess who. - Give me a hint. - Well, I'm tall. I'm bright, not dark. Very, very handsome, and I love you. - I don't know anybody like that. - Well, in that case, it's Jack the Ripper. (laughing) - Who do you think you are, Gene Kelly? What are we doing out here in the rain? I love you, you clown. - Yeah, I'm a fun date. Dance around a little bit, maybe? - This is crazy. - Look, for you. Nothing up the sleeve, nothing up the sleeve. Apple juice, ma'am. Special, imported... - You know my favorite. - And, avocado and cheese sandwich. - Oh, great. I am starving. We've been working so hard with this show coming up. - Was it exactly? - It's in two weeks. Don't you ever listen to me? - Yeah, sure, I listen to you. - Yeah, but you don't hear me. Michael, I have to talk to you. I'm really serious. - Okay, this is serious, what is it? - Why haven't you ever made love to me? I mean, it's been three months, and all these romantic rendezvous and everything, but... But no sex. You know, Michael. Fucking, why? - Hey, I was just trying to be a gentleman. You know, romance and some fun. I want a little bit more than just hopping into bed. - This is really funny. That's supposed to be my line. - Hey, you know. Come on, my ex-wife... - I am not your ex-wife. I am Laura. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I've got to go. - Hey, I'll pick you up eight, okay? - No, not tonight. (gentle music) - Laura. - Oh, you startled me. - I'm sorry. I'm going out tonight. I really need to relax. I thought you were going out with Michael. - [Laura] Oh, well, I was. - You wanna talk about it? - No. - [Leticia] Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, really, I'm okay. Why don't you go out and have a drink for me? - Well, all right, but I'll be in Nick's at the bar, if you wanna meet me later. - Okay. - [Leticia] Goodnight. (gentle music) - Gretchen, I wanna talk to you. - Yes, Kim. - What were you doing today? - Nothing. - Oh yes, you were. You were watching me. Come here. Sit down. I'm not angry with you. Did you like what you saw? - Yes! - It can be better with a woman. (phone ringing) - Laura, Linda! - Oh, hello, Linda. - You sound out of breath. - [Laura] Oh, I ran to the phone. - Oh. Well, I was supposed to go out this evening but my date canceled. So, I thought maybe you'd like to come over for a drink. - Oh, that sounds great. Give me your address. - [Linda] It's 134 Elm Street. - Okay, got it. Okay, I'll be there in about half an hour. Bye! - She'll be here in about a half hour, so... - You're so good to me. - I'm gonna give you a great show tonight, lover. - Good, because I like to watch. (sensual music) (moaning) (Speaks German) - Laura. - No, Michael, not now. I'm going out. - We can go out. - Wrong. - Dammit, I'm gonna wait here all night for you. (crickets chirping) - Let me take your coat. - Oh, thank you. - Please, sit down. Over there by the fire, take the chill off. - The fire does feel nice. (sensual music) - Amaretto? - Please. - To a very long, deep friendship. - To a long, deep friendship. - How do you feel about what happened today? - Well, I don't know. - I know. - You do? - Yes, I do. You liked it. That's why you've come to me tonight, to explore. I wanna bathe your body with my tongue. - I don't know what's happening to me. Does that feel nice Laura? You like the feel of my tongue on your body? Oh I do. Yes just like that. Lick you down here? Inside your thighs? Please do it there, yes. Oh you make me tingle. Oh that's perfect. Oh you make me feel wonderful. That's right ladies. Yes. Did you like that? Oh I loved it. Will you do that to me? Well...I... Try. That's right. That's delicious Laura. Oh yes, lick around my thighs. That's right girls. Oh yes Laura. Your bodies are so beautiful. - Do you trust me? - Yes! - We were being watched. We've been watched all along. - By Who? - By Montag, my lover. He's very nice, and he'd like to come in here. Is it okay? - Well... - You'll really enjoy him. - You fucking sluts. - Isn't she pretty, Montag? - Your body is so beautiful. - I told you she'd have a pretty, pretty pussy and big breasts. That's it. Mmm, kiss her Montag. She's a beautiful girl. Make love to me Montag. See Montag, I like to watch too. - Thanks, keep the change. Hi. Are you waiting to go in? - Yes, I am waiting to go in. - I'm Cinnamon. - Honey. - Hello! - I'm Michael. - Good evening, Michael. - Hello, Gretchen. Please come in. - [Cinnamon] Thank you. - [Honey] Thank you. - Gretchen, this is Cinnamon and this is Honey. - Hi. - Good evening. - I would guess that they are a couple of Leticia's models. - I'm sorry, Michael, but Laura isn't here right now. - Yeah, I know. Do you mind if I wait? - Of course. If you two ladies please follow me, I'll show you to your room. - [Cinnamon] Goodnight, Michael. - Yeah, goodnight, Michael. That guy Michael was kinda cute. - I'd say more than just kind of. - Okay, he was cute. Hey, Cinnamon. - Yeah. - Hey, girl, I'm about to unveil a master plan of eroticism and you just snubbed me off. - I'm sorry. Let me hear your master plan. - Okay, first off, this is what we do. (fire crackling) (ominous howling) (gasps) (ominous music) - Hello! Hello, is anyone there. Look, Gretchen. Is that you? Oh shit! (grunting) - We didn't mean to scare you. - Yes, it was just a joke, Michael. - A joke. - I wouldn't say scared, no. A little startled. (panting) - Okay. - Just, this does not seem to be my day. - It's your day. Dream of a lifetime. (upbeat music) - And one, four, three, pick up that shot. Stand by three. Take three. Ready, cross fade into four. That's better four, looking good. Cross fade to four. Real nice, real nice. A little more. Okay, tighten up there, four. Slow zoom in. Stand by at one... - Girl, would you please get dressed? - Listen, I can't wear this goddam thing. - Why? - Because, I look horrible in it. - Look girl, you either put it on, or I will put it on for you. - Bitch, I don't need the fucking money. - Come on, come on! (dramatic music) Come on. Oh my God, what tits. What an ass. - Come on, here, here, let me see. - Just a second, just a second. I'd walk through five miles over a mine field in snow shoes, just to hear her fart over a fuel drum. - Let me see, huh. Come on, Fred. Christ. - [Fred] Well, when I was in-- - When you were in Nam? - When I was in Nam, I just walked in. - Well, why don't you just walk in there now, super stud? (mumbles) Well, 50 bucks says you don't dare. - You're on. - How are things going? - Oh, not too bad. - I've tried to keep things down to a low roar. - [Laura] I know you have, Norma. (screaming) -Asshole, you pervert. Get outta here. (screaming) - What balls, I don't believe it! - I knew I should've stayed home. (upbeat music) - Take one. Ready on preview for commercial. Roll it. Five, four, three, two, one. Cross fade to commercial. Good. Yeah. It's for you. - Laura. I wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear any crap. - Okay. Okay, Michael. Here? - Yeah, here, right after the show, and in the studio. - [Phillip] Hello, Tish, it's Phil. - Hello, Phil. - [Phillip] Look, I know you're really busy now, but I've been thinking about our talk a few weeks ago. - Oh? - [Phillip] You know, about getting together on a more permanent basis. (sighs) - Oh! - [Phillip] How about meeting me for a drink tonight? - Well, look, I'll be here about another hour. How about Nick's? - [Phillip] Yeah, okay. - I'll see you later, bye. (background chattering) - Michael. Michael. Do you wanna talk here? - No! Get up there. And sit down. For the last few months, you've picked on me and made me feel like a fool. Well, those days are over. You got a lot of nerve staying out all night like that. Well, I'm not gonna take it anymore, Ms. Bordeaux. - Is this my Michael? - Yes, it is. - Come sit down over here. Michael, I have something that I wanna tell you about that night that I stayed out. - What? - Oh, never mind. Michael, make love to me. (sensual music) - [Michael] Here? Now? I wanna do it to you now. I needed you to make love to me. - Oh, that was wonderful, Michael. - Yeah. You know, I'm a pretty good lay. - Such a conceit. - Round two?
