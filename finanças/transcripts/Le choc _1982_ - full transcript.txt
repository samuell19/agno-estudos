Christian? It's me. Someday, you won't be so lucky... Maybe that wouldn't be too bad. What the fuck are you doing, sitting in the dark? Is it bad? Pretty bad, yes. My mother died. It's weird... I never thought it would be such a shock. Michel, put it down. I'm here for you. - Yes? - It's Mathilde. Come back later. I have company. Are you kidding me? I won't stand out here all night! - Let's have dinner. - Forget it. I'm feeling better. I just needed to talk to somebody. I'm okay now. Besides, I don't want to be in your way. Wait. I, too, have something to tell you. - I quit. - Quit what? I'm resigning. I'm getting out. - Does Cox know? - Not yet. He's not going to be happy. You're making a mistake. - We shall see. - Be careful, Christian. You can't just walk out on the Organization. And Cox is a real bastard. I'm sure you've got it all planned out. Don't you worry about me. Are you going to sit here all night? What a warm welcome! I've brought you some chicken and some cake, sweetie! - What? - I'm not your "sweetie"! How was your trip? Dreadful! You should have taken me with you. I told you. - What's this package? - It's for you. For me? Unbelievable! What the hell is that? Christian? - May I take a shower with you? - No. Hand me the bathrobe. Can I get a kiss? You haven't even kissed me. - It's your first present ever. - It's the last one too. What does that mean? It means it's over between us. I did tell you I'd leave someday. Well, I'm leaving now. Is it for another girl? Don't be silly. - Take me with you. - I can't. - What about the cat? - He's coming with me. Please make love to me. Please. One last time. Don't cry, Mathilde. Let me keep Sudan. You're such an asshole. I'm warning you, I'll fuck everything that moves! Good for you. I hate you, you jerk! And I hate your stupid gift! There, there, Sudan. It's okay. It's just the way broads are. I apologize for the long trip, Christian. The doctor wants me to stay inside for now. My leg, you know... Will you have breakfast with me, Mr. Morelli? No, thanks. Please, sit down. Nice job, Christian. We're very pleased. Sylvio, the money. We've added a bonus for you, Mr. Morelli. You were very efficient. Really. The Organization still needs you, Mr. Morelli. We have a big and rather unexpected mission for you. What do you say? I'm not interested. - 250,000 francs. - Don't insist. We can make it 300,000. But that's it. I quit, Mr. Cox. I'm retiring. You should have told me. I'm telling you now. One doesn't just walk out on the Organization, Mr. Morelli. But that's what I'm going to do. Look at him: big, strong... and stupid. He can't replace you. Ask Michel to find you somebody else. No... it's too late. We can't do without you, because you're the best. You know it, and we know it. End of discussion. Sylvio? See, you are the best. What's the capital of Bolivia? La Paz. That one's not going to win. What American filmmaker, originally from Germany, - made "The Blue Angel"? - Crap. Josef von Lindberg. - Josef von Sternberg. - Yeah, von Sternberg. Radio Taxi. How may I help you? I need a cab at 15 Boulevard Delestraint, please. Please hold. What's bigger: a duck egg of a chicken egg? A duck egg. Have you ever seen a duck lay an egg? You've lost your bonus, but you still win our super board game... My little pasha. If anybody walks in, just bark. - Looking for me, boy? - No. - What's your name, kiddo? - What's it to you? Tell our dear Mr. Cox that no means no. On your feet. - Now repeat. - No means no. - One more time. - No means no. Good boy! Mrs. Faulques, please. And it's regarding...? It's personal. We have an appointment. There's a long wait. I'll go to the vault then. Mr. Fournier, I have someone here for you. That's a nasty habit. Try smiling instead. - Hi. - Hello, Mr. Morelli. Thanks. - Mrs. Faulques is here, sir. - About time! Martin, I'm sorry but.. - How much? - 300. - Which adds up to 600. - 615. - And the rest? - You told me to invest it, right? I did, but now I want it all. - Want a bite? - No. Listen, I don't think it's a good idea to sell now. I need to show you something. - Where? - At my place. No. Really, no! There's no cabs. Let's take the bus. It's cheaper and faster. With what I have in my safe, I can afford a cab. Forget it and hurry! Wait up! Money's worthless now, and so is gold. So I decided to invest in something more reliable. So I bought you a plant. - What kind of plant? - A turkey plant. Turkey? You do as you wish, but I think you're making a mistake. You've asked me to manage your money, and that's what I'm doing. - So if you don't follow my lead... - You're talking about turkeys! Hi, babies. Oh, you naughty boys! You've made puddles all over the floor! Watch your step. That thing is still here?! Get rid of it! - The plant? - No, that beast! Beber? No way! Hey, kitty. I'll never leave you. It's a wonderful opportunity and a promising company. Even the Japanese are interested. Hi, Nini. - Who cares about the Japanese? - What? - Get rid of it! - That's all you think about. We can't sell now, or you might lose everything. Where did I put the-- here, grab her for a minute. Here. Thanks. Here it is. You just have to sign it. Here you are. Just sign this. Why not go visit it? It's in Brittany. This is the Faulques office. You have reached an automated response. Please call back in an hour. Freaking people! Come on, sign! Okay, all right. She's losing her hair! How can you be so cruel? - Come on, sign! - Where? Here. Your initials too. You're a nutcase. Sudan? Sudan? Mathilde, is the cat with you? Fuck you! I'm warning you, I'll set your furniture and your apartment on fire! The door was open, so I came in. This place is so messy. Let go of that thing. And don't try anything stupid. What do you want? A quiet talk with you. - Christian, open the door! - Go the fuck away! I'm warning you, I'm not moving. Open! She's insisting, so open the door. I'll lie down in front of your door! I was just kidding. Do come in, miss. Go over there. Go by the window. Come over here, miss. On your knees. Good girl. Now open your mouth. Wider. Thank you. Now close it. Just like on the dentist's chair. Mr. Morelli, make a move and I'll shoot. There. I hope there'll be no more interruptions now, Christian. May I call you Christian? My name's Boro. My real name's Borevitch. I'm from... I have a feeling I'm already boring you. Excuse me? Of course not. - You're from Russia. - My mom's French. Her parents left after the October Revolution, so... Where was I? Yes. I'm here to give you some good news. The Organization has found a replacement for you. - And that person is... - It's you, okay. Moving on. Is he like this with you, too? Mr. Cox has requested that you give back the envelope... ...with the money inside, of course. - My severance pay? - Not at all. You get severance pay when you get fired. But you've decided to leave. - It's a penalty. - A penalty? The bastard's heavy! - Where are you going now? - I'll call you in a week. - You got a car? - I've got everything I need. Christian! - You'll be back, right? - No. No... Take care of him. I won't say a word. - I know. - Do you believe me? Good boy. Good boy. That's good. Where's your dad? Where is he? Mr. Chevalier! Go, go, go... What are you doing? Are you insane? Help me get them back in! Go, go! Go! Go! You let them out, now help me get them back inside! Come on, get to it! - Fuck! - You're a natural! You're a natural. I'm not kidding! What do you want me to do, Mrs. Chevalier? Don't do anything. I couldn't care less about the Council! I warned you. Now it's out of my hands. - My regards to your husband. - Excuse me! Listen, I don't need anything and I get my supplies at the co-op. Martin Terrier, rings a bell? Let go of me! What do you want with him? Only good things. I'm Terrier! But you may call me Martin. Welcome, Mr. Terrier. And congratulations! You've made a great investment here. Isn't this place nice? What do you want to start the tour with? The showers. How long will you be staying? Three or four days, maybe more. I was touched by your warm welcome. You can spend the rest of your life here if you want. This is your place, after all. So what's the object of your visit? Well - fuck! As the owner, I'm interested in my business. Did your marketing department suggest the turkey business? I had a choice between chickens and turkeys, so I picked turkeys. - Where's your husband? - In Quimperlé. He's attending the farmers' protest. Any concerns about turkey sales? Are you kidding? Everybody loves turkey, except for me. What does this road lead to? To town. 21 miles away. Cheerful little place: swampland, cornfields, more swampland, more cornfields... - Shall I have it cleaned? - Hold on. My cigarettes. Yes? Sorry, I just wanted to grab something from the closet. Please help yourself. What's that racket? They always come back here after a demonstration with Felix. That's my husband. It's a good thing he's helping them. When we moved here seven years ago, this place was a wreck. And we knew nobody. They all came by to pitch in, and look at it now. So to show his gratitude, he's agreed to head their committee. Of course, now he's running for deputy. I doubt he'll make it. My husband and I are really happy together. We're devoted to each other. Félix doesn't want any kids, but I don't mind. He's got a lot of ideas for this business. He's very competent. Isn't this great? Do you like... Bacra Linxton? Braca who? He doesn't know Braca Linxton! He's much better than Anthony Braxton and Marion Brown, right? Do you support the Green movement? What are you doing? - It's too loud. - Too loud? Listen to this. Say... we've got some work to do. All the files are here. I'll show you the accounting, the blueprints-- Are you fucking nuts?! Will you stop breaking our balls? Who does she think she is? There! I'm warning you, and I won't say it twice! Goddamn it! I forgot what I was about to say. Too bad. Want some coffee? Two coffees. Goddamn it! You don't have to stay! Go to your room! Am I right or what? That's enough. - Why? - It's embarrassing. Okay, you're the boss here. Let's get to the point. Let me show you... the production charts. Then we'll take a look at the accounting. If you want to. The schedule... Do you want the exact figures? - Of what? - The figures. You're the boss. What line of business were you in before? Dry-cleaning. In Paris? Paris, New York, Amsterdam. Fuck! Pain in the ass! It's fucked. Where- who--. I'll be right back. Impressive. Where's he going? - To town. 21 miles away. - Right. Swampland, cornfields, swampland, cornfields. What does he do there? Whiskey, beer, whiskey, beer. Have a good night. You too. Whose glasses are these? They're mine. So... let's take a look at these. 127,816 turkeys of both sexes, divided by 52 weeks. Put down three turkeys and carry one. Do you have the schedule? Right-- I hope it's got the exact figures. What's going on? Félix, what's going on? Nothing. Just having fun! Get the fuck out! Don't fucking touch this! FéliX! Have you lost your mind? - Get the fuck out! - Are you nuts? Get the fuck out now! As you wish. I won't spend my life with a lunatic! He's going nuts. Damn! Claire! I'm all right. Good morning. Going to the beach? He had fantastic ideas. He was sweet. He really was. But he started drinking when we moved back from Africa. He talked to others instead of talking to me. He lost sight of me. But I was there for him. Do you know where he wants to go now? To Nepal. What for? He wants to be a guide. Has he been there before? Never. - What about you? - Me? I just follow the guide. - I'm hungry. - Waiter, please! - And a pack of cigarettes, please. - Yes, sir. Now you can tell me about your life. I could. What does that mean? That means a Jesuit school... pharmaceutical studies... married, with five children. All that's a lie. You're right. Tell me the truth. No. Claire? Where are you? Here. Don't move! What's this about? What do you want from me? On your knees. Arms up. Everybody on their knees, with their hands up. What is this? What do you want? Leave him. He's got nothing to do with this. Compared to what you'll get if you interfere, that's nothing. We are the Schroeder group. Schroeder, 1979. Rings a bell? Take them upstairs. Then we'll talk. - It's too late. - It's never too late! We know nothing and we don't want to know. Leave us out of it. Just lock us up upstairs. Kill him! Are you insane? I - He won't say anything. But he's sleeping with my wife! Lock me upstairs, but keep her with you, so he'll talk! Otherwise, he won't say a word! He's sleeping with her. I won't tell anyone. Please. I can prove it to you. He put his gun in my pocket earlier. Take a look. You bastard! Go fuck yourself! I can't breathe... Is this his? Yes. He gave it to me earlier. It's his revolver. It's not a revolver. It's a gun. SQ? So I was paid to off some guy in Dusseldorf in August 79. He calls him a "guy". His name was Karl Schroeder. - What do you want to know? - We want to know who paid you. I don't know his name. We communicated through the ads in a paper. That's all I know. No, you must know a lot more. Shall we take care of your lady friend? I received orders to kill him. - That's what I get paid for. - So where's the money? My business manager takes care of it. Very well. You're going to call him. And? Call him. Then we'll see. Let her go first. Would you rather place your call with or without balls in your pants? Let's go. Quick! We have to leave. What for? So you can kill guys in Dusseldorf, Paris or New York? - Come on! - No. - Come with me! - No! No. What's in the bag? My passport, personal documents, my handkerchief-- everything- You have to explain, Martin. Who do you work for? I don't know. For big companies, governments... for individuals-- for you, if you have the money. There are two solutions, Claire: we can disappear together... right away-- that's the first option-- or I can drop you off somewhere, in Paris or right here on the side of the road. Make your choice... but make it fast. Step on it. Book a room for Mr. and Mrs. Walter. Wait for me, I'll be quick. Will you be all right? Yes. Jeanne? Jeanne. Michel! Here we go! Are you fucking nuts?! What's wrong with you? Don't touch it. Stupid ass. What are you doing here? I got the People's Brigade on my tail, the Schroeder Commando. My money's gone and I need time to shape up. Are you with me or should I repeat? Look at the fucking mess here. It was my mom's. I don't know what to do with it. - Michel. - I don't know anything. What do you want me to do? Don't come near me. Everybody's after me. Don't you get it? They're all over... outside, behind the walls, behind the fucking furniture, in my bathroom, even in my bed. I've had it, Christian. I'm scared. Get that? I'm scared shitless! Do you know what that means? You don't know what that means. You're never scared. You're never cold. You're never hot. You don't love anyone. You've never loved anyone. No one. Not your mother, not your father. You never knew them, anyway. Where's Cox? I don't know. I swear I don't. He's probably got your money. They're all-powerful. I told you so. Don't leave me, Christian. We'll go there together... and we'll make a clean score. Like we used to. Remember? I remember. "Christian's Dry-Cleaning, back in business. Call Mr. Walter at the Bristol Hotel." - Is that correct? - That's it. - Can you run the ad tomorrow? - Certainly. Please sign here. What took you so long, Martin? Only one other person used to call me that. A woman? She was my wife... a long time ago. Her name was Jeanne. We remained very close... almost like brothers. They killed her. Claire... everything in my safe has been stolen. I'm broke. So you have to go now. I have to go because you're broke? Because of this, too. And so what? Don't you get it? If you speak up now, you were nothing but a hostage. But if you stay, you're my accomplice. What's your choice? What's your choice? I'd rather keep doing what I've been doing the past 10 years. That's what I do. Do you know what that means? Do you know what that means? - Do you like me now? - Yes, I do! Here. Tell them your kidnapper was a short guy with a mustache. A German guy. Don't move, Mr. Walter. This thing I'm holding isn't a fork. How did you get here so fast? We were tipped off. Someone spotted the ad. Even the best slip sometimes. Don't move. What a joke: His Highness was going to retire! What was it going to be? Polynesia? The Bahamas? - What are you doing? - If you've come to chit-chat, - we'll have tea and cookies. - Get dressed. We're leaving. - And don't try anything stupid. - Look at this. Show me those pretty eyes. I see. That's some way to retire. I'm cold. Mr. Walter, please. What's this fucking mess about? Did you do this? You off terrorists in a turkey plant... you take a woman hostage and on top of it, you fuck her! She's fuckable, mind you. What about the others? - The Schroeder Commando? - I want my money. Listen to yourself... you're obsessed! I don't understand how a discreet and detail-oriented man like you got trapped by that commando. They're looking for you too. I figured that much. We'll take care of it. You've recently placed an ad. Are you back on the saddle? I want my money. You're slipping, Christian. You lost your money? A million francs... Are you interested? Well... almost a million. Fucking leg. It's all yours. It's your money. You can get it back if you do as we say. On top of the usual bonus, of course. Let the woman go. Are you kidding? They're all looking for her. Looks like it's serious. It's time, at your age. Christian, listen... I'll provide you and the girl with passports. Plus the money. After that, you can both go to hell and even have kids, if you please. What's the job? In two days, in Paris. You'll get instructions. Good night. Frankly, do you think you have a choice? Mr. Walter? Here's your customers, Blue Angel! It's about time! The chicken's going to be overcooked! Be nice and take care of the lady. Come on, kitten. I won't hurt you. Sit. This is Place de I'Etoile. This is the Champs Elysées. It's a two-way street, as you know. You and I will be here, in a van... parked on the left, near rue de Presbourg. Got it? I'll be your driver. In the back of the van, there's a slide and two doors. Keep going. Right. Our target will lay a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe at 4pm. On their way back down, you shoot them. - Are you kidding? - Not at all. There'll be cops everywhere. How do you expect to pull it off? The Van's got a double floor. You'll slip under it and be quiet. And you'll drive off, just like that? No, I won't. I'll get out of the van and identify myself. Inspector Maubert. I'm in charge of the target's security. What is it? What do you care who the target is? Some towel-head, a big shot in oil. What's the weapon? That was my question. What's your preference? A gun with muzzle velocity and a silencer. - An Ingram? - No. No. I need more velocity. I don't know if I can get that for you. Then find me something simple and reliable. A water gun, for instance. I'll do my best, Mr. Terrier. What are you going to do? I'll get my money back and come back for you. Why didn't they take your weapon? They kept the bullets. What if you don't come back? I'll be back. - What are they all doing? - They're hunting. - They're not eating? - Later. Something smells good. I'll go get my lady. Don't try that again. - Why not? - I said never again! - What's going on? - Hurry! I love you, Martin. It smells good, doesn't it? - So... let's eat! - God damn it! Out, quick! You could have gotten us fired, Mr. Walter! Bullets. How many times have you done this? I bet you get a ton of money for this. When you think of it, anyone could do your job. For me, killing in cold blood... I don't know how I would react. You're different. You always know what to do. And that's why they give you tons of money. I'll go get some air. Perfect! Everything's going great. It should be easy. - Speak up! - Cox... He said I was supposed to kill you after you got the job done. I was just following orders. - Where is Cox? - I don't know. I swear I don't! You're not going to kill me, right? No. What about my lady friend? She's safe, 'cause I was supposed to get rid of her! I'll help you if you want. - Can you deliver a message to Cox? - Sure. Anything you want. Tell him this. It's up there. He's renting the last floor for his business. He's going to pay for this... and more. We'll just squash him like a roach! You're losing your hair. Well done, guys! Good job! Michel. How are you, buddy? What a game! Unbelievable! They've just scored! It's a goal! - So what's the score? - 1-0. You're kidding? That was the score an hour ago! It's just not the same game. - In the pool? - Yes. Precisely. How many of them in there? - It's just Cox and some guy. - Where? Cox is at his desk and the other guy's by the door. Michel, don't! My money- People can be so rude. 4 left, 2 right, 2 right, 4 left. Something to drink? May I? How long have you guys been friends? Why do you ask? For no reason. Michel... What? Thank you. You're welcome. Christian... put your hands up here. Come on. Don't look at me like that. We're not friends. We're not friends, Christian. And you're not the toughest. I am. - Michel... - Shut up. I sent you the Schroeder Commando. And I took care of Faulques. And now, you're going to disappear. I took your money... I took it all. I feel lonely. So lonely. Don't leave me, Christian. Don't leave me. That was quick! - What do you want? - Where's my wife? - She's with Blue Angel. - Where at? - Where at? - I don't know. Claire. Martin! So, will it be Polynesia or the Bahamas? Take me far, as soon as we can. Let's go, then.
