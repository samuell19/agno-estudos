MAHALINGAIAH: In terms of our fertility, when a compound has an endocrine-like activity, or is an endocrine disruptor... any substance that is synthetic, that can act like an endocrine hormone. And so the endocrine system has multiple different hormones. The thyroid hormone that comes from the thyroid, oestrogen and testosterone are well-known sex steroid hormones. ♪ DR.

That's affecting your hormone signalling system. ♪ DR. PLANTE: We're trying to figure out if some endocrine disruptors can promote breast cancer, or induce breast cancer, or have an effect on the mammary gland development.

CRAMER: In medical school I was very much interested in obstetrics and gynaecology as a speciality. But I always had the intent to go on to get a degree in epidemiology. And when it came time to choose a thesis, that is, epidemiologic study of some disease or another, I chose ovarian cancer. DR. NESS: Dan is the guy who I consider to be kind of the grandfather, one of the grandfathers of epidemiology, which is my field. And epidemiology, you know, I call us detective people. He was one of the people who published way back in the early 1980s one of the first papers to link talc and ovarian cancer.

ALDERSON: Without question, we would want to know that, sir. SEN. KERRY: Well, it's in public domain. It seems to me the FDA is putting its faith in an industry to self police through a panel called the Cosmetic Ingredient Review. Surprise, surprise, the industry funded the panel of scientists, and they've reviewed only 11% of the more than 10,000 ingredients contained in cosmetics. DR. LANPHEAR: I'd like to be able to put myself out of a job. That means that we're protecting kids. And we're not having to use them to determine whether this chemical or that chemical is toxic. Which is not of course what industry wants us to do. They'd just rather continue to use a product without any regulation whatsoever. DR. MICHAELS: What we're seeing now is there's a whole industry, the product defence industry, which is made up of for-profit corporations that are run by scientists, who are consultants, and some of these supposed think-tanks. I mean, it's ludicrous. The Indoor Tanning Association is out there saying... Questioning the science around ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer. DR. MICHAELS: Something I've seen is that this manufacturer of uncertainty and trying to show there are two sides to every issue around science degrades all scientists. It makes it looks like scientists are just part of a debating society, and they're like lawyers. But science isn't like that. Science is the search for the truth. But hiring people to say something specific not because it's the truth, but because it defends a product, or it defends a corporation, really does make it hard for all scientists. DR.

JULIE: The world operates with what's called a post-market regulatory system. That means that the product is put onto the market first. It's not like you have to test the product first, make sure it's safe, and then it goes on the market.

And we're gonna have a look under the microscope at whether they're growing, and whether they're growing more with parabens than without parabens. I've tested all of them individually, and in combination, and they can make human breast cancer cells grow, and may be able to mimic oestrogen action in breast cells. DR. DARBRE: In 2004, we upset the world by showing that parabens could even get into the human breast. We then did a bigger study in 2012, in which we found paraben in 158 out of 160 samples. And furthermore, we didn't find one paraben, we found five parabens in 60% of those samples. Parabens are added to many products to preserve them. Body care products and skin care products that you can buy on the supermarket shelf. I'm actually quite upset by how much I've measured in human breast tissue. ♪ DR. ZOTA: One common adage is that the dose makes the poison. That is not so straightforward with endocrine disruptors, because sometimes you can have different effects at lower levels. Sometimes more severe effects than you can at higher levels. In utero exposures are most often linked with some of the most severe effects that we've seen to date, as well as effects early in childhood. [children laughing] DR. JAMES-TODD: Children's bodies work differently. They're smaller; they metabolize things differently than we do. And their bodies are developing still. So when they're exposed to these endocrine disrupting chemicals in our personal care products, that has implications for that child's future health. What we know is that the children who start their periods younger are at an increased of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes. And so we really believe that childhood could be a sensitive window of time by which these exposures might be particularly deleterious. MALE NARRATOR: Little girls like to look pretty.

And why isn't this talked about, then? If this is one of the most deadly cancers for women, why isn't this brought out in the public? WOMAN: Hi, ladies. WOMEN: Hi. WOMAN: Yeah, well, I can't hear anything. [laughter] WOMAN: Hi, thank you. DEANE: I went on the National Ovarian Cancer Alliance site, and I just put on a blog: "Has anyone else developed ovarian cancer "from talcum powder?" And then Alan Smith, the lawyer that I ended up getting, contacted me. And he said, "I think you'd be the good case, "because they can't find anything against you." We started the lawsuit, and then Johnson & Johnson of course tried to fight it. They tried to get it thrown out for this reason, that reason, everything. But the judge was a woman, thankfully, and she stood behind us and said, "No, it's gotta go to court." DR. CRAMER: I first published my study in 1982, and I did not contact Johnson & Johnson; they contacted me. Dr. Bruce Semple, who was the medical director of Johnson & Johnson at the time wanted to meet with me; came to Boston. I think he spent his time trying to convince me that talc was a harmless habit, and I said, "Well, maybe you just should consider "you may need to put a warning label on it, "or you'll want to put a warning label on it." I was contacted by a little magazine called Cancer Prevention for Primary Care Doctors. I wrote the little article about why you should warn your patients about talc. ♪ DR. CRAMER: Well, that caught Dr. Semple's attention again, and he wrote a letter. They encouraged me to limit the amount of public discussion of the topic. ♪ DR. CRAMER: I didn't have any further contact with them. I think they kept track of what I was studying, and my papers on the topic. ALAN: We're talking about a product named "baby powder." It's not just talc. It's 99% talc, which is carcinogenic. It has asbestos in it, which is carcinogenic. It has heavy metals in it, which are known carcinogens, and it has silica in it, which is a known carcinogen, so I liken baby powder as a delivery device of multiple carcinogens, exactly like a cigarette. SPEAKER: The senator from Massachusetts. SEN. KENNEDY: A technique that has been used to extract ovarian tumour material found talc particles in approximately 75% of ovarian tumours examined. Subsequent evaluations have appeared to support the contention of an association between talc and ovarian carcinoma. ALAN: J&J, I consider as the ultimate villain in this situation, and I want to say clearly why. After we filed Deane Berg's suit in South Dakota in federal court, I sent a request for production of documents. My office was stacked with six, seven feet high of papers all around my office, and I went through every single piece of paper. ♪ ALAN: It was absolutely shocking internal material. ♪ ALAN: I'm talking about decades, going back to the 50s... 60s. That they were seeking a replacement for talc in the 60s. And in the same document, they're admitting that talc cannot be safely absorbed in the vagina. And so they were looking for that replacement because of that very reason. They told no one. And then I've seen them go and use their corporate influence to prevent governmental regulation. ♪ ALAN: Not ever in tobacco litigation, in benzene litigation, not in asbestos litigation, has there been an email or a letter memorializing a conspiracy to this scale. They're going out and having side meetings with certain officials at the FDA, to prevent the FDA from regulating their product. ♪ ALAN: If that is not the definition of a villain, I don't know what is. TARA: With so much information available about everything we come in contact with, some true, and some not, it can be hard to know what to pay attention to these days. All of us at Johnson & Johnson deeply sympathize with the women and families impacted by this devastating disease. At the same time, we are guided by the science which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder. DR. NESS: Talc causes ovarian cancer. Johnson & Johnson has known about this for decades. And they refuse to do anything about that. DEANE: So they put me through the deposition, and then we met out in Rapid City, the western part of South Dakota, and they said, "Well, we'll offer you 800,000." And I said, "Well, what about the warning label?" I thought this was all part of it. There was gonna be a warning label, or the product would be taken off the market. No, none of that. And then I'd have to be silent, right? I went out for a walk with my husband at the time, and I said, you know, "We didn't do this for money." I said, "What about all the other women that are out there? "And if I just take money, "what good is this gonna do?" It isn't. So we went back in and they said, "Okay, 1.3 million." And I said no. I stood up, I said, "I'll see you in court in September," and walked out of the room. ♪ DR. DODSON: So, Silent Spring was founded over 20 years ago, by breast cancer activists. ♪ DR. DODSON: We were founded as an institute to try to study the links between the environment and women's health. ♪ DR.

DODSON: So, thanks for coming to Silent Spring, and I'm excited to tell you about our study. MYMY: Yes. DR. DODSON: Have a seat. MYMY: Okay. Basically I wanted to look at the chemical body burden difference between using my normal every-day products versus clean products. So I actually just recently looked at... Started looking at the ingredients in my shampoos, and deodorants... Deodorant's a big one. I keep mentioning it, but because I just use it so often, and there's aluminium, and talc, which I have read in studies that are... That can cause breast cancer, ovarian cancer. So if that's in my deodorant, then what else am I using, and unknowingly causing harm? What do you think is so key to knowing our chemical body burden? DR. DODSON: The key here is that it... We're concerned about exposures during certain time periods in people's lives. Right, so when a woman is pregnant, we're worried about the exposure that might happen in the foetus, right, we're concerned about early life exposures to children, because that can affect their development. But also women, whom then might be of childbearing age. DR. DODSON: Here. You can take a urine sample, and then put it back into the kit, and freeze it, and then once you've frozen it, you can then send it back to us in this shipper, and we pull them all together, and then we send them off to the lab for the chemical analysis.

I'm supposed to be doing a detox day, so no products at all, I just took a shower with no shampoo, no conditioner, no soap. It was the weirdest thing ever. And I'm not using any toothpaste, and my breath's gonna smell. I can't use deodorant either, and it's... 80 degrees outside, so I gotta remember to stay at least like 20 feet away from everyone. ♪ MYMY: So I felt really dirty all the time. No, I can't use soap, I can't wash my hands. And people would try to talk to me, and I would just look really awkward, because I'd back away from people. ♪ MYMY: But detox for 24 hours, no use of any products. And then after the detox period, use your normal products. ♪ MYMY: I never thought about the volume of the products that I was using. Eyebrows, lipstick, shampoo, conditioner, shaving. I lost count when I was using them, but I think upwards of 27 products. ♪ MYMY: I'm actually gonna look at every single label on every product that I've used. Just make a full spreadsheet of which products have what, and then create categories on which ingredients show up most often. If I do show a really high level of chemicals, I don't know, parabens, phthalates, I really want to look into what disruptions does this cause in my endocrine or reproductive system? If I can find enough data, if I can pool enough data to show that these chemicals are very harmful, then I would take it even further. And really, tell the public, "Hey, this is what we're doing to our bodies, "and we need to stop." ♪ STACY: The stories we're hearing about today, about chemical pollution, about toxic plastic waste, about rising rates of cancer, aren't just problems that are happening out here that somebody needs to deal with. But they're as close to us as the choices we're making every single day, about the lotions that we put on our faces, and the bubbles that we put in the bathtub with our children. STACY: So we started the Cosmetics Campaign out of a concern about a particular chemical called phthalates, which is linked through a long body of research to reproductive birth defects, and particularly, impacts on the male reproductive system. We found out in the early 2000s, through the Centers for Disease Control, they started to analyze urine of thousands of Americans. Everyone is being exposed to phthalates, but they found much higher levels in women of child-bearing age, 20-40. The researchers that I worked with had a theory, it could be cosmetics. So we sent 72 products to a lab... this was in 2002... And found phthalates in most of them. Two thirds of the products. Then we reported that at a press conference, we actually had a full-page ad in The New York Times. The headline was, "Sexy for her. "For baby, it really could be poison." This was a bomb in the cosmetics industry. Nobody had been asking here, in the United States, about toxic chemicals in cosmetics. SCOTT: Last week I got to spend a day on Capitol Hill with a very brave little girl named Eliana. Eliana lost all of her hair, even her eyelashes. You can add pretty much anything to personal care, in any amount. And sometimes, as we saw with a popular shampoo, sold by a celebrity hairstylist, tens of thousands of women and girls lost some or all of their hair, some permanently. MONICA: And I was just very, very, very shocked and disappointed that this company that makes so much money off of this product cannot be responsible for what they've done. And it's... sorry. [crying] My family has just seen the worst. My hair falling out, and my husband... I had to make a difficult decision for him to go ahead and shave my hair off. [crying] Sorry. PAUL: I would say it was a pretty horrific experience. There's a product called "Just For Men." It's their product that's used for beards. COMMERCIAL: "Just For Men" hair and beard care. Be the better man you are. PAUL: By the time I got to bed that night around 10, 10:30, the mild itchiness had progressed to an unbelievable itchiness. I made the decision immediately, we've gotta go over to Emerg. SCOTT: There are certainly acute risks, short-term risks from using personal care, whether it's hair loss, or burns, or contaminated products, or products with too much lead, or mercury. SCOTT: But there are also chronic or long-term risks that have been linked to cancer, or fertility. [women singing] [protesters shouting] SCOTT: It's hard to imagine that there are rules that limit what chemicals we can spray on food, or on crops, but not the chemicals we spray on ourselves every day. ALEC: So a large part of my job as a formulator was to constantly do reformulations. Once a certain dye was thought to be... Even potentially to have toxicities, they wouldn't wait for it to become a regulatory matter, they would be proactive in reformulation. But I see bath products, and shampoos, and 3-in-1s, and a lot of bath type of products for kids. Which I have two nephews and a niece that I love very much. When I see their mother soaking them in this product every night for hours on end, it does concern me, because they're not just taking a quick shower and washing it off. They're soaking in it, and playing in it. All women who wear any kind of deodorant, or some moisturizer, is gonna have parabens in their system for the last 50 years. But then the marketing department got a hold of this, and thought, "We're gonna be the first product "that has no parabens," so then they substitute it with another preservative: methylchloroisothiazolinone. And now it's proven to be toxic. ♪ ROSE MARIE: I never set out to be a makeup artist. I was travelling all over the world, I've lived in Paris, London, Berlin, Hamburg, New York, Miami, all doing makeup.

ROSE MARIE: Open... ROSE MARIE: And in my 30s, I started feeling really, really sick. I had problems with a lot of the makeup because it was burning my skin when I'd do full body makeup on the girls, and I'd take it off with a makeup wipe, my arms literally would break out into a rash. And I so I went and had really advanced bloodwork, urine analysis, and hair analysis. And when I picked that up from the lab, they said to me, "Do you work in the cosmetic industry?" And I was like... I was completely in shock, and I said, "How do you know that?" And they said, "'Cause we see a lot of these chemicals in cosmetics, "and also people that do hair." So I started studying all this. I got so involved in that, people were saying, "Oh my god, if you put this out, you'll never work again "in the industry."

CRAMER: Alan tells me the story that the lawyer for the defence said, "You've got about a one in a million chance "of winning this." DEANE: One person versus a humongous pharmaceutical company. REPORTER: They became the first to file a talc lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, and its talc supplier. ALAN: It was truly David versus Goliath. They had 20 or 30 lawyers on their side, and it was me. DARREN: The science, as the FDA sees it, simply does not merit such a warning at this time. DR. NESS: And they just keep coming back at us with, oh my gosh, more and more crack legal teams. They are really swift. REPORTER: The FDA also did say, though, the growing body of evidence to support a possible association between genital talc exposure and serious ovarian cancer is difficult to dismiss. DARREN: God bless 'em. DEANE: So it went to court in September. And that was probably one of the hardest weeks I ever had. BART: The truth, as we will show you over the next three weeks or so, is that Johnson's Baby Powder, which has been sold to millions of people around the world for over 100 years, are absolutely safe, do not cause ovarian cancer. There have been no studies saying that it does. DEANE: They put up big poster boards of women's internal organs. And they talked about sperm going up the vagina, and then it was how talcum powder couldn't do this, because, you know, how could it ever get up inside of a woman? DR. CRAMER: I don't think women need a lesson about the anatomy, but just as sperm can track up, and just as the egg, fertilized, can track down, it's pretty easy for a particle like talc to track through the genital area. DEANE: And they had slides of my ovarian tissue, with purple spots where there was talcum all through it. Johnson & Johnson had doctors that testified against me. One doctor even laughed, "She's lucky to be alive." BART: You are in fact going to learn in this case that the hard science studies actually show that talc kills cancerous cells, and leaves normal cells alone.

I can't wait for this legislation to pass, for people to stop dying. Thank you so much.
