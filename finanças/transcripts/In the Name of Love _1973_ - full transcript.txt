Do not leave me, I beg you, Promise me Yes. Swear. Good morning, sir. I called the car. No, let's walk a little. It's not wise to walk around, it's better to go by car. I just want to go to the restaurant to eat a good sandwich. Then we go back to take the car to go to the airport. So we can arrive on time to Geneva for lunch with the minister. Look here, a photo. Niko! Are you coming because of Harmakolas? I do not even use your gas for the car. I only use Shell. - And why did they call you? - Let me in. Wait until they tell me and then I can tell you. - You promise? - While, listen. Come and see me Then I tell you everything. " Bang bang show Do you recognize it? Yes! I think S.

I started earning m0ney..more and more than I thought. I have always had contracts, responsibilities. Jean Daniel just wanted continue with the life of always: I prefer to leave it before getting in That is why he is here as a witness. Famous and friendly, with thousands of fans who adore him. My daughter also has a room full of albums and posters of her own. While Jean Daniel... But what has he done? That motorcycle... He was not Harmakolas's bodyguard? Yes! - S, but... - Discutieron. He was fired and threatened to take revenge. He promised that one day he... "would crack from top to bottom Oh, yes? Already. And that? They are just things that are said. Maybe, but sometimes they are made. Harmakolas's killer was on that motorcycle. We have the description of his secretary. We found it on the Paris-Lyon railway line, So, in that state. Jean Daniel is from Lyon. What's the matter with him? My God! In what state it is! They are always so when a train rolls over. Sometimes worse. At least, this one is whole. Poor Jean Daniel.

Are you the fucking Deputy Director of Cipriani Prison ? - Who? - It is not your interest and let us talk. We have kidnapped your wife. You understand? If you want to see her alive again, do what we tell you. We have a friend in your prison: Called Milo Ruiz. Third wing, number 3742. We want it out, or you will not recognize your wife or in the final judgment. Say? Police, who speaks? Police. Who speaks? Who speaks? Milo Ruiz, by Pablo Ruiz and Jeanne Durand, born in Casablanca on 160f4 of 1946. F/ed from the Foreign Legion in 1970. Arrested pending trial for attempted kidnapping together with accomplice still not located. Good evening, director. What kind of man is Milo Ruiz? A hard one, but it goes to yours. If it were organized, we would have problems. I want to see him. Ruiz, get up. And throw the cigar. I was dreaming of Raquel Welch. G0 out and leave me alone with him. Move on. I like to receive people. Sit as in house. Who are they? Who are your friends? Who are you in contact with? I want the name of your friends. It is wrong!! I no longer have friends. Who wants you to leave? He will be my lawyer. Yes. Who else wants me out of here? Or some honest citizen who believes in justice. I am a victim of a judicial error and you know it. - Bring it to my office. - Ruiz? No, the other. Who are Ruiz's friends? With whom did you have contact in Milan before being captured? It's okay. Butyou“. If you talk, you do not move. Milo was not long in Italy. He hit it with a friend, but he has not told me his name or where he is. Was he Sicilian? No, French. They came from France - both. - On whom did he rely? - Who was he in contact with? - With nobody that I know. The only name I've heard is "the Grappa Hey, what are you doing here? You should try harder to remember it. I am always ready to serve the law. What should I think when the Deputy Director of the jail comes with the manners of a bad cop? Listen man... I'm clean I'll give you 10-year-old bastard. The boys can stand 1O years I do not. You can not even make a crime that I confess... without tearing it off. You will give me a confession now. - Who wants to get Ruiz out and protects him? - No one. Ruiz is not a regular. Give a blow and then disappear. It reappears in the Middle East as a bodyguard of some Sheikh and then rest maintained by some rich. Milo does not care about the profession. Sometimes it hits a headline, and others steal money from a neighborhood cinema. Someone who does that does not have a " papaito " behind. Well, there is someone very interested in his escape. I heard one on the phone. He faked the voice, but he was Sicilian. Can it be the mafia? It's something else. If he has contact with Ruiz, he can only be an outside Sicilian. They come for a single blow, with a contract They are professionals, Italian assassins. We were a delayed country, but Look,cop. You do not have that much time. Get Milo Ruiz out ofjail and fast. If not, we'll end up getting angry with your little wife. Say hello to your husband. Tell him how good you are. Vito! Help me, Vito. Help me, my love. Help me. Pleasel! Have you heard? Your wife is tired of us. And we of you. And do not go near the police. If you do something to him, I do not denounce you, I kill you. Even if I have to chase you to the end of the world. Now listen to me well... Send Milo Ruiz to the visiting room. Bring me quickly to Milo Ruiz. Agreed walk and close and no one enters until I call. Now you can escape. Ask to go to the doctor, and get ready for 8. And let's hope someone he allows it... Hey, Ruiz! Better go to sleep. Tomorrow you will have x-rays. That they make me a thousand copies, 18 x 24, for my admirers. Pudrite. Hello, doctor, I was looking for you. Hi, brigade, what's wrong? One of the usual incidents. One prisoner fell down the stairs. Wow! I said you had to put a carpet. It's hurt? Tomorrow at any time. No, it will be better after visiting time. Brigade! I want to come here! What do you want? I want to be clean for x-rays. You send me to the bathroom? Fantuzzi Brigade. Brigade, Mr. Deputy Director Cipriani needs you in his office. Goes up! Goes up! Be careful, if you try something, I'll break your legs. I promise. And with all the right. Did he make me flee because he needs to grab a fugitive to ascend? Get in there. Call your friends. Tell them you are free and I do not let you go until I have my wife. Come on, move! I do not know who to call. Listen to me well, carrion. I have fulfilled my part. Give me the name of your friends or I swear I'll blow your head off. But I do not know who they are. You must believe me... You'll see I do not know. And why did you continue the game? I thought there was a possibility in the air. What the fuck. Try to think. Do an effort. You must tell me which of your friends may have organized something like that. Of course I'm thinking. But I do not have friends like that around here. I buried the only one I had. But if someone. He has done all this to get me out, he will appear. The sooner you leave me. Meanwhile, you will continue with me. I'm glad for it... What a place for a Deputy Director! It's like being in the George V de Paria. Is it from your savings or did you win the lottery? - Shut up. - If I do not speak, I fall asleep. You're a smartass, are not you? Who would look for a fugitive at home Shut up! Turn off the light, I'm sleepy. Do not try again, or next time I'll sleep you forever. Now sit down! Sit down! What do you do here at this time? Mr, He knows that I love him. He has done a lot for me in the past... What are you trying to tell me? Milo Ruiz has eloped while you were calling. I have already been asked many questions, and I have not spoken, I have not said a word. But tomorrow I get a disciplinary commission. How do ljustify - I told you the truth: That I called you. - But you were not there. They will answer about you, about the talks - And everything else. - I have nothing to hide! - Say? - Has "the merchandise"? All right'? Yes. Very good. They have kidnapped my wife. To force me to get Ruiz out. I need help and a little time to catch those pigs and put them in jail. Yes of course. I want to give myself the pleasure of catching a criminal again. I help you. Like when we were at the police station. We have put many wives. He remembers? Are they. They do not trust. They are afraid that you have called the police. "Doubtful sweep In jargon it is called like this: They have " photographed us They already know what we are. Check it out! Shut up, - Do you know him? - I have not seen him in life. Release Milo Ruiz. Send him here. I used to let my wife loose. Has not come. Very risky. I already risked too much helping to escape a criminal. I have fulfilled my part. Complete yours. I do not loose Ruiz until he has my wife. We do not have instructions for that. Well, I give you the instructions, pigs! G0 find my wife! And bring it before an hour, or tomorrow I'll lock your friend. And do not think I will not find you. Even if I have to put the country upside down, I will find you. You can be sure. Now go! Tell him to leave! You will have the answer in one hour. Now, get out! We do not want you to follow us. Let go of me and I give you my word that you are returned to your wife! I do not believe in the word of a criminal. You are my only guarantee. I'm Fantuzzi. Yes, I'm calling from a phone near where they are. County Paullese, yes. Hears? That pig of your husband has called the cop. Do not! Drop me! What are you going to do to me? Piety! Do not! Do not! Stay! Acting without my orders? If you have discovered your duty was to find another. I have not given you orders of kill. I do not leave dead people there, like you. You are not professionals. It's too late. You have to make it disappear, You are going to disappear. Take the first train and return to town. Here you are finished. The girl stays with me. Now I will continue with the game. And the risk is mine. Be careful not to leave traces. Clean everything well and then go away. Now you will write to your husband. Any phrase. Only to see that you are alive. At least the Sicilians have done something: They have put you in the right frame of mind. I'm sure you'll be fine. Fix yourself a little. We're going away. Between the people. The body can not be touched before lifting. Is he your relative? Did you know him? He was probably hit by someone. But nobody has seen the accident. It does not carry papers. We do not know who he is, probably a Vagabond, Better than you, and much better than me. It's the road police, with the usual 2O minutes of delay. Vito mi amor: I hope I can hug you, that it's the end of this sad story... and to get together. Do not abandon me... lbeg you... Anna. The riddles give me a headache. They've killed a poor man so you can run away. I swear that as you do not tell me anything I'll shave you. Do not hurt yourself! With a little kindness, I could help you. What does this mean? It's the name of a Frenchman who lives in Milan. He is your friend? Do not, It is one that passes information. But not regularly. Then you know who has planned this. Speaks! I have no idea. But surely he does know. I am sorry. It must be an error. I have never seen this young man. Come on, Joe. Leave it now. If they have left your name it is because I should come to see you. Now tell me what you know, or the henchman destroys the school. I do not understand what they are talking about. But if it is a threat, I advise you to leave. - Otherwise, I'll call the police. - Lame it. Call the police. And what do I tell him? What do I have a fugitive in school accompanied by the director who has helped him elope? Stop. They told me to give you this. Look at you. You also understand who it is. Come, henchman. Defend yourself. Or do you only know how to hit the weak? Come, police, defend yourself! Take the key to the handcuffs. It's in the right pocket. They're waiting for you in Paris, but they did not think you could get rid of the policeman. They took his wife. Now you have to fix it. He knows too much. No alternative. What's wrong? It will not be the first time you kill. You will not say that I am the first. Shut up! What are you waiting for to shoot? I've seen so many murderers. But never someone who becomes one. Shut up bastard! Shut up! If I do not kill you, what will you do? Would you call the police? Then I must kill you. I love my wife! You believe in the law like the Pharisees in confession. They do what they want And on the 7th they are going to fix accounts. And me? Will you try to lock me up? Will you cleanse your conscience with me? I love my wife. Help me find it and I will forget you forever. I hope you find it. You have so much to learn. This is the first lesson... Have you seen the registration? It's my car... it has my name I'd like to call myself Onassis, but I'll settle for Rockefeller. Be that as it may, a passport. No, that's a good man. Then it's worth more. 500. - And where do I get them? - Do you ask me? Or you let me steal some gas stations or take out your savings. We are coming to my house. - When they canceled the game... - The Inter... Friend, you learn soon. We become partners and we are Bonnie and Clyde. Now they are looking for me too. Do not think it. It is only bad at the beginning. Then you get used to it. With the bombs, we are in a state of siege. That's what these damned people do that we do with a false passport. You have to find another way. Something not to be expected. The problem is which one. Which? If you're right... I know one thing, where we go we should mix with people and go unnoticed. Come that girl with curly hair I knew this route like the palm of my hand. - And why are you running away? - I do not run away, I'm leaving. I'll come back later. There are no longer places to flee. But if you have to help someone, I help you. - And you get it? - Sometimes. Do not you ask me why I run away? It is better not to ask. There is! - Hello. - Hello. Come. - They are ready? - List... Hi. Are you Loucille? - Hello. - Okay, let's go. - Lenelo. - It's okay. It's cold now. - Tired? - I'm not cold. Hey where are we going? OOh... we have visit you have fire'? Give me the list. G0 to the truck. Let's move on. Agree! Come on! Still! If we continue here, we screw it up. To the forest! You were very good last night... And to think that I almost killed a man. One who earns bread like me. But at that moment I did it without even being aware. I saw you while you were driving. You were satisfied with yourself, of your good eye. You had a lot of confidence in yourself... real confidence. You like danger. You are doing very well. What is the difference with being - What do you do? - Transfer. They will not charge us for doing it because it turns out that this is my house. Ahead. We cross the plain running. Come on! Down! They are French. We are finally in France. It's the police! Separate yourself! Better not get caught with me. See you in Paris. I have business to do. - Come! - I'll find you, goodbye! Enough! Cut! That's OK! I recorded it thinking of you, Milo. In Jean Daniel and all the friends. "A friend is a friend forever." And what are you doing here? I believed you in jail. I came thanks to you, friend. When they calm down, let's talk about my side of the deal. Who is that guy so sad'? It looks like a dog without a house... I'm sick of going with a cop stuck to my ass. Because they do not give back to his wife and it's over, back to Milan. I know nothing... Look friend, he's a guard and heavy, he can break you... What the fuck are you talking about? Look listen to me. Someone kidnapped the woman of this type to force him to plan my escape. And Joe the Corso told me to come to see you Al. If you are afraid to speak because he is there, quiet. He is already worse than us. Come on. Who would have bothered me so much? I have only had two friends: You and Jean Daniel. And since he is dead, only you are... Who told you that Jean Daniel is dead? Have you seen anyone else in Paris? I did not have to see anyone. He was with me in Milan. They killed him when he did a job with me the poor bastard was under a pile of stones. - I did not want to go to the warehouse. - You're joking! Jean Daniel was in France. And he died assaulted by a train when he fled after killing his ex-boss Harmakolas. I recognized his corpse And the bike was - the one I gave him. - Are you crazy! Jean Daniel never killed anyone. - Who did you recognize? - To the! It was Jean Daniel! Did you look at him well? To the face? You did not do it, right? Then you better go to the police. Tell them you were wrong... to be unearthed both to see who Jean Daniel is. Have you come to incriminate me? Is it blackmail? You want money? Taking. Take this and disappear! Who do you think you are, piece of shit? You lied when you recognized Jean Daniel - and now you're in the shit. - Shut up! Who ordered you to do it? Now get my wife out, or I swear I'll tear you to pieces. You're in this, so hurry. It is understood? I give you three hours. It's all the time you'll have... Those are your friends, right? These are the people I have to trust. Congratulations the price is reasonable .. We will make a fortune many become millionaires with a music store. Provided it is well managed, of course. Excuse me - Please. There are two new girls. They want to see you are new. Do you want to see them? - Hello. - How are you? Hello. Give me your coat -If it's clear. - You are free tonight? - For you, yes. Here Mr. Bronson, it's all yours. My dear... I'm going. I can not stay... I'll leave the house. Why? What happens? Cancel my commitments and collect all the money you can. Find me a contract anywhere, as long as I can go very far and be in a few hours outside of Paris. I do not know... I'll see how to make those arrangements. Fix them. And fast. G0 away! Nervous? Something is wrong? I have problems. I want to leave. Why? I can not tell you why. Help me. Find me a place where they do not find me. If I'm looking for you, one more will already know. It's me you're trying to escape. What do you mean? I was the one who sent Ruiz out. And I ordered Joe the Corsican to send it to you. Running away does not make sense. That's it. It has been following us for a long time. It was sent to us by Al's pig. He is afraid that we denounce him. They have us to throw like in the fair. Separate us. You go with the car. You will see how they follow me. Then you turn back and come to pick me up. - Who do we follow? - A Milo. And good? What did Milo Ruiz tell you? I did not know you were in this. Why did you send it to me'? He was your friend. With you I would have spoken. I do not want to continue with this story. I do not understand why you want to put me in the middle. Because you already are. You lied when you recognized a corpse. And you knew it. You have made a name for yourself with things like that. You became someone because we imposed you, because you were from ours. And we make you disappear when you are not already. I want to know what happened to Jean Daniel, that's all. Is dead. He died in a robbery, Milo buried him under a pile of stones. I did not want them to find the body. In Italy, somewhere. Then everything is in order. They can not find him there. And the one who killed Harmakolas will still be Jean Daniel. That investigation should not - Up to what point? - Do not ask questions. And do not try to see what there is You answer to me. And I answer only before the one behind me. Agree? - Yes? - Hey, idiot. Stop letting us continue. Or you tell me now everything you know or I'll forget you were a friend. Listen to me Milo... I feel what has happened. But now, everything is fixed. Tell that policeman if he wants his wife, who is in an hour at Place Beleville, OK. When you get rid of him, come and see me, I have some girls... You win. Calm down. What are you afraid of? Not me, of course. I just come To be cleaned. You can not go out like that. In Paris and with me, no. It seems that one more tourist has arrived. Your husband is here. Then will you let me go? We have a date. We will all be. Still no trust. But some things are solved like that. I insist that it is a trap. If not, I would have asked for guarantees. Like they ask me later. If you do not trust, why did you come? It's the only way to know if my wife is alive. You are a poor man. Come on, they've brought your wife. Make the exchange and finish. Be careful, Milo! Car! God! Help me! Take me to the hospital! Please come with you! Take me to the hospital. Do not leave me here! It is impossible... we have been wrong. Those people. He made you escape just to kill you. Enough, I'm fed up! Gross. I take you to the police and I leave everything in your hands. Do not. It's useless. If you lock me up, they'll kill your wife. And to me, they will find a way to kill me sooner or later. We must solve this. US. As men. Together! Take me to Al's house. Take me to your house! You will not get it. Look to you. Where does the girl live? The one on the border. Where is? No, let's not get into this. We have to hide somewhere. They will persecute us. And if the cop catches us with the stolen car we are screwed Where is? Furstenberg Square, 6. Hey, you should be a professional nurse you make Me Feel good. I did not feel like that for a long time, just keep pressing like this... you forget a lot of things in jail certain feelings and emotions because you're locked. Thanks friend. To Niko? Vito Cipriani. Listen to me, worm. Now you can not say - that you're not in this. - Tell that bastard. When I see him, I crush his brains. That I did not know. I know what you wanted to know, and why did you want to kill him? It's over. It's okay. Agree. Now you are the strongest. Give us Milo and we give back to your wife. There are no more deals. I love my wife, period. Come for her. Is here. No, I do not trust! You will trust her. Vito. They say they are fed up They will release me if you do not report them. If you can help me, please help me. I beg you. I can not take anymore. Anna, do not be afraid. They can not hurt you anymore, I swear to you. Anna, please do not worry. It is just what we want. Come for her and then... get out I want to talk to my wife. What will you do with me when they return it to you? I do not want to end with them! - Will you hand me over? - I do not care what you do... Destroy, kill like animals. He sweats it! I want to get out of this shit and forget that it exists. His wife is far away now, These are photocopies. The originals have someone who waits only one order to register them and make them operational. For example, here... seen the evidence presented and the testimonies heard, his wife is accused of killing Niko. Here, admitted in a psychiatric clinic, for an excessive dose of heroin. This will interest you. Here his wife does not exist for us. She is a young, free girl, who is in Paris with your husband to spend a vacation that starts... morning. You just have to choose. You're a fucking bastard. You are framed, henchman. You can only accept my conditions. Al Niko has finished his role. The curtain has fallen on him. If you agree, your death may seem accidental and you get away with your wife. But first you must tell me where Milo Ruiz is. You want to kill him. You want to kill him! And you can not do anything. You can not stop the gear. Where is Milo Ruiz? He would be an accomplice to a homicide. So, you do it. Kill him, Mr. Cipriani, it's the only way... Milo is condemned, he has no escape. You can not hide when you know something about the death of a man like Harmakolas. Better that a friend kill you. Better to die in the square as a bull than in the slaughterhouse. Milo would understand, and he would. Is not my style. Nevertheless, if you kill Milo everything is solved alone. We have the guarantee that you will not speak. And you, that we have no reason not to let you go. And the one behind me you will be sure that the Harmakolas case will never be reopened. I will become a hit man. No, you will not be. You are an official who has followed a fugitive. And you shoot him to catch him. It is your law. Do you want witnesses to say that it was in self-defense? I can get them. Do you want a favorable report from the police? - I can give it to you. - Ud is a liar! You are just a criminal. You can not do all this. Mr. Cipriani, I have behind me people so powerful that I could annihilate you, destroy you for a thousand generations. Think carefully about what you will do. Remember that you can not afford mistakes. We'll leave... when this whole thing is over. No, you can not help me here... it's better not to worry about you... Listen to me... people in the world do not believe in gangsters, you know? There are other behaviors... you do not see it Milo now there is politics in the capitalism the interests of the class are watched... they betray the people for their benefit and the lower classes hate them look at the Kennedys, Trosky. I have not thought about the political angle .. You are a smart girl. You know? There is only one way for you... tell the truth to as many people as possible that the whole matter be made public taking it to the press and in that I can help you, I have contacts. I know people you can talk to listen to me Milo, I can help you fix this but the system can go back to the Middle Ages can cause a strong blow I care little what can happen to society. I want to make a deal with Harmakolas If... make a proposal and then to become a great chef in Switzerland I want to say that I want great plans for me and take part of them Those damn bastards. Yes... and now? I thought you could go for a decent way. To feel respect for something .. I was wrong everything will remain the same as long as there are people like you to remind me... What are you going to do? I have to work, my train leaves in an hour. Hey Paula, where are you going? What do you care, anyway you will not be when I get back. Yes, where will I be? In the morgue. They'll kill you and when you're dead I'll find you a decent suit to bury you. We'll see each other in hell! You do not know what it means for me to come here. I am Vito Cipriani, deputy director of the prison in Carasco, ltalia. I helped... I helped an inmate to escape. And I have come to deliver myself. I do not care what happens to me, I need you to help me. They kidnapped my wife. And only you can save it. - They kidnapped his wife? - Yes. Do you want to explain yourself better? Who? Can you give me names? No no. But they were at the house ofAl Niko, the singer. Do something or they will kill her too. Understands? He says his wife's kidnappers have killed Al Niko. - Yes. - According to his statements they have made a montage so that she seems guilty. Well, for us, Niko's death was totally accidental. It is not true. They killed him! We found the syringe with which he killed himself. There were only his prints. They try to make me look like a crazy man who is hallucinating It's all a trap so you do not talk and do not know who killed Harmakolas... You can see it! I risk the life of my wife and you, you bastards, They waste time and do nothing. Enough! Come gentlemen... Thanks Claude, you can go forward... come on... Feel. Mr. Cipriani... I believe in its history. I have done research in Italy you will see... and all the reports that I received I imagine how a man of his character can only tell the truth Obviously he loves his wife very much, And I suppose how much it would have cost to come to see us. We know at this moment that in which Milo Ruiz comes to testify, they Will kill his Wife. And it is normal for you to be reticent, of course, to deliver to Ruiz. You can not put life of a young and innocent woman, at the same level as a vulgar criminal. You must know. Here I have your statement, but before that the firm that explains all the risks to which it would expose Harmakolas was an oil magnate, the interests of its category. He kept deceiving himself with being able to change the balance, break the established order. The society he had to defend himself moving a disturbing element away from his own body. That said, it seems almost a bureaucratic operation. A little cross next to a name, Not a dead man on a street. You were commissioner of the mobile patrol, and now vice director of a prison. That create problems for the interests and welfare of the community. Is it more than a bureaucratic operation? No, maybe it is not, but at least we deal with the problem. That can not say it. Too often it happens that you and all the police in the world they use a weapon... when arresting a criminal, avoid a leak, contain a riot. And on many occasions, someone is dead. And it's just that it's like that, it's inevitable. In the name of the law, to maintain the integrity of the society that elected you to defend it.

Nothing in the world can destroy us and I assure you that we will achieve it... - Once in life. - If you go to the press I do not care about you or I even your wife! I do not care who dies as long as we keep this matter open. Vito. Vito, look at me. It's true, I'm just a criminal, but I'm willing to take a chance. Give me that opportunity! Come on, Vito. Please! It would not be. It's useless, Milo. It's useless. God no. For. For. Do you want... Milo. Do not look at me like that! During an armed conflict, he was forced to kill the fugitive Milo Ruiz in self defense. As you will see, the report very favorable Surely he will be judged with benevolence.
