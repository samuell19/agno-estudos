Fresh coat of paint? -Yes. Tell me more... -About Assen, you mean? Yes. -Yes, God... look... Assen, just has it all. -Yes, I thought as much. It sounds like a really nice city. The way you talk about it. Hey, sluttie... wake up. That's nice. -Yes, isn't it? No more sleeping, honey. I have to go. -Yes. Bye. -Bye. Hi. -Hey, Chantal. Make us some coffee, hon? -Yes. You're looking pale. Yes? -Here, new vitamins. Thank you. Good? Wait a sec. Chantal speaking. Now? Ok. I'm glad you came after all. Yes, I enjoyed it a lot. -Me too. You're very beautiful. Can I say that? Yes, always. My room's upstairs. Didn't the agency say that I...? -What? I don't do that. But I thought that... -That's a misunderstanding. No, don't, please. Talk to the agency, alright? Bye bye. Oh, child... how do you get your nails so beautiful? They're not real. -Really? Let me see. Oh, that's beautiful. Can't you do that for me too? You'll have to wait until I have my own salon. I'm talking to a few banks about a loan. It's not going very fast, though. Yes, big plans. I'll get my own little corner for hairdressing. I hope you'll succeed, girl. It sounds hard. Especially if you also want children, or don't you want them? Yes, I want it all. My own business and children, a boy and a girl. Damien and Brooke. No, actually, Damien and Jennifer. Maybe Brooke sounds to brookey? Last week, it was Brooke. -I know, but it changed. One moment. Chantal. Enjoy. Oh, is it that long ago? Yes, a year and a half ago. That's when we had our first date. Time flies, doesn't it? I taught you to eat snails, remember? The first night. Yes, I remember very well. I was disgusted at first. Yes. Do you still eat them? -Yes, very often. Well... sometimes. Brigitte? Do you want to marry me? Seriously. Will you be my wife? -Max... You know how much I love you, but you shouldn't say these things. Will you think about it at least? -Do you have any idea... I'm certain that you also want to marry me. Have I ever told you how rich I am? But it's not about... -Everything added up... ...real estate, personal property, shares, I'm worth about 6 million. And there's something else. I have a tumour in my head. The doctors are giving me half a year at most. So? -So, in half a year... ...we'd be millionaires six times over. -Why on earth does he want that? He wants to enjoy the time he has left, to the max. And he's crazy about me. He only wants to do fun things in the company of a beautiful women... ...and then die. What nonsense is that? Was that guy drunk or something? We'll talk about it later. When's the fair? I want to go again. This autumn. Don't you know everything about pills? Everything, Uncle Piet. I'll check my big book... My hip's causing me trouble. -Oh. How's that? Have you thought about it? Yes. And? What kind of type is he? -Over 60. Nice, decent and rich. And did his wife die or something? Divorced, no children. Lonely, like most. Imagine... How would it go with... uhm... With what? -Would you have to go to bed with him? You always said: no big deal. I'll go out with them... ...tell them what they want to hear and that's all. Do you think I like it? I hate it. Half a year, Robin. What's half a year? Take a deep breath and it's over. How can we be sure that it's true what he's saying? Do those children have cancer too? My real name's Chantal. Mr. Jacobsen. My name's Wessel. I'm afraid I have little to add to our last conversation. Even if you won't get better, we'll continue the treatment... ...to make the time you have left as pleasant as possible. The prognosis? Still the same? We can never be sure, but you should take into account... ...that it could also be shorter than half a year. Why? Am I not good for you? Don't I pay enough? No, I'm... I'm getting married. Are you pregnant? Did he finally ask you? I'm not marrying Robin. Listen. Can you keep a secret? Seriously. And stay out of it. Even though that's hard for you? No more cockroaches, Robin. I don't know if I can handle you in bed with that dirty old man. You won't have to do it. I'll be doing it. As long as I'm able to do it. Well? We'll just have to bite the bullet for half a year... ...and we'll be done, darling. Forever. Not we, you. -You too. You too, Bear. Do you promise to love her for better or for worse... ...in sickness and health, until death do you part? What is your answer? Yes. And you, Chantal Louise Lovers. Do you promise to love Wessel Simon Jacobsen for better or for worse... ...in sickness and health, until death do you part. What is your answer? Yes. Then I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Chantal? One thing. I'm not so stupid to think you have feelings for me. No, don't say anything. You're professional. I appreciate that. You know your trade. We're going to have a good time, during the months that I have left. But it won't always be easy, Chantal. I expect one thing from you... For the time I have left, you'll do everything for me. I hope you'll be able to do that. I'll do my best. My very best. Goodnight. -Thank you. Welcome to your own home. Thank you. I want to show you something. Ok. I'd like for you to put this on and then come downstairs. Take of your panties. My darling. Hey... What is it? -Nothing, I'm happy to see you. Where did you get that car? -A present. Come, I don't have much time. -How was it? Tell me. Well, tell me. Why are you crying? What's wrong? It's hard. He's nice to you, isn't he? -Very hard. Hold me a bit longer. Bear... -Yes? I have to go somewhere with him. Where? He's asleep. -Again? He always has an afternoon nap. What's it like in the Netherlands? Is it raining again? It's alright. -Oh... Bear. I don't know how to get through summer without you. But the house is alright, isn't it? It's ok. I saw some cockroaches. Is he nice to you? If he's not nice, I'll come and get you. Robin, only a couple more months. And he's quite nice. Old and sick. -And at night? Nothing. He's incapable. No, old and sick, like I said. Ok. -Chantal! I have to go. I'll call again soon, ok? Ok. Hey... I had a dream. -Yes. Do you need something? -All those strange things... ...you dream all your life. Things nobody can know. Fantasies. And now my life's almost over. Maybe we should go for a walk up the mountain? Chantal? -Yes? I want to watch you while you're standing in the corner. Head down, arms on your back, like a naughty girl. Wessel... -We're married, aren't we? You were going to do everything for me. We didn't agree... -Like a naughty girl. Eyes closed. Head down. Nose in the corner. Come on. There are limits, damn it. Dirty old fool! Do you want to leave me? Tell me. Do you want a divorce? No. -Do as I say or we'll split up. And I'll get ten lawyers to make sure you don't get a cent What is this? Why are we yelling at each other? How long have we been married? I know it's one-way, but I really love you. I don't ask that much, do I? I just want to look at you. One of those crazy fantasies that I've had all my life. Make it come true for me. While it's still possible. And then... Bare your buttocks. That's the last thing I'll ask. I'm asking very nicely. Please. I love you so much. What's with you? Hey, what's wrong? Know how I have a caravan in Bakkum? -Yes. Turns out the entire bottom has rotted through. I can take it straight to the scrapyard. What about my kids now? A new caravan costs 9000 euros. Where do I get that? And when do you need that thing? Why? Can you keep a secret? I mean, for real? How big is that pool? I don't know. Big enough. Did you know he had that too? That house? No. Hey, Bear... he needed treatment again. That's why we came back. Is he doing poorly? They think it might be a different type of tumour than they thought. And it didn't grow. Didn't grow? I mean that he's not doing worse. The doctor says it may be because he's so happy... with me. Oh, fuck, fucking hell, shit, fuck!! How is that possible? Maybe it'll just take a bit longer? He has another check-up in a few weeks. He has to be doing worse by then. You don't often bring your pretty girlfriend. Did you break up? Just pour me a beer and don't talk so much. Bye, Madam. -Bye, Ferrina. See you tomorrow. Chantal? I really didn't expect this, but I'm very happy for you. I won't change anything. Just keep doing what you're doing. We'll see how far we go. -Thank you. Drive! Drive! How do you like it? -What is this? It's a beemer, baby. A beemer. I've never bought a new car before. -Damn it! What did you do? Relax. I only have to pay in half a year. Sluttie... what's wrong? That fucking tumour is only getting smaller. He's not dying any time soon. He might live another year. Or two of three. I can't handle that, Robin. -Shit, fuck... Chantal! Chantal! Damn it. That wasn't the deal. -What can I say to him? You should have been dead? He was going to die, wasn't he? Wessel Jacobsen was a special man. He didn't have an easy life. He fought a hard battle against a ruthless disease... ...but he received a lot of support from his young, sweet wife. It is a consolation for those who stay behind... ...that he was surrounded by love in his final hours. Chantal speaking. It's me. How was it? -Terrible. Poor darling. I'm coming over tonight. Ok? No. -No, what no? You can't come here now. -Why not? Everything has to be wrapped up first. -I've been sleeping alone for 8 months. A bit more patience. A tiny bit. And I'll call you soon. -Yes, ok. When is she seeing the notary? And... do you know anything or... That caravan. -It'll be alright, Ruud. You're a good guy, Robin. Can I offer you something: coffee, tea? Something else? A glass of water, please. -A glass of water. Margot, one coffee, one water, please. I'd like to extend my sympathy. It went very fast in the end, didn't it? -Yes. And you hadn't been married very long? Eight and a half months. -Eight and a half months. Right. Then we only have to wait for... Wait, I hear something. Oh hi... sorry. My luggage was stuck at Schiphol. Simon Jacobsen. -Let me introduce: Chantal Lovers. -Hi. Can I offer you something? A cup of coffee maybe? No, thanks. How was your flight, apart from the luggage problem? I'll be ok. I'll get myself home. You're not smiling. You're not smiling. -He has a son. The asshole screwed me over. His name's Simon. And he lives in Australia. But God, fuck, shit, bloody hell... how's that possible? I checked all his papers when he was asleep. I never found anything about children. Never. He'll at least get half. His child's portion. But the worst thing is... ...I could see it in his face. He's suspicious. I thought, why stay in that bloody hotel when my father has a huge house... ...with I don't know how many rooms. -It's not really convenient. And it half belongs to me, I thought. Yes. Yes... No, of course. Uhm... come in. I'm not imposing, am I? -No, not at all. Would you like a drink? Sure. A beer? -Yes. Wow... nice mansion. -You've never been here, of course. No, no. Were you close to your father? Yes... a card for my birthday. The first two years. -But did you ever live in the Netherlands? Until the age of ten, but he wasn't rich yet then. Not bad. And it's all ours, Chantal? Married for eight months. You became a widow fast, didn't you? Sad story. And at your age. How much younger are you? 30 years? I won't beat around the bush. It was a deal. He... we knew he was dying. And he was in love with me. He really wanted to get married. And did he ever mention my name? -Yes, he did. What was he like during the last months? He was a sweet man, of course. -Don't lie, Chantal. He was a fucking asshole. What do you mean? How did he die? Uhm... that tumour, you know? I mean, what were his last moments like? It's rather recent. I find it hard to talk about that now. He seems to be doing better. And the treatment was working. And then he got this epileptic fit that killed him. That can happen with a tumour. MEDICATION 2006-2007 You're kidding. What should I have said? -You should have told him to fuck off. Half of it is his, Robin. It's also his house. I don't know what to do anymore. I just don't know anymore. Come and sleep with me tonight. No... that's impossible. Jesus! -Why not? That guy's keeping an eye on me, idiot. He doesn't need to know. -It's impossible, ok? You know what? I don't care. Yes? -Hey, sorry. Ok. -And... be strong. Sleep well, Bear. -You too, sluttie. Hello. Yes, ok. Thank you. Cheers. How did you end up in Australia? My father started a company there and we were going to live there for a year. But then he left my mother. And me. He went back and we stayed. Is your mother still alive? You're my only relative now, Chantal. People here say you're a whore. Sorry? -I was having a look around here. The Dutch start talking about their neighbours, just like that. Are you a whore? I'm going to bed. In Australia, we tell each other things. -What are you thinking? Why do they say that? -How should I know? I'm not a whore and never call me that again. And a five year warranty on waterproofing. But the main thing is that... You look pale. Want a pill of mine? Hello. -Hello. Hello, Madam. -This is Chantal! What's happened to you? Come with me. Chantal speaking. Yes. Where? Ok. Was he a regular customer? -Who? My dad, with you as an escort. How do you know that? Last night, someone called from the 'La Bonne Soirée' agency, or something? I said, Jacobsen speaking. Because that's my name. Then they asked me how I was. They thought I was my father. And then we had a nice chat. Maybe you should have sent them an obituary notice. Why no sex, if I may ask? If you're an escort girl, why don't you go all the way? Doesn't that pay better too? When are you going back to Australia? I have to give my dad one thing: He had good taste. I got it today. MEDICAL FILE Crazy theory, right? It's bullshit, of course, but what the hell. Imagine someone in your situation. You don't want to wait and you think, I'll help him a bit. You said he died of an epileptic fit, right? Phenytoin suppresses fits, unless you take a whole lot of it. Then it works the other way around. Know what I mean? I could, of course, have the body exhumed... ...but I think it would be hard to find any traces. And besides, how can we prove that the widow did it? But it would feel wrong if I didn't do anything. You can't let someone get away with this, don't you think? Maybe it would be best to reach an agreement. Something like: I won't pursue this... ...and in exchange, the widow does something small in return. I'll kill him. -Stop, Bear. I'll kill him. -Stop it. He has to die. -Stop it. That would only make it worse. Then we'd really be screwed. First the old asshole and now his son too. I'll give him what he wants. Last time. No, you won't. He said it was hard to prove. -Do you want to run the risk? What else can I do? How long do we have to bite the bullet? When? When, Chantal? -Why? You've got 3 bloody million in the bank, man. Because the neighbours are right, aren't they? Why don't you admit it? You are a whore. Keep your hands off me. I thought you said your father was an asshole. Talk about assholes... When, Chantal? Tomorrow. Fuck. Yes? -It's me. What do you want? I said tomorrow. I'm going into town... you know? Party a little. Is it also half mine or what? What's wrong with your hand? -Nothing. It's not that bad, I think. -Yes. The keys are on the desk downstairs. Cheers. Oh uhm... tomorrow, right? Hello? -Mrs Lovers? Yes. We have to ask you to come to the station. What's it about? -The death of Mr Jacobsen. Mrs Lovers. Berkhof. Have a seat. Is his son involved in this? -Sorry? Simon Jacobsen. Did he call? -Simon Jacobsen? We found him in the harbour last night. In your car. Strangled. What did you mean when you said: 'Did Simon call?' Uhm... nothing. I was confused when I came in. -I understand. You're a recent widow, aren't you? Did you know the victim well? No, hardly. He lived in Australia. He came over for his father's inheritance. That's my husband. -Your husband was wealthy, wasn't he? Yes. -Are there any other relatives? Except Simon? No. That means you're now the only heir. Yes. -Can we take some blood from you? To compare with traces on Simon's body. Sluttie. -Not here. What? They think I killed Simon. They shouldn't see us together. How can you be so stupid? -What? You've only made matters worse. I didn't do anything. Really. Chantal, why don't you believe me? -Not here. Hello. -Are you home? Yes. You shouldn't call me here. Why? You didn't do anything. -No. Who did? Are you starting again? I'll be with you in an hour. -No. What, no? -You shouldn't come here. Is this ever going to be over? Think about it. I'm a suspect. They're keeping an eye on me. Did you forget what we did? It's now or never again, Chantal. It sure won't be tonight. Bye. Problems again? -No! Everything's ok. All is fine. No, because uhm... I mean uhm... ...it's almost the Christmas holidays and I still don't have a caravan. Can I have another breezer? -Of course. Thank you. Hey. -Hi. Aren't you Robin? -Yes, how do you know? He told me. What else do you know about me? That you've got a really cool car. Fuck, hey! What a car! I often see you in the pub. -Yes, I've seen you too. But you used to date this woman. But not anymore, right? No. -No what? I'm not with her anymore. -Oh. Shall we go bump? Yo! Sorry, sorry. Chantal was just here. She waited for you. She went to your place, but you weren't home. Damn it. Hello? Robin? Hey. -Hi. I rang, but you didn't open. -I didn't want to see anybody. What happened to us? I'll go crazy if we can't trust each other anymore. Tell me you didn't do it. I didn't do it. Who did then? People often get killed at night, in the city. It's quite a coincidence, isn't it? -For the very last time... I didn't do it. I'm not a murderer, am I? No? I so want to believe you... ...but I just know you're hiding something from me. Do you know how I know? -Well? Because I love you so much. And because I know you. I think you don't really understand what's going on. I don't? -If they find out... ...we'll lose everything. Everything will have been for nothing. Understand? Why do you always act as if I'm stupid, Chantal? I'm getting fed up with that. That's not what I want. We have to solve it together. If you love me... You know, maybe... ...maybe I don't love you anymore. Maybe it's all been too much. All those months that I was here on my own and... ...I could never come to you. I think you'd better leave. Chantal... All bank balances are transferred to you. For the shares and the real estate... ...I'd advise you to see an investment manager. And this one. Let me once again extend my sympathy... ...concerning the death of Mr Jacobsen Junior. This is for you. Ha, there's the big BMW driver. Hi. I don't want it anymore. Ho, wait a moment... Hey. You bought that car under contract. Hey, hello... is there any damage? Hey, sluttie. Looks good. ls this all yours? I've come to say sorry. I lied to you a bit. Bloody hell, looks like a real picture. Like in the old days. You lied, you said? Yes and the worst thing was that I said I didn't love you anymore. The thing is I love you more than anything... ...and still. -Don't do that. I had to say that. And the other thing that wasn't true... I had a deal with him. Yes, you were going to get screwed again. For the second time. Darling, what do you think? That he'd have given up on the three million? That he'd just have gone back to Australia? Those guys fooled us before. That guy was very dangerous for you. And for me. I was so fucking angry. I just followed him. But when I was there, I didn't really know what to do. And he was drinking like crazy. I was about to leave again. Don't you touch me either. We're standing here. Drop the attitude, man. As if it was meant to be. Suddenly, I was sure I had to do it. Asshole. It was over in no time. And the beauty of it all is that they can never catch us. If anybody's a suspect, it's those two guys. And why do you only tell me now? -Because you said you were a suspect. And if you knew, it would be dangerous for you. You kept going on about it... ...and I didn't know what to do anymore. All I could think of was to break up. I thought my heart broke... ...when I had to say that to you. You're my everything. You know that, don't you? Hey... hey, darling. I feel like pizza. Bear... -What? Oh, right, money plays no role anymore. -We're in La Palma now. Don't they have pizzas in La Palma? Yes, but they also have tapas and what's it called? Paella, gambas. Well, then I'll have... spaghetti. And since we have money now, we'll have very expensive red wine. Señor. Una gambas al ajillo... ...una spaghetti et una vino tinto grand reserva, por favor. Gracias. You do that well. I almost can't believe everything might turn out alright. It'll all be ok. The problems are over. Nobody can take anything away from us. I promise. Hey... Sluttie of mine. How does it feel to be rich? Not very special yet. From now on, it's going to be great. Mark my words. Oh... darling. Unbelievable. I can't believe it. Is this all yours? Or am I dreaming big time? No, it's ours. -No, it's yours, love. Yours. No, seriously. It's ours. Do you mean that? -Yes, of course. Yours and mine. If you really feel that way, will you marry me? Si, quiero. Si, quiero. Nice view, here. I was in Ibiza once when I was young. It looked a bit like this. Lucky you. I never left the country before the age of 15. Our kind of people didn't do that, my mother used to say. What would you do in summer? -We had no money to go on holiday. So they sent me to the cheapest holiday camp, in Egmond. There are some pretty good camping sites in Egmond. What? -Jesus, man. These were ragged barracks with barbed wire around them. But then it became a place for sick children. Oh, great. And then what? Then I was old enough to take the bus to the beach. I got 1.50 and had to make that last the whole day. It was just enough for fries and an ice-cream. Times have changed, baby. Chantal, show me where the toilet is? -Yes. That way. Hey... that situation with the police... -Yes, what about it? Has that been solved? Chantal? Is that important right now? -That son? What about him? -Yes, he's dead. Murdered? Yes. By who? Did they find someone? Damn it. Can you be happy for me, please? It's my wedding day. What is it? -Why did he want to get married? Just like that. -Well, for instance... ...if something happens to me, then... -He's got someone else. The toilet's there. And his balls have been taken off. Oh, that must have hurt. Hey, sluttie of mine. Hello, cut it out. There are adults present. There are? Where? Speech. To the nicest and richest friends I have. Yo, Rudi... Sluttie... -Hey. Look what I found. Wow... Tip doesn't lead to anything. Ordinary pub brawl with fatal consequences. That's how easy it is. That easy. POISON Hey, what are you doing in the middle of the night? Hey? -I couldn't sleep. What's wrong? I was sitting here and... I was thinking of Jacobsen and his son. What about them? Don't you care that they're dead because of us? Exterminating rats is my job, darling. After you've done one... Come, let's go to bed. I'll give you a massage so you can sleep. Barely 20. I'm almost 30. But he loves me. He really loves me. That's why he sticks it in 20 year olds. -Damn it. When are you going to wake up? Haven't you had enough misery? I can't live without Robin. -Oh, cut it out. He'd hardly shown up again and you ran to the altar. If something happens to you, then he... He's done it before, hasn't he? Twice. -Don't say it. It's not true. You're wrong. -I didn't want to tell you. At the fair. I'm coming. He never mentions money. Hi. -Hey, how are you? Yes. Were you able to help her a bit? Well, she had quite a problem. Yes. Since we're talking about it... ...that Gold card you ordered for me, for the bigger amounts... ...it still hasn't arrived. Can you call them? Uhm... yes. Yes, alright. -Yes? Do it tomorrow, ok? -Yes, I will. What on earth is wrong then? -I want to show you something. Where? -It's in Egmond... you know? When you enter the town, there's a sign that says "Vista Dune". There. We have a house in La Palma and you ask me to come to Egmond? It's a surprise. Ok, if you say so. How about that Gold card? It should be there today, they said. But uhm... five o'clock? I booked a flight for you at 9:30 am. You'll make that easily. How are you, Mrs Jacobsen? -Lovers. Excuse me. What can I do for you? I'd like to arrange something. As fast as possible. Yes. -It's me. Where are you? I'm shopping a bit. What's wrong? -I have to tell you something. Oh, again? -Yes, because... I don't need it. If you wanted to rub it in one more time... ...I can do without that. -Listen for a moment. I've made up my mind and I'm going to do something about it. Once and for all. Remember the place where I... No, never mind. Chantal, what are you doing? Damn it. -See you. I'll be damned. Are you back in the country? Did you find someone for me? -Why? Did you want to come back? I have an appointment this afternoon, but we can have a look now. At what? This is a sprinter. But it's up to you. Let me get some money. You're a good guy. Really. -I need a cab. I have to go to Egmond. What are you doing there? -Beats me. Chantal wanted to show me something and I had to come right away. Oh... let me drop you off. Ok, thanks man. -Are you thanking me? Thank you! How will you get back to town? I'll just wait here for a bit. Call me if you need me. -Yes, alright. Hey. -Hey... Damn. Any other good ideas? Hey, sluttie. Can't we meet in a restaurant next time? Anyway, I'm curious. I wanted to say something first. -Go ahead. Remember when we had just met? Yes. What about it? Why did you like me? -What kind of question is that? No, tell me. Well, you looked hot. Did you mind when I was with Jacobsen? -No. Is that what you want to hear? What did you miss the most about me? -Your little cunt? Your little ass? Did you look at other women? You look with your eyes, not with your hands. My mother always said that. But were you ever tempted? What is this? An interrogation? You can be honest with me. I understand. I used to have a picture of my right hand on the mantelpiece. No, sluttie of mine. No, really. You're the only one for me. What are you doing here? -Where are they? Who? -Who do you think? Up there somewhere. Why? What are we doing here? What was your plan? Did you want to exterminate me like a cockroach? Like a mouse? Sorry? -Were you going to drown me in the pool? Or just beat me to death? Or strangle me? What's wrong with you? Why don't you love me anymore? What did I do? Am I not beautiful anymore? Too old? Do you like them ten years younger? What are you on about? I still loved you. During the whole fucking nightmare, while those two were humiliating me. God knows how much I loved you. And still. Ruud just brought me some things. You said you had a cockroach problem. Why don't you believe me? Ever since those 6 million are hanging over our heads, you've been lying to me. Only that one fucking time, to protect you. You've got someone else. No. Yes. Damn it, only once. You were gone for 8 months. I'm only human. Only once? -Yes! And at the fair? Or once more after that? And is she waiting at home now until you've wrapped things up? Fuck, damn it. You misunderstand. I love you. -I don't want to be screwed anymore. Hey! -I don't want it anymore. Hey, what are you doing? Hurry! Chantal, no... Don't do it. No. Take it. Take it. Look at that. There. Yes, what's with those children? -They have cancer. They're dying. They get a little bit of a holiday there. And that silly fucking camp where I spent time myself... ...received six million euros today. There was a little house for sale behind the hair salon. A bit run-down, but a coat of paint works miracles. I could just afford it. And then it was all gone. Even the credit card bills couldn't be paid anymore. I read the other day that you can't start over in life. I don't know if that's true. Maybe I'll call him one day... ...so we can meet. Maybe.
