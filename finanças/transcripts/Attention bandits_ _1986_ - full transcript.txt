BANDIT: outlaw criminal. See: gangster, burglar, thief, swindler, shark, crook, cutthroat, scoundrel, rogue. Start from the right... It's in the wrist, not the body. Right to left, if you go the other way... you're in trouble. Like your mother over there. You'll snag her line... or put out her eye. You don't listen. This is more important than school. There you can coast. Diplomas can be faked, but not fishing. Simon! Yell... scare the trout away. A kid wants to see you. Says he's Frontin's son. Frontin has a son? What do I say? My real doesn't work. Well? I'm coming. You're way over by the crayfish; Get a net. They always bug me when I'm fishing. Frontin's son? No, but it was the only way... to see me. I hope it's worth my while. Why Frontin? For guys my age, he's... And he's your friend. - How old are you? - Eighteen. You've got nerve coming here. Lucky I'm in a good mood. What's the deal? Cartier... you're aiming for the big time. Robbery's more in Frontin's line. It's to handle the merchandise. I need an expert. The big city. My daughter does the urban planning. She makes dates at the Papa-Mama intersection... Your Cartier date... I'm not high on it. Marie Sophie Road, she's our urban planner. Here she is in person. A catastrophe? Uncle Charles got two fish. Always when I'm not there. What did he do, outrun them? He fell in and hit them? I'm not much help with homework, but... with fishhooks... You like fishing? Very much. A man who'll get ahead. Chariot caught two? Two big ones. Where is he? Gone to buy the papers. It made headlines already? I'm hopeless. You'll catch on. My wife Frangoise... what's your name? Julien Bastide, alias Mozart. Why Mozart? Tell you later. You see? If it were up to me, they'd die of old age. Seems he's an ace. A little contest? Sure. The forest just outside Rouen. Right. An abandoned wine press. We'll signal with flashlights. How long to get here? About an hour. Don't start till everyone's seated. I bet Papa's not eating. My husband's brother is here, can we have the night off? As long as my husband agrees. You heard me. How old was Gabin? Seventy-two. JEAN GABIN DEAD You heard her. Fruit before meals is good for you. California-style: fruit for life. When'll you be back? Two days. And Charles? Tomorrow morning. He'll bring croissants. When parents drink, their kids... - Drink. - Go down the hatch! Jean Gabin's death overshadows all other news. First: no word of the hostage held by the three gangsters who robbed Cartier's taking valuables estimated at 30 million francs. They wore hoods, but had young voices. Back to Jean Gabin. Tonight we honor him with reminiscences by his friends and fellow-actors. Now his famous song: "I Know... I Know". Without Gabin, gangster films are sunk. When did these kids contact you? I only met one Calls himself Mozart. The accordionist? Mozart because he pulled his first job at age five. It was spring, I was green When I turned eighteen I said: I know Now I really know - You found us? - As You see. This is Mozart; recognize him? This is Lucky... Our mascot La Glue. Boubou... Mr. Verini. Mozart, Lucky, La Glue, Boubou. Inspires confidence. Where's the stuff? Well? 10 million maximum. If the market's right. The radio said 30 million. So go on the air. The insurance policy? Change "y" to "e", you got police. The radio also said three gangsters. He played hostage. I dressed for the part. Ten... okay? Three days from now, noon sharp. No sooner? Want us to come with you? In case you get lost. Go to Amsterdam for me? No, he can't add. This may sound stupid, but... touch his head, it'll bring you luck. Don't show us out, we know the way. What's 10 million divided by 4? By 6... we're on overtime. A millionaire before he's twenty. Smart kid, that Mozart. If he were smart, he'd change trades. Are we such dopes? You tell me. See you tomorrow. Don't call unless there's a hitch. Jean Claude! What happened? At 3 AM a guy tied us up and kidnapped Mrs. Verini. He wore a hood, but he had a young voice. Marie Sophie? She's fine, she's in her room. If he loves his wife more than jewels, we're in business. If Mr. Verini loves his wife... You open up to just anybody I thought it was you, he blew his horn like you. I thought you'd come back early. You saw his car? A Citroen DS, just like yours. It's bad... very bad. Don't forget the ice, we'll need it. Your grandmother is sick. Papa and Mama went to see her. Is it serious? No, but at her age she needs care. Stay at Manouchka's till I call. Bye, sweetheart. When Grandma's better, we'll come get you. - You recognized me? - From the first. Let me go and I won't tell my husband. All right? Marie Sophie? Safe with Manouchka. Jean Claude has the DS, I have the Jeep. Any ideas? One of the 4 who hates to divide by 6. The jewels? Let me talk to my wife. Hurry! You heard? Now for the rendezvous. The Gonneville station... The big stairway Stop! The suitcase! Open it. Close it. Back up. More! Don't move. Passports, please. Anything to declare? No, I'm taking my daughter to a Swiss school. Open your trunk. You're sure Mama agrees? It was her idea, I told you. The best teachers; It's world-famous. Daughters of kings and princes go there. I'm sick. Why say that? That's why I'm going to Switzerland. Everyone in Switzerland is sick. We'll make you a princess in a school for princesses. Then it's Mama who's sick. Grandma's sick and your mother is with her. How often must I say it? We can go. If Mama were dead, you'd tell me? Count Verini, I have no openings for two years. I can't wait two hours. Look at my waiting-list. I'll tell you the truth. I am Verini, but I'm not a count. And my activities aren't strictly legal. Meaning what? I want my daughter in a safe place. Our girls have impeccable references. My references. I don't understand. Ten years' fees plus a token of my appreciation. You're crazy. About my daughter. Keep her till she's 21... and a princess. Marie Sophie, the headmistress... My assistant... How old are you? Nearly 12. And nuts about horses. Riding, tennis, skiing, sailing: You'll have it all. Do you study hard? Good grades? From the Prince DE Montesquieu; We raised his children. Very nice. But a fake. You aren't serious. Absolutely. Oh yes, it's nice but it's a fake. I'll find you a buyer. Here they are. Right on time. Everything okay? Trouble? That's 10 million? Minus our cut. They're for real? Are you? Now that I'm rich... The money came from Geneva, not Amsterdam. Thanks, anyway. It's my money. Explain that. I intend to. One of you scumbags killed my wife took the jewels... and is about to dip into my savings. From this minute on... he won't sleep easy, eat easy... or even fuck easy. Because he knows he can't outrun a bullet. And him? And you! You came to my house, saw my servants... met my wife... knew the helicopter schedule. You disappoint me. I'll disappoint you even more. I'm going to play cop. I have no choice. What did you all do... after we left the other night? As we planned, we... anyway, I went back to Paris. Me too. We hung around here. Together. I know what alibis are worth, but can you prove it? It's because you didn't touch La Glue's head. Yes, why didn't you? Pray to God I don't touch your head. What do we do with the money? Keep it or give it back? Keep it. Help me, you jerk. One of us is a traitor? Who'd pull such a dumb stunt? Not him or him... Not you or me. If it's anyone, it's you. Gentlemen... May we come in? You need the whole force? What's this? Very pretty piece. And? Cartier's. I know you're a top cop, but even so. Isn't it a bit obvious? Where's the rest of the haul? How come I get two doors? Maybe you're double trouble. Can I have some colored pencils? Rio DE Janeiro: November 19, 1976. Sweetheart, I'm sorry. Mama and I had to go to Brazil on business. So I won't see you this Sunday and maybe not next. Brazil is far away and very hot. An emergency came up: That's the breaks. We move around a lot, so write us at home. Mail's being forwarded As for Grandma, she's much better. Now Mama will draw you a picture... of what we see from our window. Good news? No... they can't come this week. It's no place for a little girl. This is virgin forest, know what that is? Hey, 8 pygmy just ran by us There are mesquites, snakes, crocodiles, man-eating ants... No little girl could hold out. Papa sent it from Brazil, it brings good luck. I have my feet in a basin of cold water. It's a super way to stay awake. My teacher says there are no pygmies in Brazil. It's in the dictionary. So why did you tell me that? Now: top-secret for Mama. Papa is forbidden to read it... that's an order. Tomorrow we have piano; We play Mozart... like Papa's friend. With the knife, not the hands. With elegance, ladies. But best of all is horseback riding... at a riding school near here. That's where I met Antoine, the owner's son. He's my age and we like the same things. You tell nice stories, so I'll tell you one. Not as nice, but true. Once there was a sort of... urban Robin Hood who robbed the rich. One day a few months ago... this robber was arrested. Now he's locked up in Fresnes Prison. No fun when you have a daughter... you haven't seen since November. You guessed it. Robin Hood is me. I said I was at the end of the world. The end of the world is where you are. In a way, we're both boarders. So I won't see you at Christmas. Your mama's still in Brazil, so as not to be... mixed up in this mess. You aren't at recess? I have to write a letter. Why doesn't Mama write? With your grandmother so ill, she's kept very busy. I knew it was a lie about Brazil and pygmies. I don't care, I'm proud to be Robin Hood's daughter. I know you'll escape, like all great bandits. You will, won't you? Now that I know, I don't like going with the others. I'd rather be by myself. So tell me what it's like in prison. A man can go nuts with nobody to talk to. A spider in your cell is a big event. You watch it, talk to it, give it a name. Something alive is with you. Like your seagulls. That's it, now you've got it. Double somersault... Take a bow, you're a big hit. Time to go home. You know the best thing about knitting? All the things you think about as you do it. So many great ladies... made great decisions while knitting. Like fishing? That's right. - What're you making? - A hat. - For whom? - Papa. Keep your head down. Should I still believe in God? I ask because Mama never writes. I was sure she'd come for Christmas. Marie Sophie, you have a visitor! Mama? I know it's Mama! Happy New Year and Merry Christmas. Why isn't Mama here? She sent this from Brazil. The Indians play these. That's not from Brazil. I'll go see her. No, she's in a different world. How are you? I'm buying a hotel. Do I still send her letters via Brazil? I'll tell you when to stop. Frangoise isn't really in Brazil. Not really, no. So that's it. That's why I waited till you were older... to tell you about your mother. Since they never found her or the jewels... I got ten years I adore your book; 113 pages with one phrases "I love you". I read every word: You wrote exactly... 22,892 I love you. See, I did read it. Confess, not all those "I love you" were for me. I bet half are for someone else. That someone else could be... the dashing Antoine. Am I wrong? A word of advice. You're not there to be sheltered, but to learn to fight. Beware of a first love. It hurts the most. "I want to be able to say without affectation, "that my two turning-points were when "Father sent me to Oxford and Society sent me to prison". This is a subject close to me. The author, Oscar Wilde spent two years in prison. I want you to write an essay. Imagine the last night of a man who's leaving prison after ten years. You have an hour. Sorry if I seem nervous: Tomorrow's a big day for me. After all, there's no honor among thieves. Maybe I sensed that and got you off just before my arrest. That school is now your home and your family. Promise me two things. Never leave there until I'm free. Never come see me, even if I'm here for years. A 10-minute visit... and hours of suffering. Wh... where you from? Ge... Ge... Montreux. Wh... what's all that? L... Love letters. Making fun of me? No, I have the same problem. Okay, put it away. We go via Paris? No, direct to Fresnes. Is it near the prison? It is the prison. Your boyfriend? Almost. If he doesn't comment on my hat, it means Papa's terrific. I give him 13 seconds. 1.. 2.. 3... 13! My father's a terrific guy! - That job For my daughter... - I'll ask Manouchka. 7200 francs. For 10 years of making flowers. You got room and board. See her? Can I come in? Hey, how about me? The trouble we had finding that silly thing. Where to? Manouchka's on Rue Balzac. Stop off at Cartier's: Avenue Montaigne. May I help you? I hope so... I have 7200 francs. What can I get for that? I'm serious. We have some lovely scarves... cigarette lighters... Pens... handbags... Can we see? Follow me, it's upstairs. Follow us, it's upstairs. It's definitely Verini. I spotted him on my monitor. And I can see him from here. He's with a woman, they're... pretending to buy a pen. Yes, but hurry. Martine? Now don't panic... We're having a holdup. Go to Frangoise, very calmly. I'll come reinforce you. Like it? May I help you? We're choosing a pen, the decision is imminent. See anything you like? This one. Gift-wrapped? No, I'll just... don't bother. The cashier's desk is downstairs? - How are You paying? - Cash. The pen costs... 2000 francs, sir. If you'll wait, we have to check all 500-franc bills. Go ahead. Two minutes... I vouch for them: Mint-issue from Fresnes Prison All genuine? I told you; No monkey business at Fresnes. The pen's genuine, not made in Hong Kong? Don't worry, sir. You should've seen: Fort Alamo! They came from all sides. They're still uptight. Always take up where you left off. COITIG see you L'FOOITIS. I'm not in to anyone. How do you like the decor? Not bad... except for the flowers. What's wrong with them? Everything Your mama and I were so close he almost married us both. The time I had getting you gifts from Brazil! Got a car I can use? Take mine. You going far? I'm taking her to Normandy. We decided the first thing we'd do together is go see Mama. Be back tonight; I've laid on a party. Just a fast trip. Who'll be there? Mozart and his gang. I figured you'd want that When I passed my test, I wished so hard you could see me. I was so proud! I'm proud too, but... it's obvious you learned in Switzerland. You think I?d.. drive badly? I think you stutter; You never wrote me that. You really do stutter? A little. You're disappointed. No, I just mean... Why didn't they correct it in... that school that does everything. It bothers you? They deliver young ladies factory-sealed... ready for use. Well, I stutter. I'm marrying a Swiss... I'm a lousy driver and I stutter. Your quarrels will be fun. Manouchka called, the dinner party's on. He's out? What's the trend? Down, like yesterday. We buy? Naturally. Terrorism can't go on forever. The German mark is flying high. What about lunch? Lucky will meet us next door. For me? Cartier's? Yes... What else? I didn't see you do it. I didn't see me either, it jumped at me. I'm daydreaming and "Take me, take me!" If you don't like it, I'll exchange it. It's not hard. So you're... disappointed in your Papa. The bandit who made his daughter a princess. The princess and the bandit. Sounds like a book. If it's in our blood... No, now please. There are no nice crooks. And you? I'm not a real crook and I'm not... really very nice. And I'm not a real princess. How do you feel? Hungry for a good meal. Hungry to... get my teeth into a lot of things. Ever killed anyone? For you mama, I'm ready to. What is it? That man. - He called You A whore. - I didn't hear him. I learned lip-reading in prison. I look like a whore? I look like a guy who'd be with one. I see his point: often when... an older guy gives a pretty girl a pretty watch... it means she's a pretty whore. Facts of life. What'd you do before? I was an insurance appraiser. I had a system. I'd go to someone's house to do an appraisal... I'd examine a painting and say... "I'm sorry, but this is a fake". Big panic, then I'd say... "We can't insure it, but I'll find you a buyer... "who's not too fussy". Guess who that was. Mama. Your mother wasn't... very fussy, and that way... What did she do before you met here? She made out. She was a fantastic woman. Great pals with Manou. Two fantastic women... who weren't too fussy. And I wasn't too fussy, either. The headmistress's painting, is it real or fake? No, that's a real fake. No harm in doing a favor. Maybe even the Louvre is full of fakes. Van Gogh did around 1000 paintings in his lifetime... and there must be 20,000 in the United States alone. Actually, you're very cultivated. What your mother and I cultivated was luxury. And luxury is a crook's downfall. What's a punk? A lazy bum with expensive tastes. What's Scoter e la duglere? It's a kind of... salmi of sea duck. No joke A brown sauce... with minced onions and... The tricky part is binding it with the liver. - Right? - 100 percent. And Rabbit au pere douillet? Very nouvelle cuisine. Cut a small rabbit in pieces... or leave it whole... and cook it with... lard, chives and onions. Still 100 percent. Home Economics? Yes, but I never cooked it... or tasted it. You cook and eat the way you drive. We'll take the pere douillet. Get both, so we can... Right... Give us one of each. What can't you do? You make me blush. They didn't teach that. Will we ever know who killed her? Me, with my fathead tricks. Apart from that, except for Mozart's boys... there's nobody. When I look at them tonight, I'll know. You can read people's eyes. Well, you can read lips. There's a man looking at us; What's he saying? He's talking about us. It's harder to do backwards. He says... "That girl looks just like her father" He didn't. Yes he did. That's the difference between... a gentleman and a jerk You think we look alike? Yes, don't you? PROTECTED BY GUARD DOGS AND ALARMS I want to see Mr. Valence. You're expected? Tell him it's Mr. Verini, I used to own this place. I'll see if he's in. Recognize it? Mama Street, Papa Street, Chariot Alley... The trout lake... I pictured it smaller. Over 7 acres. I hate to bother them. I spent 10 years not bothering anyone Where is she? We never kept people waiting. Sorry to interrupt your weekend, but... I wanted to show my daughter her childhood home. Come join us for coffee. No, we'll go down by the lake and the cliff. - Just walk around. - As You like. I'll save you some coffee. If you insist. Only you, me and Charles know. I'm glad we came. They didn't find the jewels. So that's it. Of course... That's why he came back. The "daughter" is an excuse. Do we go drink his coffee? I can't look at the house now. Shall I buy it back? Could you? Everything has a price I'd have to go back to work. We'd better call the police. It's me. Any luck? Very classy. How's the kid? She's great, one in a million. Grade A. Van der Broucke... best you could do? It was that or Japanese. You going yuppie? Marie Sophie chose it. - How much? - 15 thousand. Everything?s gone UP... Wish I could skip this party. Nothing else to wear? I didn't know there'd be a dinner. Paris is beautiful. What did you think of him? Can you fall in love in 12 hours? Even in 12 seconds. Living high, eh? We hit it lucky. The families? The old Yalta split. Yalta? Can we tell her? Girls in Lyon... drugs in Marseilles... gambling in Corsica. And modern bandits. May I dance with her? If she'll accept. Open the curtain. Did you kill my mother? Do you think so? If I ask... Did he give you that idea? Would I kill my future mother-in-law? You're very conceited. Here's Papa. - May I dance with her? - Why not? Well? I looked them over, it's not them. Even him? I'll drive you back tomorrow and meet Antoine. Except for his Swiss accent, you'll adore him. The surprise is here. What surprise? A surprise. Are you serious? Ve W... I'll bring him back. Can I take over from Papa? Dancing, that is. I don't mind. Nice cake. Is that the surprise? Michele? What's going on? Your husband? That's why I want to see you. Here in the kitchen. Mozart said to tell you everything. I'm listening. My husband and his brother set it up. Your wife recognized his brother, so... And you knew? I loved him. Then he fell for this girl. Where is he now? He and his brother bought an inn in Chagny. Beat it before I strangle you. Forgive me. How long have you known? 6 months... Since her husband split. Thanks. Shall we serve the cake? Some other time. Shouldn't you sleep? I slept for 10 years. Do you have to go? Can't we just drop the whole thing? I told you not to come. I wanted to stay with you. Come on... let's forget it. Want a coffee? Remember fishing with me? Vaguely, but... You were just a kid. Do you still fish? When I can. Relax, they'll be back. Why'd you come with us? Why'd he come with us? For my big eyes. Anyone here? Got any rooms? Now? I'll see if anything?s free. Your boss's room number. Did you hear me? 31. - His brother? - 30. The passkey. Where are the rooms? Through that door. Sit down. Call his brother. Say he's sick; it's urgent. Your brother's sick, can you come? What's the matter? Wait... We have lots of money left. You can have it all. I'll dress and go get it. No, please... Don't kill me. I won't tell anyone. Please... Let's go. I hope you can keep your mouth shut. Hello, police? Route 102 to Geneva, we'll be there for lunch. Who are you to kill people like that? I'm a witness, too. You have no idea what you did, it's crazy! You don't even know! You can't say that; They shot first. I waited ten years... ten years to see that! I waited too! They killed your mother! They had it coming! I'm taking you back and you can... I don't want you to take me, I'll go by myself! What kind of man are you? Why did they let you out; You're dangerous! I wish I'd never seen you again! Let's cool it, we're at the border. Antoine... Papa. How old is he? He's 10 years old. 10 years: it's haunting us. Is that old? It's a good age. What I know about horses... So you can ride. Show us. Careful, it's slippery. Easy: the ground's frozen. Let's go. Come to Mozart's club. A real bed... I waited 10 years for that. - And A real woman. - A real bed, I said. Marie Sophie might call. Get him home early. Do you have to see the club? I'm beat! I been waiting 10 years. I been driving 10 hours. - Think she'll call? - Sure. What's up? We found your missing wife. Meaning what? Why didn't you bury her in a cemetery? It wasn't me. Can I search you? One left... Where are the other five? Where were you today, Mr. Van der Broucke? I took my daughter to Geneva; She's in veterinary school. Verini can go to Switzerland... not Van der Broucke. Got a warrant? Got a permit? You didn't happen to be in Chagny about 6 AM? What little I saw of him, I liked. Same with him. How's Chariot? He's fine. He met me at the airport and I barely recognized him. We've a lunch date. Tell him to watch it; They suspect he was in Chagny, too. You look tired. A papa like you isn't very restful. I saw your lawyer. At my age, 20 years or life is all the same. You'll get out even if I have to learn to fly. Learn to forget me. And the guys with me. Starting with Mozart. I'll be here every week. Take Swiss citizenship and marry him fast. No wedding without you. It'd have to be here. Can we? One of you has to be a resident. Why'd you keep the gun? Beginner's mistake. I'll be back. Don't bother. It hurts too much. I'll be back every week. Next time I'll bring Antoine, he's competing in the horse show. You don't mind if he comes? Yes... No. There he is; he's not alone. He's hooked. Going to tell your fianc? you were with me? I'll say we talked escape. You honor us with your presence. You like our little palace? How's your father? He could be better. Give him this hair, he'll understand. Charming. I think we're unwanted. It'd take an army to get him out. So raise one. It's the big house: sewed up tight. They call it that? Not any more, but it's the same thing. Maximum security: nobody escapes. I'll do anything. You'll be back? Next week: the horse show. I never said this to anyone... I've heard it. I love my fianc? very much. Nothing will stop me from marrying him. Why does your papa hate me? He once said that... there are no exceptions among crooks. Himself included? Himself most of all. No exceptions... I'll end up in jail or the morgue. We have to get Papa out. Where's Chariot, he's taking me home. I'll take you. No, Chariot will be here. Don't forget the hair. I hope the cops are blind; I knew you right off. Very funny... So long, ladies. If I get your father out, will you marry me? Of course. You think he can really get him out? He hasn't missed so far. When do you see Papa? Next week. Tell him I'm fine, but bored stiff. How's the horse show? We haven't been; we'll go later. He does have an accent. I'm teasing; I like your country. It's paradise, if discipline's your thing. When do you compete? Tonight. Got a chance? If I go fast, with no mistakes. Staying at Manouchka's? Of course... She's waiting for you, too. Jogging time You found it? I was 13 when I made that. Never wears out. Good luck tonight. The Horse Show: Porte DE Versailles. A fantastic saddle, I bet it's really comfortable. If I win, it's yours. You think it's hopeless? No, but I'd rather you offer it to me if you lose. That way we salvage something. Are you before Durandot? After. I wish Papa could see you ride. On the bed? It's original... It's superb. My first saddle. It's fabulous! I didn't see you buy it. It wasn't me. I love it when you're like this. Is the horse coming next? It wasn't me. It's beautiful, I can't tell you! I love you. May I? The gala at the Opera will jam up traffic, so don't dawdle. Come in, come in... Look what Antoine gave me. It's Mexican. It wasn't me. You're adorable. I love you! Whenever some VIP comes to town, it's murder. How long to get to the Porte DE Versailles? First we have to get through this. You go on when? I'm 39, just after 38. When does number 39 go on? About half an hour. SOVIET PREMIER AT OPERA TONIGHT The phone number of the Opera, please. Yes, Opera... Like the metro stop. The opera house? Give me your security chief, it's urgent. Urgent, I said. I'll be brief: The whole ceiling is mined. With my remote control, I can blow the place up. I also planted a micro camera so I can survey the Presidential box. If he leaves his box or the performance stops, you go sky high. By the end of the show, I want Fresnes Prison to release Simon Verini, cell 2017. Verini free or a massacre at the Opera. This isn't political, you can say he escaped. The President is to stay put... and the show is to go on! A PHONE CALL CAN SAVE A LIFE You guarantee not to leak the truth. The "escape" will have no link to this gala. I said so, didn't I? I'll call in half an hour. If Verini's out, I'll tell you how to defuse the bombs. Get a move on! What's going on? Get dressed and fast. You refuse to tell me. You're escaping, didn't you know? You have 15 minutes to get out. I get dressed... I leave and you shoot me down. Don't complicate things. I'm not, you are. You leave or there's 2000 dead at the Opera. 2000 dead. You're stir crazy. Nothing better to do on a boring night? You'll go with me to a taxi. You're releasing me. You're escaping... there's a difference. Lend me 100 francs for the taxi? Where to? Beats me... Roll for 100 francs. When do I signal his escape? Hotel Balzac, please. I began well. I thought you had it. THE GOVERNMENT WARNS TERRORISTS: WE WILL NOT GIVE IN TO BLACKMAIL What's going on? My cook heard on the radio that your father escaped. That's crazy. We'll listen to the news in my room. How much is left? 13 francs. Drop me at a metro stop. Verini knocked out a guard, took his uniform and keys... and escaped from the cell block. He held a gun on two more guards... which got him through the last gate. The owner of the Hotel Balzac? Speaking. Inspector Dupuis here; I'd like to see you. Certainly, Inspector. Where? You'll have to come to Rome. Rome... in Italy. Is it urgent? As fast as you can. I'll take the first plane. Is it the Rome metro stop or Place d'Italie? He said Rome first, I'll try it. - Can I come? - No way! Stay here; The cops will be along any minute. You had a million calls, where were you? Where were you? If I said at the opera, would you believe me? Don't go, we have to talk. You do bring luck. - Good night? - Jam-packed. Come to my wedding? It's set? The Swiss girl? Not a word to anyone. What did he say? It's a secret... He's getting married. Miss Verini, please. You can't marry all three of us. If I'm the lucky winner... Instead of the organ playing Mendelssohn, how about a little Mozart? Are you there? I got a horse for the saddle. Who was it? What's wrong? I did something stupid. Give me Miss Verini again. Listen, pass me Manou. She's in Rome, in Italy. Rome... as in Italy. By the W3? I give back your promise. No idea, maybe they want to kill me later on. Or I look like someone who needs a double. All this terrorism and bombing... maybe they need my cell, what do I know? I don't get it, but... just the same, if I escaped, I escaped. Now I need a hideout. Where did he come from? Tonight nothing surprises me. Hello lovebirds, do I disturb? Don't talk nonsense. What're you doing here? I didn't dream he'd do it. A promise to a hoodlum has no validity. Now we know who sent the saddle. You owe no thanks to a hoodlum. You're a great guy... when things go right. And he's great when they don't. How long did you plan it? If I'd planned it, I wouldn't have done it. I can't believe they didn't check. Usually in a bomb alert, they stop the show... and get people out I didn't let them. You're quite a bastard. You insult your future son-in-law. You putting me on? You don't think I did it for you? You been laying her? No, I swear... Not yet. Let's not argue over some punk. Stop it, Antoine. It's all set. Can I see him? First we'll pick up Chariot. It's cold out. I don't care, I'm fine. I'd rather you didn't come. Don't want me along? No! You've met? No, but I've heard about you. Simon Verini: Gaston. He needs a hideout and safe passage. Manouchka already called. Tomorrow I've got a barge going to Germany. Coffee? So did she take back her promise? No idea, I hung up. Reminds me of Fresnes. You don't seem happy. When you travel at my age, you'd rather go first class. What will you do about Marie Sophie? I'll be gone when she comes. Funny, you're always mad at me. Would I be in this mess if you hadn't showed up... 10 years ago when I was fishing? Speaking of fishing, there's everything you need here. He did it alone? With 3 phone calls and a 3-franc investment. I always said he was smart. Smart? I think it's sick! It's shameful, immoral. Now he's a terrorist, too. But your father's free. I bet he's not proud of it. Not the big sermon again. I'm sorry but it stinks... it's really low. Remember you gave your word. He gave it back. He's even straighter than I thought. Love like that doesn't grow on trees. That's what worries me. Is it far? I don't believe my eyes! Coffee? What a crazy story. With all the goings-on these days... nothing crazy about it. I'm fast asleep and they wake me up to throw me out. Instead of drowning it, take it off. - Better? - More practical. Will you be here long? In a few hours we go to Germany. Can I go? With every cop in France on my tail? I'll tell you when it's okay. Mozart's not here? No, Mozart's not here. Mozart's fishing. He's an expert, remember? We could test it out. Test it out? Want to fish? Want me to kiss you? Want me to stop fishing? Make a choice or I'll kiss you. Does Papa agree? Preliminary test. Secondary test. Not quite the final test, but not bad.
