They used a whip of wolf's rawhide to inflict pain on each other's flesh... the only way they could be sure of one another's love. 1966. Sari's parents have inherited the genes for this abominable propensity. That dark, fateful passion has cast its shadow over Sari's thin, watery blood. SPRING When spring came, the girls entered a world out of a fairy tale. There was a very strange park there where adults basked in the sun with quiet smiles on their faces. The girls spent an entire day there. As they said farewell to that day, the girls began to lose the wonderful ability to believe in things that don't exist in this world. ONE FINE AFTERNOON ON A HILL That's the young man Sari loved. But the young man seemed to be more attracted to Emi. RAIN SUMMER WHERE DID EMI COME FROM? FROM THE SEA THE BRIGHT, DAZZLING SEA Sari had a dream. In her dream, the young man she loved took on the form of her father and the man from the legend. He was kind enough to love Sari's blood. THE END OF SUMMER I KNOW THE SEA TOO BUT MINE IS A DARK, DARK SEA The dark passions of Sari's mother sprouted impure blossoms in front of Emi's pure, naked flesh. Thus, this fateful couple's lives became entangled with that of a young girl. The fires of destiny were blazing. "Love is a gentle wildflower... a flower that won't wilt in the heat of the summer sun. A fevered passion hidden in one's breast... never to be frosted over by doubt. " O, my one and only love! Sinking... my darling. Sinking... my darling. Sinking into the city streets. The roar of the dark sea... so far away, yet I can still hear it. The sound of the sea's dark waves sinking into the city streets. "Striking the drum, playing the flute, on Sundays the innocent child plays on the tatami mat. " - Chuya Nakahara " You've taken my heart captive... and I have taken yours. We have exchanged heart for heart... happiness for happiness. I have returned your heart. Now I possess nobody's heart. I have returned your heart... yet I have lost... my own. " - Marceline Desbordes-Valmore I really feel my age. Tell me, where are you going? I'm going on a trip. I flow along with the wind... a bird of passage at the end of the road. I tear up at the setting sun. Who can know my weeping heart? Last night's dream still saddens me today. I'm like a lonely, wandering meteor in the sky. The scattered blossoms of my heart flutter down to the green pond. When will I return to my distant home? I'm a wanderer, a vagabond without a home. Glimmering in the blue glass... little sister of my vanished heart. LET'S HAVE A SHOOT-OUT! Brother! Two people who can never love each other... why is a heart that has loved so pitiful? O brother! O sister! O beautiful dream! Summoned by God, to heaven we go! Blossoms fall, drenched in tears, and wind blows beyond the rainbow. Ah, spring, spring! The romance of youth! Shoot him! Shoot the little boy in my heart! You couldn't do it. You wouldn't do it. You just left by yourself. I broke the law. I don't need a gun. It's a waste of breath to say farewell. Just say "so long." El Dorado! FAR AWAY NOW THE STORY DESCENDS INTO A RUINOUS ABYSS WITH VIOLENT MUSIC EEK! An era passes, and a new one begins. A new era is always encroached upon by the legends of eras past. TOO LATE! The dandelions aren't blooming today. A MYTHICAL AFTERNOON "People cannot... remain in dreams forever. " - Roger Vadim MORNING COMES TO THE SEA The days passed, heartbreaking yet brilliant. It was that time of year. This is the story of the film I wanted to make and my young friends who gathered to make it. What's more, it's a memento of their youth. One day I saw Dracula. Someday I'll make a Dracula movie. Well, it's already autumn. What shall I do? "Simone! The leaves have fallen. Let's go to the forest. " How desolate, the fallen leaves at night. Blown to and fro by the wind, the leaves gently call out. "Simone, do you like the sound of footsteps on the fallen leaves? Come. One day, we too will be poor fallen leaves. Come. Night is falling. The wind pierces our bones. Simone, do you like the sound of footsteps on the fallen leaves?" FAREWELL - Remy de Gourmont DRACULA YOUTH QUOTATIONS ABOUT DRACULA FROM A REPORT BY EIJI YAMANA
