- That's them. - Yeah. Molly's the big one. The little one's her sister, Daisy. The middle one's their cousin, Gracie. - What about the fathers? - Moved on. - I catch 'em goanna. - Molly got goanna! Bring it here. The next batch. Nothing out of the ordinary. There's two applications for Section 63 exemptions. The police reports are there. William Harris is applying for permission to marry. She's half-caste also. And Mary Wilson is applying for permission to visit her child at Moore River. She's quite agitated. Oh, and Gladys Phillips has written for permission to buy some new shoes. She had a new pair a year ago. Now, this report from Constable Riggs about the three little half-caste girls at the Jigalong Fence Depot- Molly, Gracie and Daisy. The youngest is of particular concern. She's promised to a full-blood. I'm authorising their removal. They're to be taken to Moore River as soon as possible. Oh, and, Miss Thomas - if you could check that the rate for police transportation is still, I believe, eight pence per mile. - Yes, Mr Neville. - Thank you. That country over there, that's woman country. You can't go there. You get big trouble. Yeah, I know. - Where your country? - My country? Down south. Long way from here. Our dad works there on the rabbit fence. Yeah? How far does rabbit fence go to? The rabbit-proof fence? It goes all the way to the sea down that way. Right to the top of Australia. Longest fence in the world. And all the way to the sea down that way. 1,500 miles long. Keeps the rabbits on that side of the fence, keeps the farmland on this side of the fence. That Molly's getting to be a big girl. Mr Neville's been writing to me about those girls, you know. Frankie. Come on, it's your turn. Come and get your rations. Hurry up. - Run! - Gracie! You go, Molly! I've come for the three girls, Maude. No! No, these my kids! Mine! It's the law, Maude. - You've got no say in it. - No! Mine! Mr Neville's orders. Now, listen. Move one inch and I will lock your mother up! He's their legal guardian. Right? Get away from us! No! No! No! Gracie! Give me back my kids! You sit up and you stay! - I got the papers, Maude. - Don't take them! You got no say in it! Get in the car! Now, the three of youse, don't move. There's nothing you can do here, old girl. - Nothing you can do. - Leave them! Leave them! As you know, every Aborigine born in this state comes under my control. Notice, if you will, the half-caste child- and there are ever-increasing numbers of them, Now, what is to happen to them? Are we to allow the creation of an unwanted third race? Should the coloureds be encouraged to go back to the black or should they be advanced to white status and be absorbed in the white population? Now, time and again I'm asked by some white man, "If I marry this coloured person, "will our children be black?“ And as Chief Protector of Aborigines it is my responsibility to accept or reject those marriages. Here...is the answer. Three generations. Half-blood grandmother, quadroon daughter, octoroon grandson. Now, as you can see, in the third generation, or third cross, no trace of native origin is apparent. The continuing infiltration of white blood finally stamps out the black colour. The Aboriginal has simply been... ...bred out. Now... ...we come to... We come to the Moore River Native Settlement. Ladies, most of you are familiar with our work here, the training of domestic servants and farm labourers. I would like to thank you for your continuing support. Hundreds of half-caste children have been gathered up and brought here to be given the benefit of everything our culture has to offer. For if we are to fit and train such children for the future they cannot be left as they are, and, in spite of himself, the native must be helped. Hello there. A ghost! You poor dears.

Duty, service, responsibility- those are our watchwords. - Molly, keep still. - It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. No. Over here. Sweep it over here. To the door. Come on, this way. Push it towards me. Hey, Hacker's come back. Hey, tracker girl. Your dad's bringing Olive back. He catched her. Thank you, Moodoo. Stand there, young lady. Did you really think you'd get away with it? Now, stop that crying. You see what Miss Doyle has here? Olive, look at me. You see this here? The scissors? Did she run away home? She ran away to see her boyfriend. You should have thought about this beforehand. Come on. We'll see if those boys at New Norcia find you so attractive now, eh? In you 9°- She broke out through here. Usual story. Off to see her boyfriend at New Norcia. - The tracker brought her back. - Ah, yes, Moodoo. Mr Neal tells me that your probation period is up and that you wish to return to the Kimberleys - is that right? Of course, your daughter is here, isn't she? There would be no question of her going. She would have to stay here and continue her training. I think for the time being it would be best for all concerned if you were to remain here, Moodoo. I'd be prepared to consider your case in a year or so, but... ...until then... Now, about those little ones from Kalgoorlie. Those babies. Where are their mothers? They got no mothers. Nobody here got any mothers. I got mother. Come on, they're lining up. Let's go. Bad place. Make me sick. These people... Sick. Make me sick. Come on, make your beds. Nice and tidy. If you've already done it, get to the church now. Hurry up. Stop dawdling. Molly, take the bucket out, then the three of you go to the church. Come on, you kids, get up there! You're late. Hurry up! Get up here, now! Come on. Get your things. We're going. Where are we going? We're going home. To Mother. How we gonna get there? Walk. We're not going, are we, Daisy? We like it here. That tracker, he's gonna get us and put us... He's not gonna get us and put us in the boob. We just keep walking. The rain will cover our tracks. We've gotta go now. Come on. Quick. Come on. Come on, Gracie. Now. - Too far, Molly. - Hurry up! ♪ He made their tiny wings ♪ All things bright and beautiful ♪ All creatures great and small... I Come on. Let's go! -Irene Clark. - Here. - Ellie Moodoo. - Here. Molly Craig. Molly Craig. Molly Craig. Gracie Fields. Daisy Kadibil. Nina, have you seen the new girls? Haven't seen them all day, Miss. Mister! Mr Neville said you'd better come real quick. That's two days ago, Mr Neal. Yes, I understand, but I require to be kept fully informed. Thank you. Goodbye. Those three girls. They've run off. Oh, dear. It'll be the older one. I wondered when I saw her. Too much of their mind... ...unfathomable. The trackefs onto it. In the meantime, it must be kept out of the papers. No rain. Tracker gonna get us. Tracker's not gonna gel us! Come on. We've gotta keep going. Come on, Gracie. Daisy, give me your bag. Give us your bag, quick. Give us it! Hurry up. In the water, in the water! We need to go fast. Shh. Shh. Shh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I see... ...big emu. Nah, nothing there. I see...big kangaroo. Red one. No. I don't see nothing. There's no food here. - I see... - We don't know this place. - How we gonna eat? - Shh! Run! Quick, hide. Come on. Ask them, Molly. Ask them for something to eat. You're from that Moore River place, eh? We're going home. Where your country? - Jigalong. - Jigalong? Proper long way. You know what you're doing? That tracker from Moore River. He Pretty good-. I heard he get them runaways all the time. Gotta be good to beat him. He take you back to that place. Here. You watch out for him, eh? You think you're so smart. Where are we? We're lost. Jigalong that way. North. Tracker followed them to...this riverbank, but lost their tracks in the water about a week ago. There's been no sign of them since. Three little half-castes. We're talking quite a few man-hours here. Who's going to pay for it? There's very little money in my departmental budget. I'm hoping that if your men can in some way combine this with their regular duties... We'll be able to handle all the notifications, posting all police stations, farms, etc. We'll provide a description. But if my men have to make trips outside of their duties then I'm afraid it'll have to be an impost on your department. If they are out on other jobs at the same time, there would be no extra expense. I'll concede that, Mr Neville. And it is the job of every one of your men in their role as local protectors. My men will do their jobs, Mr Neville. - Now, a week ago, you said. - Yes. Hey, Maude. Your girls have gone. Whafd you say? They've run away from Moore River. They're gone. Everybody's looking for 'em. And what do you think you might be up to? Thieving my eggs, eh? You come out here where I can see you. Come on. Stand up. Out you come. And get rid of that bread. It's filthy. You want something to eat, you ask for it. Come on. I'm not gonna bite you. You're on your own? Hm'? Got anyone with you? Here you are, Father. Where you girls planning on going? Cat got your tongue, eh? Now get. Go on. And watch out for those boys further along. They go out hunting rabbits along the fence. - That rabbit-proof fence? - Yes, the rabbit-proof fence. - Where that rabbit fence? - East. Which way now? That way. That fence. Find that rabbit fence, we go home. Then we see our mum. "The Chief Protector of Aborigines, MrA.O. Neville..." Devil! "..Is concerned about three native girls, "ranging from 8 to 14 years of age, "who a month ago ran away from "the Moore River Native Settlement.“ Yay! "He would be grateful if any person who saw them "would notify him...promptly. “We have been searching high and low for the children "'for a month past,' added Mr Neville...“ Devil! ...'"and all the trace we found of them was a dead rabbit.“ It's the fence, ifs the fence! She found it! The latest sighting, which is four days old, has them... - The man from the newspaper. - Nothing more to say to him. Please, may I have a look? Now, Albany, yes? Bunnawarra. Yalgoo... Dalwallinu... Bunnawarrafldgoo. Dalwallinu, Bunnawarra, Yalgoo. They're on the fence. They're following the rabbit-proof fence. Right! Just because a people use Neolithic tools, Inspector, does not mean they have Neolithic minds. This makes our task very much easier. Look. There's a branch off here to the west, north of Yalgoo. Now, you put your man out here on the fence north of thisjunction. He can start to come down it to meet them, while our Moodoo comes up from the south behind them. We can't miss them. Where Daisy? Wait here. My legs, Molly. They hurt. I can't walk. I'm carrying you only once, alright? Come on. Come on... Don't think I'm carrying you all the way. Camp, Molly! Company'- Where you girls headed? You going to Mullewa? You got family there? Where Mullewa? Mullewa? West. The way you're headed, along the number two fence. They got two rabbit-proof fence? My oath. They got three of 'em. We're on the wrong fence. Where that north fence? North fence? Back that way- where you come from. You can cut across. I'll show you. Number one rabbit fence. Here's the number two fence. Now you're here. But you wanna be here. Now, if you cut across here, you save yourself a hundred mile or so. It's not hard. I'm going back. I don't have the petrol. Over here. And we're hungry. Youse that lot from Moore River? Yeah. What, you girls walk all that way? Mmm. 800 miles? I was there. Too scared to run away, but. Everyone was always caught, stuck in that boob. Youse got the furtherest. Where you heading? Home. Mavis! Stay here. I'll come back and get you. You can sleep with me tonight. I'll get you some food. Just getting the washing, Mrs Evans! Shh. What's that? Someone coming. Quick, in the bed. Under the blankets. What are you playing at, Mavis? - Mr Evans. - I'll get you for this. - Go away. - Don't you worry about that! Come on, quick. Get up. Get up. Come on. 'Shh! Don't go, Molly. Please don't go. He come back if you go. Don't go. He won't say anything. Please. - Hello, Evans. - Hello. Quick, wake up! Wake up! Gotta go. Let's have a look. Run that way and just keep going. They were running out over there. About an hour or so ago. We'll pick up their tracks in the morning. I'll make a cup of tea. That's the tracker. Yeah, that's him. Hop on. I do not expect you to understand what I am trying to do for these people, but I will not have my plans put into jeopardy. People fail to understand that the problem of half-castes is not simply going to go away. If it is not dealt with now, ii will fester for years to come. These children are that problem. Please explain exactly what happened. I don't know how they did it, but we lost them. I had Larsen out there. Moodoo was with him. And we lost them. They're making right fools of us. They are indeed, Inspector, and the cost is more than to just our pride. This department's reputation is beginning to suffer. I can assure you that my men have better things to do than chase your charges all around the country. Now...they're coming into very rough terrain. Once they're much past Meekatharra I can't risk any of my men. I agree - we must find them before they get into the real desert country. So this is what we're going to do. You get your man out there. Moodoo can join him. Well up the fence, around here, mmm? Far enough up so that we know we cannot possibly miss them. And I want them to stay there. They can set up camp and wait. Costly. We'll just have to bear it. Their lives may be at stake. And, Inspector, I understand the mother of one of the girls has gone to Wiluna. The children are headed into that country. I want the word spread. Let's see what that does. You wouldn't get me out there. She's pretty clever, that girl. She wants to go home. Good thing you kids ran into me. Lot of people worried for you. The police are up and down the country looking for youse. It's in all the papers. Which one of you's Gracie? You Gracie? I hear your mummy in Wiluna. You can catch a train there from Meeka. Come on. Let's go. - Wiluna. She at Wiluna? - Yes. Come on, Gracie. Don't listen to him. He's a liar. Maybe she's there, Molly. Maybe he telling the truth. Molly? Let's go to Meeka, catch a train to Wiluna. They see us, they'll catch us. We can't stop now. Must keep going. We're nearly there. But Molly...Mummy there. She at Wiluna. I want Mummy. Come on. Come on, Daisy. Come on, Daisy. You have to carry me, Molly. Hop on. She's not coming. Don't look back. Don't look back, She'll come. Higher. You got 'em? Three! One for you, one for me... And one for both of us. Mmm. Come on, um. We goth go back for Grade. Go! What are you gonna do, sell the beast or what'? - I've got her. - I wanna get the train to Mummy! This one's mummy's here. Gracie... Oi! Grab her! Gotcha. Thanks, Jackie. There'll be a shilling for you back at the station. Taking you back where you belong. She gone, Molly. She not coming back. Needle in a haystack. That's n. Pack your stuff! We're getting out of here. They're only paying us for three weeks. "To Constable Riggs, police station, Nullagine. "The two missing half-caste girls Molly and Daisy "are returning to Jigalong via the rabbit-proof fence, "our efforts to apprehend them thus far having come to nought. "I therefore expect them to arrive in Jigalong "in about a month's time. “In your capacity as local protector "you are to proceed to Jigalong to await their arrival "and effect their recapture." Yours, etc. No fence. I want Mother. That fence'll come back. Home. It's coming through now. "Riggs arrived Jigalong. "Awaits your instructions.“ Yes, there will be a reply. Please wait. "Girls to be sent south via Meekatharra. "To be accompanied at all times. "Awaiting notification." What's all that about? Just some women's business. Been going on all day. "Hey. Molly? 'Mmm? That tracker. He not gonna get us now. No, he not gonna get us. I'm not gonna stay here. I can feel it. They're up to something. I'm gonna go take a look. I lost one. - What? - I lost one. "To Constable Riggs, police station, Nullagine. “At present we lack the funds to pursue "the missing half-caste girls Molly and Daisy. "I would ask to be kept informed of their whereabouts "so that at some future date they may indeed be...recovered. "We face an uphill battle with these people, "especially the bush natives, "who have to be protected against themselves. "If they would only understand "what we are trying to do for them.“ Yours, etc. Thank you.
