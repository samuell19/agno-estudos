Do a little move. Go on, shake those hips! C'mon, Aïssa, get on down! Cool moves, huh? THE RIGHT WORDS - What're you doing? - Hang on. Why are you filming? "Jada, Jada, I love your eyes Best of all, you have two... You're an icon Nothing like all those clowns." - Stop filming. - Stop it. Look! Leave him alone, you big kid! Stop that. - Why are you laughing? - No reason. Let me in on the joke. - No, Shakespeare! - You been in my bag? - You're so cute! - Screw you! Poor kid! - Jada, Jada... - Quiet... - Jada, Jada! - Shut up. She's over there. My stuff is private. You didn't put it on Snapchat? - You're such a kid! Delete it. - Why should I? Why do you rat people out? You ratted on me to Dad. You're such a kid! I don't believe it! Give it here. I won't delete it. Give it to Jada. It's well written. - I didn't write it. - Who did, then? The internet. Even on the net, there aren't such corny poems! Delete it, man. - You're so touchy. It's funny. - It isn't. - It is. - Why? - You were laughing. - Well, it's not funny. - It is. - You're making yourself look bad. - Who you talkin' to? - You. You were laughing. Yeah, but enough is enough. He did the same to me. - So? - Well, I want to. - Just grow up, Kenza. - What? You need to grow up. - Get a sense of humor. - What? Why are you shouting? - I got an idea. - Screw your idea. I got a great idea. - I don't care. - Go see her with your poem. - No, I'll look a fool. - Hey, you're a cute guy. I reckon you're in with a chance. Look, mind your own business. Get off my back. I think she's moving house. What? Jada's moving house? Yeah, she's moving house and changing schools. Her sister is. Maybe she's not. Cut the crap. In the middle of the school year? Her father's been transferred. They're leaving. Transferred? Look, it's now or never. You don't have a clue. No, you don't. You little virgin! - I'm a virgin? - You bet! Don't push me. Calm down, you two. Just delete it. No, I won't now. He can just go see her. - I won't. - Go on, Mahdi. Look, if you don't have the balls... It's now or never. - She's moving? - Yes! There's a seat next to her. Go on! Go, go, go! - He'll get blown out, bro. - It'll work. What the hell? No other free seats. I don't care. We're sitting here. Where are you off to? To the mall. The mall. You're Kenza's brother? She's a dirty bitch! Beat it. - Bull! - He's a great rapper. What about Dadju? What? Forget Dadju! Forget him and his music. - What's in your hair? - Shut up! Ugh, it's chewing gum! Did Kylian do that? The bastard! Got any scissors? So, did it work? - I don't know... - What do you mean? Tell me! - Shut up! - What? Speak! So? How are things with Jada? - I'll do it. - Get off! - I'll do it. - Speak! - I'll do it. - Get off! - Tell us. - You do it, then. OK, go on. And you get off my back. - You can cut hair? - Shut up. Oh, it's so gross! - It's your fault. - Poor little baby! - What do I say to her? - At last! There are techniques. Like what? First off... Don't say you like her. - Do the opposite of your crappy poem. - Is that your technique? - He'll bomb, bro. - What do you know about it? Nothing! What do you know? Yeah, what do you know? You've only ever touched your Mom, you virgin! Be romantic. - Romantic? - Yeah. What the hell? So, you think romance will work on Jada? "My darling..." - Come on... - No, you gotta act tough. Look her in the eye and show you're in control. - And synchronize with her. - What? - Do what she does, dufus. - C'mon, help me out here. Look at me and Aïssa. It's like hypnosis. It sends a signal. - Then, act tough. - Tough? - How? - She's talking crap. Don't listen. No, I ain't! Look at him. How can it work with your advice? - He just doesn't get it. - Bullshit! My advice is tried and tested. Just be yourself. - Forget that. Take my glasses. - What for? And take that. Chicks like intellectuals. It's good advice. Listen to your favorite sister. Don't tell her you like her. - What? - What, what? - "Don't tell her you like her"? - Yeah. Girl's glasses and "Act tough"?! I'm sick of your shitty advice. I'm done with you. She's getting off. Go on, Mahdi. Life isn't on Snapchat! Go on, go talk to her! Mister, my friend's fainted! - What? - Get down! Jada, Jada... - You OK? - Uh, yeah. Call an ambulance. She's not well. - She doesn't feel well. - OK, I'll call an ambulance. I saw you looking at me. - I did what? - Admit it. I can see you're into me. - Well, I like you, too. - You're nuts! Let's take it slow. I don't want a serious relationship. - What? - Admit it. You watch me in school, too. - Are you in my school? - Cut it out. What're you talking about? Get real. You're embarrassing me in front of everyone. Oh, wow! Let's go out before you move. I'm not. You got the wrong girl. Really? I gotta go. My grandma's waiting. - Wait... - What the hell? Sorry about that. I was talking crap. I'm sorry. My sister told me to act tough. - You're such a kid! - Sorry. She put my poem to you on the net. It's not my fault. - You wrote me a poem? - Yeah. I really like you, see? You're so pretty. You've got beautiful eyes. I wanna get to know you. I want to marry you, Jada. Does he need to piss?! Look at him. Snap this! Want to go to the movies with me? To the movies? I don't know. What're you doing? Oh, I love "Anne Frank". Yeah, great. Glad you like it. It's a gift. Oh, thanks. You like the character? Her diary is such a blast! - Sure you read it? - Yeah. - Is that another lie? - I read it... It's working. Bitch! What's going on? 2 o'clock at the mall. She dumped him! Really? 2 o'clock.
