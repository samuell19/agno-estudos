There was a different kind of casting call in Chicagoland this past week, it was for the lead in a Hollywood movie, but to qualify four legs, a shiny coat, and some attitude are required. A star could be born right here in Atlanta. A movie producer is in town looking for the actor with that special something. His first and only stop? The Humane Society. The creator of Benji is on the hunt for a new generation of the canine hero and he's looking right here in the Twin Cities. And now Benji's creator is searching for the new Benji here in the animal shelters of Phoenix. Oh man. What a good puppy. I'm different, too, don't worry about it. You're the cutest. Hey girl, you hungry? Brought the good stuff this time, canned stuff. Hmm! You're gonna like this. Okay, take care now. Stay inside, no wandering about. See ya later. What's this? You stole this dog from me. No, I didn't, she got loose on her own. Don't give me that. This is the most rare, most expensive breeder I got. Now look what's happened. It's gotten tied up with some mongrel and had mixed breed puppies. Probably these, too. Leastwise they look like their mama so I can probably still sell 'em for pure. I'm 'bout inclined to sell you, too, or something worse. Now pick up these pups and get your butt in the truck. You hear what I said, boy? Pick up these puppies. Did you forget that you slung one clear across the room? Not that one, I can't get nothing for no mutts so it ain't going on the payroll. Get the black ones. What's gonna happen to this one? Not my concern. Now move it. You leave him here, he'll die. What's your point? Hurry up and finish that and get up to your room. No dinner for you tonight. Puppy Puppy. Puppy? Hello. Merlin, this is Puppy. You're gonna have to watch after him. Uh-oh. This will be your home for a while. Merlin will keep you company when I'm not around and I'll try to dig up some things for you to play with. First I'll get you some water. Aw, you can't even eat for yourself yet. Hope you appreciate me. Now you stay. I'll be back. I'll be back, I'll be back. Uh-oh. Come on, Daisy. Come on, Daisy. Down. Let's go, Daisy. Come on, let's go. Hello? Hello? I'll be back. What a good puppy. Be sweet later, let's get the feeding thing done. It's way past my bedtime. Be sweet later. Kissy kissy. Kissy kissy? Where'd you get that. Uh-oh, past my bedtime. Get rid of the bird. Okay. Yeah, okay. But he's a stray, we gotta get him. We got more important business. We're on the hunt. Major investigation, remember? But it's our job, we gotta get him. Our job is bigger than one mutt. You said you wanted to move up, the mutt can wait. It doesn't matter, he's gone. No he's not. That is the longest tongue I have ever seen. Wait here. Come here poochy woochy. Cute little bundle of fluff with a tongue long enough to be a lizard. Hang on a minute, I'll flank him. Come on now. I got you. Come here, you little lizard tongue. That's it, he's mine. I say we forget him. We got bigger work. No, work will have to wait. Hello, 911? Do you think you're as smart as me? Do ya? Do you have my education? Have you been breeding dogs as long as I have? Doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that she's sick. You little-- I don't think so. Don't worry, mom, he wouldn't dare. You got no respect. Neither of you. I just think she should get well before you put her through another litter. The book says that-- I don't care what the book says. The book don't pay my bills. Now get out there like I told ya and walk that dog. And then put her in old Duke's cage. How are you, girl, huh? Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on, it's okay. Come on. Let's go for a walk. Let's go. Gee girl, do you think we should drop in on Puppy? Hello? Come in now. Kissy kissy. Gross. It's not gross, you're gross. Uh-oh. Allsystems operational. Uh-oh. Full power, perimeter's all clear. Uh-oh. Why didn't you warn me? Oh, so you did. Sorry, ring the bell next time. Too loud. Do you wanna go back to the humane society? Yeah well, don't be a butthead, no talking back. Don't be a butthead. No, stay. You know the drill, jump in, jump out, go to the sleeping bag, whatever. Come on, girl. No, you mustn't tell him, he'd make life miserable for you and the puppy. But he's not a puppy anymore, he's fully grown. I can't keep him locked up forever. Except for when I walk him, whenever gets out of that fort. Please, don't irritate your father, we'll all be the worse for it. Just sit down and have your lunch. Come on, the puppy will be fine. What I really want is to have him for my dog. As I said, don't irritate your father. Why do you stay with him? He doesn't love you. Two parents are better than one. Besides, we gotta eat. Mr. Paul down at the market keeps asking me why you don't come back. And why don't I go to law school like I wanted to? Because my place is here looking after you. Because he won't let you. Like I said, he doesn't love you, and he doesn't love me. You don't treat folks you love like he treats us. Oh you don't, do ya? No, you don't. Don't you go out that door. You hear me? Get back in here this minute. See? Look at this mess. It's a crummy breeding factory is what it is. Man, we gotta get this guy. I don't see any laws broken. You know there are. You just gotta find 'em. We need a search warrant. Nobody's gonna give us a search warrant without just cause. We'll just have to catch him in the act. Well we gotta be on this guy 24/7, stuck to him like glue. We need to pitch a tent right. It's lizard tongue! Will you shut up? -We are trespassing. -Whoa, whoa. Now do you want us to get, oh. Go after him. Oh my God, get him. I think I'll go in and take Puppy for a walk now. He went that way, it was him, I swear it. Ah, I think you're seeing things. No, I swear it was him. Come on, we gotta go after him. Let's go. If we go we're going calmly and quietly and with a plan. I'll get the tranquilizer gun. What's the matter with you? Uh oh, get rid of the bird. What is this? This yours? And what is Daisy doing out here? And who's that? It's that mixed breed puppy, ain't it? Should've done away with that mutt when it was born. -I'll take care of that now. -No, you leave him alone. Are we interrupting something? Hello. Hey, we've got a leash law, ya know? My property. This is Mississippi Forestry land, Sir. Well pick nits, it adjoins my property. That dog doesn't look too healthy. Is she a breeder? I don't breed much. Well, not her. Well, just every once in a while. We know exactly how much you've been breeding and we're gonna be watching you. Watching you. Exactly. We're watching you, buddy. One misstep, just one, maybe two, you're gone, you're ours. And we're gonna be all over you like a wet blanket. Yeah, one misstep, trust me. Oh, yeah. Be back in an hour or maybe sooner. Oh, Mr. Finch? Hey, Mr. Finch. Mr. Finch? Who's responsible for this? Show yourself right now. Well this is thievery, stealing. Repent and you shall be forgiven. Ask and you shall receive. Steal and you get your head blown off. Might as well finish it off, I'm not eating after you. Whoever you are. Okay, he's right there, right? Just over the bunker? Right, he's right there. In the range of the tranq gun? He's not six feet away, these eyes don't lie. Are you absolutely sure? I told you these eyes don't lie. Okay, here goes. He's not here. I'm thinking you missed. Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. Really? So what'd he do then? He just laughed and said you're exactly right, Colby, so everybody gets out 10 minutes early and the class went nuts. Ah, that's great. So you're a big hero. He's really nice. Yeah. It takes a special kind of person to admit he's wrong. Yeah, it does. Well, so, what's happening in social studies? India. Ancient India. I liked Greece better. Do you know that's where the Olympics started? I did. Back in a minute. You stay well now. What's this bike doing in the driveway? So you don't even say thank you. What kind of upbringing is that? Don't you have any manners at all? Shame on you. You hear what I say? Shame on you. Uh oh. Gotcha! You're mine now, you mixed mutt. I'll be waiting for you! Butthead. Morning, Mr. Finch. I've got your delivery bright and early just like you said. It's not just like I said, the day is half gone. Those whose lives are spent in bed will never prosper it is said. Ebenezer Payne. Yes sir, sorry. And what's with the dog food? Did you get a dog? Mind your business, don't mind mine, only thence your star will shine. Ebenezer Payne? You'll go far, son. Mr. Finch, who is Ebenezer Payne? We haven't studied him in school. Well, of course not. I made him up. It's all clear, come on. Would you please tell me again why I'm dragging my belly through cockleburrs and stickers. For the greater good. We're gonna nail this Hatchett guy, we have to catch him in the act. Doing what? Something illegal. Anything that doesn't pass muster. What's muster? Oh, get down. Where do you suppose he's going? I don't know, but we've gotta follow him. Take a look. It's him. I know it's him, now move out we gotta follow him. No, not that him, the other him. What are you talking about? Will you move out before we lose him. The dog him, he's right there. The dog, the miserable scum of a lizard tongue dog. Will you pull yourself together? We got bigger business than that dog. Gimme the tranq gun. Yeah, I'll give it to ya, same place I gave it to ya last time, now move out, soldier. He is the devil. We saw that, Mr. Hatchett. Saw every bit of it. I beg your pardon. We saw exactly what you did. -Shut up. -Ow. We saw exactly what you did. Hey look, I'm sorry, and I'm not one to litter especially in this beautiful river. But I brought my lunch up today and... I know, trash in the river, it's not right. Look, if you don't tell I promise not to do it again. What do ya say? It wasn't your lunch, Mr. Hatchett. No, it wasn't. Prove it. Hey, he threw that sack over in the water, let's go find it. Come on. Who's there? Hey, get out of here! Filthy mongrel. You show up around here again you're food for the worms. Yeah, I caught ya at last. Ah, you're not very hungry tonight. And I'll expect you to replace the flower pot. At least clean up the mess. You again. You the one been getting to my females, you mangy mutt? Ain't you the dumb one. Come here. Come on, let me get my hands around your little neck. You. No, you leave him alone. Feed the dogs. Now! Yes? Something I can do for you? I believe there is, Mr. Zachariah Finch. One and the same. We understand that you've had a stray dog coming around here on occasion. Now how would you be understanding something like that? Well, that would be none of your business. Would it? Or maybe it would be. One Dudley Morrison, I believe he delivers your groceries, says you've been buying dog food lately but you don't seem to have a dog. Yeah, and I think there's some of that dog food right in this bowl right over here. It's him, it's lizard tongue! Is this your dog? 'Cause if it is you're in big trouble 'cause that dog has been running wild all over the c-- Ow. Sorry about my associate, he's an idiot. But I do need to know if this is your dog. I don't see a dog. Do you see a dog? I put that food out there for the otters. Otters? Yeah, they're good to have around. They keep the bears away. We don't have any bears in these parts. Hey, see, it's the otters. Now if you gentlemen will excuse me I have a souffle in the oven. Wait, I have a few more questions here, Mr. Finch. Mr. Finch? He's the devil, you know. Mr. Finch? No, that mutt. He's messing with our minds. Did you know that about the otters? I don't care about otters, I care about finding that mutt. I think it's interesting. I mean, if a little bitty otter could intimidate a great big bear. No different than a little dog intimidating two great big men. I feel like we're being followed. Lizard tongue? Now be calm, we can do this. We just have to be calm. We can't chase him, we have to become his buddies. His friends. I can't do that, this is lizard tongue you're talking about. Your butt doesn't still hurt because of lizard tongue. I still got mud in my nose because of lizard tongue. Just follow my lead and this'll be a snap. Hi there, lizard tongue, how you doing today? Isn't this a great day? Let's go for a walk. Yeah, go for a little walk. Right on, huh, Sheldon? Just a friendly walk in the woods. ♪ Friendly walk in the woods ♪ ♪ With a tranquilizer gun ♪ We need to keep him close so be calm. Don't chase him. I gotcha. I told you not to chase him. Go after him. Come on, hurry up. There he is, spread out and go slow. I almost had him! Why you lookin' at me for? Let's go get him. Grab my hand, Sundance. I'm gonna Sundance your butt right over the bottom of this river. Why, that dog's got more brains than you do. -Hey. -How did... Did you see that? I do, I'll throw you right down there after him. I can't believe it! Do I know you? Well, well, well. Looks to me like you've been abandoned. It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt ya. Go ahead and eat your fill, I'll just sit over here, rest my bones, I'll talk to the weeds. It's a cold cruel world out there, ya know? Hard to get along all on your own, nobody to talk to. Don't ya think? That, Mr. Shaggy Dog, is the longest tongue I've ever seen. What happened to that tail? Looks like you were wagging when you should've been running. I can see you've been out on those streets for a while. All you need's a bit of good old-fashioned TLC. I can do that as long as you don't tell anybody. Yes. Good boy. That's a good boy. What is it? Oh. This soup's ice-cold. It's supposed to be, it's cold potato soup. I like my soup hot. It's French. It's called vichyssoise. I don't care what it's called, it's not soup if it's cold, it's something else. The macaroni's cold too. It's pasta salad and it's supposed to be cold. This is a light Summer dinner. When I've been working since dawn I expect a good hot meal not this pansy cold Frenchy stuff. Just sit right back down and I'll make you a big bowl of hot bean soup, okay? It'll be really good, really good. Colby. No, no, no, you just sit and enjoy each other, okay? No, no, no, just sit right back down. You're gonna love it but it'll take one more minute. Leave me be, boy, I was just getting a beer. Mom will do that. Right, mama? Wrong, I'm not getting him a beer. Mom, we messed up his dinner trying to make him something special, now we gotta make it up to him. You just sit here and be waited on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, sit right back down. I'll just be one more minute. I was just getting my paper on the porch. I told ya, we're here to take care of ya. Right, Mama? Come on. I'm telling you I have nothing to do with it. I have no idea where she is. Get your butt outta the truck and we'll find out. Why would she be here? Because this is where you put her last time. I didn't put her here last time, and if I did, why would I be so stupid as to bring her here again? Because you think I'm stupid, that's why. We'll find out who's stupid, won't we? All right, up the stairs. Ha! She's gotta be here somewhere. Ha. South County Animal Care and Control. Oh I know very well who you are, Mr. Hatchett, you're rather well documented around here. Is that a fact? And you're calling us for help? Base to unit one, unit one come in. This is unit one, over. I just received a very interesting phone call. I think you're wrong. That old house would be a good hideout, nobody lives there. How would she get in? Besides, dogs go where there are people, where there's food, they don't have sense enough to hide out. Oh, don't tell me dogs don't have sense. Lizard tongue has plenty of sense. So far he managed to outwit me. I just can't believe that jerk would have the gall to ask us for help. We, who would love nothing better than to nail him good. This could be our big chance. If we can just get our hands on that black dog. If we could just get our hands on that dog we'd, we'd... What? Well, we'd give her a complete medical workup for one, examine her from top to bottom so-to-speak. Whatever's wrong with her we can lay on Hatchett and we'll have evidence to take him to court. Stop the car! Hey, it's the tongue's buddy. Almost not. Come on, let's get him. Hold it, we've gotta focus on the priority. Right. Which is? The missing dog, the one that'll nail Hatchett. Exactly. What about this one? Guarantee the minute you make a move toward him he's gone. Get him out of the street and let's go. I don't see how you deal with it every day. It's a depressing job. And yours isn't? My job is about helping people most of the time. Well my job's about helping people too by helping animals. Yeah, but look how many you have to, you know. Not nearly as many as when I started here and I can feel good about that. Anyway, finish up, get outta here, I've got work to do. Enjoyed lunch. Movie tonight? Who's buying? On me, my lady. -I'm in. -I'll call ya. Oh, Ozzie, wait a minute. I've got a situation here and wondered if maybe. Uh-oh. It's just a little favor. We've been down this street before. I don't think so. Oh, oh I know so. How do you know so? 'Cause there's that dog again. What's with him? It's like he wants us to nab him. Maybe he wants us to follow him. Maybe he knows where that black dog is. Oh, right, like in the Lassie movies where the dog was smarter than the people. Exactly. It's possible. In your case it's probable. This is not a nice guy, Ozzie. I don't know, you need some kind of probable cause-- Sheldon and Livingston have seen the backyard, they're pretty sure the dog shelters don't conform to the law. Sheldon and Livingston. I wouldn't wanna rest my case on those two. My point exactly, that's why I want you out there. Check it out yourself, let him know he's being watched. How could they not know with the bumble twins snooping around? Ozzie. If you find that dog and she's been abused then you'll have a case. His dogs are being treated poorly. It's clear he doesn't care about them. Oh, except for the puppies he can sell. There is no telling what all is going on out there and-- Let me do some research. What's the guy's name? Hatchett. Terrence Muncie Hatchett. Lives out east just outta town? What? Not sure. Let me check it out. I'll call you. Thanks, Oz. Uh-oh. Empty. Nada, zero. I bet you that bird knows where he is. Nada, zero. Get rid of the bird. The bird knows, the dog knows. What are ya, Doctor Doolittle? Well I might be. You know, they all laughed at him, too. -In the beginning. -Oh, come on, let's go. Livingston, I'm telling ya, we should follow this dog he's telling us something. What exactly is he telling us? -He... He... You think I'm being stupid don't ya? In a word yes. Now come on. You can do this, ya hear me? No matter how hard it gets, no matter how long it takes, you can do this. You can rise above the simple folk who think animals are stupid, who think-- -Sheldon! -Coming! Just remember, keep the faith, you can do this. South County Animal Care and Control. Hey, it's me. I was right, this guy Hatchett has a record. Animal abuse? People abuse, his wife and their kid. He was given a stiff warning but promised it wouldn't happen again. We can't wait, Ozzie. We don't wanna have to say we had a chance to do something and we didn't. All right, I'll pay him a friendly visit. What do you want? Come on, don't be silly, you know I scan the police radio. This is big. You gonna arrest him, take him to jail? Oh, hang on, let me turn on my tape recorder. Do not turn on the recorder, do not follow me up there. Do get into your car and leave here immediately. Oh, come on, Ozzie, give me a break. My listeners wanna know. Know this: if you're not out of here in ten seconds you're gonna be broadcasting from a jail cell. At least tell me why you're here. He's mistreating the dogs, right? Puppy mill, miserable conditions. He's reported by every neighbor in South County. It's a social call. Oh, jeez. Mr. Hatchett? Can I help you? I'd like to ask you a few questions. Can I see your backyard? Is it about our dog that's missing? She's awful sick and-- Didn't I tell you to go on about your chores? Why do you wanna see the backyard? We've done nothing wrong. Nobody's saying you have but there are a few questions. And if I say no? Mr. Hatchett, I can report that you're being uncooperative, I can get a search warrant, I can take your last citation before Judge Williams or I can report that you're being very cooperative and that everything's gonna be just fine. We're never gonna find her this way. We've been up and down every street in town six times. What do you suggest, Dr. D, that we stop and ask a squirrel? No, I suggest we get outta this vehicle and go look under some of these houses. You know, prowl the back alleys, go where a dog on the run would go. Oh, now you know where a dog on the run would go. Do you realize that we are two, just two. It would take us days, weeks, to check under every house in this town. How are we gonna do that, huh Fine, then stop and I'll ask a squirrel. Better yet, stop and I'll ask lizard tongue. What are you talking about? The tongue, he's right here, and the other one too. Livingston! I've had enough of this. I'm gonna do something productive. I'm either gonna catch me a lizard tongue or find out why the devil they won't leave us alone. Sheldon, get back in the van we have work to do. I'm about the business of doing it. Gentlemen, start your engines. Doctor Doolittle, indeed. It's okay, mama. Everything is gonna be okay now. Sheldon, you in there? I don't believe it. I'll take my told ya so's later but we gotta get her to the clinic right now. How did you? -Now, Livingston. Help me. I wanna see it cleaned up under those cages and more shade for the dogs, an exercise area in place, and fresh water in every cage when I get back. Is that clear? Anything else? I'll let you know after I do a bit of research. On what? Like I said, I'll let you know. And the news of the day here in South County is the police visit to the Terrence Hatchett household all along the QT of course but your journalist was there on the scene and saw it happen. No comment from the Hatchetts or the officer in charge, Sergeant Oswald Lewis, but this: from neighbor Zelda Pinkstrum. I just say it's about time because everybody knows the awful way he treats those dogs. They're his breeding machines is what they are. I heard he was selling the puppies to some foreign country for who knows what. My sister Betty Lou down at the pet store-- He buys the cheapest food and not near enough for 100 dogs. That's what I heard, a hundred dogs. Of course, I ain't actually seen 'em to count. Ooh, it looks like headaches for the Hatchetts. And we'd like to thank Zelda for telling us like it is. The lines are now open for anyone else who has inside info-- We've gotta do something, Merlin. I gotta do something. Be sweet later. Yeah. I'll be back, I'll be back. She's dehydrated and anemic and infected with hookworms. I've started an IV and an antibiotic. I think she might also have a mammary tumor from too much nursing. Now all that we can deal with, the larger issue is she has pyometra. What's pyometra? It's an infected uterus from overbreeding. It's a fast-moving awful condition and without immediate surgery we could lose her. And I mean surgery right now. She'll have to be spayed in the process. -She won't breed again. -Can't do it, honey, not without clearing it with Hatchett. I was hoping he wasn't at home then at least we could say we tried. How do you know he's home. Busy. Lady, I don't care what you think or what the radio station thinks, my dogs are my business. Hello? No, I have done nothing of the sort. I love my dogs now stop calling here. I'm warning you people. No, I have 10 dogs, that's it, 10. You're my witnesses. Seven, eight, nine, 10 rings. We tried. Yeah. Dr. Garret. Yes, ma'am? Proceed with the surgery, save the dog's life, please. I'll do my best. Hey, what's going on out here? You did what? Do you have any idea how rare that dog is? And now she's worthless. She would've died if we hadn't operated. I can't believe you people. You wanna fix every dog in sight. Well this time you overstepped the line, young lady. You had no right to do what you did. That dog belongs to me. We had an obligation to save her life if we could. The only obligation you had was to me. Nancy called, is everything okay? No, everything is not okay. We tried to reach you, you weren't at home. That was my prize breeder. I believe you told an animal control officer that you rarely breed her. She... She was-- She was being way overbred, that's why she was so sick. Now, I assume that since she can no longer have puppies you will have no further need of her. We will find her a good home. Oh, no, not on your life. -She's coming home with me. You have no use for her. Oh, yes, I do. She'll be my evidence when I take you people to court. Now get me my dog. Ooh, did you spend a night in a garbage bin? Calm down, calm down, it's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be all right, I promise. You can talk to these guys, go on, tell him. No, there's no use in getting his hopes up. Nah, I think you should tell him, this could be a big deal. -No, I don't think so. Why not? He might not want any part of it. A dog should be able to make his own decisions on stuff like this. And if you build up his hopes for nothing? What then, huh? You have no compassion. What do you mean build up his hopes for nothing? It's not gonna be for nothing. Just look at that face. Well, look at that. It's the mutt you been hiding out in the woods, ain't it? That's our dog they're trying to run off with. Our dog. Our dog? Even if it was the same dog it's not our dog, you left that puppy to die. Well, not anymore. They're gonna pay if they think they're gonna make our dog a star, pay big. Those animal people owe me. Go put on a decent shirt, we're gonna go down there and claim our dog. I don't wanna go. Well, what you want makes me no nevermind. You're going and you're gonna tell them it's your dog, it'll play better coming from a kid. You're going, too. We're gonna go down there as a family, To claim our dog, or our reward. I'm not going. Oh, yes, you are. We picked him up three days ago. Legally he now belongs to animal care and control to do with as we feel best. Look, you don't understand, okay? The legal issue doesn't matter. If this dog belongs to that young boy then we're not taking him away, okay? We're just not. I don't care what the law says. The dog has been on the street for a long time. These guys have seen him and I'm telling you that guy out there is a bad dude. He lies, mistreats dogs. The one out there almost died because of him. And there's gotta be some connection. This dog is the reason that dog's alive. He led us right to her. He did, really did, right to her. Well, you're never gonna convince me that that kid is gonna come in here and lie, so if it's his dog it stays his dog. I guess, we'll bring him in. All right, y'all can come on in now. Go on, tell 'em. Tell 'em it's your dog. What's your name? Colby. Well, Colby, they tell me this dog has been on the street for some time. How are you gonna be sure that it's your dog? I'll know. She'll know. Go on. Well go and tell 'em. Tell 'em it's your dog. I'm sorry, mister, there must be some mistake. This isn't my dog. What do you mean this isn't your dog? This most definitely is your dog. Do you hear me? You tell 'em this is your dog right now. Just calm yourself down, Mr. Hatchett. Get your hands off me. Either you calm down or you'll be spending the rest of this day in a jail cell. Come on out here. If I were you I'd sit here nice and quiet and don't as much as move a muscle to go back in there. Hey, Nancy. Is everything all right in there? It's gonna be. Hey, it's me Ozzie. Darnell there? All right, thanks. Ozzie, he's getting away. I suspect a judge will be sending him to a nice place where he can get some help and in the meantime he won't be around to do any more harm to you guys or your dogs. So it is your dog after all? It's her dog. Well, son, the last thing we wanna do is take your dog away. No, no you got it all wrong. I wouldn't do anything in the world to stop him from becoming Benji. This dog has had a really hard life. He deserves something good. I love him very much but if you think he could be a star... Well... Looks to me like he already is. Just one thing, if maybe... I could come visit him every once in a while? Oh, well, I think we can fix it so that you can come and visit him any time you want. How about that? Looks to me like it's time to call in the favors, dude. ♪ It had to be you ♪ ♪ It had to be you ♪ ♪ I wandered around and finally found ♪ ♪ The somebody who ♪ ♪ Could make me be true ♪ ♪ Could make be blue ♪ ♪ Or even be glad just to be sad thinking of you ♪ ♪ Some others I've seen ♪ ♪ Might never be me ♪ ♪ Might never be cross ♪ ♪ Or try to be boss ♪ ♪ They wouldn't do for nobody else ♪ ♪ Gave me that thrill ♪ ♪ With all your faults I love you still ♪ ♪ It had to be you ♪ ♪ Wonderful you ♪ ♪ Had to be you ♪ ♪ Some others have seen ♪ ♪ Might never be mean ♪ ♪ Might never be cross ♪ ♪ Tried to be boss ♪ ♪ They wouldn't do ♪ ♪ For nobody else gave me that thrill ♪ ♪ With all your faults I love you still ♪ ♪ It had to be you ♪ ♪ Wonderful you ♪ ♪ It had to be you ♪ ♪ Some others have seen ♪ ♪ Might never be mean ♪ ♪ Might never been cross ♪ ♪ Tried to be boss ♪ ♪ They wouldn't do ♪ ♪ For nobody else Gave me that thrill ♪ ♪ With all your faults Benji I love you still ♪ ♪ It had to be you ♪ ♪ Wonderful you ♪ ♪ Had to be you ♪
