Will you tell the wing commander that commander Lindsay would like to see him? - Is he expecting you, sir? - No. I'm sorry, sir, he's very busy. Will you tell him it's very urgent? If you can explain what the business is... I'll explain to him, personally. I'll try, sir. There's the air traffic controller, sir. - Perhaps he can help you. - I'm sorry, I know you're busy this morning. I'm commander Lindsay. I'd like to see the wing commander urgently. I'm sorry, sir. Anytime but now. You've heard the news this morning, haven't you? I have. That's why I'm here. - You've got some information? - I have something to say. Something that the wing commander must know. I see. Would you come this way? Come in. Commander Lindsay to see you, sir. I'm sorry to break in on you like this, but I had to see you. That's all right, commander, if you've something important to tell me. Perhaps I ought to explain something about myself. You don't have to, commander. I know you well by reputation. Well, I hope that's good enough for you to trust me because what I'm going to ask you to believe is... Was air marshal sir John hardie in this missing Dakota? I'm not at Liberty to give the names of the passengers. Was he? Have you any further news of it? No. It was last known to be flying northward over the mainland of Japan. Do you know the coastline of Japan well and the surrounding islands? I flew most of the air routes in the east for 20 years. Do you know of a small bay, wild, rocky, with steep cliffs, a headland with a small lighthouse on it, a straggling line of fishing huts on the beach, and two or three big, twisted rocks in the sea - around the headland? - Why do you ask me this? Do you know any part of the Japanese coast like that? It might apply to a great many parts of the coast. Wild and rocky up here, but that's the northwest. But are there lighthouses, small fishing villages? Lighthouses, certainly, because it's a treacherous coast. And fishing villages, plenty of them. Have you searched that area? My dear fellow, it's miles out. The last signal was at 1328 from here over the mainland. They were flying northeast direct for Tokyo. For all that, will you search that area, send everything you can? Aircraft, naval units, search parties, and comb that northwest coast at once. But I must have some reason, commander. If I did tell you, you'd laugh at me and do nothing. You've got to trust me and do what I say. But the last radio message was from here! There was heavy cloud and they were approaching high mountains. Everything suggests a crash in these mountains. The lives of all these people may be saved if you do what I ask. I'm not mad, I'm not a crank. I implore you to do this before it's too late. Ask the controller to come in, will you? Very good, sir. - Yes, sir? - That message from ss dollfuss that came in this morning, where did they report seeing this aircraft? Way out here, sir, more than 60 miles out in the sea of Japan. - Then it was seen! - I think for certain it was a naval aircraft off a carrier. - Did they give its direction? - No, sir, there was heavy mist. - What time was this report? - 1610. Then it's possible it could've been! All right. Send this message to Tokyo. Search area: Sado island and northwest coast from akita to toyama. Very good, sir. Well, commander, the message is gone. Would you explain things to me now? If I did, you'd cancel it. If this turns out to be a waste of time, I shall have a good deal to answer for. And if they do find them up there, perhaps I'll come back and explain everything. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Good day, sir. - Good day. I got that away, sir. They tell me commander Lindsay flew in from Singapore with the air marshal in this Dakota last Monday. Did he? So he did. You know, in a sense, this is my last lap. After this, I'm carrying on in a liberator. You're going the long way home, aren't you? Oh, yes, well, I met a lot of friends when we were operating in the pacific, some of them Americans who are now in Tokyo and Washington. I just thought it'd be a good idea to look them up on the way home. We'll be landing very soon, sir. Good. Oh, by the way, we'll be coming in on runway 1-3. If you've never flown into Hong Kong before, you'll be amazed at the approach we have to make. What does he mean by that? Runway 1-3, 13, ominous. You naval types seem to thrive on superstition. All the same, runway 1-3 has a very dicey approach. Bit of a corker, isn't it? Piece of cake. - Hello, sir. - How are you? Mr. robertson's called for you, sir. - Hello, Robbie. - Hello, John, how are you? - Fine. - Did you have a good trip? Yes, perfect, thanks. This is commander Lindsay. An old friend of mine, Mr. robertson. - How do you do? - How do you do? Lindsay, you're the new man - on the naval staff. - That's right. This is flight lieutenant McKenzie, my personal assistant. - How do you do? - How do you do, sir? I'll go and see about the luggage. - Right you are, Mac. - Where are you staying? I've got a room at the officer's club for the time being. Well, thanks for the lift, John. Very enjoyable flight. Don't mention it. I'll see you again before I go. What about lunch tomorrow? “Well... Are you doing anything for dinner tomorrow night? - No, nothing. - Why not dine with us? I'd like to very much. Just the family, my wife and daughter. I'll send a car to pick you up at the club. - 7:00 suit you? - Fine! I'll be ready. Strange people, the Chinese. The oldest civilization on earth, yet even today, so many of them allow their lives to be controlled by fears and superstitions that we laugh at as childish, medieval. What on earth's all that about? It's the ceremony of the returning spirit. For one night, the dead come back to spend a few hours in their old home. The relations do everything in their power to make it a happy return. Sounds like they're driving it away. No, no, they're driving the evil spirits away so that the good one may return in peace. How do they know when it's coming back? They're told through dreams and omens. Times have changed in China, but many families still cling to the old beliefs, customs that go back thousands of years. And do they believe what their dreams tell them? Well, they don't regard them as dreams quite in the way that we do. They regard them as visions of things to come. They believe that everything in their lives is preordained and a dream is a glimpse into the future sent for their guidance. Good thing the commander isn't a chinaman. Why, what's the commander been doing? He had the weirdest dream last night. It wasn't anything. Gave me the willies. Tell us what happened. Oh, I was tired, that's all. It was too much lobster for dinner. Well, I must be going. You're not going till you've told us about the dream. Besides, you haven't had your coffee yet, commander. No, no, I won't... - Yes, let's hear it. - Yes, come on, tell us, Lindsay. Oh... it was just a silly, jumbled-up affair like any other dream, all mixed up with that Dakota aircraft we flew in from Singapore yesterday. I wasn't in it myself, I was seeing it from the outside. I saw the passenger compartment. There were... six, seven... Eight people. One of them was a very attractive young woman. I'd been with you all day, so I suppose it was natural I should see you there. And one was a very important civilian. That must've been you, daddy. Honey, yes, I'm sure it was. Go on, what happened? Well, they were lost. They talked about the radio, it had failed. They were short of fuel, they only just had enough to get to the coast. You mean we were over the sea somewhere? I imagine so, they kept talking about the mainland. They were in very heavy cloud. It was snowing, it got darker and darker. Then suddenly, they were out of the cloud and there was a bay surrounded by reddish cliffs, a rock-strewn beach, a lighthouse on a small headland, and at one end of the beach, a sort of fishing village. It's an odd thing about dreams. You'll see a place vividly in every detail, and yet for the life of you, can't remember having seen it before. And you say I was in it? Yes. And it was a twin-engine plane, a Dakota? Yes, that's right. Really, commander, I think that's a terrible story to tell to flying men. Well, all I can say is I'm glad we're going in a liberator and not a Dakota. - But we are going in a Dakota. - But... I only heard myself just before dinner. We're going on in the same Dakota. You're joking, surely. Well, I wouldn't worry if I were you, Lindsay. After all, you did say there were eight passengers. Yes. Well, anyway, we won't have an important civilian or a girl on board. Will it be takeoff the same time tomorrow, sir? Yes, 10:00. Well, I must be going. Please don't move. - Goodbye, Mrs. robertson. - You must come and see us again. - Will you be here for some time? - Oh, yes, I think so. Thank you for a very nice evening. - Good night. - Come along, John. - We"ll see him off. - Right. - Good night. - Good night. Get the flight lieutenant a drink, dear. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm rather tired. I think I'll say good night too. - Yes, of course, I... - No, please, do stay and have your drink. - Good night, darling. - Good night, mother. - Good night, Mrs. robertson. - Good night. What a nice man he is. - Who? - The air marshal. Oh, yes, he's all right. It must be interesting being his personal assistant. In a way. And you like it? Oh, yes, it's interesting, but other chaps, you know, they... They think you've wangled a cushy job for yourself. They don't give you a dfc for a cushy job. Oh, I got that long ago, 1940. Battle of britain. Yes, I'd have been a squadron leader by now if the air marshal hadn't pulled me out to be his pa. But it was a great compliment, wasn't it? You might call it that, but it, uh, put the lid on what I hoped to do. Have you been over here long? I was born here. Daddy's been in Hong Kong for ages. I was at school in england when the jap war started. Mommy and daddy were interned. I didn't see them for nearly five years. Did they have a bad time? Mm, I think so. Thanks. Here's to happy days in good old england. Here's to you, Robbie. You know, I often wondered, after all you've been through, why... why you came back here at all. Best way to make up for lost time. You're still a young man, you've got plenty of time. Oh, if I were to step up now, it would mean another five good years. Might get to be a governor. Stranger things have happened. Yes, I'd like to see you as a governor. If I don't, then I go back to england next year, just one more civil servant who didn't get quite as far as he thought he should. - Come in. - Excuse me. Is there anything else for tonight, sir? No, I don't think so. I've checked with the airport. Everything's okay. All right, thanks. Good night, Mac. Good night, sir. - Good night. - Good night. That young man seems to have a good opinion of himself. - Does he get on your nerves? - Not when you get to know him. Mac was one of the best fighter pilots in the battle of britain. And then, quite suddenly... Well, it was the way things happened in those days. Complete breakdown. He got better, of course, in a manner of speaking, but there was no more fighting for him. But he still flies. Only as a passenger, never as a pilot. He's a braver man than I am. I'd sooner walk for a week than fly for an hour. You don't mean to say you've never flown. Please don't breathe it outside this room. I've never flown in my life. The governor's on the phone, daddy, will you take it in here? Ah, yes, thank you, my dear. What's the governor want at this hour of the night? Hello? Good evening, your excellency. Yes, yes, he's here with me now. Just a moment. It's for you, John. He's got lord Wainwright with him. Wainwright? Oh, that's wonderful. - Hello? - Good evening. Yes, he flew in this morning from Singapore. He's on his way to Tokyo for the trade conference. Now, as you're flying there yourself tomorrow, he's wondering whether he could keep you company. Yes, of course, that's splendid. Well, he's here now. Just a moment. He'd like a word with you. Thank you. Hello, John! How are you? I'm fine, thanks. Haven't seen you for ages. It's a bit of luck catching you here. Well, it'll be good to see you and hear the news. What time are you leaving? - 10:00, is that all right? - That'll suit me. Oh, splendid. Well, I'll pick you up about 9:30. - Good night, bertie. - Good night, John. Fancy old bertie Wainwright turning up here. We used to be at school together. He was the most awful ass in those days. He's a big shot now though. What is his job exactly? He's practically my boss. Advisor on eastern affairs to the foreign office. Well, I must try and put in a good word for you. I'm just one of a crowd to him. I don't suppose he's ever heard of me. You know, it's funny. That dream Lindsay told us about this evening. He said there was a very important civilian in the aircraft. Oh, yes, so he did. Well, here he is. Wainwright. I suppose if I were a chinaman, I should take that as an omen. Oh, if you were Chinese, you'd take it for granted. He expects his dreams to come true. Of course, if you use enough imagination and put things together, you can always make a dream look as if it comes true. It's a lot of bunkum. It's always puzzled me why an extremely intelligent people like the Chinese retain their medieval ideas about dreams and omens and suchlike. I shouldn't worry if I were you, John. - I'm not worried! - Will you have another drink? No, thanks. I think I'll turn in. What time do you have breakfast? Any time after 7, is that okay? Perfect, thanks. Well, I have enjoyed this little stay, Robbie. I wish it could've been longer. Yes, if you could've stayed a few more days, we could've had some golf. Oh, dear. We don't usually get calls this time of night. Well, it may be Wainwright about something. More likely a wrong number. It's a terrible exchange. Hello? Yes, that's right. - It's the governor again. - Oh. Yes, robertson speaking. Oh, that's all right, sir, I was only just going up. Are you there, robertson? Is it all right? Yes, sir, it's... it's all right. Good. Is the air marshal there? Yes, he's right here. The governor wants to speak to you. What's the trouble? Hello? I'm sorry to have to bother you again, but Wainwright's very keen to have robertson with him in Tokyo. It's a question of Japanese law. Now, he'll also need a good stenographer. I've suggested miss Campbell. Robertson knows her work. That means there'll be four, counting Wainwright's private secretary. Can you cope with that number? Yes, of course, no trouble at all. I'm afraid I shall be unable to see you off, so I wish you bon voyage now. Glad to understand. Thank you sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Well, that's that. Did he tell you that I was wanted? Yes, isn't that splendid? What's the matter? Oh, Robbie, I'm sorry, I was forgetting you've never flown. No, it's not that, it's, um... This other thing. It's uncanny. The dream, is that what's worrying you? It's just an odd coincidence. Coincidences are happening to us every day of our lives. Not to me, they're not. Listen, Robbie, you must be sensible. You can't seriously suggest that I should ask lord Wainwright to travel in a different plane than mine simply because some fellow had a dream. - No. - If we changed our plans every time somebody had a dream, things would soon be in chaos. Besides, Lindsay said there were eight passengers in that confounded dream of his, and we're only six. So it doesn't make sense anyway. Hello there! Good morning! I say, it's the most extraordinary thing. - Do you know what's happened? - What? We've got our important person, lord Wainwright, and a girl, just what the commander saw. My dear boy, millions of people dream dreams every night. - Yes, but if it did happen... - If it did happen, then there's no such thing as reality. I've been studying these oriental superstitions for years. The more I've learned, the more ridiculous and childish it becomes. Take my advice and forget it. Has lord Wainwright arrived? Not yet. We expect him at any moment. Excuse me, sir. Pardon the Liberty, sir, but are you one of the officers flying in that Dakota over there, sir? - Yes. - Well, they say you're stopping at okinawa. Yes, I believe we are. Well, me and my mate here, we've been on three days' leave from okinawa. We're with the reme unit attached to the yanks. Well, we were due to leave early this morning, sir. Well, sir, we missed the bus, like, and now we want to get back. No, no, McKenzie, certainly not, it's quite impossible. You'll have to see the authorities and wait. Well, sir, I only thought that... No, I'm afraid it's entirely out of the question. Yeah, what did I tell ya? Blinkin' civilians. Never was no good. You're right there, pal. Give me the service bloke every time. - Yeah. - When a man like lord Wainwright is on a confidential mission, is it usual to pick up every Tom, dick, and Harry who wants a lift? That isn't what was worrying you. If we'd been eight and they'd have made us ten, you'd have paid them to come. You might care to know that I've written a book which proves the absurdity of superstition. - Good morning, miss Campbell. - Good morning. Good morning. How do you do? Mr. robertson, I'm sorry you didn't want me to come with you. Oh, I didn't mean that. They told me you rang the office this morning suggesting that one of the men went in my place. Well, I just thought that, um... A long journey by air and an arduous conference to follow, the strain might've been too much for you. It was kind of you to think of it that way, but I'm certain I shall be all right. It was no reflection on your ability, I assure you. I'm glad it wasn't that. I begged them to let me come. I haven't been to a big conference before, and it's tremendously exciting. Excuse me. Well, here they come. Will you excuse me? - I must go and meet them. - Yes, of course. Mr. robertson, lord Wainwright has arrived. Oh. Thank you. Ah, Robbie. This is Mr. robertson. - Good morning. - How do you do, sir? I'm sorry to have done this to you at such short notice. Not at all, sir. Delighted to be of service. It's lucky to have found you here. I must confess, I don't speak a word of Japanese. If it weren't for you, I should've walked in on this conference and made a fool of myself. You wouldn't have done that, sir. You're an expert in these matters. Well, there are two kinds of experts in the world: The ones who have learned from books, like myself, and the ones who learn from experience, like you. Too many of my kind and not enough of yours. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Oh, um, come and meet lord Wainwright. Bertie, this is the captain of our aircraft, - squadron leader Walker. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - What sort of forecast have you? - Favorable, sir. - Good. Oh, there's just one thing. We haven't the range to make Tokyo in one hop. We'll refuel at okinawa. We shan't be in okinawa until about 5:00, and then there's an hour's refueling. That means a night journey on to Tokyo. Look, I was wondering, if you'd prefer it, we could sleep the night in okinawa and then take a daylight trip along the Japanese mainland in the morning. - That's an excellent idea. - Right, then I'll fix it. Oh, Mac, will you send a signal to okinawa and reserve accommodation for tonight? Very good, sir. Excuse me, sir. Just one more thing. What's that? There are a couple of soldiers outside who want a lift back to okinawa. It appears they missed their bus back. John, I can't imagine why these two men should persist in this way. They spoke to me outside. I made it quite clear to them that it was impossible for them to travel back on this aircraft. They're a decent enough couple of fellows. They wouldn't be any bother, sir. But lord Wainwright is certain to want to discuss important matters during the flight. Thank you, robertson, but personally, I wouldn't dream of refusing them on my account. If these men are due back at their unit, I see no reason why my presence should stop them. - Will there be enough room? - There's room for 12, sir. How many should we be, eight? Well, I see no reason... No logical reason. Shall I tell them, sir? - Yes. - Right. Let us know when you're ready to go. Quite soon now, sir. - About ten minutes. - Right. Well, we should be sitting down for a long while. - Shall we have a stroll outside? - Why not? Brandy, please. A large one. Yes, sir. Thank you. Of all the things, have you heard what's happened? Those blighters have pulled it off and got a lift to okinawa. So we're eight after all. Seven men and a girl. Full steam ahead for the dream. I say, sir, you're not fit for this, you shouldn't come. They'll find someone to take your place in Tokyo. You're implying that I'm afraid. - I never said that. - That's what you meant. No, really, I... And are you the sort of man who can accuse another of... I'm sorry. Will you have a drink with me? Mm-hmm. I'll have a beer. I don't pretend to be a brave man. I hate flying. But I've got a job to do, and I'm going to do it, no matter what anybody dreams. I have an idea you're a darn sight braver than I am. Well, here's to a good trip and a happy landing, even if the dream is complete, right down to the girl herself. And who's been dreaming about me? It's the most extraordinary thing, we've just been ta... What's extraordinary? Well, nothing. You said the dream was complete, including me. That's the extraordinary thing. And because of me, you didn't have a safe landing. - No, I never said that. - L1 heard you say, "here's to a safe landing, even if the dream's complete, right down to the girl herself." I assure you, miss Campbell, it's nothing. Absolutely nothing. Look, I'll tell you all about it when we get to okinawa, hmm? What difference does it make? Why not tell me now? Because I like being mysterious, that's why. - Oh, excuse me, gentlemen. - Yes? Are you passengers on the Dakota for Tokyo? Yes, we are. Well, we're ready for departure, sir. Thank you, we'll come right away. Hello, Robbie. I think you'll find this seat the most comfortable, sir. Thank you. You'll have a nice view of the harbor and the coastal towns from here. Do we follow the coast for long? For about half an hour, sir, and then we make for formosa. I think if Mr. robertson could sit here with me... Oh, certainly, sir. Then we can go through my notes for the conference. Will you fasten your safety belts, please, gentlemen? No smoking till after takeoff. Is that special military protection? I'd hardly call them protection. Can I take off, skipper? Sorry, Reggie, this is a tricky airfield. I'd better do it myself. I looked over these notes last night. They'll give you a rough idea of the ground we've got to cover. Oh, I'll read them over, sir. Let me know what you think the Japanese point of view would be on, uh, these clauses, three and four. Three and four. Tower from raf air 632. Permission to change frequency to approach control, over. Listen, bertie. You sit here, John. Oh, thank you, Robbie. Look, I've been glancing at this map. When we leave okinawa, it wouldn't take us much out of our way if we passed over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oh, yes, that'd be interesting. Have you flown over there before? No, that's what made me suggest it. Look, this is roughly where we are now, um, yeah, about here. You know you've made me awfully curious. Why won't you tell me what this mystery is? I'll tell you all about it when we get rid of those two soldiers at okinawa. What have they got to do with it? Everything. Yeah, my woman will have something to show around when she gets my letter saying I've traveled with all these nobs. There's only a couple of nobs. The others have been thrown in just to make it look important. Well, all the same. If I'd known I was gonna travel with lord what's-his-name, I'd have cleaned my cap badge. Yeah. Okay, Reggie, you can take over now. I'll drop back for a bit and ease my legs. Thanks a lot. Oh, Kent, did you pick up my book this morning? Yes, sir. - Thank you. - May 1? Well, excuse me. Well, sir, how's the trip? Fine. Are we on schedule? Yes, sir, so far as per the flight plan. There'll be coffee and a shack coming around a moment or two, sir. That will be very acceptable. Well, you seem to have made a good impression on the great man. - You think so? - Well, I'm sure of it. I said last night that I'd put in a good word for you. I don't think you need it now. If only one could feel easy in one's mind. You're not still worrying about that dream, are you? I know it's absurd, but I didn't sleep a wink last night. - Oh, neither did I. - You didn't? Well, you know the story of the old lady when they asked her if she believed in ghosts, and she said, "no, of course I don't, but I'm still frightened of them." Well, I think that applies to anything supernatural. You don't honestly think that a thing like that could happen just because somebody dreams it? Well, if I said it couldn't, I should begin to think that it was going to at any moment. No, I'd rather say to myself it might, then somehow I don't think it will. There's a good deal of interference, skipper. Seems like an electric storm somewhere ahead. What do they report in okinawa? A certain amount of low cloud, just like sea mist building up. It's funny, isn't it? You on your way home, your last flight; me, perhaps on the edge of something I've prayed for all my life. Here we are, this absurd, ridiculous thing hanging like some great black curtain between us and what we want so much. Well, you'll enjoy it all the more when you get through the black curtain. Then you think we shall? Well, now, Robbie, don't start that again. - Coffee, sir? - Thank you. - Ham sandwich? - No, not for me, thank you. - Coffee, sir? - Thank you. - Sandwich? - No, thank you. Shift it. Coffee, sir? Ah, yes, thanks. I'd almost forgotten where I was. These thrillers, extraordinarily ingenious. They just found a dead man disguised as a scarecrow, been standing in the field for six weeks with a laborer hanging a coat on his outstretched arms. You'd have thought by that time, they'd have begun to notice something. You won't feel like a ham sandwich then, sir? No, thank you. Well, we shouldn't be long now. How are you feeling? I'll be very thankful for a good night's sleep. Well, you'll get that in an hour or so when we touch down. Or maybe less. Would you care to sit here, sir? Oh, thank you, Mac. Well, I don't see why he should have all the fun. Thank you, Mac. Oi, it's a ruddy great storm over there. I wonder what it's like going through a storm like that. You won't have to wonder much longer. Wait till we catch up with the rsm. Blimey, what a storm. Alter course 20 degrees to port. We'll try and miss that stuff. Okay. There's no guarantee we'll miss it there either. No, but we've a better chance than flying straight for it, haven't we? Excuse me. I was wondering just now, I can't understand why Lindsay should've told you about that dream last night. Well, why shouldn't he? It seems peculiar for a man suddenly to describe a dream for no reason. What gave rise to it, what led up to it? Oh, I don't know. He yawned, said he was sleepy, and said he hoped he'd have a better night than last night, and... that led him into the dream. If he hadn't told you, we should be enjoying this flight without a care in the world. It wouldn't have altered the risk, would it? I really don't know. It's an interesting theory, isn't it? Perhaps nothing happens in this world unless somebody dreams about it first. This dream that we're mixed up in, did Lindsay tell you any more about it than he told us? Yes, he did, as a matter of fact. What? Nothing much. Well, what was it? Well, he described the passengers a bit more clearly. There were eight of them. One was a coarse, flashy type with a loud voice. Well, that doesn't fit very well, does it? None of us is coarse or flashy, and the... The soldiers are very quiet. Was there anything else? What else was there? Why talk about it? Why not tell me? There's no need to treat me like a child. Whatever he said, I'd like you to tell me. If you must know, it was pretty awful at the end. Just before the crash, one of the passengers went crazy, mad with fright. The other passengers had to hold him down. He lost all control of himself. Well, naturally, Lindsay didn't tell you that part in front of your wife and daughter. Would you fasten your safety belts, please? There's nothing to worry about. We're running into a patch of storm. You were right, Reggie, we didn't miss it. Uh-uh, here it is. Will you fasten your safety belt, please, sir? What a story to tell the missus! Yeah. Have you earthed your set? Of course I have, skipper. Put the lights on in the passengers' cabin? - Yes, captain. - Pulled the blinds? No, I'll go and do that now. How... how much longer will we be? We should touch down any minute now, sir. Ah, thank god. Raf air 632 from okinawa tower. You are turn one for landing. Runway 0-3, wind 0-4-5 degrees, boy, I'll bet that's one limey who'll be glad to see us. Tower from raf air 632. On final approach, over. Raf air 632 from tower, you are clear to land. Not a bad landing for a night like this! Yeah. For me, I'd sooner talk 'em down than bring 'em down. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Sir. Sorry you had to fly through one of those bad storms of ours. It was disturbing while it lasted, but after all, these things are interesting, you know, I thoroughly enjoyed the journey! Quite sorry it's over! - Be with you in a moment. - All right. Well, boys, I hope you enjoyed the trip. Well, all except the storm, sir. Yes, that was far from pleasant. I hope it didn't shake you up too much. That's all right, we'll get over it. Good. Perhaps you'll give me the pleasure of buying you a drink, hmm? Where do you think you're going? Now, don't let me interfere. Take your time. The army can wait. Right, shut! About turn! Forward march! Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. What did you say, service blokes are better than civvies? - Give me civvies every time. - Right wheel! You know, Robbie, you should never play poker. You haven't got the face for it. You're quite right. It's just a relief after that nightmare journey. Ah, here's the crew. - Hello, Mac. - Hello. I guess it was amazing. You see, it all fitted together, right down to you. One girl, he said, and seven men. Well, that was all right at first because we were only six, and then at the last minute, I'm blessed if those two soldiers didn't turn up to make us eight. I'm glad you didn't tell me. Well, Robbie, I think I'll go and have a wash and brush up before dinner. I've been, uh, I've been telling her all about it. Have you? It's a funny business, wasn't it? Funny? I think it was horrible. Well the details weren't exactly like the dream, you know. The naval commander didn't mention the two private soldiers; They were all civilians except for the air marshal and McKenzie here, and then he spoke to you about a coarse, flashy man with a loud voice, didn't he? Mm-hmm. - Air marshal hardie? - Yes. I want to ask you a favor. Now, my name's Bennett, Walter Bennett. I'm the managing director of the anglo pacific trading co. Perhaps you've heard of me. - Here's my card. - Well, what can I do for you? Well, it's like this. I hold a government warrant to deal in war surplus. I have all my papers here if you'd like to see them. No, that's quite all right. What can I do? Well, I'm on a big tour of these eastern military establishments buying up stuff that, uh, isn't wanted, and me and my secretary, that's the little bloke over there, we got off here a couple of days ago to do a job, and I have a very big deal to put over in Tokyo tomorrow night. - Yes? - Well, there isn't another plane going through here until Wednesday, so seeing as you've got plenty of room on that Dakota of yours, I was thinking that you'd be a decent chap and, uh, give us a lift in the morning. Very sorry, I'm afraid it can't be done. Well, why not? I mean, there's only the two of us, and I've just been told that two fellas got off here to stay, so you won't be any more than you were, will you? That's not the point, it's an entirely different matter. I'm very sorry, but you'll have to wait for another aircraft. Are you on this Dakota? - Yes. - How many does it take? - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Passengers. About a dozen I suppose. Why? And, uh, there's six of you. - That's right, isn't it? - Well, what about it? Well, what's the matter with that air marshal of yours, eh? Nothing as far as I know. Listen, me and my secretary have got to be in Tokyo tomorrow. Now, there isn't another aircraft until Wednesday. I ask him politely for a lift, and he pretty well hits me in the face. Well, if he says you can't, then you can't, can you? Look, everybody helps everybody else these days. I mean, can't you make him see some common sense”? I'm ready to pay, and pay well too. It isn't a matter of money. If you had all the money in the world, you couldn't buy yourself a place on an aircraft on a special mission. Look, I'm on a special mission! And you'll have to get there some other way, won't you? Shall we go and get ready for dinner? Well, I think this is where I go to bed. It's been a long day for an old man. I should be going along presently. What time do you want to get to Tokyo tomorrow? Any time before dark. We don't begin our talks till the following morning. Well, we should need six hours if we're going by Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I think we should leave at 10 in the morning. That's a nice, comfortable time. Then I'll see you at breakfast. Good night, John. Good night, bertie. McKenzie, just a minute. I'm going to my room now. We shall get away at 10 in the morning. - Very good, sir. - Send a signal through to Tokyo first thing tomorrow, tell them we're making this diversion over Nagasaki and Hiroshima. - We should be in Tokyo about 4. - Right, sir. - Good night, Mac. - Good night, sir. Excuse me a minute, uh, it's about this business of mine in Tokyo. Now, I'm very sorry if I offended you this evening... No, no, there's no offense at all, it's just that I couldn't help, that's... oh, thank you very much. Well, uh, perhaps I don't explain things very well. You see, I'm not traveling around picking up big profits for myself, it's more than that. It's something big for the country that I'm going to pull off in Tokyo. No, that's all right, you keep it. - No, please, they're yours. - Oh, thank you. Well, as I was saying, now, this trade conference that lord Wainwright's going to, all the big jap businessmen are going to be there and the Americans too. Now, why leave all the best stuff for the yanks? I mean, it's a great chance for us British to pull off something really worth having for the old country. Well, if you're traveling officially, surely the British government made accommodation for you. They did, they did, I got all my papers fixed up by the department of overseas trade. Now, here they are, you're quite welcome to have a look at them. No, I'm quite sure they're all right. You see, they leave me to fix my own traveling arrangements because I never know how long these jobs are going to take, but I've never had any difficulty before. Whenever there was a plane available, I've been made very welcome, everywhere. Now, if you was to speak to lord Wainwright, he's all out for British trade. Surely if there's room on that Dakota of yours, you're not going to leave me behind here to lose the biggest deal that britain's had since the war. - I shall have to consider it. - But you, uh, you will talk to lord Wainwright? Well, I may. Oh, that's fine. That's fine! Well, it's all okay. I'm with you in the morning. Drinks on me, what're you gonna have, eh? What do you mean, you're with us in the morning? Me and my secretary, flying with you to Tokyo in the morning. But didn't you hear what the air marshal said? - He can't arrange it. - He saw common sense when he knew it was important. He's just given me the okay out there on the balcony. Well, come on, what're you gonna have, eh? Well, you're a couple of fine traveling companions, you are. - Who is that chap? - Did you know he got a passage on the Dakota tomorrow with his secretary? First I've heard of it. Who fixed him up? He said the air marshal's given him permission. Oh, well, there's plenty of room. We often pick up people these days. But this is terrifying. It's frightening. That means there'll be eight of us again, just like the dream said. - What dream? - Oh, don't you know? It's most uncanny. There was a man in Hong Kong who had an extraordinary dream... You've had a little too much. It's time you cooled off a bit. You'd better come outside. But Mac, I've hardly had anything! It's such a weird, uncanny thing, it gives you the creeps. First of all, he dreamt there was a Dakota, there were eight passengers, one of them was the air marshal, another was a very important person, - and everything... - Will you please stop it! Oh, dear. I think he's the one that's had too much. Excuse me. Did you see all that? No, what was it? All about some mysterious dream. Do you know anything about it? Do you believe in these things yourself? I don't believe in anything till I know what it is. I thought he would've laughed at it, like you did. You don't seriously believe these things, do you? Don't you? No, not really. It always seems to me that if something evil is foreseen, then we say it's fate and there's nothing we can do about it, but if it's good, then we can take the credit for ourselves. I'm a skeptic, I'm afraid. I suppose being interned has made me think like that. Internment doesn't seem to have done the same for Mr. robertson, he believes all right. Does he? Why, yes of course. That's why he didn't want me to come on this trip. Poor Mr. robertson. And I was so cross with him. You didn't answer my question, did you? Do I believe in premonitions, is that it? - Mm-hmm. - I don't know. I don't think so. But I'm certain one should never put such things into the mind of a pilot, it's asking for trouble. Well, when you had a long spell overtired, you know, you often dream. I remember once dreaming I was over London in a fog with the petrol running out. A few days later, there I was, over northolt - in a dense fog. - With no petrol? Oh, plenty of that, they sent me off to a clear airfield - about 50 miles away. - Then it wasn't like your dream. - It never is, exactly. - This one is. We haven't crashed yet, you're expecting too much for your money. Look, if you feel badly about it, there's something you can do to alter the setup. How can I? It's this business of the eight passengers that upsets you, isn't it? Well, the air marshal is the one to decide, you better see him about it. Oh, no, I couldn't do... Excuse me, could you tell me where I can find - air marshal hardie? - Sir, end room on the right. Thank you. Come in. - Oh, hello, Robbie. - May I have a word with you? Well, yes, of course, what's the trouble? That man Bennett and his friend, you mustn't let them come with us tomorrow. - My dear Robbie. - You're mad, John, you're deliberately gambling with people's lives. You know, you're letting this thing get on your nerves and... There's something happening here that none of us understands. One of the men that Lindsay saw in his dream was Bennett. Nonsense, I don't suppose Lindsay ever saw Bennett in his life. How could he have dreamt that he was in the aircraft? McKenzie told me he did. He saw Bennett here and decided to fit him into his dream. McKenzie's very highly strung and imaginative. He told me before he saw Bennett. He told me in the aircraft before we got here. He described him exactly as Lindsay described him and it was Bennett. Now look, Robbie, you're tired, you must go to bed and forget all this rubbish. Is this your idea of leadership? To lead these people to certain death? If you want to behave like a child frightened of the dark, then... Well you're the one that ought to stay behind. I'm thinking of the others as much as I am of myself. Well, leave me to think about them, it's my responsibility who flies in this aircraft. You realize that every detail has come true, that only one remains and that that one will come true as sure as fate unless you stop it now. I shall do what I consider right. And then you'll be the only lucky one, because you won't be alive to know the appalling thing you've done. What on earth was all that about? - It was robertson. - Yes, I saw him, what happened? Well, he's upset because he's overwrought. - Why? - Well, it's an absurd, fantastic thing. But... No, I don't want to worry you about it. Sounded very violent, isn't it something I ought to know? You're not seriously concerned, John? Are you? Well, I don't know, bertie, maybe events can be foreseen. Certainly there's no effect without cause. And the cause may be happening now? Something like that. Are you suggesting that we don't take these... What do you believe, John? If we left these men behind, we should be putting ourselves back 1,000 years, to the days when men were slaves to witchcraft and black magic. We can't do that sort of thing in the middle - of the 20th century, John. - No, I don't suppose we can. We must brush these primitive things aside and behave like intelligent, common sense men in the age of reason. All the same, I wish this fellow Bennett were at the bottom of a coal mine, - I shan't sleep a wink tonight. - Nor shall I. Well, if you don't, then come in and we'll have a game of gin rummy. Thank you. - Morning, George. - Good morning, sir. Did you sleep well? Wonderful. That's the best night sleep I've had for years. - It's a lovely day, isn't it? - Yeah. If I'd brought my bathing drawers, you know I'd have gone down for a dip. They say the sea's very dangerous around here. - Sharks. - Sharks? I'd love to see the shark that could get the better of me. Uh, two fried eggs and a lot of bacon, please. Good morning, my lord. - Morning. - Sleep well? - Yes, thank you. - Lovely day. It's very pleasant, very pleasant indeed. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning, John. - Morning, bertie. Well, you didn't come in to play gin rummy. No, I went straight off, I slept like a log, did you? Fairly, quite fairly, I had a dream. - Oh, a good one, I hope. - Blessed if I know, I can't - remember a thing about it now. - Morning, sir. - Oh, good morning, Mac. - Good morning, sir. - Everything fixed up? - Everything's all right, sir. And what's the weather forecast? We're fine all the way, sir. Oh, good, uh... Have you seen Mr. robertson this morning? Yes, I haven't seen him since last night. Well, I think you better go and give him a knock, it's past nine, if he wants any breakfast he'll have to hurry. Right, sir. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, all set? All ready, sir, there's a bit of a headwind. If we're going by Hiroshima, Nagasaki, we ought to get moving. - Right, we're all ready I think. - Very good, sir. Did you give Mr. robertson a call? Why yes, sir, I told him breakfast is ready. - Did you see him? - No, I just knocked. He answered. Did he sound all right? Well, I think so, sir, he just said thank you, that's all. Shall I go and find him, sir? No, don't worry, I'll go myself. Hello, Robbie, I was just coming to find you. I'm so sorry, have I kept you waiting? No, we're just about ready, that's all. - Did you get some breakfast? - They brought me some coffee. - You're all right, aren't you? - Yes, quite. I don't as a rule have much breakfast. They told me there was an aircraft flying through to Hong Kong this morning. I took the opportunity of writing a line to my wife. - Have a nice trip, sir. - Thanks. You see, we shall hardly be out of sight of land from now on. This whole group of islands stretches right across - to the Japanese mainland. - Uh, what's that little place - down there, then? - Uh, there, tokuno island. Now, what would they do on a place like that? I haven't the faintest idea. Look, we shall alter course presently, a little bit to the north, there's Nagasaki. Nagasaki, that's where they dropped the atom bomb, isn't it? - That's right, and here... - But that's miles - off our way to Tokyo. - Oh, quite a bit. Well, what's the point? Well, the point is that we want to see Nagasaki and Hiroshima. But that will make us late getting to Tokyo, won't it? Oh, we should be there about 5:00, it will only add two hours to our journey. Are you having a successful business trip, Mr. Bennett? Well, pretty good, my lord, I can't complain. You know, if I pull off this deal, I'll make myself a packet. Of course, it will do the old country a bit of good as well, you know? I've had a very hard life, you know, things haven't always worked out my way. If I pull this one off, I shall retire and I'll get myself a suite in one of those posh London hotels and a yacht in the mediterranean and a nice country mansion, 'cause I'm a home-loving sort of chap, you know? “Yes. I don't fly around the world for fun. There's not much doubt in his mind, is there? No, I almost envy him his confidence. Oh, I don't know. Anyone with sense has doubts. It's being able to overcome them yes, ll... I suppose you're right. Tired? - Hmm, bit of a head. - Whiff of oxygen, - that's what you want. - Oxygen? I haven't got pneumonia. Well, it's wonderful for a headache. Look, you stay here, I'll go along to the control cabin and see if they can fix you up. Miss Campbell's got a bit of a hangover, too many cocktails last night. Can you let her to have a whiff of oxygen? - Haven't got any. - No oxygen? No reason to go above 10,000 feet. - Well, that's too bad. - I'll fix her up with a cup - of coffee, she'll be all right. - Tell the air marshal we'll be over Nagasaki in 20 minutes. - Okay. How are things going? - A bit hazy. Probably clear when we get to the mainland. Thanks. Sorry, no oxygen, try this coffee. - Oh, thanks. - Like an aspirin? No thank you, what happened to the oxygen? Have all the crew got hangovers? Oh, no, they don't carry it on this route, they don't need it. The captain reports we'll be over Nagasaki in 20 minutes, sir. Well, I hope it will be clearer than this. Will you ask the air marshal if he'd mind coming along? Right, skipper. Captain says would you mind coming up front please, sir? Uh, sorry, sir, Nagasaki's right down there below us. - What's our altitude? - 6,000, sir. - Could we drop down? - I think we'll find this stuff - right down to the deck, sir. - That's bad luck. Lord Wainwright rather wanted to see Nagasaki. Well, we could play around for a bit, sir, if you'd like? It may clear. No, I wouldn't do that. Better set course for Hiroshima, may be clear there. Um, what's the distance? 160 miles, sir, matter of an hour and ten minutes. All right, well, go ahead and do that. Just connected with Tokyo. What's it like over there? They've got a lot of low cloud but the front appears to be moving. Where are we? Should be about halfway across this inland sea. I reckon we're about 70 miles southwest of Hiroshima. Uh-oh, looks like Hiroshima's out too. We can't risk going any lower. There's some pretty high land on kyushu, it rises to about 4,000 feet in places. - Why not climb above it? - Could do. - Shall I have a go? - All right. Seven thousand feet, skipper. Looks like it's clearing. Good. Oh, isn't it lovely? - It's just like Switzerland. - Yes. Will you excuse me a moment? One sometimes gets the idea that one could land on top of those clouds, go for a walk on them. I'm afraid you'd get your feet wet. Besides, walk on the clouds wasn't in that dream. No. I was thinking about that just now. Does a thing like that have to worry the pilot? - Does he mind it? - Oh, no, it's all in a day's work. Even so, I wouldn't breathe a word to the captain of an aircraft about things like that dream. But surely, it wouldn't worry a man like that? It's curious, but it can. If a pilot gets the conviction that he isn't going to survive, gradually, the strain turns it into an obsession. Then one day, a crisis comes along, something maybe that he could get out of without much difficulty, but he says to himself, "ah, this is it." He accepts the inevitable and goes down without any attempt to survive. Well, that's why we don't talk about omens or bad dreams in the air force. They're the worst poison a flying man can swallow. It's gone, packed up. What's the trouble? Power supply has failed, skipper. Can you do anything about it? Well, not till we get to Tokyo. I think it's burned out. What's the trouble? Nothing. The engineer spilled the coffee. I think perhaps you should know, sir, that the radio is packed in. Hiroshima doesn't look too hopeful, does it? No, I'm afraid not. You better tell the air marshal it looks as if we're out of luck with Hiroshima and I'm heading direct for Tokyo. Right. Message from the pilot, sir, there's no sign of a break and we've just passed Hiroshima, so he's set course for Tokyo. Well, thank goodness for that. I thought we'd get that, sir, there was a high bank of cloud right ahead. Better get those old belts on. It's all right, we'll soon climb above it. This is bad, sir, it's coming in from the east. What's you altitude now? - 9,000, sir. - No oxygen? - Never needed it up till now. - Yes, I know that, but it's a bit rough on the passengers. That depends on the passengers. Um, not that I know of. Lord Wainwright isn't a young man but he looks pretty fit, I don't know about the two new ones. I didn't like the look of Bennett much, sir. Oh, well, we'll just have to chance that. What do you think, um, try and climb above this? I think so, sir. It's all right, we'll soon be out in the sun again. But we're going high, the air will be a bit thin so sit quiet and breathe steadily. Fourteen thousand. They aren't going to enjoy this back there. Maybe it's clear below. I wouldn't want to go down through this now. We're beginning to ice up. It's this... Blasted bronchitis. What's that? We're collecting ice. I don't think we can go much higher. So long as that ice keeps flying off, we're all right. These aircraft are built for just that. Oh, I can't stand this. It's all right for you, I got a chest. Bronchitis. I'm... I'm choking. Take it easy, it's no good fighting it. I cannot take it easy. I can't breathe. You wait, I'll report this. Now be quiet, it's the same for all of us. It's all that mucking about 'round nag... nag... We should be in Tokyo by now. I'm afraid, skipper, we'll have to go down. There's a fellow back there who'll pass out if we stay up here much longer. I had to climb, keep running into this stuff. Just on 19,000. Reggie, take over. Don't risk a blackout, Walker, it's easy for it to happen - without oxygen at this height. - Okay, sir. Well? We've flown 2 hours and 25 minutes since the radio passed out, sir. On dead reckoning, we should be over Tokyo. We're estimating for an easterly drift. Has there been any change in these cloud banks? Any sign of a break? None, sir, except they get higher. Each time we run into it, we start icing up worse, fight to hold altitude and keep clear of it. We'll have to risk it and go down. Tell them we're going down. - Stay in there with them. - Right, sir. We're going down, we... we may hit some bumps, I'm worried about this ice, sir. By the look of the passengers, I'd advise you to get down as quickly as possible. Yeah, that's just my trouble. To do that, I'll have to lower the undercart, probably use the flaps as well. Get as much drag as possible. Well, that will dry us up, won't they? Well, that's just it. And if it's freezing down to ground level we'll be in real trouble, never be able to control the plane. Okay to go ahead now, sir. We'll see how we go as we are. There's no use, we'll shake ourselves to bits at this rate. Lower the undercarriage. Give me quarter flap. Now. We'll try again. Well done, Walker. Let's hope it's not freezing down to ground level. Thirteen thousand. Still icing up badly. My ears, they're turning inside out. Mine too, hold your nose and blow, make them crack. Oh, my ears! Try swallowing, sir, it might ease you. Oh, shut up, can't you? What do you know about it anyway? Nine thousand. By my reckoning, we should come down somewhere southeast of Tokyo. I hope. Six thousand feet, and if we hit a mountain, we'll know you're wrong. We're coming out of it. It's the sea, I'm right. There's a ship. Where? There was a ship, over there starboard in the mist. There it is. Wireless operator, get your aldis lamp ready, give him a signal. If only I knew where the thing was. I'll take a circle 'round. Well, you chaps seem well able to cope with the situation, I'll go back and get out of your way. Thank goodness, it gives me the jitters to have brass hats breathing down my neck. We'll fly due west and pick up the coast. Well, it seems we've come down somewhere southeast of Yokohama bay. We should sight the coast soon. But no thanks to the maniacs driving this plane. What's that ahead? It is cloud? That's land all right, you don't get cloud that color. Look, you can see the surf. That's our first bit of luck today, we might've been heading to the middle of the pacific. - Shall I go tell them, skipper? - Hm? Yes, good idea, it will cheer them up. It's all right, sir, land ahead. Oh, I thought we should be overland all the way. So we should've been, sir, but up there above the clouds it's a bit difficult to allow for crosswinds. It's past 4:00. We'd been inboard now if we haven't mucked about. Here a minute. Look, I wired last night to some chaps telling them to meet me at the imperial hotel, Tokyo. Now, you might send a radio message saying I'll be there in half an hour and to book me two large rooms with bath. - I can't. - Why not? - No radio, it's broken down. - Well, I'll be. No radio, no oxygen. You'll be telling me next the ruddy plane - hasn't any wings. - But it hasn't. I'll turn due south down the coast until you can pick up a landmark, okay? Okay with me, skip. You better check the undercart and the flaps. Right. Undercart"s okay, skipper. That's a second bit of luck today. You can see the coastline quite clearly now, look. That's a sight for sore eyes. It really seemed as though that dream was coming true, - didn't you feel it? - I did. Yet all the time I kept saying to myself, storm, darkness, snow, as long as they didn't come, I felt we were all right. That's why I didn't tell you the radio had broken down. - You knew? - Mm-hm. I'm afraid I'd have died if I'd known that. How we are for fuel? About an hour and a half's flying, skipper. Do you see anything yet? Nothing to help so far. Think I'll go back for a smoke, skipper. All right. That's strange, skipper, we're heading due north now. Take over, Reggie. - We could be going up here. - Could be. Keep a sharp lookout, we gotta find our bearings soon. What time's it get dark in these parts? Just before five. About half an hour's time. - How are things? - Something down there, skipper! It's a small village. I still thought if we were over the east coast of Japan, we'd have passed over one of the large towns long before this. I'm making some coffee, sir, would you care for a cup? We might just as well wait till we get to the airport, - don't you think? - We may not be in just yet, sir. - Why, what's happened? - Well, it wasn't possible to follow an exact course under these bad flying conditions. So we're following the coast until we can establish our position. You mean, you don't know where we are? - I... I trust this is Japan? - It's Japan all right, sir. How do you know that, eh? Because it couldn't be anything else. Well, from what I've seen of your flying methods, it could be China or blackpool, for that matter. Now look, I'm in a hurry, I've got business to do. You're... you're sure we're following the coast - in the right direction? - Certain, sir. How long is it since we started to follow this coast? Just under 100 miles, sir. Well, these big town are only 50 miles apart, right along the coast. We ought to have seen one of them by now. There's some place coming up right now, sir. That's the place we passed some time ago. It couldn't be, sir, it's impossible. It's no good pretending. It's the same place. We must've flown completely around an island. There's only one big island off of Japan and that's off the northwest coast. Sado island, here. It would take about 100 miles to circle around it. - How much longer can we fly? - Not above half an hour, sir. Well, then Tokyo's impossible, that's 160 miles. Nearest town on the mainland is niigata about 40 miles, can we make that? If we're lucky, sir, we shall have a headwind. Well, there's an airstrip just inland from the town. Well, that's our best plan, do you agree? Set your course on that, straight across the island. Well, I better go and have a word with them back in there. 107 magnetic. Well, I expect you all want to know what's happened. Our radio failed soon after we climbed above these clouds this afternoon, we had to fly blind for three hours in the worst conditions. In fact, everything considered I think we're very lucky to have found the coast at all. But we're a long way to the northwest of Tokyo, and we shall have to land on the nearest airstrip on the mainland. But surely, John, isn't this the mainland? No, no, this is sado island, about 40 miles from the mainland. We're making straight for the mainland now. It's not a long crossing, only about 20 minutes. You'll see a town called niigata and the airstrip just beyond. It will be dark. Yes, I expect so, but we'll signal and they'll see us in. I'm sorry about all this, it's just one of those things. Something that nobody could've helped. Well, it can't be worse than it's been, I never mind once I know where I am. Why don't we land here and stop the night? Now, take a look for yourself. If you landed there you'd stop for more than a night. You'd stop till someone came and collected what was left of you in a sandbag. There's something coming up ahead. Did you say there were 40 miles of open sea? 32, to be exact. It looks like high cliffs. Couldn't be, it's not more than ten miles ahead. It looks to me more like a storm. Well, there's no good trying to dodge it, we'll have to go right through it. Those passengers in there, tell it's safety belts again. Right, skipper. Anyway, they'll need them soon for landing. Will you fix your safety belts please, we're preparing - for landing. - The air marshal said in about 20 minutes, must we wear them so soon? I think it's best, sir, we may go through a patch of rough weather in a moment. Getting very dark, isn't it, sounds barely safe. I think it's the storm, sir, it's right ahead. We're not more than 20 miles from the mainland now, though. They kept talking about the mainland. They were in very heavy cloud. It got darker and darker. We are going very fast, aren't we? It's the storm that's going fast, sir. Can't last much longer, not like that, that's a real hurricane. - Is that snow on the window? - Yes, sir, we get it like that sometimes around here. Storm, darkness, snow. This is it, isn't it? That's all rubbish. The dream said we were lost, and we're not lost. So the Chinese are right after all. Things are preordained. Maybe they are, maybe Lindsay was right, maybe everything is predestined. But to go through life believing that, it would be stupid, a mockery, a travesty of living. Look, Robbie, we've all been given a brain and a mind with which to shape our lives. We can't just accept what is to come and do nothing about it. It's our duty to life, to live it to the utmost. That's our duty to god. You can't just give in, that's too easy and just by saying, "if my number's on it, then I'm going to get it." Well, that's why it was so essential that the pilot shouldn't know anything about this dream. If he'd known about that, he'd... He does know. I told him. Cloud, darkness, snow. Got the lot now. Well, that's what he said, wasn't it, sir? - Cloud, darkness, and snow? - Now look, Walker, you've gotta stop thinking about all that now... Pull up, we're nearly in the seal! Pull up! Agh, that's what they are, bloody mad men! Turn around and take her back! - You're mad, the whole... - Now you sit down - and keep quiet! - Where's that pilot, let me get at him, he's not gonna murder me! Thank you, gentlemen, I think he'll be all right now if you'll go back to your seats. How's the fuel? I'd say we have only another 15 minutes left. Look out... cliffs! Storm, show, cliffs, and a beach. Port boost up. This is it, sir, I shall have to put her down on that beach. You can't do that, it will be suicide. You must not put her down there, it will be asking for disaster. Put her down in the sea, it's our only chance. Bring her down in the sea, I tell you! I'm sorry, sir. I'm in command of this plane, and I'm going to put her down on that beach. You're quite right, captain. Sorry. We couldn't be in better hands. - Engineer? - Sir? Okay, lads, you can all get back now, you know the drill. Good luck, skipper. Good luck, skipper. We're going to make an emergency landing but it's been done many times before, so there's no need for undue alarm. Uh, just tighten your straps and brace on to whatever you can. Right, you go in there. Right you are, go ahead. - All set in there, skipper. - Right. Here goes. Ask the air marshal to come forward, will you? The beach is too short for landing, sir. Thank god for that. I just noticed a valley full of snow, looks pretty flat, probably paddy fields. I'm gonna belly her down there. Right, Walker, we'll I'll go and see all is well behind. Make it snappy, sir, we haven't got much fuel left. Well, Reggie? No thanks, skipper, you can have this one. Good luck. Yes, yes it's excellent. What made me suggest searching up there? Well, it's our job to use our brains, you know? Thanks very much. Not at all. Bye. The governor's on the other phone, sir. The governor! Right, thanks. Good morning, your excellency. I hear it was you who suggested searching that remote area. It must be a wonderful thing to know that you've saved all those valuable lives. Well, I only did my duty, sir. Thank you very much, sir, goodbye. Commander Lindsay to see you, sir. Lindsay? Oh, yes, of course. - Right, show him in. - Yes, sir. Would you come in, sir? - Hello, commander. - Hello. - Well, this is great news. - Yes, it's good to know that it's turned out all right. I think some of the credit for this may to due to you. Oh, no, the credit's yours, not mine. It's good of you to put it like that. After all, I only described a scene, it was you that ordered the search of the northwest coast. Yes, that's true. Well, now that it's all over, will you tell me what made you describe it? - Do you really want to know? - Well, naturally. - I had a dream. - A dream? Yes, I dreamt the whole thing, and from what I hear it turned out exactly as I dreamt it, except for the last part. Do you often have dreams like that? Oh, yes, as a matter of fact I do. - It must be very disturbing. - Yes, it is rather. Only this afternoon, I'd dozed off in the lounge of the officers' club, - I had another dream. - What about? - You. - Me? - Yes. - What happened? Oh, it wouldn't be fair to tell you. I think I ought to know. No, I'd rather not, but, um... If you do disappear... I'll tell the authorities where to go and look for you.
