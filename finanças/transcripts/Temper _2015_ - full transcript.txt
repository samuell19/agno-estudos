Study. if you work hard and study, you will learn. - What if i work hard and buy? - What? i will pay money and buy degree. ,Finally i bought the degree by taking help from few people., ,Only physical test i passed genuinely., ,Finally, either because of my good luck or your bad luck..., ,...i became Sub-lnspector!, ,Jai Hind!, Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! - Hey! - Where will you run? Why are you standing there and watching? Come. Why did God give the sea? - For fishes? - isn't it? We go in boat to catch them. Anyway we go so we bring something in them. Why does police call it smuggling? Not only that... ...they are arresting our boys every now and then. That SI arrested my brother today. it will take five minutes to kill him. But they will bring another strict officer if he gets killed. i don't want that. Look, remove him and replace him with the SI who listens to me. He shouldn't have morality. He shouldn't know what honesty and sincerity. In short, he should be worse than me.

Listen to what he says. - Leave it, mom. - What should i listen to? i listened to you and agreed for this marriage. You said he is very good. Now see. Aunt, i am a good person. Hey, if you call me aunt again then i'll make you bite with dogs. Be careful! - Aunt. - No, sir.. You? You will not ruin your life by getting your daughter married to him, right? - You have clarity? - Absolutely. - You leave. - Sir, it is not that. - My fiancée, sir. - Leave! - Sanvi, i will call and tell you.. - What will you call? Sanvi, i will tell everything that happened. What will you convince here? i will kill you if you are seen near her. - Go! - Sir, it is not that. if you again stop or meet her, you will die. Anyway why do you get married to the person who beats dogs with stones? What? Does he beat dogs with stones? Yes! He wakes up the sleeping dog and beats it. My blood boils by watching his deeds. Do you like dogs so much? Like? i was born in the midst of dogs, i grew up with dogs... ...i worked in dogs, chemist. What do you think a dog is? Only dog loves us unconditionally. it loves human's more than fellow dogs. Leave all that. We even search for dogs in humans. Do you know? Dog like husband who obeys his husband... ...dog like wife who takes her husband's abuses. Dog like driver, dog like maid. Whether we are at home or not, dog like old woman like her who guards the house. These are not sufficient and so we bring another dog. Sanvi, humans don't need humanity. They need dog's behaviour. ,Dog's behaviour! Dog's behaviour!, Look, if i were to marry... ...i will become a dog to my wife... ...and i will turn my wife into a dog. Yes! i fell on the spot after watching you. i forgot myself on the spot. i fell on the spot after watching you. i forgot myself on the spot. Like some magic happened on the spot. i fell for your words on the spot. What have you done to me? i don't understand it at any cost. You killed me by pulling and pinching my heart.. you made me love you. One more time, baby, one more time. Tell the same word one more time. One more time, baby, one more time. Tell the same word one more time. One more time. On the spot. Yesterday Ceylon Subbarao came, so i asked him. He says there is only two hours difference is there between them and us. Grandmother, that was before Korea got split. Timings have changed after they got split. - So why did Subbarao tell me like that? - What does Ceylon Subbarao know? He went to Ceylon. i went to Korea. Tell him to meet me once. i will tell him Korea timings. Oh God! Why does he shout like this? Why doesn't he tell that slowly? You have hurt me with your eyes. You have gestured with lips and disturbed my sleep. My heart played swinging with you. Oh dear, i liked you in many ways. i fell on the spot after watching you. i forgot myself on the spot. Sir, for how many days should i come like this? i am shouting daily saying my daughter is missing. But no police is reacting. Who is Arun? Who is Arun? My daughter's friend. They study together. - Where he stays? - He stays at Gajuwaka. His house is behind Yellamma temple in Gajuwaka. He too is missing from the day your daughter is missing. Do you understand what happened? Your daughter eloped with him. They will return once his money and your daughter's jewellery are spent. Go! They shout unnecessarily at police but don't know to look after children. We will inform after finding. - Hello. - Friend. - Tell me the matter. - His name is Thota Venkat Rao. He has a mangrove. i want it. i tried by threatening him. He acted in haste and informed the collector. My work should be done. Murthy, take out the vehicle. When did you buy the property, sir? - 25 years ago. - Oh! - How much it costed at that time? - Two lakhs. - Sir, what is the price in market now. - it is around five crores. Oh! it has increased a lot. Wonderful! Good! So why are you not selling when Voltaire Vasu is asking? He threatened many times to sell for 50 lakhs. Anyway i don't have any intention to sell. i have kept it for my granddaughter. Sir, your son will give to your granddaughter. Why do you take that tension? My son and daughter-in-law died in accident. Only i am there for my granddaughter. But why does Voltaire Vasu say papers are with him and plot belongs to him. Sir, original papers are with me. But he too is showing original papers, sir. if he goes to court by carrying them then you too should go. Will this matter get settled anytime soon? Will your granddaughter enjoy the money from this property? Listen to me. He is saying he will give 50, sign it. Sir, this costs five crores. Sir, is it important than your granddaughter's life? Five crores? You know how big fool he is. What if he kidnaps the girl and keeps her somewhere? What if he kills her? Sir, why should we take these tensions? Sign it. Sir, understand what i am saying. Sign it. Sir, someone has kidnapped the girl. Didn't i tell you? Didn't i tell you that something like this will happen? Sir, they will kill the girl. if something happens to the girl then neither you nor i can save her. Why do you need the property that will kill your granddaughter? Listen to me and sign it. Murthy, give the paper. Sign it, sir. Sign. Sir, please understand what i am saying. Let us save the girl. Sign it. Cheating, sir... lnjustice, sir. Sir, how did you feel like cheating the old man? is this is not called a cold blooded murder then what is it, sir. Sir, don't you feel anything? - Don't you have conscience? - i have saved. Otherwise they would have killed. In return i got 50 lakhs for him. There is one such angle, Murthy. Why don't you think? Oh! is there a reason to your foolish deeds? Sir, this is not correct. You are committing mistake. Being a police officer, for a loafer. You are supporting Voltaire Vasu. i am seeing from childhood. He is a big criminal. isn't it? You are seeing him, right? You know he is a criminal. You and he are staying here since 25 years. So why don't you kill him? Take the gun. Go and shoot him. What will happen to you in return? You will get hanged. Die. The justice that you believe in will survive. if you can do it then do. Otherwise shut up and keep quiet. Don't shout unnecessarily. Stay on that side or this side. People like you who stay in between are not of any benefit to the country... ...or your family, Murthy! Justice, honesty, country, patriotism... stop the nuisance! Learn to count how many bundles of... ...500 and 1000 currency notes are there in that bag. Ugh! it is illegal money! i will not touch it. Look... look, this is your note and this is mine. This is justice and this is injustice. Here... i have crushed them together. Tell me! Tell me! Tell me which is your note and mine. Tell me, Murthy! Murthy, the honesty inside you is not there in this note. Don't shout! The first witness for every injustice that happens in the country. They have kept.. they have kept a photo on this. Here... keep it... keep it and... - ...take that bag home. - i don't want. Okay, you are my bank. i am depositing them with you. Keep it. Hey! it will be good if a tsunami comes... ...and you get drowned. it will be good if you die! Call! Call... call which tsunami you will call... call! Pray to the God you worship. i will sit here all night! Yes! Tell the tsunami to come. i will take it. Murthy, it will not come for me specially. When it comes, you, me... ...Voltaire Vasu, old man, his granddaughter and everyone will die. it has no confusions like you and me. it has more clarity. it will come, drown us and carry us. Tsunami? Tsunami. i will sit here. Tell it come! Why doesn't it come? You are talking as if i committed rapes or murders. Why do you join the department for nuisance. Father. Today is the last day. if i don't pay the fees then they will not allow me to write exams. They will remove me from college. Use that money if you need anything. i will not feel anything. - How much has to be paid? - 40,000. Dear, your father doesn't have so much money. Why should you wait till they remove you? You quit college. You quit college. All the police families are doing well. Only we are crying like this. Mother's bad luck. You are born to a father who couldn't educate his daughter. People like you who stay in between are not of any benefit to the country... ...or your family, Murthy. Hey! Hi! - Happy birthday! - Thank you. Tell me. Ask me what you want. Will anyone ask like that? You should give something. What should i give? if you don't like what i give you now then where should i keep it. These saris and all... i can't do all that. Mobiles? TV's? Electronic gadgets? Tell me anything from these smuggled items. They will come in five minutes. i will ask if i want. But please don't take me in police jeep today. Please. it is minimum common sense to bring a bike... ...when you take your girl friend to movie. Correct... correct... correct... what shall we do now? Why don't i stop someone? He is correct. Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Police! i have all papers. Who wants your papers? i want your bike. Get down... get down...get down. - is it a chase, sir? - What? - Chase? - Why do you want? Get down! Talking of chase? Hey, come to the station in the evening and take your bike. - So what should i take now? - Use my vehicle. Use my jeep... use it nicely. - You sit. - Sit, madam. Sit. Hey, fill the tank and return in the evening... enjoy. Full tank? Who is he? There are dogs in your department, right? They are very trained and intelligent, right? Hmm. We asked many times. They didn't give. Our dogs are to be bred. Will you arrange for it? it has been long time... nobody cares for us. if dogs need it, you ask it decently. When we ask for it, they look at us like dogs. Let us set something. Don't know this world. - Which shop you want? - What for? - For frying and eating. - i hate killing fish. - Chicken? - No. - Mutton? - No. - So what do you eat? - Lentils... ghee. - Oh! - Brinjal curry. - Mango... drumsticks vegetable soup. - Oh! So don't you want papad? We shouldn't eat all these if it is not there. - So should i eat? - No! Anyway they are dead. if they are thrown into the sea again, sea will get dirty. You wait. Hey, tell me which fishes you have. Sir, i have all varieties. What all varieties? Throw the net down. What is this? What is this? Pamphlet, cat fish. - What are they? - They too are same. - Leave it. These are good. Give them. - Okay. Give four. - Okay. - Yes. Hey! Leave me! Hey! Who are you? How dare you touch my girlfriend! Hey! Daya! Forget! Forget! Forget her! Hey, catch her! - Hey! - Daya! - Leave her i say! - Daya! Hey! Whom i told you to bring and who did you bring? - Sorry, brother. sorry... sorry. - Leave me! - Mistake happened. - What mistake? i mean we didn't want this girl.. they brought her. - Hey. - Brother, she was sitting on that bike. What bike? Will you bring anybody who sits in that bike? - Hey! - Didn't i tell it is a mistake? Sorry, brother. - Brother, sorry. - Who had beaten her? Sorry... sorry... sorry, brother. - See how they beat her. - Sorry... sorry. She is my life. My girl friend. - Will you take out knives on her? - Say sorry. - Say sorry. - Brother, sorry... sorry. - What sorry? - You come here... come. Sorry, brother... sorry, brother.. take her away... she is scared. You come to the guest house. We will talk. Sanvi, you don't take any tension. Tell your family members that you fell down from bike. Don't fear. Go and sleep. When did you come? What happened? i couldn't sleep all night. it happened by mistake. Forget it. They tried to kill me by thinking of me to be some other girl. But had they killed. What would have happened to you? My mother, grandmother and our life.. what would have happened. Nothing happened now. Forget it as a nightmare. What if the girl they are looking for is found? They will kill her, isn't it? She has a life. She must be having a family, right? it is a mistake to kill a person, right? i couldn't sleep all night by thinking of that girl. i have been crying. Daya, i don't know who that girl is. But she should live. You should save her as a sincere police officer. Her life is the birthday gift that you will give me. Sanvi! He is a friend and she is girl friend. i don't know the girl whom i should save. Where are you? Why are you here? i told you to come to the guest house, right? Keep this gun with you. if anybody comes closer, shoot them. Hey! Hey! Why are you giving the gun to her? Because of this girl, your girl friend was beaten. - Leave this girl! - What? Leave this girl, brother. Why? is she too your girl friend? if something happens to her then my love will become a problem. Problem only to your love. if i leave her then it is a problem to my life. Hey! Bring her! Hey! What is this angle? Didn't i tell not to touch? Why did you show a new angle? There are many more angles. Oh! Hey, there are four dogs in my farm house. i give them pedigree and money to you. That is the only difference. Will you answer back to me? You have touched the wrong point. Didn't i already tell you that ego surrounds me like wifi? it is on! Wifi is on. Turn it off. Use name Daya! Password police! if you have guts then cross my wifi and come. Hey! Hey! Hey! You talked about friendship. is it this? What is the friendship between you and me? You are villain and i am hero. Hey, you were in adjacent state and i brought you here. Yes! So here.. i am lnspector Daya talking. Listen carefully. Your time has started. Only Vizag will be there, Vasu will not be there in it. From today i will target everything that belongs to you! i will make you lose your sleep. i will sleep in your heart. - With me.. will you fight with me? - Hey! if two people fight with me then it is war. if one attacks alone... ...then it is attack. This is Daya's attack. Brother, he is not in the station and not in the house. What shall we do now? Call him. He is disconnecting it. - What? - He disconnected the phone. What does he think? What does he think? Username is Daya! Password police! What is the friendship between you and me? You are villain, i am hero. Murthy, i talked a lot. Murthy, everyone has ego.

Come on! Did i stop there? No! i will make you lose your sleep. i will sleep in your heart. He gave me a beautiful flat for me to sleep. Murthy, why should i sleep in his heart as if there is no place anywhere? Will he not get hurt? Attack! This is Daya's attack. What is that word attack, Murthy? i didn't read it anywhere.. i didn't watch in any movie. How do you think this word came to my mouth? i lost my control! Murthy, he is a good person. Had it been me, i would have killed. Attack? Attack? My hell! - Hey! - Brother. Go and sit in police station. - Kill him immediately after he comes. - Go and kill! Okay, brother. Hey! Stop! Stop! He has sent some message. East or west, friendship is the best. See what message he has sent. He says, East or west, friendship is the best. - What should i do? - Brother, another message has come. See. Ours is not a challenge between brothers. Our is brotherly relationship. Crap! Crap! You! Brother, it seems he is afraid. He will fear. Now he must be knowing... ...nothing exists without Vasu. Call... Minister? - Sir! - What? i heard you are frightened of a small boy. They say you don't take the call or reply to sms. Message? i will kill him. Don, talk! There will be many issues. Am i not there in between? Look, i am coming to the guest house in ten minutes. - Make arrangements. - Bring! Bring! First bring! Hey, he is coming with Minister. Come! Come! - Sir. - Are you mad? What if i get shot? Why did you become like this? Sir, he has put so much fire.. he is put a burning stick.. - Hey.. Leave he gun. - Sir. Forget what happened. i came to make you both compromise. Poor boy! See how he is repenting. - Kid? - Yes. - He? - Yes. Why do you say like that? What should i do now? Sir, i will not talk to him unless he hugs me. - Hug him. - Okay. Poor kid! Take him closer and console him. You both hug... hug each other. Come.. come. Don't smell me. i feel irritated. Ah! He bit me! He bit me! Small kid.. maybe his teeth. - Finished, right? - Let us have a drink. Where is the girl? Hey, you! Where is the girl? i came to a different place.. for whom? isn't it for you? Will you take revenge on me? Wrong.. Hey, you stop. He is changing the topic. - Tell me. Where is the girl? - Look. i never called anyone as brother. i called only you. So will you declare war on this brother? Who started it? You or me? You must have started. Otherwise why will the boy say like that? Who? is he a boy? He said he will give life for friendship. Didn't i give? Where did i fire? i fired somewhere in the air? Did i fire in your heart? What does it mean? What is the meaning, sir? - What is the meaning? - Hey! Don't confuse me! Tell me. Where is the girl? Hey! Why are you watching like that? Are only the five of you brothers? Am i not? - What will you drink? - What am i asking and what he is saying? You? i am asking what you will drink! Hey! Will you address me informally? Should i do that? Should we call elder brother like that? Aren't you my elder brother? Should we call brother as sir? Why did he become like this nowadays, sir? Why do you have so much ego? Why do you get so angry? You! Yes, Vasu. These days your ego has become more. - Who? Me? - Yes, you! Sit! Drink! We will talk later. Ask him where the girl is. Everything after drinking. Sit and drink. Sit, Vasu. Where is Laxmi? Who is Laxmi? You beat us and took her away. Oh! is her name Laxmi?

Where is the girl? - Why do you want that girl? - To play hopscotch, Hey, you don't seem to understand the seriousness in matter. You must be thinking that you will save her because your girl friend asked. My brothers, lives.. Look, she has got a proof with her. if it is leaked then lives of my brothers will end. - What did your brothers do? - Why do you want all that? Tell me where the girl is? i should kill her. What is the need to kill her for taking the proof? You want girl or proof? Proof. i will bring that proof. - Will you leave her? - Will she give you? if she trusts anybody on this earth now then it is me. i will bring. Leave her. My situation too is the same. if i trust anybody in this earth then... ...it is only you. My brothers, lives... i am leaving by trusting you. - Murthy, take out the vehicle. - Sir, what you are doing is wrong. Cheating, sir. Don't cheat that girl. Stop, Murthy! Don't irritate me. Do as i say. is your fear lost? You are crying since the time you came but you are not telling what happened. What happened? Who are they? if you trust me that i will remove your problem then tell me. i work in New York. Mother and sister stay here. i came to lndian to see them. Sister should have come to the airport to receive me... ...she didn't come. Don't know what happened. Mother and i searched extensively. We didn't know her whereabouts. One day we received a call. Sister, i don't know whether i will stay alive or not by the time you come. - Where are you? - Don't know. i was coming to the airport for you... ...brothers of Voltaire Vasu brought me here. Sister, i have seen hell. They said they will kill me today. Kill you? What are you talking, Deepti? Sister, you don't know. Death is much better than these people. They had shot everything in video camera. i have seen them keeping that CD in lorry. Phone too is not mine. i am sending GPS. Hey! Whom are you calling? After that i went to the address sent by Deepti. Deepti! They killed my sister, sir. Sir, Vasu's brothers have raped and killed my sister. i trusted a media person by mistake... ...and told about the CD. He is Voltaire Vasu's man. He cheated me. After that i got frightened to tell anybody. And then you saved me. - Does mother have American Visa? - Yes. Then give me the CD and go to America with mother. Do you trust me? Do you trust me? - i trust you. - Come, let us go home. Don't tell this matter to mother. She doesn't know anything. She says police told her that Deepti eloped with some boy. Mother believes it.

We should leave for America immediately. America? Now? Yes. Hello. Book two business class tickets to America urgently. i am sending both mother and daughter there. Hey...

Murthy, why are you looking at me with disgust? i am sending mother and daughter to America safely. From there i will go and give the CD to Voltaire Vasu. This is what is doing to happen. Murthy, nobody can give a better solution to this problem. Stop watching like that. What? Why do you look at me with disgust? Didn't i tell you not to watch like that? You go. First you go to station. Don't stand in front of my eyes. Go! Go! Okay, Sanvi. No problem. Entire problem is solved. i am sending Laxmi and her mother to America. - is she next to you? - Yes, one minute. Hi, Laxmi. Happy journey. Thank you, Sanvi. Okay, listen.

Burning... sister, they are burning the entire body. They have burnt her with acid. In Gandhi's country.. on the day of Gandhi's birthday... ...they have kidnapped my sister, brother. See that CD once, brother. Don't spare them easily. They should get punished according to the law. Entire country should know. if anybody tries to do it again then should be die out of fear. Brother, who have the freedom for these animals to roam free... ...on roads in my country. Brother, don't spare such people. My conscience says justice will happen only by you. i will come again when it happens. In Gandhi's country.. on the day of Gandhi's birthday... ...they have kidnapped my sister, brother. - Where are your brothers? - They found a new bird. Sir, our daughter is missing since four days.

Why are you like that, sir? What happened? Sir, you are shedding tears. i never saw you like that. What happened, sir? Something happened in the airport, sir.

We were on touch till one hour back. He told me to book two business class tickets. He said he will bring the CD. Now she shouted something and left. What did he say, sir? He said it very clearly. He said his mother had a child so he couldn't come. He should be with her when the child is born, right? You are talking of CD since long time. if it is so important then why did you give it to him? - Who gave him Ministry? - What? He has cheated us! He is not our man. He has changed. You brought him and kept him on my head. You only said you wanted a worst guy than you. How come you drop in between? Hey, first leave from here. All of you go underground. - Okay? - What will he do? What will he come and do? What will he do? Hey, do you know what you did? Murder should be like murder.. rape should be like rape. Leaving all that, you shot it yourself with camera... ...and prepare CDs and keep it on my head. Will you keep it? Rascals! Go! Go underground! For the upliftment of the good and virtuous. For the destruction of evil. For the re-establishment of the natural law. i will come, in every age. i will come, in every age. Saviour! Catch her! Run! Run! My saviour has come! You cannot escape him! He is everywhere. He has come! Saviour has come! You got to call him saviour! You got to call him saviour! You got to call him saviour! You got to call him saviour! You got to call him saviour! Brother, he is not allowing us to leave cross Vizag. - What should we do? - Don't come out! Don't come out until i tell you. Hello? Mr. Venkatrao, you had a mangrove, right? We want to buy it. What do you say, sir? i had it. i lost it in land grabbing. Oh! is it? Who did it, sir? it is natural for rowdies to do land grabbing.

He is telling utter lies. Sir, he is telling lies. Sir, i think on Thursday or Friday... ...we came again for Sandhya. But Sandhya was not there. She went to Guntur. i think to your brother's house. i think he lives there. Didn't you fear while committing such crime? Fear for what, sir? What will you do? Maximum punishment will be life imprisonment. Sir, if not this court then another court. There are hundreds of sections.. there are hundreds of tricks. Sir, we are able to rape a girl immediately after seeing her. Are you able to punish immediately? Leave all that, sir. We accept that we committed mistake. Will you be able to hang us in a day or two? it never happened anytime in lndia... ...so how can we hang you within two days, you will say this. Sir, there are already 52 prisoners in this country who got hanged. if you delay in hanging them then by the time... ...our number comes, it will be 25 years later. There will countless Sandhya's and Deepti's by that time. Sir, that's why i like this country very much. Sir, tell me which country provides this kind of freedom. My lndia is great! i am proud to be an lndian! Sir, i have the guts to confess in front of everyone that i committed mistake. Do you have guts to hang us by tomorrow morning? - Hey! - Stop! Order! Order! You! Order! Order! Calm down! On lndian constitution. On country... on women... ...these five people have no respect on them at all... ...have no right to live for another minute. i order them to be hanged them within 24 hours. No, sir! Sir, he told lies! What you they do at the maximum level? They will hang you! Die! But the justice you believe in will survive! Either stay on that side or to this side! Why did you do this? Why did you take the blame on you? Daya, you committed a big mistake. What will happen to me? i cannot live without you. Stop! Hey, dog! How were you born? How did you take birth? Kill him!

First stop the hanging sentence! Daya is not related to this crime at all. Those four people have killed my sister. i have CD with me. Please!

Daya, we received orders to stop you from hanging. Didn't you commit this crime? Entire CD is being telecast on TV. Sir, i don't know the matter of CD now. Have they asked to stop only my punishment or everyone? - Only yours. - So will you kill us by sparing him? Hey! Shut up! Catch him! Leave me! i will kill him! Sir, these rogues have shown her hell for 40 days. Don't kill them with two minutes punishment. Sir, untie me for just 10 minutes and see what happens. - What? - Sir. Anyway you will hang them. Sir, leave them to me for ten minutes before that. Leave me! i will kill him before i die. i will kill you! What are you thinking, sir? About consequences? Don't write in book.
