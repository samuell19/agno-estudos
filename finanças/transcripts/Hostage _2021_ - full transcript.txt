Go! Looks like the kid made it through. I win, you lose. Money? We didn't even dap on it dad. Ashley. Fine. Okay I'm sorry. My name's Christian. I was driving around the neighborhood and I got lost. So I figured I'd stop by your house and ask for directions, and I noticed your window was broken, so I thought I'd just come in- - Christian, huh? Mark, Mark, Mark, already in enough trouble as it is. Why you gotta go and lie to us? We don't like robbers. We don't like rapists. But if there's something that we fucking hate it's liars. Ashley. Yeah? Can I ask you a question? What's up? Why are you wearing sneakers on my nice, clean, expensive carpet? For that matter, why are both of you wearing your shoes in here? I mean, you know how your mother and I feel - about shoes in the house. - Sorry dad. Here, let me help you. Okay I'm sorry, I broke in. It's a nice house. I'm aware that it's a nice house. I bought this house. And the last thing I need is you breaking into this house to tell me how nice my house is. You often go breaking and entering into people's homes on Christmas Eve? Is this some kind of new game you kids have these days? I said I'm sorry, and I thought no one was home - so I- - Oh you thought, 'cause there was no one home, that would make everything okay. Excuse me one moment. Sir, what are you doing? Don't worry about it, I've done this before. Pussy. There, that should help with the swelling. I'm not so sure it's gonna help with this. What is this? Am I bleeding? I don't know Mark, are you? I mean, why would you ask me if you're bleeding. I mean, what makes you think we would know better than you about what's going on down there? It's probably just a scratch. Probably from when you were trying to rape me a few minutes ago. - I wasn't trying anything. - Oh here we go again. I mean, just when we were starting to get along, you start up again with the lies. All right, my name is Thomas Craven. My friends call me Thomas. - Mr. Crav- - Uh, uh. Thomas. Better. I was wondering if I could just explain to you the situation. I know, I know how it looks but I was wondering if I could just explain- - Don't listen to his shit, dad. We aint got time for your bullshit, Mark or whatever your fucking name is. This motherfucker broke in here and tried to rape me right where you're standing, dad. Aint no explaining it, aint no fucking rocket science. Mark, give me a sec, sweetheart, wanna sit over there? Thanks dad. Now, Mark isn't it? So, what's the story Morning Glory? And how you making out with that cut? I'm fine, this is nothing. Splendid. I just wanted to let you know Mr. Crave. Mmm mmm. Thomas. I just want to let you know I've never done this before. I'm not a thief, I'm not a criminal. I've never broken into a house before. The truth is, I'm a father, I lost my job and I have a son and it's Christmas Eve, and we're running out of money fast. I've never been in this situation before. I don't even have enough money to get him a proper meal. If you just look into my wallet. Wait, wait, wait, where's his wallet? I threw it in his face, it's there. This? Yes. That's my boy. Cute kid. So tell me, why did you choose this specific house and not the one on the left or the one on the right or behind, or in front of the house? Why this house? I don't know. It just seemed like a nice house, so I figured, nice house outside, nice things inside. And like I said, it seemed like no one was home and on Christmas Eve that's pretty - hard to find. - He's like a bizarro Santa, instead of sneaking in and leaving shit, he's sneaking in and stealing shit. Make for a dope ass movie. - Honey- - So you guys gonna call the cops? You don't leave us much choice now do you? I mean, what would you do if you were in my position? I guess. Gimme a second Mark. Can you be a sweetheart and go outside and make the call? Sure dad. Attractive girl, huh? - No, I didn't- - No, no, no it's all right, I don't mind, I mean, I was your age once too you know. I guess. What? You calling my daughter ugly? No, I just don't want to disrespect you. You're a funny guy. You don't want to disrespect me? Yet you break into my house, you attempt to rape my daughter and you don't have the courtesy to compliment her on her looks? I don't call that respect, Mark. I call that hypocrisy. - I didn't mean to say it- - Yeah you didn't, yeah. I'm starting to feel a little- - Can I ask you a question? I guess. I mean this might be a tad personal, so. Sure. Are you attracted to girls? By girls? Of course, what are you trying to- - No, no, no, I don't mean to offend you, it's just you know, we're gonna be sitting here for quite some time waiting for the police to get here. And being in this neighborhood, it could be quite a while before they show up. I would expect the opposite around here. Protect you rich folks from us poor people. Yeah, I'd expect that too. I'd like that. But sadly, reality sometimes falls quite far from expectations, sad. Now, we're gonna have some time to get to know each other quite well, Mark. And that's a good thing isn't it? What? You're saying you want to be arrested? - It's not that but- - You break into my house and now you can't wait to break out? I don't know. I don't know how to say this but like, - this whole situation- - They're on their way. Said since we have everything under control and he's tied up, might take a little longer than it usually would. Some shit going on downtown, I don't know. Well you should've told him that we have some nigger here trying- - Dad! I hate when you use that word. We're not in the 1940's anymore, what the fuck is wrong with you? You hear how she talks to me? Kids today, they're so sensitive. You know, you can't call a nigger a nigger now. You gotta say N-word. Or you could say Black person like every other non-racist person post 1965 - but who's counting? - I'm counting. I'm surprised you can count. Fuck that shit dad. You really think he gives a shit in the state he's in? What state? Remember that cut we were looking at before? It turns out, it might be a lot worse than we originally thought. What? What is this? I'm bleeding out here. Can you check under my shirt please? What is wrong with me? Can you lift up my shirt for a second please? - You fucking did this to me. - Hey, let me remind you that you're the one that broke into my house. I am not the criminal here, you are, not us. Can you look after our friend for a while Ashley? I think I can do that. You know, I read somewhere worse thing you can do when you're bleeding a lot is fall asleep, you might not wake up. You know, I have an idea, we should keep talking, keep you from falling asleep. I'm sorry but like, I don't really wanna talk right now, so. All right, suit yourself. But if you start falling asleep, I aint gonna wake you up. Just saying, just trying to help. Fine, what do you want to talk - about? - Yes, okay! - I'll start, so- - No, I'll start. Why do you care if I pass out or whatever? I got caught robbing your house and I'm supposed to believe you two are trying to help me or some shit? I don't know. I guess we're just good people like that. Not everyone's a fucking criminal, Mark. Why you gotta be so negative? I'm negative? You're the one that lied about me trying to rape you and now I'm supposed to believe you didn't fuck with my stomach too? We didn't fuck with your stomach, okay? But who's to say you didn't try and rape me? What, am I supposed to take your fucking word for it? Were you? Were you trying to have sex with me? I wasn't trying anything, you know this. You fucking know this. So you weren't trying to break into my house. Except for that. Are you sure Mark? Are you sure you weren't trying to fuck me? What if I were to tell you that I want you to fuck me? Would you? Would you fuck me Mark? What the fuck is wrong with you? Get the fuck off of me. Chill you fucking pussy. Just trying to keep your ass awake, bitch. You really think I'd let you have sex with me? Oh, this is gonna be the best Christmas ever. You're fucking crazy, don't fucking talk to me. I told you not to do that Mark. And there you go passing out again. Oh and Mark, if you think this is crazy you aint seen nothing yet. Oh, I feel so fucking lame walking around in this dumb outfit. I was gonna go home and change before I met you but I was supposed to be home like, four hours ago. But of course, after the pep rally we went to Stacy's for drinks and shit. Anyways, I forgot my keys at home so I guess I'm gonna have to sneak in up the window or some shit. Like I'm dressed for this shit now. You would have went home to change? You do know you're 30 minutes late, right? Well, I can leave if you'd like. No, that's not what I'm saying. It's just, nevermind, forget it. Oh, Chris. It's okay. Forgiven. Now what are we eating? I'm fucking starving, cheerleading is killing me. I don't know, what do you want to eat? Fuck it, you decide for me. Surprise me, let's see how well you know me. I barely know you. Come on, you're no fun sometimes. You never wanna try anything. Okay, you know what? I think I do know what you'd like. Excuse me? Miss? Miss? What are you calling her miss for? She's like, younger than us. Yes? Can I get the deluxe burger and no cheese please. Pickles on there? Oh, no thanks, I can't stand pickles. All right, and what will the lady be having? Bring her a Philly cheese steak. Oh, interesting choice. All right, coming right up. Anything else you guys want, just give me a buzz. Thanks. Why can't you like, ever order for yourself? I mean, it's kinda stressful to always guess what you want to eat. I don't know, I think if we were right for each other you should be able to know what I want more than I could know what I want. I mean, it's a lot of pressure. Pressure is good, it keeps you on your toes. Chris? Mhmm? Where's my Christmas present? Well it's not Christmas yet. Well, it's Christmas Eve, so. Don't worry, I'll get you your gift. Well guess what? You won't have to guess what I want this time. I know exactly what I want. And the best part is, you won't even have to spend any money on it. If we're talking about what you want, then what did you want to talk about that was like, too sensitive to talk about over the phone? Was it really that big of a deal for you to meet me? No, no, no. Didn't you want to see your girlfriend - on Christmas Eve? - I didn't mean it like that. Okay, if you don't want just say you don't want. No need to make a big fucking deal out of it. Sounds pretty serious. Well, I heard something. Like what? Like, something. Okay well I'm hearing something all the time. Literally hearing something every day. Specific, Ashley. Something surprising. What the fuck was that? That was surprising. You know, I'm getting really sick and tired of your little bitch ass attitude I've seen over the past few weeks. Hey, look I'm sorry. What did you hear? Okay. - So? - What? What did you hear? Oh yeah, nevermind, let's just eat. Fuck Ashley, I didn't come here for a burger, I have food at home. Talking about how the food is, how's that cheese steak? Well, let's see. Good. This tastes like a fucking orgasm. That's a weird comparison. All right, fine. But this stays between us, right? Mhmm. Pinky. Okay, I'm not pinky swearing you. I heard... Mhmm. That... Yeah? You killed someone before. Is it true? Oh shit, hey. Didn't know if you were coming back or not. Why did you let me fall asleep? I told you I wasn't gonna wake you up. Think I'm a liar, Mark? Where's your dad? Thought he went to call 9-1-1. First you don't want to talk and now you don't want to shut up. Gotta make up your mind, Mark. I'm really not feeling too well right now. No shit, you're like, totally bleeding out. Isn't your dad a doctor? Think he could check me out? Check you out? I don't think he rolls that way. That's not what I meant. No, but seriously. Him? A doctor? No, a shrink. A shrink isn't a real doctor. But if you have any mommy issues he might be able to help you out. Isn't that the same thing? Is a robber the same thing as a rapist? Not even close. Same thing. So your dad's a shrink? Yes, Mark. Well that explains a lot. What is that supposed to mean? Hey, sorry for the delay. Your mom's home. Family reunion, dining room. Mark and I are just in the middle of something here- - Ashley. Let's go. Fine, chill. But who's gonna watch over our little birdy here? Little birdy, stay. See? Let's go. Hi Ashley. Hi mom. What did you do this time? What do you mean what I did this time? Watch your tone, is that how I raised you? I don't know, how did you fucking raise me? Can you two calm down please. We're all in the same boat here and that boat is sinking fast. I mean, can we all just work together as a team? Just for tonight? And then when all is said and done you two can go back to hating each other. But for now, we're in a big mess here, - a big fucking mess. - How is this such a big mess? The way I see it, it's all pretty fucking simple. We just let him go. He takes off into the night, fade out, roll credits, end of story, what's the big deal? Am I missing something? You two aren't actually thinking of calling the cops are you? Should I take this or do you want to do the honors? Allow me. Honey, let's put all the potential options and outcomes on the table. A very good idea. Option number one, we let him go. He's seriously wounded and severely bleeding. The way I see it, if he doesn't get to a doctor in the next few hours, it's curtains for him. So we let him go. Now I don't know about you but I'm pretty damn sure that's a stab wound. What? Who, between you two geniuses, decided that it would be a good idea to stab him? Well I know I didn't and from what I've seen, I'm pretty certain Ashley didn't either. So, to answer your question, I don't fucking know. Don't look at me, I don't fucking know. Ha ha oh okay, so he breaks into the house, seemingly un-stabbed, you three bozos get into a playground scuffle, then all of sudden he's just magically stabbed. That's your story. Dad, why are we wasting our time with Sherlock Holmes here? We were doing just fine until she showed up. Yes, you were doing just peachy, trust me, if I knew what you dickheads were up to I'd be across the state line by now. Can I continue? I mean, are you two done? Please proceed. Okay, so we let him go. I don't know about you, but how much trust do you want to put on a thief? I mean, all it will take is for him to just point us out and then we're fucked. I don't know, I mean, maybe we are overthinking this. I mean really, what is he gonna do? Go to the cops and be like, "Yeah I broke into this house and this chick beat me up and here's her address." It's unlikely, but I think your father's right on this one. We can't take this lightly. He got into our house, he knows what we look like. Well, what you two look like. You beat him up, tied him up. All it takes is for him to tell one of his compadres then who knows where that could lead us. We can't take that chance. So our only option is what I think it is then. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that either. But I don't know, I mean, what else can we do? I'm fine with it, really. Ashley calm down, did one of you forget to lock the doors or something? How the hell did he get in here? Broke the window. Ugh, of course he did. These fancy houses got so many windows, we might as well sleep outside. All right, I'm gonna go talk to the guy. Talk to him? Fuh what? Fuh? What's fuh? Vietnamese soup? Where are your R's? You're too cool to use R's now? Thomas, listen to your daughter, talking like a fucking nigger. She's not getting that from me, that's for sure. You two make a great couple, y'all know that? And that's the thanks we get. All right, I'm gonna talk to him. Fuck what you two think, I need to size him up - for myself. - You know this motherfucker tried to rape me, right? Dad, you told her right? I told her. Ashley, listen to me. We're not just gonna go do what you think we're gonna do just because you think we should do it. This is not just fucking getting dressed in the morning, all right? This this is a big deal. Now, we've got a few hours until the sun comes up. We need to figure this out, okay? Thomas, okay? Your mother's right. I mean, we have to take this seriously. I mean, we cannot take this lightly. All right. Fine then, talk to him. See if I fucking care. Ashley. You know, it was you who always wanted a daughter. I mean, if you're ever gonna act on it, I think tonight might be as good a night as you'll ever get. I knew you'd forget to introduce yourself to the neighbors. I'm gonna go get them a nice bottle of wine and make a great first impression just like they do in the movies. Shit, I bet five bucks you wouldn't. We both know I'm the responsible one. You're joking, right? Not joking, actually speaking facts. Facts, yeah. Are you sure you have the right definition? Have you looked up the meaning? I did, and it said that I'm always right and you're always fucking wrong. That's what it said anyways. Yeah, well you're a funny woman you know that? That's why I married you. Your sense of humor. I always thought it was because of my ass but, I guess sense of humor makes it sound more romantic. Well you're welcome. You know what? Sending the kid to the arcade tonight was actually a pretty good idea. Sending the kid any night is always a good idea. Look, I told you, you're worried for nothing. It's just the arcade, it's a good neighborhood. And we can't keep treating her like a baby anymore. She needs to learn to do things on her own, make friends. It's essential to the development of a good teenager. Let me know when we're speaking English again. Ha ha. Is she back yet? I don't know, who cares? I think you're hard on her. I know she's not always easy but it's just, she's a kid. This is normal kid bullshit. We were kids once, remember? Years ago. First of all, I don't like this years ago thing at all. I don't know, I just, I feel like something's off with her. Just try and not be too hard on her, okay? She needs time to adapt. Plus, she just moved into a completely new city, this is not easy for her. Grace, she's going to need her mother. I swear, something's wrong with your daughter. Look, I'm sorry but we both know this. And don't try to psychoanalyze our relationship now. Fine. I thought the goal of tonight was to forget about the kid and work and everything. Do we really need to talk about this right now? You're right. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm happy. We're celebrating, right? Yeah. What are we celebrating? We're celebrating no phone lines. No your mother living upstairs from us. And soon, no clothes. You just can't keep your hands off me, can you? When I can I ever? Fuck dinner, I always wanted to do it on the mattress on the floor. Yeah, mattress on the floor is very fun. - I hate you. - Prove it. I'm really not feeling too well. Is there still nothing from the ambulance? What's taking them so long? Hi. What's his name again? What's your name again? Mark, and I'm in need of an ambulance. What sort of fucking games are we playing here? What's the matter with you people? I don't care if you live in Timbuktu, ambulances don't take this long to arrive. Oh my god. Has he been this much fun this entire time? No wonder you guys wanted to keep him all for yourselves. Oh, I'm all excited. All right Mark, are you even listening? Let me break this down into simple terms. You really picked the wrong fucking family to rob tonight. The ambulance. Their aint no ambulance coming you fucking idiot. What do you mean there's no ambulance coming? What are you talking about? You called the cops? They would've taken me to the hospital- - Oh my god. There's no cops coming, there's no ambulance coming. Aint nobody coming Mark. But you called. Actually, I pretended to call. Actually, I didn't call jack shit. Yeah, not very smart, that's what I thought. You know what? I wanted to bet on it. But I didn't. You know that feeling when you just know something but you don't say it? Like you think, oh, what if I'm wrong? I don't want to look stupid. But then every time you didn't say it, ah, maybe not every time but it feels like every time. I'll just say it, every time. You were right, you were fucking right. You want to tell your friends, I knew this was gonna happen but I just didn't say it. Yup, I get that all the time. Like for me, usually it's when I'm watching a movie, right? Like, you just know what like, a character's gonna say next like everything just lines up for like, you're sure of it. Sometimes it's these like, corny lines or whatever but sometimes it's actually things that are pretty hard to guess. And you don't say it. You think, shit, if I say it at the exact same time as the character, everyone in the room is gonna be so impressed. But you stop yourself, oh. And then sure enough, the character says the exact line you thought he or she was gonna say. And then you turn to your friends and you're like I knew he was gonna say that and they go like, yeah, okay. Most annoying thing ever, right? What the fuck are you talking about? Huh, what am I talking about? No ambulances are coming, no cops are coming. So what, you guys are just gonna let me go? I don't know Mark, I don't know yet. Depends on you actually. But if you don't let me go, then what? I'm pretty sure you can draw your own conclusions Mark. What is this? Is this some sort of joke? I wish this was a joke but this is serious. As serious as an HIV test, that's how serious this is. That shit is serious. Let me go you fucking psychos. Aw Mark, she just wants to talk to you okay? I promise I won't let her hurt you unless you deserve it, okay? Don't fucking touch me. You're fucking crazy. All of you are fucking crazy. Let me go, let me go! Let me go! Stop calling me crazy, Mark. I don't like people calling me crazy. I won't touch you, but just stop calling me that okay? I asked you a fucking question, okay? Okay. All right Ashley, we get it. Stop swinging your dick. I said I would talk to him so let's talk. So you guys are not gonna let me go are you? I told you Mark, I don't know yet. We can't just let you get back out there if you're gonna talk to people about us. Talk about what? I don't even know who you guys are. Mmm, I think you know too much already. And why would I talk about the house I broke into and got my ass kicked by a little kid? Who you calling a kid? And woke up tied to a chair on some S&M shit, why the fuck would I want to talk to anyone about that? - That's what I said. - No one asked you Ashley. Your role in this story is to be the pretty girl, okay? So play the part. Bitch. Are they always like this? Actually, this is a good day. All right, can we focus for a minute here? Happy you two are getting along so well, that's great. Look, he's not a bad kid. He just got mixed up in a bad situation. True, except for the whole raping your daughter and shit. Great guy. I wasn't trying to rape you. When are you gonna get that in your fucking head? You guys better let me go this time. You better let me go, you better let me go! Let me go! So that's how you want to do this? Help! Anyone, help! All right Ashley, shut him up. - What? Seriously? - Before I change my mind. I'm killing him though, right? No, no, wait, wait, who said anything about killing anyone? All right, what did you bring? I promise I'll be quiet, I swear. Just please don't hurt me. Are you sure you'll be quiet? Like Ashley just went through - the entire- - Yes, I promise. Silence of the lambs, I swear. Ashley, hold that thought okay? But mom. Ashley. I think I have an idea. Oh, do tell. Would Mark happen to be a father? Actually, Mark would happen to be a father. He's got a cute little kid. In fact, that's why he breaks into houses on Christmas daddy dearest. I told you, I've never done this before. My back's against the wall. What would you do if you couldn't afford to buy your daughter a meal? Let her die? Mmm, shit happens. Kids die every day. People die, so what? Now Grace, that's enough. Even in this situation, you can't keep your shit together? I mean, what did she ever do that was so bad? Do we really have to do this now? Yes, we really do have to do this now. You seem to want to do it now which means I have to do it now. I mean, I don't care if we have the fucking pope over for dinner, you don't talk about our daughter that way. Our daughter. Right. Perfect little Ashley. Just, what was that idea you mentioned a little while ago? Mark, what does your son look like? Actually, there's a picture down there. Hmm, honey would you mind? I have to do everything around here. Why do you want a picture of my son? Simple, Mark. Here's how this will play out. Listen closely, because this is your only chance to get out of this. I'll try to say it as clearly as I can. Oh, wait, by the way are you a righty or a lefty? Right. I will untie your right hand. In your hand, I will place a pencil. Under that pencil will be a small piece of paper. On that piece of paper, you will write the following. Your son's Christian name followed by his family name, in that order. Underneath that, you will write down his social security number. Wait, how old is your kid? He's six. Okay, then he has one for sure. Just that before 1986, some parents could sometimes have kids well above the age of 14 years old and not get them their social security numbers. But at the end of 1985, they stopped all that. Now you can't basically go above like five, without registering your kids. Hmm, the more you know. Anyway, we will need that number. Underneath that number, we will need the name of his school, then under that we'll need his date of birth and then the city and hospital in which he was born. Wait, why should I give you all this information about my son? What keeps me from telling you both to fuck off and I aint giving y'all shit? That's a good question. Here's an idea. Supposing he doesn't tell us. We've got enough to find him. So we bring them both to the basement, we kill the little bastard in front of him, we leave the kid to rot and then we keep him alive by force feeding him until there's nothing left but rot. And then we kill him. I just thought about that. I mean, can we just do that? No. Is that enough? It's good for me. What are you guys gonna do with all that? Simple, Mark. If we let you go, we need to know that you're not gonna go blab about us. About us living here, about you coming to this house. We need you to forget Mark. Forget that we exist. We need to become more than distant memories, we need to fade completely away from your mind. Because if we ever let you go, Mark if you ever leave this house still breathing, and you ever so much as dream of us, you won't like what happens next. Ashley probably will, but you won't. We can't be talking about this shit. Still haven't answered the question Chris. I mean, are we a couple? Are we together? Yes or no. Or are you just fucking me? That doesn't have to do with any of this. Keeping secrets from me, Chris? What else are you hiding from me? What? Are you cheating on me? You can tell me. I already know. Seriously, just tell me it's fine. I know what you're trying to do here Ashley. It's not gonna work this time. I'm telling you. I knew it, I fucking knew you were cheating on me. Who is it? That little whore slut Stephanie? I saw the way that you were looking at her at the party last weekend. Stacy said, "No, he wouldn't do that." But I knew you were fucking - cheating anyways. - Okay, okay, okay, fine. You win, okay? You gave it a good fight, babe. Now talk to me, lay it on me papi. Okay, but I didn't sleep with anyone else though, okay? Duh. What? Do you think I'm stupid? Or are you stupid? I'm just messing with you, geeze. Come closer, I don't want to talk about this shit in the open, okay? There aint nobody in this joint. All right. Yes, I did. But just once okay? Now, can we please change the topic? No we can't change the topic motherfucker. Please quiet down. All right, all right, fine you little pussy. But you did it, whatever. Not a big deal. Not a big deal? You're clearly not all there then Ashley. I'm not the one who just confessed to murder in a fucking public place. Wow. So, who was it? - Can we talk in- - Chris, come on. This is called communication. That's what a relationship's all about, right? Hold up, who told you about this? I've never even talked about it with anyone. A good reporter never reveals her sources. You aint even a fucking reporter though. Whatever, I aint snitching on the plug. A little birdy told me, okay. It was Steve wasn't it? It was. Maybe. I fucking knew it, that piece of shit. You know, I never even really told him about it. I didn't deny it either, but I mean. Mhmm, you know, you look good but you're not very smart. What? So, who was it? My dad. You killed your fucking dad? He was scum. He bit the shit out of me and my sister. You know, he didn't even care about us. You know, you could beat me all you want. I can take that. But don't touch my fucking sister. Fuck. Yeah, fuck. So how'd you do it? I didn't do it on purpose. But this one time he was beating on my sister and I never actually physically stepped in but this time, I don't know what got into me, maybe I was like, tweaking or some shit but I just, I pushed him as hard as I could. And my dad, he was a big motherfucker, okay, he was like, a big guy. And I pushed him as hard as I could and I punched him and he just dropped straight to the ground. Gone, like just, gone. And my sister tried to wake him up and shit but he was dead. Shit. Yeah, shit. So how'd you get away with it? It was actually my sister, she was trying to protect me. You know, at the time, I honestly didn't care if I got arrested or not, or even got caught. But my sister, she was upset yeah, that my dad was dead, but she didn't want me to go to jail either. So she was like, yeah he's dead but he was also an alcoholic and beat us and abused us. So we dragged his body to the bathtub, we sat him in it, ran some warm water and framed it as if he fell and hit his head in the bathtub. And it was actually pretty funny 'cause we brought him to the hospital a few months before for the same god damn thing. - What? No you didn't. - Yeah, we did. And then we called the police. And that shit flew? Well, I'm sitting here aren't I? I want you to kill my mom. What? What what? What do you mean what what? You just asked me to kill your mom. You can't what what me. Can you do it or no? You're fucking with me aren't you? What's so hard about killing my mom? You killed your dad, my mom should be easier. Fuck you Ashley, that's not the point here. What, you think I'm a fucking hit man or some shit? No, I'm not killing your mother. Oh come on, I'd do it myself but if I did, my dad would know for sure it was me. Forget it Ashley, I aint doing it. Well, I don't know what to tell you Chris. So what are you gonna do then? Pay someone else to do it. What do you mean pay someone else? You were gonna pay me to do it? 50 bands. $50,000? Aw, you thought just because you're fucking me I wouldn't compensate you? Where the fuck did you get $50,000? Let's just call it my trust fund, college money. I aint going, so who the fuck cares? And you have access to that shit? I aint just have access. I have it. Fuck, you're just walking around with this? Who's gonna fuck with me? Is this real? Last I checked. You're insane. And now you're repeating yourself. Chris, really, it's not that complicated. You just wait for her outside, pull up, shoot, pow. And dip, wait in your car, something discrete, I don't know. As long as you peel off and they can't connect it back to me, can't connect it back to you. And I could do it however? So you're gonna do it? I mean, speaking hypothetically. Well yeah, no. The less I know the better, for the both of us. I don't know if that's a good plan Ashley. I mean, I got away with it once. You think I can get away with it again? Chris, we don't need a plan. Like, besides my dad, nobody knows I hate her and there aint no money coming to me if she dies so why would the police think it's me? And this could go down whenever? Well, not next fucking year but yeah, whenever. I don't know, I don't care. Like, one in three murders goes completely unsolved in this country, no obvious connections. You really think they're gonna figure it out? Do you know how dumb the cops are in this town? But you know we're talking about murder, right? Like, we're talking about your mom's life. We're talking my life here. Like, fuck though, you can't come on me. You want me to come on you? If I had known you were this crazy- - What? You would've fucked me harder? Forget it, you're not even taking this shit seriously. Find someone else. Chris. So we doing this? Or are you gonna keep pump faking? Double, triple, quadruple check everything on there. If as little as a dot on an I is missing from something Grace is gonna stick your head up your ass faster than a rabbit gets fucked. Especially considering I'm going to check on the little man right now. You wanna go right now? I mean, I don't know about leaving him alone that long. It's fine, I can go alone. You aint going alone Grace. I mean, this has set up written all over it. You walk in that joint, the next thing you know, little man's lighting you up his god damn self. Fourth of July in December. Then you come with me and Ashley can keep him company. I don't know about leaving her with him. Thomas, she'll be fine. Plus, she needs to start pulling her weight around here. The man is tied up. Just like, tie his other arm and make sure he's not going anywhere, she'll be fine. It's fine dad, really. She's right. You sure? You don't have to do this. - Whatever. - I swear dad. And if anything, I'll just call y'all on the car phone. Promise. We'll be back as soon as we can. I would've gone and done this alone - but what with- - But yes, this is my plan and if you want something done right. Aha, little birdy want to play, huh? Come on, let's go. Hey Mark, can I ask you a question? Not really, no. What was your relationship like with your mom? What is this? The Oprah show? I'm sorry, but my mind is elsewhere right now. Okay. What if I were to let you go? What's your mindset like now? Let me go? Mhmm. And why would you do that? I'm tired. I'm tired. You're tired? Yeah, I'm tired. I'm tired of all of it, I'm tired of everything. I really don't think you're gonna go to the cops and if you do, whatever. We're all gonna get what's coming to us anyways including you. So yeah, I'm tired. I mean, what? You want to stay here and get killed? I mean, I don't mind. What do you want? Okay, first of all, can you at least try and be nice? I mean, I'm being nice here. You got me tied up to a chair all fucked up. How is that nice to you? You're the one who broke in here. And you were the one that was about to come down here and torture me about 20 minutes ago. Oh yeah. Oh and by the way, full disclosure. I'm the one that stabbed you. - What? - What? What did you think that this was some sort of plot twist? Some conspiracy about how you got stabbed? Nope, you were out and I was bored, so I stuck this in you. You're fucking sick. Okay, let's just call it even. And how is this even close to even? Enough with all the questions, Mark. I stabbed you, I fucking stabbed you and that's payback. So you want to get out of here or no? So play nice and tell me about your mom. She was all right. What do you mean, all right? I don't know, she was a normal mother. I don't know what you expect me to tell you. The truth, that's it. Unless you want to wait for my parents to come back 'cause that's happening real soon. Ashamed. Ashamed? Bitch please, whatchu mean I'm ashamed fo? No. My mom. That was the first thing that came to my mind when I thought of her. Ashamed of me. Now we're talking. Whatchu mean? My mom raised me alone. She did her best, she really did. I never got what you had. In the projects working two jobs just to keep the lights on and me running the streets at her back. Know that rap song? Just this one doesn't have me drinking champaign when I'm thirsty. Nice B.I.G reference. I don't know. I know all this shit sounds like a cliche but that's the one thing about cliches, they're often close to the truth. It took me a long time to understand. Took me a long time just to get it. Like to understand where she got that motivation from, where she got all that energy to do everything she did. And it was all for me. And still to this day, I haven't even been able to thank her for it. All she ever wanted for me was something better. For me to be a better person. Fast forward, now I aint shit. And even if you were to compare the two of us, I'm even less. So yeah. Where is she now? Not sure. She could be gone, I don't know. But if she could see me now, shame. That's what she'd feel for me and that's already more than I deserve. I wish I had a mom who cared that much. Are you serious right now? Yeah, I'm fucking serious. Do you see the way she talks to me? And that's on a good day. This is a good day? I've seen worse. Wow, whatever. You're really gonna buy this whole act your mom's putting on? It's not an act, it's true, trust me. It's bullshit. Are you really gonna buy this whole I hate my daughter act? Yeah I buy it, 'cause it's fucking true. It's bullshit. If you weren't so focused on yourself you'd see it too. Enlighten me then. I just think if parents didn't care about their kids they just wouldn't care. And if your mom really did hate you she wouldn't be riding you this hard all the time. Some people just don't know how to show it. You think you had a fucked up life? Did you ever think for once maybe your mom had it worse and maybe that's the reason why she is who she is? Like I said, some people don't know how to show it but it doesn't mean they don't feel it. And like that, I think you two have that in common. Just saying. Who is it? Good evening, I just wanted to warn you that you and your husband are going to die tonight. It's kinda tragic, but there's nothing you can do about it. We will kill you. You have about 30 seconds before the fun starts. We thought we'd give you a heads up because we like to play fair. - Grace? - So grab a knife, or a baseball bat or whatever makeshift weapon you can find and just so you know, there's also a very bad man - waiting at the back door. - Grace what's up? - Who is it? - Thomas listen. Please, we need to run. No, what's going on Grace? She said she was gonna kill us. What are you talking about? They gave me a simple choice. Either kill my mom or they'll kill us both. I was 10 years old. When they saw me hesitating, they told me what happened to my father. She killed your dad, she shot him. That they weren't the one that killed him. That my mom... Oh my god, don't do this. Strong. I love you so much- So you expect me to believe this shit? They shot your dad and then you got adopted by your real parent's killers? You might be fucked, but you'd be even more fucked if that actually happened. I guess it's too early for you to realize how actually fucked I am. I mean, did you listen to anything I just said. If you really look at it, they didn't actually kill anybody. This time. My real mom and I did all the work. It's not that fucking easy to kill people and take their identities. Like, what happened to the bodies? Did these people not have family or friends? People leave paper trails. Other people ask questions. They knew what they were fucking doing. They chose people they thought wouldn't be missed too much. The real Thomas and the real Grace grew up in foster homes. And after I shot my mom, they burned the bodies and here we are. Anyways, I don't really give a fuck if you believe me or not. A deal's a deal, right? What are you doing? Think I'm a liar? They're probably on their way back here now. If I were you, I'd get your son and I'd get the hell out of state. Or even better, out of country. Okay, can I have my wallet back please? I think it's under the chair. Sure. What are you doing? Can you undo these please? You know there's a few things you can't finesse a teenager on. You can fool us about a lot of things. But there's a few things a teenage girl knows more about than almost anyone. You know what those things are? Fake ID's. David Cook, Joey Montichollo, Jocyln Gardnell. Do you even know who this kid is? Maybe trust a murderer but never trust a thief. What are you doing? Please! Please, please, please, please, please, please, please. I promise, please, please, please I'm so sorry, please, please. Told you I don't like fucking liars. Please, please, please, please, please. You were so close, Mark. So fucking close you could probably taste it. I'd feel bad for you but I see a good side to this. We can finally have some fun. Please. You really are a pussy. So tell me, if the whole son story was all bullshit then why'd you break in here? Drugs. Speak up bitch. Drugs. To pay for drugs. All right, we're done talking now. Well, you're done talking now. I'ma do whatever the fuck I damn want. I have an idea. I think you're gonna like it Mark. Where are you going? Where are you going? Mark, did you just choke on your own blood? I'ma save this for later. What? What? What was that? I can't hear you, what? Oh, you made me really mad, Mark. Oh yeah, that's not even your actual name. It's okay, I'll keep calling you that if you don't mind. It's funny. I don't even know your real name and yet I still feel kinda close to you. Funny how we use names to describe things. When really, those names have nothing to do with those things. For example. You obviously know this is a hammer, right? But the part of the hammer that I used to hit you is called the face of the hammer. And I hit you in the face. What? I still can't hear you Mark. I wish I could, but I can't. Anyways, what was I saying? Oh yes, the face of the hammer. So this is the face, let's go a little deeper. Do you know what this part is called? Mark, you're not even trying to play. I'm really disappointed in your lack of participation. It's called the cheek. No one can hear you Mark. Sound is really isolated here, kinda freaky. Look, I'll even scream with you, okay? Help, help! Somebody please help! Hmm, yeah. Nobody's coming Mark. Now where was I? Oh yeah, the cheek. Oh shit, fun's over. What the fuck happened in my house? We gotta clean this shit up and quick. This is getting messy, real fucking sloppy. Thomas, we are not killing him in my house. We live here. I thought we were done with all this and now it's starting all over again. Thomas, untie him, we need to get him into the car right now. - The sun is coming up. - Okay. Dragging a bloody man from your house into your car isn't the most discrete thing in the world. We need to get rid of him quick. I'll put on my jacket. Ashley, you're not coming. You've enough for one night, we'll talk in the morning. Mom, please, you might need my help. We're just gonna take him to the lake, do what we gotta do, nothing we haven't done before. We'll be fine. Thomas, I'm gonna get the car ready. Mom, can I just talk to you for second please? I'm sorry I didn't tell you that he was lying. You should have called us. We're in a rush, but listen. It could've been a trap, instead you do this and now we're cleaning up your mess again. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Look Ash, we have to do this now. But if you want, we can talk as soon as I come back, okay? You better not have any stupid ideas going through your head. When we get outside, you so much as look at someone the wrong way, I will slice your ear, oh for fucks sake. What the fuck is it now? For god's sake. For fucks sake you ugly motherfucker, get the fuck up, the fuck is wrong with. Go! Stay here. Merry Christmas you mother fucker.
