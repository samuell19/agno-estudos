Narrator: In 1431 A.D., in the reign of King Borommaracha Thirat II, the Kingdom of Ayothaya has seized the territory of Sukhothai and has expanded its power across the highland to the East. After a seven-month siege, Ayothaya captured the divine city. One year and three months later... (thunder rumbling ) (whinnies) ( shouting ) Take care of yourself, young master. Shoot! ( labored breathing ) ( thunder crashing ) Get the boy. ( Birds chirping ) Hey! Stop! ( Shouting ) (growling ) Hey! Come down quickly! Hurry UP- Hey, come down! Not going, are you? Let me go! Let go! Let go of me! Get up here. Let go of me! - Little troublemaker, huh? - I said, let go of me! ( Screams ) Make sure he's the next one. - Let me go. - Get up. Go. Go. ( Chanting ) ( breathing heavily ) ( laughs ) He's the next fighter. ( laughing ) I will give you a chance, kid. Let's see if you can make it out alive. (yelling) ( screaming ) - ( gasping ) - ( chanting ) Begin. ( Gasps ) ( roaring ) ( screams ) (grunts) - ( roars ) - ( screams ) ( groans ) ( panting ) Your life is in your own hands, kid. ( Panting ) Tien. Young master. Get away. It's because of you. Traitor. I want to be a great warrior like my father. How long will you be away? - I hate you. - Give him to me. Father... (thunder rumbling ) (groaning ) Is this the boy? That's right, Father Sengpa. The way he looked when he was fighting, reminded me of someone. Even the spirits don't dare touch him. He has a powerful destiny. Whenever he holds a weapon in his hands, he can conquer the world. I'm Chernang, the king of the outlaws here at Garuda Wing Cliff. I was impressed by your courageous fight with the crocodile. If you want to train in the way of weapons and martial arts, you can stay here. But if you don't, I will not stand in your way. ( Explosion ) ( laughs ) Chernang: Unite your body and soul. Fuse the rules of fighting. Set your mind on the path of power. That is what you have to accomplish. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses. Short or long. Sharp or blunt. Soft or hard. Heavy or light. Weapons are the tangible form of power. Anyone who can fuse his body and soul with them shall possess the greatest power in the land. The world will bow down to your strength. I am Chernang, the outlaw king at Garuda Wing Cliff. I've given you a new life. From now on, always remember... you are one of us, the outlaws of Garuda Wing Cliff. (grunts) ( trumpets ) ( trumpeting ) ( bellows ) ( bellows ) ( bellows ) ( shouts ) ( bellows ) ( trumpeting ) The test of agility and wit. Tien has passed. Next, is the test of martial arts. (grunts) ( rings ) ( shouts ) (grunting ) ( shouting ) ( screams ) ( laughs ) That's what I'm talking about, my son! Chernang: This place will test the power of your mind. Woman: Help me. Let me go. Help me. Help Help me. Don't be afraid. I'm here to help you. I'll get you out of here. Come with me. I'll help you. Don't be afraid. ( Hisses ) (growling ) ( hisses ) ( growls ) (growling ) Your life depends on yourself. To kill someone, to be merciless, is the last thing a leader must learn. Father Sengpa: My people, my children! The spirits in the sky have written that the great black-tusk shall become the king of all elephants. This sacred animal will bring prosperity to this community. ( Cheering ) Hooray! Now... I, Chernang, hereby proclaim that from now on, in all the raids, Tien will replace me as the leader. ( Cheering ) Hooray! ( Cheering ) ( horses whinny ) ( shouting ) ( roaring ) Why haven't you taught me the art of weaponry? Young Tien: I don't want to study the dancing arts. I don't want to go. I want to stay with you. You have to study so you'll grow up to be a great man. Believe me. (thunder rumbling ) Pay respect to Master Bua. You've traveled so far. Let's go inside. It's been more than three months since Ayothaya took control of the vessel states. The situation in the capital is still in disorder. But the Crown Prince is behaving impetuously. He has ordered me to suppress resistances in the protectorate territories. Why is Ayothaya in such a rush to expand its power? Why didn't Lord Rajasena, chief of the royal army, oppose the Crown Prince? Everything was Lord Rajasena's idea. Power is terrifying. But those who abuse power are even more terrifying. This land will burn. People in every corner will suffer. In this time of uncertainty, there is only you in this distant land to whom I can entrust my son's life. Master Bua, I feel like my heart has been pulled out. May you take pity on me and take care of him. Master Bua: I will try my best. You take care of yourselves as well. Muen Sri. Luang Krai. Take us back. Yes, sir. My name is Pim. I'm an orphan. Master Bua has raised me since I was a baby. How about you? My father is Lord Sihadecho, one of the four commanders of the East. I told my father I want to study weapons and martial arts. I want to be a great warrior like my father. I don't understand why he sent me here to study dancing. How can I fight anyone then? ( Imitating flute ) Hoarse flute. ( Rattling ) Hey! Ooh, itchy. Scratching your balls too? No, I'm not itchy. Why are you scratching? I have it too. The same. Throw it up. Oh, throwing it up too. Turn around, around, around. He's gone. Oh, he's really gone. Gone. ( Sizzling ) Tien, do you think being a master of weapons can bring peace to the land? I think that weapons can help me protect myself, assist righteous people, and fight treacherous people. That should contribute to bringing about peace. Well said. Tien, there are various kinds of weapons in the world. Which ones do you wish to study so you can help your homeland? ( Chuckles ) You don't have to answer me right now. Hey, take it. ( laughs ) (gongs) Let the slave trade begin. (wailing ) Hey, come here. Let me go. Mother! - Hey, come here. - Let me go. My son! My son! Go! My son! My son! Mother! Mother! Mother! ( Groans ) (whimpering ) ( screaming ) Who the hell? Was it you? Was it you? You want to drink? Drink it! ( laughing ) (grunts) ( screaming ) ( groans ) ( laughs ) ( shouts ) ( snapping ) (whimpering ) ( screaming ) (whimpering ) Please spare my life. I don't want to die. I have money. I have slaves. Whatever you want, you can have it. Good. I'll give you a chance. The same one you gave me... Throw him to the crocodiles! Huh? No! I don't want to die. I don't want to die. (wailing ) Release all the slaves. ( Sobbing ) You saved my life. Thank you so much. ( Cheering ) ( drums playing ) Pim: Tien, how long will you be away? Are you really leaving, Tien? Who will play with me if you're gone? I won't let you go, Tien! Tien, don't go! Don't you worry. I'll be back soon. Hurry, young master. We don't have much time. I have to go. Tien. ( Rattles ) Why are we in such a hurry? Luang Krai! Where are you taking the young master? How dare you betray the commander? Traitor! ( Shouts ) Run, young master. ( Shouting ) (woman sobbing ) You! Let me go! Let me go now. I need to see my husband! Don't do this to me! Let us go! My husband! (woman wailing ) ( laughs ) Let me go. ( Muffled screams ) I'll send you to serve your master in hell. Rajasena. You bastard traitor! Kill him. ( Shouting ) ( laughs ) Father... Get him. Take care of yourself, young master. Shoot! ( labored breathing ) Get the boy. So, you have made up your mind. The day I met you at the crocodile pit, you reminded me of someone. That someone was me, when I was young. That day... your eyes were sun-parched. But they were shining brightly with flames of anger. Even today, those flames are still shining in your eyes. Actually, I was going to make you the Outlaw King today. But since you have something on your mind, you shall go and finish it first. Inn: and everyone at Garuda Wing Cliff... will be waiting for your return. ( Horse whinnies ) ( drums beating ) Honorable governors, ministers, royal advisors, and commanders... now is an auspicious time destined by heaven. As the first monarch of the Garuda Deva dynasty, I shall commence the holy ritual to pay homage to the divine monument. It shall eternally stand as the symbol of power of the Garuda Deva dynasty. ( Drums beating faster) ( screaming ) ( groans ) This is for my mother. Guards! This sword is for my father, Lord Sihadecho. ( Groans ) Guards! ( Screaming ) ( shouting ) Father Chernang! I have returned. ( Shouting ) ( gasps ) ( panting ) ( screams ) ( groans ) (coughs) ( men shouting ) (yelling) ( shouting ) ( panting ) ( bellows ) ( rumbling ) ( Caws ) ( screams ) ( Caws ) ( Caws ) ( bellows ) ( panting ) My blood is not for your sword to drink. You don't have to waste your energy, my guards. I have someone who has been waiting to kill you. ( laughs ) Now, the clan of Sihadecho has been wiped out. The only one left is his son. He is standing right there. Now, you shall hurry to finish what you still owe me. Father. A king shall never go back on his word. Your Majesty must keep your promise and spare the lives of my people whether I live or die. The man in black in front of you is the one who killed your father. Kill him. Kill him... ...if you can. ( laughing ) Rebel! Your clan deserves to be exterminated. Had I known you were one of them, I would have finished you off long ago. ( Shouting ) I was the one who slashed your father's throat. ( Shouts ) Let me repay your father's life with mine, my dear son. Chernang. Take him away. But don't let him die too easily. Torture him. Put him through the kind of pain he deserves. Make sure he suffers until his last breath. Narrator: Tien's life has come to an end because of his cursed karma. But if we could unite the power of our minds, our strength of faith might be able to prolong his life and guide his tormented soul back to his body. SubRip: HighCode
