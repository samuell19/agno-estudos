The money's not all here. You'll get the rest when you finish the job. Isn't this your husband? Yes. Now what do you need? That hurts! You are killing me! Oh, Please God! It seems to me you've furnished everything I need. His big kick is flying solo? Yes. Very interesting. Power to XL709. Stand by for go ahead. You love the water, don't you, Pong? Damn! I'm losing altitude. It's gone berserk. All's well that ends well. The police have finished their investigation. Verdict? Victor's death was an accident. Yesterday the will was read. He left everything to his daughter, but I was named executor. And Livia's guardian until she comes of age. I feel so free. Now I can settle some accounts. I'll show that junior partner of his, Robert. He thinks I'm nothing more than a whore. I'm going to ruin him. Excuse me, mister. Hell no. I kind of like being close to you. Hey, come on. I mean it. I want to see you, but that kid keeps staring at me. What did I tell you? She's jealous of you. So what's it to me? Nadio's following me. He wants more money. Hello, Robert. - I can't tell you how sorry I am, Emmanuel. My deepest sympathies. Hello, Ilona. You okay, Livia? - Do you know where you'll be staying? - Not yet. I don't think you'll have any trouble. Robert, we're going to a hotel. I thought you'd be going straight out to the house. - It reminds me too much of my husband. - What about Livia? She and I will meet you tomorrow. I'd be so happy to assist you. - I'll see you tomorrow at the office. - Whatever you say. Come along, Livia. You're nervous, Emmanuel. You shouldn't have talked like that. You were very mean. I don't need your advice, Livia. Emmanuel, I'd much rather go straight home. You'll do as I say. I'm in no mood to be home with your father's photographs and Ilona following me everywhere. Breathing down my neck. You can't fool me. That's not it. That's only part of the reason. They made the set up sound real good. So here I am. Oh, you haven't told me a thing about you. Are you Italian? Yeah, I am. I'm from Bergama. How about you? Where are you from? I'm Athenian. I was offered a job in a classy nightclub. You'll come and see me, I hope. We're almost there. Excuse me. This is where I want to get out. Take care. You too. I'd like you to take this. The bags to the room. Here we are, Livia. Just a minute. Have you checked number 4? Yes sir, I looked over her this morning. And what about 10 B? Some of the boys were in a hurry and overloaded it. I'm sorry about that. - The Night Gang? - Yeah Well, you'll have to tell your crews to watch it. Thanks, Steve. Hello? Thanks. Well, they're staying at the Amantis Hotel. I wonder what she's up to? I think she's upset, that's all. - I'm not so sure. - What then? I don't know yet, but that's not what I'm worried about. Now, Emmanuel controls Livia. She'll influence the girl. And while Emmanuel wasn't left anything outright, she's the new boss now. Yeah. Maybe Emmanuel is not as smart as you think. She wants revenge. I know, but there's got to be some way out of this. But anyhow, we've got to find a way to win the kid over to our side. Okay. You give me some ideas on how to begin. I'd say everything considered, you've got a very good chance. Think, Ilona. No, no, please. Livia, try to understand. I never loved your father. He knew that. He only married me because I always did what he wanted. But if I'd known how far he could go, I'd never have married him. He was a dangerous man. I pampered all of his vices. And in return he took good care of me. I liked the lifestyle. You can't understand if you've never ever been poor. Have you nothing to say to me Livia? You can say anything you want about my dad, because I've always despised him, but you are same as he was. I want a room. I need all the rooms for my girls. I'll pay you in advance. Then give me a week's rent. Right now. That's okay. This ain't no posh hotel. - Give me the key. - Take any room you like. They're all open. There's nothing to worry about. I keep an eye on my girls. Hey, they don't include breakfast and there ain't no shower. And just let me know if you want to get laid. You go on. You must be Mrs. Brindisi. Two Windsor. I'm glad you came, Mrs. Brindisi. Relaxation is the best medicine. And if I'd known that you were in the mood to go out tonight, I would like to have invited you. That's very kind. But I never go out with strange men. Well, I'm not really a strange man. I'm an old friend of your husband's. Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea. No, it's me who's sorry. You'd be surprised how much you meant to your husband. And now that I've met you myself, I think I can understand why. Oh, you needn't say those things. I just thought you'd like to know, that's all. Well, if there's anything you want to do, just ask me. No, please. I mean it. Thank you very much, Mr. Snow. Call me Tom. Miss, may I? Yeah, my name's Livia. Is it all right if I sit down? My name's Mike. I've never seen you before. You must be new around here. Dance with me again. Come on. No, I want you to sit right here and talk to me until your friend comes back. She's not my friend. She's my legal guardian. Are you on vacation or do you live in Cyprus too? My stepmother's just here on business. In that case, we can meet again. I'd like to know you better. May I sit down? Oh, I'm sorry. I was just going anyway. Perhaps we'll see you again. - Yeah, bye Livia. - Bye. Why are you pulling such a face? You always say the wrong thing. What did I say? All I wanted was my place back. It wasn't that. It was the way you said it. Well, don't worry. I won't ever do it again. It doesn't matter because I'll never see him again. Don't worry. I know how difficult love is. That's the new conveyor belt. Was that necessary? We're always ordering new machinery around here. You should have asked me first, Robert. From now on, you're not to do anything without asking me. All right, Mrs. Brindisi. But I'd like you to know that your late husband always let me make the decisions about the workers and the plant. I'm in charge now. Don't do anything without me. We also need some additional workers. - How many? - Twenty. Fifteen will do. Robert, by the way, I want the house ready by tomorrow. - What? - Get it ready. Let's go, Livia. You'll have to handle it, Ilona. Should I put away Brindisi's photographs? Leave everything as is. - Mrs. Brindisi. - What is it? If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you something, Mrs. Brindisi. Could you tell me more about your husband's death? The verdict was accidental. I thought you could tell me something about the accident. Good day, Robert. I think she knows more than she's telling us. I'm going to get that whore Oh, look, Livia. - It's very pretty. - Do you like that? Hey, that's your color. Think so? Well, suits you. - Keep it. - Thanks, mister. This car is really solid. You hear that? Now there's a door that really works, like in the old days. - Just look. - Marvelous. That interior, it's absolutely gorgeous. The best that money can buy. This is a car you can really enjoy. Let's go in. May I help you? Yes, we'd like to see tablecloth, please. Right this way. We have a large collection. - Why don't you take a look around? - Thank you very much. Livia. Please, take your time. I love your hat. Good afternoon.Hello. You know, we met before. You remember, don't you? Oh, yes, you're the man who sat across from me on the plane. You were with somebody. In a way. Hold still. Like that. It looks perfect on you. You're a very pretty little girl. You know that? Oh, thank you. But I'm not really so pretty. It's too soon to tell. Well, I can tell and you're beautiful. Tell me, do you buy a fresh Rose every morning? I certainly do. Remember, a Rose smells sweetest when it's fresh. Are you visiting or do you live here? I'm on vacation. That's nice. I think it's funny meeting you again like this. I'm glad. We can be friends. Would you like my Rose? This should be fine for you, Livia. Do you want to try it on? You know, he was on the plane with us and we recognized each other. Well, isn't that a coincidence? - Good day. - See ya. I'd like to see him again. I can't permit that. - I'm sorry. - Oh, please. But it's just someone we met, that's all. - Open the dress. - Let's see it. - Later. - Why not? Back in the hotel. We'll open it together. Let's go. I can't wait to get back to the hotel now. Hello beautiful. You've been pretty scarce. Yeah. And I want a friend. May I have a scotch? Yeah, sure. One more. Here's to you. Cheers. You can come home with me tonight. I've thought a lot about you. No kidding. You really turned me on. You go ahead, baby, I'll follow you. Well, I was really lucky to find this apartment. Make yourself at home while I slip into something more comfortable. I'm just about out of everything, but I've got eggs. I think there's enough for you, though. You hungry? I'm coming. And if you want to wash, the bath, then you're right. Thanks. Here's some beer in the fridge. Sorry, it's not a very good brand.That's all I could get. I haven't got anything else, but at least it's something to drink. Yeah. Eggs almost ready? Mm-hmm. Let me just get the machine going. Hm? Talk louder, the line's bad. I can hardly hear you Ilona. What? Call me when they come in. And listen, Ilona, there's one more thing. If Emanuel wants you to change anything around, don't do it, don't move a thing, all right? Yeah. Now, I want her angry. I want to crack that cool exterior of hers. I want her so upset she'll give herself away. I'll be waiting. Bye-bye. Now, John, what was that about Tuesday's shipment? - Welcome home, Emanuelle - Hello, Ilona. Hi, Livia. - Hello. - Come right in. Come, Livia. How are you? Get rid of those photos. You didn't have to throw it like that. And besides, this is my house, and those photographs are all I have left of my dad. - Do as I say. - He was still my father. I'm sorry I had to do that, Livia, but you just won't understand. I'm your guardian now, and trustee of your fortune. So you will do what I say. Keep your hands to yourself, Ilona. I hate you. You make me sick to my stomach. Livia. Bastards! Oh, no, please. Who sent you to us? Hey, hold still. A fat lady sent me. You come highly recommended. Let's see what you can do. Now I want you to show me everything you know. Wait! Why were you running away? I wasn't, I was just playing. I think I ate a bit too much. The lamb was divine, don't you think? Mm, and the rice. Excellent. Oh, superb. Oh, thank you, Vanessa. I didn't like it. Robert, do you remember how Frank used to drag girls down to the basement? That's how I met Brindisi. They were old friends and one was worse than the other. My mother used to wait for him with a broom in her hands. And he would make a beeline for my room, drunker every time. And I was waiting for him, washed and brushed and ready. Do you think you ought to say that in front of his child? Well, I suppose I shouldn't. But all I remember about those years is how I felt hungry. I would have done anything for a crust of bread. My mother was a laundress and my father was a drunk until the day he died. But if you don't like it, why don't you just go? Good evening. I think I need some wine. Well, I'm sorry if I behaved unpleasantly. I'd like to apologize to you all. My husband's junior partner was so ridiculously loyal. I made up that story just to annoy him and I succeeded. I'm happy to say the faithful watchdog has left us. Dear Tommy, from today I think it would be a nice idea. if you discussed all business arrangements with me and help me decide. Emmanuel, you're a wise girl.You can talk business with me. We'll discuss anything you like. Your husband and I were friends. I'd very much like to offer that friendship to you, my dear Emmanuel. I'm ready to aid you in any way you like. Thank you, Tommy. I'll do anything for you. I may take you up on that. It's a pleasure. I love flying. It's a fantastic feeling. Thanks for inviting us, Mr. Snow. Look over there. Pretty as a picture. What a nice way to see the island. Once around and home. - Like it? - I love it! My great thrill. It's a passion I can see a mountain. Tommy, look down there. Oh yeah? The villiage there. - How beautiful - Livia look, we are ... Welcome, Mr. Snow. Thanks, Yannis. My guest's bags are in the boot. Hit the button. I love these old things. They're so graceful. Just think some of these amphora date back to hundreds of years before the birth of Christ. Makes one feel rather humble, don't you think? I'm very proud of my collection. This kylix of this amphora and this one were found near here. Oh, and this one. You're a fortunate man. Oh, and then over here. These are more recent acquisitions. And you have variety. I'm especially proud of this one and of this one. They're really incredible. Yes, they are incredible. They're so beautiful. Yeah. And beautiful objects last forever. I'm afraid all this is tiring you. Would you like to go out with me after dinner to see the sights tonight? Would you? I asked you. Shall we confirm it? Just you and me. Well, Livia, did you find anything interesting? This doesn't look Greek. Watch out, it'll bite you. Come on, if you want to rest or wash your rooms already. Emmanuel, I'll show you your room. Hey, I wasn't expecting you today. You could have called first. I don't believe in phoning ahead. I drop in. I'm glad you're here. I'll go make you coffee. I hope you like Greek coffee.When it's thick and sweet, it's the best. You just have to wait a little longer to drink it. And what if I don't want to wait? Oh, Mario, you have to. - How long am I supposed to wait? - Just a couple of minutes now. It's got to boil. I'm not a man who waits. It doesn't look right, that's all. With your knowledge, you're the only one who can find out if that crash was an accident or not. OK, I understand. You want to find out if it was a malfunction or if that plane was tampered with. - Yeah - OK. I'd like to share all this with you. Let me think about it, Tommy. I need a bit of time. I never expected to meet someone so soon. Let's leave it like this for a while. Now I need your help and your friendship. Love will come later by itself. Whatever you say, I can wait. By the way, Livia's going out. - Where's she going? - Mike's coming by to take her out. Don't worry about it. They'll have a good time. I wish you would. I want you to relax here.OK, will you try? Excuse me, is this the way to the Snow residence? Yeah, straight up this hill and to your left. - Up the hill then left. - You can't miss it. Thanks. - Livia! - Hi! Hurry up, jump on the back. I'm so glad you came I love this bike. I love it! You know, I've never been on a motorcycle before. Hold on tight. I've been thinking about your offer to buy Robert out of the factory. Have you made up your mind yet? Yes, but I'd like to sign the contract here on Cyprus. With my lawyers present. I don't trust Robert. What have you got against him? He's too inquisitive. You've become very smart, Emmanuel. I learn, Tommy, quickly when I have to. Well, you're a very fast study, my dear. You know more about business than most businessmen. I had to be, living with Brindisi. And that's just why I want you to stay with me. As my wife.If you want to, you can manage my business as well. Don't mix business with marriage. Emmanuel, I know now that I love you. Please, let's wait a bit more. Maybe when I come back. I will think about it. Tomorrow morning I'm going back to the city. I probably won't come back until I know. Okay This shell is my first present to you. Thank you. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. - Here you are. - Thanks. Well. Are you having a nice time? I believe this is one of the nicest days I've ever spent. But you said you'd give me a little more time, remember? Let's just lie back and enjoy it. I remember. But you are now the whole world to me. You're reckless. - But I can't afford to be. - Put some oil on my skin, please. It wasn't an accident. It was Mario Infante. Here. Watch it. He's dangerous. Take care. May I help you? - Is Mrs. Brindisi at home? - She's not in right now. When do you expect her? Just a moment, I have to answer the phone. She's not here now. She went away for the weekend. And what did you find out? That means Brindisi really was murdered. I believe it's time we called the police.Yes, of course. He's the killer. Okay, I got it. Mario Infanti. Yes, I know. And I'm to wait here until you phone later. Yes, okay. So long, bye. This is Brindisi's out. Who should I say was here? I'd like to ask you a question. Who was that you were talking with just now? Who was it? Who are you to ask questions? It doesn't concern you. Hey, come back here. Who was that on the phone? You answer me. Okay, we'll see if you like water. No, no, no, no. Tell me, who was that on the phone? Come on, who was it? Who? No, please. Who was that on the phone? Who was that on the phone? - Robert. - How does he know me? He doesn't. He only knows you with a name. What did he say? He said the crash wasn't an accident. Then what? He figured she did it. Emmanuel. Don't tell him I was here. Okay? I don't want to hurt you anymore like this. Don't worry. Come on, baby. Like that. Like that. Thank you, Mr. Snow. I had a wonderful time. I'm glad, Livia, and I want you to come again. Hear that, Livia? Can I really? Of course. Safe home. Tommy, you're wonderful. Drive carefully, Yannis Yes, sir. Emmanuel, just let me know when you have everything arranged, and I'll be there with the money. The deal will come off just as we planned, and Robert be out of the way. I knew I could count on you Thomas. Okay, Janice. I ordered the wine and had all the linens changed. Did anybody come by while I was away? Yes. A man did come by. Who was it? Well, he... Ilona, I'm waiting. Well, he said to say Mario. Mario? I don't know anybody by that name. He'll call later. Would you like your bath now? Yes, Ilona. Run it for me. Yes, certainly. I'll be glad to. And there were no other calls? Will lunch be ready soon? Yes, right away. Ilona, where's Livia? Livia, sometimes you're the limit. You should have told me that you were going out with Mike. I wouldn't have objected. I suppose I still think of you as a little girl. But there's no doubt. You've grown up. If you have to go and fall in love, the least you can do is invite your boyfriend to the house. From now on, you and I will be good friends. Mike, Emmanuelle figured it all out. I'm so pleased she understands about us. Wait a minute. Uh-oh, I think I hear her coming. Just a minute. Mike, don't go away. Just hold on a minute. Mike? Yes, I'm back. It's all right. Can we go for a ride on your bike? Oh, good. Good night. You agreed to back Mrs. Brindisi the loan of $50,000 in advance. I'm convinced that Mrs. Brindisi is of excellent risk.Wouldn't you say so? Robert should be glad to get it. Oh, yes. I'll put a spanner in the works if he doesn't agree. I can easily cut down his share and he'll be forced to pull out. Oh, I fully expected you to do that. My friend Brindisi made a big mistake of putting you in charge much sooner. I'm getting there, Tommy. How much did you say? $50,000 now. Thank you, Tommy. You're much cleverer than most men. No, I'm not. I'm richer. - Look at that vault. - I think giants live here. Maybe they just thought they were giants. - Like to climb that tower? - I bet it's cool inside. - Spooky. Hey, wait up. Right up there. Hold still. Livia, sit on the step. Here. I never take good pictures.. - Madame? - Thanks. Right this way. - What are you lost? - No. Well, honey, if you're looking for work, check in the office. No, I'm looking for someone named Mario. Mario. Mario. You bet. Big guy with long hair. Yeah, that's him. He's got a lot of savoir-faire, joie de vivre. Ain't that right? Has he booked a room in this hotel? What's it worth to you? Everybody wants a handout. This is more than you make in a day. It's the first room on the left. - But I ain't seen him for three days. - That's bad. Tell me, before he left you did he leave his key? I never gave him a key. You know what you can do. Walk right in. Door ain't locked. Well, that's just marvelous. I, uh... Why'd you come here? Emmanuelle said to locate you. She wants to talk to you, that's all. And you're an unexpected treat. Give it to me, I'll open it. - Come and get it. - Livia. We've become a happy family. I think you're right. I hope we'll be happy like this always. Ilona, why don't you make some coffee, then I'll read the ground. All right. More wine, Mr. Snow? Thank you. I'll read your cup first. You have beautiful grounds. It's all falling into place. But it's all going to be nice. There's a girl. And I think I see. A wedding. Fairly soon too. Oh, I think that must be my cup. No, no, no, it's mine. Keep reading. There's some kind of problem. But I don't understand. I don't believe in that type of thing. I'm going for a walk. Come on, Livia, let's go. Mike! Mike! Mike! Where are you? Mike? Mike, are you in there? Livia? Mike? It's not funny Livia? Livia! Mike? Where are you? That's what you wanted, wasn't it honey? Good shot! Point game and set. I think you won. I think I lost. It's cold! You're right. Come on, I'll rub you down. Can anyone feel it? Turn around. Oh, you're beautiful, your just beautiful I've had it, it's too cold. Emmanuel! What happened? She was attacked. We were playing in the ruins. A man grabbed Livia and raped her. I fought with him, but... It was the man from the plane. The one with the roses. He's a monster! Who is it? Alright, just a minute. Livia, I wish I knew. - There's nothing... - Emanuelle, it' s for you - But Livia... - But Mr. Snow, I just don't want to talk about it anymore now. Please. Alright. You just take it easy. Uh-huh. I'm okay. I'll be okay. Good girl. Are you really alright? Uh-huh. But the police are convinced it was an accident. Something told me it wasn't. I figured it out on my own. And I'll prove it to you. Emmanuel hired a man to booby-trap his plane. Incredible. That's absolutely amazing, Robert. I'll show her. She can't get away with this. The killer himself gave her away. And for a very good reason. You know what it is? But of course. Why would she kill her husband just to be blackmailed? That's right. We're almost there. It's the next street. I can't wait to see her face. I don't know, Mike. Where's Emmanuel? - She's out. - What? I called earlier. I was told she'd be here. - She had an appointment. - When? What's this stuff about an appointment this evening? Is it with Mario, the Rose Man? Is it? What? The rapist? Rapist? You crazy? Emmanuel paid the man to kill her father. Hold it a minute. Maybe I know where she went tonight. It seems to me I overheard the words. Something about the amphitheater. Yeah, I think that's what she said. I'll call the police. Come on. Let's go. Hello, Emmanuel. You wanted more than you were worth. I'm worried about something, Emmanuel. It concerns you and me. What's that? It's Robert. He's making inquiries. You better be careful. I think I'll stick around and wash the fireworks. You had your fireworks this afternoon, you son of a bitch. You wouldn't begrudge me a piece of tail. I was only breaking in that cute little brat. What's the matter? Son of a bitch.
