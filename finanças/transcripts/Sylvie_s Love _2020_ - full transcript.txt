(laughs): I’m sorry. Why don’t you sit down. Aye, aye, Captain. Come join me. Gosh. You know, I have not sat down all day. Okay. You have my full attention. Oh, God, I didn’t ask you. How’d it go? What is it? I need to go back to Detroit, alone. Do they need you to start right away or something? No. Then I’m not quite sure I understand. I don’t want you to come. What do you mean you don’t want me to come? What do you mean you don’t want me to come? Robert, please don’t do this. I’m not a family man, Sylvie. Help me understand, Robert.
