[soft music playing] [birds chirping] - [police siren wailing] - [crowd clamoring] We're reporting live on the scene in Santa Barbara at a once-a-year party called "Deltopia". Hundreds of college kids have turned violent, - leaving chaos in the streets of Isla Vista. - [booing] We are now seeing what appears to be a standoff. Law enforcement on one side, the angry crowd on the other. [suspenseful music playing] [sizzles] [police siren wailing in distance] - [lighter clatters] - Our last day. Our last fucking day of high school. I can't believe it's finally over. And to think we actually made it without being killed by a school shooter. What are the odds? You know, I always thought you'd be the one to do it. Our counselor told me school shooter doesn't look too good on a résumé. Holy shit! [chuckles] It's your lucky day. Your dream girl's single. Yeah, who? Hannah. Come on, man. It's your chance to get it in! You wanna relax? She hasn't been single for more than ten minutes. Shut up, pussy! You've been in love with this girl since, like, sixth grade. I don't know, man. She doesn't seem that way. It'd be like you dating Ellery. No, it wouldn't. Ellery's way too far up her own ass. No, Hannah's got that too-smart-for-her-own-good, messed-up-in-the-head, vulnerable type of sexy. It's different. I know, but she only sees me as like a friend. So, pull the tampon out of your vagina, and grow some balls. And do what with those balls? Bro, look at Kanye. Kim had him friend-zoned for years. And then one day, he decided to stop being a pussy and start beatin' the pussy. - But, dude, that's Kanye. - Huh? Okay? He's fucking Kanye. Kanye's got gold records. So what? You've got the face of an angel. If you make it to 90, you don't wanna look back and think, "God, I really wish I would have fist-banged that chick back in high school." [eerie music playing] [paper rustling] [sighs] Yo, Ellery. Why'd you post that? It's our last day, Hannah. We need to let the world know that you're single. Come on. My best friend, the smartest, most creative-- second sexiest girl in the school, most badass boss babe is finally free to be my wing woman. You best believe that's breaking news. I can't believe you stayed with him for, like, two years. Yeah. Well, it's been over for a while now. You know, just staying together was a lot easier than breaking up. Baby, you can't let your anxiety hold you back like that. You've come so far. It's not about that. You know, I just couldn't bother to break up with him. Well, it's perfect timing. You're gonna meet so many guys tonight. Mm, no. I'm-- I'm over boys. These aren't boys, Hannah. They're men. They know how to treat a girl. No. You just want a sugar daddy. And suck on old, saggy balls for the rest of my life? Yeah. No, thanks. [inhales] Yeah. - You're gonna lose it. - Why? Are you ready for the best night of your life? Mm. [crowd cheering over cell phone] [scoffs] Holy shit! This is last year's Deltopia. It's the biggest college party in the country. The whole street closes down, and every house in Graeagle has their own massive parties. My sister's best friend throws the best one. And this year, it's Wonderland-themed. Don't worry. I've got you covered. [scoffs, sighs] Yeah, no. I don't know if I'm up for it. El, honestly, I'm... I'm sorry. I just-- I told my mom that I'd spend time with her this weekend. And you know, she's having some, like weird, empty-nest syndrome. You have to come, Hannah. James is gonna be there, and I need your support. He's been texting me, like, literally nonstop. [inhales sharply] Don't make me beg. [groans] - Fine! Fine! Fine! - Yes! Yes! But don't ditch me this time. - I won't. - No, I'm-- I'm serious. That happened, like, one time. And it was Drake's manager. No, no, no. That was a roadie. Whatever. And he got us backstage. Oh. - Pucker up. Come here. - No. - Just a little bit. Stop it. - Mm-mm. [whines] There is my hot mama. All the boys are gonna be like, "Oh, yeah, Hannah. - Single Hannah. I need you now." - No. No, no. - "Hannah, you're so hot!" - Stop! [laughs] - You're hot. - You're going to make me piss myself. [both laugh] - Ugh. - All right. You coming? Yeah. I'll be there. [door opening, closing] - [indistinct chatter] - [Mr. Daniels] Okay. Come on. Take your seats. All right, guys. These are the last of the graded papers that I'll ever have to hand back to you... - Hopefully. - [papers rustling] Well done as usual, Jack. Now, before you move on with your lives... allow me to leave you with this. Stay active. Okay, guys? Don't just sit back and wait for something to happen. Make it happen. 'Cause you certainly can't cross the ocean by just staring at it from the shore. You gotta be willing to stand up for what you believe in no matter what. Because there will be an integral moment in all of our lives where everything that we are and everything that we will become will be defined by that one moment. That profound decision... and what will you do. So, no matter the hand that you are given in life... it really is what you do with that hand - that matters the most. - [paper ball thuds softly] And never let age dictate how you live your life. You're only as old as you feel. [clock ticking] [school bell ringing] [exciting music playing] [music ends] Make sure you all wear sunscreen this summer, okay?

You hear Stella broke up with Matt Jacobson? Oh. So, I guess I'm not the only one ending senior year hot off a break up, huh? No. She was only with him for his followers. She's so thirsty, it's pathetic. Did you hear she gave Cody a hand job over Christmas break just to be tagged in that photo? Okay. No. See. That's the problem. A woman strategically growing her following which may someday become a career gets called thirsty and pathetic by the females who should have her back. All the while, the dude gets praised and idolized by his boys. So, you're saying we should sleep our way to the top. No. I'm saying screw the double standard. Challenge the systemic inequalities. You know a woman makes 78 cents every dollar a man makes? A 22-cent gap. Wait. Yo, Justin. Didn't you hook up with Stella? Yeah. Stella? She's the one. - "She's the one." - [both laugh] I've been saving myself for her. What the hell are you doing, man? I'm a samurai. This one is called "the praying mantis". [exhales] [groans] Yo, Bones. You good, bud? - [sighs] - Aw! Don't worry about Bones. I'm sure his mom's welfare check can cover it, right? Shut up, Ellery! Your mom's a whore. Finally, we made it. Yeah. Now, off to college and the real world. Where we can truly make a difference. Hmm. How's the photo series coming? You, uh, capture the soul of suburbia yet? Trying. I don't know. I feel like there's still something missing. [Jack] Yeah, like what? I don't know yet. You know, it kinda feels incomplete. And I know it's just photos, but you know, it kinda means something to me, so... Huh. Didn't you hear? Our little smarty pants is leaving us for New York. I thought you were headed to a school in the UC. Yeah. Me too. Yeah. Uh, I-- I was. But I'm... I'm-- I'm not really sure. Hey. Good for you. Mommy and Daddy must be so proud. I haven't decided anything yet. Anyone can go to college and party for four years. But eventually, you're out of there, and then what? Working a cubicle at some boring desk job, live in debt for the rest of your life? - Fuck that! - Okay, yeah, Bones. What are you gonna do? By the time you guys are out of that prison, I'll be the boss of my own company. [laughs] Yeah, of what? Slacker's Smoke and Skate? I mean, you can't even manage your own life right now. How are you gonna run a business? I'm gonna run the fuckin' planet, Ellery! And you'll still be a high school has-been, braggin' about your glory days, giving handies to the football team. The slut-shaming is getting old, Bones. Hey, Allie. No one asked for your commentary, okay? Oh. Someone's feeling angsty today, aren't we? Okay! [sighs] So, what you guys doing tonight? I don't know. Probably some party up in Santa Barbara. Mm-hmm! Deltopia! What's Deltopia? Only the biggest party ever. Dude, we should mob up. My cousin went last year. Still hasn't recovered. I'm sorry. Who said you douchebags were invited? What the fuck, Ellery? We didn't get an invite? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't think high school boys are allowed. - [chuckles] - Hey, sweetheart. - We're the same age. - [school bell ringing] Whatever. Hannah, let's go. [butt slaps] Lay off the milkshakes, El!

It's just a bunch of frat boys beating each other off. - Are you serious? - Yeah. You're not even gonna consider this? Hannah's going. Look. I'm over it, man. She's leaving. She's gonna go study out east. That's exactly why you need to go. You really wanna go the rest of your life without knowing what it's like to shove your tongue - down her throat? - [zips bag] You're a sick fuck. You know that? Forget about it, man. Oh, look.

Or you could fall madly in love with her. She could fall madly in love with you. And skip out on the East Coast. You never know. I don't know why you're so adamant about going, huh? You hate frat parties. Oh, clarification. I hate those morons, but I will bang their chicks. And I will do their drugs. God, Ellery. My parents would freak if they knew where we were going right now. Please. As if your dad hasn't done his own fair share of partying. I smoked a joint with him and his friends at your Labor Day party. What? No, you didn't. Yes, I did. We went down to the beach and smoked a spliff. His friends were all drooling over me. That's nice. And it's really gross, Ellery. - [Ellery chuckles] - [scoffs] [Hannah] It's really crazy to think about all the drama we put ourselves through the last four years. It's like it doesn't even seem like a big deal anymore. That's because it's not that big of a deal. High school is just a small part of the big picture. We're moving onto better things. Four years at college, and I'll be off to a job at a top PR firm. - [cellphone dings] - Can you check that for me? It's Alex. And, uh, he said his plug couldn't come through, so... Shit. Do you have any hookups? - No. [scoffs] - What about Jack? Ask him. I'm not asking Jack for drugs, Ellery. Please. Why not? Uh... - [laughs] You like him! - No, I don't. I don't! I don't. Really. He's just a friend. You know, and-- and Jack is like marriage material. And you know, he's-- he's not like an end-of-high school-fling. "Marriage material"? Oh, my God. - You really do like him. - No. No. I don't. He's a loser. You know, he's actually-- he's not a loser. You know, he's-- he's-- he's pretty cool. Outside of school, in the real world, he's second-rate. Whatever. It doesn't even matter. Because if I like him, which I don't in that way, he's not worth ruining our friendship over. Okay, got it.

[exhales] Come on. You'll love it. Makes everything feel good. Okay. Maybe like, half, right? [Steve grunts softly] [James sighs] You don't have to.

Don't worry, I think you'll be safe. ["Yes I Don't Play Games" by Riff Raff playing] I guess she's the one. You have no chance with a girl like that. [Justin] Oh, yeah. Wanna bet? - [Jack] Yeah. - [laughs] Okay. Nice moves. - Thanks. - [chuckles] You might wanna tell your buddy to back off her. That's Murray's girl. - [laughter] - It's a free world, man.

That's strike two. - [Bones] I'll cut your ass? - Oh, yeah? You think I'm scared of a dumbass 130-pound little bitch like you? Come on. Let's go, buddy. [Murray] That's what I thought. Asshole. Babe! [Jack] What the fuck was that, huh? You trying to get us killed? I'll slit his fuckin' throat. Why you gotta be so crazy? [scoffs] Are you kidding me? I saved your ass, man. You can't stand up for yourself let alone your friends. Fuck you. [Jack] Hey. - Can I bum a smoke? - Sure. Thanks. Sorry for crowding your space, but... you seemed kinda lonely. Guess you're not much of a mind-reader, huh? I bet I can tell you exactly what you're thinking of. - Go for it. - [lighter flicks] You're thinking, "Who is this tool? And why is he trying to kill my vibe?" [chuckles] Okay. That's very cute. But I knew who you were the second I saw you. Mm, I'm that obvious? You're like the epitome of a teen novel, man. You know, with like, pastel colors, and a quirky font, and you don't even have a dedication, and your dialogue is immature, lacks depth. So, how did you end up here? Honestly? [exhales] For a girl. No way. [chuckles] Her name's Hannah. We go to the same school together or we used to. Today was the last day. Well, did you find her? No, not yet. I don't even know what I'm gonna tell her when I do, though. I wanna-- I wanna tell her how I feel, but... at the same time, I don't want her to like, think I'm some stalker for not telling her a while ago. But do you think she likes you back? Yeah. As a friend. [chuckles softly] Oh. Ouch. The friend zone. Yeah. Well, what makes this girl so special? She's just different, I guess. She's shy, but... secretly so passionate. Mm, she can take these photos that just captures the truth of somebody in that moment. Which is so beautiful. But like, she tries to hide it, uh-- like to fit in, I guess. [sighs] - I'm so stoned. - [chuckles] Okay. Well, you have to tell her the truth. And it has to come from the heart, okay? When guys try to act all cool with this stuff, it comes across so egotistical or pretentious, or... or just desperate. I don't know. I guess it depends if she can see through the bullshit or not, but it's always best to be genuine with this stuff. Okay? And, hey, if she's not into it after you bare your soul, who cares? It's not like you're gonna see her in class on Monday. Yo, let's get out of here. This party sucks. How are we gonna find them? Well, we're looking for a fairy. Oh, you're looking for a fairy? [Bones] Yeah. It's that Alpha Psi Welcome to Wonderland party, AKA sorority slut fest. Amazing. It's really great that we haven't been there all night. - You know where it is? - [Cleo] Yeah. It's right down the street and to the left. Big banner. Can't miss it. [Jack] Thanks. - For everything. - No worries. Good luck, Jack. Wait a minute. I'm not going any further until we take this Molly. We've waited long enough. I'll give you the Molly when you give me the knife. What? No. Oh, my God. Are you serious?
