There was a man who conquered the Mediterranean and obtained all the riches of this world. His name was the Roman Empire. The riches of this world, fame, vast lands? It has been said that the man who obtained... ...it all disappeared one day. And now it?s World War 1. I?m supposed to be fighting the descendants of that Roman guy, but? ...something?s wrong I crossed the border easily with only a stick. This is the first time that I was able to have enough time to eat a Wurst. Even if I spot an enemy, they run off somewhere, ?Am I dreaming? Anyhow, I can?t let my guard down, they must have something up their sleeves. Tomatoes To be continued Little Italy Long, long ago, Italy, who was still a newborn, lived in the Roma Empire. Next to my big brother, France! Along with many other countries. But one day, his grandfather took Italy and left the house. For a while, he lived his life drawing and singing song with his grandfather. Italy was very good at drawing, so his grandfather was delighted. Drawing is so fun! It feels like I?m living in the Renaissance! I want to show France and Holy Roma Empire, And I haven?t met him yet, but I want to show my other big brother too! Man, I want to see them soon. But the next time they met... Become part of the Roma Empire again! Little brother? I?m older than you, aren?t I? They had grown up to be bullies. Wait! Become a part of the Holy Roman Empire! NO!
