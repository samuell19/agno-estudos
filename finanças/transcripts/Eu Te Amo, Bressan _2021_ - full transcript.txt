I... I wanted to write that movie about us. Don't come back with that... Why are you so obsessed with it? It's just a story. Maybe I'm not enjoying how things are working between us Do you want to discuss it now? Whatever... We have to talk about it. It's just a story It's been a while since I've done anything like... You have nothing to tell. - You have nothing to tell! - Don't say that... You know how much I like you. I like you too, but... How long are we going to be this little secret?

Maybe he was right. Maybe I don't have anything to say Isn't life funny? We try to find ways to make things eternal. But the standards are the easiest way to tell a story. Put a mask on reality.

I love you, Bressan.
