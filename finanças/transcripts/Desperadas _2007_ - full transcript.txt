[in Taglish] When he had me, I was still a virgin. But not long after, he broke up with me. But we had a souvenir. Patricia. [in Tagish] Emil was an actor with a sweet tongue. [in Taglish] He made me blush, but our romance was predictable. So I broke it off. The fruit of our romance is Stephanie. [in Taglish] Porfilio was a General and a widower. Loyal to his country, loyal to his girlfriend. We were supposed to get married, but he died. The result of our love is Isabella. [in Taglish] Finally, Antonio was a Jueteng lord turned evangelist. Separated from his wife when we were together but went back to her when he converted. [in Taglish] Our baby is Courtney.

Mom, please take care and don't stay long in the US. Okay. [in English] Bye! [in English] Wow. [in Taglish] Hey. Let's have a toast! -Yay! -Okay. [in English] To our beautiful sister Courtney. [in English] May you always have good health. [in English] Good memories as you grow old. And may you have a lot more money! Wait! I work for the bank. That should be for me. [in English] Peace of mind and tranquility. -Wow! That's a good one! -[in English] Very nice. [in English] Most of all, great sex and explosive climaxes! [in English] Cheers. -[in English] Cheers! Happy Birthday! -[in English] Happy Birthday. [singing in the background] [Patricia, in English] Wow. -What's that? -[laughing] [in English] Russian diamonds. -You are so mean! -[in English] Excuse me! -We'll stay over there. -Okay. Let's sit. [in English] Wait! Wedding alarm! Wedding alarm! [in English] Is this the same guy? [in Taglish] What? Those were three basketball players. [in Taglish] There were five! Wait a minute! Five? Why didn't I know that? How would you know? [in Taglish] Well, you know, you don't even have time to be fashionable. Hey, Vito's here. But that's you. [in English] Oh, honey, that was such a nice performance. [in English] Thank you. [in Taglish] But can you go to the boys first because we're having a girl talk. [in English] No problem. [in English] Happy Birthday, Courtney. [in English] Thank you. You know what, Isabella? You're terrible. [in English] Anyway, Courtney, who is the lucky guy? [in Taglish] He's a basketball player and Rookie of the Year! [in English] Is his name Patrick Reyes? [in Taglish] Yes. What about Patrick? [in English] He was my lover. Didn't he tell you? [in Taglish] He doesn't care to talk about his one-night stands. [in Taglish] Dear, I'm not made for one-night stands. So what's the problem if you share boyfriends! [in English] Oh, well! We are family! [in English] He's not even worth marrying. Why? Because he didn't ask you to marry him? Ugh! He's poor in bed! Stop it, Isabella. [in English] It's Courtney's birthday. Please don't rain on her parade. It's better if she knows what kind of person Patrick is. [in English] And besides, if he loves you, why isn't he here? Because he's talking to Dad. He's that serious with me. [in English] Wow. Why don't you two talk and compare notes! [in Taglish] Isabella, you'll be the love coach! [in Taglish] Hey! I don't need a love coach! [in English] Love coach, love coach! Whatever that is! Apparently, that's the only thing contained in your sex book. So what? [in English] Excuse me. They are called relationship books. [in English] Whatever. I don't care what they're called. [in English] I don't read your stuff anyway. [in English] Well… That's why you're uptight. -[in English] Loosen up, honey! -[chuckles] [in English] Read my book! [in English] I'm not enjoying this company anymore. [in English] Courtney. Courtney, wait! [Margot] Even if my daughters have different fathers and different personalities, I'm proud of them. Because like me, all of them are beautiful. [Courtney, in Taglish] Don’t worry Patrick, I already hitched a ride with Patricia and Dave. [in English] I love you. Bye! [chill out music playing on the radio] [in Taglish] Girl, don't tell me you're still marrying Patrick after all that Isabella told you? Of course! Isabella is just exaggerating things. But why all of a sudden? [gasps] You're pregnant? Of course not! [in Taglish] I'm wild but not stupid. I date five guys at the same time but the romance stays up here. They're really that pathetic! That's why when Patrick asked me to marry him, I said yes so he could move from up here to down there. And I agreed to move in with him tomorrow! [in Taglish] Well, think about it really hard because that Patrick Reyes came to me, introduced himself, and asked for advice. I didn't know if he was serious or if he was just kidding. [in Taglish] What advice? [in Taglish] He has a sexual condition. Priapism. [in Taglish] Priapism? What's that? Is that disease contagious? [in English] Stiffness. [in Taglish] What's that? Is he epileptic? [in English] Or stiffness of the neck? [in Taglish] Stupid! It's the opposite of erectile dysfunction. What is it really? [in Taglish] The flag is always up! -Idiot! -[playful music] [groans] -Hey! -At least it's not contagious. [Patricia] Come on. Let's go. Hurry! -[in English] Hi! -[in English] Good morning! -[Stephanie] Good morning! -Peter! -[in English] Hi! -[Peter] Hi, Aunt Stephanie! -[Taglish] Hi! Good morning. How are you? -Fine! -[in English] It's Courtney. Good morning! -[in English] Hi! -[in English] Good morning, Aunt Courtney! -[shrieks] Hi! [chuckles] [gentle music playing] -[in English] Bye! -[in English] Bye-bye. -You're here. -Hi. -[in English] Bye. -[in English] Bye, Papa. [Margot, in Taglish] I made sure that even if they have different fathers, we're still a happy family, so I made sure that we live in one compound. -[in English] Bye! -[engine revs] [Margot, in Taglish] I made them promise that -even if they are married, -[in English] Bye! they're still going to live in the compound. [Taglish] I successfully convinced them all. [in English] Well, partly successful. [in English] Sofia, your teacher, is requesting a parent-teacher conference? [in Taglish] You should be at the school later, Mommy. [in Taglish] Alexis! Your school bus is here. [in Taglish] Ten a.m.? It's hard to park there. Nanny Truding, tell Sebio to get ready. Ma'am, he's not here. He's in the province. [in Taglish] What? I have no driver? -He'll be back by the end of the month. -[scoffs] -[in English] Bye, Mommy. -[in English] Bye. Prepare your bag. Be careful. [in English] Don't forget the meeting, Mommy. [in English] Okay, I won't. [in English] Hello, Vito. [feel-good music playing] Hey, Chi-Chi. [soft moaning] [soft moaning] [in English] Praise the Lord, Courtney! [in English] Hallelujah! Wait! Wait a minute! What's happening to you? Are you okay? [in English] I talked to your dad! He cannot wait until we get married! [in English] He's a great evangelist! Oh my God! [in English] Before the night ended, I was converted. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi, did you hear that? [in English] There's something wrong! Wait a minute! Converted to what? [in English] To a born-again Christian! [cheers] [in English] Hallelujah! Hallelujah! [in English] Praise the Lord! Ha! [in English] What? [in English] In one step, my life has changed! [in English] I feel free now. I feel so free. [in English] I've given up my worldly life! Mm. Really? [in English] You know you should listen, too. I listened to your Dad. [in Taglish] So what's the status of our relationship now, Patrick? [in English] You know, it's still the same. [in English] We're still gonna get married. [in English] I'm still gonna play basketball. [in English] The only thing that's changed is I won't be moving in anymore. [gentle music playing] -[in Taglish] Enough of our indecency. -[chuckles] What indecency? Hugging, kissing. [in Taglish] Those things. We'll be together after the wedding. Patrick, does it mean that we wouldn't be doing it? Let's stay away from it. -What? -I'm going now. [moans] [screams] Chi-Chi, did you see that? He kissed me on the forehead! -[in English] Patrick, wait! -[Chi-Chi barking] Patrick! Patrick! [moans] Chi-Chi, did you see that? I’ve prepared for it for a long time. And he just kissed me on the forehead? [shrieks] This Patrick is unbelievable! [scoffs] Chi-Chi, what's happening to Patrick? Chi-Chi. [sighs] [Isabella, in Taglish] Oh! I really hate those meetings! I'm so glad you're here. [in English] You know what? Your kid is very smart. -[in English] And your husband? -[in English] I'm a single mother. Oh. [in Taglish] Well, as you can see, Alexis has no problems with her academics. [in Taglish] But hopefully, let's discourage the child to bring expensive things to school. [silly music playing] What. What expensive things? [in Taglish] Alexis is just six years old but she already has a cellphone. [in Taglish] Her watch is expensive and her purse is branded. For me, sir, those things are not expensive. [in English] But still, we discourage them. Because here, in our school, we don't want the children to be materialistic. And they’re kids. They might forget it or lose it. You know. [in Taglish] Don't worry, sir. Alexis is careful. [in Taglish] And if ever those things get lost, don't worry, we won't be charging the school. [in English] Anyway, thank you, sir, and it was nice to meet you. -[in English] Okay. -[in English] Bye. [in English] Come on, Alexis. [upbeat music playing] [in English] Ms. Courtney. -[in English] Yes? -Something's wrong with this. -What's wrong with it? -The model doesn't want to wear it. Really? What's wrong with this? [shrieks] [silly music playing] [in Taglish] Sorry, Pa. Can you please put that away? [in Taglish] But Dad, this is my most popular design! Look! [in Taglish] As I was saying, I like Patrick. [in Taglish] But Dad, why did you convert him to a born-again Christian? [in Taglish] He might be doing it to impress you. [in Taglish] Patrick's conversion was voluntary, Courtney. But Dad, it's so fast! [in Taglish] You know, he’s no longer sweet! No lust! What kind of mouth is that? Dad, lust! [in English] Passion! Lust. You know! How else do you want me to say it? But why, Dad? You were wild when you were young. I regret all of that! I'm a different man now. [in English] Believe me, Courtney. Sex is hotter when a person resists. [in English] If he was born a great lover, he will remain a great lover. [in English] But for a Christian lover, it should never be outside marriage. Whatever, Dad! I don't want no sex! [scoffs] [upbeat music playing] Hey! Why is her make-up taking so long? Hurry up! And you! You lack sensuality! -Put some passion into it! -[in English] Dear Lord. [in English] Please forgive her. [Courtney] Let's do it! Hurry up! Hm! ♪ This ring is a symbol ♪ ♪ Of my love for you ♪ ♪ Please say yes ♪ ♪ I'll take care of you ♪ [gentle music playing] MARRY ME [scoffs] [scoffs] -What's this? -[Taglish] Does that need a translation? Since when did you become a jeweler? [in Taglish] What's this? Five gives? Courtney's getting married. You're the only one left who's not married. [in Taglish] I'm not competing with my half-sisters. But where would our relationship be heading? Why? Does it need a direction? [in Taglish] So it's just like this? Don't you have feelings for me? I have. What do you think? But why like this? Because I don't want to. -Why? -I just don't want to. I can only take this level. What kind of answer is that? [in English] And what kind of timing is this? It's so early in the morning and we're here-- [in English] Now is the right time. [in Taglish] The two of us together. Alexis is with us. We'll take care of her. [in English] You're the family I've always wanted to have. [in English] Sorry, Vito. If you're comfortable with this setup, you can stay. [in English] But if not, then you can go. -[in English] Okay. -Okay what? Where are you going? [in English] I'll go. Well, then take this with you. You can have it. [up-tempo music playing] Ugh! -[in Taglish] Nanny! -Yes, ma'am? Nanny, you can have that! -[in English] Alexis, let's go. -Okay. Let's go! [in English] Wow! I'm getting married! -[in Taglish] Nanny! Let's go! -Yes, ma'am! Hey! I didn't know you have a copy of my book. I was supposed to give you a complimentary book with an autograph! [chuckles] Thank you, but I just saw this so I bought it. Just to show my love and support. Well, I’m not actually reading it. [sighs] You know what? You're a hypocrite. That’s why you and Richard are having problems. [low-tempo guitar music] Well, that's life. [low-tempo guitar music] [Patricia, in English] If your man has a hot bod, then consider yourself lucky. He's built to give you a long night of steamy, grinding… [woman moaning] [in English] But if your man wears pajamas in bed, he's the type whose interests in sex have already declined. And you might have to take action and surprise him with a technique called butterfly flick or the silken swan. [sensual music] [snoring] [moans] -[low-tempo guitar music] -[sighs] [in Taglish] At the center! [in English] Back to the left… Left! To the left! [in English] Right! Right. Center! Go! Hurry! [chuckling] There! I'm coming! Right! [screams] Ouch! Hey! Come here, you! That hurts! Why did you bite me? [in English] You don't love me anymore. What? Stop it! For once, could you please shut up! You're so noisy! It's like you're driving! You always dominate! [in Taglish] You always say to the left, to the right, center. There, there, not there! Yes, like that, great! So why are you complaining now? I'm always like this. Because you're too much! Can you just let me lead? Let me do what I want to do! [in English] We're experimenting, darling. And I… And I am your experiment? [elevator dings] -Nanny. -Ma'am? When somebody calls me, tell them I'm not here. Yes, ma'am. Here's your cellphone, ma'am. Okay, go now. Ms. Verona? The head office of the condo developer sent me. This is about the overdue payment for your monthly amortization. I already sent the postdated checks. I have replaced them. Ma'am, there's a problem with them. That's why we're here. Why do you have to come here? Why didn't you call or send me a notice? Ma'am, we already did. You know, maybe the bank has a problem. [in Taglish] The computer system. Because I already sent those checks. [in Taglish] It would be better if you tell your head office to give back all I've paid you because I'm moving out. [in English] Now, if you'll excuse me. [car door clicks open] [engine starts] [light music playing] [car revs] -[in English] Good morning, ma'am. -Yes, Guard? Ma'am, the office sent a memo. We have to cut the services to all those included in the delinquent list. But I already sent a check. Ma'am, if you want, you can complain at the office. It means I can't get out of here? You can, but we can't remove the gate because that's one of the services that we're cutting. You're locking me in here? No, ma'am. You can go out, but you have to raise the gate yourself. [chuckles] Is that so? [light up-tempo music] [tires screech] -[car revs] -[tires screech] -[in English] Here we go! -[hissing] [upbeat music] [crowd chattering] [in English] What the hell is that? Isn't it obvious? I'm in my swimwear! Look! [in English] You should not be wearing that. I'm a swimwear designer! What do you want me to wear? A gown? [in English] Shorts and a T-shirt! What? I have two dozen of these! And I have 14 thongs! What do you want me to do with them? [in English] Give it to charity! What? [in English] Charity? Why? Do they wear this in Payatas? Do they have a pool? -[in English] Courtney, please. -What's wrong with my clothes? [in English] What are you trying to do, huh? Seduce me? Why? Am I not desirable for you? [in English] Babe, you're desirable, but we're not married yet. Right? -[in English] We're not married yet. -[snorts] It's hard to catch this pious guy's attention. [moaning] [phone rings] [in English] Hello? -[in English] Hello? -[Vito] Isabella. Now what, Vito? [in English] I don't want to talk to you. How much would you charge me just to talk to you? [in English] What? [in English] How much would you charge me for me to talk to you? [in English] Okay. One hundred per word. [in English] Okay, deal. [chuckles] When I left you and Alexis that time, I immediately realized that I don't love you. You made me come here just to say that? I realized too that I’m so stupid to have bought that diamond ring. You're stupid, not because you bought it. You're stupid because you gave it to me. Technically, I didn't give it to you, I just left it. [in English] Four thousand two hundred. -[in Taglish] What is? -Plus two. [in Taglish] You used 44 words. [in English] Times 100 pesos is now 4,400 pesos. That’s how much you’ll pay me. Well, I'm still within budget. The ring I bought for you is worth 350,000 pesos. Get to the point or I’ll really charge you. I realized we're the same. I thought I wanted a permanent commitment. But I don't. What I really want is a companion. [solemn music playing] So? I missed you. But I'm not in love with you. I'm moving out of our unit. I'm going back to our family compound. Do you want to help me move? [Dave, in English] Isn't this too much? Isn't it too early for your son to know the sexual terms? You always leave your books lying around. What do you think of my books? [in English] Pornography? You know what, Patricia? I know I agreed with you, but now, it's not right anymore. Imagine your son uses "vagina" and "penis" in his quiz. As an example of a noun? No wonder his teacher left a note! Read it! [in English] Those are the words for those body parts. -[in English] Good morning, Ma! -Good morning. [in English] Good morning, Pa! -Go eat. -[in Taglish] My son, When the teacher asks you, for example, for a common noun, you can use boat, airplane, house but not penis or vagina. Okay? Because they are not ordinary words. [in English] Will the word "balls" be better? [in Taglish] How about the Tagalog word for it? -[in English] Which is-- -Shh. Stop it. Come here! We have to talk! -Come here. Wait, my dear. -What now? What is it this time? Did you hear what your son said? So what's wrong with the Tagalog term? What's wrong-- [in English] Remember. A person who does not love his own language is more foul than an animal and a rotten fish. Ma'am! Jose Rizal. [in English] Perfect! -Yaya's good! She knows! -[funny music playing] -[in English] Daddy! -Hey! Hello, baby! [in English] Mm. How are you? My baby smells so good! -[in English] Hi, Nick. -Hi. Yaya, why don't you and Alexis order first? Yes, ma'am. [in English] You want anything? [in English] No, thank you. I would like to ask you a favor. To not leave Alexis with me this coming weekend. You have a commitment to your daughter, Nick. I know, but I'm pressured nowadays because Katrina is sick. [in English] She's seriously ill. You have a responsibility to your wife, but you also have a responsibility to Alexis. It's just for next week. [in English] And probably a few weeks more. [in English] Do you know how it feels to be seriously rejected by your own father? I'm not rejecting her. I know I promised that I wouldn't do to Alexis what your father did to you. Let's not include my father in this conversation. I love Alexis. I admit that I was an idiot. It's my fault that we didn't end up together. Otherwise, I wouldn't only be a good father to Alexis but a good husband to you. Why are we talking about that, Nick? [in English] I wanted to be a good husband to my wife now, Isa. She needs me. Now more than ever. You mean you’ll no longer see Alexis? This weekend, she'll be with me, but for the next eight weeks, no. Katrina and I are leaving. We're going to the States for her treatment. [in English] Weird. That's what my father said before he died. Why he rejected me at first, so his wife won't be hurt. Don't forget to keep in touch with Alexis, alright? Alexis, I’m going. I'll pick you up on Sunday, okay? [in Taglish] You're staying with your dad, okay? Yes, Mommy. [Isabella] Nanny, take Alexis inside. Vito, thank you so much. [Vito] No problem. [Stephanie] Oh my God. She's back. Come on. Let's go home. [low-tempo music playing] [in English] The clothes you wear in public say much about who you are in bed. And the type of nightwear that you slip into will determine the kind of evening you have with your man. [in Taglish] Yes. All of them. [mid-tempo music playing] Is there a blackout? [music abruptly stops] There's light. Why are you saving electricity? [in English] You don't like it? You know, what happened earlier was too much. A patient had a breach birth. Her doctor was out of town, so I was the one who attended to her. As it turned out, she had twins. [groans] By the way, I have to go back to the hospital. I have a patient. She’s 1 cm already. I'll just freshen up. [solemn music] Is there a problem? Huh? No! [in English] I'm fine! Blow out the candles. It might burn something. [funny music playing] [low-tempo music playing] Isabella? Isabella! Isabella? [Nanny] Ma'am? Where's your madam? She's in the garden, ma'am. -What's she doing there? -She's "mm"ing. What's "mm"? -Just "mm". -Okay. [door clicks shut] [humming] Isabella. You know, you can't do whatever you were doing before when you were on your own now that you're back here, in the family compound. What I mean is you can't live here together. You're not Mom. [in English] Okay. Can't you see Isabella? This kind of setup is not good for Alexis. Don't worry. Vito doesn't like me. [humming] And I don't like him too. Wait! You don't like each other? Hey, Vito! Don't you like Isabella? Are you not serious with her? -No. -No? -Yes. -Yes? -No. [humming] -Wait a minute. [in English] Okay. Which is which? Can you please repeat the first question? [humming] [in English] Okay. So that it would be clear to both of you, what I mean is you can't live here together if you're not serious about each other. I don't live here. But you slept here last night. No. I left. I just came back here for our meditation exercises. -[Isabella] Don't worry. -[humming] We won't beat you and Richard in making a child. [slow drumming music playing] [laughs] [in English] So you want a gown for Chi-Chi? [in English] Yes, Jodie. [in English] Exactly like yours. -[in English] Absolutely. -Wait. Wait. Wait. -Even Chi-Chi's in a gown? -[Chi-Chi barks] Of course, I’ve been with her longer than you. [in English] So she's gonna be a part of the wedding entourage? -[Jodie, in English] Why not? -[Patrick] Really? [in English] It should be exciting. It's never been done before. What's the problem? She would be like your daughter. We don't have "dog" in our blood. Yeah, right. [in English] You're bringing your best friend to the wedding, right? [in English] Okay. Okay, fine. How will she be part of the wedding invitation? -[in English] Bride's puppy! -[dog barks] -Chi-Chi! -[in English] Oh my God! -[Courtney] Why you! Come here! -[Jodie] Looked what you've done! [in Taglish] My goodness! These aren't even paid for yet! My clients will get mad! [in English] Sorry. They say that it's good luck for weddings when you drop objects, right? And for my fitting forms to be destroyed? [scoffs] [in English] I told you not to bring the dog. I don't care! [in English] Chi-Chi, don't worry. You will have your gown! I'll get my gown, including Chi-Chi's, and I’ll pay for all the other gowns! -It should be fabulous! -You should be! -Fantastic! -It is amazing! [in Taglish] You know, our friendship won't last for 15 years if I don't believe in you. I believe in you! [in English] Ah, waiter. You know, Mandy, if you're thinking of getting a loan from the bank, it wouldn't be a problem. As long as your papers and collaterals are complete. It's my first time applying for a loan, so I really don't know what to do. Don't worry, my friend. You know, my husband is a banker. [chuckles] He'll take care of it. His connections… And if it's successful, I'll take care of your silver wedding anniversary. Really? [laughs] That's still a long time. It might not happen. [music abruptly stops] [scoffs] [in English] I mean… [in Taglish] Who knows. One of us might die early. What's that? It's gross. Why death? [in English] How morbid. You're overreacting. Ew. Mandy, it would be better if you plan Courtney's wedding instead. They need a wedding planner before one of them dies. [chuckling] [chuckles] [screaming] [shrieks] Courtney! -[in English] Did you hear Courtney? -Yeah. -What was that? -I don't know what happened. -Let's go look! -Come! Hurry! Let's see! It's making me nervous. [Courtney screaming] -[screams] -What happened? What happened? What happened? Take me to the hospital! -Why? -Why? Look at me! I gained five pounds! What? -I'm fat! I'm really, really fat! -That's it? Hey! That's okay! [in Taglish] Guys want girls with a little fat! [in English] Oh my God! But I can't get fat! My wedding gown won't fit me! What? Your wedding is still far away! But isn't five pounds enough? You know that when I gain weight, it doesn't stop! What if I grow to be this big? What will I do? Oh my, talk to her! [in Taglish] You know what? You're more than your flab. But Patrick is lean and sexy! And I'm fat! You know what, Courtney? Come here. -Have a seat. -I thought it was something else. Okay, Courtney, you are not fat. Okay? What do you call us? You know, have liposuction instead. Lipo? You know that I'm scared of needles! Okay. This is what you should do. [in English] I will ask Richard to ask his doctor friends if they know of any medication that will make you lose weight fast. -But I still have another problem. -What is it this time? What? This one! Look! [in English] What's that? -Look at it! -You're so vain! I've had enough. [in English] I'm walking out. What's with you? Just prick it. -So annoying. -I have to prick this? [Courtney screams] [upbeat music] [in English] Ma'am, excuse me. Do you have another card? [in English] Oh my God! Why did you cut my card? Didn't you know how much this is worth? It was the credit card company's instruction, ma'am. It can't be used anymore. -I don't care! I don't have another card! -Hey, girl, just chill. -Will you please? -I'm sorry, ma'am! Sit down, okay. Isabella! [Margot] Isabella is really hardheaded. Of my four daughters, she's the most wasteful. She's the stubborn one! Probably because she was the only one who wasn't accepted by her father because of the pressure of her father's children from his first wife [grunts] Isabella was accepted by her dad when he was about to die. So the money she got from her father means nothing to her. Now, what? You're jealous, aren't you? [chuckles] I really love you. [solemn music] You mean you haven't applied for a loan even with your previous businesses? I'm scared of debts. Patricia convinced me that I could do it. Patricia's influence over you is good. Yours, too. Well, let's say she can be pushy sometimes. But you know what, Mandy? I always think that it's hard to have a wife who's famous… [chuckles] …and… has extreme self-confidence. You're popular, too. Well, in the bank where I work… You know. There's so much more to be happy about in your marriage. [in Taglish] Oh, dear, get some more. -It's really for you. -Thank you. -[in English] Your favorite. -Vegetables! [in English] Yes! You can eat this, right? My dear. You're not eating. Don't you like the food? [in English] Of course, I like it. That's why I'm taking my time. Did you know that Patrick is a very thoughtful and lovable son? And even if he grew up in the States, he's very Filipino. And we became born-again Christians because of him. [in Taglish] Well, I hope in your first year of marriage, you will have a baby. Of course. The two of you are prepared to have a baby? [in English] I think so. I already practiced for it. [in Taglish] I took care of Chi-Chi for the longest time. -Don't pick up the dog. -Chi-Chi! [in English] Don't worry. It's a dog. Oh! I can discipline very well. -[stammers] -Patrick. Look! I'm really good! -[in English] Chi-Chi, up! -Cute! -[in English] She got flowers. -Chi-Chi, eat. -[in English] Eat. -Oh my God! -[in English] Very good! -Our utensils! -[in Taglish] Eat some more, Chi-Chi. -Don't worry. -I don't think she bites. -Patrick. Is it always like this? [in English] No, no, no. No, Chi-Chi. -[dog barks] -Eat some more. [in English] Chi-Chi! That's bad! -[dog barks] -It's alright. It's alright. [in English] I'm sorry. [indistinct chattering] [in English] Analgesic. [in English] Excuse me? [in English] The painting. I bet you the title of this painting is Analgesic. I mean it causes a headache. [in Taglish] It makes you want to what? Reach for a bottle of analgesic. [chuckles] Attorney James La Madrid. Panyero. Stephanie Aribe. [in English] So you're a lawyer, too? The number of lawyers in the Philippines is really growing. I bump into one every half an hour. You like paintings, too? No. I like crowds. [in English] I usually get drawn to crowds. When I saw a lot of people at the entrance, I passed by to take a look. You? [in Taglish] Actually, the artist is a former client of our law office. [chuckles, in English] Oh, okay. [in English] Well, then, I hope I didn't say anything slanderous against him or his work. -[in Taglish] Did I, Panyera? -[chuckles] [chuckles] [funny music playing] [screams] Why are you holding that? No! I was looking for something in the cabinet and I found this. I hid it there, so why don't you mind your own business? I was not! I was looking for something and I saw this-- Wait! What if our son sees this? Our son wouldn't find it because I hid it there. Give that to me! Give it here. What is that for? [in English] For research! You know, I feel insulted! This is product research! My publisher gave it to me to finish a chapter in the book I'm finishing about the reliability of the dildos and vibrators! Is that hard to understand? [in English] So disgusting! [mid-tempo music playing] Is he jealous of this? [sighs] Why doesn't he mind his own business? That's why I hid it there. [in Taglish] So, are you a partner in your law office? No. I’ve only been there for two years. [in English] Okay. Ateneo also? [in English] No. UP. UP is okay. I mean, what's important is we're practicing lawyers, right? Actually, I'm supposed to enter San Beda. But a professor hated me. As for me, I grew up in a family of lawyers. [in English] That's why I ended up taking law also. [in English] I mean we're so into it, even my cat is named Attorney. [chuckling] [moans] [in English] I think I have to go. [in English] Thank you so much for the dinner. [in English] It was a pleasure meeting you. [in English] Same here. [shrieks] Come on, girl! Hey! Wow! Your taste is improving! [in English] In fairness! -No way! It's scandalous! -[chuckles] Those things shouldn't be displayed here. That's cute. Whatever! I have a new underwear line! Why are you looking at my competition? Because your designs are too daring. Daring? From what I know, you wear bloomers. Hey! When it comes to panties, relations aren't important! -[in English] In fairness! -[chuckles] -[in English] Hi! -[laughing] [in English] Hello! -[in English] Hi. -It's okay. It's alright. Did you come together? [in English] Well, how's the underwear designer? I'm sorry you don't earn from me. I don't wear underwear. I'm sure all the dust in Metro Manila is there. I don't go to dusty places. [in English] Oh, and how's my charming sister? What are you doing here? They don't sell old women's clothing here. You? Are you panic-buying again? [in English] Well, you know, shopping is my therapy. Wait a minute! [in English] Enough is enough. It would be better if we hang out together. [in English] Hey, Sister, go, Sister, go, Sister, go! [in English] Let's go! [Margot] My daughters, different beauties, different attitudes, different pride, different approaches to life. [Patricia] We should bond often. We should agree on at least one thing. [in English] Like the guy over there. [chill-out music playing] [man, in English] Hi, girls. [Girls] Hi. [in Taglish] From the clinical standpoint, based on what I know about male body language, among the four of us, he will like me. [in English] I beg to disagree. I think he will like me. [in English] Believe me. I bet my life on it. He will talk to me. [in English] Excuse me, girls. Could you please get over your illusions? [Patricia] Well, here he comes! -[in English] Hi, girls. -Hello. -[in English] Hi. -[girls] Hi. [chuckles] [in English] Hi. [mid-tempo music playing] -Let's go, babe. -Let's go. Ew! Oh my, we've lost! He likes someone with balls. [in English] Oh my gosh! So much for your clinical standpoint! [indistinct chattering] I made a mistake. Wrong! [in English] Sorry. First time! [girls laughing] -He's gay! -[laughs] [crowd cheering] Thank you for coming to our fiesta. -[man, in English] Shoot! Shoot! -[crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] [screams] Oh my! He's so good! Chi-Chi! Did you see that? [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] -[in English] I love you! -[girls cheering] Hey! Hey! Put that away! Don't you know that Patrick and I are engaged to be married? You three, watch it, or else! [crowd cheering] [dog barking] [shrieks] -[dog barking] -Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi! Come here! [in English] Chi-Chi, that's bad! [in English] Sorry! Sorry, everyone! -[in English] Sorry. -Oh, geez! [in English] It's really ironic, Doc. As an obstetrician, I helped a lot of women give birth, but my wife and I can't even get pregnant. There’s nothing in the test results that should worry you and your wife. -[in English] Doc, six childless years. -[phone ringing] I'm getting frustrated. -Is there no other way? -[in English] Excuse me. Artificial insemination. -[in English] Hello? -Hey, you. How's your day? -[in English] Can we meet up? -I'm just in a meeting. [in English] I'll call you right after. -[in English] I'm sorry about that. -Who was that? [in English] Another impatient client? There are a lot of annoying people in this world. Like I said, we still have to run other tests, but for now, you have nothing to worry about. -[grunts] -[dog barking] [in English] Can you take your dog out of here? It looks ridiculous. It's like you're asking me to get out! [in English] Did you know that that thing has been embarrassing me since the first day you got it? Embarrassed? Didn't you know that we became popular animal lovers because of her? Control your dog! [in Taglish] Excuse me! She has a name and it's Chi-Chi! So don't treat her like an animal! Then teach her how to behave, okay? [snorts] Chi-Chi, he's just tired, that's why he said that. Don't be angry! [solemn music playing] [Vito, in English] I told you I can't talk right now. I'll talk to you later, okay? [in English] Gotta go. [chuckles] [in English] Okay. [low-tempo music playing] [sighs] [woman, in English] Yes, honey? Hey! Stop flirting with my boyfriend! How dare you! How dare you visit me at my place to just call your mistress right here? -[in English] So? -So? We have no commitment, right? [in English] When you're with that person, you're committed to that person at least for the moment you're with her! What's that? A commitment with expiration and renews every day? What now? Are we committed or not? No! We don't have a commitment, so you can now leave! What's this? A replay of the first one? This is different. [in English] This time, you get out of my house and you get out of my life! [in English] Okay. Fine with me. And this! Take your rotten cellphone! ♪ Goodbye, my love ♪ ♪ it was fine while it lasted ♪ [in English] Get out! [in English] Get out! [in Taglish] My gosh, he turned this into a musical! [woman speaking] My boyfriend doesn't ask me for anything except sex. My friends said I look worn out. [crowd laughing] That's natural. [in English] Men have 10 to 20 times more testosterone than women, so their view of the world is more sexual than ours. [in English] Thanks. [in English] Thank you very much for calling. [in English] I'm afraid we ran out of time. [in English] Thank you very much, Dr. Patricia Llanes Quinto, for the very enlightening discussion. [in English] You're welcome. Thank you so much. [in English] We'd like to remind everyone of her book, Size Matters, available at all leading bookstores. Once again, this is Adrian. I'll see you again next Saturday for more of Let's Talk. [people clapping] -[in English] Thank you again, Doctor. -Thanks. You're a bad influence! You destroy relationships! Me? -Or him? -You, Patricia Llanes-Quinto! You should be ashamed! You animal! Did you know that my husband… Your book says the wrong thing! Because ever since my husband read your book, Size Matters, he became impotent! Your book shouldn't be published! Wait a minute! This is embarrassing for my guest. So it's me. Madam, you have a choice. Your husband can avoid reading my book. Yes! I do have a choice! How dare you! [shouts] -Doctor, are you okay? -Now, what? [intense music] [grunts] [Margot] Patricia is the one more like me. Her being straightforward and her knowledge of romance that she made into a book and earned from it. If I was good at English, I would have written a lot more than her. Size Matters. [in English] Grab a copy! Mom, are you and dad really over? Alexis, didn't we talk about that already? Why? What is your dad telling you? Nothing. He was just asking about Uncle Vito. You told your dad about Uncle Vito? [in Taglish] Yes, Mom. What's wrong? Papa already has Aunt Katrina anyway. Mom, where is Uncle Vito? [in English] Why don't I see him anymore? [in English] Well, he's busy. [in English] You know what? I like him. You like him? [in English] Uh-huh. Just as I like Adobo and shopping. [in English] Are you no longer like this? [in English] What's "like this"? [in English] Together, like husband and wife. [in English] Ah, Alexis, Uncle Vito is just a friend. [in English] But sometimes he sleeps here. Who told you that? Nanny said Uncle Vito sleeps here when I'm with Dad. He sleeps in the other room. [in English] So, are you a virgin, Mommy? Where did you learn those words? In school. In Religion, we talk about the Blessed Virgin Mary. [in Taglish] According to our religion teacher, a virgin is someone without a man in her life. [in English] So, are you a virgin, Mommy? My dear, don't be too religious, okay? It's better if we talk about the birds and the bees. [in Taglish] I don't want the birds and the bees, Mommy. [in Taglish] I want the real thing. Hey, you! You're talking nonsense! Just glue those leaves together! [in English] Mommy, don't panic. What do you mean "don't panic"? You know, Alexis, you’re picking up a lot of nonsense. [in English] Don't listen to other people. Just listen to your Mommy. Oh my! If I didn't fight, I might be unconscious now. You might be at my wake right now. [in English] How big was she, Mama? [in English] Very huge! [in English] With huge mammary glands? [in Taglish] Peter, I know I taught you that word, but the better word for that is "breast". -[in English] For ordinary conversation. -Okay, Mama. Peter, is your papa here? There he is. That's Papa, right? I heard all of that. Am I obliged to comment? [scoffs] [in English] Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. -[in English] Gone With The Wind! -Yes. -[in Taglish] You're really good. -Thank you. -This is such a beautiful place! -I'm telling you this is perfect for your wedding! This is so beautiful! It's so beautiful! The altar should be placed here! And here, I will put the choir here. Where should I put my guests? -Here? -Courtney, here. -The reception should be here. -[dog barks] -Hurry! -The reception will be here. I suggest that you should go outside first for Patrick's fans. So it will be dramatic. Baby, do you like it? [in English] But I want it simple, intimate, and solemn. [in English] It should be a spiritual event. What do you mean? No more breathtaking and astonishing wedding? We already talked about this, right? [in English] That was before! [in English] This is not a Catholic wedding. Courtney, wait a minute. What's your religion? Catholic. Babes, we're Catholic! I'm now born again, babe. Brother Tony will officiate the ceremony. Papa? Who will walk me to the altar? -Chi-Chi. -[dog barks] Chi-Chi? Babes, it can't be Chi-Chi. Papa must walk with me! [in English] One more thing. I want only vegetables at the reception. -Vegetables? -Vegetables. What kind of guests do we have? Cows? [in English] I decided I'm officially a vegetarian now. That's it? No flesh and no meat? I have a suggestion. Why don't you get married during Holy Week? That's a good date too. Oh, I don't want that. I can't be Virgin Mary. And he will be Joseph? It's like Christmas. It's kind of weird. Oh… But I can be Mary Magdalene. I will wear a red gown! That's fantastic! When you told me you and Patrick were a couple before, I know you just exaggerated when you said something happened between the both of you, right? [in English] Wrong. Do you want to know how he was in bed? [in English] No. I just want you to know that the Patrick that you were intimate with before is different from the Patrick I'm with now. -He's now a religious fanatic! -What's this conversation about? Is Patrick the type of guy you want to marry? [in English] No. Why? Don't you love him? [in English] Love? [in Taglish] I'm sorry. I haven't been infected by that sickness. What should I do with Patrick? Dump him slowly. But I love him. [in English] Well, dump him very slowly. Maybe you're still attracted to him. That's why you want us to separate. [in Taglish] Well, for all you know, he's also attracted to me. You know what? It’s useless talking to you! I don't want to see you at my wedding. And I don't want to see you anymore! [snorts] Ever! Hey, miss! [in English] Careful, Sis. -[shrieks] -[man] Are you okay? So irritating! [in English] Hi. She's my sister. Another one! Please turn around. [low-tempo music playing] -Ah. -Is it good? We'll just call you, alright? This is not fake. Is this what you want to see? Oh my! Oh my! No, please! Julius. [in English] Okay. We'll just call you, okay? -[in English] Okay. Thank you for coming. -Let's go. Take care. Come here, Julius. Come here. Come here. -What now? -You're making me crazy! Come here! I told you I want meat! A meaty behind! Not in front! Ma'am, we're going to make a frontal shot, so it means the center of attraction is in front. You're right! But I'm an underwear designer, not a producer of adult films! [in English] Okay. Do we have more applicants? There's one. Pick one who has a perky butt. Let's see if he has a perky butt. Ma'am, here it is. Let me see this. Ma'am, here he is. Perky butt. [mid-tempo music playing] Oh! [in English] Sorry. [sighs inward] [in English] Can I have a tissue? [in English] I can do it. It's okay. [in English] I can do it. I can-- [solemn music] [in Taglish] No. Wait. Wait, James. This is not right. So, let's make it right. How do you want to make this right? [in English] I have to go. Stephanie. Stephanie. Steph. [exciting music playing] I love her. I love her so much. I did everything she wanted. I pretended that I'm not interested in commitment. I pity you. Why are you so crazy about Isabella? Is there really an answer to that kind of question? That's the problem with you guys. You woo us, but we'll choose who we like. Why are you going to marry Patrick? Is there really an answer to that kind of question? I made her insecure. I thought she was going to commit. [in English] It backfired. Do you think Isabella's incapable of loving? I don't know. Even I can’t understand her. To think she's my half-sister but we still fight. Why is she like that? She's a woman but she doesn't like to commit. Maybe she doesn't want to lose someone or people close to her left her. That's why she doesn't want to invest in a relationship. -I can't understand her. -Maybe she's really like that. Ma'am, Ces Drilon called. She'll interview you on October 7. There's also an invitation from Boy Abunda for his show Private Conversations. And also Winnie Monsod. You'll be her guest in Palaban. You also have an invitation from the French Embassy -French? -for the Basque Day Celebration. And ma'am, there's also one from Burkina Faso. What's that? Where? A new country in Upper Bolta. In Africa. Wow. I'm so popular. It's scary. [in English] "I'm nobody! Don't tell! They vanish, as you know. How dreary to be somebody! How public, like a frog, to tell your name the livelong day to an admiring bog!" Emily Dickinson. Wow! You're good! Go clean the floor. [in English] Yes, ma'am. [tense music playing] Why is it not here? Where is it? It's not here. Not here. Oh my! Who took it? Oh my! Someone might see it! It's embarrassing! [voice quivering] Not here. Where is it? Not here! Oh my! Where is it? My son might have seen it. Maybe… Our maid? Right. Day! Day! Hey! Gwyneth! [in English] Yes, ma'am? You're so classy! You even want to be called Gwyneth! Have you seen the… the… the one I'm using here? What's that, ma'am? The… It's like this… It's long. Pencil? No. A thicker one. Ballpen. No. It's… Did the kid come in here to play? I think he played here, ma'am, but I'm not sure. What? Call him! Hurry! Ma'am, he's still in school. He might have put something in his bag that he took to school. There's something, ma'am. There is? [in English] Pencil case. Not that! What I mean is like this. The tip is like a mushroom. It's for this. The one you put on your stomach? Idiot! Not that one. Just help me look for it! Ma'am! According to the Human Security Act, what you're doing is terrorism! -You look like a terrorist! -[tense music playing] [in English] Thanks for honoring my invitation. [in English] It's not a problem. [in English] Please. [in English] Would you like some? -[in English] Ah, sure. -Okay. [chuckles] [in English] Say when. -[in English] When. -[in English] Okay. Alright. [chuckles] [in English] So, um… [in English] I'd like to apologize for what happened the other night. [in English] Um, it's okay. [in English] I mean, I shouldn't have acted that way anyway. [in English] It's okay, so… [in English] Cheers. [in English] To what? [in English] Uh, here's to… [in English] Uh, whatever. [giggles] [in Taglish] Nanny, all these bags are imported, so it’s 1,000 pesos. One thousand. [in Taglish] And the shoes’ original price is 1,000 dollars, -but 1,000 pesos is okay. -Okay, ma'am. And this one is local, so this is only 100 pesos. And this one is 300 pesos. And this… is 800 pesos only, nanny. Just make the Louis Vuitton given to me by my ex-boyfriend 35,000 pesos. -[in English] Thirty-five thousand. -Okay. Oh. Put this on the list, nanny. [in Taglish] That pair of shoes. The leopard one. [in English] Good morning, Sister Isabella. [giggles] -[in English] Hi. -Hi. [chuckles] Wow. These things are still good and yet you’re selling it. [sighs] I’ve used these last year. I don’t want to use it this year. Oh. -Don't you… -Do you want to buy? [giggles] Don’t you just need money? Do I look like I have no money? [chuckles] [in English] Look, Isabelle. Do you want to talk? [in English] Talk about what? Nothing. You might have a problem. I don’t have a problem. But if you want, I could give you one. [chuckles] You know what? You’re really crazy! Okay, I’ll go ahead. [in English] Okay, bye. Take care. [gentle music playing] -[in English] Bye. -Bye. [scoffs] Looks like she had some. [in English] Right-- Aling Tere-- [in English] And the Jubilee-- Patrick! Are we always going to be like this? [in English] If you die today or tomorrow, is your soul ready, huh? [in Taglish] My God, Patrick! That’s not normal! [in English] If I don't talk to you this way, you won't even listen. [in English] You don't understand! You know what? Since we haven’t finalized our guest list yet, let’s call it off! [in English] What I want you to do is join me on this journey, Courtney. Just leave me at the departure area! You go alone on your journey! You’re breaking up with me? Breaking up! -You can’t even say breaking up! -[in English] Whatever. Whatever. Look at yourself! You don’t even know yourself now! You’re not even good at basketball anymore! [in English] All I care about right now is our salvation. You don't even understand that. -[in English] Salvation? -Our salvation! Oh, please! Just save me last! Let’s go, Chi-Chi! It’s time to sleep! Let’s go! -[dog barks] -[door slams shut] [mid-tempo music playing] Feels like a bump. [in Taglish] Sorry, ma’am. Your card was denied. How did that happen? I just issued last month’s check. -[in English] Two days ago. -[in English] I'm sorry, ma'am. [in Taglish] Can I talk to the credit card company manager? Okay. [in English] Hello? What kind of service do you have? [in Taglish] I just issued a check two days ago. [in English] I've been your customer for eight years! -And I've been a good customer! -Excuse me, ma'am. [in Taglish] It’s okay now. -[in Taglish] He will handle it. -I got it. Do you want me to pay you? -Where’s my check? -No, don't worry about it. My God! Where’s my check? [classical music] [in English] Let's go, Vito. -[in English] Thank you. -[classical music playing] [in English] Gotta go. [low-tempo music] He wasn't like that. [in Taglish] Three months ago, I could sense something else, like there’s… a slight imbalance in his personality that I can’t understand. You know what? [in Taglish] Annulment cases are not our office’s area of expertise. Annulment? What annulment are you talking about? I’m here to share my problems with you. [in Taglish] Okay. Maybe Dave was just stressed out with his workload. [in English] Could be. [in English] But I could sense something else. [in English] You have to learn how to relax, Patricia. You know that stress plays a big part in why you’re acting like that. What am I going to do? Shh. You can do it. [in English] I have to go. Really? Wait! I was the one saying those things before. It’s more challenging to make male underwear. -Because you have to make it bigger… -You mean you know the male anatomy? [in English] Not exactly. Let’s just say I have a wide imagination. Hm. -[drums playing] -[crowd cheering] -It’s beautiful, right? -It’s beautiful. The designs are really good. -[drums playing] -[crowd cheering] [in English] Go, Vito! -[drumming music] -[crowd cheering] [crowd, in English] Go, Courtney! Go, Courtney! [crowd cheering] [in English] Woo! Party! [in English] Thank you! Thanks! [in English] Cheers! [in English] I'm sure she'd appreciate… Will she listen to me? -For me… -Attorney Ocampo Llanzares. Attorney La Madrid. [in English] This is my husband Richard. -[in English] Richard, James. -Hello. [in English] Oh, James, hi. [in English] I've never met such a well-respected conductor before. -[in English] No, I'm a doctor. -A doctor. Uh, Richard, excuse me. I just have to go talk to Courtney. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Courtney! -[in English] Courtney. -Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. [in English] I'm just so happy for you! You’re really good! -[in English] Are you okay? -Of course! [mid-tempo music playing] [in English] Hi. -[in English] Hey. -Oh, hi. [in English] Hi, Sister. You’re not invited. [in English] Oh, really? I thought this was open to the public. -[in English] Hi, Sister. -Hi. [in English] Where's your husband? [in English] Excuse me. [in English] Hi! Hurry! Come here! [in English] Hi. [in English] What is it? Can you go home now? Or just go somewhere. I’ll follow you. Why? Will you please show me some respect? What do you mean? You haven't formally introduced me to your sister yet. Right? Isabella told me the truth. [in English] And stick to basketball. Don’t be such an actor! What do you want? A reconciliation with your ex-lover? My ex-lover? Who? Don’t act like you don’t know! Isabella told me everything! [in English] You gotta be kidding me, right? I just met your sister now. You know what? You’re already born again. You said you’re a different person. You shouldn’t lie! But I’m not! What’s happening to you? Um. Wait a minute. [laughing] [in English] This is really fun! You know what, Isabella? You’re really crazy! [in English] Sister, relax. You still haven’t introduced me to Patrick. Why did you say he was your lover? Don’t tell me you believed me? Can’t you take a joke? Did you honestly believe me? [in English] Don't touch my birdie. Resist temptation, please. [in English] Just call it and it will come. -Parokya Ni Edgar! -Correct! [in English] I still hate you. [in English] Oh, but Sister, I love you. [in English] But I love him. -[in English] Babe, I'm sorry. -[solemn music playing] [in English] You know, I'm confused. [in English] I think we should forget about the wedding. [in English] What? [sad emotional music playing] Patrick. Patrick! What really is your problem? [in English] I'm okay. What you did to Courtney was not good. [in English] I can't believe you all fell for it. Truth is, you fooled us too. Is it my fault if all of you are gullible? You really don’t care, do you? Even with yourself. You can’t even manage your money right. [in English] You know what? I won't be shocked if one day, suddenly you end up in jail. You know what? I’m not scared. Because my lawyer is really good. [in English] And he's a special friend. [in English] He’s James La Madrid. [low-tempo music playing] [sobbing] [in Taglish] You know, come to think of it, in a sense, you’re similar. [in English] Excuse me, sir. But you know me. I tell you everything. [in Taglish] Ever since we became friends, all my adventures and misadventures, I tell you everything. It would be better if you don’t tell me. [in English] And how was I supposed to know that you're half-sisters? [in English] I mean, you're both smart, beautiful, not even the slightest hint of any similarity or resemblance. I’m more beautiful than her. [chuckles] [in English] So why don't we ruin this friendship? Be lovers. [in English] To hell with friendship. Those words won't work on me. I’m not Stephanie. [chuckles] -[in English] Touché. -Happy birthday, Peter! -Peter’s party is really great. -[people clapping] Where’s my mom? She’ll be here. I’ll wait for her outside. -Come, Peter. Come with me. -She’s not here yet. -[in English] Hi, Mommy! -Hi! -[in English] Hi, my girl! -Hi, Auntie! [in English] Hi, Peter. -[in English] Happy Birthday. -Ms. Isabella Verona? -Who are you? -We’re from the bank. We’ve been sending you notices but you don’t reply. Ma’am, we’ve been looking for you. -What do you want? -We will repossess your car. How did that happen? That can't happen! I already issued a check for the next two years for that car! We can’t do anything. -Pull that now. -Hey! You can’t do that! -I will sue you! -Sister. Sister. What’s happening? Uh… Nothing. [in Taglish] I'm having the car fixed. It’s broken. [in Taglish] Call me when it's finished. Please. Let’s go. [car revs] [grunts] Wait a minute. That’s my husband. Hey! [upbeat music] -[mid-tempo music playing] -Let's go. -[in English] Careful. -Okay. [in English] Okay. -[Dave, in English] Remember this place? -[Mandy] Of course. [chuckles] [groans] -[groans] -[chuckles] [Mandy] Hey, behave. [shrieks] [grunts] Ouch. Damn you! You're cheating on me! [grunts] -[grunts] -[shrieks] -Bastard! -Patricia! Mandy? You’re this gay’s boyfriend? You’re a couple? [in English] Sorry. [intense music] [screams] You stole my favorite toy! Damn you! You stole this! How dare you! Remember this! "Do not do unto others what you don't what others do unto you!" [in English] Confucius. [grunts] [in English] Let's go. Let's go! You deserve that! You wait and see! Shameless! You’re disgusting! [in English] It's okay! Everything's under control! It's okay! It's alright! [in English] Okay! I'm fine! Alright! Hey. [in English] You look gorgeous tonight. Are you here for a meeting? [in English] No, I just met with someone. Hey. I didn’t know that Isabella is your sister. I knew her for a long time. I didn’t tell her anything. [in English] You know I really missed you. [grunts] [mid-tempo music playing] Stephanie. [in English] Mama, what is same-sex marriage? [cries] [in English] Why, Mama? What's the problem? [in Taglish] My son, from now on, don't read my books. [in English] Stop being too smart. [in English] Okay, Mama. [cries] [low-tempo music playing] Where’s that taxi I asked for? It’s not here yet. Oh my! I’ll just walk. [in English] Hey, Sister. Want a ride? [in English] No, thanks. [in English] Are you sure? [in English] Yes, I'm sure. Wait a minute. [in English] Look, Isabella. Let's talk. [in English] Can we please talk? [in English] About what? [in English] This is about Attorney James La Madrid. [in English] What about him? Don’t imagine too many things. [in English] Because nothing happened between us. [in English] Okay, fine. We did kiss. But that’s it. [in English] Because Isabella, I’m not like you. Whatever James told you, it’s not true. He told me nothing happened between the two of you. [in English] So, okay. So believe what he said. [in English] Okay. [in English] So, now, you want a ride? [in English] No, thank you. I'd rather walk. -[in English] You mean in your heels? -Why not? -[in English] It's exercise. -[chuckles] You're crazy. [sad emotional music playing] [romantic music playing] [sobs] [breathing heavily] [sobs] Mm. What is it? Mm? Nothing. I’m just happy. Why are you crying? Nothing. [in English] Tears of joy. [in English] Tears of joy? For what? [in Taglish] Because… after all these years of not having a child, I’m just happy that we’re still together. You’re not going to sleep yet? I have to finish this first. [in Taglish] Go ahead. I’ll follow. [in English] Five minutes. [breathing heavily] Chi-Chi? [in English] Oh my God! Chi-Chi! [in English] Oh my God! Where are you, Chi-Chi? Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi, where are you? Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi! [in English] Chi-Chi! [screams] Oh my God! Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi! [smacking sounds] [in Taglish] Excuse me. Have you seen my dog? Bogs? What’s his surname? You’re making me crazy. Chi-Chi! [Patricia, in English] Honesty is such a lonely word. -[in English] Everyone is so untrue. -Billy Joel? -[in English] Correct. -Thank you. [in English] I'm tired of all your quotations. [in English] From authors, from writers, singers. Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Billy Joel, Barbra Streisand. You even included Yoyoy. [in English] I'm tired of them. Why? It’s appropriate. You know what, Patricia? I tried to understand our relationship, but you're ruining my manhood. [in English] You emasculate me. So you made out with a gay? To be a man? That’s what you’re good at. Because you’re like that. You’re sarcastic. [sobs] But do you know what it feels like to be a man with a sexologist wife like you? No. I don’t know. I also don’t know what it feels like to be a respected man who is fooling his wife. But that’s not the issue! Patricia, the issue here is you’re domineering! You’re insensitive! [in English] And it took you so long for you to say that? Okay. I admit it. It’s my fault. [in English] And I'm sorry. [in Taglish] For all these years, I was unfair to you. I thought… that if I married a sex advice guru, I would learn to enjoy having sex with a woman and I could control myself. But… -I really enjoyed being with you. -[cries] [in English] Until… Until Mandy… [sobbing] [in English] Until Mandy came. [sobbing] [sobbing] [in Taglish] Until I met Mandy. [sobbing] [Patricia] Man. All these years, I didn’t notice it. Before I forget, I talked to our son. [in English] You can visit him once a week. I don’t need you anymore. Get out of my face. My feelings for you… are gone. Ma'am, that’s Aegis. [in English] Perfect. [sobs] -[sad emotional music playing] -[crying] Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi! -[dog barks] -Chi-Chi? Chi-Chi! [in English] Chi-Chi! Oh my God. I thought they already cooked you. Oh, Chi-Chi. [in English] But how do we get home? See what you've done? You know I’m not used to going out alone. What are you doing here? I went to your house. You wouldn’t wake up. I took Chi-Chi for a walk. You took Chi-Chi for a walk? I thought you didn’t like dogs. [in English] Honestly, I miss her. You missed her? Did you miss me? I missed you too. -Your curliness. -It's playfulness. Mm. Is this really happening? You missed me? [in English] Anyway, let's just finalize the wedding. [in English] Please? But think about it first. I think I’m sick. What is it? I felt something in my boobs. Let's have it checked out. [in English] Don't worry about that. After the check-up, we'll continue with the wedding. -[in English] Okay? Let's go. -[chuckles] Let’s go. [screams] -[man] Kids! Your balloons! -[crowd chattering] [in English] Hi! -Let’s take a picture. -Okay. Okay. Oh, there's a balloon. [in Taglish] That’s the woman who issued bouncing checks! Arrest her! What’s this? [in Taglish] Ma'am, you’re under arrest. [in English] For violation of the bouncing checks law. Do you have a warrant of arrest? Here it is, ma’am. [mid-tempo music playing] Just come with us. Wait a minute! My daughter’s party is not over yet! Just explain yourself at the precinct. [in English] I’m so sorry about this. -[in English] I'll call Mama. -No. You? I didn’t issue a bouncing check to you. Don't you know that my dad is a General? We have lots of connections. I have more connections than you. [in English] I will see you in court! [in English] I'll call Aunt Courtney and Aunt Stephanie. No need. I’ll do it. I’ll call them. [in English] What's happening, Mommy? Just take care of your party. -Nanny, handle the party. -Yes. -Have you been bad, Mommy? -Not so bad, my child. -Let’s go. Let’s go. -That’s enough! I’ll be back! I’ll just fix this. Mommy. [cries] Your mom will be back. She’ll come back. [mid-tempo music playing] Stay there. Come. There she is. Isabella. [sobbing] Sister. [crying] Don’t worry. You won't be here long. I’ll take care of everything. And I brought lots of sex therapy books. You can share it with your cellmates. Here. I brought this for you. Courtney, that’s not allowed here. She’s right. And it's too many. -Is that so? -Yes. Come on. Thank you. You know what? Let’s take a seat. Come on. Take a seat. [in English] You sit here. Sit here. Come here. Take a seat. Why didn’t you tell us? [in English] I didn't think you'd care. What? Is that even possible? We’re family, right? Where’s Alexis? We didn’t bring her here because… we don’t want her to see you like this. [sobbing] Courtney, sorry for the crazy things I did. Yes. I forgot about it already. [sobs] -[in English] Hey. -What's wrong? -Why? -What’s happening to you? [in English] Why? Did we say something? What’s wrong? Why? I’m dying. What are you talking about? Why? Tell us! I felt a bump near my boobs. [crying] -Maybe it’s just a lump. -What? She’s right. What will happen if there’s a bump? How will you know? Raise your arm, then… then feel it. If there’s a bump, that’s it. Is that it? Wait a minute. I think I have one. I have no idea. [in Taglish] Richard knows a specialist. -So… Uh… -Okay… Maybe we should have a check-up. Right? So it means this is cancer. Idiot! That’s not cancer. You haven’t had it checked yet. What if we do a mammogram? Shh. Hey. Come on, girls. What’s important is we’re all together now. [sobbing] Vito? [groans] Vito told us you’re here. -He’s the first one to know about this. -Yes. Vito does catch news fast. Vito likes gossip? Thank you, Vito. Alexis called me. [sad emotional music playing] Why don’t you just give Isabella’s case to another lawyer? What? This is the only time I can do this for my sister. True, but you might be forgetting… you’re just a newbie. You took the Bar exam twice before you passed. [intense music] Will you please stop shoving it in my face? Stop repeating it. [indistinct speech] I’m not repeating it, but let’s be real. You even lost the case of… driving without a license. [in English] Hey, that was two years ago. I have more confidence now, okay? Okay. But remember, if Isabella loses her case… Come on. Don’t make me lose my confidence. [sighs] [in English] My client issued post-dated checks to the complainant, but the complainant said she lost the checks, so my client issued replacement checks. But then the complainant said she lost everything. Uh… But then, what she did was… she cashed all the checks, including the lost checks that she reported. [in English] There were no replacement checks, Your Honor. [in English] Our documents show that all the checks, including those that bounced, covered the total amount… [Margot ] Stephanie is the smartest among them, but she didn’t get my confidence. But I know she just needs a little push, and with the full support of the family, -she could have it. -[woman] Yes. [in English] Your Honor, the purchase amount has been reduced by the complainant even before the checks were released. [in English] As a matter of fact, my client has text messages from the complainant wherein she agreed to the reduced amount. [in Taglish] But Your Honor, it’s not written or marked that it’s a replacement at the back of the checks, which they call the replacement checks. [in English] Your Honor, my client did not find it necessary to do so because they have been friends for a long time. But she did inform the bank of the replacement checks when they were issued. And we have evidence from the bank. [in English] Here are the documents to prove it. -[in English] Your Honor. -[woman speaking indistinctly] That’s nothing. [in English] I don't see any strong legal basis for the complainant. -[in English] That's a good sign. -[in English] Case is dismissed. -[hopeful music playing] -[people cheering] Come here. Don’t issue post-dated checks anymore. What did the doctor say about you? It has to be removed, but it’s not cancerous. Thank God! But I have one more problem. What’s that? Can I put your name on the invitation? To be one of the bridesmaids? -Of course! -[chuckles] Of course! Finally, I can introduce you to Patrick. [in Taglish] My ex-lover. Silly! You always fight because she's so gullible! -[in English] Ma'am, welcome back! -Hi! Alexis. Okay, go to the kitchen first. [in English] Prepare something for Mommy to eat. Nanny, go to the kitchen first. -[in Taglish] Yes, Mommy. -Hurry. Hurry. [in English] Would you like to come in and have something? [in English] Not really. I have to get going. Oh yeah, You've been in court the whole day. Someone might be waiting for you at your pad. No one. [in Taglish] Thanks again. It’s nothing. [in English] I'll do anything for a… a friend. [in English] I love you. [in English] Friend? [in English] I love you, too. [in English] Friend. [sad emotional music playing] [in Taglish] I have to go now. [in English] Bye. [exciting music playing] [priest, in English, indistinct] [in English] My dear friends, let us turn to the Lord and pray that He will bless with His grace this wedding-- Hey! Stop the wedding! Why are you marrying her, Patrick? It should be me! [crowd chattering] [upbeat music] [in English] Best wishes! Congrats! How dare you! Sorry, I made a mistake. [women] You’re ruining the wedding! Get out of here! [in English] Congrats. If you can’t do anything good, get out of this church! [in Taglish] Hello, Patricia. Where’s our venue? What? I thought it’s here, at Saint Bridgette Parish. I’m here. It’s so embarrassing! I came to a different wedding! [screaming] [Courtney] Let’s go! Hurry! [Margot] Finally, the wedding pushed through. ♪ My life ain't complete Without you, babe ♪ ♪ It's just you and me… ♪ [Margot] They just waited for me to arrive from the States. -[crowd clapping] -[camera clicks] Patrick agreed to a big wedding because he can’t say "no" to me when I say so. He also didn’t insist on vegetarian food because I like meat. [crowd clapping] [Margot, in Taglish] Removing the non-cancerous lump from Courtney’s breast was successful. What her father told her was right. Abstinence before the wedding will make your sex life exciting. Because after the operation, the couple couldn't be stopped. [upbeat music] [Margot] Patricia and Dave’s annulment pushed through. Patricia? [in English] Hi. Hello. [Margot] Patricia released another book. But now it’s all about love. There’s more money in it. [in English] That's what my book is all about. [in English] L-O-V-E. -At long last, Stephanie is pregnant. -[screaming] [groans] What happened? I'm pregnant. -You’re pregnant? -[laughing] [laughs] [chuckles] [Margot] Isabella and Vito are still always together. They still treat each other as friends. But I think they will end up together. We held a big party. Actually, it’s an engagement party. Whose engagement? Mine, of course! I met a hunk. But I don’t feel comfortable calling him "papa" because he’s so young. Even if I find it hard to spell my name. My name is Margot Solis Llanes Ocampo Verona Vallarta. And Manalo will also be added. You will run out of ink with it. It’s too long to write. I beat my children because I already had five men. The reason I chose a younger one is because hopefully, this will be the last. Because I will probably die first. [light up-tempo music] [in English] Today, breast cancer is the leading killer of women ages 35-54 worldwide. All over Asia, the Philippines has the highest number of incidence rate of breast cancer. Presently, we are the 9th in the world. Millions of women die because of breast cancer and we don’t know that 500,000 women die every year. [in Taglish] And one out of four women who are diagnosed with breast cancer die within five years. [in English] And no less than 40% die within ten years. But what really is breast cancer? [in Taglish] Breast cancer is a hormonal disease brought on by a poor diet and lifestyle. Eating fatty food, no control over diet, and no exercise. [in Taglish] And did you know that 80% of breast cancer cases are due to toxic chemicals which we can get from our food, water, and air? But how can we prevent breast cancer? [in Taglish] According to experts, there is a 95% survival rate if breast cancer is found in its earliest stage. [in English] To stop breast cancer early, doctors recommend self-examination and a mammogram. [in Taglish] Women should have their first mammogram between the ages 35-40. [in Taglish] The earlier you have it checked, the better. [in English] And of course, the most important thing is to have a healthy and active lifestyle. So let's not be reckless and careless. Don’t let breast cancer come to you. Let’s take care of and protect our bodies now. Let's open our minds and think about how to stop it. Let’s hold hands and fight breast cancer.
