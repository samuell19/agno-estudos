Tell me again. Start from… I know where to start from. It was 1961. And you were a grown up but you still lived with your parents. And I worked for a wonderful man named JFK. And that summer I took my vacation at Camp Unity. It was where you went to get out of the city if you were young and single and a registered democrat. And there were handsome boys there. And one day you and your friends were playing ping-pong… Who is telling this story? when somebody stole your ping-pong ball, which you didn't appreciate at all. That's right. But why did he steal it? You know what? That's not the point. The point is he gave it back. What will you give me for it? And that might have been the end of the story. But later that night… I decided to take a walk by the lake. There he was and he was holding… I love this part. …a bouquet of wild flowers. So I introduced myself. And that is the story of how your mommy and daddy met. I love that story. And someday when you're all grown up you'll meet someone too. I know. I have it all planned. Don't lie to me. I know you've been drinking. I'm this close to a recording contract. And I'm Conny Stevens. Just this one loop. That's all I need. We can't afford a piano, Vince. You're living in a dream world. I didn't say "buy a piano", did I? I didn't use those exact words. If you want to be a failure all your life go ahead. Mom, dad, look. He should have drew the poor house 'cause that's where you're gonna put us. Great. Don't forget to brush, Nicholas. It's gonna be okay, pal. I don't hear practicing. Tell me again about the piano. Well. This was not __ piano. This belonged to your grandma Lina. Hand-carved by a man named Faustus Daukintis. And they loved each other very much, more than life itself. Life itself? But their parents disapproved because… Because he wasn't Jewish. Can I finish a sentence? Then some very bad people invaded Lithuania, called Nazis. That's right. So Faustus Daukintis bribed an official so that he could get passage for your grandmother in a boat bound for America along with this piano. And he told her that he would meet up with her later in New York City but she never saw him again. Never again did she played that piano. "One Big Happy Family". See? This man has 3 daughters and he marries this lady who has 3 sons and a sheep dog. And they form this rock'n'roll band, even the dog. we had to do something. Miss Muff is really groovy even if she is an old lady. I know, Taffy. But telling lies, even white ones, isn't groovy. I hope you have learned something from all this. We have, Dad. And we're really sorry. That's Taffy. She always says "right, Stinky". Right, Stinky? Don't let him stay up all night. Nicholas Dockin where is your pass? I need the teacher! You're dead meat, Dockin. His name was Johnny Hassenschmidt. He was the first boy I met after moving to Los Angeles. He'd probably be my boyfriend now if my dumb parents hadn't forced me into private school. But if they hadn't we wouldn't even know each other. Let's play "someday". You first. Someday I'll have contacts. Someday we'll be grownups. Someday someone will love me more than life itself. Someday my whole life will be completely different. Except… We'll still be friends. Forget that guy from 2nd grade. There could be somebody out there that's perfect for you. Someone you don't even know yet. I think I really learned something from all this. Right, Stinky? All my life I pictured it. Falling in love. Night after night I pondered my destiny. I couldn't wait for the story of my life to happen. I knew it would happen. It was just a question of where, when and how, and how soon. But I knew for certain that once I found him, everything would fall into place. My search for a major?? proved frustrating. So I entered grad school and waited for that piercing moment of revelation. I guess the truth is nobody had come along who could actually live after my expectations. Nobody was "him", till you. Everything in my life has led up to this moment. Oh, hasten not this loving act Rapture where self and not-self meet My life has been the awaiting you Your footfall was my own heart's beat. That's beautiful! Nick, you have a real problem at intimacy. Can I leave now? Can you take 2 minutes to converse with me? Of course, you always manage to squeeze intercourse into you busy schedule. What can I say, you make the time. You have no romance in your soul. You are incapable of giving and receiving love. By pursuing architecture, you're merely constructing this symbolic wall to separate yourself from the rest of humanity. Well, you snore. None of this is surprising, giving your __ childhood. At the age of 3 to witness your own father trampled to death at a fox hunt. I think I should tell… And then that mother of yours shipping you to some snotty Swiss boarding school. We have to talk. Please, don't smoke. I have my final presentation in 11 hours. I have so much work into this model. __ Timon Heldenfeld will be judging my work. Everything in my life has led up to this moment. You know, this whole tragic-slash-romantic mythology you cling to is just a kind of addiction which our sick culture encourages. I'm quitting. After this semester. Just write something. The semester is almost over. You'd better get going. He wanted me to spend the night, I could see it in his eyes. He is so protective. Oh, sure. All I have to eat today is this fallafel. -Oh, look! -What? There's Dean. Don't say "hi", don't wave. He might not see us. Poor Dean. He really likes you. Oh, did I tell you! Gregory is considering a job at N.Y. __ Can you imagine it? Gregory and I in New York City. Your parents said you could stay at their guest house after grad school as long as you wanted. I'd rather die than live in their guests house. New York could change everything. I could write poetry. Gregory and I… Gregory's essays! This has nothing to do with my life. It's not a political statement, it is a roof garden. You put a roof garden on a homeless shelter. I thought the kids should have some place… I am just asking what is the source. There is no source. The choices we make are determined by who we are. I am not saying that it's good. I realize that it's crap. Is that what you want me to say? Okay, it's crap! was apprehended today for the possession of cocaine. Francesca Lanfield, known to millions as Taffy for the hit TV show One Big Happy Family has been hospitalized in the past for drug dependency. In other news, president Bush… Mr. Daukin Made a fool of myself back there, didn't I? Yes. I know what it's like. You're Sophia Monroe. When I see a building of yours this feeling comes over me… It's hard to explain. I never really believed I could amount too much until you. I know what it's like. The feeling that you just never belong, never be good enough. I'm an architect. We pay attention to how things are made. Shit. You idiot! Your stupid little building nearly killed me! I know a lot of you brought in work today, so who would like to begin. I have a poem I'd like to read. It's here somewhere. I know. Does anyone else have a poem today? Kevin? Gravity. Come in. I've been expecting you. There is a knock on the door and love walks through and lights the fire. Smiles. Smile? Still, love, we are going to stay a while. And the fire breathes and reads its spell. But then love runs out of lies to tell. For love is restless. Love is a flirt Love has places to go. And people to hurt. so here is the shovel to smother the flame tomorrow you'll barely remember my name. And I'll try to forget you my dearest one, as a prisoner tries to forget the sun for life holds no curtness, Love holds no charms Since I beheld you in another's arms I thought I had learned all I could in a classroom situation so I left college. That makes sense, you moved on. How did you get into ghost writing? From a friend of a friend I knew this doctor, so next thing I know I'm writing "Hi, I'm your __ " Read it, you'll love __ Then I did this diet and exercise book, "Eat less, move around more"… Let me just guess. You're tired, sick. Tired of ghosting, you're busting to write something of your own. I like other people stories, they're safer. I don't expect what I write to change anybody's life. Could I ask you a huge favor? Could I possibly smoke one cigarette? Sure. Let me just… Hold on one sec. Actually, I'll have one with you. I basically quit but… Me too, basically. Nobody smokes anymore. There is one thing that I shouldn't mention. Do you want me to help you with that? I do this all the time. Thank you. Were was I? -Oh, yes! Francesca! -Yes. Francesca will not go with an "as told to". She wants sold crat __ I never put my name on anything I write. That way nobody gets hurt. I think you are the perfect person… To tell her story. I loved her as Taffy and… One Big Happy Family. Yes. Everybody loves Taffy. What in the hell is keeping her, anyway. I know she had some business thing. Misty, try Francesca's purse. This is awful but I actually thought she was… Dead. I know. She gets that a lot. I have Francesca on hold for you. Hello. Do you remember those two developers I told you about, Murdstone and Heep, Where are you? …who can't build their condominium if I won't sell them my building? They've got me at some architectural place. and they're petrified. It's highly enjoyable. The book means everything to me but this is business. I can't believe it. I thought she was… Dead. I know. What is she doing here? She owns "La Fortuna". What's "La Fortuna"? The small 18-unit courtyard building Murdstone Heep must acquire in order to start construction of the much anticipated Murdstone Heep complex. He's got to see this. Timor, What can I say? I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have gone behind your back. Everyone moonlights nowadays. Oh, yeah. And this is your apology? I never thought they would get this kind of publicity. I know how you love the __ So you go behind my back and you design "The awful truth". I know it is a stupid name for a restaurant. The watering hall "du jour". So tell me, are you pleased with your work? Yeah. Kind of. Not completely. Among those spotted at the __ Icecube? What can I say? Enough. I have to go now and meet Murdstone and Heep, and this woman with cold feet. That is important for the business. So am I not gonna be considered to design Murdstone Heep? That's my punishment? It's not a question of punishment. And no, you're not. At least let me sit in our meeting. Come on. Just seat there, don't say anything. I'll just seat there. I promise. I don't know. Maybe. That's her? That is the holdout? Right, Stinky? Unbelievable. She looks so much like she looked in the cheerleader episode. I remember the pompoms. -Tell her you're a fan. -Oh, come on. 17 thousand? Yes, fine, I'll have dinner with both you and her tonight. Bob, I don't care what you're wearing. That was my lawyer. He goes "Francesca, why can't you sell?" And I'm like "You know what that neighborhood means to me" "I grew up in that neighborhood" Don't people live there or something? Think of them. And he says: "You can still change your mind because that letter of intent isn't legally binding" So I guess I'm changing it. -Hi. -Hi. What your layer doesn't know is that you'd be a partner. We want you to have full participation because that's what you deserve. We wish to address your concerns but Mr. Dockin is not authorized to… What? We're gonna have to pick another restaurant because we're never going to get into the awful truth. He can get you in. I sort of designed it. Get out of here! No, I stepped my foot. I'll see you at 8. You must be so fucking proud! Don't you just love the way it turned out? I'll sell. On the condition that I make full partner like he stated and the further condition that he designs it. I shouldn't have done that. Were you serious about me designing? I enjoy bending people to my will. Sue me. I just felt like helping you. But I guess nobody is allowed to do that. cause you don't need anything from anybody. Am I warm? The story of your life. Tell me the story. Start at the beginning. Maybe this is the beginning. We've got a deal. I know you think I'm not ready to… I know you're not. Once you start down this road there's no turning back. I don't want to. Woooooooooaaaah! I'm sorry! Hi. I'm meeting… There you are. I'm meeting Francesca Lanfield. Is this place finished? Follow me. I see. Hi. Isn't this something? I love it here. Francesca saw Icecube here. Unfortunately she won't be joining us. Some food poisoning thing. I didn't get all the details. How did you come to represent Francesca? That's a long story. You don't have to tell it. I just had something in my eyes. I'm sorry. Are you all right? This table just keeps stabbing me. Francesca and I were involved. I have moved on. I have. That's great. Do you know where the ladies room is? No? Okay. Nick, I don't know what to say. Do you want me to come over? No, I need to be by myself for a while. You know how it is. One minute your father is alive and the next minute… I begged him not to fly. I've got to go. What was that? Just a business thing. I've rescheduled. -And you had a dinner thing? -I canceled. How long have you lived here? 2 and half years. You should unpack. This is just temporary. Like insanity? I plan to design my own place in the near future. This is kind of a layover. I get it. You can't unpack 'cause that would mean you really live here. Which you don't. You too good for you. Who are you to deserve some place perfect? even unpack. I never went to college. This place does need something. Needs a piano. I'd buy you a piano tomorrow and you'd hate it. You would buy me a piano? No, I'm saying I wouldn't. Cause you'd prefer to dream of some future piano to a piano in actuality. I used to be the same way. I just sold a whole building. It feels highly enjoyable. "La Fortuna" was my shelter as in money. I was 18. I was full time at Crystal Meth University. God, I love methamphetamines, more than life itself. My business manager was scared I go through my whole savings. So we bought it. Saved my life. You never grew up there? Please. Never even seen it. Speaking of things you've never seen, where's the bedroom? You're not shy, are you? My tits developed at national television. Shy __ I'm sorry. They developed where? While I was doing the show. What show is that? Get out of here. You seriously don't know what I'm talking about? You never watched the One Big Happy Family. "One Big Happy Family"? No. You see, we weren't permitted to watch television when I was a kid so… What do you want? You want me to be shy? Just be yourself. -Brief encounter is on. -Really? Come on over, we'll watch it together. Come on, we never see anymore. Okay. -Where did your mother hide that __ -Oh, daddy. You're not angry with me, are you? No, I'm not angry. Forgive me. Forgive you for what? For everything. For meeting you in the first place. for taking the piece of grit out of your eye. For loving you. For bringing you so much misery. Oh, God, I am so lonely. I can't live like this anymore. I'm sorry. I had a peculiar evening. I had dinner with this guy, Bob. He's a perfectly decent guy. He's somewhat obsessed with his last girlfriend but otherwise… Gwen, sweetheart, come here. Why haven't I found someone? Am I so misshapen? So repellent? Why can't it just happen like it did with you and mom? Sweetheart, I'm going to tell you something very important. Tell me, please. I never loved your mother. What? Never. I mean, not real love. What? What are you talking about? when you're talking about. When you're searching for. I will find someone. You have someone. She's upstairs. She gave birth to me. Many times, I can't tell you how many times, I thought I'll wait it out, maybe she'll die. You've been waiting for my mother to die? Not really but… Yeah, that's true, finally I can say it. No, you can't. I thought you would understand, you of all people. This is very unsatisfying. I wanted something chewy, I got something kecky. Under the sink, behind the __ Are you serious? Wait. How can you say you never loved… What about the story? The night you met. What about the flowers? You went down to the lake to find her and you picked her flowers. -I did? -Yes! No. I remember. I had a date with a girl I was just nuts about. What the hell was her name? Anyway, she stood me out, and then I run into your mother. She made a big deal. She thinks I picked the flowers for her. What am I gonna do, argue with her? You can't argue with her. So you married her and lived with her for 35 years to avoid an argument? Josie. Her name was Josie. Damn it! I'm sorry. I just… I learned something rather disturbing last night. You know how that is when something just shakes you to the core? No. Great. Where were we? Last night I had the most highly enjoyable sex possible. This is __ I know. The lack of closet space is really disheartening. It's not the closet space. My parents are getting a divorce. I'm losing you. What do you mean see other people? Nick, I'm losing you. Jesus Christ! -I'm so sorry. -It wasn't your fault. She's British so maybe they're most legal over there.?? Gwen. I don't believe this. Kevin Helper from poetry class. -I'm so sorry. -No, it wasn't your fault. Are you all right? I'm having trouble getting started on this book but… Oh, you mean am I injured. No, no. We should exchange insurance information. Yes. How are you? I'm great. And change is good. Change is healthy. We have to keep moving or just slid our turds?? and slowly bleed to death. And yourself? I teach high school now. Do you live around here? No. My friend Patrick does. Did. I don't need that. -Bye. -Bye. Maybe sorting through a dead guy's possessions would brighten your day. Yeah. Gweenie! Hi! Happy thanksgiving. Happy thanksgiving. I can't believe I'm seeing you. Thank you. Well, you're busy. How is Dean in the car? I don't know. He just likes to sit there sometimes. Says the music sounds better in there. I don't know. __ are you? __ don't fight. They just listen you to death. I cannot believe you met Taffy. I thought she was dead. Just a drug addict for a while. Chelsea! Love of my life. Come here. God, you're grown! It's a nightmare. They're happy. And get this: my mother is videodating. Isn't that mentioned in the Bible as one of the signs that the world is coming to an end? She keeps foisting applications on me. Maybe that would be fun. You don't know. -Debbie -What? That's not the plan. The plan is find some temporary shelter and finish the Taffy book and then get out of L.A. because —let's face it— I belong in New York. When will you stop with that whole New York thing? Are you okay? I'm the surgeon, I cut people! You didn't need to do this. He didn't. I did most of it. Your cat is trying to get in. I don't have a cat. It's trembling. This is not my cat. Do you have any tuna? I can't have a cat. A woman living alone with a cat is… That's when you have 3 cats. Definitely don't do the three-cat thing. I don't like cats, of any quantity. A very lovely little piano. It was my grandmother's. It's hand-carved by a man named Faustus Daukintis. They were in love but it just wasn't meant to be. She dumped him. I played professionally at one time. Which, of course, led to my career in motion pictures. If you need some cat food I have plenty. My cat eats like a Jew. Excuse me? All I know is the dearest man in the world to me is a Jewish man… That isn't even an expression. Someone __ kitchen boxes in the bedroom. It's me, Glane. Hi, Lane. No, with a "ga", Glane. Me and the band are throwing some __ Thank you. That would be lovely. I'm afraid I have a previous engagement. My limousine should be here __ Francesca hates cats. You should feed your cat, she's skinny. Introduce me to your darling husband. He's not my husband. I'm not married. A sweet girl like you? Why aren't you married? You're not serious. Being married is not necessarily the answer. My parents __ Mime too. Small world. I just will never understand by a darling girl… It's the end of the 20th century and we've reached this point where people are frightened, they're full of fright. And besides, I was too young to get married. For years. And I went directly from too-young to "why aren't you married, what's wrong with you" There were those 10 minutes in 1992 when I was exactly the right age and weight to be married but I've… Forgot to set the alarm clock and I slept right through it. The piano is out of tune. I've never married either. I suppose because nobody ever asked me. That's the other reason. I met Irving when I was 21 but mother didn't approve of him. And then he married someone else. But I have never stopped loving him. I love him to this day. What's going on here? What's happening? You said I could bring some of my stuff over. I meant little personal cotton things. Table goes here. Hold it. I'm putting my piano here. You don't have a piano. But I plan to acquire one and I plan to put it here. When? In the near future. You just don't run out and buy a piano. You have to browse and compare and shop and… It sounds like a plan. Nick, I am here almost every night. I know but this is… You're moving in. I'm not moving in. These guys are movers. -Are you guys movers? -We're movers. What's that supposed to mean? I need a surface. To go throughout my scrapbox for the book?? write poetry You write poetry? I write all kinds of shit. Just the other day I wrote a great poem. It was all about you. Really? You work hard at your blueprints from morning till night and hopefully we'll shack up without one major fight you like deconstructionism, the new, not the old, and you're great with a blowtorch Or so I've been told You're good with the clients and also with sex which is why you're the greatest of all architects That is something that I would love to be able to do. Actually someone tried to teach me. But I could never… so whatever I made I just never ended so I gave up. That hat doesn't suit you. You need something with a brim. You should do something about that stube. Flowers or a bench. Everyone here has done something with their stube. Right, Cinders? What is this? That's the song they were playing on the radio the first time Irving kissed me. Excuse me. This sucks! The development corporation of Murdstone and Heep… It's a total conspiracy, like a JFK movie. I can't believe this. My boyfriend moves to Utah, my restaurant gets condemned and now this? What does this mean? I don't understand. Some kind of hearing thing. To challenge the eviction. Hearing tomorrow night at the high school. I think we'd better go. I wish I could go. I'm just so behind on my book. But you let me know what happens. You do that for me? Let me know what happens? Sure. Whatever. Gwen. This is nice. this is fun. Seeing each other. But there's something that I have to say. I know I'm behind in the book. It's taking me a while to find an approach. I promise you… I think we should go to Paris. Excuse me? I think we need it. We'll be surrounded by rude French people. It will bring us closer. Gwen, will you look at this? Is this funny? Am I laughing? You must be Bob. I'm Beebee, I'm Gwen's mother. You're kidding me! We were on our way to the __ . This is Paul Pullman Sit, please. Paul and I were matched up together to the video dating service. It turns out —can you believe this— Paul was at Brookman College all 4 years I was there, our paths never crossed. Never crossed. So, Bob, how was __ I've just asked Gwen to go to Paris with me. Bob, we're not going to Paris. Of course you should go. We should all go. I've never been to Paris. Oh, you would love it! Maybe we could swim to the wine country. Okay, that's it. I'm sorry. It's really nice meeting you in this very surreal kind of way. Excuse me. Do you know where Timo Heldenfeld is right now? Shanghai. This is extremely non-enjoyable. Do you mind? Some of us are trying to listen. Ever have sex in a parking lot? Thank you, Mr. Babcock. And now we will open up to members of the community. Just a minute. I wanna say something. My name is Katz. I'm leaving in La Fortuna 46 years. Did I say 46? Here, 47 years. I moved in in 1948. I'm 80 years… 81 years old. Mr. Cats, if you could… Mr Cats, if you please sit down. Someone help Mr. Cats. Are there any other comments from the floor? Hello. Testing. Your name, please? Miss Harriet May Kinney. But I don't use the "May". Irving said "loose the may" and I did. If you would limit your remarks, Miss Kinney, to those concerned with the building. Certainly I'm concerned, I live there. I've lived there since 1936. I know everyone of my neighbors. It's the courtyard with the fountain, with the gold fish. One of them passed away recently. One of the neighbors, the gold fish are thriving. Oh, the parties we'd have. Paper lanterns… Ernst Lubitsch would come. Louis Brooks and… All I know is I just can't sit home every night, mother. This isn't Omaha. Who is Louise Brooks? She was a silent movie star but that's not the point. It isn't? Excuse me, miss? The point is legendary people lived in La Fortuna. That to destroy it would be to eradicate a part of our past, a part of ourselves. That La Fortuna has a story. A story irrevocably entwined with our own. Indeed, the very history of the city… Excuse me… Who are you? It's me, Gwen. No, she wears a funny hat. If I may, this is a waste of the council's valuable time. This building has value. Doesn't it, Miss Kinny? It holds precious secrets about what this city once was and what it inspired to be?? and it's held on through change and against incredible odds. Against earthquakes… You're that sweet girl next door to me that smokes too much. …and we need to hear that story. We need to tell it because this city can be a cold cruel place. That's the awful truth. You can't tear it down. Because I won't let you. Gwen Moss, you don't remember me. John Hass, used to be Johnny Hassenschmidt I can't believe you're my councilman. How come I never got to know you. My parents, they transferred me to private school. Can I give you a lift here? I'm from New York. Good luck with this building thing. __ Can I call you sometime? God, yes. How is the book coming? It's terrible. It's horrible. I'm completely blocked. This is just a letter, to the Times. -Do you wanna hear it? -Sure. Once upon a time I needed a home. And the day I found one was the day I first beheld the beautiful courtyard at La Fortuna. She goes on and on about she knows all her neighbors. __ good thing. What is her problem? It is pretty rude to read at the table. She doesn't even sign her name. She signs a friend of La Fortuna. How do you know it's a she? I just know. "Beheld", come on. I can't believe you're not coming with me. Don't go. I cannot be in town for the holidays, no way. It's non-enjoyable. I can't get away. I am so behind and the schematic is insane. I bet __ this whole Christmas __ with mom and pop the second I leave. I don't think so. Right. I forgot your dad's dead. I guess I just assumed he was. Actually he's not. Yet. He's just a drunk. So is my mom. So I don't speak to him ever. __ to the family. So you'll be okay. All by yourself. Alone. I'll be fine. I'll figure something out. The building sleeps, yet I can not. Who talks like that? I am sorry but this is the 5th letter in 3 weeks. I know on the surface they appear to be extremely well-written, entertaining letters but this person is attempting to sabotage us, I know it. Forget the preservationists. No one listens the preservationists. On the other hand, where is your site report? I haven't filed one yet. Dockin is scared to show his face at La Fortuna. Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what. I will pay a visit to that dump right now. She's not home. I too have a previous engagement. He'll be here any minute. -It's beautifully preserved. -Yes. It's held up well. So many people… So beautifully planned, I always thought. Designed by… What was that woman's name? I used to know it. Oh, my God. I think I know her name. She was one of the first woman architects in Los Angeles. Is that a fact? It all connects. Most people don't notice. I'm an architect. We pay attention to how things are made. I could tell you stories… A man lived right over there. Fell like a ton of bricks for the lady two doors over. Really? Both married, mind you. I said "mother, this isn't Omaha". Went out together one day to buy fly paper, never came back. Still send me pictures of the grand-children. There he is. -Hi. What's the matter? -Nothing. Well, so… Come here. -You look beautiful. -Thank you. Smoking? Do you smoke? What? No. Non-smoking. As "none is possible". What was that? Oh, my god. Are you all right? What happened? Excuse me. __ in this place. Look out! -Are you okay? -I'm fine. Lactose-intolerant. The first step is admitting it. You're very sweet. Very sweet with that old lady who lives near you. The character she is. It's not like she lives in a shoe or anything. She's actually led a fascinating life. I don't think I've ever spoken to one of my neighbors. I'm too self-centered, obsessed with my career… I see myself running for major some day. That's just the beginning. With me, my career comes first. I guess not a lot of women like to hear that. So you can't eat cheese of any kind? The building sleeps, yet I can not. -What? -Nothing. You know how something as insignificant as those La Fortuna letters can sometimes just shake you to your core? No. I don't believe it. That's my ghost writer. That's the woman who's writing my book. Who is she to make feel this guilty? Look over there and tell me if that woman is looking at us. No, she's not looking at us. I know that guy from somewhere though. Bitch. I'm sorry, what? I Can't do this. Can't compete with someone you've never even met. What are you talking about? That woman who writes those letters. That's who you're thinking about just now, isn't it? That's who you're always thinking about. Isn't that Taffy from One Big Happy Family? Oh, god. -I thought she was… -Dead, I know. I'm writing her autobiography. You know Taffy. Oh, my god. And I cancelled on her?? today. I'd better go say something. I think she saw me. Francesca, hi. Hi. Look, I'm really sorry about today. __ I just met someone. I am being thrown out of my home. I'm sorry but this book means a lot to me. I'm sorry too. I swear I'll get to work on it. I promise. Bob wants you off the book. I'm being fired? Fired? You've never been fired before? No. I've been fired a lot. This just never gets any easier. Excuse me. Can I ask you something? Yes, it's me, I'm not dead. Would you have me arrested if I smoke one cigarette? I have a really short attention span. My pattern was always get them __ fall in love with me, get bored, get really bored, leave. But this guy, he sees me for what I am and he never even watched the show. Can you imagine how enjoyable that was to hear? Men have always treated me like I was Taffy. And he's smart, he's really successful… My problem is he's kind of… Emotionally unavailable. Deeply. His emotions require voice mail. This is an incredibly controlling person. You should never use tissue on your face, only cotton. I won't phone a man who's not in therapy. Life's too short. Why? What does tissue do? I think he's falling in love with someone else. Oh, honey. Then he is crazy. He is an idiot. You are beautiful, intelligent and interesting. I know. We can handle this. We are women. Just get him into therapy. The guy you're seeing, is he in therapy? No, he is perfect. Francesca, I know this is none of my business now but don't hire another ghost. Write to yourself, to your story. Me? But I never even went to college. Or high school very often. I think you'll find it highly enjoyable. -I'm __ for historical status. -Really? Look at this. See? I discovered something. Something important. Look who designed La Fortuna. Sophia Monroe. One of the first woman architects in Los Angeles. She literally changed the face of this city. -Nick, do you know what time it is? -Nope. Come to bed. Honey, I can't. The building sleeps, yet I can not. Well. Good night. Good night. So? I like your other Bob better. Who? It is out of the question. Why not? __ Who __ Anyway I wanna preserve several pieces of the facade… They want your original concept. They're not gonna spend more money so you can preserve __ We can at least attempt to preserve some of the building. You're beginning to sound like this crazy preservationist. She is not crazy. She has a case. Now she has a case? Why, because some dead movie stars lived there? Because Sophia Monroe designed it. Our teacher. I warned you. Do you remember what I told you? I know this wasn't the plan but there are things that you can't… There are some things worth holding on to that connect us to the past and to each other. That show us who we are. Sophia Monroe made a unique contribution to our lives. Since her death, she's at last been accepted as one of the leading lights of modern architecture. Therefore I urge this commission to withdraw the demolition permit for La Fortuna. And Louise Brooks lived there. I brought you a kitty. I was… It's easier. They'll keep each other company. At least 2 isn't 3. I'm sorry. __ and I was supposed… __ what to eat today, one of those happy meals or one of those non-fat, non-dairy… Debbie, nobody cares. Just eat it. I need a cigarette. I can't really stay. Wait. I wanna tell you about John. Just wait. You've got to hear the whole thing. It's so amazing. Finding him again after all these years. It's such a great story, don't you think? Forget it. I'd better get going, Dean's waiting for me in the car. Why? Because he is. Why is Dean in the car? The man is constantly in his car! He happens to like spending time in his car but I can't talk to her about Dean or Chelsea Because you don't understand. Women with children. It's like a club that I can't get into. Like that cool group in high school. She tells me every minute that she's gonna be moving to New York like __ I am not moving to New York. And I don't know why Dean is always sitting in the car. It's just the way it is when you share a life with someone. It's complicated. You just wanna keep hearing how perfect everything is. But how could you bring me a cat? I'm sorry, I'll take it back. No, no, no. Two is better. You know, you think I'm done because I have these things that I have. Like it's the end of the story. And it's not. It's not a story. Good morning, Cheryl. -Angenelle. -What. Angenelle. What. Just heard the bad news. La Fortuna was granted historical status. No problem. I just assumed that it was… Don't worry so much, you'll leave longer. It says they granted it historical status. Doesn't say they can't tear it down. Give me a cigarette. -What about the preservation committee? -Can't preserve shit?? They're all out celebrating. Some announcement in the paper. But you can't believe everything you read. I let you know that I will fight this. I'll do everything in my power. But it's not within your power, is it? That something has come to an end. Don't look so sad and think it was all your fault. You're a dear sweet boy to come here. No, I'm not, believe me. Yesterday my mother calls. My father collapsed again. It must be bad because she asked me to come see him and I said no. So, you see? I'm not sweet. I don't even know why I came here. Yes, I do. I need to find the woman who wrote those letters. Who? A friend of La Fortuna. I have to speak to her. It's important. Sorry, I have to rest for just a moment. Just tell me her name. I can't. I can't see you anymore. You know how mother feels about you. It wouldn't be right but I do care for you. What do words can say? Me too. Saving this building is the only thing I've ever done right in my whole life. They cancelled __ against preservation. The city government. Is what I hate about my job. You outvoted? No. The vote is unanimous. Where's my other shoe. I was not voting against you, I have certain commitments. This is the part I hate. This is the part __ actually hurts. I believed in you. I thought you and I were… I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Some things can't be forgiven. Some people can't be forgiven, like you. You're gonna crucify me because I told you the truth? About how I voted? About who I am? You said you believed in me. You don't even know me. Cinders, what are you doing? Come here. Harriet. I don't like to delay by the point but at the same time __ Anyway there it is. That's very disturbing. What type of thing? An elderly woman passed away last night at La Fortuna. Miss Kinney. Miss Kinney. This just does not help the mood in the community. A lot of __ That's his uncle Faustus. He looks like you. Go home. I'll stay with him. -Bye, honey. -Bye. I called the firm. They said you went to see your father. I did. Francesca, I did. You don't speak to your father. Well, today I did. But it doesn't bear mentioning to,?? for instance me. I didn't know that I was gonna do it. I don't get it. I give you the opportunity of a lifetime, I give you myself, which I… which I swear would never do. So tell me, what did I do wrong? I watched you when I was a kid. What? I loved you. I loved Taffy. I was just afraid to tell you. -You lied about that? -Yeah. This is the longest hours I've ever been in my entire life. That's a perfect ending to __ Come on, don't do this. -Listen to me. -No, you listen. You're never gonna live up to your potential. You're never gonna have a piano. You're self destructive and make self destructive choices, you're toxic and I don't wanna be around you anymore. You're just worthy to leave. Shut up. Isn't this about when you always leave? When the __ is getting hard and you figure there's gotta be something better or newer or easier… I know, I've done it. It's all I've done. So neither of us know how to do this. So what? So what? Why can't we just start from here? I can't. Why not? Because it's gonna end eventually. Everything does. The show gets cancelled and everybody goes through separate ways. Even if they're your family. I don't want you to go. Someday you'll thank me. Honest. __ right? Right Stinky? Oh, my god. Cinders Come here, baby. It's okay, baby. We're gonna go home. So then it's true, you're leaving. I got something for you. What? I quit smoking. Who am I gonna talk to now? -Wanna know how I quit? -No. How? I'll be right back. First time? Me too. Gwendolyn Moss Nicholas Daukintis It's Lithuanian. I know. Most of us have appreciated the perfection of the universe, the animation of living things, the action of the human mind and the power of love. These things all seem to denote a dynamic lifeforce that surges through everything around us. This force appears to direct all things harmoniously but irresistibly towards a natural, definite, useful conclusion. Is it hard to recognize in this lifeforce a power greater than ourselves? What happened to La Fortuna? Well, it's gone but that's not the point. The point is you're here. And that's the story of how your mommy and daddy met.
