(clock ticking) - [Reporter] Reports keep coming in from all over the globe confirming it as true. To say that the world is in a state of shock this morning would be to understate the situation. The event seems to have taken place at the same time all over the world. Just about 25 minutes ago. Suddenly and without warning, literally thousands, perhaps millions of people just disappeared. A few eye witness accounts of these disappearances have not been clear, but one thing is certainly sure. Millions who were living on this earth last night are not here this morning. Speculation is running high that some alien force from outside our system has declared war on our planet. - Jim! - [Reporter] And some feel it to be a spectacular judgment of God. The United Nations is in special emergency session. (razor buzzing) (screaming) Bishop Franklin Sullivan, the chairman of the church confederation has proposed that this might actually be the rapture spoken of in some areas of theology. He says and I quote, of course even if it is something like the rapture, we need not panic. The very fact that we are here and able to discuss it is sign enough that it is not all inclusive. End of quotation. The event spoken of in the Hebrew Christian scriptures is described somewhat in the gospel of saint Matthew chapter 24 verses 36 and on. And Jesus Christ is reported to be the speaker. And he says and I quote, but of that day and hour knoweth no man. No, not the angels in heaven. But my father only. - The world will be at ease. Banquets and parties and weddings. Just as it was in Noah's time before the sudden coming of the flood. People wouldn't believe what was going to happen. Until the flood actually arrived and took them all away. So shall my coming be. Two men will be working together in the fields. One will be taken, the other left. Two women will be going about their household tasks. One will be taken, and the other left. So be prepared for you know not what day your Lord is coming. What is all this mean? It means exactly what it says. Any minute, any second could be the last chance that anyone has to give himself to Jesus. Because when he returns, it will happen that fast. The Bible says in the twinkling of an eye. Millions of people will suddenly disappear. Leave this earth to meet their Lord. And a shocked world will discover suddenly that what the Bible said was true. This is no joke. This is not a fairy tale. It will happen just as sure as you and I are here right now. So Christian be alert, and friend, if you haven't given your life to Christ, do it. And do it now. Because the rapture will come and Christ will return. It says in the Bible that he will come as a thief in the night.

I mean, he must've been straight from the farm. He starts blushing. I mean, he was really looking miserable. And I bet that creature thought he was really getting through. - What do you think about what he said? - [Diane] Who? - Guy who was preaching. - Oh, I thought it was a bunch of bull. - Some people get all strung out over things that don't even matter. I mean, I'm a Christian. - [Jenny] You are? - Well. Not like he was Christian. I mean, I go to church about every week. I try to follow the 10 commandments. I read my Bible once in a while. And I try and help people if they need it. - You're practically a missionary. - What else is there? - I don't know. - [Diane] Come on, let's go on some rides. - [Patty] Yeah, let's. - You guys go ahead. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. Maybe I'll go back to the teen center and hear a little more about what he has to say. - Oh, brother. Look, I paid a bundle for these and I wanna use 'em. You can always get converted later. Free. - That's right, Jenny. In a way, it is free. What I mean is, it doesn't cost anything but your life. - That sounds pretty expensive. - Well, it might seem that way. Until you realize that you're letting the God who created you, the God who cares for you more than any other person could, that you're letting him take over. There's no way you can lose. - Did you find them yet? - No. I must've left them at home. - Troubles? - Hi. - Guess I forgot some of my tickets. - Hey, I've got a whole pocket full. - No, that's okay. I couldn't. - Oh, yes she could. Otherwise she'll be in the mine all afternoon. - Maybe you won't need them. I'm Jerry. - I'm Diane. - And I'm Jim. - And I'm just dying to get on that midway. - Going to church and trying to follow the commandments, well, all of that's okay. But you can't confuse that with true Christianity. You see the Bible tells us what we already know about ourselves. We just can't be perfect, Jenny. And yet, our God is a perfect holy God. But there's no way in his present state or in ours for us to get together. - Hey, there's no way we're all gonna get on this thing together. This is your captain speaking. Welcome aboard the first fully automated flight. Every system has been thoroughly checked and the entire flight is guaranteed not to fail. Not to fail. Not to fail. - But he's done it for us, Jenny. That's why he came to earth. Jesus Christ was born a human being. And he grew and lived the life that God's holiness demands of each of us. And he was punished and killed. Punished as though he was one of us. - That seems so unfair. - Whoever said love is fair? When you begin to see just how far God has gone to bring us back to himself, you'll begin to see what the real meaning of love is. (helicopter whirring) - I love it, I love it! I could just fly all day! - Oh, stick with me, sweetheart, and you'll understand what the meaning of flying really is. - I'm so scared of those things. What if the motor stops or something? - That's a chance you take? - Oh God. I know I've spent a long time of my life just doing what I wanna do. I haven't given much anything about what you wanted. And yet, you have everything for me. You gave your life for me. If I were the only person on earth, you would've done it just for me so that my sins can be forgiven. And you say you'll come now. And live in my heart. Oh, I want that, dear God. I want to be forgiven and I want you to live in me. Take my life, dear God. Amen. - Now remember, Jenny, God always answers prayer. - He has. He already has. I feel it, I feel him. I feel like if I had wings, I could fly. - But you don't need wings now, Jenny. (helicopter whirring) - Do you have an extra key for the ping pong room? - Diane took mine. - Well that's that, I guess. - What do you mean? - [Jenny] Have you seen the new lifeguard at the pool? - No. - Well, Diane has. - You know, that really surprises me. I thought that guy she met at the fair really got to her. You know Jerry? - Oh, I didn't meet him. - Oh, that's right. You went back to the youth center at teen town. Oh, that's too bad. We met a couple really nice guys. - No. That's not too bad. I met Christ. - What? - I met Jesus Christ. I know what that guy was talking about. I'm a Christian now. - Well, that's great, Jenny. I hope it works out well for ya. - Has anybody said anything to you about becoming a Christian, Jenny? Maybe given you bad time about it or something? - No. Not really. Of course I've only been a Christian just a couple days. - Let me tell you something. Pretty soon you're gonna run into difficulty. I don't mean just people. But Satan isn't very happy about you deciding to give your life to Christ. He's just gonna do anything he can to try and get you discouraged and get you depressed. He'll tell you that you're not really a Christian or tell you you can't live a Christian life. Or just anything he can to try and get you down. Christ will give you the strength and the encouragement that you need to overcome all your difficulties. If you let him. Talk to him often, Jenny, about everything. Through Christ you have available to you all the power of heaven to overcome Satan. Isn't that neat? - I'm glad I caught you all together. - What's up? - Well, Jim and I, you know the guy I met at the fair. We wanna go water skiing Saturday at the dam. We want everybody to go. - [Diane] Sounds good. - [Boy] Sounds great, I'd like to go. (lively music) - Hey, you know. That new boyfriend of yours isn't such a bad guy. For a preacher. - He isn't a preacher. he isn't my boyfriend either. - Well, isn't he the guy at the fair who was making all that scary talk about the end of the world and all? - That's just something Christians believe in. - Well, do you believe all that? - I really don't know enough about it. - Hey, Patty, how's your new boyfriend working out? - Just great. I really like him. - Well, if you're going to keep him, my child, maybe it's time I taught you a few of the facts of life. Where are you going? - Just for a walk. - Why don't you stick around? You may learn something. - I'm sorry, Diane. I just don't wanna hear that kind of talk. - Well. Maybe we'll have our little talk later. After the children go to bed. Hey, did you tell me your guy was working in a zoo? - Not in a zoo. At the zoo. He's studying to be a veterinarian. So it's really good deal for the summer. - Hey, that's wild, Jerry's a pre-med student. We got ourselves a couple of doctors. - Well, what's Jerry doing? - [Diane] He's an ambulance attendant. - Oh, yuck. - Well, he says it's kind of gory sometimes. But a lot of the time, he just sits around all day and waits to be called. He says you never know when it's going to happen. - No one knows when it's going to happen. And when they asked him, Jesus said even he didn't know the exact time. But it's going to happen. One of these days, it could be any minute now, Christ's just gonna come back for his own. After that, it's gonna be pretty awful here on earth. - Like what? - Well, for example, the Bible says that right now, the spirit of God is holding back the full force of evil in the world. But after the believers go, the spirit will too. That means a whole new ballgame. Only this time with no rules. Evil will just take over. And the evil one, the Bible calls him the anti-Christ or the beast, will rule supreme. See, we just don't know what it would be like to live in a world like that. The good around us still has the support of the spirit of God. After he goes, wow. - You really believe all that? - Yes, I do. - Lots of luck. - I'll say one thing. Anybody that's left here is gonna need it. - If you really believe that, you couldn't even look at your watch without wondering if it was gonna happen now. - Yeah. But to the Christian, it's something we look forward to. The non-Christian is waiting for the end of life and doom. The believer's waiting to meet the one who gave us life. - The beast you talk about, was he the one who goes around marking people? My grandmother told me about a lot of terrible things that are supposed to happen. - The mark of the beast is talked about, Patty. It's probably some kind of identification mark. Based on the number 666. It says in the Bible that people won't be able to buy or sell anything without it. Kind of a super evil credit card. Only it'll be on your hand or forehead. - I wouldn't let anybody tattoo my forehead. - Diane, you know you have to be around when it happens. - Yes, yes, you do. - Do I? - Sure, because I like you, sweetheart. Can't you see that? And I am the anti-Christ. - Good, I was always a sucker for beasts. (laughing) - Well, I don't know if all that's true or not, but if it really is in the Bible, then why doesn't our minister ever talk about it? - And so when one embarks on an inquiry of this kind, plain old and I might add, God given, common sense shows us immediately that those differences which manifold deemed worthy of death are really dead horses. Now to illustrate this for yourself, ask yourself the simplest of questions. Do these so called basic tenants of Christianity really affect me at all? For instance, ask yourself, would I appreciate beauty any less if Jesus were not virgin born? Or ask yourself, would I respect the rights of others less if he had not gone about the countryside performing miracles? Or ask yourself, could I really be considered so gross as to somehow be responsible for the death of the son of God? Would I be so harsh as to condemn humanity to a fiery pit? Could I be more merciful than God who is reported to be love? No. You can see where we're led by these simple obvious questions. To insist that the Bible is anything more than the poetic expression of those greater principles by which man lives with man is to box oneself in with a wealth of opinion and counter opinion which really doesn't matter. Because it really doesn't affect the way we are. What matters, my friends, is what we can know about man's relation to man. Create the universe in six days if you like. But don't force me to accept that myth as fact. And make our relationship depend upon it, upon my accepting it. Believe in a real Adam. Believe in a real Eve. Believe in a real serpent. (ominous music) (siren blaring) - Now, you just kind of hang in there, Jim. We got the best doctors in the country lined up and twiddling their thumbs waiting for you to get there. (dramatic music) (siren blaring) - Why won't they let me see him? - You heard what they said. No one's allowed in. - I know, I know. But don't they have any feelings in this place? Is Jim Wright in that room? - I beg your pardon? - [Patty] Jim Wright's a friend of mine. I thought maybe I ... - [Doctor] I am afraid you are not going to be able to see him right now. - Will he be all right? - It's not possible to fully evaluate the situation at this time. Your friend was bitten by a large Indian cobra. Now that's serious business. - You mean, you don't have anything to help him with? - There's no serum to use in this case. Your friend is allergic to horse serum. And there's no commercial medicine available. - No serum? What are you gonna do, is he gonna die? - Well, there's very little time. But we're hoping that a blood transfusion will provide the necessary antidote. Now, we've gotten a hold of a man who owns a large snake farm who's been bitten several times by cobras. His blood has built up the necessary antibodies to fight this kind of poison. - [Patty] Yeah, but how long will that take? (dramatic music) (indistinct talking on radio) - Dear Lord, you said in your word that everything works out for the best to them that love you. Be our strength. Please let Jim make it if it's your will. You know what the reason is behind this crisis. Give us faith. Use it and give us the courage to accept your will. Please, Lord, let them get here on time to save Jim. - His pulse is weakened. It's his blood. - How's he doing? - Would you like to take over? - Yes. - [Nurse] He wants you outside. - Lord, grant this boy another opportunity that even through this experience, he might commit his life to you. We would ask, dear Lord, that you would speed the help that is already on its way. - We ask all this in Jesus' precious name. Amen. (exciting music) (sirens blaring) (rhythmic beating) - Well, he's going to be all right now. - Thank you. (slow music) How are you? - I haven't felt this bad since I ate my sister's first meatloaf. - You had a rough time. - Yeah. I had a rough time. - I'm glad. Well, I'm glad you're okay. I really am. - You know, there's a lot. I mean, you and I ... - Don't talk now. We'll talk later when you feel better. - [Woman] Wonderful time. - [Jenny] Oh, I bet you did. - I wish you could've gone with us. - Well, maybe some time. - We had beautiful weather. - Jim. - Hi, Jenny. - Hi. Mom, this is Jim Wright. - [Jim] How do you do? - Pleased to meet you, Jim. - And this is my little sister, Susan. - Susan? - Are you the one that got bit by the cobra? - I'm the one. - Is Patty here? - No. And I don't know exactly why I'm here either. Except that I was told that you prayed for me. And the pastor came to see me before my transfusion. It's really strange. But I remember after he left, I had a deep peace. And something told me I was gonna make it. I can't explain it. And I don't really understand what's happening. - You came to the right place to find out, Jim. - I'm reading this morning from Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians, chapter five, beginning at verse one. These are the words that we find in this passage. When is all this going to happen? I don't need to say anything more about this. For you know perfectly well that no one knows. The day of the Lord will come unexpectedly as a thief in the night. When people are saying all is well and everything is peaceful and quiet. Then all of a sudden disaster will fall upon them. As suddenly as a woman's birth pains begin. And these people will not be able to get away anywhere. There will be no place to hide. Now how can we be sure of all of these things? You recall that last week we talked about some of the specific prophecies that had to do with the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now this morning, I wanna talk to you about some of the signs of the end times. And one in particular, namely, the sign of the anti-Christ. When the time is right, then the Bible tells us that a very great and strong and powerful leader will appear. Now who will that leader be? Do we have any indication in the scriptures as to who this person will be? Yes, the Bible has an answer for that. The apostle John tells us in first John these words. Indeed many rightly will call him the anti-Christ. The Bible further teaches that this individual will be instrumental in bringing about a season of peace in the world. Although his ultimate end will be a revenge against God. He will be a very evil person. Now some think that if Christ were to come back in 30 years, that this individual could be living at this particular moment. And actually if Christ comes back before 30 years, then it's altogether possible that this man is active in government even this very day. I've talked to many of my Christian friends. About the rapture, that moment when Christ will come back to receive all believers unto himself. And I'm simply amazed at the number of stories that I've heard of people who have had the experience of thinking that the rapture had already taken place. I'm reminded of a neighbor that I had back in Nebraska. Who got up one night in the middle of the night, took off his pajama tops, and went downstairs for some ice tea. In the meantime, his wife awakened out of her sleep and discovered that her husband was gone. Turned on the light. Found his pajama tops and was immediately convinced that the rapture had taken place and that she had been left behind. Well, from our studies of past few weeks, we can conclude that we're living now in the end times. The days in which we live are seeing many prophecies being fulfilled. That we have never seen fulfilled before. And surely this serves to remind all of us that the time is short at best. And if we would be followers of Jesus Christ, we must join his band now. - Mom, I'm home. Sandy had to go to her aunt, so I came home early. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? (screaming) - What's wrong? - I thought you were gone. - [Woman] What's wrong? - I thought you were gone. - Gone where? - I thought you were gone. - Gone where? - I thought you were gone. - It's all right honey, you'll be all right. - I knew for a long time I should ask Jesus into my heart. But I thought I could do it any time. And then today ... - You'll be all right, honey. - I wanna ask to let Jesus into my heart right now. - You've heard it plenty times before, you know how to do it. - Dear Lord Jesus, please come into my heart. I know you died for me. And please forgive me for all my sins. - [Man] Watch out. - [Woman] Have a good trip. - [Man] Take care. (romantic music) - [Woman] Drive safely. - The best of luck to both of you. Bye now. - Bye. - [Crowd] Bye! (slow music) - [Reverend] And I pray that Christ will be more and more home in your hearts. - Would you doctors of religion like some nourishment? - Oh, thank you. - What do you think about all this, honey? - It's all beyond me. I've been raised in the church. Taught to do the best I can. To believe in God and hope for the best. What else is there? I mean, I'm good. I don't lie. I don't cheat. I'm as good as the next person. Maybe better. - God made us for himself. That he might enjoy us. And that we might enjoy him. And also that we might enjoy each other. But we, well, actually you, broke that relationship when you didn't choose Christ. - I never made that choice. - Have you ever chosen for him? - Well. Maybe not. But my minister says we don't have to get all hung up on that theology stuff. God is love and he's not going to destroy us because we can't help doing wrong, is he? - It's true that God is love. And that God is holy. But God will also punish sin. - I think I understand. But where does love fit in? How could a God who loved me cause me go to through what I did? - Well, Jim, you have to understand, that there are times when God uses circumstances in our lives to bring us into a close relationship with himself. Look at it this way, what chance did you have of making it after your accident? - Well, not too much. - None at all. There was no way that your body could produce the antibodies that were needed to fight that poison. - But someone else had been through it. His blood had the cure. - Exactly. His blood had the cure. And all you had to do was receive it. When you received his blood, that saved your life. - That's interesting. I'd never thought of it that way before. - Jim, the Lord Jesus Christ loves you. He died on the cross for you. He shed his precious blood for you that you might be saved. All you have to do is accept. Just like you did in the emergency room in the hospital. When that man came in and gave you his blood, you had to receive it. If you hadn't received it, you would be dead this very moment. Think about that. The Lord is offering you eternal life. An abundant life with him. You have everything to gain. And absolutely nothing to lose. All you have to do is ask. - Man. Things sure have been happening fast for me lately. But if this is the way God works, it sure is powerful. The way he used a crisis to bring on something good. I believe it. I believe it. I'm ready to accept Christ. - Oh boy. Could we lick the beaters when you get done? - Yeah, you can lick the beaters. - I hope I get a corner piece with lots of icing. Swirly icing, and there would be three sides with icing. - Sue, would you run next door and ask Mrs. Thompson if I could borrow a stick of butter? - Okay. But you be sure to be here when I get back. - Don't worry, sweetie. If I'm gone, you'll be gone too. (ominous music) (razor buzzing) (motor running) - [Reporter] Believe the situation. Never before has an emergency like this one been contemplated. Airports have stopped all flights. In New York alone, three large jets reported have crashed. One at take off, killing an estimated 56 persons. In California, meanwhile, traffic on all major freeways has come to virtually a stand still. Due to pile ups where drivers disappeared. Leaving their vehicles to the mercy of passengers. This is just in from central news agency. The UN has established a special emergency committee and will be making an unprecedented worldwide radio and telecast at noon today. And the purpose of this broadcast will be to assess the worldwide situation and establish methods and procedures in handling possible problems and danger facing the world as we know it today. Now be sure to tune in either your radio or television at 12 noon eastern time, 11 o'clock central time. On UTN, the United Television Network. - Ladies and gentlemen, as I speak to you this day, my words are being translated into every major tongue and dialect in the world. This morning, the United Nations met in emergency session. And formed the organization you see represented by this symbol. UNITE. The United Nations Imperium of Total Emergency. The Imperium is designed to exercise total power for as long as the emergency exists. And as yet, no final judgment has been made as to the exact nature of the emergency. But UNITE is anxious that until such judgment has been made, all feelings of panic and fear be held incheck. The Imperium is made up of leaders. From 10 major world powers. Consisting of six committees. From within those countries of six members each. You can be sure that the Imperium are taking absolute control over all government during this emergency will truly represent your feelings and needs. It is because of this potential threat to our entire planet that this one world government, the Imperium has been formed. And each member of the world council wishes to assure those of his fellow citizens that as soon as the emergency is passed, we will return to self rule for all nations. (dramatic music) The Imperium in no way wishes to infringe upon the rights of the citizens of the world. It is just a simple necessity that each of us identify with UNITE and fully support its progress and strategy. Before the emergency, we were at each other's throats. Let unity be the positive result of our common dilemma. Report today to your local UNITE identification center and show yourself a true citizen of the world. (dramatic music) - [Man] Name. - [Woman] Brit Matney. - [Man] Address. - 7110 Oliver Smith. - Zone. - 25. - Back of the hand or forehead? - Will it wash off? - No, it's permanent. - Back of the hand. - Put it right there. I'm not afraid to be a good citizen. - Name. - Ernie Gibhard. - Address. - 1334 East Old Park. - Zone. - Zone 50. (dramatic music) (people chattering) (car honking) - It can only be assumed by the Imperium that those in civilized centers of the world who refuse to be identified are working against the goals and purposes of the Imperium. Perhaps even in cooperation with the forces which brought about the emergency. It is therefore been declared by our leaders that in the interest of world safety, all people who do not bear the mark of UNITE are subject to arrest and prolonged inconvenience. The Imperium wishes all citizens to ... - God. Why didn't I? It's all happening just like I thought it would. (door knocking) (dramatic music) - Oh, God. Are you really gone? Is your Holy Spirit really gone? Are we alone? - Reverend Turner. - Patty. Are you one of them? - Them? - UNITE. - No. - But you're still here. Another one. Oh God. - Another? - How many? How many have I misled? How many are still here because of me? It was all there. I read it, I studied it. I preached it. I preached it. Really didn't matter. How many? Still here because of me. I can't eat. I can't sleep. All I can think about are, all I can see are those faces. That were out there every Sunday. God. How many? - You don't have a mark? - I had it in my heart before it ever happened. - That's not good enough, let's go. - You. - [Patty] I swear! (dramatic music) - Now, young lady, what's your problem? - What? - They said that you don't want to identified. I suspect there's some sort of misunderstanding. - I know what's going on, and it's evil. Maybe too late for me. But I'm not going to join it. - There now, you see there was a misunderstanding. Hey, you're one of those religious people, aren't you? You think the emergency is something called the rapture. And UNITE's a world wide powerful evil. The beast. - You know about that? - Oh, of course. Over when the emergency happened, every possible explanation was explored by computer. And frankly, that explanation was high on the list. That we've since ruled it out. Does this look like a 666 to you? - Look, I'm not that stupid. I know that's a computer read out for 666. - Well, Reverend Turner doesn't believe that. He's come to see that this terrible evil doesn't exist. - Reverend Turner? - Certainly, we talked to him earlier this morning. And he's come to see that joining us is really an everyone's best and good interest. - Reverend Turner? - [Woman] You just come along with me, young lady. (dramatic music) Guards! Guards, guards! (dramatic music) - Diane. (suspenseful music) I don't know, downtown. Yeah. The dam? How am I gonna get to the dam? I don't even ... Okay, Jerry, well, be ... Okay, tell him. Tell him I'll get there, just wait. (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) (helicopter whirring) (dramatic music) (helicopter whirring) (slow rhythmic music) (helicopter whirring) (dramatic music) (helicopter whirring) (dramatic music) ♫ Change your mind ♫ The son has come and you've been left behind ♫ There's no time to change your mind ♫ How could you have been so blind ♫ The father spoke ♫ The demons died ♫ The son has come and you've been left behind ♫ You've been left behind ♫ You've been left behind ♫ You've been left behind - Okay, all units, we've got her safe in our arms. - [Man On Radio] Roger, we copy that, 10-4. (dramatic music) - [Man] These people will not be able to get away anywhere. And there will be no place to hide. (dramatic music) There will be no place to hide. There will be no place to hide. And these people will not be able to get away anywhere. And there will be no place to hide. (ominous music) There will be no place to hide. - [Reporter] Reports keep coming in from all over the globe confirming it as true. To say that the world is in a state of shock this morning would be to understate the situation. The event seems to have taken place at the same time all over the world. Just about 25 minutes ago. Suddenly and without warning, literally thousands, perhaps millions of people just disappeared. - Jim! - [Reporter] A few eyewitness accounts of these disappearances ...
