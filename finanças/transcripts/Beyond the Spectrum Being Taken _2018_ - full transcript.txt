The number of UFO sightings in Canada is soaring ten fold over the past 25 years. UFO over China, according to reports, an airport in inner Mongolia was forced to shut down to prevent passenger jets from crashing into the unidentified flying object. The craft I saw was silver in color, it was round, it did come down on the ground even though I didn't see it on the ground, I saw the marks that it left later on that day. Right out in front of us was this huge craft. I felt this energy go through me, it's like nothing I've ever experienced before in my life, it's like some sort of low level frequency that came in waves but it was so dense that I could actually physically feel it going through my body. And they came charging across the field. It was just like we were paralyzed, he couldn't move and I couldn't move, but these three robot looking creatures floated out, they didn't walk, they just kind of glided out of the craft and came over and took out a hold of me and one got a hold of Charlie and they took us inside, they did an examination. They put us back out at the same place we were, facing the water. When it took off, it didn't make hardly any noise at all. You just heard like a zipping noise, zip. And that was it, it was gone. I'm a nuclear physicist, I want the facts, that's what I want is evidence, and I also say sometimes you have to keep a gray basket, I call it, not black, not white, people want a yes or no answer to everything. Well sometimes you have to say I don't have enough data. Who knows? Things are complicated, UFOs aren't simple things. Human beings are addicted to war. One of the fundamental things going on and the reasons for their presence here is intervention. Don't think of this as some kind of sci-fi magical wowie zowie sort of thing, shock and awe. I'm just saying just think of them as these people from way over there that we don't know too much about. Is alien abduction cool or is it a terrible experience? Are aliens really taking us or is this just dreams and hallucinations? Is abduction even still a thing? Why don't we hear as much about it these days? Although Hollywood normally depicts alien abduction in a horrifying light, abduction stories, positive and negative have been told by hundreds if not thousands of people. Is this experience something unreal that we've created in our minds or is this actually part of our collective reality? It's no secret that mainstream scientists for the most part totally reject the idea that aliens are actually physically abducting people. The supposed lack of hard evidence being their main argument, however, there's also been alleged trace evidence from the landing of ET craft. That has been measurable on the electromagnetic spectrum. Dozens, if not hundreds of people have had supposed alien implants removed from their bodies, some of which possess unexplainable properties, such as the ability to emit radio signals. There appear to be some highly advanced iron metal matrix composite with carbon nanotubes. Yeah, we were able to back engineer some of the technology that we have in these devices. We can prevent, for example, inflammatory processes and rejection, in other words, if we can make something similar, you can wrap a heart and kidney, screw a pin, or whatever and install it in the human body and the person would not have to take any antirejection medication for the rest of their life. Dr. Roger Leir was a world renowned surgeon who was known for having removed over a dozen of what he believed to be alien implants. We've looked at drawings, cave paintings and wood carvings that have been in existence for thousands of years but people have been looking for the so called smoking gun, and that's what we seem to have found. Now, almost all skeptics of the phenomemon do agree that many people who report abductions do seem like they are mentally stable individuals who clearly believe that their experiences were real, which means there are only two possibilities for those types of supposedly sane abductees. Either they are mentally stable and somehow gravely mistaken about something extraordinary that didn't actually happen to them or it actually happened to them. Many people, including those who produced the recent Netflix documentary, The Nightmare, often try to attribute the entire alien abduction phenomenon to sleep paralysis. Many people want to assume that this type of fear based hallucination could explain alien abduction as a whole. However, there have been plenty of alien contact cases that supposedly occurred when people were wide awake. Betty and Barney Hill, Travis Walton or even all the military personnel from around the world who say they've seen UFOs or crashed craft. All stories that have nothing to do with lying in bed at night. Sleep paralysis always involves the experiencer lying in bed and being fully aware of their bedroom surroundings. It does not include being present on an alien ship. And although sleep paralysis may include feeling a malevolent presence, it's actually very rare that you'll hear people interpret that as aliens. But let's entertain every single possibility of what alien abduction could also be. Is there a chemical reaction that might occur in the brain that simply creates a hallucination that looks and feels like you're being abducted by aliens? Some unnamed form of schizophrenia based on your collective unconscious paranoias of what we think aliens might look like? And if that is a real illness, why don't we have a name for it? These so called memories of the abduction experience are usually very vivid and detailed, and unless you are psychotic, what other form of mental illness could you be suffering from if even skeptics say that you seem mentally sane when reporting alien abductions? If this is a form of schizophrenia, how does that explain physical symptoms like supposed burns, scarring, and puncture marks? If the phenomemon is a result of environmental factors, why have we still not figure out what those factors are and why they cause these hallucinations? If this is a mass deception, a deliberately created falsehood and distraction, who is orchestrating it and for what purpose, or is this just something that only psychodynamics or psychopathology can explain? Are people simply making it all up in mass, just because they seek attention? While it's fair to assume that could be the case for people who have chosen to make a living off of their supposed encounters with aliens, there are many people who have not embraced it in such a financially fruitful way and therefore have had nothing to gain from telling people this happened to them, because your average neighborhood acquittance would not believe it. And just as it may be impossible to prove that they're telling the truth, it may be just as impossible to prove that they're lying. The conclusion that usually closes the book on alien abduction for most people is that explanation that the entire phenomemon is the result of some kind of mass suggestibility or fantasy proneness. Now, while false memory syndrome is a real condition where a person recalls memories that never happened, usually fear based or even traumatic ones that affect their relationships with other people, could that apply to groups of people who claim to have seen the same thing? And that could that account for such a vast and detailed experience? I was brought aboard the craft and I was put through different machines, but this one particular one, they took me in a room and put me on this rubber glass like wheel that turns around and around, they put something around my mouth, my ears, and there was water that dripped down on me as the wheel was whirling around and round. Are they humanoids? I mean, what do we call them? Well, they were gray beings about three to five feet tall. Wore tight fitting outfits, had very large eyes, no hair. Tiny holes for ears and nose and a slit like mouth. Did they speak to you? I mean, we're.. (Mumbles) Telepathy. The last one was April 11th. This year. That's correct. What happened? Well, I had a visit from several beings and there were also several humans present. Very often, with my experiences, they literally materialized in front of my eyes. You don't see spaceships. I have been inside of ships. What is extraordinary about it is the consistency of the stories among people who are of sound mind, who have come forth very reluctantly as Mary as, who doubt their own stories, who describe what they've gone through with great emotion. Are you saying then doctor that it happened to them or that they firmly believe it happened to them? Again, the hoping has made me reexamine all of these notions of happened and didn't happen. For them, it was completely real and it is not the product of mental illness. Now, whether it happened altogether in this reality, I don't know. Now, while scrolling through the Wikipedia page for the narrative of the abduction phenomemon, the details of the experience are so vast and well documented that it simply renders the hallucination claim unlikely, and when else in our history have we ever had a mass, widespread false memory syndrome like this? Could all of this really be some kind of complicated, yet very specific mass delusion? One that affects all five senses, the likes of which we have no agreeable scientific name for that somehow is almost always consistent with most of these variables? Or are there simply aliens visiting us? Do I speak for aliens? I've never met an alien. Stan Friedman is a nuclear physicist who worked on advanced classified aircraft and rocket programs for General Electric, General Motors, Westinghouse, and many more. Since 1970, Friedman has also been a professional ufologist and was the first civilian investigator of the Roswell incident, and he believes that we currently have the science to prove that interstellar travel is possible. The studies on interstellar travel, and I've known something about them because I worked on those studies. The science and technology that we know a great deal about tells us that if you play your cards right, you can go to the stars. It's gonna cost a tremendous amount of money, I'm not saying this is easy. Look, if I told you about an aircraft carrier that could operate for 18 years without refueling, you'd say you're crazy, Man. If I told you that 50 years ago, but it's real. This camera, if you told somebody you could do what this thing does 70 years ago, he'd have laughed his head off. Gigabytes? Come on, what are you talking about? Although alien abduction stories have been told by many American citizens, the official US air force word on UFOs is that they are not a threat to our national security and that has been the official word for over 60 years. I'm here to discuss the so called flying saucers. Since 1947, we have received and analyzed between one and 2000 reports. There's a great book of them. We've been able to explain them as hoaxes, as erroneously identified friendly aircraft, or as light aberration. However, there have been a certain percentage of this volume of reports that have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things. It is this group of observations that we now are attempting to resolve. We have as of date come to only one firm conclusion with respect to this remaining percentage, and that is that it does not contain any pattern of purpose or of consistency that we can relate with to any conceivable threat to the United States. That's an utterly absurd remark, that there is no national security aspect to UFOs. The most obvious one is technology. These are flying objects. We would love to build flying objects that could go up, down, back, forth, make right angle turns, fly silently. That's one national security aspect, just the high technology, but what would it do to our religion? What's the church gonna say if you say there are others out there? Obvious question, did Jesus die to save them? Impact on religion, impact on industry. Stories of alien abduction have been around for a lot longer than one might think. In 1896, Colonel H.G. Shaw claimed that while driving through the countryside near Stockton, he encountered a landed spacecraft and tall, slender humanoids whom when he approached, began attempting to abduct him. What's even stranger is that right after that event, within the next several months, eight additional separate UFO sightings supposedly occurred all over the United States. Two of them were crashes, two of them were landings, and four were flyovers, but the steak of events ended with the now famous Aurora Texas crash in April of 1897. 60 years later, in 1956, Elizabeth Klarer, a South African farmer, claimed to have been taken up into a mothership by ETs. In 1957, Antonio Viles Boes, a Brazilian farmer, claimed to have been dragged inside a craft by a humanoid wearing a gray jumpsuit and a helmet, but in 1961, an abduction case occurred that received more widespread attention than any one before it. Betty and Barney hill were driving through New Hampshire, returning from a vacation in Niagara Falls. They observed what they thought was a star until it began moving upwards, becoming bigger and brighter until it appeared as a craft with flashing multicolored lights. Like a lot of people might want to do, they decided to try to follow it. The Hills claim they observed the craft erratically bouncing back and forth in the night sky, passing over a restaurant and signal tower on top of Cannon Mountain. About a mile south of Indian Head, they claimed the craft rapidly descended towards their car and hovered over it. Barney supposedly got out of his car, looked into his binoculars, and actually saw eight to 11 beings standing in the windows of this craft who appeared not human. Barney panicked, running back to the car and telling Betty "They're going to capture us." As they drove away at high speed, the craft positioned itself right above their car. The Hills then heard rhythmic buzzing sounds that bounced off the trunk of the vehicle. After a tingling sensation passed through their bodies, they both experienced an altered state that left their minds dulled. After another series of buzzing sounds, they returned to normal consciousness with only foggy memories of what transpired earlier. Eventually arriving home around dawn, two hours later than they intended. I was 13 years old when this occurred. My mother was Betty's sister. Betty called my mother on the afternoon of September 20th, 1961, this is actually the day they returned from having had this close encounter with what they called a flying saucer in those days. She was very concerned that the craft had hovered so low over their vehicle that she feared that they might have been contaminated by cosmic rays, by radiation, by something. And so did I believe that? Of course I did, because they were concerned. They were worried. The very next day, Betty and Barney reported the event to Pease Air Force Base. They were interviewed by Major Paul W. Henderson who first determined that the Hills had misidentified the planet Jupiter, then, that it was an optical condition and eventually, it was labeled insufficient data. A month later, the Hills got in contact with Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member, Barney confided in Webb that he believed he developed a mental block and that there were parts of the event that he might have suppressed. Webb believed that they were telling the truth. Of course, there was physical evidence as well. Betty's dress was torn in several locations. Later, she discovered that it was covered with a pink powdery substance, there were shiny spots on the trunk of their vehicle that were magnetic, and I want to add also that this had a huge emotional impact upon Barney. Barney eventually had to take a leave of absence from work. The reason for that was that he developed bleeding ulcers and high blood pressure as a result of the trauma that he experienced. For the next three years, the Hills attempted to forget about the whole thing and move on with their lives. But Betty's strange dreams and Barney's anxiety led to their decision to undergo hypnotherapy. And they wound up with Dr. Benjamin Simon who was a psychiatrist but who was a world class expert on the uses of medical hypnosis to retrieve lost memories. They saw Dr. Simon almost on a weekly basis. He hypnotized them separately. The first thing that Barney remembered that he suppressed was exactly what happened when he looked through those binoculars at the hovering craft. What you are about to hear is the audio recording from Barney Hill's hypnosis sessions. Be advised, the quality is low and the content may be disturbing to younger viewers. Barney then recalls patchy memories of the aftermath, thinking they were stopped at a roadblock with men in black suits telling them to get out of their car. The men in suits supposedly led him and Betty away from their car and into the woods. He then remembers them being taken onto a craft, being put into two separate rooms and then being told to lie down on small, rectangular exam tables. They stuck a big needle in Betty's naval. And she screamed, it was painful, and the leader waved his hand and the pain stopped. They were apparently treated as specimens. Our examinations were very much similar in that with both Barney and I they checked our eyes, ears, nose, throat, took samples of our hair, fingernail, and they scraped our skin. The attempted to insert a needlelike instrument in my naval, he said it was a pregnancy test. It's easy to wave it away, oh, it's just baloney story but they were people with spotless reputations. All kinds of people testifying to their good character. Betty and Barney were credible people. She was a social worker for the state of New Hampshire. He worked for the post office, but he also later was appointed to the US Civil Rights Commission State Advisory committee, he was legal redress to the NAACP in that area. He was on the regional board. He received an award from Sergeant Shriver for the good work that he did for the US Poverty Program. He was politically involved and Betty was as well. They were credible people. Probably the most incredible and controversial thing about the story was Betty's claim that one of the aliens showed her a star map, one that after vigorous study would actually lend credibility to their story. She was asked by Dr. Simon to describe what the alien showed her, it was a woman named Marjorie Fish who did the important research. Marjorie was a member of MENSA and she decided to build three dimensional models of our local galactic neighborhood. The stars in their right locations hung on string and she built a total of more than 20 of those. She finally found one pattern that matched, angle for angle, line length with line length, with what Betty had drawn, and it turns out that the bay stars were Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli. It's the constellation of Reticula. They both are sunlike stars, it was an exciting piece of work, I published an article about it. Astronomy Magazine did an article about it. That work is worthy of our attention. My investigation was extensive. I had Betty to interview, I played Devil's advocate, I had all of the archival records, including the project Blue Book report, including letters to and from scientists who were interested in this case, who investigated it. Also the lab reports, and I found over and over again information that led me to believe that it really was a true abduction experience. Kathleen also believes that she herself has been abducted by aliens. It was February of 1966 and my mother, my grandmother, my brother, a family friend and I observed a UFO and it was hovering fairly low in the sky, it headed toward a lake near my home, we drove to that lake and we had a close encounter with that craft. In April of that year, only a couple of months after that happened, a craft landed on my grandparents' farm. I grew up across the street from them. A neighbor or ours who was a commercial pilot returning home from work saw it coming in as well and I believe that that is probably the first time that I was taken. I was on that table, there were entities around me. At that time, I was afraid of doctors and I was wondering if I had undergone some kind of operation during the night and maybe it was arranged so that I wouldn't be so frightened. I was terrified and I was terrified for many years. I wouldn't talk to anyone about it and I kept that terror inside, and here I am now and for the first time actually speaking about it on camera. And I think that it's time. I couldn't, in my mind for so many years see the faces of those entities, somehow it was blocked. But I did undergo hypnosis and I did remember that those were nonhuman entities standing around the table. I was 17. Kathleen believes the the entities were likely the same as those supposedly seen by her aunt and uncle. I believe the the reason that craft landed on my grandparents' farm is that Betty was doing contact experiments with a group of scientists. They would write a script, mail it to her, and she was to repeat the same words over and over again for a two or three week period, for example, land at such and such a street or come down close and we will be out looking for you and I think that these entities probably thought that she had invited them to meet the family. One of the most common questions asked by skeptics in the UFO field is why don't they just land? Why don't they ever land? They land all the time, Ted Philips in Missouri's looked at thousands of physical trace cases from 80 countries. These cases are all over the place. When a debunker says why don't they land, that means he hasn't studied the data. Why in the world would they? The president does not rule planet Earth. I hope you understand that. The notion that if aliens were coming here, well, of course they'd land on the White House lawn, where else would you go? And say we're here to kill you, save you, whatever the message is, they're obviously not here for that purpose. For telling us hey guys, here we are kind of thing. Society, generally speaking, acts in its own interests. We have spies to find out what our enemies are doing so they don't surprise us. One reason why we're not seeing more UFO landings these days may be due to that fact that we've been constantly shooting at them. The first recorded incident was in 1942, the Battle of Los Angeles, where a bright orange UFO was seen hovering over the LA area. After a blackout was ordered throughout the entire country, the coast artillery brigade fired over a thousand anti-aircraft shells at the UFO. They never actually hit the craft, which is interesting, but there were five civilian casualties as a result of the barrage. Anti-aircraft guns went into action against unidentified aircraft in the Los Angeles area shortly after three AM, Pacific wartime this morning. US Army planes quickly took to the dark skies, but whether they contacted the object has not been announced. Concussion of the shells could be felt in downtown Los Angeles, 15 miles away. Shells frequently could be seen bursting near the object, but none appeared to have hit it. The shooting stopped about 3:30 AM. More recently, in 1997, while stationed in Peru, Lance Corporal Jonathon Weygandt reported finding a crashed craft with ETs inside that he claimed had been shot down by a missile. It was buried in the side of a cliff, and when I first saw it I was scared, it scared the heck out of me. And I didn't know what to do, in stinger school, they teach you about all different kinds of aircraft. Well, essentially what I saw, and I'm like man, this is nothing that I knew about. There was one light on it that slowly went around and the machine, I could hear it, I guess, 'cause it was still functioning and it had like a hum to it. Like say, if you unplug an amp from a guitar, kind of... It was shaped like almost, between an egg and a teardrop almost, it looked to be that it could have been handmade, but out of what, what materials, I don't know. But basically when I was down there with the ship, I felt this presence, I thought the creatures, they calling me and it was like weird and I think they were trying to communicate with me, I guess telepathically. It's really weird and I don't believe in any of that stuff. It's almost like if someone were reading your mind and that's the way it felt. I felt a presence, this was like supernatural. They were not gonna harm me and that was basically, that everything was gonna be all right, just help us get out of here. Oval egghead with big dark eyes, a nose and a small mouth, no ears, and I was sort of mesmerized and into it and sergeant Allen and Agnes were calling and they were cussing at me to get the hell out there. Weygandt claimed that after being next to the crashed ship for about 15 minutes, a gang of men from the department of energy showed up and arrested him and his sergeants. I was arrested, I had all my gear taken from me by men in black camis. They had the big D, Delta Ostera Echo on the back of their rain jackets. He claims he was then taken to a dark interrogation room, was handcuffed to a chair, and was psychologically tortured for over eight hours straight by an unnamed lieutenant colonel and several DOE employees. And they're yelling at me and they're hollering and cursing, "You didn't see anything, we'll do you "and your whole goddamn family," it was basically that for about eight or nine hours. I was sitting in a chair and I was handcuffed to a chair and I couldn't move, didn't (mumbles) accept it. These guys, they're just all in the room, there's no oversight, no control, they just do whatever they want. And they're evil, Man, these people are evil. This is definitely someone, NAATO or some multi-national deal. Weygandt strongly believes that the alien craft was shot down by the very weapons installation that he was tasked with guarding. What it looked like is it had been hit with maybe a service deer missile, because I had been in the command center, their radar installation, and I heard a couple women there in the air force talking about air craft flying in and out of the atmosphere at mach 10 plus. I think they knew it was coming in and they said we can't identify it, it's violating air space, they could have radioed the crew (mumbles) and take them out and then they shot them down. I was raised in a Christian home to believe there was a god and that he created everything in the universe and here they are, these creatures that I've never seen before, never come in contact with and this happens man, and it just made me almost crazy, not like suicidal, but I just couldn't, I had to reevaluate everything that I knew. And I was basically with these aliens, they were holding my hands and they had their hand, they only had four fingers by the way, probably the closest thing I can say that they were almost like angels. And if I had to, I'd go with them right now. I mean, and I had this obsession with that. I guess because of the pain of the experience in the Marine Corps that I just wanted to escape and I was thinking about being with these creatures a lot and wanting to go with them, wanting to get out of here. I mean, I'm not doing this to make money or publicity or anything but I think it needs to be told, I think people need to hear it. If alien visitation is actually occurring as is believed by followers of Ufology, what exactly is their reason for being here in the first place? Many people who study UFOs believe that a lot more ETs began visiting Earth after we developed atomic energy and started going into space. That, they say, is when we became dangerous. We are a threat to the neighborhood, let's look at some facts. A big bomb in World War II was a 10 ton blockbuster and it released the energy of 10 tons of dynamite, 1944. 1945, first atomic bond, 15,000 tons of dynamite. First fusion device, 1952, 10 million tons of dynamite. And a Russian satellite, Sarbomba, about four years later, released the energy of 27 million tons of dynamite. One bomb. Human beings, they're addicted to war. One of the fundamental things going on and the reason for their presence here is intervention. We didn't need intervention when we made long bow, we didn't need it when we came up with gunpowder, we didn't need it when we came up with airplanes, but when we cracked the atom, we were definitely in the high throes of violent war addiction. The belief that aliens might be anti-nuclear or anti weaponry isn't just based on assumptions. UFOs have supposedly flown over missile silos and temporarily disarmed the stockpiles and this has been reported many times. We have a mounting evidence from scores of witnesses who had national security clearances as working on strategic missile bases which is a little harder job to get than I don't know, greeter at Wal-Mart, about these craft coming down over their facility and turning the missiles off, and we have evidence for that, it was written up. Do they melt them down so that they're useless? No, they turn them off. Can we turn them back on? Yeah, as soon as they leave. It's a pretty good message. Now it could be the message was just letting you know we're coming for you pretty soon and there's no point in trying to do anything because we can turn your missiles of so just bow down and accept as us your new leaders, okay? It's possible, but it doesn't fit in to the overall evidence picture at all. What are they telling you? Well, they're telling me a lot of things. One of the things they've told me consistently is that they care, they're not treating us as guinea pigs or human experiments, that there is some level of concern on their part of our well being. This is said in English by people who look like what? This is said telepathically, most of the communication that transpires between myself and them is telepathic. Do you, Mary, telepathically respond back to them? Yes I do. Have you ever asked them the basic, simple question, why didn't you land at the White House? No, I haven't asked them that. My concern is why do you come here to see me. And what do they tell you? The answer is because we care. They are attempting to send a strong message to human beings that we need to put our behavior in check. I telepathically asked why they had taken my family and they said that they have a concern about environmental toxicity, they have a concern that humans will no longer be able to reproduce, they are afraid that we could destroy ourselves and this planet. People who claim to have had contact with extraterrestrial frequently report receiving telepathic images of the Earth's destruction during the experience. These images are almost always interpreted as a warning of a possible cataclysm. It felt like they take them aside and they project messages and images into their head and these are images of destruction and desolation, environmental damage, war, whatever. With others, they are given information about the future of this planet, about their concerns. So they think they're being showed the accrual future, no, they're being showed a possible future. Now, Steven Bassett is a political activist and lobbyist for ufology. For over 20 years, he has been an outspoken advocate for acknowledgement and official government disclosure of information regarding the supposed ET presence. One of the things I learned late in life, which I wish I'd known when I was younger, is that there's almost no area that might interest you that you can't get involved in if you're willing to work for free. And so I had this idea wow, go to Washington and (mumbles) register as a lobbyist and then I set up the first political action committee on the issue and then I put the first exopolitics conference and that launched my political engagement. As Bassett has primarily dealt with high ranking military witnesses and government whistleblowers, he is not particularly known for discussing the topic of alien abductions. Stayed away from the contact aspect for years. I just didn't say anything about it, and the reason was just trying to get the press, to the political media, let alone anybody in Congress to address just the fact that ETs are here, which is a big deal. I knew that trying to get them to address abduction, their heads would explode, so I just didn't do it. To not talk about this is like ignoring these people exist. I don't lecture on it, that's not my specialty, but I have given a lot of thought to the contact record that we have which is huge. Anne Strieber got 500,000 letters came into them and she wrote a book called The Communion Letters. And these are coming in unsolicited from people that have read the books and are going this has happened to me and here's what happened, I don't get paid, there's no fame involved, it was just the private letters. So what are the other prominent tales of alien abduction that have not yet been debunked? On November fifth, 1975, Travis Walton and six other loggers were out driving through the Apache-Sitgreaves national forest, where they supposedly came upon a hovering craft of unknown origin. It's kind of like shining through a lampshade. Basically, it was kind of a yellowish glow to it, I mean, that's what it appeared to me. It had some kind of a round thing on top like a dome. Basically, it was very, very sleek. It was just absolutely beautiful. Travis exited the truck and went up to the craft, where he was allegedly hit with a beam of light that made his body levitate. And when I looked back, a few feet off the ground, and he's stretched out like this. After Travis fell onto the ground, the other men fled in fear, thinking he was dead. After police found no trace of Travis or the craft, five whole days went by with still no sign of him, and just about everyone in the small town of Snowflake, including some of their own family members had begun to assume that these young men had murdered Travis. One of those men was Travis's best friend. A week later, Travis's brother-in-law gets a call from a payphone. The voice on the other line tells him it's Travis. His brother Dwayne rushes to go get him and bring him home. Well, it is frustrating to encounter that degree of ignorance, but back in 1975, the debunkers sort of had the upper hand, because they would call people a kook for believing in something that was in disfavor with the majority of science, scientists. But now, just recently, NASA confirmed on the basis of direct observation that virtually every star has about a dozen planets. The number of potential civilizations in our galaxy is so vast that now, anyone who thinks we're alone in the universe gets the definition of a kook. They're believing something contrary to the available scientific evidence. In the days following Travis's return, all six men took polygraph tests to try and prove that they were telling the truth about what happened. They all passed, except one that was inconclusive. They were under suspicion of foul play. They needed to prove their innocence and they were asked about whether or not they saw something that they believed was an unidentified flying object and they passed that part of the test as well. After passing the polygraph test, Steve Pierce comes to his mom and says "I told you we didn't kill him." And to have to say something like that to your own mother. And she would have never thought he was a murderer if it was any other subject, it was just that the idea of aliens was just so resisted that there's gotta be some other way to explain it, even if my son is guilty of something horrible. In hindsight, you could see that a lot of this negative reaction was just based on their own fear. They hoped to hell it isn't true, they wish it wasn't true, so people wanted to believe things like that they we were crazy or I was crazy or that this was a drug hallucination. I had a blood and urine test put through the Maricopa County medical examiner's drug screen, proving there wasn't a trace of any drug in my body. Same thing with the temporary insanity thing. I had a battery of psychiatric tests that proved to be a totally normal pattern of scores. Now, as much as we all love to talk about and reference Wikipedia, the site is clearly biased against Travis Walton. In the media and publicity section, they sum up his 40 year fame into just Fire in the Sky and a few TV appearances, mainly the Moment of Truth, where Travis was set up to fail a fake lie detector test in front of a live TV audience. No mention of the near dozen documentaries made about him, including the latest Travis, which won so many awards, the cover is literally covered in them. No mention that he has lectured about ETs and his experience for decades and that him and everyone who has known him through the years also still stick to their story. This page doesn't even mention the fact that Travis was missing for five days. Police and search parties could not find him. The only real analysis of his experience that exists on this page is this section, the so called skeptical reception, which is just two paragraphs dedicated to the opinions of Philip Klass and Michael Shermer, two very biased people who happen to be professional UFO debunkers. Now, while Michael Shermer does have a respected career as a historian and author of skepticism, these days, his views on the UFO phenomemon tend to not go much further than saying that some of them are balloons. After investigating the case, class reported that the polygraph tests were poorly administered, used countermeasures such as holding his breath. That's not reporting, just speculating a theory. Uncovered an earlier failed test that concluded gross deception, with a whopping five references. Two of those references are just people saying they heard that from Phil Klass. Maybe the National Enquirer test was the one that was poorly administered and the one that was forced to them at the jailhouse by the Arizona department of public safety was the more accurate test. The man who administered the test even admitted that he wanted them to fail, and they didn't, to his surprise. There was one young man, he was the youngest of the group, so he's the one I wanted to choose first and frankly, when I finished with him, I was quite surprised myself because he was passing the exam. Phil Klass also claimed that Travis Walton wrote the questions himself and submitted them. That is also not true. I designed the questions, the entire test is established by research from Dr. Raskin, that was University of Utah. Travis claims that he even made an offer to Phil Klass to take another polygraph test, to which Klass either ignored or just declined. Since then, Travis has taken 16 different lie detector tests, no mention of that fact either. The Michael Shermer paragraph simply speculates that Travis based his hoax on the Betty and Barney Hill TV movie. Travis claims he never saw it, and with those two baseless theories, the entire case is closed on Wikipedia. This poor attempt at debunking is the definition of gross deception. Skeptics consider it a hoax. Look, we've go five references. In reality, these five references are a hoax. Four and five are both Phil Klass, three is Susan Clancy who is also problematic since she wrote a book about abductees but mostly interviewed people who were making it up, two is another person just saying that they heard Phil Klass say it was a hoax, and one is the statement by the sheriff where he said he believed that the five companions saw Travis get hit with a beam of light from the ship, he just couldn't believe Travis's part about being on the ship. But there's not a single mention of this first paragraph of the fact that most people who have actually studied this case do not think it's a hoax. Some ufologists believe Walton was abducted by aliens. It's actually quite fair to say that nearly all ufologists believe that he was abducted by aliens. Allegedly passed polygraph tests. Either you pass it or you don't, which one was it? So why is the Travis Walton Wikipedia page so co-opted by Phil Klass? Stanton Friedman, Kathleen Martin, and Travis Walton himself all believe that Philip Klass was hired or at least encouraged by the FBI to debunk Travis. Kathleen even claims to have evidence of that. Our latest book, Stanton Friedman and I have written Fact, Fiction, and Flying Saucers. It's based upon years of archival research. He went to Harvard, read Donald Mendzel's archival files. I went to the American Philosophical Society, I made several trips there, and what I found in the correspondence files was a plan to debunk those individuals who had very compelling cases and also to attempt to reduce the credibility of scientists who had an interest in investigating UFOs and who were speaking publicly about that. I have a letter that Dr. Edward Condon wrote to McGraw-Hill, and in that letter, Condon stated, "If you need anyone "in the media to make public statements about UFOs, I would "advise you to use Philip Klass." Steve Pierce, one of the men who saw Travis get hit by the beam of light from the craft, claims that Phil Klass actually came to his house alone one day where he says Klass offered him 10,000 dollars to start publicly stating that the whole thing was a hoax. It was like Phil Klass offered me 10,000 dollars, that was a lot of money back in the 70s. We cannot turn a blind eye to the Travis Walton case. The evidence is too compelling. If I could go back, I would not get out of the truck. I wish that I had my life back, that I could have had a career as a normal person. But I mentioned earlier that I think I'm making progress in terms of educating people and gaining acceptance. When I tell people, don't think of this as some kind of sci-fi, magical wowie zowie sort of thing, shock and awe, I'm saying just think of them as these people from way over there that we don't know too much about. And they actually seem kind of disappointed with that point of view, I think a lot of people are attracted to the idea of making some kind of razzle dazzle sci-fi thing out of it, but I try to keep it down to Earth and just keep it in perspective. Well, someone did make a sci-fi razzle dazzle thing out of it. The 1997 film Fire in the Sky, which is based entirely on Travis Walton. Well, not entirely. The movie portrays Travis's experience as a horrifying nightmarish ordeal, akin to something out of Ridley Scott's alien franchise, but according to Travis, his experience was nothing like that and he believes the aliens he encountered were actually benevolent. Well, from the very time I first realized what they had done with the script for Fire in the Sky, I was aware of the fictionalization and the departures from how it was. Now, initially, when I was given a copy of the script, the alterations, the changes from happened, those parts of the script were not in the script I was given, they were just omitted. So it kind of caught me by surprise, they knew in advance that I was not gonna be too happy with that. And those kind of fictionalizations were not helpful, but it did actually put people emotionally, to vicariously experience what we went through with the sort of public response, suspicion, all those kinds of things, people did identify with that and it did make a great deal of progress, it did, it helped out. It put people in a position to understand for once what we went through, from our point of view. So although it was less than perfect, it was still something that overall, to sum it all up was better than it happened than not, but there's been quite a bit of interest expressed in doing a more accurate remake of it. I think the time is right for that. (Mumbles) eventually happen and I look forward to that. One major obstacle that stands in the way of many people trying to wrap their heads around this topic is the constant debate of who is telling the truth and who isn't. Many would agree that the credibility of the abduction phenomenon has been very negatively affected by the overabundance of hoaxes and fake accounts. But not every hoax was meant to be taken as fact. In 1989, a decade before the Blair Witch project, a found footage horror film was released straight to video, titled UFO Abduction. The film was created to appear as a genuine home video of a family's last moments before being abducted by aliens. Not only did the film take the world by storm, but many people believed that it was a genuine home video, due to the realism and improvisational nature of the film. I knew I wanted to improvise the dialogue but I knew I also had to work for some form of structure, so I created a 10 page, 20 feet outline. It was pretty much all shot in one take, and a few years later, apparently someone had edited off the credits and passed it around the UFO community as a real thing so it ends up at the international UFO and Congress Convention. I didn't know any of this and then there were a few shows that wanted to do specials on it. Unsolved Mysteries was one of them and this one show called Encounters for Fox, and then there was a big kind of viral thing that happened. After Unsolved Mysteries aired an entire episode dedicated to pretending that the fake abduction film was in fact real, the belief that it was spread quickly. No matter how much I told them look, it's a fake film that we did, the more I shouted out the truth to them, the more embedded the conspiracies got. And they were wide ranging. They went from me being hired by the government to create this film or to put my name on it, that I had done it. On the cover of the UFO Abduction DVD box, there is a quote from Lt. Colonel Donald Ware that says "I am not convinced this thing is a hoax." I am not convinced the thing is a hoax because I know that our government policy is to insert this information into every major UFO case or release the document, or possibly every home video that gets on the market. I really don't fault people for believing that the film is real, not at all, it's a huge compliment to the cast and crew. What I do fault them about is not believing the filmmaker, not believing me. When you're showing pictures, behind the scenes pictures, its like game over, it's done, this is the reality, Guys. Except that when people say no, no, no, he could have had it doctored, he could have been this or that, now you're just making shit up. I mean, I've been outing myself for a couple decades now. Nine years after the film was released, UPN expressed interest in doing a remake of it, also in found footage style. This is where Dean says things got much worse. The home video you are about to see documents an alleged case of alien abduction. A family from Lake County, Minnesota was reported missing by relatives on Thanksgiving Weekend. I kept saying can't we use the original? Why don't we just show that and put it on the network? But no, they wanted to redo everything and they also put in music, which was not supposed to have music. Where are you going? Coming with you. No you're not. I just don't think you should go out there by yourself. Alien abduction, is it fact or fiction? And the most offensive thing they did is that the new person who came in, this woman who had came in to cut it down to an hour, she put in real interviews, so you have UFO luminaries like Dr. Stanton Friedman, Yvonne Smith, you have all these top people in the field of ufology and intercut into the movie, it looks like they're talking about my film and they're lending credibility to it and so it became this thing that was really 100% not cool. Insidious is probably too strong a word, but it was just a gross misrepresentation of what this thing was supposed to be. Although Dean's film made him an originator of the found footage horror genre, he says that he finds remorse with what the film did to the credibility of ufology since a lot of people thought it was real. At the end of the day, I feel bad 'cause I don't want to hijack anyone's belief system, I don't want to deteriorate it. We already have enough credibility issues in this field. We don't need anymore. I so believe that people have seen aliens. I believe that as strong as I can without having seen them myself. The Zimbabwe, 1994 aerial school, that's hardcore shit. 62 students up close, three feet away, and here we are 24 years later and these kids all, they're grown now, they all believe in what happened and they haven't changed their story one iota. Whether in TV shows or in movies, entertainment media has been quick to jump on the angle that alien visitation is a negative, predatory event. Sure, that makes for higher stakes in movies, but is that really the case with these supposed alien abduction events? John E. Mack was a Pulitzer prize winning author and Harvard psychiatrist who engaged in a decade plus study of alien abduction, starting in the early 1990s. John Mack studied around 200 men and women who claimed to have been abducted, and he remains one of the most esteemed academic figures to have studied the phenomemon. John Mack never definitively said that he thought aliens are definitely taking people, but he did say, quote, that "There's a compelling, powerful phenomemon here "that I can't account for in any other way "that is mysterious, and it seems to me that it invites "a deeper further inquiry," end quote. Mack had a particular interest in the spiritual and transformational aspects of alien encounters, and the idea that abduction could expand our notion of reality. The last book he wrote was titled passport to the cosmos where he talked to and studied various abductees who claim to have had a positive and even transcendent abduction experience. Now, being a Harvard psychiatrist who believed that there was something to alien abduction was no easy task. In May of 1994, the dean of Harvard Medical School appointed an investigation into Mack and the committee chairman, Arnold Relman, suggested that quote, "To communicate in any "way whatsoever to a person who has reported a close "encounter with an extraterrestrial life form "is professionally irresponsible," end quote. But once word got out that the investigation was taking place, other people in the academic community started questioning the ethics of such an investigation and it was eventually dropped, and the dean reaffirmed that Mack had the freedom to study whatever he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment. But over 20 years later, that attitude has not changed among scientific academia, and the topic is still very much considered taboo and unworthy of any real study. Most ufologists would say the number one reason for that resistance is fear of the unknown. Some people are very skeptical because they can't handle it emotionally and I have a background in psychiatric social work, I can understand if people are frightened about this and certainly in the media, it has been portrayed as something very, very frightening in the past. I don't think these entities, most of them are that frightening, I think that they're concerned about humanity. The Betty and Barney Hill story has been portrayed as being very frightened and perhaps negative in the mainstream media. Betty and Barney were initially very frightened, but those entities on the craft reassured Betty and Barney over and over again that no harm would be done. And they even apologized to Betty for frightening her. I do not think that they had malevolent intent. I do know that some types do appear not to have human interest in mind, I've worked on many cases of this type but this is not true of the group that my family has encountered. From the contact reports, which again, there's a spectrum of accounts and out on the wings here, they can get pretty wild and crazy, naturally, as you get wilder and crazier, you have to be a lot more skeptical. There's no question they're doing it, they have advanced genetic technology, but it may be far more than that and where things get very intense is the mounting evidence for hybrid work. Hybrids are a crossbreed of humans and extraterrestrials. Being involved in breeding experiments is an extremely common trait among abduction experiencers. If you just search alien hybrids on Amazon, you will see hundreds of books written about this subject. Many of them are fiction, but there are dozens if not several hundred that are supposedly based on actual experiences of people involved in these experiments. Is the supposed hybrid program an attempt by the ETs to help themselves, or to help humanity? That's kind of the top of the phenomenology period. I will mention it on camera, but I'm not out there beating the media over the head about this. There's just too much evidence that they're creating hybrid children, hybrid entities, with humans. Is there evidence that they're mining our gold? No. Sucking our water out of the oceans, no. Taking our atmosphere, no. I think that the majority of these nonhumans are benevolent, that they're concerned about our planet and they are concerned about the continuation of the human race. I think that we might have been a science project and that they have come back historically, periodically to check up on us. If people have difficulty with it as individuals and they don't wanna believe it, that's fine with me. It is the professional debunker and disinformants that I have a problem with, who will speculate about what might have happened and their speculation is entirely different from the truth of what happened. Well, what was recovered was a radar target, aluminum board. That is the cover story that was put out, we know it was a cover story based on the testimony of the people who put out the cover story. General Thomas Dubois was the Chief of Staff of the eighth air force, Fort Worth Army Air Field, General Raymes, Chief of Staff, General Dubois told us that the balloon story that Phil insists upon taking about was a cover story put out by the government simply to get the report.. (Mumbles) Philip, are you a debunker of all UFO stories? Is that your purpose? Well, I look for explanations. Although Philip Klass regularly dismissed claims of ET visitation, he has been quoted saying that 98% of people who report seeing UFOs are intelligent, honest people who have seen something. The other 2%, he says, are frauds. I believe that having debunkers in the UFO field is not necessarily a necessary evil as much as they're necessary. We need to have bullshit called out. Where I have issues is with the tactics that some people use that are debunking, and so if you're debunking things because you genuinely wanna get to the truth and wanna pull the curtain back on fraud, awesome. If you're doing it because you're trying to make a name for yourself and you know that it's super easy to go out and say this is bullshit because you're saying UFOs and aliens by virtue of UFOs and aliens, you're an asshole. Love Bill Nye, but his explanation that he's co-opted from the government about Roswell is moronic. High space weather balloons that hadn't been seen before, just stop, if you don't have anything that you can credibly add to it, that's okay. But I do think that we need people who will challenge what's being said, because there is a lot of bullshitters out there. People like Travis Walton who I've got a chance to meet and hang out with and do a podcast with, they don't get more credible than him. I definitely believe that he experienced something. The only mention of any scientific study on the Travis Walton Wikipedia page was the quick mention of a book written by Susan Clancy where she decided that Travis probably just got inspired by the Betty and Barney Hill TV movie and fabricated the event based on that. Susan Clancy is a cognitive psychologist and professor in consumer behavior in the INCAE Business School. In regards to her 2005 book, Abducted: How People Come to Believe They were Kidnapped By Aliens, Clancy's major conclusion is that the abductees she studied were all suffering from some kind of false memory syndrome. She even goes into detail of how she thinks a person could very easily conjure a false memory of being experimented on by otherworldly creatures, and many critics found her studies to be convincing and satisfying in closing the book for them on alien abduction. However, Clancy admitted that the majority of people she studied only had an inkling that they were abducted by aliens and didn't actually have any specific memory that it had occurred. Meanwhile, there are plenty of supposed abductees who do claim to have vivid and detailed memories of the event. In an interview with NPR to promote her book, Clancy made the claim that nobody reported being abducted before they actually saw it on TV, citing The Outer Limits as the earliest example that likely started it all, which first aired in 1963. Meanwhile, there have been plenty of abduction stories that occurred well before the television was a household appliance. Colonel H.G. Shaw in 1897, the Paris abduction of 1921, the so called Shaver mystery of 1943, the list goes on and on. I read Susan Clancy's book and I was very disappointed because I expected a scientific approach to the problem and I didn't find one. She hadn't studied the cases in detail, she hadn't studied them carefully, she hadn't studied the other studies and I was disappointed 'cause I expected, she's a well educated person. Clancy claims that those she studied who did in fact have memories of being abducted were all just the results of memory distorting processes such as undergoing hypnosis, however, there have been plenty of accounts that people did not need hypnosis to recall. The witnesses to Travis Walton's abduction were fully awake for just one example. The first part of Betty and Barney Hill's encounter did not require hypnosis to recall. Robert Fulford's review of Clancy's book in the National Post sums it up by saying she asks why mentally superior aliens haven't anything better to do than hang around North America stealing our genes, simply ignoring the fact that there have been plenty of stories of alien visitation outside of North America, not every abduction is genetic related, and to think that they should have something better to do than to be here, this person has clearly not studied the supposed reasons for them being here, which is surprising, considering she claims to have interviewed a bunch of abductees. And as for the distorted hypnosis claim, if you believe that the entire alien phenomemon, people really thinking that they experienced physically being on a craft is all just the result of suggestion through some botched hypnosis, couldn't that then be considered some kind of advanced psychological warfare? Having the ability to convince someone that they were on a craft being experimented on by aliens? That's a weapon, and if people actually have these memories, something that even skeptics admit is possible, could our military be using that warfare on our own citizens? Is there a deep conspiracy of humans that want us to think aliens are experimenting on us? Because they are actually the ones who are doing so. Or is there nobody experimenting on us? And we all just really badly want there to be? Just as it's important to keep an open mind, it's also important to remain skeptical, actually skeptical, not Wikipedia's definition. I have investigated cases where they were simply hoaxes. For example, there was a case in Idaho, a young man and a young woman. The craft had come down, had taken the young woman, that he engaged in fisticuffs, trying to fight off these entities but they dragged her onto the craft and I said gee, that doesn't sound like any real case that I've ever investigated. It has no had an effect upon the remainder of my investigations because I know that some individuals have compelling evidence. From all of that, all of the research that have been reviewing the accounts that have come forward, keeping in mind that some of them are conflated, some of them may be bogus, but that overlapping knowledge is where we developed a picture about the ETs, what they do and that's pretty important information. I will say I have no doubt at this point in my life that we are not alone. It's real and people need to realize that. I don't care about what their society runs on, I'm saying they're here, that's evidence enough that you can get here. So many people have reported alien abduction in such great detail that there really has never been anything like it in our history. If this is a mass delusion, when else have we had a mass delusion like it? To quickly believe that all abduction stories are true would be foolish, but to ignore the issue altogether would be burying our heads in the sand. It was stationary, this thing, and it was bright silver in color and had a dome. I could see the occupants in it. You saw people in it. I saw people in it, there were two people in there. These people were beautiful people, that's the only way I can describe them. You weren't scared but it? Did you run indoors? I was petrified, I couldn't move, I couldn't move a muscle, I was paralyzed with fear. But when I looked back, I think it was an amazing thing to happen and for me to have seen it. They are of above average intelligence, they are of sound mind, so there is not indication of any kind of psychiatric condition that can account for this that I've been able to find. Do you, Mary, telepathically respond back to them? Yes, I do. And why do you think they don't materialize here? I think that perhaps society's not ready for this.
