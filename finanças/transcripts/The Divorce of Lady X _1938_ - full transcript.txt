I'm looking for rooms to the ladies desperately, and I hoped he could help me. - In what sense? - There is some divin in the living room and down there are chairs which are very comfortable. - He wants the room to give way, will not he? - If he were so kind ... I see, let me explain. I've been traveling for two days. The train has been horrendous, I have arrived Two hours late to Victoria Station. I'm exhausted and moody, in fact, angry with fatigue. I am the legal occupant of the suite and I intend to defend it swiftly. Goodnight. If I gave up even the living room, It could accommodate four ladies. No no.

What, sweetie? I do not know. As if I looked at others, what a stupidity. He does not put that, he is more educated. Put "Please do not disturb." - Good... - Well, what? I would like to know that to me. To whom I owe the pleasure of this visit? Why is it? I was looking for something. Whatever it is, I do not think that I found it in my room. I'm exhausted and I'm looking a place to sleep. And this seems the perfect place. I thought so to see her enter in surprise. Of sopet n, no, but silently. And when do you plan to leave? silently? - At 8, after breakfast. - Ah, yes? So, we'll sleep together, will not we? There is a room for each one. But the two beds are here. Ah there's a sof , You can sleep in it. How? I have not seen a woman more shameless, and on top he acts like nothing. If you were more kind, I would insist on leaving. He has not heard what I told the manager? - Something I've heard by chance. - Yes, with so little tact who takes my bed knowing that I need to sleep, that morning and believing I would not resist you. I have a lot of dreams, Can you go? I'm sure he does not mean it. It's too good to kick me out. Well? You do not know me, My problem is that I am weak. A lovely girl like you would cheat me with nothing, but I know what my weakness is, that's why I force myself to be impolite. - Even nasty. - He likes to talk about himself, huh? Yes, men usually do it, but, at least, we know how we are. Women, no. They only know how other women are. On another occasion we will talk about you. Now, if you are tired, go to bed. Good evening! - What did he say? - I said good night. I've already heard it, but I do not know what he intends. He can not come and ... I'm tired, can you go? - He does not mean it. - Yes, sir. I know others like you, believe what they think be able to handle men. Unscrupulous, ruthless, vain, arrogant ... - Do not tell me! - She's married, is not she? Yes. Yes, I know the story. Your unhappy husband will be at home, waiting for your fears they are not justified, and this time they will not be, because I'm of those who do not allow themselves to be duped. I tell you again, can you go? How does he know so much about women? For my work I have to see what hide those deceiving lips. - Is it a dentist? - No! Lawyer, and the next time you see her It will be when your husband divorces. - Divorce? He would never do that. - He will be a very good person. - You've had a grueling trip, have not you? - What I do! It's a shame that the fog the night has annoyed him, but it is the same fog that deprives me to go with my dear husband. If you do not mind, What is it called? Well, I know that I care. Well, I see that it is discreet. You can sleep on the sofa. - It's a charm! - No! And aprate or change your mind. Good evening, Miss X.

Towards me from you - From you to me. - From you to me. Towards me. Look, it will be better let me leave this to me. Come on! This is going to be your bed. Come, for there! With this you have enough. You are lucky to have this. I'm already starting to sulphide. Qu dese ah , d jeme a m . And do not help me, it has been a disaster. Women are all the same, They do not help at all.

Goodnight. Goodnight. And thanks. What's up? - I can not sleep with this disguise. - Well, you better take it off. - And what do I wear? - If it were for me, nothing!

As... - Aguachirri. Try the jam. - Surely it tastes like printing ink. - No thanks. You have to eat something. A hard day's work awaits you. I do not want anything, thank you. And today, you would care Tell me what your name is? Leslie - What Leslie? - How "What Leslie?" It's my given name. Leslie How strange. And yours? - Everard. - What? Everard! - Incredible. - You do not like it either? - I would never get used to it. - Who asks you? Anything else? - Yes, are you always like that in the morning? - Until I smoke the first cigar. Thank you. Thank you. Poor who marries you. I do not intend to marry, Unless you get a divorce. Gods! The time. - What do you think? - On what? - About the divorce. - I will not need your services. - Thank you. - Maybe your unhappy husband, yes. - Unhappy, why? - Because you cheated on him. Absolutely. If I have heard you say that I was a waiter Am I a waiter? What did you do? Prosecutor, you say? Attorney, notary, lawyer. Of a lawyer you learn to judge the character of the people. With a lie like that from the stand, I would know what to think of you. So, You will never trust me anymore. You have a quality that has no price. I'm dying to hear it. You are a sun in the morning. I am unbearable. It's a strange quality for a woman. As a wife, You must be adorable. That is very hasty, we do not even know each other Not much less. We know each other better than many people after years of marriage. There are invisible bonds that unite us! How are we going to separate forever? How could we see each other and act like strangers? How would I say What is said to a stranger? No, we have to see each other again. Where do we stay? The Savoy, the Embassy, the Claridges? To eat, have a snack, have dinner? Today, tomorrow, tonight? Do you do something tonight? Come on come on. S or not? Come, acl rate. S or not? Contact me, woman! Where are you? Sorry. My dear, that is the bug that has been in a bed all night while we were circling on the pool table. What coffee? ADl S, EVERARD He finished with the trays, sir? - Outside. - Very good, sir. I suppose this liquid is described like a brew of coffee beans. I will tell you what it is: �Aguachirri, it tastes like rays! I've been asking for you for 40 years the eggs passed through water. Are these like this? Why not! They are in the same virginal state than when the hens put them. You have been fingering the newspaper, trying to do the crossword I do not read your newspaper, I have my own and know it. On the whole, I know too many things about you. So, I should leave forever. It's just what I wanted to tell you. - Good morning, Miss Leslie. - Good morning. What's up Jeffries? Your Se or a He has dismissed me again. Come on, the cigar is smoking. - Good morning, grandpa. - Leslie, where have you been? Did not Jeffries tell you? - I know I told you. - Thank you. He knows perfectly that last night there was fog and that Miss Leslie spent the night at the Royal Parks Hotel. His parents are in India and I take responsibility for it. - And me. - T ? - I am his grandfather. - And I know her better. It horrifies me to think that my granddaughter leave home at 9 o'clock at night and return at 9 in the morning. There are girls who can not be trusted nor if you send them a letter, but I could send to Miss Leslie at the North Pole. It is not my obligation ask him to account for everything he does? Of everything? You are not a meddlesome judge, but a lovely grandfather. - Grandpa. - S , honey? - Do you know one Logan? - Logan? - Logan Everard, lawyer. - Everard! Wait. - Logan, yes, today comes to my court. - Really? - Cool. What is it, grandpa? - Logan? Ask good questions to witnesses of the opponent, but does not take one. - Why do you ask? - I think he'll marry me. - He has proposed it to you? - Do not. He does not know yet. Well, if he does not know yet, How? Leslie! - What the hell are you wearing? - It's ugly, huh? It's your pajamas. - The one of whom? - Logan's. How do you wear a man's pajamas whose existence you did not know yesterday? - I've slept in your bed. - What? I had two beds, one we took to the living room, and I slept in the other. - Leslie, this is the last straw. - Did not I tell you I was fine? - Does not understand the new generations. - I do not think the others do it. - Grandpa. - Tell me. - He does not know who I am. - Who? Logan! It was believed that she was a woman, and well twisted. - Woman you're not, but twisted less. - But I behaved as if it were. And he saw this nonsense and it was believed that she was married. It is a linnet. It is not! If a youngster and a ring they have cheated him, is that he is a donkey. Jeffries, when you were young, the grandpa never Did he let himself be deceived? Never. And now you are a great judge, as it will be - Logan some day. - Give him time and nobody can cheat him. - How long? 40 50 years. - Have you taken it seriously before? - No, sir. Good Guy. - Good morning, Mr. Logan. - Good morning, Slade. Thanks tom. - Welcome back to London. - Thank you. A charming little village. - Less for time, of course. - What's wrong? - It is the best in the world. - For example, the fog last night. Right, where else? Does a phenomenon happen like that? The most beautiful city submerges in an impenetrable valley of mystery. Life is a fascinating adventure, the fate guides your steps, You can find a miracle. - I see that you found it. - Leave that. Although you are always there miracles, fog or not. And, if you allow it, It's not time to stop going from miracle to miracle? - I'm an acquaintance of yours, it's from my club. - How? Mere, Mere ... - Oh, yes, Lord Mere, what's up? - How are you doing? I see that well. - Do not ask me, it's going to be fatal for me. - What's the problem? What problem? - My wife. - What's the matter with Lady Mere? Well, he has been with a man. Does it seem little? Divorce motivation? For any court, but The correct thing is to go to your solicitor. I know, but I have been told that you dissolves marriages like aspirin, so first of all I want your advice. - I'm involved, explain me the basic ... - I've already done it, it's been ... Yes, yes, I know. - But, does he want it? - What? - Well, yes. - And why do you want a divorce? Give everything, I will not leave that cheat me, there is a limit. I understand you, Lord Mere. He has given his wife his surname, your money and a faithful love, and she returns it with an anguished humiliation. That is, you have hit the nail on the head. I've heard the same story too many times. The caring husband and the woman who cheats him. - What evidence do you have? - Last night he left before dinner and has not returned until 9 in the morning. Suspect, and then there is your maid, who went to the hotel and saw her leave. - What hotel was it? - The Royal Parks. - What? - The Royal Parks. I will have read that yesterday there was a costume dance for charitable purposes, now. Yes, I've heard something. And there is another important factor, he was all night with the disguise. - Can you imagine why I get angry? - No, I have no idea. - Tell me, what's your costume? - I do not think it matters. Yes, if I had been a diver, it would not enter one's eyes. It was not like that. I was beautiful. From French noble of the second empire. The Empress Eugenia, crinolines and all that. - Yes, I see. - Last night the fog was very thick. - I am aware. - I could not accompany her. I went for dinner with friends from my old regiment. Yes, yes. Follow, what happened? - He spent the night there, but not alone. - How do you know? - By Sanders. - Who is it? - Your maid. - How do you know? Because I brought clothes to the hotel. - He had asked for it? - No. Call at 9 to say that he was coming right away, but I sent Sanders and he heard from the hallway of his room I was talking to a man. - And he came in? - No, it's ready and I listened. - And what did you hear? - He saw. He saw her leave around 8:45 and then he saw a man that came out later. - Y? - And what? Does not it seem enough? Sufficient? Has the nerve to accuse his wife of the most serious that can accuse her, And I hope you call the law to a great woman, for some eavesdropping at 8:45, at a party, for being with a boy? - Do you reject my case? - That's not any case and it makes me angry. - If I heard Sanders ... - No, I've had enough. With what he told me, I already have an idea of ​​his wife. A noble, intriguing woman, delivered, pure of heart, of the class that would not do anything that will tarnish the honor of the family. - And my humiliation, what? - In the good and the bad, no? And she promised to love, honor and obey Remember the ceremony, There she was, an innocent girl about to spend the worst moment of his life. Logan, it's rolling, I was not an innocent girl. I was already divorced from one Lauderdale, who trains horses. - Go. - Now you will say "go" again. Before Lauderdale, it had divorced from Brissac's bar, who makes brandy of low graduation. - Is she French? - U.S. To her first husband, they called him the Wild Kavanagh, a professional wrestler, He got rid of him in Reno. It seems impossible. Four marriages and so young. - Who said he was young? - You, is not it? Well, it seems and it coaxes you, but it is a bug, Logan, a v bora, that hypnotizes innocent men and then it stings. Or I get rid of her or I will seek ruin. - Now I begin to understand him. - Well, then will you take my case? Well, I'll think about it. It's all I can tell you. I already told him that I'm very involved. Then I call him, I'm very involved. - Good morning. - Yes. Good morning A horse trainer, a brandy merchant and a fighter. - What's the matter? - Do you know that man? Yes, Lord Mere. It is very well known. - The best there is in the army. - Really? - Well, that costume is his wife's. - What? Was Lady Mere the miracle? - Do not whistle. - He has gotten into a good one. How will you accuse someone in a trial for something you do? Look, Slade, that's the worst of all. I did not do anything. And if a defendant accused of adultery Tell him that? - But it's true! I swear to you! - Nothing happened! None of anything! Yes, swear, but Mr. Logan, I hope you believe me What did not happen? Secure! Ms. Johnson, Do you expect me to believe that nothing happened? Well, that is... See ... Well, nothing relevant, If you know what I want to say. Yes, of course, I mean what you want to say. And surely His Lord also. I'm afraid I prefer an explanation. Any explanation, Ms. Johnson? Can you explain it to His Lord? We have had many chances to see what women want to say, or what they mean they say, if what they say wants to say something. Order in the room. There is a very simple explanation: Mrs. Johnson is a woman. And I will not remind you, Your Lord, that women have their religion. The immemorial creed of femininity. It only contains a dogma of faith, but all women believe in him. They believe they are the biggest advance of the human species, a being that has evolved to be above all criticism, of all reproach and outside the law. To men, with their bonhom a, they have been tricked into accepting them as a rational being and have allowed their emancipation. What is your reward? Women do not know femininity, they reject the obligations of man. She demands freedom, but he shuns responsibilities. It says to want time to develop as a person and use it deciding which part of the Body will be the next one to be painted. For independence, understands laziness, for equality, understand not stop as Catherine the Great. - Do not stop as who? - Catherine the Great, Your Lord. Do not stop like Catherine the Great, eh? Thank you. The union with a man means that wait for her with open arms! A current woman does not understand of loyalty, decency or justice! It does not oppose, nor does it resist, nor is it self-controlled! It is not affective, loving or compassionate! In short: unscrupulous, ruthless and demanding, lazy and tedious, bland, boring and vain, vengeful, unworthy and weak. When the man removes the whip, will return the progress. That is the explanation of the lady and the case. You can leave now. Saunders, do not fear for Logan. They just have to answer you honestly. Already, but, what to think from m Lady Mere? Think what you think, nothing will happen to you. Lord Mere is here with his solicitor and the witness, the maiden. - You can not see me, I was in the hotel! - If you have to catch it now. Logan, I already heard him. Haulfryer, my solicitor. They know each other, no? - Good morning. - And this is Saunders. - Enchanted, please sit down. - If you have doubts, they will clarify them. - Saunders, you saw the man, did not you? - Yes, sir. - And I had not seen it before? - I'm not sure, sir. - Are not you sure? Did not he see it well? - He was not wearing his glasses. - Then, would not you recognize it? - I have not said that. I did not say that I would not recognize it, but I did not recognize it. She is a very intelligent girl. Saunders, tell him what you saw. - Describe the man. - Lord, I do not know if I could. - Try it. - Well, I do not know what to say. - He was a normal man. - Describe it with details, woman! Do not be impatient, give it a opportunity, do not be afraid Tell Mr. Logan how he was. High or low? It was ... of a normal height. - Was he brown, blond or red? - It was something in between. - Was she young, older? - It was something ... - Between. - Between, that's it. - Was I shaved? - Good... Did he have a beard? No, sir, I'm sure of that. But he may have a mustache. - Ah! I had a mustache. - No, I did not have it. - Are you sure you have not seen it? - Yes, quite sure. - What's the matter, Slade? - The lady is here. - What is it? - The lady of the case. The woman in the case ... Excuse me. Why? - Why did you come? - To return this, your pajamas. Thank you. Anything else? What happened to you? You're not as caring as in that breakfast. Well, I'll tell you. Your husband is there. Who? I understand that you are so confused, after all your husbands. This is not even horses, nor that of brandy, nor the fighter, but the last one: Lord Mere. - Lord Mere? - Yes. And who told you who was my husband? He told me everything. And you will be as upset as I am when you know everything you know. Know about the hotel and the disguise. - But, what do you want from you? - Divorce, divorce! Lord Mere wants to divorce, interesting. - Yes, right? - And you'll help him, I hope. QueTo divorce you being the alleged culprit? I understand that you are so cruel with all your experience. But you know that will ruin me! Already I imagine it what Lord Steele will say. - Lord Steele? - Yes, he's the worst judge of all. He will rejoice in my misfortune. But if Lord Mere gets what he wants, he will be free. You and I could, let's say, get together. - Would you like it, would not you? - At the expense of my career? You have it very cre do. I'm sorry, I thought I had started to like you. I could not stop you from liking me despite how unpleasant you were. But I guess that I only have left take my medicine and leave. I understand clearly how you caught all those men. - What men? - Lauderdale, the bar of Brissac, The Wild One ... - They were those? - Yes, those. Then, poor Lord Mere. And now me. T ? Yes, I should not admit it. I love you Even now that I know the ruthless truth. I'm crazy about you. I want to take you in my arms. And why do not you do it? I do not know. - What am I doing here kissing you? - And you do it very well! Your husband is there, and your solicitor and Saunders, who saw us both. Wait! Think, Saunders, think. Do not be silly. - Sir, but if I'm thinking ... - Sit down, let's see what happens to me. Where did we go? Oh, yes, by the man from Royal Parks. He says he would not recognize his face? No, sir, but I think that he would recognize his gait. Yes, but ... - Have not you seen it before or after? - Do not. But I have met all men since the first divorce in Reno. Saunders has been faithful to my wife since his first marriage, no? - Yes, sir, five years. - Five years? A whole record. Well, after Reno He married Brissac's bar. No, after Mr. Kavanagh It was Mr. Miller. - Mr. Miller? - Not official... Not official. An innocent friendship? Good... - It does not take much detail. - I'm sorry, Mr. Mere. If you want me to take the case I have to know all the details. Only bad things happen if you hide it things to the doctor or the lawyer. Exact. - Yes. And after Mr. Miller? - Mr. Vanheuten. - Not official. - Not official. And after Mr. Vanheuten? - Barissa de Brissac. - How long before the divorce? - 14 months - And after the Baron de Brissac? - Mr. Miller. - That was after Mr. Kavanagh. No. That was Mr. Miller I and this is Mr. Miller II. - Is there a Mr. Miller III? - Only Mr. Mendoza, from Argentina, then Mr. Lauderdale and then His Lord. Little thing, huh? - Do you have everything you want? - Yes. - Are you going to take my case? - Yes, sir. My friend Haulfryer will prepare it for me and I will get you a divorce. Well, come on, come on. I will not be worried about not knowing Who is the man from the Royal Parks? I know who is the hotel man. - What? - That is, I know how it should be. After Mr. Miller I, of Mr. Miller II and Mr. Mendoza, It seems the fourth fool, good afternoon. - Where are you? - The miracle? It is gone. He has sprinkled an exquisite perfume in the pajamas. - Go! - Anything else? - But do not ask me to do one thing. - What? - That he thinks nothing happened ... I have decided to take the case. - Have you decided to cause a scandal? - Yes. - To ruin you? - Yes.

A tender and delicate being placed in the world to give it clarity and happiness to life with its beauty and tenderness. And I say it for its purity. Your Lordship, that was found in the bathroom with two of her lovers, it's a lack of discretion for its part. But against it is his affirmation that nothing happened!

In my opinion, Ms. Strangeways He is guilty of only one thing. She is guilty of being a woman. That is the explanation from Mrs. Logan ... Mrs. Strangeways and the explanation of the present case, You can go.
