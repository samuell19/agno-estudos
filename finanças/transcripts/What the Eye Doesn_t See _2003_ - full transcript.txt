- How much? Here are ten. - You tell me. No. Fifteen or twenty. - Fifteen. Ten plus five, fifteen. - Fifteen thousand dollars. The scoundrel sold out for fifteen thousand dollars. Who is that Kouri guy? An opposition congressman who joined Fujimori's party as soon as he was elected. He said he could serve his people better that way. The only thing he was serving was his pocket! You can see there how he was bought. Where did that video come from? We have congresswoman Marta Chávez on the line. Good evening. What do you think of the video released by the opposition? I think that the video will have be analyzed by experts. I'm not saying it's false, but I do know that with technology one can... Does she think that we're idiots, that we'll swallow that story? No, sir. It's over. This is the end of Fujimori and Montesinos. Nonsense. He'll put Montesinos in jail and that's that. Like nothing happened. - If the king falls, so does the page. - No, sir. Fujimori won't fall. And Fujimori is no one's page. ...received that money in order to enter the governing party. The dictatorship's days are numbered. Fujimori will be gone in a month, I'm telling you. - Want to bet? - Do you like losing? All right. Let's bet. Look at how the people love him. ...today President Fujimori opened a school in Huancavelica, accompanied by prime minister Federico Salas. The school, equipped with one hundred computers, can accommodate over two hundred students. WHAT THE EYE DOESN'T SEE We interrupt our program to transmit an address to the nation from President Fujimori. Fellow countrymen, this week, by means of a video, a grave accusation has been made. My position in this matter is clear and firm. I will support a thorough investigation to discover the people who are legally responsible. I want to point out that this is, above all, a political incident that has obviously had a strong impact on the stability of my government and of the country. It is my moral obligation, as president of the republic, to make a decision in this situation. Despite having been elected by a majority, I do not wish to become a factor of disturbance. For that reason, I have decided to deactivate the National Intelligence Service. Secondly, I will call general elections. I hope this second measure will be accepted and understood in its true context by the competent organizations. I will not take part in these general elections, but rather those who feel capable of carrying out the presidential and congressional functions. The people, I am sure, will wisely choose the best future for them. As you have just heard, the president has called new elections barely two months after taking over the government. This is an act that deserves our utmost respect. So now we're supposed to thank him. And what about Montesinos? That's what I want to know. What'll happen to that criminal? I know nothing about it, but there's something behind it. And cheer up, Victor. You won the bet. Listen, that's Toledo. Do they think he'll just leave? This is only a scheme to weather the storm. He's bound to have a plan. It isn't easy to get rid of Montesinos. Remember, that guy controls the armed forces. Does that mean you won't pay the bet? I knew you supported Fujimori. I'll pay when Fujimori swears in the new president. But since I'll die before that, I'll put it in my will. How much longer does he have, doctor? Six months to one year. That's what the doctor told me. Fujimori's regime will die before you do, or my name isn't Victor Alcántara. We'll see. What are you so happy about? Did the people lynch Fujimori and his corrupt partner? That's all you think about. Look! I knew it. Didn't I tell you, Victor? Now that they've lent her the instrument, the girl can practice. When is the concert? God grant I'll be fit enough to go and listen to you. Of course you'll be fit. So will you, Mr. Lucho. Your oatmeal. You want me to eat this mush? I'm starving, Mercedes. Go and buy a couple of those triple sandwiches I like. If you want to go to her concert, start by obeying the doctor. May I, Mr. Lucho? Fujimori is speaking. What will become of him now? We must defend everyone's human rights so naturally he is also entitled to that protection because he is targeted along with the president of the Republic... Now what do you say? He's defending a criminal as if he were a hero, a patriot. What kind of person is your president if he thanks that crook for his services to the nation? He's being blackmailed. That's what it is. He gave him too much power and these are the consequences. But he'll find a way out of it. Don't you think so? You're fighting over nothing. It doesn't matter who's in power. Right. I think exactly the same. Beginning in 1945 with Bustamante who governed with the APRA. Then Velasco did the same thing. And just now, Alan Garcia. Don't listen to that enemy of the people. They didn't rob you, they changed your measly dollars for soles, like it should be. They were worthless. Just pieces of paper. I worked like a dog and ended up living on a miserable pension, because even that money was stolen by all the governments. My name is Addison De Witt. You could say I live in the theater, although I'm not an actor. I am a critic. Wife of a theater actor... You think you're a movie star, don't you? - Breakfast is ready. - Thanks, Eva. I'm coming now. If your milk gets cold, it's your problem. Eva... - What are you doing tonight? - None of your business. My name is Rodolfo López and this woman is madly in love with me, but she likes to play games. Don't believe everything she says. "If your milk gets cold, it's your problem." In her language that means she wants to have breakfast with me, that she needs me to cheer up her breakfast with her consumptive brother and her worried mother. "None of your business" means "Thank you for paying attention to me". Eva, Eva, the golden girl, on magazine covers, the girl next door, or the one on the moon. Gonzalo is the greatest, isn't he, mom? I love him. The now ex-adviser was exiled to Panama after submitting his resignation. Didn't I tell you this would happen? Fujimori is a sly one. It looked as if he was defending him, but all the while he was working on getting rid of him. Montesinos should be in jail, not in exile. What about his promise of a thorough investigation? Who could understand you? You wanted Montesinos gone. Now he's gone and you aren't happy. Everyone whines here. That's our country's problem. It doesn't progress because we're governed by thieves, that's why. Can I have a piece? Is it coconut? Only if you accept that he'll stay in office at least 5 more years. Thieves! Of course there are thieves, you'll find them in every government, but at least Fujimori controlled inflation and beat terrorism. Do you still want some? The opposition parties will undoubtedly concentrate on the upcoming elections and their demands for the democratization and moralization of the armed forces as well as the revision of the trials against soldiers accused of crimes against human rights. - I'm leaving. - Did you know this would happen? No. And what about your promotion? Montesinos was in charge of that. Now that he's not here, what will happen? As you will remember, the amnesty decreed in 1995 meant that they weren't convicted for their participation in the "Colina Group". Montesino's interference in the Justice Department is another matter that must be investigated. Did you hear? The pretty boy turned on us too. He's talking bullshit. - Come with me, Chauca. - What's wrong? The colonel will have to help us out. Revoredo? He'll say he knew nothing, he just signed and paid. That bastard always kept his hands clean. Who are you calling? Are you the wife of that communist shit Polanco? Let's make an inventory. Is the photographer ready? All this is my son's! Calm down, ma'am. It's his! My son is dead! Those wretches killed him. They called again, they said they'd kill us, that we don't know what they're capable of. Calm down, Helena. Those are empty threats, they're more scared than we are. They threatened me. They said if you keep digging up the graves, - they'll... - They won't dare do anything. They're cowards. They can't scare me, so they're going after you. - Are you listening to me? - Yes. Believe me, Helena, things are starting to change. They've lost control of at least part of the press and they know they can't expose themselves. Understand? Perfectly. Nothing will happen. All's well. Better than we expected. What seemed a rumor a few hours ago has just been confirmed. After less than 30 days in exile, Vladimiro Montesinos returned to Lima with the government's approval. We have been told the plane landed a few hours ago at Pisco airbase. Montesinos and his closest collaborators may take advantage of the amnesty law approved by Fujimori's government and which allowed military personnel and civilians who were accused of... What do you say now, idiot? Damn it, all the faggot traitors are shitting themselves. Montesinos will put everyone in their place. - Let's go for a beer. - Yeah. - You got money? - Yeah. You finish that. What's happening? It's open war. Why is he chasing Montesinos? They've always been in contact. Fujimori himself allowed Montesinos' plane to land. They say he's after the videos that compromise him and his loyal congressmen and ministers. Of course we can't say that. - Whose side are you on? - Give me a break. What do you think we've been eating all these years? You know very well, Gonzalo, so don't act surprised now. We'll give the news objectively, without being too sore on the government, know what I mean? We'll see where that takes us. Slow and steady, that's the way. How can you be pleased that that gangster is back, Chauca? I told you that I don't want you smoking here. I'm sorry, I didn't know... I have to go. Look at my face. And my hair is terrible. Didn't you see the hairdresser? Fujimori has declared Montesinos a fugitive of justice. He's visiting all military installations and arresting officers connected to Montesinos. You have to go on the air right now. The police operation set up to capture Montesinos was like something from a movie, but it failed. The whereabouts of Vladimiro Montesinos remain unknown. When I get home I'll tell you to undress and fix a Martini, like the ones you fix for me, "shaken not stirred". And the sentence from the other trial? You'll have to wait a few days. The D.A. wants the case revised. They should both go free tomorrow, or the day after at the latest. And who is the D.A.? Someone who wants attention. The same one who authorized that the mass graves be dug up by those communist human rights people. But don't worry, I can handle it. I'll give you some now and the rest when the final sentence is given. Give me all of it. That D.A. is expensive. And Montesinos' people want their cut. There are no hidden cameras here yet, are there? Don't be wicked. Come in. Excuse me, your coffee. Miss Pilar sent this. Should I put it on? A journalist has evidence that agents from the National Intelligence Service infiltrated the march, so they could cause trouble. Thank you, Rodolfo. Are you interested? The fire at the National Bank was part of a secret plan carried by National Intelligence Service agents in order to provoke death and destruction. But we have clues as to... You won't process this accusation, will you? Those two are intelligence agents who pretended to be marchers. They definitely went too far. And they also hired common criminals... Don't mess with his people. That's friendly advice. I've taken precautions. - What did you say? - I swear I'm innocent. They paid me to go on Toledo's march against the government. Mercedes, come on! They're taking your dad! But why? Who's taking him? What has he done? Dad! What's happening? Where are they taking you? Mr. Arturo Peñaflor. He'll help you get me out, he's a lawyer! Don't forget! Good morning. Is this Mr. Peñaflor's office? Yes, it is. I must see him. It's urgent. - Do you have an appointment? - No, but I have a message from my dad. Is he in? No, come back tomorrow, but I don't know if he'll see you. He's a very busy person. Now do you like me, teacher? Or will I just say "teach". Don't speak. Don't do anything. How are you, Mr. Lucho? Don't talk to that traitor. You said you'd come after rehearsal. Has something happened? Is your scoundrel of a father in trouble again? No, everything's fine. The armed forces are standing down. Montesinos is on his own. Is it true? Have they retired you? They said your name on TV. Why? What did you do? It's one thing not promoting you, but forcing you to retire? What did they say to you? It seems the Justice Department is also changing. This morning our reporters were allowed into the work area of a group of specialists led by forensic anthropologist Antonio Polanco. We began this work a few weeks ago, but very discreetly, to avoid any reprisals. I want to praise the courage of the D.A. who, despite pressure and threats, allowed the exhumation. How many bodies have been found? We reckon that there are about 20 people buried here. Will this reveal the culprits? Our work is to gather evidence which will identify both victims and culprits, who, as we know, acted under a promise of impunity. That communist talks as if he didn't know Montesinos was back. We can calculate the distance at which they were shot, whether they were tortured... This war is just starting. Let's go. What? Where? Do I have to spell it out for you? I can't. I've got things to do. What do you have to do? Don't be a faggot. No insults. I have to see a client about a job. You know how times are. Work is scarce. This guy saw my work and he was impressed. He says he's working on a huge ad campaign and... Angélica has you by the balls. Me? Why? Don't pretend. I know where you're going. A "client". Relieve me at midnight. You know where. Or I'll come looking for you. We can't let fear stop us, and when the time comes we'll give the D.A. all the evidence that identifies those guilty of these crimes. We'll be interested in seeing that report once the team has finished its work. We're going over to the presidential palace where a press conference is under way. We have found bank accounts in a holding, amounting to $5,317,000... Leave it. I want to rest a while. - Can I go? - Yes. Damn, I thought it was Angélica. - You fantasize about the make-up girl? - Don't be an idiot. Right. You only like pretty young girls like me. - Have you finished? - Yes. I've only got one scene left. Will you wait for me? I'm tired. Why not come by my apartment when you're done? It's just one scene. Can't you wait? It'll only be ten minutes. Only ten. Any more and I'm leaving. You're a real shit. Meet me at the set. The "Colina group", who executed 9 students and a professor from La Cantuta University in July '92 - was tried and sentenced... - Were you there? Were you one of the "Colina Group"? But an amnesty law passed by congress in July 1995 allowed Martin Rivas and his companions... Swear you weren't retired because of that. Swear on your children's lives. Don't you have a watch? I've been waiting for hours. Now we'll be late. - Where were you? - Working. In the shop? A new order? No, it's security stuff. But, please, don't ask. We've just missed the bus. We'll have to wait another half hour. Gonzalo! Why didn't you wait for me? That bastard has an easy life. Always in cahoots with the government, making all the money he wants, and he's got a girl who's a knockout. Shut up, idiot. I want to get a good table and the place will be full. And I want to eat something. I've been working all day. And where does the TV guy eat? I'm not going to that dinner or to the disco. I told you I was tired. I'm sick of your actor friends. You go, if you want. No problem. No, of course there's no problem. Nothing I do interests you. I don't know why I'm with you. Why don't we have dinner at my place and watch a movie? On our own. I'm really tired. I want to go dancing. I love that disco. Eva, the golden haired girl welcomes me with her beautiful dance. Her eyes look for mine and she leaves me in ecstasy. How can I say no, how can I say no to her smallest whim? I'm a hard man, but this woman has managed to get to me. Dance my dear. Dance. What elegance, what harmony! Beauty among beauties! Mom! What can I do? Leave the job? Walk out on the people who have helped me? - Is that what you want? - That's your decision, Antonio. I can't ask you to quit. It's not that. I'm not a martyr, and I don't want you to be one. They're criminals who know they've failed. You're on edge, and that's normal in your condition. Want me to come back for a few days? Maybe I could get away for a while. I don't know. If you're scared and you need me... Don't treat me like I was a child. All right. What do you want me to do? I think it's best to wait for a while until we both want to see each other. Let go! Let go of me! Eva, Eva, don't ask for the moon. We have the stars. Why did you sleep here? You pay for a room. Why are you looking at me? I stayed in case there was an emergency. Who else could help you? You, your mother and your brother need me. What we need is a doctor and lots of money. Money. Not some deadbeat who's broke, like you. It's just a step from hate to love, baby. When will you accept that you're crazy about me? Good morning. He fell asleep. He doesn't have a fever. I just took his temperature. Then I'll let him rest. It's the infection, right? The doctor says if he doesn't improve they'll have to amputate his leg. He'll decide later today. I have to go. When he wakens, tell him I've gone to rehearsal. - All right. - Thank you. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Did you hear the news? First we have to see what's in the videos. No, that's old news! Didn't you hear about Montesinos' millionaire accounts? 3 accounts in 3 Swiss banks amounting to $48 million. 48 millions! I'd be satisfied with one, with a half, with a quarter million! 48 million! How can you spend that much? You buy a private jet, a Caribbean island, expensive women. Then you need to steal some more. Spending money is easy. What makes me mad is the way he stole from the poor. Because that bastard stole from us, he stole the poor people's money! I'd sentence that son of a bitch to death. Fujimori will get him. You heard him. Yeah, right. Like Fujimori knew nothing. You know why? Because they were accomplices, that's why! I see you're arguing, Victor. That's a good sign. It's the outrage that makes me forget about this leg, doctor. Of course you don't remember about all that Alan Garcia stole. Let's see. - Does that hurt? - Yes, doctor. Are there any relatives, besides his granddaughter, we can speak to? Just a useless son-in-law, so if you've got bad news, you can give it to me. Helena. Helena, are you there? Did you mean what you said? But it's all right. I respect your decision. Take care of yourself. What's wrong? Where are you going? Why are you dressed like that? Hey! How dare he annul the releases you ordered? I won't stand for this. There is a lady here, sir. Mercedes Lobatón. She wants to see you. Her father is in jail and he said you could help. I'm not in for anyone. They've appointed anti-vice judges to view the videos and I've applied to assist them. They'll need a lot of people, for all those videos. Look! There they are! There are loads of them. Over 800. They all have to be numbered and transcribed. There's going to be a special screening room for all the work. Do you think they'd take me? You? I'm the right man for this job. Of course I am. "I am the man." Bring me a pastry and coffee. Here's the money. Excuse me. Leave it there, please. What's wrong with this piece of shit? You have to press the middle button. Let's see. Damn! A member of the Supreme Court! This is heavy stuff. And I mean really heavy. Write it down: Montesinos with Beltrán. - Me? - Write it down! Listen to me, I'm telling you. Your luck has changed. "I am the man." You hair looks great. New conditioner? You look well rested. I'm like a new man. I only ate a salad and I slept very well. I wish I had your willpower. I slept terribly, I stuffed myself on chicken, French fries, mayonnaise... - What is it? - You have a mark or something here. I don't know... You're wasting your time. I told you he won't see you. I have to give him my father's message. He has to come out some time. I'll tell him then. He's very busy and has a lot of important clients... What's wrong, Susy? - Who is this young lady? - I'm sorry sir, I told her... - Are you Mr. Peñaflor? - Yes. How can I help you? Are you Lobatón's daughter? Come with me. What's happened to your father? I have to go. Why not come with me and tell me about it on the way? Come along, then. Let me help you. What happened? An accident. But this is no time for questions. - Her name and age? - I don't know. Check and see if she's got any ID. I only brought her in. She's in your hands now, doctor. I'm sorry, but you can't go. Even generals have to report accidents. Please wait outside while I examine her. But you can hardly see it. I bet it's from your Caribbean trip. You didn't use enough sun block. - You're on in ten. Are you ready? - No, I'm not! I've got no idea what the show is about. They're trying to get the D.A. "Trying"? We're on in ten minutes and they're trying? I know what you mean. It's chaos. But you have the congress issues. What's going on in congress? No one tells me anything! What the hell do they think I am? Some stupid newsreader? I've been here for an hour and... All I know is I have to tell you you're on in ten minutes. - I'm not your producer. - Don't give me all that shit! What are you waiting for? I'm sick of the show, the station and all the political bullshit! How old are you? Sixteen. Sixteen. My dad only managed to tell me to look for you. I don't even know where they took him. He's innocent. My father isn't a thief or a criminal. He's done nothing wrong. It must be a mistake. You know him, don't you? He's worked for you, and I know you're a lawyer. Tell me, Mercedes, why are you seeing to all this? Don't you have a mother or older brothers and sisters? Just grandpa, but he's sick. The opposition voted to dismiss the president of congress, Fujimori's last stronghold. With this decision, congress has begun to regain the credibility it lost after many years of submissive obedience. He just goes with the flow. He used to be full of praise for the government. But now that things are rough, just look at him. We have to look on the bright side, Victor. What can we do? We were born screwed and we'll die screwed. At least you have a granddaughter who loves you. But I... I don't even have a dog and I'll die before you do. I thought she'd go jogging and come back, so I waited at the lookout post for over two hours. I think she's looking for her husband to ask him to stop the dig, because we really scared her! I mean, we were outside her house all night. So I think the mission is a success and our enemies have abandoned their objective. You moron. We'll keep watching that slut's house. I'm putting you in charge of that operation. Me? All on my own? A moron, like you said? And what for? There's nobody there. When a ship sinks, the rats leave. Rats come back. I'll ask for reinforcements. Meanwhile, you're in charge. Understood? You're scared, right? I know what you're thinking. You were just a driver. You could tell about what we did and use that new amnesty and betray me like a lousy informer. What's wrong with you? You're insulting me. I'd never rat on my people. You know me. Chauca, I don't like to give orders twice. Success attracts women. That girl likes me. She's looking at me so blatantly. She can't take her eyes off me. You're lucky my girlfriend isn't with me, doll. She'd tear your eyes out for flirting with her man. You're a cutie, but I'm taken. Don't hate me for it. You were too late, that's all. Do you work here? Well, yes, I... Some policemen took my dad and I don't know where he is. Maybe he's at the station, or he may be here. His name is Carlos Lobatón. I don't know. There are a lot of people locked up here. Let's go! What did they tell you? Is my dad here? Let's go! - Do you know that boy? - No. Then why did you speak to him? Don't you know that a nice girl doesn't speak to strangers? Or are you not a nice girl? I just asked if he knew anything about my dad. I'm sorry. It's none of my business who you speak to. I've just had an argument and I lost my head. Forgive me. Was it about my dad? What's happening to him? Nothing. Tomorrow I'll ask the judge to release him. I promise he'll be out in a few days. Thank you. Dad was right to trust you. I don't know how to thank you. Don't worry. Call my office so I can keep you informed. What happened, colonel? A car accident? I'm sorry, sir, but I must take your statement and inform you that should the victim die, you will be held until the matter has been fully investigated. Identify yourself. Sgt. Pablo Canchaya. You will take no further action until I order you to do so. Is that clear, Canchaya? You must buy this medicine. - How is she? - A little better, sir. Once she's in the recovery room you can see her. I'll let you know. I don't love you. I lied. I love someone else. It's better like this. He'll forget me and fall in love with the right person. Cut! We've got it. Very good, Maria Paz! What did you think? I really cried. - That love is impossible... - The more tears the better, right? Let's go. I have to change, I won't be long. Of course I want to marry you, what do you think? But the thing is... I've been assigned to... What? I shouldn't say. It's confidential. All right. - I'm in charge of an operation. - You? Yes. You've been retired for ages! What operation? It's another lie. No, it isn't. I'm telling the truth. Will you get paid? I'm not in it for the money. I'm serious, don't laugh. I'm serving my country. But if all goes well, I'll be acknowledged, reinstated, and maybe even promoted. And then we'll get married, with all the trimmings. Me in my dress uniform, and you, dressed in white, beautiful, coming into the church. I'll tell you something. I'm crazy, crazy for you. I need you so much. Hello! We've been rehearsing all day, that's why I couldn't come earlier. Did the doctor see you? What's wrong, grandpa? Bad news, Mercedes. The doctor said the leg isn't so good. They'll run some more tests, but I should get used to the idea that they'll have to cut off his leg. You can come in. This is the lady. Ma'am? Can you hear me? Let me introduce myself. I am Colonel Revoredo. Do you remember what happened? You were running along the road without looking. You practically threw yourself on my car. I helped you for humanitarian reasons. Your family should be told that you're here. Are you intending to accuse me? Ma'am. Can you hear me? What's wrong, doctor? Is she in a coma? There was severe internal bleeding so we operated. She's stable now and she'll recover soon. You can rest easy, general. - Colonel. - Sorry, colonel. But we couldn't save the baby. And, obviously, she's very upset about that. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Can I do anything for you? I want to die. That's all I want. Do you know what it's like to want to die? Given that the president has resigned while out of the country, and that this took place amidst serious doubts about his return, we can only express our indignation and resign our posts as ministers... Have you got nothing to say? You should be jumping for joy while you've still got two legs. I'm not happy he ran away. I want him tried and put in jail. I want him condemned as a thief. What will happen now? Who'll be president? Who? Alan is coming back! Now that the tyrant is gone, Alan will come back to Peru. Long live APRA! One corrupt government is over and you want another scoundrel for president? I won't allow that. Take back what you said. Don't listen to him, grandpa. And don't provoke him. I won't take it back. Alan Garcia ran away too. He went to Paris, just like Fujimori went to Japan. I've always said it. They're all thieves and traitors. Alan left because he was being persecuted by the dictatorship. But now he'll come back and fix things. So he can keep stealing and... Here. See what you can do with this money. Does this hurt? The liver is slightly inflamed. We'll give you some cortisone. And order further blood tests. You'll soon be released. Have you contacted your relatives? Doctor, excuse me. I'm Mr. Alcántara's granddaughter. I was told you would operate on him. - I wanted to know when. - The sooner, the better. But we don't have much money. I only have... Ask Social Services to register him as a needy patient. I brought you some things I thought you might need. Sgt. Canchaya tells me you wouldn't sign your statement. Could you tell me why? Are you going to accuse me? I mean, are you intending to present charges against me? So why didn't you sign? I really want to get this sorted out. But you're not helping me. What do you want? I understand, but... I understand that you're upset. I don't care about any statement. You're in the army, aren't you? Settle things your way. I don't care. You called me? You can photograph this. Did you finish with the rest? The negatives are in the bag. What are your plans? Will you just turn in the report and come back? That's what I should do, we've got so much work. But I want to make up with Helena. Is she expecting you? Let's go. Wait. I haven't finished. Chauca. I need you to get a car for tonight. What for? Intelligence reports say that our target will be here soon. That's all I can say, I'll take over here. With what money can I rent a car? We have to find the means ourselves, for now. But it will soon be like the old days. We're not alone in this, Chauca. We aren't? Fujimori's doing his own thing, Montesinos is on the run. We're on our own. They've dumped us. We've got no influence or money to leave the country. You're crazy, and now you want me to steal a car. - Are you mad? - Jupiter is in charge. He's fed up with the army and he's putting his foot down. He's looking for people he can trust. I repeat: Jupiter has ordered this operation. Does he know I'm in charge? Of course. And when we win he'll make it up to you. Ask him for whatever you want. He knows how to repay a favor. Here. Keep it on, even when you're screwing Angélica. Once you have the car, await my orders. Understood? The anti-vice judges are viewing the videos that will allegedly expose a corruption network set up by Montesinos to control the country. Over 800 videos were recorded secretly by the ex-adviser in order to extort those people who received government favors. What's that on his face? Cut, cut! Will be classified by the judges and then given to congress. Why the hell did you cut? You said six minutes and Montesinos's escape was scheduled. You have a spot on your face. It might be ink. This shit is showing more. Use more make-up. Do something! Why don't you see the doctor? When? I practically live in the station. I don't know why men are such sissies. It won't even hurt. He'll do it in a minute. It takes me longer to put make-up on it. I know, I had a wart removed once. Is he ready? Was it ink? Carry on with the videos and how we must be careful when showing them. And don't mention the names of any of the people in them. And then mention the escape. Rumors say he's in Venezuela. Good heavens! Congressmen, TV station owners, businessmen, the military... They all received money. Montesinos had the whole country in his hands. This is a fucking time bomb. Why did I have to get stuck with this? Could I have a minute, your honor? I'm sorry, I'm busy right now, sir. I know you've never liked me, but allow me to tell you to be very careful... with the material you have. Montesinos is watching how you people handle this. Montesinos? Montesinos left the country, he's on the run from justice. Are you threatening me in his name? Don't get the wrong idea. You know very well... that many of your own colleagues are involved in this. Will you betray them? Your only friends are here, not outside. What's more, Montesinos will appreciate your loyalty. Is that all, Mr. Peñaflor? I'm very busy. Good afternoon. Things are looking very bad. I don't know what videos they'll show to congress. He won't cooperate. Where the hell is he? In Venezuela? Call him then. OK? Lousy traitor! You fucking piece of shit, report me! Helena is in the bathroom. She won't be long. Leave me alone. I can do it myself. - What are you doing here? - I brought your medicine. Thank you. And some magazines. I hope you like them. All women like them. I guess. I want to sleep. I'm tired. Open the fucking trunk! Open it, for crissake! Start it up! Start it up, asshole! Shit, hurry up! What have you done? Are you crazy? I know what I'm doing. What are you waiting for? Hurry up, moron! Stop wasting time! - Where are we going? - Just drive. Shit! You should have parked on the other side. Hurry up! Hurry up! You know why he was here? He came to report us and to fucking testify. This is the goddamn report he was going to hand in. Do you have her phone number? It's getting late, sir. The warden told me to be on time. Cancel the visit. You are too good, sir. You take on a client who has no money and even arrange for the girl to see the father. With all the work you have. What do you expect? Those people are like that. Do you want me to see the inmate and file for his release? No. Don't do a thing. Isn't that judge Rendón? I heard he is giving congress the first batch of videos. How long will this last? I never even spoke to Montesinos and I'm scared. How must the people who were in that room feel? Today, that dream has come true. Members of the jury, ladies and gentlemen, For her distinguished theater performance, the Sara Siddons trophy goes to Eve. As is known, after the events leaving to ex-president Fujimori's flight, congress appointed Mr. Valentín Paniagua who has just received the presidential sash and will govern until July 28. The new president was approved by all the opposition groups and his main task will be to call new elections which must be transparent. We have with us former congressman Santiago Pedraglia who was one of the first to accuse the so-called "Colina Group". Let me hear, boss. What President Paniagua should do is appoint a Commission of Truth and give it full independence and he must allow the investigation of all accusations... That's those left wing bastards. Investigations. What good will that do? Why don't they look ahead... and get the country out of this crisis? We'll have a lot of work. You know how many candidates there are? And what about all of Fujimori's party? Don't know. Why don't you go out for a while? You've been waiting here for days for Pareja. I bet he's in the casino. Go see him so you can get that off your mind. Who says I'm waiting for Pareja? I don't go out because I just don't feel like it. That's not what Miss Angélica thinks. She was mad at Pareja the other day. She said that because of him you're... forgive me, acting like a damned fool. More respect, Orlando. Pardon me. Mom! Don't do that, Cristobal. Do you know the sacrifices I make to feed you? And aren't you ashamed... of eating your sick brother's food? I need 20 soles. I'm broke. There's a concert tonight! There'll be others. Please, mom. It's only 20 soles. Need help, baby? Dare to ask me, sweetheart. Don't look at me like that. I'll be back with great news, baby. I'll ring the bell four times. Long, short, long, short, so you know it's me. No need to see me out. I know the way. Of the 1,500 videos taped by Montesinos, those shown in public session in congress today will be those numbered as 256 and their titles are as follows.. Montesinos with top press executives, high ranking officers, the president of the electoral jury. He'll need this for after the operation. - For today? - Yes. Try to get it and tell me if there is a problem. I'll go with your grandfather. Mercedes. Mr. Peñaflor. Is that your grandfather? Is he very bad? He's diabetic. They're amputating his leg. It's gangrenous. Did the guard tell you I was here? Have you the prescription? We'll buy everything. Where is the drugstore? This way? How do you feel? Like a lamb going to the slaughter. Good morning, ma'am. - How did you sleep? - The wound has closed perfectly. The chest and pelvic X-rays are normal, there are no spinal complications and the results of the analyses are all clear. In my opinion, she could be released today. I'm worried about her emotional state. No signs of the family? We have two emergency cases waiting for beds. - Can I pay in dollars? - Yes. I'll pay you back. I don't know when, but... Taste this, it's good. I have to deliver the medicine. Of course. I'll leave you some money. You'll be needing it. I don't know how to thank you. Let me help you. It makes me feel good. You're so young and so alone. Well. I haven't managed to get your father out yet. Did you see him? Yesterday I was going to meet you... I spoke with him. He's fine. He wanted to see you, but that will happen soon. Just a few more signatures and he'll be free. I guess you'll be here all day. Look. This is my cell phone number. Call me and keep me informed. OK? Thank you, sir. I don't know what I'd have done if you hadn't... Hi. Have you seen Gonzalo? He went out, but he didn't say where. Why are you dressed like that? I'm getting married and I wanted to cheer Gonzalo up. What's wrong? Don't scare me. Come over here. My husband is an idiot, he won't even go out anywhere. I know what you mean. What kind of nodule is it? We'll know that after the biopsy. I can't make a diagnosis before. - And who can remove it? - I'd go to Dr. Vidaurre. He's an expert and can remove it without unnecessary risks. He was my mentor. Vidaurre. Never heard of him. Where does he work? He's a very special doctor. He hates private practice and all the commercialization. You know, an idealist. He works at the General Hospital. You're sending me to a public hospital? Isn't there anyone else? Vidaurre is the best. Colonel... Don't you think Helena looks lovely? I'll say goodbye now. I wish you all the best. - I'll pray for you. - Thank you. Are you ready? All the paperwork is finished. You just need to sign the statement for the police and I'll take you home. Do you want a wheelchair? I can walk, thank you. What if I don't sign the statement? Do you consider it's inaccurate? - How is he? - He'll be fine. He withstood the operation and there were no complications. Did you get the medicine? Wait outside. He'll be taken to his ward once he stabilizes. You asked me for this and a man never says no to a lady. I've got one ticket left. Call me on 3354412, tell me your name and you'll win a ticket for the concert. Hello. What's your name? Stefany. I can't believe it! I've been calling for hours! It's your lucky day, Stefany. Can you go to the drugstore and ask for the medicine on credit? While I was holding her, the doorbell rang. But she said.. "Don't answer it, don't speak, kiss me, just kiss me." Are you buying or not? - Straight on? - Leave me here. It's close. I am responsible to the doctors for your health and well being. If anything should happen to you... I won't be at ease until I leave you at home or with a relative. It's a formality, you understand? You can't leave me with anyone because there isn't anyone. I signed the statement. Why do you keep bothering me? I can sign a document that releases you from all responsibility. Where are we going? What are you doing? Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? Mr. Chauca! What is it? This afternoon, in this building, the police arrested Manuel Pareja Rodríguez, alleged member of the "Colina Group". Police sources said Pareja gave himself up without resistance. Police also stated that he was willing to declare and inform about the paramilitary group's activities and to name his companions. Fuck you, Pareja! Where are you going, boss? His cell phone is off. This is terrible. Everyone is here except for the guest of honor. I don't know what's wrong with Gonzalo. He always plays it cool but really he loves flattery. He would never miss a party like this. They say success changes people. Jenny? It's you. Don't you have a key? Proud and cocky. That's my Eva. That's why she drives me crazy. Rapturous beauty, sullen expression, and with such pouting lips that when I see her I can only think of pressing them against mine. We're late! There are thousands of people. Let's go. Can you lend me money for the ticket? I'll pay you next week. You don't have a ticket? You're crazy! This afternoon there was a sign saying they're sold out. You should have told me. Now I have to go alone. I'll get into that concert even if I have to kill someone. Eva, I have two tickets. Come with me. I told you, doll. I'm your only hope. No one ever mentions the shootings at Chan Chan and Mansiche. No one talks about when the Apristas were shot in revenge. How can I forget if I was orphaned that day? Didn't I tell you? The APRA will never let him rest. Grandpa. Are you OK? I feel... as if I've been beaten. Help me with the pillow. Help me. The doctor said the infection is controlled. I'll tell him you're awake. Do you want to watch TV? Don't get him angry, Lucho. This beautiful verse of Calderón de la Barca that we all learned, because when I was walking the streets, very often alone, I'd ask myself when would this end, when would I see Peru again. And I swore I would be with you after death, in spirit. I would have the strength to bring my spirit here to be with you. And I kept repeating that beautiful verse which says.. "I dream that I am here, bound in shackles, and I dreamed I was in a better condition. What is life? A frenzy. What is life? An illusion, a shadow, a fiction. Possessions are nothing. All life is a dream and dreams are just dreams." And it's like a dream to be here before you. And it's like a wish that has been granted to be here before you. And it's as if I were dead and here before you. And now he's quoting poetry at us, the smooth-tongued bastard. So this is your beach house? How long will you keep me here? It's up to you. - Just name a relative. - I told you, I've got no one. We all have someone. What about the father of your child? There is no father, no child, nothing. You've had a hard time. The accident, losing your baby... But you're young. You can get pregnant again. Why are you so scared about been mixed up with me? Are you hiding from someone? Is there a warrant out for your arrest? I'm going to the store. Do you need anything? Where the hell were you? I'm here, aren't I? Attention, everyone! Stop the music, please. All right. Let's welcome our guest of honor. I want to propose a toast to you, your career and all your successes. Cheers! May these 1,000 shows become 2,000 and many more! I'm telling you nicely. You need an invitation. Are you deaf? I don't want to go in. I'm asking you to call my girlfriend. I've done that. Give me a break. Chauca! What's wrong? What are you doing here? I need to speak with you in private. Let's go outside. It's an emergency. An emergency? What's happened? We have to leave. There's trouble. And go where? What's wrong with you? Your mission's over so now you ruin my party? There's no time to lose. I've risked a lot by coming to see you. Precious minutes that may be very costly. We need to leave. It's now or never. What are you saying, idiot? You're my girlfriend. I don't want to leave you. But if you don't come with me now, you'll never see me again. I want to know what's going on. Why the hell do you have to leave? Wait! What's wrong? Nothing. Please, Gonzalo, you're being such a bore, come on. Excuse me. I think I'd better leave. I don't feel well. He must be stupid not to see how great you are. I think we should be going. You've had a lot to drink. Drop dead! Leave me alone! Don't speak. Words are superfluous. I'll take you home. Let's go. The chauffeur is in the limo. Let's get something clear. I don't want to see you around here again. Hurry. I won't take another step, until you tell me what's going on. We've been walking in the middle of nowhere like a pair of idiots. I want to know where we are going. Answer me! I just need you to trust me. I'm completely innocent. But I'm in danger. They're after me. You've been saying that since I met you and nothing has ever happened. Cut the bullshit. I'm leaving. Is that why you wanted to marry me? To leave when things got tough? What's happening isn't so bad. We can start a new life far away from here. This country is shit. I can't just leave like that, as if we were criminals. You think anyone will care? You're leaving nothing behind. We've got nothing. - At least I have a job. - Oh, yeah? Putting make up on some self-centered asshole? For a salary that's lousy? I'm offering you a new life away from here. We'll go to Ecuador and then straight to Canada. They need workers there, artists. Anyone can do computer graphics. You've seen my work. It's top class, it's art, it's personal. And you're a great make up artist. You'll soon find a job. And they pay by the hour. But first we'll sort out our papers and get married. Do you know anyone in Canada? Look. That is the way back to Lima and poverty. That is the way to the north and money. You decide. You're an idiot. Mr. Peñaflor! I didn't know... Carry on. Please, carry on playing. Is anything wrong? - My father...? - All's well. I only came for a moment. I wanted to know about your grandfather's operation. But, play. Please, play. What...? Wouldn't you like to swim in that beach? The beaches in Ecuador are better. How are you going to swim? Naked? - Hey, take it easy! - Stop it. Don't you like it? - Feel what you're doing to me. - They'll see us! What are you doing? Hey! Get out! You can't swim. Your wound might get infected. I won't let you risk your health. Let go of me. Don't touch me. Get out of my life! Let go. Have you kidnapped me, or what? - Let go! - Stop screaming. Be quiet, I said. I'm not going to hurt you. - Don't touch me! - Shut up! Don't touch me. Stop struggling! I'm not going to hurt you. That's it, grandpa. Bit by bit. - He has to wear the mask. - But he can't breathe. That's not because of the mask. We have to protect the other patients. If you're scared of infection, why not move him to another ward? I don't want to go on. My arms aren't strong enough and these things are bruising my armpits. It's not easy, but you will learn. Do you want to be carried everywhere? You have to make an effort. Lucho does as he's told. Have you been discharged? But he's a living corpse. Or are they getting rid of him? If they're sending him home to die, I'll sue the hospital. These are the results of the liberalism he defends. The doctor has ordered further tests on him. Take those away. I won't use them. I'm a cripple, a useless parasite. A former student of yours, a friend of mine, Alberto de la Mata, told me to see you. It's getting bigger every day. It began as a mole a few weeks ago. We need to remove that. Is it serious? By the size and color, we need to make a full extraction and then send the tissue to the lab. It may have reached the dermis. If that is so, the removal can be risky. What do you mean, risky? I'm going to issue an urgent request for theater time. I'd like to operate tomorrow. My secretary will give you all the details regarding the procedure. And then go to the lab for the tests you need. Good day. All the military bowing down to Montesinos. It makes me sick. Did he call you? Look, there's the next one. Is it you? No, it isn't. Do you know him? He did everything but kiss his ass. What am I doing here? What am I doing here? Why the hell did you have to come into my life? That's what I say. That's what I say. They should all be put in jail. They're criminals, thieves, they have dishonored the glorious uniform our heroes wore. What's keeping Lucho? What's the matter? He would say Fujimori knew nothing of this. Let's go. It's the fifth hotel. What's wrong? They say we can find cheaper rooms. We're drawing attention. That's dangerous. What's wrong? I need money. What for? Are you blind? I can't go round dressed like this. Mr. Lobatón has been charged with being one of the people who set fire to the National Bank. Isn't "El Negro" hearing that case? No, not anymore. It's Judge Fonseca. So what's the problem? He owes me lots of favors. He used to eat from your hand, sir. That should be enough. You should speak with him personally. He won't see me, and his secretary won't transfer my calls. - Do you have a larger size? - Let me see. No. I don't love you. I don't understand that woman. He wanted to get married and she turned him down. I'm in love with someone else. Her mother told her they were brother and sister. I love another. What do you think? Look, do you have my size or not? I'll try it on. And now we have our news summary. Our reporter is on the line from outside the law courts. Manuel Pareja was taken to Lurigancho prison after being interrogated regarding crimes against human rights. The lawyer for the accused, a supposed member of the "Colina group", said his client had agreed to make a full confession. He has named those companions who remain in hiding, as well as the crimes committed by the group. The capture of these assassins is imminent. And you said I was paranoid. A poor guy unable to kill. I didn't speak so you wouldn't get involved, but now that you know... - What was that for? - You're a fucking moron. How could you drag me here with that "new life" bullshit? Now I'm your accomplice. I have nothing to do with any of this, but now I'm in league with a murderer. I can't believe I was so dumb. I was following orders. What was I supposed to do? Have you never heard of "enforced obedience"? If I didn't collaborate, my life was in danger. They were capable of anything. If I told you what I saw, you wouldn't believe me. Besides, you knew, but you wouldn't believe me. Didn't I tell you they were after me? That's all in the past. We're here now. We have to look ahead. At least, we're together, we're a few steps from the border, on the verge of a new life. While you were in the shop, I met someone who can get us false passports and... Just shut up! Where's our cheap hotel? I want to sleep. I'm tired. Eva. - What do you want? - Your mom... Eva, go to the pharmacy and buy what you can. I've marked the most important ones. Now? OK, I'll go. Will I go with you? Why don't you go to hell? I'm going ahead. You shouldn't treat him like that. He's a nice boy. Mom, he's a dickhead. They don't even respect one's age. It's a complete lack of consideration. Let me hear. He's about to announce himself as candidate. That's the country's next president. As a candidate, what I propose is the economic reconstruction of the country. Now he wants to build up what he destroyed. Only the APRA will save Peru. They should begin by saving you. Why don't you ask your party for a artificial leg? Write to Garcia saying you're an old militant who suffered persecution and jail. Lucho is right. An artificial leg would be better than this. Of course! Go ahead, a vote is worth a leg! I can't say anything else. Thank you. What are you filming? - It's a news story. - About the hospital? I have a brother in there. I can tell you about the doctors, the lies about the social programs. Do you have anything to do with the game show? I wanted to be in the dance competition. I even wrote in but they never called me. What a pity, I work for another station. But I do know people from a talk show. Do you want to go? - How much do they pay? - I can find out. Call me. Mr. Money is a powerful man. Very powerful. Are you a friend of Fonseca's? Give him this from me. Another big shot. I wouldn't get involved, if I were you. No, he's just small fry. I'm helping out a poor family. I didn't know you had a heart. Look who's coming. Mr. Fonseca. It's been a long time. Hello, Mr. Peñaflor. Where have you been hiding? - Are you very busy? - Yes, very busy. I left something for you. It's not much, but I'm sure you'll be interested. Everything helps, as they say. Speak to this lady. You do remember her, don't you? Just call me on my cell phone. I've had a few wasted journeys trying to see you. Didn't you hear he has been busy? But he'll take care of it tomorrow. Isn't that right? Excuse me. Outside the law courts there are hundreds of people... Waiter! Another beer, the coldest you have. I can't believe you were one of them, a murderer. They say they were paid for each job. What did you do with the money? I bet you spent it on whores. Don't talk rubbish. The guys at the top kept the money. That's the way the world works. The rich get richer thanks to our poverty. Is that the guy you are waiting for? Juan Solano never imagined what he would see. A mutilated, rotting corpse. I usually go by the dump, but I never thought I'd find something like that. I ran to the police station to report it. The D.A. authorized the removal of the still unidentified remains. The body was taken to the morgue. Surprisingly, the victim's ID card was found among his clothes. He was Antonio Polanco, the forensic anthropologist in charge of the Santa mass graves. As you will remember, we interviewed Antonio Polanco on this show. Give us the details, Flavia. It seems to be an act of revenge or intimidation by the "Colina group". But Manuel Pareja's statement could shed some light on this crime. Were you involved in that? Let's go. Helena Polanco may have met the same end as her husband. Let's see the report. Our reporter went to the General Hospital. Mrs. Helena Polanco was brought there by Colonel Hector Revoredo. It's known that he was recently discharged but had previously been in the Intelligence Service. We have Sergeant Canchaya's statement. He was on guard the morning Mrs. Polanco was brought into casualty. Yes, Colonel Revoredo came to the hospital. I can't say anything else. What's wrong? Did you appear on a video paying tribute to Montesinos? Good night. Very good, Flavia. Great story. Our ratings will go through the roof. Let's celebrate. My treat. First let me get this shit off my face. She looks better than I thought. That girl isn't bad at all. Cheer up, man. The show was great. You need a drink. No, thanks. I wanted to tell you, I'm leaving the show for a while. - What's wrong? Are you sick? - Why do you say that? I'm just tired. That's all. Excuse me. I'll say you're in the Caribbean. Everyone is behind us, and that's the most important thing. What are you doing here? I'm getting the material ready for tomorrow. Are you authorized? Does the judge know you are here? He asked me to stay. He said we were behind schedule. Has anybody spoken with you? Has anyone offered you money for...? You know... Money? Why would someone offer me money? I don't know if you're stupid or you just act it. I'm not an "eye for an eye" man. I always take out both eyes. Therefore, comrade Alan, I demand you return the dollars which you arbitrarily confiscated from... For the last time, shut up! You can hear your shouts outside. Keep it up and they'll move you to another ward. It would be a blessing not to see this APRA militant's face. Listen, Mercedes: "Comrade Alan: as an aged APRA militant whose father was a martyr in the Trujillo revolution, I welcome you and express my full support to you as candidate..." ...since you will finish sinking this country. "My name is Victor Alcántara and along with Haya de La Torre and you, dear comrade, I shared..." ...all the treason of your party. What treason? That scoundrel confiscated my dollars. I'm fed up. You keep whining about 4 measly dollars you lost. Even if it were one dollar, damn it! Send this to pathology. Mr. Del Solar, see me tomorrow. - You finish up. - Me? - Yes, you. Or can't you sew? - Yes, but... Couldn't you do it, doctor? - Bad stitches would be... - Don't worry. They're well trained. Will you cover that with a bandage? Yes. It can't get wet, or be exposed to the sun. Will it leave a big scar? Kind of. When they take the stitches out, I can have plastic surgery, right? When will it be possible? Gonzalo. Do you have a minute? Let me introduce myself. My name is Rodolfo López, and you could say that... I know this will interest you. What happened to your face? I'm an assistant in the video investigations. I have valuable information and I think we can both benefit from it. I know that happens. You should talk to the people at my TV station. I don't deal with those things. Who should I ask for? Do I just turn up there, or what? Tomorrow, I'll be dismissed. There's talk of an investigation and a lot of videos. The D.A. is getting a warrant for your arrest. My arrest? Bribery of public officials, influence peddling. I saw a draft of the warrant. I hope you don't have any cameras in here. When will the warrant be issued? A couple of days, I guess. I have to go. - Susy... - Yes, sir? Book me on a flight to Miami, first thing tomorrow. - Leave the return open. - Very well. Another thing. Do you remember... Do you remember Mercedes Lobatón? Find her and bring her here today. - She has to sign some papers. - I'll do that, sir. Leave your message after the tone. Gonzalo? Where the hell are you? I don't believe you went to the Caribbean. I'm waiting for you at the TV station. Are you really going? Answer me if you're there. You can't just leave me like this. Last night's accusation was picked up by all the media. There's a radio interview with a friend of Polanco's. Can we get 4,000 dollars? What for? You did a good job, But I'm not giving you a raise. I don't want a raise. I need the money to buy a great scoop. We are here with a member of the group exhuming the mass graves. Did you report Mr. Polanco's disappearance? We weren't surprised when we didn't hear from him. He was planning to spend some time with his wife. Had he received any threats before this? Yes. But he didn't take them seriously. We never thought those people would commit a crime like the one we saw. When we saw the footage of Antonio's body in that dump... We're all very upset. - How long are you staying? - Two days. Chauca? Are you Martin Chauca? No, you've made a mistake. I'm Luis Vidal. Don't you remember me? Come here. There's a warrant for your arrest. I can't let you leave. Don't do this to me. If you don't help me now, I'm screwed. You just have to sign the exit permit, that's all. - Please, Vidal. - I can't let you leave. You should go to Puno. It's easier through Bolivia. Next. Gonzalo, please open the door! Come in. - Sir... - Did you find her? It wasn't easy, but we did it. - Are you feeling all right? - I couldn't be better. Here are your tickets. You leave tomorrow at 7:00. I've moved all your appointments to next week. What papers does Mercedes have to sign? I'll see to that. Thanks for everything, Susy. You can go. Come in. Your secretary told me I had to sign some papers. Sit down, please. - Would you like a drink? - No, thank you. I've got Bailey's. Girls like that. Or would you prefer champagne? This one is excellent. I bought it in Paris. - Let's open it. - Please don't bother. Can't you guess why I sent for you? Make yourself comfortable. I've got some good news for you. Tomorrow, your dad will be home. They've signed his release. Well? Are you happy? Thank you, sir. I don't know how to thank you. Let's drink a toast. You can't say no. Cheers. Bottoms up, as they say. That's it. - Do you like it? - Yes, I do. It's sweet. I'm glad. Let's change the music. Let's see if I have anything for a girl your age. How was your day? Did you visit your grandfather? Victor, waken up or else you'll say I made it up. Look who's with Montesinos. There he is. One of the most important leaders, one of the big shots from your party fell too. Now, what do you say? Come on. Let's hear how you defend him! You're going to say that Alan knew nothing. That he did it on his own. Those clothes! Looks like the dead man was taller. - It's very elegant, Rodolfo. - You like it? This is for you. Thank you. For you, Eva. I know roses are your favorite. What are you on about? I don't like any kind of flowers. I prefer chocolates. Don't be rude, love. Did you inherit some money, or mug a millionaire, or what? No... yes... A distant uncle died. I've got something else for you. For us? - But... - Take it, ma'am. I know that you're in need of it, and I wanted to help make things easier for you. No, I'm very grateful, but it's too much, we can't accept it. Of course we can accept it, Rodolfo. Thank you. How much is there? - Can I keep this? - It's all for you, my dear. Thank you, Rodolfo Valentino. You're the greatest. - Can I go, mom? - Shall I go with you? Once we get to Piura, we'll withdraw your savings. With what ID, idiot? You can use your passport. And get arrested for using false ID? We'll find some way to get money and buy a ticket to Puno. I've got friends over there. Friends like Vidal? With friends like that, who needs enemies? I hate this damned heat! You know what? You can go to a police station and make a report. Say all your papers were stolen. They'll give you a certificate. Then you request your ID from Lima. In the meantime, we'll wait somewhere safe. Bolivia is different. Not so much control. No. It's over. What? You're screwed. They're going to find you. Montesinos had lots of money and they found him. Who'll protect you? What do you mean? I'm just a small fry. - Who cares about me? - I do. Get lost. You've fucked up my life enough. You're all I have. Don't do this to me. Angélica, please. Did you like the champagne? I'll open another bottle. No, thank you. I have to go to the hospital. I think you're drunk. Poor little thing... I don't feel well. Take it easy, little one. I'll make you comfortable. Tomorrow, you'll see your dad. - What's up, jerk? Who invited you? - Let's go. I'm staying here. I'm having fun, you won't stop me. What's going on? Get out! You want the cops sniffing round? - Throw him out, not me. - Get out of here, both of you! What would you do without me? What would you do without me, my sweet, beautiful Eva, - of reeds and roses made, - You're sick, you're a psycho! Now that Byzantium smothers me and my blood sleeps within me like lazy cognac? Was there an accident? I'll call... No, don't call anybody. - Take this. - No, sir, I can't. - Take it, and sort this out. - No, sir. - Who is it? - I don't know. Someone left her here. Didn't you see anyone? Helena? Helena? Victor... Victor, don't get upset, but Mercedes is in Casualty. My Mercedes? Why? She's out of danger, don't worry. But she'll be here for a few days. Was she run over? Did some bastard mug her? What happened? My God! Why are you in my room? What's happened? We have to get married, Eva. It's the right thing. What are you talking about? We have to get married. We spent the night together, and you enjoyed it. You really enjoyed it. I'll keep the promises I made during the night. You're a psycho and a pervert. We haven't done anything! - Mom! - She went to the hospital. Before she left I asked for your hand. I want to marry you. Will you have me? I'll buy you a diamond ring. You're crazy. I'm sick to the teeth of you! I love it when you get like that. It's a melanoma, as I suspected. Malignant nodular melanoma. A month ago I didn't have a thing. I can show you photos. Those nodules grow very quickly. They invade the dermis from the outset, so it's almost impossible to diagnose them in time. You must start chemotherapy as soon as possible. - Good morning. - Good morning. What's the problem? I'm running late. - My flight has been called. - Just a minute please. - Mr. Peñaflor? - Yes. You can't leave the country. There's a warrant for your arrest. Do you know who I am? - Come with me, please. - What are you doing? You'll regret this! We're transmitting live from the airport, where the well-known lawyer Arturo Peñaflor has been arrested. He is now being taken directly to the law courts. This is an outrage. I haven't committed any crime. This is all a set-up, but it will be clarified today. I was never in Mr. Montesinos' office. I've never bribed a judge. I'm going to report this to international organizations, and I'm going to sue the state... I want to report that man. What happened, sweetheart? Hello, my friends. I'm back again, full of energy and with lots of news, to begin a new stage in the show. The first novelty is that I've come back, fully determined to lead a journalistic revolution after the latest events that we've been through. That I've been through. It's being... It's being said that... I am destroyed... and have become... a wreck, a despicable human being. But... I'm not going to... I'm not going to respond to that. You can see me, as upright as ever. The TV guy. The stud. And adored by men and women of all ages. What was I saying? Right. I was saying that... I'm back again... to introduce... the show... You look so handsome. It's great. What are you waiting for? Or do you still think they'll bring the false leg the party promised you? Forget it, Victor. I don't need a false leg. I can manage with these crutches. Who will you vote for? Old people aren't obliged to vote. Goodbye, brother. Goodbye, God bless you.
