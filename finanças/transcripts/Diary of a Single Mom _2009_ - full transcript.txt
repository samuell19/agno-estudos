Since I was the last of eight children, my father overruled my mother and named me after God's best miracle, the ocean. My name's supposed to mean endless possibility like the ocean, but... But much of my life, I didn't really have much possible. And sometimes, I'm not sure I got any ability. But today, I'm trying to live like Daddy always said, "Make any new day your best day." I'm Ocean Jackson and this is the diary of a single mom trying to get ahead in the world trying to hold her under. Yeah, baby, you're gonna make my life a lot easier. Here, maybe you should try it. Apartment needs a little work. But then again, I hear your father taught you to fix any that's broke. Maybe you can fix me. Wow! A little paint, bleach, elbow grease... This is a beautiful arch. Yeah, it ain't beautiful how they left the place. Kids, go check it out. Why is there a gas grill in the living room? It's probably stolen. Look, I got some new tenants moving in today. It's all written down for you. So there you go! Um, you got some good-looking kids. Then again, you're a good- looking woman. And Ocean, I like that name. Which one you named after, the Pacific or Atlantic? Both. Oh, I like that. Mister... Buddy, call me Buddy. Buddy Chase! Buddy Chase, are you in there? I've been leaving you messages for weeks. I got leak city upstairs, under my sink, my shower, outlets don't work, Ocean meet second floor's Lupe Ramirez... Okay, no, no! Don't try and distract me because I need you to do your job, mister... Ocean Jackson. New apartment manager and onsite repair person. Oh, hell no. She's a woman. Oh, hell no, how did that happen Girl, I don't mean no offense, but Tricky Dick, here, like to play Houdini and I'm sick of his disappearing act. 'Cause it don't scare me to move. Move, Lupe. See who else will put up with you coming up short every month. All right, listen. Deposit slips are in there, any information you need, it's in there, contact numbers... If you need anything else, give me a call. Hello. Whoa, whoa! Hold on. What about my... You know what? I ain't through with you Mr. Buddy Chase. Mommy! We measured and according to my computations we've gained approximately 270 square feet of more living space than what we had at Grandma's. Um, he's a genius or something? Sort of, he's on scholarship at the Kennedy Academy for the gifted, so to be there, you got to, kind of, be a genius. Mine can't even spell genius. Yes I can! J-E-E-N-U-S. See, just like his daddy. Okay, speaking of the devil. Come on baby, let's go. Hurry up, hurry up. Go on. J.J., you and Sophie just stay right here, I'm gonna be right back, all right? Sophie, baby, don't cry, I told you I was leaving just play your video games. Take care of your sister, all right? I love you. You know what? You and your sister... Mind Miss Ocean now. Can I just go say hi to Dad? Boy, I already told you, no. If I don't go now, there's no telling when I'm gonna see your daddy again. Girl, you know how it is. Mama needs groceries. Do I look okay? Yeah, I already know my breasts are my best feature but I ain't bragging about them. You know how they say, "God takes anything you love too much." Juan, I'm coming! Just so you know, she won't be back for a while. Groceries, Sarah. Come on, let's go play. Ian, please, Grandma can't concentrate with all that noise. I didn't really read the lease, so I don't know what to put on. Too many decisions. How they could think that this will make me more independent. If your Grandpa Bill was here, he'd have the... Auntie said that whenever you say Grandpa Bill's name, I should shout, "He's dead!" She said that? What a bitch. But you said Grandpa's in heaven with my mommy and Jesus, right? That's right. Yeah. I'm sorry, we're not purchasing anything today. My mom doesn't wear much make-up. Young man, do we look like we're selling anything? We're tenants. Temporarily. Oh! Well, come on in, my mom's the manager. Mom, Uncle Bo and Trina's here. So that's the bathroom and you know... Uh A little paint and a good cleaning... Ah, baby, I know you, you'll have this place laid out. I'm so proud of you, Ocean. And I know your daddy's is up there with his chest poked out. And you know that Trina can help you in getting this place together. Oh, no, Uncle Bo. I mean, this building, my kids and trying to... You've got a lot of your father in you. Straight and narrow, no detours. But if you live long enough you'll find out that life has got a whole lot of detours, especially when it comes to family. Every time my sister decides her child don't exist and she got a new man, I'm supposed to... At least my mama's got a man... Stay out of this, Trina. She started it! So I'm gonna finish it. See? Now that's a detour I can't take. Keep her at mama and yours because I... I'm just not going to put up with her mouth. Baby... Do this for your uncle. Before I had my little drinking problem, didn't Uncle Bo try to save you? You know a whole lot of those things that you did, remember? It was Uncle Bo that kept it from your mama and daddy. I was the one that told you that you you were moving too fast. And to stay away from that fool you ended up marrying. But, Uncle Bo, she... I'm trying to stay sober, baby. And God knows I am, I mean, see? Almost steady. I'm not quite there yet. But I really want to keep Trina from going down the same path. She's already done come home drunk once. And I don't want it to be twice. She needs somebody stable. Like you. There ain't nobody in our family more stable than you, baby girl. That you got from your father. But Uncle Bo is hoping that... You got your heart from me. She got to know that in my house I got rules. No, Ocean's my mama's baby sister. Yeah. But I hate her. Oh my gosh! And everybody else in my family. They all get on my nerves. Yeah, but at least she's not a drug like the rest of them. I miss you, too. There are three families that stay in the building. But they always seem to congregate in my apartment. Uncle Bo says it's because of my name. Everybody wants to swim in the ocean. I guess. All I know is together we seem to stay afloat. You don't know how hard I've tried to like Mike-the-right. Oh, girl! You and your baby daddies. You should go check on the babies. Oh, they're all right. They sleep late. Stupid dial up! Froze right when I was in the middle of something important. Oy, what're you doing that's so important? You're on this thing every time... Um, what are you doing on FriendSpace? Uh, it's for school. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I was thinking that if we pooled our money together we could get a high-speed service... Oh, I already got cable. No, a modem! So that you could study, we could pay bills online, operate our lives a little better. Operate my life a little better What? Coming! Oh, Ian... What are you doing to him? Where's his clothes? I washed them. Oh, and I've been meaning to give Ian some of the clothes J.J.'s outgrown. He will look so fly. We don't need your handouts. And I didn't tell you that you could come up here to see these people. Okay, hold on a minute! Lupe! Who the hell you calling "these people"? Because all we was trying to do is help you out. Lupe, Lupe! Hey, what's all this hollering? You know what? I'm about to get Miss Avon straight. You must be Sophie's dad. You spit her right out. Ian come on let's go. Yeah, this is Ocean, she's the new manager. Hi. Nice to meet you. Ocean? That's a fly name. Where the kids? Where's Sophie? Next door. Lupe, what'd I tell you about leaving my daughter alone? Don't even start that mess because you come up here twice a month and all you do is find fault and I'm tired of it. Look, if you don't want to take care of her, I said I will. Ian let's go, get your clothes later. I take care of my baby. What, you're gonna come here twice... Wonder If the floors of single mothers are more worn out than other floors. I used to hear my mother walk the floor at night. Mumbling and humming... Especially if one of us hadn't made it home. Auntie Ocean. Girl, don't have a heart attack. Let me tell you just what happened, there was... There was just... They wanted me to go and I said no, but when I left earlier we... We was driving, right, and we just... We just got lost, like, "Where are we going?" Hmm, well, we got lost. And I went and it was so much fun. I didn't do anything bad. We got lost, though... Yeah. You are better than this! You hear me? Yeah. Peggy? Peggy? Hi. I didn't mean any harm today and I'm sorry and if I'm overstepping, we had leftovers and... We don't need anything. But take it anyway. No. I hope I'm not overstepping again but Lupe and I have a proposal and, um, we were thinking if we pool our resources together we can help each other. Thank you. She really called me Avon? Don't worry I've been called worse. Okay, if, uh... Thanks again. I'm... All right. I went to mass. Okay, and maybe a few other places. Can I sleep here? I just can't face Mike-the-right tonight. Maybe my kids will be better off without me. So maybe finding a way to love people... ...in the midst of their struggles is what we're all here for and to raise these kids. Work Source, this is, uh... We develop your mind and body. This is Ocean Jackson, how may I direct your call? Uh, please hold. Just a little setback, Ocean. Having a little bit of dyslexia is like... Like having a little bit of stupid. You're not stupid, Mommy. Aw, baby. She's right. You're so close. Little more practice, more computer time... I practice at my desk. But between the phones, Kayla and... Yeah, well, some of the staff thinks that, uh, to be fair, maybe it's time to enroll her in daycare or preschool. I just... By the time I pay for daycare I may as well stay at home with her myself. I'll tell you what, let me talk to your case worker, maybe we can work something out. Work out me sitting in the office all day before they tell me I'm wasting my time? Ocean, every problem has a solution. All we have to do is get our knuckleheads together. No matter how frustrating it may be, we'll come up with something. Aren't you always telling me your father said, he didn't raise no quitter? Kayla, come with me. I got a little secret. Come on. What's going on, Lupe? What? Miss? Peggy? The school called. Ian is there but he's not registered. Ian's at school? I'm sorry. Peggy, somebody told me today, that every problem has a solution. I don't know how to do this by myself. None of us do. When my father died, he left eight kids for my mom to support. Okay? I dropped out of school. So, I used the skills that my father showed me fixing things and I ended up making more money than everybody else. It wasn't a whole lot of money. But I did what had to do. All I'm saying is, you've got to start somewhere. Where? Turn. Juan, stop. Please just listen to me for s a sec. Look, I'm just say, would you love me any less if I had to go through the surgery... You're tripping! You got two tits, why would I imagine you with one? Look, I got somebody waiting on me. Okay, well, what about your son who's waiting on you? You act like that's the only kid I've got. Well, he's the only one I got by you, so, I ain't worried about anyone else. Lupe. I didn't want to say anything in front of Peggy but, uh, I need that money back that I gave Buddy Chase for you. Okay, it's... I'll get it from Mike tonight. Mike? He said he was hoping all of us would go trick-or-treating together. Um... Oh! Trina! Yes. She looks so good. Okay. You look nice, like a young lady for once. I look like I'm going to church. But Lupe said you'd like it. She gave it to me. Auntie Ocean? Mm-hmm. Why is Sammy asking me about his dad all the time like I know? I don't really remember him, but he keeps asking me how he looks and if he had a middle name. I don't know. I told him to ask you. Ian, stop eating that candy. Sammy, I want to see your homework before you go to bed. And none of this "I got it done, Mama." 'Cause the only way you're gonna stay in that school is... On scholarship. Hey, guys. I got the job. I'm so happy for you. Break it down, baby. Only thing is, I start working evening shifts at first. So, I might need help with Ian. Um... I'll pay you as soon as I get paid. We'll work it out. It was that makeover. Every time! I never could've done this without both of you. And, oh, now I can get my furniture and have some friends over and I used to have a lot of friends and maybe even invite my sister. Okay, but first let's get your costume. Oh, I... I have to start work tonight. But Grandma, we're all going together. Oh, I know sweetheart but we need the money, okay? Save me a chocolate? Okay. Love you. Have fun. Bye. All right! Oh! Great costume. Thank you. I knew it was you, Daddy. Oh, you did, did you? Do I have to go? I'm supposed to meet somebody. Yes. You look nice. Daddy! Come on, guys, want to check out a real party? Door-to-door's for kiddies. 'Sup Mike? Go ahead. Me and Sophie will be fine without you. We always are. J.J. come with us, please. Mama? Mama spends time with you and your daddy all the time, baby. J.J. never gets to be with both of his parents. You have fun, love you. Hey, let's go catch up with the other kids, okay? I wanted a family. Even adopt J.J. But while I was trying to be our shutter from the storm, Lupe's out there wishing for a hurricane. Hmm. Maybe when she finishes school I can afford to go back myself. I want to teach the little ones. Hmm. I ain't never met a man that's wanted to be bothered with little kids. Well, maybe you need to meet someone now. You know, men can impact a kid's life just like a woman. That's why I don't know how much longer I can take this arrangement between me and Lupe. Sophie. There you go. And Ian! Yes! We never talk about him. There's no pictures of him. What could he have done so bad for you to erase him out of your life? And mine, too. He might want to know I'm smart like him. Oh, and you couldn't have inherited your brains from your dumb mama, right? Boy, what's taking you so long finding him? There, that's him. That's not your father, Sammy. But he has the same name. He said he was married to you. I don't know who this is, or what he's saying. I've never seen that man before in my life. What did you tell him? Did you tell him where we lived? Huh? He could be some kind of... He could be some kind of child killer. Did you tell him where we lived? I'm not a snitch. You're not a snitch, boy? Ocean, he's just scared. Get your hands off of me! Don't you ever touch me. Don't nobody touch me! Ever! Any nipple discharge? Well, if I'm getting my freak on, maybe. Lupe, this is serious. Ocean, I'm studying to be a medical assistant, I know the drill. Spongy or hard? I don't want to talk about this. Well, let's talk about you and Mike. What? Girl, please! He is a good man, but I could never be happy with him but maybe you can. Both of y'all are dull, stubborn... All right shut it up. Why are you trying to change the subject? Okay, I'll go to the doctor. I just wish I wouldn't have said anything. I took her out. I don't like her anymore. I'm going to cook you the most romantic candlelit dinner. Uh And what about the kids? Trina can occupy them. All right, well, there's the kitchen. And I'm going to go in the back and change my clothes. Kayla? Baby, let me know when you hear the bus. Why don't I go meet the bus? You're on. Come here. Stop playing, girl. Come on now. Come on, you know you want it. Get out of my house! Auntie Ocean... Ah! Where's my bat? Come near my niece again, see if I don't call the police! She's underage! Whatever. You go back there and change them nasty sheets. Pack your bags and call your Uncle Bo. I want you out of my house. Uncle Bo, I tried with her, but she got to get out of my house. Well, I don't call that trying. Trying is not taking a drink when you've drank everyday of your life. That's trying. Trying is not throwing in the towel after two months. You know she's going to do something. She's a kid. A kid sleeping with everything walking. No, I'm not. He's my boyfriend! You don't need a boyfriend at your age! You had one at my age! No, I didn't! You sure about that? Uncle Bo... I'm just saying that if you're really trying to help her... She's not my responsibility! Sure she is! She's your family! No, both of you all back up off me because you're not going to make me the bad guy. Nobody's trying to make you the bad guy. But I got to tell you one thing, you sure ain't the Ocean that I used to take care of. Bo, that's not fair. Shoot! Life ain't fair. If you waiting for fair you'll be waiting in line for a long time. The one thing I asked you to do for me... It ain't one thing. It's always something if it ain't money! Oh! Now we going tit for tat. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Yeah, you did. You think you're better than me. No, no, I don't. It's just... You're trying. Come on, Trina. I'll be waiting in the car. Because in a minute I might ask your auntie for a glass of water, and Lord knows... I want to watch her try to get it. Happy Thanksgiving. Our first Thanksgiving in the building and we've all become like family to each other. He should have been up here by now. I, at least, wanted everybody together for prayer. Huh. It's disconnected. Hope I'm not late. No! Ocean, I really couldn't decide on desert, so I bought three. My wife is... You didn't have to bring anything but yourself. I bet you say that to all of them, especially if they have a bit of good news. I worked really hard. Mm-hmm. Yes, you did. I called in a favor and got your results early. Now, it's time to fill out those college applications. Everybody, this is Mr. Lou Bailey. My savior, my hero. Mike, Lou. I'm Mike, just Mike. Not a hero, not a savior, just Mike. Happy Thanksgiving. Hey, Lupe, good to see you as well. I'm gonna go tell Peggy. Okay! Sometimes our problems are bigger than we ever care to admit, especially to ourselves. Stupid, stupid, stupid. They don't want to be a part of my life, they never did. They only tolerated me because of my husband. The very same man that, um, gambled my very life away. You know, Ocean, I went from millions to food stamps. And since I started working, I don't even get those anymore. Guess what? Well, I might now, since I got fired two days ago. The owner felt that I was... Wasn't grateful enough for his Viagra show of affection. Back to square one. And I'm either too stupid or too old to master surviving on my own. Oh, Ocean, how do you do it? You. I passed my GED because you helped me. You wouldn't let me give up. So let me return the favor. Everybody grab hands, close your eyes. We are so grateful for each and every one of us, who by blood or by love have become family, and as family, for every problem, there is a solution. Amen. Anybody want to sing? I just want to say that, um, I am thankful for all of my blessings, and, um, which is, every person in this room. And I wish you all, health and healing. * Good bread, good meat Good gosh, let's eat * Hey, hey, hey! I don't get an invitation to Thanksgiving? I'm still part of the family, huh? Juan... Are you going to call the police on me? What are you doing? Watch where you're grabbing, son! Dad... Juan, let's just stop, not today, baby... Let's go... I don't want to be disrespectful... What are you trying to be, the head of somebody's household or something, man? Baby, please not today, Por favor! I'm sorry, he's just drunk and... Come on, let's go next door, me and you. No! Come on... No, just... Come on, you're going home with Dad. What about Thanksgiving? Come on, right now, you're going home with Daddy. Mike, please don't do this! I can't control what you do with your life. I can control what you do with my daughter. Mike, stop. Please stop, Juan! Mike! Hey, baby. Remember me? Your husband. This is my surprise. Mike, what are you doing? Are you serious right now? Are you serious? We are having Thanksgiving dinner! I can't believe you! There are people up there who have been cooking all day, just calm down! Seriously, please. I'm taking my child! That's my child, too! Look, I... I'm not leaving her in a dangerous situation. This is not a dangerous situation! Sarah wouldn't want you to forget this. Sarah says thank you, J.J. I have to take her. No, you don't. I can't leave her here. I can't leave her with you no more. I can't do this! I love her too much. I can't do this, sorry. Okay, I love her, too. I'm sorry. Sorry! I love you, baby! I need you. Sometimes you wonder if change is really possible. Please forgive me. And if I can earn a GED, when I started out reading at sixth grade level I'm so alone. Maybe it's possible that my ex-husband could've found God and never use me as a punching bag again. I'm asking for another chance, Ocean. If you're my daddy, would you read to me? Of course I will, baby. Ah, goodness. Children are so forgiving. They love even when they're conceived out of hate. Don't leave me out! I like baby stories. I get the best seat since I was the only one at Grandma's who told you where to find Auntie Ocean. Okay, that's fair. "Where's Spot?" Kayla only came into being because her father decided after years apart, he wanted me back one night. He was drunk, so he wouldn't take no for an answer. I survived. I sometimes am working so hard, to survive and take care of them, I... I forget how much I just want them to also be happy. And right now, they are. Happy to have a father again. How can I ever take that away from them? Every morning, I try to take a moment to pray. Even if it's only a second to close my eyes. And acknowledge God for the blessing of a brand new day. And the hope that this day is going to bring something different. I just don't understand why you had to lie to him. Girl, no man needs to know that the ladies have been under the knife. Lupe, they did not cut your titties off. You had a biopsy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Okay, today is just not my day for saying the right things. Um... I know it's scary. I mean, it's got to be the most scariest thing a woman can go through. You want me to fix you something to eat, before I go to work? If I still have a job. I've missed so much... No, just go. Um, I'm just going to lie down before my kids... I miss my baby so much. Sometimes, I hate Mike for taking her away. I'll see you later. What you doing home? How come you're not at work? Senior said I didn't have to go to school, 'cause I wasn't feeling well. Hey, baby. I did like seeing him move in, just on a trial basis. He bought us this new basketball hoop I'm going to work at having them see me laugh every day. Which is easy to do, you know, with Mike around. Who Lupe thinks has a crush on me. I'm like, "Girl, please!" I don't need somebody else's baby daddy. It's hard enough managing the one I already have. I was not under him! I know what I saw. Huh? Maybe you giving it to him, since you ain't giving it to me. Look, I'm sorry. Okay, I just... I got some good news just for once, I came into some money. And I got you something. Okay, look, just don't go nowhere. Mmm! Right? Thought we could go out, have some fun. Go dancing. Look, no kids. Just want it to be us again. Hey, look, I got us matching cell phones, too. Sam, where did you get the money to pay for this? So what, you my mama now? Huh? Then whoop my ass then, since I did something wrong. I don't even have the sense to breathe right, huh? Can't do nothing right in Ocean's book. Damn, Ocean! Every time I think we've taken three steps forward you make sure we take five steps back. Like do you know what that feels like? To not have a job? To not be able to provide for my family? I know that you're trying. But they're about to turn the lights off. The rent is paid and nothing else. All that money that you spent, it could've... Hello? Yeah, this is Ocean Jackson. Are you two coming back or what? Ooh! This looks like it was made for me! Don't you think? I can work this! I'll be there. Uh... It's, uh... Uncle Bo... He's... He's been in the hospital. Trina put that dress down. This goes back to the store. Y'all, um... Clean up the couch for Uncle Bo. What? No! We are not having that alki in here! Another person in this house? Last I checked all of this here, mine! I like this dress, though. You are so stubborn. You can tell you're my daddy's brother. If Daddy listened to the doctors, he might still be here. Okay, I promise Uncle Bo'll take care of himself. If I stop drinking and exercise and get the blood flowing in my legs more. Hey. What? Chicken butt. Hey, you know something else? I love you. I can always count on my little Ocean. I love you, too. Hey, what's up, old man? Heard they're going to cut off your toes. Sometimes, it's easier to start with what you're scared of, the devil you know, and to figure out what's ahead for your life. Is this your card? No. Hmm... Is that your card? I used to play house and dream what my children dream, that one day, I'd grow up and live happily ever after on a rainbow. But now, I think I dream in gray, if that's the color of fear. I'm so scared that my life will always be like this. Sitting in a dirty tub somebody forgot to wash out. Wondering if this is as good as it's ever going to get for me. Oh, Ocean, I know it's early, but... I was wondering if I could borrow your cell phone. My service doesn't seem to be working and I wanted to follow up on a few jobs. It's 6:00 a.m. Nothing's open. Good morning, Bo. Good morning, Peggy! What's wrong with your cell phone? I keep telling you that you're qualified for these programs... I didn't come up here to discuss services! I just want to borrow your phone to make a few phone calls! Okay, okay, you don't have to wake up everybody in the house! Sorry, Bo! Um, here, I need it back before I leave for work. Okay. Oh, I must have pushed the wrong button! Wow! Trina sure has a body on her for a 13-year-old. Looking good behind that desk! Work Source, we offer a wide range of services. How may we serve you? Please hold while I put you through. Girl, you just keep on surprising me. So, that's a good thing, right? Yeah! Where did you get those earrings, I haven't seen those before. My girlfriend at school makes them. Those do not look homemade. Trina, there was something that I wanted to talk to you about. Oh, no, I knew you didn't invite me down here to play receptionist! What did I do now? Nothing. Trina, you're a very smart girl. Yeah. For the first time in school, I'm doing good. Aunty Ocean, I'm getting A's in math and science! My teacher says I can be an engineer or something! I got to figure out what they do first! I am so glad that you are finally motivated. I just want you to conduct yourself... How do I put this? Um... Senior loves all you kids. You know that don't you? A lot. But maybe Trina somewhere in your mind, you've got it twisted that his caring is something more. So we talked about boundaries... Boundaries against me? What are you talking about? I picked up his phone by accident, there was a picture of you. Not Kayla, not Sammy... Or you? That's why you're really mad, isn't it? Senior said you were jealous, that's why y'all broke off before! He shouldn't be talking about me, to you. Why not? You discuss me with him. How I'm not your responsibility. That you only let me stay 'cause Uncle Bo asked you. But I thought we was doing better. That you were even starting to like me. But you're just like my mom. Always accusing me of something. Me trying to take her man when all I wanted was her. And it's not like it was a picture of me naked or something. God, so when you want me to leave? I'm not talking about you leaving, Trina, I love you. Oh, good, I need a hug, too. What's wrong with her? Growing up too fast. That's how those girls do! With their hot asses, 13 and on fire! Anyway, girl, I came here for a reason. I need you to get my results. You didn't make that call? You work right next to the hospital, all you have to do is walk five steps and you could have got your results. I'm trying to work up my nerve. I'm starting to hate hospitals. Really, I'm starting to hate everything except maybe... Well, except maybe Mike. Hmm. Girl, I tried to give him to you, but then you went and pulled a husband out of the hat. Look, I'm telling you, just... All this medical stuff's just got me so scared, I can't do this alone no more. I need somebody I can count on. I know you know what I mean, I mean why else would you even think about being back with your baby daddy? Give me the phone and the phone number. Medical clinic. Hello. Can I help you? Hello? Hello? Hold on, please. Hello? How can I help you? This is Lupe Ramirez, I was just wondering if you have my biopsy results. Please hold for a minute. Inconclusive does not mean that everything is okay. Before you start celebrating, you need to go see your doctor. Girl, inconclusive means Lupe dodged a bullet, and... That's all I care about. What is this stuff on my floor? Okay, look, starting tomorrow, you, me and Avon are going to be having a fitness class, 'cause we all need to get healthy Lupe, you see this stuff on the floor? Uh-huh. It looks like confetti. Oh, man, I told them to keep the lights on for me! Know I don't like to come home to a dark house! Happy birthday! Baby, Trina and I've been planning this for a month! Whoa, whoa, whoa, I kept it a secret and you know that's a lot of work! Trina! Ocean, Ocean, Ocean! Happy birthday, Auntie Ocean! Make a wish! You happy, baby? Very! Mmm! Rather tasty! Building up my husband points. Whoo! You go party. I'm going to sit here and relax. Let me show you how to do it. Whoa! Auntie Ocean, I'm gonna go lie down, I'm tired! Oh, Trina, the party just started! Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got a special project! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, Trina! Yeah, thank you! Yeah! It's beautiful! We've been working on this 24/7! We? Oh, yeah, I'll be real happy to give you all the credit, old man! Since us peons went back and forth to get... I love it! I love it! I love it! Thank you! Both of you. Thank all of you for making this one of the best birthdays I've ever had. * Party over here Party over there * Oh. Wow! "To Ocean, buy something just for you. "After all, a lot of people wouldn't know what to do without you. "So, take care of you. Love, Mr. Bailey. "And flex." I got the garbage out. And I was going to vacuum but I thought it might wake up Bo and the kids. It was a great party, wasn't it? Yeah, it was. Where's my pillow and blankets? Mr. Bailey is right. I'm flexing my mean muscle, so what the hell? It's my birthday, and tonight I wanna feel taken care of. * Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Whoa! Don't you look nice this morning! So, what do you think about me moving out? You know, your mother's always got a bed for me and I'm thinking about singing up with that Older Workers' program. Uh, I think that is the worst idea I've heard in a long time. Somebody needs to still take care of your leg. And, Uncle Bo, I've asked Senior to stop bringing liquor into this house. I do not want you tempted. Well, keeping me sober is really not your responsibility. Taking care of grown-ass folks who are old enough to know what they're doing, should never be your responsibility. But taking care of you is my privilege. And Mr. GQ in there? You know, baby, I've been trying to hold my tongue 'cause you grown. But I gotta ask you, why in the hell did you let that fool back in here? The kids need to know their father. Then let him come visit! Not lay up here on you like he's been doing. And what does he contribute to the household besides sleeping most of the day? That's not fair! He's been working with this cleaning business, and they clean foreclosed homes when people move out. Oh, really? I don't know what kind of cleaning he does, because every time I see him come back here, he's just as clean as he left out. You could do better. Well, you know what they say, "It's always easier with the devil you already know." Until he surprises you again. Senior. Senior. Wake up. Mr. Bailey's on his way and we gotta go. There's only one place I wanna go but I need you to take me there, baby. Stop playing. Slip some clothes on, I don't want to keep Mr. Bailey waiting. Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey this and Mr. Bailey that. Don't you think he's a little old? Got you thinking you're college material. You barely finished eighth grade. "See the dog cross the street." That's not funny. Look, you can't take a joke no more? I'm just playing with you! Come on, look, you can't take a joke? Uh-uh. What happened to that happy face? Um... Can you keep an eye on the kids? I, uh... I'm gonna wait for Mr. Bailey outside. You know the best thing I learned at AA? Simple. Change your mind, change your life. That's what today's all about. So don't let nothing or nobody get in your way. Dad thought me everything about houses. So, I was thinking maybe... Maybe I wanted to be a teacher. Maybe even a lawyer. No, no, no. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. It's not funny. You see, Ocean, that's all achievable. Roll up your fist. Come on, come on, come on. Roll up your fists. Now bend your arm. Flex. Every day I want you to flex your "me" muscle. Every day I want you to do something, think something, wonder about something, pray about something, anything you have to do to make it about you. What Ocean wants. Me? Well didn't you see what I wrote about Senior and him cutting hair, and, uh, how he wants to open a barber shop, and he wants to go into business together. Flex, Ocean! Flex! I want you to start that sentence again, I want you to start it with, "What, I, Ocean wants." Oh, come on! Ocean, give me another excuse. Tell me about how you had to repair your family. How you had to move everyone forward and forget about you. And you are not moving you ahead! Flex! Don't stop flexing. Flex! I'm flexing, damn it! Hmm... It felt good to yell at me, didn't it? This is for you. That's more application papers just in case you lost the others. And my phone number is in there, just in case you need to talk. Thank you. Oh! Just in time to work out! Girl, I told you, we need a whole building fitness program. Let me show you, I've got my routine worked out. So, happy belated birthday. Heard your party was great. Would have brought you a present but your husband seems a tad bit protective, wouldn't you say? You think? Girl, come in and workout with us! Look, I've decided no more hospitals for me. I've decided to become a personal trainer. Look, I, I just can't take it anymore. And Mike, he went and bought me all these books on exercise and physicology and stuff. Look at me, I can't even pronounce the word right. But I am serious about this, girl. Hey, my grandma was looking to take something for her toothache. She's spitting out blood and I'm kind of scared. I'm sure you knew your insurance card is not valid. Oh, my! Did my husband send me with the wrong card? Oh! I thought you were a widow. Oh... Perhaps I could speak to a supervisor, someone who understands? I already did that. That's what took me so long. That card hasn't been valid for over a year. Do you have any other kind of insurance? A DSS card? Uh-uh. Why is she... Let her handle it. Peggy needs to advocate for herself sometimes. I'm sorry, what is that? Medicaid! You do understand what that is, don't you? I have a right not to be shouted at. Nobody is shouting! Well, a public broadcast would be quieter. Look, lady, nobody cares! Before you can see a doctor for non-emergency ailment, we need to know who is gonna be responsible for the visit. I am responsible for the visit! Uh-uh. I'll do the talking! Here's $100 down-payment. Now. Please, may I see a doctor? Excuse me, don't you think you're being a little... Little like a bitch! Okay, look, here's how it's gonna go, sister girl. This is our friend here and her mouth hurts! So from here and now, we'll just do the talking for her. Now, we both know how this works so get out those special papers, the ones for people who can't pay, we both know what they are. And you really need to stop acting like her bill is gonna come out of your paycheck, okay? So, let's get to work so she can see a doctor or me and my girl here, are gonna turn this place out! And you ain't heard loud till I start shouting those "isms." You know the ones. Racism, ageism, classism, um... Professionalism, which you certainly get a failing grade on. And you know I work here, so I know people. So, should we do this in Spanish or English? And do you wanna add anything, since, you were supposed to be doing all the talking? Uh-uh. You got it covered. I just don't like people trying to talk down to me, that's all. Hey, look, I'm willing to talk up to you, whatever you need, baby-cakes, but she's gonna see a doctor and that's right about now. Thanks, sweetie. Thank you. Girl, I know you're tired. It's past midnight. There's no sense in waking the kids up now, we'll just get them in the morning. Why don't you go on up and I'll get Peggy settled in. You sure? Girl, you have a husband waiting on you. Avon and I ain't got a soul waiting on us. Do we, Avon? - Uh-uh. I think I like the sound of that. Having a husband waiting on me. Oh! It stinks like liquor in here! So damn dark. What are you doing? You don't think I know What are you talking about? You've been cheating on me, huh? Huh Do you know what time it is? It's 12:30! I know what I think! You cheating on me! Once again, I ignored the writing on the wall. Traded my heart for so little in return. And once again, I let the devil fool me. Mom, what are you doing? Auntie Ocean, it is 6:00 a.m.! The hardest conversation a mother ever has to have with her kids. Is explaining away her own failures. I changed the locks. So if Senior comes by, do not let him in. I don't care what he says. What if he's not drinking? You mean he can't come in his own house? This is my house! Maybe that's the problem! Okay, see, today is not the day to mess with me, you understand? As a matter of fact, I don't want to see nobody! Mama, does is hurt? Why'd you let him come and live with us if he'd done this before? He's your father, Sammy. What happened between me and Senior is, um, grown folks business. But I know that he loves you very much! How can you say that? If he beats you, how can you say he loves me? But why did he hit you? That's what I wanna know. He's never raised a hand to any of us. And we're kids. You must've said or done something. I don't care what I say or what I do. No man is allowed to lay hands on you, Trina. That's not true. Every man that has laid hands on my mama did it because she wanted him to. A woman can make a man hit her without speaking a word, okay? For some children, you need a magic eraser. To erase every bad memory, every violent event, every bad excuse. The ones some adult gave them or the ones they made up themselves to excuse the inexcusable. J.J., you're just being stubborn. I'm not gonna be gone for long. It's just that your daddy and I have some things that we need to talk about. Like, we might be getting back together. Would you like that, sweetie? But I thought that you and Mike were starting to talk again. We do. It's complicated. But you know your mama loves you. No, you don't! At least when Sophie was here you actually stayed at home sometimes. J.J... You always do everything for her and nothing for me. That is not true! Hey, little man! Hey, sexy thing. I can always tell when you get dressed up just for me. So, you ready? What if we bring J.J. with us so that we can get a bite to eat together? And then we'll just drop him back off at Ocean's so we could have our talk. Don't spend it all in one place, little man. Come on, Lupe, let's get out of here. Maybe I don't want your money. It's probably stolen anyway. That's my boy! Don't ever back down from anybody, not even me. Come on, Lupe. Let's get out of here. We really had a good day. Yeah, you sure are happy today. Closest to perfection as one could get. I've got the bestest, smartest children in the whole wide world and I did something... Uncle Bo! Oh! No! Girl, I'm glad you don't play cards. Because I look at your face and see everything you ever thought to think. We all die of something, might as well be diabetes. Maybe I should get you to emergency. I ain't going nowhere except to sleep on this couch. Give me some of that Ocean sugar so I can dream me some sweet dreams. I stink, huh? My breath stinks, my leg stinks. I'm just a stinking son of a bitch. I'll get cleaned up after a little shut-eye. Be back on that train to righteousness. What No. No, I'm not scared. I was just putting the pillow behind your head. Well, stop looking at me like that. Not like I'm disappointing you all the time. I'm your Uncle Bo. At least I got that son of a bitch out of here. Uncle Bo took care of it. Nobody messes with mine. If he stayed, no telling what he would've done. Uncle Bo took care of it. Bo take care of his. Yes, Uncle Bo, you took care of it. You take care of everything. Okay. Okay. I don't want to scare mine. This diabetes keeps me so dehydrated! You got a beer or something? Sometimes God reminds you all is not lost. Because if you have a covenant with him, to borrow Lupe's words, there's always a snap-back. An opportunity to change. To start over. To manage your fear. And of course, prayer is the best weapon we have. Always. If we ever hope to silence our silent screams of despair. You're two months behind on your rent and I can't hold the landlord off any longer! And I'm not gonna let him fire me! Well, it's just that Ian's medicine is so expensive. I tried taking him off of it, he was totally out of control. Maybe next month I can... You don't have another month! He's gonna evict you. He's gonna put your stuff on the curb. Peggy, you can't sleep all day and bake all night, pretending that things are somehow gonna be different. You gotta do something different. What about assistance? No one in my family's ever been on welfare! Well, now the rich are the poor. I'm not poor. Okay, you're not poor. You just need a little help. What about food stamps? We have food! Maybe welfare is for you and your... What you were gonna say was welfare was best for me and my people. Look around you, Peggy. You're my people now. Actually, the color of welfare has always been white. It's just the way the economy is going, it's getting painted whiter by the minute. Come here. Oh! I'm scared for you to answer that. What is it, Trina? Girl, stop screaming in the phone! I can't understand you! Auntie Ocean, I didn't know what to do! I called Senior and he came here right away. All of us kids, we were so spooked. It was scary. Uncle Bo was having seizures! He was bleeding and he was screaming! Mom, it was so scary. If Dad hadn't been here... Sam, I'm always gonna be here for you, no matter what happen between me and your mama. Mom, are you okay? Dad and I had a talk. And I understand where he's coming from now. It's like what you said, when he's drunk he can't help himself. Mom! I thought I told you to take that back to the store. But, Auntie, Senior let me have it because you said you didn't want it. Oh, my God, man! She's a baby. A baby! How could I be so stupid? When all you wanted to do was just... Uh-uh. Look, I just gave her this dress. Why you tripping? I just came over here to talk! Talk? Ain't nothing for us to talk about. Get out! Now! You disgust me. Auntie, Senior said he was sorry. Shut it up! You are a kid and you should be a kid! Yeah, she got a woman body. But this is a kid. My kid! And I'll go through hell and high water to protect her from anybody. Now get out! Look, Mama, he said he wasn't gonna drink anymore. I'm not, Ocean. I haven't had one drink since I left. I even apologized to Uncle Bo. He promised. His promises ain't worth a dime. You're always saying you gotta forgive. Son, there's one thing you don't know about your mama. She don't always practice what she preaches. Oh, okay, you want a sermon? Is that what you need? Okay, here you go. I deserve better! My kids deserve better! And it don't include you, ever. Now get out! I'm gonna count to three. And then I'm gonna call the police. Okay. Come here, baby. Please don't go! Mama, you don't have to be so mean to Daddy! I love you, baby. I tried, Sammy. Get out! Man, shut the hell up! You can't keep me from seeing my kids, Ocean. I'm gonna see them with or without you. I'll see you in hell first. Yeah, I think we can arrange that. One... Two... What else I don't know, Trina? All he did was give me a few gifts, Auntie Ocean. Nothing else. Some nights, all I can do is ask God why. What did I do to deserve any of it? Today was supposed to be my day. Got started out with so much promise. And then it deteriorated into a lot of "what ifs." What if I had stayed home? Not left Uncle Bo alone. What if I had never let Senior come back in the first place? But at some point I guess the "what ifs" are nothing but an opportunity to renew your faith and possibility. I'm Ocean Jackson, and this is the diary of a single mom trying to get ahead in a world trying to hold her under.
