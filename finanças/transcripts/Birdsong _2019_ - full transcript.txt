The music business is an animal that devours the dreamers together with the feathers in which they were flying. That animal is dying. Shiratori Entertainment Building, Tokyo My name is Asuka. This is my song. Thanks for your attention. BIRDSONG Sub:Nueva Keep up the tempo, Asuka. - Mama ! - Hello ! Hi ! - Are you already leaving ? - Sorry, it's already 6:00 a.m. There's breakfast on the table. The stairs, I mean the elevator was broken again. That is how our Fumika gets strong legs. See you tonight ! The Stars of Tomorrow sing their songs on Mysong ! The only music show on your TV ! From the streets of Sapporo here are the Stars of last year: Eiji and Naoki. - I can do better. - I'm sure you can, Asuka. Why don't you participate ? Maybe. What would be your song ? The vacuum-cleaner song ? This building was built in 1978 after the earthquake. I remember it well, it was the Miyagi era... The Music business is still mourning for the loss of Ryo Omoto san. Exactly one year ago, Ryo Omoto san was found dead under suspicious circumstances. His death is still under police investigation. He was a great musician and performer. But foremost a fantastic TV show host. Rest in peace, Ryo san. But the good news is: His show can go on ! Are you a Star of Tomorrow ? Mysong is your TV show ! Can you play a tune ? Do you have a song in you ? What do you have to do ? Tells us your name and play us your song ! Stop ! You are standing in the bed ! You have to stand on the cross. The cameras are there and there. Are you feeling well ? You look a bit pale. You have good energy ! Good luck ! Your name ? Asuka. How do you write that ? Like 'bird' ? We are almost done here. You are next. It's a rehearsal so nothing can go wrong. The live show is still 4 hours away. Who is that man over there ? That's the owner of this building, Mr. Akira Shiratori. He is the big boss of the music business. He is also my boss. Werk jij voor hem ? You work for him ? I'm a cleaning lady, in the nightshift. I see. I didn't know there was a nightshift. You are up. Good luck ! Asuka, right ? Sit down. No need to be awkward. Alright ! Let's go. My name is Asuka. This is my song. I hope you enjoy it. This is not possible. This is wrong. Stop this ! Stop it ! Is it true that you work here ? As a cleaning lady ? So you have access to these offices, right ? In the middle of the night when no one is around. Have you ever seen this CD ? This CD contains a remarkable song. A song which no one ever heard. Except me. Me alone. Because the man who wrote it is dead. Murdered. Probably. Now you come here. And you play that song. Can you explain this ? I don't know... I will call the police to sort this out. This is serious. This is a murder case. Hello. Can I speak to officer Yamashita ? He... What's that ? He... He took it. What are you saying ? He took it ! He stole my song ! That is my song ! Tell me how that happened. It all started one year ago. I was taking my daughter to the park. Fumika ! Look here. You see that girl singing over there ? Give her these coins. You are a musician, right ? What ? How do you know ? I saw you give money to that girl. Nobody pays for music anymore. Only musicians. You work for Mysong ? Yes. And I'm always looking for new talent. Do you want to give it a try ? I don't think I would... There's an open Mic stage next week in Nakano. It's a good place to start. Text me when you get there. I will see you backstage. I have to go back to save my prodigy from her fans. What's your name ? Asuka. I'm Murakami Mari. Nice to meet you. Please give it up for Asuka, ladies and gentlemen. And don't forget: free beer with an order for chicken ! That was not very good. I know. I'm very sorry. I do think you have potential. I never make a mistake. I don't know. Where did I put him ? Here he is ! Ryo Omoto san ! Do you know him ? He used to be the presenter of Mysong. Ik heb nog iets te goed van hem. He still owes me a favour. If you are sure you want to give it all you got I could ask him to coach you ! What do you say ? Coach ? I've never... - I don't know... - I do. Let's do it ! Mind you, it's not cheap... Again wrong ! I said minor chord, not major ! Megumi, the girl who left the house was Akira Shiratori's niece. Ryo told me. That's true. That's my niece. The events that happened in that house have seriously injured her. She turned her back on music forever. Such a shame. A great talent. That's enough. Thank you. Okay. That is what we call an empty song. Void, vacuum... There is nothing in it. It's a chicken. It doesn't fly. Look... Music is a vessel. A means of transportation. It transports emotions, memories. And your song doesn't transport anything. Because... you didn't put anything in it. Move over, please. I will try something. Look at the window. Witness the power of music ! Now it's your turn. Don't be afraid. Look at the window. Try to create something in there. A feeling. A memory... Or start with something you know. And take it from there. Fast or slow ? Slow, please. Look at that ! That's not a chicken. Thank you so much ! But... We still have a long way to go. Can you come back tomorrow ? Did Mari tell you about the money ? Yes. Of course. I'm sorry. Mari texted me to ask how it went with Ryo. I told her it was fantastic. But too expensive. To which she replied that there were ways to get money. Good money. 'Private sessions' she called it. Rich people could book a performer for an evening. Only classy stuff. Everything was handled through the Shiratori Music Website. So it was all legal, I thought. Mr Shiratori, I assure you, there is no such thing ! There is nothing on the website ? Switch the language to English, please. How come I don't know about this ? I was not aware of this ! Can't you do anything right ? Saved by the bell ! Curious to see what you will do today. Not now ! You piece of crap. With stuff like this you can get far in Mysong. But I think we should aim higher. Because we can. The raw material is there. We just need to uncover it. I think we've only just begun. I think we will need 10 sessions. Are you in ? Text Asuka: I want to do a Private Session. Text Mari: Excellent. You can start tonight. Will send the address. Tonight ? What is tonight, mama ? Nothing. New Artist : Bird of Paradise Available for Private Session. Of course they are. They're gone ! Both of them ! There is nothing different in this picture ! It must be my eyes ! What is all the noise about ? Fumika should be sleeping. My mother is going crazy. She said you and Fumika were gone in the pictures. I did not ! Yes you did ! I can't see Asuka ! Where is Fumika ? Don't worry about it mother. We all make mistakes. It's work. I have to go. Wait, Asuka! Can we meet up for a drink, tomorrow night ? Okay. Bye. Hello Kyoko. I'm sorry to bother you... I can't come to work tonight. Fumika is not well and I can't leave... A musician to play with ! There are drinks over there. Can you fix me a green one ? And take one yourself. It's a sake cocktail. But it contains absinth so watch out. This is Krautpflantzer. A music videogame. That's German for herbplanter. It's my latest addiction. Interesting stuff. Now it's your turn. Arakiba ? I am Arakiba ! What are you doing ? I'm looking for a weird ringtone. Like the sound of a bird. Never heard it before. Are you on Tinder ? I thought you were married ? 'I can't make it tonight, baby.' Goddamn ! Is that your wife ? Let me see ! She's gorgeous. So... So if you don't have plans for tonight... Maybe we can go for a drink ? I don't think so. Say... When your wife was cheating on you just before she left, how was she ? How do you mean ? How could you tell ? I don't remember clearly. It was as if she was no longer there. As if she was already making other plans. And everything I did annoyed her. That's when I started putting on serious weight. You were always fat ! We think you crushed her by lying on top. Telephone... That was the sign. She was always guarding it. Everywhere she went she took her phone. Let me check ! No problem. I have over 300 apps installed. I will find it ! Was it something like this ? No. Wrong. This ? Wrong again. This ! Are you Bird of Paradise ? What are you drinking ? Sangria. Do you want some ? No. I think we should go. It's time. I understand. I booked a place for us to go. A karaoke ? A karaoke ? No... Something a little more private. It's a room with a theme, What kind of theme ? Welcome on the Shinjuku-Love-Hotel-Express. Next stop is Fleshburg. After is Hardcore and Orgasm. The use of smartphones is permitted. Groping and sexual harassment is mandatory. I will sit here... and feel very tired. When I fall asleep... You can... and... You can take off my pants... You know ? Do your thing. I don't know what you mean. Are you a fucking retard ! What did you think this was ? I'll pay double... I'll pay 3 times... 4 times... Can you make a train-rhythm ? Yes I can. This is a basic pattern. What kind of tempo do you want ? Is the train going fast or slow ? Normal speed, please. Now it's your turn. What do you mean ? Now it's time to do it ! I thought we just... I paid you ! I need a drink. Can I bring you something, Miss Asuka ? Did you do all this to be on Mysong ? I don't know. The light of success can be very bright. Blinding even. I understand that. Ryo san was also blinded by that light. And when it went away... He crawled in all sorts of places to find it again. Raging against the dying of the light. Like they say. How did you get into music ? How do you mean ? When was the first time you felt the power of music ? When I was young I would walk around in my boring town and listen to music. I even sang along. I wouldn't dare to do that anymore. And then it felt like music changed my world. My world became beautiful. It changed everything. Music is a powerful thing. At least it used to be. Can I get my dessert ? First you need to wait for grandma. Are swans dangerous ? Yes. I once saw a swan... I'm going to the bathroom. I saw a swan break a man's arm. Where ? On TV. At work. Hello... Yes. It's me. I'm very sorry. But I... I can't do it anymore. It has to stop. Yes. No. What... Really ? What did he say ? He thinks that ? He said that ? I have doubts sometimes... Yes. Yes. I will. You are right ! I will give it all I got ! Yes ! Yes ! ... running around like that. Until she was exhausted. So cute. Who was it ? Who what ? Who did you just call ? No one. Don't be so suspicious. That's ridiculous. Why would you take your cellphone to the toilet ? I always take my cellphone. Serious ? My god ! You can really ruin an atmosphere ! Take your jacket Fumika, we're going. But didn't have dessert yet ! You promised ! Let's go. We'll get dessert later. Good evening, miss Bird of Paradise ! Come in ! You are really beautiful ! I made us a delicious snack. I'm sorry, but I can't stay. Something came up and I have to go. Not before you eat ! Chicken. I'm Kenichi. This is Kenichi-chicken. Sit down ! Let's eat ! You really are in a hurry ? Yes, I'm sorry I really need to... I understand. This won't take long. Could you put this on ? I would love to see you in it. Dream on. I won't tell Jin ! I think the size is good. How do you do it ? Excuse me ? Well... Make music ? Ryo-san says you are really good. I don't know... I'm just a cleaning lady. But you are Shiratori san's niece, right ? I work in the Shiratori building. On the top music floors. There's a room there... The Star Factory it's called ! I've never been inside myself. I once saw your uncle and Eiji san come out of it. And Eiji san is a big star now. I think the room is connected to that. Maybe you can ask your uncle to take you in there ? My god ! For a minute... I thought you were mocking me ! But you are just... incredibly stupid ! What's going on ? I never understood why you liked her so much. Now I do. Hello ? Incredible ! This is something new. You are amazing. Truly amazing. Get off me ! You fat loser ! I'm not fat... I think you are ready. Your lessons here are over. You need someone else to teach you. Not some loser. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... It's fine. Today was free. Because it's my birthday. I wish you the best of luck. I mean that ! Without luck you are nowhere in this business. Did you know Ryo... hadn't touched a drink in 5 years ? No. I didn't know that. Until that day. That is the day he died. On his 55th birthday. I truly wish... you can forgive him for this ? Making music together is an intense relationship. So this is how the story ends ? The girl wasn't wearing her glasses, he said... pop news: Today is Ryo Omoto's 55th birthday ! Former Mysong presentor and alltime Rock God but also Fulltime alcoholic, tried to commit suicide 5 years ago by drinking cleaning products. He failed but was clean afterwards ! Stay off the products and stay clean ! Happy birthday ! Ryo san. Cheers ! Kyoko san... I think something terrible will happen if I don't... If you leave now, you can never come back ! I ran... I didn't know what happened to Ryo. I begged Kyoko to give back my job. And buried my dream. And now you are here... Yes. What would be your song ? The vacuum-cleaner song ? I don't believe any of it. I should take her to the Room to see if she is hiding something... No ! You are not taking her ! Then I suggest we bring in the police. Please no... I will lose everything. I will do anything. She came out of an egg and turned into a beautiful bird. This is the song of... Asuka. It's about to start ! I am Asuka. This is... my song... We are ready ! Fumika. It's bedtime. But you said I could watch mummy ! Is mummy going mad ? Like grandma ? No, of course not ! Stop this. Make it stop. No, leave her ! She is ruining the show ! The girl is mad ! Who wants to watch that ? The sponsors will be furious ! The sponsors can go to hell. How do you mean ? You know the name of this song ? 'The Death of the Music-Show' You can still be a Star of Tomorrow. No. I know what I am. I want you to continue to make music. Yes, but not here. Is there nothing I can do for you ? No, nothing. Nothing that would improve your life ? Well... there is maybe one thing. I don't want to do the nightshift anymore ! Thank you very much ! Here is my next song. Let's go. Sub:Nueva BIRDSONG
