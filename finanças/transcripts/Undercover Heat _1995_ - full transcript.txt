All my life I've been she wanted to be independent. Now that I have what I wanted, being single, it pays me a little. It really pays me sometimes. I've had a father all my life and two older brothers, who never left me alone, they always protected me. I know they loved me, loved to pain. It was not just protection, it was more like house arrest. Teen boys are usually shy, but they were afraid of me. "More how Cindy is handsome. but don't approach her, " "if her brothers don't get you, father will certainly. " You know, I just wanted what I saw other girls get it. Let me cuddle. I didn't go Not even the prom. For evenings and parties, I pretended to have a leg up, because the guys weren't brave enough to take me out and remember yes the next day i had a problem, because society was laughing, telling me I'm shy. But telling me what they are had done what face they had gone to it or not let the guy get to know. I am alone now. I can finally act like a normal woman. Whatever normal is. I know you don't usually like it like this. I'm really glad that you trust me enough to let me please you. I always knew what you really wanted. You want this right. Yeah. I know you like that.

Shit, you don't do this no. I won't here well. -You're gonna hear it from me if you don't stop being a little more careful. I'm your partner and when you get hurt, it makes me look bad. What happened here? -Oh nothing Sarge. I just caught this kid tagging a wall. So I'm searching him and this other kid comes up to me and goes hey what are you doing to my brother so I said all right. He's your brother than you too. So I stand on the first one and I grab the second one's wallet and I open it up and there's this joint there. So the kid grabs it he tries to swallow it. So grab him by the throat and I start working that joint back up and that's when I decided to get hunt. Who had gone to a store to get a pack of yodels. Yodels? -Is around the corner she takes her hand off the guy. He pulls out a blade and stuff sir. -It's no big deal. Damn it Cyndi, I wish you'd take it easy. You know if your dad hears about this and I'm gonna hear about it. -You don't have to worry about that he's still in Florida soaking in the retirement sunshine. -Oh I know. 15 years we were partners and just cuz he gets his 30 and he takes off and leaves me with the two of you. Well that's my pop. -Well you know Sarge, if you want I can always call her two brothers up north and rat you out to them. No, no, no, no don't do me any favors. Hey you know the sheriff's not gonna let those two maniacs go. They're the best cops they've got up there. Lucky bastards living up north fly fishing on that River. Cabin the whole nine yards. -Do you like that. Apsolutely. It's my dream. -I never knew. I gotta go Sarge my sister's here. That's your sister. Well somebody in the family got the looks. -Thanks. You've been separated at birth we've just recently been reunited. Go on get out of here. -See you guys tomorrow. Guys. Mrs. V's. Yes sir. Yes you do. Now who referred you to us. All very well. Would you like to come over is this an alcohol. I see. Tracy? Yes, Tracy is available tonight. That's right. Why don't you give me your address and I'll send her right along. You? But you didn't call. Who was someone else. -I pretended. We like to pretend. Right? Yes, yes we do. Please, turn around. It's so very good at pretend. -Well, we're good at it together. Let's pretend, ok? Sure. Let's pretend someone took pictures of me and try the blackmail me with them. Ok. -What should I pretend the dude is such a person? Pay them what they want. Shut them up. -Now why should I pay them what they want. When I could just shut them up. -Why don't you leave me alone. Miss V finds out you trying to hurt me. -This is between you and me. Why don't you put that away. I'm the one with the power here. It's you that better run. Better run to the bank. See, I have all those pictures safe and sound. Power I said you had. Bullshit. That was pretend to your nothing. You're powerless. You're crazy. Never ever, ever call me crazy. White female 23 years old. Judging by the strangulation marks and the fact that. She's naked. I'd say she knew her. ID says her name's Tracy curve. Hm -Hm, what? Nothing interesting address. -I'm trying to get an answer out of you is worse than getting one out of a perpetrator. -Well according to this she lives at mrs. V's house. She must be one of mrs. V's girls. Mrs. V's? I've never heard of it. -What's that? Some pleasure palace in town. We haven't heard about. -Mrs. V's caters to very exclusive clientele. They're so far up the social ladder they get nosebleeds. Very powerful people with very old money. And they're protected. Protected real deep. So how do you know about all this then. Well now Cindy would it surprise you to find out I've been around the block a few more times than you have. Gold. You'll dog you. -No, that's not it at all. Why don't you two find a way to make yourselves useful. -Yes sir. How you doing mrs. V here? -And who should I say is calling, sir? Sergeant Gold. -And are you here on official police business? Yeah. I sure AM. -You got your search warrant. Well, no I don't why don't you just tell her it's sergeant Gold. So her sergeant Gold no warrant no entry. All right. Sport then I guess you'll have to tell her. And what would that be yeah. One of her girls is dead. There must be some mistake. Mrs. V doesn't have any girls. Well, if she did have some girls and one of them happened to be named Tracy Kerr. She might be interested in the fact that Tracy was gunned down this evening in a hotel room. Good night. No. What is it? What's the matter? -Tracy's been killed. Hello. Yeah, Gold. I'll be there in an hour. We got the forensics back on Tracy curve. -Yeah. It's just what we thought it was too. Hi guys. Thank you. I Sydney LC. Listen guys. I've been thinking we need to put somebody inside mrs.V's. Let's take it out. No. I think she's got a killer Jon on her hands. There's way too many powerful people hanging around that place for us to just sit and let it blow up in our faces. Okay. Then I'll go undercover there. Get out of here. Go in there. Are you nuts. What do you think an undercover hooker does. -Oh I don't know. Well, they don't stand on guys necks and choke them like you're used to. Unless they decided to pay for it. I can set it up. I know some of her John's and I can make sure that they asked for you specifically and all you'll have to do is play some Canasta. Mrs. V and the rest of the girls will think everything's perfectly legit. All you got to do is find her appointment book or something else it'll help us crack this case. You ought to be out of there in about two days. Come on Sarge. Why don't we just bust the place get a search warrant. I told you that won't work. They're protected. Okay, I'll go down to supply and requisition a hooker uniform. All right but I want to see it before you take it out of the building. -Okay. Come on Sarge. -It'll be all right. Well, that should send the department back a couple of grand. It's how well look at my new uniforms. Oh my God. Look at this. What are people gonna think. Know what I got myself into. Tell me. I can't be me. Oh I am looking at someone else here. You know being a cop doesn't scare me. But being a woman does. In the back of my head if I let myself do this. Now, I couldn't be a cop. No. Because you fantasize something doesn't mean it's gonna happen. I'm me, right. That's just a fantasy. Is't it. Oh my... You found that outfit down and supply. -Yeah don't I look okay? You look amazing I mean... -Alright, alright enough of that. We got some work to do here. -I already have everything down. No, we got some work to do here. You got to know this stuff cold. Now how long were you down at Allenwood with Tracy. -I was down for 18 months. Who was the warden at Ellen Wooden? -Louise Taylor. -Named for hacks. Bender Southpaw, Spinner and Hack and a half Harriet. -Allright that's good. Now we'd uh meet up a long rap sheet for you so if they check on it it'll look good. I also included the fact that you were Tracy's cellmate down there. Now our nickname in prison was Trey. -And if you get into any trouble just call if I squat. I'll take that place down bust everyone and your cover will still be intact. -Okay. -The John's I set up for you're gonna come in and ask for someone new and all they expect for their money is a cup of coffee. -Okay. And I look fine right. Yeah. I suppose so. -Well... Hey Sarge, take a look at this. -Yeah, yeah I'll be right there. What? -What, what. What do you mean -Nothing. I'm just not used to... -What? -Come on. You know. Hunt block you are blushing -Well, don't flatter yourself. Okay?

Miss Shan what can I do for you? -Well, after I heard my friend Tracy was gone I figured you had an opening. An opening? In what? You know at the blown he dust with me. Me and Tracy were in Allenwood together. I know what the deal here is. I'm working a long time. I see. Where? -No place like this... -Obviously. Well, I'm here to help. Miss Shan what in the world could you possibly have that could help me. Good business. -Ah, very well. Take your clothes off. -What? Take your clothes off. Let's see what your good business is. Good-day machine I don't have time for this. There's the door. Okay, see. You're priceless my dear. You are something that is virtually non-existent these days. What's that? A naturalism. An athletic non posed freshness. Please put your clothes on. It's delightful. It will drive the men wild. Thanks. Now, tell me why you're really here. Well, my friend is gone and I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to her. Without her I would have never made it at Allenwood. It's been really rough for me on the streets. I figured, you know, maybe I could come here and maybe I'd find a way to close things out with her and maybe do something for myself. She would have wanted that. well for the moment I'm going to introduce you to the girls. but I'm going to have to check you out. they're charming young woman this is Carol, Beth Anne, Rain and Victoria. ladies this is Cindy. hi -new girl? -if I haven't decided yet oh well what's the confusion. she looks like a girl to me. yeah. oh you're so funny miss Raine.

I should get turned on just talking about it. -yeah? -yeah. and I get turned on just listening to her. what else did she talk about? -about how even money isn't real power. how you have to you have to learn how to own people, you have to have something worth more to them than money. now where is all of our stuff? can you just forget about that now later you can ask -me. I'm the one to ask.
