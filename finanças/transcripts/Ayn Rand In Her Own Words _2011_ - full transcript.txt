We are, as religious people might put it, children under God and responsible, one for the other. Now, why do you rebel? What's wrong with this philosophy? But that is what, in fact, makes man a sacrificial animal. I say that man is entitled to his own happiness and that he must achieve it himself, but that he cannot demand that others give up their lives to make him happy. I hold that man should have self-esteem. Who are you, Ayn Rand? When I say that, I would like to know just a little bit of your vital statistics. You have an accent, which is...? - Russian. - Russian. - You were born In Russia. - Yes. February 2,1905. Petrograd, Russia. At that time, it was called St. Petersburg, which is Leningrad now. That used to be the largest city in Russia at the time, and comparatively considered not very old by European standards because it dates only from the 18th century. There's two sisters younger than myself. That is, there were three daughters altogether. I was the oldest, and then there were two younger girls. There were exactly two-and-a-half year intervals. That is, the second sister was two and a half years younger than I, and the youngest, five years. That would be my father. He was a self-made man, and he owned a small business which he had created himself, and that is very unusual for Russia. By the time I was born, he was already quite well-off. I wouldn't call it unusually wealthy, but I would call it middle to upper-middle class financially. He had achieved it all himself and had, besides, sent his six sisters through college, plus a younger brother. He had six sisters and two brothers. He was a man who held ideals, which I didn't discover until I was 15, very strong ideals, a man of very firm conviction. But you would never know it. He was predominantly silent, argued very little, and he was one of the most conscientious persons about his work, and that I have heard from colleagues and other people. He apparently was very good. And strangely enough, I learned later that what he would have wanted to do was to be a writer. But I liked him as a person, only, in childhood, I had very little to do with him. It's after we began to be political allies that I really felt a real love for him. I probably loved him even then much more than Mother. I'll say, frankly, it's a slightly painful subject in one respect only. She was so wonderful in being instrumental in sending me to America that I feel unfair in saying anything critical, so anything I say, can I say it under the preface that I appreciate what she did enormously? During my childhood, I disliked her quite often. We really did not get along. My big clashes with Mother in childhood were the fact that I was antisocial, as she would call it. She always demanded that I be more interested in other children. Why didn't I like to play with others? Why didn't I have any girlfriends? That was kind of the nagging refrain. I also knew that she disapproved of me in every respect except one. She was very proud of my intelligence. She was very proud to show me off to the rest of the family. I was very aware that there was a definite rivalry between her and her sister's husband, who was a rival with Mother about the accomplishments of their children. It was too obvious, and slightly embarrassing, that I obviously was the most brilliant of the six by every kind of standard, and this uncle resented it. But that was her attitude towards me. In other words, she would show me off, and I suspect, in retrospect, that she really liked me better than the other children, that I was the first one, and she made, I think, more fuss over me than the others, but at the time, I would never had said that I'm her favourite nor that any of us were her favourite. She also was unusually very badly temperamental. She would have fits of temperament, during which she would declare that she never wanted to have any children, that she is taking care of us because it's her duty and how much she hates it. And I remember thinking indignantly from as far back as I can recall that we did not choose to be born and what is it that we are expected to do about it, that since we could not help it, under what sort of obligation should we consider ourselves? It's the injustice, the irrationality of that kind of accusations that I resented very much, and as far as I was concerned, I simply ignored it, in the sense that it didn't make me feel guilty, it made me feel resentful. My feeling about the family was only to wait for the time when I would grow up and get out of there. It isn't that I considered myself so unhappy, it's just that I had a very strong sense very early that anything that I like had to be mine and not Mother's and not the family's, because my difference and my intellectuality always took the form of values. It would always be a succession of people, books, heroes in books, later in movies, that became the symbol of, "This is my world, and other things are not my world." 1914 was a big turning point in my life, anyway. Mother subscribed, for me, to a boys' magazine because of the adventure stories. Now, I remember one illustration impressed me. It was a picture of that Englishman you see standing at a wall with a sword or something, waiting for someone. But this hero, and his name was Cyrus, was the perfect drawing of my present hero: tall, long-legged, with kind of... You know, trousers and leggings, the way soldiers wear, but no jacket, just an open-collared shirt, torn in front, kind of open very low, sleeves rolled at the elbows and hair falling down over one eye, elements of my... At least the appearance of what is my bromide about my type of man were completely taken from that illustration. The first time they're presented in a story is that they're all in a cage, and the cage is being rolled through this valley to some kind of temple ceremony, and they're all scared except the hero. And I remember the image... The first illustration. He is standing, holding onto the bars of the cage Where everybody else is on the bottom, sitting down or cringing. Thereafter, up to the age of 12... That's the next three years... That was my exclusive love. It was almost mystical in this sense, that I felt it's... I'm totally out of the concerns of the reality of anybody. What they're interested in doesn't matter at all to me, because I know something much higher. The next important highlight would be the summer of 1914, which is when we went to Europe. Switzerland is my idea of heaven. It was kind of a world of its own, both the country and the whole spirit of climbing the mountains and seeing something unusual. We were on our way from Switzerland to Paris when the war was declared. And from then on, it was... That was the end of a world, which I didn't know at the time. I remember thinking that I was enormously annoyed and hoped it would be over with quickly. Well, the original plan was to go to several countries, you see, predominantly Switzerland. And we were caught by the war in Europe. And that was a big problem, because you couldn't come back, you see. Russia was cut-off. So we had to go via the Scandinavian countries over a mined sea, and the boat before us was exploded, and the one after us. We got through. I thought it was... at the time, it didn't have full reality for me, but I knew that Mother was terribly worried, that something very serious was going on. Ah, then the Russian Revolution was February 1917. Then the communist revolution was the so-called October Revolution, and that was in the... In that same year, October '17. And we left in the fall of 1918. By that time, there was a civil war going on in the south, in the Ukraine. And there were so-called White Russian armies. And we wanted to get out, to escape communism, simply. And Father got the permit to travel on the grounds that my sister, who had had pneumonia twice, needed to go to the Crimea. So that's how we managed to get out of Petrograd. Now, that was in the fall of 1918, and we came back in 1921. By '21, the civil war was over, and all Russia was communist. I began to suddenly find myself, In effect. Asking a lot of whys, in an abstract manner, but beginning to define the reasons for what I believe. And then I realised that What I was now doing is thinking in principle. Today, I would say it was a process of integration, really, but that I wouldn't have known then. I think it may not be irrelevant that that was the year of the start of the revolution. The first, the springboard for it, was the fact that I was very much in sympathy with the February Revolution, because, you know, it was the bloodless revolution, Where everybody was for freedom. And the whole atmosphere, though it was in a kind of a sentimental Russian way, nevertheless, it was all the glorification of freedom. In my terms, it was the individual. But today, I would call it the rights of the individual. Why the individual's right? Why is it right for him to be free? Why is the strong, independent man important? By what right can anybody tell a man What he should do or What he should live for? And, of course, then, when the October Revolution happened, that's when my first conviction began of a kind which I remember specifically concluding the one that I mentioned... I prefaced with it earlier... That nobody has the right to tell men to exist for the sake of the state, that the evil which before that I would have called collectivism, although I wouldn't know the word... It would be the group, the herd... That kind of entity now began to be statism... conscious. As far as I can account historically, that from as far back as I can remember, I was so busy mentally with my own concerns that I didn't develop any social instinct. In that sense, the idea of having friends was never my first concern. What I can't quite communicate is the unimportance of people, in that social sense, had for me. I decided at that time that I could never be in love with an ordinary man. And I told Mother and... And the older people... I was not secretive in this sense at all... That I'm in love with Kerensky. I remember them objecting to it, some of them sarcastically, and Mother just a little... Oh, indifferently, but slightly annoyed. She was always annoyed because my enthusiasms were always too strong. But I remember them telling me, how can I call it love? And I remember them saying, "This is just infatuation," or "puppy love," you know, terms of that kind, which made me stop talking to them, but it didn't bother me particularly, because I could not be in love with anyone but a hero. That was the only adult and important issue in this. And that attitude remained until my first year in college. In my last years in high school, when girls were beginning to go out on dates, I remember feeling a very superior contempt, "How can they be interested in just boys?" I have to have a hero. From the earliest age, I had the impression, even before the revolution, that culture, civilisation, anything which is interesting, as I would have put to me, is abroad. Now, I, in a general sort of sense, thought that I would probably be a writer in Russian. Therefore, I don't think I thought of settling abroad. But what it amounted to would be that I would probably live abroad, as many Russians in those days did, that in one way or another, what I would have considered my home would have been European culture. I didn't begin to even discover America till about the last years of high school. For the first time, incidentally, it was only the last year of high school that they gave us a small course on American history. Before that, in all history courses, they gave you only Europe, Russian history, of course, and European. And it's in this particular high school in the south Where I graduated, they had one course on America. And to me, it was the most incredible thing. Before that, America was mentioned in geography books, but not as history. I didn't really know about the Declaration of Independence or what the American system is until the last year. And I'm not sure that I even would have grasped it all correctly. I would not have had a clear idea of capitalism or collectivism. All I knew is that that's the country of individualism. That summer of 1921, we returned to Petrograd. And I went to college, started college that year. I went to two different schools in two different cities, and I was the top student there. In addition to being the top student, did they ever measure your intelligence and tell your mum and dad, "Oh, this girl is so bright. This girl is a jewel"? No, by... in my times, they didn't have those tests, and not in Russia. But you knew that you were smart. Oh, yes. Did you feel that school was too slow, that you were so far ahead of the material? - Yes. - How did you handle that? How did you school yourself, really, beyond the... the curriculum or curricula in the schools? Is that of interest to you? Yes, it really is. I always tried to sit in the back row of the class, and I put a book in front of me, and I was writing novels from the age of 10. I was writing screenplays at 8, but I was writing novels in class because I was... Otherwise, I would be terribly bored. I was never discovered because we had textbooks. And if you read ahead of the lesson that they present in class, you could know what the teacher said. I had to read the textbook just once, and then I knew the course. So, I really think it had a bad influence on me, on my working discipline. It was too easy and too boring. But how did it affect your working discipline? I never had to make an effort. I certainly did have to when I began writing novels. That's really difficult. But in school, I had no difficulties. Oh, one horrible element was the epidemics of typhus, which, you know, is worse than typhoid. Typhoid is also a dangerous, contagious disease, but typhus is something that exists only in Russia and, I believe, China and some oriental countries. And it's a disease of dirt. It's transmitted by lice. And it's very deadly. Most people die from it. In other words, the mortality is greater than the recovery, plus the fact that those who recover can have all kind of consequences for life, like weakened eyesight or all sorts of disabilities, and there's very little medical help for it. Well, anytime you went on a streetcar, you took a chance on your life in this respect, because you could see vermin on the people you are squeezed up against. Now, we used carnation oil and kerosene on your hair, which certainly smells awful, but that's protection. And in the middle of that... This was my entrance into youth you know, I was trying to be glamorous. It was not very easy. My last year in university, more theatres were opening, smaller ones. And I began to be able to go and see a few on the third, and fourth-run houses, in effect. And that fascinated me, particularly because that was a much more specific, not merely symbolic, View of life abroad. As that was the reason why for my last year in Russia and getting ready for hoping to come to America, I decided to go to that movie school to learn the technique of movies and production, generally. And the great advantage of going to that school was that they gave you free passes to all movie theatres, since they were all state. And then I began to see movies every night, practically. And that was the most wonderful period, so that those movie stars and movie magazines from abroad became, well, the world from Mars. And I remember, there was some American movies Where you could see New York, just shots, usually long shots, and I would sit through two shows just to catch it, because it would be very brief. They never had one that showed much. But you could get that glimpse once in a while. I can't tell you how glamorous it was at that distance. Well, it still is. So, after I graduated from school is when I got the job as a guide through a museum. And the museum was the Peter and Paul Fortress in Petrograd, Where I had to lecture on the history of the place for excursions. And I held that job until I left for America. It's about that period after graduation that we received letters from some relatives of Mother's, who... her first cousins, who had left before the revolution, long before I was born, actually. Mother had met them as a child, but I wouldn't have known them at all, and they were writing to inquire how we were and what was happening to us. And Mother began a correspondence, and that is when I and Mother both had the idea that perhaps they could help me to go abroad, because I was speaking of going abroad in one way or another. I was desperately anxious to go, so we wrote to these relatives that I would like to come as a visitor, and they sent me the affidavit, the papers necessary, and my main interest was getting ready for this trip, and studying English, which I didn't know at all. And I left for America then in January 1926. I left in 1926, alone. All right. Well, did you leave in fear, or do you have childhood memories of the...? - In fear of what? Of Russia? - Yeah. - In complete loathing. - Loathing? For the whole country, and including the tsarist period. Look, it's very hard to explain. It's almost impossible to convey to a free people what it's like to live in a totalitarian dictatorship. I can tell you a lot of details. I can never completely convince you, because you are free. And it's in a way good that you don't... You can't even conceive of what it's like. Certainly, they have friends and mothers-in-law. They try to live a human life, but you understand that it is totally inhuman? Now try to imagine what it's like if you are in constant terror from morning to night and at night you're waiting for a doorbell to ring, if you are afraid of everything and everybody, if you live in a country where human rights is nothing, less than nothing, and you know this. You don't know who, when, is going to do what to you because you may have friends somewhere, Where there is no law and no rights of any kind. It is the ugliest, and, incidentally, most mystical country on earth. They have a materialistic mysticism of their own. Because if... the mystics, the religious people, tell you that usually the soul is the only thing of value about you, the body is evil, and the Russians will think, "No, there isn't such a thing as a soul or a mind. There's only your body." It's materialism. They believe that you are not a man, but a collection of atoms. And give that body to the state for the collective effort of the... That's right. For the good of the whole and sacrifice to the state. And whoever says it is or wants to be the state. I arrived in New York. I stayed in New York only a couple days with some friends of my relatives, Whom they had asked to meet me, and then proceeded to Chicago. Stayed there for six months with my relatives, and then went on to Hollywood on my own. I borrowed money from the relatives, $100. I felt that I had to sell something or make a name for myself as fast as possible. I was here on a six months permit. Because I couldn't yet hope to write in a literary English, I had figured out that, since this was the day of the silent movies, I could write, even if it's slightly broken English, enough to write an outline, the scenario, just the original of a story, and then they could... Somebody else... Could write the titles. And one of my relatives, one of Mother's cousins, owned a movie theatre in Chicago, at small neighbourhood theatre. So she gave me, through a distributor, a letter of introduction from the distributor in Chicago to the DeMille Studio. DeMille, at that time, had an independent studio of his own in Culver City. What he was famous for is society, glamour, sex, and adventure. And I liked almost all of the ones that I had seen in Russia, so he was my particular idol of the American screen. When I arrived at the studio... And I went to the publicity department and presented that letter, and I told him what I was interested in was a junior screenwriter's job, if it was possible. I walk out of the studio, and, you know, it's the colonial kind of mansion in Culver City, which was Pathé later. And it has a driveway in front of the main building that goes to a gate. And as I start to walk down the driveway, I see an open roadster parked, and a man at the wheel talking to somebody outside the car. And it was DeMille. And it wasn't too long before he started driving. He drives up to the gate, stops, looks at me, and asks, "Why are you looking at me?" So I told him I had just come from Russia, and I'm very happy to see him. So he opens the door of the car and says, "Get in." I didn't know where we were going. I got in, and he started driving. Now, isn't that a fantastic story? And on the way I told him that I wanted to be a writer, and he was my favourite director. And my English was atrocious, as you can imagine. I'm not sure how much he understood, but he seemed very pleasant, sort of amused and interested. Where he was driving was the back lot. They were shooting "The King of Kings." And they were on location. What they called the back lot of the studio was some distance away in the hills. And they had the Jerusalem streets built there, and they were right in the middle of the picture. He told me on the way, as we were approaching the set, "Well, if you want to work in pictures, you should begin by watching how they work on the set, and by observing and learning. So this will do you good, you see." So he brings me on the set, and it's my first View of motion-picture shooting, and my actual first full day in Hollywood, the day after my arrival, and it was fantastic. I was so breathlessly numb and shocked that to this day, I can remember the feeling. During the rest of the day, I did nothing except watch the shooting. And at the end of it, he himself approached me. I didn't ask. He said, "Do you want to come tomorrow?" I said, "Certainly." So he gave me a pass, personally signed. And I went home literally dazed. And that was several days in succession that he gave me that pass, and I'd come and watch the shooting. Now, then, after the first week or so, he asked me what was I doing financially. So I told him, "I'm all right. I have enough. But I need work." He said, "Well, then, you can work as an extra." I had never thought of acting, but this was not... Wasn't really acting. And I give him credit for being sensitive. I think he understood. And, now, the extras, they had by that time, the big mob scenes where there was 300 people, and the lowest salary began at $7.50 a day. For me, it was really a fortune. When they called a very large set, a large crowd, you had to be at the studio by 6:00 in the morning. And there were no buses going to Culver City that early. So in order to get to the studio by 6:00, I had to take a streetcar when it was still dark to Los Angeles, and then a street car from Los Angeles that went to Culver City. It was the only form of transportation. It took something over two hours. It was on the streetcar out of Los Angeles, the one going from Los Angeles to Culver City, that I first saw Frank. I didn't see him enter, so he was sitting some benches further away, but facing me. And I remember I suddenly caught sight of this face, and that was it. I couldn't really say love, except that... at that stage, except that I was desperately overwhelmed. And then comes the Culver City stop, the studio stop, and he gets up and was getting off the streetcar. Well, that really delighted me. Then I saw him on the set, and he was magnificent. I later, from memory, drew a... A picture of him, which I still have somewhere, locked. And it's quite a resemblance. What I couldn't forget was the profile, the way he looked with that headdress. So I spent about three or four days staring at him on the set. And I was trying to figure out some way to meet him. I was watching him every minute. He was always sitting somewhere alone, and no matter what position he took, you know, he was graceful in any position. Then it was about the fourth or fifth day that I figured where I could do it, and it was in this big scene in the street of Jerusalem. That was the part of the picture Where Christ is carrying the cross on his way, you know, to the crucifixion. Well, I watched very carefully where he went, because being a bit player, he had special routines that had to be specific and repeated each time. So then I decided, "I'll get in his way." So the next take, after I had it all calculated, I got right in his way during that chaos, While they were shooting, and he stepped on my foot and apologised. The rest is history. The sad part was that he finished his work that day. And I thought that they might call him back, because you never could tell... For any takes or any continuity. So 11 days after, I waited, and he didn't come. Now, I knew his name, but I didn't know the address. And I didn't know how to find out. And because by then, I was in love, seriously. In fact, I knew I was in love from the time I saw him on the set. Now, what was happening in my career was, that when "The King of Kings" was over, DeMille offered me the job as a junior writer. Now, he really was wonderful. The first story he gave me was a story entitled "My Dog," and then another story was called "The Skyscraper." Because it was an original he had bought, and it involved a rivalry of two rough and tough construction workers who were in love with the same girl. And he told me that he didn't like the story very much, but he liked the idea of a story about the construction of a skyscraper. But it's because of that story that I found Frank again. There was a construction job going on right in Hollywood on... you know what is now the Broadway department store there on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard? And I made an appointment with the superintendents through somebody at the studio to come to interview him and watch the construction. When I got there, he had left a message that he had been detained somewhere, and could I please come an hour later? I didn't want to go back home, so I decided I would wait in the public library, which was just a block from there. And I entered the public library, and the first thing I see is Frank sitting there. And the thrilling thing was that I stopped dead, and he looked up. I was some distance away. And the way he smiled, I knew he recognised me immediately. And almost implicit in it, I kind of sensed he hadn't forgotten me. So he got up. And since you couldn't talk there, he said, "Let's go out," and we walked around blocks, and we talked. And this time, I remember, we talked about movie originals and what he wanted to do. He had some ideas for originals. They were all outrageous comedies. I mean, outrageous in the sense, almost blasphemous. Some were religious subjects or something like that. So right then, he invited me to dinner. And from then on, we were going steady. Now, how the question of a marriage came up, I believe that one day, Frank just talked about it. I didn't ask him to. And we were married on April 15, 1929. And it was just a proper, non-religious ceremony. The judge's chambers in the... You know, I think it's the Hall of Justice in Los Angeles, Where the... which they show very often in the "Dragnet" movies. Anyway, once I was checked in as the wife of a citizen, I felt security for the first time in years, at least politically. - You are married? - Yu. Your husband, is he an industrialist? No, he's an artist. His name is Frank O'Connor. - And he... not the writer? - He paints. - No, not the writer. - He paints. And does he live from his painting? He's just beginning to study painting. - I see. - He was a designer before. Is he supported in his efforts by the... by the state? Most certainly not. He's supported by you for the time being? No, by his own work, actually, in the past. By me if necessary, but that isn't quite necessary. And there is no... There is no contradiction here, in that... In that you help him? No, because you see, I am in love with him selfishly. It is to my own interest to help him if he ever needed it. I would not call that a sacrifice, because I take selfish pleasure in it. Now, after, I had to do something, and this was the Depression approaching, so that it was very, very difficult to find anything. And the only things that were available were waitresses' jobs. And so I tried that. And I didn't even know the names of the foods. So the first restaurant, I was fired the same day. The last one, I lasted a whole week. And then I did envelope-stuffing and tried to sell subscriptions to the Hollywood Citizen. I hated those jobs. I hated that whole period. I regarded it like "Rock in the Quarry," only much worse because Rock would at least be much more conscious of what he was doing and do it intentionally. I felt that this was despair and horror. It's at that time that a friend of ours, who was a... he... He was a Russian actor. He got me a job in the RKO wardrobe. A friend of his had just got the job of art director in charge of all those departments, and that's the only job where they could use someone who couldn't type or take shorthand. And I got this job at $20 a week. Within six months, I got $25. I got a raise, without having asked for it. And a year later, I was the head of the department. And I really did very well, loathing and hating it. But it was really a happy period, in every sense. Now, the RKO job, of course, solved everything, which is why, in spite of hating it, I was delighted to have it. To begin with, I had a steady income. And at that time, Frank was working fairly well, so we could take an apartment. And we took an apartment right across the street from RKO. It was our first home, and he decorated it, and it's the first time I saw his artistic ability. He did it really out of nothing. It was a furnished apartment, but he built extra shelves and framed pictures... Or the kind of little objects that he could always find in second-hand shops... And he did it beautifully. It looked much, much more than what it was. And then, through the RKO connections, I got a pull, in effect, with Central Casting, so that Frank was kept working almost steadily, which didn't mean every day, but certainly several days a week, and long jobs, you know, where he was on one set for days. And then we began to really breathe a little, and we bought our first car. It was a second-hand car, a convertible, and it was wonderful... a hash. We bought it on time, but we paid for it. And that was the period when Frank gave me my desk, which he had made to order, the one that's still there, and my first portable typewriter, which I have, and a radio. So the years in wardrobe were comparatively secure for us. And, you see, the Depression was the fall of that year. After that, when everybody was losing jobs, I worked all through the Depression, and that was fortunate, as during that period that I began to write. And it's in that period when I was at RKO that I began... I decided I was ready for my first novel. And it was partly, as I said, Frank's and his brothers' influence that made me decide on "We The Living," because they were telling me that I must do a novel on Russia and saying just what... All the things I had been saying in conversation about communism in Russia. The situation of "We The Living" is practically biographical... Autobiographical in the sense of background. I was taking chronologically the exact events as they were happening at that time. In the first year, when I first went to college, students were quite outspoken. And I attended my first student meeting, just as I describe in "We The Living," and almost fell in love with one of the young men who was a conservative and was making violent anti-soviet speeches, and I felt very romantically impressed with him for a single value. He was anonymously, arrogantly outspoken against the communists. And the first meeting that I attended, they were making the speech... He was making the speech which I quoted in "We The Living." That was an authentic one, that Russian students had always been in the vanguard of any fight against tyranny, no matter what colour. And statements like that, they were quite anti-communist. And in among the students, there was an official communist cell in the university, and the people who belonged to it wore a certain kind of red badges. And they were very much despised by the majority of the students. They were practically ostracised in a quietly hostile way, so that the atmosphere was quite free, just that first year. And I made quite a few very... Varying statements at those meetings. I wouldn't be allowed to make speeches yet. See, the freshmen, the first-year, was not allowed. We were allowed to vote. This was elections for student council. But you weren't allowed to make speeches or do anything until the second year. By allowed, I don't mean by law, but simply by student conventions. And then I started arguments with communists. And I remember one day telling one of them that they will all be hung from street lanterns someday, from lampposts, and then went home terrified. And that night, I really was afraid, because I realised that I had put my whole family in danger. By the end of that first year, there was a purge of students. They began to tighten. And that same young man, plus a lot of others, and girls who had gone out with them but weren't political in any sense, were all sent to Siberia. By the second year, there were no more political speeches. Why is it so... I'm still not quite sure Why you're so harsh on those who would sacrifice for other people. Because they are... They don't hesitate to sacrifice whole nations. Look at Russia. Communism is based on altruism. Look at Nazi Germany. The Nazis were more explicit than even the Russians in preaching self-sacrifice and altruism and self-sacrifice for the state, for the volk, the people. Every dictatorship is based on altruism. Now, you can't fight it by merely saying, "It's a difference of opinion." It's a difference of life and death. I also wrote two screen originals, both of them laid in Russia, and I sold one of them, which was "Red Pawn," to Universal Pictures. And along with the sale went a six-weeks job to write the first adaptation of it in screen form, because the original was just an eight-page synopsis. Now, on the proceeds of "Red Pawn," I wrote "Night of January 16th." MGM took an option on "Night of January 16th." It was called "Penthouse Legend." I wrote it as a stage play, and I had an agent in Hollywood who had a representative in New York. In the meantime, MGM became interested and took one of the producers, and they took an option on it, and I went to MGM to write a screen adaptation, which I had a miserable time with. And I wrote the screenplay, but they didn't like it, apparently, and they didn't pick up the option. But that gave us some more money. Then I finished "We The Living" and sent it off to New York, and I had a terrible time with it, because I began waiting for letters from the agents. I had asked them to report to me what happens. And it would be one rejection after another. Our main income by that time was Frank's... his work in pictures. I mean, I think by the time we landed in New York, we had $50 between us. Frank's brother was here, and so we had someone at least to borrow from a little. But not much, because he didn't have much himself. That's when we lived in the furnished room, and that was as near as we came to real starvation. It was much worse than Hollywood. It was already after 1929 and... And the Depression, you see. So the only thing I got was being a reader, not for Paramount, which came later, but for RKO, first, and then MGM. And I was doing outside reading. We lived... I remember our budget was approximately $11 a week, which was all I could count on. But my one advantage was I could read several languages... French, German, and Russian. I could read German enough to make a synopsis. And so they were giving me most of the foreign stuff. They even had some Soviet Russian plays that I synopsised for them, which nobody would ever buy. Now, nothing was happening on "We The Living" except rejections during that year. But the offer from Macmillan came when we were in Philadelphia on the try-out of "Night of January 16th." I got a letter from Ann Watkins saying that Macmillan wants to buy it. The first idea for "The Fountainhead" came while I was still on "We The Living." I don't remember the exact date specifically as the birth of "The Fountainhead" as such. And this was the question in my mind about the difference between me and one girl I knew in Hollywood in pictures. It was a girl whom we met. She happened to live in the same apartment building, and she worked at RKO. She seemed to be enormously ambitious. She was definitely a Hollywood climber. And a question I asked her is, can she tell me what is her goal in life? She said, "If nobody had an automobile, I would not want one. If some people have two automobiles, I want two automobiles." It was literally like one of those light bulbs going off in my mind, like a dramatic revelation, that I saw immediately the principal difference between me and this girl, and that was Roark and Keating. It was in the fall of 1935, after "January 16th" had opened, that I made my first notes for the novel, and I remember the date because my first notes I still have, and the date is marked on them. And then, of course, one of the first things I did was read Frank Lloyd Wright's biography. There were very few books except Frank Lloyd Wright's biography on the careers of architects... Practically none. And then while I was studying architecture generally, which was one line of work that the plot line consisted of now working out the theme in action. And it was really worked out theoretically. For instance, the characters of Wynand and Toohey were the next step. The procedure of my thought was that if we take the ideal man at the centre... That is really the peak of the story, that's Roark... Then, in relation to him, I show three other types in this way. Roark is the man who could be the ideal man and was. Wynand is the man who wasn't but could have been. Keating was the man who wasn't and didn't know it. Toohey is the man who was not the ideal man and knew it. That... that was the definition for myself as to why I take these four as the key figures. What I liked most was that, of any predominant group of the population, the majority of the letters, and all of them good, were from men in the armed services. This was during the war. And I remember letters from flyers, for instance, saying that after every mission, they would gather around a candle and read passages from "The Fountainhead." And others, an awful lot from young aviators... Another letter that said he would have felt much better if he thought that what this war is fought for is for the ideals of "The Fountainhead." And all those letters coming from overseas. I answered as many as I could of those. They were the best. And so, this telephone call came and said they were interested in the movie rights to "Fountainhead." And they want to know What price I would take. I said, "$50,000." They said, "I want to warn you that you are running the risk of losing the sale." I said, "I'll take that chance." And then there was... There was a delay of I think a week or 10 days. In the meantime, I had an appointment with some businessman to meet him for lunch to discuss my idea of the conservative campaign for the book. I come back home, and the moment I open the door, Frank is standing somewhere in the middle of the living room, and I knew something had happened. There was an abnormal look on his face... a benevolent one. He said, "Well, darling, you've earned $50,000 while you were out to lunch," meaning that Warner Bros. Had accepted it. And they made only one condition, that I come to Hollywood to adapt it... They'll pay the transportation... And that I give them four weeks free, included in the price. What I remember, immediately after this telephone call, Frank and I go out to dinner. And usually, you see, if I was busy in the afternoon, I had no time to cook. We ate in a little cafeteria. It was a pretty bad place to eat, but very convenient when we couldn't cook. So we go out to dinner, and we both had the same experience. We always, you know, selected food by the right-hand side of the menu, by the price. And I think there were two types of dinners... 65 cents and 45. We always ate the 45 dinner. And it comes that we both, after we compared notes, started looking at the 45-cent dinner and suddenly remembered we can have the 65. This made the most... The... the issue of wealth, that made it realer than anything else, that fact that we suddenly could order a 65-cent dinner if we wanted to, and it was a marvellous feeling. And then that night, I couldn't sleep, of course. I sat at my desk, just gloating, and I had a small light so that Frank could sleep. And I'd hear him turning and twisting, and I finally asked him... It was hours in the middle of the night... I said, "Frank, what's the matter? You can't sleep, either? Are you gloating, too?" He said, "Yes, I'm afflicted, too." What was also very thrilling was our going to Hollywood by train. I remember, I had only gone there once before on a day coach. We had come back to New York by car, which had broken down. So we were on the bottom of the travelling list. The next step is we go to Hollywood in top luxury because Warner Bros. Was providing the tickets and everything. And the transition to this way of life was incredible. That whole trip, to this day, we both remember it as an enormous highlight, because, again, it was dramatically sudden. It was the feeling that we can that was marvellous. The only advantage of poverty is if you can get the contrast that way and also to know that we had earned it. This was marvellous. I remember the time when I was working on "The Fountainhead" at Warner Bros. An Associated Press man interviewed me. He was not assigned to Hollywood, you see. And he interviewed me on the Warner Bros. Lot, and he questioned me about my new novel, on which I was then working, and he wanted to know the theme. I didn't state the whole theme. But I told him just the background... It would be railroads and heavy industry. And I said to him, "The novel will combine metaphysics, morality, politics, economics, and sex." I started writing on September 2,1946. And the reason why I used the date September 2nd was simply because that was the day on which I started writing. And since it's the same time of the year in the story, I thought it's a convenient private joke or private symbolism. "Atlas" was the one central integrating purpose of everything I did. The first step was to project in a generalised way a kind of philosophical progression of what would be needed, What kind of men or characters would be needed to carry a story of that kind. Galt and Dagny were the two set almost immediately. Dagny was always the type that I intended to present someday as my ideal woman, or as the feminine Roark, in effect, to do in my metaphysics What Roark did. And for this type of story, a woman engineer would be just ideal. The difficulty with Galt's speech was that I knew in advance it would have to be along speech, summing up the essentials of all the issues in the novel. However, I had no idea what a difficult job it would be. I knew that this is going to be the hardest chapter in the whole book, and that the climax will be passed when I finished that speech. And do you know, the underestimation of my whole life was that I thought... Well, somewhat dreamt that it would take at least three months. But, you know, it took two years. It was after I had finished Galt's speech that I decided to start submitting it to publishers. And, you see, I had a contract with Bobbs-Merrill for "The Fountainhead" which included an option on my next two novels, on terms to be agreed upon. And Alan Collins had told me that it's a mere formality. I have to submit it, and then we will not agree on terms. He did not think they would give me the kind of terms that we thought we would ask from other publishers. And I explained to Random House boys just what my problem was as they opened, and it's then that Bennett Cerf came up with a brilliant idea... A philosophical contest. He said, "Why don't we select four or five publishers Whom we are most interested in, and submit the book simultaneously?" And it wouldn't be an issue of bidding for conditions, that I would ask the publishers to read it and to tell me what their attitude would be philosophically and ideologically. I was very startled by Donald Klopfer's philosophical acuteness when he asked me the following question. He said, "But if this is an uncompromising defence of capitalism, wouldn't you have to clash with the Judeo-Christian tradition of ethics?" And that was the second that just got him the book. And what's wrong with loving your fellow man? Christ, every important moral leader in man's history, has taught us that we should love one another. Why, then, is this kind of love, in your mind, immoral? It is immoral if it is a love placed above one's self. It is more... more than immoral. It's impossible. Because when you are asked to love everybody indiscriminately, that is to love people Without any standard, to love them regardless of the fact of whether they have any value or virtue, you are asked to love nobody. But in a sense, in your book, you talk about love as if it were a business deal of some kind. Isn't the essence of love that it is above... Above self-interest? Well, let me make it concrete for you... What would it mean to have love above self-interest? It would mean, for instance, that a husband would tell his wife, if he were moral, according to the conventional morality, that, "I am marrying you just for your own sake. I have no personal interest in it, but I am so unselfish that I am marrying you only for your own good." Well, should husbands and wives...? Would any woman like that? Should husbands and wives, Ayn, tally up at the end of the day and say, "Well, now, wait a minute. I love her if she's done enough for me today, or she loves me if... if I have properly performed my functions"? Oh, no, you misunderstood me. That is not how love should be treated. I agree with you that it should be treated like a business deal, but every business has to have its own terms and its own kind of currency. And in love, the currency is virtue. You love people not for what you do to... for them or what they do for you. You love them for their values, the virtues which they have achieved in their own character. You don't love causelessly. You don't love everybody indiscriminately. You love only those who deserve it. And that is one of the main points I'm presenting... new morality, a moral defence of capitalism, without which it can't be defended, because it does clash. How was writing novels difficult for you? Because it's an enormous context that you have to keep in mind, an enormous structure. You can't do it inspirationally. You can't do it by just looking at the big piece of paper once and deciding what you're going to do. It's a whole enormous structure, much more complicated than a building. And you have to keep it all in your mind, never contradict your outline, and carry it out. It's killingly difficult, but wonderful when you've succeeded. My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute. Do you consider yourself primarily a novelist or primarily a philosopher? I would say I'm primarily both. Finally. And for the same reasons. You see, my main interest and purpose both in literature and in philosophy is to define and present the image of an ideal man, the specific, concrete image of What man can be and ought to be. And when I started writing, when I approached the task of literature and began to study philosophy, I discovered that I was in profound disagreement with all the existing philosophies, particularly the code of morality. Therefore, I had to do my own thinking. I had to define my own full philosophical system in order to discover and present the kind of ideas and premises that make an ideal man possible. At the sales conference at Random House preceding the publication of "Atlas Shrugged," one of the book salesmen asked me whether I could present the essence of my philosophy While standing on one foot. I did, as follows. Objective reality. Reason. Self-interest. Capitalism. If you want this translated into simple language, it would read, "Nature to be commanded, not be obeyed," or, "Wishing won't make it so. You can't eat your cake and have it, too. Man is an end in himself. Give me liberty, or give me death." If you held this concept with total consistency as the base of your convictions, you would have a full philosophical system to guide the course of your life. But to hold them with total consistency, to understand, to define, to prove, and to apply them requires volumes of thought, which is why philosophy cannot be discussed While standing on one foot, nor while standing on two feet on both sides of every fence. This last is the predominant philosophical position today, particularly in the field of politics. My philosophy, objectivism, holds that reality exists as an objective absolute. Facts are facts independent of man's feelings, Wishes, hopes, or fears. I would like to think that there is something beyond the end of this thing we call life. But tell me... supposing you were convinced that there isn't. What difference would it make to you now? Oh, it would make a tremendous difference to me. Yeah, I think so. But I think for the better. Well, you see, I think for the worse. I wouldn't... I wouldn't like to believe that when this body dies, that this spirit is all... is now gone, that it's... it's... it's defeated. It's not... not defeated. Think of it the other way. If you know that this life is all that you have, wouldn't you make the most of it? Reason, the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses, is man's only means of perceiving reality, his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival. Why can't I be a reasonable philosopher walking around, wondering what it's all about, struggling, striving, trying to understand, enjoying the quest and the journey, and... and then in the last... The last little part of my consciousness, I say, "I know you're there somewhere. I don't understand why you did it this way, but I certainly can't wait to die and find out"? Do you appreciate the question? Do you understand? Why are those two things not possible? Yes, you've said it, I think, unintentionally. You said, "So I can't wait to die and find out." That... I am serious... Is one of the results of acting on faith. You can't wait to get out of this life. And there... what's wrong with that? Because this life is wonderful, as you said. Because if you look at the universe, it's wonderful. And you have to use your life to the best of your understanding. If you go by emotions, not reason, it means you're going against reality. Something exists, something is right, and you say, "No, I don't like it, because I want to believe something else." I see. You, in effect, go by emotions, by your whims, not by reason. And religion or the God concept or faith or worship has people... Has people thinking of life as a veil of tears... That's right. Through which you will probably not get without falling. You are essentially an evil person who is bent toward... Well, most religions do preach just that. And you don't believe that? God, no. I hold that if man wants to live on Earth and to live as a human being, that his highest moral purpose is the achievement of his own happiness, and that he must not force other people nor accept their right to force him, that each man must live as an end in himself and follow his own rational self-interest. What... so what's bad about the person who wants to help other people? Well, to begin with, that's the big mistake. People can want to help other people, properly, and with very good reasons, but that isn't altruism. Altruism doesn't mean merely helping people. It means sacrificing yourself for others. Placing the interests of others above your own, is the self-sacrificing person who is an altruist. And what's wrong with that? Well, what's wrong with committing suicide? What's wrong with giving up life, and why is the happiness of another person important and good, but not your own? Why are you always the outsider and the sacrificial animal? For a good relationship, there should be no victims. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects man's rights. It uses physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. And you believe that there should be no right by the government to tax? You believe that there should be no such thing as welfare legislation, unemployment compensation, regulation during times of stress, certain kinds of rent controls and things like that? That's right. I'm opposed to all forms of control. I am for an absolute laissez-faire, free, unregulated economy. Let me put it briefly. I am for the separation of state and economics. Just as we had separation of state and church, which led to peaceful coexistence among different religions after a period of religious wars, so the same applies to economics. If you separate the government from economics, if you do not regulate production and trade, you will have peaceful cooperation and harmony and justice among men. Capitalism was the system originated in the United States. Its success, its progress, its achievements are unprecedented in human history. America's political philosophy was based on man's right to his own life, to his own liberty, to the pursuit of his own happiness, which means a man's right to exist for his own sake. That was America's implicit moral code, but it had not been formulated explicitly. This was the flaw in her intellectual armour, which is now destroying her. The trouble with this country is that it was based on the right philosophy originally, by the Founding Fathers, but they did not have a moral code to match the... the political ideas which they had. You love this country, don't you? - Passionately. - Yeah. Very, very much. And consciously. I love it for its ideas. And I've seen enough of the other side, so I can appreciate this country. You might even get emotional about this country, huh? Oh. Oh, yes. Why? You want me to get emotional? You might even thank God for it, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah. I may not literally mean a God, but I like what that expression means. "Thank God" or "God bless you." It means the highest possible, to me. And I would certainly thank God for this country. What I've always thought was a sentence from some Greek philosopher... I don't, unfortunately, remember who it was. I got it at 16, and it's affected me all my life. "I will not die. It's the world that will end." And that's absolutely true. And, you know, for me now, it should be a serious question, because my time is fairly limited, and I have the same feeling... That I will enjoy life to the last moment. And when it's the end, I don't have to worry about it. I'm not sad. It's too bad that the world will end, and I think a very wonderful world will end with me. But I've had my time. I can't complain. And at the conclusion, I will say it's a very benevolent universe, and I love it, and any struggles were worth it, and how. And I don't regret a minute of it. What I mean is that the struggle, all of the unhappiness is enormously unimportant. But the positive is wonderful. And if it's the last interview of my life, I would... I hope I will... I know I will be saying it at 80. It's a benevolent universe.
