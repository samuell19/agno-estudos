Look what you've done! I'm soaking wet. I'm not drunk. You're trying to make me drunk. Okay... Get up. Don't make a scene. Get up. Go away! Thank you. Let's eat. It was a long haul train journey. Come on. LEONARD HO, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER They're the notorious Japanese monks. The place is full. Please wait outside. The place is full. Please wait outside. What are you doing? Dad! Let her go! I've told you not to let your daughter help in the shop. Those Japanese monks are bastards. Don't cry. Go up first. Get your tickets over there! Get your tickets over there! We're new here. Stay alert. Mr. Shirakawa. Thanks a lot. Who would have guessed? A Japanese man has paid us to kill Japanese monks. Let's get a drink. Bye! Excuse me, sir. Are you waiting for someone, Sir? We only serve members and foreign guests here. Are you one? "I steal a moment in your extraordinary youth" "And immerse you in songs" "I spray on the tempting scent of champagne" "And stand in the spotlight" "Lost in the smoke..." How's your mission going, Mr. Shirakawa? "Come on, let's get drunk" With the Emperor's blessings, nothing can go wrong! If you need our help, just let us know. Let's drink to our friendship! Yes! Drink to our friendship! Jing, don't come if you're unwell. Take a shower and get changed. Wait for me upstairs. "I'm whispering in your ear" "I want to enchant you" "Fill your glass With my passion tonight" "I steal a moment in your extraordinary youth" "And immerse you in songs" "I spray on the tempting scent of champagne" "And stand in the spotlight" "Lost in the smoke Shielding red and embracing green" "Come on, let's get drunk, get drunk" "immerse yourself in pleasure" "Tonight, I'll see you in my dream" "We'll be together briefly" "Until tomorrow comes" Mr. Yuk, you're leaving so soon? Mr. Ng, I'm here in the hope of listening to your daughter sing. Now I've realized my hope. Let me introduce a friend to you. This is Captain Noguchi from the Japanese Embassy. Hello. Mr. Ng, even you are getting in touch with the Japanese. It's good to make new friends. Not for me. I've got enough friends. Let's talk again. Goodbye. CHUA LAM, PRODUCER Mui yi, I want you to sing a Japanese song to cheer up the Japanese here. Sorry, I don't know Japanese. Just sing after me. I hate feeling snubbed. Me too. Excuse me. Get lost! Be careful! We're on a mission. Don't draw attention to yourself. I was off the mark. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Would you help me if I'm not? You won't fight your own people in front of the Chinese. Do you really think so? I'm not really angry. I still have to apologize to you. I just wanted to let you know... It's fine now. Don't go back to the club tonight. Let's have a bite after Mui yi has changed her clothes. Who was behind the murder of the Japanese monks? Tit Chak man? Sum! Let's check inside. Okay. Mr. Tit. What happened? Am I here to answer your question? What's the matter? Shut up! Mr. Ng, a Japanese man died. This is serious. If we can't find the murderer tonight, everyone here will be held responsible. No one can leave! Stay where you are. Jing, call David. No one can leave! What did you see? Nothing. This has nothing to do with me. Search! Yes. Hold on. Search here? Do you know where you are? Mr. Ng, a Japanese man died. Can you bear the consequences? He was just a stooge. This is the International Settlement. It's not ceded to the Japanese. Feel free to take the body, but wait for the police to search. Who do you think you are? How dare you stop me! I'm from the Japanese Embassy. Mr. Noguchi, I didn't know you're here. I'm a secret agent. I work for Mr. Wang in Nanking. You're not even Japanese. Why make a fuss? Leave this to the people of their settlement. I'll inform the Municipal Council tomorrow to arrange for an investigation. Can Mr. Tit and your friends leave now? What if the murderer is still here? David! David. Mr. Ng. Here. Put down all your pistols. What did you say? I didn't hear you. Come here. They've arrived. Confiscate all their pistols. Stand aside. Put down your pistols. Go. Stand still. Put down your pistols. Don't draw your pistol casually. David, a Japanese man died here. It was just one. Five died outside tonight. Get out of the way! Get lost! This isn't a circus. I'm to help investigate the murder here tonight. It's none of your business. Get lost! Get more guards to station here. Don't fall asleep. Expecting something? I won't need you if I know. Do you have to leave now? Yes. I have to write a report about this incident. Don't panic, okay? Hold him. Put him down. Mui yi... He'll be fine after throwing up. You can wipe off the blood for him. Is he your friend? Please don't tell my dad. Fine. He can't help with the issue anyway. It'll just worry him. But you can't just let him stay here. Wait until he's better. Wrap his wounds first. We'll think of a way tomorrow. Auntie Jing, thank you. "WAKE UP, COMRADES" Be united and fight Japan! Be united and fight Japan! Be united and fight Japan! Be united and fight Japan! Be united and fight Japan! Be united and fight Japan! Go die! Be united and fight Japan! Give these to them. Be quick! Calm down! Please calm down! Don't give them an excuse to repress you. No! No! Don't throw stones at them. No! Fight Japan! Don't stay here. Go now! Hurry up, go! Hurry up, go! Hurry! Retreat, everyone! Hurry up! Don't stay here. Go! Just go! The police are here. The Emperor liked to admire the green willows along the embankment. He slept and woke up three times each day. It was spring. The swallows were flying around. The willows were swaying in the wind. He couldn't help loving it. "FIGHT ENEMIES UNITEDLY" Do you like it? I can only give you this. Don't lose it. I won't. Never. It's 11:00 p.m., and a young man is looking for you. I've told him to wait downstairs. Hello. Hello. Mui yi, forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye. I'm left with no choice. The situation is ever changing. I only know that the country needs me. I know I'm being unfair to you. I can only blame myself. I've chosen to love you... at a time when I can least afford it. Therefore, I can't promise you anything at the moment. Love, Sum. Invader, go away! Invader, go away! Go away! Go now! What are you doing? Go away! Back off! Apart from your care for the country, don't you feel for anything else? I don't care how bad the war is. I still have feelings. You can't act like this. Leave me alone, please. I want it. I have the right to. Don't force yourself if you can't. "JAPANESE EMBASSY PROTESTS" "AGAINST KILLING OF MONKS" "AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE" Let him in. Shirakawa's death at the club last night might not be a coincidence. I'll authorize the secret agents to investigate. Don't interfere in this matter. Tell me, did we plot the monks' murder? This is national affairs. Just pretend that you suspect nothing. How are you feeling? Eat it while it's still warm. Mui yi, last time I was... Enough said. You've told me everything. Don't repeat the words in your letter. I still remember them. I don't want to listen to you. Don't be like this. I know last time... That was years ago! I've accepted it as a fact. I'll wash these for you. No need. I... I have to leave soon. Okay. Go then. But the secret agents are watching. Mui yi... please thank Mrs. Ng for her help. Good evening, Mr. Noguchi. How long will you stay in Shanghai? I don't know. Everything is fast changing at the moment. I'm sorry. Stop apologizing for your own decisions. This is yours. Take it back. I'm not taking back my feelings for you. At a time like this, I can't tell what it'll be like tomorrow. So I can't and I shouldn't promise you anything. But please trust me. When the war is over, no matter where you are and what you've become, I'll come find you. I... Sum! Sum! Sum! Sum! Sum! Can I take the words you said just now seriously? Yes. Newspaper! Newspaper! Thank you. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Good morning. You've made yourselves dirty again. One, two, three, four... Time for school. Get ready. Good morning. Let's go. One, two... Mister, Mister, where are you from? I've never seen you before. Who are you looking for? Is the food ready? Please don't cry. What's wrong again? Long. Brother Leung! It's you! Brother Leung, where have you been? Are you injured? Yes. Have our men been settled in? How are they? They're fine. Where are they? Many of them are upstairs. After that Japanese man died, the secret agents searched everywhere. Bring the food up. They must be hungry. Okay. Take cover! Take cover! Take cover! Kid, no! Drop the parcel! Kid, come down! Kid, don't! Kid, don't! Drop the parcel! Come down! This is for you. Drop the parcel! Kid! Come down! Don't just leave like this. "Let me ask you" "Is our love destined" Back off! "Are we destined to meet each other" "And retain this love of ours" Over there! Follow him! "Is this my debt for not giving my love" "Or is this destiny" "Our entanglements are of our own making" Drinks on the house again? Look at these girls! There's nothing wrong. Mr. Noguchi. "Who would have thought once we meet" This is the seizure order of the club. JESSE'S "We are no longer unruffled" Let's talk inside. "On a day when the night wind is blowing" "Or when the rain is falling" "I'll meet the debt of my life" What do you want? Move over. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm secret agent Tit Chak man. I trust you already know that the Japanese army has stationed in the International Settlement... to contribute to the co prosperity of Greater East Asia. We're happy to take over this place on their behalf. I'm Chinese, but we need a stronger China. To achieve this, we need the help of our Japanese friends. That's why I respect the Japanese. Whoever doesn't respect them, doesn't respect me! I suspect that people from the resistance hid here before. That's why I have to search here. Your dad hid the resistance gang and helped murder Shirakawa. What did you just say? Mr. Tit, we've found this in the garage. There are so many people here each night. Anyone could have left this behind. Who can tell if this belongs to someone from the resistance? You're not Chinese. You're a Japanese stooge. Don't blame Mui yi. She's still young. Tit Chak man, you stooge, since when are you in charge of the club? Since today. Times have changed, Mr. Ng. Your American passport can no longer protect you. Ding Fung, take him away! Dad! Take him back. Yes. Go. Tit Chak man! Mr. Noguchi, I've got the consensus of General Kawashima. Please cooperate. Go away! Dad! Don't go with them. Don't... I'm going with them. I'm in trouble this time. Jing, help me take care of this club. Mui yi, I'll be fine. Take him! Go! Don't touch me. I can walk by myself. Dad! Drive off. Yes, Sir. "NEWSPAPER AGENCY" "XINWEN NEWSPAPER" It's seldom so quiet here. How can I help you? My team needs a new headquarters. I like it here, so we'll take over for now. We haven't been notified by the Japanese government. I'm notifying you on behalf of them. Your dad hasn't objected. So get smart! Mr. Tit, you're a real man. Real men don't bully women. I'll get acquainted with the premises. Don't go upstairs. Miss Ng, General Kawashima knows that you sing well. The imperial Radio would like to foster the relationship between Japan and China. We're here to request you to sing on the radio for the prosperity and stability of the new Shanghai. As soon as the Japanese army has left, Shanghai will be stable and prosperous again. Honorable colleagues. Miss Ng, please show loyalty to the Emperor. Please accept this letter of invitation. We'll arrange a car to pick you up. Goodbye. I think of you every night... but you are just not around. Where are you, Sum? I might have caught a cold last night. I was not feeling well this morning. It seems really chilly outside. You've left your coat with me. Do you have enough clothes to stay warm? What are you doing now? I went to visit Dad in prison with Aunt Jing this afternoon. He looked terrible. I'm worried about him. Where are you, Sum? Dear audience, I'm Ho Wing sum. After listening to the wonderful songs I've selected for you, I'd like to remind you of an upcoming event. Tomorrow noon on New Chapei Street, there'll be a live broadcast celebrating the anniversary of Greater East Asia. The Chinese government wants us to ruin the show. We've invited a special guest to perform at the show. Please stay tuned. You're also invited to come to the venue. Thank you. This is imperial Radio for East Asian Army. They're manipulating the media. We'll disrupt it. Testing, testing. Hello to everyone here and to the audience at home. This special gala show will soon begin. Let us first welcome General Kawashima... to deliver the opening speech. General Kawashima, please. I wish to thank all the guests here today, in particular Miss Ng Mui yi. Go away. It's dangerous! Their support to the imperial Army... Leave this place! Don't let them go! We must get them. Come on! Let's go! Back off! Move over, kids! Put down your pistols. Yes. Are you out of your mind? How can you shoot when there are so many people? Don't shoot! No, no! Breaking news! Latest news! Live broadcast! Three people from the resistance have been arrested by secret agents. Breaking news! Live broadcast! Kid, kid! Three resistance members arrested! Give me one! Get the breaking news! Kid, I want one. Get the breaking news! Kid! Get the breaking news! Sum, you've recovered! Have you read my letters? Why did you work for the Japanese? What's your reason? Have you been home? Answer me first. They've imprisoned my dad. He was always not strong. He is suspected of murdering Mr. Shirakawa. He still doesn't know what's going on. He's now... It's all my fault, Mui yi. It has nothing to do with you. I'm sorry. Tell me, Sum, do you truly love me? I don't want you to be exploited by the Japanese. Do you really love me? During such hardship, we shouldn't... Enough said. Here. They say one's tummy feels warmer when one is pregnant, doesn't it? Mui yi, I... I don't want to be unfair to our kid. Unfair? What about me? What about us? I don't know. I don't know. I need time to think it over. Mui yi, I hope you will understand that... I cannot lose you whatsoever. I have thought things through. I will soon arrange for you to leave Shanghai... and move to Chongqing or Chengdu. Run! Search the place. Yes. Move over! Shenyang, Beijing, Shanghai... Agent Tit reports to General Kawashima. Come over. Take a photo in front of the dead bodies together. "ON AIR" Let me take you home. Goodbye. Goodbye. See you. Thanks. Is my dad alright? I've arranged a military doctor to see him. Mui yi, the friend you helped with his getaway... has passed away. Sum... I saw him last night. I slapped him on his face. No. He's already left Shanghai. The secret agents stormed their hideout this morning. None of them survived. Mui yi, I came to tell you because I don't want you to find this out from the papers. I know how you feel for him. Mui yi! Mui yi! Although I cannot be with you till the war of resistance is won, I will miss you and our kid. I will go on living so that we can meet one day. I need this hope. Let me go home. Don't let me stay here alone. What's your plan for the future? The letter you gave me contains Sum's last words. No matter what the future holds, I'll keep this baby for him. I'm sorry. I just can't, and I don't want to forget him. I know. What's the matter? I'm looking for Mr. Tit. Mr. Tit is busy. Get out of my way! Let me take you upstairs. I don't care what you do outside. This is my dad's place. No one can come in except for family! I'll never come back then. Mui yi. I was worried that you wouldn't come. Why? I promised to take care of you. Nothing will change that. Yes. Miss Matsuda. Is General Kawashima here? He's in the restroom. Is it something urgent? Yes. I have to ask for his permission. I plan to get married soon. With Mui yi? Yes. Congratulations. Best wishes for you both. Thank you. A present for your bride. Matsuda, I need to speak to you. Yes. Have all the newspapers in Shanghai report the wedding of Noguchi and Mui yi on their front pages. This can promote Sino Japanese friendship. "WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT OF NG MUl YI AND NOGUCHI SYUUHIKO" Newspaper! There's no point going out. What can you do? Why are you heading this way, Mui yi? Do we really have to leave Shanghai tomorrow? Yes. Even if you stay, you can't take care of her. "Cold wind carries snowflakes Together with my song" "Into the white, empty night And they melt in my heart" "Many memories return together with The image of you that time" "On which day" "Will you come back to me" "On which day" "Will you kiss away my tears of sorrow" "And renew our vows with your sweetness" "When can we get drunk together again" "Thousands of snowflakes swirl in the sky According to my thoughts" "On a lonely night, I ask myself softly" "Who can tell me If the scene can take place once more" "On which day" "Will you come back to me" "On which day" "Can I be with you once more" "If we can ever see each other again We will be in a daze" "Savoring our love and obsession together" "if we can ever see each other again" "We will be in a daze" "Savoring our love" "And obsession together" So long as I'm in charge of public security, I won't tolerate this. A group of resistance members is coming to Shanghai. I've identified their local contact. Tomorrow I'll speak to General Kawashima to get his approval for an all out search. We expect backup from the Ministry of Public Security. "NAME LIST OF RESISTANCE MEMBERS" Go away. No new orders from the resistance headquarters yet. We must be patient. Evacuate the people upstairs. Something is going to happen. Leave immediately! Tit Chak man! Move over! It's a dead end. Fight them to death! Come out! Make way! Mr. Tit, take this! Go! Go, Brother Leung! Go! Mr. Tit, are you okay? Don't move. You're alive! Just a moment. Mui yi and I thought you were dead. Our marriage was a front... to ensure her safety. She's about to deliver in the hospital. For the sake of your own kid, go see her soon. "TIT CHAK MAN, KAWASHIMA, NG MUl YI, NOGUCHl" "LEUNG SUM TEMPORARY PASS" "SHANGHAI HEADQUARTERS" "SHANGHAI HEADQUARTERS" "NG MUl YI TEMPORARY PASS" Listen. Go over there. Take these. Leave the war zone once Mui yi has given birth. You can kill me. You can go on with your resistance. But Japan will still occupy China and the whole Asia. I didn't come for your lecture. If you really care about Mui yi... and her safety, go back to Japan with her at once. I don't get it. I don't have time to explain. Just do as I told you, or I'll shoot you. Even if I agree, Mui yi won't go with me. She only cares about you. Don't you understand? She's having a baby with you. Leave with Mui yi as a retired soldier. I'm telling you, both you... and Mui yi are our targets of assassination! Others will kill you even though I can't. She's too tense. Get ready for surgery. Give her the medication. Prepare for anesthesia. Relax. Sum, don't leave me. Relax. Sum, where are you? I can't live without you. Relax. Don't stress out. Count with me. One, two, three... Kid, you're on your own now. Four... On your own... five, six. Are you okay? I was worried about you and the baby. What happened? I only knew you were hurt, but the doctors wouldn't let me leave the ward. I didn't know if your condition was serious. Is the baby healthy? He was weak at birth, less than five pounds. But now he's full of life. He cries loudly and... is always hungry. Does he look like you or his father? Not like his father. No. "FOOKMAN HOSPITAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE" "NG KENTA" If you agree, I can obtain Japanese nationality for him. He can then leave this war ridden China anytime. He'll adopt your family name. Since finding out he's still alive, he's never come for me. He knew about the baby, but he didn't get in touch. I won't wait for him. "NOGUCHI KENTA" Let's leave this place together. "SOUVENIRS" Get up! Brother Leung! Calm down. Don't make a scene or we'll spoil the plan. Hold your temper, Brother Leung. Calm down. I really hate this war. You'll forget after leaving this place. For the last time, where's Leung Sum? He's the one the Japanese want, not you. That means I don't need to kill any of you! If you can't find Leung Sum today, the secret agents in Shanghai will have a new captain. Is that clear? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! You forced me to do this! You're all mad! Mad! Turn them over to the Japanese. The Japanese can do whatever they want. Long live China! Long gone Japan! Tit Chak man is there! Mr. Tit, leave before it's too late. We've got him! Kill him! Kill him! Great! Kill him! Kill his woman too! Kill that woman! Let's go. You're lucky this time. Traitor's wife! Go! Mrs. Ng. Please help me draw the curtains. It's too bright. I can't sleep. I often wonder, on the night you killed Kawashima, why didn't you kill us as well? If you did, at least I could die with him. We wouldn't live such pitiful lives all these years. Our ending wouldn't be like this. Don't be sad. The war's over now. Life would be a bit better. But it's not safe for you to be here alone. Come on, get on the train. Go find Mui yi in Japan. I know her well. The night we saved you in the garage, I could tell she loved you deeply. Help me give these to her. Don't wait, and don't let her wait. Go find her. Sir, do you want a shoe shine? It'll be quick. Go outside to find business. Go over there. Miss Yokoi, show him where Mr. Noguchi is. He's inside. Where's Dad? Isn't Asai a shy girl? No. Good boy. Dad! Kenta, come over here, Kenta. Dad! Kenta! Kenta! Dad! Come to Dad! Dad! I want Dad's peas. Don't eat too much. Who's that man? Why doesn't he smile? Be good. Eat your meal. What now? He looks really mean! What did he say? He wants to know who you are. Perhaps it was unfair for me to shoot you and leave you crippled. I'll always owe you one. I'm here to take Mui yi and my son back. Do you deserve them? What have you done for them? Have you ever taken care of your son? Have you ever taken care of Mui yi? What did you do for them during the 10 months in 1942? Were you with your son when he was crying? Let's go back to your room now. I wasn't like you. I had no choice. You didn't need to protect your homeland. You could decide on your own... whether to fight or to love. I didn't have the chance. I never had. Does that mean I can't have it for once? Shouldn't I be given the chance now? Tell me, do I really not deserve this chance? It's too late now. You had your chance, but it's gone now. I don't know the pain of having no one to protect the country. I just know... my pain of waiting for you in Shanghai. When the Pacific War broke out, all the people around me... suddenly vanished. I was left alone. Where were you at that time? Eight months and seven days. The more the baby grew inside me, the more I needed you beside me. But I couldn't find you. The baby was finally born. Oh what pain! He seemed to know his dad wouldn't be around. He would rather stay inside me. Did you know what happened? I called your name. I thought of you. I hoped you'd show up. I hoped you'd come back. Where were you at that time? They had to perform a surgery... to pull the baby out. After that, I was scared, really scared. I was worried. I was worried about the baby. If I had lost him, I'd have been all by myself. Eight months... and four years have passed. Do you know how I've lived through this? Have you ever thought about... all the time you left me by myself, how did I live through? Mum, don't cry. You don't have any rights. Promise me, you'll forget your past. I wanted to. But can I? Why didn't you tell me that... Sum shot your leg? Now that I know, I feel I owe you even more. Had I known it earlier, maybe I could have forgotten him. I didn't tell you because... I was afraid you'd ask why he shot me. I was afraid you'd leave me once you knew. He did that because... he wanted me to leave Shanghai with you as a retired soldier. We were targets of assassination then. For the safety of you and your baby, Sum didn't go to see you. He was worried that once you saw him, you wouldn't leave with me whatsoever. Now that I've told you, I'm worried that you'll take Kenta with you and leave me. Mui yi, please don't go. Please don't leave me. You and Kenta belong to me. Over the years, I did everything for both of you. Please don't leave me. I'm not as strong as Sum. I can't lose you both. I beg you, Mui yi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. A lady has left this letter for you. Mui yi! Mui yi! When the war is over, no matter where you are and what you've become, I'll come find you. "MATSUSHIROYA" "TSUMAGO HOTEL" Sum, the past is indeed the past. I've never regretted it once. Kenta woke up at midnight just now. He asked me who you are again. He seemed to have a feel. Forgive me, I can't tell him now you're his father. I'll tell him one day. Sum, promise me you won't come find me again. I can no longer stop myself from leaving with you.
