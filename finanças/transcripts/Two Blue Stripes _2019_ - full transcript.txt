Who got a 100? These two have a bright future. Nisa, Dara, nice. 90-ish? Come on, just a bit more. 80-ish? Your grades are going down. 70-ish? Come on, 70-ish? Vini, you promised me you'll improve your grades. 60-ish? Did you study seriously? Huh? 50-ish? Do you intend to ruin your own future? 40-ish? 40-ish? Once again, Bima. Just give up, Bima. You have no future. You should be ashamed sitting next to her. Yes, Sir. What’s important is that he didn’t cheat. Boo! They’re busy dating. Marry them off, Sir. Hey! Hey! Be quiet! Greetings to Teacher! Good day, Sir. Yes, good day. Sir, we'll have a remedial test, right? Yes, later. Look, she got more piercing. Let's go to my place. No one's around? You still haven’t changed your wallpaper? You're mocking my height! You're horrible! You're sulking now? Excuse me, Husband and Wife. I have to get to my lessons so I can fix my grades. Ms. Eny? Ms. Eny? Puput? Ew! You stink! Ouch! Ouch! I'll tickle you! This is what stinks. Bim. Ouch, let's get inside. I am. You are. Understand. Beautiful. You are... I love you. Be still. Lean forward. Is this enough? Don't. This is called a highlighter. It's what makes me fall in love with my husbands here. -Seriously? -Just look at them. They're all beautiful. I love you. May peace be upon you. It's a sin if you don't reply to it. And upon you as well. Keep your body straight, tilt your head. But don't smile. Say "ah". Smile a bit, with your mouth wide open. Close it a bit. Stay still, don't move around. Or it will get onto your teeth. I'm still cuter, right? I'll post it on Instagram. Please don't. You said it's only for your phone’s wallpaper. But also for Instagram. -Delete it. -No way! Delete it! I wanna post it on Instagram! Not a chance! No way! Give me your phone! -Give me your phone! -Ouch! No way! You locked your phone? What's your password? -Give it to me. -No way. -Say it! -No. -You're not gonna give it to me? -No! -Dara. -Bima. "Two Blue Stripes" Are you... ...okay? Does it hurt? Ra? Please don’t tell anyone, Bim. The process of genetic material multiplication, also known as DNA, which is inside the nucleus. So, it can produce daughter nucleus that have the same genetic materials. Form a line. Ra. -Move it. -Ra. Form a line. Boys, move it! -Bima, move it. -Yes, Sir. What took you so long? Come on. Form a straight line. Come on. Bim, what are you doing? I don't want my Dara to feel the heat, Sir. Boo! How can you stand this guy, Dara? -Get in line. -Boo! -Get back in line. -Yes, Sir. Stretch your arms! Keep them straight. Come on. Move to the side. -That's absurd! -How's Mr. Ranto? It's Mr. Rinto! You forgot your own teacher? Here you go. -Our orders are here. -Thank you. -Sorry! -Watch it, you spilled some. Just spill them all, Bim. Dara! -Hi. -Bim. Hi. Happy birthday, Ucup! Come on, go somewhere else. What did you say? Ra, you still like to sort them out? It's a waste, you know? Bim, I'm doing this because they're not fresh. How can they be not fresh? I always eat them. I'll eat them now if you don't believe me. -Where are the bad clams? -Don't eat them! -No, I want them. -I sorted them out! Marital dispute. -Look. -Don't eat them! I've separated them, please! Here. See? I'm fine. This is science! Ra, Indonesians have strong stomachs. You're just weak. Don't let him call you weak. Prove it to him. Just eat them, Dar. -Just eat them. -Eat them. Good. Who are you calling weak? That's it! Suck it! Your hand is dirty! You're so annoying! Let's just eat. -Let's have it. -Grab them. Dara? -Ra? -Dara? Ra? What's wrong, Miss? Ra, what's going on? Huh? Have a drink. What's with you? You knew they weren’t fresh, but you still ate them. I’m sorry, Ma’am. I feel guilty for making Dara ill. Why are you apologizing? Dara was the one who ate them, so it's her fault. Alright then. Excuse me, Ma’am. What's with you? -May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. So you're officially dating? Cut it out, Mom. It's alright. He’s polite. He seems nice. He's just a friend! Are you sure? Geez! -I'm going inside. -Okay. Wait a second. Be careful. It's a crappy bike. -Be careful. -Yeah. Sis, help me talk to Mom. I don’t wanna do gymnastic anymore. I wanna take ukulele lessons instead. When the time comes One that we've been waiting for I will make you happy And only you You'll help me, right? You'll be sorry if you don't. No way. Geez. Puput! That's not funny. I'll bite you. You're so mean! Are you on your period? What? "Alternating Current" Miss, can I help you? Mr. Bima? Yes, Bima. Why aren't you waiting inside? It's fine here. Right. Did you get everything? Err... Bread, peanuts, -test pack... -Here's the money. -How much is it? -It's 120.000. Here's 150.000, keep the change. -Are you serious? -Yeah, it's okay. -For real? -Yeah. Are you done? Yes, I'm done. I'm waiting for another order here. You can wait somewhere else. You're right. It's not convenient here. Will your parents stay out long? When will Puput return? Don’t you wanna do it somewhere else? Sir. I need to go to the infirmary. Bim. Bima! Bim. Drive, Sir. I can't, I have a lot of gado-gado orders. How can I leave my shop? -Excuse me. -Yes, Ma'am. Bim? Bima. How could you leave your motorbike? I forgot, Mom. Bima, people don't just reach home... ...and realize they forgot their motorbike. You're so weird. Seriously, I forgot about it. Oh, no... Are you on drugs? Did you sell your bike? -May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. Just like Mrs. Ani’s son, Rizki? What's with the yelling? Dear, our son has become a drug addict! My goodness! Do we still have the stink bean sambal? Don't eat too much! Remember your uric acid level! -Fine, fine. -Our son is on drugs, like that Rizki! Mrs. Ani's son! -Which one, Encim's or Ani’s? -Ani's! Oh, he's not the same as our son. There’s no way a drug addict would be this chubby. It's possible! Just take a look at him! I will. You have to tell me everything, Bima. You're taking drugs, right? Is it true, Bim? See? Goodness! I'm gonna faint if you're like this. I can't stand it anymore. No, Mom! What is it really? Have you gotten into trouble at school? Any certain problems with your teacher or your homeroom teacher? Or maybe... ...this is a love issue. Did you break up with... What's her name? It's Dara, right? You're dating? I've told you so many times, don't date! -See what happened! -Dear, go easy on him. -You didn't listen to what I said! -Honey, cut it out. -Let him eat first. -My goodness, Bima! Bima, wait. -Bima. -Bima? -Bima. -Bima. Just let him be for now. -Bim. -Let me handle this. Bim? Bima? If you're a man... ...you shouldn't cry over a girl. You're embarrassing me if you’re this whinny. I'm the one who made a mistake, Dad. Do you still care for her? It's easy then. If you make a mistake, you should apologize. Say sorry if you made a mistake. Easy, right? But don’t tell your mom I said that. But I made a big mistake. Bim. If it's meant to be, it will be. "What happens on week 10 of pregnancy? Your baby is as big as a strawberry." I’m sorry I was a jerk, leaving you like that. I promise I won’t... You won’t what? I've thought about it. You just have to find the place. And I don't wanna take any medication. I can ask Ms. Mila about it. Ms. Mila? She's my neighbor. She had... ...an abortion. "Pong, I need to talk. This is bad." Yes, it was Mila. She went to Ma Naim's clinic. Why do you ask? You impregnated someone? As if, of course I didn't. It's for a school assignment. School assignment? I've never heard of a school assignment about abortion clinic. My goodness! Bima! I've been waiting for you. I was told that you have my medicine. -Yes, Dad. Where is it? -Here you go. I'm sorry. Here you go. Have you prayed? I'm about to go to the prayer room. When you hear the call of prayer, go straight to the prayer room. -Alright, everyone? -Yes, Sir. -Go on. -On our way, Sir. Your son was asking about... Ouch! It hurts! You did ask me! -Was that your dad's medicine? -Yeah. -Where is Ma Naim's clinic? -Huh? -Ma Naim's. -See, you're asking that again. -Here, you can have it. -Well, okay. -I'm off then. -Off? You're not even on! Pong. I really need some help. I don't know who else to turn to. Well... If you don't mind, can I borrow some money? Thank you so much, Pong. I'm sorry for troubling you. Want some juice? What flavor? I'll have strawberry juice. Here's the money. Yes, Sir. Thank you. Ra. Ra. Dara. What is it? What is it? Do you feel anything? Back then, when my mom was having Puput, I used to touch her belly. Everytime I sing, or tell a story, Puput reacted inside Mom's belly. So what do you wanna do now? I have no idea, Bim. But I don’t want to kill the baby. I can’t. I was serious, Ra. I was serious when I told you I won’t leave you again. We'll just keep it a secret until graduation. My neighbor, Ms. Lin, she had the same experience. She tightened her belly so it stayed small. All of the sudden, she had her baby. What about our parents? If they find out, they'll forgive us. At first, it will be embarrassing. Well, it's not going to last forever. People will get tired of talking about us. Alright? What belongs to Allah shall return to Allah. What belongs to Allah shall return to Allah. Dara, Bima's here. I'm not feeling well, Mom. I’ll just stay at home today. Okay, Mom? Are you okay? Just need to lie down, I got a headache. What is it? Do you think... ...my belly will get this big? Is this one of those tricky questions? If I think you look fat or not? Well, do you think... ...I can still go to school when my belly get this big? Look. It’s December now. So how many weeks has it been? Twelve weeks. This big skirt won't be used. Then why did you buy it? It's buy two get one free promotion. I couldn't pass it up. Bim. Or... Is it safe to hide it with a jacket? I guess you could wear a jacket to school. Maybe even until May. After the national exam. Is it really that big? Here, look. -I'll try it. -Let me see. -Help me, Bim. -Oh, you poor thing. I can wear it like this. And it's still too big. Really? But... Can I still go to Korea? Of course you can. You can go to college first. I’ll find a job. Then I’ll go find you in Korea. Or how about you... ...get me into a K-Pop boy band? You can do it, right? We can try that. But it's only in your dream. Because you're just not on the same level as my husbands. Is that so? -Be careful. -I want to try the skirt... ...while I try this new dress from you. Looks so nice. Thank you. Gosh. Don't forget your plastic surgeries. Save a lot of money first. But really, I just can't wait to go to Korea. I've been dreaming about going there. Until finally, Korea, Bim. I will definitely apply for Seoul National or Korea University. I'm sure my grades are good enough to apply for scholarship. I have to attend university in Jakarta. I don't mind private university. You don't want to try UGM in Jogja? No matter what, it has to be in Jakarta. Hey, Bim. Uncle Ivan is looking for an employee for administrative position. Just try it. Why did you let Dewi chose private university? It was different, Bima. Your dad wasn’t retired back then. Besides, your grades are below average. Well... Your sister is going to get married after Eid Al-Adha. Dad, why is everything always about her? I want to take my education seriously. I want to study hard in college. Dara said I... So this is because of Dara. Didn’t you say you two broke up? You two got back together? That’s not what I meant. -So this is all because of Dara? -No, Mom. Dara is going to Korea. So now you have a new girlfriend? She will go to a university in Jakarta? What are you saying? No one is stopping you, Bim. But it has to be a state university. Or you can wait until next year. Try to get a job first. It still won’t work. Press the power button. This button. It's broken, throw it away. He's been like that all this time. He always act so cool. He wore the wrong shirt. That's why he tucked it in. What a narcissistic person. Hey! Be more careful! What's with you? Dara! Mr. Rinto! -Sir! -Dara! What's wrong? Ra! Are you okay? Tell me where it hurts. -My tummy hurts! -Breathe in. -Bim... -Breathe in. -Is Dara okay? -Back off. My tummy hurts, what about the baby? -Baby? -Baby? Breathe in. I'm going straight to the office after this. -I'm at my daughter's school. -Which way? Okay, thank you. -Good afternoon. -Afternoon. I'm Dara's dad, this is my wife. -Ma'am. -Please to meet you. Excuse me. Here's Bima. You're gonna be alright. -We're going home now. -Dara. Let's go. Let me help. -No need. -Don't you dare touch my daughter. Come on. This is my fault. Of course it is. She wouldn’t become like this if it wasn’t for you. What's wrong? -Dara. -Just a second, Ra. -Please wait. -Where are you going? Yes... Hey! Trying to run away? No, Sir. You have the guts to mess with my daughter. You're an idiot! -Dear. -Don't mess with my son. Don't mess with your son? He's the one messing with my daughter! -Our children. -Mr. David. My daughter wouldn't do such thing if it wasn't for him. Our children. -Our children! -My daughter was sullied by... -Come here! -Did he force you? My daughter wouldn't do such thing if it wasn’t for you! I'm sure Bima forced you. -I will go to the police. -Be honest with me. I will sue your son! -Dara! -Let's discuss this in a civilized manner. -Were you forced? -You were forced, right? Look at me, Dara. -You were forced by him? -Dara? -Dara. -Answer the question! -Tell me. -Were you forced? Is it true, Bima? Dara? -Huh? -Were you forced? Bima! I love Bima. I will take responsibility. Sir. Ma'am. I will provide for Dara and my child. “My child?" I'm serious. I will take responsibility. You said it yourself. Bima’s nice. Do you think it’s easy to be a parent? Even I failed as one! No matter what, Ma'am, after we graduated, I will find a job. I will earn my own money. We won't be anyone's burden. I do really love Dara. Honey. You’re expelled, do you know that? Let's discuss this at home. -Let's go. -You're expelled! Only you who were expelled, not him. And they take no responsibility. They all deny any responsibility. Excuse me? I didn't say that. According to school regulations, we can't expel Dara. But is she prepared to handle the risk? Is she mentally prepared? Didn’t you mention the school's reputation? Asking her to drop out? -Now you speak differently! -I can sue this school. -Sir. Ma'am. -I can sue this school. I'm serious. I'm asking for your consideration. For the sake of the other students. Then why didn’t he get to be expelled? Pardon me. How could he provide for their child if they both dropped out of school? I won't deny my responsibility. I will take care of this. I thought I could rely on you. That you could think for yourself. If things are like this, what will you become? Huh? Honey. Enough. We’ll discuss it at home. What should we discuss? Huh? Where the marriage will be? Where she'll have her labor? -We're in a school. -What else to be discussed? Whose house should they stay in? Is that so? From now on, you don’t have to come home again. You want to be responsible, right? You can start today. Rika. Rika. Rika, you can't do that. You're leaving her just like that? Mom... Dear. Calm yourself. Ma'am, my daughter said that... ...Mrs. Odah's daughter cancelled her wedding. I'm not sure. I heard they already sent invitations. Is that so? And they say her second daughter hasn't found a job? -See? What did I tell you? -You should tell them, Ma'am. They'll call me nosy. Their family's such a mess. It's a broken home. The husband has a lot of affairs. How horrible. I'm afraid to catch something. Just stay away from them. I don't want to. You never give me money. I gave you money yesterday! -No, you never gave me any! -Now you ask for more? You never gave me any. Do you think earning money is easy? Yeah, I'll go to the market. Look at the time! Hurry up before the market closes. I lent my motorbike to a friend. -Excuse me. -To your friend? You bought it for you to use. Not for anyone else. Do you think earning money is easy? Where's your house, Bim? Still quite far. Come. In the name of Allah. Ma'am. Bima. Hi, Pong. Hi, Sir. -Mrs. Saidah just passed away. -Huh? What belongs to Allah shall return to Allah. May peace be with you. My condolences to you. What belongs to Allah shall return to Allah. Thank you, Sir. Thankfully, all family members are here. -Hopefully she's in a better place. -Thank you. -Excuse us. -Thank you for coming. Dear, you're still outside? You have the key, don't you? No, you have it. Peace be upon you. Come on in, Ra. -May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. Come, Dara. What's with your stomach? It feels tight. Bima? Is the hot water ready? It doesn't have to boil, right? It’s for a bath, not for boiling an egg. -Hurry up. -Yes, Mom. I don't need hot water, Ma'am. Coming through. Hot water. Sorry. Have some food. It’s noisy, right? The houses in this area have thin walls. In the morning, my alarm is the neighbor's kids crying for pocket money. Just try to get some sleep. You are sleepy, right? Bim? Bima? Please don’t leave me, Bim. Bima? The fetus is normal according to your gestational age. Is it a girl? Perhaps. It can't be determined now. Are you Dara’s parents? Yes. No, we're not. She'll be staying with us for a while. We're looking after her. Just for a while. Possibly. About that, Doc... She often complains about stomach cramps. What causes it? That's contraction. A sign of a pregnancy with the risk of miscarriage. Dara needs a bed rest. At least until the next check up. Make sure that during the period, they don’t have intercourse. I swear I won’t do anything to Dara. We only did it once... Is that all, Doc? Of course not. Have you learned about reproduction at school? We have. What about the risks during pregnancy? So, pregnancy at your age has very high risk. When you're pregnant at this age, your body will endure twice the burden... ...compared to people of mature age. Your body is not yet prepared for this. Therefore, you need even more morale support. So what should I do? You mustn’t let her get stressed. Also, provide enough nourishment for the mother and the baby. Is that all? Certainly not. You also need to study... ...about other pregnancy complication symptoms. Read a lot, ask the right people. The more you know, the more ready you will be. Is that all, Doc? No, there's more. There’s also risks during labor. For example, suppose you experience bleeding during labor. Let's just stay behind. Thank you, Ma'am. Has Mom told you? Aunt Lia and Uncle Adi came yesterday. They had a serious talk. About what? About me? Mom said that she wanted to give your baby to them. Because she's not sure that you can take care of the baby. That's weird, right? We're the baby's family. Mom, why are you so mean to me? Dara. You should be resting. You... ...and Dad... You're going to give my baby to Aunt Lia and Uncle Adi. Dara, they're more prepared to become parents than you. But I'm also a parent, Mom! Dara, being a parent is not just for nine months and 10 days! It's a lifetime responsibility! Oh, really? Yes! Then why did you leave me the other day? Dara. You should take a rest. We'll talk about this later. Bima deserves to know too. Praise be to Allah. Dad. Please help me with this one for the last time, Dad. He has a point there. That baby's our grandchild too. They can't just give the baby up without talking with us. Why? Is it because we're poor? That's not the problem. Then what? This is a marriage we're talking about. What do you mean? Adultery is better than marriage? It's not that. It's not about adultery, it's the timing. They are both still children. So what do you want? For them not to get married? We don't have anything. We only have our faith and pride. I'm embarrassed everytime I open the shop! I know everyone is talking about our family. I know. We have failed. Failed in raising our son. Dear... I will talk to Dewi. Dear... My goodness! Bima, open the door. Come on, I came all the way from Bandung for you. Bima! Stupid! Idiot! How could you knocked up someone's daughter! You're so stupid! Do you realize that what you did is stupid? What should I tell Erfan? To his family? What should I tell them? My brother knocked up someone's daughter? Is that it? -I'm sorry... -Don't say anything! My life was peaceful before you came! I was fine for eight years until you were born! Did you use a condom? No! Don't answer! I don't want to hear your answer! You're so stupid, doing it without knowing the consequences! Use your phone to Google it. Don't just play games on it! No wonder you only got 20 for Biology! Do I have to cancel my wedding? Dear, just the three of us. Dewi doesn't want to come. Sis? I'm going. Don't forget to lock the door. May peace be with you. Hi, Ma'am. You're all dressed up. -Going to a wedding? -Yes. Going to a wedding or an engagement party? Is Dewi really not coming, Bim? Wait for me! Come on, Dewi. Keep going, Sir. A bit more. After 50 meters, turn left. -Just follow the direction of the GPS. -Right. Put on your seat belt, Dear. Don't embarrass your family. I can't. I have to accompany Puput to her swimming lesson. All the other moms are already waiting. I can't just cancel it. Wait, can we talk first? I can't. I have to find my phone. Eny, help me find my phone. I have to go. Where is it? Mom, I didn't tell you... ...because you probably wouldn't want to meet them. -Please, Mom. -Have you found it, Eny? Mom. -Please. -I already have an appointment. I can't just cancel it. Where is it? Have you found it, Eny? Here. Come here, sit down. -I'm not ready. -But we have to face it. -I can't. -Yes, you can. Are you ready? May peace be upon you. May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. -Mr. David. -Sir. -How are you? -I'm good. Sir. We haven't prepared anything. It's so sudden. -Please sit down. -Thank you. Please sit down. Eny, please get them some drinks. Ma'am. Please sit down. Have a seat. Let's go, Mom. I'm ready. Putri, could you swim at home for today? We have guests, okay? First of all, we'd like to apologize. The purpose of our family's visit here... ...is to propose a marriage between Dara... ...and our son, Bima. Dead end. Turn around. Dead end. Turn around. Dead end. Turn around. Dead end... We're sorry for coming so suddenly. I accept the hand of Dara Yurika, daughter of David Farhadi in marriage with the said dowry in cash. -Is it official? -Yes. Let us recite the Al-Fatihah. Thank you. "Don't Look Back You're Not Going That Way" I've searched about laboring methods. This squatting method is helped by gravity. -Is that so? -Yes. Now follow my instruction. Let's do it. Take a deep breath. Exhale. Now, follow my breathing. Come on. Come on. One, two, three. Okay, enough. There's a second method. Like what? You have to bend over. Come on, hurry. I'll sit, okay? -Like this? -I'm giving labor. Don't give labor now. Hurry. Okay, good. Bim. Can I still go to Korea? Of course you can. But, Bim... You don't have to drop out of school too, you know? I should be the one dropping out of school. Not you. You're smarter than me. But I read it on Google, that a child inherits their intelligence... ...from the mother. That's good, then. It's good. But why can't the father be smart as well? I'm thinking of taking High School Equivalency classes. Okay. I'll go to school tomorrow. Bima. Bima. Sleep downstairs. -Hi, Bim. -Hi. -Bim. -Hey. How's Dara? She's healthy. Bima will come here every afternoon, except on Saturday and Sunday, he will work all day. He has to start from the bottom. If he makes a mistake, just scold him. Yes, Sir. -Okay? -Okay, Sir. -I'm going to Lebak Bulus. -Alright. Let's hustle, hustle, hustle! Hustle, hustle, hustle! Let's get to work. Here's the bill, Sir. It's 54.000. Miss! Excuse me. You forgot your phone. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Look at Bima. He's a hard worker. Just because you're a senior here, doesn't mean you can be lazy. Isn't that right, Bima? Don't forget to lock everything. Yes, Sir. -I'll be going now. -Right. Greetings to Teacher. Good morning, Ma'am. Hello? Excuse me, can you tell me where the nearest hospital is? -Hospital? -Yes. You see the bank over there? Bro, is business usually this slow? "Hello, Dara!" "National Test Schedule for High School Equivalency Program" You know that you don't have to work here anymore, right? You should focus on your study first. But it's up to you. If you want to continue working here, it's fine. You've done a good job here. -Good night. -Night. What are you playing? I have to kill this red monster. So hard. How is your college planning going? Well, I plan to go to college. Don't take it so lightly! And worse, you skip school. Do you think I wouldn't notice? I skip school so I can work. Besides, my sister, Dewi, has a bachelor degree. With good grades. She was still unemployed for awhile. Then, what hope do you have? Do you really want to keep working at my dad's restaurant? For the rest of your life? What do you mean by that? I work... ...so we can find our own place. Do you think we can stay here forever? Do you think I enjoy working at your dad's restaurant? How convenient to use tears as a weapon. I know you're the one who is carrying the baby. But easy for you, just lay around at home. I'm the one who has to work hard. Lay around at home? Do you think I want to just stay at home? I never forced you! And I never forced you to be my girlfriend! Please excuse me, Ma'am. My mom suddenly asked me to come home. Dara. -May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. Nice place, but it would be better if the place's near the campus. What about this house? Yes, this house is nice. Surprise! We miss you! Be careful with the belly! -You surprised me. -We miss you. You look so adorable. I look chubbier, right? How cute. Come on, follow me. Let's pick some clothes for you. What do you say? This one? -Not bad. -This one's for the outerwear. Sorry. Vini told me. Still lactating? Back at the store, I covered them with tissues. I'll buy breast pads so they won’t leak next time. I was like you too. I was surprised when my breast milk leaked through my clothes. Because I know other mothers... ...produce their breast milk only right before the baby is born. I don't understand my body. It feels so strange lately. Breast milk suddenly leaking, the skin of my stomach looks weird... And then... Today, the baby kicked. But just once. -The baby's still alive, right? -Of course. We had to tease you with music to get you kicking. Let's try it. Lie down on your side. Come on. Slowly. When the time comes One that we've been waiting for I will make you happy And only you How do you know that song? Of course I know it! That song came out when I was young. Besides, Puput plays it every time she practices her ukulele. Uh-huh. Why isn't the baby moving? Maybe we need the original singer. Where's your phone? Search the song. Let's use my phone. Let's try. Lie down comfortably. Are you comfortable? Uh-huh. When the time comes One that we've been waiting for I will make you happy I'm sure the baby will like music, like Puput. Like us. Like us. Please give me time To fulfill everything Please forgive me, Mom. I will not forget I hope you'll wait Patiently No, they're still in stock. -Thank you, Ma'am. -You're welcome. -For watching over my stuff. -It's alright. Gosh, I keep needing to go to the toilet. Do you want some fruits? Miss, when's your due date? No, I'm not pregnant. Whoa! Huge age difference, right? Just like my children. My oldest child is already in high school. In fact, I never thought that I could get pregnant again. I'm embarrassed actually. The older siblings are all grown up. But we can't reject God's gift. Here. -Thank you. -That's okay. I still have a lot. You should eat them. -So, what's your "thingy"? -Huh? -Your "thingy"? -What do you mean? Your contraception method. I use IUD, but it's still leaking. The older you are, the easier it is to have a baby. We're the same. Oh, right. -Have some. -Thank you. Next patient, Mrs. Dara Yurika. Where are you? We're going to the doctor's office. I'll be going. Thank you. Okay, Mrs. Dara. Wow, the whole village accompany her. Like going on a Hajj pilgrimage. Don't you want to see the face? Here it is. The baby's healthy. Can she give birth normally? It shouldn't be any problem. So the placenta is not blocking the birth canal. The head's position is already down. Anybody wants to know the sex? Yes, we do! A consensus, that's new. Okay, this is the sex. Let's see. A boy! See? I was right. Are you sure, Doc? There, that's his penis. I thought the baby was a girl all this time. I guessed it from the pregnancy test... -You mean a test pack? -Yes, Doc. The color was pink. I thought if it's a boy, it should've been two blue lines, right? We're done with the examination. Excuse me, Doc. You're not giving birth here, are you? Sorry, I need to pee often. I'm afraid that I missed my turn. There's a nurse there. She's the one pregnant? Goodness. Sorry, can I use your bathroom? Such a long line outside. Thank you. Geez. Thank you. But, Ma'am... -I've been thinking... -Don't! Don't think about anything. Whenever you start a sentence with, "I've been thinking", I know you've already made a decision. I was wrong, Ra. I'm sorry. -I promise I will never... -Bim! Ra... I'm sorry. Please forgive your Baba. Okay? Baba means father, like dad. Does "Baba" sound good to you? You like that? Look! He's kicking. Even he forgives me. Why can't you? My mom's relatives will come tomorrow. We should meet them first. I think we should at least meet them. So that we can give our best for him. I think... I... I'm not gonna make any decision... ...without your agreement. We've tried many IVF programs. In vitro fertilization. But...they all failed. So when your mom called me, I thought... Are we allowed to visit him sometimes? Of course. But perhaps to prevent confusion... What if we let the baby call you "uncle", and Dara as "aunt"? Or "brother". Whichever is better for you. Okay? Excuse me. Let me. Be careful. Bim. I'm not a bad person. I don't have the heart as well. Mom said... ...giving birth is a one-time job. But raising a child is a lifetime job. We could get a divorce. Are you leaving me? Don't you love me anymore? I do love you, Bim. So much. Bima. This is for our future. According to our lawyer... The people from religious court will try and ask. "Is it not possible for Dara and Bima to be together?" They will ask that question. Am I right? And the answer is obvious, "It's not possible." Why not? Mom. Why? It's like we’re treating religion like a game. Our responsibility is not only on Earth. But also in the afterlife. Are you sure, Dara? Why does it have to be Korea? What’s in Korea? My future, Ma’am. I don't want to be a mom that blames her child. Why must you decide it right now? Why not wait until the baby is born? The longer we wait, the harder it will be. Bima is not ready either, right? Bima is learning to be a father. Ma'am, my daughter is already a mom. Ever since she got pregnant, she has been a mom. We're both women. We've experienced pregnancy. You should've understand the difference between a parent and a mother. I do really understand that! Mom... That is why I don't want my child to divorce. It's impossible to raise a child alone. That's why the baby must be given up for adoption. Bima and Dara are still kids. How can kids raise a baby? I'm sorry. Can we discuss this again after the baby is born? He's right. We can discuss about it later when Dara's condition is better. Let's go home. Excuse us. Dear. Excuse us. Mom. Adam is my grandson too. Who's Adam? They can't do whatever they want! Mom already gave him a name. Bima! You have to be strict as a man! Teach your son, Dear! I will, Dear. Mom. This is about raising a child. It's not a game. Just so you know, Dewi. Your dad and I were able to raise you. We can raise him! Am I right, Dear? But how old were you when you had Bima and Dewi? Goodness. How about we go and buy some baby clothes? Hmm? At least you'll have something that makes you happy. Just once. Alright. Let's go. Let's go. Your apartment in Korea is ready. Let's ship things ahead, okay? Okay? Is this all? So... Dad wants to take me to buy baby's clothes. The plan is already set. Aunt Lia will prepare everything. You give birth, she takes the baby home, then we go to Korea. Maybe Dara wants to buy something as a keepsake. What for? For her baby! There are things more important than college. Than Korea. For you, there's always something more important than the future. Can you please listen to someone else? Just for once? I can, if you help me think. Dad. Mom. Do you remember... ...back then, the first time I had my own room? At 3:00 every morning, I would go to your room. And then when I entered the room, Mom and Dad were cuddling. And then I would sleep between you two. So you would cuddle me too. Then Dad would carry you back to this room. You were heavy. No, I wasn't. I... I like to remember that when I'm sad. I seek forgiveness from Allah. The all living, the all sustaining, and I repent to Him. Have some drink. Mom. I always pray. That if I go to Hell, I wouldn't drag you with me. Well, I always pray... ...so that you'd go to Heaven. Do you think I still have the chance? If I can gradually forgive you, why can't Allah? But... If I'm allowed to ask... You have to be able to forgive yourself too. You know, since you were little, everytime you watched a movie with kissing scenes, I always covered your eyes. Did you and Dad learn how to kiss from movie scenes? We should've talk like this more often, Bim. If we had talked more often, this wouldn't have happened. This is what I tried to prevent. I don't want Adam to be with someone else. You are his parent. You must always talk with him, Bim. You're not a smart boy in school. But I'm sure that you're a good boy. Take one. Which one? Do you want me to throw up again? So, are you allergic to clams or not? You came all the way here just to ask about that? Because if you're allergic to clams, our child could have your allergy as well. The same possibility that he might be as smart as you. Or as funny as you. Or stupid like me. However he will be, I will accept him no matter what. Well, I know that I'm still 17. And maybe I will be a dad who doesn't go to college. And I will definitely make a lot of mistakes. Maybe I'm ready to lose you, Dara. But I can't lose Adam. Adam? That's My mom already gave him a name. I like it. Okay. I didn't come here because I want us to always be together. But I want to ask you to allow me to take care of that part of you that I'm ready to love forever. Please think about it. Right. This is for your parents. Or Puput. Thank you. Oh, right. You can't eat them, okay? I read on the Internet that the clams from Jakarta contain mercurius. You mean mercury? Yes, that's what I meant. -Thank you. -Yeah. Let me know if you want more. Okay. Go home, Bim. All right. I'm sure that Bima could be a great dad. Then what should I tell Uncle Adi and Aunt Lia? Puput, let's go change your clothes. Fine, just cancel it. How can you just easily cancel it? This isn't online shopping! And it's just as easy for you, isn't it? To give up your grandchild like that? What did you say? Huh? Dara! You said this is easy for me? You don't think that I'm not heartbroken? That I don't cry alone? This is not easy at all for me! Listen to me, Dara! Just because you didn't see it, doesn't mean it didn't happen. Let me talk to her. Dara! You can't raise your voice to your mom like that every time you disagree. Do you understand? You do the same. You're not me and you're not your mom. You have to be better. Dara... Dear Adam. Perhaps one day you might think that you were born from a mistake. Perhaps that's the truth. But for me your birth is the proof of the universe's kindness. Mom. Adam has to be with his family. I want Adam to have memories. With you. And Dad. And Puput as well. Adam has to be with Bima. But Bima won't be able to raise him alone. Keep pushing, okay. One more time. Are you ready? You're doing great. You can do it. Come on. Push, Dara! Okay, that's good. Just a little more. You're doing great, you can do this. One more time. Come on, push. One, two, three. Push! Keep pushing! Okay, one more time. Hang in there, just a little more. You can do it. One more try. Come on. Keep pushing, okay? Be strong. One, two. Push! Dorong lagi! Push! Come on! Come on! Push! Just a little more! Your baby is born. Bima She's experiencing complications. An internal bleeding in the uterus. We need to operate on her right away. What are the risks? The worst is death. But we have to try the best option for Dara. The last option is hysterectomy. Removal of the uterus. There's a consent form that you need to sign to perform a procedure. Do I have to sign it? You are her husband, right? Family of Mrs. Dara Yurika? Yes, Nurse. I'm her husband. Doctor Fiza informed us that we have to remove the uterus. Please be patient, we will update you -when we have more information. -Ma'm? Good luck in Korea. You don't need any more surgery. Thank you, Doc. Hi, Bim. Thank you, Doc. Wanna try to hold him? Yes. In the name of Allah. Do you think he'll understand me? Adam will not only understand you. He will be proud to have a mother like you. You said it yourself. Being a parent is for a lifetime. I'm sorry, Dara. It's not fair for you to suffer all by yourself. Adam is more than anything, Bim.
