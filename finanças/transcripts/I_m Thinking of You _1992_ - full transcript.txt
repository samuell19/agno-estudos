I didn't think they would shut down. Me too. An hour before I was busy planning things. I was so happy with my good news. And then this. What are we going to do now? What will you do? If you...

Congratulations, Mr. Charlier. Please come to the stage. Yes, with madame. You win a ticket for two people. Madame Céline Ferraro! Congratulations madame, please come here with your partner.

They are needed there. A welcome applause for Mr and Mrs Ferraro who are now also on the stage. And, Mrs Ferraro are you happy you won? Yes, very happy. My husband has to leave to Manchester, this way I can visit him. Manchester... What will you be doing there, Mr Ferraro, if it's not indiscreet? I will be starting a technical traineeship to... work in a factory... which is being built... What's wrong? Fabrice, tell me! There is no more Manchester! I've been sacked! Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. Where are you going? -Home. You forgot the lights. My Fabrice... I'm here. I'm your wife. Go back to the others. -No. Yes, go. -I'm staying with you. Are you asleep? For you. Gas en electricity. -Thanks, Céline. Céline, he doesn't have his ticket. It's okay this one time. It's not expensive here, but not free. You have to go to Rue Nicolay. How did it go yesterday? -You should've seen us. Both in tears, the goodbye was too difficult. Céline, phone! - One moment. Look what he gave me. -What? Earrings. Who is this? Hello? Who am I speaking to? Do you know what he proposed? Céline, are you listening? -Yes. What did he propose? -That I go with him. To Canada? -Yes, to Montreal. To start a restaurant together. What would you do? -I would go. If we would all go? You could help me, you know English. And Fabrice would definitely find work there. Mama! Mama! What are you doing here? Did papa not come to get you? -I didn't see him. Come here. Do you not have anything to do? Did you ask in the garage? I'm a metalworker, Not a mechanic. And Renzo? He suggested spoil tip security. -Did you take it? Sometimes I think it would be better if we left. Where to? -A place where you could find work. Where they're waiting for me? They don't need people like me anywhere Don't say that. Why should we leave? You've just been promoted. I want to go if I have to. It must be tough to pretend that you care about me? I asked you something. If you continue like this, we'll go crazy. You don't see anyone anymore. You leave papa alone on the yard. You don't care about Martin. What do the others do who were also sacked? Go visit them. -You didn't answer. Stop it. Answer me. -It's your birthday tonight. You think you are too good for me? I am good for you. And you are good for me. And where is your mother? -Looking for work. Look, my frog. You can touch it. Go take it to Martin in the car. If he doesn't go to school he'll become a frog. You're lying. I don't have to go to school. No? And what will you be later? - A toreador. There's no one in the car. In the past, workers had to walk on the edge of the tanks filled with liquid steel. Sometimes they fell in. In the fire? -Yes. Those blocks there, That's steel that some one fell into. In stead of making steel sheets out of them they're put here. Like a cemetery. My dad... Your grandfather... from the picture in the kitchen... -With his mustache? Yes. Well, he fell into the fire like that. You're quick to be worried. Have a seat. No time. I still have to run meals. They're not going to die of hunger. Have a seat. Did he go to see Renzo? -Yes. And? Spoil tip security. Well, it's better than nothing. Can you encourage him? He doesn't listen to me. Give him some time to digest all of it. Look, for Martin. I wore those when I came from Polen. I'll re-paint them. He can dance on them during the carnival. Nestor! He's up there. Wait here, I'm going to get him. How long have you had that with your paw? Well, if I wouldn't have come... There's no one here anymore We're all worthless. Except for you. Hello, Céline. What's happening? -An exercise. It's Jack. I know some one from an organization working against poverty in Liverpool. He'll be here next week. You should talk to him. Yes... I'll call you back. See you soon. Everything's okay. They're on their way. Yes... yes papa. He found them. Calm down. Calm down. Come. Don't worry. They found them. Everything will be okay. Why did he do something like that? I don't understand. -Me neither. To act like that because he lost his job as if there's nothing else. You made it. So you don't care about the rest. Made it? I try to survive, that's all. Why do you say that? Everything I do is for you. For you and Martin. I don't have a family, I'm alone. You know... - Don't begin with that again. You were my only love, Céline. My only love was Fabrice. Why did you do that? I didn't want to see anyone. And what about me? Don't you understand anything anymore? You're ruining yourself. And also us. Happy birthday. This registers movements in the west. Within this zone there's no danger. Have there been prolapses? Twenty years ago, across the street. Since then, nothing. Paradise on earth right? These are the seismology forms That's where you fill in the levels. And this is where you class them. If the tip starts to move, you press 0 for the fire service. Who does all this belong to? The previous guy. He'll come and get it. A real artist I'm going back to the truck. Spoil tip security... -Sorry. There's nothing else at the moment. You'll find something else. Something else? -Yes. I don't know... There will be new mills. It will be as before. -For our children. But what can I do? I don't have a diploma. What I know, I learnt at Sidermeuse. Fire, steel, heat, that's my work, it's what I love. Now I have to change because the gentlemen write off our steel. You have to go with the times, if not... The engineer is asking for you. -I'm coming. Come on. Can I speak to Céline Ferraro please? I see. No, it's nothing. Open the door. Fabrice, open up! He wants to introduce me to a colleague who works in Liverpool. Shut up. Shut your mouth! Open the door! You pity me don't you? "I need you, Fabrice. I'm your woman." Liar! What do you tell him? That I'm an idiot? That you're afraid to leave? Open up! Look at me. You despise me, don't you? Say that you despise me. Let me go. Hello?... Yes, Martin. Yes, I'll pick you up tonight. Kisses... Yes, from grandpa. Jack Brendon. I'm not here. Tell him I'm not here. Yes, come upstairs. What's wrong with you? What do you want? What do you want to proof? I need to know more about this remarkable man. A man to whom I'm very close. Probably the closest... We both sleep with the same woman after all. Fabrice, you know that's not true. How can you say something like that? I don't want to see him. Let me go. -You stay here. Let me go. - Stay here... open the door. Good evening. Come in. Mister Brendon. Welcome. Come in, come in. Céline will be a moment. She's doing her make-up. Okay. Yes, for you. Shall we drink something? What can I get you? A beer? Or something stronger? Whisky? -Sure. Sit down. No need to be shy. Are you ready, Céline? Mr Brendon is getting impatient. What do you see in her? What? What do you see in my wife? I'm not sure what you mean. You should know what I mean. She's leaving me for you. Makes sense. What can she do with a man like me? You can have her by the way. Please. Take advantage, go on. I offer her to you. Take her. -You're joking. Not at all. I'm dead serious. I know I'm inadequate. Hurry up, Céline. That's about enough. You're not funny at all. I'm ready, Jack. You worked at Sidermeuse, right? Yes. -Were the welders sacked as well? I need ten of them. Guys in need, that really want to work. I'm not interested. -You're stupid. You get 10.000 Francs for every man you get me. Get lost. As you like If you'd rather rot here... And Henri? Are you his replacement? -Obviously. Pretty, right? That's me. Can I stay for a chat for five minutes? - No, another time. Who do you think you are? Who sits here, is no better than me. The nights are long here. You will see. You'll be happy to have me. So long... Mister supervising guard. Here. Eat. Eat something Call the commissioner's office. You went there this morning, Céline. Do it, please. Go on. What's this here? A fight at school. It was Laurent, he said that papa was dead. I told him that it wasn't true, that he went to Manchester. And then we fought. I told you... that he went to Manchester and that he would come back soon. But I don't know where he is, and I don't know when he will come back. Someone who disappeared is not necessarily dead. Do not worry. You've been saying that for two months. Someone must have seen him. Trust us, madame. Do not despair. I don't understand. HOUSE FOR SALE Do you like it? -Very much. Could I see the ground floor again? Of course. I'll join you. What are you up to, Martin? Digging up my treasure, because we're leaving. Tonight, the deal will be done. I won't sell. -What? I will not sell. -But it was you who proposed it. I changed my mind. Madame Ferraro, for six months you already owe me 300.000 Francs for these materials. I wanted to wait until you sold. Now I have buyers and you don't want it. Give me two more weeks I find the money or we sell. You'll never find it. And two weeks is too long for me. I can give you a week. Mama! Grandpa has fallen! -Papa! I'll call a doctor. Papa! Are you okay? I'm okay. The bag in the shed. Go and get it. Did you sell? That's good. He'll come back. Open the bag. They're yours now. Before you go, I want to ask you something. You always said that when us metalworkers ascent to heaven, should help God to make it thunder. Give us beautiful thunderstorms, Marek. So long, my little boy. Will you send us postcards? -Count on it. I don't know, but to just leave like that... leave you al behind... It's as if I'm abandoning you. -Of course not. You'll be happy there. It's a beautiful country. I will miss you. -I'll miss you too. Go, or you'll miss the plane. Take this. Goodevening. One beer. Karina! Are you offering me something? What are you drinking? -A small champagne. Where are you from, choco? The airport. I'm guessing it's the first time you come here? Very sharp. Everyone who passes, steps inside here. I don't know why. There must be something here that attracts them. How much is it to go upstairs? For you... two-thousand. Stop it with the trompet. I said stop it! You can play when you paid your debt. Let him be. Are you coming? 300.000... I can lend it to you. I don't understand why you're so stubborn. After the roof it's something else. Are you sure you want to live there? I don't know. But if I sell, he'll never come back. You think he'll come back. No one knows where he is. No news in months. Maybe we'll never see him again. Yes, you can expose these. Can you lend me the money? If it helps you. Thank you, Laurent. -Celine. Yes? What do you think of me? Why do you ask that? -Just to know. I think you're a nice guy. I'll walk with you. Look. The poster for the carnival. For Martin. How nice. Thank you. He'll be happy with it. Come for dinner tonight? -Sure. I'm counting on you. Can I get an advance? Again? You already got three weeks. I need it. The last time. Yes? -It's me. Yes? It's me again. -Is the door not working? Celine. I... I need to ask you to forgive me. I saw Fabrice. Is someone there? What is it? I... I want to speak to Fabrice Ferraro. They told me he was here. -Who are you? His sister... After work they come through the back. It's better to wait for him in the courtyard. Over there. Dank u. If you are his sister... tell him he needs to pay me rent. How much does he owe? Two months. Ten-thousand. That's sweet. Sisters like you are rare. You gave one too many. You're not going to make any trouble are you?-Nee. You can wait in his room. Two up, to the right. There is someone here. We're waiting for you. We need you. Hey trumpet player! Get up! You need to go to work. You told me you had work for two months. The ditch is done. No more work for you. -Dat recht heb je niet. I'll go to the police! -And what will you tell them? Have you seen your face? That it's you who runs all the cash in hand work in the region. Get lost. What will you tell them, huh... bastard! Hah, you want to be a snitch! Go back to your own country to work! You like to be a snitch, huh... Well go ahead... snitch! I don't like snitches! And... are you still going to snitch? Let him go. -Don't interfere. Don't start! Is it okay? -Yes, it's okay. Shall we go?
