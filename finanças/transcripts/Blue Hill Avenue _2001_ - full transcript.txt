Lathan Butler was a 17-year-old kid... who swore up and down he was comin' up in the world. They thought playin' us would be easy money since we were younger than them. We played because 20 bucks is hard to come by when you're a teenager. Besides, I think we had somethin' to prove. I'm a bad mother! Gimme the money! Gimme the money! My $20, baby! My $20, baby! Hell, yes! Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, motherfuckers! - Who's the squad now? - Shut the fuck up, man. - Yo! Where the money at, Lathan? - Hell, yeah!

'Cause he was gettin' faded in the teachers' lounge. If you wanted weed, you could go just about anywhere. I mean, there were plenty of dealers out there... who would sell you a nickel or a dime bag... of just about whatever it was you were into. But for variety and that really good stuff... and for the dealer who never ran out of your favorite stash, you had to go to Sam's place. Yo, who's winning? Sox. Last inning. Rice just doubled. Damn. Pee Wee must be feelin' pretty good let you come out after dark. Usual? Nah. He want four Thai sticks and two ounces of the Buddha. All right. You wait right here. I'll be right back. And look, don't none of you little motherfuckers touch my food, especially you, you little fat fucker. Hey, fuck you. Who the fuck is he callin' fat? - Your fat ass. - Fuck you. What the fuck you... Hey! What the fuck? What's wrong with you? - Come on, guys. Let's go. - You ain't gonna pay?

They probably don't even know we left yet. How much shit did you get? Man, I don't know. Damn! We gonna get higher than a motherfucker! Hell, yeah! What you trippin' on, Tris? What if we didn't smoke all of it? I know you ain't talkin' about sellin' it. Why not? But where, man? Lathan and them got it locked down from Gold Fall to Four Corners. In case y'all don't remember, that was Benny up in that Cadillac this afternoon. And I ain't tryin' to fuck with Benny, man. Who said anything about sellin' it on the streets? We can sell it at school. All you got is a few burnouts selling nickel bags to they friends. We'd be the only crew. We could supply the burnouts and take they customers. And that ain't even the beautiful thing. What's the beautiful thing? We don't have to worry about gettin' caught... 'cause we gonna be supplyin' the teachers. Ain't no teachers gonna buy no herb, Tris. Shit, man. We just saw Mr. Thomas buy from Sam today. Damn motherfuckin' skippy. Shit. I'm with you, Tris. E. Me too. Let's do it. Let's do this. Let's go. When we ran out of the stash we ripped off from Sam, we started buying from him to supply our customers. Pee Wee squared it with Sam about us stealin' from him, so we let him get high as much as he wants. We were buying so much shit, it didn't matter to us. At first, we thought the money was pretty good, but we had to kick so much of it back to Sam... that we realized he was the one gettin' paid. That's when I decided to grow our own shit, and then the paper came in nonstop. E-Bone got pretty good at growin' that shit too. Twinkie helped us out by lettin' us use the back room... in one of his girls' apartments. We kicked back a couple hundred to her every once in a while... for lettin' us keep the place. She appreciated that and let us know. We couldn't believe the life we were livin'. Where you goin' E-Bone? Where you goin', boy? That's some dope new gear you sportin', E-Bone. - Get up, girl. - What the fuck y'all want? You ain't so tough without your crew, you little punk? I told Tristan I was comin' back for my shit, didn't I? I guess I'm just gonna have to take it out your ass, ain't I? We bombin' on all you punk-ass bitches! This is our motherfuckin' block! Hey, Uncle Rob. Hey, little Mack. How you doin'? Good. Pretty good. Hey. The place... The place looks good. What this place looks like is empty. It ain't caught on the way I thought it would. Boy, what are you doin'? It's the first of the month. Look, the rent on this place ain't gonna pay itself. The money don't know where it comes from, so just take it. Boy, if your daddy knew what you was doin', he'd kill you. And if he knew I was taking money from you to run this place, I'd be just as dead. But he doesn't know, and, as long as he lives, he doesn't ever need to know about this, right? Right. The barbershop's gonna pick up. I know it will. I mean, I believe in you, Uncle Rob. What good is makin' money if you can't do nothin' with it? You know, boy, sometimes I think you the grown-up and I'm the child. Now, we gotta get on home before Mama's dinner gets cold. Hey, Tristan, hold up. There's somethin'... I been wantin' to talk to you about for a long while now. I really gotta go, Uncle... Don't you interrupt me. Now, if you gonna be in this game... And from the looks of things, it looks like you done made up your mind about that... You got to realize that this is a losin' game. Drug dealers don't have pensions, they don't end up with retirement funds... and they don't end up with the big house on the hill. They end up dead or wishin' that they were. So, what's your point, Unc? Make a plan. That's the point. Do somethin' with your money. Set yourself up to get out of this game when the time is right. I'm talkin' about investments... Legitimate investments. Now, I'm gonna take this money as an investment. You investin' in my barbershop. I'm gonna teach you the ins and outs of this business. From now on, we not just relatives, we are partners. And we gonna make this a success together. Partners. Partners. All right. You tell your mama I'm gonna be a little late. All right. Y'all go on and eat without me. All right. Baby, you haven't eaten your mashed potatoes. I don't like them. But they'll make you big and strong. You've been saying that for years, Mom.

Someone try to break your legs too? Took you guys long enough to get here. Shut your ass. Can we see him? Come on in. - Hey. What up, fellas? - What up, E? What's the deal, E? How you feelin', killer? Come on, now. Edward, I want you to finish this. Look, Nana, I need to talk to my friends. I'm not going anywhere until you finish eating. It's okay, Mrs. Winslett. I'll make sure he eats it. I'll make sure he eats it all. - Is that all right with you, Edward? - Yes, Nana. I'll be outside if you need me. Okay. Make sure he eats all of it, Tristan. Yeah. Make sure he gets it and not Simon. I ain't gonna feed ya. - So, do you feel as bad as you look? - What took y'all so long? Yo, it was Lathan and them, wasn't it? - Yeah. - Yo, it don't make sense, E... Him fucking you up like this over a couple of ounces? Three months ago? It ain't makin' sense, E. Hey, what you talkin' about, man? We straight embarrassed him, in front of Benny too. I say you got lucky, E. He might have killed your ass. - Look, what happened, E-Bone? - What you mean, "What happened?" I got fucked up. That's what happened. Look, Money's right. Lathan wouldn't have came after you like this over a couple ounces. - Yeah. Come on, E. - Too much time has passed. So, what happened? Look, I was doin' business on the street. You bullshittin'. - We said only at school. - Man, I know what we said. But there's money on the street, kid. I'm telling you. So, in other words, you almost get killed for a few pennies. Man, is you stupid? Pennies? Money, go over there and bring me that jar of peanuts. Shit. Man, let me help you. Yeah, and this is only from me working just three weeks. Man, imagine all of us working, man, for months or even years. Just think of all the shit we can get, Tris. Yo, what about Lathan? We still gotta deal with him. Man, fuck Lathan, man. Look. Hey, where the fuck you get that, man? Dennis and his brother Randy robbed a gun store in Brockton a couple days ago. They got all kinds of steel. We can get anything we want. Let's go, fellas. Get better, man. Hey, I want y'all to know somethin'. I wasn't holdin' out on y'all. I was gonna tell you. I just wanted to see what was out there on the street, you know? Yeah, man. Yeah, man. We know. Get better. Take care of that eye. Holler at you in a minute. - Hi, Tristan. - Hey, wassup? Shit. You're not gonna speak? You talkin' to me? I ain't talkin' to myself. I don't think I remember your name. You gonna do me like that. You're cute and everything, and I know you got this little mack thing goin' on, but I can't be messin' with no drug dealers. I ain't no drug dealer. Come on, Tristan. I'm not stupid. So you do remember my name. Okay, so maybe I do, but that doesn't change the fact that you're... What's that? Open it. It's beautiful. It's yours. I can't take this. You have to. It's nonrefundable. Listen, I hear you on this little drug-dealing thing you're talkin' about, right? But I ain't no dealer. I just help out my friends from time to time. That's all? That's all. I promise. Thanks for the necklace. So can I walk you home? Okay. You look beautiful with that. - You sure they in there? - That's the word. Let's do this. I wasn't content with what we had just dealin' at school. E-Bone kicked off the inevitable. First rule of business... Control the market. It was time to elevate the game. Shit. How many books y'all get? Y'all count 'em up. I gotta take a piss. Lathan be cheatin'. When he comes back, I'm gonna put a bullet in his ass. That's why I don't like playin' with him, 'cause he always be cheatin'. ♪♪ Aw, shit! What the fuck you goin' to do, bitch? Little Tristan? You better kill my ass right now, motherfucker, if you got the balls, bitch. Mother... I read this book about World War II one time. Damn. One of the soldiers said that every time he killed someone, he saw the face of the first man he murdered. It's like none of the other faces register. You kept killin' the same guy over and over again. Mama. Lathan was the first cat I ever killed. The soldier was right. I killed other dudes, but, to this day, I can only see Lathan's face, knowin'... Come on, Tris. Let's go, man. Knowin' he was gonna die. Come on, man. Let's go. In less than a second, what little bit of childhood we had left was gone. I had made decisions about my life based on my friendships with my boys, but, until that moment, I could always walk away. Now there was no walkin' away. Lathan! I was no longer a kid. Now I was a gangster. We all were, and that's the way we wanted it. Weed is a pretty lightweight drug, even back then. In that game, you usually ain't got to worry about no one tryin' to murder you. I killed Lathan because he was becomin' a pain, and I knew I would feel better once he was gone. Now everyone had no choice but to take us seriously. But I had to keep telling myself over and over, it was just business. I said it enough times that I actually started to believe it. There wasn't any reason to kill the rest of 'em. Without Lathan, they were nothin'. And no one goes to the cops in this neighborhood. Things were different now. We were ghetto superstars before, but, after we took out Lathan and took over all his customers, now we were ghetto legends.

As usual, they were wrong. How about it, Tris? Any idea why somebody'd come in here, rob your uncle? No, man. - No idea whatsoever? - That's what I just said. Well, why is it that I don't believe you? I don't know. Maybe you just a naturally suspicious kinda guy. Let me ask you a question. Why would they send two vice detectives to investigate a robbery? Fourteen-Paul... Drug-related theft. And what makes you think it's drug-related? I don't know. Maybe because the owner is a drug dealer. Whatever, man. So, what happened, Tris?

Hey, I didn't call them. They just showed up. Kinda like fungus. It ain't funny, Unc. Torrance and Tyler have it in for me. You know that. I told you not to talk to them clowns. I didn't call them, and I didn't tell them anything, Tristan. Look, I'm not one of them little punks on the street. So do me a favor... don't talk to me like I am. I'm sorry, Unc. How much did they get anyway? Couple hundred dollars out of the register. Couldn't open the safe. Why don't you put bars on the windows and doors like everybody else on this street? I've been livin' and workin' in this neighborhood all my life. I ain't never had no bars on the window. I ain't about to start now. Times change. You got that right. Twelve-year-olds killin' each other. Goddamn psychopaths everywhere you look. Look, I just came by to make a bank run anyway. How much we got to deposit? About four grand. Cool. Be safe. I will. Hey, look, Unc, um, I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier. I didn't mean it. That's okay, Tristan. But you see what I'm talkin' about, right? What? About the neighborhood. Yeah. How things change. Yeah, I heard you. No, not just how things have changed, but w they've changed. Have you asked yourself that question? Come on, Unc. Things change. Times are hard. No. There's more to it than that. If you got somethin' you wanna say to me, just go ahead and say it, Uncle Rob. Look, it's the rock, Tristan. Rock has fucked this neighborhood up. No. Think about it. There's junkies everywhere. It never used to be like that. Crack has got these people so wrapped up, they're willin' to... To rob, to-to maim, to kill anybody... just to get enough money to get their next high. It was a crackhead who broke in here. You don't know that. Tristan, you got a reputation. You got a reputation for murderin' people. Now, what motherfuck in his right mind... is gonna risk robbin' this place so you can find out who they are? You, E-Bone, Simon and Money, you might as well be the motherfuckin' mob. Who's gonna go up against that for a couple hundred dollars and some change? So some motherfuckin' crackhead came in here and robbed us? That's just one case. You don't believe that, and I know you don't. You don't wanna take responsibility, but, hey, I can understand. Now you wanna blame me for all the fucked-up shit in Boston? Crack is the problem, and you're the biggest crack dealer in the Sound End. Fuck you, old man. God! We set up crack houses... all over the South End. Blue Hill and Intervale was where we made the bulk of our money. If you wanted cocaine, you didn't come to us. You just phoned it in, and we came to you. E-Bone did most of the cooking. He cooked up to eight keys a day without fail. Then we asked someone from the neighborhood we thought we could trust... to make sure that everything stayed stocked and kept track of the weight. In the Blue Hill Ave house, that was Buzz. Maceo chopped the keys and broke them down into ounces. He added the benzocaine, the procaine or vitamin B to the weight that was chopped. Day-Day would take the orders over the phone, always in code, so no one listenin' would know what was really goin' on. And then he'd hand each one of them to the runners... along with a package of what was ordered. Simon ran the house though. In fact, he ran all the houses we had. 'Cause it didn't matter how bad you were, nobody fucked with Simon. - Nobody. - Word. When Money wasn't gettin' laid, he kept everyone in line. If anything went wrong, Marlon was the first to know about it. Most of the time, the problem was handled before I even knew about it. Hey, what the fuck is all that noise out there, man? Hey, baby. Hey. You okay? Why wouldn't I be? 'Cause you sittin' in here in the dark. So. What? What's goin' on? Remember that? Man. Where'd you get this thing? I found it at the bottom of my jewelry box. That thing is ugly. Hey. My little eighth-grade sweetie gave me that. Shut up. Well, he had terrible taste in jewelry. Good taste in women. Terrible taste in jewelry. So, what's the matter? Not quite workin' out like we planned it, is it? "Workin' out"? What do you mean? I mean, after 12 years of broken promises, you still in the game. "Broken promises." The roof over your head, clothes on your back. Those don't seem like broken promises to me. That's survival. And, you know, I believed that for a long time... You know, that "survival" thing. But look around you. We do a whole lot better than just survive. What do you want from me? I want you to quit. Just like that? You know, you and Uncle Rob suffer from the same damn disease... selective memory. I didn't hear none of this when we went on vacation last year to Hawaii. And I didn't hear none of this two years ago when your mother got sick... and couldn't pay her damn hospital bills. You didn't have nothin' to say about me quittin' then. What difference does it make when I ask you? And, Tristan, you know enough is enough. Well, I find it very interesting that it's okay for me... to risk my life so that you can wear this Gucci drawers frufru bullshit. But now that your stomach is full and you ain't hungry no more, all of a sudden it's okay for you to tell me it's time to quit? What's the matter, Gucci ain't in style no more? I can't believe you just said that to me. I call it like I see it. So that's what you think of me after all this time, after all that we've meant to each other. That's what you think of me? Look! I don't need this shit right now! Okay? Martine, I can't quit right now. My friends need me. And I don't? I've been there for you from the first day I laid eyes on you, lovin' you, I can't believe I'm havin' this conversation. It's because of them fuckin' friends. It's them fuckin' friends are all I've ever heard from you! If you thought... I mean, really thought... That all I wanted to do was take from you, then why'd you marry me? I'm not gonna do this with you. If you want me, I'll be at the club. Don't you think we ought to squash this before you just walk out? I'm not the one with the problem! You are! Is that what you're gonna tell your child? What did you just say? I didn't just ask you to quit all of a sudden, Tristan. There was a reason. Yeah. Yeah, you guessed it, player. I'm pregnant. You sure? No. I just pulled that out of my ass and made it up. Then why the fuck you ain't tell me when I came in here? I wanted to know if you would quit because I asked you to, not because of the baby and not even for yourself... Just 'cause I asked you to. You're playin' games, all these motherfuckin' games. Is there one woman in the world... that ain't about damn games all the time? I expected more from you. Shut up. - Hello. - Wassup, man? Look, man, I can't talk to you right now. - I'm dealin' with some shit. I'll call you back. - This ain't a social call. We need to talk. About what? Not over the phone. Meet us at the club in 20 minutes. All right. Don't keep us waiting, man.

Everything's cool. Everything's cool. ♪♪ We found out later the guys who attacked us were high. I don't even think they knew who we were. Uncle Rob was right. The neighborhood was changing. Damn. What the fuck happened to y'all? Car accident. That other car had a good right hand. Never could put one over on you, Gant? You forgot somethin'? I took the wrong keys. I want the keys to the Land Cruiser, not the S.T.S. - How y'all doin'? - - Shut the fuck up and get outta here. You keep your pager on. You hear? The troops heard you in the Gulf. - So, how you doin', Benny? - I could be better. Yeah? How's that? I want you to shut down the operation on Blue Hill Avenue. Shut down? What the fuck you mean "shut down"? I want you to cease selling drugs on Blue Hill Avenue. We make a lot of ends on Blue Hill Avenue. Yeah, a whole lot of ends. The drug game is killin' the pimp game. I came up in that game, and I wanna keep it alive. Now there are too many ho's gettin' strung out. Money is money. What do you care where it comes from? Now, I know the drug ends are bigger than the pimp game. But since before that drug shit hit, and long after it fades, ho's will always make money. Always. Also, it's always good business to specialize. From this point on, I want Blue Hill Avenue to be known for pussy... and pussy only. Well, we ain't in the pimp game, so what's in it for us? We're gonna make a move into Rhode Island, open up some new markets. - That's for y'all. - That's a good start, but we need more immediate gratification. What do you want? Twenty-five percent decrease per key. You must be out of your fuckin' mind. It's a deal, but it'll take time for me to... adjust my operation to the new price. How much time? A couple weeks. Fuck that shit. We don't have to ask your sorry ass for nothin'. We can make you do whatever the fuck we want. Somehow, Gant, I don't think so. Hold off, hold off. We'll do it. For two weeks at the current price. That's two shipments. On the third shipment, you take a 50% cut on every shipment after that... until we make up what we lost. Then after that, the prices goes back up 25%. Deal. All right. Good to see ya. Make sure these gentlemen get their weapons. Boss, they got it together. Their shit is tight. Yeah, but Tristan's the key. Them faggot-ass motherfuckers ain't nothin' without him. Can't get to Tristan, not with Simon watchin' his back. Well, you get Twinkie up here. And you call our friends. I want them in on the conversation. Not a problem. ♪♪ Man, you know that deal was some bullshit. - You know that, don't you? - Yeah, I know it. Then why the fuck did you agree to it? Wasn't no sense in pushin' it. Benny never planned on deliverin' the shipments at the price we agreed on anyway. I was just buyin' us some time. Well, if he don't plan on doin' business, what's he plan on doin'? Takin' us out. He just needs an excuse. I knew I should've peeled this cap right then and there. Man, I don't understand why. I think we' gettin' too big for him. Gettin' harder to control. It's just good business. Yeah. For all he knows, we may be plannin' to move on him. He got to do it right though, 'cause he gets hurt in a war just as bad as we do. How you know all this? A few reasons. Benny agreed to the deal too fast, man. He wants to keep the price the same just long enough... to figure out a way to eliminate us. Second, he don't give a fuck about no ho's. That shit was some straight-up bullshit. I figured, man. That shit didn't even sound right. - So, what we gonna do? - We got two choices. We either go to war with him or we quit. - Quit what? - Quit the game. We can't do this shit forever, man. I can show y'all how to make the investments I been tryin' to do the last few years. - How long you think we can do this? - "We hustlers till we die." Remember that? Ain't nothin' else, motherfucker. Man. I ain't really down for quittin' either, man. I mean, this is the only shit I know. Hey, yo, I feel ya on that investment shit, T, but I ain't got shit saved either. All the shit we done did, and you ain't saved nothin'? Hey, look, man. It comes in, it goes out. I ain't never thought about savin' no shit. Fuck that shit. Leavin' the game ain't even a motherfuckin' option. Fuck Benny. We gonna bomb on him and his whole motherfuckin' crew. Fuck all of those motherfuckers, man. We gonna kill 'em, we gonna buy from his supplier... and we gonna get our better deal that way. I don't know how much longer I can do this, man. Man, and who the fuck you been talkin' to? I bet it's Martine, ain't it? You gonna stop rollin' with your homeys over a fuckin' bitch? I'm gonna let that go, E, 'cause I know you upset right now. But if you call my wife a bitch again, I'm gonna kick your ass! Man, fuck you and your wife. Come on, man! - What you wanna do, man? - Hey, yo, be cool, E. What's wrong with both of y'all, man? Man, fuck that shit. All the shit we done been through, and he wanna throw it all away 'cause he whipped on some pussy. Ain't no pussy in the world that good, motherfucker. Hey, motherfuckers! We don't need this shit right now! This is not the time to be fallin' apart, a'ight? Look, man, everybody need to calm the fuck down. Tristan, what you doin'? I'm walkin', man. Hey, yo. We need you, dawg. You can't just walk out on us now. I ain't walkin' out. I'm just gonna walk around for a while. I'll get up with you in the morning. We shut down the hill. We still gonna do that? Yeah. Gotta figure out what's what, make Benny think we don't know what he's up to. All right. So I'll get with you tomorrow, right? Go on. Wassup? Wassup, yo? Where's everybody else? They didn't show. Shit. Everything's gonna be cool. Long as me and you stick together, it's gonna be a'ight. Look, I threw out all the hype... and had Buzz and them board up the place. That oughta convince Benny that we really shut it down. You ready for this, man? 'Cause it's gonna get ugly. We ain't got no choice. Quittin' ain't an option. Besides, E-Bone was right. With Benny gone, we'll get a better price. Yeah. Get everybody together tonight. Figure out the best way to do this thing. A'ight? I'll see you tonight. Hey, yo, Tris. Yeah. You know, somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew one day it would come to this... A beat-down between us and Benny. It's like we were meant to do that shit. - I feel you, yo. - Like that car that night. After 12 years, man, you still can't get over that thing? Somethin' about that car, dawg. - What? - You don't think I'm stupid? Man, just say what the fuck is on your mind. You know, part of me feel like I was supposed to get hit by that car that night. It's like every second that I've lived after that has been borrowed time. That's why shit don't scare me. 'Cause maybe I ain't supposed to be here anyway. What do you think? What do I think? I think thinkin' is the problem. You thinkin' too much. Let me do the thinkin', all right? - What you sayin', I'm stupid? - No. Hell, no. I ain't sayin' you stupid. I can't have no stupid motherfuckers watchin' my back. But you didn't get hit by that car that night. It missed you, and that's that. - That's 'cause you was lookin' out, dawg. - Whatever, man. The point is, as far as livin' on borrowed time, we all might be one step away from the grave. All we gotta do... is handle business, and everything gonna be all right, a'ight? - All right, yo. - Watch out! Watch out! What's he plan on doin'? Takin' us out. He just needs an excuse. I knew I should've peeled this cap right then and there. Well, well. You still have nothing, or else you would've arrested me by now. Maybe, but I know what's runnin' through your head right now. Yeah? And what's that? You're asking yourself, "How did he get that tape? And now that he's got it, what's he gonna do with it?" Let me tell you somethin'. I don't give a shit where you got it, and you can shove that shit right up your ass, 'cause I'm quite sure that shit's not admissible. Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. But doesn't it bother you that one of your crew dropped a dime on you, that right now we're working with one of you to bring the rest of you down? This tape, it may not be enough to convict you by itself, but it's just the first piece of evidence in a long line of evidence to come. That's bullshit. How else would I get it then? How else would I know where you guys were unless one of you told me? So, who was it then? That's for you to find out. I got a hunch though. I think you already know. We're closed, fellas. So what's it gonna take to reopen? Not tonight. You gotta go, buddy. Look, two shots of bourbon, a little information, we'll be on our way. What do you say? The shot I can do. If you want information, dial 411. Maybe I'm not makin' myself clear. I'm lookin' for four brothers that are running things out here. T-Mack, E-Bone, Money and Simon. - Ring a bell? - Never heard of 'em. And you're sure about that? Yeah? Trust me, amigo, you won't make it. Why don't you leave your number? What, are you looking for some action, baby? You ain't got to call me. I got a truck right outside. - Watch your fuckin' mouth, Jack. - Hey, fuck you, slim. - And don't be callin' me Jack. - He didn't mean anything by it. Yeah? Well, I don't give a shit. That happens to be my name. Besides, he doesn't know me well enough to be callin' me by name. You are real close to crossin' that line. And it's obvious you guys ain't from around here. So why don't you put away your gun now? I'll take your number and pass it on to someone who might be able to help you. And forget the whole thing. If not, you're gonna have a problem. Really? Yeah? You're scarin' me, baby. Well, it ain't me you need to be worried about. All right, baby. Pedro, put it away. Vinnie, give these guys another round on the house... and something to write with. I'm gonna be at this number till the end of the week. After that, I'm gone. Where to? To Miami. - I'll see that they get it. - Yeah, you do that. 'Cause it'll be worth a whole lot of dough to them if they do. And I mean a whole lot of dough. For you too. Hell, maybe you can even buy this place or a place like this. You should think about that.

Yeah, my cats is all ready to do they thing too. I'm just not sure that this is the right time. Might be the only time. How do you know? Maybe Tristan's wrong. Maybe Benny ain't got shit planned for us. Is that right? That's not what you said the other day. - That was then. This is now. - Yeah, what happened to change yo mind? Ain't shit changed my mind. Somethin' happened. I just had time to think. Well, what you thinkin' about? You scared of Benny too? I can't believe you said some shit like that!

How is she? As a direct result of high amounts of ether in her system, she's developed a hole in her esophagus. That hole started to bleed. We've been able to stop the bleeding, but I think she needs to remain in the hospital a few days for observation and some tests. But she's okay? For now, she's stable. Yes. - Can we see her? - We just gave her a sedative. She's sleeping now. But you can go in. Thank you. There's somethin' I've been wantin' to ask you for a long time. We provided you a good home.

What's it gonna hurt to talk to him? Why you campaignin' so hard for this dude? I told you... I get a cut. We already got a supplier. Maybe you know him. A big-headed, ugly motherfucker named Benny. Who's overcharging you, and you know it. You guys are paying 18 grand a key when you should be paying 15. I think it makes good business sense to keep all your options open. - How you know all this? - I listen. I hear things. You got a sweet thing with Benny. He got your ass set up with that restaurant and shit. Why you tryin' so hard to get out of it? I don't see a dime from that place. I made that place, and I don't see a dime.

I been around enough players in the game to know a cop when I see one. And he ain't no cop. But if you're so worried, why don't you have him checked out? And if he does check out, you willin' to go up against Benny? After what we just did, you got the nerve to ask me that? You got a point there. Excuse me. Mrs. Mackey? Can we ask you a few questions? I'm afraid I can't talk right now. I'm very busy. That's not what you said before, Martine. I never should have helped you. Hey, maybe that's the smartest thing you ever did. What do you want? We just wanna help you help Tristan. He's in a lot of trouble. The only chance he has of gettin' out of it alive is us. You don't wanna see him dead, right? So we need a little more information. Look, you've gotten all the information you're gonna get from me. 'Cause you don't wanna help Tristan. You only wanna help yourselves. Excuse me. Don't be stupid, Martine. Dead is a long time. Fuck off. Yeah, man. Hi. Hi there. Where were you? I went to the Vineyard. Didn't you get my note? What note? This note? "Dear Tristan, "I went to have the chain you gave me fixed because it was broken. "I know this little place in Oak Bluffs that will do a good job. "Thinkin' about us, the chain reminds me how much I love you. "You do what you have to do for us and for yourself, "just as you've always done, "and I'll be here for better or for worse. No questions asked. Martine." It looks nice. I love you, Tristan. You'd never keep anything from me, Martine, right? Anything important, I mean, right? Right. Why would you ask me that? Because trust is everything. Without it, you have nothing. Do you agree? Yeah. Then what the fuck were them cops doin' here then? They were here for you, Tristan. Why? I don't know why. I don't know. They didn't say. That's it? They didn't say nothin' else? That's it. They didn't say nothin' else. Look, Tristan, um... I don't feel well. I'm just gonna go lie down, okay? It's probably the baby or somethin'. Yeah, you should do that. Shit. Fuck. Who is it? It's me, young pimp. I need to rap to ya. Twinkie? Yeah. You know what fuckin' time it is? It's about 4:00 a.m. What you doin' here, man? Like I said, I came to rap to ya. You don't know me, motherfucker. Don't ever just show up at my fuckin' crib. Let me know when you're through actin' like a little bitch. What'd you say? Look, I know you don't think I came over here for my motherfuckin' health. I got business with you, boy, and the sooner you stop fuckin' around, we can get to it and I can be on my fuckin' way. You got three seconds to say what the hell it is you gonna say. Not in the hallway. Five minutes inside, then I'm out. Come on in. Can I get a drink? Say what the fuck you gonna say, man, and get the hell outta here. Can I at least sit down? Sit down, motherfucker. Damn! Look, this ain't no easy thing to say, so I'm just gonna say it. Your mother used to be a ho. She worked for me until just after you was born. Is that what you came here to tell me? You don't seem surprised. I ain't no kid, motherfucker. I been around a long time, seen a lot of shit. You gonna have to come better than that to surprise me. She ever tell you about your father? She said he was a salesman or some shit out on the coast. She lied, man. I'm your father. There you go with that bullshit again. You need to shut the fuck up. Man, why would I say some shit like that if it wasn't true? Well, if she was a ho like you say she was, how the fuck you know who my father is? When she got pregnant, Violet decided to quit hoin'. She was in love with me, and she thought we was a family. She was one of my best girls, man. I just wanted to prove to her you wasn't mine, convince her to give you up for adoption so she and I could keep rollin', you know. She swore up and down you was mine, and damn if she wasn't right. It's true, man. I ain't lyin'. So why you tellin' me this shit now? 'Cause I made another promise... to myself... that, before one of us... died, we'd both know the truth. You sick, man? Can you just get me a glass of water? Twinkie. Why didn't you just kill Benny when you had the chance, man? What? You and your friends... You got too large. You made him nervous. Then you gave him an excuse. What the fuck you talkin' about, man? Blue Hill Ave, man. We closed that place down. We're not doin' business out of there anymore. Well, one of you still is. Look, Simon, he's got me, man. I got to do this. I got homeys... that'll hunt you down till you drop. They gonna be dead soon after you. Forgive me, son. Simon was my best friend. It was all startin' to fall apart. He was gone, and the only thing I could do for him now was pray... "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust." Miss Davis, I don't know what to say. I'm real sorry. I thought everything was gonna be okay now that Thomas was back in his life. Thomas? You knew him better as Twinkie. Well, what's Twinkie doin' in Simon's life? He's his father. Now, you'd think he'd care enough... to show up for his own son's... Why weren't you there for my boy, Tristan? He would've been there for you. Let me go! You all right, man? No. What's the word? Simon's soldiers are fightin' for power. They ain't gonna be no good to us if we war with Benny. And without Simon, my people won't budge. Hell, I can't even get the motherfuckers to return a page, never mind combat. Everybody knows Benny killed Simon. Maybe he didn't pull the trigger. But they figure that we ain't got a chance now. So, they don't wanna be around when he comes after us. Ain't nobody talkin' about who d pull the trigger? Nah. But Buzz said when they found him, there was "T-W" written in blood on the floor. But that can mean anything. We gotta figure out what the fuck we gonna do. That ain't got nothin' to do with me. Come on now, T. So, what, you just gonna leave us hangin', man? Did you say "T-W"? Yeah, man, but that could mean anything! Simon! My baby. God. What? - I know who did it. - Who? I'll tell you on the way. Come on. Let's go. Martine. I gotta go. I got somethin' I gotta do. You're gonna go after him, aren't you? Look, I don't want you to go back to the house. Take the car and go to your father's house. Why? 'Cause ain't nobody gonna find you in Malden. Tristan... Okay. - Is he here for you? - No, Tristan. - Why would you even think that? - Stop the game! I know it was you. You broke my heart. Tristan, he said he wanted to help you. - And you believed him? - Yes! I wanted to believe him! Because I wanted you out of this so bad! So I thought I was helping. That's how you help? Help him put a bug in Simon's car? What? No, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't help him do something like that! - Ain't no sense in lyin' now. - I'm not lying, Tristan! I didn't do that. I told them when Rob's barbershop got broken into. That's it. What? Torrance and Tyler came up to me a while ago, and they asked me if I wanted to tell them anything. If there's anything that I had to tell them, to give 'em a call. But I didn't tell you because I know how you feel about the police. But, for some reason, I thought that they could help me. So, when Rob's barbershop got broken into, I gave Torrance and Tyler a call. They came down. I thought that they could help, but they didn't help. And all they did was, was harass you that day. And I thought that... All they did was use me to try and get to you. But I swear to God, that's all I told 'em. I didn't say anything else. I swear. All right. All right. - I believe you. - That's all I did. I wouldn't set Simon up. I wouldn't do that. All right. All right. I swear it. I'm so sorry. I believe you. I gotta go. No, I gotta go. No questions asked, remember? Come on. Come on now. Come on. No questions asked. I'll see you later at your father's house. I promise. A'ight. So who did it, man? Twinkie. Twinkie? Why in the fuck would Twinkie wanna kill Simon? Benny sent him. He knew Twinkie could get close to him. How in the hell he know that? Twinkie was Simon's father. Damn. That's what that "T-W" stands for. Son of a bitch. Yep. Simon was tryin' to let us know who murdered him. One string is pulled as the quilt begins to unravel, and Simon is dead, six feet under, covered by dirt and gravel. Now your travels have led you astray... as you stand at the pitchfork of life deciding which way. Will law of the four slain down to three... wait for more? Not knowing left from right, as tear-filled eyes become quarried. See, your determination superseded your high education, and, instead, you became a street scholar. You bled, broke bread, as you knew the other three would follow. But now you a man. Your aura, melancholy. Your reign over Boston begins, Tristan, Simon, E-Bone and Money. ♪ A newborn child ya got and your wife wants ya to stop ♪ ♪ Childhood allies realize something you can't have ♪ ♪ A love that won't be able to last ♪♪ I'm gonna ask y'all one fuckin' question, and I need to know the straight-up truth. Did either one of y'all let that cop... Torrance put a bug in Simon's car the night we left Benny's loft? - Hell, no, man! - Fuck, no. He came to see me a couple of days after that, and he had... A tape... With us in the car that night. Tyler came at me with that same bullshit. So they came at y'all with the same thing then? He must've came to Simon too. He came to all of us, hopin' that one of us would dime the other three out. And it almost worked, man. I need to hear this from y'all, straight out of your mouths, so that we real clear and we ain't got no problems. Man, I ain't had nothin' to do with no bugs, man. I wouldn't rat out my homeys, man. I can't believe he's dead, man. I can't believe they killed my boy. All we got is each other now, Tristan. We need you, man. We need you back with us. And this shit is real, a'ight? 'Cause this here ain't no motherfuckin' joke. I'm with y'all. Don't worry about that. - Let's get this over with. - All right, baby. Let's go. Let's go. I can't relax. I still can't fuckin' calm down. Maybe if you would just tell me what the problem was, I could help you. No. No. Where you goin'? I'm gonna go make the money. Where do you think I'm going? Get me a beer before you leave. No. Wassup? Lay low for a while. What the fuck you mean, "lay low"? We missed. Motherfucker, I told you! I'll get 'em. Chill. Motherfuckers! Shit. Maribelle! What the fuck's takin' you so long? ♪♪ Maribelle! Motherfucker, you had to know I was gonna come for your ass. I knew. Answer me one question before you die. How could you kill your own flesh, your own blood? Tristan. Please, don't. - Answer me, motherfucker, or you die slow! - Tristan, don't!

Yeah, well, how does 15 keys at 16 sound? That's a lot of weight to flip 1,500 miles from home. Yeah, well, I'm lookin' for a new market, and I heard you could take the weight. Besides, it's only 1,385 miles. - I can do 13. - Yeah, well, I can only do 15. We got a deal at 14. - Yeah? Fourteen-five, then. - I test at random. Yeah, I thought you might. Where? At a warehouse. Sumner Tunnel. Behind the airport. In two hours. At a minute past that, we're ghosts. "We"? - Yeah, there's four of us. - All right. I'm three deep. - All right, you're on then. - Yeah. They stayin' at the old tech building. Near the airport. I'm gonna get a room across the street at the Rustic so we can keep an eye on 'em. - I ain't tryin' to get set up here. - Yeah, I feel you. I feel you. Shit, that's cool then. That should be enough to set us all up somewhere else. We can get some shit jumpin' off in St. Louis. I ain't leavin' Boston. I feel you on not wantin' to leave, Tristan, but without Simon, we ain't got no choice, man. - We can't win. - I'll take my chances. You still gonna roll with us though, right? Somethin' in the pit told me not to go. And I really meant to say, "No, I'm goin' home, man." But what came out was: Yeah, I'll roll. Cool. Look, I'm gonna meet y'all there. I gotta go handle somethin'. - Don't be bullshittin', a'ight. - I'm comin', man. Don't worry. A'ight. "Friends." Sometimes I think that word is gonna kill me. Aw, isn't that sweet? You two goin' on a little trip there, E-Bone? Man, what the fuck do you want? Where's Tristan? I don't know. Why is it that I think you're lyin'? Fuck you, man! No, man. Fuck you, motherfucker!

Maybe plannin' on doin' a little bit of business... with the new heavy hitter in town... What's his name... Jack? You can get a little weight to flip wherever you land. Am I right? I'm right, aren't I? I'm listenin', motherfucker. All right. Whatever you make from that deal is yours. Now you just make sure that Tristan is there when it all goes down, and at least one of those Cuban motherfuckers winds up dead, so that we can pin it on Tristan. You call us when it happens. You hold him there until we arrive. Now, you do that, and you can walk away with whatever you're holdin'... free bird. Man, why y'all got it so bad for Tristan? Simon's the muscle and Tristan's the brains. Without him, you wouldn't have made it past 16... without a rap sheet as long as your arm. He goes down, and we're the one's bringin' him down. You and Money are just peons. We don't give a shit about you. Simon's already dead. We want Tristan. Besides, it was Tristan who planted the bug in the car for us that night. Man, that's bullshit! Why, because he said so? What the fuck else you think he's gonna say? It was him! Now, he knew you couldn't win a war against Benny. And he's just doin' what he always does... cover his ass. Well, maybe I'll take my chances of gettin' out of here without you. What, and have to split the take with Tristan and Money? Ain't gonna be much left for your honeymoon over here with "Miss Bim-From-Bo." Can you live with that? See, our way, you take all the money... and all the drugs for that matter. I don't care. You slip out of town nice and easy. We get Tristan. We leave Money to deal with Benny. Everybody goes away happy. We're gonna need the money, Eddie. What's it gonna be, E-Bone? You'll know when I call. If I call. Not good enough, man. We need to know now. Look, man, we do it my way, or we don't do it at all. All right. O-O! Hold it!

Two reasons. Number one: To show you... that you could not beat me. Which brings me to number two. I want out. I want my life back. I stay in Boston, but I'm out of the game forever. How do I really know you're out? The briefcase. The money. If that's not enough... Chill. I walk outta here... and the slate is clean between us. What makes you think... I'm gonna let you walk outta here? Two reasons. Number one: I know you respect me too much to shoot me in my back. And the second one? I want you to do something for me. Sure. What you need? I want you to kill Simon. Simon who? How many Simons you know, motherfucker? Shit. I can't do that, man. You got no choice. Shit, he's my son, Benny. You know that. And I ain't been much of a father to him, but goddamn, I can't kill him. Yeah, that's why he won't be expecting it. Well, I won't do it. Go ahead and kill me. I ain't doin' it. Go ahead. Shoot me right now. Fuck it. You know that's not my style, Tommy. Remember about 12 years back? That little white cutie who used to work for you. What was her name? Lloyd, please, slow down. You almost killed that kid back there. Please! Shut the fuck up! Okay? I can't fuckin' believe you. I've been looking for you for two months. Two fuckin' months, Monica. - Monica. - Yeah. That's right... Monica. Why do you do this? What do you... I mean, what the fuck did you do? What did you say? Just thinking of letting that fuckin' nigger touch you, all those nigger tricks do shit to you, it makes me wanna... It makes me wanna fuckin' puke. Now, it's a shame she turned up dead. They found her body in a Dumpster... a couple of blocks behind Sam's old place if I recall. You shut your fuckin' mouth, Lloyd. Do you hear me? Don't you ever call him that. Ever! He loves me. He fuckin' turned you out, Monica! Her boyfriend did that after he found out she was trickin'. - Shit, I ain't had nothin' to do with that. - He loves me. Loves you? He fuckin' turned you out, Monica. That nigger. He fuckin' turned you out. He's more of a fuckin' man than you'll ever be. What did you just say? I'm sorry. I think you did it. At least I can have... my people to make it look like you did it. They never caught the boyfriend. And there ain't no statute of limitations on murder. Shit, I done time before. Not for murder, you haven't. And this is Murder One. Now, you wait till the D.A. finds out that a big black pimp... turned out an innocent lily-white girl... and then killed her. Shit. You'd be lucky to get life. And that's hard time too. The rest of your motherfuckin' life in a rat-infested cage. Now you think about that. Now what it comes down to... is your life... or the life of a motherfucker who don't mean nothin' to you. Your life ain't much, but it's gotta mean something to you. Now we can avoid all that... by you doing me this simple favor. He's my son, Benny. You brought him in the world, and you're gonna take him out. And I want it done before the week is out. Tristan gonna come after me with everything he got, man. Don't you worry about Tristan. We got a party planned for that little motherfucker... right after Simon's funeral. You need an ashtray? That there motherfucker's a Persian rug. A'ight, man. A'ight. Get the fuck outta my sight. Torrance and Tyler put a wire on Twinkie... just in case you tried to cross 'em. Twinkie made a copy of the tape. Cops worked for you the whole time, didn't they? That's how they were able to put the bug in the car. You told 'em we were gonna be here. That was the real reason you wanted us here, wasn't it? Cops were smart. They didn't talk the whole time the tape was running. And you didn't mention 'em by name. So that leaves you to take the fall... all by yourself. Put the motherfuckin' guns down. You keep that as a souvenir. I got others. A lot of others. I told you. You could never beat me. Was good seeing you. Fellas. I told Benny that I beat him, but I was as big a loser as he was. My parents were strangers to me now. Joanie was hangin' on by a thread. I miss Marlon and even E-Bone, who in some ways was closer to me than anyone. Deep down inside, I think Ed was right. I didn't do it for friendship. I did it for myself. He was the only one who figured that out. I think that's why he was so angry. And Simon. I knew something had been haunting him all these years. His mother's words ring in my ears. I should have been there, but I couldn't save him this time. I'll miss him the most. The family I had known for the last 12 years was dead, and there was no one to blame but me. The thought of that was just too much to take. Motherfuck... Mother... Motherfuckin'... Motherfuckin'... Hey, man. You movin' on or what? Yeah. Sorry. My man didn't know just how right he was. I was moving on. I regret a lot of the things I've done. Maybe if we never took that stash from Lathan that day, maybe none of this would have ever happened. Maybe he'd even still be alive. But don't get it twisted. I'm not apologizing for any of it. If I had it all to do over again, knowin' what I know, I'd do it exactly the same way. My past makes me who I am...
