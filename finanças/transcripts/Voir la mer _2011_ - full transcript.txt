Go on, what are you waiting for? -Excuse me? -Go talk to that girl. She's clearly waiting for you. -Me? -Yes, you. Who else? I don't know why no one's asked her. Maybe she doesn't like to dance. Or guys don't dare ask her. So, she's bored. Hi. My name is Nicolas. Want to dance? You don't like to dance? She likes to dance, but not with just anyone. Okay, I get it. No, wait. Listen to me. What's your name again? -Nicolas. -Listen to me, Nicolas. Nicolas, so confident. Don't go thinking a girl like her would dance with a guy like you. -I don't know. -I do know. So, apologize. For what? I didn't do anything wrong. For bothering her. "I'm sorry, miss, I won't do it again." Calm down, Max. It's only dancing. Even so! -Go on! Say it! -You're completely insane! Are you okay? I'm fine! -Thank you. -Help yourselves. Thank you! Where are you going on vacation? -To Vendée. -Where's your brother? Finishing Mr. Calmel's car. We can't have a drink without him. -You're going to Vendée? -That's right. -Need a hand? -No, I'm fine. Hush, listen. Do you hear clicking or not? -No clicking. -Perfect. Another car that gave me hell. I don't understand what you have against Citroëns. They're vicious cars. Sneaky, even. When we were kids, Dad would only drive a DS 19. Going on vacation was a mess. Clément and I took turns puking. -True, the old DS was a pukey car. -We'd be green when we got there. Have a good vacation, everyone. -See you tomorrow. -See you. Hello. I left home. And… Does your husband know? No. Not yet. We weren't married anyway. What's going to happen now? Soon, he'll come home and he won't find me, so he'll open doors, calling out my name. "Prudence, are you there?" -Prudence? -That's my name. Prudence? He'll call my cell phone, which will ring in the apartment since I left it there. Did you leave him a note? Yes. I only wrote that I was leaving. What do you think he'll do? He'll understand. He won't do anything. Can I stay with you? Just a few days. I won't be any trouble. What are you doing? Nothing. Getting my stuff. We're almost done. Hello. Hi. Excuse the mess, it's such a tiny place. It gets cluttered quickly if I'm not careful. It's… No, it's nice. Can I take the pressure cooker? And here are your keys. That's it, then. -So, goodbye. -Goodbye. Why were you with Max? Do you know a lot of men who'd give you a ring on the first date? On the second date, he admitted he sold costume jewelry. Still, getting that ring was touching. So, can I stay with you? Now's not a good time, my vacation just started and I'm going away with my brother tomorrow morning. Doesn't he have a girlfriend? He did. She dumped him, that's why we're going away together. -Like in our summer camp days. -Where are you going? -To Saint-Jean-de-Luz. -Is it far? Well… I'll show you. Imagine this is a map of France. Brittany would be here, and we're about here. Saint-Jean-de-Luz is there. You need to cross your fate line, your life line. It's not exactly close. Can I come with you? Well, the thing is, my brother is… Please. I've never been to the sea. That's him. This is my brother Clément. This is Prudence. -Hi. -Hi. Excuse me. Who's she? I don't know, she's Prudence. -Where did she come from? -Nowhere. How long have you known her? -I don't really know her, I… -How long? Since last night. And she's coming with us? Yeah, she… She invited herself along. When are we dumping her? Why would you want to dump her? Because! It was supposed to be just us. -She's never been to the sea. -Boys! Are you coming? A fucking Citroën. Thank you. Goodbye. Is your brother always in a bad mood or is it because of me? Don't worry, he's just a bit grumpy. He's got some issues at the moment, so… It'll pass. I can tell I'm bothering him. You think? Why does he never smile or talk? I told you, he has issues. You can't understand. It's a brother thing. He's jealous that we're together. -We're not together. -Right. But he thinks we are. As the eldest, he's supposed to date pretty girls, and me, ugly ones. That's why he's sulking. Hold this for me. -Clément. -Yes. -Are you okay? -Yes. Your brother says you're sulking because you're jealous. I'm not sulking. I don't know why he thinks I'm jealous. -Jealous of who? -Of him. I don't see why, it's totally stupid. You swear you're not jealous? Of course I'm not. Look at me and say it. I'm not jealous, period. Okay. All right, then. Everything's fine. -What did you tell him? -Nothing. It's all good. Oh, shit, run! Prudence! Prudence! -Who's that wacko? -It's Max! -Max? -Prudence's boyfriend. I'll explain later! Prudence, come back! -Please forgive me. -Why is he here? I have no idea! He can be anywhere, he's a salesman. And Prudence? Where is she? Prudence! Prudence, forgive me! Come back, I'm sorry! I won't do anything to you or your friends! I swear! That guy is fucking nuts. Prudence! Prudence, if you don't come out, I might do something stupid. Does he have a weapon? Of course not! Why would he? -Fuck. -Prudence, I'll start to count. Before I get to ten, -you come out. -He's insane. Run into my arms, we'll forget everything! -One. -Don't listen to him, he's nuts. He acts like a jerk, -then he apologizes. -Four. He's done it 100 times. Are you okay? -Seven. -For now. You scared us. Where were you? Over there, not too far. And ten! Too bad, Prudence! I'm coming for you. You asked for it. -What do we do? -We don't move. He only has a flare gun, -to look scary. -Let's go. -Prudence! -Stay calm… I am calm! Where are you? Prudence! Let's go, run! Prudence! Prudence! My love! I need you! Prudence! Prudence! Come on. Shit, shit. Hurry, he's coming. You do it, then. Fucking German car. -You're too stressed, calm down. -I am calm! Hurry the fuck up! I am hurrying up, what do you think? Shit, it's him. We're dead. No, he can be scary, but he's not really mean. Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. There he is! He's seen us, lock the doors! Fuck, fuck. Hurry up, Clément! Clément, please! What are you doing? Come on, start. I can't do it. It's always the red wire under the blue one! -I fucking know! -Start the car! The red wire behind the blue one! He's got the keys! Shit! Come here! Push him out! -Come here! -Get him out! Get out! Get off me! Give me the keys! They fell down. The keys. Drive! A flare gun that shoots real bullets? -You think that's a thing? -I don't know! He must have a new gun, I didn't know! -Sorry. -Yeah, you should be! We could have died! -Are you okay? -Yeah, we're fine. I'm sorry. He hurt my shoulder, that jerk. Would you like a massage? Sure, thanks. That feels good. I don't understand why I fucked up with the wires. Don't worry. The main thing is we got away, right? Yes. Usually, my brother can start any car without the keys, I swear. Even the most complex ones. -One day… -I said it doesn't matter. Go on, it feels good. Let's go to Saint-Jean-de-Luz in his Audi. -Oh, yeah! -No way! We're not thieves. I don't know that man. Sure, he tried to kill us, but I have nothing against him. Let's put everything back in place, lock up the car, hide the key somewhere, and leave. That girl is nothing but trouble. Why do you say that? She's bad luck. -No! -Yes. Everything's gone to shit since she's been here. Like what? That business with her boyfriend? -That was pure chance. -Let's say it was. "Chance" shot at us with real bullets. First example. Isn't she pretty, though? I didn't say she wasn't, but she's bad luck. You're a pessimist. I'll take a pretty girl who's bad luck over an ugly one who's good luck. That's a debatable choice. Mind you… a pretty girl who's good luck… Mind you, yes. How are things with Juliette? I don't want to talk about it. -Wait. -As you wish. Now I don't owe him anything. -Let's get going. -No, not there. I told him we'd put the keys under a rock. -Who's him? -Max. What? You called Max? Sure. To tell him where his car is. How will he find it otherwise? We can't be jerks about it. No, you're right. Let's not be jerks. -Here. -Thank you. Wait, you called Max with my cell? Yes, I don't have mine, so you loaned me yours. So now he has my number? Why does it matter? I don't know, but still, he has my number. Second example. I can't believe these people. -God damn it! -What are you doing? Nothing! I'm watching out for Audis! That's an original watching position. Right, make fun of me. -What if Max shows up? -He won't. He's over there, sitting on a hill, crying like a idiot, wondering how he got there. -That's not very cheerful. -No, not very. -Oh, shit! -The bus! -Can't you see it stopped? -Wait! What if Max is on the bus? -Did you think about that? -We'll see! Stop being so pessimistic, it's scary. -Can I help you? -Hello, sir. We phoned, it's about the ad. I'm Clément of Montbard and this is my brother, Nicolas. I'll get the keys. He'll think we're noblemen. Why? Clément of Montbard sounds noble. No, Montbard is just the place we're from. What does he care if we're from Montbard? It was so he'd know who we are. Then you say, "We're from Montbard." "Clément of Montbard" is lame. Here we are. -It's great. -Oh, it's… That's right. Yep. Great. What do you think? It's yours? It is. Did you think we'd hitchhike the whole way? A house on wheels, it's crazy. Where did you find it? From an ad. This old man wasn't using it anymore. He renovated the inside himself, it's spotless. So? What does she think? She didn't say, but I think she likes it. At least we have the same dreams. Maybe he went around the world twice with it. Or maybe just went to Lavandou with his wife. Do you want a tour? Of course. It won't take very long, you'll see. Can I stay here? Of course. Mommy, if only Mommy, if only Mommy, if you saw the life I'm living I'm crying as I'm laughing Mommy, if only But my future remains bleak And so does my heart Time flies by just like a train While I sit by the window I'm so clueless that tomorrow Happiness may come And I wouldn't recognize it Wait for it. Mommy, if only Mommy, if only Mommy, if you saw the life I'm living I'm crying as I'm laughing Mommy, if only But my future remains bleak And so does my heart Mommy, if only Mommy, if only Here we are. -Are you coming to the shop? -No need for all three to go. Someone should stay in the van, it's safer. You're right. You stay, I'll shop with Prudence. Why should I be the one to stay? It was your idea, you said it was safer. I agree, it is safer. I said someone should stay, not necessarily me. Let's flip a coin. Tails. Heads. There's another solution: I stay, and you do the shopping. Oh, true. That's another solution. I'd like to shop with you. Girls are better at it. Not necessarily. Do you need something in particular? Some butter cookies, and mustard. To eat together? No, but we should get mustard, we're in Dijon. -How much, the coin? -Two euros. -That's something. -Yep. -Does she eat corn flakes for breakfast? -Who? Prudence, who else? I don't know. -You don't know what? -If she eats corn flakes. How do you not know? She slept at your place. Slept and nothing more. And, yes, she ate corn flakes, but it's all I had. It doesn't mean she likes them. She doesn't hate them. Yeah, I guess. No, not those. Special K are for people on a diet. So what? It might upset her, as if we thought she's fat. -You fucking complicate everything. -No. I just don't want to be insensitive. Okay. You pick, then. With sensitivity. Hello, Mrs. Ledoyen? Hello, Maxime Levos speaking. I'm sorry to bother you, but I had some trouble. I'd like to see you. Are you closed at noon? I took a bit of everything since you don't know what she likes to eat. -What's this? -Kinder eggs. -Did you take them? -Who else? Don't you like them? They come in packs of three, convenient. Wait. What if we bought her a ring to replace the one she gave back to Max? Oh yeah, good idea. That's a pretty one. Is it for a gift? Yes, of course. Do you know the young lady's ring size? -Uh, no. -No. It's okay, we're just looking. I'm missing quite a few models, but the salesman is coming by later. If you come back tomorrow, I'll have more choice. -We'll come back. -That would be better. -Tomorrow. -Or later this week. -Goodbye, ma'am. -Have a good day! Goodbye. -I'm sorry. -Sorry! What's going on? -Nothing, nothing. -Nothing. Here. Look, look! Oh, shit… I can't fucking believe it. Let's go, slowly. Hello, Mrs. Ledoyen. I'm sorry I'm late. I have to sit down. I'm exhausted. Interesting. You have this model again. I'm sorry? Which model? This ring. I think we'll stop carrying it. It's a shame, though. It was pretty. I don't know what it's doing there. Oh, yeah. This is great. Let's stop here. -Prudence? -Yes? Pick a hand. I don't know. You pick. -No, you pick. -Left, then. Thank you. Here. Why are you going to Saint-Jean-de-Luz? -To see our mom. -Really? We're the same, then. -What do you mean? -Well, yeah. I'm going to the sea, you have your mom to see. We could say that. Mom isn't very old, but her health isn't great. On the phone, she always says she's fine, but we know that's not true. We're going to visit to get the real picture. And because it's been a while. -Can I help? -Sure, if you want. Here. This is a nice one. -What about your dad? -Our dad? He's around, we don't know where. He gave it all up ages ago. -All what? -Everything. He left over 20 years ago. Zero news since. He could be dead. -Stop it. -It's okay to not have a dad. Especially with a mom like ours. -Right, Nico? -Yeah. How about you? Oh, me… It's complicated. No, it's not complicated. It's actually very simple. No dad, no mom, no brother, no sister, no dog, no cat. Not even a guinea pig or a goldfish. Nothing. -I don't believe you. -Why not? You never had a family? No, none at all. I'm an orphan, as they say. Abandoned by parents I'll never know, raised by nuns. -You never had anyone? -Yes. I had Max. That's why he's older. Everybody knows. If you're a girl who didn't have a dad, you'll fall for a guy who could be your father. Like Max. And now, no more Max. So? So? I have no one. Actually, that's not true, I have you. I left Max and found you two. And together, you're better than Max. Much better. And separately? Separately, I don't know. I don't want to know. Why not? I can't imagine you separately. Do you smoke? Usually, no. But tonight, yes. Time for bed? Yes, if you want. How do we do it? -How to we do what? -Go to bed. He's asking because there are only two bunks. Would you mind sleeping in the same one? No… Not at all. No, not at all. Get some sleep. We have a long drive tomorrow. Jesus Christ. -What are you doing? Where are you going? -Outside. -Why? -For a smoke, I can't sleep. I'll come too. Are you okay? More or less. Because of Juliette? Sure, because of her. There are plenty of fish. Easy to say when you've never been dumped. What do you think of Prudence? I don't know. Of course you know. How is she? Unexpected. You're cute, asleep. Then why wake me up? You're cute when you're awake too. Where's Nico? Why did you sleep outside? To leave you in peace. Nonsense. Did you sleep well? Great. Can I help you? No, it's fine. I know where everything is. Shouldn't we wake your brother up? Do you think you're okay to drive? Sure, no problem. We feel great. We'll have a shower and set off. Except there's no shower. Oh, shit, you're right. Too bad, we'll set off anyway. -We'll play the radio loud. -Yes. We'll take turns, we're used to it. We've done it before. Or I could drive. -Do you know how? -I wouldn't offer if I didn't. I mean, do you have your license? Drive towards Moulins Clermont. -I know, you wrote it down. -I want to be sure. -Drive safe. -Sleep well. I'm having second thoughts. You'll see, I'm sure she'll manage just fine. Still, we barely know her. So what? You've got nerve. Why did you pick that bunk? Because it smells good. -I shouldn't have? -It's fine, but… It's Prudence's bunk. I know. That's why it smells good. Yeah, but you didn't have to… Which one would you have picked? This one, of course. Well, now you have it. May I join you? -Bon appétit. -Thank you. Oh, no, crap… I'm not hungry. Why take all this food if you're not hungry? I don't know. Out of habit, I guess. But now, I can't eat. I didn't sleep a wink. Worrying makes it hard to sleep. I have worries. -What kind? -What kind? The romantic kind. A wonderful girl left me. I must have fucked up, but where? It's no use crying, she won't come back. Don't say that. -You never know. -I do know. I'm a dumbass, okay? I let her go. That's why I'm not hungry. If you'll excuse me, I… I'll leave you to it, but I want to say one thing. Yes? I envy your appetite. Come on! Get up, sleepyheads. What's going on? It's really hot out and I want to swim. -Are you coming? -Yes, of course. Yes, good idea. There. Come over there! You've never been to the sea, but can you swim? No. I never learned. I mean, no one taught me. But that's super dangerous! Why, if I've never been to the sea? True. I kind of know how. I'll show you. Quick. Prudence! Are you all right? I don't know what happened. You scared us. Are you really okay? Yes. It was stupid of me to say I sort of know how to swim when… I'm actually pretty useless. Thank you. What about us? What about us? Wouldn't you say we're also pretty useless? Well, yeah. It's not complicated. I'm here, you're there. So what do we do? Keep dancing around each other? Do you know what the trouble is? There's three of us. Including two brothers. And… a girl who won't pick. Because she likes them both, more than anyone before. So I'll ask again, what do we do? It's simple. I'm sure you'll agree. We just have to share. Share ourselves. Like a cake, in equal slices. So no one gets jealous. You wouldn't want that, right? No, no. We all agree, then. Should we draw straws? What for? To leave it up to chance. The one who draws the longest twig wins. And the one with the shortest doesn't really lose. Nobody loses at this game. Who goes first? -Clément. -What? What? No, nothing. What's going on? Nothing. Well, everything. What do you mean? I'm in love, Clément. I'm in love. It's not like it's the first time. It is. It is. It's the first time. Hello? Hello? Know who this is? No. It's Max. What do you want? Nothing. I want nothing. I just need to know she's happy. You're a sick man. You're right. I'm not well at all. Since you ask, I'll tell you. Yes, she's happy. Happier than before, in any case. As in when she was with me? Yes. That's right. That's cruel to say, after all I did for her. There's a lot you didn't do. Did you think about all you didn't do for her? What do you know about that, asshole? How do you know what I didn't do? How well do you know her? I know that we just made love. I didn't know it could be so sweet. So go ahead, call me dumbass, asshole, shithead, jerk, limp dick. Anything you want. I don't care. I'm in love. Go to hell. Bye. No, no. Wait, don't hang up. I'm the dumbass who couldn't make her happy, right? I'm sorry. There. All good? It's not all good. Nothing's good! Nothing's good about you, okay? So leave us alone. Okay, fine. Just tell me, who's the other guy? He's not a guy, he's my brother. Oh, yeah? Who is she with? You or him? Both. Bye. So? Ready to go, boys? You really think Dijon mustard is better in Dijon? Of course. -Why? -It didn't have to travel. Right. So if you want rillettes, you should buy them in Le Mans. Obviously. Sausages, in Strasbourg. Handkerchiefs, in Cholet. Bêtises, in Cambrai. Porcelain, in Limoges. Soap… in Marseille. -Oh, yeah, wait. -Calissons! What are calissons? Seriously? You don't know? No. Of course you've heard of calissons. -From where? -That's the problem, I forgot. -Lorraine, I think. -No. -Lorraine is for quiche. -Right. Shit, it's true. Quiche Lorraine. And bergamotes? I bet you don't know about bergamotes. Bergamotes… -Bergamotes from Nancy! -From Nancy! How do you know that? We just know, that's all. And thunder? From Brest! Wait, what's this? What's going on? What's this shit? What with all the barrels? Careful! Nico! Be careful! What the fuck do you think I'm doing? Watch out! Fuck! Shit. Shit! As luck would have it, it's a Citroën. Don't be like that. It's the trailer that was the problem. Okay, fine, but the trailer was still hitched to a Citroën, so… -So what? -So nothing, that's all. Not so fast, I keep missing the hole. Go on. Do you know the butter cookie game? No. You have to eat three butter cookies in under a minute. Who goes first? The older brother should do the honors. Fine. What's the prize? That's a surprise. Give me your watch. Please. You can eat them one by one or all three at the same time. But you're not allowed to drink, and after a minute, your mouth must be totally empty. -Got it? -Got it. -Ready? -Yes. Get set. Go. Ten. -Go faster. -Twenty. Thirty. You're doing great. Forty. -Forty-five. -Hush. I have the timer. Fifty. Done! Your time is… Your time is up. Not bad. But you lose. Your turn, Nicolas. Impossible. Don't tell me the time, it will stress me out. As you wish. Wait. -I'm ready. -Get set, go! Come on, Nico. -Concentrate. -He's had one already. You're doing great, Nico. You have half the time left. Go on, go on, go on. Just one more. Come on, Nico, you can do it! -Hurry up, Nico, it's almost over. -Done! Your time is up. -It's impossible. -No! Difficult, but not impossible. You're not going to try? Yes. Whenever you want. -Who does the timing? -Us both. Ready? Get set, go. Five. Ten. -Fifteen. -She already ate one. Twenty-five. -Thirty. -Thirty. Forty. NO SPECIAL EFFECTS Forty-five. Fifty, fifty-five. Done. How did you do it? There's a trick, you… There you go, I win. In other words… In other words? I win the right to make love with both of you at the same time. -Are you shocked? -No. It's not that. It's just… -We weren't expecting that. -Precisely. But… No. I mean… What's wrong with that? You're brothers, right? Come back, Nicolas! I was kidding. You were kidding? Of course I was. If you're not into it, we won't talk about it. Wait, were you kidding or not? Let's not talk about it anymore. You're such an odd girl sometimes. Yup. Super odd. Since I was little. Clément! -Hello. -Hello. Are you interested? Very much, we love it. -Do you live here? -No, just passing through. And are you familiar with it? With what? This. Well, of course we're familiar, -we're mechanics. -Really? -Yes! -Both of you? Yes, why? And you too? No, but I do like cars. Well, well, well. -Jacky Novion. -How do you do. Prudence. You block the back wheels with the hand brake. Got it? -I think so, yes. -Let me show you. Off we go. -See? -It's nothing complicated. -There. -That's good? Yes, that's good. Careful. Oh, no, hey. All right, your turn now. It's not dangerous, I hope? Technically, no. Wait until I say go. -Here? -Wait, wait. Go! See, you have a talent. Your brother is fearless. Prudence, I have something to tell you. No, never mind. Go on. What did you want to say? -It's not important. -Okay. If it's not important. Here goes. You're the best thing that's ever happened to us. That's not important? It is, but it's not exactly easy to say. It would have been a shame to keep it to yourself. Hello? Yeah. What? When? I see. Yes. What's wrong? It's Mom. She died. What? When? Day before yesterday. They couldn't reach us. She'll be buried tomorrow. Great job. I'll leave you to try on your own. -Really? -Yes, go on. Did you see that? I knew you had the skills. In any case, your brother, he's got the magic touch. What's up? What's with the faces? It's their mother. -She died. -Oh, shit. -When? -Just now. Where did she live? In Saint-Jean-de-Luz. We were going to visit. We have to stop Nico. No, no, no, no. No, let him continue. Fuck! What did the doctor say? Nothing. He was vague. You know how doctors are. -Even so, what did he say exactly? -Nothing, I told you. Mom had very low blood pressure, he was worried. That's it. -Did she fall? -I don't know! He didn't give any details. Don't worry, it'll be fine. Do you think she's happy? Of course. Thanks. You're welcome. We need to go home and see Mom. And you? I think I'll stay here for a bit. -And then? -I don't know. I'll have a look around. Eat dinner at a pizzeria, find a cheap hotel. Don't worry about me. But how will we find you? We'll always find each other. -Let's go, then. -No, wait. When the sun sets, we lay our heads on the sand, then when it disappears completely, we climb the sea wall, we'll see it a few seconds more. Not yet. Wait, wait. Wait for it. Wait for it. Go! There, there. Cool, huh? Okay, see you later? -Yes. -When? I told you, we'll find each other. Nicolas. -I wanted to tell you… -Forget it, I understand. You were always a bad liar. Have you decided? Yes. I'll get a four seasons and a glass of wine. -Red? -Red. Good choice, the four seasons is pretty tasty. What are you doing here? It's funny. I could have bet you'd say that. Not "I'm glad to see you," not "How are you," just "What are you doing here?" As if I weren't allowed to eat pizza in Saint-Jean-de-Luz. You know I've always loved pizza. You're alone. Where are your friends? It hurt me, you leaving just like that. It hurt me, but it also made me think. Are you surprised I can think? I love that look on your face. -Buon appetito. -Thank you. May I join you? That makes eight seasons on the table. Eight seasons add up to two years. What's two years? Go on, eat. It's good when it's hot. It's nice to eat. Go on, smile for me. No? Maybe later, then. At the cemetery earlier, I cried as if she'd been my mom. Thank you. What will you do now? Have lunch with an uncle, the one who lent us the suits. Sign some papers, then we'll head home. You don't want to stay a while? It's hard being sad when everyone around you is happy. Yeah. We'll return the car to Jacky, get our van back. I hope it's fixed. Then we'll slowly make our way back to Montbard. Are you coming? No. I'll stay here. Last night, at the pizzeria, I… They were looking for a waitress. I applied and… I got the job. Although, it may not be for long, because the pizzeria is for sale and… Never mind… We'll see. So… time to say goodbye, then? I'm sorry. I don't like goodbyes. Leave quickly, please. What does he want? Thank you. -Did you change your mind? -No. But I remembered I owe Nicolas something. You owe me something? Remember? We'll miss you. Take this. To remember me by. We don't need it. I mean, we'll think about you anyway. I can't believe we may never see her again. You don't know that. What do you mean? The sea's nice, but people can get tired of it.
