She's cheating on me. What makes you think that? I just know. I mean I smell it when she comes home late from work. You mean you literally smell... what? She smells too clean. You know, she smells like soap. I don't know. Is that ridiculous? What do you think? No. Have you asked her? So you' re not having an affair? No. Believe me I've had my chances and I've really thought about it and that makes me feel even guiltier, which is ironic. Why is that? Because he won't touch me. He's been through a lot. Don't you think he still cares about you? It just hurts. It really does. Well, yesterday I, uh, I got up and I actually thought about getting dressed and going into the office. You know, the idea actually appealed to me. That's good. It was about 7:00 in the morning, too, and that's the earliest I've gotten up in I don't even know when. The house is looking good, too. I'll probably be finished in a couple of weeks. It's looking pretty good. I've got to say I'm really proud, you know. Of course, if Emily and I can't work things out then everything else is bullshit anyway. Cured again. I just know I'm gonna find him one morning, sitting in his father's Eldorado, engine running... Gone. Tell me. What's he doing that's worrying you? I mean, he has moments when he manages to show some interest in something other than hammering nails or painting walls. Generally, though, he's morose. Sometimes violent. Violent? He hasn't really hurt me. He did grab me by the wrists pretty hard the other day though. That surprises me. You're always surprised. I don't know how he acts with you but from where I sit he's right on the edge. Sorry I'm late, honey. I went shopping after I saw Dr. Powers. I had to go to three different stores to find this pair of black leotards. How'd it go with Powers, hon? Usual stuff. My awful childhood, my terrible father. It was a good session, though. Well, good. Wall's almost done. Only have about 73 more to go. You look very nice. Look, uh, how much time do you have before you have to go to work? You've got all the spare time, Todd. I got the job. Okay. Todd, if you would sell this place we'd have enough time to do anything we want. We'd have enough money so I wouldn't have to be a cocktail waitress. Look, baby, I know how you feel, I really do. How could you know how I feel? You don't care if I run around half naked serving drinks to grabby stockbrokers? Of course it bothers me. But, I mean, it's not like it's a longshoreman's bar, you know? Grinders is a decent place. Oh, yeah, really decent. Look, the house is almost done. Oh, come on! And when it is, we'll have enough time to talk about staying or moving or whatever. We'll talk about anything you want to talk about. Come on. I need some time here, Em. Look, you grew up here. How much time do you need? Look, I promised I'd go back to the office when I'm ready. I promise you. But I need the time. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can say except I'm sorry. So am I. So what do you say? You got a little spare time for me? Pull it tighter. Oh, yeah, like that. Oh! Do you love me? I fuck you, don' t I? Never leave me? No, never. What? What? Where'd you go? I can't stop thinking about your husband. Just do me a favor, huh? Think about us. That's exactly what I'm doing. Let me out of this. Why doesn't the guy just give you a divorce? Jesus! I ask him all the time. I know, I know. He's just scared, you know? Everything just scares him. I've done a lot of things, but murder... Darcy, I'm going crazy, you know? He's destroying my life. The house alone is worth over a million. Emily, we don't got to do it. We don't need his money. Yes, we do. Let me see it. What's with you? Nothing. What? What? Come on... Come on. Aw, man, the cops are gonna be all over us. Jesus Christ, not now! Are you drunk? Are you? I had a couple of drinks just to calm down. Goddamn you! No one's gonna believe this. Look, he's on the edge. Everybody knows that. So what? Give me that. I'll do it. I'll do it. Em, hon, what are you... What are you doing? Todd, somebody's here. I was going to go check. Now? Oh, God! Who the hell could that be? I don't know but you'd better go down. Okay. Okay, honey. Wait here. Be careful. I will. What the fuck do we do now? Take the gun. Take it. Jesus Christ! Take the gun. Climb down the trellis. What? Climb down the trellis! Shit! Who's there? Take it easy, tough guy. Give up? Mmm-hmm. Berke! You should've taken me, sport. I've been driving all night. Oh! We tried to find you. Yeah, I got a few letters. So then you already knew? What, about dad? Yeah. Yeah. I tried to get back, man, but there was just nothing I could do, you know? It was six months ago, Berke. Oh, hi, Emily. Nice to see you, too. You here long? I just got here. Todd, be a sweetie and straighten up the room for Berke. Sure, Em. I got it. No, man, it's okay. I got it. I'll, uh, I'll see you two in the morning. Nothing changes. Dad would be glad that you're back. You never change either. We both know that's bullshit, right? So, uh, she got you doing the dishes, too? Only when we eat. Look, Berke, there's a lot going on between me and Emily that you don't know about, but we're working on it. Jesus! No! I don't feel like it, Todd. So anybody show up for the funeral? Yeah, lots of people. Where's he buried? Forest Lawn. He bought a plot for the whole family about three years ago, remember? Did you tell him? Tell me what? What? What? What's the big secret here? You pregnant, Todd or what? Right before dad died our business was not doing very well. The sales were down and dad died so suddenly. No excuses, Todd. Remember? Dr. Powers? You've got to tell him what happened. Um... I locked myself in the garage, and I started the car and just kind of sat back. You understand? Jesus, man, that's crazy. I know, I know. I mean, that's what my shrink says. Lucky for me though the car ran out of gas. And there's another reason. She's, uh... She's sleeping with someone else. I thought you said things were okay. I said that we were working on it. Enjoying yourself? It beats TV. Oh, what the hell. It's not like you haven't seen me before. Oh, gee, Emily, it looks like your ass is sagging. The hell it is. Nothing's changed. You're probably right. Okay, I'll bite. Meaning? Meaning, what are you doing to him? He did it to himself, remember? He worships you, you know, and you treat him like shit. I treat him just fine. Yeah. He's made you pretty damn comfortable, too. Berke, I am a cocktail waitress. If he would sell the goddamn house, we might be comfortable. If he was back at work, we might be comfortable. And if he would stand on his own goddamn feet we might be comfortable. Yeah, that's a lot of ifs. And if inheritances were community property things would be comfortable. C'est la vie. Up on the law are we? Look, if you're doing anything to hurt him... Stop. Or what? Go ahead. I won't feel it. I don't feel anything anymore. Even when I fuck your brother. Ah! One Halloween, I guess I was eight or nine, and I was dressed as a soldier. You know, in that camouflage fatigues, and the little rifle, the whole bit, and these two older kids were riding around the neighborhood on their bicycles throwing eggs, you know, Halloween. So one of them sees me and he just launches an egg right at my head. And it hits me smack right in the helmet. So of course I'm crying and I run home. Actually I was pretty terrified, and Berke's there, so I tell him what happened. He's just sitting there listening quietly. And then, the next night I come home and the kid who threw the egg and hit me is sitting there on the couch and he's got his arm in this cast, this huge cast, it goes all the way up to his shoulder, and the kid's father's there, too. I'll never forget being up in my room. I was in bed and downstairs I can hear Berke just getting reamed by my dad and by the kid's father. I think they grounded him for something like eight years, you know, or something like that. I know he was really stung by it, too, especially someone like Berke. But I also know he never regretted doing it. Even today when we talk about it he still has this little smile about it, you know, he's still glad that he did it. Do you remember how you felt? Pretty good, actually. Can you tell me why? Because revenge is sweet, you know. Yes, but you didn't exact this revenge, your brother did. Yeah, well, I guess I just felt that that was good enough for me. Sounds like you have a fiercely loyal brother. How do you feel about him being home again? Oh, it's great, you know. I mean, it's great having him back home again. Why wouldn't it be? Is that why you told me the story? I don't know. Was it? I just wonder if perhaps you want your brother to help you with your problems at home? With Emily? Well, what if he could? I mean, I don't see any harm in that, you know. You still haven't tried the direct approach. I think you should try that first. Ask her. Yeah, but what if she lies? Maybe she won't. She will. You can't be sure. Berke would make sure. What do you mean by that? I don't know. Looks like the sea air did wonders for your appetite. Bullshit. No, I mean it. You've filled out a little. That's called working out, not filling out. Oh, whatever. Yeah, whatever. Listen... Do... I'm sorry. Go ahead. What were you going to say? Do I make you uncomfortable? Hey. How'd it go? Great, cured again. If you ask me, shrink's are full of shit. You know, you sound just like dad when you say that. Why are we here? What's going on, Todd? Dad left me the house. He left Berke something, too. Your legacy. $24,000. From dad to you. Dad didn't leave me anything. Well, he left it for both of us. What the hell is this? A lot of money, what do you think? You mean to tell me this has been here the whole time? Well, yeah. Listen, you can't touch this. This is rainy day money. Well, wake up. It's raining, you son of a bitch! Can somebody open this, please? Look, I think you better hold onto it. I've got two keys here. Why don't you take one of the keys, okay? All right. Hi. Yeah. It's okay. I'll see you then. Excuse me, can we get sane service? Yeah, I'll get your waitress. Sometime today? Hey listen, you know, if you can spare the time you got some very thirsty customers back there. Look, just two minutes, okay? Can you cover for me? Yeah, like you did for me when I wanted to take off last Thursday? Forget it. Cinda, will you just lighten up? Huh? Just lighten up. Hey, Darcy, you know, if I were you I'd demand a recent blood test. Listen, forget about her. Listen to me. I'm serious about it, I'm serious. Goddamn it. What the fuck? What! Hey, watch it. Excuse me. Looks good. Thanks, man. It's getting there. Here, take this. Jesus, man. Where'd you get this? It's America, kid. Everybody's got the right. What's this for? I mean, do you realize what you just did? You gave a gun to a guy who tried to kill himself. My shrink would probably have some kind of Freudian shit fit. Scare her with it. You put that barrel to her lying head. Tell her if she goes out on you again you pull the trigger. Why? What are you talking about? Todd, the woman's screwing some guy. I'm sorry. Berke, when I told you that, you know, I didn't know. I mean, it was just a feeling, just a feeling I had. That's all. It's true. I followed her last night. Fuck, man! Who asked you to do that, huh? She's no good, man. She never was. I gotta get her back. Why? Well, then, you've got to do something. You can't let her screw you over like this. You've got to do something. I'll work on it. Yeah, sure. You know, I was reading in the paper today that there's this new movie out. It's kind of like an old fashioned love story. Apparently it's a three hankie job. I was thinking maybe the three of us could go down and maybe check it out. I mean, it's right down on the corner. So we can probably make an early show. What do you say, Berke? Nah, I'm not really in the mood. Well, how about you, hon? I mean, it's your only night off. Let's take advantage of it. I can't. I have to work. What do you mean? I promised Cinda I'd cover for her. You know, I really wanted to see you tonight. I can't believe that you just went and did this. Did what? Work? You two don't even get along and yet you're covering for her? That was last week. Well, hi there. Can I get you something? Is Emily working tonight? It's her night off. Her night off. Say, pal, that's $6.50. Get out of my way. I don't think you heard me. Hey, I'm talking to you. Bingo. Berke. Well, you've got a lot of balls, Emily. I'll give you that. No, you've got a lot of balls, man, busting in here like this. Get the fuck out before I call the cops. Just give it a rest, okay? Emily, get dressed. Stay put. Now you're way out of line, man. She's a big girl. She's not even your wife. So fucking what? Emily, get your clothes and say goodbye, now. And don't you ever try to see her again, you understand me, you piece of shit? Look, put the gun down. We can talk this whole thing out. Please, Berke, put the gun down. Put the gun down, Berke. What're you doing? What's it look like, asshole? No! No! Oh, my God! I don't want to die. Please. Please what? Please. Goddamnit! Oh, fuck! All right, go get some trash bags and some towels. What makes you think I won't go to the cops? Because I'll kill you. Fuck. Are you done? Then help. Come on, open it. Hurry up. All right. Get in your car and follow me. Now. He's awake. Go up there and keep him busy. What? Well, you want him to see this? Get going. Go. Go. Did I wake you? No, no, not really, honey. I'm sorry. They kept me late tonight. Babe, I think I'm gonna get some water. No, no, no, stay here. Why? Lie down. What are you... What are you doing? Shh. Close your eyes. What's going on? I thought I heard somebody breaking in. It was me goddamn it. You tried to kill me, you fucking psycho. Jesus, Berke. I'm sorry, it was dark. What the hell is she doing up at this hour anyway? You could have killed her, you idiot. You okay, honey? Don't come down here. Just go to bed. I'll be up soon, okay? What were you doing down there? Look, just leave me the fuck alone! I'm sorry. Just go to bed, okay? You all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Okay. Hello? Is anybody here? Is anybody here? We're not open yet. Yeah, well, I'm looking for somebody. Aren't we all. Yeah, well, some of us have better luck than others. What's up? Do you know him? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah? Liquid lips. I'm sorry. It's all right. Is he a friend of yours? Yeah, well, I used to think he was. Mmm. Well, he was in here last week. That's the last time I saw him, last week. You know him? You know, I do know a woman that he's left with a couple of times before. She works here. Why don't I give you her home address. Great. You're very tense. Now he thinks I'm having an affair with Berke. What makes him think that? There's a history. Look, Berke and I were together years ago, we had a thing, but that was it. It didn't last. Although I know he wishes it would've. Don't you think that could be adding fuel to the fire? I can't change the past. Yes, but you can make it irrelevant. You don't think I'm trying to help? I didn't say that. Don't you think Todd's state of mind is obvious? Did he tell you about his latest little episode? I'm not sure. What? He blew up again. Smashed a vase. I'm afraid of him. I keep wondering if I'm safe. Hey! Hi. Hi. I'm Adele. Adele Rogers. Hi, I'm... Hold on a second. Todd Morrow. Nice job. Oh, thanks. What are you doing? I'm laying a sprinkler system actually. I think that's really important, you know, for a man to be good with his hands. Can I help you with anything? Yes, I'm looking for, um, an Emily Morrow? Is this her house? Yes, it is. Gee, she must serve one hell of a drink. I'm sorry. Well, it's kind of a long story, you know. I got time. Okay. I inherited it. Would you step to... Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. End of story. That's really cute. You're a cute rich guy. That's almost as good as being excellent with your hands. So, um, is she here? No, she's not. No? She's supposed to be, but I don't know where she is. What do you want to speak to my wife about? Oh, to... It's a mutual friend. You know, do you think maybe I could get a drink? I'm just parched. Uh... You look like you could use one yourself. All right. So that's why I took the bus out here and the first guy I met was this pimp, his name was Jules. And I figured, you know, if I was ever gonna hook it would not be for a lowlife scum like him, you know. No class. So then... I started to do telephone sales. That's when you wake up really early in the morning like 6:00 or 5:00 and you sell people, you try to sell them all across the country fifty reams of computer paper, and, oh, that's such a drag. And that's when I started my acting class and became another young hopeful in the Dirty Orange. Talk about banging your head against a wall. Um, then the next thing is I met Darcy. Darcy Daniels. My next door neighbor. That's the mutual friend, right? Yeah. What's his story? Well, girl meets boy next door. Girl gives boy 500 bucks. Girl loses boy and I guess the 500 bucks. Probably got tooted it up his nose. Boy, I find the assholes. So, Todd, you do this all yourself? Oh, yeah. It's great therapy. You buy this stuff? No, it belonged to my parents. You know, I've really got great taste. I could be your interior decorator. Really? Mmm-hmm. Well, I'll think about it. No, you will not. I don't know, maybe I will. What the hell happened to you guys? What's with you? What do you mean, what's with me? I want to know where you were. I was worried. You didn't say we were having company, Todd. Oh, I'm not exactly company. Well, then, exactly who are you? - Oh, I'm sorry, honey. - This is Adele Rogers. And that's my wife, Emily and my brother Berke. Oh, you guys don't look at all like brothers. Oh, I know, my dad always said that Berke strongly resembled our milkman. Oh, honey, Adele's here to see you. I better put these things away. You wanted to see me? Why? Uh... Oh, honey, apparently you know someone named Darcy? Yeah, Darcy. Darcy Daniels. He's my next door neighbor. Okay, he's my boyfriend and he's missing. And... At least I think he is. He's disappeared. Do you know him? No, no, why are you asking me? Well, a waitress down at Grinder's, she thought you knew him. I know lots of guys that come into the bar. I don't necessarily know where they go after they leave. I'm sorry, but... I don't know, Cinda said she thought he was a friend of yours or something. Was his name Darcy? Yeah, Darcy Daniels. You know, I never even asked him his name. He walked me to my car one night. And he was a perfect gentleman. That doesn't sound like the Darcy I know. Maybe it depends on the woman. Yeah. So, you don't know? No, but I hope you find him. Thanks. Uh, if you see him, will you give me a call? Todd, think about my offer, okay? I've got great taste. All right. Um... Bye. Bye. Offer? Oh, to decorate the house. How can you let a wacko like that in this house? I thought what she had to say was pretty interesting. Todd, the woman practically accused me of having an affair with this guy. I heard. Yeah, and? What are you thinking, Todd? Hey... I love you. Come here. His name is Darcy. Who? The guy who was fucking my wife. I also met this woman, Adele. Darcy was screwing her, too. Real discriminating guy. Well, anyway, guess what? He's missing. I don't understand. I was right and you were wrong. Get it? I mean, it's so painfully clear that you don't understand what's going on. This is so useless. Todd, Emily says that she loves you and that she's been faithful to you. She says that she's been trying to help you. From what I've heard I have to go with that. Emily says? Well, it's no wonder you have trouble believing me. You've taken her side from the start! Did it ever occur to you maybe, just maybe she might be lying? No, huh? So much for objectivity, huh? I try to be objective. The truth is everything to me. Otherwise I'd be useless to you. You know, you're always talking about wanting the truth. You want to hear the truth? Okay. I'll get you the fucking truth. What are you doing in here? Putting your laundry away. We have to talk. About what? Aren't you a little worried about that Adele? She's just on a fishing trip. Berke, we could both go to jail! Jail's not so bad. You've been out at sea too long. What do you want me to do? You want me to kill her? It should be easy for you. Friend, we understand not one another. I am too courtly and thou art too cunning. At who's request do these men play? Todd! - That's to 't indeed, sir. - Marry, sir, at the request... Hi. Glad you made it. Ass end of nowhere equity waver Shakespeare shit, but it's acting. I play Helen of Troy. You sure look like the real thing to me. Oh, yeah, right. Helen of Troy. The little slut starts the whole fucking Trojan War and Shakespeare gives her one lousy scene. Spare me to you, M'Lord... I'm on. And to this fair company, fair desires, in all fair measure, fairly guide them. Especially to you, fair queen. Fair thoughts be your fair pillow. Let thy song be love. This love will, undo us all. O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid! And that breeds hot blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love. Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty gives us more palm in beauty than we have. Yea, overshines ourself. Sweet, above thought I love thee. Let's eat. Come on, it was fine. You want some broccoli? No, thanks. I want to talk to you about Darcy. Oh, don't look so serious all the time. You'll get little frown lines and you'll look old before your time and luscious little tidbits like moi won't be considering a night of safe sex with you. What are you talking about? Okay, so you're married. But, you see, I don't sleep with guys in show business, so when I meet a nice guy I don't like to waste time. I see. So you think I'm a nice guy. Is that it? Yeah, probably too nice. Don't you want to find Darcy? I mean, don't you care where your money is? $500 was a cheap lesson, Todd. End of subject. I don't understand why you're so reluctant to talk about him. Why don't you ask your brother? Can I get you guys anything else? No, I'm fine. You, sir? No, I'm fine, thanks. Berke? What does he have to do with it? Because I saw him. I saw him at Darcy's place the day before Darcy disappeared. You saw my brother over at Darcy's house? Yeah, there's bad karma on that guy, man. I also, I also saw him at Grinder's the next night. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. He made a mud puddle out of some bouncer that works there. Yeah, that sounds like Berke. Guy like that is capable of anything. Am I right? Oh, it's just a big joke. Berke, I can't keep this up. Keep what up? The good wife game. Oh, you're doing pretty good. At least Todd thinks so. This can't last. Sooner or later he's going to realize it. Todd said you two are working at your marriage. Work harder. I don't love him. I love you. No, you don't. Yes, I do. Let's just leave. We've got plenty of money. Shh. How long, Berke? How long can I keep this up? Does till death do us part ring any bells? It's all these channels. There's never anything decent on. Sorry it's little, messy, but what can you do? Hey, what did you mean about it being a joke? What? You know, back at the cafe. You said you thought this whole thing was a big joke. What did you mean? Oh, the Adele Rogers theory of life as we know it. You know, it's kind of like that play I'm in, you know, that's all life really is about is sex and money. Do you have any rubbers? I think I should probably go. Todd! Todd, don't. Please. I'm just a little nervous, that's all. Could you sit down? Because I need to talk to you about something. Okay, I'm not exactly sure how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it. Todd, I think Emily, uh, is planning on having you killed. What? Listen to me. Darcy really had a lot of trouble keeping his mouth shut, especially when he had a few. And towards the end he was getting real nervous and he was getting blitzed a lot. Jesus. I'm talking like he's dead or something. Anyway, one night he got really juiced, he let it kind of slip he was seeing this married woman, really kinky married woman. I'd kicked him in the nuts really hard. Naturally he got my drift. He said he'd pay my 500 bucks back as soon as they got hold of the husband's money. Pretty dirty business, huh? See, I don't think they were expecting to have the husband around to watch them spend it. I sure can pick them. So your boyfriend told you this, right? Yeah. Well, that doesn't mean that it was Emily. The money was tied up in some big old house in Hancock Park. Husband wouldn't sell it. Was there any particular reason why you didn't go to the police? Yeah, I mean, it was kind of an iffy thing to go to the police with. I mean, he disappeared. Then I meet you guys and it all starts to make sense. I was gonna call you. Poor baby. You know, I don't even know why I should be surprised. No matter how bad things might be at home, no one expects to get killed for it. For God's sake, stop. Let's get out of here. You don' t believe me, you think I'm nuts. I believe you. Let's go. You want proof, I'll give you proof. Look, look at it. Hey. Wake up. What? What? What? Wake up. Come on. We're going to my house. Okay. Do you really think that Darcy's body is under here? Look, this is the only way to find out. Put the flashlight over there. Shine the light over there. Over there. It's blood. I think it's blood. Well, make sure. Guess again. Look! Oh! Jesus Christ! God. Jesus. Fuck. Some fucking family you have. Oh, God. I've got to get out of here. Where are you going? Just leave me alone! Oh, shit. What are you doing out here? Thinking. About what? Love. Love, huh? Big topic, but what a waste of time. Yeah, I guess so. Where were you last night? I went to see Adele Rogers. You know what she told me? She told me that Emily and this fucking guy, Darcy, were planning on killing me. No. Don't say no, man. No, I don't believe you. What do you mean you don' t believe me? I know. They were trying to fucking kill me. All Emily wanted was the money. But can you believe that? I mean, when it comes down to it, all she had to fucking do was ask. She's fucked up, man. She's sick. You ought to just get rid of her. Just get rid of her? Yeah. That's your solution? That's what I should do? Yeah. She's a fucking loser. Get rid of her, man. Yeah, just like you did to Darcy, right? Look, whatever I did, I did for you. Okay? No, man, I don't think so. What the hell's that supposed to mean? You didn't do it for me. You did it for yourself. Not for me. Man, you don't get it, do you? I will do anything for you. Yeah, you know what happens? I end up owing you for the rest of my fucking life. Bullshit! I'm your brother, man. I'm your blood. Who else is there to take care of you? Yeah, well, you know, I think I can handle it, okay? How? By sucking on a tailpipe? That's your way? Just stay out of it, all right? Just do me a favor and stay the fuck out of it, all right? I'm getting out of here. Just don't forget to top off your tank next time, huh? You know, you were a fuck up when you were a kid and you're still a fuckup. Get up! What? I warned you. I didn't do anything! Yeah? You were going to though, weren't you? You were going to kill him. If I wanted to he'd be dead already. You no good bitch. Give me one good reason not to squeeze the worthless life out of you. I love you, Berke. You're so full of shit. How about a little mini session, huh? A little quickie? Ready? Go! What's happened? I finally got it. Don't you see? Emily wanted my money and she was ready to kill me to get it. Todd, you're under a lot of stress. What's the matter? Afraid I'm going to kill myself? Of course not. What makes you say such a thing? How the fuck could you do this to me? By the way, about Emily's imaginary lover? Here's a little souvenir for you. Yes, police please. Emily? Yes, this is Terrence Powers. I need to see you immediately. It's very important. Yes. Okay. Oh, shit. Who is it? It's me, Todd. Open up. Where've you been? I've been trying to get in touch with you all day. I had the phone off the hook. I was trying to sleep. No luck. But that's to be expected when one finds a dead body. You haven't told anyone, have you? No. Look, I don't want you to say anything, okay? For my sake or for my brother's. Okay, Todd, what am I supposed to do? Don't do anything. Just lay low until everything settles. Come on, help me out here, Adele. I've been thinking a lot about it, Todd, and I can help you out if you help me out. Well, what do you need? I'm kind of broke right now. I could use a loan. How much? Mmm. Ten grand. $10,000? Are you kidding me? You know, I think it's very reasonable considering what I've been through. Well, what if I can't get it? Todd, please, say yes. Please. All right, you've got it. Thanks for everything. I came as soon as I could. What's wrong? Sit down. Jesus! This is Darcy's finger, isn't it? Who? Don't lie to me anymore. You know what you need? A good shrink! Either you talk to me or I call the police. Why haven't you called them already? I'm not sure. Maybe I should have. But you didn't. What do you want to know? Now I know about you and Darcy, I'd like to know why. He was, uh, he was new and different. He showed a lot of interest. And Berke stopped the affair? Berke found us together. He, uh... He beat Darcy up and then he cut off his finger and told him to stay as far away from me as he could or he'd slice off something else. Darcy went. So it's all over? I'm not trying to judge you. I just want you to tell me the truth. Berke was going to hurt me, too. So I fucked him. It's the only way I know. All those lies. Look, I'm sorry. I admire you. You didn't judge me. You treated me like a person. I didn't want you to think I was what I am. You were also lying to me about Todd's mental condition, weren't you? He wanted to kill himself. Maybe in the beginning. But our sessions together were good. He wasn't morose or violent. He never talked to me about suicide. You sabotaged him using me. Please... ...help me! I'll do anything you want. Please. I'd be an even bigger fool if I let you use me again. Who are you calling? Put that down! I've asked you to help me. I want the police. Where are you going? Anywhere. Take me with you. You gotta be fucking kidding. No! Oh, no, you prick. I earned that money. You're not... Berke! Give me the gun. You want it? You want to kill me? You want to fuck me. That's why you're leaving. You've already fucked your brother's wife. So what does it matter? So do it. God! Hi, honey, is dinner ready yet? Stop it! Stop it! Stay down! Stay down! Get off me. I'm sorry. Fuck you. Get the hell out now. Todd? I said get out now! You sure you want to do this? I wouldn' t have it any other way. Cured again. Hi. You okay? Uh, it's... It's all right. I don't have the money. I don't want your money, Todd. I... I'm not a dirty person. Do you hear me? Jeez! Oh, jeez! I'm sorry. I finally meet some guy I care about and I blackmail him. I'm sorry. I was wrong, okay? Please, can I come in? No, I don't think that's a good idea. I mean, there is more to life than sex or money isn't there, Todd? There has to be. Look, this just isn't a good time, you know? Maybe sane other time. Goodbye, Adele. I want to get away from here. As far as we can. You ever been to Tahiti? No. We can go there. You're dreaming. Yeah, well, we can do anything we want. I wanted everything to be all right. That's what I wanted. Everything is all right. No. You went too far. Me? What about you? It's all gonna catch up to us, you know that? Slow down, Berke. What are you doing, Berke? Saving everybody a lot of trouble. No! No! What are you doing! No! No! Look at this place. Maybe I should get a decorator.
