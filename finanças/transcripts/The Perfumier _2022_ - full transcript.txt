NETFLIX PRESENTS This story begins in the darkness. It is about beauty and savagery, BASED ON THEMATIC ELEMENTS OF THE NOVEL PERFUME: THE STORY OF A MURDERER about the search for happiness and the price for it. I'm telling it to you because it is my story. Our story. But this is also the story of a murderer. I had never experienced what it is, happiness. It seemed as fleeting to me as a scent. As if only those who had the sense for it could experience it. I did not have that sense, a sense for the scent of things and people. I could see them, hear them, touch them, but I could not smell them. An invisible wall separated me from them. It was the sole reason that I risked everything to tear down that wall. Hey, stop, please! Come on, Lori. Hurry, hurry, hurry! - Come on in. - Thanks for stopping. Just trash and nasty people. I haven't been eating or sleeping. It's awful. I even forgot to feed my dog. The big city makes people sick. I know... I talk a lot. You tell me something. I'm starting a new job. Mm, cool. Like, out in the country? All organic, with animals and stuff? Police. Here, have some fruit. Thank you. The scent of this... is how every day of life should be. I still remember thinking this move could be the beginning of so much more. Maybe Juro would be more than an affair. Maybe he'll see me and stay. - You're sure? This is your vibe? - Yeah. I didn't know if this was already the happiness I was so hoping for, or just the closest I could come to happiness. You should come to the party. I don't like my picture taken. Guys! Juro, we're close. No, seriously... Come here. No, you go in the middle. Three, two, one! - Protect and serve! - One more time. Sexy! You sure settled in fast. Any issues, just talk to me, all right? I'm in charge here now. Juro and you met when you were looking for an apartment, that right? - Yep. - You two seem so... I don't know... It's good! Enjoy it! - Cheers. - Cheers! This is 70% sugar, strawberries, tangerines, and schnapps. Whoa! That's impressive. I've never seen anyone who can down this stuff like that. Whoo! Whoo! Come in! Come in! Juro gave me a feeling that was new to me. And I wanted to believe in that feeling. Do I smell? Mm-hmm. You have to tell me. Hey, you have to tell me, okay? I wish I knew what your sweat smelled like. Mmm... It smells like... - What? - Lilies of the valley. Lilies of the valley! It would definitely have a little garden, with flowers and trees. I'd like a house like that. With you. Mm-mm. - Rosa? - Juro, hey. Where are you? The kids were just saying how they missed you. I thought I'd reach out. I had no idea what was in store for us. That our story would be inescapably connected to the story of the perfumer. Dorian. I took you in. I passed on my expertise. It's all because of me that you have all your knowledge. Now get back to work this instant! You can keep my formulas. A fair deal. What is this? This formula, it's... What do you intend to do with these girls? To create something that is greater than the human will. You can't do this. No one should ever go that far. A love perfume. That's impossible. Dorian... Dorian... Dorian's journey was also a new beginning. He too was searching for something. He had learned to preserve the fleeting soul of things, their scent Aw, look at the ball, baby. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Wave goodbye! He believed he had also found a formula for the human soul. All he needed now was an accomplice. Hey, freak Ha! Rex. I'm coming back. You're coming home? After all this time? Yes. We'll see each other soon. This is... fantastic! We'll do it like before, only better. What should I do? I can do anything. The world will be more beautiful. And so our paths crossed. Hey. We can't go down yet. It hasn't been secured. Sunny? Wait. Sunny, are you coming? I picked her up on my drive up here. Um... Targeted incisions. They removed... the sweat glands in the armpits and pubic area. The injuries aren't vaginal. So a sex crime can... Can be ruled out in this case. More and more young women were found, all with the same injuries. It wasn't hard to guess what the motive for these murders was. It was about skin and hair, about the human scent and the pheromones it contains. All the evidence led to one crime scene. We are now setting up a special "Bunker Murders" unit. We have loads of fingerprints and DNA. Good. Yeah, and please say hi to the kids, all right? Yeah. Talk soon. There was a prime suspect, Carlotta König, known as Rex. I followed her. For days. To no avail. They've put an end to any surveillance. Completely. Starting tomorrow. What? - We came up with nothing. - That's such bullshit. Rex was in the vicinity of where they found these bodies. And these locations were remote. And this was more than once, Juro. Let's go out for a drink. I can't. I have to finish these reports. Um... I, um... Rosa. She wants me back. Uh... These last months with you, Sunny, they... They were amazing. But... I miss my family. I'm sorry. And so our romance had ended, as suddenly as it began. I was all alone. Just like this lonely boy. A boy that needed someone to look after him. - Hi, I'm Stefan. - Stefan. Yeah. I remember. From next door. I... I was wondering if, um... If you could, um... Does he want beer or wine? Your father. Both. Come in. Do you want a pizza? Work was the only thing that kept my mind off Juro. I decided to tail Rex. Wherever she went, however long it took. Eventually she'd give me a lead. It's ready. You can try it out, Rex. There was an invisible lead, one I couldn't decipher. Unwittingly, I had gotten very close to the perfumer. Tina, it's me. I need backup here. Did you tell Tina where you were going? This is on me. Something's on fire. No! You can't destroy it. It's perfect! Give it to me, you lunatic! It is! It is! It's wonderful! It's wonderful! Police! You have to get out of here. Is anyone else inside? - Is anyone else inside? - Dorian. Ah! Sunny! He's trying to destroy it! This is the police. We're coming in. More! Police! I want more! I couldn't smell it, but I could sense the power emanating from it. Sunny, careful. There's a second suspect named "Dorian." Juro, stop! We have to find the other suspect. This formula wasn't the scent that Dorian had wanted to create. Failure. All of it. It's not love. Just sex. With Rex's arrest, the case was closed. But it wasn't solved. ...and is being held in a physiatrist ward. We are conducting a county-wide scale search for a second suspect... I didn't tell anyone what I had found in the lab. I wanted to keep that to myself. We suspect the murders of the young women may have something to do with a, uh... so-called love perfume that the suspects were apparently attempting to create. Of course, we have yet to find anything of that nature. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow then. This is crazy, huh? Please get out, Juro. Get out. Juro came back to me. Ouch. And it almost felt as if... ...he'd done it out of love. But it wasn't the same anymore. - Hi. - Hey. I found this in storage. It's a beach tent. When I was young we used it to camp. It's not the only thing... I was deceiving Juro. But also myself. But then something happened that changed everything. Something I had wanted the most and also feared the most at the same time. You happened. Mm. - It's good. - Yeah? Mm-hmm. Could use a little salt and pepper. Hmm. How are the kids? With all the back and forth? Here. Look. Is this your dream house or what? Needs a renovation, - but it's not crazy expensive. - Oh, God. It's a steal for this area. It really is my dream. Hm? I have something to tell you. It's Rosa. Lilly had a fall. They're at the hospital. Hopefully it's nothing too serious, but... I should go. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Don't worry. It's all right. - Oh. What did you want to tell me? - Nothing. It's fine. SENSE OF SMELL IN MOTHERS "Mothers could unfailingly distinguish their baby's unique scent." "Serotonin and oxytocin create a one of a kind connection." ANOSMIA - LOSING YOUR SENSE OF SMELL "A baby's smell is a form of chemical communication between mother and child." I tried to picture what it would be like. But I felt... nothing. And that scared me. Because unlike any other animal, unlike any normal mother in the world... I wouldn't smell you. Hey! - Look at me! - I can't do this anymore! Get back here! Hey. Everything okay? I wouldn't get booze for him. Hey... I'm almost free from him. I thought about my own childhood. He can't help it. - Yes, he can! - He's sick. I wondered if it was better not to be a mother at all... - Please. - ...then to be a bad one. - Please. - Stefan? He's staying over at my place. A child is a sacred gift, you asshole! Come on. Let's go. But the fear came back and haunted me in my dreams. It led me back onto the trail of the perfumer, and I realized that I needed his help. If anyone had the power to teach me how to smell, it was him. I went back to the place where Rex killed the girls. Something told me that Dorian was hiding here. Hey! Hello? You're using my perfume. It works for sex. Not for love. Here. Your leg needs to be treated. I'll help you up. Yeah. Your scent. A pearl. Yes. Are you arresting me? Teach me how to smell again. Then you'll set me free? It is possible. You'll have to get me some scents in order to help you. We had made a pact. Dorian would be my teacher. And I would protect him. I'm not feeling well. I'm out sick. Cedar wood. Too little ammonia. This ox blood is poor quality. That isn't real thyme, it's artificial. I got you a new bandage. I told you the things I need are specific. Exact, precise. That's everything. The pepper's good. The fennel too. We couldn't trust each other. The parsley will do. I had searched for a substance, unnoticeable, odorless, toxic. I was as much prepared for the worst, as I was for a miracle. It'll work for the task at hand. Please bring the rest down. I'll get started. Why do you need all this stuff for? For your smell training. I wrote everything down for you while you were away. Read all of it. Then you'll be prepared. We'll start in the morning. Now go get some rest. "Odorant molecules are like tiny dust particles." "You have to imagine them like colorful butterflies." "Your body needs to be ready for it." "There are 20 million olfactory cells ready to awaken." Dorian returned to his world of scents. I could tell he had something else planned. Did you sleep well? It's tasty. Not easy for someone who can't smell. You cook like this for him too? I mean the father of your child. Seventh. No, it's the eighth week. Your scent will be inherited by them. Just teach me how to smell. I need to know more or I can't help you. What do you want me to do? Here. These are the six basic scents. All smells that exist are just a combination of these. Try them. Please. Nothing? And the others? Flowery. Fruity. Resinous. Smell every morning and night. Every day. Intentionally. Until you start to feel that something is changing. Begin your training now. If you can no longer hear anything... cannot see anything... then all that remains is touch, and smell. I concentrated all my perceptive power on rediscovering my sense of smell... The scent and the taste of things. I practiced. Every day anew. Again and again. Until I really believed something had changed. Good evening. How was your day? Well? Has anything changed? How did you lose your sense of smell? Tell me about it. It was winter. I had a cold. How old were you? I was seven. And your parents? My father had... already left. - And my mother... - They neglected you. She didn't take care of me. My cold got worse. Smells are feelings. Memories. You were seven years old. All your scents and smells you perceived before that moment, imprinted upon your brain forever. It cannot be erased. The smell of childhood. That's the key. You have to go back to that. This is totally insane. It's over. It doesn't work. You can't do it. We're all helpless as children. They do with you as they please. My father was a pastor here. And he thought I was a demon, same as you. But that's not true. We have this much in common. What happened to us as children... ...we can't change that anymore. Thank you for the inspiration. Before leaving the bunker, Dorian created three scents. Two of them were to give him strength, to help him achieve his ultimate goal- creating the formula for the perfume of love. The third scent, however, was something else. It was a protective shield Dorian wore everywhere he went. This morning, Carlotta König, aka Rex, broke out of the forensic psychiatry unit. During morning lockup a guard went into her cell. He said, and I quote, "I looked at her. My heart recoiled inside me." "It became difficult to breathe and I was overcome with panic attacks." Then, for no apparent reason, he collapsed and König simply walked out of the psychiatric unit. Then there's this. This vial was found in her cell. The day before she was visited by someone who used a forged ID to get past personnel. We think he snuck in the vile somehow. We don't know if Dorian was behind this. When she was young, König was some sort of mathematical genius. She skipped several grades. Then had an accident where they rebuilt her cranium with a titanium plate on top. Her crimes are well-known. She cut the apocrine sweat glands out of her victims. The center of the human essence. I didn't know how long I had been lying there. I could sense that you were okay. My fall had changed something. Yeah. Ah! The invisible wall had vanished. But with the smell, memories returned, and a curiosity. She's alive. It all worked out, master. Thanks for getting me out. Cheesy, unwashed, too much garlic. Damn, I'm itchy. Those are side effects from the perfume. Oh yeah? The sex perfume? Somebody must have it. It's gotta be around, right? Yeah. I know who has it. Bah! Then who? I have to have it back. No, we'll make a new one. A better one. But I want the old one. Sexy sex! Rex, someone gave me new inspiration. A woman. The new one will be delicate... a thousand colors. It won't be anything like the first attempt. They will love us. L'amour. The formula has to be perfect. The exact composition. In the temple. And then I'll tell you who has the old perfume. Mm. Don't go! It won't happen again. Stefan! Wait! Since when can you smell again? Since I've been pregnant. We moved into the old country house that Juro had found for us. It could have been wonderful, without the lie that both kept us together, and separated us. I knew it couldn't go on like this much longer. INVESTIGATORS INTENSIFY SEARCH ...FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY St. Alphons' rectory? Sunny Valentin. I called earlier. This is about an appointment with Father Abel Welsch. - Yes, like I said, he's sick. - Yes, I know he's not well. I just want to speak to him about his son Dorian. I'll be brief. One second. Let me see if he's available. Thank you. Thanks. I'll wait. Hey! Wow. Hey, there. It's so nice to see you. Sorry, he's unavailable right now. You two are happy, huh? Right, then I'll hear from him when he has time. Yes, we'll be in touch to make an appointment, if necessary. - Yeah, Good. Good, thanks. Bye, - Till then. Hi Juro, I wanted to surprise you. How are you? It's beautiful here. I had been going nonstop, so it's been nice getting a break from work. I'll be right back. I was looking for clues in Dorian's past that would bring me closer to him. Dorian's birth name was Noah. The stench was truly awful. No one wanted to be near him. Even his mother found it hard. He scared people. At some point he understood that it had to do with how he smelled. Pretty soon, he wanted to create a human scent for himself. And... And this older classmate, this girl nobody liked, Rex, she helped him do it. The African church had just sent me a small chimpanzee. Move, Rex. Faster, faster! We'll save it, Rex. They wanted to extract its scent from it, because it was so close to a human's. It was sinful. A daemon possessed my child. I wanted to help him. - No! - His nose. - His nose! - Please don't! - Calm. Nice and calm. No. - Dad. I couldn't stop him. No one can. Love. It... It smells of... Wrong! PEARL Who is this woman from the bunker? And this pearl? What is with this new formula? What does this woman have to do with it? And who has the old perfume now? Enough! I'll tell you when I'm ready. I... I didn't want to... It's so cold. I want to get out of here. It must be right this time. It has to be exact. There's only here. Only here can it be found. In the temple. And I'm not done yet. I only have the beginning. But can't you finish the formula over there? Everything is ready in the factory. The factory works for me. Find me the material. Are we starting? We're producing? Yes, I can taste the scent already. I finally got to the place where everything began. PEARL Thank you for the inspiration. Beautiful, beautiful material. I sent Dorian a sign. I wanted him to know I was looking for him. - I'll tell you who has it. - Who? She burned down the temple. She stole the perfume from the lab. She should pay for that. Juro? Where is it? You have it. I know it. Give it to me now. I have to have it all for myself. Go on. Give it to me. Come on now. Shit! I know it's here! Show me where you've hid it! Okay. Let's be real. You can't keep it, you know? Huh. Look, this carves up the material. A measured procedure. And then stirring. Stirring, stirring. Boiling until Dorian is ready. Now talk. Do it. Do it for your shit baby. Give it to me. Please, give it to me. I have nothing else. I need it a lot more than you. Let it go. Let it go. Please. Sunny. Come with me! Any evidence in the yard? CSI! I need a DNA analysis. Talk to the neighbors? None of this makes any sense. Crazy! Hi. Good thing Juro called us. There's nothing down here either. You looked everywhere? Come here. Carlotta König's fingerprints are all over inside the house. She was here. Yes, when I... ...got home yesterday, um... They scoured the house, and then... No idea, suddenly I was out. Blackout? Mm-hmm. We found something. A five-liter pool of blood on the road, and we know it was König's blood type. The titanium plate from her skull was found in a ditch. But we haven't found a body. Forensics has finished downstairs. You can use your things again. I'm just going to have a look around. Hm. What's going on here? Sunny is acting strange. - Are you taking some kind of drugs? - What? Of course not. Juro, you have a family. Two children and a pregnant girlfriend. Did you sleep over at Rosa's? Yeah, I... You can't have two women. Why are you doing this? You're the most reliable person I know. Now you're all over the place. I know. It scares the shit out of me. Tina, I, I... I think I'm... I think I'm going insane. Take a deep breath. I had to let Juro go. Juro, Look at me. Take a deep breath. It was the best thing for all of us. Sorry, I can't eat anything. You have to go back to your family. I, uh... Sunny? Dorian and I had both lost our footing. We were left to our own devices. I saw what happened to Rex on the news. I can't do it without her. It is the harvesting, cutting the skin of the material. I can't possibly do it. You once told me about a very similar experience. Please send me a reply. In his desperation, Dorian turned to a perfumer that he admired. But what he painfully longed for, was the inspiration to finish his formula. He needed me for that. I forced myself to bury the last drops of the perfume. I've waiting for you. We've both hurt one another. But you need my perfume. And I need you to complete my formula. Never. You do. This was buried in front of your house. I need you to be my muse again. My inspiration. You'll be happy, trust me. Mmm... Don't be afraid. Everything will be fine. What is it? You're cold. - No. - You're cold. It's stronger than your will. You can't do it. You can't do it. What is it? - How can you... - It's fine. How can you create love if you don't know how to love? I can't help you. You don't even know what you're trying to create. Asshole! True love can never be forced. When it does arrive, it's easy. - So I took it. - Wow. Very cool. Call me Jackie, yeah? Fellow runaway? Mm-hmm. The perfumer Dorian was wanting to meet was Mortiz De Vries. He also searched tirelessly to find a formula for a perfume of love. The pearl. Is that your secret? So you got my emails then? - I brought something for you. - That there? - What is this? - What is the pearl? How does it open? I asked you first. The pearl is the last element. The heart of it all. How does it open? What is this? La machine d'amour. How does it work, this machine? It extracts the body's scent through its pores. Without a trace. No incisions. A vacuum. Yes, a vacuum. The knife is the problem. By our first touch, we have desecrated its uniqueness. Cut into this? We've destroyed it entirely. The problem is all the violence, the influence you've left behind while obtaining it. And this machine can solve all your problems. What is the pearl? You're doubtful. I'm not a natural talent. I taught myself most of what I know. There are dark things inside my mind. Oh, the darkness. Don't be too scared. What you need... is a little levity. Heavy minds cannot fly. This makes you a thousand times more sensitive to all the scents in the world. The perfume slowly lost its power over me. So you don't want to tell me what the pearl is. Well, isn't that great... Le beaux jours sont finis. If I don't know what love is because I've never experienced it, can I create the perfume? What's up with love and people? I looked for him. But this time Dorian was a step ahead. Hey, Sunny, it's me, Stefan. I wanted to spend a few nights at your place with Jackie. I was hoping that'd be okay? - Which one's her place? - Must live somewhere over there. - Stefan! Where are you? - Come find me! I had no idea Dorian was spying on me the whole time. If I had, I never would have let them stay with me. Boo! Hey, roomie, where are you? We can't wait to see you! Hello! I'm here. Stefan? Dorian had left a message. He wanted me to come to him. I knew it was a trap. Hey! Jackie! Jackie! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Stefan? I'm here. Sunny. Your pearl has reignited my inspiration. The scent of a baby. Ever since we were in that bunker together, I've known. A baby. That must be the heartbeat of my new formula. A baby, the most beautiful scent in the world. You are right. I know nothing about love. But I still can't give up. You will teach it to me. True love. I had to do that or you wouldn't have come. Look how beautiful it is here. Everything shines. We belong together. Your baby, me and you. We're a family. That is our destiny. It has been from the beginning. Ever since we met. You'll never smell anything again. I had carried the toxic, odorless substance with me the entire time. I took away everything he'd ever lived for. His dream of a perfume of love. His unique ability to recognize smells, remember them, and preserve them. I was free. No one found out what had happened. Not even Juro, your father. The perpetrator was found covered in black ink. He obviously had been drugged. My dreams... You can never imprison them. For one day we will build a hot air balloon together, and then we'll scatter my perfume over countries, cities, and mountains, until all hate turns into love. Here. Now you know our story. You needn't be afraid. Ooh. Ooh. Wow. Look, is it a butterfly? Oh...
