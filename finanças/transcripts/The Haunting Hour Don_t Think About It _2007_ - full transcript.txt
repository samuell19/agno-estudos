This is the fifth time your mother's had to come in here tonight. It's the fourth time. Third! What's the problem? He's staring at me! There you go. Now I can't tell what he's thinking. How's that? Better. Good night, sweetie. Wait! The curtains! I fixed the curtains the last time I came in here. You didn't like the shadows, remember? The shadow's worse. Jack: IT'S JUST THE TREES. Max: I DON'T LIKE TREES. Look, is this better? Will you lie down with me? Honey, when I do that, you don't go to sleep. You just want to talk. I won't. I promise. Please! Here's the deal. Max, if you can get to sleep without calling us into the room again, I'll get you that video game you've been wanting, ultra gorgonzola or... Ultimate gonzago? Right! Jack! I'm out of ideas, eileen. Okay, mom. I love you. We love you too, sweetie. Good night, dad. Good night, buddy boy. ( chuckles ) ( creaking ) ( breathing heavily ) ( creaking ) ( growls ) ( screams ) ( laughs ) That's what you get for wrecking my dvd player, you little brat. It was an accident! And I was accidentally hiding in your closet. I'm not scared of that thing. It's just rubber. True, but the real one is out there. ( screams ) MOM! Good-bye, video game. He's fine. I reassured him. Liar! Did you scare him again? Cassie: NO! Yes! You're gonna go too far one of these days. Tell him to stay out of my room. He's just trying to be closer to you, cassie. Look, this is a new adjustment for him. It's a new neighborhood. It's a new home. Why is everything always about him? Wh... cass... ( voice whispering ) ( whispering ) Cassie? You're gonna be late for school. Do you have to dress like that every day? Get out of my room. Fangs? àWhat's it about? If I told you, you'd have nightmares. All right, now, how about that outfit that I bought for you? Now, this would look darling on you. Yuck! You know, you might make new friends if you didn't try so hard to be different. I liked my old friends. Honey, I know it's awkward to be dropped into a new school, especially after the semester has started, but look, listen, just give it some time. It'll get better. Right.

Remember, your vote counts. I know we're gonna win. Don't worry. You can't lose. Good luck! I don't need luck. Okay, about the party... good idea with our costumes, and I think we should match. I'll e-mail you a list of what you guys can wear because fashion is important, so I'll pick your outfits. I think my daddy's gonna get me a limo. He is? A pink one. Are you serious? That's so cool! I know! Hi, sean. What's up, priscilla? Ralph: HEY, PRISCILLA. He's so hot. I wonder who he's taking to the dance. Who do you think? He asked you? He will. Ralph: OOH, I'M HUNGRY! Aren't you gonna eat that? What's wrong, bro? I'm toast. My english paper is due next friday, and I'm only this far in this stupid book. Why'd you pick such a thick book? The cover looked cool? I don't know. See, I never pick a book thicker than this. So you're not gonna eat that? If I get another d, my dad's not gonna let me play ball. Ralph: THAT'S HARSH. He's on my case 24/7. He called me an idiot. Ralph: DANG! Look at this thing. That would be like 10 books for me. I've read that book. What? I said I've read that book. I've read all of poe's work. Really? Cool. Here. Take it. Poe, of course, is a seminal figure in horror literature. He was a master at creating the intense atmosphere of poetic dread. And, of course, poe's self-tortured protagonists have become a horror convention. Oh, I've never been to a horror convention. Hey, pris, you got competition. That new girl? The living-dead reject? I don't think so. Hey, aren't you in one of my classes? I'm in your english class. I sit right in front of you. My name's cassie. Sean. Yeah, I've seen you. Maybe if you're having trouble, you know, getting through the book, I could... Hi. What's up? Yeah, what's up? What are you guys talking about? Sean's flipping over some term paper. Oh, poor baby. I'll help you. Really? I'll be your tutor after school all next week... At, um, my house. ( Sean sighs ) Cool. And we'll talk about it more at the dance if you'll take me. Sure, okay. Great, okay! Pick me up at 7:00. Don't be late. Oh! And by the way, didn't anyone tell you? The halloween dance isn't until next friday. ( all laughing ) Oh, my god! Wait! Leave it. It's an improvement. Oops.

Isn't there a halloween dance on friday? I guess. Oh, right, sweetie. Don't worry because a boy didn't ask you to go. Who cares? Boys your age are shy. I remember not wanting to go to a dance because no one asked me. I was the same age you are now. But my mother insisted that I go, and I ended up having so much fun. I can unpack my own stuff. Well, just give what I said some thought, okay? ( exclaims ) Jack: MAX, YOU'RE SUPPOSED To be helping me. So that's how it's gonna be, huh? I'm going down to the library. Anyone need anything?

When you're at the dance, remember to practice safe dancing and not dance too close. I wouldn't want to have to separate any of you. And now for the election results. The enthusiasm of the entire student body was wonderful. Who says you don't care? The winner and new pumpkin queen is... Priscilla wright! ( cheering ) Guess that makes you Mr. Pumpkin queen.

You are so dead. ( exclaims sarcastically ) ( bell rings ) Tonight is halloween. Who knows when halloween started? I thought I might see your hand, cassie. ( students sniggering ) Halloween started with the celts in what is now ireland around, like, 2,000 years ago. Teacher: GO ON, CASSIE. The celts celebrated the end of the harvest and the beginning of the days getting shorter and the nights getting longer. These long, dark nights made people think about death, as they do today. Teacher: YES. YES, I suppose that's true. But does anyone know where the custom for dressing up for halloween... Yes, cassie? The celts believed that on the night OF OCTOBER 31st, the boundary between the living and the dead became blurred. They thought that on this night, the ghosts of the dead came back to earth. ( wind blowing ) They would build big bonfires and dress up in animal masks and skins to frighten away the spirits, but then, over time, it changed into all hallows because the church taught that you were supposed to hallow the dead. Teacher: THAT'S VERY Impressive, cassie. Okay, get out your notebooks. Let's talk about... Term papers.

Then we're going home. I want wax lips. Then go! I can't! Look, a ladybug is going up there. Are you a bigger chicken than a ladybug? Maybe. Think how good it'll feel when you're brave.

Get in bed, and I'll read you the berenstain bears. I hate those stupid bears. I want this book. Forget it. Hey. ( computer powers down ) What? What did you do? Nothing. What did you do? It was an accident! You turned this off? You did it on purpose. It was an accident! Do you know what you did? You made me lose everything I wrote tonight! Hours of work!

Next time, loser, remember who you're messing with. I would have been scared, too. Cassie's a chicken! Cassie's a... ( shouts ) GET IN THE HOUSE!

Well, it can't be, because this is my brother right here. I killed him, and we'll be eating him for dinner later. I'm not kidding, okay? It's got priscilla, too! Well, I guess it's not totally evil. Gosh! I'm telling the truth. It's out in the woods! Why don't you believe me? Okay, where do you think your brother is? Sleeping. Well, then, go take a look! I'm being punked, right? Where's his room? Up here? Hey, you can't... Where do you think you're going? What are you doing? What... See? Max! Is he in on this? It must have dragged him out through here. ( exclaims in disgust ) You are telling the truth, aren't you? Your brother is gonna be toast! I ignored the warning. I read the book out loud. I just wanted to scare him. Well, good job. We've got to call the cops. On halloween? They'll never believe us, and by the time we can convince them, it'll be too late. We have to do something now. We have to kill that thing. What? ( spooky whispering ) ( dripping ) ( muffled voices ) ( pizza deliverer groaning ) ( growling ) Priscilla: WHAT IS THAT? Let me out! ( crying ) Max: CASSIE! CASSIE! Pizza deliverer: HELLO? Is anybody else in here? ( roaring ) Max: HELP! SOMEBODY Help me! Help! Priscilla's shoe. It was right here. It had your brother in its, uh... I don't know what you call it. The... Slimy and... Are you sure it was max? Pretty sure. He was whimpering. A whiny, irritating whimper? Yeah. That's max. Look. Ugh. Come on, I think it went this way. A walking stick? Are you sure your dad doesn't have a shotgun or something? Sean: MAX? Where are you? Sean: WHAT DO YOU THINK? Cassie: I THINK IT Could use a tissue. Sean: YOU'RE A WEIRD GIRL. Cassie: I KNOW. I'm sure the priscillas of the world are more your type. Sean: I DON'T KNOW. She's priscilla, but, dang, I don't think she deserves to die. That cockroach deal, I mean, that was kind of over the top. She deserved that. I don't know. I mean, so she dissed you. Be cool. Whatever. What are you so ticked-off about, anyway? And your brother, I mean, what did he do to you? He annoys me. Ouch. ( sighs ) So you think I'm weird, huh? Nah... i mean, in a good way. Different. Yeah, but not pretty like priscilla. I don't know. Well, you know, 'cause she's all... ( imitates scoff ) And all... ( imitates giggle ) Yeah, but you're... Nasty! ( exclaims ) Ugh. For a minute, I forgot we were in the middle of a nightmare. Sean, listen, you don't have to do this. I mean it. None of this was your fault. No biggie. John carlucci's parties suck anyway. Cassie: ( whispering ) Come on. This way. Uh, are you sure? Ow, sean! Sorry. Big shoes. Cassie: GOSH! Sean: I HATE THESE WEBS. ( Sean exclaims ) What? What? Something just ran over my foot. Just keep moving. There's no more slime. Which way? This way. Where are we? ( rodents squeaking ) ( Sean exclaiming in disgust ) Oh, my. Sean: OH, MY GOSH! Maybe it's out. Foraging? Well, I doubt it went to the market. Come on, let's make this fast. Max? Max? Max? Max: CASSIE! HELP! Somebody help me! Help! Please! Help! Max? Max: HELP! HELP! Max, are you okay? Help! Sean: MAX? Oh, my gosh! Max, just calm down. We'll get you out. Come on. Oh, my gosh! Here. Here. Pull this. Sean, what did you have for dinner? I was just about to ask you the same thing. ( quaking ) ( growls ) ( monster makes surprised noise ) Sean: I THINK WE'RE Gonna need bigger sticks. Run! This way! This way! ( screams ) Come on! Go! Go! Go! Faster! Faster! Sean, watch behind... He's got my leg! Sean! Come on! Shocker pen! ( creature screaming ) That was a fiasco. Yeah, and it didn't work, either. Why did you have to read that book out loud? I've got issues, okay? I mean, what is that book? Where did it come from? The halloween store. The halloween store! Of course! Wait. Wait. What halloween store? He knew all along it would happen! Well, who knew what would happen? The weirdo who sold me the book! What weirdo? He knows the magic. He has to! Come on. ( both knocking ) Hello? Hello? Open! Open up, please! He's not here. Wait... Oh, come on! Come on! Come on! Hey, wait! Sorry, no refunds. You knew the book was magic. As I recall, there's a warning plainly printed on the first page. But the evil thing is alive, and it has my brother! Aren't you the girl who likes to scare people? It's a powerful feeling to watch others cringe in fear. I bet you can't wait to see the frightened expression on your brother's face when he sees those babies hatch. Yes! No, I can wait. I don't want to see that expression. Well, you should have thought of that before. Oh, well. Buyer's remorse. Happens all the time in the retail trade. ( chuckles ) But there has to be something you can do. No, there has to be something you can do. You brought the evil thing from the darkness. Now you must figure out how to return it there. But you sold me the book. But you brought me to this town. You did? I did not. But you did. It was your wish to scare people that summoned me. Every halloween, I choose the one who wants to scare people the most. This year, it was between you and a nine-year-old in detroit. You won. Congratulations. But there has to be something you can sell me, something from the store. Store? What store? It's gone. It was just right here. What... There has to be some way to kill it. Two heads are better than one. That's the way to get the bloody job done. Happy halloween. ( laughs ) Well, what does that mean? Huh? What he said. "Two heads are better than one. That's the way to get the bloody job done." I don't know. Well, it's a riddle. Maybe it means our heads, like the expression. "Two heads are better than one." Like two heads can think better. That's the obvious meaning, but in a riddle, you look for the meaning that's not obvious. Sorry, I wasn't in class that day. For example, the evil thing has two heads. Well, how can that be better for us? I know. That's the problem. Unless they fought each other. Say that again. Unless they fought each other? Yes! You're brilliant! I am? But how do we get them to do that? Do what? Fight each other! How? I don't know! Bloody job. Bloody job. What would you need for a bloody job? Blood? And I know where to get some. Come on! Max: CASSIE! Cassie! Cassie! Help! Help! ( growling ) Sean: OKAY, Here's the plan. We lure the evil thing toward us. When it gets close, we throw the blood on it. That will cause the sucking head to attack its own body. When it draws its own blood, the other head will go into a frenzy. And then it will devour itself. Two heads are better than one. That's really smart. I know! I don't know what's gotten into me. But how do we lure it into our trap? Uh, I don't know. I know. With its mate. It has a mate? Doesn't everything? Forget I said that. ( hissing ) Max: HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help, please! Help! Cassie: MAX, PLEASE Don't be baby food. ( groans ) Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Come on. ( shushing ) Sorry. Max: HELP! Somebody help me! Help! Oh, no! The babies have hatched. Help! Help! Hurry. I don't see the evil thing. As long as it doesn't see us. Just start the mating call. How do we know that this is the mating call? It showed up before. It better not try to mate with me. Shh, shh, shh. Careful, careful. ( recorded growling sounds ) Sounds like love to me. Wow. ( grunts ) Keep coming, big mama. Come on. Come on. There we go. Come on. Get ready. ( hip hop music playing ) What? Oh, no. Here, the blood! No, you do it! You do it! Yeah, but you're supposed...

I didn't want any of this to happen. Get away from me! My dad's a lawyer. Let's go, sean. Sean, are you coming? Sean! I think I'll walk cassie home. Priscilla: YOU WHAT? I am disgusted! I'm the pumpkin queen! Pizza deliverer: HELLO? Is anybody else in here? Hear me and hear me good. I've got a complimentary large pizza with two toppings, your choice, coming at you. I'm serious. Could you get me down from here? Sean: YEAH. Yeah, sure. Here. Come on. Oh, right here. Be careful. Grab my hand. Here. ( honks ) Hey, wait up. ( car backfires ) Hey, you need a ride? In your dreams!

My dad is gonna kill me. Hey, max, thanks for saving my life. You're a brave kid. Oh, but you got some pepperoni on your shirt. ( laughs ) I can't believe I still have to write that term paper and I haven't even started yet. I'll write it for you. Oh, thanks, but, you know, I should probably finally write my own term paper. I'll tutor you. At my house. All right, cool. Stay weird. Cassie, will you read me the berenstain bears go to camp? You got it. Come on. Jack: SO, DID YOU THINK I made a good impression? Yeah, I'm sure we can replace that helmet collection. Looks like the house is still standing. Yeah, it's a good sign. I wonder if the kids got along. This is itchy. Yeah, well, let's not hold our breath. After you, sir. ( laughing ) Toro. Yeah. Eileen, come on. Come on. Oh, my! Now, there's a sight, huh? Looks like the kids started a fire. Oh, good. Put another log on there. Honey, what happened to all the fireplace tools? I have no idea. Look at this. Look what I found in the fire. I could have sworn I left a roast out. Look at this. What? Look at what? What is that? I'm trying to tell you. A strange little book I found in the fireplace. What's it doing there? You got me. Wait a minute. You know what? I know I left a roast out. Listen to this. "Do not read aloud." ( both laughing ) Read it. "The evil thing is a gruesome beast. "On living flesh, it loves to feast. ( growls softly ) "It's a two-headed thing whom you don't wish to greet. One head sucks your blood. One head chews your meat." This is great. "It carries its babies in slimy eggs on its back. "The babies are hungry when they hatch for a snack, "so the evil thing traps some poor victim alive "for the babies to eat when their birthdays arrive. "But don't worry. Don't cry. Please don't have a fit. The evil thing is not real unless you think about it." How can you not think about it? ( creaking ) Shopkeeper: HAPPY HALLOWEEN. ( laughing ) Sounds good? Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. Emily Osment. "I don't think about it."
