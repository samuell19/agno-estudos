- What are you doing? - Can't you see I'm playing? - Do you like your doll? - Of course. Her name's Elizabeth. She's very pretty. Won't you let me hold her for a while? I'm very protective of my doll, you know that. Give her back. Eveline. You're wicked. You're wicked, Eveline. Let me have my doll. Don't hurt her. Please, Eveline. Give me back my doll. If you don't give me back my doll, I'll... Grandfather, look what Eveline's doing. I want my doll. If you don't give her back I'll pull your hair out. Come on, stop it. Give her back her doll. She always takes her, grandfather. She never leaves me alone. I'm the Red Queen and Kitty's the Black Queen. - I'm the Red Queen... - Eveline, give her back her doll. Eveline. grandfather will get your doll back for you. I'm the Red Queen and Kitty's the Black Queen. Eveline, don't be foolish Eveline... What are you doing? == I hate you, grandfather. - No. My doll. - I hate you. I hate you. Stop it. Get up. Kitty, let me go. Get up. - Stop it. - I'll kill you, Kitty. - That's enough. - I'll kill you. Get up. - She started it, grandfather. - That's not true. I'm sorry, grandfather, I didn't want to do it, but when I looked at that picture I felt something inside me. grandfather, you never really told us what that picture means, just that one was good and the other was bad. Mary, bring me my drops. - Please be quick. - Right away, sir. Will you tell us, grandfather? I'd have preferred never to talk about that picture with you, but perhaps the time has come. Many, many years ago the Red Queen and the Black Queen lived in this castle. They were sisters like you two. They'd hated each other since they were children. The Black Queen silently put up with the Red Queen's wicked schemes, waiting for the time when she could have vengeance. When the Red Queen fell in love with a man, the Black Queen finally got her revenge and murdered her sister one night while she was sleeping. She brutally stabbed her seven times. Legend has it that a year after her death the Red Queen came back to life, spreading terror. She murdered six innocent people. The seventh was the Black Queen. At peace once again, the Red Queen returned to her grave, but the same thing happened a hundred years earlier and a hundred years later, always in this castle and always between two sisters, and it will keep happening every hundred years. Do you believe in these things, grandfather? It's nonsense. They're just legends, there's no truth in them. According to the legend, when is it supposed to happen next? In 14 years' time. In 1972, to be precise. That's a long way off, grandfather. You're right. Mary? - Yes, sir? - Have that picture removed today. Throw it away. I never want to see it again. You two go and play. THE RED QUEEN KILLS SEVEN TIMES grandfather. Haven't you been outside long enough? No, Franziska. I like it. I love living in the countryside. Don't worry. Are you feeling unwell? - What's wrong? - We'd better go in. I'm rather cold. Kitty called. She asked about you and said she'll come and visit us very soon. Kitty's a liar. She never comes. I haven't heard from Eveline either. She's in America, grandfather. She could still write every so often. Is that you? Who is it? Did you hear... It's Franziska. - What is it? - grandfather... - What's happened? - grandfather... I ran into his room last night and found him with his eyes wide open. He'd fallen next to the bed. A heart attack. It was really awful. Poor grandfather. Hadn't we all been hoping for the old man to die? - Won't let you say things like that. - Isn't it true? There's a nice inheritance waiting for us. You, dear little Kitty, his favourite granddaughter, will get the biggest portion. As for Franziska and me, we'll have our share, which will be half of Kitty's. Isn't that right, darling, or are we going to spit on it? You're vile, Herbert. Well, Kitty? I've got nothing to say. We already agreed. Why the long face? Our lives are about to change. If you're referring to my job, you're wrong. I'm not giving it up. Last night I saw the Red Queen in the park. I told you, didn't I? Herbert had gone down to the library. He couldn't sleep. All of a sudden he heard a yell and a chilling laugh. He ran to the window and saw the Red Queen running away. That's ridiculous. It was just his imagination. I know, it was just his imagination. But, Kitty... I heard that laugh too. - And there's something else. - What? Didn't Herbert tell you that the Red Queen had Eveline's face? No, Franziska, it can't be true. Yes, I know. We know that Eveline's dead. Come here a minute. Good. Just like that. Ready, Lulu? Keep your back straight on the Vespa. Frederick, send them all to the lab. Help sort those models out and then come back here. All right, Kitty. Frederick, set the camera up for shooting in colour. Look at those two love-birds, Lenore. He's trying to forget his deranged wife and she's doing all she can... - Tired? - A little. - You need a rest, darling. - I know. Come to my office, I want to talk about next summer's models. I think Martin's pretty good-looking. Will your sister be there for the reading of the will? No, Eveline's still in America, I told you. We don't even know her address. I've tried to find her but... Why are you so interested in my sister? Why are you getting upset? I don't see what the problem is. Until a few months ago you couldn't stop talking about her. You're right. It was liberating, as if I was breaking free from her. Eveline tormented and humiliated me for years. But despite all that, Martin, I really miss her. "I, Tobias Wildenbruck, being in full possession of my mental faculties, "write and declare the following. "On this day, January 12th 1972, I decree "that when my death comes during this fateful year, "which is to be expected with my unstable state of health, "to prevent serious misfortune from striking our family, "my estate shall not be divided among my heirs "until the current year is over. "At the start of the new year "Mr Bauer, my chosen executor, "will open the envelope enclosed here, which he will keep until then, "containing the list of my assets "and my instructions for dividing them among my granddaughters, "Kitty Wildenbruck, Franziska Wildenbruck Zieler, "Eveline Wildenbruck." That's all. Who knows what Mr Wildenbruck was thinking? He'd been behaving pretty strangely recently. There's no logic to the will. What difference does it make if we have our inheritance now or in a year's time? grandfather didn't believe in the legend. I guess it's not a bad thing. Why? For Eveline. We've got more time. You go ahead, Franziska. I'll close the door. Scream and I'll slit your throat. Listen to me, Kitty. I've been looking for Eveline for months. I want her. - I want her. - I know. I know Eveline's not in America. I don't know where she is, but she's here. You can't do this to me, Kitty. I can't live without Eveline. It's up to you. Nobody can help you. I could kill you right now. - Go on, answer her. - I'm coming. I won't hurt you. You just need to tell me where Eveline is, or else I'll kill you. I'll slit your throat. Listen, I don't know anything. I don't know where Eveline is. Wait... You're lying. You know but you don't want to say it. I love Eveline. And I want the money. Actually, I don't care about Eveline. I want money. Lots of money. I'll get in touch when I need it, understand? Lots, lots of money... Of course. You called me, Hans? Let's hear what Martin has to say, our brilliant and indispensable deputy manager. Who's idea was this publicity campaign? Our publicity manager. He's in Paris, remember? He's incompetent. Conceited and incompetent. We want to dress everyone in Germany. This isn't how to manage a firm. I've always been very professional. Isn't this a high-quality campaign for high-quality clothes? The campaign mustn't be elitist. I want everyone in Germany to wear our clothes. We can achieve this goal by producing quality garments for the masses. I want Spring to be the Mercedes of clothing. Don't forget this slogan, Miss Roselli. And you too, Martin. It could come in useful. But not at Spring while I'm here. You don't have the right qualities. That's all for today, Lulu. I'm tired. We'll do the rest later. Take it to the lab and tell them to overexpose it. - Is Kitty in there? - Have you come to see me naked? Have a look. What do you think? - I'll think about it. - Don't. I wouldn't know what to do with you. Kitty is a poor conquest, isn't she? Come back when you're general manager. Physically, I like you much more than Hans. I'll be in charge soon and I'll fire you. We need good models, not whores. - Kitty's a nice whore. - Go to hell. What does your insane wife think about Kitty? We'd gone to the park as usual and... We found this a few metres from the body. Must've got broken in the struggle. It's covered in the victim's blood. Miss Palm, don't be afraid. Tell me what happened. Why were you there? Hans was a man... How can I put it? We had what you can call a "good relationship‚Äù. He wasn't like other men. Not that there aren't other men like Hans, but he... He was quite strange, always looking for some kind of new kicks, new feelings in sexual relationships. What did Martin tell you? The truth, Hans. That I'm a whore. And that you only give me work because I'm your lover. And, last but not least, that you're an impotent swine. He's an idiot. I'm going to throw him out on the street like a dog as soon as I get the chance. Do you like that one? Yes. I like her. Good, Lulu. Do you want to earn 1,000 marks? - Are you up for a threesome? - I want half upfront. I couldn't imagine that... Do you confirm what Miss Palm said? - You heard a laugh? - Yes, a horrible chilling laugh. Like a mad woman, Inspector. And you saw a woman running away? She was wearing a red cape and her eyes and hair were black. I took a real good look at her as she ran past us. Her face was long and oval with prominent features. One more question, Mr Hoffmann. When do you intend to re-open the factory? Tomorrow. We decided on a single day of mourning. Spring can't just stop. We employ 400 people and their families depend on us. I imagine you know you'll be taking over as general manager. I was wondering when you were going to ask me that. I'm the most likely candidate. I'm already deputy manager. This morning the board of directors asked me to take over the general manager's duties. Was there friction between you and Meyer? Only differences of opinion on a professional level. Any disagreements over women? - What do you mean? - I'm talking about Lulu Palm. She was with Hans Meyer yesterday when he was murdered. I have no interest in that woman. Yesterday you said you'd fire her as soon as you became general manager. - What are you talking about? - Shall we step in here, Mr Hoffmann? I was looking for you, Rosemary. I was in the hall earlier. Didn't you see me? What are you doing? I was looking at Hans Meyer's last drawings. He wanted to use them for our new publicity campaign. - It would have been a big mistake. - Is that what Martin thinks too? He was a great general manager. Once he told me something that I'll never forget. "I am our company, Spring. "Without me, my staff would be lost. They'd dry up like leaves. "They're just aesthetes. "They were right to guillotine aesthetes during the French Revolution." - Why did you want me? - We're needed in his office. This is a profile of Hans Meyer's murderer. Our experts constructed it from the witnesses' descriptions. One of them got a close look at the woman in the red cape. Good, have a seat. We're all here now. A woman with black eyes and hair. But it could have been a man wearing a wig and contact lenses. You worked closely with Hans Meyer and knew him well. This will hopefully help us solve the case quickly. Do you recognise that face, Miss? No, Inspector, definitely not. It could be anybody. I was just thinking about poor Hans. What about you, Miss Rosemary? You were Meyer's lover for a year so you must have known about his strange habits. Were you ever involved with a woman like the one in the profile? As for you, Miss Palm, Hans Meyer's last partner before he was Killed, I believe you've left out several very important details. I suppose you've never met the woman in the profile. Of course not. That's all for today. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Well, we're done for now. Should we have a board meeting? Yes, tomorrow or the day after. The main thing is to get back to work with Hans' enthusiasm and focus. That drawing reminds me of someone. Your sister Eveline in the sketch I did a few months ago. You're wrong, Lenore. It's nothing like her. It's strange that she never wrote to me. We were very close. Don't you have her address? I haven't heard from her for a while. I just know that she lives in America. But how could Eveline be connected to Hans Meyer? I'm Kitty Wildenbruck and this is a recording. If you want to leave a message, you have 45 seconds after the beep. This is Eveline... Are you surprised to hear my voice? I've come back from my long journey. I'm back, Kitty, and I'm going to Kill you too. You know, I'm finally starting to understand some things. What do you mean? Hans Meyer. He really knew what he was doing. His ideas weren't as foolish as they seemed. Are you going to inform on him? But I realised I was wrong about a lot of things. I see what you mean. When you're in charge of a big organisation like Spring you can't have weaknesses. It's a war. It's kill or be killed. But who would have gained from killing Hans? Me, for example. But it could have been the Red Queen. I advised Kitty to buy a block of shares in Spring. It's an excellent investment. I also thought... Herbert, please... But not straight away. We'll need to wait until next year. There's a financial... You two are so boring. All you talk about is business. Kitty, calm down. It's me, Franziska. What's wrong, Kitty? When I saw you leave the room I knew you'd come here, but why? Eveline's got nothing to do with what's happening. Do you understand? I want to see... I want to see that cell with my own eyes. Don't be silly. I didn't want to believe you and Herbert when grandfather died, but... You did right. It's not possible. Yes, but you too said that... Herbert saw her, I didn't. Maybe he really did see her. What do you mean, Kitty? Eveline's dead. But they saw the Red Queen when Meyer was Killed. Martin says it's possible, and the police... - What happened with the police? - It's horrible. The police reconstructed the murderer's face. It's Eveline's. Lenore recognised her too. That night she was wearing a red cloak like the lady in the painting. This is stupid, Kitty. The dead don't come back. Eveline's buried in the cell. Don't worry, we'll go and have a look. Come. So Martin killed Hans Meyer. It's a war. It's kill or be Killed. It's the cloak, Kitty. The Red Queen. I can't believe you think I'm guilty. It's as if we never knew each other, Kitty. You're destroying these two years. I Know our situation's not easy because of my wife. But you're hiding something from me and I don't understand why. Why won't you tell me the truth? I've told Inspector Toller the truth. He was here. As soon as Eveline's found, everything will be clear. I really hope so, Kitty. For you. For both of us. Everything's changing. There's a dark space in our lives and we'll end up not understanding each other. Come on, that's enough. It's just a difficult time. It'll pass. That's easy to say, Martin, but what about us? What's the point in carrying on? How can we be so suspicious of each other? Please, Kitty. Everything will get better, you'll see. It'll all get better. No, I'm sorry, but I... - Kitty, why are you being like this? - I don't know. I'm afraid. There's something above us. A mysterious force that's destroying us, and there's nothing we can do to fight it. Walk over to the Mini. No, Rosemary, I think you've made a mistake. I'd have stayed on as Martin's secretary. I wouldn't have given him that pleasure. And watch him following Kitty around all the time? Impossible. Not for much longer. I've already set up my plan of attack. I'll keep my position as. The general manager's lover. We need to talk, Kitty. It's very important. All right, everybody ready. What's the matter? No, not here. I think I've found out who the Red Queen is. Open the door. It's me, Lenore. She works for Spring. Get out of here. There's nothing to see. 25 years old, single. - No distinguishing features. - What are you waiting for? Multiple stab wounds to the stomach, chest and legs. Just one question. Where were you at 2:40 this afternoon? At a board meeting. There were at least 18 people. That's enough witnesses. Am I right in thinking Miss Lenore Reudberg was your wife's friend? They were at secondary school together and remained friends until... How's your wife? Is she still in that psychiatric hospital? Yes, unfortunately. I hope she gets better soon. And don't disappear just yet. We may need to have another chat. Martin, it's awful. Lenore said she wanted to talk to me. I don't know what about, but... - And right after that she was... I think I know what she wanted to tell you. She told me about the police Profile. Lenore believed that the woman could be your sister Eveline. We need to tell the police. And get even more involved in this nasty business? Lenore was wrong. I'm certain of that. I saw the Profile too. It didn't look anything like my sister. Hold me tight. I'm so... So upset... - You're Martin, aren't you? - Yes, that's right. I recognised you straight away. - Elizabeth... - Don't touch me. You're filthy. What do you mean, Elizabeth? I'm Martin, your husband. All men are filthy beasts. Don't touch me. Don't come near me. I don't want you to. I'd like to ask you something, Elizabeth. When I came to see you last week you told me about a woman. A woman who comes to visit you. You said her name was...Eveline. She's my friend. She comes to see me every night. We climb over the garden gate, we run far away in a green sea of light and we're free... Free What are you talking about, Elizabeth? I'm not afraid of running in the sea. I'll do it again. She promised to take me away from here. Eveline tells the truth. Eveline is good. You know, Martin, she said that you love another woman now. I'll never let you marry her. - You can't do it. - Please... You mustn't, Martin. Please, Elizabeth, calm yourself. I've got something important to tell you. Eveline will bring me a knife so I can kill you. I hate you and I'm going to kill you Martin. She talked about someone who comes to visit her. A woman. A woman who told her that she'll help her run away. Your wife is in a permanent hallucinatory state. At this stage in the treatment the drugs can increase the intensity of the hallucinations. Professor, could you please keep my wife under close observation? Who is it? The gate was open. I've had a visit from the police. That's right. He was over at my house until an hour ago. Well? You know what they suspect? That we killed Hans Meyer together. You and I. You'd become general manager and I'd be your lover. That wasn't exactly what he said, but he tactfully implied that things may well have taken that course. And I suppose he must have some idea of how we did it too. Of course. Something like this: I take Hans to that park, I set up an alibi with that prostitute and you Kill him. Sure. Dressed as a woman in a red cape. I think this is the only thing that's puzzling them. Toller isn't too worried about details, though. Lenore must have known something. She knew you. She was your wife's friend, and your friend too. This time you set up your alibi by calling a board meeting. I take advantage of the fact that I'm with Lenore all day at work, and when we're on our break... I kill her. But you're not my lover, so there's no motive. That's a detail that I didn't want to question. Why? You ask me why? I really do want to be your lover. Don't you believe me? I've already got enough women. Sure, a wife in a psychiatric hospital and a lover. Kitty. I bet when you go to bed you don't make love, you just talk about it. What if I like talking about love? Whatever, but I don't understand why you're angry. Do you really want to turn down a woman like me? Since you can have us both, you could talk about love with her and have a good time with me. I know some special tricks. You've heard me talking about them. Even the police know I'm an incredible nymphomaniac. As you can see, my charms are having some effect. I never said I wasn't attracted... ...to a woman like you. I've always loved you, Martin. You've always loved the general manager. That's really pretty. I've never seen it on you before. I only wear it on special occasions. It's very old, Martin. A friend gave it to me. I'll finish undressing you. I like it. Elizabeth, come here. I'm waiting for you. Take me away, Eveline. Now. I want to come away with you. Set me free. Give me the knife first. If you want, Elizabeth. - Mrs Hoffmann. - Over there, at the gate. She's here, Doctor. Yesterday you spoke to the consultant at the hospital, Professor Wendel. You said a woman had promised to help your wife escape and you asked him to put her under close observation. - Is that correct? - Exactly. I just repeated the words my wife had said to me. Words that only you heard. An excellent way to construct an alibi, Mr Hoffmann. Of course. Another alibi. It's easy to turn everything against me. If I was in your shoes, I'd be rather worried. Yes, I forgot. About a month ago, your wife wrote a will. What? She left everything she owned to the Mental Health Research Institute. Here goes part of your motive for murdering Mrs Hoffmann. But you knew very well that your wife Elizabeth was getting better. Professor Wendel told you. But at the time of her murder, your wife didn't have all her mental capacity. Therefore... you are the only heir to her estate. But...where was this will? It was found among the personal effects of your wife's friend, Lenore Reudberg. The Spring designer, who was also murdered. What are you doing here? I don't know. They called me at work and asked me to come in. I don't even know what they want or what's happened. My wife was murdered last night. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Elizabeth Hoffmann's murder last night. I only heard about the tragic event just now, from Mr Hoffmann. I don't understand why I've been... Would you mind listening to a phone call I received a few hours ago? Hello? Police? I'd like to speak to Inspector Toller. - Hold the line. - Inspector Toller speaking. Inspector, if you want to know more about Elizabeth Hoffmann, who was Killed last night, you need to speak to Rosemary Miiller from Spring. I don't understand. Rosemary Miller. So, did you recognise the voice? Do you suspect anybody? It doesn't matter. One more thing, Miss Muller. - Where were you last night at 1.307 - At home, in bed. Do you live alone? Did you make or receive a phone call around that time? Actually, yes, Inspector, I did make a call but nobody answered. I left a message on the answering machine. It was about postponing a work meeting. Answering machines don't record the times of calls. No, of course not. Who was the message for? Martin Hoffmann's lover? You resigned as his secretary, didn't you? Why? We had different ideas about managing Spring. Spring... All the murders are to do with Spring. The last victim was Martin Hoffmann's wife, another Spring connection. You could be the next victim of the woman in the red cape. The fifth...or the sixth. The seventh should be Kitty Wildenbruck. If you know anything or suspect anyone, you need to talk. Inspector, I don't know anything. I've got nothing to be afraid of, I can assure you. One last question, Miss Muller. Is the name Eveline familiar? Kitty has a sister called Eveline but I think she's been in America for a while. I already know that. I've questioned her relatives. Did you know her personally? - Why are you asking me this? - I asked whether or not you knew her. Was this all of Lenore's material at Villa Liberty? I don't know. I think so. But now that you mention it, we may be missing a few rolls. Kitty, I'm sorry I'm late. I've just got back from the police station. Because of Elizabeth's death? Perhaps this isn't important, but before she died she mentioned a name. How did you know? Kitty, we've got to go to the police. You need to help me. What do you mean? Inspector Toller needs to know that the Profile looks like your sister. I won't let you keep on denying it. Don't make me do this alone, Kitty. - No, Martin, I... - I've got to do this. There's no other alternative. I'm suspected of all these murders. Even my wife's death is a trap. If anything else happens, I'm done for. Martin, are you absolutely sure it was Eveline? I don't know. But why did Elizabeth say her name just before she died? You can't be an accomplice to these terrible crimes. You need to talk. Look, Eveline's got nothing to do with this. It's ridiculous, Martin. It's not possible. Why are you so afraid of the police? Why do you say it can't have been Eveline? Well? Eveline's dead. I killed her. What? What's happened? I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. There were times when it seemed like Eveline was possessed by a demon. I shouldn't have reacted like that but I couldn't control myself. Herbert and Franziska helped me so that the police wouldn't find out. Everybody knew we'd always hated each other. They would never have believed me. We hid Eveline's body in the secret cell in the castle. But now Eveline... Eveline's come back and she kills like the Red Queen. Back then the last victim was also her sister, the Black Queen. The Black Queen. What are you talking about, Kitty? The legend. The legend our grandfather used to tell us when we were children. - The legend... - Come on, darling. Don't be like this. Be calm. You mustn't worry. We'll figure out what to do, later on. For now, we're trapped, both of us. But we'll get out of this. You'll see. - No, Peter... - Get out my way. You've gone too far, Peter. If you don't go I'll call the police. That's not a good idea. You'd be more at risk than I would. What is it? Are you afraid? I've found out how Eveline was killed and who did it. What do you want from me? More money. A lot more money. Or I'll go to the police myself. I won't say where Eveline is as long as you keep paying. It's her share of the inheritance, after all. Come on, pay up. I want more money. Tonight. Give it to me. Let go of me. I can assure you there wasn't any negligence on our side. I'm not looking for a culprit, Professor. There's a history of insanity in my wife's family so I can't blame anybody. Incidentally, can the use of drugs cause madness? Yes, and curiously enough, it's frequent in wealthy families. We've had patients from aristocratic families. We've tried to preserve their anonymity, like with the Gotterschaums and the Wildenbrucks. Who? Kitty Wildenbruck? Or Franziska Zieler Wildenbruck? I'm sorry, Mr Hoffmann, but you're asking for too much information. Hello, Rosemary. She says you're going too far. Kitty doesn't have any more money and I'm tired of this business. It's dangerous. I've had enough. You can't back out, Peter. You're in too deep now. This is the last time, Rosemary. When I was tripping the other day, I found out who the Killer was. Yeah, and I can prove it. What are you talking about, Peter? You're a drug addict, a good-for-nothing. You're worthless. Are you sure Kitty won't pay any more? Not until she gets her inheritance. Wait, Kitty. - Leave me alone. - Don't be afraid. I need to talk to you. - It's very important. Please listen to me. - Let me go. - So you're... - Get in, Peter. I wasn't expecting you. Why have you come here? The police questioned me again. They wanted to know about Peter and Eveline. What are you talking about? Who's Peter? - Nobody, don't worry. - What are you hiding from me? It's not important, I can assure you. You're all worked up, darling. Calm down. If you don't calm down you'll give yourself away and we'll be in trouble. I'm sorry but I can't find the fault. I'll call the electrician tomorrow. Come and sit down. Relax. You mustn't worry. Everything will sort itself out, you'll see. What's the matter? Kitty, what a surprise. We haven't seen each other for a while. How are you? I was wondering where our Kitty had gone to. Why don't you stay at the castle? Stay with us for a few days. Would you like that? You tell her, darling. There's no need, Herbert. Kitty's at home here. She knows it's always a pleasure for us. The two of us are so lonely here. - Haven't you seen her? - She can't have disappeared. - Where could she be? - In the cells. You killed me. I've come back to get my revenge. -The Red Queen... Up there. She's in the grave. Stop this, Kitty. - Hello, Martin. - Do you know Piaget? I went into the shop. Look. Do you like it? It's beautiful, isn't it? It's for you, darling. I can't stand it any longer. I'm frightened. I've been shut up in your house for days now, but I'm afraid. Eveline's in her cell. I saw her. I know she's dead but I also know that she'll kill again and I don't know what to do. I could hide or run away, but where? There's no point. Come on, Kitty. Think about It. It can't happen. Dead people don't come back. Yes, you're right, but there have already been five murders. And according to the curse, I must be the seventh victim. You've forgotten the sixth one. It could be me. Why not? You're right. You and Eveline? We'd just turned nine. It's very old, Martin. A friend gave it to me. Was Eveline friends with Lulu? No, she never met her. - Are you sure? - Definitely. Strange... Mr Bauer will open the envelope enclosed here, which he will keep until then... - I have to leave you, Kitty. Sorry. - Martin... Don't open the door to anyone and don't go out. Don't be afraid, I'll be back soon. I found out who you were after Elizabeth's death. We can come to an agreement. It's up to you. If not, I'm warning you, I'll go to the police. It's Eveline. You mustn't be afraid. I can explain everything. It's not possible. You're not Eveline. - Because Eveline's dead. - No. I'm alive. I'm waiting for you at Marktplatz 43. Come alone or else you won't find me. Marktplatz? Nobody lives in that house. You have four keys. One is for my house. Look in your handbag. What? Look in your handbag. You have four keys. - Three. - No. Four. The fourth key. Stop him. You, look upstairs. My dear Herbert, I have some questions for you if you don't mind. A few minutes ago, Kitty Wildenbruck was here... You're lying. We received a phone call from that poor girl. Before she died she told us that Kitty Wildenbruck shot her. It's not true. It was a trap. When Kitty arrived Lulu was already dead. So Kitty Wildenbruck was here. And I was here before her. I received an anonymous phone call. The killer is the Red Queen. She wanted you to think it was me or Kitty. The Red Queen again. Eveline Wildenbruck is dead. It was her sister Kitty who killed her. That's not true. Kitty's not a murderer. So where's Eveline, then? We checked. She never left for America. Not by plane or any other way, and not under a false name. Where is she, then? Why did she disappear? What happened to her? Why did she leave all her friends and relatives without a single word? I know why. She was going to inherit a fortune. Who would benefit more from getting rid of her than Kitty? And if it wasn't Kitty Wildenbruck... who killed Eveline Wildenbruck? Eveline's dead, Inspector. But Kitty's innocent. Kitty didn't want to Kill her. As I had arranged, now that the year of the curse has passed, I decree, in full possession of my mental faculties, that my estate, including the castle in Neustein, shall be divided into four equal shares among my heirs. Kitty Wildenbruck, to whom I also leave the castle, Franziska Wildenbruck Zieler, And, finally, to the one who took the name of Eveline, dear Eveline, orphan from a family of peasants, who made it possible for the curse to remain unfulfilled, I also leave my hunting lands... Kitty, I... It was her. It's her. Now she'll kill you too. It was Franziska. Open up. Open up, Franziska What... - Tell me where Kitty is, Franziska. -|...don't know. Don't be ridiculous. I know everything, and this is her car. I haven't seen her. There's no point in pretending any more. Tell me the truth, Franziska. Look, I've got the will here. Rosemary is Kitty's real sister. She's Eveline, isn't she, Franziska? Tobias switched them when they were little, to try to break the curse. The girl who thought she was Eveline was the daughter of poor peasants who'd sold her. It's written here, Franziska, in the letter that was supposed to be opened next year. Now tell me where Kitty is. Nobody can do anything now. You can't do anything for Kitty. Kitty's lost. She got what she deserved. I wanted the whole Wildenbruck estate... the properties, the castle. Why should I share it with Kitty and Eveline? She wasn't even a Wildenbruck. I was the only one who was close to old Tobias at the end. I nursed him, I sacrificed myself for him. It was at that moment, when I saw Eveline in the lake, that something snapped inside me. I would kill them all and be the only Wildenbruck left. I knew the secret of the will. I traced Rosemary Miller myself. I found her a job at Spring. I told her she was a Wildenbruck. I started to influence her. The Red Queen, the legend... I got her into drugs. Peter helped me a lot. We blackmailed Kitty to keep Eveline's death secret. Under the effect of drugs, Rosemary started killing. People from her world, Hans Meyer, Lulu, Lenore and your wife. And Kitty. She would have killed her. She would have done it. Rosemary was the instrument of my revenge. But then she became afraid. Afraid of her own murderous madness, so I killed her. - Yes, I killed her. I did. - Tell me where Kitty is or I'll kill you. - Martin, let's come to an agreement... - You're mad, Franziska. Come on, talk. Tell me where Kitty is or I'll kill you. Martin, you don't... There's no escape for Kitty now. Listen to me. You and I, we can have everything. You won't kill me. You can't kill me. You and me, Martin. It's all over for Herbert too. I sent him to Marktplatz. They've charged him with Lulu's murder. I couldn't stand living with that cripple any longer. The lame wretch. No, Herbert. Don't. I'm dying, but you won't be happy. Nobody will be happy. Nobody. Kitty... Save her. There's a secret cell in the cellar. It's behind a slab of marble. We need to hurry, Martin. Save Kitty. Wildenbruck Castle. Be careful with that wheel. Be ready with the stretcher. Get a move on. Look out, Herbert. Hang on. Quick. Help her. Herbert Zieler, aged 38. Franziska Zieler Wildenbruck, aged 34. The man was drowned in the basement of the castle. The woman has gunshot wounds. Martin Hoffmann, aged 35 was stabbed in the chest with a sharp knife.
