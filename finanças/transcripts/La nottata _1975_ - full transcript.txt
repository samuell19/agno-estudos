Piero! And let them sing a song for you... He must come back immediately, got it? Or I'll report him! I won't even give you 1000 lira. It's no use making that face. And don't even think about asking your mother. If you need money, get a job! I know, I know... You're capable of finding it. God knows how! Best not to think about it. You're not ashamed of anything nowadays. I'd like to know where you go. You can stay at home. What's wrong with that? You'll never get married living like that. THE LONG NIGHT Sometimes, I think I'm very likeable. At times, nasty. I think you're very likeable. Listen... Come here a moment. I've something to tell you. No, I already know that stuff. Well? How do I look? Come here! I've something important to tell you. That's all you think about. It's an obsession. We've been here for ages. I really need a breath of fresh air. Hold on. Where are you going? Well... See you. And thanks! Wait! At least give me your phone number. Shall we take her to the cinema? - Thanks but I'm blind. What a pity. She can't see her ass! What did you say? - I didn't say anything, I did this. It means that, if you want, you can put it... You know where. If that isn't enough... we'll add the forefinger. Look at that! - Well done, guys! Very well. They're not women anymore, they've become men! They're only missing... She's got them! Come on, give me your phone number. I swear I won't hassle you. Go on. Don't you like me? - No, it's not that. Well? Then what is it? - You see... My name's Renzo. - You see, Renzo... It was nice. Very nice. You make love so well. All the more reason, right? - Or maybe all the less. Where are you off to? - To a party. I can't take you with those shoes! I'll buy new ones. - Come on, don't be childish. What do you mean 'childish'? - Bye. Sorry. - Not at all. How are you gonna get in? - Don't worry. I get in whenever I want. All this fuss just to see him. I'll see you in a minute. I'll be right back. Good morning. I heard the toilets here were good. I could live in a toilet. Well, not mine, because that really is a dive. I don't know if you agree with me... but toilets are the only place where you can relax nowadays. I'm not kidding, you know. I'd even screw in a toilet. In the tub, of course. Do you like my garter belt? They're back in fashion. They give men a hard-on! Listen, lady, I've got a hang-up. I always think one's bigger than the other. What do you think? She must be crazy. She got scared. She must be middle-class. A bare tit is enough to make her run away. I still think one's bigger than the other. Did you find it there? Is it yours? Maybe. Maybe? - Maybe. Maybe I took it from a lady... who was in a toilet. Maybe she forgot it. Maybe. I'm sure I left it over there by the mirror. It's gone. It was here, I remember. Excuse me, have you seen my ring? Your ring? - Yes. Would you mind helping me with the clasp, because... You look for it. I'll help her. Come in the light because I can't see anything. Thank you. That's enough! I might even get offended. I'm sure I left it here. I was making myself up. Putting on the Rimmel... She took off her pants! What can I possibly do with your ring? It was probably her. How dare you? - Me? Yes, her! She looks like a thief! She's completely nuts. - It's impossible! Suzy. - Angela. It has no effect on me. See? It doesn't make my cock stiff. Alfina The Witch will cure you, stranger. Where have you taken me? Who cares? It's an hour out of circulation. Let's sit down. Is it today's paper? - What are you doing? Ah, knight, knight. Come on. It's so big! You're still hungry for love, knight? Is there anything I can do to please you? - Of course, Queen. I feel like I'm floating. Let me try the Bolognese delights. Yes! You know something, Lucrezia? You're the prettiest woman in Pomezia. The sun shines on your body. There's no one who can sleep next to you! Oh, Monsignor! Luckily, it's Heaven that's sent you. Monk Lorenzo makes the hubbub and I... But, Monsignor, what are you doing? You're worse than the monk! Monsignor! Now? - Now! Yes! You've ruined me completely! - Completely? You're joking, my lady. The third monk is still missing. - Oh, no! Well? - Is that all? Yes, why? - Let's hope it grows, punk. Did you see that stuff? No one was missing. - Everyone was there. - Indeed. Hey, cashier. It's sheer madness! All sexual maniacs upstairs? We ran off. I might go to the police and make a nice complaint! To the police? - Fuck me, I will! They made me sad. - Why sad? You think it's normal to jerk off at the cinema? - Dunno, not really. But... It's not their fault. We live in a shitty world. It's full of weirdos. I feel sorry for them. Maybe other people feel sorry for us. What do you say? - Right. Come on, cheer up. Check out this ring. Looks expensive. Look at the colours. What's wrong now? - I'm fed up. Listen, I'm going home. - What do you mean? What can I do? I'm broke. - We'll sell the ring. Yeah, sure. You think it's easy? Who to? Who? Dunno. We can try. Just need some initiative. I'll take care of it. Stop! Well? Listen, you wouldn't happen to be interested in... I'm only interested in where we're meant to be going. Nowhere. - We've already arrived. Stupid girls! Sluts! Scum! Shitfaces! Shitfaces! Skunks! You call that initiative? That one would've sent us right to hospital. I might be fanatical about caution... But let it go. Why did it occur to you to stop that old jerk? Alright. OK. But a good friend of mine told me that too. If you want any information, ask a cab driver. But it depends on the cab driver. Better get your head round before getting into the cab. Alright. Hey! Look at him! What do you say? He looks like the right guy. - Maybe. I rather like him. Let's get in. - Think it over, you never know. Sure but not too long. Watch out! We'll lose him. - Let's stop him! Taxi! - Quick! So? Where to? We don't know yet. Just drive. "Just Drive" A song by the Maestro Nocita. So that's what I'll do. Do you have a place? Pardon? What place? I thought we'd have a threesome. - A threesome? Where's the harm? Wouldn't be the first time. Women are big sluts. Yes, how can I put it? They're whores. Speaking of which, your mother? I never met her. What do you think? Not bad, but your finger-nails are dirty. - Fuck you! She was talking about the ring, come on! - Well... I can't see it if I'm driving. I'd better pull over. Well? Let's have a look at this ring. What kind of stone is this? It's a precious stone. We need to see if it's real. - It's real! Quite real. We need to sell it immediately. If you want, we can split the money. If I want to? Sure I do. Stolen? Does it matter? No. You're happy to split the money as well? - I don't have a choice. What are your names? - I'm Suzy. - Angela. I'm Vito. Where are you from? - Who? Me? No, my granny. - From Milan. But my parents are southerners. We hadn't noticed. Turn off the meter! You want to charge us? Relax, it's a free ride. This is music! Let me sing a song with you... Because, if tomorrow... my love, I shan't see you... Where are we going? - What day is it today? If I'm not mistaken tomorrow's Friday. I don't give a fuck if tomorrow's Friday, Sunday or Monday... The cab's mine, I work when I want, I'm no slave. I used to be an actor. - You don't say! - But always playing waiters, peasants... So I quit. Then I did comics, commercials. I hate commercials. - Yeah, what a bummer. But the money's good. Then, all of a sudden, I put on 20kg and had to I quit. How come? - If you want to be an actor you have to be thin, right? Indeed, I... lost weight. But from hunger. In the meantime, the new generations were coming up. Faggots. - Whereas you with your morals... What morals? A guy comes and asks me: "Do you want to do porn movies?" The moral: you did them. - Of course. Actually, I was talented too. That guy said it was stuff for the foreign market. Maybe! One day the cops arrived... When they arrested me I was completely naked! I'll be right back. I've got to check something. Where is he going? Can we trust him? Personally, I don't trust anyone. And you're right. I've found a place. Ladies and gentlemen. No, friends... The management of this club never lets you down... and there's another surprise for you tonight. Can you guess? No? I'll tell you. Just for you, the fantastic... the dynamic, the inimitable... the irresistible... Raul Casadei! You are my... dearest. Dearest. Your smile... is a song... on that pretty face without make-up. I'd give you anything you want... but you never ask for anything, you just give! And you're happy... even with little things. A caress and a bit of passion.... and you're satisfied... Let's sit over there. - ...with a lie... Are you sure it's the right place? - Of course, relax. Come on, kiss each other at tango passionate hot lips So, what we are doing here? We're looking for the guy who'll help us sell the ring. Great, so we have to split the money with him, right? It doesn't suit you? ...and dream of the Moon this tango of love will bring you luck. Alright. - He says it's alright. - Ah, thank you. We didn't understand. May I have a dance with you? - I don't know the step but I'll try. Angela really sends people crazy. Do you want to dance? May I? - About time. Did you have to wait so long.. ...to come and get that idiot off my balls? They're graceful. - Go to hell. Do you think they're lesbians? - How do I know? I'm the way you see me I'm not the way you want me. And even if you tried you can't change me anymore. I like her. - Fuck you! The night, the whiskey, the bar and you, have done with it and don't complain anymore. I'm waiting for midnight to live with you but you tell me it's late. It's bedtime. It won't work! -You are offended because she left you in the middle of the room. - But go! - Then have fun! Come on, let's go. - We had fun. We're leaving? Where are we going? Let's go. - Are they trustworthy? Everyone's watching them. They need to keep calm. What a strange guy. - Let's go. You know why? Because these friends of mine are suspicious people. This is the Pisciotta gang. Hey, Mario! Mario? Hi, Salvatore, how are you? What are you doing here? Hello, Pino. - Hello. What's going on? Where's Mario? Look at him! My Mario! It was... - Quiet! For God's sake. Hush you. Why don't you call the police? - The police? The police... will never enter my home. - What about him? Who are they? What do they want? They're trying to sell a ring. That's why I brought them. I thought Mario would be interested. That's all. My Mario! They've butchered him! Look what they've done to his face! Look at the state of him. Don't worry, if Death said he'll come, then he'll come... Then he'll fix everything and Mario will be handsome like before. Death? - Yes. He has the magic hands? - Yes. He said okay. One moment. I heard there's a ring for sale. May I see it? We're not selling it anymore. - That's right. What do you mean? Wait! We're not selling it anymore! - Just a moment! We just want to leave. You can't do this to me. I've wasted a night because of you. You can't go now and leave me out of the blue. Where did you find these bitches? Those were willing to get the ring. - The police would get us too. Police? Do me a favour! - Hey, you! What do you want? Because of you, I lost a big stash of money, got it? Fuck off, you jinxed hillbilly! - I'll break your face! - Put your hands down, asshole! - THAT'S ENOUGH ! Let's not mess around. After all, we're all in the same situation. What? In the same situation? You piece of shit! YOU HAVE THE RING! Stop it! - Let's go. - Look, I know you! - But do you want to finish it, yes or no? Stop it! Come on, let's go. Fuck you. Fuck! Can anyone be dumber than him? Come on, stop it. There's no need to drag it out. Hey, Vito, where are you taking us? Where am I taking you? Here, drink, come on. -but I'm supposed to be a teetotaler. Okay, just to keep you company. Not bad for someone who's a teetotaler. Are you laughing at me? - No, I just had an idea. Another one? - If I tell you it's an idea, it's an idea. So far, you've been nothing but trouble. Anyhow... Come on! Have a little faith in our Vito. Come on, let's go. No, sweetheart. Thank you, indeed. You've put on weight, eh. Darling, how am I supposed to get a ring? It's a bad period. No-one gets a hard-on. If it was summer. Listen. How do you want it? In cash? Tough choice, eh? So, nothing? - Dunno, sweetie. Let me think. Let's see... Hi, Mifai! - Hi! How's it going? Friends! Who's he? - Nothing, he kills me! He says that to all the clients. He wants to make a good impression. Wait a moment! How silly of me! Today's Thursday. There's a party at Destiny's. Oh, God! I haven't been invited because of Lola's bitchiness. But... If I take you with me... A lot of people will be there. You might find someone. She's too funny. - Let's go. Yes, let's go. Easy! It's a genuine lam? shawl. So, where to? - Via della Desiderata. Well done! What lovely faces! Sabrina Rapetti. We keep on meeting people tonight. An avalanche. The next one will be Gianni Agnelli. - Who's he? May I? Sabrina Rapetti. Suzy Wong. - Angela Davy. Foreigners? Have you been friends for long? - All our lives, sweethearts. OUT OF ORDER This fucking climbing! I've told Destiny many times. This lift is always broken. By the way! Be nice to Destiny. You, Vito, kiss her hand. What's it to you? - Why's she called that? Oh, it's a foible of hers. She took it from Wanda Osiris. No matter what happened, Wanda always used to say: "Destiny!" She was crazy about Wanda. Sentimental this never-ending night... Some day, I'll imitate her. I'm good at it! Come upstairs. Behave yourselves. Ah, Sabrina. With you. I need to reckon with you, Sabrina. But... I want everyone to be happy tonight. Everyone. Welcome to the castle. Sweethearts. Who are these? New ones? - Dear, they're two real women. Sure. I am too. I'm Angela. - I'm Suzy. Oh, my! They're real! Why are they here? - Don't worry, I'll explain later. For you. - For me? What a lovely gift, dear. What's your name? Vito. - Vito? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, these are my friends. You all know Sabrina. That girl sitting over there... is Paola. Then, Dolores, Nunzia, La Calabrotta... And... this gentleman here... I forgot... Ah, yes! Ruggero. If I'm not mistaken. I don't know the soldiers. Then, Tosca... So, he's Vito. Susy, Angela, Sabrina, always the same Sabrina, and then my two sweeties. I didn't introduce that wild nymphomaniac girl on purpose. She comes every Thursday and says she'll call the police if I don't let her in. Mind you! I'm intimate with a few police chiefs, you know. Sweetheart. Do you mind giving me a leg up? Wait. There... Up! That's it. Gianni? Giannino? I'm going to break all my nails this way, Gianni. Thanks! Gianni! Here comes Gianni! I've called you because, you know, I'll break my nails. He never does anything. He doesn't look it but he's very strong. Have a seat, dear. Voil?! And now, ladies and gentlemen, our star! Lights! I won't play anymore I'm leaving I won't play anymore, for real Life is an unmade bed I'll take what I find and I'll leave it behind. I won't play anymore... - She won't. - # I don't play anymore... # - Well done! - # ..I'm leaving. # - Thank you. - Sit here. And now, our second star. "Et voil?"! Here I am, I've got something on my mind Look at me, it beats without stopping. Believe me, on my very mind Listen to me. What am I looking for? What do I want? I really don't know! Notice we have the graceful Sabrina with us tonight? I'd like to propose a number we used to do a few years ago. Come, Sabrina! Come! You too, silly blondie. Oh, how careless! Sorry. Who's more happy than me? I want to forget you My heart told me: if you search, you'll find love As long as you're young you smile more and more Woman is a flower, I give you scent but it always poisons you Love plays an eternal game with the heart... Thank you, my friends! - You were wonderful! The radio bird. Thank you, sweeties. Gianni's cute, isn't he? Pity he's always looking for money. Achtung, achtung. I'll fetch you a drink. Are you his man? - Me? That guy's man? I'm not "that guy". My name's Destiny. I can hear you from afar, you know. I've got good ears. Do you go out with women? - And you? Do you go out with men? I do, with men. - Well? I'm a man. - We'll see about that. Listen. If you want, you can see about it now. So? Where are we now? The seduction scene? Sabrina! Ugly bitch! You'll pay for this! No, honey. What are you thinking? They want to sell a wonderful ring. A ring? - Indeed. Let's try to make it short. Ladies and gentlemen, or vice versa. We have a wonderful item. An item you'll all be interested in. A marvellous ring of... Give it here. Here! This one! - Let me see! This marvellous coloured stone. This stone is worth at least... 5,000 lire. - Gosh! - Bullshit. Sorry? - I said "bullshit". Sorry? - It's worth less than half that. Because I know. I'm from "Ramoc", in the jewelry trade. Yes, it might be worth a million in a shop. Let's make it a half since you're in a hurry. The other half because... Or am I mistaken? It would be half a million but I'll give you 300,000 lire because that's all I've got. 100, 100 and 100. At this hour, you won't get a better offer. You're not stupid, are you? - No. - Have you got the money on you? Thanks, big spender! Then again, thanks, my ass. It's you who got a bargain. Yes, it went well for you. Are there 10 grands for me? Gianni what? Mind your own fucking business! Old trash! Excuse me, I need use the restroom. You can call it the toilet, sweetheart. Over there. Careful not to wet the floorboards. - Relax, I've got good aim. Fuck you. What a crappy bathroom. You can't even stand up in here. Don't worry about me. I'll wait. - What's with you? It's 100,000 each. - No, it's not about the dough. Then what is it? - I was just thinking... What the fuck are we doing here with these people? Can you tell me? Come on! They're not unpleasant, come on. So what? That's not what I meant. And why are we mixed up with them? After all, we're different. Hey! Isn't that right? Holy fuck, what nonsense! Of course we're different. Stop bringing me down. Yes, maybe you're right. Hey, cutie. What are your intentions with Gianni? No dirty tricks, alright? - What dirty tricks? Because... I'm kind and sweet, but... No dirty tricks. Is that clear? Clear. Quite clear. Look, she doesn't give a damn about Gianni. I know Suzy very well. - Please. Look at my face. - No, come on. It's all falling apart. Come on, cheer up! - Then... I asked you something else. Two little tucks... A facial, a face-lift, lose the chin, and everything will be fine! Sure. - Long live Italy and Go Savoias! - Go Savoias, yes. Sweetheart, if that face doesn't work, there's an extra one! Right, one taste and they'll be back! Evening! Didn't you lock it? - Sure I did. Well, are we going to stand here looking at each other? Come on. Okay, let's go. Good Heavens, in a cab? In the middle of the street! -That's how they do it nowadays. Come on, let's go. Well, we're here. - But what is all this haste? Wait a minute, come on. - Sorry but I have to go. - But not now, let's go around, it's early. Come on, I offer, stay. Yes, if I don't go back to sleep at Destiny tonight, where am I going tomorrow? - You don't have a job? - Why, do you have something to offer me? How rude of Gianni, leaving like that. He didn't convince me. "Do you have anything to offer me?" He says. They want everything on a plate. In my days, I always looked for work myself. Always! Speaking of plates, I'm starving. Can't we get something to eat? - Yes, now I'm hungry too. Listen, while we're here, and not that I don't trust you... Shall we split the money? Okay, agreed. Fuck no! Impossible! - What's impossible? That I'm such a dumb bitch, that's what! That fucking faggot stole my money! Are you sure? - Don't you believe me? Let me see. - I checked, it's gone! This isn't the end of it. I know where they live. What's going on? Same old story? Come on, Destiny. Open up! Open up, I tell you! You'd better open up. Every morning the same old story. - Yes, Ottavio. Call 911. Open up! - What's all this fuss about? I'll call the police. Ugly bitch! Tell your faggot that if he doesn't give us back 300,000... If he stole it from your sluts, he did well! Fuck off! I'm not afraid of you! He did well! Go away! Jerk! Ugly... Hillbilly. Fuck! - What are we gonna do now? Let's get out of here. And now... Don't make that face, bring out the money. That bitch nearly broke my hand. - Poor thing. This has never happened to me before. To get mugged while shagging. 100. - How could it happen? - The other 200,000 are ours. Indeed. It was ours. What 300,000? No fucking way! - Well I'm still hungry. If you slow down and don't make me vomit I confess I'm even more hungry. Me too. I'll buy you a pizza. - What a gentleman! To me, a pizza capricciosa is the best. With all those lovely things on top. Mushrooms, hard-boiled egg, ham... Black olives. Capers! But my father, he said it was a con... Better to order two plain pizzas. You save and you get more. He may have a point. Say, aren't those two legs? Stay calm! I can't do a fucking thing otherwise. Nobody move! We caught you, huh? - Get out of there! Come on, hurry! Hurry up! Out, I said! Over there. Against the car. Search them. Very smart, in the middle of the street. What have you done to her? Robbery? Rape? Torture? Come on, answer me! Is this a joke? We were passing by. We saw the car, the feet... Two feet! - Yes. - Out of the window. Let's see. Kidnapping. Attempted rape. Maybe acts of indecency in public. Robbery and resisting the police. - The police? Want to see my badge? No, on the contrary. Lieutenant, I wanted to tell you... Hold still! One more step and I'll kill you. I'm Captain, not Lieutenant, got it? - Yes, Captain. This is crazy! Why don't you ask her if we did it? You're right. We forgot about the lady. Out of the way. Criminals! Swines! Rascals! Bandits! Skunks! They've robbed me of everything. They wanted to kill me! They even raped me! It's not true. - Freeze or I'll shoot. What's she saying? - It was her! She's a sex maniac! Well? How do you explain this? Listen, let's be reasonable. I told you to stand still. Get up, it's nothing. You're not dead. The look on your face! Son of a bitch! I'll kill you! - What do you want? - I'll kill you! - Enough! Try to be funny. - I am funny! Don't move, this one's real! Here we go, another gun. You need to enjoy joking. Piero, get my shoes from the car. I enjoy joking. So this gun's real? Say, why don't you shoot me in the mouth? Come on, shoot! - Don't talk bullshit. I told you it was real. They're crazy! Come on, let's get out of here. My headlamp! You're going to pay for that otherwise I'll report all three of you. Sure, we'll pay for the headlamp, we'll pay to have your suit cleaned... the soap for your hands the ECG for your butt... Whatever you want! Someone's laughing, at last. - Sure, but it's a bit of a dumb joke. Well, since you fell for it, you're a bit stupid too. - What do you mean? Seems obvious to me. Bye, guys. - Say... Why don't you come over? We'll eat together. Eat? Sure! I'm starving. Vito, please, let's go. Also because we'll pay for the damage when we arrive home. Alright. We haven't introduced ourselves. - Vito. Suzy. - Angela. - Piero. - Marta. Good thing no-one's missing. Look, did you notice? I don't know how but we keep going in and out of toilets tonight. Anyway, this one's an excellent toilet. I'd say this one's the king of toilets. - Right. Pity about those damaged paintings. They've cut them for real. Well, Marta must've torn them. She looks like a hysteric. Sure, the rich are strange animals. Look how many dressing gowns! - They must've put them for us. - Right. I'll take this one. How do I look? Pink flatters me. What a selection of perfumes. One could set up a shop. My throat's dry. Just listen to me! Well, to me, Marta... that is, Davide must be her husband. And Piero, her lover. Or... I for one don't give a damn. Good. Now, I'll put it on again. I can't make anything out in this house. Where have they gone? - I've no idea. Noticed how funny? - Ah, this is the American one who killed herself for love. - Oh yes ? Don't start again, you two. You're such a pain in the ass, Piero. Afraid of water? Look at that. A swimming pool in the courtyard. - Come down! You aren't modest like your friend Vito, are you? Modest? Us? - Why don't we go? - What? Another bath? Come on. Let's dive in. Have you made up your mind? And with this one... I'll feel fine for a month. A nice dive! Good girls. It's hot! - Why? You wanted it cold? Hot water today? Such luxury! So, brute? You're the only one left out. You forgot your socks. Sorry, I hadn't noticed. Never mind, the important thing is not to wring them out. Cute! - Eh! Down. - No ! Send me under. And I'll follow you to the depths. - No, I can't touch the bottom. - I can. Okay, that's enough. Let's go next door, I've set the table. How nice! We do want to eat. - About time! Yes, I'm ravenously hungry. Get the bath robes. - Sure. Your Vito looks great. He's muscled as a rich guy, right? What do you mean by that? Well, what Marta means to say... Do you mind? The poor people have muscles stick to the bones like sandwiches. A matter of nutrition, I guess. - Instead? Instead, our Vito... For you. - Thank you. Shouldn't we get dressed first? - Well, maybe we should. After all, we are not in a brothel. Cheers! Hey, try this. Nice, isn't it? - What is it? - Pat?. Pat?. - Ah, the pat?. I didn't notice. Listen, would you pour me some champagne? - Yes. So many things! Who made the dinner? - Nobody. We have fairies in the house. A nice convenience since we have guests every night. Are you sure you're comfortable there? Yes. You have to excuse me, but... I have to eat at a table. Or else I'd throw up. Please, let's not go into details. It's for the best. Listen, do you want to play with me? At cards. For money, of course. I don't have any. I'll lend you some. - No, I hate losing. Yes, Vito's right. It isn't wise to take risks. Especially with money, right? Come with me, I want to show you something. Come on. Come. Don't you want a drink? Whiskey for you two. And for you... An almond based liquor, red wine, mandarinetto... - Yes, I... - Look here. Do you like ? Well? Well, it's... - It's worth a lot of money. I can't give you this one. Something else, perhaps. The jacket! Do you like my jacket? What are they doing? Well, it is nice... - Try it on. Go on, put it on. Piero, go get the ice. What do you say? How do I look? Mm... Nice. You look like a waiter. Sure, the trousers don't match. - No, you look great. Really. It suits you more than Davide. Right, Davide? - Absolutely, it's yours. Really? No, thanks, it's not needed anymore. Put it down there. I told you it's yours. All-inclusive. Do you mind? - Maybe a bit because of the jacket. It was mine once. It's very strange about that jacket. It's a game, you get used to it. - A game? One time it's a jacket, another time a coat... Anyway, there's always some money in it. They did the same to you too, right? Of course. Do you want to make love with me? - Of course. No... Not like that! No! I've never done that before! Where did Marta go? - I'm coming, stop moaning. Well? Can you do it or not? Well... What's does it matter? I've just never done it before. I knew we'd get to this "no", "I don't feel like doing it" "I've never done it"... Do you like getting cigarette burns? - What? A cigarette on your ass, ever tried it? No, you're nuts. I'm... - She's joking, don't worry. I know you're not a professional but a little enthusiasm, for fuck sake. Well, maybe... I'd better get involved. If not, we won't make it before dawn. Perhaps I should go for a walk. Hi, were you sleeping? No, not again. Are you English? Not again. I want to sleep, dammit! Do you understand! Go away! I want to sleep! Out! No need get upset about it. Ah, well, You still haven't gotten very far. Ugh, here she comes. No, no... Just pretend I'm not here. Yes, but it'd be better if you hadn't come. That's what you say. Besides, Piero hasn't decided yet. Am I right? Come on. Behave. Ugly slut! Stupid! - Are you crazy? Stop that! Please, cut that out. Actually get out everyone because tonight I've really had it. Come on! I'm leaving, Marta. Will you tell Davide? - With her? Are you ready? Bye. Get back! - What else do you want? Give it to me! Thief! - Stop it! What the fuck is going on? - He stole my golden Cartier. It's not true. He's bullshitting. - Of course he stole it! Everyone steals. You should be used to it by now. - Here it is! And now I'll take my money back. See? He had it. Give it to him, he'll need to take a cab to get back to his cab. Besides, isn't his headlamp broken? - But... I told you to give it to him. It's my money. Where are you going? - I'm leaving. Keep it! Piero! Watch out! This isn't a hotel. If you leave you can't come back. Ok, that's for me to decide. Go. We'll discuss it later. Don't go, Piero! That girl... That girl is a bitch, starved to death. You too are starved to death. Come on, take heart, they will have gone to look for food. Well, they were starving. Excuse me? May I have a Coca-Cola? Thanks goodness! Someone dying of thirst. Susy... Wait a minute. Susy... Wait. Where are you going? - Do you care? Well, no. No. I'm going to the station! I'll catch the first train... Susy! - Wait, I'll take you. - No, thanks. It doesn't matter. Without papers, it's 20,000. I don't have it. I've got it. Sorry, I don't know what's happening to me tonight. Don't worry, it doesn't matter. - It does, at least to me. Don't think about it. It happens sometimes. Please, don't start consoling me. Come on, Piero! Sure... This romantic flight wasn't worth the trouble, was it? Go on, say it! do you lack the courage? If you're going to be like that then go ahead. I already told you it doesn't matter. Relax. Go to sleep now. We've got time. Susy? Susy? Susy? Susy? I'm not Suzy, I'm La Mariuccia. Hello. I knew you it was you. - Really? And you remained silent? Yup. The ring! An old loan shark... A little distracted.
