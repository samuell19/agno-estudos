[MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ninja, show your stuff. Just leave Mariko and the child. I'll spare your life. -You want me to leave them alone? You'll have to kill me first. -You want to kill my brother? Kill me first. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Get away. -Brother! -Take care of the child first. Go. -What about you? -Run! -Just run. -Princess-- Princess-- -Go. -Brother, I-- -Run! -Princess! -Run! -Princess-- Princess, run. Get away. Princess! Brother! -Get away. Get away now. -Get going. [MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN: Tiger, there's a guest leaving. Come back next time. -Hey, come inside. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come in. -I'm good. -Hey, come on. -No thanks. No thanks. -Come on. Come on, pretty girls. -Are you Mr. Tiger? -Why yes. That's me. What's the matter? -Well I heard this joint is the best in town. -What a good fellow. You're right. -How much? -How much? Your money's no good in here. Don't you know that we don't want three types of customer. I'm very sorry. -What three types? -No under age. It's not ethical, and it's illegal of course. -I'm over 30. -And no fat belly too. It's too dangerous, and the girls don't like it. -Oh well, Tiger. Who cares about a big belly? Hey handsome. Let me take care of you. -Hey, what about the house rules? There's still one customer we don't take. -What type? -Just like you, drunkard. Get lost. -Drunkenness must run in the family. What a big deal if I'm drunk? [HICCUP] -Of course it's a big deal. It really does matter because if you're drunk, it affects your performance. And it may take a long time before you get out of the bed. You see? -Hey, Tiger. This is a bad season. Who cares? Business is business. If the customer takes a long time, maybe he'll be a little bit tired. But I can take care of him. Hey, come on. I'll take care of you. Come on. -Hey, come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, young man. Don't just look. Why don't you go in? -Me? No, no. -Hey, you're a big fellow. Are you a virgin, or what? -A virgin? You got to be joking. -You mean you've done it? Who with? Your maid? -No, no no. I just play with myself. That's what I do. -You-- you play with yourself. We've got pretty girls in there. Why don't you go try it out. Come on. -No. No, no. Forget it. -Hey, come on. Don't be shy. They're good. -I can't. I can't. Those girls, they don't know my style. -You've got to be joking. They're going to satisfy you. -Hey, young man. I don't care what style you want. Just come on in. -Yeah, go on. Go on. Get in there. -Hey, little Tiger. Come on. -Master. -Keep your voice down. How's the business going? -It's pretty good. You got a full house. -Oh, that's good. Remember, don't call me Master. OK? Now I'm off. -See you later. Come on. Come on. Come in. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, come on. Come on, pretty girls. Come on, everybody. Come in, the girls are beautiful inside. Satisfaction guaranteed. They're very good. You got to try it. [SCREAMING] -What the hell are you doing? I'm not the one who's screaming. -Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were making all that noise. -Mai Lin, what's the matter? -I'm coming. That's why I'm screaming. -What? What are you talking about? I didn't even drop my pants yet. -If I'm not coming right now, what are you going to do, huh? -Mai Lin, you're not even doing it, and you're screaming like hell. What's going to happen when he comes all over you? -Well, what is it to you? Get lost. -You're crazy. -Hey, hey. Mr. Woo, you can't go. Don't leave me here. Stop going. Hey. -Mr. Woo, what's the matter? -I told you. She won't play it my way. -Hey lady, what's the matter with you? This isn't your first or second or third time-- -But he-- he wants a free fuck. -I told you. She won't do it. -Listen, man. Who the hell do you think you are? People pay to fuck. -What are you going to do about it? -What can I do? I'll show you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Want a free fuck? You better leave your clothes behind before you leave this place. You're shit. Go on, get lost. Hey, welcome, welcome, welcome. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come inside. [LAUGH] -After 18 years, I finally become the Grand Master. This time I have a chance to come here, and I tell you that it's all because of Fugiko and Sakura. You will get your reward. After our mission is completed, I will reward all who are faithful. -Grand Master-- -Did you find them? -No, they ran away. -This is the law. Reward for success. But if you fail, then you must die. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What's going on? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Turn your head and turn your soul. Beautiful girls for everyone. I don't care how good you are. Just come in and try us out. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Come on in, everyone. -Hello, you want to try the Japanese style? -We have girls too. Hey, don't you know the rules around here? You're opening a whorehouse. You shouldn't make it so obvious. Aren't you afraid the police are going to come? -Don't you forget that this is Japanese territory. You should be the one who's afraid. -Shit. -Hi! -Hey, what are you doing? -That man is too much. Oh God, I can't stand it any more. OK buddy, I'm going. Sayonara. Come on. -Good bye, and thank you. I hope to see you again. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Sakura, how is it? Does he got a plum sign on his chest? -I didn't see it. That kid is smart. -The Grand Master wants the news bad. All the ninja are out to look for them. If we can't find them first, we'll be in a real big trouble. Got that? -I can only spy on him at the front door. -It's not enough. We must find out who it is at all cost. -Yes, I will, brother. -Try to get close to him. I'm going. -Now come on in. Come on in. Come on in. Come back next time. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Now sir, this one is the best room we've got. Now take care of him. -I will. -I'll tell you, I'll be rich for the rest of my life. I tell you-- -Here, have some tea. -If I become rich, I won't forget you, sweetheart. -Forget it, man. Stop dreaming again. -Hey, you just don't believe me. Do you? -Yes, I don't believe you. -All right, I'll tell you everything. Listen to me. Last time I saw some guys, and they were carrying stuff in and out of the mansion. I think there are many treasures in that house. All I got to do is steal it, then-- -Now I know you're dreaming. -You think I'm getting sick, huh? -I really do. I think you are sick. -No, no. You'll see. I'm going to make it. And after that, well I'm going to marry you. What do you say, huh? -Right. I'm going to tell Master. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Master! Master, Master! Master, come out. -How do you know there's trouble? -Master, Master. Master, Master! -Tiger, keep your voice down. -Master, you OK? -I am OK. I just had a little fight with a couple of Japanese ninjas. -Huh? Master, why don't you beat the shit out of them? A couple of Japanese are nothing. Even 10 of them, they're not your match. Are they? -Forget it. I'm a beggar. Did you ever hear of a beggar beating up people? -Master, my whorehouse is in trouble. We've got competition. -What competition? -A Japanese whorehouse. [MUSIC PLAYING] MASTER (VOICEOVER): How can it be so soon? -Hey, Suni. -Master. Oh, OK. Come on, guys. Get out. Party is over. Come on. Hurry up. -Tiger-- -What, Master? Master! Master, what are you doing? Master, no! Master-- -Get up. -No, not again. [MUSIC PLAYING] -From now on, I will teach you the highest style of our kung fu. This style consists of seven parts. Each part is very difficult to learn. You will soon be in trouble. That's why from now you have to learn. -Teacher, is this necessary? -Although you've got a good physique, it may be too late. Beggar, the cup. -Yes. -Drink it. -Master, it's a mistake. This is vinegar. I can't drink that. -Everything's all right. Just drink it. Drink it! -Master, it's too sour. I think I'm going to be sick. -Shut up. Just keep your concentration on your mind. Let the blood flow out. Give over your body. Let the air get into your stomach. These feelings are normal. -Teacher! -Beat him! [MUSIC PLAYING] This blood is different from our normal human blood. It can increase body capacity, so you can become a good grand master. This blood is not easy to find. -Is it necessary to go through all this trouble? -Forget it. Just concentrate. -I'm not worried about the game. It's about your student. I just don't understand. -Don't worry, you will one day. -Well, I hope you know what you're doing. I'll take this back. -You can't do that. It's cheating. -OK. I'll see if I can beat you. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I got you. [MUSIC PLAYING] You lose. [FLUTE] [ROAR] [MUSIC STOPS] [LAUGH] -For these few days I've really given you a bad time. I know it. I've never given you such a bad time before. But if we don't train you ahead, by the time you get to real practice, I'm afraid that your body won't be able to handle it. I forced you to do it this way. It's the only way. -I understand, but-- but-- -But what? -Why don't you let me get some fire to warm me up? -Warm fire? -Yeah. -Warm fire will force the cold air into your body. This will kill you right away. What's wrong? Why do you keep shivering like that? -It's just-- I just feel so cold. -That's OK. Come on, walk with me. You'll feel better. Come on. -Master, no, I can't. I can't. -Why-- why not? -It's just I don't want to. -It's nothing. A little walk will help you. -Master. -Yeah? -There's something I want to know. -Tell me. -So many strange things have happened lately. I just can't see the connection. -Sometimes you may not have anything to do with people, but the trouble will still follow you. That's life, I'm afraid. -But I'm poor. I've got no power, no money. Then how would I get into trouble like this? I just don't understand. -I can only explain the facts of life to you. -I think something's wrong. -Stop asking so many questions. I want you look for a blind fortune teller for me. -Blind man? Hey Master, I've got a lot of blind masseurs in my place, but I've never seen a blind fortune teller. Do you think he know the black clothes guys? -I really don't want to tell you the truth before you're practicing better in your kung fu. But those black clothes people are called-- they're called ninjas. -Ninja? What are ninja? Big deal. Master-- -Don't call me Master. Why you're not even 1/10 as good as a ninja. -Master! -You listen to me. These black clothes people are Yi Ho Ling ninja. Somewhere around 100 years ago, there were many lords ruling Japan. These lords were always fighting each other and hiring groups to kill each other. They used them for murder-- to murder each other. Ninjas, they're divided into many streams. Among them, Yi Ho Ling ninja is the best. [MUSIC PLAYING] MASTER (VOICEOVER): A ninja can take a whole lifetime before he completes a mission. Even if he's hurt, he will not give up until death comes. -They are different from regular kung fu masters. You could say they are well-trained real killing machines. It's only death that can stop them. -Master, don't they have any weak points? -They do have a weak point, but only one is the perfect way to kill them. -Which one? -You won't understand even if I tell you now. Well Tiger, go back to the town now. We'll talk tomorrow. OK? -OK. See you later. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Devil mask. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Thank you. Come again. Master, thank you for your help last time. Please come in. -Oh, no. I've got some business to do. -Come on. Try the Japanese style. -Japanese style? No thanks. -We're into the same business. Why don't you exchange the experience. -No, no. I don't do that kind of thing. -You can't even make it? -Are you crazy? -Good. -Hey, no! [GIGGLING] No! You can't do this to me. No. Look, look-- I'm not ready. No! Hey, help me. Hey lady, let me out of here. Come on. Lady, sorry. I'm coming here just-- just-- just for-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh my God! You're a man. Oh no! I don't like homosexuals, not the backdoor. You see? Stay away. Now stay away. Don't hit me. You wouldn't try it. You'll regret it. Ow! Hey! Stay away from me. I haven't taken a bath for three months. Do you understand that? Three months, no bath. Hm. I didn't think I was that sexy. Just stay away from me. You Japanese are crazy, you bisexual idiot. Hey, there you go again. No way, Jose. I'm getting out of here. -How is it? Did you see it? -Hey, everybody's got the same thing. Look at what, huh? -Thank you. -Thank you for coming. -Come again. -Thank you, bye. -Good night. -Fuck this. [MUSIC PLAYING] -No escape. Why not make a good move? I won't run away again. Ha! -This is for you. Hey? You have such bad taste, you must be crazy for flowers. -Hm. If I was crazy for flowers, you wouldn't be the one I'd pick. You're so young and inexperienced. -Me, inexperienced? You know what they call me? They call me pile driver, specialize in digging a hole. Eh, see you? -Pile driver, huh? Come on, forget it. Last time you ran like hell, and you're saying that you're good. -What a joke. Who do you think I am? I'm a lion. -I think you better let our girls teach you. You want to try it, huh? -Those girls? I don't like them. They're all dogs. See you later. Bye. -Come on. This way, please. -Oh? Oh, yeah. Oh wow. Let me try, huh? Oh, same as usual. [LAUGH] -Hey mister, new arrivals. Come on, this way. Come on. They're beautiful. -I'm not interested. -Come on, quick. -Master, try some more soup. It's not bad. -What's going on? Where did you get the money for this meal from? -Well this-- the business is good, more tips. And the customers, they treat me well. Hey, cheers. Master-- -It's nothing. Go and get me the blue bottle which is under the bed there. [MUSIC PLAYING] TIGER (VOICEOVER): Strange. How come Master's got these things? -Hey Tiger, how come it takes so long to get the bottle for me? -Oh, coming. Master, here it is. Say Master, did you know that the monk mansion is possessed? -Monk mansion-- who said that? -A drunkard named Chin. -Silly nonsense. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -This style is to try to train you to get the goal up in the high place. -Huh? Master, that's easy. I'm good at that. -Wait. -Master, what's this? Master, this is oil. -Go. -OK. Hey! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh spare me. Master, spare me, spare me. Master-- Master, spare me. Stop it. I give up, Master. I give up. I give up. Spare me, Master. Master, sp-- [YELL] -Are you blind? Hey. -I have nothing to do with you. Why are you following me? Ah last time I let you go. Why have you come back? [LAUGH] Hey, I'm really sorry, sir. -Yeah young fellow, watch your way. Don't you see I'm a blind man? Hey, don't touch my stick. You again, run. Oh sorry. Come on. Have a seat. -Sir, I'm looking for a blind fortune teller. Is that you? -Well I'm a blind fortune teller. Who is your master? -My master is-- what's it to you? -Hey, you tell me. Maybe I could help you. -What are you saying? -Oh I can read your life for free. Is that good enough? TIGER (VOICEOVER): Master asked me to look for the blind guy. He may be the one. -Well my master is Kol Tai. He is the leader of the beggars in here. -OK. I will read your life right away. Your birthday is-- -Oh my birthday is August 15, 1915. -One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-- what do you want to know? -Well lately a bunch of ninja are trying to kill me. I wonder what's going on. That's why I came to you for help. -Oh this is because you have all these troubles in your life. Stay close to one flower. You will have seven dangerous moments to go through. If not, you will die. -So how do I get through them? -Hm, with plum flower. -Plum flower? -Yes. -Hm, plum flower. Plum flower can help me with this. Plum flower can help me with all this? But what is plum flower? Ah, it might mean a girl But I can't touch a girl. I've been saving it for just the right girl. Hm, plum flower-- What it is plum flower? What is the damn thing? What a joke. Ow. Plum flower, plum flower, plum flower-- -Are you calling me? You must be desperate. -Leave me alone. -Oh, come on. What's the matter? If you're desperate, maybe I can help. I haven't got a customer tonight anyway. -Hey, no thanks, girl. -This soup is for you. Maybe after you drink it, you'll become a man. -Hey, get the hell out of here. Go away. Buzz off. Go on, get the money. Out, out! What a cow. Plum flower, plum flower, plum flower-- [MUSIC PLAYING] [STRUGGLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Anybody who has a plum sign is your master. -Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh! -Master. -This is weird. The blind guy said I needed plum flower to help me live through this, to assist me in this. I better go and ask the Master. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] -Master! Master, Master! [MUSIC PLAYING] Everybody, run for your lives. Otherwise it will be too late. Run! Run, everybody! Little Pan, Little Pan! Mai Lin, Mai Lin! God, who did this? Who did this mother fuckers? Come out!

[SCREAMING] -What's your boss's name? -I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! -I don't know! -We don't know. -Ladies, 10 years of this research, all wasted. -No, no, no! -I ask you once more. Is there any tattoo on Tiger's body? -No. He doesn't have a tattoo on his body. No. No really, he doesn't. No! -He doesn't. [SCREAMING] -18 years ago the war on Plum Hill destroyed my entire family. Me and my sister were following the Master and looking for the Young Master. We seek revenge. -What? You mean the princess is still alive? -Yes, she is. -Master! -Tiger! -Let him go. -Tiger! -Don't worry about me, Master. This guy gave me trouble before. If he gives you trouble, I'll kill him. -No, Tiger! Tiger! Tiger, stop fighting. He is one of us. -Master, what are you saying? -Young Master-- Tiger, let me tell you everything. 40 years ago there were many pirates and Japanese immigrants living on the main shore of mainland China. Most of the Japanese residents were Yo Hu La ninja. Our village was destroyed. It was destroyed by a group of ninja. Only three children survived the massacre. I am one of them. The other is the blind fortune teller. Your-- your father is the third. The one who kept us is also the leader of that group of ninja. He's the Grand Master of them all. [MUSIC PLAYING]
