Excuse me, blind man. The bridge is full of holes. Be careful where you step. Oh, thank you kindly for warning me. I must say, hearing the sound of a shamisen is always pleasant. Where are you headed? Well, I wonder where I'll end up. I have no particular destination. How about you? I'm on way to see my daughter who lives in Kannon'ura in Choshi. I see. Kannon'ura is a merry place. I hear brothels line its streets. Do you know a brothel called Ogiya, by any chance? Kannon'ura... is a place where the blind have no business going. Well, good-bye. - Take care. Excuse me. It's just a small amount. I hope you won't be offended. You're giving it to me? Yes. I thank you for your kindness. Hello? Hello? Uncle? Uncle? Uncle? Oh, no! Why did you do this? How could you kill yourself? ZATOICHI IN DESPERATION Why did you kill yourself, darling? Excuse me, could you tell me if there is a place called Ogiya around here? I'll take you there. You know where Ogiya is? Yeah. Come on, come on. Oh, mister. Just this afternoon, we were talking about you. Weren't we? Please come in. Take your time and enjoy. Okimi! Okimil! Now, where is Namiji? You really are a blunderer! Find her, idiot! OGIYA Tome! Tome! You're so handsome. Thank you very much. Thank you, please come again. Welcome. Just this afternoon, we were talking about you. Escort our guest! Is this place Ogiya? It is. I came to see a woman who is employed here. She has a mother who plays shamisen well. Her mother plays shamisen well? What's the girl's name? I don't know her name ‒ Welcome. Please have a look. Which girl, sir? - This girl, - You have a good eye. Hey, escort our guest! - Excuse me. - How old is she? I'm not quite sure how old she is. Where is she from? - Where she was born? - That's right. I'm not quite sure where she was born. You know nothing about her, then. Yes, so ‒ Did you come here to play a joke on me? I don't have time to waste on the likes of you! Go on, leave! I'm busy! What? What's this? Excuse me. Welcome. So, what is her mother's name? Well. Can you take a look at this? This? All right. Let's see. There's writing that says “Nobu.” That must be her mother's name. It's a nice name. Well, then. Come with me to the back room. I'll find the girl for you. Let's go to the back room. So it must have been tough to find your way here. Thank you for taking the trouble. - Do you need help with your sandals? - I'm fine. Thank you for waiting. So, the girl you're looking for is a prostitute? I'm not sure, but she might be. What? You don't even know that? Well, the thing is, there are 17 prostitutes alone. If we count all our womenfolk, there will be at least 30. To ask them their mothers' names one by one would be ‒ Well, I guess there's no other way. Wait in here. You won't be bothered by anyone. If somebody asks, say you came to give a massage. Thank you for your help. Ah, this must be a futon storage room. This sort of room smells the same at any place. When I take more than ten men, it feels like I'm dying. Because you get too wet. I can't help it when they have me in all sorts of ways. I wonder if the old woman's daughter is a whore after all. In that case, was she on her way to buy her daughter's freedom? Ushimatsu! How did you get in here? I climbed over the fence in the back. What if you're found? I just had to see you. I have a client waiting. I have to go. Stay with me, just for a few minutes. If somebody finds us, I'll be scolded. You're hurting me, Ushimatsu. I told you, I have a client waiting. No, don't make noise. Come on, hold me tighter. - Ushimatsu. - Hold me. Nishikigi. Nishikigi. I'll die! I'm gonna die! Nishikigi. Nishikigi! Nishikigi? What is this? I've been lucky with games lately. Next time, come through the front. That was awful. I'd like to experience what this “dying” feels like, for once. Nishikigi, that's what she was called. All right, this is it. We"re here. Come on, go inside. I'm sorry it took time. Thank you for your help. Now, come on over here. Where did you find her? She was hiding in a filthy inn in Yokaichiba. I see. You did a great job. Stay and have a good time with us tonight. Thank you. Thank you. What a troublesome girl you are. You think you can run away from here? Fool! What's the idea? This isn't a good place to do the scolding. - All right, come on. - Idiot! Be careful! - Kaede, fetch me some water. - Yes. - Wash them carefully. - Yes. Madam, my term of service has long been over. Why can't I go home? Why? Because you still owe us money. That's a lie! It can't be true. A lie? Are you saying I'm lying to you? - Lock her up in the back. - Yes. Madam, no! Don't lock me up. Madam! - There's no use. You brought it on yourself! - Madam! - Come on! Kaede. You're not supposed to come here. I told you. When will you come home? Tomorrow. Really? Take this money and go home. Kaede, what are you doing? Nothing. I haven't been with a “goddess” in a while. I haven't been with a “goddess” in a while. Be careful not to incur divine punishment. Let's go. My, you're full of surprises. You really are, mister. But I must say, you have a good eye for girls, for setting your eye on Nishikigi. Oh, forgive me. This way. - Thanks. That's Zatoichi. Zatoichi? Is he here to sleep with a whore even though he can't see? There's a price on his head. If you take it to Iioka, you'll get 100 ryo. 100 ryo? That's grand. I brought you some tea, sir. Thanks. Miss, you sound very young. How old are you? I'm 14. You have a mother? No, she's dead. Do you have any family? I have a brother. Why are you peeping into my room? You're a grown man, mister. I heard that you fell in love with me at first sight. Yes. Where did you see me? Well... I didn't exactly see you. But rather, I fell in love with your voice at “first hearing,” if I might say so. Is that right? May I ask... if your mother plays shamisen, by any chance? Yeah, I used to hear her play when I was a little girl. Then, could you... could you take a look at this? Excuse me. Please take a look at this. “Nobu” is written on it. My mother's called Nobu. You know her? No, I don't exactly know her, but... - Kaede, bring me some tea. - Yes. I'm thirsty. Actually, shortly before I came here... she fell into a river near Sakura. Your mother... My mother fell into a river? Then it's as if you had a hand in her death. Tell me, what is required to free you from this place? Why do you want to know? Your girls will be with you shortly. When they are with you, you may lick them or bite them or do whatever you please. “Lick them or bite them,” she said. She's a fright. Well, guys? Even if we stay here, we're not likely to get pretty girls. Wanna take him on instead? We"ll get 20 ryo each. Zatoichi is only a blind bastard. We can take him on. We have to stop by at lioka anyway. He'll make a perfect gift. After all, he's worth 100 ryo. You don't often run into a job like this. Are you following me knowing that I'm Zatoichi? No way for the dumb and the blind to communicate. Kamekichi? Forgive me. You're hurting me. Have mercy. MANGORO KAGIYA MONEY OFFERINGS COLLECTION You get naked for your job anyway. Pay what you owe. Odd. Anybody else? - Even. - Even, all right. I hear even. I didn't expect this would happen. Then what did you expect? I can't give up my fishing net as collateral. Take my wife instead. The cup is down! Please rewrite the collateral! Wait! Odd. I'm betting for odd. Showdown! Four and six. Even! How old is your wife? I think she's over 40. Is she good-looking? Idiot! Who would want such an old hag? As soon as you pay your debt, we'll hand over your paper to you. All right, then. Go home. Go on! Get going now, fool! Anybody for odd? Let's hear it for odd! Odd! Showdown! Five and two. Odd! Excuse me. If you will. Will you let me roll the dice? What? You're blind. How can you roll the dice when you can't see? Yes, I'm a “blind” fool for gambling. Three ryo. Go ahead, then. Hey, here's the cup. Thank you. Wait a minute. You can't use your own dice. Use the house dice. All right. These dice have the character “Man” for the number one. What fine dice. Very well, then. Everybody, as I'm a blind man, please forgive me for any clumsiness. Hey, you ‒ Now, place your bets please. Place your bets. Place your bets. - I'm for odd. - Me too. - We have a game. - Showdown! Four and three. Odd! Well, are these enough to cover my loss? One ryo will do fine. Thank you. Five ryo. He's bold. All right, next game. Place your bets please. Even! Even! Wait a second there. I'll bet three ryo on even. Why isn't anybody betting for odd? Anybody for odd? Any bets for odd? Any bets for odd? No bets for odd, I guess. All right. Showdown! Five and one. Even! I won! Excuse me, everybody. I still have money to bet. It's no fun gambling unless you go all in, isn't it? Everybody, ready? All right, I'm for odd. We'll go all in with our take so far. I'm gonna go for broke. All in for odd. Everybody's betting on odd this time? Anybody for even? Nobody's betting on even. That's how it is, then. Showdown! Damn, these wayward dice must have rolled out of my sleeve. - Hey, wait. - Showdown! Dealer, will you make the call? Guessing from your silence, it's even, isn't it? A double “Man” one. Even. Thank you very much. Since it's even, I win. I'll take everything as my winnings. Thank you, everybody. Wait a minute. Something's fishy. Where are the dice you tossed into your sleeve? Why, they are... in here all intact. You tricked us, saying they rolled out ‒ You've got some nerve, blind bastard. You cheated. Whose gambling house do you think this is? I think it must be a dirty gambling house. Smart-aleck! Why then, all of you men placed your bets on the dice lying outside the cup? What blockhead would call that gambling? In the game of odd-or-even, you place your bets on the dice inside the cup. You want flames of pain burning through your eyes? Beat him up! You've got some lip! Let him have it! Cut him down! Give me back my money. Just give me back my money. Hey! Guys, the Boss is here. Zatoichi! That's your name, isn't it? I hope you enjoyed yourself. Boss, the bastard ‒ And who might you be? I'm Mangoro Kagiya. Why don't you at least give us a greeting? This is a mere token of my visit. Please buy some sake with it. Don't just stand there. Restart the game! Yes! Why did that bastard come here? We have a notice from the boss in Iioka to take out Zatoichi if he turns up. We can't just let him leave. Don't get all worked up. It's just a blind bastard. I'll take care of him. So, that's the head with a 100-ryo reward. How did it go? Are you tired? They say the blind are passionate lovers. Whether passionate or frigid, he hasn't touched me yet. Oh, really? He hasn't touched you the whole night? 20. 30 ryo. With this much money, I should be able to work out a deal. Nishikigi is asking you to come down to Madam's room. Oh, all right. I'll be there right away. I'm sorry for asking you to come down here. Not at all, I'm pleased to come. I just heard this from Nishikigi, but is it true you want to buy her freedom? Yes, it's true. That's all very well, but Nishikigi is our number-one girl ‒ How much would it take to release her? 20? 50 ryo. Could you bring her contract? Yes, right away! Come on, offer him a cushion. I've already told you, didn't I? You're really so slow. Here's the contract for Nishikigi's term of service. Here. Did you get a good look? Kaede, let's go some place far away. We can't. We'll be caught in no time and be beaten if we try to run. Not only me, but you too. That won't happen because we're going into the sea. Into the sea? Yeah. We'll die if we go into the sea. We can be together when we die, right? When my term of service is over, we can be together like this every day. Term of service? Three years. We have to be strong for three more years. We"re brother and sister. One day, we'll be able to live together. When that day comes, we'll build graves for our father and mother. That will work for sure. Did you see what's underneath? Look. The idiot is getting interested in sex like a normal guy. Here, I'll make you feel good. There. There. You like it? You half-wit bastard how dare you spray on me! Damn bastard! Damn you! Hurry. Grandad. Who gave you permission to use this boat? Did you forget that you put it up as collateral? If you wanna use the boat, pay off what you owe us first. You get that? You don't get it, do you? Make them understand. You took my son into the gambling house by force, and you cheated him out of his money with rigged games. How can a fisherman make a living when his boat is taken away? That's not our concern, old fool! I'll take this. Please, don't take it. Please have mercy. We need the net. I was so eagerly awaiting your visit that I was craning my short neck to see you appear. You're as seductive as ever. What a flirt you are. I might take it seriously. Kaede, make a bow. She's a fine girl, isn't she? I feel great. Watching a fire revives me. You came at the perfect time then. How could you burn our boats just because you're not getting your way? How are we going to make a living now? Don't say such a thing. Come on, get up now. Stop mumbling like some bubbling fart in bathwater. If you wanna say something, do it with the sword. There! Pick them up! Come on, draw a sword. You can't draw it? Stupid bastard! It was you. What's this? Brat! Come this way! What's that look! Damn brat! You're a devil! You gonna fight me? Go ahead, cut them down! Kill them! Kaede... Serves them right. Bastard! For one With one throw of the net, each boat was filled with sardines With one throw of the net, each boat was filled with sardines Loud calls came from the boats as they headed into the river mouth Announcing a good haul For two From off the coast of Futama To Tokawa... I hope you appreciate my good faith in bringing 500 ryo in response to your letter. Of course, I appreciate it very much. 500 ryo, all here, indeed. The master is very committed to supporting you. I hope you do your part in return. Sure. I've come too far on this course, I can't turn back now. You can rest easy and count on me. As I wrote in my letter, your help will provide me with a solid foundation. You'll build ships for tuna fishing and even for whaling to start a large-scale fishing operation. And your organization will control the entire harbor. You are an ambitious businessman. Well, the old way of fishing with shabby boats and nets won't do much good in the future. Since we burned all the old boats and nets, the fishermen have no way to replace them. They have no choice but to work for me for very low pay. Let's see, I expect the daily take will be 70 to 80 ryo. Come over here. Not you! You over there! You! Bring her over here quickly! Make a bow. Pour sake for him! You do it! So how are you going to spend the 500 ryo? I plan to use it to grease the palm of Inspector Hosomi really good. He wants you to have a drink, fool! Accept the cup. So, you'll have the inspector by the balls. Aren't you a real pervert. Kaede hasn't learned to drink yet. Let me ‒ What the hell are you doing, fool? Take her away! Don't butt in, bitch! You're coming with me! Come on! This girl is rather pretty. A rare gem of a “clam.” - Oh, my. - What? I'm just saying the truth, aren't I? - What are you doing? - There's a firefly. Look, it's right in front of you. Oh, it's glowing. You smell nice. I only smell nice? Well, you can't see. Sorry. Oh, it's hot. I can't see, but I can tell very well that you're beautiful. Have you ever had a wife? What? Well... She left you? You must have harassed her. Hey. Wait ‒ Uh, I have to go to sleep. All right. Good night. Are you sleepy? Hey. Are you asleep? I can't even tell whether he's asleep or not. Ushimatsu. What do you mean by letting another man buy your freedom? But you couldn't have come up with big money like 50 ryo, could you? Damn! Some of that 50 ryo was my money. The bastard cheated. He's a well-known yakuza called Zatoichi. That ‒ Boss Sukegoro of Iioka has put a reward of 100 ryo on his head. Damn it! When I think that he's making love to you, it's like a dagger to the heart. Damn! I wish there was a way to get you back from him. Don't torment yourself. He hasn't touched me yet. Don't lie! Why don't you find out, then? Is that true? Your body belongs to me. No other man can have it. And yours mine. Ushimatsu. Welcome home. I brought back a fish. What? Oh, I see, a fish. Who's there? Oh, it's me. I dropped the fish. It's a male fish. Should we slice it up into sashimi? Yes, let's do that. We'll do that. I'll lose face if I let you leave empty-handed. Sir. It's only a blind guy we're dealing with. We don't think we would actually require your help. But it would be disrespectful to fight in this town without letting you know. If we fail to Kill Zatoichi, we'll lose our honor as men. We must make him pay for killing Kamekichi. When all four of us together make a coordinated attack, I'm sure we'll be able to take him down, even if it is Zatoichi. Well, I'll come with you. Thank you. We appreciate this. I'm coming with you to watch you get killed by Zatoichi. If they can do the job, that's fine. If not, that's fine too. In any case, I'll have the head of Zatoichi. Why did you free me from the brothel? You haven't touched me at all. Well, I did it for your late mother's sake. I wanted you to live a decent life from now on. What? A decent life? What do you mean by that? Does it mean not sleeping with any man and not prostituting myself? Well, it would be all right to sleep with a man. Which man? A sighted man? Or a blind man? Well, you should marry a man who makes an honest living. And then? And have children and become a mother. And then? And your children will bear more children. And then? And raise them... What a joke. You're talking nonsense. I'm asking you why you freed me from the brothel. Well... Did you do it to make amends for killing my mother? Then you did it to help yourself. Not to help me or anybody else. You did it to ease your conscience. I didn't ask for this. Listen, let me go back to the brothel. I'll pay back your money. I heard that the 50 ryo you used was money you won by gambling. Blind man. Do you want... to see... the color of your blood? You shouldn't tease the blind. Whether the blood is red or black, I wouldn't be able to see it even if I wanted to. I have no grudges against you. Do you insist on fighting regardless? If we let you live, Kamekichi will never rest in peace! That's an odd thing to say. It wasn't me who attacked ‒ Shut up! We'll lose our honor as men if we let you live! Better to lose it and live longer. You die, and you lose everything. Very nice. It looks very good on you. Not many girls are as lucky as you. See? You've got Nishikigi's former room all to yourself. You must be very grateful to the master. All right? And if the master tells you to be a dog, obey him and be a dog. Anyway, let your body do the learning. You understand? - Yes. Kaede, Otsune is calling you. - Go on. - Yes. Kaede. It's about Shinkichi. He's dead. Somebody came with the news just now. Put him in the coffin. Shinkichi, we'll be together forever. What do you say? I'll make it possible for you and Nishikigi to marry. Ushimatsu. Doesn't it upset you that some blind bastard bought the freedom of your beloved Nishikigi? It's hot! Lay off it! Well, of course. Stop it! What's wrong with you? I'm sure Nishikigi wants to be with you too. When all's said and done, women prefer healthy men. So, what do I have to do? Tonight, when Ichi and Nishikigi are busy doing it, you raid their house. What? If everything goes well, I'll give you a wedding present. 50 ryo. 50 ryo... So now, Ushimatsu. Yes. Make sure you persuade Nishikigi to play along. Yes. Boss, a messenger brought this letter from the boss in Iioka. From Iioka? Fool! Don't try to peek! Inosuke. Ichi's head... will be picked up... by the boss of Iioka himself tomorrow. The boss of Iioka himself will come for it? That's amazing. Boss, by taking Ichi's head, you'll be the most powerful boss not only in Shimosa, but in all of Kanto. When that happens, maybe I'll share sake to seal a partnership with the boss of Iioka. That might really come true. Idiot. It might, eh? Why do I have to make love to him as you watch us? Think how I would feel watching it. I'm asking you to do it so that we can be married. So you're saying if I sleep with him just once, I'll be free from him? That's right. I'm saying this, SO you can be free and be my wife. Who gave you this idea? Boss Mangoro did, so it'll go all right. Boss Mangoro did? Yeah. I wonder if you'll be all right, making such promises to Boss Mangoro. If I drink so much, my head will start spinning. No! Ichi! Let me go! No! Ichi! Take me... to where Nishikigi was taken. Listen, Boss Mangoro. Why do I have to be tied up like this? Let me go! Ushimatsu, what happened to Ichi? You've got guts to come here, Ichi. We yakuza are supposed to live off of the leftovers left behind by folks who make an honest living. We live in the dark side of society, hidden from the light of the sun. But instead, you prey on decent people and dare to walk under the sun with impunity. Well, maybe I've gone too far with some things. Say, have a drink and don't be so upset. Nishikigi, come over here. Why don't you go to him, Nishikigi? Boss Mangoro, please. Blind bastard! You can't see it, but we've made sure Nishikigi won't be able to move. Ichi, if you insist on taking her home, then drop your cane sword! Suit yourself! See what happens if you don't do it! Boss Mangoro. Help me, Ichi. Darling. Hey, what are you gonna do? The next harpoon will spear her in the gut. Do it! - No! Wait! Untie her. Ichi. Put your hands on this table. I'll make sure you won't be giving massages anymore. Ushimatsu! I'll let you do it. Those hands fondled Nishikigi. You destroy them. Ushimatsu. Without your cane, you won't be able find your way to the next world, will you? Even the notorious Zatoichi is helpless as a baby without the use of his hands. Let him have his cane at least. Nishikigi? Fool! At dawn, I'll pay you a visit and bring along Nishikigi. Go! Hey, come forward. Ushimatsu, I'm amazed that you brought Zatoichi here. It's all right. You can leave. Hey! Leave by yourself! To the next world. Ushimatsu! Nishikigi. Darling. You wanna go with him? I... I will... go back to Ogiya and... work again... That's the smart thing to do. What it all comes down to in this world is money. You've still got the goods to go back to work. Please enjoy watching as Zatoichi meets his end. It will be a small gift I present to you, Boss of Iioka. Hey, Zatoichi! How are your hands? I took the trouble to pay you a visit. Show your face, at least! What are you guys doing? Kill that freak! Do it quickly! Bastard! Don't come closer! Don't get any closer! Bastard! You bastard! You fool! Why are you still sticking to me? Hey, attack him! Do it, guys! You guys attack him! Damn idiots! Do it, or I kill you! I said attack him! You bastards! Do it! Where are you going? Kill him! What are you ‒ Blind bastard. Don't come this way! Hey, let me in! Let me inside! I'm Mangoro! I'm Mangoro Kagiya! If you don't let me in, you bastard ‒ Bastard! Please, you'll forgive me, won't you? You're merciful, aren't you? You bastard! I'll cut you down, blind bastard! I'm asking for your forgiveness! Forgive me! Come on, forgive me. Just forgive me! I said... forgive me ... didn't I? THE END
