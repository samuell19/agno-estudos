Based on a true story 1974 (Showa 49) Ehime Prefecture Beautiful, simply beautiful. Morning. Morning. Good morning. Where do we work today? - Rin Rin Park. - Where those prize carp are? Planting maple opposite the carp pond. You reckon the owner will tip us big? You coming too, Haruki? Idiot! You know Haruki and I are working for you today. That's right. But how come? Seido! You've got that meeting at Noda's place. Yes, that marriage prospect! You forgot? Damn! I'm going to be late! You are hopeless. I'm borrowing the truck. Hurry it up. Hope this one likes you. Get off my case! Hurry, you're late. Keiko! Morn? I was worried, so I left work early. It's not like it's my first time meeting a marriage prospect. How many so far? At least 20! Mitsuyo! You're coming too, Auntie? To see you set a record for failed arranged marriages. Don't say that! Get out of the way! Be careful. Move! I'm in a hurry! Stop speeding, you idiot! Let me introduce Mr. Seido Takaoka, 32. How do you do? And this is Keiko Aida, she's 27. You're 27? Is that a problem? Not really. This is her mother, Kiyoko. I'm her kin, too. Her grandmother? Don't say that. I'm her aunt. Seido's last prospect was 20 and she wanted nothing to do with him. So he's desperate. That makes sense. She was too young. I wanted nothing to do with HER! Enough of this. Let's just go eat. Well excuse me! Your job is to give us youngsters some freedom. I'd hardly call you two "youngsters." Gimme a break. You probably don't have a good impression of me. So I'll be honest. Please. We're farmers. And we're in debt. Life won't be easy. Debt, you say? How much debt? It'll take 24 years to pay it all off. Do you have tangerine orchards? My dad never planted tangerines. Probably the only farmer in Ehime not growing them. That's why all the debt. So this is where he's brought her. Is that right? Doesn't that bother you? My father worked at a bank, and he always used to say... banks don't lend money to people they think can't handle it. So I doubt you'll go bankrupt. You're a little strange one, aren't you? If not tangerines, what do you grow? You'll find out soon enough if you marry me. Three Months Later Father? What is it exactly that you do? I'm glad you asked. Recently it's been the Youth United Nations project. The Youth United Nations is dedicated to erasing war from the face of the Earth. No single nation, nor the United Nations, can accomplish that alone. We'll need every single person on Earth to bring that about. Wiping out war can only be achieved by the young. The next generation, the young generation, future generations. They're the same thing. Our youth will create the future. Americans think they're the best. The Chinese think the Chinese are the best. The French say it's the French. The English, they think they're the best. The Koreans think they're the best. In Japan, we think we're the best. Now you're raving. Each nation must abandon all concepts of superiority. A Youth United Nations is the only answer. Why can't we achieve that? The essence of humanity, the source, is the natural foods we grow and eat. You mean like the salt you make? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Natural salt is harvested from the oceans. The ocean is a larder for all mankind on this planet. The motion of all things in the universe has an effect on our bodies. Actually, I have something I want to show you. Where'd I put that book? Even more bills this month. Has Dad been spending up big again? Not much we can do. He's never once explained it to me. Why does he need to create a new cherry? Just let him do what he wants. We haven't even gone on a honeymoon, paying all these bills. You're the eldest son. Please just take care of it. Just do it? That's crazy. We can't keep this up. See? That's exactly what the author is saying. In a world full of cherry blossoms, happiness and peace are sure to prevail. Imagine if they were all your cherry blossoms! But we may not be able to do it. But there is a way to stamp out war... We can deploy all the world's warplanes to scatter cherry seeds all over the planet. Father, would you like tea? Father? Excuse me. I'm coming up. Father? What are you doing? Oh this? I'm experimenting with a hair-growth supplement. How do minerals from the earth affect hair growth? It's a natural Law of the Universe... Keiko. We have work to do. Mankind must learn to... If you'll excuse me, Father. Humans and minerals are all part of Nature's quantum aggregate. And while we live on and inhabit this planet... Red carnations - bid please! All we get is more bills. Since you got married you've been complaining a lot more. Money. It's all about the money. Aren't the maple cuttings ready? It's Dad's passion that keeps us broke. And what's that? Cherry blossoms. But cherry are everywhere. He's determined to develop a new strain. How? Some form of grafting? But that'll take years to perfect. Don't I know it! He's been at it since I was a little kid. There's no money in flowering cherries. Can't even use the wood for building. Exactly. That's what makes it so hard on me. Your dad is a strange one, alright. I wish there was some way to make some quick, easy money. Haruki. What in the hell are those tiny pine trees? You've never seen those? Those are bonsai. Bonsai? They're all over the place. I heard rich city folk pay millions of yen for one tree. Millions? I've got a great idea, Dad. Look at this! Raising bonsai? They sell for millions down in Tokyo and Osaka. The timing is perfect. We could develop the product here in Ehime! Alright son. But to get it right, we need a bonsai expert. There's a bonsai master in Tokyo I read about. Hold on a second. Dad fell for it. Fell for what? While he's obsessing over bonsai trees, he'll forget about cherry trees. And if the bonsai make us big money, that's killing two birds with one stone. I'm so smart. But will it work? Keiko, here are some more bills. We just paid bills. Those were for Dad's research. These are for the nursery business. Father and I are getting old. We need you to help support us. Then you should convince him to make some money. He's on an important mission. He can't be distracted by money. What mission? What's the big deal about a new strain of cherry blossom? Stop it. Leave the accounting to me. No, he needs to be told. Just because I stand to inherit, doesn't mean I have to pay for everything now. That's enough! You just don't get it, do you? The world needs someone like your father. He can't be distracted by having to earn a living. Here, look. That bonsai expert. Mr. Mishima, from Tokyo. Get in touch with him Keiko. Master! How noble of you to come all this way. I'm Masaaki Takaoka. And I am Kinmatsu Mishima. Bonsai master. Yes, I thought as much. Of course you did. We appreciate the invitation. This way, please. No, that's wrong! Allow me. More sake. I apologize for the wait. Make sure you lower your hips. Thank you so much! Have a safe trip home. Thank heavens. At last. What now? Maybe they forgot something? Please don't open it until we're back in Tokyo. Take care. What is it? - He said to wait. - Open it. Maybe a thank-you letter for all the food they ate? All they did was eat. It's an invoice. For 900,000 yen. 900,000 yen?! Those were some expensive lessons... What are we going to do? You're in charge of accounting, I guess. Me? Yes, you. Here they are, Mr. Saeki. They'd look good in your office. This one? No, one of his apprentices did that one. The Maestro himself made this little beauty. This one? Yes, you can see the attention to detail. How much? You can have it for 2 million yen. Who'd pay 2 million for this? Any serious bonsai collector would. If it won a prize in competition in Tokyo, perhaps. But here, in your barn, it's not worth much at all. I guess not. Seido, I'm leaving you with the rest. How come? I'm busy. Got things to do. I'm damn busy, too! This is a nice specimen. 10,000 yen. ($100) How about we make it 1,000 yen? I said 10,000! Don't want it. Okay, you can have it for 1,000! Prime Minister Miki Introduces New Cabinet I would like to send a telegram. Address it to the Prime Minister's Residence. Well, first off, congratulations on being elected Prime Minister. No, don't include that first "well." What I'm trying to say is... We're all counting on the Prime Minister to help bring about world peace, he could do that by forming a new world government. And if he could bring this message to the United Nations. Yes, the United Nations. Hasn't changed a bit. Anyone home? Taichi! It's been far too long. Thank you for coming all this way. Sorry for not coming sooner. And I'm so pleased you've brought Shizuka. My gosh, it's been so long! A little something tor you. Thank you. Mother, look. Thank you so much. Where is he? I see nothing's changed. One Year Ago One Year Ago Mr. Takaoka, One Year Ago One Year Ago I'd like to introduce my wife, Shizuka. One Year Ago Nice to meet you. One Year Ago I'm Shizuka. Nice to meet you. I'm Shizuka. Congratulations to you both. I'm sure you know this. But Taichi was born and raised in this town. He's written extensively on our cherry trees. He even calls my husband "Dad." He's always talking about you. Are you a newspaper reporter, too? No, I'm in advertising. Listen to me, Taichi. Now that you're based in Tokyo, I'm sure you can understand. Japan's politicians need to put in more effort in making people content. And that's by bringing about world peace. But I write book reviews. Doesn't matter. If we are ever to make all of mankind happy... We must stringently observe the Laws of the Universe. That is basically what I dream about. That's all for tonight. I hope you two find happiness together, and contribute to a peaceful would. He kept talking for 6 hours straight. He's really something, isn't he? You kept pulling faces. No, I wasn't! She showed her true self. I was flabbergasted, I didn't know what to do. Dad lives in a world of his own. It's almost like he's an alien from outer space. He is from outer space. You say that with such a straight face. And is he still developing his hybrid cherry? Since I was a kid. He'd been at it for 10 years when I first wrote about it. It hasn't been easy on us. I get the idea, but it just costs too much. We'll soon have to sell our orchards, just to make ends meet. That's the truth. All he ever thinks of are his grand plans. Good day to you. Hello there, Taichi. What's that? Who knows? Guess it's some form of organic vegetable extract he makes. Listen to me, Taichi. Our government isn't doing much for world peace, are they? Can you relay a message to them? I would, but the government is like a giant black hole. In cosmic terms, a black hole... Earth is part of the solar system, the galactic system. We need to devote our entire resources... And plant cherry trees all over the Earth. How long have we been planting cherry trees? Over 20 years. Fully 20 years? In cosmic terms, that's a blink of an eye. No hurry. They'll bloom when they're ready. Dad, you're ignoring the reality. I've nothing against space, but don't aliens need to eat too? Taichi, say something. Seido, please. No comment. Well, well. Don't say that! You just don't get how crazy you're sounding! There are enough cherry blossoms in the world! No one needs another mountaintop full of them. So you're saying it's crazy to wish for world peace? That's not what I said. I forgot, I have to call my editor. I'll call a taxi. No more cherry trees! Seido! That's enough! Your father was put on this Earth do something very special. I'll not have you insulting him. Here we go again. Your father's hybrid cherries are going to bloom one day. Excuse me. Delivery for Mr. Takaoka. Good, they've finally arrived. Carrots? Dad, what's all this? These carrots are very good for you. I had the grower send them direct. And how much did all this cost? Don't know. I ordered a thousand. A thousand? What will you do with 1,000 carrots? Take some back to Tokyo with you. The rest we can give to the neighbors. It's true, he IS from outer space. He's not your average farmer, that's for sure. What brings you home? I was just in the area. I think there's more to it than that. I was about to go get some water, want to give me a hand? That's heavy. Thank you. One more. What's this? It's Mr. Takaoka's natural sea salt he makes. He calls it Hakata Salt. You know what this looks like? It's a high-class ceramic called Tobe-ware. It's packaged as a wedding present. So you say. But it looks more like a funerary urn. It's genuine Tobe-ware. Then it's a Tobe-ware funerary urn. You think so? Since you married into that family, it's like you've come from outer space too. Here. Take it. I'll try to sell some of your salt to some people I know. But I'm sure it's not easy for you there. I'm always here if you need help. I was an accountant for years. I know how to manage money. Mom. That family may take you into outer space, but I'm still your mother. You can send an SOS down to me anytime. Thank you. Yes, Keiko? What is it? Take this. It should cover this month's bills. Did you borrow this? Don't worry about where it's from. Looks like Cherry Blossom Grandpa's cherries have bloomed again. Why does he keep trying to improve them? They're fine like that. He has his own standards for the perfect cherry blossom. Sure, they do look beautiful in bloom. He plants a new variety every year. But there's no money in cherry trees. Oh, by the way, Seido. What now? Go to the coast and pick me up some cherry seeds. What? I'm still trimming the maple. They're due for delivery. You can do that tomorrow. Dad, will you please get a grip? What now? What's got into you? I can't take this anymore! Seido. Let's take a walk. Where? The school I taught at before the War. I live so close, but it's been so long. 1940 (Showa 15) 1940 (Showa 15) No running! Kondo, come here. No running! Kondo, come here. You too, Fujita. You're senior students. You should be setting an example. We were running for a reason, sir. Then tell me. We respect you too much to be late for your class. Idiots! Very sorry, sir! You think flattery works on me? Alright. You won that one. Around then rice begun to be rationed. But we still believed Japan would win. And we all expected a bright shining future for the Japanese Empire. As I said, these pine roots yield a resin which can be used as fuel. Imperial Navy aircraft are short of fuel. There is a call for a general mobilization of the entire nation. So dig deep, boys! Look what I found! Look at this. Well done, young Kondo. How many kilometers you think a Zero Fighter can fly on this? Zero fighters are the best in the world. They'll be fine without your fuel. Why didn't you go to war, sir? I failed the medical exam. Spinal TB. Didn't you know? Spinal TB? Yes, vertebral tuberculosis. Inflammation of the spine. Really, sir? I bet you're disappointed you can't fight in this War. Let's take a break! As of tomorrow, you are all off to battle. There's nothing I can do for you. But promise me one thing. You will survive and return! But sir... Japan is the land of the gods. I'm saying we won't be defeated. Fulfill your duty. And come home. And let's all meet again, under this cherry tree. Right! Let's take a photograph. If I'd known, I would've gotten a haircut. Your bald head always looks the same anyway. Your necktie, sir. Yes, that looks good. Thank you. Here we go. 1-2-3. Your last day, Mr. Takaoka? We appreciate all your efforts. Our school is being nationalized. The War situation is worsening. We must raise children fit for the empire's needs. Excuse me. July 26, 1945 (Showa 20) Seido! Wake up! The shelter. Hurry! Don't worry. Get inside. Where is everybody? Start digging! We've got no tools. We'll have to dig by hand. There may be some people still inside. Stop! Who gave you permission to be here? "Permission"? No one is allowed on the Governor's property. You need permission. Are you insane? Can you not see what's happened here? Japanese Emperor's Address to the Nation Japanese Emperor's Address to the Nation To Our good and loyal subjects. To Our good and loyal subjects. August 15, 1945 Japan surrenders To Our good and loyal subjects. August 15, 1945 Japan surrenders August 15, 1945 Japan surrenders After pondering deeply the general trends of the world, After pondering deeply the general trends of the world, And the actual conditions of Our empire today, We have decided to effect a settlement of the present situation. We have ordered this to be communicated to the United States. To strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations. As well as the security and well being of Our subjects... Mr. Takaoka. Kondo! Take your hat off in my presence. I'm sorry sir... I'm ashamed that I lived to return home. Fool! There's nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing! Strange, isn't it, sir ? Even my blind eye still sheds tears. Fujita died in the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines. I see. Yoshii died in Hunan Province, China. I see. It's my fault, I told them we'd win the War and we'd all reunite under the cherry tree. Sir, don't. You know what I told them? "Japan is the land of the gods and can never be defeated." I urged them to fight. I encouraged them to go. But deep in my heart, I knew the War was a mistake. I was a teacher. They all blindly believed and I sent them off to war. How could I? How could I have been so foolish? I made a promise to them. That we'd all meet again under this cherry tree. And that's my calling. It's my duty to plant cherry trees, with my very own hands. Some boys died in the frigid lands of Siberia. Some died in the steaming jungles of Southeast Asia. But today's cherries can't grow in those places. I need a hybrid cherry that will grow anywhere, in any climate. It's my duty to create that new type of cherry tree. So that one day my students and I can meet again. Under the blossoms. Illness saved me from having to go to war. But I sent them to their deaths. While I live on! It's too much! I must do something. So therefore... I must do something to console those I sent to their deaths. Why did you never tell me this before? Because it's my burden. But listen, Seido. My duty is clear. I must create a new, hybrid cherry. So please... I need your help. Let me do this. Let me create this new hybrid cherry blossom. Let me do it. Please. By the way. Listen, Dad. What exactly do you need help with? What are you talking about? The only thing you ever talk about. Your cherry blossoms. Thanks for breakfast. Just a moment, please. He's asking for "Young Taichi." Is that you? Me? That's what he said. Hello, Kondo speaking. Young Taichi? Mr. Takaoka? What is it? I'm doing some research in Shizuoka. We've been talking to a master geneticist. Seido and I both agree. Is Seido there with you? May I talk to him? There are 100 varieties of natural crossbred cherry trees. Identifying the male and female lines is very difficult. That's what the geneticist told us. Please put Seido on. So we've come up with a new plan. Like I said, I write book reviews. And I'm very busy. I want to cross the Taiwan cherry with the Amagi-Yoshino variety. So the Taiwanese cherry and Japanese strain are going to become like a married couple! Seido! Get him off the phone! Shut him up now! The Taiwan cherry blooms in January. The Amagi-Yoshino in April. To spur world peace, our cherry needs to be in bloom for a long time. The Taiwan strain has a vivid color. The Amagi-Yoshino has a large blossom. Breed from that mix. Yes, and I think it could work. Keiko, I'm confused. Which one is which? The Taiwan cherry is male, the Japanese variety is female. The mother? But creating a whole new species is in the hands of the gods. It's all too hard for me. My husband comes from an unknown world. That's right, he's from outer space. The Great Law of the Universe states... Here he goes again! Saigon Falls to Vietcong Lockheed Bribes Japanese Lawmakers Chairman Mao Dies Come look, Seido. What is it? They're sprouting! Jimmy Carter Sworn In Is this the American Embassy? I'd like to speak to Mr. Jimmy. No, Jimmy Carter. No, we have not met before. But I want to congratulate him, and ask him to do his best to bring about world peace. This fine new Hakata Salt plant is the result of all your efforts. Congratulations. Hakata Salt is indeed a business. But it is not our intention to chase after profits. Ms. Sugamoto here is dedicated to producing salt naturally. And that is the very reason she started this company. The very core of the firm. My position as CEO is purely symbolic. You all know I'm a very poor businessman. Salt first formed on Earth 4 billion years ago. We've had mixed results. So we'll need to choose carefully. I like this one. But isn't it too garish in color for Japan? Yes, but foreigners prefer bolder colors. Remember, this is for world peace. Not just for Japan. Japan & China Sign Treaty Khomeini Takes Over Iran Margaret Thatcher New Prime Minister Coup d'etat in Korea Soviets Invade Afghanistan Look Dad! No good. We have to start over. No Dad, it's working. No it's not. Dad, wait. I've got a good idea. What? Let's get Taichi's opinion. Why him'? The man is a journalist. So what? Why him'? Cherries require the right blend of soil and water. These are essential. Yes, of course. Can you get me a cigarette? I thought you quit? I need one for this. They're over there. Any new breed needs to be officially recognized by the Ministry. Yes, but I write book reviews. By the way, I read the Ohira Cabinet has been defeated. You take it. We must all observe the Laws of the Universe. Please. Which one do you like, Mama? I bet that one would look good in the bar. This one? How much? 10,000 yen, sir. This one? That one is 1,000 yen. Mama. She said this is their best seller. I like it. Looks trendy. Really? Thank you so much. She just opened a new bar around here. 1,000 yen? Keep the change. Thank you very much. Dump him, he's a cheapskate! Spring, 1981 (Showa 56) These pictures are going to look amazing. Aren't they beautiful? Now you, Keiko. Say cheese. You know, he's actually done it! Who? The alien? But you're not finished. You'll need to register it as a new strain. Then you can actually sell them. Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries. Then the investment pays off. The registration process isn't cheap. How much? I have no idea. Anything wrong, sir? This is... A new strain of cherry tree? Yes, sir. It's very rare. No one has ever registered a new strain before. "YOKO"? ("Light of the Sun") It's a beautiful name. Yoko Cherry Officially Registered Today we're reporting from Kawauchi. The site of Japan's first ever new variety of cherry tree. The cherry is called Yoko. Let's meet the man who developed this new strain. Mr. Takaoka! Let's plant cherry trees around the world! Dad, please... Let's plant cherry trees around the world! Let's plant cherry trees around the world! He really is something. We can finally start making some money back. I'm afraid it's not much. What is it? The money you loaned me. Don't want it. You'll need it soon enough. Why? You think Mr. Takaoka did all this for money? Well, I'm not really sure. Don't be stupid! To him, it's all about world peace. That's what the newspaper said. I have no time to read newspapers. I'm always so busy. Hello there. The blossoms look beautiful. I'm actually thinking of starting a "YOKO Cafe." I think it'll do good. I bet it will. Put this away. Enjoy your meal. Your generation doesn't know war. You have no idea that some things are just more important than money. Sorry. But I'm still hopeful. Mr. Takaoka's new cherry blossoms just may teach you that. Were these cherries grown somewhere else? Yeah, I guess he contracted out to a local farmer. Seido was complaining about it. Is that right? No, not like that. These are not just saplings. They're gifts from the heart! Sorry. Dad, is that true? Keiko said you're not selling them. Didn't I explain it to you? I developed these for the spirits of my students and for world peace. Yes, but still! I want these planted all over Japan. All over the world. Dad, wait a minute. You're saying you're going to be giving them to the whole world for free? Father, look! The mayor sent us some boar meat to thank us for sending him YOKOs. There's enough for all. Let's have it stewed tonight. Sounds great! See? Giving away the cherries brings good fortune. That's right! You gotta be kidding me. How much has he spent? One million yen this year. Not again! He spent that much last year. Sending them overseas costs money. He goes from bad to worse. He really does. I know it's about dead pupils and world peace. But you think they could at least pay the postage. It's not as if we're millionaires. The newspapers are all over Dad. Calling him the Cherry Blossom Grandpa. Well, at least he's happy. That's because he doesn't have to pay the bills. So we'd be better off without the cherries? That's not what I said. The money will work itself out in the end. Yes, hello? Mr. Takaoka. Yes. Don't take any more orders from your father? The trees he pays you for, he gives them away. I saw that in the newspaper. Very noble. It may look noble in the papers, but we're facing reality here. If this keeps up, we'll go bankrupt. We're not going to be able to pay you what we owe. Whatever you say. But please call if anything comes up. My customers love the Yoko cherry. This is too much. That's it! Hot Spring Resort Hot springs? You've spent so much time and energy on the cherries, you need a break. Kyushu has some great resorts. And I'm paying for it all. For you too, mom. An all expenses paid holiday? You'll both enjoy yourselves. You serious?! Listen Seido! You want me to retire? Or you actually want me dead? Not at all. No! I know what you're thinking, but it won't work. Okay. Just do whatever you want. You lost. Stick up for me, Mom. See Seido? YOKO puts smiles on everybody's faces. A good thing - I guess. Look at this, Seido. Is that my allowance? Didn't you cancel the outside contractor? Yes, last year. Why? It's an invoice from another farmer. 800,000 yen? Dad! What does this mean? You fired my grower so I got a new one. Seriously? I am accumulating virtues. You two will reap the rewards. What on Earth goes through his head? World peace? Accumulating virtues? No one even notices. My dear. March 16, 1993 (Heisei 5) First time Dad hasn't spoken a word all day. He misses her, obviously. When all's said and done, she was his biggest supporter. Excuse me. Anyone home? Yes? Be right there. Is this the home of Masaaki Takaoka? Yes. How can I help you? My business card. A detective? Assistant Inspector Satake. My subordinate. Officer Ito. What exactly is the Public Safety Division? Mainly political crimes. We monitor and gather intelligence. Chasing radicals? Public Safety. Here's some tea. Don't mind us. We're public servants. Where is your father now? He had something to take care of at City Hall. Is he in trouble? He has come to our attention. You're not aware of any laws he's broken? I can't think of anything. He makes salt, grows bonsai and hybrid cherry trees. I'm afraid our investigation must remain confidential. But the Imperial Household Agency has asked for a background check. The Palace? You know about something, Keiko? Yes, your father... Yes, a telegram to the Emperor. You don't deliver to the Palace? Then the Imperial Household Agency please. The courtiers can pass it on to him. I'll dictate it now. War produces both victors and victims. For mankind, this is a hideous outcome. As we know, Japan lost the War. Creating millions of victims in foreign countries. So if the Emperor could go to the UN and make a sincere appeal. For world peace. He sent the Emperor a telegram? Did the Emperor get it? Of course not. But it did reach his staff. And they asked us to investigate your father. What is he like? From a son's perspective? What's he like? He never stops talking. We all say he's an alien from outer space. You find this funny? No, sorry. Essentially, this is just a formality. But many in the Imperial Agency were surprised. No subject has ever sent a telegram to His Majesty before. If he spoke English, he'd be calling the White House. I bet he would! We must insist that this ceases now. Yes, sorry. Thank you. Father, it's for you! It says "medals." What's this about? Good, the medals have arrived. What medals? They're so pretty. Who are they from? A manufacturer made them to my design. I plan to give them away. When the Yoko cherry is in bloom, all around the world, I'll hand these out to those who helped me. Looks good. Father. What would you like for dinner? I'm not really hungry. Do you feel ill? I can't seem to stand up. That's expected it your age. Here. No, I can do it. Father? One for you. Thank you. Answer that? Taichi Office. Yes, one moment. The Takaoka family, from Ehime. If it's the old man, just say I stepped out. It's a woman, sir. Is he conscious of his surroundings? I can't say definitively. But he is reacting to your voices. Dad. Dad. Taichi and Shizuka are on their way from Tokyo. How long will he last? He's very old. Tonight will be crucial. Fortunately, he is in no pain or discomfort. They're here. Taichi's arrived. Glad you made it. How is he? Still hanging in there. Oh, Taichi. Are you awake? Mr. Takaoka? Please be gentle with him. Father! Dad! He hears you Taichi. Tell him goodbye. Seido, please. September 10th. At precisely 11:15 a.m. I'm afraid he has passed. Dad... Please wait outside while we prepare the body. September 10, 2001 (Heisei 13) He looks so peaceful. He died the day he was put in the hospital. At least he didn't suffer. You're his son? Yes. My name is Kosaka. I had a chance to speak to your father before he passed. He asked me to plant cherry trees in Lithuania. Lithuania? Lithuania had its own Schindler, a Japanese diplomat. You know the story? No, I'm ashamed to say. His name was Chiune Sugihara. Mr. Sugihara was based in Kaunas, Lithuania. I must admit, I didn't know anything about him at first. Sugihara issued visas to 6,000 Jews fleeing from the Nazis. Despite the Japanese government forbidding him to do so. So, Mr. Kosaka. Mr. Chiune Sugihara, you say? This man is a hero! If only I could go to Lithuania. Do you think you could plant Yoko cherries there? In his honor? Yoko Cherries? Yes, of course. To further world peace. The Yoko Cherry is a symbol of world peace. He never mentioned it. You were too busy worrying about money all the time. Maybe so, but still... Unfortunately, he never had the chance to visit Lithuania. But we can keep his dream alive. We're assembling volunteers that are offering to plant Yoko Cherries all over the world. As his son, I figured you'd know a lot more about him than you do. Is that appropriate to say to someone at a wake? Forgive me. Not at all. But please let me say one thing. His family, the people of Ehime... No, the entire nation of Japan... should be proud of your father. Now if you'll excuse me. I was wondering where you were. What is it? Your father left another surprise. His bankbook. I was tidying up your father's desk. The company has managed to save funds. That's a lot of money. It's exactly enough to pay for his own funeral. You're right. He really was something. I'm accumulating virtues. You two will reap the rewards. I feel a great sense of loss. What do you mean? He never stopped talking. Sometimes I pretended to listen but I'd put the phone down. I can imagine. One time, I completely fell asleep. Hours later, I woke up. And he was on the other end, still talking. For six hours solid! You had to admire such dedication. I only wish I'd listened more. He wanted to get rid of all war and really bring about world peace. Naturally, everyone wants that. But he's the only one who could talk about it for 6 straight hours. Listen, Taichi. It was more than 6 hours. From the end of the war up till yesterday. He spent 56 years talking about world peace. That's all he ever talked about. Have some water. Thank you. What's this? Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center. According to a witness who saw the second plane crash... It appeared that the plane intentionally crashed into the tower. Oh no. War breaks out the day after he dies? Come on, Seido. I can't do it. You have to. You're like family. You do it. I can't. I'd like to say a few words on behalf of the family. Masaaki Takaoka constantly reminded the world of the need for peace. And for all of us to recognize our humanity. His family, here today. And those of us close to the family. With great respect for his beliefs, we called him an alien from outer space. To us, he is not dead. He has merely returned to the Universe, where he belongs. Where I'm sure his passion still burns brightly. He was a man who stuck to his principles. Few others have lived life as he did. Today is not a day to shed tears. Far better we applaud him and all of his achievements. So many books and papers. Can I open this box? Sure. Wonder what's in it. Letters. "Hope you are well, Mr. Takaoka." "The Yoko Cherry you sent 10 years ago is now in full bloom." What's this one? It's written in English. Let me see. I can't read it. Wait, just a minute. Isn't this from the Vatican? This is from Korea. It's from the Korean president! These are letters of appreciation from all over Japan... No, from all over the world. You didn't know? From the Pope himself! That's a big deal!
