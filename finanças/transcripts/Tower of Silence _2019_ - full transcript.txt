Before my time, this was once a great library. It held books from all kingdoms on language, history, and magic. It has been long abandoned. But there should still be a book or two worth salvaging. Look for anything still intact. The rest of the patrol will be returning any minute. Would you help us with the supplies? Yes, Lieutenant. Come, friends. In Hempstead, they are accustomed to wheat. Once that is done, take the company and head west. Yes sir. We'll catch up within the hour. Uncle! Ah. Good to see you, nephew. Glad to see you are well. What news from patrol? Walk with me. We encountered many of the enemy, much more than we expected. But our soldiers were able to stand their ground. We will return to Bevervick once we resupply. Let me come with you. You know that I can help you in the field. No, it's too soon, Denzikel. Please, uncle, I'm sorry for the way that I acted. You disobeyed a direct order! You could have been killed walking blind into an enemy camp like that. I survived. Yes, you survived by fate's favor, not by your own luck. Do not attempt this again. Your rashness is not the only reason you must stay at the monastery. I am more than fit for duty and my talents are being wasted. Truly? When did you last sleep? I keep going back to that night. If only I'd been there sooner right now she'd still be alive! You did everything. Everything in your power. Is it always this... Painful? Yes. Yes it is. Stay here and rest. When you've recovered, then come join me in Bevervick. I will, I promise. Now, there is still much more that needs to be done. Church guard must return to Bevervick by sunset. If these attacks continue, our forces there cannot last. What do you know about this Captain Orson? Or he is a good man who can help us. How do you know him? Well his nephew stayed with my family years ago. What reason does he have to help us? We trespassed into the wastelands and the King's laws forbid... Orson and Kae share common enemies. He will not turn down a chance to defeat them. The Blackguard are not the only enemy we have to worry about. There are many other dangers in the forest. You have no need to worry, Arcadia. We're perfectly safe. Come. Groth. Time has not been kind to you. You have fallen far, Groth. Why did you spare my life? Have you come to mock me? Killing you would be merciful. Oh no, old friend, I have plans for you. You will join us. I will not be turned. I would rather die than forsake the light. Pain is a great teacher. When you are more familiar with it you will become receptive to our ways. If you resist, this false world you cling to will burn. Then what will you have to fight for? You cannot win. Who will stop us? There are still many who will fight you and your serpents. All of your strength will be useless. You are blind, sorcerer. I am not alone, no. Marwoleath of the necromancer has joined me. There is some magic in the world that must be left alone. Even you would not seek his help! As I speak, Marwoleath is in pursuit of your students. He will find them and kill everyone who stands in his path. You expect me to believe such lies? I'll leave you with the knowledge that their deaths are on your hands. You horrid vagabond! What's troubling you, my child? I see my past before me. I cannot sleep, my days are waking dreams. I don't know what to do. Your suffering is brought on by fear. Fear? I am not afraid, Zahara. I do not fear the enemy, nor death itself. You have a great fear of death. You cannot bear to lose those around you. I know death is not the end. But as many times that I tell myself this I still miss her. I hate myself for feeling so weak. Denzikel, you are young still. In time, you will learn more about this world. One day, you will be a great paladin. Why was I chosen? I am not worthy of the title. Surely there are others. The fates chose you. This is as it must be. If you were not worthy, you would not have been chosen. Denzikel. You should be getting a rest. Captain told me not to let you take watch. I thought the night air might help. Hope you don't mind the company. Is something the matter, my friend? We're leaving for Bevervick in the morning. You're more than welcome to stay. The soldiers can handle themselves. I'm more comfortable at the front. I'm at my best when performing soldier's duties. Your skills and loyalty have never been in question. Thank you for your confidence. But it is clear you need rest. There's no shame in staying away from battle. You should take the time you need to recover. I do not think that time will heal me. Tomorrow I'll leave to rejoin my uncle. Denzikel, we were given orders not to let you leave the monastery. If you attempt to leave, we ought to stop you. Ah, well. Well then, you leave me no choice. I'll just have to find a way to sneak past you. I thought as much. Be safe, friend. You as well. Paladins are hard to come by these days. So are friends. Thank you, Mark. I shall attempt to get some rest before the morning. How is he? He's on the mend. He should be himself in a few days time. He's leaving, isn't he? Just as Orson said he would. Yes. And we are agreed that it's best to let him go. He'll stand a better chance with Denzikel than without him. What was that? What is it? There's something in the forest. Could be a shadow, I'm not sure yet. We're under attack. We're under attack! Denzikel, wake the others! We're under attack! To arms, we're under attack! Finn. It seems my time here will not be wasted after all. Swords will be of no use here. I sense something different in you. It has been a long time since I've had the pleasure of killing a holy knight. This persistence is useless. I have a strength far beyond any of you. Denzikel! Finn! Why do you go to him? You cannot save him, you are all doomed to die. Submit to me. You have lost. Face me! What are you waiting for? You. You will watch them die. You have not earned this death you seek. I will never stop fighting you! Mark! Mark, Mark! Finn's dead. He killed him. It's okay, you can still make it. You can survive. Stay with me, stay with me, Mark! Denzikel. My dear. Please don't leave me. I'm not leaving you. - Please help me. - I'm not leaving you! Look for survivors. Rahim, this one's still alive. It cannot be. This is the Captain's nephew. Quick, we must get him to shelter, come. I will make my way to the buildings. Perhaps there will be some supplies that will avail themselves. Stay with me. Move slowly, you need time to mend. You've healed yourself. No, Mark! He's dead. Did anyone else make it? We found no one else alive. I should have been more careful. It is not your fault. Denzikel, the fates smile on you, friend. I need a moment to catch my breath. You probably have no memory of me. I am Rahim. This is Arcadia. When we were boys, you took shelter in my family's house. We were friends for some time. Rahim, I remember you. It's been many years since I've seen your face. You have survived a vicious attack, and by what miracle I do not know. I owe you both a debt for saving my life but I do not earn your praise. Tell me, what brought you here? Well we needed to find your uncle but it seems that we are too late. My uncle left at sunset with most of our troops. He was not here for this massacre. He is alive? Then there is hope for us to find him. There is, but why do you need to find him? Our headmaster is being held prisoner. The enemy is marching here. Your headmaster was lucky to be spared. But we do not know how much longer they will keep her alive. The enemy has a new leader and it is not like them to travel in such great numbers. There was a necromancer. He led the fallen here and killed my friends. This is the same foe. I know the roads that can take us to rejoin my uncle without the enemy detecting us. We can gather the Church's forces and we march up on the fallen. There is no guarantee that we will get to the Captain in time. Yes, but we stand a better chance rescuing Kae with Captain Orson alongside us. My uncle could be no more than a day ahead of us. I will lead you to him and we will recover your teacher. But first, I ask you to help me with one task. Why do you haunt me? If you are starting to talk to the trees, it might be time to get some rest. I will keep them company, you should sleep. It's fine, I wasn't planning on sleeping. Instead of talking to trees, you could talk to me. I hope I can give better conversation. Commander. We have not found any survivors. Not even any bodies. How is this? Neither the fallen or their victims. What was taken? Livestock, gold? Everything has been burnt. We think the fallen set fire to Bevervick and slaughtered the villagers as they fled. There are no bodies, but a good deal of blood. The fallen have carried off the corpses. Commander? The townspeople were slaughtered. Their bodies desecrated and carried away. Why would the enemy do this? I do not know. But I assure you, Lieutenant, I will end this. Let us regroup. Marwoleath. The sorcerer is proving resistant to our methods. It will be simpler to kill her. She is too useful to be thrown away. You must learn patience, Groth. She will become one of us. The task at hand is more important. We must not waste our time on her. Leave the sorceress to me. I will break her. You must lead the Blackguard into the Iron Wood forest. There's an old cemetery there that will be useful to us. There are still church soldiers on patrol. We must not leave this tower open to attack. We have nothing to fear from a rabble of men. They cannot stop us. We will continue as planned. Do not measure your strength on what you have yet to possess. We must be prepared for an attack. I'll trust you will not forget whom you serve. I have survived by never underestimating my enemy. I recommend caution. Go into the Iron Woods and find the burial grounds. Take whatever forces you must and bring me the remains. Make sure nothing stops you. Do you understand? As you wish. Denzikel, is that the fastest way across the river? It's the only way. No other bridge crosses the river until Rensolere, 30 leagues north. There are no shortcuts here, friend unless you feel like a swim. The bridge leaves us completely exposed. We'll have to wait for the cover of night to cross. We'll have to risk a daytime crossing. We need to be cautious. Every moment we stop, my uncle gets further away. We cannot afford to stop. Exposing ourselves leaves us open to an ambush! Rahim, will you please tell her that time is... Shh! And yelling gave us away! What are you doing? We don't know how many are out there. There is nothing to fear. Rahim. When they approach, I need you to, Wait for my signal. He is on his way. Is he being followed? Not anymore. Good. Your friend has a habit of getting into trouble. Yes, well he has a way of getting out of trouble too. He is slowing us down. Are you sure he is of any help to us? Denzikel has suffered terribly and we must have patience. It is not like you to ask so much of others. My mind is fixed on one purpose. Well I assure you, if there is a call for battle, he'll be one of the first you want by your side. My worry is that he is far too eager to fight. - That is not our way. - Friends. Please don't make a habit out of needing to be rescued. Arcadia. Rescued? I could easily handle one Blackguard. One Blackguard? What about the 12 on his heels? I thought you were behind me. We were. But it is our belief that we try to avoid bloodshed until it is necessary. I was unaware you were in possession of such powers. I have a right to my secrets. Everyone does. If you could hide us from the Blackguard, we can cross the bridge unseen. Every time I hide you, I'm completely vulnerable. Rahim has to guard me. There are limits to my magic. Everything comes with a cost. When we return for Kae, I can help us. But until then, we need to stay hidden. Wait. I hear something in the distance. They're heading toward us. Take cover! There's only one. I can take him. Stay put. Resist the urge to fight. That's not my way. Denzikel! Who is he? His name is Groth. He took Kae from us. He's not one of the fallen. No. He communes with something much darker. You put all of our lives in danger. If the chance comes up again, do not fight him! He should be avoided at all costs. I suggest we make some headway. Let us not assume we will go undetected. I'll keep watch. Trust me, friend. We are safe as in any castle. She is remarkable. I've never seen anyone so gifted with magic. Arcadia, she is naturally gifted. Beyond that, we had a great teacher in Kae. And what of you? For all your talk of studying together I've not seen you cast a single spell. Is there something you're not telling me? It is my own fault. I was overconfident with my abilities and threw caution to the wind. Rahim. What happened? This is the mark of arrogance. I chased after spells that even masters use with precaution. I'm lucky to be alive. How long will it take to heal? This is as healed as I will ever see it. Well let me cast holy water. It will do nothing. The part of me that once communed with nature itself is lost. I must bear this as a reminder of caution to others. When this is all over, I will find a way to help you. There are many things in this world which we do not yet understand. And there may yet be something that can aid you. Thank you, friend. I do not doubt your word. Does Arcadia know? She was one of the first to try and help. But don't worry about me, I don't need protection. I don't want you worsening your condition. I will not let this stop me from living. I want to live a full life with those who see me for what I am and not for the foolish mistakes I've made. Are you well, commander? We're nearing the Wastelands, Lieutenant. Yes sir. This is an alternate route that affords us speed. The King has ordered us to stay out of the Wastelands unless we provoke the fallen to attack. They have already begun the attack. Bevervick is a warning of what is to come. We all swore an oath to the crown, Lieutenant. Here do I give my life to the crown and all she protects. The lands of the crown, its citizens, the Royal Protector, yet I hear no mention of the King himself. Are you being flippant, Lieutenant? I am merely concerned for the well-being of the crown. I will not foolishly risk the lives of my brothers in arms. Sir, what are you keeping from me? It's not the first time I entered the Wastelands nor the first time I risked violating the Royal Charter. During our last campaign, countless of our own were captured by the fallen. This was before we knew anything about our enemy. They were but another foreign tribe. I was to take a company of soldiers in an attempt to rescue them. Simply sneak in and save them. I was ordered to stand down. I could not leave our people to die a cruel death at a foreign land so when my company arrived, we attacked. That was when we learned the fallen are not born but returned. Men and women, tortured until they're nothing but husks of their former selves. Our assailants, once our friends. I would look into his eyes and I, I see him as he once was. I could still hear his voice which once resonated with laughter and truth. They all echoed with death and despair. None of my soldiers was prepared. I... I was not prepared. We now know the enemy we face. You are not leading these soldiers astray. We know what we face, we stay our path. If this route leads us into the Wastelands, the fallen are sure to take notice. Should we survive, the King will be displeased. Every officer here will be in shackles. These soldiers are noble in their conduct and calling. Every mind is set on a just and moral service. Once again you lift the fog. Lior, I am honored to share a field of battle with you. We've lost too much time. Which way is the Captain's path? This way will lead us to Bevervick. The other way strikes the borders of the Wasteland. The forest will afford us cover. Bevervick is but a day away. With my uncle guarding the town, the path is safe. Is that them? Get off the path. We cannot risk them finding us. Is everything in place? Yes Lord Groth. Bevervick was burnt to the ground. Nothing was left. Good. Take the bones to the tower. We need everything back before sunrise. As you wish, my Lord. Move your sorry hides, all of you! My uncle's forces have fallen. He has died a soldier's death. It is at it must be, know this. There are no words for our enemies. I must go to Rensolere. Why? We must warn them. They are the next town in the path and in the most danger. It will take three days. But I am the last protector. I owe them this. Give him distance. He is heartbroken and buries his grief behind his soldier's duties. And that is his choice. Should we stop? Please, speak to him. For all our sakes. I never thought I would see you again. I did not realize that you'd still be plaguing the world in death. Your understanding of life and death is so limited. If only you would open your eyes and see what we have seen. I will not give up my life so easily. Life is sacred. We have moved beyond this temporary stage you call life. We do not age, we do not die. We are permanent. We will inherit this earth. And from the ashes of your mortal kingdoms will rise our undying grace. You spit in the faces of the divines who gave us life. You act to destroy everything beautiful that this world has to offer. You submit to this constant cycle of death and rebirth forced upon us. Mortality is weakness. By claiming an immortal life, we can become more powerful than the divines. We can be our own masters. You are blind. You would destroy everything in this world that is worth living for! We shall see who is blind when this fragile world you fight for is laid to waste. When my glory is made true, perhaps then you can be made to understand. Keep her alive and bound. Do as you wish otherwise. Help, no! Oh no! No! Arcadia! What's the matter? I am fine, go back to sleep. That was more than a dream. I could see it in you... Sleep. At least one of us will get some sleep tonight. I did not know you were still awake. Sleep has been escaping me for some time now. You have endured more in the span of a few days than anyone deserves. I am familiar with this. If you will not sleep, may I ask you something? You may. What are you? A spellcaster can only be trained in one place and I have not yet seen you before. I do not use magic. I have seen it. When the necromancer left you dead, you healed your body from across consciousness. It cannot be willed or controlled. There is no school for it. Is it innate? Were you blessed at birth? My mother passed me her gift. She died when I was very young. I did not mean to pry. I ought to afford you some privacy. It's fine. She was the only other paladin I've ever known. When she died, Rahim's family took me in. I know better than to offer you words for your loss. The pain never truly leaves us. I've gone most of my life without my family. I can scarcely remember their faces. I do not remember their names. You carry yourself with great strength. Kae has been my teacher, my master, my guide. I owe her everything. I cling to the sliver of hope she's still alive. I do not ask you to believe me. I do. We will find her. I give you my word. Who was she? You see her as well? You called out to her when we found you lying in the field. Her spirit persists. She torments because I failed her. That is no spirit. What is it that I see? You must let her go. Forgive yourself. I do not need your pity, Arcadia. Forgive me. You know, my company bothers you so I will leave. It was my fault she is dead. Her death is on my hands. And I've tried to forgive myself but I alone bear the blame. How long has it been? It's been a fortnight since I laid her to rest. We argued. And in my anger I left her in the night. The next day a patrol recovered her body from a Blackguard ambush. It won't be much longer now. Once the final pieces are in place all we will have to do is wait. You put too much faith into a single creation. This is but the first of many. We will use it to storm the next town. I will study its effectiveness and make it more stronger with every forging. We should be turning villages into our servants, not grinding them into weapons of war. What use is an army if we have no empire to rule? I will not bet our victory on chance. There will be many left to fill our ranks. But we need an army to take us to the gates of the Capital, and I will not have your mercy weaken the kingdom of the undying. Is that understood? Good. Lieutenant, my memory grows cloudy. What was it that called you to join the church? I followed my instincts, sir. Desire to serve those around me. Hmm, you could have served your country and stayed in your homeland as one of its guards. My homeland is an island. The sea itself is our protector. The Blackguard have never set foot on our shores but I couldn't stay safe while others were attacked. You do not fear them. I'm concerned for the death and destruction they will bring. It cannot be allowed. Hmm. True. I do not know what we will face in the days ahead or how strong our foe have become. You must endure. I will never run from a fight. I'm a warrior to my last breath. Of this I trust. I pray our forces are true. If the tide turns and our strength fails us, the King must be warned of the growing threat. I would never leave your side in battle as the couriers and the men-at-arms, my place is here. Lior, I've lost too many friends over the years. You have many years ahead of you. If I am to die in that field, it'll be as it must. Your greatest deeds may yet lie ahead. You are most kind, sir. Come. Give it time, Denzikel. Though your healing may come slowly, even with great sadness, there's something to learn. Your friends will be glad to know that you survived. I cannot change my fate, nor would I. You are quick to say so. I miss my friends dearly. But to want the power to change my fate is unthinkable. Though it is natural to wish to see those we have lost but our natural emotion should not cause us guilt. I fear deep sadness that spoils into anger and thirsts for power. I'm forbidden from desiring power and the thought that I might one day be tempted makes me doubt my strength. You Denzikel, are a servant of good. I have never doubted your desire to do what is right and just. Thank you, my friend. Please, Arcadia, hear me now. Without the Blackguard hounding us, we should make Rensolere in a few days time. I hope that follow our news, there's still some respite offered us. Arcadia? What's the matter? You can stop them. Return to me. Go back to the tower. It must be done. There is the chance to stop them. The horrible weapon, not even its creator can control it. You must destroy it. Smite it with the holy magic of the divine. Fight it as you would the most wicked darkness. He can destroy this creature, bring him here. You can break his cycle and save the lives of everyone the necromancer threatens. Do not concern yourself with me. I have played my part in this. No sudden movements. Let your mind find your body again. We need to go back to the Wastelands. Kae is still alive. Ah, fates help us. Are you sure? She spoke to me. We need to save her. We can do it. I will go with you. The Blackguard have too many defenses in place and their numbers are too great. I have a plan. Brothers and sisters in arms, we have been forbidden from entering this land by order of the King. But we all took a vow to the Kingdom to protect it and its people from all evils. I ask help, but only from those willing to follow me into this wretched place. And know this. There'll be no judgment from me if you turn back. But if you do follow me, you'll be violating a direct order of the King. Today, I act as my own master and I vow to part out justice for those who cannot. I go in the name of the slaughtered. You are free to make your own decisions. Choose wisely. From this place, Kae led us to the tower undetected. I can keep us from being seen. I will lead us. How far to the end of this tunnel? Many miles. The path is not straight. It never is. Are you sure of this? By coming here, we are doing what is right. I do not doubt that. I don't wish to lead you falsely. We may well not come back from this. I will not abandon Kae. Nor I. We are bound by honor, friends. One does not need to be a soldier to understand this. We cannot stay here long. I have found her. How far from here? A few floors. Is she heavily defended? Nothing but a locked door. This is our chance. Why would she be left unguarded? I can keep us hidden. Isn't there anyone else in the hallways? Just a Blackguard patrol standing outside the tower but something has him occupied. Then we must move quickly for that could buy us but so much time. We act now. There's something not right about this. Rahim, I need your help. Why is she not waking up? She has a weak connection to her body. I will get her centered. Kae, please. Come back to me. I've done as you asked. Oh my dear. I came back for you. Rahim, oh. Oh, oh. I came back for you. I will not leave you. You must never give up hope. You are a paladin. Kae, this is Denzikel. He has been a great help along the way. It's an honor to meet you, headmaster Kae. You carry the mark of your family. You do them honor. Know that you have a talent. Headmaster, we need to leave. I could not find the Captain in time but there is still a threat in this tower. We cannot leave. I have summoned you for a task and I will see it through. We are in no position to fight. Have you not told them? Forgive me, we need to leave. Get behind me! Arcadia, get Kae out of here! Your doctrine is hopeless. You have lost a valiant effort. You don't have to die. This world is temporary and it will end. In it's place, we will build a kingdom of neverending life. We will be deathless. Which world do you choose? A poor choice. You will suffer for your weakness! Futile. They bring their own damnation. Soon they will be but a memory. No. They are flesh, they still serve us. We have yet to turn the sorceress. Take them to the pit. My creation nears its time. These fools will live to see its birth. But this one may die. No, Denzikel, wait! No! Yeah! Groth. Deal with them. Kill the heretics! No evil shall break our ranks. We protect the living! And we avenge the slaughtered! Charge! Your time has come. Prove your worth. You cannot win, Marwoleath. I already have. Do you understand yet? Do you see the kind of power we possess? We do not fear kings or gods. And we certainly do not fear you. You have lost. On your knees. What happened? Let me see him. Be relieved, he's still alive. Thank the fates. That spell took a heavy toll. But you have a great inner resilience, my dear Rahim. I could not let them kill you. Rest. Let your strength return. I'm glad you're still alive. Save your strength, my friend. There was a moment there when I thought all was lost. It is by some miracle that we've survived. I thought you were dead! Denzikel, what happened here? Why aren't you at the monastery? The monastery was destroyed. There is much to tell you. But first there is someone you must meet. I cannot thank you and your soldiers enough, Captain Orson. Without your arrival this day would have ended in tragedy. Are you hurt? I've been worse. Are there others in the tower? No, I don't believe so. But my student Rahim needs assistance. Captain Orson, good to see you again. His wounds are not life-threatening. Can you stand? Yes. Denzikel. Rahim is stronger than I believed. Perhaps you can tend to the safety of the others. I was surprised to see you here, Rahim. I'm glad you survived. Oh believe me Captain, no one is more thankful for the surprise than us. Let us tend to your wound. Yes. I'm sorry, headmaster. What do you mean? I should have found the Captain as you asked. I put everyone's lives in danger, and I should have... I could not be more proud of you, Arcadia. Is he all right? He is now. Much more than we expect. You know what that means. I cannot, truly. Are you sure you will not stay? I can send a courier in your place. I'm sure. I need to make sure they get back safely. I owe them that much. Safe journeys. When you meet the King, give him this. It will explain all that has happened here these last few days. Thank you for all you've done. What will you do now? Rebuild. With friends like you and dedicated warriors such as these, we have a solid foundation on which to build a lasting peace. Be well, my friends. Well, we have work to do.
