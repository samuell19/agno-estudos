Oh, what do you think? Isn't it wonderful? (LAUGHS) This is not a traditional memorial service. This is a celebration of life. My mother and namesake, Clementine Jones, was a force of nature. Six months after my dad died, she moved us here. She'd... she'd only ever grown herbs in a window box and... and then she bought this farm and it was rundown and ramshackle and, uh, and she moved us here to start over and, boy, did we. (SIGHS) Mom, we will... ..all miss you. To Mom! - To Aunt Clem. - To Clementine. (SHEEP BLEATS, ROOSTER CROWS) EMMY: I've missed you guys, you know. DAVID: Hmm. I will tell you that if I see a snake, I'm gonna have to get the hell out of here, though. OK. - Snake! - No! - (CHUCKLES) - Watch out! (EMMY SCREAMS) Stop it! - (MEN LAUGH) - I've had a long day.

Some of the ideas in here are just... Ahh, Clem was a wellness pioneer before that was even a thing. Herbal remedies. Animal therapies. And, uh, naked moonlight dips in a lake filled with yabbies. (LAUGHS) I had no idea how wild she was, you know? She actually swore that could cure anything. (DAVID SIGHS) - I know you hate the farm. - Oh, no, no. - I don't hate the farm. - (LAUGHS) Oh, you have always hated... - I... No, no. - ..hated... I hate parts of the farm. You know, I'm just... I'm... I'm not a farmy person, which is why I moved to New York. You know, it's not my... Hmm. Have you ever noticed everything around here is trying to actually kill me? Um... that's in your head. No, that... that is a fact. Hmm. I just hope somehow we can hold on to the place. How bad is it? Your mum took out so many loans and she hadn't paid them off. She was a genius when it came to a lot of things at Fig Tree, but when it came to finances, she's... Stubborn. Like a mule. (CHIMES PLAY ON P.A.)

You need to get your name out there again because I can't do my job if you don't do yours! (GROANS) Listen to me, Leslie. I will get you... (GROANS) ..the pages within 48 hours, OK? 48 hours. Just give me 48 hours and you will have a book. OK? I promise. Excuse me. You'd better not be drinking again on this flight. No. No drinking. I'm drinking! Book. Write it. 'Bye. I'll call you later.

I just finished the book and now I'm starving. (SIGHS) It's cold out there. LESLIE: Don't take this personally. All I got was rejection letters from the publishing houses that even bothered to reply. It's just not compelling enough in today's world. No, no. How is that possible? My guess is that it's... dated. I mean, it needs to take place now! - No. - Yes. People want a guru, someone they can... ..they can emulate in these weird times. A dead lady can't write a sequel or do a spin-off cookbook or make TikToks or go on Instagram Live. I don't want to go on Instagram or make TikToks. I don't want to be an influencer. - Yes! You... do. - I just want... A brand.

Because you know what I say about good food. (BEEP!) Good food made great... (SIGHS) ..turns any frown... CLEMENTINE AND YOUNG EMMY: ..upside down! (MOBILE BUZZES) Hello? I have London & London on the line. They want your 'Clementine' book! - And they want it bad, babes. - What? My pitch was note-perfect - they even believed me when I said we were still fielding offers. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What... what is the offer? Well, they started at 250,000. A quarter of a million dollars! Let's take it! Take it, Leslie. Are you crazy? You never take the first offer. - Let me do my thing. - No, no, no, no, no! I'm putting you on hold. - No! - Are you still there? - Still here. - So, I just talked to my client. And... she wants more money. 250 grand is very, very generous for a first-time author. LESLIE: Are you kidding me? This isn't some vampire stiletto airport trash. We're all on the same page there. Uh... What's your counter? I need a number. 2 million. (LAUGHS) OK. You're not serious. Oh! Hello? - (PHONE DROPS) - We can go to, um, 500,000. - No, no! No, no, no! Oh! Tell me what other publishing houses are interested. - Maybe we can match them. - Oh, my God. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! Not now! Listen, London & London are very... Hello? ..very serious about acquiring the rights to this book. I can go to 750,000. Uh, we are taking other offers, talking to many other publishers. Lots of money. We want... We want all the money. Look, listen, all I can pay maximum is $1 million. That is a final offer. It's take it or leave it. - A million bucks? - A million dollars?! - Who's that? - Take it. We're taking it. - Wait. So we have a deal? - BOTH: Deal! Yes! We have a deal, people! - (SCREAMS) - (SQUEALS) (LAUGHS) Whoo! We saved the farm. Ohh! - (PHONE BUZZES) - (SIGHS) (GROANS) Hmm. Hello. - (EMMY SCREAMS) - What happened? - EMMY: Deal!

(KNOCK AT DOOR) Babe... I'm... calling. You don't answer. Did you... run... here? - Yes! - What is going on, Leslie? Ellison London and her son are coming to Emu Creek Farm Springs for Christmas! What? Why? What is going on? Did I not tell you about that little line item in the contract? Before they close the deal, London & London has the right to meet you. With an invitation to Christmas in... in Australia? Two invitations to Christmas in Australia, actually. One for you and one for her son. With you, your husband and your daughter. I don't have a husband or a daughter. Or a mother. I know. So sad. Leslie! They want the full Emu Farm Springs experience just like in the book or the deal goes away. (THROWS PIZZA CRUST) Ooh, pickles! OK, I want you to look me in the eyes and listen, OK? I don't do farm. I can't cook. I can't even boil an egg. It's not so bad. You just become your mother for a few weeks. Tickle a few cows with some suits. Give them Clem's Country Christmas, save 'Little House on the Prairie' and, boom, all your dreams come true. I... (BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) It's not funny. It is kind of funny. I only have a few days to find myself a husband, a daughter and become my mother, OK? - MILES: Jump in. - (DAVID GROANS) - EMMY: I'm not that heavy! - No. (DAVID SIGHS) EMMY: That's new. Oh, yes, Miles started an online art class. When you tilt your head to the side, there's a whole new picture. Oh! Ohhh. Once you see it, can't unsee it, right? (MILES CHUCKLES) - In the... In the living room? - It's the perfect spot for it. DAVID: He's a regular Leonardo. Painted me like one of his French girls. (CHUCKLES) First things first, yeah? OK? I need a husband. David? Um... I may as well be your sister. Plus he smirks uncontrollably when he lies. - You know that annoying smile? - That's true. - It's a lovely quality. - Alright, alright, alright. You - what do you say? - I do. I do! - Yes? Excellent! No, he doesn't, and he can't. - Why not? - Oh! So controlling. Well, you can't push Miles back into the closet. He's already dealt with his family and societal expectations. Two, do you really think that Miles would be convincing as your husband given how extra you can be? You think I'm too gay to be straight? - DAVID: I think... - What? I think you've spent years hiding your light and now that you've let it out, that wonderful, bright, exuberant light, I'm just not sure that you have a... dimmer switch. - I can do this! - DAVID: Mm-hm. I can be heteronormative! - Yes! Yes, you can! - DAVID: OK. I can be macho. I'll be the Hemsworth brother they never had. - DAVID: Another one? - Russell Crowe's country cousin. I believe in you! (LAUGHS) My God, you do? This is gonna be so much fun! - Tea? - Thank you, darling. Fine. Who am I supposed to be? Uh, you could be my personal assistant. - Oh... No. - Mmm! - Man here to castrate the goats. - What? Uh... I don't know, travelling salesman. Really, really, really, really, really, really, really old foreign exchange student. - Thank you. - MILES: I have an idea. It is so kooky. It just might work. We tell the truth. You say he is your cousin visiting for Christmas. - Great. Fine. Works for me. - Good work. OK, moving on. Darling daughter. I need a daughter, I need a kid. - (INHALES) - Let's rent one. I can call a talent agency in, like, Brisbane or Sydney, somewhere like that, and just rent a kid. I think even stage parents want their children around at Christmas. - MILES: Yeah. - Ooh. OK. Ohhh. Uh... I'm... I'm 12 in the book. - Right? - Mm-hm. Tweens hate their parents. She ran away. And you didn't notice? Poor thing, she could be anywhere by now. Hmm-hmm-mm-mm. She's at a sleepover. - Oh! - An extended... An extended Christmas sleepover. - It will have to do. - It will have to do. Now, what are we gonna do about you? - Hmm. - What do you mean about me? I grew up here. I know my way around this place. I'm fine. MILES: It's just, uh, your clothes and, uh... - (INHALES SHARPLY) - Yeah. - BOTH: Your hair. - What's wrong with my hair? No, he's right. None of this is Clementine. It's like she needs some sort of farm boot camp make-under situation. - Is that a thing? - No, it's not a thing. - It is now. - No, it's not! - Let's go shopping! - No, we're not! (MILES LAUGHS) (UPBEAT MUSIC) Fan out, people. (DAVID INHALES DEEPLY) Hmm. Hmm. Mmm. No. Do I hold one or two? - Grab it and pull. - Hang on. - (COW MOOS) - (SCREAMS) - Nothing is coming out. - No wonder she's still single. - I heard that! - (COW LOWS) MILES: It's a little bit 'House on the Prairie'. Reminds me of 'Poltergeist'. I think the mum wore something like that. (UPBEAT MUSIC CONTINUES) Ugh! (CLICKS) - Uh-uh. - No? Joanna Gaines has got nothing on you. Would your mum have approved? Is it Aunty-Clem-Christmassy enough? You know what, it-it-it-it's great. I just think you need less balls, more bush. You know, think less gaudy, more... earthy. - MILES: I am allergic to bush. - DAVID: You know what? Right now, I'm less concerned about your foliage and more concerned about your accent. What's wrong with my accent? I can still speak Australian if I need to. Say "Can I have a glass of water?" Can I have a glass of wa-ter? - Wor-ter. - Wa-ter. Wor-ter! - Wa-ter. - Wor-ter. What the hell's happening to me? Well, you've been living overseas for 20 years. - Footpath. - Paa-th. Garage, tuna. Tyu-na. Tu-na. BOTH: Chu-na! - ♪ More, more, more... ♪ - Bleurgh!

(SIGHS) I'm going on a work trip to an Australian farm with Ellison. A farm? But it's Christmas. Christmas is for nude beaches and umbrella drinks. Yeah, well, Ellison wants me to take more interest in the business. And then when I do, she doesn't trust me. So, either way, I turn out a disappointment. Jackie. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. (SIGHS) I know how much you hate your job. - Hmm. - Ah! Do you want me to get you out of it? - What do you mean? - I could show up in Australia. Scoop you up and whisk you off to Bora Bora, hmm? We have fun together, don't we? Mmm. As tempting as that sounds... - Hmm. - ..I have to work. - Oh. - Mmm. Read the book. It's amazing. The author, Clementine, she's really fascinating. Well, you know how much I love to read books. Wait. Who's Ellison? Really? - I'm so sorry, Ms London. - Don't apologise. Just do better. Ohh. Mmm! What is this? A gingerbread latte. It's festive. Do I look like a person who likes festive lattes? Who doesn't love Christmas? The only good thing about Christmas is the uptick in book sales. JACK: Ha! Well, well, well. You made it, Mother. This 'Clementine' book is the first time in a decade you've cared about anything that didn't involve craft cocktails or 4-day weekends - of course I made it. Well, you wanted a bestseller, I'm giving you a bestseller. - So... - We'll see. What end of the plane do you want? As you like. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) (WHISPERS) It's gonna be a long flight.

All... all of Christmas? It's an extended sleepover with her very, very best friends. They don't celebrate Christmas. They're Jewish. - Pagans. - Muslim. EMMY: Khan-Kaufmans. Fascinating, uh, family. Live just a couple of farms over. Could I offer anyone a Fig Tree Fizz? - DAVID: Oooh! - JACK: Yeah. Thank you. Yes! Yes, it's a delicious cocktail. Um, cousin... David, husband... Miles, why don't you join me in the kitchen? JACK: Huh. Struth! I wouldn't usually step into the kitchen unless it was to crack open a cold tinnie, eh? Eh? - (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY) - (MILES LAUGHS) Yeah. (MILES CHUCKLES) (EXHALES) Something odd about all this. It's called Christmas. DAVID: You just had to mention the Fig Tree Fizz! I haven't made one of them in years! I was trying to save the situation. "G'day, avocados"? Why should you be the only one who gets to do an accent? - What voice was that even? - It was Mick Dundee! Americans love 'Crocodile Dundee'. I... I... On the plus side, that Jack guy's pretty cute. No. No. Listen to me. Listen to me. I've met him. What? - In New York. - DAVID: What? I've met him. You 'met him' met him? - Like 'met him'... - (MILES GASPS) - Like you... you... - ..met him. - What?! - Oh, it was a one-night stand. - It was nothing tawdry. - Oh, God. Just two people looking for some companionship after drinking their body weight in Boulevardiers. That's why he was looking at you like the world had stopped! No! He was looking at me like we'd never even met. Told you we did a fabulous job on her hair. - Oh, my stars. - DAVID: Maybe... maybe... - This is really, really bad. - Maybe it's... - (BOTTLE POPS) - ..fate. MILES: It's a goddamn Christmas miracle. EMMY: Hey, are you two out of your heads? It's a goddamn Christmas disaster! He can never know who I am. Was. Am. We are living in a web of lies. Guys, this is not... He has got her frazzled. - I'm not frazzled! - Ow! I have got a book to sell and a farm to save, and if I don't sell the book, we don't save the farm. So get serious about this, fellas. Get off me! (EMMY BREATHES HEAVILY) (EMMY EXHALES HEAVILY) MILES: Oh, God. Can you pass me that knife? That's not a knife. (METALLIC BLADE SINGS AS IT'S PULLED OUT) That's a knife. - Fig Tree Fizz! - Oh, great. OK. Right. Here we go. Very special concoction right here. Won't get it anywhere else in the world. Here you go. - Thank you. - Lovely. - Love it. - Yes. So when do we get to see the rest of the fabulous farm? Oh, um... You ever seen a pregnant cow? - Oh. - DAVID: Dolly. She's due any minute. You will adore it! It is all fabulously magical witnessing the circle of life through Dolly's heaving belly. Miles... darling. Actually, uh... (CHUCKLES) (BROAD AUSSIE ACCENT) ..I've got some, uh, fences to fix, some sheep to shear, some paddocks to plough while you blokes have your fun. - (LAUGHS) - Ow. Yes, we're gonna have some... - 'Bye, darling. - 'Bye, hon. Well, I've got my, uh... I guess it's just the three of us, then. (ROOSTER CROWS) (BIRDSONG) So... which one's Dolly? Uh, the pregnant one. Dolly! Hey, Dolly girl! Come to Mama. - Wait. Isn't that a bull? - Uh... Wait. Aren't they... both bulls? No! I think we have stared at bovine genitalia long enough! Let's go see the horses. Yes? Horses! Oh, go... go ahead. (LAUGHS) I found half a bar. (CHUCKLES) EMMY: Oh, don't you just love that... Oof! ..horsey smell? JACK: Hi. Hey, what's going on? -Hey, you. EMMY: Oh, wow. That's amazing. He doesn't usually let anyone but my mum... me get that close... to him. (CHUCKLES) What's this big guy's name? Elton. And this is Kiki. - Elton and Kiki? - Yeah! You know, like Elton John and Kiki Dee, famous, uh, duet. No. I don't think so. - No? - No. How does it go? - The duet? - Yes. Sing a bit. Oh, you want... You want me to sing a duet? Yeah. A bit. I'm really... (LAUGHS) ..not much of a singer. - No? - Um... Uh... Um... OK. (SINGS) ♪ Don't go breaking my heart ♪ I couldn't if I tried... ♪ - JACK: Uh-huh. "Don't..." - I'm sorry. - Yeah. - I'm not much of a singer. And I don't really have a lot of tune. "go breaking my heart." Ha ha! - "Take the weight off of me." - Oh, yeah. I see what you're doing. You got me. "Honey, when I knock on your door..."? "I gave you my key." (BOTH LAUGH) I'm sorry. You... you just look so familiar. I... I feel like we've met. Oh, no! Uh-uh. 'Cause I live here on a farm and... ..you live in, um, New Nyo... New York, New York. Yeah. Come on! Come back, please! Oh! Oh, good. A little help! A deranged child is trying to kill me. Hello. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Who are you people? What are you doing on private property? Do you know this girl? Uh, yes, of course I know her. - I don't know you! - JACK: Ha ha! - Oh, this is the daughter. - What? The one in your book with the anger issues. You thought my daughter had anger issues? She's written that way, no? Ah, yes, of course it's my daughter! You will not take that tone with your mummy, young lady! Now, put that pitchfork down. These are the guests I told you were coming for Christmas. You're not my mother! Oh! Little Emmy took a horse kick to the face a few years back. She hasn't been the same since. I'm Violet. See? Memory is totally shot. - Oh. - Quite heartbreaking, actually. Alright, darling, if you want us to call you Violet, we'll call you Violet. - One more step... - You're acting crazy, darling. I'm not the crazy one, lady! I come here to feed the horses. (WHISPERS) Listen to me. Just go along with it and I'll give you anything you want. (EMMY LAUGHS FALSELY) - Like money? - Yes. Just go with it, OK? Please. Oh, Mummy, I didn't recognise you on account of that horse kick to my face a few years back. - Ohh! - I want the money in cash. And I want it in writing. Well, step-dada Miles will be so glad you came back from your sleepover and, uh, are spending Christmas with us after all! VIOLET: Hey! Stop it. Hands off. - EMMY: Go on! - Quit it! - Whose devil child is this? - DAVID: Hi, Violet. This is Rita Hay's daughter from two properties down. - And we pay her to farmhand. - EMMY: Oh! Well, your little farmhand almost blew our entire operation. - Operation? - Yeah. There some kind of spy thing going down? Because I can keep a secret. EMMY: I need a drink. Hey, what's with crazy lady's accent? - Remember lovely Clementine? - Yeah. That's her offspring. Oh, sad sack New Yorker. Who called me that? Who called me that? Well, whoever it is, she owes me cash. EMMY: Yeah! Because country bumpkin Wednesday Addams here now has London & London thinking she's me... her... my daughter, who should be called Emmy and is now named Violet. You're the one who said it. Wait a second. Could we borrow her for a couple of days? - VIOLET: Borrow me? - MILES: Um... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Would your parents mind if you weren't with them for Christmas, if you were with us, would they miss you? Lady, I'm number four of nine kids. No-one would even notice I'm gone. - Yes! - I'll give her parents a call. EMMY: Great. It's settled then. Listen. Sweetie, all you're gonna have to do is play make-believe. Pretend that I'm your Australian mummy and Miles here is your step-dada! - Do you think you can do that? - Yeah, I can do that. - Great! - For $1,000. You're kidding? You said you could give me anything I want. I can get a lot of things I want for $1,000. EMMY: You are a child, right? Not a lawyer with a growth deficiency? I can just go home, you know. That's fine. You're a little... 500. - 850. - 550. 700. Deal. How old are you, anyway? - I'm 10 and three quarters. - Actually, you just turned 12. Happy birthday. You're getting a wildly inappropriate cash gift. Put the hat back on! You look like Oliver Twist. One... ..two... three! (ALL CHEER) There we go. Merry Christmas. - VIOLET: David. - EMMY: Merry Christmas. - MILES: Darling. - Hi. - (MILES CHUCKLES) - Dig in, everybody. (CHATTER) - MILES: Want some more salmon? - DAVID: Thank you, darling. Uh! (CHATTER CONTINUES) EMMY: Yeah. Lots of chilli, chilli, chillies in there. (CHATTER CONTINUES) EMMY: Brussels sprouts. DAVID: Who would like some more tomatoes? I've grown them all myself. - MILES: They're lovely. - DAVID: I absolutely... It's en... No, no, no. That... that's quite enough. (CHATTER CONTINUES) So, tell me, American friends... - (CHUCKLES) - ..do you, um... ..visit the homes of prospective authors on the other side of the planet often or is this a... a special occasion? Just standard business practice. Oh. JACK: We love to... to see all our authors before we... we publish them. Oh, I had to see the Clementine magic for myself. JACK: Yeah. Uh, launching a brand is, uh... ..it's a big commitment. Oh, uh, I'm a... brand now. Um, yeah, I mean, if everything goes the way we hope it does, talking about launches in every major market, social media blitz, the whole kit and caboodle. Wow! All from... one book. Maybe even a TV show! (CHUCKLES) Oh, my son doesn't champion titles often, so his sudden interest in all things... you... (LAUGHS) ..that's what has me truly intrigued. Yeah. Listen, it's a very special book, Clementine. Oh, my God, this is so boring. - (LAUGHS) Darling! Darling... - (JACK LAUGHS) VIOLET: Why don't we talk about something interesting? Like global warming or carbon footprints. I bet you own a few boats. (LAUGHS) - Um... (LAUGHS) - One. - And it's a yacht. - Touché. Hey, darling, don't you have homework to do? It's Christmas Eve Eve. There is no school. - Ah, right, no school. - VIOLET: Oh! Look! Mistletoe! EMMY: That's not mistletoe, darling. - That's a weed. - (JACK LAUGHS) You and step-dada should kiss. Oh... - ELLISON: Oh. - No, we don't have to kiss. Don't let me stop you. (LAUGHS) 'Tis the season. MILES: Oh, yeah! Ha ha! - Get it up ya! - OK. (LAUGHS) Go, Rover. MILES: Hmm! (MOANS PASSIONATELY) (CHUCKLES) EMMY: Ohhh! - (VIOLET CHUCKLES) - (MILES SIGHS) - Wasn't that lovely? - (EMMY CHUCKLES) You guys are such the perfect match. Oh, thank you, darling. Makes us so happy to hear you say that. (DAVID CLEARS THROAT) I'm just going to go and check on the cheese platters. - Ohh. - DAVID: Miles. - Got it. (CHUCKLES) - Yeah. Yes. Go help him, sweetheart. (SIGHS) Aren't we feeling that Christmas spirit now? (DAVID EXHALES DEEPLY) - Are you OK? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Yeah! I just realised, this epiphany, that we're living in our favourite movie. - 'Beaches'? - No! 'The Birdcage'! - Oh! - It's the same! It's like I'm Robin Williams. I'm Nathan Lane! We need an Agador. Oh! Ohh. You were very... very masculine out there. It was good. - (FAN WHIRRS) - (SNORING) (MILES SNORES) (MILES BREATHES DEEPLY) (MILES SNORES) (MILES MAKES GUTTURAL NOISES) (LAUGHS) Yeah. (ARM PLOPS) (MILES SNORES) (MAKES GUTTURAL NOISES) (CRICKETS SING) (DOOR SHUTS) (LIGHT MUSIC) Ohh. Oh, wow. - (BRANCH SNAPS) - Whoa! - Oh! - (SCREAMS) JACK: What are you...? Ugh! - (EMMY SCREAMS) - Oi! Why did you just tackle me? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? It's my lake! I remembered that bit in your book where you were talking about swimming with the yabbies. I couldn't sleep. - Oh! - Are you OK? Yes. Right. That's what I'm doing here too. - I was very hot. Couldn't sleep. - (LAUGHS) And I thought I'd take a swim with the yabbies. - I do have one question, though. - Yeah? What the hell is a yabby? Oh! Well, uh, a yabby is like a cousin to the crab, only its parents are also cousins, so you don't really talk about it, I guess. Oh. Are they dangerous? You should work off the assumption that everything in Australia is dangerous. Sounds fun. - Ha. Yeah. - (LAUGHS) God, that's something your book really doesn't capture. - What? - That sky. - Look at it. It's amazing. - Ohh. Yeah. I forgot how perfect it is out here at night. How can you forget? You get this every single night. No, I forgot what it must look like to someone who's n-never seen it before. Yeah, you don't get that in Manhattan, that's for sure. Right? Just constant car horns and the smell of urine! - Oh, shit! Something bit me! - Ooh, what? What?! - Yeah, yeah. - What do you mean? - Oh! Oh! - Oh, where? - Ah! Ah! Everywhere! - (SCREAMS) Grab your crotch! - Grab your crotch! - What? Why? Because once they latch on, they're impossible to get off. - What is? - The yabbies! (SCREAMS) Shit! Let's get out! Come on! - Ow! My neck! - Which way? Which way? Neck? EMMY: No, the other way! Go! Go! - Yeah. Oh. - (JACK SHUDDERS) Here. Here. Oh. You go first. I can support you. - (EMMY SCREAMS) - (RIP!) Oh, my gosh, was that your hamstring or your pyjamas? - I don't know. Maybe both. - (JACK LAUGHS) - No. I can't... - I've got an idea. - (GROANS) - Don't do it. Don't fall on me. - Don't fall on me! (SCREAMS) - (JACK SHOUTS) - (EMMY SPLUTTERS) - (JACK LAUGHS) This is worse than the yabbies. - EMMY: Oh! - JACK: Ooh. OK. Right. Feeling the breeze? What? - Do not look. Just be a gent... - Alright. - Please avert your eyes. - I'm not looking. I'm married. (LAUGHS) Not looking. EMMY: Don't look! (GENTLE MUSIC) (NATIVE ANIMAL SOUNDS) (GREGORY CLUCKS) (DOOR OPENS) (CROWS) What? Morning, sunshine. Oh! Is that a hickey? - What? No! - DAVID: From Jack?! - No. It's a yabby welt. - In the bathroom? Why are you asleep in the bathtub? Uh... because you failed to mention my husband's snoring! - Did I? - It's my larynx. That's why I'm good at yodelling. Yes, he was gifted with a wide larynx. No-one likes your larynx, Miles! It... it... it... I need to go back to bed. - (THUMP!) - Oh. Oh! (GREGORY CROWS) (GENTLE MUSIC) (GROANING) (GROANING) Good, good. Got it. That's good. - (GROANS) - VIOLET: Careful. Alright. OK. How's it lookin'? Oh! Hey! Yep. Good and raring and... and ready to go. Alright. Let's go. (CLICKS) (HORSE WHINNIES) OK. Get here. Get... This, uh... might surprise you, but I'm not a very good rider. I haven't ridden a horse since I was your age. - I'm not surprised. - I need some fast reminders. OK? Just a few pointers to get me through. Say 'yah' a lot and don't fall off. - Yah? Yah. - Yah. YAH! - (HORSE GRUNTS) - I think you're scaring him. I think you need to help me push him or something. - Come on. (CLICKS) Yah! - I'm not pushing him. (PHONE BUZZES) (SIGHS) - (PHONE BUZZES) - (SCOFFS) Nope. Hey! Come on. (CLICKS) (KISSES) MILES: Come on. Hey. (CLICKS) Go. (HORSE SNORTS) (EMMY CLICKS) Ooh! Come on, horsey. Horsey, horsey, horsey. (CLICKS) Whoo! Ooh-ooh-ooh. Whoo! (LAUGHS) - Are you OK? - Oh, yes. I love horseriding. This is just my, uh, preferred method of saddle. You seem to know your way around a... a horse really well. Yeah, well, Mum and Dad divorced when I was young and they thought it'd be a great idea to whisk me off to the most prestigious boarding school money can buy. Oh! Fit for kings and queens, you know. - Well, that's fancy. (CHUCKLES) - Yeah. Continue. Well, as it turns out, um, co-curricular equestrian is actually a rather effective undervalued way of meeting girls. - Ha! - So when life gives you lemons. You become a charming playboy. You think I'm charming? No. I didn't... say you were charming. I just... You know you're charming. Oopsie! Hey, now. - Oh, wow! Look at the lake. - Oh, yes! (CLICKS) Come on, come on. Go! Yah! Come on. EMMY: Yah! Come on! - Come on! Yah! Yah! Yah! - (HORSE SNORTS) No, no, no, no. Not too fast. Alright. Good! (BIRDSONG) JACK: God, this place! You can just really breathe here, huh? EMMY: So you're not missing your Starbucks yet? JACK: Oh, please! I get my coffee flown in from Italy every morning. Oh. Seriously? Come on. Ah. Huh! Well, with you... - (JACK LAUGHS) - ..I couldn't really ever know. (JACK CHUCKLES) No, I was thinking after all this is over, maybe I'd buy myself a little farm somewhere and get out of that city life for a while. I mean, New York must be exciting, though. Big business, big publishing. - So... - Predictable. - Really? - Oh, yeah. What's the phrase? You know, on top of every mountain there's just another mountain. Uh... I don't think that is actually a phrase. I think you just made that up. Maybe. I might have made that up. (LAUGHS) I don't know. You're the writer. I'm just the disappointment. I'm sure nobody thinks you're a disappointment. Uh, yeah. They do. (CHUCKLES) It's OK. I definitely earnt the reputation. But finding you... ..that's something very, very good. Jack... ..there's something I want to, um, tell you... (VEHICLE APPROACHES) ..and I think that, um... ..it's important. (HORN HONKS) VIOLET: Quick! Dolly's gone into labour! What?! The bovine's about to blow, love! Now?! - The bovine's about to blow. - OK. (DOLLY MOOS) Shh, shh, shh, shh. (JACK CHUCKLES) Oh. How is she? You asked for the full Fig Tree experience. - (DOLLY MOOS) - Uh, Dolly's in pain. The calf's legs are twisting. But, um, if we all... Come here. ..work together, we can get this part over pretty quickly. - (HESITANTLY) Mm-hm. - DAVID: Alright. Jack. You look like you've seen a cervix or two in your time. Would you mind joining me at the birthing end? Uh... (HESITANTLY) Yeah. Clementine. - You are our farm girl. - (DOLLY LOWS) - Are your hands clean? - Cleaner than that. - Put some gloves on. - Ooh. DAVID: You're gonna have to help me pull. (GAGS) God! There's hot steam! - OK, we're breaching. - What?! Oh, yeah. OK. Here we go. Come on. I need you to be hands-in. - What? Grab? - DAVID: That's it. Yeah. Grab. - DAVID: Right. OK, on three. - We're pulling? - (DOLLY MOOS) - Yeah, yeah, OK. Good. - Yeah. You... - One, two, three! PULL! Oh! - (SCREAMS) - (LIQUID SPLASHES) (JACK CHUCKLES) DAVID: Oh! Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. - JACK: Oh! (CHUCKLES) - Oh! Oh. Hello! - Good girl, good girl. - (DOLLY MOOS) JACK: Ohh. - Wow. - VIOLET: Oh, my gosh. - She's so cute. - Hey. How are you? - VIOLET: She's so slimy. - JACK: Yeah. - (EMMY CHUCKLES) - VIOLET: Can I name her? Sure. - Marilyn Moo-roe. - (LAUGHS) (JACK CHUCKLES) Marilyn Moo-roe! (LAUGHS) Welcome to Fig Tree Farm, Marilyn Moo-roe. (CHATTER) (JACK AND EMMY LAUGH) EMMY: That was, um... - Really special. - Yeah. Yeah. It was. Uh, Clementine, I think you've got a bit of... ..afterbirth in your hair. Oh! Oh... Ugh! Oh, God! No, no. You still look beautif... Fine. - Oh, that's so gross! - You look fine. - It's gross! - (HORN HONKS) So... What the...? (SULTRY MUSIC) Feliz Navidad, party people! (AVALON SQUEALS) (GIGGLES) (JACK CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) Surprised, my pineapple? Yeah. What are you doing here? AVALON: I'm saving you, like I said I would. Huh? Did I mention that I still have your card number? There may just be like a tiny charge for the car and the trip to Bora Bora. - The what? - Hi! Hello, hello! I'm Avalon, Jack's girlfriend. No, uh, not a couple, actually. You must be the big-time author! Hi! Is your farm, like, 'Babe', the pig, the movie? Are there pigs? Uh... I... Yeah... yeah... No. No, there are no... no... no pigs. Oh! Bummer. Well, that's too bad. You both look so festive in all that black. Drinks, anyone? Fig Tree Fizz? - AVALON: I am so sorry... - (MOUTHS) ..to intrude, everyone. It's just that, um, I really need Jackie's help. Um... my grandmother is sick, you see, um... - Oh. - (CRYING) Sorry. Sorry. Um... she, uh... she ran out of her medication on vacation in, um, Bora Bora. Uh, and, uh, I have to go and I really need, um... really need Jack to come to Bora Bora with me. ELLISON: If your grandmother needs help, I'll call my personal physician. It'll be much faster. Uh... well, the thing is, um, Granny is with her, uh, gentleman friend and he, uh, is trying to sell her... her body on the Bora Bora black market. Awful. I'm sorry, I just, um... Excuse me for a minute. JACK: Hmm. - Mmm! - (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) Yeah. (DOOR CLOSES) (GENTLE MUSIC) (MUNCHING NOISES) Miles thought you'd need it. Oh, thank you! I... I do. I need it. Is this about that gazillionaire guy? That's not even a real number. Did you see her? Ohhh! I mean, she's like... ..perfect, like a... like a... ..like a princess in... Louboutins. And you're...? Sitting in a pantry stress-eating with cow placenta in my hair, pretending to be somebody I'm not. With a 10 and three quarters 12-year-old. Lady, I've known you two days, and on the whole, I'd say you're a... whole ice-cream store of crazy. - OK, this is really not helping. - But he likes you better anyway. You think? D'uh! Of course he does. Now, go get yourself cleaned up. (LAUGHS) Oh, God! (BREATHES DEEPLY) CLEMENTINE: That's the way it rolls sometimes. There'll be great days, there'll be good days, and there'll be bad, not fun, downright ghastly days. But if you stay strong and never, ever give up, you'll find a way to make even the wildest of dreams... (DOOR CLOSES) - (SCREEN DOOR CLOSES) - ..a reality. (UPLIFTING MUSIC) ♪ Oh... oh ♪ Oh-oh... ♪ - (HORN HONKS) - Oi, Clem, what's the hold-up? - I'm here. - Good. You're in the back with Jack and Avon. - Avalon. - DAVID: Avon... alon. - (WHISPERS) She looks hot. - I know. (CHATTER) - So tell me how you guys met. - Mmm! Uh, it's, uh... it's not really a very interesting story. Stop! It was at Leo's New Year's Eve party two years ago. I was working as a brand ambassador for Egg-Vod. - Wow. - Uh... what? What? What? Oh, cute. Um, it's this eggnog-flavoured vodka. You have to act like you like it, sell people on it. But you can't let them get too drunk because if they barf, then they'll forever associate with the brand. - I'm glad I asked. - JACK: Mmm. It takes real talent. EMMY: Mm. Mm. Anyways, um, how did you and Clementine meet? I haven't read your book. Sorry. - Ahh. - Ohh! Bloody romantic, mate. You want to tell this one, Em... Clem? - No. I... No. - No? True love should be shared. Long story short, Clemmy was a reporter from the big smoke. Mmm! Then she flew on out to... ..Walkabout Creek. - EMMY: I guess. - MILES: You did. I-I-I-I... I... I did.

(LAUGHS) - (KISSES HAND REPEATEDLY) No-one wants to hear this boring story. Yes, we do! - Oh. Yeah, OK. - That's... Yeah, OK. Uh... Before we knew it, we were chasing buffaloes and hunting crocs!

Pure like my home brew. You know, that... that story just... It sounds so familiar. (CHUCKLES) Wait. Uh... I thought you guys met in a creek. (UNCERTAINLY) Yeah... BOTH: Walkabout Creek. Yes!

Here's to... lunch... (FLY BUZZES) ..among the gum trees. So may your jumbucks stay jolly and, um... The prawn salad's melting, Clem. ..may all your Christmases be bright. DAVID: To Clementine and the beautiful world that she created here at Fig Tree Farm. May it always prosper. - ELLISON: Merry Christmas. - VIOLET: Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! - AVALON: Merry Christmas! - JACK: Merry Christmas. MILES: Merry Christmas! EMMY: Whoo! DAVID: Up your bum. Up your bum. Phwoar! Um, why don't we, uh... Sorry. ..move this inside? JACK: Yeah. Inside. Inside. (JOLLY MUSIC AND CHATTER) - Alright. Got it? - Yeah. I got it. (CHATTER) (CLUCKS) (BONBON SNAPS) - Whoa! - Winner wears the crown, right? Have you ever ridden a kangaroo to school? No. You look very nice in all that colour. JACK: It matches your eyes. (WHISPERS) You're actually having fun, Mother! Why do Australians hate the word ketchup? Why do Americans hate the metric system? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. AVALON: Do you really eat Vegemite? Or is that just a cruel joke you people play on the world? You tell me. Where did you get that? - (DAVID SPEAKS) - Oh, sorry. - You can have it. - No, you go. - Mmm! Yum! Yum! - VIOLET: Have more bread. - JACK: Oh. Look, you go. - You can have my strawberry. There's plenty. May I? Yes. - Ooh-ah! - (GAGS) (CHATTER CONTINUES) JACK: Um, can I have this one? (LAUGHS) That was absolutely the worst throw I've ever seen in my life. You're the worst catcher. Try again. Ooh! (LAUGHS) You're trying to break my teeth. - EMMY: That was close. - Another go. - Oh! (LAUGHS) - MILES: Anyone need more plonk? - Plonk? - Plonk. Alcohol. A drink, love. Oh! I can't. I'm so tiny. - I'll be so hungover. - (EMMY LAUGHS) Well, we could always use Clemmy's old hangover cure. Oh, yeah, vinegar and milk! That'll stop you from wanting to drink ever again! (CHUCKLES) Vinegar and milk? I met a woman recently in New York and that was her remedy as well. What a coincidence! Whoa! You met a woman? Which woman, Jack? Hey, why don't we have a game of Christmas charades? MILES: Hey! VIOLET: Um, OK. - Um, two words. Uh... movie. - AVALON: OK. 'Now I See You'. I know, 'cause it's right there. There. You're the "Blue da-ba-da-di" girl. I know a bad dye job when I see one. Maybe the men don't have the eyes. But I see. But I'm not blonde. (LAUGHS) So... AVALON: What about poor Miles? Isn't that your wife with my boyfriend? - I'm not your boyfriend! - AVALON: Oh. And she's not his wife. - You two are a couple. - What? JACK: Miles, I saw you. You were grabbing David's ass. I was actually thinking it was a weird throuple situation. - EMMY: Oh, my... - MILES: How ridiculous. - Ridiculous! - I am her hubby. - Yes, he is. - Oh, give it away, guys. Come on. Who the hell are you, really? I'm sorry, Jack. ELLISON: She's the magical Clementine Jones and you bid a million dollars on her book. JACK: Yeah, I did. But she's not. Technically, I did... I did grow up here on Fig... Tree Farm, but... my mum created all of this, not me, and... and the books are... well, from her j... journals. Mm-hm. I knew your accent sounded kinda fishy. Because, like, who the hell talks like they're on 'Downtown Abbey' when they live in the frickin' outback? - It's 'Downton Abbey'. - And who's this? Uh... We borrowed Violet. She's not really my daughter. Rented, actually. Rented her. I feel sick. You feel sick? Samesies. I'm sorry, Jack. (LAUGHS) Yeah, you're sorry. You're sorry. - As long as you're sorry. Yeah. - EMMY: Not... Sorry. Mum, she's sorry. That's good. Yeah. (DOOR SHUTS) EMMY: Jack. (GENTLE MUSIC) Hey. The little girl from the book, right? Yeah. Have you any idea how many people I have working on you and this book and your social engagements? What do you think's gonna happen when they find out little Clem they've fallen in love with in the book is just a complete... - A fraud. - Heh. Was any of this real? I suppose that was no chance encounter we had in Manhattan either. All part of your little plan, hmm? No, no. That was... (LAUGHS) ..fate, maybe. I don't know. I could never have known that you were going to be the guy who bought the book. (DOOR OPENS) I had no idea until you showed up here. I don't know what to believe. It's just like... Jackson. Time to go. EMMY: Oh... (JACK GROANS) (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (JACK GROANS) What is in here? AVALON: Get in. (ENGINE REVS) EMMY: (TEARY) You be good to your mama, OK? You only get one. (KNOCKS) (GASPS) Hi. The fancy people are leaving. MILES: You're gonna let him drive outta here? You can't just give up. You always find a solution, Em. He hates me and rightly so. I messed it all up. I messed it all up. No. Come here. Shh. I know you don't want to hear this, but I wouldn't be your best friend if I didn't say it. Yeah. What would Clementine do? (KISSES) She'd tell me to chase my dreams. Yeah. That's your answer. I just miss her so much. I know. VIOLET: Ohh. We all miss her, honey. Mmm. (KISSES) Every minute, every day. Ahh. OK. Oh, I've got make-up all over my face. Do I smell like cow? - Yeah. - MILES: Yes. Thanks, Marilyn. DAVID: What are we waiting for? VIOLET: Christmas? DAVID: Come on. - (EXCITING MUSIC) - DAVID: Come on! - This is crazy! - MILES: Come on, let's go! - (ENGINE STARTS) - Good luck! (ENGINE REVS) Whoo! - EMMY: Come on! - MILES: OK! - EMMY: Miles! - MILES: Yes! DAVID: Come on! We're coming for you, Jack! AVALON: I don't know about you people, but I am so ready for a piña colada and a beach and a massage. Oh, you should see the resort. It's so beautiful. You're gonna love it. Ahhhhh! Oh, my gosh. This psycho does not stop! - (EMMY SHOUTS) - Pull over! (TYRES SCREECH) DAVID: Avalon, where'd you get your licence? - For Christ's sake! - EMMY: Jack! - I'm sorry. - Have you lost your mind? I don't know. Maybe. Oh! Ellison! Ms London! Please don't be mad at Jack. He had nothing to do with this. My son trusted you. I don't appreciate being manipulated, personally or professionally. Then you're gonna not appreciate what I have to say next. - The truth is... - JACK: Whoa! Are they still coming? You're gonna get yourself killed! I'm in love with you! What?! Stop the car. What is wrong with you people?! - A horse! - JACK: Whoa! Whoa! (SCREAMS) Merry Christmas! (JACK SCREAMS) What the hell is wrong with you? Are you crazy? You know what, I might be a fraud, but you're one too! Not the best start. You're not who you pretend to be. You're not this suave, lady-chasing playboy that you pretend to be. You're more than that. You do care. And meeting with you, it was one of the best surprises of my... of my life. And if I let you go, I will regret it every day. Every... Christmas for the rest of my life. - So just... - "Don't..." - Just "Don't..." - (EMMY SIGHS) (SIGHS) "go breaking my heart. "Oh, honey, if I get restless..." (WHISPERS) Everybody's watching us. (MOUTHS) Your speech was actually pretty good. Don't leave me hanging here. "I couldn't if I tried." (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS) Are you kidding me right now? You want this... over this? - Uh! - G'day. OK. I see what's happening. - Avalon, listen. - And I get it. Shhh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Shhh. - Hey, we... - We had some great times. - Didn't we? - Uh... Shhh! But I now pronounce you dumped and single. You may kiss my ass. ALL: Oooh! (AVALON SHOUTS ANGRILY) We were not a couple. I can't stress that enough. - Uh-huh. (LAUGHS) - (CAR DOOR SHUTS) Close the door! - (KICKS DOOR) - My luggage. - I'm so sorry. - (ENGINE STARTS) - (ENGINE REVS) - MAN: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - (WOMAN SCREAMS) - MAN: Whoa! She's like Dua Lipa. But she needs a burger. ELLISON: I finally finished your 'Clementine' book last night. Wait. What do you mean? You came all the way to Australia and you just finished the book last night? Did it ever occur to you, Jackson, that maybe I didn't come all the way down here just for the book? Maybe I also wanted to spend some time with my son. The book is good. You were right. And if this woman can finally get your head out of your ass, I can only imagine the hold she'll have on the rest of the world. Wait. So does that mean you still want to buy the book? Yes. As for you two... Uh-oh. You were a couple this whole time? Why, yes, ma'am. And you don't really talk like Crocodile Dundee? No. (LAUGHS) Unless you want me to, you drongo! - (LAUGHS) - Drongo. We'll work you into the book promotion. You're hilarious. Was that actually her finding something hilarious? (LAUGHS) I think so. I want to be her friend. - I want her cravat. - Let's go. So, now what? CLEMENTINE: One, two, three, four.
