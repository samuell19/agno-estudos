This is the 22nd century, the land renewed. The air and water pure again. The conflicts of the past are gone. It is a new Earth. New peoples and new customs. In some places, bizarre savagery. In others, advanced cities. Everywhere new challenge and new adventure. And this is also the story of Dylan Hunt. Lost in 1979 in a suspended animation accident. Over a century and a half later in the year 2133, he was found and awakened by the people of this city called PAX. Peace. The one place on Earth which escaped the final conflict of the 20th century. The one place on Earth where civilization did not perish. Dylan Hunt is one of them now. Leader of a PAX Science team exploring a much changed world. Part of the PAX dream of rebuilding on Earth, a new and wiser civilization. Their mission is mankind. Rebirth of... planet Earth. Dylan Hunt, log report to the PAX Council. Per instructions, we were escorting Pater Kimbridge on a survey which has confirmed that Central California is now an inland sea. Population along the shore is a handsome racial mixture. Illiterate but intelligent. Although the land remains fertile, famine is common. Their primary need from us is education and agricultural techniques. With those facts determined we headed homeward when the ambush occurred They were Kreegs. That mutated form of human capable of understanding only machinery and warfare. It was clear that they recognized who we were and wanted us alive. Possibly because they've heard that underground subshuttle tubes honeycomb the earth and that only we of PAX, know the secret. Slowing our progress was the age of Pater Kimbridge, his rapid exhaustion. Each of us in turn tried to divert the Kreeg vehicle while the others moved Kimbridge nearer and nearer a subshuttle tube entrance, where we hoped to escape. There he is, over there. Team, switch to XY tranquilizers. Our standard hypos aren't stopping them. Message received, we're reloading. Isiah, divert them. Isiah. That thing is from your century? Yeah, we call them automobiles. It's fantastic that it's still running. It's a late 1970s chassis with a converted wood gas fuel system. There. No, get the Pater. There. Dylan, don't. Keep down. They won't try to take us alive anymore. Go ahead. Isiah. Lock it. Hurry. Looks bad. He's alive. Hurry, it's still here. Team 21, arriving in four minutes. You'll have a medical team standing by? And an operating room. You say you saw signs of still other Kreegs out there? Perhaps a whole expedition? Affirmative, suggest you cut off tube power at that point. We can't get let them get hold of a subshuttle. Agreed. Power is terminated. - How is he? - There's definite heart damage. You can close the medikit now, I've done all I can with it. And with your mind? Try. He's slipping away. He's dying. Isiah, please.. Ah, let the savage pray. It'll help as much as anything I can do here. Concluding log report. If Kimbridge dies, the responsibility's mine. And our return to PAX has made the burden no easier. To me, Kimbridge is PAX. Its grace, its warmth, its dreams of helping Earth rebuild again. He is the man who discovered my body in suspended animation. Whose skill brought me to life again. Whose wisdom helped me to understand that the best of my own 20th century is not dead. That Earth is still my home, it's people still my people. Dylan, Baylok needs you. Pater Kimbridge is coming out of surgery. Dylan. How is he? Well, the bullet sheared of a section of the pulmonary artery. He can last only a couple of days without bio-plastic prosthesis. Now, the only surgeon qualified in that is a Dr. Rabans who-- He's in the eastern Mediterranean area. How far is he from a subshuttle station? Uh, two weeks at least. There's a slim second choice. A Dr. Connor who trained under Rabans. Jonathan? But he disappeared on a team mission about a year ago. We've made attempts to locate him, of course. - Where was he last seen? - Back the way we came, several hundred kilometers further on. Our equipment's waiting at the subshuttle. Log entry 324. As the first PAX team available, we are headed for what seems our best chance of finding Dr. Connor alive. Hope that the Kreegs are moving in another direction by now. Our destination is an unexplored region out of which have come stories of a strange Amazon society. Where males are bought and sold like captive animals. Women's lib. Or women's lib gone mad? Officer Smythe, you call Dr. Connor "Jonathan." How well did you know him? I mean, did you know anything not on the tapes that might be useful to us? He did once mention he'd heard of some plant mutations in that area. He was interested in the medical properties of any new plants, found after the Great Conflict. That could explain how he got separated from his team. That's our one hope. He became separated and was captured by those women. The tapes list several reports of men being taken captives. Hands bound, led by a rope around the neck. Pater Kimbridge has only 60 hours left. Just finding Jonathan in that time is once chance in a thousand. There's one way we can cut those odds a little. We're going to split the team. Baylok and Isiah will take the subshuttle to the old power station that's listed in the diagrams. It's near the heart of the area. Hopefully near a main village or a town of some sort. You'll immediately identify yourselves. Try to explain to them who and what PAX is. And why they have a lot to gain and nothing to lose by co-operating with us. As you say we will do, my friend, but, to split the team-- Yes, isn't that-- It'll give us two separate and different shots at our objective. If yours doesn't work, ours might. You'll drop us in part of the way near a place where we can pick up some horses. We'll carry no weapons and just one transceiver. We'll ride into the Confederacy of Ruth. Where you'll tell the first women that we meet that you've heard of their system of female dominance and that you believe in it. What makes you think they'll accept that story? I'll be proof. Your captive, as described in the tapes. Bound and led in by the neck. You. Have Partha send out a second team. I want this field ready tomorrow. You're on your own HS. Who are you? I've come to join your Confederacy. I brought a male captive from my country to prove I agree with your beliefs. What do you know of the women of Ruth? I subscribe to your principles. Female dominance is the natural order of life. - Eyes down. - Stop that. Eyes down. He hasn't been properly trained. But he looks healthy enough to bring a good price. I challenge your ownership. But--but it's obvious that I own him. You saw me ride in with him. I've just challenged you for this male. Will you fight for him or not? But there's no reason to fight. I have come in friendship. I-- He is my property! He was your property. Uh, there's another man from my country, miss. Uh, Jonathan Connor. He came here about a year ago. I've explained to you, the rule here is silence. But, perhaps this friend of mine and myself can help you. We can be a value to you. You have men pulling wagons, ploughing fields. This friend of mine knows how to train horses to do it better, faster. Or even oxen. Why? You Dinks are more easily trained. You take care of yourselves, you grow your own food. Why should we bother with animals? That's the second time you've mentioned training. What kind of training? We don't geld our males if that's what worries you. It would make them too fat and lazy. But if you break the rule of silence again, I'll make an exception in your case. This way, Dink, follow me. - Greetings, Marg. - Fine day, Bronta. Villar. Another outsider? You haven't enough of them, Marg? I'm putting this one up for sale. His manners are tricky. Eyes down. Hands don't show much heavy labor. That'll affect the price. Eh, but his lines aren't that bad. Teeth are good, eyes clear. Couldn't you use a new breeder at your place? No spirit. No, he came along too willingly. If you can get a breeder price for him, all the better. Now listen carefully, wherever you're from, you're a Dink now. Untrained, but still a Dink. The rules are made simple so that even a male can understand them. Show obedience at all times and you'll find happiness in service to the community. As long as your behavior warrants it you'll be protected, fed, clothed, relieved of all the responsibilities that your sex finds so difficult in life. It's a mutant group named Kreegs and they're dangerous. Silence. Look, I'm trying to help you. Your Confederacy may be attacked any time now. This is not a chaotic, male-dominated society. We are fully capable of protecting ourselves. Remember, you'll keep eyes down and keep silent. Look, I must have the answer to one ques-- Silence! One question! And then I'll obey all your rules. I thought Marg said he had no spirit. Well? I have a friend who disappeared in this area about a year ago. If he's alive and he's here, I must find him. Is there something about this particular Dink we'd remember? Was he unusually large or small? Deformed somehow? No, but his name is Jonathan Connor. The only name a Dink owns is the one his mistress chooses for him. That is, if she cares to give him a name at all. Now, eyes down. And silence. I'm looking for someone-- I have to find an outsider who-- Baylok, Isiah, what happened? Well, how did you get here? What happened? Tell me. Dylan, please, your voice is angry. You, on your feet! C'mon, get on your feet. Get over there. I have a buyer interested in you. First sale today. A team of outsiders recently captured. You'll find this one well trained. As powerful a field Dink as you'll ever see offered. Examine him as close as you like. He's a bargain in strength and stamina. Look at these shoulders. Look at these back muscles. Well, if he's as strong as he looks, - I'm interested. - Wow! - Yeah, I'll bid for him. - And I. Baylok. - Wait. - Go away. What have they done to you? What's wrong with you? Listen, look up at me. Try to look into my eyes. - Look into my eyes. - Please, don't hurt me. I won't hurt you. Try to meet my eyes. Try. It's your friend, Dylan. You're an Esper, shut out all of this. Concentrate on what's inside you. Your eyes, keep them on mine. Keep them on mine. It's just the two of us. Our eyes, our contact. Dylan...I'm frightened. Why? Have they operated on you in some way? O-or given you an injection of some kind? No. No, nothing medical. Well, were you given something to drink then? No. Water. Food. Isiah and I... ...we both...ate the food. Something, so--something in the food. Do--don't eat the food. D-don't eat. It contains something. Don't, please, go away. Leave me. Frightened. Drug induces fear. T-terrible fear. Fear. Six and six, done. Can I get six and seven? - Seven. - Can I get six prime sheep and seven bushels? I bid a ram. A ram! Six prime sheep and eight bushels of grain. Do I hear nine? - Kyla. - No. I won't go that much. Let's see the other one of the pair. Get him. Nine bushels, Bronta. Remember, he might have breeder capacity. If you like 30 pound babies. Are you certain he's completely trained? He's trained. My bid stands. That's too high for me. Sold to Delba. Another eight bushels for this one? No, he'd last about two days in the field. They're up as a pair. You take both of them or neither. How about that one instead? The outsider? That's prime breeder stock if I'm any judge. Yes. I like him. He'll be offered as breeder stock tomorrow after training. All right. I'll take him and I'll reserve this one. Not so fast, Delba. I need a breeder too. He's got spirit. I may bid for him myself. I hope training won't affect him too much. We'll want him tested, Villar. - Agreed? - Agreed, you'll see him tested. Thank you. I told you that west section was arable, Merlo. Then next month, we'll do even better, mistress. The door. An outsider. I'm lost. I'm trying to-- Go back the way you came. We want no outsider female ideas in our Confederacy. I've seen more hospitality from savages. What do I have to do? Fight you just to get simple directions? That is your right, of course. You challenge me? Yes. I want some directions. And I'm damn well gonna get them. Mother! There, there, there, there. Don't cry. Mother. I'm sorry. i-I didn't see the children. I'm sorry. Come by the fire. It must have been cold out there. It's all right. You see, we're not unkind. Conduct yourself properly and I'll leave your hands free tonight. Now, eat. Eat! Eat! I must find him tonight, please. I can't explain-- There's nothing you can do until the morning. All new captives must be kept overnight in the compound. Do you enjoy the music? That was my great-great-grandmother's strike harp. It's lovely. Then the other man I described? Connor? You can ask about him in the village tomorrow. When you challenge Marg to win back your captive. But why do you have customs like that? Challenging, fighting. Because women don't deceive themselves like men. Male societies reward deceit and cowardice. Here, as in nature, the strong have the best mates and households. In nature, the female is always dominant. When that natural order is reversed, men become the same vain, quarrelsome little seed carriers who lied and postured and drove the whole world into destruction. We'll be at full strength tomorrow sundown, Commander Soldier. Position units. One to attack each female household. Their males, they will not fight. No, Commander Soldier, the woman do something which make men fear their own shadow. Yes. Commander Soldier, sir. Sub-units ready to inspect. Well... Have you seen him? Jonathan Connor? If you worked here at the village last year you must have seen him. He's about 35 years old, 5'10" and he-- No, no. No, I've never seen him. Pretend to be asleep. - Hmm! - Quiet, quiet. - I'm looking for an outsid-- - Back to the compound! You remember that rule of silence? It's still in effect. Not one word. We're getting some horses and you're gonna help me find my friend-- There, you look more like one of us for your challenge tomorrow. Beautiful, mistress. The Dink extract wasn't always used on the men here, was it? In the beginning, it was given only to troublesome males but over the years, our women have begun to depend on it. It's in a gruel that Marg delivers everyday to most of the other households. Which makes it impossible for anyone to learn Marg's formula. The secret's been in her family since our beginning. But by using it so much now, it's slowly destroying our Confederacy. Not one household in five had a child last year. Pity, he didn't respond to the extract. He would have made you a nice profit. Delba wanted him badly as a breeder. Bronta, too. Are you certain you saw him eat the gruel? How long have I been running this compound, Marg? Do you think I can be tricked? He tricked me, Villar. I didn't think he had any spirit. Delba's right about one thing. Excellent lines. None of which changes the law. He must be trained or exterminated. Please, please, don't hurt me. Hurt you, little man? I have more interesting things in mind for you. Come out here, Dink. Eyes down. Damn, your whole-- What did you say to me? He's fighting it. More than any we've had here in quite a while. Yes. Has Marg's outsider been sold yet? No, Delba. Good. ...sold to Carlotta. Next we have an outsider captive of exceptional spirit. His resistance to training promises a good breeder. I'm not so sure I'm putting him up for auction. That's unfair. I've just ridden all away in to bid on this one. You agreed to auction him, Marg. Bring him up. Don't be shy, Dink, you'll get used to it fast enough. Look at the spirit on this one. - Are you ready, Delba? - Yes. Stop. I'll do any testing that's done. He's still my property until he's sold. Hold on, Villar. This is Harper-Smythe. She's here with a challenge. That Dink is my property. I captured him and brought him to the Confederacy. I challenge any claim you have on him. You've received a properly issued challenge, Marg. Either give up the property or fight. I'll fight. Harper-Smythe, over there. Fight, Marg. You won him fairly. Marg is offering you friendship. We feel no shame here after we've done our best. At her age and with his spirit, we'll have little ones about soon. I'd give half my fields for a baby. What do you expect of your males? If you drugged your rams and stallion, it's the same way. Are you still peddling that nonsense, Treece? The human male is an unstable creature. Who can easily be controlled by any real woman. Unless she's afraid he'll end up by dominating her. I'd like to see the male who could dominate me. Perhaps that's exactly what you'd like. Secretly. Stand still for your mistress, Dink. Dylan, it's me. Harper-Smythe. Everything's all right now. Come closer, everybody. Harper-Smythe is looking for another Dink who came here about a year ago. Yes, I'd be interested in buying him. He was a medical healer in my country. About 34 years old. Brown hair, hazel eyes, intelligent features. I've bought most of the outsiders in the last few years. You're welcome to come and look for him at my household. That's true. Marg does own most of the outsider Dinks. And you can easily visit the other households from there. Why not stay with me? Welcome home, mistress. You see the order, the tranquility of our system? I certainly think there's some sense in female dominance. But I don't agree about the drugging. The extract has its strongest effect in the beginning. But as they become accustomed to it, why, they're content. Why they're--they're even happy with it. The Dink you're looking for? - You've more in the house? - Yes. Perfect contentment. They take great pride in their work, their responsibilities. - Is he here? - No. There're many in the fields, of course. They come at sundown. Welcome home, mistress. Another busy day, Gorda? Thank you. Not a brain in his head, but he's a comfort. I'm sure. Until yours adjusts to training, you might find Gorda much more helpful and amusing. Oh, no, thank you. Your room is this way. Dylan... This way. Pater Kimbridge is still not responding to the heart machine. Repeat, Kimbridge critical with 15 hours of life at most. Please confirm your understanding of this. Fifteen hours, message understood. Team 21 out. Do you understand? We must find Jonathan. Must find...Jonathan? Dr. Connor. Pater Kimbridge is dying. Dylan, you're drugged. Keep fighting it. Fighting. Trying. So much fear. - Fear of you. - We mustn't be-- Help. Help me! Dylan... I want to help you. You're frightened you won't please me. That's how the drug works. See? You do please me. Does this help, Dylan? Does this make you less frightened? Yes. Doesn't this prove there's nothing to be afraid of? Help me. This...this makes you happy? Yes, Dylan. Mm, Dylan, Dylan, we--we have to find Jonathan. No, Dylan, no. Jonathan? Jonathan. Jonathan, do you recognize me? I'm not drugged. Who's he? My team leader. Here's an antidote to Dink extract. Mix it with water when you want him to be himself again. We came here to find you. You're needed urgently at PAX. Urgently? Pater Kimbridge needs heart surgery in the next 15 hours or he'll die. Drink it all. Or you'll displease your mistress. The damage to the heart requires bio-plastic surgery. - Dr. Rabans? - Can't be reached in time. If you could just escape to the subshuttle station... Marg would miss me immediately. I'm due in the cooking shed. After she bought me, I was put to work where she makes the Dink extract. Even drugged, I could recognize simple distilling equipment. And once I recognized the process, I avoided eating the gruel until my mind began clearing. Who--who are you? You'll be all right in a minute. The extract is from a mutated plant which produces a fear fascination syndrome on the central nervous system. The antidote was easy since it's similar to compounds isolated in the 1960s in biochemical warfare labs. You're Dr. Connor. Yes, it's Jonathan. You've been drugged. I know. - You gave me something? - An antidote. Listen, we've got to get you back to PAX. I know about Kimbridge. But there's no way I can leave now. Or maybe there is one way. Harper, you must tell Marg that you want to trade him for me. She wants him. Everyone in the household knows it. Maybe we ought to tell him what she wants him for. I know, I remember parts of what happened. Parts? Marg, usually oversees the gruel shipments to the other households. If you can get her distracted from that she won't notice I'm gone. - I'll try. - Good. This Dink may just have a surprise for her. Get her occupied and I'll leave with Harper. As a woman, she can take me anywhere without questions. What in the devil kept you here if you weren't drugged? I've been accumulating a supply of the antidote. Waiting for a chance to get it into the gruel they send out from here. In that way, it would reach Dinks in almost every household. Do it. I mean, on your way out. With her help, it oughta be easy. Tell PAX that I'll look for Baylok and Isiah and-- Marg. What are you doing in here? He's the one I was looking for. This one? I saw him from the window and called him in. Yes, he is a handsome devil, isn't he? I paid quite a price for him. I'm sure. I wonder, could we make an exchange? That is if mine interests you at all. Well, it would hardly be an even exchange. Mine's extremely well trained. But you are my guest, so I agree. You're very generous, Marg. Thank you. Dylan, you're to go with the household mistress. You belong to her now. - You handled that well, Harper. - You think he'll be all right? Marg can be dangerous. It probably depends on how well he understands female psychology. I don't think he knows the first thing about it. Perhaps. But you can never be sure about us Dinks. - Excellent, Gorda. - Thank you, mistress. Does the mistress wish something done with this ugly one? No, I may want him after I see the gruel wagons loaded. Get up! How dare you sit with me. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, mistress. I--I'm--I'm so used to sitting with my wives when they take-- Silence! You've had no permission to speak. Yes, mistress. You said wives. Did you have several wives at the same time? I only had 14. Some had more. Fourteen? Huh! Well, you must've used them for many duties. - Cooking, weaving, field work? - No, no, mistress. Our wives are used only to please us and to bare children. Gorda, you're being a nuisance. Get out! All of you, get out! Typical male vanity. Fourteen wives is totally ridiculous. A male hasn't lived who could properly see to just one of us. Well, you found that to be true, didn't you? I've had 41 children in the last five years, mistress. You're lying. The male creature is unable to produce children in those numbers. Your bodies as feeble as your intellect and just as unreliable. But, mistress, the males in my country are trained from childhood in certain practices which...make us different. Practices? What are they? Show me. Oh, well... Well, first, I need strength. And then, of course, we would require a quiet place. Gorda. Gorda! Yes, mistress? Have this food brought upstairs. And tell Partha that he'll be responsible for the gruel shipments today. Come. Four pots. Ship to the village later today. Gorda, have you seen your mistress? She is upstairs and has asked for wine. - May I hurry there, please? - And the outsider who-- He is with her, mistress. May I hurry, please? All right. Wine, does that mean anything? It's kept for guests, mainly, Marg rarely takes any. They're almost finished making the gruel. Mm, it's the proper color. Well, get out. Out! You've tricked me before. If you're lying about any part of this... Eat! Stop dawdling over your food. Mm, good. Wine is necessary? A proper wine is most important to the ritual, mistress. 'Course this isn't exactly the right kind-- No, please don't. It's all right, Dink. I just wanted to sure of something. Get up and eat. You frighten me, mistress. Nothing will work if I'm frightened. I'm not angry with you. See? I'm quite...pleased with you. While you're in my quarters, you may take certain liberties. You are permitted to look up at me. To speak freely. And...touch you as necessary? Of course you can touch me. Just why do you think you're here? All right. Now we begin. - This will be for you. - I don't care for any wine. Oh, but this is necessary, mistress. We must...join in chemical conditioning. Conditioning? Oh, you must drink it, mistress. My body has been trained from childhood to be excited by the action of wine on your biochemical structure. All of it, mistress. Our chemical configurations must balance. Now... The first test. That's strange. I should feel our balance beginning. Do you feel any balance yet? I seem to feel something. I definitely feel something. Yes, it's beginning. But it's only a shadow of what it should be. We'll need a...second assimilation. All of it, mistress. Balance is critical at this point. The entire place could be cleaner. How long has it been since the equipment had a thorough going-over? And I've other complaints, too. The fires are built wastefully, requiring too much fuel for too little heat. The gruel is far too thin. Altogether, you've been careless in a number of things. But I'm sure you'll try harder now. I'll say nothing of this to the household mistress. Just this once. - Partha. - Yes, mistress. I need some exercise. He'll ride with me. Two horses. You...promised...we'd be balanced. I know I'm balanced because I feel balanced. Perfectly, perfectly! Perfectly? Not quite. Our bio...our bio...you-know-what's are nearly there, pussycat. See here, Dink. You may not call me... What did you call me? Pussycat Pussycat. You don't talk like a proper Dink-Dink. You certainly don't act like a proper Dink-Dink. Dink, Dink. Dink. What shall I name you? Already got a name. Say hello to Rip. Rip? Rip Van Winkle. Born February 3, 1944, Fire Creek, Colorado, in the good old US of A. Colorado? Mm-hmm. What do you think of that, my girl? I know I'm balanced. Why aren't you balanced? Well, it...because it takes a while at my age. Born 1944, that makes me 189 years old. How 'bout that? Marg of the Confederacy trapped in the clutches of a 20th century male chauvinist pig. Mm. Who's willing to admit that females in charge is no more upside-down than our system was. Women's lib. Men's lib. What do you say we dump 'em both, Marg? People's lib. Are you for people's lib? I'm for balance! Please. Please. What a lovely word. Please. I don't think we need any more of this, Marg. We're there. No more words. I think we're ready for a little nonverbal mutual... respect. Marg, it's Kreegs! Get out of here! Outside! I am going. You, come! Pardon me. Shoot him! Partha! What are you doing? You're being foolish. I'll give you all the food you can carry. Just leave this household as it is and I will be able to continue to supply you any time you come here. Yes. Your land very rich. We want the secret. Secret? Yes. How you turn men into frightened rabbits. You offer farm goods when you have that? Gorda. Did everyone get the gruel last night? - What? - The gruel! - Did all the Dinks eat the gruel? - Stop that! Yeah, I guess they did. Come on. I tell you, there is no secret. You lie! Move! - Move! - There is no secret! Our males know life is pleasant here, their needs are cared for. You lie to a manly soldier! Now tell! Why do wagons come here each day? From here, what do they take? You do not fear me. Soldiers. Bring other female. What can we do? Do? There are only six of them. Look how many there are of us. This female has also lied. I'm sorry. I hoped you'd seen them and escaped. We show reason to fear. Fight! Fight or they'll kill you! Well, come on! Careful, my friend. Harper! Harper! Are you all right? You were doing very well without our help. Marg, are you sure you're all right? They fought for me. My Dinks fought for me. Because they're no longer drugged. We'd all be dead if they were. Know every household has fought like this. It's happened over the entire Confederacy. Connor, we need you. I just spoke to Pax, Kimbridge is hanging on. We almost made it to the subshuttle last night. Well, there's still a chance if we can make the subshuttle fast enough. Gorda, we need two fast horses! You can use the medikit here. Here are 200 horses! Come on! Connor, Baylok, Isiah, get in! HS, help with the injured, I'll be back for you. It's agreed, then? All our households will try it without the extract? Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. But it won't be the same. Imagine a household with undrugged males underfoot. Chattering, making mischief. And children, perhaps. It's true, Isiah, there were millions of cars in my century. All over the world. HS. Any word yet? Yes, I just received a message that Jonathan reached surgery in time. - And the Pater will be all right? - Yes. Oh, that's good news. For you, friend. No thanks, tiger. So you'll be staying on? I'm almost sorry I can't stay on, Marg. I'm not. You're the worst of everything that's vile in the male species. She laughed at me when I told her about the 14 wives. Your 41 children. Your...secret ritual. I've never felt so demeaned, so insulted, so-- Hungover? Come back, Dylan Hunt. On equal terms? On balanced terms. - Men. - They have their place. Here's Dylan now. Pater, it's good to see you looking so well again. He'll be running with our young people in a few weeks. Harper-Smythe tells me you've had some most unusual experiences. Oh, yes, Pater. Did she mention that I was her Dink for a while? As a matter of fact, she didn't. I don't think we should tire the Pater with too many stories. Oh, I want to know. It sounds very interesting. No, actually not. Dylan was drugged, he hardly knew what was going on. Actually, most of it's beginning to come back to me, HS. Oh, except the part with you, that's a total blank. Were you a good mistress?? Not nearly as good as Marg, I'm sure. Marg? I don't think we should tire the Pater with too many stories. The 22nd century, a reborn planet Earth, a thousand new adventures. This has been one of them.
