1942. The South Pacific. The New Year finds USS Enterprise and her crew of 2000 men preparing to deliver greetings to the Japanese in the form of torpedo bombers and fighter planes. With last month's attack on Pearl Harbor still fresh in the minds of these American aviators that revenge is a dish best served... Piping hot! Chief, this is Aldrich. Uh, I'm losing her on the Hayrake. Come on. Where you going? Chief, I've lost the beacon, over. Are we close, Chief? I'll give him a tap. Maybe his comm is down. Chief? Can you hear us, over? Loud and clear, boys. Just waiting for this wind to tell me which direction she wants to blow. Pastula, take another drift sight. That's not how I'm reading those wave tops. Yes, Chief. 15 degrees. Same read as the outbound, Chief. If that's correct she's off to the east. I had her west. I'm taking her east. 6-Tare-14 requesting an inbound bearing, over? Chief, we've broken radio silence! Affirmative. We need a bearing. Confirm you're on 79. Seven-niner confirmed. I reckon we're still too far out. Well, keep trying. Blue Base, this is 6-Tare-14. Do you read? Come in, Blue Base. Over. Chief? Go. On the MF. I heard Jap talk. I pulled the plug. Roger that. Let's go silent on Morse. Silent on Morse, affirmative. How are we on fuel, Chief? Low. Pastula, we need to make altitude. Drop the ordnance. Aye-aye, Chief. Bombs away. Aldrich hit that MF. But the Japs, Chief. Do it! Blue Base this is 6-Tare-14. Do you read? 6-Tare-14 to Blue Base. Come in, Blue Base, over. Like hell she's east. Enterprise, this is 6-Tare-14. Do you read? Get on it, Aldrich! I'm on it. We're out of range. Boys... before we run out of fuel. Snug up your vests and stand by for a water landing. Understood? Damn! Affirmative, Chief. Pastula? Aldrich, gather the flares, the smoke candles and the first aid kit. We're going to need the flashlights. Pastula, grab the rations and the water and ready the life raft. And keep your heads, boys. Pass this back. Got it. Coming through. Grab a parachute! A parachute? Prepare to ditch. Brace for impact! Ahhh! Pastula! Here, chief. Aldrich! Here! Step lively, boys! C'mon! Chief! Ahh! Oh, no! Come here. Damn thing won't inflate! Ahh! The valve is jammed! Train that beam. Unship your weapons. They're dragging us down. I can't get it! There goes mine! Mine too. That makes a difference. This... Damn thing. There it goes! It's too heavy to lift! Maybe if we-- Aldrich! If you get trapped under there again just deflate the vest a little bit. Swim down and out. Understood? I can't swim much. You're kidding. You? Not really, Chief. Oh! For crying out-- Okay. This is gonna be hard to turn over in these swells. If we take off our vests string 'em together, tie one on here and throw the other across then we go around and pull. Good idea. Except neither one of you can swim. Just have to hold tight to the hand rail. Real tight. Okay, let's give it a go. Here. Alright. Okay, go around and I'll toss it over. Okay. Ready? Yeah. Here it comes! You got it? Alright we got it. Alright, get a grip. Now heave like you mean it! One, two, three! Hold her down. I'll go around the other side and climb in. Kippers in a can got more space. Let's try laying athwart. Aldrich... when I was on deck. Didn't get a good look at you. Harold Dixon. Gene Aldrich. You'll get a gander in the morning, Chief. I'm sure I'll be here. Pastula. Is that Italian? Polish, Chief. I've made a couple of hops with you before. Oh, yeah? I don't remember. We'll be picked up come morning. You reckon, Chief? That's what I'm hoping. Hoping? Come early morning, they'll be on us like an old hound dog. It's so damn hot inside that plane. It's freezing out here. Cock-a-doodle-doo, boys. Well, we made it. I worried she wouldn't keep us afloat but she's still ship-shape. Thank God. Gene Aldrich. Now I know you. I couldn't put a face to the name. In all my glory, Chief. Who's up for a fresh cup of coffee? Henree! Time to put on the pot. Yeah. Thanks, Henry. 'Henry'. Why Henry? Oh, it's that show, you know, off the radio! Henree! Henry Aldrich! Nah. Never heard of it. You were gonna land in the drink, I thought 'Boy... Thought I couldn't land her, huh? Wasn't that some flying! I mean he just laid her right down. Yeah, he sure did. You know, Aldrich I've been wondering... I don't understand how you couldn't raise that carrier. We couldn't have been more than 20 miles out at one point. Even at 40 you should've caught something, right? You tell me, Chief. How far out were we? We should keep our eyes peeled. Right? Everybody take a point. We need to cover 360. Good visibility. Yeah, they'll check every square mile out here. It'll take a while, but they'll do it, won't they? Even if it takes all day or into the morrow. Yep. Could take most of a day. They'll do a box out to 50. Even a 100. They've got the viz. Divide that by the number of planes. Heck it's likely to be this morning. Maybe we'll get a real breakfast, huh, Chief? You figure we'll see 'em first or hear 'em? Shh. See that speck? That's a bird. It ain't moving its wings. Wait... That's something, all right. Steady on her course, whatever-- It's one of ours! Hey! Hey! Get down! Get down! Got plenty of time to drown. I think it's an SPD. She's on a bearing. About 140 knots. Half a mile out. Pastula, grab the parachute. Spread it on the water. Chief? No parachute. Aldrich, how about those flares? I couldn't hold 'em, Chief. Well, wave something! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look down here! Hey! What are you, blind? Sun's behind you. Check your three o'clock! Down here! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here! Down here! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look here! Come on. Where you going? No-no-no. Where-- Hey! Hey! We're over here. Hey! Hey! Come on! Hey! Hey! Hey! We're here. That was our one and only chance. What? That was our search. What do you mean? They can't just leave us here! Could be he saw us, he's goin' back for help. Why didn't he break course? Because he's on a box search is why. Next pass he'll be out of sight. Maybe there'll be more planes double-checking. Or ships. What the hell are they telling you in boot camp? We are at war, Aldrich. We're in the vicinity of enemy naval forces. We get one quick look at best. Like you said, there's a procedure. Alright. No parachute or flares. I don't suppose the chart board made it either? Affirmative. First aid kit? Everything's gone, Chief. Including the rations and water. Oh, God. I don't get it. I gave the orders in plenty of time so I could get busy with the landing and we have no food and no water?! We were pretty busy not drownin'! How are we gonna survive out here with no water? Okay, coming aft. Listen up, lads. This raft is a vessel of the United States Navy, and I am her Captain. As such, I will be giving the orders and you will be taking them. Are we clear? Aye-aye, Chief. Aldrich? Crystal, Chief. Alright. Let's take an inventory. Pockets. Everything. Pile it on the shirt. Got two magazines. I got my pocket knife. Keep that in your pocket! The last thing we need is a hole in this raft. Pair of pliers. A bit of wire. Some cord. Maybe about 20 feet. Here's a whistle. Aldrich. Rubber cement fluid. Any patching material in there? Yeah. Huh. Look at this! We can use it if we see another plane. Wish we would've found that earlier. Huh. And a water bag! Aha! It's empty. That's all she's got, chief. No fold-up oars under that thwart, Aldrich? Negative. Don't forget about the handrail. That's about 25 feet of nylon. Yeah, and we've got these two life vests. No oars. No flashlights. No map. No food. No water. Chronometers? Negative. No. No. But if she stays afloat at least I can figure her speed and distance. She looks practically new. That's good. Ah, here. Manufactured 11-30-37. That's four years old. Plus some. Boys, we should minimize the wear on the fabric. Shoes. There's not much room. On or off, they're liable to scuff. I say we deep six 'em. They say it's five miles deep out here. That's impossible. Chief? I'm thinkin'... Maybe one of us should keep 'em. If we make land somebody's going to need to walk. Makes sense. Hey. I've still got this. For a boy who can't swim you were a fool to keep it. Well couldn't get rawhide loose. But you never know. It might come in handy. Youngstown, Ohio. You? Sikeston, Missouri. Sikeston? Where's that? Nowhere. Pastula Take another drift sight. That's not how I'm reading those wave tops. Yes, Chief. 15 degrees. Same read as the outbound, Chief. What? If that's correct then she's east. I had her west. Aldrich? Not a peep on the Hayrake. I reckon you've flown us to the middle of nowhere, Chief. We're lost! Say again, Aldrich? Aldrich! That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. That you have never had a Kentucky Hot Brown? So you're not allowed to eat food from neighboring states? No. Glad I don't live in Ohio. Ham and cheese. Now you're talking. I must of made a 1000 of those in the Civilian Conservation Corps. The C's? Me too. I cooked for a hundred fellas. Two cooks and no food. So, how'd you end up Navy? Well a few too many mouths to feed at home. My mother thought I could become more disciplined. Hm! Imagine her disappointment. And I was ready for an adventure so I enlisted. Well, you sure got an adventure! Yeah. If my mother could see me now. Hm. I wanna make it a career and see the world. Career navy? Good for you, son. In these troubled times there is no higher calling. You think it's possible we get seen at night, Chief? Wouldn't rule it out. This yellow raft, moonlight might-- Well no full moon tonight. We'll schedule a watch anyway. Four on, eight off. Who wants first up? I'll take it. I can't sleep anyhow. Alright. I'll take second watch, Pastula. Okay, chief. Told me to rouse you up. Reckon it's been about four hours. See anything? Just ocean. Did you have anything to drink yet, Aldrich? Drink? What? Oh, you gotta be kidding me, Chief! Oh, tha-- That's just wonderful. Oh. Watch? Nothing. Pretty steady breeze though. Henree! Time to put on the pot. How long's the breeze been up? Uh, an hour, maybe. Same direction? Uh-huh. Chief? Pastula. Where are we? 1900 miles to Hawaii. Samoa's a 1000. South America, 6000 at least. That's a lot of zeroes. But we are moving. Flat bottom craft like this will sail along smartly and we've been getting some 12 knot winds. A six-knot wind will give us a drift of one. I bet we can get a two point five out of 12. Although she sure does like to change her mind though. So Hawaii. Yup. How come you didn't point that way? Dead ahead? The way the wind's blowin' us now. The Phoenix Islands. The Gilberts. Tarawa. 600 miles or less. Tarawa? Aren't there Jap subs out there? Great. Jap army's crawling all over those islands right now. What happens if we land on a Jap island? Or a sub finds us? There could be a sub underneath us right now. We would certainly be a prize. But we have a chance. All we need is some favorable winds There are islands between us and Samoa. 600 miles away. Two knots or so... I'd say a couple of weeks, Could be a lot more accurate if I had my chart. We'll starve to death first! Well... Plenty of fish in the sea, right? If only I had a hook and a line. Alright, Aldrich. There's your line. Some braided cord in that pocket. Huh. And here. Maybe if I can get one of these magazines open we can use one of those springs as a hook. That could work just fine. Alright. You know what I could go for right now? Come on. Fish fry. A nice deep-fried basket of cod. A side of slaw and some potato salad. Whole thing smothered in cheese. Really? Hey, there ain't nothing that can't be improved with a good slab of cheese. There you go. Alright. How's that? That ain't half bad. Need a sinker. Kinda looks like a piece of meat. Well... let's cast her off, alright. Watch your eyes, there she goes! Huh. Whoa! That was quick! Come on, gimme a hand with this! - Alright. - Come here. That's the way, boys! Guess something down there's hungrier than us. Sweet Mary. Here. Put this on your head. Suit yourself. Hey! What is it? It's nothing. For a second there I thought I might be in line for a medal. The Navy Cross or something. Then I realized there's not much heroic about sitting in a raft and starving to death. Navy Cross... We'll be lucky if we don't get charged the cost of a new plane. Aw, heck. It isn't anybody's fault, right? Perfectly good torpedo bomber lying on the bottom of the ocean. Sounds like it's got to be somebody's fault. Damn fish aren't biting. Whoa, whoa. Where are you going? There ain't no fish. Which means there ain't no food. I can't take the heat no more. Yahhh! Come on in, boys! Water's fine! No, no, one at a time. It's 2,000 to Hawaii, you said? Don't get too far, Aldrich. This boat's moving, you know! Real live bait out there now, huh, Chief? That's another problem. Sharks? I don't know if they'd attack. I've heard arguments both ways. Hey, Gene! Chief's wondering about sharks. Ah, jeez! Where are you going? Just a few more strokes, Aldrich. We need to stay with the raft. I think if we hang onto the sides we'll be safe. The others can stand guard. It did get the blood pumpin', though. Pastula? You're next. No, thanks. That's why you gotta do it last. Because if you broil it for too long, well... And if you go too short, it's not gonna melt evenly. It's beautiful, isn't it? It'd be better if we could eat it. I was doing alright, see? I didn't expect no A. This the mechanic's course? No, it was another one. Oh. I thought I ought to get a B or anyways a C and that would've been all right. You know, I never really cared about making the best marks in school, as long as I learned the stuff. Uh-hm. And I had this course down good. When I saw that report card and saw that big shiny F I just said the hell with this bull crap. Excuse my language. So what did you do? I just walked out of school and And you had that course down good, you reckon? You bet I did! But I'm assuming you aced that mechanic's course. Ah, did well enough, Chief. So you could dismantle and reassemble a drift sight much less take a reading on one. Yeah, guess I could. Yeah? Just strange, that's all. I had us headed west. Your sighting corrected us east You asked for confirmation and he gave it you. I'm discussing this with my bombardier, Aldrich. I know you confirmed it. I'm just saying, it's strange, that's all. Okay, Chief. Strange alright. Henree! Put on the pot! Pastula? Ain't there a rule a guy can have a handful and still be okay? Sucks the water right out of your brains, they say. Coming up on 120 hours. Five days, not a sip. How come we ain't dead? We've been soaking ourselves not moving around too much. A couple shoes full of the yellow stuff. While it lasted. Not even a rudder. But you know where you want us to go. Right, Chief? I know, but to calculate-- Ahh! Chief? A pencil A pencil? A gol' darned ever-lovin' pencil! You see that? I can make a chart! Pastula you said east two to three knots on your watch, huh? Uh-huh. Aldrich more like southeast two to three? Yeah. Affirmative. Okay then. Here we are by dead reckoning. But where we headed? With luck, right here. There's a chain of 'em to our south-west. Closest friendly land in the Pacific. Now if this favorable wind will just push us there. What if it just keeps shifting, Chief? Chart don't take us nowhere. Unless... Unless we can hold our position in the headwind. Aldrich! Untie the handrail. Pastula I need you to take some of that wire and you make a frame to keep this from folding up in the water. Can you do it? You bet chief. Leave one end tied. Okay. Okay, good. Here, hold him up. Hold him up. Perfect! That, sailors is a sea anchor. We may not be able to control the wind but we can avoid being blown the wrong way. Huh! That's nice work, Chief. Now I'll be yelling Henree! Put on the brake! Whoo! Look at 'er grab that water! Hey, Tony, look! I'll be danged if I don't see a tear of joy on old Chief! He said we were too dried up for that. Why, I do believe you're right. Really? You saw a tear? Okay, let off the brake! Men, it isn't easy. But it might be worse. If we can keep this wind and just get a little rain. Well it never hurt to ask. Dear Lord Gene! The only prayers I know are in Polish. I hadn't marked you for a church-going man, Aldrich. I'm sorry to say I'm not much of one. That's alright. Just follow my lead. Dear Lord we know we ain't always done right by you. We're askin' for a little help here during this trial. If it so pleases you. Uh... And, Lord watch over all the men back on our ship. And all the ships at sea including this one. Tony? Dear God I'll go along with what the other guys said but mostly we need some rain, Lord. Rain, dear Lord. Please, rain. Please. Amen. Oh, come on! Give him a second. He's got to cook it up. Or maybe... That's a good one. Hey, Chief. You got one? Uh... Big finish! What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Hey... Hey! Hey! Battle stations boys! We've got precipitation! I've got the bag. Here it comes. Get as much as you can! Looks like your prayers worked, Aldrich! You're going to have to thank Sunday School at First Baptist Church, Chief! C'mon you stupid fish. Haven't you ever seen a fishing line before? A week of nothing. By golly, Aldrich, you are the most patient fisherman I've ever seen. Where I come from you don't catch, you don't eat. Just going about this the wrong way, that's all. Knife in your pocket like I told you. If you put a hole in this raft... If we don't eat soon we might just as well, Chief. Aldrich you stow that knife. That's an order! If you don't catch you don't eat. Aldrich... I hit one! Stop it! I hit the raft! I hit the raft! God! You idiot! Don't move. I'll get the cement! It ain't the raft, Chief! Oh, shit! Pastula! Ahhhhh! Don't let him go! I think I got it. I think I got it. Nice work, Pastula. Atta boy, Tony. It fell out of the sky. A shark just fell out of the sky. Oh! Ah, geez! Looks like she just had dinner! We've got bait for another day or two. Probably some for an extra meal as well. The salt will keep it. How far we got to those islands, Chief? According to the chart roughly 390. Wind's out of the northeast which is just right for us. And if she switches on us, we just throw on the brake. No backsliding. We're going home. And boy will my wife be sore. Damn. I thought he was only married to the Navy. Neither of you boys are married? Nope. I got a girl back in Youngstown. Irene. Not me. But... I'd like to someday. Hey, I got a sister. You two would get along. No kidding. What's she like? I don't know. People say she's like me. It's not much of an advertisement Pastula. She don't look like me. She's, you know, easy to get along with. And a lot prettier than me. Describe her to me. Really? Yeah, really. Five-four. She's got long brown hair green eyes. This is kind of weird, Gene. Keep goin'. She's a wiz in the kitchen. She likes to read. She wears clothes She wears clothes? Well, I should certainly hope so. Clothes are not a requirement in my book. Hey! That's my sister you're talking about! And when we get through this I'll thank you for setting me up with her. She sounds lovely. Uhh! We got company. Must be all the blood in the water. I've heard they can smell it for miles. What do we do? Well, for starters I say we cancel the swimming program. Ah! Ah! Ah! What's the matter?! I got bit! Cease fire! CEASE FIRE! Let me see, let me see. Oh, geez. Three teeth marks at least. One nail's ripped off. Oh, Gene. Here, Chief. Well, I've heard of fishing by hand but that's ridiculous! We'll get a better look at it in the morning. - Keep pressure on it. - Okay. What do they call us, Chief? What? "Missing in action" or what? Lost at sea. That's how they carried us. Lost at sea. No trace of aircraft or personnel was found. Our father who art in heaven hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth... Tony. Give me the gun. Huh? Give it to me. Oh, Gene. I wasn't... Shhhh! Wanna eat or not? I got him! Great shot! I got him! Hey, Chief. Atta boy, Chief! Come on, Chief! You got it. Good work, Chief. Oh, shit! What's that? Double time, Chief! Come on, Chief! Come on, Chief! Ohh... The slide's jammed! What? No! Come on! - Fast, Chief! - Paddle, paddle, paddle! Come on! Come on, Chief! Come on! Almost there! Come on! Look at the size of him! Ain't bad. Could use cheese. Huh? It could use cheese. Tastes like chicken. Raw chicken. So I thought when you saw a bird it means you're near land. Not this bird. They range thousands of miles. I still can't believe you shot an albatross. Why? Never mind. Tony, c'mon. Eat up. I don't blame you. I'd leave if I could, too. Pastula, take another drift sight. That's not how I'm reading those wave-tops. Pastula? Aldrich! We've lost Pastula! ...nowhere, Chief. We're lost. Aldrich!! Enterprise! No, check that! 6-Tare-14 requesting an inbound bearing! ...Enterprise.. Enterprise! Enterprise! Help me!! There's no watch. All hands on deck. I gave orders to maintain a 24-hour watch. And you're sleeping on duty! What difference does it make? If that wind shifts and we don't deploy our anchor we lose ground, Aldrich! I don't feel any wind, Chief. It's because their ain't any. It's been dead for two days. Shut your mouth! Just shut your mouth!! I ordered a watch, there will be a watch! Sure, Chief. Whatever you say. No you won't, Tony. You want a damn watch so bad why don't you sit here staring at nothing all day? I do my share. Are you? Then where are these islands you told us about? Yeah. They must be close, right? Don't you touch that! You boys, you can't even swim much less read a map! Let me ask you something. How'd you come up with that chart of yours anyway? I-I-I studied the area map in the ready room every day. I have a rough picture of it in my mind. Plus or minus 10% After that it's simple dead reckoning! A rough picture? Dead reckoning works when you know where you're starting from, right? So this route you've figured is based on where you think we went down followed by a bunch of estimates after that on where we've gotten each day. What's your point? My point?! The reason we went down is because you didn't know where we were That's why we couldn't find the ship. That's why I couldn't raise her on the radio. You had gotten us so far off, we were out of range! I-I tried to take that into account. And that's with instruments and a real map! And here we've gone all these days without so much And the first couple of days we hardly kept track. And you're gonna put us on some teeny islands in the middle of all this? I, I... All a big guess Now, listen. Yes, yes, yes, I'm relying on my recall. I may have made a few estimates, but I-- I was trying to head us dead center to these islands so even if we were off somewhat What do you mean "was trying?" When were you expecting to see them? Three days ago. Or four. There should be islands all around us by now. We missed 'em. We missed 'em. That's the way islands are, Tony. Didn't you know? You raise 'em and they're past. It's a one chance deal. You miss Hawaii, next stop Tokyo. Now, you listen to me... It's dead reckoning alright 'cause I reckon we're dead out here! You want to take over smart mouth? Guys, please. I don't give a goddamn! And you're mister high and mighty. Keeping your shoes after we've thrown ours away. About the radio like I'd missed somethin'! "What did Aldrich do with the radio?" You're all over Tony about his drift sight because he got the same read on both legs. Well, what the hell besides getting us lost on the biggest body of water in the whole damn world? Chief? I've lost the beacon, over. Are we close, Chief? Maybe his comm is down. I'll give him a tap. Chief? Can you hear us, over? Loud and clear, boys. Just waiting for this wind to tell me which way she wants to blow. I think I fell asleep. It was so hot It couldn't have been more than a couple minutes but... So we missed the turn and by the time that we made it... It was way too late. I got us lost. And I don't know how to square it with you boys. Ever. I can't. I'm a pilot who lost his plane and his crew... And myself. I'm terribly sorry-- I'm terribly sorry, men. I'm sorry. This map ain't much. But it's the only thing we got to get us home. Looks like the only wind we're generating is our own, fellas. I reckon so. That Is exactly what we need to do! Where are my shoes? Oh, here we go. No, no. Give me your knife. Please give me your knife. Okay. Gentlemen. Let's make our own wind. Tell you what... Whoever sees land first, gets a dinner. Anything he wants, anywhere he wants. The other two are buying. Deal! Stroke! Stroke! You won't find that funny in a few minutes! Henree! Put on the pot. Okay let's get to it. Gene? Either of you know insurance? Insurance? Life insurance. I have a $5,000 policy to go to my mother. Was Wondering if she was able to collect. After a whole month I'd imagine so. I wonder how Irene's getting along. Sounds like a real nice girl. She works for a doctor now. You said that. I used to write her poetry. We'd sure like to hear one of those poems. That's right. Give us a poem. Tony? Look alive, boys. We might be getting a drink. It's a strange one. Earhart. You know that woman flier? Amelia Earhart. She went down in these parts, right? Here it comes! That was chilly. Another shower? I don't like it. The clouds are movin' in opposite directions. What is it? Get ready. We're going to have to bail fast. Are there hurricanes in the Pacific? Affirmative. So when's hurricane season? Why do I keep asking these questions? Take this! You can't swim, remember? You know what I could go for right now? Get down! Chief! Chief! Where is he? Where is he? Chief! We're coming, Chief! Come on! Come on, Chief! STAY WITH THE RAFT! HANG ON! Gene! Where's Tony? I lost him! Work your way around. See if you can spot him! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Zdrowas Maryjo, laskis pelna You okay? Chief! Chief! Good boy. Alright we have to flip her! On my mark we'll lift and let the wind catch her. But hold onto it. Yeah! One! Two! Three! Lift! You go around the other side! I'll hold it down! You get in first! Lock on! Rub-a-dub-dub Three men in a tub. And who do you think they be? The butcher, the baker the candlestick maker. Turn them out knaves all three. How is it I just now thought of that one? The raft'll sink won't it? Yeah. There'll be nothing left of us. No. No one will know we've survived all this time. No. Suppose one of us dies. What do the others do? Gene, you're always talking about food. What do you think? The liver, anyhow. The heart if you can get to it. Well, we lost the pliers and your pocket knife. Well, the kidneys would be easy. Yeah, one for each man. I think we need some other kind of talk. I'm trying but everything's so far away. Just remember something. My wife. She had a pretty yellow dress. She burned a hole in it with her cigarette. So she sewed a little white dove over the hole. I can picture the dress and the dove but I can't really see her face. Tony? I do believe I am in love with your sister. Huh. You'll make a great couple. I want you boys to know if we had made it I would've put you in for commendations. If they would've listened to me after my court martial. Court martial? Pastula can you think of anything they'd be court martialing the Chief for? Not a thing I can think of, Aldrich. Me neither. I'm sorry it had to end this way. A man plots his course but the Lord decides. Alright. Enough of that bullshit! Seems to me if God chose our course it's because he wants us to make it! Right? Either way we've come way too far to give up now. Ahh. Tony. Tony. Gene? Gene? Poor Tony. Uh. Tony. I hear music. What kind of music Tony? Can you hear it? I see a beautiful field of corn. I- I saw our fleet twice yesterday. I don't know. Somethin' green. Have a look, Chief. Gene Aldrich. You have won yourself a dinner! Land ho! Land ho! Land ho! Thank you. Thank you. Paddle, boys. Paddle! Paddle! Stand down. Stand down. We should drift right in. What if there's Japanese? What choice do we have? Square away, men. We might be going over. It's going over! Uh!
