The cassava tree is there Go home, go home, and take with you A drum and a kempur Padang Sambyan is west of Badung Where are you from? Where are you from? Jakarta. Show me the necklace. Let me see. - Let me see. - He wants your necklace. The necklace. Do you know about this necklace? This is called a Gronongan necklace. It contains the placenta from your birth. It contains your placenta. Balinese people always have these necklaces. It contains your placenta. And this necklace will take you back to where you were born. Take the necklace back. Actually, I'm here because... I know you're here because you're angry. You must be confused. Don't worry. It's all right. You are a child who was not raised by your mother. A common story. The placenta was separated from your mother. It is now of this earth. Do not go to where your mother is. First, go to the places of the dancers. Find Kaler, the dancer from Ubud. - Mayun. Ketut is here. - Yes. Let me introduce you. He is my nephew. - Mayun, has the bedroom been cleaned? - Yes. Don't leave the box there. Take the suitcase inside. This used to be my mother's bedroom. Hello, Rani. Where are you? Please answer me. Rani. Rani, answer me. I've looked for you everywhere. Mayun! Take the suitcase inside. Don't just stand there. What are you staring at? Go on. Take it inside. What are you staring at? Duck meat, bananas... What is it now, Mom? - What is it? - Sorry. I have to take that box. I am somewhere, Mom. I need to find something by myself. Count. Come on, count. Count, count, count. Count. Morning. Hello, Mrs. Dewi. - Hello. Who is this? - I'm Made Kecubung. Made Kecubung. You're chirping early today. Did you join the ritual this morning? Today is the "Tumpak Landep." I did. How many cars and motorcycles took part in it? Just one motorcycle. All right. What do you want today? I want to request a song. Which song? The same one as every year. - Today is Sarah's birthday, right? - Yes. Yeah. I received the cake. Please thank your wife for me. Which song is it? I've forgotten. "Que Sera Sera." - "Que Sera Sera." - Yes. - From Doris Day. - Yes, ma'am. - Is the north-facing offering ready yet? - Not quite. But it will be soon. We're not ready here either. Mrs. Dewi looks tired because her husband's away so much. I will go and fetch the drinks. - Mrs. Dewi? - Yes? - When will your husband come? - He'll be back in three months. - Three months? - Yes. Excuse me, I'm leaving. Hey, pretty girl. FETUS Dr. Bulan, are you sure about this diagnosis? I'm afraid this is definitive. Dr. Yudi, the obstetrician, suspected something, and the USG scans that have been diagnosed by the radiologist. It's been confirmed that the fetus in your womb is "ancephalus." "An" means no and "cephalus" means brain. So the bone... The skull bone and the brain have not formed properly. And we know that the brain is the source of a life. So the baby may only live for a few minutes. It happens all the time in Western and Eastern societies. It can happen, and the cause has not yet been established. So you have to accept it. - Is there any way to cure this? - This is the reality. There are only two options now. Option one. You could abort your pregnancy safely in a hospital under a doctor's supervision. Option two, you could choose to give birth to the baby through a normal procedure. You will have to choose between these two. Okay? Dewi, have some tea first. I will make you some tea. You can take a short rest too if you want. I want... a man... who can turn my heart into a flower. I want a man who can turn my heart into a flower. - Morning. - Morning. Those eggs are cute. Is it difficult to make these? Morning, ma'am. - Hello. - Hello, ma'am. - Morning. How are you? - I'm good. I want to extend my stay here. My room hasn't been booked, has it? - No. - Okay then. - I will extend my stay here. - Okay. - I will leave the key there. - Yes. That's okay. - I'm leaving. - Okay. Such a cute dog! See you later. - May I look around? - Sure. - Mayun, have you packed all the costumes? - Yes. Make sure nothing's left behind. No flower ornaments, no fans. I'm taking Maharani now. Where's Soka? Soka! Work! You're working to support your own kids! Don't put the ones you have cut here! Come on! Do your work! A girl has to be strong. Hop. Slower. Not too assertively. Remember when you were small? - Have you forgotten? - I prefer not to know. If you could do whatever you liked, what would it be? Nothing in particular, but I want to ask you something. You have a good motorcycle now but you choose bad roads. You could take a good road if you wanted to, but you choose bad roads so your passenger will have to hug you. You notorious, Kaler. You're always taking pretty dancers for rides on your motorcycle. So why aren't you married yet? Marriage is one thing, motorcycles are another. I've said it before. Mother is old now. She's alone at home. She has two sons. Kaler and Mayun. - You two are afraid of marriage. - That's not it! When you had a bad motorcycle, you never took me for a ride. Now you have a good one and you still don't. You don't like to get too close to me except perhaps in the "Tumpak Landep" rite when you asked me to make the offering. I'll be happy to take any dancers on my motorcycle if they ask me to. Then why not me? Now we learn this. Your hand is like this, and you move it like this. Why have you bought a TV? You still owe me a lot! This is my brother. He gave me this TV. Why would you give her a TV? You should give her vitamins instead! It's just a used TV. "Just a used TV"? Next time, don't give her stuff like this! I will get going now. You should just do your work and buy vitamins for your kids. People here... - People here buy necklaces, food... - Soka. - Why make such a fuss? - Just get a job! - You better get a job. - You're always flaring up like this. Be quiet! Don't interfere! Let her buy a TV. It's her own money. Why has she bought a TV? - She needs entertainment. - What entertainment? She needs... What do you call it? Everyone needs entertainment, even babies in the womb. She bought a TV while she still owes me money! I'm sure she will pay it back. - She has no job but spends money on a TV! - Stop making such a fuss. Don't be like that. She has the right. Let her be. Why are you defending her? - You're right. It's none of my business. - Where are you going? - I have an appointment. - What appointment? - You know. - What do I know? I have an appointment with a friend. - Where are you going? - Stop fussing. I'm leaving now. You grumble to yourself all you like. Mayun! The bike doesn't need cleaning! What's the matter with you? Are you stressed? Stop rubbing it! You will make the color fade. Mayun! What's the matter with you? It doesn't need cleaning! Why do you keep doing it? You will make the color fade! Just be patient! You're so impatient! Anyway, this is fate. You don't feel it, Mom! How could I not feel it? How could I not? I do feel it. Be patient. Just like the fruit of a coconut tree. Don't think it's only the old fruit that falls. Young fruit can fall too. What are you looking for there? My child, if you are born into this world To be a warrior Be a good warrior Neither wealth nor pleasure nor merit Is the true goal Of a good warrior Do you want to draw some water? May I have some of your water? Sure, just do it like this. So that's how you do it? My man takes the frangipani from my hair. Oh, baby. Whose child are you? FALLEN SEEDS Tonight's headline. This year alone, there have been three cases of women killing themselves and their children, and also a case of woman murdering her child allegedly on grounds of economic hardship. There has already been much discussion about the reason for these crimes. One of them has been poisoned. The one who was sleeping wore shorts because they didn't have AC. The mother drank it herself. Would you like to dance as Gendari? I can't dance. I'm not a dancer. All you have to do is play a mother role. Gendari is a mother of 100 Kurawas. And she blinded herself out of love. She gave birth out of jealousy. She really wanted to marry Pandu, but she went to other man because she was jealous. But I didn't come here to dance. You just have to play a mother. - Every woman wants to be... - I've never been a mother. And I don't want to be a mother. It's a story about breathing life into a baby. Tomorrow we'll perform this story about mothers from the Mahabharata. Would you like to sit down? Why would I sit while giving birth? I'd just squat like this. Two. Three. Good, that's it. Now, I take up the baby. This is the story of a mother's love for her child. My beloved child You have been born From different Stories But All of them Are about love Gendari, the mother in the Mahabharata Has given birth to you With prayers and love May the lord Love you And endow you With long life This is The story Of a mother's love For her child My beloved child You have been born From different stories It's such that you can't choose Your own way When the placenta was separated From the mother The life started from itself Like tree roots Looking for water Oh, my child Gem of my heart Be born Be born Like the radiant sun Which streams through the universe Your rays will always Fill my life Although the night blankets the day Your rays Forever burst free The moon reflects them But I am Not worthy To raise you Your presence Is like A brief twilight Hello, Dewi. How are you? Feeling better? A little calmer now? I couldn't sleep last night. So, I don't know. My husband called. He calls every night. I'm not sure whether to tell him or not. - What do you think I should do? - Just a moment, please. Hello. Yes. I told you earlier. It's up to you. It's all right if we separate. The children are grown up anyway. I'm sorry. So what do you think, Doctor? Excuse me again. Yes. Yes. I leave it all to you. No! No! It's enough. I don't want to. No. Up to you. What do you mean by "going home" anyway? - No need to go home. - Yes. I'm at Dr. Bulan's place. - No. - No. Just a check-up. I have to have a check-up every month. Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. Call me later, okay? I already made it clear. I don't want to be victimized. I choose to be free. It's enough. I've had enough. Ma'am. Who are they? Which one are you? Which one is me? Guess. Three girls. Big sunglasses. You must be this one. The prettiest and the slimmest. No, I wasn't. We bought those sunglasses in the '60s. You weren't even born then. That's true. I wasn't born in 1960. - At that time... - The song is... - You know that song? - Come on, come here, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, friends I'm here, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, lover Who is this? Grief and sadness This is Emperor Hirohito. And that's his wife. That's the ambassador. I have my back towards the emperor because I'm dancing. Very pretty. This must be President Soekarno. How old were you here? Yes, I was lucky. I was 12 years old when I was invited to dance at the palace. And this is the father of the man who has that nuclear power program in North Korea. Kim Il-sung. And next to him is a dancer, Retno Maruti. You have traveled all over the world. - Yes. - The two of you may be together This one. Walt Disney, America. Who are they? They are from the previous picture. This is the picture of... I probably... - This is the last maestro. - ...will never... I learned from Master I Mario. I probably will never get the chance... to teach my child how to dance. Come on, come here, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, friends Come on, come here, hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, lover I left 43 years ago. But at the time, I didn't realize why I left. Perhaps it was because of the blood. Because everywhere, there was blood. Blood. Back then, everyone talked about justice, humanity, and prosperity. But it all ended up with bloodshed over and over again. Why do you keep talking about blood? They go on about blood all the time on TV. Besides, I don't understand history. I got bad grades in history. Anyway, I don't care. You can't go. I need you. If you go, I won't know what to do. You don't know yet who I am. I came home last year and found out everyone thought I'd died. They'd performed the "aben" cremation, the ceremony for me. The man here, the man that you see now, is the man that you can see. But there's also me that you can't see, the one who died. See what I mean? - How to put it... - You're alive now. I'm holding you. I'm holding your hand now. Yes, yes, yes. It's hard to explain this to you. I'm leaving now. If you want to come, that's okay. Go ahead. If you don't, that's fine too. Where are you going? Sir! Where are you going? Come on. Stop following me. Just worry about yourself. Do you know that you're making no sense to me? Think about your future. Have pity on your parents. You don't have to worry about my future. My father's money will last for at least seven generations. If I want to be an artist, I just pay. If I want to be a poet, I just perform. Yes, yes, yes. Where are you going? Don't leave me! Sir! Sir! Please give some comments. Last night, the Commission for Eradicating Corruption, the KPK, arrested Teguh Priatna for alleged corruption. He is the father of the talented young artist, Nian Priatna. Until now, Teguh Priatna refuses to give any statement about his case. - Sir. - Please move over. My dad has no head! Has no heart! Has no hands! I often felt abandoned when I was small. I really wanted to be a dancer on stage. But they wouldn't let me. They said I was too fat. That my skin was too dark. So I peeped at the dancing lessons of people who learned dancing. And then I went to my room and rehearsed in front of the mirror. I always wanted to be taken on a motorcycle to be picked up for a performance. You're lucky. You knew what was going on. But I don't know what's going on. Shall we go? - I'm leaving. Excuse me. - All right. Kaler, take these bananas to Mom. - I can't do it now. I'm overloaded. - She wants the bananas now. I'm overloaded. I'll do it tomorrow, okay? Kaler, they've been bought already. Let me carry them. Can you do it? - I can. Let me carry them. - Okay. You carry them then. You got it? - I got it. - You'd better get on this side. You got confused. And you have to carry the bananas. - I can't sit like that. - Yeah. - We're leaving. - Bye. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. You can eat it, Tumang. Kaler didn't want it. Sorry, I haven't fixed the roof. - It's all right. - And now it's all wet. Everything is wet. I'm sorry, it's all wet. It was raining and the roof is leaking. You can wear this. Thanks. - I will fix the roof later. - Okay. Whose dress is this? - My mother's. - Why? So you can peep? You're like my mother. You're like my mother. - Rani. - Yes. I want to tell you that your mother didn't sell you. She had you fostered because she loved you. - Don't say that again. - And I love you too. You said you loved me. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of hearing parents say they love their children. Rani, your mother was only a dancer. You lied to me. She had no money. And only now you tell me? - Rani, you should understand... - Enough. Why did you say I was like your mother? Why? My mother always forbade me. From doing what? From doing what? From loving her. She wouldn't let me help her put on her costume for the dance. If I wasn't diligent, she wouldn't let me help her with the costume. This is clean already. There's a dance costume in the bedroom. It must have been your mother's. I want you to help me wear it. My birth mother was a dancer too. Take the chicken. It's okay.

Why are you just standing there? Why won't you move aside? I will walk. - You think you can do it? - Yes, it's okay. Why are you angry? The alley is wide. There's room to get past. I'm tired of moving aside. "Please move aside. I want to get past." Have you ever thought about how I feel? I've always waited while you did what you wanted. I've only ever had bad luck. Have you ever taken me out? You only ask pretty dancers to go out with you. Look. We're on the street. It will be embarrassing if people see this. Shut up! I'm fed up. We'll do it this way. Give me a ride. Start the motorcycle. How much is this? Three thousand. Excuse me, ma'am. Where are you from? - What do you mean? - Where are you from? If you don't mind, tell me your full name. Thank you. Ma'am. - Don't be rude! Don't touch me! - I asked where you were from. - I have nothing to do with the police. - Wait. You are playing the hero, right? These mothers need money for their babies. Don't try to report this to the police! Golden flowers that have bloomed Great flowers in the ninth sky Golden flowers that have bloomed Golden flowers that have bloomed Great flowers in the ninth sky Falling to the west Falling to the east Showing their faces I just want to know if my mother loved me. - What do you think? - You're always complaining! I'm fed up with hearing your grievances! I'm tired of it. This is important. Come in! - What is it? I will shout! - Listen to me. I'm afraid they'll find out and send me home to Java. I have no money. - I'm five months pregnant. - Right. - Please give me money. - Please don't tell the police. How can we feed our children? What's her offense? Don't know. She hasn't been charged. - Yesterday's case? - Can you handle it? I'm busy. So much work. What's her offense? - I don't know. - Be quiet. Don't interfere. - Just put this woman under arrest. - Yes. Just get a remand warrant issued. She's allegedly involved in baby trafficking. So, who is it for the first case? Officer! Why am I here? What do you think? - Temper. - Don't get angry in a police station. But I've been here a long time and you're just ignoring me! Don't get angry here. Take it easy. There are many problems. - Just take it slow. - Here. My colleague will deal with you. I have other things to do. He's good at dealing with women. Why must you be mad? I've done nothing, but you brought me here! Why? And you just ignored me! - Why were you in Soka's house? - I don't know anything! You've been in Bali for quite some time. - I don't know. - At least you know those people. That's what we need to know. - You said you knew that bald man. - No! I don't know him! Then when you met with him, you didn't mind? I want to call my mom! I will call your mom. I will let her know. I can call your mom. Don't. Please sit down. I want to call my mom! If you can't help, let me see your superior! Why are you silent, ma'am? How long have you had the bamboo weaving business? Quite long. - How long have you run the business? - Ten years. What are the pregnant women doing in your house? What are their jobs? They come for jobs in bamboo weaving. So you collect pregnant women in your house? No. No. It just happens that some of them are pregnant. Are their husbands there? No husbands? You accommodate them, right? I took pity on them. We've found baby clothing. Who does it belong to? Someone must have given it to one of the pregnant women. - How many of them are pregnant? - Five. You've been accommodating pregnant women for ten years? No. When they've had their babies, they work for one more year and then leave. What happens to the babies? Their relatives take care of them. Really? Or are they sold? - No babies are sold. - We had a tip-off you sell babies? - What if we get proof? - Soka is innocent. - She doesn't sell babies. She only helps. - You're lying! - All these excuses about health. - Sir... The baby trader pays with TVs, vitamins. Your excuse is it covers this and that. You must know that the babies are bought while they're still in the womb. How are you related to this woman? I am her future husband. Have you been engaged long? Yes, Officer. Like the moon Reflected in clear water In a large earthenware jar In transparency We see The meaning Of creation When meditation Is practiced The mediator Reflects creation God and goddess... When your mom was still around, she taught you how to put a flower behind my ear. And that's my happiness. After your mom was gone, I thought that money could make me feel secure about my future. Now, I'm in jail. And money can't replace the way your mom taught you to put a flower behind my ear.
