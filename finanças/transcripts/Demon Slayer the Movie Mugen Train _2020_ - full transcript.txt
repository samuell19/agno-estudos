Yaichi. Toyoyaki. Issao. Ryosuke. Yukio. Kaikaido. Master Ubuyashiki, it's time to return. Your body will be overwhelmed. I donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt know how manytimes I've come back to this cemetary. All the regrets of these young people. I hope it ends before I am gone. Just this month reports of casualties caused by demons have already increased sevenfold. My children of the Demon Slayer Corp. Now, this time are leading the charge against the demons. No matter how many precious lives the demons take. A strong will can never be taken. No matter how big a hit they will still stand up and fight again. Alright, let's hide our swords and get on the train. Oh no!The train is leaving! Are the police gone? Even if they're still here,we still have to get on the train. Haha! A showdown! Owner of the land! That fool! Let's go! Don't leave me behind! Wait! Wait for me! Tanjiro! Inosuke! Zenitsu! So fast! Sorry, sorry. Stop messing around!Get over here, idiot! Hey! Granny, is this okay? Thank you for your help. sorry for the inconvenience... What? Don't worry about it! The Hashira is here, right? The guy who's supposed to meet up with us. Do you know what he looks like? He has a wild hair I remember his smell. I think I spotted him earlier. Demon Slayer: Infinity Train Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! That person is a Hashira? Tasty! He's definitely not an ordinary person... Tasty! Tasty! um... excuse me. Tasty! Mr. Rengoku Tasty! uh... Yes, I totally get that. You were the one who was with Master Ubuyashiki. Yes. I'm Kamado Tanjiro. These guys are also Demon Slayers. They are my friends. this is Zenitsu and the guynext to him is called Inosuke! Is that so. That said, the demon in that box is... Yes, it's my sister, Nezuko. That demon displayed something that was approved by the Master. We're in this together. Come, take a seat. Amazing! The OwnerÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs stomach is so amazing! Stop, you're going to break the glass! Please try to be safe! Why are you on this train? Do you have a mission? We received the order from the crow. We were told that the casualties of the Infinite Train continues to increase. And were ordered here. To meet up with you as soon as possible. So, it turned out to be this way. Got it! Yes. I wanted to ask one more thing... I wanted to ask you myself. What's the matter?Tell me. It's about my father. What about him? He was always weak and sick. Weak and sick? Even so... in snow, cold enough to freeze the lungs... he would perform the Kagura dance all night. That's impressive! And so- What is it! The Dance of the Fire God. In a life and death situation. I remembered the Kagura dance I saw as a kid. If you know anything about this I hoped you could tell me. I don't know anything! ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs the first time I've even heard of the Dance of the Fire God. This Dance performed by your father can be used in combat. That is very good. It seems that this topic has been discussed. Sorry, could you please say more? Become my disciple! I will take good care of you! Please wait! Where are you looking at?Who are you talking to? What a weird person... Flame Breathing has a long history. Flame and Water swordsmen regardless of the erahave been among the Hashira. Flame. Water. Wind. Stone. Thunder. These are the primary breathing forms. All other forms come from their branches. For example, Mist is derived from Wind. Novice swordsman what color is your sword? My name's Kamado! My sword is black. Black sword. This is a big deal! Is it really bad? I have never heard of someone witha black sword becoming a Hashira. To this dayno one has heard of such a thing. Which form will you specialize in? You could learn from me! You will not be disappointed! That's not what I meant! And where are you looking at?Who are you talking to? He's weird but he's also a good person who takes care of others. From his smell he has a strong sense of justice. This is great! So fast! That's dangerous, you fool! I want to go outside and run beside it! Let's see who runs faster! There has to be a limit to your stupidity! We are in a dangerous situation. We don't know when the demons will appear. Is that true? Are demons really appearing on this train? They have. They really have? I don't want to be on a train with demons! There are demons here! Ahhh! I want to get off! Within a short time on this train more than forty people have gone missing. Many swordsmen have been sent to this train but every one of them has gone missing. As a Hashira, I have been called to investigate. Why is it always like this! I want to get off!Let me off! Please present your ticket. What is he doing? The conductor wants to confirm your ticket is genuine. He will make a mark on your ticket. Here it is... What happened? There's a disgusting smell... Thank you... I confirmed... Conductor. It is dangerous here, please evacuate the area. The situation is very urgent. Please do not mind that I brought a sword. You were using the Blood Arts to hide this huge body? No wonder it was hard to detect you. But since you seek to kill innocent people this flaming sword in my hands will destroy you. Flame Breathing!First Form! Unknowing Fire! Incredible! He took care of that demon like it was nothing! There is another demon here. Here I come! Don't leave me! I won't allow you to harm that human. Didn't you hear what I just said? Your opponent is right here. What the hell is that? His hands are long?His hands are really long! Look at me!I'm going first! Wait a minute, there are still people who haven't escaped! Just gotta kill the demon and everything's okay! The carriage behind us is safe. Go. Now there are no problems. Let's end this quickly. Flame Breathing!Second Form! Rising Scorching Sun! Too... He's so strong! Superb swordsmanship! Please make me your apprentice! Of course, no problem! I'll train you to become a great swordsman! Me too!! Okay, I'll look after all three of you! Our Rengoku Aniki! Aniki! Rengoku Aniki! I did as you ordered! I cut the ticket and let them fall asleep! Please! Let me go to sleep! Please let me meet my dead family! Please! Please... Okay. You've done very well... Fall asleep... Have a dream of meeting your family. Your Grace... what should we do? Wait a while, they will fall asleep. Wait here before that. These are intelligent demon slayers. Sometimes when a person with murderous intent draws close they will wake up again unconsciously. When you get close enough to tie the rope be careful not to touch them. As to no alarm them. I can't leave the front carriage. Before I am ready perform your duties well. All that matters is to dream of happiness. Yes. What happened... what is going on? Calm down, calm down. You must be calm. It's nii-chan! Nii-shan, you're back! Did you sell all of the charcoal? Nii-chan? I'm sorry!I'm so sorry! To die in a sweet dream... what a wonderful thing. Even if it is a powerful demon slayer there are no exceptions. The driving force of mankind is the mind... ...and the spirit. Just destroy the spiritual core and everything is done. They are so easy to kill the spiritual core is the same no matter who it is. They are all so fragile like glass. The rope should be tied to the wrist. Is this the right way? Yes. Don't forget what he told us. Breathe slowly. Count in your heart. You can fall into a deep sleep by doing this. One, two, three, four... Then, nii-chan burst into tears! It shocked me! He's so strange! Maybe it's because he's too tired. No need to make a fuss. I'm fine. Are you feeling alright? Don't push yourself. Rest at home today. I'm really fine. Are you really okay? Would you like to make a dumpling? Stop playing around! Really? If you don't like it just say so! I feel like I was having a nightmare. Go to sleep, sleep quietly. Forget everything, sleep quietly. Even if a demon comes, sleep quietly. Sleep quietly even in your heart. They seem very happy. They should all be having pleasant dreams. Fall gently. Fall gently. Fall into a dream. Fall into a deep sleep. Because can't wake up anymore. Come here! The peaches here are delicious. They're blooming with white clover flowers. I will make a beautiful wreath for you. I really know how to make wreaths. How about it, Nezuko? I'd like to make a lot of them! Zenitsu! There's a small river halfway but don't worry, it's very shallow! Small river? Zenitsu, I don't know... I was never taught how to swim. It's okay!Just hop on my back and we'll both cross! It's just a small river! I won't allow any water to get on Nezuko! Leave everything to me! Leave everything to me! Just leave it to me! Look at me! Expedition team!Cave expedition team! We are the cave expedition team! Scouting team! Boss! What's the matter? Tell me, what did you find? (Tanjiro)There is a very strong smell of the cave owner! Bump! (Zenitsu)I also heard him screaming, "Choo!" Really? In this place? Okay, let's go to battle! Obey, boss! What are you doing? Don't stay behind, fight together! Come here! Look!I give you bright acorns! Do you see? Attack! What am I here for? That's right. I came to tell my father that I've become a Hashira. You became a Hashira. So what? A worthless title. Nonsensical. Anyway, neither you nor I will ever amount to anything great. Older brother! Is Father happy for you? If I become like you will Father also recognize me? He didn't used to be like that. Father used to be a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corp. He was originally a passionate person. Then one day, he suddenly gave up. Suddenly. The one who did his best who was passionate and nurtured us. Why? Don't think about things that you can't change. I still feel sorry for Senjuro. Our mother died of illness Mother who he has no memory of. There's nothing he can do about that. To be honest with you, Father is not happy for me. He doesn't care about my accomplishment. However, your older brother will not lose his enthusiasm because of this. The flame in my heart won't go out! I won't be discouraged! Senjuro, you are different from me. You have your older brother. And he believes in his younger brother. No matter which way you go, you'll become a great person! Have a burning passion in your heart! You have to work hard to live! Don't lose faith! Ah, this is good. Those ropes I made allow the person tied to it to invade their dreams. It's a special technique. In every circumstance I face the enemy very carefully. Just fall asleep. Whether they are great or insignificant they will be like infants. A delicious meal to taste slowly. I just have to wait for those demon slayers to be dealt with... No need to swing the sword so rigidly. Relax your shoulders. Like this? Yes. It's dangerous over there, that's the master of the body. I have to be careful not to be found by him. Find the boundary of the dream. Faster! The dreams I make are not endless but centered on the dreamer. A circle appears around the master of the body. Beyond the dream is a special field without consciousness. The spiritual core is hidden there. Your job is to destroy the core. In this way, the owner of the dream will begin to deteriorate. Found it! Although the scenery continues... I can't move forward. I must quickly destroy the spiritual core of this person. If I do this I can also have a happy dream. What a strange unconscious realm. it's so hot. It's actually burning. Have to hurry. I found it! Is this the spiritual core? This is my first time seeing it. I just have to destroy it... ...then I can! People who fall into the sleep spell shouldn't be able to move at all! How is this possible? What an amazing survival instinct! Tanjiro. Today, Mother is going to make your favorite food. I'm sure you'll like it! Wait, I'll mash the leftover mochi right away. Awesome! Mother wants to bake senbei! Not fair! I also like senbei! We're brothers, you know? I would also like some senbei! Me too! So let's eat together! Can you help your mother get the cooking net? Yes!Yes!Yes! I will mash the mochi with a grinder! Oh, I'll help to mash it up! I also want to help! You're gonna be held responsible for eating that later! What a thief! Nezuko, let's go. What did I just say? I'm back! Welcome back. I'm back. Welcome back, nii-chan. Huh, where is Nezuko? Nee-chan just went to the mountain to pick wild vegetables. It's daytime! Is that not okay? Is that... Strange. Tanjirou, can you heat the bath water for me? The kitchen is still busy for now. I'm saying strange things. Is it because I'm tired? Strange, it disappeared. What happened just now? I seemed to have... seen a box? An illusion caused by the snow? Wake up! Wake up! Wake up now, everyone is under attack! It's a dream, this is just a dream! Wake up now! That's it! Yeah, I'm... I should be on the train! Wake up and fight! Hurry up and fight! Fight right away! Onii-chan, can you give me your pickled radish? Just say no! You can't do this every time! Why are you always like this! Grabbing something from nii-chan! You're annoying! You already have another bowl of rice! I didn't wake up. I didn't wake up! I'm still in the dream! What do I have to do to leave? I just figured out this is a dream! What do I do? I have to wake up! Onii-chan! You're on fire! It's the smell of Nezuko. Nezuko is bleeding! My demon slayer uniform. I'm aware now. Waking up little by little. What happened? Nii-chan, are you okay? Onii-chan? Sorry... I have to go. I can't come back. I'm so sorry. Onii-chan! Nii-chan! If the demon that made me dream is nearby I have to find him as soon as possible and get rid of him. Where is he... quick! Onii-chan, where are you going? I picked a lot of wild vegetables on the mountain today. Mother, over here! Onii-chan suddenly caught on fire! Mother? Tanjiro, are you okay? Onii-chan... What's wrong, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that? I want to stay here forever. I want to turn around and go back. If this was real I would live with everyone like this. On this mountain. If this was real Everyone would be alive and well. Nezuko would walk in the sunlight and under the clear sky. If this was real I would be burning charcoal as usual. and wouldn't be swinging a katana. If this was real... But I have lost them. It's impossible to go back. Onii-chan, don't leave us! Sorry! Sorry, Rokuta! I can't stay with you any longer! But your big brother is always thinking of you! I'm always thinking of everyone! I am very grateful. And I am very sorry. I won't forget you! No matter what, my heart is always with you! So please... Please forgive me! I must quickly destroy his spiritual core. His subconscious realm. How can it be so beautiful? This vast expanse? So warm... Where is the spiritual core? This subconsciousness... What exactly is going on? Speaking of which, that crazy boar makes me feel sick. What's wrong with him? What is he doing here? This gross half-naked boar! Dark... It's so dark you can't see anything. How annoying. The unconsciousness of this blonde kid. It's too ridiculous. I'll have to use my hands to find where the spiritual core is? What a joke. Huh...? Why would a disgusting man come here? What a damn pest. The only one who can come here is Nezuko! I am going to kill you. Where is Nezuko? How would I know? So... Die! Die! Nooooo!! Is someone in trouble? What happened? How have they connected and their spiritual cores not been destroyed yet? Ah well... that's fine. They've given me enough time. Not here. Although, there is a very faint strange smell. What is this feeling? As if I'm covered with a film? The faint smell of a demon coming from all sides. But there is no way to determine the location. I have to get out as soon as possible! Nezuko is bleeding. If everyone else fell asleep too it means the situation is very bad. What to do? Could it be... I'm not using Total Concentration Breathing? Am I just asleep now? Tanjiro. Draw your blade. There is something you must cut. Something I must cut... In order to wake up What do i have to cut? I think I know. But... what if I'm wrong? If events in my dream influence reality... It will be irreparable Do not hesitate. Hands on! Just do it! Death in dreams can be connected to sobriety in reality! In other words I must do this! Cut... your neck! I'm fine, I'm still alive. Nezuko, are you okay? Nezuko. Zenitsu. Inosuke. Rengoku. Who are these people? Tied to our wrists with a rope? Rope. How is this... The rope was burned. Did Nezuko burn the rope? There's a faint smell of a demon. Is this smell also on the ticket? As I thought. There is also the faint smell of a demon on it. I must have been hypnotized when the ticket was cut. This ticket was touched by a demon. Such a subtle smell. What could perform such Blood Arts technique? What has happened here? I think it's best to not use a sword for this. To burn this rope. Nezuko, please. Help everyone by burning the ropes! Zenitsu, wake up! Wake up, Zenitsu! Wake up quickly! Wake up quickly, Inosuke, please! Inosuke! Great job. I'm sorry. Thank you. Nezuko you're doing very well. They still can't wake up. What do I do? Rengo- What- Is this girl controlled by a demon? Don't try to stop me! It's your fault for coming! Stopping me from having a good dream! She is voluntarily... Him too. Why are you still in a daze? If you're awake, hurry up and help! I don't care if you're sick or whatever! If you don't do things well I'm going to tell that- Tell him not to let you dream! Did you hear me? Was he the one tied to me? Tuberculosis. He's sick. Really bad, too. I can't forgive this demon. Controlling people like this. Sorry. I must leave you right now. You wanted to stay in a happy dream, I know. I know. I also wanted to stay in my dream. Even if it was a dream. I thought as long as I could escape the pain of my illness it doesn't matter if I hurt others. But in your subconsiousness it was so warm. You should be the embodiment of this person's soul. It is very clear and transparent, it feels so comfortable. This is the spiritual core? Why bring me here? You know I'm looking for this? Did you bring me here? How could this be? I'm here to destroy the spiritual core. Why? Those shining souls in your heart. Illuminated my painful and twisted heart. Are you okay? Thank you. You must be careful. Right. Nezuko! Such a strong smell. So heavy. In such a strong wind, the smell of this demon is still so strong. How could I fall asleep in here. It's so strong even in this confined space. I can't believe it I'm so useless. The demon is upwind. Is he in the front carriage? Nezuko, don't follow me! It's dangerous outside, stay inside! Wake everyone up! Oh, you woke up. Good morning! If only you stayed asleep. Is it this guy...? Why wake up? I made you have such a wonderful dream. If I feel like it I could also make you dreamof your family being murdered. Do you prefer to have that kind of dream? I don't think so, it's too painful. Actually, I changed I mind. I will let you have it. Your dreamof your family coming back to life is over. I... like to make people have pleasant dreams followed by a nightmare. I like to see human beings in pain. Their distorted expressions. I can't stop. Seeing those crushed by misfortune. Innocent people struggling with pain. It's so fascinating. However, I won't be careless. Even if it takes a little more work I will definitely kill you demon slayers. The ink of those tickets were mixed with my blood. As long as the conductor is checking cuts the ticket and leaves a gap it will automatically start the process. But it's weird. Why did this one wake up? He saw through the technique in such a short time. Don't you want pleasant dreams? To have good dreams. Human desire in this aspect is obviously very strong. Don't thoughtlessly trample your way into peoples's dreams! I won't forgive you! He's wearing earrings? I am blessed with good fortune! He was delivered to me so soon! Like in a dream. Soon I can have more... more of the blood bestowed by Master Muzan! Then after I become stronger I can request to take part in the battle to replace a Upper Moon! Water Breathing! Tenth Form! Constant Flux! Blood Arts! Compelling Hypnotic Whisper! Go to sleep. He's not asleep? Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Go to sleep! How could this be? Are my Blood Arts not effective? No, this one has undergone my hypnosis many times. The moment he was hypnotized I could see my Blood Arts were effective. Killing yourself to stay awake. Although in a dream doing such a thing For one to kill oneself requires a lot of courage. This kid he is not an ordinary person. Why our brother did not come to save us? When our family was killed What were you doing? Only you survived. Why are you even here? You're useless. You should've just died. How dare you live so cheerfully? My family would never say such things! Don't mess with me! You are not allowed insult them! There's practically no reaction. Could this be a dream too? Or is this demon just weaker than him? Master said, "Kill the Pillar and the one who wearshanafuda earrings." Master's mood at that time... I understand it very well now! I feel like your very existence Somehow Makes me twitch in anger! He's not dying!? Your expression is lovely! I wanted to see that face of yours. "I clearly cut off his head, why can't he die?" You want me to give you a reason. Fine. Since I'm feeling great. I'm in a very good mood. The reason why is so simple even a baby could understand. My original body is long gone. Long gone. This body that is talking to you, although it has the shape of a head it is not the real head. While you were lying down and sleeping I merged with this train! Everything about this train has become my body! My meat! My bones! Look at your face. Did you understand? In other words The two hundred passengers on this train Will all become food that will strengthen my body. They are all my hostages. Can you protect them? You are alone. This train runs from front to back. So many innocent passengers. How would you feel handing them all over to me? What should I do, What should I do!! I can only protect passengers in two carriages at most. I can't guarantee everyone's safety! Mr. Rengoku, Zenitsu, Inosuke! Stop sleeping! Please wake up, please! Nezuko! You have to protect those who are asleep! Men, come with me! Look at me!Explosive awakening! Comin' through, Lord Inosuke is here! The boar is advancing by leaps and bounds, Lord Inosuke is here! Inosuke! No place on this train is safe! We need to protect those who fell asleep! The whole train has completely turned into a demon! Did you hear that? This whole train is a demon! I knew it. Exactly as I expected. I am very wise! and I lack nothing as a boss! Beast Breathing! Fifth Fang! Crazy Cutting! Whether it's this guy or that guy I will save them all! You'll all have a chance! To worship me! Your Lord, your Lord Lord Inosuke! Comin' through! I have to save the passengers too. Since Inosuke is here now I'll go ahead. Things have come this. Water Breathing! First Form! Surface Slash! No effect. The demon's body goes on endlessly. I have to stop it. The feeling of demon slayers running around in my own body. I will regenerate immediately. It won't stop until you are exhausted. My body slowly... ...approaches hundreds of passengers to devour them.! Thunder Breathing!First Form! Thunderclap and Flash! Sixfold. Nezuko, I will protect you. Protect... Was that thunder I heard? Is it in the back carriages? What is the situation of the front? Is Rengoku awake? Where are you Rengoku, where are you Nezuko? It's useless not knowing where they are. This is bad. What should I do? We need everyone working together! The passengers in the last car should be fine, right? Damn it, It's too cramped! I can't swing my katana properly! I took a nap and look what happened. I can't believe it! Some Hashira I am... If there were a hole I'd hide in it!! What was that? What happened just now? Was that the demon? Novice swordsman! Mr. Rengoku! Before coming here I used a flurry of attacks against the demon. It will take some time for the demon to regenerate. There's not much time, so I will make it short. Yes. The train has eight carriages. I'll protect the back five! The remaining three sections are protected by the yellow-haired boy and your sister. You and the boar-head boy Keep an eye on those three wagons compartments. Find the demon's neck. Neck? But this demon is already- No matter what shape it becomes As long as he is a demon, he has a neck! I will fight while looking for his vitals. You have to cheer up! He's so powerful. That was just now... The shaking was caused by Rengoku when he moved? The situation was so quickly grasped and judged. One person, responsible for five carriages. Now is not the time to admire him, idiot! Hurry up and do what must be done! The smell is getting stronger and stronger! I have to hurry! Inosuke! Inosuke, where are you? So noisy! Shut up or I'll kill you! Above me? Mr. Big Eyes trying to order me around! But he seems... ...he seems ...seems very powerful! Infuriating! Inosuke! We have to pay attention to the three cars ahead! I know! And I've already found it! Found it long ago! Relying on myself! I found the Owner's neck! You found it? The neck is really ahead? Yes, just ahead! It's here in the front! The strong wind dispersed the smell. And made it hard to tell. Since Inosuke said so, I believe him! Near the coal pile! Right! Got it! Fine, let's go! Go ahead! Right here? Great! Inosuke! Suspicious. Especially near where- What do you want to do? G-g-get out! The demon's neck. Demon. Demon's vital spot! What in the- What the- So many hands! This is bad! Water Breathing!Fourth Form! Striking Tide! Inosuke, are you okay? I was not saved just because of you. I know that. This... Directly below... Directly below here. The smell is very strong. Inosuke, the demon's neck is under us! Don't order me around! I'm the boss! Okay, fine! Watch closely. Beast Breathing!Second Fang! Rip and Tear! Is the bone...? Is that the bones of the neck? Water Breathing!Eighth Form! Waterfall Basin! Blocked? The incision healed quickly. He regenerates quickly. And trying my best I barely reached his bones. You have to cut it off. Inosuke! We're going to continuously attackwith our breathing forms! One person cuts the meat forward first. The other cuts off the bone immediately after. This could work. Your method sounds like it will work,I'll make sure to praise you for this! Thank you! Let's start. Forced Unconscious Sleep... Eyes! Blood Demon Art! I'm going to fall asleep. Inosuke, cut your neck in his dream so you can wake up! Nothing? If you beat him with that trick, you can beat his spell! Stupid!Close your eyes immediately after you wake up! Otherwise, you'll go back to where you started. Good, I woke up. The moment I wake up my eyes always meet one of the demon's eyes! I need to wake up with my eyes closed! With my eyes closed... Not fast enough! Faster! Even faster! Cut the neck! Cut... Faster! Wake up! Wake up! This is no dream! It's reality! Don't fall into that trap! Don't die a fool's death! I wear the hide of the lord of the mountain. They're so scared! They don't dare to look into my eyes! You puny eye-ball thing!! He's right. Where is Inosuke looking? It's hard to tell. Anyways, I just need to chop this guy's head off. Inosuke! You won't stop me from dreaming! Did he stab you? I'm fine. Why bother with that bastard? No, we can't let him die. Hurry up and cut off the demon's neck! We can't hold out for much longer! I know. Move fast. Inosuke. Breathe well. We'll cut off the demon's neck together. Keep attacking. This is bad. If I fall asleep now. goddammit! I'm going to rush him, watch my back! Beast Breathing!Third Fang! Devour! Please bless me. Dad, please bless me. Let me chop off the bones with one blow. Let me chop off the bones with one blow! Dance of the Fire God! Clear Blue Sky! What a scream, everything is shaking! It's going to roll over, Inosuke! Wait, is your stomach okay? Inosuke, protect passengers- I can't die. If i die, that person will become a murderer. I can't die. I don't want anyone to die. Are you okay? Santaro? Hang in there! This demon's flesh was elastic and became a meat pad. And that saved me! How is your stomach? Is the stabbed belly okay? I'm.. Fine. How about you Inosuke? I'm feel great, not even a sniffle! I can't move yet. Hurry up and help the others. I wonder if anyone was injured? Near the demon's neck... where is the driver? I actually think it's all right if he dies! No, it is not. He's the one who stabbed you in the stomach! That guy's foot was pinched by the train, he can't move at all. His feet are squashed and he can't move at all. Leave it alone. In this case he has been punished enough. Hurry and help him. Please. I'm going. Because I'm a good boss. I'll do it to make my underling happy. But after I help him. I'm ripping out all his hair. You don't have to do that. It looks like dawn is coming. I need to adjust my breathing. I have to help the injured. Nezuko, Zenitsu, Mr. Rengoku. They've got to be safe. My body is disintegrating, I can't regenerate. Did I lose? Am I going to die? Me? How is this possible...? I never got to use my full strength! I haven't even eaten a human. Integrating with the train. An excellent plan to devour a large number of humans at once. All for nothing! I am like this now, I spent so much effort and time... It's his fault! It's that guy's fault! I took hundreds of hostages but... he still cornered, and pinned me down. Is this the power of a Hashira? That kid. He was moving too fast. ...Even without undoing my technique! And that girl. Isn't she a demon? What's up with that!? How can a demon partner with a demon slayer!? Why hasn't lord muzan killed her? Damn it! However... It all started to go wrong when that brat... ...when he broke my spell! It's that kid's fault. Still... even if you could kill that kid. There's also that boar. If there was only that kid, I would have killed him. I blame the boar. His instinct is so sensitive. He is really sensitive to sight. Am I going to lose? Am I going to die? This is a nightmare, it must be a nightmare! Killed by the demon slayers. I'm always at the bottom of the barrel. When I think about it this century has been dominated by the same demons. Who have defeated countless Hashiras in the Demon Slayer Corps. Are these the opponents of the Upper Moons? Is the strength of the Upper Moonsfrom a different dimension? I accumulated so much blood, and yet, I was still so far behind. I really want to start all over. How could there be such a miserable nightmare. It seems that you can do total concentration breathing. Admirable. Mr. Rengoku. Learning it is the first step to becoming a Hashira. But before becoming one, you may have ten thousand steps to go. I'll do my best. Your abdomen is bleeding heavily. Concentrate more. Improve the accuracy of your breathing. Focus on every inch of your body. There are blood vessels. Repair the broken blood vessels. Concentrate more. Right there. Stop the internal bleeding, stop it quickly. Focus. The bleeding has stopped. As long as you can master the breathing methods you can do things ordinary people can't do. Although not everything can be done. But it does make you stronger than you were yesterday. I understand. Everyone is safe. Although there are many injured, none of their injuries are life-threatening. You don't need to overdo it, take a good rest. Thank you very much. Upper Moon... 3? What is he doing here?! Flame Breathing!Second Form! Rising Scorching Sun! Nice katana. Fast regeneration... and an overwhelming demon aura. So this is a Upper Moon. I can not understand why you chose to attack the wounded first? I thought he might interrupt the conversation... ...we're about to have. What are we going to talk about? Although this is our first time meeting I already hate you. Is that so? I also hate weak humans. When i see weakness, my skin crawls. It looks like you and me have completely different standards and values. Let me give you a wonderful proposal. Why don't you become a demon? Of course not. I can tell by looking... ...your strength. You're a Hashira, right? You've developed your fighting spirit... ...to the edge of perfection. I am the Flame of the Nine Pillars. My name is Kyojuro Rengoku. I am Akaza. Kyojuro, let me tell you why your power... ...will never truly reach perfection. It's because you're human. Because you will grow old, because you will die. Become a demon, Kyojuro. In this way whether it's a hundred years or two hundred years you can keep improving, you can become stronger. Among all the demons I have encountered so far his smell is closest to Kibutsuji Muzan. I have to get up. Growing old and dying... Is what makes a short-lived creature like a human... ...beautiful. It's precisely because we age and die... that our lives have value and nobility. Strength is not a word that only applies to the physical. This boy isn't weak. Do not insult him. I'll say it again. You and I value different things. No matter how many reasons you give me I will not become a demon. Is that so? Technique Development! Destructive Kill: Compass Needle! If you won't become a demon, then I'll have to kill you. I can't follow their movements. Among the Hashira I have killed no one had Flames. And no one accepted my proposal. My invitation! Why would you deny the invitation? As someone who also walks the path of the warrior. I really can't understand. Only those who are selected can become demons. Looking at people's magnificent talent. Becoming ugly with age. I can't stand it. Just die, Kyojuro. While you are young and strong. Destructive Kill: Air! That's it. Flame Breathing! Fourth Form! Blooming Flame Undulation! He strikes the empty air with his fists. But the attack... ...comes directly at me! If we fight at a distance like this... It will be tough to cut off his head. In that case. I'll get close! Such amazing speed. Such superb swordsmanship will disappear from the world! Kyojuro!Don't you feel sad? It won't be sad because it is natural for humans to die! Do not move! If the wound opens, you'll die! Stay there on standby! Don't care for the weak, Kyojuro! Use your utmost ability! Concentrate your eyes on me. You was a good move! Mr. Rengoku! Mr. Big Eyes! Become a demon, Kyojuro. that way, you and me can fight forever. To improve our abilities. You have the qualifications to fight with me. I reject your offer. Ask me again, I dare you. I will never be a demon. Flame Breathing! Third Form! Fiery Spirits! That's great! Keep going! Destructive Kill: Air! There's no opening, I can't get in. It's so fast that I can't keep up. It's like they're in another dimension. If I break in... there's no way I'd survive! Even if I wanted to help I'll only get in the way. So I can't move at all! Mr. Rengoku. Haven't you figured it out yet? If you keep fighting me You will only forward your own death. Kyojuro! Flame Breathing!First Form! Unknowing Fire! What a pity to kill you here! You haven't even reached your peak! Second Form! Rising Scorching Sun! One or two years from now your moves would be more refined their lethality would also increase. Third Form!Fiery Spirits! Fourth Form!Blooming Flame Undulation! Destructive Kill! Fifth Form!Flame Tiger! Disorder! Kyojuro! Did it succeed? Did you beat him? No way... How could this be? Keep fighting with me. Don't die, Kyojuro. Mr. Rengoku. Mr. Rengoku! Even if you fight with the determination to sacrifice yourself. Everything is in vain, Kyojuro. That superb slash you inflicted. No matter how fierce. The wound will heal in an instant. But look at yourself. Your left eye crushed, your ribs are broken. Internal organs are also damaged. Usually those injuries are impossible to recover from. But if you are a demon those injuries can be recovered at a glance. To a demon, those are just scratches. No matter how hard you struggle humans cannot defeat demons. I really want to help. My hands and feet just won't move. This condition is not exclusively from my injuries. after using the Dance of the Fire God, I will be like this. Kyojuro, you... I will... I will fulfill my duty well. Everyone who is here! I won't let anyone die! In an instant. I'll slash a broad area! Flame Breathing! Ninth Form! Magnificent strength! Even with those wounds... You're full of determination and resolve! Such fighting spirit! Your stance has no weakness. You really should becoma a demon, Kyojuro! Let us fight each other forever! Burn! Burn beyond your limits! I am the Pillar of Flame! Rengoku Kyojuro! Ninth Form! Rengoku! Destructive Kill: Annihilation! Rengoku! Mr. Rengoku! Mr. Rengoku! I can't see... Rengoku! You will die! You will really die, Kyojuro! Become a demon! Say you are going to be a demon! You are one of the chosen strong ones! Kyojuro. Yes, Mother. Think carefully about Mother's next question. Do you know why you were born stronger than others? I don't know! To help those weaker than you. You were born blessed. Someone who has more talent than others. That strength must be used selflessly. Make good use of it for others. To take advantage of the strength granted by Heaven and use it to hurt others is unforgivable! Help the weak.Anytime, anywhere. It's your duty to be strong. You must take responsibility. That is your duty to be carried out. You must not forget this. Got it! I'm afraid I don't have much time left. To be the mother of such a strong and kind child makes me very happy. I'm counting on you. Mother! To think I could have a Mother like you! I feel very honored! He stopped it? What unbelievable strength! But my right hand has penetrated his vital organs! Oh no, it's almost dawn! I have to kill him and leave this place! I can't pull my arm! You will not escape! No matter what happens to Rengoku afterwards I have to do it! I have to cut off the demon's head! Faster! Dawn is breaking! Sunlight will fall here! I have to get out of here! I will never let you go Not until I've cut off your head! Let me go! Inosuke, move fast! For Mr. Rengoku! Move! Beast Breathing!First Fang! Pierce! I have to get away from the Sun immeadiately! This is bad! I must be as far away from the Sun as possible! Don't run away! Don't run away, you coward! Don't run away! What kind of nonsense is that? Doesn't he have any brains in his head? I'm not runnig away from the Demon Slayer Corps- I'm running away to escape the Sun! Besides, this fight is already over! Soon he'll run out of strength and die! No matter where it is the Demon Slayer Corps will always be there! Fighting in the darkness that's the only place you can fight! We are flesh and blood! Our wounds cannot heal easily Lost limbs don't grow back! So why are you running?! you bastard! You wicked, despicable creature! Compared to the likes of you Rengoku is far greater! Far greater than you! Rengoku hasn't lost! He didn't let anyone on the train die! He fought to the end and successfully protected everyone! You lost! Rengoku defeated you! Don't scream so loudly boy. The wound in your belly will open up. Your injury is not minor. And, if you die... I won't have my victory anymore. Mr. Rengoku. Come to me. I have something to tell you. I remember something i saw.. ...in my visions of the past. Of the home where I was born. Visit House Rengoku. There is a collection of notes left by Flame swordsman of the past. My father read them often. But I didn't... So I have no idea of its contents. What you told me earlier about the Dance of the Fire God. They may contain records of the Hinokami Kagura you mentioned. Mr. Rengoku, please... that's enough. Please use breathing to stop the bleeding! Is there no way to make the wound heal? No. I'm going to die soon. But I have something to say, So listen. Please tell my brother Senjuro to take the path that he thinks is right. To follow his heart. This is my wish. Tell my father. to take care of himself. And, so... young Kamado. I believe in your little sister. I consider her a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. On the train, i saw her... shed her blood to protect humans. Striving to protect others. Risking her life to fight demons. She protected humanity. No matter what anyone says, Your sister is part of the Demon Slayer Corp!. Stand tall and be proud. Regardless of how weak you feel No matter how hard you are hit. Keep your heart burning. Grit your teeth and move forward. If you stop and hide the flow of time will not stop for you. Time will pass by while you wallow in grief. Don't let my death fall too heavily upon you. I am a Hashira. I am a shield for younger generations. I am a Hashira... and any of them would do the same. We can't let the younger generation be plucked. Young Kamado. Boar-head boy. Yellow-haired boy. You must continue to grow. Believe in the near future. You are the future of the Demon Slayers. That's what I believe. I trust you from the bottom of my heart. Mother... ...Did I do well? Things I had to do, things I had to practice. Did I use my gifts wisely? You did splendidly. When the train derailed Rengoku used many techniques. To minimize the damage to the carriages. and reduce the harm to the passengers. I know he did. How could such a person die? Did a Upper Moon really show up? Why did a Upper Moon demon come here? Are they really that powerful? How could... Why is it... when you're close to accomplishing something, right in front of you, another barrier appears. Novice swordsmen, all powerful, all killed and fought in far away places. And yet I still don't have the ability to go there. I feel like I'm falling behind! Can I ever become strong like Rengoku? Don't say such discouraging words! You CAN or you CAN'T! Don't sit there wondering about the maybes! He said he believed in us! In addition to his trust, So there's no reason to think about these things! Everything that dies returns to the earth! Even if you cry It won't bring any on them back! Don't cry, no matter how frustrated you feel! No matter how miserable, no matter how humiliated! We must keep on living! But aren't you crying too? Tears came out of your headpiece. I'm not crying! Come on! We have to train! So that's how it is, Rengoku is gone... The Upper Moons. Even Rengoku was no match? I do not believe it. Namu Amida Butsu... I will annihilate all unsightly demons. I see. Two hundred passengers on the train and no one died. Kyojuro worked very hard. He was an incredible young man. He won't be lonely. After all, I don't have much time left myself. Soon, I will meet with Kyojuro and the rest, in the Land of Eternal Spring. Rengoku...! Rengoku...!
