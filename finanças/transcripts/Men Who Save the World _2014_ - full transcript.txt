There it is! Let's do it. Hit it! What are you waiting for? Come on! We want to play the kompang a bit longer, Pak Awang. What's the use of kompang in the jungle, Khamis? Whose idea was it? We thought... maybe the loud kompang will chase away those "things". What’s this bullshit? Come on. Let’s go. Don't be scared. Hit it! Watch out for the thorns. Finally! How’s it like in there? All OK! Why did people call this the American House? Because it was painted white. White House. My God! Help me in here! What happened? Don’t move. Let me see. What's going on, Pak Awang? Just pull... Just pull... Help me! Pak Awang! The floor, it broke! Megat! Come on, help me... Pull... One, two, three... Careful! Don't come in! The floor will crash! One, two, three... Don’t pull so hard! Something might break! One, two, three! What now? Hit it! There’s a nail! Hang on! Don’t jump around. The house will collapse! Make it louder! Don't ever stop! Louder! Louder! It’s raining! Run for it! Hey Chinaman. Don’t you want to describe your theory to the guys? What theory? Let’s hear it. People with slit eyes... they see better. Hey, Pak Awang. Congratulations. Thanks. When is the wedding ceremony? When this house is ready. But this house is in worse shape than we thought. It’s not that bad. I’ll fix it up after we've moved it back to the village. Men Who Save The World 'United Youth League' They’re here! The kompang boys, take your places. Get ready, everyone! Hit it! Make it louder! What’s this? Who's doing it wrongly? The ‘S’ is supposed to be there. Pak Awang, over here! The ‘T’ must be here. Correct it! What? What's going on? Put on a big smile! That's not a “B”! It's “D”. Make it into a "D" now! Get closer! Show more enthusiasm! They are approaching! Keep smiling! Kompang, louder! Smile! Smile! Peace be with you. And upon you be peace. Welcome, Mr. Juta Seri to our humble village. How are you? Praise to God. Come see me later. Yes, of course. Thank you. This way, Mr. Juta Seri. After you. Make way. Let's introduce the villagers. 'Camel Donation Ceremony' Mr. Juta? This is Pak Awang. He’ll be marrying off his daughter soon. At the moment, he’s getting her house ready. Congratulations. Thank you. Peace be with you. And upon you be peace. Tie it! Thanks. Go ahead. Peace be with you. And upon you be peace. In the name of God, the most Gracious and Merciful. Today, I feel extremely... honoured and touched, to see so many of you at this ceremony. Some are wearing Unity Program shirts... Some are wearing United Youth League shirts... BUT with Unity Program caps. Some are not wearing caps... but wearing headscarves and so on... No matter what you have on your body, what’s important is that the League is in your hearts. Long live the League! Thank you! We want our country to progress to greater heights. So that people will not insult us, or make fun of us. We must unite this possible... Sorry, I mean we must unite this precious country... so that when we are inclusive... we can work... What should I do? Blow? Leave it... Looks like a waterfall. Look, it's just like water. So, I’d like to take this opportunity... to "remember" our brothers and sisters... There’s the smoke...there! What are you up to? Good afternoon, teacher. We’re doing magic. Magic? Making smoke-rings? Not smoke-rings. It’s like a waterfall. Put that down. Get away from here. I never want to see you here again. I don’t ever want to see you either. Here. Get closer. OK everyone! Get closer to Mr. Juta. Look here. Smile. One, two three. Again. Why did your daughter... suddenly decide to come back to the village? The city is not a good place for her. What does she do there? Who’s she marrying? Someone she loves. Doesn’t it go without saying... that we marry someone we love? Love? I give you for RM10. You see... You cannot get a better price. You can try. You'll see it's of good quality. It’s quite good, you see? The quality is quite good. You want this one? I have this, man. It's RM15, man. Hello sir? I'm selling belts. This is a very good belt. And watches, you can try these watches. It's very good. Bobo! What's up? Gangsters! Give me the watch! Shut up and just do it! Come on, please... Get up! Let's go! Hey! Get him! He's getting away! Eat up, Kamal. Stop bothering it, Hamka. What are you all doing here? It's not a zoo. Go home everyone. Hamka, you too. Go home. Go home Zakari. It's like these village folk have never seen a camel before. This house moving project is laborious. You'll have to physically carry it for a long distance. I agree. Besides, the route back to the village is full of obstacles. It might take two weeks for us to carry it back. I don’t think it'll take that long. At most, maybe five days. Are you certain, Pak Awang? Five days only? Pak has to take into consideration... that most of us are no longer young. And one of us is blind. What is the concern? If we have enough men, there won't be any problems! The American House. What do you think? The architecture is pretty, Pak. (Indonesian accent). Such intricate details. I finally understand why Pak desires the house. How much? It will cost about 10,000... Pak. In your currency or mine? It won’t be that cheap, Pak. And it's not nice to make jokes like that. But can’t it be lower? You have to understand, Pak. The cost of materials have all gone up, Pak. What colour of paint do you want, Pak? The original colour. White. For wood we have two options. Do you want cheap ‘tapioca’ or expensive ‘cheese’? Tapioca... The tapioca option is called Lainbow Colours, Pak. It's made in China, Pak. For your house... We'd need two and a half or three gallons, Pak. The paint alone would cost RM3,000, Pak. That doesn’t include labour cost yet, Pak. No need for labour. I can do all the painting. By myself. Yes, "Malaysians can do it". But what about the rest, Pak? The roof is leaking, the floor... has a big hole. Can you handle all that yourself, Pak? God is Great. God is Great. I bear witness that there is no other god but God So there are two sides. We need between 40-50 people. Because each bamboo stick needs 8-10 people. Where did the 8 come from? I just said 5. If there are 5 people, for each side we need 25 people. 5 bamboo sticks multiplied by 5, how much? But who was it who said earlier... that in the front we need... It can’t be 8, then it’ll be 100! So to sum up, how many person does each side need? Each side has 5 bamboo sticks! Is everything secure? Have you counted them all? Climb up if you’re ready. All together! Push it to the end! Done? Please carry everything with you. - Do we have enough? - Yes! The lorry can start now. Climb on board! OK lorry, move! Get up! Please help Pak Awang up! Pak Awang! Looks like you have an audience here. Wouldn't it be nice if you could give us a song? That’s right Pak Awang. We are all here because of him, right? Right! OK! Hello! Test! Here, Pak Awang. Give us a song. Just one song. Since when could I sing? Of course you can. OK, but just this once. Don’t ever ask again. I don’t want to remember the old days. OK! Sure! I don't know other people’s songs. I can only do my own song. Sure, Pak Awang! Anything from you is fine. # If it’s true... # that in yearning there's vengeance. # Who was it who invited me... # to her wedding last night? # If it’s true... # that even fools have moments of wisdom, Why did he quit singing? He always got cheated. # I am but a tapioca. # Not a fancy wedge of cheese. # I am but a tapioca. # Not a fancy wedge of cheese. One more time! # I am but a tapioca. # Not a fancy wedge of cheese. # I am but a tapioca. # Not a fancy wedge of cheese. Pak Awang is the man! Aji and Pak Man? Can we proceed? Yes, it's ready. OK, I'll inform the rest then. OK. OK. The destination of the house is all clear. Listen up! Get ready everyone! All set? OK, Pak Awang! In the name of God! We’ll prepare to move now. But first I want to remind you, Hold the bamboo tightly. When we’re set to move, what do we say? Huh Hah! Huh Hah! Huh Hah! Huh Hah! Even if the sky were to crash down on us... We’ll shrug it off like a blanket. Because we are... the men who will save the world! Men who will save the world! Men who will save the world! Men who will save the world! Good! On the count of three, we start! Ready? All ready! Ready! One! Two! Three! People in front, to the left! To the left! More! More! More! We can’t pass. OK! If we can’t pass, we reverse! Reverse! That side, lift it higher! Lift it higher! Higher! Look for the base! Mind the stilts! Be careful, watch the stilts. Further to the back! Lift it higher! Even higher! Watch out for the stilts at the back! Carry on! Carry on! Keep going! The back is stuck! Stuck! Stuck! Stop! Stop! We are stuck! One! Two! Three! To the left! To the left! Slowly! Not too fast! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Are we there yet? Set it down! One! Two! Three! Praise to God! This is the spirit we wanted. The spirit of... Huh Hah! Huh Hah! Huh Hah! Huh Hah! Ready? Ready. One, two, three! My turn! My turn! Ready? Ready. One... two, three. I want to see. Is it OK? You've to press this button. - It's beautiful, right? - Yes. Now press this button to turn it off. Prophet Ibrahim was sad and sorrowful. But because he was a faithful servant of God, Prophet Ibrahim... He obeyed. So what happened was... When Prophet Ibrahim was about to slaughter his son, Ismail... God stopped him. God said it was just a test. A test? Yes, so Ismail’s life was spared. He was replaced by a goat and that was sacrificed. Grandpa... Is it OK if we don’t sacrifice Kamal? Kamal? Who's that? Oh, come on. It's the camel at the mosque. Oh, it has a name now? Even if we don’t sacrifice it, we’ll have to replace it with another animal. Same thing. I hope all the men here won’t disappear later. True. Look what happened last year. After prayers, there was hardly anyone left to help. Just the same 2 or 3 people. But during the time to distribute the meat... so many turned up. We don’t want something like that to happen. I expect that to happen. Help! Everyone has to be responsible... What's that? Help! Help! Please! It’s Wan! Help him! Wan! Wan! What’s wrong? Everyone, get out here! Help him! What’s wrong? Wan, what is it? What happened? Say something, Wan. What happened? What's wrong with you? Chief asked you, Wan. Tell us what happened. Chief, I was walking... close to the American House. And then suddenly... I saw the scariest thing I have ever seen! A ghost! What has this boy been sniffing? He might be possessed. Of all things! There, that’s enough. Wan. Get up. I said get up! Lift him up. Get up, Wan. Lift him up. Just get up. Stand straight. I feel like shit. Mr. Muezzin? Yes, Chief? Do something for this boy. Alright. He's here. Chief! Chief! That’s OK. I’m fine. If you give me RM10, I’ll be fine. I can buy medicine. Be quiet. Mr. Muezzin is trying to heal you. Just RM10 is all I need, bro. Wan, be quiet! Hey, you shut up, too! But I was telling him to shut up! But you should shut up, too. Everyone shut up! Be quiet! I'll be quiet. I'll be quiet. Quiet! I'll be quiet! Everyone be quiet! I'll be quiet! I'll be quiet if you just give me RM5! Can everyone be quiet! I’m trying to concentrate here. Chief, I’ve recovered. Wan? Wan, are you OK? Chief... So, what now? All OK. I mean... How are we going to lift the house tomorrow? What do you mean? What if Wan was telling the truth? God have mercy on you! Look... Don’t fill your head with nonsense. We've to be rational. But it's better for us to do the safety prayers... before we start tomorrow. God willing. Watch your step. God be praised. Bless you. We are almost there. Are you OK? Mr. Muezzin! Thank you for coming. Awang! Hey, I feel chilly. Is this place cold or is it just me? It might just be you. I'm nice and warm. Shall we begin? May God forgive us. There is no god except He, Who is living, eternal... and I repent unto Him. There is none worthy of worship but You. Glory to you. Verily I have been among the wrong-doers. The Opening. Praise be to God, Lord of all the worlds. You alone do we worship, and You alone... Run! Oh my God! Oh my God! What’s this? Come back here! Why are you running? Why are they running? Who told us to run? Come back! Who told us to run? Who? Come back! All of you! Useless bunch! Who shouted to run? It seemed like someone at the back. Enough! Let’s not waste anymore time. Get into your positions. Chief... Please step aside. Right. On three. One! Two! Keep going! Maintain your strength! Keep going! To the left! Mind the hole. At the front, to the left! At the back, to the right! Get into place! Keep going! Khamis! Khamis! Your daughter! Your daughter! What? Khamis, what happenned? What's going on? Khamis? There’s one here. And another here. On her elbow and wrist. What does that mean? Normally, if there are such bruises, that means Satan bit her. Oh, damn. But fret not. We’re not fully sure. It could just be a natural injury or... My dear... Tell daddy... What did he do to you? Did he touch you? Don’t be scared. Tell your father. Tell me. Don’t be scared. Daddy’s here. Do you think... what people say about that house is true? Don’t believe in superstition. Can't you recall? From the moment we touched that house... all sorts of things happened to our village. On the first day we went there... Megat and Apan got injured. See? That was like a warning to us all. And then Wan... He saw something so scary he got hysterical. Then now, Khamis’ daughter. These are not coincidences. Want know something? What? My cattle have all disappeared. So? They disappeared the day we first moved the house. What could your lost cows have to do with that house? Cows always get lost, right? If that camel suddenly disappears... You'll say it’s connected to the American House too? Zakari... Zakari... Zakari... Oh it’s you. Come on! Unlock the pen. Where did you get these keys? From my grandpa of course. Don’t you know it’s wrong to steal? You’ll go to Hell. Oh come on. Just go unlock it. I’ll give them back to grandpa later. Got it? Oh Kamal... Wait. Don’t call him yet. Come on. Wait. - I want to put this down. - OK! - I stand by first. - Ready? One, two, three! It's heavy right? It’s heavier than I thought. It's getting lighter now. Kamal! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Stop kidding around! Hurry. Shut it. Kamal... Oh no... He’s going back inside! Hurry! Kamal, here... Here! Don’t go anywhere. Kamal. This rope might break. You help pull here. His eyes are watery. Kamal! Shoo! Go away! Tomorrow they’re going to slaughter you! He’s still not going? Go away! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Zakari! Come! I refuse to believe this! I refuse to believe this! Someone must have opened the pen last night. The key is with me. The key is in my hand! Chief? Did anyone else have the keys besides you and Mr. Muezzin? No one else! Only me and him! Chief, calm down. I don't get it. How could that camel have just vanished? Chief, my cows vanished the same way too. Could you stop talking about your damned cows! You cow! Who on earth? Hello. Peace be with you. Speaking. Yes. No worries. We shall meet at the mosque again. It's OK. No worries. I've checked the accounts. There are no issues. There is still balance. There is. Yes. Can see better? Gosh! Wow, what a big bracelet. You are so tall My God. Is this hair... or metal wires? Who are you? Solomon. Solomon? Are you for real? Who exactly are you? Who? Mr. Juta Seri's friend. Friend of Mr Juta Seri? Oh dear, I'm so sorry. I didn't realise. Solomon? You know Malaysia... Truly Asia? His daughter... has this blue black mark on her flesh. Which part? Around here... and here. Mr. Muezzin said it could be the bite of... What-do-you-call-it? The camel... You keep looking for it. This girl... She saw a black shadow? Yes sir. And you... young man, what did you see? Wan, speak up. What did you see that night? Go in. Busy body. Don’t be afraid. Don’t worry. I'm here to help. I saw a black figure too. Black? Black... 'Encyclopedia of Malay Ghosts' The ghost’s head was attached to its body? Yes. Was it flying around? It was on the ground. So it’s black, travels on the ground... Was it oily? Well, it looks.. black and a little shiny. Don't screw up, don't screw up. My instincts tell me that... it’s a demon! A demon covered in black oil. The Oily-Man? Is it really the Oily-Man, sir? If you think it is, then that's what you think! What should we do now? Must not sit back and wait. Attack the demon! Go all out to attack! Attack, like a game of football. Forget the 4-4-2 formation. Go for... 1-1-8! 1-1-8? How? 1 defender... 1 midfielder... 8 strikers! But it sounds kind of dangerous, sir. Who's this guy? He's Chinaman. But I’m Malay, sir. I got this name because... Are you a man or a woman? Man or woman? Man... Are you sure? Speak! Speak! Man... Man or a woman? Speak! Male... Maybe female! No! Man or a woman? Man, I think... If you are a man, you don't need to worry. The Oily-Man only appears at night to rape women. Especially virgins. Oh no! My daughters at home are in danger! My mother too! Come back! Sit down! But my daughters at home... Come and sit down. Don’t worry. Before you leave, you must get these talismans from my intern. These talismans can be worn, or placed at the front entrance of your house. Got it? I'll give you 50% discount. You... I see darkness hunting you down. Something bad will happen to you if you are not careful. You've to get a talisman. The bigger the better. No... I mean... What if Wan is pulling our legs... about the whole Oily-Man story? Remember how he made up stories... about the speakers he stole from the mosque? How do you explain my daughter’s case then? Pak Awang, my family is the target now. This is a matter of life and death. We’ll follow the shaman's advice. He's right. Action is better than prevention. We should go for it. Hopefully... We can find the missing camel too. What do you think? Chief? Do it. I'm in. I'm in. Now, no matter what... Do not open the windows. Do not open the doors. Not until you hear the secret knock. What is the secret knock? Good. I have to go. From afar, our vision will be blurry. But then, when we squint our eyes... When we squint our eyes, there's less light... and our vision will become sharper and clearer. Hence, we see more clearly. Don’t understand. Do you? I don’t understand either. Hold on! Hold on! Look, they are here. Peace be with you! And upon you be peace! So everyone is here? All come forward, please. I've got some weapons here. Listen up. We'll distribute them later. But before that, I want to remind you, that we'll... We'll split into two groups. The 1st group will patrol in the village. And the 2nd group... will patrol the outskirts of the village. Clear? Khamis? Shall we patrol around the American House too? I don’t think so. Nights like this can be dangerous and scary. Right? Pak Awang? Pak Awang? What are you up to? Nevermind. Let's go! Stick together. Don't make too much noise. Are there batteries in the torchlight? Let's move. Don’t talk so loud. Just whisper. Specky... Yes? Do you see anything over there? Nothing at all. As I said earlier... Squint your eyes. Then you will see clearer. Don't talk so loud. - Mat Kompang? - Who's that? You overstepped. Come back here. Chinaman... As I said earlier, we split into two groups. You and your group patrol over there. Wan? Wan? Hey! I’m talking to you. Leave me alone. Listen, I just want to talk to you. What? Look... Things are getting worse... I don’t care... if what you said is true or not. I don’t care what your intention is. I don't... I don't want to judge you, Wan. I just want to... continue moving the house. OK. Got it. Wait. Take a look at it first... Wan! Here... Here... Look. You are hurting me! Look here... For you. What for? Do me a favour, Wan. Tell all the villagers that... you didn't really see a ghost. Tell them you are short sighted or something. You are crazy. I'm not finished yet! Come back here. What's going on there? Hey! What's going on here? Pak Awang! What are you doing here? Mind your own business! Pak Awang? Wan! What's going on? Hey! What do you think? I'm quite confident. Chief, don’t make any noise. Lay low... This camel is still young, still not used to our presence. It's a baby camel. Chief, that’s the camel. Just look from a distance. We’ve found one. Look. Get that thing out of my sight before I kick its ass! You all are a bunch of clowns! Chief... Piss off! Chief! Chief! Chief! Actually I know a fast way to get a camel. What do you mean? Recently, I got to know someone who has a camel. Where? Not far from here, chief. How much is he selling it for? As per market price, chief. Which is? How much did our camel cost? RM6k But the big mock-up cheque says... RM100k, chief? Of course. The RM94k is for... the processing and miscellaneous fees. That's not so important. So Apan... How much is your friend's camel? The price is... RM8k. That’s expensive. RM2k is for the processing and miscellaneous fees. Furthermore, I'm not friends with the guy. Is he trustworthy? He says... "your-money-guaranteed-is-back" When can we see the camel? We can check it out now. Now? This camel might be different from the one we had. I don't care how it looks like. Anyway, to me all camels look alike. Dear? Is everything OK? Nothing. Go back to bed. I’ll be right back. Is this about the American House again? Well yes... But you see, our village... Our village is going nuts. As the Chief, you really have to... Awang, I know... But can you wait for a little longer? My priority is to restore peace in the village... and the situation of the camel... What am I going to tell Mr. Juta Seri? Look. Give me 2-3 days? At least, let the madness subside first? Then, we'll come back to your problem. Well, I'm just concerned... Yes, I understand. Give me some time, like 2-3 days? OK? Did you see that? I saw. Shit... Be quiet... Where is it now? There, over there... Let's go! Attack! Pak Awang! It’s you! Pak Awang... What are you doing here so late at night? You all have gone crazy! Pak Awang, you shouldn’t be out here at this time. You could’ve gotten killed by us! Move.. Make way! Megat? Megat? Megat? Pak... What brings you here? I want to talk to you. Come down? What’s wrong with you? Nothing. Tell me. The villagers... What? I don't know. You believe what they said? Of course not. But I... I... You've gone mad. Just like them. So, did you guys bring your stuff? I brought this. Why did you bring your Mathematics textbook? You asked us to bring things that we dislike... He's coming! He's coming! Everyone get ready. Get ready with your stuff. On the count of three, we strike. Ready... Three... Two... One! Attack! Keep throwing! Keep throwing! Attack! Hey, what's this? Demon! Demon! Don't run! Come back here! God, please give me strength! May God forgive me. I think things have gone too far. Is that so? They say... that I've evil intentions in the house-moving. It’s a fine line between superstition and stupidity. I didn’t expect... things to go this wrong... Awang? Awang... Are you OK? I need the house... My daughter has to get married. Oh God... Hang in there, Awang. A real man sheds blood, not tears. Oh God... May God forgive me. I'm sorry. Hello everyone. I'll sing a song entitled... Testing. Testing. Testing one, two... What's this? Stop! It sounds awful. All must be simultaneous, with strong spirit. OK, once again. Raise... Hit it! Chief! Not again, Pak Awang. We need to talk. Awang... Please, not now. Listen first. Piss off! Pak Awang... I just want to clarify... that there's no ghost. I want everyone to know that the house is not haunted! Awang, not the house again! Calm down guys. Can't we talk it through? Let's talk it through. We talk later. Look. This matter’s been dragging on for too long! My reputation is tarnished. It's tarnished! Since everyone is here... I want to sort it out right here and now! Once and for all! The village is in a mess. And all you care about... is your own reputation! But that's not what I meant! Pak Awang! You should put aside your own interests. And start thinking about the villagers as a whole! Calm down! Show respect! Oh yes! I apologise! OK? I'm sorry if I caused such confusion! I’m not trying to be selfish here. It's good that you realised it. Can you please listen? What are you trying to do?! What's wrong with you?! I'm sorry, I didn't mean it! Demon! Who said that? What’s said it’s not important! Do you know the trouble you've caused them? It's all slander! Enough! Go and mind your own business! Stay away from us! Let's go! Chief, let's continue our work. Ignore him. Let's go everyone Why do you've to do this to me? Demon! Damn you! Damn all of you!!! We cordially invite Mr Juta Seri to officiate... the sacrificial ceremony for the Haj this year. Please, Mr Juta Seri. Please applaud. Praise to God. The ceremony has been officiated. Bring it down. Pull the rope tightly. OK. Let go of this string. The rest keeps pulling. Be careful. Tie the strings. God is Great. There is no other god but God. All praise is due to God. You want the Oily-Man? Good. I'll give you the Oily-Man. You wait. Have you ever considered... that this Oily-Man is the type that likes guys? Women dressed up as men will be in trouble instead... Homosexual Oily-Man! This gives us more reason to destroy that demon! Curse the devil! Curse the devil! Say your supplication. What's that? - Where is it? - Over there! Let's go! Let's go! What happened? What happened? The Oily-Man attacked! Over there! Sounds like it's coming from the other side! Hurry up! Hurry up! - You heard the scream? - Yes, it's from there! There! There! Hurry up then! Quick! It's OK now. Mum... The house is really jinxed. I knew it! Watch out... Quick. Over here. Three of you, go over there. There... There... Curse the Devil! Hurry up, over there. Send it back to hell! Burn it. God damn you! Go back to hell! Destroy the Devil! Back off! Get back! Retreat! Curse the devil! Go back to hell! Curse the Devil! Send it back to... Oh my God! Hey, friend. - Hello. - Hey. Hello! You come to visit village again?

Come. - Peace be with you! - And upon you be peace! Mr. Muezzin? Yes? Mr. Muezzin, who is this? This guy here? He's Solomon! Solomon? He is... a friend of Mr. Juta Seri. I see, Mr. Juta Seri! Friend of Mr. Juta Seri! Welcome! Welcome! The Oily-Man?! The Oily-Man! Kill him! Destroy the devil! Catch him! Don't let him escape! Move aside! Excuse me! Destroy the devil! Run faster! Faster! The Oily-Man! Catch him! Faster! Catch him! Hey friend?
