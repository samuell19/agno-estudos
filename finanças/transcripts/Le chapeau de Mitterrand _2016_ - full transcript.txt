This is preposterous! What on earth is this? It's a load of drivel! I've never seen such absolute drivel! It's outrageous! You've lost your mind! You're a menace, Mercier. You're irresponsible and inept! Your entire department is inept! What exactly do you want? To put a computer on every desk and on every floor? You want to bankrupt us? Here's what I think of your proposal! FINANCE DIRECTOR This is '86, mate. It's 1986 - not 2086. Stop living in cloud-cuckoo-land. I can always send you down to the basement. The archives are short-handed. This hat brings good luck. Your hat changed my life. It's a cursed hat. I look like a rascal. You're going to ruin us! Somebody answer! This hat is driving you mad! Hold on to Your Hat! Hi honey, can you talk? I can't, I'm busy. How are you? You sound a bit off. No, I'm fine. What's wrong? My IT proposal was turned down. You know what you should do? Go there. Our favourite restaurant. It's cheap and they serve your favourite on Wednesdays. I love you. Shitty day! My proposal is dead, I'm as good as fired. My wife is away. And our restaurant is closed. Closed So much for eating on the cheap. What the hell! - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. Do you have a reservation? Sorry, I didn't have time. - May I take your coat? - No, I'm fine, thank you. Number 15. Have you decided, sir? - The royal platter, please. - Very well, sir. The royal platter, sir. Thank you. Look, there he is. - Your cloakroom, Mr President? - No, thank you. - A dozen oysters. - Yes, sir. Steak, rare. - Salmon fillet. - Right away. I know he doesn't share my views, but foreign policy is and will remain the preserve of the head of State. I said so to Helmut Kohl last week. You're so right, Mr President. Here are our oysters. And the Pouilly-Fuissé. The best shellfish with the best wine. One must listen to the French, understand their hopes and fears, what they want for themselves and their families. What do you think, Daniel? I completely agree with you, Mr President. I knew you were a smart man, Mercier. That woman is stunning. Don't you agree, Mercier? Quite stunning, Mr President. I see you like women, Mercier. I can tell. I admit to having a way with the ladies, but... I love my wife. And I love my country. I love France, Mr President. It's suffering and needs help. You have a keen eye, Daniel. Your colleagues must think so too. That's right, they do. But Mr Maltard is giving me grief. Forget about him, Daniel. Life is full of Mr Maltards. It is men like you who will build the future. - Thank you, Mr... - Everything all right? Very good, thank you. - Have they left? - Yes, sir, a few moments ago. Uh, the bill, please. Goodbye, sir. "I said so to Helmut Kohl last week." Daniel! - Dad! - My little angel! You've grown in one week! - How are you, darling? - Good and you, my love? So, young man? - What's with the hat? - It's Mitterrand's hat. I can see that. I mean, it's actually his hat. What are you talking about? I'll explain at home. - How do I look? - Not like Indiana Jones. I'll show you Indiana Jones! Gently, honey. "FM". - You have to give it back. - No way. And why not? It's mine now, he's got others. Are you the president now? Fellow citizens, you who have put your trust in me, France needs you, I call upon... Honey, come on! What's her problem? You're in big trouble. She doesn't like stealing. Me? Are you mad at me? You stole that hat. Come on. I haven't given it back, that's all. You're setting a bad example. Don't worry, it's no big deal. What's so special about this hat? It makes me feel better. Stronger. Stronger how? Show me. The Board meeting is now open. Over to you, Mrs Lariviére. Our trading account was down in the second quarter. I feel strong, I feel strong! I am strong, I'm a winner! You can't go in, Mr Mercier. I'm very strong. It must be important. The investment accounts- You're out of line, Mercier. Chairman, excuse my intrusion. It's about the survival and future of this company. Chairman, this is an internal matter. This is a crucial matter on which Mr Maltard and I have opposite views. Please take a seat. Mr Maltard, the other day you upbraided me. You said I was a menace, I believe. I say you're behind the times and your time is up. You're a dead weight, Mr Maltard. You're clueless. Everything goes over your head. - Chairman... - I want to hear what he has to say. You're obsolete and have no vision. You're a man of inaction. A pen pusher. Too bad you want to keep Sogetec in the past. Too bad you don't see computers are the future. While our competitors change, invent and innovate, we... Well, we verify. We... We make sure, we stall, we improve. But we don't create. You see, Mr Maltard, I allowed myself to dream. I dreamt we were the first to invest in IT. I dreamt we created a network. Not only to hold meetings, but also to reach our customers, to connect with our partners and our allies, and to keep an eye on our rivals. Mr Maltard, I beseech you, if you want Sogetec to succeed, you need to move with the times or else we'll all fall behind. Two hundred and fifty employees on the street. Inertia would be costly. The meeting is closed. Mr Mercier! Mister Mercier. Why are you not further up the ranks of this company? We“... - Mr Maltard... - Maltard is a dolt. You know that. We both do. I was looking for his replacement. I've just found him. You start next month. Meanwhile, take some time off. Tell me...are you never apart? You and...it? No. Why, you don't like it? That's to say... You're not Indiana Jones, but it suits you. Don't change a thing. Dear friends, dear friends. Dear friends, I am pleased to present your new finance director. Please welcome him! Thank you. No, no. OK, all right. All right, thank you. Right, listen up. I don't do speeches. But I do promise you that from now on everyone will be treated equally. No more tongue-lashings. No more public humiliations. This is now a free country, we're friends and fellows, co-workers eager to innovate and move forward. We're here to help one another. A month ago I promised change. From now on, no more basement! It's all in here! I also want to thank Chairman Desmoines for his sound judgement and to give him the last word. Thank you, Mr Mercier. To all of you who work at Sogetec, I have only one thing to say. Once we've all had a drink, it's back to work! Cheers! Granny! Granddad! So good to see you. I did it, pop! My proposal went through! MY Pay has gone up. And Maltard is gone! Maltard got the push! I have my team, my budget, I'm the boss! - Well done! - Mummy, it's all thanks... It's all thanks to my hat. - Your hat? - My hat. Wait! My hat! Stop! No! Stop! Shit, my hat! No! Shit! You have to stop the train! Call all the stations and inspectors! - For a hat? - Yes! We do that when there is danger of if someone is very ill. A hat isn't someone. And it poses no danger. Wrong! This hat is in danger! This hat is in grave danger! Tax Inspector Competitive Examination Tax auditing. 'There are two kinds of tax audits: "audits based on records "and audits performed on the spot." - Do you smoke? - No, thanks. You prefer to be smoking...hot? Poison by Dior. Yes. So I see. You want to seduce... Let me show you something. I'm a glove salesman. I'm all over Asia. Only the finest. - Would you like to try? - Sure. Thank you. Isn't it soft? Look how soft it is... You're wasting your time. I'm getting married. And when is the wedding for? - Once he's got divorced. - Divorced? - Yes, he's married. - Married? - Does he have children? - Yes, three. - He won't wed you. - Why not? Married men don't wed. Especially fathers. Never. They promise to wed but don't. It's a ploy. As for me, I'm single. You have a speck of dust on... You Pig! Me, a pig! Cute, but a little outdated. You look stupid with that moustache. Do you practise being sleazy? Your hat. My glove, please. What are you looking at? I was looking at you and thinking how pretty you looked with your hat. - Me? - Yes. Thank you. Thank you, bye. I have to say, I feel funny now. Especially after what that pervert said. Now that I think of it, I've been waiting for six years. Maybe he'll never leave his wife. But I'll give him one last chance. All right. Come in, it's open. Hello. What's with the hat? What happened to "Hello"? Hello, my love. - Don't touch my hat. - Your hat? Yes, my hat. - It's a man's hat. - True. - So a man gave it to you? - You're jealous! Perhaps. You've brought another man's gift into our love nest. This, a love nest? - Have you spoken to your wife? - Who cares? I care - for the past six years. What's with you? You know it's hard for me. I need time. - You said you would. - She's depressed. - Not pregnant? - She had an abortion. I don't believe you. Take off that silly hat! Whose is it, anyway? Huh? It belongs to a man whom I met on the train. It's an old man's hat. True, he's a bit older than you. But he takes me to fancy restaurants. He's elegant, charming. And rich. He wants to be with me. - And we love making love. - What? The last time, I sat astride him with his hat. It felt good. It felt so good. It felt good with his hat. Edouard, I have big news for you. Since you'll never leave your wife, I'm leaving you. Six years you've strung me along, summer and winter, 45 weekends a year when you weren't with your family. Forty-five weekends making love in shameful secret. Empty promises... just like my bosses. Promises but no promotion. I'm still on the same rung. My title: official mistress! A glorified whore - on the cheap. Forty-five weekends of hope... I'll leave my wife, Fanny, I promise. Just give me a bit more time. The truth is, we haven't had sex in over a year. Liar! You're just a liar! You're pathetic and cheap! You're right. Go on, put me down. It's what I deserve. But stay and marry me. Go to hell! You just want to have it off. You've changed, Fanny. - You're different. - I have changed. I've changed! For some reason I've changed. Take a good look at me. This was my last lousy train ride to your lousy hotel. I don't care about your wife any more because it's over! I'm leaving you! I\\ \. I\ Q x \ K' I I'm throwing you out of my life! Get out! I never want to see you again. - You bitch! - Scram! Scoot, I don't want to see you! But I love you! Fanny! Fanny! Don't leave me. Keep your hat - and your old fart! No way! "FM". As in Fanny Marquant. Yes, "FM" as in Frangois Mauriac, Frédéric Mitterrand or Fifi Mimosa! Write this down: "Lost, black hat, 'FM', on train 612 "Lyons-Marseilles, "carriage 7, compartment 14, seat 86, on 09-07-86, reward." No! "Big reward"! I want it in every newspaper! Le Progrés, Le Dauphiné Libéré, La Provence, Paris Match, Le Nouvel Obs, Le Parisien, France-Soir and the regionals! - What else is there? - Le Chasseur Frangais? Exactly! Le Chasseur Frangais! For how long should it run? My entire life! This hat is driving you mad! I think I am going mad, but without it I'm nothing and I'll amount to nothing. Here! Goodbye, hat. Fair journey. And thank you. This hat isn't bad. Maybe a bit snobbish for a tramp, but I like it. All right... Let's go. Un Secret Asian's new inspiration Somebody answer! Don't just stand there, take it! It's unbearable! Where's Maria? I don't know. How am I supposed to practise like this? My concert is in eight days! Why are you dressed like that? Where were you? I went to the park. The park? Don't tell me you went out in your pyjamas? Don't touch me! I've had enough. How can I get ready in this mess? Pierre, I beg you. Make an effort. Shave that beard, dress normally, brush your hair. I can't stand seeing you like this. I'm sorry. I don't have time to look after you. I've failed you, I've failed everyone. You're upset, I'm upset. He, she, they're all upset. - Half the world. - Enough! That's enough. Come sit down. - Pierre. - Yes? You're my husband and I love you. You'll get over this. Go see Fremenberg. You've missed two sessions. You're better after seeing him, I promise you. See? Hearing his name already helps. Will you go see him? Go see him. One more? I love you. Call your shrink. Don't forget. Mum, the doctor's here! Hello, doctor. Please. - Hello. - Hello, doctor. My. my! I see. You have a bad case of eczema. Have you recently eaten something that disagreed with you? Have you lately been under a lot of stress? I lost my hat. That isn't serious enough to cause- It's very serious! It's a catastrophe. You wouldn't understand. I'm cursed. I'm cursed. Right. He needs a sedative and a stay at the Happy Days Clinic. - It's a mental asylum. - He thinks I'm crazy. He thinks I'm crazy! Dad, a man on the phone says he found your hat. So it's all in my head, is it? Hello? Yes, you read my ad? Thank you! Yes, black. To make me one? I don't want a new hat, I'm looking for a lost one! I don't care! I don't give a shit, you prat! That's right! I'm tired. I'm tired. - Dad, a lady on the phone- - She can go to hell! She says she found your hat marked "FM". Yes, hello. That's right, my ad. That's right, "FM". Black. You lost it? A tramp? A tramp has it now? Oh, no! I don't know why I picked it up. Probably because of the scents. There are two. A man's perfume, Eau d'Hadrien by Annick Goutal. A man of taste. The other... Bergamot, Arabian jasmine, opopanax, Tonka bean... It's mine. I created it six years ago. The perfume that revealed my genius. - Here. - What for? Keep it. - Please keep it. - It's too much. You listened to me. It's cheaper than Fremenberg. Bloody Fremenberg... No, thank you. It may seem simple, but this recurring theme... I'm pressing too hard, I need more interiority. It sounds so beautiful. You're amazing. It's Schumann who's amazing, dear. - What's with the hat? - I found it. I mean, I bought it. You know, from the swap shop. That's great, Pierre. You did something positive. You bought a hat! It means you've started to enjoy life again. Perhaps you'll even go back to work. My dear Pierre... You're a great nose. You are. Perhaps even the greatest. You haven't worn a hat for a while. It suits you. But that beard clashes with it. I think it makes you look... how shall I put it... - Odd. - Odd? I don't think so. Or maybe it's my jacket. Do I know you? Long time, no see. Maria, I'm going. Why are you crying? For no reason. I've got you back. You look 20 years yooncher. Maria's right, it's cool. I have a rehearsal. I'll be back soon. Your concert will be a great success. You'll see. Your shrink has worked wonders. - Stick with Fremenberg. - Sure... Carry on seeing him. I'll call you once I'm done. Fremenberg! It's no use hiding. You're mine now. Mine! Finders keepers. Serves you right for being out on your own. It's dangerous, old chap! What's your name, by the way? Mr... "FM". Mr FM. My dear FM, had I not found you, I wouldn't have shaved. But I did find you and I did shave. And had I not shaved, I wood not look 20 years yooncher. Yooncher, yooncher, yooncher! Hey-ho! Yooncher! I haven't laughed in five years. Yooncher! I'm yooncher, so much yooncher! "Yooncher", is that it? I was speaking to my hat. Don't you ever speak to your hat? No, I speak to my refrigerator. Muy refricherator, muy refricherator! Hey-ho! Muy refricherator! Fanny Marquant. Daniel Mercier, head of finance. - Your wife told me to come here. - Good. You'll think I'm crazy, but your hat changed my life. If you hadn't lost it, I wouldn't have met the man of my dreams. I'm the one who found the hat in your ad. But I don't have it any more. A tramp has it, but- - Shit! - No, not shit. The thing is, I know who he is. - Really? - Yes, I found him. Look. Not him. Come look. Come look. It's him, look. Pierre Aslan, see? He had a beard. He has your hat. Pierre Aslan. Thank you! Thank you! I found my hat! Yes, I found my hat! Say, I found my hat! Yes I did!

This is a restricted area. It's the smell. You like it too? - May I ask you a question? - Go ahead. Would my jacket burn? Excuse me? Would my jacket catch fire? Why would you want that? I need it. I've got my memory back! I've got my memory back! My memory! - Maria. - For heaven's sake! - You're soaked. - You're an angel, Maria. - Mr Aslan. - Yes? I'm spending July 14th with my sister. Everything's ready, come see. - Let's go. - Let me get you a dry shirt. Happy July 14th, senior Aslan. Thank you, Maria, same to you. Muito obrigado. Muito obrigado? You mean muchas gracias. Right, muchas gracias. Thank you, Maria, thank you. I'm not sure I got all that, but thank you. Have a good evening, senior Aslan. Maybe I'll go dancing. Olé! I'll get that hat dry. Thank you! - Hello, Mr President. - Hello, Mr Mourousi. I'm happy to welcome you today along with the millions of viewers who in a moment will watch and listen to us. This is our twelfth live broadcast of July 14th celebrations with the president of the Republic, six times with President Giscard d'Estaing and six times with President Frangois Mitterrand. And I hope you'll carry on. Something's burning. Is she mad? Mandarin, patchouli, orris. Bergamot. The fire. The roadman's wood fire. Bergamot, Siracusa lemon, patchouli, orange blossom, sandalwood, juniper berry... Here I am, my precious fragrances. - Wood fire. - Brilliant! Call him now before he goes to Chanel or Saint Laurent. - What is it called? - lncendie - blaze. "lncendie"! This will set the world on fire! - Set the world on fire! - Set the world on fire! Set the world on fire! Pierre Aslan on fire with lncendie! I'm late. How are you? - Well, and you? - Very well. - How are you? - Good? Still bankrupt? Good evening. Mrs Kerwitcz, you are a wonderful pianist. Tonight you communed with the angels. The concert was divine. Please accept my humble tribute. I'm touched, Mr Lavalliére. - What a boor! - Shush. He stinks! How can anyone wear Quasar? Such a vulgar cologne. Keep your voice down. Haven't you heard? His workers are all striking. Bugger off, Santelli! Deal with it! - They've locked us out. - Send in the riot police! Can't you see I'm having dinner? Go on, clear off. Let's go, honey. - Shall we go? - Yes. What a ninny! With that cologne no wonder his workers are striking. Quasar is olfactory suicide. Leave him alone already. - Have you known him long? - Are you jealous? Me? All the same you haven't said a word about my concert. I don't commune with the angels, I love them. Fine words for fine thoughts! Maria! Could you please answer the door? She isn't here, today's her day off. Of course it is. No, Mr Mercier. Twice you've come. And twice I've asked you to leave me alone. I'm sorry, I beg you. Esther! Can you find that hat for me? She'll be right back. Thank you. - Thank you, Mr Aslan! - Don't mention it. You can have it. It's a cursed hat. - Cursed? - Yes. On the contrary, this hat brings good luck. It's saved several lives. You know whose it is? Look, "FM". Does that ring any bells? "FM". "BL"? This isn't my hat. Mine neither! - Quasar! - What? Quasar! The boor's cologne! The boor...? Oh my, he doesn't look good. Mr Mercier! Strange, it feels like it's shrunk. A fine waste of money that was. Though I do like it a bit tighter. I look like a rascal. Can you hear me? Yes, no need to yell like that! For a boss whose workers are on strike, "rascal" may not be so wise. Are you ready? Let's go. That hat is too loud. I don't like it any more. Well, I like it. I don't why but I like it. All right, let's go. I might take up singing again. I've always wanted to sing. I'm worried about you. The lift had to be down! Wait for me. They'll feed us their vile apricot chicken. The Vaunoy cook very well. Sure they do... Common people like my concierge cook very well. When has she ever cooked for you? There they are! Hello, Charlotte. - Bernard. - Hello, Marie-Laure. Follow me. Hugues! - How are you? - Hello, Bernard. - Béatrice. - Bernard. - How are you? - One hour. - What? - One hour to find parking. - Not you? - Yes, well... Interesting. Some titbits to keep you occupied. I'm looking forward to this... To Marie-Laure de Vaunoy! To Marie-Laure! Thank you - to you all! Disgusting. Apricot chicken! - I kept it simple. - And light. Well done, Marie-Laure! Have you seen Co-Co Boy? Can you believe it? - Naked women on TV! - We don't have a TV. We went to watch Esther Kerwitcz. - Has anyone else? - Yes. I saw her four years ago. She played Bach. She was magnificent. You're so lucky! I prefer Rubinstein. Rubinstein can't play Bach. - Isaac Stern! - He's a violinist, dear. - Vladimir Horowitz? - No! It's Glenn Gould. Have you noticed how great musicians are all Jewish? - Really? - So what? I'm just saying, musicians and bankers are Jewish. They're everywhere. So are fools. - Meaning? - Meaning fools are everywhere. I'm not sure what to make of that. Anyone for more chicken? No, thanks! Greetings one and all! - He's drunk as a skunk! - Jéréme! - I frowned the addresh. - Of? Bernard Lavalliére. Stay with him, I'll get aspirin. No! You must be joking! Absolutely not! Lavalliére, you've gone too far. - You're impossible today. - Serge Gainsbourg! What about his outburst on TV? He was drunk and drugged on Gitanes. What an unsavoury character with his ragga Marseillaise... You mean "reggae.._ Reggae, raggay'!... He's a disgrace to France! - I think he's quite funny. - The national anthem is sacred. That's right. If you want to see a scandal, go to Paris. A pyramid at the Louvre! As if we needed a pyramid at the Louvre! - Why not? - Why not? Why not stick an Eiffel Tower in Luxor while we're at it? - What would the Greeks say? - Honey... Luxor isn't in Greece. You mean la Concorde in Paris ? There's a pyramid in la Concorde? It's all the Lefl's fault. I bet Mittrand will run again. Mittrand? He certainly might. Unsavoury character! Worse, Mittrand's the devil! If you would please pronounce his name correctly. It's Mitterrand. Have you gone over to the Left? Mitterrand isn't the devil. He's a smart politician. Mittrand is Machiavellian. You wouldn't know, Colonel. I doubt you've read Machiavelli. I hear you're battling to put down a strike. Is that so? Are you afraid of the people? You're a fossil, Larnier. Stay buried. Bernard! In olden days we'd have a field duel. - Colonel! - You're right. Asses like you belong in the fields. Surely you aren't going to fight? Shall we go? This was lovely. Good night. Excuse us, excuse him. Charlotte... What about dessert? - You upset all our friends! - Our friends... How are they our friends? That isn't friendship. Hyenas is what they are. What do I have in common with them? Same background, same schools, same society parties. But one word out of place and they turn on me. All I need is a yellow star. Why...are you Jewish? You all right, dear? Godawful prune chicken! Apricot, dear. What's the matter now? I don't know. I'm changing. It's my hat. - Your hat? - Yes, my hat. When I put it on, I change. I see things differently. Look. "FM". Those aren't my initials. - It isn't my hat. - It doesn't matter. We'll get it back to its owner. Certainly not. No one's taking this hat from me. It has powers. Aphrodisiac powers, it would seem. Oh, come on! Ah, Santelli! I need your advice. Mr Lavalliére, things are bad. - The unions want more. - Well then, give them more. Why? Think of the shareholders. And why not? How would you like a rise? Me? All right. What do you think? We“... Let's try another hat. This one. I like to stroll down the busy street So much to see, so much to see So many people to meet I go wherever I'm taken by my feet Zigzagging through the crowd I feel so proud I'm not a millionaire I'm a turner at Citroén - What do you think? - Well... You've never had any artistic sense. - Tell them yes. - We're headed for disaster. Thank you, Santelli, see you there. Go on, bugger off. Honey, get dressed! We're going out. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. You've changed, I really like it. Have you sorted out the strikers? It's taken care of. What exactly does that mean? It means I gave them a rise. Now things are better. - You gave them a rise? - Yes. I did it this morning. - Right after we made love. - Tell me you're joking! - You are joking? - Not at all. We're going there now. I wanted you with me. - I'll introduce you. - Introduce me? It's my factory! By the way, I'm going to learn all of Edith Piaf's songs. Come inside, Milord... You're going to ruin us! Thank you for coming, Mr Lavalliére. Call me Bernard. You know Charlotte, my wife. - Ready? - After you. - Let's go. - Come, dear. After you, Santelli. Sit down, please. There. I wanted to come say hello and tell you... I wanted to introduce my wife, Charlotte Lavalliére, whose dad owns all the shares in this firm and who inspired all these changes. So... I wanted to tell you how productive these past years have been. I know you've been brave. I know we've had our differences. I didn't come here to make a speech. I'd like to - here. Pour me a glass. Thanks. Here's to our new understanding. The new wine may not have arrived, but the new boss has arrived. And I promise you. I promise you... How about we drink instead of talk? Speech! Speech! Speech! No speech, no speech. Help me up, please. Now. There. No speech, but if you don't mind... You're something else. But I like you this way. I don't recognise you. But I recognise us. This is how we were when we were 20. We just forgot. ' My hat! ' My hat! What do you mean, your hat? Are you FM? Got a death wish, old man? I'd like my hat back, please. Sir... Thank you. Thank you. Why'd you give that wanker his hat back? He was polite. True that. He was polite. I've got it! I've got it! I've got it! I've got it! I've got it! I've got it. I've got it! Mum, the gondolas are going to crash. It's quite the traffic jam. Can you remember? We were here nine years ago. That's how old I am. - Give it. - Stop! - Stop! - No. Stop it now. Thank you. Good day. Allow me to present myself: Paul Lefort, Elysée presidential staff. I saw you on St Mark's Square and I noticed your hat. And? I assume you've seen the initials inside? Yes. And so, unless I'm mistaken, it doesn't belong to you? I assume you know who it belongs to? If you don't mind, I will keep this hat. I'd like to give it myself. We're at the Hotel San Luca. Daniel Mercier. Of course, Mr Mercier. Good day. Signore? I'm supposed to meet the President. - Frangois Mitterrand. - This way. - Good evening, Mr Mercier. - Good evening, Mr President. Have a seat. - There's a reward. - I don't want it. Since you don't want the reward, let me tell you a secret. I lost this hat in Lyons. It's travelled a long way since. Yes. We'll never know where or how. No. "FM", right? Uh, yes. "FM". Not "BL", this time. No, it isn't... Do you often come to Venice, Mr Mercier? Not since my honeymoon. I'm here with my family. Would you try it on for me? It looks good on you. Come to dinner at the Elysée. I'd like to meet your family. What is your son's name? Indiana Jones, Mr President.
