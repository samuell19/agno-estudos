And now for the local news. Let's go to Claire Chang, who has a special report from Haskins College in Cambridge. - As September 8 is fast approaching, it's hard for many to hear the name "Kate Fisher" back in the news. Her recent appointment here at Haskins College recalls a time 2 years earlier when college campuses across the state of Massachusetts were terrorized by serial killer Max Hersog. Hersog, who dressed in the uniform of a police officer, lured 7 young women to their deaths before being apprehended. Before Hersog took his last victim, however, he contacted Kate Fisher, a well-known Boston journalist. He confessed to the crimes, but instead of turning him over to police, Fisher, thinking Hersog was a fraud, sat on the interview. Many argue that Fisher's decision may have cost Laura Rose her life, as Hersog went on to abduct and murder her before police were even made aware of his identity, which is why her appointment to teach Ethics in Journalism at Haskins College, has many shaking their heads in dismay. - Mom, the power went out again! - Of course. - Our newest addition! How wonderful. It's amazing how easy it is to get a job around here, no matter what you do. - Lucky for you, Professor Gildon, that you have tenure. - Yes. How unlucky for you. - Kate! So glad you could make it. How are you settling in? - Moving back home has a way of making you feel like a kid again. - You've met everyone? - There's plenty of time for that. - Yeah. Kate, meet Becky Wade. She's joining us this year, helping out in the administration. Becky, this is Kate. - Nice to meet you, Kate. I was thrilled to find out you'd be working here. - Thank you. What a nice thing to say. Will you be in my class? - No such luck, I'm afraid. But I used to watch you on the news with my family all the time. - Kate Fisher. Must be nice to have such an influential benefactor. - Pardon me? - That's enough. - No, no, no. It's OK. It never ceases to amaze me when the guests are more polite to the bartender than their own host. - I think Professor Gildon is still angry that he was not asked to fill your position himself. - I don't think it helps that I slammed his book in The Post 2 years ago. Well, it doesn't take people long to start talking. - Well, Kate, I'm afraid that, as they say, to avoid criticism you must do nothing, say nothing and be nothing. And that, my dear, is certainly not the Kate that I've mentored over the years. You'll do fine. You were due for a new start. - Hi, Detective. I really appreciate you coming up here from Cambridge. Considering your past with her, I thought you'd want to know first off. Of course, this will probably end up being in your jurisdiction anyway. - Where did you say you found the purse? - Just on the couch. It's the photos on the wall that are really concerning. Mr. Alvarez, the janitor, found it in here. The purse was right over there. It's at the station now. We're running it for prints. - Tell me everything about your tenant, Mr. Alvarez. - Look, I got 80 tenants here. If they pay their rent, I don't ask any questions. - How did you find the purse? - The guys downstairs had a leak. I came up here to check. - We'll need to see his renter's application. Applications? - He filled out an application, right? - He paid me in cash up front until October. I'm not looking for any trouble. I don't know anything, I swear. - You better try and remember something, If you don't want a visit from the city building inspector, OK? - OK, I'll get right on that. - Wayne, let me know if your people find anything. - You got it. We're gonna keep an eye on things here, see if he comes back. - Lucas, it's probably nothing. - We'll see. - Hey, baby, it's breakfast. Robbie? Robbie, it's breakfast. Hello! Hey, you know the rules. Put that away. It's time to eat. - I'm almost finished! - You can finish that later. - Looking forward to going camping with your dad? - I guess. - It'll be fun. - I don't even like camping. - Sure you do. And you and your dad will get to have some fun together. - Whatever. - You know, I should probably finish getting your things ready before your dad arrives. - Robbie. - Maybe I don't want to spend time with him. You know, if he hadn't left us I would still be in Boston right now with all my friends. - It's not daddy's fault that we left Boston. - No one even asked me. I didn't want to leave. And I don't know any of the kids at this new school. - Look at me. I'm scared too. I don't know anyone at my new school either. - You're not scared. - Well, maybe just a little. It'll be fine, I promise you. What did you get on your shirt? Go upstairs and get changed before your daddy gets here. - He's gonna be here any second. - Really? - Yeah, he phoned and told me to wait out front. I guess so... you know. Great. He's here. - OK, change quickly. I need to talk to your daddy about something. - Where's Robbie? He said he was gonna be ready. - He's gone to get changed. He won't be long. Look, he's having a little bit of a hard time adjusting to everything. - And? - And reassure him that you love him and want him in your life. - Don't start, Kate! Of course I want him in my life. This is all your doing. If he blames me for the breakup of our family, it's because you filled him with that idea. - I haven't filled him with any ideas. - Fine. Whatever. - Look, you know what? We need to be civil to each other. It hurts him that we can't even have a decent conversation. - Kate, you know what? You spent years putting your job ahead of your family, and now you are telling me how to parent? Please. - You're so original. Hey! Give me a hug. - Mom, are you gonna be OK by yourself? - Of course. Have a good time. - Hey, buddy! - Hi, Dad. - Buckle up, kiddo. - How could you do this to us? - There hasn't been an "us" in a long time, Kate. There's just been a "you". - John, please. - You seem so surprised. I guess that's typical. Only aware of your own feelings and needs. - Where is this coming from? - Years of watching you do whatever you need to, to get ahead. And now look at you. Look what you've become. - And what is that? - Tabloid fodder! Your judgement's gone right out the window! You're obsessed with this latest case. You put yourself in the media spotlight with no consideration for me or Robbie. - Do you actually think this is what I wanted? I didn't wish for this! A-a-and you know what? Robbie is just fine. - His mother is being eviscerated in the press! You think he doesn't pick up on that? Yet there you are going out for another interview. When's it gonna be enough? - You're not being fair. I am doing this interview to clear my name. I need you to stand by me right now. - I can't even find you anymore! You think that by running all the time, by working 24-7, you justify your absence in our lives? That we'll forgive you for missing the family dinners and the baseball games because you're out cracking some top story? - How could you say that? - I am not some absentee mother! I am doing the best I can! And I'm going through hell right now and I'm just asking you to support me. You and Robbie are the most important things to me. - I--I just can't do this anymore. - You're punishing me because I'm passionate about my job? - This goes way beyond that. The woman I fell in love with was passionate and ambitious, but about the right things and for the right reasons. You have lost all perspective. You made a choice and people died because of it. The woman I loved, there wouldn't even have been a choice. - Let's get some help. A marriage counsellor. - I don't want marriage counselling. I want out. - So that's it? - Yeah. - My god! How can this be happening? Everything's falling apart. - Goodbye, Kate. I'll pick up the rest of my things next week. - You sure you'll be all right? - I'm from this town. How hard can it be? - OK. I made you dinner. I know you'll forget to eat. It's in the fridge. - You didn't have to do that. Before I forget, the electrician called. He said he came by but nobody answered. I think the doorbell's broken. He'll be back next week. - I'll leave a note on the door, make sure he knocks. - Thank you. Hello? Rosa, I have to go downtown. But you go when you need to go. The police need to speak to me. - Is everything OK? - It's just about that purse that was stolen a few years ago. They say they found it. - That's good, right? - I guess. - I'm almost done in the kitchen. I'll finish Robbie's clothes, then I'm off on holiday. - Have a great trip. Say hi to your daughter for me. - I will. - I don't know what we're gonna do without you for a whole week! - You'll manage. - Call me on my cell if you need me. - Will do. - Ms. Fisher. I'm Det. Sinclair. We spoke on the phone. - Right. Hi. Yours? - Yeah. I can't believe you found it in some apartment after all this time! Well, should I just sign for it? - There's one more thing. We found these in the apartment. We also... found these. - These are from 2 years ago. - You were front-page news 2 years ago. With that Hersog case, you are an automatic target for half the psychos out there. So, while I think you were being watched, we think the threat has passed. - So who was this guy? Who's apartment was it? - We're working on that. - Well, did the landlord get a description of him? - Ms. Fisher, I assure you there's nothing to worry about now. - I can't believe this! Did you find anything else? - Nothing else. Just the purse and what you see there. - And you're telling me not to worry. - When I say we're working on it, I mean we're working on it. Look, I'll send someone over to the house to have a look around. The most important thing right now is for you to be aware and keep your eyes open. All right? - They have pictures of my son in here. - I know. - Thank you. Hello. -It's Rosa. I'm leaving in about half an hour. - OK. Hello? Hello? Hi. - Hi, we cut out. Hold on. There's someone at the door. There's a police officer here. - Wow! That was fast. He'll just want to come in and look around. I'll be there in a few of hours if he needs to speak to me. Have a great trip. - I'll see you in a week. - Bye. - Hello. Come on in. You have 2 messages. Message 1. - Hi, Mom. It's me. I'm calling like you asked me to. Love you. Bye, Mom. - Message 2. -Hi, it's Rosa. I'm at the airport. My flight is on time. Don't forget to eat. I'll see you soon. - End of messages. - My god! Not again! - Hi. - Hi. - Lucas. - Hi, Kate. - Come in. - OK. Thank you. What's with the lights? - No, I didn't have the chance to get the electrician to come by. Um, I've been busy. - Just point me towards your electrical box and I'll have the lights back on in a second. - Thank you. It's downstairs. You can't miss it. It's been a while. - It has. - I'm sorry I haven't called you since I've been back in town. Everything's been a little hectic. - When did you get back? - A couple of weeks ago. Never thought I'd be back in Cambridge. Wasn't part of my 10-year plan. - Yeah, well, 10-year plans have ways of going off course. - All, taken care of. - Thank you. - So, we should talk. Det. Sinclair told you that we'd be by to take a look around the house. - My housekeeper said she showed an officer around earlier. - What's that? - An officer came by earlier. - What time was that? - 4:30, 5:00. I just left the station. - Your housekeeper showed him around. Can we talk to her? - She's visiting her daughter in Chicago. Why? - Hathaway, why don't you find out who that was? - So, I was at apartment where they found your purse. - You know, I can't believe you're still with the Boston PD. - I'm not. I came back here a few years ago. I, um, I guess I wanted something slower. What they say? - Then who was it? - We'll find out. Just look around. So we found this picture. - I don't recognize him. - OK, we also found this article. That was the most recent thing we could find. That and some class schedules from Haskins. - You don't think the man that came by was wearing a police uniform? That was Hersog's M.O. - Hersog died in prison. - No... Yeah, I know. - Look, you don't know who could be responsible for this sort of thing, do you? - After all this time? - The civil suit that the families brought against you, that was dropped, right? - Yes. - OK, and you were appointed at Haskins 3 months ago. OK, look, I'm gonna go through all the recent enrolments, I'll go through administration-- - Am I in danger? What if this guy's a copy-cat of Hersog? - There is no evidence. - All clear. - OK. Look, we're gonna do everything that we can to make sure that you're not in danger. In the meantime, here's my card. Give me a call if you have to. - OK. - Tonight, lock up. - Thanks. - OK. Night. - Thanks. - Kate, it's Lucas! - Aw jeez, Lucas! You scared me half to death. Come in. - I tried calling. I was worried. - Come in. - I thought, um, I'd stick around for a while, keep watch, if you'd like. - Thanks, I'd like that. - I mean, I'm gonna set up a detail tomorrow. - I think everything's gonna be fine. It's just better to be safe. - Yes, of course. - You know, Kate, if someone is digging up this Hersog business in order to scare you it's probably somebody you know. - Yeah, I thought the same thing. I've, been doing some research. This is all from the Hersog case. I started going through everything after you left. - There's a lot here. - Yeah. When the Rose family convinced all the other families to band together to press charges against me, the only way I could face them was by learning everything I could about their daughters. I talked to their friends, their teachers. Look, you have to understand that when Hersog called me to say he had information on the September slayer, I didn't believe it was him. You have no idea how many people phoned in fake tips... ...how many psychos tried to take the credit. - I'm not judging you. - No, I know. I just can't stop judging myself. - OK, you were innocent. You weren't responsible for even one of these girls' deaths. I could've saved her, though. I wanted those interviews. You know, I wanted to catch the September slayer. I thought I'd get a network deal out of it. - Kate, you can't-- - It's true. It's true. I put it on myself. I ran those stupid ads, I set up a hotline for tips. I was cocky. Thought I could be... I don't know, do a better job than the police. And the guy, the actual serial killer, calls me and confesses everything. And I don't give my interview to the police. I don't believe him and he kills another girl like he said he would. and I did nothing. - Kate, you've gotta let it go. - Sure. - What happened after the trial? Well, the frenzy never really died down. My--my husband couldn't handle the bad publicity. He moved out, I lost my job, and I sold the house in 6 months. This teaching position is a new start for Robbie and I. - Must have been hard for him. - Yeah, it was. And what about you? We lost touch a long time ago. - Yeah, a very long time ago. - You wanna see what all the fuss is about? I haven't seen this since the trial. Mr. Hersog-- That--that is your name? So you claim to be involved in the kidnappings and murders of 6 women, right? But with the police working on this case for the past 6 years, why is it that you are not even on their long list of suspects? It's ironic, isn't it? - What is? -You wait so long to be noticed and they won't even honour that. It's as if the police forgot entirely to consider the girls and ask themselves why. -All right, Mr. Hersog. Well, let me ask you. Why? -Do you know what all the girls had in common? -Well, you tell me. What did they have in common? - Turn the question back onto me. Is that what they teach in journalism school? -Maybe. - Are you far sighted? - I notice you squint even though you have your glasses on. -I can't see what that has to do with the murders. -Don't make me spell it out. It's beneath us both. - Well, I looked into your background, Mr. Hersog, and 5 years ago you worked as an optician's assistant at an eyewear shop. -Warmer! -If you are responsible for the girls' deaths, what is the significance of September 8th? -Everyone has had a bad day that ingrains itself in memory. Some people use that day as a measure, reminding themselves that they somehow survived it. And if you think about it, Kate, that bad day becomes a good thing because it represents a hurdle that's been overcome. But I'm not some people. What do you think of when you think of September 8th?, Or September, for that matter? - Early fall, start of school. - Much warmer! -So, why did-- - You OK? - I thought I could do this but I'm not ready. - OK, you're tired. Why don't you go get some sleep? - No, it's OK. Would you like a cup of tea? - Yeah. And this is Robbie? - Yes. He's my rock. - Good-looking kid. - What did I do that made you walk away... from us? - What are you talking about, Kate? We just-- we just grew apart. - You walked out on me with barely a word. - Do you really wanna talk about this? - Well, you never told me why. - You wanted a life that I couldn't give you, Kate. - We never would have lasted. I just pulled the plug before you had to. - Well, you're wrong. - No, I'm not. You outgrew me. We were just kids. - Do you have any idea how lost I was when you left? Did you ever think of that? What? What, we're strangers now? You--you're acting like nothing ever happened between us. - Kate, it's not-- - Just... Just tell me what we should do, Lucas. Because I though I'd-- I'd feel nothing when you landed on my door step. Just tell me. - I still remember the first time I saw you. And I'm still sold. - Why wear a shirt with so many buttons? - I hate buttons. - I feel like a teenager again. - What, your parents aren't coming home are they? - What? - Your parents. - They don't live here! God, I missed you! - Did I outgrow you again? - Very funny. No, I just got a phone call. They found a body. I need to go check it out. - Anything I should know about? - No, just standard police stuff. But look, don't take any chances today, OK? Stay where people can see you while I'm gone. - That'll be easy. I have class today. - I'll hook up with you later as soon as I can. - OK. Bye. Stand clear! - So how long has this guy been here? - I'll know more when I get him back to the lab, but my guess is 8 or 9 days. - Anything else? - No clothes, no ID. Look, I'll need a couple of days to do a proper composite, but your "vic" was male, early 20s, killed by 2 gunshot wounds to the head, burned then tossed in the pond. - What are we looking at in terms of IDing this guy? - I'll do what I can but a sculptural composite of his face is gonna take a couple of days. - Maybe we'll get lucky. - Maybe. - Thanks. So how did things go with the Fischer woman? I heard you found it necessary to give her personal protection. - I'm gonna put a detail on her tonight. - Not what I meant. - Yeah, I know. - A great way to use our stretched resources. I hope you found it worth it. - You know what? That's too far. What's your problem with her? - She got a couple of good cops fired 2 years ago. Now that she needs our help, we're supposed to forget that? - Yeah, that's exactly what we're supposed to do. - Professor! Miss Fischer. I've been waiting for you. - Did you found what you where looking for? - Lovely article on you in the, school paper. - I haven't seen it. - It's very complimentary. I just wanted to see how your lecture plans were coming along. - Fine, thanks. - I feel like we got off to a bad start. - I'm able to let bygones be bygones, and as a peace-making gesture, would like to offer my help should you feel like you were in over your head. After all, you've never actually taught anything before. - Well, how generous. - Yes, well, do take me up on it. - Perhaps one of these days we'll even get the chance to have a drink together. It's a possibility. - Professor Gildon, this is Det. Kelley. - Detective? - Thank you for the kind offer, but I'm gonna have to take a rain check on that drink. - Certainly. - Admirers already? - Are you jealous? - Yes. - So, I checked in on the families of Hersog's victims to see how they're doing, and there's still a few to get back to me. But see these names? These are the students that signed up for your class after that article of you teaching here was printed. - Harold Cortis, Neil Dray, Karen Essex, Collum McTavish. I don't... None of these names ring any bell. - Well, those 4 students are gonna be in your class this afternoon. I've pulled a picture of Karen Essex. But we need to figure out who the other three are. - What about their student IDs? - We're running into a block with the school. Student union won't let us pull pictures without probable cause. But, we'll get around it. - I don't recognize her at all. - I've got an idea for the other three. - Hello, hi. I'm Kate Fischer, and this is Ethics in Journalism. I, I have a questionnaire that I'd like you all to fill out. It's sort of an exercise that I thought we'd try. I'm also gonna hand out this camera. You can take a snapshot of yourself, print it out at the end of class and attach it to your questionnaire. At the end of the semester, we are also going to answer these same questions and see how much we've changed. Hopefully, we'll notice a more positive, informed version of ourselves. If your answers are the same at the end of the year as in the beginning, then you get a refund. Yeah, just kidding. So, the nature of your interview dictates your approach. For example, an in-depth feature requires a different type of interview than a fact-finding piece. But we still need to ask the same basic questions. Anyone else? - I was just going through the syllabus and noticed there's no mention of the Hersog case on it. Seeing as this is Ethics in Journalism, I'm just wondering if you plan to address it. - I do. And it's probably on everyone's mind. It's OK. We should discuss it. Why not next class? - Just one more question. You spent your early career building a reputation as a serious journalist. You covered the October riots in Israel and won an award for the piece you did on the Mumbai bombings. I can't help wonder why you jumped on this September Slayer thing. Didn't it seem like you crossed the line into sensationalist journalism? - Are you saying that a serial killer loose in your own backyard is less newsworthy than a bombing half way around the world? - No, but at what point is it considered entertainment as opposed to journalism? Yeah. - This is a good question. What makes news relevant? It's something every journalist has to think about. Who is your audience and what do they wanna learn about? I personally stand by the fact that 2 years ago everybody watching my show wanted to learn more about the September Slayer than they did about the elections in Pakistan. It's simply because their lives were being affected by the September Slayer. They were afraid. I was afraid. It's a--it's a terrifying thing to realize that there is someone out there, planning to abduct some nameless, unassuming girl. It could have been your daughter, your mother, your sister, your best friend. It was an incredibly important story, but crossing the line into sensationalism? I guess when you stop winning the awards and start making the front page of tabloids you've crossed some sort of line. - Look, it just seems-- - Look, we'll have plenty of time to discuss Hersog and all the other cases that I've worked on, but let's not turn this into an interview on your first day. OK? Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. - Hey, Dr. Harris, thanks for coming. - No problem. - Kate, this is Dr. Harris. He works in Abnormal Psych and been consulting with the police since the original case. - Lucas brought me up to speed. Can I see the image? - Here. From The Book of Hours. Hersog liked it. It's the calendar image for the month of September, and scrawled across the bottom is the Roman numeral number 8. - September 8th. The day Hersog killed all of his victims. - I think someone's sending me a message. - What do you think, Harris? - I agree with Kate. Can I see the questionnaires? So these are the famous 4? - And him, Neil Dray. He was the one that pushed me on the Hersog case today. - I can't help but wonder why you jumped on this September Slayer thing. - Neil Dray. He's 21 years of age. His parents are deceased. He worked at a small newspaper in New Mexico for the last year. - I'd check with the paper. Ask what he was like to work with. - I was just going through the syllabus and noticed there's no mention of the Hersog case on it. - Karen Essex. She went from Psych to Phys-Ed, to Film and to Journalism. It explains her late enrolment. - Even though she's in and out of courses, her grades are strong. and she's involved in extra-curricular activity. I'd think she's just indecisive. - Since this is Ethics in Journalism, I'm just wondering if you plan to address it. - Collum McTavish, first-year student. Spent a year travelling around Asia. - This is interesting. - What? - He doesn't write like a first-year journalism student. - Seem familiar? - No, but none of them do. I mean, could this just be a copycat? - All of this? - Yeah? The pictures, the articles on the wall found in the apartment, the image? It's too orchestrated for it not to be personal. Who's the last one? - Didn't it seem like you crossed the line into sensationalist journalism? -Harold Cortis. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something that's familiar about him. - What do you think? - At the very least, I think whoever is doing this wants to scare you. But I think there's more going on here. Considering your past, it could be one of these 4 students, or I'm afraid it could be any number of people. Yeah? - It's Det. Kelley. - I'll buzz you in. - Hey, Mr. Alvarez. Just wanted to come by and show you a couple of pictures, see if any of these people look familiar. - I don't know. Do you know how many students I rent to here? They all look the same. - Remember my partner? She actually thinks you look pretty good for this. - What? - She looked into your past and there some priors you neglected to mention. So I'll ask you again, Alvarez. Any of those kids look familiar? - No. I--I--I swear. He may have been a bit older, maybe. But I--I don't remember. Honest. What now? - I need your phone. - What? The last caller was 715-555-0156. Press one to be connected. H & H Costumes. - Morton Dunn? - Yes. - Hi. I'm Det. Kelley. We spoke earlier on the phone. - Right, right, right. Um, I found the receipt you were asking about. I've been phoning this guy for over 3 weeks. - Never called you back? - No. He rents 2 outfits and never returns them. See, a police uniform and a clown suit. Said his name was Pete Boyette. - Can I show you some photos, see if any of these... look familiar? - No, I'm afraid none of these seem right. But you know I see a lot of people in a day, so... - Of course. Look, if you, if you think of anything, give me a call, OK? - Sure. - Hold on a second. Hey, there. - Hey. - You're still here, Professor? - I'm just preparing for tomorrow's lecture. - Yeah. No rest for the wicked, I guess. Well, good luck with that. - Early fall, start of school. - Much warmer! -So why did you do it? -I did it because... they didn't see me. - Well, why come forward now? - Because I'm so tired, Kate. And... the school year is just about to begin. - Anything promising? - Two days until September 8th and I'm nowhere near finding out who is doing this to Kate. - From Dr. Ward. She says you owe her. - Thanks. Lucas. We got a problem. - It's the same guy. Which means our stalker is posing as our John Doe. We have to ID this body fast. We've got a murderer out there. OK, we've gotta rush this through the ID system fast. - All right. - And while we're at it, talk to the Captain. We need more men on the surveillance. - You got it. - Lucas, Kate Fischer on line 1. She sounds upset. - Thanks for coming over. - What happened? - I just wanna do what I'd normally do without feeling... I was planning my next lecture and maybe my imagination's running away on me, but I could've sworn somebody was following me on campus. I told John to keep Robbie longer. What's he gonna think about all this? - We don't have to tell Robbie anything. There's nothing for him to worry about. - God! As usual, he didn't listen. Hi, sweetheart! I missed you. - Hi, Mom. - How was it? - It was great! - Yeah? What did you do? - We got to go fishing. - Yeah? - I wrestled wild boar. - Come on! You did not. You're a liar. - OK, I didn't! - Sweetheart, this is Lucas. He's a friend of mine. We grew up together. And he's a policeman. - Really? Cool! - It's good to finally meet you. I've heard a lot about you. I need to take this. Official police business. Excuse me. Det. Kelley. - Hey, Detective. Bart Levenson from The Albuquerque Banner. Got your message. To answer your question, I don't seem to recall a Neil Dray ever having worked here. - Really? Well, he has you down as a reference. Is it possible that he was an intern or someone that wasn't actually employed? - Intern? Well, truth is, Detective, there's only 10 of us on staff as it is. - OK, thank you for your time. - My pleasure. - Sweetheart, why don't you go and brush your teeth? I'll be there in a minute. - OK. There was definitely someone here. And it could've been a woman. - OK, it's a big day ahead of us? Are you ready? - Whatever, I guess. - Well, you'll do great. Your friends are gonna be really nice. I've met your teacher. She's looking forward to meeting you. - We'll see. - Good luck! I'll see you after school. - Because I'm so tired, Kate. And the school year is just about to begin. - Since tomorrow marks the day that each of his victims lost their lives, I thought it would be a good opportunity to discuss what happen. So let's get down to some questions. - Why didn't you think Hersog was the one? - The police held back key information from the public that Hersog never once mentioned to me during the interview. I pushed him to tell me something that only the killer would know and he froze at the question. His name was nowhere to be found on the list of suspects from the police. He had no priors I could dig up. He just seemed wrong for it. - Yeah, but he wasn't wrong for it. He was the killer. And didn't you have an ethical obligation to turn over the DVDs? - It wasn't my interview to turn over. It was the network's. I personally didn't think Hersog was the guy, neither did my bosses. But we were gonna go through the tapes and see if there any information that the police might find useful before we turned them over. Yes? - Did you eventually share all of the tapes with the police? - Yes. Witnesseses or people coming forward with tips are often nervous about talking to the police. So meeting with me was a safe alternative. - And did Hersog ever try to contact you again once he was arrested? - Yes, he did. - Um, what did he say? - He... he said that we weren't all that different from each other. That we were both trying to get noticed. And as far as he was concerned I was looking to make a name for myself off of his actions. Maybe he was right. I thought I was untouchable and could break the case and he thought he was above the law. It's a very powerful role we have as reporters. You know, we can offer somebody that moment of fame, and sometimes at too high a cost. And sometimes I wonder if the killer's desire to expose himself, as for the case with Hersog, isn't just as troubling as the audience's taste for the abnormal. - Isn't that kind of what you were banking on? No offense, but do you really think you conducted yourself ethically? - Look, as journalists, we are obliged to conduct ourselves to the highest standards, and that's what I did. What I want all of you to remember is this: Don't give in to the ratings game. Don't tell sensational stories just to get the biggest crowds. Just make sure you tell good stories. That's all. Thank you. I'll see you at the Dean's BBQ, I hope. - That was tough. - Was it ever! - You did great. - Thank you. I'm sorry. I have to run. I promised I'd pick up Robbie and take him by the party. - Meet your chaperone. It's all clear here. Hathaway, what's your 20? - Covering the West entrance. All clear on my end. - You can tell. It looks like it. - Mom, can I have some cotton candy. - What, sweetheart? - Can I have some cotton candy? - Sweetheart, that stuff should be banned. OK, one bag. - Yes! Can I have the blue? Yep! Well, see you later. - Get me one too, would you please? - Enjoying yourself? Yes, thank you. - And this must be Robbie. I've heard your mom talk about you. Have you tried out for your school's baseball team yet? - How did you know he played? - All little boys love baseball. Isn't that right, Robbie? - Trevor, isn't it? - Detective! Nice to see you enjoying some off-the-clock time with our Kate. - Maybe about time you changed your drink of choice. Wouldn't want to have one of my men have to escort you home. - Ooh! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait up! - Right there, look! I-i-it's Neil he's taking pictures of us. Look. - OK, all right. Hold on. I need someone on the South side. I'm looking for a man, dark hair, with a camera. I need him stopped and I need him held. We'll get him. - Robbie? Robbie! Robbie! - Mom! Mom! Over here! Look, Mom. - Let's get you guys out of here. - It's a good idea. - Neil Dray? - Yeah. Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm Det. Lucas Kelley. I'm with the police department. Mind if I come in? - What is this about? There've been some robberies. I wanted to ask you a few questions. - I'm busy. I'll be careful. - Yeah, Neil... I couldn't help but notice those are some very nice cameras back there. - Thanks. Do you mind? - I'm afraid I do. See, in these robberies, there were some cameras stolen, so unless you wanna do this the hard way, I'll need to come in and grab those serial numbers. - I don't believe this! - Thank you. Wow, Neil! What kind of photos you taking with these? I mean, do any spying? - Look, get your serial numbers and then I would like you to leave. - OK. Do you happen to have the receipts for these? - What, are you serious? - Well, I'd hate to have to take them. - I don't believe this. You know, I don't think you can just take my property. - I can run these and, get back to you. Mel. Hey. Hey, I'm walking out of Neil Dray's apartment. He's got pictures of Kate and the kid all over his computer. He's definitely our guy. I need to bring him in. - All right, stay on him and I'll make some calls. - All right, ASAP please. Look, any word on the body? - We're still waiting for the ID to come in. - Have the Feds take a crack at the picture. We're running out of time. - Sit tight. I'll call you back when I get the OK to bring Dray in. - OK. - Mom? - Yes, sweetheart? - Can I ask you something? - Sure you can. - Why's the police still here? Are we in trouble? - No, we're not in trouble. I don't want you to worry, OK? - OK, Mom. - OK? They're just keeping an eye on us for a while. They'll be gone soon. - OK. - Go play. - Kelley. - Bring him in now. - Not a moment too soon. Get out of the car. - What? - Get out of the car! - What the hell is going on? - I need you to come with me for questioning. Grab your bag. - This isn't about any stolen cameras, is it? - No. - I know my rights! - Try stalking. - What the hell are you talking about? - We'll have plenty of time to talk about-- - Who am I supposed to be stalking? - Kate Fischer. - There's been a misunderstanding. - Sure there has. - I'm serious! I don't know what you think you know-- - Do us both a favour and shut up until we get to the station. - Listen to me! Look, I'm not a stalker. My name is Scott Rooker. I'm a reporter on assignment for the Jersey Chronicle. - Get it-- Get--get-- Over! No! No, no. Go, shoot! - Kate, meet Becky Wade. - Kate. - Lucas, hi. Listen, I think I might have something. There is a girl, Becky Wade, who's interning at the admin office who might be Laura Rose's sister. - I'll check in to it. I'll call you back. We've got a hit. Look up Becky Wade, who may in fact be Sandra Rose, the sister of Hersog's last victim. - I'll call the family. - OK, just find her, all right? - Maybe I can help. Seriously. Listen, I--I've been following Kate. I don't deny it. But if this girl has too, then I'd have a picture of her. - That's her. And I don't think she was working alone. - Shoot! Go around. When's this gonna be fixed? I was at the best part! - I need you to come with me. I have to talk to the police officer. - Fine. I'm gonna get my mini player from the car. - Grab your thing, sweetheart. Officer, I need to get a message to Lucas. - Now it's time we play. Put your hands behind your back. Put your hands behind your back! That's it. We gonna go for a little walk now. - Here it is. - Quickly. Move it. Let's go! That's it. Walk a little faster, why don't you? We gonna go downstairs and have a little fun. That's it. Keep moving. Good. Good girl. That's it. Don, line 2. - Lucas, I'm getting no response from the patrol car at the Fischer house. - Try again. I'm not getting any answer at Kate's either. Can we get Hathaway out there now? - You try to run again and next time I'll shoot you instead of the wall. Now move! And you're gonna walk on! Wait till you see what we snuck in while you were gone. - Hello, Kate. - Now sit. Sit down in the chair. Sit. - I'm gonna tie your hands behind your back. See? You're gonna get your own bracelet. - What do you want from me? - Is the camera on? - Camera's on. - Well, you're getting the whole Hersog treatment tonight. - What? - Thanks to modern technology we're gonna broadcast your death on the Internet. We just need to do a few things first. - I know who you are. You're--you're Sandra Rose, right? - Well, give the lady a prize. We'll let you go if you can tell me who he is. Really. Scouts honour. You can leave. I'll give you 5 seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Times up. - I don't know who he is. I'm sorry. - It's too bad, Kate. It's the only chance you'll get. - 911. What is your emergency? -Please help. They have my mother. And I heard a gun shot. - What is your name? - Robbie Benedict. - Where are you calling from? - 20 Woodland Road. - Robbie? Robbie, can you hear me? Robbie? - You said your son wasn't home. - It's not my son. It's--it's... - Go get him. - Aye, aye. - You see, one thing I learned when I was in the hospital is that everyone lies. They promised they could help me be normal again and look how that turned out. So now, I don't believe you. - Come on out. Robbie, it's OK. You see, I'm one of the good guys. I'm with the cops. I'm with the police. It's OK. - We just got a call from Robbie Benedict saying his mom is being held. And still no response from the patrol car. - All units at the Fischer residence now. - All right. - Come on, Kate. - Let's go. Get up. Come on up. Let's go, buddy. Follow me. We gonna go see your mom now, all right? That's it. Just right down here. Good. - Mom! - Hi. - Are you OK? - I'm OK. Just gotta be quiet, OK? - You lied to us, Kate. And here we've been so patient. Come here, Robbie. Wow, you've grown up so much! - Mom! - Just do whatever you want to do to me, Just don't hurt him, OK? - Got you! Why would I do that? Who am I, Becky? Tell her. - He's the tin man. No heart. OK, Robbie, let's play. I'm going to put this blindfold over your eyes. - Do you know what the best part is? Is that you should've guessed who I was. You see this guy? Right there. It's me. Laura and I were supposed to get married in the fall. - You're Anthony. I'm so-- I'm sorry. - Sorry? You're sorry? Yeah. Yeah, you're gonna be very sorry, actually. Question for you: Um, are you squeamish? Cause, this is gonna hurt... ...a lot. - No sign of Roger and Hancock. Activity in the house though. I saw a suspect look out the window. Looks like the power was cut. - All right, everyone, move out. - Can you see me? - What did you do to me? - This is your fault, you know. You know, you didn't deserve a second chance. And then you get a job lecturing people? What do we get? You see, we're the deserving ones here, not you. - Look, I know I didn't recognize you before, but I--I remember how-- how sad you were when you lost her. - The Book of Proverbs says the Lord hates 6 things: The first is haughty eyes. The second, a lying tongue, and the third are hands that shed innocent blood. We're going to purge you of each of these things so you can be pure again. - The camera just loves you. - I have a partial view of the east-side basement window. I see the female "vic" tied to a chair. Two "perps", no sign of the boy. Male "perp" has a handgun. - Until I have visual confirmation that the boy is safe, I want no shots fired, all right? You hear that? No shots? I'm gonna try and make contact. - Hello? - Hi, this is Lucas. I'm with the Police Department. Everything's under control out here. Is everything all right in there? - Yes, everything's fine. - Becky. Can--can I call you Becky? - Sure, you can call me whatever. - I understand there's a little boy in there. I want to help you. I know you didn't want to harm him. Can you help me get him out? - Why should I help you? - All right, now open your mouth! - Run, Robbie! Run, baby! - Don't let him get outside. Now why did you do that? You've made a huge mess! - We've got something. It's Robbie! - Benson, move in! Move in! - Robbie, over here! Come on, come on, come on! Stay down, stay down. - Anthony! Anthony, can you hear me? - Hold fire. I'm going in. - All right, everyone stand down and wait for my word. - If anything happened to him... - Listen, Becky, please just let me go. I'll do whatever you want. I'll move away. I won't bother you anymore. - I haven't-- I haven't seen this in so long. - You look so happy together. - Why do you have all these? - I wanted to get to know her. - You'll never know her. She was my sister, my best friend. - I know. I know. I just wanted-- - Stop talking. Now Kate... thanks for playing along, but, it's time we bring this thing to an end. My god. Please! - Kate, it's me. - Lucas! Where's Robbie? - He's upstairs. He's good. - They put something into my eyes. It's starting to wear off. - It's OK. It's gonna be OK. Just wait here. I'll be right back. Don't move. - Lucas! - It was very sweet of your boyfriend to try and save you. - What did you do to him? - You keep getting people into trouble. - Lucas! - Kate! - I hit her! She's unconscious. - OK, get out of here. I'll be right behind you. - Robbie? - Mom! Mom! Go, go, go! - Baby! Clear! - I'm so sorry. B team, upstairs! - Let me see you. You're in one piece? I'm so sorry, my love. - Kate. - Thank you. - Tell me when you guys are cued. and I want to get the house in the back of the shoot, got it? - Thanks, Richard. In this house that you see behind me, Kate Fischer and her son Robbie had been held hostage for hours before being rescued... Closed captions: Vision Globale
