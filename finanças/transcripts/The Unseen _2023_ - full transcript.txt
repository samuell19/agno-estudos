Then you select whichever package you want and you stitch. Kali, you could be resourceful and help. I-- I am! I'm teaching others how to transition between video clips. That's not essential. Get out of here with that. Come on. I'm actually a famous influencer. I have almost 15,000 followers. I have over 15,000 followers. Well, what do you have? Like, three? Maybe you can influence your followers to help set the table then? Considering you live here rent free. Only for another month. I'm about to move on campus. Yeah. R-- remind me, uh, who's paying for that... campus housing? Tuition? Well, at least I don't live at home after college like you. I graduate law school in two weeks. You, on the other hand, are completely dependent on Mom and Dad. Correct? -But, you know, when I'm 25-- -Objection. We're not talking about when you're 25, we're talking about right now. The defense rests, your honor. Yeah, funny. To that point, counselor... how's your job search going? I have to pass the bar first, Mom. Well, you know your dad's gonna want you to have a job lined up before the bar and graduation. -If you want his help-- -D-- I don't. Hey, why aren't you guys watching the news right now? Why? There's cops and reporters everywhere on our street. -It's fucking-- -Oh, L-- Lindsay. -Frickin' ridiculous. -What happened? Someone got murdered. - On our-- on our street? - Yeah. I thought we lived in, like, the safest area. - The victim... - In Chicago, people get murdered every day. ...was found in her bedroom and pronounced dead at 6:00 this morning. - Holy shit. - Oh, my God. Oh, Barbara. Barbara? Dr. B., remember? Oh, yeah. She used to hand out full-size candy bars on Halloween. How sad. Take a security guard who sneaks off for a smoke. He leaves his post unmanned, allowing a murderer into the building unchecked. How do we define who's at fault? Is the security guard ultimately responsible for the death? Or the murderer? Tom? A-- are you with us, Tommy? Yeah. Sorry. I'd love your take on this topic. To me, it seems like... Palsgraf would be a good example here. Um... When the suspect brought the-- um, the bag of explosives onto the-- onto the train, uh... uh, it's found to be an independent act of negligence and supersedes negligence on the employee or the company, um, which breaks the chain of causation. I meant in regards to criminal cases, not civil. And I certainly hope on the exam when you answer questions, you give more concise answers. Don't just regurgitate the court's opinion. I, uh-- I am not simply regurgitating opinion. It's the law. Palsgraf establishes a clear precedent of causation. Using big words doesn't necessarily make you right, son. I bet "nepotism" is one of those big words. Fuck off. Back up, Bryce, the guy can barely even walk right. Go catch a dick, Kelsey. All right, all right. Let's just calm down here. Okay? Tommy, that was a valiant effort. I'm sure you must feel some pressure having your dad as the guest lecturer. All right, I think we are done for today. Let's all thank Mr. Olson for giving us his time, please. Thank you. Must be tough being Dan Olson's progeny. You have no idea. Yeah? Maybe this will help. I'm, uh... -Um... -Are you okay? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm Olivia. -Tommy. -Nice to meet you. I-- I haven't seen you here before, uh... That's because I usually hide in the back row, so... Well, um, after today, I might be doing the same. So, uh, Jude and Teel, huh? Hey. Leave me alone, Dad. Look, I did what any judge would have done if you brought up Palsgraf in a criminal trial. Just trying to help you. Let me do you a favor. I don't need your help. You wouldn't be in this law school if it wasn't for my help. Look, I talked to your professor. You make it to class and that's half the battle, but you can't be falling asleep in class if you expect to get picked up by one of the top firms. Don't worry. I won't be asking you for a recommendation letter. With that attitude, you won't be getting one. Get your shit together. Oh, hey! -Hey. -Thank you again for today. Are we still on for next week? -Yeah. Absolutely. -Great. Looking forward to it. Absolutely. Hey. -Kelsey, right? -Yes, hi. - You can call me Dan. - Dan, okay. Hey, look, let's talk about, uh-- let's talk about the law. Mmm... Mmm... Mmm, mmm, mmm. You graduate in May? Uh, yes, ma'am. -Uh, Pritzker Law. -I can read. Bar exam in July I presume? Uh, yes, ma'am. So, why us? Uh, well, I got your information from a classmate in school, and after doing my research, I-- Allow me to rephrase. You're Dan Olson's son. With his recommendation, you could work anywhere. Yeah, I mean, why us? You already have an in to the largest firm in the city. Well, yes, my father's firm is... very successful... I prefer to follow my own path. If you wanted to pave your own path... why would you pursue criminal law like your father did? Well, it was the area in school I found most interesting, and two, um, per Gideon Wainwright, uh, everyone has-- A right to counsel. What is your point? I want to help people. I-- I wanna help the innocent. And if they're not? - Not what? - Innocent. Well, I will do everything that I can to make sure justice is found for my client. That's my job. You know what? I respect that, kid. This could work. Especially with our unfinished business. We're bringing someone on to work older, ongoing splinter cases. Low pay, long hours, could be a good place for a new hire to show initiative. I have a case in mind, actually. With all due respect, um, Miss Jude-- Ms. Jude. I'm married to the firm. Right, uh, Ms. Jude... I was kind of looking for something with a little more... Higher paying? Uh, correct. You think if I give you some dusty history book case from ten years ago, it won't be the cutting edge of what you've been studying? That you'll get lost in a backroom somewhere with no opportunities to show us the value you can bring? I didn't want to quite say it like that, but, uh-- Cold cases are old, yes. And tough to conclude, especially since everyone who came before you has failed. Families will get closure... and you will be the one to help them. You think you can handle the pressure? Hey. Are you listening to me? Tommy? Are you listening to me? Tommy! Tommy! Tommy. Are you listening to me? Oh, uh, thank you. Thank-- thank you for your time and I-- I look forward to your email. Uh, Jane... Can I talk to you for-- for a second? Sure, sure, sure. Just give me one second. Just please stop typing for, like, five seconds. I have deadlines. I don't want to crack down. It just feels like you're not even trying to listen to me. -I'm telling you-- -You're telling me what? -I'm t-- -Olivia, if this is like that shit you told me-- Jane, I'm-- I'm seeing things and-- and-- and no one believes me. You've been saying this for weeks. Out of all the fucking people, Jane, really? Really? - You don't believe me? - I-- - You don't-- - I do believe you. I just think-- I think you need some rest, okay? You have been burning the candle at both ends. I-- -Hey! -Jesus, Olson. Watch out. Bryce, what the fuck are you doing here? Stealing your job, daddy's boy. Fucking Bryce. She has three hemorrhages, two contusions. Doctor, what do you wanna do? Jesus Christ. Ellie could survive this. Call it. Dr. Sims... I've seen traumas like this before, she's at 30% best. Even if we work all night to try to keep her stable, she's gonna be crippled. Barbara. I'm on my small break. Hello. Hello? Yeah. This-- this is, uh, Thomas Olson. How can I help you? Oh, hey. Um... Yeah, uh, that-- that sounds amazing, um... Uh, you wanna-- you wanna bring me on? Um... Is there an offer I'll-- I'll receive? Hello? Hello? - Tommy. - Oh! Hey. Quit your daydreaming. You get your first trial by fire. Time to meet the big boss. Yeah, uh, I actually need to talk to her about the terms of my position. Uh, you know what? I don't actually think she's in right now, um, but you can wait in the conference room until she arrives. Great. Hey, by the way, uh, who is the girl in the photo, um? She looks familiar. The associates? Rookie, it's day one. You'll get there someday. -You coming? -Yeah. And this is the conference room. -Nice. -Yeah. Uh, Kristen should be here shortly. Okay. -See you around? -Yeah. Tommy. -Make yourself comfortable. -Oh, thank you. -Not there. -Oh, um, excuse me. Thank you for this opportunity. I have your paperwork to sign so you can start right away. I'm hiring you on to help with our workload. I'll need you to start taking assignments. You, uh-- you mean cases? Uh, yeah. Uh, who will be my supervisor? Are you saying you don't want the job? No, no, I-- I'm not saying that. I definitely want the job. Then sign. Um... Uh, I'm assuming, uh, there are benefits? Of course we have benefits. Many of them once you finish and kill. Wait, what-- what did you say? Once you bill. As in bill each client? Oh. Yeah. I'm late for a conference call. Let me show you to your office. When do I, uh, start? Now. Here you are-- the dungeon of success. This will be where you'll spend your days and probably many nights. Oh, I'm-- I'm used to long hours. My dad comes home at all hours of the night. -Liv, I made your favorite. -Oh! Bok choy tonight. Yay! Can't wait. I fucking hate bok choy. Uh, she cooks for you? Yeah. Only on Thursdays when I'm actually home. -Are you two rel-- -Adopted. Ah. But don't think I didn't earn this position. No, no, I am not one to talk. I am sure you're very good at your job. I am. I, uh-- I got a job today. That's wonderful. Yeah, Tommy, that's really awesome. Well, does that mean you're gonna move out soon? - Kali. - Yeah, Kali. Not nice. But seriously, the way the sun comes into your room is perfect for my sun salutations. Which firm? Kirkland and Ellis? Mackenzie? You know, I-- I didn't, um, reach out to either one of those. Those are the only two you should be looking into. I mean, if you had half a brain, you'd let me make two phone calls and I can get you the best damn firm in this town. You know, I haven't even told you the fucking firm's name yet and you're already judging my poor decisions. Tommy, he is not judging you. Your father's trying to help. Yeah, he's not trying to help me. - He's trying-- - All right. Which one is it? Jude and Teel. Nice, bro, I'm glad it worked out for you. I closed around our house today. You didn't tell me that. You never asked. Did you even apply to any of the firms I recommended? Dad. He got a job. You should be proud of him. I would be proud of him if he got hired by a real law firm. We did not send you to school for you to work for some third-rate firm like Jude and whatever the fuck it is. You know, nothing's ever good enough for you. It-- it's not the right firm, it's-- it's not Kirkland and Ellis, you know, I am sorry. I am-- I-- your crippled son fell again. - Honey-- - Run to your room, loser. - Dad! - Dan. When you make the money, you make the rules. Otherwise, sit there and eat your fucking food. You don't have to be so harsh. - Eat your fucking dinner. - Dan. Kali! Kali! What? What the hell? -What the hell, Tommy? -Did you do this? -What are you talking about? -Look at the mirror. Did you do this? Guys, what is all the yelling? -Some people are sleeping. -So stupid. Look at-- look at the mirror! - I did not do anything-- - Look at my hand. No one said you did anything. Why are-- -No, there's tons of blood. -I was just trying to sleep. There was blood. There was-- - Tommy. - Well, did-- did you see it? There's nothing there, Tommy. You're fine, Tommy, you're fine. See what? Your face? Your face is-- Look at my-- Your hands look completely normal, okay? - You just need to get to bed. - Enough. You're stressed, you're stressed. I mean, it was-- it was there. Honey, it was a bad dream. No, there's nothing there. You're fine, okay? -Can we just go back to bed? -Get back to bed. Come on. Let's go to bed. Come on. Please. 25 years old and still having goddamn childhood nightmares. Damn it! Honey. Not now, Meredith. This is your fault. I-- I'm-- I'm sorry? You're sorry? You're sorry? I'm sorry. Out of whiskey. I'll go out and get some. Not this late you won't. Well, I-- I drive at night all the time when you're away. You're not going nowhere. Understand me? You're right. -You're right. -Good. Would you hit a shot? What a joke. God. Let's go, let's go! Jesus Christ. What the fuck are you doing here? The fuck are you gonna do with that? How is the first assignment going? Well, I'm-- I'm just reviewing some of these documents. Uh, is-- is there anything in particular that I should be looking for? Old cases that never got resolved. We've hit dead ends for years because... as lawyers, we are bound to ethical practices. You, on the other hand, haven't taken the bar, so... technically, you're not a lawyer yet. Well, e-- excuse me. Are you asking me to do something unethical? I would never ask you to do that. I just know you'll do whatever it takes to be successful here. I need you to give me a summary on all the witness accounts of the unresolved cases. I'll be in my office but only till 6:00. Why? Why? Why? Why? What? Something... I think I found something interesting. Uh, the cases you gave me, uh, four of them happened in River Oaks. And, uh, after doing a little discovery, I found that the maid that was poisoned might have been involved in a kidnapping, um, of young women. I found a-- a photo of her with one of the victims. Uh, and also I-- I found this. Um, I think it might be worth reopening and turning it over to, uh, detectives. Great work. I am interested in your take on the other files, particularly the hit-and-run case. Um... That one, uh, really didn't have much to go on... ...informational, uh, wise. But, um, but it appears to be that the, uh-- the v-- the victim's file, uh, is missing. I don't want you distracted with the big picture. I need you to focus on who was driving the SUV. Uh, yes, ma'am. Hey, Tommy. Jane's on a diet, but I'm still gonna grab some grub at Jim and Pete's. You want to tag along? Uh, yeah. Oh, well, um... maybe not, I-- I think I've-- I think I just stumbled onto something. Yeah, I promise you can trip over it again once you get back. Your epiphany's not going anywhere, but my Tesla is, so. -Tesla? -Mm-hmm. I guess you don't have to worry about gas. You know, you just started here. So you haven't been introduced to the two main facts of working here. Oh, which are? One you get to set your own hours and lunch. - And two? - And two, Jim and Pete's has the best cheesy bread. Wow. - You weren't kidding. - I know, right? It's got, like, ten layers of cheese on it. -So good. -Monstrous. Like that box of files Kristen gave me. I saw that. She gave you the baptism by fire. But you seem to be ripping through it pretty fast though. Yeah, I-- thanks I-- I guess. You know, I just can't help but feel like if those poor bastards had Google, they could have figured it out themselves. I'm not so sure about that. It takes a keen eye. You know, this job isn't for everyone. It takes a toll, you know what I mean? Yeah, I-- I guess. It's just crazy to think... Bryce was just interviewing for my job, and now he's sitting in a morgue. So were your two friends? No, no. He-- he was a-- he was a huge asshole. Even in high school. Stupid thing. Do you need help? Yeah. Mine gets stuck like that all the time. I think these lockers are from, like, 1812. Thanks. I like your backpack. Yo, what the fuck, man? You're really gonna help this weirdo? Yo, come on, Bryce. 'Cause if you do, people might start calling you Hoppy Tommy again. Hoppy Tommy and Mouse Milly. You two freaks are perfect for each other. Yeah, well, what did she ever do to you? Like, can you just lay off? Look at the loser falling for his little girlfriend? -I'm so sorry. -No, I'm-- I'm fine. Bryce is a huge dick. Um, are you okay? It's-- it's fine. Just a little blood. I'm Milly. Tommy. Tommy, do you like the rain? I don't really know anyone that likes rain. Well, now you know somebody who does. The only person that liked Bryce was Bryce. Sounds like it was pretty rough when you were younger, huh? Um, that's how I remember it. But nothing that endless breadsticks can't fix. Or a delicious bite of cheesy bread? Yeah. Should we be worried? What do you think? Kali. Kali. Kali. Kali. Kali. Jesus! Sorry. What happened to your face? No, I-- I'm fine. - Where's Kali? - I don't know-- Why are you guys in my room? Why are you wearing my clothes? I have one, too. Oh, my God, did you fuck a mountain lion or something? I-- I-- I just was-- You look like shit. You should definitely take a Xanax. Oh, yeah. That's what my friends do. Yeah, your friends are hardly normal. Tommy, let's-- let's get you cleaned up, okay? No, look, I'm-- I'm fine. You're not fine. You have scratches all over your face. - Linds-- - Tommy, just let me-- - I'm fine. - It'll help the swelling. Look, it's gonna hurt, but hold. It's cold, I know. Morning, I got some fresh bagels, I made eggs. Scrambled, of course, you know, I can't-- Honey, what happened? I'm fine. Ah, it looks worse than it is. I told him not to go drinking last night, but... You went out last night? I didn't even hear you leave. Look, Mom, I-- I've had a really rough night, and I... I just want something to drink and go to work. You know, now I'm concerned about you for a different reason. Your father is worried as well. We just don't think this firm is the best thing for-- Well, it's a good thing you two don't work there. You started this job two days ago, and it is obvious to me that it is having a negative impact on your mental and physical health. You're-- you're not sleeping enough, you're not eating, and now you come home with cuts all over your face? Mom, it's not the job that's the problem, Mom. It's Dad. I can't stand to live here anymore. And I... I-- I-- I don't know how you stand it either. Please show some respect, you two. -I do! -I do show respect. That's all I've done my whole life, and now he makes me feel like I'm not worthy enough to be Dan Olson's son. Tommy, that is not true, okay? He loves you. He loves you. He loves nothing. Tommy, he loves our family. -He loves this family. -Mom, just stop. - He loves our family! - Mom. Mom. Listen to me. Stop. I'm gonna go talk to him. Just stay here. Tommy. Tommy, wait up. Tommy. Sorry about Mom. She's just trying to help. Well, she's not. What is it? I'm late for work. Look, she's a mom. She's supposed to be worried, it's her job. Oh, God, Tommy, you need a new bandage. - I'm fine. - Look... I want you to call him. - Dr. Gunderson? - He helped me. When? When we were kids. You're probably too young to remember. Things I don't want to remember about our parents. You know, I have gone entire sessions where people don't say a word. You don't have to talk if you don't want to. I'm happy to just share this time. I don't know how this is supposed to work, so-- Well, all right. How about we start with... what can I do for you? Well, I've-- I've been having these nightmares, and I just kind of want you to, um... just... pull them out of my memory or-- or get me to forget, or I-- I don't even know, help. Okay, um... It sounds like you've experienced some trauma. I don't know. Um, maybe, I... Well, uh, perhaps instead of trying to forget things that happened, we should help you remember things you've locked away so we can work through them. My sister said that you could help me. Ah, yes. Lindsay, right? Yes. Well, then, with your permission... I'll just ask you a few questions, and perhaps we can get a deeper understanding into what's on your mind. Well... yeah, uh, um, sure. Um, what do you have to do? Like, wave a watch or something, um-- Just don't tell me you, like, it's count back from ten or some breathing yoga thing. No, not exactly. I'm gonna ask you three questions... while you listen to this metronome. Should-- should I close my eyes? It's up to you. I'm just going to ask you about a moment with someone who hurt you, a moment with someone you hurt, and a moment with someone who made you feel safe. Easy. Calm down. It's okay. Jesus, son, you're ice cold. Some-- some-- some-- someone hit her. Hey, slow down, easy. Who hit who? Are you in trouble? I-- I-- I don't know. I don't-- I don't know what to do. We-- we were walking on the street and then-- and then she was gone. - Who was gone? - The girl. The girl. We have to call the-- What girl? The girl from school. Did anybody see you? I-- I-- I don't know. I-- I-- She-- she-- she said-- I-- I just left her. Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, it's gonna be okay. You're not getting in any trouble, all right? All right? We have to call the police. It's you and me, son. Anything bad happens, you always talk to me first. Can you see me? I'm sorry, Tommy, I don't think I can help you. And I would like you to leave, please. What do you mean? We just started. I-- I-- I am not comfortable. -I-- -Dr. Gunderson, please. I can't treat you. What do you-- what do you mean? Good luck. Please. Leave. Tommy. - Hey. - Hi. Yeah, don't mind me, I'm just admiring your board here. So, did you find the Zodiac Killer? Not yet. Oh, mm. Oh, my God. This place is crazy. Jesus. I like to think of it as organized chaos. Organized chaos? Yeah, Kristen don't do that. Look, I can't even read this. Well, I mean, it's not really meant for anyone else but me. No, you work at a firm now. Anything you say or do can and will be used against you. I appreciate the Miranda. Welcome to the club. Hey, detective. - Hey. - Got some more for you. Making any headway on the hit-and-run? Kind of. I, um... I recently found out that the doctor that made the report was a Barbara Simms. Uh, I saw her on the news. She had been murdered. Great. Guess we won't be able to re-interview her. Tommy, you okay? These cases are-- Tommy, what the hell are you doing? You're not gonna tell anyone, are you? No, I won't... if you give me a hit. I didn't know you smoked. Here. You don't. You don't smoke, do you? Aren't you worried about the staff finding out? No. Nobody cares. Neither do I. Having a bad day? I just needed something to take the edge off. Oh, I am not fucking okay. I think I recognized that girl in the photo. The one in the hallway? No, the one on her desk. Wait, you-- you told me on my first day that you-- you didn't see anything? Yeah, I-- I acted like I didn't see anything because nobody would believe me. Jane thought I was fucking crazy. Do you know who she is? Of course I do. She was the one I replaced. Damn. Fuck, what the fuck is going on? We have some more somber news in regards to the ongoing murders... It's like The Purge out there. Yeah, tell me about it, you try selling a home in this murder market. Tommy, will you take this jacket off so I can iron it? It's like you slept in it. My name is Kit Cabello... Your hair's a mess. - Mom, stop. - Guys. Trying to listen. Brutal discovery this morning as a man identified as Owen Moxley was found decapitated underneath a vehicle in his auto repair shop. I don't know, Kit, this stuff is really getting scary and brutal. What do you make of all of this? As reports are still coming in, we want to let everyone know that there was at least 100 stolen catalytic converters, and, with some new evidence coming in as well, there's shows of evidence of forged... Do you guys know him or something? No, no, I'm just taken aback by how horrific it is. In the meanwhile, everybody, just take care of yourselves and each other. Uh, let's change the channel, okay? Moxley was acquitted from the chop shop case. And he knew Kristen and-- - Tommy? - Oh, uh, hey. I-- I didn't-- didn't hear you, uh-- It's okay. You're obviously distracted by your work. Yeah. No, you're-- you're not gonna believe this, but, uh... your mom used to work with my dad. What are you talking about? What are you-- Tommy! Tommy, are you okay? I'm-- I'm-- I'm good. I'm-- I'm-- I'm good. - It's okay-- I'm-- I'm here. - I'm sorry-- No, uh-- -I-- I'm-- -Are you okay? Sorry. Uh, I'm-- - What is-- - No, I'm-- I'm-- I'm good. You know, everybody keeps saying they want to help me, and-- and-- and it's making me feel like I'm going crazy. You know, I-- I keep having these nightmares, and they-- they feel so-- so real-- and I'm-- I'm seeing things. It's like you're in the driver's seat. But someone has your arms down... and has a crushing grip on your throat. Yeah, my grandma used to say that dreams and nightmares have the same people in them. We must make Dad happy. Dad? -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you okay? -Yeah. I'm sorry, I-- I just haven't been myself lately. No, it's-- it's okay. It's okay. I'm-- I'm-- I'm here. And, look, we're-- we have each other's back. -Right? -Yeah. Everything's gonna be okay. Tommy? Tommy? I'm sleeping. Clearly, you're awake if you're responding. Tommy, I just want to make sure you're okay. Why, um... Why-- why did you lie? Why-- why didn't you tell me that you and dad knew Kristen? Did-- did she-- did she work for him? I-- At dinner, you two made it seem like this was just some-- some crappy little law firm, but that's not-- that's not true, is it, Mom? Tommy, the truth is complicated. - Complicated? - Yeah, it's complicated and I wish-- I wish that I could tell you... but I can't, so, um, all you need to know is that I love you, okay? Well, I-- I love you too, Mom, but I am-- I-- I-- I'm-- I'm done with this, you know? I, um, yeah, I'm gonna go to bed. Come on, motherfucker, do you know who I am? Hey, it's gonna be all right, son. Take care of this for me, will you, Sheriff? Always do. Another suspected murder in a suburb of Chicago. More details coming up. ...once again grips our small town as a brutal beating turned drowning has taken another life. The victim has been identified as our long-time standing law official, Sheriff Victor Evans. The color of the vehicle? Like, it was pouring. Like, it was like a black Escalade or something. Did you get a good look at the driver? - I, uh-- - Hey, Jeff. Why don't you grab some lunch. I got this. Thank you, sir. Hi. Sheriff Evans. So-- You said, black Escalade? - Yes. - Okay. Gotcha. Where were we? Hey, Tommy. How are you doing, champ? Are you okay, kid? A-- a-- a family emergency. I have to go. Yeah, sure. - Sorry. - Uh-huh. - Hey. - Hey, uh, Liv. Do you know what's going on with Tommy? Uh, yeah. Yeah, actually, I-- I do. Well, would you mind filling me in? Because the kid needs help. He just ran out of here like he saw a ghost or something. I-- you know, Kevin, I'm sorry, but I-- I just don't think you'd understand. Excuse you? But he does need help. Where-- where-- where's Lindsay? - I don't know, freak. - Where is she? Hey, what the hell, asshole? -Look, someone... -Give that back. ...is trying to kill me. Okay, and I'm gonna kill you if you don't give me my phone. What's going on in here? I don't know, Tommy's on his period. All right. Get out. Both of you. Out. Look, I-- I just-- I need a minute. I need-- I need a place where I-- I-- I feel safe. Tommy, you seriously need to calm down. You're waking up in the middle of the night, leaving, sneaking out of the house, making noises in your room. You're falling apart. Look, I am falling apart! You know, you-- you say-- you say that I-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm sneaking out, like I-- I-- but that's just it. I don't remember. There are-- are... gaps in my memory. Okay, so you have amnesia. That is not what I'm saying. May-- maybe it is. Okay. Okay. So, you admit it. Tell me where you're going at night. -Like, what are you doing? -I don't know. - It's drugs, isn't it? - What? No. -No. -I'm not gonna tell mom and dad. No, it's not drugs! Did you even call that doctor I recommended? Tommy, you look at yourself, you have all this pent-up anger. You're yelling at Mom, you're-- I am coming to you. I-- I'm coming to my sister. I-- I can't trust anyone, and-- and... you know, I-- I've-- I've tried. I've tried. You know, and... You know, I did-- I did what you told me to do! It didn't work. It's okay. Barbara... and Sharon... Bryce. I killed them... didn't I? I killed them. I'm-- I'm-- I'm going to go to jail. Do you remember the carousel? Remember that black, white crazy hat that I wore? Oh, yeah. I wanted to ride the horse into the sunset. And do you remember what you said to me? "Just hang on. -Hang on till the end." -That's right. And that's what I think you should do. Just hang on. Just hang on. I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you. How? I don't know. But what I know... you're going to be okay. I promise. Look... why don't you clean yourself up? Splash your face... and we'll talk through it together. 911. What's the emergency, please? What are you doing? - Nothing. - Who are you calling? I was just gonna charge my phone. Who are you calling? Were you calling that doctor? No! What? Tommy! What the fuck-- Come on, Tommy! Tommy, what the hell is wrong with you? Lindsay, Lindsay! Lindsay, are you okay? O-- Olivia, some-- something just something just happened to me. Tommy. It's happening to Dad. - Dad? Where are you? - Tommy? What do you want me to see? What is it? What's going on? Come down here, -I'll show you. -Hello? Hello? Mom? Mom? Mom? Hey. Mom, where are you going? Shit. Mom? Come back. Tommy? Tommy? Guys! Let me in! Mom! Mom, Tommy! Lindsay-- Lindsay's really hurt. Please, help! Mom. Tommy. I'm so glad you're here. Please help. I need your help. Wai-- wait. Support your goddamn mother down here. We think she's high on drugs. I need to talk to Tommy! I need to talk to Tommy! - Please be careful. - Olivia. You-- you know this woman? Yeah, I-- I-- I work with her. Son, call the cops. Wait, no, it's-- Where did that little bitch go? I have a story to tell. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Um, sorry. Sorry. Hey, freak. No weirdos allowed. Everybody else in school was invited. Well, nobody wants you here. So, how about we take a vote? Hey, Bryce. You really shouldn't talk to her like she's dirt. I'll talk to her however I want. You know what, forget it. Let's go to my place. Yeah, let's go. But, Bryce, it's raining. I don't care about the rain. Little rain never slowed anybody down. Let's go. All right. Let's do it. Wait! I don't wanna walk home alone either. Um, yeah. Sure. Bryce, where the fuck is Tommy? Who gives a fuck about Tommy? Do you have any beer at your house? Of course I have beer. Ah, shit! Bryce, it's raining, come on! Hey, wait. Oh, my God, I can't believe this. Here. Fetch. - Bryce, come on. - Tommy, let's go. You don't have to go with them. I gotta go. Fine. Fuck you then! Fuck you! - Get up. - No! Get off me! You better listen to me, boy. You-- you need to listen to me. I saw everything. You did this. The hell are you talking about? That-- that-- that day in the rain. When-- when I-- when I came to your office. Excuse me, boy? You heard me. You're the damn problem. You're bringing drug addicts into the house, living off my dime. You know, it's always about money with you. I'm sorry that I'm a failure, that I didn't live up to the Dan Olson dream. I don't even know who I am anymore! You're my son. I'm not your son. You're ashamed of me. I did it for my family. Please don't. Dan, don't. You both never know when to stop. You just stay out of this. You are a fucking disgrace. Well, you're a murderer. You killed--- you-- you killed that girl! And you-- and you paid the sheriff and the mechanics to just-- to just cover it up! You lied to me. I-- I came-- I came to your office to-- to-- for your help. Not for this! You did this. You-- you made me a criminal. -I lied to you. -You did it for yourself. I did it for your mother. She was driving, not me. -Mom, is this true? -Tommy. Tommy. No, don't touch me! Don't touch me! Tommy, I'm sorry. Tommy, Tommy, please. Tommy. Tommy, look at me. Tommy. Please, Tommy. Tommy. Get away from me! Tommy. I'm sorry. I forgive you. No, no, no, no, no. You were driving. You did it. I didn't do anything. You're so fucking jealous and stupid. It's all on you. I don't think you fucking-- This is on you. This is on you. Dan. Dan. Dan. Dan? Dan. Dan. What happened to your father? Tommy, what-- what-- what happened to your father? Dan, say something. Put your hands on top of your head. Let's go. It was me. It was-- it was-- it was me. It was me. Tommy, I'm so sorry. You requested to see me? I have a favor to ask. You don't get any fucking favors. What if I confess to the rest of them? What do you want in return? Spare Tommy. You and I both know he's suffered enough. You're willing to let the person who attacked all those other people walk free? You know, Meredith, I have been waiting a long time for this. Me standing right where I am... and you standing right where you are. I have, too. But from where I'm standing... all I see is a mother without a daughter. You know, none of this would have happened if you hadn't fucked my husband and had that hideous child. You be careful in there. Uh, Lindsay decided not to come? I think it was too soon. Here. What's this? Oh, it's everything you'll need. Uh, house, accounts. Yeah. Just because dad was like this does not mean that you have to be, too. Kal, I'm cursed. Everyone I get close to... ends up hurt or-- or-- or worse. And I-- I love you. And I-- I just-- I-- I-- I just can't be around you... or anyone. Uh, I-- I think it's best if I just disappeared. Um... Look, don't come looking for me. I, uh... this is goodbye. Tommy. Wait! I said stop, you ass. Everything that I... that we've been through, it's just-- Listen, I know that there are things that we will never be able to understand. But you're my brother. And we're the only family that we have left. I-- I-- I just... I could never forgive myself. What are you gonna tell her then? I'd tell Olivia the same thing. But I don't think she'd get it. I'm sorry, Kal... but this is goodbye. One minute until lights out.
