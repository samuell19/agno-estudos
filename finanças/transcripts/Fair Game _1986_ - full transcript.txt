Kyla! Kyla! Thanks a lot, Frankie. It's all right, I've got you. Come on. Here we go. There. That wasn't so bad, was it? Tryin’ to get through, are ya? You won't catch me that way. Slower, slower! We'll make a sandwich! Get out of the way, you crazy moll! Hey, Sunny, you gotta hand it to Ringo. That's a great way to ask a bird out. So how did the windscreen crack? It was hit by a stone thrown up by their van. - Have you still got the stone? - No. Yeah, well, it's hardly what I'd call a hanging offense. - Probably just an accident. - It was no accident, Frank! Can't you understand? They nearly killed me! - Look, it may have seemed that way... - I'm formally requesting you to lay charges. Jess, I know you're upset, but there is no point frothing at the mouth like a mad dog... when there isn't even a bone to chew on! - I haven't finished yet! - I'm not going in front of the magistrate... till I've got some sort of proof! So far, you've offered me nothing! I also want you to charge them with trespassing on my property... shooting on a wildlife reserve, destruction of fences... - and cruelty to animals. - Yeah? So where is your evidence this time? Here. Oh, well, I'll get that to forensics right away... - Just do your job, Frank. - Look, Jess, why don't you go home... and have a cold shower? The heat's gettin' to you. Here's the bill, Jess. Thanks, Victor. All right, Sparksy, this one's for the family album! - Come on! - Hang on, let me go down! - What an honor, the family album. - Hey, Derek! Derek! - Come into this! Get Derek into this, huh? - Right on! That's the one! Look, who's here... - Thanks, Ma, for the camera! - Hi, darling! - Friend of yours? - She tried to run us off the road on the way in! - Did she? - Yeah! - What happened? - She lost! Is that the lot, then? Um... or perhaps you better serve the lady first. I'll just do one more circuit. - Hi, Jessie. - Hi. Your order's ready. It's just down there. - I'll get it. - Oh, thanks a lot. - How you feelin‘? - Oh, hot and bothered. I can imagine. I might have some flour too. - Is Ted still away? - Yep. Back on Wednesday. - Is this for us? - Only if you want it. Of course we want it! We love having your paintings in the shop. I just wish we could sell one for you once in a while. Well, perhaps when the tourist season gets into full swing. Yes, well we'll keep our fingers crossed. Maybe we should advertize? That painting, I'll buy it. - It's not one of my best. - Then you must be very good. I think this shows class. It's well-structured... - and the brushwork is excellent. - Oh, really? Hm, really. I like it a lot. - I wouldn't have picked you as an art lover. - Well, never judge a book by its cover. And never judge a painting with one glance. Excellent brushwork... It's pen and wash. Ha ha! Well, I still like it. - Well, that's um... 80 dollars, please. - Okay. Are you with them? No. They're with me. Then the price of the painting has gone up to 180 dollars. You and your boys can pay for the repairs to my car. Look... the boys were just having a bit of a game. No one meant you any harm. And I suppose you didn't mean any harm to the kangaroos either. We're just trying to earn a living. And we're doing the farmers a favor. Then what are you doing on a wildlife reserve? She's a very talented lady. That painting will be worth millions in years to come. Mmm... Kids, get back in bed now! Come on, you little rut! Come on, cut it out! Cut it out... Snap! Gotcha! - Oh! Cut it out! - Hey, look! Ah ha ha! Ha ha! You look good in make-up, Ringo! - Hey, what do you think you're doing?! - Sorry, just having a bit of a game. - Bitch! - Creep! - It's like ripping off a scab! - Oh, Sunny! Ha ha ha... Oi! Ethel, get away from there! You'll fall in! Kyla! Slug, move it! Come on, Slug, get out of the way. Hello? Hi, Ted. Listen, don't believe a word Kyla says. Yeah, it's hot. How about you? Hey, how's the conference? I'm jealous. No, you keep away from her, she's a loose woman. I should know. She is my lover. No, actually, it's not all right. We've had shooters on the property again. I found an injured joey this morning, and... Yeah. Yeah, I've seen Frank. He was his usual sympathetic self. What? Oh, while I was on my way to town this morning, I... Hello? Hello? Get away. Go away. Ethel... Kyla, get away from there. Kyla, be quiet. Mr. Taylor! It's Jessica. Hello? We're seeing a lot of you today. - What are you doing here? - Working. The Taylors invited us. - You weren't invited to my place. - Oh, you got off easy. The boys were upset. Besides, you're very photogenic. Just leave me alone! - Get off! - Kyla? - What's this? Get off! Get off! - It's impossible, that mongrel. - Get off! Save it for the sheep! - Kyla! - Get off! Get off! - Mongrel dog! - Kyla, in the car! - I should shoot that dog! It's crazy! He will be after biting you, Ringo. Now, that's what I call a masterpiece. I always said he had lead in his pencil. - Really amusing. - Hang on. Come back, come back, Come back, come back. Why don't you hang around for a while? I mean, the Taylors might be back soon. - Then again, maybe they won't. - Anyone else want a go? Perhaps the artist would like to add her own special touch. Yes, I would. You sure you can handle a high-caliber paintbrush? You could trigger off a whole new style. Only joking. Ha ha ha... My mother gave me that camera! Then take pictures of your mother. Nobody does that to Ringo Rudnik, you bitch! Just uh... use a bit of finesse. Aye, Ringo? You're a good dog, Kyla. Don't get so carried away next time, okay? Come on, girl. Cut across the backway. This way, Kyla. Kyla! Kyla! She's down there somewhere. Sorry. - I thought I saw something move. - You're an idiot. There's no market for lizards, Ringo. - It moved. - Yeah, too fast for you. Just shut up, both of you! I'm sick of this. I feel like a beer. Let's go back. Hey, Ringo, have a go at this! Come on, I wasn't ready! All right, I'll give it to you higher. Ready? All right, put it up, put it up! Here we go! Got it! Okay, wanna play a real clay pigeon? Now, look! Here's a big one! All right! Go on, try it again! Give us another one. Quick, quick, quick! A little clay pigeon. Here we are! Kyla? Ted? Who is it? Come on, you rabble-rouser! Get off my foot! Get it off! Sparks! - Woo! Presenting... our first real ride! - I'm gonna ride that filly! Woo! Oh, he's fallen off, ladies and gentlemen! Meet the back-end! Oh, you've done it now! Ha ha ha! Okay, horsey! It's branding-time at the Rudnik ranch! Let him go! Let him go now! Let him go! Home, Frankie! Look, this is my property. It's a wildlife sanctuary, and I'm authorized to order you off! - Sorry. - Thought I saw her lips move. Don't think you can scare me with your sick pranks either! - Pranks? - My utility? The dead kangaroo? What's the matter? Didn't he have a driver's license? Ha ha! If you don't leave immediately, I intend calling the police. What are you gonna use? Mental telepathy? - Haha! - Ha! Would you like to dance, spunky? "Jessie to Sergeant, Jessie to Sergeant, I'm in trouble. Do you read me?" I want you out of here by morning. - You cannot go yet! - Oh, no, not yet! The night's still young. And to be very honest, we could make beautiful music together. - Hey, Ringo! - Play us some music! Ha ha! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Sunny! - Well, get on the spotlight. - Hey, hey, hey, we're going hunting! Yeah! Ya-hoo! There she is! Which way now, Ringo? Where did she go? I don't know! I don't know! She runs like a rabbit! - Don't tell me you lost her! - We couldn't shoot her, could we? - It's a wildlife sanctuary... - Ha ha ha! Come on, let's get away, okay? - What's for dinner, Sunny? - Stew. Not your stew again... Come on, Frankie. Come on! Come on, let's go over here. Hey, Sparks, do you hear something? Ooh! Ringo. It's too early. Sunny! All right, all right! - What are we doing now? - Yeah. Still, it's not a bad welding job, aye? Maybe not, maybe not. Frankie! - Now we score. - There she is. Good! Go for it, Ringo. Get off! Sparks! I got her! I got her! Get off! What'll we do with her, Sunny? - Don't struggle, bitch! - Come on, Sparks. Ringo... pull that. - Come on... - Get up! - Stretch her. - With pleasure. Tie her. - It's the best hunting we've done in years! - Yeah! We'll just gonna even up the score a bit. What do you think her skin's worth, Sunny? Heaps. Well, I better do a good job then. Like a little nick here... and a little nick there.... Then I'll peel it all off just like a little bunny rabbit! Why don't you use the keys? Feel like another ride, huh? Ha ha ha! Get out of... Zorro! Strike three! You're out! Big bad wolf coming to get ya! Ah ha ha! Big bad wolf coming! Now, come on, that's not fair. You put that torch down! Burnie, burnie... Come on. Get off me! Get off! Sparks to Beast! Sparks to Beast! For roos I reckon you need a higher muzzle velocity. That's why I'd go for another Mauser 270 or a Remington... - 243. - Turn that up. - Sunny! - That's Sparks. Let go of me! Sparks! - Sparks! - Help me! Sparks, you all right? Yeah, but I think the gearbox has had it. - Does it hurt? - Heh... only when I laugh. Hang on, mate. We'll have you out of there in just a second. Good aiming. You bastards! Ah... a lot better to flush her out. Sunny! Sunny! Bring it in here! Smash in! Sorry, this number has been disconnected. Okay, let's go! Ringo! - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. Gimme the gun. - Why don't you just take it easy for a minute? - Who does she think she is? No more games, Sunny! That bitch! We should've made sure of it! I think he's right, Sunny. We should go after her now. - She can't have gotten very far. - Fix the Beast first. - Let's crack her down. - Do what I said. Now move it! You've got 10 minutes. I'll have it done in 5. Frankie! Let's go! Nah, she wouldn't be in there. Would she? Should've realized this was a dead end. Why don't you give up now, save us any more trouble? Can you hear her? Hey, Sunny... Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, go! Sunny! Sunny! Sunny! Frankie! Frankie! - What do we do now? - Shift it before it gets too dark. There she is! - Forget her. - Yeah, let's get out of here. I can't breathe. That should slow her up a bit. It's jammed! - Come on! - Calm down! What's she doing? No! No! What's she doing?! - Walking away. - Which direction? Back. The way she came. Nope. Not this way. We'll go in around there. Watch out! Sort this mess out. Sparks, get us out of here! Come on, let's go! Look out! Let's go! - Let go! - I'm all right, Sunny! Ringo? Ringo? We'll get her. We'll get her. That's it! No more Mr. Nice Guy!
