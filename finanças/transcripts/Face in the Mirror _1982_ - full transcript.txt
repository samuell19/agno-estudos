- Well just try to get him to join in. Please. - How? He's boring. He's dull. The sled. Ah, Danny. (police sirens) (sinister music) (ambulance sirens) - Let me drive you to the hospital Anthony. - Would you like to give me some information now, Mr Lowe? - I'm going to the hospital too, Officer. - And I'm going with him. - I'll join you there after I take some phone numbers here. Everyone don't leave yet! We need to get your names and phone numbers. So if you just step inside the church for a moment. This won't take long. (sirens blaring and equipment beeping) (muffled murmurs) - Could I have your attention? I realize everyone is tired and beyond talking tonight. We would like to get your names and telephone numbers. And we will contact you later. - Well I think these young people should just forget the whole thing. They're upset enough as it is. - Why should our children be harassed because of the lunatic behaviour of one disturbed boy? - Right! It's best they just put it out of their minds. - Danny DeMarco may die sir! We can't just put a boy's life out of our minds. - Sir, that is a police matter now. - Let's get on with it and get out of here. - Maybe I should go and be with Mary? - Myann and Jerry went. And the pastor will be there. - Yes. I suppose you're right. (sirens blaring) (urgent music) - Is the patient stable? - [Man] I got vitals. BP 70 over 40. Pulse 120. Respiration's 40 shallow. - Patient's critical. Let's get in the emergency room. - [Pastor Billings] Father we pray for the life of a boy that is suffering. We pray that he may have another chance to know you. We ask this in Jesus' name. - Who cares about first place in chess? I mean, what normal boy cares about chess? Why can't you win at something important? I played sports all my life and I end up with a chess player. It's all your fault. You've made a weakling out of him. - I think it's wonderful he won first place. - Do you? I'm surprised he hasn't taken up cooking or embroidery. I bet he'd be great at lace-making. - [Mary] Anthony, don't! - I never wanted an oddball for a son, Mary! All the other fathers brag about their sons and I can't say one word. My friends all feel sorry for me. Having a loser for a son. A loser for a son. - [Doctor] Let's get some suction on this patient. Get some O2 by mask. (beeping) - I can't understand how we missed all the signs, Jerry? I can't understand why. There was one day. I really appreciate your help, Danny. You know, goodness is in the little things. Like helping someone carrying groceries. "I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me". That's Psalm 131, verse one. I stick to the little things. - My mother's like that. But my favorite psalm is Psalm 69, verse 20. "Scorn has broken my heart and left me helpless, I looked for sympathy but there was none. For comforters but I found none". - Oh Danny, you're dramatizing. You're too young to feel like that. - Am I? - Dear Lord He told me but I didn't hear. Forgive me. - Type and cross match five units back red blood cells. Prep for surgery. Stat! - I'm going over to the hospital. - I'm going off duty but Eddie should be there by now. Sure a lot more calls like this than there used to be. - Suicide rate among 15 to 24 year olds has increased by 300% in the last 20 years Dave. - That much? - That much. - [Teacher] Suicides are the third leading killer of teenagers in our country today. Many experts believe that it's the first leading killer because many teenage deaths are covered up by doctors who are sympathetic to parents. Every year in this country, 5,000 kids succeed in killing themselves. The number who attempt and fail, 500,000. Now psychiatrists believe that today in our society, 1 in every 5 kids suffers the symptoms of some sort of depression. A depression that could lead to death in the teen years. Can you keep a family together? Can you bring back a belief in one creator? Can you stop the 1,000,000 cases of battered children that we get in our country every year? And can you give these kids back the self-esteem that's been taken away from them through the years? What can you do? - With God's help, I can try. - Oh Danny! Why? I wasn't anything in school either, honey. Not everyone can be important. Just take what you can get. - Dad. - Well, he was a big athlete you know. And he's just disappointed that's all. I mean, well. Here, I made your favorite cookies. - Mum. - There's no sense talking about it. Just forget it. You'll forget about it tomorrow. Tomorrow! (tense music) - Mary! - I don't know! - They're taking Danny to surgery, Mrs DeMarco. If you'll follow me, I'll show you to the waiting room. - They're moving him now, Officer Brandon. If you'll just wait a moment I'll get you the information. - So, when you feel like putting down people that don't know the Lord yet. Keep Paul's word to the Ephesians. Chapter two, verse 12 in mine. "Remember that at one time, you were separate from Christ. Without hope and without God in the world". What other scripture fits in with witnessing to others? - "I was a stranger and you invited me in" - [Jerry] Matthew 25:35, good Mark! - "And he has given us this command, whoever loves God must also love his brother". First John 4:21. - How does that work? They're not our brothers until they accept Jesus as their savior. Are they? - Yeah, it's bad enough to have to like some of my Christian brothers who are creeps. - [Jerry] Turn to First John, chapter 4, verses 19 and 20. "We love because he first loves us. If anyone says I love God, and yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen". - Okay, we've gotta love everybody. I'll praise the Lord and love all my brothers if somebody'll pass the marshmallows. (laughter) - I left them in the car. (groans) - Wendy! - Come one, we need more firewood anyway. - Well I guess that leaves us to pick up the paper. - C'mon Wendy, let's do trash duty. - I always end up with the rotten jobs. - I'll help too. - Is something bothering you Danny? - Why? - You seem a little down. - A little. - Share, Danny. That's what brothers are for. - "I am a stranger to my brothers". Psalm 69. Eight. - [Darren] Here comes the marshmallows crew! (cheering) - Hey let's pass them over there. - Okay (chattering) - Oh Danny! Did I just pass on by you? I meant to get back but I got too busy. - [Nurse] Surgical waiting room now. Third floor. - Georgia, stop that sniffling. It's getting on my nerves. This whole thing had nothing to do with us. - [Georgia] But I was so frightened. Darren might have been hurt. - Well he wasn't! You'd think the church would be more careful about letting a nutcase like that in a youth group. I tell you, I'm going to that board meeting next week and give it a piece of my mind. - Come on Mum! I had to invite that creep but I am not gonna spend the evening with him. - Honey, poor Danny isn't having any fun. - Mother, poor Danny is a drag. He can't have fun. He's too happy being miserable. - Well just try to get him to join in. Please. - How? He's boring. He's dull. He's a sled. Danny! Danny. - Don't think about it son. The kid was sick. You had nothing to do with it. Absolutely nothing. - Mary, Anthony. Let us pray together. - I don't feel like it, Pastor. You and Mary go right ahead. - Mary. - I can't! - Such a tragedy. - Yes it is. - Have you heard anything from surgery? - Not a word. - You just go on up to bed, honey. I'll bring you some nice, warm milk. - It was all so scary! - Don't dwell on it Kim. Just try to forget the whole thing. It had nothing to do with you. You can't be responsible for someone's mental illness. - Well you are wrong Danny! The Bible says "Thou shalt not kill". That includes all people. Thick or not. You're just arguing to get attention. - Yeah he's always trying to get attention that way. - You can't always win an argument by attacking the other person Kim. Try thinking sometimes instead of yelling. - I hate you Danny DeMarco! I really hate you! - "Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer. And you know no murderer has eternal life in him", First John 3:15. - Drop dead Danny DeMarco! I'll bet you aren't even really a Christian so you can just drop dead. - Forget it, Kim dear. It has nothing to do with you. - I was pretty sure that Danny wasn't, well that he never really accepted the Lord as his personal savior. We were talking. Just after witnessing class. About the first step toward accepting the Lord. Confessing your sins. But Danny, remember Romans 3:23? "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God". We have to understand that so we realize what the Lord has done for us. - Or to us. - What? - Oh Carrie! Don't you ever find that sometimes it's too hard? - Being a Christian? - Just being. - I know I have eternal life Danny. If I didn't have that it would be impossible. Like in Romans, 6:23. "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord". - So? - So no matter how tough things might get, I've got the Lord and eternity on my side. - Carrie. - [Girl] Hey Carrie, come one. You're supposed to help clean up. - What Danny? - [Girl] Carrie! - Nothing, nothing. - I should've forgotten to clean up and stayed with Danny. Mum, I never brought up the subject again. Now, it may be too late. - Let's ask the Lord's help about this, Carrie. We'll pray for Danny. And for our understanding of the Lord's will. - How can you take their side when you know how sensitive T.S is about everything? - He is old enough to know. - He is too young to have to deal with things like this. - Are you always gonna protect him? He'll adjust. - If I have to, I'll protect him. You act like you care more for those people at church. - So how do you feel? - Mother thinks I'm too young to do anything. Father doesn't think of me at all. But you've got to play the game, if you wanna be somebody. - Be somebody. - You know what I mean. Sure I don't like a lot of things Darren says and does. But if I go against him, poof! There go all the parties. I end up being alone in the lunch room. Dead! - Like me. - You can't be alone Danny. You gotta be in a group. - Like Darren's? - Somebody's. - What about our Christian brotherhood at church? - Church isn't where it's at. - Yeah. - I mean, I believe and all that. Doesn't work in the real world, does it? - Guess not. - Father, I faked it all these years. I wanted others to like me. I made others more important than you. Forgive me. Please. Forgive me for not giving my life to you. I know Christ died for me. Jesus come into my heart. Now. And forever. - Help us to understand your will. Amen. - Mr and Mrs DeMarco, we're moving Danny to intensive care from the recovery room. I'll be taking you downstairs and then you can see him just briefly. - Is he alright? - The doctor'll speak to you there. - Mr and Mrs Lowe, I'd like to get those statements now. Pastor Billings, if you wouldn't mind coming also. They've let us borrow an office downstairs. - I don't know how things like this happen. They're not supposed to happen in a church. They're just not supposed to happen. - But it did Daddy! I was terrified. I could have been killed. - Things like this are not supposed to happen. - Susan think of how poor Mary and Anthony must feel. - They should never have allowed him to act like this. - That's right! It's all their fault. It's all their fault. - Dawn? What's the matter? You look a little down. - I'm just waiting for Kim. She's at a cheerleader meeting. - Come on, I'll walk you home. - No, I promised I'd wait. - Want company? - No thanks Danny, I uh. - You don't wanna be seen with me. Especially by Kim Stanton and her friends. - That's not it, I, oh Danny. Just bug off please. I don't wanna be mean. - You're always doing things you don't wanna do. - What are you talking about? - You hate waiting for Kim but you do it. You're always talking about brotherhood in Sunday School but you don't practice it. You don't wanna be mean but you are. Especially if Kim's around. - Mind your own business Danny! - I just thought we were supposed to care about our Christian brothers and sisters. I was just pointing out - Oh just point yourself in another direction and go away. You're right! I don't wanna be seen with a creep like you. I have to be nice to you in church and that's all. Danny, go away you're embarrassing me. - Dawn, I'm sorry you waited. We have to go over to Betty's and finish our meeting. I'll pick you up tomorrow. It's not my fault. It's not my fault! - Well it's certainly someone's fault. And you'd better look into it. We can't have Wendy involved in this kind of thing again. - Mmhmm - All I can say is, no matter how it works out, I do hope they have sense enough to leave the church. I mean after all, it would make everyone nervous just having them around. (laughter and chattering) - Oh no, Danny you dummy! Look what you've done! You've ruined my dress. - Do you have to get attention at someone else's expense, Wendy? - You're always clumsy Danny DeMarco. - Not that clumsy, Wendy Jacobs. (whispers) - Thanks - Here Wendy, let's try to get that out. - That was a truly Christian act. - Drop dead! - What's the matter honey? Not enough mayonnaise? See what it's done to her? I hope those people pay for upsetting our girl. I really hope they pay. - Danny. - I don't think he can hear you, Mr DeMarco. You realize, he may not. - You asleep? - No. Stay. I'm confused. - Was Danny? I mean, is he a good friend? - I tried to be friends with Danny and tonight, he was like a stranger tonight. Someone. - I thought you were going to go to sleep and talk about it in the morning. - I was. But I can't sleep. I think I need to talk about it. I don't know where to start. Things were going wrong for Danny long before tonight. - We've got all night. Start where you want to. - It was always so hard to talk to Danny because he had a giant inferiority complex. He kinda was bothered being a super athlete or something. You gotta move it Danny, my bus was late! - Kim and Darren will have made the decisions anyway. - Hey we have just a big a voice on the committee as they do. Forget your complexes for a while and just worry about doing the Lord's work. We'll be witnessing to a lot of little kids at the children's festival. And why, that's what's important. - Mark, I don't wanna be in the committee. - Danny, Darren and his personality shouldn't have anything to do with what you do for the Lord. Don't let him get to ya. - It's not that. I don't wanna witness to those little kids. I can't - But as a Christian, we're supposed to. - I said I don't want to Mark! Darren's got nothing to do with it. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to push. Well look, we'll skip the meeting if you want to and talk. - I gotta go. - Well I'll go with you. - No, you go to the meeting. I can't. - Danny! - I can't! I'm not a good liar. - Danny! Danny! Danny. I just stood there like a dumb bird calling his name when i should've run after him. He wasn't a Christian. That's why he couldn't witness. He couldn't talk to those little kids because he didn't believe himself. He needed someone to witness to him. And I let him go and went to a meeting instead. - Did you talk to him later? - I tried a few times. Before the meeting last night, but not too hard. Because I was busy with homework and the festival and all that. He didn't show up to the festival so I was surprised to see him at the meeting for the committee. - We have had some encouraging reports from some of the parents whose kids came to the festival. - [Mark] I didn't get to say hello even. Because Jerry was talking. - If you obeyed the Lord, and brought the little children to him. - [Mark] Danny deliberately put a chair between us. - Any problems? - [Kim] Kids can really ask some hard questions. - [Mark] I tried to smile or something to make him welcome but he just watched Jerry with a funny look on his face. - For the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say. Didn't he come through for you? - Sure, but well what about First Peter 3:15? - Who can answer that? - Well, we're supposed to study the scripture all the time anyway. When we get a question, I guess, the Holy Spirit leads us to give the right answers. - If we listen to him, and don't panic. - Huh? - Well, I mean sometimes we feel that we have to give a perfect answer because it all falls on us. - I still don't get it? - When we're doing our best for the Lord it's in his hands, isn't it? We aren't supposed to get our own egos into it. - Ah, Mark's making excuses. He took so long with some of his kids, I'm surprised he had any takers at all. - [Kim] A little jealousy there Mark? - I think the Lord is more interested in quality rather than quantity. You and Darren were rushing those kids through like they were on an assembly line. One, two, three and you're a Christian. - We couldn't help it because our lines were longer than yours Wendy. After all, the kids chose who they wanted to go to. - Yeah they did, I did something wrong cause I practically had to kidnap a couple of kids. I think they were going for the pretty faces. - Well thanks a lot. - Let's get back to the word. I realize that we still have some problems to iron out. The more you witness and study the Bible, the better you'll serve the Lord in this way. - Maybe that's my problem? I should study the word more. Wait til I'm more ready to witness. If I ever am. - James 1:22, T.S. The Lord tells us to apply what we read in the word. "Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves. Do what is says. Anyone who listens to the word, and does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in the mirror and after looking at himself, he goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like". You don't want to be like the man who forgets his own face in a mirror. We read the scripture and apply it to our learning. The Lord tells us to give an answer to everyone who asks us. We must (gasping) - [Mark] For some reason, I wasn't surprised. I was shocked, I guess. But I wasn't really surprised. That was the worst feeling of all. - Danny! - Isn't there a scripture for this, Jerry? Don't tell me you're at a loss for words. - Very funny Danny. You've got our attention so what do you want? He's just making a play for our attention. That's obvious. (gunshot) - Don't! - [Mark] We didn't know that Mr Doyle had been cleaning the hall and had checked. - It works you see. I just wanted to demonstrate the point for Darren. - [Mark] We were all thinking that no one would notice a problem until we were late coming home. - If it says in Peter that you should give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. How come no one answered my question? - Why don't you ask those questions now, Danny? You certainly have our attention. - Yes but now it's too late, isn't it. - It's never too late for the Lord, Danny. The Lord gives everyone a chance. He wishes no one to perish. - Really? Well it seems to me everyone here was too busy to bother with anyone else. Like the way Darren tallied up the number of kids he witnessed to like he was competing for first prize. Didn't know God played favorites until Darren convinced me. - I haven't done anything to you - You didn't do anything for me either - Well what do you want for crying out loud! I don't get it. - [Mark] Danny had the saddest look I've ever seen one someone's face. Kind of lost. Hopeless. - I don't want anything from you. Or anyone else. - Danny the Lord doesn't play favorites. - Yes he does Mark. Some people are always the head of the table. Some people, always outside begging. Some people convince themselves they're better than others when they're not. Some people think they're somebody if they hang around others who are and become their servants. Some are important because others have told them so and they believe it to be true. Some are important because they are everybody's idea of what you should be. They please the majority, even if the majority is mediocre. And there's some people who are somebody by letting other people tell them how to live and think and act. Some people are somebody because they deserve it. The real somebodies deserve it. And work at it. Those are the only real somebodies. - You're somebody too Danny! - I'm a nobody Mark. I was born and educated to be nothing. And I do that real well. - He's nuttier than a fruitcake. He's not making any sense at all. - I can't hear you Darren. - Um, I was just saying that I couldn't understand what you were saying. - I'm saying I don't want to live in a world where people like Darren Barrows are someone just because they're charming without any kindness for anyone. - Don't shoot! - They're good looking without ever looking to do good for anyone else. They please adults cause they say all the right things to them. But never talk to those beneath them. Empty hypocritical shells of ego. It's a poem Darren. I wrote it about someone like you. Pretty empty shell of hypocritical ego. Wherever they go, then must we go. - It would figure that you wrote poetry. - Shut up Darren! - Danny, I think it's obvious that we've all failed you and that you feel badly about it. Won't you give us another chance? - Please Danny, don't hurt yourself anymore. - You missed the point Myann. I'm doing this so I won't hurt anymore. (sirens blaring) We have company. I didn't plan on this large an audience. (suspenseful music) (gunshot) - [Mark] I just couldn't move fast enough. It was like, like I was underwater. Or in a slow-motion movie. I just couldn't move fast enough. - [Mr Keats] You did your best son. - Too late. Danny had been asking for help for a long time. And I didn't hear him. I was just too late. - The best thing you can do for your friend right now Mark, is pray. Father, we come to you together to ask in the name of your son, for the life of a friend. Let Mark help him understand how much you love your children and how unimportant the world is compared to your love. Give him is life here on Earth. That he may find his savior. And have eternal life in you. - Please, dear Lord, don't let him die not believing in you. - [Danny] I'm nobody Mark. I was born and educated to be nothing. And I do that real well. Don't you ever find some times too hard? - Being a Christian? - [Danny] Just being. - Danny. He needs you too. I know, cause we're alike in a lot of ways. Please let him live. Please Lord. - Oh Danny. Why did you depend on people so much? They don't mean to fail one another, but they almost always do. The Lord never fails you. Most kids like you are where they are because they wanted the lesser love of others and ignored the greater love of God. - Anything? - No change. - Thought you might need this. - Thanks - I'll stay with Anthony if you need to go home. - I could cancel some meetings but. - This may go on for some time. - You're right. - I'll call if there's any change. - Okay. - Morning Mr Keats, is Mark up yet? - Come in T.S, he'll be glad to see you. - I uh, I had. - I know son. Come on in. - But what if? - No, you just rest Mary. Now you getting sick can't help. Just rest. (telephone rings) - Hello Myann is he? Well he got through the night. I'll get dressed and come right down. No, I'm happy to help Myann. It'll take me about a half an hour or so, is there anything I can bring? - T.S? - I needed to talk to you. - [Mrs Keats] I'll stop at Mary's and pick up some things for her. Goodbye dear. - [Mr Keats] You go on honey, we'll be just fine. My specialty is cereal and toast, fellas. - I can scramble some eggs Mr Keats - Ah, to the stove young fella. Mark, you take care of the toaster. And you slugger bed, you unfreeze the juice. - Do you people know what time it is? - Forward troops, man your stations. I'll attack the hot chocolates. Instant, that is. - I'm sorry there's no change. - I realize that I had the same problem as Danny. I thought I had to do whatever Darren said or I'd have no friends. Darren and Kim could've caused me a lot of trouble at school if I went against them. Like Danny. - I don't even have that excuse. (telephone rings) - Hello. Keats residence. Oh hi, Carrie. No, we haven't heard anything. T.S is over here. Why don't you come over too? Okay, goodbye. - Thou shalt not kill. If he dies, he'll be judged a murderer. - No news yet Mary. Try to get some more rest. - Oh I dreamed. About Danny. - A lot of us are praying for Danny. That's the best thing you can do for him right now. - Yeah. Pray. - I don't know how to pray. Everyone just seems to dive in, you know. - But you always prayed in Sunday School? - I just copied Darren or somebody. Pray for real. - Well just talk to the Lord as if he's sitting here at the table with us. He is. Father, he came to us. And we all passed him by. Like the beggar in the Bible. I was too busy. Please. Give me another chance to help my friend. - Lord, I tried to keep away from you, cause. Was it because you reminded me of myself? Show me a way to help Danny And help myself. - Help me to fit into your plan. For all of us and Danny. - We ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. - We need a plan. - [Mark] Well why don't we go and tell Pastor Billings that Danny never became a Christian. Well he's be the most able to get to Danny and his mum and dad. (knocking) (knocking) - Hey, wait a minute. Myann Lowe called mum from the hospital today. She and Jerry must be there. - Jerry'd be able to get to Danny. - Forward troops, as your dad would say. - Mary's sleeping and they don't think there'll be a change in Danny's condition Tony. Let me take you home for a shower and some breakfast. You're only five minutes away. - I would like a shower. - [Nurse] May I help you? - We were looking for the people with Danny DeMarco. - [T.S] Is he okay? - He's still the same. No one from the family is here right now. And you shouldn't be up here either. - Thanks anyway. - What are you doing? That's only the next floor. - You've got an idea. - Uh huh. Carrie aren't you one of those girls in the pink and white things? The ones that do the - Candy-Stripers? - Yeah. - I know what you're thinking about but it won't work. They don't let you bring plants or anything into intensive care. You have to leave them at the desk. Until they move the patient to another room. - Besides we can't be candy-stripers. - Yeah, but Carrie is one. Where's your uniform? - Here. In the locker room. - Go get it on. Go on. We'll wait here. - What are we gonna be? The plants? - This is for a Mr Charles. - Well I'm sorry, but we don't have a Mr Charles. Let me check. Someone might have moved in yesterday. No, no one within the past two days named Charles. Let me call surgery and emergency for arrivals. Hello Molly? Do you have a Mr Charles? What's his first name, hun? - Um, Lloyd. - A Lloyd Charles. No. Okay thank you. Yes, this is intensive care. Do you have a Mr Lloyd Charles coming up from emergency? Thank you. Sorry, you'll have to go downstairs for that information. Hate to see you carry that monster all the way down again. - Oh well, that's what I'm here for. - Guess you caught me huh? - Out! - Danny? Danny? I don't know if you can hear me. But I want you to hear what the Lord says. Romans 3:20. Romans 3:23. "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God". See Danny? We're all sinners. That's why we all failed you. And that's why you why you did what you did. Romans 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death, the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord". Danny. Danny, even if. Oh! Help me. Help me Lord. I can't do this by myself. The Lord wants to love you forever Danny. John 3:16. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only son. That whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life". He died for you Danny. Jesus died for you. - Uh oh! - What? - They'll catch Mark. - We better explain things to Jerry. - Jerry there's something you should know before you go upstairs. - [Jerry] What is it? - We tried to sneak into the ICU. Mark's up there with Danny right now. - John 14:6. "Jesus said I am the way, and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me". Don't you see Danny? Jesus said it himself. Jesus is the only way to heaven. - I think you were right about Danny, kids. I do appreciate the fact that you tried to help. - We'd better go get Mark out of that room before he gets into trouble. - Danny. Can you hear me? John 1:12. "Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of God". Ask him to come into your heart and he will save you for eternity. Just ask. He can hear you. Just say in your mind. I believe in you Jesus. Come into my heart. (beeping) - Room 413. - What are you doing in here? Out! - Tony, what is it? What's happened? - Danny, we're here son! I, I, - I believe in you Jesus! Come into my heart. - Everything's gonna be alright. - If you'll all stay in the waiting room please. - Mark! - Danny was awake when I left him and behaving in a very Christian way! - Did you say Christian? - I sure did! (cheering) - Thank you Lord! - Thank you, thank you Lord! - I'll see you in Sunday School. And don't forget, the Lord really loves you. - I don't know - Come here. This is Evie. Evie this is Mark. - Hi Evie! (busy chattering) - So you see, we're all born sinners and we all do the wrong thing sometimes, don't we? - Like hitting my little sister! - Like that yes! But we know God is good and can't live with sin, right? - Right! So we've got to be sorry and ask him to forgive us. - Right! Why? - So that his son, Jesus, will come into my heart. - What else? - I know I'm a sinner. I know God doesn't like sin. But he loves me. So his son died for me. And I say I'm sorry for being bad. I want him to come into my heart. Jesus I mean. I'll live forever with him, in heaven and everything. Right? - Right! - Right! - Now we've read about it Charlie but the Bible tells us to do what it says. Now what should you do next? - I should do it! Ask Jesus into my heart! Will you help me? - Yes Charlie, I'll help. - [Mark] The Lord wants to love you forever Danny! Just ask! Ask him to come into your heart and he'll save you for eternity. Hi Charlie! - [Charlie] Hi. - Can you tell me what went on here between you and Danny? - Well we were talking about sinning and forgiving and accepting Jesus as my savior. - [Jerry] Do not merely listen to the word. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror. And after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
