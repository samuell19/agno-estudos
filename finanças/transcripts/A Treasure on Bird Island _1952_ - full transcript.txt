When I look at the sky as the birds are flying away, I do not want to leave you, my nest in my native land. But I have to go with them. It is autumn and the time is here. In here it will be very cold. Here will be snow and frost. We are flying to hot countries where the hot sun always shines. Come spring we will return, just as everyone wishes us to. The people here are nice and they do not destroy our nests. We sing for them each day: Chirp, chirp, chirp. We fly over the vast sea to a fairytale island. Over there we live with people as well. They work and hunt and they, too, are nice to us. They do not destroy our nests. We sing for them each day: Chirp, chirp, chirp. The trip over the sea to the fairytale land is long. we have been up here for days, our wings going numb. Finally! We are here! Hello, our little island! You are still as small in the middle of white sea foam. And the people here are always happy. Hello dear people. We have been flying to you for so long. How we were looking forward to this! We have good friends here. They do not destroy our nests. We will sing sweetly for them. Chirp, chirp, chirp. Whoever may this boy be? Do we know him? Who is he? It is little Al??ek, a fisherman. How he has grown this summer! We like him more and more. He does not destroy our nests. He understands bird songs. Chirp, chirp, chirp. Hello dear Al??ek. Now we are all back here. Talk to us for a while, perhaps without a fairytale. What has been happening here? You have missed us, right? Do not frown. Is your net full each time? Swallows, my darlings. There are none better than you in the whole world. You soar from the sky to the white foam and sing to us from early morning. Now I will tell you, as is surely your wish, what happened when you left. When you left in the spring, it was sad here on the island without you. You were somewhere overseas,and we lived here without a single song. Everyone here missed you, but none more than me, dear swallows. Instead of your songs the town was filled with noises made by people. From the forge came sounds of hits. Whoever wished to work had a lot to do: the shoemaker made shoes as people needed them, the potter made beautiful vases out of clay. The carpenter dilligently worked on wood, having started working as soon as he woke up in the morning. The weaver weaved strong sheets, the baker baked bread and such. Each of them was good at something. They helped each other out. Everyone liked the island. The soil was fertile and generous. The soil was quite generous indeed. And the sea was giving as well. From the early morning fishermen were meeting up on the sea. And in the evenings they had full nets. For the fish they got shoes from the shoemaker, strong ropes from the ropemaker, sails from the sailmaker and bread from the baker. They worked without toil. Everyone had what they needed. When you were overseas we lived here without songs. Everyone missed you, but none more than me, dear swallows. I only had the pelican left, a giant among birds, but also among troublemakers. All in all an unusual bird. No use even talking about him. Life flowed just like the golden clouds above water. We all liked each other and we lived in peace. But once, while fishing, the waves carried me further than ever before. Now I shall tell you what fate had in store for me. Not only for me, however, but for everyone that are on the island with me. And in that dark moment I came face to face with fate. And from the moment I saw that beautiful ship I became ashamed of my boat and angry at life. Should I, Al??ek, a fisherman, fight the sea for those few fish until I die? It is better to just eat and sleep, and listen to beautiful music. I knew just how to do it. By finding a treasure. But where? On the bottom of the sea! There of course. I could find pearls there. I will start looking right away! And so I became a pearl hunter. Underwater, there is a beautiful world. One cannot even look at it all. But such a pity! There is only water in there. And you almost drown before even seeing the beauty. I was returning home in the evening with an empty net and hunger on top of it. And hunger on top of it. I have neither pearls nor fish. What will I eat for breakfast tomorrow? Without fish I will not get bread. I should have just fished, yes. But I will wake up in the morning and we will see how things go. A few apples can last me a whole day. Foolish is whoever frowns at the world. But I am not like that. And today I am sure I will find a beautiful pearl. It is terrible to be caught in a net like a fish. How to explain this? They will make fun of me. And once again I return with an empty net and plagued by hunger. But I do not like to give up. What is in it for me to fish and then give my fish for bread and shoes and stay poor? If only I found a pearl. I would live like a prince: eat well, sleep well, in short I would do nothing. But what to eat tomorrow? It is hard to fool hunger. A watermelon is enough for a day. I will return all that I have taken just as soon as I am king. The most powerful. The wealthiest. Right after I find the pearl. Today I will. I am sure. Something big will happen. I will get unbelievably lucky. Even now I am shaking in fear. Who would want to remember that? I will rather fish again. Better to be a fisherman than a king. I returned to my work again. The time flowed nicely. With the fishermen I fished and sang. But sometimes I had a desire to be as wealthy as a king. The picture of that beautiful ship could not be chased out of my mind even by a shark. That is quite something. It is no one other than Ibrahim the Pirate himself. There is so much I know about him. He invades and loots ships and hurts people however he can. He steals goods, kidnaps kids and sells them to Turkey. And I now have here before me the terrible Ibrahim. But how does a terryfying pirate get by without a ship? He probably lost his ship in the storm and only managed to save himself. I will make sure he lives so he can one day go back to a respectable life. I will not just leave him here. Hopefully he turns to a decent job. We will see how it goes. It would seem that this terrible pirate thought he was dying. To reward me for being nice to him he told me that once upon a time he hid gold on the island. He gave me a map that would surely lead me to the treasure right there, at that mark. Not a bit closer or a bit further. And I ran with the map home to my two friends, excited. After all, I cannot carry a treasure by myself. We are all loyal friends, neither one will tell anything. Neither one of the three of us is a snitch. We will not say a single word. Not a word to anyone. To stop the shouting and arguing, the oldest one of us gives out advice. Be smart and stop fighting. No one is taking it away from you. Let us divide it. Trust me, everyone will get enough gold to live like a prince until they die. We listened to this smart advice and got together. Together we loaded up the treasure and together we drove it back home. We were nice to each other and praised the cleverness of the old man. Now we will just eat and sleep, be happy and have fun. And so the treasure was soon taken to an old abandoned fort. The treasure will stay there for now and the three most honest men will divide everything fairly like between friends. And the others can only look. However, they would prefer to be dividing the treasure like those three instead. Fafar, the clever old man who gives advice to everyone. Abu, who never makes mistakes while counting can add up even thousands. Abubitrz, so fair it made people wonder. Those three are dividing the gold. And those in front of the gate are watching those three. It is a nice spectacle. And the others in the street are all laughs and cheers. Not a single cloud of anger. Just a lot of sun and singing. Each one of them is rich. A horseshoe. But why is it here? The blacksmith silently thinks about it. There is no need for a man as rich as me to make horseshoes and nails. Now it is all different. But it is useless to be angry. Out with all this old junk! The shoemaker, just like the blacksmith, threw out all sorts of things. Now he can live without working, after all he is now rich. The potter also had a lot of things which he broke and threw out as well. They all had the same idea. They are rich so why should they toil? Why work? The baker also let it all go. Why should he rush and work at night? He will just sleep. It was a beautiful morning and everyone on the island was asleep. This was no small change. Just yesterday there were busy craftsmen, fishermen and farmers here. But from yesterday evening there are only rich men here. They sleep as they wish. And so the women also woke up later than usual and went shopping for food. And suddenly there is not a single piece of bread anywhere. There is not a single apple, nor a single fish. There is nothing to buy. The fishermen also like to sleep and dream sweet dreams rather than fish the whole day and fight the sea. They are rich, have a lot of gold and so they do nothing at all. They dream of a wonderful life. They sleep as deeply as the baker does. Not a piece of bread anywhere and the blacksmith is already hungry. And to forget about it he goes to watch the treasure. Dividing the treasure is not easy. The work, the thinking, what to put on which pile. Of those outside everyone wants the best for themselves. There is a lot of shouting and chaos. My eyes widen in surprise. At the sight of all that gold, former good friends behave worse than caged tigers. What has gotten into those people? Now the best thing to do is leave quickly before getting hurt. The town is also different. Everyone is asleep and dreaming about that fortune. And so Hassan, the ropemaker, let work be and is sleeping lazily. And Ale, a gardener, is dreaming of building palaces, gardens, and beautiful parks, all of it without working of course. So what if they are plagued by hunger? Today everyone is hungry. Nobody on the island wants to work today. The baker sleeps in peace, dreaming of wealth too. He will just sleep and sleep. And Omar, a tailor, is thinking and daydreaming just like this when he suddenly sees something. A bone from the garbage. That is all the food that is left in here. The tailor is hungry. This bite to eat would surely appease his stomach. It would be a waste of bone to leave it to the dogs. That was quite a sight to see. Omar, a man like few others, was a completely different man today. He fights the dogs as if he were one too. What a terrible sight! How come that there used to be enough of everything and today there is barely one bone. It is all like it was before. The sea, the sun, the houses, the trees, but the people have changed. They do not work, they are jealous ever since the treasure was uncovered. Is it possible for gold to have such dark power? What a chaos! Great neighbors fight tooth and nail for a small fish. How come no one can take their boat out to the sea anymore? In the sea there are thousands of fish! The treasure creates problems. We were better off without it. So... I am the one to blame for it. I was the one to find the pirate. Now I know what to do to have peace here once again. I will just go to the pirate and have him leave with all that gold! So I rushed home. The pirate was still living with me. He was also plagued by hunger in my house where the terrible pirate Ibrahim hid. I had a heart to heart with him. I told him how bad it has gotten. Asked to have him take the treasure away. Begged him for those people who now hate one another beacause of his gold. I did not have to beg for long. He was, perhaps, already planning to take the treasure himself. He was a man of action! It was exactly noon while we were sailing to the old fort, an appropriate time for our task. The sun was so hot that everyone fell asleep as soon as they sat down. And so they were all sleeping in front of the gate. Hopefully everyone inside the fort will be asleep as well. Such loud noises. Why is that pirate acting as if he were here alone? As if he were here alone? Those in front of the gate will wake up! I will just quickly look over there. It would be better if I ran away before they found out. They would say that I am in cahoots with Ibrahim and I do not like that. It came out. Oh no! Those in front of the gate have noticed that something is happening inside. The pirate is probably done. But what now? What now? That is a problem. What kind of spectacle to use to distract those in front of the gate? Oh yes! Now I know what to do! The fishermen almost died when they saw how the boat sank and the entire treasure disappeared in the sea and in the waves. Now it is lost forever. Forever. Those desperate fishermen will never see it again. Only the pirate managed to save himself. Only Ibrahim the pirate. There is no point in going after him. The treasure is gone and so the fishermen turned the boat around, very unhappy and dejected. They sailed back to the island and the waves carried the pirate somewhere far away once more. There, as we all know, a new adventure is awaiting him. Those on shore are eagerly waving to the boat. One of the fishermen stood up and called out in a sad voice: Our gold has drowned. We are poor once again. What a pity. Everyone was desperate. Oh how much they fought. Oh how much they starved. Just to have nothing now. They had no other choice but to go back to what they once found worthwhile. And so they returned home. Just like the blacksmith, who now stands sadly in his forge and thinking that this is the end of dream castles, that this is the end of dreams of wealth and relaxing. Now the ordinary life will start once again. The ordinary daily work. And so started a new day when everyone returned to work as poor as before. Before the sun was even up, the fishermen once again set out to fish. To that vast sea. Just like before. And by the time the sun was up, the farmer was once again working in the field. And when the sun shone, the first fishing boats were returning to the port. Suddenly everything is busy, alive and, as before, everyone is nice to each other. And suddenly everyone sees that hunger and misery have disappeared, along with hate and selfishness. Happiness cannot be paid for by gold. And now everybody knows how to live and be happy. To do for others what they need with happiness as before. My dear swallows, all this really happened here while you lived far away in the north. Now we live here in happiness. We all work hard, whether in a field, in a workshop, at sea or on the island. We are all one family here. Everyday we help each other and we have had enough of gold forever. It only brought us problems. We know what true happiness is. Let the gold lay on the bottom of the sea. The end
