THE HUSSY This film received an award from the Philip Morris Foundation Sunday is Mother's Day. Write her a nice poem. Nathalie, read me your poem, please. "Best wishes, mom. I hope that you like my present. "I'll tell you a story. "You're pretty, like a loaf of wheat bread. "And you smell nice, like lavender. "And your thoughts are roses, like the roses of the forest. "And you will become an angel, with all those hearts, "I hope you'll be happy." Very good. Mado, you didn't write anything? I don't like my mother. Silence! Alexandra, continue. And speak up. "Mother, your love is stronger than the wind, "you, who forgive my mistakes, you who love me, "I love you, mother." Leave me alone. - Don't come closer, I don't know you. - But I'm not moving. - D'you want me to believe you? - I've never hurt anyone. You're not very kind. Not like the girl I saw on the way. She smiled at me. Is she your daughter? - What do you know? - I know her. I don't know you. If you keep it up, I'll slap you. Does she study well at school? She only acts stupid and scratches her pimples, nonstop. - Say, you're a good looking woman - Don't smooth-talk me. - Why, are you married? - Does it matter? Why don't you want it with me? Do you think I don't know how to do it? You're clinging. Come sit down. I'll heal your daughter. I have a gift for healing. I know how to heal burns. Pimples are quite the same. They're almost considered to be burns. My grandmother gave me the gift. I know the formula, I can tell you, 'cause without the gift, it won't help. "Fire, disappear as once Judas lost his burns in the Garden of Olives." Ask me to go to your house and I'll heal her. You can't, my boyfriend's there. I'll heal her anyway. I won't hurt you. I only want to talk to you. Let's take a walk. - Okay, but not in the forest. - Very well. They shouldn't see us. - Can I give you a kiss? - Only one. You see how good I am? - You don't seem bad, but I'm worried. - I've seen your mom. I told her that I'll heal your pimples and she agrees. But you have to come to my house. My house is nice, I have a TV. I have to tie you up, I don't want you to escape. You don't have a TV at home. I don't need to tie up your feet. - You can, but not very strong. - No, there's no need. They shouldn't see us. It's none of their business. No! Get out. I have to go back. You're heavy. I'm still scared. We have to return at 5:00. Hold your head in. If you move again, I'll kill you. Come on, dog. Come on. Mickey! Don't move. I'm scared. There's my room but it's not for two. I'll show it to you and you'll tell me. And there's only one bed. Does it matter to you if we sleep in the same bed? No, it doesn't matter to me. Go to corner of the house, behind the ladder and hide yourself. Give me your hands, I'll cut the cord. Hide. Go up the ladder. Don't make noise, go to bed, you're tired. I'm not hungry. You have to tell me what you like to eat. What would you prefer? I don't know. - Tuna. - Canned? - Shredded. - In oil? Yeah. Olive oil? I don't know, normal oil. And what else do you like? - Sausages. - Cooked? Cooked? I don't know, the red ones that come canned. The ones from Strasbourg? I don't know. It's the same with me. I'm nervous too. And if it rains or it's humid, it won't calm me down. Tomorrow I'll heal you. How old are you? 17. What's up? Nothing. Yeah, something's up. I don't like being told stories. What stories? You say that you're 17 and shave your mustache. You have to be 19 for that. That's not true. I started shaving at 15. You don't believe me? Me? I believe everything I'm told. Come, I'll take care of your pimples. Put your hair up. - Does it sting? - A little. There's nothing to do with it, my mom has tried everything. Talk more softly. A doctor came, we bought ointment, they tied my hands to the bed so I couldn't pick at it. But it doesn't come off, I scratch. Each time you pick at it, I'll give your fingers a whack. What do you want to be later? I don't want to be anything. I'd like to be a saleswoman, if I could. You can't stay here, you have to go to bed. I'll come back in five minutes. It records everything. When I'm not here, I'll be able to watch everything you do. I want to pee. "Just before the curve, "just before the closed curve, "just before the closed curve..." "Clos-e-d". I don't care, it doesn't count. "Clos-e-d"! I don't get it. You'll have to obey. If not, beware! Your mother told me I could hit you. She hit me with a belt. But she hasn't done it for a while. When she hit me, I said nothing, I didn't cry. So what's the use. For what I want to be, a dictation won't help. Only arithmetic matters. And I know how to calculate, I don't need to study it. Now I'm not in the mood to think about writing well. Write "E-D". If you don't get a diploma, you won't be anything, I don't have it. - Is it necessary to be a saleswoman? - Certainly. We'll continue, but only a little. Put your name on the top, to the left. My name is Madeleine. Get on your knees. Why aren't you good with me? And why do I have to be? I can't tell you. Why? You're not the first girl to be abducted. Do you know who abducts them? The bosses. And that is the blood of a girl. The boss came up here and bled another girl before you. She was 12 years old. Who are the bosses? Those who give orders. Seeing them, you'll know that they're mean. You understand? It's not me. They steal the girls. A while ago they asked me to shave one, then threw her into the water. So you have to be good with me. If they hear you, they'll come up here. And they'll kill you. When I don't do what they want, they beat me. I don't want to stay here, I want to go. Go if you want. Go if you want! I'm scared! I think I'm going to cry. Go to bed. You just have to go. And where should I go? You don't know the bosses. As soon as I'm not at home, I feel sick. Because of the change of air. I'm not going to cry. We'll latch it up, and they won't be able to get up here. We'll latch it up, and they won't be able to get up here. At times I get strict, even though I don't like it. At times it's necessary to be strict. If not, you're a nothing. There are only crackers here. I'm going to go to work. I'll come back with food. You can't stay here. The bosses mustn't see you through the window. When you finish, go to bed. The bosses won't come up if they don't hear you. You don't need to be afraid. When I come back, I'll knock 3 times to show that it's me. Or I'll cough. You hear me? Do you hear me? Do you hear me? - You're making noise. - So then we'll talk quieter. - Knocking and coughing makes noise. - I'll knock softly. We'll have to put a cord through that hole. Over here? Yes. Okay, I'll put the cord through. I don't like chocolate with nuts, only with milk. I didn't know. It's nothing. I'll see if I can change it. Yeah, they'll change it for you. - Is Mickey the barking dog? - Yes. He's very bad. - Hi, Fran?ois! - Hi. It must be worth 12 francs. Anatole is there, go see him, I'll offer you a drink. Troublemaker! Get out, troublemaker! You want to go up the ladder today? Let's go, down. Down. Home, let's go. Inside. I came to take back my clock. - What's that? - It's not yours, it's my dad's. What was his is now your mother's. - The clock, no. He gave it to me. - How can you say that? Yes. Just ask Claudine. What would you do with it in your shack? You don't get up for work. - It's not my fault I've no job. - There was work at the chicken factory! You had to get up at 5:00. But you're just too lazy. I'm not a thief! I'm not a thief! Layabout! It's me! Open. Madeleine, are you there? Let me in. We agreed about the cord. - Let me in. - We agreed about the cord. If we say the cord, then it's the cord. As long as they don't call me a thief or an idiot, anyway. - There were shouts down there. - I'm not a thief, it's my clock. - Did the boss hit you? - You'll see. If he comes up, I'll kill him! Like a rat! Go down and kill them. Are you crazy? - Do they know I'm here? - No. They didn't want to give back my clock. - The boss is your father? - He's my stepfather. My mother agrees with him because he doesn't want to give it back. And we fought. Since he came, I just have to shut up. He always says 'I'm giving the orders'. He wants me to go, but it's my house, not his. He turned my mother against me. I don't even talk to my sister when she comes. She probably didn't speak much to you anyway. Did you drink too much? I'm not used to it. I only drink lemonade. I can't drink much cider. Do you know what you're going to do to please me? Do you want to please me? Yes, I do. Go down and make peace with your mother. No. So you don't want to please me. No need for a speech, just say you didn't mean to hit her. I want to please you, but I don't want to do that. I want to give you a gift. If you want, I'll give you the clock. When I go, I won't be able to carry it, it's too heavy. That's not heavy. Then I don't know what is. I'll accept it anyway, you'll just have to bring it to me. Write a note to your mother and give it to her. So you don't have to talk. You're a woman for sure, you're stubborn. Go down, say it through the door and come up quickly. It's not hard to say: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit you." I don't feel like it. Come on, then we'll have a cuddle. Come on. Come on! I can't! I'm sorry! Turn around, we'll sleep this way. In your house, are they bad to you? They tied me to the bed. You mustn't be pushed around. Did you see this afternoon? As soon as I'm old enough, I'll getting out of here, to Vire. One day the neighbor gave me some shoes. They wouldn't let me put them on. I'd wear them out. So I put them in my schoolbag and on the road I put them on anyway. You know, the bosses don't hit me because I resist. But they're still mean. Let's stop talking and sleep. We'll sleep well like this. I like the way we sleep. We're like sardines. One small sardine and one big one. You're the big one. Silence, we're sleeping. It's really windy tonight. I don't want you to go so quickly. Only lazy people leave like this. And if someone asks me something... I'm not lazy. Stay with me today. I have to work. Who will buy milk if I don't? I haven't asked for anything, I like cider as well. In the morning? - Not the morning. Don't exaggerate. - You see! Do you earn much at work? I sell old cardboard at 20 cts. a kilo. Old paper and scrap metal at 30 cts. a kilo. And then there are mushrooms... that I collect. Make me laugh a little. You see, you can if you want. When I went to school, there was a boy called Fr?d?ric. We used to play and touch each other behind the playground. Why don't you do it to me too? I like it. I'm going out for milk. Come in! It's for later. For dinner tonight, guess why. Because we calmed down, it's a cake for me. I don't know. The bosses are going out. They won't be around tonight. We'll watch TV. And I bought nice things for you to eat. It's St. Madeleine's day. - Can I see? - No. I want to see! - Only once, to see what's in there. - No. - Are they tins? - Just once. You're not much fun. Tell me something. Whatever you want. I don't know. I always start the conversations. Don't you want to get married? It depends. I'm not a fussy guy, but it depends. Do you have a fianc?e? Yeah, I have one. - Is she cute? - Yeah, she's good. You got a photo? No, I don't have one. - You don't want to show her to me. - No, she just didn't give me one. If you don't have a photo, you don't have a fianc?e. If you have a fianc?e, you always have a photo. I'll go get one for you, if you want. If you want! It's all the same to me. I'm gonna see if they're going, I won't be long. About that TV. If it's not true, I'm going. I didn't tell you but I've thought about leaving. He didn't want to give the key back but he's too stingy to change the lock I didn't hand it over. Don't touch anything. Leave it to me. - Are you sure that it's the key? - Yeah. The TV works well, we'll watch it quiet. So the neighbors don't hear us. I forgot the sausages! You could have reminded me. - You'd forget your head if it was loose - I'm gonna find them. - I don't hear anything. - It's time to go to bed. I'm getting up early tomorrow. Not me, I'm on holiday. Go to bed, I'll lock up myself. You haven't been nice. Why haven't you been nice? Has Madeleine been bad? Has Madeleine been bad? - Has Madeleine been bad? - Yes! - Then you too. - No. Then, I'm nice? - Don't laugh. - I didn't laugh. - Yes, I saw you laughing. - No. Yes, you laughed, You're so stubborn! You're so stubborn! - Why did you wake me up? - We have to talk. - You could have been more gentle. - You disagree with everything I say. I didn't say anything. I don't want to argue at all. If I say I have a girlfriend but no photo, don't argue with me. You won't do dictations, you don't wash, you don't comb. You don't collect anything. - Maybe I hit you also? - Yes, last night. Have you seen your hands and mine? I'm the one who's hurt. You're always arguing. - And if not, then you're sullen. - Not always. It's true, not always. - I give the orders here. - You're not much fun. Okay, you give the orders but remove the camera then. It's too heavy! Who gives the orders here? You, but help me. I'll do it later. - Will we watch TV today? - The bosses have come back. - Hi. - Hi. I'd like a photo, it's for my girlfriend. In 9 by 13? The standard price? Can I see it? If you want. I only want to know the price. She doesn't like photos taken of her, when she sees this, she'll accept, and I can bring it. And I'll return the photo. Sir, I can't, these are photos of clients. I'll return it! And I'll bring her to take a photo, I swear. I have to tell you something and I don't know how. How will I say it? My dad went away a long time ago, and we haven't seen him since. So I don't have a father. Don't do anything, I'll take care of it. So I decided to call you Dad. - Are you glad? - Yeah. Of course, I won't always call you Dad. When I feel like it, or when you're nice. I didn't know how to tell you. You can give me a nickname too. If you want, if you'd thought of something? At home they called me Mado. The rillettes are good. You can start. Enjoy your meal! Enjoy your meal! My name is Fran?ois. We only need flowers. We'll have to find some. If they see me with flowers, they'll laugh at me. Make sure they don't see you. If you want, I'll bring cider today. You like it. Yeah, but I'll be a little tipsy with it. I'd like you to bring me a piece of chalk, to play with. I didn't want to show it to you, but better if you see it anyway. Do you love her? Maybe she doesn't love you. For your work and because you don't have your own place. That's important for older girls. The same thing happened to me last year in school. I liked a boy and and I didn't tell him. And one day, we played a game where we said who we thought about. He named a girl I didn't even know. I'm sure he secretly loved her. Then there was a boy who liked me and I didn't even know. And he told me. Well, he told me in that game. I didn't like him much. Imagine, the boy who named a girl I didn't even know. Are you there? Yes! How nice! Your sister is coming Sunday, she'll be able to have a look. We had a narrow escape. - She must have seen the table. - She saw nothing. I feel like I'm having a heart attack! Listen, sometimes, it stops... One day, it'll be tired of all these stories. And it'll stop altogether, I don't know how it can continue. It's beating quickly, but it's not stopping. I don't want to see her again. We're both funny, odd people, the pair of us. You think they'll come on Sunday? They're just making fun of me. Well, listen to me. It's a house for laughing. not for laughing at. Truly for laughing, you understand? Of course we'll laugh quietly, because of the bosses, but it's for laughing, having fun. forgetting your problems. Come in. Come on. That's the big cupboard to lock up all your problems and sad things. Put in some problems. Just pretend, as if they were invisible. For example, do like this... Do it, do like this. Come on. When you have something funny to tell me, I'll see everything and figure out how it ends in advance. When you're vexed and don't want to tell, I'll read it on your forehead where it's written, and if the boss vexes you once again, I'll tell you. And you'll say, "yeah, how did you guess it again?" "It's written," I'll tell you. It'll make you happy, you'd laugh. It's a bit stupid. You're stupid. I'm making an effort. Because after lunch, I don't feel like laughing. You could also make an effort. You're not fun. Erase it, if you want. Erase it yourself if you don't want me to erase it. You're horrid. I'm fed up with this. I'll never talk to you again. If you want to denounce me to the bosses, do it. That's a big coin? I'll agree to talk to you even if we won't make up. I've something to tell you. Sit down. I've thought it over. I want a baby. Make me a baby. I'm bored all day long. Are you crazy? You're too young to get married. My sister has one, she's not married. You can't have a baby at your age. Do you know how they're made? It'd hurt you too much and it wouldn't work. You're a wimp, a complete wimp. You know nothing about that. At your age you can't have children. You're just crazy. Why? You can't until 15. Before it's not possible. - Many girls have them before. - You know nothing about that. Do you know any better? I'd be surprised! You're weak. It wouldn't be a good idea. Let's go to the market. I'll get the motorcycle. When I reach the boss's place, lower your head, and get down in the trailer. Hide in the corn. I'm going to the market, I'll be back soon. You'll get some fresh air. You're crazy not to go. What is that girl doing? What are you doing there, on the road? I don't know you, child. Throwing stones at a poor old woman! What a shame, to see that on the roads! Come in. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. No need to come every fortnight. It won't change anything. There's no work. I was passing by. It costs me nothing to ask. I'd like a job in an office. We won't speak anymore about the baby. Never! At noon hit him round the ear. Then she'll understand I exist. When my sister comes, tell her not to come up. Leave me alone. In the morning you can tell me something. Something nice. Does your ear hurt? Why would it hurt? No. I have to tell you, I'm much better. Suddenly they're gone. I have no pimples anymore. It's all healed, look. I told you I'd heal you. You see, I have a gift. But you wouldn't believe me. Are you happy? Yeah. But you have to try not to be so stubborn. - Have you eaten? - No. Thanks. Look at me. If you want us to continue, you have to make an effort, okay? Okay. We'll see. To show me you agree, I've found a pledge for you. You'll write me a poem or a story. Choose one. Choose. A poem. I've got another nickname for you. Cold-blooded. "Sangfroid Fran?ois," get it? Also, I'll call you "hot-blooded." It's a good thing I can tell jokes, isn't it, Cold-blooded? The eczema has put me in a good mood. I'll keep writing my story. But I won't talk to you about it because nothing interests you. You can talk to me about it. I'm hesitating between the story of a girl called Charlotte and Zorro. Do you know Zorro? If you have something hard to do, ask Zorro and he'll do it. Or call me "little Zorro" and I'll do it. Does Zorro cure pimples? Nonsense. That's my sister and brother-in-law. I'll go down so they won't come up. Hide Hey mom, how are you? Hi! This is for you. - Is Norbert doing well? - Very well. - Thank you very much. - Come in. You should congratulate him about the pimples. And tell him not to get annoyed by the bosses. And you, tell me softly: "Zorro, I love you." Well, is there a castle up there? What time are visits? Good heavens, this isn't any better. Come on, let's go. Come on. It's a funny poem. "Jesus, you who started from scratch "Who put vitamins in the cakes And sardines we catch "So that Mado can always look fine "And that young men surrounding her "Will always have good character" That's it. It's not long, but it's sweet. Come here. Do you want to put your head here, on my knees? So rigid! Turn around. It's so hard for you to relax. You should do like your mother, chew some gum. I saw her by the window. Not everyday, but there are days when I like you very much. Close your eyes. I don't like short hair but on you, it's good. If my mother could see me. Fran?ois! The police came about your motorcycle insurance. You didn't go to see them with a receipt. And you haven't paid. You'll be fined. Take it tomorrow morning. 20 days in jail. Aren't you ashamed? 20 days inside, if you don't pay. Leave me enough food while you're in jail. 20 days isn't much. Does Mado really want to stay? That's nothing but lies. And Fran?ois, does he really want her to stay? You're healed. I'll return you to your mother. Is it true? About the cops? The cops, It's a story, made up by your mother? You cried because you like me, - and have to give me to the boss. - That's not true. But it is! You're crazy! Why are you upset? Tomorrow I'll take you to your mother, I said I would when I healed you. If you want, I'll take you right now. Do the bosses know where my mother lives? No. They know nothing. If they know, I'm moving, so they don't find me. Swear by something that you'll never tell them. By the head of Mado. I swear. I believe you. When did you like me most? I don't know. When you called me "Dad." I'll have a quiet sleep now. Do you want...? Where are we? Try to hitchhike. Don't tell them where I live. I won't tell. They mustn't see us, come on. It's a gift. Here. You don't see anything? Look. I've written something down. Read it. I THINK OF YOU It's a bracelet. Put it on your wrist and then you'll think of me. After prison, come see me at school, will you? Madeleine! That's not how you told me. And you, Fausson, did you take her away so gently? Don't pull my leg. Come on, once again. Don't hold my hand. He won't hold my hand anymore. At your place. - She was the one who held my hand. - Come on, Fausson. Let's pretend I'm dead.
