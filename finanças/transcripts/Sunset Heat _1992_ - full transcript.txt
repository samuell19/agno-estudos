Holly will help you. Holly will help you. No, she won't. That bitch. I'll beg forgiveness, she likes that. [coughing] [gasping] Jesus Christ. [melancholic music] (Carl) 'I get a call in the middle of the night' can't go back to sleep. And I write this poem, now listen to this. '"I used to hear the waves crashing in the distance.' "Now it just sounds like freeways. "I used to listen to music to help me sleep. "Now music keeps me awake. "I used to dream about a woman. "Now I've forgotten her face. "The mystery is gone, the mystery is gone "and it's not in the wine, it's not in the powder it's not like before. The mystery is gone." I wrote that this morning. Cook, good morning. Wait inside. Don't you think it's a little early for poetry? It's never too early to arouse a soul. Did you find your money? It wasn't my money that ran across the parking lot. We hadn't completed the transaction. Well, did you take care of our little problem? Not yet. Track it down, Cook. That's what good cops do. Try to keep up appearances. [birds chirping] Yeah, well, there's a bug in the ointment. And it's a bug you know. The guy at Rollins' house was definitely your former partner. Eric Wright. Are you sure about that? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. He was seen last night at the Army Club. Had words with Julie and left with the redhead we iced. 'I put an APB on his red Corvette.' I'll talk to Julie. You find Eric. [birds chirping] [knocking on door] (Eric) 'Julie.' I told you, I didn't wanna see you anymore. I know, I'm sorry. I need your help, Julie. You need a loan, go to the bank. - Wait a minute? - Go ask your redhead for help. - Would you let go off the door? - She's dead, Julie. Will you just cool out? Just walk away, man. - David, put that gun down. - She doesn't wanna talk to you. So now, go. Walk away. Give me this. Enough of this shit, okay? What are you doing? Julie, listen, the cops killed that girl. I need your help to find Danny. And I gotta use your car. You're doing it all over again, aren't you? 'Julie, please, just get your keys' 'follow me with your car, okay?' 'Please!' Please. 'Shit!' C'mon. You know, your sister can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. She's still mad at you. She is still stubborn as hell. [engine revving] [tires screeching] Eric, that's my gun. David, what are you doing with a gun? - It's my dad's. - Put it in the glove box. [tires screeching] Where's a good place to dump this car? There's a place a few miles up. Show me. [engine revving] [lively music] [music continues] 'Julie, bring me your keys.' You are out of your fucking mind. 'Forget it. I've had enough of this shit.' Bring me your Goddamn keys. What are you doing? Help me out. Come on, help me out. Bring him the fucking keys before he blows my head off, he means it. Come on! [grunts] Thanks. Listen, David, I'm sorry but you're gonna have to hold for back to the house, okay? - That's cool. - Great. Hey, Eric. She still loves you. Yeah. Look, leave the car, take the keys, here's your gun, okay? - Thanks a lot. - You got it. - You coming? - Ugh, it's my car. Look, pull the car over, okay? I wanna walk. - No, I am not pulling over. - Pull over! Pull the fucking car over! 'Happy? I pulled over, you wanna walk?' - I do. - Here we are, Julie. I'm not getting involved in your shit anymore, Eric. I don't deal drugs. I am a photo-journalist. - I pay taxes. - Bastard! How dare you point a gun at my brother's head? - He pointed it at me, Julie. - Oh, shit. Julie, only you can help me. You know everyone in town. - You gotta help me find Danny. - Forget it! - That hurt. - Good! I don't care. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't. Yes, you do, Julie. No, I don't. And don't flatter yourself. Listen, I don't trust you. And trust is as important as love and if you don't know what that word means, look it up. - They're gonna kill me, Julie. - Call a cop. The cops are the ones who killed the red head! [instrumental music] Don't say anything or I'll change my mind. [instrumental music] And don't touch me. [instrumental music] Drive. Mr. Madson wants to talk to you. He's got legs, can't he walk? Don't fuck with me, kid. I ain't got time for this. Come on. It's a lovely day. Yeah, it was. Why don't you like me, David? Oh, gee, Carl, I don't know. I mean, after all, you always treat me so good. Where's your sister? I don't know. Where is she? I don't know where she is. [pop music] That's her. You think you can handle it? I gotta go make a call. [music continues] I wanna work on the intro again. Can I help you? Yeah, I am looking for Holly. Why? 'I'd like to talk to her. If she has a minute?' - Yeah. - Yeah, that's right. 'Business or pleasure?' Kind of personal. So? I'm a friend of Danny Rollins. Hey, I don't want to upset you. He's in little trouble. - And I gotta talk to him. - He's in trouble here, too. He banged on my door last night and told him to get lost. Should have been here four fucking hours ago to direct this video. Any idea where I could find him? That's real funny. No. I don't know where you can find him. In fact, if you find him, tell him to eat shit and die. 'Excuse me.' 'Okay, that's it. It's over. Everybody can go home.' - Seems like your type. - Used to be. [indistinctive chattering] Doesn't that weasel have any friends. [chuckles] You're one to talk. I've got another place we can look. [ominous music] Oh, darling, that's upside down. No wonder they keep bouncing out. Ooh, you put on a few pounds since you left the DeLaurenti. Listen, you need to make the hoops bigger so it can accentuate your neckline. Listen, girls. You must be down for rehearsal in a few minutes. If you are not down here, I'm gonna use the whipping. You know, I would do just that, don't ever forget it. My, my, my, my! Just what I've been waiting for. what I've been looking for. That's beautiful, so fabulous. Oh, yes. Fabulous! Wooh! Eric, I heard that you was here. But you know I didn't believe it. Hey, Brandon? How are you man? So good to see you. - Hey, remember Julie? - Oh, yes. You always did have a good taste. Well, I wouldn't know what his tastes are these days, Brandon. Oh, really? Bran, have you seen Danny Rollins around? Is he here? I say he is. I don't know what you boys upto. But he rode that big hunk of his here this morning. Went up the stairs, hiding out in the office. And he won't come out. And he keep on saying, "don't tell anybody I am here." "Don't tell anyone I am here." Who does he think I am? Thanks, Brandon, I'll take care. Thanks. Okay, ladies. This is his bike. Danny. It's me, Eric. Hey hey hey. Hey, I knew you'd find me. 'How you doing, man?' You old rascal, you still need a shave. - Hi, Julie. - Hello. Ha, just like the old days, isn't it? She only leaves one cheap pile, I'll tell you what. Hey, Danny, what have you done man? Nothing we can't get out of. Eric, you're not gonna believe what I have done. Can we, uh, talk alone? She can stay. Come on, tell me. Tell me. I swiped a million dollars off of Carl Madson. - Why did you do that, Danny? - Didn't know it was his. Not that I give a shit. He's a slim-hearted bastard. [grunts] He did. Lena is dead. They killed her, Danny. And they shot at me. - I didn't know. - You didn't know? You didn't think they'd come to your house looking for you? Huh? No. 'Cause you don't think. You never fucking think. What are you doing stealing money, Danny, huh? I was broke. I needed the money. Hey, man, sell your house. I like my house. I'm glad they didn't get you. Danny, they're gonna kill you. Tell me what happened. One of them recognized me. One of them recognized you? Who else knows about this? Nobody. I hid the money. It's not just the money. There's a dead girl laying in your bed. What do you plan on doing about that? Getting my skinny arse out of town that's what I'm planning on doing about that. Unbelievable. You're un-fucking-believable. What do you expect me to do about it? I didn't kill Lena. She is dead, right? Give the money back. You're not just dealing with Carl. One of those guys was a cop. - Cop? - Yeah, a fucking cop. Now, forget it, even if I did give it back, they'd kill me. I am going to Jamaica. - Jamaica? - Yeah. - 'Jamaica?' - Yeah, come with me, Eric. We'll split the money down the middle. A million's worth ten million down there, man. No, I don't want to go to Jamaica. I like my life. My life is good. You always were so fucking superior, weren't you? Always so much better than me. Saint-fucking-Eric. - Give the money back. - No. What a piece of shit you turned out to be, Danny. I give up. Danny, Danny. If you just give the money back. Yeah, right. Yeah, pull the other one that's got bells on it. I am not giving it back. I wanna try one more thing and you'll never see me again, okay? - I think I misjudged you. - Yeah, well, that happens. What are you gonna do? We'll talk to Carl. I don't think you should do that. Look, Julie, he thinks I stole his money, okay? Do you know where I could find him? Yeah. Here, here, write on this. [instrumental music] I'm sorry, Julie. What's the matter? Nothing. [dance music] 'Just a little more.' [indistinct chatter] I don't want anymore. [chatter continues] 'You've always had great taste in women.' I know that. Bye, sweetheart. She loves that pool. Good to see you. Get into something a little skimpier. Oh, Christ. Hello. [laughs] Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my God! [indistinct chatter] Look at you. Look at you. God, forgive me. I love this city. Make sure he's alone. [dance music continues] Eric. Unbelievable. Hello, Carl. I see you haven't changed a bit. No, but I have. Yeah, you know... You don't look like you're having a good time. My party boring? No, no. Very exciting. Excuse me if I seem surprised to see you. Are you in town on business? No, I'm outta that business. Oh, that's right. What are you now? You're a phono-journalist or something, right? Yeah, something like that. Come on, Eric, you like, uh, like playing like a little kid in the street with a camera, huh? Yeah, I like it. It's legal. No one ever accidently takes too much. Yeah. Phono-journalist, it's not a bad thing. Like being a stamp collector isn't a bad thing. All the choices one can make in life. Well, if you like it, hey. Let me buy an old friend a drink. What would you like? I like to cut the shit, okay? Yeah, it seems that we have a problem, don't we? Look, we don't have a problem. I didn't take your money. Danny Rollins took your money. And a few kilos. Your problem is with him. I am here as a Phono-journalist. That's it. Let me ask you something, Eric. How do you plan to get out of fucking town? They're looking for the guy that killed that red head. You know, the one with the world's longest legs. You wanna know something? They think you did it. Yeah, they are looking to put murder one on you, buddy. Everyone's looking for you. Your skin is under her finger nails. Your finger prints are everywhere. Did you use a rubber? You did, didn't you? Way to go, pal. Safe sex. You should have taken the rubber with you because that's positive identification. Can we talk some place? Sure, man, I think we better, come on, man. Get you a drink or something? I could get you a drink. Come on, Carl. Why are you doing this to me? You know I don't have your money. Hey, any partner that walks out on me and disappears for four years is no friend of mine. Don't expect any favors from me. I am not Michael. No, you are not Michael. He was my best friend though. [phone ringing] Michael was your best friend, huh? I want my money, Eric. Get it. Hey, get it yourself, Carl. What? Excellent. It's for you. Yeah. [screams] Do you hear that? Do you hear that? 'That's your little fucking friend, man.' Have you got it? No? Ask him again. [choking] [screams] Okay. Not to worry. Eric knows where it is. 'Right?' [gunshot] Must have been disconnected. You're a fucking asshole, you know that, Carl? Now, you give me my money. And you get Cook's merchandise and you bring it back to me. Don't think that you can slip back into New York. 'Cause I know where you live. 422, West nine street, apartment C. I know where you buy your groceries and I even know where you get your fucking film developed. Now, I want my money. And you got 24 hours. Carl, listen to me. I don't have your money. I have no idea where Danny stashed your money. But you know how to find it. I couldn't find it if I had to. Hey, you got 24 hours . Come on, back inside he's alright, he's a big boy he can take care of himself. We'll enjoy ourselves now. You've got 24 hours. [instrumental music] Hey, Eric. Man, you look like you could use a drink. Yeah. [indistinctive talking] 'You're here to see Julie?' Yeah. She's in the office. I'll go buzz her. Oh, leave the bottle, okay. [instrumental music] - You okay? - No, I am not okay. Let's go sit down. [instrumental music] So, what did Carl say? Did he believe you? They killed Danny. Oh, my god. Carl's out of his fucking mind. What did he say? 'Wants me to find his money but he's killed the person' who knows where it is. - I got to get out of here. - Oh, wait wait a minute. - We could go to my house. - 'Fine.' - Mathew, I'm going. - Okay, goodnight. Goodnight. [instrumental music] 'Goodnight, Julie.' (Julie) 'Thank you.' & You know that I want your love babe & & logic says you can never have it & & My defences say I didn't want it anyway & & You know sometimes I am liar & & If you ever want me to love you & & you ever want me to care & & It's just what I've been through & & Nothing like what I'm going through && Holy, shit. Hey. - Hey, Eric. - Hey. David, make Eric some food I am gonna go freshen up. - It's alright, continue. - Eric, you need some food. Yeah, it's no problem I can make you turkey sandwich. What have I been doing? I'm a Photo-journalist? Hey, let me ask you a question. Are you and Julie gonna get back together or what? Fuck, if I know. 'Cause you're the only guy she'll act normal around. - Do you know about Carl? - What about Carl? I hate that guy. You know after you left. She goes into the closet. She gets out these pictures of you and her from over the years. Packages them packages them and she takes the cart box empties it out, cleans it and she puts it right there in the middle of the living room floor. And she starts making cat litter. Of all the pictures. I swear in god packages and packages them. And then there was one picture I saw of you naked. - It was funny. - Why? Well, I don't mean that the picture was funny. What she was doing was funny. She tore it, like some sort of ceremony or something. Eric, you bastard, oh oh oh. She did that, huh? It looked funny when she did it. - Oh, my god. - It looked funny when you did. Then she saw that picture you had in Time Magazine. Yeah what did she think about that? Holy shit, she was so fucking angry. (Julie) 'How angry was I, David?' Oh, I gotta go watch some pro-wrestling. Oh, good idea. - Thanks for the sandwich. - Goodnight. Enjoyed your sandwich? [phone ringing] Oh, it'll be the club. Hello. Umm...yeah. Yeah, just got home. 'No, I'm really tired. I am just gonna go to sleep.' 'No no, it's not that. Listen can I call you tomorrow? No, I am just really tired. Okay, goodnight. I know. Me too. Goodnight. Sorry. Shouldn't lie to your boyfriend, Julie. You're doing really well for yourself. I'm proud of you. Thanks. I had some help in the begining. Friend of mine co-signed the loan for the club. But I made it a success. Kinda hard to believe, huh? I even surprised myself. I don't find it hard to believe. Your friend...is he in love with you? Yes. It's kind of complicated. He was there for me when you left. Running the club kinda helped me clean up. Once I got cleaned, I looked at him and then I realized he wasn't who I thought he was. I've been trying to break it off but he won't have it. Why did you leave? I had to. Why did you leave me? Everything was getting so distorted. Carl, Michael and I... were making more money than God. But there's Michael, he's jammin' three grams of cocaine in his arm every day. Carl's playing around dealing guns. Holly's snorting in an ounce of blow a week. We were all doing this crazy stupid shit. Michael OD's, my own brother OD's and all Carl can say is "Hey man, that, that's just part for the course, man." If I didn't get out when I did I'd be dead right now. Why didn't you take me with you? You didn't want to go. What do you mean, I didn't wanna go? I was so angry when you left. When I didn't hear from you. I-I thought you were dead. Until that picture of that little girl on time magazine. I'm sorry, I-I gotta go. Eric. Eric. Take me with you. - No. - Why not? By this time tomorrow half the city will be tryin' to kill me. What's the real reason? What do you want from me, Julie? I want you back. [instrumental music] ["Every time I kiss your lips" by Geoffrey Leigh Tozer] & I & & been down this road before & & I think you get my meaning & & What we've been through & & Doesn't matter anymore & & What really counts & & Is just a feeling & & Every time I kiss your lips & & Every time I touch your face & & Every time we get close & & Is like the first time for me & & And every time I see your eyes & & Every time I hear your voice & & Every time we make love & & Is like the first time for me & & I could've said & & I've never been in love before & [camera clicks] & You know the story & & Don't let the past get in the way & & Of somethin' good & & Don't you look back & & Or you'll be sorry & & Every time I kiss your lips & & Every time I touch your face & & Every time we get close & & Is like the first time for me && Oh, yeah. What? I got to deal with this man for a moment, baby, okay? You wait for me inside, I'll be there in a minute. Alright? - You want me to leave now? - Yeah, now. I'll be right there. Just trust me. 'You got my money yet?' - No. - What do you want? I got something you're not gonna like, man. I don't wanna see it. Yeah, you do. You better stop bringin' me bad news, Cook. It might not be healthy for our relationship. Oh, God, damn. I want him. You got him. Hmm, Eric, Eric, where you going? - I gotta go. - Don't go, Don't go. I gotta go, Julie, I can't stay here. I'm never gonna leave you, baby. Don't worry. Okay. Don't fuckin' move. (Julie) 'Huh, God oh, my God.' I'm sorry, Julie. Da-David.. 'Well, look who we got here.' You're little buddy Danny was a total pussy. But I got to hand it to him. He kept his mouth shut. [intense music] Get dressed. Get in the car. You must like to live dangerously. Your 24 hours are now 12. I told you to get in the car! I meant everything I said to you, Eric. Somebody get this slut out of my sight! Wait! You left. You didn't give a shit what happened to her. I did. I took care of her. I co-signed for her fucking club. You.. You fucked my old lady. I didn't know. Eric! - Carl, don't! - Bitch! You know now. Get her out of here! You got 12 hours, pal. And you... I never liked schmuck. Hey. What's the matter? All messed up and no where to go. - Eric, put this on your lip. - Forget it. Here, shirt. I need a car. - Where are we going? - 'Pekon Union.' - Where's that? - 'Downtown, L.A.' - What for? - I got to see an old friend. - I need a gun. - I have a gun. Not that gun. I need a real gun. - I'm really good with guns. - You know how to use a rifle? Yeah, I used one at ROTC. When were you in ROTC? - High school. - High school. Great. Hey, hey. How come you never told me about Carl and your sister, David? I was afraid to. You had my car in there all this time. Yeah. 'What was I gonna do? Just leave it up there?' - Someone would have-- - Forget it, just get in. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Hey, excuse me, brother. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] Relax, Eric. Some of them got to be honest. One honest cop I know gave me a ticket for a 175 dollars. [chuckling] Go ahead, give her a kiss. David we're here. - Sup, man? - Hey, man, where've you been? Out of town. Hey, you look great. I see you've maintained that waistline, huh? Yeah. Hey, look. I heard about your brother, Michael, man. I'm sorry. This is David, he's a friend of mine. The new right hand, dude? (Eric) 'Something like that, yeah.' What can I do for you? - Tikki! - 'Yeah.' - Watch the rigs. - No problem, Jimmy. So, you back in business. No, this is private. - Private like in a 3-5-7. - Private like in a 3-0-8. For him? Hey, he's the best. ROTC. Show you what I got. I got shotguns and long guns. I got die hard and two medium models. I got the whole Rambo line. I got a gun so big, it will bust a Robocop. Gentlemen. Check it out. (Eric) 'Well, Jimmy, I see business is booming.' 'See something you liked, David.' You got a model 70 Winchester with a big red fume. Uh, yeah. [screaming] I hope he never fuckin' calls. I wanna kill you so bad. [phone ringing] What? It's me, Carl, I got your money. You know, I like that. Bring it to me. Oh, you want it? This is how you get it. You meet at Matador beach in one hour. You know where that is? Yeah, I know where it is. Good, then be there in one hour with Julie. You got that? No, guns, Carl. 'One hour, Carl.' One hour. But I tell you somethin', pal. I'm through fucking with you. Good for you. What the fuck are you looking at? Now, we get the money. I'd like to mess you up. So fucking bad. Oh, I'd like to mess you up. Fuckin' lover boy, uh? Oh, your fuckin' lover boy, huh. You slut! The fuckin' shit I did for you. Your fuckin' hands tied. You gonna go see your fuckin' lover boy, uh? Hey. - Uh? - No. 'Fuckin' bitch.' Nothing here. He's not here. He probably got caught in traffic. [phone ringing] (male #1) 'Yeah.' It's him. Listen, mother fucker. She dies in five minutes, if you don't get your ass down here with my money. (Eric) 'I got it, I'm right here.' Get that fuck. - Hey, Carl. - What? I see anyone but you come this way or any guns your money takes a bath, you got that? Wait a minute. Come on, come on, shit! Let me ask you a question. What's stopping me from coming over there? And chopping your dick off, mother fucker. I got a pro with me. Oh, yeah? You got a pro with you? What have I got? A bunch of fuckin' amateurs? Do it. [gun shot] Shit! [gun shot] Shit! Fuck! Ha ha, hey. (Eric) 'Good shot.' I wanna see Julie, now. Get Julie out of the car. 'Lover boy is waiting.' - Out. - 'Ah.' Okay, now that we got that over. You listen to me, okay? Do you hear me? (Carl) 'Okay.' I'm all ears, pal. You see the blue towel in the middle of the beach? 'Do you see it?' Yeah. 'Meet me there.' There's a path off to your left just you and Julie, you got that? No. You take the money down there, and when I see it then you get your old lady, man. Hey, Carl. Your head is about the same size as a headlight. You know what I'm talking about here? So, either we do it my way or your boys would be scrapping you off to highway. We wouldn't want that to happen. Alright, you first. - Hey, David. - What? 'Stay down.' And count heads. 'Okay. Be careful.' 'Yeah, right.' [intense music] [indistinct talking] Let's go. Come on. [music continues] Keep it moving, keep it moving. Okay, let's get this over with. - You okay, Julie? - Hmm-umm. I'm sure the two of you have a lot you'd like to talk about. Untie her. Show me the money. - Untie her, you son of a bitch. - Untie her yourself. What do you want to do? Stand out here all day? We could. Okay. (Carl) 'Give me the money.' Let her go. - Fuck you. - No, fuck you. Give me the fuckin' money. - Let her go, Carl. - Fuck you. Just fuckin' do it! There! Give me the fucking money! - You're alright? - Yeah. I want to ask you a question. How do you fuckin' expect to get away with this? I got a question for you. How you gonna get back to your car, huh? - Shoot him! - Get down! [gun firing] [firing continues] Fuck. (Carl) Shoot him! Ah! Holy shit. [firing continues] [screaming] Eric! Shit. You son of a bitch. Eric! [firing continues] Where you going, man? - Fuck you! - Get back here! I'm out of here, man. Damn it! God! Damn it. God. You stupid fuck. [firing continues] Shit! Shut up! This is really pissing me off. Eric! [screaming] She's like you're mother and you wanna fuck with me? Get out of the fuckin' way. There you go, take it. Get up, get up. Fuck out of the way, Carl. I'll get you. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! Get the fuck out of the way, Carl. [gun firing] - Alright-- - Drop it! Police! Drop it! Throw the gun on the hood. Drop it! - Detective Cook-- - I know who you are. Shall I read you your rights? - Look-- - Up against the car. Spread 'em baby! Shit! Alright, you got it? - Here we go. - Yay. - Thanks, guys. - Thanks, guys. - You're welcome. - Hey, thanks, Brandon. Hope you have more luck with this hog than Danny did. Hope you have a good time in Broward too. - Take care. - Thanks. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Hey, folks, how can I help you? There's something wrong with one of my wheels you wanna check it? Sure thing, Son. - Be nice. - Right. That's strange. What is it? The gauge is busted. Just a second. Both your tiers ought to be flat. Oh, I checked 'em twice. This is the strangest thing I have ever saw in my life. Uh, never mind, never mind. Forget it. Julies, I think this runs like a million bucks. - No way. - Yeah. Oh, my God. I don't believe it. Really?
