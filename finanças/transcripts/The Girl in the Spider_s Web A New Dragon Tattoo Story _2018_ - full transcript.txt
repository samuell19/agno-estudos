Subtitles by explosiveskull Check. Checkmate. Your father wants to see you. Come. Lisbeth made it for me. You're such big girls now. Come, Camilla. I want to play a game with you. Camilla! Come to your father. Both of you. Come. Sorry about the things I said. It's all right. You know I've been under a lot of pressure, with the trial and work. Yes, I know. Just forgive me. I get a little insecure sometimes when you talk to me like that. Come here, have a drink. You know how much I love you, do you? Who the fuck are you? I'm a fan of yours. I watch you on the news. Peter Ahlgren: The CEO who beat up two prostitutes but got acquitted in court yesterday. Put me down! Hey, what are you doing? I'm accessing your bank accounts. Call security! I'm transferring 20% of your cash to these two girls. The rest, I'm transferring to your wife. Good evening. Security. Account number. Don't. Mrs. Ahlgren, is everything okay? 51912. Take your child and leave. He won't hurt you again. I can undo all this tomorrow. Mr. Chen has bankrolled your company for years. Isn't this his wife? Oh, my God, you like that. If you try to contact your wife again, this video will be sent to him. If anything unexpected should happen to her, this video will be sent to him. You fucking bitch! Who are you?! You should ask yourself that question. A string of vigilante attacks has rocked Stockholm. I don't know her name. I've never seen her before. The attacker's M.O. matches that of Lisbeth Salander, a local hacker with a history of aggravated assault. If my daughter and I had a message for her... I just want to say, whoever you are, thank you. This is a new era for Millennium. I want you all to realize that the only thing - holding this magazine back is your mind. - Shit. And people refuse to believe that it's in your mind. And you can feel it when you go into a room, and there are people there who don't have this knowledge. Don't be a child. 'Cause I don't wanna bend the knee, kiss the ring? Is that too much for "the great Mikael Blomkvist"? For what's left of him, yeah. Levin is head of publications now, and he deserves your respect. He bought my magazine, not my respect. Plus, he's wearing a cap. And... he has over two million followers online. How many do you have? What do you want from me? I want you to write again. Come by tonight. I'm having dinner with my husband tonight. Erika. It's for you. She'll be right with you. Lisbeth Salander has a pet. It's a lizard. I don't know if I'm happy for you or sad for him. Are you throwing all of this out? Yeah. It's trash. You have a sister. No. She killed herself three years ago. I can't believe you didn't tell me. That I had a sister or that she killed herself? Both. When our loved ones die, we tell our friends. There's an incorrect assumption in that statement. Yo. There is a client asking for the impossible. Interested? Text me. She worked for my father for years. He was a psychopath. Turns out... she was the same. I'm glad they're both dead. You have to go now. I need to work. If you have another girl coming, you can tell me. I have to work. They say time is the fire in which we burn. I'm running out of it. Yeah. So do you think it can be done? It depends. What am I looking for? The sum of all my sins. A 2725 byte piece of software. It's a single-incident file. It can't be reproduced, copied, only moved. And you want me to steal it for you. They told me I'd have control over it. But they lied. I realized too late that I had created an abomination. Please, help me. Drop-off? Tomorrow morning, 7:00 sharp. Meet me on the Centralbron, south shore. I'll be next to the train station. I've provided two levels of clearance. After that, you're on your own. Take military systems, for example. Since 9/11, all global defense systems are controlled by satellite networks, and such networks are all protected by the same quantum encryption protocol. A tool of the kind we're discussing here could effortlessly access the tactical and nuclear arsenals of most major world powers. Via his personal computer, a single user would be imbued with God-like power. What you're looking at here is what the Russians are claiming to be some kind of system security breach. This is a Russian Topol-M SS-27 missile. Cold-launched, three-stage, solid-propellant. It was wrongly moved into launch position a week ago. As Special Division heads, we urge you to come forward if this security breach is a result of any classified project you may be working on. Now, obviously, we respect the fact you don't want to jeopardize the security of your projects. The State Department has requested we cooperate any way we can... Oh, shit. Agent Needham? Anything to share? Personal emergency. Special Division doesn't mean you're actually special. I think it does. Shit. Sorry. Come on, come on, come on. Boom. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Program encrypted. To run Firefall, enter value for: "The snow comes early this year." To run Firefall, enter value for: "The horses stand silent in the fields." To run Firefall, enter value for: Help me! Aah! It's me, Balder. I think I made a terrible mistake. Hey! You did the right thing by calling me. I have a data-track on my program. So I know she got to it. And she won't give it back to you. Last week... she assaulted one of Stockholm's most respected businessmen. Emptied his bank accounts. Just one of many men she's targeted. I don't know why... but I thought I could trust her. I promise you. I'll do everything in my power to protect you. Lisbeth. Hey. You okay? I fucked up. I need your help. That's the first test of Project Firefall. It's a tool designed... to breach and control most online defense systems. Frans Balder developed it for the Americans... and he hired me to take it back from them. "Take" as in steal? I think he wanted to destroy it. Who's that? He's the man who stole it from me before I could give it back to Balder. And if you find him... what are you gonna do? I'm gonna take back what he stole from me. So you want me to help you find a ghost? You're good at that. I couldn't even find you for three years. You just vanished. And I... Flight 825 from Washington Dulles arriving at Gate 47. Mr. Needham. I'm afraid you have to come with us. NSA Special Division Edwin Needham. Former U.S. military. Field ops: Afghanistan, Mexico, Ukraine. "Special Division." Is that an American euphemism for "no accountability and no oversight"? I don't know. Um... I mean, I'm feeling pretty overseen right now. Look. I'm aware that someone stole something of high value to you. And I presume you're here in Stockholm to find that someone? But I'm here to tell you that that's my job, not yours. The NSA has no business on Swedish soil. Funny part about that is I'm not here on business. Pleasure. Is that so? Look, am I being deported? No. No. For now, you're just getting this. - A tourist guide? - If you engage in any activities not listed in that book, I'll have you arrested and put on the first plane back to Washington. Now have a nice day. You, too. You have to take care of this. Okay. And I need to borrow some gear. One day we'll talk about your interpretation of that word. - "Gear"? - "Borrow." - You need a hand? - No. What about Balder? Checked out of his hotel. Cell phone disconnected. But get this: Look who he went to. His last geotag showed him at SAPO Headquarters this morning. I'm guessing he thinks you stole this from him, since you missed the drop-off. That means she moved him to a safe house. Why? Balder's program had a FREAK encryption. He's the only one who can open it. That means these guys are going after him next. I find Balder... ...I find him. Hello, Lisbeth Salander. "Sofia Novak." The fuck happened here? Pow. You Vilma? 200 crowns a night. No pets. No drugs. No friends. I can show you how the heating sy... I got into the SAPO servers. They're keeping him at 774 Birger Jarlsgatan. There are two plainclothes officers in a car and several more uniformed officers on the premises. Careful, Lisbeth. August. Let's move away from the window, please. August. August, hey. Hey. You said it would be a couple of days and then I'll go back home to Mom. "A couple" means two. No, I'll tell you what. When this is all over, I promise that I'll take you back to San Francisco. And you'll stay with us. Yeah, of course. Why don't you go back to your drawing, all right? All right? - Whiskey. Neat. - Sure. I'll have the same. - Mikael Blomkvist. - Deputy Grane. What a coincidence. This is the man you should be after. Not Salander. Your friend Salander has perpetrated a cyber attack on the most important security agency in America. I don't really see how this makes her any less guilty. She doesn't have the monopoly on guilt. You should be looking for this man, too. What makes you think I'm not? Now, if you will excuse me. Yeah? It's Malin. I got a hit on the spider tattoo. Text it to me. Sure, sending now. You Milos? Do you know this man? He has a tattoo like yours. So are you a cop? No, worse. I'm a journalist. That guy, he's part of this group. Heavy people. Pretty much the worst psychos you can find in Stockholm. You used to work for them? What makes you think that? Your tattoo. This is a scar. - He cut it into me with a knife. - Why? I used to do photo work. Tried to sell him some good ones of a politician they were blackmailing. I pushed the price too much. This is what I got in return. You like it? I'm sorry. This is what you get when you try to fuck with the Spiders. "The Spiders"? They call him the "Otravitel." He's the worst of them. And if you wanna keep that pretty face, I'd stop asking about him. No, thank you, no. Tell me not to worry. - What do you mean? - I've seen this before. - Seen what? - You obsessing over Lisbeth. This is not about Lisbeth. Mikael. There were two key stories that made your name and built the magazine. The first you couldn't have written without her, and the second was about her. I think you are scared what would become of Mikael Blomkvist if there were no Lisbeth Salander. I'm sorry. - Lisbeth. - I haven't heard of The Spiders. They sound like the last people on earth you'd want to have control of Firefall. You alone? Do you want me to come over? Lisbeth. Tell me where you are. No. I wouldn't want to ruin your evening. Hey, who's this? The blonde there. Who the fuck are you? Ned the Bathroom Stalker. Listen, I need to get into contact with somebody you know. You know who I'm talkin' about. What did she give you? A phone? Some kind of contact? Yeah, she did. Okay, good. Now, listen, I know you think you're the only girl she fucking in here. But I got about three or four other girls I could be talkin' to. And that's just in this place. All right? So while I respect the loyalty, I gotta say it's a little bit undeserved. Bitch. "Bitch" is right. She gave it to me. It's the only way I have to contact her. Hope you find her. Boom. I will. Sal...! You fucked me. Fucking bitch! - Good morning. - Hey. - Did you find your Russian? - Russian? Maybe you misspelled it, but isn't otravitel Russian crime slang for "poisoner"? It's Russian? What are you doing? Here you go. They're from Holtser. Thank God. Freezing my balls off. - Who is Mr. Holtser? - Me. Lisbeth's father. He was part of a Russian crime ring. I'll come with you, but leave him out of it. No. Come on. That's a good boy. Safety first. Stop the car! August. You have to come with me. Don't. August. Go. Get in the car. Aw, fuck! I want to go back to my mother, please. "The horses stand silent in the field." "The snow comes early this year." You know the answer to those questions. You know how to open your father's program. I want to go back to my mother, please. Police believe that the killer has abducted the victim's young son and is still at large. The suspect has been identified as Lisbeth Salander, a Stockholm resident with a criminal history ranging from cybercrimes to aggravated assault. She is believed to be armed and highly dangerous. Mr. Needham. Was this area part of a walking tour in your guide? You know, I always thought a safe house was supposed to be, I don't know... safe? You're done crashing around my city like a wild boar. Arrest him. Send him back to Disneyland. You play whites. Your father taught you? He's dead now. Maybe I shouldn't think of him anymore. - Why not? - Because that's the past. He once said the past, sometimes, can be like a black hole. If you get too close... it might pull you in. And you disappear. I don't want to disappear. You won't. Who was that woman on the bridge? The past. Hey! Hey! You don't want to finish the game? Oh. Checkmate. It's okay. - He's a friend. - Hi, August. I'm Micke. It's her. I know. We need to talk. That's for you to keep. Until the rematch. 1,780,099. What's that? It's the answer to "The snow comes early this year." It's a number problem. Each letter is a number. So I figure out the big number, then I break it down into prime factors. Father said he made his program based on how I think. You think I'm a freak. No, I don't. Get some sleep. When I realized that the man that killed Balder worked for your father, I tracked all of his ex-associates. And every one of them seems to link back to Camilla Salander. She's been picking up your father's network where he left off. But now she calls them the Spiders. She worshiped that pig. And now she's become him. Lisbeth, you're bleeding. I know. Do it. It's done. I bet you can't wait to write a story about all this. About me... ...and my psycho family. Just like you did last time. Lisbeth. They need August to run Firefall. Without him, they have nothing. We have to get him out of the country. Out of her reach. His mother lives in San Francisco. But even if we did get him on a plane, that won't guarantee his safety. No. But I know someone who can. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Stockholm Arlanda Airport. What the fu...? Wanted suspect in Terminal 3. Follow me. Female. Wearing a bright pink hat. Back in the room. Back in the room. Lady, be quiet. Just relax. Hey, you. Stay in your cell! Passenger Needham, please proceed to Gate 45 immediately. Passenger Needham, please proceed to Gate 45 immediately. Salander. North end of the terminal. Personnel-only door. Tell me you got the boy. For now. I need you to get him back to the U.S. and make sure that he's safe. No, no, no. Not without Firefall. I have eyes on the American. Without August, there is no Firefall. You have to let it go. It's what Balder wanted. You don't understand what this is. I've spent years waiting for Balder to deliver Firefall. - I won't give it up now. - Think you have a choice? What I have is a responsibility to my country. Something somebody like you wouldn't understand. I understand how to open that door. Shit. - Freeze! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Agree to take the kid back to the U.S. or it stays locked. Or you could just jump. - Fuck. - Up to you. You! Stop! I'll get the kid out. I have your word? You have my word. I said, on the floor! Now! Get in the van. Dad? Hello? Hello? Why do you make yourself so ugly, Libby? I've imagined this moment for so long. I had a whole speech prepared. And now I'm nervous. I should've written it down. The boy is secure. Listen, a client is willing to pay us a lot of money for this thing. I don't care. Just shoot me. "Shoot you"? You're my sister. Besides, I have so much to tell you. Mikael. Someone always has to carry the pain, Libby. Well, now it's your turn. Bring her. Kill the journalist. Move. Go! No! Hey, man, you got some creamer? No, I do not. 'Kay. Please don't touch that. It's vintage. Yeah. Uh, when was it, '02? Took down Big Pharma with this bad boy. The King Pharma crash was done from a 7792. Actually, I did it from a 7770. But who's counting? You're Warchild? The Warchild? Yeah, I was for a little while. NSA pays way better. Way motherfuckin' better. - Creamer? - My boy. Heard that went well. Is that August's location? Where's she takin' him? Home. Hello, August. You know, a little birdie told me you know how to open your daddy's work. I need you to do that for me now. Hello? Anyone in there? You will help me. Soon. You'll see. Such a big boy. We need to share this with Tactical. Put together a team. Fast. Get inside. Okay. Camilla! How did they know? How did the Spiders know Balder's location? Your guess is as good as mine. You're the client. You're buying Firefall from her. Access by a single user to online nuclear weapons... Would you rather have that in the hands of the Americans, the nation that never missed a war, or us, the nation who never went to war? Now August and Lisbeth are paying the price for all this. They'll hurt him. People have taken the fall for far lesser causes, Mr. Blomkvist. Do you see him? Tracker puts August in the west wing. Status? 24%. Get out of there! Lisbeth! Give up. Breathe, Lisbeth. Would you like a glass of water? Please get her a glass of water. He needs to open the program for us. Would you please talk some sense into him? Fuck you. I made these just for him. I will start with this one, the red one. It will not kill him, but it will blind him permanently. The black one, though... he won't survive. August. You have to tell them. You have to trust me. To run Firefall, enter value for: "The trees fade in the mist." 13, 23, 31. 115,751. 1,943,629. "The trees fade in the mist." Access granted. Firefall online. It's done. I won't let them keep it. Is that really necessary? I'll transfer the funds immediately. You don't have to. Why is that? It's okay. It's okay. You can't... Thanks for all your help. But I think we'll keep it. Calm down. You'll suffocate. Trust me, I know. You know where we are? This used to be Father's bedroom. Until it became mine, too. But you know that. There is something that you didn't know. When he died... an odd thing happened. It was like an awakening. I could finally see our father's true face: A monster's face. And I was nothing. Do you remember that morning that you jumped off the balcony and left me behind? The things he did to me that day. And the day after. And the day after that. For 16 years. And for that, Libby, I blame you. And so now the world will burn. And everyone will know it was you who lit the match. Goodbye, Libby. Okay. Uh... there. There. Targets down. Give me more. I got you, Warchild. I need to get you out... I have her. She's on the move. Where's the kid? Come on. Get up, Lisbeth. Yes! Move! Come on. There. Come on. House is clear. Where is she? She's on the other side of the house. She's leaving. Go. You should have visual on the car. I see her! Got her. Shit. Shit! On the move. She's on the main road going around the lake. Cut through the woods to intercept. Well done. Yes, ma'am. You can't blame me for leaving that day. "That day"? This is not about a day. It's about a lifetime. Are you not Lisbeth Salander... the righter of wrongs... the girl who hurts men who hurt women? All those lucky ladies... wives... mothers... sisters. I could never figure it out. Why did you help everyone but me? For 16 years... every day... you chose not to save me. I couldn't. I c... I couldn't go back. Why? You chose him. No! Oh, yes. Okay. Okay. Subtitles by explosiveskull
