Convoy's coming through at 0600. We need to secure this area ASAP. Roger that. This is where the drone last picked up a heat signature. We got ourselves a customer. Hmm? Drop it. Next time, you're the bait. Bandit three-four, area is secure. Repeat, area is secure. Roger that. On our way. Well, it's about time. Dad, is it happening? "Is it happening?" It's happened. Hey, you. Hey, little guy. Oh, wow. He's beautiful. Yeah. And he's already talking. Yeah? I think I heard him say, "Daddy better get his butt back here and help Mom change some diapers." Soon, baby. Just three more months. God, I love you so much. I love you, too. - Hi, Marshall! - Hi, Marshall! - We miss you. - What's going on? Did she have the baby? Yeah, look. Look. - No way! - Yeah. Congratulations, man. Oh, wow. Ugly kid. Definitely yours. So you think you're gonna re-enlist? I don't know. You think Sophie will stick around if you do? I don't know. Well, what the hell are you gonna do if you don't? I get it, you don't know. Sarge! Sarge! Now I know where I'd seen you before, sir. He won the 450 class at the Loretta Lynn in '15. Everyone thought Kurt Walker was gonna take it. Let me see that. Huh. That's a good picture. You've been holding out on us, Bennett. Could've gone pro, sir. What are you doing here with us? Uh... Riding for trophies didn't really interest me. Trophies? What about the money? Yeah, and the girls? I got a girl. And the money? Look, man, I always wanted to serve. When I found out I could ride for the Rangers, I knew that's what I wanted to do. Oh, no, I mean, I get it. I turned down a real high-paying job, too. Taco Bell, management track. We wiped this place out months ago. Satellite's showing intermittent activity again. You smell that? I do. Somebody's making lunch. Bandit three-two, on target, securing the objective. Let's move out. Riley! Riley! Stay down! Shit! Riley, stay down! Stay down, Riley. Hang in there. Bandit three-two, this is Alpha two-five. We have an eagle down. Repeat, eagle down. Under enemy fire at target location. Launch QRF! Repeat, launch QRF! Roger, Alpha two-five. QRF launched. Hold tight. You all right? You okay? - Yeah. - Come on. Come on. Come on, Riley, hang on! All right, almost there! You're gonna make it! Mmm. How are you feeling, Sergeant? Sergeant? Riley. Where's Riley? He's in surgery. He has been all night. They're doing everything they can for him, but... to be frank, it doesn't look good. There's something else I need to talk to you about. Now, we were able to save your leg, but you have multiple fractures in your foot. And there's no way to know if it will heal properly. Therefore, I'm recommending subtalar fusion of your heel bone. It's the only way to guarantee that you'll ever be able to walk again without pain. But? But, it will limit movement in your ankle, and you wouldn't be able to ride the same way. - No, thanks. - Which... Which is something I would discourage in any case. Maybe you should take some time to think about it. I don't need to. I'll take my chances. I don't think you understand the full extent of your injuries, Sergeant. Even if it heals, with the rod in your back and the screws in your leg, son, you're done riding for the Army. I'm recommending a medical discharge. I'm sorry. Bennett, the KX ready? Yeah, just about done. Dude! Dude, dude, dude! Let me help you with this thing. I had it. It's fine. Dude, if you get hurt in my shop, Sophie will beat me like a pinata, and I will cry, man. I'm a crier. - It's embarrassing. - Okay. Hey, you know who that is? I'm telling you, I'll be twice as fast. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - You okay? - Yeah. I just don't even feel it. - Nothing at all? - No. Doctor's not sure if I ever will. Just gotta keep doing the PT. Who's this guy? That's Kurt Walker's little brother, Chris. - He's racing now, too. - Oh, yeah? He any good? Uh, he's got a small sponsorship, - from my cousin, actually. - Hmm. He's gonna be racing his qualifier this year. He's nowhere as fast as you were at his age, I'll tell you that much. All right, let's go, babe. I'm gonna get a jump on that 650. - You good, bud? - Yeah, man. - All right, man. Thank you... - See you tomorrow. ...for a hard day. - Marshall, wait. - Sophie, I got it. - No, no, no, no. - It's okay. - Baby. - I got it. Stop. Go. Gimme. - Thank you. - Yep. Got it? - Sophie. - Cyrus. You good? Got it? Why don't you just let me help you inside? Are you sure? Okay, whatever. - Hey. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, buddy. - Hey, buddy. - How's he doing? - Ah, he's doing great. - Yeah? - Yeah, I've got him talking. What's this? What's this? - Tractor. - Tractor. Did you hear him? - Did you hear him? - It is a tractor. - That's right, buddy. - Nice job, buddy. Where's Daddy been? - Harley? - Want to say hi to Daddy? - You wanna go to your dad? - Harley. - Hey, be careful. - Come here. It's okay. - You all right? Okay. - Yeah, I'm good. - Hey. - All right. See the little puppy. Yeah? - Yeah, who's that? - Harley! - Steady, bud. - Harley! Harley? All right. I feel like that's... - It's okay. It's okay. - I got him. I got him. He's too heavy. He's been good. How you doing? - You know. - Yeah. - Another day. - Where's he going? Please try some of these for me, please. Just a little bit. Come on, please, just some... Is there any parmesan left? Stop, sit down, I got it. - Sophie, I can... - I got it. Hey, bud. It's okay. Did you hear from the VA yet? Thank you. Same as last time, it's being processed. Cal, I swear, when he finally does start to get his disability, we will be able to help out a lot more. Well, if this drought doesn't break, it's not gonna matter anyway. Price of feed went up again. Well, what are you gonna do? Nothing to do. We gotta have the organic feed to keep the organic status for the dairy, so... I might have to lay more guys off and get up earlier. Heard you coming in late last night. Is something going on? Had to replace the pump on the bulk tank. Oh, yeah? Well, you need a hand? - Babe. - Sophie, come on. Sitting on a stool fixing motorcycles, I agreed to that. I don't want you on a catwalk. - Son, it's not... - No, it's fine. I'm just gonna be another set of eyes. - It's okay. - Don't bullshit me. We both know you'll be up there in two minutes. Sophie, I've gotta stay active. I can't just be sitting around - all day. - No unnecessary risks! End of discussion. I just feel like maybe we can talk about it sometimes... I need to get ready for class. Thank you. I'm going outside for a bit, Marshall. Okay, Dad. It's okay. It's okay, come on. Okay, buddy. Want to go to sleep? Marshall? - Are you all right? - Yeah, fine. - Are you hurt? - No. - You sure? - Yeah. You need to go to the ER and get checked out? I'm fine, Dad. It's just, I... I just... I couldn't get the light fixed. It's just gonna take some time, bud. It's just gonna take some time. Hey, hey, hey... It's all right, buddy. - I just can't get the light. - It's okay. It's just gonna take some time, son. Just can't get the light. Yo, Bennett, are you done with the KTM yet? Why didn't you call me? I got it. What's for lunch? You ever find it weird you were halfway across the world shooting at Arabs and now you work for one? You think you might have ran into some of my relatives while you were over there? You're an idiot. No, seriously, my cousin, Makhmoud, haven't heard from him for a while. You think you shot a guy by the name of Makhmoud by chance? You know, unibrow, big nose, kinda chubby belly? He only dabbled in terrorism, so he's probably not worth your while, but maybe you can make a call or something. Now, I know you think us cornbread white boys don't know anything about geography, but your family's from Iran. And that makes you Persian, not Arab. And since Iran's part of Asia, you're actually Asian. Now I know why I love the ponzu sauce. Listen, man, I just wanna say thanks. For what? Giving me work. You know, things are slow around here, you don't really need me. It ain't all charity, kid. You rebuild engines faster than anyone I know, and since I pay you by the hour, - it kinda works out for me. - Yeah. Okay. Your leg's feeling better, huh? Getting there. You ever thought about instructing? You could charge 100, 150 bucks an hour. - Little more than I pay you. - "Little"? Kids would love to learn from you. There's so many guys doing it, I couldn't get anybody interested. Are you nuts? People see you out on the track again, the way you used to ride? That's easier said than done, man. Whoo! We might be closing early tonight. Why? Because it's Chris and my cousin, Amir Pasha Abula Gharahasanloo Roghieh, but he goes by "Tony Panterra." He's not here just to say hi to me. Is there bad blood? Mmm. I used to run his race team when we were younger, but he was a bit of a hothead. He kept getting into fights, and... let's just say, it didn't end well. Now, he runs his own race team. And when it comes to bikes, he likes to spend money, so... smile. So this is where dreams come to die, huh? Tony. Pleasant as ever. Cyrus. Still the, uh, delicate flower, I see? Pig didn't stand a chance. He still had his Big Mac in his hands. Bennett. Hey, Kurt. This guy used to give me a hell of a hard time on the track. - I remember. - Congrats on all your success, man. Thank you. Yeah, I heard you, uh, joined up. I was surprised. But, uh... hey, you made it back in one piece. So that's good. It's good to see you. So, what can I help you guys with? Need an A-kit for a KX. - Front and rear? - What do you think? Okay. Got a KYB kit right here. Follow me. I'm all out, third gear, break for the jump, then I cut tight for that left. They're always catching you in this section. I think you're getting too much air coming up Mt. Whitney. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. This ain't X Games. You gotta stay low. You gotta entertain the crowd a little. I know it makes you feel like a superhero, but it's actually just losing you time. - Yeah, yeah. - With the install, it's gonna be an $8,000 sale. - Oh, nice. - Keep the tires on the ground. That's how you go fast. Listen to your brother, dipshit. He's a pro. Yeah, and you're having to brake too hard, and then, also, you're taking that turn too late when you're coming off the left handy. You just have to make sure that you take it nice and tight. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Hey, you know, if you go wide and turn in late to that left-hander, you gain ten miles an hour coming out of the chicane. Yeah, but then you're leaving your inside open. Well, yeah, it's a risky move. A dumb move, if you ask me. So, if you guys drop your bike off tomorrow, I can have it for you by this weekend. Hey, you know, if it's just one guy behind, just let him right by, right? Then you cut in late, power out, and shoot right past him before the next turn. Look, Bennett, thanks, but, uh, I'm trying not to get Chris' racing lines all mixed up. Yeah, I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. It's just I did all right on that track. I'm just trying to help. Yeah, no offense, Bennett, but, uh, like you said, it's been a while. I think what Marshall's trying to say is that he laid down the fastest lap times in every race, so he kinda knows what he's talking about. Yeah, but Kurt did it as a pro. - All season. - Pro or not, a good line... - Cyrus, it's okay, man. - No, no, come on. Pro or not, a good line is a good line. You listen to Marshall, you might shave off some more time. - Okay. - I'll tell you what... um... hang on to that A-kit for a minute, and I'll get back with you. All right, come on, guys. Yeah. Ladies, we're out. You didn't have to do that, man. Screw them. You ready? Who's that? Who's that? So I was watching this teacher the other day, she was completely oblivious to what this horse was doing. It was exactly what you showed me. His ears were flickering back and forth. I told you there are things you're not gonna learn in vet school. Yeah, well, the horse was obviously bothered by something. Mommy thinks that it's because his assistant doesn't shower, and then he's stinky. He's stinky. You need a shower. You need a shower. You're quite a stinky. You're quite a stinky! You want a shower? I know, it's time for a shower. Come on, let's go upstairs. Say good night. Go to sleep, okay? Shh. All right, that's the last one. All right. Okay, set that one down, all right? Yeah, here's the leak. I need that crescent there. All right. All right. Okay, can you hold this? - Right here? - Yeah, right there. - You got it? - Yeah, go ahead. Okay. What's gnawing at you, boy? Kurt Walker came in the shop today. - Oh. - Yeah. What about you? I'm gonna have to sell this thing. What the hell are you gonna do without this? Not gonna matter soon. I'm behind on the mortgage. Why didn't you say anything, Dad? How much? Uh... Just a little over five grand. Yeah, okay, well... I mean, Sophie and I have at least - two in savings. - Yeah, well, you just keep it. If it don't rain, it's just gonna keep adding up. I wanted to leave this place to you guys. No, it's okay, Dad. It's... It's not all right, Marshall. It's not all right with me. Argh! Oh. God! Oh, I'm sorry. - Grease on my hand. - Yeah, it's okay. No, no. Oh, I'm sorry, buddy. Don't look broke. Oh, that hurts. Argh... - It hurts, Dad. - It hurt. See? Yeah. It's just gonna take some time. Well, hey. Hey, we're tired, and we're getting sloppy, so I think it's time we call it a night, and we'll talk about this some more tomorrow. - Yeah. - All right. I'll clean up. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah. Just check on Ray-Ray for me, please. - Will do. - Okay. - It hurts. - It hurts. - Night, son. - Good night, Dad. Ah... Oh, hell. Okay. Here we go. Come on, come on. Whoo! Whoo! Where is he? Shh. You suck. That is not funny. Oh. - Hey. - Hi. It's been a minute since you've waited up for me. I know. Babe, no, no, no, your leg, your leg. It can handle you, woman. It's fine. I packed on a couple pounds since Ray-Ray. Yeah, you're right, you have. - That is rude. - We'll have to work it off somehow. Oh, yeah? Okay. What has gotten into you? - I'll tell you tomorrow. - Okay. Instruct? So you want to get on a bike? I'd just be riding around with little kids, baby. But this is a risk that we don't need to take. We need the money. We're fine, Marshall. I really do not have time for this. Sophie, Dad's behind on the mortgage. What are you talking about? This is just a part-time job. It's a few sessions a week. It'll get us a lot of extra cash. No. Absolutely not. I will go back to work at the clinic. And stop school? - Who would take care of Ray-Ray? - We will get a nanny. - It's fine. - So then you'd be working to pay someone else to raise our son. You'd end up stuck at the clinic, I'd end up stuck fixing bikes, and that'll be it. I want more for us, baby. I want you to have your own clinic one day. Do you not remember when the doctor said "one bad fall," Marshall? One bad fall, and you could never walk again. Sophie, a car accident could do that, - but I drive every day, don't I? - I swear to you, if I see you on that bike, I will take our son and I'll move back to Illinois with my mom. - I promise. - Sophie. Come on, babe. Don't be late for physical therapy. Cyrus, I need you to come by tonight after Sophie leaves for school. - For what? - Need you to pick up my bike. I'm headed to the track Saturday, find some customers. That's a horrible idea. What time you want me to be there? Well, this sucks. Can't believe no one's at the practice track. But the REM track sure is busy. That feel all right? Yeah, go down two clicks. I'm gonna go sign in. Let's go race! Everybody down now! - Hey, Jimmy, wait up! - Hurry up, dude! Let's go! Let's go! Happy Saturday, folks, and welcome to another REM race event at Glen Helen Raceway. Only ten minutes left in this morning's practice session. Let's check it out. It's kind of busy for a local race, right? I haven't seen it like this in a while. Hey, Forrest! Forrest! - Hey. - Hey, man, how you doing? Doing good. It's a great turnout today. What's going on? Kurt Walker tweeted to everybody that he's gonna be here today. Is he racing? No, but his little brother Chris is. And everybody wants in to see if they can outrun the new rising star. Purse is up to four grand today. Do you think anyone's fast enough? Nah, nobody's gonna outrun the Walker brothers. I don't even like those entitled pricks. But they bring in a hell of a crowd. Hey, man, I gotta go. See ya later. Take care, Forrest. All racers, make sure to come sign in before 9:00 a.m. We picked a hell of a day to come to the track, huh? Yeah. Yep. So what do you want to do? I think I'll race. Yeah, okay. No. Let's see if you can make a lap first. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Roosting around is one thing. Going wheel-to-wheel is not smart for someone in your condition. - I need that money, Cyrus. - Dude, I promised Sophie. I know, I know. Let me deal with her. Oh, yeah, you're gonna be real convincing from a hospital bed. This is with or without you, man. This is a terrible idea. You're all set. Good luck. - Thank you. - Next. Marshall Bennett? Hey, Charlotte. Welcome back. Thank you. Stay out of the pack. And whatever you do, take it easy coming down Mt. Whitney. I got it. Man, the bike isn't even dialed in. It'll be fine. This is the last track I rode. Four years ago. Riders to the starting gate. We're about to start. Aren't you Muslim? Only in front of my grandmother. Today's race will be 20 laps, and boy, oh, boy, what an exciting 20 laps it's gonna be. All the local up-and-comers out to prove a point. Everyone has their favorites. Let's see who wins. Today's wild card is a ghost from the past. - Look who's here. - Local REM champ and winner of the Loretta Lynn, the 450 class in 2015. Haven't seen him here since then. Ladies and gentlemen, wearing number 32, it's Marshall Bennett. Hmm? - Did I hear that right? - He's dumber than I thought. Ladies and gentlemen, let's moto! And they're off! And Rob Pocius has the lead as they shoot down the front straight. The faster riders are already starting to break away. As they come around the back side of the track, Chris Walker closes in on Rob Pocius, fighting for the lead. See ya! And Chris Walker takes the lead! It was just a matter of time, folks. Oh, shit. I feel bad for him, man. It's a straight-up shame, bro. At the back of the pack, it's Marshall Bennett, struggling to keep up, while Chris Walker leads the pack into lap two! Attaboy. Oh, man, the local boys are giving it all they've got, but Walker is just pulling away. He's on a whole other level! Here he comes again! It doesn't even look like he's breaking a sweat. Chris Walker's proving to have some serious stamina here. We're halfway through the race, and the rest of the pack is running out of steam. Let's go. Good. Number 32 is moving up, no longer bringing up the rear. Come on. Look at this! It seems like number 32's finally shifted out of first gear! I don't know if I believe what I'm seeing, but Bennett is reeling in Walker. Here we go. And 32 sends it off the triple! Come on! Folks, this is incredible. Marshall Bennett shows up out of nowhere, passes the entire field, and is now giving one of our hottest up-and-coming racers a run for his money! Yes! Go, kid, go! He's right on his dumb ass! Not today! Walker is fighting hard. He will not let Bennett by. He's right behind you! Keep it going! One and 32 are just flying! Now they're starting to lap other riders. Last lap, folks. Wow. Who would have predicted this? Yes! Looks like Bennett has finally hit his limit. He had an incredible run, but he just can't get past Walker. Come on! Come on! Son of a bitch, I know what you're gonna do. Gotcha. Do it! Bennett passes Walker! I can't believe it! Yeah! Whoo! Oh, come on! Come on! Whoo! Yeah! Marshall Bennett wins the 450 Pro Class! Un-bloody-believable! What bullshit. Yeah! Son of a bitch! Yeah! Yes. Buddy, nice! - You okay? - Yeah. That was great. You done parade-lapping, kid? Look at that. - Marshall Bennett, number 32. - Thanks, guys. That's 32% off everything at Moto Mischief. - I'm gonna hit the bathroom. - All right, buddy. What do you think? I like it. It's a good machine. Can you do a little better on the price? Maybe. Excuse me, Earl. I'm gonna wait right here. Dad. What's up? You don't have to sell it, Dad. What? Why? I got the money. Phew. What did you do, rob a bank? Worse. I won. I'm gonna race again. Sophie. Sophie, can you please just stop? Baby, please. I can't just let him sell the house! What did you want me to do? You are out of your damn mind, Marshall. When you wanted to serve, I stood by you. When they sent you overseas, I stood by you. - Sophie, I understand that. - When you got injured, I stood by you. I bathed you, I emptied your bedpan! I can't keep walking around defeated, baby. I gotta be able to say that I tried. And what happens when you go down mid-pack? Because that's what's gonna happen. You're gonna end up - in a wheelchair, or worse! - I know. I... I know. I'd rather risk it than die a little bit every day. I almost lost you once. You can't do that to me again. Baby. - Sophie. - No! Just... Go away, Marshall. It's me, darlin'. Can we talk? Yeah, come on in. You okay? I hear ya. Come sit. Come on. Sophie, I was married to an Army helicopter pilot for 22 years. So... where you are right now, I've been there. Almost didn't marry her because I was so afraid that someday... I was gonna get a knock on that door. How did you deal with that every day? Well, it's simple. I just couldn't imagine my life without her. Pattie was in the Army all her life. So many deployments, they eventually just became routine. Till one day... She went down in a training exercise, of all things. I, uh... I know I seem like a tough old guy to you, but that day... God, that day, my heart broke. She was the love of my life, and she gave me Marshall. And everything that I am, everything good about me, really came from the time I had with her. So... if my boy is the one for you, don't let what-ifs control the decisions that you make. I'm surprised she let you come back. Let's talk. Okay, I need you to be straight with me. Is going pro a real possibility? Yeah. Lots of riders recover from injury. As bad as Marshall's? Doug Henry, Trey Canard, yeah. Some with more success than others. But what are his chances really? I don't know. You want me to look at my crystal ball and... See, no, that's not good enough. Marshall is not just your motocross buddy. He is the father of my child. We cannot bop around these little amateur tracks for a couple hundred dollars a race. Do you want me onboard? Okay, then look at me in my eyes, don't give me your Cyrus bullshit, and tell me what your gut says, please. You wanna know the real reason I hired him? Sure. Imagine you owned a piano store, and Mozart walked in the door asking for an application. That's how I felt when he came in looking for a job. My gut tells me that Marshall is one of the most naturally gifted riders I've ever seen, and I've been watching him since he's a kid. It's effortless for him. But can he still play? Yeah, from what I saw yesterday, I'll put money on it. I will sponsor him with everything I got. Do you even know anything about tuning a bike? I was the baddest crew chief on this side of... Perfect, you are crew chief, I am team manager. This is the deal I made with Marshall if you want me onboard. So, take it or leave it. We good here? I don't know about all this women-in-power stuff. Maybe it's my heritage, but in my country, women are seen, not heard. They're not even seen. Okay, so you need 60 AMA points to get your racing license back and go pro. The fastest way for you to do that is to finish in the top three in four qualifier races. Now, you've got the skill, but you don't have the stamina. If Walker would have gone flat-out the entire time, he would've had you. It's gonna take time to rebuild your strength. And the stronger you are, the safer you'll be. - All right, go for it. - Yeah? Yeah, all right. Your turn, Dad. No. We need you on an intensive regimen of low-impact cardio for a few weeks before you race again. And to keep our travel expenses low, we'll stick to nearby races. We'll get you the best gear possible, then we'll start doing some regular training on the track. Okay, so this brace is going to give you the most support and even more flexibility. How's it feel? - Yeah, it's good. - Yeah? You're still a little stiff. You've gotta get smoother. Practice those jumps, don't get too fancy, don't lay the bike too low. It's too risky a move. Focus on your landing. All purse money goes to you guys to help keep a roof over your head. Come on, Harley. - Boo! - Oh! You suck. Oh, I'm sorry, did I scare you? I am going to have to set you straight. Oh, yeah? You and what army? You got it? Yeah, I got it. Hey, look who showed up. Okay, I'm gonna get us signed in. - Okay, baby. - Thank you, baby. Team Panterra looking good! Hey, what's up, Dickson? - Hey, welcome, V-dog. - Who's that? That's Kurt's boys, the Team Irongrip mechanics. Do they have a masseuse in there? If they do, you're on your own, kid. What is he doing? As we get down to the last few minutes of the race, I don't see anyone catching Chris Walker today. He's been dominating this track. - Come on, come on, come on. - Come on! - And Walker takes it! - Yeah! Followed by Ashton, Lee, and Bennett! - Yes! Yeah! Whoo! - Okay, okay. That was good. Yeah! That was it! Good job, man. I hesitated too much. I got in my head. Baby, you beat 20 other riders. Fourth place, that's 18 points. Not a bad start. - You went right through. - You're on fire! Yeah! I'm proud of you, man. And it's gonna be Walker, McClane, and Bennett in the top three spots. Third place, that's 1,500 bucks. That's great. You were amazing, babe. I need to lower the back and stiffen the front so I can turn easier. Cool. No problem. I can go faster. Wow, folks, this has been a contentious race, with number one, Chris Walker, managing to stay in front of this tight pack. Go, go, go! Only two more laps, and Walker is finally breaking away. - Come on, Chris! - Come on! Here I come. Last lap. And I don't know if I can believe what I'm seeing, but Marshall Bennett is gaining on Chris Walker... - Shit! - ...at an alarming rate! I'm coming, I'm coming. Push, push, push! - You're almost there! - Come on, come on! Hold on! Whoo! Come on, push, push! You got it, baby! Go, go, go now! Go! And Chris Walker barely takes it with Marshall Bennett just a nose behind. - What a tight race. - Whoo! - Second place! - Oh, my God! - Yes, yes, yes, yes! - Yes! Bike issues? No, he's good. No, man, you just gotta work on some of your lines. You better think about your lines. Oh, yeah? Why's that? One more race, he turns pro, then you gotta deal with him. Great job, man. All right, team, Victorville is next, and as long as you finish in the top 10, you'll have the points you'll need. And we already have the sponsors' attention. Your hand, please, sir? Thank you. Come on. All of us, please. We haven't done this in a while. We never should have stopped. Dear Lord, we are always grateful for our time together. Thank you for this roof still over our heads, this food in front of us, and, most of all, good company. Even Cyrus. Amen. Amen. You want your veggies? Terrain's a little harder than I thought. - I think we can go down a few clicks. - Okay. Hey, can you grab the shock tool? Daddy, there's 32. Good eye, sweetheart. Hi, sir, I'm looking for Marshall. Hey, Sarge. Riley? Hey, man. Hey. Oh, it's good to see you. Sorry I didn't return those emails. It's okay. You're okay. I was in a bad way for a while. You know. Oh. Um, Rebecca has something she wants to tell you. Oh, yeah? Hey, sweetie. Thank you for bringing my daddy home. You're welcome, sweetheart. You got a good daddy. - Thank you. - Yeah. Of course. - This is my wife, Sophie. - Hi. - This is my dad, Cal. - Pleased to meet you. Hi. Little Ray-Ray over there, this is my good buddy, Cyrus. Name's Riley. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. How'd you know I was racing? Um... I've actually been riding again myself. Like, for therapy. Oh, yeah? Uh, with a veterans support group, VetMx. One of the guys saw your last race and mentioned your name. I didn't believe him at first. Well, it's good to see you, man. Bennett likes to take the outside line. He goes outside, you go inside. He goes inside, take outside. Right, I got you. You're quicker than him in the transitions. That's where you can yard him. Focus. We're good. What a battle for first place! Bennett determined to take the top spot, but Walker fighting just as hard to keep it. - Come on, let's go! - Go, go, go, go. Yes, yes, yes, keep it going. Keep it going! Walker tries to make a move in turn two, but he just can't catch Bennett! We've only got two laps to go! Yes, yes, yes, come on! Shit! Oh, my God. Ooh, that's gotta hurt. Oh, and Bennett goes off track. Let's hope he's okay. Damn. Just go. Just go. I got the baby. Stay here, I'll be back. Hold up. Let's get outta here. Hey, asshole. I know what you did, you trailer-trash piece of shit. You either got huge balls, or your eyesight ain't so good, little man. Oh. Come on, Riley, hang on! Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. All right, almost there! You're gonna make it! Gonna make it, gonna make it. Oblique tibial fracture. And that's on the good leg. With these injuries, I'd tell you he shouldn't be racing, but I assume you've already tried that. - Yeah. - These guys are worse than junkies. - How long until... - I know what you're gonna ask. Eight weeks minimum before he sets a foot on a bike again. Twelve weeks would be better. Never again would be best. I'll check up on him tomorrow. Thanks, Doc. He's gonna miss all his qualifiers. Okay, hold on with that. Can I have a minute with him, please? Of course. Babe? Babe. I don't know what I was thinking, baby. What? Don't say that. No, you were right. It's too risky. It's too risky. Stop. Racing is part of you. And I realize that when I said, "I do," it was to all of you. Thank you. For what? For letting me get to say I tried. Scooch. Come on. So, I think I should probably take next semester off - and go back to... - No, baby. Baby, no. No, just... Just for a little bit. So we don't fall so far behind, you know? When I'm better, I'm gonna fix a thousand bikes, and I'm gonna teach a million kids to ride, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you your clinic, baby. I promise you. I love you. I love you so much. Yo, Cyrus! Cyrus! Yo? Bike's good to go. Can I get a hand? Be right there! - You got it? - Looking good. - Looking good. - All right. Lunch is here! - Sophie. - Cyrus. So what do you do at the clinic? Do you ask the animals to turn and cough? No. I give injections, check their teeth, test for diseases, stuff like that. - What about neutering? - Mmm-hmm. We do that. I bet you're pretty good at it. Don't you forget it. What's up, slugger? What do you want, Tony? I'm here to see Bennett. I've got a question for him. Is that all you got? Excuse me? - Get outta here, Tony. - I'm curious. Yeah, bye-bye, jerk-off. Don't get your panties in a twist. - Excuse me? - Turn around and walk out of this store. I just wanna know if he's done. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - It's okay. It's fine. What's your problem? Simple. Do you think you can beat the Walker brothers? - If I wasn't hurt? - Yeah, sure. I'd wipe my ass with both of them. Okay, then... let me show you something. You see this? Hangtown, '97. Some jerk messed with my bike. Cost me my shot. I remember that. And you see this? This is from rearranging his face. Yeah, I remember that, too. There's one thing I don't do, and that's mess with a man's bike. Yeah, but one of your boys did. He sure might have. But he ain't my boy no more. Chris left the team. We had an agreement when I sponsored him that when he turns pro, he takes Panterra Racing factory level with him. Instead, he jumps ship and goes with Irongrip with his dumb brother. Nothing more do I want than to kick both of their asses. But you know what's better? You. I want you to smoke their asses on the track. Are you serious? I'm serious as a heart attack. I can't ride for a while. - How long? - Four to six weeks. - Stable or oblique fracture? - It's a stable. You're good. It's healed already. I'm sorry, are you a doctor? Do you know how many broken bones I've had? If I get my physical therapist to do his voodoo magic on you, you'll be good to go in no time. Make it to the last qualifiers. Loretta Lynn's? No, I can't do that. I can't afford it. - It's in Tennessee. - I'll cover the expenses. Gas, hotel, we'll get you out there. But a couple months later, Lucas Oil Outdoor Pro Motocross. You're gonna have to win. Get us sponsors, keep this thing going. Marshall Bennett wins the Loretta Lynn 450! But what's in it for you? Panterra Racing gets to go pro. Finally. You in? The Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Championship season starts at historic Glen Helen Raceway in glorious Southern California. Yeah, it's one of the most popular tracks due to its endless jumps and elevation changes. You can find a lot of riders training here all year, like number eight, Chris Walker. Today marks his first pro race - with Irongrip Tools. - Okay, all set, Ray-Ray. He is, of course, the younger brother of last year's champion, number 88, Kurt Walker. Yeah, you know, Chris placed in the top three in all of his qualifiers. Talent definitely runs in this family, and I wouldn't be surprised to see both of them on the podium. - No question. - Awesome. Here you go. All right. What are you ladies' names? Victoria and Rebecca. Victoria and Rebecca. - Pretty names, huh? - Yeah, very pretty. Thank you, ladies. Thank you. Hey, Tony. Tony. Wait, hey. Have you thought any more about our discussion? Look, Sophie, no offense, but you don't have a ton of experience. What do you mean? I was running things just fine until you showed up. For half a season. I've been doing this for 20 years. Okay, but I can take some of your workload. I managed at the clinic. I know how to delegate. Well, you can't be the manager. I'm the team manager. I pay for all this shit. You got any other ideas? Public relations. I'm gonna help get us sponsors. And what the hell qualifications do you have to do that? The sponsors are men, and I have boobs. Deal. Hey, hey, quick, quick, look, look, look. Look quick. All right, easy, big guy. That's all the damage they're gonna be doing today. Qualified ninth. He's out of his league. Oh, hey, look who it is. - What's up, buddy? - Hey. Good to see you. Hey, man. Thanks for coming out. - Hey, I wouldn't miss it. - Yeah. And I brought you a cheering section. - Yeah? - They're from my support group. Gearheads through and through. Hey, I'm Justin. It's an honor to meet you, Sarge. - Nice to meet you, man. - I'm Dustin. - Hey, nice to meet you. Hey. - Hi, I'm Brad. - Attention, attention. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. All riders to the start gate. All right, you all stretched out? - Yeah. - All right. Hey, Junior, I got sponsors for today, but sponsorship bonuses, that's the only way we can keep this thing going. Show us what you got. This is one of our biggest turnouts for a season opener. Over 20,000 spectators here today to see which one of these riders will take home the $25,000 purse. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Listen, Bennett, we came here to win this thing, me and my brother, one-two. So you just stay out of our way. Yeah, I watched you during qualifying, Chris. So you know, we got you beat by over four seconds. What I know is you're a carbon copy of your brother. And that's why I'm gonna yard your ass, too. Move. Marshall Bennett, number 32, he's the guy to watch. I thought he was injured. Sir, tracers and IEDs in Afghanistan couldn't keep this man from riding. Just think about giving him your support when he takes the podium, all right? - All right. - Thanks. Oh, sir, excuse me! You know, Bennett is a new addition to Team Panterra. Not sure what his chances are. He took a four-year hiatus from motocross to go serve, and he came back injured. All right, buddy, it's all you. So I'm surprised he's even here. Go do it. Well, and apparently there's lots of bad blood between Team Panterra and that former rider of theirs, Chris Walker. You just get to the front. I'll bury anyone who comes up. All right, with two minutes to go. There's our top qualifier, Justin Muscutt, number 14. He's looking very confident. - Hey. - How'd it go? Uh, great. I talked to eight different sponsors, E3 Spark Plugs seems the most promising. - E3? They're good. - Yeah, I know. Good job. All right, here we go, guys. All right, with 30 seconds to go, this Pro Motocross Championship at Glen Helen is about to kick off. Revs are up and the gate is down! - Go! - Let's go! Ooh! Massive bottleneck coming out of turn one! Multiple wipeouts. That's gonna thin the herd a lot. You know, that first turn always shows you who wants the bigger house. Chris Walker's already making his way to the front of pack. As they round the Yamaha Bridge, 48 and 14 are leading the race! Moving up mid-pack is number 32, Marshall Bennett. Yeah. And number 14 takes the lead as they descend Mt. St. Helen. Oh, Bennett and Foster get into a little tangle as they round the backside bridge. Number eight, Chris Walker's putting down a strong first lap as he comes out of the canyon. His brother, Kurt, is not far behind, getting some massive air. Number 32, Marshall Bennett, is also holding his own as he gets some hang time in the canyon. Number 88, Kurt Walker, passes 79 heading into the back straight. Man, this competition is intense. That's a tight first lap, folks. We got a lot of good riders here today. This could be anybody's race. Come on, baby, go! Oh, look at Chris Walker, just charging past 121. Number 14, Justin Muscutt, continues to lead this race. Eighty-eight, Kurt Walker, is on fire, moving into third place as he laps number 58. I'm telling you, there's gonna be at least one Walker on the podium today. Oh! Forty-eight takes a nasty spill as Bennett closes in on the leader. Coming around for lap nine is race leader, number 14, with the Team Irongrip Walker brothers gaining ground. And right behind them is Marshall Bennett. Yes! Go, baby! Just look at Marshall Bennett. He's found his groove. He's tearing it up. Bennett is now right on the heels of the pack leaders as he comes around turn one! Bennett is clearly looking to pass as they approach the backside bridge. Oh! Bennett goes wide and passes Kurt Walker! What a move by Bennett! I did not see that coming. He is now in third place. Almost got ya. Kurt's looking to take back that number-three spot, chasing down Bennett, looking to make a move. Oh! And Kurt Walker block-passes Bennett, knocking him off his bike. Oh, man. An aggressive play by 88. Bennett scrambles to get back in the race, but he's losing positions every second that goes by. Too bad for Bennett. Bennett's back on his bike, but he's got a lot of distance to make up. Only three laps left, and 14's still leading this race, with Irongrip's Kurt and Chris Walker closing in. Back in eighth place, Bennett's inching his way forward. He hasn't given up yet. Look at this, Chris lets his brother by. Kurt is charging race leader Justin Muscutt. Two laps to go and Kurt Walker is just bearing down on 14. Kurt's reeled him in. He dives in for the pass. Oh, contact! Muscutt's off the track! Yes. Kurt Walker now has the lead with his younger brother just behind. Looks like Team Irongrip has this. Don, check out this battle going on at the backside bridge. Marshall Bennett moves up two more spots. He's back in third place! The white flag is out! It's the final lap. That's how you do it! Oh, look at this, Gordon. Bennett is hot on their heels. The Walkers round the Yamaha Bridge, and 32 is closing in! He is a man on a mission. You got it! Come on, Marshall. I'm back. Thirty-two has made his way back. I can't believe it! I don't think he's gonna settle for third. - Go, go, go. Get 'em! - Come on! Oh. Bennett passes Kurt Walker again. That has got to piss Kurt off. Whoa! Eighty-eight takes a dive! Bennett's now in second place. It's the final stretch! Can he catch Chris Walker? Come on. Checkered flag is out! Come on, baby! He did it! Bennett strokes under Chris Walker! I don't think that's ever been done before! Oh, my God, and Chris almost loses it on the landing! Oh, we're screwed. Whoa! Marshall Bennett is the winner of the Lucas Oil Pro Championship at Glen Helen. That's my boy. Yes! - I knew you could do it! - Yeah! Yeah! This is yours, man. - Are you serious? - Panterra's gone pro. Thanks, buddy. Hey, Marshall, you mind if we do a quick interview? Yeah. So, Marshall, halfway through the race, you went off the track. Did you think you were gonna be able to come back? I had no idea, but I had to try.
