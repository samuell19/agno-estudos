Yes, here I am. Come on. Hello. Yes, follow me. Yes, for the tour. Yes, it's me. Follow me. - Hello. - Hello. This way. Let's go, we're a bit late. Let's get started. The site we are visiting... - Hello. - Hello. The site we are visiting has greatly evolved over the last 30 years. It was built on what used to be the Paris slaughterhouse, closed in 1974. This tour will take us back in time, since our last stop will be the first building to have been completed, the Cité des sciences et de l'industrie, built by Adrien Fainsilber, with its famous Géode, an iconic building which will be our last destination. You may already observe the Grande Halle, turned into a exhibition hall between 1983 and 1985 by architects Reichen and Robert. The park, created in the late 1980s, is where Bernard Tschumi created his Follies. These are 10 m3 cubes plotted at 120 m intervals across the garden. - How many Follies are there? - 26. To your left is the Conservatoire for music and dance. To your right is the Cité de la musique. Let us follow this musical thread and head towards the latest construction to date, completed in 2015, only a few months ago: the Philharmonie. Follow me. Had you ever been to La Villette? Is it your first time? Oh, you've been here before! Ten times, at least. This surprisingly-shaped roof is the Paris Zenith, a concert hall built in 1983, initially meant as a temporary building, but still standing. Across from us, this peculiar building... The Grands Moulins? Absolutely. The Grands Moulins of Pantin. Nowadays, you won't find any flour, but the headquarters of a big bank. The conversion of this building symbolizes the impressive transformation of the inner suburbs. Over the last ten years, Pantin has become the classic example of cities formerly surrounded by brownfields which have now become attractive, and have become the home of new populations of Parisians, families and younger people. Paris is overflowing. I speak from experience, because after finishing my studies, this is where I came to live. You can almost see my window from here. This used to be the main hall of the slaughterhouse. I hope this tour has given you some insight into 30 years of architecture. Since... Since, over the last 30 years... Thank you, we really enjoyed it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Yes, they're contemporary. The Forum des Halles was inaugurated in 1979, but to me, it's not as big a success. It was very interesting. Thank you. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Thank you. I'll come for the Batignolles. I love the neighborhood. All right. You need to leave me alone. I'm saving my skin. I thought we could start again slowly. We could start - something new together in Paris. - I can't. I don't want to. Autumn Here. This is yours. I'm not going back to Toulouse. Don't you want to finish what you started? I wouldn't be the first not to finish school. I can't stay in that apartment. It reminds me of Lea. I'm in Paris. I'm here to stay. Say, your friend who works in the cultural sector, couldn't he find me a job? I can ask him. Something with kids, like a movie workshop. The way he describes it, it looks like fun. - Gaston, come and help me. - Honestly, Mathias! Those workshops don't pay! It's how you learn. It's an introduction to film-making. I don't think so. What matters is that you make your own movie. I think it's great for him to stay in Paris. If you want, you can stay with us. - What do you think, Mathias? - Sure. - Hello! - Hello. I'm sorry. It's so late. No, don't worry. It's what was planned. You can put your things here. To turn it on, press here and release. You have all you need right here. The silverware is in here. The top shelf of the fridge is yours. That's fine. The bathroom and toilets. It's a sliding door. - But what about your things? - They're in my bedroom. You didn't have to do that! Here. It's nice! I'm sorry, I forgot something. Don't worry about it. I have to get up very early tomorrow. - I hope I won't wake you. - Don't worry, it's fine. Your keys are here. - Good night. - Good night. Thanks. - And... sweet dreams. - See you tomorrow. Martin! Hmm... Tristan? That's right. From high school, in Toulouse. Right, right. But we weren't in the same class. I remember you well. You wanted to work in the movies. 15 that why you're here? Among other things. What do you do? Remember, I studied science. A professor in Toulouse told me to come to Paris. He said I could do a PhD, maybe even have a career in research. I was scared at the time. I've been a PhD student for two years now. Do you live here? Not at all. I'm staying with my cousin and his girlfriend. But they have kids and a schedule. I feel like I'm in their way. I'm getting tired of it. I came to see if I could stay in a hotel, rent a room for the month or the year. Why not find an apartment and pay rent? It's what the receptionist told me. I'm not a student, I'm not on welfare, I don't know anyone. When I first came to Paris, I didn't know anyone either. It wasn't easy. - Are you sure you're OK? - I'm fine. I have to be careful not to bang my feet against the furniture. All right. It's ridiculous. You can't sleep like this. Come here. I mean it. - Good night. - Good night. I'm sorry. I never came to your movie club. You remember that? We barely knew each other. How could I forget? You handed out invitations and posted fliers everywhere. You were really insistent. It didn't work for all that. I remember, for The Lady from Shanghai, only three people came. For Morocco, I was alone with my brother. I'd forced him to come. You know, I don't know the first thing about movies. But what was beautiful was... How determined you seemed, like a stubborn artist. You didn't seem to care what others thought. I guess I admired you. Right. Lights off. Oh, I have to tell you. I sleepwalk sometimes. Really? What do I do? Do I wake you? - Not wake you? - No. You can redirect me towards my bed. But I usually find my way. It almost never happens. Good night. Good night. Settle down. You all recognize Jerome. He is here with a colleague. You're in good hands. Hello, everyone. - How are you all doing? - Good. Today, I'm with Martin. He'll be running a programming workshop. I'll let you explain what programming is and introduce yourself. Hello, everyone. My name is Martin. I'm from Toulouse, where I studied at the ESAV, a film school. We are all going to watch a series of movies and then decide on how to establish, or constitute, a program for the movies we saw. - Yes? - Have you ever made a movie? No, if by movie you mean a full-length movie. Not yet. But I directed short movies when I was in school. Let's focus on the idea of programming. - Do you know what programming is? - No. Maybe we should start from there. To program means to select, to choose. It's a commitment. I think what matters is that... Never mind, go ahead. It's a commitment... We're going to watch all these movies and once we've seen them, and talked them over, we'll select and choose them. But what's the objective of this work? - The objective? - What's the point? To make you aware and curious, and to help you know why you like something. Not just saying "I like" or "don't like" something, but analyzing it. Your name is Lucas, right? - Loucas. - Right, sorry. Loucas, let me speak about my own experience. When I was younger, I was lucky enough, or so I believe, to have people show me movies. They helped me hone my critical skills and all these things, but above all, some of these movies showed me a part of myself I didn't know. A part I couldn't express. It was crucial. It was an encounter. It was like meeting your future best friend. That's why I'm here today to discuss movies. I have the hope, as well as Martin and Valérie do, that when you discover these movies, you will experience such an encounter. Maybe you will discover something about yourself, Loucas, that you didn't know of, or couldn't express. Thanks to a movie, you might become able to express it. It's very ambitious, but I believe in it. Paul Verlaine was seven when his father suddenly quit the army, left Metz, and decided to move here, 10 rue Nollet, which was then called rue Saint Louis. Moving to Paris is a first breaking point in little Paul's life, up until then coddled by his parents and grandparents, with whom he spent a lot of time in the Ardennes countryside. Verlaine later wrote of his disappointment upon his arrival in Paris, which he describes as a bleak, ugly, and sad city. The time spent on the second floor of this bourgeois building nevertheless represents decisive years for the poet who would later come back to stay in his childhood neighborhood. He is in fact buried in the Batignolles cemetery. Paul would walk to his school, located some distance away, always accompanied by his mother. Growing up, he developed the habits of a bohemian lifestyle. With his group of friends, he visited the neighborhood cafes. His mother covered up his excesses, hiding them from his father. At 21, Verlaine moved out of the apartment to live slightly farther off, rue Lécluse, with his mother. A year later, he met Rimbaud, the very year his son was born. Shall we continue? How about that! Rue de Bizerte. That's where Gilles Deleuze lived. The philosopher. He mentions it in his Abécédaire. I believe it's at the letter G. "G" for "Gauche." Can we go see? All right. Come on. It's on this street that Jean Eustache lived. And where he died. - Who? - A filmmaker. He made some wonderful movies. He never could make all the movies he had in him. I knew a boy who also loved Eustache's movies. He could recite whole dialogues by heart. What a strange man. He told me he lived on a boat near Bastille. - Is he a bargeman? - Not at all. He's a musician. He also writes contemporary music. Come. It will be beautiful. - Where? - Right there. - Let's take a picture. - What for? To make new memories. Now, hold it in your arms. Yes, very nice. Winter We see how the needle positions itself in the direction of the magnet. It positions itself at a distance. That's something, right there. I don't know if you've ever tried to open a door. No one? You do it every day. Have you ever managed to do so remotely? No. You have to push the door, for it to open. You have to be in contact. But the needle moves without it. This shows two fundamental properties of magnetism. That of object orientation and attraction at a distance. There are quantity of spools here. Using conducive material, you can isolate in your imagination one metal component, and make it revolve. The electrons can revolve here, or there. It's not that surprising. It's what we saw earlier. It's exactly the same thing. We have one spool set on top of another, with a variable magnetic field. The power creates a contrasting magnetic field, and it levitates. All right? And now, what if... I add this? It's beautiful, huh? Like a picnic table. So you won't have the same color. The second thing... Excuse me, the second thing... is that the light intensity will be so strong that the retina will be saturated and you'll just see a white flash. - All right, then. Thank you. - Goodbye. - I have to tell you something. - Yes? I feel uncomfortable sleeping with you without telling you. Sometimes, I do sexual things with men. It's been like this for a while. Sexual things? What do you mean? Well, sex. Don't worry, I'm not saying that so you and I will make love. I'm not worried. If I said no, you wouldn't force me, would you? No. But I don't want you to feel uncomfortable because you think I want something to happen. If you did, you wouldn't say it like this. - Do you want to? - No. Not with you. I don't know why. What about your girlfriend, Lea? Lea. I loved her. It was good. It was normal. I thought we'd have a child someday. I loved going on vacation with her. Have you been in a hotel with a girl? The receptionist greets you. She knows you're going to make love in a room. She's all smiles. She's not suspicious. I never did it. I never made love. Did you take a vow of chastity? Monks did it to devote their energy to important matters. I think it was to stay pure. But no. It's not a vow. It's just how it is. Tristan? Yeah? If something happened to you, something serious, anything, or if the world disappeared, you could die a virgin. And pure. Ever think of that? Stop, you're scaring me. Sorry, I didn't mean to. It's just beautiful. To die a virgin. - Hey, Lea. - Hi. - Welcome. - Thank you. - May I? - Please. It's small in here. It's nice. - You like it? - Yes. I was afraid a boat in Paris would look nouveau riche. - You're an artist? - If you like. In my everyday life, it just means being organized. I used to read it a lot. I don't know why, now I can't finish a book. I'm sorry. You're scared. I'm scared too. Take my hand. I can't. What's wrong? Why are you dressed like that? Where were you? At Orly. Or Edinburgh, if you prefer. Flight 1943. - You're a flight attendant? - Of course. You look nice. There's a gape there. I can help with that. I'll sew it back. Oh, thanks! How do you become a flight attendant? You have to be good at foreign languages, have some experience as a ground hostess, do three months of security training before a company hires you, and then, welcome on board! Don't cry. You've been here for months and I never asked what you did. Flight attendant. That's incredible. What an adventure. An adventure... it soon becomes routine. Flight attendants lead very common lives. Is it normal, to fall in love with an older man? An older man? Not old, but someone who is twice my age. People always say the beginnings are nice, but it's not true. It hurts. Hello? Grandma, it's me. I'm fine. Is the radio on? It's Ravel. Mother Goose. Of course, I thought of us. Come, let's listen to it together. Can I come, Grandma? Yes, to your place. I don't know. For sometime. Spring It's always nice to discover a new city, even briefly. It's weird though. You see the station, the hotel, the restaurant, the theater. And then you leave. It's like being a sales rep. It's all the little things. A guy comes to pick you up, you have to chat in the car. You're introduced to someone, you listen to stories about city hall. - Did people come? - You never know if people will come. This time was OK. I mentioned Renoir, realism. People were receptive, I joked around. And then this woman asked me who my favorite director was. I hate that. But I didn't want to upset her. She was nice. 50 I made an effort. And then it came to me: Boris Barnet. Barnet. Of course. Martin? - Jerome. - What a coincidence. - What's up? It's crowded here. - You got a ticket. I made a reservation. Have you met Theo? He's a movie critic. This is Martin, a future filmmaker. He's running a workshop in Ivry this year. Have you seen the movie? Not in the theater. Only on YouTube. They showed it on Arte when Bernadette Lafont died. I've seen it. First for a re-release. I was a student in Strasbourg. Then there was a retrospective at Beaubourg. It's nice to see a movie every ten years. You reassess things. I don't know about today. We'll see. I have some misgivings. Is that Francoise Lebrun? You know her so well you can blow each other kisses? Why not? She owns a family house in my village. She's involved in my association. We host readings. - Your village? You don't live in Paris? - No, why? I've had my share. Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming to our screening of La Maman et la putain. It's a rare film, which explains why there are so many of you. Exceptionally, it will be introduced by Françoise Lebrun, who plays Veronika. Give her a warm round of applause. And by Pierre Lhomme, director of photography on the film. The floor is yours. Is the mic on? Yes. It's very touching to see a full room. I'm sorry, I'm so moved. I keep thinking of Eustache, who would be so happy to see us here. Forgive me. Who has already seen the movie? Wow! Speaking of La Maman et la putain is somewhat overwhelming, because it is the most serious film I ever took part in. Serious because of the seriousness Eustache carried with him all his life and which we felt every day. Cinema was for him a vital element, it was vital for him to make movies, to print something on film. We even found candy! - Where is Martin? - Moving furniture around in the bedroom. I don't know. I didn't get it. He didn't like it. He wanted to push the desk by the window to work better. - Is that them? - I think so. Hello. - Hello. - Thank you. Wildflowers, for you. - Thank you. - I know how you like them. How kind. Please, come in. - Do you know Bastien? - No. I'm sorry, hello. He's my next-door neighbor. He loves yard sales. He found us a car for the return trip. - We can pack as much as we like. - Nice to meet you. - Elise. - Hello. Mathias. The children are playing in the den. That's Tristan. - Hello. - Martin is upstairs. He should be down any moment. He's Mathias's cousin. A producer agreed to read his script. He wants to finish it this weekend. Good Lord! He likes the idea of writing in the country. It's his romantic side. - Jerome! - Here he comes. Your lamp doesn't work. So, you're Martin. Jerome, why didn't you tell me? What do I look like now? - What is it? - Bouchées à la reine. Did you know this dish was invented out of love? When Louis XV deserted her, the Queen and her cooks decided to create a dish made of ingredients thought to be aphrodisiacs, such as sweetbreads and lamb brains, to regain the King's love. - It didn't work. - How do you know all of this? I have my bible. It describes the history of traditional French dishes. Their adaptations, - their evolutions. It's fascinating. - Why, Jerome! It's a classic. Everyone has it. - Really? - Yes. I didn't know. Hand it over. The bouchées... The original classic garnish of these vol-aux-vents, is a purée of fowl with cream. It has become common to replace it with a salpicon of fowl breast meat, and a garnish of truffles and mushrooms bound with a Parisian sauce. It is the garnish most commonly used. It's wonderful, Francoise. Very poetical. You should read it at the poetry festival. Not Paul Valery. Nonsense. Valéry is beautiful. Yes, but it's predictable. Gastronomy and literature is more modern. It'd be a hit. Yes, I guess it's fashionable. Whatever you choose, hurry. We're printing the programs next week. Come on, Françoise. We all want to hear you read it. We are two urchins I always play this song after a dinner with friends. Two jolly rascals Who love a laugh and a fight Who eat like horses And drink like fish When the gallons we swig Against the windows we swing Of the estaminet The hideous bourgeois Trembles in his uniform Under his fat cap Life is diverse As we brave the rain That makes our skins wet "As we brave the rain..." "Always carousing "With hardly any boots "And no hat at all" I'm going to bed. Yes. Good night. Our love and our youth Good night. - Good night. - Good night. See you tomorrow. With our formidable fists We are devils The weather forecast doesn't look good for our walk tomorrow. We're not there yet. Your passion for organization has made you into a spoilsport. You can't do anything if it's not planned. And not doing anything makes me panic. Shit. Martin, what's wrong? Tristan is a Sleepwalker. I think he's having a fit. We should make sure nothing happens to him. - Where is he going? - Let's follow him and see. - I love it. Let's go. - Watch your step, Françoise. - It's full of mole holes. - Hush. Don't wake him. - What are you doing here? - You weren't sleepwalking? Not at all. You're all nuts! - Can't one go for a walk? - Great. What's the topic of your talk? Electrostatics? Magnetism. Electromagnetism. I'll come to the Palais de la découverte. I've never been. It's a good opportunity. Don't worry, Jerome. The weather will be fine tomorrow. I'll go to the yard sale nearby. I need a couch. What about the four flights of stairs in Paris? Martin. You like to move furniture around. Would you come and help Bastien? Why not? There you are. - Hello, Françoise. - Hello, Bastien. It looks heavy. - Hello, Françoise. - How are you? Come in. Can you make it? Careful, now. Your clothes match your couch. Set it over there. I'll manage the rest. All right. Perfect. Thank you. Well, then. Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye, Bastien, see you soon. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. She could at least have offered us something to drink. Let's go in the bedroom. Why don't you talk? Hello. - Hello, musician man. - Hello. Have you been here long? - Didn't you mention a requiem last time? - I'm working on one. It's the third rehearsal. It's going very well. I'm delighted. I was afraid a requiem might be too sad or dark. But it isn't. The choir is open to all. It attracts people of all ages, old and young. Some 50 people come to sing. - I'm very happy with it. - How can so many people sing at once? Most of them can't read music. I have to work outside traditional scoring. There's no score? No. I draw from medieval writing. I start from monody, with a cantor and responses. I try to create an organum. Parallel voices, a harmonization in parallel voices. Then a contrasting movement, in descant. It's an homage to transvestites. I have a surprising source, Pedro Lemebel, - a Chilean transvestite and prostitute. - Jicé! Lea! It's Lea. Where were you? You disappeared. - Hello, Grandma. - Hello, darling. - How are you? - Good. - And you? - Good, as always. - Hello. - Thanks for bringing him. Give me a kiss. That's annual honesty. It has transparent oval seedpods. They're lovely. They're beautiful. He didn't prune the dead branches. What a shame. Never mind. Let me show you something. Over there. The Belvedere. - Ravel's house. - Yes. Ravel's house. She never forced me to do anything. She did her things in her workshop. She organized visits of Ravel's house several times a week. I needed this shelter. After Martin. And then you burst into the scenery. Were you very much in love with this boy? Yes. Too much. If that means anything. I wasn't with myself anymore. I don't want that. I'd best tell you now. The producer I know told me he read your scenario and couldn't help. He's not interested. I'm sorry. Did he tell you why? Yes, he told me. You mean it's not pleasant to hear? I read it too. I don't mean to coach you, but I think you should try to do it. You'd need allies. You'd find them. The main thing, is to give yourself fully. - I'm not so sure. - I am. I recognized something, reading it. It had to do with childhood. With the invisible middle-class. With banality. You may have to take out some romanticism. Although... Did you ever want to make a movie? - I made one, some time ago. - Can I see it? There's a 16 mm copy. But I don't want to show it. Nor see it again. Maybe I should. For a long time, I believed it was a total failure. It might not be that bad. I found it much too difficult. Too painful. I really don't think it's my thing. But it's all right. There's no obligation to make movies. I rather help others accomplish themselves. For me, being motivated every morning just doesn't come naturally. Let's do what we planned: go see a movie. I don't know. I don't think I feel up to it. Take your mind off things. What will you do? I don't know. We'll see. As you like. I have to go. - Bye. And thanks. - You're welcome. Summer - You came. - Did you think I wouldn't? Do you have a couple of minutes, to talk? Yes. I'm here. I'm listening. I don't know how to say it. I wanted to see you. It surprised me. What surprised you? I'm not very used to this kind of relationships with boys. To sit in a cafe and talk. To have another connection than sex. Have you ever been in love? I never thought I could fall in love with a boy. Love was with girls. I was two years with a girl. Now, I don't know what to do with it. That relationship really meant something to you, didn't it? So it existed. Take me someplace. If you like. Love, love, when you catch hold of us Love, love, how tight you hold us Your body dose against mine Let's dance! Castanets and tango, olé! Here the breeze smells sweet With the scent of orange trees With the joy of living and singing Love, castanets, and tango, olé! Please get ready to dance the Madison! Get on the dance floor and get in line for the Madison. Let's go. Music! Have you seen a bare-naked man Walking out the bathroom door Already bad and sort of paunchy His mustache all sad and floppy Have you seen a very ugly man Eating a plate of spaghetti Fork in his hand, looking dopey Tomato sauce on his jersey When they're handsome, they're morons When they're old, they're cold When they're tall, they're superficial When they're lean, they're very mean Don't get married, girls Don't get married Go into the movies Stay all your life with your daddies Raise dogs and sheep Go work the streets But don't get married, girls Don't get married Have you seen an embarrassed fellow Come home well past suppertime Lipstick on his collar Almost tripping over Have you ever seen at the cabaret Some staggering old drunkard Leaning insistently over Some innocent young flower I have a message. Hello, Martin. It's Lea. It's been a while. I was thinking of you. I wanted to see you. If you agree, I think I'd like that. That's all. I'm singing in a choir next Saturday. It's at 3 p.m. at the Aquarium theater. There'll be a seat for you. I hope you're well. We are The little boys We are The little boys Outrageously made up It's so beautiful to see you all singing together. It's strange, and also sort of sad. But thanks to the story and the costumes, I loved it. I didn't think the music would be sort of... Thanks. Sort of what? Sort of... joyful. Then sad. And powerful. - And dythirambic. - Martin? Are you leaving? Yes. I thought you'd be busy. That you had people to see. Things to do. I wanted to write you something. I wasn't sure you'd come. Do you... I didn't know if you were still in Paris. Or if you'd left, or if you'd left and come back. It's nice to see you. Really. I'm Martin. Were you singing too? No, I don't sing. Only when I'm on my own. But I love music. This is Alicia. We're sharing the apartment now. You're mostly on your barge! Yes. It's Jicé's barge. You moved to Paris then, definitely? Are you free one of these days? Come then, July 14. We'll see the fireworks from the boat. It's not far, at Nogent. Nogent-sur-Marne. The guinguettes. The barges. The firemen's ball. Sounds like a picture postcard. Sure, absolutely. You can even bring someone. We don't know who will come, but it'll be full of joy. What was it again? We are The little boys Outrageously made up See you. See you soon.
