Five, four, three, two, one. Fire! Coming! No, don't open the door. As if I would! It's your last night before you ship out. Rongelap needs help. The people are still suffering. The effects of the fallout are getting worse, not better. And the fucking French haven't learnt the lesson, either. Neither have you! How long this time? How long before you tuck in your kids again? Joanne, please. When's it going to be enough? Who exactly are you saving the world for? Certainly not your family? I want our kids left with a world to grow up in. And I want them to have a father! They have a father! I want to be a father. And a husband. That's up to you, not me. It's up to us. Fine. Okay. Stay tonight. The kids'd like it if you were here in the morning. If we were just fucking trying. General Saulnier. What is this, Minister Hernu? We're now planning operations against a bunch of hippies? Lacoste prefers to call them "environmental terrorists." Lacoste is an idiot. He would've blown them out of the water years ago. And why not? Their actions are illegal. And now they plan to disrupt our testing programme? It has to be stopped. The protest or our tests? This Greenpeace, your bunch of hippies, has annoyed the Canadians, the British, the Spanish... I doubt we'll encounter opposition if we force them to abandon their ridiculous plans. Lacoste is on to it. DGSE? For God's sake. Have you forgotten Beirut? The Iranian Embassy? Admiral Lacoste has had two years to tidy up. This was a simple courtesy, to keep you informed. We already have an operative on the ground. I don't want you to go. I know you don't, but I have to. We'll miss your birthday! You can still have a cake. More for you and Paul! Okay? Remember when you asked me why we were here, in Mummy's country, when I'm from Portugal? And I told you I left because I didn't want to fight in a war. In Angaler. Yes. Angola. Yes. Now, there's another war, and this time, I do want to fight. Because it's important. I know you miss me. And I miss you, too. But it's for you, darling, and for Paul. It's a job I have to do. Okay? Will you have a gun? This is my gun. But the test centre is in French Sovereign Territory! If they set foot in it, Admiral Frage's security can arrest them immediately... But that's my point, Lacoste. These people are accomplished propagandists. If we arrest them and they manage to get pictures out, it'll be a PR disaster. So we stop it before it starts! It's time to send these troublemakers a definitive message. I agree. The Rainbow Warrior is on its way to the Marshall Islands and will be in Auckland by July. And you want to be ready before then? You're crazy. It takes months to organise a mission like this! Mitterrand has given his approval. But he wishes to be kept at arm's length from intelligence matters, so you, Saulnier, will sign the orders. "Operation Satanic"? Promise to come back from the war. I promise. If you promise to look after Mummy and Paul for me. I promise. Happy birthday, Papa! Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three... Satanic One. I'm out of play. Zero contact. Three weeks. Our recon operative is safely away. Excellent. I thought it best not to put anything in writing. So, the attack team leader will be on the ground tomorrow. We hold back the others, the divers, for operational reasons. Also tomorrow, our man arrives in New Caledonia to source the yacht and prepare to receive the... necessary equipment. And the equipment is sourced where? London. At the end of the month. It becomes part of a military shipment to New Caledonia. Completely untraceable. Good. But what are the "operational reasons" for delaying the rest of the attack team? Simply a question of timing. We have to allow time for their team leader to get to know the target location. Very good. It seems to be coming together. Yes, the target is travelling. Plenty of time. Time for the yacht team to load the gear, get to New Zealand and establish a good cover story before passing the equipment to the liaison team. And they arrive when? In one month. I don't want them there too soon. Besides... ...the yacht will need time. Doctor, this crook wants 110,000 francs deposit. I'll have it transferred. I'm looking forward to this holiday. Yeah. Us too. Welcome to New Zealand. Good timing. She just tied up at the wharf. Hello, it's Joanne. Babe. It's me. We just made it to Auckland. I was waiting 'til your morning. Are the kids still there? No. Paul's with Grandma. And I just put Marelle on the bus for summer camp. Shit. Camp. I forgot. It's okay. You must be exhausted. How was the Rongelap thing? Exhausting. Some amazing pictures, though. I'll mail you the copies. The kids would like that. Me, too. I'll call on the 11th, early, from here. Can I get Marelle at her camp, then? Is that okay? Sure. I'll have the number for you. It's good, right? We're trying. We are, babe. We are. I feel good about it. We're lucky, you know. With our kids. Very lucky. I know. And I do love you. Fernando? Hello? You're late. Is everything on schedule? Apart from this damn phone call, yes. We get your packages tomorrow morning. Good. Getting them to us will be as arranged? Auckland tomorrow night. Time and place as per plan. Be on time! Fuck off, eh? Give my regards to our friends. There! It's them. No, it's not them. Let's go. I thought they said a camper van... "Just" one dead? No, Lacoste, it's not a blessing. It's another unmitigated disaster! Where are the operatives now? Well, as soon as you know, I want to know! There! Shit! Perhaps they couldn't land by the bridge. No, they couldn't! I already told the boss we needed more time for proper reconnaissance! Hey, here! Come back! Behind! Turn around. Come on, damn it! Come on, come on! Hey, the boat! Forget the damn thing! Get in! Marelle. Uncle Aarne! Your mother needs you. Mummy? Why's Uncle Aarne here? Sweetheart... I'm sorry. It's... Mummy? Why are we waiting for a stupid $130 refund? We need to go. And fast! The girls said it's a problem with the paperwork. It'll look suspicious if... Mitterrand will visit our interests in the Pacific, as planned. If we cancel, it'll be seen as a tacit admission of guilt. Oh! We've already denied involvement. Your point being, General? My point being, our own press is already on the scent. We have two of your agents in custody in New Zealand, and others still out there, so perhaps it might be better to come clean. Put our heads on the block? Because of an unfortunate accident? A man is dead. You want to turn him into a martyr? He already is, isn't he? Isn't that the definition of martyrdom? Dying for a cause you believe in? So, we bury everything here then put in for customs clearance at this, Whangarei. They check us, we're clean. Then we hire a van and come back up for the gear. There's nobody around for miles, so... Not quite bloody right, I'm afraid. Shit. Except for the bed? For more room perhaps? Careful. Good evening, ladies. Another drink? How was I to know someone would steal the fucking dinghy? It's not stolen, you idiot. The police are stalling you. "Looking for a culprit"? Rubbish! Someone's onto us. You saw the news. This is murder now and we're accessories. I can't believe Paris didn't warn us! It's all turned to shit! So you cut and run? Yes! Yes! I was just a front for this operation. It's done. I can leave when I like! Scared of submarines, are you? I wouldn't count on a sub coming for you. Either way, I suggest you get off this damn island fast. And get rid of that boat! "Warriors"? "Warriors"... Who do they think they are, this Greenpeace? Warriors are returned home with honours. Where are they now? I told them not to come. I don't want a fuss. The press, all that. So, here you are, Joanne, having to sign for your husband's body, like a piece of freight. It's all a damn waste. Please. Don't say that. Don't ever say that! If it was a waste, how will I forgive him? If it was a waste, how will the children deal with it? Now. Can I please have my husband! I don't understand you. I don't speak English. We know you did this. Still nothing? We're on our own. Shit. ...just a crappy fold-out map. So, of course we got lost a bit! Here. Take this one! Perhaps next time, you won't be late. There won't be a next time. We're done. It's over, Charles. Both our government and the New Zealand government are pressing for justice and compensation over the death of Dutch national, Fernando Pereira, a photographer working with Greenpeace who was killed... Mummy... ...when the Rainbow Warrior was attacked by French commandos and sunk in Auckland Harbour... I've been dreaming again. I know, darling. I know.
