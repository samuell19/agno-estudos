[SEAGULLS CAWING] [WATER SPLASHES] Nice going, Charlie Brown. I took that rock 4,000 years to get to shore, and now you've thrown it back. Everything I do makes me feel guilty. [BOTH LAUGHING] You know, kid. You and I make a great pair. It‘s nice to lie in the sun and just do nothing. Of course, it's better if you're with someone you like. You kind of like me, don‘t you, Snoopy? Why don‘t we meet here again tomorrow? If you‘ll come, I'll bring a picnic lunch. We'll have sandwiches, cookies and lemonade and potato chips and everything, okay? And we‘ll build another sand castle. Only this time, we'll build an even bigger one. We'll have a great time. Will you come? Good. I'll see you tomorrow. [DICE RATTLING] I wonder where Snoopy is. I've got Boardwalk and Park Place. I'm going to destroy you economically, Charlie Brown. I'll never give up. I have a philosophy that tells me, no matter how bad things get, they will always turn out good in the end. That's not a philosophy, that's stupidity. CHARLIE: Seven. Go directly to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Good grief. When you get out of jail, Charlie Brown, you‘re gonna land on my Boardwalk or Park Place, and then you'll be destroyed. Ha! Twelve, doubles. That means I get another turn. Oh, no, not on Pacific! With hotels! Pay me $1,275, please. Schroeder. Schroeder. How about a beep on the nose? - A what? - Beep. A beep on the nose is a sign of great affection. I'd rather have the $1,275, please. - Pay up. - But I haven't got $1,275. If you can't pay up, then I guess you're bankrupt. LUCY: I am not bankrupt. - It's almost dark. Snoopy isn‘t home yet. I wonder where that dog is. There he is. I wonder where he‘s been all day. What an independent dog. He comes and goes as he pleases. But I have to stay home and fix his supper. Ow! Ow! Ow. Rats! All right, it's supper time. Come and get your supper. Do you see this finger? I cut it opening a stupid can of dog food for your stupid supper. I hope you appreciate it. Besides that, it wasn't a finger, it was my thumb. You've been acting awfully independent lately. Don't forget that I'm the one who feeds you. I'm the one who takes care of you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Without me, you'd be nothing. Everything you have, you have because of me. Even that collar around your neck. Why, I remember the day I went out and bought that collar with money I had worked for and had saved and... I hate it when he does that. [SEAGULLS CAWING] [WHISTLING] [SIREN WAILING AND WHISTLE BLOWING] [GIBBERING] I think I've been stood up. [GIBBERING] [SIGHS] [GIBBERING] [THUDDING] Maybe I came on too strong for him. I know why you want me to go to the library! You‘re trying to trick me into learning how to read. That's what you're trying to do. Who cares about reading? The next thing you know, you‘ll want me to conjugate all those verbs and split those infinitives. I hate reading. I just want to be a good housewife. Shh! You have to be real quiet in here. Now, come on. [GROANS] [GIGGLES] [LAUGHING] [GIBBERING] [SHRIEKS] [GROANING] [YELLING] [SCREAMING] LINUS: Oh, Snoopy. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] [YELLS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [SHRIEKS] Hmm, a letter for Snoopy. I never get letters. Nobody ever writes to me. I had 14 pen pals once, but I did all the writing. Here, Snoopy. You got a letter. [YAWNS] [SNAPPING] [FINGERS SNAPPING] [THUDDING] What's going on? Why are you packed? Are you going someplace? What's going on? Where is he going? I never know what's going on. [GRUNTS] [THUNDER CLAPPING] He's gone. [SCHROEDER PLAYING PIANO] I don't understand it. Who is Lila? You say he got this letter and then he just took off? Well, what does the letter say, Charlie Brown? "Dear Snoopy, I have been in the hospital for three weeks, and I am very lonely. Could you come to see me? Love, Lila." Lila? Who in the world is Lila? If I don't find out who Lila is, I'll go crazy. [CAR VROOMS] [GIBBERING] I don't understand it. Why would Snoopy go to Lila? Maybe Snoopy felt he needed a vacation. Maybe his life with you was getting too boring. Boring? What was I supposed to do? - Keep him entertained? - I don't know. What do other dog owners do? I never thought of myself as being a dog owner. Snoopy was more like a friend. Friends get bored too, Charlie Brown. [SIGHS] - Hey, Ma, I've found a stray dog. SNOOPY: Aah! Ma, oh, Ma. [GULPS] [GRUNTING] Oh, boy, I found a lost bird. Hey, Ma, I found a lost bird! Ma! I got a bird, Ma. To add to my collection, Ma. A dog and a bird. [SIGHS] This is great. I have two pets. Hey, Ma, I got two pets! A Sheepdog and a parrot. Hey, Ma. Can I keep them, Ma? [SIGHS] Hi, puppy. Mom says I can keep you. Boy, I always wanted a dog. I think I‘ll give you a good dog name. Rex? Hey, how about Rex? [GROANS] Here, Rex! Here, Rex! Here! [MAKES KISSING NOISES] [SINGING] I’m a sentimental gal I need a fundamental pal I’ll depend on you You’ll depend on me Speaking psychologically We’ll both have fundamental Friend dependability Fundamental friend dependability I’ll have fun with you You’ll have fun with me That’s fundamental Friend dependability Here, Rex. Here, Rex. Here. - Heel, Rex. Heel. SNOOPY: Aah! Heel, Rex. Heel. [SNOOPY GRUNTING] First thing to do with you, Rex, is to bathe you. I hope you like baths because my doggy has to be real clean. Okay, Rex? Okay, in you go, Rex. Speaking hygienically We’ve got to wash away each ﬂea Rub a-dub a-dub I’II scrub you in the tub Oh, how squeaky clean you’ll be Because of fundamental Friend dependability I will disinfect your whole anatomy When you’ve got a chum Who scrubs you till you’re numb That’s fundamental Friend dependability Down, Rex!

Mom says, if I'm gonna keep you, I gotta take you to the vet for a checkup. You probably need about a dozen shots. [GRUNTING] I'II walk you to the vet's, that will be great, hey, Rex? Heel, Rex, heel. I'm so glad I found you. Mom always said we needed a dog to get rid of our table scraps. [DOGS BARKING] [BOTH GIGGLE] Here, Rex. Here, Rex. Here. [PANTING] [DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES] Rex! You naughty dog, Rex! [PANTING] [SNOOPY SHRIEKS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I'm depressed, Linus. I need an encouraging word to cheer me up. Happiness lies in our destiny, like a cloud in the sky before the storms of tomorrow destroy the dreams of yesterday and last week. I think that blanket is doing something to you. [THUDDING] [SIGHS] [WHISTLING] [BOTH LAUGHING] [YAWNS] [GIBBERING] [CRANKING] [CLOCK TICKING] [ALARM RINGS] [LAUGHING] There's only one thing to be done, Charlie Brown. I think you should disown that ungrateful dog. Disown him? You have to face it, Charlie Brown, nobody made him leave, he went because he wanted to. You'll just have to get another dog. I don‘t want another dog. And I still say, if I don‘t find out who Lila is, I'll go crazy! He's hopeless. Listen to that music, Chuck, it's a carnival. Doesn't that do something to you? Listen. It's a beautiful evening, Chuck. The air is warm. The sky is filled with stars. And I've got a whole pocketful of tickets for the carnival. Come on, let's go. Listen, people are laughing, Chuck. They're having a good time. You can‘t let yourself get into a mood like this. I know you miss Snoopy. I miss him too. But if you let yourself get into a mood, no one will want to be around you. No one likes a moody person, Chuck. Take it from me. I learned a long time ago that if you go around in a mood feeling sorry for yourself, you do it alone. And I mean alone, Chuck. [GRUNTS] I don‘t know. I've seen people get sick on merry-go-rounds and Ferris wheels and roller coasters, but you‘re the first person I've ever seen who got sick going through the turnstile. Hey, look at that, Chuck. Come on, let's go! [CHARLIE GRUNTING] We‘re having a good time, aren't we, Chuck? I love this kind of life. I like action. I'm a moving-type person. When nothing is moving, I feel low. That's why I always keep moving. Does your kind ever think about love, Chuck? - What do you mean, my kind? - I'm sorry. I didn‘t mean to put it that way. No offense. I apologize. Friends? You touched my hand, Chuck. Hey, look here, a fortune-telling machine. Let‘s get our fortune told, Chuck. Maybe we can find out something about ourselves. PEPPERMINT PATTY [READING]: CHARLIE [READING]: You kind of like being with me, don't you, Chuck? What do you think love is, Chuck? Well, years ago, my dad owned a black 1934 two-door sedan. - What's that got to do with love? - Well, this is what he told me. There was this real cute girl, see? She used to go for rides with him in his car, and whenever he'd call for her, he would always hold open the car door for her. After she got in and he had closed the door, he'd walk around the back of the car, to the driver's side. But before he could get there, she would reach over and press the button, locking him out. Then, she'd just sit there and wrinkle her nose and grin at him. That's what I think love is. Sometimes I wonder about you, Chuck. [BELL RINGING] [HICCUPS] [GIBBERING] [GIBBERING] [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] [YAWNS] [SIRENS WAILING] [GROANS] [BUTTON BUZZES] [BUTTON BUZZES] Snoopy! I knew you'd come. [SIGHS] Hi, Chuck. Any news from old Snoop? No. No news. He's never been gone this long before. You've got to agree, he's gone because of me. Maybe I came on too strong for him. Right after our fight, he kissed me and I fainted. I think, he thinks, I think there's something wrong with him. He wanted my blanket, I wouldn‘t let go. He left because I was hostile and unkind to him. I made him feel unwanted, like he was a pest. Now I'm going out of my mind for him. - Do you think pets are important? - Sure. A friend of mine at school got some goldfish for his birthday. - I don't think he really wanted them. -Hmm. How did you happen to get Snoopy, Charlie Brown? Well, I'm not quite sure because I was kind of young. I think it started because of something that happened at a playground. I was playing in the sandbox with a couple of other kids. I can‘t even remember who they were. Anyway, all of a sudden, one of them poured a whole bucket of sand over my head. I started crying... I guess. And my mother came running up and took me home. It's kind of embarrassing now to talk about it. Anyway, the next day we drove out to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, and my mother and dad bought me a dog. People buy pets for strange reasons. [SIGHS] I just don't know what to do, Linus. If I don't find out what happened to Snoopy, I think I'll go out of my mind. If you‘ll calm down for a minute, Charlie Brown, I may be able to conduct a little private investigation. Just what I need, a blanket-carrying Sherlock Holmes. I wonder if it would help to call the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. They might know something about him that we don‘t know. I don't understand it. Every morning I brought him a toasted English muffin with grape jelly on it. Sometimes at noon, I'd even fix him a nice salad. He wrote all those letters to the editor. Why doesn't he write me a letter? Snoopy, come home! I'm feeling so much better now that you‘re here. I hope I can go home soon. [DOOR OPENS] Thank you, nurse. Thank you. [DOOR CLOSES AND SNOOPY SIGHS] I'm feeling better every day. Perhaps soon, we can go home. [SNOOPY GULPS] I know that when my mother sees how you‘ve made me well, she'll let me take you home with me. I'll keep you with me forever. What's the matter, Snoopy? You do want to go home with me, don't you? [SOBBING] You poor dear. You're homesick, aren't you? But we'll be good for each other. Hello? Hello, Humane Society? I'm calling about this lost dog, you see. Describe him? I don't know how to describe him. He's just a stupid beagle! I've had it! Let old wishy-washy Charlie Brown find his dog himself. Hello, Daisy Hill Puppy Farm? I'm calling in regard to a dog named Snoopy. Uh-huh. That's right. Charlie Brown. Uh-huh. Oh. Really? Wow. I'll bet he never knew that. That explains a lot of things. [PANTING] Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown! I have news about Snoopy. All right, tell me, what happened? If you don‘t tell me what happened to Snoopy, I'll go crazy. The first thing I did in my investigation was to call the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. I found out something that will amaze you. In fact, I hesitate to tell you. Are you ready for a shock? He wasn't ready for a shock. How can I tell you something that will shock you if you pass out before I can tell you? I'm sorry. I've been hyperventilating a lot lately. Well, anyway. Here's what I found out when I called the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. You are not Snoopy's original owner. Oh, good grief. You bought Snoopy in the month of October, right? According to the records at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, Snoopy was bought by another family in August. This family had a little girl named Lila. Snoopy and Lila loved each other very much, but they had to move and the family decided they just couldn't keep Snoopy. So they returned him. You got a used dog, Charlie Brown. - So that's why Snoopy left. - Sure. He had tried to forget her all these years. But when he found out she was in the hospital, he ran off to see her. I‘ll bet he wishes he was still her dog instead of mine. - That's funny. WOODSTOCK: Hee-hee. Well, Snoopy, this is our last day together. What are we going to do? You're coming to visit me saved me. Are you sure you don‘t want to come home with me? It's up to you, Snoopy. You can go to your other owner if you want to, but I wish you'd come home with me. [SOBS] Snoopy. Oh, I'm so glad you came back. This means you want to come and live with me, doesn't it? Why don't you go back home. Maybe you could settle your affairs. You could say goodbye to all of your old friends, then you could come and meet me at my house. Now, promise me you'll hurry back. After this, you'll never leave again. Promise me. Hurry back, honey. [TYPEWRITER CLICKING] Hey, you‘re back. I heard about Lila. Did you see her? Was she well? Where did you stay all the time you were gone? Was Lila nice to you? Why didn't you write? Are you hungry? Are you well? Can I do anything for you? I'm not getting any answers. I can't stand it! What's this? "I, Snoopy, being of sound mind, do bequeath to Charlie Brown, my previous owner--" Previous owner? "--my best wishes for the future. My treasured belongings will be given to my friends as follows." What's going on here? Why do you mean by all this? "My croquet set I leave to Linus, as well as the chess set. My record collection I place in the capable hands of Schroeder. Carpeting and rest of the furnishings to my favorite charity, the American Humane Association. Thus, with the settling of my affair, I return to Lila who needs me." [PLAYING JAUNTY TUN E] We are gathered together at this farewell party to pay tribute and say goodbye to a very close friend. Perhaps I could persuade some of you to say a few words. Lucy? With a heavy heart I stand before you as we all gather to say our last goodbyes to Snoopy. He leaves us in the prime of his life. [SOBBING] He wasn't much of a dog, but who is? We shall miss our furry friend. So at this time I want to offer this gesture of friendship. A little gift for old times' sake. [SOBS] Farewell, Snoopy. Next, I would like to call on Schroeder. Well, first I would like to thank Snoopy for the record albums. And for the many great times we have had together. [SOBBING] Here, Snoopy, a little token of my friendship. And now a word from Snoopy's ex-owner, Charlie Brown. [GULPS] [WAILING] [WAILS] Snoopy, with a heavy heart and all the best wishes... ...this present. Goodbye, Snoopy. I'm sorry to see you go, Snoopy. I'm sorry we never caught any rabbits. [SOBS] [COUGHING] [SOBBING] [SMOOCHING] Beep. [PLAYING JAUNTY TUN E] [ALL SOBBING] [GIBBERING] [SIGHS] CHARLIE: Why can’t we get all the people together in the world… that we really like, and then just stay together forever? Someone would leave. Someone always leaves. And then we’d have to say goodbye. I hate goodbyes. [SIGHS] You know what I need? I need more hellos. [DOORBELL BUZZES] Snoopy, you finally got here. We‘ve been expecting you. Our whole family is eager to see you again. And I can hardly wait to have you meet my cat. You'll just love each other. He's the sweetest thing. I must be cracking up. I can't sleep, and today I even opened a can of dog food and took it out to the doghouse before I remembered he was gone. I guess we all miss Snoopy. I hope he's happy with Lila. [BOTH SIGH] Have you ever thought of getting another dog, Charlie Brown? No, never again. I don‘t ever want to go through such an ordeal again. [WHISTLING] [WHISTLING] [THUDDING] [GIBBERING] [WHISTLING] - Hey! He's backI - Huh? I - He's back. - He's back. - He's back. - He's back. [SINGING] Harmony is where it’s at And where it’s at for you Is where it’s at for us Share and share alike Is what it’s all about And what it’s all about Just makes it right to us Partners, pals! Comrades, chums! Buddies to the end whatever comes Me and you, a happy crew Side by side we’re uniﬁed And we will never be divided Lose or win, sink or swim We’re the best of buddies, Snoopy We’re the best of buddies We ‚re the best of buddies Me and you [SNAPPING] Look at this, Charlie Brown. "To Linus Van Pelt, I expect my croquet set and chess set returned forthwith in good order and within five days, or the matter will be turned over to my attorney." And mine says, he wants the record collection back. Mine says that since he gave me nothing, I owe him nothing. That does it, Charlie Brown! He's your dog and you're welcome to him.
