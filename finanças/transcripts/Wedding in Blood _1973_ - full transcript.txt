Please come in Before going to Paris, Mr. Delamare asked me... ...to prepare this report on the Glangeaud land... ...behind the chateau - He returns the day after tomorrow - I know, but I thought the report... ...would be safer here - Something to drink? - Gladly - Tea? - Fine - I'll do it, the maid's out - I'm a bother You don't bother me - May I help? - With pleasure I hear your wife is ill She has a chronic condition Pity I'm afraid she doesn't enjoy life much That's no reason to be ill I agree - I don't know what's come over me - Nor do I. I feel dizzy - It will be hard - Yes, horribly My angel No one makes love like you do What's that? Quiet.

I'm a leftist - So am I - But not the same Left! I must be in Paris tomorrow at 11:00 Tomorrow at 6:00pm in the chateau drawing-room This way, please, this way This gallery measures 80 yards long. A legacy of the period On the right and left two magnificent China vases The Empire drawing-room was a gift... ...from Ferdinand VII of Spain, when he stayed here six years The chairs are from St. Cyr. The carpets are authentic This is the Congress of Vienna table Please follow the guide The main gallery, with an Empire file-case... ...a bronze reproduction of Ariadne On the right, Princess Chalais, second bride of Prince Desire V On the left, a portrait of the King of Saxony by Gerard Further on, a Louis XVI chest of drawers Over it, Joseph de Talleyrand-Perigord... I'm the King of Spain! Come on You're crazy! It's safe. They close in two minutes - They'll lock us in - I've got the key - What if they find us? - There are 60 rooms Excited to make love in a historical bed? You excite me - We're the kings here! - My queen! - Shit - It's spurting all over - It's warm - So what? So it's warm I was 17 when she was born Were you in love? I'd have got rid of it, but I didn't know how to The guy ran out on me His name was Leopold. Can you imagine? - It's a name - Not in my book - And then? - I stayed in Chateauroux - What are you looking for? - A cigarette My parents took care of the baby That didn't last long I got a job in a shoe store - You went out? - A few times At the time there was an American base nearby Then my folks died, three months apart It was rough for me because I had to take the baby I kept working For over a year, it was very difficult That's where I met Paul - You were lucky - You call that being lucky Wonderful But it could have been better - What do you mean? - I'm not going to draw you a picture You see, life with him was very, very calm Very, very calm. Dead calm! - You cheated on him? - No, I never cheated on him At first I was too afraid and then later I didn't want... I didn't even think of it any more - What time is it? - 8:00. 8:30 You should have told me sooner Poor darling! Screwing in a fancy bed is a bit sordid It's better than nothing It seems some young people in the town... ...think they can do as they please. Something must be done What? Are they noisy? Yes, and their behavior is outrageous Some even camp in the chateau What's all this? Several times and in various rooms we've found cigarette butts... ...and the bedspreads all rumpled. It's scandalous We'll set up a night watch but that seems excessive The youth of today will do anything I think we should ask for police help If you wish - Pierre, see to it - Of course Why do you say it's kids? Who else could it be? It's not you... nor me. So? The police will handle it. The vandals had better behave Now where will they go? Where they went before - Coffee? - No I'm so sorry to be like this What? I'm sorry to be this way How? Always sickly It must be dull for you It was nicer when you were happy and healthy... ...but what can you do? It's not your fault With me, you always seem bored You never say anything I want to spare you a headache Don't be too cruel You think I'm cruel? No, but... You're so patient She's a sad thing She's not interested in anything. It's terrible She never wanted a baby She's afraid I'll kill her if I touch her No need. I don't touch her At times I think she's alive just to muck us up At times I think everybody's trying to muck us up I know I'm not perfect But one thing is certain - We love each other - Yes, we love each other What were you looking at? What were you looking at? The Martin boy's wedding - The doctor came by? - Yes He says to continue the same medicine... The same medicine and to take it easy - Did you eat the cold chicken? - Yes - Isn't there something you'd like? - No Nothing You don't want anything? No, nothing Don't fret about me You can't stay this way all... All the time I have to It's not much fun for you It's not a question of me Please fix my drops for me They're more and more bitter - Where are you going? - To take these books to the library Not even 50 people will read them Paul asked me to do it Good vote-getting psychology - I'll go with you - Hurry, I'm going at once - Mrs. Maury died - Mr. Maury's wife? Yes, the poor woman was sick all the time He found her when he woke this morning He called the doctor. She died in the night There was nothing left to do The doctor says she wasted away That's his official story I say it was suicide - Here are some books, Mrs. Morlon - Thank you very much - You heard about poor Mrs. Maury? - Yes, I just heard She was sick all the time "Transfactual Ethics". It must be difficult Very difficult Lucienne I'm going to Pierre Maury's. His wife died. You should come with me - Really? - Yes, I insist I'll go too. I've never seen anyone dead That interests me Your daughter's rather morbid. Death is not beautiful Then you needn't force Mum to see her The funeral is tomorrow - Nothing but gladioli? - No Bye, darling. See you Thursday Lovely bouquet. Goodbye, Clarisse Goodbye, H?l?ne ... with clearer skies for the weekend Tonight's programmes are over. Let's look at tomorrow On Channel One at 12:30... - Let's go to bed - Let me close the shutters Don't hold me tight Come on I've something to tell you I've got to tell you Clotilde didn't die naturally Yes, that's what the whole town says It was suicide It wasn't suicide It was so easy She died in her sleep She didn't care about anything Can't you say anything? That's terrible I'm not sorry When I did it, I felt liberated I'm not judging you I did it for us. To make us freer Freer... Don't say any more Paul returns tomorrow I know. He phoned and wants to see me - You don't think he... - I'm sure No, idiot, it's about some city hall business But what will we do? - We can't meet for three days? - That's wiser No one must suspect our affair - Our affair? - That's what it's called All the town is talking about her death They'd soon put two and two together Look, it's starting to get light out What time is it? 4:00 At times I think it's worse than before Almost all the nights are ours now - We can sleep together - True Forgive me. I'm always sad when I have to go Winter is coming and... ...the nights will be longer - Mum... - What are you doing up? I was thirsty and went down for a drink I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep So I went for a walk - Are you OK? - Yes The night's muggy, a storm is coming No, it's a cool night Now try to go to sleep Don't worry When I get up, I'll try to be quiet and not wake you We'll never finish The more I rake, the more there are There's your husband He looks excited Well, women, are you grooming the lawn? - Yes. - Is everything OK? - Is everything OK? - Yes We spent our time waiting for you You look a bit pale - I slept badly last night - So did I - What's wrong? - Nothing It must be the full moon - You look like two accomplices! - We are H?l?ne and I get along fine When you've finished, I've something important to tell you - What are you thinking about? - About you - Have you seen Pierre Maury? - I don't know Perhaps, but I didn't notice - He didn't speak to you? - No I'm in on a big deal. But you mustn't tell a soul - Why would I? - Close the door We could make a lot of money and at the same time... ...do some good for the town You know the Glangeaud land behind the chateau? Yes, but you know... Let me explain. The Ministry's given me... ...the go-ahead and agreed to close their eyes So I buy the land at the right time, I give half to the town... I must talk to Pierre. Will he come to lunch tomorrow? - How should I know? - I'll phone him H?l?ne, I'd like you to leave us alone - Why? - We've important matters to discuss - I can leave, too - Oh, no, darling Just me? All right A cigar? She's sweet I'll make coffee Clarisse doesn't do it right Here we go. A nice coffee. That's how to make it, Clarisse - That's how I make it - It seems not What are you doing? Last night you were with Pierre Why do you say that? I got that impression during lunch You're crazy! I have a sworn promise that if the town sells the land cheaply... ...the company will build its factory here The workers will be housed in a housing project built for them Built where? On the other piece of land. Mine - You understand? - Not completely Who will build this housing? A promoter friend of ours - Friend? - A political friend Don't worry about that. That's no problem. The problem is this. For you to make the city council accept... ...as your idea that the company should build here... ...you stress all the advantages the town would gain Real advantages. And then... ...you see to it that they give the land that I gave the town... ...to the company that will build the factory - What kind of factory? - Plastics Now I see... I'm counting on you. I don't need to tell you that this is... ...a singular chance for us all to... And the town will profit from it, too If I can count on you, I feel like going to Paris tonight... ...and telling them to set the ball rolling - Care for a drink? - Gladly Give us some of that old brandy Shall I go? Why waste any time? - He's gone? - Yes, three hours ago He wasted no time! H?l?ne suspects something - How do you know? - She told me so I trust her not to say anything We're together. Nothing else counts My poor darling What do you think of that lunch? - I don't know. - This deal he has in mind... ...is a genuine swindle He'll make a fortune at the town's expense A plastics factory! The bastard Are you sure? I thought he was honest He wants to buy me but he's wrong I can easily expose him - You seem terribly upset - For good reason Forget all that. Let's make the most of the night he's left us You love me? You love me? You're finally back - Surprised? - Well, yes... - Let go of me - I don't want H?l?ne to hear Where are you taking me? I must say I feel relaxed and light as air! Where were you? You made a fake exit? The idea just popped into my head, like that Where were you? I'm not sleeping well. I... I took a walk Don't lie. I came back at midnight I've been waiting four hours. Not impatiently! I love the night Shall I tell you what I think? You spent the night, like many others... ...with our dear friend Pierre Maury I'm going in. I'm cold I said I don't want your daughter to hear us We'll go to your room. She won't hear us Let's continue our interesting conversation in a low voice - I'm listening - Go ahead. I've nothing to say I'm right. You were with Pierre. Say it Yes, I'll say it He made love to me. Somebody has to do it! And I love making love with him All day I dream of making love with him That's fine, you're right, when one likes it Don't think I don't understand you I'm aware of my deficiencies We must make the best of it - I wouldn't want to hurt you - That's so kind of you! Do I look hurt? I find... It's very friendly of you to console a poor widower! But no one knows about it. You're careful, you hide Yes, we hide Then it's really heaven To tell you the truth... ...it suits me fine Pierre, this is Paul Delamare I'm at home. I'll explain later I'd like to see you as quickly as possible - Right away? - As quickly as possible But not here in town I have a little hut for duck hunting. See you there in one hour? All right but... This must seem strange but you'll understand Here's how to get there Such rapidity! Very kind of you - Not at all! - No doubt... My dear Pierre, all this mystery annoys you... ...yet the explanation is quite simple I wanted my wife here to avoid any ambiguity - Hello, Madame... - Please! One must sense the atmosphere. Kiss each other No, I'm not going to harm you. Not at all I sincerely offer you my friendship You sleep with my wife I hope you both find... ...all the pleasure and profit you expect and merit No problem with me on that level, believe me I love to see people happy. Otherwise, how could I run for office? - Please shut up - You think I'm indecent You expect me to play Othello! No, I'm not accommodating. I'm understanding I want everything clear and above board between us What do you say? I'm very embarrassed Don't be. Want me to thank you? I can You give Lucienne what she lacks I can't complain about that Besides, you're quite discreet considering the town gossips I'm not held up to ridicule Thank you very much I'm truly very happy.

I won't return till after tomorrow Kindly take Lucienne home. That will save me an hour You look upset. Don't be. It's all quite clear and simple Mad at me? Am I behaving badly?
