No. Why would I be nervous ? We've been together for two years, meeting your parents for the first time over Thanksgiving dinner, we're two hours late, and they're gonna blame me. No, I-I'm not nervous, honey. You have nothing to be nervous about. My father's gonna blame me entirely for this. [ Woman ] Yeah, well, I've been dreading this day for two years. - I want everything to go right. - Relax. My family-- Whoa ! Honey, I'd rather not arrive in a wheelchair, okay ? So you're saying I can't handle this road, is that what you're saying ? No, that's not what I'm saying. Yes, you are. I did race stock cars on the amateur circuit for a summer. Yes, for one summer. Yes, for an entire summer. This is nothing. I can drive this with my eyes closed. - I believe you. -[ Man ] Liar. Okay, so I don't believe you. - But I'll pass on the bet. - All right. Sixty seconds. - What ? - Gimme sixty seconds on the clock. Daniel. Daniel, open your eyes. Sixty seconds. Daniel. Daniel ! Open your eyes. -Just tell me when to-- - That's not funny. Open your eyes. -Daniel, time's up. - No, time is not up. [ Tires Screeching ] Turn ! [ Woman ] You're crazy. It's fun. Okay, you've made your point, Daniel. -[ Tires Screeching ] - [ Gasps ] You are such a... freak ! [ Engine Accelerating, Tires Screeching ] - Daniel, there's a truck ! - [ Horn Bellowing ] [ Sighing ] [ Woman ] Well. You certainly took my mind off meeting your parents, honey. [ Laughing ] [ Both Laughing ] What are you doing ? [ Chuckles ] No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. See, now we are really going to be late. [ Daniel ] Ow ! Take this off. Oh, no. No, we really don't have time. We don't have time for this. We do have time. Wait a minute. [ Grunting ] I got it. Do you think your mother's gonna like me ? Can we not talk about my mother right now ? Okay. Hurry up. I'm trying. Hold-- Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Oh. Okay. Yeah. You all right ? [ Laughing ] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, fine. Sure. Right. I wouldn't miss it. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. Yup. Bye-bye. Everything okay ? Yeah. Honey ? Hey, you okay ? Yeah. You know, I am no longer interested in teaching English. Oh, honey, don't tell me you're gonna quit. No, I'm not gonna quit. You sound like my father. No. I'm just gonna, you know, move on. Is there a difference ? Yes. Quitting means not finishing. I've taught the whole year. I've had the experience. Now it's finished. [ Sighs ] You'll miss the kids. Yes, but will they miss me ? You get this impression when you're standing in front of them... that you're making English so dreary for them. You know ? When work is made detestable by slavery, there is no art. See, now that is exactly why you should be teaching. Because you say things like that. Oh. Yes, but I didn't say that. Bernard Shaw said that, which is exactly the point. The point... is that you are a hopeless romantic. Oh. [ Chuckling ] - Is that a problem ? - No, it's not a problem. It's part of what I love about you. I just think that sometimes it causes you unnecessary conflict. Yeah. Well, at least I feel like something's going on inside me, like I'm alive. Oh, no. Uh-oh. [ Daniel ] Yup. [ Woman Laughs ] Once more. [ Daniel ] It's like a small organic farm north of the city. They're looking for someone to oversee the place. "Organic farm" ? Yeah. What do they grow ? Mushrooms, but i-i-it's not-- [ Laughing ] What ? Like, psychedelic mushrooms ? No, no, no, no. Not that kind. It's like a shiitake mushroom. Portobella mushrooms. Uh, you know, it's completely on the up-and-up. We could just live there on the farm. Everything's solar-powered. We wouldn't see an electric bill for years. It sounds so bohemian. Well, you know. Hey, right over here. That's where me and John used to ride our bikes in the summer. Oh, really ! What ? It's just so beautiful. Usually when you talk about your childhood, you make it sound like you grew up in a tenement. Well, the rich suffer too, Susanne. Don't look now but here we are. Not too shabby. Yep. Dad's own little Utopia. - The gate didn't shut. - I know. Kills my father. Ready ? Yup. Oh, uh, d-d-don't mention John unless Mom does first. She will. It's just you never know how she's gonna respond. You'd think the funeral was yesterday. Honey, relax. I am trying. They're just people, you know ? I know, I know. It's no big deal. [ Door Chimes ] If it's no big deal, how come you didn't invite me here two years ago ? I wanted to make sure you were "Miss Right," not just "Miss Right Now." -[ Door Opening ] - Aw, Daniel, my boy. How the hell are ya ? Uncle Wilson, this is Susanne. Susanne, this is my father's brother, Wilson. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Likewise, I'm sure. Well, come on inside. The family's all waiting. We were, uh, beginning to think that you'd met with foul play. Even your normally unflappable brother was becoming concerned. [ Chuckles ] Come on in. I thought you called. They never hear a word I say. [ Daniel ] Hey, Allen. Hey, Kyle. This is Susanne. Hi. Well, thank goodness you finally made it. Hello, Mother. How are you ? - This must be Susanne. - Yes. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Likewise. Daniel's so secretive about his private life. My late son John was just the opposite. An open book. Well, come on, you two. There's still time for a drink before dinner. Wonderful. Oop. Sorry. [ Woman ] I've been looking forward to a new house. [ Man ] Oh, me too. [ Woman Speaking, Indistinct ] [ Woman #2 ] She sounded wonderful. [ Guests Chattering ] - [ Woman ] That would be nice. - [ Woman #2 ] I believe you're right here next to me. - How wonderful. - Father. I trust you were in a major accident. Actually, we, uh, we decided to take the scenic route, but I appreciate the sentiment. Do move over one, Daniel. That's John's chair. I didn't realize John was coming tonight, did you, Justin ? My prodigal brother returns to help stir the shit. - So how's it hangin' ? - Oh, it's about half-mast, but it's still flaggin'. [ Chuckling ] I shall soon be blissfully drunk and blissfully unaware. Here. Oh, I-I don't eat green. Thank you. So, Daniel, how's the house painting business ? I don't paint houses anymore. I've been teaching English for the past year. Really ? Well, it's so hard to keep up with the spiritual journey. [ Chuckling ] [ Chuckling ] Well, at least he's out of that cult. Buddhist study group hardly meets the criteria for a cult. Well, we were all terribly worried. -Weren't we, Marilyn ? -Yes, we were. - [ Father ] If everyone has their wine, I'll make a toast. - Justin may need some. Oh, I'll get it. Oh. I-I'm sorry. [ Guests Murmuring ] It's okay, Wilson. [ Man Cackling ] [ Man ] Pass this down. Ah. [ Woman ] I'm fine, thanks. Thank you, Justin. The walls of these rooms tell the story of this family. They represent our tradition... of hard work, stability, beauty and art. And where's that vision now ? I'll tell you. It's in the hands of a generation that would rather race cars... than put in an honest day's work. A generation that wants to be indulged... instead of making a contribution. My son John shared that vision with me, and I thought I heard these walls crumble when he died. Is it all going to end with me ? That's what I want to know. Can you really let this all end with me ? I pray that we all use the rest of the coming year... to do in our hearts what we know is right... and to finally succeed in putting our tragedies behind us. Hear ! Hear ! -[ Woman ] Cheers. - [ Bearded Man ] Cheers. [ Wilson ] You should really quit that, Jack. It's gonna kill you just like it did Dad. Nonsense. There's no better digestive aid than a good cigar. Now what were you going on about ? I was trying to explain to you for the umpteenth time... the appeal of postmodernism. Not this again. Can't we talk about football instead ? Oh, really, Allen. You should, uh, broaden your interests, my boy. ♪♪ [ Piano ] ♪♪ [ Playing Classical Piece Off-Key ] [ Cackles ] That's it ? That's all I can remember. I stopped playing the damn thing when I was nine. Couldn't stand to practice ? He only started because John played too, and then when John decided to quit to paint, Daniel followed suit. Yeah, well-- Sounds like you did everything John did. He was my older brother. I worshipped the guy-- at least until he joined Dad's business. John was the golden boy, all right. He could have been any kind... if not for his desperate need for his dad's approval. That was his Achilles' heel. John wanted me to join the business too. You flatter yourself. It's true. It was the only way he could justify selling out his own talent. And you know what the worst part is ? John had decided to stop buying paintings and start making them again. That's bullshit. What makes you think that ? - He told me so. - Before he died ? No, last night in my sleep. Yes, just before he died. I thought you knew that. Excuse me. I wonder what got into him. I think it's just the whole family holiday thing. He's a bit overwhelmed. You should have told me, John. ♪♪ So... what is our young hero going to do next ? He mentioned something about organic farming. [ Chuckling ] [ Nervous Chuckle ] Mushrooms. Organic farming ? He's gonna kill Dad yet. It's just a phase. Yeah. I believe they call that adolescence. And you ? How are you faring in the rat race ? - I'm a family counselor. - [ Suppressed Chuckle ] Well, you've certainly come to the right place. Is this lot screwed up or what ? [ Laughing ] -You seemed to come out okay. -Oh, hardly. I'm 36 years old, unaccomplished-- unless we're counting incipient alcoholism-- and I'm still living in the bedroom where I spent... my troubled childhood. And like my late brother, I'm a junkie for my father's... approval. I've made you uncomfortable. That's okay. It's okay, Justin. Really, it's okay. - Would you like a drink ? - I don't drink. Uh-oh. Hey, Danny. I wanna know what you're gonna do. I think I'm gonna go visit Susanne and Justin over by the piano. Do you really think you can afford to piss me off right now ? I know we've had our differences, a-a-and I apologize for that. I do. And I'm sorry if I've upset you or I've disappointed you, but, you know something, that doesn't change the fact that I respect you. You know ? And I respect that you've brought this business from nothing. I really do. And I am more than flattered that you're willing to pass the torch to me, but you have to respect the person that I am. I am not the man for this job. I don't have it in me. Look, Danny, John is gone. You're my last chance. Justin would be more than willing to take over-- Justin's too weak ! I sometimes wonder if he's really my flesh and blood. No, Danny, I need you. I can't do it. Oh, Dad, please. I'm not-- I just don't have it in me. I'm asking for your blessing. [ Exhaling ] [ Stammering ] I'm begging for it. I'm sorry. You can't have it. Once I threatened to cut you off from every dime you get from this family. It's about time I made good on that threat. Am I interrupting ? No, no, no. Not at all. Matter of fact, maybe you can talk some sense into him. You seem to have your act pretty well together. Thank you. Good. I'll leave you to it, then. You have the weekend, Danny. The weekend for what ? He's still trying to get me to join the business. What are you gonna do ? Right now I'd like to get the fuck outta here. Do you wanna go get some fresh air ? I have a better idea. So this is it. [ Daniel ] Yeah. Kinda cool, huh ? [ Susanne ] Yeah. It's really cool. [ Woman Laughing, Foot Stomping ] You can hear everything that's going on upstairs.

After a while, you forget there are even people up there. You just... hear steps. Walk around, bumping-- Ai-ee-- [ Laughs ] bumping into things. Your head pointed up at the ceiling, getting dizzy. What's this ? Oh, that's a, uh-- That's a sketch for a mural John and I were working on. Why didn't you finish it ?

Well, then come down to the basement with me. It would mean a lot to me. Okay. No. Let go of me ! Please, please. Please. Okay. Sit down. Do you know the story of Lot and his wife ? Tsk. [ Snorts ] Susanne. When God decided He was gonna destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, He told Lot and his family that they could leave on one condition: That when they did, they couldn't look back. 'Cause if they did, they too would be destroyed. Lot, he did as was God's will. But Lot's wife, she, uh-- she had to have a little look. It's a good drawing, Daniel. [ Scoffing ] Shut up. It's you and me, Susanne. I don't understand. You see, um-- See, I-I-I created a destruction like this one so that we could start over. You looked back. When-- When did you first begin to doubt me, hmm ? My life is my art. [ Chuckles ] But they refused to see me as an artist. So did you. I'm sure that nobody meant to-- Discourage me ? No. To-To-To inhibit my creative instincts ? [ Laughs ] To hurt you. But they did. And now they're part of a performance piece. [ Laughs ] That's funny, isn't it ? You did a really bad thing here, Daniel. No. I did a perfect thing. Everyone dead except for you and me. I'd sneak up into my dad's study and get the gun. Justin screwed up that part. [ Laughs ] I'd come down and fearlessly kill the thieves. You'd be here to corroborate the whole story. But now I have to kill you. You don't want to kill me. No. No. But why not ? Because you love me. Oh. But I loved John. But I killed him. "John's too good a climber to fall off a cliff." Push. [ Weeping ] [ Sobbing ] [ Grunts ] Susanne ? Susanne ! [ Man Over Phone ] It's gonna be a bloodbath, Justin. I wouldn't miss it. Susanne ! Susanne ! Susanne ! I'll go get help. Susanne ! Protect yourself. Honey-- Come on ! [ Car Alarm Sounding ] [ Alarm Continues ] No. No. "I Married a Millionaire" by Susanne Berison. That's the story of your life, isn't it ? [ Alarm Continues ] [ Sobbing ] [ Gasps ] [ Engine Cranking ] Come on ! Please ! Come on. Come on ! Let me help you. [ Grunts ] Compared to you, Lot's wife was a piece of cake. If you kill me, they'll know. So what do you suggest ? Let me go. I'll tell them anything, say we were in the basement. You'd really lie for me like that ? Yeah. [ Laughing ] Right. Get in the house. [ Grunting ] [ Choking ] Please. [ Choking ] - Let her go. - Little late to rebel, isn't it, Justin ? Shut up ! Move-- It is not so easy to kill someone, Susanne. Just point and shoot. Isn't that what you said ? Huh ? Still with me ? [ Whispering ] You better believe it. [ Chuckles ] ♪♪
