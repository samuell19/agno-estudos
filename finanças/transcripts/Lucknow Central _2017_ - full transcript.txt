You've been mumbling, "I need money." I'll figure out something, father. -You keep it. -No, you keep it. Now tell me, what will you do with this money? I'll record a song in Delhi. My posters will be everywhere along with my band. We small town people shouldn't dare to dream big. Father, the towns may be small, but dreams have no limit. What a statement! On that note, how about you sing a song for me -in English? -I see. -Yes. -Fine. "This is the song of the angel hearted" "It's my song now and ever."

I am innocent, father! These people are lying! I haven't done anything. Leave me. Isn't that you and your friend Bunty? Yes? Better speak up now.

Speak up. -Kishan didn't kill him, sir. -Let me make it clear, boy. Or else, you'll be standing on gallows with Kishan. Become a witness and say exactly like I tell you, to the court. Sir, we had a scuffle with the IAS officer outside Parwani stadium. He needed some money. We saw the IAS officer's car parked in front. He took his revenge and the money. -He picked up an iron rod and... -Bunty?! -What are you saying, Bunty? -Took him at the back, and swung the rod really hard. That never happened, your honor. -What are you saying, Bunty? -Be quiet. Be quiet. Let him speak. And the officer died on the spot. -He took his revenge and -What are you saying, Bunty? Take him out of the court room. You are like my Brother. What are you saying, Bunty? I said take him out. Sir, he's lying. Kishan Mohan Girhotra is sentenced to life for the murder of -IAS officer Dilip Kumar. -Bunty. You guys, wait. I'll talk to the jailor. Gayu, we run an NGO. If we keep getting involved in your agitation then someday we'll get kicked out of here. This system will never change without an agitation. -Gayu. -Just wait and watch what I do. Who gave permission to shoot a film in here? She was the Union Minister's daughter, ma'am. So? -She came here to make a film. -Show me the letter. The Minister must have sent a written letter. Show me. The Department or the Administration doesn't need a written permission. -Is it? -Yeah. Relationships thrive on goodwill. They are prisoners and not some zoo animals who you can put on display for the guests. And, why are they kneeling down? Hey. No cheating. You know what, go and ask the higher officials. -Don't ask me. -Fine. Better hold on to your seat, because -I am going to take this to the IG. -Most welcome. Hey! stand up, stand up. Camera's are not allowed in here, madam. -We'll complain about this. -Most welcome. Only palms have lines, madam. Frowning doesn't suit on your face. My mother used to say it. You should try smiling sometimes. -You look really happy. -Why shouldn't I? I am getting a chance to appeal. My lawyer is coming to see me personally. One more thing, ma'am. I can't perform at the 26th January function. Because I am getting out of here. -Hey! You come here. -Sir. Kishan. Kishan. Here. -Greetings, brother. -Greetings. -How are you? -Great! What about you? Well, I have a good news and a bad news for you. Great! Meaning, you have the water ready -to put out the fire, after you start it. -No no. No fire. But, I can't appeal anymore. Before I could appeal for you the IAS officer's family filed a petition in High Court. They are demanding death penalty. But, I requested the Public Prosecutor. For a meeting. Don't be scared, Kishan. We'll approach every MP, MLA, and Minister if we have to. Don't worry. Don't worry at all. Brother, please take the matter to the higher authorities. "We all say, Happy Birthday to you" Long live the CM Long live the CM -Sir, IG sir. -Thank you very much. The traffic arrangements were just wonderful. Sir, IG of prisons. Remember, Lucknow Jail. All the uniforms look so similar that it's hard to figure out. Please, sit down. Not your fault, sir. I am sure, Satyanarayan already had a word with you. This time, I want to organize the Prison Band Competition in Lucknow Central Jail. Ok. Sir, if you could consider a different place. Where? Father wants it to be in Lucknow Central. We'll invite the Central Ministers and will pressurize them, to allot more funds for jails. And you want me to do it somewhere else instead of Lucknow, our very own capital. Sir, the filth from all over the state are dumped in Lucknow Central Jail. We've got some pretty fierce inmates. This prison band competition which is being organized for the last 10 years has seen the least participation from Lucknow central. Whereas Naini, Allahabad, Banaras, Agra. The number of participants from these four jails are maximum. You see, the inmates at Lucknow central are made of a different DNA. Then form a band, that's not a good reason. Form a band! What's it called, where actors pretend while the singers stand at the back and sing. -Lip sync. -Yes, do that. Give them a guitar, a drum and a harmonium. They will create an electrifying atmosphere and Lucknow central will get popular. Sir, Lucknow central is slightly difficult to handle. There are security concerns, sir. There's a risk of inmates escaping. So, the hosting of this festival at Lucknow central is not a good idea, sir. Father said it'll be at Lucknow Central When and how, the security is your problem. You're the in-charge, so it's your responsibility. Don't try to sweet talk me. And if you fail. I'll transfer you over to traffic police. Even the uniform is same. -Good joke, sir. -It's not a joke. I am being honest. Be serious. Gayatri, please. Be patient with him. And, control your temper. Of course, why would I lose my temper. I meditated in the morning. Don't worry. Look, Gayu. You already have a problem with the system. We're only worried that you might see something wrong -and start yelling. -I won't scream at the IG. We'll have a decent conversation. Come Madam. Tell the jailor. Tell the Jailor to issue orders immediately. We need a band at Lucknow central jail, that's all. What do you mean 'How'? Just form a band, that's it! -Yes? -Sir, Gayatri Kashyap. Get straight to the point! Your officers are just pathetic! Our NGO has done extensive work in many jails of UP for reformation of criminals. And currently, we're working in Moradabad jail for the 26th January celebrations. They allowed a camera in jail, because she was the Minister's daughter. Add to it Section 36 and Section 37 'Indiscipline by on-duty SO' 'for flouting norms and causing agony to convicts.' Sir, this also reminds me of Section 29. Uniform officer giving physical punishment to convicts. They made them kneel down, sir. What is this? And that SO doesn't even wear his cap, sir. Do you. know music? What do you mean? All of a sudden? Gayatri, sir. She never listens to anyone. The IG asked her to make a band at Lucknow central jail. But she clearly refused. She said, "Our job is not making bands, it's reformation!" She lost her job, and we lost our project. State vs Kishan Mohan Girhotra. So, you want to move to the High Court? Yes, sir. Are you not happy with the life sentence? Death is the only justice in this high-profile case, sir. There's an outrage in the public. The victim's family must get justice. I see. Justice? You make it sound like, it's a piece of cake. Everyone wants a piece of it! Fine. Go to High Court. Demand death sentence. Your honor. Your honor, demanding death sentence without evidence is He's already serving life sentence, sir. Next hearing. Your honor. Please reconsider. If you could please reconsider. Your honor. Kishan. "O life, there could not be a mix Of my colors with your colors" We small town people shouldn't dare to dream big. Father, the towns may be small, but dreams have no limits. Status quo has changed, ma'am. For you and for 1821. Five minutes. Thank you for coming, madam. Your lawyer said you wanted to meet. Look, frankly, there's nothing I can do. -My job. -You and I are like parallel lines, madam. Do you understand parallel? Parallel lines. Parallel lines run parallel to each other and meet only at infinity, madam. I didn't understand. I am talking about meeting at infinity. Lucknow central. I am being transferred to Lucknow central. And, I know you've received an offer -to make a band. -What are you trying to say? I have a request. I want you to take up that offer to form a band. It will even get you your job back. You mean, I should help you to get my job back? To fulfill my dream. I always wanted to form a band. I'll be your first volunteer. You can't make a band with one man. It's my job to recruit other people. -It's not easy to convince them. -It'll be my job to convince them. Will they allow you? That's your job. This is why I called you here, madam. "O life, there could not be a mix Of my colors with your colors" Take off your clothes. Turn around. Front again. Hands up. Spread the fingers. Look down. Dust your hair. Straighten your neck again. Open your mouth. Yeah. Here. Now go. Next. Vegetarian or non-vegetarian? Ohh, poor guy can't speak. Mishra put him in the handicapped section. Go on, son. Next. 1821. Vegetarian or non-vegetarian? Can't speak? Mishra, the guys at Moradabad haven't mentioned that he's handicapped. Then, what's the problem? -Why aren't you speaking? -Maheshwari. Stop troubling the kid. He's had a long journey. Must be tired. Right? Let him rest. Come, son. I'll escort you personally. Let's go. Did they feed you properly during the journey? I hope it wasn't too taxing? Great. And, if you've any grievances with us then we have a grievance book. -Suggestion book. -Yeah. Suggestion book. You can write your suggestion. And we'll deal with it. Downstairs. You see, we live here like a family. One family, always together. Come on. What happened, son? What are you thinking? I get it. You haven't seen anything like this before. This is just the beginning. There's much more to see. Come, I'll show you. Come on. Come. Come. Come, son. Careful. Careful. He's trying really hard. -Tripathi. -Yes, sir. Is the noose tight enough? -Super tight, sir. -Good. -Maheshwari. -Sir. Why is he struggling so much? Does he want to say something? -But, the poor guy can't speak. -Yeah we've forgotten. Then, why is he struggling so much? -Maheshwari. -Sir. -Are we making a mistake? -Tie his hands. Let's take a look at the court orders again. -Yes, here you go. -What's written. Sir, the printout has faded. Sir, I think he's been given a death sentence. Are you sure? Sir, they've demanded. It's a demand? It's pending, sir. -It's confirmed. -No, sir, it's still pending. It's confirmed. Wait, man. -Maheshwari. -Sir. What's written here? If he's given a death sentence, and we don't hang him then the court will come after us. True. Then what should we do? -Move. -Sir. -Tripathi. -Yes, sir. Hang him. Welcome to Lucknow central. Mrs Jailor. You see, I am her prisoner. Are you married? -What? -Just a question. I was surprised to see you. I mean, you've the figure of a model. You're educated. Belonging to a high caste. Kashyap. -Progressive, sir. -Yes. I have a free advice for you. Find a nice, decent, guy and get married. You'll be happy. You're always spending time in the company of these criminals. I don't like that. They are societal filth, just like garbage. Look, my job here is to form a band. And, prisoner no. 1821 will help me. I've already presented his credentials to the IG. And, you've his orders. So, please get him out of solitary. He'll be useful to us. You're unbelievable, Ms. Gayatri. These people are no saints, they won't be a part of your charade. Ms. Gayatri, this is Lucknow central jail. We believe in punishment, not reformation. We've already explained you. The rest is on you and the IG. Maheshwari, hand me a pen. I'll sign it. -Shukla. -Yes. -How about a betel leaf? -Right away, sir. Think about marriage! How are you? Madam. Are you sure you will be able to form a band? Just a week, madam.

Volunteer for the band. Hey, what are you doing? Now entry for volunteer will start. -Hey what's happening there. -Let's get out, quickly. Walk fast! The jailor had already warned you. What are you still doing here? You already signed up. Now go. Long live India, sir. Want to talk to your sweetheart? Victor, make the call for Pali. Hey, what are you doing? What happened to the powercut? -Chaurasia, you rascal. -Shastri, you scoundrel. Mishra, your father's a thief. You bloody. Five, four, three, two and one. That's a nice tune you're humming! Would you like to join the band? You can at least hum your name. -Hello, sir. -Hello, sir. Hello, Ms. Gayatri. Please, sit down. Please sit. How are you? What's going on here? Band nominations. 1821. It's a struggle, isn't it? Get them some tea. Hey handsome. I've the best arrangement for releasing your load. I wanted to speak to you about the band. It's a quotation for music instruments. We need your approval. What's the point of all this? CM sir has already sent invitations from the CMO. Will your band be ready? Will 1821 be able to handle it? Hey, you. Come here. A tailor can also cut clothes with his hands. And, we don't need a blade Convey this message to your leader. You too. What? This? -Are you crazy? -I see. -You lying. -Hey, what are you doing? What are you made of? You haven't eaten for three days straight and have been living on water. Are you planning to die? I don't want to die. But, people won't stop until they kill me. I'll talk to Tilakdhari, ok. You can eat this time. I'll survive on water. You have this tattoo of 'Religion Rock' on your back. Are you interested in music? Are you crazy? I am talking about food and you're talking about music. Have you seen the posters about the band? I didn't come here to form a band. I didn't come here to form a band either. The plan is something else. How are we going to escape? We'll get certain benefits. We can plan during practice sessions. This is a high-security jail. I want to know, how are we going to escape? On the day of the competition, 15th August. Independence Day. That's a good day. But, how are we going to escape? There's going to be a function. Ministers will attend it. Other. As well as inmates from other jail. We'll use this opportunity to disguise ourselves and escape. Come here. Is this just an idea or, have you worked on it? The IG asked her to form a band at Lucknow central jail. But she clearly refused. It's my dream to make a band. It's not that easy to make a band. You dont worry. I'll be the first volunteer. I know every corner of the jail. Number of police officers, fuse-boxes, everything. The duration between the power cut and when the generators turn back on, is only 15 seconds. So, why have you chosen me? First reason, you're serving a life sentence. You don't have a choice. And second, you're an engineer. You can find technical solutions. Hey. Look. I don't want to get electrocuted. -What say, Victor? -Just the two of us? We've to form a band, and not a duet singing. We'll need more guys, lifers. You find them, I'll convince them. -Do it properly. -Yes, sir. Dikkat Ansari, 1026. Loot, half-murder case. He's been here for a year. He's the cleaning guy.

He even stitches uniforms for the police officers. He wants to go out for his daughter's wedding but, his parole's been rejected. So what do you suggest, should we get her married here? You just perform the rituals. Let's go, Bindiya. Come on. I said let's go. Parminder Gill aka Pali, 1414. His elder brother said that the contractor is our enemy, kill him. He didn't think twice before killing him. It's a love story too. His sweetheart is outside and he's inside. He tried to escape many times, but failed. And you know all about me.

Pali, die you scoundrel. Who the hell abused me? Get lost. I don't want to escape. You'll be selling adult magazines for the rest of your life in here. Doesn't matter. It's better than the jailor whooping my ass. Brother Dikkat. Are you going to shoot your load in Lucknow central for the rest of your life? Once you get out of here, then no more theory only practical. Dewdrops can't quench your thirst. Hey, pigeons, stop talking. Yes, sir. You go. Hey, 1821. Come here. Come on. Come on. Come.

I, Vijay Dinanath Chauhan. -And myself. -Kancha, who lives in a glass palace. I've met you before. When I was a kid, I used to clean your car. With a cloth. And now, you want to get in my clothes.

But, you want to talk to your darling. You were scared out there. And you want to talk to your darling. Bloody coward! You're good for nothing. You want to talk to your darling? No one else should know about this other than us. And remember, don't break each other's trust and don't suspect each other. Ok.

Which Pali? -What Pali? -I am Pali. -I want to join the band too. -We need only four members for the band. There's four of us. -Then I'll kill one. -We don't need you. But I do, Panditji. Like I said, I want to join the band. Pali, we are not talking about changing truck's stepney. This is about music. -You need talent for that. -I know how talented you guys are. I don't want to spend the rest of my life licking Tilakdhari's feet. I am not going to talk to my sweetheart on the phone anymore. We're going to talk face to face. Person to person.

So, will you let me join now? 1414, Parminder Gill. 753, Purshottam Pandit. 1026, Dikkhat Ansari. 1759, Victor Chattopadhyay. And, Kishan Mohan Girhotra, 1821. Here it is sir. The band from Lucknow Central. So, the band's ready. Let's hear something. -Sir, there was once a parrot... -Hey. What kind of a man are you? -Mishra. -Yes, sir. Bring their instruments! -But sir, they haven't practiced yet. -I know. But let's see whether they have any scope, or not. -Don't you have a saxophone? -No. -How do you play this thing? -Blow here. This side. Panditji, hold it straight. Not like that. Panditji. -Have you played this thing before? -Yes. Wait. It'll start from there. Come on. Play. Which song? "Pardesi-Pardesi." Nadeem Shravan. -Taal Deepchandi. -Deepchand, who? -What are you talking about? -What are you talking man? Micheal Jackson. Something in Punjabi, please. "Foreigner, foreigner, don't go" "Don't go and leave me" "Foreigner, my friend, Keep your promise!" "Remember me, don't somehow forget!" "Foreigner, foreigner, don't go" "Don't go and leave me" Panditji. Great. Really great. Good. -Practise hard, ok. -Yes, sir. Practice more. It's just the first day, so. With your permission, can I say something, sir? Go on. This band, it's just a sham. They are planning something else. Out. These five are going to escape. God knows what's going on in there. What do you think? That jailor must be suggesting new ways for torturing us. Like, will they be hanging us upside down or make us lie down. He's just guessing. He doesn't know. 1026, Dikkat Ansari. He works as a cleaner here. He's allowed in every room. Meaning, getting an imprint of every lock is easy for him. 1414, Pali. He works in the Fabrication Unit. He'll make a key with Dikkat's imprint. 753, Pandit. He's got a direct involvement, sir. He works in the Tailoring Unit. He can supply them with clothes to disguise themselves. -1759, Victor. -He was an engineer, sir. Did I ask you? No, right? He's an engineer, sir. He'll give them technical solutions. And, in the end Madam's very own fanboy Her favorite, 1821. Kishan Girhotra, sir. I've had our eyes on him since he got here, sir. I assure you, he's the mastermind of this entire plan. Think about it, sir. Four inmates, serving life sentence and one, with a death sentence, it's the perfect plan. Sir, these are just assumptions. I've been handling this jail for 15 years, sir. I can even tell you the number of cobwebs in every corner of this jail. Brother, take my advice, let's surrender. We'll tell jailor about the plan. This way, our punishment won't be too severe. -Are you crazy? -I am going to tell, Sir. Listen to me. You'll be safe. I made this band. If anyone gets punished for this, then it'll be me. Have faith. Yeah? Yeah! He's watching. Sir, again I'm telling you, these are just assumptions. Did anyone ask for your advice? Do I look stupid? Go home, get married and settle down. Start a family. You've no business here. Don't you dare dismiss me like that! Even I don't believe in this band. -But, I believe in reformation. -What reformation, madam? This is a jail. They are prisoners. They are here to serve their sentence and not turn over to a new leaf. I've seen prisoners turn over to a new leaf. Give them one chance. What chance, sir? Should we allow them to escape? This band is just an excuse. They are not going to learn any music. They are planning to escape from here, I assure you. If that's the case, then I'll vouch for them. They will learn music -and I'll teach them. -Shut up! Security is your responsibility, right? Yes, sir. Then, do your job. Or, should I start thinking about transferring you into traffic police. -Even the uniform's same. -I apologize sir. And listen, you. Pay attention to the music. These agitations can put your job at risk. It's done. Your band has been formed. Lucknow central. -Practice, ok. -Yes, sir. Aren't you getting too involved with this band? It'll change the lives of five people. And, I've challenged that jailor too. I am going to teach them music. So, shall we start? -Are you Bengali? -No. How will you teach us music? We don't have to learn Bengali. Yes, please begin. Panditji, shall we begin with you? Do... Do... Do... Re... Ok. Re... Re... He sings well. Mi... -Mi... -I had told you to let me kill him. Mi... Fa... -Fa... -Very good. First, explain to me why we need this? Well, the jailor's getting too suspicious. We'll just pretend, that's all. "Hey, remember the theory of Thomas Edison" "Remember the theory of Thomas Edison" "Light that bulb in your head Don't waste your time" "Remember the theory of Thomas Edison" "Light that bulb in your head Don't waste your time" "This is the formula, brother Try you best" "This is the formula, brother Try you best" "Be positive and pick up The pieces of your heart" "Pick up the pieces of your heart" "Forget all your worries And shake a leg" "And leave the rest to God" There are too many keys? Do... Do... Once again. It also has drums. Do... I can't do it. No. You'll get it, Panditji. You will. Madam, we must change the method. "It's a simple thing, Don't confuse yourselves" "This is my suggestion, Don't lose your temper at all" "Failure is the first step to success" "Every failure has a special ability" "Falling down and getting Back up again is an art" -First, take a look. -Yeah. "When you finish, it's also Beginning of something new" -What happened? -Kishan. I am going to show you something amazing. It'll drive you crazy. Come on. Wow. Very nice. -I am really happy. -I am still trying to perfect it. You should dance like this at the main wall. Yeah. Where is the resistor? Do... re... mi... Sir, these locks are rusty. Change it. Takes time to clean them. Get lost! Start cleaning. "Use Graham Bell's phone To call up your fate" "Hang up after saying I'll never give up" "Show your courage Say your intentions" -Wow, Panditji. -Not wow. Wo... "Be positive, collect All your tears in a bucket" "Collect all your tears in a bucket Collect all your tears in a bucket" Are you going to turn the entire jail dark? You're so ambitious. Let me turn off this section first. Hey Tilakdhari. Idiot. Wait a minute. -Let's go. -Wait. -What are you doing? -Wait. -Tilakdhari, you bloody beggar. -Wash your hands, Tilakdhari. Who abused me? "Forget all your worries And shake a leg" "And leave the rest to God" We stay awake while they sleep. It's not good. Do... re... mi... fa... Let's wake them up. Check inside four number room. "Forget all your worries And shake a leg" Check that corner. "Forget all your worries And leave rest to God" Can you do it so quickly? Good. -Wow. -Nice. Guys, my mind's working like lightning. All I can think about is the happiness after I am free. Me too, Panditji. I'll catch a Duronto and straight to Kolkata. To see my father. First, he'll be angry. He'll hit me. Well, he has the right. I've troubled him so much. But, he's my father after all. I'll convince him. Then straight to Bhutan with him. I've heard their happiness Index is the highest. Even I will take my sweetheart Veera somewhere. Not Bhutan, but either South or Gujarat. Somewhere far. Won't you guys have sex? He'll catch the Duronto. You'll travel down to south. Have pity on yourselves. If you get cursed. Then all your plans will be foiled. Oh stupid! What is your plan, brother? Plan is to escape. But, my dream is to form a band. My very own band. Once I get on stage, I'll give everyone else a run for their money. Huge crowd. People clapping in sync, and screaming just one name. Kishan! Kishan! Kishan! Kishan! The jailor's called all of you. How's your practice going on? Great. Good. Good. So, sing something for me. -What? -Song. What the hell. You don't need the instruments. You are practicing enough, aren't you? -Maheshwari. -Sir. -Shoot them. -But, I don't have a gun, sir. -I meant with a camera. Shoot a video. -Yes, sir. -Ready? -Almost, sir. Do you know how to do it? There's a small dot, just slide that and It will switch to video mode. -Done? -Done, sir. Ready. Now, we'll take this video to the opposition. Make an issue out of it. And then will shut this band. Will prove that you're all failures. Start now. Come on, start. But, we've only learned Do Re Mi. So, let's sing that. "Do..." "Re..." "Mi..." "Do..." "Do Re..." "Fa... so... la..." "Do... re... mi..." “Why wait for anyone?” "Do Re..." “Let’s start the celebrations” "Fa... so... la..." “Why wait for anyone?” “Let’s start the celebrations” “As the beat slowly picks up” "We’re going to sway” “We’ll shake a leg to the beat” "When they play a song that's super” “One pigeon, Two pigeons, three pigeons” “Partying on the rooftop” “One pigeon, Two pigeons, three pigeons” “Partying on the rooftop” “After a few pegs down” "The heart beats Aloud like a woofer” "The heart beats Aloud like a woofer” “One pigeon, Two pigeons, three pigeons” "Do... re... mi..." "Do Re..." "Do... re... mi..." "Fa... so..." “We’ve got style and attitude” “Treating scooter like a Ferrari” “All set to drop to beat” “Sir, do you get the hint?” “It’s true what I say, but Don't let the secret leak” “Time for less talk and more work” “We’re going to break out of the cage” “No more staying cooped Up in this prison” “Amongst zeros, Zero is the leader” “If we win, They will call us cheater” “We’re burning our blood Like the midnight oil” “Once we're free, We’ll fly away like free bird” “Once we're free, We’ll fly away like free bird” “One pigeon, Two pigeons, three pigeons” “Partying on the rooftop” “One pigeon, Two pigeons, three pigeons” “Partying on the rooftop” “After a few pegs down” "The heart beats Aloud like a woofer” “The heart beats Aloud like a woofer” “One pigeon, Two pigeons, three pigeons” “We keep singing As the sun goes down” “The party looks brighter now” “The entire town looks Like they are high” “But our heart seems down” “I am scared, my liver’s Going to give up sooner or later” Stop singing. Stop this charade. Come on. Stop making a commotion. Come on. Don't look around. Keep walking straight. "Do..." "Re... mi... do" "Re... mi... do" "Do... re... mi..." "Fa... so..." "Do... re... mi... Do" "Do... re... mi... Do" "Fa... so..." "Do... re... mi... Do" "Fa... so..." "Do... re... mi... Do" "Fa... so..." Quiet! -Come on. -Get back inside. Get back in. -Get back in. -What are you looking at? -Get back in. -What are you looking at? -Sir. -Get back in. I wanted to thank you, sir. We're all big failures, sir. Ramanajun said, 'Zero has no value alone.' Almost non-existent. But, if you associate it with a number its value increases. -You turned us into one too. -What nonsense. I sang and danced at a lot of places sir. Weddings, birthdays, Council offices, fields but, I could never form a band. I tried really hard, but couldn't do it. You see, you don't need instruments to make a band. All you need are people, who can sing in tune? You just did that, sir. You made us sing in sync. You made us worth something. Thank you. -Lock them up. -Sir. Hey. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. You were amazing, Kishan. You were amazing, buddy. It was Madam. Did we really make a band? Did you see? Panditji, Victor, Dikkat. They sang, they danced. Madam is amazing. Are you happy or worried? What do you mean? Brother, band or freedom? To hell with that Gayatri Kashyap. She's disrupting my quiet life. -On the rocks. -Sir. IG sir and CM sir, have lost their mind too. They want to make Lucknow central band in Lucknow central jail. Sir. -That was sister-in-law, sir. -Why are you worried? -Stay. -Sorry, sir. -I asked you to make a video. -I did, sir. Make it viral on the internet. -Do you know how it's done? -Yes, sir. Whatsapp, Viber. Facebook, email, etc. everywhere. Let everyone know, we've got a bunch of jokers in Lucknow central jail. And creating a ruckus in the name of music. The prisoners are revolting. Let everyone know. Now there's going to be a commotion. There will be an upheaval. Now, I'll call the shots and they will listen. -Hey come here. -That's our Kishan. Shit! How can someone sneak a phone inside? Security is your responsibility, right? Well, meet me at the CM's residence. -Hello, sir. -Not now, I am busy. Are you married? What? You see, I was a little surprised. Married man with children and family, having a good life. And, this is how you behave. What's it called, petty. Petty. What's your problem? Five people will turn over to a new life They'll make some achievement in life. -What do you stand to lose? -I lose my pride. Pride. It took me 15 years to make it, can't lose it so easily. Lucknow central jail is my fortress. And we look after 5000 inmates. And the ones you're supporting, are not humans. They are sheep. Criminals. That's their identity and it's going to stay that way. They still have to make an identity for themselves. -We'll see, Gayatri. We'll see. -We'll see. Let's go. It was a mistake, sir. I'll sort this out immediately. We'll take corrective measures right away. We'll ask the band members to give a statement that they are severely punished inside. And, we'll assure the victim's family that they will have maximum security inside so that they dont face any problems. That's exactly what I don't want. I don't want that. If you can't understand politics then, at least try to understand the game plan here. Do you have any idea how viral is this MMS getting? Sir, Youtube 20,000 hits. -Mobile viral spread, one million. -And counting. And the credit will go to? Me. I created that band. Everyone's saying that "The youth Minister has a modern thinking". "He's implemented progressive ideas in jail." Facebook, retweet, likes, Twitter. What is it? -Sir, trending. -Trending. And, plus I have a proposal. I'll tell Donald Trump in America that send your inmates to Uttar Pradesh. We'll reform them and send them back. Now, that's called progress. Let me get a little popular, What is your problem? Just a handful of people are criticizing me. So let them. Sit down. Come. Remember one thing. This band must win. And, lip sync won't work now. I want a mind blowing performance. It should echo from Lucknow central to all over the state. My reputation is riding on them. Don't forget this. And in exchange, give them anything they want. Make them heroes. I just don't understand why the color of your uniform and the traffic police is same. -Would you like some drinks? -Can we? Take it. Take it. Don't worry. Take it. Bottle. Sir, if we can get one of your betel leaf. Sir, 100 rupees. -What? -100 rupees. Of course, you'll get that too. Do a good job, practice hard and turn this into an awesome band. You must win this competition at any cost. Yes, sir. And, in return, you'll get anything you want. But sir. Anything, sir? Look, your case is very high profile. We cannot release you. But, you'll get anything you want. Except for freedom. Think about it. I've decided. See you, Panditji. Sir, 1821 didn't ask for anything for himself. -Smart. -Emotional. "O traveler" "O traveler" "O traveler" "O traveler" "O traveler" "O traveler" "Your destination has faded" "Yet the paths are benevolent" "O leader of the caravan" "I am following in your footsteps" "I hope there's a blessing in my fate" "O leader of the caravan" "Take me along" "Where the night dissolves Into the day again" "O leader of the caravan" "O leader of the caravan" These are Kishan's poems. The child comes home after committing a murder. Looks happy and talks to me. And sleeps peacefully. Is that possible? It's murder, not copying from chits. You feel really bad, right? There was a writer, Orson Welles. He once wrote, "No one gets justice. "All you get is good luck or bad luck." "Stop O heart, stop here" Here's all the evidence. The truth is, Gayatri, the police haven't found any evidence. Except for this eyewitness account. "A few miles together" "And then we'll separate forever" -Bindiya. -Papa. "If we flow along with the river" "The shores never meet" -Signor Chattopadhyay. -He doesn't live here anymore. He shifted to an old age home in Baliganj. "I am following in your footsteps" "I hope there's a blessing in my fate" There's a headline in the village. Pali has been released. "O leader of the caravan" My brother's have taken out the, 303 rifle. Ready to take a bullet from them too. I saw your video. It was nice. "Where the night dissolves Into the day again" I waited for you. How much I could. They got me married. I can still run away with you. I can even give up my life for you. But what about him, Pali? Go away, Veera. Go away. Go away! "O leader of the caravan" "O leader of the caravan" "O leader of the caravan" Dad. Sorry, dad. I am really sorry. I am really sorry. Tell Victor, that his father's remembering him. Father, Victor. -Look here. Victor, Victor. -Victor. Victor hasn't arrived yet. "O leader of the caravan" It's 5, Victor hasn't arrived yet. Will you please tell him? The neighbors have given him an appropriate name. Be quiet. Dikkat. -He's your brother. -Why did he have to come home? Be quiet. We have a reputation. Enough. -Dikkat. Son. -Let him go, mother. -Let him go, mother. -Son, listen to me. -Listen to me. -Let him go. What will you get from escaping, father? If you run now, you'll be running for the rest of your life. I thought you made a band. I thought you've changed. See. Your name has been printed on this. Bindiya Pandit, daughter of Shiv Purushottam Pandit. I printed this with pride. And, you're thinking about running away. Even I want to taste freedom. It's been 12 years. If a frog jumps out of a well and into the gutter, will you call that freedom? "Stop O heart, stop here" "Stop O heart, stop here" "My life is like a storm on the raging sea" "There was a house of mine, Down this path" It's whose, looming evil eyes. Which shattered my life. "The dreams of caravan" "Which got seared And disappeared" "O traveler" "Your destination has faded" "I hope there's a blessing in my fate" Everyone knows the truth about that night but no one's saying anything. IAS officer had an enmity with the local MLA, and Quiet, Bunty. Be quiet. You won't say a word. Look madam, you've permission to question him. but Bunty hasn't be ordered to answer them. That's his civil right. Maybe you don't know. Music. It's his own band. That was his dream, isn't it? I am sure you know. "The heart beats Aloud like a woofer” “One pigeon, Two pigeons, three pigeons” Think about it, Bunty. Your silence might, silence Kishan's forever. Take him inside. Greetings, Panditji. End of parole? Were you happy to see your family again? -What is this? -Sweets. -But, that will be against the rules. -Please allow one. For my brother inside. Just for him. Kishan, 1821. Panditji, I had fun. What about you? Explosive. -Mishra. -Fine. Go on. Come out, everyone. It was really fun. I met my family. My daughter. Victor, what about you? Good. Good. I took my father to Salt Lake Stadium. Took him to see a football match. We went fishing, well that's it. Great. I even saw a film. It was nice. I see. Pali. Veera got married. She left me. We all lied. There's nothing out there for us. Madam. Did you go to Moradabad? I met your father, the IAS officer's family, Bunty. Everyone. Why? I wanted to know the truth. What happened that night, Kishan? Nothing. What happened that night, Kishan? What happened that night? Why do you want to know, what happened that night? No one bothered to ask me in two years? Neither the police nor the court. I was only told. Kishan, this is what happened that night. "Kishan, you murdered a IAS officer that night. and this is your punishment!" Life imprisonment and maybe death sentence. That's the truth, madam. I am not innocent. Because the court thinks I am guilty. End of story. I am guilty. My crime was I dreamt big. How can the son of Moradabad's librarian, make a band? I recorded my own CD. And, I went to meet the biggest singer with that CD. Maybe dreams are taxable too, madam. Don't be sad for me. You won't get anything. You see, I'll never get justice. No one gets justice, Kishan. You either get good luck or bad luck. Don't worry, madam. My good luck begins now. 1821. 753. 1126. 1414 and 1759 report to the control room. Room no. five in the Admin Block has have been reserved for Lucknow central. And, the people from Agra, Varanasi, Allahabad, Naini, will stay in the other rooms. And remember, the entire Admin Block will be under the supervision of Central Police. Don't try to act smart. If you try to act smart, anything at all. You'll be shot. Now go. Doesn't matter which room we're kept in. We have the key. We'll step out in police uniforms. I'll turn the power off from the fuse box. It will take 15 seconds for the generator to turn back on. By that time we'll jump over the wall, to the other side. -Then, the main wall. -It's surrounded by electric fences. Here again I'll require the resistor. The current will turn off, game over. And, we all will go our own ways. Oh no, look. Shastri, Chaurasia. Put new locks everywhere in jail. Don't leave a single spot. Admin Block, Barrack, everywhere. New locks. We're in deep trouble. Days of hard work, gone to waste. What now, Kishan? Meal time. 20 minutes. Let's go eat. When he should be eating, he survives only on water. Now that we're in trouble, he's eating. Maybe he's in shock. Finish your meal quickly. There's going to be a scuffle. Eat. How dare you. Hey. Quite. Let go. Move. Move. -Sir, he started it. -Yes, I did. And I'll do it again and keep doing it! Leave me. Oh boy, you've grown a pair. -Maheshwari. -Sir. Put them in solitude. Keep them there, till the function. Yes, sir. Get in. Close it down. Close it down. What are you? What? All this hard work, just get thrown in solitude? I am saying something. -Stay back! back! -What a screwed up person. I knew it, I knew. I knew that the jailor would try something. But, what is this? What are you trying to do? That's why I kept another plan ready. What is this? -Are we going to escape from here? -No. Not from here. This is Block B, Window 12. It opens straight to the yard. There. Up there, we have to climb. Smart ass. -What a great idea. -Come, Panditji. Come. Hello and welcome, friends.

Friends, music, and, I am ready for any punishment. You should be punished. Sir, I told you that they are planning to escape. At least they tried. They should be punished.
