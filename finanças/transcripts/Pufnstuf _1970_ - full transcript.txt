Shh! Be quiet! Stop eating your popcorn and be quiet! That's better. Now, I'm going to make you sit there and listen, while I tell you a story that's going to tear your hearts out. It's about a gang of goody-two-shoes, just like all of you out there, and what they did to poor, sweet, adorable me. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. There he is. Can you hear him? That's the rotten kid that started it all. Let me show you what happened. And don't go away, or I'll zap you all into little frogs. Bye. If I could, I would be. A balloon. That a little kid let go. Floating through the sky. Flying free. If I could. If I could, I would be. A giraffe. With my head above the trees. So at big parades I could see. If I could. Jump on one and two and three. Rooster chase a busy bumblebee. Fire on the mountain Run and see if I'm a fool. Lady, lady, turn around. Lady, lady, tum and touch the ground. Yankee Doodle went to town and HI be late for school. Oh, school! If I could, I would be. Old and wise knowing all there is to know. Then ('d answer right every time. When they ask. If I could, I would be. A balloon. That a little kid let go. Floating through the sky. Flying free. If I could. What's going on? What's happened? It's Jimmy, Miss Flick. Jimmy did it. It's you again, is it? You little troublemaker. I'm really sorry, Miss Flick. Look at my drum, Miss Flick. He broke my drum. He kicked me. I didn't kick him. He tripped me. Honest, he did. Oh, Elroy didn't do anything, Miss Flick. Jimmy's the one. You little bully, you. I'm expelling you from the band. No, please. Don't drop me from the band, Miss Flick. My parents would really be upset. It's no wonder you were kicked out of jolly old England. I wasn't kicked out. My dad was transferred over here by his business firm. Enough of this twiddle-twaddle. You're holding us up, so scat! Scat! Now, okay, band, let's play our little hearts out. If we make good at the Saturday Elk's breakfast, it could mean the big time. And a one and a two... You sure are a lucky fella. No teachers to yell at you. No kids to make fun of the way you talk. And luckiest of all, you can't feel lonesome. Well, I won't be needing you any longer now that I'm kicked out of the band. Blimey! What's happening? Hi, Jimmy! You can talk! Oh! Careful. But... But you're just a flute. I've never heard of a flute talking. Did you ever speak to one before? No. So there. Easy now. Ah, that's better. Terrific! And you were wrong about flutes. We can be lonesome, too. Will you be my friend? Will I? Oh, boy! By the way, do you have a name? Of course. It's Freddy. Freddy Flute. That's a knockout! Then what are we waiting for, pal? Let's go have some fun. You bet. I've found a friend in you. One that surely will endure. Loneliness has just one cure. The friend I've found in you. You've found a friend in me. One on whom you can depend. True and trusting till the end. The friend you've found in me. Isn't it good to feel. Isn't it nice to know. That from here to wherever we go. We'll never, never be lonely. Never. Never be lonely. Never be lonely. Never be lonely I've found a friend in you. One that surely will endure. Loneliness has just one cure. The friend I've found in you. Freddy, look, down in the bay. Yoo-hoo! Hi, Jimmy. Hi, Freddy. Freddy, that boat spoke to us. Well, let's not be unfriendly. Of course not. Some of my best friends are boats. Let's go have a chat with him. Hi, Mr. Boat. Let's go for a ride, boys. Full speed ahead. Hey, Freddy, how about this? Wee! Isn't this fun, Jimmy? It beats the knickers off band practice. Thanks a lot, Mr. Boat. It's my pleasure, kiddies. Hang on. Can you picture Miss Flick if she saw us now? I bet she'd flip her wig. Gee, maybe we ought to turn back. What was that? Just thunder, I hope. I think I want to go home. It looks like a broom! And someone's on it. It's the only way to fly! Oh, I'm frightened. Oh! Hey, Mr. Boat, let's get out of here! There they are. Your fiendish little plan is working perfectly. You bet your bent beak, it is! That gorgeous golden flute will make me the talk of all witchdom, and it will soon be mine. Oh, pretty boat, change your track! You're now in my power, all evil and black! What happened to our nice, friendly boat? I don't know. And where is he taking us? You did it, chief y. Nice work. It was rather flashy, wasn't it? Geuseuuey. And now for the finishing touch. Oh, evil boat, be a peach. Bring the prisoners to my castle beach! It's got me! Something's got me! Help! Oh' my-Help! Let me go. Get off! Help! Help! Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. That terrible witch is at it again. Cling and Clang, bring the Rescue Racer on the double. Let's get out of here! Curses! That boat let him get away! Drat! It's Pufnstuf! Why doesn't that lumpy dragon mind his own business? It's your fault! What did I do? He looks awful. I wonder who he is. Where am I? You're on Living Island, son. And I'm the Mayor, H.R. Pufnstuf. And these two little fellas are Cling and Clang. Pleased to meet you. And I'd like to thank you for saving us. Freddy, are you all right? Oh, thanks, Jimmy. Now I feel a lot better. Gee willikers! A solid gold talking flute with a diamond skin condition. I bet you're what the witch is after. The witch? You mean that old wet bag up on that broom is a real witch? I'm afraid so. And we'd better get to a safe place before she comes back on her... Oh, it's too late. Here she comes! Save me, Jimmy. Save me! Don't worry, Freddy. I won't let her get you. Quick. Let's get out of here. Hurry, boys, hurry. Let's go. Look at them run. Well, you won't get away this time, my little darling. Aren't we going to fight back? We sure are. Cling, let her have it. Witchiepoo, they're firing at us. Ping-pong balls? They've got to be kidding. Witchie, speak up. I can't hear you. You're talking with your mouth full. Oh, my. Don't worry. I'll save you. So they want to fight dirty, eh? Well, I'll show them. Hang on to your feathers. Look out! Here she comes. Faster, Clang. Evil spirits, knock and sock, make them wind up on a rock. Oh, my goodness! Willikers! We're stuck. Give it the gas, Clang. Now I've got those little rascals right where I want them. That golden flute is mine. Let's start pushing. Hurry, hurry. Come on. Oh, it looks like we've had it, boys. We can't give up. Come on, let's pull. Pull. Harder! Ah, it's no fun when it's this easy. They're mine, all... What's happened to the Vroom Broom? We're out of gas! Heavens! I forgot to fill it up. You blundering buzzard! They must've run out of gas. The witch is headed back to her castle. You can come out now, Freddy. The witch is gone. Are you sure, Jimmy? Gosh, I was scared. You weren't the only one. Blimey! All clear. Witch alarm is over. Witch alarm is over. All clear, all clear. That alarm clock, it talks. Amazing. Of course. Everything around here talks. That's why we call this Living Island. Terrific! Oh, man, I'm glad that witch cut out. That was a bad seed, like, a real bummer. Blimey! How about that, Freddy? A hippie tree! Ooh, you're British. How divine. My ancestors were British. They came over on the Mayflower. Tell it like it is, baby. Your ancestors were the Mayflower. What an amazing place. Come with me, boys. Living Island is a most amazing place. Islands are serene but this one's not the case. Go man, go! With a hippie tree for peace and love. A rich, rich watch with time to spare.

If Boss Witch ever finds out I blew a chance to nab that talking flute, Pllneverrnake VVHch ofthe'YeaL Nevefl. Witchiepoo. Witchiepoo. Message for Witchiepoo. Oh, leaping Lucifer! The Vroom Broom is down. It ran out of gas. You don't say. Who do you think was flying it, you Stupid Bat? Get a can of gas and go refuel it. I'm pooped. Call the Auto Club. Move! I'm off. I'm beginning to like this. Witchiepoo, quick. What is it, Seymour? I picked up the good guys on the image machine. Let's see what those goody-two-shoes are up to. Look at that. Pufnstuf is taking that brat, Jimmy, and my flute into his cave. Well, nothing can stop me. I'm going to get that flute, or my name isn't Wilhelmina W. Witchiepoo. What's the "W" stand for? The "W" stands for "whack"! I hate to be a spoilsport, O glorious queen, but you know your evil magic doesn't work inside Pufnstuf's cave. Yeah. So how're you gonna get in to grab the flute? By using my brain. That's why I'm a glorious queen and you're a dumb, dumb spider. I'm going to get in that cave, as sure as I'm a witch. So stand back, while I do a switch. Hi, there. I'm Betsy Bugaloo. Who aloo? Bugaloo. I am from the Bugaloo Dance Studios, and I'm here to give you some lessons. Dig? Witchiepoo! Wow, chief y, you're cute. Well, I've got to go dancing with the dragon. Watch the store. There. How does that fit, son? Terrific. Thanks, Puf. Oh, Jimmy. Maybe that's the witch. Oh, no. This cave is witchproof. The only way that old hag can get in is if I let her in. And I'm sure not dumb enough to do that. I'm coming. I'm coming. Hi, there. I'm Betsy Bugaloo. Let it all hang out. Yeah! Willikers! You must have the wrong cave, blonde lady, person, ma'am. Congratulations! That's the correct answer. You've just won yourself a free dancing lesson. Absolutely free. Really, ma'am, I don't want any dancing lessons. Oh! Oh, my! Come on, twinkle toes. Light my fire. All righty. I'm ready for my next pupil. Let's jive, Clive. She's a wild one. What have we here? Say, aren't you cute. I've never been on a toot with a flute. Please, put me down. Let it all hang out, Freddy. Go, Freddy. No, stop. I can't dance. Uh, Miss Bugaloo. Why is she dancing outside? There's plenty of room in here. Miss Bugaloo. Ma'am! Miss Bugaloo! Where are you going? Oh, stop. Put me down. You'd better come back here, ma'am. It's dangerous to be out there. The witch might get you. The witch? Who do you think I am? Little Orphan Annie? Come on, flutie. We're off. Bye! Good grief! It was the witch. And she's got Freddy! Give him back! Give me Freddy back, I tell you! Let me go. Help! - Jimmy, save me! - Let Freddy go! Come back here, you old witch! Stop! I order you to stop! Help! Help! Stop! Come back! Wave bye-bye to everybody. Let Freddy go! Stop! I order you! Don't give up, Freddy. I'll save you! No, Jimmy. Come back, Jimmy. Jimmy, save me! Save me! Forget him, sweetie. From now on, it's gonna be just you and me. Witchiepoo and Flutiepoo. No, Jimmy, stop. Wait... I can't wait. Who knows what that evil old bag is doing to poor Freddy. We've got to go after him. Now, now, boy, I know how upset you are. I promised Freddy I'd take care of him, and look what's happened. Please, Puf, we've got to do something before it's too late. Please! We need all the help we can get. We'd better go see Dr. Blinky. Dr. Blinky? So that's what happened. The witch has got Freddy. Who? Freddy. Who? You know, Freddy Flute. My Pal. My buddy. I know that! But I'm an owl, and that's what we owl's say. "Who? Who?" See what I mean? Please, Dr. Blinky. We have to hurry. Freddy's so tiny. He can't stand much torture. Oh, my. This is a real tough one. We have to figure a way to sneak into the witch's castle. Are you thinking, staff? We're thinking. We're thinking. But, Dr. Blinky! Oh, relax, Jimmy. For heaven's sake, Sooty, will you stop smoking? Now, Doc, I can't help it, see. I'm thinking, too, see. And when I'm thinking, I always smoke a lot, see. Well, control yourself. People will think the house is on fire. Hang on a minute. What is it? Well, we want to get into the castle, right? Right. Well, what if the witch thought her castle was on fire? What would she do? Why, she'd send for the fire department. Willikers! And I'm the island fire chief. So you could make us firemen. And we can all rush into the castle and rescue Freddy. Brilliant, my boy. Brilliant. That's using your head. A phony fire. Great. And I can loan you all the smoke you need. Terrific. Well, what are we waiting for? Everybody grab a bag and start filling it. S ooty, p u ff away. Now, our only problem is how to sneak the smoke into the witch's castle. No, there must be some way. Oh, my! Googy Gopher! Hey, what are you guys doing in my house? This happens to be my house! Huh? Oh, shucks! I must've taken the wrong off-ramp. Pardon my dirt. Bye. No, Googy, wait. He can do it. What? What? I can do what? You can tunnel your way into the cellar of the castle. And deliver the smoke. Brilliant, brilliant! Quick. Let's fill up these bags. P u ff away, S ooty. Wait a minute. What castle? What smoke? What brilliant? Please, come up out of there, and I'll tell you what it's all about. You've got to help us. Hurry, fireplace. We need a castle full of smoke to go. Coming up. Oh, you're too good to be true, you little dickens. I can't believe you're mine, all mine. I'm not yours. I want to go home. Oh, you're so cute when you're mad. It makes your little diamond hickies light up. Kichie-kitchie-goo-goo. Kichie-kitchie-goo-goo, yourself! Well, don't just stand there, noodle-nose. Answer the phone. Coming. Coming.

And when I do my act with him at the witches' convention, I'm bound to stop the show. Honey, you couldn't stop the show with power brakes. But wait till they hear me sing my new song. La, la, la La, la, la, la. Yuck! Eat your heart out, kid. But my flute is bound to make me Witch of the Year. Let's cut out all of this twaddle. Do you want to hear the latest dirt? Oh, do u Dish!

No, I can't see the smoke because there isn't any smoke. Holy smoke. No smoke. And there isn't any fire, so beat it! Googy should have dug his way in by now. What could have happened to him? Fire! Fire! Fire! Googy! What are you doing here? Darling, you're supposed to be in the castle. Whoops! The clock house. Oh, shucks! Made the wrong turn again. Bye. Crazy, mixed-up gopher. Fire! Fire! Fire! I'm the fire chief! Fire! I'm warning you sickies for the last time. Scram, or I'll zap you all into centipedes with bad feet! - Fire! - Fire! All right, you dumb-dumbs. If it's fire you want, fire you'll get. - Run for it! - Let's get out of here! Hurry! Ooh! That old crow sure socked it to us. We better get outta here, fast. No. Maybe Googy'll still make it. He's just got to, or Freddy's a goner. Let's watch for a sign of smoke. Hey, bub, is this the witch's castle? It ain't Disneyland. Hooray! I finally made it. Fire! Fire! What? Fire! What's all this smoke? Galloping goonies! Look, the castle's on fire! Fire? Help! Fire! Fire! Fire! Hey, skinny, you better get out of here before it's too late. Fire in the castle! Fire!

Pufnstuf. Make way for the mail! Letter for Judy Frog! Make way for the mail! Make way for the mail! What a landing. Orville, you're interrupting a very important meeting. Now, just a darn minute, Mayor. Neither sleet, nor snow, nor witch, will stay this worthy courier from his appointed rounds. Wait a minute. Say that again. The part about the sleet and the snow. Neither sleet, nor snow, nor witch, will stay this worthy courier... That's it. Orville's the answer. The answer to what? Yeah. To what? You're going to smuggle Jimmy and Freddy off the island. Me? Smuggle? How? Where? Yes, how? And where? Any questions? Bye! Goodbye, everybody. Thanks for everything. We're really gonna miss you. You all set in there, Jimmy? It's a bit crowded in here. Hey, that's my lunch! Sorry. Yeah. Let's watch it in there. All right, everybody. Stand back. It's time to take off. Clear the runway. Goodbye, boys. Happy landings. Bye! If it gets rough up there, you can hang onto my tongue. Switch on. Contact. Off we go. Faster. Full speed. Up, Orville, up. We're not gonna make it! Jimmy, what happened? It was terrible. Is Orville okay? Are you all right, Orville? I wonder if The Red Baron started this way. Just look at this mess. My castle's wrecked. My wands are busted. I lost my flute. What did I ever do to deserve all this? I've tried to be a good witch. I work hard at my spells. I do a rotten turn every day. It's the hotline! Boss Witch is calling! Do you think she heard about your losing the flute? If she did, I'm ruined. Out of my way! I'm coming, Your Majesty. I'm coming. Forgot it was the hotline. Oh, the old bat. What she calling at this hour of the day for? Oh, rats. Oh, I'm a nervous wreck. Oh, I'm broken out all over. Oh, I'll kill her. Hello? It took you long enough to answer, you old biddy. Oh, forgive me, Your Royal Rottenness, queen of all that's evil. I was down in the dungeon. Putting the screws to some goody-goody, I hope. Well, no... I mean, yes, yes. My torture racks are jammed with good guys. Just listen, you can hear them suffering. Forget it. They're a little off-key, but... But that ought to convince you, I'm not holding any weenie bake. Pm glad you've got everything under control. I'm switching the witches' convention to your castle. Here! You know, you could make Witch of the Year. Especially with that talking flute I heard about on the witchvine. I can hardly wait to see it. Me, too. I mean, oh, yes, yes. I don't blame you for wanting to see that flute. It's a real gas. But, Witchiepoo, you forgot. You don't have the... Well, Poo, I'll see you and the flute at the convention. Until then, keep rotten. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Please, Witchiepoo. Calm down. "Calm down," he says. The commander-in-chief of all witchdom is bringing our convention here, and she wants to see my flute, and I don't have my flute, and he says, "calm down"! Why'd you say it, Orson? Move, you dummies! Get this joint cleaned up! Orson, get my super wand and our bombs and come with me. I'm gonna get that flute, or blast those good guys into oblivion. Move! Move! Now, easy does it, Orville. We'll have you good as new. Nice try, Mr. Pelican. But I think we should forget the whole idea. Yes. But thanks, anyway. Don't be silly, boys. You're forgetting, neither sleet, nor snow, nor witch can stop... Oh, no. You shouldn't have said "witch." Here she comes. Take cover. It's too late! Hit the ground! That's just a sample. Ll you don't surrender and hand over that flute, I'll blast you all into bits! She means business. She's really gonna clobber us. We're goners. Maybe you better give me up. Not on your life, Freddy. Come on, everybody. Let's run for my cave. So that's the way you want it, Okay. Then it's war! Bombs away! Make way for the mail! Make way for the mail! Quick, everybody, let's go to my cave. Hurry. Hurry. Quick, everybody. Into the cave, fast, before she comes back. Hurry. She's gone off her rocker. She's gonna destroy the whole island. Willikers! Maybe the West Wind can help us. Hello up there, West Wind. This is your mayor talking. We need help. Help! You mean, you know the West Wind? Of course. Help! Oh, thank heavens. There he is. Hi, West Wind. Howdy, partner. I'll be glad to help you. Blimey! I don't believe it. Please, West Wind, you've got to stop the witch. Relax, partners, I'll just head her off at the pass. Witchiepoo, look, it's the West Wind. Drat! Everybody wants to get into the act. Come on, West Wind, let her have it. Blow, West Wind, blow. Oh, my. Harder, Westy, harder. Witchiepoo, where are you? They broke my Vroom Broom. What happened, chief y? What happened? You run out of gas again? Shut up, you dummy, and give me a hand. Help me up. Oh, boy. Now, how are you gonna grab that flute? Questions. Questions. When are you gonna start coming up with some answers? Get in there and get on that image machine! Storm warning. Watch out for the West Wind. Storm warning... How do you get out of this chicken outfit? Look at the village. What a mess. We're really lucky nobody was hurt. Oh, it's the worst shape we've ever been in. We'd better hold an emergency disaster meeting. Right. Back in the cave, folks. Let's go, everybody. Jimmy. Freddy. Hurry. Hurry. Come on. Come on, Jimmy, they're all inside. We're not going in, Freddy. Why not? What's wrong? We've endangered the lives of our friends long enough. If we go away, maybe the witch will leave them alone. But aren't we even going to tell them we're going? If we did, they'd never let us. We'll just have to find a way off the island by ourselves. I guess you're right, Jimmy. It's the only fair thing to do. Good boy. And we'd better hurry before they miss us. Order. Order! Now, we've got to do something about that witch. That's good. There's no one following us. I sure hope the witch didn't see us go. Just keep your fingers crossed. Oops. Sorry. I'll keep my fingers crossed. You do the best you can. Hang on. Roses are red, violets are blue, look who's here. Witchiepoo. Get lost, buster! Scat! Go lay an egg! I've heard about the birds and the bees, but this is ridiculous. A flower just isn't safe around here. Oh, as soon as they come out, I'm gonna zap it to them. Order. You all had some very good ideas. But I think we should also hear what Jimmy has to say. Yes. Yes. Good idea. Speak up, Jimmy. Where is he? Jimmy? Where are you? - Jimmy? Where is... - He's not here. Come to think of it, I haven't seen him since the meeting started. Then he still must be outside. Willikers! I hope nothing's wrong. Come on, let's hurry. Beautiful. Here they come. Jimmy. Jimmy? Jimmy. Right into my trap. Wheeze, breeze, I order you to freeze! All right, where's my little golden darling? Freddy! Where are you, Freddy? Jimmy? Jimmy? What happened to Jimmy and Freddy? What happened to Jimmy and Freddy? Where's my flute? Speak, you lump of lard. Speak! We don't know where Jimmy and Freddy are. They're missing. That's why we came out to look for them. You're lying. You know where they are. You're hiding them. I'll take the whole kit and caboodle of you back to my castle and torture it out of you. Wink, pink, the kitchen sink. I order all of you to shrink! Gosh, it's scary. Do we have to go through here? It's the only way to the other side of the island. Maybe we can find a boat or something to help us escape. Jimmy, look out! Caught you! Grab him. Take him to the witch. Help! Help! All right. I got him. I got him. Grab the flute! Hold him! Let go! Hold on to him! Hold him! Run! Oh, he kicked me in the root. Oh, you goofballs, better call the witch, fast. Roger wilco, Evil Trees. I'll deliver your report as soon as Her Royal Rottenness gets back. Over and out. Oh, noble queen, I have an important message for you. Don't bother me, you gabby goose. I'm in a snit. That brat, Jimmy, and the flute gave me the slip. Well, that's what I wanted to tell you... I have no time for idle chitchat. Oh, I'm gonna make that Pufnstuf and his gang tell me where that kid is hiding if I have to tear them limb from limb! I don't mean to be personal, chief y, but you got squeaky dandruff. Youdhnwfi. Those are Jimmy's squeaky friends. Witchiepoo, you must listen to me. Stop that dancing up there. If you mess up my hairdo, I'll have your hides. You did the shrinking bit. Oh, goodie. Let me see the little creeps. Let me see them. Chief, I beg of you. There's something I simply must tell you. Will you two clucks stand back? I've got some third-degreeing to do. Okay, everybody out! All right, you little bugs. If you don't want to get stepped on and squashed... Ha! You had better tell me where Jimmy and Freddy are. Make us big again. But I know, chief y. Jimmy and Freddy just passed through the Evil Forest. They did? How do you know? Who told you? The Evil Trees just reported in. The kid and the flute are heading for the other side of the island. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Well, you didn't try hard enough, number two. This is murder, chief. They're escaping. Quick! We'd better go after them. Let's go. I'll rev up the Vroom Broom. Hold it, you bubbleheads, hold it! Witchie, you mean you're going to let them escape? Of course not. But why should we waste all this energy running around, when we've got to get ready for the convention? We'll let the little rascals come to us. As Mayor, I demand you let us go. Oh, shut up! I've had enough of you and your small talk. Guards! Bring these mini morons into the dungeon. Wait a minute! They're so tiny, they might be able to sneak between the bars. Fee-fi-to-fum, I order you to grow up! Well, that's better, madam. Now, we'll be on our way. You've got to be kidding. Guards, to the dungeon. Take them away! Move them out! Get them out of here! And now for my brilliant scheme. Stupid Bat, front and center. On the double! Stupid Bat reporting for duty. Come here. I've got a secret mission for you, so listen closely, because I don't want any boo-boo's. Look, Freddy. It's the witch's ship. We can pinch it and sail home. Come on, Jimmy, let's hurry. I want to get away from here. Hey, down there. Hello, there. It's one of the witch's gang. Hey, you guys, I got something for you. "Hear ye, hear ye. "Pufnstuf and all the good guys have been taken prisoner by the witch. "All those who want to save them had better hurry." Oh, Jimmy, do you think they're still alive? "P.S. Yes, they're still alive, but not for long. Signed, the witch." That is all. Over and out. Bye. Oh, what are we gonna do? We don't have any choice. Our friends are in trouble. We'd better go back and try and save them. I'm with you. Let's go. Hurry! What a terrible place. Things don't look too good. Incarcerated. I'm scared. I'm scared. Witchiepoo, I'm getting worried. What if Jimmy and the flute don't come back? Well, stop worrying. They'll show up. The good guys are coming! Jimmy and Freddy are on their way back. What did I tell you? I knew they were coming back. And when they do, whammo! They'll walk right into the hands of my guards. Right now, I'm as good as tooting my own flute. And you're as good as Witch of the Year. Yes. All I need to cinch it is to cook up a fabulous banquet. Now, what exotic little delicacy can I serve? Let's see... This looks yummy. Bat wings au gratin. Oh, no! Witchiepoo, not me. I'd make a rotten au gratin! Witch Hazel served that last year. Besides, I've got to impress Boss Witch with something really original. Thank goodness. At least Jimmy and Freddy got away. Oh! I just hope they don't come back and try to rescue us. We've got to do something before they try anything. I demand you release us at once! This is your mayor talking, you old witch! Let us out! You can't keep us prisoners! Let us out... I can't take think with that racket going on! Shut up down there, you pot-bellied iguana! Ooh, that Pufnstuf, I ought to feed him to the sharks! He's... He's... He's my blue plate special! What are you talking about, chief y? I just planned my din-din. Now, just a darn minute. When you said you wanted me for dinner, you didn't say I was gonna be the dinner! Save a drumstick for me, O gorgeous leader. Me too, chief y. Yum-yum! I hope you don't take too long to barbeque, chubby, my guests will be here in a few hours. You can't cook me. I'm the Mayor. I'm out of season. I'll give you heartburn. I'm thinking. Something's missing. You won't get away with this. I know! It's an outrage. Now, see here, madam, I want... Yes, sir! Now you're finger-licking good. Spin for the Colonel. Hello! Is anybody here? Hello! Answer us! Somebody! Please! Somebody! Anybody! It's a worse catastrophe than I thought. It looks like the witch captured everybody. Oh, Jimmy, this is horrible. What are we gonna do? We'll have to break into the castle some way and... Slow down, you square rat. Ja, my leader. Do you have to go so fast? No, my leader. Watch that bright cloud. I'm watching. You stupid. Jawoll, stupid. Look at that golden broom. It must be the Boss Witch. Hey, look. Blimey! All the witches must be coming here for their convention. It's hopeless. There's no way we can get through now. Pufnstuf is doomed. Yes. And Doc Blinky, and Judy, Cling and Clang. Everybody! Right. Unless you're a witch, you couldn't get within a mile of that castle. It's all because of us. If we hadn't have... Wait a minute! Maybe that's how I can get into the castle. I can disguise myself as a witch. You? A witch? You'd never get away with it. Why not? They're having a convention. Look at all those witches arriving. Who would even notice one more old hag? It's crazy! It's insane! It's our only chance! Hurry up, you little weirdos, they'll be here soon. Get that throne dusted off, Seymour. Let's move this snack table over here. Be careful, Stupid. I'm careful. I'm careful. Oh, I'm so beautiful, so gorgeous and so divine, I'm mine, all mine. Seymour, get the broom! I broke another one. The witches are here. They're early. They got here early. Jimmy and Freddy. Any sign of them? Not a sign of them, chief y. I'm dead without that flute. What's keeping those little brats? Maybe they forgot our address. Forgot our address? I've got to get that flute fast. Go out and find them. Take the back way. Move! They would get here early, those miserable, moth-eaten... Dear girls, so good to see you. Come in, my girls. Make yourself at home. My castle is your castle. Please try the toasted lizards. They're delicious. Well, look who's here. Witchiepoo, darling. Witch Hazel, my precious. You look different. Well, I do have a new rat in my hair. No, that's not it. I know! You had a wart job. I just had them rearranged a bit. You should try it. I will, dearie, when I get to be your age. You were my age. Twice, already. Bless your round, little body. How do you like my new ring? Three carrots. Love them. The Boss Witch! Boss Witch is here! Hurry, girls! Line up! Achtung! Make way for Her Abominable Majesty, queen of all evil, Boss Witch. Everybody bow. Bow, I said. You, too, shrimpy. Is this the way you greet your queen, you freaked-out fru m p? I tripped. Have mercy on me, O Queen, exalted ruler of witchdom, imperial empress. All right, let's not get sickening about it. On your feet, you sniveling ninny. You must obey orders! I'm up. I'm LIP- Hail, you happy harpies. Hail, nUmero uno. Hail, nUmero uno. Your Majesty, may I officially bid you welcome to my humble little castle and offer you... You touched me. You touched the royal body. What's so funny, you creepy crone? I'll do the swatting around here. I deserved that, Your Highness. After all, you're the boss. Mother witch of them all. All right. All right. All right. All right! Your Majesty, I've just got to show you what I'm cooking for dinner. Come. Didn't touch, didn't touch. Geuseuuey. Come, My Queenship. Come, girls. Feast your royal eyes, my queen. Doesn't that make your majestic mouth drool? - Barbequed dragon? - Mmm-hmm. I had it for lunch. You did? Me, too. Dragon Delight. They deliver. Well, well, well, well... I'll whip up something else. Forget the food. I want to see this fabulous talking flute you've been bragging about. Now, trot him out. Flute? Trot him out? You will trot him out, schnell! Oh, well, yes. I mean, no. Well, I can't show him to you right now, My Queenship. He's, uh... Oh! He's taking a nap. The flute takes naps? Oh, yes, my empress. He's a skinny little fellow. And every day at this time, it's jammies and night-night. Well, he'll be up in time for the show. "Jammies and night-night"? I may be ill. Enough of this nonsense. Hymie! JawoH! Call the convention to order. The convention is about to begin. You will take your places. Schnefl! Seymour. Seymour. Any word on the flute? No, chief y. Let me know the instant my guards grab him. Right. Will do. Somebody up there hates me. Out of my way, you dummies! My broom broke down. I'm late for the convention. We're inside the castle, Freddy, so be very quiet. Hurry, we've got to find the dungeon. Hey, lady, you're late. You better hurry and get in there fast. The meeting's just starting. It's right this way. Come on. Come on. Let go, you feathered freak. I'll be in there in a minute. I have to go and... You can powder your nose later, madam. Better get in there now. Boss Witch is in a terrible mood. You're late, you clumsy old bag! The flute. Any sign of Jimmy or the flute? No, chief. I was just going out to check. Well, go. Go! I have to go, too. I just remembered I left my broom double-parked. Wait a minute. Youtmkfunny. I don't remember you. Who are you? Get your hands off me, old poop! I happen to be a foreign delegate from the British territory. What's your name? The name is Witch Beatle. Witch Beatle. My! I'm honored. A foreign delegate in my castle. All right, knock off the chatter over there, you old bag, and let's start the meeting, hmm? Coming, Your Majesty. Coming. Come on, Beatle doll, you can sit with me. We will have silence. Take your seats, Dummkopfs, or you'll be blown to bits. All right. All right. All right. I hereby declare this convention is now in session. Haven't we met? She's my guest. All right. Now, let's get started. Witchiepoo. Read the minutes of our last meeting. And for Satan's sake, skip the dull part, hmm? Read, schnell! "The last convention was opened, as usual, with our pledge and our cheer. "Then Weird Wanda showed her home movies of her volleyball game with the vampires." We really made suckers out of them, didn't we, girls? "After the movies, Witch Way gave the financial report." That's me. Sit down, donkey. All right, already. Enough of that hogwash. But I haven't finished, Your Highness. Oh, no? Well, I'd say the minutes are all over with now, huh? Everybody to the bar. It's happy hour now. Come, Beatle, honey. Witches. Witches. Drink up, you happy harpies. Hemlock for everyone. Chugalug! It's me, Puf. Jimmy. Hang on. I'll try to figure something out. All right, you hags. Let's get the show on the road. It's show time. And that includes you, Witch Beatle. Get away from that food. I'm ready I'm ready. But, Your Magnificent Majesty, the girls haven't finished their drinky-poos. Can't we postpone the entertainment for a while? What for? Let's go, Poo. Go! Scooby-Doo. Oh, shut up! Please, Your Bosship, can't we wait? Pretty please, huh? Will you stop the sobbing, please? That's worse than touching. I said the entertainment starts now. And I want you and that flute of yours to open the show. You know something? I'm beginning to wonder if there is a flute. Have you seen it? I already said that. Of course, there's a flute, my queen. But, uh... Freddy and I have to go on last. Nothing can follow our act. Right. We'd have to spray the place. I'm ready to go on, You r Royal Rotten ness. Well, just don't stand there, you dumb-dumbs. Let's get the show on the road. Come on! Jawoll. I will start the music. Play, Heinrich. Yeah. Groovy. When I was smaller and people were taller I realized that I was different. I had a power that set me apart. I learned to take it, to use it, to make it. It's not so bad to be different, to do your own thing. And do it with heart. Different is hard Different is lonely. Different is trouble for you only. Different is heartache Different is pain. But I'd rather be different than be the same. At first I'd wonder what hex I was under. What did I do to be so different? Then I discovered some others like me. Wonder no longer Together, we're stronger. It's not so bad to be different. Be true to yourself. That's what you must be. Different is hard Different is lonely. Different is trouble for you only. Different is heartache Different is pain. But I'd rather be different than be the same. Different is hard Different is lonely. Different is trouble for you only. Different is heartache Different is pain. But I'd rather be different than be the same that was nothing. Come on, Beatle, honey. Show them some real entertain ment. You clumsy clod, you've ripped my shawl! My flute! That's my talking flute! What are you doing with my flute, you rotten limey hag? Let go of him, you baggage! He's not yours, he's mine! Stop that squabbling. Stop it, I say! Hand him over, you flute-grabber. He's mine, you hussy! She's wearing a wig. I thought she had brown roots. So you're the foreign delegate, eh? I got you, my precious. Give him back! Stop. Stop it this instant. What is this all about? And who are you? I'll show you who he is. It's a falsey. Meet one of the good guys. That's that brat, Jimmy. Imagine him trying to steal my flute. Guards, away with him! To the dungeon! No! Stop! Wait! Let Freddy and Pufnstuf go! Let us go, you old hag! Hush your little holes. That's no way to talk to your mommy, honeykins. Let Freddy go! Get that brat out of here! Out! Out! Stop! No! Let us go! Jimmy! You leave Freddy alone! I'll get you for this! Help, Jimmy! Save me! Save me... Feast your eyes, girls. Isn't he precious? You've seen one flute, you've seen them all. Cool it! Give me that. Wow! Get a load of those diamonds. It's not only adorable, but this kid's worth a fortune. But he's not for sale. Can I have him back? He wants his mommy. Poo old dear, let's you and me have a little chat, huh? All right. Carry on with the happy hour, girls. Eat, drink, and be rotten! Let's go, cutie. Ja, we drink. You tried, lad. That's all anybody could ask. You should've seen poor Freddy clutched in the old hag's claw. And Pufnstuf roasting on that spit. With an apple in his mouth. And we're probably next. Oh, there's no way out of this dungeon. It would take a miracle to save us. What the... What is that? Oh, my! Oops! Sorry, folks. I guess I blew it again. Bye. No! Wait, Googy. Here he is, our miracle. Oh, Googy saved us. What do you mean? I have? YourtunneL You got in, so that means we can get out. That's right. Right. We don't want the guards to hear us. Hurry. Maybe we still have a chance to save Freddy and Puf. Lead the way, Googy. Follow me. Oh, come on. Quickly. Who's gonna go first here? Oh, boy. Hurry up, please. Then it's a deal? It's a deal. Marvelous. Marvelous. I'm Freddy's new mother. And you're the new Witch of the Year. Thank you, Your Majesty. Oh, I'm so thrilled! Oops! I'm sorry. I almost touched yourroyalbody. Go ahead. Touch.Touch. Live a little. Please, let me go. Quiet, booby. And remember, be a good boy, or those friends of yours down in the dungeon... Nice work, everybody. We made it. Oh, goodness gracious. Welcome back, gang. It's good to see you alive. But where are Freddy and Pufnstuf? They're still prisoners, and we've got to do something fast. Yes. Those hags are going to fricassee our poor Mayor. Let's take some sticks and rocks and things and march on the castle. Yes. Yes. No, no, sticks and rocks won't be any help against those evil hags. Why not? Why not? Hold it. Hold it, everybody. We've been studying up. We found out what scares witches. Tell us. Tell us. Look on my page 87, under "Halloween tips." Hurry. Read, read. Come on, hurry. Page 87. 87.87. Right. Right there. There. Read. "Halloween tips. How to scare a witch. "There is nothing in the entire world that can scare a witch except..." Except? Except what? Read. Read. "An angel or a good fairy." Good fairy? "If a witch catches even a glimpse of an angel or good fairy, "they get real uptight and run for miles to get away from them." But what good is all that? There aren't any angels or good fairies around here. At least I don't think so. We know that. But the witches don't. You mean, make Googy an angel? Gosh! I usually go in the opposite direction. Not just Googy. I mean all of us. If one angel can scare a witch, a bunch of them should cause a riot. What do you say? It's our only chance to save Freddy and Puf. Then I say, let's try it. Come on, fellow angels. We'll need lots of costumes and makeup and flying stuff. So, let's hurry. Yeah! Yeah! I'd volunteer to be an angel too, but I know I'd flunk the physical. And now for the high point of our convention, the selection of the Witch of the Year. The envelope, please. Jawoll, my leader. One envelope coming up. The winner is from Living Island, Wilhelmina W. Witchiepoo. That's me! I hereby pronounce you Witch of the Year. This is the happiest moment of my life. Me, Witch of the Year. It's a dream come true. It's a frame-up. I protest. Foul! Foul! Of course it's a frame-up, you broken down old bag. You ever hear of a witch being fair? I'm so happy, I could zap the world! Come on, girls, let's do it! Wee. Come on. Nice work, my little cherubs. Now, you all know what to do, so into the castle. And bless you. I have a potion to cause a commotion. You mix some garlic with kasha and glue. You dab it on your elbow and arm and zap! It makes a toad out of you. Zap the world Zap the world. Come together Get together. Together we can zap the world. Zap the world Zap the world. Come together Get together. Together, we can zap, zap, zap, zap, zap. Zap the world. You're all so rotten and I haven't forgotten. I get so wicked just watching you work. Pm grateful to that voodoo guru. That zap, zap, zap a bunch of weirdoes like you. Zap the world Zap the world. Come together Get together. Together, we can zap the world. Zap the world Zap the world. Come together Get together. Together, we can zap, zap, zap, zap, zap. Zap the world. It's an angel raid! Is this another of your rotten jokes? Does this look like a joke? Yikes! Hit the deck! It's angel's dust. Don't let it touch you. It'll turn us into good fairies! Angel at three o'clock! It's an epidemic! Why didn't you have the castle angel-proofed, you idiot? Give me that. Oh, yeah? Give me back my Freddy! Help! Let me go! Freddy! He's with the angels now. Freddy! Freddy, are you all right, Freddy? I'm fine now, Jimmy. Who said conventions were fun? Duck! Here comes another one! I'll never touch another drop. Where did I park my broom? Out of the way. Make way for your leader. Let me go! It's my door, I get to use it first! Oh, no, you've had it. Turn in your key to the broom closet. You're through! Through! Take care of him, Dr. Blinky. I'm gonna go get Puf. - Be careful, boy. - Wait! Don't leave me! Oh, go to heaven! Stop! Please, I beg of you! Hang on, Puf, I'll let you loose. I promise I'll never zap the good guys again. I'll be like a mother to them. Good grief! The wires are tangled! We lost our angels. Wires! More falseys! You aren't angels. It's a hoax! It's a trick! Come back, Boss Witch! They're a fake! They aren't angels! Gosh. Thanks, Jimmy. I sure thought I was a goner. Come on. Let's run for it. Yeah. We better get out of here. Come on. Come on. Come on. They weren't really angels! It was the good guys! Please, my leader. Where did I go wrong? Where? Fire! Fire! Shh. We've already done that. Come back, Boss Witch. Come back! Come on, Orson! To the broom room! We've got to catch Boss Witch! Yes, my queen. Boy, we certainly scared the daylights out of those old hags. You really made terrific angels. You all were knockouts. I never was so frightened in all my life. Oh, my! Me, either. I'll never look at another apple as long as I live. Look! There goes Witchiepoo! Boss Witch, wait for me! Boss Witch, come back! If she catches up with Boss Witch, she'll bring them back, and we'll all be goners. Look, Witchiepoo, there are the good guys. I'll fix them! Get out my doomsday bomb! One bomb coming up. I'll throw that little darling myself. Orson, take the wheel. Right, chief. You idiot! When I said, "take the wheel," I didn't mean "take" the wheel! The bomb! Where's the bomb? It's right here. You dummy. Grab it! It's gonna blow! What is it about you rotten good guys? You always win. Drat. Drat. Drat! Our troubles are over. When good friends pull together, they can do anything. That's right! I've found a friend in you. One that surely will endure. Loneliness has just one cure. The friend I found in you. We're alive and well. And living here on Living Island. Living every happy day. Alive and well on Living Island. Living here in harmony. And hope someday. We hope someday the whole world will live this way. A most amazing place. Living Island is the most amazing place. Living Island is the most amazing place. Living Island is the most amazing place. Living Island is the most amazing place. Living Island is the most amazing place. The end? That's what they think. I'll get them yet! Oh, go home and have a nightmare.
