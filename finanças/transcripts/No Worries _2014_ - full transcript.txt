How are you? - What are you doing? - It s for school. We have to take unusual pictures. Let s play! Come on! Come back! Yes! Nice, Adrian. That s my son. Get back into position. It s his son. Watch the defense. Fuck... Hey, your kid is not in the game. - Fall in, boys. Toni, take it easy. It s OK. Game s not over yet. So what s our motto? We have to stay... - United! Adrian, you re out. Guillaume will be stepping in. - Why are you taking Adrian out? - So everyone can get to play. - Oh yeah? - Careful. That s a foul! - That s a penalty shot! - Penalty shot. Rémy, you ll take the shot. - Jesus, is he kidding or what? - Alright, just cool it. Choose a corner and stick to that position. Why can t you ask someone else? - You can make it. Don t pressure me. I m not, I m motivating you. Focus! You got it. You got it. Come on! Do it! "Don't worry" Fire that ball in there. Go. - Go for it! Yeah! Two washouts. Like father, like son. Whoa! Hey hey hey! Are you nuts or something? Jesus, guys. I m sorry. You shame me in front of my son and then you say you re sorry? - Rémy! - Give him some air! Marc! Rémy passed out - What s wrong with him? - What s going on? Rémy! He took the shot and then he just fell down. You OK? What happened? He just fell down right after he took the shot. Breathe through your mouth. Do you like your new house? - A lot. I got my own room. You can get dressed, sonny. Is there anything wrong, doctor? There s something abnormal about his blood platelets. You need to see a specialist. - Everything was fine in the ER. They didn t have his blood work. Go see Dr. Maillot. He s very good. They ll have to draw more blood from Rémy. Again? That s too much! It s the last time, honey. Don t worry. Just a small concern. I prefer having a specialist s opinion. All right? I ll refer Rémy then. - But why? - Because! Where s the ketchup? - Right there. Behind you. - Are we ever going to unbox? Well, don t mind me! - Everybody s got a pet! - Everyone but us. A hamster won t piss everywhere. We said no. Can I just once have a nice, calm dinner? - What s that? - The fuses must have blown. - Some house! Eat your ghost-shaped mash. He said don t worry . Yeah... He also said not to wait with the appointment. It s strange. No, it just means he s good at his job, he s professional. You ve always been this anxious. Remember when I first came back from the hospital with Lisa, and you couldn t stop checking up on her, to see she was OK? Yeah, I remember that. - Still with this invoice? - I m going as fast as I can. Will it be ready by lunch? - Yes. - You know, Claire, if you want a permanent position, you ll have to perform your tasks much quicker. Hello? Something came up at work. Can you take Rémy? - How long will it take? - Half an hour, tops. OK, I ll take care of it. Kisses. Manu, can you cover for me? - Sure, sure. Mrs. Letellier ? Right through here. Half an hour, my ass. We had an 11 o clock appointment. Now it s almost noon. Will this be ready by tonight? Where s Marc? In the bathroom. How long are you going to keep taking me for a fool? Do you have an explanation? Rémy had to have some blood drawn for tests. Look, we ve all got kids. If we walked out on our jobs every time they had a problem... - Alright, I got it. - Hey hey, we re not friends here! Alright? Don t pull this trick again. Are we clear? Are we clear? We re clear. Has your daddy s car ever broken down? Once. He was so angry he kept kicking it. - And then what happened? - We took it to the shop. It turned out to be the engine. Ah. Well, blood is a lot like an engine, you see. It s made up of different things. If even one thing is off, the blood can t work right. So my engine is down. That s right. You won t kick me now, Dad, will you? Will I stay in the hospital for a very long time? I don t know. I ll first try and take care of this for you. Do you have other questions? No. That s OK. I need to speak to your parents. Will you give us a minute? Would you like some water? What did you mean by try and take care of this ? I ve been head of this ward for the past 30 years. My team is highly skilled. You need to trust us. However, there are several types of leukemia. The tests will... Claire! Claire! Are you OK? - Come on, now. Easy, easy. There you are. You OK? There you go. It s complicated. He won t be able to stay at home. When s he going back to the hospital? Monday. The doctor wants to start treatment immediately. But that s completely normal. The sooner we start things, the better things are. - And how s Rémy taking all this? We prefer not to tell him too much at the moment. What s wrong with you?! What, can t I hug my baby brother anymore? You re a pain. Because of you, I came in 8th. - See that? You got a TV. - Great. Private bathroom. Does it have a Jacuzzi? - Hello. - Hello. - Hi. - I m the head nurse. Sorry I couldn t greet you myself. Are you Rémy? - Yes. - You can hang some posters up. The more you feel at home, the better you ll feel. If you need anything at all, just press this button and we ll be right there. OK. But what if I don t need anything and I m just bored? - Go ahead and press it anyway. Someone will always be there to listen to you. Will Dr. Maillot come by? - Not tonight. - Ma am? - You can speak freely to me. What is your name? Véra. Thank you, Véra. Thanks. Give me a clue. Will an omelet do? Yes. Lisa, set the table. Can you please set the table? - Cut it out! - You re not doing anything! You keep this up, you re gonna get in trouble. It s not my fault Rémy s sick! You still haven t asked how he was doing. I called him! - Stop it! - You called him, did you? We re going through a nightmare. We have to support each other. - Give me your hands. - No. Do it! We have to stay together if we want to stay strong. OK? - Is that what he tells players? - No wonder they keep losing. - Again?! - Dad, can t you fix it? Marc? He s awfully calm. I know. Me, if my kids get a cold I freak out. Does Toni know? - Of course he does. And he s still sore with him? - Marco! Lunch together? - Sure thing. What do you think of my sister? She seems very nice. We used to fight a lot before. But now she keeps kissing me. You don t like it when she kisses you? I do, but I like it more when we fight. What do you think of my parents? - Not too bad, as parents go. - They act as if everything was like it was before. - This came as a shock to them. They have to get used to it. Is what I have kind of bad, normal bad, or very bad? I don t know. What do you think? I think it s quite bad. You know what? I ll act as if it wasn t so bad. All right. See you in a bit? You have to rest up. OK? See you later. We don t know what s going to happen. He s in the hospital and I d wanted to ask you... I m no monster. Of course you can get away. But I ll be running this office. - Yes. People wouldn t understand how I can give you preferential treatment while on trial period. I ll go see my son outside of working hours. OK. Well, I m working on a big client. Would you like to help me? - Yes. If you d like, we could have lunch to discuss it. What am I saying... You re going to see your son, aren t you? That s OK. We can discuss it when you re back. Thank you. Do other parents just stop working? People do what they can. There are no rules to this. But... If I may... Rémy wouldn t like me to tell you this, but... He feels very lonely. How s your son doing? - He s fine. - Good, good. I ll go get the file. That s OK, I ve asked someone else to take care of that. I fought hard to get this job. I wanted my children to have a house one day. I don t know what to do anymore. I wasn t ready for this. Do you understand, Mom? A what? OK. We ll talk about it tomorrow. Me too. Kisses. - They really have that? - Yes. It s called Parental Presence Leave . But only one of the parents can get it. - And the salary? - Well, you don t get one. That d be heaven on earth. But Social Services will give you a compensation. A daily allowance that s worth half the salary. We won t make it, not with the loan we took out on the house. Would you rather we left Rémy all alone? And what about when he comes home after chemotherapy? My parents are 500kms away and yours are too old. We d lose more money if we hired a care attendant. We don t have a choice. - How do you get this leave? - You have to ask your employer, and then you submit an application. Your bosses will say no. Hmm. We ll see. I ve read your son s medical certificate. I m going to approve this leave. Thank you. My wife tried to to get it, but it s complicated. There s no need to justify. Thanks very much. How much is the allowance? 900. And he pays 1,000 back every month on the house. Well, that was a stupid loan to take! - How could they know? - No shit. You get 22 days per month. - And nothing on weekends? - I guess. As if the kid won t still be sick on weekends? - Will you stop whining? Go ahead, eat up. Oh, are you going to let me be? What? I m taking pictures of people I love. Well, I m flattered, but I d be much happier if you finished that plate that s in front of you. - But it s gross. - That may be. But finish up or things are going to get hot. I saw that! Is she in a good mood? If you want to ask for a raise, forget it. - No, just a day off. You can always give it a go. - Could I ask you for... - Listen, I can t spare the time. Thomassin just cancelled all of their orders. - What s that about? - I have no idea. She should have come. It s not easy at work for your mother right now, you know. Hi. - Time to get out. - Where s Mom? She couldn t make it. Are you OK? I m going to be sick. Well, don t just stand there! Shall I leave it open? He didn t want me to kiss him good night. Don t worry about it. He ll forget it by morning. It makes sense that he s tired. I keep checking on him to see that he s breathing normally. He s still sleeping. I have a meeting. - What should I do for breakfast? - Everything s in the fridge. If you call me for every little thing... OK. I have to go. Hey. Made you breakfast, and you can tell me all that s new. Take a seat then. I m not hungry. You OK? Wanna play some video games? I don t feel like it. Scared of losing, eh? If you need anything, just give a shout. - OK. So what did you guys do? I cleaned up, for the 10th time this week. I m turning into a real homebody over here. And him, nothing. He spends all day on his computer. Don t you talk to him? I m 39 years old, he s 9. What do you want us to talk about? We talk about food. He doesn t like my cooking. Dad, tell Mom to stop worrying so much. Yes, I m doing just fine. I promise. Talk to Grandpa, Grandma? - No, I don t feel like it. He s just waking now. Can you call back later? Kisses. Usually you like talking to them. I m tired, leave me alone. Can t you make a little effort?! You OK? Albert and I wanted you to know that you can call us if you need anything. Why don t you call me? We don t want to disturb you. To disturb me? I m not doing anything. I just hang out the whole day. I ve been working since I was 16, Manu, you know? I can t take it anymore. I feel uncomfortable around my son. I can t seem to talk to him. Yesterday I locked myself in the bathroom just to... ...To catch my breath. There! You got it! I only wanted to be coach so I could spend more time with him. Hey, since you re smarter than everyone, why don t you be coach? - Mom? - Yes? Smile. Come on, you can do better than that! Stop it! Gimme that! Gimme that! Oh, if I catch you...! What s that? That s your new weekly schedule. Monday morning, math. Afternoon, history and geography, dictations on Tuesdays, etc. No more computer or TV. There s no point in sighing. And who s going to be my teacher? You are? - And why not? - You didn t even graduate from high school. - You want to get smacked? You wouldn t hit a sick child, would you? Don t take advantage of it. We begin tomorrow. Still not finished? We do less of them in school. Some more effort and you ll get a reward. A big slice of pie. - Did you make the pie? - Yes. And that s what you call a reward? How far along are you? Are you cold? - A bit. Put this on. Here. Is that better? - Much better. - You OK? - Yes. What s the smell? - Why, thank you... Seriously though. Is that a hamster? - It s for Rémy. - You could have told me. - I did it on a whim. You could have called, you know. You said not to call you for every little decision I make. I see you and Rémy are getting along just fine... - So what s the problem here? Are they talking? Looks like they re fighting. Because of you. - Or you. You suck at school. - Right... They are fighting. When I come home, he barely even talks to me. - So stop working. I wouldn t have to work if... - If what? Why did Toni get that job, and not you? - They offered it. I refused. - You refused? - Yes, I did. Can you really see me giving orders to my buddies? The truth is that you shirk responsibly. Me? Shirking responsibility? I wasn t scared to quit my job. - That has nothing to do with it. Yes, it does! You hide behind your job. Now, that. That s the truth. Yes. You re right. I m scared. It s only when I sleep that I don t think about it. I open my eyes when I wake up and there s this fear there. If I stopped working, I would completely break down. I wouldn t make it, Marc. I couldn t. Come on, let s go before they start worrying. I ll be right there. Please, Rémy, we re eating. Enough with the rat. - Not a rat, a hamster. - Same thing. Come on. What if I named him Harry? - That s a good name. - Mom. - That s not bad. - You know, at school... - Are you cold? - No. Did you know that... - Do you need some help? - No. - Daddy... - Want to play chess later? You ll lose. I find that hard to believe. I m pregnant. What?! I d say anything to get noticed! Hi, I m Lisa, and I m your daughter. - Oh, your face... - You scared me! You ll be happy here, Harry. My father s not very good, as far as teachers go. But as a dad, he s the best. My mom s great, always is. But she s been a pain recently. It s like she s been angry with me even since I ve been sick. Go back into your cage. Go. Get some sleep. Come on, little Guinea Pig. Hi, Véra. - Hi, Rémy. What is that? Is that a rat? - No. It s Harry. Can I keep it with me? - No. - Are you nuts? I didn t know... - I should hope so! Oh no! Calm down! Please calm down! It s just a hamster. Where is it? Behind the bin. - I got it, I got it. Wait. - Careful. It s all good. You re taking pictures now? - Yes. - I ll get him out of here. You re too good. You re going to win. Careful. Wait. Show me. My turn. Here, sweetheart. Rémy s been in treatment for 3 months and we have yet to achieve the desired effect. Are you going to up the chemotherapy dosages? We re seriously considering it, yes. Will he need to go into a sterile room? It s mandatory. Rémy s immune system will be losing all of its defenses. This is not time to lose heart. Rémy needs you. We can win this fight. OK. I got it. - Who was that? - The bank. Again? Are you memorizing these receipts or what? - Food prices went up. I can tell you haven t done the shopping in a long time. Damnit. When are we calling the electrician? We have to cut back. Would you have us stop eating? We need to save money. It s my fault. It s that mortgage. Well, you ve got that house now. We made that decision together. No, you did! I didn t force anything on you. Hey, I m right here! Shut up, Lisa. I didn t want it. But I caved in. Just like with everything. I didn t want a second child! And look where we are now! You need to make things right with Marc again. He was your best man. - He humiliated me. Your issues don t concern your children and their lives. Adrian wants to see Rémy. He misses him. No. I don t want Adrian to see kids without their hair. That s just the thing. It s rare, but Rémy hasn t lost his. Oh really? How do you know that? I m not fighting with them. I call to get some news. Where you off to like that, sonny? Hello, Ma am. Can you tell me where Rémy s room is? What a gentleman! Rémy can t see visitors now, except for family members. - Oh. - Sorry about that. The way out s through here. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - How are you? - What are you doing here? It took a while to find you. Can I come in? No. You need a mask. - Shit. That s dumb. - Yep. Hold on, let me take your picture. You re dumb. Adrian! Bye, lame-o. Bye, numbnuts. Say, what did I tell you? - So... How is he? - He s fine. Come on. I prefer your massages than Martine s... - Doesn t she give good ones? - Yes, but her breath stinks. - Come on, Rémy. First off, that s not true. Now I wonder what you say about me. - You smell very good. - Ah. Except for your feet. Why you... You ll get it alright. Do you massage your husband? Do I ask you questions? Don t you have a husband? Do you have children? Don t you want to tell me? - No. I thought we were friends. We are friends, but it doesn t mean we have to tell all. Here, buddy. We re home. Véra says you have to separate professional and private life. She s right. She has a very difficult job, you know. Did you stop with the questions? - Yes. I m not a idiot. I asked the other nurses. So? Is she married? Nobody knows. Let s go take a walk. I can t go out too much. I m still fragile, you know. Exactly. You need some fresh air. - You OK? - Yes, I m fine. - You re not cold? - No. Let s play who can pee the furthest out. OK. The small one looks like the neighbor s poodle. The one who stinks? - Yeah. - Get outta here then! You ok back there? - Yeah. What is it? Oh, here it is. I was worried sick, looked everywhere for it. Hurry up. - I want to kiss Rémy. - He s sleeping. You re acting funny. No, not really. - Whose ring is that? - Hello? Who is it? Answer me. No. You didn t. We ll have to cut down our commission. Hold on, let me get back to you. Hello. What are you doing here? Your husband asked me to come see the house. - What? - Just for an estimate. You re organizing viewings behind my back? I could come back. No, please! Help us box our things up while you re here! Stop it. What are you doing? I m afraid we haven t had time to re-paint everything... Cut it out. Cut it out! - You didn t say anything! Because you won t talk about it! We can t ask for help from our parents. The bank called again. They might foreclose on the house. What do we do? I ll leave you to it. Thank you. I ll call you. She was just next to me. - We want to talk to you kids. - You want to do this now? - Yes. - Are you getting a divorce? - No. Why would you say that? - You fight all the time. It s not always easy, but it happens with couples. We get married for better or for worse. I m the worst. Don t say that. What s wrong? We ve been thinking. We ve looked it over from all angles. We can t make it financially, so... We re selling the house. - What? - Is it my fault? - No. Life is expensive. I know we ve grown attached to this house. God knows we ll even miss the fuses that keep popping. But whether we re here or in a shack is not important. What s important is that we stay together, the four of us. Right? - We mustn t sell the house. - No. But I have an idea. If we put a rat in every room, no one will come to see the house. You know what would be a better idea? - That I get well? - Well, of course. I saw an athlete on TV the other day who said that you could do anything with the power of the mind. You think that if I kept repeating get better , it would actually work? Try it. Doesn t cost anything. Mmm. Claire? What are you thinking about? I m making an inventory. My son is sick. My daughter hates me. My boss treats me as if I was just a child. We have to sell the house. It s not the life I bargained for. - As Rémy said: could be worse. - Oh yeah? You ll get a permanent contract. No. It s not a done deal. - Why? - My trial period was renewed. You find that funny? No, I don t think it s funny, but... But it ll be fine, won t it? Fuck... We re screwed. Oh shit... We re up shit creek. Up shit creek! - Yes! Help us! Ah! I can t take it anymore. Wait. Shut the door. - We ll wake them. - Who cares? Are you sure? You heard me. Rémy is in remission. That does not mean healed . We ll still need to watch him. Does that mean that we can hope? - Yes, it does. I told you! I knew it! Thank you. - Go see him. - Thank you. Go. - Lisa! - What? Where are you? Come here. Your brother s in remission. - Get out! - I swear. - What did he say? Something weird. He talked of his mental strength. I didn t get it. I did. Tomorrow we ll all go to pick him up together. Aren t you scared? No. Hold on, let s see what she s got in her. Faster! Faster! - Dad! - Huh? - Wake up. - What? You ll be late for work. Come on. Wake up. - Yeah. So? - Hey! Marc! - Marc ! - It s good to see you. - You alright? - How are you? - I forgot the combination. Mine s my birthday. Albert? He s forgotten his combination. - Alright, alright... - What about yours? - Mine s my wedding day. - Oh, isn t that cute! - Mine s my divorce day. - Which one? Mine is March 12th 1992, the day I popped my cherry. Athletic build, 1.85cm, shoulders like this. - You sure it was a girl? - Shut up, asshole. What a sorry bunch. - So José likes em big, eh? - Let s get to it. Go work. Shut the door? Here we are. You don t want to go? Are you kidding? When you can t go to school, it s even worse than going. No, it s not that. What is it, then? What if the other kids behave differently with me? - They ll be happy to see you. They ll have some questions, but everything will be like it was. Have a great day. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye now. Hey! Hi, Rémy. That s good. Thanks. Where s Marc? Don t tell me he walked out on his post again! Rémy passed out at school. They took him to the hospital. He asked me where Marc was. I wasn t going to fib. - Hi. - Hi. - Everything A-OK? - Any news about Rémy? He s relapsed. Back to square one. - Fuck. Remission didn t last very long. - You said it... - Has Marc come back? - He s in Faucon s office. Toni ratted him out? Looks like it. - Have a good day. - Have a good one, guys. Oh no, he didn t! What came over you? I didn t think. You never abandon your post. You could have talked to Toni. So what will you do? Will you stop work again? I haven t had time yet to discuss it with my wife. We re crushed under debt. You still have some leave days, did you know that? - I don t think so. - Well, you do. Are you sure? Exactly five. Use them. You re entitled to them. It ll be a week s salary. Some time to mull it over. All right. All right. Toni? Marc will be using a 5-day leave. Won t you regret it? Giving him your leave to use? - He was my best man. - Why don t you tell him? He s proud. He d never take them. - You re doing a good thing. Rémy s relapsed. It ll be more than 5 days till he s better. Marc needs more time, a lot. The disease is spreading with every passing day. I ve seen sick children. You never get used to it. So you re on Parental Presence leave? - Yes. For the last 2 months. - Why have you come to see me? You didn t come all the way here to give me news of Rémy. We can t make it with what Social Security s giving us. I have to get back to work. But leaving Rémy all alone... Have you seen a social worker? - Yes. There are volunteers. Yes. But we don t know for how long. I don t want him to spend his days with a complete stranger. - I see. You know I m not that guy. I know. I ll give you two weeks of sick leave. After that, we ll see. - Thank you. Thanks. Merci beaucoup. How are things with Mom and Dad? Meh... I m glad they re here. What is it, Rémy ? Nothing. You can talk to me, you know. You wouldn t understand. Hi, Véra. Don t you recognize me? Sofiane! You ve grown so much! To what do I owe the honor? I missed my favorite nurse. - Oh, you sweet talker! - It s true. Say, do you... Do you know her? - It s a patient s sister. - Introduce me. - You don t need me for that. - Come on. OK. Just because it s you! Lisa, this is Sofiane. He s a very nice young boy and... And I ve got work. - Hi. - Hey. Oh. How are you? How long were you sick? - Three years. - Three years? Can you do me a favor? - Yeah, anything. - Really? Come on. All right. See you later. You really talked in there. - Yeah. - What did he tell you? You wouldn t understand. He looks really cool. I ll come see him again. - Tomorrow? Will you be here? At noon. OK. See you tomorrow. - Aren t my grades interesting? - I didn t see it came in. - Your grades have gone down. - Yes. You promised you d make more of an effort, Lisa. - I know. - Yeah. Now you know what you ve got to do. That s it? Moving on? - What do you want us to say? You could yell at me. Punish me. Do your job as parents. I m invisible to you. - No, you re not. It s been three weeks that my hair s different. And you haven t noticed. - Yes, I did. Lisa... Don t tell me it s because Rémy is sick. It s been like this ever since he was born. Lisa! You re not on stand-by, but we can t do this in 5 minutes. We ll keep to our protocol in the coming week. We re still waiting on the results to come back. Based on those, we will adapt the treatment. Didn t you think Maillot was a bit different? Different how? Cold. Distant. Not his usual self. I can relate. He has a tough job. - And I don t. Because I m dumb. - Oh, please, Marc. He s at his wits end. - Are you a doctor now? - I ve got eyes. And you re blind. - Pull over. - What? - Pull over! Where are you going? So we can t even talk? What do you want?! I m sick of Maillot repeating the same thing all the time! I can t live with someone who gives up like that. - Manu! - No, no. Please. Is Claire here? We had a fight. Marco. Is she here? Marco, relax. Claire s here. Come on in. When was the last time you spent some time between adults? You really need a breather. Go eat out Saturday night. - Yes. We know a great place. Rémy s coming Friday. We can watch him. Yeah. - What are you doing? - I m booking a table. - No, don t. - Hush now. Hello? Good evening. I d like to reserve a table for two for Saturday night. - Are you sure you ll be fine? - Yes. - Will you be all right? - Hurry up. - If anything happens... - I know, I got your numbers. Come on, scat. - You ll help them. - Yes. Have fun. Thanks! - I thought they d never leave. - I m going up. Want to play some video games? - I don t feel so good. - What s wrong? I feel like throwing up. You OK? I was joking. Oh, for Pete s sake! I ll get you for this! Go on, dinner s served. Will they be fine? Let s talk about something else. You sure there s a signal here? OK, what should I talk about then? Anything except Rémy, Lisa, Dr. Maillot, the house. And your mother. We can talk about mine. You think it s a father with his daughter? - I hope not. Why? They were making out earlier. And what about them, are they a couple? No, not yet. They re on their first date. They re like dogs in heat. In 10 minutes they ll ask for the check and run all the way to their hotel room. What do you think they re saying about us? They re saying... They look like they ve known one another for a long time. They don t realize how far they ve drifted apart. They re also saying... They look tired. Must be going through a hard time. It s not certain they ll make it. But then they ll say... Yet they look like they want to hang on for the long haul. They want to save their marriage. Because... They still have love. Read what they say at the end. Your son is the one who s sick, not you. Can you believe it? We pushed it too far. They want me to get sick? If need be, I ll break my own arm. That wouldn t help anything. Social Services have you on their sights. What do we do? I can t give you anymore sick leave. He s got a fever. I have to go. I ll see you tonight. - Have you heard about Social? - Yes, Manu told me. I m not surprised. Social Services have a huge debt. But to say, your son is the one who s sick, not you ? That was not clever. - Toni? - Yes? Did you have a minute to look into my days off left? - Can it wait? Can I count on it? - I ll let you know tomorrow. - I ve been hearing this 3 months. Two days off aren t a huge deal, are they? I ll keep you posted. Shit, battery s dead. Hello? Yes, Claire, he s right here. Hold the line. I ll get him. Marco? Claire, for you. Hello? Where is he? You scared me. OK. What s going on? Claire just called. She couldn t get a hold of him. Me too. Keep me posted. Yes. Rémy is in the hospital. His temperature went up. It s OK, he s under observation. - Go. - Huh? Don t just stand there. Go! Thank you. What are you doing? You OK? You were supposed to get coffee. - I can t find the machine. End of the hall. I get lost all the time too. Hold me. Hold me close. - Manu? - Yeah? At noon, get everyone in the warehouse. Don t tell Marc. Pass the word along. - OK. We always stood together. When Claude had money problems, we all chipped in. But this is different. What if we forfeited us all our paid leave days? - Whoa... - What? What if we had a sick kid? And we didn t know if he d live. We d want to spend every minute by his side without having to worry about money. Right? So what Marc needs, is time. If we all gave him our paid leave days, he d have time. We work all year. The days are long. We earned that paid leave. - I know. It s just a thought. So? What do you guys think? It s not just a small favor. We have to think about it. Take your time. Talk to your families. All right. What s your decision? Since Toni was made team leader, he s living the life. He doesn t really need time off. I don t get it. Marc doesn t have any days? - He does. He has some left. But he ll only get half of his salary again. They re doing fine. They hardly make their loan payments. They re a stone s throw away from going bankrupt. The bank doesn t give a crap, whether their kid s sick or not. - It s not up to us to help him. Why can t the owner pay him a full-time salary? He wouldn t even feel it. Sure... Go ask him then. You think that s funny? No, no. Shh! Hi. I gather you ve spoken to your wives and have now made your decisions. Maybe it d be better if I saw each of you in private. Toni, we re a team of 16. We ll know soon enough who was on board or not. Let s be clear about something. This is not an obligation. Those who vote no will not be judged in any way. Well, this won t come as a shock. - Hey! - What? Only fools don t change their minds. You think that s funny? What s wrong with you? Is it your wife who s against it? It s for your friend! Jesus, Manu, get off my back! You call this no judgement ? I can t believe it. Ease up, Manu. I m sure he has his reasons. We re 16 to forfeit paid time-off days. - 15. We won t get far with that. Let s talk to the other teams. The more we are, the better it ll be. Are you putting down two days of paid leave for Marc? - No. 3. Thank you. Guys, have you thought about what I asked you? Yeah, but we don t know him. Have you ever spoken to him? - Not really. - We all work here together. You re going to pull the big family routine on us? Your wife s name is Sabin. Your daughter s, Zoe. Am I wrong? No. I mean, my daughter s name is Chloe. And yet we don t know each other very well. Come on, guys. Have a good think, eh? Go on. - Yeah, OK. José! Come in. Hello. Do you have a minute? - Yes, come in, come in. Sir. Hello. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Well... Is this a hostage-taking? No. It s about Marc. Ah. - You know why he agreed? - No. Good media coverage. - Ah. - It ll be good publicity. - He s a wily one. - A regular bleeding heart... I haven t had a chance to look at the schedule yet. It s not about that. Everyone s angry at me. They re looking at me crooked. - It s in your head. - Oh yeah? It s been two days since you ve even talked to me. Marc is my friend. If I could give him all of my paid leave days, I would in a heart beat. My mother is very ill. - Since when? It s been three years now. My brothers and sisters and I take turns taking care of her. That s why I need all of my paid leave days. There s a lot of organization. I can t stand them up. Why didn t you ever say anything? I don t know... I... I didn t want to bother you with my problems. I don t want Marc to think I m not with him on this. - He d never think that. And he ll never know either. There s absolutely no telling him who gave or didn t give, the owner and I agreed on that. I ll take care of your days. Thanks, Toni. Rémy s been asking questions. He talked to me about reincarnation earlier. He s been sick for a year. He understands everything. But he needs guidance. You need to talk to him about what might happen. Really talk to him. We need to talk. - Has the house been sold? - No. Your mother and I, we wanted to talk about your condition. Are you sure? Are you ready? I m not going to sugarcoat what we have to talk about. My condition is very serious. My white blood cells are infected. You need to understand this right now. It s no laughing matter. It really isn t. Hey, you guys. Marc, can you come see me during your break? If it s to fire me, you can do it right here and now! No, it s not that. You ll be there then? Marc! Wait. Follow me, please. Is this a trial or what? So, Marc. Toni and your colleagues came to see me about a project. They asked if the could forfeit their paid leave days to you so you could take care of your son. I ve accepted. But your colleagues wouldn t stop there. They ve spoken to all the factory staff. The printing house was filled with a flair of solidarity. A day or two off is nothing to us, really. But for you, you... You ll put it to good use. We ve collected 62 days. Which will be around 3 months to spend at Rémy s bedside. - I can t accept this. - We refuse your refusal. Rémy s condition concerns all of us here. We weren t going to twiddle our thumbs, watching you work. We re not heartless. - Now you can take care of Rémy without worrying about schedules, paychecks or Social Security. Come on. Come here. - Thank you. - You re not alone. We re with you, all right? Jesus, you re nuts, guys! Thank you. Fuck. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Holy Moly! So you can stay with me? - Yes. - Will you have to pay them back? - No. That s even more awesome. - I ll make you some more pies. - Oh. Lisa! Shit, it s my mom! Do you think she s seen us? You haven t told her? Are you crazy? I ll be off, I ll call you tonight. What are you doing here? - Who s that? Nobody. - Do you always hold hands? - We weren t holding hands! What? Nothing. I m looking at you. Is it serious with that boy? - Mom... - I was a teenager once, tell me. - It s been a while since I could talk to you. - Really? Well, I don t know. I think so. When I don t see him for a day, I freak out. Does that make it important? No doubt. Why did you come get me? Is it Rémy ? We talked to Dr. Maillot. Your brother has to go back into the sterile room. The chemotherapy will be getting a lot stronger. It s the last resort. What if it doesn t work? The new treatment starts Monday. Maillot approved us to take Rémy with us this weekend. Dad and I want this weekend to be... Nice. Really nice. OK? OK. My baby... Come on, let s skedaddle. See you Monday, Vera. - Some time away from you. - And for me too! - You re like an old couple. - Get a selfie together? Just for you, go ahead. - See you Monday. - You bet. Have a good weekend. - What s wrong? - Nothing. I m sick of this job, is all. - I ll have a contract in 2 weeks. - So you re not selling the house? We don t know yet. Faucon s here. We should go talk to him. Go ahead. - I barely know him. He s coming this way. - Hello. - Mr. Faucon. - It s a nice day. - We were just saying. It s going to last, they say. - Hey, handsome. - Hey, Rémy. - I ll introduce you to my mom. - Right now? Well, yeah. Hello, young man. - Say cheese! - Ah. Look here, eh? Turn around? That s right. Oh. He s got the picture. Toni! What? Offside. You kidding or what? - You looking to get carded? - Oh, I see how it is. You re worse than your dad! - Are you hiding? - No, it s not that. I just wish this day would never end. You know, ma am, I once had Rémy s condition. - I know, Lisa told me. I just wanted to say that... I was in the sterile room 3 times. Sofiane? Thank you. Claire? Where s Marc? I don t know. Marc? What are you doing there? Everyone s looking for you. I can t talk to them. I can t look them in the eye. What they ve given me is so... You know? - Mmm. The only way to thank them would be if Rémy got better. We re not quitting. Not now. We made it every time. We must have faith. Rémy is so strong. - You too. Here you are. I can t entertain all of our guests on my own. Come on, this is no time to make love. We ll be right there. I found them. Ah! Where were you off to? In order to legalize solidarity, the French National Assembly adopted a bill aiming to allow the giving of paid leave days to a sick child s parent. To this day, this bill has yet to be validated by the French Senate. MFP Subtitling.
