♪♪ [harp] We're late. Let's go. I really need to get those new shoes. I'm not spending $120 for a pair of sneakers. What? Sorry. If you really have to have them, I'll split them with you, okay? Can we go in the toy store? Not today. I have raised up my servant, Emmanuel David Isaiah, ever my righteous right hand, to be the light and covenant to my people, to all those who repent and come unto me. For in my servant, Emmanuel, is the fullness of the Gospel. People will trust you more without your beard. And people are fools. Hephzibah Eladah Isaiah, thou were chosen to be helpmate to Emmanuel, to be submissive and obedient to thy husband. You will now take into your heart seven sisters to share your home. Seven jewels... gifts given only to the most righteous of men. It is good. It is good. Peace be with you. We'll be a little late. Can you spare some change? Uh, sorry. We don't have any money. Say, can you spare some change? Uh, yeah. You live around here? Uh, actually, my sister and I are walking the earth, spreading the word of God. I'm a good handyman, if you have need. Well, my husband often hires men to do various jobs around the house... construction, yard work, that sort of thing. Uh-huh. We're doing some remodeling. I'm sure he could find some work for you. Wonderful. There you go. What's your name? Emmanuel. It means "God with us." And thank you so much for this. Okay, guys. Let's go. Why did you give him money? The church teaches us to help those in need. I've been called by the Lord to preach to men who have lost faith and seek guidance. That's admirable. Oh, how's it going? "I am but humble messenger of God, traveling the earth, spreading His word." A little odd. "Little"? But a good carpenter. He knows roofing. He knows the Bible, too, or rather his interpretation of it. What? I'm just surprised. It's not like you to help me find workers. Oh, I felt sorry for him. He seemed like a nice man down on his luck. Thought he needed a break. [hammering] Here you go. Mmm. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Enjoy. ♪♪ [harp] Emmanuel? Mom, I'm going for a run. No, Elizabeth. We have to be at your school by 7:00. Coach said if I'm gonna be on the track team next year, I have to run every day. 45 minutes, and that's it. You still need time to shower, dress, eat. I'll be fine, Mom. All right. Run up at the track, and take someone with you. I've got a final tomorrow. I'll go. Okay. Let me get my shoes. Oh. I need to get back to Katie about going up to the lake with her family after school's out. Elizabeth, those two weeks at the cabin are the only time we can be together this summer. It's only six days, Mom. Please? I really wanna go. I'll discuss it with Daddy, and we'll talk about it later. But I have to get back to her, and... I said we'll talk about it later. Oh, Mrs. Traughber wants me to come in early and play my harp for everyone as they come in. Oh, great, honey. Great. [sizzling] Oh! Oh, boy. Whoo! [coughing] [grunts] Hi. Ooh! Wha... Yeah. I burned the potatoes. Ohh. Yeah. It's ten to 7:00. She's not gonna have time to play the harp. We'll be lucky if we even get there on time for the assembly. All right, all right. [garage door clanking] You know, it's been doing that all day. I'll check it out when we get back. What if someone comes in and steals all my stuff while we're gone? Trust me, no one wants your stuff. [Ed] Our Dear Father in Heaven, we come before Thee at the close of this day, thankful for our family and for all that we enjoy. We're thankful for Grandpa, his example, love, and for all that his life taught us. We pray that Thou wilt watch over and bless Grandma that she might know of our love for her. Please bless us this night and watch over us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [together] Amen. Sleep well, everyone. Let's go, boys. You gonna sleep in your own bed like a big boy? Hmm? Elizabeth. I spoke with Daddy. You can go with Katie. Thanks, Mom. Okay. [mutters] [lock clicks] [keyboard clacking] Hey. Turn the lights out when you come upstairs. Yep. Nice talking to you. "But the younger sister, who was not quite as rude as the others, "called her Cinderella. "In her ragged clothing, with her dirty face, Cinderella's was yet a hundred times more beautiful than her stepsisters." Hey, not too late, girls. Okay, Dad. Good night. You sleep well. I love you both. I love you, too. Love you. [door closes] "With her dirty face, Cinderella was yet a hundred times more beautiful than her stepsisters." [grunts] [sighs] [dog barking, distant] Thy will be done. [quietly] Get up. Get up. Who are you? What are you doing? Don't speak. Get up and come with me. What? Don't make a sound or I'll kill you, and then I'll kill the rest of your family. Put your shoes on and follow me. Now. Hurry up. Hurry. Now silence. Okay? Absolute silence. Do as I say. Keep your mouth shut. Go. Shh. Open it. Hurry. Go. [Mary Katherine] Mommy. [whimpers] What? Someone took Elizabeth. Wh-What? What, Mary Katherine? A man took Elizabeth. Oh, honey, I'm sure you were just having a dream. [sighs] Oh, she's probably downstairs asleep on the couch. Oh, sweetie, sweetie. Come here. It's okay. Elizabeth? Elizabeth? [Lois] Elizabeth? [descending footsteps] Ed... Ed! Call 911! [panting] Tell me, what happened? A man took Elizabeth. What... What man? Who was it? [phone buttons beeping] I don't know. I don't know. Mary Katherine! Yes. My daughter's been taken! Tell Mommy what happened! Yeah, yeah, she's gone! Why did he take her? I don't know. Jim, he took her! Mary Katherine saw him! He... He... He... She saw him take her! Lois! Why would he... Why would anyone do that? She saw him? Who was it? I don't know. But find her. [siren blaring] We've... We've gotta find her. We'll find her. We'll find her. We've gotta find her! Please! Please! My... My daughter was taken by a man. Behold the sword of vengeance hangeth over you, and the time soon cometh he avengeth the blood of the saints and our people. For he will not suffer their cries any longer. Where is she? They're gonna find her. The boys are looking for her. They're gonna find her. Who would do this? [door opens] Who would... Who would want to... Mrs. Smart? Hi, I'm Detective Coleman. I need to ask you a few questions. You mind if I sit down? No. Has your daughter ever snuck out of the house at night before? No. No. Elizabeth would never leave the house without... Did you have a fight? Was she angry about something? No. [camera shutter clicking] We... We had words about a vacation she wanted to take with a friend, but... but I told her she could go. Well, girls can be really sensitive at this age. Can I get the name and number of her friend? Elizabeth's not with Katie. Does she have a boyfriend? Maybe one who lives nearby? Has a car? Elizabeth doesn't have a boyfriend. She's 14. How much time does she spend on the Internet? Do you know if she was communicating [door opens] with anyone in particular? Mom! Oh, sweetie! Someone took her. [chattering] Elizabeth Smart, age 14. Apparent kidnapping. The little sister saw the guy, but she could be covering for the big sister if she snuck out. The alarm was faulty. The backdoor was unlocked. They probably left that way. The kitchen window was open, and the screen's been cut. Now, it looks to me like it was cut from the inside. Who are all these people? Friends and family. Some were here when we got here, and more keep arriving. Well, let's get them all out of here. This whole scene's been contaminated. All right. I want you to listen to me. Elizabeth is strong. She's smart. She's got good judgment. So wherever she is, she's being strong, and she's gonna need you to be strong for her. Someone took her. I don't know where she is. Lois, look at me. Look in my eyes. Our Heavenly Father knows where Elizabeth is. Believe that in your heart. She's got guardian angels all around her. Lois? Where... Where is, uh, Lois? Mr. Smart? Mr. Smart, I'm Detective Richard Kassen. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Please, can you get some more men out there looking? Everything that can be done right now is being done, sir. If I could just take a few minutes with you... Where is everyone going? This house is a crime scene, Mr. Smart. We have to take every precaution to make sure that whatever evidence is here is not compromised in any way. Yes, I understand. All right. Good. Let me just clear a few things up. Your daughter's name was Elizabeth? Yes. Is Elizabeth. Right. Has she ever run away before? No. No, she didn't run away. She was taken. I know how girls this age can be. They think they know everything... Excuse me. What's being done? We're gonna take you and your family down to the station. [Officer] Sir, you can't go in there. Station? It's okay, Officer. Excuse me. Wait a minute. What is it? Who is this guy? My brother Jim. What are you doing? I gotta get her picture on the news. Pete, set up a house-to-house search in the neighborhood. Make sure you clear the homes on the streets above the Smart place. Oh, and, uh, see if you can get the chopper to do a flyover. All right. Mr. Smart, you may wanna get some clothes on. [crying] [helicopter blades whirring] [door buzzes] What's going on? Have a seat, Mr. Smart. Where's my family? What... What's... What's being done? Everybody's fine. Your family's just fine. Have a seat, please. All right. Look, here's the problem. We don't have a whole lot to go on. We got a nine-year-old girl woken up in the middle of the night who thinks maybe she saw someone. Mary Katherine got a good look at the man. She said he was wearing a dark-colored cap... I'm gonna level with you, Mr. Smart. I came in here to talk to you alone, just you and me. Please, where are my children? They're fine, Mrs. Smart. Your mother has the little ones, and Mary Katherine and the older boy are right next door. Now, we need to clear up a few things. How would you describe your marriage? You got a mortgage. You got a job and a wife. You got six kids. That's a lot on your plate. Sometimes you can react in a moment. You make a mistake, you explode, things... What does any of this have to do with finding my daughter? Mr. Smart, I have to ask you these questions, all right? It's procedure. So, do you have something to tell me? I'm right here. Your husband ever get angry with you or your children? What? No. No. I... I wanna go home. I wanna be there when Elizabeth gets home. I need... No, what we need to do is get a good picture of the family. Now, what kind of father is your husband? My husband did not take Elizabeth. Now bring me my children now. I just have a few more questions. Please bring me my children now! You think it's me. You think I took my daughter and... And what? Hid her somewhere? Is that what happened? I did not take my daughter. I understand you've got to clear me. I... I... I get that now. But, please, you're wasting time. We've got to find Elizabeth before they get too far. Mr. Smart, in our experience, when a young girl is taken from her home like this, it is usually by someone that she knows well, all right? And she is usually found within two miles of her own home. Did you know that? No. Your son Charles was home, is that right? Yes. And does he get along with your daughter? They fight? They close? We're wasting time. Charles had nothing to do with this. You think it might be someone you know? I'm not sure. You said his voice sounded familiar. Yes, but not someone I know. He was as tall as Charles. Charles. Is that your big brother? How old is Charles? He's 15. So you and your sister are pretty close in age. You guys fight a lot? Not a lot. Sometimes, I guess. You know, I had a sister. I know how that can be. Sometimes she makes you so angry, you just don't know what to do. Not really. She's pretty, that's for sure. Maybe one of your friends likes her. Everyone likes her. No, I mean in a special way, like... like a boyfriend. No. [chattering] [siren blares] [Officer] Keep those people back, you hear me? [Woman] Make sure you get a shot of both! [Reporters shouting questions] Jim, wha... I need you to talk to the media. Oh, no, Jim. I don't wanna say... We need the press. We've got to get this story out now, this minute. We can't afford to lose any more time. The first few hours are critical. We need you to talk to the public. We need you to talk to whoever has her. Could you talk to us? Tell us something? Look this way, please. Please, whoever took Elizabeth, I can't imagine why you would take her. She's our daughter. Please let her go or... or bring her home. Please bring her back. I would pray that you realize she's just a child. This guy seems real. She's our daughter. I'm gonna call the FBI. She needs to be home with us. [Man] Elizabeth! [Woman] Elizabeth! Elizabeth! [Jim] There's this guy that's offered to fly over the area in his Cessna. Good. And I spoke to Dawn Anderson from the Laura Recovery Foundation. She flew in from Texas last night when she heard. She's helping us set up a search center at the Shriners Hospital. What did she have to say? She said we gotta keep Elizabeth's name front and center. Daily press briefings, color posters with all of her information along the bottom... age, height, her hair and eye color, what she was wearing the night she was taken. How many posters? [dog barking] Oh, I figure 50 to start with. 50 colored posters? That'll take a long time. Ed, 50,000 colored posters, and we need them now. We gotta cover the airports, freeways, borders, bus stations, you name it. [Man] Elizabeth! [Emmanuel] Thank thee God for delivering this jewel of innocence that we may, [crying] as members of this society, be faithful. And through this great trust of light, priceless diamonds forming. A brilliant shining diamond truth. Let us be obedient in all things and willing to sacrifice all things, even our very lives if necessary. Cold? That we be of mortal... [Emmanuel continues rambling] I wanna go home. You are home. [crying continues] You're lucky. He chose you. ...gleam in his eyes, in his heart. He who suffered and died... [Man] Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! They're looking for me. Don't worry. They'll stop. [Emmanuel] They shall not find her. She belongs to me. Elizabeth! [Emmanuel resumes rambling] [ringing] [beeping] [beeps] Hello? Who is this? No, absolutely not! [beeps] Who was that? He said he was a reporter with the Salt Lake City Gazette. He wanted to interview Mary Katherine. [ringing] I'm sorry. You can't touch that. It's still part of the crime scene. [sniffles] Can I get you something to eat or drink? How do I know if she's eating? How do I know if she's warm? You're going to find her, right? We're doing everything we can. [Emmanuel] Forget about your past life. It had no meaning. I'm all you have. I'm the one who knows the real you. [fabric tears] And that bright light that shines within you is something only I can see. I want my mom and dad. They no longer exist. Uh, this... this is a... this is a list of everyone I could remember who... who worked on the house in the last year. This is a list of all the people that attended Elizabeth's last concert. And, um, these are... these are the names of... of all of her friends that might've seen her with someone. Great. This is all gonna help. Uh, I need to get back home. I can have one of my men take you back. I need... I need to... to... Mr. Smart, are you all right? Mr. Smart? [beeps] I need an ambulance right away. Ed Smart was taken to the hospital today after he collapsed. Doctors there said he was suffering from exhaustion and stress and is expected to recover quickly. The Smart family has organized a search through the mountains behind their home with the help of thousands of volunteers. Mayor Rocky Anderson has just announced that the reward for Elizabeth's safe return is up to $250,000. The money appears to be coming from major corporations in the area and concerned local citizens. I have never seen anything quite like the scope of this search. It seems as if the whole world feels like they've lost Elizabeth. We're here to sign up. Sorry, kids. You've gotta be 18 to search. We are 18. Just be careful, okay? [People shouting] Elizabeth! [plane overhead] Elizabeth! [Man yelling] [dog barking] [Woman] Elizabeth! Elizabeth! [Man] Elizabeth, can you hear us? [Man] Elizabeth! [Woman] Elizabeth! [Man] Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Lay out the bedrolls, then come join us for God's bounty. They're still looking for me. Did I not tell you I am your salvation? You eat if I say you eat. You sleep if I say you sleep. I walked into your house and took you. God had me do that. Don't you see? You live if I let you live. Your family lives if I say they live. Now do as I say. [Man, distant] Elizabeth! [Woman, distant] Elizabeth! [Emmanuel's voice] Don't say a word or I will kill you and your family. [Man, distant] Elizabeth! [Woman] Elizabeth! [Man] Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! [yelling] Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! It's me, Daddy. [chattering] [Lois] Did we say everything? Did we remember to mention the reward again? [Man] You did fine. I don't know how they expect you to become public speakers overnight. [Ed] We just wanna say the right thing, reach whoever we can. I'm Marc Klaas. I'm here to help. I followed your story. I'm sorry about your daughter. Thank you for coming. The first thing we need to do is to get a forensic specialist up here to talk to the younger sister. She's an eyewitness, and the image of that man is burned into her retina. Now, there's a woman named Jeanne Boylan. She's the leading forensic sketch artist in the country, and I can have her here in half an hour. The police and FBI told us not to push her... that we might taint her memory. Ed, your daughter's been missing for six days. Jim... You need to try everything that you can. Uh, this is Marc Klaas. This is my brother Jim. I know who you are. Thanks for coming down. We can use all the help we can get. Ed, why don't you let me talk to your daughter? What's her name? Mary Elizabeth? Maybe I could get her to remember... You know what? We really appreciate the help, Marc, but that's not gonna happen. There's no way this kid's still alive. We're looking for a corpse. I'm sorry. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping. Jim, if I could just sit down with Ed and Lois and talk to them. I've been in their shoes, and I can empathize with what they're going through. I'll try and arrange something. How long are you in town? As long as you need. Good. Thank you. I will talk to Ed tonight. Uh, I'm gonna wanna film our conversation. Is that okay? You wanna film your "father to grieving father" conversation? Why? Who are you representing? Myself... and Fox News. They're very interested in the whole story surrounding the kidnapping, and I thought it'd be very good for this case... Go home, Mr. Klaas. I'm just here to help. [Reporters shouting questions] Hey, everyone. This is Chris Thomas. He and his partner own Intrepid Group, a public relations firm. He's put his business on hold to handle the media for us. Thank you so much. Thanks. I've got some news. Tomorrow morning, the Salt Lake City Tribune is gonna run a story that says the investigation is now pointing toward a family member. [People gasping] [Jim] You've gotta be kidding. Why? What happened to that guy that the milkman saw in the neighborhood? The guy in the green Saturn? Bret Michael Edmunds. The police are looking for him. They say they just wanna talk to him, but he has not been identified as a suspect. They can't find him so it has to be one of us? The article is gonna say that it's been determined that the window screen was cut from the inside... that the entrance was staged. Two of the reporters at the Tribune... a Kevin Cantera and Michael Vigh... claim they have four sources within the police department who will confirm what they're printing. What sources? [Man] Yeah. You can't say that. You can't just lie. In any big story, there's going to be false accusations and people who wanna get their names in the paper. People will read that. They might believe it. Well, the police have to make a statement saying it's not true. I tried. They won't. Not in time. It'll be on the news tonight. It'll be in the newspapers tomorrow. Every news source in the country will pick this up. People will stop searching if they read this article. Why should they bother searching for Elizabeth when they think we took her ourselves? [murmuring] [Chris] We have to release a family statement saying that we're cooperating with the police and that we will continue to do whatever it is they ask of us, okay? [machine crackling] [Man] How old are you? [Ed] I'm 46. In those 46 years, did you ever hurt anyone? I... I... I don't understand. You mean physically or emotionally? Just answer the question. Yes, I guess in 46 years, I've hurt someone. Is your name Ed? Yes. Did you take your daughter, Elizabeth? No. Did you kill your daughter, Elizabeth? No. You have no idea how to serve me. You mock me when you pretend to love me. That's not true. I've given my whole life to you. Perfect obedience leads to perfect love, leads to perfect faith. You're not worthy. Your soul is lost in vanity and false pride. Your role in this life is to serve me! I've done that! You know to disobey me is to go against God and to damn yourself to an eternity in hell? You know that? I've given up my whole family! I have followed you wherever you've led me. All I said was that I miss my daughter. She is your sister in his eyes, and you better get used to the idea. It's the plan... [continues] [screams] Where are you going? Nowhere. I was just... You know I have your house surrounded, don't you? You know they will all die if you are discovered? You'll never know who is part of me. You'll never know who you can trust. Now let's go home. You're a child who ran away from her parents. I'm the one who saved you, right? That's who I am... your savior. I will kill you. I will kill your family. They will all die. [echoing] It basically says that, uh... [clears throat] It says that Jim and David and Ed are part of a gay sex ring... that their wives know about it, and that somehow the sex ring is responsible for Elizabeth being taken. [laughter] What's so funny? It's just so ridiculous. No one's gonna believe that nonsense. They've gone too far. Unfortunately, the mainstream media will pick this up, so many people will think it's true. Oh! You're going to have to defend yourselves if you wanna maintain the support of the people. [scoffs] What do we do? We reject this malicious attack on our family. We will not respond to vicious lies. We, as a family, stand united in our faith and in our desire to find Elizabeth. [Reporter] One more question, please. Mr. Smart! Mr. Smart! [Reporters shouting questions] How come we get to live at home again? Well, we have to be here when Elizabeth gets back. Later, we're gonna go to the animal shelter and get a dog. I always wanted a dog. Yeah. You said we couldn't have one. Now we can. I wish I had my BB gun. I could've shot him. Honey, this wasn't something you could've stopped. Mary Katherine could've stopped him. She could've screamed or bit him. That's not true. Okay, your sister may have saved your life. She may have saved all of our lives. We don't know what that man would've done. And she kept watch over all of us, and she woke up Daddy when she thought it was safe. Mary Katherine is a hero. You know that, don't you, sweetie? I could've stopped him. I was too scared. You did the right thing. Do you think Elizabeth knows that? Yeah, I do. [Ed] Why wouldn't they be scared? Someone can come in here in the middle of the night, take one of them, and their father wouldn't even hear. [dog barking, distant] Tear it up. [paper ripping] [crying] [ripping continues] [crying continues] To the holders of Elizabeth Ann Smart and our friends throughout the world, it has been several weeks since our daughter, Elizabeth, was awakened and taken by force from our home. Every minute of every day, we search for her and pray for her and yearn for her to come home. So many of you have helped us in that search and in our prayers, and we wanna thank you from the bottom of our hearts. She's still out there, waiting for us to come and find her. Someone out there knows where she is. Elizabeth, be strong. We won't break our promise. [gasps] [laughing] We are going to find you. Bret Michael Edmunds, who was seen in the Smarts' neighborhood the week of Elizabeth's disappearance, was questioned by police in a West Virginia hospital. It was determined that Mr. Edmunds knows nothing about the disappearance, and we believe that this is a dead end. Thank you very much. [Reporters shouting questions] Guess what? [Kassen] What's that? Remember Richard Ricci? Worked at the Smart house. Ricci. Ricci. Oh, yeah. Tall guy. Didn't we bring him in for questioning, and his wife gave him an alibi? Yeah, they just brought him in on a parole violation. I think we should question him again. All right. Make it so. Thanks. Give up. You're not gonna find anything. You can ask me for 24 more hours, and the answer will still be no. I did not have anything to do with taking that girl. Okay, fine. Let's start again at the beginning. Your dime. I got nowhere to go. Sure you do, you heartless bastard. How about I throw you in with the general population and let them ask you where you put the little girl? You know I lost my own son when he was just 9? Don't tell me about heartless. You played that card, Richard. Where'd you go in the jeep? You took their jewelry. When did you decide to take their daughter? [sighs] Go to hell. We've arrested a guy on a parole violation. [Coleman] He was on one of your lists. He worked at your house for a long time. Who? His name is Richard Ricci. Richard... He knew all our children by name. We gave him a jeep so he could come and go. He knew the layout of our house. I fired him because Lois's jewelry was missing. Ricci's a heroin addict. He's got a record that goes back three decades. [Coleman] We found it when we searched his home. That's my bracelet. He's probably pawned some of the stones. Now, he's got a dubious alibi for the night that Elizabeth was taken, and, uh... Yeah? Two days before the night Elizabeth disappeared, Ricci took his jeep out of a garage where it was being serviced. When he returned it several days later, it was covered in mud, two of the seat covers were missing, and there were a thousand extra miles on the vehicle that he can't, or won't, account for. [Coleman] Now, we're analyzing the mud that was on the jeep, see if we can't figure out where he's been, but... So where is she? Where is Elizabeth? I'm afraid we don't know. He's not talking. [Coleman] He's claiming he's innocent. His wife, Angela, says he was with her the night... well, that night. Ed, Lois, I'm 99.9% sure that we have our guy. [sniffling] [no audible dialogue] [crying] [crying] [screaming] [dog barking] Mom! [screaming] How can you call it a prank? It happened exactly the same way as our house. The screen was cut the exact same way. She's my niece. How can that be a coincidence? Detective, [sighs] I... I... I don't mean to do that... tell you how to do your job, but it seems to me... I... I know, but... Fine. [beeps] It's like the police simply want to be done with it. Ed, maybe it is just a copycat. You know how crazy people are. And Richard Ricci is in custody. Come on, Lois. The screen, the knife. I know it's the same man. [gavel bangs] [Judge] The State of Utah vs. Richard Ricci. Mr. Ricci, you've been convicted of burglary and will be held pending sentencing. The sentencing will be set for August 30. Your trail for bank robbery has been set for November... Forget the robbery. Why isn't he asking him where Elizabeth is? They haven't even charged him with that yet. Excuse me. Mrs. Ricci? Please, I beg you. Please ask Richard to tell us where he was, what he knows. Does he know where Elizabeth is? Look, I know that you're hurting, but Richard was in bed with me that night. Where did he go in the jeep? Why won't he tell us where he was? Why does he keep changing his story? Honestly, I don't know. But I know that Richie would never hurt a child. Never. Please. I'll talk to him again. It's been two weeks. Angela doesn't seem to know anything. That's because Ricci hasn't told her anything. Well, maybe I could talk to him. I could plead with him as a mother. I'll see what I can do. Please. We could go to the mayor. He'd understand. He'd help us. Mrs. Smart, we have to go through so many official channels... At any time, our daughter could be killed! Do you realize that? Even now while we're standing here talking about it! I'll see what I can do. [paper ripping] [phone ringing] Mmm. [beeps] Hello? Oh. Well, thank you for telling me. [beeps] That was Detective Kassen. Richard Ricci suffered a brain aneurysm last night. What? Well, what does that mean? Essentially, he's brain dead. No. Then it's... it... it's... it's over. Come. Come here. [crying] I'm sorry you're so sad. I'm just tired, Mary Katherine. She's gonna come home. I know she is. It's too bad we have to wait so long. That's not the man that took Elizabeth. A-Are you sure, honey? I'm positive. But Mary Katherine just saw the picture, and she says it's not Ricci. Maybe he's not the right man after all. It was him, Ed. He was probably working with someone, but it was him. The police are sure. Maybe we should be following other leads. There are no other leads. Well, of course there are. I can't let this consume my life anymore. I have five other children who need me. They have to start school. They have to start living a normal life, and I'm never here, because I'm in press conferences from 4:00 a.m. to midnight. Do you wanna have a memorial for her? Is that what you're saying? No. I'll always have hope. But I'm so afraid, every time the phone rings, it's the police telling me they found her body. She's gone. She's just gone. I don't believe that. Well, I have to. For the other children, I have to. ..."and reserve a swift judgment against every worker"... [continues rambling] You are so young, and you know so little. But as you grow up, you will understand how lucky you are to be here, away from the sins of the world. My family's still looking for me. [chuckles] No. No, they stopped long ago. [firewood thudding] [Emmanuel] Stop crying. Don't be lifted up in pride. You should pray for forgiveness for holding on to worldy connections. Your only connection is to me and to God everlasting. Now come. Come, come. [chattering] I have to go to the bathroom. [scraping] I think there might be something to the call we got from Texas about the guy in the car. Ed, it's over, all right? Now, we have searched all across America. We've had dozens of FBI investigators work this case. We've brought in cold case experts, criminal profilers. We've done it all. You're just gonna have to find a way to let go. My daughter is alive, Richard. I know she's out there, and she's depending on me to find her. Well, it's possible that somebody that knows Ricci will come forward and tell us... Mary Katherine saw a picture of Ricci. She says it's not him. He was not the one in her room that night. I know Mary Katherine didn't recognize his picture, but it was late and it was dark. Look, Ed, I understand how you feel. I really do. There is no evidence my daughter is dead. None. She's alive, and I will not give up. With or without your help, I will never give up. [Ed] And we're offering a $10,000 reward for any information clearing Richard Ricci. We know that Ricci had someone meet him when he dropped off the jeep at the garage. We still stand firm in our belief that Elizabeth is alive. Mary Katherine, you hungry? No, thanks. How's the scrapbook coming? Really good. I've got something from almost every week she's been gone. I don't want her to feel like she missed anything. [chuckles] Oh, you're a wonderful sister. You know that, don't you? You know, honey, there's a chance that Elizabeth is in heaven with Grandpa. I know, but she's not. She's trying to get home. "Cry the Lord, and with you, I will stand by you." Daddy, I think I know who it is. Hmm? I think I know who took Elizabeth. It was Emmanuel. Remember that guy we met when we were shopping? That was, uh... The guy that came to the house to work on the roof with you. That was over a year ago? Yes. This is a new lead. This is who she remembers. You said, "Don't taint her memory," and we didn't. And her mind finally cleared. She remembered. She always said he was about as tall as Charles, which is 5'8". Ricci was over six feet. Over six feet. I get it, Ed. Look, you're just gonna have to trust on this. We are doing everything that we can. I don't know why you didn't have me make a sketch. I was on the roof with him. I remember what he looks like. Ed, I'm sorry. I just... I don't think this is going anywhere. Now, I'm gonna send a couple guys around the shelters to look for this, uh... Emmanuel. ...this Emmanuel. There could be a hundred homeless guys that do odd jobs. Mary Katherine doesn't remember a hundred men, she remembers just one. I know, Ed. We talked to her. Now, let me see what I can do. Okay. Ed, it's Peter Coleman. Listen, I've just met this artist, Darlene Neilson. Would you mind trying her out? Maybe you guys can come up with a sketch of the man that Mary Katherine remembers. [Officer] Attempted shoplifting. Calls himself Emmanuel. Doesn't have any ID, but gives his date of birth as sometime after the birth of Christ. [Officer on radio] Is he cooperating with you? Yeah, seems harmless. Then we got nothing here. No warrants. Roger. Let him go. Okay. On your way. May I help you? I'm looking for maps of San Diego and the surrounding areas. Yes. Maps. That will be in our reference section. Emmanuel will kill the rest of your family. He has followers surrounding your house. Are you two okay? Yes, we're fine, thank you. My daughter and I... we're planning on traveling south with my husband. He's... He's just looking at maps now. [Emmanuel] Thank you so much. Are you okay? Are you Elizabeth Smart? Her name is Augustine. She's very shy. Well, you folks have a nice day. Thank you so much, Officer. [Man] This is the final boarding call for Coach 63 to San Diego. Final boarding call for Coach 63 to San Diego. [Ed] Our Father in heaven, we are thankful for our family gathered together here on Elizabeth's birthday. We thank Thee for Elizabeth, for her spirit of love and kindness. We ask that Thou wilt watch over her and keep her safe, that she might one day return to us. We pray that the abductor might feel Thy spirit, and his heart be softened and changed that he might let her go. We do this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [together] Amen. I thought we could go around the table and each say something that we remember and miss about Elizabeth. I know that I miss her helping me make blueberry pancakes on Sunday mornings. [chuckling] I miss her reading to me. I'm old enough to read by myself, but it's better when she reads to me, so I can close my eyes and picture the story. [Man coughing] [chattering] [train horn blaring] [Emmanuel] On this day 15 years ago, Jesus chose you to come into this world. And it was then that He whispered to me that you would be mine. [Man coughing] [train horn blaring] Happy birthday. [chattering] [Man] Merry Christmas to you. [Woman] Yeah. [chattering continues] Get back in line. I want more food. Don't speak to anyone. I never do. Good girl. So your dad and I made each of you a memory box. We wrote each of you a letter telling you how much you mean to us. Thank you. And we put it inside of a box with some pictures and things we collected over the years. What about a miracle? What? It's Christmas. Maybe we'll get a miracle. I hope so, honey. [Emmanuel] On this day many years ago, a child was born. A special child that would die for our sins. Now I am here, as God willed it, to spread His word. Shall we pray? Having heard Your words, Father, and having understood your plan for me, I will be Your vessel in this world and in heaven beyond. Let us hold hands. I will call this shining soul Augustine. She will forever be mine and forever serve the Lord through me. Do you do so freely, Augustine? ♪ Jesus chose you to come into this world ♪ ♪ And it was then that He whispered to me... ♪ We sent people around to all the surrounding shelters, looking for this Emmanuel. We don't have anything in our database. There's not a whole lot more we can do. Ricci took her, all right? He may have had an accomplice, and we are still looking for the guy. You've been looking for him since October. Nothing's happening. What can it hurt to put out the sketch? It can generate hundreds of false leads. All our manpower looking for Ricci's accomplice goes on a wild-goose chase, we lose time and focus. It's frustrating not having answers, Ed. I know that. Let us do this our way. [scoffs] W... W... What... Richard... Hey, Ed? Do what you feel in your heart. Anyone with information about Richard Ricci is asked to come forward. The Smarts want to clear Mr. Ricci of kidnapping Elizabeth. Ed. Elizabeth, we are looking for you. We have not given up. We know you're trying to come home to us. We will never give up. Thanks, Ed. You can wrap that up now if you want. I think it's gonna generate some new calls. John, can I speak to you in confidence? You know you can. You know how grateful I am to you for calling us and putting us on your program. I know. I'll continue to do anything I can. Mary Katherine came to me in October, told me she thinks she remembers who was in her room that night. She said it was this fellow, Emmanuel, who worked for us more than a year ago. He was only at the house for a few hours, but she seems to remember. I had a sketch made, but Lois doesn't want me to go out with it because she wants to protect Mary Katherine. Have you told the police? Yes. But they say don't release it. It might generate hundreds of false leads. And if we put out a picture of him, it might scare him off, and he'll go underground. It's your daughter who's missing. She doesn't belong to the detectives working your case. You do what you think is best for your family. Thanks, John. I'll call you if I decide to go out with it. Okay. You say you have new information on the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping? I spoke with Ed recently. He told me his young daughter, Mary Katherine, remembers who was in her room that night. [Man] After all this time? She's the only eyewitness to the crime. I met her. She's a bright young girl. America's Most Wanted is going to take a look a look at this new information. Wh... What did you do? I told him that in confidence. Do you know what this means? This will take the spotlight off of Ricci. And what if Mary Katherine is wrong? W... We can't put her through that again. She's suffered enough. Don't do this to her. But...th... there's a chance. What were you thinking? [sighs] [beeps] Hey. It's late. You should go to bed. I didn't realize he was dangerous. I didn't realize he could be someone who could hurt us. He seemed nice. It's not your fault. Of course it's my fault. I'm the mother. I'm supposed to keep my children safe. You kept them safe. You did everything in your power to give them a secure home. Evil will find a place through a crack in the wall. There was nothing we could've done to prevent it. We go out with that sketch tomorrow. Really? I don't know if Emmanuel's involved or not, but we have to eliminate him as a suspect. Okay. There are good reasons why Richard Ricci is the top potential suspect in Elizabeth's kidnapping. He stole from our home. He lied to us. He never came forward with satisfactory answers to our questions. The Smarts are on a wild-goose chase. This guy... this Emmanuel... is just one of a dozen guys we're looking at. I don't blame Ed. He's just trying to keep the case alive. He's trying to keep Elizabeth's name in the press. There are, however, reasons to believe Ricci was not the person in the house that night. Mary Katherine described a man about her brother's height, which is 5'8". Ricci was over six feet. She said the man was familiar but not someone she knew well. Richard Ricci was in our home for months. She would've known him. Mary Katherine has come forward with this man. He calls himself Emmanuel. Our number-one suspect is still Richard Ricci, and we continue to believe that he is the one who took Elizabeth. We are not saying he's a suspect. He's just someone we'd like to speak to. Richard Ricci may have been involved in Elizabeth's kidnapping, but I don't believe he's the one who took her. [Woman] So where are you guys from? [Emmanuel] We're from heaven. We were sent here by God to do His work. There you go. Thanks. Do you have a bag? Yeah. [glass shatters] Hey. Hmm? What are you doing here? What's your name? Michael Jensen. Come on. Get up, please. Come on. Let's go. [camera shutter clicks] Relax your hand, please. Turn to the right. [camera shutter clicks] It's been days. Where is he? He would never abandon us. We will die without him. He's watching us. He wants to make sure of our devotion to him. It's a test. Oh, we are worthy of his love. We are worthy of his love. We are worthy of his love. We haven't eaten in days. I'm starving. Stop being so selfish. We are worthy of his love. We are worthy of his love. We are worthy of... Say it! We are worthy of his love. We are worthy of his love. We are worthy of his love. We are worthy of his love. We are worthy of his love. We are worthy of your love! We are worthy of your love! That evening in the church, Your Honor, was the worst night of my life. I got drunk for the first time in, what, 22 years? This last week, however, in jail has been for me like Jonah getting swallowed by the whale. It's turned me right around. I know what I need to do, what the Lord wants me to do with my life. And I'm... [sighs] I am terribly sorry. Nothing like this is ever going to happen again. Last week, we showed you a sketch of a man that might have taken Elizabeth Smart. Thanks to one of our viewers calling in, we've been able to identify him. His name is Brian David Mitchell. He calls himself Emmanuel for religious reasons. He is believed to be traveling with his wife, Wanda Barzee. Cops stress he is not a suspect. They just wanna question him in Elizabeth's disappearance. [doorbell rings] Yes? Mr. Smart? Yes. My name is Stacey McGinty. I'm a relative of Brian Mitchell's. Ah. Uh, please, uh, come in. No, thank you. I can't stay. I just wanted to come by and tell you... I don't know if Brian is the one who took her or not. If it his him, she's still alive. He doesn't kill them. He murders their spirit and takes their soul. Excuse me. Could you spare some change? Ma'am, some change? God bless you, sir. Excuse me, sir. Could you spare some change? Can you spare some change? [Man on phone] 911 operator. What's your emergency? [Woman] Yes. Is this where I call if I think I see that Emmanuel guy? The guy they're looking for in connection with the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case? Is he wearing robes? No, but he's got a big bushy beard and long hair. Is he alone? No, he was with two ladies, and they're carrying bedrolls. How long ago did you see them? I just saw them. You, can you spare some change? Sir, could you spare some change? Burn in hell. Excuse me. Would you happen to have some money for us? Ma'am, would you happen to have... No! [police radio chatter] Can you spare some change, ma'am? Can you spare some change? Burn in hell the lot of you. Good morning, Officer. Good morning. Mmm. What's your name, sir? Peter Marshall. Can I see some ID, sir? Oh, we're messengers of God. We're free of all worldly things. Simply traveling the earth spreading God's word. My wife Juliette, our daughter Augustine. [siren wailing] [car door opens] [bells tolling] Transients. He says his name's Peter Marshall, but he doesn't have any ID. Augustine, you can't say a word. You know that. Let's just relax. Hmm? Mr. Marshall. Can I talk to you over here for a moment? Absolutely. Ma'am, you, too, if you don't mind. She'll be fine. Can I ask your name? My name is Augustine Ann Marshall. I'm traveling with my mother and father. We're from Miami, Florida. Where in Miami do you live? Just Miami. Do you live near the water? Yes. Why are you wearing a wig? That's personal. Can you tell me your name? My name is Augustine Ann Marshall. I'm traveling with my mother and father. Do you have a place to stay? We're from Miami, Florida. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Can you tell me your name now? My name is Augustine Ann Marshall, and we're from Miami, Florida. So you don't know where in Miami you're from? All I know is I said is that we're ministers of God, and we're traveling to spread His word. You know, Elizabeth, there are a lot of people looking for you and missing you. [chattering] You're safe now. All you have to do is tell me you're Elizabeth. Thou sayeth. I sayeth. What's gonna happen to them? Will they be okay? The police just called. They want me to come down to the station right away. Why? They wouldn't say. I think they may have found Brian Mitchell. [door opens] [door closes] [phone ringing] [beeps] Hello? [engine starts] Yes, it is. This is Lois. [car departs] Uh, no. You just missed him. He... Told me what? No. I... I don't know. Charles! Elizabeth? [gasps] Is it... Is it really you? Yes, Daddy. Don't get your hopes up, Mom. We've gone through this before, and it wasn't her. I know. I know. Come on. Oh... Oh, my baby. [crying] I can't believe it's really you. [mutters] I knew it. [crying] [applause, cheering]
