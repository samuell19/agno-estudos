- Hello, Ed. - Where's Doc Holliday? Over at the hotel. He's been expecting you... Get word over there I'm waiting for him. No need to do that, Ed. The whole town knows you're waiting for him by now. Before there's another killing... Just go on serving your watered-down liquor. And keep out of my business, Shanssey. Your brother came in here stinking drunk, spoiling for a fight. - Whiskey. Over there. - He drew a gun on Holliday. Have it your way, Ed. Check your guns if you wanna stay here. Leave the bottle. You don't stand a chance, Doc. Bailey brought two men with him. Oh, come on, honey. Let's cut out of here while there's still time. The whole town, including that no-good marshal, is laying for you. Right or wrong, they're gonna hang you for another killing. You know it. Doc. Oh, you ain't even listening to me. Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey came all the way from Fort Worth... ...to see me on a gentleman's matter. A gentleman. Hmph. It wouldn't be hospitable for me to leave town, now, would it? Don't start that gentleman business with me again. It was a pure case of ethics, but... Well, that's something a person like you wouldn't understand. Why do you always have to treat me like I'm dirt? You ain't no better than me. - That's debatable. - Oh, is it? You and that magnolia dripping. Let me tell you something, Doc Holliday. All them fancy clothes and that smart talk don't make you no gentleman. You are dirt, just like me... ...and I'm tired of hearing about that Georgia plantation... ...and all them lily-white friends of yours. They're all gone now. They're all gone! Yes, they are. Here I am with you. Your family scraped the barrel after the war wiped them out... ...just to send you through dental school. Heh. You sure turned out fine. They'd be real proud of you. Don't you ever mention my family again. Oh, please... Doc, please. Forget about Bailey. Let's get out of here while there's still time. Maybe... Maybe we could even go to Laredo like you said... ...and do something about that cough of yours. It's getting worse all the time. Your concern over my health touches me deeply. You know how I feel about you. I know exactly how you feel. I don't know... I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you. You'd lose your meal ticket, wouldn't you? That ain't nice to say to me, Doc. I been good to you, ain't I? Why don't you think about me once in a while? All right, get over to Shanssey's and tell them I'll be there later. - Please don't go there. - Do as I tell you. I need some money. Hello, Wyatt. Cotton Wilson. Been a long time. Man, I'm plain wore out. Hope you got some good news for me. Ike Clanton rode through here three days ago heading east. Waco, I think. Johnny Ringo was with him. Rode through heading east? You didn't get my telegram? I got it. Why didn't you hold him? I have no quarrel with Ike Clanton. Nothing to hold him for. Nothing to hold him for? Why, man, he's got a dozen charges against him. I played this whole thing so he'd be forced into Griffin. I figured if there was one man in Texas who could stop him, you'd be the man. Now, don't go getting your blood heated up, Wyatt. Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp you're talking to. Ten years ago, I watched you walk single-handed into a saloon in Oklahoma City... ...and knock out three of the fastest guns in the territory. Ten years is a long time ago. Getting old, I guess. Anybody ever told me that Cotton Wilson had gone yellow... ...I'd call him a liar. - You got no right to say that to me. I've bucked heads with the toughest gangs on the frontier. Then why didn't you stop Ringo and Clanton? Why didn't you? If you can't handle it anymore, turn in your badge. Turn in my badge. I've been a lawman for 25 years. Worked every hellhole in the territory. You know what I got to show for it? A $12-a-month room... ...in back of a cruddy boardinghouse and a tin star. Think I like winding up in a place like this? It's the end of the line for me, Wyatt. It'll happen to you someday, just like it happens to all of us. Where is that yellow-livered skunk? Slow down, Ed. Holliday's only trying to rile you. What do you figure's keeping Holliday? Doc's gonna make them dangle a little. Wyatt Earp. Why, you old son of a gun. Why didn't you let us know you was riding into town? - Good to see you, John. - Hi, marshal. Come on. Sit down. Cigar? I'll be a son of a gun. You've sure come a long way since the railroading days in Cheyenne. Ellsworth, Wichita, now Dodge City. Funny, I never figured you for a lawman. You was always pretty reckless and wild. I never figured myself for a lawman either. Fix a nice steak for Mr. Earp. - Yes, sir. - My personal stock. - How are the brothers? - Fine. Virgil and Morgan are married. Virgil and Morgan married? What do you know? John, I need some help. Anything I can do for you. Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo rode through here three days ago. They got a dozen counts against them. I telegraphed Cotton to hold them, but he crossed me up. Cotton's skidded a long way. - You know anything? - Wish I did, but... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Doc Holliday played poker with them. Maybe he heard something. Bartender! Bartender! Let's have some decent whiskey around here! Ed Bailey. Doc Holliday killed his brother. The guy was begging for it. He came in drunk, cheated at cards. He pulled a gun on Doc. You ever meet Holliday? We crossed trails once. He was a dentist then. You know, I've yet to see the guy pick a fight. Trouble just naturally seems to find him. It's gotten so every would-be gunman on the frontier... ...wants the honor of putting him in Boot Hill. You know how it is when a man gets a reputation. I sure do. Where is Holliday? I better get to him while the getting's good. - He's at the hotel. - Keep that steak warm. I'll be back. You ain't missing much. It's longhorn. Holliday. Sit down. Make yourself at home just like you were invited. - I don't know if you remember... - Wyatt Earp. Pulled a tooth for you 10 years ago. If I knew when I had you in the chair what you were gonna turn out to be, I... Heh. I hear you've taken up a new occupation. - It's too bad. You were a good dentist. - My patients didn't like my coughing. I'd like some information. The name of this game is solitaire. I'm in a position to do a little horse trading. Good evening, Mr. Earp. I know something that would interest you. You don't know a thing that would interest me. Suppose I was to tell you that Ed Bailey... ...has a small Derringer hidden in his boot. - Left or right? - Left. I'd say that was good information. Bailey's left-handed. Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo rode through here three days ago. You played cards. Which way were they heading? - Beats me. - I thought we were making a deal. That's what you said. I didn't make any deals. - But you know where they went, don't you? - Look, you're interrupting my game. Got a real big hate for the law, haven't you? Any reason why I shouldn't? Your brother Morgan ran me out of Deadwood last year... ...and impounded $10,000 of my money. Hmm. As a matter of fact, you've got brothers marshaling all over the frontier, haven't you? I'll see you again, Holliday... ...if you're around. - What did you find out? - Not a thing. It's my hunch they headed for Tombstone. Ike's old man has a big ranch there. But I can't be sure. Isn't your brother Virgil a marshal at Tombstone? That's right. I sent him a telegram asking him to be on the lookout for him just in case. - What are you gonna do? - There's nothing I can do. The trail's ice-cold. I'm heading back for Dodge City in the morning. - Mr. Holliday. - Yes? Would you care to settle up your bill now? Uh, what I mean, sir, is we didn't know whether you were checking out or not. You'll have word in 15 minutes. Doc, you're walking into a stacked deck. If Bailey don't get you, the marshal will. You'd be smart to get out while you can. You act as if you wanna get killed. Maybe I do. Holliday, let's check your gun. Evening, Harry. The usual. Yes, sir. I understand there's a gentleman in from Fort Worth to see me. This gentleman should have taught his brother better than to deal with a marked deck. If you happen to see this, uh, gentleman, tell him I'll be waiting for him at Boot Hill. He'll have only one direction to travel from there: down. Come to think of it... ...he's no gentleman at all. He's a son of a yellow-bellied sow. All right, Doc. Let's go. Ah, right on cue. - What's the charge? - We'll think of one. I'm sure you will. Thanks, Harry. All right, get him out of here. It's all over, folks. Break it up. Come on, step up to the bar. Free drinks on the house. Give me some beer, bartender. It's always a mess after a killing. Looks like Doc spoiled everybody's fun. He's crazy, but he's got nerve, plenty of nerve. Shanssey, Mr. Earp, what are you gonna do about this? You saw what happened. They had no right to take Doc off. They're gonna do something to him, I know it. - Kate Fisher, friend of Doc's. - He's gonna be framed. You saw it. - Bailey pulled a gun on him. - Wait, Miss Fisher. Take it easy. Why don't you just relax and let the law handle this? Ain't no law in this town. I never saw a man beg more to get his brains blown out. - Please, you gotta help him. - Doc Holliday's none of my business. - Please, mister. - I don't want any part of him. I don't even like him. I'm sorry. Good night. Kate, I can have a pair of saddle horses put round back of the hotel. That's as much as I can do. With the feeling against Doc, I wouldn't stay in business 10 minutes... ...if they knew I'd helped him. Ten, please. - Wilson live here? - Why, no, sir. They're just holding Doc Holliday upstairs in his room. Oh. - Mr. Earp... - Look, Miss Fisher, I told you... ...this is none of my business. I don't care. There's a lynch mob starting across the street. That's your business, ain't it? Don't make no difference whether Doc is right or wrong. He don't deserve to be hung by a pack of animals. You're getting out of here. Since when have you taken to rescuing gamblers in distress? Don't take it personal, Doc. I just don't like lynchings. - What are we waiting for? - Not yet. I'd say now is a very good time. Hey! George's barn! That's it. Get going, down the back stairs. Much obliged, marshal. I'll see you in Dodge City and thank you proper. You can thank me properly by staying out of Dodge City. Whoa! How about that? Little out of place for Dodge City, wouldn't you say? That's strictly big-city stuff. Looks like she's gonna stay a while. Got a trunk. I gotta go on a posse. That's what I came to see you about. Chief Dull Knife is on a rampage again. - I'm gonna have to borrow your deputies. - You're always short of men. - Who's the girl? - Yeah, who's the girl? Girl? What girl? Oh. I was too busy finding out that Doc Holliday and his lady... ...just checked in at the Dodge House. Doc Holliday? I told him to keep out of Dodge City. I'd better get over there before he unpacks. You gonna lend me your deputies? All right, but I'll have to keep Charlie here with me. You can have the rest of the boys. Don't forget to get back before those cattle drives. You know how business picks up when the cowpokes hit town. Mario, go on out and get some fresh air. The mayor's welcoming committee, huh? I thought I told you to stay out of Dodge City. I like a sharp razor, don't you? Care for a shave? There's a stage for Abilene in the morning. - I want you to be on it. - Can't. The marshal of Abilene sent me here. Matter of fact, I wish someone would write you fellas a new speech. I've had the same one in the last five towns. All right, you'll stay in your hotel room until day after tomorrow. I'll personally escort you to the westbound train. Wyatt, we've got to face a hard fact. I'm in a state of complete financial collapse. I don't even have the price of a ticket. Shanssey told me you had quite a bankroll back there in Griffin. Shanssey ought to know. He had 10,000 of mine in his safe. Know what that son of a gun did? You recall I had to leave town rather hastily. Those two horses in back of the hotel cost me 5000 apiece. Now, how about that? Towel, please. Oh, thank you. Heh. Everyone puts such an outlandish value on my life. Say, Wyatt... ...how much do you earn, about 100 a month and $2 an arrest? - You trying to bribe me? - Oh, no. Not you. I feel compelled to offer you an honest business proposition. That's not bad. - You got any money saved? - Some. Wanna buy a small ranch or a country store someday, huh? Well, I'll make it easy for you. You stake me to $1000 and I'll split my winnings. The cowboys are coming and the stakes will be big. Fifty-fifty, huh? Actually, any number of people would be glad to back me for 10 percent... ...but I like you, Wyatt Earp. I like your cut. Why so generous with the split? Look, a barber needs this. You're a lawman, you need a gun. I'm a gambler. Money's just a tool of my trade. Of course you'll guarantee you won't lose? I never lose. You see, poker's played by desperate men who cherish money. I don't lose, because I have nothing to lose, including my life. Is it a deal? Of all the low-down gall. You're just gonna have to stake me to a rail road ticket. Holliday, I've done some foolish things in my life. I'm about to do another. I'm gonna let you stay in town. Why so generous? Let's say I like your cut. You can stay and you can play on one condition: No knives, no guns and no killings. No knives, no guns, no killings. That's it. You have my word as a gentleman. Just one more thing. You ought to treat that woman decent or leave her. Kate? Yes, poor old Kate. She stands for everything I hate in Doc Holliday. Oh, leave two bits for the barber, will you? I found out all about your lady fair. Hey, where'd you get the new gun? Buntline made it for me special. What lady fair? Sure beautiful. Isn't that barrel too long? No. Good balance, just right. What's beautiful? - Hand-tooled too, huh? - What are you talking about? - That girl that came in on the stage. - Oh, yeah, I remember. What about her? She's staying over at Mrs. Deeds' place. They tell me she's got a trunk full of the most elegant clothes you've ever seen. Some of them dresses clean from Paris, France. She's 5'6", weighs 120 pounds, red hair, green eyes... What is she doing here? Gambler. Very funny. Well, if you think that's funny... ...why don't you take a walk over to the Long Branch saloon? You'll die laughing. Hello, Wyatt. What's the trouble? Kelly, I'm gonna have to break up that game. Can't do that, Wyatt. There's no law against women gambling. I know, but every time there's a woman at the tables, there's trouble. You know that. - Sorry, game's over. - Wyatt, this is Laura Denbow. Kelly, you're the mayor of this town. We agreed there'd be no women gambling on the north side. Miss Denbow's marker is respected for $10,000 anywhere in the West. - We all consider her an exception. - Not in Dodge City she isn't. So you're the famous Wyatt Earp. Lawman, judge and jury. That's right, Miss Gambler. Start with you and we'll have every tramp on the south side over here. Who's a tramp? - Shut up and keep out of this, cowboy. - You're talking to a lady. It appears the marshal hasn't met a lady before. You're in a saloon playing a man's game. - Why should you be treated like a lady? - And you ain't no gentleman. - That's all for tonight, Miss Denbow. - Take your hands off her. Hold it, Charlie. I'm tired of you pushing people around. Now, go for your gun. I'm gonna kill you. I don't have a gun, cowboy. I'm unarmed. Stay where you are. You're drunk. You don't know what you're doing. Now, give me that gun before you get into real trouble. I don't stand for nobody talking like that to no lady. You stand real still. And just give me that gun. I ain't no gunman. I couldn't kill anybody. I know that, cowboy. You were just trying to impress the lady. Charlie, take him down and sober him up and get him out of town. You're under arrest. - For what, Mr. Earp? - You just saw it. Disturbing the peace. - Wait a minute, Wyatt. - It's all right, Mayor Kelly. The marshal's only trying to save the good name of Dodge City. Besides, I might like to see the inside of a jail. Don't you think you better wait for a few of your deputies? I might be desperate. I'll let you go if you promise to do your gambling south of the deadline. South of the deadline? No, I think I'll stay. Perhaps the judge isn't as righteous as the marshal. Well, aren't you going to open the door? Oh, I, uh, won't be needing these while I'm here. Why don't you buy yourself a new halo? The one you're wearing's too tight. Close the door, marshal. - Locked her up? - That's right. Disturbing the peace. - I could get her out. - Five hundred says you can't. Make it the thousand I owe you. Double or nothing. It's a bet. I'll be back in 30 minutes. - Good evening, Charlie. - Oh, hi, Doc. Man, this 12 on and 12 off is sure ruining my homework. I spend half my life on that darned paperwork. Care for a nip? Doc, you know Wyatt don't like drinking on duty. What's the occasion? I'd like to bail out Miss Denbow. Hit me. - I got 19. - Twenty. Can't do it, Doc. She's gotta appear in court tomorrow. No bail's been set yet. I think I'll stand on these. Twenty-one. Oh, I'll wait for Wyatt. I sure hope Bat gets back with our deputies before them cowboys hit town. - Blackjack. - I got one too. You know, Doc, if we was playing for real, I'd be compelled to have a look at that deck. I'd be compelled to ask you to try it. Use mine, huh? Good thing Wyatt don't let us go around drawing these. Somebody might get hurt. Well, I gotta go have a look at the prisoners and horses. - Watch the office for me, will you, Doc? - Sure thing, Charlie. - Never could get the hang of these things. - What are you doing here? Wyatt, I'd like to bail out Miss Denbow. She happens to be a lady. No favors, Holliday. Well, let's say you release her in exchange for some information. You don't know a thing that would interest me. Suppose I were to tell you that Shanghai Pierce is bringing his herd here. Shanghai Pierce, huh? I take it you've had some run-ins with him. I had to bat him over the head once or twice... ...when he got drunk and tried to shoot up Wichita. - Not a bad guy. Just forgot to grow up. - He's aiming to shoot up Dodge City. He's hired Ringo to make sure you don't spoil his fun. Oh, and what's more, he, uh... He's put a price of $1000 on your head, dead. What else is new? Well, I... Heh. I thought it was kind of amusing, a price on a lawman's head. Look, Holliday, as long as I'm the law here... ...not one of those cowpokes is gonna cross that deadline with a gun. I don't care if his name is Shanghai Pierce. Well spoken. I'll repeat those words at your funeral. - How about releasing Miss Denbow? - Nothing doing. Look, you made a deal. You made the deal. I didn't agree to a thing, remember? - Charlie, you're working for a crook. - Oh, yeah? Go home, Charlie, and turn in. I'll finish these reports. Thanks. Everything's quiet. - Good night. - Good night. Wyatt, you ought to turn her loose. She's got no business behind bars. I think Charlie's right. Let her out. - Conscience? - Maybe I like her. Tell Kelly she's to play in the side room. I don't want her gambling on the main floor. - Good evening, Miss Denbow. - Good evening, Doc. Come on, Laura, we've got business to take care of. Thank you. Marshal. - Good evening, Mr. Earp. - Good evening, Miss Denbow. Good evening, Mr. Earp. Pair of deuces. I'll check to the lady. - Fifty. - I'll stay. Too steep for me. - I'm in. - Fifty, huh? I'll make it 50 more. I'm in for the 50. - Doc, it's almost morning. - Queen of clubs. Jack of spades, three tens. - You didn't answer me. - Three deuces. - I'll make it 100. - Doc. Go buy yourself a drink. - And I'll raise you 100. - Too much for me. Two hundred to me. I'll call you. I'll go along with the lady. Four deuces. Gentlemen, we've been outclassed. Ha, ha. Thank you, gentlemen. I think I'll call it a night. Will you cash me in, Frank? - Good night. Good night, Mayor Kelly. - May I see you home? - No, thank you, Doc. Good night. - Good night. - Well, how about a little draw, boys? - I'll get my ante in there. - Good night. - She's a real lady. And lucky. That's true. Kelly, I need Luke Short. Ritchie Bell and two of his boys held up the bank at Salina. They killed the cashier. They're heading this way. I sent Luke to Abilene, Wyatt. I'm sorry. How soon do you have to pull out? Right away if I expect to pick up their trail. Doggone it, Luke's the only one in town who can handle a gun. What about Charlie Bassett? Somebody's gotta mind the town. You want a gunhand? You? No, thanks. I do handle one pretty well. The only trouble is, those best able to testify to my aim... ...aren't around for comment. I'll take care of it alone. Suit yourself. Hold up your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to uphold...? Oh, this is ridiculous. You're deputized. Grab some gear. I'll get the horses. Wait a minute. Don't I get to wear a tin star? Not on your life. Medicine. For a smart gambler, you sure play sucker odds. You're gonna be dead inside of a year. What do you know about odds, preacher? This kind of cough doesn't go away. Why don't you get out of those stinking saloons? - Pack up and go live in the mountains. - Not me. You're just ornery enough to live to a ripe old age. No, I'm not gonna let it drain me out slow. Sure. Play it hard and fast. Listen, Wyatt, the only thing I'm really scared of is dying in bed. I don't wanna go little by little. Someday somebody's got to outshoot me, and it'll be over with real quick. Earp, I didn't come along to hear you preach a sermon. You know, I've been wondering about that. Why did you come? If I stick around long enough, sooner or later you've got to put your head in a noose. I'm gonna bail you out. I've only got one debt in this world, and I don't like owing it to you. You don't owe me a thing. I've never needed anybody in my life... ...and I sure don't need Doc Holliday. You're pretty positive about that. As far as I'm concerned, you can get on your horse and keep riding. No, thanks. I think I'll stay. You know, Wyatt, you and I are pretty much alike, actually. Both of us live with a gun. The only difference is that badge. What's the matter, preacher? Don't you like being preached at? Shut up and go to sleep. Ritchie Bell won't be robbing any more banks. I thought you were asleep. No, it figured. Let's head back to Dodge. I wanna get in a bed. What for? They're not going anyplace. Neither are we. I'm getting some sleep. Get out of those stinking saloons. Pack up, live in the mountains. - Charlie. - Hi. I'll go in to fix up the coroner's report. Thanks a lot, Doc. You and I are even. Not yet. Not until the debt's paid in full, marshal. I hear you did some pretty fancy shooting, Doc. Well, it's all in a day's work for a deputy. You all right? Find Kate and tell her to come to the hotel right away, will you? Kate hasn't been around for a while, Doc. What do you mean? I mean nobody's seen her on this side of town since you rode out. Should I get a doctor? Morning, Laura. Oh, I never thought I'd be glad to see you. - Something wrong? - My horse has gone lame. Right forefoot. Hoof split. Better not ride him in. Leave him here. He won't go far. - I'll send the blacksmith out. - Nice you happened along. I didn't happen along. I know you ride out this way every day. Come on. I'll give you a ride into town. Unless you'd rather walk six miles. Better hold on tight. Tighter. Doc, what are you doing up this time of day? It's only 3:00. I'm on a health bender. Up before noon, take a 20-yard walk. What's the action here? I'm picking up the hardware as soon as the cowboys hit town. Sure don't look like Bat's gonna get back with our deputies soon enough. Where's Kate? Where is she, Charlie? It's kind of touchy, Doc. I... Yes? You promised Wyatt there wouldn't be any gunplay, Doc. - Now, you can't... - Where is she, Charlie? Wiley's hotel. Ringo blew into town, and Kate's taking up with him. Sure is a lot of beef coming in here. This is just the beginning. Wait till the... Look, Doc, a gunfight right now could cause Wyatt a lot of trouble. A lot of trouble. Sure is a mess of cattle here. Get out and stay out, you no-good tramp! And don't come back. Write you my mind My mind is to marry, love And leave you behind So you got homesick. Well, well, if it ain't the little deputy. You've been gone for three days. I didn't think you'd notice. You've been gallivanting all over the country with Mr. Virtue. I was sick, Kate. I needed you. Why don't you put a rope around my neck and pull on it when you want me? Can't stay away. Just can't stay away, can you? Oh, leave me alone, Doc. Always gotta crawl back to your gutter. Maybe I wouldn't if you ever noticed I was alive. What difference does it make to you where I go or who I take up with? Shut up! Get your things together. You're leaving. She's staying here. Keep out of this, Ringo. - You got no right to come busting in here. - I'm talking to Kate. Take a walk. Anything you gotta say, you can say it in front of him. - You slut. - Wait a minute, Holliday. You don't talk to my woman like that. Your woman. Anybody's woman. I'm gonna blast you apart. I don't have a gun, Ringo. You got one now. Reach. - I'm not fighting. - He won't fight. He promised Wyatt Earp he'd be a good little boy, ha, ha. I heard you made your reputation against a bunch of drunks. Go on, reach. I'm not fighting. Well, have a drink, then. Oh, Doc. It was a lovely dance. I'm sorry I have to leave so soon. - You're breaking a lot of hearts. - Ha, ha. - Good night, Mayor Kelly. - Good night, Miss Denbow. May I take you somewhere? No, thank you. It's just a short way. It's early and I have to ride out for the bluffs. Oh, it is lovely here. I'm glad I came. You've lost your poker face. You look like a scared little girl. I'm not scared. And I am certainly not a little girl. Why did you come out here with me? I wish I could answer that. I don't know. I'll tell you why you came. - Frisky bunch, eh, Ringo? - Yeah. This ought to learn them once and for all who owns the cow towns. Ha, ha. Yeah. Shanghai Pierce has hit town. His men are hurrahing Front Street. See if you can find Wyatt quick as you can. Get some help. I'll try to hold them off. I don't want anybody out there on the streets! Pierce, call off your men before somebody gets hurt. Tell your boss I'm waiting for his personal invitation. You're under arrest, Pierce. You hear that, Ringo? I'm under arrest. I heard. Sure are noisy. Sure are. Let's quit. I wanna get out of here. Just keep dealing. I'm not breaking this run. Hit me. - Doc, please! - Deal. Well, what have we here? A dance. Now, ain't that nice? You folks gonna invite us in? Ain't very hospitable, are they, boss? You better get that scum of yours south of the deadline. You hear that, boys? These are respectable folks. They're good enough to take our money. I say my men are good enough to dance with your women. My boys wanna dance! Piano player, make some music! Make it lively! - Hello, Shanghai. - Well, now my day is complete. You and me are gonna settle for this scar you gave me in Wichita. Unbuckle your guns, boys, and come down to the calaboose with me. You better start praying, Earp. You've pulled your last bluff. Think straight, Shanghai, before you get into too much trouble... - ...and can't get out of it. - Let's work him over, boss. That's a real good idea. Maybe your friends would like to see how tough you really are. I'd like to see you do a dance, marshal. That's mighty brave talk, Shanghai, with 20 men behind you. Let's you and me step out into the street alone. Oh, no. You don't sucker me into that. Can't bluff your way out, huh? All right, boys. Take the skunk. You gentlemen made such a racket, Frank Loving was too scared to deal. You busted my winning streak. Fun's over, boys. Unbuckle them. Let's shoot it out. All right, Shanghai? Go ahead. Draw, all of you. But you get it first, Shanghai. And you second, Ringo. Well, call the play. I'll give you five seconds to unbuckle your guns. One... ...two... ...three... ...four... We had enough fun, boys. Unbuckle them. Harry, Justin, get the hardware. Get moving. Doc! Anybody else wanna try their luck? Get moving. Come on! Keep moving, all of you! All right, Doc. We ain't finished yet. You would have been, but I feel in a charitable mood tonight. Keep moving. Come on. Kelly, take them down and lock them up for the night. You heard the marshal. Come on. Let's get moving. I don't suppose you want my thanks. Let's just say my account is paid in full. And don't take it personal, marshal. Morning, Doc. Morning. Just thought you'd like to know there's gonna be one less lawman in the territory. That's always good news to me. I'm heading for California, buying a ranch. I'm taking your good advice, getting out while there's time. Smart man. Laura's coming with me. We're getting married in a few days. We'd like you to come to the wedding, Doc, if it doesn't interfere with your poker. I'm not good at weddings, only funerals. Deal me out. Wyatt. She's a real lady. I wish you both a lot of happiness. You're lucky to be getting out of this country. Why don't you try your luck? Hmm. So long, Doc. Take me back, Doc. Please? Give me another chance. Please take me back. I'll do anything you say. I don't care how you treat me. Doc, I'm sorry for what I done. It's not your fault, Kate. It's not my fault. It's not anybody's fault. It's just the way the cards fall. I never gave you much of a chance, did I? Maybe it could have been different if I was right to you, but... it ain't too late, Doc. I'll be good to you. I... I promise. It's too late for both of us. Do something better for yourself while you've still got the chance. Don't let me go, Doc. Don't let me go back there. Leave me alone. Just leave me alone. I'll see you dead. - Hi, Wyatt. - Charlie. You got a letter from the attorney general. What's he got to say? He says he can get you an appointment as U.S. marshal any time you want it. Wyatt Earp, United States marshal. That's all I need. These are all dead, Charlie. Oh, before I forget... ...this is yours now. I'm through as a lawman for good. - Oh, you got a telegram too. - Read it. Virgil's my brother. He's in trouble. He needs me. Try to understand, Laura. I understand I was foolish to fall in love. - If only I could... - Wyatt, when I first met you... ...I told you I wouldn't follow you from town to town... sitting in the darkness, waiting for someone to bring the news you'd been killed. I won't live that way. We're not gonna start a life together with a gun in your hand. I swear to you, Laura. I'm through after Tombstone. You'll never be through. Your reputation will follow you wherever you are. - Laura, he's my brother. - And I'm to be your wife. - Don't ask me to let him down. - Don't let me down. I'd give up anything. I'll go anywhere for you. I'll work beside you in the fields. But you've got to meet me halfway. I must go to Tombstone. All right, go. Clean up Tombstone. There's a hundred more Tombstones on the frontier... all waiting for the great Wyatt Earp. Go on. Clean them all up. Go on! I love you, Laura. I love you, Wyatt. Good afternoon, marshal. Out for a little ride? About 700 miles' worth. Tombstone. Tombstone, huh? I'm heading that way myself. I understand the climate down there may be better for my cough. Since when have you gotten interested in your health? Well, it's really a matter of finances. The deck's gone cold here. Nobody will give me any play. Mind if I ride along? It's a free country. Hop on. Where's your gear? Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Well, thanks for the ride. Sell my horse and get a good price. Doc. I know. No knives, no guns, no killing. Man, that's good. I just about forgot what a home-cooked meal tastes like. Betty, I'm gonna steal you away from Virgil. By golly, Wyatt, you're gonna be the only single one left. I got a family going in Deadwood. Even little Jimmy here's tying the knot when he gets back to California. What do you mean, "little Jimmy"? I'll be 19 next month. Nineteen. Say, when are you gonna get hitched, Wyatt? Cigar? There's the signal for women and children to leave the room. Come on, Tommy. It's your bedtime now. Aw, Mom, do I have to? Yes, you do. Your uncles will all be here tomorrow. - Good night, Uncle Wyatt. - Good night, Tommy. - Good night, Uncle Morgan. - Good night, son. - Good night, Uncle James. - Good night, Tommy. - Good night, Daddy. - Good night, son. It's nice to have you here. I only wish it were under happier circumstances. She seems pretty upset. Well, she's been after me for a year to quit marshaling. You know how women are. All right. Now, let's get down to business. Now, Morgan and Jimmy know the setup here. Now, Wyatt, you know Ike Clanton has a ranch outside city limits. Yes, I know. He's organized the toughest bunch of gunslingers you ever laid eyes on. He owns the county sheriff. - Who is he? - Cotton Wilson. Cotton Wilson. So Ike paid off on his deal. Clanton's been rustling Mexican cattle by the thousands. And he has to move them. He can only ship them out of Tombstone, and he can't do that while we control the city. That's about it. He's organized, and he's mean. We can't keep him out of Tombstone forever. What about the people of Tombstone? John Clum, editor of the Epitaph... and some of the leading citizens will back us if they know you're calling the shots. We're all agreed, Wyatt. You should run the show. There's only one thing that bothers me... ...and I wanna speak my piece now. There's gonna be a lot of bad talk about you riding with Doc Holliday. What about Holliday? He's the worst killer on the frontier, that's what about him. It just don't look good, you coming here with him. Holliday saved my life in Dodge City. I don't forget that. What's more, he's a man of his word. As long as he plays his cards straight and keeps out of killings... ...we got no right to run him out of town. I didn't know you two were a team. We're not. It's just a case of square deal. Holliday stays. All right, Wyatt. He's your responsibility. That suits me fine. Do we have a map of the county? The first thing we gotta do is let the Clantons know that the city is closed to them. Then we gotta control the county. Now, that's important. I'm gonna get a letter off to a man tonight who'll take care of that matter for us. - Now show me where the Clanton ranch is. - Here. Where does he keep his men? Hello, Cotton. I've been expecting you. You're looking fine, real prosperous. - Oh, I ain't complaining. - What's on your mind? Wyatt, Ike wants to make you a deal. He promises no trouble... ...if you let him ship his cattle out of Tombstone. - Well, that's mighty nice of Ike. - Ike's a nice fella. He's got a fortune tied up in cattle out there at the ranch... ...and he's gonna move them. - Oh, he is, huh? There's $20,000 in it for you, cash. Twenty thousand dollars? The wages of sin are rising. Twenty thousand against a 6-foot hole in Boot Hill... ...or a $20-a-month pension if you live long enough to collect it. I've thought about those things. You know, Cotton... ...this is a nice little town, a good place to set a while. I might even run for county sheriff in a couple of months. That don't scare me at all. I got mine. I got a ranch now and 25,000 in the bank, and you know something? It don't bother my sleep, not one bit. It would mine, though. Why don't you get off that pulpit, Wyatt? Ellsworth, Wichita, Dodge City. What have they got you but a life full of misery and a woman who walked out on you... ...and the friendship of a killer? Take this message back to your boss. So that's the way he wants it, huh? He aims to pull the town out from under you, Ike. I immediately raised my hat And finally she remarked I never shall forget That lovely afternoon I met her at the fountain in the park - Been a long time, Ike. - Too long. Hello, Ringo. Still renting your gun to the highest bidder? That's right, marshal. Ain't you a little young to be packing a gun, son? Why don't you try me? Going someplace? We're taking in the show, marshal. Any objections? Nope. Soon as you check in your sidearms. Why don't you check it in for me, marshal? Now! You boys know my brothers. Meet John Clum, head of the citizens' committee. You're a marked man, Wyatt. There's no place in this town for you, Ike. The next time you ride in armed, you ride out feet first. Now, get moving. Hyah! - Here comes trouble. - Who is she? That's Kate Fisher. She just couldn't stay away. Call, you suckers. Barkeep, some whiskey down here. Leave the bottle. Two pair. Aces up. Hey, Doc, what have you got? Three treys. Nice town, huh, Kate? Well, well, well. If it ain't the little deputy. Doc, your deal. Ain't you gonna say hello to an old friend? Draw. I'll have some creme de menthe. Hey, little deputy... ...wouldn't you like to have another drink with me? You're drunk, Ringo. That's the way you made your reputation, wasn't it? Against drunks? Get your gun. I'll meet you in the street in five minutes. I'll be there. I said I'd see you dead. What kind of a sucker play is this? It's all Clanton needs to start a war. I've had it up to here. You wanna play patty-cake with them, go ahead. Give me your gun, Doc. You've got no right packing it. Now, you can... You can thank God you're Wyatt Earp's brother. Holliday, if you think anything about Wyatt, you'll get out of here. Having a killer like you around is the worst thing that can happen to him. - I hear you're leaving Tombstone. - You hear good. I'm taking the stage tomorrow. I thought this climate was good for your cough. Listen, preacher... ...being here's caused me a lot of embarrassment. Some people are even taking me as a lawman. You're not leaving on my account? Your account? You got nothing to do with my leaving. Good luck, Doc. Too bad we won't be in on the finish together. Hi, Wyatt. Here's that letter you've been waiting for. What have we got here? Young Clanton passed out drunk at the Alhambra. Throw him in the tank. Let him sleep it off. Hold it a minute. John, how long is it gonna take to get those men you promised? Any time you say. I think I'll take a trip out to the Clanton ranch. - Are you crazy? - I don't think so. - Take your gun. - This is all the ammunition I'll need. If I'm not back in a couple hours, Virge... ...have Clum's citizens' committee drag my carcass out. Whoa, whoa. - Billy! - He's all right, ma'am. Just got himself a little liquored up. All right, on your feet. Billy! You get in the house. I don't know what I'm gonna do with that boy. Way he's going now, he's gonna end up like his father... ...shot down for stealing cattle. You think you're pretty tough, don't you, son? I never saw a gunslinger yet so tough he lived to celebrate his 35th birthday. I learned one rule about gunslingers. There's always a man faster on the draw than you are. And the more you use a gun, the sooner you're gonna run into that man. You think I don't know what's inside of you. I had a couple of big brothers. They fought in the Civil War, and I was too young to go. I tried to live up to them the same way you're trying to live up to Ike and Finn. - You know about that, huh? - You can bet I know about that. It's not that I wanna be a gunfighter, exactly. It's just... I don't know, sometimes I get lonely. All gunfighters are lonely. They live in fear. They die without a dime or a woman or a friend. You know, I never thought about it like that. Well, think about it. Think about it. Billy, listen to the marshal. - I won't do it no more, Ma. - Oh, Billy. What are you doing here? Just brought your kid brother home, drunk. You should be proud, real proud. You better get riding. I wouldn't do that, Ike. My friends in Tombstone might begin to worry if I'm not back soon. That don't cut no ice with me, Wyatt. You're out of your territory this time. Am I? My appointment, United States marshal. Sorry to disappoint you. Now, wait a minute, Wyatt. I'm not looking for a fight, but you gotta stop pushing me. Why don't we sit down and talk it over? I'll make you any kind of deal you ask. The only deal I want is for you to run that stolen herd back to Mexico. Hyah! - Did you see the judge? - I seen him. Well? There's no legal way you can keep a United States marshal out of the county. The judge was packing up to leave when I got there. I think it's about time we all pack up and leave, Ike. Shut up, Frank. Only one thing we can do. We didn't have no trouble till that Wyatt Earp got here. You're making sense now, Ike. All right. We got no choice. We'll ambush him tonight. Ain't you forgetting about the rest of the Earps? Now, look, we can handle the Earps if we make this a personal fight. - What if they bring in Clum? - They won't. They're too proud. They're gonna come to us the way we want. It's a law, bigger than any law in the books. Family pride. We'll get that Wyatt when he makes his late round. Don't make no difference to me. Tired? Yeah. I guess I must have dozed a little. Betty sent some coffee. Well, that's gonna hit the spot. It's awful quiet. Too quiet. Wyatt, do you figure we're gonna have to fight it out with the Clantons? I wish I knew, Jimmy. Maybe Ike will see how hopeless it all is. You itching to get back to California? I think about it all the time. - She must be quite a girl. - Yes, she is. Well... ...I better get to work. Look, how about letting me make the rounds for you tonight? I get awful lonesome sitting here with nothing to do but think. Sure, you go ahead. I could use some sleep. At least when I'm making the rounds, it gives me something else to think about. Ike's called the play. We'll do it his way now. Don't do that, Wyatt. That's what they want. Don't let them push you into a personal fight. That's mighty funny coming from you. You're a lawman, Wyatt. Don't throw away a lifetime's work. - Where's your logic? - To hell with logic! That's my brother lying there. - Who is it? - Open the door! - Start talking, Kate. - Doc... ...I don't know nothing about it. Talk. Why? What difference does it make now? I sure messed everything up real good, ain't I? I wanted you back... ...because I love you. And I thought if Wyatt was out of the way, you'd come back to me. That's why I kept quiet when I... When I heard them. I must've been out of my mind. Where? The Clanton ranch. Who was there? - I didn't want that boy to be killed. - Who was there? Ike, Finn... ...Cotton Wilson and the MacLowerys. And Ringo? Was Ringo there? Yes. Ringo was there. Doc. - Don't, Doc. - Oh, please don't, Doc. Doc! Please don't, Doc. Please don't kill me. Please. Please! Please! Don't kill me! Doc. Doc. Doc. Doc. Oh, Doc. It's all right, honey. It's all right, honey. Wyatt. Ike sent me. I didn't have nothing to do with it. I didn't know nothing. You gotta believe me. I guess it's just because your name is Clanton. Ike sent me to see you. He wants to meet with you and your family personal. - I've been expecting it. - With no interference from Clum. You have my word. How many men is he bringing? Six. There'll be Ike and Finn and Ringo and the MacLowerys. Where and when? Sunup at O.K. Corral. You tell Ike we'll be there. You said six. I'll be coming with them. Don't do it, Billy. Give yourself a chance to live. No. I thought about it. I thought real hard about it. No, sir, I can't run. Ike and Finn are my brothers. You understand that, don't you? Yes, Billy, I understand that. How can you sit there like you're playing checkers? How can you sit there like that? What's the matter with you? Why don't you go to John Clum and ask for some help? I told you, this is not Clum's affair. This is personal, between us and Ike Clanton. But you're lawmen. You are lawmen, all three of you. You have no right to put yourselves above the safety of this town. Your duty is to the people, not to your own pride. Proud, proud men. Look at you. Look at the proud men. Morgan. Does your wife know she'll be a widow tomorrow? I think you'd better leave the room. Virgil, your son wants to kiss you good night. See you in the morning. Doc, wake up. Doc, it's me, Wyatt. Wake up, do you hear me? You drunken sot. I need you, Doc. Don't let me down. Wake up, do you hear me? Wake up. Leave him alone. Can't you see he's dying? Leave them alone. Doc. How do you feel? The fight's this morning... ...isn't it? What? I don't know. Doc, you can't. You can't. Doc, you can't. Look, you can't even stand up! You're gonna die for sure if you go out there. If I'm going to die, at least let me die with the only friend I ever had. We don't make no difference, huh? You and I? We don't matter, Kate. We haven't mattered since the day we were born. - Get the horses around back. - Right. Hyah! Get going, Cotton. Frank, take the rifle. Get inside the wagon. Up front. Morgan and Virgil are waiting. Ike wants to talk to you alone. - He's unarmed. - Wait a minute, Wyatt. Kate told me about the killing of your brother. It was the Clantons, all right. And you were in on it. - I had nothing to do with it. - Get back where you belong. - Believe me, Wyatt... - Get back with your friends. They're coming. They got Doc Holliday with them. Holliday, huh? Cotton, you get over with the horses. Ike, I can't take this kind of gunplay anymore. - Let me out. - Get over there. There's seven of them with Cotton. I only see six. Spread. Frank. Hit the dirt! Cover me. Shotgun! - Are you all right? - All right. All right. Cotton! You chicken-livered, miserable... They killed my brother! Tom! Stay back, you fool! Come on, Earp! I'll kill you! Come out and get it, Earp! Earp! Come out and get it! Virge. Hurt bad? Yeah. My le... My legs. Doc. I'll take care of Ringo. Billy. Throw down your gun and come on out. Give up, boy! You haven't got a chance! Come in and get me. Come in and get me! Don't make me do it, boy. Don't make me do it. I'm shoving off, Doc. How are the brothers? Coming along fine. They're gonna be all right. Another glass, Joe. I just want you to know I'd have never made it without you. - Where you heading? - California. Laura? I don't know. I hope so. She'll be waiting. Will you listen to me for just once? Will you get up to that hospital in Denver? At this rate, you can't last more than a couple of months. Are you crazy? And give up this winning streak? I'll see you around. So long, preacher. Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Hello, Doc. - Hi, Doc. What's the name of this game?
