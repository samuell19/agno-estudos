THE APPEARANCES Malo, look at the buggy. What beautiful! Didn't they ever take you riding in a buggy? Can you speak lower? Why are you screaming? No one else is here but us. Do you remember when you were little? Every year we went to the coast, to Lavandou, and she loved riding in a buggy. And we will too... It's better not to take the ring road, there's a lot of traffic at this time. It had been easier to get her into a taxi. Do you want to know? We will be around 25 people. Oh, sure, at your birthday party. Did you tell Henri about my idea? Mom, leave it there. I already told you that I don't think it's a good idea. What's the idea? He had told Evelyne... No, Eve, please. Oh yes, sorry. She had told him it would be funny that some violinists from your orchestra would come to set the mood. What he doesn't tell you is that he wanted them to come in wigs and jackets. Of course, we're in Mozart country, aren't we? Remember that Italian group from the 80's? Yea... Who acted masked. The Venetian Rondo? This. You could do the same. I find it humorous. Now you know why I didn't think it was a good idea to tell you. Yes. I don't think it's funny to ridicule my musicians. - I'm going to smoke a cigarette and I'll be right out. - He is well. Is Henri all right? I don't think so much... Much what? It is not alright. He's always stressed before concerts, but that's okay. He looks, takes out the passport. It's sublime. It's amazing. Which bakery? The one next to the museum? Yea! Their baguette is anything but a baguette, but on the weekends they make cheese rolls that are... a true delight. Look, it's always good to know. What does this one do? Magda, you can cut bigger pieces, we have more foie gras. - Oh, that's fine. - He is well. Because. He drives me crazy. Don't complain, you at least have one. What? Still haven't found a replacement? - Not. - It's too much! Why not that of the Panafieu? They were delighted. I had already thought about it, but she went back to Kraków. What a bummer. What were we talking about? Ah yes yes. How is Henri? Is he still nervous or...? Of course. Although it doesn't look like it, Henri has his insecurities. But then, he says that my presence comforts him at these times. And that seeing me in the audience reassures him. It's a bit like me and Thibault. In a sense, we are their compass. I think so. Shall we go to the table? I have to tell you something. It's not official yet, and Henri doesn't want me to say it, but they will renew it for another two years. Does that mean you'll stay in Vienna for two more years? - It is true. - But this is fantastic! - Yes, we are delighted. - I'm very happy! What I miss most in Vienna is good meat. Oh, I missed it. What about our meat? Don't you think she's good? It has nothing to do with good Charolais beef. Or from Salers. Have you tried it? For me the best is Aubrac's. Werner, when you taste a good spare ribs from Aubrac... Don't mind, Werner. What are you complaining about? When someone comes from France, you make orders for them. We had never had so many provisions for meat. No, seriously, we have the freezers filled to the brim. - In our case it's the cheeses. - Oh yes? - Do you freeze the cheeses? - Not. Henri has a passion for French cheeses. For example, my mother came and saw herself and wanted to bring us a huge brie. Which, by the way, love, you're almost done with him. Look, and your mother, we haven't met her yet. - Where is it? - Didn't stay long. But we want to meet her! Yes, next time. I'll see if he sent me a message. It's curious because he traveled with Mathilde. Do you know? Bertrand's wife, the Le Monde correspondent. Ah, I already know who Mathilde is. And I see that you don't know anything. About what? - That he left her. - Oh yes? He had been seeing an Austrian woman for two years. Also a journalist. That's why I was so... And she's going back to France now? She doesn't have many alternatives. Oh, poor thing. She told me that she went with him when he was a correspondent in Honduras. And I thought, "You have to be really in love." Yeah, you know Honduras. - Didn't they go there to get Malo? - Not. No, he went to Guatemala. But it's similar. It doesn't surprise me that this happened. I'll even tell you she was asking for them. Clémence, how can you say that? Because she was always stuck up. When we created the association, I didn't even want to hear about it. What does that have to do with her husband leaving her? I confess I don't understand, dear. We form a community. We are united. And if any of us felt that... Anyway, if we had known something, we would say, we helped each other. She made herself look important. "I don't need anyone, I don't accept invitations". And now she was left alone. Do you know? I am not so sure, that by being united, as you say, we are safe from danger. I think you're wrong. What Clémence says is that she and her group monopolize us with their dinners, openings, conferences and we don't have time to do anything else. Isn't it true, Henri? What a pair of nauseous. She said, "We did Morocco." Did they do it? I mean, they spent a week in a hotel in Marrakesh and that was it. - Can I have a raisin? - Yea. Clémence, is there still Apfelstrudel? Yes Yes Yes! I'm done. Take everything out ahead of time. Stay here, I'll go there. You are a sweetheart. Pardon. In Dublin I earned the same as in Paris. But in Ireland rents are more expensive than in France. Do you know where Henri is? I think it was to see the kids. And tell them about the mold in the houses. Oh yes, it is a calamity. The mold they have... Malo, do you know where Daddy is? Bad. You made a neat move. It will burn you a little. He is well. - He is well? - Yea. Oh, sorry, sorry! Thanks for coming to my rescue. Did you want me to play a nurse? No, but some compassion on your part wouldn't hurt you. Some sympathy for a little hit of nothing? Why didn't you say a single word at dinner? How did you not say? As soon as I arrived, you approached me like I was a FNAC salesman. I thought you didn't care. You're the hi-fi sound expert, aren't you? And then? Why are you silent? Nobody heard you all night. Unlike you, who make yourself heard. Are you awake? Eve, I don't want to bore you. Tonight? Tonight, Éléonore. How nice is that new color. Thanks. - This is for him. - Thanks. - Oh, Sophie. - Yea. Looks like we'll have Annie Ernaux in Francophonie week. - Great. - It's not correct, but he has availability, he likes to participate in these events - and would love to see the city. - Perfect. What about Amelie Nothomb? There are no news. I will forward an email to Albin Michel. What time is it? My God, how time flies. Well, I'm off. No later than 20:00? See you soon. Oh Eve! Oh, Mrs. Belin! - Such as? - Great. I brought some books that I wanted to get rid of. You already know Henri Troyat. I have two of his that are in perfect condition. I have one by Robert Sabatier. Let me see, which one was it? It's just that without glasses, I can't even see the title. Let me see. "Sowing and Reaping". A great storyline. Yes, it's magnificent. Excuse me, Mrs. Belin, they're waiting for me. Sophie gladly takes care of it. See you later, thank you very much. Hello. How are you? - Hello Bruno. - Hello, Eve. Wait for me at the door. Remember that you must obtain authorization to visit the zoo. Don't you forget? Yes Malo? Because if you don't remember, what will happen? We can't go. Is Tina nice? - You have to bring the authorization... -...ation! Go home! Bad, bad! Alright love? See you soon! Make yourself pretty, huh? It's 142 euros, please. Thanks. You're welcome. - Thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Choose a brighter dress... But with few balloons. A moon-colored dress, that's what it will be. Moon color? Hey, where are you going? Are you not listening? They're calling via Skype. Hi Malo. Goodnight. - Are you okay, my love? - Yea. What were you doing? I was watching Pele de Bicho. Again? You will memorize the lines. Hey, did you remember to say happy birthday to mommy? Yes, yes, yes, mother, she remembered. - Hello dear. - Hello. Look how beautiful you are. Are these the earrings I offered you? Oh no, not the earrings you gave me. - Did you have a good day? - Very good. Look, look what I found. Wait. Who is it? Mom, please leave those old photographs there. Because? I love this photograph. - Well, what about Henri? - Henri what? Like what? Is he more relaxed? Mom, while I don't do the concert, things are going to be tense. It's normal. Hell, what's up? Is the nervousness getting to you? How aggressive. No, it's just that you have a way of asking things. What way to ask? - Can't I ask how you are? - No, you can't. Now you're going to preach again that we no longer live in the same world. No, don't start, OK? Don't start, mother. Okay, I won't start, I'm too dumb to understand anyway. Have fun at your fancy party. You're completely crazy. But... When you're an expatriate... Okay? Are you missing something? Flawless. - The canapés are divine. - Yea. But have you tried the buns? They're fabulous. - This party is a delight. - Yea? It's just getting started. Be careful that the champagne is not cold enough. Yes. Your German seems to have improved. Because it is a language that I don't like at all. Here we have it. Forgiveness, forgiveness. Hello, my diva. Sorry, I'm moving, my shirt is soaked. I'll be right back, okay? We got to meet each other in person. All these apps are horrible. But nowadays, Sophie, life is not like in the books. - We have to adapt to the new times. - Clear. I speak with knowledge of the facts. I've tried it before and that's why I say never again. How have you tried it? Have you signed up for these sites? - Seriously? - Yea. - And it didn't go well for you once? - Not. They are married men who want to deceive the woman. These sites are veritable brothels. Look who arrived. Has no shame. What nerve. It's more than that, from what Mathilde told me. Oh yes, what? He's at his sister's house in a three-room apartment. - Not! - Yes yes. With a sofa bed that when opened occupies the entire room. How horrible. Oh, I'm glad you came, Bertrand. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - Meet Pamela. - Delighted. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm Clemence. - Hello. Nice to meet you. Sorry, sorry. She was sure there was a baton or two missing. And she said to him, "You need two batons." What an idiot. Let me through. Not... Go away, you'll ruin everything. I hope you like it. It's nothing special. "A Garden Over the Pond". Is the last. I use "A garden after the monsoon". - But this one has some citrus touches. - Yea. And at the same time it smells like vanilla, it's original, but I love it. Thanks! Thank you. Anything dear. - I loved. - Fortunately. Happy Birthday. Which is? Open it and you will see. You can relax for a whole day at the Hotel Kubinsky Spa. It was all refurbished. Oh yes, it looks fantastic. Yes it is. Look how lucky I am. Thanks. Thank you. Oh yes. - It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yea. Yes. - I can see? - Clear. They have mud baths. Oh yes? And look, there's a pool. MY LOVE, THIS MORNING I WENT CRAZY WHEN I SAW YOU HAVING YOU A DAY ALONE FOR ME... IS EVERYTHING I DREAM INBOX SEARCH FOR WAITING FOR YOU MY ADDRESS IS: HAHNGASSE 20 A glass of white wine, please. I don't have money with me. Can I leave you something and come back tomorrow? No problem, I trust you. Don't have a credit card? Do not. I left everything at home. It doesn't hurt. - Can I have your details? - Yes yes. Thank you very much, it's very kind. Another one, please. And charge the lady's expense to my account. Like? Do not. No, please. I am very ashamed. Don't worry. Seriously. It's my pleasure. He is well. Thank you. Do you have a foreign accent or is it my mistake? Make no mistake. I'm french. Oh yes. I've always wondered what the use of having learned this language was for me. Finally, today I got the answer. Jonah, delighted. Tina. Delighted. Are you here on tourism? No, I live in Vienna. Yes. Long time? Sorry, but I don't really feel like talking today. Thanks for the wine, but don't expect too much from me in return. I apologize. Goodnight. Thanks. I'm sorry, it wasn't very delicate what I just did. Sorry. Yes. Thanks. Do not apologize. I understand, I also came here to be alone. Oh yes? I wanted peace. Was it a strenuous day? Difficult. Yes. Yes, but I don't want to bore you with my problems. I imagine you have yours. Yes. We better not talk about ourselves. I mean let's talk but trying to forget who we are. Is it ok? I believe that for this, one drink will not be enough. For as far as I'm concerned, it won't be the last. Go, health. I proposed to go to my house, but... I live some distance away in Klosterneuburg. Oh, okay. No but... Let's stop here, it's better. Do you live far? Yes, yes, too. Then we say goodbye. Need the phone number? Yes. Don't worry, I'll take Malo today. Oh, thank you so much. Have a nice day, dear. Oh, good morning, Mrs. Monlibert. Do you need something? Yes. Is fast. I just wanted to tell you that I think he adores you. Oh, you know? It's reciprocal. Yes, that's the impression I have. He's always looking forward to seeing you. "Tina this, Tina that" How sweet. He thinks? For I must admit that it makes me feel a little jealous. For now, I'm supposed to be the woman of his life, right? - Absolutely, absolutely. - So it is. Oh, I have to go. Yes, don't be late. And that's all, I thought you'd be glad to know. Yes, I'm very glad to hear it. I wish you a good working day. Thanks. To you too. - Good Morning. - I'm still here. I'll be right out. I'm leaving, the door is open. Sorry, forgot about this. Thanks. Good Morning. What is going to be? I was here yesterday and... Hello. How are you? Oh hello, glad you're here. Do you remember that yesterday I bought some drinks to a lady who had forgotten her wallet? Yes. AND? We spent the night together. And she wrote down her phone number on a paper. And I accidentally threw it away. And since she left us her data, she thought of coming here. - Exactly. - Charlie, pass me the notebook, please. Isn't that a little young for her? I hope they invite me if one day they get married. I promise you. Bestial! Thank you very much. Her name is Tina. I don't know the nickname. - What did you say? - Said her name was Tina. Do not. It's not the name she wrote. Sorry, I can't help you. But this is absurd. Look, I have her handkerchief. How do you want it returned? So sorry. Are you kidding? Just give me the phone number. What if she lied to you and she doesn't want to hear from you again? It makes no sense. Who do you think you are? Give me the fucking phone! Look! Get out of here! You don't mess around. And you will have to apologize when I come here with her. Big cow! How could you be so stupid?! Incredible! Would you like some bonbons first? No, thank you. Oh yes, first I wanted to show you our magazine. Yes, I already know her. I usually read it. You already know that we distribute it here. Oh yes, yes, what a fool. Then you know it's monthly, it's free, and the articles are written by volunteer journalists like me. Very well. Well, let's get started. First, thank you so much, Eve Monlibert, for agreeing to do this interview. She is known as the wife of the illustrious Henri Monlibert - who runs the Konzerthaus. - Indeed. They are the parents of little Malo, who is five years old. Six. Now go to primary. Okay, six years. And they live in a magnificent apartment on the prestigious Rooseveltplatz. My question is the following: How do you manage so much happiness? Can you keep your feet on the ground? It is true that I feel cherished by life. Just a moment, it looks like it's not recording. First, thank you so much, Eve Monlibert, for agreeing to do this interview. TESTS ARE DELAYED Okay, I think it's done. Pardon. Where were we going? Yes. She told me that she felt cherished by life. Yes, completely. What misery. I don't even know where to start. The bed. A chair. The table. The mirror. YOUR DESTINATION: HAHNGASSE 20 Are you sure your wife doesn't suspect anything? Why do you ask me this? Because she came to me this morning and, I don't know, it seemed strange to me. And now you tell me? - What did you want to talk about? - From Malo. Who adores me, who never had a teacher like me. Good, then it's okay. Do not suspect anything. I never had a teacher like you either. Thanks. Mom. What are we doing here in the car? What do you say, love? Where will we go? We came for a walk, but we'll be right back. Go back to sleep. Are you still awake? I am, as you can see. Such as? Well. Yea? Did rehearsals go well? All right, I think we're ready. The truth is... that this show took us away quite a bit. Honey, this isn't the first time work has absorbed me. Certainly. But this time, I don't know, it's different. I feel very distant. No, look, I'm here. I'm with you. I wanted to tell you that... I don't know, we do things one by one. - We don't share anything anymore. - What are you talking about? The day before yesterday we had dinner at Thibault and Clémence's house. Yesterday we celebrated your birthday in a big way. - What is the problem? - Well, Henry... What it was? What it was? Why don't we adopt again? What you say? You know, now the procedures will be much easier. But why? Aren't we all three okay? Yes yes. We are wonderfully well. Listen, tomorrow is the premiere. I need peace of mind. I'm going to sleep and we'll talk about this later. It's out of battery, I have to charge it. Koala. Ko... Kosovo. Shit. Ko... Ko... Ko... Ko... Kos. It was beautiful. Kosmetik OK. MY LOVE, I DON'T WANT US TO CONTINUE TO HIDE YOU JUST LEFT AND I STILL HAVE YOUR SMELL. TINA Was her. An e-mail? That's weird. That's it. I made tea. Do you want? Yes. I am? What? But what do you say? No, it must be a joke. I do not believe. Wait. Looks like every parent in the class got an email tonight from Malo's teacher that was not for us. Yes. A love email, says Clémence. Wait. Yes, let's confirm. Come on, Henri, come see if we got him. Henri, why are you waiting? Come on. I'm going. Yes, I'm getting to the computer. Wait. Yes, we received it too. See if you also received it in your email. Wait, Clémence, if I understand correctly, it means that you have an affair with a father at school. They will rave about this story. Did you get it too? "Crossing without touching is better than nothing". But what is this? It sounds like the lyrics of a pop song. And well, let's be honest, it's not a pattern, this Tina. Seriously? Of course it's serious. She is always poorly dressed, very provincial. What do you say, Clemence? Yes, it's true, she always has oily skin. You are really gangsters. Have nothing better to do? Clémence, I take my leave. Malo just woke up. Chat later. A kiss. How are you, kid? This story is astounding. So stupid, that girl. Do you want to take Malo, or would you rather it be me? No, you go. You want to be in the front row. What did I do with my keys? Oh, here they are. I'm done with the phone. Well, regarding Miss Brunner, I opted to give her the day off. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll let the other teachers know so that they can distribute your children among the different classes. Clear. Just one thing. Let's hope Tina pulls herself together, but what will it be like when she gets back? What you mean? What happened is not irrelevant. Does she think to give us an explanation? Are you going to send us another email? She can do whatever she wants, but she starts talking and the atmosphere can become very tense. So I think that someday she will have to tell us her version of the facts. I agree. There is nothing worse than these rumors. The harm is done. This will be an untenable situation. My proposal is that we get together and that Tina tells us who this email was originally intended for. That easy? I have nothing to fear, neither does Eve. - Not. - Servane, I don't believe it. But... There may be mothers who begin to question themselves, begin to suspect. You have to reassure them, so that they sleep well. Sorry, Clemence. I totally understand what you're saying, but... I think we're giving too much importance to this story and... Above all I want to think about the children and I think that for them... it is better that we forget this story. Wait, Eve. I don't know if I understand you. You're saying we turn the page and that's it? I think this mistake will serve as a lesson for you. At least, I hope so. I think that father will have already put an end to her judgment, and it may even be that at this time, he has already left her. It's not worth slaughtering her anymore. I don't want to crush her, I just want to understand. She is an adult, has responsibilities to children and parents. Say what you have to say and everything will be back to normal. Give me the other hand, please. Sorry? - The other hand. - Oh, yes, sorry. The new lovers of Paris... Do you speak French? More or less. Not as well as I would like, but I really like French culture. Ah, so you must come tonight. IT'S... The entire French community will gather. The library director's husband is the conductor of the orchestra. He is world famous. Do you play some instrument? Any musical instruments? Oh no. Am sorry. When I was younger, I learned to play the harp. The harp. Oh my, this suit has some wrinkles. Where? Why do you tell me that even before you go on stage? No, sorry, sorry. It's not that bad. You always do the same thing. And the rancid smell of this place is unbearable. Yea! Sorry to bother you. Hi Eve. Hi Jan. - Sorry, I'll come later. - No, no. Can you leave us? Oh yes of course. In the end we play Massenet? No, Saint Saéns, we play Saint Saéns. - I'll be on my way. - He is well. I just saw the maestro, he's getting ready. Fantastic. Tomorrow, meeting at school. All parents are invited. - You must have gotten the message. - Oh yes. But the kids don't have to go, do they? Oh no, no, no. We share them or let them play in the yard. I wonder who will be elected. Do you think he's going to tell us his name like that, openly? Well, I don't know. But it may be that they are prepared to assume it publicly. Oh no, please, not her. She hides me. It's Mrs. Belin. If she sees me, she won't let go of me. - Look, girls. - Yea. I found out that the person involved could be... Bruno Pillet. With Tina? -She is Simón's father. - So it seems. How did you know that? It was Tina who told me when she left me. You are so silly. Just seeing. Hi Eve. - Oh, hello. - Hello. I wanted to tell you... Wunderbar. Thank you very much. What is the last piece called? It is "The Carnival of the Animals" by Saint Saéns. - Do you know Camille Saint-Saens? - Yea. Have a good night. Thanks. Well, I'm off. Thibault is waiting for me. - Do you accept a ride? - No, I have to go see my musicians. You, what do you prefer? Do you want to go or stay? I think it's best to go. Because of the babysitter. Congratulations. Oh, I can't stand these heels anymore. And then? Did everything go well? Yes, very good. Before falling asleep, he said something strange, but... - Oh yes? What? - No, nothing... Anyway... He asked me if we were going to the car as he didn't want to sleep in the car. But he fell asleep right away. Oh, how strange. Let's see... Here. Here you go. Listen, aren't you afraid to go back alone? No, here in Vienna it's calm, I'm not afraid. He is well. Okay? Okay. Go back to sleep. Why did you turn on the light? Because I wanted to admire you one more time. It was magnificent. And you were magnificent. And the suit suits you very well. Thanks. In fact, I received many compliments. - Do you know who was there? - Not. The director of the Leipzig Festival. He wants to hire me in September. But that's great, isn't it? But it will be with his orchestra. And I only know metals from Berlioz's Requiem. - Have you heard? - Yes, I heard, of course. I can already see that I have to listen to others to get an idea. But... Where do you have to go to listen to them? - Leipzig? - To Leipzig. The idea is to go with him on the return plane tomorrow night, I listen to them the next day, and then I come back. Oh, okay. I understand. Yes. Indeed, time is pressing. September is at the door. It's the easiest way. I have to know whether to impose my orchestra on you or not. Is important. Do you understand? Yes, yes, of course. I understand perfectly. Well, I like to see him in a tie. It looks very beautiful. Looks like a broker. Now the scarves also come in the mail. What? I don't know. Bad, wait. You have the backpack open. Whatever. No, not so much. Ready... I ask you for a little patience. She told me she would come. She texted me last night, I don't see why she wouldn't... Oh, speaking of the Devil... Sorry, since they changed direction on Hermannstrasse it's a drag. Yeah, well, come on, Tina. We were getting impatient. Very well. Please reassure us all. Well, I won't beat around the bush. The email they received, which could indeed cause confusion, it's an excerpt from a novel I'm writing that isn't based on real events. I assure you. And as every time I write, I have the habit of sending it to myself by email, to make sure it doesn't get lost, in this case it happened that, inadvertently, because it was very late and I was tired, I sent it to the parent group. That was it. Sorry, but... it seems unbelievable. We met her as a teacher and now she is a writer after all. You will understand that we are perplexed, to say the least. I understand perfectly, Mrs. From Gourmay. I understand that this email has created confusion, but, you know? I've always had a very creative nature. There isn't a day that I don't write. I have many notebooks with drawings, with poems, with songs... And since I arrived in Vienna, I feel like... possessed by the universe of this city and perhaps by the ghosts of the artists who were here. Egon Schiele, Stephan Zweig, Kokoschka, all this... You will see for yourselves why I brought you the manuscript I am currently writing. - It's a little early, but... - No, no, wait, Tina. Keep that, no one asks you to... Seriously. Thanks. Well I wanted to add that I was also perplexed when I received this email. I immediately contacted Tina, who... I can say it, can't I? She was crying. She was completely desolate. Including, I must confess... I feared for her health. Finally, between sobs, she ended up telling me about this misunderstanding. Hang on. She is telling us that yesterday she already knew that this message was an excerpt from a novel... - No... - Yes... Anyway, not me, I... Poor Tina was crying so hard it was hard to make out. Excuse me, but in that case, I'm sorry, Jean-Julien is right. Why didn't he try to reassure us right away? Anyway... Why did he let suspicion sow? There's something that doesn't fit in this whole story, but... Mrs. De Gourmay, what doesn't fit here is that I'm a nonentity in information technology and that I made a ridiculous figure... Sorry. - Am sorry. - Tina, Tina, calm down. Well, I think they already had the explanation they wanted. - Yea. - Come on, Tina. Here. A cleanex. Ready. Well, before you leave, I wanted to inform you that I thought it convenient that Tina won't be back at school until the next week. So that she can rest, to come back recovered. And, above all, free from any suspicion. - My God, what a waste of time. - Is not? I have to go through the Konzerthaus. - Shall we see each other before I leave? - Hope so. It's not easy, is it? I didn't like being in her shoes. Yes, in fact it must not have gone well. I know you weren't much in favor of this meeting. I think, unfortunately, it was hard to avoid. - Clear. - Let's hope everything goes back to normal. Do you know if Tina is going out of town to rest? No, I don't know. But you're right, it did him good. I like this girl a lot. I remember when I met her, she told me that she had gone through a very difficult phase. Oh yes? Then? I don't know for sure, but I remember casually asking him if it was for some love issue and she replied to me, it stuck with me: "No, it's more serious than that." - "More serious than that". - And I didn't delve deeper. But that would explain why he came to Vienna, a way to leave his life behind. I'm sure writing this novel helps her forget. Yes, probably. The idea would be to restructure this area. Yes, but in this case... Look who is here! How are you? I didn't see you yesterday at the concert, did you come? Yes, yes, it was fantastic. I had told him. Imagine that the wife of Henri Monlibert, the conductor of the orchestra, is Eve, the director of our library. If I had already told you, sorry, at my age we repeat ourselves a lot. - Come, I'll introduce you. - Not. No thank you. Come on, there's no problem. You'll see, she's a very nice woman, she's... What did she say her name is? Jonah. Jonah. It's not a very common name. Tell me, Jonas, have you signed up for books at the library yet? Because it is by reading books in French that you can truly progress. George Sand. I think George Sand is very good at learning French. Eve. Sorry. I wanted to introduce you to Jonas. Come closer, young man, don't be shy. It's just that Jonas is interested in French and, on my advice, went to see your husband last night. Formidable, formidable. Sorry, but I was running errands with Sophie and... We continue later. I have to go anyway. - Don't have time to sign up? - Not. But I will be back. Well... What do you want? Tina. Oh no, sorry, Eve. But maybe you'd prefer I call you Mrs. Monlibert. Great, you found me. What's your game? I don't play anything. I was sincere. Why did you lie to me? But what are you talking about? We spent one night together, and then what? - I didn't have to tell you everything. - Yea. Because you've been making fun of me. You made me very sorry. Aren't you exaggerating a bit? That night I told you I wasn't very well. I was bad too. Very bad. But I told the truth. And I didn't lie to you about my name. And today I forgive you. Well, it's a relief that you forgive me. But now unfollow me, okay? And if I want to see you again? I think we still have a lot to live together. Jonas, don't make me repeat myself. Unfollow me. Well you see I'm a married woman, I'm not available. And the night we spent together, if you can call it a night, I personally have already forgotten it. As you wish. So goodbye. You put on another handkerchief. Yes, I have several. Well I have to go. I saw the weather forecast for Leipzig and it's going to be awful. I won't be outdoors much. Yes, I imagine. I haven't used this for ages. Oh yes... I also saw that in Leipzig they have a pastry specialty called "alouettes" Oh yes? Indeed, when the King of Saxony prohibited the hunting of these birds, all the bakers in town created a cake with the same shape made with puff pastry and stuffed with almond paste. I see that Francophonie week is going well. No, I just thought you could bring Malo one, I think he'd like it. Yes I will try. And for me, I don't know. A jewel? Malo, come to dinner. - Olivia! - Olivia! Hello, we are friends of Olivia, we brought drinks. - Would you open, please? - I'm going! OK thank you. - Mom. - Yea? Why are you dressed like that? Well, because... I also have the right to wear a moon-colored dress. What you have? Don't want to go to a hotel? The idea of ​​leaving dry land doesn't appeal to me. - We will be isolated from the world. - What's wrong? It's just for one night. It's exciting. It's like we're going to board the "Love Boat". I see you've recovered from so much emotion. Yes, of course, you're absolutely right. Give me a kiss. I have good news for you. It concerns you. Well, the two of us. - Are you pregnant? - Not. At all. What nonsense. - Which is? - No, let's do it right. We'll settle in and I'll tell you with a glass of champagne. He is well. Go. Your Juanito. And a big kiss. Good night, my treasure. You know Malo? Your father and I will never part. Never. Who is this Bettina Lebrun? Do you know who my friend Hilde is? The Flemish woman, who works in Vienna, at the Berlitz Institute. Oh yes. Anyway, I went to her house this afternoon to tell her how I got around this whole story, that I am now a writer, we drink coffee and meanwhile she showed me pictures of an apartment on her iPhone. Because you want to buy a two-room apartment in the center, a little deteriorated, but beautiful. I was looking at the photos and I see photos that she took in a bar with friends and it happens... - What? - You'll see. Outside the bar... Who do we see? It's Eve. Well, my dear. We have clear evidence that your wife has a lover. And very cute, by the way. And then? How does it feel to be a free man? How do you feel being able to forget those nonsense that your wife is exemplary, upright? We are free, Henri. DEATH OF LITTLE NIL: FILE FOR BETTINA LEBRUN I do not believe... CHARGED WITH NEGLIGENCE FOR THE DEATH OF FIVE-YEAR-OLD NIL YOUR COMPANION'S DAUGHTER, BETTINA LEBRUN USED THE ARCHIVE If 30 seconds ago there was no network, there must still be none. Sorry? Nothing. Who do you try so hard to locate? Your wife? Do you miss her? Do you like your wife to fuck with other guys? Tina, please. I just want to understand. Since I showed you the pictures, you haven't said anything. Are you afraid I'm leaving you? Is your virility injured? Enough. What it was? Tell me. She still turns you on. - That's it? - For. It gives me time to settle ideas. I'll call you. You have three new messages. Message received today at 7:12 pm Tina, call me when you can. What's this about a deadly fall? She calls me. Message received today at 7:46 pm Tina, I think I was very understanding when you changed your name, but now I'm waiting for an explanation. Message received today at 8:27 am Bettina, the parents came to me. They're asking me to fire you. I told them you were never kicked out of the education system but they don't want to accept it. I can no longer defend you. But what are you doing here? Are you following me? - Were you the one at the party? - Which party? Wait, Eve, please listen to me. I followed you because I know you don't want me to go to your job. But I have important things to tell you. Do you hear what you say? I saw it. I saw Henri. What? Did you speak? Of course. Do not worry. But he doesn't want you, like I want you. You're completely crazy. You put on our handkerchief. You left him on purpose, didn't you? The new lovers of Paris. We can live together if you want. We won't be rich, but I'll get work. Enough! I don't know you. Leave me alone! Do you understand? Why are you so aggressive? It could be very sweet, very tender. I do not want you! I do not want you! And if you keep this up, I'm going to file a complaint. For that we had to get to know each other. But you say we don't know each other, that our story doesn't exist. What nonsense. I've never seen anything like it. No, if you loved me, you would have told me that sordid story. There is no justification. Of course. Your email? I'm glad they hacked it. At least now I know what's going on. Listen, this has to stop. Henri! These here? Yes, I'm on the piano. Then? Where have you been? In the spa at the Kubinsky hotel. I went to relax, it did me a lot of good. And you, how was Leipzig? A beautiful orchestra. It will work. But you didn't have to come back so soon, did you? Because? Do I disturb your plans? Do not. No, no, not at all. No, it's just that you told me that... He had no reason to stay in Leipzig. By the way, I didn't even have time to go shopping, I'm sorry. I was impatient to see you. Are you expecting a call? No, no, no. Must be a guy who insists on selling me an equipped kitchen. I don't know how we got into his database. But it can also be for you. If it's for me, it's Susan who wants sheet music. And I don't want to be disturbed. Me neither. Look, my love, I found you Fourme d'Ambert, Take aux fleurs, Feuille du Limousin, Camembert and Morbier. I love Morbier. - This deserves to open a good bottle. - Yes No doubt. Okay? You are enjoying? Nobody answer? Yes sure. I am? - I am? - Shit! I'm a klutz, sorry. You are excused. It's this one? What is your name? - Go. - It's a cello. And this is... - This one is bigger. - Yes, exactly. - It's the... - Double bass. It's hard, huh? Go to sleep. Mama, look what they gave me. How cute, it's an octopus. Eve, wait. Let me tell you, I read a passionate novel that I got from a friend in France and that you have to get. It's a little spicy, but absolutely delicious. Why not write it down in our suggestion book? You know that we consult you monthly and take your ideas into account. I am very honored and I return your consideration because I do a lot for your institution. Yes, it's very kind. For example, just a moment ago, I had Jonas sign up. Do you remember? That charming young man who wanted to improve his French. Yes, I remember. He returned? Yes, and he told me he hadn't signed up yet. I immediately dragged him to reception. So now he already has a membership card. What would you recommend to someone who wants to improve their French? Sorry, I have to make a call. See you soon. bother? No, on the contrary, how good. I've been to the Prueckel cafe. Since I have some free time, I thought we could go to dinner. Astrid can go get Malo and look after him. Good... You already have everything programmed. Is not? If you'll excuse me, I have some work. OK. I'll come get you later. He is well. Jonah? This is Eve. I have to see you, please. No, to speak calmly, to understand each other. Ah, no, no, not in your house. No, not even mine. Not at my job. Well, in a quiet place. I don't want them to see us. On the banks of the Danube is perfect. No, I have GPS, I'll find out. In half an hour. All right, see you soon. Jonah? Jonah? Jonah. Jonah. Have you seen how beautiful? I love this site. Listen, I don't know if it's the language barrier, or if you just don't want to understand, but I can't anymore. But why? Did Malo show you the gift? Don't go near my son. I forbid you to approach him! - I don't want to hurt you. - I don't care! Forget me! Why are you trying to screw me like that? Do you want to blackmail me? Well here you go, I raised money for you... But what do you say? Do you take me for a whore? You are the one who came to my table, you danced with me, you kissed me, you wanted to undress, I love you! But I do not! Now you're going to apologize to me! Don't make tapes, get up! You are fine? Henri, what are you doing here? Did you follow me? Where did this freak come from? Henri! Die, motherfucker! Stop it, Jonah! Henri! Henri! Astrid. Then? It's all right? I wanted to ask you if you would mind sleeping over there. It's just that Henri and I have just left the restaurant and we wanted to spend the night at the hotel and enjoy. Oh thank you, you are a sweetheart. I'll call Malo in the morning to explain. And obviously we pay you more. Yes, you are a sweetheart. The house is yours. There is everything in the guest room: toothbrush, towels... Thank you, see you tomorrow. You were perfect. Come on. This dress is beautiful and I love this lavender blue. It's very fresh and looks great on you. I've had my eye on him for a while, but... It's magnificent. They'll think I'm something classic, but I wouldn't use it in my house. - Yeah, you're kind of classic. Do you already know the news from Mathilde? What are you going to tell us? That she works in a hypermarket or is dedicated to prostitution? No, she met someone. - I do not believe. Already? - Yes Yes Yes. Justin saw her yesterday in Paris and she was leaving a restaurant with a man. - But did you talk to her? - Yea. She even introduced him. Eve. - What's it? - Reassure her. Yes, don't worry. Boss? - Boss? - Yea? She had these documents with him. Jonas Karez. 29 years old. AND? Did you hear something? He was known to the police. Several women denounced him for harassment. The last one was just over a year ago. A certain Carla Kirchner Linz. He followed her around like it was her hobby. She took him to court. That's why she wore the electronic bracelet. Yea? Eve, the police are here, they want to ask you some questions. The police? What happened? Please enter. Hello. I'm Koch from the Criminal Police. My deputy, Herr Lehnsmann. We're investigating a Jonas Karez. He drowned. Did you know him? - Not. - Curious. He seemed to know you. He had his picture taped to the wall. As I said? Felix? What was it called? - Jonah...? - Karez. She was here several times, in the media library. I believe he was a friend of one of our partners. So I finally knew him. Yes, well, bad. He wandered through the shelves, wanting to improve his French. - I understand. - Yea. And when he walked through the shelves, didn't he notice anything unusual? Do not. Can you give us the contact details of the person who introduced you? Mrs. Belin, yes. Yes, I give it to you. Funny, you have the same shirt as in the picture he had of you. Oh yes? Yes. It's the photo on the media library's website. Is not serious. It suits you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Do you have plans? What are you going to do now? I have a friend who has an apartment in Brussels and she invited me to go there and rest. I've never seen the Manneken Pis, so... It's very small, you'll see. Sorry, it's important. I am? Yes tell me. Oh hello, do you have information? What? Can I call you later? Thanks. See you soon. Is everything okay, Tina? Do you know that I asked a company to find out who was the author of the emails they received? Discovered the IP address. The emails were sent from the Monliberts' computer. And... do you think it was her or him? Is it over there. When I was with him. I suppose there are people who are capable of anything to preserve... your honor. THE YOUNG MAN DROWNED IN THE DANUBE She's a real prude, Éléonore. We didn't have to organize this dinner. Why are you saying that? If that's okay. It's all right. The new one is competent. I don't want to know that it's closer. I've always skied in France. - I have my routines. - Yea. If you spent a day in Innsbruck, you'd go crazy with the row of peasants in Chamrousse. For starters, we never go to Chamrousse. We've been going to Courchevel for many years... Are you waiting for someone? - No, no, no. - Not. Oh, it must be Astrid. Astrid is the babysitter. Yes, she forgot her math book and is coming to get it. Good night, Mrs. Monlibert. Sorry to bother you at this hour and in the middle of dinner with friends, but we need to talk to you. Can't wait for tomorrow? I'm afraid not. Would you rather we do it here or at the police? I'll get my suitcase. Does not care for my deputy to do some routine checks? Clear. Goodnight. Wine is wonderful, isn't it? - Yes yes. - Great. - Did you try the peanuts with wasabi? - Not. They're good, they're spicy. Lehnsmann called. They found the address of the cafe near the location of the body on her car's GPS. Very well. We already have proof. Is Lehnsmann still there? I think so. Great. Tell her to bring her husband. I have some questions for you. A FEW MONTHS LATER Around five in the morning, a police patrol tried to inspect a vehicle with two occupants on Dixmude Avenue in Brussels. End of the Monlibert process. The case that shook Austria and put the famous French couple, finished with archiving. Eve and Henri Monlibert were acquitted for acting in self-defense, but were forced to resign. These months have been very difficult for my clients, but I am glad that his innocence was proved. Now it only remains to hope that they can recover their lives and that Mr. Monlibert can return to his role as orchestra director. Good Morning. Good Morning. Is it possible to do a wash and comb? Let me see if there are still openings. Yes. You're lucky there was a cancellation. Román will come right away. Do you want a coffee or a tea? No, thank you. Thanks. Such as? Well. Good Morning. Sophie. Oh Eve. How kind of you to come. I come to say goodbye. Do you know we leave tomorrow? Already? AND... Then? Do you already have your bags packed? The bags? The boxes, you mean. I don't know how we're going to do it, but... - Sophie, I'm sorry... - Yes? - Oh. Hi Eve. - Hello. - Are you ready yet? - Yea. - Well, I'll... - No, say it. I think we should thank Annie Ernaux. If you could talk to her and send her some Mozart chocolates... - Yeah, don't worry, I'll take care of it. - Good... - A good return. - Thanks. I'm going to miss those Mozart bonbons. Eve. Wait. I saw you at reception. It's good to see you. Are things going better? Yes, thank you very much. You know...? The media library has lost a lot since you're gone. The new one needs to learn everything. You've done a terrific job. Seriously. Because your predecessor wasn't quite an ace... That's true. I... I hear you're returning to Paris. Yes. It's good for you. It's good for you to change the air. And... I've seen how everyone here has turned their backs on you. But don't call these people. There is no one to judge you. Do you think they don't have their little secrets? Now you have to live for yourself. Regardless of what others think. That's why... I have my books, I don't mix, I prefer it that way. And it does well. Don't waste your life because of some imbeciles. Thank you. Okay? It took a lot for me to fall asleep. I got a message from the girl at the agency. She stayed for 3 pm. So we have time, don't we? - What time do the types of changes come? - At 12:00. Until 15:00 we have enough time. I don't think I'm going to Paris with you. What? I've been thinking and I don't think it's a good idea. It is not viable. How is that not feasible? Eve. We have to make separate lives. Otherwise, we don't turn the page. I can't forget what we did, I can't get over it. Henry, it's absurd. We've already turned the page, you know? - We've been given another chance. - No, I can't. Ever since we've been together, when we got back together, that's all I've been thinking about. And above all I think about the reasons that made us reach this point. I betrayed you. Because I was bored. Because I'm bored with you. Why did you stay? Why didn't you leave me? Anyone else had given up a long time ago, believe me. Why do you always forgive me everything? I could never get you pregnant, I cheated on you for months. Have you ever thought about getting divorced? Never? Why did you turn against her? Why did you do everything to get me back? Because? So you don't lose face in front of Clémence and all those imbeciles. Do not say anything? Do not say anything. Is that all you care about? The prestige? The appearances? Fucking motherfucker! Pig! You're a pig! I loved you, okay? Please sit.
