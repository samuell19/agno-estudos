I know I wish it was just difficult Let me tell you what happened that it went on to here Oh well, What did you do?! That's too much. OK.... That's enough Thank you - Ehsan! Can I say something? - Say dear Bahar I must tell you You have a lovely face due to your age You have a lovely face due to your age - So, That means my age is bad or my face? - Both of them are good, My Dear Thank you honey Bahar, Do you know? You have a kind, lovely and beautiful face therefore you see everybody like yourself You told that, Why I don't say?! I Love You so much I feel relaxed when i'm with you There is something on people's faces that shows their loveliness, however they try to change themselves to any form Yes, you’re right I agree Everything went well Everyday we got closer and more intimate Until one day I think that was a week after her birthday That Bahar was vanished suddenly! I don't know why! But her kindness were a lot that maybe she had right to leave Ah, That passed till Negar came in my life And she… look Eshan We can’t be with together For what Negar!? Because we don't match Why we won’t?! I thought It doesn’t be It doesn’t be How did you reach this result?! Honey! It can’t do without any reason That means my opinion is not important here! You are important; You are I don’t want we depend to each other We can’t separate after this If that was important, You wouldn’t go I can’t We don't match each other Bye,Bye,Bye Forgive me for waiting Then she didn’t have any acceptable reason Nothing She didn’t give me any acceptable reason I understood later that she left me for someone else Just because of that he was more handsome How did you get it?! That boy is familiar Who’s that?! Mohammad He ignores the girls very fast! Which work you should how to do Which… For example which clothes you should wear for which place or don’t wear Which work you should to do now or shouldn’t to do Hi, How Are You? And in each situation you know to do what What is true, What is wrong To be careful, Not to be careful And... take care of situation You know? Caring about situation is more important for me Is that important for you too? You said what is important? Look, You don’t care about me Always your attention is on your cellphone I just sent a message for a moment A moment what? Your attention was on your phone for a moment?! You didn’t hear all of my words I heard all of your words You were talking that… I don’t know… That’s good wearing clothes What?! Tell me one word of that Tell me one word of that Always that is in this way It’s not your first time - Mohammad! Please forgive me - What thing I must forgive exactly? Won't happen again No, be comfortable.

Get away May I? Hi My name is Mohammad Why did you follow Negar?! I went to talk to her why did she do that with me?! I saw something,then i forgoet her forever Get away And this is too valuable that you should know to how do everything Which… For example which clothes you should wear for which place or don’t wear Which work you should to do now or shouldn’t to do Hi, How Are You? And... This is too valuable for me. It's too important for me Is that important for you too? What? You said what is important? Where are you honey? Where are you?

It turned out She was friends with several others For this, they are twisted to me. They don't show up I thought she was just with me I called her a few times a day I think so, She broke up with me You know I was not like that boys she loved I was sensitive to her Nowadays when girls find out that someone loves them They leave say that Goodness is bad Then they leave you alone But then it turns out that they arewith someone else And All their words were lie yes, you’re right Because this happened to me again So everything seems good to me... I heard that again Look Leila... I... I'm inherently emotional feelings are important for me I always do anything from my feelings Wow ... I like the man with the feeling The man must be kind Understand the women What benefit, I was always annoyed with my feelings to the girls Why?!! Because of I loved the girlfriend Or I was interested in it Left me alone Girls for them always Appearance is important, not feeling No,No Not at all. I’m not like this Emotions and feelings are important to me,not appearance Of course the appearance should be good But morality and behavior are more important Then the appearance of the person Do you like my Appearance? Don't mention it, Yes it is... It's important to have a feeling And the emotional man is very slight Of course men are very emotional But they don't show up Or they are fool like me Don't say so Why fool? You're so good Thank you dear You too - Well so that was so good - Yea But it did not last long - I can say exactly, one day - one day!!? She was said that felt important Her feeling was falsehood I wanted to say we can not be together I don't hate you.... I will not break your heart... I'm leaving for myself and you.... It's so much better... Good night! How cruel If you hurt,then its youre turn One day the same thing will happen to her You're right It happened to her The sound of breaking the heart is silent You must break your heart to hear the sound of its breaking - That was a lot worse - Yea I didn't know so before But when it happened to me I changed my mind I just found out,how bad and heavy it can be When someone selfish, it ends a relationship It does not matter whether we have been together for a day or one hundred years It is important to have an emotion that has been created and broken It has nothing to do with its time More time together Makes your memories more - We don't match each other - Wow Ehsan,You're so good - I love your feelings - I can not be with you I decided not to continue, But... - Hello - Hello - Do you have any problems? - Yes,My car tires have been damaged!

Yes! - Did you know Negar?! - Yes! When you were with you, she was with me too Later I realized that she was with several others Look, One time Maybe what we want for ourselves With what is good for us Two things are different But... Someone like a Negar does not care for me Always looking for a better person They store everyone Not important for me too These people are just looking for money You have the money... They will play naghareh on kings mustache for you (The Naghareh case is a musical instrument) But when they understand,You love them They are going somehow It seams, they hate all their feelings Yeah you're right But I'm looking for someone who wants myself for me Wants me my true self... No money You can not trust these people Yes, Of course For someone who has more money, leaves you alone Exactly In this situatio there is nothing but a broken heart You know Attachment is different from devotion In attachment, she wants you, Because you are to her advantage But in devotion she wants you even if you are not advantage for her That's why I do not care about the girls Being being,If not that someone else comes in Or have really worth it I wish I was like you But if I do not have emotional to someone, I can not be with her That selfish girl is coming Cheater It turned out your head is warm with somebody else Did you know Shahrzad?
