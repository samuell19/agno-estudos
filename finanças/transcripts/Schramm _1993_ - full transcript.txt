THE LONELY DEATH OF THE LIPSTICK-KILLER Hello. Have you ever really thought about God? Hi, Lothar. I'm glad you're home. May I come in? "The doctor" will be here any minute. The one who always wants to be alone first? Shall I make some coffee? No, I've got to go back. He just needs a couple of minutes. Don't you mind having a man wander around your flat by himself? I charge extra for that. Hello. Have you ever really thought about God? We would like to talk to you about how Jesus Christ, when he was crucified, died for your sins, too. Have you ever given thought to the fact that man is a creature of immense perfection? That can't possibly be just a whim of nature. If you could spare a few minutes of your time, we'd like to tell you more about it. May we come in? Can I get you a cup of coffee? Or maybe a cognac? All right, but just a small one. I'd prefer a coffee, but only if it's not too much trouble. No, it's a pleasure. I'm glad you're here. There. The coffee will be ready in a minute. Have you ever really thought about God?

You're exactly the kind of young woman we had in mind. I guess it'd be OK, but... I assume that from a financial point of view it would be very attractive to you. The house is about thirty minutes out of town. In case there are any problems, here's my card. All right, then. We're counting on you. Goodbye. Usually, I only work in my flat. But he asked me if I'd come to his place. He's got friends over for the weekend, and... he said he was going to pay well for it. I feel a bit uneasy about it, because they didn't say what exactly it is that he wants me to do. On the other hand, I'm curious... Well, what do you think it's all about? I don't know. He looked me up and down and asked me a few questions. He said I had a nice voice. He's the kind of guy you'd expect to kiss your hand. Very "old school", you know? So, you want to go there? Would you come with me? It's out of town, and you could wait outside for me. That would be very kind of you, and it would put me at ease. I can do that. But you have to remind me again in advance. You don't have to do it if you don't want to. But I do want to do it. I'll be glad to. Thanks. Well, I have to go back. I'm expecting a customer. He's always early. ...in German, as you said, JÃ¶rg Buttgereit, entitled "Nekromantic". This one-of-a-kind curiosity, banned in Germany, has gained cult movie status. You don't want to hear it, but I'll tell you anyway. You love me because I'm there. But just crossing the street to reach me would be too much for you. You're just lazy. Has the anaesthetic taken effect yet? Can you still feel anything? Then we can make a start. Open wide. It almost came out of its own accord. Hang on. What do we have here? That doesn't look good at all. Open wide. You'll feel better in a minute. Let's go. There were five of them, including the one you saw. That room... It was huge and furnished incredibly expensively, with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and expensive carpets. Marble, stucco... Like a parlour from the 19th century. There were five old men sitting in their armchairs, two of whom were only wearing silk dressing gowns. One came from an adjoining room that was tiled from top to bottom with white tiles. I didn't see all of it, but I got the feeling there was someone else in there. And what exactly did they want from you? I mean, those strange clothes you were wearing... One of them handed them to me when I arrived, and he videotaped me while I was putting them on. At first, I thought they wanted to take turns going to bed with me. And they didn't? No, they wanted me to be their servant and do whatever they pleased. They watched closely how I moved and whether I could do what they asked me to. It was almost like an entry exam. They said they wanted me to come back, and with what they pay me, I can hardly refuse. I've done things that were a lot worse for a fraction of what they pay me. You must know what you're doing. You know what? I'll invite you for dinner tomorrow. How about it? As a little "thank you". I think I have to go and see a dentist tomorrow. Well, thanks a lot. You're welcome. Cheers. That looks neatly arranged. More importantly, it tastes good. Is this part of the garnish, or are you meant to eat it? Tell me... you said that you might want to get married. Did anything interfere with your plans, or did you just change your mind? No. She just never realised that she almost became my wife. You could say it was a one-sided engagement. I see. Could we pay, please? I think I'll have a cognac. Do you want one, too? No, no alcohol. I like doing this once in a while. I'm usually too impatient to cook anyway. What about those convenient ready meals from the supermarket freezer? I always have a few of those at home. Why don't we have the next meal at my place? That reminds me, they want me to go back to the mansion the day after tomorrow. Could you accompany me again? The day after tomorrow? Yes, that's fine. Goodnight, Lothar. I'm not really tired yet. I'll make us some coffee. Sugar, milk? Or maybe a cognac? I thought you didn't drink alcohol? I always have something in the house for special occasions. OK, but just a small one. I'm right in the middle, and the teacher is walking up and down, talking. All of a sudden, I realise that I'm not wearing any clothes. I look around, and I'm scared that the others might see it. Then, very slowly, so nobody notices, I slip my hand between my legs, but there's nothing, nothing at all. It's completely smooth. And then I wake up. Yes... the happy days of one's childhood. Well... I've got to go to bed now. Tomorrow's gonna be a busy day. You can't stop at one. I'll fix us a nightcap. You slut! You dirty little bitch! Do you wash their dicks before you give them a blowjob? You dirty little piece of shit! Do you know what I did to the others? No, you don't. You don't know anything, you whore! You pig! Well? Did you sleep well? I didn't want to wake you up last night. Oh, my head... You must've been very tired. Hello. Have you ever really thought about God?
