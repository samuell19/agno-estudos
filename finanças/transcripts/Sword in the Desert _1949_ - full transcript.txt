Vogel we're exactly eight miles north of Khan Younis if we're south of it we're off the coast of Egypt not Palestine maybe you'd like me to swim ashore and come back with a matzo ball these people are depending upon me to get them safely through if I am cautious it's only because the British have so often captured us in these last few miles well they aren't gonna be caught aboard my ship I know what happened to the exodus and the San Felipe if this mob of yours is too scared to make a dashboard they can swim ashore I'm pulling out of here they are not scared captain but these people have come all the way from Poland and Germany from Romania and Hungary most of them are the survivors of concentration camps Elson but they have heard the screams of their loved ones as they were dragged into strikers get over my turn akin Buchenwald this is their last hope you wouldn't dump them overboard like cattle now when they can almost see the shore let's get this straight mr. a few days ago

bosun's probably dead what's the next move I do not know yet we shall have to give it some thought you'd better think fast I've got to get back to my ship now it's not so easily arranged for this mobile units are on every road now searching for the refugees whom you landed this morning it would be unwise for any of us to move until they've given up just when will that be three or four days at the soonest that's great and what's going to happen to my ship while I wait around here three or four days what instructions did you leave on board captain nothing to cover this how did I know I was gonna be shot at shanghaied and chased all over the joint when you failed to return wouldn't your first officer have sense enough to guess what happened and move the ship out beyond the 12-mile limit no no no he's not very bright isn't this a transmitter that gave us the signal to come in yes I know how to operate these things let me call it you know what everything the British here in half an hour or even less why how would they know where we were every British patrol is equipped with special locating apparatus the moment we broke radio silence they would triangulate on our position and close in they've done it to us twice before in other places we shall have to wait no until they've left this area entirely look do you know what will happen if the British find my ship a destroyer will tore into - she'll be seized for illicit blockade running and my crew arrested I'll be fine thrown into jail lose my license and my papers you refuse to let me send one short message to Sabre is

voice seems rather familiar somehow have we ever met before I can't recall it I doubt if we move in the same circles perhaps not but I've long looked forward to the pleasure I don't understand my dear girl I doubt if there's a single building in all Palestine where your voice is not entered and a very charming voice it is true although your daily broadcasts are very seldom flattering to me my superior officers all my complaints I don't know who you think I am but you're obviously mistaken Am I yes quite well frankly I hope so you're a very pretty girl Sabra much too attractive to be sent to prisoners eliten yes sir this young woman is under arrest take it to the car yes sir I say what rotten luck but not for us this way please all the villagers have been accounted for sir but those beggars have been here right enough found a dead man who didn't have time to bury at a brick through his chest oh man he was one of the illegals very well sergeant prepare to move yes sir they can't

told you Vogel I'm sorry about the girl maybe she got away she didn't get away we know that what ten men she was to us I and twice that why that's none of your business the British had a stand an order of a thousand pounds for anyone that turned her in you must have known about that when you use the shortwave I'll leave him alone David there's no more to blame for this and you or I we should have made certain she was with us the British would never have come to the village if he hadn't betrayed us and now he's scared scared he'll lose his ship and his money scared of what he has done to us what we might now do to him it's my decision to make not yours just soak your head Vogel you're talking like a fool stop ectopic you're out of your mind you meant nothing by it no there's not enough heart in this man to mean a word he says I told you to leave him alone that's an order now control yourself pretty on the same was the makings of a great voice it's 2:00 a.m. jury and that back soon with the gasoline will know they've been caught not Dovan J know they could fool the Grand Mufti himself [Music] let's see if these wallahs know anything Marhaba Marhaba 1350 yahood feet Raquel Layla I were short on men would that no sir Brahman nahi Jizzle Kabir her neck yahood oh well we're had yet a lot had oral killer Massillon ally selmak a light stomach they say a Jewish tribe passed along here half an hour ago come on we'll catch it up well what did you decide about me if you can run thousands into this country it ought to be simple to get one out we have more reason to get them in look you've got other ships making this illegal run you can put me on the next one that lands a bunch I can pay my own way what's wrong with that scheme there's no other ship scheduled for several weeks that's why yours is so valuable to us now if you'd hold him out I told you before all I'm asking is to get clear of this Messer sooner the better and what would you be willing to give in return so that's the yang no you pay me to bring him in and I pay you to get out not at all you earn the money it's yours to keep but protection has the price of gratitude captain you need it and we need you badly so I'm ready to make a bargain with you on this ought to be good let's hear it you say your ships next port of call is Beirut that's right will it wait for you there say five or six days that better why then I'll try to get you there it's a long way in dangerous every mile be guarded by the British and their Arab spies what come on what's the payoff simply this you're no friend of ours you said so yourself and proved it by betraying us so why should I risk a Jews life to save you well that's just common decency again sit by and watch a man go under when you're holding a rope exactly in distress all men are brothers and my rope is the road to Beirut yours is your ship so if you'll give us one more voyage with refugees at the same price I'll have one of my men guide you into Beirut how do I know I can trust him but you trust me captain you fucker you're one of the big shots in this fight you wouldn't risk your neck for me I would not risk anyone elses I like to think it over you're not serious about this certainly but this man's no Gordie double-crosser sure as God made his lapis he also made man McCarthy so there's some good in all of us well that hasn't been my own experience I was beginning to worry did you see anyone on the road yes the British stopped us on our way back what did they say I say have you seen any Jews yeah I whoever had your a lot I'll kill em you can't put the gasoline the trucks to leave before daylight [Music] [Music] Stan will make a move away fire [Music] sided detail an antelope over there transport then corporal favor in his section to cover the other end of this one watch them Mills you cover us when we move in try to get away but what about you you don't know who I am go quickly [Music] come from Africa [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up sir anything wrong [Music] quite the contrary perhaps take these along sergeant they may be of great importance [Music] look easy with their minds you want to blow us all into kingdom come [Music] [Music] [Music] now young woman answer the questions truthfully you have nothing to fear to simply tell us the truth we've been in touch with Tel Aviv the address you gave us is correct enough we also found that you were seldom there where do you go are two of the communal villages for the Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra I am a cellist and what does a cellist need with pliers and the screwdriver why not what does a soldier need with flowers the orchestra is now in Tiberias why aren't you with them of course I've not been well I went to any ACOG to rest - it almost evens you told me you picked up a prize package someone to be wanted for years now we find this billiard cello player not that I dislike music on the country okay the piano myself Chopin after your message I telephoned general Vincent in Jerusalem he became quite excited thought you might have caught cutter himself now you'll be calling me back or sending someone down here that'll be most embarrassing why the devil don't you check your facts before you put the wind up everyone this girl is concealing the truth sir the force of the resistance army left Dania Cove only a few minutes before we arrived he intercepted their Wireless and made an absolutely certain fix on the village message was sent to ship somewhere off the coast warning it to clear out undoubtedly the same ship with slender the refugees near Khan Younis early yesterday morning mmm yes the refugees you failed to locate and we still haven't heard from Ellison who said on a wild goose chase into the desert anyway what's that got to do with her I believe she operated the transmitter which sent the message furthermore I'm convinced that she is the person called Sabra who agitates against us as the voice of Israel this girl ha nonsense I hear the program every day Sabra some dried up middle aged female who has been disappointed in love who else could be so don't you agree but I'm afraid not sir it's part of my job with intelligence to hear rebroadcast sabra makes next to cutter she's our greatest problem I studied a voice for months the accent inflection and color they sound remarkably alike this is a very serious charge and woman you got to save yourself speak up I listen to Sabra myself all of us to will feel strongly about the British policy in Palestine so I think it's quite a compliment that you should mistake me for her if you are innocent then you'll have no objection to a very simple test I should like to make with your permission sir this is a portion of the broadcast made by Sabra on the morning of December 14th ten days ago I would like you to read it aloud please all our request is that you let us record your voice speak slowly and clearly if the test is honest you will feel nothing by it you may decide that yourself is this fair enough begin reading please this is the voice of Israel speaking to the people of Palestine to the soldiers of the underground forces to the British Army of Occupation it is not our intention to try to convince anyone of the Justice of our cause the entire world now knows the issues upon which we disagree there is a long and bitter struggle behind us and it is inevitable that still more blood will be shed before you leave but it is only fair that these men should know why they may be killed most of your British soldiers have been in this country for quite a long time a great many of you here and in England are friendly toward us but you have orders to obey well so do we you have occupied our country deprived us of our home and our freedom so we must fight you there is no other solution as long as you remain in Palestine we deplore this need of violence and regret the death of any human being as a result of that violence but we hold that's quite enough thank you now pay it back what's the point in repeating it bomb up we all have what she said I want her to hear it sir not all of it just enough to answer one question soldiers have been in this country for quite a long time a great many of you here and in England are friendly toward us but you have orders to obey well so do we you have occupied our country deprived us of our home and our freedom so we must fight you there is no other solution could you get that clearly yes and you're quite willing to admit it was your voice of course it was my voice confounded Bowman who else's voice could it be it was no one else's sir this recording is not the one she just made we replaced it with an actual transcription of the underground radio taken directly from the air by our intelligence office in Jerusalem ten days ago I'll be blasting Carter was with you in the village but why did he leave you behind to be caught sure does no fool it must have been an accident she's far too valued and you must also have been at the beach you exchanged the signal with the ship what was his name what flag who was the captain [Music] I mean major Sorrell from GHQ sir show him in a talking love didn't waste much time getting here will you come in please sir how do you do sir l and yourself know these gentlemen no son I I don't think I've had the pleasure major Stevens Captain Beaumont myself I say sir L won't you were ll a man with Monty's crowd yes yes quite a do wasn't it the GOC sent me over so soon as he received your message is this the prisoner yes this is Sabra Sabra my well what a catch this will give general Vincent a most enjoyable Christmas you know he's still absolutely boiling over that broadcast of hers yesterday morning saying that he's been sent back to England for failure l what what are your orders Oh to escort the prisoner back to Jerusalem to try the questioning zone [Applause] very well then take her along thank you sir I say Beaumont would you telephone GHQ and tell the general we're on our way right you'll have no evidence against me not proof whatever you'll be given every chance to clear yourself should we go now whoever you are yes whoever I am I'm still a Jew and this is my country you have no rights here moral or legal and therefore no authority over me what an extraordinary people do they think we relish our position as policemen in this godforsaken land perhaps they prefer that we for sacred sir let god police it but we have agreed to leave if they can reach an agreement for the Arabs on partition but if we pull out before there's an agreement between them in time at least may go up in flames and with it the world no students this isn't a Jewish or Arab or British problem this is the problem of all mankind get me GHQ in Jerusalem I would like to speak to general Vincent [Music] [Music] this isn't the road to Jerusalem really so he doesn't why are you taking me well it's a very nice day where would you like to get on don't be sadistic major I've had a very difficult day Qaeda survived [Music] well Jeff did you get firmance message definitely old boy definitely in fact I congratulated him for such a brilliant job of intelligence a little bit of both really but this car and the orders did you it's very simple you see I was once a major in the British Army as for the car well we did some months ago and hid it away for just such an emergency no vocal cat has been caught when well ended this morning in the desert south of Arecibo well all of them except their girl who escaped general dad McCarthy the refugee isn't the American dinner do the biggest no it's Carla they've got I don't know probably not at least not yet it's a British convoy should we stop not if we can help him lastly trucks never ours stop turn around they've got goddamn Bo this what can we do I don't know yet [Music] these men were answer there was one more who made a break and we lost him in the desert huh I want these four prisoners and this one you want them sir do you mean now yes now well take the small lorry I have too many will guard them but I can't do that sir without direct authority from a senior officer of my own brigade don't you recognize the GHQ insignia when you see it yes sir but my orders are quite definite and so are mine and they come from a considerably higher source than your kennel these five men are all wanted in Jerusalem I recognize them from their pictures you're a liar you never laid eyes on any picture of mine we shall see if you refuse to turn these men over to me you'll regret it I can promise you that then I'm very sorry sir but I shall have to take the risk and this unless I may see your orders sir any well if you insist come with me to my car yes sir major I knew I'd seen him somewhere before forget it and you how much can you forget what do you mean we may still be able to get out of this no or later unless you talk give me a word Ivanovich or not sure wait that's all I want I promise till I get you safely back to your ship you keep your word and I'll keep mine but that was last night you can't do a thing for me now don't be so sure that girl she's the one topping Getti but I say what the don't say it get in the car [Music] hello what goes on here wasn't that our lifting up in that car hi where's he off to in such a bloomin hurry what's wrong guys did you did you lose something [Music] there were troops of the 23rd able so now at least we know where their thing but that doesn't help us much because they've got a crack battalion that full strengthen the cat is that correct yes also several armored cars and to light tanks camp is fortified from every angle dahveed big searchlights and machine guns are mounted on the watchtowers at all four corners we haven't got enough men though weapons to match that force even if we found a way to break in our only chance is to take them by complete surprise there's no hope with that bull ever since our a tit outlet they've been on a 24-hour alert at every garrison in Palestine but the fact remains we've got to get curta out before they discover who is and how can they know who would tell them the American nose of godets well why would he tell him why wouldn't he he has no good Widow for us I saw him promoted on the road today what sort of man is he it was only his selfish do pity that brought this all about selfish yes but not stupid Sabra not when it comes to trading I think he is capable of anything there's nothing it for him and all the more reason we must rescue cutter oh I followed Vogel's orders and brought our best fighters here all I could gather on short notice but it would be suicide to attack that camp they cut us to bits before we got through the wire what can we do that even those were found in the Englishman's wallet I went through them there's nothing of importance I'm not so sure let's pay before look yeah you can't get away with this you know the penalty for kidnapping a British officer down you are not the first one we've caught all the last if you expect any ridiculous ran out talking elephant and listen carefully you are being held as a hostage for one of our men whom you captured in the desert if he is executed then we in reprisal will execute you in that case it isn't quite so ridiculous is it well now we know where we stand [Music] we don't want to kill you and we won't have to if our man goes free so by helping us you can also help yourself if you expect me to give information to save my own skin you can go and leap into the smelly end of the Dead Sea we're not that foolish charlatan then what do you want from me in your wallet we found this car the Vanara who calls himself Hamid the great how did you get it that's no secret some time ago I had this beggar in Hebron to perform at a party we planned for the troops at the airborne Kappa yes a win oddly enough I don't seem to recall can you read Arabic yes pry on the back of this

need it all of us [Music] I'm frightened I've never heard you say that or not for myself for you this read hasn't one chance in a thousand you know it I think if anything happened don't think about it I can't help it [Music] I don't tell you now I may never have the chance again tell me what's up I've loved you now for a long time the business that first night in Tel Aviv the concept sorry I had you then why haven't you told me before oh that bead if anything happens stop lying you've got the job tonight - I'm not going with you no you got to wait for us with the cars outside the camp oh good I was afraid you'd leave me here I'll never leave you anyway not for long you bother me I'm glad you bother me too terribly want to be finally all we have to worry about this just bothering each other all the time have a conference to meet of course we may not win every one but we won't lose too much I could lose you he should live that long I will if you will [Music] they're waiting for me you go with gauche Aveda you've forgotten something [Music] here they come [Music] what you want please we're not politicians we work for living bulla bulla man we no fight we shut up which one of you is our Matt the great him you've got a pass for the British cat give it to me come on [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] they question all of us no nobody's told them a thing not all J no all but one they've still got the America why didn't he come back ayah made a great mistake about trusting him at all I tell you takes the Irish to know how to handle it farmers I don't think healing for how did you get into this country I fell off a ship at night it swam ashore hmm what was the name of the ship I can't remember let us try to help you then two nights ago you landed a group of passengers from your ship on the coast of Palestine near communist does that refresh your memory yeah then for some obscure reason you decided to come ashore with a refugee why would I do a dumb thing like that I'm sure I don't know your country has chosen to stay out of this trouble but perhaps you wanted to collect this money eight thousand dollars it is yours isn't it I suppose so you found it in my pocket where did you get it maybe I'm a refugee I doubt it here's your copy of your master certificate in the mich Maureen and with the name like Michael Francis Dillon you could hardly be Jewish no I can't tell about that I heard of an Irishman by the name of de Valera what did you meet the group with whom you were found in the desert they picked me up on the road I'd never seen any of them before of course Dillon you know and we know that you're deliberately lying but it's no use we've learned this much for certain your ship is the eastern star you used it for smuggling illegal immigrants that is say you know the stiff penalty for that so you'll be much wiser to cooperate with us I'm not admitting anything you don't have to we know for my agents in Italy that you sail from Bari on December 17th and what you carried but somehow you slip through our blockade both ways that was very clever work captain although we may have lost your ship we still have you so what's the next move we have two choices one is to turn you over to the proper authorities for trial lever caused a rather unpleasant international situation but more unpleasant for you than anyone else you would be heavily fined lose your master certificate and perhaps sent to prison what's the other angle have you ever seen this before no what is it the notebook of istván cutter who's he one of the top leaders of the Jewish resistance and the most important one to us I never heard of him you must have captain he paid you this money you were with him last night in the desert he wall this emblem of the sword also he allowed you to call your ship on the shortwave yesterday only curta could have given you that permission so you can't identify him if you know all the answers why can't you identify him yourself we've never caught him before or known for certain what he looks like but he is one of the prisoners in their compound outside and you can tell us which one he is that is all we well so that's the deal either I point him out who turned me in as you say captain that is the deal Oh [Music] and afterward I can go free no tricks no strings not one I have here the authority from our headquarters in Jerusalem your papers will be returned you'll be allowed to rejoin your ship and the matter will be officially closed ok I'll do it exit you've made a most sensible decision coming up [Music] look here they call me it's what I'm after tellin ya he sold us out [Music] I would like our Christmas tree captain so that's what it is the only thing we could find in this desolate part of Palestine they call it the Judas tree for what according to the Bible Judas hanged himself on a tree after the betrayal the legend says it was a tree like this hence the infamous name I'm afraid it isn't very appropriate still it's better than no tree at all [Music] this way captain Dillon please separate sample the prisoners facing the wire along the west side now when we come to face him stop that's all we ask of you Percy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you didn't stop why I don't know why but you agreed to tell us I changed my mind don't be a fool captain these people mean nothing to you we've agreed upon the terms you do remember them don't you yeah I remember but still you refuse that's right you're making the greatest single mistake of your life maybe but I'm still gonna have to shave this mug every day for the rest of my life I wouldn't like what I saw so you can forget the whole deal leave him in here with the rest we'll take the lot of me to Jerusalem tomorrow leg put him inside [Music]
