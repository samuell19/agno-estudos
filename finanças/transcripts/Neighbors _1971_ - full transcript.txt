- Why should I be? We're just selling our house. It's a simple business transaction. - That's all I'm going to make it. - Uh-huh. You know what our name is gonna be here in this lovely neighborhood? Mister and Missus Mud. - I don't give a damn. Mary, this is the best thing we've ever done, you and me. You know before, all it's been is talk, talk, talk. But we've never backed up our talk. Our so called principles. We've gained a clean conscience here and there, giving a few bucks and all of that, and we've been big deals at the front lines of the cocktail parties, but we've never really laid it on the line. On the line, Mary. And this is it. This is no kidding. This is faith plus action. - Which equals? - I don't know. Whatever. Whatever. - Whatever. - Mary, thank you for being with me on this. - Are you kidding? - No, I mean it. I feel like a decent human being for the first time in my life. - Oh, is that why you're doing it? Guilt? - Not guilt, and don't give me any of that amateur analysis. I'm just going to say, I think it's gonna be tougher on you. I have a hunch some of our dear neighbors... - Oh, bigoted bastards. - At a girl. Where the hell are they? - Listen, don't forget, they're driving out. Now give them time. - I wonder if... - If what? - Oh, nevermind. - No, what? Wonder if what? - I was just going to say, I know it sounds peculiar, I was just going to say sort of, well, so it would be easier on them, I was wondering if they were going to drive up in a Cadillac. - Well, probably. - You know, just so it- - So they drive up in a Cadillac. Probably a big, white convertible Cadillac. They're not entitled? - That's not what I mean. You know what I mean, Mary. - Well let's hope that'll be their only problem. I didn't make anything fancy. Just cheese and crackers. I thought if I made something fancy, you know. Well, I could have made a clam dip or something, when I come to think of it. After all, a clam dip's not so... It's not like having black caviar or something. Anyway, I did get a nice cake for later on. - Mary. - I said I got a nice cake for later on. - Good. - With the coffee. - Good. You know what I feel good about? I mean, really good about? We're not moving away. Lots of people sell their houses to blacks and then they get the hell out of there. (speaking foreign language) But we're moving right down the road, not a half a mile away, and you know what that does? That makes it damn tough for some neighbor to come up to me and say, "You're ruining property values. You're ruining the neighborhood. How would you like to live near Blacks and have your kid playing with their kids?" "Well, damn right," I'll say, because I will be living near them and my kid will be playing with their kids and my property values are on the line just like yours, buddy. (laughs) Boy, I'd like to have a look at their face when they hear that. "They're gonna be my neighbors!" That's what I'll say. My neighbors. - Well, it certainly brings out the good old aggressive instinct, doesn't it? - You're damn right. We're not playing potsy, dear. We're in for a real battle, you and me. A real battle. A little aggressive instinct might come in mighty handy. (doorbell chimes) - You answer the door! - The trees, Mary. Light the trees. It's too bright. Mary, whatever? - Whatever. - It's a Cadillac. Hi! - [Man] Hi. - [Chuck] Come right in and welcome. Watch your step there. Those stairs are a little bit irregular. This is the living room, and this is my wife, Mary. Mary, these are the Gunthers. Mister and Missus Gunther. - How do you do? - Hi. I'm Bill and she is Vicky. - Hi. - Hello, Vicky. - Here, let me take that. - Oh, don't bother. - Oh, it's very beautiful. - Don't bother! - Of course. - Well, I'm glad you came. We were getting to be a little bit nervous. You know when you're selling a house, you keep wondering if the customers are going to show up. (Bill laughs) Well, let's all sit down, shall we? How long did it take you to drive up? - Oh, about an hour. - Yeah, that's it, all right. River Glen Highway and then Cross Country. That Cross Country is a bitch, but otherwise, it's a pretty good drive up. - [Mary] Of course, I always take the throughway. The throughway's really better, you know? - Well only if you live on the North side, Mary. Otherwise, you've got all that crosstown traffic and that's murder. But anyway, you got here. - We got here. - Any trouble finding the house? - Oh no. No, no, no. That red door did it. - That red door, that's Mary's idea. Always wanted a house with a red door. Why did you always want a house with a red door, Mary? I never found out. - Well, I don't know. I just wanted a house with a red door. Does there have to be a reason? - Must be something in your mind. You know, some symbol, some childhood trauma. - Now who's playing amateur analyst? A red door has to stand for something, hm? You know, that's one of the favorite pastimes around here. Everybody's been to an analyst and that gives them the right to rip anybody's character wide open in public. Oh my goodness, and you know, I could throw the names around, like trauma, or psychotic, neurotic. - Not to mention castration complex. (Bill laughs) - Not to mention! Well, anyway, in this house, I'm the only one who has the right to play parlor analyst because I've been. This character really needs it. He won't go near it. But let anybody say anything or do something and out comes Chuck with his two cents worth of Freud. (Mary chuckles) (Chuck laughs) Well, I think the time has come when in the interest of family harmony, I'm compelled to suggest that we all have a drink, right? What'll it be? - Don't mind if I do. - What'll it be, a Scotch? - How about a little bourbon? - Bourbon. Yes, sure. Soda, water? - [Bill] Straight up. - Bourbon straight up. Vicky? - Same here. - Bourbon it is, all around. - Well, this is quite a room. - [Bill] Well, that's Mary. She's the decorator. I don't like to say it, but I think she did a pretty professional job. You know, she's never been to decorator's school or anything. - [Mary] Oh, thank goodness Chuck and I have the same tastes. Otherwise, I'd just hear him saying, "You stink as a decorator." (Vicky chuckles) - I like this couch. Golly, it must be about 100 feet long. Thank you. - Vicky, we once had 10 people sitting on that couch. I counted them. Of course they had to play kneesies, like it or not. (chuckles) It's only a fair set, but I'm not a hi-fi bug, you know? I don't know from weeders and tweeders (Bill laughs) and woofers and all that. It plays good. I'm satisfied. - It's very nice. - Well, here's cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers and hallelujah. - Cheers and hallelujah. I like that. I like that. Cheers and hallelujah. (Chuck laughs) I shouldn't say this. I know I shouldn't say this. It's bad salesmanship. But only two people answered our ad and you're one of them. - Oh, really? What happened to the other guy? - Price was too steep. - [Bill] Ah. - Anyway, I'm glad you're here. When you're selling a house, boy, it's good to have a real, live, hot prospect. Believe you, me. - Chuck, they haven't even been through the house yet. I mean, we don't know if Vicky or Bill really like the house. I'd love to show them around. - [Chuck] What do you mean, they won't like it? Isn't she awful? She's worse than I am. Aren't we a couple of salesmen? (chuckles) They're gonna love it. I mean, what's not to love? - Why, I love it already. - You see? - She's thinking about the parties she can throw here in this ballroom. - You like big parties? - Mary, you're talking to the Martha Mitchell of Harlem. She thinks that 25 cats is an intimate little group. - Well now, I don't ever see you acting like a hermit. I mean, that's Mister Life of the Party himself. - Well now, honey, when you get them together, you may as well keep them away. - And the neighbors? - Tell them to come on over, too. A party is a party, right? - [Chuck] Right. - Well, I'm sure you're dying to see the house. - Oh, I'd love to. - [Chuck] Oh, wait a minute, now. Wait just a minute! What's the hurry? The house, oh, the house will keep. Mary, Mary, the house will be after all. Let's have another drink, relax a little. These are prospects. Customers, Mary. We gotta soften 'em up a little. You know, feed them a couple of drinks, and then we slip them the contract. - You two men can do as you wish. I'm gonna show Vicky the house. Come on, Vicky. I know who's going to make the decisions. - You got it, Mary. If she says buy, we buy. Me, I just pay the bills. - Same here. What happened to men, anyway? Thank heavens. - [Mary] Through here. I think we'll start with the kitchen. I think it has everything. - She's not kidding. That kitchen has got more gadgets than a space capsule. It's got buttons and switches and signal lights. You gotta be an engineer to cook a soft boiled egg. One time, I pulled the wrong switch and I made a solid piece of charcoal out of a sirloin steak in two minutes, and that's hard to do. Well, we've got our toys. You know. Automobiles, hi-fis, sports cars. They're entitled to their little fun, I guess. Well, cheers and hallelujah. - Cheers. - Bill, are you a do-it-yourself type? You know, work around the house? - No, no. - [Chuck] Me neither. Not that I can't, you know. I'm handy, but home is no place for work. Mary's always trying to get me to build this and fix that. I've got a workshop down in the basement with a couple of power tools. I'll show that to you later. But I mean, who wants to? So I worked out a perfect answer. It's called Robinson's Law of Tranquility. Say a job comes up, see? Well, you apply Robinson's Law of Tranquility. Now this job can either be work or pleasure, right? So you analyze it. Now, if it's going to be pleasure, you say to yourself, well, there's a million things I could do right now that would give me more pleasure than this. So you reject it on the grounds of pleasure. And if it's going to be work, you say to yourself, well, there's a lot of work I could do right now that would be more profitable than this. So you reject it on the grounds of work, and you rest in perfect tranquility. Robinson's Law of Tranquility. I give it to you. It's free. It comes with the house. - Chuck, I kind of think you like to play games with yourself. - What do you mean? - Well now, I've got a better law than that. - What's that? - My word is law, and when I'm not going to do something, I just don't do it, and that's it. - Well, I guess it is sort of games at that. By the way, Bill, what do you do? I mean what line of work? - I'm a salesman. - A salesman? What, I mean what do you- - A salesman. - I'm in the display game myself. You know what that is? For advertising, we make displays. You know that stuff you see in bar windows and liquor store windows, department stores? Hey, would you like to see my latest masterpiece? I'll show it to you. This is gonna knock your eye out. Ta-dah! (both laugh) Pretty nifty, huh? - Woo! - [Chuck] Wait a minute, wait till you see how it works. (Bill coughs) White Elephant Gin. It stands alone, huh? Perfect, huh? Isn't that clever? What do you think, Bill? - Chuck, Chuck, that thing is wonderful. You mean to tell me that you really make a living out of those things? - Do I? Bet there's gonna be 5,000 of those in liquor stores from coast to coast. I mean to tell you I make a living off those things. (women chatting indistinctly) (Bill chuckling) - What's that? - Vicky, this is what Chuck makes. I mean, for a living. - Elephants? - Not elephants. No, it's a display for advertising. How was the tour? - Wait till you see that kitchen. By now, I don't ever have to learn how to cook. All I have to do is push a button. - Vicky, when did you ever plan on learning how to cook? - Oh, stop. - Oh, they have a woman who's coming up with them. She's gonna do the cooking and things. - Oh, a maid? No kidding. Well that's going to be very interesting. - Why is that? - It's just that you'll be the only woman in the whole neighborhood with a live in maid. I hope you don't mind that the other women are jealous of you, Vicky. - Oh for goodness sakes, what do I care? I'm no cook, I ain't ever gonna be no cook, and God and Bill's stomach both know it. - Amen. - Well let me show you the rest of the house. - Yeah, you girls finish the tour. Bill and I will have another snort, and then we'll look the place over. Right, Bill? - You're the salesman. - Come on, Vicky. I have a feeling these men are gonna float through the house. - [Chuck] Why is it that women think it's so evil to drink? Why do they make such a stink if a guy wants to relax a little? - Well, mine sure don't. - Vicky doesn't hit the ceiling whenever you tie one on? - No, I often have to sit down on her. She can drink me under the table, and frequently does. - You've got quite a wife there, Bill. - I got me a hunk of woman. - I mean, she's really beautiful, too. - The most. I mean, the most. Have you ever seen her? I mean, have you ever seen her perform? - You mean she's some kind of professional? - Well, yes, she used to be. Used to sing in nightclubs and stuff like that. Vicky Ives. She was great. Hey, why don't you try and get her to do a couple of numbers for you? She's really out of sight. You'd dig her. - Well, what do you know? Well, maybe I will. You think she would? - Think she would? Listen, Chuck. Anybody that asks Vicky to sing, why she's eternally grateful. (both chuckle) - Well, how about that? All right, I will. And she quit it, huh? - Oh yeah, we got a couple of kids now and, well, they have to be brought up and somebody's gotta bring them up. - How old are they? - Six and eight. She says she's gonna bring 'em up right if it kills her. And you know something? I think it is killing her. I mean, with me gone all the time, traveling around. She'd give her right arm to be with me. - You're around a lot then as a salesman, huh? - Yep, moving around all the time. - What territory? I mean, what, out of town, or? - Out of town, out of state, out of country. - Europe? - Oh, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, even. I just got back from Rome. (speaking Italian) You ever been to Rome? - No, we've never been abroad. We might make it this summer. - Let me tell you something about Rome. Now, Rome is one city where anything, and I mean anything goes. Man, I had me one hell of a time there. - So you wouldn't be around a lot? I mean, if you moved into the house? - Oh, yeah. But when I'm around, I'm around. You know, several weeks at a time. When I'm home, you know, I'm home. And well, Vicky and I, we like to have a ball. You know, we kind of like to make up for lost time. You understand what I mean? You know, we like to have a blast almost every night. Sometimes I think that I'm running the most elegant flophouse in Harlem. And you know something? Those cats, you can never get them to go home because they say, "Hey man, if we stay here long enough, maybe this party's gonna start all over again, you dig?" And you know something? They're right. (both chuckle) Just tell me something, Chuck? - Sure. - What do you folks do up here to get your jollies? I'm sorry, I mean your kicks. - Your kicks? Well, nothing like that, I assure you. (laughs) See, the fellows around here are mostly commuters and it's pretty quiet during the week, you know? Early to bed, early to rise. Keeps those bags from under your eyes. - Wow. - So it's kind of quiet, generally. Except for Fridays and Saturdays, now. That's different. That's when we open up. - Well, like how? - Oh, relatively speaking, of course. You know, a party here or there. Get together at somebody's house or another. - But like who? - Well, neighbors. That sort of thing. - Oh man, sounds like a drag to me. - It can get pretty gay sometimes. - I mean, seeing the same old people week after week. Oh man, it would really put me a one bummer. - Well you see, it's sort of like, well, a community. You know, everybody knows everybody else. It's really not too bad, Bill. It is not too bad. - Chuck, I think you're kidding yourself. - You think so? - You know what you really make me think of? An animal locked in a cage, and the animal says to himself, "Everything's cool. I mean, I'm comfortable and I'm cozy. So why do I wanna be free?" Yeah, that's exactly what you make me think of. Mm-hmm. I'm afraid, Chuck, old buddy, I think you're playing games with yourself all the time. - That's the second time you've said that. - No kidding. Must be the second time I thought it. - Well, I guess everybody's got his own way of getting satisfaction. - Ain't that the truth? - What I think you don't understand yet is that it can be a damn good life up here. A pretty damn good life. - Well, I try and understand. - I don't follow you. - I'm just not interested in the pretty damn good life up here. - No? - No. Just like you said, everybody's got his own way of getting his kicks, and I've got mine and no early to bed, early to rise commuter eyes for me. Mm-mm. Flagstone? - No, it's fieldstone. - Hm. - Well you just wait till you get up here. We never know, we never know. Certainly never know. - Well, I know. Say, how about another bourbon? - Bourbon. Hey, now you're talking. Bourbon is something I have got plenty of. And you know something? I was sure you'd be drinking Scotch. - You were? - Yeah, I sort of thought you'd like Scotch. - Oh, you did? - Yeah, I figured that- - Just figured I'd like Scotch? - That's right. - You didn't know me. - No, but I- - But you figured I would like Scotch. - Bill, aren't we getting a little involved? - I just think it's funny. - But why is it funny? You're getting me a little bit confused now, Bill. - Am I? I don't know, I just think it's funny, you're thinking that I like Scotch. - Well, it's not terribly important, is it? - No, it's not important at all. Do I get the bourbon? - There it is, right there. - Oh, this one. Okay. - Bill, in a million years, I could never mean anything. - Chuck, it's not important. It's nothing. Cheers and hallelujah. (women chatting indistinctly) Hi. - I think this is where we came in, isn't it? Chuck, what are you trying to do? Get Bill cockeyed so he won't see the floors in the house? - [Chuck] That's the general idea. When I'm finished with him, he's gonna think this place is Buckingham Palace. - It's like Grand Central already. (Chuck and Bill laugh) - [Chuck] Let's take the tour, Bill. Take that along with you, now. - Lead the way. - [Chuck] We got a lot of country to cover. - Well, a fool and whiskey are not easily parted. - Say, I think I'd like a drink myself. - Oh? - Do you mind? - Oh no, no, of course not. Now, it's bourbon, isn't it? - Yep. - Water, soda, on the rocks? - Oh no, on glass. I drink my bourbon on glass. After all, they spend a fortune putting that taste into whiskey. Why spoil it? How about you? Have one, join me. - Oh, I very seldom drink after dinner. - Why now? Why, that's the best time. - Well- - I mean, when the night begins. - Well usually, there are so many things to be done, and... - Like what? - Oh, I mean, you know, things to be attended to. - Yeah? - You sound as if you just sort of relax all the time. - I do. - Well, of course you've got a maid. That makes a difference. - Mm-hmm. Lola does everything. I don't interfere with her job. I stay out of her way. What about you? What do you do? - You mean evenings? - No, I mean any time. All the time. - You mean how do I spend my time? - Yeah, how do you spend your time? - Oh, well there isn't enough time. I'm up to my neck in a million things. - Like what? - [Mary] I don't know, a dozen organizations here that just tear at you. They say, "Help us do this, help us do that." Why, the week's too short to be a week. - Well, do you enjoy that sort of thing? - Well, not all of it. I mean, not all of it. You have no idea. Now, the Library Association is all right. The League of Woman Voters, that's all right. The Musical Society, well, that's kind of fun, and the PTA, well, you've got to. And besides, you know, you wanna be a part of that. But then there's the Y and the Girl Scouts and the Church bazaars, and well, it's like there's no end. I mean, well, don't you? With your kids and all, don't you- - Mm-mm! Nothing. I don't belong to nothing. - At all? - At all. Why do you? - Why? I don't know what you mean by why. Well, it's sort of a responsibility. A woman's got to. I mean, after all, you're part of a community. What else can a woman do? - I'm a woman, and I don't do nothing. - With all that time on your hands? - I spend it being a woman. I mean, that really gases me, just being a woman. - I don't think I understand. (Vicky chuckles) - I know you don't. Being a woman. Well, you know, making myself look better. Going to the beauty parlor. Getting my natural together, having a facial, pedicure, manicure, making myself feel better. Having massages, exercises. Making myself look smart. I go shopping. Dresses, shoes, jewelry. Get myself relaxed. Sleeping, going to a movie, stepping out. Having a ball. You know, that turns Bill on. A woman. And that's what I give him. A w-o-m-a-n that is beautiful and as he says, delicious. (Vicky chuckles) I think I'm about ready for another one of these, okay? - Oh, of course. - Why don't you have one too? Come on, relax a little. - No, I really don't think I'd better. - Better? Better for what? - All right, I will. - At a girl. Live a little. - You know, what you were saying before, that sort of- - Cheers and hallelujah. - What you were saying before, that sort of, well, I mean, you can get away with it in New York, but I mean, up here... - [Vicky] Up here what? - Well, a woman really just can't do that. - Watch me. Oh my, why not? - Well, a woman's expected to. After all, you're part of a community. - Well, I'll tell you, the first community that I'm a part of is the Gunther Family Community. That's number one. - [Mary] I don't think you understand what I'm trying to say. You know, when you live in a neighborhood like this, after all, there are not very many people, everybody knows each other and there are certain community affairs. - Oh, come on. To hell with that. - Well, that's not considered very social up here. - So, let them sue me. - It's not that, it's just that if you expect to be a part- - [Vicky] I don't expect to be a part of anything, nor do I want to be a part of anything, nor am I gonna be a part of anything. You know, I'm me. Bill's Bill and the kids are the kids, and that's the way it's gonna be. Anybody who doesn't like it can sure as hell lump it. I got to you, didn't I? - [Mary] No. No, of course not. I mean, everybody has a right to live as they like. - That's right. - But I was only trying to suggest that if you move up here. - [Vicky] Don't. Don't suggest anything. - But you don't understand, I was trying- - Don't! - I mean because- - Because? - I mean that if you come up here- - Because. Or do you always go around suggesting to customers for this house how they're to behave themselves? - I'm sorry, I don't think you really understand what I'm trying to do. - I don't think you really understand what you're trying to do. (men speaking indistinctly) - Oh, here are the men. Bill, how did you like the house? - Like the man said, Buckingham Palace. - [Chuck] What did I tell you? - Well, I finally got the Missus to take a drink with me. - You did? - Mm-hmm. - Well, that didn't hurt, did it, Mary? I've been trying to get her to relax with a drink after dinner for years, Vicky, and I can't make it. What did you do? - I just twisted her arm. - That must have been the other arm. I've been twisting one for years. Bill, we can't let the girls get ahead of us. You know, the time has come to pop the question, so you'll forgive me for being crass and commercial, but I gotta ask this. Bill, do you like the house? Are you interested in buying? - Yes. - [Chuck] You are? - Yes. - Well then you got yourself a sale. - And Mary, we're interested in selling it to them, aren't we? - That's right. - Well cheers and hallelujah. - [Bill] Hallelujah. - Mr. Gunther, you have bought yourself a house. Put her there, you have bought yourself a house. (Chuck laughs) And may you live a long and happy life in it. Vicky and Bill, Vicky. Bill, I'm going to give your wife a kiss. - Go ahead. - Vicky, happiness, welcome, good fortune, everything. - Thank you. - Mary? - Oh, good luck, Vicky and Bill. - [Bill] Mary, thank you. - Well, if there was ever a time for a drink, I think this is it. - Chuck, first, let's make it official. - Official? - Yeah, let's get something down on paper. - Down on paper. Oh, sure, sure. That's not a bad idea. I don't blame you. What? - Well, a check for a deposit. - Oh sure, well, there's no rush. - Oh, I'd like to do it now. $10,000? - $10,000 is fine. - Charles Robinson. - That's right, Charles Robinson. - $10,000. Now, my lawyer will be up at the end of the week to handle the rest of it. - Sure, Bill. Now listen. Now can we have that drink to celebrate? You know, this is becoming a little solemn. - Well, just one more thing. Could we have a little receipt for the money? - For the money. Of course, just a minute. Mary, excuse me. Here we go. This is a receipt. An acknowledgement of payment of $10,000 towards purchase of our home on 34 Brookdale Road. Total price of house to be $98,200. No, wait a minute. No. This represents, from Bill Gunther. (Chuck mutters indistinctly) Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There. - Right. - That's the document. - Looks good to me. - Well good that we got that over with. Now we can celebrate this wonderful occasion and it is a wonderful occasion for us, and we hope for you, Vicky, and for you, Bill. May you be happy, truly happy, in your new home. Bill, one thing that strikes me as kind of funny, you never asked why we are selling the house. Aren't you curious? - I guess you've got your reasons. - Yes, we got a reason. A reason. This gorgeous mansion is just too big for us, and that's the only reason. See, we got one little girl, Suzie. She's away at her friend's or you'd have met her tonight. She's about to go off to college, and that leaves just Mary and me, and this big house is just too damn big for only us chickens. Well? - Well what? - Aren't you going to ask where we're moving? - Well, I guess you're going somewhere. - Yes, we're going somewhere, but where do you think we'd go, Bill? - [Bill] I don't know. - Now, take a guess. How far? - [Bill] I don't know. - Pretty far away, you'd think, huh? - I hadn't really given it a thought at all. (Chuck laughs) - Well, let me tell you. Let me tell you where the Chuck Robinsons are moving. Right down the road, not a half a mile away. You know what that means? We're going to be neighbors. The Gunthers and the Robinsons are going to be neighbors. (Chuck laughs) Well, listen. You don't have to act like you're sorry about it. - How do you expect us to act? - Bill, you know what this means. This means that we'll be able to see each other. We'll be able to- - What? - Bill, lets all sit down just a second, huh? (Bill groans) Talk about some serious matters, and I think we should, don't you, Mary? Now see, we sort of avoided talking about the situation, and now that you're really, honestly buying the house, there are certain factors, certain considerations. We can't just kid ourselves. - Why don't we just skip that, Chuck? - I'm afraid this is pretty important. - Well, I'm not interested. Skip it. - You see, what I'm trying to say- - I know what you're trying to say. Don't. Just skip it, man. - But you can't just- - Who can't? Can't what? - [Chuck] Let me put it this way. Bill, why do you wanna live up here? - I'll tell you why. It's the schools. That's all it is, period. The schools. I mean, I got two kids. The schools they go to in Harlem just ain't making it. Their schools are turning out maids and porters. You've got good schools up here, and that is all we want. - I can't believe it. All you want? - Like the mama of my children just said. That's it. - Bill, could I ask you a question? Have you ever bought another house? - Nope. - Have you ever lived in a small community before? - Nope. - Well, let me explain something to you. See, you're not just moving into a house. You're moving into a community. And schools, Vicky, schools are just a part of it. I mean, it's a whole way of life. - [Bill] Like what? - Well, everything. I mean, well, clubs and churches and groups and social events, and well, a whole damn life. - Like I said before, screw it. - Bill, don't you realize what'll happen with the people around here when they realize and react to the fact that you've moved in to the neighborhood? - What people? Who cares? - Well Vicky, don't you? Don't you and Bill want yourselves and your children to be part of the community? - Hell no! - What do you mean, no? - [Bill] I mean just what I said. No. Look, we don't care. We're not interested. It doesn't matter. You don't like to hear that, do you? That really bugs you. You see, you're trying to tell me that if we move up here, we gotta act a certain way. Now I'm telling you that we ain't gonna act a certain way whether you like it, the neighbors like it, or anybody. Because we're not interested in the crap that's going down up here. Right? Have we got that right? Now, your neighbor, Mr. Jones down the road, he's got the right to live anywhere he wants to, right? Well, we got that right. - Of course you do, Bill. I was just trying to- - You're just trying to have us be the way that you want us to be so that you can go out and tell the neighbors, "Oh yes, we sold the house to niggers, but they're good niggers. Clean, nice niggers. As a matter of fact, they behave just like you and me. Well, you can't even tell that they're niggers." Well I got some news for you, old Chuck, old buddy. You and this whole community, you better damn well know that we're gonna act like niggers, feel like niggers, and do like niggers, and we're gonna be one hell of a lot different from the rest of the folks around here. Now, have you got any objections? Do you feel like you still wanna celebrate selling this house? - Of course I do. You don't think I'd ever- - I think right now you're pretty damn sorry you sold us this house. - That's not true. - [Bill] It ain't? Well all right, then. So then let's celebrate! We got ourself a house, Vicky. And I wanna thank you, Mr. Robinson. Now, like the man said, it's a wonderful occasion, right? - Right, yes. - [Bill] Okay then, Vicky, how about doing a number for the folks? Come on, child. - [Vicky] Now? - Yes. - [Vicky] Oh no, Bill. - Oh Vicky, come on, we gonna celebrate. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Miss Vicky Ives. A real down soul sister and she is my woman and she can sing. And just a few minutes ago, you said you wanted to hear her sing anyway. - [Chuck] Yes, of course. Vicky, won't you? - Well all right then, Vicky, come on! Let's do a number! - But I don't feel like singing. - [Bill] All right then, well let's have some music because we are going to have a party in my new house. What do we got? Lawrence Well? Well, that certainly won't do. Ah-ha, look out! Brother James Brown and it's brand new. All right, now we really gonna turn it out here this evening and celebrate the right kind of way. All right, who's ready? Come on, Vicky. (upbeat song begins) Let's dance, baby. Oh, come on, baby. - I don't feel like dancing! - No, we gonna dance! Celebrate for these folks. What? - I don't wanna dance. - Come on now. - Oh no, I don't know how to. I really don't. - We are gonna dance the first dance in my house, and we are going to celebrate. Get it. Come on, Mary, come on! Whoo! Go ahead, Chuck. Get in there. Come on, Mary! Ow! Sock it. Come on, show 'em how to do it, baby. You know they ain't got no rhythm. Come on, Mary. Get it. (song stops abruptly) What happened? Wait one minute. One minute and we will flip it over. Whoo! I mean, I am getting warm, you feel me? (upbeat music resumes) Everything's cool. We gonna celebrate now. - Don't you think we oughta... - What, stop? Hell no, man. You got some objections? Listen, this is me and this is the way that I celebrate. You understand? It's the way that I celebrate because my skin is black and this is me. Can you dig that? Huh? Okay now Vicky, come on, honey! Come on, Vicky. Sock it! Let's do it. Come on. You can do better than that, baby! Give it to me! Come on out here. Ooh! - Don't, don't. Please. Let's go. - You wanna dance with me? Wait a minute, now. Can't have no party poopers. Come on, Mary. ♪ Come on and give it to me, baby ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ You afraid of my black skin, is that it? Huh? Well now, what do you think of that? Now everybody's gonna start to call these two nigger lovers, and you know something? They ain't! That's right, go ahead. Turn it off! Turn it off, because everybody- - Stop it! Stop it! - What's the matter? You don't like the way your neighbors are behaving? - This is unfair. It's not fair. - It ain't, huh? - [Mary] We don't deserve this. Maybe you don't realize it, but Chuck and I were ready to make great sacrifices. - How noble! - Let me finish! We were prepared to make every necessary sacrifice, but I'm afraid you wouldn't understand what a thing like that was. Because of what we think is right and just! - Well now, here's a just medal for you. - Oh, not a medal, but the least you could do is try and show some gratitude. - Gratitude, Vicky! Lord have mercy, child. That's it. Now, we got to show some gratitude to these noble white folks who are selling us their lovely house in their lily-white community at a big sacrifice, at 98.2. Chuck, you want some gratitude? - I don't want anything. - [Bill] Feeling kind of miserable now, huh? I mean, all your grand and noble dreams about how you're gonna help us to fit in. How you're gonna help this poor old negro family fit into your community, huh? And maybe, maybe get accepted. In a manner of speaking, of course. In a manner of speaking. And look what you got. Me who don't wanna fit in, who's telling you that you can take all this crap in this lily-white community and shove it! - Except the schools. - Yeah, except the schools. Thank you, Vicky. Except the schools. And my kids are gonna get an education. Now, I don't know what you sold me, Mister, but I sure as hell know what I bought, and I bought my kids an education. You dig that? Now, you got a daughter. She going to college? Huh, is she? Where's she going? - She's going to Sarah Lawrence. - Sarah Lawrence, huh? Vicky, is that a good school? - Yes, it's a good college. - Going to college. And tell me, what's she studying there? - She's interested in psychology. - Psychology. She's interested in psychology and going to college and learning all about it. Now, ain't that nice? College! Mm, mm, mm. You know how many millions of miles I live away from college, huh? Do you know how many years of education I had? Three. Three years. And that was the education of William J. Gunther. And I graduated right behind the jackass at my old man's farm. One jackass behind another. Plowed in them fields sun up to sun down. And you know who taught me how to read and write? I mean, really read and write? She did. Yeah. Vicky. She taught me how to read. Me, a grown man, how to read and write. College? That's for my kids now, and that's why we came up here. To see to it that they go to the right schools that get them in the right college. That's why we're coming up here. Now, what the hell did you think we came up here for, huh? To join your country clubs? To go to your tea parties? Well, let me tell you something, Mr. Chuck Robinson and Ms. Mary Robinson. We don't want no part of it because we don't like it. We don't even want that much part of your life because it's no damn good. Can you dig that, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson? Huh? The only thing that we want from you, your teachers, your knowledge, and your schools, and then maybe someday, our kids, our kids will be able to take it and kick you right in the- And now, yeah. Now we got it right here. See that? We got it. And we wanna thank you, Mr. Robinson, and we wanna thank you, Mrs. Robinson. Now, come on, Vicky. - [Mary] Wait just one minute because I wanna tell you something. You think you're pretty smart, don't you? Well, I don't think you're smart. I'll tell you what I think you are. You're stupid. Stupid. - Oh! - Now, what do you think of that? - Come on, more! Tell me more! - You think I don't dare to? You're stupid because you're the one that's prejudiced. You! You hate the white people as much as you think any one of them hate you. (Bill laughs) More. Because you don't even wanna give them a chance. - [Bill] Come on, more. Give it to me. - You hate the whole white race, and that's stupid! - Come on, give it to me! - I'll give it to you, all right. You have no appreciation of the good things that are in white people, of the good that's in millions of white people. You just hate them all because they're white. You just don't wanna even try to understand them. - Come on, you're doing fine, Mary. - You wanna tear all the white people down. Well, if you came up here, you had no right, no business to come up here just to tear everything down, just to destroy everything. You think I'm afraid to say it to you? Well, I'm not. You're an ignorant, ignorant, stupid, prejudiced negro. - A man, damn it. A man. - [Mary] Negro. Because you hate the white people as a negro. - As a man, and for what they're doing to me as a man, and for what they're going to do to my kids, and for what they're going to do to them as human beings. - Then why don't you come up here and live as a man? Why don't you let your kids live as kids? Why don't you try to live among people as people? - Because I choose not to live like the whites. You get it? I choose not to. Have I got that right? I've got that right! - Mary, let's not go on with this. - What, live in a cage like him, huh? Go the rest of my life playing games with myself? Kidding myself that I'm free? Do you know what this Chuck of yours is? He's a clown! He's nothing! He's a little baby boy playing games with himself. I gotta be like him to live in a house like this and give my kids an education? - What you call games are just getting along with people, being a good neighbor with your neighbors, and there is nothing wrong with it. - That's a white man's crap, and I say stop it. - You're a despicable, destructive creature. - Creature? I'm a creature? Lady, what the hell do you think you are, huh? Yeah, big grand and now normal white folks. Gonna make a big sacrifice and sell us their homes, huh? Big, liberal heroes. - Stop it. Let's just stop. - Oh yeah, you wanna stop. Sure you wanna stop it because you don't like to see yourself. Yeah. - I know what I am and I don't need you to tell me. - [Bill] Yeah, tell me, what are you? I mean, what are you really? I'll tell you what. I know. I am going to show you what you are. Yeah, you watch me. That's right. I'm gonna show you what you are. Now, here's the receipt that says you sold me your house and without it, I have no house, right? Now you watch me, Mr. Big Liberal White Man, because I wanna show you what you are. Now, I'm gonna take this receipt on the count of three and I am going to tear it up. - No, don't. - Now, if you are a big man- - Don't do that. - If you are a big man, you'll stop me, huh? Are you ready? Are you ready? You stop me too. Now get ready because here we go. On the count of three. Now, ready? One. What happened? What happened, Mary? Nobody tried to stop me. Maybe they didn't hear me or something. Let's try again, louder. Now this is two. Two, got it? (speaking foreign language) You ready? Two! Mary, what happened? This is your big chance, come on! Be the liberal. This is your chance. Ready? Okay, it's the last time round. You're last time round. No turning back. Are you ready? You're gonna stop me, right? You're gonna stop me. Stop me! Three! (paper tearing) (Bill laughs) Hm. Mm. Okay Vicky, let's get the hell out of here. - Bill, I don't think- - [Bill] Let's get the hell out of here. All right? All right, so we didn't get the schools. Our kids didn't get the school. But it was worth it. It was worth it to show them exactly what they are. - That is a horrible, nasty man and we don't have to think he's good just because he's a negro. That's wrong. That's just as wrong as the other way. We've got to think of the person, the individual, and we don't want that kind of a person as a neighbor whether he's black, white, or anything. That's all it is. That's all. That's it. Chuck, what else could we do? What else could we do? What else could we do? (easy listening music plays)
