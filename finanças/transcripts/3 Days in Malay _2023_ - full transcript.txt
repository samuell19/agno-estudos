Sons of bitches won't stop comin'. I've got your back, haven't you noticed? I know you do, you always have. [guns banging] Sweet Jesus. One way ticket to hell, either way. [gun bangs] [body thuds] -[intense music] -[machine guns banging] [suspenseful music] [thunder booming] [suspenseful music] [thunder booming] [suspenseful music] -[reflective music] -[men faintly chattering] [reflective music continues] [reflective music continues] [reflective music continues] [reflective music continues] [reflective music continues] [bag thuds] [reflective music] [reflective music continues] -Next, please! -[men faintly chattering] Didn't even have to ask. That's a first. I've been around, ma'am. Don't have to call me ma'am, it's Ms. John Caputo, West New York. Big Italian family, number six of 10- US Marine, champion boxer. Why'd you quit? The Marines or the boxing? Whichever's the better story. I'm bored. Just don't use it as an excuse to make a pass at me. Well, it's all right there in my file. Discharged, boxing was a part of that and then I uh. I uh, I thought driving shipping trucks just outside of DC would be a good idea. And then I got the itch to reenlist and I reenlisted back in the Army after the Marine thing and you know that was-- Right, A for effort, Hemingway. Next! See, I figured I wasn't doing much service for my country driving trucks in the middle of nowhere, right? I wasn't too good at it to be honest. Then I realized, you know? I'd be a better service out here on the front lines. Plus I got a family friend here. Well, I hope you bought something better than your boxing gloves 'cause this place is Hell on Earth. Bunk's in the Holloman building with the rest of D Company. [pensive music] Next, please! Papers, please, don't make me ask you again. [pensive music] [pensive music continues] [footsteps lightly clomping] He was a good soldier. [crying] He was also my friend. [Conte] Even better. Hang in there. We'll all be home soon. [reflective music] I hope so. [gentle music] [hand lightly pats] [gentle music] [James crying] [gentle music] [men faintly chattering] [bag thuds] [men faintly chattering] [footsteps lightly clomping] [men faintly chattering] [men faintly chattering continues] I was just getting used to having this place to myself. Still reading those funny books? Still sketching in the sketchbook? It calms me. You know that. The funny books calm me, you know that. [pensive music] Evans? Dead. [loud whooshing] Let's hope you have better luck. I don't believe in luck. I know you don't. Used to talk my ear off about it. [scoffs] Till you didn't. -[pensive music] -[men chattering] I thought you quit. Yeah, I did. Just like to look at 'em from time to time. [James scoffs] [pensive music] -[crowd cheering] -[punches pounding] Nobody thought Williams was gonna make it to the next round after that nasty fall. But he was really on it. -[punches pounding] -[crowd cheering] Caputo up against the ropes. Caputo [indistinct], and he's reversed it! Caputo puts Williams up against the ropes. [audience cheering] They're stirring up and... [audience cheering] -[body thuds] -Oh! -[suspenseful music] -[audience faintly chattering] -[tense muffled music] -[audience yelling] -It's over, it's over! -[audience murmuring] [Ring Announcer] And the winner, after six rounds, -John "T-Bone" Caputo. -[audience cheering] [reflective music] The referee is calling in some medics to have a look at Williams. This does not look good, ladies and gentlemen. Williams is not responding at all. -[somber reflective music] -[audience murmuring] [John deeply inhales, exhales] [pensive music] [pensive music continues] -[paper warbles] -[pen scribbling] [pensive music] [pen scribbling] [Foley] Another attack on us like on the beach. We're not gonna have able-bodied men left for another. Takes weeks to get anything outta here, especially reinforcement. But you know that. I will remind you that we just had 3000 Marines set foot on base in the last 24 hours. I don't see a scenario where that's enough. [pensive music] We've been through this before and I'm telling you goddammit, we weren't prepared. And I'm trying to prevent history from repeating itself. If we didn't have the 37 mill shredding those sons of bitches, they'd have broken us. Vandergriff says they're coming again. Supply chain headed for regroup, all in. Let me offer you gentlemen some fresh perspective. We are well-outfitted. We have healthier troops and better supplies than last month. And I was just told that a battle of influenza ran through General Aka's camp and killed more than a few of his men. If that's not good tidings, I don't know what it is. And malaria killed ours, sir. Look, look, you're underestimating the enemy. Vandergriff thinks they're gonna repeat the attack. Sector C our weakest link. And if they break through, they take our front and rear, we're done. We understand and appreciate your concern. In that case, why don't we just roll up our tents and get the hell outta here? Because these islands are a dead zone. I mean our boys would be better off in Europe for Christ's sakes. Or even at home! -I agree. -Oh bullshit, you do. I never said I didn't. Why don't you do something about it, goddammit! You reinforce that ridge and you hold the break point! It's a quiet zone in there because, because of the jungle. Denied. Manpower was deemed best used elsewhere. There's no more butter to spread. [sighs] When did you get this news? Rolled down from on high about a week ago. -[suspenseful music] -[Foley scoffs] Sir... [suspenseful music] If you don't want to use me for what I'm good at, and I mean this with all due respect, why the hell am I here? [Harmon scoffs] I get it. [foreboding music] Gentlemen, could you excuse me? I gotta a little paperwork I gotta do. Yeah, paperwork. Ed, you don't like my perspective. Well, let me give you a dose of reality. This military incursion, just like every other US military incursion, is a shit sandwich. And it doesn't matter how you slice it. Every single one of us has to take a bite. Is that understood? -Yes, sir. -[tense music] And do me a personal favor and shave your fucking face. [tense music] We'll reconvene in the morning. -Get some sleep. -Yes, sir. [tense music] [James] How's that food treating ya? [Conroy] Still miss my girls cooking. I tell you that much. Book won't hit ya back. Does when your ex-wife throws it at you from across the kitchen. John Caputo. Benny Conroy. [John] Where you from Benny Conroy? East St. Louis. -Home of the Cardinals? -Yeah, actually. I got a kid brother who play center field for 'em. You a fan? I'm a fan of my brother, not so much baseball. You know, it's not physical enough for me. But I was the captain of the wrestling team in high school. That's good to know, Benny Conroy. Very good to know because I tell you something my friend, you're gonna need all the moves you can get. Haven't had a chance to use it in the battlefield yet. [laughs] Oh yeah, don't worry, you will. Especially when you have a dozen of the Imperials finest on your ass. -Have you ever been in the ring? -[punching bag thuds] Just a spectator from the outside, but I'd love to get on the inside. [John] Is that right, Benny Conroy? Yeah. I hope you know yourself. You know, your strengths, your weaknesses. It's important. [fists lightly pounding] -Got a question for you. -What is it? How does somebody go 10 rounds with Sugar Ray Robinson? Hmm. [laughing] Well that I have no answer for. I don't know. All I can tell you is every man can punch, everyone can fight. Everyone can be the hammer. But not many can be the nail. It's the one who wants it most. But how do you know? You just know. -[fists pounding] -[suspenseful music] It's nice to meet you, Benny Conroy. You too, Caputo. [suspenseful music] Hey James, seems like a good guy. [pensive music] -[suspenseful music] -[birds chirping] [people faintly chattering] -[suspenseful music] -[birds chirping] -[suspenseful music continues] -[birds continue chirping] -[suspenseful music continues] -[birds continue chirping] [footsteps lightly clomping] How's your wife doing? I don't want to talk about it. [footsteps lightly clomping] Hey, boys, I'll be right with you. I gotta go. [Marine 1] Morgan, you off pissing in the bush again? You need to let us know. [Marine 2] You need to keep moving. [Marine 1] You're pissing longer than my grandma. Bet your grandma doesn't have a pecker as long as mine. [Marine 1] You haven't seen hers? It's time for supper anyway. -[man grunts] -[knife squelches] -[body thuds] -[suspenseful music] Fuck. [suspenseful music] [marine panting] Jesus. [suspenseful music] -Banzai! -[air whooshing] -[man yelling] -[blade strikes] [suspenseful music] Yes, yes. [suspenseful music] -[gun bangs] -[tense music] [suspenseful music] -[men grunting] -[punches pounding] [suspenseful music] -[men grunting] -[punches pounding] -[blade squelches] -[men yelling] -[men grunting] -[punches pounding] [man panting] [blade flicks] [man panting] [blade squelches] -[body thuds] -[ominous music] [eerie music] [eerie music continues] [body thuds] [suspenseful music] [footsteps lightly clomping] It looks like one of the patrols didn't sign back in before the next one went out. -Right here. -[pensive music] No, they might have gone straight to the commissary. What are they serving tonight? Meatloaf, cabbage, cornbread, I think. Meatloaf. It ain't that good here. [pensive music] [knife pounds] The hell is this crap? [laughs] It's cornbread. A mick like you wouldn't appreciate it. Oh a mick like me, huh? I'm a mick too, it's allowed. Yeah, grams used to make the best cornbread West of the Mississippi. So juicy, it just like melts in your mouth. Absolute perfection. That's what the girls used to say about me over at Ditmars. Perfection in your mouth. Damn, Simmons, that right there is just disgusting. You're cloggin' my ears with that shit, Simmons. How'd this conversation go from cornbread to-- Don't wanna say it. Give it the respect and deserves. The size of your reproductive organ. [men laughing] -Hey. -Very little. Come on, guys, let's keep it clean. -We got virgin ears over here. -Virgin? Hey, so Murdock, you had to go all medical on my buddy here, huh? Yeah, there's no scientific term for this, boys. They tried to classify it, they can't, okay. It's a whole new species. And let's not forget about the taste, okay. Oh Simmons, I'm trying to have lunch here, huh? Yeah, I hope you know you ruined grand's cornbread for me. Gotta let her know the bad news when I get home. I can tell her tonight when I visit if you want. Save you the trip. [men laughing] I'll let her know about Big Papa Simmons. His buddy here, too. Hey, so Jack, tell me again, you lost your virginity to a, uh, what was that? A goddamn cocker spaniel? Nah, my family was poor so my options were limited to the billy goat out back or a bowl of hot grits. I'll take the grits. Yeah, yeah, I'll take the grits, too. Hey, you one of the new GI's just shipped in? Yep. Ain't nearly enough of you. That's what I'm hearing. Yeah guys, this is John Caputo. He's an old family friend. John, this here is Simmons and Adams, two of the best sons of bitches -to have next to you in combat. -Hey! This here is Jack. He's newer too, but, he's proving us he's pretty promising. Yeah, we'll see about that, Jack. Now while are you seeing about me, I'll be seeing the about your mother. Hey, you got jokes, everyone. -Hey. -[fist banging] -Hey, so it's Caputo? -Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I've seen you fight a few times. Hey, this guy is damn good in the ring. Yeah, I saw you come to Fort Hamilton a few times. You got a helluva swing on ya. Thanks, guys. Yeah, so why'd you quit? You know, took a few years off. But I still stay warm enough to toss up that billy goat when I get home, right, guys? [men laughing] Let's keep this one alive, fellas. I like him. I agree. Please keep me alive. I'd appreciate that. [ethereal music] [ethereal music continues] [ethereal music continues] [footsteps lightly clomping] [Conte] Evening. Haven't seen you around before. -You new? -Yes, sir. But not new to war. I've seen all types before. I know yours well. You've been around too, Father? [ethereal music] Some places I don't wanna repeat. Okay, so at least we have something in common. I figure as much. You ever need a place to sit down and talk to someone, my door is always open for ya. Thank you. [ethereal music] [ethereal music continues] [ethereal music continues] -[footsteps lightly clomping] -[gentle music] [insects chirping] How's that food treating ya? Better than that beef stew my old man made you years ago that gave you food poison. Remember that? Remember? I've been trying to forget that for more than two decades. You still having trouble sleeping? Yeah. Some things never change. [laughs] Thank God I can get this stuff out here. Yeah, man can't asleep, since that last ambush. Evans was manning one of the gun pits next to me. -Everyone was dead. -[gentle music] He made a dash for his pit. He started firing, turned right outta the ammo. -Got shot in the head. -[somber music] Died, eyes staring at me, lifeless. [scoffs] [gentle music] Had Imperial soldiers in the front, hellfire behind me. I had to make a dash. Got through without a scratch on me. [somber music] Dynamite. That's what scares me. Seeing one of those things coming at you in the middle of the night. It's the longest goddamn moment in my life. [somber music] You know what I don't understand? Outta all the places you could be, why this God forsaken place? Maybe I came to watch over you, James. [James scoffs] You know we're not kids anymore, right? I did a lot of growing up after you left me. I know. I know, but hey, don't forget, I was there when you had your first street fight, right? What were you? 10, 11-years-old? You had that kid up against some fence, right? You had him up against the fence and you were banging his head against it over and over. The kid was crying his eyes out. But so were you. -[both laughing] -Yeah, I was crying. Of course, I was crying. You're yelling, why are you crying? You're beating his ass. Hey, he had 10 pounds on you, was a couple of years older than you. You were winning. You should have been celebrating, not screaming. I was so upset with you. Dominic Roberto. [John laughs] Dominic Roberto was his name. Dominic Roberto. I don't know if you remember, he had a pretty good looking sister back then. I know you remember. You lost your virginity to her. [John laughs] [scoffs] Look at us. Chopping it up like a couple of old buddies. We are, aren't we? [gentle music] The good old days. The only problem is, they always end the same way. [gentle music] [gentle music continues] -[pen scribbling] -[gentle music] [suspenseful music] [Imperial soldiers speaking in foreign language] [Imperial soldiers continue speaking in foreign language] [suspenseful music] [Imperial soldiers speaking in foreign language] [suspenseful music] [insects buzzing] [pencil scribbling] [birds chirping] [footsteps clomping] [pencil scribbling] Not bad. Thank you, sir. Sit down, at ease. Looks familiar, too. Yeah, it's my roommate. I don't believe we met, uh. You're the one with the other troops? That's right, sir. Sergeant Edward Foley. And I've heard a lot about you, sir. John Caputo. I heard about you too there, John. Gunner sergeant. And may I say, out-fucking-standing job. Thank you, sir. By the way, John, whenever you heard about me, don't believe all of it. Only half of it's true. Which half would that be, sir? Depends on which half you heard. My jokes are terrible. It's okay sir, we've got nothing but time out here. I know, well. Times about all I got here, John, 'cause I sure as hell don't get any goddamn respect. I tell you that. Where you from? West New York, Buffalo-Niagara. -No kidding. -Yes, sir. Small world, Syracuse. Wow, okay. Many locals out here, sir? -A few. -Yeah. Most of them seem to be keeping away from me. From you? -You can count on that. -[John laughs] -I got a question, sir. -Yeah. Aren't you a little gray around the beard to be a master sergeant? Look who's going to kettle black? First of all, I'm still one of West Point's finest. Don't forget that. I understand, sir. Are they coming for us, sir? [pensive music] What do you think? I'll tell you, John, we're like chess pieces out here. They place us where they see fit. We get company, some of us cover the supply chain over at the beach, others at blood ridge. Only problem is, is that some of the chess pieces are a little chipped. Some things change. -Some stay the same, sir. -[pensive music] Ain't that the truth? Yes, sir. Now listen, John, you ever wanna talk any hometown gossip, you can come to my office anytime. [hand slaps] By the way, if do another little sketch there, try one of me, without the scar, and up here. Make me look like Clark Gable or something. -[hand playfully slaps] -See you around. [gentle music] -[dramatic music] -You know, Father, I'm only here because my commanding officer thought it'd be a good idea. Silly me, I thought you enjoyed the conversation. No, I do. I just thought you could use your time a little better than on me. Plus, you can't beat the inevitable. -What's that? -[gentle music] Death. Death is a part of life. It's nothing to be afraid of. How do you know? That's between you and God. [gentle music] And bang, shot in the head, dead. That's it, it's over. Is that what you believe? I don't know what I believe. That's your answer there. You haven't found it yet. [gentle music] This all sounds like a riddle. Everybody's path is different. This is yours. [gentle music] Still can't sleep? No. But the whiskey helps. [laughing] The good stuff. Preacher, you drink whiskey? I'm from Philly. [gentle music] Are there any more of these whiskey drinking preachers out here? A few of us for sure. [laughing] Enough to win this war? We'll see. -[James scoffs] -[gentle music] -[lips smacking] -[Bes laughing] Shit. If you're trying to be romantic, that ain't working. No, I'm late. You're what? No, I mean I'm late for my shift. Gotta go. Gonna pick this up later? Eh, depends, how much busy work Harmon decides to drop on my desk. I know what you mean. Yep, well, I guess I'm gonna hit the gym. Well, don't use up all your energy. I'm not a very giving lover. [Bes laughs] [birds chirping] A scout team was spotted here about a week ago. They they vanished, if that's what you wanna call it. The second one this month? Yeah, well, I was hoping they went AOL, washed up in a boat somewhere. But you know better than that. Look right here. This is where the Japs were spotted with their supplies. -That's a cave. -Yeah. Do we have eyes on them? No, can't get within 200 yards of that without considering yourself dead. Probably what happened to the scout teams. They're hiding the numbers. How do you know? [tense music] Do you get paid every time you question me? -I wish I did. -Oh, that's just what I do. Do you understand that? Show me when you can do. -Enough. -It's what I do! You understand that? -It's what I do! -Enough! [tense music] Listen, Ed, you're not wrong, but I can't do much for you. You can take one squad into the pits, -but God help you. -[suspenseful music] They say nothing lasts forever. I was just wondering if I could be your nothing. James, that is the worst damn line I have ever heard, in an entire base of worst damn lines. Try again. -Try again? -Yeah. Is that an invitation? No. A request? Maybe. So where'd you go to school? Boston. Mm. That's not gonna work. What's wrong with Boston? Boston Braves. That's where the Babe played his last season of his career. Can't be associated if you're from that area. What babe are you talking about? Ruth? Babe Ruth? The Great Bambino? -Oh. -Babe Ruth? -Oh. -The Sultan on Swat? -Okay. -The King of Crash? Okay and what do I have to do with Babe Ruth's career? [object clanks] Don't go anywhere. I am not done with you yet. [pensive music] [pensive music continues] [pensive music continues] Son of a bitch. So where were we? Sorry. Just don't know if I can be associated with anyone from the area where the Babe had his worst career. You'll be back. Don't count on it. You will be. Yeah, you're right. [laughing] Have some better lines for me then. [gentle music] [gentle music continues] That a boy, come on, there you go! -[fists pounding] -There you go. -Come on, Robinson. -[fists pounding] -Hey, there you go! -[men cheering] [men chattering] Keep your eyes on him, Robinson. Keep your eyes on him. Come on, Robinson. Keep your eyes on him, Robinson. -Come on. -[men chattering] Come on, there you go. [men chattering] -[fist pounds] -[men exclaiming] Oh, hey, Jesus! Keep your eyes on Conroy, not Caputo. -Come on. -You all right, James? Shake it off, shake it off. You're still a good fighter, man. Would you take your eyes off the Imperial Army, on the battlefield, James? [tense music] Fuck you. I'm just saying, you know the fight in front of you is the most important, that's all. Sounds good to me. You should listen to your friends. Yeah, what about Evans? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, James. -What about it? -Your last fight. -Same damn thing. -Not here guys, come on. Hey, what damn thing? What's he talking about, John? I don't know how you know about that. Now's not the time or the place. When is the time? Gimme those gloves. -Right now is-- -Here you go. -Now's the time. -[tense music] -Alright. -[dramatic music] Put the gloves on! [dramatic music] Put the gloves on! [dramatic music] That's what you want to do? Yeah. Right now! This is how you want it, James? Yeah, like this. Or are you gonna run away again? -I got, James. -Hook me up. It's been a long time coming. [men chattering] -How many rounds we doing? -All the way. You sure this is a good idea, John? I think he's right. It's been a long time coming. -Let's go! -[dramatic music] James, I've been wanting to-- -[fists pounds] -[men exclaiming] Oh God, come on, hit him again. -Getup, get up and fight. -Put up. -Come on, John. -[fists pounding] [men exclaiming] -John, John, come on. -[dramatic music] James, James! -[fists pounding] -[dramatic music] [men exclaiming, yelling] Get off me! -You were my brother. -[dramatic music] Go cool off, Robinson. Take the gloves off me, boys. -Yeah. -Let's take a break. -Caputo, what happened? -It's okay, boys. What's that all about? -You all right? -Long history. I'll be fine. Thank you, boys. -Jesus. -Yo, hey, take it easy. Somebody's gotta be the nail. That's okay. -We know who that is. -[pensive music] [men exclaiming, cheering] [pensive music] [men chattering] [John] I've got your back, haven't you noticed? [James] I know you do, you always have. [somber reflective music] -[gun banging] -[dramatic music] [somber reflective music] [somber reflective music continues] [water trickling] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] -[fists lightly pounding] -[men chattering] [iron clanking] [men chattering] [suspenseful music] [men chattering] [suspenseful music] [machine whirring, clicking] [paper tears] -[suspenseful music] -[typewriter keys tapping] [tense music] [suspenseful music] Sir, this just came in. [tense music] -This is real? -Absolutely. Sooner than I thought. [tense music] Read this. [tense music] I told you to trust me. Let's hope those Marine reinforcements count for something. Request three more battalions to help cover the ridge with the other companies. -That's a request? -[tense music] It's an order. Your surveillance is not your job. Maybe it should be. -Airplane, say, aw. -Aw. Aw! Hmm, swish and spit, soldier. 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off. -Got it? -Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much. Hmm, well, you look a little nasty on the inside, but on the outside you look all right. What'd you say you did again? -Push ups. -Jump ropes. So which is it? -Pushups, ma'am. -Jump ropes. -Wait. -Pick one, it's not hard. If you're gonna lie, pick a good lie and rehearse it a little and you know, communicate it to the troops. -He was diving, ma'am. -Swimming. -We were swimming. -We were driving. -Yeah. -Yep, we were, ma'am. You gotta let me do the talking next time. We tried that, it didn't go to well, now did it? Well you know, you white folks ain't got no rhythm. -Jesus. -You gotta be quick with it. [laughs] Oh, now you got some rhythm? Wasn't doing that when he was fighting James, though. -[gun bangs] -[body thuds] [men yelling] [dramatic music] Looks like our guy, James, has left the building. Wouldn't be the first time. Yeah. I don't know what it is with you two. You know, James is not the type to hold a grudge. [reflective music] Looks like he forgot something. Looks like you found something. That is James' favorite whiskey. [reflective music] [aircraft engine whirring] So I ended up going to my mama's house and she hits me with, so you going to the war? [John laughing] Yeah, so I was trying to get her in a good mood. So I tickled her feet and that's when I told her I was going to war. [John laughs] You hear that? I do. That ain't us. -Take cover! -Move! -[men yelling] -[aircraft engine whirring] -[bombs exploding] -[men yelling] -You boys need company? -Move, move! [men yelling] -[plane engines whirring] -[dramatic music] [bombs whirring, exploding] [aircraft engine whirring] [bombs whirring, exploding] Okay, let's go, let's go. [people faintly chattering] Go, go, come on, come on. [people faintly chattering] That son of a bitch. That son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Fucking fighter jets! The first attack is directly on the outpost. -Hello? Hello? -[aircraft engine whirring] [bomb exploding] [dialogue drowned out by rumbling] [men yelling] [body thuds] [men yelling] -[gun bangs] -[man grunts] [men grunting] -[body thuds] -[men yelling] -[fist pounds] -[man grunts] -[body thuds] -[dramatic music] [man grunting] Hey, I got you, you son of a bitch. [gun bangs] -[body thuds] -[tense music] [Foley panting] You okay? Get these sons of bitches outta my office. [men yelling] -[gun bangs] -[woman gasps] -[dramatic music] -[body thuds] -[blade squelches] -[man yelling] -[dramatic music] -[body thuds] -[gun bangs] -[man grunts] [body thuds] [somber reflective music] If you wanna shoot him, you have to shoot me first. -[gun bangs] -[dramatic music] [guns banging] [suspenseful music] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [men grunting] [guns banging] [suspenseful music] Get ready, here they come! -[dramatic music] -Fuck. [suspenseful music] -[Ellie crying] -[tense music] So how good is your wrestling? We about to find out. [suspenseful music] [men grunting] -[bodies thudding] -[men yelling] -[dramatic music] -[object pounding] Go, go, go, go, go, go. -[men yelling] -[bodies thudding] -[men grunting] -[suspenseful music] -[men yelling] -[fists pounding] -[man yelling] -[suspenseful music] [dishware clanking] -[body thuds] -[suspenseful music] -[men yelling] -[bodies thudding] -[fists pounding] -[men yelling] -[knee pounding] -[man grunting] -[suspenseful music] -[men panting] [man speaking in foreign language] [foreboding music] -[gun bangs] -[body thuds] [suspenseful music] -[door creaks] -[pensive music] Praise Jesus. Hallelujah. [pensive music] You wanted some action, huh? I wasn't ready for this. Yeah, nobody was. What do we do now? -Wait? -We wait. We lost anybody in the air raid? Uh, no. [door creaks] Jesus Christ, hold your fire. It's a fucking massacre out there. -Sorry, preach. -You're forgiven. Were you aware of this? I warned General Harmon about this weeks ago. He didn't think they were gonna hit the FOB directly. His intel told him there were only a few hundred Japs, but yeah, I knew there'd be more. So it's safe to say, we're outnumbered. Yeah, it is. I'd like to know how they got in. I was told when I shipped in this place was impenetrable. Same. The breach came from behind the commissary. That's a blind spot from the watch tower. Blind spot? That sounds like bullshit to me. Guys, they just killed dozens of soldiers, medical personnel and all the staff. They're here to kill every single one of us. No shit. All right, look, this could be a diversion. Not sure. The air raid, supply chain, got most of the beach side covered. So I'll be goddamned how they got through. But they're here. My guess is they're gonna come in hard right down the middle by the ridge. -John? -Yes, sir? There's a pass down the river. That's the one clear shot we got from the jungle to the perimeter. You're a gunner sergeant, right? -Yes, sir. -All right. I want you to take a small squad with you. We got three pits set up right at the entrance, at the fork in the road. And John, I'm gonna need you to hold that son of a bitch. Yes, sir. John, at all cost. -Yes, sir. -[pensive music] How about you? You got any combat experience? I'll take that as a yes. I'm gonna take a handful of you with me. We're gonna back up anybody here at the base who needs it. We got a few thousand people here and I intend to keep it that way. Those of you will remain here are gonna do exactly that. You're gonna stay here and you're gonna keep this place safe. -Am I clear? -Yes, sir. -Am I clear? -Yes, sir. -Any questions? -No, sir. All right, we got a plan. -John? -Yes, sir. -[lips smacking] -[Ellie crying] All right, listen. 20 yards right down there. That's where you gonna find a trail. Take you right to the river, all right? We're gonna clear the base. I'm gonna find every goddamn soldier I can for ya. And bring him back. -Yes, sir. -[dramatic music] Hey. Hey! -[object thuds] -[suspenseful music] That thing work? Yeah, as far as I know. All right, good. Scout group's up on a cliff overlooking the beach, that's assuming that they're still alive. If they are, they're gonna be looking at any movement right towards you. -So expect a call. -Okay, sir. All right? All right. On my six, let's move. -John? -[dramatic music] Let's go, Robinson, Murdock, Conte, Simmons, Jack, Conroy, fall in. [suspenseful music] Let's move. [Conte] Hey, boys, look like we found a treasure set. Woo, yes, we did. [suspenseful music] [bullets jangling] Is it Christmas yet? I don't have a calendar. [suspenseful music] I haven't known what day it is for months. Last time I checked it was your mama's birthday. Nice try, jack offs. All right, enough! Let's load up. [Simmons] We still got a problem though. What's that? A few hundred men holding on a thousand plus yard jungle against God knows how many Japanese soldiers. [heavily exhaling] All right, listen up. [heavily exhaling] It's gonna be a suicide mission, but this is what we do. -Any questions? -No, sir. Preacher, I think we're gonna need some prayers. Let's save it until we need it. All right, let's fall out. [suspenseful music] Grab the ammo box, let's go. -[men grunting] -[suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] -Set these up over here. -All right, boys. -Right here. -Yeah, that's right. [men indistinctly chattering] -[suspenseful music] -[footsteps clomping] [ominous music] [reflective music] [foreboding music] Let me see. James, you can loosen up. Using a lot of energy sitting on your ass there. -I'm fine. -Keep it down over there. Kenny and myself trying to think. Sounds like maybe you're trying too hard. I think you need to get a new guy a boxing lesson here, Johnny Boy. Maybe, I will. Hey, you throw in some ballroom dancing with it, I'm game. Hey, it's actually not a bad idea. Yeah, I got a girl back home I'm supposed to marry, but she said I gotta learn how to dance first. Or you can't come home? That's what she said. Jesus. Sounds like a keeper. Well, matter of fact, she is, a beautiful woman. Yeah? What's her name? Her name is Judy, Judy Watts. Me and my friends, all due respect, use to call her, Judy, Judy, Judy, with the hammock booty. [men laughing] Make you just want to bite it. Well, all right, then. She from Kansas City. Y'all ever been? The Kansas side or Missouri side? Missouri side, of course. Then no, on purpose. [laughing] Hey, not unless his mom was there. Ain't that right, Jack? You know I wasn't gonna say that, but you got it. I drove a truck through there once. Through his mama? [men laughing] Well I'll tell you this, we get out this hell hole, y'all should come. They got some real, pretty, pretty girls. Let's just hope there's more Dorothy's out there than Toto's, you know what I'm saying? [laughing] Yeah. Man, I tell you, I really miss her. I just hope I'm worth waiting for. Yeah, you are man. We all are. -[faint booming in distance] -[crickets chirping] Hey, say, any of you city boys got a family back home? Yeah, I got me a wife. Victoria, been married two years. What about you lover boy? Shit, nah. Not yet. Oh, yeah. Any candidates? Eh? Gotta get a few things outta my system first. Like what? I don't know, it's not in the dictionary yet. Y'all hear that? Hear what? Exactly. It's quiet. [suspenseful music] [ominous music] [people indistinctly chattering] Anybody got the time? A quarter till midnight. -Way past my bedtime. -Mine, too. [phone ringing] Yeah? [Com Grunt] You have the entire Imperial Army headed right towards you. Copy. [eerie music] They're coming! [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] -[guns cocking] -[tense music] [suspenseful music] [foreboding music] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [dialogue drowned out by gunfire] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] They're coming right down the middle. -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [men screaming] [dialogue drowned out by gunfire] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [dialogue drowned out by gunfire] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] -[men continue yelling] -[guns continue banging] [men screaming] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] -[men continue yelling] -[guns continue banging] [men screaming] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [dialogue drowned out by gunfire] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [dialogue drowned out by gunfire] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] -Holy shit! -[dramatic music] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] -Foley! -[guns continue banging] [body thuds] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [suspenseful music] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [suspenseful music] [guns banging] [man grunts] -[guns banging] -[men groaning] -[pipe pounds] -[man grunts] -[man groaning] -[suspenseful music] -[men yelling] -[tense music] -[blade squelches] -[man gurgling] -[men yelling outside] -[suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [guns banging] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [music abruptly ceases] -[suspenseful music] -[guns banging] All in! -[suspenseful music] -[guns banging] [John yelling] -[suspenseful music] -[guns banging] [guns banging] [man yells] [suspenseful music] -[guns banging] -[suspenseful music] [men yelling, grunting] -[guns banging] -[suspenseful music] [reflective music] -[guns banging] -[suspenseful music] [reflective music] -[guns banging] -[suspenseful music] [reflective music] [men sighing, panting] It's about time! It's about fucking time! [crying] We're clear! [Conte sighs] [men sighing, panting] -Thank God. -[reflective music] [somber music] [men panting, sighing] [reflective music] -[men crying, sighing] -[pensive music] [pensive music continues] [Simmons] You all right? Yeah. Hmm. [mumbles] No, you're doing that thing with your eyes when you lie. You're lying. No, I ain't lying. I just need some sleep. It's okay. Sleep. I'll take first watch. I suggest everybody get some rest while you can. You don't have to try too hard to convince me of that. Wake me up when we're in Valhalla. Where's Valhalla? You'll find out in the next life. How about you? Somebody's gotta keep watch, you rest. Hey preacher, I could really use that prayer right about now. Don't worry about it, I already said it. How you think Caputo made it back? It wasn't luck. Get some rest, that means you too. Yeah, you know better than anyone. I can't sleep. Doctor says insomnia or something. Fine, suit yourself. [scoffs] That's it? No lecture, no bullshit? Nope. I'm too damn tired. I'm just gonna sit. Be my guest. You're still pissed off at me. Yeah, I've been pissed for more than half my life at you. How'd you find out about that thing in that ring? I saw it in the file. The file? How could I not look? I just don't get, why didn't you come to me? I was dealing with some things. Oh, you were dealing with some things. I was coming to terms with things. I didn't want to involve you and the family. I thought sending all those letters would be enough, but obviously it wasn't. When I heard you were out here, I thought, I have to get back at it. So this is once more to the fray, ole friend? You always were the all or nothing. But you know that. If you really gave a shit about me, you'd have stayed in contact all those years. And that was my mistake. So now you're just making up for lost time? Maybe I am. [James laughs] You know, I actually heard from your pops a few years after I left. He always had a way of tracking me down, unlike you. [pensive music] [helmet pounding] [John grunts] [John cries] I miss him. Yeah, so do I. You should have been at the funeral, James. Yeah, I was dealing with some things. And there's not a day that goes by I don't regret it. You never weren't welcome. Yeah, you could have fooled me. Listen to me. I'm done talking about this! [somber reflective music] [somber reflective music continues] [somber reflective music continues] [somber reflective music continues] [soldier deeply inhales, exhales] -[pensive music] -[fire blazes] [ominous music] [door creaks] -[suspenseful music] -[footsteps lightly clomping] [tense music] [Boggs heavily sighs] Shh, with the breathing. You'll get us killed. Calm down. You understand? Calm down. Let's go. [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] Bingo. Do you know how to use one of these? Yeah, first assignment was communications. I know these things like the back of my hand. Is it gonna work? [machine clicks, whirs] [birds chirping] [men faintly chattering, laughing] [suspenseful music] [men faintly chattering, laughing] [suspenseful music] Obviously, we got company. All right, let's not get too comfortable. All right, you three. We got empty pockets of people here who still need help. When you get there, I want you to split up in groups of three, okay, that way they think there's more of us. What they don't know is not gonna hurt 'em. All right? Move on. -Go. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -[suspenseful music] Move on. [suspenseful music] All right, West right there. That's a trail to get to the scout troop. You're gonna need some help. I need you to do it, all right? All right. Make your mama proud, all right? Yes, sir. [suspenseful music] -[soldier exhales] -[suspenseful music] [gun bangs] [body thuds] [Jack] You never played cards before? -I play Go Fish. -[men laughing] -Counting cards, Adams. -He's counting cards? -No, you're counting cards. -I'm not counting cards. Somebody's cheating, I'm gonna deal the next game. -You hold up-- -You can't even count. -You can't even count cards. -You put the cards in. [Conroy fidgeting, grunting] How long was I out for? Long enough. What about him, he get into the whiskey again? Nope. But he's still pissed off with me. Oh yeah, I know. I heard that shit, y'all gave me nightmares. Y'all keep going back and forth, sound like the damn enemy. I'm surprised ain't seen that second wave before sunrise. How the neighbors doing? Looks like they're having a party. Shit. I'm not playing Go Fish, okay. This is five card card poker. I know, but it's called poker. You're gonna turn the cards in. This ain't Go Fish, son. -And they ain't invite us? -These are my cards though. -I like these cards. -These are the same cards. [leaves rustling] You hear that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. In positions! -Let's go, get in position. -[suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [suspenseful music continues] [footsteps lightly clomping] [pensive music] [gentle reflective music] [gentle reflective music continues] [gentle reflective music continues] Jesus. [gentle reflective music] [gentle reflective music] [zipper reverberates] Guess those prayers of yours worked. [Conte] Just keep the faith, brother. [bomb explodes] [suspenseful music] [bomb explodes] -[men grunting] -[eerie music] -[men yelling] -[ominous music] -[guns banging] -[suspenseful music] [air whooshing] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] -You good? -Yeah. -You sure? -Yeah, I'm good. -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [Conroy grunts] Shit, I'm hit, I'm hit. [grunts] Oh, God! -[men yelling] -[guns banging] I'll be okay. [grunts] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] -[men yelling continues] -[guns banging continues] -Reload! -[men grunting] -[suspenseful music] -[guns banging] [man yelling] [guns banging] [body thuds] [guns banging] -[Conroy groaning] -Keep the pressure on. [guns banging] -[man grunts] -[eerie music] [ominous music] -[bullets clanking] -[suspenseful music] -[guns banging] -[men yelling] [John grunts] -[guns banging] -[metal clanking] [John grunts] -[guns banging] -[metal clanking] [muffled reflective music] [pensive reflective music] [pensive reflective music continues] [pensive reflective music continues] [Conroy grunting] -[John panting] -[tense music] -[John continues panting] -[tense music continues] I got you, I got you, John. I got you. I got you, I got you. -[water pouring] -[John grunts] -Thank you. -Don't mention it. Just in case we don't get to later. We will. Why they keep on coming? We keep mowing them down. And they just keep coming, they keep coming. I'm killing 'em and they just keep on coming. Goddamn. That's the way they are. I spent years around them. They're not like us. I'm gonna make it outta here, God willing, the creek don't rise. -[gun bangs] -[Conroy grunts] [suspenseful music] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] -[men continue yelling] -[guns continue banging] -[men continue yelling] -[guns continue banging] -[men continue yelling] -[guns continue banging] -[men continue yelling] -[guns continue banging] [dialogue drowned out by gunfire] -[men yelling] -[guns banging] [John grunting] -[man gasps] -[suspenseful music] Fuck. [pensive music] [pensive music continues] [insects chirping] It's my fault. [Conte] Man, no, it's not. Yeah, it is. You remember that talk we had about death? How do you feel about it now? He's gone. Is he? Look, the only thing that stopped is his body. But what's in here and in here is out there somewhere. Where? Where! I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. Brothers Conroy and Murdock, they're waiting for us somewhere. That's real nice. But before they get too far, why don't you tell 'em to stick around a little bit. Help us get through this. [Conte sighs] God, our Father, by raising Christ, your Son, you destroyed the power of death and opened for us the way to eternal life. As we remember before you, our brothers Conroy and Murdock, we ask your help for all who shall gather in their memory. Grant us the assurance of your presence and grace by the spirit you have given us through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. -Amen. -[reflective music] [John deeply inhales, exhales] [reflective ethereal music] [pensive music] Got a present for you. [grunts] He left something behind. [laughs] Thanks. I don't know man. I'm thinking maybe when this thing ends, we create our own brand. Maybe call it, Peacemaker Whiskey. Got a pretty good ring to it. What do ya think? May be a good time for a toast? Nah, save it. I'm half sleep as it is. We need to be alert. It's been a couple hours since that last wave and I don't like that. You know... Your enemy has to sleep too. Maybe they're just waiting for the right time. Could be both, I suppose. [scoffs] He was a good man. A good soldier. When we deployed out here, we made a pact. Him. Evans, myself. We promised we'd have each other's back. And I failed on both fronts. No, you didn't, James. This is war, you did what you could. You got another one of those? Williams. Huh? The boxer that I fought, first name, Lawrence. I still see his face every night, just like you do Evans. Different thing. Killing a man on the battlefield and killing someone in the ring. People cheering all around you. He had a hell of a swing, this kid. Better than me. He was faster than me. He was stronger than me. I got lucky. And that's why I keep telling you, I don't believe in luck. Doctor told me after the fight that he had a precondition, something. I just sped up the process. It doesn't matter to me though. I'm still responsible, right? I sent that family flowers every month. I sent them money every month, for a year. They just keep sending it back. I was discharged soon after that. [laughing] So... Then I'm thinking, hey, John, drive a truck, a shipping truck across country. Maybe it'll take your mind off everything. But you know what? It did the opposite. I thought about it more and more. Thought about it every day. It made me crazy. A couple years later, and a failed marriage, here I am sitting with some punk kid, used to eat my parents outta house and home. Wanted to bang my little sister. [James scoffs] You gonna get some sleep? What about you? Three days? I'm good, I ain't slept yet. I ain't gonna. Then I'm staying up too. Big man. I gotta present for you, here. Remember when we were kids and we used to do all those sketches? All those family portraits? [pensive music] There was only one person missing from those photos. [pensive music] [reflective music] [reflective music continues] [James crying] [reflective music] [reflective music continues] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [suspenseful music continues] Jesus Christ. [laughing] We thought we lost ya. Yeah, I'm sure. I see the New York City boys and the good reverend are still up. Ah, you know, that's the city that never sleeps. Yep. This time it works to our advantage. Let's just hope the West New York and the city get along well enough to get us all outta here. It's that bad over there, huh? Real bad. I'll have a drink to that. You know what? You first. [pensive music] And what do I toast? When we get outta here, I'll let you both know. [scoffs] Sounds good to me. [John coughs] It's that good stuff. Your turn. [coughing] Yeah, I'm with you. I got something big I wanna tell y'all but, I'mma save it for a special occasion. I'll tell you mine now. -What's that? -More whiskey. [men laughing] All right, I'll drink to that. Whatever it is, we get outta here, we're gonna have some beers at the pub. We'll probably get lucky. We know the rev won't. [men laughing] -[airplane engine whirring] -[suspenseful music] Take cover! -[gun banging] -[suspenseful music] [John yelling] [bullets dramatically pound] [body thuds] [dramatic music] [bombs explodes] [dramatic music] I can't fucking do this. I can't fucking do this. I can't fucking do it. -Oh, no! -We're not quitters! -You're not quitting! -I can't go on. We're not quitters. [suspenseful music] [bomb explodes] Banzai! [somber reflective music] Japs, they won! [somber reflective music] [dramatic music] [somber reflective music] -[gun thuds] -[men screaming] -[objects pounding] -[men yelling] -[objects continue pounding] -[men continue yelling] -[blood squelches] -[James grunting] [men grunting] -[objects pounding] -[men yelling] -[head bashes] -[reflective music] -[man gasping] -[John grunting] [bones cracking] [John sobbing] [men yelling] -[fists pounding] -[men screaming] [body thuds] -[men grunting] -[objects pounding] -[head pounds] -[man grunts] -[blade squelches] -[man gasps] [reflective music] -[blade squelches] -[reflective music] -[John grunting] -[men yelling] -[gun squelches] -[man yells, groans] [reflective music] -[gun bangs] -[Conte spits] [reflective music] -[men yelling] -[feet pounding] [body thuds] [reflective music] [men yelling] [body thuds] [men yelling, grunting] -[fists pounding] -[reflective music] -[head bashing] -[men yelling] [James yelling] -[James sobbing] -[somber reflective music] [aircraft engine whirring] Incoming! [aircraft engine whirring] [suspenseful music] [bombs exploding] [bombs continue to explode] [bombs continue to explode] [high-pitched whirring] [pensive music] Ah, fuck, pressure. Keep the pressure on it. Here. Goddamn it! -Tight. -[reflective music] Hey. I wanna thank you. -For coming out. -[reflective music] -For watching my back. -[John panting] You didn't do a very good job, you prick. Well, I've never been too good a mush, but I'm here, you fucking ass wipe. Keep the pressure on it. [James laughing] You wanna know what I was gonna drink to? No. You save that. Ammo, what have we got? We out. -[John panting] -[James laughs] [gentle music] -[men panting] -[reflective music] [James coughs] [reflective music] Let's do this. [laughs] Let's do it. [James grunting] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [dramatic music continues] [uplifting music] [uplifting music continues] [uplifting music continues] You didn't believe me when I said I'd come back for ya, huh? Hey, soldier, come here! [uplifting music] [uplifting music continues] [uplifting music continues] [uplifting music continues] [uplifting music continues] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [dramatic music continues] [dramatic music continues]
