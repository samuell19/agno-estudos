I would like to invite all who are present here to take a moment to call to mind, our need for forgiveness. Let us pray. Chef. Welcome. I'm Willem Faust. Ecanus. I like that. - Shall we? - Yeah. So, tell me, is that your real name? Yeah. It's very fitting, wouldn't you say? Fate, I guess. I think so. Please, take a seat. Well, tell me a little bit about yourself. Um, I've been cooking since I was a kid. Mm-hmm. Uh, my grandmas, uh, taught me how to make - traditional Mexican dishes... - Yes. ...which has become a passion for all kinds of foods. Um, I specialize in Mediterranean, Indo-Asian infusion, uh, several types of... No, please, Chef, stop. I don't care. Well, I do, but I already know. I've talked to your previous kitchens and they all say the same thing. "Chef is a Creative Tour de Force. He's fast. He's reliable." We could skip the foreplay. Yeah, okay. I just want to know the man who I'm trusting to make my customers happy. Of course, yeah. Well, what do you want to know? Tell me about your family. Well, um, I'm Mexican. Mm-hmm. Um, I'm very close with my family. Uh, I live with my parents, my siblings, my Abuela, and every Sunday, we get together with all the cousins. So family is important to you then? Yes. The most important thing actually. Well and food, obviously. Good. Well, a family man is a trustworthy man. Uh, my next question is one that I hate to ask, but I must. Okay. Are you here legally? Yes. And what about your family? I'm sorry, I don't understand what that has to do- I don't mean to pry, but as you might be able to tell, I'm an immigrant myself. Well, um... My parents and Abuela don't have papers. I understand. That must put some pressure on you and your family. Sometimes. I think you're gonna fit in very well here. The previous chef was a little too... you know, sometimes we have high turnover rates, but don't let that be a source of concern to you. So it's about finding the right people and that's no easy task in the restaurant business. This isn't a job for everyone. It can be grueling. Mr. Faust, I wouldn't be here if I didn't know what I was going to sign up for. Well, that's all I need to know. Let's make this official, shall we? Here is your home away from home. It may not look like much, but my kitchens are a little different. I believe in equality, Chef, every person an essential part of my operation. As a result, there's no real hierarchy. Sous chefs are equal to the preppers and you are no more important than our washes because we all fail if someone doesn't do their job, wouldn't you agree? You're absolutely right. This is Michael, my kitchen manager, and also my right hand. He makes sure things get done, takes care of any issues. He'll pop in from time to time, and keep an eye on things. But if you have any questions, I want you to come directly to me. Okay. I work very closely with my employees. You're the lifeblood of my operation. We are a family. Sounds great. Right, you ready to go to work? Oh, now? Well, that's what we're here to do, isn't it? Oh, well, yeah, let's do it. Let's cook. - 16 feet. - Really. I mean, the poor lady, she... poor lady, she almost vomited all over the table. I guess some cropped up knees is better than having - a dead grandma in your. - Oh, exactly. Well, I'm just lucky it didn't make the news. No, no, no, I got... - got a better one for you. - Gon on, tell me. So, I walk in, okay, this is my Persian friend? I walk in, he's just butt naked, - just sitting there. - No. And I'm just like, what is going on? Come on. Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana! Mijo! What? What do you mean, 'What?' Come on! Out with it. So, tell us, Chef. Tell us about the restaurant. It's beautiful. Really beautiful. It's in the mountains and has an incredible view. How much they're paying you? Stop it, Daniel. And your boss? How's he? His name is Faust. He's a great guy. Amazing and very generous. He already has 10 restaurants and wants to open even more. Must pay you a lot, huh? And your work schedule? It's only open for dinner so I'll usually work late nights but today I have to go in early because they have a little initiation or my first night. Wow. Your father is going to be so proud of you. You should call him. I will. So can I come to the restaurant? Dude, dude, you can't afford it. Shut up, Lulu. Mom, what's the matter? Nothing, I'm just so proud of my grandson. I remember when you were little. All you ever wanted to do was help. I have been waiting for the right moment to give this to you and now you have earned it. This is for you. (Do you like it?) Yes! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Grandma. (I've got to head out, ok?) - Can you give me a ride? - Yeah. I don't want you driving through the mountains. It's fine, Mom. Come right back! I'm serious, Daniel! I need the car back in time for my meetings tonight! I heard you, Mom. Don't touch my radio. Put it back. Are you serious? Nah, man. I was just about to say, man, you're turning into dad. Settle down, everyone. Listen up. Settle down. As most of you might well be aware tonight, we are welcoming a new addition to our family. His name, well, his name is Chef. Sup, Chef? I'm a dishwasher. Are you... Seeing as this is his first night, we must give him a warm traditional welcome by throwing him into the fire. You all know the drill. Whatever he says tonight, goes. Are you nervous? Should I be? Chef, in all of the world, what is your absolute most favorite dish to eat? I don't know, um... Uh, a cheeseburger. Cheeseburger? - Come on, man! - Hey, hey, hang on. - Who threw that? - Get outta here. All right, everyone, Chef says a cheeseburger. Survey says? No. Come on, dude. We're not gonna make a cheeseburger?. You know where we are? All right. Second try. Grilled chicken curry, with mango chutney and basmati rice. - Mm, nah, nah, not quite. - Nah. - Almost. - Not there yet. All right, I've got it. We start with Wagyu Beef Tartare, and follow it with Muscovy duck, laded with a turnip puree in a light citrus jus. - Okay. - Nice. - Yes. - Wow. Survey says? - All right, Chef. - Yes. - Definitely. - Yeah, let's do this. - Yeah. - Let's do it. So much better. All right. Tonight's special, Beef Wagyu Tartare and Muscovy duck, it is. Let's get cooking. - Whoo! - Good. - Hey are you Mexican? - Yeah. Me too. I'm Rodrigo. Dishwasher, right? Nah, just that night. I'm a sushi chef in the day. Wow. World's first Mexican sushi chef. Nah,. I come from a whole family of them. Why don't you do it here? No, I'm not good enough for here. My cousin, Gary, is though. I've been trying to get him to work here forever. So, Chef, what's... what's your real name? What's the story there? Yeah, so, uh, my name was supposed to be Alejandro, but when... Get back to work. We'll chat later. We have to get back to work. - Right. - Have fun? Order up! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Yeah, we know! Chef? Can I speak to you for a minute? Yeah. So, what did you think of your first night? It was great. Why? The staff was incredible. Th... they were fast and creative. I just never seen anything like that. Do you feel like you belong here? I think so. How can you tell? Well, I don't really make friends that easy. But tonight, you did. Yeah. Rodrigo. Yeah. He's one of my favorites too. You know, when I first came to this country, I was all alone. Desperate. I opened my first restaurant, and experienced an ungodly amount of resistance. You will not believe the amount of people who tried to deny me, Chef, who betrayed me, one after another, investors, partners, customers. So, I decided to go out on my own, to trust no one, to rely on my own two hands, and my passion for food. And guess what? The rest is history. No, Chef. I was destroyed on my own. This world is not kind of individuals fighting alone to survive. Success depends on collaboration, interdependence, persistence. But there is a caveat. As I've said before, it's all about surrounding yourself with the right people. If a person has nothing to offer, just cut them loose. I cannot understand why people are so fearful to let go of toxic relationships, and find your family, the ones that matter, the Rodrigos. And burn the rest. Don't you worry about burning a bridge you might later want to cross? Never. Would you mind excusing me for a moment? Yeah, of course. Oh, and Chef, in case you were wondering, you do belong here. Breaking news out of Washington tonight is landmark legislation gains new momentum. A recent increase in raids have resulted in the overwhelming of ICE detention centers across the country. Riots have already begun in some neighborhoods with peaceful protests and others. What's going on? Shh, shh, shh. ...many as 60 deaths related to the riots. What are you guys doing? Hundreds of arrests and injuries have also been reported. At this time, exact numbers have yet to be verified as the riots continue. Just this afternoon, Congress voted to pass an immediate immigration policy to help deescalate the situation at the border. Although there are still many unanswered questions around the policy change, here's what we do know. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents have already begun the process of deporting five million illegal immigrants, which they plan to complete in the next six months. Government officials cite the rise in drug trade and violent deaths as primary reasons for the action. Although that some argue that reports are inaccurate and over-exaggerated. Along with the change, however, comes a new pathway to citizenship, which is being called the American Dream Fee by paying $20,000 per individuals, the payer is granted immediate citizenship. Congress hopes this will encourage lawful immigration of those who... Are we going to be ok? Of course. Mama. They could come here tonight. They won't come here. There aren't that many of us. There aren't many of us, but most are illegals. They came and took Mr. Lopez last night. What? Yeah, I'm not sure, but I think so. I could get a job. - Nah, Daniel, nah. - What? No. You need to go to school, man. Listen... I'll talk with my boss to see if I can pick up some extra shifts. Okay? You can't make enough to pay three fees. What choice do I have? My God. We need to pray. Thanks for meeting with me, Mr. Faust. Of course. Soon, we'll start scheduling chats and reserving our end table. Yeah. Um, this may not be the conversation you were expecting. It's kind of hard for me to bring up. - Are you quitting? - No. No. Actually, the opposite. I was wondering if I could pick up some extra shifts? Is everything okay? Does this have something to do with yesterday's... Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Chef. You don't need to be embarrassed. This is your family we're talking about. Instead of picking up extra shifts, how about I give you a raise? What? No. No, I... I can't accept that, Mr. Faust. I... I just barely started working here. I wanna pay my dues. - I need to pay my... - I'm serious. This isn't some kind of hollow offer I'm hoping you'll refuse. I need to make sure you're provided for. Your home life isn't a distraction to your work here. I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Faust. Don't worry about it. I'm sure you'll be able to return the favor soon. You know I would do anything. Really, Mr. Faust, thank you so much. You're welcome. All right. It's early, so gotta get washed up, and get started, yeah? What's going on? You know. My dad just texted me. He somehow got word, and my amigo as well and through our neighborhood the next couple days. How'd he hear that? I don't know. What are you gonna do? I don't know, man. I've just been thinking about it all day. It's just finally hittin' home. Could you run? No way. There's too many of us. I mean, like young kids, grandparents, we can't go nowhere. I'm sorry, man. It don't matter. It's just wrong though, you know? Like, my whole life is here. I talked to Faust today about pickin' up extra shifts. You sh... you should talk to him. I've been picking up those "extra shifts" for a few weeks now. You're gonna try to pay the fee? We'll see, if I can make enough in time. Yeah. Same here. When you talked to Faust about picking up extra shifts, what did... what did he say? He said yes. I... actually, I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but he just gave me a raise instead. He just like, increased your paycheck or something? Yeah, I guess. Hmm. Are you leaving? No. But my parents and Abuela are. That's why. What's why? Nothing. You know, before I started working here, I heard Faust was a racist. I... I... I don't know. But if he's helping my family, so like... It's just what I heard from my friend that got me the job. Don't matter though. If he ever crossed the line... What? Let's just say my family's not the type to go quietly. Good night, Chef. Good night. Good night, Chef. Good work, guys. Chef. Yeah? Can I have a word? Yeah. Take a seat. How much money do you need? What? - Exactly how much do you need? - Why? How many members of your family to pay the fee? Three. So, that's $60,000, right? Yeah. Okay. I can help you. - You already are. - It's... No, I mean really help you. How would you like to pay for one of your family member's fees by tomorrow morning? How? You have your driver's license, right? Yeah, but I don't have a car. It's okay. You don't need one. All you need to do is pick up a car from across town, drive it to a specific address, and leave it here. If you do this for me, I'll pay you $20,000. Are you joking? No, I'm being very serious. I mean, I can't pay you that every time. I mean, it sounds illegal. There's nothing illegal about driving a car. I mean, you have a driver's license, and you can consider yourself a valet. But what am I delivering? Just a car. What's in the car? Chef, I'm literally just asking you to pick up a car and drop it off in another place. Yeah, but it's... it's $20,000. That seems pretty easy just to... You consider it a signing bonus for doing me a favor. And in return, I'm trying to do you and your family a favor. I need the assurance that my best chef isn't going anywhere because his family has been broken up. Do you not believe me? I... I don't... Here's $10,000. Do this for me, and by tomorrow morning, you'll get the rest. I can't accept that, Mr. Faust. You have to provide, Chef. What? Provide. Provide for your family. Because tomorrow, you might wake up, and your parents and your grandmother are on their way back to Mexico. You're their protector, their provider. You're the family man, right? There's only one rule. Never open the trunk. Got it? On this piece of paper is an address. Don't put it into your phone. Don't search for it. Just give it to your driver. Here is fine. When you arrive at this location, there will be a silver car in the parking garage. Go to it. Behind the front left wheel of the car, you'll find a box. Inside the box is a key. Get into the car, and open the center console. There, you'll find another piece of paper with an address on it. Drive to the destination. You will need to arrive before 1:30 AM. Hey, man, you're in the right place. Sorry it's so late. I really appreciate you comin'. Yeah. Hey, thanks a lot. Hey, babe, let's go. Last night an estimated 600 illegal immigrants were rounded up in neighborhoods across the city. Reports show that by the end of the week the Immigration Enforcement Agency will begin an operation to deport another 2,000. It appears that law enforcement has focused their proves primarily on Mexican neighborhoods where large groups of illegal immigrants are known to be residing. Turn it off, Chef. I didn't turn it on. It's been on all morning. What is it? I have good news. You don't look like you have good news. What is it? I think we're going to be able to stay here. We weren't ever planning on leaving, were we? No, I mean... I mean we can stay forever. I can make enough money to pay the fee for all three of you. How? I got a raise. You've only been there two days, Chef. I know, but I talked to Mr. Faust about what was going on and he gave me a raise to help pay the fee. That's a big raise, Chef. And I don't appreciate you telling other people about our struggles. It doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. I'm just saying that we can stay. We don't have to worry anymore, because I'm going to provide for our family. I don't know what you're talking about. We're fine. Between your father and I we can make enough. We'll be fine. You know that isn't true, Mama. We need $60,000. $60,000, Mama. Nothings going to happen. This is real. This is real, ok? I have to earn enough. They could come and take you away tonight. You. Abuela. Dad. Daniel. Lucia. Why can't you understand that? I'm not going to let that happen. I have to run some errands before work. I love you, son. I love you too, mama. Who's missing? We haven't seen Rodrigo for a couple of days. That's right. This isn't a joke! But where is he today? Does anybody know? I talked to Rodrigo a couple nights ago and he told me that... he told me that his family might get deported. I don't know if he was, but he could've been. He was deported. I received a text message from him just yesterday, informing me that he can no longer work here. We are a family. I need you to know that. I know this might not apply to all of you, but if any of you are threatened or at risk by any of these recent changes, I need to know. I can help. We look out for each other. We support each other. And we will miss Rodrigo. Now, I'm sorry if this puts a damper on your mood for tonight. But the restaurant is fully booked. And you'll be busy. Hard work is a great distraction. Let's get to it, right? Come on. I'm sorry, Chef. ...it's two and two. Reverse work out of the first and third. Batting 245 this season. Now back to the Homeplate area. And there's breeze tonight. The outfielders responded accordingly. Two-two pitch, and it's inside. And Reaper has to jump back. Look out. One out, bottom of the seventh, a tie game. Lopez is on second. Taking in for Philippe. Here's the three-two. Help, help! Final , Reaper stays behind. Giants been rallying back here, went down two nothing in the second, three nothing in the fourth, the sixth was all good guys trying to add on here. Reaper's back in the box. Here's the pitch. And Reaper's get... Help! Hey! Please help! Please! Help! Help! Please, pull over! You don't have to do this. Let me go! Please! Help me! Please! Please! Hey, man, do you have a bathroom? It's out of order. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah? Do you know him? Oh, that's Bill. Is he all right? He's harmless. He just likes pace around a lot. Okay, great. Yo, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's $1.49. Sorry. It's one of those days. Sorry. Hey, do you want your change? We need to talk. Now. What happened? You know exactly what happened. I have no idea. What are you upset about? Did you drop the car off? Please don't do it. Chef, catch your breath. Tell me what happened. There was someone in the car. What you mean, in the backseat? No, in the trunk. In the trunk. I could hear them screaming and pounding. - Did you open it? - No! Chef, you have to believe me when I say I know nothing about this. Yeah, you keep saying that. But if you didn't know, then how come Michael was there? And don't try to tell me it was a coincidence because I saw his car the other night too. As I've told you before, Michael is here to make sure things get done properly. It's for your own safety. I'm done. Look at me. Look at me. You have to believe me when I say I did not know what happened. I'll get to the bottom of it. Here. I want you to take this. $10,000. Please. Save it for your family. You lied to me, Faust. You said this wasn't going to be illegal, and now, I'm moving dead... I'm moving living bodies. It seems to me that I'm the only one providing you with a means to keep your family together. And you are accepting the money. Let's not forget that. Listen, Chef, I truly am sorry. Let me make it up to you. I don't want you to make it up to me. I'm not interested. I'm going home. 50,000, Chef. 50,000. It's yours. And if I'm done my calculations correctly, that covers your family's fees. And leaves a healthy sum for you on the side. Same game. Same rules. And I'll give you the money. Just give it to me. You owe me that. I really would, Chef. But you know that I don't get paid until the car's delivered. Why is this one worth so much? What's in the car? Just a bag. I don't believe you. Do this for me, and you'll never have to see me again. One more time. And you and your family are free. I don't know. Go home. Sleep on it. Can I know what's in the bag? Meet me tomorrow. I'll give you all the information that you need. No secrets. I'll think about it. Okay. Last thing. For those of you who haven't met him, this is Gary. Gary's our new cook, a sushi chef, to be precise. He'll make a valuable contribution to our team. I want you to give him all a warm welcome. All right, let's get cooking. No. This is different. Timing is everything here. You'll have exactly 45 minutes from start to finish. One minute either side of that, I cannot guarantee your safety. Do you understand? Yes. Once you've dropped off the car, get out of there as quickly as possible. Don't come into work tomorrow. Lie low. Should I worry about cameras? Cameras? I don't know. Like street cameras? No, no, don't worry about that stuff. Should I wear a mask or... or something? Just wear what you usually wear. Okay? Okay. Listen, you'll be fine. Just remember the rule. Don't open the trunk. Right. Last question. What should I do if something goes wrong? 20 years ago, I opened up my first restaurant with a partner. He was much more experienced than I was, a real bulldog. We opened to much fanfare. Everybody loved our food. Except for one man. Unfortunately, for us, that man happened to be the most respected food critic in all the country. We couldn't understand why he hated our food. He pitted us against a local rival, and chose them as the winner. Well, my partner wouldn't have any of it. He held private tastings for the critic, shared recipes with the critic. Nothing changed his mind. Well, one day, my partner had enough. He paid a young chef from the other restaurant to put rotten meat into several of their dishes that night. Dozens of people got food poisoning. A couple so bad, they were hospitalized. One died. Following that, the restaurant closed. Guess what? The food critic finally gave us the glowing review we've been waiting for. I'm not sure I'm understanding, Faust. What does that have to do with my question? When something goes wrong, you do whatever it takes to make it right. You can never go too far. Hey, man, is that your car? Uh, yeah, why? New details tonight as police continue to search for the culprits of the bank robbery on West 23rd and 2nd Street this afternoon. By the time police responded, the suspects had already fled the scene. A breaking eyewitness account informed local enforcement that the getaway car was likely a white Toyota Camry. It is believed that the culprits may still be within city limits. Officers are encouraging citizens to report any additional information they might have. Chief Commissioner Ru... No, no, no, no! - I'm so sorry. - Get your hands up! - I'm so sorry. - Keep your hands up! - I don't know what's in there. - Put your hands up! - I don't know anything. - And keep them up! Hey, I don't know anything, okay? Get your hands up now! Put your hands up! - Okay, wait. - Get your hands up! - Ah, okay. - Stop moving. - Okay. - Listen to me. When I tell you, I want you to put your hands behind your head, interlace your fingers, - you understand? - Yeah. - Do you understand? - Yeah. Do it! Start doing it now! Okay. Do it! Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? - Why'd you do that? - Shut up! Why'd you kill him? - Why? - Get in the car. - Get in the car! - Okay, okay. Drive. Take this exit. The drop off was the opposite way. We're almost there. Where we going? Do you know what's in your trunk? Yes. Do you know how much of it's in there? No. Somewhere around three million. Get out. Get out! You, come here! You wouldn't. I would. Listen. All I want is the money. I can't let you take it. Now, back up. Back up! Don't be a hero. You don't even know who he really is. What are you talking about? Listen, you either shoot me or I'm taking the money. We both know you're not gonna shoot me. Don't move. Don't move! You think you're ever gonna be done driving, Chef? There's guys that have been doing this for years. There's only one way this ends. With Faust dead. Then why are you doing this, huh? What are you gonna do with the money? Faust never lets anyone out clean. This is my chance, and I'm taking it. You should too. You take the money, and then what? Tell me! Like I said, only one way out. I can't kill him. I'll turn myself in. Then what? He'll come after your family, and you won't be able to stop him. Then what do I do? Huh? I don't know. Shoot him. I can't shoot him. I've never even really held a gun before. You seem pretty comfortable with a knife. It's your family, man. We got a deal? ...now that we go back today, uh, dogs in. Faust! - We need to talk. - What's going on? We need to talk. Excuse me, everyone. This is one of my chefs. You're embarrassing yourself. Go to bathroom now. I'll see you in there. Go. Excuse me, everyone. There seems to be a minor incident in the kitchen. Rest assured, your meals will be fully comped tonight. I apologize for the interruption. What happened? It didn't work. What do you mean, it didn't work? Someone called the cops. I was being tailed. The money is gone. What? Faust, really, I... Do you know how many wetbacks I employ? Dozens. Each of them as desperate as you, begging me to save them, to save their families, humping my leg like dogs. So they do as I tell them. Or else I make one call, and they wake up in the hole that they crawled out from. But you're a little different. Do you know why? No. Because of a piece of paper with your name on it. You're an American. And if you were suddenly to go missing, people would care about that. But no one cares about your friends, like Rodrigo. Rodrigo failed me. He crossed a line. You deported him. Ah, no. I killed him. Actually, you killed him. What? You heard him in the trunk of your car and did nothing about it like a coward. I thought for a moment that you knew everything. No. But you're too stupid to know anything. From the moment you first set foot in that car, I own you. It was a nice car, wasn't it? Wasn't it?! It was also a stolen car. And now I have it. It has your fingerprints all over it. You're mine. I could bury you. So, you will work for me. Or you'll go to jail and your family will go back to Mexico, if they are lucky. You cost me a lot of money tonight. But you'll repay me. Oh, yes, you'll make it up to me. You will drive for me every night until you've repaid the debt. Got it? Yeah. Got it? Good. Now, where's the car? I was... I was trying to tell you that Michael ran off with it. He shot a cop. He's probably half way to Mexico now. I'll take care of him. I need you here tomorrow at 7:30 AM, got it? Now, get up! Oh, and Chef... This should cover the rest of the fee. Because we're family, right? Hey, you're Chef, right? Uh, yeah. Um, Gary? Yeah, hey. Heard a lot about you. I just wanted to let you know if there's anything I can do, I'm here to help. Yeah, uh, I heard you have some talent with fish. I guess so. Yeah, we have a few fish items. So, hopefully, we could put you to use tonight. Cool, yeah. Hey, um, that's actually not the real reason why I wanted to speak to you. I was wondering, who's in charge of orders around here? I am. Um, Carlos processes it though. Why? Oh, well, I have to do a custom sushi order for Faust and his guest tomorrow night. And, uh, I just had a couple requests. Sure. Yeah. All right. Um, I need albacore, puffer fish, and eel, please. - Puffer fish? - Yeah. And, uh, everything else we have in stock. So we should be okay. Are you licensed to serve it? I heard it's extremely poisonous. Yeah, yeah, if... if you serve the wrong part, it is. But, uh, I am licensed. And I'm gonna go ahead and prepare it myself. - So, we'll be okay. - Okay. Yeah, um, I'll put in an order for all that. Thanks, Chef. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, what's up with the name, man? Um, uh... So, when I was born, my mom said she's... Hey, Chef. Faust wants to see you in the restaurant. Now? I guess. - I'll see you later. - Yeah. We're closed for Sunday?. What's up, Chef? Surprise. Chef. What are you guys doing here? Don't worry. Please, come and join us for a moment. I'm sorry. I interrupted your story. That's right. Abuela, here, is so proud of Chef. She mounted his name in our kitchen. Really? Well, you've taught him well, senora. He's doing a fine job in this kitchen. I owe so much to him. In fact, I'm rather indebted to your family. I have an idea. How would you like it if Daniel came and worked a few nights with me? - Yeah. - No. I just don't think that's a good idea, Willem. Daniel has school. Mama, I don't think it's a good idea. It's hard work and sometimes we have to work really late nights. Oh, come on, Chef. It's a great idea. It'd be so much fun. You and Daniel both working in the same kitchen together. Plus, it would only be a few nights of the week. I promise to pay him handsomely. Come on, Mama. You're always telling me I need to work harder. I guess we could make it work. You two could ride to work together. I just... I just don't think it's a good idea. Yeah, sounds great. Wonderful. Um, I just wanted to let you know that my kids will always be indebted to you. Oh, I know they are. Daniel, why don't you come and see me early next week? I have a job waiting for you. Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great. Well, that settles it then. Chef, it's time that you prepare the food for your family. Show them your hand at work. Of course. Please, tell me, your husband can... Quiet down, love. I'm trying to watch TV. Sorry, Abuela. I'm going to head to work, ok? Ok, grandson. I love you, Abuela. I love you too. Lulu, you here? Lulu? Lulu? I love you, Abuela. Love you too. Tell everyone else I love them too. I will. Be safe, ok? 'Kay. All right, everybody, gather up. I'd like to introduce a new member of the family tonight. Her name is Gloria. Chef over here is the master of the house. So direct any questions you have to him. Don't you want to ask him how he got his name? All right, everybody, have a good night. Faust. Yes, Chef? I just wanted to talk to you in private after we close up tonight. Okay. - Is everything all right? - Yeah. I just wanted to thank you, uh, after last night for giving my brother a job 'cause I was a little nervous at the beginning. But I think it would be good for him. Okay. And he had so many questions he wanted to ask you, so I promised him I would. Absolutely. Anything for your family. Thank you, Willem. I'll come and get you after work. Don't worry. I'll come find you. Sure. So, when you dine at my table, you get the king's treatment. Tonight, we have an array of fine food from my new chef, Chef Gary. He's our sushi master. And, uh, he's prepared us a five-course sushi platter. Are you on Faust's table tonight? Yeah, 10 quarters of the sushi. Each person with their own special arrangement. This, his food. Puffer fish? Sounds great. Keep going. Hey, Chef. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. You remember Rodrigo? Of course. Now, I'm just curious. What happened to him? He got depo... Wait. Would you do anything for your family? Order up! This is going to Faust. You're his cousin. So would I. SERVER; Bon apetit. This is the food that I was telling you about. Sushi chef, yeah. Ooh. I mean, I've heard that chefs make or break a restaurant. Mmm, yes, you're absolutely right. I found the key to run a successful restaurant is not giving into a man's desires, but more of satisfying his instincts and needs. 'Cause if you do this, you'll have him coming back for years to come. Mmm. Excuse me. It's probably pretty hard to find... Yeah, so, at above all else, the most important... Component is your employees. So, it's Chef, right? What's the story of your name?
