THREE DAYS AND ONE LIFE Based on the novel BY PIERRE LEMAITRE Belgium Ardennes December 25, 1999 Thank you all for being here. Now in the investigation, nothing indicates a kidnapping. We'll inspect the forest from North. Tomorrow, if needed, Civil Protection Services will join us with police squads of the region. Let's make sure the child isn't lost. If it's the case, if he's hurt, hypothermia is a risk. Be extremely alert as you move forward. It's imperative each square meter we cover be permanently eliminated from the search. If you find him, if he's unconscious or hurt, above all, do not touch him, immediately call your lead person. Let me remind you, children are not allowed on this hunt. THREE DAYS EARLIER DECEMBER 22,1999 Hi Mom! Hey big boy! Already up? You can sleep in, it's the holidays. I'm not tired. What are you doing today? I don't know. You could, I don't know... C'mon! He's always in a hurry. He should pay his staff. Can't you get another job? You know, jobs aren't so easy to find. I should go. - See you tonight. - Yes. By the way, your lunch money. - Have a nice day! - Stop it! Hi! - What's that? - Curtains for Mrs. Antonetti. There you are! I wouldn't touch him, he's really dirty. I know what you want! C'mon, go get it! Boy does this dog smell! He leaves for days who knows where. He's gotta have a girlfriend. For sure! Wait up! Emily has a delivery, can you drop Remy off please? Dad forgot his lunch. Did you see Theo's scooter? Isn't it a beauty? Meh... Reproduction does more than ensuring the continuity of the species. It creates... the... the diversion... of both sexes. THE HUMAN BODY Antoine, what's this? I'll explain later. Well... - See you! - What are you doing later? I'm going grocery shopping with my mom. Bye! Hi Mrs. Antonetti! Hello dear. You know, one day, men will walk on Mars. No way. You're always joking around. Goodbye Mrs. Guenot. - Take care. - Goodbye, doctor. Hello kids! Already? That was fast. Stay here. It's old but it's pretty good. Thank you. It's for the Christmas tree. It's not much... But don't open it before, okay? I promise. Go on. Who's next? C'mon! Go get it! Selling the factory is crap! You think I'm doing it for fun? I didn't say that, Mr. Weiser! We lose money every month, banks won't lend us no more. If we wait for bankruptcy, nobody will buy it. They want us to believe that to sell our machinery! And make the toys in China! That's what will happen! They could have just bought the machines. You agree 'cause you assist the mayor? - Get out of here! - Leave the kid! Mind your own business! Don't fuck with me! You don't care! You're selling and running! You're lucky your dad is dead. Don't say that, he'll calm down. Wanna go to St. Eustache later on? Yes. Don't forget, it's a secret. Don't tell your sister or anyone else. Ulysses, get the ball! Yeah I kissed her with my tongue! - No way! - I swear! - Your tongue? - All the way in! - Hi Theo! - We're rehearsing later, you coming? I'm busy. I have plans. See you. I'm meeting up with her later. Nice dog. Stay here, I'll be back. Hello, Antoine. Hi Valentine. War! Nine. Three. Queen. Ace. When will you show the cabin to Emily? Tomorrow morning. Can I come? I'd rather be alone with her. Why? Come on, let's go. Ulysses! Come on, Ulysses! Go get it! C'mon, Ulysses, go get it. And I jump back down. - Remy! - Mom! Come on dear! Hello Sir. I couldn't hear you, I had no service. Hi Antoine. Hello Antoine! Stop! Stop! He jumped out of nowhere! I'm so sorry, Michel. Ulysses... Poor thing. He's still breathing. Frederic. Antoine? Are you up or downstairs? You didn't set the table? I can't do it all. Do you hear me? Are you ok? What's wrong? You're all pale. Are you sick? No, I'm fine. Nothing's wrong. You caught cold. No, I didn't. Let me get you something. DECEMBER 23, 1999 Good morning. Here's your aspirin. Could you pick up the poultry, please? I'm late... Cover yourself. And tell him I'll be right there! - What's up? - The poultry please. So? Santa Claus is coming soon? I'm 12 years old. What did you ask for? A Nintendo 64. But it's too expensive for my mom. Times are tough for everyone. Here... Thank you. Antoine? Antoine! What are you doing? Why are you breaking the cabin? Why did your Dad do that? What did he do? Go away! Leave me alone! Remy? Remy... - Did you find him? - No, nobody's seen him. He knows he can't go out alone. Where can that kid be? I hope no one took him. Mrs. Guenot! So? - Nothing. - Did you see Antoine? I just saw him go home. Antoine! I'll keep on looking. Antoine? Have you seen Remy? Was he with you? Where could he be? Did you see him this morning? Yeah, over there, in the garden. Wasn't he with you? Did you call Michel? They're on strike, no one's answering. Will you run over there and get Michel? Okay. Thank you. Remy Desmedt... 6 years old. He wasn't by the river. Why would he go there? - We're looking... - Yeah right! He's nowhere. What about this morning? - He went to the corner. - And then? Then he walked back home. - Unless, he went out again. - Alone? Why chatting instead of searching? Exactly, help us find him, answering our questions. Questions? Come with me. What for? 3 years after the Dutroux case, the Ardennes village of Olloy is shook up by a missing child, Remy Desmedt, a six and half-year-old boy. The police sent out the alert for a fair-haired child, with light eyes, around 4 feet tall, wearing a blue jacket, a grey sweater, and black rubber boots. All theories are being considered. Civil Protection Services will be searching near the river of Olloy. What a tragedy. Poor little pumpkin. Don't worry, we'll find Remy, right? It's just like Martine's son. He disappeared when he was three. Where did they find him? Asleep in the laundry basket! Don't worry, we'll find him. DECEMBER 24, 1999 Antoine, you're up when the whistle blows! I walked past the house. And I left that way. Very well. Please, come with me now. Antoine, you left home and you saw Remy. What time was it? I don't know. Where was he? In front of the house. He didn't leave? He just stayed there? Did you see a car or anyone? Who? Someone you don't know. No. There was nothing unusual? No. It doesn't match up. What's different? They say the opposite of what he says. Which means? Not the same time of day. Get me the van. You really can't recall the time? Are you sure? Think, Antoine! It's very important. No. What was Remy doing there? Looking where the dog died. A dog died? What do you mean? He was crying, his dad killed his dog. One shot. You killed your dog yesterday? He got hit by a car! He was hurt. He was done. You shot a rifle in town? Why aren't you looking for my son? Instead of talking about the dog! When you left around 9:15 am, Remy was in the garden, right? And then? I went to the factory, and he walked me to the corner as usual. He went back to the house. I saw him. I want you to show me. There's nothing to show, God damn it! Listen, I understand. This isn't easy... But it doesn't add up. What doesn't add up? You left Remy at the corner at 9:15. The factory's 15 minutes away, right? So what? You got there after ten. It's confirmed. Mr. Desmedt, let me ask you... What did you do between 9:15 and 10 am? I don't know. I stopped for coffee. No offence, we imagined that, but we checked, and no one saw you. Let's talk about this calmly, okay? We just need to talk. Your wife needs rest. Let's go. What about Desmedt? He hid out in the lot to dump sugar in Mouchette's gas tank. What an idiot. You think he got kidnapped? Doesn't matter what I think. Everyone thinks so. Let's find him before hell breaks out. We're working on it! Let's go! The police came to the store. They arrested Mr. Kowalski! 24 hours after the disappearance of Remy Desmedt in Olloy, a search is focused on the Viroin River, near the child's home. Investigators are following all leads, and are not excluding a sexual predator. This morning the police arrested a retailer from nearby Marmont. After questioning the father's child, the new suspect... C'mon, that's enough. Let's eat or we'll be late. Here... I think I overcooked it. It's overcooked. I know it's not him. I always thought he was strange. Me too. I never bought his meat. Never! Did he say where he hid the boy? You kidding? He won't talk. The news said they searched his home and found nothing. He didn't bury him in the cellar. See you later, I have to go. Good night, Blanche. Good night. You saw him get arrested? Yes, but I don't see what for. His van was parked by the forest when the boy disappeared. That's not proof. I mean, I'm not defending him... But if we can't park somewhere without being accused of... kidnapping a child... That's not the issue! He won't say why he was there. If he's innocent, why won't he answer? Let's go. It sure is a dark story. Fucking strangers! Let's try to find your father. How are you? Do you have a light? Thank you. So, you made the arrest? That's my job. Welcome, brothers and sisters, on this Christmas Eve, to celebrate the birth of Jesus. The one who calls us, bringing us Joy, Peace and Hope. God, Our Father, in the heart of this night of Light, we are gathered around the crib, to welcome into our lives this magnificent event. You are a humble and fragile God. For this love, we want to praise you through Jesus, your beloved son, who rules with you and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and ever. Amen. On this Holy night, let our prayers be heard. May the light of hope live inside us. Particularly during this hardship befallen our community today. What about my son? He's worth nothing? Seriously... My son's been missing for 2 days. You'd rather sing than look for him? That's what you suggest? Let's sing Christmas carols? He's missing! I've looked everywhere! Fucking hell! My little boy Remy is missing! And we're doing nothing! The police say he might be lost. But they won't start the hunt for another 2 days. I was told it's hard to organize. Can you believe that! We need to go today! What will happen to Remy if we don't do something? May I have your attention, please. In order to find our dear Remy, a search will start in the morning. The police invite all volunteers to participate. We'll meet tomorrow morning at nine in front of Town Hall. Thank you. Let's go, Antoine. We will find him. Good night Mom. What about your gifts? Oh yeah, right. Sorry. Here... Thank you, Mom. You shouldn't have... With your grades, you deserve it. Same as your watch last year. Don't you wear it anymore? Sure, it's upstairs. This is yours. For me? What is it? It's nice, where did you find it? At Memories in Marmont. Thank you, my love. What is that? A gift from the doctor. "To the future Dr. Courtin. "My best, Hubert..." That's kind. I hope you thanked him! Yes? I'll be right there! It was Emily, Jeanne is not well. The doctor's unreachable. Go find him! Come on! Hurry! Can you come quickly? Mrs. Desmedt is not well! I'll be right down. DECEMBER 25, 1999 Now in the investigation nothing indicates a kidnapping. We'll section the forest from North. Tomorrow, if needed, Civil Protection Services will join us with police squads of the region. Any information can help. Report findings to your lead person. A policeman or firefighter will take over. Let me remind you, children are not allowed to participate in this hunt. Remy! Remy! Remy! This way! I found something! So? No. Remy! We'll stop here for today. Why? It's late. We'll start from here in the morning. Let's meet tomorrow at 9 am. Thank you all. But we can keep on! Mr. Desmedt, night is falling. There will be a helicopter and dogs tomorrow. Come on. Antoine! Did you see Desmedt kill the dog? Anyway, he was an ugly ass dog. Shut up! Hey young man! Antoine! What's going on? What's wrong with you? What's got into you? Are you okay? Can't you behave yourself! Go inside! I'll be a while. We stopped at St. Eustache. We haven't found him yet. Tomorrow there'll be dogs. Thanks for coming. - How is he? - He's okay. Did he throw up? No. He's feeling better. So, big boy? What happened? We're all feeling the same. Everyone's suffering. Now is not the time, but we need to talk. I'll come back tomorrow. And we'll sit down and talk, just you and me. Meanwhile, no more... reckless actions. Agreed? Don't worry, like I said, it isn't dangerous. He's going to have a stomachache. - I'll go see! - Wait! Antoine! Antoine, stay here! Come here. Come. Mom? Mom! Mom! Northern France and Belgium were hit last night by a sudden and exceptionally violent storm. The locals are in shock. More than one hundred deaths have been reported and many others injured. What we already call the storm of the century has been considerably underestimated by the weather services. There is considerable damage estimated at billions. In some areas, many roofs were torn off, knocked down electric towers, cars carried away and flooded homes. A large part of the country still has no power. Mostly the east has been touched. Some towns such as St. Croix and Marmont are cut off from the world. This is also the case for Olloy. Entire forests were destroyed. The fallen trees have hindered the search for Remy Desmedt, missing since the morning of December 23rd. Forest restoration will be long, difficult and costly. The region's economy is threatened. Private lands, such as the forest of St Eustache, will remain as is. Restoration will not begin for many years to come. 15 YEARS LATER Yes. How are you? Good. How was last night? Alright, super! You did well not to come. Laura, do you mind if I call you back? I'm almost there. Yeah, me too, babe. See you later. - Hi Mom! - How are you? For you. Thank you. - I was worried. - Don't be. I'll just unload first. - You must be tired. - Not really. There's nothing left there? Nothing. Where will you sleep? At a friend's. It's only for two months. - Can I help? - Here, take this. Take the bag. Thanks. - I'll put it in my room? - Yes. Hi Theo! - Hi dude! - You okay? I'm alright. You must be exhausted. I'm good, you know, 2 suitcases and 6 boxes, I'll get over it. You don't look so good. Well... I know, I say that every time. - I'll stop when I'm dead. - I know, Mom. - No snacking! - I'm hungry. Go get dressed, we're late. I've been on the road, I'm really hungry. Come on! Go get dressed! Hurry up! You too? Who will be there? Everyone! Go get ready! We won't be long? Of course. Look who's here! Hi! - How are you? - Fine and you? - You're back? - For 2 or 3 days. Hi Antoine! - You still look good. - Thanks. - Congratulations! - Thanks! - How many months? - 7. What is it? A girl? A boy? It's a boy! We're a boy town gang! - And you, Antoine? A baby? - Not now. No. - You have a girlfriend at least! - Nothing serious. Shall we start now? Not everyone's here! Well, everyone... It's not a big deal. Is the doctor here? Not yet! Go on Antoine. Yes, I'll go. Excuse me. You okay? - It's just a cut. - Let's have a look, anyway. It's not a deep cut, the tendon isn't hurt. Let's clean it up. It'll be fine. - Thanks, Doctor. - It's alright. Thank you all for being here. The past year has had its share of surprises and disappointments, starting with... the failure in negotiating the reopening of the factory. But I still have hope in finding a new buyer this year. A beer, please! Hi Antoine! Missing the boredom of Olloy? - What are you drinking? - Nothing. You sure? No, Sir, I don't drink alcohol. - Really? - Never. It was a bad adventure last time... but a job is a job. And I know, for example, Vincent and Mrs. Ducret, how much this job counts for you. On the good side, thanks to all your support, we were able to keep the negotiations with the administration on... Did you see Antoine? And the Grade School stays open! For how long... It's time for the kids to open their gifts. Thank you, Blanche, our administrative auxiliary, for your devotion and efficiency. Thank you, Blanche! And to finish I'd like to thank the Dr. Dieulafoy, who will take a well-deserved retirement in March. Thank you. We will miss him. He leaves us without a successor. We also have a gift for you. We hope this will be useful over there in the South! Thank you. Let's do this. A toast to friendship! Merry Christmas! That will be on the autopsy. So, you're a coroner... Not at all! I always want to quit and then... It's been what? 5, 7, 8 years? Pretty much, I think. Where do you live now? Chamonix? No. Chambery? Chambery. I used to be. You didn't like it? No, it's not that. My souvenir shop didn't work out. Where else could I go? Back home. Just for the holidays. My fiancé's transferred, we're moving soon to Paris. - Paris is nice! - I don't know. If I have to live in a suburb, I'd rather stay here. Yes. - What about you? - What? - You're a doctor now? - Yes, I'm certified. Just one more diploma. So, it's true, you're going to Egypt? To the Middle East I hope. We'll see. Affectation is in February. You wouldn't live here? The town doctor is not my thing. You mean you didn't choose Olloy. Absolutely. I can't stay here. - You know, Theo is the DJ? - No. - Ever heard him? - How is it? It's not good. It's actually bad. I'm not surprised, poor Theo, such a jerk. Really?! "Poor Theo"? You dated him, remember! Don't be jealous, we were 12. I was jealous and in love. Who says I wasn't too? Let's go before they come for us. Did you see Antoine? Yes, it's been a while. I'm glad. - It's been 8 years. - That's what we were saying. You must be happy to retire? Closing down the practice breaks my heart. Even the police station will close one day. I think you're selling too high! If you could, would you buy the doctor's practice? Are you kidding! Nobody would want it even for free. Though I get it. A life on the road between 7 am and 11 pm. Who would want that these days? Honestly, would you? Honestly, no. You are right. The young need to travel. That's good. The Mayor does what he can. Nobody's interested, really. I know the doctor, he'd sell for a decent price. Please, we talked about it 100 times! No means no, okay? I wouldn't set foot in Olloy if you weren't here. Take this. What? Nothing. - There! Wait! - I felt it! I think he's asleep. Hello! Nice! Hi! - You good? - Yeah. - You're on duty? - Yes. So? You're still working? Well, yes. Not for long, I hope. Emily's gonna take over. Really? I'm thinking about it. - I'll tell you next week? - Okay. - On your mom's tab? - Yes. - Going home? - Yes. - Bye! - Have a nice day! Were you spoiled for Christmas? I'll show you, but no comments. That's pretty nice! I said no comments. What about you? Christmas is not a thing in our family. Yes, of course, sorry. It's all right. It's more my parents, I'm good. Good then. - How did you get it? - I stole it. - From me? - Yes. Without the prosaic details, this picture... - It served me well. - I don't want to know. It's true. It's how it is. You know I have it here? Oh yeah? You want to see it? Yes. Let's go. Here! You had low standards. If you don't like it, I'll keep it. Look, seriously? I really like it! You think it's... No wait! Sorry, I... I don't really know. What about you? I don't know either! And this bed is really small. Anyways, it's not forever. We should get over this once and for all, right? Yeah, you're right. Let's put it all behind us. Well, the bag... because it's... Antoine? Are you there? I'll be down in a minute! What should we do? I'll go downstairs. I'll keep her busy, then go out the back door, okay? Okay. - Mom... - Yes? - Listen... - Yes. Mr. Mouchotte wants to see you tomorrow. Sure, no problem, I'll go. Can I show you something? - Wait a minute. - Yeah, sure. - All is good? - Yes. You know, about my boxes, they're all over the place. Could I put them downstairs? Oh yeah? If you want... Let me show you. If you don't mind, I'll put them there. Do as you wish, I don't mind. Great! Just put them all the way in the back, so I can access my stuff. - How many are there? - 6 boxes. I'll stack them up. They're not too big. Fine. - Is that okay? - 6 boxes should be fine. What I'm going to do is take all this off... TWO MONTHS LATER Sir, we've arrived. Excuse me. Antoine! - Goodbye Murielle. - Bye Doctor. My regards to your husband! Hi Doctor, how are you? So, it's the farewell tour? Yes, something like that. How much longer? About 3 or 4 days. - Where to? - To Cairo. I'm thrilled, it's really what I wanted. Very good. It's all thanks to you. Say hello to your mother. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. So? - You haven't left yet? - No. - You ok? - Yes. - And you? - I'm fine. Your mom said you'd come. Well, yeah. Can we meet tonight? No, I'll be with mom. - Sure? - She wouldn't understand. I need your advice. I'll call you. The doctor gives Jeanne 4 Anexsia pills a day. Is that right? I can't say, but the doctor knows what he's doing. She's not doing so well. She sleeps all day. I can check on her if you want. What are the logs for? - It's from St. Eustache. - How's that? It's for the sawmill company, but it's just old rotten wood. They do what they want! Hi, it's Emily. I couldn't talk earlier. You have a minute? No, I... I have to clean up the apartment. - It's urgent? - You don't know my mom. When can we meet? I really need to see you. This week, okay? What does that mean? Listen, I can't right now. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay? You swear? I swear, yes. I promise, spit shake on it! - Ok. Bye. - See you. We'll talk tomorrow. Missing child, Remy The investigation is stalling I WANT NOBODY TO FORGET HIM "Thinking of you. Can't wait to get home. Love." - How are you? - Hi Mom! Come here. So, that's it. It's the last time. I'm only leaving for 2 years. Sure, 2 years is nothing for you. I'll miss you. You too. Come on! Yes! What's wrong, Mom? They found Remy's body. All right... With the family's agreement and in order to prevent rumors and avoid any tensions, I've asked the prosecutor to come and inform us about the progress of the investigation. - Mr. the Prosecutor. - Thank you. The autopsy revealed that Remy was killed with one hit on the right temple by a blunt instrument: a stone, a stick. He was not abused. The child's body was transported to the place where his remains were found. A hair that doesn't belong to him was found on his clothes. The DNA analysis reveals that the hair belongs to a male individual, Caucasian type, with bright eyes, but which is not on any police file. Mr. Kowalski, formerly heard as a witness in the case, volunteered to have his DNA collected. After matching with the one found on Remy's body, any suspicion about him is ruled out. What does that mean exactly? It means the hair doesn't belong to Mr. Kowalski. He's off the hook. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. Just like you, Mr. Desmedt. What do we do now? We have the DNA of the man who's probably Remy's killer. This genetic code will remain in our files with no time limit. If tomorrow, in one month, in ten years his DNA is taken for whatever reason, he will immediately be identified and arrested. Even if it was an accident, someone here did it! That's a possibility. So! Why can't everyone here get the DNA test? Mr. Desmedt, the killer might be a resident of any nearby town. We'd have to analyze a lot of people and it would be a blind search. The killer could be a wanderer. It would be a pointless step and an expense we can't afford. Thank you for your attention. Doctor! Hello. - You okay? - Yeah. Can we talk now? Of course, yes. It's not possible. It's not mine. Yes, it is. 8 weeks, it has to be you. No birth control? No. Jerome and I were trying, so... You didn't put anything either. No, yes, of course. Well, 8 weeks... - 8 weeks. - Yes. That's not what I meant. It's just... We have until 14 weeks, so... Don't worry, okay? I'll take care of it. I don't want to abort. I want to keep the baby. Wait... What do you want us to do? I left Jerome, it's not his baby. Since it's yours, the best is to... We should get married. No! - I don't love you. - Neither do I. There you go! I'm pregnant so what do we do? We're not getting married! It's absurd. I'm leaving in 2 weeks! Why did you do it then? We had sex! That's different. It's not different now! You will claim the child. Even if I make you! I don't see how. - I'll file a complaint. - Do so. Doesn't matter. I'll ask for a DNA test to prove it's yours. I'll refuse. I think justice can make you do it. If you don't claim this child, I'm gonna stay here with a bastard. Your mom will be ashamed forever. Is that what you want? Yes? - You're up early too? - Yes. We were all... shocked yesterday... Hearing the prosecutor say the investigation's over. We'll leave it to luck. I think a lot about Jeanne. And about Michel. Their little boy got killed. They may never know what happened. It's cruel, don't you think? Yes. Fifteen years ago I found myself here, precisely... You emptied the medicine cabinet. I pretended not to understand that day. I wanted to reassure you. I wanted us to talk, decide together what to do. Then the storm swept everything away. We abandoned the search. Our main problem was to... survive. What could we do? I've always loved you, you know that. It didn't help. This child's disappearance obsessed me. I never stopped thinking about it. I was wondering what to do. And now there's the DNA. It seems like the truth is here, nearby... All we have to do is reach out. I don't know what you have to say and I don't want to know. But I think it's time to tell me. I'd rather hear it from you. Just in case, I wrote a letter for the prosecutor. He'll get it tomorrow. I'm not judging you. So don't judge me either. In this story, everyone copes in their own way. So, ZEN, which makes 36. Plus 7. Plus 7. I win! Like always! Another one? No, I'm tired. I'm going to bed. You sure? Goodnight. Goodnight, Mom. What's going on? Have you sent the letter? If you haven't yet, I want to buy your practice. THREE YEARS LATER It's not possible. I'm full today. I have another call, I'll call you back. Damn it! Again? I'm here! I'll be right there! Damn it! Hi, doctor. I'm sorry. Come on Michel, let's go! Let's go! Please! Come on! It's going to be okay. Let's go! Let's go! There. Come on! We're almost there! There you go. There you go. There's mashed potatoes in the fridge. Let's go and get change! Who's gonna stay with grandma? Yes? - I'll be right there. - Yeah. How are you Diego? Hello. So, who's next? - It's my turn. - Come with me. Tell me. What brings you here? A bad cough... Let's have a look. It's just a virus. There's no medication. We don't see you here often? I'm Polish. I have a rock-solid health. Your birth date is December 26, 1957, right? In Gdynia? Yes. My mom used to receive postcards. Unsigned postcards from Gdynia. Was that you? Yes. That was me. It's none of my business after all. With the reputation she gave me, intimate postcard from me must have seemed weird. Your mom and I loved each other. You know your mom's need for respect. I didn't want to compromise her. I respected her. I understand. Why tell me now? You asked, I answered. You and I... We have our little secret. Well, it's not much but... That day I drove along the forest. I saw you coming from St. Eustache, crossing the road, hiding yourself. I was intrigued. I parked. I looked for you for a long time. That's when they saw my truck. Why didn't you say anything? For your mother. Our story didn't survive the drama. It's the past now. I'm retiring soon. I'm leaving Olloy. And please, doctor, don't worry. Hello Mr. Kowalski. - How much do I owe you? - 25 euros. Great! Thank you. Hello, how can I help you? Thank you. - Good evening. - Hi. - Merry Christmas! - To you too. You're just in time. You okay, Antoine? Yeah, I'm fine. Merry Christmas. To you too. It's perfect. It sure looks like it. - Can I serve you, Blanche? - I'd like that. Thank you. Dad? Serve your mother. Antoine? Your plate? Yes. Sorry. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you. - Enjoy your meal! - Thanks. Was it a busy day? Yes. It's winter. Everyone's sick. Thanks. THREE DAYS AND ONE LIFE Subtitles: Register ©
