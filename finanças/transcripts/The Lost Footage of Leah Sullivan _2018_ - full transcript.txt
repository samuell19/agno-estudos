I'll do it anyway. Alright. Yeah, well- Might as well. -Ok. I'll meet you right over there. Ok. Sounds good. Bye. Alright. Oh shit. (Mouth sounds.) Based on the research I've done, only a handful of people have studied the Mulcahy Murders. And their information is- unreliable. It's one of those haunting tales that- (Bang.) It's one of those haunting tales that should be legend- (Bang.) It's one of those haunting tales that should- (Bang.) (Door open.) (Door open.) Oh my gosh! You scared me! Oh, I'm sorry. I knew I heard somebody out there. Oh, well you did. You heard me. Oh, you're making your movie. I'm sorry. It's ok. It's ok. (Laughter.) (♪Christmas music.) Is this ok? Yeah. Just sit still. I think I should finish my coffee first. Do you mind? I feel like I've got bags under my eyes. You look beautiful. I'm tired. You've been up for like five hours. Exactly. Don't worry about it. Aren't you showing this to your class? Yeah, but you look fine. (Sigh.) I don't want to scare anybody. You're crazy. Boo! (Laughter.) Ok. Stillness. (♪Christmas music.) (Laughter.) Alright. So, I'm just going to start with a couple questions. Sound good? Ok. Do I look at the camera, or at you? Ooo, that's a good question. Um... You're my first interview. I don't really know. What do you think? I don't know these things. Ok. Um.... Look at me. Let's make it real casual. Like a 20-20 interview, or something. -Ok. -Ok. Um... (Clears throat.) Actually, I'm going to- Oh, can I have another sip too? Oh, yeah yeah. And you can take sips throughout as well of your coffee if you want. Whenever you feel like it. You don't have to force it. Ok. (Clears throat.) So- (Laughter.) Alright. Serious. Can you say your name? Oh, and I thought these were going to be easy questions. I'm Alice Sullivan. And, when did you move to Lutton, Massachusetts. In, uh- Let's see. I moved here in 1972. I didn't always live in this house. I moved into this house in 1976. When Charlie and I had your cousin Emma. Oh. Do you think it would be better if we didn't know each other? Like if we pretend we're not related? Actually, no. I think the more personal the better. We can include all that stuff. So that was ok then? Yeah. You're killing it. Oh, that's what I do. I kill it. (Laughter.) Alright. Did you know the Mulcahy's? No. I thought that you said that you did. Well, I knew of them. I didn't know them personally. Ok. What did you know of them? Um... Joseph Mulcahy moved here from South Boston. He and his wife, and his two kids. He was a little crazy. Kept to himself. Didn't have a job. Just worked out of that house. All day long. Everybody thought that maybe he worked for the government, or something. Can you say all of the names of the Mulcahy's? I thought you know this. Well, I do. But I don't want to just hear my voice saying all this stuff. But me though? Yeah. You have a great voice. I'll get some one else to do it too, probably. Oh, alright. Um... There was Joseph Mulcahy. He was the dad. He was in his mid-thirties. Um... There was Rebecca. Mulcahy, obviously. She was the mom. They were about the same age. And the two kids. Uh... I don't remember. Jessica! That's it. And Edward. Jessica was the older one. And- I think she was a year older than Emma. And Emma is my cousin, your daughter. Yes. Oh, sorry. Am I supposed to say stuff like that? I think so. Yeah, yeah. I think the more personal the better for this actually. Oh, alright. (♪Cuckoo clock.) Ooo! (Laughter.) Um... There was- then Edward. Eddy. He was the trouble maker, or so I heard. Maybe ten years old when they moved here so twelve when they all died. Ok. And um- Uh did you ever have any personal interactions with the Mulcahy's? No, I don't think so. Lot of help you are. I'm sorry I'm just messing with you. Um... You alright? I'm just tired. Ok. Alright we can stop. Do you mind? Not at all actually. Just if you can think of anything else about them- They weren't such happy memories, you know- thinking about death- and Emma. Ok. Alright, yeah we can definitely stop. Here let me take this off. When can I see this? -Oh, the project? -Yeah. Um... I don't know. When I finish it. (Laughter.) No, um, I- It's due at the end of January- Um... So, after I show it to my class I guess I could upload it online. On the internet? Yeah. Then I'll never be able to see it. (Laughter.) Should I be doing anything? Nope, just stand there and look pretty. That's what I do best. I can see that. Yeah. Oh, don't do that. No? (Laughter.) You look like Gary Busey. I'm kind of flattered by that. Alright. Ok, fifteen to twenty seconds of stillness. Ok. Oh, alright. Move over. I want to be on this side. Are you ready? Yeah. You good to go? Yeah. How hard's this going to be? Why? You nervous? No. Relax. You look good. Thank you. You do too. -Oh. Thank you. -Yeah. Um- alright. Uh... What are you holding? Uh... This is the cold case file of the Mulcahy Murders. The only exciting thing that's happened in this town. Hm. And what happened? Should I just tell you like you don't already know? This is for the people out there, right? Yeah. Make it official though, because I'll definitely use you holding this. Am I the star of your movie? -Yeah, of course. -Yeah? Cute cop in a small town. You're going to make this sucker marketable. You're such a flatterer. What's your angle? You're such a cop. I don't have an angle. Yeah you do. I'm not that cute. Can I read the file? I don't- I- See I knew you- No. I don't think I'm supposed to- -Maybe. -Ok. If you're nice to me. Ok. Alright. (Clears throat.) Describe to me what happened? Ok. One fateful night- Don't do it like that. Alright. Um... A family of four was found in their house brutally murdered. How? Well, I'm glad you asked. Uh... The Mulcahy family, that's Joseph and Rebecca and their two kids Jessica and Edward. They were found tied up and just chopped up with a hatchet. It's like a small axe. Which is the best way to describe it because that's exactly what it is. -Yeah. We know what a hatchet is. -OK. For the record. I got you. So what happened? Uh... Nobody knows. A roofer was supposed to work on their house. And he walked in, and saw that they were all tied up in separate rooms and just chopped up. Who do you think did it? I don't- I don't know. I mean the story could be that- (Dog whimper.) Oh. My gosh! Hey. I'm sorry- -Hey! -That scared- Look at you. Drooling all over. Oh my gosh. Ok. I'm going to get this. I'm recording. Ok. And um... Can you say your name please? Oh. Harold Noel. And you're retired now, but what was your occupation. Oh. General contractor. But before that, I was just kind of a handyman. Did odd jobs, you know. Worked on roofs and plumbing and carpentry. Things like that. And now I do stuff like that. Oh, ok. Cool. Um... And how long have you lived in this town? All my life. Hey, you want my resume? I can get you my resume, if you like? Oh, no sorry. I just- um... No? Just wanted a little background information just- I'm only kidding. I'm bustin' on you. Ok. So um... In 1986 you were working on roofs then? I was really kind of out of work, so I was doing odd jobs around town. Ok. And how did you get the job working for the Mulcahy's? Um- Joe was from South Boston and when I was in prison I knew a guy who knew him who was also from Southie. Oh, ok, and um- what was his name? What is this for? Oh, this is just for a school project that I'm doing. Well, I'm really not too comfortable giving people's names out who don't want their names out. Stuff like that. Listen. I'm just here helping her out, not as an officer or anything like that. -Yeah. -Is he a good cop? (Laughter.) Because I really don't like guys like this, you know. -Mm, yeah he's a good guy. -He's a good guy? Today I am. Alright. Alright. I'll tell you then. Ok. I don't know about him though. Alright. His name was O'Brien. Oh, ok. But I think he's dead now. I haven't seen him or heard from him for a long time, so. Ok. And how did Joseph Mulcahy know O'Brien? Um. Well, Mulcahy was connected at the time in Boston. Worked for Whitey himself. And um... O'Brien said, you know he also worked for him, you know. I'm not too sure about those two guys, but um... I know O'Brien was connected to him I guess at some point. Did the police know about this? I'm telling you everything I told them, s weetheart. Is there anything else you can remember? All I know is that um... O'Brien knew what town I was from, and he told me Mulcahy was moving in with his family, and um- if I ever needed a favor you know, to go down there and see him and mention his name. Joe was a good guy. He always was. Do you think the Mafia killed him? Oof. I mean, a whole family like that. I'm not sure. But um... I can tell you, he was paranoid. You know. And he never left the house. So, he must have pissed them off, I guess. I- I'm not sure. I don't know. Ok. Um... So, When you came to town, you just, uh, you knocked on their door the Mulcahy's door and asked them for a job? Well. I was out of money, and I was trying to stay clean. So uh... What I did was I- I gave them a call. You know? Rendered my services. He told me he had a roof that leaked, so I went down there and when I got there that's when um... You know. Shit got real, you know? Yeah. So when you got there, you just walked in the front door? Well, I knocked first, and uh- it was unlocked, so I opened it, and um The smell. You ever smell dead bodies before? Yeah, you don't want to. No. I um... I walked in there and um- It was all the family members. All cut up. In pieces. You seen the pictures? No. I haven't. I've seen a couple of them. I haven't seen them, no. Oh shoot! Oh man! Oh God. That tripod. Did I break it? Here, here. Let me No. It's ok. What? Um... I heard noises. I didn't tell the cops that. What do you mean? Like someone was in the house? Oh, the smell was too bad. No one could have been in that house. It was something. It was like um... (Thump.) (Drag.) (Thump.) It was something. It was something. I don't know. Shit! Crazy day tomorrow. You can go home if you want. You don't have to spend the whole day with me. Well, what are you up to tomorrow? More of this. I got the early shift, I'll be done around 3ish You want to help? Yeah. Why not? -Ok. Cool. -Yeah. Cool. Can I take a look at the police file? You promise this isn't for like national news or anything, right? Yes! Ok, fine. Because I could get in big trouble. Yeah? Yeah, that's fine. We'll do it for the school project. (Giggles.) What are we doing right now? I just want an establishing shot in the sunset. Oh, ok. You've got a good eye for this. Hey, thanks. -It's actually kind of a cute little place. -Yeah. Looks pretty good for being abandoned for thirty years. (Laughter.) Why is that? I-I don't know. I think it's because the county didn't want to pay for it. You know, to tear it down. No builders wanted to build all the way out here- Wait! What? Did you see that? What? No. In the window. No, I- I didn't see anything. No, right there in the window. I saw something move. Well, it could have just been the light or something. No, something moved in the window right there. Well, I don't- Come on, let's go up there. No. Yeah, yeah, yeah- No way, I'm not going up there- I was going to go another night- -right after you said you saw something. I don't know what it was, but let's go check it out. No, no, no, no- Come on, come on, come on. (Footsteps in the snow.) Can't this wait until I'm carrying? Wait, you think you'll need your gun? You're the one who said you saw something. What if it's like a rabid racoon or something? I got a call about those guys once, scary little guys. Come on. Let's just go. They're dangerous too. Hey, you know, you didn't grow up here, but have you heard the stories about this place I mean, I knew of it. That's the reason I decided to do this project on it. I got a buddy that tells a story about a kid that was dared to come up here and he was never seen again. What happened to him? He was never seen again. (Laughter.) I mean did you ever look into it, like as a cop? Oh, uh... Yeah. There's only one story of a missing kid around here and it was like a foster kid from Worcester. Turns out his biological mom went missing at the same time, so Huh... Probably ended up in Flordia. I feel like everyone from here ends up in Florida. I got family in Florida. Yeah, of course you do. Wait wait. Did you hear that? What? Think I heard something. What did you- What did you hear? Boo! (Scream.) Oh my gosh! I got the camera. You scared the shit out of me! (Laughter.) Oh. Cheese Louise. Oh my gosh! Woah! I think I saw something. Yeah right. No no. There's something- just moved in the window. Oh, come on. Boy who cried wolf. Give me that. No no. I'm serious. Give me, give me. How do you focus this thing? We're going in? No no. Don't go in. Stop it. Ah, it's unlocked. Look. This is against the law. We can't do this. It's unlocked. No no. Shh. Shh. It's unlocked? It's open. No no. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. I think I just saw something move- Shh! Hang on. Nothing. See? Ok. It's really dark. Oh gosh. It's so dark I can't see anything. Here. Let me take these gloves off. I have to adjust this thing. Hang on. Wait. Oh fuck. (Camera clicking.) Ok. That's good. This is the worst kind of tresspassing, ok. It's like- I can't do this. I'm a police officer. I can't be breaking the law like this. I know a lot of police officers- Woah! they abuse this, because they feel like they have power over it, but I don't. I'm a good cop. I uphold the law. Shh! What? -Did you hear something? -Yeah. What? You talking. A lot. This is- This is insane. Oh my gosh. And you're filming this. Ok? We're indicting ourselves. You're making your own evidence against us. (Creaking.) What was that? I don't know. What was it? Shh. (Squeaking.) (Bang.) Oh my gosh. What was that? It's something- Stop. Ok? Shh. Shh. Hello? Oh, God, you scared me. Hey, hey. Alright, stay here. Ok? Ok. Stay here. Ok. I will. (Squeak.) Shh. Shhhh. (Squeak.) (Squeak.) (Squeak.) (Laughter.) (Bang.) Oh my God. (Laughter.) Can we get out of here? You looked like Jackie Chan. I need to take a nap. What? Did you see this? Oh my god. Open it. You kidding me- No way. Open it, Patrick. No. No. Open it. Oh. Fuck no! (Slam.) Oh, come on, Patrick! Come on. No. That's- -Let's get out of here, ok? -No. I'm done with this. No, come on. I have even-- No. Hey Hey! seen the rest of the rooms yet. Hey Leah! Come on! Now! I haven't even seen the bedrooms. Leah! Come on! Ok? Fine. Come on. I'm leaving. He's scared. Ok. Alright. Can you see it? Are you ready? -Oh. -There it is. There it is! I left the lens cap on. Hang on. No no. Hold on. Ok. Alright, I rewind it for the... Ok. Ok. Ohp. Alright. Look at me. Alright. Ok. Hang on. Can you see the- Can you see the computer? Yeah. It's fine. Ok. I need to- This is for the- Ok. Alright. Ready? Get this on film. "Oh my god" "Woah. I think I-" There! It's uh- We just missed it. -Ok. Ready? -Ok. Here you go. "Oh my god" There! There! There is something there. I swear there was something there. You can't really see it on here, but there's something there. Ok. I totally agree with you that the curtain moved. Yes, ok. Hundred percent. I saw that for sure. But something was there. Something was there moving it. Look, you can kind of see. Ok. Here's what I think happened. That house was super drafty. We walked in- the other curtain had moved. No. I know that. I know that. The door was open. It was super drafty, so I think the curtain for sure moved. But I think what you think that you saw was actually, when the curtain moved you saw your own reflection. No, I- "Oh my God." Ok, ok. I said I don't know. Ok. There was something in the house, I swear. I saw something. It was like a shadow. It had like long hair. It just like- -Alright. It was there. There was something there. It was- It was- Look. I think Harold Noel. Just staring out at us. the roofer put us in our head. I'm not- I know I sound crazy. I know I do. And I don't want to watch the footage until I've edited it because I also just hate my voice. You have a beautiful voice. Oh. Well. Thank you. Alright. Alright. What? Nothing. It's just- I just feel like maybe a haunted house story is a really cool project. I mean, that is a midterm project right there. Can you imagine? You're like- Woah, woah, woah. This place is haunted. The ghosts of the Mulcahy's have been here- I mean, you have the video footage to prove it. That is insane. And you can interview me. We could talk about like- How? The murder. And why this- I don't know. This is just- That would be- This is a really creepy room. (Laughter.) Do you have to stay here? Are you kidding me? Yeah. Don't say that. Look at these dolls. This is where I'm sleeping. I think they're staring at me. (Laughter.) Alright, look. I think it was just a trick of the light. It couldn't have been a trick of the light. Yeah. I think it was. Ok! Let's move on. Let's do this thing. (Clears throat.) Ok. Let's put the beer down. Alright. Yes. Last sips. Ok. Last sips. Hat on? Hat off? Oo. You going to take your hat off? Hat on? No? (Laughter.) Don't look at me like that. No. It's a really good choice. It is? Yeah. Are you being serious? You should definitely leave it off. Is it bad? Your hair looks really good. Should I put it back on? I'm just kidding. Your hair does look good. Alright. Alright. Stop it. Ok. Um... Hello. I'm Leah Sullivan. And today is December 12th, 2016. (Laughter.) What? It just- Nothing. It just- What? You're really good at it. I wasn't commenting on it or anything. You laughed at me. (Laughter.) When I was in the middle of doing it. I just- I wasn't expecting it. You just transitioned. All the sudden you became like- I don't know. "Hello. This is Leah Sullivan." I became British? I don't know. It just sounded like it from sitting here. Stop it. Let me do my thing. Alright. Alright. You put me in my head about it now. Ok. Ok. This month marks the 30th anniversary- Which is crazy, by the way. What? What? I did not know that it happened in December. What did? Oh the- Yeah. Do think it's because it's like the anniversary. Like does the thirtieth year mark thing in some sort of Satanic like... There was something in the window. Hmm. Tell me more. No no. It's like- Maybe thirty years- There's like a purgatory or some sort of like- weird occult thing that like all the sudden some sort of Spirit rises and stares at us through windows. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know. It's- Alright. It's a good question? (Laughter.) I'm just saying. Alright. Let's do this. It's a cool project. (Laughter.) Ok. Can you say your name please? I feel like I should be doing- Should I be casual, or should I be like-? Alright. Dude. Just do it. It's like super whatever. I'm Patrick Rooke. Ok. That was good. And um... What do you do for a living? I'm a police officer in the town of Lutton Massachusetts. Does anything exciting ever happen in Lutton, Massachusetts. Not while I've been a police officer. Yes. The Mulcahy Murders happened in- happend in Lutton, Massachuetts thirty years ago this month. Alright. So I was thinking you could just read through the file now. Ok. This is just for a school project, right? I swear. Ok. Alright. I'm not going to get in trouble for this. No no no. Alright. Ok. Alright, well, to sum up. A family of four was found in their home. They were tied up in separate rooms of the house and just chopped up. The murder weapon was believed to have been a hatchet or some sort of heavy metal object. Um... The bruising around the wounds indicated that it required a certain amount of force. I don't think we need the demonstration. Alright. We'll start with We'll go through the family members- Oh... Oh. Yeah. Alright. The father. That's Joseph Mulcahy. He was found in the living room. He was gagged with a belt. Both his legs were chopped off. His cause of death was bleeding out from the wound in his legs. Alright. The mother. That's Rebecca Mulcahy. Yeah. Are you sure you want to see this? Yeah. I actually- Do you mind if I get some pictures of these later? Alright. Yeah, later. I mean some video of them. I don't know if that's- Ok. Um. Rebecca Mulcahy Ok. I'll be patient. Yup. She was found in her bedroom. She had- Her arm was tied to her bedpost. And then her other arm was chopped off in the same fashion as her husband's legs. Her cause of death was also bleeding out. Jessica Mulcahy- Oh my gosh. She was the last one to have been killed. According to the estimated times of deaths. Her cause of death was She had her head chopped off. She was tied up to the back patio by one of her wrists. Gosh. So glad I wasn't around to have seen this. I thought that you'd read this before. I- Well... I stopped reading after I saw Joseph Mulcahy's picture. And last is little Edward Mulcahy. And apparently least. Uhh... Nothing of Edward was found. He was just- just Just one arm was tied to his bedpost. Oh man. Yeah. That picture is- That's it. That's all it is. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Alright. Can I get some of those pictures now? Ok. So Edward's body was never found. Nope. Niether was Jessica's head, Rebecca's arm, or Joseph's legs. Wow. There's a reference here to the Vilisca Murders of 1912. I don't know what that is. Oh. It's a famous murder that happened in Iowa. Um... This whole family and these two little girls were chopped up by an axe when they were sleeping. It's really similar to the Lizzie Borden murders. Lizzie Borden is the uh...? You know Who is Lizzie Borden? Lizzie Borden took an axe gave her mother forty wacks. When she saw what she had done, she gave her father forty-one. Oh... That is the creepiest thing I've ever heard. How do you know so much about that? I find psychopaths fascinating. Ok. Well, there's no other murders that ever happened in America at that time, so that ruled out a serial killer. Hm... Maybe it was just a one time thing. They got their fill and then they, you know moved on. Or maybe it was a ghost demon with a hatchet. You're a police officer? You, really? Alright, ok. Offense taken. And this is the house. In happier times. DId you press record? Oh, yeah yeah. Are you not ready? I don't- no. I can do this. Ok. Alright. Alright. Just- Just make sure I look good, ok? No. You look great. Yeah. Yeah. I want to look hot like Madonna, ok? I'm just saying. Like a virgin. Ok. (Laughter.) Just like fifteen seconds of stillness. Ok. Fifteen? Ok. It's not that long. Ok. Are you ready? Mmhm. Yeah. Ready as I'll ever be. -Ok. Let's do it. Alright, and oh, and I know you're already doing this, but just yeah, like face the camera and just try and deliver your stuff to the camera, whenever you can think of it. Ok. You got it. Yeah. Ok. Can you say your name? Um... Margaret Stromberg. I'm Swedish. Oh really? Yeah, my dad was Swedish. I know I don't look it, but uh... mom was Irish so map of Ireland. What can I say? Alright. Cool. Um... What was your relation to Joseph Mulcahy? Uh. We were cousins. My mom and his mom were sisters. And how well did you know each other? Oh, you know. We knew each other ok. He was kind of a quiet guy, so uh... You know, I moved in with them when I was a teenager. I got booted out of the house. It's a long story, but a good one. I'll tell you later, ok. -Ok. Because it's a good story, but Um... So, I uh... My uncle Robby took me in, and I lived with them. You know, I ran the liquor store for them after Joe left town, so uh... I was pretty good at it. I have to say. I made a really good profit there the first year. I killed that place. It was awesome. Oh, wow. Um. Did Joseph have ties with the mafia? The mafia? Joe? (Laughter.) Yeah. Like Whitey Bulger and stuff? Whitey? No, no. No. He didn't. Oh my God. Where'd you hear that story? Um. The guy who found the bodies, he said that he knew Joe through somebody he went to prison with. A guy named O'Brien. Oh. Ronnie O'Brien? Oh. I don't have the first name. Oh. It's got to be Ronnie O'Brien. That makes perfect sense. Oh my God. Ronnie was a good friend of Joe's growing up. Right? And uh... He was- he thought of himself as a bad ass, right? He thought he was this cool tough hood, but basically, he just did time in jail for selling weed to the little kids in the neighborhood Oh, ok. Yeah, yeah. He had that like Napolean complex. You know what that is? Like short guys have them, you know? Oh my God. Joe's mother hated him. She called him the less smooth Eddie Haskell. You know who Eddie Haskell is right? Uh... I don't know. You know "Leave It To Beaver"? Wally's smartass friend? -Ok. "Good morning, Mrs-" No? Ok. Making me feel old now. No, I'm- Stop. It's ok. Hey, everything makes me feel old these days so it's fine. Um. So then, why did- Why did Joseph leave town? Oh. Because he was crazy. I mean. I loved him like a brother, but he was crazy. He was scared of everything from day one. You know how little kids sometimes they'll make these forts, you know. Out of blankets and pillows, sheets. You know, like over a table. You know, to make like a little secret fort. He used to do that all the time, and he would just spend all day in there. He was such a strange kid. Um. What was he so scared of? Well, what wasn't he scared of. He was scared of everything. End of the world. Nuclear war. He was scared of the neighbor next door because she had a weird laugh. She did have a really witchy weird laugh so I kind of get it but- He was always drawing these these weird kind of shadowy tall creepy figures. Odd. Do you have those drawings that he used to draw? I don't think so, I- Well, you know what? I- I might. I might. Can I go look? Oh my gosh, yeah please. It won't disturb your thing. Not at all. No no. Please do. Alright. Just give me a second. Ok. Um... It might take longer than a second. Yeah. Take your time. Because it's a mess back here. Um. So you said that Joe left town because he was scared of things Oh God, yeah. He was scared of everything from day one. Hey. Um. Do you have a boyfriend? Uh, no. Not at the moment. Oh. I have a son who's adorable. I think you'd be a cute couple. Oh, I don't know. It's not really a priority. You'd make gorgeous bab- Oh my God. What? -I cannot believe it. What, what what? You found it? I found it. I found it! Oh my gosh! Here let me help you. Oh my God. Oh wow. I know. Look at that. It's crazy. I mean it's like hoarders back there and I found it. I couldn't believe it. Oh God. So this- I took this, when my uncle Robby died I took this out of his house. Uh huh. And uh, I wanted to get one of those journals for Joe because, they were crazy and like, I thought I'd give it to him for his fiftieth birthday, you know. Ah, ok. Show him how crazy he actually was, but you know, then everything happened and uh... Yeah, yeah. Ooh! Look at that. My first wedding. Aw. You're so pretty. He was a good one. Such a cute picture. I should never have let that one go. He was really good. It's really cute. Ok. Oh. Here we go. Ah. Alright. Oh my gosh. I know. I know. This looks like a Bible. It kind of does look like a Bible. It's funny, you know, Joe always said that he could predict the future. Oh really? Yeah. He did. And he always like- write all his dark thoughts in there. So you know, and all these pictures. Very creepy. When there's no light there's a monster to fight. I run away, but with me the monster will stay. Yeah right. See? See what I'm saying? Huh. I mean, to be honest with you. We did grow up in a strange time. You know? Cold war all that stuff. Russia looming over us. Uh huh. You know, Joe always thought that there was bombs going off in the streets. In South Boston, ok? It's why he moved out of town I think. Oh my gosh. What? -Hang on. Is that what you were talking about? That's exactly what I was talking about. See? And he had like ten of these journals and this is the only one left, but they were all filled with this picture. He like- he drew that all the- It's probably in there more than once. Do you mind if I hang onto this? No. I'll bring it back for you, but I No no. Go ahead. What am I going to do with it? Thank you so much. Oh, sure sure. This is great. Um... I actually think that I have everything that I need. Oh? Yeah. No. You were so good. That was so good. Well thank you. Would you like more coffee? No. I'm all set. I actually have to go because I'm going to How bout some cake? I made a nice bundt cake. No. Thank you though. -It's good. It's kind of my specialty. I have to meet my friend in Lutton so- Ok, well. Let me get this guy off of here. Hey look, um.. There you go. Pull that through. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more of a help. Oh no. You were great. You know, if you could do me a favor and just, uh- let me know Hello. Let me know, uh- what happens. If you find anything out. Yeah. Ok. Because, you know, all these years, I haven't known. And it's just so terrible what happened to that family, so... I'd really like to know. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah yeah yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I'll be in touch. And I actually might have to come over and ask you some more questions. Oh? If you don't mind. Ok then. You're getting that cake. (Laughter.) She's getting that cake. You saw it, ok? Alright, sounds- I can clean up a little bit back here if you neet me to. No. That's actually fine. So yeah, if you can just sit still for like ten seconds. Ok. I just sit still? Yeah. You can just look straight here. Straight into the camera? Yeah. What's this for? Oh, um... I haven't uh... I haven't really decided yet. But I like the idea of starting it like this. I might have your name in the corner or something like that. Ok. Yeah. Do I have to hold my breath? No, no. Just be natural about it. Ok Ok. Mmmm. Mmmmmmm. That's actually good. I think the levels are good on that. Ok. What can I do you for? Alright. Let's just dive right into this. Let's hear some of these stories that you're famous for. I wouldn't say that I'm famous. I mean, I just told these stories to some kids at camp. Ok. However, if I am famous just call me George Clooney. Ok. Alright Mr. Clooney. Let's get into it. Ok. Hmm... Where do I begin? My uncle used to tell my sister and I these stories as a kid. Uh... I'll start with the craziest one first. Ok. Ok. So. You all know the details of the Mulcahy Massacre, correct? Happened in 1986. The family's body parts went missing. Never to be found. An arm. A leg. A torso, a head. Well. I have a friend. Fredrick, who lives close to the Mulcahy house. And he had this dog, Carl. Carl got out one night, and Fredrick wandered off into the woods, near the Mulcahy house to try and find him. When, all of the sudden, Out of nowhere, this- this blinding light came from the treeline. Well, Fredrick couldn't see. It was there for about five, six seconds and disappeared, as quick as it came. So, Fredrick trying to regain his sight, hears this weird groan off in the distance. This "Urrrgggggg" So Fredrick thinks that Carl is hurt. So Fredrick runs towards the noise. It's getting closer. This "UUuurrrrggghh! Now, Fredrick is right on this noise, and he looks up, and he sees this creature with two heads one of a teenage girl, the other of a little boy. Two legs of a grown man. A torso and an arm of a little boy. and the other arm of a full grown female. The missing body parts of the Mulcahy family. Well, Fredrick is scared out of his mind. He collapses to his knees. He thinks it's over. All of the sudden the creature vanishes. Fredrick crawls back to his house. Doesn't leave for three days. And he's laying in bed, when all of the sudden he hears this scraping at the door. Well, Fredrick goes to the door. and there he sees his dog Carl with bite marks all over him. Flesh missing everywhere. The bite marks of a little boy and a teenage girl. To this day, if you still go in the woods near the Mulcahy house, you'll find squirrels with those same bite marks. So... Aliens killed the Mulcahy's, and then, sewed them back together? Yeah. (Laughter.) I told you it was one of the crazier ones. It does the trick. Yeah. I bet. Um... Patrick said that you have one about a missing kid? Oh, oh yeah. That one's my favorite. Yeah? I have a couple others though too. I have one about this Sasquatch creature. Sometimes I make it into a Zombie lumberjack. That's a good one. I have another one too, about uh, this this this basement dungeon where all these little kids are kept. Ok, alright. Let's just do the missing kid. Ok. Hmm. Where do I begin? Uh... ok. We had these three kids that lived in the neighborhood. Jimmy, Robby, and Ian. One night, they decided to go camping off in the woods near the Mulcahy house. Around the fire, Robby recounted the dark and gruesome tale of the Mulcahy Massacre. Only this time, he made up his own ending. A little twist. He said that the house was haunted by this dark spirit, and that is what murdered the Mulcahy family. Well, Ian dared Jimmy the youngest, to spend an hour inside that house. And Jimmy, being the smallest and the youngest, decided to take on that challenge. A way of proving himself, if you will. The boys wandered off into the dark woods towards the Mulcahy house. When they reached it, Jimmy walked up to the door. He took one last look back at his friends, and went inside. Robby and Ian waited around. Twenty minutes, twenty-five minutes. They start to get bored. So they yell for Jimmy. "Jimmy!" "Times up, you can come out now!" No answer. Hm. They call out again. And again, no answer. So the boys wander into the Mulcahy house, armed only with a small flashlight, shaking. They scour around the first floor, looking for Jimmy. When all of the sudden, they hear a a whimper. a "uehhuehh" So they run towards this whimper, and they see in the middle of the room. a lump. And they run up to this lump, and they notice that it's their friend, Jimmy, lying in a pool of his own blood. One arm hacked completely off. They bend down to help Jimmy up when all of the sudden they hear a (THUMP!) (Scrape.) (Thump.) Oh my God. You ok? Yeah, what happened next? I don't know. I mean, that's where we always ended the story. One of the counselors, in the middle of the night would go around making that noise. Really freaked the kids out. What's the end of the story, though? Um, I don't really remember. I think my uncle used to say that the kids ran off and Jimmy was never heard from again. Where did your uncle hear that story? I don't know. I mean, for all I know, he could have been making them up. Is he still around? No. no. He passed away almost ten years ago. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. That's a really scary story. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. I'll definitel use that. It's good. (Buzzz.) Oh shoot. Hang on. (Buzzz.) (Buzzz.) Oh, it's Patrick. Do you mind-? No. Please. Alright. Thanks. (Buzz.) Hey what's up? Focus this close. Ok. (Knock knock knock.) Ah. Oh my- Hey. Oh. You scared me. Sorry, I was stuck on the phone. What's up? I got something to show you. Ok. Ok. (Diner music.) Alright. Go ahead. Ok. Alright. These are all missing person's files over the last thiry years. There's five people in total. Ok. I want you to go through each one of these make it detailed, but try and just state the facts, ok? Ok. Alright. Well, let's start the fact that these may not be related in anyway. I mean, they're kind of all over the place. And some of these people might just be in Florida. Ok. Understood. Alright, um... The first one is the foster kid and his biological mom. This is the one I was telling you about. I'd read this file a while ago, but I didn't think anything of it. Here's what really happened, ok? A foster kid was last seen leaving his home in Worcester. His mom's car was found a week later on Brigham Road. A few houses down from the Mulcahy house. Now, the theory is that they stayed in the Mulcahy house for a couple of nights and then were picked up and driven to the airport to fly to where ever. But nobody did any real research on it, and the investigation sort of just fell through because of jurisdiction issues between between Social Services the State Police Worcester Police and then us over here. This happened back in '91. Did anyone ever search the house? Yeah, yeah yeah. And they did find signs that someone had been living there. Or something. Alright. I'm just not ruling anything out here. Ok. This next one is from '95. This is four years later. I can do math too. This is just a couple of kids from Worcester state. They- they heard about the murders and decided to go into the house. I guess they were partying one night, got wasted, you know, presumably. They were never seen again. What? That's it? Yeah, that's it. I mean, it's the same set up. They police found their car. They organized a local search team, and couldn't find anything. The dogs couldn't even find anything. They just kept circling back to the house. -What the hell? -I know, right? -More coffee? Oh. No thanks. Ok. Alright. This one is the last one. And it's the craziest. Um... and it's technically not even a missing person's report. It's from '98. There was a girl. Ok. She was the younger sister of one of the college kids that went missing. She came into town from upstate New York, and decided to go looking for her older brother. She was last seen on December 4th. On December 8th, the Worcester Police put out a preliminary search on her rental car. I guess she was supposed to have returned it a couple days earlier. The hotel staff thought she had checked out, but just left all her stuff. It was crazy. She was found on December 10th. She was dead in the driver seat of her rental car. She had driven off the road about a mile and a half from the Mulcahy house. So, it's... But the theory is that she was looking for help. She had signs of being restrained. Wounds on her wrists indicated they were caused by ropes. Her cause of death was a large wound on her neck believed to have been caused by something similar to an axe. How did the police miss all of this? Ok. Yeah, alright. I know what you're thinking. This is terrible policing. And it was. I spoke to my boss about this very briefly this morning. He didn't want to talk about it. I had heard of this, but I didn't think everything so much. There was a police chief here, who served for twenty years. And he was forced into early retirement for negligence and misusing government funds. He did the bare minimun on all of this. In fact, he hid these two files from State Police investigators because he knew he fucked them up. We only found them last year when we upgraded the station. They were hidden in a cieling panel. It's a wonder we didn't get sued. Can you imagine the families of these people? Do you know what this means? What? We're not just reporting on a cold case anymore. This could be national news because we can actually solve it. I don't want this- national-? No. -No, no no. -And these missing people. There's- Something could be in that house. Yeah. And we're going to figure out what it is. No, we're- I'm going to figure out what it is. When I'm on duty, with a team of investigators. -No. I don't want you getting- We're the ones who figured this out. No no. I don't want you getting anywhere near that. I don't think you should be filming any more of this. Wait, you have no idea how important this is. Yeah, I do. You have no idea how big this story is. Yeah. Look, we could close a case that has been open for thirty years this month. That's insane. No, Leah. No what? No. I think you keep this as a school project. This isn't a school project. You finish interviewing the people that knew the family and you move on. You could be the first one to talk to them if the police do find something. But, there is a proper way of going about this. I don't give a shit about the proper way, Patrick. No journalist that's worth a damn, ever gave a shit about doing things the proper way. And niether do I. This is it, Patrick. Look, there might not be anything in that house at all. Exactly. So then what's the harm in checking it out. Be- Ok, what if there is something potentially dangerous in that house. What? Like a killer ghost? No, that's not what I'm- When's the last time someone disappeared? Twenty years ago? Eighteen. Yeah, exactly. Nobody's going to be there. But- Then why do we have to go at all? You can't keep me from that house. Yes. I can, ok? It's private property. What are you going to do? Keep watch all day, every day? Guard the house? Wait for a warrant? Come on, Leah. What? A killer could be in that house. We could save people from- You just said that was ridiculous. Look. I don't know. Maybe it's a copy cat or something. I have no idea.. But we have grounds to go and check it out. No, we dont. You're the one- You are the one who swore you saw something in that window. You're the one who swore it. I didn't- I don't know what I saw. And look at this. Look at this. It could have just been- It was just a- Look familiar? It looks like some deranged kid drew that. Yeah. Joseph Mulcahy drew that when he was a kid. Yeah, so? What does that have anything to do with what we're talking about? I don't know. You think that looks like the thing I saw in the window? It's a stick figure, Leah. Look. I'm going to that house. You can either come with me or you can arrest me. But I think you're just as curious about this as I am. Stop. Alright. We don't have to go crazy. We just peak in and see if we see signs of someone living there, ok? Look, it's probably impossible, but we have to check. Can you imagine what it would be like not to know what happened to your kids? Not to know what happened to your brother? Your sister? We can solve this fucking case, Patrick. You and I could uncover the truth. I don't- And you'd go without me, even if I said no. Damn right. Alright. Fine. Yeah? Yeah. Let's do it. Let's go. I'll be carrying this time, so the rabid racoon or whatever is going to go down. Hey, hey. Woah woah. We do this, we do it by my rules, ok? Ok. What are your rules? You got to listen to me, alright? Ok. I mean, that's just one rule, but I think I can handle it. Alright. Second rule. Don't be a smartass. Do you have a flashlight? Yeah. We'll need it to go into the basement. Alright. It's in my truck. Let's go get my truck. My gun's in there too. Ok. You sure you want to do this? Yeah. Yeah. Why's it got to be snowing? Here, can you hold this for a sec? Alright. That's good. Ok. Alright. Alright. Let's fucking do it. (Bird cawing.) You ready? Yeah. Ok. Let's do this. Sir, yes sir. Stay behind me, ok? Sir yes sir. I'm being serious, Leah. Ok? So stop flirting with me. Oh, don't flatter yourself. Somebody could be in that house, ok? Ok. Alright. Let's go up quietly. Sir yes sir. Alright, just wait here. Wait till I give you the all clear, ok? Oh, come on. No. I'm serious, ok? My rules. Ok. This is the police. If anybody's in there, make yourself known. Alright. I'm coming in. Stand away from the door. Just wait here, ok? Ok, ok. (SLAM!) Patrick. Patrick! Patrick? Patrick? I didn't give you the all clear. The door shut behind you. That wasn't you? No. (Creak.) (Creak.) (Slam.) Oh. Jesus. It's just the wind again. Oh my god. That scared the hell out of me. Yeah, me too. I almost shot you. What? Nothing. Look I was taking a look around. I didn't see anything, but look at this. (Camera clicking.) Now that I know all the gory details, this must be where Joe Mulcahy bled out. Oh my gosh. Did you see any signs that someone's been living here? Not yet. No. I don't like this place. Are you still filming? Yeah. I want to film in case we find anything. Anybody here? Hello! Stop it. Oh. Alright. It's not looking hopeful. Ahh. ahh. That's a lot of blood. Oh. Freaky. Yeah. This whole place is. Oof. Eoohf. That's cute. Alright. Come on. That is a creey mirror. Ok. Wow, look at this. What is it? What? These must be Rebecca's old dresses. Here. Hold this. I wonder why they left all these. So well preserved. Yeah. I know. This whole place is. Do you think one of these would fit me? Well, don't try it. I think she was about my size. No, no. Hey, can you stop touching them like that. Look at this. Alright. Woah, woah woah. Don't pull it out. Don't pull it out. Oh my gosh. If this wasn't so moth eaten. Oh gosh. I don't like this. This would be a find. I don't like this at all. Look at that. The 80's are so in right now. No no no. Ok. I'm sorry. Ok, can you put it away? Not a souvenir? No! Ok, I was just kidding. I'm sorry I'm sorry. No no no. Let's go, ok? Oh wait. Hey, look at this. Some of these hangers are empty. Maybe Rebecca Mulcahy just didn't have that many dresses. I don't know. It looks like some clothes are missing. Maybe some of the missing people are rocking the retro style down in Florida. Can we just get out of here please? Yeah. Come on. that crayon? Oof. Looks like someone punched it. I think we should go. It's getting dark out. Ok. I just want to check out the basement first real quick. We should come back another day, when it's light out. It's not going to matter down there. So we should just go into the the creepy dark basement in the murder house at night. That sounds fun. Yeah. I agree, but I don't want to come back to this house again ever. Alright so. Let's just do what we came here to do, and then leave. Maybe we'll actually find something. I don't think that's a good idea. Do you have your flashlight? Shit. I left it in the car. Ah. Can you go get it? I don't like this, ok? Please, can you just let me- you can go and get it and can you just let me borrow it. You can leave. That's a stupider idea. You're stupider. You're ridiculous. I'm not going to just leave you here. Alright, please, can you go get it? This will be the last thing we do, I promise. Please. This place isn't so bad. (Dripping.) Huh. (Dripping.) How long have you been leaking? (Dripping.) Problem solved. (Car locking.) What? What is it? Oh, nothing. Something happen? No. I just thought I heard something. Don't do that. What? Don't scare me for the sake of scaring me. No. I wasn't. I think it was just your car. Hey, look at this. What? All of these cans of food have been eaten. You think it was one of the missing people? Oh, maybe. But look at this. What? The sink was dripping. Ok? Well, I mean, You'd assume that'd been leaking for a long time, right? Like- Right. I don't know, at least eighteen years. Uh-huh. Well, there's no mineral build up or any signs of constant water flow. Look at Jessica Fletcher over here. Who's that? "Murder She Wrote" Oh right. Maybe it's leaking because we had a particularly wet year. What do you mean? Well, it runs on a well system out here so... you know. A lot of water's in there, it needs a little more- has a litlle more pressure. Oh. I guess I'm not such a Jessica Fletcher. I didn't mean to dismantle your theory. I just don't want to think about someone actually having been here. I think someone was here. Not anymore? Let's go check the basement. Do you think Joseph Mulcahy could see the future? What? Well, I mean um, I know he was just a little kid, but those journals were fucking dark. Do you think he knew how he was going to die? I don't believe in that kind of stuff. Yeah. I guess you're right. I mean- He also said the world was going to end in nuclear war. Well that could still happen. Look. Nothing's here, ok? Let's get out of here. Wait. Can I see the flashlight? Ok. Sorry. (Mouse squeak.) What's that? I don't know. What is it? (Mouse squeak.) Is it a trap? Hang on. It's alive. Oh my God. Could it have been trapped? It looks like a cage. It looks like someone's fucking pet. This is huge. Somebody must be here. Somebody must be living here. Alright. Ok. That's it. I'm done, ok? I'm leaving. No no no. This is the whole reason that we came here. This isn't why I came here, ok? I didn't want to- No. I'm- I'm leaving, ok. No, no Patrick. Listen. Listen. You have your gun, right? Yeah. Ok. So we're going to be fine. Alright. Alright. Alright. Fine. Let's just get out of this creepy ass basement, ok? (THUMP!) (SCRAPE.) (THUMP!) What the- -That's it. -What the fuck was that? That was it. What the fuck was that? That was the fucking sound! Alright. Alright. I'm going to go up there, ok? Ok. Stay close behind me. Ok. One. Two. Anybody out there? Make yourself known! Come out with your hands up. This is the police! Ok. I think this is where the sound came from. This must be the kid's room. Nobody's here. Damn. Damn? (Soft footsteps.) Look at the dresser. Damn? (Soft footsteps.) This is crazy. What is that? (Soft footsteps.) It's crayon again. -Play. (Strange breathing.) Look at it. "I saw white" (Mouse squeaking.) Eea... "I am alive"? Shh. (Mouse squeaking.) I think I hear something. Do you hear that? Wait. Where you going? I left my camera downstairs. Don't take the flashlight- I'm coming with you. I've got to film this. Oh. There it is. It's still recording. I don't like this. This basement gives me the- Let's just get out of hear, ok? First I just want to film the kids room. Really quick. You done? I haven't even shot it yet. Hold on. Oh. Come on. We'll come back when we have the fucking FBI with us. It's ok. It's ok. Just let me film this. Now, Leah. Come on. Hold on. This is important. This is evidence that wasn't in the police file. I don't care. You heard what I heard. Look around you, alright? Nobody's here. I think we should go! Now! Ok. I can't hold the camera steady with you yelling at me. Just give me thirty seconds. I don't like this. I know. Hurry. Do you think he was tied up when he was writing this? I don't know. Here. Hold the camera. No. Just do it! (Scrape.) That's the sound? That was it. So the dresser just moved on it's own up here? Give me the camera. These would have been referenced in the file if they were there when he died. So they must have been done by someone since the- since the murders? Some kind of prank or something? That's the drawing. "They scream loud when they are cut." What's that? It's a list. Papa. Mama. Jessy. Jordan. Michelle, spelled with an "S" and an "H". Harry. Harvey. No "E". Oh my god. Greg. Sarah. That's the name- They're the names of the missing people. Here. Shine the flashlight over here. Patrick. Leah. No. No. This is a sick fucking game. Oh my God. Hello! Somebody there? Show yourself! Make yourself known! This is the police! Come out with your hands up! HELLO! This isn't a joke! Come out! Who's ever there! Hello! Show yourself! This is the police! (THUMP!) (SCRAPE!) (THUMP!) Back up, Leah. Back up! Back up! Here! Hold this. I'm going in. Hello? Show yourself! (Slam!) Patrick! I thought I heard- What the fuck- What the fuck happened? I thought I heard something! Let's just get the fuck out of here- (SCREAM!) AAAH! (SCREAM!) (THUMP!) (SCRAPE!) RUN LEAH! RUN! AAAAAHHH! (THUMP!) Patrick! Holy fuck! Oh my God. Fuck. What the fuck! Where are you? (Beep. Beep.) Fuck. Fuck. (Beep. Beep.) (Sobbing.) FUCK! (THUMP!) (THUMP!) (SCREAM!) (SCREAM!) Aagh! (Roar.) (SCREAM!) (Gun shot!) (Gun shot!) (Gun shot!) (Whimper.) The car. (Whimper.) AAAh! NO! NO! (Choking.) (Door squeak.) (Door slam.) oh my God. Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? (thump.) (scrape.) (thump.) (Bird cawing.)
