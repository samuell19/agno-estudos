(slow paced music) (birds chirping) (reporters chattering) - [Mike] My Father, Michael Landon, had been loved by millions. And now that he was gone, the world would mourn with us. Mourn the loss of a man who spent his life bringing loving families and honest values into their living rooms. But my Father was much more complex than the simple, noble, men he portrayed. And his own family life didn't always mirror the television images. I am my Father's son and I have struggled with his legacy and my own. (slow paced music) - [Walkie-Talkie] Are you gonna make a move, or are you just gonna let me sit here and rot? Over. (boy burping) - Knight to king bishop three, over. (boy burping) - [Boy On Walkie-Talkie] Decent move. Pawn to king knight four, over. (car approaching) - Dad's home Jack. Gotta go, over and out. - [Girl] Move it! - Ow! Got a green one! - Cheat! Not fair! - [Boy] Sucker! Let go! I said let go! - Give him a chance to breathe! (woman screaming) - Watch out kids! - [Boy] Sorry Betty! - Where are my children! Hey! Hey, how was your day huh? - [Boy] Pretty good! - [Michael] Kisses, kisses. - I hit two homers Daddy. Brought in five runs. - Way to go Les! - Can we play three flies up? I'm up first. - Yeah we can play. Hang on a second. Lord you're beautiful. Would you marry me? - I already did. - That's a relief. (Michael laughing) All right, you got two home runs huh? Did you beat up any wimps today? - Just Mike. - You wish! - Come on, let's get our mitts. - Mike. Did you have a report card to give Dad? - Up. Now you know all I care about is you do your best. You work hard. Any bad grades in effort? - Only one, English. - Well that's one too many son. Now if you don't understand something that's one thing, but there is no excuse for laziness. If it happens again you're gonna be spending weekends up in your room, you got me? - Yes sir. - All right. - Dad, we have no school tomorrow. Can we still go to work with you? Please? - Why? - Please? - [Michael] Nothing good ever happens out there. Come on! (glass shattering) (triumphant music) (women screaming) (men grunting) (water splashing) This time, wash behind your ears! (horse neighs) Cut! Cut. Andy, Andy! You want John to direct the camera? - That was very good. - You all right? - You bet. - That was great. - All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is a wrap! Have a nice weekend! - Mike. You have time to look at a couple of script changes - No! - [Director] Before you split because you see-- - I miss my wife, - [Both Michaels] and baby girl! - [Michael Jr.] That was great Dad. - Hey, here hey wait. Now remember kids. We got an early morning tomorrow. Gotta pick up your brother Josh and go fishing! (slow paced rock music) - That's him man! I know that guy, I know him! Look Ted, it's Little Joe from Bonanza! Yo, how's Pa and Big Hoss man? Hey, show us that fast draw you got there Little Joe! (men imitate shooting) Hey Little Joe, hey, you ever seen one of these on the Ponderosa man? (men screaming) (car screeching) - Stay in the car kids. - What's he doing? - I think Dad's gonna kick their butts! (man screaming) - Now that I've got your undivided attention, it should be clear that I do not like my children exposed to that kind of disrespect. Yeah? - Uh huh, uh huh. - Clear? All right. (all laughing) (light slow music) Hey. Wake up. Rise and fish. We have a dry night? Don't worry about it. Go on, go get cleaned up. I'll take care of the sheets. - No, let me Dad. - Hey Son, you'll outgrow it, all right? Don't worry about it. At least your Mother's not gonna hang the sheets out the window like mine did. But then again, your Mother hasn't washed her sheets since I met her. Now go on, I'll stash these for Betty. Go on. - I love you Dad. - I love you more. Now go on, the fish are waiting. (kids laughing) Get 'em! Come on! (fish splashing) Here you go Son. I got one all set up for you. Hey, tell me something would ya? What's up with your brother Mark? I hardly ever see him anymore. - Nah, he's fine. He still works part-time at the market and he still plays piano every other second. - I guess he's just too grown up to come around anymore huh? - Yeah. - I can dig that. As soon as I got away from my folks I was long gone too. - Harry, quick! Get over here, get a picture! Mister, oh would you mind? Oh you don't mind do you? - Come on, come on, let's go. - [Woman] You are going to make our vacation! Do you know who this is? - Here we go. - [Woman] Oh you're so tall! You might wanna put your hand around my shoulder Mr. Landon. Oh gosh! (kids laughing) - [Michael] Hey Dodie! - [Woman] Hi. - Right on time! Come on Josh, time to go son. - Why do I have to go home so early? - Because, your mom has something special planned. Now, I promise. Next time you can spend the whole weekend okay? Come on son. We had a great time! - I feel sorry for Josh. - Yeah, me too. I'd die if I couldn't see my Dad every day. - No, no, you're wrong. - You don't know what you're talking about. - No, you're wrong. Look, if Nixon was innocent he would turn the tapes over to Judge Sirica. - You're completely missing my point. We're talking about the system here. We're talking about political sabotage, partisan politics at it's finest. That's what we're talking about. - Of course it's much easier to blame the system than hold the individual accountable, right? - Lynn, I love your brother, but he's full of crap. Michael. Pass the tartar sauce would ya son? - The man is a liar and a thief. - Bob, never argue with someone that loves to argue. - Lynn, we're not arguing. We're debating about the best foreign policy president this country has ever had. That's what we're doing. - Oh man. - Excuse me. (Michael sneezes) - [Bob And Les] Bless you. - God bless you. - [Everyone] Aw! (everyone laughing) - Michael. - What? - What you're teaching the children. Oh! - Come on, lighten up. - Awe geez, he's choking again. - Give him some air. - Do something. - Come here, come here. - Mike. - [Michael] Come on, up you go. Come on. He's all right. - I told him to eat slowly and to chew his food. I have told him a million times! - It's all right. Next time, chew better. All right son? - How many times have I told you this? Mike, how many times have I told you to chew your food? You scared me to death. - But Nixon is not as out of line as you think he is. - [Bob] Oh come on. - [Mike] Woo hoo! (water splashing) Here I go! I get the pole first! - [Les] No! - [Mike] Take that! (slow paced music) - I've been looking at some houses in Beverly Hills. I want you to look with me. - Aren't you happy here? - Yes, I'm happy. That's not it. The truth is, we've run out of bedrooms. - What do you mean we've... Why didn't you tell me that before! - Oh, well you were too busy shoving food up your nose for one thing. - Oh Lynn baby, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I never though that this could happen. - Well we always planned for a big family. - No, no, no, I mean I never thought that I would be part of a happy family. I just never thought it was possible. - Well it is and you are. - I love you so much. The kids. Hey kids, kids, kids! Listen up! We're having a baby. We're having a baby! (Lynn and Michael laughing) - [Lynn] So, is that okay with you? - [Kids] Yeah! - Is that okay with you? - It's okay with me. (slow paced music) - Yes, careful, careful! This is so exciting! I can't believe it. I can't believe you bought us such a great house. - Hey, every woman needs a 20,000 square foot house with nine bedrooms. - And 13 bathrooms. - To buy toilet paper by the case. (both laughing) Uh-oh. Yeah. Hey kids. Come on, why the glum faces? - It's gonna be so different living here. - Ah sweetheart-- - I miss the old house already. - Come here. Have you been thinking about how much fun we can have here? We can go swimming, we can play baseball, you can play tennis. - It's so big. - Son, everything's gonna be the same as it was, only bigger. Come on, look up there. See that? That is your room. Michael, you're gonna have practically the whole front of the house to yourself. (light gentle music) - Jack, how did your parents act before they got divorced? I mean, were there any signs? Over. - [Jack] You mean like fighting over everything or not speaking at all, and traveling alone? Bishop to queen rook five. Why? - I don't know. It's nothing, nevermind. Hey, Dad's home, over and out. (upbeat gentle music) Out of the way! - [Les] Shawna, Chris, Dad's home! - [Shawna] Daddy, Daddy! - [Chris] Me first, me! - [Les] Nope, get out of my way! (kids shouting) - Hey kids, kids, kids! - [Les] Hi Dad! - Hi. Hey, come on, you gotta let me get in the house. - Kisses Daddy, kisses! (kids shouting) - Chris, you're getting too heavy for this! Listen, I can't hear you when you're talking at the same time! - Hey Dad, check out - Chris, come on now. - My report card. - Quiet! - [Michael] Would you be quiet son! - [Lynn] Shawna, come on, Chris. I have told you about this. Sweetheart, I'm sorry. Did you have a hard day? - Yeah, I just need a little-- - Chris. - I just need a little peace, that's all. - Okay everybody, we're due at Antonio's in one hour. - No, no, no, no. - [Michael] Honey, we're not going to Antonio's tonight are we? - You forgot. That's okay, I'll cancel. - No, that's fine. - You've had a hard day, I'll cancel-- - No, it's fine! It's fine. We'll go. - Let's get something done with your hair. Come on. Betty, help me get these kids together! Come on now, come on, let's go. And how many times I have to tell you not to trip on your Father when he comes through the door. - No, no, no, no. (speaking foreign language) - Thank you. Mikey, Mikey, Mikey! You're getting to be a big kid now, huh? You look just like your Papa. Listen, you ever want a job, you come see Antonio, all right? - Thank you sir, that's quite an offer. (Michael laughing) - Thank you. - I'd have to be pretty desperate to work here, huh Dad? - Hey, don't you be so cocky Son. Most people work their butts off their entire lives without any recognition whatsoever. I mean, you try hawking studio ads like my old man did. Only to drop dead in a bowl of soup. If I didn't go to audition with a friend, and get lucky enough to get an acting job, I'd still be unloading freight cars and you sure wouldn't be sitting here tonight where you are mister. - Do I get something to drink? - Yeah. Hey. How about a glass of Mrs. Landon's favorite red wine? - I never used to have to ask. What's going on? - I have a basketball game on Saturday. - Honey, I was talking to Dad. - Yeah, just a makeup girl. She's young, she makes mistakes. - Why does she get to you so? - I don't know. - Hey, how about a barbecue this weekend? It's been so long since we've had-- - Son, I was thinking about maybe going fishing this weekend. - That's even better! - No, I was thinking about going alone. Look son, I'm worn out. All right, I need a little space, a little room to myself. - Yeah. - I think that's a great idea. You give so much to everyone, to us, I think you probably need some time for yourself. - [Michael] Well thank you sweetheart. (rushing winds) (bird cawing) (metal clanking) (crowd shouting) - You're our hero Mike! (car approaching) - Hey, how was fishing? - Hi Son! Time alone is just what I needed. Casting into the wind, the warm sand. - Your rod's so clean. So is your tackle box. - Hi, how was it? Fish biting? - No. I'm a little tired sweetheart. I'm gonna go take a nap. (somber music) (phone ringing) - [Man On Phone] Perry Investigations. - Yes. - [Perry Investigations] May I help you? - I have a situation here and-- - [Perry Investigations] What can we do for you? - It's probably nothing. - See ya later guys. - That was a great play in the ninth Son! And you reached right up and grabbed that ball out of the sky! - You're embarrassing. - Thanks Dad. - [Father] Look, week after week you're embarrassing me, why is that? Huh? - What a jerk. I wonder if that guy has any idea what he's doing to his son. - When we get home, you're gonna take so many round balls until you get-- - He's gonna miss the ball... You know something, that's exactly what my mother used to do. One day I was maybe 14-years-old out in front of our drug store with a bunch of my friends, right. Taxi cab comes screaming up to the front, she jumps out starts hitting me over the head with a coat hanger. Calling me all kinds of names in front of my friends. - So what'd you do? - What'd I do? I made like it was a joke. I said, "Hey guys, I think I gotta go. "My mother wants me." Sometimes I wanna punch her lights out. - So Dad, is everything all right with you and Mom? - You know what that guy oughta do? He ought to tell his Son, "Son listen, some balls are bound to get by you. "But just don't beat yourself up if they do." - [Shawna] Santa came! Santa came! Santa came! - Presents, presents! - [Shawna] Santa came! - [Lynn] Merry Christmas! - This is a moment we don't wanna forget. (camera shutters) - Cut! Thanks Mr. Landon. Nice work kids. All right, we'll reset for Mother's closeup. - Mrs. Landon, a call for you. - Hello. - [Perry Investigations] Mrs. Landon. - [Lynn] Yes. - [Perry Investigations] Perry Investigations. I have information for you. I'm sorry to confirm your husband is having an affair with the makeup artist on his show. I have dates, times, and photographs. - Thank you, I'll get back to you. - Hey Lynn. Lynn. Sweetheart, what's the matter? - Why don't you tell me about your little secret? - Dad, Shawna hit me with her action figure again. - Hey, well why don't we just go talk to your sister about that huh? - Hey, I've been trying to raise you. What are you doing? - Dreaming of snow and ice. Hey! How about we get two ice blocks from the ice shed and slide down the hill at the country club? - Yeah, like that could really happen. - No man, I've done it. I know I got a picture here. Here, see. Aspen. Man, what's with you? - Something's going on at home. I think it's serious. I mean, I never could talk to my Mom before, but now my Dad's getting weird too. - You're 15 man. You're not supposed to talk to your parents. They hate you, you hate them. Why do you think my Mom has me here in the guest house? - But it's different at my house! I mean, my Dad's the best! He's everything! - It's like that in everybody's house man. Just some of us are better at hiding it. - You think this stuff helps? - Maybe. Sometimes. - Too many things are changing. Keep it on our channel Jack. - These just arrived from Dad. He has to shoot late so he's gonna meet you there. Aren't they beautiful? - I don't know what your Dad wants from me. One minute I'm a queen, the next minute I'm an absolute stranger. - Where's that silvery eyeshadow that you like so much? Let me help? - You know, when your Father and I were... When your Father was with Dodie, you know, he came after me. I didn't go after him. I never wanted to be any kind of homewrecker or any... - Mom, what are you talking about? - [Bob] Knock knock! - [Les] Hi. - Hi, may I approach the bench? - Yeah, listen. Talk to Mom 'cause she's weirding out and I need to go find some eyeshadow. - You okay sis? - He told me the affair was over. I have to believe him. I have to give my marriage a chance. - I know. I know you do. - Sit still, you keep moving! - I keep moving so you can get it in my mouth! - Uh-uh. - Okay shh, it's time. Listen. - And now, for the favorite dramatic television program, the nominations are, "Family." (audience applauding) - Stop, stop it Chris! Look, there's Dad, look. - "Quincy!" - "Little House on the Prairie." (audience applauding) And your favorite is, "Little House on the Prairie." (kids shouting) - Thank you. I'm especially proud of this award. I love television. It's one heck of a medium. - Mom sure looks nervous. - [Dad] And if our show causes one child to pick up a book and read it, then I'm especially proud. Because hey, Mom and Dad, if we don't start talking to our families then I'm afraid we're gonna have dire problems. - Mom, isn't it great? Dad won! What's going on? - Come here. Sit down sweetheart. Leslie, you know how much I love you. I mean, you're so pretty. - [Les] Dad, what's going on? - I tried not to... Sweetie, I tried really hard not to hurt anybody. - What are you talking about? - Your Daddy has met and fallen in love with another woman. Please don't hate me sweetheart. - No! (Les sobbing) - Leslie, please don't! - No! - Leslie. Go to your room. What did you say to her? - I told her the truth. - Oh. What is the truth Mike? That you just led me to the apartment of the woman you're sleeping with? - No, I didn't lead you anywhere, you followed me, remember? - You told me it was over. - I thought it was over. I just can't seem to help myself. I'm all screwed up in the head. Listen, sweetheart, it's not you, it's me. I'm just not excited about my work anymore. - Oh. You're not excited. How can you be so selfish! - I'm not excited about - We have built something - Anything anymore Lynn, - Here Mike! - [Michael] And it's tearing me apart! I mean, people, they see a whole different thing, but I feel like, I feel like nothing. - Oh please. - I even think that you and the kids, that you don't love me for who I am. You love me for what I'm supposed to be. - Oh my god. - Would you listen to me! - I can't believe! - [Lynn] I can't believe you're saying this to me. Fine, fine! Then quit the business! Who cares! I don't care if you are a plumber, a movie star, just don't destroy... - You don't care? - [Michael] Look at what I've given you! I've given you everything you ever wanted in your whole life! And I've lived like a saint through the whole damn thing! - Mike. Mike, this is our life. We have a life and have a happy family. We have obligations-- - I don't want anymore obligations! I've got enough obligations Lynn. What I want is her. I want her excitement about my work. I want her innocence. Lynn, I want-- - Her youth won't bring back yours. - No. - [Lynn] I don't deserve this. - No honey, but I deserve this. I deserve this. (solemn music) - Get out. Get out! (solemn music) - If Daddy doesn't live here anymore is he homeless? Has he been out in the cold? - No, I told you. He was living in a hotel but now he has a real house and we can go visit him. - [Shawna] He's here! - Hey Dad. Yeah, I missed you too. Yeah, I'm doing great, just great. You'll work things out. You always do. - [Kids] Daddy! Daddy! - [Shawna] Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! - Hey, hey, oh! How are ya? - [Chris] I missed you. - Do you have everything? - Missed you too son. - [Shawna] Are you cold Daddy? - No sweetheart I'm not cold, are you? - No. - You look good. - Thank you, so do you. - Hey Dad. - Hey Son. Come on, let's go, let's go. Get in the car! Get in the car! - Wear your jackets, okay! - [Shawna] Daddy, blue, pink, and white checkered bag! - [Mike] I got shotgun! - [Michael] Okay fine, go ahead. - Bye. (upbeat music) - [Les] Are you guys getting dizzy now? (kids laughing) - [Michael] Come on, you gotta hang onto the horse! - [Les] You're sitting on my leg! - [Michael] Make a funny face. - Should we? Should we? Let's go. - Hey, "Your fortune will soon await you." - I hope it's not talking about your inheritance. - Dad. - What's a harry tance? - Well son, a harry tance is a ferocious monster that makes families fight one another. - That's silly. - Come on Daddy, read yours! - All right sweetheart. Let's see. "You will soon meet a mysterious stranger." Terrific. As if I don't have enough trouble as it is, right? Hey kids, I'm really glad we had a chance to spend some time together. You have fun? You have fun with me, huh? - I liked the haunted house best. - I liked the real fortune teller lady best. - Oh yeah? What real fortune did the lady tell ya? - I asked her if you and Mommy would get back together and she said yes! - She doesn't even know our Mom. I need a fork. - Chris, Son, I think the lady might know her stuff. I mean, I'm still hoping that your Mom and I get back together. - Well that depends Dad. - Depends on what Les? - Are you still seeing, you know? - I'll get you a fork Chris. - No. I'm not sweetheart, that's over. - Good. - Hey, where's the silverware in this place? - Sweetheart, slow down. Come on, if you keep eating like that you'll be as big as a barn. (Shawna giggles) - Whoa! Diamond earrings! Hey, who do these belong to? - I don't know Son, maybe the cleaning lady? What do ya say kids? Do you want ice cream or a movie? - [Kids] Ice cream and a movie! - How 'bout you Son, what do you say? Ice cream, a movie, what? - Whatever. I got things to do at home. - Sweetheart, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead, eat, it's good. - [Intercom] Rollbacks on two. Brad, rollbacks on check stand two. - He is arrogant, he is thoughtless. How can he do this to her huh? How can he do this? He's just, we're just so far beneath him? Or he's so far above common decency? - [Bob] Calm down. I mean, you should think this through. - Look, I've thought it through. I am not gonna stick around for this. I am not gonna let me rub my nose in it. He's moved on. I'm taking the kids to Mexico. - [Man] Stop by when you're done. - Oh okay, thank you. - All right, there ya go. (faint rock music) - Mom. Does this make me look fat? Dad said that I looked fat. - No honey, you look fine, just-- (phone ringing) Well when you bend over like that it-- Hello. Hi Bob. - [Bob] Is this a bad time? - No, it's okay, just tell me. - [Bob] Michael's filed for divorce. (somber music) - Okay, I guess that's it then. - [Bob] Sorry. - That was Uncle Bob. Your Father filed for divorce. - But, the fortune teller lady said-- - She wasn't real Shawna. Just pretend. - Does this mean we can't go out and have fun? - No, it doesn't. I'll be damned if we're gonna sit around here in this room and mope. We are gonna have fun. (upbeat music) I'm sorry? - What a bozo, what's he want? - Our Mother. - Mom! That's sickening! What a jerk. All right, that's it, I'm outta here! - What are you doing? - Hey! - Hey yourself all right! - [Lynn] What? - I'm going back, I need some money for a taxi. - Honey, do you have to? The money's in my purse. - Yeah, so I wanna leave now! - Where are your manners you punk? You insult me, my partner-- - Hey, she's not your partner all right greaseball! Hey, do that again and I'm again belt ya! (men grunting) (man speaking foreign language) - Michael! - Aye, aye, aye! (Michael grunting) - What are you doing? - Trying to get away from you! - Oh, I see, it's okay for your Father to live with someone but I can't even have a dance? - No! None of it's okay all right! I mean, there's four kids at home and neither one of you are thinking about us! - Michael! Michael! (slow paced music) Hey. Come here. The last time I nursed a black eye it was your Dad's. Would you believe he got in a fight over some wig I was wearing? A big ole pink puffy thing and it didn't even look like hair. Well he'd had a little too much to drink and he decided it was time to defend my honor. - You wore a pink wig? - Yes. It was very much the style. And if there's one thing your Father demanded of me, it was to be stylish. You know, you really reminded me of him back there. So brave, and handsome, and foolish. - I didn't feel so brave. I'm scared. - I know honey. We all are. - [Betty] Come on, come on, don't run! - [Shawna] Come on! - Come on, come on, come on. (door knocking) - Mom? His stuff's gone. He took everything. - He probably just wanted to spare you kids the pain. (Mom sobbing) I miss him. I miss him so much. (Lynn crying) - He'll be back. On weekends. Buy you stuff you really don't need. - Dad knows he screwed up. He'll fix things. He always does. - Yeah, he was just on vacation for a while with someone besides your Mom. - Shut up Jack! - Hey, it's tougher for you. Everyone knows who your Dad is. And the rep you gotta live up to. Never thought I'd be thankful to my Dad for being a nobody. Hey, where are you going now? - I've always wanted to go into that house, and I'm going to. - What if somebody's home? - So don't let 'em see you. (knob clanking) (steps thudding) Shh. (Jack laughing) Wow, check this out. - Whoa! (harp chiming) - [Mike] Whoa dude, this place is creepy. - It's pretty cool to me. - [Mike] Oh cool! Give me one of those! - Oh yeah. Ooh. - [Man] Who's in here? (gun clicking) - [Jack] Mike. - [Homeowner] Turn around and move back the way you came. If it happens again I call the cops! - Is that cool or what man? What the! What the hell! - You almost got us killed! - Dude, what are you talking about! That guy was running on unleaded gas! - I'm not listening to you anymore. (Mike grunting) ♪ We are going to Malibu, Malibu, to Malibu ♪ ♪ We are going to Malibu - [Michael] We're gonna go to the beach house! - [Shawna] Come on Daddy! Help me up, help me up! - That's it Michael, I'm not gonna lie for you anymore. You're gonna have to find a way to face him and deal with his new life. - I'm not ready to meet her. What about you Mom? What kind of life is getting all fixed up for him? And then to spend the rest of the day in bed? - Come on, come on! (kids screaming) - Get it! Shawna, run! Run with it, run! Run, faster, faster! Faster! Faster! I love you. Go! - What is it Betty? What's so important? - [Betty] There's someone here to see you. - Dad! - [Michael] Ta-da! - What oh what no way! (Michael laughing) - Hey, happy birthday big ole boy! Here you go. - No way, this is so incredible! Hey, let's go for a spin, you can be my first passenger! Santa Barbara? - Son I can't. - [Michael] I'm already a little late for Cindy's. You understand, right? But hey, we're still on to meet her next week, right? - Sure, right. - All right. Hey, Son, enjoy it! He made everybody turn around and up out of the water comes nothing but, nothing but skin and black eyebrows, right? (everyone laughing) Looking for his, trying to put his hair back on. We had a two hour break that day because they had to dry his hairpiece to put it back on. Hey, hey, listen. I'll meet you over there then. Come on, come on kids. Listen, Cindy is really kind of nervous about meeting you two. She wants to make sure that you like her. Now you're gonna like her. You're gonna love her. She's funny, she's cute, and, here she is! Cindy, I want you to meet my kids. This is Mike Jr. - Hi. - Hello. - And this, this is my Leslie. - Hi Cindy. I like your blouse. - Thanks. I like yours too. - Ain't that just like two women? They're always yakking about clothes Son. Excuse me! (Michael sneezes) - [Cindy] Bless you. - Whew! (Cindy screams) What? - That is terrible. - What, what's so funny? (Michael laughing) - That was our joke. (somber music) - Excuse me. Son. Son, look, listen to me. Look, your Mom, she just wanted a different deal. The big house, the fancy clothes, the Beverly Hills lunches. I mean, it's fine, but it's just not me. Listen, Cindy likes the same things that I like. It's a simple life. Son, you understand what I'm trying to tell ya? - Yeah Dad. Yeah I do. (engine turns) (car revs) (rock music) - Oh, hey man, how'd it go? - Race you to the bottom? - On this road, we'll kill ourselves. - Too bad. (car screeching) (Michael laughing) Woo! Yeah baby! (car screeching) Oh, oh you wanna see this? You wanna see this? Come on baby, let's go! Woo! No way! Sucker! - Mike! Mike slow down! (car screeching) - Nice to see ya! Bye-bye! - Mike! Mike slow down! Mike! - Oh god! (car crashing) (car scraping) - Mikey! Oh my god! Mike! Mike, why did I ever listen to you! Mike, help, someone! (crickets chirping) - 80 miles an hour Michael? 80 miles an hour? What were you thinking! Well you weren't thinking, that's the problem. So you met his lover, so what! You could have killed yourself! Or somebody else for that matter! This behavior has got to stop! Do you hear me! (solemn music) (rushing winds) (light gentle music) (metal clanking) (crowd shouting) - [Woman] We love you! You're our hero Mike! - [Michael] Appreciate it. Thanks for watching. - Dad? Daddy! - [Michael] All right, I'll sign. - Where's my Dad! - What's your name? - [Michael] I'll get to you. I'll get all of you. Hey, thank you. - Dad! Dad! - [Lynn] Michael! Michael! - What now? - I warned you, I warned you. Michael, how many times did I tell you? How many times did we talk about this? I warned you that if you stopped applying yourself, you would be on your own. - What are you talking about? I'm working my butt off. - Save it. You've been kicked out of SC. Your Father and I are cutting off your money. - Cutting me off? How the hell do you expect me to pay for anything? - Well, let's see. You might start by getting a job. - You know, it's a good thing he's not cutting your money off, or you'd have to get a job too. (Mike chuckles) - That's it, you are out. You're 20-years-old! It's time to grow up! - Whoa! Hey Jack. You didn't call me back. - I've been busy man, school. You know, life. - So can I stay here or not? - Sorry, it's my Mom. She thinks you really lost it man. Afraid you'll burn the house down or something. Hey look, I gotta go. - What are you doing here? Why aren't you in school? - I got kicked out. - Oh no. Did Mom go off? - Oh that's an understatement. Yeah, look, I need to crash with you for a while until I get a job, okay? Thanks sis. - [Leslie] Sure. - I don't really even have dish washing experience. We had housekeepers. But I hope-- - You're gonna be fine Mikey, fine. (people chattering) And I'm gonna have a special for you. Mikey, Mikey, bread, water. Come on, presto eh. I have wonderful things I'm gonna make with my own hands-- (glass shattering) Mamma mia, come on. Quick, pick, pick. That's Michael Landon's kid. You know, I'm trying to train him. - Hey. Man. Must be something either really good or really bad. (chips crunching) "Michael Landon's mistress pregnant." Why do they print that stuff? Come on Les, we figured this would happen. - We are already so distanced from him. With a baby I know it'll get worse. - Worse? We hardly ever see him now. - Well maybe if we get him off by himself. You know, let him know how we really feel. - Yeah. Yeah, maybe we can tell him what we feel and he'll argue about how we really feel. You wanna slow down on those things? You keep eating like that you're gonna get fat. - Dad is bad enough. I don't need it from you too. (somber music) - Les, I'm sorry! (door knocking) Hey Les! (Leslie gagging) Oh god. - I really loved last weeks show Dad. - I think you're writing and editing so much, you must miss directing. Not that you misdirect. - All right, let's cut through it shall we? What do you guys want? - Well, you know, things have obviously been different lately, you've been so preoccupied lately that we just... Now with Cindy pregnant, we're feeling like-- - Shawna and Chris, now they're too young to judge me. But I see that you two more than make up the difference, don't you? Hang on. What about my right to be happy? I mean, how come you don't want me to be happy? Kids, come on. I mean, what's the matter with me being happy once in a while? - Of course we want you to be happy. It's just that we're afraid-- - What are you afraid of? Afraid of what? - Of losing you more than we already have. - Michael, I'm right here. You wanna talk to me, I'm here. Talk to me, what is it, what do you want? Hm? I know what you want. Son I can't give that to you anymore. Listen kids, sometimes people, they just grow apart. Now why does it have to be such a big problem? - You don't get it. - I don't get what Michael? What is it that I don't get? That you two don't want me to be happy because something has changed between your mother and I and now you want me to be miserable too. Is that it? Is that what I don't get? (door slamming) Now you've gone and upset Cindy. Are you happy? - This isn't about her! God I am so pissed! (wall banging) - Go on Michael, go on! Get mad, get angry! Beat me up. (slow paced music) - My hand hurts. Do you got any aspirin? - I must've eaten something bad. - Even if I don't see you do it, I can tell, by your bloodshot eyes and the smell. You make yourself puke every day. - Please don't tell Mom and Dad. - Promise me you're gonna get some help. - I just thought that if I was thinner that Dad-- - Would care about you more? We're on our own now. We gotta look out for each other. You hear me? Come here. It's okay. It's okay. (slow paced music) (doorbell ringing) - Dodie, it's Lynn. Lynn Landon. - Been a long time. - I know this is years late, but I never understood until now, until it happened to me. I need to apologize to you for the affair I had with Mike. I had absolutely no right. - You know, I never even think about it anymore. It's ancient history. (light gentle music) - [Priest] To join in holy matrimony, this man, this woman. We ask God's blessing on them and also upon all those gathered here this day with them. May god cause Michael and Cindy to prosper in their new life together. And may they learn to share together an understanding in joys and triumphs. - Like many of you here today, I had a hit and miss church upbringing. I knew a lot about God, but I didn't really know Him. And that's how most people are. They know about Him, but do they really know Him? And I found myself sitting in a setback in life. And when you have a setback it's easy to keep taking a set back and I was like to prodigal Son who lost everything he had on riotous living. But one day, something changed. I found my Father. God the Father. He changed my life from the inside out and gave me a reason to live, forever. (seagull squawking) - [Mike] Hey Dad. - Son. Been a while since you been out. Kind of like your step-brothers coming around less and less. How's it going? - It's going okay. Shooting some industrial videos during the day and still at Antonio's at night. - So how is your Mother? - She's doing great. - Shawna and Christ tell me she's been going to church. - It's true. - No, no. My Mother was raised Catholic you know, she always told Dad and me we were gonna burn in hell because we were Jewish. Of course, that was after she made me study the Torah for a year to get bar mitzvahs. - Did she ever make you go to church? - What, you kidding me? Son, we were one of the only two Jewish families in a town full of antisemetics. We couldn't even date girls who went to church. Kids used to feel my forehead to see if I had horns or not. - Pretty stupid kids. - Yeah. The double whammy came right on my bar mitzvah day. See, that's when dear old Mom told me that it was all meaningless. Yeah, she had me baptized as a baby without my Father even knowing it. So it was just a joke. A joke she and him played to see who could outdo the other one. But do you know what? In spite of all that, I knew that she didn't just find God in a book or some building somewhere. Nah, I knew that you could find God right out here. Roar of the ocean. Your smile. The smiles of the little boy. And in my work. Now this kid from Collingswood, New Jersey who's playing an angel on TV. I mean, go figure. - But that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I was wondering if there's something for me to do on "Highway." 'Cause I need a real job Dad. A career I can build. - All right. Camera department. You start at the very bottom. You do exactly as you're told, and if you screw anything up, I don't want you to come running to me to bail you out, you got it? - I won't let you down Dad. Thanks. Oh God! Shit. I'm sorry man, my alarm didn't go off. - The cart's a mess. You're making me look real bad man. - [Man] Come on Junior, ready to shoot. - I can't, nothing's loaded. - Damn it Mike, this is inexcusable. - I'm sorry Mr. Glenn-- - No, no, no, sorry doesn't cut it. You didn't do your job and because of your screw up, you're wasting a lot of peoples time. I have never had a crew that shut a company down. I don't care who your Father is, now you get your lazy ass in gear, get the right film off the truck and loaded in five or you're fired. - [Man] Okay, let's rehearse it! Let's go, come on! - [Michael] Would you look at this picture? Is this not the most beautiful baby you've ever seen in your whole life? - [Man] I wanna see that face. - [Michael] Look at that face huh? Look at her, gorgeous. - You do a lot of things well, but I think this is the best. You make great babies. - Well I pick great Mama's. That's the trick. Cindy had this baby, look at that, without a hitch and she looks really great. I got beautiful girls and I have never been happier in my whole life. Never been happier! Look at this, whoa! Hi, hi, hi! (rain pouring) - [Mike] Hey. - I didn't see your car out front. - [Mike] I took a walk, I had to think. How does a man trade in one family for another again and again? "Hey, these kids are getting too damn old. "I'll make some younger ones that can't talk back." You know, I used to feel sorry for my step-brother Josh. (somber music) Now I am Josh. How does a man leave his family and not even say he's sorry? - I don't know. (thunder rumbling) Hell, this whole thing could be eating him up too. - Every rule Dad taught us, he's broken. He's lied, he's cheated-- - Who doesn't? Come on, let's go inside. - Hey, maybe my childhood was an illusion. Maybe it was just a movie Dad ran, right? I made it all up. Take me home. - Where is home these days? Hey, you're wasted, get back in the car! - No! I told ya, I'm going home! - Come on Mike! You don't even live here anymore! Hey, I'm leaving Mike! (door banging) (dog barking) Hey, this is it Mike! Get in or I'm leaving! (door banging) - [Homeowner] Who is it? - I grew up here. I wanna look around. - You go away before I call the police! - No, I just wanna see my old room! - [Homeowner] Hey, I'm gonna call the cops! (somber music) (thunder rumbling) - I need you Father. I need you. - There's some of you that are here today and you realize there must be more to life than just barely getting by, and you wanna change. I want every head bowed and every eye closed. And some of you need to receive the Lord into your life. If that's you, if you want that change today, I want you to lift your hand right now. And by that you're saying "Yes God, change my life." So you editing all weekend or? - [Michael] Nope, moving this weekend. - Moving? - Yeah. Cindy found a bigger house in Malibu. Yeah, this way she can ride her horses and I can get back into playing tennis. Kids can have a pool to swim in. - [Man] Mr. Landon! - Yeah! My guest from Make-A-Wish is here. Enjoy. Hey! Welcome to the set! - Glad to see you're still keeping it simple Dad. - Hi. - Karen. Look, you look beautiful. - Thanks! - Look at you! - [Michael] Come on, I want you to meet everybody. Hey Dad, how are you? - This show's great for all the screwed up families out there. Which is every family I know. - Not mine. My family's always been there for me when I needed them. You know, my parents, they are so much in love, it's really wonderful to see them. - Hi. (slow paced music) You know what was amazing? Hearing you talk about your family the other day. Reminded me of my childhood. I knew if there was a pretty face behind that voice, I had to meet you. - So what took you so long? - Two weeks? Two weeks is long? - It seemed like forever to me. - [Mike] Well, your face wasn't that pretty. - Hey. - It was gorgeous. I guess I just had to find my nerve. I found my nerve, lost my vision. - How's that? - We fogged up my glasses. (both laughing) (both screaming) Oh my God! (people chattering) Here you go Dad. - Hey, thank you Son. - No problem. (baby crying) - Can you imagine living down here? I mean think about it. Trying to raise a family under these circumstances. - I don't know how they do it. - I don't either. - You know Sheree, the girl I've been seeing? - Yeah. - I've asked her to marry me. - You're kidding! Well how long you been seeing her Son? - Over a year. The wedding's in December. - December? Congratulations Son. - [Mike] Thanks Dad. - Come here, come on. Of course, you know, if I had to do it all over again, I'd probably wait, a little older. You know, live a little. It's like Hemingway said, "True love always ends badly," unless both people are fortunate enough to die in the same accident. But they're just chasing misery and they're gonna catch it. - [Woman] Can we get craft services over here! - Come on, I'm kidding, I'm kidding! Lighten up! Hey Andy! My 23-year-old Son's getting married! - [Andy] That's wonderful! - Sorry I'm late. So, you know the tent people just informed me that they won't guarantee against leaks in December. So I think we should move the reception to a hotel. What do you think? - Who wants to hassle with weather and tents? I think we should wait. You know, not force this. - Hassle? Force this? How can you even say those words? What's happened? - Nothing. - Not good enough Mike, talk to me. - I don't know. I was talking to my Dad-- - Ugh, you're not marrying your Father, you're marrying me. - Sheree, wait. And you know it's not because I don't love ya. Because I do. Just that I'm scared. I'm scared that I'm gonna end up just like him. You know, and leave you and not really know why. - Mike, you recognize your fear, we're talking about it, the cycle's already broken. - You're right. I'm not like my Father. I don't need to look to him for approval. I just need to look inside. And inside I find us. (light gentle music) (camera shutters) - That's good. That's fine. Hey Son, congratulations Son. - Thanks. - Awe, she's a beaut Michael. She's kind, she's pretty. I think you two are gonna build, build a fine, fine life together Son. I think you finally got everything you need. - Thanks Dad. I couldn't agree with you more. - All right, come on. Let's get some food. How about a drink. - Let's dance. ♪ Happy anniversary to us ♪ Happy anniversary to us - Wow. Oh, no bubbly for me. - But this is a special occasion. - Doctor's orders. - What? (Sheree giggling) What? Are you, are you kidding? - Congratulations Daddy. - I'm gonna be a Dad. Oh my God! Oh my God. - Isn't it wonderful? - I love you so much. - I love you. (Sheree giggling) Mom! Here's your first look at your new grandchild. You're gonna love this. You can't believe how active this little one is. What's wrong? (solemn music) - [Lynn] Your Dad called. He'd like all the kids to meet him down at the house. - [Mike] Why? - [Lynn] Just call your Dad honey. - [Mike] Mom, just tell me. - [Lynn] Your Dad's been diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer and it doesn't look good. (Mike grunts) - All right, here are the rules. I want no tears. I want no sad faces. I want no phony happy faces either. I'm gonna call a press conference and tell everybody that I'm not just gonna lie down and let this happen to me. And I want life for the little ones to be as normal as possible, so you bigger kids, I want you to limit your visitations to weekends only. Okay? (somber music) - Breaker, breaker! I'm looking for help! I need alternative cancer cures! I desperately need a cure! Come back! Breaker! Breaker! I need medical advice! Is anybody out there? Come back! I need alternative cancer cures. I'm looking for any kind of hope. - [Man] You going to talk to me or you gonna let me sit out here and rot? - Jack - [Jack] I heard it on the news Mike. I put my ears on for old times sake and there you were. I'm so sorry man, what can I do? Over. - Tell me that I didn't lose the best friend that I've ever had. - [Jack] I'm here. - Tell me that I can find a cure before he dies. - God, how are ya? - [Mike] Good man. - You look great man. - It's good to see you! - Good to see you too. - [Mike] Okay. Yeah, no, I've got that, I've got that. Right, right. But does this particular drug work on the immune system? - [Man On Phone] Well, it's looking very very pleasant. - Okay good. - No, no, it's Adenocarcinoma. (cameras shuttering) Yeah, I don't know why they give the longest names to the diseases that give you the shortest amount of time to live. What it means is that I can't pretend that I have a hangnail. That's all. So I'm going in for traditional chemotherapy and whatever alternative medicine seem sensible. But hey, hey, as long as I can still do this. - [Reporter] Awe, that's great Mr. Landon. Well I guess I'm doing all right, huh? - Look at him, always putting on a show even when he should be resting. - [Reporter] Mr. Landon, one more time please. - Your Dad belongs to the world. Always has. - I'm losing my Father. - [Michael] That's enough, thanks. - And I haven't even really - Thanks for coming out. - [Mike] found him yet. - [Michael] Appreciate it. - Hey Mom. - Hi honey. - You got a second to talk? - Well of course. Come on in, sit down. Are you all right? - Tell me something about Dad that I don't know. Something that'll make all the pieces fit. - Oh Lord. Honey, your Dad's a very complicated man. - But why? Why did he leave us? - I don't know for sure, but, do you remember how you felt when you felt like your Dad failed us? How you fell apart? Imagine that happened to you at eight years old. Your Dad told me this story once. It was about his eighth birthday and he'd asked his Mom for weeks to have a party. So they sent out the invitations, they decorated the house, and an hour before the guests were supposed to arrive, she canceled it. She said she didn't like eight year old boys. She never celebrated him in that house ever again. He felt like he didn't exist. It nearly destroyed him, and I think the thing that hurt him the most was that he, he couldn't talk to his Father about it. - That's why he wrote all those shows about happy families. Because that's what he wished his childhood had been like. - Don't make the same mistake Michael. You talk to him. - I'm afraid to. I don't even know how to make him listen. - Maybe you could write him a letter. Try. (somber music) (rushing air) (metal clanking) (crowd shouting) - Dad? Dad! - [Michael] Thanks for coming out, I appreciate it! - Dad! Dad! Daddy! Dad, where are you! Dad! Daddy! Leave him alone! He's just a man! He's my Dad! (metal clanking) (ambient music) (solemn music) - [Woman] Hi Michael, we love your Father! (reporters talking) - [Man] Our prayers are with you! - [Man] God bless! - [Woman] Tell him to get well soon Michael! - [Man] He's gonna pull through! He can make it! Don't give up! - Hey Dad, I've been doing some research on my own. This drug is being used in Mexico with amazing results. - Everybody's got a cure. Son, do you have any idea how many people have written me this week? - No, I mean, I understand. - It's all right. Let's take a walk. Son, I appreciate you bringing the medicine. You gotta know, I got a medicine cabinet full of miracle cures from Mexico. It's not gonna work. Sit down. Come on, sit down. The light's pretty here isn't it? - [Mike] Yeah, it's nice. - It's my favorite spot. - You've lost more weight Dad. - Yeah. The tumor's grown to twice the size Son. It won't be long now. - Dad-- - Now look Son, I'm not afraid. You know, I'm not afraid to die Michael, I just don't wanna be kept alive on one of those stinking machines. I mean, it's my life, right? And I think I'm the best judge of when it's over and when it's not over. - Dad, there's something that I wanna tell ya. - What am I gonna do with the little kids? I got kids that are scared Mike. - Dad, there's something that I wanna tell you, okay? I don't know where to start. - Well maybe it's best that you didn't start Son, 'cause I'm not feeling so good out here after all. I'm gonna go on inside. - Dad, I have to say this! Now listen to me! - What is it Michael? - You were right. All along I wanted you to be miserable. But it's not because I didn't love you. 'Cause I love you more than anybody in this whole world. I just, I wanted you to realize that you made a mistake and come back to us. When I was a kid Dad, you were the best. You were the best. (solemn music) And I miss that. So I'm sorry. - Well I'm glad you got that off your chest. Son, I'm glad. Eye winker, Tommy tinker. Nose smeller, mouth eater, chin chomper. (Michael laughing) I'm, I'm a little tired. I'm gonna go upstairs. - Come here buddy. - Take a rest. Give me a hand up, would you Son? Hey. - [Mike] Here. - Those stairs are killer. It's deeper to breathe in. Listen, I'm real sorry about all this. - It's okay Dad. It's okay. Watch yourself. Watch your head. - Yeah. Damn it would you, would you close those blinds would ya Son? I'm really tired Michael. I think I'm gonna get some rest. Get a little sleep. Sleep. - I love you Dad. - I love you more. (Michael laughing) I got one! I got one! (kids laughing) All right, you and your Mom. Okay, you ready? Okay, let's race these guys. (Mike laughing) - [Mike] Not a round. - [Michael] Get a real job! For crying out loud, I'm a Dad! - [Mike] It's been years since my Father's passing. I know now that he loved me all along. But as I reflect on my own life and my Father's, I realize that the choices we make in life often twist our paths beyond our control. They cause us to be and do things we'd never accept if we could step outside of ourselves and see clearly. By finally allowing him to be just a man, with human frailties and limitations, as well as strengths and virtues, I was able to put aside blame, forgive us both, and get on with my life. - [Little Girl] Dad's home, Dad's home! Mom, Dad's home! (light upbeat music) (kids laughing) - Oh! What do ya know! Which one was here! - I missed you Daddy! - [Mike] Give me a kiss. Oh hi sweetie. (light gentle music)
