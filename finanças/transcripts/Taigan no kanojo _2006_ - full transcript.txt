You know, when will i be able to change our current situation? Mom! I want to go and play in the sandbox. Sure, go ahead and play. Here, take this. Thank you. I'm sorry. Sorry. Akari, what are you doing here? Behave, and have fun with them, alright? I'm really sorry. Akari, shall we go to the supermarket? Akari is just like me. Is that so? Yeah, about finding a job... Yes? What about Akari? We can send her to daycare. I've thought about this a lot. Even though it's sad to send her to daycare, Even though it's sad to send her to daycare I believe it's good for her to interact with kids her age. Even now... What kind of job is it? It's listed as a cleaning position. Laundry? No, it's a travel agency. I don't understand. "Platinum Star Planet Company". Sorry to disturb you. Wait a moment. You've waited long enough. Are you Miss. Tamura? Yes, that's me. I spoke to the manager about you. Oh, I'm the manager. Yes. We seem to be alumni. Really? We graduated from the same university, in the same year. I'm Narahashi Aoi. I'm Sayoko Tamura. Nice to meet you. Welcome. Aoi, wake up! Dad, didn't you have the night shift? Um, I wanted to see you off. No need. Come on, I've been waiting up all night. On the first day of school, you should see her off It's okay, even if I'm late, no one will bully me. This time, I'm going to a proper all-girls school. There won't be any bullying like before. I was just joking. Are you leaving now? What's this? I wanted to try a different style. Is it strange? Get in the car. I'm leaving. Good morning. Morning, hello. Morning. Morning. I'm Aoi Narahashi, nice to meet you. Let's give her a round of applause, welcome! You sit in the back. Alright. Hey, hey, hey! Aoi, why did you change back? What do you mean? When you first came, your skirt was shorter. I'm Yuko Noguchi, the child of Noguchi and Nanako. Nanako? Did you go to the newly opened shop in front of the station? Yeah, but there's nothing good there. There's a donut shop next door. Oh, great! Let's go check it out together one day. Just hang out around there. Get on the bus. I'm Sayoko Tamura, plea... Hurry up and get on. Good morning. Nice clothes. Is it strange? These clothes don't mind getting dirty. They fit well. Then they won't look good. I'm Nakazato. Looking for gloves? Stop searching. There's nothing like that. When cleaning, your hands are the most reliable tools. If there's any dirt, you can tell by touching. Everything's clean and slippery to the touch. You wouldn't know if you wear gloves. Work and listen at the same time, don't just stand there. Okay. Don't rush to drain the water, we still need it. Use this water to wash whatever you can first. Got it. So dirty. What's all this about? Don't make a big deal out of it. Tired? Hey, how about some beer? No thanks. Right, Nakazato knows we should be upset. I want curry. Okay. Is that person not from our company? No, she's not. I'm currently collaborating with her company. We met at a gathering, or you could call it a cocktail party. Now, running a small travel agency is quite difficult. That's why we're planning to expand into the cleaning business. Food's ready. Some people want someone to clean their house while they're on vacation. I think it's a good idea. Having someone clean the house when we're away, that's nice. Nakazato can only help until the end of next month. After that, we have to find clients ourselves. Understood, right? understood. Thank you. Are you regretting it now? No, not at all. To be honest, I do have some regrets. You don't seem like it. Well, stop using formal language with me. Okay. We're about the same age. Hey, does this remind you of the college cafeteria? Which one does it remind you of? The new one or the old one? The old cafeteria, right? Yeah, remember the marinated tuna rice bowl? It was 580 yuan per serving. Back then, I thought it was so expensive. The curry rice was like 170 yuan. Yeah, the meatless curry. Are you free today? Why? I'm thinking of throwing a welcome party. I have some stuff to take care of. Can't make it then? Yeah. The kids are being looked after by your mother-in-law, right? Your mother-in-law, huh? Her Is she annoying? It's not just about her being annoying. She always likes to taunt people. Taunt people? And you just bear with it? Yeah, I can't argue back either. You know I love cream, right? Yeah, I know. You do? It's delicious. Did you used to live in Yokohama? Yes. In an apartment building? Yes, an apartment building. Apartment, huh? Which floor do you live on? The fifth floor. How did you do on the math test? What? Every time I talk to you, you always reply with, "What?" I just got two points. I asked Shanyejing how she did, but she won't say. She claims no one could have scored lower than her. Two points are already low enough. I'm so sad, I'm so dumb. Aoi. Aoi. Are you catching the bus? Aoi, you run really fast. Where are you getting off? what? Here you go again. I'm getting off at Hiraicho. Can I come and play? what? Here you go again. Wow, Kelbis! It's so quiet here. Next time, I'll take you to a secret base. I am leaving. See you tomorrow. see you tomorrow. Isn't it a bit too late? Is it not okay? I've been making excuses several times before. It's not good to keep refusing. Okay, then. I can't just stay home every weekend. Thanks a lot. Please don't force me into this every week. What do you mean? I'm just kidding. Hasegawa, it seems you haven't really eaten fish before. My family used to run a meat shop. Don't make excuses. How about going to another place then? I don't feel like it. Maybe in ten years. Thanks for today. See you tomorrow. Let's go. Is it in the same direction? What? If you don't have anything to do, come to my place later. Won't you go? Then I'll go. Sure. Please give me the receipt. Thank you. This is it. My place is quite messy. Come in. Sorry to disturb you. You must be surprised too. Everyone who visits is shocked. Is this the manager's place? Looks like the company is about to go bankrupt. But... Pull that open and take a look. It's amazing! I rented this place just for this. Sit wherever you like. Boss, boss, everyone says that in the cleaning department, Tamura is the real boss. Am I being annoying? No, not at all. You work so hard, and from your perspective, I must seem carefree. But sometimes, I can't help feeling... It's nothing. I don't think that way. Aren't housewives always happy and oblivious to hardships? When I was younger, I always thought that growing up would bring about changes. I thought I would mature, naturally socialize with people, have a harmonious family, and good friends. In short, I believed I could do better. My daughter is just like my miniature. It's been over a month since she started going to daycare, but still haven't made any friends. Why don't you think about living on your own? Even if you're alone, you shouldn't be afraid as long as you can have what you want. That's what a friend once told me. However, not being lonely without having a relationship with a man is just nonsense. It's so quiet here. What? If there's something I need to do, can I bring my child here? Sure, no problem. We can sleep together. But this place is too small. It's better to go to a hot spring resort. An open-air hot spring. Hot spring? I haven't been to one in years. Then let's go. I'm serious. That's not the way to wipe; you have to pat. If you don't press the dirt onto the surface, you can't remove the stains. My back isn't good... Don't make excuses. Wait a moment. It's all used up; why isn't it working? Oh my goodness, you have to dilute it first. How come you haven't figured it out yet? It's been a while. There are still stains here. There's nothing I can do. I'm not making excuses. My back is really hurting. Close your eyes. what? Is it your eyes? I told you to close your eyes. I can't understand what you're saying. Thank you. I'm so tired. How did a good travel agency end up doing this? Oh, it's getting dark. I didn't say clearly what I wanted you to do. Our boss is really easy-going. Tamura, you may not know but Aoi is quite a remarkable person. Are you referring to her being capable? No, I mean she has an extraordinary past. I heard it was even covered in the newspapers. Aoi.. Received... Nanako. Hello, Aoi. What did you have for dinner last night? There was no one at home, so I didn't want to cook. I had some snacks, Lotte bear-shaped cookies. They're my favorite these days. See you later. Nanako Nanako received . Aoi sent. I'll be waiting for you at the usual place today. I'll bring some fresh olives and the "Hokuto no Ken" manga. Could you bring some donuts when you come? Okay then, see you later. Aoi up. Cinnamon cocoa and vanilla ice cream pancakes. Seafood pizza from Ski. Sazaby backpack. If you say that, then I want a dress from Flandre If we keep going like this, it'll become a competition. Let's just say what we like. Okay, let's start over. David Bowie. Sano Motoharu. Sano Motoharu is good enough. Saza is nice too. Yes, I like it too. I wonder if they will come to Sumagoi. Sumagoi isn't far from here, right? Aoi, you really don't know. Sumagoi is quite far away. City people always think that everything in the countryside is so close by. Sumagoi is quite far away. Maebashi and Takasaki are far too. Tokyo is even further. Hey, let's go to that secret base I mentioned earlier. Nanako, where are you going? me? Since kindergarten, I have always... always been bullied and had no friends. During junior high, I couldn't even go to school because I was afraid. I also realized that I was a bit weird, But no one told me how to be like a normal person. Aoi, you've always been bullied. Surely it's because others are jealous of you, as you have many things they don't. Please don't say comforting words. know it's because I'm weird. I'm quite grateful to those who bullied me because they led me to meet you. Nanako... Have you never been disliked by anyone? Never fought with siblings? Your mom is especially gentle. You've lived a happy life. I have nothing to fear. If you're ever excluded in the future, I will still be your friend. I'll protect you. Nanako, you're really strong. I'm not afraid of any of these things. Really, I'm not afraid at all. Because there's nothing important to me in those things. Do you know the story of the silver ring? What is it? Whoever can receive a silver ring on their 19th birthday will be happy for a lifetime. It must be given by a boyfriend, right? Aoi, if you don't have a boyfriend when you turn 19, I'll give you the ring. I'm sure I'll have a boyfriend to give me one. See you tomorrow. Look at this, what do you think? This one is for housewives. And this one is for singles. I think it's good. Then I'll print it out and take a look. Is today okay? what? Isn't it your mother-in-law's birthday today? It's fine. Work is more important. If we finish it today, we can send it to the printing factory on Monday. Adult beverages, huh? Hard work, hard work. Why are you back so soon? Is Mom okay? What's the use of me going alone? Weren't you supposed to work overtime? I'm working overtime at home. Excuse me. This is the Nara Bridge that takes good care of me on weekdays. That's right. Please take care of me. We're making flyers. We'll start distributing them next month. Great. Then I'll leave. It's okay, just keep working on it. Good morning. You're awake. Everything's fine. I really want to go to a hot spring one day. Me too. I'm leaving. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Here I am. Did you hear? Hear what? Naguchi's family is extremely poor. It seems they eat wild grass every day as their meal. Let's go. Let's go. What's wrong? Um, don't meet like this secretly all the time. Why? I…… But if we keep doing this, even you might face exclusion. It's okay; let's continue like this. I've said it before; I don't care about what others say. They can say whatever they want. You pretend not to see me at school too. Let's go. In my opinion, the people at school are just bored and have nothing better to do, so they create these "caste" divisions for no reason. They discriminate against the "lower class" to feel superior. Sigh. Hmm. Take me to your house. Don't go. why? There's nothing interesting in my house. But you have been to my house so many times, and you've seen everything. okay then Come in. What would you like to drink? One more room than everyone said, satisfied now? You've seen the legendary slum. As I said, I don't care at all. People gossiping about me doesn't bother me, It's those people who have problems My younger sister is the one who looks like an ugly duckling. That's my sister. We're responsible for cleaning on behalf of others. Get it? Hello. We, Platinum Planet Company, are promoting our cleaning services for others. We're currently doing promotional activities. No need. We all know that business is not doing well now. Even though there's no need to rush, we don't have any cleaning contracts at the moment, which is not good. I still suggest downsizing as continuing like this may pose greater risks. I'm back. Hard work. What about the travel service for the elderly that we discussed earlier? Hasegawa, that project is still a blank canvas. Completely blank. Oh, it's already 5 o'clock. Let's discuss it elsewhere. Maybe not, we'll end up drinking again, and the meeting will turn into a nonsensical mess. But sitting here with long faces won't solve anything either. Let's change the location. What should we discuss next? There are too many issues. Yes, we can't continue the discussion without having some drinks. Alright, let's go. My treat. Are you coming too? I have a tight schedule. Oh, right, you have to pick up your child. If there's anything, I'll call you later. See you tomorrow. Mom, I want to go out and play. Akari, don't be naughty. No, I want to go out. I want to go out to play Mom is cooking. You should eat at home. Akari, can you go and watch TV? I don't want to. Akari, stop it. Akari, Mom is really angry. Sit down. What's wrong? She doesn't listen to anything I say. Akari, go watch TV. If it's too difficult, then just quit. What do you mean "difficult," what do you mean "quit"? Being a cleaning lady. Lately, the atmosphere at home hasn't been good. You're always getting angry. Why do you do such a strenuous job? Last time, your boss came to our house, right? Even on a Sunday, She came to work here. I feel like this boss isn't right for you. I'm not saying that working outside is bad, but can't you find a job that's less demanding and more meaningful? Are you saying my current job is meaningless? Okay or not, Mom? No, absolutely not. Why? Other people are also working. We're just worried about you. It's not like I'm going alone. I'll be with children from decent families. That makes me even more worried. why? Why do you talk like that, Nanako? I heard…… Everything is gained through experience. Working at the guesthouse is a good opportunity. Just remember to check in with us every night. Nanako, is there anyone there? I'll take you around later. I've prepared a kids' room for both of you. Is it okay for you two to share? We'll get to work soon. There's plenty to do. Since you're here, you'll have to follow our orders. Please take care of us. Hey, what are you doing? Watch carefully and hit it hard. you try. You try too. Are you two twins? Do we look alike? I didn't notice. You big kids all look alike. Call me when it's dried. There's more work waiting. Okay. Hurry up. Yes. No, the sashimi should go on the right. Yes. Nanako, don't be lazy. Sweep the floor quickly. Now, you're in charge of sweeping, and I'll read manga. Get to it quickly. Let's play games. No. 8 Kokusho Sayuri No. 5, Nakazawa. No. 11, Kawai Maruko. It's Fukunaga Rimi Welcome. Hello, welcome. Nanako, it's delicious. Stop being picky. Sister, you seem like my mom. Look, Shinzouke ate it all. If you don't like it, then just say so. You're acting like a kid. Welcome. Please register here. Please fill in your personal information. Aoi.. I really wish I was born in this place. Me too. Having the sea is wonderful. Sometimes I get worried about many things, but after coming here, I realized that looking at the sea makes me feel much better, no matter what troubles I have. You've done much better than you think. Thank you for taking care of us. We'll come back next year. School will start next week. It's unbelievable. We must come back next year. The bus is here. Nanako. Nakako we have to wait an hour for the next bus. Nanako, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell? Or did you lose something? Aoi... I... I don't want to go back. I don't want to either... ...Don't want to go back I don't want to go back. Don't want to go back. Don't want to go back. Don't want to go back. Alright, We won't go back. Akari. Keep going. Boss. Aoi, I just went to the area around Kichijoji Temple I heard you were here, so I came by. By the way Do you want to watch the sports event while you're here? I just found out this morning. What about those few companies you talked about before? They all accepted. We received a call this morning, specifically asking us to handle it. That's fantastic! Absolutely, it's fantastic! Aoi, are we doing something meaningless? We wouldn't do something without meaning. Though I'm not good at socializing, I am capable of getting things done, right? What are you saying? From the beginning, when we had nothing, to now securing the contract, if we didn't have a boss, how could we have achieved it? Aoi, being with you makes me feel like I can accomplish anything. Ugh, you're exaggerating too much. There's a performance later, do you want to come and watch? Really? Nonoko What's up? Being with you makes me feel like I can accomplish anything. We can achieve anything together. This one is better than the previous one. Are you talking about "Love Queen"? The food there is so bad I could puke. I'll go get some drinks. No rush, someone will definitely treat us to drinks later. Hey, come over and dance for a while. Always eating will make you as fat as a pig. Fake prude. Goodbye. Hey, are you going to the hot spring we talked about earlier? Wishing us a smooth first deal and a successful opening. When? Right now. Now? Tomorrow is Sunday. It's only 2 o'clock now, and we can't go anywhere yet. But it's better to go somewhere nearby. Hey, how about Atami? I know a good place in Atami. Going to see the sea, eat good food, and soak in the hot spring, how does that sound? I also want to go tomorrow, right? Then let's go. Well, that's decided then. It's like a dream come true. what? Being able to come here. It's not like going abroad. It's only 2,000 yuan from here to Tokyo. I remember when I was in high school, I hate going home after school and would linger at the seaside until it got dark. Because if I went home, soon it would be tomorrow again. I didn't want to go home. Did you used to live by the seaside? Yes. Have you also lived by the seaside? The sea has a purifying effect. Then let's live by the seaside when we get old. Every day we can watch the sea while drinking tea. Sure, that's what I've been thinking too. Oh no, we're running out of money. How much is left? 192,875 yuan. Still quite a bit. Look, we're currently spending an average of 10,000 yuan a day. So, with this money, we can last for nineteen days. If something unexpected happens, we won't be able to go anywhere else. Thank you for waiting. That girl? Yes. Thank you for your hard work. What are you guys up to? Just borrowing some money to spend. Give me a little more, please. I'm sorry, this is all I have. Take it. She, don't remember me at all, did she ? When I used to live here before, not only she bullied me, but everyone else did the same. I want to see where you used to live. You lived here all along? Since elementary school. Do you want some candy? There's something I've been wanting to ask you. Your name is "Uoko" Then it is call "Nanako Oh, that, it's the name of a fabric. Our town's textile and fabrics are quite famous, you know. I heard "Nanako" is a name for a pretty high-quality fabric. My grandmother gave me this name. She passed away when I was in elementary school. My family used to have five members, but later, when my grandmother got cancer and was hospitalized, nobody in the family felt sad. Everyone cheerfully divided up the house. They cleared out my grandmother's wardrobe, homemade wine, rice bran sauce, and everything But I have no right to criticize them. I never went to the hospital to see her. When she died, I even felt relieved. I realized what a heartless person I was back then. Aoi, you must be tired. Do you want to go home? I don't want to go back, but I do feel tired. I'm tired too. Ah, it's so cold. We need to book a hotel quickly. Today, let's enjoy a nice hot spring bath. we'll go to Hamamatsu to eat fish. At night, we'll have chicken wings and beer in Nagoya. mom I want to go home. Come on, Akari Don't leave, Aoi. We still have plans in Osaka. Aoi if you haven't booked a hotel yet, let's go back. Let's eat something delicious nearby and head back. Why? I have the accommodation expenses ready. It's not because of that. She didn't bring any spare clothes. She might get fussy sleeping in an unfamiliar place. It's okay I don't mind. If she needs clothes, we can buy some here. Aoi we're not high schoolers goofing around by the beach anymore Avoiding things won't solve anything. Avoiding? Actually, I just wanted to make my husband worry by staying out late at night. But running away like this won't solve anything either. I feel like as long as I'm with you, we can go anywhere. If we keep going like this... Did someone say something to you? what? What do you think I'd do to you? Where's Dad? Aoi, once you start a family, you'll understand. Things can get complicated if not planned in advance. And besides, there's this child to consider. Yeah, I didn't think it through when you called me here. My bad. Since no one is waiting for me back home, I wanted to have some fun. Um... Hello? Is this Hasegawa? Yes, it's me. Are you free? It's quite sudden, but are you coming to Atami? Originally, I planned to go with a friend, but she's not going anymore. It's such a rare chance for me to come here, and it'll be boring to go back just like that. If you can't make it, I'll find someone else. Sure, I can come. I'll wait for you. Call me when you're close. Alright then, talk to you later. Did you forget to bring money for the train ticket? Should I give you some? No need, thanks. Okay then, goodbye. Aoi. Hmm? It feels like we won't be able to go anywhere at this rate. I wanted to go to even farther places. Farther places, huh... How about this? Let's hold hands and fly from here together. Aoi, Aoi! Do you have any favorite celebrities? Not really. Don't you watch variety shows? Not much. I watch them every week. (Two high school girls, an abnormal sexual relationship failed double suicide attempt by jumping off a building) Aoi, your grandmother is here. She brought you some cake. Come to the ward to eat it. The doctor said you shouldn't wander around. I mean, what the company is doing seems to violate the contract, right? I was hired as an office worker. Always speaking in euphemisms... She keeps saying that considering the client's interests is essential, but sometimes I feel like I can't keep up with her pace. I'm not a volunteer here. Aoi, where did she go today? Went to the cultural center in Shibuya. She's so confused herself, how can she teach others anything? Boss, even though you obediently follow her arrangements, don't you find this place strange? Well, at least she still has a family if her cleaning business goes downhill. I'm currently doing my best to avoid any issues. You don't think... You have been invited by boss? to travel with her or go to her place? What are you trying to imply? It appears that Aoi might have certain inclinations or interests in that area. That's a bit too much She seems to have a preference for relationships with women. Tonight, I'll cook something delicious for you. But is it better to eat at home? Aoi... You... Where did Nanako go? Aoi... Good morning. Good timing. So, where are the others? Something happened. The cleaning business might have to stop for a while. I'm thinking of having you switch to work on this side, at the travel agency. What's going on? Has there been a rebellion? It's not an actual rebellion, it's just that they all resigned. They won't do cleaning anymore. So the existing cleaning business will be handed over to Nakazato, and we won't do any promotions either. I was thinking, maybe you could take over the finance position. That's easier said than done. I just changed positions; it will take some time to adapt. What are you thinking about? I don't know. It's just too sudden. True, But I won't force you to work overtime. . It's okay if you bring your child to work. Think about it. Starting work again? After that incident, how have things been between you two? What? Which incident? After the attempted suicide. Did your friend die? Ugh, boss, how did you find out about it? Who told you? Is it true that they say I'm gay? I read about it before. Back then, I was a bit envious of you. The girl didn't die. So, how is she doing now? I have no idea where she is now. I used to have a close friend too. But when I entered college, she said to me, "Why haven't you made new friends yet?" I can understand how your friend feels. Today, there's no cleaning job. You can go back. About what I just told you, give me an answer as soon as possible. Then, I'll go back now. If the cleaning job is canceled, I'll quit as well. Hey, are you available? It's quite sudden, but do you want to go to a hot spring? It's alright, go ahead. I'll treat you. Aoi Dad, why did you remove all those decorations? Well, your mom said they didn't look good, so she asked me to take them down. But the passengers actually liked them. I also think it looks better without them. Those things were just tacky. Really? Tacky indeed. Yeah. Yeah. Aoi, let me take you to Isezaki. Your birthday is coming up, and there are many shopping malls in Isezaki. Hmm. Anything you want, I'll buy it for you, like plush toys or clothes. dad I don't really want anything. I'm sorry, Dad. I need to take a nap soon. I have to drive all night tonight. Wait until tomorrow morning. You can find me at the Shiwhisker Shrine. Why? What for? Well, I'll bring Noguchi with me. what? Dad, how do you know? Where is the Nanako? If your mom finds out about this, She won't forgive me. Aoi, you look pretty good. I never thought wrestling could be so fun. It's so beautiful. This scenery only happens at this time every day. I didn't know. I'm transferring schools. All because of that incident. No, there's something going on at home, and I have to go live with a relative. Is it far? Not that far, my hometown is in Gunma Prefecture. Will we still be able to meet? Of course, I'm not going to space or anything. We were a bit foolish before, weren't we? In the end, we didn't go anywhere. Where did we plan to go back then? Hey, about your 19th birthday... I heard platinum is more durable than silver, so I plan to give you a platinum ring. That way, you'll be happier. Then I'll give you a platinum ring too. Don't you think the river looks like the sky? Clouds flow beneath our feet, giving a sense of not knowing where we are. see you tomorrow. Don't be too sad. It won't be long before you can meet again. dad... Why do we have no choice in anything? Does growing up mean we can make our own choices? You should start preparing for the exams. I want to attend Third Elementary School near my house. I get scared seeing kids coming out of daycare. Yeah, there are many rude kids there. Tamura, I think you did the right thing what by having Akari leave the daycare. Otherwise, she'd be easily influenced, right? right My kids soon started to learn from them Swear words Yup How is Lianjun I won't let you go to the nursery school. Are you lonely?
