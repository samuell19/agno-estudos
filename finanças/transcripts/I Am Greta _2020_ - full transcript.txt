(WIND BLOWING, WAVES LAPPING) (SAILBOAT CREAKING) GRETA THUNBERG: I think that actually everything I've experienced over these last few months... is like being in a dream... ...or in a movie. But a very bad movie, because that movie would be very unrealistic. MAN 1: It's fashionable these days to blame everything on global warming. Particularly on man-made global warming. But I'm afraid the evidence doesn't point in that direction. MAN 2: A little bit of warming would not be a bad thing for myself, being a Canadian and the people in Russia wouldn't mind a little... A couple of degrees warmer either. MAN 3: All of this with the global warming, a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax, I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay. It's a hoax. MAN 4: The whole "climate crisis" as they call it, is not only fake news, it's fake science. There is no climate crisis. There is nothing to be afraid of. MAN 5: How much warming will you get if you, let us say, double the CO2 in the air? The answer is, you don't get very much. MAN 6: The problem is not global warming. The problem is that we keep hearing one-sided arguments. MAN 7: Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the environment, to agriculture and forestry, and to the climate of the earth. MAN 8: There are some people who are so arrogant to think that they are so powerful, they can change climate. Man can't change climate. GRETA: Adults always say one thing and then do something completely different. They say that we only have one planet, and we should take care of it. And yet no one gives a damn about the climate crisis. My name is Greta Thunberg, and I am 15 years old. I am on a school strike for the climate in front of the Parliament, until the election day. ♪ GRETA: Many have heard about climate change and know vaguely what it means with rising sea levels, increased average temperatures, and so on. But no one seems to fully understand the consequences. That we are right now living as if we had several Earths. Sometimes it feels like we who have Asperger's or autism are the only ones who see through the noise. ♪ I am protesting about the climate crisis because it's such an important issue. What we are doing now, future generations can't change. And no one is doing anything, nothing is happening. So I must do what I can. WOMAN: What did you think when you first heard her talking about the idea to start protesting? SVANTE: I told her if she would do that, I would not support it. So she made a very long list of facts that she's been handing out to people. And, uh, she knows the climate issue, I would say better than 97% of all the politicians, probably in the world. She has almost a photographic memory when it comes to things she's interested in. So she can read books and almost remember everything that's in there. WOMAN: Did you expect something like that? SVANTE: (CHUCKLES) I didn't expect anything. I just wanted her to be happy. And I'm very sure that she didn't expect anything either. I mean, she just... She felt she had to do something and she had to do it completely on her own. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) GRETA: I don't like making small talk with people or socializing. Sometimes, I go quiet and can stay so for hours only because I simply can't talk. I like to have routines, and I notice details. And once I really get interested in something, I can get, like, laser focused on it and keep doing it for hours, without getting bored. We saw a film in school. There were starving polar bears, floodings, hurricanes and droughts. And the scientists said that we didn't have much time left to change our behavior. That was when I started getting depressed. And got anxiety. And stopped eating and stopped talking. I was sick. I almost starved to death. It took many years but slowly. I started to feel better. ♪ I felt that, why should I give up when there were so many different things you could do to make a difference? "I love seeing someone who doesn't just complain. "But gets out and does something about it. You inspire me." GRETA: My name is Greta Thunberg and I am 15 years old. And we have had school strikes for the climate for three weeks. But we will go on with the school strike every Friday. As from now, we will sit outside the Swedish Parliament until Sweden is in line with the Paris Agreement. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is needed. Please join in. (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE DISCONNECTS) GRETA: Once the climate crisis has gotten your attention, you can't look away.

My parents got very surprised and they wondered why I did like that. And I explained, to save energy. GRETA: My family lived a very high-consuming lifestyle. We bought lots of things, we ate meat.

"There are lots of things being done. You don't need to worry." But that was exactly what made me so afraid. That people seemed to think that we were making progress.

Please, Greta, you have the floor. For 25 years, countless people have stood in front of the United Nations Climate Conferences asking our nations' leaders to stop the emissions. But clearly, this has not worked, since the emissions just continue to rise. So I will not ask them anything. Instead, I will ask the people around the world to realize that our political leaders have failed us. Because we are facing an existential threat. And there's no time to continue down this road of madness. We have come here to let them know that change is coming whether they like it or not. The people will rise to the challenge.

No, no, that's right, but everybody's doing great jobs locally in every country. But you're, like, that girl that started it all, you know? GIRL: I think we needed this kind of story that you told.
