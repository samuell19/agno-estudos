Don't you just love these long rainy afternoons in New Orleans when an hour isn't just an hour but a little piece of eternity dropped into your hands and who knows what to do with it? You, er, didn't get wet in the rain? Perhaps you stepped inside the drugstore. I just don't think it's the kind of thing our children should be exposed to. As teachers we should protect our children from many things. Great art isn't one of them. Now sit down. You're embarrassing your daughter. Come on. Stella! Stella! She ain't coming down. So you quit. Stella! I've been on to you from the start. Not once did you pull any wool over this boy's eyes. You come in here and sprinkle the place with powder... What you are talking about is brutal desire. Just Desire. The name of that rattle-trap streetcar that bangs through the Quarter, up one old narrow street and down another. We've seen quite enough. Oh! How is it for you, Mrs Griffiths, huh, living in blissful ignorance? Is it better or worse than quiet desperation? I don't want realism. I want magic. Goodnight, mother. Yes, magic. I try to give that to people. Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers. What was that for? I'm really nervous. Focus. Breathe. Mean what you say. Have you had enough now? Come on then. The sets are looking lovely, David. Oh, thank you, Mrs Jones. We're proud of those. And when you finally get around to building my extension, I expect the same high standards. Well, I'm not going to make any promises but, for you, I'll try my very best. All right? You must be so busy, Mayor Jenkins. Ohhh! It's fantastic. Fair play to you to take the time to come and encourage the children. Wasn't she the best thing in it? Oh, definitely. You look dead on your feet. I am, Mam. Oppressing people is hard work. We'll head home shortly. Mm! Mm!-mm! Can we go home soon? Yes, I said we will. OK. We'll go home shortly. Mr Morgan. I'll see you again. Bye-bye now. Mr Morgan, did you enjoy the show? Oh, very much, yes. Who was the boy who played Caiaphas the high priest? Oh, that's Nick. He was a real handful when he first came to the club. He's had a real tough time of it. You know, his dad, he was in jail for burglary. Yeah. And his mum likes her drink. But he never missed a rehearsal. I'm sure you'd have liked something a bit grittier than Lloyd Webber. I don't want realism. I want magic. Hm? I remember that line from Streetcar. Yeah. I remember you putting Vivien Leigh to shame. Stop it. Well... You come for dinner one night. I'd like that. Would you? Do you know, I was watching the faces of the children when they were performing. They were transported. Huh? They believe in magic. It was fabulous, wasn't it? Oh, here's David now. Hiya, Mr Morgan. Are you all right? Yeah, grand. I was just telling your wife, - she should be very proud of herself. - Yeah. Anyway. I'll be off. See you both soon, all right? Nos da. Nos da. I'll push off. I've got to be at work in four hours. I know but... Mark! Oh! Hi, Mr Morgan. That was wonderful, wasn't it, eh? Oh, thank you. Did you enjoy it? Oi! I enjoyed every... Jesus! Oh! Your mam's calling you. All right. Good to see you, Mr Morgan. Peace be with you. You can drop the Stanislavski method now. Mm-hm! What are you drinking, Mam? Can I have one? Nom you bloody well can't, it's mine! I'm not being funny but you nearly gave Lil a coronary. What? Well, in the interval, she saw Jesus with his tongue down Mary Magdalene's throat outside the Co-op. I doubt she'll ever recover from that one. I wasn't... I wasn't. It wasn't, Mam. Who was it then? It was Gwyneth Jones. Oh. That's all right then. But not in the Jesus costume, eh? All right, Mam. I'll see you at home. Ta-ra! Do you know, I thought the kids were brilliant last night. Oh, I know. So, what are you going to put on next? Give me a break. I'm still knackered from this one. But I have been thinking, you know, about challenging them just a little bit more. Midsummer Night's Dream. Mm! Not that one. Way too scary. It's not scary. It is when you watch it on acid. Found that out on a school trip. I thought it would be fun, instead it scared the life out of me. Since that day, I've never watched Shakespeare again. Wouldn't it make more sense to never do acid again? No. Oh! Carol. Just give it a trim. Nothing fancy. I'll be back in an hour. But... Take a seat, love. Don't need to be scared. Go for it. So, what do you really want? You! Morning, Susan. Good morning, Mayor. Can I get a coffee, please? Hiya. That'll be Â£5, please, Mrs Pritchard. Cup of tea or coffee? I'm fine, thank you. Susan Leonard? We were at school together. I was in the year below you. I remember you were one of the really clever ones. Didn't you go to Oxford? Cambridge, actually. I was completely useless at school. Bottom of every class. It wasn't until I was 17, they realised I was hopelessly dyslexic. So, you decided to become a postman? Odd choice I know. People still wonder how Mrs Williams found out her husband was having an affair with the next door neighbour. No. Didn't you get engaged to David Llewellyn? I did, yes. I remember thinking he was a lovely boy. Yeah, I thought so too. Until I caught him shagging my best friend from uni. Ready now. Coming. Richard Good ridge. Oh, Richard Good ridge! Hello, Mayor. Hey! Good to have you with us. Thank you. I knew your father, of course. I remember him telling me you were studying Welsh history. That's right, yes. For the last seven years now at the Open University. This just came in. My plan is to become a teacher. I almost had my qualification, then, you know, my father had his heart attack. Oh! Oh, yeah. It was a terrible shock to all of us. Thank you. He loved this town. Before he died, he made me promise that I would finish off his hard work he started setting up an adult education centre. Oh! Emlyn had been banging on about that for years. Said that in this changing world people need the chance to retrain for new careers. Absolutely, yeah. I have a couple... Richard, Richard, Richard. Are you listening, son? The trick to getting things done around here is to build alliances. Huh? Do you have any plans for Saturday afternoon? Er, no plans, no. We're having a few people over for drinks at the golf club. Very informal. Right. But all the councillors will be there and you'll be able to start to get them onside. Oh, lovely. Thank you. I look forward to it. Ahh! Martyn, sorry to keep you. Yeah, how are you? Eh? I just walked in. Hey! Hey! Thanks for the gift. Oh! Now, this is where I want to build the new shopping centre. Right. Next to the Lyric. No. On the site of the Lyric, after we demolish it. Er... ...but the place is still being used as a cinema. Yeah, showing films nobody wants to see. When was the last time you were there? I saw the Youth Opera there last night with my daughter. But their shows are only every few months. You're right. I haven't seen a film there in ages. Precisely. They'll be bankrupt in a year. Ha! And you will be stuck with a ruin in the middle of town instead of a vibrant commercial centre that will turn Carmarthen into a destination location. And what's good for Carmarthen is good for you. If we can do this, your share options will go through the roof. Hm! You'll be able to retire early and live like a king. Yeah. You do know it's a listed building. Well, you can fix that for a fee. Yeah. Yeah. The place is falling apart. It might even be a danger to anyone inside. You're right. Ah, it's had its day. Yeah. So, you'll sort out the zoning and planning permissions, hmm? Yeah. I'll get out my chequebook. Yeah. Yeah. Morning, Dolly. I have to ask you to keep your voice down, Liz. I'm hanging. Go and have a kip. You'll be fine. You're a life saver. Thank you. Susan. Oh! It's been forever. Oh, I know. I'm sorry. I'm in a bit of a rush. Could you just do a quick trim? Yeah. Thank you. Your mam was in last week. She's worried you're going to move to the other side of the world. I applied for a job in Cardiff. It's an hour away. And I doubt I'll even get it. You know, I've always wanted a career in politics. I thought being the mayor's "executive assistant" would be a good first step. Turns out our mayor thinks a woman, even one with a law degree, is only capable of filing and answering phones. Well, you know, he always was a bit odd. That's because he feels threatened by women. Probably because he realises we should be the ones running the world. We couldn't do a worse job than them, could we? No! Going anywhere special? I wish. The mayor's invited me to drinks at the golf club. I'm only going because Ceri's my best friend. God knows why she married him. Sorry. That was a bit harsh. But true. Richard, you made it. Welcome. Come here, come here, come here. This is my wife Ceri. Ceri, this is Richard, the newest addition to the town council. And our postman, if I'm not mistaken. Thank you. Don't be soft. There's a few people I want you to meet. Nearly all the other councillors are here. Oh, from Alwyn. Hello. Nice. Nice. Come on. You know what I'm like about religion. Give me your glass. The way her face lit up on that Lyric stage, I bloody nearly converted on the spot. This is Darek. He's Carmarthen's answer to Leon Trotsky, only more left wing. I want you to meet our newest councillor, Richard Good ridge. How's it going? All right. Oh! Emlyn's boy. Ah! You knew my dad? Aye, aye, aye. He spoke about you often. Come on, you, let's go. Ha! Right. Enjoy yourself. And on the nationalist end of the spectrum, this is Aled. He's a firm advocate of the watchtowers and razor wires along the border, aren't you, eh? Don't forget the machine guns. I won't. Welcome to Carmarthen's corridors of power. Ah! (SPEAKS WELSH Thanks. Come on. I want to introduce Richard to the councillors who aren't on the lunatic fringe. Come on. I think the feeling is he's insane. Yeah. I know, I know. Oh! Oh, my God! I wasn't, er... - Yeah, you were. It's fine. - Come on. Oh! Is she... single? Yeah, I think so. OK. The last office Christmas party, I had a few too many. I had a crack but she was having none of it. Huh! So I think she might be a lesbian. Oh, God! Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to a good friend of mine. Yeah. And you're going to help yourself to some nibbles. You OK? Absolutely, yeah. Nice. Thank you. All right. Off you go. Go on, go on, go on. You were all brilliant in Jesus Christ Superstar. Anyone got any ideas about what we put on next? Mam, you always do this. You ask us to vote, then we vote, then you overrule us, OK? Stop pretending this is a democracy - because it's a dictatorship. - I'm right. A benevolent dictatorship. Mam, we don't care. We already know what we're doing next, so just tell us. Yeah, tell us. It's exciting this, isn't it? The next production that we're going to put on at the Lyric is going to be... Mam! ...Oliver. Auditions start on Monday. He's the swing vote on this. I know. I've done the numbers. You'd better keep him close. Did I leave my bag down here? Hiya. Oh, hiya. Thank you. I love what you've done with your hair. It... It looks gorgeous. Thank you. Darek tells me you have got a master's in history from the Open University. That's very impressive. Well, thank you very much. Medieval is my real passion. But I love it all really. Do you know...? Richard. Sorry. Can I drag you away for a minute? I have to get going anyway. But, um, I'd love to hear more about that at some point. I just wanted to go through the schedule for your first council meeting on Monday. Now. We always start with the most boring stuff. Reading the minutes of the last meeting, approving the accounts, that kind of thing. How are you, sir? Good. I'm good. Quick, quick. All the way down the end. Good. Thank you. Yes. Yeah. Morning, Mayor Jenkins. It's all so tedious, nobody bothers to argue. Then we move on to the reports and the recommendations of various committees. This is a little bit more interesting but it can lead to a lot of arguments. Hm! I have a proposal here for a shopping centre in the middle of the town. This... Go on. ...this will bring jobs and money to Carmarthen and I think we should all get behind it. Where in the middle of town? The Lyric Theatre. What? This is my passion project. Huh? Come here. That old cinema is slowly falling apart and quickly going out of business, huh? Nobody goes there any more, the Lyric, not even the kids. They're all into their skateboarding, isn't it? Skateboarding. Hmm? I'm planning to build them a special place for that in the park. No, no, no. This is a golden opportunity to bring jobs and life back to Carmarthen. Hmm? It's about securing the future of our town. It's what Emlyn would have wanted. This is outrageous! I'm calling a vote. All those opposed. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. All those in favour. Aye. Aye. Good ridge? Aye. I declare the motion carried. I don't... It's terrible. I've never seen such a miserable bunch in all my life. Are you supposed to be happy or sad? Happy. So, why are you all looking so bloody miserable? I want to see some joy in your faces. Right. Jump up and down. Shake it out. Right. Go again. Remember, happy. The council just voted to knock down the Lyric. What? They're turning it into a shopping centre. They can't. They already have. Mayor Jenkins, I've just learned that the council has voted to turn the Lyric into a shopping centre. Oh! Hello, Mrs Evans. That's correct. It was a majority decision. But you can't do that. A town without a theatre loses its heart. Children without creativity lose hope. Am I right, David? Yes, Liz, you are, yeah. When I was elected mayor, I promised to bring prosperity to Carmarthen. That's exactly what we're doing. Bringing chain stores in here will force local shops out of business. It's happening all over the place. Am I right, David? Yes, Liz, yes. We've made our decision. I'm putting on another production. Not at the Lyric, you won't. The bulldozers arrive in two weeks. Bulldozers? It's a listed building. It's a pity, I know. But we've done a preliminary structural report and it looks like we'll be forced to condemn the whole building. I'll fight you in court. Ohh! Come on now, Liz. You're not going to waste all your family's money on a lawsuit. Don't try us, Mayor. You can't win. Maybe not but I can force you to delay for months, a year even. And how are you going to square that with your developer friends? All right. You've got a month if you stay out of the courts. Now, Tristan, Pete. Same again? Right. Can I get two pints of lager? I bet they're all getting kickbacks from the bloody developers. Honestly, love, you were brilliant. There's nothing else you could have done. Listen to me, we are gonna make sure the last ever performance at the Lyric is something to remember. I promise you. All right? Come on. All right, lads, let's gather round now, a little bit of a warm-up. Here we go. Yep, go. That's it. Nice and low. Yeah, start free, eh? You know what they, no pain, no gain. That's it. Five and six and seven and eight. Star jumps. Star jumps. And turn. Now run on the spot. Eat your heart out. Come on. Faster. Drumming, boys. Drumming! And shake it out. A few exercises. Shoulder roll. Roll, roll. I haven't seen your mam at the salon for a while. Let's have a little bit of energy. We've got a show to do. Thanks, Steve. Gather round. Gather round. Nick Jones, chewing gum, out. Sorry. Remember, it's no good just singing the words. You have to feel them and mean it. Understand? Yes. Yes, Liz. What do you mean I ain't got no manners? I'm a regular gent. Permit me to assist you across the road. Well, I was only going to the Palace. Doorman! A cab, if you please. What are we going to do when they close this place down, Miss? It'll be just terrible. Nothing is going to happen to Youth Opera. I can promise you that. Shall we show them how it's done? Yes! Right! Off! What's wrong with you? Right now, you should be on your way home... ...to your family... ...and your bed. Instead, you're here... ...in the Lyric. You're bonkers. Liz? Liz! Liz. I'm sorry. Oh! Oh! I'm so sorry. Are you all right? I woke up this morning and you weren't there, I was worried sick. I'm sorry. Ohh! I just crashed out. Oh! You probably want to have a shower before you go to work. I'm not going to work. Oh, no. You're not feeling sick, are you? No, no, no, no. Then go home and have a kip, love. Come on. No. I feel fine. I'm staying here. What? I'm not going to let them knock this place down. Liz, look, they've made their decision, all right? The builders are arriving this morning. Then they'll have to knock it down with me in it. This is not what we agreed. We didn't agree anything because I only just decided to do this. Oh, David. Oh, for Christ's sake, Liz. You've got a home and a family to take care of, you know? Stop being ridiculous. Oh, I'm the one being ridiculous, is it? I don't believe it. Oh! David. Cariad! What do you lot think you're doing? We were told the place was vacant. Does it look vacant to you? We've got a job to do, love. You need to get out of there. And you need to get on your bike. I'll talk to my boss. We'll be back first thing. And it won't be vacant then, either. I'll call you back. You assured me that that building was empty. What are you talking about? There is a woman in the Lyric Theatre. Well, get your men to throw her out. They're construction workers not bouncers. Then get the police to do it. Well, they might to want to see a court order and to get one of those we might have to answer some awkward questions about why we're trying to demolish a listed building. Oh! Do you really want to open that can of worms? Look, all my boys need is a day, and that building will be condemned. All right, all right. You said it's a woman inside the Lyric. Uh-huh! I'll talk to her. Your men will be able to start work first thing tomorrow. All right? They'd better. Doll? Dolly? Oh! How did you get in? The old side door. I thought the council locked that up years ago. As you always say, Liz, where there's a will there's a way. I've never paid to see a film here. Don't worry. I shut it behind me but you're going to need new locks for all the outside doors. I put the word out. So, what are you doing here? Just because you've taken a principled stand against the depredations of crony capitalism and to preserve the cultural legacy of our town, doesn't mean you have to go out of business. Mrs Hughes is booked in for a perm at 11. I told her to come straight here. And she was all right with that? Thrilled. She's gonna be on stage. She's telling all her friends. Liz! Liz! Oh, no! Liz! Oh! You said you wouldn't get in our way. I said I wouldn't take you to court. Come on, Liz. This is ridiculous. You can't just take over the place. Well, that's what you're planning to do. I'm the mayor. My job is to look after the welfare of the people of Carmarthen. Keep up the good work. Come right in, Mrs Hughes. You won't get away with this. Ohhh! Hiya. What's going on? We thought you might be lonely, Mam. So did I. But instead, I've been run off my feet. What's all this? We just brought you a few things, you know, clothes, stuff you might need. That's marvellous. Thank you. Mam. You need to talk to Dad, OK? Because he's in a right state. Well, that's between me and him. It's none of your business. It is part of our business when you decide to move into a theatre. Your dad's welcome to be part of this. You all are. Liz? I'll be a minute. Listen, why don't we talk about this later? Whatever. Oh, Huw! Come back later, OK? I'll try. OK. Cariad. Me too. Call Dad. See you later. Cariad, Mam. Caru chi. Ta-ra, Mam. Ta-ra. You sure you're going to be all right? I'll be fine. I'd be happy to stay. I could get some Mad Dog in and get hammered. Remember, tomorrow morning, first thing, eight o'clock, the first appointment. All right Ta-ra then. You'd better lock up. I am. Oh-oh! Yeah, eh? I haven't been back here for years. I thought you'd like a bit of company. There's nothing I'd like more. Yeah. Yeah, well, look at that. Oooh! Eh? Come on. Look at this place. Oh! It's fantastic, isn't it? I know. Come through here. Have a look. Oh! I know. You've got it all set up. I fancied a change of scenery. What is it? Guys And Dolls. Oh! Grand! Oh! What's your family think of this, eh? Well, I think, for the boys, it's all a big adventure. Mm! They already think I'm a bit bonkers. But, for David, it's different. He thinks I've got my priorities all wrong. It's going to take a while for people to get their heads around what's so important about a broken-down old building like this that they have to turn their lives around to save it. Eh? It doesn't look like much, does it? Hm! You know I used to have a job here. No. Yeah. Come on. I want to show you something. What? Come on. I'm intrigued. Yeah? Oh, God! Are you all right? What? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just getting a bit short of breath. Eh? I'm all right. Come on. Oh! Wow! Oh! It's almost 50 years since I worked here. Well, it hasn't changed much. So, that was before you were a teacher? Oh, yeah, long before. Yeah. No, I was, er... I was wounded in the war. And they sent me home and I got a job here at the "new" cinema. Oh! I must have seen over a hundred films from up here. What was your favourite? Goodbye, Mr Chips. Hm. You know it? No. Oh! It's almost a perfect film. It's tragic, it's sweet, it's funny. It's... But the ending... Oh! ..The ending is a real tearjerker. Yeah. Robert Don at is lying on his deathbed and he's got one regret, that he never had any children of his own. Yeah? Then he realises he's wrong, see? He's had thousands of them, the thousands of children he's taught and whose lives he's touched. Ha! Well, after that, I knew I had to become a teacher. Wouldn't it be great if we could put on a film? For who? Anyone, anyone who wants to come. Well, I'd be up for it. How can we get hold of one? Um... Well, there's nothing here. Do you remember Mr Tucker? Yes, I do. He was my old history teacher. Yes. Well, we worked in here together. Oh! He left before I did and he formed a film club in the town. He shouldn't have done, mind, but he kept back a few 35-mil prints. Oh! Yeah. Why don't I go and see him tomorrow? See what he's got. That would be amazing. Wouldn't it? Mm! That would be amazing. Oh! Morning, Mrs Jones. Morning. Morning, Mr Hopkins. Lovely day, isn't it? Rubbish men haven't been again this week. That needs organising. It's a problem. I'll talk to the mayor about it today, OK? Your father would have had it sorted by now. Only saying. Have a good day. Um... All right? Hi. I'm Dai. Nick is my boy. Hiya. I... I... I thought you were banged up. I'm out on parole, I am. Thought I'd make myself a bit useful. And there's not a lot I don't know about locks. Oh, cheers, Dai. Thank you. All right. Can you believe they want to tear all this down? Yes. What do you mean? Mam. I know how much this place means to you but the truth is it's just a cinema, a cold, draughty cinema that mainly shows films that nobody wants to see. I thought you were with me on this. We are with you, Mam. Turning this place into a shopping centre would be a crime And I'm sure it's being done for all the wrong reasons. But unless you can show people why it's so important, maybe a shopping centre is what they deserve. I've got more faith in people than that. Yeah, Mam. You'll figure it out. Right. Oh! Front, back, side. No-one's getting in you don't want to. Thank you so much. How much do I owe you? No, no, no, no. It's the least I can do. What you've done for Nick. I've never seen him happier. And I might have found myself a new line of work. Hello! I'm still here. I've got a structural survey here, it says the building is unsafe. I've had professional builders in here, ones who have not been paid off by the mayor and his developer friends, who say it's perfectly sound. Oh, and if you see the mayor, you can ask him why he let his daughter perform on stage less than a week ago if he thought it was unsafe or dangerous. Oh, just so you know, I'm not on my own in here any more. Piss off! I guess that means you're not planning to leave anytime soon. Good guess. Morning, Mayor. We really need to sort out this bin problem. I know. I've got a meeting with the union next week. Right now, I've got bigger problems with the Lyric. Ugh! Liz Evans is refusing to budge. Hmmm! Everyone was talking about that on my rounds this morning. God! What were they saying? Just that she's not budging. You know, she's doing people's hair in there. Right up on the stage. It's... Huh. Interesting. The Lyric is licensed as a place of entertainment not as a hair salon. If we can prove she's working illegally... Ha-ha! ..I can get the police to kick her out. Do you think a few perms and highlights are worth a police raid? They don't need have to go in with guns a-blazing like in the movies. They just need to serve her with a legal notice to quit. But we need proof. Huh! They're not gonna let me anywhere near that place. You, on the other hand... No, I'm... I'm not much of a spy, Mayor. Oh, everybody knows you, Richard. I don't think it's... You're their postman. A couple of photos of what they're doing is all we need. Go on, go on. Right. Just a couple of photos. Yes, sir. Just a couple. Hiya. I was wondering if one evening you might fancy a drink. I don't think so, Councillor. Huh! I promise I won't bore you with my Welsh medieval history stories. I thought you were a nice guy until you voted to turn the Lyric into a shopping centre. How much are they paying you? Nothing. What do you mean? I know he and his cronies are corrupt. I know they're getting kickbacks. What's your excuse? All right. There you go, lovely. There we go. Let's head over here. There you go. One second. You don't want one, Liz? What is it? Oh, it's my experimental cocktail. Three parts brandy, two parts rum, tomato juice and a splash of vodka. It sounds horrible. It does. That's where you're wrong. Goes down like a homesick mole, doesn't it? Dolly, can you take over for a minute? Er, yeah, course. Have a look around here. Hi. Hiya. You all right? Is there somewhere we can talk? You know, I was thinking, I think our first ever kiss was right here. No. It was right there, in fact. And I certainly remember it. How can you not love this place? It's part of our history. Yeah. I guess the world has moved on, Libby. What's bothering you? Oh, it's nothing. It's just... A lot of the men need the work, love. It's years of employment being offered to build the shopping centre. Nobody wants to see Youth Opera closed, they just... Well, they... It's just a building, innit? No. No, it's not. The Lyric is staying. Liz! Oh! Hey. I've got it, huh? That's fantastic. Take this, it's heavy, mind. OK. There. What is it? How Green Was My Valley. How Green Was My Valley? Yeah. It's a classic. You must have seen it. Well, I read the book at school. Is that all Mr Tucker had? Yeah, pretty much but it's perfect. It was made in 1941. So, it's in black and white? Of course. Yeah. Now look at this, see? See that? Directed by John Ford. Now he's the one that gave us Stagecoach, The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. But this, this is the only one that won the Oscar for best picture and best director. Oh, I'm not sure the kids are going to want to see this. Oh, we don't have to worry about them. Don't we? No. Young people are busy making their own history, hmm? It's only when you get to a certain age you realise that memory is the most precious thing in the world. And that's before you get to the age when you realise that memory is the only thing you have left. Look at this place. Oh! I mean, look at this place, huh? Oh, look. This place holds so many memories for so many people in this town. And they're the ones who will get behind you when they realise what they're about to lose. Well, we'd better let them know it's on then. We should. How Green Was My Valley I remember that, love. It's at the Lyric. Yeah? Yeah. Excuse me. Do you know what's on? They're showing How Green Was My Valley for free. I am packing my belongings in the shawl my mother used to wear when she went to the market. And I am going from my valley. And this time I shall never return. I am leaving behind me my 50 years of memory. Memory. Strange that the mind... Richard! ..will forget... Richard! ...so much of what only this moment is past... Sit here. ...and yet hold clear and bright the memory of what happened years ago, of men and women long since dead. Yet who shall say what is real and what is not? And I believe my friends all gone... Pick and Mix? ...when their voices are still a glory in my ears? No. And I will stand to say no and no again, for they remain a living truth within my mind. There is no fence nor hedge round Time that is gone. And the valley would ring with the sound of many voices, for singing is in my people as sight is in the eye. Men like my father cannot die. They are with me still, real in memory as they were in flesh, loving and beloved forever. How green was my valley then. What? Yankee sugar-coated bullshit. Those cheery miners singing like Disney dwarfs. They're victims of capitalist exploitation. Have you no bloody soul? It's a celebration of a way of life. - And they seem to like it. - More! Yeah! Miserable sod. Thank you so much for coming. I saw a tear in your eye during some of those scenes. It was very dusty in there. Aye, aye. We can agree to disagree about Hollywood's depiction of Welsh culture but that's the point of the arts, isn't it? They cause controversy. Oh, absolutely. That's why we've got to join the fight to save this place from that sleazeball of a mayor. I mean, a new Woolworths doesn't spark much debate, does it? Well, their pick and mix does. Congratulations to both of you. I thought that went really well, eh? Fabulous. Yeah. I loved the singing. Did you hear me? I was upstairs singing. No. Yes, yes. - I took a solo. - Oh! Why don't you come by tomorrow night for dinner? We'll work out what we're going to put on next. Yeah, yeah, I'd like that. Carmarthen Police Get me SI Roberts on the phone. I'm coming. Liz Evans? Yes. This is a warrant for your arrest. Go back. Go back, inside, inside. Right. Here we go. Good. Let me know the minute the building is totally cleared. Susan? Susan! Susan! We need to get social services down here right away. There's two minors at least. There's nothing we can do about it. I'm from the council. Mam? Stop what you're doing. Who are you? Their lawyer. Sorry I'm late. You can tell your clients, I've got them bang to rights. Bang to rights? You've been watching too many police dramas. OK. Criminal trespass and operating an unlicensed business. And the complaint was filed by USG Screens. I represent USG. My clients lease this building. Excellent. Do you have a copy of the lease with you? Thank you. Paragraph 15, section C, subsection three, grants access to employees of the town council. See? Well, we won't be arresting you then. But they're coming with me. No, no, please. It's OK. Look at me, look at me. Paragraph 26, section D, subsection four. The stage of the Lyric Theatre will be made available to the Carmarthen Youth Opera up to four times a year. They are the principals of the Carmarthen Youth Opera. It's them. I saw them in Jesus Christ Superstar. It was brilliant. We've still got them on operating an unlicensed business. Oh, Mam, please. Have you ever been to a theatre before, officer? That is a set. For what? Um... Hairspray. Oh! I saw the film of that, yeah. Debbie Harry was in it. I was on my own mind but it was... brilliant. I suggest you release everyone without charges and leave right now. Or you can tell the world in open court, that you arrested a bunch of actors for being on a stage. Thank you. And we need that front door fixed by the morning. They did it. So sue them. Susan! Thank you so much. How did you do that? Have you boys heard the story of how your mam and dad fell in love on stage? Only about a hundred times. Oh, yes. Stella... Stella! ALL: Stella! That's you that is. It's Brando. I have always depended on the kindness of strangers. That was pretty good. I did not do it like that. You did, Mam. You've got to admit he's pretty good, isn't he? Have you seen the film? Have you seen the film? I haven't seen the film, no. Marlon Brando. Stella! So, have you ever acted, Mr Morgan? Ah! Yeah, well, in my dreams. Oh! Yeah. Must be wonderful, eh? Stand on a stage, look out at the audience and know you've got them in the palm of your hand here. Must be the best feeling in the world. I love it. Hmm! A bit like teaching. You know, standing in front of a class. Yeah. Did you boys like the film last night? Yeah, we did. I mean, it was a bit cheesy. Cheesy? But towards the end... How Green Was My Valley cheesy? It was in black and white. I don't agree with that. So, what are we going to put on next? Well, whatever it is, it'll have to be something popular. This place has got to work as a business, isn't it? Yes. Otherwise, it will be a struggle to keep open. I agree. It's got to be something that will bring the kids in. Your friends. Something new. Something new. Something new? Yes. Such as? Come on. I haven't got a clue. You've got school in the morning. Oh! Oh! Well... Well, that was a wonderful evening. Thanks so much, eh? I'd be happy to run you home. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, listen, could you bring those cans of film for me sometime? Yeah. No urgency, you know. Tomorrow on the way back from work. Yeah. All right. Nos da. Nos da. Nos da now. Nos da! Nos da. Tara, Mam. Cariad. Are you gonna be all right now? I'll be fine. Mmm! Make sure they go to bed. Yeah, I will, don't worry. You know. Yeah, I know. No television. OK. Nos da. Nos da. Goodbye, Mr Morgan. Goodbye. Right. I'll get you boys home, yeah? Come on with me. I thought you'd gone home. Look, I just wanted to come back and, er... Well, ask your forgiveness. For what? For ever doubting you. You proved to me... Well, not just to me, to everyone, that this place is worth fighting for. Look, I should have been all in from the beginning, I know. But I am now... and forever. Oh, David. I love you. I love you too, Liz. They're very expensive. Oh, just from the garage. Mam! Mam! Mam! Mam, look at this, look at this. What is it? It's a trade magazine. We sent off for it. It has a list of all the films that are coming out. Look at The Firm. That's with Tom Cruise in it. That'll be really good. Or Free Willy. That looks even better. Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg. I think it's about dinosaurs. I've read the book. Oh, it's fantastic. So, they find these mosquitos that have been trapped in amber for, like, millions of years. But before they died, the mosquitos had bitten dinosaurs and had the dinosaur blood in them. So, they get the dinosaur blood out of the mosquitos, they sequence the dino DNA and then... No, no. Stop it. You're gonna spoil it for us. Um... So, what do we think? Do we think it's going to be a hit? Are you joking, Mam? Mam, it's going to be massive. It'll be the biggest ever. Liz, I'd pay to see it. Jurassic Park needs to be the next film we show at the Lyric. How are we going to pull that off? Where's there's a will there's a way. Mr Morgan. Dai Evans. Mr Morgan? Oh, there you are. I've got your film cans. I can't stay long, the van's badly parked. Mr Morgan? Please, no. Mr Morgan. Because their words had forked no lightning They do not go gentle into that good night. Good men, the last wave by... ...crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way Do not go gentle into that good night. You're sure they're all there? Absolutely sure? As far as I can tell. And you, my father... Right... there. Susan. Get me Martyn O'Byrne on the phone. Putting him through on line one. Martyn. It's empty. Empty for how long? For however long a funeral in Dryslwyn takes. It'll take the best part of an hour to get the men and the heavy equipment there. So do it. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Now let us all join together to celebrate the life of Hywel Morgan. First and foremost, Mr Morgan was a teacher. He taught hundreds of boys and girls in Carmarthen. I was one of them. He inspired us all. The most important thing he taught me, he taught all of us, is that this place, its history, its identity, its culture, its people, makes us who we are, makes us what we are. He's called the builders. Who has? The mayor. He said to bring the heavy equipment. How long? Why do you care? How long before they get to the Lyric? An hour. But that was 30 minutes ago. We should all, every one of us, be proud of our community... Let's go. ..and our heritage. As this community is threatened, now more than ever we need to hon our his legacy and continue his fight. With Hywel Morgan's passing, it is our turn to stand on the shoulders of a giant of a man. It's our turn to save the soul of our community. It's our turn to rage against the dying of the light. Come on, Dad. Go faster. We're not going to make it in time. Come on. Oi! Watch it! Ugh! Oi! Stop him! Get off! Oi! Ugh! Come on! What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm stopping you from doing something that will affect the lives of everyone who lives here. Councillor Good ridge. Get down from there. No! I'm not letting you destroy the Lyric. You voted for it, you clown! It was a dreadful mistake. Listening to you, I made a dreadful mistake. Get him down from there now. What on earth are you doing up there? I don't know. But I'm part of the town council now, so... I don't care. It doesn't put you above the law. Tell that to bloody him. If you don't move, I'm going to have to arrest you. Get him down! Get him down! I've had enough. Just swing the bloody thing. Come on. Be my guest. You do not have to say anything... There you go. ...unless you wish to do so but what you say may be given in evidence. You're gonna have to arrest all of us, starting with me. Yeah, and me. And me. Come on, woman! Do your job. Arrest all of them. Arrest them! Hello, Wendy. Minister. Oh, Christ! On the subject of Christ, our Saviour, you're going to have to arrest me as well. Go on, Father. As mayor of Carmarthen, I'm ordering you to do your job. I don't work for you, Mayor Jenkins. I work for the people of Carmarthen. Yeah. So do I. I don't think so. I think you work for him. All right. Right, you lot, Get this machine out of here now. I don't want to see you here again without a court order. Understand? This is ridiculous. Ah! You tell him. Right, let's go. Come on! And I'm letting you off with a warning. Pick a side and stick with it. You're gonna get a firmly worded letter from me! Let's go in the Lyric. Brilliant. Cocktails for everyone. Well done, Richard. Well, it seems I misjudged you. Go on. It was very brave of you to jump on top of a 10,000lb wrecking ball. Really? 10,000lb? Oh, give or take. Oh! I just saw it and I couldn't think of anything else to do. Well, it worked. Yeah. But you know, um... ...there is something else you could do. I don't know the first thing about being a bloody mayor. But I do and I'll help you. You know, win or lose, you know, this could be a platform to get our message out. It could be a game-changer. All right. I need one of these to go through every letterbox in Carmarthen, right? I can do that, can't I? No. You're excused from postman duties today. Instead, you are going down to the Herald offices. Lynn's expecting you in 15 minutes. And then at three o'clock, BBC Radio Wales want to interview you. Interview? Yeah. You'll be fine. Bloody Good ridge. This is absurd. All I know is, there's thousands of them in people's letterboxes, at lampposts, bus shelters. All right, all right. I get the idea. But he's not even on the ballot. There's a space where you can write in a new candidate's name. Who's going to do that? I also heard that Aled and Darek have withdrawn from the election and they're supporting him. That's six votes for the bloody idiot right there. I'm trembling. He's giving interviews to the Herald. He's on the radio. You need to respond. He's making this all about the Lyric. Nobody cares about that old ruin. Oh, morning, Liz. All right, Susan? So, how's it looking on the dinosaur front? The distributor gave us a flat no. They won't give a copy to a cinema that's to be demolished. Etcetera, etcetera. So I've decided to go straight to the top. Who's at the top? Dear Mr Spielberg. My name is Liz Evans and I run a youth theatre group in Carmarthen, Wales. We put on our performances in the Lyric, an art deco building that was turned into a cinema in 1935. The town council, in its wisdom, wants to knock down the building and replace it with a shopping centre. Now, that's as far as I've got for now. But I'm going to go on and explain how showing Jurassic Park will help save the Lyric. Oh! I've got some of the mayor's stationery. It will look more official if you send it on this. Oh! And then I'll intercept any letters coming in from America. Marvellous On my rounds as a postman, every day people talk to me about their issues, bin collection, transport, parking, schools. Lots of them have ideas about how to improve our lives in Carmarthen. Now, if I'm elected mayor, my most important job will be to listen to them. Every single one of them. He's a natural. It's still odds on for Tom to win, mind. So we've got to get everyone we can out to vote. Radio... A lot of people have read about your heroics in the campaign to save the Lyric Theatre. I'm not sure how heroic... Richard Good ridge is just a postman. Yes? I'm there. Thank you. The real hero is Liz Evans who put her life on hold to lead the campaign. I'm very proud of my community. We're both very proud of its history. Listen. We all need to be clear that it's not for sale. Not at any price. You all right? Still nothing from Mr Spielberg. I'm sure he's busy promoting his new film. Besides, it's only been a couple of months. If we can't find a way to get people to come here again and start spending money... ...I don't know what I'm going to do. Hey. Hey, like you say, Liz, yeah? Where there's a will there's a way. Hey! Look at what you've achieved so far. Some of those people here the other night, they hadn't left their house for weeks. They hadn't seen each other in years. You brought them back together. The Lyric is important. And you will find a way to keep it going, right? Right. Now get out there and vote. I want to see the look on Tom Jenkins's face when he's booted out of his office. All right. Thank you. You're very welcome. We need you. Chin up. Darlene, will you go and get me a whisky and Babycham? Ohh! Coming up. A double. Do you want one as well? Do you fancy one. I'll have one. Why not? Yes, come on. Let's go. As clerk of the town council, I declare that in the election for mayor of Carmarthen the votes cast were as follows. For Tom Jenkins, 4,617. For Richard Good ridge, 4,711. Accordingly, I declare that Richard Good ridge has been duly elected to serve as Mayor of Carmarthen. Recount! Call for you on line one. Thank you. Right. Hello. Mayor Good ridge. Mayor Good ridge. Let it ring. I'm doing that. Let them ring. Hello. Mayor Good ridge. Press then ring. Hello. Hello. Mayor Good ridge. Hello. This is Jennifer Costas from Amblin Pictures in Los Angeles. Hello? Right. Good. Hi. Hello. I'm calling about the Lyric Theatre. I passed on the letter that you and Mrs Evans wrote to Mr Spielberg. And I just thought I would call you myself and relay the information. Thank you. It's not every day I can call a real live mayor. Mr Mayor. Yes. That's me. Yes. Mayor of Carmarthen, Wales. Carmarthen, Wales. It sounds so romantic. Where in the world is it? It's in Wales. Oh, yes, of course. I'm sure it's very beautiful. Listen, are you and Mrs Evans free to speak in an hour? Free in an hour? I don't think... Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Great. Yes, we are, yes. Great. I'll speak to you in an hour then. Bye-bye. Unbelievable. I'm coming. Scissors and Combs. Dolly speaking. Are you having me on? You're joking. Er... Er... All right. Er, she'll be there. OK. Bye. Liz. Liz! It's him. Who? Steven Spielberg. What? Steven Spielberg on the phone. Don't be daft. He's not going to be calling us on a payphone. No. He's calling the mayor's office in half an hour. Now, hang on. What about my hair? This is peroxide. Oh, I can have a go. No of fence, Dolly, but there's only one woman who does my hair and it's Elizabeth. OK. Stay calm, stay calm. Hello. Mayor Good ridge. This is Steven Spielberg. It's a pleasure to speak to you. It's a pleasure to speak to you too. But you should be speaking with Liz Evans. She's the one leading the campaign to try and save the Lyric Theatre. Shall I call back? No, she's right here. I'll pass you over to her now. OK. Hello. This is Liz Evans. Mrs Evans, it sounds like you're in the middle of a hell of a fight. I am. Can you believe they want to knock down an art deco building and put up a shopping centre? So, you want Jurassic Park? Yes, please, Mr Spielberg. I think showing your new film would really help save the Lyric. It would be tremendous. What I'm going to do is, I'm going to send you my personal copy and you can out it on three minutes after the London premiere starts. How's that? Oh, my God! I... It doesn't seem real. I... I don't know what to say. Er... Oh, thank you. Thank you so much, Mr Spielberg. Good luck saving your theatre. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thanks. Goodbye, Mrs Evans. Oh, my God! He's gonna give us the film. You're joking. He's going to give us the film! Well? You look great. Amazing. I feel a bit of a... No, no. Honestly. Are you sure? Really handsome. Your hat. No. Just carry it. OK. OK. Shall we? Let's. Knock 'em dead. OK. Mayor Good ridge. Good afternoon. Can you tell us what we're going to see? Enough now. Quiet. There she is. Look, look. You look beautiful there. I couldn't believe it. I thought that Richard and Dolly were playing a joke on me. It really was him, it was Steven Spielberg. He's giving the Lyric his personal copy of his new film. Liz, thanks very much. Love you. And it's back to you in the studio. Back to studio! Well done, Mam. Well done, Mam. That was good. Hiya. Hi, Susan. I found a few of these in storage in the town hall. They're from when Prince Charles visited ten years ago, do you remember? Yeah. Anyway, I thought we might be able to sue them at the premiere. Yeh! It's going to be great. Is anyone famous coming? No, but because it's a people's premiere, why don't we all just pretend to be celebrities? All right. Get to school now. Come on. Oh! Got to go, man. Give us one of those crisps. No, Wynne. How's Richard? Oh, he's great. He's on his way to London. Channel 4 were so impressed with his interviews yesterday they asked him to be on the Big Breakfast. No. No. He's going to be in bed? What? No. They're interviewing him. Yeah. That's how they do it on the Big Breakfast. Yeah. The guests get into bed with the presenter and she asks them questions. Are you having me on? No. No. Oh, yes. Give me those crisps. You should pop by tomorrow and we'll watch it together in the morning. All right. I don't think we've ever had a real live mayor in bed before. I'm just yanking your chain. She's flirting with him. Is it real gold? Mm-hm! That's how they do it on the show. So you talked to Steven Spielberg? Yes, just for a moment. Then I passed him onto Liz Evans, she's the one leading the campaign to save the Lyric Theatre in Carmarthen. It's her passion and her energy that really got, er... got Steven behind the project at all. Passion and energy. I like the sound of that. What is it? Or should I ask who is it you're passionate about, Richard? I think... I hope... they know who they are. That was Richard Good ridge. Carmarthen's newest sexy mayor. What? See you after the break. Richard. Richard! Hello. Hello. There he is. Thank you. Our local star. You saw it then? Yeah, it was brilliant. Ah! Thank you. Thank you. It was one of the strangest experiences of my life but I think I said everything I wanted to for sure. You were great this morning. Thank you. You really were. Thank you. The place looks amazing. Oh! Speaking of which. Boys! Look what I've got from London. What are they? Massive inflatable dinosaurs. Thanks. Whoa! Thank you. Oh! Hiya. Hey! Hello. How's the um... the office? Everything's under control. Lovely. Hmm! Do you remember, um...? Do you remember asking whether I'd like to go for a drink with you sometime? Yeah. Well, I've thought about it some more. And I've decided I would. You would? Mm! Well, fantastic. Um... When? Now. Now? Now? Look. Susan. Hi. Hi. That looks good. Thank you. Hello. Now, get these down you and tell me what you think. Oh, OK. Can I ask what it is? You can. So, for this occasion, I've invented a range of prehistoric cocktails. Uh-huh! This is a T-Rextacy. Clever. And that is a Velicirapture. Right. And what's in it? You don't want to know. Go on! OK, well, iechyd da. Yes. Oh, hang on. I, er... Oh, that's strong. Oh, it's lovely. No, it's lovely. Smashing. I'll... I'll be back there. I, er... I wasn't sure you, er... If you saw the, er... My, er, hold... Well, they promised me a limo but I've ended up in this. Good afternoon to you. Now, minutes after the premiere in London, the people of Carmarthen are about to enjoy one of the first screenings of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park. You join me right in the heart of Carmarthen... Here in Carmarthen, there are no freebies for the rich and famous. Everyone has got to buy their own ticket. The cost? Â£2.50 or half price for children. Doesn't seem to have stopped anybody coming out, though. Let's have a word with a few of them. Who have we got here? Hello. And you are? Hello. I'm Mavis, Mavis Jones. And, Mavis, do you live in Carmarthen? Yes, I've lived here all my life. I work in Tesco's on Pensarn Road. And are you looking forward to seeing the film? Yes, very much so. Steven Spielberg. So, Mavis, enjoy the film. Thank you. And with that, it's back to you in the studio. The combination of Princess Diana and dinosaurs is obviously dynamite. So Leicester Square came to a complete halt this evening as, inside, the Princess of Wales greeted Sir Richard Attenborough who plays the owner of Jurassic Park. Steven Spielberg himself has suggested that children under 13 shouldn't be allowed to see what some have called Jaws With Claws. Oh, yeah. We've got all the bigwigs in tonight. Oh, thank you so much for coming. - We're going to sit down now. - I've got an idea. Dave, it's only right that the people of Carmarthen should see Jurassic Park first. Right. Not the London people. So, what are you thinking? Us. Go on. There. Yes! Come on. The townsfolk in Carmarthen in North Wales say nothing ever happens in their town and their theatre never gets new films like Jurassic Park. But this year, they took a stand. They appealed directly to director Steven Spielberg, who arranged to have the film make its debut in Wales in their humble hamlet and it worked. Spielberg cut through the red tape and arranged to get the theatre a print of the film for the premiere. It's a story with a happy ending. Residents say it is the most exciting thing to happen in years. Right. Let's go to a premiere. We did it.
