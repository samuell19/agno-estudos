See who finally showed up. Paige, go to the corner and stretch, please. I'm fine. I'm sure you are. Now go! Chin up and keep the line strong. Somebody's definitely in trouble. If you're late all the time. Have I missed something ladies? Annabel, move to the other side of the barre. OK everyone, let's move to center. Is something wrong? I was wondering if you could make this look any more difficult. Don't bite your lip. Paige, you are a performer. Everyone should think that this is easy. Again. Lynda, open up. I know you're here, your car's outside. This is ridiculous, just open the door. Dad? Hey buddy, can you open the door? No. I'm sorry Dad, Mom says I can't open it. Come on, Alex! It's fine, Alex. Lynda, it's so like you. You told my lawyer you didn't receive the paperwork. I'm just going to leave it under the door. Please go through it and call me. He didn't even say bye. It's OK, honey, he's just upset... with me. What's that? Just paperwork. Didn't you say you had something to show me? Yes! We need to use a computer. Follow me. Reverence! Good job everyone! Paige, we'll start in five. Nice. I've been worried about you. Glenn, I'm sorry I was late. How are things at home? Shall we start? Someone has that San Francisco audition soon. Excellent work tonight. I think you're about ready. Let's go home. That class felt so long. How many pliés did we do, like a hundred? I know. We did so many. My legs are killing me. Yeah, mine too. How was your private, Paige? Fine I guess, could've been better. Paige, you're never happy. Come on guys our ride's here. Is Paige in there? Yeah she's inside. Good. See you girls tomorrow. One second. Come in. What's wrong with your foot? Nothing. It's not a big deal. You don't have to kill yourself, Paige. I'm just trying so hard, and ballet is the only thing I want to do. You don't understand. I do understand. It's getting late, you better go. I'll see you tomorrow. It's almost midnight. Mom, please don't start this, it's only eleven. Come here. Sit. I called you. My phone was dead. The calls went through. Well then I didn't hear it, sorry. We need to talk about your recent test scores. Is there a problem? Yeah, Alex showed me you're not doing well in math. I got two B's. So what? Well... I signed you up with a math tutor after school. You what? - I signed you up... - I heard that. Mom, my grades are fine. I don't need a tutor. Alex has C's. Does he need a tutor? You know well enough he's a smart boy. He does not need a tutor. And we can't afford to pay for both ballet class and a tutor. I have two important auditions coming up. I can't afford to take anytime off. Well, improve your grades and then we can talk about all your auditions. But right now, you need to focus on getting into college. Like I'm even going. I heard that young lady, and to tell you the truth, I am sick of all of this. All you do is dance. You don't go and experience life. There's so much more to it and you don't even know- Like what? What would you prefer me to do? Go out, party, get drunk and high with my friends? Well, I don't have to worry about that. You spend so much time dancing, you don't have any friends to get high or drunk with. What is your problem with me dancing? I'm so much better now, but I don't even remember the last time you bothered to even come and watch me. My point is, maybe, just maybe, this will be good for you. To take a break from dancing go to college- Maybe... you could just respect what I want to do. Or... Maybe you need to look in a mirror. And finally see... Yeah, you got a degree, but it didn't stop Dad from leaving you.

Well, we haven't paid for this months ballet classes, so your schedule cleared up. Hey! Where are you going? What about breakfast? I lost my appetite. Mom, I didn't lose my appetite!

Listen, I just dropped Alex off at school and I'm going to an interview. I don't have time to discuss our issues right now. Lynda, there's nothing to discuss. I need you to sign the papers. Derek! I am running late for an interview. I am taking care of two kids. I want to talk, so let's just schedule a time when we can go over all of it, OK? So Lynda, we're looking for someone who just graduated university for an entry level position. You don't have enough experience for our higher positions. But I was told you help women like me who are struggling- Honey listen, I know you think this is the worst that it can get. But we just hired two disabled ladies. So you're saying you can't help me because I'm not disabled. Even though I'm about to be left on my own with two kids? I wish you had more experience because you have a relevant degree. But I can't help you right now. You can come back later? I just really need this right now. ♪ I thought time and space ♪ ♪ Were on my side ♪ - Dylan? - Paige? Sorry I'm late. So, you're my tutor?

You stayed at school for so long... I had some stuff to do, Alex. Oh Paige... Um... I just got off with the phone with... Ahh... what's his name... Ah Dylan. What does he need? Well, he said you made a lot of progress today. Oh... I guess we did. He sounds very-very nice. Oh also, he mentioned the... Grand Canyon trip. I don't know why you've never mentioned it - What? The Grand Canyon. I signed you up! Oh! So now you get to decide where I go... and when. Great! Hey! Ugh... Dinner is in thirty minutes. You've made her mad again.

That's not for me. I just get you there. Follow me. So, how is your day going so far? Oh! Good! Thank you. How is yours? Pretty good. Thanks. Good luck. Well, hi. If I didn't know you guys, I'd think you're stalking me. Oh... You know. It looks like you're hiding from us. Well, there is no where to run now. Very funny, Paige. Glenn wants to talk to you. Just tell him I quit. You can't be serious. We don't have time for this, Paige. Whatever it is, it can't be that bad. Just show up for practice. I have a math tutor. That's hilarious. Did you fail or something? I got two B's. But to my mom, that's basically failing. Your mom's always been intense. Do you remember when you were younger and your mom was crazy about competitions? It was so long ago, I almost forgot. Well, I didn't. Shoot, Leah, we're super late. It's all your fault. Just come to the academy after school. You should really talk to Glenn. Hi. I'm... I'm Lynda Johnson. Harry, nice to meet you. Please have a seat. So what kind of position are you looking for? Oh... any entry level position is fine. What job experience do you have in this field? Well, I graduated from the University of Arizona. I got a degree in economics, I did a couple of internships during college, and... then I took care of my kids for 17 years. But what job experience do you have? Uh... Well, like I said I had three internships during school, and being a stay-at-home mom requires its own kind of supply and demand economics. Hmm. What I meant was, why did you decide to change fields? I just... Ugh... I really need the money right now. So you're looking for something temporary? Oh, no. That's not what I meant. I'm absolutely serious about this. Do you know how to use Excel? Yeah, of course. Great. We will let you know our decision by the end of next week. - OK. - Thank you. Thank you. Asshole. What kind of experience do you have in the field? You're late. Again. Don't tell me it's your dinner. It's not my favorite. You don't have to eat it if you don't like it. I was wondering... could we change the time of our sessions? Sounds like someone's asking for a favor. No. You told my mom about our trip to the Grand Canyon, and this is just payback. Come on! It's gonna be a lot of fun. Seriously... I really need to train for this audition. Can we change the time until after classes? I usually rehearse right after class. Music. I play music. Are you serious? I'm auditioning for the San Francisco Ballet Theater, and you can't change your time because of... music stuff? You see, anyone can be a ballerina. No training, no classes needed. It's hard to deny you have some pretty impressive moves. I can teach you. Oh yeah? All right. Fine, we can meet right after class. Thank you. I think we should get going.

What happened between the two of you? She has different ideas about how I should spend my free time. I think you were 11 when you joined our school? I think so. I'll tell you what we can do. You can come for class and rehearsals for free until your San Francisco audition. Really? Thank you so much. Should I get it? Oh... No, honey. Ah... I got it. Hello. I can start tomorrow. Great. Oh, thank you so much. Who called? What honey? Who called? Ahh, well, if you have to know, smarty pants, I got a job. Like a real job? Yeah. Like Dad? Yeah... Like Dad. Cool. Look at all of them. They've come so far... And so have you. Paige, are you also going on that trip... Leah, where's the trip to? - The Grand Can- - The Grand Canyon. Yeah, I am. Good for you. See it's OK to have some fun sometimes. Now you sound like my mom. You need to get some rest. And hey, you two, let's go, let's go. I remember you. You interviewed that day Harry was so cranky. Ugh... I hope the employee orientation wasn't too overwhelming... It was impressively long. It's company policy. Oh. Soo-o... This is your desk. I know it... it kinda sucks. Do you think a plant would help? Mmmmm. No. I mean I have a cactus, but it's slowly dying. Oh, no light? No, I'm pretty sure I'm just really bad with plants. Umm... So, you know what to do? Mh-mm, just organize... all of this. - Good luck. - Hmm. Paige! How are you? I'm... good. Is everything OK? Yeah, everything is fine. I've gotta run. And Glenn is in no mood today. Good luck. I'm fine. It's all going to be fine. I'm ready. Hey! How is your first day going? Ohh... What happened to you? Um... This building is sucking the energy out of me. Well, I like your sense of humor. Umm... Hmmm... Are you done for the day? Yes, a group of us we usually go out after work on Mondays. You should come. What? We're cool. Oh no-no-no... No. I have kids. Soo-o... get a babysitter. Husband? Boyfriend? Hmm, no. It's just... it's complicated. See! You should definitely join us. Can I get a rain check? Bye. Bye. Knock-knock. Come in. You missed dinner. I already ate at school, and... healthy snack. Can you close your laptop, please? Just let me help you. Oh, well, I guess I should have waited for the miracle of you cleaning your room. You shouldn't have to pick up for me. What were you watching? Like you even care. Well... Do you want to watch something together? Do you really wanna watch ballet? Or... Do you want to watch me dance? Well, I do have a lot of laundry. I can dance right here, right now. Let's just talk. About? Did you talk to your dad at all? He called me. I didn't answer. He's still your father. He left without saying a word. I think he just needs time. I do have some great news though... I got a job. - Really? - Come on! Why is everyone so surprised at this? So, it's serious then? You and Dad? I don't know. But you need to call him back. Whatever. I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed. OK. Good night. Yeah... Twenty years of marriage and you have nothing to say? Hi, Paige! How's ballet? Seriously? Ballet? You can't talk to your daughter about anything more meaningful? What? Oh-Talk to her about college... I... I mean if you paid any attention. What's going on with her? She didn't even say "hi". What did you expect? A daddy of the year speech? At least "hi" to her dad, who she hasn't seen in a while. Oh! Welcome to my life. She's a teenager now, in case you hadn't noticed. Oh yes, Lynda! I didn't notice that my daughter's grown up. Well, it wouldn't surprise me if you hadn't. Can you not smoke? No! If I wanna smoke, I will! As much as I'd like! Fine. Lynda, I didn't come here to argue. Why did you come here? Please, stop. Stop what? I came because you told me to. Why couldn't you just sign the papers? Derek, I really think we can fix this if we work it... - Lynda. - Alex! Lynda! I met someone. And I love her. And I cannot be with you. Come on, Alex! Get back to your room! Mom and Dad are getting a divorce! Shhhh! Be quiet! What do you want me to do? I don't know, OK? I have to go. I can't take the kids. They need stability. And we need some privacy. Ohh! So that's what this is about! You want a new life with your new girlfriend! No worries, Dad. I don't care about you either. Paige, hon! I didn't - Are you happy now? Hey, Paige! Hey. Are you OK? What happened? Lili, I know you're trying to help, but I really need you not to say anything and walk away right now. OK. Did you warm up? - Good luck. - Thank you. Mariam, help Paige fix her hair. OK. That's OK. Thank you. Should I find Glenn? Everything is fine. So, there's food in the fridge, and Alex goes to bed around ten. - Uhm... - Yes, no worries. Sorry, I just wanna to go over everything... This is... the first time I've left my kids with a babysitter. Totally understand. And what about- Oh... Paige. Ahh... she's meeting with her math tutor tonight, so you don't have to worry about her. Hey, honey... is everything OK in there? It's fine, Mom. I'm studying. OK, well... I'm going out, and... Sarah's watching Alex. Sounds good. OK. Hello. Hey! How was it? I feel like a fool for even trying. Woah-woah-woah... It couldn't be that bad. No... no... It was that bad. You know what? We're having a party at my place. You should come over! Yeah. A party... That's exactly what I need right now. Come on, Paige. It's better than crying on the floor of your bedroom. Forget about dancing for a night! I've had such a long day. Don't be like that. OK. What time? One, two... three. Paige? Hey! I'm here... for the party. I'm Dylan's friend. I know. Come in. I didn't catch your name... I didn't give it to you. I'm Kate. Nice to meet you. We have science together. I'm so sorry. No problem. I'm just messing with you. Let's go. Oh, hi! Lynda! You showed up! Yeah... I... decided to join the crowd. I'm so glad you did! You need a drink! And I need one too. We have a table right here. Oh... great. I can't believe you're actually here! I can't believe it either. I mean, I left my kids at home with a babysitter- No talk about kids or husbands tonight. We need drinks. Hi. Can I get a martini, please. Shots! Here's to us! To us. Let's dance. OK. This is for you. Thanks. Don't worry. It's just punch. We have a no alcohol policy. Oh.

My mom doesn't know I'm here, and I really don't wanna get in trouble tonight. And that's the only reason why you're leaving? Uh-huh. You should've said bye. Bye. Paige? I know you snuck out. Well, you'd better keep it between us. You aren't even supposed to be awake. How are you doing there? I just don't understand this. I can help if you want. Nah... I've spent three hours trying. I'm done for today. You should go let Mom know. Oh no. Thank you, but no. The second she finds out, you'll get the focus of attention. You know how fun that could be? Mh-mm. Yesterday was awful. I can't believe they're gonna get divorced. You don't know that! Alex, I'll always be around. Till you're gone with your stupid ballet. Hey! I mean it. I'll always be here for you. Promise? I promise. Hi, everyone. You're early today. Stand up. Do a triple pirouette. I haven't warmed up yet. That hasn't stop you before. Let's see it. Again. Again! That's right! See, you are capable of it! Easily! I'm sorry. I don't know what happened at the audition. Being a performer means nothing will distract you! I understand. Take your place at the barre. So... you left your clutch last night. Look at you, all shiny and bright. You sound like you're in your late forties. Come on! So, did he take you home or... It didn't go any further. Seriously... what's going on? Well, I'm thirty six, and texting my soon-to-be ex-husband after the worst night of my life. No offense. And I'm trying to figure out what to do with my teenage daughter, who thinks she has everything figured out. Well, do you? What? Do you have everything figured out? You wouldn't understand. You don't have kids. No, but I have a mom. I mean it took us a while before we were able to have any kind of a relationship. You can't always expect things to turn out exactly as you planned them. I'm just so afraid of being alone. Derek and I have been going together since our freshman year of college. I've always been with him... and I don't know who I am without him. Well... Maybe, this is your chance to find out who you are. Yeah, I'm just not sure if I'm ready to let him go. I still hope that I can fix it somehow. Not everything can be fixed. Sometimes we have to let go. I have to get to a meeting. If you ever need to talk... you know where my office is. Thank you, Jessica. Paige! Come here. Follow me to my office. You look different. How so? It looks like you've lost a lot of weight. That's a good thing, right? Do you think that's good? Tell me, what have you eaten? Umm... carrots, I've been eating a lot of vegetables. For every meal? I... I don't know. I don't remember. Paige. I'm just not hungry. Do you feel you need to loose weight? No! No... I'm not doing it on purpose. My family... I can't eat. Go grab some food, and come back to the studio. Paige, I'm serious. Fine. I'll eat.

Since I'm back to straight As, I thought it would be a good time to talk about it. I don't recall talking about San Francisco at all. The company I want to get into is San Francisco Ballet Theater. I thought we already discussed dance and your future. You said that when my grades improved... that we could talk-Alex! I'm trying to talk to Mom! What are you doing? Dancing! Mom told me even a monkey could do it. It takes so much, and you never get it. You're right. We are done here. Hey! Plate, please! Don't forget about your school trip! Alex! Alex! What did Paige do now? Did you see your sister this morning? Yes, she left around nine. You were asleep. ♪ Don't hold your breath ♪ ♪ For one second too long ♪ ♪ You know one day We're here ♪ ♪ And the next We're gone ♪ ♪ There's a whole lot ♪ ♪ Of world to see ♪ ♪ Hold your breath ♪ ♪ For one second too long ♪ ♪ You know one day We're here ♪ ♪ And the next We're gone ♪ Paige! Get over here this instant! I am not going to repeat myself. Let's go! Did I tell you to stop? And! Plié! Mom! Stop! We're leaving right now, I- don't even have words! What are you even doing here? I tried talking to you last night. You don't even listen to me! I need to practice for San Francisco. I've never even heard about an audition in San Francisco before last night. And if I had, I would've said "No". Mom... You promised me! You said if I improve my grades, and I did. I never promised, I said we'd talk about it, and we did... last night. Talk? You didn't even hear me out! You lied to me. Oh! Well you want to talk about lying? OK! Let's talk about lying. Don't change the subject! Michael! Focus, please. I told you I need to practice for San Francisco! I also need a lot of things in this world! Do I get it? No. You didn't get into the company, you already auditioned for, so why waste time on another! That audition... doesn't even matter! I will get into the San Francisco Ballet Theater. Oh, honey. This was very cute when you were a kid, but now... this is just pathetic. Pathetic? Not as pathetic as you... controlling my life because you have nothing left. I'm in the middle of class, this is not the place! We're leaving. Now. - We need to talk. - No. We don't. She's not allowed to be here. End of conversation. Paige has an important audition, coming up Sunday... Yes, in San Francisco, which she will be not be attending! Are you ready? Grab your stuff, drive straight home! So nice to see you! I need your keys! Yeah, that's right. You're losing your car privileges. And how am I supposed to get to school? I'll drive you. Great. Whoops... sorry. Paige, you were wrong. You went behind my back. At least I don't make promises I can't keep. No... Wait, you just didn't want to keep them. I'm not going to discuss this with you again. Dad promised me! I honestly don't care what Dad promised. Dad's not here, and I am. Hey, Paige! Good to hear from you, hon. Dad, I need your help. Paige, I'm sorry. I can't- Paige? Paige! Are you still there? Paige? Breakfast. Paige, I know you're awake. How many times do we have to- I'm sorry, Mom. I had to go. I have to follow my dream because dance is my passion. Please, just try to understand, I'm not trying to hurt you, but nothing else makes me feel the same way when I'm on stage. I'll see you when I get back from San Francisco. Love you. Where is Paige? She doesn't want breakfast again? Honey, shhh... just eat your food. Come on, Paige! Mom, did Paige go somewhere? Alex! Eat, please. Derek, how dare you do something without consulting me! Lynda, if it's about Paige, I totally took your side. Look who's awake! Thanks. Good reflexes. Where are we? Oh you know... just the middle of nowhere. So that means... A couple of hours away from San Francisco.

Luke, remember to connect your passé- Who do you think you are! Keep doing what you're doing. I'll be right back. Christina Kilroy? Let's go. How can I help you, Lynda? Paige is in San Francisco, and it's all your fault. How is it my fault exactly? Paige made her own choices- She's seventeen! She doesn't know what she wants! And she is not allowed to make the choice to run away. You're the one who put these ideas into Paige's head about being a ballerina. Deluding her into thinking that she has a future in it. When was the last time you saw Paige dance? When she was little. Let me show you something. I don't want to see anything. I just came here to- I don't even know why I'm here. Since you're already here, just watch it. That was beautiful, but it doesn't change anything. Come with me. We would like to see how you look together. Please take the stage. I have many really promising dancers. Paige has the potential to be great. It's beautiful. But I just don't want her to be disappointed later. We all have regrets. I'm sorry I have to go. So... how does it feel to be so great? Good. It feels really, really good. Well, you're not the only one with some great news... Oh yeah? I got into a music program. What? Where? L.A. Dylan! That's amazing! Congratulations! - Thank you. - For what? If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even be here. I know. I'm serious! Looks like you owe me a trip to the Grand Canyon. Really? You are still going on about that? So... you're back. Yes... I am. Crap. I thought you'd be at work. Well, I took the day off, since you said you'd be home this morning. Dylan just dropped me off. The tutor? He's a friend. How did the audition go? It went really well. Did you get in? Congratulations. Thanks. Glenn showed me your audition piece- You went to the studio? Oh yeah, and I made a huge scene. Not proud of it. But he showed me your video, and you're very talented, Paige. Thanks, Mom. Did you like California? It was a bit colder, but I could see myself living there. So am I grounded for life? No. But there is some immediate babysitting in your future as punishment. That sounds fair. Do we have anything to eat? Oh yeah. Go help yourself. I actually have to get going, so your punishment starts now, and Alex is in his room. Where are you going? I have to meet someone. I'm really glad you're home. Paige! - What's up? - I missed you. I missed you too. Paige... Yes? Will you show me how you dance? What? Mom won't stop talking how good you are. I wanna see. All right! Let's go! If you have any questions, please just ask. I think my client's offer is more than fair- I can read, you know. I can't believe this is finally happening. Did you change your mind because I backed you up? I mean, I never really cared about the ballet, I just- Well, I guess after you leaving and Paige running away, I finally understood one thing. I don't need someone in my life or in my kids' lives who would rather think about himself than support his own children. I am happy to be free of you, Derek. Have a great life. First position.
