The Panther Women Oh Satanasa, Queen of the Underworld, spirit of evil whom we adore, we, the creatures at your service, invoke you so that you may give us courage, strength and determination. 200 years ago Eloim, your high priest, was killed by the flaming sword of the druids. The act was carried out by a man called Pietrasanta, may his name be cursed. He cut the string of his earthly existence before his mission could be completed and condemned him to the shadows. Since then everyone who has borne that name has fallen before our vengeance. But our task is not yet complete, there still remain four members of the cursed Pietrasanta family. Eloim's mandate orders us to exterminate them before the full moon. They are condemned, no one can save them. Come in. - Hello - Oh, hello. Rubi, these are my uncle and cousin, Misters Pietrasanta. - Pleasure to meet you - Enchanted, miss. You had a splendid match. We came to congratulate you and invite you to dinner if you don't have anything plannned. We'd be delighted, isn't that right Ruby? Of course, as long as you can take us home to change. - It'd be our pleasure. - Of course! Magnificent dancer, isn't she? And quite a pretty girl. So cousin, tell us something: when are you getting married? I still haven't found someone brave enough to take the risk. And you? A widower with a daughter doesn't have too many prospects. However, I think matrimony might be just around the corner. Really? You played this pretty close to the vest, but I'm happy. Who's the lucky lady? It's my pleasure to present my fiancee. I called you Loreta because mortal danger is closing in on our family. I recieved this note under my door. Professor Rafael Piertsanta, the hour of vengance draws near. You and your family members will inexorably be annihilated one by one. The Panthers of Eloim. Panthers? I bet it's some friend's practical joke. That's what I told him. No, this has a logical reason that stretches back to the time of wizards. But father, how are you, a man of science, able to believe in those things? People laugh at magic, witchcraft and hexes but many truths lie in those things. There are many forces in the universe unknown to man. Very well uncle, but I don't see what all of that has to do with us. You will. The occult can span many fields and create signs and symbols for good, like this sword created by druids designed to fight against infernal powers, or others, like that one, that one, or that one, designed for evil. So what? When you hear the entire story you'll understand. This book from the 16th century deals with occult sciences. Listen: Eloim, warlock creator of the Panther sect. It is said that he still has female worshippers who continue to perform his strange rites. This leprous enchanter from the middle ages, who used a mask to hide his repugnant sickness, managed to call up the powers of hell in Croatia. Everything was set at the time so that the panther women could enslave mankind. To achieve this Eloim kidnapped innocent maidens to initiate them in his strange and bloodthirsty rites. But in America there was a man who discovered his secret, Hector Pietrasanta, the mage of Turin who knew the secrets of the alchemists and could read the language of the stars. Lifting the magic sword of the druids he warned the warlock to surrender. But the Eloim, ignoring the warning, tried to escape. Seeing this the mage hurled his weapon, impaling the warlock in the back. Eloim, feeling death approaching, pronounced a terrible curse. "Damned are you and your kin, one day I will come back to avenge myself on your descendants. I will come back for the last women of your line and take her back to my tomb with me, to reside forevermore in hell." And Hector Pietrasanta was an ancestor of ours? Yes, and I'm terrified that the curse may come true because your daughter is the last Pietrasanta Ramon. But this is childish, inconceivable! Don't talk about things you don't know. I'm telling you, they'll try to punish every one of us for that death. There's something I'd like to know Professor. What forbidden practices did those sorcerers carry out, do you know? Yes, it was an ancient rite in which they paid homage to Bast the cat or panther, goddess of the temple of Khufu. Her worshippers said they had the ability to turn into panthers to carry out acts of vengeance. Very well, now I'd like to work a bit. Alright Uncle, and don't worry so much, I'm sure nothing will happen. I'll take the girls home Father. - I'll see you tomorrow Uncle. - Until tomorrow. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Eloim, your first enemy will die this night. We are loyally carrying out your orders from beyond. His blood will help bring you back to life my lord. Damned warlock. Ms. Loreta Venus? Yes? We're from the Secret Service. Did something bad happen? I'm sorry to bring such bad tidings but your uncle... What happened to him? He died today in the early hours. The elder of the Pietrasantas has sown what he had reaped. Who is next mistress? Ramon Pietrasanta. Tongo will make sure that he meets his fate. With the blood of the second Pietrasanta the fatal circle will be complete and Eloim will come back to life. Forensic Medical Service Captain, have you found out what caused my father's death? Yes, that pathologist has given his report. And? It's strange, but it says he has claw marks, as if he had been attacked by a wildcat. A wildcat? Like what? It's stupid to say so, but it looks like it might have been a tiger or... a panther. The way the Professor died is incomprehensible. Do any of you have some idea or clue as to what happened? No, just something we talked about last night. Absurd things that have no reason to be repeated here. Please, let me know what this is about. Well... My uncle was an expert in occult sciences and he told us about Eloim, the sorcerous creator of the Panther sect who was killed by Hector Pietrasanta, an ancestor of ours, using the sword of the druids. Before he died Eloim swore to come back and exterminate all of Pietrasanta's descendants. And that's everything... Captain. Holy-! What a story? I'm breaking a cold sweat! It really is strange and unbelievable. I told you. Captain, I know what I'm going to ask is presumptuous but I would like to help you in your investigations. Even if you're opposed to this I won't leave your side. I appreciate your offer and I'm also think of getting the help of a friend. That's the best wrestler of all time! What do you know? What do you mean I don't know nothin? That's the best wrestler of all time! The best nothin'! Sit down already, let me watch the match pal! This is Angel, who's calling? This is Captain Arturo Diaz calling Angel. Hello Arturo, I'm glad to hear your voice. I need your help. Can I see you in your laboratory? Sure thing, I'll see you there in half an hour. Thank you. And if I ask for your help again like you've given so many times in the past is because I think behind all this there's something horrifying, supernatural. The death of Professor Pietrasanta which occurred under such mysterious circumstances seems to indicate so. The only thing that occurs to me is that those killers have trained a beast to kill. I hadn't thought of it, but it's possible. However we're totally in the dark, we don't have a single clue. If those killers mean to carry out their threat we have to keep an eye on the Pietrasantas. You watch the lady wrestlers and I'll guard Ramon. Agreed. It's been some time since I used the radio watch you invented. We'll use it once again to keep in contact. Once again we'll fight for good and justice my friend. Nice cape Angel. Yes, but don't think this is an everyday fabric, this cape is proof against bullets and fire. Doesn't seem like it, it's much too thin. But astoundingly strong, let me show you. It's a compound with barium-x, a new metal used by spacecrafts which can withstand the high friction of reentry into the atmosphere. A new weapon you'll use in your fight against crime. - See you soon Angel. - See you soon friend. Let me. Want a drink? Not right now. You don't know how bad I feel about your fathers death. Your presence and your love has been a great help. I love you very much Tongo. And now I have a surprise for you. Wait for me there and don't move, I won't be long. Look father! It's dead. What could've happened? Poor thing. What are you doing there? I was playing a joke on you, so I hid. Come, I want to introduce you to Paquita, my daughter. She's the one I've told you so much about. It's a pleasure Paquita. Paquita, what kind of matters are those? Paquita, get back here! Paquita! I'm very sorry about what happened. Don't worry, that's just how kids are. You'll see, later on I'll win her affection. Thanks, you're quite confident. - See you tomorrow love. - Until tomorrow. Why didn't you complete your mission Tongo? You know well we need the blood of Ramon Pietrasanta to resurrect Eloim. Forgive me, but I couldn't do it Mistress. When I was about to attack him he entered with his daughter. We can't touch that child. She belongs to Eloim. It is written. Yes Angel, I'm here. Arturo, I followed Ramon and his girlfriend, she's talking to some woman dressed in black, It's important you keep a watch on her. What's the address? Cedar 2015. See you soon. See you soon Arturo. Step on it. Kaim, Kaim, calling Kaim. Yes Mistress? Kaim, I'm being followed. I await your orders Mistress, what would you like us to do? Listen well to my orders: more than anything you mustn't use weapons, you could injure a Pietrasanta, understand? Yes maam. Hurry up, looks like she realized we're following her. She disappeared! It's not possible, I know this alley, there's no exit. She's got to be around here somewhere. Let's go look for her, she must've gone through that door. Now what? What's going on with you? I think it'd be better if I stayed to guard the car, right? This street is real dark, thieves could show up and take- You're coming with us chicken. - How brave. - Let's go. Freeze! Hold it there cowards! Who are you? They call me the Angel and I order you to leave those people alone! You dare to give us orders?! Is anyone hurt? No, I don't think so thanks to you. We really appreciate your help. Why do you cover your face? I serve justice and justice has no face. Will we see you again? Perhaps. Goodbye. What a man! And you? How are you Renecuatro? I'm all torn up princess, give me a foot, no no, I mean a hand. If it hadn't been for the Angel we would've had a bad time, isn't that right? Yes, he fights so well! He's extraordinary! Now events have proven that that woman is an accomplice in your uncle's death along with Ramon's girlfriend. Are you going to tell him? No, not until we're totally sure. For now someone will watch her. Let's go. If you could've seen how hard that boy whacked me, and I don't even think he was 60 centimeters tall! He might've been under 60 centimeters but he was over 40 years old. What?! You're saying he was a man dressed as a child? Well of course. A midget... Bastard, if I see him again I'm gonna grab him and- And what? That he has a lightning fast left and a right that hits like a bull. If you would've let us use our weapons that man, the Angel, would no longer exist. I feared you might hurt the lady wrestler. All the members of that damned family must die at our hands. But as soon as you see that masked wrestler alone you can annihilate him any way you please. It'd be for the best, that man can become a great danger for us all. I'm sure he and the police are watching us. We'll set a trap for them and then you'll have a chance to get back at him Kaim. When the moon rises we'll start the rite of resurrection. We only need the second Pietrasanta's blood, and Tongo will bring it to us. Hello? Ramon? Yes dear, how are you? I know we don't have a date, but I feel so bored and alone tonight. If you don't have too much work could you come by for me? Alright, just let me finish a letter and I'll be there in 20 minutes. It's a promise. So long love. Step on it. He went in here, follow him! You two go to the other side of the house, - you, follow me! - Alright. There he is! Burn the hay, let's go! Shoot! Let's go! How beautiful the night is, and how fresh the air is here. It's true. Shall we get out? Why not? I'd like to run through the country and feel free, like a savage animal. What strange ideas you have. Don't you know? Every person has an inclination towards something. With me, I'm irresistably drawn to forests and infinite open spaces. Maybe in another life or another region I was a wildcat. Woman or cat, I love you just the same. Are you sure? Do you have a cigarette? I left them in the car, I'll go back for them. Tongo, answer me Tongo! Answer me! Answer me! You father had to take a long voyage. And why didn't he say goodbye to me? He couldn't, believe me, but he told me that he would love you forever, that you were what he loved most in the world. Will he be gone long? I don't know dear. Now I'm alone. No, you won't be alone, you'll be with me. We'll have alot of fun, right? Yes. Alright, now go play for a while. The curse is being carried out inexorably. First my uncle, then my cousin. The next victim will be me or Paquita. Don't let superstition get the best of you Loreta. And what else can be done afte everything that's happened? It's obvious that someone is trying to destroy your family but it's someone from this world, not from beyond as you're inclined to believe. You can be sure that Tongo was the cause of your cousin's death for reasons we still don't know. If those men, surely her accomplices, hadn't attacked me I would've tried to save him, but sadly I arrived too late. And thanks to my protective cape I escaped safely from the hay in which I had fallen. Agreed Angel, but we must recognize there's something supernatural in these deaths. How is it possible that two men, in the middle of the city, were torn apart by savage beasts? We've already investigated the wildlife preserves and the circuses and none report any missing tigers or panthers, so what or who is the cause of these deaths? Oh great mistress of hell, the moment has arrived; give us the power so that your loyal and beloved servant the supreme high priest gains new life with this blood from the second of the Pietrasantas. Eloim, beloved lord and master, you've come back to life. This same night you will go for the Pietrasanta girl so the curse will be complete. Oh you piece of boiled tripe, didn't you notice? You went into the well! Well, I guess it was a bad move to go in to the well. I'm out, I can't do anything with this mental midget. You'd be better off playing marbles! Well, at marbles I'm very, very bad. And at this? Well, I'm worse at this. Alright, I think it's time for bed, it's late. Three men are keeping watch outside. Oh, and lock all the doors. Well, until tomorrow my amazon. See you tomorrow worm. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Good evening. - Good evening. - How's it going Angel? - Hello Arturo. - Anything new? - No, nothing. What's up? I see you brought your men. Yes, these agents will watch the house all night. Tomorrow they'll be relieved by others. You should leave Locario here too. No sir, not me, the cold bothers my rheumatitis, see, just with this bit out here look how it's left me. Cut it out already, what you have is a bad case of yellow belly. Geez, I don't know how you became an agent. Necessity brother, necessity. Arturo, just for peace of mind I'd like to leave a radio watch with one of your men. I think it's a good idea. In case there's a problem call me. Press this button, alright? - Yes sir. - Agreed. Goodnight, I'll see you tomorrow. Later buddy! Angel. Yes? Who's calling? We were attacked by a man...a monster. He killed...my partners..and..and... What's happening? Go on! Once more the cursed sword of the druids gets in our way! How did it come to be in the girls room? I don't understand. The old professor knew what was to happen and astutely placed it there thinking it would protect her as it did. Eloim could do nothing before the magic weapon. Then what we need to do is seperate her from the sword. Yes, but how? The Qaballah of Astaroth says it must be Eloim or one of us that brings the child, and the same problem will always come up. I think I have it! Listen to my orders. ...and that's all in international news. Now in sports news, two masked wrestlers who are known as The Shadows have sent a formal challenge to the champions Loreta Venus and her American partner the Golden Rubi to a tag team match. Loreta, Rubi, you've already read the Shadows' declaration? - Yes. -And will you take part in this match? Of course, we're professionals and accept any challenge that comes our way. When will the fight be? Once we sign the contract the promoters set the date. Very well, a picture please. This is precisely what I expected, the trap was set and they took the bait. Surely they'll seperate the girl from that damned sword. What do you say? Are you ready? Yes Mistress. I'm sure you'll have no problem tearing those wrestlers apart, you're more agile, stronger, and you have claws! Those wrestlers are late. I'm sure they're doing it on purpose to make us nervous. Stay calm cutie, don't let yourself be psyched out, remember I'm taking care of you below the ring! - Anything new? - Nothing sir. This lull bothers me, I'm surprised they haven't launched a new attack against Loreta or the girl. To prevent that I've decided that Paquita won't leave my side for a single moment. Here come the Shadows. There's something about those women I don't like. They're really sinister. Loreta, Rubi, it's my pleasure to introduce the Shadows. Very pleased. Very well, let's sign the contract. I'm almost certain that one of those masked women they're going to wrestle with is Tongo. What makes you think that? I could be wrong, but those green feline eyes belong to Tongo. It's true, no wonder I thought I recognized that look. Don't tell me they're the ones that tear apart the victims because that's really some tearing apart there! Certainly not, but they might have the tamed beast we're looking for. What could they be planning with this match? We'll find out and play their game. Are you still determined to fight them now that we know who they are? - Of course. - Now more than ever. Very well, you'll be protected by the police though I don't think you'll be in any danger. I'll keep investigating in the meantime, and as a cautionary measure you should take the girl with you to the arena dressing rooms, we don't know if this is some trick to attack her. Sensational Women's Match 2 out of 3 falls with no time limit You're worried. I have to confess that for the first time I'm afraid, there's something about those women that terrifies me. Come in. - Ready? - We're coming. - Good luck. - You too. There's a girl sleeping inside, don't let anyone in for any reason, understood? - Understood. - Yes miss. A stellar match, two out of three falls with no time limit! In this corner, Loreta Venus, and the Golden Rubi! In this other, the Shadows! Those wrestlers won't last much longer, the panther women will tear them apart at 10 pm. They think we have a wildcat, the idiots don't know that Tongo and Eva turn in to panthers. What's that noise? What happened? The Angel boss, I caught him listening through the skylights. I wanted to take care of him but he cheesed it. Bastard, he escaped. What are those chicks doing, they're not wrestling! Get them! They're the panther women! - Where'd the women in black go? - That way. - I'm sure they're here in the garden. - At your service Captain. They must be hidden around here, let's go look for them. If your life is in danger, shoot to kill. Let's split up, you go that way, you stay here, we'll go this way. I'll go this way. What happened? I shot at her, I'm sure she's mortally wounded. My partner was attacked by that beast. Take him to the hospital, we'll keep looking. Look, there's a trail of blood. Let's follow it. Angel, over here! Bastards! You're all bastards! You've killed her, but her sacrifice won't be in vain because this night the girl, the last Pietrasanta, will also die! - What did you say witch? - Paquita! - The girl's not here! - No one's come in or out that door. They came through here, there's some bloodstains. Where did you take the girl? Talk witch! You couldn't make me talk, not even with torture! Damn you! Calm down, we won't get anywhere that way. You should resign yourselves to the inevitable, there's no one and nothing that can fight against the powerful dark forces. Hurry, we should take this woman home! What for? There's no time to explain but I feel that Paquita is in terrible danger. Let's go, hurry! The sword of the druids! Take it away! Talk! Where did they take the girl? Please, take it away, take it away! She's...in... - the graveyard. - In what section? In the back, on the left, there's a great crypt that belonged to the Cagliostro family. Now go, take that 1000 times damned sword from my sight! Did you hear? Of course but how did you find this out? I remembered that on that night the Professor said that the sword of the druids was the only thing that could fight against the dark forces. Oh Eloim, great master, forgive me, I have betrayed you. Only death can free me from my great sin. Careful! There's nothing to be done. Let's go. Look. This is the other panther, she's dead. -That must be the crypt. - Let's go. We're going inside? There's no one here. Could that woman have lied? I don't understand, I'm sure she was telling the truth. Well, you saw that there's no one here and if there's no one here then we should leave, right? Hold on, I'm still not sure. He's so stubborn. We should go, right? You're right, you got your way. Let's go. See, I told you. - Listen! - What? No no no, it's nothing, let's go home! It's coming from the coffin, help me! It's useless, it must open some other way. Watch out! Well, now everything's done. Yes, it's the end of a terrible nightmare that never seemed to finish. I'd like to give my thanks to- He disappeared! He left before we could tell him how grateful we are. Who is the Angel? The Angel is a hero, a true hero of the kind that we need now, those that fight for the good of humanity. He defended us against a sect of assassins in silence like it should be, meting out justice from the shadows, ignored by the whole world.
