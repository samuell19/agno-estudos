2,500 years ago, a monster started opening the door that bridges the human realm to hell in order to make humans suffer. But the Buddha appeared before the monster and pulled out the Red Eye and the Black Eye, which were the source of his power. However, both eyes escaped the Buddha's hands and started to run away from the Buddha. The Black Eye was caught by the Buddha soon enough and was locked inside a sarira casket. But the Red Eye, on the other hand, managed to get away by hiding inside people's bodies and running away for seven nights. Then, on the eighth night, the Red Eye stopped and turned around, thinking it had come far enough. But upon realizing that the path it had been on was actually a bridge consisting of seven stepping stones over a narrow, shallow stream, the Red Eye learned that it could never escape from the Buddha. So it faked surrender and voluntarily got into a sarira casket. After sealing them inside the caskets and locking them up in the vast deserts of the West and the steep cliffs of the East, the Buddha said to his nameless disciples, "You must make sure they never meet again." "That is your fate." OCTOBER 2005- INDIA-PAKISTAN BORDER This is it. I think I've figured out the location of the sarira casket. If it is here in the desert, I can finally prove the legend of the Diamond Sutra is true. Okay. Bring that ladder in. The ancient relic is said to prove the legend of the Diamond Sutra. To confirm authenticity, scientists will test both relics. Results of the carbon dating have come back negative. Authorities now suspect Professor Kim Jun-cheol deliberately forged the relic. Professor Kim denies all the allegations and vows to fight the charges, saying people will know the truth eventually. ...shunned by even his closest friends in academia. Due to Professor Kim's bizarre actions... AFTER THE RELIC FORGERY CASE ...it looks like the case will remain a mystery. 1ST SUPER BLUE BLOOD MOON IN 35 YRS 14 YEARS LATER RED MOON TO BE SEEN TONIGHT TOTAL LUNAR ECLIPSE FROM 1 A.M. FOR 2 HOURS The sarira casket is fake? The legend is a lie? How stupid can you people be? I tried... I tried to tell you... I didn't lie about any of it. You people are the liars. You idiots! The legend was true and I can prove it. "Do not awaken what lies asleep here." "On the night of the Red Moon, the Red One will be roused from sleep and return to the Black One." "When they are reunited, the world will turn into hell, where only pain and darkness exist." They'll know I was telling the truth when I open the door to hell. I wasn't wrong. I couldn't have been wrong. Seonhwa, it is time. THE FIRST DAY Hey, get this stuff outta here. Let's move a little faster, huh? - What did he use to do? - I heard he was a monk. - Come on. - I'm telling you, seriously. A Buddhist monk? No way. BUK-SAN, GWANGJU VOW OF SILENCE: SILENT MEDITATION Cheongseok. Cheongseok, do you know that you have been here almost two years now? But it is difficult not to talk? I'm sure. When we are forced to be quiet, only then can we truly hear. WHEN CAN I STOP? You can talk again when I say you can talk again. Follow me. Cheongseok. Do you remember the story about the monster? WHY DIDN'T THE BUDDHA GET RID OF THE MONSTER THEN? No one can get rid of it, not even the great Buddha himself. But he found another way to stop the monster by taking its eyes and separating them, Locking one away in the Far West, and the other in the Far East. For the Red One he created a desert, far away from all life, hidden deep in the ground. The Black One, he locked away in the East, behind rocky mountains and steep cliffs. And then the Buddha sent two disciples, a virgin and a nameless monk, so they could stand guard by the mountains and cliffs, and make sure the monster would never come back again. But there will come a time. The Red Eye in the West will meet a helper. On the night of the Red Moon, the Eye will be freed. And then it will come, one by one, through seven stepping stones for seven nights to find its other half. But if the Eyes are reunited on the eighth night... Then the monster will be unstoppable. So it falls upon us to make sure that doesn't happen. We will have to remove one of the stepping stones, should it come to that. Take any one stone out of the path, and the Red Eye won't be able to reunite with the Black One. Cheongseok. Did you forget to clean? I can see dirt on the Urna. Please wipe it off right away. CHILGOK, NORTH GYEONGSANG PROVINCE Damn, too small. Huh? What the... THE SECOND DAY - What does he do? - Not sure. He said he's a professor. - How did you meet him? - Through this meditation group. Well, they call it a meditation group, but it's more like a cult. I don't know. I thought it'd be helpful. - Did you do it, then? Was it helpful? - Sure. At least a little bit. Got a free checkup out of it. - What kind of checkup? - It was no big deal. They just ran a few tests on me, took some blood. So you went for the checkup? No, of course not. They actually paid me to keep coming back. Would you say no to that? - They paid you? - Mmm-hmm. FOUR SEASONS Did you have a nightmare? Cheongseok. Good or bad, the dreams don't stay with us forever. We must try to hold on to them. We must not let them sway us. The time has come. Find Seonhwa. SEONHWA Tell him... the monster is here. THE THIRD DAY FOUR SEASONS - WELCOME He just arrived. Okay, copy that. Let me know when he's up. I'll bring in a coroner and cleanup crew. Perimeter secured... Hey, did we get a photo of this shoeprint over here? - No, I don't think so. - Well, why not? Did you see it? What is this shit? Hey, this should go all the way around, don't you see? - Oh. - Such morons. - Who called it in? - Hotel owner. - Any witnesses? - No other guests at the hotel. On weekdays, it's like a ghost town around here. - Hey, hey, over your shoes. - Oh, please. The owner of the motel was asleep at the time of the incident. Did the camera get anything? Oh, yeah, right. About 11:45 last night, the victim or, uh, suspect... What should I call 'em? What do you mean what should you call 'em? You stupid? See for yourself. The body in the shower is the male. But the female was gone. Female? Yeah, this guy checked in together with a woman named Seo Gyeong-suk. CCTV has her leaving the hotel right after the incident. Where'd you get her name from? She left all her stuff behind, including her purse. Have you put out an APB out on her? Yes, sir. What about him, there? That's the one I was talking about before. Cameras show he was fine when he walked into the room, but... So I guess he's both the suspect and the victim. SEONHWA Shouldn't we let Seonhwa know? - Do you know where he is? - Yes. - Don't. - But Master Hajeong is... Let's not bother him. But then what do we do about the funeral? We'll keep it simple. He would have wanted it that way. Vow of silence? For how long? You know you could stop now that he's gone. DO YOU KNOW WHERE MONK SEONHWA IS? Mmm. I WILL BE BACK BEFORE THE FUNERAL - CHEONGSEOK Bhante Seonhwa. He's no monk. He's not? No, he's nothing. If he's not a monk, he can't help us. How much longer do we have to wait? You have to help us! THE FOURTH DAY DAEJEON STATION 4-91 EUNHAENG-DONG, JUNG-GU DAEJEON We found Seo Gyeong-suk inside the stall, dead, just like the other one. Let's think about this. These two check in together. This guy comes in later. Now, if we had found these two dead, we'd have a much simpler case, wouldn't we? But we find him. And she leaves the hotel in one piece. Doesn't call anyone, leaves her stuff. Then today, we find her dead in a park restroom. Grotesque and deformed, just like the body at the motel. So what happened here? I want theories. You, what's yours? Mmm... - Me? - What do you think? Uh, well... It... It's a weird one and we have no clue why the corpses look like that. Yeah? But I have a friend who, when they had a case they couldn't solve, he, uh... - I don't know. Never mind. - Just spit it out. - Come on, what did your friend do? - Well... that one was a tough case. They spent some time trying to catch a rapist, so eventually he ended up going to a psychic. Psychic? He told me she was very good. I'm sure she is. At stealing. CHIEF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FOR PROMOTION What are you going to do about Dong-jin? You need to pull the trigger. Don't you think? Uh-huh. It's hard enough with the ones that don't have his issues. He's got the limp. He can barely see anything. When are you gonna do it? I got so mad at him yesterday, I told him to quit. But he said he'd have to talk to you first. It's not your fault he's like that. You have to stop blaming yourself for the accident. Keeping him around only makes it worse for the others. It's time to let him go, okay? Why does he always take this with him? Maybe he gives it to his dog? Coming up next, a man in his sixties who was arrested after assaulting his neighbor... MONK SEONHWA? MONK HAJEONG HAS PASSED AWAY. HE SAID TO TELL YOU THAT THE MONSTER IS HERE. I'M SORRY. I LOST THE THING MONK HAJEONG LEFT BEHIND. Miss, is everything okay? Hey, we met in that meditation group, right? But what's wrong? What happened to you? VIRGIN SHAMAN Your eyes are still filled with anger. I thought I should see you, so I came with the boy. You know what I've told you before. You know what you must do, help the souls cross over. It is your fate until the day you die, Seonhwa. There are thousands of souls counting on you. Waiting on you to ascend. Now he's here, using the stepping stones, one by one. You must find the one we know. The last stepping stone. The woman. The virgin. You must find her before he does. And then... kill her. It is the fate of those who stand guard. When the time comes, do it. VIRGIN SHAMAN 45-12 SINPUNG-DONG, PALDAL-GU, SUWON TO MR. PARK JIN-SU THE FIFTH DAY Wait up! Thank you so much. VOW OF SILENCE Where are you headed? What is that? What's your destination, sir? A woman in her forties, and the lead suspect in the Daegu motel murders, was found dead inside a park bathroom in Daegu. Police are combing through CCTV footage to retrace her steps in hopes of finding witnesses. Sources say the police think Seo may have had an accomplice. I can't accept that, but... can I maybe come with you, instead? Master told me that we have to stay together, no matter what. 46-9 SINPUNG-DONG, PALDAL-GU, SUWON By the way, I keep thinking we've met somewhere before? I feel very comfortable around you for some reason. Like we knew each other before. And I'm not saying this just because you bought me brand-new shoes... and all this great food. I swear it's not just 'cause of that. I just mean... Your life is full of sin. Searching for someone? Well... The woman back at the store told me you were looking for a psychic. I heard she moved to Daegu a year ago. I don't know the exact address. But what I do know is that if you go there, you die. How can it be unknown? The NFS just sent back the autopsy and toxicology reports, but cause of death is still listed unknown. Well, what does the report actually say? Okay, so there are a few things... Oh, Jesus, come on, just read me exactly what it says. "The bodies decomposed overnight resulting in severe tissue damage..." Wait, what does this... The hell is this shit about now? Is that all? It also says each victim had a hole in the skull. But that they need to run more tests to figure out why. Are you sure this is the official report? You didn't call in some backwoods private investigator, right? No, but get this, I was looking at the corpses again today, and it's bizarre, but... Remember the psychic I was talking about the other day? - I went to see her... - Yeah, I already told you to drop that. Did you put the suspect on the lookout list yet? - Yes, sir. - And the victim? Twenty-eight-year-old female, reported missing two days ago. Went out to meet a friend and never came back. - Apparently she didn't have a job. - No one has a job after they're dead. Huh? Jesus, that smell. - Some gloves? - Oh, yeah. WHERE ARE WE GOING? WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? God, how can you always be this annoying? It's a bus full of empty seats. Why do you have to sit by me? - Just say it. - Can I really talk again? Thank you, Bhante Seonhwa. - It's a relief to... - Don't call me that ever again. What? Why not? Then what should I call you? DAEGU BUS TERMINAL I am going to take my own life to pay for what I did. I know it's a lot to ask of you, but please, look after my son, Jeong-hun. He has no one else left. I can never apologize enough to Mr. Park Jin-su and his family, but I am sorry. Kill him! You fool! THE SIXTH DAY Where'd he go? Bhante. I thought you'd left. When I woke up, I couldn't find you and... I was worried you might... So Master Hajeong actually... told you to stay with me? - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. The motel, the restroom. Happy? You could do this yourself. Look, it's a double burger now. Listen. See this area? We need to visit every single psychic in here. We'll split. The park restroom is just over there, so you could start here and work your way toward... That's one banana. You gotta be kidding me. Stay alert and make sure to meet me back here at sundown. You like that? Yeah, even better than I remember. I had it once before when Master Hajeong took me to the... GYOBANG GIL 91 GYOBANG 2-GIL 37- 141 GEUMJEONGSA WOMAN'S DEAD BODY FOUND IN SEWER BY DAEGU TUNNEL However, due to the state of decomposition the body was found in, authorities believe the incident happened quite some time ago. VIRGIN SHAMAN What? - Where are you, sir? - At the scene, why? - Chief's looking for you. - All right, then. Tell him I'll head in. Responding to the 10-34 call. We're on our way. Hang on. Can you show me some ID? Hey, real quick. - Yeah? - Need you to look up someone. Park Jin-su, 750121-1046899. Patrol 7 here. Yeah, we've got another dead body over by Daegu High School. Uh, not much. Just a fine for causing a disturbance in court. Okay, thanks. One more thing. I'm gonna need to look in your backpack. I'm sorry, but have we met somewhere before? DAEGU JUNGBU POLICE STATION You all right? What do you got? Okay, so, first off, the body found by the high school? Turns out it's the delivery guy from the tunnel. Same thing, found decomposed. What the hell is happening here? Okay, look here. NAME: PARK JIN-SU Your little sparring partner used to work construction. But he ended up leaving the job two days before the first case. So I found his office manager and called him up. Turns out, back in 1999, his wife and his five-year-old daughter were killed in a car accident. The other woman was driving drunk, but when she went to the court, she got her sentence reduced. So that explains the disturbance in court. "2005, Assault"? What's that? After the accident, this guy goes and becomes a monk. A Buddhist monk? He ends up joining a temple in Gwangju. And apparently, it's known for exorcism. - More psychics, then? - I didn't... What I meant was more... He's kinda like an exorcist... Stop messing around already. Just get to the point. But this is the point. He beat an actual demon out of the person. That's a poor excuse. But they did reach a settlement. What about this fraud charge? Well, after the Jogye Order of Monks helped him settle the assault case, they actually found Park had never even been a real monk. Is that so? Simply put, if he was a real monk, they would have known about it. So in reality, we have no idea who he is. So that means we're back to square one. DAEGU JUNGBU POLICE PRECINCT MAP Anyway, this other thing happened this morning... - Hey, Dong-jin. - Huh? Shut up. Come on. Oh, wait. Before I forget... Here. What's this? Some underwear and socks. My wife bought extra for you. Oh, wow, that's so nice of her. I got something else. Take this, too. What's this? Remember that psychic I told you about? It's from her. - Jesus Christ. - Hey, wait! Don't destroy it. Do you know how much I paid for that talisman? Not just money, I bled for this. She used my own blood to give it power. Fuck. How did you ever get hired to do this job in the first place, huh? Just keep it on you. It wards off evil, you know? And who knows? Maybe it'll help you catch the killer. Hey, why don't we get rid of detectives altogether? Let the psychics do the job for us. Bro, what do you always say to me? "It takes everything we have to catch these guys." How do you feel? You better? I'd say so. Legs are better now. Eyes, too. The light has turned green. You may now cross. Hey, you really don't need to worry about me, you know? It was an accident. Not your fault. When I jumped in the water, desperate to end it all, who was there to pull me out? In fact... If you hadn't saved me from that, I honestly... I wouldn't... I wouldn't be a detective now. That's why I have to keep at it. I owe you that much. MAP OF DAEGU You didn't see a female psychic anywhere in here? What about this place here? Or maybe over here? This is where you were, isn't it? Click there. To the right. Zoom in there. But wait, I haven't told you about what else I saw. What is this? The second he heard about the body on the radio, his whole face changed. - Your pen. - Oh. This is the tunnel. The high school. And the restroom. No new missing person reports in the past few days, but there is one runaway. Except it's nothing new. She's a repeat offender. She usually comes back home after a week or two. Her mother always throws a fit, though. Last time, she was here bawling, screaming, saying her daughter was going to kill herself. Kill herself? Yeah. She had just joined some suicide website and then took off. But from what I recall, I think she must have come back just a few days later. Wasn't it? But it wasn't a suicide website. Remember? It just turned out to be a meditation group. But it was for people who had attempted suicide. Hmm. Hmm. Are you sure that's what you saw? You're positive? What was that thing? Listen carefully. You need to leave right now. If anyone asks, say you don't know me. We've never met, you've never seen me. Tell them you don't know me at all. How could I say that after everything that's happened? I could still go with you... - You need to go back now. - Don't make me. I came all this way. Whatever it is you're about to do, you don't have to leave me behind. You think it's easy... to murder someone? Because that's what I have to do. Do you understand now? Who... Who do you have to kill? - The girl I saw in the alley? - Not her, she can't be killed now. Who, then? You understand I have to stop it. And if the monster's back, she's as good as dead already. - I don't get it. - And I don't have time to explain. I have to... stop him now, no matter what it takes. That is my role to play here. I'm sorry. - Are you coming or what? - No, you go ahead. Okay. One more thing. - I received another call earlier today. - What call? Apparently, this morning, another dead body was found in the Chilgok mountains. They did tell me it must have been old, but I'm not so sure. One of ours? Based on the description, I think it definitely sounded like it could be one of ours. - Did you check it? - Of course I did. Phone records, e-mails, bank statements, the whole deal. I'm on it, boss. Come on, you know you can always count on me, eh? Go! We gotta get out of here. Come on! You have to come with me. Please. - Yeah. - So about the body in Chilgok. - It's definitely one of ours. - What did you find? Name, Kim Jun-cheol. Anthropologist. He forged some kind of relic a while back, which caused a whole scandal. He left academia and started, get this, a Buddhist meditation website. But only for suicidal people. So that's the one. All of our dead bodies were members. They're all in this photo from an in-person meetup in Daegu. Except for two of them, all of these people were found in the rapidly-decomposed state. But the other two people I see in that photo... - Who are they? - Well, it's... It's almost hard to believe. One's the runaway girl we heard about back at the station. And the other is the psychic I went to see. The one who made the talisman. They have to be connected. - And where are you now? - At the office. Okay, check out the psychic. Send me the address now. And make sure you meet me there as soon as you can. Gotcha, bastard. Not gonna lose you again. You can run. But you can't hide. OM Coward. He's done for, now. Your life is over. You are nothing. Fine then. Just ignore my call. Didn't I come this way last time? It should be here. Whoa, what the... That looks like... - Are you okay? - It's him, it's him! Don't move. Drop your weapon. Put it down! Got an emergency call coming in from the redevelopment district. This is Patrol 8. We're on our way. We're close by. Heading over there right now. That way. This is not where you'll die. Go to Buk-San. Hey, you two. What's going on over here? Cut him off! Go! Patrol 8 to dispatch, we need backup now. Are you listening? Take them. Gwangju for two. THE SEVENTH DAY Hmm? Master Hajeong? GO TO BUK-SAN AND YOU WILL FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. Gwangju, please. I can't go all the way out there this late. - Okay, then just take me to the terminal. - Sure. Taxi! Taxi! - Gwangju! - Last bus already left. First bus is in three hours. GO TO BUK-SAN AND YOU WILL FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. I need to find the last stepping stone. The woman, the virgin. But... You're afraid? Of course you are. Everyone runs away when faced with fear. Pity. All of your souls have left you. That only means one thing. It's already done. The Black Eye has already stepped on the last stone. They must have thought you would die soon. You're all that's left now. You cannot run away from this duty. It is your fate to see it through to the end. It transferred to you the second I died. And it will be the same if you die. Your fate will pass to a new successor. Bhante Seonhwa! So... what will you do now? Sir? I'm sorry. Why did my mom die? Gwangju. That makes no sense! He has a wife and a kid. He would never do something like that. Calm down. We're looking into it. Maybe someone took his gun and his car. Move. PLATE NUMBER: 23S 7657 Buk-San, please. Because he told us to keep it simple. Don't you think we should do what he... Let me call you back. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? Stop! How does it feel for you to know, old man, that you have failed so spectacularly now? Any witnesses? A few said they heard the commotion. But no one could really see anything. That's just great. We need to prove this wasn't Dong-jin. Yes, sir. Are you getting tired? My name's Cheongseok, by the way. May I ask your name? My name? Ae-ran. Who's here with you? When I first saw her, I didn't know she was a ghost. But no one else there could even see that she was with us. That night, she followed me home. And told me what had happened to her. She had been abused and only saw life as a curse. She just wanted it to end. Then one day, a man came, like a savior. Come with me. But happiness always seems to be... short-lived. Liars! Why would you say that? I was right. I know I was right. The prophecy is clear. "The red-eyed maid will bewitch the virgin." I have to find this maid. Someone who will give herself as a sacrificial offering. Do you think I'm crazy? I know no one else will believe me, but you will, won't you? The virgin who guards the path is the last stepping stone. Someone will have to sacrifice. Someone who can bewitch the virgin. Someone. I know no one else will believe me, but you will, won't you? When someone you love tells you something, you want to believe it's true, even when... you know it isn't. Maybe that's why life is such a tragedy. - It came back. - Or maybe it never left. Gwangju for two. Buk-San, please. The other detective? He was here. He came to me a few days ago. I made him a talisman with his blood. How could he have known that he was already destined to die, too? The whole meditation group, no one there realized the awful truth. That their deaths had been written in stone a long time ago. They were only alive because they didn't die when they tried to kill themselves before. But he brought them all together there. How he found them, I don't know. He took a blood sample from each one of them to create the stepping stones. So that the Red One could find them by the smell of their blood. And pass through them one by one to return to the Black One. And then... Stop it! Don't you see? The other detective, he's the last stepping stone now. The girl kept me here so I couldn't escape. Ae-ran promised me I could live if I just let him take my place. But he already wanted to kill himself. He already did, he wasn't... You are the one who made this possible. Don't you see? He was supposed to die, but you pulled him out of the water. None of this would have happened if you had just let him die. Why would you come to me when this is on you? Get out. Buk-San is waiting. There's only one way this ends. You have to go to that mountain. It's either him or us. Leave me. And where would I go? Follow my lead. Got it? We're gonna set a trap. I'll be its bait. You will follow my exact instructions, no matter what he tries. Your clothes will be your talisman. They'll protect you. That should do it. Go to Buk-San. You'll find what you're looking for. I wouldn't be a detective now. I owe you that much. DAEGU What will happen when the sarira casket is opened? The Black Eye and the Red Eye will reunite as one. What do the Eyes symbolize? When you live in fear, waiting for the unknown, that's anxiety. When you live in sadness, dwelling on the pain of the past, that's agony. The eyes of the anxious are dark and have no life. The eyes of agony burn hot with anger. So anxiety is black and agony is red. One or the other would be enough to make us suffer forever. So what do you think will happen if they are allowed to become one again? What kind of world will this be if we're eternally stuck between anger and despair? Agony and anxiety? That is a world of endless night. That is... a world... That is hell. THE EIGHTH DAY No running from this now. I'm his last target. Once he's inside the trap, he'll take over my body. That is when you must strike. You are foolish. Do you want to know why? You made a miscalculation. A big one. I need the guard to open the sarira. And you, as Monk Hajeong's successor, should be the one I need. And you would be. Except... you decided to run away from this place, didn't you? Which means that you're no longer the guard here, are you? OM Which means, you serve no purpose. You're useless. So... kill yourself. Ae-ran... find him. Ae-ran! OM Dong-jin! Are you there? Run! Save yourself! You must go! It is you. You idiot. What the fuck is wrong with you? - You have to get out. You have to run. - Dong-jin. Go away! Stop! Go! No! Please! Leave me! Dong-jin. What a pest you are. Ho-tae. - Come with me. - Go... to... hell. Not the kid. Leave him. You can have me. Now you care for him, do you? He's the son of the woman who killed your family. That hatred still burns inside you. Let's go. I can't... reach... the light. Family is the most important thing in the world. You've suffered so much without them. This is your last chance to put an end to it now. It's not too late to make it right again. An eye for an eye. Like that night when you left the temple. Take my life. Take it like they took yours. And then your suffering, your pain, your hell, will all disappear. You gave up your last chance to put an end to your pent-up anguish and resentment. You are still unbelievably foolish. OM Do it! Son... I'm sorry for everything. We wouldn't know light if not for the darkness. The deeper our sorrow, the greater our appreciation for nirvana will be. What is our life... if not like the leaf on the tree. Vibrant now, destined to grow frail and then fall. Like shadows, dewdrops, and lightning. It is truly fleeting. But even the most trivial moments in our predetermined fate are meaningful as pieces of the whole. Seonhwa. Now that you've found that meaning, it is time for you to wake up from your dark dream.
