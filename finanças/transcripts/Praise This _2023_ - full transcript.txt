That's what family's for, right? -Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Just like my baby sister. Hey. This is the best day of my life. Everything's going to change. My sister-cousin is here. JESS [squeals]: Sam! - Oh, boy. Oh, my gosh. How was your drive? I love your style. Where'd you get your jacket from? - Is it vintage? - Hmm? It's happening. - What's happening? Us. I've always wanted a sister, and here you are. Well, we're cousins, Jess. Cousins, sisters. It's the South. It doesn't even matter. Your boobs look amazing. I'm a "C" now. What size are you? I'm a "B." Really? - They look like a "C." - Really? It's the push-up. I got to get one of those. Are you going to Spelman? You applied, right? Let's get this inside, ladies. I keep asking myself: What would her mother do about all this? - I miss her. - Yeah, me, too. It's been a year since she passed. But, you know, you did the right thing getting Sam out of L.A. But I can see she's a little tense about being here, too. But don't worry. I'm a psychologist. It's what I do. - Let a pro handle it. Careful with my floors. Just had 'em waxed. Okay. Sam, why don't we discuss why you're here. I would love to, Uncle Larry. - I really would. My dad right here thought it'd be a good idea to kick me out of the house and drop me off in the middle - of this backwards-ass... Please forgive me, Auntie. The South. - It's my life. - Oh, let's talk about her life. Let's talk about it. She told me that she wanted to take a gap year. Now, do you know what that is? 'Cause I damn sure didn't know. It's a year where you don't do shit. Oh, here we go again. I was working on my music. I was being productive. -Oh, no. Promised me that she'd apply to colleges. Showed me filled-out applications. She never turned them in. The devil's in the details. Oh, yeah, and then she got arrested. - It was a misdemeanor. - Oh, was it? How many times do I have to tell you André is my music producer? Oh, so the studio got raided for what, songs? What, do you think that I'm stupid? Yes, I do. It's written right there. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Time-out. - Right there. - You better watch your mouth. Hey, hey, hey. Time-out, time-out. Why don't we just focus on the positive here, all right? There's no positive here. - We've come up with a plan. Mm-hmm. - You want to tell them, baby? - Yeah, babe. Right, so you know I work at Georgia State. Well, I called in a few favors, and they're willing to admit you in the spring. - Oh, my goodness, really? - Yes. I'm not going. Well, [sighs] Sam, just think about it. You'd be near Jess at Spelman. Maybe you two could even get an apartment together. Oh, no. Jess could finally move out. Put some of her masterpieces on her own walls. Painting is how I process grief from my beloved departed cat Cheddar. Look, you are grown. And I can't force you to stay. Plus, I know you. You gonna get your money up and do what you want to anyway. But I'm telling you, L.A. is not for you right now, Sam. Guess what. You're not for me either. Yeah. - Sam, listen... Sam. - Goodbye. Whatever. Um, where's my room? It's upstairs. I'll show you. I don't know why I did that. Just go. Sam, wait. Welcome, welcome, sister-cousin. This is my room, but I want you to think of it as one communal safe space. Oh. And the best part is we are connected. Think of this as a canal, giving birth to our cousin-sisterhood. You play drums? I'm sort of a multitalented artist. Drums aren't really my strength. So, this is your room. I put out some fresh flowers. And there's a picture of me and you with your mom when we were kids. Remember? Oh. - Okay, I guess you're tired. Okay, so I'll just go. Good morning! I made you coffee. How many cups have you had? One. You know what? Three. I'm getting better about my coffee shame. So... I unpacked your stuff. And I organized all your clothes. And all of your notebooks are on the table now, see? You are such a good writer. You read my stuff? Well, your notebooks were, like, right there - after I unzipped your bags. - Huh? So is that, like, songs or do you write poetry or... It's so beautiful. Hmm, thanks. I'm a singer. I write my own stuff. You know I sing, right? - No, I didn't know that, Jess. - Three, two, one. ♪ Un-break my heart ♪ Say you'll love me again Are we really doing this right now? - ♪ Un-cry these tears - Jess. - ♪ I cried so many ni... Oh. That's just a little snack. You'll get a full meal at church today. I'm on the praise team. I don't do church. - Sam. Emotional support blanket. I get it. Mom and Dad asked me to leave the room when Uncle Darius called about you moving here, so I left and listened from the hall. You've done some thangs, huh? Your testimony gonna be the GOAT, girl. - Wait, what are you doing? - I'm going back to sleep, Jess. - But it's Sunday. - And? This is Atlanta. Sunday means church. Well, God hasn't been taking my requests, so Sunday means nothing. He's God, not Santa Claus. Whatever. - We're going to church. - Who you think you talking to? - You. - Me? "No weapon formed against me shall prosper." - What weapon? - We are going to church. - Now. - I don't have church clothes. You can borrow some of mine. Here you go. Auntie Liz, no, no, no, no, no. Avocado toast is avocado and toast. No gravy. That just don't seem right. Let's go. We're late. You're not riding with us? Gonna take Sam the scenic route. Get her excited about living in the A. - Oh. Good morning, baby. Mm, morning. Your dad said you're not answering his calls. I have nothing to say to that man. Does it ever stop? LIZ and LARRY: No. Is that for me? Is there a concert? That's church. Okay. This is promising. Whoo! Where are you going? Oh, that's Champion Life. That's not our church. Girl, please.

Larry ain't letting you go to TY's house. And that's on God. Girl, I am grown. Ain't nobody gonna be telling me what to do, not even Uncle Larry. Hmm. I thought we were going to church. This is it. It used to be a warehouse for an old oil factory, - but it's our church now. - Hmm. Look at us, twinsies. Oh, let's just take this little thot knot out. Oh, okay. Body positivity. Love to see it. You belong here. So, this is our congregation. Kind of small but mighty, as you can tell. They look fun. Oh, yes. That's the Party-Pulpit. Ah. - At the club on Saturday, then turn up to church on Sunday to get right with the Lord. It smells like D'USSEÉ and Black Milds over there. Yeah. And who are they? Our pastor, PG, lets them skate here when we're not in service. And that's Jermaine. He's a fire starter. Oh, so he be getting turnt, huh? Yes, and also he sets things on fire and burns them down. That was until PG stopped him. Hey, PG. Hey. I am starting to feel the spirit. Hmm. And who's that? Oh, that's Aaron. He used to be a big, you know, marijuana cigarette dealer here in Atlanta. - Really? - Then he suddenly and mysteriously stopped and gave his life to the Lord. I'd leave that one alone. Melissa, the daughter of our big donor, swears he's her soulmate. I'm not one to gossip, but she only came to this church following him. I don't know what he put on her, but they call him Big Love in the streets. Big Love, huh? Mm-hmm. - Hmm. That's her. Hey, sis. God bless. Hey, everyone. This is my cousin-sister Sam. She's from L.A., staying with me now. Sam, this is Jackie and Jermaine. Hi, Sam. Nice to meet you. The twins are oddly close, - but they have a sixth sense. - Hmm. And that's KiKi. KiKi! My cousin-sister Sam. Okay, dang, Jess, calm down. Hey, Sam. - Hey, KiKi. - What's up, Sam? - Hmm. Welcome to our church. Welcome to Atlanta. - It's nice to meet you. I'm Melissa, captain of the praise team. - It's nice to meet you. So, uh, what's it like? Praise team? Come and find out. Maybe I will. Let's go. Nice to meet you, Sam. Have a seat. Have several. - Okay. - I know that b... Don't worry about her. Just come and sit down. Oh, I'm-a have a seat all right. - If you love the Lord, say amen. Amen. - Can we make a joyful noise in here, please? - Yes. Presence of the Lord is here today. Amen? - Amen. Yes. Amen. Amen. In a moment, we'll have a-a number from our praise team, but we're excited. Slap your neighbor and tell them you're excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. We are excited... - I'm excited. Okay. Oh. 'cause our praise team is going to be performing and competing at the national championships again this year. You guys must've thought I lost faith after what happened last year. Not gonna lie. I was shook. But we're going back. We have to. We can't let fear have the victory. Just no cussing or big ol' juicy metaphors, Aaron. Won't do it. And, Jess... just try to stay conscious. Thank you, Pastor. As team captain, I am excited to lead and confident that God is going to anoint my arrangements... Mm. And will bless us with victory. Mm-hmm.

Well, I wouldn't be so sure. You know, God works in some really shitty places. You know, his son was actually born in a barn. Yeah, that is pretty shitty. Them cows stank.

It really changed me, you know? Like, deep, deep inside. Oh, that's wonderful, Sam. I know. Jess, you didn't mention you had praise team practice tonight. I, uh...

Friends help friends. I don't have friends. We'll see. Sam, good job tonight. Are you okay? You seemed a little emotional singing out there. Me? Nah. I've rocked bigger rooms than that before. But praise songs hit people's heart a little different. You're the number one lady or something, right? Yeah, you could say that. - I'm the first lady. - Huh. Well, let me let you in on a little secret. I don't really have a relationship with God. I just know how to rhyme. Mm-hmm. Well, obviously, God has a relationship with you. - Mm-hmm. I don't think so. God used fish, donkeys, even hoes to get his word across. So don't think he won't use you, too. That's Bible. Let's go get 'em at locals. What's-what's going on?

Every time, worship slay. What's the promise? To not to have, you know... S-E-X. No sex? They say it's the vow of celibacy that gives them perfect pitch. Mm-mm. Jess! - Hi. - Hi. - Thank you.

What can I get you? - Uh, rum and Coke. - Can I just see your I.D.? Yeah. ♪ I'm caught up in this holy moment... ♪ Okay, Deborah Goldstein. Thanks. Oh. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. Are you kidding me with this weak-ass drink? Mm-mm. I need another shot. I'm sorry. I can't. ♪ Take me back to where we started ♪ ♪ I open up my heart Oh, great. ♪ To you ♪ Oh, I'm not here for blessing ♪ - ♪ Oh, no ♪ Jesus, you don't owe me anything ♪ ♪ And more than anything that you can do ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ I just want you ♪ I just want you ♪ I just want you. - Thank you, Rob. - You're welcome. So, what are you doing here? I could be asking you the same thing, first lady. Well, um, I'm grown. And this is my place. Yeah. Natalie, that's-that's me. What's your excuse? I didn't want to go home. The team is in their feelings because I switched up the music. So the new music was your idea? Mm-hmm. [sighs] Yeah. And I kind of stole it from somebody who was gonna help me get my music career going. He was there. And we lost anyways. No fun in sinning and not winning, huh? Mm. Who you telling? But you're a singer for real. Why aren't you running things every Sunday? Ooh, that, um, that used to be me. Yeah. Back in the day, it was all about me. What I could receive. The money, the fame, the attention, the men. That was before PG. - Okay. - Okay. But, you know, praise, it... it works different. And it hits people different. You were right. The other night when I sang at the arcade, you said I looked like I was scared. I felt like a fraud, you know? Singing about having faith and trusting God. When my mom died, I stopped talking to God. He wasn't listening, so I stopped. You know, God, he doesn't promise we'll get everything we want. Life is going to do life, hon. You'll have some wins and you'll have some losses. But God promises to always be there. - I am not so sure about that. - Yeah. You know what? That's okay. But guess what. Of all the lounges, you strolled into mine. Look, I get it. I do. Sometimes life can go so wrong that you have to really sit down and think, "What's good?" I mean, "What's really good?" - You know? - Yeah. But you got to count your blessings, okay? That's where it starts. And that's praise. - Thank you. - All right. I'm sorry. Me, too. - Love you. - Love you. - Oh. Hello. Oh, hi, PG. What? Yes. I'll be right there. Sam! Sam? TY? TY, if you could just let me in to explain. Go away. He don't want to talk to you. TY, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. You trusted me, and I blew it. Hang up on her, man. I'll try not to take too much of y'all time. Evidently, the Promise Ringtones' church will not allow Kelly to sing, and, uh, the rest of the Ringtones will not compete without her. Wait, what happened? There's a tape. Uh, apparently Kelly and one of the guys from church... Oh, tea! A sex tape? - KiKi. - You right, PG. I'm-a mind my own business, but I'm-a start tomorrow. Thank you. So, according to their church rules, Kelly is not allowed to perform with the team. That's not how we roll here, okay? That's their church rules. So, you have been invited to nationals. Sam. Did you get my message? Yeah. Uh... I'm sorry to hear about Kelly. She was really nice to us. So what do you think about competing? You guys still want me on the team? - Duh. -Of course. - Duh. Of course. - AARON [chuckles]: Yeah. I ever tell y'all how I became a pastor? - Mm-mm. - No. I stole the wrong car. - What? - Or the right one, depending on how you look at it. I stole a car that belonged to a pastor, and I got caught. In exchange for not pressing charges, he made me come to his service every Sunday for the next three months straight. - Oh, wow. - Mm-hmm. Now, that first Sunday was my first time at church ever. But I knew that my life was gonna change from that day on. You see, all of us, no matter what, we're gonna fail. We're gonna mess up. We're gonna make mistakes. All of that. So what? Get over it. Just keep going no matter what. Your story ain't over. All right. Y'all let me know what y'all want to do. It's on y'all. - Bye. - All right, Peeg. Okay, before you guys say anything, I would feel a lot better if I could just say a few things that I'm grateful for. - Go ahead. Oh, I got to hear this. So, in no particular order, as Usher would say... ♪ These are my confessions. First of all, I can't judge Kelly because the footage that is out there on me... whew! Damn. And I know God has covered a pregnancy stick or two, - because when I say... - Mm-hmm. Your girl has been reckless, she has been reckless. Come on, now. And that night that I blacked out off the D'USSEÉ and the car got me home... Jesus. To this day, I still don't know how. But now I know it was you, God. I know it. I feel it. I know it. Told you that D'USSEÉ do that. D'USSEÉ be testing our faith. Won't he do it? And do, and do. My mom had this wild faith in me. And in God, too. And I'm beginning to see how it all connects, how God loves us and how we love each other. And I didn't understand that until I came here and I met some really cool people. Aw. Who I know will always have my back. You know it. We got you. And I'll always have yours. I knew your testimony was gonna hit different. Whew. Okay. - Guys, if we're confessing... - All right. Um, [sighs] after, you know, I got all those IG followers after Sam sang at the Painted Duck... Mm-hmm. -...um, I may have gotten carried away and opened a OnlyFans. - OnlyFans? - That's how I got this watch. What's the at name on that? I-I want to see if it's... You telling the truth, see it's really you. I closed it down. Now, anybody else got something to confess? Y'all ain't gonna believe this, but, um... I never stopped selling weed. - We know. Everybody knows. - Okay. -Yeah, everybody knows. - Y'all knew? Okay. - I didn't know. Yeah, it's over now. You know, uh... Well, it is this one dude. I still got to serve him. But after that, I'm done. It's just on some street stuff with him. And I'm dating somebody from Champion Life. What? - -Traitor. Okay, okay. Now it makes sense why you friend-zoned me. And me. Jess, I... Come on. Now, that... Baby. Melissa finds out that your true boo is standing right beside her at Champion Life... ha! -Ooh. - Your tires gonna get slashed. So... what do we do about finals? ♪ We gon' be all right, we gon' be all right ♪ ♪ I'm living my best life, I'm living my best life... ♪ Girl. Did you hear about that Promise Ringtone? No. What? Sex tape. - What? - Mm-hmm. No. Now they won't let her compete. - What? Now, if they sat me down every time I did a sex... Oh, no. No, no. - Shh, shh. No. - I mean... - Okay, I'm just saying. Hey, PG. - What's up, man? Good luck, Pastor. - Thank you. Oh, look who showed up. The Chevron reverend himself. Hey, man. You know what's funny about God? You with the Oil Factory and y'all had just enough fuel to make it to finals. - God got a sense of humor. I tell you what. Funny. Hey, man. - Okay. - Bruh. I owe you something? What you talking about, brother? Like, I mean, Jesus paid the price. But you still acting like I owe you something. So what's up? Take your foot off the gas a little bit. We're just two brothers, you know. - Foot off the gas. - Right. Hey, and-and I know you a bishop, right? So you understand that the oil represents God's spirit. So being in the Oil Factory is good with me. You feel me? I feel... I-I-I-I knew that, so... I mean, everybody know that, right? That's in the New-New Testament. John, chapter... Yeah. Enjoy the show, everybody. Chile, I heard that clap back all the way over here. - Hey, I'll be right back. - Oh, it's about to start.
