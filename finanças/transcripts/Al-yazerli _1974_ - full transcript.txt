Let the children work! Nobody listened to me. It's shameful that men should hide like rats! You made a deal with those scoundrels... ...and you want to hire them so your boss can save money! Are you accusing me, you mongrel! Yes, I made a deal with them... ...and I take them on even if you don't agree. Your father will come home, even if it's late. During summer... ...he goes to villages that are very far away. and he waits until it gets cold. Why villages so far away? Isn't he scared? To sell his wares, my daughter. There aren't any good markets in the villages around here... ...and the peasants are poor like us. Other sellers don't go to the mountains. Only your father goes to the mountains. The people there know him well. They buy a lot of things from him. He comes home alone at night? And how he can he find his way in the dark? Does he know the way well? And in the stories you tell, you say... “The mountains are full of evil spirits, monsters and thieves." The mountains are full of evil spirits, monsters and thieves. The mountains are full of evil spirits, monsters and thieves. May God keep our father safe and sound. May God protect him from the wicked... ..and from every flying and crawling creature... ...that threatens people. And ward off evil. May God make his way easier so that he can sell his goods. And ward off evil. May God make his way easier... ...so that he can sell his wares. May God the merciful... ...not allow this child to become an orphan. The light is off... ...and the enemy is gone. Mum...! Where's my sister? She's gone to heaven, my darling. Honey... Honey... Who gave you this money? The woman who was in the cab. You didn't have to take it. It's charity. I don't want you to accept charity. In your life, never accept charity again. I did not ask for alms. She put the money in my pocket. What did she tell you? She didn't say anything. Well yes... She said "honey". She was crying. I swear to you Mum, she was crying. She's your sister. Don't tell your father. And the money? Go buy candles and incense. Are you crying, Mum? I wanted to see her and talk to her after all these years. Why doesn't she think to visit you more often? Why did she come through here and go off so quickly? She was afraid. She was afraid your father would see her. But Dad is never home during the day. Doesn't she know that? She knows. But she can't. She's afraid of causing a scene... ...if your father ever finds out. The night she ran away from home was a terrible night. What can I say? It was a difficult time... ...and she was destitute and ignorant. She didn't realise... ...that hunger can lead to doing bad things. God forgive us! We didn't know how to forgive her nor how to help her. Poverty... Poverty, my son... ...is the origin of evil and the scourge of society. Go to bed... ...and leave that matter to God. I'm waiting for Dad. You can wait for him in your bed. Maybe he'll be very late. I won't sleep till he's here. Tomorrow, I'll go down to the port, and work with the gang. I'll take you to see the fantastic plane... ...and we'll take pictures to make that bastard Al-Yazerli jealous. Don't you have any work today? I'll take pictures with my friends and then go to work. Can we meet at noon? Yes, at lunch break. OK. Why are you late, you sons of dogs? This time I'll have to fire you... ...and throw that hooligan into the sea. Do what you want. - Shut up! - And if I don't? What if I don't shut up? I'll show you the photo of us with the plane. The plane? Inside the plane? That's right, look! My god, that's right, they're sitting inside the plane. It's just a wooden plane and it's on the ground. At least it's a plane, not like your junk. I'll break your neck, you son of a bitch! If I let the kids work at your place, I'd be the son of a whore like your mother. What are you waiting for? Back to work, now! Come over to the depot so that we can agree. And everyone goes back to their work. Otherwise, I'll forbid you from entering this place. You're just insulting us and we bring you labour every day. We make him skip school to come and work for you. You? Come here. All that was missing was this child. O God, why have you abandoned us? Why are you punishing us poor fishermen? I don't work if he doesn't work. I told you, come and let us agree. I'll only come if you keep your word. Remember, you just promised, while holding your moustache. Everyone get to work! Everyone get to work! He's fine. He's going to work. Why don't you come back, Dad? The wolves ate me. But we're waiting for you. You are going to be the head of the family. Don't cry my son. Life is hard. Think about your family. And beware of hungry wolves. Did you see Sabiha today when she was talking to me? She's beautiful, isn't she? I know her well from the neighborhood. You know her? Have you ever seen that crazy guy look at her beautiful breasts? Have YOU seen her breasts? And how! The madman gave her his whole bagful and left. And do you like them? A bit. Women...! God damn you! You're a hopeless bunch! I'll cut your pay if there's no marking. What can we do? The ship won't accept the goods without the marking. I can write these letters. You? Can you read and write? Yes. Do you read and write in foreign-language, kid? In Arabic and foreign. Look at the kid, look! He's writing in foreign-language. He writes, he really writes! The ship's calling for the goods. What, can't you hear? Don't push it Yazerli... ...your men work harder than they should need to. My men? The men work hard in the other depots. You are old and you're no better than women. If you don't like us, you can fire us. There are thousands of jobs down there. Yes, of course there's lots, because it's summer. But in winter it'll be different, and you'll be begging me. We'll never beg you. You know your men well. Without them you'll be a beggar. Shut up! Or I'll rip your eye out of its socket, you con! You're too much of a woman to do that! Too much of a woman, am I?! That's enough, enough! Get back to work. We'll fix that tonight. I don't work if you don't pay me in advance. I'll be your guest at the bar, in advance. I accept the proposal... But it depends on your work. Out of the way! Why are you laughing? He had a piss. Why are you bugging me? I piss like everyone else. You pissed like everyone else? Where did you hide the wheat? Wheat? Have you seen Sabiha today? Have you seen her breasts? Sabiha! She showed you her breasts? Tell me, I'll give you another pack of cigarettes. Have you seen Sabiha's breasts? Tell me! Tell me! Take the notebook and write. Delivered to Jawad on this date... Five kilos of wheat. Change the date. Ten kilos of lentils. God damn you! It's so hot and you're wearing jackets. Come closer. The weight goes down and it's me who gets into trouble. Put everything out. You're getting hard again. All I got is a handful of wheat... ...that I'd picked up while sweeping, to make a soup for the children. It's a handful of wheat... ..which will neither enrich me nor impoverish you. You know very well that 1, 2 or 3 handfuls, I let pass. Otherwise, it all must be put back. Understood? O my balls! I'll go with him to the bar. He won’t get out of getting drunk tonight. Well done, you're a good lad. Take that as a bonus. Don't tell anyone. Tomorrow, bring a jacket, like everyone else. Tell your mum to make big pockets for you. Winter days are coming... ...and a little soup won't hurt the family. His father's going to be real happy when he comes back... ...and sees that his son is a writer. Tonight my father is coming home... ...and tomorrow morning... ...we go down to work together. I think about her all week... ...and the weekend. I try to see her or hear from her. She is a sweet woman, like a ripe fig. She is too nice to all and sundry. I want to take her in my arms and hug her against my ribs. Her days are numbered. Her parents are trying to marry her off to a teacher. A teacher! They say he's a teacher. I should have been a teacher to be able to be with her. But... ...can the teacher hoist a sack that weighs over 100 kilos? He'd damage his back. The teacher has no strength. He only has a damn piece of white chalk. Forget teachers and sacks... ...and tell me what it's like to sleep with women. Sleeping with women is delicious. Very good. There's nothing in the world like this pleasure. It's beyond compare. As for me, right now... ...I want nothing but Sabiha. Nothing keeps me going, except Sabiha. Hearing about Sabiha. Sabiha! Sabiha! Can't get enough of talking about Sabiha? And do you ever get enough of talking about women? Women are like mosquitoes... When they're hungry, they bite you and they suck your blood. But these bites are delicious. Sweet and delicious. And when you get used to it, you can't live without it. Okay, so tell me about Sabiha. It remains a secret between us, I dream of Sabiha injecting me. Do you understand? Are you marrying him? My parents want me to get married. Women should marry early. If you marry him, I won't be able to talk to you anymore, Or walk with you. Don't worry. If I get married... it's better. Don't understand? Of course, I understood. Today, you can come with me. Come in... There's no one here. Come in! Okay, I'm going. Be a man and don't say anything. So she agreed to marry the teacher. So what are you going to do? If I was able to change my age, I'd run away with her. Do you love him that much? I can't forget her kisses. Every night I dream of her kisses. I even kissed her without fear. Then suddenly Al Yazerli was put in jail. I was very sad for him. I didn't understand what had happened, until a friend of mine told me: Al Yazerli attacked his neighbour, who was as naked as the day she was born. Without any clothes? I told you naked, like the day her mother gave birth to her. And how did he see her naked? She was washing herself... She was sitting in a big bath, and her chest... and her breasts... and her white back... Have you ever seen a naked woman? That night, I dreamed of the naked woman, and I forgave Al Yazerli who saw her... And I was shocked at his courage to break into her house, and I wondered: What will he do when he gets home? The workers left the prison without having had a talk with him. His love for Sabiha drove him crazy. He hasn't spoken with anyone... ...since he attacked her while she was naked.
