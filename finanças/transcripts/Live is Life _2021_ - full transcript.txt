[school bell ringing] [upbeat music playing] [boy 1] Last day of school. In 1985, for any 15-year-old kid, it was the best. [indistinct chatter] But my life wasn't that easy. The worst part isn't being chased by the toughest guys in class every day. The worst is when they catch you. [boy 2] Hey, asshole! Come here! [dramatic music playing] Stop running! We're gonna catch you, you losers! Come back, you shitheads! Cowards! Fucking stop running! You know we'll get you. Get those little cowards! - [people chattering] - [dog barking] [both panting] [boy 2] Chickenshits! Where are you? [boy 3] Unbelievable. Those handball team bastards can't spare us on the last day of school. I know. Those big jerks will take my Nikes. What's gonna happen to your grades? Will you pass? Your parents are gonna freak out. We'll figure it out, Noguera. But I have to get going now. My father goes mental when we're in traffic. You'll take the catch-up exams. So tell your folks. I'll be alone next year if you don't pass. Fine. I'll find a way. But I'll handle it after Midsummer's Eve. That's for sure. - [car screeching] - They're coming. - You go left, I'll go right. - [all clamoring] [boy 1] Run! [boy 2] There they are. - Hey! You can't get away! - [boy 4] You lowlifes! [boy 2] Cowards! Come here. - [boy 4] Chickenshits! - [brakes squealing] [boy 2] We're gonna get you! You can't outrun us! - Hey! - [boy 3] Hey! [boy 4] Out of the way. Move! - [indistinct shouting] - Come back, you jerks! [mom] There you are, finally. [dad] Do I have permission to start driving, sir? [boy 1] Yeah, yeah. Yes. [dad] Thank you. Half the school already came out, David. - Yeah. - Better run, next time I pick you up. - But I ran, Dad. - Always a "but" with you. [mom] Oh, cut it out, please. [dad] Every minute delayed means an extra 30 in traffic. - Yeah, you told me. I know. Sorry. - Say bye to your friends. Show some respect, even if it's just for them. - Yeah, yeah. - [dad] Gonna be late because of him again. [mom] All right, enough. Go. [dad] All right, I'm pulling out. Again with that doll, son? - Yeah. - Don't understand this kid. - Gonna be a long trip. - Headphones, music, shutting us out. - [mom] Let him be. Let's go. - Tuna again, Mom? - It stinks. - What do you mean? - [dad] Says it stinks. - [mom] This kid is such a disgrace. If it's tuna or ham, he complains. Who do you think you are? [dad] Eat and shut up.

Don't slam the doors. - [woman] Hi. - [Lúa] Hi. - [Rodri] How are you, Grandpa? - Seen the time? - Get here. I want a nice hug, handsome. - [Rodri] Hi, Grandma. - Sweetheart. - How are you? - [dad] Good to see you. [grunts] - Good to see you, son. I'm sure you're tired. - [Lúa] A little. - Good to see you. Oh, my darling son. - Ah! - [dad grunts] - Now you're gonna break me. - [dad chuckles] What's up? Been eating? - [grandma] Of course. - [Lúa] Thanks. - [grandma] You're thin. - [dad] No. [grandma] Oh, sweetie. - [grandpa] This is heavy. - [Rodri] See you, Mom. What? You're leaving? [Rodri] I'm going to see my friends for a while. - Haven't seen them so long. - We just got here. - They're so happy to see you. - You mind? - Let the boy have fun. - Of course not. - Have fun. - Hey, curfew's at 9:00, okay? - Not a second later. - Listen. Don't get all dirty. I don't want to spend my vacation doing your laundry, okay? - I know him. - Have fun. - Bye. - [both chuckle] - [dad] Nine o'clock sharp. - Yeah, yeah. [insects trilling] [chuckling] What? No, no, no! - [boy 1] Yes! It worked. Gotcha! - [Rodri] No, wait. No. No, no. - [boy 1] Wait just a little longer. - [Rodri chuckling] Stop it. No, no! Hey. Get me out of here, please. No, no, please! [Rodri] I knew something was up. I was like, - "Hey, where are they?" - [boy 2] Yeah, right. - [Rodri] I saw you behind the tree. - [boy 1] Bullshit. - [boy 1] You saw us? - [Rodri] I did. - You always fall for it. - [boy 2] Yeah. - What've you been up to? - Just trading cards. But this bastard has Lobo Carrasco and doesn't wanna trade it. It's the last one I need. Give me Butragueño and I'll give you Carrasco. If I give you Buitre, my deck will suck. My idea was to give you a card you don't have that I have twice? Fine. Let me see. Have it. Have it. Have it. Have it. Have it. Have it. - You don't have this. How about we trade... - Yeah, no. I'd rather not. - [boy 1] I'll trade it for this one. - No. You're still trading cards? That's for babies. We're too old for this. - No, we're collectors, okay? - All right. Listen to me. These two plus one… No. Make it two steel marbles. - [Rodri] Marbles are for kids. - [boy 1] You are a kid. Hey, what is this? Some firecrackers and stuff? - Maza, you see? - Don't touch that. Come on. - It isn't yours. - They're so loud. - No, man. No. - Come on. One for each of us. - [Rodri] Why not share? - I bought them. I'll blow 'em up. - Don't be an ass, Garri. - [Rodri] You get an allowance. I don't. - [Garriga] Not my problem. - Where's your brother? How is he? Okay. Left the hospital. He's at home now. He was so sick of being stuck in there. He gonna go with us? Not sure. Depends on how he's feeling and I guess what we'll be doing, you know? Fine. Here, take one. [Maza chuckling] - [scoffs] For real, Garri? - Always so generous. Right, Garriga? - So generous. - You're something else. - He rocks. - Stop. [chuckling] Check it out, Maza. [Maza] You're so stingy, man. Where's Suso? Shouldn't he be here with us? He's got a job at the Casebios'. A pool-boy gig. - [Garriga] He's really busy. - We should pay him a visit as a surprise. - Startle him like we always do. - Let's do it. [lighthearted music playing] [Suso exclaiming] - No, guys. Come on! - You're going down. [chuckles] [Suso grunts] [Maza] It's what you deserve. [Garriga] Oh, no! [Rodri laughing] [Garriga grunts] [all chuckling] [Rodri] Yeah, that's it! [boys laughing] - [Suso] You guys are ridiculous. - [Garriga] Working tomorrow? No. The job finishes today, so I promised I'd visit my dad at the hospital. - How is your father? - Well, they say he's a bit better. Still in a coma, though. - So what are we doing tomorrow? - [Garriga] I've got an idea. - Yeah? - A girl I know is throwing a party. - Party? Come on. - Yeah. Live music and stuff. - You were formally invited? - Pretty much. Wait. So you were invited for real? - Want us to crash? - [Garriga] Ask her to join our crew. - Are you serious? - Come on. [Garriga] We're the only losers who don't have a girl in their crew. - So what? - Seriously, this is stupid. Thinking about going to a party you were never invited to, to tell a girl, "Wanna join our crew?" You fall on your head? It's not like we're strangers. We're in class together. - We got to take risks. - Yeah, risk-taker. [chuckles] No, I have a better plan. - What? - Spend the night away from home. - So we can go to that party. - No. Give it up. No way. - What were you thinking? - The top of the mountain. We'd have to get up early. Mm, at 6:00 in the morning. - We'll be there just a night. - Sounds like fun. - But I doubt my parents will say yes. - Whatever. - Tell them we're all going. - No. Won't make a difference. Why not? They'll ask if we all jump off a cliff, that mean you'll do it? Full of shit. - You're the one who said they'd forbid it. - Moron. So, uh, what do you want to do up there? Camp there. We'd make a fire, watch the fireworks and bonfires. - The view is unbelievable. - [Maza] That's it? That's the plan? - Nothing more? - Mm, yeah. Wanna climb a mountain that's super far away to check the view? It's really far on foot. We can't bike all the way. Besides, you don't know mountains. You live in a townhouse in Alcorcón. - [boys laughing] - You're a clown. So how will we get there? - [Suso] Through the dodgy area. - What? No. I don't want to. No way. No. It's not happening. - It's way too dangerous. - We've never even gone there, though. - How would we know it's dodgy? - That's true. That's what I heard. Spill it. You wanna go pick some plants, right? - What plants? - No, Maza, it's to do something new. I live here year round. I'm tired of doing the same thing. Why would we pick plants? It's 'cause they say that if you get a certain plant on Midsummer's Eve and drink a potion made with the plant before sunrise, it'll cure you if you're sick. Don't know what it cures, but my dad says it's been named The Breath of the Earth. Breath of the Earth? No truth to it. It's just village-folk gibberish. You don't know what you're saying. The moment's magical. Only happens once a year. We don't have to go if you don't want to. - We'll simply do the same shit. - I'm tired of always doing the same shit. Let's find out the truth. I've got a job to finish. Bright and early tomorrow. - Six o'clock at Maza's. - Fine. Yeah. Sounds good. Oh, shit! I got to go, guys. You don't need those firecrackers. - You're a rocket, Rodri. Let's go! - Be here by 6:00. And your brother. He in? No idea. He left the hospital yesterday, and he's back in ten days. He should come. We really miss him. - It would be great. - I know. Out of there, Garriga. I have work to finish. Garriga! Hey, don't get me wet. I'm all dry already. [motorcycle engines revving] [dramatic music playing] - How's it going, kid? You didn't say hi. - Leave me alone. [biker 1] He wants us to leave him alone. How about that? [laughs] What's up, cutie? You didn't warn us you were coming through here. - Leave me alone, please. - Watch it, boy. [biker 1 whooping] [biker 1 exclaiming] You don't want to hang out with lots of losers. [biker 1 whooping] You better pedal fast. - Stop it, guys. - [biker 1] Pedal! [Rodri] Leave me alone. Oh. Come on, little boy. Come on, pedal faster. - [laughs] We're gonna get you. - [Rodri] Go away! [biker 1] Let's go! Let's go! Come on. Try to beat our motorcycles. Go, go, go, go, go! - Yeah, that's it! - Coward! [biker 1] Come on, kid. Whoo! Faster! Let's go! Look at me, kiddo. You can't escape me. That's right. Go, go, go, go! - [biker 1] Whoo! Whoo-hoo! - [Rodri] Aah! [biker 1 laughs] [gasps] [panting] Some punks trapped me, and I fell off my bike into the water. I tried to get away, but there were so many of them. It was awful. That's what happened. [cuckoo clock chiming] - [all laughing] - What's so funny? What, Dad? Punks. Please, quit inventing stories. It's ridiculous. You fell in on your own. - Did not. - I told you not to get dirty. Get changed. This is embarrassing. You heard your mother. Tonight you'll eat in the kitchen. - And no TV. I've had it with you. - What? - But why? - Punks. You're the punk. - It wasn't his fault. Don't punish him. - You're too kind. - Grandma's right. - [mom] No. It's unfair and wrong. I keep getting bullied. Yesterday the handball guys, today the punks. How can you blame me for this? It's not my fault. Sioux did it. - [laughs] - They're worse than the plague. - Sioux. Now it's Sioux. - What are you trying to say? - You said they were punks. - Yeah, punks. Sioux. - [dad] Why are you making stories? - Nothing's made up. We're not idiots. You need to learn. No dessert for you. Why do that to me? Keep on talking, you'll go straight to bed without dinner. - Go on. Get outta here. - Let's go. Change your clothes. - He's filthy. - So unfair. I can't believe it. He's a complete mess. - [ululates mockingly] - What an imagination. Come on. I had no idea there were Sioux in your town, Mom. - [grandma] You were worse than he is. - [mom] Like father, like son. [family continues indistinctly] [indistinct chatter continues] - Hey. - We had a beautiful time. Right, Manuel? - You know very well times have changed. - I'm going to sleep now. - Fine by me. - You're tired, sweetheart? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [grandma] It's normal. Uh, tomorrow I'm going to Suso's for Midsummer's Eve. - We'll all have a party and a sleepover. - How fun. So, uh, who else is gonna be there? The usual crew. Yeah. I'd really like to go with the guys because Suso's been so sad about his father. - Oh, yes. Poor dear. - Yes. The poor boy. It's tragic. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Really painful for him. - Yes. - All right. I'll, uh, allow it. - Good night, Grandpa. But call us tomorrow at supper, hmm? - Yeah. Not a problem. - [dad] Make sure you're okay. So, see you tomorrow. - Good night, Grandpa, Grandma. - Sweet dreams. - See you. - See ya. This show is so hilarious, don't you think? [mom] I've never seen it. [man on TV] Who said I wasn't paying attention? The nerve. [canned laughter on TV] [TV audience applauds] - [ticking] - [rooster crowing] [alarm ringing] [alarm stops] [grunts softly] [pleasant music playing] [sighs] [hens clucking] - What happened here? - Shh. The Sioux, they attacked me. Really? What do you mean? What'd they do? Punks nearly killed me. Made me fall off my bike into the water. [cow mooing] - [Rodri] The twins. - What's up? - [Rodri] Álvaro! - Hey. How you doing? Hey. - What's going on? - What's up? - Hey, Rodri. - [Rodri chuckles] - Everything all right? - Yeah. How are ya? - I'm doing great. - Been so long. - Hey, Garri. You okay? - [Rodri chuckles] - Yeah. And you? - What's going on? - Little Suso. - [Suso] How are you? - [Álvaro] How you been? Things good? - [Suso] Been all right. - How are you? - I'm fine. I'm always fine. So, where to? Hey, where are we going? - To the Templars, as usual. - [Álvaro] All right. - Let's go. - All right. [captivating music playing] [Suso] Rodri, how'd you convince your folks? - [Rodri] I said we'd be at your place. - [Suso] No way. - [Garriga] Said I was going to your house. - [Rodri] Garri, why are you laughing? - [Garriga chuckles] - [Rodri] What if they call? No one will answer. My dad wouldn't use the phone if our house was on fire. We're covered. - What'd you tell your parents? - Nothing much. We're going to Garri's. If we said we were going to your place, they'd have said no to Álvaro. [Rodri] It's tricky getting away with this. If one of our parents calls to check in, we're dead meat. [Maza] Guess so. [Suso] I'm glad they let you come. You're still in treatment? Yeah, it never ends. Same shit as always, bro. It's supposed to cure cancer, but in the end, it fucking kills you too, 'cause it kills everything good and bad. They give you two fucking weeks between rounds then start over. And your father, how is he? Is he on the mend? No change. Ever since he fell off Buján's roof, he's been unconscious. He's gonna wake up. I know it. - Hope so, Álvaro. He's a strong guy. - No doubt. I'm sure touching your bald head brings good luck. [both chuckle] - I don't know. - Know what I remembered now? - No, what? - That time I got the measles. All these chickenshits wouldn't come to see me. But you came to keep me company and caught it too, right? - We were together for a month. - You think I'd forget? - You should ask my parents if I remember. - [chuckles] They were so pissed off. That month was one of the best ever. Yeah, it was great. [birds cawing] [water dripping] - [Suso] Watch your head. - [Maza] That's it. There. [creaking] - [Suso] Go, Garriga. - [Garriga] Shut up, Suso. [Rodri] God, it's so dusty. [Suso] Slide it from the bottom. - Hang on. I'll help. - [Suso] Three, two, one. [all grunting] [stone grinding] - [Rodri] Whoa! - [Garriga] It looks bad. It's fine. Take it and let's go to the quarry. No, not the quarry. That's where those punks hang out. We need to avoid them. Go around. You're right. I don't wanna get robbed or beaten up to a pulp. - Why'd they beat you up? - Chill out, Garri. - No reason to be afraid of them. - No, they're really bad. Punks near my house mugged me, like, ten times. Every time, those fuckers took all my stuff, except for this cheap watch. Watch your mouth, man. We're in a sacred place. [Garriga] Sorry. - I think they know what my father said. - What? My father said, if my watch got stolen, he'd buy me a new one with a calculator. But it hasn't happened yet. I said they could take it, but they didn't want it. Serious? You think the punks know what your dad promised? - So your dad's a punk then if that's true. - [all laughing] In your fancy neck of the woods, even the punks are picky. - Yeah. - Right. Once they tried to get me. I know karate, so I kicked 'em in the balls. - They don't mess with me anymore. I swear. - Really? Kicked 'em? Again with the karate. Yeah. So what? This year, I'll get my brown belt. - I'll be a fucking black belt. - [Maza] Problem? I told you not to swear. Sorry, but I don't believe you at all. I've never seen you do karate. - No? - [Garriga] All right. Punch me. - You sure? - Yeah. Show us a kata. - Really sure? It's on. - He wants you to beat him up. - Get up then. - I'm not getting up, Maza. You get up. I've told you before, the sensei does not want us to show off our skills in public. It's an art, not a show. I don't care what you think. I won't show you. He's telling the truth. - You're full of it. - You should listen to Álvaro. [Suso] All right. - [Álvaro] Let's go. - [Rodri] Forget about it. [Suso] Bring it in. Three, two, one… [all] All together always! - Shh. - [all chuckling] Wait, how'd you… [shushes] Hey, don't push me. - Come on. - Let's go. - [Suso] What should we buy in Gorriona? - [Rodri] Creamy buns? - [Maza] No, jam buns. - [Rodri] Yeah, good call. And the white chocolate ones. They're the best. - [Maza] White chocolate sucks. - [Garriga] I like it. [Álvaro] Get everything you want, guys. This weekend's on me. [Rodri] Okay. - [man] It's good to see you. - [woman] It's been so long, right? [indistinct chatter] - [Garriga] Yes! - [Maza] Those ones. [Rodri] Nice! They have chocolate. Cheese puffs. Let's get those. - [Suso] Cheese puffs? - [Maza guffaws] - Let's get the others. - [Rodri sighs] - [cane taping] - [woman] Hey. Don't put anything that isn't yours in your pockets. - I know you, Garriga. - I only took a bag of cheese puffs once. - I know it was wrong. Happened once. - [chuckles] Yes, yes, just once. Are you gonna play foosball? We can't. We're busy. We have Midsummer's Eve plans. We're going camping on the mountain. Suso, we can't tell people what we're doing. - Please don't tell on us, Mrs. María. - María won't say a thing. Right? In life, there are many times that you see and hear things and stay quiet. Other times, you have to speak up. - Usually best to neither see nor hear. - [Garriga] Mrs. María? - And to shut up. - [chuckles] Yeah, but do you have those great ice cream cones and popsicles? Look at the poster. I only have what's not crossed out. Sorry to break it to you, but everything's crossed out. [chuckling] Only sliced ice cream. We have thin slices or thick slices. Thick ones. - We're in the mood to splurge. - [Garriga] Yeah! -Looks like someone's rich, -Not really. [María chuckles] All right. - Don't worry. We'll help. - Here you are. - You okay? - Let's open the freezer. [María] Glad you're going to the mountains. The view is lovely. But the climb up there is really steep. It's gonna be a challenge. You going to get the flower? They say the flower can cure anything, so, yeah. Ah, the flower is difficult to find, though. And it's not effective for long, so you have to use it fast. You know, I took it when I was little. - And look at me, strong as a bull. - [all chuckling] But don't go through the abandoned area. Avoid it. - It's just two hours more. - That's what I told Suso. He's stubborn and wants to pass through the slum. It's not that bad, María. No, it is bad, Suso. You're too young to be seeing that. [Garriga] She knows. We should listen to her. That's quite a slice, Mrs. María. This is bigger than a thick slice. No, dear. [chuckles] You weren't born when I started serving ice cream slices. I know what I'm doing. Super. - [María] Have fun. - Thank you. - [Suso] Thanks, María. - Use your common sense and have fun. Intuition. Follow it. - [Garriga] We will. - [Álvaro] Don't worry. [Rodri] I've never seen Mrs. María cut such a big slice of ice cream. She's probably never seen a dying boy before, so… - [Suso] How long were you there? - In the hospital? [Suso] Mm. Three months in a row. And going in and out of there around a year and a half. You're in good spirits despite that. It's amazing. My dad's been in a coma a month. One month. We're starting to lose hope. At first we were staying positive 'cause the doctors were saying that he'd beat it, he'd… he'd wake up, but days and weeks go by and… nothing seems to change. [sighs] When we found out I had cancer, they told my parents I only had a 5% possibility of surviving. Everyone lied to me and acted like everything was gonna be all right. But, uh… But I knew the truth that something was really wrong and that things wouldn't be as simple as they said. [chuckles softly] Then I met Albert. We got to know each other in the hospital. A ten-year-old kid. He taught me important lessons on the great art of letting go. That happiness doesn't exist. You need to find joy in each day. And that living only teaches you how to let go of what you have. Everything you've earned. It's why you really have to live life to the fullest. It's the only reason to live. You have to spend every second as if it were the last. You have to do it for your family, of course. You gotta stay strong for them. Right? But you have to do it for yourself especially. You got to live life for yourself, Suso. All right? [machine drilling] [suspenseful music playing] [indistinct chatter] We're in punk land right now. Quarry isn't theirs, but they won't let us pass. You, Karate Kid, can you take 'em on? I told you, Suso, I'm not fighting. Sorry, dude. But I told you many times, I won't fight without a reason. Fine. All right, guys, listen to me. We take a detour, go past the reservoir and the village... - Take a month to get there. Not an option. - No, they messed me up yesterday. - I'm not okay with that. - [Suso] I've got a great idea. Without motorcycles, Sioux are nothing. We just have to cut the gas lines and remove the spark plugs. - We'll bike past them, and that's it. - [Garriga] No. Rodri's right. We should go the other way. Quit being such a pain. If we chicken out already, we should just go back now. You're right. I'll do it. I'm the quickest. I'll handle the motorcycles. I'll cut the cables. Those punks need to be taught a lesson. [Maza] All right. But if you go, I'm going with you. You can't go on your own. [Álvaro] But I said I'd handle it. [Maza] You said you'd do it, but I'm not letting you go on your own. But can't you see me? I'm in great shape. - I have two arms. - You are not going. - Get your hands off of me. - Are you stupid? - You'd get dizzy. - [Álvaro] Whatever. If you're doing this, I'm going with you. - I'm way quicker than you. - You need to listen. - Do it with me. - [Rodri shushing] You'll go together, and that's it. You twins are a pain in the ass. - He has to go with me. - Give me all the firecrackers. Why? Why would you need all of them now? - Give 'em all to me. - Do it, Garriga. - Dick. - We'll use them as a distraction. After setting them off, we'll charge through on our bikes. - All right. - [Álvaro] Come on, let's go. - [Maza] Let's go, guys. - [Rodri] Bring the bag. - [Rodri] Stop. - [Garriga] Open it. Wait. - All right. - Hold out your shirt. Grab the ones at the bottom, Garriga. [suspenseful music playing] We wanna distract the guys, not murder them. [Suso] Just a few more. He is the biggest show-off. He's full of it. The place where we get hammered is close to his job… [Sioux clamoring] [Sioux 1] Get over here. Let's go. [Sioux boss] See anyone here? Something just exploded there. [Álvaro] Quick. [biker 1] See anything? Something fucking exploded. What the hell? [thrilling music playing] - [Sioux 1] Get on your bikes! - You're dead meat! - [all clamoring] - [Sioux 2] Get 'em! [Sioux 3] Go, go, go! [bikes sputtering] Something's off! - [boss] Not working. - [Sioux 4] This one, either. [Rodri] What about the twins? - [man 5] Let's go! - No! - Is it starting? Did you start it? - Won't start! Come on! [Sioux 4] Go get 'em! We'll get you both! Carrot Head. Here, take this one - They're not getting away. - Go! Go! What took you so long? - [Álvaro] Did you use dynamite? - That was my allowance in firecrackers. What the fuck? It won't start. - [engine revs] - Not firing. Don't know what's going on. - Let's go. - I'm trying. Cut all the cables? Didn't have time, and one was too hard. - How can we get away now? - [Álvaro] We have to trust Rodri. - No one can throw a boomerang like you. - What? No, no, no. Not true. I practice on Coca-Cola bottles. So what? Practice on those guys now. - I could kill someone with that. - Shut up. - Why? I'm outta here. - You're full of shit. Where you going? [engine revving] Hey, you bastards, watch out! I'll get you! Remember what he did to you? We need to give those punks a lesson they won't forget. You gotta do it. We'll distract him for ya. - [Sioux boss] Come and get it! - [Rodri] Go. Get over here if you have balls! [Garriga] Faster! Faster! [boss] Come here! - We can do this. - We can do what? We can do this. - He's catching up to us, Suso. - We can do this. Yeah, here! [Álvaro] Quick. Let's go. Suso. [Garriga] Quick! [biker grunts] - [grunting] - [Garriga] Let's go! [boys clamoring] [Álvaro] Let's go! [all shouting indistinctly] [Rodri] See how I got him? [chuckles] - [Maza] Behind you! - [Suso] Gotta go or they'll get us. [all shouting indistinctly] - [Álvaro] Come on, we gotta go! - [Sioux yelling] [Garriga] Gotta go right now! - [Suso] Let's go. Quick! - You're dead, man! I'll get you, and you'll pay for this, shithead! [Suso] Come here, Rodri! I'm gonna murder ya! [gasping] [groans] When I find you, you're dead! [mellow music playing] [Suso] Rodri! You did it, man. [both chuckling] [Rodri] Let's go down there. Come on. - [Álvaro] You got him good. - Our hero. - [Garriga] Unbelievable! Amazing! - [Álvaro] Legend. - Bring it here. That was great. - [Garriga] We'd be dead without you. - [Rodri] We did it. - [Maza] What? Outsmarted those idiots. I just threw the boomerang, and I don't know. Fuck. - How'd you learn to use it? - I was trying to hit the wheel. - You hit him, though. - Who cares anyway? You know what I think? That guy got what he deserved. - [Maza] Got the guy. All that matters. - If he finds us, he'll kill us. - Relax. - After that boomerang stunt, we're fine. - The firecrackers. What about them? - What? They made it all work. Yeah, of course. But why make such a big deal about it? I don't need to be the hero, but I had a lot to do with it. - My bike was brand new. - [thunder rumbling] We should get it fixed in the next town. Yeah, uh, no. We have a plan to stick to. - Your father will get you a new one. - I like the one I have. If we go through the next town, we'll go towards the river and avoid the sketchy part. Again? Hell, no. We're not avoiding the sketchy part. - We'll never get there in time. - [Garriga] In time for what? That magic plant thing? What do you need a shitty potion for? - What's it to you? Back off, Garriga. - What's it to me? I'm sick of you guys bossing me around. They almost murdered us, I'm out of firecrackers, and look at my bike. Like you don't have more firecrackers at your house. Always have double. At least I bring stuff. You never share, lowlife. - What did you say? - Hey! Calm down, Suso. - What did you fucking say to me? - [Maza] Suso! [Suso] The fuck did you say? The plant's for my father 'cause he's in a coma. If you don't get that, I don't care. Y'all can go do whatever you want. How'd you not get that we're doing this for his father? - I didn't pick up on it. - You're a piece of work. It's so obvious. We're doing this for his father. You really fucked up. I didn't know, so stop it. His father wasn't at all nice with him. - He's better off without him. - [Maza] Shut up. It was so obvious. - [Garriga] Álvaro! - Guys, help! Hey! Go get the water! Get it now! He needs water now! [Garriga] Come on. - [Rodri] Hey, Maza. - [Garriga] Álvaro. [Rodri] Maza, here, give him water. [Maza] Here, Álvaro, drink a little. [Maza] Álvaro, you okay? [Suso] Let him drink. We'll help him up. [Maza] Yeah, he needs to rest. - Need to find a place for him to rest. - One sip at a time. [Garriga] Let's go. [boys grunting] [Maza] All right. Go, go, go. [Garriga] Let's go, Álvaro. [thunder rumbling] Sorry, moron. Don't mention it, dummy. 'Kay, thanks, birdbrain. All right, you buttmunch. And so we're clear, I'm not a lowlife. Yeah, I know. And I'm not spoiled. - I wish I were, but I'm not, though. - [Suso chuckles] - You wanna race? - It's on. - [hens clucking] - [sheep bleating] [whimsical music playing] [man snoring] THE VISITORS ARE OUR FRIENDS - [boys chuckling] - [Rodri] See her face? [music increases in tempo] - [boys snickering] - [Suso] Shh. [Garriga] She's got an ax. - [Suso] Run! - [Garriga] Oh, Shit! [boys laughing] [Rodri] She almost got us. She was scary. [Garriga] I told you we shouldn't steal a sheet from that witch. [Maza] I bet she would've chopped us up with that ax if she caught us. This is the house, right? - [Garriga] What is it? - The house his dad fell off of. [somber music playing] [Suso breathing heavily] [grunting] [all grunting] [rocks clattering] [Garriga] Shit. - [glass shatters] - [Garriga] Run! [Suso] Garriga, run! - Garriga, let's go! - [Rodri] Hurry! [boys laughing] Should we eat here? Let's do the whole pool route. Then we can eat at the manor after. - Why not go to the waterfall? - What do you mean, the pool route? We swam in all these pools last summer when you were in the hospital. Yeah. Suso built five pools with his father, and we tried 'em all. - One by one. Tried 'em all. - [Suso] Give me that. You didn't say anything. Why? I don't know. So you wouldn't feel left out, that's all. Yeah. I've been missing out on so many things. No, you haven't. Most things we do aren't worth it. - Why are you saying that? Can't fool me. - [Suso] True. I have the feeling this pool route was a whole lot of fun. Swimming in all these nice houses sounds cool. - [Garriga] Really cool. - [Suso] Hm. - Why not do it again now? - [Garriga] I wanna start at the waterfall. - No. - The waterfall's way too cold. - [Suso] Oh, come on. - It's not that bad. [Garriga] Get him! [captivating music playing] [boys shouting excitedly] [chuckling] Look at this guy. [boys exclaiming] Yeah, go! [all cheering] [Rodri] Yeah! Yay! You did it! [chuckles] [Suso] That's right. Yeah! [Rodri] There you go. [Maza] Garriga! Jump, Garriga! [indistinct shouting] [all exclaiming] [Suso] Let's go! - [man] Outta my house, you rotten pests! - [boys] Oh, Shit! - [man] You're on private property! - [dogs barking] [man] Get outta my pool, you lousy punks! - Next time, I'll call the Civil Guard! - [Garriga] Hurry! - [Garriga] Hey, what is that? - [Maza] What? [boys chuckling] Oh, yeah? [boys chuckling] - [Álvaro] Nice work. - [Garriga] Maza? - [Maza] What? - The dog almost mauled you. Nah, dude, it's not like he would've bit me if he caught me. Why not? Because my karate sensei taught us to control energy. [boys chuckling] - Yeah, right. - [Maza] Before laughing, listen to me. If you concentrate completely and believe you won't get hurt, you can look it in the eyes and control it. - [Rodri laughs] - It's true. I mean, you just look him in the eyes and it won't hurt you. It won't do anything. Maza, I didn't believe all that karate talk. - But now, yeah. - [Rodri] No way. - [Maza] I'm serious, man. - You're such a bullshitter. [Maza] I'm not. You'll see. One day, I'll put my skill to use and you'll see. - You'll see if it works or not. - Damn. - Shit! - What's wrong? - I need to call my dad. - Don't. Fuck it. You know if there's a phone I can use, Suso? There's one inside. And how do I get in? [Álvaro] Look up there. There's an open window. It's a small climb, but you'll get in easy. - What? No way I'm climbing up there. - [Álvaro] Come on, it's easy. It is a little high, though. - It's not. You can make it. - [Álvaro] Come on. Don't be a chicken. - [Maza] It's a small climb. - Do it or your daddy will get angry. Garriga, quit it. One day, we'll have portable wireless phones. We won't have to go looking for one. - That's nonsense. - No way. [Suso] That's ridiculous. - It was in a science magazine. I read it. - Garriga knows his science stuff. - [Garriga] Yeah, I do. - [Maza chuckles] - You're a scientist? - [boys laugh] Psst. Hey, for real. You think he'll fall or not? - No, he won't. He'll be fine. - Garri's right. - I think he'll fall. - [Álvaro] Look at how he's climbing. - [Garriga] He's fine. - [Álvaro] He'll figure it. - [Maza] And up goes Rodri. - [Suso] Get us something to drink. - [Álvaro] Yeah, dude. - [Suso] There's a cabinet full of booze. - Are you really serious? - [Garriga] Get whiskey! - [Maza] Chips! - [Garriga] Whiskey! - And chips! Get us some potato chips. - [Álvaro] And some ice would be nice. - [Suso] Good call. Some ice! - [Maza] Something to eat. - [Garriga] Popcorn! - [Álvaro] Good idea. [Suso] He opened it. [Álvaro] Let's go. Let's go! Oh, shit, he's going in. [exhales] - [Suso] In he goes. - He made it in, didn't he? - I guess so. - I was sure he'd back out. Oh, hi, Grandma. Could you put Dad on the phone? Thanks. - I bet he won't bring us anything. - [Álvaro] Sure he will. [Garriga] If he brings anything, it'll be an empty bottle of whiskey. [all laughing] He'll get drunk in there. [Rodri] Yeah, I know. Calling doesn't cost anything. Yeah. Uh, sorry I forgot to give you my grades. I'll give 'em to you as soon as I'm back. Great. Yeah. Yeah, you bet. Love you. Bye. [mellow music playing] [Rodri] Hey, guys! - [Garriga] He's back. - [Álvaro] There's our man. [Maza] Oh, Rodri! - [all cheering] - [Álvaro] Well done, my friend. I'm not an expert, but I think this is booze. [Álvaro] Let's try it. - [Suso] Yeah. - [Garriga] Nice! [Suso] You get the first sip. [Garriga] That's good stuff. I can smell it from here. - [Maza] Don't be a baby. - Try it. - [Garriga] Smells great! - Try it. - [Suso] Chug! Chug! - [Garriga] Smells so good. [Suso] Nice. - Wow. - [Garriga] Oh, yeah! - [coughs] - [Suso] Like it? [boys laughing] [Álvaro] Careful there. [all speaking indistinctly] [boys chuckling] [Garriga] Massive. [exhales sharply] I always guess the priest penances in my school. It's like a gift. What do you mean? What's he do? The punishments. Says, because of impure thoughts, two weeks without mass. That's a good thing, no? No way. My dad doesn't pay allowances 'cause of that. - Ah, right. - [Maza] Okay, I get it. - He's tough on you. - [Garriga] Yeah. If you lied to your parents? - A whole creed, dude. - A creed? [Maza] Heels down. Now bend the knee. - Raise your foot. - [Garriga] I'm trying. Okay. Got it. - [Maza] Three, two, one… - [all] Hyah! That's it. Awesome. Wish the sensei could see. - [Maza and Garriga] Three, two, one… - [all] Hyah! [Garriga] Why not go to my friend's party? - Fuck. - Her town's just an hour away. I know we'll score if we go. I told you, Garriga, the only thing you'll score from her are dirty thoughts. - [all laughing] - I knew you'd say that. [Garriga] Pull harder! I can't do it! - [Garriga straining] - [Suso] Pull, Garriga! Come on! That's what I'm doing! [laughs] [Suso grunts] Come on! [Garriga] What'd your friends say about you going by Maza? - They don't call me Maza. They say Dani. - Dani? Yeah, Dani. The only people that call me Maza are you guys. I don't even know why you call us Maza and Álvaro. If we call the two of you Maza, we'd get confused. No? [all laughing] [Maza] Oh, my God. [Rodri] It's 3-3. Come on, come on! [boys chuckling] [Rodri] Block it! Block it! [Álvaro] Run, run, run! Get him! - [Rodri] Hey! Man down! - [Suso] Aah! [Garriga] Jump him! Jump him! [boys grunting] Garriga, no! Garriga! Garriga, get off! [Suso whispering] Maza. Wake up. Come on. - Maza. Wake up. - [Maza groans] Come on. [Maza shushing] - Wake up, Garriga. Let's go. - [Álvaro] What's going on? - [Maza] Just wake up Garriga. - [groans] [Álvaro grunts] Hey, Garriga. - [Garriga] Hey, stop! - [Suso] Garri, quiet! - [Rodri] Shh. Get up. - Why won't you let me sleep? - [Rodri] Come on. - [Maza] Garriga, quiet. What's the matter? [Álvaro] What's going on? What's wrong? Seriously, what's up? [Maza] I don't know. - What happened now? - [Suso] Shh. - [Rodri] How should I know? - It might just be birds, right? [ominous music playing] [distant droning] - [Rodri] What are you looking at? - I heard noises. Just stay quiet and stop talking. - [whispering] Hear anything? - [Rodri] What are we listening for? [gunshots] - [Suso] Shit! Run! Get outta here! - [all clamoring] [engines roaring] - [Maza] Oh, shit! - [Garriga] Let's go! Come on! [Suso] Faster, faster! [all clamoring] [dramatic music playing] Hurry, Álvaro! [Sioux 1] Hey! This way! This way! Aim well. We gotta get 'em. [gun firing] They're right ahead. There! [yelling] You bastards! [cows mooing] [Garriga] Hurry! Hey! Where are you going? [Suso] Come on. This way. [Maza] Hurry! Let's go! Come on! Run, run, run! [Álvaro] Come on! Quick, quick! [Garriga] Hurry! They're catching up. Go, go, go! - You have to pull! - Quick! - Let's go! - Oh, shit! - [Garriga] What's going on? - [Maza] Go, go! [Suso] I see 'em. Yeah, fuck you! [men shouting indistinctly] [Sioux boss] Shoot 'em! [boys speaking indistinctly] [Álvaro] Can't shoot for shit, Carrot Head! - Stupid losers. - [boys chuckle] We're gonna get you, little assholes! [Álvaro] What's the matter? Come on! [Suso] You'll die a really big loser. Stupid loser! [Garriga] You should really shower! - It's really comfy on this boat. - [boys chuckle] Carrot Head! [boys shouting indistinctly] - Screw you! - [Rodri] Screw you, dude! - Why don't you come get us? - We broke your motorcycles. Bunch of clowns! You pricks don't scare us. Fuck off. Mullet-head, want me to cut your hair? - [Rodri] Guys, I'm bleeding. - [Suso] You okay? - Hey, they shot Rodri. He's bleeding. - [Maza] Show me. - When did this happen? - [Rodri] Dunno. Show me. Let me see. - Holy shit! - [Suso] When did this happen? - Listen to me. We got to stitch it up. - You'll be okay. - We have to stitch it. We have to, Rodri. - What? No way you're gonna sew me up. - [Álvaro] Trust us. - [Maza] We'll figure it out. - How do we do this? - No. Don't touch it, Maza. - [Álvaro] What can we stitch it with? - [Rodri] No, please don't touch me. - [Maza] Look the other way. - I got my Rambo knife. [Suso] Don't wanna cut him. - [Garriga] What? - Is it a joke? No, of course not. It has needles and thread. - Quick, hand it over. - Hurry, hand it over. - Shit! - Let's do this. I'll take care… - Shh. - [Garriga] Stitch him up! [Maza] Hold still. You'll be fine. - [Rodri] Wait. - [Álvaro] Why not? It's fine. It's fine. I stitched a cow once. - Stop. You can't do this. I'm not a cow! - We have to. Yo, 'cause of karate, I got a really steady hand, so let me do it. - [Rodri] Fine. But do it quick. - [Maza] Listen to me. The sensei taught us self-control. You remember what I said about energies? If you concentrate, it won't hurt at all. - Just trust me. - No, you can't do it. Listen to me. We have to do this. If we don't do it, you'll have a bad infection for sure. You will lose your leg if that happens. - Suck it up and let me do it. - Yeah, trust him. - This won't hurt. Right, Maza? - [Maza] Not much. - It'll hurt a bit. - [Maza] Only hurt a little. - [Garriga] Bite into this. - [Suso] Bite it. - [Álvaro] You'll be fine. - [Garriga] Bite that. Look the other way. - [Maza] Hold on. - [Suso] You can do this. [Maza] I'll be quick. It's fine. No big deal. That bastard's hit. Damn right. - [Maza] On the count of three. - [Suso] You can do this. You're a champ. [Garriga] Slowly, okay? - [Suso] Shut up. The cow didn't even care. - [Maza] Hold on. Three… - [Garriga] You can do this. - [Rodri breathing heavily] [Garriga] Gently. [Álvaro] It's a piece of cake. - Aah! - [Garriga] What you doing? - What is it? - Fuck! I knew it'd be painful! [Álvaro] Of course it's gonna hurt. [all clamoring] You're such a show-off. Give me my needle. - What'd you say? - Karate this, karate that! What a bunch of stupid brats. They're something else. - You need to take it easy. - It's my body, my responsibility. [Sioux boss] Hey! That's enough! Either you come back here, or we're gonna throw one of your precious bikes in the water every ten seconds. - What? - [Garriga] No, no, no! Not our bicycles. Hell, no. - Not the bikes, no. - [Suso] They're bluffing. That's unfair. I'll count till ten, and the first bike we'll throw is yours. You hear, big fatso? No, no! You can't do that. Hey! - No, no, no! - Throw his in first. It's the oldest. Yes, yes, yes! We'll throw yours. Just watch us. One… We have to go back. He's really going to do it. Two… The red one. Three… - See what he's doing. Let's go. - It's just a bike. - Let's go back and apologize. - Who cares? It's a bike. - [all arguing] - Garriga, sit your ass down. Sit down. [Garriga] Fucking hell! Stop it! Yeah. Throw it, throw it, throw it! - [grunts] - Look at it fly! Bye-bye, bike. - Shit! - [gang boss] On with the second one. Let's go! Move it, move it, Carrot Head. Let's throw in the next one and move on to the next, and move on to the next. Watch it. That's it, Carrot Head. Garriga, they think they're so smart. If we go back there, they won't quit this bullshit. What now? Another one. Get another one and throw it in. - I want another one. Help him. - No. [Sioux boss] Eh, what now, kids? - [Rodri] No! - [Sioux boss] This one? [Rodri] Not that one! Look, look, look. Look at it fly, man! Oh! The blue one has flown. Which one now? Yeah, the last one. - Whoo! - [man] Last one. Come on, grab the last one. - One more. - The last one! [gang boss] That's it. Go diving, stupid losers! No more bikes for you, cuties. What's wrong? - [Suso] Assholes! - Assholes! - [Sioux 2] What? - Huh? What now? [Sioux 2] Yeah, what you gonna do with no bikes, huh? - So, karate... - Stop talking. Listen, Garriga, stop being so annoying. Just shut up already. - [Álvaro] Let's all shut up. - Bullshit! - [Garriga] Relax. Keep a steady hand. - Shut the fuck up. [Garriga] Energies… Let's go to the other side. [engine sputters] [engine starts] We'll find you boys and make you suffer. - We're gonna find you, better believe it. - [Sioux 2] That's right! - [Álvaro] Where do we get out? - [Suso] At that rock. When we're close, I'll turn off the boat's engine. - Careful. Shouldn't we go right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Garriga] Watch out. Turn off the engine. - [Álvaro] It's okay. We're fine. Hey, grab that branch. Reach for it. [Suso] No, the rock. The rock. Go to the other side. You can't climb up that way. [Rodri] Let's see if it's possible here. [Garriga] Watch it. Hang on to that. - Careful, Álvaro. Hang on. - [Álvaro] I'm fine. [Suso] This is the sketchy part. Let's stick together and stay calm. Okay? [men arguing] [somber music playing] - Let's go further down. - Okay. - [dog barking] - [men continue arguing] [man 1] Stop! I don't have any money! - [man 1] No, please! Please! Aah! - [men grunting] [man 2] Let go of it! Let go! [indistinct chatter] - [man 3] Hey, what are you doing here? - [woman 2 exclaims] [man 3] Come here. [baby crying] Is that a baby crying? - [crying continues] - [Álvaro] Isn't anyone looking after it? - Suso. - [Garriga] Suso, don't go in there. - [Rodri] Suso. What are you doing? - [Garriga] Stop, Suso. [baby fussing] - [Rodri] What are you doing? - [Garriga] Don't go in there. - We're in big trouble now. It's awful. - Don't tell me that. Tell Suso. [baby crying] [whispering] We have to go. We have to go! - [Rodri] Álvaro, what are you doing? - You serious? - No, no, enough. - [Rodri] Stop. Álvaro. [Garriga] She's dead. I'm outta here. - [Rodri] No. Garri. - What? - Don't go. You can't leave us here. - She's dead. All together always. - [Garriga] Then let's all go. - [Rodri] All together always. - There's no pulse. - She's dead. We have to leave. - Stick with us. - [Álvaro] What's going on? - Take the spoon, okay? - We have to leave. - That woman is dead. We gotta leave. - No, we're not leaving. - Hey, Álvaro, what are you doing? - Don't touch the baby. Don't take it. [Rodri] Don't pick her up, Álvaro. - Álvaro. - Leave the little girl there. - Álvaro. - [Álvaro shushing] - What are you doing? - [Garriga] Let's go. - Leave it. - We can't just leave her here. [baby fussing] - [Garriga] What you doing? - It's fine. [Rodri] Let's get outta here. There's nothing you can do. The baby is coming. - [Garriga] Insane. - [Maza] We can't take care of her. - Off we go. - [Álvaro] We can. [indistinct chatter] [captivating music playing] - [Álvaro] Let's stop here. Okay? - [Suso] Yeah. Shit. Careful. - [Álvaro] Garri, pass the milkshake. - Yeah, okay. Don't give her too much. [Garriga] Here. And here, take the spoon. Wipe it first though. Wipe it well. [baby fussing] Could you open it? I'll take it from there. Open it and just put a few drops here. Just a bit of it. Like that. Like that. Do you want some? You hungry? Do you like it? Not really how I expected to get a girl in our group, huh? But, uh, I'm okay with it. [Rodri] Yeah. Yeah, but, Álvaro, don't you think that we should report this to the police? Imagine if her mother isn't really dead, we'd get in big trouble. How'd the police be able to help her right now? How would they? They'd probably put her in a juvie center or something awful like that. What's our plan, though? Can't bring her to the mountain with us. - I think we should go back, okay? - No way. We're not gonna do that. We'll take her with us and drop her off at the hospital. We have to go back. We don't know how to take care of a baby. The only thing I know is they have to drink every three or four hours. Besides, what if her mom isn't dead? What if it was just a bad trip and she's all right? We stole her baby. [sighs] Maza, the mother overdosed. She's dead. We saw it. Even if she survived, what life would she give this kid? Her life would be awful, but we have no right to take that kid away. We'll take care of her like we take care of each other. We'll do it, like it or not. - What's done is done. - Exactly. That's it. She's one of us now. We'll take care of her, and that's it. - Everyone agree? - [Garriga] Yes. - [Álvaro] Yes. - [Rodri] Yeah. - Maza? - Hmm? This is such a mess. - [Garriga] It is. - We need to give her a pretty name. - Hope is nice. - "Hope"? That's ridiculous. - [Álvaro] Why? - It's for grandmas. - [Álvaro scoffs] - [Garriga] I have an aunt called Hope. - [chuckling] - [Garriga] And she has a mustache. I swear. When she gives me a kiss, it scratches me. - She even smells old. - You and your stories, Garri. It's perfect, Álvaro. Hope. All right. We should go. Let's gather all our stuff. - [Garriga] Let's go. - Can't waste time. - [Suso] Give it. - [Hope fussing] - [Rodri] Guys, let's go. Let's go. - [Suso] You keep it. [Rodri] Come on. Do you think he's right? You think the plant can cure people? Why are you asking? If it's a real cure, it could help me get smarter, right? [Maza scoffs] Maybe I could stop failing every single class. - Still don't know how to tell my parents. - Yeah? Which classes? [Maza] Let me see. - How many fails? More than usual? - Oh, shit. - I think it's a new record. - Oh, yeah. - Seven classes. - Oh, well. You're living up to your reputation. - Did you see the note? - No. - Don't read it. - Listen to this. - "Should repeat the grade…" - [Álvaro] So? "…because he needs to assimilate everything twice." - He hates me. - Yeah, he's… - He's calling you stupid, dude. - Poor guy. You can't even show that to your parents. Can't do it. - Won't I have to? - Forge your report card. How can I forge it? Your mother's signature. Know how to do it? Find it somewhere, look at it real good and imitate it. - They won't know anything. - Don't do what he says. It's a really bad idea. You should do the same thing as me. Getting sick saved my grades. I used to get awful grades. I used to get a whole lot of Cs, and I got Ds too. Now I only get straight As. They don't have guts to fail a boy who's dying... Stop it. Can you stop talking about dying? - So what? - [Maza] We all know you're sick. You don't have to keep bothering us with your sob stories. It's no bother. It's fine. It was a joke. Not so bad if you hear his joke once, but if you hear him all day, every day, it's annoying. Try living with this and talk to me. - For real? Yeah? - [Álvaro] Yeah. - Bring it. - [Álvaro] What? I want to find that plant, and I hope you manage to drink all of its potion, because I'm dreading the day Mom and Dad will find your dead body. Every time they look at me after that, they'll see you. That's what's gonna happen, right? What's the matter, huh? What? Suddenly it isn't all that funny anymore, is it? Yeah, I'm laughing about it. Really fucking funny, dude, Maza. Álvaro. Guys. - [Garriga] They coming or what? - [Suso] Mm. - You all right? - [Álvaro] Yeah, fine. - [Suso] Are you sure? - Fine. Yeah. [Garriga sighs] Yeah, well, I think the twins seem a little tense. We should go to the party. Again, really? Come on, Suso. We've been walking all day long. We're exhausted. I think we should all take a break and party a little. We've got to pick the flower before sunrise, okay? - We can't bring this girl to a party. - We have enough time. We don't have to stay for long. As far as the baby goes, we shouldn't be feeding her chocolate shakes. We need to get her milk. You're a pain in the ass with that girl's party. I doubt she even cares about you. Maybe she doesn't care now, but I got to give it a shot. - [Álvaro chuckles] - What's so funny? - [all chuckling] - Come on, let's go to that party. - Come on. - Let's go for a while. Let's go dance. [mimics dance beats] - If you want to. - Let's dance a little bit. - What town is it in? Is it far? - Ten minutes away. - Ten minutes? - That's so close. - We can go. - [Garriga] Come on. Let's go. Come on. - [Suso] We can take a shit there too. - We won't. We'll stink up the whole house. - And I want to fit in. - Fine. We can dance a bit, but when I say we go, we go. - All right! - Party, Garriga. - Party, yeah! Let's go! - Oh, my God! - [Suso] Watch the baby. - [Garriga] Of course. Let's go party! Come on! Awesome! [Álvaro] You know this is the shortest night of the year, right? [Garriga] Sure. Midsummer's Eve. Why? [Álvaro] Because you said ten minutes and we've been walking for 40. We won't make it. [Maza] Álvaro, wait. I wanna talk with my brother. [Hope cooing] - So, um... - What's wrong? I'm sorry for what I said earlier on. I shouldn't have yelled at you. Don't worry, okay? It's all right. I'm… [sniffles] …really afraid. Really afraid of you not being around anymore. I don't want to go a day without you. I… [sniffles] I don't want to lose you. I can't live without you. I'm scared. I'm scared. [Álvaro] I'm right here. Don't worry, Dani. - I love you so much. - [Maza sobs] I love you so much. I love you so much, Álvaro. [Maza sobbing] [Álvaro] I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here. [Maza] I'm scared of losing you. I'm so scared of losing you, Álvaro. [Maza sobbing] [baby coos] [Álvaro] I'm here. [insects trilling] [Suso] Look at him. - [Álvaro] Yeah, man. - [Maza] What if we hadn't come? [Rodri] He'd bug us for the whole trip. [Garriga] Gotta take risks. And we can all take a shit here, right? Aren't we on a camping trip? So take a shit in a bush. So, what's your plan with the girl? I'm gonna say hi to her and… [sniffs] she'll smell me. I stole some cologne from my dad. I saw an ad for it. - It said that it drives girls crazy. - [chuckling] And I'll leave a little of my scent. - We'll take a dump here. - Stop with the dump talk. We'll leave our scent here. She'll remember us forever. You're not taking a shit here. [Maza] You suck. - Watch out. Watch out. - [Hope coos] [Suso] Wow, he's even combing his hair. [Hope fussing] - How's my hair? - You look amazing. - Really good. - Yeah, man, you look great. - [Maza] So mature. - You'll rule the party. What about Hope? What we do with her? - Rodri, I need a backpack. - A backpack? Want Garri's? Yeah. Hey, open it wide. - In there? - I'll make sure no one sees. - Careful when you put her in. - [Garriga] Someone's coming. [Hope fussing] [Álvaro] Whoa! So many babes here. - [Rodri] Pay attention. - [Álvaro] What? - [Suso] Watch her head. - It's a party. - [Garriga] Get it over with. - [Maza] All right. - [Garriga] Come on. - She gonna be all right like that? I'll find some milk for Hope and we go. - [Garriga] Okay. - Got it? - I'm going. - When you see her, kiss her right away. - Don't talk to her. - Straight-up kiss her? I've never kissed anyone. Garri, I've already kissed three girls. You just have to say, "Massive balls." - "Massive balls." - Massive balls. - Are you serious? - [Garriga chuckles] You know what I'm talking about, right? It's a tactic. When you lean in to kiss her, place your lips as if you were gonna say "massive." - [Garriga] Massive. - That's it. When you put your tongue in there, say "balls." - My tongue in where? - What are you talking about? - Put your tongue in her mouth. - I won't. You kidding? But you have to put your tongue in. - [Garriga] I'm not doing that. - What's wrong with you? [band playing upbeat Spanish song] [Suso] Hey, where's the kitchen? It's there. Yo, Suso, don't take a shit here. Seriously. - [chuckling] - [Álvaro] Do it. Do it. Are you seeing this? [Rodri exhales] - My God. - My, oh, my. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] So, which girl's yours? - Where is she, Garri? - She's there. The one in pink. [Álvaro] She's pretty cute. - [Rodri] Yeah, dude. - [Maza] Yeah. - [people cheering] - Hey! [Hope fussing] ["Take On Me" playing on speakers] Remember what I said. Massive balls. - Massive balls, got it? - Go for it. - [Álvaro] Come on, man. - [Rodri] She looks really into music. - If you can call this crap music. - [chuckles] - Don't you play the guitar? Go for it. - No, not the guitar. - Let's get a drink. - [Maza] All right. [Álvaro] I'm hungry too. [Hope fussing] [indistinct chatter] [girls laughing] - [girl 1] Hey, guys. - [girl 2] Hi! You look great. - Holy shit. They're twins? - They're twins, bro. - [Maza] I know. - [Rodri] She just checked you out. - Huh. - Yeah, boy. [fussing] Garriga, they're flirting with her. - Go make a move. - [Maza] Do it now. - No, I don't. Not yet. - Then I'll seduce her. - Go ahead. - Should we just stay here? Don't fuck around.

You rocked it, man. - [indistinct chatter] Hey, weren't you in my class this year? Yeah. Garriga. Right. So, Barriga, I'd like it if you stop playing the drums like a crazy person or my neighbors will call my parents to complain. It's "Garriga," but "Barriga" can work as well. - Okay, fine. Sorry. I'll stop. - [girl] Great. [chuckles softly] - Can you get up? - Ah. Of course. [Rodri] Don't worry about it.

No, uh, not at all. - No, I… I don't use cologne. - No? - Well, I just put a tiny bit on. - "A bit."

Garriga, it really stinks. - It's coming from the bathroom. - Rocío? What? What? Well, um, I, uh… I have to tell you something, and I'm not sure how. [Rocío] What is it? Tell me. Well, uh, I want to say that… [Rocío] What? - [Garriga] I just want to say that… - Yes? Spending this time with you is the best time I've had in a very long time. And I think you're the most wonderful person in our class and… I… Well, if I wasn't such a coward about it, I'd have the guts to… [sighs] I would try to kiss you, but I'm just a big loser, I guess.

Garriga went through with it. - What? - [Suso] He kissed her. - That girl? - The one he likes. [bike engines revving] What gives? [upbeat music playing on speakers] - What is it? - [Garriga] The Sioux are here. - Sioux? - Punks from my neighborhood. - [Rocío] What punks? - They want to kill me and my friends. - What do you mean? - I have to hide from the Sioux. [Rocío] But… Hey, watch it! [Sioux boss] There's a bald one and a fat one. I have a feeling they're here. You sure you haven't seen 'em? No? We're gonna take a look around. - [Garriga] Guys, the Sioux! - [Carrot Head] Isn't that them? I see 'em. Come on, grab 'em! Out of the way! [girl] Hey, what are you doing? [clamoring] - [Rodri] Run, Maza. - [Sioux boss] Hey, you brats! [motorcycle engines revving] [Álvaro] Turn around. [boys coughing] You believe a bunch of losers like you could get away from us? What do you want? I'm sick of wasting time with you. Which one of you can beat me? - I will. - Stop, man. - I'm gonna fight. - No, Álvaro. No. - No way. No. - [Álvaro] Yes. [chuckling] You're a sick boy, so, no. I may be sick, but that guy that thought about cutting your face with that boomerang was me. - I don't wanna fight you. - I don't have anything contagious. Maybe you are contagious, maybe you aren't contagious, but everyone knows you won't be around for long. You'll be dead soon. Prick! The boss of the punks, the leader of the Sioux. Are you afraid? You're not so tough now, huh? I'm not afraid. - You afraid of a kid with cancer? - [Sioux boss] I'm not afraid. [Álvaro] Reminds me of that time I was at the pool. - You're as chickenshit as your family... - Don't talk about my family! - [Álvaro] Yeah. - Off-limits. At the pool, they all got two meters away. What? You're as chicken as your family. Do not mention my family. My family's off-limits. The chickenshits are your friends sending some fucking cancer boy to fight me? Baldy, look at me. Look at me. You smell like rot. You're gross. Quit it, asshole! You're a piece of dirt. Your stupid look sucks. Why do you look like that? It's just a front, 'cause you're nothing. - Back off. - Your mullet's no match for my bald head. - I'm not dying. - Don't get closer. I have a great life, thanks to these friends and my family. They take care of me. It sucks to be in the hospital so much, but they support me. - Get away. - You don't have that. No one cares about you, right? - What? What's the matter? - [Sioux boss] Back off. I'm afraid of dying, but I know it won't be alone. [Álvaro spits] - [Sioux boss] What the fuck? - [crowd clamoring] [both grunting] - [girl] What's going on? Stop. - [Hope crying] [girl] Stop. What's going on? Stop it! He's gonna kill him. Someone go in there. Stop it now! Someone go in there. Stop it! Hey, stop! [Rodri] Maza! - [Sioux boss groans] - [Maza] You can't touch my brother! - [Sioux boss] Okay. - [Maza] Okay? Got it? - Screw you! - [Rodri] Maza, let's go. - [Maza] Don't touch my brother. - Yes. I don't ever want to see you again. - Let's go. - Leave us alone, you shit. - [Rodri] Let's go. - You bully. Just leave us alone. [Hope fussing] - [Suso] Nice. - Grab onto me. Careful. Hold him up on the other side, Rodri. Get your hands off! [panting] Get your hands off. [indistinct chatter] [spits] What are you looking at? All of you stink here! [bike engines revving] [insects trilling] [Suso] Watch it with Álvaro. [Garriga] Slower. You're going way too fast. Easy does it. Easy does it. [Rodri] Careful. [Álvaro coughing] You okay, Álvaro? Yeah, better. We should really go home. - [Álvaro sighs] - Yeah, we should do that. No. No, we have to go pick the flower for your dad. - We have to find it. - You're much too weak, though. I'm not, Maza. All together always, right? We need to find that flower. Thank you, my friend. [Álvaro] Of course. Give me a bit of it. [Maza] Drink. - [Álvaro sighs] - [Garriga chuckles] You know, that guy almost killed you, huh? [boys chuckling] [Álvaro] Good thing I had Maza-san to defend me. I think that's the last party we go to for a while. [all laughing] Don't know about that. Yeah, speak for yourself. I'm fine. - [chuckling] - Yeah, you are. - [Garriga chuckling] - The womanizer. We should make a fire if we're staying. - [Maza] Yeah, we have to. - [Rodri] Hm. Then we can jump over it together. - Sure. Three times and we make a wish. - Let's do it. [upbeat music playing] - [Suso] All right, Garriga! - [Maza] Three, two, one! [Rodri] Yeah, Garri! Go! [Álvaro] Go! [Garriga] It burns! [boys cheering] - [Álvaro] Come on, Rodri! - [Garriga] Jump! Go! - [Álvaro] Yeah! - [Suso laughs] [Garriga] This is so awesome! [indistinct chatter] [Suso] All for one! On Midsummer's Eve, it's said that everything you throw in the fire, you leave behind. We should throw everything in there, right? [sighs] [Suso] What are you gonna do? - Oh, shit! [laughs] - Yes! All right! - You got to take risks. - You're a tough guy, Rodríguez. That was so amazing. - [Maza] That was awesome. - [Garriga] Legend. - [Suso] Why'd you do that, though? - Why wouldn't I? - [boy chuckles] - [Garriga] What? - [Suso] What's going on? - [Maza] So bad. Hope is confused about what you did. - [Maza] Totally. What's up? - [Garriga] She's so cute. - [Maza chuckling] Look at her. - [boys chuckling] [sighs] What a day, huh? So crazy. The best day of my life. You got that right. My brother kicked that Sioux guy's ass, wow. And I cut his hair off. - Yeah. - And my firecrackers. - Great stuff, Garriga. - Firecrackers. Yeah, and we got drunk for the first time too. Right, guys? Yeah, and we have a girl in our crew now. [both chuckle] - And I had my first kiss tonight. - Yeah. [boys] Yeah! The heartbreaker. - She's the one that kissed you. I saw it. - Oh, yeah? The way it happened is really not important. What are you saying? Of course it matters. I passed my math class and not you. - Low blow! - It'll matter when your father finds out. That's fine, now the situation's under control. - That's what you think. - Got to take risks. - Yeah, you do. - Got that right. [Garriga] Attaboy, Rodri. That's so true. [chuckles] [Hope cooing] [Suso whispering] Don't worry. Sweet dreams, Hope. Nothing's gonna happen to you. [chuckles softly] When we find the flower, we'll take you to the hospital. That's where they'll find you a great new family. But until then, we'll watch over you. [Hope cooing] [somber music playing] [Maza] Hey, Suso! Suso, come here, please. Here. [whispering] All right. [Maza] Wake up, Garri. [whispering] Garri? Garriga. Wake up. Come on. - [Suso] And this? - Give it. Give it here. [Rodri whispering] Maza. What's wrong? What's the matter? I… [Garriga] Maza, what is it? Uh, in ten days, Álvaro is gonna get his arm chopped off. Why would he need it chopped off? He didn't want you to know 'cause he wanted our adventures to be his, uh, goodbye trip. Every single night, I have to measure it to see the tumor's size. Did the chemo make it shrink, or is it still the same? And it's always, always, always 43 cm. Always the same. [Garriga sighs] But don't you, uh… Don't say anything to him. He doesn't want you to know about it. Now you know… Now you know why he's so sensitive these days. But, uh, will he make it? All we know now is they need to cut off his arm. [Maza sighs] [Suso] It'll be fine, Maza. [Maza] Don't tell him anything. - [Garriga] Don't worry. - [Rodri] We won't say a thing. [Hope fussing] Pick it. - [Suso] Take this, Rodri. - [Rodri whispering] It's so cold. [Maza] Don't break it, okay? [Rodri] Take the ones Maza gives you, Álvaro. - [Álvaro] Maza, take this. - [Maza] Mm. [Álvaro] A little more. [Rodri] Put them in the bottle, Álvaro. Put 'em in. [Suso] Watch it. Don't drop any of them. [Rodri] So what now? Can we all take a sip before bringing it to your dad? - Is that all right? - [Suso] Of course. - Who's first? - Yeah. - [both chuckle] - [Suso] Wait. Hold on. I think we should give our shares to Álvaro. He needs more strength. - Do you all agree? - Yes. Yes. - You really sure? - [Garriga] Of course, man. - [Suso] Drink up. - [Garriga] Drink it. Thanks a lot. Now we need to bring Hope to the hospital. - How far is it from us? - Three hours, minimum. - That's far. - We'll be walking too. Listen to me. Álvaro's not doing great. We can't walk that long. - What do you mean? I feel perfectly well. - [Maza] You sure? - I'm fine. - Wait, wait, wait. I've got a really good idea. [whimsical music playing] [engine rumbling] [Garriga] Hey, guys. [door creaks shut] [babies crying] [door opens] [door closes] [imperceptible] - That's it. We're here. - All right. Everything will be fine. - Come on, sweetie. - See ya. [Rodri] All right, Hope. That's your stop. [babies crying] Let's set her here. Sweet little Hope. [Hope cooing] [whispering] Bye, Hope. TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER. HER NAME IS HOPE. [cooing] [respirator whirring] [whispering] Papa, we're gonna give you a remedy, okay? I need help, Maza. [solemn music playing] [Suso] I took care of the Casebios' pool yesterday. I followed your instructions. I did the job well. Mom's hard on me. But I do it all for you. It's… what you would want. [sniffing] I just wish you would talk to me. All of us are hurting so bad. But it doesn't matter to me, Dad. [breath shaking] [crying] Because I love you so much. So much. [sobbing] [sniffles] I love you so, so much. I don't want you to… to go. I don't want you to leave us. You've always said that nature is knowledge. So we made you this magic potion… because I don't know how… I don't know how to live without you, Dad. [sobbing] I don't want you to die, Dad. Because I can't do everything alone. I'm begging you. I'm begging you, please, please. Dad… I'm begging you, Dad. Please, Dad. Please, Dad. Daddy… All right, guys. We made it home safely. Topping this year's trip won't be easy, huh? - Yeah, I doubt I'll get to try. - Yeah, well, Álvaro… You're strictly prohibited to die, okay? [boys chuckling] Don't you worry about that, Garri. I'll be fine. I'm stronger than an ox now. We'll have trouble trying to top this, but I know we'll manage. We always do, don't we? And when we get to talk about this to your dad, he'll be blown away. - Yeah, he will. - Yeah, man. Well, see you soon. - Guys. - Álvaro. All together always. [all] All together always! - Hug! - [Álvaro] Love you, guys. Our crew rules! Well, we should go. We still have some walking to do. - [Suso] Yes. - Hold on. Wait a sec. [Maza] What's up? We got to go. What's that? You serious, Garri? Don't get used to this, Maza-san. [Maza] Thanks a lot, man. - [Garriga] Sure thing. - [Maza] Hold up. [Garriga chuckles] Buitre is yours now. - [Maza] Here. - Let's see. - Thanks so much. - You're too old to... [Maza] Shut up. Don't get used to me giving you cards you want. - I know. - Twin brothers. Let's go. I got to bring back the tractor. - See you soon. Take care. - Garriga. [Garriga] Take care. - See ya, Rodri. - Álvaro. [Garriga] Bye, man. - Next year, don't fail so many classes. - [chuckles] I won't. [Álvaro] Bye, Suso. It was great seeing you. - [Maza] Let's go. Come on. - [Rodri] All right, guys. [Maza] Let's go, guys. - Love you, bro. - [Garriga] See you. [Álvaro] Take care. - You too. - [Suso] Bye. - [Maza] Let's go. - See you in Alcorcón, Suso. - [Rodri] Bye! - [Suso] Bye. By the way, you don't need a potion or anything. You're a good guy. You know, my father says intelligence is a gift, and what matters is choosing kindness. Hm. Wait. Here. This is for you. Because the best thing about leaving is coming back. [both chuckle] You know, there's a saying that we have around here. A reminder not to put up with people's bullshit. - It's… - Hmm? Assholes are full of it. - Come on, say it. - Assholes are full of it. Assholes are full of it. Louder. - Assholes are full of it. - Assholes are full of it. Assholes are full of it! - All right, remember… - [both] Assholes are full of it. [Rodri] Mom, Dad, I have to talk to you about something. - ["Live Is Life" playing] - [crowd cheering] [crowd clapping to the beat] ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ All together now ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ [whoops] ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ [scats] ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ When we all give the power ♪ ♪ We all give the best ♪ ♪ Every minute of an hour ♪ ♪ Don't think about the rest ♪ ♪ Then you all get the power ♪ ♪ You all get the best ♪ ♪ And everyone gives everything ♪ ♪ And every song everybody sings ♪ ♪ Then it's life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life When we all feel the power ♪ ♪ Live is life Come on, stand up and dance ♪ ♪ Live is life When the feeling of the people ♪ ♪ Live is life Is the feeling of the band, yeah! ♪ ♪ When we all give the power ♪ ♪ We all give the best ♪ ♪ Every minute of an hour ♪ ♪ Don't think about the rest ♪ ♪ Then you all get the power ♪ ♪ You all get the best ♪ ♪ And everyone gives everything ♪ ♪ And every song everybody sings ♪ ♪ Then it's life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ [scats] ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ [scats] ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na-na ♪ ♪ And you call when it's over ♪ ♪ You call it should last ♪ ♪ Every minute of the future ♪ ♪ Is a memory of the past ♪ ♪ 'Cause we all gave the power ♪ ♪ We all gave the best ♪ ♪ And everyone gave everything And every song ♪ ♪ Everybody sang ♪ ♪ Live is life ♪ [crowd cheering]
