The supermarket here is more in stock than those in the typhoon shelter. - I begged your uncle until he sold it to me. - Dad is boasting again. But I am awesome. Let me have a look. What has become of the store? You've been fooled again! Come on in. I'll turn on the lights first. The stocks are all here. Check them and we'll wrap up the deal. The store will be yours. This place stinks. It makes my hair smelly. - Nam! - Dad! The store doesn't look like the same. I don't want it, cousin. This is business, not a game. - Are you trying to rip me off? - You checked before agreeing to buy. The store didn't look like this before! What do you expect for this price? People say men shouldn't kneel down easily, but I don't care. I'm kneeling down in front of you. - I beg you. I plead you. - I'm just a shareholder. - Please give me back my savings! - I'm not in charge. - Please give it back to me... - Let go of me! You lied to me... "How many friends can you have in your life..." - Bastard! - "How many friendships can last..." Stop there! How dare you cheat us? Watch this! "May friendship stay in our hearts" how are things, may? Dad is on his harmonica again. Let me call the mental hospital. Dad! Dear Buddha, I didn't listen to you and lost six consecutive times. I've lost everything this week. Dear Buddha, please inspire me so that I can bet on the winning horse. The fortune slip says there's a golden opportunity. Your bad luck is leaving, good things are coming. Your luck is starting to change. It also says you'll find it where you least expect it. Congrats, miss. You'll meet your Mr. Right. I'm asking about my family. Plus, I don't have a boyfriend. Your Mr. Right is just out there. This Buddha is really something. I'm castrated, and I can still have a son. - Have a cigar. - Thanks. Don't draw on it so hard. You'll get high easily. My eye is twitching and my back is itching. Is someone talking behind my back? You'll meet your Mr. Right soon. It's hot! Watch out! Miss! Let go of the steering wheel! Stop the car! Help! Miss! My neck! Water! Back off! I need water! - Oh, no! What a big accident. - How did that happen? Someone's hurt. Her leg is hurt. Miss, you've hurt your leg. Don't move. I want to pick up my shoe. Let me help you. Just stay here. Just go. You're tall enough. You don't need these pads. - Miss, your shoe... - Don't drive if your neck is hurt! - It wasn't like this before. - Don't try to explain! It's all right now, but it hurts. My leg hurts too! What should we do now? Take me to the hospital. - Let's go. - How can I? Can't you see my leg is hurt? I'll carry you. I'll treat my neck and you'll treat your leg. - You're so heavy. - Up there. A hurt man holding a crippled girl. Why am I in such a predicament? - What did you say? - Nothing. Stop mumbling. If my injury is serious, I'll make you pay. Doctor, my leg hurts. You've had muscular dystrophy since you were little. Yes, doctor. My right leg is half an inch shorter. Will it get shorter? The wound is near your ligament. I don't know how this will affect you. We'll need to observe it. - Heho? - Heho? Is this may yau's home? Yes. Are you looking for may? She's not home. I'm her dad. What's the matter? I'm calling from the hospital. Hospital? Mr. Yau, don't get nervous. I'm not. I'm not nervous at all. I'm using a cell. The battery is running out soon. Who are you? I... I'm Joe leung. I... What do you want? I want to tell you... There's magnetic interference. I can't hear you on my mobile. When are you coming? I'm not coming. You're on your own. I can't make such a big decision for you. Hello? Mr. Yau? What are you looking at? What a loony! The patient needs to be hospitalized. Doctor, how's she? - She needs to stay in for observation. - Okay. Take her to fill in the papers. Miss yau, I've called your home. Why do you have my number? I saw it at the registration counter. What did my dad say? He told me to decide for him. Decide for what? Your dad is such a chicken. His daughter is in hospital and he asked a stranger to decide for him. He said the cell battery was running out and hung up on me. - Your dad is a bit round the bend. - You're round the bend! To hell with you! Miss yau! If she had been run over, - that would have saved lots of trouble. - What did you say? I'm sorry. - Joe leung. - Yes. Officer, you look familiar. Cut that crap. I meet people like you every day. Look at you. You're disgusting. It's not safe to let you drive. I'll definitely revoke your license. You shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I'm a taxi driver. If you revoke my license, I'll be in trouble. I'm also in trouble because of you. What's done is done. It's too late now. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't need to be here today. You're talking black into white. We have so much to deal with when we drive. Our hands are on the steering wheel. Our legs have to control the accelerator, clutch and brake. Road signs may suddenly be altered. There are traps everywhere. Also, you guys may suddenly come out and take a picture of us when we're speeding. What about me? I often hide behind trucks of pigs and wait for you to go to the toilet in order to issue a ticket. What for? For a living. You're right. We all work for a living. Your charges are attempt to tamper with evidence - officer! - And deliberately moving the injured. I was trying to save her life! Were you? If she dies, you'll be charged with manslaughter. What? Manslaughter? Sit down! No! I've sat too long! You were driving without insurance when you killed her. Isn't this manslaughter? Officer, mind your words. She's still alive in hospital. - Are you trying to frame me? - Sit down. Just like the case of the university student. She committed suicide because of you guys. It was a trivial matter just like my case. My insurance expired for two days only. The girl hasn't sued me. Why would you? Did you mean I'd set you up? You've even put down "manslaughter". Aren't you framing me? Don't you think so? If the strike of taxi drivers was successful, you wouldn't even a job. Are you mocking me? No. You said it yourself. If I were mocking you, you wouldn't even food to eat! - I'll charge you with assault. - What? You call this an assault? If you put that down, I'll jump out of this window. You've all heard. This is his own decision. It has nothing to do with me. - Go ahead. We'll be your witnesses. - Shut up! Help me look clearly at his face. If the media ask why I jumped, tell them that it was caused by this bastard. Although we're young... I like you. I know you'll back me up. Bastard, what's your number? Pc5726, I'll remember you. I'll come back to haunt you. - Back off. - Don't jump. Stay calm. Don't touch me. Don't play games with me. No, officer. I really have hurt my back. Just forget it. - It hurts. - What's up? Back off! - It hurts! - Get them out. Get out! How come a toilet break would cause this chaos? - Are you okay? - Don't move me. I've hurt my back. - Just a traffic accident. Nothing much. - What does that mean? We can discuss. - Really? - Yes. - We really can discuss? - Yes. Get up first. I'm okay now. Is her room here? - Room 608. - This is room 604. - So this is room 6... - Stupid. It's the next one. Next one? Okay. This is it. Who are you looking for? Miss may ya... - Yes. - So you're visiting my daughter. - Are you Mr. Yau? - Yes. - Greet him. - Uncle. Well, who are you? I'm Joe leung. Who are you? I called you and asked you not to get nervous. It was you! I wasn't nervous at all. It's hard to find a young man like you. - Come in. - Okay. - Mr. Yau, you're quite a driver. - Of course. Is he loony? It doesn't matter as long as he signs the settlement. - What's wrong? - There are stones. There are stones! Turn! His condition is quite serious. All the easier to deal with. Uphill now. Turn. Why have you stopped? There's... Radar. Daughter, you're up already? How could I sleep with all the noises you made? I have something important to talk to them. Can you go out for a while? Okay. Remember to pull the hand brake. Why are you here? He's my elder brother. Hi, miss yau. My name's sea. He said he wanted to visit you. We've bought you something. Put them down. Here are some magazines. Your shoe has been mended. Don't play Mr. Nice guy! How's your leg? Are you blind? I'm crippled! I know how you feel. If a friend of yours hurts her leg, you wouldn't expect her to recover at once. But after she has recovered, you won't remember that she was ever wounded. Are you taking pleasure in my pain? No. I just want to find out what responsibility I should bear. If you're so responsible, why don't you work as a social worker? Miss yau, do you know what's it like to feel guilty? My brother couldn't sleep well. He couldn't breathe. Yes. I'm still not feeling well inside. You're nuts. You said my young brother is nuts? Your family are all nuts! - How can you say that to miss yau? - Go away! - Go away! Go away! - Miss yau... - Calm down, miss yau. - I don't want to see you! - Miss yau. - Go away! - Go away! - You have such a quick temper. - Miss yau. - Go away! - We bought it. - Miss ya... - Go away! - Miss yau, see you. - Goodbye, old lady. - Go away! Enjoy the show. Get this money and take away my tickets. Get my money and take away my bad luck. This is sticky rice and this is normal rice. Everyone has rice, money. Let me drive smoothly on the road. Let nothing disturb my passengers. Let no cats or dogs go in my way. Let may yau recover soon. Thank you, earth gods. "Our glorious homeland is in turmoil" "our lovely lakes are filled with sorrow" "in the mainland" "many noble spirits have risen" "we're determined to convert our suffering" "into fuel that drives us to success" "we are brave Chinese" "whose Chinese spirit has been awaken" "we will act in unity" "and fear no difficulty" "to break through darkness" nice! - Are you through? - Yes. - Then give me a plaster. My neck hurts. - Okay. Joe, can I take part in a show now? Wait till you've become "representative". - Lightly. - Joe, we'd better settle the case quickly. - We have to do business. - I'm trying my best. I'm scared of her. She hits me hard whenever she sees me. It's difficult to get her sign the settlement. Cher, why don't you come with me tomorrow? I have to go to bed early. School tomorrow. All right. I'll go with you tomorrow. But I won't play driving again. Who knows what Mr. Yau will come up with. You must be kidding! We'll see. - Miss yau. - What? Isn't your head bent to one side? It has healed. You can't wear shoes yet? Can you find such big shoes for me? It's not easy to find. The supermarket isn't open yet. I'm here to see you. Where's you dad? You can just talk to me. It's about the insurance. You know, we have to pay all at once. But workers like us are constantly short of money. I know what you're trying to say. Look around, it's big here. The weather is nice. I can't make any decisions. Have you had your lunch? Miss yau, you have a good sense of humor. That's because you're funny. Hey! Did you do this on purpose? You've scared me. I'm more scared! I've moved them around for more than hundred times. You correct me every time. Where should I put them? I haven't decided yet. How do I know? Then hold these until you've figured it out. - I'm not moving them. - You have to, or I won't... - Mr. Yau. - Hold on. I can feel it when they're in the right position. Don't you understand? By the time you get the feeling, I won't have any feeling. I quit! May I say something, gentlemen? Fire away. - It was your fault. - What? You work here and you have to be responsible. The supermarket is going to open soon. If you quit now, their business will be affected. Who are you? I don't like your stance. Let's say I don't know him and my stance is fine. It's your problem. Mr. Yau, look over there. Under the leadership of miss yau, many young people are working hard with you. Don't be afraid. Boss, I'll be back tomorrow for our wages. Stay here. I'll deal with him. Remember this day. Once you leave, you leave hope behind. This supermarket will be open in four days. - Have you finished? - Yes. Bros, let's go. Let's go. Don't follow him. He's not a man. He's a devil. He's Satan. Trust me. I'm a devoted catholic. Stay here. We'll distribute biscuits. Let me go. You nuts. Have I made a good speech? Ask him. I'm sorry, Mr. Yau. I don't know he leads a team. You're awesome, young man. - This is for you. - You don't have to. There are plenty here. Get up. Mr. Yau... About the insurance... I know. You don't need to tell me. We'll fix the supermarket for you. He said he knows. We should. Thanks. - Hey. - What? The witch isn't around. You don't have to work so hard. I'm muddling through. I can't see why Mr. Yau would take over such a broken store? What do you know? Rich people like secondhand things. This sounds a bit like you. Cut it out! Are we still brothers? You shouldn't say things like this in public. - What's wrong? - Radar over there. Sea, stop dancing. Keep working. The party's over? I want to go on. - Young man, thanks for the oranges. - You're welcome. Take them back and eat them yourselves. - Make orange juice with them? - All right. bye-bye. - Oh, right. - What? - Come back early tomorrow. - Okay. - Bye-bye. - Goodnight. Bye-bye. Come. - I'm tired. - You bastard. Played smart and rubbed the floor! - Aren't you scared? - I'm exhausted. - Aren't you scared? - Scared of what? There's a dog behind us. Bastard, are you trying to scare me? You beat me? It hurts. How can we go home now? Let's get a massage. Which number? Number seven. She's good at it. Get up! You! Move the soft drinks over there. And you, move the oil there. Pick it up. "Rose, Rose, that's me..." I've place a matrimonial ad for so long and there's still no news. Men are so useless. Which paper have you placed your ad? This body shape is just right for me. Your mouth is slightly big. It's said that people with big mouths are impotent. Perfect! I've found the right man at last. - Terrific! - My piles! Look at you. Round mouth, round nose, round everywhere. My fortune teller said my future husband is round everywhere. Has anyone answered your matrimonial ad? Granny, do you read the newspaper too? Yes. You stink. Did you step on poo? No. It's my new perfume. Right, I've deposited the amount you wanted to borrow into your bank account. Granny, you're borrowing from her again? Because of this supermarket, we three have owed everyone a lot. You're wrong, may. Our relatives' money is our money. That's right. Cousin, just relax. I know you think I'm slutty. But I was born this way. I can't help it. How's your leg? - I've been busy... - I'm fine. Thanks. May... What are you staring at? Granny, is he a staff member? He's a volunteer. Tell him to deliver 10 bags of rice to my home. Okay. Sure. - And a dozen eggs. - Okay. Bye-bye. "Rose, Rose, I love you" bye-bye. Rose... - Bye-bye. - Women will ruin your life. Without women, you wouldn't have your daughter! Do you want to date my niece? Any suggestions? You can act like a male ostrich. Bury your head into the ground and cover it with soil. Waggle your ass to attract the female. If I Bury my head into the ground, I'll die before she falls in love with me. What nonsense! You can insult me but you can't insult the ostrich. - Get lost or I'll swear. - All right. Screw yourself. I've found a perfect man at last. Without the sacrifice of you three, I would never get my fourth happy marriage. I'm sorry. Thanks for your hard work. He's here! Help me check him out, okay? You're here. Where should I put them? I have a sad life. Mine is worse. I've climbed seven floors carrying these. Where should I put them? Poor you. Put them in the kitchen. Come on in. Please put the rice up there. Have you got a stool? Here. Stand on this and you'll be tall enough. Eighty one kilogram. Just right! What are you doing? You're sturdy. Good. Do you have any drinks? Yes. Please go out first. - Have a seat. - Okay. I'll make you a nice drink. The drink is ready. Please move over. This will make you feel stronger. - What's this? - Brandy with eggs. It'll do me good. But it's no use to my dead husbands. The one on the right is my first husband Richard. He was 53. I gave him more tonic food as he was old. He died because of overnutrition. This was my second husband. He was stronger and younger, but... let's not talk about him. I got smart the third time. I married a doctor. I thought he would take care of himself. But he couldn't cure his own illnesses. Anymore? Yes. Glad that you can take it. - They all died in my embrace. - Give it to me. They said they couldn't put up with me. They didn't go clubbing much. Are you married? It withered so quickly! It's working already? - No. I thought your ex-husbands were great. - Yes. I want to bow to them. You're passionate. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May peace be with you always. Men, please forgive me. I... Joe, you're so much fun. I have something more fun. I'll give you a riddle. What riddle? - Tell me. - Listen carefully. You put something hard into a small hole. Then you go through it by lurching forward. What is it? Naughty boy, you're making me horny. Hi, cousin. He's naughty. He's given me a riddle. - You put something hard... - Cut it out. Filthy. No. She's wrong. The answer isn't filthy. Make another guess. Bye-bye. Not filthy? Oh no, I'd better take a cold shower. May, there's so much money. Ask Joe to help you carry it. Granny, we haven't known him for long. We don't know him well. We'd better carry it ourselves. Give him the money. If anything goes wrong, ask him to repay us. He won't have that kind of money. Look at him, granny. He just can't stop moving his body. What time is it, comrade? - He's bumped into his friend. - Okay. Let's get the money first. Thanks. Why don't you count it? There are too many people. Let's get out first. Everyone seems like a thief when you're carrying so much money. What time is it, comrade? I don't work here. It's five to three. Thanks, comrade. Don't mention it. - Are we leaving? - Yes. Let's go. Why do you keep moving your body? Why does this bother you? Can't you give me a break? Comrade, it's two and a half to three. I'm leaving now. He scared me. Did you take out a lot of money? How do you know? I've got 3,000 dollars. You don't need to hold your bag like this if it's just 3,000 dollars. Where's the car park? Around the corner. Hurry up. - Hurry up. - I'm limping. How can I move fast? - Shall I carry the bag for you? - No. - Give it to me. - No. There's no time. I'll wait for you at the car park. I'll wait for you at the car park. - Give me back my bag! - Don't run. I'll kill you when I catch you. Don't move. Your gun has hurt my kidney! Smile! Smile! Comrade, smile! Smile! Joe. - We don't have time. Get in the car. - We're going to have tea. - Get in the car. - Get in. Hurry! A robbery! - Joe! - A robbery! Joe! Let me see. - Where's the money? - They've got it. Don't pretend, Joe. What do you mean? I know you're robbing us with your friends. I've robbed you? Can't you see I'm injured? I'm not arguing with you. It's sheer bad luck. I'll give you back 3,000 dollars. Three thousand dollars? Just 2,000 dollars? It's 200,000 dollars! One finger makes such a big difference? Why did you frame me? I was pushed down the car. You saw it. How could I be involved in the robbery? Now I have to go to the police station from time to time. I was speaking the truth. It was dangerous for you to carry the money. I was trying to help. The money was safe in my hands. It was taken in your hands. Young man, I wasn't born yesterday. You took the money. - Just admit it. - Oh my! I didn't take it. How can I admit? If I'd taken the money, I'd have admitted it. The robbers were pointing a gun at me. I nearly pissed in my pants. - Did you? - Yes. Your pants aren't even wet. It's just an expression, meaning the situation was critical. Two hundred thousand dollars isn't a small sum. Without the money to buy stock, your dad will play the harmonica again. Money lost can be found. That's easy for you to say. The money is very important to us. My life wasn't important when they were pointing a gun at me. Where are you going? I'm going to find the robbers to get my share. Alright? Sir, you can't borrow 200,000 dollars with your income. Miss, I'm in big trouble. Your ad said you'd support people in need unconditionally. I'm in need of money. Do you really believe in this? Yes. I'm childish. I believe in this. Miss, please help me. I really need the money. You're a taxi driver. Is the taxi yours? I have two partners. Take this form and discuss with your partners. What if they don't agree? Take your time. Thanks. - It's on me. - Cher, have some. Yummy! We're going to be rich. Did you win the lottery? There's a business. I've asked the Buddha and checked with fortune tellers. If you invest, you'll get rich. We're brothers. Last time I got the taxi, I counted you in, right? - Yes. - Yes, right? Do you want to be a boss? Yes! I want to buy pretty clothes, sea. Cher is smart. Look. Sign here and you'll have all the pretty clothes you want. Sign here? Why is it so small? - For easy carrying. - I'll sign. - Do you want to be rich? - Yes! Yes! Sign here then. For you. - Let's drink to it. Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! Joe, what business is this? Investing in the supermarket. What? That supermarket? No way. No. You signed it. That means you've agreed to sell the taxi. What? You're going to sell my taxi to help that woman? Are you insane? I got her into trouble twice. I should help her at least once. Do it yourself. I don't want to be involved. Do you think I want to do this? If you had paid the insurance on time, - I wouldn't have been in such trouble. - Are you blaming me now? - Your signature's here. - Give it to me. - No way! - Stop! Don't touch me. - Don't count me in. - Don't! - Don't fight. - This is fraud! - Give it back! - Go away! Don't run. Give me the paper. - Let go of me. - Don't be like that. You haven't checked the bill. I'm going to sell the taxi. Just try. I'll chop you into pieces if you sell it. - Just leave it. - Leave it? Who's going to pay for the meal? - You. - Me? - Get me the bill! - Okay, coming. Your admirer? He admires me. There are so many roses. I'm overwhelmed! To express my love to you. I'm so touched. I'm going to cry! Such a big heart. He's even giving me his heart. Who can he be? It must be him! Oh my! Abracadabra... I'm tired. I'm going to die. Help! This is hard on me. This is hard on me. "Who's real and who's the imposter" "it's really difficult to tell" "look at the hat on his head" "and the people around him" "there are dragons on his left and on his right" "there are dragons in front of him and behind him" "up and down, before and after" "left and right one, two, three, four" "five, six, seven, eight, nine nine dragons" dragons? Mr. Yau, what're you doing? I should be the one to ask this question. - I was playing with your daughter. - With your pants off? Do you want to take this off to play with me? - It hurts! - Play... Help, granny! What are you two doing? - Messing around in the supermarket. - Stop it. Why did you take his pants off? It wasn't me! What are you laughing at? Enjoy seeing his pants off? What are you doing? Put your pants on. Hurry up. "Rose, Rose, that's me" "Rose, Rose, that's me" Joe! She's so horny. The roses you sent me were beautiful. - I'm so loved! I even sprayed preservatives. - Lunatic. - I know how you feel for me. - Lunatic. Lunatic. Are you done yet? I'm sorry, granny. I was so obsessed with him that I didn't see you. Greet your uncle. Uncle! - Hi there. - Uncle, what are you doing? - What am I doing? - Yes. What is he doing? What are we doing? What are they doing? Granny... - Granny! - May! - May, go to the doctor's with Joe. - "I'm waiting to be picked up by you" - see a doctor. - Let's go. - Filthy! - Joe, the riddle you gave me last time, - I don't know the answer yet. - May, may! - Joe, Joe! - Scarlet, they're warming up to each other. I'm not just warmed up. I'm overheated! - Come with me. - Joe... Help me do a facial. Come. May! May! You have a filthy mind. How filthy? You put something hard into a small hole. Then you go through it by lurching forward. It's just crossing the harbor. Haven't you taken a ferry before? Stupid joke. Stay here, bastard! How can you have such a good mood? There are still lots of work to do. We'll make it. No worries. - Does your leg still hurt? - Not anymore. When will your leg recover? The doctor said it'd recovered. This is it. Do you have life goals, Joe? I just go wherever my life takes me. I haven't reached any goals yet. You should stop fooling around. Who would let their daughter marry a man like you? You have to change if you want to get married. Do you have a daughter to marry me? Do you like my granddaughter? She's a good girl. No kidding, granny. I brought up my granddaughter. I know what she thinks. If you're okay, she's okay. Bingo! Bingo? Then go for it! Sea, fancy a lemonade? Yes, please. I want one too. More lemon. - This one. - Try it out. You said you know how to fix it! Only you said I could. May, I love you. I love you. I love... Stop right there! Who is it? Joe! Okay. Over there! Stop there! - Stop! - Joe! Don't be afraid. Didn't you say may's here? You wouldn't have come if I hadn't said so. Who was there just now? What if he comes back? Forget it. We'll handle this tomorrow. Let's go. - What's up? Your piles hurt? - Yes. Adjust the position before sitting down. What have you done? - I thought you were just pretending. - Nonsense. Give it back to me. Have some congee. Comfortable? Hey. - I have something to tell you. - What's up? I'm going to be a star. What? You? You're not even five feet high. How can you be a star? I've already finished filming. They said I'm pretty and have a good figure. They also said I acted well. They all want me to be in their commercials. All right. - Show it to us. - Okay. What's my role? Anyone, just don't do anything that will embarrass us. No problem. - Hey. - What's up? Do you have time tonight? No. What's up? Nothing. What's up? You have piles. Just take a rest. The winner of miss Asia pageant 1986 is... Number 14, Nina li! I'm happy to be the winner of miss Asia pageant. I'll be the pride of Hong Kong. What do you think? - Do I look like her? - Like a whore. Like who? Like the singer Alan tam. I'm not talking to you. Come on. Who is it? I'm your devoted admirer. I don't deserve your admiration. You deserve it. We often see each other, but I don't have the courage to talk to you. All those words are like a big stone pressing on my heart. I've waited for this opportunity for so long. I can't stand it anymore. I can't stand it either. It's you, sea. Joe, are you doing a part-time job here? I'm catching the secret admirer, and that's you? No. I was just kidding. Just kidding? Joe, we've come to help. - Don't run away! - Don't let him run away. - Catch him! - Catch him! - Let's go! - Why are there so many people to catch me? - Stop! - This way. Cover your head! I can't. - Jump. - I can't. Joe! - You're doomed if they catch you. Just jump! - Stop! - Jump! - I can't! Someone has drowned! - Joe! - He's jumped. He's disappeared. - I can't see him. - Did he dive in? Where has he gone? - Nothing. - I'll go catch him. Don't jump. It's a sewage. It's stinky. The water is cold. Don't jump. He's coming up! - Look! He's sea! - Right! Why is sea here? - Have you seen the secret admirer? - What? Yes. He swam over there. I couldn't catch him. The water is cold. Go up first. When did sea come? He's been in the water for a few hours. I knew the pervert would jump into the water, so I've asked him to wait in the water. Come up first. Come up. Now that you've stopped looking, I'll go up first. Here. Why can't you date her in broad daylight? Look at the mess you're in. Poor you. I want to do this in broad daylight. But you show up whenever I want to talk to her. How can I? Okay. It was all my fault. If it hadn't been for me, you couldn't have escaped. Quiet! If someone finds out, I'll kill you. I'll chop you into pieces. I'll throttle you. You've kept your secret well. No one will find out. - Granny. - Drink this ginger soup. Any for you? Yes. Drink it. Have a sip. I can't. It's for the secret admirer only. - Put this on. Don't catch a cold. - Thanks. - What's this? - Tablets for cold. Medicine and sweater... Are you trying to scare me to death? So you're the secret admirer. You're secretive! I don't know what you're up to all this time. How secretive you are! Sea, have some more ginger soup. No, thanks! He's so bad-tempered. Don't just stand there. Make it look nice. Put away the boxes. Don't leave them in the middle of the road. They cost money. Be careful. Get to work right away. Here you come. This is the invitation for the cocktail party tomorrow. What are you up to? You open a new store here. Why did you sell the old one to us? How could I get a new one without selling the old one? Haven't you hurt us enough by selling that junk to us? We can have our own business. The most important thing is that it's a good business. How's your dad? Thanks for being so thoughtful! You're one hell of a relative! Aren't you trying to ruin their business? None of your business. I've got money. It wasn't my business. But I've sold my taxi and become a shareholder. - This is now my business. - Don't waste time talking to him. Back off! May! May, your leg hasn't recovered yet. This is heavy. Let me throw it. - Stay away. - You have to break it. Okay. - Use the ladder. - No. Go on! Sorry, I've broken the glasses. It doesn't matter. Don't worry about me. Take care of yourself. Thanks. Am I smart? Yes, you are. Thanks for your encouragement. Are they your friends? I'm a Buddhist. I don't have such friends. - Don't worry. I know a bit kung fu. - Okay. Go! See if you dare do this again, bastard! Are you all right? How can I be all right? Help me up. "Police magazine" thanks. - Recently, two criminals... - What's showing? - Police magazine. - Cheated innocent young girls. They set hidden cameras in changing rooms and filmed them getting changed. They're selling the footages as pornos. These are the photos of the criminals. If you have any information about them, please call 852-277... How can those girls be so silly? How can they ever show their faces after people have seen their bare buttocks? I'm one of them, sea. How can you say things like that? Cher! I'll kill you if anything happens to her. What's up? Cher! Cher! - I'm going to kill myself. - Cher! Let her go. - Don't jump if you see there's no glass. - Get up. It's embarrassing. What's up? No. Personal matters. We'll deal with you later. None of your business. - What's up? - Mac. - Please help distribute. - What's up? Please inform us as soon as you see these two people. What's up? - They ruin the lives of innocent girls. - Look out for them wherever you go. - Please help us. - Inform us when you see them. Thanks. Thanks. Where are you going? Yau tong shipyard. what's up, kwong? Calling 3377. We've found pigsy. Okay. Thanks, kwong. You sure it's him? Yes. He hasn't come out after such a long time. - Let's go in and have a look. - Let's go. Over there. They're inside. There are lots inside. Which one? He's short and fat with glasses. - Is that him? - Yes. Call the police. They're all pornos. Is Cher's among them? Call the police. It's serious. - Let's get it. - Is it okay? Yes. Pretend to be the big boss. Is chung here? Over there. Where's chung? He's making copies inside. - That's him. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Beat him. How? There are so many people. We beat him because there are so many people. Get some tools. Stay quiet or we'll kill you. You've ruined my sister's life. This is not my fault. The boss told me to film. Will you kill yourself for him? My sister's Cher. Where's her video? Tell us quickly. Over there. - This is sticking into my flesh. - Don't move. - No... - Don't move! I'll stick it right through if you move again. Stay put! Director, how come you've passed out? You should be familiar with all those scenes. You must have seen something terrific. - Don't follow closely. - Yes. - What should we do? - Big boss. Big boss is here. Big boss. Big boss. Oh no. He's coming. Hurry up. - Big boss. - Big boss. What are you two doing? - We're editing consultants. - Yes. Pornos like these don't need consultants. Do something else. - Yes. - Yes, big boss. Big boss. It's about time for the shipment. When you reach Thailand, just follow suit. They haven't figured this out yet. I'm talking to you! Big boss is talking to you! Big boss, he's fainted. Wake up! Wake up! Big brother. - What's up? - Over there. Stay there, you two. Members of gang shadow, show up! - Yes. - Yes. We left gang shadow to follow you. How can you set a trap for us like this? - Let's go, bro. - Let's go. For Cher's sake, swallow the negatives! Catch them! Stop! Don't run! I can't swallow it. Stuff it with your hands. I really can't. For our family's sake, you must swallow it. It's really hard to swallow it. You have to even if it's hard. For Cher's sake, just swallow it. Swallow it. I want to throw up. Bear with it. I'm half way through. Add oil. Okay. I've swallowed one third. Have you swallowed it, Joe? I've finished. Stay there. Stop! What's up? How are you? - I'm going to die. - What's up? Officer, call an ambulance for us. - What's up? - We've got negative poisoning. Negative poisoning? Pc3901 to headquarters. Two men have food poisoning and were being tracked down. Send an ambulance to cha kwo ling road. It really hurts this time. - How are you? - I'm in pain. You shouldn't have fought people stronger than you. No way. I have to give a lesson to those bastards. You haven't driven a taxi for a long time. You can't earn a living here. And now you're even beaten up. Why don't you go back to being a taxi driver? This supermarket is so big. How can you handle this alone? I'll manage. Buddha, you're so mean. I thought you've found me a good girl but why do you make me suffer? Where's the finishing line? Could you give me some hints? How far is it from me? Whatever. I'll just stuff it and forget all about it. Take it easy, young man. Are you talking to me? Talk to me! Did Buddha just talk to me? I'm the only one here. Who else can it be? Okay. I'm all ears. Just forget about her. Forget about her? I can't. I don't know what she thinks. Don't worry about what she thinks. What do you plan to do? I feel guilty about what's happened. Marry her if you feel bad. That's what I think. How do you know? I've gone through this too. Of course I know. Can you date up there? Yes. It's more open now. Don't just talk. Take action. Go for it! Yes, Buddha! What if I fail? Come here to whine again. If I succeed, I'll come back and be your godson. I'll go first. Buddha has given me clear instructions this time. I'll take action. I'll go for it. Joe leung, you're damaging public property. This is for you. For me? What's this? It's a cat's eye stone. It's pretty. It shines. Really? You don't believe me? Here, have a look inside my pocket. Hold your hand like this to see. Is it shiny? Yes! Joe leung, how dare you take advantage of me. I'm not. It's just natural. - You're low-class! - Okay. I'm sorry. Sit down first. I'll give you another gift. Don't take advantage of me again. I won't. This is for you. Take off your shoes. Take off my shoes? Yes. Both of them? Just your right foot. No peeking. Let me help you put this on. Come on. Stand up. What do you think? Is it comfy? Does it fit? I've spent a whole night making this. This is the greatest thing I've ever done. The guy who invented shoe pads is a genius. But I'm smarter than him. I'm a cripple. I know. Nobody is perfect. My left foot is three centimeters longer than my right foot. But mine is one inch apart. It doesn't matter. I'll help you. I'll accompany you. Let's play three-legged race. Are you ready? We're about to go. Ready. One, two... One, two... - Hurry up. - Move fast. - This way. - Hurry up. Hurry up. What are you looking at? You're so beautiful today. Yes. But you have buck teeth. - Do you have guts? - What's up? Do you have guts? What's in your mind? Come with me. Come. Keep an eye out for the cops. Can I try? - Aren't you scared? - No. Here. Take this. Closer. Be careful. Make sure you seal it well. Stay alert. Watch out for shoplifters. Okay. Help me. Hurry up. Be careful. These are expensive. Don't break them. Hi everyone! Nowadays, razors are not only for men. They're important for ladies too. Think about this. Your husband comes home for dinner. He sees that the pork in your soup is fatty and hairy. Will he crave to come home for dinner? Of course not. But a few strokes with this razor... Oh, it should be upside down. Sorry. A few strokes with this razor and all the hair is gone. Your husband will come home for dinner from now on. There's another use for this razor. You can use it to shave your legs. I don't have hairy legs - but I can show you. - You're right. It's sharp.

My fingernail broke. - Stay here! - What's up? - What's up? - What have you put in my store? - I haven't put anything here. - You did. I saw you. You took out something from your bag and put it in my store. - It's all right. - What was it then? - How do I know? - You're nuts. What did you say? You said I was nuts? - I'm sorry. - Don't let him go. - Don't let him go! He said I was nuts. - Just go on with your shopping. - Don't let him go! He said I was nuts! - Forget it. He can't say I'm nuts. - I saw him put something in the store. - He just put things in. - He shouldn't say I'm nuts even if I am. - He didn't take anything. Do you think I'm nuts? - No. No one's nuts. - Nuts. - He's nuts. - Carry on with your shopping. How many would you want, sir? We're on sale today. You said "try for free" here. Why do I have to buy? Nice! Take your time to try them out. The bananas are nice. Help me out. I'm bleeding from shaving cuts. Who told you to shave yourself? A snake! Snake! Run! Snake! Snake! - What's up? - What's up? - A snake! - Snake? - A snake! - Where? Don't be afraid. Get out first. - Help granny out first. - Okay. Don't just think about Scarlet. - Come catch the snake with me. - The snake bites. I have teeth to bite it too. Snake! Snake! Must be done by the bastard next door. - Who? - Nothing, granny. Do you want to date me? Yes. Can I? - Come with me. - Okay. So scary. - Joe, the snake is down there. - Where? There. How many are there? - Just one. - We'll surround it. It's not here. Is it on your side? No, where has it gone? It's biting my leg! I've got hold of its head. - Help me pull it away. - How? - Pull? - Pull it! - Be careful! - I'm so scared. Hit it with your spade. You have to hold it still first. - I'm trying. - How can I hit it? - It's gone. I can't hold it still. Hit it! - You have to hold it still. Oh no. Hit it! Hit it! Don't hit it. It's pissed. Don't be afraid. It's all right now. This snake is for making wine. - Shop here. - Come in. - We have 10 percent off. - Listen up!

Come get my customers if you're good. - You'd better watch out then. Let's go. - I'm not afraid of you! Bastard. That woman didn't even say thanks. What's up? Come shop here! "I'm a beautiful pineapple" -"take a close look at this big banana" -"look closely!" "Lots of sweet oranges and tangerines" "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" "everyone agrees that our fruit is fresh" "and much better than the other store" "our goods are nice and low-price" - "one dollar for two!" - "You don't have to pay" "just try it for free" "our pineapples are good for your health" "come buy from us" "they came to see and have just bought three" "everyone says they look nice and taste good" "then buy two more bunches of bananas" "and a few more tangerines" "business with meager profit can be rewarding" "everyone knows that our stocks are of great value" "you can find lots of good stuff here" "don't buy their rotten fruit" Joe, they're singing too. - He follows suit. - "Or you'll get food poisoning" "smart people will shop with us" "don't go to that filthy store for shopping" "you can find anything you want in my store" "they're cheating you with their songs" "don't let them rip you off" you're a real bully who speaks spiteful words. Your face really puts me off. Look at your ugly facial features, you're just a cheeky monkey that's trying to look cute. I don't look good but I'm capable. That's why I can wear a gold watch. You'll be punished for your filthy deals! I have three stores. All will be burnt down! - I have cash. - And it's getting less! - My son is good to me. - He won't have any offspring! - My wife is pretty. - She'll run away! You get a limp as your wife! I'm really angry with this! Her dad has nearly gone mad because of you. You cheated him to buy a broken store so that you get three. I'm really sorry for his family. There are tough days ahead of them. Officer, that's him. I recognize him. Arrest him. I recognize his clothes. What did you recognize? What are you saying? - Show me your ID card. - I recognize you. It's in the store. You don't have to say anything. You're accused of exposing your private parts. Come. Hurry up. - Boss, what should we do? - Look after the store. Great! Our supermarket is fine now. Shop with us. Come! Our supermarket is fine now. - Come shop with us. - Come. Scarlet just called. She said she got dumped. She got dumped? What? Dumped? Why did you choose her? What has she got that I haven't got? What drink would you like? - Distilled water, please. - Okay. I'm prettier than her. - What? - My body shape is better. Towel. Go get it yourself. She only likes you. She'll throw up when she sees me. I'll throw up when I see her. We're brothers. I won't take her from you. If you like her, go for it. Can I? Yes. Remember the first day she saw you in the supermarket? I could tell she liked you, but you didn't respond. Now that she's depressed, she'll easily accept you. Be her secret admirer one more time. Go for it. What should I say to her? Joe! You say "a big stone is pressing on your heart." - A big stone! - All right. - Scarlet, what's wrong with you? - He's the secret admirer. - I'm so sad. - I'm sentimental. Hold me tight. Will you marry another one? Be careful. Don't throw up yet. Hold on. Scarlet! Scarlet! Joe... No, I can't. What's this? This is my eyebrow. Your eyebrows are thick. - I don't like this. - They won't be thick. Bless me, deities. I've missed your past but I won't miss your future. We'll grow old together... And never be apart. I'm here for you, Scarlet. "Dear," "I wll spend my future with you." "I will take up the responsibility." Goodbye, my love. - Hey. - What? Has Joe proposed to you yet? Granny, what are you talking about? You've known each other for so long. I know what's between you. He doesn't like me. He likes you a lot. Women must forfeit a little as investment. He won't betray you. Granny, if someone likes you, what will you do? I'm so old now. Who will like me? Life is unpredictable. Look over there. I already know. He's sneaky. Do you want to say hi to him? No. What if he comes over to ask for my phone number? I don't know if I should give it to him. Let's go. Hurry up. Mr. Yau, Mr. Yau! Do I look different today? What's the difference? I'm wearing a tie. Why are you wearing one? Today is my big day. Your birthday? No. I want to shorten the distance between us. - Are we close enough? - Like a family. Never mention family again. The last time I trusted my family got me into big trouble. I hate that word. Go away! Mr. Yau... Mr. Yau... Mr. Yau... - Mr. Yau, we've known each other for long. - Really? You should know me well now? No, I don't. You're handsome, Mr. Yau. Don't you feel tired after exercising for so long? No. I've smoked for long and I'm still like this. Mr. Yau... I want to be a member of your family. Really? I've been waiting for this opportunity. Come with me. Deities, I, yau kwong nam... - What's your name? - Joe leung. And Joe leung swear to be blood brothers. I'll be his elder brother. Please be our witness. If we betray each other, we'll be condemned to death. - Mr. Yau, I didn't mean that. - But... I haven't been a big brother for long. Would you mind? We'll take the blood oath. Give me your index finger. Index finger again? Why is your dad biting Joe's finger? Are they playing gangsters? I'd rather you play the harmonica. It's not my fault this time. He wants to be part of the family. Part of the family? He wants to marry your daughter. That was what I meant, Mr. Yau. Mother of may! What's the matter, Mr. Yau? - Mother of may! May's going to get married. - Who are you praying to? Young man, thanks! You're welcome. You bit my finger and we're brothers. Get up. Joe! Hey, everyone. Joe, I was drunk last night. But I still remember what we did. What? What have you done with her? Why are you wearing a sieve? I'm getting married! - Congrats. - Congrats, Scarlet. Who are you going to marry? With Joe. I'm going to faint. Hold on. We spent last night together. Your words will ruin me. Joe, don't be shy. I've framed your love letter. Does it look nice? "I will take up the responsibility." Gross! Gross! May! May! - Joe! Joe! - What's the problem with them? - May! - It's complicated. "We took off our clothes and exercised together." - "I shaved myself." - May, listen to me. Don't go away. May! - Let me go! - What's up? - You're here. Tell her. - Let go! What did you and Scarlet do last night? I did it with her. You taught me to. You've heard him! It was him last night. Not me. You're filthy! You taught your brother to do such a filthy thing! He's the secret admirer. I'll deal with you later. - What? - I asked him to go for it. What's up? - What's up? - Ask her. - What's up? - Ask her. - What can I ask? - Ask what? Ask him why he could write such nice words. Look at him. I won't believe that he can be so romantic. Are the roses pretty? But you've got a mustache. Scarlet, the mustache isn't real. Look. What? May, the garden is really nice. - Let's go for a walk. - Okay. - Let's go. - Scarlet! Why did you faint when you saw me, Scarlet? Buddha, I haven't let you down. I've reached the finishing line. Thanks for finding her for me. I'm so happy. Today is my wedding day. I'll check if the roast pig has arrived. - Congrats! - Thanks. Come in and have a seat. - Dad, have the roast pigs arrive yet? - What? They're here. - Congrats! - Thanks. Come in and have a seat. Dad, here come the roast pigs. - Dad, the roast pigs are here. - Okay. Thanks, thanks. - Congrats! - Thanks! This way, please. Put them here. This is for you. Thanks. This way. May, you're beautiful. Let me have a look. How come it's you? That's me. Why do you have two more moles? I stuck them there on purpose. They make me look more sexy. Do you like them? Scarlet! - Serve the guests. - Yes, husband. You're impressive. I'm your elder brother. Have some respect. She's my wife. Behave yourselves in public. Thanks for your help, temple keeper. No problem. Mrs. Sun, I've been here for over 20 years. I've never seen such a great party. Remember to tell me when the auspicious hour comes. Don't worry. Leave it to me. Mom, red packets. Just these? Do you have any in your pockets? Those two are mine. My name is written on them. Don't be silly. Give them to me. Okay. Are you happy, may? Yes. And you? Of course. I don't have to cook from now on. You! Dr. Ruth said girls will be nervous the first time. Are you nervous? A little bit. But I think after tonight, I won't be nervous anymore. Nervous of what? Nothing. May said she couldn't get the headdress right. - Why don't you help her? - Okay. - I'll go out first. - See you. My wife, let me help you put this on. You're so beautiful today. Just today? No. You're beautiful all the time. Do I look good? You're handsome. Lots of guests said so. I want to tell you something. I know. Not that. I want to tell you... Tell me what? I'm a virgin. Don't laugh at me. Let's be easy on each other tonight. I will. I'm not perfect. - I know. - Actually, I was born a limp. That day on the peak, you told me that you wouldn't mind. I have been so happy. Hey, hey. Don't tell me you regret it now. - Of course not. It's just... - The auspicious hour has come! It's time for the ceremony. I'm nervous, I'll go out first. Before I get drunk, let's make it clear. Be gentle to my daughter tonight. - Okay? - Okay. We've sorted this out. - Joe leung, Joe leung... - Get ready for the ceremony! Okay. Coming! First bow to the earth. Second bow to Buddha. She's my godfather? Third bow to the parents. Bow to each other. Husband, from now on, I only belong to you. Why don't you kiss me yet? All right.
