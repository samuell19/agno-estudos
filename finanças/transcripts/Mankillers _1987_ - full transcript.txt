[music playing] Mankillers Boys, boys, easy with the hardware. Johnny's my friend. Johnny, Johnny, it's good to see you. How's everything? Cut the bullshit, Minetti. You got the stuff? Of course, I've got the stuff. That's part of the deal, right? I trust you got my merchandise, yes? First I see the stuff. Now. OK, Johnny, OK, you can see. But you won't touch till I see my merchandise, hm? It's all there, Johnny, 10 pounds, 96% pure. It's first class stuff, the best Columbia has to offer. Don't you ever touch me again. I told you it was the best. Now I hope what you brought me is the best. Beautiful, we'll take them all. Just go over there and get me the briefcase, and they're all yours. Hey, boss, these guys are feds. I know. Hey, Hey, runaway. Don't worry, she's mine. Let her run. Any news? No, not a word. Senator Langley's been on my case all morning. He wants to hold a damn press conference and make an announcement that the operation is a success. What an asshole. Mr. Wheeler's office. Just a moment. It's Columbia. Mr. Williams. What the hell's going on down there? What? Damn. Bastard got us again. He killed four more agents and another girl. Oh, Frank. They were the best we had. Wrong, Mickland was the best we had, before he went over to the other side. And that's why we can't stop him, because he was one of us. Damn it. He knows the agency too well. He knows how we operate, and he knows how we think. How do we counter that? With someone who knows him better than he knows himself. Someone who's just has crazy as he is. Oh, no. No, Frank, you don't mean-- McKenna. Oh, Frank, you're asking for trouble. I know, but maybe trouble is just what we need. Where is she? Nice place you have here. Shut the fuck up, got the stuff? It's right there in the bag. First, I see the money. Let me the smack. What the hell is this? Freeze you fuck. Drop it. Anybody else? What the hell kind of cop are you? Shut up. The money. Get the money! Go on! Drop it! Pleasure doing business with you. You're ripping us off. You're not going to make it, cop. Come on! Get in the car! Faster, faster. You don't have to do that now. It's over. Let's get the hell out of here. Drop the gun. Drop the gun. You used me. I let you talk me in to this, and you used me. You bastard. You're breaking my heart, baby. I love you. Dumb bitch. [music playing] That's funny, she was here just a second ago. Where the hell did she go? Who cares? It's a waste of time anyway, if you ask me. Shit. - What the hell. Do it, and your dead meat. Take it easy, McKenna, we're friends. I'll decide that. Who sent you? The agency. I'm not interested. Williams wants to see you. I said I'm not interested. Take your partner. And go tell William, the next time he sends somebody out there, they're going to come back in a bag. It's important, McKenna. You're not listening, Mr. Jesus Christ, Joe, listen to her, will ya? - Good advice, take it. - It's about Mickland. Why me? You kicked me out of the agency once, remember? You're the best one for the job. You must really be desperate if you're willing to trust me again. Trust has little to do with it. The last time you saw Mickland, you were laying in the middle of the road with a bullet in your chest. I figure you want a crack at him more than anyone else alive. What do I get out of it? Name your price. I'm not one of your hired killers. What then? A chance to rejoin the agency at my former rank with a clean record. That can be arranged. You pull this one off, I might even throw in a promotion. That's not all, Williams. I hand pick my own team. I get to call the shots. No interference. You know we don't operate that way, McKenna. You will this time. Take it or leave it. OK, I'll go along this time, McKenna, but only this time. I'm going to need a team of 10-- no make that 12-- of the best I can get. No problem there. I'll have Joan work up a list of our available men. No, I want women. It's got to be women. How the hell are you going to pull this mission off with women. Don't give me that. Women are more effective in the field. You told me that once yourself. Sometimes, you really try my patience, McKenna. May I remind you that we're not discussing normal operations. We're discussing John Mickland. Exactly, and if I know Mickland, and I do, the last thing in the world he'd expect is women. You got a point there. I'll grant you that. We don't have 12 women trained for this type of mission. We never have. If I supply them, will you agree? Well? All right, where you going to find these kind of women? Oh, I'll find them. But you have to get them out. Get them out, get them out of where? [music playing] All right, ladies, slide down. Form a line facing us. All right ladies, you heard her, move it. Taylor XM, first degree murder, serving two consecutive life sentences. Hey, what the hell's going here anyway? Keep your mouth shut. Rollins, Christine, transportation and the sale of illegal weapons. Two assassination attempts on third world leaders, 40 years to life. Dusty Arosa, assault and battery, possession of narcotics, 25 years. Daniels, Trish, Extortion, arson, manslaughter, life sentence. Davis, Terry, breaking and entering, grand theft, bank robbery, original sentence 15 to 20 years, extended to 30 years after three escape attempts. Skinner, Margaret, extortion, murder, life sentence. Rosetti, Maria, assault with a deadly weapon, first degree murder, killed one of the guards here four months ago, stabbed him in the ear with a knitting needle. Sentenced to death. Why'd you do it? I already have a sweater. All right, clam up, clam up. Smith, Shannon, manslaughter, 25 to 30 years. How old are you? 19. Thompson, Vicki, possession and sale of narcotics, transportation of illegal substances, serving 20 years. Leonardo, Lisa, prostitution, assaulting an officer, extortion, conspiracy to commit homicide. Thank you, Guard. You may leave. All right, ladies. I use that term loosely. Here's the story, I need 10 volunteers. That's you. Cooperate with me and I can get out of here in two hours. Lose the gum. Lose it. Kiss my ass. [snickering] Whoa. Come here. Come here. Let me talk to you. GROUP: Ooohhh! (WHISPERING) You straighten up, or I'm going to kick the shit out of you. Get back in line. Any the other smart ass want a piece of that action? My name is Racheal McKenna. What we're talking about is taking part in a covert operation. You'll learn more about it when I think you ready to learn it. For now, all you need to know is if you live through this, if any of you do, you have a damn good chance of getting a full pardon. You'll train day and night. And I can promise you, I'll get your butts in shape. Each and every one of you will obey my orders. And don't forget, there's a cell or an electric chair waiting for you right here. You cross the line one time, you try something stupid, like an escape, and you get shipped right back here. That is if I don't put a bullet in the back of your head first. Anybody want out? Now's the time. Door's open. Your cells are waiting for you. Come on, line it up. Keep it moving. Come on. Take a good look girls. This is home for the next four weeks. Better get used to it. [music playing] Hey, Jake, what you got good today? See for yourself. Check out these honeys. Uh-huh, they are sweet. Hey, when you going to give me one of these? Just as soon as you can pay the price. Right. Come on, give me a hand. [screams] Come on. You better go easy with that shit, Mickland. Mind your own fucking business. All right, man, all right. What the hell is this, Jake? On such short notice, the best I could do. The best you could do. I need 10 girls by the end of the week. Hey, you want more girls, the price is double. Don't fuck with me, Jake. I finally found a group that's ready to make a big deal, the one who's going to get me out of this slime hole, and you're going to stick it to me. You don't understand, my friend. Girls are expensive, you want more, the price is double. Don't ever do this again, Jake. Now, get out of here. Thanks. [crying] Bruno. Yeah, boss. Take these two out, clean them up. Come on, girls, Party time. Hey, Jake, stick around for the fun. Not this time. I got work to do. Suit yourself. [music playing] Shh, be good. And you can stay here with me. Pig. Fall in. Fall in. Fall in. Get those asses out here now. Hurry up, you assholes, get in line. You've been in prison for too long. You're lazy and you're soft. First order of business is to get you in shape. Sergeant, start the day with a forced march, 5 miles. 5 miles? Are you crazy? Sergeant, make that 10 miles. That sucks. 15 miles. Compliments of prisoner Rosetti. [music playing] It's hopeless. Give them time, Sergeant. Give them time. Never been so tired in my life. This mission should be a piece of cake. Girl, I heard that. Just what the hell do you think you're doing? I'm getting out of here. Are you coming? I don't think you understand. What? You ain't going nowhere. The hell I ain't. What happened here? She just slipped on a bar of soap. Better watch it, Rosetti, looks pretty unhealthy to me. Take her back to the bunkhouse. Get her cleaned up. Go on. You saved my life, why? Because that's what being a team is all about. Try to remember that, huh? Oh, Frank, have you heard from McKenna yet? No, you know how she is. If I want to know anything, I'll have to go out there myself. If I were you, Frank, I'd terminate the entire operation, before it blows up in your face. Well, Joan, it's gone this far, I might just as well see it through to it's completion. It's your neck Frank. That it is. But it's not stuck out there quite as it as it seems. Meaning? Meaning, I've got an ace up my sleeve. I've given her an inch. I finally got a man on the inside of Mickland's operation. You sound confident, but it might not be enough. Well, it'll have to do. It's all the help I can give her. Hey. Bring him inside. Who sent you? Who sent you? Tell me who sent you, or I'll hack your fucking leg off. Don't. William sent me. William. Why, who you studying for? McKenna, McKenna, an agent named McKenna. You're a liar. I killed McKenna years ago. It's the truth you bastard. It's the truth. [music playing] Take over, Sergeant. All right, Rosetti. You're up first. Front and center. That was very nice, McKenna. I see you still got what it takes. We have to talk. We had a deal, Williams. No interference. I've got to move up your timetable. Why? Because I had a man on the inside, but there's been no contact with him for over a week now. I assumed that he was discovered and killed by Mickland. You stupid bastard. Hey, I was trying to give you an edge. This operation was supposed to be on the element of surprise. How much did he know? Very little. But enough to put Mickland on the defensive if he talked. You can bet he did. Christ, why didn't you just send a telegram and tell him I was coming? What's done is done. Now, you've got to move out of here before we lose him. How soon can you be ready? I need at least another three weeks with the girls. I can knock it down to two if I have to. You've got to move out sooner. You've got to move out in 12 hours. But that's not possible. We're not ready. Make it possible. 12 hours. OK, ladies. Fall in. At ease. I just got the word, we're moving out tomorrow morning. You ladies have done one hell of a job here. You really have. For what it's worth, I'm proud of you all. You've become a team, a damned good one. I hope you all come back. [music playing] Freeze right there. You put your guns down real slow, just like nice little girls. Move it, right now. Lets' get the hell out of here. Two down, 10 to go. Mickland, Mickland. What the hell happened to you? They're coming, man. I swear to God, they're all coming. What? The women, they're all women. Where the hell's the rest of the patrol? They're all dead. What you talking about, dead, for Christ sake. You're going to stand there and tell me that a bunch of women killed my men? Yeah. And you ran away from women? Get Bruno, and the of the men. We're going out after them. You coming, Jake? Hey, you know I love a party. [music playing] Jesus Christ, boss. What the hell is this? Well they sure did a job on your boys, Johnny. - Come on. - No, come back. Damn idiot. Say hello to Bruno, girl. Leonardo, circle around and get in position. In exactly 10 seconds, I'll take out the man on the left. You got the other one. Use your knife. Move an inch and you're dead. Well if ain't Rachael McKenna. After all these years, I thought you were dead. I bet you did. This time, you're going to die. No, you are. What the hell? Get up. Let's go. [music playing] Fucking slut. Now you listen to me. I want you to say that you want me to fuck you. You got it. No. Say it, say it, please fuck me, Jake. - Please fuck me, Jake. - What? I can't hear you! Please fuck me, Jake! You cunt. I wouldn't dirty myself on you. Sorry, baby, you just don't make the grade. Come on. Hey, make yourselves comfortable. If any of you douchebags need anything, just ask for Uncle Bruno. Why take prisoners? Why don't you just kill them and get it over with? Because I'm not stupid. That's not stupid, that's smart. They're soldier, Jake, nothing more. They've been sent here on a mission to kill us. But they lost. Killing them won't change a thing. There's plenty more where they came from. Plus, we have to find out what the agency knows about our operation, then kill them. You're not going to make them talk. Oh, I've got ways Jake. I've got ways. It's good to see you again, Rachael. No, I mean it. Is just good to see you. Don't con me, John. No con. It's just good to see you. There was a time when it was different between you and I. It could be that way again. And more money than you ever dreamed of. Hey, this is Johnny, remember. Fuck you. How much do you know? How much do you know? Your life is over. So what the hell are we going to do now? - Yeah, what about it. - I don't know. I'm thinking, I'm thinking. And I'm thinking too. If McKenna's dead, then we're out here all alone. We don't know if she's dead. Then where the hell is she. They should have been here by now. If she ain't dead, she's been captured How do you figure? What is this then? Dead or alive, she ain't no damn good to us now. Yeah, well, I think we should all just turn our little butts around and get the hell out of here, every girl for herself. Yeah. I heard that. You got my vote. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What the hell you guys talking about? If McKenna's been captured, she's in trouble, and she needs our help. Who cares? Nobody is going to help us. Yeah, she knew what she was getting into. I don't believe what I'm hearing. Well, you just better believe it, baby. Just because she saved your ass once, doesn't mean the rest of us got to die trying to save hers. Because she never done shit for us. She can do anything for you, huh. She didn't do anything but take you out of that stinking hell hole called a prison. How many years you have left, Thompson? 45. And you Rollins, 30, 40 years. And what about you Daniels, life, wasn't it. Rachael McKenna took us out of that place and don't you forget it. Sure, so we could come out here and die. What the hell's the difference. She gave us the chance when nobody else in this world would. A chance to be the best at what we do, and use it for something that really matters. A chance to respect ourselves. That's the difference. Now that woman is out there someplace, and she needs our help. And by God, we're going to give her, all of us. And anybody who thinks differently is going to answer to me, right here, right now. That goes for me too. I'm in. OK, where do we start? [music playing] This is just for you. You're dead. All right girls, let's move it. Stay here, we're going back in. All set up. Still got three more to go. You've got two minutes to get done and in position, that's when I make my move. Got it. Here, I'll take care of him. You move on. You're going to love this, baby. And you're going to love this. You fucking bitch. Stay here and cover me. Right. Can you make it? Yeah, I can make it. Everything's set, let's go. Let's go my ass. You ain't going nowhere. Say goodbye, ladies. Run, hurry. [music playing] You're going to be OK. Give me the [inaudible]. I'm going back in to finish this. The rest of you stay put. I'm going with you. No, you're not. Just try and stop me. This is my battle. I've got to fight this alone. Maybe next time. Yeah. [music playing] Mickland! It's all over Mickland. Drop it, Mickland. You can't kill me. You know you can't kill me! [music playing] Bitch. Your life is over, Mickland. Come on girls, let's go home. [music playing] [music playing]
