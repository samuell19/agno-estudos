Come on, Gökhan! Move on. Wait, honey! I've got the... Are you sure you've been... You came and rented a place here! Excuse me! We are close. It's somewhere... I am not going a step further. What happened? Are you trying to make me sick? Who in their right mind would rent a place. Why not? What is wrong with it? You really are trying to drive me crazy, Look at the shithole you bring me to! If we got massacred here, no one. You are exaggerating honey. Just take a look around you. Hey! What's with all the goddamn noise? Dump that bitch and come upstairs, hubby! This is also totally normal. Buket! Buket come back here, please? Hey! Who do you think I'm talking to? Fuckers! Go and play. Buket, you could at least have a looked. Besides, it's not such. Couldn't we just make. Buket... I have seen as much as I need to, Gökhan. # He is lying! I did not escaped # But yesterday we had a phone contact # My husband is not looking after us. Don't smoke that shit at. What's going on? Why would I be fighting? There was this nasty woman just like our I sent them both packing. You know what you can do with. When you were still hiding lipsticks, I was out there getting fucked. Here. Have a drag and chill out. Turn the damn thing off! So... Let's hear it then! Well, there's not a whole lot to tell. You mean Buket walked out, She didn't even look at the place. The girl has a point though. You can find whatever. Thieves, crooks, druggies, You make it sound like, we'd be. We'd shut the front door on all that. True! It's not a problem for you. Don't give me a hard time. Why don't you try to understand? Look girl! The guy from this morning. What a damn cutie! He's just my type! Well, he is not mine! # "Welcome home Buket" # # - I already sang! # - Gökhan. # - OK! I will sign... Are you ready? # ...turn out the light and sleep # I maybe gone from here, Oh my God! He's here! My hubby's here... Come, come. She's some lucky woman! You call that luck? I'd rather go without than have a man. Right sure... Hey, what's going on there, girl? Gökhan! How are things? Good and you? Same as ever. Come in! Take a seat. How is writing works? Not bad... I lost some of my notes. I wanted to have a lock for them. I don't think they are here. If they. I will check Buket': room. Let's sit and drink a coffee. OK, you prepare the coffee. I will look. # - I already sang! # - Gökhan! # I still feel your warmth # if I could only nuzzle up to you, What? Sweetie, Serap's mum is here. All right then see you tomorrow. Sorry... Where is he? Serap why are you taking him? What are you doing here Gökhan? I'm looking for my notes... It's best if you two talk. I was going. So have you found your notes? No. Fine, than they are not here. So that means you can also go now. Buket! Is it just all about the house? Anyway, I'm knackered. What are you doing with that pillow? We bought it together, do you remember? Fine, Gökhan! Then take ls there someone else with you? None of you business! It's all over I don't want you in my life anymore. How can you say that so casually, So what's happened to make it finish? Is there someone else? You've found out everything now. Will you piss off out my life now? Go away... Girls! My hubby's got his pillow. Come on hubby! Come on, my man! Don't laugh, bitches! You've got my... I guess your hubby's a bit of a womanizer. He gave Sanem the eye on his way past, So when are you going to spill the beans? Don't play dumb with me, girl! It hasn't escaped me. Let's hear it. Well... There's nothing to tell, mama... I swear, there's really. Look at me girl! Don't afraid that I am. My lips are sealed. Once I sealed them, Now go on spill the beans. Hayat told me I wasn't allowed. Oh God! Don't listen to her, girl! If it's going to happen, it will. Come my darling... It could really happen? Sure... If you want it to... What the hell are you doing here? She'll be right down! Let the girl catch her breath at least! It was bang-bang-bang morning and night. It hasn't taken you long too. I haven't forgotten them, mama. That's why. Don't give me that! It's fine for you. ...when you get mature and ...nip and tucks here, there and. Go down right now girls! # Is there someone else # # Yes, there is! There is some else. # One more? Yes, I want to have. Thank you. Excuse me! Just a second! # Son, where have you disappeared to? Mum! My Mum! My mum! What! Why are you shouting? # And talk us through what happened. # We heard from him at the begin... # # ...but for the last three years # Did he just run away and that was the. What's going on? Which one's your mum? # What kind of problems did he # They used to fight. They just couldn't. # Well, that's why my son pushed off. # # But if he only knew how upset his father # He's been eating his heart out wishing # He had a stroke and had to spend days in. # He wondered his son was with us. # # All right. Then let's make another appeal. I have to close the phone now mum, I rented mum. I rented. I haven't been doing anything, mum. I'm fine mum, fine... Have you seen something hanging out? Fuck off! Little brat! Are you going to call your mum? I can't! How can I? If I turned up looking like this, How do you know? Didn't you see. They must miss you so badly... They don't miss me. Come on, get up. Tidy yourself up. Hayat will start bitching soon. If-Gökhan. If-OK! I will sign... Are you ready? # turn out the light and sleep with me # I maybe gone from here, # your weeping voice echoes in my ears # # I still feel your warmth # if I could only nuzzle up to you, Sanem! # Like clouds before the rain # What's that you're hiding. Nothing... How are you feeling, sister? Stop trying to change the subject. Let's see. Come on! What's this now? Well, you use it to record sounds and. Do you lake me for an idiot, girl? What I'm asking is what. Nothing? Don't tell me the boy's I don't know. No. I doubt it. He's not. Hey, girl! You didn't nick it. No! Why would I do that, sister? A star's fallen out... Come on make a wish. Anyway, you make a wish when you see. The world's on its ass. Come on. Time to go down. OK. I'll be right there. Don't let Hayat see that thing... Sanem. Hello... Remember the other morning we met. Round them all up! Let me go! Set my arm free bastard. Hayat! What shall we do with this one, chief? Fuck off! Don't let me see you. What the hell is that? You have beaten the shit out of him! Fuck you! How many is that now? Slick him in the undercover car. Fuck off, asshole! Or I'll arrest you! Get out of the car! Fuck off! Well, that's the way things are, I understand... or at least, But this life you live, is not real life. My name is 'Hayat' (means life), aunt. That's enough for me. I will take my son back to... What's she going to do there? You think... I wouldn't tell anyone. If anyone happened to ask, I'd say. He'd get unemployment benefit, Al least I'd see my. Thanks for everything, mama! We're always here for you, don't worry. You'd be well enough to go. Hey, some lucky bitch you are! You landed on all fours again, Let's two of us wait outside for a bit. Besides, someone wants to see you. Your mum's here! You were out of it when she turned up... We've talked a bit. There's nothing to worry about. We explained things as best we could. Don't upset yourself. It doesn't matter where you are, Come on, girl, you'll only make me cry. You're always welcome here. Take this also... I am coming mum. I am waiting. Take care of yourself. # My eyes are swollen with tears # # the last passenger journey # Are you recording again??? Let's sing us a song and. We can not have fun like that! Just spin around a bit and. Sure, baby. We're used to. Come on, girl! You gel up too! No, just give me a break! Get up girl! Get up! You sneaky little whore! Fuck you! Whose guy do you think you're jerking. Don't hit me, mama please... I didn't do anything. Who the fuck are you? Who do you think. Who do you think you are? He's mine! He's mine! It's all over. It's finished. He's mine, mine, mine. Fuck off! Get the hell out of this house! Fuck off! Fuck off! Get out of this house! Fuck off! You have stolen my Hayat, Fuck off! Fuck off! You've wrecked us! Fuck off. Fuck off! Come here. Come on. Living with that woman is painful! We grew up together. It was. Of course everyone knew. One day, my dad grabbed me. He'd beat and beat me... He told me that if you want to get out of. They found an innocent girl who didn't. The bitch, Hayat wasn't seen. I married. Then on top of all that, Anyway, she turns up one day... I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw her. There was a white dress on her... Her hair was blowing with the wind.. You would think she was an angel... She said I came here to take you with me. She said we will be happy together. I was out of my mind. I talked to my self; 'Are you happy?' 'Did you chose this life by your own?' What about this woman... this child?' 'What are you waiting for. Unchain your self this is your. After that... After that well we are here. Well, that's enough of me. What's going I'm not stupid, you know. I don't know... Nothing. Seeing there's nothing to tell, Off you go downstairs. Get up girl! What about Hayat, mama? I gave her some pills. And by tomorrow she'll have forgotten. Is it done yet, sister Nane! Yes! It's done. Have you. They are wailing for you inside! It'll hurt like hell, mama! It won't hurt. It won't! Hold on girl! Hold on! Stop! Wait! I haven't even pulled it off yet! Have no pity, Nane! Keep still! You'd be in trouble if. I am talking to you! Yes, you! Don't waste your time standing there. I cam get it. Is she sick or something? Pardon me? Poor darling, you don't know. She's got a customer, that's what I mean. I see... Very good to you! For God's sake! If you insist on waiting, Don't hang around here like my pimp! Come on. Do I have to wail. We'll go out first time for along time. I will bring it mama... Woman habits! What can you do, mama? Wacko! Who'd look at you when. What you really mean is, Shut up! What do you think. Sure I am a princess! Hayat's not home right now. I know. Thank you honey. What are you doing, wacko? Just hang on! That piece of paper with. Look thoroughly. I am... It's not here! Then call and ask... No answer? No. Where on earth has she got to? Well, don't expect me to get up now and. You should have memorized the number. Like you gave me the chance! Go on then. Go get it. I have my eyes on the waiter anyway. You know 'what? Now go on, get moving! Don't think I'm done with you yet. I'm the greatest fucker in the universe! I'm not only good at fucking, but also.

Nobody has seen, let's just get rid of it. I swear ifs true that two. One of them is me and the other is you“. Do you always drink so much. No. No, I don't. That day was a one-off..

Enough! Gökhan's not here! You'd better. Oh yeah?! Who... 7 Forget who you are. What's a freak like you. It's none of your damn business who I am! Hello... I want to give you some. So you remembered! Anyone come by while I was out? She did. You didn't answer the door, did you? Of course I did. Why shouldn't I? Who do you think I am? Why did you get these? To cut your hair. Now Buket knows you're here, we can'! We need to get away for a while. So why didn't you get a wig? I want you to wear these. No! We need to do this. I said no! I'm not wearing these and. You have to! I don't have to do anything! This is the way I am! I am what you see! I know! I've read it! Listen. I don't want you to be anything else. I'm just asking you to change how you. You can't try to change me like some I'm not trying to change you... Then what are you trying to do? What if you don't fancy me? Promise you'll fancy me still. Will you fancy me? I promise. OK... Come on... There are somethings I need... Wait. I'll be right back. You can sit over there. Gökhan! Welcome! What's up? You don't usually drop by. Sit down. What do you want to drink? Tea, coffee? I'm in a bit of a hurry... You, in a hurry? Çağlar, can I stay at your place. Of course you can. Why are you even. It's kind of a tricky situation. Any chance I can have the keys now? Sure... The backup key is... somewhere... here. Take it then... Thanks. See you! Keep the place clean! Did you put us at risk just for these? Yes, just for these. We almost got caught! But we didn't, did we? Give that them to me. Slop messing with my bag and. To a friend of mine's place. Is it safe? There won't be any problem if you... If I what? If you're a bit careful the way you act... How do you want me to act? You want me to act like a guy, don't you? Well, I mean. I should be leaving you right here, So all this bullshit was because I'm not ashamed of anyone. I just... Cut your hair, wear these rags. What will you want from me next? Enough! Shut up! What's wrong? It's not to your liking? Don't talk anymore. Hello! Hello! Where's Gökhan? In the bathroom. I'm Çağlar. You? Yes, you... Çağlar! I was just about to get an introduction. How about we have a word? Sure buddy let's talk. What the hell's going on here? I haven't had a chance to explain, Explain? What are you going to explain? OK, wait. Don't say anything. Is he a fag? Look, are you out of your mind? What the fuck do you think you're doing. It's only for a short time... Look, Gökhan. Open your ears and I don't want some weirdo fag in my house. If you're going to stay, fine. But get. Tum down the volume a bit, will you? What do I care? Suppose the guy cuts our throats or walks. Stop calling her "him", Çağlar! Gökhan, just don't tell me. I can't believe you! Hey Hey! Don't touch that! I don't sleep with her... We just need a bit of help from you. Besides, just look at him! He's probably. He's sure to have AIDS. Where did you suddenly. Buddy, I told you not to touch! I don't want you touching anything! Stop! Don't even sit down! It's best if we go now. Yes, I couldn't agree more. What are we going to do now? I am thinking on that... I've created all kinds of problems. You've had to move out because of me. And now you've had a. We'll talk about these later... The guy there, keeps staring at us. Let's go. Good evening! Good evening! I think we've met, haven't we? No, I don't think so... We were just leaving actually. Well, good night then. So who was it? I honestly can't remember. I just don't get what Süleyman was doing. Bro, he was totally hammered. They accosted him on he street. And he took them for regular women. He was completely out of it. Otherwise, what would a straight guy be. Who was that guy? Just a guy... Was he a special customer of yours? Is this the plan you dreamed up? Tell me if you have a better idea. If you'd done as I said, What didn't I do? If you'd acted like a guy at Çağlar's I can't act like a guy! Watch what you say! I gave up my family, my education, Do you expect me to deny what I am now. Is it so hard alter everything. Besides, aren't you a man. Hey, who's there? You just don't understand me. # Tum out the light and sleep with me # I may be gone from here, tomorrow. # Your weeping voice echoes in my ears, # # I still feel your warmth # if I could only nuzzle up to you # My eyes are swollen with tears # The last passenger, # The last passenger was you... #
