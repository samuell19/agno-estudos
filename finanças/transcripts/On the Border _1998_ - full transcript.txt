Two years now? Close enough. You know, Jake, I believe there's something you can do for me, alittle something on the side. Of course, you'll be wellcompensated for your efforts. There's really no delicateway of putting this. So I'm just going to lay it on the table. I believe someone is fucking my wife, and I'd like to know who it is. Of course sooner or later,I'm going to catch them at it. Then I'm going to have to kill them. I can't help but think, if therewas just some way I could find out who it was first, I could handle it in a more civilized way. You know what I mean? And what I need to know here,Jake, is are we negotiating or am I spanking my own monkey? [moaning and breathing heavily] [kissing] That was way better thanspanking my own monkey. Oh, you. [kissing] What'd you say to him toget him out of his tree? I said I need Jake Barnes ata little motel across the border and fuck his brains out. [laughs] Honesty is always the best policy. You know, he'd kill you if he found out. And then he'd kill you. Ed would never touch me. You know, my dear husbandonly gets this jumpy when there's a drop coming. It's been three months. Here, tie me up. Again? You know what I mean. You know, if it is a drop,Jake, no more next time. This time we do it. Let's not get into that again, all right? Let's just make sure Eddoesn't find out about us. And that's enough for you? It has been till now. Oh yeah. [music playing] [car drives by] [footsteps] [opens door] Welcome back.

So you're not going to call the authorities? It's not my job to decide who's good enough to be an American. Is that safe? Safe's picking up hitch hikers. OK, you are [non-english speech]..

[mechanical sounds] Jake, could you step inmy office a minute, please? So what's up? What do you mean? She went out again last night. She went to the movies in Juarez. Why would she cross the border? Don't know. Maybe she likes Spanish movies better. Then what? She went straight home. I was behind her the whole way. Hm. Yeah, pretty simple. I don't want simple. That's how it is. That's because you're seeing it as simple, and simple is stupid. And stupid is not somethingthat you want to be, is it? Nope. Good. Our friend with the itchy John,Tom, is history come Saturday. Got it? Yeah. There are no simple answers,Jake, no simple answers. [music playing] [click] [MUSIC - ABRA MOORE, "HAPPINESS"] [SINGING] I didn't know it could be like this. I didn't know it could go so far. And I tried to reveal the part of me but you can't find no scar. And I lie about it, and Itell them I'm feeling fine. And I'll cry about it, hopingtomorrow will change my mind. Happiness has come to this. And God, it's such a heavy burden to bear. [footsteps] What's going on? Oh, just hold on a minute, OK? I got the tomatoes and thepeppers from your garden. Sorry you [inaudible] time. [footsteps] What? Do something wrong? I don't want anything from you, Kristin. It's just dinner. Hungry? So how was it? Pretty good. Yes, ma'am. What? You sound surprised. I am. God, they're bright. That's because we're a mile closer to the sky than Vegas is. It makes me dizzy.

So should I be insulted thatyou're not coming on to me or flattered? I guess that's my [inaudible],, isn't it? Yup. I guess it is. You know, a person could lose himself out here, find some peace. Not that easy. I'd settle for a place whereI'm not scared all the time if I won't have to run anymore. You run, Kristin? Just like those guys in the garage. So, Mr. Enigma, are you going to strike it rich, drilling for oil? Water. I figure, if I get this up andrunning, I'll be able to tend myself a real garden. Sounds like a lot of work. Anyway, I like fixing things. Yeah, well, some thingsjust aren't worth fixing. Then you've got to be smart enough to walk way and not look back. It's easy for you to say. [footsteps] Hot? Yeah.

People, this bank is goingto be pregnant for one night only, OK? $7 million dollars pregnant. $7 million dollars? This is a Lozroko pile, isn't it? So? Millions of dirty dollars in this bank for one not only on its way to fucking Mexico. Tony's going to shit. Let me worry about that, OK? On Saturday, that money willbe deposited in La Marage. And on Saturday night, withthe help of Mr. Barnes, we will go into that bank unseen. We will appropriate thosefunds for our own use. You never said you were stealing from your own brother-in-law. No, I didn't, did I? No, you didn't. You know how much your share will be? He's a fucking mad man. He'll kill us. He'll be so busy trying to explain this fuckup to his bosses-- He'll never got a chance to explain. You're setting him up. Oh, what? So we're worried about Tony now? I thought you hated his guts. OK, I'll give him a perfect patsy-- a fall guy for all seasons. Jake? So now you're worried about him? He's a mutt, baby, aloser, lost in the desert. Well, he can stay lost in the desert forever. You got a problem with that? Kristin. [grunting] You, bitch. Hey, Barry. Take a walk, Phil. [breathing hard] [inaudible],, baby, what youmade me do to your sister. Don't, Barry.

She lied about being thrown off a bus. She's-- she's staying with you? And she said her boyfriend dumbed her, but that was bullshit too. You've got some girl staying with you? Rosie, she's trying to get mein heat so she can reel me in. She's a fake. Oh, and just how do you know that? Because I've been there before. It's a failing of mine. Are you fucking her? Well, are you? No, Rosie. I'm not fucking her. There's a guy working with her. A guy? A guy? What guy? Smokes cigars, wears fancyshoes, came to the house in the middle of the night.- Shit, Jake. We have to worry about this. We have to worry about this. I knew she was scared. Now I know why. I don't care why. You get rid of her now. No. Tonight. She stays. We need to know what they're doing.

[kiss] [music playing] You know, I used to stareacross that border every night and dream about the land of opportunity, but dreams and realityare two different things. I'm hungry, Jake. I'm still hungry. Oh. But it's too late to eat now. I have to get back. So, uh, what movie did I see tonight? [keys clinking] [footsteps] Jake? Shh. Go back to sleep. Goddammit.

He needs your help. That doesn't make any sense. The most we every carry is $20,000 in cash. It just wouldn't be worth it. Well, then Barry knows something you don't. There's a lot more than 20 grand. This Barry's your boyfriend? No-- yes. Hell, he owns me, Jake. Look, when I first met you-- I was just a john. I was supposed to get you to pick me.

I was sent to Vegas for a shootand fell in with a bad crowd-- grass, coke. I got hooked. Plenty guys were willing to pay for my habit. And after a while, Ididn't care who they were or what they did to me. I met Barry at a party. There was this dealer whom I more money than I could ever pay, and he owed Barry money. So-- so he-- he sold me to him. Barry got me dried out. Well, he owns me. He's connected. He married Anthony's orphaned sister. They put him in charge ofthings, you know, like me. I still sleep with people,Jake, whoever he tells me to-- he and his brother-in-law. And that son of a bitch used me like a dog. I ran away after that. Barry found me in two days. You know what he did to me, Jake? Nothing. But he found my little sister. He found her, and he cut her, slashed her lips open sideways like this. She didn't know who he was or why he did it, just as some guy came out of hell and cut her with a knife. But I knew. Yup. I knew, and I could never forgive myself. [footsteps] Jake. What? I don't know how to get out of this. [opens door] [crying] [music playing] [engine roaring] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] Y dos tequilas, hombre. Rapido. Let's go. Come on. Oh, man.

I would be nice if it wasyou and me on desk sales. I'll be there. Then I'll know. You've had some serious disappointments in your life, huh, Jake? Just one. Why don't you tell me where she lives, and I'll take care of her. She got killed. I'm sorry. No. It was my fault. Let's do it. [engine sounds] [knocking] Get the door. [opens door] Well, Jake. How nice to finally meet you. Yeah. Kristin's briefed you on the job. Let's cut to it, OK? You know my associate here? A very fine recon man. He cased you, the bank, the vault-- everything. [laughs] I do know how to do this. We need you to dismantlethe bank security system. I'm listening. I play straight always. Fine. Then we split the money fair and square. Fairly, yes. But according to everyone'srelative contribution. Your cut is 15%. Nice talking to you. Mr. Barnes, I do understand. I mean, I'm breezing out of town. I'm done, but you're throwingaway a whole life here. You've got a history in this town. People know you. People will be looking for me. That too. 20%. And without my code key, it'll take another hour to crack the safe. 30. 25. Cash at the split. Where do we do it? Your place. OK, but we leave the guns in the car. We have a deal. How long do you need to get in? A few seconds to shut down the system. Good. How long for the lock? With your key and the oneprogrammed into this computer, we have no problem. We're dealing with one of thenew Brinkman electrons, right? That's standard. No special modifications? Fine. This baby will crack in seven minutes max. That'll work. A plus moves, say 11. Sheriff drives throughevery half hour on the nose. Every hour he gets out ofthe car to check the door. We watch him do his thing at3:30 in and out at 15 max. It gives us at least a 12 minute cushion. Well, that's it. Let's go. She stays here. I don't think so. You got what you wanted. Very well. Be here tomorrow. Early. [footsteps] Fuck! I hate this shit. Why? I mean, she's only doing what she does. And what's that? You know, you sic her on a John, and she does what she does, right? [slap] What? So she's the whore and I'm her pimp? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Only you can't stand to hear it. She owes me. She owes you shit. You think she loves you because you love her? I think she'd like to see you dead. Phil, please don't think. I know you mean well, but it'llonly get you into trouble. [pats] [music playing] [footsteps] [engine roars] You going to be OK? [kissing] I'll be fine.

Let's wait until this is over, OK? A certain kind of tension goeshand-in-hand with masterminding this kind of operation. Sit down. I don't ask much of you, Kristin. No, Barry, you're not at all demanding. Can I remind you of what youwere when I first found you? You were a little coke whore, dead meat with the vultures circling. That's-- That's the truth. What were you? Dead probably. That's right. I gave you your life. Can you ever pay off that debt? Can you? No. Now you're talking the truth. So what about this Barnes? What about this Barnes? You have feelings for him, don't you? No, Barry. Nobody needs to get killed in this. Oh, yes. He has to die. It's the only way to get Tony fast. You do have feelings for him. No, daddy. No, I swear.

Then let's get to work. In the back. [SINGING] In her eyes, I seethe Indian summer, in her smile, a beautiful child. My inside is as empty as the sky. Her sun is so hot and so wild. This road is like a snakein a deep tequila drink, riding in the desert to shake a demon's rage. Holy se orita, rescue me before I fade away. In her eyes, I see the Indian summer. In her smile, a beautiful child. And my inside is as empty as the sky. Her son is so hot and so wild. I say we go in. Fuck the fucking sheriff. No, Phil. We do not fuck with the fucking sheriff. One dead cop, and they'llnever leave us alone. There could have beenan accident on the highway or a barroom fight. We're not way of knowing. We should have brought a scanner like I said. Shut up. OK, let's assume thesheriff's missed this too. God, I hate to assume. Can we go in now? [beeping] 347. Give me your key. We've got 13 minutes.

You didn't have a gun? Didn't need one. Sweet. [music playing] [footsteps] [creaking] All right. Open them up. [clicking] Shit. Where's my fucking money? I admire your style, Mr. Barnes. Shut up. Car in the garage? There's a leather bagbehind the driver's seat. Bring it in here please. [footsteps] OK, let me see. Let me see. You already cleaned out the money, right? Very good. Very, very good. What was your cut? A half? A third? A half. Great. You just gave Kristin a lot of traveling money. Shut up, Phil. She'll be back. [music playing] Thanks, Kristin. Now what? Go ahead, Phil open it up. [unzipping] It's all yours. Take it and go. He's offered us the fucking money. I don't want it. What do you mean? I mean, that's a good deal, Barry. This is fucking great. You lied to me. You let this little prick get to you. That's not real professional, Kristin. Back off. Barry. I don't want the money. Pack it up and get out of here. I told you I don't want the fucking money. Well, I fucking do. Put it down, Barry. Come on, Barry. Fuck this. [gunshots] [moan] Right there, Barry. So here's the deal. You keep the money, and I take Kristin. He's working an angle, Jake. Shoot him. She thinks she's one smart lady, Jake. But really she's just a little whore. He knows that, Barry. He knows everything, even that you pimped me to your own brother-in-law. Tony made me do that, baby. Don't you get it? He fucked you to teach me a lesson. Teach you a lesson? Yeah, I was going to leave my wife, my kid, everything, for her. But Tony couldn't let thathappen, not in his family. He's crazy, Jake. So he had her to dishonor me. This is all about you gettingeven with your brother-in-law? My oath. This is all about your honor. Honor, yeah. But now I'm teaching him a lesson. The bank was his operation,and I fucked it, big man. We'll see how big a man he is when he has to tell his goombah family that he lost their money. Since you're a man ofhonor, I guess that makes everything all right. God's truth, Jake, I love her. [gunshots] [crashes and moans] You're shot. You're shot. I gotta tell you, Jake. I'm not real impressed with your new gang. [laughs] Now get up. Get the fuck up. I thought you were going to stay in Juarez. But I'm just a bad penny. Look, Pysches. Take the cases and go. We don't need any more killing. Oh yeah, we do bloody. A few more bodies willreally fuck up the trail, don't you think? Huh? Don't you think? Now who's the asshole bleeding on my money? Don't you mean our money, partner? Pick it up, Psyches. You stay there, Jake. You're good on your knees. [moaning] You two going to head back across the border? You want to know something? The only times I've been to Mexico were with you in that cheesy motel. I'm from Seattle. What'd she promise you? You die. You die, and then I get your cut-- pretty simple. [gunshot] [footsteps] Simple is stupid, remember? Just get the case, Ed. How long you've been planning this? Years. We were just waiting for the right jerk-off to come through town. Well, you two sure had me fooled. Then you were just about thebest piece of ass I ever had, Rosie. Now when you said Ed neverfucked you like I did, that wasn't a lie, was it? Was all your bitching and moaning about his cold, limp dick bullshit too? Don't listen to him, Ed. [blows] [moans] Fucker. Who's dick's limp now motherfucker? [groaning] Ed! [gunshot] Ed. [gunshots] [flames] [cocks gun] [crash] Jake. Jake. Loverboy dead, baby? No way, baby. [gunshot] Don't be silly, Kristin. [gunshot] [clicks] It shouldn't end this way, baby. I love you. [click] [gunshots] [moaning] [gunshot] [clicks] Come on. [flames] Get out. Come on. You're getting out of her. Come on. Kristin, bring the car. Rose, we've got to get that beach bag. I'm keeping my share. Nobody's keeping anything. I'm not leaving with nothing. You've got your life. That's more than you offered me. [explosion] You OK? Yeah. Come on. [music playing] Rosie, stop! Go, go, go. We've got to stop here. Let her go, Jake. We've got enough money. She's not going anywhere. We have to stop her. [screeching] Shit. [music playing] Stop! Stop! What's happening? We're too late. [gunshots] [crash] Oh my god. Pull up slowly. What are you doing? This is where the dust settles. They're going to kill us, too. You have to trust me now. [music playing] Keep your hands where they can see them and get out nice and slowly. [close doors] [footsteps] Is that the money? Yeah. I think you should put it down very slowly. [footsteps] [inaudible] Where's the rest of them? Dead. Ed? Dead. Barry? I don't think hisbrother-in-law will mind. Hell, one more dead foreigner here don't make much of a difference. Mr. Lasarco said to tell you that he owes you. I don't suppose I'll see you at work on Monday. No. Be careful now. Always am. I'm talking about her. Good bye, Herman. [speaking spanish] [opens door] Is it over? It's over. Now it's you and me? So now we know. Let's get out of here. Time to quit.
