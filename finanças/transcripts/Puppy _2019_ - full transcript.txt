He would've thought nothing. Shut up! I came since you called me. The phone is ringing, right? Answer it. It's my friend only. I'll talk to her later, mom. Your coffee is here. Please, Ramya. I'm sorry, Ramya. Come here. Sorry, Ramya. I didn't expect that to happen. I swear, I'll never take you out without informing you. It's been days since I had seen your smile. But still you're very mischief. Shall we go out today evening, Prabhu? I told you that my friend is getting engaged today. - I told you, earlier. - Yes. - What will you be doing, today evening? - I'll be at home only. Then, come along. I can come... but I don't know anyone there. Is that a problem, Ramya? I'm there for you. You're coming, we both are going. - Okay? - Okay. Puppy, you're rocking! "On the side walk of the road."

Nothing, senior. What are you thinking? What's the matter, tell me? I don't know how people eat pizza! It's watery like rotten food. Why that frowning face ever since I came here? What happened? Should've come last week itself. Not yet come. That's why. Who should've come? Who didn't come? My friend loves a girl, sincerely. Wrong. - One day, when she was alone, - When alone? - When she was alone... - We're also alone, tell me. They became intimate, senior. - Intimate? - Yes, senior. He's manly, you're a wastrel. So, what's the problem now? If we miss the periods cycle normally, it's not a problem. But, after we made love, if I miss the cycle now. - Missed the cycle? - Yes, senior. No problem, right? Senseless, if she has missed the periods, ...it means she's pregnant. Hey, what are you saying? Senior! - For me and Ramya... - For you and Ramya? - For me and Ramya... - Tell me. It's over. - Is it over? - Yes, senior. Looking like a child, you've given a child. Excellent! She is saying as pregnant... I'm afraid. What should I do? Hey, my friends are worried for not having a child after marriage. It's the boon of the god. You must take it to the cradle. How can I take to the cradle being unwed? You're speaking like a goof. Instead of telling me a notion. Hey, why should I think? Hey. You'd have thought on the day, you both were intimate. Why should I think? I'm worried as nobody is allowing me in the football game. It's gone, my life is gone! - Notion! - What? Pregnancy test. We'll check with it. Everything will be solved. Senior, it's pregnancy test kit. Did I say it wrong? Yes. Do one thing. Go to the medical shop in the corner of the street… …tell them your father's name is Kamaraj. He left to the job. I've played along with Ramya. And so it came. What's that you said something, exactly? - Pregnancy test kit. - That's it. Buy and give to Ramya. She'll hit you with her footwear. Finding corrections. Senseless idiot. Did everything and blabbering to me. I thought you'll help me. - I'll commit suicide, senior. - Look here, sit down. Do whatever, but don't weep. Puppy looks better when weeping. Your face is awful. Damn it. Come on. - Senior, - What? - Senior, will you buy it? - Get it. - Get the socks too. - I'm coming. Go and buy. Senior, the shop is in our street. If anyone watch me buying, it'll be a big problem. What to do? Shall we go to another shop? Hey, go and buy. - Senior! - What? There are only women. - Are you feeling shy? - Yes, - I too feel shy. - Shall we go to another shop, then? Hey, you brought me too far to Poonamalle. This is the last shop. After this, we should go to Ranipet. It'll take two days to go. Hey! Did you buy it, senior? Why should I buy? It's you who did. Go and buy it. - Senior, - What? There are only men. Are you feeling shy? Yes, senior. I'll hit you with my shoe. Wastrel. No business. Welcome, brother! It's sad thing. When old people in home have pain in joints, legs and hands. This 'Zandu balm' will take care of everything. It costs just Rs.35 Not this. Not this? What else it would be? It's not enough. The milk is not enough for your brother's child. Don't worry, the lactogen will take care of. Just Rs. 250. Neither that. Then, what else do you want? Oh, I understood. I'm your age too. Don't be shy. Brother, ask me frankly. Chikku, Orange, Strawberry, Mosambi., Even ice- cola and pineapple flavours are arriving this week. Don't worry. Take it. Neither this. Hey, why do you say it's not this or that? What do you want? - Nothing. - Brother, you've become tensed. This is how, someone got tensed… …went home straight and hanged himself to the fan. But, he didn't die. Why? Why? Because, he hung to the table fan. How can he die? - I'll go to some other shop. - Brother, You can buy things in all the stores except this? Which store? Which store? It's the sewage. Fun! Brother! I'll come. Where are you going? Just a minute. Ask me whatever you want. Don't feel shy. I'm like your brother. I need... ...'pregnancy test kit'. - To you? - Not for me. For my friend, Kishore's girlfriend. For meager Rs.50 product, I cracked five jokes too. Oh, gosh! Hey, why are you smelling this? If you'd have bought it, why do you need this, now? Take it. Give the money. Hey, wait. What? - Why are you giving only one? - Then, will I give nine? There is an offer, 'Buy one and get one free'... Give it. Who is he? Your uncle? Why? will you give if I'm his uncle? Take it. - Drum nose. - Why do we need two? - Give it to her. - Take it. Give. Take it. Go and give it. What? It'll be useful for next month. - Congrats! - Bye. You bid bye and coming back? Superb! If you do so, will soon close the shop. Do you remember what to buy? And don't say anything after going home. - Mom, we didn't take the curd packet. - Yes, I'll bring it. Puppy! Go...go... Hey, why are you roaming like a diabetic? It's been a long time since we gave. Call her and find out. - Hello! - Hello, Ramya! What's the result? It'll take five minutes. Wait, Prabhu. I'll call you back. I'll be on line. Check and tell me. Okay, wait. Ramya, what are you doing? Check and tell me, soon. Hello! - Hello! - What happened? Got the result, Prabhu. Say immediately, without suspense. It's negative. - Negative? - Yes. Did you check it right? Yes, I checked it. It's negative. Good, Ramya! I love you so much, Ramya. My dad is calling. Just a minute. I'll call you back. Hello! - Senior! - What, Prabhu? It's negative, senior! Have you become a"Dad"? Hey, wash your mouth with phenyl. Nothing so. - We've escaped. - Escaped? Phone is ringing. Take it. - Whose phone? - Your's phone. Who's calling? Ramya. My girlfriend! - I'll speak and come. - Go and speak. Hello, Ramya! - What's this? - What? It shows 'positive' in another tester. 'Positive'? Yes. Who told you to test in another one? Who told you to buy two test kits? Hey, that was an offer. 'Buy one and get one free'. That's why, I bought it. If I buy you forty, will you keep testing on everything? Goof, you're. Why are you talking so? Then, how to talk? If positive, it's problematic. Heed me, don't call me, henceforth. You're someone. I'll block your number. What? Will you block my number? Yes. Tomorrow morning, I'll come along with my parents to your home. Then you know, whether we both have relationship or not? What? Dad! - Hey, Ramya! - Hang up the phone. Hey, Ramya! Hey, it's switched off. Hey, who told you to buy two kits? Buy one and get one free. Hit me. Hit me. I was the middleman for you and your puppy. Hit me. Better, you'd have hit me. Saliva... If anything happens to me, I'll cut off your tress, not to act in any of the films. - Hey, where is your son? - Why? - Call that vagabond. - vagabond? - Speak respectfully. - Hey, get up. Get up. What, mom? disturbing in the morning? You need sleep too, for what you've done? Get up. Come out. - Mom. - Come out. - Listen here - Tell me. - Is he sleeping, big cheese? - Yes. Don't speak more. - Let my son come out, I'll ask him. - Isn't it? Hey, why are you shouting to them, equally? You must be blamed to bring them as tenants. Is it a hall of thousand pillars? Just two rooms. - What is he upto? - He is good. - Do you know what he did? - What he did, tell me? Not only does he befriended my daughter but impregnated her. Oh, no! - Why are you blaming my son, falsely? - Who is blaming? If it's my place, I'll cut him into pieces. - Dear! - What? I gave her hot coffee, yesterday. See, how she talks now. I too gave clips to hang your clothes. Is it good to say all those in public. If you give the clip, your son will impregnate my daughter. Good family! How arrogantly is she speaking. If he was born with sisters, he'd know the value of a girl. Did I say not to have? But, she denied. See, what question did he ask? Reply him. Dear, is that important now? Shut your mouth. Call your son and ask him. Mom. What? He has come. Look here. Ask your son, grown up six feet height... ...whether it's true or not? He has done everything and standing like a buffalo. Hey! - Hey! - Dad! Come. - Come out. - Dad! Hey, is what she says is true? Dad! Tell me, is it true? I've made a mistake once, without knowing. Did you made once, by mistake? You can't do, henceforth. Oh, It's there! - Lot of twists in this story. - Yes. - He fell for her. - Yes. - Don't know what to do now. - That's why, torturing me. - Don't know about pregnancy. - We're coming now. - He was stuck, can't escape. - He can't escape. Sing along, don't care him. Clap! Yes. Don't leave. Hey! Just a minute. No, I'm in composing. Senior! Please, come. Boys, carry on. That's it. What? Are you coming or not? I'm coming. Wait. What? Hey, I'm in a problem. You're enjoying there. Sister, give me water to drink. Senior, Ramya came home with her parents. Dreamt like that, senior. Sister, change your saree. Hey, don't you let me to have water? What can I do for it? I don't know what to do, senior. I feel giddy. I’m afraid senior. See, one of the pregnancy test result is negative and the other is positive. It's dangerous for us, if we still ignore it. Let's speak to a known doctor and conclude it. Is there any doctor known to you? Doctor known to me? There is a doctor known to my dad. - If we ask him... - He'll thrash us. Why are you getting me caught to your dad? Senseless! Don't do anything. I'll speak to the doctor known to me. Okay. A doctor known to his dad? Take it. What's this? If you take this pill, your periods will become normal. Who said? Hi. - Does he know? - I don't know anything. Why are you humiliating me, everywhere? What does he think of me? Is that the problem now? First, see how to solve your problem. My problem? Ramya, we got this pill consulting the doctor known to the senior. Take this pill, everything will be normal. You aren't like before, Prabhu. Hello, take this pill after food. If you don't take this pill, everybody will spit on you. I'm also one among them. Hey, what are you thinking? Nothing, senior. I feel guilty. Yes, we do wrong but doing it right consulting a doctor. Don't be afraid. I'm with you. Even the phone is ringing. Good time ahead for you. Stop aside. Let's go after speaking. It's call from the doctor. Good evening, doctor. Tell me. Did you buy the medicines I said? - We gave her too. - Got 5mg? - No, that's not available. - So, we bought 30mg. - 30mg? - Yes, doctor. - You said she is 20 years old. - Yes. If she take this pill. What will happen, if she takes? She'll bleed heavily and get epilepsy. That means? She'll get fits and die, fool. - Will she die? - Die? Who? I don't know if it becomes a police case. I'll switch off my phone. Why are you scaring as police? Hello! What happened? Tell me, first. Call her and tell not to take the pill. Why, Senior? Listen me, first tell her not to take it. What happened, tell me. Hey, if she takes this pill... If she takes? ...Will bleed heavily and die. - Hey, what are you saying? - I didn't say, the doctor said. Call her. She is not picking up the call at emergency. Call her. Ramya, pick up the call. - Doctor. - Tell me. - Is Doctor there? - He is in washroom. Ask him to be there. I'll come along with the police tomorrow morning. Hang up the phone. I'll come in the morning. What? She is not picking up. Then, why are you sitting? Take the bike. Oh, no! I just thought of playing the match. - Go upstairs and inform them. - What? Myself? Her family knows I'm the house owner's son. It'll be a problem. - Then, move away. - I’ll tell her. What will you say if her dad opens the door? I'll tell, If your daughter takes the pill, she'll die. Don't speak like a goof. It's gone. I heard the ambulance sound in the corner of the street. Ramya would've been admitted in the hospital. Tomorrow, we'll be the sensation in the media. - Damn sure, we'll be imprisoned. - Who will be imprisoned? Yes, you'll go. - Why should I go? - It's you who changed the pill. You're the first accused. Why are you talking so? Will I caress you for the idiotic job you've done? It's gone.

Ramya's parents, come out from upstairs. Senior act well. Come on. It seems he had left. Shouldn't have his friendship, henceforth. Let me get up and run. Why are you looking at me, like a coffin box? - What happened? - Chest pain. - Hey, what are you doing? - Chest pain. - Press him. - Okay. Hey, press the chest. - You mean chest? - Say, clearly.

Why are you shouting? I did your favourite dish. Just taste it. I don't want food or anything else. Oh! - Dear! - What? Hey, you got suspension from the college for six months... ...and sitting idle at home. How dare you behave arrogant as no one questioned you? Dare to yell her for asking you to eat? - He asked me, isn't it? - If he asks you? There is a limit. I'll thrash you. Hey, eat and go. He'll eat outside. Look at your work. Hey, will you join us to play? It's become routine for you. Really, I'm asking you. Will you come to play? Will you come to play? I was waiting for this for one and half a year. Will I deny?

Going to the temple, consulting a doctor, even spending lakhs... ...is not be blessed with a child. Instead of giving birth to the child, you killed it... ...in the womb and now weeping. Leave me, mom. Let me go somewhere and die. Your name? Ramya. Age? 22 years. How long have you been married? You've come for the pregnancy test, isn't it? Tell me. How long have you been married?

Is it possible to get married and have a child at this age? No other way except abortion. You don't know the value of a life, Prabhu. I can't do this. Positive or negative.
