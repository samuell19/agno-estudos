That's good. -If you want to get together for lunch sometime, i live in the hills near the strip. -[ Sighs ] I'm married. -You're not wearing a ring. -[ Smacks lips ] Still married. -Mm. Okay. [ Door opens, closes ] -What's your problem? Fucking married? You need to learn to have a little fun, Paulie. -Ah, can't be too careful, Elliot.

I'm on the ladies, so call me back. -Who was that? -My gram and 8-ball dealer. You gonna delete that? -Yeah. Of course. [ Camera beeps ] Stupid. -This is your cut. Already stepped on it for you. -Already got a guy on a line for in. Operates out of a motel room. -What's the price? -$150. -[ Scoffs ] Elliot, I love you, but you're a thief. -It's a great price. -It's ridiculous. It's way too high. You're gonna get pinched. -I don't know. I think you ought to meet him. I think he'd be willing to move much more than that. -Okay, see, the price is too high. Did the guy have an earring? -I haven't met him yet. -Well, you better keep a lookout, because narcs always seem to have an earring. It's like they can't help themselves. -I have an idea. How about you let me mind my own business and you think of another ingenious plan for the two of US? [ Chuckles ] -I know you're down, but this side-by-side thing, it's kind of a one-time shot. I run solo. No partners, no entanglements. I can't have any reason to think twice. Don't look at me like that. It's nothing personal, man. -Sure. Yeah. -Besides, it's getting increasingly difficult to pull these off. And lately, I feel like I'm just chasing my own tail, running in circles. Eventually, I'm just gonna run up my own ass. -[ Chuckles ] Yeah, whatever, man. I figure the day you tell me your real name is the day you quit, so I got to know you're good for one more run. -It's just a name. What difference does it make? -None, I guess. Just -- you know my name. All I know is "Paul." Fuck it. Here's to taking it to the limit one more time. Well done. [ Wind chimes tinkling ] [ Hinges creak ] -Oh, good. It's the police. -D.e.a. Now.

Rafael garza is a dangerous breed. -You wearing a wire? -Would you believe me if I said I wasn't? -Probably. -It's "Paul" now, right? Whatever happened to "haddison Brock III"? Or, uh, "Barry green" before that? -I get off on names. -Why don't you come work for US? We'll send you down south. Throw US a couple of spics. -I can't work with bigots. -Look, I know you're a good guy. And we let you skate along because you're not hurting anybody. But I need your help on this.

I'm trying to appeal to your sense of, uh, greater good. -[ Scoffs ] -So, you let me know when you change your mind, and I'll start getting used to your new name. -This is a really bad time, Paul. -Where are you? -I'll call you back in a sec. -Elliot, listen. -We're by Beverly and Fairfax. I'll call you in a sec. -Wait. Damn it! [ Engine turns over ] [ Siren wails in distance ] [ Cellphone beeps ] -You nervous, too? -Mnh-mnh. Come here.

[ Clears throat ] Don't -- don't talk to me like I'm one of your boys, all right? You want to hire me to do a job, you know where to find me. And, uh, my quote just doubled. -Fuck. -Actually, $150. I mean, like, uh, if it's okay with you guys... [ Gunshot ] -Sorry. I don't recognize him. -Well, it was worth a shot. The feds think some mid-level trafficker is moving in on me. Name's Rafael garza. -Some friend drag you into this? -I don't keep friends. -Partner, then? -You know me better than that. -What about that whip-smart lady? She got pretty close. -And I ended it. -Okay, first thing you got to do is find out the reason you're in this shit. -Oh, I get it. Just -- what should I do? -What saved my ass. It's cutting people loose. Most people aren't built for speed. It's not their fault, but they will bring you down. I ran solo for seven years... And I forgot one time. Look where I am. -Now it gets better. D.e.a. Made me an offer -- piece of the score if I go to bat for them. -Are you a fed now? -What do you think? -I got a healthy disrespect for the law. Go find Bobby "bad breaks." Show him this video. He is a fucking rat. He won't tell you anything, but if he knows this guy, i guarantee he'll try and use it for himself. -And the rest? I mean, they got me in a pretty tight spot here. -They don't realize it, but pitting you in a corner has made you dangerous. -Just tell me if this is the smart move. -[ Chuckles ] [ Buzzer sounds ] -You carrying, brother? -Paul. -We all know that's not true, but I appreciate the manners. -Nice place. Little dark, maybe. -[ Chuckles ] -So, let's lay this out, yeah? -Oh, this is good. You're fun. See, it's not what I expected. -What, someone been telling tales about me? -Someone. But how do you confirm these stories about this man without a name? -Exactly. -I've got product. It's got to move. -To where? -Right here. All through Mexico. -And when? -Normally, we expect to lose 30% of our shipment across the border. You know, acceptable cost of doing business. But now that number is 60%. We want to move right now. -That's too soon. The whole thing would ride on my prep time. What's my cut? -How do I know if you're any good? -Must've got a glowing recommendation if you went through all this trouble to find me. -You couldn't have gotten a better one. -[ Chuckles ] -Now you see who really runs my show. I wonder if you would've come if you knew she was here. -[ Chuckles ] I'm here 'cause I don't want to see anymore bloodshed. Makes the rest of US look bad. [ Sighs ] Tell me if I'm wasting my fucking time here. [ Gun cocks ] -What does that say to you? -Was it the swearing? -These people depend on me. We're family. Javier. That's my cousin. Junior is my sister's boy. Gabrio -- I don't know where the fuck he comes from, but you see why I like him? And you. So I'm responsible to them, loyal. You work alone. Maybe you don't know what that's like. This is why you need to answer my question. -You've been losing 60% of your shipments. So, two things happen if this idiot shoots me. First of all, everything white in here is fucking done. And second is the most important part. You brought me here for one reason -- to do what you can't. So, he shoots me, nobody makes any money. Huh? [ Finger snaps ] Next time you hear from me, I'm back in the states. I'll give you a time and a place for the pickup. -[ Laughs ] Ah, I see. I had to see what kind of man you were... Had to see if your reputation was deserved. But I don't like your face. -[ Clears throat ] -I don't like the way that you look at me. Okay. You'll get a call. Or you won't. Then you can piss off to wherever the fuck it is that you come from. [ Door closes ] -[ Grunts ] -This is not a game. -[ Sighs ] It's a wonderful game. Hey. I know what I'm doing. -Right. Because when things don't go your way, you can just run away. -I didn't want you to get hurt. -You know, "Paul" is going to take a little getting used to. You look more like a Ringo. -[ Chuckles ] Come on. Ringo? I'd have thought I'd at least rate a John. You know? [ British accent ] Or a George. -[ Chuckles ] Be careful with Rafael. Keep one eye out behind you. -It's good to know you still got my back. -It's good to see you again. -Yeah. [ Telephone ringing ] One ticket, please. -Show started 20 minutes ago. -Well, I'm just killing time. -$10. Hey, look, it's Bobby. -Bad breaks. -Yeah, don't call me that. -[ Laughs ] -Listen, there was some kid here snooping around looking for you. I figure that's worth something to you, right? -Where are you? -I'm at the theater. Where the fuck else would I be? -Meet me at rascal. -I'll see you there. -Now. -Son of a bitch. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. [ Grunts ] Who are you -- a fucking cop? -You know who this is? Tell me. -Eat shit. -You tell me who this is. -What's in it for me, you cocksucker? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. No! No! No! No! [ Whack ] -This guy -- he shot a hole in my friend. Now, am I gonna take that out on him or am I gonna take it out on you? -He told me to meet him at... -Where?! -...at a bar c-c-called rascal. -That's bullshit. -[ Grunts ] No, I swear to god. -[ Chuckles ] Fucking faggot. [ Car alarm beeps ] [ Cellphone rings ] -Paul. -You've got a green light, Mr. Boxer. -I want to see you. -And you will. -You know, I never made you make my phone calls. -You never let me do anything. -[ Chuckles ] That never stopped you before. -I don't have all the details about that right now. -[ Chuckles ] He's there, isn't he? -That's a distinct possibility. -Liv, I need a week at least. -I will have all the specifics tomorrow when I pick you up. -No. -Hang up. -Rafa, be quiet. -I can't work like this. I need time. -Excellent! I am so pleased to hear that you are open to this arrangement. -You're not listening to me. -7:00? Even better. I'll pick up coffee on the way. -God damn it, Liv. -Okay. -Fuck. [ Door beeps, unlocks ] [ Door closes ] [ Muffled conversation ] -I don't want it. -I don't want it, either. But if we're going to protect what's important... Then we need to embrace these sacrifices. Unless you don't want to go. I could send junior. You could stay here where it's safe. -He trusts me. That's an advantage. -He's not the only one out there. -You're always looking out for me, but no one will hurt me as long as they know that I'm with you. [ Engine turns over ] -Hi. You look good. -Do you usually travel with that much coke? -This is baby laxative. Makes a good cut. It's also perfect for practice. -Have everything you need? -I'm not...Convinced I should tell you anything. -The only stake I have in this is that I want you to do your job very well. -I figure this score with Rafael is to, what, study how I work, report back to him? -I heard stories about the smuggler who put people before product, going to extraordinary lengths to foolproof his scams, only to slip across the border completely undetected. Even if the names didn't match up, it didn't take long to figure out who they were talking about. -Well, it sounds like a fairy tale. -You don't have to guess with me. I know you're talented, and I know you can deliver. I want you to do this job the way you like to do it. And if I learn a little along the way, all the better. -Why did he send you? Why did Rafael send you and not some guy from the goon squad? -Because they're... Unpredictable. He wants this to go smoothly. -This isn't the life for you. -Not your choice. What you thought you'd leave, and suddenly I'd go straight? Hmm? You're not the only one who likes a little excitement. Tell me what you need, Paul. Numbers? Reconnaissance? You want to do a blind run? I'm your girl. -Rafael's made it pretty clear that you're his girl. -I belong to me. I choose what to do and when. Just like you. -I need a stuffed animal. Maybe two. They help me sleep. -[ Chuckles ] I can think of better ways to get to sleep. [ Chuckles ] [ Dog barking ] -[ Snorts ] [ Sighs ] The trip is the best part. -[ Grunts ] [ Both chuckle ] Fuck. -Can you get meth? -You don't fuck around with that shit, do you? -No. I just... Know somebody that could buy it, that's all. -Oh, you do? Big fucking surprise. -[ Chuckles ] -There's no money in dealing meth. -Okay. -Oh. -[ Sighs ] -How about coke, then? -Yeah. -[ Moaning ] Oh, god. Oh, this shit's so good. It makes me feel... Expensive. [ Moaning ] -You should take an ad out in the back of the weekly, selling two-for-one blowjobs and blow. -[ Chuckles ] And with you, giving blowjobs will begin to be like, "I'm a millionaire." -What? Fuck you. Just the coke. -[ Sighs ] I know that you have a plan. [ Moans ] You're so smart. I really like you. -Yeah, I like you, too. -You got all this swagger and -- and sex appeal. And you got this great fucking drug. -Yeah. -But what really turns me on... It's when I look into your eyes. I see my future. -[ Sighs ] This is embarrassing. -Henry... ...I'm in love with you. -You've got great taste. [ Knock on door ] Are you expecting anyone? -No. [ Gun cocks ] -[ Gasps ] Oh, fuck. Am I under arrest? -What are you doing, man? You're throwing your life away, your career. Want to rip off a few dealers here and there, that's fine. You want to screw around with some skank off the street and end up with god knows what? -Fuck you, man. Seriously. -We're in love. -Ma'am, I apologize. Now, listen. Do you know what this does to me, seeing you like this? You have always been a goddamn wild man, but now you're on the cusp, pal. Can you see that? -You gonna rat me out? -Do you need me to? -[ Chuckles ] Fuck. You can't cross me. -Oh, yeah? Why is that? -[ Chuckles ] You know, I've busted and beaten and shot to shit more degenerates than you or anyone else. They gave me the fucking award of valor for that. I'm a goddamn hero. -[ Chuckles ] -All right. Please sit down. I don't appreciate having your dork in my face. -[ Chuckles ] Not yet, anyway. -[ Chuckles ] That's right, baby. [ Chuckles ] Mm. -Henry... You can go around shitting on everyone you know, and soon enough, you're gonna find out how little rope you have... Or you can shape up, under that badge, under me, and be the decent human being that I know you're capable of. -[ Chuckles ] -I like this guy. We should share our coke with him. -We should. -[ Chuckles ] [ Giggling ] [ Man speaking Spanish ] [ Door closes ] [ Tapping ] [ Silverware clinking ] -You know what you're looking for? -Pharmaceutical cocaine burns clear. Elicit coke still retains some of the alkaloids from the Coca plant. Burns clear, but it'll leave a reddish-brown residue behind. Now, the heavily cut stuff, that stuff just turns black. Leaves lumps. -What did I tell you? -Now, crystals of pure cocaine will dissolve as they reach the bottom of the glass. Yeah. Think I just saw some top-tier cocaine here, Raul. I'd say 80%, maybe 85% pure. -What's the price? -$15,000 a key. 10 kilos. You're a pretty girl, and I'm honored you came down here to deal in person. So, $120,000 for 10. -Done. -That's more than last time. -Costs are going up -- Coca farmers, lab costs, supplies, transportation. You do the math. -I have done the math. You buy your paste directly from andean farmers. They've harvested and dried the Coca leaves for a buck and a half per key, treated it with $300 worth of potassium carbonate and kerosene, then drained and delivered it to you as a thick brown paste. Cost to them is about $800, and they sell it to you for $1,000 a kilo. Then they treat the paste so that it yields cocaine hydrochloride, also known to US as coke, snow, blow, toot, Charlie... And okeydoke. -Lady knows her dope. -It takes 2 1/2 kilos of the paste to produce 1 kilo of powder, so your investment lands US at about... $25,000 or $30,000 for the full amount here. -So, how long you been working with Rafael? -Who? [ Chuckles ] Long enough to know it's been too long. You know all about that, right? -Well. So leave. -It felt good, rafa bringing me into the fold. Felt like I was a part of something. I hadn't felt like that in a long time. I'm not going to say that he's a good person, but he's good to me. -I don't even know what a good guy looks like anymore. -I do. [ Chuckles ] Rafa's scared now, and it's making him dangerous... And pretty terrible. One day, he buys guns for junior and Javi, and now people are getting killed. I can't live like that. -If you need money -- -i don't need money. I need options. The men rafa reports to -- you don't just leave. You disappear. You used to be pretty good at disappearing. How about doing it again? -It would end my career. -This isn't a career. You survive on idiot luck. -Well, you said it yourself. I know what I'm doing. -How long do you think you can outrun the bullets? -You're asking a lot. -I'm offering a lot. [ Children shouting ] [ Exhales deeply ] Pardon me. Can you help me? I noticed your uniform, and I have a question that I bet you can answer better than anyone. -What is it? -My passport. It's expired. Do I need it to get back into the United States? I'm in trouble, right? -Well, do you have a u.S. Driver's license? -Yes! Wait. Yes, I have it. -There you go. Just show it to them when you re-enter. It is all you'll need. -Oh, my stars. I was so worried! Oh! One more thing. Do you think I could have one of those stamps in my passport book anyway? -It's unlikely. Sorry. -Ay. What a bummer. Because look. Here I have Italy and France. -Oh, ma'am, I don't do -- -oh, and here is when I went to Buenos Aires. -Hey! Look what I found. -Oh! That's lovely! Where did you find it?! -Oh, it was just sitting right here. I guess someone left it behind. -Oh! Do you have children? -No. D-Did you want it? -Oh, no. No, no, no. Thank you. -Excuse me. I have a daughter, señor -- a baby girl. -Oh! Why don't you give it to him? -Yeah. What's her name? -Isabel. -Isabel. That's pretty. Hope she likes white. -Gracias, señor. -Knock yourself out. -Thank you. You've been very helpful. [ Turnstile creaking, man speaking Spanish ] -He wants to raise his stakes to 17%. -Absolutely not. -He's worth it. -Are you learning his techniques? -Oh, he's keeping his plans very close to him. -But you've been close to him. What have you two been doing all this time? -Ay. Don't do that. -I have never doubted your love for me. Hmm? -Hmm? [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Say whatever number will make him happy. It doesn't matter. -You can't turn on him. -Why not? -[ Sighs ] Rafa, listen. I know you don't like him, but your future -- -no. Our future. -Our future depends on backing his every move. -[ Chuckles ] -If you don't honor the number, who else is ever going to confide in US again, hmm? -We'll always have each other. -[ Sighs ] What are you doing? -Are you lying to me? -[ Chuckles ] Why would I need to? -I'm worried that you're planning to leave me. -[ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] -Phew. Christ. Am I right? -Have you ever been to Mexico? -[ Chuckles ] Just tell me where to find him. -Carried the rabbit through customs like he told me. They asked me to put it through the X-ray, and then they asked me more questions about what's inside. I didn't say nothing. And they detained me, and they brought in the rabbit. They cut it open, and all the coke fell out all over the table. I knew my fingerprints were all over it, so I helped them clean it up. -Wait, wait, wait. What about the dogs? -The dogs? They couldn't smell nothing. He wrapped them in dryer sheets. -[ Chuckles ] This guy a fucking fraud? Junior, let me tell you. A dog smells like we see, okay? If I make menudo, you see the different ingredients, but it just smells like menudo. A dog, well, he can't see well enough, but he can smell the garlic, the onion, the patas. You cannot mask cocaine in dryer sheets. The dog, he just smells the cocaine and the dryer sheets. -I think maybe he wanted me to get caught. -[ Chuckles ] -Yeah, I think so, too. But the question is, why aren't you in jail? -The officer -- t-the one from the park, he told them that a man gave me the rabbit as a gift. -Ay, dios mío. He handed all my cocaine over to la migra. -No, no, no, no. They said the cocaine was not cocaine. -What do you mean? -It was a laxative... Para UN niño. -What are you thinking? -Where the fuck is my cocaine? -[ Scoffs ] [ Ringing ] -You're almost home. I'm 10 minutes away. -Make it 5 if you can. Be ready to roll. Terrific. [ Insects buzzing ] [ Birds squawking ] -[ Chuckles ] Sorry, asshole. [ Gun cocks ] Some people just have it coming. -You look like you've seen better days. -Fuck! -I don't know what to tell you. I don't mind spending the last 14 hours escorting you across the border, but a 12% cut of zero is still zero. I can't make a move if there's no cocaine. -I'll get it back. -How? [ Door opens ] -What are you doing here? -Waiting. For you. Did you get it through? -Did you know I'd be followed? -Where is it? -Answer the question. -I think Rafael knows about it -- -answer the question. -I didn't think you would lie to me. -I didn't lie to you. I kept you in the dark 'cause it was better for you. -Being unaware is never a good idea for anyone. Rafael is a loose Cannon. I am the one he loves most, and I'm not even safe. -And how do we fix that? -We could go back to the beginning, with your name. -No. Not now. Did you know I'd be followed? -What is your name?! -Did you tell them how to find me? -[ Chuckles ] If you get caught, it's going to be someone else's fault, right? Because you couldn't possibly make a mistake on your own. -Yeah, that's right. I work alone so I have no one to blame but myself. -I was on your side. -You share his life. You share his bed. And you're scared of him. I have no reason to believe anything you say. Even if you are telling the truth, you don't have the full story. I mean, come on, Liv. Would you believe you? -How much time do you need to have it ready? -How long till he has my money? -Not long. -I can help you get out. I just can't go wherever it is you're going. -Then there's no point. -[ Sighs ] [ Monitor beeping ] You know, to be honest, I'm surprised they went for it. Must've been mystified by all the antics. They missed the most obvious sucker move in the history of dumb sucker moves. I mean, come on. How are you gonna deny it's yours if you're practically wearing it? -Mm. She pissed? -Can't get ahold of her. -That's not good. -You're looking better. -I'm straight beautiful, man. Thank you. -[ Chuckles ] How long till you're on your feet? -You know where he is? -[ Sighs ] I found the motel where he's holed up, yeah. -What's his name? You see that son of a bitch, you tell him I'm fucking coming for him. -I'm sorry how we left things. [ Speak Spanish ] [ Grunts ] Paul, ayúdame! [ Engine revs ] -Where is she? -You can't come ins-- -where's Olivia? -How did you get in here? -You have your dope. Where's my cut? -Get his hands. Get his hand! You stole my cocaine, and have balls enough to come in here asking for money, for my Olivia? Oh, you want it all, don't you? How good it would feel to smash your fucking head in right now. -Okay. Okay, I-I still got it -- your dope. -You gonna tell me where it is? -Son of a bitch! -Where's my cocaine? Where is my cocaine? Where is my cocaine?! -Safe. It's safe. It's far away from here. -Then you're gonna take me to it. -What do I look like -- an asshole? [ Chuckling ] Oh, fucking shit! -[ Laughs ] -[ Groans ] -Claves. -I don't have it. What does he want? -Keys. -I don't -- I don't have them. The other guy took them. -Hey, gabrio. [ Speaks Spanish ] -Olivia didn't come back here? [ Engine turns over ] [ Handcuffs clicking ] -Like this? -Yeah. Just make it tight. -[ Chuckles ] Now what do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? -[ Chuckles ] -What do we do? -Can you watch her? -Yes. Do I get a gun? -[ Sighs ] Yeah. -This is too big. -Okay. Hey. I'm relying on you, all right? -We're so set, baby. -[ Chuckles ] -I've never taken down a cartel before. -I got to go. -Do you want to get high first? -Oh, absolutely. [ Cellphone beeps ] -$150. that's right. That's right. -What the fuck? -I don't know if I can do that, actually. $150, I mean, I got -- if it's okay with you guys -- [ gunshots ] -Hey, where you going? -Don't let anyone in. -Slumber party. [ Chuckles ] [ Car alarm beeps ] [ Engine turns over ] -Now, what did you do? And don't lie to me... Or I'll fucking blow your brains out. -[ Muffled talking ] -[ Sighs ] Now spill it. Why did he arrest you? I want to know what kind of scum my man took off the street today. -That man is a cop? -Henry is an award-winning special agent. [ Doorknob rattles ] [ Banging on door ] -[ Panting ] -Paul! -Let US go. I'll give you the video. -How many copies did you make? -Not many. Fair enough? -[ Chuckles ] -That looks like a service weapon. You know, you fire that, you're gonna have to tell somebody why. -Fuck you. Stop moving. -Come on. You know I have it coming. -Shit. [ Engine turns over ] [ Horn blares ] [ Gunshots ] [ Tires screech ] [ Tires screech ] [ Engine shuts off ] [ Drums beating rhythmically ] [ Indistinct conversations ] -Don't have it in you, do you? Didn't think so. [ Thud ] [ Sirens wailing in distance ] -Paul. [ Gasps ] Don't! Stop. -Where's the coke? -The girl took it. -Where? -Or maybe I took it. -What are you doing? -Or maybe I call the cops, or maybe I call Rafael. Oh, the possibilities are endless. It doesn't matter what I tell you. You can't trust me, remember? -No, that's not what I said. I said you don't know any better. -That's worse. -Vamos. Olivia, vamos. -Paul! I need you. -Vamos. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Vehicle door closes ] [ Speaking Spanish ] -[ Cries ] [ Engine shuts off ] -Hey. -Stay with the car. Walk straight ahead. -[ Humming ] -Stop here. [ Gun cocks ] On your knees. -[ Grunts ] [ Gasps ] [ Breathing sharply ] -This might be a little loud. -[ Shudders ] -[ Singing in Spanish ] -Now, listen to me carefully 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. I have a message for you from Arturo rezendes. He says your contribution to this case has been well noted and will be rewarded. So lie low and let US take it from here. Your job's done, man. -You're d.E.A.? -L.A.P.D. I was recruited, just like you. Now drink your water. -What? [ Coughing ] [ Coughs ] You're the one who taught me to run solo. On my own. No partners, no entanglements. -I know I did, and I said I met a lot of fine people in the game. But none of them have shown up here for a visit except you. You are the closest thing I got to a friend, kid. Come on. You got a woman who loves you, who you love. Be smart enough to lay it all on the line for something of real value. [ Ringing ] -You better be long gone, my man. -We need to talk. Come by my place in an hour. -You've got some balls if you're still in -- [ click ] [ Ringing ] -Asshole. -You remember our favorite office building? Meet me in the parking garage. Bring my coke, or I turn you into an Internet celebrity. -Go fuck yourself. [ Click ] [ Ringing ] [ Cellphone rings ] -Hola. -You know who this is? -How the f-- -i have what you want. If I deliver, I walk away clean. That's it. -Sure. You deliver, I let you walk. -I want Olivia. -Motherfucker! [ Engine shuts off ] -The hell's this shit? -Paul thought he'd send me in his place. I'm his partner. -I don't know what you have planned here, pal. If you come out slowly, i promise to blow your head off real quick. Nobody's gonna miss a piece-of-shit dope dealer. -[ Gasps ] -Keep quiet. Give me the bag. [ Horn blares ] -Henry! [ Horn blares ] -Shit. -Henry! -[ Groaning ] I had it coming. -[ Screams ] -I have what we agreed on. $150. That's right. -Um, I don't know if I could do that, actually. $150, I mean, I got -- if it's okay with you guys -- [ Engine shuts off ] -[ Sighs ] [ Grunts ] -Sleep tight. -Olivia? Baby? Olivia? Baby? Come on. What are you doing? -Stay out of my way. -Come on. Come on. -Stop it. -Come on. Come on. Come on. Where are you gonna go, huh? -Back to Mexico. -Oh, back to Mexico? That is fucking crazy. This is your house. -No! I'm leaving. -You're not leaving. Hey! Fuck! -[ Gasps ] -All of this is for you. It's for you. This house... All the money... It's for US. This is so we can have a life. -[ Sobs ] -[ Chuckles ] [ Gunfire ] -[ Speaking Spanish ] -Okay. -Paul! -Come on. -Hey! Is that my cocaine? -All 10 kilos. -How do I know? -Trust me. -[ Chuckles ] Open it. -Let her go. -She's a free woman. She could choose wherever she wants to go. -[ Screams ] -Hey! -Hey. Come on. -Put the gun on me. I got your dope. Let's finish the deal. -I'm not giving you a single peso. -I only want her. -Those are noble words from a man who threatens to shoot me. -I'm sorry. This gun's not for you. -What are you doing? -I'm getting you out of here. -What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? -I know what you're thinking. Might not be your dope, right? -Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [ Police radio chatter ] -Was this all part of your plan? -Wasn't it yours? -Thank you for coming. -Yeah. Well, you're free now. You can go anywhere you want. -Mm-hmm. Right. The world is mine. -Hey. If we're gonna be together, there's something you got to know. -Can I arrest her? -Let them go. -[ Chuckles ] You have a girl's name. -[ Sighs ] Yeah. Yeah, I do. I think I like "Paul" better. -[ Chuckles ] I can't believe I told you. -[ Chuckles ] [ Police radio chatter ] -Late last night, special agents were able to seize 10 kilos of cocaine with an estimated street value of $1.2 million. We also seized several guns, which is always near and dear to my heart. [ Camera shutters clicking ] [ Clears throat ] Killed in the line of duty was special agent Henry langlois, who's undercover work laid the foundation that made this operation the success that it was. His heroic sacrifice will not be forgotten by his brothers and sisters of the drug enforcement administration. -That was the scene nearly three years ago this month, and today, I am joined by former cocaine dealer Paul boxer. -Smuggler. -Smuggler. Fair enough. He's just written a new book entitled "why did you write my name in the snow?" The times newspaper is hailing it as "a rare cut of dry wit and relentless insight." So, Paul, I assume that's not your real name. -No, it isn't. -I'm not even going to ask. -Thank you. -Something that I'm sure puzzles a lot of our viewers is why make your living from something as notoriously dangerous as the drug trade? -Well, I do have a very healthy disrespect for the law, but the cocaine business is just like any other business. You got your importing, your packaging, the quality control. You want to make sure what comes in is fresh and pure. Best I ever got was 87%. It was so good, I had it stolen from me. -[ Laughs ] -So you do meet some nasty people. -Sounds like a real wild business. -A smuggler bleeds like anybody else. We just get more chances to prove it. -♪ I walk alone ♪ this path is not my own ♪ I dream ♪ in vain ♪ The waters rise ♪ I hear the screams ♪ from underground ♪ I won't run ♪ when I am done ♪ we'll be under ♪ ohhhhhhh ♪ I'll make this right ♪ I'll build a bridge ♪ that's crumbled down ♪ take this chance ♪ to die against the man I've been ♪
