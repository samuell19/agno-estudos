Oh, thank you so much. It's OK. I can't believe this happened. My name's Jennifer Hansen. Hi. Is there anything I can do for you? Oh, don't mention it, it's all right. There must be something I can do, anything? Well, I am looking for a place to rent. A place to rent. Um-- oh, of course! Hey, my building. This guy, he just moved out.

LAVINIA: $550 a month, utilities included, and you owe me first and last. Are you married? JAKE: Not anymore, huh uh. LAVINIA: Good. Then you owe me just first. That'll be great, thanks. You wouldn't happen to have any girlfriends, would you? No. Wonderful. Now, I don't mind you bringing a lady home for a night or two, but should she decide to spend many evenings here, you're going to have to pay me an extra-- mm, $100 a month. Well, you don't have to worry about that. Wonderful. Well, what do you think? I like it. I'd like to call it home. Good. Is there anything else I can do for you?

Hey, listen, if you get him, let me know, OK? I want to kick him in the ass. Yeah, I appreciate it. Bye. I can't believe this crap. The son of a bitch is going to kill me over a car. That's too bad. - Who are you? - Jake Baxter. Oh yeah, yeah, Missouri. No, Minnesota. Yeah, whatever. Hey, listen, like I told you on the telephone, you get three times the owner's payments. If the payment's $100, you get $300. No bullshit, no insurance, no advances, and no benefits. Hey, I don't want to hear anything about double keys. If I had the key to the car, I'd have my grandmother go get it. OK? Sounds good to me. OK. Come with me, You finished with this car yet, Jam? No. But check it out, Skid. (RAPPING) I ain't no Einstein, but I ain't no dope, and it's clear to see that we're losing hope.

BULLDOG: Oh yeah, clean the shit out of the cars that you bring in. If you get a few dents in them, don't worry, he'll fix them up. But wash them, wax them before you get paid. I don't want to have to do it. He'd have to get up. I heard that, Skid! [car horn honks] Ah, this is Lippy. Son of a bitch! Asshole! Bastard! BLONDIE: As you can tell, he's a real fun guy. What happened, Lippy? Your boyfriend wasn't in the mood? Same that always happens. Why do I always get the shit pick ups? You didn't get the car? No, I didn't get the car. Well, what a surprise. Hey, up yours, Jam. You always get the easy ones. Someone give the poor guy a tissue. [imitates a baby crying] Man-- wasn't my fault. JAKE: Hey, uh, excuse me. I wouldn't mind giving it a shot.

Are you an actress? Trying to be an actress. I work in a plant shop, though. Actress working in a plant shop. Go figure. How about you? Did you find work yet? You bet. I'm working as a repo agent. A repo agent? That's kind of risky, isn't it? It's OK. It's not too bad. I really gotta run. I'll drop by again. Maybe I'll bring your another plant. Thanks a million. Yeah, my place could use a little help. [laugh] Bye. Bye. Good luck today. Thanks! Yo, Jake! What's up? Exactly what did you do in the Army? I was in the Marines. Machine maintenance, why? You ever work on choppers? Why? Can you fly one? Who wants to know? This chopper for repo came over the computer today. How much? $3,000. I'll take it. Hey, you didn't answer my question. What was the question? Can you fly one? Come on, like riding a bike. Once you know how, you never forget. See ya. Yeah, but can you fly one? Move closer! Get off! Get off! [shouting] Get off!

My mother warned me something like this would happen. I'm sorry. She warn you about anything else? As a matter of fact, they both warned me not to move out here. They don't like what I'm trying to do. They want me to move back, and get married, and have a nice family. Something stupid like that. Yeah, that's real stupid. JENNY: You know what I mean. They want me to go back home. And where is home? JENNY: Colorado. How about you? JAKE: Minnesota. Where the Minnesota Vikings are from. We're the Halloween capital of the world. JAKE: Why do they call it the capital? Well, we have the greatest parade you've ever seen. JENNY: Sounds like a blast. So what do you think of California? Little loud. Sunny, hot. Then why are you here? Make some money. You can't do that back there? I got to make some quick money. Why? You ask lot of questions, you know that, don't you. Well, you should be grateful. Most people out here don't ask questions at all. They just like to answer them. Well, this must be my lucky day. I had a nice little business back in Minnesota, then the highway came right through there and took all my business away. Now the bank wants to repossess my lot. If I don't come up with $60,000 in three months, I'm stuck out here. Well, we wouldn't want you to be stuck out here in this torture chamber, would we? Don't they repo cars back there? Yeah, sure they repo cars, but business is booming out here. Shows you what kind of state it is. Listen, talking about repoing cars, I've got to go. I really do. Why? I gotta go repo a car. Just eat and run, huh? Listen, this was swell, I'll never forget this meal, but I'll make it up to you. I promise. OK? Fair enough. Hey, thanks a million. Thanks a lot. Sure.

Hey Blondie, did you ever hear the story about this blind man standing on a corner with a seeing eye dog, waiting for the light to change? The dog pisses on his leg. The blind man takes out a cookie and gives it to the dog. The guy behind him says, "I can't believe this! Your dog pissed on your leg, and you're giving him a cookie, why?" He says, "I wanted to see where his mouth is, so I could kick him in the ass!" [laughing] Hey, check it out. Waldo's sleeping again. Quick, get the [inaudible] stick. [waldo snoring] BLONDIE: Shh!

People get killed with these things. We haven't buried anybody yet. Will you listen to me? Now, this thing was built for one reason; to win, and it's going to win, no doubt in my mind.

I'm talking about a no lose, can't lose, impossible to lose situation. Can you drive that thing? Watch this. Hey, Jam. JAM: Yeah? How would you like to do a couple laps for 100 clams? You're on.

Hey, Bulldog. BULLDOG: Yeah? Happy birthday. It's been a long time. JAKE: Uh-- yes, it certainly has. Too long. JAKE: What do you mean? I thought you were happy when I left town to become a boxing champion. I thought I was, too. But after you left, I became lonesome. Very, very lonesome. You filled a space in me, in my life, that no one else could. My bed is cold and unfeeling, my sheets are crisp and dry. My body is restless. Come back to me, to my life, to my arms, my lips. You have a line, Jake. Oh, yeah. You betrayed me, and now you're changing your mind? How can I trust you again? Don't. Just love me. Oh, wait a minute. You're really not going to kiss this guy, are you? [laugh] It's called acting, dear. Yeah, but you really don't kiss the guy, do you? Huh? You really are from the Midwest, aren't you? You bet I am, and I'm proud of. You know, to tell you the truth, I really wish I met more guys like you. Yeah, well, remember? You wouldn't let guys like me. We're the kind of guys who like to have nice little home, nice cozy little family. That kind of a thing. JENNY: I almost forgot. Any luck getting your $60,000. Yeah, I met some guys, we're going to do a little auto racing with them [inaudible]. Racing? Have you ever done that before? Eh, a little bit. Not bad at it. You want to try and finish this scene? OK, where were we? It was right after the kiss. Yeah. That was wonderful. Yeah, some things never change. I love you. Do you want to make love? Yeah. (LAUGHING) We're [inaudible] Hey, look, I can't do this. Jake, won't you relax? No, I-- this is not me. I gotta-- - Jake! - I gotta go. - Come on. - I'm outta here. Jake! I'll see you later. [laughter] [soft music playing] That's nice. What is it? That's Jam He's good, isn't he? He's great. God, I love rooftops at night. Gives you the feeling you're the only person in the whole world. It's not easy feeling you get around here. Tough to get the feeling anywhere, nowadays. I bet I know what kind of kid you were. I bet you were the kind of kid whose best friend was a frog in his pocket, dog as his side, hunting with your dad. Well, that sounds good, but not quite. I grew up in the Bronx. You grew up in the Bronx? Yeah. My dad got me interested in racing, so I raced for quite a few years, and then I quit that. Moved to Minnesota. JAKE: What'd you do that for? Oh, god. I was married for a long time, and my wife got real ill. She was in the hospital, and I was driving for this race team at the time, and she begged me to stay with her. I had to go drive this race, which was real important to me at the time. I won the race, I came back, and my wife had passed away. After that, I just kind of quit racing. What was that important race? Time trials for the Indy 500. You would've been in the Indy 500? With the time I had, they said I could have won. And you just quit? Just gave it up? Well, after my wife died it just didn't seem that important to me anymore. Now I think about it, I wished I wouldn't've quit. Hey, you want another beer? I'd love one. You'll come right back? I'll be right back. Be careful. [TIRES SQUEALING ON STREET BELOW] [indistinct talking] Jennifer? Jenny? Jenny? Jake! [crying] Stay back, man! You know, I could have Stan here increase the pressure of that hold a couple of pounds and your neck would snap like a chicken's. But I'm not going to do that, cause I'm a nice guy. But don't you ever, ever come after me like that again, or I will kill you, you fucker! [crying] Put him down. You son of a bitch bastard, I oughta slit your throat from ear to ear, right now. But you see, I can't do that, because I've got this little problem, you see, I gotta make a lot of cash, right away. So I'm going to bet all of my money. But you see, I only bet on sure things. And by sheer luck, I think I found this sure thing. It's you, at the Slam Track championship. Now, I want to make perfectly sure you understand exactly what is riding on you tomorrow. If you win, hey, it's cool. I forget about the little tussle we had the other day. I might even make a car payment. But if you say, come in second-- you lose. So you know what my advice to you is? Win. Now you get a good night's sleep, and you show up at that track tomorrow, and you win. Good luck tomorrow. As a matter of fact, let's see how good your reflexes are. [screams] Hang on. It's all right. It's all right. I'll get you some water, hang on. [gasping for breath] JAKE: I'm really sorry. [crying] Who were they? Who were they? Don't worry about those guys. Listen, I want you to do me a favor. Listen to me. You gotta go to Colorado for at least a month. No. You got to do what I tell you to do. What are you going to do? Don't worry about me. No, Jake. We can-- we can go somewhere. We can leave together tonight. We can going to Minnesota-- No. Yes, come on. You gotta go to Colorado, just like I told you to do. You understand? Jake, no. You've got to do what I tell you to do. Jake, they don't want to hurt me, they want to hurt you. You're going to Colorado. Here, I got $5,000 for you. Jake, no! I gotta go. (WHIMPERING) [inaudible] for you. I gotta go. I gotta go. You take care. (WHISPERING) I'm praying for you. ANNOUNCER: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen! I'm Jimmy the Grim Reaper, and I want to thank you for attending the 1990 annual Slam Track championship, the world's only race that promises no guarantees. Cheer for find down and dirty, supersonic, gut ripping, [inaudible],, kickass auto action! All right, before [inaudible],, warming up the Slamsters right now, get ready to start in just a few minutes. That's not gonna leave a whole-- BLONDIE: Woo! ANNOUNCER: --lot of time for you gamblers down there to get the last of the kids' college funds on that lucky car. So get your tails in gear. Get that money down, make the big bet, because once the action start, we're going to close it up until some lucky winner pulls out that lucky car! You lay a bet on this race? Yeah, $5,000, why? Did you bet on Jake? Yeah, $5,000 to win. Why you ask? I just saw Lincoln and Jake over there talking, and then they shook hands. Think they fixed the race? I don't know. If I laid that kind of dough out, I'd sure as hell find out. Yeah. Hey, Jake. What's up, Bulldog? Well, you're new around here, so I thought I'd fill you in on the history of this race. See, this isn't a spectator sport. You don't see thousands and thousands of people around here. This race is private. Very private. See, everyone around here's a degenerate gambler, including myself. I'd say we're a bunch of dreamers, following that big dream. What're you trying to say? Why don't you just get to the point? Are you going down there to win that race, or did Lincoln buy you off. Nobody bought me off, goddamnit. Now, what are you doing with Lincoln, then? Well, if you really have to know, he laid $50,000 out for me to win this race. And you get part of that, don't you? You might say that, yeah. Oh, I knew it. I knew it. Hey, have a good race, Jake. ANNOUNCER: All right, you got your Reaper back with ya, and I've just been handed a late entry. We got ourselves another repo man in there, Mr. Darnell "Jam" Jones. He's riding with K&K too. Now I know what those repo boys do with the cars they steal. All right, everybody, we're gonna get ready to rock and roll. The lights are on, the music's playing, and the drivers look ready. The last one driving and the last one alive is the big winner. There go the lights, here we go, stand back. It's going to get messy from here on in. The gates are closed, all bets are down. We got a yellow light! In five, four, three, two, one, do it! Yeah! Yeehaw! Ain't nobody stopping us now, [inaudible] tappinng each other on the back. [inaudible] But wait a minute, hold the phone, what's this? Boo, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Repo Man! That's right, ladies and gentlemen, it's the new kid on the block. It's Jake Baxter slam, bam, thank you, ma'aming his way past everybody. Holy turbo jet, Batman! This good old boy's going all the way home. [inaudible] up at 22, Jake Baxter's pulling away, way, way, way up front. This boy's on fire! [inaudible] got to be awful mad right now. And if I know what he-- there he goes! He's starting to throw his weight around. [inaudible] He's slamming another one into the wall, cause he don't like to lose. He'll do anything it takes to win, but he still can't catch that new repo man. He can't catch him at all! That's right, Repo Jake is out front, and it looks like he wants to stay there. But unless I miss my bet, Bucky Slash ain't going to let him do it if he can help it. Bucky Slash is gonna catch his ass and gonna break his [inaudible]. There he goes, it's Bucky Slash, and he's gonna ruin your paint job. Hoo, that was awful close! Go Jake! Come on, yeah! Run him over! ANNOUNCER: Look out! He's catching Jake. Oh, no, wait a minute.

People get killed in these things. BLONDIE (VOICEOVER): You gotta do it, Jake, for me. KING (VOICEOVER): You see, I only bet on sure things. It's you. Come on, Jake! I know [inaudible]. ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] 101 freeway in rush hour. But now he's back, and he's hot to trot into the hotspot. He's moving past all those other outhouses on wheels. Hang on.

And Bucky Slash, trying to catch up to the two front runners. It's getting hairy out there. Hey guys, take it easy on the transmission, try using the brakes once in awhile. I hope you're all wearing your seatbelt. [inaudible] Bucky, I warned ya, he's spinning out-- there he goes! Oh, Bucky's going to need [inaudible] There he goes. He's coming back into it. Now he's gonna be [inaudible]. I've never seen [inaudible]. Oh, this is gonna be the best Slam Track race ever! If only it were legal. Well, you can't have everything.

Oh my god Shut up. Man, you had it all. How could you blow it? How could you screw it up? Do you know what you did? (YELLING) Do you have any idea what you did? I'll tell you what you did. You just committed suicide. Hey, shithead. Get the hell outta here, old man! Shoot him, man! You might hit one of us. I guarantee you. Hey, wait you waiting on? Shoot them, man! Come and get it, punk. You son of a bitch! [gunshot] Everybody leave, except for him. (SHOUTING) Leave! Come on. Listen, Mr. Kovar, the race was a sure thing. I'm so screwed up [inaudible].

SKID: So anyway, I says to this-- [indistinct chatter] [inaudible],, did I ever tell you the time about the blind man and the seeing eye dog? He goes into a department, and he takes the dog by his right hand, and he swings the dog around over his head. Saleswoman comes up and says, what are you doing? Can I help you?

JAM: (RAPPING) I repo cars, I'm slick and smooth when I move. All I need is a minute and a screwdriver will do. And if you're late on your payments, the sorry is what I say, but I must make a living. I take your car and get paid. Yo I ain't no Einstein, but I ain't no dope, and it's clear to see that we are losing hope. The world has no honor, the world has no class. But I'm must say paid, I take your car for your cash. KING: All right, girls, it's that time again. Let's round them up and move them out. Hey, Waldo. BMW, 1987. Skidmark, you got a '82 Buick.
