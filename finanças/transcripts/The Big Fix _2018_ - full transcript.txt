[upbeat funky music] [knocking at door] - Hunter, let me in! - In a minute! - You've been in there for an hour, brother dear. - Olivia, you know that creeps me out! - Oh, brother dear. Let me in! [gasps] - Geez, have some patience. - Get out! - Oof, your breath is nasty! - Your face is nasty. [door bangs] - No, no, no. Call them back. No, security cameras need to go in today. - Morning. - Michael, you're not wearing that. If we want the mayor's wedding reception, they'll require them. Can you hurry? We're running late. - For what? - Listen, I gotta go. Just call them back. We need them in today. Seriously? - What? - The new menu? We gotta finalize it today. - Karen, you must have had that conversation in your head. - Why do I feel like I'm the only adult in this house? - Everything will take care of itself. Besides, you do the business-y stuff, I'm the chef. That's always been the deal. - You get the fun, I get the grunt work. - How 'bout I stay home and you do all the cooking? - Excuse me? - [sighs] Mornin'. Lovely as always. - Don't get smart with me. - Still needs her coffee. - I'll just grab a bar. - I made an entire breakfast. - I'm good. - Looks good, thanks Dad. - You're welcome. - I quit. I'll be in the car. - I'll drive. - You drove yesterday! [upbeat music] ♪ Whoa ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Move along ♪ ♪ Say it baby ♪ - Open the door.

This wedding can pull us out of it. - You'll figure something out. You always do. [gentle music] [students giggling] - Excuse me? Excuse me! Let's all focus in here together and be here now. [students laughing] Oh, I have some very exciting news for you. The school board has asked us, well all of us, to put on a play for the annual voter registration event for the senior class. [claps lightly] Yes? - The rally's this weekend. - Yes, Miss Marin, it is. Very astute observation. And that is why we will be hosting auditions this very afternoon. [phone ringing] Oh, excuse me. Oh, I have to take this. Hello? [students laughing] Oh, hi darling. I haven't spoken to you in ages. This week? Um, excuse me, hold on just a second. Break many legs, my tiny thespians. I don't know about this week. It's a very busy time for me. Maybe next week? Oh, it's this Saturday. - [Alexis] So I guess you're auditioning? - Yeah. - I always get the lead. - Congratulations. - She ask about me? - [scoffs] Shut up. - What'd she say? - She was talking about the play. - We have a teensy weensy little problem. - Okay, hit me. - The wait staff is fighting again. - Did you talk to Karen? - No. Listen, Karen's amazing and all but this may require a gentler touch. - Okay. Um, but I-- - This looks really good. Can I try it? - Knock yourself out. - Michael, this is so good. - [Michael] I'm glad someone enjoys it. - [Chelsea] How could you not enjoy this? - Chelsea. Get the staff together for a meeting. - She was complimenting my food. - I have a meeting in 15. It'd be nice if you showed up. [bright music] - Yes! Understudy to the lead! [laughs] And Alexis got the other lead too. Hmm. Guess this acting thing isn't so hard after all. - You have the entire school in your back pocket and now you have to butt into the one thing that's mine? - Macy, I hear you. I understand it's impossible to get that shift in at the last minute, but we have to have it. Yeah. Well, let me know as soon as it's on the way. We're not done. - What? - [Karen] I said we're not done. - Done with what? - We have to cancel housekeeping, remember? And there's still laundry. - I sat down for three seconds. Three seconds. - You can sit down after we're done. - I'm on my feet all day cooking for people. I come home and I cook for other people, one of which never says thank you. - What did you say? - Look, I can't sit down for three seconds without you yelling at me. - I wasn't yelling! - Three seconds, Karen. Three seconds. - Well it's three seconds too long because we're not done yet! Typical. You never finish anything! I'm trying to keep this house and family together. Not to mention our business from going under. If we don't get the mayor's wedding reception, we lose our restaurant. - What happened? You used to be so much fun. - Well, someone had to grow up. We're not done! - Yes, we are. - And how are we done? - I can't remember the last time that you said my name without actually yelling it at me. - Well, if you would be more responsible. - We're done! - What do you mean? - We are ruining the kids. They fight as much as we do. - Kids fight! That's what they do! - Well maybe we need a break. - You want a divorce? - We are splitting this family apart. The stress, it's too much for us, it's too much for them. - So you'll be happier with someone like Chelsea? - What? I am trying to come up with a solution and you're picking another fight. - [Karen] I'm picking another fight? - [Michael] What do you want, Karen? - [Karen] You started it! - [Michel] You're the one who followed me up here. - On your phone not doing anything! - What do you have to say? - Three seconds! Three seconds, Karen, come on! - [Michael] Well you think I do nothing? Do you see what I do? - [Karen] Of course, you do everything, right? - [Michael] Just because I'm not crunching numbers, you think I sit on my butt all day long? - [Karen] You do here! I am the one who does everything here. - [Michael] Congratulations. - Looks like we're going to became a statistic. - If Dad would just take more responsibility. - Mom needs to lighten up. "Why can't you two just grow up "and learn to get along?" - Can you stop touching my stuff? We don't get along. It's not like we can take a break. Unless. We need to talk to you about something. - Uh-huh, what is it, hun? - I know Hunter and I have been fighting a lot lately. [Michael scoffs] And while we still love you guys very much, we just feel like we can't live in the same house anymore. - Cameron says that I can stay with him for a while, just until we can sort things out. - And he can come home on the weekends and I can stay with Gabbie. - Absolutely not. - It'd be better for everyone. It's not your fault. - Well, it kind of is. - Are we really listening to this? - You two are not going anywhere. - We'll always be a family. Nothing will change that. We just need to be a family-- - From a distance. - You two stop this nonsense right now. And fix your hair, it's a mess. - So it's nonsense when we say it. - But not when you say it. - What are you talking about? - We're not dumb. - Or deaf. - You guys fight constantly. - Well, that's different. - How? - We're adults, for one thing. - So you should be able to get along better then. - Look, it's complicated. You wouldn't understand. - And breaking up our family is less complicated? - Do I need to pull this car over? We'll continue this conversation later. - And remember, our family business is nobody else's business. - In 1 Corinthians, Paul explains what love is. Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. - [Karen Voiceover] My husband clearly never read that part. - [Pastor Drew] It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable. - [Michael Voiceover] Obviously Paul wasn't married to Miss Control Freak. - It does not rejoice about injustice, but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up. - [Hunter Voiceover] Fire one, fire two. - [Pastor Drew] Is always hopeful and endures through every circumstance. So then, God is all of these things and we are made in God's image. - [Olivia Voiceover] Such hypocrites. - So, we can possess all these same qualities. We're gonna take a moment of silence and pray. Whatever we ask in faith, He hears us. Let's pray. [tense music] - [Karen Voiceover] Make sure he hears this message. - [Michael Voiceover] Can you get her off my back? - [Olivia Voiceover] Why is my brother such an idiot? - [Hunter Voiceover] Why is my sister so annoying? - God, fix her! - God, fix him! [gentle music] - So weird. - What's going on? - We need to get out of here. [Olivia and Karen gasps] - Holy Shakespeare! [Karen yelps] - Shh! Let's go. I said let's go. - Well, it looks like the Holy Ghost is working with somebody this morning. [congregation laughs] - What just happened? This doesn't make any sense. - What's happening? No, this isn't mine! This is your fault! - How am I you? I'm not there, how? - Why am I wearing these? - [Olivia] Goodness! - We've gotta get out of here. [upbeat music] [Karen yelps] - [Pastor Drew] Michael. - Great sermon today, Pastor. Thank you. - Thanks, Hunter. I appreciate that. Hope to see you on men's workday this Saturday. - Me? Work day? Oh yeah, um, sounds nifty. - Thank you, Pastor Drew. Have a blessed week. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - [Hunter] Come on! - [Michael] Where are the keys? - Oh, I got 'em. There's so much stuff in here. What just happened out there? You've gotta be kidding me. This is so weird! - Why is this so tight? - This is so weird. - It's like a weird body-swap movie! - [Hunter] Why do you have this? - Well, it's not-- - Stop! People are watching us. - Why do I have this wedgie? - My face has a wedgie. - Okay, let's just go home, all right? [upbeat music] [tires squealing] - I can't wait to get out of these clothes. - Seriously? - Your underwear is torturing me. - Did you even wear any underwear? - [Olivia] Ew, get out! - [Hunter] You get out! - [Olivia] No, you get out. - [Hunter] You get out, I'm older! - [Olivia] Ew! - [Hunter] Ew! Stop. - Why am I so hungry? - All I'm finding are body-swap movies. - We were sitting in church, Pastor Drew was speaking. - Yeah, he was calling you out. - Excuse me, young man? - Oh, sorry, Mom. He was calling you out. - Shut up. - When did you notice the switch? - After the prayer. - Okay, so what did you pray? - That god would relieve me from the suffering of life with weirdo here. - That God would change the weirdo of a sister he gave me. - Stop! Whatever it was, it was because of the prayer. - Let's pray again. - It's worth a shot. You pray. - Why me? - Right. You're not Karen. You pray? - Fine. I'll be the grownup. God, please switch us back. Amen. - Hey, maybe we should all hold hands? - All right. Well we were praying silently when it happened. - We dust beseech thee to changeth us back to who we werest beforeth. Amen. - You're such an idiot. - Olivia! - Well there's gotta be a way to fix this. - I've got an idea. Just be careful with my face, okay? - Let's try to think the same thing. - Okay. What are we thinking? - That's the whole point. Try to think what I'm thinking. - This is ridiculous. - Just try it. Banana. - Carpet. Shrubbery. - Spatula. Shrubbery? Really, Mom? This is useless. - Wait. Didn't they do animal sacrifices in the bible? - That is literally the worst thing you've ever said. - Neighbors. They have a chihuahua. - [Olivia] Shut up.

[Olivia gasps] - We need a plan. - You and your plans. - Well I appreciate your plans, Mom. - What do you have going on today? - You can't possibly be ready for the horror that is high school. - [Karen] High school was a breeze. - Yeah, high school was the bomb. If only I could go back and do things differently. - It's adult life you're not prepared for. - Do you mean we get to run the restaurant? - Can I just hide here until we switch back? - Well wait, I have an English lit essay to turn in today or else I lose a whole letter grade. - And rehearsals start today. - All right. We have to just fake it until we can fix this. - Yeah, we're good at faking it.

[gentle music] - People still use E-mail? - Hey, hot stuff. I really like the new look. Karen. What are you doing in the kitchen? - I was looking for something to eat. What do you want? - I, uh, was just wondering if you'd heard anything about the wedding party. - Wedding party? - The mayor needs a reception location. - And he's coming here? That's a fantastic question. We should consult Hunt, Michael. - Behind me, where are you? Oh yeah, I see you. Yeah, come on, I need help. Now, now, now, now, now! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! [Hunter groans] What? Bro, I gotta go. All right, see ya. - Michael, Chelsea says the mayor is supposed to be coming to check us out for his reception. Do you know anything about that? - Oh, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Your creations are always so inspired. - Do you see what's going on here? - Yeah. - Hunter! - Yeah! Yeah. She wasn't even trying to hide it. - That tramp thinks she can get her hooks into Dad. - What if she already has? - No. No, no, no, he wouldn't. Would he? - I don't know. - That's why we were switched! We need to get rid of Chelsea. - They have a class together? - I guess. - I can't believe you're wearing that. - Good afternoon, guys. Would like to start our class today with some positive affirmational breathing. Inhale. [inhales deeply] Exhale. I am capable. Inhale. [inhales deeply] Exhale. I am my own superhero. Inhale. [inhales deeply] Exhale. [exhales deeply] I can. Very nice. Very nice. Wait a minute. The chi is totally out of balance. You. No, not you. You. Trade places with you. Yes. [claps hands] Quickly, quickly. That's much better. If everyone would take out your assignments, we will begin. - How did you know about this? - It was part of the plan. Hunter told me about the assignment that was due today. - I'm sorry, Mr. Sinclair. - You need to be careful. We may have to reconsider your role in the drama department. - I think that this one more accurately represents the type of clientele that you're trying to attract but ultimately it's your decision. - I agree, Samantha. - Great. On which one? - I really like all of them, Sam. But the one that truly speaks to me is that one. The way the colors contrast. It really captures a bolder, younger spirit, I feel truly represents who they are. - Who are they? - She likes to speak in third person. - She does. - Sometimes. We like this one. - Okay, well I'm happy you're happy. So I will go ahead and get these to the printer as soon as I can and they should have them out to you by the end of the week. [Hunter sighs] - That literally took forever. - Now, how do we fix this Chelsea issue? I say we fire her. - It can't be that easy. - All we need to do is get rid of her. What better way to do that than to just fire her? I know I'm right. - I know I'm right. But you're doing it. - We should do it together. - No way. - Why? - It was your idea. - Please? - No. - Please? - No! - Please? - Fine. - What are you doing? - Trying to look like a committed couple. - Ew, I just threw up in my mouth. - Your face looks like throw up. - Shut up. - Just go with it. - Fine. - What can I do for you guys? - I know what you've been up to and it's not going to work. - I'm sorry, what? - I can see through your little tricks and I won't stand for it. Better back away from my Dad, husband. - Your dad husband? - We're happy together and there's nothing you can do about it. - Oh. [laughs] You must have misunderstood. - Chelsea! You're fired. - Excuse me? - Bye, Felicia. - You'll regret this. [upbeat rhythmic music] - But what I commit today is to change. - So how much time have you spent practicing? It's this weekend. - There's no way they're gonna need an understudy anyway. - I've been watching Brian take Vitamin C like it's candy. He's petrified he'll get sick. - You know, I did just the opposite back when I was in high school. I mean, last year in high school. You see, I rolled around in poison ivy to try to get out of an exam. It turns out poison ivy isn't contagious and you can still go to school. - I didn't see you as a get out of exams type. - Oh man. I was a mess back in high school, last year. - Like your sister. - What's your beef with her anyway? - My beef? [laughs] You sound like my dad. What do you care? Speak of the. - They just took Brian to the hospital. - Brian? Brian! - He passed out in the cafeteria. They just loaded him in an ambulance. Gabbie heard Emma telling Kaylee that she heard the paramedics say it was probably mono. - It's all that Vitamin C. - That's not what... Nevermind. They're saying he could be out for weeks. - Hunter, don't you know what this means? - They've moved you to the lead role. - We're playing opposite each other now. - But if the play is this weekend and we're-- - We need to get home, like now. - Break a leg. - I wish! The lead? The lead! Karen, I can't play the lead. - We've got a few more days. We'll figure this out. - Okay, what if I actually did break my leg? Sinclair would have to get someone else. - Don't worry. We'll get switched back. - [Michael] Hey! - Stupid, stupid head. - What is wrong with you? - It's for show. [upbeat rhythmic music] - Would you stop? - Why can't we just make frozen pizza? - Hey! What took you guys so long? - Doesn't matter. We need to figure out how to fix this. Hunter, you got bumped up from understudy to lead. - No way! That's awesome! - What? That's so not fair. - No, no, no, no, no. That's not awesome. If we don't get switched back, it won't be you up there. It'll be me. I may need to break my leg. - What? That's my leg. - Stop. We need to go back to church. - Please change. [upbeat music] [Hunter scoffs] It didn't work. - We're in the wrong seats. We're in the wrong seats. - [Pastor Drew] Hey guys. - Bruh! So good to see you. - Hunter! - Sorry. - Yes, it's been a crazy week and we're all here seeking guidance. - Anything I can help with? - No. - Yes. - Yes. - No. - Pastor, this is insane. - Well, not insane. - No, it's insane. Why do you have to keep interrupting? - I'm just trying to help. - You're not helping. - Would you two just stop it already? - You ever see one of those freaky body-swap movies? - Yeah, they have 1,000 of them. - Any like that happened in the bible? - The bible? [laughs] You got talking donkeys, people being transported from place to place, dead people walking around, I mean-- - Like zombies? - Well, I never thought of it that way but yeah, I guess. No body swapping though. - But like, you've read the whole thing? - It's kinda like my job. What's this all about? - We've just been having trouble trying to understand each other. - That's common. It takes a lot of time and effort to understand each other. - Yeah but we kinda need this fixed now. - Great. Well, let's get you guys signed up for family counseling. - We were hoping for something a bit quicker. - Well it's gonna take time. I mean, with God we can get to the bottom of this. - We switched bodies. - What? - Sunday during service. I'm actually Olivia. - I'm really Hunter. - Like in those body-swap movies. - Oh, you guys needed more help than I thought. - We were praying during service, we opened our eyes, and we had switched bodies. - That must've been some prayer. - Do we need to prove it? - No. - We can prove it. - Don't prove it. - No, it's okay. It's okay. - [Olivia] He's proving it. - I'm really Hunter. - Stop. - Okay. - I can go faster, Pastor. - Okay, okay. It's okay. [laughs] Let me process that for a second. Assuming that that really happened, what did you pray? - Just that God would help our family. - It was a little more specific than that. - Yeah, I prayed that God would fix him. I mean him. - [laughs] Jokes on you. I prayed that God would fix you. - You guys too? - Have you ever seen anything like this before? Do you know how to fix it? - No, can't say that I have. - I knew it. I'm gonna have to break my leg. - Would you stop trying to break my leg? - Look, the bible doesn't have body swapping but it talks a lot about love. - What's love got to do with it? [Michael laughs] - What? ♪ What's love got to do with it ♪ [Pastor Drew laughing] - This family seems to be missing a lot of love. You see, in 1 Corinthians-- - You were talking about that on Sunday. - You remembered. - Yes, I was hoping that she was listening. - That's exactly my point. - Thank you. - No. You're looking at how much she falls short instead of how you're going to take care of her rightly. God says that we are to be selfless. Take care of each other over ourselves. - All I do is take care of them. - And when you do that hoping for a reward you're gonna be disappointed every time. - So how does this help us? [gentle music] - Well, I don't know about this body swapping stuff but if this family's going to survive, you've gotta start thinking about somebody other than yourselves. - Maybe I won't need to break my leg after all. - It's my leg. [phone ringing] - You have to answer that. - Mom, no one answers the phone anymore. If it's important, they'll text. - It's your Dad's phone. It could be a business call. - Fine, give it to me. Hello. - [Sharon] Hello? Is his Karen Reynolds? - Yes, this is Karen. - Yes, hi. - [Sharon] Oh hello. This is Sharon from the mayor's office. I'm calling about the menu tasting for the mayor's wedding reception. - Yes, Sharon. What can I help you with? - [Sharon] I spoke with Chelsea at the restaurant. I had scheduled the menu tasting for the 17th but unfortunately the mayor has to fly out on Wednesday. So we need to reschedule for Tuesday. - That's tomorrow. - [Sharon] Is that going to be a problem? Hello? - Um, yes. No problem. We can do that. - [Sharon] Oh, also, did you get the note about Mr. Clarence being highly allergic to oregano? - Oh, sure. We've got a note right here. - [Sharon] Perfect. See you tomorrow. - What were you thinking? We can't pull together a tasting this big by tomorrow. - We've got to. This week's orders just arrived. We've got everything we need. - I haven't prepped the staff and what about the linens? I still have to take it to the cleaners. - Nothing we can't handle. We totally got this. [upbeat music] - We do? So we have to do something selfless to get out of this mess. - I can help Dad run lines. - And I can walk Olivia through how to prepare for the menu tasting. - I can't teach decades of cooking in an hour while trying to remember lines. - Priority is menu tasting. - Of course. - This little play of yours doesn't pay for the house. So excuse me for putting a priority on things that truly matter. - We have everything we could want and you guys are still fighting. - I will not apologize for working hard to put food on this table. - We got a little more than food on the table, Mom. God forbid we have a little less but are actually there for each other. - I see. So you've been alive for a whole 16 years and you know everything. - Where were you when my team went to the finals? - And the time I got the lead in "Annie"? - Come on, guys. It's not so bad. [bright music] We just need to fix it. - Yeah Dad. Things will just magically fix itself. - Okay, so when making a roux the key is to have the pan over medium-low heat. - What's a roux? - So you're gonna want a round table for the menu tasting. Who cares what shape the table it is? - Why do you have to argue with everything I say? - I'm not arguing. - Yes you are. - No I'm not. - You've got to focus on who your character is, not just the words you're saying. - That makes no sense. - We're just trying to survive. So, chill on the advanced drama training. - Right. I forgot. You've yet to actually be on stage but you already know everything. Please, take the lead, oh all knowing drama king. - Don't get mad at me because I landed the lead on my first audition. - Understudy. - [Hunter] Jealous! - This isn't helping! Look, I just need to get through this and not look like a complete dweeb. - Dad! No one says dweeb anymore. - See what you did? - See what he's doing? - Shut up. - You shut up. - You shut up. - Shut your face up. - It's your fault. We're trying to help him. Shut up. - Shut all of this up. - Maybe with the salad, we do Dad's tomato oregano soup. - Hunter! Not oregano. - Basil. Then we'll do the-- - Sweet basil, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Sweet basil. Sweet basil. - Y'all are here early. - It's a big day. - What's so big about today? - The mayor's office called last night. They wanna do a menu tasting for his wedding reception. - Today? Okay. What do you need me to do? - Any thoughts on dessert? - I think we should do a chocolate souffle. Yes. Woo! [rhythmic drum music] - You're in my way. - I have a prosperation for you. - A proposition? - You're gonna wanna listen carefully. I saw the two of you together. - Alexis, just get to your point. Yeah, that's pretty scary. - You look a little too cozy. Now, I don't know what kind of weirdo freak you are, but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want this plastered all over the entire school. - You wouldn't dare. - Clearly, you don't know who I am. - Alexis! I'm shocked by this behavior. Young lady, you should know better. We do not judge people based on who they choose to love. Olivia, I'm so proud of you. Standing up for who you love. - No, this is not what it looks like. - You should be celebrated, not torn down. And Alexis, I will not tolerate this kind of hatred and bigotry in my drama department. You are no longer the lead. It's okay. My first wife was my seventh cousin. - We have got to get our kids out of this school. - Oh, look at all of you waiting so patiently. I have a couple of announcements before we get started today. First of all, Alexis has made some unfortunate life choices. So she will not be performing this weekend. Secondly, in her place, her understudy Sarah will be fulfilling that role. [students applauding] We're going to start today on scene 17. So if you would all please stand up. Very good, very quickly, very quickly. Okay, so we're going to begin with scene 17 but this time I want us to play it like wild African animals. You. Would love for you to be a graceful gazelle. Give us space. [students giggling] And you, a strong elephant. [imitates elephant trumpeting] [Hunter imitates elephant trumpeting] - No. Strength from your toes all the way up through your torso. [Hunter imitates elephant trumpeting] Very good. [students applauding] [upbeat music] - Mr. Clarence, what's up, man? - You must be the lovely bride. Congratulations. - Thank you for coming. Let me introduce my team. This is my wife, Karen. She's the brains behind the business. This is our daughter, Olivia, and our son, Hunter. Who, by the way, is an incredibly bright young man. Amazing future ahead of-- [Karen clears throat] And this is our sous chef, Macy. - Well, thank you for accommodating us today. I'm sure it was a bit of a hustle. - It was nothing we couldn't handle. - Please, won't you sit down? - So for our first course today we will be having garden fresh arugula topped with cinnamon crusted walnuts, sprinkled with cranberries and gross cheese. Goat cheese! - Goat. - Goat. - Cheese. Goat cheese. [upbeat music] - Well Michael, you put together a very nice meal. - Yes, everything was perfect. - So glad you liked it. [Mayor Clarence coughs] - I suppose my assistant Sharon can work out the [coughs] details. - Sweetheart, are you okay? I thought you said there was no oregano! Call an ambulance now! Oh my god. You just lost this account. - Macy, thank you so much for your work today. I think we need to work this out amongst ourselves. - You don't have to tell me twice. - What did you do? - We didn't do anything! - My recipes were very specific. - We followed your recipes. Macy checked everything. - You two have just cost us our business. - It's just one event. You'll get another one. - We've got nothing left! We're behind on all our payments! That event was our last chance. - We... We didn't know. - Of course you didn't 'cause you're too consumed in your world to see that life is bigger than high school. - [Olivia] That is not fair! - Wanna talk about fair? I've worked for years to build a life for you guys. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. You've worked for years? Did I not have any part of that? - Don't start this now. - Stop it! Look, we know why you guys are fighting so much. We know about Chelsea. - Know what about Chelsea? - Chelsea and Dad. - What? - What? Chelsea? She just appreciates me. - How did I not see this? - Because there was nothing to see. - No, now there's nothing to see! [somber music] - What are you doing? - I was gonna pack my stuff but I'm not the one who should leave. You are. But then I couldn't decide if I should pack your stuff or Hunter's stuff. How did this get so screwed up? - I'm not the only one at fault here. - And what have I done wrong? - Bulldozing over everyone constantly. - At least I take initiative. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be cooking in that ratty little steakhouse. - I was happy in that ratty little steakhouse. - I pushed you to what I knew you could achieve. - Look where that got us. - It got us a beautiful home and a successful life. - Yeah, this is success. - Do you realize that I'm the one who takes the burden for this family? And do you know why? Because you won't! You continually force me to be the bad guy because you won't confront the kids or the employees. You're afraid to make any decisions. I thought I was giving you space to be yourself and now Chelsea! Really, Chelsea? - Nothing happened! - You know what? At this point, I don't even care. Do whatever you want. [somber music] [door slams] - I don't understand. We got rid of Chelsea. - That wasn't selfless. We did it because we don't wanna lose Mom and Dad. - What do we do now? - Everything's messed up. We'll never be able to change that. - Don't say that. - Look, even if we were to change back tonight it wouldn't really matter. I mean, their marriage is dead. The restaurant is done. [knocking on door] - You're not sleeping? Come with me. - What's going on? - I know this is awful for you guys. I'm sure we'll get switched back. We just have to keep working at it. - What about you and Dad? - I don't expect you to understand. But even if we do split up, I know we'll all be okay. - How can you say that? - You're both strong. You're almost out on your own anyway. - Those are excuses parents give when they feel guilty. - That was uncalled for. - What's uncalled for is having to destroy this family. - Because you and Dad cannot figure out a way to get along. You take us to church every Sunday and now this? Do you believe any of it? Mom? We're not gonna be okay. - I'll be a little later today. [knocking on door] - Hey. Come on in. Shouldn't you be in school? - I'm Michael, remember? - This thing is sure unusual. - Yeah. Got a few minutes? - Have a seat. So, what's going on? [gentle music] - I just don't know how we got here. - [Pastor Drew] Switching places? - Well, that too. It's like I suddenly woke up and my whole family's just broken. - We notice it suddenly but it's rarely sudden. It's usually a combination of little choices we make to ignore the important things. - It feels impossible. - It's fixed the way it was broken. One choice at a time. For some, it's making the decision to express your frustrations instead of staying quiet. For others, it's staying quiet in a moment of anger. - I'm afraid that we're a little too far gone for that. - Look, God has a way of taking our messes and making them his masterpieces. - But what about all the other couples in church? Their marriages failed. They're not masterpieces. - That's their past. Their forgiven past. I know your family. You guys can still turn this around. - Glad to see you made it. - It's time I was the responsible one. - Speaking of being responsible, I'd feel awful if we mess this up for them. - I agree. Listen, I know that it's my job to earn your trust and I know that it's my job to let you know that you're the only one for me. And you have to believe me that nothing happened with Chelsea. I love you very much and nothing is ever going to change that. - I know I can be a little controlling. - A little? - Don't push it. Maybe we could rehearse together? - You mean grow up and learn to get along. - Why does everyone think I sound like that? - It's because you sound like that. All right. What scene are you on? - I just can't remember these lines. - [Michael] Oh, that's easy. All right, here's how I do it. All right, so pretty much. - I just don't get how this happened. - What? - The whole oregano thing. I know for sure I didn't do it. - [Olivia] Are you saying I did it? - I didn't say that. But if you're feeling so guilty about it. - You're so dumb. - Wait. The security cameras. [Olivia gasps] - It's Chelsea. We gotta tell the mayor. - He's doing a ribbon cutting a block away. Hey, dork. You coming? [upbeat music] - Even though Avery and I have been very busy with our wedding and the upcoming election, it was very important for both of us to be here. So it's with deep pride and great honor that I officially open the Grand Imperial Hotel. Three, two, one! [crowd cheers] [crowd applauding] - Excuse me, mister esteemed mayor, could we have a moment of your time? - Oh, Mr. Reynolds. How are you doing? - I'm doing great, sir. How are you? - A lot better than the last time you saw me. - James, you almost died. I don't think it's something to joke about. - We were sabotaged. - We actually fired the girl who put the oregano in your soup. We are so sorry. - James, I am not going to risk our wedding reception at a place that would allow something like this to happen to you. - But it wasn't our fault. - When you're the boss, everything's your fault. Hi, I didn't know you were here. - Sorry guys. Actually, I have a business chamber meeting and we're in quite a pinch. We're looking for a new place to have it this week. - You can use our place anytime. - It's 100 people and if it works out, it'll be a weekly thing. Think you can handle that? - Definitely! - Great. It's this Friday night. - Oh. I'm sorry, but our kids have an important play at school on Friday night. - No, it's okay. I'm sure they'll understand. - Okay, I'll have my secretary call. [upbeat music] - Mom, Dad! - We did it. We fixed it. - We got the contract back. - Well, not the contract but something better. Something long term starting this Friday. - That's amazing. - Friday's the opening night of the play. - We're not gonna let you guys give this up. It's been our mistakes that sank our business, it's not just one event. - Yep. But we got a plan. - Come on. Bring it in, come on, come on. [upbeat music] - [Michael] Okay. - Macy. How long have you worked with us? - Five years. - Five years. I think it's time you plan your own event menu. - You never let anyone plan an event menu. - Karen and I will be here to help you prep but you should totally plan this one. - Okay people, every second counts. John, how much longer on the shrimp? All right, great. Citrus leaves. That looks good. Delilah, go back and get that steak. We need that ASAP. All right, great job, everybody. I think we're gonna make it. - This looks awesome, Macy. - Thank you. - And you're gonna be amazing tonight. - We're all gonna be amazing tonight. - We won't be here. - And where will you be? - Saving our parents from disaster. - Mic up, kids. Almost showtime. - Why me? - Oh, you don't know? Sarah got the mono. You're the lead, Hun. - Mono? Isn't that what Brian had? - No, no, no. I can't do this. - Hurry up. You're up in 10. [students chattering] - Gabbie. Psst, Gabbie. - [Gabbie] Oh, hi Mrs. Reynolds. The show's about to start. You gotta be quiet, okay? - Celia, dear. There's no need to call me. I am already home. I'm sorry that I couldn't make it to Megan's party. - It was her birthday, Peter. - I know, I know. And you know how these things are. Running for mayor is a big responsibility. - Your family is a big responsibility too. - Mr. Sinclair did what? Here, hold this. - Celia. Celia! - What are you doing here? - Saving you. - What about the mayor's event? - Macy's got it. Here, you need to take one of these. And you just in case. Olivia is gonna feed you the lines. Break a leg. - Now you want me to break a leg. [gentle music] - Cross over to downstage left. Walk towards the audience. Now say long day? - Long day? - Very. - Don't worry, you'll figure something out. Then cross back to stage right. - Don't worry, you'll figure something out. Then cross back to stage right. - Someone very dear to me recently reminded me that it's never too late to do the right thing. And what I commit today is to change. [audience applauding] [audience cheering] - I was so wrong. I don't know how you do it. That was so hard and you just go out there and shine. I'm so impressed. - Thank you. - I'm so proud of you both. You were awesome. - Thanks, bud. Couldn't have done it without you. [tense music] - [All] Thank you for us. - No way! - Yes! - We're back! - We did it. - Hey. Good job you two. Or was it you two? - It was all them. But we're back. - Pastor, we're right where we're supposed to be. - That's good to hear. Come on.
