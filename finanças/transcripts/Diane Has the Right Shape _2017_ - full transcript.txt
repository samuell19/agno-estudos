Watch this. Jimmy Connors! Come here! Jimmy Connors is actually American, not Irish, you know. Oh really? Are you sure he's not Irish? Oh my god, I'm so stupid. You know I'm such a stupid girl. But you're clever, I can see it. Yes, you are. It shows. Why do you put your hand here when you laugh? Sorry? Why do you do that? Yes, you have your... You still wear braces? Oh, I get it. You have shit teeth. You should use both hands in fact. You don't have dentists in Belfast? Is that why? You should get... How do you say "health insurance"? Jimmy! Wait! I can kiss you without thinking of your teeth. Really. I can separate my mouth from my brain. We'll check the crown-rump length. That means its size from here to here. The length is... 60 mm. Six centimeters. It that normal? Isn't it small? For a 12-week fetus, it's normal. It's not big, we're in the lower range. A midget like you. You idiot. If you want, I can tell you the sex with a 70% accuracy rate. No, we want to wait for its birth. Actually, I think I'd like to know. I mean, would you mind? No. But I thought we agreed? Yes, but... It's up to you guys. I don't mind. Whatever makes you happy. I'm sorry, but we really don't want to know. Okay. Let's carry on. Lie back down, please. The next ultrasound will be between June 6 and 20. What days are you free? Jacques, for the next ultrasound... when do you get back? Excuse me... Come here a sec. Here, hide this. I don't want Thomas to know. What is it? A song my mother used to sing to me. If you listen to it, maybe he'll get used to it. He or she. He didn't want me to bother you with this. Thank you. DIANE HAS THE RIGHT SHAPE He's bonkers. Mom? Hang on. Can you tell Dad that... Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Can you send me the number of those idiots who repaired the roof? Dad must have the bill. Hello? Shit, what a pain. Ouch! Shit! Excuse me. Sorry. No, it's nothing. I just walked on... - On? - Fabrizio. Yeah, Fabrizio. The electrician. He started today. I had the gas turned on too. For the contract, I can fake Dad's signature, but I need your bank details. Hello? I can't hear a thing. It's too annoying, I'll call you back. Did you see sawdust falling down from the beams? I didn't pay attention. You have beetles? Yeah, out on the terrace. I had sawdust falling on my face all fucking morning. Hey, I like the music. Who is it? An Austrian group. But they sing in French. - Are you Austrian? - No way. But I lived with an Austrian girl. So how are Austrian babes? I'll make coffee. Want some? Sure, thanks. The gynecologist is a friend of Jacques' parents. No, I don't realize. It doesn't look like much yet. Yeah, right. Morning sickness, yes. And I'm tired. Damn right. Here we go. Stop comparing... I don't want to hear about your pregnancy. There's no comparison... I'll be back tomorrow around 11. You should have electricity in your room. Great! Thanks. Bye! Stupid fucking forest. third month Sure it's not a load-bearing wall? The beam looks like it's sagging. Calm down. It doesn't bear anything at all. This part of the house was added on. - What's wrong? - I dislocated my shoulder. Holy shit! You okay? I have to put ice on it. - Here. - That's sweet. Thanks. That's pretty impressive. Especially the first time. You don't move at all? No, you don't move. Not at all. It relieves the pain. You know, in Chinese medicine... they say that arthritis is due to weak energy circulation. - Do you go there often? - Yes. I mean, I used to. I used to go often. I don't have time anymore. You went just for your whatchamacallit thing? - It's called "Yi Quan." - Sorry. My master is in Peking. Can you break this? - Yes. - How cool. Go ahead. - No, not here. - C'mon, please. Real quick. It doesn't work like that. C'mon, shit! Too bad. Not even a baby brick? Real fast, with your nose. No. But I can rebuild your wall if you want. Thank you, Mr. Expert, it's cool. I'll manage. How about inviting you for dinner? Can I do that? Let me think a minute. You the owner? It was my grandparent's place. It's nice. - The grounds are nice too. - But we can't sell it. Oh yeah? You shouldn't sell a place like this. It's too expensive for my parents. - You don't want it for yourself? - No way. I'm just passing through. Just long enough to fix it up. Turn around. What are you going to do? Some Chi Quan behind my back? Relax. Let your arms drop. That's it. What are you doing? Hmm... that feels nice. Oh yeah, that's good. It feels... - That was quick! - Sorry. I thought you'd at least finish your beer. Come here. Yeah, that's nice. Stop! No, stop! Stop, I'm too excited. You have fantastic breasts. They're fake. Go on, light your cigarette. Let me have a hit. - I'm trying to stop. - Oh yeah? My sister stopped with hypnosis. It worked? Yeah. But she put on 22 pounds. Now she wants to go back to lose weight. What do you do, besides fixing up houses? Oh, let's see... I went to lion-taming school. But I didn't graduate, I fell out with my big cat teacher. You're putting me on. Yep. I work in a bar. I'm a waitress. That's funny. I imagined you as something else. Oh yeah? Like what? I don't know, something more specific. No. I'm never specific. Your energy feels ambitious. Feeling people's karma is your thing? No, I just didn't picture you as a cocktail waitress. Nope. So. You feeling less excited now? Want to start where we left off? In fact, it's more like yoga. Because... you can't fight if it's that slow. Can you? Or else you need a guy who wants to fight in slow motion. If I attacked you... Watch out! - What would you do? - You want to attack me? - There you go. - Stop it. I'll fall. - You'll get hurt. - Go on. Let's see your tummy muscles. - No, stop it. - C'mon, let's see. I'm pregnant! Already? I'm serious. I'm three months pregnant. You're kidding, right? No, I swear. I'm really pregnant. - You got a boyfriend? - No. - And? - And nothing. I don't want to talk about it. I don't have to justify myself. Oh, I do? You don't have to get aggressive. - I'm not. - Yeah, I'd say you are. Okay, I got it. - I'll get back to work. - Yeah, go ahead. I'll try to finish up today. Fucking pain. This is how you make cement. You're going to need sand, water and cement mix. Take some mix with a trowel. The trowel will prevent skin burn from the cement. So, it's better to use a tool. We know that. Let's get down to the cement. Ouch! Get back in, goddammit! Don't worry, you'll be fine. The morphine will take effect soon. There you go. I need to ask a few questions. Are you taking any treatments? Any allergies? Stay with me. Any allergies or treatments? I take... metoclopramide. Please, listen to me. Are you pregnant? This is like wow. Focus... - I'm in heaven. - This is important. We need to know. Is it for morning sickness? You absolutely must tell your colleague... that his pants are way too tight. Miss... Are you pregnant or not? Okay, yes. A tiny bit. It's cool. - You're pregnant? - A little bit. Call headquarters. Ask them about nalbuphine. I injected 0.4 mg. - You should've asked before. - She could've told us herself. What's going on? You could've told us you were pregnant. Headquarters? The heart rate is 156 bpm and calm. If you suffered, the baby didn't feel a thing. You're sure? - Do you know its sex? - No. I can tell you... No, that's okay. Did it move or was that the image? No, it moved. Okay. Rest assured, everything's fine. Excuse me, I'll be right back. "I let myself in, you left everything open? Good luck, Fabrizio" Hello, this is Fabrizio's voicemail, please leave a message. It's Diane. I saw the kitchen. Thanks. Even if I could've done it myself. I owe you lunch. I'm kind of stuck here. I had a small accident, nothing serious. So, if you feel like dropping by... I'd be happy to see you. Take care. Your longest one was 7 years? No, my longest was 8 years. From 16 to 24. How cute. You didn't have a childhood sweetheart? Of course I did. From 6 to 6 1/2. His name is Thomas. He's like a brother now. But when I was a kid, I was super in love with him. We lived in the same development. - I grew up in a development too. - Oh yeah? - Want me to drop you off? - No, I think I'll walk. Okay then. Unless you want to stay over tonight. We could watch a movie. I can't tonight. I have to see Ebba. The Austrian? Yeah. But I'm not looking forward to it. It's for some stupid administrative papers. I could come tomorrow. Tomorrow's another day. We'll see. You know, the child I'm carrying. It's not for me. It's for friends who can't have one. There. Now you know. Fuck. It's been gray ever since we got here. It's kind of like Le Havre. Tokyo, Le Havre, same shit. And the Japs dig baroque music? Yeah, they're into it. We don't have time for anything. We play and we leave. Tomorrow morning we're off to... - Where do we play tomorrow? - Sendai. Sendai. I don't know where it is. To be honest, I'd rather be with you. I can't focus. Jacques, can you tell him to stop making that face? C'mon, enjoy yourself. In 6 months, the good times are over. - You're right. - I tell him non-stop! What? Can you... show... belly? Please? The connection's shit. It's cutting out, I can't see anything. - Thomas? - ...can't see... Thomas! Ouch. Diane! Diane? Are you okay? You scared me. Why's the music so loud? What're you doing here? I thought you wanted us to get together. You have a nice evening? You get laid? No, but it was nice. We're both much calmer. It helped to talk. I really don't get that. Keeping the ex's around. How cowardly. I don't get it, it's like warmed-up leftovers. It's pathetic. It's totally... it's bullshit, it's cowardly... When it's over it's over. Got to cut ties. Whatever. If you say so. Well, I guess I'll get going. No, don't. Don't go. No, come here. Isn't that the same song? You have a musical ear. It doesn't bother you? I can separate my head from my belly. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - So which part do I make love to? - Stop thinking. And stop asking me questions. Good. fourth month Ready? Good. That's good. Ready? I knew it. I knew it! I knew it. This is Montel for Stan. Aisle No. 5. Bathroom appliances and faucets. I'm with a couple who are looking for a tall salesman with blond curly hair. Okay. Nope, no tall curly-haired blonds working here. Stop messing with me. I talked to him right here one week ago. Then it's Frantz. But he has a real thick German accent. - You see my wife is pregnant, right? - Yes. We can't come back every week until you decide to take down the damn model shower I reserved. You shouldn't treat people like idiots. I'm sorry, folks... we never reserve showroom models. We just don't. We'll go see your manager together and explain the situation and I walk out of here with the shower. Don't be aggressive. I'm not aggressive. - It's about having trust. - I'm not. Get Marc and Mounir. I'm coming with a client. Call the SWAT while you're at it. Hello? Yes, I heard. I didn't have time to answer. When do you land on Thursday? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. There's no emergency. Why don't you rest up first? Okay! Relax! I was only saying that for you. I don't care. Come straight over. Yes, yes. Everything's fine. I promise. Everything's fine. We'll call each other later. Say hi to Jacques. Fabrizio? Your attention please... little Fabrizio's mommy is waiting for him at the front desk. Are you crazy? I never said it was a kid. What the fuck? I'm sorry, ma'am. It's "miss." Sorry. Can you do it again? Okay. I'll wait until she wakes up. - Go make her some coffee. - It makes her sick. Then what does she drink? Sorry. Thomas. When did you get here? Around 10:30. I sleep a lot. Yes, I know. I'm not very awake to welcome you. We don't care. You can spend the night. I made up the guest room. I repainted it. - The bathroom too. - I know, Lorenzo showed us. Fabrizio. - You met? - Yes. Jacques finds him very handsome. He even wants to start learning... He told you about that? Why did he do that? I hope you want to walk around looking like a geisha. Oh, great. It's super pretty. For your parents I got some geta thongs. You can give them to someone else. - You won't see them here. - I won't? They're always complaining I do nothing with my life, and when I do, they don't give a shit. - They said that? - They don't want to see me pregnant. They're afraid it'll upset them or some bullshit. But it's okay. Hey, we don't care. We don't need them. What does Jackie Chan think of you being pregnant? He's here, right? Did you tell him about your breasts? It'll be a shock when he discovers you don't have any. I take it back! What's that grip? You had enough? It moved. It just moved. Want to feel? Give me your hand. - I don't feel anything. -You don't? Right there. There. It did it again. To the right. You feel it now? It's super strong. Jacques! Can you help me tie the... Yeah... I should probably wear something underneath. No, stop. Come on, let's go join them. I haven't seen them in a long time. Hang on, how many of us are there? What're you talking about? Hang on. He does that with his... What's that noise? No way! Otamatone! That's so sweet! It's fab. Look at the face he's making. The most dissonant instrument in the world. Stop! He's so good. That's my big problem. I can't play an instrument. I would've loved to play something. He's amazing. You put anything in his hands and he makes music. No, don't! - We have to feed it. - Stop that. He hasn't eaten in 12 hours. While Thomas rummaged around Tokyoite music stores, I hung out in zoos, looking for... the poetry of nature. Here, look at this. Isn't he great? He's an adorable panda. And he eats bamboo all day long. - Where was that? - Hino. A suburb of Tokyo. It's one of the best zoos we ever saw. - He's funny. - Yeah, he sure is. You were lucky to see one. There are less and less of them. Pandas hardly reproduce. The males are lazy. They're surrounded by bamboo plants and they'd rather suck on them than reproduce. It's a real problem, because the females aren't very fertile by nature. It's a self-endangered species. They have to use artificial insemination to save them. I mean people. Not the pandas. I had... I had no idea. Did you know that? No, not at all. You didn't show him the bamboo forest? It's practically next door. It's super pretty. You'd think you were in China. Or somewhere like that. I can't believe you didn't show him. I don't know, I didn't think of it. I swear I didn't mean anything. It came up in the conversation. What did I say that was so wrong? "The males would rather suck than reproduce." Oh shit! Oh, yeah. C'mon, you're being paranoid. Yeah, right. - I swear I didn't mean anything. - Then what's so funny? - You're totally homophobic. - No, I'm not! I swear on my mother's life, it just came out. On my mother's... I swear it's true. - Which one did you sleep with? - Don't talk so loud. I didn't sleep with anyone. Stop being such a jerk! Calm down. Whose sperm is it? It's none of your business. What do you think you're doing? - Calm down. - You're so crass. Everything okay? It's too hot. And I was starving to death. Are you putting on a normal amount of weight? A little over. How long has that spaghetti been there? - Go back to bed. - I won't be able to fall asleep. Me either. - Want to watch a movie? - Sure. What? So... Fatal Games or True Romance? Pump Up the Volume. Pump Up the Volume? Okay, but the French version. - Of course. - The French version rocks. Cool. Have you seen Christian Slater recently? He looks awful. No, I haven't. I'm afraid to see. - I don't want to know. - Puppy dog. Christian Slater will never change. Oh, I'm sorry. - I didn't want to wake you up. - It's okay. - What time is it? - Very early. - You alright? - Yeah. When I woke up, he wasn't next to me. I wasn't in my bed or my bedroom. - I didn't know what was going on. - We watched a movie. Okay then. I'll go back to bed. Sleep well? Sort of. I didn't really sleep. I mean, I didn't sleep well. Want me to show you the bamboo forest? I was going to go running. - Maybe we could go after. - Sure. seventh month Shit. There we go. That's good. Here. I don't know why it's so heavy, it's not even real wood. The holes are below. On your side but not here. It'll be crooked. - You see? - You annoy me. Here's the wall I told you about. I'd like to put shelves here, but I'm afraid the plaster will crack. You can't put them there. Here you can. That would work too. Hello? Really? What's wrong? Is it Diane? No, we're done. What kind of pains? Let me talk to her. Let me talk to her! - Relax. - Fabrizio! You're white as a ghost. It was the car ride. It made me nauseous. Were you sitting down or standing up when it happened? I was... I was... I was in the house. It happened all of a sudden, like an electrical shock. I'm sure it's nothing. That's enough, you're moving in with us. We'll take good care of you. If you want to, we'd be super happy. Honestly. I don't know, guys. If anything happened, I'd die. Nothing will happen. We'll sleep on the couch and you can have the bedroom. - We'll bring your mattress... - We're doing it, end of story! You can come in. It took my breath away. It was low down and super intense. Don't worry, your pregnancy is perfect. There's nothing wrong. Your cervix is perfect for 7 months. - Will I need a cerclage? - No, not at all. What's that? We stitch the cervix to cinch it shut. My mother had one when she was pregnant with me. I was afraid it was transmissible. Not at all. Besides, it's a procedure we hardly ever use now. For premature dilation, we prescribe progesterone. What is the dilation due to? There are so many factors. The placenta can be too heavy or physical strain... - She does Kung Fu. - Really? You should stop that. No, I don't. - What do you do? - It's Yi Quan. It's much gentler. It's up to you to feel your limits. Excuse me for asking. Is making love advisable? It's not contraindicated. Are you kidding? I read that orgasms make you secrete hormones that can set off contractions. It's the love hormone, pyostacine. Oxytocin. It's only at the very end. At this stage, there's no reason. If I need this kind of information, I'll ask. - It's my business, right? - Can't I worry? Yeah, but this subject is... I'd rather you discuss this elsewhere. - Okay, it's taboo. - No, it's not taboo... - If we can't discuss it here... - It's for me to ask. - If we're worried, we should ask. - Can you stop! What made you decide to start a relationship right now with a guy no one knew from Adam three months ago - and who will be gone in two? - How do you know? You never stay with anyone. - Everything okay? - Yeah. Apparently it was just practice contractions. Can you leave us alone for a second? We need to talk. I'll be right there. We have a little thing to settle. - You're going too far.... - Going too far? His dick is going too far in your cervix! The idea is unbearable. - Excuse yourself. - You think the same. Excuse yourself right now. Otherwise I'll smack you. Hey, I'm kidding. Okay? I can talk like this with her. Can't we talk like this? Sure. Diane! Diane, come here! Okay, I'm coming! Come here, you fat whale. Oh my god! Not bad, huh? You rock! You totally rock! Hurry, I can't take the heat anymore. I'm making sure it's not too cold. Oh, yeah. You didn't tell me Thomas came by. I forgot. You were sleeping and then I forgot. What do you mean? When was I sleeping? You told him to leave? I said that he gave you contractions. Are you crazy? You didn't say that, did you? That's not funny, shit. When were you going to tell me you're moving? One, it's none of your business. And two... I haven't made my mind up yet. What did you really tell him? He's clueless. He'll have an anxiety attack. So what? A little anxiety won't kill him. They want all the advantages and none of the hassle. - "Hello, we'd like a baby." - "Sure, come back in 9 months." "Thank you, Mrs. Stork. What's the bill?" "No, it's all on me." That's exactly the way I want it. You think you'll give it up so easily? With a snap of the finger? What are you talking about? Why not? I've never wanted a child. I don't have it in me. And I never will. Really? You really believe that? Yes, really. - So you hate being pregnant? - No. I mean... You regret it. That's got nothing to do with it! Being pregnant and having a child isn't the same! How would you know? I know because I'm doing it. - And I don't believe you. - I don't give a shit what you think! Not a fucking shit! Think what you like! It doesn't interest me. Go smoke somewhere else. Where are you going? Stop. Please stop. I would tell you if there was a problem. eighth month Think of something you don't like. A dish or a beverage you hate. You're going to put it in a box. And you'll put your cigarettes in the box with it. Now you dig a hole and put the box in the hole. No, but... - Try to relax. - I'm very relaxed. You're wasting your time, I'm wasting mine. We'll stop here. No, no, no! - I'll stop! - No, I don't think so. I will, hang on. Give me one more chance. I have other patients waiting. Let's go. - No, I'm begging you! - There are other ways to stop smoking. You can't leave me like this. You have to help me. Okay, then... - We'll try one last time. - It'll be fine. One time. Thanks. - I can't guarantee the outcome. - It's going to work. In my opinion, you're not receptive. We're going to try something different. I'll sit next to you. Let's go. Relax. Breathe calmly. - Is it true you can lose weight? - No. No? - That's what I heard. - Not at all. I work with addictions. And food can be an addiction. So indirectly, yes. How does it work? I reprogram your psyche. - Oh, wow. - Yes. And... Can you modify anything you want in a psyche? No, not everything. Certain things. For example... can you make emotional attachment disappear between two people? Between a man and a woman... or a mother and her child? We're not magicians. We work on fears, on phobias, on addictions. That's all. - That's already a lot. - Yes. Ready? Look at my finger. Follow it. Your body is unwinding. Your muscles are relaxing. You're getting heavier. Heavier still. You're going to let go. You're going to let go... now. Miss... Wake up! I think your waters have broken. Miss... Miss... - Your waters have broken. - What? It's impossible! It's in one month! This is too early! I'm not finished! I think you need to get going now. Thank you. Are you alright? Oh shit, it's sopping wet. Give me your phone. Here. - Shit, what did you do to me? - What did I do? I didn't do anything. It's not my fault. Thomas? Fuck, what's the number? What? I had a contraction. Okay, we don't want you giving birth here. I'll take you to the clinic. No, wait! Type "Cheap-Electrician-Lussens." What? Come on! "Cheap-Electrician-Lussens"! What for? No, please don't. That's leather. You better hurry. You've got nerve. Turn back as soon as possible. I can't, idiot! - Turn right. - I can't! I don't believe it. C'mon guys. Bastards can't do anything else? Oh, wow. I can feel that. Turn back as soon as possible. Sir, the lady's pregnant! Can you write this down: 06-80-70... I only have two hands! I can't drive and write at the same time. You're right. Sorry, focus on the road. - Give me your phone. - It can't wait one minute? Fabrizio, give me your phone! I have to call them. I don't know where it is, goddammit! There's no time for an epidural. The baby's coming. - It's time to go. - You're kidding, right? You're fully dilated. The baby's coming. No, I don't want to! I don't want to. Not yet! I promise you can do it. Come on. I'm begging you, get Jacques and Thomas. I'll go after, I promise. A contraction is coming... let's go. - No, no. - It's time to go. Take a breath. Come on, your baby needs you. Push hard where it hurts, okay? The quicker you do it, the quicker it's over. Let's go! The tree posture. It'll help you. Get mad! Push harder, harder. That's great. Just a little more. Shit, get them! That's fantastic! Great. Yes! There we go. Is the contraction over? Breathe slowly, very slowly. There we go, that's good. Come here. You can come over, sir. Come on. I swear, if you don't go get them... I'll stop pushing. I'm here. You have to get them. It's time to go again. It's coming. Come on, I need you. You have to push much harder. Think of your baby, it's almost here. No, no, no! Shit! Why did I do this to myself? I'm an idiot, right? Yes, I'm an idiot! No, you're not. Don't say things like that. I'm going to die. I swear, I'm going to die. You're doing great. No, it's not great. I'm not doing anything! Shit! You're doing good. Carry on like that, it's perfect. Come on, let's go. That's perfect. Come on, push hard. Go on, for fuck's sake. Go get them. Leave! I'm begging you, go get them now. Make him go! He has no business here! He's not the father. Get him out of here! Come with me. You're not helping her. Get out. Get out. Hello there! Welcome. Your daughter's doing just fine. She came early, so she's teeny. But she's doing fine. Is it normal that she's not crying? Yes, don't worry. There we go. Can I sleep a bit? - Would you like me to take her? - Yes, please. Thank you. Good evening. It's time for your baby's bottle. Don't forget to note how much she drinks. - Call if you need me. - Okay. You're going too fast. That's it. Hello, this is Fabrizio's voicemail, please leave a message. Did Fabrizio say he was coming back? No, I don't think so. Did he say anything? Excuse me, can I bum a cigarette? Thanks. I don't have... Sorry. Thanks, I really appreciate it. Sorry. ninth month Nighttime bath. Who is it? Let me see! It's Hannah. You spell it H-A-N-N-H-A. No. Like Anna with two "H's." One on each end. You think it's pretty? Yes. But who is it? He didn't even know a woman's waters broke. He thought his wife spilt a glass of water! You gave birth 3 weeks ago and you look like Claudia Cardinale! My sister... you couldn't get any skinnier than her. Now she has a butt like a hippopotamus. I don't hear anything. Sure, she's awake. Let's go, this is a bad idea. No way! You're a pain. - Surprise! - Hi. Sorry to drop by so late. We don't sleep anymore anyhow. I told her about Hannah. Hi, Amelie. - Come on in. - You bet! She's a cutie. I can't believe it. What's going on? We were in the neighborhood... You remember Amelie? Hey, how are you? Bravo! Daddy! Hey sweetie. What's wrong with you tonight? All those tears. Can I hold her? Did you wash your hands? There's some disinfectant gel in the bathroom. Shit. What's going on now? I better go, he's having trouble with the bottle. Okay, I guess I'll go wash my hands with their hand stuff. Hello there. You've got a cool bedroom. Your daddies are the best. They take this real serious. But they're serious guys. I'm not a serious girl. If I were, you wouldn't be here. You think you'll remember you were inside me? It doesn't matter, my love. No, no. We're leaving. We're out of here. Hey guys, we're leaving. Okay. - Sorry for stopping by this late. - Don't be. - Fabrizio dropped by two days ago. - Oh yeah? He wanted to see the baby and give her a present. He got her the big stuffed tiger. - Did you see it? - Yeah. And what did he say? Not much. We made small talk about the baby, then he left. Who's Fabrizio? He's... no one. I'll go see what she needs. - See you around. - Yeah. We didn't know if we should tell you or not. Don't worry, guys. It's no big deal. I've moved on. And besides... it's much better this way. Any song I try, it never works. He gets it right each time. Wow. See you. Thanks for coming. Of course. - Ciao. - See you soon. Hello, this is Fabrizio's voicemail, please leave a message. Hey Fabrizio, it's me, Diane. I don't understand why you never called me back. I saw your tiger... for Hannah and... it's big. You know, you left lots of stuff at my place. There's two shirts, two toolboxes... and some smelly T-shirts. I don't know... sorry... swallow your stupid pride and let's get together. You can pick up your stuff and we can talk too. Okay, bye. Hello? Yeah, what? I don't know, you called. I don't know, what do you want? Yeah. It's good to hear your voice, you moron. You big dummy. Sous-titrage TITRAFILM
