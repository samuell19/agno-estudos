In 2003, the BROTHERHOOD, a secret spy agency, stopped The Man and his racist organization from bringing down black America. After blowing up The Man's headquarters and sending him into hiding, I returned to the hood for some hard-earned R and R. And R and B. That's me, Undercover Brother.

Vienna, Austria. Just as I suspected. Oh, word. Yo, man, our first mission together. Yo, when do we leave? Lionel... the BROTHERHOOD is on the frontline on the fight for civil rights up against the world's greatest forces of evil. This ain't no middle school dance-off. Yes, The Man. He was one cold mother. And like herpes, he always came back. Once we defeat the blacks... we'll go after the other undesirables. Immigrants, feminists... homosexuals. Daddy! Daddy! Oh, Manson. How many times have I told you not to interrupt your father while he is scheming? Sorry. I just wanted to ask... What? Ice dancing costume. Chiffon? Or taffeta? I think they're both very nice. Thanks, Daddy! Oh, he's quite a boy. He's gonna make a fine racist one day. Hmm... well, where was I? Uh, you were talking about going after the homosexuals. Oh, yes. They're worse than the blacks. Almost. Well, it's time for my massage mit happy ending. I will see you all later at dinner. White tie, of course. The Man was masterminding his latest master plan, to spread evil everywhere, which meant one thing. It was time for a good old fashioned beat down, Undercover Brother style. Solid. And after dinner, a classic black and white movie. With the black turned off, of course. Gentlemen, there's some hot chocolate there. Help yourselves. Freeze, you suckers! Undercover Brother? How did you find me? Wasn't hard. Vienna has everything the conquer-happy white man loves the most. Skiing, mountain climbing, those little tiny sausages. You're forgetting the best thing of all. None of you people are here! Until now. I had The Man right where I wanted him. Until... Make that a double! Goddamn it Lionel, what the hell are you doing here? I'm here to help you. That's what you call it? Yeah, this is helping. Helping me? No, no! Your ass is supposed to back helping at the hood. What did I tell you? What did... Hold on. Is that hot chocolate I smell? It is hot chocolate I smell, man. Mm-mm. People that's wrong. That was white chocolate Wait, hold up. Is this your spot? Man, this is nice! The Man. Mh-hmm? Allow me to introduce my brother. Yes, yes, you're all brothers from another mother... No, no, man, I'm talking about the same uterus here. He's my actual brother. This is nasty... Surprise. Everything was funked up. But a super fly, super spy always comes prepared. Hyah! Oh! Now, can I get back to saving the world? Kill them! Hyah! Take that, sucker! Oh! Lionel! Meeting adjourned. Slow your roll, bro. Leave the catch phrases to the professionals. We got a leg up on them suckers. Yeah. Let's get The Man. Yeah. The Man could run... but it looks like he could hide even better. Man, where'd he go? Split! Quick, hold your breath! Sixteen long years passed. Black America was dealing with some ups and some downs. It was up to the new agents of the BROTHERHOOD to monitor it all. Chief Honey? Yes? On the screen. Street fights in Seattle, unrest in Vermont. What is going on with white people? See, it's times like this when we really miss Undercover Brother the most. What's going on now? This just came in. What? Yes, we'd been frozen all those years, like a couple of veal cutlets forgotten in the back of the freezer. I'm here for Undercover Brother. How is he? Oh, ja. Still in the coma, I am afraid. Could be, weeks, months... uh, seasons, fiscal quarters, leap years. Okay. Actually it is a miracle they both survive. Both? What's up, my man? Mm... Hello, mama. Yo, where am I? Schladming Hospital, Austria. You were buried in the avalanche. Yo, what day is it? February 9th. I was buried for an entire week? 2019. An entire week and 16 years? Ja, it was only due to global warming that we found you. Right on, global warming. Do you remember anything that happened? Yeah, um, I was on a mission with my brother. So Undercover Brother is your brother? We were on the trails of The Man and we had him captured. Yo... where's my brother? Why? Gah! At least the fro's still good. Where's The Man? Well, we believe he fled and went back to America after the avalanche. Look... you gotta let me into the BROTHERHOOD, all right? I gotta be the one to avenge my brother. What qualifications do you have? I held up two years of karate as a kid and I held up my own dance crew. Not gonna work. And I can kiss a woman temporarily stupid. I would love to see you do that. Oh, yeah. Whoa... Welcome to the BROTHERHOOD. No, Snoop, you can't borrow my car. Frãulein! Frãulein... I will avenge you... my brother. Oh, no. Oh, man. Barber shop? I guess I could use a little trim. The usual. Couldn't we all, my brother? I love you, Oprah. I love you, Madonna. I love you, oh, Lord. It's the water, I swear. Okay. I swear. That's fine. Uh-huh. You gonna leave me like this? Hey, how you doing? You looking fine. Welcome back. - Damn... - Some crazy-ass shit was about to rain down and I hope my bro brought his umbrella. Damn. This is crazy. Okay. What? Yo, you serious? Undercover Brother's brother, meet Harvard Brother. Tu mihi magna voluptas est ad receperint. Meet Sarcastic Brother. Biggie or Tupac? Biggie! Well... well, Pac. I don't trust him, he work for the feds. Get him outta here. Huh? This is Unattainable Sistah. Don't even think about it. And lastly, meet Militant Brother. Power to the people, my brother in the revolution. Um, can I rap to you for a second, Chief? Yes, yes. Have you noticed that that's a white dude and he heavily armed? Militant Brother identifies with being African-American. Okay. And I identify as Denzel Washington but that don't make it so. You done? A lot has happened since you were frozen. Did you know America twice elected a black man, Barack Obama, president? Next thing you gonna tell me Michael Jackson's the vice president, Prince is secretary of state and Whitney Houston's his first lady, right? Uh, no. Actually, Michael, Whitney, and Prince are all... dead. What? Are all dead. So, you mean to tell me that the president of the United States of America is a black dude named Barack Obama? Sadly, that time has passed. The current president is Donald Trump. Y'all messing with me, right? Okay, enough. Enough. Covert operations show a plot underway to subvert American democracy. The Man. We don't know. Haven't heard from him in two years. You are one of the few that has seen his face, so we're counting on you to help us find him. This phone is equipped with text encryption and a secure line. This is a phone? This is dope! Yo, what about Tetris? Man, gonna catch an eye jammy. Okay. Go sell your bean pies. Thank you. Listen, you will be notified within 24 hours of your mission. Until then, lay low. Avoid all attention. Avoid all attention. I got this, Chief, a'ight? 'Cause I'm going undercover. Ah! 'Bout to save my brother. Ah, ah. Going undercover, ah, ah. 'Bout to save my brother. Oh, yeah. Really? Great hire, Chief. I know. Everybody back to work! Lionel returned to the hood, only to discover much had changed in the last 16 years. He was a stranger in an even stranger land. What happened to the hood? Gone were the brothers and sisters and a lame-ass coffee house called Resistance Brews stood in the place of the funk-alicious Club Hood. Replaced by millennials, post-millennials, and worst of all, hipsters. Something funny? No, no offense, non-brother, but I ain't never seen no clothes like this before and what's up with the hairdo? Listen, I'ma need a moment okay? I'ma need a moment, I'ma need a moment. Nope, I'ma still need more time. Hey, man, let me ask you something. What you feeding that thing? Whatever, dude. Mmm, I see the hood may have gone but they still got a few brick houses up in here! Mmm! What did you say? Oh, nothing, I was just talking... You were just objectifying a woman based on her looks. While equating her with a piece of property? I don't know what y'all two talking about. Oh, you didn't mean to diminish her self-worth and intellect? By suggesting she was something you could just buy, move into and renovate to your liking? I didn't say nothing like that... So she fits your cisnormative criteria of beauty is that it? As if all women were just put on display for your personal oppression. Your personal oppression. Oh, mama. And now you impose the exploitative role of childbearer on her? Yes, why "Oh, mama," and not "Oh, industrial engineer," or "Oh, president of the United States"? You are a pig. Wait, wait, wait. Why is it okay to call me... Uh-uh! Don't mansplain to us. Is that all we are to you? Pieces of meat to be lectured? Just 'cause we choose to wear short shorts... And occasionally shake our asses like this. Mmm... Look at him. Slack-jawed as if we were nothing more than incredibly hot, sex objects here for his mind-blowing pleasure. I swear, I mean no disrespect. Then why are you still staring? I can't seem to move my head! Make 'em stop! Make 'em stop! I'm just glad there's somebody here to capture your soul-crushing sexism. Soul-crushing. Mm, mm, mm. Disgusting sexist pig. Eight million views on YouTube. Chief, for the 800th time I am incredibly sorry. Stop. Look, guys, you have to believe me, all right? I was set up! Right. Someone just set up an intricate spy operation just to show that you a perv. Hey man, look. I ain't no perv, a'ight? I just like looking at fine booty. I feel you, my brother. Respect. Hmm? Don't do that. Look, guys, when did everybody get all sensitive anyway? And what is that supposed to mean? Listen, reports of similar incidents are up 600% in Caucasian communities. Chief, if most of these incidents involve whites why is the BROTHERHOOD getting involved? Experience has shown that whatever happens to our white brethren something worse is gonna happen to us. Plus, we always will be blamed in the long run. It's like you're speaking to my heart right now. Wait, hold on. There was an unverified... sighting of The Man at a local redneck bar. What would he be doing there? What would The Man be doing at a country and western bar? I don't know, trying to have sex with his sister? Let's go there and kill his ass! Count me in, brother! Locked and loaded! Chill! Calm down. Should we make contact? I'll make contact, all right. He is the only one of us who's seen The Man in person, Chief. Mh-hmm. He's got a point. Fine. Once you confirm that that is The Man, you withdraw and we will take it from there. Correct? Watch your dumb ass. What he said. Everybody, out of my office, please. Now. Especially you. Goodbye. How big was that ass, though? Bye. Comm-watch. Gives you instant access to all BROTHERHOOD intelligence. Cool. Hey yo, can it make me smarter? Hell, no. You will also need a combination camera and microphone. I've engineered a few options here. Yo, wait, wait. This is a camera and a microphone? Sure is, brother. Tight. Hey, wait, wait. What about these? Yep, those are, too. Now, listen up. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. What about this? That's a tape dispenser. What about... It's just a damn pencil sharpener! Put it down! Those are all desk-related items. The tech stuff is right here in the middle. Okay? You got the magnetic spy cam, you got the Bluetooth, the Kiss-Me-I'm-Irish lapel pin... What about this right here? Put that down! You all right? I think I'm just gonna take the pen and the watch and just... Ah! Get... I won't let you down, brother. Well, I sure as hell hope not. Not bad. Captures my inner funk. Undercover Brother! Man, you back? Well, not exactly. Damn! Dream on, brother. 'Cause this ain't never happening. Oh I knew it, man. You dead. You a ghost, ain't you? No, man, I'm not a ghost. I'm still in a coma in Austria. Wait, then how the hell did she just walk... Look, just go with it, okay? Okay. All right. All right? Think of me as your own personal Obi-Wan Kenobi, you dig? But he was a ghost too, when he appeared. Remember when we watched it? It was Yoda and all them... Damn it, Lionel. Shut up and listen, will you? Look. I came to tell you, you can do this. I believe in you. Yo, you really think so? Yeah. Man, thanks, bro. But, like... honestly, man, I don't even know where to start. Think of junk in the trunk. You mean Unattainable Sistah's booty? No, man, I'm talking about the trunk on my Cadillac, not... Even though she does have some packing for the smacking. Look, man, get your head out of the gutter and get on this. Okay. All right? Cadillac trunk. All right. Dig it? Trunk. Cadillac. Dig it. Bro? Hey, what's up, man? What's going on? Brotherhood. My beloved Cadillac. Me and her had some sweet rides. Man, if those white walls could talk. Got you. Sweet. ♪ Slow ride ♪ ♪ Take it easy ♪ ♪ Slow ride ♪ ♪ Take it easy ♪ ♪ Slow ride ♪ ♪ Take it easy ♪ ♪ Slow ride ♪ ♪ Take it easy... ♪ Testing, testing.

Not enough to take crap from an inbred mick bar jockey like you. I said bring me another. Kill him! Kill him! Sheesh. I could shoot the screen if you want. No. I said get out. We don't serve assholes like you. What, you just hire them? That's it! It's from Undercover Brother's brother. "Gurk eep gak"? Is that a text abbreviation? That I don't already know? Are you f'ing k'ing me? An encryption code? That's a butt text! I send 'em all the time. The Chief told me to withdraw. But I'm gonna stay and watch this. Come on! - Cheers. - Uno, dos, tres. Mazel tov. Damn. Help! My teeth! Mm-kay. Oh, I got you. Hey! Don't you think he had enough? Why don't you mind your own business, partner? Before we kick the cow shit out of you next. Okay, that's funny. Okay. Get funky, eh. Too funky for myself, uh. Hey, hey! You good? Come on, let's go. My teeth. Your teeth? Okay. Let's roll, my white brother. Thanks for saving me, cowboy. Don't mention it. It would have been nice if you had stepped in before they busted all my ribs. Well I thought you boys were just jostling around. You know how us white guys do. Oh, the... The hovel? Oh, okay, yeah. God, smells like... Very interesting. Brenda! I'm home! Brenda? Jesus. Nice to meet you, Brenda. That's my clean pair. Nice, uh... nice hovel. It's very... very roomy. Yeah, I try. I try. You know, not to brag, but I was once the head of a secret organization that ran the world. I was known as "The Man." Now I've heard rumors, but I didn't know you actually existed. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah? Yeah? Oh, yeah. Yeah! Oh, yeah? Oh-ho. I was at my peak. Yeah, I'd even... I'd even defeated my arch nemesis. Undercover Brother. Yeah, I saw that black bastard and his even blacker brother buried under a mountain of lily-white snow. Shut up! My downfall started with the elec... the election of President Obama. Right. The whole country... it changed overnight. And sexual harassment wasn't even allowed anymore! Our plot to control the darkly-hued by planting mind control drugs in fried chicken failed. But I have an even more sophisticated plan. Mind control through... menthol cigarettes and orange soda! Ha! It was my greatest plan. But my son, he had other plans. Greetings, all. Manson, how many times have I told you you cannot interrupt your father when he's working? Oh, it's no longer your work, Daddy. I'm terminated? This is my secret racist organization. Not since you incorporated for tax purposes. But I control the most shares! Not since Mommy gave me her proxy. I should never have divorced that woman. I should have had that screeching harpy killed instead! How could you do this to your own father? You only care about what divides us when all that really matters is the inevitable progressive arc of history. My own organization became "diversity this," "multi-culturalism that." Oh, dear God, the boy's gone full commie. Oh, I'm sorry, son. Just shoot him. Will you shoot him? All right, with pleasure. Okay, uh... All right, I get that I'm gonna die but can my executioner at least be white? Just feel a little more comfortable with that. Whoa, no offense, but my killer should be a man. You know, death is humiliating enough without it coming at the hands of une femme. Let this be my second to last request. You take the fun out of everything. If all you're going to do is complain, I won't even have you killed. Wait, I... Just go! Go, Daddy! Go! My own son. A scheming, treacherous backstabber. At least you're not gay. It's a damn shame. But that doesn't explain how you became such a urine-soaked, doll-humping, scab-infested asshole. Thanks for noticing. You're a very compassionate man. What's Manson and the organization up to now? I dunno, something about creating a virus that will trigger the collapse of Western civilization and lead to my son's ascension as leader of the unfree world. I don't know, we don't really talk anymore. Yeah, you want another shot, man? Oh, no, I'm fine, honestly, but uh... you're definitely gonna need it. Because I have a surprise for you! Solid. A negro! Yo, that's it? A negro? Don't you recognize me? Oh, you all look alike to me. I'm Undercover Brother's brother. Oh, that's impossible! I saw you both die. Well, you saw wrong. Oh... And I told you my life story. You see? This is why I don't trust ni... Reflex. It's been an hour since he sent that unreadable text. Send me in, Chief! I'll get in there thick as the oppression we experience as African-Americans every day. No! Let me see that phone. Burn, baby, burn. Any last words? Ugh. Chief, this is not a good time right now! You sent us a text, and we couldn't even read it. I've been trying to tell y'all my thumbs are too big for the keypad. You know what they say about men with big thumbs. Look, I already captured The Man and I interrogated him. - What? - Mh-hmm. And he also told me that his son, Manson, has taken over the organization and using some virus to end Western civilization. - Did you say the end of Western civilization? - Yes. Okay. This is what you need to do. Boy, you need to find that virus and you need to get The Man to help you. Well, he's not entirely cooperative right now. Figure it out. Get up, The Man. What's going on? We're going to catch a virus. Hookers. Not that type of virus. Look, you gonna help me find your son, Manson, and figure out what he's planning to do to end Western civilization. Oh, that. Why would I help you? Because it's the right thing to do! You gotta do better than that. Okay, how about take revenge on your son's betrayal and me not using your skull as a personal porta potty. Sold. Back in Austria, I was just coming out of my coma. Certain parts of me waking up before others, thanks to one fine looking frãulein. - Oh. - Mm, mm, mm. While at home, Lionel was forced to team up with The Man to uncover Manson's evil scheme. This is it. Our secret weapons lab. Whoa... Damn it. Man, we're too late. Your son is already using his new fronts for his operations. Oh, I have missed this place. You know, we were the first evil organization to have our own bioweapons lab. The demented jackals that raised you must have been so proud. Oh yes, they were. They were. "Woke"? Woke. That is the most dangerous drug. It changes you. Really? Show me. You expect me to take that? It could kill me. Then you'll save me the trouble. Now, take it. Not gonna... Give it to me. You good? How do you feel? I'm feeling good. Oh... Oh, I'm starting to care. About hoop earrings, cultural appropriation, endangered sea turtles. Oh... Now I can sense that my hatred for black people is diminishing. Come on, let me give you a big hug! Hell, no. Yeah. Don't touch me. Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Hands up, don't shoot! What the hell? Dang, Woke really works. Attica! Attica! Attica! Yo, I'm gonna have to take me a shot of this. ♪ Down by the riverside ♪ Flying high on Woke, Lionel and The Man booked a penthouse suite at the finest hotel in town.

Spending their time arguing about insignificant bullshit. ...oppressing men of color. Hey! Get a room! Get a room! Get a room! Get a room! Yo... Oh, man, my head hurts. How long have we been arguing? Three days. And that was just after one dose. Oh, oh wait. Excuse me, it's... Yo, Brenda! Where you at? One dose of Woke is like being socially conscious times 1000, turning normal liberalism into ultra-hyper-sensitivity. But what's in it for Manson? Mmm... Woke is wack. You gotta drink it, if you wanna think it! Pour one out for Whitney. We have nothing to lose but our minds! "White King Kong ain't got shit on me!" Come on guys, that's Training Day. Manson. I'll call the drywall guy. I have some news. Not bad news, is it? I really can't handle bad news right now. Hmm... Yeah, well. Daddy? Yeah. With a black man? That's impossible. I know. He is so racist. It may mean the BROTHERHOOD is on our trail. What is wrong with those people? I don't know. Why can't they just trust me to know what's best for them? You know what? Everybody out! Party's over! I need some me time! Me! Me! Manson was behind it all. Being amazing is so lonely. Running a nationwide Woke distribution system. Teach me to love again. And now the fool was strung out on Woke himself. The next step is figuring out where Manson is manufacturing the Woke. Undercover Brother's brother, this could mean the end of America as we know it. Look. Whenever I'm feeling lost, I always think to myself WWUBDMF. What's that? What Would Undercover Brother Do, Mutha... Shut your mouth. I'm talking about Undercover Brother. Oh. I can dig it. Dig that, yeah. Listen, great work with the interrogation of The Man. Thanks. Brought us right to his son. I think your brother would be very proud of you. You asked... Jesus! ...what would Undercover Brother do? I'd launch a full-scale investigation... on them titties. Boy, please, she would never go for a guy like me. No, now. No. Now, you listen to me. You right, you right. I ask you, where is the brotherhood? What're you talking about? It's eight blocks south... I'm not talking about the BROTHERHOOD. I'm talking about the brotherhood. Huh? Sense of community, fighting in this thing together. Back in the day, we didn't have much, but we did have each other's backs. Dude, I don't know what to tell you, man. The world's more divided now. Which is why we need to pull together now more than ever. I mean, do you got any advice on finding Manson? Follow the money. But, what does that mean, "follow the money"? Can you give me more... Hell if I know. Saw it in a movie one time. What movie? What are you talking about? I think it was Deep Throat. Deep Throat? Dude, this is not helping me at all! You're not helping. Well, fine. Don't follow the money, then. I don't give a rat's ass. Damn, can't even get a little brotherhood from my own little brother. I'm out. That's it? That's all the advice I get? We've checked every lead. Manson and his crew are completely off the grid. Suggestions. Got that one hitter quitter. Come on, Chief! You're stopping me from being great! Voila! What? Voila. In French it translates to "there it is," but here its colloquial meaning... We know what "voila" means! She's asking what are you voila-ing about? Oh. I've completed a spectral analysis of the Woke sample. One of the elements I isolated... is highly unusual. Migale stercore. In English. Ferret shit. Damn! Damn, brother. That's disgusting. But that explains your breath. So, I drank ferret shit? Hashtag gross. Okay, look, y'all need to calm down, all right? What we do know is, whoever's cooking Woke has a pet ferret. Nice. Oh, come on, Brenda, don't do me like that. Albino wino, we need to talk. Whoa! Can't a man and his woman have a little privacy? When you were running the lab, did anybody have a pet ferret? Pet ferret? There was a lab tech named Clifford Wayne. I think he did have a pet ferret. Why do you a... What? A threesome? With him? You disgust me. We're here for our pickup. Mister Bun. Manson's lab. I shouldn't be here. I'm not a kill guy, I'm a get killed guy. No, you'll be fine. Guaranteed. Hey, hold on, hold on. I think something's going down. I gotta tell ya, I am excited to get my hands on your package. Let me pull it out for you. I love the sound of that. Oh, boy, that is much larger than I anticipated. Maybe I should get a closer look. No, no, we good, we good. Time to shoot? Quiet! Oh, damn, my Bluetooth. Ah, damn! Oh, shoot! Finally! Yippee-ki-yay, mother suckers! This is not your baby! They're shooting! They're scattering! Shoot 'em! Cover me. Harvard Brother? Don't talk to me, I'm dead. Reload! Oh, crap! - My eyes! - What is this? Emotional tear gas. It breaks down a person's... defense mechanisms. I use sarcasm to hide the negative things I think about you all. I'm sorry I whispered so harshly. It's just that this is a vital mission and all y'all f'ed it up. Group hug? I'm gonna keep my gun on 'cause I don't trust none of you mother... You so fine, I just wanna give it to you. Come give it to me. I'ma give it to you! I'ma give it to you! Pressure points. Rub my nipple. Rub my nipple, rub my nipple. Yeah, yeah. They should've been back by now. I hate waiting! Oops! Sorry. Though I gotta say, I do feel better. Weird how that is, isn't it? I guess I could find a hobby like yoga or origami, but... why mess with something that's working? Finally! I cannot emphasize enough how much that hat is not working for me right now. What? I like it. I thought it looked militant like the Black Panthers. You look like a French child molester. Now, tell me about the Woke! Well, I'll tell you, but you have to promise not to overreact. Moi? Overreact? You think I overreact? Oh, God! - Antonio! - Oh! Yeah, that was a... a bit of an overreaction, yes, sir. That was an accident. Besides, nobody liked that guy anyway. Straw poll, he was annoying, am I right? Don't encourage him. See, they agree with me. What are you do... Oh, well. Okay. That one was on me. But you know what they say, sometimes to make an omelet, you have to shoot a few eggs. Nobody says that. Anyway, tell me what happened. We went to pick up the Woke, but the BROTHERHOOD was already there. The freaking BROTHERHOOD. Yeah. The freaking BROTHERHOOD? How is that possible? Who messed up? Don't shoot! So, you failed to get the Woke? Yeah. Yeah, and they killed Clifford, our supplier. He got killed in the crossfire. He's a nice guy, we should send his wife a card. He was killed? Yeah. How is that possi... holy crap! This is worse than I imagined! But, but, but we can fix it! We can fix it! We have a crew member with connections to a Russian supplier, that makes an even stronger strain of Woke. Stronger? Yes, sir. You mean, like, super Woke. They call it Woke As Fuck. That's what's up. Okay, Manson... hold it together. Switching to Woke AF could be the perfect move. Look at the vial half full, not half empty. Oh, I'm still so angry right now, I just... Hey, maybe... I have to just let off a little bit of steam. Oh, God! Oh! Shit. Poof. Let's set up that meeting with that Russian supplier. Who's the crew member with the connections? Toby. Toby? I'm gonna need you to wake up. I'm very sorry for what I did! Please don't leave us, Toby! Who was the connection, Toby? Was it Putin? Why'd you smack yourself? Just trying to make sure this is really happening. Oh, this is really happening. Why? Uh-huh. I don't know. Kiss me stupid. Awkward. Look. We all said things we regret. I have intimacy issues. But what's important is that we move on together. I concur completely! Well, then it must be all right. If Mister "I'm Better Than Everyone Else" concurs. I act as if I'm no better than the rest of you when I know for a fact... that I am. Back off, black wanna-but-never-will-be. Join a step team. I don't step. Obvious. You don't step! You're white! Take it back! I can't take it back. Sit down, I got it. What you mean, sit down? Why are you getting up in there? Why are you getting up in... Unattainable Sistah, you ain't that unattainable. At Harvard! Why're you wearing a bow tie and you're not Muslim? Hashtag you can't, hashtag you won't, hashtag you wish! Hashtag you want this! I met Al Sharpton at the airport in Milwaukee when he was fat. You can't talk to me like that! I went to the BLM March, by myself, twice! - Hashtag hell, no! - Excuse me! Excuse me. Sorry I'm late, I was held up doing some things. Yeah, me too, but something completely different. Nothing related to... So, last night was a disaster. But we still managed to screw up Manson's supply chain. That ain't the only thing got screwed last night, now is it? He's right. We also blew our chances to arrest Manson's crew. Something else got blown last night too, now didn't it? The situation's getting worse. Reports of liberal on liberal violence continue to pour in. Minneapolis. Marina del Rey. Wait. I've seen this map before. Yeah, it's called the United States. No, fool, I'm talking about the same points on this map, I've seen before. Yo, can you pull up that viral video of me and them two girls? All right, there it is. Yeah. Pull out, and tighten on this area right here. That's it! The violent outbreaks match the locations of the Resistance Brews. Which means it must be a front for Manson to use to distribute the Woke. We need direct evidence linking Manson and the Resistance Brews to the Woke. Send me inside. Undercover. Seem like she already sent you inside under some covers, now didn't she? Shut up, man, please. Look, last night was a mistake and we're in a make or break case and we can't put our personal feelings ahead of... Yes, I completely agree. I told you all they was doing it! I feel like I'm watching Stella Got Her Groove Back 2. Yeah. But I hate sequels. I guess she likes big thumbs, too. Becoming a hipster should not be taken lightly. I've seen way too many make the change and never come back. I don't care. I'm ready. Make me a hipster. Fine. But may God have mercy on my soul. Hipster conversion test number one. Steak or shamburger? Steak? Man, don't mind if I do. Son of a bitch, man! What was that for? Wrong choice. Hipsters love animals too much to eat them. Next question. Would you like some greens? What? Collard greens. Would you like some? Greens are considered ghetto, so, my answer's no? Failed. Collard greens have become a hipster staple. Right along with kale. What the hell is kale? Thanks for asking. Next up. Aretha Franklin or... All right, I'ma stop you right there. Okay? 'Cause that's a trick question, all right? Ain't nobody gonna choose crap over the Queen of Soul. Becoming a hipster's not about quality. It's about irony. Oh, yeah? Well, I got some irony for your ass. I hoped it wouldn't come to this, but you left me no choice. Oh, God! Oh, God! What is this? La La Land. Complete, undiluted hipster-ism. Make it stop! Make it stop! Hipster overload! Be strong, brother! Be strong! Awesome. So, Lionel went undercover at Resistance Brews to expose the link between Manson and the Woke. Damn, I can't believe they shut down Club Hood for this. How much Maroon 5 can one man take? Um, wow. Awesome customer loyalty. Yeah, it's like once people try our brew they become addicted. Yeah, I heard this place uses fair trade coffee so it's kind of like a way of giving back. Totally. Yeah. Totally. Awesome. You gonna order or what? Yeah, I'll have a latte. Okay. That'll be $28. Hey, man, $28 for some damn coffee? Unless, you don't think the labors of the indigenous peoples of Antigua are worth it. 'Course not, I don't think that at all. What was your name? Phoenix. As Lionel's training continued, I was in a fight of my own. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah. Hey. I just moved my arm. I just moved my a... And I'm talking. I'm talking about talking which I could not do before but now I can. Oh. Hey, Doc. Your nurse just cured me! You sack of shit! That's my wife! I'm sorry, Doc. Your wife just cured my paralysis. Hey. Be cool, Jack. I am going to teach you a lesson you will not soon forget, you ni... Reflex. Later, sucker. Call me, baby. Penis. I've got a latte for Penis. Is there a Penis in the house? Penis! Your... It's not Penis, it's Phoenix. Mh-hmm. Annoying Ho. I have one for the Annoying Ho. It is Anita Jo. That outfit, I don't even know. Give me this. Go. Annoying Ho. Anita Jo. Whatever it is. Yeah, I know! Really? Sorry, dude. Watch where you're going, idiot. Manson's headquarters entrance located. "Hidden camera planted." Nasty. There you are. Oh, God. I want an update on the Woke AF, ASAP! I'm picking up the shipment at midnight. And then bring a case to me. I gotta get Woke, you know, AF! Gotta! Gotta! Gotta! Gotta! Gotta! Gotta! It's all over my pants. Oh! My mistake. Hey, hey, I'll see you tonight with the Woke AF! Hey. Hey. Sixteen... nine, forty-two... Should've written it down, brother. Damn it, would you stop doing that? Always remember, Lionel, all we got is ourselves. Not the pigs, not the government. Our only route to justice is just us. We keep catching hell and catching hell, which is... Would you just stop, okay? 'Cause you're not helping right now, all right? Look, why don't you just go back to where you came from? Now that's just hurtful. Besides, I come from you. I'm a figment of your imagination. Wait. This is all in my head, like this... Well, I'm more an aftereffect of that line drive you took to the head in Little League. But, yeah. Now focus. You can do this. Who am I kidding? Seventeen... Eighty-six, thirty-one, four. Damn. Gonna get your ass, Manson. Got you, got you, got you. Double the trouble, baby. Oh, boy. - Daddy? - Yes, it was The Man who set up this double-double double-cross from the very beginning, disguising himself as a drunken bum in order to lure Manson into a false sense of security then using the BROTHERHOOD to flush out his own son's location. It's pretty complicated, but just take my word for it. It's hella clever and totally makes sense. Bottom line, hot damn, it's The Man. Drop your weapon! This was supposed to be my moment of triumph! Why do you ruin everything? I hate you, I hate you! - Tough titties, sucker. - Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, man. I wouldn't drink that if I were you. Yes, it's 100% pure. It's undiluted. It'll kill you, son! Don't "son" me. And I can handle my Woke. See? Oh, boy. Oh, hell, no! Wow... That was sublime. And you thought it would kill... Oh. My condolences. Thank you. My son may have been a drug-addled homicidal sociopath but at least he wasn't gay. All right. It's over, The Man. You're done. You know, I might agree with you except for one thing. This Woke AF... I happened to grab in all the excitement. Hmm? Ow, it stings! Ow! Ow! That's how you know it's working. My eyes... Agh! Ow! It's like lava tears. Excuse me. I have a racist empire to rebuild. Rest in pieces, son. Everything's beautiful. I'm beautiful. Say it loud! I'm black and I'm proud! Let me tell you something, okay? See, look. I am sexy! I was sexy back in the day, and I'm still sexy now. You know, when you think about slavery for 400 years? 400 years! That sounded like a choice! Die, white devils, die! Black, and I'm... What happened? Take it easy, easy, easy. Don't try and sit up yet, just wait. You had a real bad trip but you're coming out of it good. That was so intense. Ah! Sorry. I was seeing some really bad hallucinations. Those all weren't hallucinations. What? You know, when you think about slavery for 400 years? Yo, is that me at the Capitol Building? 400 years! Yeah. Screaming... Die, white devils, die! "Racist rant at Capitol." 40 million views. Wait, what about The Man? He got away with the Woke, and he's taken over all the Resistance Brews locations. Announcing Blak Coffee. At Blak Coffee, it's all about unity and community. Oh, and also making one badass cup of joe. And with 200 locations coming soon there'll surely be a Blak Coffee coming to a hood near you. Once you go Blak, you never go back. Lionel, he's targeting our people. Hey, hey, what're you doing? Listen, The Man is flooding every hood in America with Woke. The BROTHERHOOD has to stop him. That's what I've been trying to tell you. There is no BROTHERHOOD anymore. After what happened at the Capitol, our backers cut our funding. Look around. This is it. Soon, The Man would have Woke AF sweeping through every black community in America. And there was no BROTHERHOOD to stop him. What it is, little brother? Man, get away from me, a'ight? I'm not about to be lectured by a figment of my imagination right now. Uh, say, brother, did you just call me a figment? Man, you heard me! Dig here. I just spent the last five days getting here from Austria. I couldn't find a pay phone anywhere and I had to stow away on a ship carrying those little tiny sausages. So, I'm uptight, everything is weird, and I'm in no mood for your jive. Do you hear me? Hey, man, I'm not playing. Get outta here, or I'm kicking your ethereal ass. Ethereal? I don't even know what that means. Oh! You okay now? Uh-huh. Never better. Yo, it is you! You back, baby! Oh baby! You back! You back! Ah! After Lionel's dancing, he clued me in on what was really going down at the BROTHERHOOD. Holy shit! Holy, holy, holy shit! Sixteen years? Yeah, it's bad. Bad? Your Go Funk Yourself record was bad. ♪ With the ladies ♪ This is catastrophic. I mean... real talk, bro? I just feel like I let you down. It's not you, brother. It's this 500 years of oppression just keeps on keeping on. Yo, what we gonna do? You know exactly what we gonna do. Hey, look, I held onto this for inspiration, so you know... No, no, no. I didn't mean to take... You hold onto that. We gonna need it a lot more. Sixteen years? Yeah. Is child support retroactive? I think it is. Goddamn! Yeah. Anyone know what this is about? Undercover Brother's brother called and asked for all of us to be here. Oh, my God. That fro is perfect. Undercover Brother. It's him. Oh... It's good to be home. Brother, meet the agents of the BROTHERHOOD. Harvard Brother. Tu mihi magna voluptas est ad receperint! my brother. Sarcastic Brother. It's an honor to meet you. And I'm being totally sincere even though my voice sounds like I'm not. Well, I'm happy to meet you, although my face might look like I might punch you in your face at any second. Not today. Unattainable Sistah. Not... unattainable for you. Go ahead, now. Yeah. Militant Brother. And last, but certainly not least, Chief Honey. Say, brother, is that that chick you were talking about? That's her. You mean that was the one that was doing tricks and stuff. Oh, yeah. Go on. Now, I called you all here today for one reason. And that's to take down The Man. How? We've been decommissioned. We're not the BROTHERHOOD anymore. Listen, we may not be the BROTHERHOOD but we are still a brotherhood. That has been our greatest source of strength all along. We don't need a commission to tell us what's right. Damn it, we know what's right! And it's a matter of us getting things done. Together. And we start by taking down The Man. Okay. Damn. My little brother's grown up. Now, who's in? All right! When do we get started, my ni... new friend? Switch. Everybody bring it in. Brotherhood on three. One, two, three! Brotherhood! Klansmen! Neo-Nazis! Corporate recruiters! Loan officers. Oh, and, of course, our country club owners. My fellow racists. This is the first nationwide distribution of Blak Coffee! Soon black neighborhoods will be hooked on our coffee and being driven mad by Woke AF all while paying us for the privilege. So, on behalf of myself and Brenda, enjoy yourselves and the looming collapse of ebony America! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Woke! Woke! Undercover Brother? Greetings, inexplicably angry white people. Welcome to your worst nightmare. Black me... Black men... with gun permits. With gun permits. On the behalf of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and simple human decency, all y'all suckers are under citizen's arrest. Not here! Or we can play it your way. Oppress this, whitey! It's on, racists! Attack! Oh, you thought this was a game? All right then! This is what I do! This is what I do! Black men taking over! Might I suggest switching to decaf? Duck, duck, duck! I gotcha, I gotcha. Don't worry. I gotcha. Stay down, Brenda. Don't go and get shot, get shot! Move! Move! Other Brendas, attack! We got these blow-up bitches. Y'all get The Man. Cool. Yeah. Stay down, baby. Are you all right? Oh, baby. Freeze, The Man. It's over, sucker. Don't shoot. Or I shoot the lady. Sorry, baby, but The Man's got to do what The Man's got to do. Look, it's over, The Man, all right? There's no avalanche that can save you now. Freeze! Put your hands up! Drop your weapons! Officer, this man is accused of domestic terrorism and scheming to poison black America. Wha... That's a lie. These brothers, they pulled their guns on us and they demanded all of our money. Who you gonna believe? Them? Or us? The police believed us and The Man was sentenced to life in prison. Yeah, right. I said drop your weapons! I see some things haven't changed in the last 16 years. Later, boys. Take a couple thugs off the street. Don't even think about it. It's cool, brother. We'll get The Man next time. Did you just say "we"? Show you right. Once again, the system let The Man disappear. But the fight goes on and it's one we're determined to win. Led by the agents of the BROTHERHOOD, Lionel and me, The Undercover Brothers.
