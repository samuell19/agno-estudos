The last few years of my life have been a roller coaster. But there's was one constant. Jeffrey Wallace. When I wanted to get my record expunged, Jeffrey was there. When we lost people we loved, Jeffrey was there. When I was in trouble, Jeffrey was there. I've been through hell. No! No! And sometimes I didn't think I'd make it out but Jeffrey was always there. But now he's gone. Jeffrey was like a father. Although he'd say more like a big brother, but... He was very special to me. He was always there for all of us. He always believed in us. He was our hero. First Rory, now this. Who's next? Any word on suspects? Motive? I've talked to Joelle a couple of times. Nothing, not a clue. And none of my journalist friends have any Intel. Yeah, radio silence, all around. So what happens to the book club? Do we keep digging? Yeah! And we stay together. Like we always do. Yeah. We owe it to Jeffrey to find out who killed him. I love you guys. I'll see you soon. Yeah. Check up on Miller. Make sure he's okay. I will. Hollis... Hey Joelle. Thank you so much for coming. Are you kidding me? Jeffrey meant the world to me. He adored you. You know, I always thought you were his favorite. I don't know about that but I'm sure gonna miss him. Do you need anything? Anything I can do or... Actually, um, I could use your help settling his affairs. You know, he didn't have much but I want to honor his wishes. Of course. Please call me. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Really turning on the tears, isn't she? People just eat it up. Brian Wallace. Jeffrey was my dad. Yes, of course. Your dad talked about you a lot. And you're Hollis Morgan. He talked about you too. I'm so sorry for your loss. Your dad was truly a great man. The best. He deserved better. Brian? Are you coming back to the house? I think I'll pass. Yeah, okay. It was nice to finally meet you. Yeah, you too. Detective. Hi. Hi. So how're you doing. I'm really sorry. That was a silly question. It's okay. So what's up with the case? Any leads? Nothing that hasn't been reported already. Shot at close range in his office, no suspects, no motives, no murder weapon. How are you doing otherwise? How long before you take the bar? A couple more weeks. You ready? Actually, I wish I had more time but it's either take this one or wait for the next one to roll around in another six months or so. What? What's your deal? How come we never talk about you? I'm sure there's more to the brooding detective than just the habitually loosened ties and the snappy one liners. You got a story? Everyone does. Sure is good to see you again, Hollis. Gene. I got a book from Jeffrey. When I said see you guys soon, I didn't think it'd be tonight. We didn't think we'd be getting mail from the grave. I'm pretty sure that Jeffrey sent these out before he died. Or someone did. Maybe it was the same person who texted us that Jeffrey was dead. That's still a mystery. Yeah, but what about this title, though? "As heroes fall". It's kind of ominous, don't you think? Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Jeffrey recommended books to us all the time. What in...? Miller! There's numbers in these books! Yes. Most books do, Miller. Page numbers, chapter numbers... No no no no. There's handwritten numbers. In the back cover. Look at your books. There's two numbers on each back cover. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Jeffrey was trying to tell us something. That's our Jeffrey! Constantly keeping us on our toes. Even in death. Miller, can you figure out what these numbers mean? Oh come on! You'd have to do every possible combination and then what? One big number that means... Whatever it means, we have to figure it out. I wanna figure out who killed Jeffrey too but, he was an ex-cop. The list of suspects could be longer than my arm. I agree with Miller. Don't think I've ever said that before but... You guys listen to this... It reads "sometimes the one who saves others is the one who needs to be saved." Jeffrey saved us, guys. Now it's time for us to do something for him. And plus, how do we know that whoever killed Jeffrey won't come after one of us next? I'll figure out the numbers. Yeah. And do a deep dive into his finances. That should take all of five minutes. The man was a parole officer. Well the protagonist in "heroes" was a plumber who owned a $2 million dollar home. You read the book that fast? I skimmed it. Apparently he was smuggling art from Italy. Oh, I doubt Jeffrey was smuggling anything. And I doubt he was wealthy. I mean, did you see the man's wardrobe? Hello? Okay. Let's just be sure. Okay, I'll check out the son. Ah, yes. And find out what he does for a living and who he hangs out with. Abby, can you find out if Jeffrey owned any property. Was his house paid up? I already know the answers. No and no. "As heroes fall". We all need to read it. Jeffrey sent this to us for a reason. Hollis. Hey Mark! Hey, are you sure I can't change your mind about leaving the firm? Woo, well. Let me see. The head of our law firm was a murderous, lying, cheating monster who tried to blow me up in an abandoned warehouse and plotted to steal money from little old ladies all while the partners stood idly by. Yeah. I'm sure. Same. Ah... Hey, don't look so surprised. You know I'm a man of principles. Besides, somebody's got to keep you out of trouble. Think anyone will hire us? Hmm. Buy me lunch and I'll tell you what I think. So, here's what I'm thinking. You work for me as a paralegal, and I'll help you prep for the bar. Once you pass, we become full-fledged partners. Balan and Morgan. See I'm seeing Morgan and Balan. B comes before m, so... Okay, fine. What kind of law? General practice. Does this job come with a paycheck? Paycheck is such a dirty word. I'm taking that as a no. You're driving me crazy. Just until we get some clients. Come on, Hollis. Your name on the door right after passing the bar. Who passes up an opportunity like that? Hey! I was definitely going to give you a call. I just wanted to give you some time to... Of course, yes I meant every word. Sure. Sounds great! Okay, see you soon. All right. Bye. That was our first client. She wants to meet. Who? When? Like now! You're driving. Yeah yeah yeah. Let's go. -Grab that! -Yeah yeah. I got it. I thought you were supposed to work for me! Things have always been a bit contentious between my stepson and me. It's a good thing Jeffrey didn't have anything for us to fight over or you'd have your hands full. Well, judging by Jeffrey's will, let's see, there's the boat and a car. Are we missing anything? That's about it, really. There is some small bonds and investments. But, ah... Not much to show for all those years of hard work, huh? I wrote down what I know of. Oh yeah. That looks like a working man's savings. We can take care of this in no time. I'll get a digi-sign retainer sent over to you and... Could you drop it off, please? I'm embarrassed to say, I'm not very tech savvy. It's not a problem. I'm pretty tactile myself. Well, I guess that's about it then. Thank you so much for your time, Mark and Hollis. Thank you Mrs. Wallace. I'll show them out, joelle. Hey, um... Watch your back with her. What do you mean? I think she killed my father. With all due respect, "Mr. Commissioner," I don't get how I keep getting stuck with these scratch and dent partners. I mean, last year it was the wannabe boy band member and now, this over-educated drama queen who's trying to clinch her family's inheritance by following in daddy's footsteps. Detective Lincoln is not that bad. Not if you're casting a reality TV star. Don't let this go to your head, Jon, but her dad wanted her to work with the best. And that's you. Well I'm flattered her dad, our illustrious district attorney, thinks so highly of me but, come on. It's not a good fit. It's not an arranged marriage. She's a partner. Give it time. As for the other guys, they'll need time too. You'll win them over. Eventually. Once a fighter always a fighter, right? Look, Lincoln is just a spoiled... Hey! Detective Lincoln! Hey there, commissioner. Got a minute? Absolutely. My parents just wanted to make sure that you and Hailey were joining us at the club for dinner this weekend. I wouldn't miss it for the world. I told them i'd check in with you. Yeah. No problem. Okay gene Donovan, meet Kaila Gentry. We grew up together. We're like sisters than friends. Oh! She's been here a couple months, working for news4all. And I thought it was about time she met a fellow journalist. Well nice to meet you, kaila. News4all, huh? Yeah. I know, I know. Not exactly a paragon of journalistic virtue. Not paragon of anything at all. Well Kaila's gonna change that. Right? I'm gonna try. That's why I wanted her to meet you, gene. I mean, I think she could use some advice on how to deal with these Philadelphia big wigs. Yes, well, I never give advice on an empty stomach. So get the first round of drinks and I'll tell you everything I know! Well, not everything! Well, look, okay, if I had my pick of the crop it wouldn't be news4all. We all have to start somewhere! Cheers! Where's your car? Oh, I'm illegally parked over here. Oh, okay. Bye! -Bye. -Good night! Love you, girl. Kaila! Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. That was no accident. That car tried to run you over. What the hell is going on? I, ah... I've been working on a story about Dorian fields, the CEO of a charity called fields of giving. Thank you. I'm familiar. I received an anonymous tip that the organization is mismanaging funds. Fields caught wind of my investigation and slapped news4all with an injunction to keep me from posting the story. I kept investigating on my own though. Do you have proof? My source has close ties to fields' inside person who sets up bogus charities for lgbtq+ youth, veterans, disaster relief, you name it! Who's the inside person? The name on the documents is Joey Barnes. Look, I just need to protect my source and my data. Our friend, Miller, he can digitize and encrypt those documents. He can transfer them somewhere safe. Thanks, girl. Look, I just need to move fast before my source stops feeding me information. Or worse. Something happens to them. Let's also make sure nothing happens to you. You should come with me to my self defense class in the morning. You want to take down a would-be assailant focus on his vulnerable areas. Remember when we were little and you used to sneak into my mom's closet and try on her fake furs? You mean her fake fake furs? How could I forget? You know, that sparked my love for fashion. You've always had an eye. Okay. You were always so fearless. To a fault, I might add. You were going to save the world all while rocking my designs. Me? I'll start by saving the world from people like Dorian fields. Yeah, well, if anyone is going to take him down, it's you. Sorry. Late night. Work or pleasure? Neither. Just the creaking sounds of justice keeping me up. Keep the coffee hot. Many sleepless nights await. For now, let's talk about our first case. I filed the will. Oh. I have that... Where where where's that? Great. I have the inventory of Jeffrey's valuables right here. Yeah, this doesn't make any sense. Why would somebody kill this guy? He's got a car and an old boat. Can't be worth more than $20,000 grand combined. That doesn't add up. Yeah, I know. I couldn't agree with you more. By the way, I got you breakfast. Yeah, where is it? I'm starving. I ate it. You were late. Come on! Yikes. Nothing like taking your frustrations out on a lumpy old bag that can't punch back. You okay, man? When is it gonna go away, Dave? You know, I bust my ass 12, 16 hours a day. Yeah, I follow the rules. And one lack in judgement, you know, it cost me my career climb well, that error nearly cost a man his life, Jon. Internal affairs cleared me. You know that. And you know that other cops don't care what IA has to say. Do you? Come on, Jon. You get all the best cases. What's your beef? Look, it's not about the best cases. It's about being respected by the people I work with. It's about being trusted. Patience, grasshopper. Get to work! I'm at Kaila's. Miller, how am I supposed to know what time to meet you if you won't tell me? Rena we have to be careful. We don't know who's listening. Okay, well I can't crack a code every time I need to talk to you. No, look, Rena... Okay, look. Never mind. I'll just, I'll bring everything to your house later and we can just... Miller, I'll call you back. Kaila? Kaila... Kaila? No no no no. Kaila! No! No! No! No! Kaila! Ms. Martinez, when was the last time you saw ms.Gentry? This morning at the gym. Did she seem depressed or...? She didn't kill herself, if that's what you're implying. She wouldn't give up that easy. Do you know anyone who might have wanted to see her dead? Rena and gene said that kaila was doing an expose on the CEO of a big non-profit. Dorian fields. Okay... An anonymous source gave her some damning evidence of wrongdoing at the charity. Fields was pretty upset about it. Upset enough to kill her? It certainly looks that way, doesn't it? We'll pick this back up tomorrow. Yeah. Why don't you go home and get some rest. Let's go. Call you later. Okay? So what do you think? I think that you and your fellow sleuths should sit this one out. Your friend really needs you right now. And you need to focus on your bar exam. You know, it's interesting... For a man who's so tight-lipped about his own life, you sure do have a lot to say about mine. Thanks for breakfast. Of course. As lovely as it was I can't help wondering if maybe you have something on your mind besides French toast and dark roast. Do you know Dorian fields? Of course. He gave me my first million-dollar listing. Sold it after two showings so, needless to say, he likes me. Do you like him? Let's see...He could have gotten any broker to sell his house but he chose me. So, yeah, I love the guy. I think he might have had Rena's friend killed. What? She was a reporter for news4all. Doing an expose on him. Hollis! That's a serious accusation. I know. I know. I told Rena we'd help her figure out who killed kaila. So tell me about Dorian. Tell me about him. He's loaded. Connected. Powerful. The full trifecta. Okay, but what about like loving, compassionate, generous? Come on. He runs a non-profit. Does he use donations to buy real estate... Okay, Hollis, stop! Stop! Are you sure you want to do this? Cause I'm not sure I want to do this. -Are you afraid of this guy? -No. I... Then what? Dorian and I move in the same circles. I don't want him to think that I'm poking around in his affairs. It could be very bad for my business. And we can't have that, can we Abby? Okay, that's not fair! Some of us have a lot to lose. I don't? Rena doesn't? Look... We're not all as fearless as you are. You need to dial it down a bit here. Why are you even looking into this case when we don't even know what happened to Jeffrey? Because Rena's our friend and she's hurting. Hell, we're all hurting. I just can't sit back and do nothing. I'll see what I can find on Dorian. Discreetly. So Brian. You wanted to see us. I know I just seem like a guy who hates his stepmother but that's not the case. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do hate her but it's more than that. I think she was having an affair. Okay... With whom? I'd rather not say. Did Jeffrey know about this? I told him but he didn't believe me. At least he pretended he didn't. What does that mean? I think he was planning to leave joelle for another woman. Ano... What other woman? Who who was she? I don't know. But I'm worried. I mean, people are winding up dead. I think joelle and her lover, I think they might have killed my dad. Okay, back up. Who died besides your dad? Nobody. I meant him. All right. What's going on with my dad's estate? He said someday he would leave me his boat. It's like a hundred years old and probably not worth much but I'd like to list it as soon as possible. Might be enough cash to get out of town. You're leaving town? Yeah, soon as possible. That doesn't make you look suspicious at all. Well, my mom's gone, my dad's gone. I don't really have a reason to stay here. Right? So if you could speed things up, I could really use the cash. I think Joelle's probably going to try to pin the murder on me. But... look, I didn't do it! I didn't kill my dad. I loved him. I take it we're not going to wait on Rena. No. We don't have that much time. She'll be here. What've we got? I'm still working on the number combinations that Jeffrey wrote in the books but it's a lot of numbers and a lot of combinations. It's taking longer than I though it would. Okay, how much longer? I don't know. It's a lot of combinations. A lot of possibilities for where they can land. So, I'm just going to keep working. I won't rest until I'm done. Okay. Okay okay. Abby? If you guys tell anyone this I will deny it. Dorian fields paid off the mortgage on the news4all headquarters. Okay. Well, now we know who's calling the shots at that outlet. No wonder Kaila's article got shut down. We need to get to Kaila's source. Or at the very least, find her evidence. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure her evidence is in police custody now. Either that or the killers found it when they murdered her. Hmm. True. Okay, so where are we on the Jeffrey front? Brian's convinced that our beloved hero is unfaithful to his wife. What makes him think that? I don't know. I don't know. But who else is afraid we might find out Jeffrey wasn't the Saint we thought he was. Has anyone heard from Rena? Rena Martinez. Dorian fields. Please. So, I was delighted to get your invitation to meet. I'm a huge fan of your designs. So... What can I do for you? The question is, what can I do for you, Mr. Fields. Let me get a steak sandwich. Make that two. All right. Hope you're hungry. Thank you. Detective! Jonathan. -Hey. -Hi. -How are you? -I'm good. You know, just grabbing some lunch and studying. Yeah, me too. Ah, grabbing lunch. So how much do you know about Brian and joelle Wallace? Look, I thought I told you to stay away from the investigation you know, Brian is pretty sure that his stepmother had something to do with his dad's death. And let me guess. She's convinced that he killed him, right? So any number one suspects? I don't have one. Really? Yeah, the case has been handed over to another detective. Why? I'm on the kaila gentry case now since it's been officially ruled a homicide. Was there ever any doubts? Well the manner in which she died suggested suicide. But? But forensics revealed that she was already dead, or close to it, when she was placed in the car. We just released a statement. Blunt force trauma to the head. I got to go. You should, ah, get back to your lunch. So, where we at with Jeffrey Wallace? Hollis. Where are you going? Hollis! What's going on? I got to go Mark. I'll call you later. Rena! Are you sure you know what you're doing? Come on, Hollis. You're not the only super sleuth. I got this. Super sleuth! You know, even if I don't get the goods on him, I'll still expose my line to a bunch of snooty rich folk who might just become potential clients. Yeah, but I thought your designs were supposed to be high fashion for the everyday girl. Well, rich girls live everyday too, don't they? Look, relax. Getting close to fields means one step closer to finding out who killed kaila. Yeah, but how are you have your designs ready in time for the event? I'll put my models in one-of-a-kind samples. The rich and famous will bid on what they want and I'll make custom designs for them. Okay. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. You handle this and I'll stay on top of the Jeffrey case. Just call us sleuth sisters. Sleuth sisters... okay. What's the next step with Mr. Fields? Well, he's coming over tomorrow to check out the pieces for the auction. You know, after a few drinks he's more a philanderer than a philanthropist so I'll make sure the models are on break. Smart girl. Smart girl. Ah, one more thing. Do you have any unused office space you could spare? I'm sure we can figure something out. I got to go. Where are you going? Oh, just... Happy hour with the boys. But, but... Make yourself at home. Call you later. Okay... I don't like this. Why are we breaking into Kaila's house. It will just take a second. I just need a little light here. What are we looking for? Evidence. The documents that she told us about. Where do we start? I mean, she's got a Lotta stuff in here. Well think. Where would kaila hide something of value? Well she would definitely think outside the box. Oh, and here is the box. Gene. Miller. Miller, come here. I can't make heads or tails of this stuff. Didn't these people ever hear of digital bookkeeping and online spreadsheets? Wait. From the desk of Jeffrey a. Wallace? We should call Hollis. Come on, Jon. Hands up you always leave yourself vulnerable. Come on! Hey! You could have told me to meet you somewhere else. But then you wouldn't get a chance to show off your elite boxing skills. Your text said it was urgent, so... Yes! We found these documents at kaila gentry's house. Yeah, I heard someone crossed the police line last night. I should've known it was you. It was not... me. Can you just look at the documents? I will. Okay, so you're mad because I... Someone broke the rules and... What else is new? Okay, just call me when you look over everything. You're a fighter aren't you? When I have to be. Yeah, I'm a fighter. Gene, hey. I gave Faber the documents. He's gonna review them and get back to me. Excellent! Hey, ah, could you do me a favor? It has nothing to do with Dorian fields or Jeffrey. Can you do some digging for me? Sure. Who's the target? Jonathan Faber. Your work is every bit as exquisite as you said it was. Well, honesty is the best policy, Mr. Fields. Call me Dorian, please. I love your confidence. And you know, showcasing your work at the silent auction, it's going to expose you to so many potential clients, possibly even some investors. And all for a good cause. Absolutely. You know you could have a really bright career, Rena. I could see to that. The thing is, you just have to choose your friends very very carefully. Well, you know, I've actually read a lot about you. -You did? -Yes yeah. I have to say that your rise to success has been pretty rapid and impressive. All while serving others. I just hope someday I could be one of those wealthy investors. Actually, I could probably make a small donation now. I'm all about helping people in need. Just like you. Wow! Beautiful, talented and compassionate. You my dear, you are the perfect package. Oh, thanks. Yeah, so, I would love to make a donation to a charity. Potentially something that empowers young girls. Right, it's just, um... I'm afraid that's not exactly how it works. Oh? Yeah, it's, ah... We like to spread out the money equally to all our charities so that they thrive. It's kind of like a pooled fund. Right. Got it. So how do I know if they get an equal share? Or if they get a share at all? How does the overhead work? I'm actually embarrassed to say I don't know all the minutiae, all the little details. But I have a team of financial experts, they handle all that. I just bring in the money. Of course. So, listen, I actually gotta run, Rena. But I just want to say I am so looking forward to this. Thank you so much for doing it. The show's going to be great. And if there's anything you need, like anything... You don't hesitate. Okay? Yeah yeah. Thank you. All right. All right. You're great. You do such good stuff. Thanks. Hey Hollis. Yeah yeah. No I couldn't get anything out of him. Not yet anyway. Listen, we, we need to figure out why Jeffrey's stationary was in Kaila's envelope. Yeah. I gave the documents to Faber let's see what he says. In the meantime, I think we need to go to Jeffrey's office and do a little snooping. You game? Girl, you know I am. But first I need to change into something more parole officer-like. I'll meet you there. Okay, you keep an eye out, I'm going in. Keep your phone handy. I'll let you know if anyone comes. -Roger that. -Roger that. Pretty easy evening, right? Yeah. I wanna say I'm surprised to see you but... Well, I'm definitely surprised to see you. Didn't you say this was no longer your case? What are you doing here? Miller, this is not a good time. Can you do me a favor? While you're at Jeffrey's can you try to find something with his handwriting on it. I'm hoping to match it to the writing we found on the note. Okay, but the cops have the note. Did you memorize the handwriting? Miller? So, detective Faber... Who's the number one suspect, huh? Oh come on, seriously. I know you have an idea. Look, what I can tell you, is that the casings found at the scene were traced back to a ghost gun. Maybe someone we didn't even think about? Right. But who had a close enough relationship to Jeffrey? I mean, someone who would want to kill him to keep a secret? Anyone come to mind? Interesting. You coming? You know what? I think I need to use the ladies room. Yeah.... Okay? Be right out... have a good evening, detective. All right. Be careful, Ms. Morgan. Night. Hey! Okay, so... I got documents signed by Jeffrey so that Miller can match the handwriting to the scribble on the note. Great. What else did you find? Not much, really. But I took a bunch of photos. There's that Brandy bottle. Did anyone have a close enough relationship to Jeffrey? Someone who might want to see him killed to keep a secret? Oh! Brandy? You got a bottle of wine stashed somewhere? No. I leave wine for the lightweights like you and Abby. That's our Jeffrey. Constantly keeping us on our toes. I think he was planning to leave joelle for another woman. What? Huh? Oh nothing nothing. Let's just go. Okay. Yeah yeah. Okay. Yeah, I know I know. It's not your brand. It'll do. What's with the Brandy? It was Jeffrey's favorite. And Rory's. So, listen... Do you think maybe next time we could meet for lunch? Not 7 A.M. or 10 P.M. Michael's just, getting suspicious. Should he be? I don't really know how to say this and sound all dainty and quiet. But I'm just gonna spit it out. Were you and Jeffrey having an affair? Jeffrey was my friend. We talked about our marital problems. Maybe a little more than we should have. We cried into our drinks maybe a little more than we should have. Is that your answer? What do you want me to tell you? Just the truth. Were you and Jeffrey having an affair? It's just a simple yes or no question. No. It isn't. Marriage is hard, Jeffrey. I mean sometimes I wish I could just... Throw in the monogrammed towels. Tell me about it. At least your spouse is a responsible, upstanding citizen. But he didn't marry one. I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you to talk to. You've always been there for me. You mean the world to me. You know that? Jeffrey was one of the closest friends I ever had. He was always there for me. It wasn't a whirlwind romance. It was a moment. And we weren't proud of it, but we didn't regret it either, so to answer your question... It was complicated. How did you find out? Clever deduction. Process of elimination. Just a lucky guess. So... Go ahead. Go ahead. Ask me. Did I have anything to do with his murder? Do you know who killed Jeffrey? No. I loved him, Hollis. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but I know how much you looked up to him. And I didn't want you to think less of him. Of me. We just needed each other. I understand. Are you going to tell the angels? The police? It's not my story to tell. Hey. Yeah, I'm just leaving a client meeting. I'll be home shortly. What the hell are you doing lurking around here by yourself? Are you okay? Sure. I'm fine. Oh, there you go. Hey. Hey, so, of course, Miller called the meeting and he's not here! Anybody know what's up? Yeah, the fact that Miller called a meeting at all is weird. I haven't been home, I haven't done anything yet. Well, he called me when we were in Jeffrey's office... Wait! What? You were at Jeffrey's office? What am I missing? What the hell is going on with you people? No seriously. Guys! Oh, there you are. Okay! I figured it out. It's a code. It's a routing code! You remember the note? You remember the note that we found in Kaila's envelope? Yeah. I'm sorry. The handwriting didn't match Jeffrey. I didn't find a clue there. I'm sorry Rena. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You kept the note, Miller? I thought we gave everything to Faber. Yeah. No. Just this one. You can get mad at me later, okay? This is bigger than this. So so, I was going through the numbers, I was going through the numbers. I had so many notepads, so many numbers, so many combinations. It was kind of fun at first but then I was like I'm not sure if I want to do this anymore. But then I picked this up to do the comparison of the handwriting and when I turned it over there's all this scribbling on the back of the note. All this scribbling. But here I found the numbers 702 214 75702 2154075. What does it mean? Is it a phone number? No it's not a phone number. It's a routing code to a bank account in the Cayman Islands. Jeffrey owns it and it's got a balance of $5 million dollars. Are you sure? Where the hell would Jeffrey get $5 million? Why would he keep it in an offshore account? Clearly because he didn't want anyone to know about it! Maybe it was some kind of payoff? No! Jeffrey would never take a payoff. Okay. There must be some other explanation. But guys! Why would there be a page from Jeffrey's notepad found amongst Kaila's stuff? With Kaila's name and address on it. But Jeffrey didn't write it. Then who did? It had to be someone who had access to Jeffrey's office. Yeah, maybe his wife. Or his son. Yeah. Well, what do we do? We're going to keep it under wraps until we get more information. I cannot keep it under wraps! Okay? I'm handling Jeffrey's estate. I have a fiduciary responsibility to his family. I assume they already know. Right? What if they do? What if that's why he was murdered? Okay. I'll keep the note a secret but I have to tell them about the money. Okay? I can't afford for this to come back and bite me. I'm trying to pass the bar... Of course, of course. Do what you gotta do, Hollis. We'll just let the chips fall where they may. Bye. Hollis, nice find! I know. Right? This place is great. Whoo! She did good! Oh, I told joelle and Brian we wanted to talk to them. Do you think they knew about the offshore accounts? We'll find out soon enough. I suppose we... Hollis? Is that you? It's her. The girl from your hearing. -Hi Rena! -Hey girl. Oh by the way, that's Mark... The lawyer I was telling you about. You guys met at my hearing. -Hey. -Hi. Are you ready to go meet... Joelle and Brian? Huh? Okay. Judging by your reactions, I'm going to assume you didn't know about the money. I had no idea. What happens now? Well, I'm going to be honest with you. Offshore banks don't have the best reputation for cooperating with foreigners so it may be a while before we find out if Jeffrey even named a beneficiary. Doesn't money like that usually go to a... Spouse? Or a child? Okay. Let's not speculate here. Did the police know about this? Uh... no. But, we are going to tell them. Yes! They're going to think I killed Jeffrey for sure. So, back to this money. Can we trust you two to keep this under wraps for now? Of course. Okay, your discretion will make it easier for us to protect you and your interests in this money. Oh, excuse me for one minute. I just need to take this really quickly. Don't leave me with them. You'll be fine. You've got this. Excuse me. Hola! I got some juicy info on your boy Faber. Really? So, what'd you find? Well, apparently Faber acted on a hunch and ignored protocol. His partner almost got killed. Faber spiraled, Dave Walker, remember, well they were friends back in Chicago. He got Faber to move to Philly. Okay. He got tried to keep his records under wraps but, you know, some of the cops caught wind of the internal investigation, and needless to say, they aren't too crazy about Faber. I also have a little tidbit about his partner detective Lincoln. Oh do tell. Dorian fields donated to daddy's re-election campaign. Lincoln family roots run deep in this city and she's the only one who hasn't made a name for herself in law enforcement or politics. So what are you going to do with all this information about your cop crush? I don't know. What would you do? Hmm... Save it for a rainy day. Why do I have the feeling that your interest in Faber's background is more personal than professional? Okay! So got to go. Thanks for the info. My apologies. Okay... So we're good? Did you see a car or anything, Ms. Martinez? No no. There was nothing outside. I didn't see anything. Rena! Rena, what happened? What happened? Gunshot through her front door. Are you all right? Are you hurt? I'm okay. Thank you. Clearly, someone thinks you know something, that you have some kind of damaging information. Well, we do. What about the documents that Hollis gave you? It's a good thing you didn't get shot over those. There's wasn't anything I found that wasn't already on your friend's computer. So you're telling me that kaila died for nothing? That she had no hard evidence? Well, it looks that way. But the killer didn't know that. Which also means they don't know how much you know. That's why you need to be careful. I'd hate to see something to happen to either one of you. Which is why I'm assigning protective duty to you both. Look, I need you to keep a low profile for the next couple of days until I get to the bottom of things. No. No can do. Yeah. No. We have the fields of giving fundraiser tomorrow night. My designs are on display. You've got to be kidding me right now? No, she's not kidding and neither am I. We have to find out who this Joey Barnes guy is. I'm sure he's connected to all of this. Well, then I'm assigning an officer to you. I'll take Rena. Officer of the law. And you know, Hollis and I, we work here. Mark can take me. I'll be fine. Fine. Then, Hollis... Absolutely not! No. I'm not spending my evening being chaperoned by some clingy detective I barely know. No. No. Okay, then I'll go with you. And keep an eye on you. And you of course! Actually, that's not a bad idea. Because if something goes down, you can just like arrest the person right there on the spot. Sure. Look, do I need a ticket for this thing? Ah, no. I got you covered. Actually, do you have a suit? Do you own a suit? Like a nice suit? Actually I do. Of course you do. Sorry. So it's a date. A pretend date. Protective duty date. Yeah. I'll pick you up at 7. Actually, I'll meet you there because I might have to help Rena set some things up. I'll send a car then. A... nice car. Not a police car. Ahem... Peace offering? I didn't realize we were fighting. Listen, I know things haven't been easy for you around here. They haven't been easy for me either. Everyone just assumes I'm only here because of my father. So you're not? Sorry. I forgot we were being nice. I know you think you got stuck with me because, well, nobody else wants to be your partner. So much for being nice. But, if we are going to be stuck with each other, we may as well make the most of it. Right? Let's prove them wrong. You know, as much as I hate to admit it, I do like the sound of that. I know you haven't been straight up with me about the kaila gentry case. Hey, look, if Dorian fields is involved, we need to expose him. Okay, look. I don't know a whole lot about Dorian fields' involvement. Not yet anyway, but, you're right. We'll figure it out. Partner. Partner. You look really... lovely. Beautiful. You look beautiful. Nice suit. Love the tie. Shall we? Thank you. So what exactly are you looking for here? Anything that has Joey Barnes' name on it. Oh! Look at you! You look amazing! You look beautiful! Kisses! Kisses! Mowah! Mowah! -Ms. Caldwell. -Detective. Listen, let me know if you need anything. I've got your back tonight, okay? You got me. I'm good. Abby Caldwell! Dorian. How are you? I am... I'm grand. I'm grand. Listen, I might have a listing for you. I might have several in fact. So you call me this week, okay? All right... So Abby, where's Michael. He... Didn't come. Excuse me. Whoa Hollis! You look... -Wow! -Thank you! And how about this goddess right here? Oh, goddess? I like it. Many more compliments where that came from, Bella Donna. Oh, you're good. Did you know your partner was going to be here? No. But I can't say I'm surprised given her family connections. Jon! I didn't expect to find you here. I'm her escort. Not an escort, just a... I got it. I got it. -Nice to meet you. -Pleasure to meet you. Oh, ah, Dave, Hollis. Hollis this is commissioner Dave Walker. Pleasure to meet you. And my wife Nicole. Listen to me. Have some fun tonight. Yes sir. Mr. District attorney! Dorian my friend, how are you? Oh I could not be any better. You remember my daughter, Monica. You know, you brag about her every single time I see you. You do. It is good to meet you, again detective. Hey, golf this weekend, Ken? You got it buddy! -I'll go easy on you. -I'd appreciate that. Monica... Dad, listen... You listen, sweetheart. It won't kill you to hang up the tough cop routine for one night. Especially when you're talking to one of my biggest donors. I don't trust the guy. Well, then trust me. I know people. Ahem... Good evening, folks! I promise that I will not take too much of your time. First of all, Rena. How great are her designs? Absolutely exquisite. I really, simply just want to thank our donors. Thank you. We are so so grateful. And last, but certainly certainly not least, my right hand... Joey. Come on up. Come on. Thank you. There she is. That's joelle! Joelle is Joey Barnes! I know. She was one of the first people I checked out when I was put on the Wallace case. Barnes is her maiden name. Wait, hold on hold on hold on. You knew and you didn't tell me? What, so you could run off half-cocked, confront her, possibly get yourself killed. Seriously? -Joelle? -Exactly! Faber, you have to arrest her! I will, but I just have to make sure the arrest sticks. I got to follow protocol. One more photo and then I think I have to leave. Did you hear about something? Ladies' room. Come on. I'm sorry. Bye bye. Okay, so all we need are copies of those fake contracts to match Joelle's handwriting, right? Yeah. And if it matches up to the note on Jeffrey's letterhead and the signature on the retainer she signed for me and Mark, we've got her. Perfect. -Let's do it. -Okay. Dorian's office should be around here somewhere. Okay. This is it. Here, use this. It's perfect. It's stuck. Well, Hollis... Needless to say, your firm is fired. I'm sorry. Before you get any crazy ideas you should know I’m an excellent shot. One whimper, scream or... You're not that great a shot. You missed me last time. I was just trying to scare you. I needed you to back off! And you wanted kaila to back off too. That's why you killed her. I didn't want to. But she wouldn't stop. She just kept digging and prying. She was going to ruin everything! What about Jeffrey? Did you kill him too for the $5 million? I didn't know about the money until you told me. We could have had the life I always wanted. But he chose to keep it hidden away from me. Why would he do that? So you turned to Dorian, your partner in crime. Yes. But I fell in love with the guy. What about poor Jeffrey? Did you even consider him in any of this? Jeffrey was my white knight. He taught me to dream of a better life for myself. But he could never give it to me. Or he chose not to. Joelle, you don't have to do this. This is the only thing I can do. I'm sorry Hollis. Rena. Rena. Look at me. Look at me! Rena look at me. Kaila would not want you to do this. Don't do it. Breathe. Come on, Rena, breathe. I got you. I got you. Breathe. Breathe, come on. Breathe. -Hi. -Hi. -What is going on here? -We're just going to have... This is very embarrassing. I actually have... I'm just going to slip out for a sec... We're just going to have a little talk. Right... At the station. Take him to the station. I was just going to say... All right. -Okay. -Okay. What the hell are you doing, Jon? Joelle has just confessed to killing kaila gentry. She also set up a raft of fraudulent activities within the fields of giving organization. I hope you know what you're doing. We have a recorded confession. You better do everything by the book. Our butts are going to be on the line for this. Understood. I'm going back to the station. See you there. Hey hey hey. Are you guys okay? What happened? Everything! I got justice for my girl. Thanks to this one. We did it together. And now we finally know why Kaila's name was in Jeffrey's notebook. Joelle put it on there. Joelle said she didn't kill him. And she didn't know anything about the $5 million. Then who killed him. And why? I'm going to go. Wait. What? Where are you going? To the police station. I have a feeling that Kaila's death and Jeffrey's death are more closely linked than we realize. Got to get justice for Jeffrey too. Okay. Are you ready? What are you doing? I'm coming with you. No, Hollis, this is a police matter. I still need to take all these people in for questioning. Okay. I'm coming with you. Let's go. No, you're not. You're going home. I can't... Because you're my police escort. Fine. Fine. But you wait in my office. I'm not going to let any of these people get off on a technicality. Okay. Come on. Skedaddle. Oh! Remind me to tell you about Jeffrey's $5 million dollar bank account on the way. Wait! What? Five million? Hollis. Hollis! Yeah, so, that was my evening. Now I just sit and cool my heels and wait for the interrogations to start. Wait. Are you in Faber's actual office? -Yep. -Okay. That station should have a wired closed circuit. Do you have access to his computer? Kind of. Okay, look for a tab that says conferencing. You should be able to scroll through the cameras. Let me see. Let me see. Miller, you're a genius. Thanks. I know. We still need to figure out who killed Jeffrey? Shh! Shh! I'll put you on speaker phone. We might find out. Hold on, hold on. Well, Mr. Fields. Your lawyer is on her way. Great. Great great. Is there anything you'd like to share with us in the meantime? Anything that Joey, I’m sorry, joelle, was up to, was definitely not at my level of review. Hmmm. Were you having intimate relations with joelle Wallace, aka Joey Barnes? No. No. No. It wasn't that. So if we get a search warrant for your house, cars, bedroom, we're not going to find any of her DNA? Solicitation, extortion, etc. We know you killed kaila gentry. Did you also kill your husband to get your hands on the $5 million he had stashed away in the Caymans? I didn't know about the $5 million. I learned about it from Hollis and Mark. How did your husband get his hands on that kind of money? I have no idea. I swear. Let's talk about your work with fields of giving. Did you know that joelle Wallace stands to inherit $5 million dollars now that her husband is dead? Why would I know that? We found this sign-in sheet from Jeffrey Wallace's office from a few weeks ago. So what? My name is not on that. No, it's not. You did fake your name but you didn't fake your signature. See we had a handwriting expert determine that this is in fact your handwriting, sir. Wanna know what we think? Dorian knew about the $5 million. He figured if he killed your husband, he could sweet talk you out of your inheritance and maybe even get you to take the fall for his murder. Do you know who Dorian was when I first met him? Small time con man, hustling people in the streets. I built his empire. And now he's double crossing me. I guess there's no honor amongst thieves, huh? I know how to connect Dorian to Jeffrey's murder. Oh, bad news for you, Dorian. Looks like your girlfriend is rolling over on you. Which is a shame because I could have sworn she was the one who killed her husband. I guess I was wrong. But you know what? My investigating wasn't completely in vain. What are you even talking about? Oh right! You see this man? His name is John Paluto. Now John and joelle have a rather shady history. She introduced you to him so he could help launder some of your fields of giving profits. So what? He also knew Jeffrey Wallace. Maybe he killed him. Maybe, he and joelle did it! Wow! Now why didn't we think of that! It's a really good thing that we brought John in for questioning. Even better that he struck a deal with us. He told us he defaulted on a loan to you... -Oh, he said that? -And to pay up. He offered you access to a much bigger haul. The $5 million dollars he set up for Jeffrey Wallace in the Caymans, unbeknownst to his wife. Now he also told us you were planning on blackmailing Jeffrey and handing all of it over to you. -He said that? -Uh huh. You do not have one ounce of proof! You have nothing! This is... You have nothing. Hollis, I think I got something! What what what what? What are you talking about? I accessed the security footage from Jeffrey's office. And using my self-taught expertise in image forensics, I was able to determine that the video was, in fact, manipulated. And quite well, I might add. They used sophisticated video editing software that relies on mathematical equations to create sort of a blurring effect that mask reality. So wherever I saw the blurred effects on the video, or pieces of video that had been manipulated or omitted. Pieces that show Dorian at the scene! Dorian was quite careful to allude most of the cameras. The artful dodger that he is, but... His reflection. He couldn't hide his reflection. And I caught it in one of the mirrors in Jeffrey's office. Wait a minute! What? In the mirror? We got him, Hollis! We got him! Send me the footage and I'll show it to Faber. Hurry, okay? Hurry! It's already on the way. We got him, Jeffrey. We got him. I don't even want to know how Miller got this footage or why. We'll get our guys on it. You can pretend you figured it out all by yourself! Sure. Some date. Are you kidding me? You took down two murderers in one night. With your help. And the other book club members. Let's get out of here. What's gonna happen to Jeffrey's money? Is it going to be returned to the authorities now? Well, depends on how well the bank cooperates and whether or not Jeffrey had any final requests. Dorian still thinks it's all going to joelle but, who knows? I had a good night tonight, detective! I guess. Seriously? No... Listen, I know what it feels like to be judged by your past and have people think they know you because they heard about something you may have done wrong. But for what it's worth, I think you're one hell of a detective. And a pretty awesome guy too. Perfect. Come on. That was an interesting evening, right... Hollis! Hollis! Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! I'm sorry sorry sorry... No, it's okay! This is Jeffrey's son. -Hey. -Hi Brian. I heard the news. My dad told me you were smart. He knew something was going to happen to him. I tried to save him. I really did. I really did. I'm sorry. Stop stop stop! It's okay. It's okay. Dear Hollis, there are a couple more things I think you should know about my dad. I know you still have questions and I hope I can at least answer one of them. He told me about the five million dollars right before he was killed. He'd taken a pay off back in the day because he needed money for my mom's medical bills. I didn't want to say anything because I was scared and I didn't want to get him in trouble. He did it out of love for my mom. And by the way, I was Kaila's source. And I was the one who sent you guys the group text... And the books. If anything should happen to me, son, I want you to send these books to the members of the book club. Grab that notepad. I'm going to give you their names and addresses. Contact them immediately. Ready? Abby Caldwell, 2027 Lakefield street. You got that? Hollis Morgan... My dad knew something was going to happen to him. I tried to save him... But I couldn't. I've left town for awhile but I have a feeling I'll be back. And you'll be happy to know I kept my dad's boat. Thanks for being a good friend to my dad. He always said you were his favorite. Well you're my favorite too. Love Brian. Detective Faber. Am I in trouble? Not that I know of. I just wanted to congratulate you on taking the bar. How do you feel? I feel good. You are going to make an excellent attorney. I'm really looking forward to our professional paths crossing. Our professional paths? Well, now that you mention it... That 'pretend date' of ours, it was quite adventurous. Indeed, yeah it was. I was wondering if you would consider a 'real' date? You know, one that didn't end in a takedown. I'll definitely consider that one day. All right. Well, in the meantime, I'm just going to sit here on these steps and enjoy my lunch. To Hollis! The one to call if we ever end up on the wrong side of the law. -Again! -Again! To Hollis! Thank you guys. Thank you so much for being my friends... My family. To Jeffrey... To Jeffrey. And to the fallen angels! Yes!
