[calming music] - I missed you. - I missed you. - So where's the family? - Hammer's on the WaveRunner. Mommy and Daddy are on the beach. Way down on the beach, you're safe. [phone ringing] - Hello? - I'm saying goodbye, man. - Gene, what's the matter? - The Fall of Rome. - Where? - Where else, Allied Cayman Bank. I just got the word, they're coming in 15 minutes. - You're joking, you're just telling me this now? You're supposed to keep me informed. - Your clients will understand. - Fuck the client, I'm talking about me. - What? - Gene, you've gotta go in and transfer my account. - I didn't know you had one. - You think I'd live in a fucking tax haven, making other cunts rich and not put something aside for myself? - If you live on the island you're not supposed to have an offshore account. How much are you in for? - Everything. Just over a million. - Jesus, I'm sorry, brother. - There are 500 banks on this fucking island, Gene. We'll be all right. Okay, Gene... [anticipatory music] [police sirens wailing] I'm looking for the prospectus for the condo property. - [Woman] Uh, I must have left it back in the office, sir. - Yeah, I bring you to Miami for two fucking hours. You bring a roller case full of fuck-knows-what and forget the most important piece-- - Allen! - Carl. - Welcome to Florida. - How's it going? - Oh, hi, you guys have a good trip in? Allen, I've been thinking it over, and I really think this is the end of it. I'm out. It's just with my daughter's 18th birthday, I'm thinking it's time to take the higher road. - Um, we can deal differently, you know, we can go into hedge funds, bonds? - No, no, no, no, that's not my style. Besides, what's all this I've been reading, you know, about the banks down there closing left and right? - They're just clearing out the riffraff, you know, the fucking cunts, and leaving the way clear for legitimate businessmen, uh, like yourself. So what are you gonna do with all the money under the mattress? - What about the condo, I invest 1.5. I don't even get a brochure? - Don't worry. I'll get my idiot secretary to fax you one as soon as we get to the island. - You should lighten up on her. - Fuck her, excuse me. - So, Pip, you're 18, you gonna get laid sometime soon? - Hey, as soon as I find a decent man. - [Woman] Good luck with that, the boys at our school? Are you serious? - Good evening, ladies. - Hi, Mr. Ridley. - Hey, Dad, you made it. - Of course. Happy birthday, sweetheart. - Thank you. Okay. - I'm so proud of you, sweetheart. We'll celebrate this weekend, okay? - Why are you leaving so soon? - Oh come on you don't want me spoiling your party. 18 years old, oh, my God!

We're just here to serve you this subpoena. We need to seize anything that might be relevant business-wise. - Consuela, get these men what they need. - [Consuela] Okay, mister. - Excuse me, I'm late for an appointment. - [Martinez] Yeah good luck with that appointment, Carl. Let's get to work, take it all. - [Man] You two, upstairs. - Five, six, seven, eight, nine. Okay, jumping jacks, and one, two, three, four, five, six and seven and down.

We'd like to welcome you to Owen Roberts International Airport in George Town on Grand Cayman Island. - Is there some other way you can get around this? - Oh, be cool cat, it's 4:15 on a Friday. Don't know where you're rushing to, man. [singing in foreign language] - It's a shrine to all the fishermen passed on. - It's all closed, man, they won't be opening till Monday. - What about Cayman Merchant? - They've been closed for the last four months man. - Pippa! - That's my father there. - Pippa! Come on, honey, we gotta go. - We weren't expecting you for several weeks, Mr. Ridley. - Yeah, I know. - I must say you have a lovely daughter. - She's not exactly digging my chili at the moment, if you know what I mean. [laughing] - Oh, goodness, yes, I have one of my own. - Yeah. Something wrong? - I only seem to have the spare key at the moment. - [Carl] Oh, that's fine, we'll come down if we need anything. - Okay, thank you, Mr. Ridley. - See you later. Thank you. Come on, Pip it's C-4. What, you're not speaking to me now? - You had this planned the whole time. - It was supposed to be a place for us to spend Christmas. A surprise. - Yeah, well, I'm fucking surprised. - Hey, you know what, look at me! Hey, we're gonna start over. It's gonna be okay. - How, everything we had was back there. - Well, I'll hire someone to pack up the house. Hey we'll get you a new car, how does that sound? - It's not about the stupid car, Dad. It's my friends, memories. Mom was buried in Miami, you can't just pack that stuff up into a box. - Honey, they were gonna take everything. - They already have. - Huh? - Oh! - Sorry um, pardon, oh. - It's 949-9211. Call me, I'm sweatin' you out here. - Dad can you have somebody come change the sheets in my room? - What's wrong? - I don't like the color. - Well, sure, sweetheart. - I'm going to the beach. - Have fun.

You don't believe me? Man, I ain't got to prove nothin' blood. Who I be's in here, who I be's? - Hey, Fritz Boy, right? Yeah, you left your wallet and your watch. - Yeah, sorry about that, sweetness shut up, y'all. I was doin' the drinking thing last night. I must've walked into the wrong condo. Or the right condo, depending on how you see it. - I guess drinking's not for everyone. - [Boy] Thanks. - [Man] I do appreciate what you've done for me, Allen. Just think about the family, man, be smart. - I am smart, for God's sake. - Mind if I chill here? - [Pippa] I'm keeping the pot you left. Call it a room charge. - Yeah, that's cool, that's cool. I can get you some more of that if you want. - I'm sure I'll have no problem finding drugs on a Caribbean island. - Cayman is a little different than America. Gotta have connections.

You have no idea, my dad has just been such a jerk. - So, are you just visiting, or, um, did your dad, start a hedge fund, fuck the boss and retire early? - Um, neither, really. - She's a lifer, definitely, you can just see it in her eyes. Welcome to our little island. - Um, do you guys know where the bathroom is? - It's over there. - This is fucked up, Eva. - She's not gonna last six months. - With Fritz, I'd be surprised if she lasts the weekend. - [Eva] Slut. - There's somebody in here. - Bitch, there's room for two.

Let's go to your house. - Pippa, Pippa? - So you cool? Yo, there's this song you need to add to the soundtrack of your life, girl.

Tonight our night, we gonna have fun, come on. - This isn't your boat. - Yeah, yo, this, this my brethren's boat. My friend, he cool with it, don't worry. It's the quickest way across the island. No worries, girl, here we go now. Here we go, ladies first, of course. Watch your step. [banging] Raw, dude, here we go now. Make yourself comfortable, girl, sit down. A little something, Cayman style. Yeah, sorry about that, I don't think they got a radio here. - [Pippa] Oh, um, I don't drink. - You sure, it's not that strong, man. To us, of course. You know, Pippa, it's so crazy, how you can meet somebody for the first time, and feel more connected to them, than the people you've supposedly known I feelin' like you're this beautiful mango. Ripe, waiting for someone to pick you. - Whoa. - Central, you on patrol? Yeah, looks like we got a burglary on Cayman. - Security hello, oi! - Shit. - [Man] You little dirty bastard, on your feet, Fritzyl - I thought this was your friend's boat. - [Man] Quite a nice Bimmer, was it yours? - [Man] All units, all units. - Jesus. - Hey, what's all this? - Oh, hey, bro, there was a shootout. Yeah, man, it's the end of an era. - [Man] In 1973, there was only one inmate in the Cayman Islands Prison. Since that time, there has been an average of one murder per year. The majority of these incidents have fallen under three categories, vehicular homicide, domestic, or drug-related, all the incidents except one. On the quiet side of the island, a group of fishermen engaged in a heated debate. The homicide was witnessed by the fisherman's seven-year-old son, who for nearly five years did not say a word to anyone. This earned him the nickname Shy. - What's up, Shy? Me and the boss takin' the boat out tonight for some deep-sea fishing. - You won't be needing me later then? - No, no, no, man. But look, I have two bookings in the morning. I want you up and at 'em. - This one here. We got this last week. You guys are gonna love it, it's brand-new. - Cheers, Marvin. - Take it easy, bro. - Good evening, sir. - Marvin. - How's it going, sir? - How are you? This kid here? He work for me? - Since high school. Daughters and the wives love him. You should see when he's working, the tip jar is full. - I'm not running some kind of match service here, man. Gentlemen. - You're home early, you can come to church with me tomorrow. - Oh Mom, I'd love to, you know, but I've gotta go to work. - You know why I go to church, to thank God for my good son. - Well, maybe you can tell that to the boss then. - Or his daughter. Oh, yeah, I've been hearing things. - Mom, church ladies aren't supposed to be gossiping. - I'm her teacher, schoolgirls do. Now, you be careful. - You know me, Mom, I'm always careful. Two carrot juice and two fish soup, please. Thank you very much. - Thank you, you're welcome very much. - Fly Guy, Shy and Kimo. - What's happening? - Snort in faith, dog. - Yo, Kimo, what's the deal with this switching chips thing? It seems kind of shady. - You mean you been here all these years and not figured that shit out yet? Look, the barter system, the sour cream and onions is the weed, and the nacho chips, that's the cash. It's a flawless system. - Very creative. - Who you talkin' about? But, yo, on a real note, check this. - Motherfucker, what'd you do? Rob the marine supply store? - No, dog, I went on the internet. Twelve-gauge is just like a flare, man. All I gotta do is file it down a little bit. - Crazy fucker, hey, go shoot Shy with that. - Oh, blood, you need to chill out on him, where my 10 dollars is? - 10 dollars for what? - For what? I went and got you weed, and I'm hungry. - Here's your 10 dollars. - Thanks. - Now get the fuck outta here. - You the handle. - And you the blade. - All right, later. [singing in foreign language] - Is that Kimo, the magnificent West Indian? - Yo, yo, dog, I have to go to school tomorrow. - I know, dog, but it's her birthday, man. It's her birthday. - You know, ain't never known a brother so pussy-whipped without gettin' no pussy. - You got a filthy mouth for such a little dog. - My dog not little though. - Scrapper. - Scrapper what? - Teeny little scrapper, teeny-weeny scrapper. - Teeny-weeny nothin', I'm liftin' trunks, see? I'm liftin' trunks, see? - Her dad's on a fishing trip, he'll be back in the morning. But if I'm not back in two hours, come call me, all right? Toss a pebble at that window, do you see it? - Why don't she just come out in the bushes and make this easier? - Kimo, this is the way it works with the nice girls. One day you'll get yours and you'll know. - I do know she turned legal about an hour ago, and you better hurry before them niggas start lining up. - Don't be turning on that ghetto stereo. - Look, man, don't be dissing my pookie, see? - You gotta take this bike and go. [calming music] Are you nervous, we don't have to do this, you know. We've got our whole lives ahead of us. - Shy, what do you wanna do with your life? - Besides marry you? - Besides marry me. Be serious. - I was being serious. I don't know, but I feel like I've got some time. I'm not in any particular hurry. - See, that's what worries me. You're four years older than me. - Three years, technically, birthday girl. - Your life has no direction. All your friends are in high school. I bet Kimo's outside right now. - Somebody's gotta keep watch. - I'm just worried that you're gonna be one of those island boys, that's just stuck on spring break. - What are you saying? I'm nothing like those boys on spring break. I've never made a pass at you, Andrea, I love you. - No, Shy... - Let's just... - I want this, I wanna do this. [calming music] I know you. [rooster crowing] - Oh, shit. - What? What, do I look like a monster? - No, baby. You're beautiful, but I gotta go. Kimo messed up again. - [Andrea] Don't go. - I've gotta, your dad'll be home. [toilet flushing] - Drea? - Just pretend like you're sleeping. Oh, shit. - Come on now, open the door. - Please, quiet down, man, your mom's sleeping. - Shit. - There's somebody in there. - Is there a man in there? - Uh. - Hammer, a man inside her room? Boy, go out and catch him, run around front! - Open the door for Daddy now. Sweetie, whatever's going on, you can talk to me. I have some people you can talk to, don't worry. [speaking foreign language] - How you been? Can I have some of this? I'll come back, Mommy. Yo, what's up, man? - I can't believe you didn't wake me up man! - What am I? Your pussy watchman? I need my eight hours. I must say though, dog, you got skills. I need to try your cologne or something. - I'm serious. I just hope she doesn't get in too much trouble, man. - Her, you need to worry about if the Hammer gonna chop you to pieces. - He's a rich boy, the worst he can do is get his dad to fire me. You know how he got that name? - 'Cause he hammers people to pieces? - No, man. Andrea hit him in the head with a hammer when he was a kid. He's got a little dent right there. - He had you runnin' though. - Only 'cause your ass didn't wake me up. - That your ride? - Yeah. - Which reminds me. - Hmm? - You owe me a bicycle now, dog. - Come on, man. Yo, we're all dogs, man, but, yo, some of us just pedigree. - Kimo! How you doin'? Hey, I'll see you at school. - Whitey boy. - Why, why doesn't he like me? - Well, you're just not from around here, that's all. It's cool. [funky music] Ah, my boy, what's happenin'? It's a day of work. - The boss not here. - Boss not here, where is he? - Hey, yo, Antoine. - Yeah, yo. Someone last night raped his daughter. - Raped her? Raped her? Yo, I've gotta go. - Bro gone mad. [anticipatory music] - When acid is added to the universal indicator, what color does it turn? - [Group] Red. - We can then neutralize the acid by adding small amounts of alkali drop by drop. And what color does it get to? - [Group] Green. - [Teacher] Now, make sure that those test tubes... - Psst, yo, Keisha. Girl, what's up with you and this tub o'lovin'? Girl, you know I got a sickness for the thickness. - Kimo. - [Kimo] Shy, what are you doin' here? - I'm looking for Andrea, have you seen her? - No, man. Oh, you come to get some more, huh? A little quickie in the washroom. - Kimo you've gotta stop saying that shit, man, you're gonna get me in trouble. - Yo, Shy, you were at my house this morning. That was you, motherfucker, I saw you. You come to my house, and you rape my sister. - No, no, no. I didn't rape your sister, man. - I saw you there. You lie to me about raping my fucking sister? - You fuck with my father's name. - I didn't rape your sister. You fuck with my family name, huh? [screaming] [bell ringing] - Break it up! Break it up! I want you, you and you to the office right now, let's go! - I don't want you to worry, baby. But you have to understand this is not a, some kind of innocent mischief. This is a serious situation here. We make mistakes. - It wasn't a mistake. - Darling, you don't understand what love is. You don't know man-woman love. I will talk to the police. I will handle all the legal concerns. - But why? - Because this boy, he come in through a window-- - I let him in. - You never let no one in your house! Eh? You let him in for what? To steal the first night of your womanhood? Am I to put bars on the window? - Shy. - I'm sorry, Mom. - What happened here, why were you here today? - I'm serious, kid, it's gangster, bro. This is, this is beyond... Once you do this, then there no coming back. - It was just some mix-up, one of the gangster kids-- - You've gotta leave this school yard stuff behind. - I know. - You know how I feel about fighting. - Don't touch this shit, I don't even want this on me, bro. - I don't pick fights, look at this face. It takes after you. Come on. - Stop it. - Hey, you the handle. - You the blade, man. [anticipatory music] - Hey, yo, for real, though, what happened with you and Hammer? I mean he can't let this shit go, move. - Yeah, that shit goes way back. He came and worked with us one summer down at the dock, trying to impress his father and all. My future brother-in-law, man, he's got a whole lot of proving to do to the world, yo. - Yeah, but he gotta be jealous too, though, man. I mean the brother not blessed with good looks. I prettier than him. In fact, he ugly, dog. - You're such a pretty boy. - Ah, move, move. - And, yo, I'm serious about that bike, dog! Yo, Hammer, what are you doing, man? This is my house. Fuck!

But you don't bring that shit near the Sterling door. - Is that why you didn't come get me from jail? - It's not a good time. - For me either. - [Andrea] No, hold on. - Andrea who's that on the phone? - None of your business. I'm here. - I need to talk to you. - Shy, this is gonna get really complicated. You cannot be in my life right now. - Eh? I can't what? What are you saying, baby? You sound so grown-up. - That's what happens when you leave someone alone. - I didn't leave you, baby. I didn't. I'd never leave you, honey. I just needed a little bit of time. - And we got plenty of that. Remember? Isn't that what you said? Take all the time you need. And when you're ready, come out from your fucking hiding place. - Andrea-- - Just not! Just not now. [sad music] [phone buzzing] - Hey, mate. I got your call, do you want to get a drink or anything?

I fantasize about making love to you. What? - No! That is not fair. I love you. - Oh, I, uh, filled out my applications for university yesterday. I'm thinking law or business, something that makes lots of money. - Stupid people make money these days, Patrick. Clever ones just help them look after it. Times have changed. - [Patrick] What do you mean? - What do I mean? I have a client in Miami, high school educated. One day some friends, and friends of friends, come along and say to him, "Would you mind very much looking after Paid cash for his trouble. And, uh, then, of course, he needs someone, to help him introduce the cash into the banking system here, invest it, hide it. Eh? So that's it, we all get little droppings. Putting a clean face on dirty money. - Dad, do you, do you not like what you do? - I'm looking for the prospectus for the condo property. - Uh, I must have left it back in the office, sir. - Yeah, I bring you to Miami for two fucking hours. You bring a roller case full of fuck-knows-what and forget the most important-- - Allen, welcome to Florida. - Good to see you. - You guys have a good trip in? - A few hiccups, this is my assistant, Sheila. - Yes, we've met. - Oh, really? - Cayman, briefly. I think it was at church right? - That's right, that's right, at church. That's right, I forgot. - You went to church? - Yeah, on my last trip I decided to go and take in some of the local experience. - It's good seeing you again. - You too. That's quite a bag you got there. You guys moving to Miami, or am I about to sign my life away? - My sincerest apologies, Mr. Ridley, but there's some stuff I need to fax you later. Some stuff I have to-- - Carl. Please. And, uh, use my home fax, easiest thing in the world. - Uh, we, uh-- - That's okay. Is this your first time to the States? - Yes, sir. - Check the office voice mail, should we talk? - You bet. Hey, I'll look forward to getting those papers. Allen, look, I've been really thinking this over, and, I think this is the end of it, I'm out. I feel it's just time to take the high road. - We can deal differently, you know. We can go into hedge funds, bonds. - No, no, that's not my style. - [Allen] What are you gonna do with all the money under the mattress? - [Ridley] What about the condo, I invest 1.5, I don't even? - Mr. Ridley's a very nice man. - Fancy him? - No, sir. - I saw you. Lingering handshakes. Well, he's very powerful. - Allen, we discussed this. - He's very rich. The more you earn, the less you keep. - Well in that case, I should've just brought in cash. Hell I could've probably gotten it for a million even. - You wanna walk into a realtor with a million dollars in cash? Didn't do a fucking thing. Say, you'd make a good team, wouldn't you? ♪ Don't you go ♪ To turn around ♪ I know the moon ♪ Hands tied us ♪ Can you find ♪ Where hides the love ♪ Breathing down - Yes, this is Mr. Allen from the Cayman Islands. Special Agent Martinez. Enforcement. Hi! How's it going? Listen thanks for getting back to me so soon. No, I was just with him yesterday, hold on. - What was the number to Mr. Ridley's condo? - C-4. Sorry. No, they're on their way now. - Uh, excuse me, sir? Are we allowed to fax bank statements? - Just fucking do it, will you! Sorry. Go ahead. Jesus, you guys work fast, don't you? [phone ringing] - Hello, Mr. Allen's office. - [Carl] Sheila, it's Carl, can you talk? - Oh, Carl, I'm so glad you called. - No, no, me first, I feel like an ass. - Sheila? - [Carl] That whole charade with your boss. - Sheila! - Hello? - Coming, Mr. Allen! Dad! You got a fax! - Take this down to the post room, get it packed up for shipping. - [Man] So why are you leaving? - Do you know the thing about the Cayman Islands? You know about the tax thing. - Enlighten me. - Years ago... 18th century, this place was just all bushes and fishermen. There was a storm. A convoy of ships was crashed on the reef, and the locals risked their lives to go out and help the passengers, one of whom turned out to be the son of King George III of England. And His Majesty was so pleased, that his son's life had been spared, that he decreed the Cayman Islands had paid their dues to the crown, and would never again have to pay taxes. Hundreds of years later, the locals took it upon themselves, to open up that privilege to the rest of the fucking world, made a fucking mint. - They fucking did, didn't they? - Yeah. That's why the roads are all paved and the streets are fucking clean. Because the locals know how to work the fucking system. That's what I want you to do, just help me work the fucking system. - How? - Well... You're a senior manager. That means you can sign off on my account, make deposits over time, on my behalf. - And where are you gonna be? - [Man] I'll let you have the house as well, I'll be offshore. - Or in prison. - I'll be rich. Rich white men don't go to prison. - I'll drink to that. - You're a good man. - Cheers. - [Man] So do you want me to tell you what we're gonna do? - Bullshit, yo. - I'm gonna take her inside. Why don't you take our boy down to see Powell. - Fuck, man. - This way, miss. - What the fuck kind of thing they dealin' with now? - So, according to this young lady, when she and the other gentleman got down to the dock, the glass on the boat was already smashed. - Who is this other gentleman? - Oh, I don't know. He got away, so we couldn't catch him. Likely some local. Mr. Allen, he's a lawyer right? [phone ringing] - Allen. Get the phone. Hello? Allen, wake up! Wake up, it's the police. - Mmm. What? Ridley, is he on the island? Yeah, okay, yeah, I'll be right there. - [Man] Allen, where are you? I left five messages. - [Wife] He called several times during the day. - [Allen] Why didn't you fucking tell me? - You're completely drunk. Remember when we first came here, we used to sit by the ocean? You liked the smell. When was the last time you smelled the ocean? - Shut up. - Turn the light off. - Get out of the fucking car. Walk. - [Fritz] What goin' on, Officer Powell? What happenin'? You know, Fritz, I been on to you for some time. Borrowing of the cars, boats, condos. I mean, I expect it from the spring breakers, but you? You live your whole life on vacation. You know what I think it is? You're a fucking whitewashed, wanna-be American. You don't fit in amongst the locals, so you leech off of the next batch of fucked-up girls, that want a fling with a little island monkey. Oi I'm talking to you, look at me. - Don't fit in? Officer Powell, my family been here six generations. Since tightropes and turtle nets. I think I can stick my dick in any piece of sexy white beef I feel is worthy... - [Powell] What you doing? - Where's your father? - Uh, I don't know. - You don't know? - Don't know where your father is? Where are you living, where are you staying? How do you not know where your father is? - We just got here, I don't know. - You don't know much, do you? - Look at you, leeching off the rich, living other people's lives. The bloody boats. - Come on! - And the cars. - Fuck you! Fuck you! - And the condos. - Allen. Jesus Christ, man, am I glad to see you. Where the hell have you been? - I'm sorry, man. - I called your office, your house. I must've left 10 messages. - Yeah I had no idea, I've just been busy. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Pippa's gone, I, I don't even know where to begin to look. - Pippa's at the police station. - The police station? - Yeah. - What happened? - She just got taken in for something. It's no big deal, she's fine, that's why I'm here. What are you doing on the island? They came at me hard, warrants, subpoenas. Barely got to the bank in time. It's a good thing you sent that fax. - Yeah, which fax? - Oh, the one yeah, Sheila sent it first thing this morning. About the condo, yeah, that is lucky. Fuck, they just, no warning, they just come down on you? That's too bad, manm I can't believe that. I thought you had connections. - Yeah, yeah, I... You said that Pippa's okay? - Yeah, she's fine. We should go and get her. - Let me just grab a couple things. Fuck! Son of a fucking bitch! - Fuck, they just, no warning? They just come down on you? Which fax? - Dad, you got a fax! - Sheila sent it first thing this morning, about the condo. Special Agent Martinez. Traveling light? - Heavy enough. Let's go. - Hey, Carl, you should put that somewhere safe, you know, if that's what I think it is. - [Carl] Let's just get to the station. I wanna see my daughter. - [Allen] Carl you're on the run from the feds. You wanna turn up at the police station with a bag of incriminating evidence? - You are a fucking adult! Act like it! Let me tell you something, Fritz. I'd better not see you even riding in a car if your name is not on the deed, understand? Not even to borrow your mum's piece of shit wagon to get groceries. Because if I find you in a car, I'm gonna beat you, and throw you in the swamp! - Yo we huntin' some imaginary people, bro. It's a nice crib though. - Sick fuck. - Fuckin' empty! I'm gon' kill Fritz, man, I'm gon' kill him! Wherever I see him, I don't care, I'm gon' kill him! - If I have to find the girl they'll have to find your body! - [Fritz] Why, dude. - [Powell] Where are my fuckin' glasses? - I don't know, I don't know. - Christ. [funky music] [gun fires] [screaming] - Shy, you're gonna kill me now? - What the fuck did I do to you, huh? I lived to love your sister, what was so fuckin' wrong with that? - Fuck you. That wasn't love. - What the fuck do you know about love, huh? Do you know what it means to love do you? Do you know what it means to look into someone's eyes, someone you love? Just to fucking look in her eyes, do you? She was so fucking innocent, man. She was so pure, and she loved me. - You fuckin' embarrassed my family, Shy. My sister had everything before she started dealin' with you. - I just saw her being fucked in a toilet! - And who's fault is that, huh? - What has she fucking got now, what does she got now? She's better off now, is she? She's fucking better off being fucked in a cubicle by some fucking stranger? - I can't stand your brethren and that's the way it is. - This didn't scar me, man. You scarred her. Fucking live with that. You fucking live with that, you. - Bloody been in here for 48 hours. I put it in first thing on Monday, cash business as usual. It's too big. - I got it. Only two people in the world know this combination, me and God. And he's too busy to remember. Don't worry, come on, let's go and find her. Put this jewelry somewhere now. - What the fuck? Is she all right? - Yeah, she's fine. - What are the charges, drugs? - There are no charges, no, no, there are no charges. - Then what are they holding her for? - Just because they've had a bit of a rough night. They've had a shooting, they've had a burglary, so they're a bit snowed under, the shit's hit the fan tonight for some reason. - [Man] Hi, Andrea. - Have you seen him? - [Kid] Yeah, man, we saw him down by the dock just now. Dock by the dock, without a doubt, yeah. [foreboding music] - So you come to the Cayman Islands, and you don't even call me? - I should be horsewhipped. Where's Allen? - He left with them. - Courtesy of a grateful nation. For you and your family. - Thank you. - There'll be a lot of questions asked. Where the money went, where it came from. Who betrayed whose client. Cayman police are gonna come looking for you. - God bless America. [foreboding music] - Sweetheart? Are you okay? - Daddy. - They treat you all right? - Extradition time, Carl, vacation's over. - What? - Carl? - [Carl] One minute. - [Martinez] Hold up. - I gotta go off with these guys for a while. - What happened? - I fucked up, baby. I fucked up. I wish I could say something that would make it all right, but I can't. - What? - You'll be okay, you'll see, it'll be okay. Baby, you're so beautiful. You'll be okay, it's okay. Listen just look to your memories. It's all you'll ever need. I love you so much, do you know that? - Gotta go. - Please! - Take him back. - Please! Goddamn it! - No, no, it's gonna be all right. I want him in my car. Can't just come to these islands and exploit these people. They don't deserve it. Baby... - Mr. Allen, why are you? - Thanks for coming down. Sheila, keep the car. - Come on, sweetie. I'll look out for you. - I've been looking for you all night. I lost my way, and I'm sorry. Baby, I really needed you. It's just that, you're my heart. And when you broke, I broke down with you. I wanna be with you, Shy. I don't care what my father thinks. I don't care what Hammer thinks. I care about you. - You don't know. - Know what? - Fuck you, Shy, huh? I'd rather my sister be a whore in the fucking streets than fuck with you! [gun fires] - Fuck it! I'm sorry. - Patrick? - You're on the clock. - Yeah. Patrick! - Hey. Listen to me. That piece of ass you call a secretary is at the station right now making herself a deal. So you have a choice, you pack your shit and meet us here in five minutes, or your family's gonna be visiting you in prison. - It's all right, I'm traveling light. - Yeah, 28 pounds. - What? Pardon? - Don't you remember what you asked me, Allen? In Miami? - You want to walk into a realtor with a million dollars in cash? Do you have any idea how much that would weigh? - A million dollars. 100 dollar bills. 28 pounds. - [Martinez] Chop chop! - Where have you been? Don't do that to me again, okay? Talk to me, I've been so worried. - You ready come on, we've got to go! - Fuck, Allen! - Fuck! Fuck! Oh, no. You, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking! Shit!
