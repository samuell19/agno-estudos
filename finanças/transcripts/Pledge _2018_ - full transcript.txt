What does that mean, "Act natural"? Derek! Derek! Derek, there you are, you bitch. How you doin'? - Do I know you? - Yeah. I am, uh.. Ah, you remember we met, uh.. You're the admin for the group. You're on the group, the rush group? I'm David. What's good with you? Hey, guys. Ah, you guys rushing? No, no, we're just, we're just checking it out. You guys, um, hear anything about the pledging? Uh, no, no. We didn't... We didn't hear anything. You know, I doubt they're gonna let anybody haze anyway after last year. I just heard it was gonna be like a lot of drinking maybe some weird naked shit. Uh, sorry, what weird naked shit? I'm up for anything. Is that like your thing? - Weird naked shit? - No. What? Do you... do you... do you.. What about, what about Kristen? I had her good last night, man. - No way! - Yeah. Oh, how'd you meet her? Wh... where'd you meet her? Did you meet her here? I'm not saying I wouldn't be into naked.. Listen to a conversation for once in your life. - Alright, take it down a notch. - Are you kidding me right now? Nice meeting you guys, I'm gonna go. Yo, it's alright, man. - That's awesome. - Cool, man. Y'all, I'll catch you guys a lil' later. I'm gonna get a drink. You got drinks in the back? Yeah, alright, I'm gonna get a drink. - Hey, how are things going? - I'm being very natural. - Okay, alright. - Very, very poorly. Ah, yeah, I'm kinda having that problem too. I don't know, my jokes, they're not landing. - Wow, shocker. - Hey, Daniel. It's David. Yeah, um, this is a closed rush party, man. Okay, if we did something wrong we'd love constructive criticism. Please just tell us, we wanna know. Please don't tell us, I don't wanna know. I'd like to, we'd like to. You're just not the right.. You guys are weird. - We're weird? - Yes. - We're weird? - Yes. Well, that's.. We're weird? - Yes. - We're weird? The sixth time and still... He's weird? You're saying he's weird? I'm getting sick of this, let's go. Let's give 'em the beer, get 'em the hell out of here. I don't want your fucking beer. David, just take the beer.. - It's okay. - You're gonna regret this. - Get outta here. - Big time, big time. Thank you for your hospitality. Fuck Beta, let's go to that other part.. What is that? What, are you mad at me? Oh, no, I love being humiliated! Oh, my God. Look, I threw a Hail Mary! I took a big risk, you know and I wanted to make it happen for us. I don't think that's so bad. Can we just go to this girl's party and forget about that frat? - It's so not worth it. - There is no party, man! It's clearly a prank. Alright, fine, a prank by her would be amazing. I would love to be pranked by a girl like that. Look, let's just, let's go back to the dorm we'll get drunk, alright? Obviously, this night's not working out. - Thank you. - But that's not.. It's not just tonight. If we go home and we, and we just give up that's the next four years. That's just us drinking and playing Xbox and doing nothing for the rest of college. That doesn't sound bad. That sounds way better than someone making fun of me every time I walk through their door. David, I can't even get this address anymore. I mean, can you read that? What do you want me to... I know the address, so don't worry about the address. I got that in my head. It says nothing, I mean, what if we can't find this place? If we can't find the place, I will call a cab immediately. Right away, okay? You'll pay for the cab? Of course, I'll pay for the cab. You'll get me an egg cream on the way home? I was gonna buy you an egg cream no matter what. - Can we go? - Yeah, fine. - Alright. Yeah. - I'm in. - Thank you. - Okay, last chance, man. Yes, that's all I'm asking for. Alright, guys, I think, uh.. This is, um, this is it. What is this? It's a driveway. - With grass? - Yeah, with grass. Come on. Guys, this is just a prank, I'm going to sit down. No, do not sit down. It is impossible to get you up when you sit down, let's go. Would you pl.. Oh, goddamnit. Ow! Ow! Fucking ticks. D-David? Oh, my God, does that look like a prank? That's the best prank in the world. - Uh, yeah. - Come on, let's go. Come on. - It's amazing! - Hey, hey, that. Look at that. - She's really cute! - Yeah. Oh, man! - I would love to meet her. - Yeah, this is good. I think this is the best I'll do, you know? Well, give yourself some credit. You know, they're kinda, like, better from afar so we don't mess it up. That's what I'm saying exactly, yeah. When you get close and then you disappoint and you have to talk and you have to like impress them. Is it weird that I'm aroused? I'm also very sweaty, I think... - Hey, guys! - Oh! - Hey. - Whoa! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spook ya. Yeah, so... sorry, we thought it was an a... abandoned house. No. No, not quite. Okay. You wanna join us? - Yeah! - Yes, yes, definitely. - Yeah. - Definitely, yes. I think that'll be really good. We, we're not doing, I think we're free. Thank you, sir, bless your heart. You're a really good guy, I won't let you down. - I'm Ricky, by the way. - I'm Ethan, thank you. - I'm Justin. - Great. - I, ah.. - Great, here. - Oh!

Do anyone of you like Scotch? Oh! Oh, man. What is that, liquid brick? How's rush week going, man? - Yeah, it's, you know. - Huh?

There's a method to my madness. I'll do it. I'll.. You could introduce me, I'll... - Yeah? - Yeah. Ladies, please, meet Sam, Ben, David. Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - I'm Stacey. - How's it going? You look like my little brother. Thank you. Th... thank you for saying that. - Anybody wanna do a shot? - Shots? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yes, please. - I'll do shots. - Shots are my middle name. Anyone want a special shot? I'll.. I'd like, I'd like that. - Yeah? You? - I'd like that. What's a special shot? - That's a special shot. - Oh! Pleasure's all you, bro. How many special shots are we doing here? Um, o... okay. See, I didn't realize that, Stacey, you were not specific 'cause if he's doing... - Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! Are we doing another special shot? Or is that the last... Drink your fucking shot, David. Oh! - Ooh! - Whew! - Whoo! Yeah. - Alright, come on, boys. - There's more party to be had. - Okay. - Alright! - You're welcome. - I'll see you later, right? - Whoa! Awesome, man! And you, talk to you later. Bye! Enjoy the party. - David, come on, man. - A hundred percent. I will do that. Yeah. Yeah. Your shirt is so soft! Thanks, it's my favorite. This is so amazing. - You should.. Not now, man. - This is so amazing. This is so.. Hi, I'm David, I'm David. - She doesn't care. - No, but it's okay. Oh, yeah, this one. - Don't touch the fucking... - Sorry. I thought I told you not to touch the door. - I'm sorry, Ethan. - Uh, I... I'm sorry! No, it's, uh, it's my fault. I... I... I asked her to show me where the bathroom is. - Uh, I apologize. - That's great, it's fine. Yeah. Don't worry about it, it's just, you know we keep our valuables down there, and so.. - Don't touch the door. - Okay. - Everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. You guys want a drink? - Yeah. - Great! Cool, lead the way. Why don't you show him where the drinks are? We have to kick you guys out, sorry. Yeah, we need to crash. It's morning time. - I really thank you. - Wild night. - Did you have fun? - Come on, boys. Alright, sure. I mean, I hope we didn't overstay our welcome and all. I really appreciate your having us. What are you guys doin' tomorrow? Nothing, why? We really like you guys. We think you might be club material. Well, that... that's really great. - We really like you, too. - This was so much fun. Good, so, uh, pack a bag and we'll see you tonight at 8:00. So is this like a, is this like a bid? Eight o'clock. - Alright. - Okay. Dude, you told us to get dressed two hours ago. Why are you still getting packed? 'Cause it takes a very long time to get me to look this good, alright? Hey, do you think those girls are there a lot? Yeah, are you kidding? They're probably there all the time. It's an amazing house. My question is, does the club own a yacht? Because I've always wanted to get a blow job on a yacht. I think maybe you should focus on, you know like kissing a girl or just a regular blow job first. Guys, if we had a house like that the girls would definitely come to us. Alright, this whole thing could be pretty fun. It's going to be incredible. Hello? - David? - Hello? - Just go in their house? - I don't know how. Hello? - Okay. - Are we, uh, are we early? Wow. Guys? Welcome, gentlemen. Hi, Max, did you get much sleep? Put the bags on the floor and get in line. The three of us were talking last night. We realized we might have given you the wrong idea about our club. You see, our club is not about beautiful women and drugs. No, those are by-products. By-products of a singular focus. You see, the Crypteia produces the best. Each and every member dominates his field. Advertising, tech, finance. So, if you pledge today, yes there are gonna be beautiful women and lots of parties, but more importantly you're gonna have a future so fucking bright that you're gonna need sunglasses every time you look in the mirror. Have I cleared this up? - Yeah, that sounds good. - That sounds good. I think the word he was looking for is, "Yes, sir." - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Uh.. - Oh, no, no, no. You will speak once you're spoken to. Yes, sir. - You had a question. - Yes. Uh, is... is there gonna be more pledges or is... is this it? I don't think you're hearing me, Sam. You see, this club is exclusive. There are never more than ten active members on campus at any time. You're at the doorway to the elite. But that doesn't mean you won't have to work for it. You see, privilege comes with hard work comes with... sacrifice. So are you ready to pledge? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Louder, our members don't mumble! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Are you ready to be kings of the campus? - Yes, sir! - Do you have what it takes? - Yes, sir! - Louder! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! One more time! - Yes, sir! - Good! Over the next 48 hours, you will be tested physically, mentally emotionally. Make us proud. We're in this together. - Phones, now. - What? Come on, everybody, in the bag. O... okay. Line up! Alright, so, every year, we pick a class president. Uh, who'd would like to volunteer? I could do it, I mean, I was very active in high school politics. Great! I resign as president. Well, as president, I'm gonna need you to make a decision here. Right, um, I resigned. Do we brand you or everybody else? I think there's some confusion here. Time's up! What the fuck? What the fuck? You're gonna have to think faster than that, cocksuckers. Indecisiveness will get you hurt. David, you had a perfect opportunity and you messed it up. You see, guys, that is exactly what you have this weekend a perfect opportunity to go through 48 hours of hell. Yes, mind you, but still come out on top. Right, Paul Blart? Who's next? You just said that if he got branded the rest of us didn't have to do it. That was only if he made a decision. I'm gonna need you to lean forward for me. No, man, I'm not doing that, I'm not doing that. - It's quick, guys. - Ricky, come on, man. There's gotta be another way. Somethin' else, you know? Sorry, bud. Can I pick the spot? Sure, man. Okay. Just like... right there, okay? Can... can you give me a countdown? Yeah, sure, one. - Oh, God! - That's so fucked up! Oh, my God! - I'm not doing this? - Oh, my God! I can't do this. I can't do this. Oh, come on, we're gonna brand you for all the right reasons. I'm not gonna do it. It's not a walk-on, boys. If I don't even get picked, then I'm just branded. I don't want this! - Turn around! - This is fucked up. - I, I can't do this. - Shh. It's either cheek... or cheek. Ah, just come on, just do it quick. Just do it quick. Ah.. Say, "Thank you, President David!" Oh, God, thank you, President David. Cute butt! Fuck! Fuck! - Beautiful. - Alright, time out. This isn't happening. Pause, guys. - How about you, Spike Lee? - David, Justin, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm... I'm through with this. Stop, wait, please, please. Calm down, calm down, calm down. - I wanna go home. No. No. - Calm down. Okay. Ricky, please, I just wanna go home. Sorry, I'm... I'm... I'm through with this. Alright, you can go. - Give me your word. - Okay, okay. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Thank you, Ricky. I appreciate it. No, no, oh! - And you! - No! Okay, great. Cool off. Dinner's in five. We're having pork chops! Fuck. He said it would be five seconds. It's way more than five seconds. Guys, it's... it's just hazing, it's just hazing. Okay. I know it fucking sucks, I know. I... Look, I've heard of way worse. You've heard of fraternities that brand people? Yeah, sure, sure! My brother told me that at his frat the president chopped a pledge's finger off one time. That's not hazing, that's fucking torture. This... this doesn't happen at a fraternity, okay? We need to contact the authorities. It's not a fraternity, you know, it's a social club so let's just keep that in mind. Come on, guys, look, when he comes back in I'm saying somethin', we're going home. No, you're not, okay? What the fuck are you talking about? I didn't come here to get branded and leave! David, take a look around. We're all hurt, okay? We can't keep doing this for 48 hours. Look at him! No, you're not saying a word, I swear to God! - Don't fucking blow it! - I won't.. Hey! That was fucking crazy. You all okay? That was shitty, Ricky. I know. But when you're pledging, it's supposed to be shitty. Right. Look, guys, I hate this as much as you do but if we wanna get there, we have to keep to tradition first. Come on, man, I can't do this. I... I can't do that, man. Hey. Justin, come on, man. Look.. It's getting too intense, let me know. I'll make 'em ease up. Okay? Come on, come on. Rachel. Rachel, don't go. She probably just stayed over. Rachel! Just wait till it's over. In line, gentlemen. Take your positions. On your knees. Now! Bowls. Oh, my God. Oh, that doesn't.. We have prepared something very special. Oh! Smells good, doesn't it? - Bret's quite the chef. - Oh! Gotta love the seasoning. Oh. Bon appetit, boys. Uh, I'm... I'm sorry, um, what's in this exactly? What does this have to do with the club? Just eat the soup. He's just looking for a little context 'cause, you know, we're gonna eat it. - Max gave you an order. - Bret. Look, guys, this is part of tradition, okay? The Crypteia's been doing this for centuries. Yeah, but this college isn't even.. We're looking for your breaking point, gentlemen because great men don't have one. So show us what kind of men you are and eat the soup. - Now! - Let's go! Eat it! With your fingers and hands! Get your fucking mouth in there! There you go, come on, pick up the pace a little bit. Show a little life! You like that, you little pussy? - Fucking eat the soup! - Come on, eat it! Now, now, now! Swallow it! I wanna see it all over your hair! You know what, if any of you spit out this fucking soup on my table I swear to God, I will fucking bury you! You know, your brothers have prepared this wonderful meal for you and you wanna spit my own food out on my table? Everybody on the floor now! Crawl! Crawl like the little bitches you are! - Go, go, go! - Nose and toes, gentlemen. Nose and toes right fucking now! - I don't do knees. - Get on your elbows! - Are you fucking stupid? - No. Shut the fuck up. Are you fucking stupid? - Yes. - Shut the fuck up! Are you fucking stupid? Are you stupid? - Do you want me to... - Shut the fuck up! Jesus Christ! Get him, get him. Tighten it, tighten it, tighten it! You are such a stupid asshole. I must be doing something wrong 'cause every single one of you deserve to fucking die and instead, I have to sit here and take care of you! - How do you like that? - Whoo! - You fucking love it! - Oh! - Oh, fuck! - Shut up. Do you fucking love it? Damn it, what the fuck is wrong? Why do we always get the fucking losers? What the fuck is wrong with us? Beat him, beat him. - Shut the fuck up! - Whoo! - Shit! - That is fucking disgusting. Did you just fucking vomit on my goddamn floor? Did you fucking vomit? You motherfucker. Yeah. Get in there, nice and clean, Mr. Mop and Glo. Okay, everybody, on your feet, let's go! Get the fuck up! Get the fuck up, through the door through the fucking door, go! Let's fucking go, you fat fuck! Max, Ricky, open up! Where's Stacey? Ricky, tell me where she is. I know she's here. I haven't seen her since yesterday. Have you heard? So, uh, Bret, if you wouldn't mind doing the honors.. We've prepared a very lovely place for you all to sleep. Oh, and, uh, I need to get this chair right.. Gentlemen, your new bedroom. Why don't we start with you? It's not quite a hotel room but I think it'll serve its purpose. Come on. Now, I expect you all to get some really good rest and in the morning, be sharp and ready to go for more of the pledging. Sound good? Excellent. Oh, uh, watch out for the rats in the back. Fuck. The floor's actually not so uncomfortable. David, shut up. The light will be a problem, but I can lie on this floor. David, shut up. - I could... I could... - David, shut the fuck up, man. This is your fault we're here. Now, what the fuck is that supposed to mean? Are you kidding me right now? This was all your idea. You brought us here. You got us branded, you did all this shit. It's your fault. Oh, this is my fault? You didn't want to be here? No, man! I didn't wanna do any of this shit! And you know what? I would have said me. What the fuck does that mean? When they asked to brand you or everybody else.. ...I would've said, I would've said me. I mean, who doesn't, who doesn't say that? Okay, that's ridiculous. They didn't give me a chance to say.. ...to say anything. Hey. - What is this? - Tequila. Enjoy. Look, I think my burn's infected, man. Can I get out? - I'll let 'em know. - No, seriously. Hey! The Crypteia is dedicated to finding and training the future leaders of our great nation. Formally established in 1852 the club boasts traditions that date back to ancient Sparta. Our members include heads of industry, politicians and other brave men who drive progress. Wow, talk about an alumni network. Of all the animals, the Crypteia celebrates the rat. While most regard the rat as a lowly creature one should not overlook its most valuable trait tunnel vision. If a rat is hungry, if it truly wants something it will tear through any obstacle be it dirt, brick, flesh, or even wood. If you value your goal, you could do the same. Think you have what it takes? Bust a gut and keep moving out. The Crypteia is dedicated to finding and training the future leaders of our great nation. Formally established in 1852.. ...the club boasts traditions that date back to ancient Sparta. - Hi. - Hi. Wow, talk about.. Good morning, pledges! So, tell me, boys, how'd you sleep? Did you, uh, stay away from the rats? How long have we been in here? Well, you've been here for, uh, 12 hours. My burn's infected, I need to go. You know, I think we can get that taken care of, actually. Oh, yes, we can! Come, right this way. Alright, pledges, right this way. Gentlemen, please have your seats. Hey, Max, man, is there any way I could get just, like, a pretzel or something? Yeah, sure, I'll get you something to eat. Don't worry, I've taken good care of you so far. Ethan, you're my golden boy. Why don't you take this golden seat? I am terribly sorry for the way you've been treated so far. It's all part of the hazing process so there's nothing to worry about, okay? Now, I have someone very special that will help you know, lift your spirits, alright? What do you say, guys? Can I get a little excitement? Come on, give me some excitement! Okay, clap, there we go! Okay, so, cue music. Gentlemen.. ...for you. - Ooh! - Oh, man. Oh, my gosh! I got enough of a hard-on to go around. - Ooh! - Oh! - It wasn't cheap! - God damn. I'm happy my legs are crossed. Woo! - Woo! - Oh.. Oh.. - Woo! - Oh.. Oh, man! Ow! Damn. Oh, man. Yeah! Come on, heartthrob. - Woo! - Fuck. College, guys, am I right? Ethan, uh, you're injured. Would you mind terribly? - I'm okay. - No, no, no, no, no. It's fine. It's on us, really. You know, she's here to do her job. - Thank you. - Really, I'm okay. Don't worry, she's gonna make sure you're back in tip-top shape. I'm sure you know.. Yeah, just be careful. Oh, that looks infected. That's better. Thank you. - Oh, my God. - Oh, yeah, round two, baby. Hey, we're not paying extra for that. Rachel? Run. Yeah! Fuckin'.. That was awesome, right? Alright, boys, you sit tight I'm gonna get you some snacks. And you said you wanted pretzels, right? Great. Guys. Shh, come here. We have to go now. You're gonna mess it up for all of us. No, you can pledge without us, okay? We need to leave. Okay, can you just tell me what's happening? I will tell you outside. We have to go. This is a bad idea. We're almost done here, guys. Are you sure? Because I think staying here is a real bad idea. - It's just hazing. - Yeah, this is what frats do. David... this isn't a frat. We have to go. Are you coming? Yeah, I'm coming. - Okay, let's go. - Alright. Let's go. Shh. What the fuck? Where are you going? - Why is the door locked? - Uh.. Max didn't want any more girls showing up, so.. We were gonna go get some food. We were feeling... We're leaving. Come on. You're almost done. Hey, look, Ethan's really hurt and he needs to see a doctor or a nurse. You know, I think, like, a nurse with an actual medical degree and not just a outfit. If you leave, that's it. You're out. You get that, right? Yeah. I'm sorry. Let's just.. Let's get your phones, your bags.. - And cab home on me. - Thank you, but I'd rather go. - We need to get our phones. - Why do we need our phones? Fuck it, I'll get a new one.
