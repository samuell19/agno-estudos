A foreigner who looked like Christ came to her Madame took his money Chin-hua believed it's him She even dreamt of Christ giving her a treat Christ said if I finished all the dishes I'd be cured What an appetite I'd got Remember that half-breed reporter? You'd have seen him The one who stayed at the same hotel as we in Shanghai He said he's some special corespondent Heaven's beautiful, with round columns Christ sat on a high rose wood chair Behind him there's water's glow, water's sound I also heard someone punting You just dreamt of returning to Qinhuai, silly Now I'll fry a real fried egg Such array for frying an egg!

When I'm well, I'll buy a new dress, so you'll see how pretty I am What do I come back for? If I hadn't come back, Chin-hua wouldn't be so upset If I hadn't left, she wouldn't believe that man's Christ So she's cheated, well just let her dream on Isn't that happier? Don't blame youself too hard If only we could die together I seem to remember you've written Even it the gods were unfortunate., they couldn't commit suicide together with us Right? Right? Take your medicine, the Japanese mister told you to take more fruit See who you'd believe in Go on being sick, later on people not only won't see you They won't come to Lotus House at all To me, sorrow is even more unbearable than anxiety Headache again?

I'll go and talk to Chin-hua Okagawa, I'll look after Chin-hua here for you She's always wanted you to find her pretty If you stay to see her die, that's even more cruel I want her to know I love her She knows I love her more than Christ does What about your family in Japan? They trust you What if you bring Chin-hua back to Japan? I've said in my letter, even if we can't be together for life At least I want to cure her disease If you feel obliged by this promise Then go in peace Chin-hua didn't know you only came back to take her to Japan for treatment She relied on others to read letters to her Nobody had read her this sentence What did you say? So what if she goes to Japan? In Japan she can be treated She's ill, she's ill She's ill, she's ill She's ill Feeling cold? I'm well, no need to follow you to Japan You can go.

No, there's still time Let's stroll Pull over there and wait for us Remember what we're to do? We remember, one after the other Good, and do you remember the song I taught you yesterday? Yes, the Jesus Love Me song Good, sing together for me Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so Little ones to him belong, they are weak but he is strong Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me Yes, Jesus loves me, Bible tells me so - Jesus gave his life for love, so my sins he may remove - Chin-hua Christ and me, which one do you belive in?
