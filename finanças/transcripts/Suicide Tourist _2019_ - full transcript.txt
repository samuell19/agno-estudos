My name is Max Isaksen. Today is January 10th, 2019. When you watch this... ...I will be dead. Max? My name is Karen. Come on in. Here are the papers. It is fine. Thanks. - I need to ask for your cell phone. - Yes. Wallet too? - Yes. - Okay. THE MAN WITHOUT FUTURE Good morning, Max. And happy birthday I hope you had an optimal night's sleep. Please rate it on a scale of one to ten Six. Please rate your physical well-being on a scale of one to ten Five. Thanks, Max. You have a personal reminder "Practice rhyme." Episcopal plaster. Short jaws barely crack. Five flat cream buns... ...on a flat cream bun surface. Hundred pounds, dog pounds, dog wool. Thank you, Max. Have a good day! I have to sit here. Congratulations! - You have been busy. - No, nonsense. You are sweet. Come. Here you go. - Cheers. - In cabbage (Danish rhyme) Oh, it's strong! It is healthy at least. I need to meet Erik in the office today. Do you need to start working again? I'm really glad to hear that. - Don't you also... - Yes, after the scan this afternoon. Alice, I'm really sorry. If only I could do something - - but we can't pay out life insurance - - if we're not 100% sure, that your husband, Arthur, is dead. Of course, he's dead. Half a year ago, yesterday, that Arthur disappeared. You are my insurance company. Isn't that what I pay you for? Do you hear what I'm saying? Yes... Look here, Max. Your tumor has grown significantly. It cannot be operated. It is simply too dangerous. So that's not very good news. At all. What about the dietary changes and monitoring with the app? - I've been fine. - I know it's tough. Have you had no other symptoms besides speech difficulties? No. You need to be aware that a tumor that size can change your life. So Max, if there's anything you really want to do, do it now. Everything still ok? Everything is fine. ðŸ˜˜ Sorry. I should talk to my sister. - Happy Birthday. - Thanks. And congratulations to us. We need to travel. - Cheers. - Cheers. The first week we should stay at the "luxury lodge", And then today I talked to that "shark cage diving" company you talked about. You can do it. There is only room for one, so I sacrifice myself for your sake. You're not happy at all. I am, I'm so happy. I'll mimic all the savannah animals, if you don't smile right now. Excuse me. That's better. Cheers. - What are you having? - I don't know. What about you? Whatever you decide. No, it's your birthday. You decide. Exactly. Then we need scallops and asparagus and mango compote. It sounds delicious. Is there something wrong? LÃ¦rke, there's something I need to tell you. I know. Erik called me, when you didn't show up today. Yes... I just couldn't get my mind off it. I understand that. I'm going to the bathroom. You have a personal reminder. "Practice rhyme" Episcopal plaster, short jaws... Yes. He shut himself in completely. I'm trying. I don't know how long I can hold on Yes. Okay. We'll talk to you tomorrow Max? Here you go. You have a wardrobe over there. You can put on your old clothes in that bag there. There is also some outerwear, if you want to go out. I see that I have set your starting time for tomorrow, 1pm. Then you have time too to sleep for a long time. Have a sit. I'll get someone to send you some food. - I'm sorry. - Don't apologize. I think you're doing really, really well. I'll check on you in a bit. Okay? It will be good. I promise you I know. It's just the emotions. It's so overwhelming I feel so ungrateful. After everything that you're doing. Don't do that. - Good morning, Max. - Good morning. I'm sorry for crying like this. We're so fortunate. We should enjoy it, shouldn't we? A friendly face. - I'm Ari. - I'm Max. Max. Nice to meet you, Max. So, what are you supposed to talk about around here? Maybe not the future. Are you hungry? Yes, I'm starving. I hope there's something crazy on the menu. Feel how the breath enters your body. Where it is the most present. Your nose. Your chest. Your gut. Breathe. Pay attention to your breath. Feed your attention in to your mind. Breathe. In and out. Breathe. Pay attention to your breath. Breathe. In and out. Breathe - A circle? - No. A snake? A sun? No. A spider? A layer cake. - The one you made for my 40's. - Now. Just my next guess. You only get one. I know. Should I make coffee for you? Yes, please. Thanks. Don't forget the coffee. Thanks. LÃ¦rke? What? Excuse me? Do you have a moment? - Do you know how to make a knot? - Yeah, what kind of knot? Well... It just has to hang something in it. Yes. This is the standard loop. Around there. - And it's strong enough? - Yes. How much should it be able to carry? 92 kg, more or less. - Well, it can hold that easily, so... - Thanks. Simba. Yes? It's Alice Dinesen. You have to excuse me for contacting you in such a way, but it's important. I've found proof that Arthur is dead So I thought, do you have the time to come by? - Do you want milk or sugar? - No. This is fine. Thanks. Arthur... ...often talked about suicide, but... He somehow always found a way out of that mindset, so... My name is Arthur Dinesen Today is January 7, 2018. I hereby confirm that I, of my own free will, And with assistence of this hotel and its staff, Have decided to take my life today. When you watch this, I will be dead Honey... I don't know, how it ended up like this... ...but it did. And that's for the best. You know I love you You also need to know, There was nothing, you could have done or said, which would've made me feel better. I know you hate it, seeing me like this, But it's over. I want you to remember all the good... - How did you get the video? - It came in here. There is also a telephone number with a voicemail. I called and left a message, but they have not called back. Isn't the video proof enough in itself? Maybe it is. I have to to look into it... ...but this is really nice, this. Yes. Well thanks. You might think this is for the money, but it's not. It's not about life insurance anymore. It's about finding the truth. I need someone to tell me that it's over. This is the Hotel Aurora.

Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes, I think so. - Good. Max, wasn't it? - Yes. - Lovely. We're neighbours, then. I'm Jenny. I'm okay again. Sometimes I just get a bit upset, and that's when I have my doubts. Tell me, Max... You think you'll meet the ones you love on the other side? You think they're waiting, like in the films? - I'm a bit tired, so... - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm babbling. That's me. I'll leave you in peace now. Jenny? - It was nice meeting my neighbor. - Thank you. This way. So... Because of the permafrost, I don't recommend an old fashioned burial. But I can recommend freeze drying instead, It's eco-sustainable. Of course we also have our more exclusive services. The "Circle of Life" is our most popular one. Perhaps your parting councillor told you about it? So... Simply put, It means that your earthly remains feed a plant of your choosing. Just regular cremation, And a white urn. The biodegradable one? Sure. LET IT OUT I just wanted to tell you... That this is the right decision for me. This is the... Sorry, man. - Wow, eh? - Yes. This is it, Max. This is my last night. Fuck, I should be frightned, is all, but I am not. Good. It's weird... Can I ask you something? Sure. Do you like yourself? Like, um... Do you enjoy your own company? Ok I've... Life... It gets better. Then it gets worse. But when you... When you can't fucking stand yourself, you know? What's the point? What is the point? Can I trust you, Max? Of course. Hey... Max, this is poppy tea. It's better with, um, sugar and lemon. - Poppy? - Opium. Yeah, have some lemon. Cheers. I don't feel anything. You will. I would like a drink. A drink that... blows my mind. Make it two. I will be dead in two days. How about you? I'm staying. I work here. Stand-in. Oh. Who do you stand-in for? Mum. - I usually play someone's mum. - Wow! I think that's the most beautiful thing I... I'm... I'm sure you are a loving mother... But I think you are too... ...sexy. You know, they keep telling me, I'm too old for that job. It's either the whore or the madonna. Men are that simple. You know, I do an impeccable Marilyn Monroe. - Some like it hot. - They do. It's either orgasm, or in their mother's arms. It's distressing, really, how a whole gender can be so unimaginative. A bit of variety could make this job... ...a lot less bloody boring. Max? Come on, you should see this. You should see this. Look at this. Where have you been, Max? I've figured it out, right? It's okay. We're gonna be okay. We're just gonna breathe, man. Just breathe. Max? You're not allowed to be here. You have to leave. Let's go. Yes... I've brought hot tea and sandwiches, And a stiff drink to wash them down with. Fine. - Would you like some? - Okay. There you are. - Cheers. - Cheers. I don't know what to make of it, Max. Being here. I don't know what I'm supposed to say or think. When I start to speak, I stop myself and I ask: "Is this really what you want to say, when you've only got 24 hours left?" Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'm wasting precious time. It's difficult... ...not to think all the time. What do you most feel like doing right now? Dancing. I want to dance! I don't really dance that well. - Hi. - Hi. I made food. Yes, I can see that. What is it? There are scallops, and then there is a little asparagus and mango compote. We were spoiled for our last dinner, so I wanted to try again. Don't you seem a little strange? - Are you sure you're okay? - No. There's something I need to tell you. LÃ¦rke... Damn! It is my sister. I have to take it. Yes, good... Now please open your eyes and look at me. I now think you are capable of letting it all go. You love her. You want to protect her. - That's why you've taken control yourself, right? - Yes. I can see in your journal, the only thing missing is a lawyer. Do you feel otherwise ready for tomorrow? Yes... I was wondering if I... could still change the plan? Of course. We just have to inform Frank first. Max! Come on down. Here. Have a sip. It's good. You know, Max? I had a special someone back home too. And sadly, she died. It wasn't pretty. She begged and begged to be allowed to leave, but no one listened. The doctors didn't listen. I didn't listen. Most of the time she was in some other world. She was such an amazing woman... And at the end of the day, she couldn't tell the difference between me and the dog. She deserved a better ending. - I'm not sure I understand... - Why I tell you this? Yes. When you've got a tumor... I can understand why you'd want to leave with a bit of dignity. As painlessly as possible. The clock is ticking, Max. I know, but I... I really need to see LÃ¦rke again. There must be a way. It's not an option, Max. You know the rules. Let's meet again soon. I'm sure we can work something out. And I'm sure we can get you that goodbye you need. I'm ready tomorrow. I promise, Karen. I'll be good. I can do it tomorrow. Please Max! - Help me! I don't want to. - Come with me. Move! My name is Max Isaksen. Today is January 10th, 2019. I hereby confirm that I, of my own free will... And with the assistance of this hotel and staff, Have decided to take my own life today. When you watch this, I will be dead. LÃ¦rke... I wish it could have been just you and me together. The only thing I can give you, is that I'm leaving while I'm still me. I hope and I believe you understand. Okay. Hi, Max. I wanted to wish you a good journey. All is ready. And you get it just as you wanted. Okay? What's happening here? - Hi. Let me take your jacket. - Thanks. I made food. What is this? Scallops and then some asparagus and some mango compote. LÃ¦rke, there's something I need to tell you. The scan showed that... ...the tumor has grown. It keeps growing. From now on, it will be... ...really, really bad. I can't... So now... Now it ends. Turn around. LÃ¦rke? What's up, Max? Hey. Get out. Get out. Go. Did he take it? Good. Thank you. LET IT OUT It's Arthur. There is no use, you see? You can go, you know? But you can't escape. Max! Max! Max, come back! Go the other way! May I give him a hug? Yes, he can handle a little hug. Ouch. Wherever you go, I'll be there. Do you promise? I'm not going anywhere. No, we're not sending a postcard to a cat. Thanks. Would you like some dessert? What is it? Isn't it very cold? Nah. Max, what's the matter? What are you doing here? Max? Max, look at me. Hey. Max. I think we should go to the hospital. Let's just go home. Let's just go home. Okay.
