A MINUTE OF SILENCE Wait! Wait, I say! Wipe your eyes! Wipe your eyes, I say! Well, let's raise the knife! Pick up the knife! - Who is it? - This is Sidorov. - Drunk? - No, he's always like that. And I'll cut it! Do you understand or not? I will trim you! - You didn’t lie in the ground, - Well, what should I do? I was lying! - Maybe next to him! - Come on, you go! Wait! - Don't let go! - You get off, Serozhka. Superiors. Listen, you gave me a good idea. Do you hear what they say? Pick it up! Well, what are you worth? Why did they shout? Look! Here! So? Ivanov. Or Ivan. But some money goes, of course. Work experience is also not a useless thing in our time. But boring, old people. Spiritual interests in the full corral. There are no girls - you get stale. Exactly, Ivan! Which, saving your life, lay here! He lies here, so you live! - But I... - People have no conscience! Why are you screaming? It’s an outrage that the grave is in this state. I agree. But what would be bad if the road passes over it? I don't understand! - Don't understand! - I don't understand! - Don't understand! - Hey guys, what are we worth? - Doesn't understand! Maybe they found some treasure, huh? Take me a share! So, we’ll transfer this grave tomorrow. The stove needs to be made. There is no way to make out the name. Come on, go around this place and come on, I’ll go and tell the diggers now. Come on! How to write something? So? Somehow awkward. Not good. Can I ask the locals, does anyone know? Nda. Why are you taking a break during working hours, Serozhka? The youngest and most beautiful. Clear. Serozhka, come on here. I see you recycled. Rest a little. Take the rail and go over there to the lineman. Ask if he knows whose grave it is. - Is this this one? - Yes. Yes. - And there is not a lot of scribble. - I'm not a smoker. But I have the right, due to my breaks, in your free time, exchange a few words with your comrades? Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Serozhka, come here! Yes now! One two three four! One, two. Slowly showing. Time. Foot behind, foot! Ha, that’s the way to work. - Listen, Yura. - Well? Voronov again clamps the weekend. - Well yes? - Well yes. Well, he says, while the weather is good, We will work seven days a week. Serozhka, come here! - And Sidorych what? - Sidorych is a burdock. Instead of vetoing, he agrees. - I, too, have chosen a trade union! - That's right, they chose a trade union. - Listen, what to do? - What? Yes, I wanted to go to the city to buy great. I say, you still need to find this woman, about which Seryozha the lineman spoke! Send someone! Of course, you can not send. To send a formal reply to the district executive committee, look, they say, our business is the side, we have done our job. - Look where you will show off! - Need to work. Well, what did you start here? Serozhka, what was the name of the woman? I told you, her name is Sofya Pavlovna. The store works. Either a cleaner or a manager. Women in the front row think, just remember 8 March. Not something to drink for ourselves. If only conscience was calm. And she will not be calm conscience something. Okay. Fly tomorrow to the city on the way. - Find them this one... - Sofya Pavlovna. Sofya Pavlovna. - The authorities know better. - That's it. So, so what do you advise me? Aren't you interested in selling? Why not interested? Interested. Well, what are you not persuading to buy? Well, what should I persuade you? If you need, you can buy it anyway. Maybe this one should be written out, eh? And in the newspapers they write that you should persuade. Little will be written. Yes, and do you happen to know Sofya Pavlovna? Why don't know? I know. - She worked here in a department store. - Yes, in the old one yet. It's a small world. Eh? Why didn’t you tell me right away? Wait. - Where is she? - I don't know. Wow! - Better take this one. - This one? More expensive, probably? - Nonetheless. Everything is good! Write out, write out! This one is a car, and that one... And where does Sofya Pavlovna live? What are you? They said that from her, and you don’t know? From her, from her. Say hello to you. But I don’t know where he lives. I want to come in to thank. In new homes, in the second building. Thank you! He lives over there, in that porch. - What is it called Lyalechka? - Yes, Lyalechka, otherwise he will not let me go. And Sofya Pavlovna, mind you, is completely deaf. - Deaf? - Almost at all. - You have to scream with her. - Nice thing. - Who is it? - Lyalechka, please open it. I came to your grandmother. Lyalechka! Lyalechka! So don't tease, don't tease! Yes, I'll give you now! And you don't tease! Serves you right! What? What do I need? - Sofya Pavlovna? - Yes. I'm on business with you, and he... Why are you yelling at me? Why tease the boy? What a mess? What is he to you Lyalechka? Poison and poison the child! I am ashamed, young man, to behave this way, very ashamed! Yes, I will explain everything to you! Why are you yelling at me? What are you to me, how deaf? What it is? I need to talk to you. Well, come on in. The commandant allowed us. It’s necessary to bury. Uh, honey, if only they knew his last name. He doesn't have a surname. So I wrote on the tablet under the asterisk: "Name is unknown." That's when she was younger, went to the grave, watched, and now... Now at the time and most die. I heard in the city as if he blew up their headquarters with grenades, or a warehouse there, they were very angry at him. And most importantly, they didn’t have long with us, and they’ve been fierce, God knows how. And we don’t know the name and in person here on the card does not say who, his face was really broken when we buried him. Or maybe others are alive, if you look here? But where will you find them now? This is Vitik. Here Mikheev, we have one gardener here, here, they said, he also had a soldier hiding. So maybe this is the one that lies by the road, huh? And where is the card, Sofya Pavlovna? And I gave the card to school, right after the ninth of May. Well, I asked, give, give, says, it is necessary, Well, here I am Lyalechka... Vitenka, please forgive me. Well, I did. Well, well, can I speak? Vitenka, well, take the young man to school. No need to worry. What do you? - Next time. - Bab, far away! Yes, the school is far away. He is studying in a German school, in a special school. Well, all the more. - No, I just came to find out. - Nothing, nothing. I just can't get used to the balcony. - I see. - You are welcome. Vitenka, Well, why are you so offended by my grandmother? Well, how can that be? - That's her? - She. Re-examination. It is not good to criticize elders, and most importantly, it is useless. Well, hold on. Well, firstly, not the sine, but the cosine. It is only necessary to remember the theorems. They were not made up by fools, for the benefit of poor students. Listen, who are you? I am a good spirit, saving the country from the abundance of second year olds. Just be quiet, I'll wait outside the door. What are these tricks? Platonov! Can't you be left for a minute? - Be ashamed! - Let me explain. I’m from "Stroy... from" Stroydorupravleniya. - From which department? - Well, which is building a road. We are the foremost, they write about us in the newspapers. You probably read. What? We hold the banner. - With difficulty, but hold. - Well, well, very interesting. Go on, I'm listening to you. During work, a grave of a soldier was found on our site. It was possible to establish that his photograph is in the school museum. Well, since a Soviet person can enter any door, which doesn’t say "No entry", then I went in and wanted to ask where she was. That's right, you are well prepared. I tried, Claudia Fedorovna! But I still put you four because you answered the first question vaguely. Everything, you can go. - Thank you! Good-bye! - You are welcome. Good-bye! Good-bye! We seem to be on fire! Aunt didn’t like that instead of calluses school chalk on hand. - Not good? - Not good. - And the percentage of academic achievement? - Oh! - But we will not. - We will not! Let's see a photo? And I thought you were lying! Well, do I look like a person who lies? Why do you need this photo? I told your teacher. Did you listen or did fear ring in your ears? Fear rang! Here she is. Pocket format. - What about the original? - Do you need a script? There is a script. Well, just the originals have more trust. Listen, are you kidding me? - In no case. - Well look. Here is the script and this is the pouch that Agapov brought along with the photograph. What about the letter? You know, you thought, it gives nothing. - And where did you live? - And what? Well, just to get the photo back, for nothing more. Bring to school. Why do you need it? Report to superiors. Listen, your city seems to have a dance floor, a film. Yes, there is, but they will let you go there if you only have a haircut. And it’s wintering, I’m warming myself. By the way, what about the movie? - And I already saw this picture. - Which one? - Young man! - Yes. So did you see the photo? - Yes, and even begged. - Yes? You helped me a lot. Thank you, thank you very much! Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! Well, will we lie for a long time? According to the strategy, he was not supposed to appear here either. "Tactics, strategy"! Collect an overcoat, wear a hat! That's what war is for planes to fly! And we are going without disguise! Mess! You talk a lot, private Ogorodnikov! Where is your rifle? In the cab remained. Soldier! Yes, the tribunal relies on it! I stitched the whole cabin, damn. And he was chasing you, Vakulin. Which, thinks, is Vakulin here? And Vakulin crawled away like a supper. - Where are you going? - I lost the pilot somewhere. A fascist, he is a fascist. Look! In! He lowered one cylinder. Look, look! But the spirit remained. By car! Distance - 20 metres! Piled up! - Go. - Come on guys! Be careful. Come on, come on guys, quicker for cover! Disguise. Come on! - Hello, dad! - Hi! How's the food? And this is what you bring, then you will reap. Is that what you mean? That's it. If not brought, then stamp in the food centre, in our city. Give me a smoke, or something. - Who am I? - Yes. No, I don't smoke. How was the ride? - Yes, they arrived normally. The air bothered. - Well, they fly. Been here long? Honestly, the third day. - And what kind of city is that? - Koryukov? A good city! Houses, streets, bathhouse, two-story, steam room. Girls, women. You stand, then this, near the station... Well yes. - Probably often in the city? - Yes, I was not in the city. Well, a smoke or something? Comrade Sergeant, who arrived without a dry ration, send those to the food centre. - So what? - A food item in the city. - So what? In the city, the food post, I say, is sent for a dry ration. They gave us rations. And if they had not given? The city is still, Koryukov. And the female gender is available. Civilisation. - Comrade Sergeant... - Now. Private Lykov, take a lot on yourself! - Comrade Sergeant... - Now. I report the situation, Comrade Petty Officer. Without you, there is someone to make a decision. What do you have? - I forgot. - Ugh you! Hey friend... Am I? I don't smoke. - Struchkov where? - Ah, Struchkov? The Struchkov are there. - Aluminium can not be soldered. - Well, the thing is good. - I don't know. - Well, what should I do? - Ogorodnikov! - Throw it away. - Didn’t you see Struchkova? - Yes, there. - Didn’t you see Struchkov? - No. Ogorodnikov! Again? Where are the Struchkov? Struchkova not seen? - Struchkova... - Well, let's help! I haven’t started yet. - Who are you asking? - Struchkova. Well, I, if necessary, Struchkov. Petty Officer Bokarev reports! Arrived from a separate author of the 172nd Infantry Division. They drove five cars for repair. Clean the cars so that they shine like your boots! Start disassembling in the morning. - Don't tear the thread. - You can get up... Can I get a contentment? Take the rations to the cook. And we do not have dry soldering. Not given out. Only certificates. Go to the city for rations. Be here tomorrow at 6:00. Have to take a walk. Have to. Yes, be tomorrow at 6:00! Let me go? Go ahead. What a handsome elder. Look, Ning. She has one beauty! Another one, huh? Looks like you. Like a brother. Or maybe a father? And I have all the ancestors alive to the fourth knee. - Iron nerves. - Come on, give it. Not similar. Well, we have done our job. We write: "The name is unknown." A rain of mushroom! Yes, turn off your barrel organ. And you can try to search more. Mikheev, they say, there is some kind in the city. School children are also looking. Well, and you started, Serozhka. No, I understand walking around the city is more interesting than shovelling gravel. Gathered, then, after the war, Russian, Englishman, American. - After the war? - Don't interrupt, after the war. And, therefore, they began to decide what to do with Hitler. The Englishman says: it’s necessary to build such a large cell and carry it around the world, show it. And the Russian Ivan says: you need to take an iron rod, glow it from one end... Lie down! What are you doing? And if I, the fool, shot you? - Inappropriate jokes, girl! - Nimble. Warrior! The bumps got scared! "Lie down!" "Lie down!" Look, all the pants are wet! Breaking panic! How do you carry a rifle? Well, why make some noise? Well, lay down, rested. Private Krajushkin, take a lot on yourself. Where are you from, huh? And out of that village. And in your village all the girls are so funny? For whom they are funny, for whom not! Comrade Petty Officer - Well. - And what to drag into the city, let's spend the night in the village better. Especially since it is 10 kilometres away. Have you climbed a tree? Goats afraid, butts. Comrade Sergeant, let's go to the city, we have to go to the city. - Ogorodnikov. - I. Take the goat and deliver it to the destination. Come in from the rear! Fuck her, she butts! Private Krajushkin, take the animal. Comrade Petty Officer, time... can I? Comrade Petty Officer, why should one end glow? So that no one could take it out. Oh, they stole it! Serozhka! Sergey! Sergey, they stole it! I look, but he is not. How to be now? Tell me where Mikheev lives? - Over there in that house. - Thank you! Hello! Does Mikheev live here? Which Mikheev? We have two floors of the Mikheevs. Fedka? So he is still breathing, he was fishing. No, I’m pensioner Mikheev. Senior citizen. Finally. Where are you disappearing? I've been waiting for you all day yesterday. Since a pension means, then, is it just possible not to bring it on time? You write, write about you in the newspaper. Is there no council on you, or what? Come on. Where to sign something? Well, I'm not with retirement. They say that during the war, soldiers were hiding. Present a book? Do you know these soldiers? What other soldiers? Well, maybe even one you know? - Vania! - Ivan? Ivan I don’t know the surname. They are the driver, with "PRB". They say one of them defeated the German headquarters. In your opinion, heroism is just that, smashing headquarters! Heroism - it happens differently. They killed him there. And buried in the cemetery. There now an obelisk stands with a star. - Exactly? - Yes. I went and asked permission from the commandant of theirs. Allowed? Burrow says where you want. They didn't give a damn about our graves! They were afraid of the living. Yes, that's for sure, it's him, Vania. Give me a smoke or something. A bathhouse would be nice now. Bathhouse, son, Yes, the bathhouse could be emptied, but we carry water from the river. The well is clogged, one dirt is there. Everyone goes past us no one stops. Nobody needs us. They are afraid to climb into the well. A military man, a citizen, is not afraid of anything, besides the female gender. Why are you so scared of women? And I'm afraid of their cunning. Ogorodnikov, Vakulin, clean the well of foreign objects. Would shave, comrade Sergeant. - And so beautiful. - And it would be even more beautiful. Not your relics to work miracles. Why aren’t you following the order? You can’t do it with our Sergeant - it’ll be washed down. What a terrible knife you have. Steel arms. Without him at the front, as without hands. Fritsev, then drive away soon? Well, I can’t name the exact date, but I think next year we will end the war successfully. Now at the front is the position of the puff pie. Fritz we Fritz... A medal for courage? What was your courage? - Are you curious to know everything? - But what about! A military secret? That's it. I can say only to a very close person. - Let's see how it is with the well? - What for? Everything will be done as prescribed. In the army, the commander’s order is law. Maybe give a smoke? Can’t you be careful, hog? You don’t see, the man is there! You hold the rope tighter, otherwise you will miss your handsome man! How's it going - Vakulin. - Good! Raise up Private Vakulin! Faster. Yes, let go of you! Screaming, screaming! Vanya, poor thing, they tortured you completely. These are the sacrifices made by the heroic Soviet soldier in the name of the rear, and you just move away. Irink, I'm looking for you! Is the next dance with me? And I'm already busy. But I need you on business. If society does not mind, the ladies change their gentlemen. I agree. What is this? And they turn off at 10 o’clock. So early? But what about lovers? And for lovers it’s even more convenient. Irina, I will accompany you. Sorry, I have something with a lace. Listen, someone is calling you there. - Where? - There, there, there, there! Where? I told you that I need you exclusively on business. I know your affairs. Well, here I spend and tell everything. Honestly. Well, listen, it's very simple! Excuse me, please! We give a telegram, we get the answer, find out the name and the search is over! - Sit down, write. - No, no, you sit down. I? Okay. Moscow, defence, tell me if any of the "PWB" is alive. - Urgent? - Yes, yes, urgent. Nine 70. - Sorry, simple, please. - Simple? Three roubles one penny. Well, you see, I told you that I called you on business. - You helped me so much. - Yes, but how much time. And I will accompany you. Citizen, take a receipt. I went camping then to distant lands... it was difficult with children. They lived in barracks. And without them, even worse. Now I have big guys but I remember them, how about little ones. It turns out that you were a distinguished man, Comrade Krajushkin. It happened. Introduced me to the medal "For labour distinction." Everyone thought: Krajushkin would receive an award, but he didn't receive. There was a laugh. Hello, he sends you a bow, My lovely. In my little pocket There is your card So, we are always together Look like a lightning. How nice to meet. - Great, Irinka! - Hi! You are so familiar with me, just awful. - Nobody gave you the right. - And I snatched it from the coming days. - Listen, there is a suggestion. - What? - Well, are you free? - Watching for what. - You need to go to Struchkov. - And who is it? - Did you get an answer? - But what about! So, Struchkov is a former commander of the automobile depot, which we stood here, and now he’s the head of "Oblselkhozstroy" or something like that. In short, in the district centre. Take the train? Listen, let's better fly on a plane, huh? It is possible on deer. Well, how do you like responsiveness? Wow! Listen, you're because of those soldiers, right? Want to show him a picture? Want. Why are you looking at me like that? I am trying to understand. This is an ancient girl’s error that they can read thoughts while looking. - One hundred percent error guarantee. - Oh, how complicated you are! Yes, we are complex. Maybe over the years we’ll take it easy too, but so far complicated. Anyway, I want to find out the name of that guy who lay there with us, on the road. 5:43. Managed on time! Nyurka, scratch home! Further military unit, unauthorised entry is prohibited. Well, what didn’t you see? Well, stop looking, let's go. Well, good-bye. Will you write? Field mail 72392. Well, what are you silent? You will not kiss your young women? Yes, I have no young lady, he told you so. "Said". You, the drivers in each village have their own young lady. You fool, you fool. Neither mountains nor carts. Then he fix the well, then patched up the fence. Where are we going to search now? Okay, shut up. Harrows like a harrow. Let's go to Koryukov, eastward. There we find out where "PRB". Look. To the barn. Alive! Second! Germans! - What we are going to do? - Someone needs to die. Or us either to the Germans. Lykov, Vakulin, Krajushkin for the elder, block the road! You’ll shoot with a pointer, and I will take care of the machine gunner. Hans. Have you seen the Germans before? No, I didn’t. Lykov, take the rear. Vakulin! Ogorodnikov, follow me! It seems quiet. It’s necessary to leave. Where are the people? - I didn’t catch up! - You get it! Cut the boot! Ogorodnikov! Comrade Petty Officer - I forgot his documents. - Faster and catch up! The district development plan can be implemented in two versions: in this and in this. So, the first option: the main buildings are along the riverbank, with some aspiration of its channel within the limits of 186-189. We are here to deliver you a toe. And here we are here a cross. And here we will put you a toe. A cross if? Comrade, I already told you, there is a meeting going on. Do you understand? Meeting. And before two hours later it will not end. I’m a toe to you. Your walker. Do you have flood data for the last 5-10 years? - Yes, we do. - And what is the highest water level? I will say the highest level of water. There he is. Comrade, aren't you ashamed? What's the matter, young man? I'm asking you! What's the matter? What do you have? You see I'm about soldiers. And I have a train, and you have a meeting. You see, Grigory Mikhailovich, this young man I asked you to transfer the package only, and now here. Understand. And who are these soldiers? The fact of the matter is that I myself do not know who they are. And where are you from? I am from Koryukov. Koryukov. That's it, Koryukov. And I just could not remember where I saw this Sergeant. We stood in this city in the summer of 1942. In September they left on alarm. At night. - The German broke through. - Exactly, in September. War is a difficult thing. All circumstances are not always known. people die, go missing, no witnesses left. These people are gone and they didn’t return either to "PRB" or to their car battalion. I have no reason to blame them. This is a long-standing affair. And which of them is your relative? - No one. - You said it from relatives. I? No, that’s probably what your secretary said. A! I thought you were a relative of one of them, didn't mean to offend you. I personally had a very bad impression about them. Now I recall this Sergeant. I really did not like this Sergeant. Such was the dandy, he sawed off work. In September 1942 one of them defeated the German headquarters. And the Germans killed him. And here I am, as I thought. Maybe you know their names? And then I have to go. I think the names can be restored. I suppose the archives have been preserved. And you, perhaps, will be late? - You stay with me. - No, I'm in a hurry. Then leave a photo, without it people will not be recognized. Just bring her back, please. We’ll make inquiries, I’ll inform you right away. And where to? Koryukov, fourth school, "Ranger Headquarters". Schoolboy, mean? No, I'm not from school. I work at Dorstroy, we are laying the highway. - 49th. - Yes. You are well done, well done. But I thought... Well, well done. Yes, it’s not me, this is the boss who sent me. Well, then, your bosses are well done. - Great, Serozhka! - Great! - Where did you go? - Yes, that's it. And Zinochka was waiting for dancing yesterday, worried. - Well yes? - Yes, I reassured her. - Let me light it. - But you are not a smoker. Like this. Pasha, look, Serozhka is back. Hey fiance, Sunday ended yesterday! Seryozha, the Ravens are coming! Go work! You’ll come in after the shift. Sergey! Serozhka! What are you? What happened to you? So summer is hot. Drink. Drink. Hold on Master! Come on, drink. - Come on, water. - Where is your hospital here? I was at school, but now I do not know. Don't hold out. You have a lie. Find a hospital - take it. Watch out. Here. Well, Vanya? I can go. No, no, Vanya, you lie down, lie down. - Take care of the guy, master. - Okay. Without me, Vanya, nowhere. Yes, we got between the doorpost and the door. - Don't pass me the free company. - What are you to blame? Lost people, then blame. Okay. The supply must be reached. We will take Vakulin, we will go further. Come along. My Vitka has exactly the same textbook. I'll take your blotter. Where, mother, do asses lead? In the courtyard of the club, it is a checkpoint. - Take the bread! - Thank you! Take the bread! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Learn to plaster first. Seryozha! - Hello! - Here, movie tickets. Well, I went. Serge, wait. You know, a letter came from Struchkov about those soldiers. Wait a minute, I'll bring it to you. So go upstairs for now. - Is it necessary to get acquainted? - Well, wait. - And you don't smoke? - No. It’s a pity, otherwise they would have lit it. - And you don't drink? - No. It’s a pity, otherwise they would have drunk. It turns out... Come here. It turns out this soldier from Siberia. - Do you remember the letter "B" on the pouch? - Well? So this is his last name - Bokarev. There is no other surname for the letter "B". True, there is still a name on "B" - Boris, it seems, Krajushkin. Irina, we're late! We, in Siberia, the mother of Bokarev, we wrote a letter. So, everything is in order. Irene, let's go, huh? Let's go to. Vasilievna, can I come to you? Can. Come in, come in, Manya. Come in. - Hello! - Hello! About the house. Heard you sell a house, - Bokareva Serafima... - Vasilyevna. - Vasilyevna. - Sell, sell. - Are you moving? - I'm leaving completely. - Long away? - To Russia itself. City Koryukov. Didn't hear? No, however. And who owns the house? In the field he is a house. They ask who the house is on. Worried buy, and then what heirs will appear or who else. I have no heirs, lonely me. She lost her husband and son during the war. Here to the son and food. Missing the war and now his grave was found, I’m going to her. - How did you find the grave? - There were good people. What a joy! Not scattered know on the ground of his bones. Oh, such comfort to you, Vasilyevna, in old age, such comfort. Eagle, pure eagle. I gave the frame. Travel far away. Nda. He needs a man’s house. He would have a repair, then a suitable price could be called. Money is needed for repairs. From where to get them? Well, the collective farm should help you, as the mother of the hero, the village council. They offered her, but refused. In vain refused. No, really, buy one. I take money for the house, not for my son. My son has no price. No, don't pass me the free company. Do you see horses? - Why do you need a horse? - They’ll climb over the hay. No, you can’t see, just motorcycles. Then order. Well Vakulin arranged for people. Family like. What the hell are you pushing? Bad thing, the Germans will be right now. To hide where the soldier. They will find - they will kill everyone. Where are you hiding something? There is no subfield either. Come up with something, Semyon. Drive in the backside. - You can’t leave, you’ll disappear! - Lead faster! Thank you you! Here, Vanya. You cross the river, and there are gardens. And there it’s close to the forest. Mum! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Grandmothers, if only they treated us to tea or something! Go away. Serozhka! Listen, Serozhka, came off the collective. Are you all alone with your schoolgirl? But she’s nothing. Would introduce. Or do you only play trackers with her, huh? Well, I found a lesson. Do not wave. Well, what do you imagine about yourself? Shovel with eyes. Well, here we are building the road - the living will ride on it. We are all human, we are all human and you don’t have to present yourself better than you really are. And you want to stick everything forward. Here, who does not want to slave and does not know how, he sticks out on such things. I can’t do anything else, so at least let me jump out. Yes, I see right through you. Would you go to work with an x-ray here to rake money. Yes you are not ham, you! Maybe my grandfather and two uncles died too! So, do I run now around the world graves to look for them? Are you alluding to this by your example? I hint that you are a fool. What? Fool? Hope to be a fool. Because in another case, you're just a scoundrel! And this is much worse, by the way! Ah, you snot! Please note that we will not be paid for the ballots. Not a work injury. Are you blowing bubbles? Caught a fly, but missed. - In. - You are a risky guy. Enough - they will search. - You have to leave, break through! - Where to? The car can be stolen. Nothing will work with the machine. What are you doing? What are you doing? Wanted a prisoner? This is you in vain. Let's wait. Not a century, they will be here. Well, this was not reported to us by the authorities, neither ours nor theirs. We hide in our land like rats. Here is life. The meaning of life is thought out of fear. What fear is there? It's a shame just. Well, where are we hiding from them? In Russia itself! Did you call? Yes, but no one is home. It’s strange. Actually, they should be at home. - I'm to the Krayushkin. - So, to us. What do you need? I'm about your grandfather, probably. Grandfathers? Actually, dad got a call from the military enlistment office. Why do you need my grandfather? We find out his grave or not him. Grave Him, not him - what's the difference? For example, I don’t care where they bury me, let them burn it better. Here Engels, for example, after death he ordered himself to be burned, and the ashes should be scattered into the sea. Well, this is Engels’s personal file, Marx did not give such an order. By the way, what's your grandfather's name? His name is... Papa’s name is Valery Borisovich, so his name was... - Boris... - Well, what about your middle name? You stumble. Respect for the past - this is the line that distinguishes education from savagery. Pushkin. Yes, this is my father. In September 1942, he wrote that they are being sent to another part. He promised to send a new address, but... for some reason... Then we managed tried to search, but somehow everything... In general, we were later informed that he was missing. There he is. And this is me. And yes, but I wanted to enlarge this photo all the time, but the wife says now photos do not hang on the wall, this is not fashionable... In general, the devil knows her, maybe she is right. What? - Tattoo? - Ah, yes, these are the sins of youth. In childhood I wanted to be like a father. He got the same one, well, and gouged out. - Did he have exactly the same? - Exactly like that. This is probably your father buried there. A woman alone, Sofya Pavlovna, said the soldier was the same. He defeated the German headquarters. Check this out. It seemed like a quiet person. It can be seen that the Germans made him angry. Wait, maybe money for the monument is needed? No, it's done. Sorry. Good-bye. I will accompany you! What are you, brother, running around? Disappear! And who will work? And you’ll run to the pay: "Comrade Voronov, take the middle one?" I don't intend to go to court for you. Personal affairs - after hours. Each of us has relatives, and girls, yes. And I'm not for girls. Well, so much the worse for you. I found out about the soldier. Well, why were you silent then? This grave also touched me for the soul. Or do you mean that all the strangers in the brigade or something? But it’s impossible. The day after tomorrow go away from here with your amateur performances. And in general, you won’t go to work. And who will work? Where are you going? I bow to you from my mother, my only son you sought my Bones. It's been 29 years since the day he went to the front and stayed there. And I'm still waiting and waiting for him. And it seems to me that he will approach the window, knock. Now I’ll go to my son, to live the last days. Thank you motherly. I remain Serafima Vasilievna Bokareva. They stand still. It is necessary to decide if they stay until night. To the extreme, the Führer also misses someone. Laden. Canned food, I guess. - We would have to squeeze the drawer. - Chatting a lot, Private Krajushkin. - The sentries are set. - But what, according to the charter. Do you think they are mugs? Comrade Petty Officer Do you respect canned food "Bulls in Tomato"? And you do not look. Don't annoy yourself in vain. - Or maybe it's not canned. - May be. Ammunition. What are you smelling blot all over? With hunger? It smells like guys. Barriers for this "Opel" is not an obstacle. What do you think, comrade fighter? I get up before dawn today On a wide pass the field Something with my memory has become Everything that was not with me, I remember. On, Serozhka, hold it. Why money? The guys gathered. The guys think you need to go to an old woman. - To Bokareva? - In-in, explain. You can write, probably. You can't hide behind a letter. Sometimes in life a person needs to look into the eyes. Tell her give hope. People, they say, are looking. Seeking - they will find. Will help. She once lost her son, now lose in another. But the guys wanted the best. Rejoiced. But how do I tell her that? This is the mother. Have you been writing to your mother for a long time? Recently. I get up before dawn today On a wide pass the field Something with my memory has become Everything that was not with me, I remember. Raindrops hit the sunken cheeks; For the universe, 20 years is not enough. I didn’t even know the guy Promised: "I'll be back, mum." Seryozha, pies with you on the path. Yes, no, Aunt Pasha, I have with me. Morning, warm. - Well, Aunt Pasha. - Come on. - Oh, Thank you! - Here you go. - Good-bye! - Go, honey. Well, then you’ll go there, to the gravel. Can't you drop him to the station, or what? Here, the house has sold. You can’t buy a house without money in a new place, you can’t even buy the worst. And they gave a good price. I just don’t know if I’ll get there? Just take a peek at his grave. Thank you so much, you are my good ones! Well, thank you! But why bother so? To go so far! Itself would have gathered! Why is it going to gather something? Thank you you! Thank you, you are my good! I would drink some water. Where? There, in the hallway, a tub is standing there. And the bucket is there. I gave it to the new owners. Why drag it? Serafima Vasilievna, can you not go yet? Wait? I don’t have time to wait. I will go. I’ll live on the land where my Kostya died. Follow me. Oh no key. Not. Directly connect. Where to? Start up! Hold on! Well, pray to your god, you bastards! Come on, don't wait for us on the 17th kilometre! - Serozhka? The Serozhka is in that trailer. - There? - Only you were late your cavalier left. Nothing, will be back soon. Come on, hold on. What do you need Serozhka for? Serozhka, I say, why? You see, there must be a grave. - Why you asking? - My grandfather is there. Let's go, daughter, I’ll show you. Well, couldn’t you take pictures? You’ll go straight along the road. Yes, it’s very close here, and there you’ll see it yourself. Thank you! Wait a minute. I get up before dawn today On a wide pass the field Something with my memory has become Everything that was not with me, I remember. Raindrops hit the sunken cheeks; For the universe, 20 years is not enough. I didn’t even know the guy Promised: "I'll be back, mum." And the steppe grass smells of bitterness, Young winds are green. We wake up and rumble over midnight Either a thunderstorm, or an echo of a past war. It promises to be a long spring, Waiting for selected grain arable land. And I live in good land For myself and for that guy. I'm so bent on severity But you cannot live otherwise if Everything is calling me his voice Everything sounds in me his song. And the steppe grass smells of bitterness, Young winds are green. We wake up and rumble over midnight Either a thunderstorm, or an echo of a past war. We wake up and rumble over midnight Either a thunderstorm, or an echo of a past war.
