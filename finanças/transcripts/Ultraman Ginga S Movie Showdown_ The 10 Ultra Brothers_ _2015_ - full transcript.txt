Ultraman Cosmos! Using such pathetic battle moves, you shall never defeat me! Cos-mos! THE CASTLE OF SPACE-TIME Got you at last Etelgar! You won’t escape from me this time! Yes, I shall escape Ultraman Zero, but not before I leave you with some parting gifts! Ah! Lost him again! If he remains on the loose, we’re finished! All evil Ultramen shall be captured for the sake of the Universe! Etelgar, our next target? Ultraman Ginga, the Ultra-Warrior from planet Earth’s future. ULTRAMAN GINGA S: THE MOVIE Yaay! Welcome back! Captain, some herbal tea! Oooh! Oh? -Arisa! -Thanks. -Here. -Thank you very much. I’ll use this thing for target practice! So, you vacationed the whole time? Didn’t you learn anything the past twelve months while training overseas? I sure did! Plenty! Here! This one is yours! Oh Sakuya, thanks. Hm? Why are you here? Ah, Captain Jinno recruited me. I’m still on probation. The subterranean world of Victorian is working with us now to defend Earth. She’s like having a little sister on the team! -Right?! -Stop it! We have another new team member. Huh? Mana! Wha... ah, what are you doing here? Why’s everyone so calm? Her memory was saved in Victorien. I used all my knowledge to rebuild her and uploaded her memory using the Victorien crystal. It’s nice to meet you. Oh... same here. A new era for UPG will now begin. When Shou’s back he’ll be really shocked! Right! The alarm! Man your positions! Point T 9. An alien object. Space-Time distortions. Investigate it now! UPG Go! Got it! What is that? Look at that! Run! Run! The space time rip opened a parallel universe. So that alien craft’s from a different dimension? What do you want? You are of no concern. I’m after Ultraman Ginga. Ginga’s not here! We have no choice. Return fire! Got it! Stop now! What do you want with Ginga, huh?! It’s all the Ultramen... Yes! And each one of them is evil! To insure peace throughout the Universe, every Ultraman shall be entombed! How can you say all that? The Ultramen aren’t evil. So you’re on their side? Alright! You’ll receive no mercy! Alena! The mirror mustn’t be used like that! You are... ? What the... Behold the Space-Time Warrior responsible for imprisoning every Ultraman! I am Etelgar! Etelgar? Princess Alena, please allow me to annihilate these enemy Earthlings for you. Victorium Slash! My apologies for being late! It’s party time!! Yeah! Start your show! Ultraman Victory! One more accursed Ultra-Warrior from this world! You’re one of us? Ultra-Live! Transforming to Ultraman Ginga!! Gin-gaaa!! Ginga... Victory... So, that’s Ginga! Let’s go! Now to finish you! Ginga Fire Ball! Oh no! Hikaru! Move aside! Only a direct attack will break that mirror! Ultra-Lance! Sherperdon - Saber!! This’ll cut you down to size! What? You guys can not stop him fighting separately! Combine your powers! Oh... No!! Princess, use your mirror to trap these two. Guys! Those are your human forms! -Sakuya! -Hikaru! That weird sound! Princess Alena! You’re lucky that there were no fatalities. Etelgar has captured seven Ultramen. And... You’re... ? I’m a friend. Name’s Musashi. I fought with Ultraman Cosmos until... So you’re also an Ultraman hero? I am. Cosmos was hit by the mirror’s ray and we separated. Couldn’t you break him free? My strength alone could not smash the mirror’s power. The UPG will assist you Musashi. Tomoya, Mana, analyze that mirror! Right away Captain. We’ll find the way to free them! Captain... thank you! Hikaru, is something bothering you? That girl... the Princess... she... She was hurt... You’re right. Very strange... She’s known as Alena, the royal Princess of Zanto. It’s a peaceful world. My dear Princess, please compose yourself! We must not allow thoughts of the past to disturb you, my child, oh no! The Ultramen conquered my home world, therefore I must capture and punish them! Halt! Don’t move! Where is Ginga?! I want my sweet revenge!! Arisa! You better leave. Mana! The crystal! Oh... ! What... what has happened to me? Don’t worry you’re okay. You were controlled by Etelgar the whole time. But no more!! I’ll protect you from that big devil! Oh man, that’s a good one! Who are you? We’re Earth’s special investigation team. UPG. I’m member Raido, Hikaru. Ultraman Ginga. Ultraman?! What’s wrong... ? Ultraman Ginga... destroyed my planet! What?! Ultra-man would never do such a thing! -Etelgar must have lied to you! -How could he? I was there! I saw it! Etelgar saved my life! I’m the only survivor. But your planet Zanto wasn’t destroyed! Princess, you still have a home world! Honest! This is all, just another trick! Alena!! Princess Alena, trap Ultraman Ginga immediately! Etelgar... No! Stop!! Do not interfere with me!! A new Ultraman! Long time no see Musashi! Etelgar, it’s time to finish this! Zero! You didn’t get enough of my punishment on Planet Juran?! Hikaru! You better take Alena outta here. Yeah! Alena... let’s go. Relax now, we’re safe! Why don’t you give me a smile? Hear me Princess! That young man shattered your home world! Ultraman Ginga is your arch-enemy! Alena!! Alena!! Don’t... No!! Alena!! Great Zero Bow! Aiming Ultimate Zero... and release! You’re terminated!! Alena!! Stop!! No, not again!! Prin-cess... I know! I’ll trap them all next time! Curse you Ultraman Ginga!! Ultraman Ginga! Meet me at our Castle of Space-Time before... sundown. or else the seven Ultramen will die. Hold it Hikaru! Ah... I’ve got to save Alena! Forget it! She’s gone now! Shou’s right, and you’re no match for Etelgar!! I’ve got a plan. -Tomoya. -Yes. Victorium and the Zanto mirror have identical frequencies. So if the Victorium energy is amplified, the alien mirror can be destroyed and the seven Ultramen will be freed. Let’s use the monster Shepherdon’s energy, -ah... right Shou? -Yeah! Captain! Let’s do it now! No! Hikaru! Shou! Shepherdon can’t do this alone. Huh? Ultraman Taro informed me about you two! I was told you were advanced warriors, but I see you’ll need an extra 20000 years of training. That’s not true! Listen! Etelgar is nearly invincible! Even I have struggled to defeat that powerful enemy! However, if both of you combine your strengths and energies, Etelgar may be stopped. Heh? Get these cuffs off! Now you two must think and act as one! You’re both one body, to defeat the enemy! It will soon be sundown. Time to commence our rescue mission! Got it! This is all a load of bull, Zero! How can these handcuffs help... ? Hold that tongue and trust me! Ah... Re-Relax... I trust you, Zero! The Earth is your planet, not mine. If you two Ultramen can’t protect her, then tell me who will? Knock it off! Just testing your reflexes. Don’t stand there! -Get moving!! -He is crazy! Right! Hold tight! Sundown in sixty minutes. Team! Commence the frontal attack! Got it! The enemy has arrived. They’ll taste Feeaaarrrrr! Oh no, don’t look at that light!! Hey where... am I? Goki?! Sakuya?! Where’d you go? What the... ? Im... im... im... impossible!! Jiang-shi?! Go away!! Go Away!! Go away!! Aaah! A... giant... tomato!! I can’t... stand... tomatoes!! Huh? Huh? What’s going on here? A bug! A really big one! I hate bugs!! Guys, wake up! Ah... Goki, you’re hallucinating! Hey! Wake up! Hey! What’s wrong? What’s happening? Scanners reading massive levels of adrenaline... triggering their fight or flight responses. Perhaps they are imaging what fears them the most. Guys, wake up! Don’t be afraid! Aren’t you afraid of anything? Bet you are! Let us find out. Not before I break your mind control! Both of you must now scale this cliff! At the very top, you’ll find the ultimate power to defeat Etelgar once and for all. Get moving!! Start on the right! The left is easier! Hey! Stop pulling... -Ah!! -Oh! I was just kidding! I love bugs! Move! Ah... Jump to the top on the count of three! Ready? Sure am! -One. -Two!! Three!! We did it! We thought and acted as one in mind and body! Right! Good job men! You passed the test. Where is that... ultimate power? You and Shou have it now! Heh? What... ? That Ultra Fusion Bracelet was entrusted to me by Ultraman King. The King? Yes, Ultraman King, the most powerful and oldest living Ultra Warrior. He’s back on our home world, Nebula M-78. Now you’re ready to use that power to its fullest... both of you! Hikaru, we did it! Shou. Hikaru to UPG Team! Shou and I successfully completed our training. I’m sure you’ve commenced your attack! Hikaru! Good work! Oh No!! We learned that everyone has something they may not want to face. It could be frightening or painful. Hikaru? But you can’t run away! You must face and overcome that big fear! Hikaru is right!! Pulses stabilizing. Adrenaline levels are lowered. They’re attempting to overcome their fears. Great!! Team! Continue with attack! Got it! -Got it! -Got it! I did it!
