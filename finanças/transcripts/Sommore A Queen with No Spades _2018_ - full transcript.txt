How beautiful is the theater? How beautiful is the theater? It was hard to top this motherfucker right here. It was hard to top this theater. But you know I do what I do. So tonight I got on church jewelry, club clothes and hoe shoes. [audience cheering] The way I'm dressed, I could pussy fuck or praise dance in this bitch tonight. That's right, this is what I love to do. Let me tell y'all, we are in beautiful Miami Beach. And how awesome is the weather, though, right? Let me tell y'all somethin', it's so fucking hot in Miami that the dykes wear sundresses. And you ain't never seen no funny shit till you seen a dyke in a motherfuckin' sundress. Think of the manliest bitch you know in a motherfuckin' sundress. Them bitch be walkin', gettin' their little pimp on, then they gotta stop and pull their shit up like... [Sommore sighs] But I've been having nothin' but a great time. Nothin' but a great time. But what I realized is Miami Beach is different than Miami. See, here's the thing, don't let all that water and sand fucking fool you. See, we're in Miami Beach, but the goddamn airport is in Miami. It's a whole another beast when you cross that fucking bridge, you understand what I'm sayin'? Miami ain't nothin' to be fucked up with. Shit can get little dangerous in Miami. I ain't gonna lie, before I left the airport, five motherfuckers told me to be careful... while I was in Miami. I swear, let me tell you, I swear to God. Soon as I got off the plane, dude work at the airport, he was like, "Yo, what's up, Sommore?" He was like, "Yo, I heard you got a show in town this weekend. "I ain't gonna be able to make it, baby, "'cause I gotta work all weekend. "But I know you're gonna do your thing. "But do me a favor while you're here in Miami. You be careful now. Be careful." I was like, "Alright, dude, I got you. I got you." I ain't think shit about it. Ain't think shit about it. So I walk and go on to the baggage claim, see a little sister, she serving popcorns. She was like, "Sommore," she was like, "Yo, me and my girls got tickets to the show tonight. "We know you're gonna do your thing. "But do me a favor while you're here in Miami. Watch your back." I said, "What the fuck that supposed to mean? Shit." Like, I'm from the 'hood, I ain't dealin' shit to nobody. So I'm like, "What the fuck that supposed to mean?" So I still didn't think nothin' about it. Wasn't until we got to the baggage claim. This little, young dude handlin' the help, helpin' us handle our bags. And I knew he wasn't coming to the show 'cause he was just way too thugged out. But the crazy part about it is he knew who I was. He was like, "Yo, Ms. Sommore, yo! "My mom love you, man. My mom love you, man." He was like, "Yo, Ms. Sommore, look. "I know you and your people, y'all in town and everythin', "makin' things happen, but do me a favor, Ms. Sommore, "while you here in Miami. Keep your head on the swivel." Now when a motherfucker tell you to keep your head on the swivel, bitch, that mean watch your back and your front. That's... I said, "Shit!" Well, that shit had me fucked up. And I ain't gonna lie, I was just a little bit paranoid. I was so fuckin' paranoid, I had the weed man meet me at the police station. [chuckles] I said, "Shit, I can't take a chance on goin' gettin' no weed and the motherfucker done warned you." That's right. That's right. I am a legal-weed, marijuana-medicinal participant. I am, I am a participant. Mm-hmm. And the crazy part about it is, it's just fucking all my family and my friends up. They can't believe it, they're like, "Bitch, how did you wait this late in life to start smoking weed?" I'm like, "Bitch, how did I wait this late in life to find out I got attention-deficit disorder?" Like, I'm si... Like, here the thing. Here the thing. I always knew I had a little glitch. No, fuck that. Everybody in this bitch got a little glitch. And it's something wrong with everybody here. Always knew I had a little glitch, right? And I never really paid much attention to it. But I found out that I have attention-deficit disorder. And for those of you that don't know what attention-deficit disorder is, it's when you can't focus for a long period of time. Like, you can't pay attention for a long period of time. Here's when I knew that I had to go get some help. One day I'm in the mall, I stopped this girl, I'm asking for directions how to get to a store. She started giving me directions to the store. As she giving me directions to the store, my ADD kick in, I started countin' the moles on this bitch's face. She said, "You know where you goin'?" I said, "Thirteen, you got "thirteen moles on your face. "Oh, one more time. One more time. One more time. "One more time. One more time, come on. Tell me one more time. One more time." I said, "Goddamn, I got this shit bad. "I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'." I said, "I got to do somethin'." And, look, here the thing, the crazy part about it, I made it all through college. All through college, but not know... I knew that some shit was wrong, but I never really wanted to address this shit, right? And I was always afraid to admit to people, like, I was uncomfortable reading books that didn't have pictures in it 'cause I just couldn't... It couldn't hold my attention span for a long period of time. But now I'm comfortable, fuck that shit. Listen, you want me to read your book, you got to have some pictures in that motherfucker. Like, I want them pictures that, people, I got to go page-page, picture-picture. Page-page. Picture-picture. Now if ya ain't got no pictures, you get ready to lose me. I don't understand that shit. I'm serious. Like, I tried to read certain books without pictures that I thought would be a easy read. Like, I tried to read, "Diary Of A Video Vixen," by Superhead. Y'all remember the girl Superhead? Superhead wrote a whole book about suckin' dick. Not one picture of her suckin' dick in the book. I'm like, "How the fuck you write a whole book "about suckin' dick, but not one picture of you suckin' dick in the book?" Bitch, that's like writin' a cook book with no recipes. How the fuck... You got to show your work somewhere. [Sommore chuckles] But I'm tellin' y'all, the medical marijuana is doin' amazing things for people. It's doin' amazing things. People that's dealin' with pain, people that's dealin' with, uh, cancer patients, people that's dealin' with attention-deficit disorder, can't sleep, it is doing amazing things. Really is. It's really changing the medical business. And I ain't lyin', I tried weed back in my 20s. Come on now. I tried weed back in my 20s. But, ladies, y'all know that shit was too strong back in the day. You fuck around, come on now, you know, smoke some weed. Fuck around and hit a blunt, hit a joint. You fuck around, hit a joint, you start having them old deep-ass thoughts. Get all paranoia, you know you had 'em deep-ass thoughts. You started thinkin' about shit that if you weren't smokin' weed you wouldn't even have had this shit on your mind. You fuck around and smoke a joint, you start thinkin' about all the niggers you done fuck for free. You'd be sittin' there feelin' bad about yourself, like, "Damn, I could have paid my car off by now. "This is some bullshit. I gotta just get my shit together." And it wasn't you, it was the weed makin' you feel like that. (female #1) Right! But not this new weed. Let me tell y'all somethin'. This new shit, I ain't gonna lie to y'all. I'm so focused right now... I could take the SAT test tonight. Now, I don't know what college I'll end up at, but I could take that bitch tonight. That's how focused I am. And I really, I still can't deal with the street weed. I can't smoke street weed, it's just too strong. Like, two months ago we was in Philadelphia, alright? We're in Philadelphia, I forgot to bring my vape pen. So they ran out and I was havin' a real bad day. Headache, couldn't sleep, couldn't relax. They ran out and got me some weed, right? Regular street weed. Let me tell y'all somethin'. That shit was so strong, I hit a blunt at 12 noon. I was high all day long. I was so fuckin' high, ladies, we went to the club that night, I'm sittin' in that bitch with glue with no lashes on. [audience laughing] High as a motherfucker. Glue all on my lids, lashes back at the house, bitch. I'm sittin' in that bitch, I'm like, "These niggas can't see me. These niggas can't see me." Bitch, I'm high. High. [chuckles] But it has changed my life, it really has. Made a whole difference in my life. Changed my whole life. Tellin' you. And-and it's made my job easier. Ladies and gentlemen, I am a stand-up comedian. I have been a stand-up comedian for 25 years, 25 years. [audience cheering] Yeah. And, and I love it. I love it. I tell people all the time, I have the best job in the world. Best job in the world. Here's how I see my job. Here's how I see my job. I see my job as every single weekend I'm goin' to a party. I dress like a party. I don't know who's gonna be in the buildin', but I always, I know there's gonna be some fly motherfuckers in the buildin'. See, this is the reputation that I've gained throughout the years. So city to city and state to state, only the best of the best come out to see me do what it is that I do. Only the best of the best. That's right. That's right. Not, not everybody's here, but only the best of the best. So look at, look at the people you're sitting amongst. These are the movers and shakers, the entrepreneurs. The 401(k) havin' plan motherfuckers. That's right. Yes, property owners. You know, people doing shit. Ain't no foot-draggin' bitches sittin' up in here. Ain't no bitches walkin' on the back of their shoes sittin' up in here. Ain't no bitches with dirty bra straps sittin' up in here. Ain't no bitches with hair bonnets and pajama pants sittin' on up in here. All the men caught up on their child support, ain't no men in the rear sittin' up in here. Y'all ain't even try to fuck with that. Y'alls like, "Oh, shit." I shut this whole side down right here. They were like... Did I put too much on it? Did I put too much on it? (male #1) No, baby, no! [indistinct chatter] But here's what, here's what I love. Here's what I love about the people that support my work, first of all, I love that an eclectic group of people come out to see me do what it is that I love to do. First of all, I love that y'all are smart enough to know what the fuck eclectic means. [audience cheering] Yes. And for those of you that don't know what eclectic means, go with it, bitch, go with it, bitch. Go with it, bitch. Go with it, bitch. Somebody explain it to you in the car, go with it, bitch. Sometime you just gotta act like you know shit you don't even know. Go with it. But here's what I love. First of all, I love that the room is racially mixed. I love that. I love that the room is racially mixed. See, I think that we're livin' in a world right now where there's too much racial tension. Way too much racial tension. Way too much racial tension. And the bottom line is, ain't nobody goin' nowhere. [audience cheering] So we all gotta figure this shit out. Black people, we seen some shit last year that fucked us up, that we had never seen before. In Charlottesville, Virginia, they had a race riot with one race of people. And, black people, we was fucked up. 'Cause you think about it. Usually when ya have a race riot you got two race of people. But in Charlottesville, Virginia, they had a motherfucking race riot with all white people. And, black people, we was at home watching that shit on TV, we was fucked up. We ain't never seen no shit like this before. We didn't know who was on which team. The motherfuckers ain't have on no, no jerseys, no hoods, no baseball caps. We was confused like a motherfucker. We're like, "What the fuck is going on?" How can you have a race riot with one race of people? And we was fucked up. We ain't never seen no shit like this before. And the crazy thing about it was, it was, it was... It started out as a peaceful protest, but the shit turned into a all-night riot. I think, by the end of the riot, somebody jumped in their car and ran somebody over. Somebody actually got killed in the riot. It was crazy. They had one dude out there, he was leadin' a pack, tellin' everybody which way to go. I'm sittin' at home, like, "Shit, he must be the crack of Luther King of all this shit." 'Cause he just runnin' shit. We ain't never seen no shit like this before. So everybody was like, well, everybody was sayin', "Well, why didn't black people go down there and get involved? Why didn't black people go down there and get involved?" I'm sittin' there, like, "I'll tell you why black people "didn't go down there and get involved. "First of all, they kicked the march off on a Tuesday. "We don't march on no motherfuckin' Tuesday. "We gotta get ready to get all revved up on Tuesday, "then you got to calm the fuck down "and go back to work on Wednesday. "That ain't how we work. "You know how we do. "We talk shit on Friday, "send it to fuck off on Saturday, "calm down on Sunday. "Go back to work on Monday. That's our shit." [audience cheering] But they had a motherfuckin' race riot with all white people on a motherfuckin' Tuesday. And we was fucked up. We ain't never seen no shit like this before. And from what I can gather, here's what the race riot was all about. The lily-white people, the pure-white people are mad at the other white people for so many interracial relationships that interact that, that they feel like they are losing control of the country. Well, here's all I wanna say to the lily-white people and the pure-white people. "Ain't nothin' wrong with off-white. "Ain't nothin' wrong with cream. "Ain't nothin' wrong with beige. Ain't nothin' wrong with taupe." Oh, no, there's a lot of taupe motherfuckers in here tonight. Ain't nothin' wrong with taupe. Keep it real. Taupe is winnin' right now. Obama was taupe. Drake, the rapper is taupe. I used to think Steph Curry was taupe till I seen that motherfucker jump shot. I said, "No, this nigga's pure." [audience cheering] But ain't nothin' wrong with taupe. Ain't nothin' wrong with taupe. The world we're livin' in... This is what happens in the world we're livin' in. If you lovin' one another, this is what happens in the world we're livin' in. Ain't nothin' wrong with taupe. Think about it. Buckingham Palace just went taupe. [audience cheering] ♪ They say hold up wait a minute ♪ ♪ Let us put some color in it ♪ ♪ Ah ♪♪ That's right. That's right. Buckingham Palace just went taupe. Prince Harry just married Meghan Markle. Uh, you know, Meghan Markle is mixed. Her mother's black and her daddy's a nigga. [audience laughing] Well, I mean, he white, but he did some nigga shit. This motherfucker faked a heart attack, then fuck around and had a real heart attack and couldn't even go to the wedding. What the fuck? If that ain't some nigga shit... [chuckles] I ain't mad at the taupe. I ain't mad at the taupe. I am not. I think we starting to do more white-lady shit. I think we are. Black women, we startin' to do more white-lady shit. We startin' to do more white-lady shit. Look at Wendy Williams, Wendy Williams fainted on national TV. Come on now, that's white-lady shit. Black women don't faint. That ain't our shit. What? You never heard of no black woman faint. Bitch, we don't faint. The most we do, we might buck our knees at a funeral, bitch. Ha... That's it. We ain't goin' no further than that. We went right to the biscuit behind us. [whimpering] That's it. Black women don't faint. Bitch, we don't faint. Even if we get woozy, bitch, we make it to our car. We'd be like, "Uh-huh, uh-huh, get my pocketbook. "Get my pocketbook. Get my pocketbook. "My sugar love. My sugar love. Give me a banana. Give me a banana." Yeah. Black women don't faint. That's white-lady shit. We don't faint. Now, we might fall the fuck out. And the difference in fall the fuck out and faintin', when you fall the fuck out, usually when you get up, a lawsuit is attached to fall the fuck out. [laughs] When you fall the fuck out on the way down, you got your lawyer on the phone, "Bitch, I'm fallin' the fuck out, bitch." Ah. Well, that's white-lady shit. Rick Ross been doin' some white-lady shit lately. I've seen, I don't know, is it me or it seem like every year around income-tax time, Rick Ross falls the fuck out. What the fuck is goin' on with Rick Ross? Last year his blood pressure was up. This year he had a tummy tuck. What the fuck is goin' on? I don't... [audience laughing] [Sommore laughs] No, that's white-lady shit. Come on, you know that's white-lady shit. [laughs] Ah... Oh. My family, we swirled the fuck out. We got all kind of nationalities runnin' through. Oh, I think we don't have, yeah, we don't have no Latino. See, I think, here's the thing, I think Latino women are naturally sexy. Lati... Ooh, yeah. Naturally sexy. If you don't believe me, watch Telemundo. Oh, bitch, you got to see the women on Telemundo. Everybody on Telemundo got on tight shit. Tight shit. Everybody wear tight clothes. [all laughing] Everybody wear tight shit on Telemundo. I accidentally came across Telemundo. I'm flippin' the channels and shit. All of sudden, I see all the women on there with tight shit on her, I say, "What the fuck is this?" I stop. I said, "I think they sellin' pussy on Telemundo." 'Cause here's the thing, I don't speak Spanish, but I know what sellin' pussy look like. You know what I'm sayin', I said, "I think these women are sellin' pussy on Telemundo." Oh, they're naturally sexy. Ha... As a matter of fact, they had one girl right on there. Called herself the weather girl. Now, she doin' the weather, with real big ol' titties. Her titties were so big, that whenever she did the seven-day forecast, you never knew what the weather was gonna be on Monday and Tuesday, 'cause her titties covered up Monday and Tuesday. So... And her nipple lay right on Wednesday. So you just go with the weather for Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday 'cause Wednesday was always nippy. [audience laughing] I think there's not a, a racial group that has more charisma than black people. No, no more, nobody has more charisma than black people. What? And if you ever, and if you ever not... If you ever don't feel black enough, go to Atlanta. Let me tell you something, Atlanta is the blackest city I've ever been to in my life. Love Atlanta. Atlanta's so black, they play The Temptations in the grocery store. And see, most people don't understand what I mean when I say that. They like, "What you mean?" Think about it, most of the time when you go to a grocery store, they play elevator music, music with no words. But not in Atlanta. You in Atlanta, you grocery shoppin', you standin' there, you a little bit confused 'cause you can't remember all the ingredients to your world-famous spaghetti, next thing you know, you be like, "Is that The Chi-Lites in this bitch?" [audience cheering] You fuck around, you dancin' to The Chi-Lites, you done put all that salad back. You got pork chops in that bitch and everythin'. Tellin' you. Fuckin', I love Atlanta. You know, 'cause we just swagged out like that. Here's what I love about black people. We are the most resilient race of people ever. I love that about us. What? All the shit we've been through? I love it. I love how, I love how we just, we just handle, we handle the Trump administration. See, black people, we were so nervous when Trump first got in office. We were so nervous, we wouldn't even speak about it amongst each other. It was just uneasiness. I had a white girlfriend ask me one day. She was like, "Well, why are black people so nervous "about Trump bein' in office? Trump hasn't said anything about black people yet." I said, "Let me explain to you how it feels to be black in America." "After eight years of the Obama administration," I said, "it feels like we are in the middle of a Spades game. "And for the last eight years, we had the big joker. Now we sittin' in this bitch, we ain't got no Spades." [audience cheering] And the world is Trump tight. That's right, we in this bitch. We got a hand full of cards with no Spades. We just lookin' at our cards, ah-h-h! We don't know what the fuck to play next. Ah-h-h! But I'm here to tell you. When you don't have no spades, that's when you find out what kind of player you really are. See, when you're a winner, you win. I don't give a fuck who's in office. When you're a winner, you win. I'm a born-motherfuckin' winner. I don't give a fuck who's in office. What? What? What? I play to win. Shit, I'm the kind of person, I renege with a straight face. You gotta play that shit with confidence. Ah-h-h! That's right. [chuckles] But say what you want, say what you want. Trump runnin' this bitch. Trump runnin' this bitch like Death Row Records. That's right. Trump is Suge Knight 2.18. And, bitch, anybody can get it. Anybody can get, anybody can get it. We ain't never seen no administration like this. We ain't never seen an administration so gangster. We ain't never seen or h-had an administration motherfuckers done quit, people done got fired, motherfuckers done went to jail. Trump cabinet ain't stable. [chuckles] Trump shit leanin' like he bought it from Ikea. Shit. You know that furniture at Ikea, bitch. You miss one motherfuckin' step, that's a whole another piece of furniture. You be sittin' there like, "It's supposed to be a bookshelf, but this shit leanin' like a motherfucker." Ah. Trump runnin' this bitch! Trump doin' shit we ain't never seen before. Do y'all know that Trump put a travel ban on the country with, against certain Muslim countries? Bottom line, Trump say, "We can't have no company." That's right, Trump put a travel ban on the United States against certain Muslim countries. Bottom line, Trump say, "We can't have no company." And the reason why I can identify with that, think back when you was a little kid. You knew your mother was fed up when she told you, "I don't want a motherfucker over here." I don't want a motherfucker over, that's what Trump has told the whole United States of America, "I don't want a motherfucker over here." Now, remember now, we don't have no Spades. We don't have no Spades. So, black people, I know y'all ain't still sittin' up here with your Muslim names when we got a travel ban on the country. Come on now. Shit! Y'all remember back in the '80s, everybody turned Muslim. Changed their names, stopped eatin' pork. Started wearin' Egyptian musk oil and shit. Poofy's bean pies, dashikis and shit. You better not be walkin' around here with your Muslim name when you ain't got no Spades. 'Cause I know a dude back in the day, changed his name to one of the hardest Muslim names out there. He changed his name to Omar Rahim Salam. I called his phone three weeks ago, he answered that bitch, "Timmy here." I said, "My nigger, that's what I'm talkin' about." I said, "Trump took this nigger back to Timmy." You better not be walkin' around here with your Muslim name when we ain't got no Spades. And, ladies, y'all gonna have to wean yourself off this hair weave. Y'all gonna have to let this weave go. These women ain't gonna keep lettin' their hair come over here when they can't come over here. You walk around here with all this Malaysian shit hangin' down your back, she's standin' at the gate like this watchin' her bang walk by. We ain't got no Spades. It's time to go back to cornrows and afro puffs. Get you some Sulfur8, get your edges straight. That's right. We ain't got no Spades. That's right. And I'm tellin' you. Trump, let me tell you, Trump has a personal, a personal agenda, he got a personal agenda. First of all, the motherfucker keep promisin' us the wall. He keep on promisin' us a wall. Now, I done seen all kind of Walgreens goin' up, but, bitch, I ain't seen the wall yet. But he keep on promisin' us a wall. Well, think about it, he has a, he ha-has a very specific agenda. Soon as he walked in, it's like he walked in with a eraser. Just trying to erase all Obama shit. Think about it. Soon as he got in, first thing he tried to get rid of, he got rid of all the LGBT rights. Got rid of the Iran-Contra nuclear agreement. Got rid of all that shit. Tried to get rid of Obamacare. I'm sittin' here, like, "Shit, he ain't gonna stop till he get custody of Sasha and Malia." [audience laughing] Say what you want though, the flyest thing about Trump, the flyest thing about Trump is his wife. Melania. Ooh! Y'all might not like that bitch, but that bitch be sharp. Whoo! That bitch be sharp. That bitch come out there, that be so motherfuckin' sharp, she only move her neck, that bitch come out, that bitch like a goddamn vampire. It's called corn fly. And she got the best poker face ever. I'm talkin' about straight face. And I like the way she don't say shit! And why it's so impressive to me? Here's why it's so impressive to me that she never says shit. I don't know how many of y'all noticed, but Melania speaks five languages. For you to be able to speak five languages and don't say shit? I know motherfuckers that don't speak good English and won't shut the fuck up. Don't say shit! And come on, let's keep it real. She married to Trump. She married to Trump, you know she done seen some stuff. Don't say shit. You know, she done heard some stuff. Don't say shit. I'm sure she done smelled some shit. Hm, y'all can't tell me Trump ain't came home couple of nights smellin' like he been in a storm... Wait for it, wait for it. The bottom line is, Trump is not presidential. He's just not presidential. He's runnin' the country like a business. And that's just, it is what it is. He's not a politician. He's a motherfuckin' celebrity. But we livin' in a celebrity-driven society. We listen to Kanye West and not Cornel West. That's where we at. It's where we are as a society. Trump is probably the pettiest motherfu... He's too petty to be the president. He really... See, as the president, you gotta be cool, calm and collected. Shit can't rattle you. Trump is a petty motherfucker. Ain't going... Petty motherfucker. And the reason why I can identify with his pettiness is, guess why? 'Cause I'm a petty motherfucker. I am, I'm a petty motherfucker. I don't miss shit, I don't forget shit and I bring up old shit. No, I'm a petty motherfucker. And I tell you, yes, I'm a petty motherfucker. And I tell people, "Look, you start some shit with me, you better be ready to go to the bus out, bitch." 'Cause I'm petty. And I got a motto, if I cry, everybody gonna cry. Everybody gonna cry. 'Cause I'm a petty motherfucker. And here's the thing, I don't mind admitting that I'm petty. I think if you don't admit that you petty, then you phoney. One thing I'm not, I'm not phoney, but I am petty. Lot of people have a problem admitting they're petty. But I got a test for you to prove if you a petty motherfucker. Number-one test to find out if you a petty motherfucker. If you order shrimp fried rice, and you count the shrimp... youse a petty motherfucker. You a petty motherfucker. If you sit there and be like, "Damn, "they ain't given me but eight shrimp. And this supposed to be a large." You be tryin' to bring other people in. "This supposed to be a large." Youse a petty motherfucker. Come on, you a petty motherfucker. Somebody send you a picture of their baby and you notice that the car seat is dirty, you a petty motherfucker. Somebody be like, "Girl, look at little Mae-Mae." And you be like, "Girl, no, look at that goddamn car seat. "Shit! That shit dirty as a motherfucker. He gonna need a goddamn tetanus shot." Oh, I don't miss shit. I don't miss shit. And I don't forget shit. I don't forget shit. I had a girlfriend of mine borrow $200 from me last year. Bitch tried to act like she forgot, right? Bitch called me, "Girl, so how is Florida? How's the weather down there?" I said, "200 degrees, bitch." [audience cheering] "It's hot. 200 degrees, bitch." Oh, yeah. I'm a petty motherfucker. I am, I'm petty. And it's, and listen, and it's hard. It's hard being my friend. I tell my friends. All, uh, my friends already know. It's hard being my friend. But other petty motherfuckers gonna feel me on this 'cause I got rules and regulations for my friends. If I don't fuck with that bitch, we don't fuck with that bitch. That's it! That's it. Third-grade petty, bitch. Third-grade petty. If I don't fuck with that bitch, we don't fuck with that bitch. That's it. That's right. I know it. An-and listen, as I get older, I'm tryin' to get out of my pettiness. I really am. I'm really trying to get away from it 'cause I... You ever hear people have say... You ever hear people say the saying, "You could cut your nose off to spite your face?" Like, I've done that so many times. Like, I'm the kind of person that'd do some shit like this, so let's say, I go to a soul-food restaurant. Finally get up to the line, I'm goin', I'm orderin' my food. I'll be like, "Okay, so let me get the fried chicken, "let me get the collard greens, let me get the rice and gravy and give me some potato salad." They be like, "Ma'am, we out of collard greens." I be like, "Damn, y'all ain't got no collard greens?" They be like, "No." I be like, "Fuck it. "I don't want nothin'. Fuck it. "I don't want shit. I don't want shit. I don't want shit. I don't want shit." Then I'd get in the car and be damn near, near tears, tears, like, "Bitch, why you just didn't get "some string beans or somethin' like that? "Why the fuck you gonna try to be the Rosa Parks of motherfuckin' collard greens?" You know what I'm sayin'? Just get somethin' else. Yeah. I am. I'm just a petty motherfucker. I try, I try to get over the pettiness, but I can't, I can't. I'm one of those people, I'm addicted to drama. Fuckin' love drama. I do, I fuckin' love drama. I'm addicted to reality TV. The more they fight, bitch, the more I watch. I fuckin' love it. I do. I'm sorry, I love, I love drama. I love the Internet. But you have to tread lightly on the Internet 'cause the Internet, let me tell ya somethin' about the Internet. Internet ain't nothin' to be fucked up with. It's really not. The Internet and I-I would... The thing about the Internet, I hear people always say... I said, "Were you on Facebook?" "Well, I mean, I fuck with it. But I ain't into it like that." But you really into it like that 'cause you think you ain't into it, but you really into it like that. Let me tell you somethin', the Internet and the Facebook and the Instagram, that shit will have you in false relationships, false beefs with motherfuckers, false competitions. And it's real simple to get caught up in some shit. Like, let's say you post a picture of your grandbaby, right? And don't nobody like a picture of your grandbaby. Oh, you in your motherfuckin' feelings. You look at one of your friend's page, you be like, "Okay, so, bitch, you ain't like "the picture of my grandbaby, bitch? Really? "Last week you posted a picture of some potato salad, bitch. "I liked your potato salad. "But yet you didn't like the picture of my grandbaby, bitch? Alright." And just that quick, you in some motherfuckin' beef. You just in this, and you just in this fantasy, you in a beef with the motherfucker. Real simple. Easy to get caught up on the Internet. Real simple. Motherfuckers, do you ever see people on the Internet go live and they ain't live? You done seen motherfuckers go live? They be sittin' in it like, "I'm live, y'all. "Hey! Hey! Hey! "I'm live, y'all! "Alright, I'm waitin' for more people to come. "I got two people. Alright, I'm live, y'all. Hey! Hey! Hey!" Ain't nobody comin'. "I'm live, y'all. Alright, I'mma wait on more people." And you be surfin' the Internet, you go past their page 'cause you see 'em talkin' and being all animated, you fuck around and go in there, and they holler out your name. "I see you, Belinda." You be like, "Ah-h-h! "Bitch, don't say my name. Bitch, don't say my name. "Bitch, I ain't in it like that, I ain't in it like that. Bitch, don't shout me out, bitch." Then the thing, the thing that killed me, the thing that killed me is the motherfuckin' filters. Oh! Grown people with filters on their motherfuckin' face. Everybody got the little halos and shit. The little flower halos with the gray eyes and shit. The one that killed me is the goddamn dog. I wish the fuck I would put a dog face on my face. I wish the fuck I would. Here's what I'm scared of. I'm scared I might look better as a goddamn puppy. You know what I'm sayin'? I bet there's some cute-ass motherfuckin' puppies on there. You fuck around and look better as a goddamn puppy. You meet a little dude, you be like, "Yeah I'mma go past the comedy show. After this comedy show, I'mma come past your house. He be like, "Yeah, but wear that little puppy shit "you be wearin' on the Internet and shit. "You know, don't be afraid to wear that little Internet shit you be havin' on the Internet." But you gotta be careful, and you fuck around and now he want you to wear little puppy shit, you go past the CVS to see if they got any extra little Halloween costume layin' around and shit. You all aggravated, "Y'all ain't got no dog shit layin' around?" "No, bitch. It's June, bitch. No." Right. But here's the thing you gotta remember about the Internet. You got to remember about the Internet, the Internet breeds group thinking. It breeds group thinking. And as a individual, you'd never want to lose your own individual thoughts. Never want to lose your own individual thoughts. Think about that. It breeds, it breeds group thinking. 'Cause you know, what you don't wanna do is wake up one morning, you a grown motherfuckin' woman and you don't know who the fuck you are. It's what you really don't wanna do. About five years ago, I started calling myself a chandelier. And here's why I call myself a chandelier. First of all, I call myself a chandelier because I'm not afraid to have my own individual thoughts. As a chandelier, the chandelier is the one object in the room that doesn't have to match anything. It doesn't have to match the carpet, it doesn't have to match the drapes, it doesn't even have to match the furniture. It just is what it is. And as a chandelier, you can turn on every light in this bitch. It takes nothing away from the shine of a chandelier. As a chandelier, I don't compete with nobody else. I don't hate on nobody else. I'm so busy trying to be the best me that I can be. And when you do that, you're livin' your life on chandelier status. That's right. Live your life on chandelier status. Live your life on chandelier status. And as a woman, I believe, sometimes you gotta think outside of the box. Sometimes you gotta think outside of the box. In life, we get comfortable operating right here. And this shit might not be working for us, but we see everybody else operating right here. So we be afraid to take a chance in doin' some shit nobody ever seen or heard of us doin'. Don't be afraid to think outside of the box. I had a girlfr... That's right, I had a girlfriend of mine... Called me one morning, crying like a motherfucker. [crying] I said, "What's goin' on, girl? What's wrong? What's goin' on?" She said, "Girl, I'm just havin' so much drama in my relationship." I said, "What's wrong?" She said, "I've been with David for eight years." She said, "We've been living together for five years. "We got three kids. I know he loves me. "He shows me that he loves me. "I just don't understand why he won't marry me." I said, "Bitch, you got to think outside of the box." I said, "Marry that nigger while he asleep." "Marry the nigger while he asleep. "You know he love ya. "He show you that he love ya. "Marry that motherfucker while he asleep. "When he wake up, you be dressed in all white, "have a wedding band on his ass, throw some rice on his ass. "Be like, 'We did it, boo! "'We did it, boo! "We did it, boo!' Marry that motherfucker while he asleep." Telling you, think outside the box. See, what women forget is that men are human beings, too. Sometimes they are a little bit afraid, too. Marry the motherfucker while he asleep. Now see, at first, he gonna be a little confused. But you gotta be convincing. Convince that motherfucker that y'all married. He gonna go with the shit. He gonna go with the shit. You gonna hear him one day talkin' to his boy, he gonna be like, "Man, you know me and Brenda are married now. "We had no wedding, no nothing. She married me one night while I was asleep." Now, his boy, it's gonna fuck his boy up 'cause he ain't never heard of no shit like this. "Married you in your sleep?" Then he gonna say some ol' player-hatin' shit. "Man, I told you about sleeping on these hoes. I done told you about sleeping on these hoes." Marry that motherfucker while he asleep. I see women laughing 'cause they know it's a joke. But I done put some shit on men mind. Soon as they get in the car, they're gonna Google that shit. Can you marry a motherfucker in his sleep? Yeah. Marry that motherfucker while he asleep. And if y'all been in a relationship for a long time, he gonna bring this shit up tonight while y'all laying in bed. He gonna be like, "Look, I-I heard the little jokes "Sommore was sayin' and shit. "But you know I love you. You know I care about you. "I'm just trying to work on my credit. "Trying to get my CDALs and shit. [chuckles] I love you. I'm gonna marry you. Don't worry." And motherfucker gonna sleep like this, "Don't be with that bullshit. "I told you I ain't ready. I told you I ain't ready." [audience laughing] Marry that motherfucker while he asleep. Marry him in his sleep. But I love being a woman, I do. I love being a woman. I do. I love it. I love every, every minute of it. I love it 'cause I be, 'cause I be... Yes. I believe, I believe, women, as we get older, we get better. [audience cheering] Oh, yes. As we get older, we get better. As a matter of fact, all the older women in the house if you would, the women 40 and over, give the younger women a round of applause. Give them, all the younger women a round of applause. I lo... I... Hey, I love loo-looking at the younger women. Here's what I love about the women, the younger women nowadays. Younger women, with all the technology and all the fashion and stuff, y'all have the hair thing, y'all have the ability to look like a whole another woman every single day. Let me tell you somethin', when I was in my 20s, bitch, we ain't have shit but baby powder, gel and deodorant. Bitch, if you was ugly, you just had to deal with that shit. But y'all motherfuckers, y'all are fly. Y'all can have pink hair, long hair, short hair, anything. Y'all are fly as fuck. I love that. Love that about y'all. Here's my only, here's my only advice to younger women. Slow down on the plastic surgery. And the reason why I say that is because... Yeah, slow down on the plastic surgery because plastic surgery was originally designed for older women. Like, once you've matured and you've had children and you know, a little shit gravity drops and you wanna pick shit up and put it back in place. But now, more and more younger women, women in their 20s are havin' plastic surgery. And I'm sittin' here, thinkin' like, "Bitch, "you puttin' a alternator on a new car. "You ain't even drove this bitch hard yet. "You ain't even put the pedal to the metal "on that motherfucker yet. You ain't... "You know, you don't even see what it can really do yet. And you out here havin' plastic surgery." And my only thing is this, and I want y'all to keep this in mind. So you got out and buy new titties and new ass. But what you gonna do when your other ass show up? [audience laughing] But what they don't know it, older women, they got a whole another body comin'. So you now went out and bought a new ass. What you gonna do when your other ass show up? You gonna be out this bitch like a camel with two humps. [audience laughing] 'Cause you got a whole another body comin'. And lady and all the women, don't hate. Don't hate. The shit look good. Don't be hatin' on 'em. Don't see 'em and be like, "Oh, well, that ass ain't real." Let me tell you somethin', men don't give a fuck if the ass is real or not. Men'll... Men'll hit... Men'll hit that bitch with the price tag showin'. [audience laughing] He'll be hittin' you from the back and go, "Oh, my bad. "I think your price tag came down. I think your price tag came down." They don't give a fuck if it's real or not. And I'm tellin' you, this shit look good. Shit looks good. Shit looks so good, it's intimidating to some men. All men are intimidated by that shit. They don't really know, they don't really know what it is. They don't know how old you are 'cause you look flawless. Can't tell how old you are, you look flawless. They don't know if it's a man, they don't know if it's a woman, if it's a transvestite. They don't know what the fuck it is. So they be kinda confused like, "What the fuck is it? It's just too fuckin' perfect." But not my uncle. My uncle old-school G. My uncle said, "I ain't never confused if it's a man or a woman." He said, "If you wanna know if it's a man or a woman, "throw a basketball at that bitch. "If she catch that bitch in mid air like this, that's a man." [audience laughing] And for me, I'm never intimidated by younger women. And it took... I-it's the mindset that you have to get in. Here's why I'm never intimidated by younger women. 'Cause I know things about bein' a woman that you don't even know, that you don't know yet. And guess what? I ain't gonna tell you. [audience laughing] Some shit you just gotta learn for yourself. Ain't that right, older women, you be sittin' there like, "I done seeing this movie before." [audience cheering] That's right. And, older women, let me tell you somethin', be ready there. If you ever get in a argument with one of 'em, they gonna call you old bitch. So don't let it knock your socks off. Now, the first time they call you old bitch, you gonna think they're talkin' to a motherfucker behind you. They gonna be like, they gonna be, "Whatever, old bitch!" You gonna be like, "Oh, bitch. Well, who you talkin' to, me?" That's right. Them call you old bitch. Just be ready for it. Just don't let it knock your socks off. But I'm never intimidated, to be honest with you, I'm excited about gettin' older. I really am. One thing I'm not looking forward to is menopause, though. Oh, I got a girlfriend, that bitch speak like menopause is a gang, she be like, "Bitch, you don't wanna be fucked up with menopause." I said, "Well, what the fuck is menopause?" She was like, "Ooh, bitch, you don't wanna be fucked up with menopause." I said, "Well, tell me about menopause. What, what-what is it about menopause?" She said, "Well, first of all, you're gonna have hot flashes." I'm like, "Bitch, I'm in Florida with leather pants on. Bitch, I can handle a goddamn hot flash." [audience laughing] What? She was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then you gonna have mood swings." I'm like, "Bitch, I can handle a mood swing. Ain't shit, I can handle a motherfucking mood swing." She was like, "Yeah, but then your sex drive gonna change." I said, "What you mean by, 'Your sex drive gonna change?'" She was like, "First of all, you gonna wanna fuck all the time. Then you ain't gonna want no dick at all." I'm like, "Hold on. Wait a minute. Let's talk about that." [audience laughing] I said, "What you mean you ain't gonna want no dick at all?" She was like, "I'm telling you, you gonna go through "this one period in your life where you gonna wanna "fuck all the time. Then you ain't gonna want no dick at all." Now see, here's a thing about that. And all of us in here have heard older women, our aunties and o-o-our aunts and our mom say shit like, "You know, well, you know "I just don't want dick like I used to want dick." Now see, when somebody says that to me that they don't want dick like they used to want dick, this is what I say to them, "Well, when was the last time you was around some dick?" 'Cause see, it's easy to say you don't want dick if you ain't been around no dick. And I ain't talkin' about no lazy dick. I'm talkin' about some real dick. So you can't holler out you don't want dick if you ain't been around no dick. 'Cause to me, dick is a lot like chicken wings. You could be full, but if somebody put a basket of chicken wings in front of you, you gonna eat at least one. [audience laughing] You gonna sit there and be like, "I don't even know "why I'm eating... "I just ate a little while ago... "I'mma take the little wing part over there. "Girl, I'mma just take the whole motherfucker right there... "I'm way over my calories any motherfucking way. Just give me a whole another mother..." So it's easy to say you don't want dick if you ain't been around no dick. So here's my theory about life. And it don't mean shit outside of this room. This is just my theory. Here's what I think happens in life. You know, as we get older, our responsibilities change, you know? And you have all these things on your, on your plate. By the time you reach a certain age as most of us in here, you reach a certain age where, now you got children, you got grandchildren, your parents are getting older, you worryin' about retirement, you, um, worryin' about, uh, your bills, your mortgage. You got all these responsibilities. See, sex is 80% mental. So if you have all these things goin' on in your life, you don't have... Y-y-your mind is not on sex like it used to be. Think back when you had, you didn't have all these motherfuckin' responsibilities. You remember who the fuck you were. You was a goddamn beast. Bitch, you could fuck all night. You used to fuck on a twin bed, bitch. You remember your highlights. You was beasty in this bitch. You could hit six, seven positions in one night. You was a beast. But now you got all these responsibilities. So now your life has changed. And not only has all your responsibilities changed, guess what else has changed? Your weight class has changed. Oh, shit. The average person has gained at least 30 pounds since the first time you had sex. I'm gonna use myself, for instance. I, uh, I gained at least 30 pounds since the first time I had sex. I used to be bow-legged back in the day. I done ate to bow out of these bitches a long time ago. [audience laughing] Come on now, 30 pounds. Bitch, when you were 30 pounds lighter, you could hit all kind of positions. But now you done gain 30 pounds. So you got to have what I call heavy-set sex. [audience laughing] Now, before we go any further, I know gotta readjust the room 'cause I feel some tension in this, in this area over here. [audience laughing] I feelin' like in this area, somebody got mad that I told them they're done, uh, they done gained 30 pounds. If you don't believe that you gained 30 pounds, go down and tie your shoe and come up real quick. You gonna be dizzier than a motherfucker. You gonna be like, "Oh, my God, bitch. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, bitch. Oh, my God." Come on now, you done gained 30 pounds. You at that age, if you walkin' in the mall and your shoe untied, somebody holler out, "Your shoe untied!" you be like, "Mind your business, bitch!" "I'll tie it in the car." You done gained 30 pounds. So now you've got to have what I call heavy-set sex. With heavy-set sex, you gotta get you two good positions. You got to master your two good positions. Find you another motherfucker that got two good positions. Now y'all got four good positions. Get your two good positions. Master your two good positions. And every man in here know what I'm talkin' about. There's nothin' better than a woman that has mastered her two good positions 'cause every man in here know the difference between a woman that suck dick and a dick-sucker. [audience laughing] You ain't got to do this to no dick-sucker. As matter of fact, she will get mad. Ooh... "Hey, you throwin' me off." [audience cheering] That's right. Master your two good positions. Then to keep it real, I'mma keep it all the way funky with y'all tonight. By now, you should be reaching the levels of intimacy. And by intimacy, I mean, findin' out what you really like. Oh, you got to find out what you really like. 'Cause one thing about when you find out what you really like, it don't take all night when you know what you really like. Let me tell you somethin', in your relationship, if you reach levels of intimacy, y'all will have a bond that's unbreakable. That's why I'm never quick to judge relationships. You ever see people say, "Oh, I see his wife. Oh, I see his wife. She don't look like his type." I be like, "Oh, she might know what he really likes." [audience laughing] Ooh, 'cause you'd be surprised at the shit people really like. Let a man take you to-to the, to the level of intimacy where you find out what you really like. Fuck your stretch marks, fuck your rolls. Let him take you there. Like, one night, when y'all are laying in bed and y'all makin' love, and, ladies, right as you think it's over, he grab you by the neck. "Oh!" [audience laughing] As soon as you get ready to holler out, "Motherfucker, is you crazy?" he bite your nipple at the same time, "Oh! "Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. "Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That shit hurt, but it feel good at the same time." You be like, "Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God." That shit hurt so bad, you got your shoulder up, "Oh, oh, oh, oh." But it feel so good, you fuck around and go to work the next day, shoulder still up. "How you doin', darlin'? "I saw your grandbaby on Facebook. She gettin' so big." [audience laughing] This motherfucker got your shoulder up. Bitch, you ain't never had nobody have your shoulder up. You done found some shit... that you really like. You done found some shit you really like. As a matter of fact, that become your little callin' card. One night y'all have some great sex, you walk him to the car in the mornin', you give him a little kiss, mm. He be like, "You gonna miss me?" You be like, "You know I'm gonna miss you, ow!" [audience laughing] "You know I'm gonna miss you." Find out what you really like. You'll be surprised at the shit you really like. Like, one night, ladies, y'all are laying in bed, he tell you to grab his balls with your left hand and thump them bitches with your right finger. You ain't never thumped no balls before. [mouthing] What the fuck? You don't even know if you're doin' the shit right. You really wanna stop 'cause it ain't doin' shit for you. But you look up at him, he lovin' that shit. You done found what he really like. And you can tell it ain't the first time that he had his balls thumped 'cause it's tough like leather up under the bottom. Feel like a wallet up under that bitch. [audience laughing] You found what he really like. Like, I read a article, I read a article that said that couples that reach that level of intimacy, they usually stay together longer than a average couple. And here's the thing, I don't think that they love each other any deeper than the average couples. It's just that I think they try to avoid that argument. See, it's hard to argue with a motherfucker that know what you really like. As a matter of fact, if you ever over at somebody's house, a couple's house, and they've been together for a long period of time and they get into a argument, do me a favor, just leave. Leave, 'cause that's... Listen, them... They gettin' ready to say some shit, y'all, you really don't wanna hear. Just leave. Come on ladies, y'all know how that shit start. Soon as he come in the house, you could tell he had a bad day the way he slammed the door. Bam! He just start lookin' for shit. Nitpicking. "Man, why it's so hot in here? "Why you ain't got the window open? You ain't lettin' no air circulate." He just nitpicking shit. "You ain't even fold the clothes up. The clothes still laying on the couch." Nitpicking shit. "The dishes still in the sink." Then he say some old silly shit. "You been out here bein' all lazy." That's where you go the fuck off. You be like, "Lazy? "Motherfucker, was I lazy when you wanted me "to wrap a rubber band around your dick and thump your ball? Was I lazy then?" You be like, "Wow! "Wow! Wow! [mouthing] Wow!" He come back at your ass, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. "You talkin' that shit, but you ain't said our shit. "You ain't say that shit when I had you in a head lock suckin' them flat-ass titties, yo." That's when the dog get up and leave the room. [imitates dog whimpering] You just follow behind the dog. "I'mma call y'all later. I'mma... I'mma call y'all later, y'all." [audience laughing] Find out what you really like 'cause you'd be surprised at the shit people really like. Though nothin' surprises me anymore. Nothin' surprises me. Think about the Bill Cosby situation. They accused Bill Cosby of drugging women up and while they're asleep, he was havin' sex with 'em. Right? Well, think about this. His wife is still with him. All these allegations, his wife is still with him. But think who was his number-one supporter. Two weeks into the allegations, his wife did a press conference, wife did a press conference. And y'all know Bill is married to Camille. Camille is, is articulate, eloquently speaking woman. Black woman, very articulous. Educated black woman. Camille did a press conference and spoke so eloquently, she came to the podium, she said, "The man that you all are speaking of "in such a disparaging way "is not the character of my husband, Bill. "Bill is a great man, a pillar of the community. "He has been a father to national television. "He's a great man in the community and in my family. "That is not the character of the man I've loved and cared for over the years." I'm sittin' at home like, "Go, Camille. "You better speak up for your man. You better speak up for your man." But now let's keep it real. Bill is married to a black woman. And all that shit sounds good in public. But you know when she got home, she let that motherfucker have it. I can, I can just envision Camille ridin' home, smokin' Newports... practicing what the fuck she gonna say when she get in the house. She came up in that bitch, she slammed the door, she said, "Guess where the fuck I've been all afternoon. "Out on these streets defendin' your dumb ass. "No, motherfucker, don't try to calm me the fuck down. "Thanks for makin' me somethin' to eat "and somethin' to fuckin' drink. Thank you! "But I've been out on these motherfuckin' streets "defendin' your dumb ass, you let another bitch "come out and say you done put some shit... [yawning] "in their drink, makin' them fall the fuck asleep... "You got my fuckin' family member... [yawning] "You got my motherfuckin' family members callin' me... [yawning] [audience laughing] "I see you're up to your bullshit again. "Go get me a blanket. "And use a condom this time 'cause I don't trust your ass that well." [audience laughing] [Sommore laughing] Y'all, my name is Sommore. Y'all been great. Thank y'all. Thank y'all. Thank y'all. Hey! Thank y'all.
