VINCENT - I said three nights. - I still haven't found work. You have to go. - Vincent. - Yes? - Fetch me more, please. - OK. Vincent. Here. - Got everything you need? - Yes, thanks. Dinner's ready. Want to join us? Thanks, but no. Another time. Promise. Thank you. Pass the ball! Hope they're not tiring you! It's fine. Normal! Thanks. Can you do it? Thanks. We did a good job. Yeah. Hello! Hello. - Here you go, Vincent. - Thanks. Hi. - Lucie. - Vincent. It's my best friend's band. She's playing keyboard. I really like it. I like it. Can you put the fig tree there? That's it. Hey, you can't do that! Here. Did you make these? I'm pleased you came. Aren't you coming in? - OK. - Come on. And three and four! What is it? You OK? Coming? Don't say anything. You mustn't tell anyone. Can you do it again? Yes. Here. Watch out! It's like... I'm someone normal but stronger, augmented. - But I can't... - You can do everything better. I do everything better, I can do more. Better, yes. Better or more. But you can do stuff out of the water. It augments your strength when you're not in water. - A lot less, yes. - A lot less? When I'm out of water, I dry very quickly. So it lasts... Well, it... And if, for instance, only your feet are wet... Is your strength only in the part... that's actually wet or does it spread? If I wet your hand, your hand's ultra-powerful? It's... Yes. Doesn't it put you in a strange state? Mentally? Well, yes, it's... It's strange, yes. So you're normal now? Now I'm... perfectly normal, yes. A bit more. But you... I don't believe it! - Take this. - Thanks. I'll do the corner then I'm done, OK? Coming? What are you doing? Huh? Here we go. That was the longest caress in the world. Go on! Oh no! Fuck! What's this? You're doing my head in! It should only take 30 minutes, it's taken you 2 hours! That's enough now. Get out of here! - Don't talk to me like that! - What are you going to do? You don't give the orders! - Got that? - You OK? Yeah, fine. I'm getting tired of this. You're a bunch of jokers. And him, with his beer... - Just shut your mouth! - Yeah, right! You're breaking my balls, I'm out of here. - Go fuck yourself! - What? Where are you going? Hey! I didn't touch you, don't touch me! - Shove off! - Don't touch me, you! What's your problem? Stop! No! Bastard! - Shut your mouth! - You're not laughing now, huh? Wanker! Patrick! Call the police. A cement mixer! A cement mixer... I have to leave. I have to go. Does Lucie know about it? Yes. I've ruined everything. Don't say that, Vincent. A cement mixer... A cement mixer! Thanks, Vincent. Time to go. - Want me to drive? - No, I'm OK. Where to? To Lucie's. What now? Head for the lake. Go on! He's getting away! Go to the end! Sir! Police. There! He's there! Stop! Hey! That way! We've lost him. He jumped on a lorry. Hey! Sir! Sir! Vincent? I'm Lieutenant Le Brec. I'm coming up to talk to you. Vincent? I'm coming up. Don't come any closer. Are you going to throw the extinguisher at me? What I saw by the lake was... You... Lieutenant Le Brec? Lieutenant? You've lost your... your strength? Huh? No! Don't move! Gently! Hey! Move it! Come on! Shit! Hey! Fuck! Vincent! Yeah... Will she be there? I don't think so, no. - You're playing tomorrow? - I'm trying to avoid my coach. Want some? - If he beats you... - Yeah. Could I borrow your phone, please? Thanks. - I won't be long. - OK. He got out of the canal? - I don't know. - I think so. Thanks. Here. Look over there! I love it. What? Being here, with you. Will you join me? Yes. - Shall I drop you here? - Yes. Thanks. Subtitles: Eclair Media
