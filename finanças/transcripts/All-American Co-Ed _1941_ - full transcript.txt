Nothing arouses my ire. It's my desire to be calm. If I'm in the midst of a riot my nerves are quiet I'm calm. My nature is exceeding wild, but there's one thing that drives me wild. How am I doing? I'm a chap with a chip on by shoulder. When anyone looks at you. I'm a fighting man, a dangerous Dan McGrew. My physique may be weak. I'll admit I'm somewhat meek. But when someone greets you a high ya cutie, the green-eyed monster says do your duty. I'm a chap with a chip on my own shoulder. When anyone looks at you. How my muscles swell in the throws of jealousy. I may not be six feet two, haven't Sampson's hair, it is true. I'm a chap with a chip on my shoulder when anyone looks at you. Hey Tiger. You're out of step. Ooh! I may not be six feet two, haven't Sampson's hair, it is true I'm a chap with a chip on my shoulder when anyone looks at you. I'm a chap with a chip on my shoulder when anyone looks at you. How my muscles swell in the throws of jealousy. I may not be six feet two, haven't Sampson's it's true. But I'm a chap with a chip on my shoulder when anyone looks at you. That's it, ma'am. And the audience gave them a great big hand, too. Of course, for the boys, it was just another show, but for Kristen it was great publicity. Empty. That's very interesting, Mr. Holden, coming from a newspaperman. But, I'll have no cheap, undignified publicity at Mar Brynn. But it isn't undignified Auntie. I can't understand why we don't have more students. Well, it's because our girls are... well, men won't even come to our proms. Sure. You need regular girls. Not a lot of between you putters. Girls with zip. Let me remind you, both that through the study of nature, my girls develop well-rounded minds. Minds they can live with the rest of their lives. But Auntie, a girl doesn't want to live with a mind. She wants to live with her husband. Virginia! Ah, listen. Would you be willing to give away 12 scholarships? To 12 unusual girls? Well if you would help my school, yes. It will. I hope so. But I wonder... You don't have to wonder any longer. There they are. You need girls like that. Look them over. There's the Watermelon Queen, the Pumpkin Queen, the Orange Queen, the Lemon Queen, the Strawberry Queen, millions of them. What love tomatoes! Why is she called the Tomato Queen? Because she grew herself. That's how she won the title. Really? She's a very pretty girl too. Empty. Sure, there's queens like her all over this country. We could pick 12, and give them memberships and scholarships to Mar Brynn. Yes, Auntie. And they'll all be so outstanding. Well, it doesn't seem beneath the dignity of Mar Brynn. We could call them the girls most likely to succeed. That's swell. Now all we need is some quick notoriety. Notoriety? But dripping with dignity, like a public denouncement. You know, the way Harvard lampooned Hollywood? Let me think. Let me think. I've got it! We'll pick on the men least likely to succeed. You mean those mentally undernourished males at Quincton cavorting as girls? The Zeta boys! Great Auntie! I mean, pardon me. Write an article for your paper about them and spread it on thick. Call them dumbbells. Call them anything you like, and I'll see that the press picks it up. Now make them look ridiculous. And we'll head the article Men Least Likely to Succeed. But, do you think we should? Perhaps they will succeed. Aw, don't be silly. Everybody knows that Quincton men don't succeed. They inherit. Hey, fellas. Get a load of this. Can you imagine that? Some hick girls college is putting us on the pan. Where's Henry? I'm coming mother. Now look, we know you're the world's greatest dramatic actor, but this is serious. Quit hamming, will ya? Listen. "Girls, are you interested in horticulture? Perhaps you will be one of this season's festival queens to win a scholarship to Mar Brynn. Send us your pictures and credentials. They're just taking a crack at us to advertise their scholarship award. And we got to do something about it. That's right. Yeah. Well, I know what Gary Cooper would say. He'd uh... he'd say uh... I, uh... I, uh... I don't know how you people do things here, but well, uh... well, back where I come from, we act. Yeah. Now, now wouldn't it be too bad if this scheme of theirs should back fire in some way? Yeah. Back fire. What's on your mind? Why, uh... why some way to turn the tables on account of we won't let ourselves be treated that way. That's it. And we've had plenty of experience. We all just finished impersonating girls. Suppose one of the Mar Brynn candidates turns out to be a boy? Then one of us would go to Mar Brynn as a contest winner. And you, Henry... Are great at imitations. Mm-hm. Oh, no. Not me. I only impersonate men. Well, get a pack of cards and we'll cut for it. That was a great idea, Bob. You think it's possible? Ah, wouldn't that be something? Gee, can you imagine being in a girls school? Oh. I don't want to go. I have premium. You would think of something dirty, Mr. Bergen. You always do. Yes, but what? He's a wonder girl. You will give him the business. Give him the business. Now if I were in your place, I'd surely... Charlie, nothing crooked. Why Mr. Bergen, I'm a man of high honor. How did you even... Charlie, answer my question. Yes, but you don't... Charlie... Well... Charlie... Well... Yes, Darcy. And besides, you get a deck of cards, haven't you? Charlie McCarty. We'll fake a swell picture of a girl, with her arms full of flowers, which naturally she grew herself. You know, the beauty type. Well, we're willing to take our chances. And Bob, as president of the fraternity, I think it's only right that you take the first card. Oh, well there's no... Yeah, and who gets the first ace, goes. First ace? Agreed? Yeah. Take your pick. Well, it's kind of important, you know. Whoa. Well, let's make it two out of three. No, you won and you go as Queen of the Flowers. Gee. Madame. And Mar Brynn expects you to do a good job. And we know you won't let us down. Oh, I'm hooked. But that's all right, Bob. After all, it should be right up your alley. Hey. hey, look. Ace, ace, ace, ace, ace, ace, ace, ace, ace, ace, ace, ace, ace. Ace. Ace, ace. Hey, look. They're all aces. Here's another lovely Tomato Queen. Mm-hm, nice. I see. There's watermelon, strawberry, pickle, potato carrot, orange, lemon, and all queens. Spinach? The Tobacco Queen. Just to real All-American girl. Isn't she beautiful? What a lovely turkey. Give me the girl, and I'll give you the bird. Well, that's satisfactory. I never realized there were so many lovely girls with such amazing talents. Listen, there's only only 11 here. We need one more. Well, we have fruits and vegetables. Flowers must be represented. I'll take this. Queen of the Flower Bobbie DeWolfe. That's a very interesting face. That's fine, Auntie. Don't call me Auntie. I'm sorry. But what I was going to say was with all these pretty girls, you have to relax a little, and let some boys on the campus. Never! No men on the campus during school hours. Not while I'm president of Mar Brynn. Well, I'm a man. You're safe. Here, you guys. Come here. Come here. I want to show you something. Hey! Shh! Fellas, here he comes. He's coming. Is he in a good mood? I don't know. But he sure wasn't when we were helping him into her clothes. Let go of me, will ya? I'm not going to run away. The fraternity will never forget this It was your idea and you're the only one that could do it. Make Mar Brynn look like a sucker. Yeah, sucker is right. And I'm it. And I'm not going to go through with it. Oh, yes you will. Don't trip again there, dearie. Or we'll give you the work. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Watch your little temper. Aw, you can't back out now. Besides you look like Ginger Rogers. More or less. And think of the fun you'll have. Yeah, fun. I'll probably land in jail. Oh, now wouldn't that be too bad. Now remember. You're doing this Zeta. We'll all be rooting for you. We know you can do it, so don't let us down. That must be she there. Yes, sir. Mmm, and a honey. Miss Bobbie DeWolfe, from Quincton Community. Queen of the Flower! Welcome to Mar Brynn special. Now don't forget, keep that baritone trap of yours shut. Pretend like you got a sore throat or something. Come, come Miss DeWolfe. Got to be going. Oh. maybe you better kiss your friends goodbye, huh? Goodbye, dear. There we go. Now we're off. My goodness, but you do have a lot of boyfriends. Just brothers. Just brothers. My, my. All aboard! Oh, hello honey. Hello. Here you are. Right up here. Number two. Now listen. I want to get a good night's rest and take care of throat, Bobbie. If I may call you that. Uh, honey. You know you're different than these other girls around here. Oh, you guy. Let me help you up. Oh, no you don't. I'll get a ladder. Yes, sir. Oh, early to bed and early to rise, that surely applies to me. Don't have to account sheep to put me to sleep. It's easy as A B C. When I rise and open my eyes, don't need an alarm clock's chime. Believe it or not, I'm up like a shot. When it's past my dreaming time. I'm up at the crack of dawn. Whistling. Singing. Da, da, da, da da, da. Cheerful as the sunbeams peeping through after dreaming all night of you. I'm up at the crack of dawn whistling. Singing. Hip, hip, doo, doo booty. Never saw the sky look quite so blue after dreaming all night of you. When I wake with your kiss on my lips, all my cares are in a total eclipse. I'm up with a cheery arm. Whistling. Singing. La, da, da, da. All your sweet embraces sitting around so I whistle and sing because there isn't a thing that I lace at the crack of dawn. I'm up at the crack of dawn. Whistling. Singing.

And now girls, to your dormitory assignments. And I hope you'll all be very happy at Mar Brynn. Well, I'll be seeing you all. Or will I? Now Bobbie, dear. Come with me. We're very much concerned about this throat of yours. Oh, not that door, my dear. That leads to the basement The one opposite. Do we feel like sharing a room, or would we rather be alone? Alone, please. There's a very nice little room right next to mine. Do we feel well enough to stay up, or would we rather go right to bed? Oh, to bed. Of course, if you'd rather we can send you up to the infirmary for a complete examination. Oh, no! No! I, uh, I'm just a little hoarse. Well you do sound more like a mule. Feel more like a jackass. Gosh! Boy, I'm going to get out of here. Ahh. Oh, goodness me, Bobbie what are you doing? Well, my throat is cold and I'm just keeping it warm. Oh, is that all? Well, look it. Do something for me, will you? I just cant seem to do with these. Fix them form me, please? Well, what do you want me to do with this? Well just fix my hair, silly. Say, you know what? I met a Zeta at Midwest over the phone. Gee, he sounded grand. He asked me for a date Saturday night. He has a friend. Want to come? No. Well, we could sneak out of here, I betcha. I know how those Zetas work. Well, you do have to be quick, but oh boy. It sure is fun. Well, goodbye now. Goodbye. You look very lovely. Goodbye. I'm Virginia Collinge. Welcome to Mar Brynn. Is there anything I can do for you? I hear you have a pretty sore throat. Yes. Very pretty. I mean... yes. It's very sore. Have you gargled? What on earth do you have here? It's just sort of a... well, just laundry. Oh. Well, I came to tell you about this thing over by the bell tower. Too bad you can't come because of your throat. Oh, it feels much better now. Well, if you do come, be quiet. It's against the rules and Auntie doesn't like it. I'm awfully sorry about your throat. And I can understand why you want to be alone. But it's too bad, because we were supposed to be roommates. What on earth are you doing? Just breaking in a new pair of pajamas. Oh, naughty, naughty. With your throat? To bed with you. Come. Oh no! Oh yes, yes! You have a very serious condition! Let me tuck you in. Shall I rub your chest? Oh no! Everything is so messy! Don't you dare get out of that bed, young lady! What is this? Why these is mens pants. What they're doing here? They got no business here. And a man's coat. Well, where'd these things come from? Uh, oh. Here's his shoes. I'm going call Miss Matilda, and tell her all about this. Mmm, hmm. Hello? Miss Matilda? There's a man's clothes done come down this chute. Uh, what, ma'am? Uh-mhm. Uh, oh no. No ma'am. I'm sure. Course I'm sure. These here clothes ain't made out of no organdy. Mhm-mhm No ma'am. Excuse me, Miss Matilda. I must've left the washing machine going. At least I hopes I did. Miss Matilda, as I was saying, there was a man's shoes... they was shoes, but they must've walked off by theyself. And listen Miss Matilda, there's something going on here that ain't the way I likes it. Now the irons are going. My, my, Miss Matilda. It must be my nerves. Hold a while while I turns off the iron. No, ma'am. I ain't crazy. Miss Matilda, did y'all ever find your hooty, [inaudible] I think he's here or somebody's here! Yes'm! I goes to cut the... the ironer off, and the shirt and the shoes is gone. Yes, ma'am. It was just like this, see? I goes over to the ironer to cut it off. And the shirts gone, and then I goes to the washing machine, and the shoes is gone. Ahh! This place is haunted! Miss Matilda, before your last wash lady leaves here, ya'll better come down here and get these pants. I just can't stand this place no longer! I go crazy! I just can't stay here! Aww, this is horrible! There goes the washing machine! Ahh! Ahh! [inaudible] Miss Matilda, somethings got me! Miss Matilda, come get me, please! Miss Matilda! What's going on in here? Are you crazy? What on earth is wrong? Now what's all this talk about pants? Where are they? I don't know where they is, but I sure know where they ain't! What is the matter with you? Ain't nothing the matter with me. This here place is haunted! First the shirt and the shoes goes by theyself. Then the washing machine and ironer goes by itself, then the pants go by itself! Now I'm going by myself! Goodbye Miss Matilda! Out of the silence come and cling to me Out of the silence come and bring to me That feeling of contentment when you're near and that feeling of resentment will disappear when out of the silence comes the sound of your voice My heart goes leaping I can't help but rejoice I'm up in heaven from the bottom of the sea when out of the silence you come to me. I'm up in heaven from the bottom of the sea. When out of the silence, you come to me. Out of the silence comes the sound of your voice my heart was leaping I can't help but rejoice I'm up in heaven from the bottom of the sea. When out of the silence you come to me When out of the silence You come to me Girls! We better hurry! Miss Matilda's coming! Back to the dormitories, girls! Hurry! Back to the dormitories! Shhh! What are you doing here? I came to see you. And right now, I'm holding a bell cord. Quiet, or she'll hear you. I never saw you in my life before. Well, I've seen you. I want to help you with this presentation. My name is Bob Sheppard. You see, I'm interested, in a way, through Bobbie DeWolfe. Oh. That is just professional. I taught her to sing and dance. Confidentially, though I don't like her much. Not after I saw you, Virginia. How did you know my name? Oh, I know a lot of things. Say, would you mind holding this, just for a minute? Be careful, now. It's heavy. Now. You know? You can't let go of that, or the bell will ring and wake up the whole town. And the old girl will here it, and come and find us here together. What's the matter with you? You aren't going, are you? No, no, no no. Just trying to resist temptation. You see, there's a little red man with horns behind me, egging me on. Pushing me with his pitchfork, shoving me forward. Forward. Like this. I don't see him. Well, he's there. Now, was that nice? Elegant. Well, wait. I mean, uh, perhaps I'd like to get in on this myself. Oh lady! Now you can hold it for the rest of the night. What a dirty trick. Well, goodbye Bob. If you leave, so help me. I'll let go of this rope. You can let go any time. That bell hasn't worked in 14 years. Boy, how do you like that, huh? It's terrific. Gee! "Glamorous Addition to Mar Brynn's Fall Festival." Get a load of that guy. He's doing all right. Good morning. Good morning. Well looks like all our little girls are as busy as b... Good morning, Mr. Holden. Good morning, honey. You know we're going to rehearse our presentation in here. Is that so? Well girls. Are we alre... Oh, Mr. Holden. Do you really think these spots mean anything? I don't know. But, I called a doctor. You would get spots at a time like this! Has anybody seen Bobbie? I'm worried about her. She was out all night! Well don't say anything. Keep it quiet. Hello fellas? Look, fellas, be reasonable, can't you? I know I promised, but I've fallen in love with a girl. She's like orchids covered with dew. Like... oh, like moonlight and violin. She's... Hey now, wait a minute, Bob. Hey fellas, looks like love has crossed us up. Now look, you took an oath. And love or no love, we can't let you get out of it. We'll send some of the local Zeta boys over to keep him from walking out. Right. Now listen, Bob. Wait a minute. It's only me, Virginia. I'll be there in a minute. I got to quit. I'm caught in the hothouse. Spend the night here. Wait a minute, Virginia. I thought Bobbie was Oh, look, Virginia. I know it looks bad, but just trust me, huh? And I believed you last night. Oh, now. For Bobbie's sake you'd better get out here, right now. Virginia! Are you sure those [inaudible] mean what you said? You can't quarantine the whole school, you know? What about our presentation? There's nothing I can do. Miss Bunny has measles. Must be put to bed at once. And the school is under quarantine. Sorry. It's too bad. It's just too bad. Poor kid. Oh, it just wrecks all of our plans. It's a pity. It's an awful pity. The very first time we try something like this. Well, couldn't we postpone the presentation? No, no. You can't do that. We'd spoil the publicity angle. We just have to make the best of it. I just knew something like this would happen. I'm sorry, Auntie. There must be something we can do. There is. You could have you presentation. Have it in here. You know, you can't catch measles from behind glass. Who are you, young man? I'm qualified to stage your presentation. I figured in presentations of my own. I know what to do and how to do it. Now, we could move all these ferns and plants out at one end, and have sort of a stage. Why we might even make costumes out of the plants. Yeah, this is the place, alright. What do we do know? Now, look. Our Zeta brothers at Quincton say the guys here disguised as a girl. We just keep our eyes peeled and when we find him, we give him the works. See? Get a load of that over there. Oh. Yeah. How do we get in? Oh, oh. Get in. Well, here, I got it. We'll grab one of these. Come on, you get one. Wait a minute. Can't get in that way. I wish you'd quit playing around. Say, we've been here three days and we haven't found that phony dame yet. I know. I know. I've been trying though, ain't I? Yeah. Trying to make dates with him. Goodbye now. Goodbye Bobbie. Hey, wait a minute. I got a idea. Ahem. How are ya, beautiful? Hello. Go on. Get out of here, will ya? Um, Bobbie? Yes. Why don't you like me? Oh, I like you, but I've seen you with the other girls. You play too rough! Bobbie? Yeah? Can you keep a secret? Uh-huh. Well, uh, I had to do that. You know, be a little rough with the girls. Oh. You should learn to control yourself. It's nothing like that, but Bobbie you know there's a man here disguised as a girl. And I got to find him. A man? Will you please get out of here? Go on! Scram! Oh, where am I? You're with me, be baby. Oh, dear! What's the matter, Bobbie? I won't hurt ya. That's what I'm afraid of. Will you scram? You're cramping my style. Yeah, I get it. Bobbie you're such a lovely girl. You play so rough. Oh no you don't! Oh no, Bobbie. Now cut it out. I know your type. Ow! Bobbie, now wait a minute. Bobbie. Ooh! Gee, Bobbie! Bobbie! Oh! That will teach you not to play fast and loose with me! Oh, Bobbie. Let me up. Please let me up! I don't see why you have to be so rough! Tickie! Ow! Bobbie! Tickie, tickie! Ow! Tickie, tickie, tickie. Oh, please let me up, won't you, Bobbie? Will you promise to be a gentleman? Oh, yeah! Bobbie, I'll promise anything. All right, now, but remember your promise. Oh! You little dickens. Now I got you! Ooh! Ooh! Hey, hey hey, hey. What's the matter with you? Why do you always keep coming around for just when I get going good? Didn't I... We're slaying them, Auntie. We're knocking them cold. Oh, Auntie, what's this? Don't touch it! That's a Dionaea muscipula. My, my. Due tell. Venus trap. Meat eating plant, to you. Poor darling. It's hungry. I've been so busy I haven't had time to feed it. Virginia, please. I want to explain. Explanations are not necessary. Oh, but Bob Sheppard is... Please, you're only making matters worse. I am grateful to Bob Sheppard for what he's done for Mar Brynn, but it ends there. Get into your costume. There's the overture. Virginia. Hurry up, operator. Will you, please? Hello? Quincton? Zeta House? Hello, you lugs. Thanks to you, I lost a girl. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know. Am I? Of course I'm going through with it. I'll get revenge, and plenty. Wait til you see the paper. Where's Bobbie? Probably in there with her boyfriend. Well, you better get on the stage. Your father's first number. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Come on! Ready! Yes, all right. OK. Great start. But what a finish. Tell your best photographers to get up over head. It'll make a sensational finale show. Go ahead. Virginia, listen. I want to explain. I was going to forgive you. But a moment after she... well, you were with her. What are you planning to do to this show? Nothing, Virginia! It's just that... That's my music. Our peaceful countryside is lonely as can be. Someone I shall mention marriage the attention of the men who write our history. The poor farmer's daughter, she's wasting her glamour and charm. Oh, dobbin and a plow and a piggy and a cow are the only one left on the farm. Oh, the poor farmer's daughter, she once had a bow on each arm. They took it on the lam, went to trade for Uncle Sam, and they left her alone on the farm. Her papa says the crop for the year is the top, but that doesn't ease her slumber. What good is a crop when your feet want to hop? You can't rumba with an old cucumber. Oh, the poor farmer's daughter, she really has cause for alarm. Oh dobbin and a plow and the piggy and a cow are the only ones left on the farm. The poor farmer's daughter she's waster her glamour and charm. Boy, what a job. I'll never get myself in a mess like this again. Of course it's garters. If I ever get home. Why, Auntie. It's going great, isn't it? But I better tell ya, Bunny got out. Who? Bunny. What's out? Bunny. Where? Where? Darn! Did you see that? Canned bananas. It's a double cross. Bobbie Bob He she. She's he. There's a man loose in my school. If the photographers see him, we're sunk. Bobbie! Well, catch her! Catch her! ... when your feet want to hop, you can't rumba with an old cucumber. Oh, the poor farmer's daughter, she really has cause for alarm. Oh, dobbin and a plow and the piggy and a cow are the only ones left on the farm. Grab a toadstool and park it. See the models from the farmers market. You'll find the price within reason. Get a load of what's cooking this season. Number one on the south parade. Shops will soon be selling. the more the watermelon. Hi Bobbie. Oh, Bobbie, I wanted to tell you something. Ah, go jump in a lake. Hey! Tiny! Tiny! I found him! That's him! That's him with those glasses on! Number two on the south parade, not by Schiaparelli. Get that cabbage around my lady's shoulders. Come with me. I got a great idea. Now we all for the symphony every note staccato Our creation temptation of tomato. Now here's one they will rave about native to Californy. Get that ribbon. It's in [inaudible]. Remember, kids, the sitting down Zeta trick on the last note of music. Now don't let me down. OK. What's the meaning of this? Ooh, sorry. Awful sorry. You realize now there never has been a Bobbie DeWolfe. Honey, don't worry about your show. Oh, dobbin and a plow and a piggy and a cow are the only ones left on the farm. Oh the poor farmer's daughter she once had a bow on each arm. But they took it on the lam... Come on, Bobbie. We've got you now. Bobbie! You shouldn't be here. You've got the measles. Bunny! Measles? ...you can rumba with an old cucumber. Oh, the poor farmer's daughter. She really has cause for alarm. Oh, dobbin and a plow and a piggy and a cow are the only ones left on the farm. Are you happy with the show? Yes. But there's something I want to say to you. Very good. Auntie! I'm sorry you lost your revenge because of me. But you should have a public apology for Zeta. Oh, getting you is enough for me. But don't you think your friends will be angry when they see those publicity pictures? They'll understand. Boy, oh boy, how do you like that? Huh? It's terrific. Gee.
