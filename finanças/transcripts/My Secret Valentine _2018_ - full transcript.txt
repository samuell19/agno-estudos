New Corected Subs & New Resync by TIGERHAM Now remember, Mr. Pike likes a chilled bottle of Pinot grigio at the table right as he sits. Thank you! - Hi, Laurie. - Hey there! Hey, things are looking great! You know, I was thinking, maybe we should back off ...of the Napa chard a little. It's Oregon! We have beautiful wines here that need to be experienced. Hi, Dad. Well, this is a nice surprise. You never call. I hope I'm not bothering you. Is everything OK? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just, uh... Look, I don't wanna take too much of your time. I know you're busy at work. But I was wondering, is there any chance ...you could get some time off this week? I've got some news I want to talk to you about in person. Dad, it's gonna be hard for me to get away right now. OK. That's all right. I knew it was a long shot, but I thought I'd take a chance. Well, can you tell me the news over the phone, instead of in person? - I'd rather wait 'til you're off work. - OK. I'll call you later, Dad. - OK, hon. Bye. - Bye. "News"? Hey. Hi, sorry. I was just... just talking to my dad. How is he? You know, he wanted me to come home but he didn't say why. Well, when's the last time you were home? It's... it's been a little while. - You must miss him. - I do. How can I help? In two ways: firstly, I need you to give me your honest opinion on this sauce. It's for the Valentine's menu, so it has to be perfect. Maybe a pinch of salt, but it's delicious. Really. You've got the best taste in the house after me. Now, the next thing is... you know the old steakhouse up the street? Yeah, I heard it was for sale. - Not anymore. I bought it. - What?! I'm opening a second restaurant! That is... that is so fantastic. What do you think about... running it for me? - Really? As your partner? - As my general manager. You know, you've done such a great job here... ...I would be crazy not to have you manage the new place. And there would be a raise involved. Maggie, I... thank you for thinking of me, but... I've been your GM here for five years. I've gone as high as I can go in this business outside of... ...having something of my own. I just don't know if the investors will go for me bringing in a partner. Right. No, I... I understand. Listen, why don't you take some time... ...go and see your dad and think about my offer? - Good morning, team! - Good morning! Stratosphere Beverages trounces the competition when it comes to distributing hip, inexpensive wine. But now, it's time to prove that we're more than trendy wine... ...and this is how we're going to do it. Grange Family Wines. They've turned down every company who's approached them in the past, but we just scored a meeting with them. Grange is an award-winning boutique winery ...that can bring us a new level of respect. Between their potential and our marketing muscle, we can make them a global name... if... we can get them to say yes. What we need is a sales rep to go there and do the unthinkable: convince GFW to sign with us. - Who's in? - I'm in. And that's why Seth is our number one guy. - Any other volunteers? - Taylor... I got this. Looks like it's all yours. This meeting's adjourned, I guess. Oh, Seth? A prestige winery like Grange will boost our public profile beyond party wines. - We need this. - Yeah. I'll lock it down in three days. You know there's a VP position opening soon? You nail this deal and it could be yours. Did I say three? I meant two. - Your flight leaves this afternoon. - The sooner the better. Grange is one of the only wineries in the Valley that is still owned by the original family. In fact, Truman Grange continues to work with the same vines first planted by his grandfather. Now, here at Grange, we like to focus on single batches ...to ensure that every bottle is made with thoughtfulness and care. Chloe? - You're home! - Hey! Everyone, this is Truman's daughter Chloe. Hi. Welcome. If you all want to head over to the tasting room, the other tour guide will set you up with some complimentary tastings. - Hi! - What a surprise! Are you here for the Valentine's Day Winefest? Wait, is that already happening? That's right, that's this week. How could you forget? I mean, it's only the biggest Valley event all year. Well, I've been working 24/7. I hardly remember what day it is anymore. Well, the important thing is you're here. I can't believe your dad didn't say anything! No, actually, I'm surprising my dad. You know, he said he wanted to tell me something in person. - Do you know what it's about? - No, he didn't mention anything - to me at the managers meeting. - Manager meeting? Wait, are you managing the winery now? Yeah. Your dad promoted me right after harvest. That's amazing! I'm so happy for you. Thank you! You're managing a fancy restaurant in Portland and I'm running my favourite winery. Just two old friends living the dream! - Yeah, living the dream. - We have so much to catch up on! - What are you doing right now? - I was gonna go see my dad. That was really the extent of my plans. Oh, well, he's gonna be out on runs all afternoon. If you wanna come with me, I was gonna go check out the cabin. We could catch up on the way. Yeah, I haven't... I haven't been out there since my mom died. - That was so thoughtless of me. - No, it's OK. It's silly of me to pretend like it doesn't exist. I'll drive. I'm so glad to see you! - What's it been, like... - Almost a year. - Yeah! - I know. I'm so glad to see you too. Well, we have a whole drive for you... ...to catch me up on all the handsome men in your life. OK. Well, that's gonna take us to the end of the driveway because there are none. Here we are. Just like you remember it? Yeah, it was my mom's favourite place. We had a repairman start work on the cabin, but he got called away on another job. So it's not perfect, but... it's getting there. We used to spend so much time out here. She liked to call it "our mother-daughter retreat". Well, if it makes you feel better... - ... it won't be sitting empty. - What do you mean? Well, with everyone coming in for the Festival and this place being so cute... ...your dad suggested we post it on a home rental site. Really? I guess he didn't like the idea of it sitting empty either. I advertised it as rustic and someone snapped it up. Even though it needs repairs? Yeah. I sent the tenant a message through the rental site... ...telling them that it still needed a little bit of work... ...but they were fine with it. I hope you're OK with someone staying here? No, you know what, Leanne? It's a good idea. I'll grab a bag. Look, I'll take care of everything so you won't have to be bothered at all. Thank you. I'm glad someone else can enjoy it. We'll add that to the list. Now, it's... broken. "Welcome... to... "our cabin. "Things will get repaired soon. I promise. "In the meantime, enjoy! It may not be perfect, but it's home". Chloe! I heard you were here. Hi, Daddy! - Hi, sweetheart! - Hi. Was your boss OK with you leaving? Yeah, she actually insisted on it. Well, I'm glad to hear it. You should work somewhere where you're valued. I should. - How's the car running? - It's running fine, Dad. Good, good. You're just in time to help me set up for dinner. Everyone's gonna be so excited to see you. You are staying for dinner, right? You don't have to turn around and rush back to work? I'm here for the whole week. I wanna hear your big news. What's going on? Well, I'll get to it, but you have to give a dad a chance... ...to enjoy having his daughter home for a moment. - It's good to see you. - Good to see you. Many years ago, my lovely wife Linda started this friends and family dinner to kick off the week of the Valentine's Day Wine Festival. So, raise your glass to Linda. And let's give a big welcome home to Chloe. You are the family in Grange Family Wines. Thanks, Dad. - Cheers. - Cheers. To a lovely night. I suppose that this is the best time to tell you... ...that this will be my last Festival. It's time for me to retire and turn the winery over to some new blood. Don't look shocked. It's time. - Way to bury the lead, Truman. - Ignore my husband. Congratulations. - Thank you. - So, what are your plans? There's plenty of time to talk about that. Let's just eat while it's still hot. Dig in, everyone. - Carrots? - Thanks. So, when did you decide to retire? Actually... it was your mom's idea. She didn't want me here alone. - But I thought you loved it. - I do! But it's not the same without her, and... well, I'm not getting any younger. So, what's gonna happen to the winery? Hey... have you tried this chard? - It's young, but the pear notes... - Dad... I may have agreed to a meeting with a wine company. You what?! You were always the one that said we shouldn't sell out... ...that we'd lose our integrity. Dad, I'm sure there are other options. Leanne! Sell the winery to Leanne, not just some random company! We don't have to sell, but... we should hear them out. Dad, please let me be a part of this at least. I just don't want some slick salesman coming in here and taking advantage of you. Sure, of course. Thanks. So, what's the name of this... ...this company that we have to hear out? - Stratosphere. - Stratosphere? Dad, the boxed wine people? This is the worst. This is the worst. Where's a guy supposed to eat around here? Everything's closed. This is a bad idea. I can help you with that. - There you go. - Thanks. Looks like we both found the only place that's open. What brings you here? It's the only place that's open. And I'm... I'm stress-snacking. Yeah. You? I'm starving-snacking. Well, I mean, if you... ...if you need some suggestions, I do highly recommend the popcorn... ...'cause it... it just pairs so great with... - Chocolate. - Yes. It's a perfect combination of sweet and salty. That's what I always say. - That's a subtle hint? - It's probably past their bedtime. Me too. Maybe I'll see you in the popcorn aisle some other time. I hope so. - Happy snacking. - You too. - Thanks. - Did you find everything? - That's gonna be... $3.75. - Oh, great. Thank you. Got a bag? OK, you guys make loading cases actually look fun. Every day here is different. What could be more fun than that? - What's your hurry? - What? Why are you... What are you... what are you... what are you doing? You just got into town. Why don't you take a "me" day, hmm? Maybe check out that mud spa down the road, get some shopping in? Why are you acting so weird? The wine rep is here. - Wait, now? - He's with your dad. Then I... I guess I... I should go meet him. - You don't mind him being here? - No. My dad feels strongly about taking this meeting. I want to respect that. Hey, what was that look? Nothing! I just thought you'd be bothered by a company taking over. Nothing's been decided. It's just a meeting. You know, when you said you were meeting with a wine company, I didn't know you meant right now. Where is this sales guy? He's right here. Snack guy? Also known as Seth Anderson. Chloe Grange, but you probably guessed that. It's good to see you again. - Do you two know each other? - Kind of. - No. - Well, that cleared things up. So your dad was just saying how you want to protect him from people like me. She thinks I'm a little too old to make decisions on my own. No, Dad, I don't think that. This is a big deal and I just... I do think that two opinions are better than one. And you think I'm gonna take advantage. I get it. I guess you play the bad cop to your dad's good cop? No, I'm not the bad cop. Is that part of your sales pitch? What, there's no... "Your wine is so special. The world should know you. We're the only ones who get you". - I was... I was gonna get to that. - I know your type. You're gonna swoop in here and think you can just dazzle the small town folks with your confidence and your false flattery. Let me guess. You gave yourself three days to close this deal. Am I right? - Two! - Does that work where you're from? New York. And sometimes. Well, Mr. Anderson, you are gonna have to work a whole lot harder... ...if you wanna be taken seriously here. It's good to see you too. - I think that went really well. - I'll show you around. - I was coming to save you. - Go, go, go, go, go! - He's handsome. - He is not handsome! He is the enemy! Not that I noticed his looks. Sure you didn't. So listen, I need a favour. He practically admitted that his just showing up... ...would be enough to make us sell. I got an email on the house rental site from the new tenant... You know what? I bet he doesn't even like wine. Wait, I'm sorry. Email? What were you saying? About some repairs that are needed on the cabin. Yeah, but I thought you sold it as "rustic". I did, but I guess the tenant found it a little too rustic. So if you wanna fill in for me in the tasting room, I could head over to the cabin, see what the problem is? You know what? No. Let me go to the cabin. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't want this sales guy thinking I'm too available. I wanna let him sweat it out a little. Hello? It's, it's... your landlord, I guess. Hello? I'm inside, so... I just didn't wanna surprise you if you're here. And if you're not, then I'm talking to myself, so never mind. "There's a lot of downtime in the country, "so I decided to help out and fix stuff. "I hope that's OK. Handyman". - Thank you. - Do you need a bag? - I don't need a bag for that. - All right. Bye bye! Great. All right. Taylor! Reception is pretty bad here. So, I met with the family today. Look... it's... ...gonna be a bit trickier than I thought, ...but... ...I'm confident we'll make the sale. You should probably start getting my VP plaque ready. Look, I don't know if you're getting any of this, so... I'm gonna let you go. Bye bye. What's this? Yeah! Love these. This is great! "You are my hero, handyman. Thank you! In Need of Repairs". I'm your hero, huh? OK. Well, then... I'll be your hero. Hey, Dad. Hey. Boy, you sure weren't easy on Seth today. Yeah, well, he needs to know that we aren't pushovers. I think he got that. So, how's everything at work? It's fine. "It's fine". You used to say, "It's great! It's awesome! It's the best job in the world, Dad!" I don't know. I've just been feeling like... maybe there's something else out there. Maybe I need a change. You know what I mean? You're talking to a future retiree. Look what I found. This was our first Wine Festival! Dad, what if... what if we recreated the original Grange booth for the festival? I mean, this might be our last festival, so what if we... what if we did this again? I don't know if people would appreciate something so simple. Come on! I wanna do this. Let me do this for you. I'd be honoured. Great. It'll be the best booth at the festival. - Promise. - OK. All right, In Need of Repairs... any suggestions ... on how to entertain myself? That's right. Suggestion taken. Morning! Bear claw? I know it's not popcorn and chocolate, but... - ... it's a close second. - What are you really doing here? I knew you were an early riser, so I thought I'd join you. No, I mean what are you doing here. Do you... do you realize that this winery has been in my family for 60 years? Do you have any idea what this means to us, or is this just another deal you have to close? Don't judge me so quickly! I might surprise you. Really? Then surprise me. OK. How about this? See that tall tree over there? That's an Oregon white oak. Right next to it, that's a western white pine. Great for Christmas trees. Are you reading this off of some sort of tree app? I was a divorce kid. My mom moved to the city and my dad stayed in the country. We used to go camping all the time. All right, all right. I'll... I'll give you that. Look, I might not know much about high-end wines, all right? Yeah, that's shocking. But I know a good story when I see one, and... I'm really good at my job. You know what? Being charming is not the same thing as being good at your job. You think I'm charming? I... Don't forget your bear claw. I'm taking this as breakfast... not a bribe. And you know what? I'm not your tour guide. Stop following me around. Hey. I saw you and Seth in the vineyard earlier. - Do you need to talk? - Nope. Nope, neither do I. Talking is so overrated. Hey, do you mind helping me with the booth for the festival? Of course! It'll be like old times. - Yeah. - Knock knock. - Are you still following me? - Thanks for the coffee, Seth. - Thank you. - No problem. You look like you could use this more than I could. No. No, thank you. It's all the quiet. I can't sleep at night. I need to show you something. Come with me. I think we're supposed to follow. OK. So, since my charm isn't working... ...I figured I'd show you how your business would grow once our company took over. We did a five-year forecast with in-depth analytics. We have an amazing team in place that will take over all day-to-day operations from your dad, and your current employees can stay on board if they like. This includes an enhanced benefits package and a pay increase. This is... ...this is a really great deal. This is a family winery. It's not about daily operations and honestly, my dad would be very unhappy with someone here who doesn't understand what we do. You know what? You're right. You're right. That's why... I get to know people on a personal level before going into business with them. I mean, we wanna build something special. Grow together. This is... this is my, my boss. - I should probably get this. - Yeah. Taylor. Hey. This is a really good deal. Someone's gonna have to give your dad a really good reason to turn this down. Hey, Taylor. Are you any closer to this deal yet? The dad's warming up to it, but the daughter is playing hardball. Listen, you need to figure this out if you wanna be considered for VP. - I know I do. - Well then, do what you do best. Convince Grange to sell. Hey, don't worry. I got this. What is he doing out there? Do you think he's posing the cane? He's pruning the vines. He's good. He's good all right. We wondered where you'd gone. Are you pursuing a new career path now? Why don't you join in? Start pruning? You're having fun with this, huh? Well, you said you wouldn't sell to somebody that didn't know the business. So, I'm getting to know the business... ...from the ground up. Look at this! I wouldn't do that if I were you. It's OK. I love my grapes... tart. You can spit it out. Looks like I'm the tour guide now. That's highly unlikely. Better watch out, you're getting your shoes dirty. It's OK. I love the dirt. I embrace the earth. I'm at one with the vines! - So, how's your buddy doing? - Seth is fine. Come on, this sign isn't gonna paint itself. - All right. - OK, the manual labour's a little overkill. It reminds me of when I was back in college, working on the construction site. You know, the more you do, the more I kind of just wanna say no to you out of spite. I can't help it. I've got a blue collar underneath this white one. Really? That's weird. All I see is a stuffed shirt. - Excuse me. I'm trying to work here. - Yeah, you can go there. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. He's just... unbelievable. You know what? I don't think he even wants to buy the winery. I think he just wants to drive me crazy. He's out there on a tractor with my dad, Leanne. Well, you gotta give him points for trying. No. I don't have to give him anything. What's your dad gonna do? Do you think he should sell? I don't know. Maybe it's the right thing to do... ...'cause who else is gonna run this place? But... there's just something about it doesn't feel right. You're talking about Seth? No, he's just doing his job in the most aggravating way possible. It's made a real impression on you. What? No! No way. No impressions are being made whatsoever... on me. - Excuse me? - I'll get this. Oh, no. I'll do it. - Hello. - Hi. What a great choice. This is our five-year-old Cab Fanc. The medium body and high acidity make it a beautiful wine ...to pair with tomato and barbecue sauces. I love this wine because the more you drink it, the more it reveals itself to you. You'll notice the plum and strawberry notes upfront, followed by a slightly spicy side, but you can't give up on it, because... you'll miss the chocolate finish. This wine is definitely not for the impatient. You really have to... to work to fully appreciate it, which is why it's one of my absolute favourites. - You should try it with the cheese. - Thank you! I forgot how good you are at this. - No. I'm rusty. - It didn't sound that way. Thanks. It was kind of fun, actually, to talk about our wine again. You ever thought about taking over the winery? Me? No. No, my... my dad would never go for that. Growing up, he was always... pushing me to go out and find what I love. What if what you love is right here? The plumber's on his way to the cabin. - Is everything OK? - Yeah, I just gotta go let him in. The tenant left a message about a leak. - Well, I'll go. - Really? Yeah. Yeah, I'll go. Otherwise, I have to stay here and hang out with my new best friend, Seth. - Point taken. - Yeah. I'll be back. Have fun. OK, so the kitchen's just here. "There's something comforting about a creaky house. You never feel alone". It's like you're in my head. - Did you say something? - No. Sorry. Sorry. So, what's the damage down there? Nothing major. Just a loose-fitting. - I'll be done here in a second. - Great. I did find this... tucked way back behind the sink. My mom made this clock. I'd wondered where it'd gone. It's got a little water damage, but with some luck, you'll get it working again. Thanks. "Have you thought more about my offer? Enjoy your break". I'm all done. Any more problems, give me a call. Great. Thank you so much. - Hello. - Hi. What can I get for you? I'll do the... the rib dinner, please. And could you switch out the mashed potatoes for a kale salad? I could, but not here. OK. - I guess I'll just take it as it comes. - Excellent. And do you have a microbrew list? This is wine country, honey. There's no microbeer here. We have wine and more wine. All right. Well, then I... I guess I'll... I'll do the Grange Pinot noir. Well, I think that's a good choice. Welcome to town. - It's that obvious, huh? - Yeah. I hear you've been going out to the cabin. Well, Leanne sure is... chatty today. You know, that was your mom's happy place. I know she wanted it to be the same for you. I miss her. I do too. I see her in you more and more every day. You have her eyes. You've always... always said that. And her feisty streak. And that. You know... she made me want to be a better man every single day. I know you'll find that in someone too. Is Valentine's Day making you sappy, Dad? I'd just like everyone to be happy. Seth wants to work alongside you tomorrow. You have gotta stop giving him attention. You're making him so much worse. I had fun with him today. And... it's been a long time since I got to show someone the ropes. He's actually a fast learner. Dad, I think you're forgetting he wants to buy the winery. Chloe... I'm not making this decision lightly. Dad, I know you're not, but... And I do appreciate that he's making an effort to get to know the winery. And I need you to at least pretend to appreciate that too. Believe it or not... I do. Good. You should... you should tell your tractor buddy to wear different clothes tomorrow. OK. Thanks Nancy. I'll see you tomorrow. Save me a piece of that pie, OK? What, just a piece? I'm gonna make a whole pie, just for you. You're the best. "Any chance you know how to make a sentimental cuckoo clock "cuckoo once more? Thanks, In Need of Repairs". Yeah... yeah, I can do that. Let me get that for you! You weren't gonna leave without me, were you? What? No. Why would I do that? Your companionship is all I dream about. - So you're dreaming of me now? - What? No. No, that... No. How do I look? Like you... you robbed a mannequin at the Boot Barn. I'll pretend that's a compliment. OK, listen. I'm delivering cases to our loyal customers today, so just... please stay out of my way and let me do my job. - You won't even know I'm here. - Really? - Yeah! - OK. Does GFW always hand-deliver? You know, there's companies that do this for you. Wait, GFW? - Grange Family Winery, GFW? - OK. Don't ever say that again. Say what? GFW? GF... W? OK. I will pull this truck over! To answer your question, the vendors are more likely to sell our wine if a personal relationship is established. You know, it's something called customer service. Maybe they don't have that where you're from. You can't resist a jab, can you? It's not personal. I'd be like this with anyone from your business. - Oh, no, let me get that for you! - Oh, no, I got it. Thanks. Now listen, these are long-time customers, ...so there is no need for you to say a word. Never crossed my mind. - Hi! - Chloe Grange! God, I haven't seen you in ages! Hey, I hear your dad might be selling the winery? Well, we'll see. I thought you might want a bonus case for Festival week. You're a mind reader! Your Pinot is the best seller in the house. - That's great news! - Who's your friend? Him? He's a... ...he's an exchange student... from Finland. Yeah. Doesn't speak English. Good job! Yeah. He's new. Let's go. We're gonna go now, Seth. OK. Take care! Danke! - You speak Finnish? - No! But neither did she. All right, what's next? OK. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Where is his order? Need some help? No. I have a system. You wouldn't understand it. I've got a system too. It's called a smartphone. I like to write stuff down because it actually helps me remember it better. Plus, I don't wanna have my head in my phone all day. I'm sorry, what? What? What did you say? That's very funny. Here it is. OK. Yeah. OK. All right. You have a product he needs. He needs you more than you need him. You have a product he needs, and he needs you more than you need him. What's wrong? You OK? No, it's... it's this owner. He has the most successful restaurant in town. He never buys from us. My dad has tried for years. Wait here. This is our special edition blend. You'll be the first restaurant in the Valley to have it. My customers expect something nuanced. It's a complex blend. It's a... Cab Fanc, petite Bordeaux. Well, I'll be! Is this the Grange blend? I've been huntin' this down ever since the blind tasting in Lyon. Lyon? You know, some people prefer Paris, but... you give me Lyon any day. What blind tasting? I was just there last month. I didn't hear about this. It was invite only. You know, for top collectors. - Yeah. - You're a collector? I'm a buyer for private collections only. Yeah, there's a lot of money in Texas oil. They just need a little help with taste... if you know what I mean, pretty lady? - Yeah. Sure. - Yeah. So who are you? I own this restaurant. Well... in that glass sits the wine that beat out wines from Bordeaux and the Rhone region. My top collector friends would flock to any place that carries it. Yeah. You know, maybe now that it's had a little time to breathe, you could give it another taste. It does have the complexity of a Bordeaux. - It just needed to breathe. - You're absolutely right. Well, you know, let's cut to the chase here. How do I get an entire case of this? You know... I'm so sorry. I think you're out of luck... ...'cause he was just about to buy both of the cases I have with me. Oh, come on, buddy! I mean, you can't spare a few bottles? I have a long-running relationship with Chloe's father's winery. I wouldn't want to do that to her. All right, all right. I know when I've been beat. So sorry. Well, you know... you win some, you lose some. Look, your place might need a little help with the decor, but... I'll be back with some of my friends, all right? Have a few of these bottles. You have a good one, pal. Bye. Take care. OK. OK, good. Thanks again! That was amazing. That was amazing! Wait, a blind tasting? Where do you come up with this stuff? I read about it online. I didn't do anything. I just set you up. - You closed it. Two cases! - I know, right? Two cases! I didn't think he'd buy a bottle, not to mention two cases! Thank you! Really, thank you so, so much. No problem. Your accent was overkill, though. What?! I've been working on that accent, OK? I thought my Texas accent was actually better than my Finnish. OK. You hungry? - Yeah, I kind of am. - Yeah, me too. I got an idea. Why don't you keep working and I'll go grab us something, OK? - Really? - Yeah! OK, great! - Yeah, it looks like a good place over there. All right? All right. Thanks. Any requests? I'm... I'm not picky. Anything. You're not gonna leave me, are you? I would never. Maybe. I might. I'm watching you! No, I won't. - Hey! Are you gonna be at the festival? - Hey! How are you. We'll be there. See you then. Hey! That place was great. I got some awesome stuff to eat. Tnx so much for doing that. What's going on? I just got text from Leanne, it looks like they putting us in some... corner at the festival I'm just working so hard to make it special for my dad, and they wone just hack us away. Where'd you wanna be? I wonna be in the center of all. Just like we were last year. I don't wanna be near the garbage cans. OK. Let's fix it. Really? What do you planning? Come on! let's go. OK Let's see where you are. O! Here it is. This is terrible. No-one are gonna be able to see us from, back here. You know, what? I have an idea. Here. Let's bring this over here. Yes, but people are going to know. Not tommorow. You just... casually set up... like you were supposed to be in this spot. It's for a good cause. OK. This is much better. Thank you. All Right. Now I'm hungry. Let's eat. What's your last time you were on a picnic? Honestly, can't remember last time I had a picnic. It's kind of cold, maybe we should eat something out? We have to celebrate those two cases. O yeah. We have to. You know, we have all that good food in the car. Why won't we... Follow me. I have an idea. This is a much more fun, then in the picnic. And a lot less windy. You're in for a treat. This is the perfect bite. What do you think? That it's delicious. Who are you? What do you mean? You blow into town with your... your city swagger... and your car salesman ways and then... ...and then you do all this. I can't figure you out. Why don't we stop talking about business? All right? I just, I never get a chance to relax. You know what? You're right. Neither do I. This little picnic would be delicious with a... ...a bottle of our Cab Fanc. - Have you tried it? - Yeah. It's good. "It's good"? "Good"? Yeah, it's really... it's really good. It's... fruity. "Fruity"? I'm sorry. How do you... how do you actually work for a wine company and not know wine? I focus on the entire wine experience. - OK? Not just the taste. - Right. For example, at Stratosphere, we're known for making boxed wine cool again. Boxed wine was never cool. That's just... That's very funny. You might be Truman's daughter... ...but... I think there's a lot more to you. Who wouldn't wanna live here, honestly, and talk about wine all day? I'm jealous. I grew up with crowded sidewalks and concrete parks. Yeah, but what about your camping trips? Those stopped when I was 15, after my dad died. I traded... life in as a good old boy to be a full-time city kid. Seth, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your dad. Oh, no. It made me who I am today. Now I just work as hard as I can to be as successful as I can possibly be. Success can... can be protective, but is it really fulfilling? Well... what do you think fulfilling is? Being passionate about what you create and not selling out. You know, I just never had a... ...family business to fall back on, I guess. I... you know, just because my family started this, it doesn't mean I haven't had to work incredibly hard. And... don't you ever... doesn't it ever bother you that... you come in and you just buy out the thing that people have put their heart and souls into? Actually, people... thank me for allowing them to grow far more than they ever could have imagined. Chloe, do you think I'm... I'm coming in and trying to take everything away from you? Because I'm... I'm just doing my job. See, that's what... That's what worries me. We should probably... - Sorry, we should probably go. - Yeah. I love it here. - Hey... are you OK? - Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks for today. No problem. - Let me. - No, I... I got it. Really, I'm fine. No problem. - See you after. - OK. "Your bill is racking up". OK. "Does your handyman experience cover advice on dealing with a jerk at work?" "Hello. I find that the best jerk repellant is doing the unexpected. "Instead of fighting back, smile. "The jerk is only a jerk if you let him get to you". Chloe, I need your opinion. I was thinking two reds and a white for our Festival booth, but... which ones? - I think... - Well, here's a thought. For the launch of our new canned spritzer, we would do "freefills". So, for every two cases we sold, we'd give one for free. Or we're so confident the product would sell, we'd just give it on consignment. Or not? Yeah... You know, to answer your question, I was thinking that we should do a cab, a Pinot noir for the red, and then a... and then for the white... Why don't we do rose? Do a rose for the white. Yeah, that's just what I was gonna say. - Good! - Good idea. - Thank you. - I need to talk to you. - Come here. - Yeah. So good. Are you, feeling OK? What's with this smile? Yeah. I just, I read that, you know... ...when dealing with someone like Seth, it just helps to smile. It makes you seem a little crazy, but... It's OK. Why don't we cover this up and if you don't mind, I'm gonna go... drop something off at the cabin. OK. Don't forget we're having dinner tonight. "I smiled... "until... ...my cheeks hurt". Is it just me, or have your cabin visits made you extra giddy? I don't know what you're talking about. You're blushing! What's going on? It's Handyman. Well, that's what the tenant calls himself. - You've met him? - No, not in person. OK. Explain please? OK, so he just took it upon himself to start fixing things around the cabin and that led to us leaving these messages for each other. - Like... flirty messages? - Kind of... - And you know nothing about him? - Nothing. I was hoping you did, since you handled the reservation and the emails. I don't even have a name. All the details went through the home rental site. Does anyone else know about your cabin crush? It's not a crush, it's just... entertainment. Although, I was thinking... ...that maybe it's someone that's in town for the Festival, 'cause all the locals know about the cabin. It's a small town and the tourists are easy to spot, so our list of potential Handymen is already narrowed down. So if we wanted to maybe figure out who it was... If we did... you know who's new in town? Seth. No. This guy is... is helpful and funny and fixes things. It's definitely not Seth. - Dinner's almost ready, girls! - OK. We search the emails? Yes. First thing tomorrow morning. OK. Now, most people post their own profile picture, ...while other people post pictures of their dogs or maybe a movie character. Our profile picture is of wine grapes. - Makes sense. - I thought so. - Who's Leo? - That's us. Leanne, Chloe. Leo. I know you like to keep things privet. so I didn't use our real names. - Very clever, Leo. - I thought so, Leo. Now, our tenant went with the more elusive sunset photo, and for their profile name, the cryptic T and S. And there's nothing in the emails they sent? - There's no clues there? - There's a phone number. Call it. Hello? A woman! Hello? I'm away from my desk right now. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you. Have a nice day. We can't leave a message. What would we possibly say? I thought Handyman was a guy. I mean, Handyman has to be a guy! There... I've seen his man's deodorant. There's nothing lying around the cabin that says female. Maybe he's got a wife or a girlfriend. And he didn't bring her to the adorable, rustic cabin on Valentine's day weekend? There's nothing there, I'm telling you, that says romantic getaway. Maybe he's so important he has his assistant book everything. Well, there's only one way for us to find out. OK. Fruity? No, that's not specific enough. Raspberry... Man! How does she know the difference between black pepper and white pepper? I didn't even know there was a difference! "Some thoughts on your jerk co-worker. "First impressions don't have to be last impressions. Sometimes, we try too hard when we are outside of our comfort zone". This is an emergency! I told Handyman we should meet. OK... Where to begin? You... you want to meet Handyman because... Because I... I... because there's a reason I have a crush on this complete stranger who calls himself Handyman. I just... I have to meet him and figure it out. OK... ...makes sense, considering. So, what's the plan? I asked him if we could meet tomorrow at the Main Street Tavern at 2pm. How romance-novel of you. It's really corny, I know, but... I blame the messages. Yeah. Well... good luck. "I think it's time we meet. "I'd like to thank you in person for all you've done. "Main Street Tavern, 2pm tomorrow. I'll be the one ordering the Grange Cab Fanc". OK. - Are you going in here? - I am. - OK. Go ahead. - Please, go in. - I insist. Really, you should. - I'm sure. Please, go ahead. I'm gonna go, otherwise we're gonna be here forever. So, I'm, I'm just gonna go sit over here now. - OK? - OK. Yeah. I'm... I'm gonna sit right here. See you later, I guess. - Hi. Something to drink? - Hi. I'll have a glass of the Grange Cab Fanc, please. Right away. It can't be... - And here we are. - Thank you so much. You're welcome. Hey. - Hi. - Late lunch? No, I'm meeting someone. A... secret valentine? Hold on. Wait, wait. Don't tell me. You... You're meeting with another buyer? - 'Cause that'd hurt my feelings. - Very funny. Why don't I keep you company while you wait? No, no, no! How about you just let me sit here in peace? - Hi. Something to drink? - Hi. Yeah, I'll do the... - ... what are you drinking? - The Grange Cab Fanc. The Grange Cab Fanc, that sounds perfect. - I will do that, please. - Great choice. This must be a pretty important person... ...by the way you keep looking back at the door. Why do you care? Why are you here? I'm here because... I've eaten at all the restaurants in town, and I haven't tried this place yet. Heard it was good. OK, look. My guest is... is expecting to meet me alone, so if you could just eat your food at the bar, or maybe another restaurant? - You know, it's so comfortable here. - And here we are. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Very comfortable. You're really enjoying this, aren't you? This person must be pretty interesting for you to be dressed up like that. - You look really nice. - Thank you. You too. Thank you. Interesting, but... not punctual. So you're not meeting a secret valentine, ...and you're not meeting another buyer, so... ...who... who are you meeting? Fine. If I tell you, will you just go away? Cross my heart. OK. I can't believe this. My family has a cabin. ...It's... actually a place that my mom spent a lot of time before she... ...before she passed. I'm so sorry to hear that. I had no idea. And here I was going on about my dad. No, I'm glad you told me that. Anyway... I have this pen-pal friendship with the tenant who's staying there. He calls himself Handyman. That's all I know. "Handyman"? OK. What do you call yourself? In Need of Repairs. OK. So you and Handyman, you're... ...you're exchanging notes? Yes, but it's no big deal! I just want to meet him so I can say thank you... ...for everything he's done around the cabin. Yeah. I hope he's getting a discount. OK, fine. Go ahead and make fun. I'm not making fun! I... I think... I think it's nice. He's lucky. Well, it obviously doesn't matter, because he's... he's clearly not showing up. You know, maybe he... maybe he doesn't think he's good enough, and he backed out. You know? Or... ...maybe he's hiding in plain sight. You know? He... What if he's that guy, right there? He just needed some courage, you know? Like, a lot of courage. Four glasses of courage. - What are you doing? - I'm being your wingman. What about that guy? Oh, no. That guy clearly builds robot sculptures... ...from objects found in his kitchen. That's oddly specific. And what about that guy? He lives with his mom. What about that guy? A hipster?! Really? You deserve better than that. Listen, I... I just have to say thank you for making being stood up so much fun. That's what a wingman is for. Thanks. I should probably go... ...'cause I gotta make sure everything's set for the Festival. - But will I see you there? - I wouldn't miss it. Take care. So, how'd it go? Is he cute? Tell me everything. He didn't show. - Then why are you smiling? - I didn't realize I was. You were gone for a long time. What were you doing instead? I ran into Seth. Seth? Like, the Seth you hate, Seth? Like the Seth I... I may hate a little less than before. - Huh... - No. No "huh". There's no "huh". There's nothing to "huh" about. And you're not at all curious about what happened to Handyman? - Why? Was there another message? - Nothing today. Well, then, I guess there's really nothing to be curious about. Hey, Taylor. You gonna come join us? I got a chocolate meringue pie with your name on it. You're just trying to fatten me up, Nancy. - Hi, Seth! - Hey. Hi. How are you? Seth... Seth? Are you still there? Yes. Yeah, I am still here. Sorry. I just found a place with reception. And... pie, apparently. What's the holdup, Seth? We need you back here with those contracts signed. Well, I gotta stay one more day. The Valentine's Wine Festival is tomorrow. It's the biggest event in town. If we're gonna buy the company, ...we need to to understand all aspects of the business, right? What happened to two days? It isn't like you to take so long. She's just been more challenging than expected. "She"? I meant Grange. We need this winery, and if you want that promotion, ...you need this winery, Seth. So... get it done. All right, Taylor. I'll let you get back to what you were doing. Nice chatting with you. OK, close your eyes. Come on, cover your eyes! I want it to be a surprise. - OK, OK. - OK. Just walk straight. - Hi, Chloe! - Hey! How are you? Good to see you. OK. Keep walking straight. No peeking, Dad! No peeking. - Are you peeking? - No, I'm not peeking! - I can't see anything! - Right. Sorry about that. OK. To the right! To the right! Go straight! OK, you can open your eyes. - Ta-da! - Chloe! Don't you think Mom would've loved it? Mom would be so happy. Thank you. Hi, Maggie. How was dinner service? Super smooth! The menu was a hit, but that is not why I'm calling. Guess what? I thought about what you said and I talked to my investors, and they agreed to back me with you on board as a partner! Wait, they did? I told them how invaluable you are! It's yours if you still want it. That happened fast. Hey, listen. I gotta jump off. I'll email you the details tomorrow. Bye! All right. Bye. - Morning. - Morning. - How are you? - I'm good. Good. It's that time, huh? Yeah... I guess so. You ever been fishing, Seth? You know, I never make an important decision without coming out in the water first. I even proposed to Chloe's mother on a fishing trip. You're a natural. I never expected that from you. I've been getting in touch with my country boy side... ...ever since I got here. There doesn't seem to be anything biting today. I think they can smell the city on you. Why don't you leave those contracts with me, and I'll give you my decision by the end of the day? You don't need a little more time? "More time"? I took you as a dealmaker with a sharper right hook than that. You know, I used to have one... Lately, I don't know where that guy went. You shouldn't be spending Valentine's Day with an old man. Let's get you out of here so you can check out the Festival. Chloe's there, in case you were wondering. - Let us know what you think. - OK. - We will. Thank you. - Take care. Look at this. - Hey, guys! - Hello. Hi! What do you think of our little Festival? - Does it stack up to your big city events? Well, I just got here, but, it looks like it stacks up to all the big city festivals. Thanks. Chloe, you should show Seth around. I can't leave you! We're too busy. Jeff? Why don't you tag Chloe out so she can take a break? - Anything for you, Leanne. - My Romeo! Go ahead. Have fun, guys. We got this. - Are you sure? - All right. Let's go. Thanks, Jeff. So, I was wondering if you were gonna show up tonight. Why, did you miss me? Like you miss a yapping Yorkie circling your feet when you get home. Oh, a Yorkie! I thought you would think of me more as a Doberman: fearless and well-groomed. Either way, you're still a dog. Last call for participants to join us for the wine and food pairing event happening on the main stage. The wine tasting competition! We have to do this. Come on, Doberman Anderson. You gotta help me win this thing! I doubt that but, what is this? It's a competition that tests your senses and determines which couple has the most knowledgeable palate. Is that it? Is the big city boy like, what, are you chickening out? Hello. Here you go. - All right. - Thank you. Come on! We can do this. Hi. Hi. Next person. There you go. Cabernet sauvignon. Merlot! We won? Thank you, guys. - Thanks! - Congratulations, Chloe. - Hey, Seth! Welcome. - How are you? - How are you? Thank you. - Hi. Congratulations. - Oh, Dad! - Oh, hey! Hey, it's my dad! Why don't you take him some champagne? - All right. - I'll be there in a sec, all right? OK. Dad! Congratulations are in order. - Did Seth say something? - Did he say what? What... what are we talking about? We won the tasting competition. We won! - Great! Congratulations! - Thank you! Wait. What were you talking about? Look, I... Chloe... I... I wanted to put this off until tomorrow. OK. Dad, you're scaring me. What's going on? I've been thinking about the sale. I don't think I have another option. Maybe you do. Dad, what if I took over the winery? What would you think about that? Chloe, I don't want you to give up everything you've been working towards. You have a good job in Portland. Maggie just offered me a partnership. There you go. You can't do both. You should do the thing that... makes you wanna spring out of bed, excited to start the day. That is exactly how I feel here. I think I had to go away and experience all that other stuff so that I could come back and I could appreciate all of this. I want to run the winery. Give it to me, not some company! I know I haven't always been present, but Dad, I'm here now. This is a part of me. Chloe... you have no idea how happy it makes me to hear you say this. If you'd only said it a little earlier... Don't say that. I signed the contracts. What? Hey, guys! Free hot toddies for the winners! Why wouldn't you tell me? What? No. It's... it's not his fault, Chloe. I wanted to tell you, but this wasn't the right time or place. "Not his fault"? If you hadn't come into town, none of this would have happened! Chloe, why are you so upset? This is great for everyone. You know what? If you don't understand it by now, I... You are just... You are an even better salesman than I thought. Congratulations. You got everything you wanted. Chloe... Chloe! I'm sorry, Truman. Hi Maggie, it's Chloe. Listen, I just wanted to s... I wanted to say thank you for your offer, but... I'm gonna have to say no. You need someone who's gonna give you 100%, and... that's not me. My place is here in the Valley. I... I don't belong in Portland, so... I hope you can understand, and... ...thank you for everything. I was just... I just turned down the job offer. I'm sure you can call her back and explain. I don't want to. I'll... work here, or get a... a job at another winery. I... I don't know. But I do know... I do know this is where I belong. This... This is my home. I'm sorry if... if I let you down. You didn't. You didn't. You just... You pushed me to be honest with myself. Will I always feel this way? Will I always feel this way? Finding what makes you happy isn't always easy. He's Handyman. Hello? OK, Chloe, you're never gonna believe it. I was hungry but I was sick of all the food at the festival, ...so I stopped by that little cafe... - I want you to have it. - What? Yeah, we have to keep it in town. I can't take it with me. I was talking to Nancy, the waitress at the Cornerstone Cafe. I know who Handyman is! In fact... I'm with him right now. - You are?! Where? - Right here at the cafe! OK. Stall him. Just... do whatever you have to do. I'm on my way. Don't you wanna know who he is? I blocked Seth's car! You said "stall"! Good job. - Chloe? - Hey, Handyman! You forgot something. I left it on purpose. But... I thought this contract was your purpose. It was... until I found something more important than business. You did? You, Chloe. Your passion is infectious. You make me wanna be a better person, find something more fulfilling. I had more fun being your Handyman in your middle-of-nowhere quiet cabin than I ever did in the city. Don't sell to Stratosphere... or to anyone else, for that matter. You should run the winery. You know it better than anybody else. That's... that's, of course, if you... if you want to. That's one of the things I want. So... what's the other thing? Well, maybe it's a good question for Handyman. What do you think Handyman would advise us to do right now? This. I was secretly hoping it was you all along. OK O, it's spicy at first. Smoothie and more mature. Sounds like us. What do you get? I have to say... "Fruity" This is our first bach of our winery and all you get is "fruity"? Common you can do better then that. Try it again. Close your eyes. Now, what do you get? Happiness... ... Laughter, and... ... a lot of love. This's just my new favored wine. To... To us. To us. New Corected Subs & New Resync by TIGERHAM
