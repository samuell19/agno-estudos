Can you wait for me for a little bit? When it's over do you want to eat ramen? Aachan. Do you really plan on doing it? It's for that person's sake. This candle is for kei-chan. This candle is for aachan. Kyo-chan! There's one for you kyo-chan. Move! Hey repairman! Hurry up and send the kids to the welfare home. Damn you! Hurry up and do it, idiot! Christmas is too extravagant for these brats! It's very peaceful without all of these brats around here. But this place is still the countryside. How about going back and working with the bubble baths? You would earn more over there right? Answer me idiot! I'll kill you! Forget about it. Forget about it! Hurry up and forget about everything that just happened! Alright? You guys didn't do anything. You guys don't know anything! Leave the rest to me please. Starting today, we are complete strangers. That's why we're never going to see each other again! Okay? Okay? This is a quiet morning in tokushima toyama-Cho. We have received news that a four year old child has died due to child abuse from parents. We're now crossing the warning tape... And two police officers from toyama county have entered the scene. The scene is the place where the ambulance is parked. Good work! Let me go damn it! That hurt! How dare you touch me, you prick! Hey! Let me loose from these handcuffs officer! I haven't done anything wrong! Don't you understand what you just did? It's discipline! Discipline! I didn't think that he'd die! You call not giving your four year old food, discipline? You killed your own daughter! Like I said, I didn't kill her! She just died on her own! Stop! Shikata! Shikata! I heard that you threatened the suspect! The lawyer wants to ask you some questions right now! I'm sorry about that. You idiot! You got too carried away! Don't worry about it. No, the chief is right. How about we go get a drink tonight? I'm sorry, I can't today... Is that right? You came? I came to get haru's clothes. Is that right? Mom gave me a call. I didn't answer. Are you going to the nursery now? I had a late class today. Don't overdo it. Later! You have one new message. Atsushi... You're not answering the phone... That's really troublesome for me. I know that I'm not qualified to say this but... You're the only person I can rely on... Help your mom, please! Hey, hey, hey... I won't make it back if I don't take care of the glass and gasoline. I'll be there for two or three days. I'm leaving it to you! When I get back, I'll give you your two months salary. I understand. I'm really sorry about dragging out your salary all the time. It's okay! You can go home today, ogawa-kun! I'll take care of the rest. Then, I'll go home first. Excuse me. Yeah. Good work! Good work! Here! This is ready for you. Are you okay? Don't worry. I'll do something about it. Are you going with your little sister? We don't have money for that. That's not it... She got this from her uncle last year. It's only 10,000 yen. Welcome home! I'm home. Azusa, I'm going to take a bus to see dad in toyama. Do you wanna eat squid Sushi again? I don't want it. You said it was yummy the other day didn't you? It's a great environment for raising children. You can also build your own house there too. It's very cost effective, ma'am! Yes! When's the delivery date? At the end of next month. Alright, I should get going now. Thank you! I wish you happiness! Thank you for your care! Good work! Good work guys. You don't have to do that ma'am! We can do it. Making tea is no big deal. Please have a seat! Okay! Wow, this looks good! I want to build my own home too! You need to get married before that! Is that the first thing? Of course! A man will work hard for the woman he likes. Like me. I'm gonna make her real happy. Umm... boss! You said something good in front of your wife! Yeah. I'll keep on saying it. Knock it off! Then are we gonna see the house first? Well, I still need to finish some work. When I do, I'll ask you guys to be volunteers. Of course! For real? Of course it's a joke! We'll give you money. Thank you! I won't give any money to you. Please do! You're a volunteer aren't you? Your wife obediently told me everything. If you're going to stay silent... Do you want me to read what you've done? What do you want me to say? First, this officer needs to apologize for what he did to me yesterday. I'm sorry about that. What? That's not it. Get on your knees. Nishikawa! Don't get too cocky! It's me! You're in there aren't you? Atsushi! Thanks for coming! Come in! Sorry... I accidentally went to that one place to borrow some money. They were horrible! They took my pension book. I thought they were going to wring my neck. Can't you crack down on them? You live close by. You could come visit me more often. How's it going with minako-San? If you're going to break up then do it cleanly. Then find a new partner. Then I can hug a grandchild... I don't want my mother to be like this. If you're lonely then find another man. You say some awful things! You're so annoying! Giving birth to you was a waste! Then you shouldn't have given birth to me. I don't need this! I'll die! You want me to die don't you? If you wanna die then die. Mom! Go to your dad's place! Understood? Mom! Mom! Mom! Are you okay? What's wrong? It's cold isn't it? Oo ho: I ne 0 I . . Oo . ;:. In: On I: I .

It's just a title. What about you aachan? What are you doing? I'm just a salaryman. Where's your business card? It's my day off today. I don't have it. What about your family? You're married aren't you? Yeah. Have any kids? I don't. I have one daughter. She'll be in junior high school next year. It seems like she's in her rebellious stage now. It's really troublesome. Are you here for work? I've come to see kei-chan. Keita? What is he doing? It seems like he inherited his dad's construction company in wajima. Actually... My company is struggling... I'm going to borrow money tomorrow! He has helped me several times so far. We're going to become strangers! That's why we'll never see each other again! Okay? Okay? Everyone is working so hard. I was right! When I saw you. That's why... Let's drink today! Are you okay? I'm okay! I drank a little too much! This is my stop! I can't really do anything for you. Aachan... Thanks! I'm okay... You can forget about it. Leave it to kei-chan. It's okay now. Later! There's been a lot of yukiwariso blooming here huh? They're a small but wonderful flower. You found a good place didn't you keita? Yes! Mari is going to become a mother! When we adopted her she was still breastfeeding. We didn't think this day would come. This is all thanks to you keita! This child is finally going to have a family of her own! Let me thank you once again. Dad! You're flattering me. Hey you! When the sunset falls into the sea level it's so beautiful! If you build a good home, I'm going to have to come here often. Are you going to see the sunset often? You want to see the face of your grandchild don't you? Please come and visit us often. Are you sure? If you say that then he's going to come here everyday! That's fine with me! Then how about we build a small house next door and live together? Mari! Can you do that? Seeing the sunset every now and then is enough huh? Right? Let's see the ocean! Mari! Mari! Hold on! Okay! Are you okay? Yeah! Then, I'll go to the construction site. See you later! Aren't you happy? I'm glad. If you're going to come then give me a call. I have things I need to do. Kei-chan! I have a favor to ask of you again. My wife is worried about minako-San. How about the four of us eat together again? Thanks for your concern but... I'm going to have to leave her alone for a little bit... I understand. She's the one who introduced you to minako-San. I'll remind her to leave the matter alone. I'm sorry... She isn't malicious but... She's super nosy because she used to be a policewoman. I'm even interfering with my subordinates family... These are bad habits of small communities huh? Excuse me! Onii-San! I just happened to have a job in this neighborhood. I hope you've been well. My wife asked me to do a favor for dad. He's already gone. You can't catch a squid with this small shrimp. That's not what I was thinking! How about you have some tea? Will do! Please take care of her! Say goodbye to mommy. Okay, okay... You're qualified aren't you? Why not go to a more serious place like before? There's a blank period right now. It's impossible. But the atmosphere here isn't bad. Is that right? Hey... You still have some baby clothes don't you? I didn't realize it. Can you throw it away? I understand. Wanna grab a bite together? I have time today. You solved the case didn't you? Yeah. I'm sorry. The person working the hight shift has the day off. I understand. Then let's do it next time. You don't have to worry about me anymore. You just left the hospital. You don't have to do it right now. Toyama headquarter is calling toyama central. This is toyama central. We're in toyama city. Near the entrance to the west side of kosu fishing port. Someone reported that there was a dead male with a lot of blood. Please rush to the scene immediately. Toyama central, understood. The victim is about 180cm tall. His age... there is a suspected homicide in the jurisdiction. The culprit is unknown. Each branch is doing an inquiry. He seems to be stabbed to death. We looked at the victim's driver's license... And determined the identity of the victim. He is 37 year old kawabata satoshi. He lived in 3-30, kita ikebukuro, toshima-ku, Tokyo. It seems like he was visiting a sister close by. She confirmed her identity as his little sister. It's a rental car isn't it? I found the ticket that I sighed in the glove box. The day before yesterday in the shop near toyama station... He signed a two-day lease. And the odometer? 312km. It's only 40km from toyama. He had some other reasons to be here huh? The only other thing we have is an empty wallet. And some paper bags from hokuriku bank. Is it a robbery or vendetta? What's wrong? You seem to be feeling unwell since you saw the body. You're acting like a rookie. I drank too much yesterday... Then it's all good. Excuse me... I'm kawabata! This way please. Please wait a moment in here. Haruna! Onee-chan! Why? Why did this happen to us? When your husband took the night bus three days ago... He went to toyama to see an acquaintance right? Yes. What is the name of that person? I don't know. Your husband didn't tell you? He was born in toyama. But he left his parents when he was 5 years old. He told me that he lived in a welfare home until junior high school. That's why he hasn't told me much about the past. The thing I know is... What happened after he started working on my house. He probably went to borrow some money from a former acquaintance. The victim went to Tokyo after graduating from the middle of seventh grade. After transferring multiple times... He started working in a glass shop owned by his wife's father. Then he married sayoko in 2002 and inherited the store. The reason why he came to toyama... Was to borrow money from a former acquaintance. It seems like he's borrowed money many times from this person in the past but... He did not tell his wife who the person was. That is all. Can I report relevant information? Go ahead. I contacted several students in the same grade as him but... Nobody seems to remember the victim. The class teacher at that time has passed away. That is all. I understand. Continue to investigate that matter. Next! Yes! At 3:30pm on the day of the case... The victim was given money from his wife as a gift for the deceased. And then he went to go see his wife's little sister kosugi haruna near the scene of the crime. According to her description, there was nothing strange about the victim. And he left after about 30 minutes. Did he borrow money from her? No, there was no mention of borrowing money. The victim was smiling the entire time. After leaving kosugi's house... The victim used his mobile phone to call back home at 4 in the afternoon. And he told his daughter azusa-San that he was coming back on the train in the night. According to this phone call and the bank paper bags left behind... The victim met the acquaintance. And he was holding a lot of money at the time of the crime but... The mobile phone and the bags are missing. That is all. How is the relationship between the wife and victim? There seems to be no problems. On the day of the crime she was at her daughter's opening day for school but... We have not confirmed this. Let's investigate with the motives of robbery and money problems. First let's find the person who the victim met. And thoroughly investigate the whereabouts of the victims in toyama. That is all! Yes! Shikata! Go with yamazaki to Tokyo! And investigate the victim's friend over there. I understand. When is the wife going to go back? She's going to go tomorrow. Umm... You're the clerk right? Pardon me but... what is your name? Ogawa hisashi. What about the person kawabata-San saw? Do you have any clues? No... The president didn't talk about the past. Have you had a dispute with others at work recently? There's no disputes. We're just a glass shop after all. At least... since I started working there... I haven't heard about any disputes. I can't provide any clues. Is that right? I don't think that there was anybody who hated the president. Yet... Is that right? I will talk to you later. I understand. When can my dad's body be sent back? Tomorrow. It seems like you had a phone call with your dad. Yes. What did you talk about? He said he was going to come back on the train in the night. Did he say anything else? He was talking about how he was going to give gift money. Why? I knew that we had no money. I told him that I didn't need it. Then he told me that children shouldn't worry about money. But he seemed to be in a really good mood. He said that he saw an old friend. An old friend? Did he tell you the name? He said that he wanted to see them but was never able to. That's why he told me he was going to work harder when he got back home. I should have been kinder to my dad... We don't have any useful clues at the moment. We can't find any contacts in toyama. It seems like he wanted to forget about his past in the welfare home. Yes, I understand. We found the sauna house where he was staying before the incident. Where is it? The main road of sakuragicho. The witnesses claim that they saw the victim in a ramen restaurant close by... With a man in his thirties... That man is probably the one who is lending the money. The whereabouts of the suspect and the victim are becoming clearer and clearer. That said, if there is no progress here, you should be the first one to go back. I understand. I'll go back tomorrow. You two will wait for the funeral... And investigate the people connected to the victim. Yes! I've always wanted to see you but was never able to. That's why my dad told me he's going to work harder when he gets back home. Yes? Atsushi... I'm sorry... I'm a no good mother... Your mother is pathetic... That's why... I drank medicine... What do you mean you drank medicine!? Yes? It's me. My mom called me and told me that she drank medicine. Medicine? I don't know what she's doing through the phone... I'm in Tokyo right now. Can you go see my mom for me? I understand. I'll go see her right away. Please! Hello? How'd it go? The doctor said that the amount wasn't that big so it's okay. It seems like she was drinking sake then took medicine. She didn't want to die at first. She's always causing trouble... Your mom is lonely. That's why she's causing trouble for you. I'm going back tomorrow. Don't overdo it. I'm okay. Boss! It's almost ready to start up! Here's the new list. How is the phone call history search going? We didn't find anything in the recent phone call history. Now it's being checked one by one in the past 6 months. We need to check the route of the rental car as well. He passed the center of the road and traveled 272km. We should be able to define the possible actions he took. There's no clues in Tokyo. It might really be a robbery. It's possible but... We must give priority in investigating the person he was borrowing money from. Adachi! Is this shikata? What's wrong? Last night my mother tried committing suicide. What was that? Why didn't you tell us sooner? Sorry. I was too flustered at that time so I'm calling you now. So... what's the situation? I still haven't heard anything from the hospital. I understand. Go back to the hospital! Contact after you've calmed down. I understand. Pardon me. Yes? Is tadokoro keita-San here? My husband is at the construction site right now. Where is the construction site? Excuse me but who might you be? My name is shikata atsushi, one of his old friends. Shikata-San? Is it spelled with the character for deer and field? No, it's spelled with the character for four and the character for direction. Oh, you're right! This is shikata too! Ah, I'm sorry! You asked where the construction site is huh? Excuse me. Is the president here? Who might you be? I just called him. Okay. Boss! You have a guest. Know who I am? My wife just called me. Long time no see. My child was born. Congratulations. Did you come all this way to tell me that? What do you need? Satoshi is dead. He was killed. Did you know? Yeah. I saw it in the newspaper. The night before he died, I met him by chance. We drank sake together. Is that right? He said that he was going to meet you. You met him didn't you? No... That can't be possible. He was going to borrow money from you! He said that you've helped him before! If you lie, I'll find out sooner or later. What the hell? You're acting like a police officer asking questions. I am a police officer. You're an officer? You're joking aren't you? It's true! Didn't you give him money regularly? You're acting like he was blackmailing me. Are you suspecting me? Assist us in the investigation if you don't want to be a suspect! I told you that I have nothing to do with it! Did you become a police officer to cleanse yourself? He met an old friend! "I always wanted to see them but never could.” It's you and I isn't it? Sorry to keep you waiting! Thanks! Here! Thanks for waiting! Thanks! I'll get your coffee right away! Very good! I'd like a coffee too! You want it hot? Hurry up and get my coffee. Geez... What the hell? Scared the crap outta me. What's up with you? How are you disciplining these brats? Discipline is good isn't it? Right? Ayama-chan likes ryoko-San. You're sure slow on the uptake aachan. I'm finished for the day. Thank you. Yes? It's yamazaki! We investigated all the people involved just in case but... Everyone had an alibi. We don't have any clues there. Is that right? But something has taken my interest. What is it? It's still not very clear. I'll investigate it in a few days. Using the road records, we investigated the route of the victim. There is a coffee shop called kiriko in wajima. The clerk was there at about 1pm on the day of the incident. He witnessed the victim and a man in an orange jacket come to the shop. He received a bank bag from him. This is a big leap forward! Do your best! Yes! I'm sorry for being so late! Have you been by her side this entire time? I'm going to make a phone call. I've caused trouble for you again. Inside of the ambulance... Minako-San told me that I can't die. She held my hand the entire time. Tell her I said "thank you". Why are you doing this kind of thing? I suddenly remembered my old self. Were you lonely? You're going to ask me that now? Sorry, atsushi... My mom asked me to thank you. We've been married for 5 years. But this is the first time I felt like I helped you. That's not true. You were right about my mom. She wasn't able to say she was lonely. She's always done what she wants. She found a man she liked and left me alone. She abandoned a perfectly safe child like myself. Do you know how lonely I was at that time? This is the first time you've told me about your mom. Did you want to hear this kind of thing? Your mom is the same as me. I've always felt that way. You were always alone in your own heart. That's why I always felt so helpless around you. But, if I could have kids then maybe things will change. Then something like that happened and I realized something... I just wanted children to get rid of my loneliness. You're not the same as my mom. Everyone is the same. You and I as well. That's why I just wanted to express my loneliness at least. Your mom might be stronger than us. My mom actually said sorry. I can also say that now too. I can finally say that you are lonely too. The toys we got recently are so interesting. Stop that! Geez! Give it back! Geez! I accidentally let your parents spend a lot of money on us... Don't worry about it. They want to do something for their grandchildren too. Oh! I felt something! Yeah. Alright, alright. I've been thinking... About the persons who gave birth to me. Were they as happy as me right now? I'm sure they were. That's why... Is it okay if I pick the name? I want to borrow that person's name. Sounds good? Yeah. Thanks! Come out soon. Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah! It's that person! The police came yesterday to ask about it too. Oh... speaking of which... The other guy seemed to call him aachan. Is that right? Yeah! Thank you! I have to talk to you. Go ahead. How is your mother doing? Fortunately, nothing severe happened. I'm sorry for making you worry. That's good to hear. Your hame was mentioned. The clerk of the ramen shop is a witness as well. What is your relationship with the victim? When I was a child, we were adopted by a foster parent. I got to know him at that time but I haven't seen him ever since. I met him that night by chance. Is that all? Yes. Then why didn't you say anything!? I was afraid of being suspected for our relationship. You're talking like a stupid child... If the chief finds out... Then you will be suspected and kicked to the side without a reason! At about 1pm at the wajima coffee shop... Someone withessed this man and the victim meet up. Don't tell me you know this person too? I don't know him. You're not allowed to participate in this investigation from now on. After this case is solved, be prepared for your punishment. Really? I understand. Someone named tadokoro keita showed up in the call records. He has an account at the hokuriku bank! On the day of the crime, 4 million yen was taken out of the wajima branch. That was very close to the coffee shop... What do you think? If he is able to lend 4 million yen to the victim... Then he should know about the victim being killed. If he knew what happened to the victim but didn't call the police... Then he should have a hidden reason! For now let's send people to investigate the relationship between this man and the victim. Long time no see. I'm shikata atsushi! Did you hear about this place from keita-kun? Has keita always been contacting you? She got in a traffic accident three years ago. At that time we were relying on him. I haven't forgot about what happened back then... The traffic accident had repercussions. It wasn't just her body. Due to high brain dysfunction... Ryoko's memories have become blurred. She doesn't remember anything about the past. That's why... You can forget about it too. You can forget about it now aachan. Leave it to kei-chan. It's okay now. It's good if you only remember the important things to you. Later, I'm going back to work. Rock, paper, scissors! Alright! Rock, paper, scissors! Alright! Rock, paper... Ryoko, I've been looking for you. You seem to be doing something good huh? Let me join too. We can use this to decide the outcome. That's shikata isn't it? What's the meaning of this? Does he know that's the person that we're monitoring? Let's confirm it with headquarters. What do you need? If you didn't kill him then why are you lying? What are you protecting? I told you that I have nothing to tell you. It's me. Shikata and the suspect met? Yes? This higuchi. Check out the situation. I'll be there soon! If they make a move then capture shikata and the suspect! Yamazaki is on the phone. He said they have new info in Tokyo. On that day... I was the one who killed that man. It was me! I've always been afraid of that person. If I became a police officer, I thought I could run away from all of that. But when satoshi was killed and they suspected you... I realized that being a police officer was a bad idea. What we did can't be cleaned up. You just realized that? You lived a nice and easy life huh? I've forgotten everything about you. I won't forget. We should have met sooner! I met that person. Isn't that the person you're protecting? I wish you could remember him instead. Ayama asked you to do this right? That person is important to you. In order to protect him you lied! I told you that it's not your business! Listen up. Just forget about it. Mari! Mari! Hey! Are you okay? Hang in there! Alright, it's okay! It's okay! It's okay! Alright, take it easy... Call the ambulance! The ambulance! It will be faster with a car! It's going to be okay! Hang in there! Alright! It's okay! It's okay! Hey! They're moving! Chase after them! Hang in there Maria... Please hang in there! Do your best. We're almost there. It's okay. It's okay. Hang in there. There seems to be an emergency. Yes, that's right! It happened when they were talking. Tadokoro's wife seems to be in pain! What's the current situation? Shikata is driving the tadokoro family. We're now in wajima city. The destination is unknown. It's okay. I'll definitely protect you. That's why it's going to be okay. Alright, alright! Just a little more. Just a little more. Do your best. Do your best! Please put her on the stretcher! How do we lay her out? Have her sit here! Have her lie down. We're in the hospital now. Alright, we're going to the delivery room! Do your best! Do your best! Shikata and tadokoro are in the suzu general hospital now! It's okay! It's okay! It's okay. Let's do our best together. We're going to turn! Shikata! What's the meaning of this!? Please! Please! Please give them some time! Do you understand what you're doing? What is it? You found the culprit? What do you mean? Yes? It's yamazaki! We've arrested the culprit in Tokyo! The wife and the clerk teamed up together to kill him for insurance money. They worked together to create an alibi. Then ogawa came to toyama. The reason why he came to visit his little sister... Was so that they could kill him there. The testimony from the daughter finally got those two to confess. I've been aware of their affair since before... But when I heard the conversation about the insurance money I was fully convinced. It's a really sad case. Yamazaki... I'm sorry about this. Thanks! Why are you sorry? Thanks a lot! Seeing her now... We suspect that it might be a severe hypertension syndrome found in pregnant women. Right now, the mother and child are in danger. We will do a cesarean section in order to get the baby out. It's still just 9 months... Is this okay? It's okay! There's no need to worry. Please! They arrested the culprit who killed satoshi. It was his wife and staff member. They were after insurance money. What the hell? That guy was fighting to protect his family! How detestable... You saw him didn't you? I don't have it that easy. I know that. How many times has it been now? I'll definitely repay you. You say that every time. So basically... You're going to close down your shop? The company was left by my wife's father... He treated me as a son-in-law and gave me a home. How can I close it down? The Olympics is coming up... I heard that the economy will be better in the future. Yesterday... I went to that person's nursing home. Although she's like that now... She's with aoyama-chan... And I could see how happy they were. That's why... I need to try my best too. Satoshi also talked about you. What did he say? He told me that you still don't eat bamboo shoots. My wife's name is mari. Three years ago... I saw the name nishina ryoko in the newspaper. A woman was injured in a car accident and then I went to go see her. It was my fault. I messed up ryoko-San's life. That's not true. It was because of that accident... That I can be with this person forever. Everyone has their fate. I have a favor I need to ask of you. For this person's sake... There is one thing I want you to remember. Then... Aoyama-chan told me... Mari wants me to borrow a kanji from her mother's name. Ryoko-San gave birth to her in a prison... Then sent her to foster care. Her father was that man. She doesn't know what kind of people her parents are. She only knows their name. Is that what you wanted to protect? I bought land where the yukiwariso grow. I'll create a new family there with mari. It's a girl! Your wife is stable too. Congratulations! I'll let you see them in a little bit. Thank you! Thank you... Congratulations... kei-chan. Thanks aachan... Thank you... I was his friend. My dad's friend? Your dad called me aachan since the start. It's been a while. I'm atsushi. Thank you... I finished another day safely. Thank you.
