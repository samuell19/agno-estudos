[wind gushes] [mellow music] [bear growls] [waves crash] [birds squawking] [somber music] [car engines rumble] [music continues] [key jangles] [sighs] [tires screech] [upbeat music on radio] [tires screech] [car door closes] [car alarm beeps] [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] [laughs] [door closes] [elevator door opens] [heart rate monitor beeping] [respirator whizzes] [speaking in foreign language] [choking] [gasps] [beeping rapidly] [intense music] [gasping] [keypad beeping] [sighs] [music continues] Oh, sh... shit! [thunder rumbles] [mellow music] [glasses clink] [sighs] [thunder rumbling] You are, uh, nervous. It's okay. When I first saw you, I said to myself, "This is a man that knows what he wants." He's just, uh, afraid. Well, I'm not afraid, it's just that I... I know, I know, It... it is just the way... things are. But a man must pay to get what he wants. Hmm? [clock ticking] That is why... we're all here, yes? Yeah. Go talk to her. Come on. She's very sweet. Leon: You'll see. [exhales sharply] [thunder rumbling] [dramatic music] Beatriz! [speaking in foreign language] [door closes] Hola. Hi. You wanna show me what you're drawing? I'd rather not. [music continues] [scribbles] It's Beatriz, right? Bedroom. Ah, li... listen, why, wh... Why don't we just talk first? Okay? You don't want to waste time with talking. It's okay. H... how old are you? How old do you like? No, that's not what I meant. I just want to get to know you, g... g... get to know who you are. - You like thirteen? - Come on, no, please! - Twelve? - No. [speaking in foreign language] Shit! Beatriz: Papa! Papa! [both grunt] [grunts] [grunts] Linda: FBI! Drop the gun right now, asshole! Drop it! [speaking in foreign language] - Fuck you! - Fuck you too, pal! - I die, she dies. - Hey, Leon! [speaking in foreign language] Put the gun down. Put it down! Nobody said anything about going back. We can talk about all that, when everybody's safe, okay? You've lied! You all lied! You don't want to hurt her, man. She's your daughter. - Okay? She needs you. - You don't know shit. I know you don't want this. None of us wants this, okay? Come on, you're a father. Put the gun down. [gunshot] Beatriz: Papa! Papa! [speaking in foreign language] Papa! Papa! Let go of me! Linda: Beatriz, no. - Come on, get back! - Papa! Papa! - Get her back! - Let go! Beatriz: Papa! Let go! [indistinct radio chatter] Papa Leon? Yeah, I, uh... Hold on, Serra, I wanna make sure I'm clear on this. The lynchpin, the key to your whole investigation is laying in a meat wagon with his brains smashed in? Linda: Vincent saved lives, sir. The fucker was going out messy. I don't care, Amistead. What I care about, is an eleven month investigation that has taken considerable resources on both sides of the border. - Is now well and truly fucked. - Not necessarily. Nussbaum: Don't add insult to injury. An undocumented child is not something we build a trafficking case on. Well, what the fuck is? Sir. We'll talk in the morning. [indistinct chatter] [car engine revs] [dramatic music] [car engine starts] [sirens blare] [horse gallops] [speaking in foreign language] [horse neighs] Mauricio. [laughs] Alex! [Chuckles] [speaking in foreign language] What's this? What's this? [speaking in foreign language] Oh, my God, has she grown! - Hmm. - What a sweet kid! Ah, Pinches horses... expensive. - Less than a divorce, I guess. - Yeah! [laughs] Nice work in Guadalajara. That city is a fucking shithole. Same as here. I hate cities, the crowds, the smells, the fucking gueros. - No of fence. - None taken. Country's better now, don't you think? Remember Tamalpais? [giggles] Those were Zeta scumbags. Crazy days. Fun though, huh? Uh, not exactly my idea of fun, Mauricio. [laughs] Right... You're sensitive. An artist a. [laughs] Jesus. Cheer up! Life is good now. It's calmer. More money, less blood. Our friends got you something nice. Mauri, you want someone else. I'm not up for it right now. Mauricio: Get up for it. Job's in El Paso. You're from there, right? Alex: Another reason to say no. I'm trying to tell you, I'm getting out. [footsteps approach] [speaking in foreign language] Uh, an iced tea, por favor. [horse galloping] [scoffs] The fuck? You drunk? U... uh, no, no, just tired. Alex. I need you on this. You know the town. It's too much. The job is for two. Don't you have a brother in El Paso? [laughs] Mauri... Are you spying on me? Mauricio: It's our job to know things, Alex. So stop talking this retirement shit. Men like us don't retire. [wind blows] [flag flutters] [car engine revs] [somber music] [engines rumble] [indistinct chatter] [engine revs] Receptionist: Here you go Mr. Marshall, you're all set. Anything else I can do for you? Mr. Marshall? [indistinct chatter] No, no, thank you. I'm fine. The room number again? 11-0-6. It's on the key holder. Ah, yes. Thank you. [dramatic music] [clicks] [cutlery clinking] Vodka Martini, please. So, too early in the day for a glass of wine? Or too late for a Bloody Mary? Guess that depends on what kind of day you wanna have. That's up to you, isn't it? [door opens] Are you alone? Not right now. Excuse me. [indistinct chatter] - Pleasant trip? - Let's get on with it. [phone rings] Uh, yes, he's here. He looks like what you'd expect. I'm sure he'll be fine. Alright. Bye now. [suitcase lock clicks] [suitcase lock clicks] Your people said this will be done quickly. And it will. I'm gonna need a little more specificity than that. No, you won't. The less you know, the better. [intense music] [suppressor clicks] [flag flutters] [engine revs] [door buzzer buzzes] [indistinct radio chatter] [children sob] [intense music] [door opens and closes] [speaking in foreign language] I was trying to save him. You are a liar. Look, Beatriz, what happened to you. What Papa did, it ain't right. Now, it's not your fault. - No child should be treated... - Papa said... "It is how you pay to be free." It was better than here. - I brought you these. - I don't want them! [Vincent sighs] Vincent: Listen, there is, uh, a special visa for... people like you to stay in the US, while we're working on your... You want me to tell. It's wrong that you're locked up here while the men who did things to you are out there. Papa said to never tell. [children sob] I'm gonna have you transferred to Child Protective Services, okay? They'll put you in a group home. Not lock you up. Now, I don't expect anything in return. Okay, if you wanna talk, you can talk. If you don't wanna, you don't have to. [speaking in foreign language] [water burbles] Looks like I'm going solo tonight. Ellis: I gotta get this done. I've got a permit filing downtown. - Downtown? - Yeah, I work, Wendy. Contracts don't just jump in the boat. Ellis: Don't wait up for me. - Ellis? - Yeah? - Her perfume fucking stinks. Wash it off before you come home, will you? [footsteps depart] [doorbell buzzes] Oh, shit! [gasps] Please! - Please! - You know why I'm here! It's... it's all a misunderstanding. It's always a misunderstanding. - M... Please! - Where? [breathes heavily] It's... it's in the safe. Upstairs. Please! Don't do this! [gasps] I didn't, I didn't say anything, alright? It wasn't, it wasn't supposed to go this far. If I'm here, it's gone too far. Ellis: It's here, alright! Okay! - Okay. - Open it! Alright, I just... Okay. [beeping] Look, if I give it to you... - Come on! - Alright. [both grunt] Girl 1: Oh, Dad? You home? [gasps] I'm going over to Annabelle's. [chokes] I'll probably stay over, okay? [chokes] Girl 1: Just letting you know. [intense music] [phone chimes] [ominous music] [phone clatters] [car door opens] [ominous music] [engine revs] [speaking in foreign language] Maybe you want to do that later. Uh-huh, I'm multi-tasking. [speaking in foreign language] Yeah, well I just don't wanna die today. [speaking in foreign language] How can you live in Texas and not speak Spanish? [speaking in foreign language] [chimes and explodes] Fucking owl! [engine revs] [camera shutter clicks] [indistinct chatter] [Vincent sighs] Hey, Danny. Where is he? Besides stomping all over my crime scene? He's out there. [indistinct radio chatter] Agent Serra, Agent Amistead, this is Mrs. Van Camp. Wendy, I guarantee these are two of my best. Just tell them what you told me. Ellis was... It was a robbery. The safe was opened. And you've told this to Detective Mora? I haven't talked to the police. I called Gerald first. Well, I'm... I'm sure Special Agent Nussbaum has made it clear to you, the more people we have working on this early on... the better our chances of solving it. Uh, so, I'm gonna go get Detective Mora, just so you don't have to repeat yourself. Excuse me. [indistinct chatter] [camera beeps] You wanna come outside and take her statement? So... your boss trying to get some or is he already getting it? That's real nice, Mora. Sexualizing the wife of a murder victim. No one asked for you guys. He just parachuted in on this. Yeah, couldn't agree with you more. This is your investigation. But let's just do this, together and then I'll get Nussbaum off your back. I don't need to cut a deal. Can you just not be an asshole all the time? Just say "yes", Danny. - Yes, Danny. - Okay, let's go. Vincent: Mrs. Van Camp, this is Detective Danny Mora. Sorry for your loss, ma'am. When's the last time you saw your husband alive? Last night... around 9:00. I... I was going to an art opening. And Ellis was... He was going to file permits. Sounds like your husband had something on the side. I assumed that he was, um, meeting a friend. You have her number, or his... Gerald: Linda. Let's have Agent Serra continue the interview. I can get you her number. Thank you, ma'am. You have any business dealings that went bad, anyone you know might wanna hurt him? Wendy: Uh, I... I... I don't know. [sobs] Please help me! What am I gonna say to Em? [birds chirp] [indistinct chatter] Don't expect too much. When the onset of Alzheimer's is this sudden... I know how it starts. [clatters] Hey, pal. It's me, Alex, your brother. You're looking good. Guess what? I found this the other day. 1969. Made me think of you. You remember that year? Huh? The draft? The Suns and the Bucks. Both tied for the First Round Pick. Down to a coin flip... Phoenix calls heads. [coin clinks] [taps hand] Yeah, it was tails. And the goddamn Bucks get Lew Alcindor. Yeah, I don't watch basketball much anymore. Can't say I remember the last time I did. [mellow music] [music continues] [door opens] [telephone rings] Hugo: My Captain called this morning. Apparently, I'm no longer needed. Good, I'm glad everybody's here. So... in light of what happened with the Papa Leon raid the Task Force is being reorganized. Detective Marquez will be heading back to Mexico. We're not done, sir. Cooperation with the Mexican Police has... We're done, Serra, I've spent the last three days getting an earful from Washington, facts are facts. This has been a wide reaching international investigation and we got nothing to show for it. [speaking in foreign language] You have something you wanna say, Marquez? It's not nothing, sir. We've gotten plenty in Mexico. [speaking in foreign language] Hugo: But as soon as we come into the US, things get, uh... I don't know, maybe your ears in Washington just don't wanna hear. [speaking in foreign language] It's pretty obvious the appetite for big fish, ends at the border. I don't like what you're insinuating, Marquez. I don't think I was insinuating anything. Was saying it pretty flat out. Hugo has a point, sir. We've never gotten anywhere with the US-based Padrote. If there even is such a thing. The word was Papa Leon served rich men. White men. "The Word," is that what you people build cases on in Juarez? We have Papa Leon on tape bragging about his clientele. Look, I know you take this personally. But the well's gone dry. I know you don't want to believe there's a white Padrote, but shutting down a case don't make it so. - Watch yourself, Serra. - We have a witness. What we have... is an undocumented minor in detention. What we have is a severely traumatized, undocumented minor in detention. And she's the only valuable witness we have. Gerald: When were you gonna tell me you offered Beatriz Leon a T-1 visa? I was coming to that. To notify me of the deal you're not authorized to make? With a witness in a case you haven't made? I thought helping kids like Beatriz Leon was part of our job. She's eligible. Gerald: The Task Force is done. And that is straight from Washington. As for Beatriz, we can T-1 her and move her to a group home, but you need to focus on the Van Camp murder. That's El Paso PD, every day. You want to help a kid like Beatriz? You play ball on the homicide. Yeah, okay. [indistinct chatter] Thank you, sir. Good. Coleman, Howe. You'll have new duty assignments this week. Detective Marquez, on behalf of the Bureau and the United States, I thank you for your service. [car engines rumble] [horns honk] [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] [engines rev] [ominous music] [distant children chatter] [speaking in foreign language] I saw the paperwork, is she a witness or victim? Both. I'll reach out to Social Services, see what we can do about counseling and school. That would be great. Is there any family on either side of the border I should know about? No, the father was a trafficker. - Hm. - I'm gonna say goodbye. I'll keep you posted. [footsteps approach] I think you're gonna be okay here. You asked me before, at Papa's, what I was drawing. It is a desert. I draw deserts. So you do, look at that. [chuckles] Keep it. I'll come back to see you soon, okay? I promise you. [footsteps depart] [car engines rumble] [intense music] [lock clatters] [music continues] [bed creaks] [gasps] [speaking in foreign language] [breathing heavily] [sighs] [motorcycle engine whirrs] [car engine rumbles] [engine turns off] [birds chirp] [bird caws] [door opens] [lights buzz] [sighs] For fuck's sake. [door creaks] [both grunt] [clatters] She's a child. - And that's a problem? - I won't do it. Your people knew who the contract was for. I fucking won't do it. Are you deaf? William: Well, maybe I'll call Mexico City, see what they have to say about that. Alex: No, no. No, you're gonna call the contract off. [laughs] The fuck I am. You're an employee! I don't take fucking... [grunts] Alex: You want this? Huh? You call the contract off. You really don't know what you're playing with. [laughs] Oh, yes, I do. [breathes heavily] Mr. Borden. Of 22 Bienveneda Avenue, Silver Springs. The girl stays alive. Or you're answerable to me. Asshole. [footsteps] No, no speeches or awards, please. My donation isn't about me. [car door closes] [indistinct chatter] Yes, you are correct. That is the amount I'm prepared to give, however any construction funding by this donation cannot be named "The Davana Sealman Wing." It must be simply, "The Sealman Wing." I'm sure you understand. Giving like this is generational. [elevator chimes] Is he still on the line? - Yes, ma'am. - Dr. Myers? Assistant: He cleared security three minutes ago. Have him wait, until I'm done with this. Thank you. I thought I was clear. Never on the office number. [phone beeps] [keys clacking] [computer beeps] William on speaker: He knows. That's a bit vague. He knows my name, where I live, and he won't do the job, and he's got... He's got Van Camp's flash drives. You said he wasn't going to be a problem. [sighs] I'm going to call Mexico City. That's one solution. An obvious and unsubtle one. What does he want? To have the contract on the girl called off. We do that, he turns over the info. There's something to be said for that. William on speaker: You can't trust him. I didn't say I trusted him. I said, I see his point of view. Look, I know what's on that drive. Randy's pretty obvious about his quirks. This is not a conversation I'm comfortable having with you, William. William on speaker: Oh, Jesus Christ, he knows! About the girl, about me. Davana: I'll handle it. And don't call me again. [keyboard clacks] [sighs] Man 1: Honestly, how it works, if you want my opinion, is this the truth? Mm-hmm. Thank you kind, sir. Okay, as I was saying, the truth... Well, well, wait. My bad. Cheers, again. [Chuckles] So, maybe we should just go upstairs, make some sort of a deal, 'cause at the end of the day, all I want is a blowie. Keep your voice down. Shh, we got a deal. I'll keep my voice down, but we still got to negotiate. Hey, leave the lady alone, pal. Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, pops. First of all, this ain't no lady. Which you're about to find out right about now, am I right. Babe? No, you're drunk. Go to bed. Okay, can you do us a favor, please and get the fuck out of here... [grunts] Fuck! Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you! [door slams] [jazz music on speakers] [indistinct chatter] [footsteps approach] Thank you. I'm sorry. It's embarrassing. He's just a drunk at a bar, being an asshole in front of a beautiful lady. Happens all the time. [sirens wail] [somber music] [indistinct chatter] Gracias. Tequila! [giggles] [speaking in foreign language] [chuckles] Oh, come on, at least I'm trying, Hugo. U-go. U-go. Ugo. They just don't wanna know, do they? Take the little victories. Beatriz is out of detention. [speaking in foreign language] Why six? You don't want to know. Actually, I do. I was working on a case in Juarez. The Dead Girls. Imagine, so many women disappear and you can't do nothing. They say everyone has their number. For the police they're all just numbers. Six? Emiliana Manteras was 13 years old. Left her job at a Maquilladora and disappeared. Just gone. Four months later, a couple of kids found her body in a dump. [eerie music] Her mother, her sisters. They were strong. They plastered Emiliana's photo on the walls of headquarters in all the city. The problem wasn't that no one knew what happened to the girl. Everyone knew. Emiliana got into a car with a soldier. Arturo Pontilla. Pontilla liked to party with the Narcos. I followed him. I built the case quietly. But since Pontilla was military, the indictment had to go to his commander first and they just fucking transfer him to Sinaloa. [music continues] Three weeks later, Emiliana's mother, aunt and three sisters disappeared. They hung those women from a bridge right in front of my office window. Jesus. You should learn the prayer. [inhales] [shudders] [breathing heavily] [intense music] [gasps] Maya: Hey! Shh! Hey! You're okay. Who are you? I'm Maya. You're at the hotel. - Hotel? - Yes. Just had a bad dream. You're okay. [engines rumble] [indistinct yells] [indistinct chatter on radio] [camera shutter clicks] [ominous music] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter on radio] [breathing heavily] [instrumental music on TV] That was nice, maybe next time you're in town... I won't be back. Alright. - Good luck then! - And to you. Woman on TV: A 13-year-old girl has been murdered in Sunset Heights. The minor, Beatriz Leon, had recently been relocated to a group home from an El Paso detention center. According to an El Paso police spokesman, the young girl's murder is... Was I here last night? Yes. What's wrong? Woman on TV: We're getting very few details... - You sure? - Yes! - I was here? - Yes! - All night? - Yes! Stop it, you're hurting... - I was here all night? - Yes. Listen to me. Very carefully. You have to leave now. You were never here, we never met. - Do you understand? - I understand. I have to go. Right? You stay away from this hotel for a while. - A long while! - Okay. - Do you hear me? - Yes! Do not answer that door for anyone. Anyone! [breathing heavily] [horn honks] Woman on TV: Well executed, it is worth noting that violence against children, is a calling card of the cartels across the border. Called on for comment, the Mayor had none. [intense music] [tires screech] [engine revs] [beeping] [gunshots] Maya: Hey! You forgot them, you forgot your pills... Get back! Get back! [silenced gunshot] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [intense music] [gunshots] [gun cocks] [gunshots] [car alarm blaring] [gunshots] [gunshots] [grunting] [bone shatters] [grunts] [groans] [grunts] [glass shattering] [footsteps] [door shuts] [gasping] When did you go soft, Alex? They'll end you for this. Happy retirement, Maury! Alex! [intense music] [beep] Alex! [explosion] [door opens] Goodness, you got the heart of a 35-year-old. At this rate, you'll live to be 130. I'll give you five million to make it 135. [chuckles] If you said, "Yes," I'd fire you. You know if I said yes, I'd want you to. My grandfather is a Abruzzese. He lived to be 104. Yeah? Lucky guy. You know, that all region, along the Adriatic, and Okinawa, Japan, they call those blue zones. Places that generally have a higher percentage of centenarians. I'm aware, Joseph. But why? Nutrition? Lack of pollutants in the air? There is no reason we have to age, to decay. Some medical professionals might actually argue that. Everything can be reprogrammed, modded. Why shouldn't human health be the same? DNA's an algorithm. Look, I'm not gonna tell you how to spend your money. [chuckles] Especially when so much of it ends up in your pocket. [engine revving] [indistinct chatter] I appreciate you giving me a call. I don't know what the fuck is going on in this town. Swear to God, it's getting more like Afghanistan every day. [siren blaring in distance] - Who are they? - Matched set. Mora: Jane and Joe Doe. He was in the driver's seat, blown the fuck up. She was in the trunk. .32 caliber bullet to the neck, jacketed with suppressor markings. Just like we pulled out of Beatriz Leon. Car's registered to a David Marshall. Rented at the airport. Some expat businessman out of San Diego. Probably the corpse in the car. We're running teeth on them both. Okay, this guy is drunk as a skunk. He, uh, pulled a .24 three times over the limit. So I need you to sign off on the report before you go. Mora: You got it. [indistinct chatter] - What's that? - Found them on the floor. It didn't match anything on our database, so the lab is running chem-test. If that's a prescription, it might help... The lab's on it, we might not be fancy, Vincent, but we ain't dumb. [indistinct chatter] I'll run the Marshall name through VICAP, see if anything comes up. I'll hit you up with the ballistics as soon as they come back. Same with the pill. Hey! Sorry about the girl, man. It was fucked up. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music on speakers] I couldn't go back. They don't love you in Mexico anymore? [laughs] You're not asking for my permission to stay, are you? - Linda said I had to. - Oh, well, in that case... Come on, you know what she's like. Yeah. Nobody gives a fuck about that girl, Vincent. Except you, me and Linda. I can do things you and her can't. You know? As a concerned citizen. From Mexico? Okay, concerned Mexican citizen. With questionable investigative authority in the United States. [both laugh] Yeah, Nussbaum is really gonna go for that. Fuck Nussbaum. I don't work for him. [panting] [thunder rumbles] [rain pattering] [silenced gunshot] [indistinct chatter] [sirens wailing in distance] [wings fluttering] [dramatic music] [door creaks open] [music continues] Ellis: Look, I promise you I had no reason to say anything unless you give me one. Sealman: What you're doing right now is incredibly stupid, Ellis. I hope you understand that. Ellis: You've left me no choice. I won't be cut out. Look, this doesn't have to be ugly. Sealman: Blackmail is already ugly. Ellis: Look, all... Sealman: Mr. Van Camp! Sealman: We are not negotiating. You've crossed a line from which there is no return. [dramatic music] [keys clack] [keys clack] [keys clack] [ominous music] [siren wailing] Looks like another .32 caliber. And I'm guessing it's also gonna be jacketed with suppressor markings. I'm gonna go talk to the wife. See you there. Do you think he's right? I'd put money on it. This is a problem, no question. Maybe a hitter cleaning up some shit. [indistinct radio chatter] I'll catch you guys later. Good idea. Nussbaum: Last time I checked, Serra, you were working the Van Camp murder. Last time I checked, sir, I work for the FBI. Was that Hugo Marquez I just saw? Listen... I think there's a connection between Beatriz Leon, the Jane Doe found in the trunk of the car downtown and this guy, William Borden. If this does turn out to be a jacket of .32, that's three people likely killed with the same weapon. Look, I get it, the girl. She's under your skin. Maybe you're a little obsessed... I'm just doing my job. Hugo thinks it's a pro, settling scores. We think it could be a hitter from across the fence. But you can't be sure. We can't, but if the ballistics match, and there really is a Mexican killer tearing ass through town, we might want to get ahead of that. And we're gonna need Marquez. Alright, do what you have to do. But I want updates twice a day. Vincent: Yeah. [indistinct radio chatter] Lab just came back on those pills. Diffadyl. Alzheimer's drug. Your shooter is loosing his shit. - Okay. Is the wife inside? - Yeah. Keep your hands away from the cage on that one. I don't know if it's medicine or just plain crazy. - Wanna sit in on this? - Sure. [footsteps] Mrs. Borden, I'm Agent Serra. This is Detective Marquez. I'm sorry for what's happened. Borden: Part of life, right? It's what they say... Hasn't really sunk in. Hmm, FBI. Fancy. - You an agent, too? - Liaison from Mexico. What's Mexico have to do with William? He hated the place. Well, that's what we're... hoping to find out. Have you noticed anything unusual happen in the past few weeks, where your husband's behavior has changed at all? Will's behavior hasn't changed in 20 years. No. Nothing. - What kind of law did he do? - Real Estate. Marquez: Sorry to ask this, Mrs. Borden. But do you know if your husband had any ties to prostitution? I have no idea. Sit down. Bill paying for it? Doesn't seem like him. Did your husband know Ellis Van Camp? I know Wendy. I see her at the same events. It's all one big cocktail party up here. You like cocktails, Detective? Margaritas? Pina Coladas? Vincent: Thanks for your help, Mrs. Borden. If you need anything, just give us a call. [elevator beeps] I'm afraid she can't be disturbed... Don't even fucking start. I've been calling you all morning. Borden's dead. Someone executed him. And if he got to Borden, then he's close. Jesus, mum... [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Just take a breath. [inhales deeply] Bravo. You need to leave El Paso. Immediately. Take the company plane. What about tomorrow night, it's all been arranged... Listen to me. Tomorrow, after the party, you'll fly to Geneva. Stay at the house and make arrangements for you to check into rehab there. Rehab? If things connect to you, and we have a problem, you will be working on your issues, which will buy us time to quietly hire very good lawyers. Besides... you need help, Randy. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Sealman: I know you are, baby. I know you are. Full ballistics came back. Same gun killed Beatriz and the Jane Doe in the car, but not Borden. Two .32s, two shooters. Trafficking, Vincent Serra. Alex: You're the one who took the girl to the group home. - Weren't you? - Who is this? Alex: Marshall. David Marshall. Tap and trace. Ah, David Marshall burned up a car downtown. Is that your doing? Alex: I can't keep doing your job for you. Vincent: What job is that? Alex: Borden, Van Camp. What they did to children. You're not doing anything about it. Are you saying you killed William Borden? And Ellis Van Camp? Alex: Yes. And what about the girl? Beatriz Leon. Not the girl. That was Mauricio. The man in the car. You're too slow to make them pay. They're too rich. Who's too rich? Alex: The lawyer, the client. Who's the client? [intense music] Alex: Did you know her? - Who? The... the... the girl. B... Beatriz. A little. Alex: Did you care? Fifteen seconds. I certainly did. I want to believe that you are a good man, Vincent. I'm the bad man. Have been for a long time. But they have to be punished. Alex: If I can't finish this... you have to. [line disconnects] He's downstairs in the park. [intense music] Woman 1: Hey, move! What is this? [both panting] He's fucking with us. He's just telling us we're way too slow. We've got an asshole exploiting a kid and how long is it taking us to bring him to trial? Two to three years, right? [panting] He said they're too rich. Now, we've been getting push back on the trafficking every step of the way. No, I think he's, he's taking out the traffickers that we couldn't. Leaving us breadcrumbs. Proving a point. [splashing] Well... Detective Marquez. How long were you watching me? Hugo: I just got here, Mrs. Borden. You shouldn't leave the gate open. Whatever will be will be. And if you're watching over me... nothing to worry about, right? You're a strong swimmer. I'm out of shape. [water splashing] I was an alternate for the '92 Olympic team. I was 17. Best time of my life. By '96, I'd lost a second. That was it. Done. So instead of a Wheaties Box and a dashing husband in LA, I ended up here. In Texas. Could you pass me that glass? Hugo: Sure. So, what do you want, Detective? Well... I'm not here to clean your pool. You are not a real cop here, are you? That's why I'm here. What? To not arrest me? Have you ever heard your husband talk about a man named David Marshall? You didn't come here to ask me questions. I didn't come here for that either. I stayed out of William's business. Wives know. I never knew the name, but I heard him on the phone. He was nervous. He didn't want me to hear. He was talking about a man from Mexico City. Why didn't you say something before? Because of who he was talking to. Davana Sealman. That's why I didn't say anything. He was being used. How? You should go. Thank you, Senora Borden. Don't ever come back, Detective Marquez. Davana Sealman? You sure? That's the name she said. Borden was probably one of her attorneys. Nope, Borden's name isn't listed on any of the filings for Sea Corp or Davana Sealman personally. You realize we're talking about one of the most powerful real estate moguls in the country, right? Vincent: Yeah. Yeah. I know, but Borden spoke to Sealman on the phone about the "Man from Mexico City." Oh, you got proof? Well, did you bang her at least? I mean, if you're gonna take the word of a half-drunk trophy wife, you may as well get something out of it, right? - Did she elaborate? - What? On the "Man from Mexico City." Shut up, hold on! Borden wasn't one of Davana Sealman's lawyers. He was one of Randy Sealman's lawyers. Davana's son. Apparently, Randy's also a real estate mogul. Oh, fuck. Randy Sealman's company owns the Central Processing facility. Where they sent Beatriz. Hey, in case you haven't noticed, they send a lot of people there. Oh, yeah, I know. But she's 13. Imagine how vulnerable you feel at that age in an ICE center. Okay, let's take a look. Okay. Well, it's not her first time there. She was there last year for three weeks with her father, and then they were deported. It gets stickier. Ellis Van Camp was CPF's builder. So everyone associated with this Processing Centre, the lawyer, the builder, Beatriz, all dead. He's going to kill Randy Sealman.

Listen, why don't you and I just... - Just have a talk? - No time for that. Vincent: I understand why you're saying that. I know you're not well. We all have to die, Vincent. What's important is what you do before you go... - Vincent! Put your gun down! - Get outta here get outta here! - Is your friend a good shot? - Very. Then it's in your hands. Hugo: Don't move!

[yelling in foreign language] [sirens wailing] [groans] [intense music] [crackling] [car engine starts] [grunts] [groans] [engine revving] [car horn honking] [yelling in foreign language] [door opening] You know, I quit drinking 15 years ago. But right now, I can actually taste the scotch in the back of my throat. Davana Sealman's only son was just murdered on my watch. She's not happy with us. The lady has even hired off-duty cops for protection. He was way ahead of us. He was probably on that boat before the party even began. Who is this fucking guy, Vince? Vincent: Alex Lewis. Well, I can tell you he's American. He's no doubt a contractor, but... I don't think these have all been hits. He wants revenge for Beatriz Leon. [bike engine revving] [engine turns off] [indistinct radio chatter] [knocks on window] [knocking] [gasps] [window whirring] Sir, you alright? [mumbles] Have you been drinking tonight, sir? [stammering] Paul... [stammering] Paul with his sons. [gunshots] [man groans] Jesus.

Must have found Alex wounded. There was blood all over the Bronco. I don't know. Maybe he got spooked. That's not his style. His style is murder, Vincent. No, we need to find him before the El Paso PD. They're not going to be happy about this. Well, we know something they don't. I think I know who Alex Lewis is. Linda: I ran juvenile records. Vandalism, auto-theft, assault. Well, it could be him. Only problem is, Alex Lewis is dead. He and his father died in the fire at the family bakery forty years ago. Investigators thought Alex set the fire. Brother's still in town though. Care facility on the parkway. Advanced Alzheimer's. Man's a vegetable. I also came up with medical records. Alex and his brother were well known at the ER. Always a "fall down the stairs" or an "accidental burn." Other things were harder to hide. Father was never charged with the abuse. Sexual or physical. Want me to warrant the bakery? Definitely. [indistinct chatter] [door creaks] [door shuts] [dramatic music] [wings fluttering] [groans] [footsteps] [clanking] [footsteps] [wings fluttering] [gun cocks] [footsteps] [wings flapping] [footsteps] [intense music] [footsteps] [gun clatters] This guy from Mexico City, the one Borden was talking to Davana Sealman about. What if she hired him? 'Cause I'm thinking if Alex is not up to killing Sealman himself, he wants us to bring her in. Catch is, the only person who can connect Sealman to any of this... Is Alex. She's harder to get to than any of the others. He reached out to you to cover his bets. The only address from Paul and Alex's medical records is the bakery. Oh, forget about it, that place is a wreck. Unless you're looking for a pigeon. What did you say? Pigeons. Palomas. The place is full of them. The lab report on the Bronco... the one where the patrolman got killed, the floor had traces of pigeon shit on it. [intense music] [tires screeching] [music continues] [clatters] [ominous music] [door opens] [footsteps] [music continues] [knock on door] [door opens] Mora: Anything I can get you? What?

[door opens] [music continues] [whirring] Mora. Mora, he's on the roof. Copy. If you get the chance, put him down. Copy that. [somber music] It's all over. Let's get you out of here. [gunfire] [glass shattering] [intense music] [Mora grunts] [body thuds] [gun cocks] [music continues] You killed my son. Yes. And I know what you've done. [gasps] [whimpers] [gun clicks] [gun clicks] [gun clicks] [thuds] [body thuds] [exhales] Firing pin. You know why I didn't just off you back there? Let me tell you why. [Alex groans] That would have been mercy. No. I want to see you go to Yuma. Where I will make sure they fuck you to death, old man. You cop-killing piece of shit. How about that little girl? You know what they do to people who hurt kids? I'll talk to FBI Agent V... V... Vincent Serra. No one else. [groans] Fuck the feds. We got you on three counts of murder. Your busted fucking gun matches Borden and Officer Eric Lyle. Guy had a wife and two kids... Danny! He needs a doctor. No, he doesn't. I've got all day, and by the end, I swear to God, I'll have me a written confession. If he went after Sealman with a broken gun, we'd have heard something. I just think he's at the end. He ain't remembering things. And also, PPD has gone totally silent. And this came from the bakery address. What is it? [envelope rustling] [dramatic music] Jesus. Where did you get this? Vincent: It doesn't matter. El Paso PD are holding Alex Lewis and I need you to transfer him into our custody. Let him be their problem. Which side of this do you really want to be on? I need to talk to him. But it seems very powerful people don't want that to happen. [tires screeching] [engines whirring] [engine rumbles] [indistinct radio chatter] [car door opens] [car door shuts] What the fuck did you do to him? - He resisted arrest. - So you had to bust him up? He's a cop killer for fuck's sake. You like being on Davana Sealman's payroll? Hey! Cool off! [intense music] [door opens] [heart monitor beeping] Well, well. The FBI. Huh. You are the one that shot me. I'm not going to offer an apology. I'm not asking for one. [pills rattle] Thank you. These aren't going to help for much longer. I understand you want to clear this up. Alex: Clear this up? No. I want Sealman dead. Well, she's not officially tied to any crime. You know that's not true. She sanctioned the hit. She hired me to kill... two people. Ellis Van Camp and the second was that child. Girl of thirteen. Be... Be... Beatriz. I won't do that. Vincent: No. No. You don't touch children. Dr. Myers: Okay, press down. Sealman: Thank you. I really appreciate you being here for me. During all this. You're not just a client, you know. Is that true, Joseph? You know, the hardest thing is never really trusting those people close to you. Besides Randy... I will never really know why someone is with me. Come on. I'm your friend, Davana. I'm here for you. The retainer for your services is $10 million. I can't. Do you realize what you're asking me to do? I'm sorry. No. - I took an oath. - An oath? Like a marriage vow? You were at Randy's parties. You think I didn't know? So, let's make this simple. $10 million or prosecution and prison for sex with minors. Davana... You need to understand something. Randy was weak. But he was my son. You are not. Vincent: Murder for hire. Murder for revenge. Child abuse. It's all here. It's not over. Everybody's dead, Alex. Even if you do make it to trial, you get life, my friend, which from what the doctors tell me is maybe three to six months. So, what are we doing here? Why are we here? Alex: Davana Sealman. Justice. Justice? - Are you kidding me? - I'll testify to all that... You're a contract killer. You think your testimony's going to stand up in court? - She hired me to kill a child. - Did you get that in writing? We're gonna need that evidence. [heart monitor beeping] You really expect we're gonna find justice? I expect you to try. Listen... Let me tell you something... about justice. Twelve months ago, a drunk driver was flying down the I-8 in a stolen car. He's high on meth. He hasn't seen another car that's pulled over on the shoulder. A mom and her ten-year-old son. Coming home from Legoland. They got a flat tire. But Colvey, he doesn't see that the woman is out there changing the tire. He just plows right into her. Kills her. Now, he stops his car and he sees behind him the boy's jumped out. He's obviously screaming. Seeing his mom, dead on the road, crying for help. But Colvey doesn't help. He puts his car in reverse and backs over the boy. Making sure there's no witnesses. Then he torches his car two miles down the road. But a 15-year-old girl, she sees him. She sees a man walking away from a big fire with a gas can. Now, it ain't much, but it's enough to put Colvey on trial. You know what happened? They do a photo line-up. But the girl, she doesn't pick Colvey. So they do an in-person, and again she doesn't pick Colvey, even though everybody knows it's him. Three times, three line-ups. Each time she picks a different guy. And Colvey walks. And he's still out there. So... memory's a motherfucker. And as for justice... [exhales] It ain't guaranteed. Your wife. Your son. [dramatic music] I have evidence. Yeah? What evidence do you got? Alex: A phone call. Davana Sealman. [stammering] Threatening... Threatening the first man I killed. Ellis Van Camp? Yes. I have that call on a... flip... - Flash? - Flash. - Flash drive? - Flash drive. Where is it? I don't know. Help, help me... Help me remember. Please. We will. We will. That makes me sick to my stomach. I'm glad that bastard is dead. His mother was covering for him. Davana Sealman? Vincent: Yeah. That woman hasn't had a parking ticket in her life. She knew that her son was raping minors. She also paid for the hit on Ellis Van Camp. Based on what evidence? The man she hired, Alex Lewis. He made it very clear to me... Oh, the testimony of a professional killer? Alex Lewis was hired by William Borden for Davana Sealman. Isn't this the same man who has some kind of dementia? Advanced Alzheimer's. Yeah, yeah. Look, I need real evidence. Alright, not just the fucking testimony of some murderer who's cognitively impaired. Jesus. Any decent lawyer would annihilate him on the stand. Listen, apparently, there's a recording of Davana Sealman on a phone call explicitly threatening Van Camp. - Well, that I can use. - I'm working on it. Well, you bring me the audio, and if it's solid, I'll make the case. Thank you, sir. [door opening] [door closing] Are you sure you're up for this? No, Gerald. I'm definitely fucking not up for this. Alex. Listen. We need to find that recording. Without that, they... they can't bring charges. Do you remember where it is? I... I've been trying to remember. Okay. I can't. [stammering] It's lost. I... I used to make notes. Here. - Mm-hm. - There's no more notes. I'm sorry. Really. I'm sorry. Listen. Without that recording, there's no case against Sealman. [stammering] And there's nothing that I or anybody can do about it. Do you understand that? [dramatic music] I need you to remember. [dramatic music] Dr. Myers. I have a writ... I know, we got a call you were coming. [music continues] [intense music] No alcohol swab? [Myers groans] [intense music] [indistinct radio chatter] Hey, hold up. Your SAC said, he doesn't go through. - He's with us. - Can't do it. He said for you to head right in. It's okay, man. Just take care. [indistinct radio chatter] [indistinct chatter] He's got a hostage. This is a fucking mess, Serra. His only demand... is to talk to you. Hey. Watch your ass. [car engine starts] [music continues] [intense music] Man on radio: They're coming out. Hold fire. That's Myers. Sniper two, do you have a shot on the subject on the right? Man on radio: Affirmative. [gunshot] Man on radio: Agent Serra, status? You killed the hostage. Stand down. Stand down! Listen to me, Agent Serra, tactical... [gunshots] They sent that man to kill me. He walked right past the cops. That bitch owns the whole game. She doesn't own the FBI. [gunshots] - Are you sure about that? - Listen to me. Maybe they'll kill you, too. Just to... Just to b... b... bury this. Yeah, maybe. Alex. Listen... Bery. That's spelled B-E-R-Y. - No. Alex. - Right? Yes. Yes. Bery. B-E-R-Y. You said justice can't be guaranteed. No. We owe it to that child, Vincent. Alex. Alex! Alex! [gunfire] [exhales] [door opening] [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] They won't let Hugo in the building. God, I bet Nussbaum deports him. Yeah. Nothing would surprise me. Where are they sending you? Crimes against Children. - You? - Unassigned. Linda: Vincent, your heart was in the right place. [dramatic music] He fucking remembered. He fucking remembered! [glass shattering] [music continues] Ellis: You've left me no choice. I won't be cut out. Look, this doesn't have to be ugly. Sealman: Blackmail is already ugly. Ellis: Look, all... Sealman: Mr. Van Camp! Sealman: We are not negotiating. You've crossed the line from which there is no return. That's it. It's not enough. What are you talking about? Well, Alex Lewis is dead. Without him, I don't have corroboration. You said, if I bring you this recording... No, no, no, no. The recording is a threat. Yes. Without the hit man, it's not enough. Come on, man, this is a case. It's not a case I can win. I'm very sorry, Vincent. You're kidding me? Look, when you're dealing with that kind of money, even if I had her handing the gun to Alex and paying him, she'd probably still win. Okay. Okay. Yeah, the sooner you realize that, the better. Listen, you tell me something. Beatriz Leon. What does she mean to you, huh? Just some lowlife Mexican kid, who's probably gonna die anyway? No, not at all. Randy Sealman would take children out of his Detention Centre and use them as his fucking sex toys. Problem is, we can't prove it. You know what's going on. We all know what's going on. Serra! You're nothing but a fucking coward. Okay, that's it, Serra! A lot of people, myself included, are fed up! Yeah. Time to take a leave, Serra. Make it a long one. And then let's re-evaluate. With pleasure. [dishes clinking] [knock on door] [knocking continues] - Yo. - Hey. We should celebrate your suspension. I'm not really up for it. I wasn't asking, dipshit. Get some fucking clothes on. [instrumental music] [crickets chirping] [pool balls clatter] Since when have you been so social? I'm trying to turn over a new leaf. I mean, you can't be an asshole forever, right? I don't know. [music continues] [gurgling] [glass shattering] [dramatic music] [gurgling] [indistinct chatter] - Hey! - No, no, no. Anymore and I'm fucking toast tomorrow. Don't be a pussy. It's not like you've got a job. I'm good. Alright. Oh, shit. I spaced my wallet. Sorry. I'll owe you. Asshole. Sol? Man on TV: ...murdered just hours ago at her home. According to an El Paso Police Department spokesmen, there are presently no suspects and no witnesses. Details are sketchy at this point. El Paso Police only... [speaking in foreign language] What's going on? [speaking in foreign language] Did you just give me an alibi? Amen. [instrumental music] [water splashes] [intense music] [music continues] [somber music] [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues]
