Wake up in the dark the aftertaste of anger in the back of my mouth Spit it on the wall and cough some more and scrape my face with razor blades and make up in the new blood and try to look so good Follow me! Make up in the new blood and follow me to where the real fun is (Ah-haw, haw) As stale and selfish as a sick dog spurning sex like an animal of god I'll tear your red hair by the roots and hold you blazing, hold you blazing in the dead electric light Your face I'll never see you this way again I captured it so perfectly as if I knew you'd disappear away Oh, shake-shake-shake-shake Shake-shake-shake-shake Shake dog shake Oh, shake-shake-shake-shake Shake-shake-shake-shake Shake dog shake You hit me again You howl and hit me again The same sharp pain Cut me in the dark and cuts me from my throat to my pounding heart, my heart, my shaking heart Shake, shake Shake, shake Shake, shake (shake-shake dog) Shake, shake dog shake But we slept all night in the virgin's bed and dreamed of death and breathed like sick dogs We slept all night in the virgin's bed and breathed like death and dreamed of sick dogs Shake, shake Oh, shake dog shake (shake, shake) Shake, shake Shake dog shake Wake up, wake up, wake up Shake dog shake Wake up, wake up, wake up Shake dog shake Wake up in the new blood Shake up in the new blood Fake up in the new blood and follow me to where the real fun is Shake dog shake Shake dog shake Shake dog, sh... Shapes in the drink like Christ Cracks in the pale blue wall I'm walking slowly and quickly but always away I'm twisting twisting to the floor Flowers in your mouth and the same dry song The routine from laughter land Sixteen white legs and a row of teeth I watch you in secrecy You're dying for the hope is gone From here we go nowhere again Oh I'm trapped in my face and I'm changing too much I can't climb out the way I fell in, oh Jump with me for that old forgotten dance The midnight sun will burn you up And your life is cold, your life is hard Your life is too much for words These occasions are such a relief Another point, another view to send Hey hey hey, we start to talk and it's, and it's all so safe Oh I feed you in my dreams Footsteps on a wire, high above my head The stain reveals my real intention I'm the waiting beast, I'm the twisted nerve As I dance, dance back to the body in my bed As I dance, dance back to the body in my bed, as I dance, dance back to the body in my bed. Look at the piggy, piggy in the mirror At the piggy, piggy in the mirror At the piggy in the mirror, oh oh oh It's not a case of doing What's right It's just the way I feel that matters Tell me I'm wrong I don't really care It's not a case of share and share alike I take what I require I don't understand... You say it's not fair You expect me to act Like a lover Consider my moves And deserve the reward To hold you in my arms And wait And wait And wait For something to happen It's not a case of telling the truth Some lines just fit the situation Call me a liar You would anyway It's not a case of aiming to please You know you're always crying It's just your part In the play for today Give me your eyes that I might see The blind man kissing my hands The head is turning, my head turns to dust As he plays on his knees As he plays on his knees And the sand and the sea grows I close my eyes Move slowly through drowning waves Going away on a strange day And I laugh as I drift in the wind Blind dancing on a beach of stone Cherish the faces as they wait for the end A sudden hush across the water And we're here again The sand and the sea grows I close my eyes Move slowly through drowning waves Going away on a strange day My head falls back and the walls crash down And the sky and the impossible explode Held for one moment I remember a song An impression of sound And then everything is gone forever A strange day A strange day The innocence of sleeping children Dressed in white and slowly dreaming Stops all time I slow my steps and start to blur So many years have filled my heart I never thought I'd say those words Further we go And older we grow The more we know The less we show Further we go And older we grow The more we know The less we show The very first time I saw your face I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune The very first time I saw your face I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon Oh, remember Oh, please don't change And so the fall came, thirteen years A shiny ring, and how I could forget your name The air no longer in my throat Another perfect lie is choked But it always feels the same So they, close together Dressed in red and yellow Innocent forever Sleeping children, in their blue soft rooms Still dream A nightmare of you Of death in the pool Wakes me up at quarter to three I'm lying on the floor of the night before With a stranger lying next to me A nightmare of you Of death in the pool I see no further now than this dream The trembling hand of the trembling man Hold my mouth to hold in a scream I try to think to make it slow If only here is where I go If this is real, I have to see I turn on fire and next to me It looks good It tastes like nothing on earth It looks good It tastes like nothing on earth Its so smooth, it even feels like skin It shows me how it feels to be new It shows me how it feels to be new A thousand voices whisper it true It shows me how it feels to be new And every voice belongs Every voice belongs to you A nightmare of you Of death in the pool Wakes me up at quarter to three I'm lying on the floor of the night before With a stranger lying next to me It looks good It tastes like nothing on earth It looks good It tastes like nothing on earth Its so smooth, it even feels like skin It shows me how it feels to be new It shows me how it feels to be new A thousand voices whisper it true It shows me how it feels to be new And every voice belongs Every voice belongs to you All the faces All the voices blur Change to one face Change to one voice Prepare yourself for bed The light seems bright And glares on white walls All the sounds of Charlotte sometimes Into the night with Charlotte sometimes Night after night she lay alone in bed Her eyes so open to the dark The streets all looked so strange They seemed so far away But Charlotte did not cry The people seemed so close Playing expressionless games The people seemed So close So many Different names Sometimes I'm dreaming Where all the other people dance Sometimes I'm dreaming Charlotte sometimes Sometimes I'm dreaming Expressionless the trance Sometimes I'm dreaming So many different names Sometimes I'm dreaming Charlotte sometimes Sometimes I'm dreaming She hopes to open shadowed eyes On a different world Come to me Scared princess Charlotte sometimes On that bleak track (See the sun is gone again) The tears were pouring down her face She was crying and crying for a girl Who died so many years before Sometimes I dream Where all the other people dance Sometimes I dream Charlotte sometimes Sometimes I'm dreaming The sounds all stay the same Sometimes I'm dreaming There are so many different names Sometimes I dream Sometimes I... Charlotte sometimes crying for herself Charlotte sometimes dreams a wall around herself But it's always with love With so much love it looks like Everything else Of Charlotte sometimes So far away Glass sealed and pretty Charlotte sometimes Yesterday I got so old I felt like I could die Yesterday I got so old It made me want to cry Go on, go on, just walk away Go on, go on, your choice is made Go on, go on, and disappear Go on, go on away from here And I know I was wrong When I said it was true That it couldn't be me and be her In between without you Without you Yesterday I got so scared I shivered like a child Yesterday away from you It froze me deep inside Come back, come back Don't walk away Come back, come back Come back today Come back, come back What can't you see? Come back, come back Come back to me And I know I was wrong When I said it was true That it couldn't be me and be her In between without you Without you Without you Without you Without you, ... Without you, ... I called you after midnight Then ran until I burst I passed the howling woman And stood outside your door We walked around the lake And woke up in the rain And everyone turned over Troubled in their dreams again Visiting time is over And so we walk away And both play dead then cry out loud Why we always cry this way? I kissed you in the water And made your dry lips sing I saw you look Like a Japanese baby In an instant I remembered everything, everything, everything, everything I called you after midnight Then ran until my heart burst I passed the howling woman And stood outside your door I kissed you in the water And made your dry lips sing I saw you look Like a Japanese baby In an instant I remembered everything, everything, everything, everything Take me for a walk Take me for a walk Let's go in the water Take me for a walk Say goodbye on a night like this If it's the last thing we ever do You never looked as lost as this Sometimes it doesn't even look like you It goes dark It goes darker still Please stay But I watch you like I'm made of stone As you walk away I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night A witch hunt for another girl For always and ever is always for you Your trust, the most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world Say hello on a day like today Say it every time you move The way that you look at me now Makes me wish I was you It goes deep It goes deeper still This touch And the smile and the shake of your head And the smile and the shake of your head I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night Can't stand here like this anymore For always and ever is always for you I want it to be perfect as before Oh, I want to change it all Oh, I want to change I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night Can't stand here like this anymore For always and ever is always for you I want it to be perfect as before Oh, I want to change it all Oh, I want to change Oh, I want to change it all Oh, I want to change Go, go, go, go, go, go Push him away No, no, no, no, no, no Don't let him stay He gets inside to stare at her The seeping mouth, the mouth that knows The secret you, always you A smile to hide the fear away Smear this man across the walls Like strawberries and cream It's the only way, it's the only way to be It's the only way to be, yeah Exactly the same clean room Exactly the same clean bed But I've stayed away too long this time And I've got too big to fit this time It doesn't matter if we all die Ambition in the back of a black car In a high building there is so much to do Going home time, a story on the radio Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh A prayer for something better A prayer for something better Please love me, meet my mother But the fear takes hold Creeping up the stairs in the dark Waiting for the death blow Waiting for the death blow Waiting for the death blow Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot Fighting for freedom on the television Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs Have we got everything? She struggles to get away The pain and creeping feeling Little black haired girl Waiting for Saturday The death of her father pushing her Pushing her white face into the mirror Aching inside me and turn me around Just like the old days, just like the old days Just like the old days Just like the old days Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face Just a piece of new meat in a clean room The soldiers close in under a yellow moon All shadows and deliverance Under a black flag A hundred years of blood Crimson, the ribbon tightens 'round my throat I open my mouth and my head bursts open A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water Thrashing in the water Over and over We die one after the other Over and over We die one after the other One after the other, one after the other One after the other, one after the other It feels like a hundred years A hundred years, a hundred years A hundred years, a hundred years Come closer and see See into the trees Find the girl While you can Come closer and see See into the dark Just follow your eyes Just follow your eyes I hear her voice Calling my name The sound is deep In the dark I hear her voice And start to run Into the trees Into the trees Into the trees Suddenly I stop But I know it's too late I'm lost in a forest All alone The girl was never there It's always the same I'm running towards nothing Again and again and again and again... I am slowing down As the years go by I am sinking I am sinking So I trick myself Like everybody else The secrets I hide Cut me inside They make me weaker So I trick myself Like everybody else So I trick myself Like everybody else I crouch in fear and wait I'll never feel again... If only I could... If only I could... If only I could remember Anything, anything... Anything at all I've waited hours for this I've made myself so sick I wish I'd stayed asleep today I never thought this day would end I never thought tonight could ever be This close to me Just try to see in the dark Just try to make it work To feel the fear before you're here I make the shapes come much too close I pull my eyes out Hold my breath And wait until I shake... But if I had your faith Then I could make it safe and clean If only I was sure That my head on the door was a dream I've waited hours for this I've made myself so sick I wish I'd stayed asleep today I never thought this day would end I never thought tonight could ever be This close to me But if I had your face I could make it safe and clean If only I was sure That my head, head, head... Let me take your hands I'm shaking like milk Turning, turning blue All over the windows and the floors Fires outside in the sky Look as perfect as cats The two of us together again It's just the same, a stupid game But I don't care if you don't And I don't feel if you don't And I won't play it if you don't And I won't say it, if you won't say it first You think you're tired now But wait until three Laughing at the Christmas lights You remember from December All of this then back again Another girl, another name Stay alive, but stay the same It's a stupid game, stupid game But I don't care if you don't And I don't feel if you don't And I won't play it if you don't And I won't play it, if you won't play it first You can't even see now So you ask me the way You wonder if it's real Because it couldn't be, couldn't be rain Through the right doorway And into the white room It used to be the dust that would lay here When I came here alone But I don't care if you don't And I don't feel if you don't And I won't play it if you don't And I won't say it, if you won't say it first Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Let's go to bed Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Let's go to bed let's go to bed This is stranger than I thought Six different ways inside my heart And everyone I'll keep tonight Six different ways go deep inside I'll tell them anything at all I know I'll give them more and more I'll tell them anything at all I know I'll give the world and more They think I'm on my hands and head This time, they're much too slow Six sides to every lie I say It's that American voice again It was never quite like this before Not one of you is the same This is stranger than I ever thought Six different ways inside my heart And everyone I'll keep tonight Six different ways go deep inside I'll tell them anything at all I know I'll give the world and more They think I'm on my hands and head This time, they're much too slow Six sides to every lie I say It's that American voice again It was never quite like this before Not one of you is the same Walk across the garden In the footsteps of my shadow See the lights out No one's home In amongst the statues Stare at nothing in The garden moves Can you help me? Close my eyes And hold so tightly Scared of what the morning brings Waiting for tomorrow Never comes Deep inside The empty feeling All the night time leaves me Three imaginary boys Slipping through the door Hear my heart beats in the hallway Echoes Round and round Inside my head Drifting up the stairs I see the steps behind me Disappearing Can you help me? Close my eyes And hold so tightly Scared of what the morning brings Waiting for tomorrow Never comes Deep inside The empty feeling All the night time leaves me Three imaginary boys sing in my Sleep sweet child The moon will change your mind See the cracked reflection Standing still Before the bedroom mirror Over my shoulder But no one's there Whispers in the silence Pressing close behind me Pressing close behind Can you help me? Can you help me? Can you help me? I would say I'm sorry If I thought that it would change your mind But I know that this time I have said too much Been too unkind I tried to laugh about it Cover it all up with lies I tried to laugh about it Hiding the tears in my eyes 'Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cry I would break down at your feet And beg forgiveness, plead with you But I know that it's too late And now there's nothing I can do So I try to laugh about it Cover it all up with lies I try to laugh about it Hiding the tears in my eyes 'Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cry I would tell you that I loved you If I thought that you would stay But I know that it's no use And you've already gone away Misjudged your limits Pushed you too far Took you for granted Thought that you needed me more, more, more Now I would do most anything To get you back by my side But I just keep on laughing Hiding the tears in my eyes 'Cause boys don't cry Boys don't cry Boys don't cry Catch me if I fall I'm losing hold I can't just carry on this way And every time I turn away I lose another blind game The idea of perfection holds me Suddenly I see you change Everything at once The same But the mountain never moves Rape me like a child Christened in blood Painted like an unknown saint There's nothing left but hope Your voice is dead And old And always empty Trust in me through closing years Perfect moments wait If only we could stay Please Say the right words Or cry like the stone white clown And stand lost forever in a happy crowd No one lifts their hands No one lifts their eyes Justified with empty words The party just gets better and better Went away alone With nothing left but faith I went away alone With nothing left but faith With nothing left but faith With nothing left but faith With nothing left but faith With nothing left but faith With nothing left but faith Nothing left... Nothing left but faith Nothing left but faith Nothing left but faith With nothing left... Get away from me Get your fingers out of my face This room's so hot This room's so hot Get away from me Leave me alone Like the pig on the stairs Hanging In a groovy purple shirt Gasping for air I'm gasping for love I'm gasping for air I'm gasping for air... Slit the cats like cheese Then eat the sweet sticky things Suck harder! Suck harder! Suck your insides Insides out! Blood thick swimming round your feet As you're choking Choking Choking on the fleshy words Give me it give me it give me it Deaden my glassy mind Give me it give me it Make me blind One step back and one step down And slip the needles in my side... My head is cold My hands are cold My heart is cold My heart is black And stops every fucking night Every night I wait until it stops... Sing birds sing birds sing birds sing Get away... Get away... Get away... Get away... 10.15 Saturday night And the tap drips Under the strip light And I'm sitting In the kitchen sink And the tap drips Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip Waiting For the telephone to ring And I'm wondering Where she's been And I'm crying For yesterday And the tap drips Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip Standing on a beach with a gun in my hand Staring at the sea Staring at the sand Staring down the barrel at the arab on the ground See his open mouth but hear no sound I'm alive I'm dead I'm the stranger killing an arab I can turn and walk away or I can fire the gun Staring at the sky Staring at the sun Whichever I choose it amounts to the same Absolutely nothing I'm alive I'm dead I'm the stranger killing an arab Feel the steel butt jump smooth in my hand Staring at the sea Staring at the sand Staring at myself Reflected in the eyes of the dead man on the beach The dead man on the beach I'm alive I'm dead I'm the stranger killing an arab.
