[WIND HOWLS] So St Moritz, are we having a good time? Give the man a round of applause, please. That was great, a round of applause. Turn. Release. Turn. Good. Making good progress. Especially the last three weeks I would say. - Right? - Yeah. We still have a long way to go for the Olympics. That's for sure. But trying to do our best [TRAIN DOORS OPEN] [LAUGHING] [HORSES HOOVES AND MEN SHOUTING] [WIND HOWLING] [FARM NOISES] [MEN SHOUTING ON PHONE] [CHILDREN TALKING] I don't know. We will see. Guess. What do you think? Er... maybe twen... thirty? Twenty seconds after two runs? Yeah. We will see. If you lose that much, I would be happy. [LAUGHING] I will keep you happy. Okay. I'm here to keep happy everybody. I'm not going to crash. Good luck boys. Thank you. Do your best. [STARTING BEEPS] [COWBELLS, CLAPPING] [STARTING BEEPS] [COWBELLS] Hey, you made it. One second faster than Alishah. Made it. Yeah, it was really bumpy. I told you. But at least you made it. - Oh yeah. - Good, was it good? - How was it? - Too slow. Who was faster? Really? One second. Amazing. Hey, but at least you came down? - Yup. - I listened very carefully, if they would. [WIND HOWLS] Tomorrow is the World Championship qualifiers in St Moritz. It's second only to the Olympic Games. Many athletes from different countries and with different skills. But I think some of them are still in our level. Yeah. I'm trying to beat someone at least. What does that mean to the people of Afghanistan to see you tomorrow maybe on television, running here in St Moritz? I already told some friends and they are waiting for us to watch, but I'm really hopeful if they broadcast on the TV. Can I have an autograph? Sure. Renzo. How do you spell your name? R... E... N... Z... O. Thanks. Thank you. Good luck. See you, huh? [NIGHTCLUB MUSIC] I wish you everything great for tomorrow. No, the day after tomorrow. Thank you. Hey, Afghanistan is great, huh? See you then. Bye, bye. Hey Andreas, good luck Afghanistan. People are writing me. - Who's he? - The secretary of the ski club. People are going crazy! [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Hello. There will be some ruts and everything. You will feel ice. Just... bah! Don't hold too long. Just quickly, quickly. Don't go too early, huh? Just when it beep... beep. Then you can go. Alright. I'm starting to get nervous. Like I would do the race. [AIRCRAFT FLIES OVER] Alishah, not to early. Not when he closes the gate. You know how the beep goes. Beep, beep, beep. And then you can go. - Okay. - Like normal. Come on! Make us proud. Oh, I'm nervous [STARTING BEEPS] Hah. Go Alishah! [MUSIC] [CHEERING] [STARTING BEEPS] Hah! Ladies and gentlemen, from Afghanistan, Mr Alishah Farhang with a time of 1 minute, 26 seconds, 81. That's 28.72 seconds behind today's leader. Mr Sajjad Hussaini from Afghanistan. A time of 1'33"91, 35.82 seconds behind today's fastest time. Yay! Fantastic job. [WAXING SKIS] [SAWING] [HAMMERING] [GIGGLING] [CHILDREN TALKING] [WIND HOWLING] Today, US forces in Afghanistan attacked an IS stronghold in Nagahar, in the east of the country, using the world's most powerful non-nuclear weapon. The US attack comes as much of the country has returned to Taliban control, and Islamic state presence is increasing. In a separate strike, according to the Pentagon, the leader of the Afghan branch of IS was killed yesterday. The aim of these US raids is to significantly disrupt Islamist terror activities in Afghanistan. [MUSIC, TRAFFIC] [DISTANT EXPLOSION] [MAN RUNNING] [SHOVELING] [DRUMMING AND SINGING] [DRUMMING AND MUSIC] [SHEEP BAAING] [MEN LAUGHING] [STARTING PISTOL] [CAR STARTS AND LEAVES] [NOISY MARKET] - Hey. - Hey. Good morning. Welcome back. Good to see you. And I heard you had a good summer. Was good summer, yeah. - Tough summer? - We had some good training. - Good training? - Yeah. Good, so you are fit? We feel fit this time. Oh, you look good. You look like ski racers. You know, in principle you should have one more year, but we don't have the time. No, no. We don't. That's the problem because the Olympics are taking place this Winter not the year after. We don't have to make too many races, but we have to see that we will arrive, if possible, at the points you need for the Olympics. Now is the time that you can write history for Afghanistan. Yeah, that's right. You can show people that with hard work you can reach a goal, and not just with cheating, right? Exactly, yeah. And this is kind of the lesson that you could deliver to a whole country. 60 million people. Yeah, yeah. So, pants off. Warm yourself up. Keep your jacket on. Just put pressure on, just quickly on your skis. Quickly, off again... [BEEP] [STARTING BEEPS AND SHOUTING] Push, push. Push, push. Good. Ok, let's get ready by putting your skis on [STARTING BEEPS AND SHOUTING] Alishah [STARTING BEEPS] [MUSIC] Go, Alishah. Come on. Three, four. Good. Forward. Woop. Come on. [CHEERING] Ah Sajjad, go! Come on. Push. Keep going. You lost about twenty-two seconds each run. Each run? Yeah. Twenty-two. More than twenty-two. Well if you would lose just about ten seconds that's okay. Even twelve, fourteen... But twenty-two is quite a lot. Twenty-two is quite a lot. You can picnic on the way down. [LAUGHING] Try and stop for a coffee somewhere. I would risk a little more because you can ski. When you ski freely you go like crazy. Just don't think too much. Just ski, yeah? Good evening, coaches. I would like to welcome you in the name of the FIS and hope that we will all enjoy a successful and accident-free event here in Folgaria. Thank you. [CHEERING IN BACKGROUND] Warm yourself up a little bit. Don't go too stiff into the turn. Release first and then on the edge. Release and then on the edge. [STARTING BEEPS] Alishah. Attack! Go for it, go for it. Come on, wake up! Come on, Sajjad. Go. [CHEERING] [STARTING BEEPS AND SHOUTING] Come on! [STARTING BEEPS] Alishah, go! Come on. Come on. Come on, fight. [MUSIC BUILDS] Come on, Sajjad. Go, go. Go, Sajjad, Go. Come on. Come on. This is going to be hell. Maybe if a helicopter take me down, I don't know, I may get on the podium. Otherwise, there is no chance. You know, that's the way it is. Maybe of these ninety people here, ten go home happy, and the other ones are going home unhappy. For this season, over. I cannot be sad or unhappy because this is the condition I am. I am happy that I tried all my best. Well, technically I'm not sure if we can get qualified, with the result we had from our last race. But perhaps there is a chance that they let us go and participate. [CAMERA CLICK] Kabul has been thrown into chaos as a suicide bomber detonated on a busy street in the Afghan capital. At least 95 people were killed, with the Taliban claiming responsibility for the attack, their second this week. Last Saturday, they stormed a major international hotel, with gunmen killing 22 people. Nine employees of Afghan airline Kam Air were killed, grounding all internal flights in the country. These attacks are another sign of an increasing Taliban presence in Afghanistan, as they once again wrestle for control from the government. [ANIMAL NOISES] [PHONE RINGS] Someone has to start, and someone has to take all this pressure on their shoulders so it becomes easier for the next one. This is difficult, but I have to open a hope for the next generation, for the young people in Afghanistan. [MUSIC] We work a lot during this past four years, and we know how to ski and we are the best of the country. You know, me and Sajjad are the best skiers from the country, because we worked hard. But it is not a good feeling not to reach your goal. I would like to train for another Olympics if it there is opportunity, but for me, the conditions are getting harder to train as an athlete [MUSIC] [CHEERS AND LAUGHING] For myself personally, it has been a great journey this. We didn't know anything about the ski racing, but now we know. We can bring it to some other people, and inspire some people, and motivate some people to do good. [LAUGHING AND CLAPPING]
