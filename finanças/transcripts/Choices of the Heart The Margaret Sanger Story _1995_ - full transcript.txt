Man: EVERY LIFE IS A JOURNEY ALONG AN UNFAMILIAR ROAD. MOTHER TAUGHT ME THAT. IN 1914, WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY NONE OF US HAD ANY IDEA THAT MOTHER'S JOURNEY WOULD TAKE HER FROM US AND PLACE HER AT THE FOREFRONT OF A MOVEMENT THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD. BUT THAT WAS STILL TO COME. FOR NOW, THE WORLD MOTHER FASHIONED FOR ALL OF US FELT AS SECURE AS HER TOUCH AS FIERY AS HER SPIRIT AS LOVING AS HER HEART. ( horn honks ) Man: IT'S A POLITICIAN'S WAR, ANITA. WILSON'S AFRAID OF CONSCRIPTION BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE SUPPORT OF THE MASSES. UNTIL HE HEARS FROM JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER. WHO DO YOU THINK HE'LL LISTEN TO? FATHER WAS AN ARCHITECT, AN ARTIST, AND A SOCIALIST-- THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SOCIALISM DIDN'T SOLVE TOO MANY PROBLEMS. BUT IT SURE MADE PEOPLE HUNGRY. IN 1914, WHEN I WAS A BOY NOTHING IN OUR LIVES COULD HAVE PREPARED US FOR MOTHER'S JOURNEY AND THE SACRIFICES THAT LAY AHEAD. ALL RIGHT, DR. BENJAMIN. I'LL GO THERE AS SOON AS I CAN. YES. GOOD-BYE. BILL? MOM, I NEED HELP WITH MY ARITHMETIC. I WISH I COULD. I'VE GOT TO GO, HONEY. BILL, I'M SORRY. APPARENTLY, IT'S AN EMERGENCY. COULD YOU HELP STUART WITH HIS HOMEWORK? AND I LEFT THE CHILDREN'S NIGHTCLOTHES ON THEIR BEDS. MISS O'LEARY'S GOT A TEMPERATURE. SHE DOES? LET'S SEE HERE. YOU'RE GETTING TOO BIG, YOU KNOW THAT? LET ME SEE. YOU'RE RIGHT, DOCTOR. WE'D BETTER GIVE HER SOME MEDICINE. ONE FOR ME AND THERE YOU GO. TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER. GRANT, DON'T FORGET TO HELP YOUR BROTHER CLEAN YOUR ROOM. I MADE THIS FOR YOU. THAT'S YOU WITH THE HAT. OH, THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. DAD, WHAT'S NINE TIMES NINE? IT'S 82. 82. ISN'T IT 81? RIGHT. DON'T FORGET PEGGY'S MEDICINE. SHE'S STILL GOT A BIT OF A COLD. OH. YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, I'M FINE. GOOD. YOU BEHAVE YOURSELVES, YES? WE'LL BE FINE. BYE, MOM. NOW WHAT DO WE DO? ( sighs ) ( dog barking, child crying ) MOTHER WORKED NIGHTS FOR THE LILLIAN WARD NURSES ASSOCIATION. SHE WENT TO PLACES LIKE HELL'S KITCHEN AND HESTER STREET. THEY SEEMED AS FAR AWAY TO US AS PARIS OR LONDON. ( dog barking, child crying ) ( horn honks ) DR. BENJAMIN SENT ME. WHAT'S WRONG? MY WIFE-- I CAME HOME, SHE WAS ON THE FLOOR. SHE WON'T EVEN LET ME TOUCH HER. PLEASE, MAKE HER BETTER. COME ON. MRS. SACHS? I'M A NURSE, I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME? SADIE. SADIE. I'M MARGARET. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED? ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU NOW. ( whimpers ) ( whispering ): DID YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF? WE COULDN'T AFFORD ANOTHER BABY RIGHT NOW. SHE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, AIN'T SHE? SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE. UH, I'LL NEED SOME ICE AND, UH, TWO KETTLES OF BOILING WATER AND ALSO, SOME CLEAN SHEETS. BUT WE AIN'T GOT NO CLEAN SHEETS. I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU GET THEM JUST GET THEM. NURSE? NURSE. MY HUSBAND JAKE, HE DON'T KNOW. PLEASE, DON'T TELL MY HUSBAND. YOU'LL BE FINE. JUST FINE. ( whimpers ) ( moans ) ( moans louder ) ( crying ) ( child crying ) NURSE. SHH. YOU NEED TO SLEEP. ANOTHER BABY WILL FINISH ME, I GUESS. IT'S TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT THAT. WHAT CAN I DO... TO STOP IT? IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY. DR. BENJAMIN WILL BE HERE IN THE MORNING. YOU CAN ASK HIM. PLEASE. HE'S A MAN. HE DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M SORRY, I... I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS. TELL ME IN SECRET. I'LL NEVER BREATHE IT TO A SOUL. WELL, IT'S A MIRACLE YOU'RE STILL ALIVE, MRS. SACHS. BUT YOU TRY ANOTHER CAPER LIKE THIS AND THERE'LL BE NO NEED TO SEND FOR ME. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HOW CAN I KEEP THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN? WELL, YOU COULD TELL YOUR HUSBAND TO, UH, SLEEP ON THE ROOF. ( dog barking ) YOU DID A VERY FINE JOB TODAY. CONGRATULATIONS. I SUPPOSE. IT SEEMS SO FUTILE SOMETIMES. ( sighs ) THESE PEOPLE-- THEY BREED LIKE RABBITS. IT'S A CULTURAL HABIT. CAN'T WE... HELP THEM PREVENT PREGNANCY INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE? ABSTINENCE IS THE ONLY THING WE'RE ALLOWED TO TELL THEM ABOUT. YOU KNOW THAT. MARGARET YOU SAVED A LIFE TODAY. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? ( sighs ) ROUGH NIGHT? YOU ALL RIGHT? ( vomiting ) I WANT TO SEE MOMMY. MOMMY'S NOT FEELING WELL, HONEY. GO BACK TO SLEEP, OKAY? I KNOW YOU MISS MOMMY. UH, STUART, GRANT WHY DON'T YOU GET BREAKFAST STARTED, OKAY? THERE'S MILK IN THE ICEBOX. GO ON, MOVE. OKAY. COME ON, PEGGY. I WANT TO SEE MOMMY. GRANT. SHE HAD THIS LOOK. IT'S DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE. AS IF THERE WAS A... A PAIN SO... DEEP INSIDE HER. AND ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS MY MOTHER. ESPECIALLY THE LAST FEW MONTHS BEFORE SHE DIED. AND HOW SHE WOULD LOOK AT ME HER EYES ALL RED AND... SWOLLEN. AS IF THEY WERE BEGGING ME TO TAKE AWAY HER PAIN. I WAS YOUNG. I FELT I BETRAYED HER. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE. NO, MICHAEL, I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF MY ASSISTANTS. BUT, BELIEVE ME, MY HEARTFELT THANKS AGAIN, OKAY? OKAY, BYE-BYE. THE GENTLEMEN... YEAH, I CAN SEE. SEND THEM IN. MR. COMSTOCK. GOOD AFTERNOON. WELL, WE HAVE A... I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S A MOTLEY GROUP OR A GOODLY GROUP. WHAT NOW, GENTLEMEN? ARE THE PORNOGRAPHERS UP IN ARMS AGAIN? IS IT TRUE, SIR YOUR SOCIETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF VICE HAS ORDERED A PAINTING OF A NAKED WOMAN REMOVED FROM THE WINDOW OF THE BRAUN GALLERY? SEPTEMBER MORN, RIGHT. YEAH, I HAD IT REMOVED BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS UH... INDECENT. YOU'RE AWARE IT WON A MEDAL AT THE PARIS SPRING SALON? I DON'T KNOW, FRIEND. I TOOK ONE LOOK THOUGHT IT WON A MEDAL FROM A PARISIAN SALOON. YOU DO REALIZE THAT THE BRAUN GALLERY SAYS THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT YOU OVER THIS? WELL, I'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE FIGHT ME OVER THE YEARS LISTEN, YOU JUST ASK THE CONGRESSMEN. LET ME TELL YOU I HAD QUITE A FIGHT WITH CONGRESS OVER THE ANTI-PORNOGRAPHY LAWS NOW IN THE POSTAL SYSTEM, WHICH I'M VERY PROUD OF. WE ALL KNOW HOW THAT FIGHT TURNED OUT. CAN WE GET A QUOTE MR. COMSTOCK, PLEASE? OKAY. I AM, UH... A SERVANT OF GOD AND I WILL, UH, FIGHT TO PROTECT THE MORALS OF THIS COUNTRY UNTIL THEY, UH BURY ME. GREAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR. HAVE A GOOD DAY. LOOKING FOR SOMETHING? LACROIX, SCHWARTZ, BRADDOCK, PANTLIANO STEINBERG, O'CONNOR, VANZETTI, WILGIN LAMB, LIEBNICK AND O'HARA-- EVERY ONE OF THESE WOMEN DIED OF A SELF-INDUCED ABORTION AT THIS HOSPITAL IN THIS WEEK ALONE. YES, I KNOW. IT'S VERY SAD. IT'S SAD? DON'T YOU THINK WE'RE OBLIGATED TO DO SOMETHING? LIKE WHAT? HELP THEM. GIVE THEM SOME INFORMATION SO THEY DON'T GET PREGNANT AND DIE THIS WAY. EVEN DISCUSSING THIS IN PUBLIC COULD SEND US TO PRISON. IT'S AGAINST THE COMSTOCK LAWS YOU KNOW THAT. WELL, THESE LAWS ARE KILLING WOMEN. YOU'RE A NURSE, I'M A DOCTOR. OUR JOB IS TO CURE PEOPLE. WE DON'T MAKE LAWS. GRANT? STUART? HELLO. Bill: HELLO. WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN? WITH YOUR CAPABLE SISTER NAN BECAUSE WE'RE INVITED TO MABLE DODGE'S, REMEMBER? OH, BILL, PLEASE. I CAN'T TODAY. I'M NOT UP TO IT. NEITHER AM I, BUT SHE'S EXPECTING US. MABLE DODGE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ME. BESIDES, HOW CAN A WOMAN THAT WEALTHY CALL HERSELF A SOCIALIST? BECAUSE SHE'S GOOD FOR THE MOVEMENT AND HAS INFLUENCE. YOU MEAN MONEY. NO, I MEAN RESOURCES. MM-HMM. AND HER HEART'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE. BESIDES, EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE THERE. JACK REED'S GOING TO BE THERE, ANITA... THE PARKERS AND THE GOLDMANS ARE SUPPOSED TO PUT IN AN APPEARANCE. OH, IF EMMA'S GOING TO BE THERE... WE ALL KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT EMMA. SO I THINK WE SHOULD BE THERE, TOO. SO GET DRESSED, PLEASE. Goldman: THE SYSTEM ENCOURAGES POVERTY BY REWARDING THOSE WOMEN WHO PROCREATE WHO GIVE THE STATE LARGE FAMILIES AND BY PUNISHING THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK SELF-FULFILLMENT IN ITS PLACE. THE DAY IS COMING WHEN THE WOMEN OF AMERICA WILL NOT ACCEPT THE ROLE... HEY, KIDDO. HI, MABLE. YOU REMEMBER MY WIFE, MARGARET. YES, OF COURSE. HELLO. ...AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE BEGINNING TO SEE THE LIGHT. LOOK WHO WE LANDED. BIG FISH. Goldman: ...TO THE POLITICIAN IS THAT SCHLESINGER? MM-HMM. RUMOR HAS IT HE'S TO TAKE OVER FROM EUGENE DEBS AS PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY. HE HAS THE RIGHT HAIRCUT, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. ( hearty applause ) DO YOU WANT A DRINK? OKAY. YEAH. Schlesinger: MY FRIENDS... THE PAST TWO ELECTIONS, THE SOCIALIST PARTY RAN ON A PLATFORM OF WORKERS' RIGHTS. TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR FRIENDS, OUR SISTERS THE MOTHERS OF OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE DENIED A SAY IN GOVERNING THIS COUNTRY. UNTIL WOMEN HAVE THE VOTE UNTIL WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO AUTONOMY THEN WE ARE A POORER COUNTRY FOR IT. WHAT... ( Margaret clears throat ) WHAT ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE MATERNITY? WHAT GOOD IS THE VOTE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE BASIC RIGHT TO CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR BODIES? NONE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT IS EXACTLY THESE ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. THE WOMEN OF THIS MOVEMENT... THE WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY WILL NOT BE DENIED! AND THE SOCIALIST PARTY WILL BE THERE TO SUPPORT YOU. ( romantic music playing ) ( soft sigh ) MMM. ( phone rings ) ( rings again ) I WONDER WHO THAT COULD BE. DO YOU WANT ME TO GET IT? I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMEONE CALLING FOR AN ARCHITECT THIS TIME OF NIGHT. ( phone continues ringing ) HELLO. WHEN? ( thunder rumbling in distance ) YES, I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN. ( door closes ) ( child babbling, whining ) ( child coughing ) ( child continues whining ) ( thunder rumbling in distance ) OKAY, TAKE THEM OUTSIDE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. COME ON, CHILDREN. ( footsteps on stairs ) ( child sniffling ) MR. SACHS. I ONLY FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T HIDE IT NO MORE. SEE, I TOLD HER &quot;SADIE... &quot;WE'LL FIND A WAY. WE'LL MAKE ENDS MEET.&quot; ( sobs ) ( crying ) ( thunder ) ( rain falling ) Grant: THE DEATH OF SADIE SACHS HAUNTED MOTHER. WE WERE STILL A FAMILY BUT SOMETHING HAD CHANGED IN HER. IT WAS AS IF AN INNOCENCE WAS ENDING. HEY, MA. REAL LIVE MUSSELS AND CLAMS. WANT TO BUY SOME? HOW MUCH ARE THEY, SIR? A PENNY A POUND. IT'S A DEAL. Peggy: MAMA, MAMA, LOOK AT ME! OOH, YES, PEG! BRAVA, BRAVA. MOM, CAN WE GO HOME NOW? YES, YES, PEGGY, IN A MINUTE. EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING FOR A BOOK THAT CONTAINS CERTAIN MEDICAL INFORMATION. WELL, THIS IS THE FINEST MEDICAL COLLECTION IN THE COUNTRY. WHAT IS IT SPECIFICALLY? ANYTHING THAT PERTAINS TO MATERNITY AND ITS PREVENTION. EXCUSE ME? FEMALE CONTRACEPTION. I'M AFRAID WE DON'T CARRY THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. HOW COME? SHH, PEGGY, SHH. REALLY, BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN TO EVERY PLACE IN THIS CITY. ANTHONY COMSTOCK HIMSELF POLICES THESE SHELVES. ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T MEET WITH HIS APPROVAL IS TAKEN AWAY AND BURNED. ANTHONY COMSTOCK. I'M SORRY BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE. MOM, CAN WE GO HOME NOW? I'M HUNGRY. WELL, YES, I'M HUNGRY, TOO. THANK YOU. BYE, MISS LIBERRIAN. ( clock chiming ) Grant: MORE MILK? Stuart: NO, THANK YOU. FATHER, ARE WE SOCISITS? SOCIALISTS. THAT'S WHAT I SAID, SOCISTIS. DUMMY. AM NOT. ARE, TOO. MAMA, CAN I BE A SOCIALIST JUST LIKE YOU? CAN I, CAN I, CAN I? SOCIALIST, DUMMY. AM NOT. OKAY, SO-CIAL-IST: S-H-O... I-A-L-I-S-T. SO-CIAL-IST. SO-CIAL-IST. FINALLY. SO, ARE WE, FATHER? ARE WE SOCIALISTS? WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR MOTHER? MARGARET? YES. GRANT HAS A QUESTION FOR YOU. ♪ IF THAT CART AND BULL TURN OVER ♪ ♪ MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A DOG NAMED ROVER ♪ ♪ AND IF THAT DOG NAMED ROVER DON'T BARK ♪ ( both bark ) ( both laugh ) ♪ MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A HORSE AND CART ♪ ♪ AND IF THAT HORSE AND CART FALL DOWN ♪ ♪ YOU'RE STILL THE SWEETEST LITTLE GIRL IN TOWN. ♪ ( laughing ) MISS O'LEARY'S SAD. SHE IS? WHAT'S SHE SAD ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW. SHE WON'T TELL ME WHAT SHE'S SAD ABOUT. WELL, MAYBE SHE'LL WHISPER IT TO YOU. SHE THINKS HER MOMMY'S GOING TO GO AWAY. BUT WHY? MOMMY'S RIGHT HERE. MOMMY'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. APPARENTLY, COMSTOCK HAD A PAINTING REMOVED FROM THE MET BECAUSE IT WAS OF A WOMAN... A NUDE? AND SHE WAS RECLINING. APPARENTLY RECLINING IS ILLEGAL. HE OUGHT TO BE CHALLENGED. HE OUGHT TO BE DRAWN AND QUARTERED. WHY ISN'T HE? WHAT? DRAWN AND QUARTERED? CHALLENGED? IT'S A PRISON SENTENCE, MARGARET. HE MAKES THE LAW. DID YOU KNOW THAT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK THERE'S NOT ONE SINGLE TEXTBOOK ON REPRODUCTION OR PREVENTING PREGNANCY? BUT IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE THE INFORMATION IS COMMONPLACE. CONTRACEPTION IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT? RESEARCH. YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT WRITING ABOUT THIS FOR THE PAPER? NO. YOU SHOULD. ( din of conversation outside ) MR. COMSTOCK? ED CADY. ( phone rings ) ( noise ceases ) I FINALLY GET TO MEET THE LIVING LEGEND. YEAH, WELL, MAKE IT BRIEF, WILL YOU? I'VE GOT, UH... A ROOMFUL OF REPORTERS OUT THERE WAITING FOR ME. OF COURSE, THIS WON'T TAKE A MOMENT. AS YOU KNOW, THE MEN I WORK FOR THE INTERSTATE LOTTERY WELL, WE'VE TAKEN A GREAT INTEREST IN THE SOCIETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF VICE. AND? WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ALLOWED THE PRIVILEGE OF OFFERING A DONATION. SAY, $25,000 A YEAR, EVERY YEAR, FOR LIFE. FOR LIFE? WELL, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THE LOTTERY WANTS TO SHOW ITS APPRECIATION. AS A MATTER OF FACT I COULD HAVE THE FIRST CHECK IN, SAY, 48 HOURS. FOR CONVENIENCE, WE COULD MAKE THE CHECK OUT TO YOU PERSONALLY. PERSONALLY? PERSONALLY. I SEE. WELL, JUST TELL ME, UH... WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO FOR THE ORGANIZATION? WELL, PERHAPS A SHOW OF MUTUAL GOOD WILL. YOU'RE AWARE, OF COURSE, I CAN'T BE BRIBED? WE DON'T HAVE TO CALL IT THAT. WHAT WOULD WE CALL IT? WELL, I WOULD CALL IT A GESTURE OF APPRECIATION. A GESTURE OF APPRECIATION. I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT, IT'S GOT A... A RING TO IT. ( laughs ) A GESTURE OF APPRECIATION. THAT'S QUAINT... COULD I SEE YOU HERE FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE? CERTAINLY. NOT ONLY... WILL YOU NOT HAVE AN OFFICE IN NEW YORK CITY BUT YOU WILL NOT HAVE AN OFFICE ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES. NOW, GET OUT. ( shouts ): OUT! LICE! GENTLEMEN. MR. COMSTOCK WILL NOW TAKE QUESTIONS. YES, MR. COMSTOCK IS TRUE THAT THE POSTMASTER GENERAL IS NOT GOING TO RENEW YOUR COMMISSION? YES, SIR. I HAVE A LETTER HERE. TO MR. COMSTOCK, FROM THE POSTMASTER GENERAL. AND I QUOTE &quot;THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A FEW CASES &quot;IN WHICH YOUR METHODS WERE OPEN TO CRITICISM &quot;BUT YOU HAVE HAD AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE HEARTY SUPPORT OF THIS DEPARTMENT.&quot; SIR, ARE YOU SAYING YOU WILL NOT RESIGN? HEH, I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE WAY I FEEL RIGHT NOW I GUESS... OH, I COULD GO ON FOR MAYBE... FOUR CENTURIES. ( laughter ) MR. COMSTOCK, IS IT TRUE YOU VISITED THE MIDWAY AT THE WORLD'S FAIR TO LOOK AT THE HOOTCHY-KOOTCHY DANCERS? ( scattered uneasy chuckles ) YEAH, THAT, UH... THAT'S TRUE, I DID. AND I FOUND THEM, UH... INDECENT AND IMMORAL. DO YOU CARE TO SHOW US HOW, SIR? I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN THERE MANY MORE TIMES THAN I HAVE. WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US THE DANCE? ( laughter ) THAT'S IT THAT'LL BE ALL, GENTLEMEN. MR. COMSTOCK? ( chattering stops ) I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET. UM... MARGARET SANGER. WHAT COULD I DO FOR YOU? WHY DO YOU DENY THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT MATERNITY? I THINK THAT'S A RATHER OBJECTIONABLE QUESTION. WILL YOU ANSWER IT? YES, I'LL ANSWER IT. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD THAT'S CONCEIVED IS A GIFT OF GOD, AND IS A PART OF OUR FUTURE. I ONLY KNOW ONE CHILD THAT WAS CONCEIVED BY GOD. I BEG YOUR PARDON? WHY SHOULDN'T WOMEN BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE WHEN THEY WANT TO BE PREGNANT? YOU MEAN THEY SHOULD DECIDE? YES. ( scoffs ) OH, MY. LISTEN, GENTLEMEN, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE VERY CONFUSED YOUNG LADY WHO HAS FORGOTTEN GOD. PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION. I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE GOD AND GOD ALONE DECIDES WHEN A WOMAN SHOULD HAVE A CHILD. WOMEN ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY LACK INFORMATION. BECAUSE YOUR LAWS MR. COMSTOCK, DENY THEM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY NEED TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES. I THINK YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH. ANSWER MY QUESTION. I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, YOUNG LADY! I'LL ANSWER IT, BECAUSE GOD ALONE DECIDES WHEN A WOMAN HAS A CHILD AND MAY GOD FORGIVE YOU! MAY GOD FORGIVE YOU, YOU POOR, MISINFORMED CREATURE! MAY GOD FORGIVE YOU! GOOD AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN. JACK WILEY, AMERICAN SPECTATOR. WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS? ( door slams ) MARGARET... HIGGINS... SANGER. MRS. SANGER, MIND IF WE ASK A FEW QUESTIONS? NOT IF YOU DON'T MIND PRINTING THE ANSWERS. ( scattered chuckles ) Grant: THE NEWSPAPER PRINTED MOTHER'S ANSWERS, ALL RIGHT. AND ALL OF NEW YORK HEARD ABOUT THEM. ( door closes ) Margaret: HELLO? HELLO. BILL? WHERE IS EVERYONE? NAN TOOK STUART AND PEGGY TO THE PARK AND GRANT'S IN HIS ROOM. OH. HOW WAS YOUR DAY? WELL, IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. I WAS THE TALK OF THE OFFICE. YOU? WELL, I SPENT SOME TIME WITH ANITA AND SHE WANTS ME TO THINK ABOUT WRITING A COLUMN FOR THE CALL. NO DOUBT. YOU'VE SEEN IT. ( whispers ): QUITE. ( clock ticking quietly ) AND? AND I, UH... I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE PART WHERE HE SAYS &quot;ANTHONY COMSTOCK RECEIVED A SPIRITED CHALLENGE FROM A MARGARET HIGGINS SANGER.&quot; WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? OH, I WAS GOING TO. I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU TODAY AND THEN I GOT CAUGHT UP, SO... I'M SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE. GOOD GOD, MARGARET, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR SENSES? WHY? HE COULD SEND YOU TO PRISON. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANTHONY COMSTOCK. HE MAKES THE LAWS. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE CHILDREN? DON'T YOU DARE PUT THAT ON ME. I AM DOING THIS FOR MY CHILDREN. YOU'RE ACTUALLY THINKING YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE? BILL SANGER, YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE. IT'S ALL JUST TALK, ISN'T IT? ALL OF THIS... PARLOR SOCIALISM. YOUR FRIENDS WITH THEIR HAIRCUTS AND THEIR FINE CLOTHES. IT'S ALL TALK, IT'S NOTHING BUT TALK, IS IT? I WON'T BE INSULTED IN THIS WAY IN MY HOUSE BY MY OWN WIFE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, BILL. I DO UNDERSTAND. ( talking quietly ) HELLO, ELAINE. HELLO. MY NAME IS MARGARET HIGGINS SANGER. AND THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT WHAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW. I AM A NURSE AND I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF WOMEN WHO ARE DESPERATE FOR INFORMATION. AND I KNOW AND I'VE SEEN THAT, UM, IGNORANCE CAN KILL. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR ANY OF US TO GET PREGNANT YEAR AFTER YEAR UNLESS WE CHOOSE TO. SO, I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY DISCUSSING THE VARIOUS METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION USED DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. ( murmuring ) WELL, I NEVER! WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO GO? BECAUSE YOU'RE FREE TO. ( sighs in relief ) ALL RIGHT. ONE OUT OF SEVEN'S NOT BAD. THE SEVENTH POINT: EVERY YOUNG COUPLE SHOULD PRACTICE BIRTH CONTROL DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF MARRIAGE BECAUSE THIS IS THE TIME OF PHYSICAL, SPIRITUAL AND FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENT DURING WHICH THEY GROW TOGETHER CEMENT THE BONDS OF ATTRACTION, AND PLAN FOR THEIR CHILDREN. MOTHERHOOD, LIKE ANY PROFESSION SHOULD SERVE ITS APPRENTICESHIP. VOLUNTARY MOTHERHOOD, VOLUNTARY PARENTHOOD NEW MOTHERHOOD CONSTRUCTIVE GENERATION, FAMILY LIMITATION ALL OF THESE PHRASES ADD UP TO ONE: BIRTH CONTROL. AND THAT IS YOUR RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT ANTHONY COMSTOCK SAYS. YES! ( hearty applause ) THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. THE MEETING OF THE NEW YORK SOCIETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF VICE WILL COME TO ORDER AND I BELIEVE THAT MR. SCOPES HAS SOMETHING TO READ. A MATTER HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION WHICH I BELIEVE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION. THIS RADICAL NEWSPAPER HAS PRINTED AN ARTICLE BY ONE MARGARET SANGER AN ARTICLE SO TRULY APPALLING I HESITATE TO READ FROM IT. READ IT. YES, SIR. IT IS ENTITLED, &quot;WHAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW.&quot; UM, I'LL SKIP THE INTRODUCTION AND GO TO THE VILEST PART. I QUOTE, &quot;ONE OF THE MOST BASIC TECHNIQUES TO PREVENT CONCEPTION &quot;INVOLVES THE HUSBAND WITHDRAWING HIS PENIS... ( murmuring ) ...FROM HIS WIFE'S VAGINA JUST PRIOR TO EJACULATION.&quot; THAT'S ENOUGH. ( murmuring ) THIS IS JUST THE FIRST IN A SERIES, IT SAYS. IT MAY BE THE FIRST BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IT'S GOING TO BE THE LAST. ( loud approval ) ( whistle blows ) BY ORDER OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT THESE NEWSPAPERS ARE TO BE CONFISCATED FORTHWITH. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? ARNOLD SCOPES, ACTING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF ANTHONY COMSTOCK. THIS PUBLICATION VIOLATES THE LAWS OF DECENCY. HOW DARE YOU. GENTLEMEN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PUT THOSE DOWN! Man: HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THIS. I'M AFRAID YOU'RE WRONG, MRS. BLOCK. LAW GIVES US EVERY RIGHT. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE EVERYTHING. THIS TIME, THE PAPERS. NEXT TIME, WE'LL SHUT YOU DOWN PERMANENTLY. GOOD DAY. Man: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? ( sighs ) I'M SORRY. ( knocking on door ) HELLO. IS THIS THE SANGER RESIDENCE? YES, IT IS. MR... SCHLESINGER. I WAS GIVEN YOUR ADDRESS BY MABLE DODGE. SHE'S A VERY GOOD FRIEND. YES. I'M SORRY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN? TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, MR. SANGER I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR WIFE'S COLUMN IN THE CALL. I WAS HOPING TO MEET HER. UH, YEAH, WELL, CERTAINLY. UM... MARGARET? WE HAVE A VISITOR. IT'S A TRUE PLEASURE, MRS. SANGER. ( clock chimes the half hour ) I HEARD ABOUT THE... RAID ON THE CALL. SHAMEFUL. ANOTHER? THANK YOU. WELL, ANITA IS PLANNING A SUBTLE PROTEST IN THE NEXT EDITION. PERFECT. THE IMPORTANT THING IS... I CAN STILL REACH PEOPLE, RIGHT? THE PARTY'S LOOKING FOR BRIGHT WOMEN. FORWARD THINKERS. NEW FACES. OUR PLATFORM WITH REGARD TO WOMEN'S RIGHTS WELL, TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, THERE ISN'T ONE. ( chuckles weakly ) WE RECOGNIZE WE'RE VERY WEAK IN THIS AREA. ( laughing ) OH, NO, I'M, I'M REALLY NOT THAT INTERESTED IN POLITICS MR. SCHLESINGER. HOWEVER, WE CAN ALWAYS USE AN ALLY. RIGHT... BILL? RIGHT. THE FIRST RIGHT OF EVERY CHILD IS TO BE WANTED. HERE, HERE. ( murmuring assent ) THE FIRST RIGHT OF EVERY WOMAN IS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN CONTRACEPTION. YES. YES. YES. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BIRTH CONTROL. ( cheering ) ( whistle blowing ) ( excited crowd reaction ) ( loud protests ) ( whistles blow shrilly ) Comstock: LISTEN, LISTEN. LADIES, LISTEN TO WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. WAIT A MINUTE, LISTEN TO ME. THIS WOMAN, THIS... WAIT A MINUTE, LISTEN. THE WOMAN IS YOUR ENEMY. THAT WOMAN THERE. YOU DON'T BELONG HERE, LADY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? GO HOME AND PRAY TO GOD ALMIGHTY TO FORGIVE YOU TO FORGIVE ME FOR OUR SINS. GO HOME AND PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS. PLEASE, I BEG YOU, PRAY, PRAY, PRAY. COMSTOCK DIDN'T HAVE A CASE AGAINST ME AND HE KNEW IT. DON'T BE NAIVE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE POPULATION PROBLEM OF THE UNITED STATES BY RUNNING AROUND GIVING SEX LECTURES! MAYBE NOT, BUT I'M DAMN WELL GOING TO TRY. LISTEN TO ME. THESE WOMEN ARE STARVED FOR INFORMATION AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE IGNORED COMSTOCK OR NO COMSTOCK. I WILL BE GUILTY IF I TURN AWAY. DAMN YOU. YOU ARE SO STUBBORN. ( sighs ) ARE YOU WILLING TO GO TO PRISON FOR THEM? IF I HAVE TO. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. YOU KNOW, UH... HEH. I'VE WORKED WITH A LOT OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN MY DAY. NOT ONE OF THEM EVER KEPT ME WAITING LIKE YOU DID. I APOLOGIZE, MR. COMSTOCK, BUT WE'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY SWAMPED. NOW, LET'S SEE. YOU'RE HERE CONCERNING THAT NEW PLAY FROM FRANCE, HELENE? NO, I'M NOT, I'M HERE CONCERNING MARGARET SANGER. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WOMAN IS FREE TO BE OBSCENE IN PUBLIC. I DIDN'T SEE ANY BASIS FOR CHARGING HER. GIVING A LECTURE ISN'T AGAINST THE LAW. BEING OBSCENE IN PUBLIC IS MR. DISTRICT ATTORNEY. I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS BUT I FAIL TO SEE WHY YOU'VE MADE AN ISSUE OUT OF THIS PARTICULAR WOMAN. WHY? BECAUSE I HAVE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO FIGHTING SIN AND I THINK MARGARET SANGER IS A SINNER. LOOK, LET ME TELL YOU A STORY, ALL RIGHT? WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MR. COMSTOCK I HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR STORIES. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR I'M A LITTLE OLDER THAN YOU ARE AND I'M NOT A FOOL. I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT YOU WERE. PLEASE, TELL ME YOUR STORY. WELL, WHEN I WAS, UH... A CHILD I LIVED IN A SMALL TOWN. AND ONE DAY THE WORD GOT OUT THAT THE SALOON KEEPER'S DOG HAD BROKEN LOOSE AND WAS ATTACKING CHILDREN. NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS LIKE SOME SPIRIT OR SOMETHING IT JUST TOOK, TOOK ME OVER AND I GRABBED MY FATHER'S GUN AND I PRAYED TO GOD ALMIGHTY &quot;PLEASE GIVE ME COURAGE.&quot; AND THEN I WENT OUT AND I BEGAN TO SEARCH AND I SEARCHED FOR THAT DOG AND SEARCHED FOR THAT DOG. I COULDN'T FIND THAT DOG ANYWHERE. AND SUDDENLY THERE CAME A VOICE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE VOICE OF GOD BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT SAID TO ME, &quot;WATCH OUT, TURN.&quot; AND SURE ENOUGH IT WAS THE DOG. FOAMING AT THE MOUTH CRAZED EYES LIKE SOMETHING FROM HELL. WELL, I RAISED MY GUN I PULLED THE TRIGGER. AND NOTHING HAPPENED. NOTHING. AND THEN THE DOG-- IT LEAPED TOWARDS ME WITH ITS JAWS OPEN AS IF IT WAS GOING TO TEAR ME TO SHREDS, AND SUDDENLY THE GUN WENT OFF AND THAT DOG WAS DEAD BEFORE IT HIT THE GROUND. AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I WAS CHOSEN BY GOD. I WAS CHOSEN TO FIGHT SIN WITH EVERY BREATH IN MY BODY. AND MARGARET SANGER, IN MY OPINION IS A SINNER. I'D LIKE TO, UH... THANK YOU FOR YOUR BRIEF ATTENTION. ( steam whistle blowing ) MARGARET HIGGINS! COME OVER HERE, MY BABY BEAR. GIVE YOUR POP A BIG IRISH HUG. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU HATE NEW YORK. NAN TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING TO BILL'S OFFICE SO I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE YOU. DADDY, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE CITY IN YEARS. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH, DARLIN'. I WANT YOU TO COME BACK UPSTATE WITH ME. A FEW PEACEFUL WEEKS TOGETHER THERE UP AT THE LAKE. NAN'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU-- ON SOME SORT OF CRUSADE ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL OR SOME SUCH NONSENSE. IT'S NOT NONSENSE. WELL, I KNOW YOUR MOTHER WOULDN'T APPROVE OF IT. IF MOTHER HAD KNOWN ABOUT IT, SHE MIGHT BE ALIVE TODAY. DON'T GET STARTED ON YOUR HIGH HORSE ABOUT THAT. IT'S 15 YEARS SINCE THE T.B. TOOK HER. DADDY, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP KIDDING YOURSELF? IT WASN'T T.B., SHE WAS JUST WORN OUT. I MEAN, 11 CHILDREN AND 18 PREGNANCIES. NOW, YOUR MOTHER HAD A FRAIL CONSTITUTION BUT SHE LOVED ALL OF YOU. WHILE SHE WAS ALIVE. DARLING, BILL AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GRAND IDEA FOR YOU TO SPEND A WEE BIT OF TIME UP IN THE MOUNTAINS. YOU AND BILL TALKED ABOUT THIS? WELL, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT YOU. WE BOTH ARE. WHY IS IT THAT YOU AND BILL THE TWO MOST PROGRESSIVE MEN I KNOW HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME WITH A WOMAN WHO SPEAKS HER MIND? IT'S FUNNY. ENJOY THE MOUNTAINS. MARGARET! MR. KRULIC? IF YOU WANT MONEY, HE'S NOT HERE. EMMA GOLDMAN GAVE US YOUR NAME. I TOLD HER, I DON'T NEED NO TROUBLE. THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT MAKES A THREAT OF ME. TOO DANGEROUS. WE JUST NEED A PAMPHLET PRINTED. EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL. IT'S FOR WOMEN. IT'S... UH, THEIR HEALTH, PREVENTING DISEASE AND CONTROLLING PREGNANCY. CONTROL PREGNANCIES? WHAT'S THIS? BIRTH CONTROL. IT EXPLAINS THE WAYS WOMEN CAN PLAN PARENTHOOD. I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU. BASICALLY, MR. KRULIC, IT'S ABOUT SEX. IT'S ABOUT SEX? AND ABOUT FREEDOM. WOMEN BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDREN SO THAT THERE'S NOT SO MANY MOUTHS TO FEED. WOULD I BE BREAKING THE LAW IF I PRINT THIS PAMPHLET? HONESTLY... YES. I CAN'T HELP YOU. WE'VE BEEN TO EVERY PRINTER IN THE CITY. I HAVE A FAMILY. I'M SORRY. PERHAPS IF YOU AND YOUR WIFE READ IT. I HAVE MY ADDRESS DOWN ON THE BOTTOM. PLEASE. NO, I, I... THANK YOU. BUT... MRS. SANGER? MR. KRULIC? YOU TOLD ME TO SEE YOU IF I CHANGE MY MIND. YOU'LL PRINT MY PAMPHLETS? I DIDN'T HAVE NO CHOICE. MY WIFE TOLD ME THAT IF I DIDN'T SHE WOULD SHOW ME THE TRUE MEANING OF ABSTINENCE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH. COME TO MY SHOP TOMORROW. HERE. TAKE THEM HOME TO YOUR WIFE. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. THANK YOU. MA'AM, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CHILD. BUT IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU DON'T WANT... Woman: CAN I GET ONE? GIVE THAT TO YOUR FRIEND. MY NAME IS ANTHONY COMSTOCK. I WANT EVERYTHING OPENED UP IN HERE, PLEASE, FOR INVESTIGATION. THIS IS U.S. MAIL. I AM A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SYSTEM AND I CAN BLOODY WELL DO ANYTHING I WANT. AND I SUGGEST YOU GO BACK AND GET TO WORK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING. ALL THE SAME HANDWRITING, NO RETURN ADDRESS. HOLD THAT. SO NOW, WHAT HAVE WE HERE? ( laughing ) OH, JOY. &quot;WHAT EVERY MOTHER SHOULD KNOW&quot; BY MARGARET HIGGINS SANGER. WELL, SCOPES I THINK FINALLY MRS. SANGER HAS BROKEN THE LAW. TAKE THEM BACK TO THE OFFICE. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK ANYMORE. WE'VE FOUND WHAT WE WANTED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TAKE HIM. SIR, WHAT...? PLEASE. NO, NO! I SAID TAKE HIM, I DIDN'T SAY HIT HIM. GO ON, GO ON, GO ON, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. Police officers: COME ON, COME ON. THIS IS BLASPHEMOUS. ABSOLUTELY BLASPHEMOUS AND STUPID. GOD FORGIVE HIM. ( knocking on door ) HELLO, BILL. HELLO. IS MARGARET HERE? IT'S VERY LATE, IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? SHE'S IN SERIOUS TROUBLE, BILL. OH, GOD, COME IN, COME IN. COMSTOCK FOUND COPIES AT THE POST OFFICE. TRACED THEM BACK TO THE PRINT SHOP. LEO? HE'S BEEN ARRESTED. GOD. HE WANTS TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF YOU. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. WE CAN FIGHT HIM IN COURT, RIGHT? YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT COMSTOCK. AT BEST HE'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER, A DEAL. MEANING WHAT? REDUCED SENTENCE IN EXCHANGE FOR A PUBLIC APOLOGY. AN ADMISSION YOU WERE SELLING SMUT. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NO... I CAN'T, IT, IT, IT WOULD BE A BETRAYAL. AND, AND, AND IT'S A LIE. A CONVICTION COULD MEAN A FIVE-YEAR SENTENCE. WHAT DO I DO? YOU CAN GO AWAY. WE HAVE CONTACTS IN ENGLAND, THEY CAN HELP. WE CAN GET YOU OUT OF THE COUNTRY BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY. YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT THERE UNTIL THIS DIES DOWN. IT'S THE ONLY WAY, MARGARET. BILL? MAMA? YES, BABY? I'M COLD. OH, HERE WE GO. GO BACK TO SLEEP, OKAY? OKAY. OKAY. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. SWEET DREAMS. GOOD-BYE, STUART. I LOVE YOU, GRANT. ( door shuts ) THERE ARE MOMENTS IN EACH OF OUR LIVES LIKE BIRTH AND DEATH WE MUST FACE ALONE. MOTHER TAUGHT US THAT. THE CHOICES OF THE HEART ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT CHOICES TO MAKE. THE ROAD AHEAD WAS DARK AND UNKNOWN AND I WAS AFRAID THERE WAS NO WAY BACK. ( sighs ) SCOPES! SCOPES! SIR? TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. &quot;MARGARET SANGER FLEES COUNTRY AFTER POST OFFICE RAID.&quot; ( groans ) IT'S UNBELIEVABLE, ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE. Margaret: &quot;MY DEAR, DEAR FAMILY &quot;HOW I MISS YOU ALL VERY MUCH. &quot;STUART, I TRUST THAT YOU'RE HELPING YOUR DAD &quot;KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS. &quot;HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GRANT. &quot;I SENT YOU A LITTLE GIFT. Bill: &quot;I HOPE YOU RECEIVED IT. &quot;PEGGY, HOW MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU. &quot;I COULD WEEP FOR THE LONELINESS FOR YOU. &quot;BUT WORK IS TO BE DONE, DEAR &quot;TO MAKE YOUR PATH EASIER &quot;AND FOR THOSE THAT COME AFTER. &quot;PROMISE TO WRITE SOON. LOVE, MOM.&quot; EVEN WITH MOTHER GONE, ANTHONY COMSTOCK STILL CAST HIS SHADOW OVER US. Little girl: MOMMY, MOMMY LOOK AT ME! MR. SANGER? YES, MAY I HELP YOU? UH, YEAH. YOUR WIFE, SHE NURSED MINE WHEN SHE WAS SICK. WE NEED HELP, SIR. I'M SORRY, I'M NOT A DOCTOR. NO, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU HAD ONE OF THOSE PAMPHLETS YOU KNOW, THAT TELLS THEM WHAT TO DO. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? HELLER, SIR, ARTHUR HELLER. I HATE TO TROUBLE YOU LIKE THIS BUT I CAN HARDLY FEED THE SEVEN MOUTHS I ALREADY GOT. THE MISSUS, YOU KNOW, SHE JUST AIN'T STRONG ENOUGH. WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR, MR. HELLER IS AGAINST THE LAW. OH, I WON'T TELL NO ONE, SIR, I SWEAR. IT'S JUST FOR THE SAKE OF MY KIDS. ALL RIGHT, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DIG ONE UP. COME BY MY OFFICE THIS EVENING. IT'S STANFORD WHITE'S, IT'S ACROSS FROM THE POST OFFICE. BUT DON'T COME BEFORE 5:00 P.M. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? OH, SURE. THANK YOU, SIR, I'M MIGHTY GRATEFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. SANGER. IT'S AFTER 5:00, JUST LIKE YOU SAID. I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS, SIR. THANK YOU. JUST KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. I WILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Man: HOLD IT THERE. YOU BASTARD! ( laughing ) I HAVE HERE A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST FROM THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE FOR DISTRIBUTING PORNOGRAPHY. MY PLEASURE. I WONDER IF I COULD SEE YOU JUST FOR A MINUTE HERE, PLEASE? IS THIS YOUR FAMILY? THAT'S ME IN THE PICTURE, ISN'T IT? YEAH, THAT IT IS, THAT IT IS. WELL, I THINK, UH... YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THEM. THIS CARRIES A STIFF SENTENCE. YOU KNOW THAT? YES. ALL RIGHT. NOW... WE, UH, WE COULD FORGET ABOUT THIS IF YOU TELL ME WHERE YOUR WIFE IS. GO TO HELL. OH, NO, NO. YOU'RE THE SINNER, I'D SAY. YOU'LL GO TO HELL. I WILL GO TO HEAVEN BUT, UH... YOU WILL GO TO HELL. BRING HIM ALONG. DOES THE DEFENDANT WISH TO MAKE A STATEMENT AT THIS TIME? YES, I DO, YOUR HONOR. UM, FIRST OF ALL, I ADMIT THAT I DID BREAK THE LAW. YET I SUBMIT THAT IT IS THE LAW THAT IS ON TRIAL HERE TODAY, NOT I. I AM A VICTIM OF MR. ANTHONY COMSTOCK, A MAN WITH INCURABLE SEX PHOBIA. A MAN WHO LACKS THE INTELLIGENCE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PORNOGRAPHY AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. YOU'RE A LIAR! ( gavel banging ) I'LL HAVE ORDER IN THIS COURT. MR. SANGER, I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF RIGAMAROLE ON THE RECORD. THIS PAMPHLET IS NOT ONLY INDECENT, IT'S IMMORAL. ITS CIRCULATION IS A MENACE TO SOCIETY. YOUR HONOR, IT ADVISES WOMEN ON HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND PREVENT UNWANTED PREGNANCIES. IF WOMEN WOULD ADVOCATE HAVING MORE CHILDREN WE'D BE MUCH BETTER OFF. HEAR, HEAR! ( applause ) IT IS THE DECISION OF THIS COURT TO SENTENCE YOU TO 30 DAYS IN JAIL. BAILIFF, REMOVE THIS MAN FROM THE COURTROOM. SENDING FATHER TO PRISON WAS ANTHONY COMSTOCK'S LAST GREAT VICTORY. TWO WEEKS LATER, HE TOOK ILL. OH, THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST SUCH A RIDICULOUS... THERE'S NOTHING... THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME. TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME! I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M JUST TIRED. MAN'S, MAN'S GOT A RIGHT TO BE TIRED. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME. LET ME HAVE MY HAT. HAT, PLEASE? ( yells ) ( groaning ) ( gasping ) YOU, YOU TELL THEM THAT I... AM A SERVANT OF GOD... AND... I AM... GOD'S WARRIOR. EVERYTHING AND NOTHING HAD CHANGED. ...WITH DEEP SORROW THAT WE ANNOUNCE THAT MR. ANTHONY COMSTOCK HAS BEEN CALLED TO THE BOSOM OF OUR LORD. HIS LIFE'S WORK, HOWEVER, WILL NOT BE IN VAIN. THE SOCIETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF VICE WILL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO PROSECUTE MARGARET SANGER. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. Reporter: THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. ( baby crying ) NEXT! MRS. SANGER? WHO ARE YOU? IT'S ALL RIGHT, FRIENDS SENT ME. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAFER. HOW WAS YOUR TRIP? LONG. WELCOME HOME, MRS. SANGER. MARGARET! OH, ANITA! IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. HELLO, MR. SCHLESINGER. WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE BACK THANK YOU. HOW'S BILL? HE'S FINE. HE SERVED HIS SENTENCE. THEY LET HIM OUT TWO DAYS AGO. OH, THANK GOD. HEARD ABOUT COMSTOCK. YES, HE'S DEAD, BUT YOUR ISSUES AREN'T. IT'S INCREDIBLE. THE PUBLIC SUPPORT BEHIND YOU IS TRULY ASTONISHING. I HOPE YOU'RE PREPARED FOR IT. LET'S GET YOU HOME. STAY CALM. AND DON'T GET OUT UNTIL I TELL YOU. POLICE ARE VERY TENACIOUS, AREN'T THEY? EXCUSE ME, HAVE A LIGHT? YEAH. OKAY, GOOD LUCK. I JUST GOT LOST LOOKING FOR WEST END AVENUE. OH... OH, MY BOYS! COME HERE. OH! OH! I MISSED YOU. LET ME LOOK AT YOU. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? MARGARET? DR. BENJAMIN, WHY...? I'M SORRY. I TRIED TO WIRE YOU, BUT YOU'D ALREADY LEFT. SHE, UM, STARTED TO... SLIP A FEW DAYS AGO. IT'S PNEUMONIA. PEGGY? PEGGY? MAMA. I'M HERE, BABY. MAMA? HMM? SING FOR ME? OH... YES, YES. COME HERE, DARLING, COME HERE. HERE WE GO. ♪ HUSH LITTLE BABY ♪ ♪ DON'T SAY A WORD ♪ ♪ MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A MOCKINGBIRD ♪ ♪ AND IF THAT MOCKINGBIRD DON'T SING ♪ ♪ MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A DIAMOND RING ♪ ♪ AND IF THAT DIAMOND RING TURNS BRASS ♪ ♪ MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A LOOKING GLASS ♪ ♪ AND IF THAT LOOKING GLASS GETS BROKE... ♪ ♪ MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A BILLY GOAT ♪ ♪ AND IF THAT BILLY GOAT DON'T PULL... ♪ ( sniffling ) ♪ AND IF... ♪ ♪ THAT HORSE AND CART... ♪ ♪ FALL DOWN... ♪ ♪ YOU'RE STILL THE SWEETEST LITTLE GIRL IN TOWN. ♪ Mr. Higgins: THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD, I SHALL NOT WANT. HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES HE LEADETH ME BESIDE THE STILL WATERS. HE RESTORETH MY SOUL. HE LEADETH ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH I WILL FEAR NO EVIL. FOR THOU ART WITH ME. THY ROD AND THY STAFF, THEY COMFORT ME. ...SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE. AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER. NOW YOU BOYS BE GOOD TO EACH OTHER, OKAY? HELP EACH OTHER OUT. I NEED YOU TO BE STRONG FOR ME. CAN YOU DO THAT? YUP. YUP. OKAY. GOOD. LET'S NOT KEEP THE BASTARDS WAITING. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. THANK YOU. HELLO. BILL. THEY'VE ONLY GIVEN ME A FEW MINUTES. HOW ARE THE BOYS? IS STUART PICKING ON GRANT? BOYS ARE FINE. THEY HAVE THEIR MOTHER'S STOIC BEARING. UNTERMEYER TOLD ME YOU WERE OFFERED A DEAL. YOU COULD BE OUT IN A FEW MONTHS. I CAN'T ACCEPT IT, BILL. THEY WANT ME TO WRITE A LETTER OF APOLOGY. MARGARET... IF I ALLOW THEM TO SHUT ME UP, THEN THEY WIN. AND ALL OF THIS WILL BE FOR NOTHING. YOU ARE ONE HEADSTRONG PERSON. DO YOU KNOW THAT, MARGARET SANGER? HEADSTRONG, WILLFUL... DISOBEDIENT. ( sighing ) IT'S FIVE YEARS, MARGARET. THAT'S A LONG TIME, IF THEY CONVICT. I KNOW. DO YOU THINK I MAKE MY CHOICE LIGHTLY? WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND I DREAMT ABOUT PEGGY. ALMOST EVERY OTHER NIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHY. THINKING ABOUT IT NOW IT SEEMS ALMOST... LIKE A PREMONITION. ONLY IN MY DREAMS I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS ABANDONED LEFT ON THE SHORE WITH PEGGY WAVING TO ME FROM A SAILING SHIP. IF NOT FOR THE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO WILL SURELY DIE THEN FOR PEGGY, BILL I CANNOT TURN AWAY. AND THE BOYS? THE BOYS WILL GET THEIR MOTHER BACK EVENTUALLY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND IN THE MEANTIME, THEY'RE STRONG AND THEY KNOW I LOVE THEM. AND... ME? I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, BILL SANGER. BUT THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE IN THE DAYS AND THE MONTHS TO COME AND I'LL BE NEEDED. ( door opens ) ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ( door clangs shut ) ( phone ringing ) AFTERNOON, WHITMAN. I THOUGHT WE SHOULD REVIEW OUR STRATEGY ON THE MARGARET SANGER CASE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MR. SCOPES? I'M BEGINNING TO GROW TIRED OF THIS WHOLE BUSINESS. IT'S LIKE A BOMB EXPLODING IN OUR FACES. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY LETTERS I'VE RECEIVED IN SUPPORT OF MRS. SANGER? THE PRESIDENT'S WIFE SENT ONE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MRS. WILSON THERE IS ONE CONSIDERATION IN THIS CASE AND THAT, SIR, IS VIRTUE. CHRISTIAN VIRTUE. AND I'M UP FOR REELECTION. SO TO PUT IT IN A NUTSHELL, MR. SCOPES THIS ISSUE IS NO LONGER ABOUT GOD OR THE DEVIL IT'S ABOUT POLITICS. GOOD DAY. ( scoffing ): POLITICS! ( footsteps approaching ) ( applause and cheering ) THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MY BOYS. ARE THEY GOING TO KEEP YOU IN JAIL? I DON'T KNOW, HONEY. COME HERE. GIVE 'EM HELL, MOTHER. ALL RISE. YOU MAY BE SEATED. BAILIFF. CASE 1272-B THE PEOPLE V. MARGARET SANGER. THE DEFENDANT STANDS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING FEDERAL OBSCENITY LAWS. YOUR HONOR... I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT. ONE MOMENT, MRS. SANGER. ( gavel bangs ) MR. WHITMAN. THE PROSECUTION REQUESTS THAT NO STATEMENT BE READ AT THIS TIME, YOUR HONOR. ( crowd groaning ) ( gavel banging ) YOU CAN CONTINUE, MR. WHITMAN. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION THE PROSECUTION HAS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MRS. SANGER IS NOT A DISORDERLY PERSON AND NO HARM HAS COME FROM HER PUBLICATIONS. THEREFORE, YOUR HONOR, AT THIS TIME WE REQUEST THAT ALL CHARGES AGAINST MRS. SANGER BE DROPPED. SAVE YOUR STATEMENT FOR THE PRESS, MRS. SANGER. CASE DISMISSED. ( gavel bangs ) THIS IS AN OUTRAGE! ( crowd applauding loudly ) Reporters: MRS. SANGER, MRS. SANGER... ( reporters all asking questions ) Man: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS VICTORY? HOW DOES YOUR HUSBAND FEEL? MOM! WE LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU, TOO! EACH OF US TAKES A JOURNEY DOWN A DIFFERENT ROAD. IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD HOW THE CHOICES MOTHER MADE HOW HER FAITH AND COURAGE WOULD ONE DAY BRING OUR ROADS BACK TOGETHER... BYE, MOM. ...IN A BETTER WORLD.
