Please arrange information regarding the R K School situated in Maaruru Ms.Shalini Ms.Shalini..Please come here for a moment What Raghav? Look at this More than 1300 Government Schools have been shut down in Karnataka. In the past two years Citing lack of adequate number of children But.. Next to each closed Government School On an average-3 private Schools have started It looks like there is a big Mafia behind this Even I am feeling the same Proprietor name - Ravi Kallal 15 years back - One who used to supply books to Schools Today - owns 15 corporate Schools His contacts range from local MLA to Delhi A corporate Businessman cum Mafia Don Legally there is not even a single FIR against him All his crimes are neatly planned and executed He doesn't leave any clues He is not involved in any of the cases He is personally not involved in any promotions Only his brand is visible everywhere One of his corporate Schools will be opening in the next town That is the only place where You will have a chance to see him directly All the secrets that I have collected is stored this Thanks Mate! Wish you good luck! He is very powerful Going against him is not as easy as we think We can't win against him through power We should device a different strategy R K Sir is arriving now Chief Minister (C M) is on the way Ask the security to be alert Everything is alright Madam Why is it that there is such a small crowd? Wasn't the timing communicated properly? Madam.. Our village children are hosting a street magic show on the approaching road Oh! The crowd is engaged over there The road should be clear when the C M comes Inform the Police and clear the road immediately Mam.. People who are over there are Parents and Children who are supposed to come here Mam.. We better handle this carefully Ohh.. What to do now? Fine.. ..I will go myself and monitor the situation Suraj..Look after the arrangements here Ok Mam Dear ladies and Gentlemen Welcome to all Sorry for the inconvenience There is a small change in our cultural program I have found a wonderful talent in our village children I am proud to introduce them in front of you Now.. ..I am callin Khushigagi Team on the stage Are you wondering who I am? My name is R K Namaste Mr. R K Sit down U K Tell me one thing Kallal.. Whenever I come you welcome me addressing me as "U K" What does that mean? Does it mean that I am the "Universal King"? No "Undappa Kattimani" It's not Undappa.. It's Ugrappa "Ugrappa Kattimani" Let it be Let's get to the matter It's been 3/4th of a century since our Nation got Independence But.. Politicians like you couldn't change the destiny of these kids who go to Government Schools And it won't be possible either In place of those old slippers.. What if there are formal shoes? In place of those ragged clothes.. What if there are blazers? Instead of these kids walking to the School.. What if there is a School bus? How will that be? These things are practically impossible If these Government School kids are given shoes.. ..They will roam around the village, Muck it up, tear it throw it away And if they are provided with uniforms.. They will roam around the fences and.. ..Will end up with 4 holes in their shirts and shorts respectively and.. ..End up revealing their bums Also will torch the buses No..No..No..No..! They will study happily prosper If people prosper.. ..We will prosper in turn I am opening 50 new corporate Schools overall Karnataka You already are doing well with 10-15 Schools U K..U K..U K.. Increasing production according to demand Is the talent of clever businessmen like me U K.. Haven't we spread the fear that there is no value.. ..for the ones studying in Government Schools? That plan has clicked very well Instead of "How my Son is studying?".. "Where is he studying?' Has become the status symbol for these parents That is our selling point Tell me directly What is it that you are expecting from me? See to it that all the Government Schools around the places that I have marked Are closed Stop this nonsense Sorry Sir Ravi Kallal.. Very interesting They are acting very well They are no less to legendary actors Don't disturb them Please Sit down You continue Ok fine I shall get them closed Kallal.. In Hubballi.. ..I am building a complex in the name of my second wife There is a shortage of funds I will give you 20 crores Kallal.. ..It's a 50 floors complex 50 crores Fine then Citing the reason that there is a shortage of children in the Government Schools.. ..Will shut them down But our C M.. .. Is a firm believer in Gandhian values What to do regarding it? If that "Gandhi" is given Gandhi notes He will worship the Gandhi in those notes Who invited them here? Send them out Please leave us Sir Leave us uncle Aey..Stop it! Don't be hasty Don't trouble the kids Police..look at them Please leave me Varun..Varun.. I am really Sorry Sir! Sorry for the inconvenience Some street show artists are trying to damage my image Sir Sir.. With your permission.. Can I say a few words? Yes Go Ahead! Sir.. What you said is 100% right Your brand has a very high value That is the reason we parents follow it My son is one among these children He is studying in one of the corporate Schools My son Varun.. ..Is very talented Sir There is no example of him taking less than 98% marks in any of the exams I was proud that he will be going to double my status One day.. He went away from his parents who had brought him up with such love and affection We didn't hit him or torture him We just asked him why he had scored low marks in the exam But.. One who made us realize our mistake was.. ..Ms. Shalini If there is a marriage of a close relative 2 days prior to the exams.. Study instead of attending the wedding You can attend weddings later But.. Career is important Focus on your career Saying Focus on your Education We will make them study By doing so.. Aren't we the one who teach our children that.. Career is more important than relationships? The same children.. ..After they grow up.. ..Fly abroad Leaving their parents behind What's their mistake in doing so? But.. ..Ms.Shalini has made my Son return to me with best qualities Ms. Shalini.. Ms. Shalini.. ..Wherever you are.. ..Please come forward As Mr.Gopal is narrating I haven't done any big thing Children's natural desire is to learn something new We just have to encourage and Inspire them by watering their curiosities They will learn everything by themselves That is what I did But.. Those who treat education as business and want to mint money through it To enhance the brand value of their institutions "Marks" will be their key point Such people will make their children read and write for the entire day Finally..Killing their prowess.. ..Will turn them into "Book worms" "100% Results" "80% Distinction" "10 Ranks" It's a status symbol for parents like us to get our.. ..children admitted to such advertise wielding institutions Locking up all kinds of baby animals in a classroom.. ..And teach them to climb trees.. ..An infant monkey may score 100% marks A cheetah cub and Kitten may score distinction Considering this..How right is it to call a Horse stab as a fool? A Horse's skill is in running Because of imaginary world created by such people.. ..Many Government Schools are being shut down Sir.. I request you that our village's School which is shut down.. ..To be re-opened with a new education system We have to make everyone who looked disgracefully towards Government Schools.. ..Return towards them respectfully That is my Humble request In our Country.. ..Many people who studied in Government Schools.. ..Have been holding distinguished posts. Have become the President of India Have become the Prime Minister of India Besides that.. ..Haven't I - A Government School student Become the Chief Minister? What kind of School we study in is not important The knowledge we imbibe is important Do we use the knowledge imbibed for the welfare of the society or not is more important I have found many proofs regarding this case Considering this case seriously I am handing it over to the CBI Thank you very much..!! A MAN MAY BE HIGLY EDUCATED AND INTELLIGENT BUT WILL NOT.. ..HAVE ANY VALUE IF HE CAN'T RESPECT OTHER'S FEELINGS DON'T LOOSE RELATIONSHIPS IN PURSUIT OF INTELLIGENCE 6 MONTHS LATER CBI enquiry has revealed that R K Group of Institutions head Ravi Kallal.. ..Is directly involved in the closure of more than 50 Government Schools Enquiry has revealed Education Minister being his accomplice.
