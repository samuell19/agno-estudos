You don't leave until I say so. I mean, you know what I got to do. God, I got to help you get your act back together. What am I supposed to do? Hmm. You see, Miss Ginger, what you've got to do, is you got to learn that nobody ever walks out on me. You understand me? Never! They never walk out on me. And you and me, you and me, baby, we're gonna go on helping each other, till I say we don't need to help each other no more. When you've learned that lesson, Ginger, you're gonna feel so good. I mean, you'll feel happy about yourself. You know what I mean, hmm? Now you look at me when I'm talking to you. Do you know what time it is? It's school time. You ain't gonna be able to give my money maker away for quite a while. Lesson number one, Ginger. - Six Abel seven, at 546 E, 327 North Hayward. You're all clear six Victor 10. No messages. - Ah.

Well, can't blame a girl for trying. - Hey, Lou, come over here and get this bum out of my face, huh? - Hey, who belongs to these two whores? - We ain't no whores, Mr. Hunky Policeman. We're prostitutes. - There's a difference? - Whores give it away. Stupid. - Hey, wasn't somebody supposed to take this kid to juvenile? - What the fuck makes you think I wanna go to juvenile. - You think you're tough, don't you, kid?

You tell me the truth now. Ramrod did this to you. It was Ramrod wasn't it? Huh? - No. He loves me. - That stoned psycho doesn't love anybody. What if you don't make it, huh? - I'm gonna make it. I don't wanna die. - Easy, easy. I'm gonna get that son of a bitch if it's the last thing I ever do. - Not on that death bed statement you won't.

That drug bust of yours is good for three to 10. - Come on, Walsh. Get off my back. You know I don't use dope, Walsh. So why don't you just lighten up. - You don't have to sell me, baby.

Just tell me what you got on your mind. - I want you to operate a pimp by the name of Ramrod. - Go put sand up your ass, Walsh. Do you know what that psycho son of a bitch gets off on? He gets off on cutting up girls. - And with your help we could put him away. - You got big balls, Walsh. You know I got a kid. What's she gonna do if that snake trusses me up to some bed? - You don't have any choice. It's either this or the slammer. And personally, lady, I don't think you can handle the time. - Well, I could stay alive, man. 24 hours after he's in, he's out. That's no fucking jail you're operating there. It's a hotel with a revolving door. - I don't need some fucking bimbo telling me what's wrong with the system. - You know what you can do with your system, honey? - What about Ginger Grady? She's a friend of yours, isn't she? Huh? - You know we're tight. You got a dope bust on me for carrying her shit. - Well, would you do it if she talked to you? Huh? - What did you do, bust her too? - No, not exactly, but I think she wants to talk to you. Look at her, Princess. Listen to her. Listen to her real good. Ramrod did that to her. He beat the shit out of her. And he used a pimp stick on her. - You face him, fucking coward. - What's the matter with you? Don't you care? All you is sit around all day saying, "He beat me, beat me." How are we supposed to protect if you don't let us help you? Look, look at her. Look at her, Princess.

Oh, you know, the same old bull shit. I busted a pimp for tying his girlfriend up to a bed and then pouring lighter fluid all over and setting her on fire. - I went around the world twice. - Hmm. Then there was the 13-year-old hooker I nailed for covering some guy's joint on Sunset Boulevard. Two dead junkies. One is 16, the other one's 14. - Well, I spanked a couple of freaks. - Just another happy-go-lucky day on the vice squad. - We both live in the same toilet, Walsh. Thanks for the hot dog. - Hey Let me give you a ride home. - Well, I got my beauty sleep this morning. I'm a working girl in case you forgot. - You're gonna go to work tonight? - Well, I need the bread. I can't get set up in another town for free. - Well, hey, hey. Wait a minute. I'm giving you a loan here. - Walsh, you are full of surprises. You don't make enough in a month to loan me what I need. - Yeah, well, maybe you could lend me a 20. - She's pretty. - Yeah, she was. - Ciao. Keep it clean, Walsh. - Look at the bright side, asshole. You got 20 years to learn how to play with yourself. - I'm sorry. - My friend is right, butt breath. You don't need women anymore. A few jerk-off pictures maybe. - Hey, Mendez, with his talent, he could pimp the bunboys. - Ooh, la la. Hey! - Get out of my way! - Walsh is gonna kill us. - I can understand why you're upset. - You're a lucky man, Kowalski. You're very lucky that Ramrod kicked your face in and not me because I would have done a much better job of it. - Tom? Tom, take it easy, man. Take it easy. - You said he's out of control. Okay, everybody knows that these two officers lost Ramrod. Now, what are we gonna do about that, huh? Huh? We got two people out there on the street. Bottom line is this. That unless we pick one of them up, we got a dead girl on our hands. Is that clear? I mean, it's very simple, isn't it? We find them. One or the other. Now, let's hit the streets. You apprehend the bastard if he moves. If he so much as blinks or scratches his ass, you waste him. You got that? I want him out of commission, not you. - Oh, please, please. - Easy, easy, easy. - Please help me. - It's okay. I'll get somebody here to help in a minute.

Don't you want straight sex? - No. No, I want... - Hmmm, what do you want? - I want to suck your toes. - Ooh, okay, I'll go wash up. - Oh, no. No, that won't be necessary. - Hmm. It seems to me that you have been very naughty. - Yes. I've been a pretty bad boy. - Mm-hmm. Well, since you paid extra, I think you deserve a good spanking. - How're you doing, Eddie? - Think this will do? - Oh, that's beautiful. That'll do just fine. - Here's the rest of your stuff. - Hey, Eddie? - Yo. - What kind of shit are you trying to hand me? I want an automatic, you understand? Automatic. And I want it right now, before I redecorate that pretty little head of yours. Now move. - Ramrod. You bad. All you got to do his ask. But automatics are expensive. - But don't you worry, all right?

Edwards, there's two days out of every week I don't worry about. Yesterday and tomorrow. Now where the fuck is she? - Thanks for the treatment, Doc. And don't go spending my money all in the same place, huh? - Don't worry. - Hey, when you get settled in San Diego, you let me know where you're at, because, you're sure worth the trip. - Okay. Bye, Tim. - Hey, Sugar baby. I'll catch you later, okay? - My main man, Silky. I want to talk to you so pay attention. Look at those photographs. - Get out of my face, mama. You ain't got no right to be leaning on me.

That is fast. - Well, he knows my pussy can make no money sitting in the slammer. - You having a good night? - Nothing but Greeks and freaks. I tell you nobody wants straight sex anymore. - I got lucky. I have a date tonight with guy who was hung like a horse. I mean, so big, he had to get it hard in sections. - I had a clock watcher. He thought I was charging him by the minute. - Girl, these kinda freaks, they're all alike. They wanna pop twice for the same price. - Here's to freaks. - Yeah, freaks. - Hey, beautiful. How'd you like a trip to paradise. - Now, that depends. You a friend or foe? - Sweetheart, you're looking at a horny conventioneer. - Listen to him. - See this face? Seen more ass than a cowboy's saddle. Think you can handle me? - Mister, I can handle the whole god damn convention. - She can handle two conventions. - See you later, Princess. - See you later. I'll keep it short and sweet. - Whoo, I know you will. - Bye, Princess. - Bye, sweetheart. Have fun. ♪ This is the night ♪ ♪ For sure ♪ - I'm coming, I'm coming. ♪ I have everything ♪ - Now I understand that you know a bitch named Princess. Am I right, boy? - Man, I haven't seen her. Oh, please, man, you're hurting me. - I'm hurting you. Where does she live, boy? - She never told me. - Where does she hang out? Huh, huh? Bars, motels. Answer me. - Hollywood, Hollywood. - Hollywood? Where in Hollywood? - Sunset. - Where, where? Where? - The Golden Motel, man. - Shh. Shh, shh. You know what the problem is that you sugar pimps have? You don't know how to handle your bitches. Why? 'Cause I don't think you got any balls, boy. - Hey, bitch. What the fuck am I paying you for? Come on. Come on move it. Move your ass, bitch. - What the fuck are you doing? - You're a lousy piece of ass. I'm taking my money back. - Give my purse, you fucking... - Jesus. What did you do? Fucked the whole football team? You know, you're lucky I'm not charging you for wasting my time. - Go ahead, motherfucker. I got a nigger pimp so mean, when he gets through with you, you'll pray you'll die. Asshole. Asshole. You'll pray you'll die, you lousy fucking asshole. - He's not at all anxious to be an accessory to murder. Are you, Roscoe, baby? Right. Ramrod's driving a 1979 Ford Brougham, just repainted blue. Also get a team over to Fast Eddie's bar. Ramrod went there to get a gun. You're so cooperative, Roscoe. Nice, Roscoe. - Office. - Mrs. Cruikshank, do me a favor and get me some clean sheets, will ya? - Her Royal Highness thinks this is the fucking Plaza Hotel. Who's move is it, Wong? - I believe it is mine, Mrs. Cruikshank. Come, beat me. - Six Victor three, we just covered the Hollywood Bowl area. We drew a blank. - Shit. - Six Victor seven, have you got anything? - Six Victor seven, negative. We're at Hollywood and Cahuenga. - Well, Princess, ain't we the popular one tonight. - What are you talking about? - Someone's waiting for you in the parking lot. Asked for you by name. 25 bucks. - Pardon me. Are you Miss Princess? - Well, that depends. - As I told Madam Cruikshank, you were referred to me by a certain Miss Coco. My employer would like to avail himself of your services. - Now what does he have in mind? - You'll have to discuss that with him. - Hello, Walsh. I thought I better let you in on this one. - What have you got, Brooks? - Some joker just cut the gonads off a sugar pimp named Dorsey. Could have been your boy. Dorsey said he was looking for a little hooker named Princess. - Did he tell Ramrod where to find her? - Yeah, he said the Golden Motel. - Oh, shit. That's the other end of the strip. All six Victor units, suspect heading for Golden Motel, Sunset and Cahuenga. - Where's Princess? - Cool it, you big palooka. You're gonna get us killed. - We're coming up against a psycho asshole who can blow us away, man. You're worried about a fucking little fender bender. - Who's worried about a fucking fender bender? Doesn't anything scare you? - Yeah, man. All the time. Why do you think I have those god damn nightmares every night? - Those are just dreams. Plain, every day, ordinary dreams. Watch it! This is a nightmare. Take it, Kowalski. What in the hell happened here? - You pigs are always alike. A day later, a dollar short. And that's the truth. - Did Mr. Cleaver tap-dance through here? - Get the hell out of here. - Listen, lady. Is this the guy? - Get the hell out of here. - She's my friend. You better leave Madam Cruikshank alone. - Get this ornamental out of my face. Hey, man, not the nose. - Okay, Bruce Lee, enough of that shit. - My name is Wong, not Lee. - Okay, Wong. - Okay! You, son of a bitch. - Not the nose. - Freeze, mister. Where's Ramrod? - We missed him, Tom. What a way to make a living. - I'll say. I think I'll shoot the bastard. - Wouldn't look good on the six o'clock news. - Okay, Cruikshank, what did you tell Ramrod? - I didn't tell him nothing. - Bullshit. If you didn't tell him anything, you wouldn't be alive right now. - I didn't tell him nothing. - Hey, Dixie. Come on over here. Come on, come on, baby. All I wanna do is talk to you. How you doing, Dixie? - Listen, Ramrod, my pimp sees me talking to you, he'll beat the shit out of me. - Shh, just relax, bitch. Now what can you tell me about a big, Cadillac limousine. - Oh, that's Coco's gig. - That's Coco's gig, huh? Who the fuck is Coco, bitch? - Just one of the girls. - Which one? - The one in the pink, at the corner there. Please, please. Please, Ramrod. - Shh. - Okay. - Hello. - Well, hello, beautiful. - Are you a cop? - Am I a cop? What do I look like some kind of fucking pig? - Maybe. You looking for a date? - Yeah, yeah, I'm looking for a date. Why don't you come here a little closer. I hear you're good. Are you real good? - Hmm, well, well, I had no complaints. - Where did that Cadillac take the Princess? I said, where did it take her? Where? - Coco! No! - Hey, what the... - Shh. Remember, not a word. You agreed. - Sick old fuck head. You scared the shit out of me. - You ruined it, slut. Roberts told you not to talk. You ruined it. - I could have died of a fucking heart attack. - Roberts. Roberts. She talked. - I instructed her not to, sir. - But she did. Get that slut out of here. - Yes, sir. Please, come with me. - Belong in a fucking loony bin, you son of a bitch. Jesus Christ, why didn't you warn me? - I have my instructions. You better go change. - That old shit should have died 50 years ago. - There's a taxi waiting for you, Miss Princess. - I'm not paying for it. - It's been taken care of. Do you work every night? - Forget it, I've already had my scare for the week. - No, you don't understand. Tomorrow night's my night off. Will you be working? - I'll be in church asking God to forgive that old fuck. - Get on the horn, partner, and tell him we found Coco. - Female, oriental, located. Advised as friendly. Possibly at 7th and Rossmore. - Roger, central. This is six Victor 10 to all six Victor units. We have a location on Princess. Converge at 7th and Rossmore. I repeat, converge at 7th and Rossmore. Put the hammer to it, Edwards. - Hi, Ma. Hi, it's me. I'm sorry I'm calling so late, but, oh, I just got to thinking about Lisa. - I don't give a damn what he did. Look what he did to Coco. - I couldn't help it. He had a knife to my face. - I don't give a damn. Look what he did to Coco. Listen, I don't want to talk to you. I don't care what the problem was. You shouldn't have told him anything. - There's Princess! - Oh, I wish you wouldn't cry. - I think we better tell her about Ramrod. Oh, my God! - What's the matter? - There he is. Princess! - Hey, lady! What do you think you're doing? - Hello, Princess. I got you. - Somebody call the cops. - And she left just a few minutes ago. - But you didn't hear her tell the driver where she wanted to go? - I thought she... - Walsh, he's got her. He's in a white pickup truck. He was last seen on Van Ness, heading south on Santa Monica. - Put out an APB. - I put out a kidnapping broadcast. - Come on. - Hey, where are we going? - South on Van Ness and Santa Monica. - Okay, here we go. Move out. Cover the side streets. Okay, let's go. You black and whites cover Bronson. Kowalski, you take Pico. We'll take Van Ness. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Central, any word of pickup truck? Nothing yet, six Victor 10. We have everyone working on it. Do you plan on running surveillance? - Affirmative, we have to find him first. - Pico from Van Ness to Vermont. No sign. - Continue east on Pico. - Six Victor seven, what is your location? - We're heading north on Western, south of Washington. This is one Mary, M32 to six Victor 10. We have spotted suspect vehicle heading east on Beverly and Linden. We are following. - Roger, one Mary X-ray two. Vehicle is not, repeat is not under any circumstances to be apprehended. We will establish a point and maintain a moving surveillance. - Suspect vehicle is now heading south on Oxford. - Six Victor seven, we are closest, we'll pick 'em up. - Okay, you got the point. Listen, six Victor seven and all other units. Do not close in on Ramrod. If he sees us, he'll kill Princess. We'll close in when he lands. - Ramrod heading east on Olympic, driving erratically. - We got the back door, about a half a mile behind. Now keep it cool, we don't want to burn him. - Roger. - Six Victor three, where are you? - We are parallel to the vehicle, heading east on Pico. - Bitch. - Ramrod now heading east on Almeida at 4th. I think we might get burned. So we're peeling off. - Roger, six Victor seven. Six Victor three, take the point, but stay out of sight. - We've got him, he's on Almeida passing 1st. - You like to bite? - The asshole's crossing the 6th Street Bridge. - Drop back. Don't crowd him. - Ah! Bitch! - That's it. Our pigeon has landed. It's a warehouse, corner of 7th and Mill Street. - To all six Victor units, move in. - Roger. - You see, Princess, what I did to Ginger, it ain't nothing, compared to what I'm going to do to you. No more kicking, bitch. No more scratching, you understand me? 'Cause now it's my turn. You fuck. Ow! God damn it! - Where are they? - I think they're up there in the fifth floor. - I'm going to find you, bitch. You hear me? I'm going to find you. It's over. Over. - We found this in the pickup. - Looks like they're on the fifth floor. - How many accesses? - Well, there is the stairs here and the fire escape's in the back. - The freight elevator's been shut off. - Edwards and I will take the fire escape. You and Kowalski take the stairs. Louise and Chris back them up, take a couple of uniforms with you. Wait for my signal. Let's go. Fire escape. - Pop Oh, yes. Oh yes, I love it. - No! - Oh, yeah, yeah. - No! - It's payday. - Oh, God, no. No, please. Please, no. Oh, no. Don't, please. - Ready? - We're ready. - Go. - Freeze! Hold it motherfucker. - Son of a bitch. - I'm right behind you. - Watch it, by the window. There on the roof. - Check fire escape. God damn it. Get an ambulance. - Right away, sarge. Cover the fire escape. - Just get him. - You take care of her. Come on, Chris. - Hey, move. I said move. - Freeze. - Jump, you asshole. - Six Victor 10, where are you? What... - 13 to Sergeant, one central. - Just take it easy. It's gonna be all right, okay? Okay. - Keep the stretcher level. - Be careful. Phone ahead and alert them. - Is he gonna make it? - If he doesn't, I'll kill the son of a bitch. - I think this belongs to you. - For Christ's sake, Walsh. It has blood all over it. - Well, I'll get you another one. - I don't know why you do it.
