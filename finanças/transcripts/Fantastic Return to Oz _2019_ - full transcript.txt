Urfin! Urfin! Urfin! Urfin! Urfin! Urfin! Master. It's time. Master! It's time. Master, they're here. What the... Release my great and terrible foot, chamber pot! Unwashed horde! Yes, you. The great... Seriously? The great and terrible Urfin Jus, your wise and attractive leader, commandeth the sun to rise! Err... To Rise! Right now! Where is it? You imbecile! An excellent question. You maggots got me up too early. I command you to stop throwing ponas. There you are. It's about time. Urfin says... Sunrise! There. You see that? Every day, I give you the sun. I force it to shine. Which, by the way, is super hard. But I do it, for you. What'll you do for me? Tell me. Is the sunshine worth attacking Emerald City? Of course it is. So get to it! Now move! For the glory of your omnipotent leader! Come on, you brutes. The city will soon be mine! Stupid peasants, ruining my plans. They're cheering for you. That's nice. And, umm, they bring you yummy food. Yummy food? Yummy food, smummy food! They're supposed to be my army! Army? For what? Where have you been? Taking Emerald City! Oh, yeah... ashoo! But wait... achoo! - What? - Sorry everyone. Achoo, achoo, achoo! Pull yourself together, Clown. Tell me. Achoo! Achoo! Achoo! Master. King Gamma's book. You can scare 'em with it. Remember how scared you were the first time you opened it? Hmm. That really might work. Good thing I thought of it! Brilliant! It's crazy, scary. Plus, it's entire crazed. Tell 'em they have to attack the city because the book ordered it. Get me that book! Ooh! That sounds nice! Yeah! Friends! Friends! It's been an entire year since we defeated the wicked Urfin Jus! And on this special day and above all, we remember our beloved Dorothy, fairy of the Silver Slippers! To Emerald City, from our friends in Wikkietown, a wonderful present! Not just a statue! She can move! Plus, she can even dance! And if need be, she can protect us from any harm, just as well as the real Dorothy! She really looks like the real thing! Every bit is beautiful. - Every bit is reliable. - Reliable? Of course. She is metal, after all. Which is exactly why I thought it'd be the safest hiding place for King Gamma's book! I'm very smart. Ruf Bilan! For real? Urfin. Is he coming back? In time. And you're on his dining list! But I... But I'm a faithful servant! Hey! Ruf Bilan! The boss is asking what the problem is. Er... There was a glitch, but I dealt with it. Not badly done, for a turncoat idiot. It's time. Strasheela's a dead man. A dead man? What do you mean? He gave me a second chance. Yeah. And if you behave yourself, Urfin just might give you a third one. Really? You think? Yeah, sure. Where's King Gamma's book? Where's the book? At the top. Up there. Dumb. This is dumb. I can't do this. I can't! Just talk me through it one more time. We've already gone through it thirty four times! Well... Just once more. The thirty fifth time will be the charm! Just do it. You're an app! So I'm just an app. Don't my feelings matter? Fine! One more time. Today, you will be pro-active and assertive! Give her the flowers. Put 'em in a vase. To prove you're awesome! And do everything with lotsa style! Whose style again? Whose do ya think? Mine. You don't have any. Ahh. Got it. Sure. You did not just wreck in her yard? - But, just a little. - Wow. Alright. After the flowers, help her. With the phone, or computer. Use your nerd fu. Should I sneak and break something, so I can fix it? No. You're about as stealthy as a tornado. - You're right. So, am I ready? - Ish. Can I... come in? You kind of already did. Come on in! But my room's a mess. Oh, trust me. This isn't a mess. You should see my room. Seriously! It looks like a black hole threw up! I made this. It's for you. Sort of a souvenir. These are for you as well. Well, thanks! I was wondering if they were for me, or for the dog. Put 'em in the vase. Show her you're awesome! I'll get it! I got it! My phone! Oh, that? It's nothing. It's a screen protector. We'll replace it. You can have my phone. It's got this app that's really cool. One that I designed. It's called 'New Best Friend.' Next, put four eggs into a bowl... Uhh... Not this. This is... It's called 'My Chef.' A different app. So... You're studying cooking? Well, yeah. Sort of. - Look. Here. - High there! Wow! You are pretty! Thank you app! Tim talks about you, like, all the time! Listen, hot mess puberty stuff aside, he's actually a great guy. Just sayin'! Dorothy! I made tea and cookies for you and that Tim boy! Awesome! Thank you! - Want some? - Mm hmm. I'll get some. Yes! Ahh. It's right there! Wow! That's weird. Ha ha ha ha ha. And now, let's see if you remember how to talk. In order to turn the page, and read more of the book, first one must put on the silver slippmphs... I don't have the slippers. But it's fine. Carraci! Behold! In order to turn the page, and read more of the book, first one must put on... The book has commanded you to attack Emerald City! It's working, isn't it? The slippers! The Silver Slippers. Gimme those! I can't. They aren't mine. You heard him. Give 'em here! None may threaten the master of the Silver Slippers. What's going on? Where am I? Is this a dream? It's no dream. It's a real life adventure! Come on! Show me what's going on! Wahoe! This is next level link! Put it out! Oh, wait. Have I gone nuts? Ah, I'll check my database. Meanwhile, say hello! - Say hello, c'mon! - Hello there. Here. I've found 'em. Primitive tribes, smelly and ferocious, but, good natured. Human sacrifices... Pop a chillaxitive. Let me finish. Human sacrifices are a thing of the far distant past. - What's it mean? - I've found their language, but... It only has three letters. 'Sink of the sun. We want rain.' There! No biggie. Just make it rain. Are you for real? How can I make it rain? What shall I do? Who? Who could've stolen the book? Maybe that suspicious looking old lady? But why would she need it? It doesn't make any sense. You need the Silver Slippers to use the book, but Dorothy has the slippers, and she isn't here. - Weird. - It's weird, but it did happen. Yes. I just can't see the point of it. But I'm curious. Have your soldiers spoken with her? Yes sir! They spoke with her. Well, they kind of yelled... She was running away; they yelled in her general direction. Alright then. I guess... we need to find the old lady with the baby. You may begin. Wait! Back! It's the Clown and the Bear! Urfin's minions! Let's check the statue again. There might be something we missed the first time. - An Ogre! - Well, hi! - Let go! - But you'd fall and go splatty! - No! Anything but splatties! - Up or down? Pull us up! Hi! I am tickled pink you're here! Wow. Why are you scared? Oh! You must be thinking of last time. I've got a secret to tell you. It'll make all that fear flit away! Try - to guess - how - I - changed. Give up? I've gone fully Vegan! Say what? No you haven't. Really. I am a happy, healthy, kale snarfing enlightened sweety. Help! He's marinating me in... in.. Jelly, maybe? Now he's giving me a sponge bath. Heh heh. Total like! The change hasn't really helped your odour though, has it? Umm... Have you seen my friend? Like, has anyone else fallen out of the sky today? No. - Just you and the talking toupee. - Weird. Tim! - Tim! - So who's this Tim? Just some silly boy. He's dumb and sweet. Brings Dorothy flowers. - He's in love. - Ah, love. I've heard of that. - Tim! - It's a strange thing. Hey, give it a rest! You'll break your barking box. Shouldn't he have ended up in the same place as us? Remember not to forget where you are. Anything can happen in Oz. So how can I find him? Oh! The crow will know. Yoo hoo! Brain bird! Hello there. - Check out this fairy I just caught! - Dorothy! Join me for dinner? Oh no! You won't get away with this, you monster! What are you doing? Wait! Nobody knows I've gone Vegan. I've got a fierce image to maintain. - It's part of the plan. - Part of what plan? The crow will tell everyone you're my prisoner. Wherever he is, Tim will hear it and come save you. Like a knight in shining armour, right? Oh, he'll come. You'll see. He gave you flowers, didn't he? Toto! You little gossip! I like you better when you can't talk. No you don't. Do you think he'll really do it? Quick! You need to tell me the way home now! - While they're distracted. - Are you nuts? You sit at the computer all day on pretend adventures. You're finally on a real one, and you wanna go home? As a fan of your potential, I'm very disappointed. Oh, come on! Everyone at home must be worried sick. So let 'em worry. Don't you wanna play with this amazing book? It grants wishes! What do you want? Hello? The magic book just asked for your biggest wish. Tim. Stop worrying. You don't have to hide it. I really like you, Tim. We should go to the movies. By the way, when are you bringing back my slippers? They've had enough rain. Now they want snow. Alright. Some snow would be great. Dorothy's gonna flip. The slippers! I - wanna go - home! Look at you! Scared of your little girlfiend. Shut it! They won't work. Did ya break 'em? - Serves you right. - Bite your tongue! How could they break? Aren't they magic? - I must be working them wrong. - Ah ha. You stay out of it. Dumb bunny. The Clown and the Bear acted on Urfin's orders. That's clear. But at least the book is useless without the slippers. True. There is that. Which makes me wonder, what he needs it for. What are we up against? Bronze Dorothy can thwart any army, but I'd still build up our defences, just in case. Your wise excellency! I have carried out the investigation you ordered. Get to the point, General. Was he found? Yes sir! Meaning no, sir. He's gone. Ruf Bilan is gone? Yo! Dorothy's been captured by the Ogre! Dorothy's been captured by the Ogre! What is that thing screaming about, up there? I just want to rip it in half! Stop it! We need to hurry. And we're stuck in this window. General. We're taking the balloons to the Ogre's castle. Sir! Yes sir! Then, the Ogre has managed to take Dorothy prisoner again, to get his hands on the slippers. And Urfin got his hands on King Gamma's book. Yes! Urfin, the Ogre, and Ruf Bilan. They all had it planned. They're working together. No. Maybe this? Come on! What am I doing wrong? Not working, huh? Are... you... part of the tribe? You know, these things break constantly. I've had to fix mine countless times. So, they can be fixed? Of course. I'll wheel 'em to the silver slipper repair shop nearby. - Give 'em to me! - That's awesome! They'll fix them in a jif... Sorry about that. Don't worry about it. So. Want my help? Yeah, yeah. Definately. Home. Sweet Home. You shouldn't have trusted him. What? No chance he'll bring them back. Why didn't you say that earlier? - You'll never catch him. - I will so! And I could've helped you, quite a lot. To get the slippers back? No. To get you back home. But I have to find the slippers. Don't worry yourself. They will go back with you, my boy. Yeah? That would be just great! Master! Master! Look what I got! The slippers! Now the book answers to us! Let's find a good location. Over there. Show me that swamp. Yes. That should work. Let's try. Just say 'go home.' Go home! Ha ha! You're so gullible. I'm the one that's going home. - The book is ours! It's ours! - Master! It's there. - Look! Goodbye! - Stop! I have the slippers! What... is going on? Where am I? Take me back! Pretty please! He has the Silver Slippers! He has the Silver Slippers! - He has the Silver Slippers! - He has the Silver Slippers! Your Lordship! Put these on. - Yes. - Your Lordship. - Woah! - Your Lordship. Come to the palace, Your Lordship. The palace? Just leave me alone. I can't help you. Hey! What're they up to? Yeah, there's a lot of snow alright. I agree. But how can I fix it? Why don't you untie me, then we can figure this out together. Hey! Stop! Not in the fire! Remember, human sacrifices are a thing of the far distant past! Help! Everyone, come quick! The Fairy of the Silver Slippers has been captured by the Ogre! Yes! She needs help. Brr! Some weather you got here. Carraci! The Ogre's captured Dorothy. Dorothy. Captured by who? Right. Who's this? - Yeah? - Can you really understand them? You need to tell them. I'm sorry, but I can't stop it snowing. The slippers were stolen. Dorothy's slippers got stolen? I took them from her... I mean, well... it just happened. - You took Dorothy's slippers? - But it was an accident! Carraci! He stole Dorothy's slippers. Hurry. Bring Dorothy and rescue the criminal. No, wait! I mean, rescue Dorothy and bring the criminal to her. Just follow me! We'll figure it out. At last! You're here. You're waiting for me? Wait a sec. Are you actually the book? Well, aren't you perceptive. The book. I found the book! I did it. I found the book. Well, your place is nice enough. But mine was better. Yes. Much better. I ruled Emerald City for a time. I was once the greatest wizard in all the kingdom. - He's a wizard! - He's a wizard! I am. I also have seen better times. In the past, great wizards, witches and fairies lived here, everywhere. Ah! The battles that there were. And I was always at the center of it! I was once the center of everything. I was loved universally. Hold on. Where are they? - Who? - The Bear and the Clown. Both of them still love me. I want them to be here for this. Now you're the master here. You have only to command it. Make it so! What do we need the fire for? We're not bothered by the cold. We can't even feel it! We need to keep a fire ready in case our master turns up. Nice and cozy. The master, huh? May the earth swallow us whole if he even remembers us. Give me your paw! Ah! C'mon! Hurry! Wake up please! Hurry up? You're the one who shut me off. - Right when stuff was getting good, too. - C'mon! Just tell me what's happening. - Dorothy's been captured by the Ogre. - Is Dorothy really a fairy? Of course, duh! And now you have the chance to free her from the Ogre's clutches, and become a hero. Hooray for Tim! Hey, look. I did it! Hooray for Tim. You still need to get out of the basket. - You could try... - All over it. Master! You see? I've not forgotten faithful lackeys. You like the place? Swanky, huh? And that is our book! In the flesh! Ohh. The book. - Your Lordship! - Your Lordship! - Your Lordship! - Your Lordship! D'you hear that? They're calling me lord. I'm the lord of this land now. - Drink this, Your Lordship. - Oh! What's that? It's called magical ale. It's delicious. You should join me. Will you have one? Alas, I cannot. Only the one who controls the Silver Slippers may drink it. Shame. So, here's to me! You clumsy freak! Not to worry. I'll get you another. - Forgive me master! Take off your glasses. - What? Shh. Take off your glasses. You took them off. What a pity. I hope the view doesn't hurt your eyes. The slippers! Book! Hey, listen! Send us all back, right now. D'you hear? Deceiving scum! Or I'll use the slippers to destroy you! You will? You better be a good shot! Look! She's here! There! There! There! Hum? Playtime's over. I cannot take the slippers, indeed. But neither can you insist I go back. So I would like to propose a deal. What kind of deal? I will provide undefeatable warriors, and you do need an army, yes? I'll get an army. I'll give you all that you've ever wanted if you give me the slippers, that is. But only after I take the Emerald City. Deal. Instruct me. Look! Yes. That. That way. - They went there. - No, they went here! Told ya! That was the wrong way. Why are you trespassing in our forest? Wait! Why are you backing away? Get a stick and crack his face! - You sure? - Do it! It worked! They're stunned! Total brain damage! Why'd he hit me like that? Why'd you hit me? It wasn't me. It was my magic wand? Did he just say that it was his magic wand? He must be a wizard? - Yeah. - That's different then. Yes. What're our instructions? I need to see the Ogre. Can you help? Hey! You striped golems. Did you hear him? Ogre! Get the lead out! But it's our lunch time. Who cares about your lunch! The Ogre has got this boys lovey-dovey captured! Are you kidding? Oh, wise empire. You like her, he's got her. Let's get this Ogre. So what do we do? Rescue the lovey-dovey. So, afterwards, pretend like you just saved her on the way to something else more important. - Like a TV interview. - Stop! That's enough. You know what? I'm not interested in your advice any more. Hey! Can you go any faster? What is taking you so long? Don't think too hard. Your brain'll pop. It's about time. Now I'll eat your Rook. Delicious! And that's checkmate! Well look here. Now you can eat failure! Listen to me. We have to find him. The plan didn't work! Hooray! Fabulous! It worked! And you thought it was super dull. - It's Tim? You're sure? - Who else could it be? Let's go! Fire! Fire! You see? He is a true knight. Huh. He raised quite a ruckus. - Where'd his power come from? - I told you. This is the land of Oz. You get sweet powers here. - Should we surrender? - No way! Make them work for it. While we have a little fun. - I will eat anyone who comes close! - Oh, terrible! Good times! - Did he leave? - He better not have. Alright. That's it. Let's surrender. It's a weeping shame, but fine. Hey! We surrender. Dorothy! Dorothy! Hooray hooray hooray! Dorothy's with us again! Hooray hooray hooray! We're happy as we've ever been! Where's Tim? Ah, who is Tim? So, you were never really captured? But we are happy to hear that a knight has captured your heart. A knight? Tim's nobody's knight. You monster! What did you do to our Dorothy? Take that! And that! Where is she? Where? Fiend! Answer me right now! Where is she? Answer me! What is your problem? Hey! She's here. See, she's just fine. Dorothy? You're free! You're free! Hooray! Hooray! I found the thief who stole your slippers. I did more than that. I made the Carraci bring him here. He's in the basket. Hey! He escaped! Yeah. I see that. I'm sure he's fine. He was smart enough to escape. I bet he's coming to save you now. Yeah? Well, he's late. He's useless, not late. I bet he was never planning to save me. Well, even so. We still need to locate him, right? Tim? Tim? Tim? That's Dorothy. Hold on. I'm coming to save you! Oh! Look at him. There he is. My hero. Stop! Stop already. Tim! Dorothy's safe. You don't need to save her. Where are you? Just come out. Umm. Maybe he'll listen to you, Dorothy. I don't need you to save me from anything. Yeah. He's some knight. Unbelievable. I risk my life to save her, and she... Tim! The slippers! They cannot fall into the wrong hands. Remember! You can't return home without them. No! What have I done. She'll never forgive me for this. Hello. Is your name Tim, by any chance? What? Not me. I'm no-one. I bet his name is Tim. It isn't. He told us it wasn't. Why would he lie? Just watch it, punk. Geez, sorry. I keep forgetting everyone can talk here. And if I couldn't talk, then it'd be fine to throw nuts at me? No. That's not what I meant. - I think we're done here. - Hey! Wait up. Again, I'm sorry. But do you know Dorothy? - The theory of the Silver Slippers? - Right. Of course I have. She saved all of us. Didn't you hear? Yeah, of course I've heard. 'Cos, she's... she's my close friend. Or my best. Yeah? Are you her boyfriend? Uhh... what? Tell me everything! Are you crazy? I'm not telling you anything. I see. You were lying through your teeth. I was not, squirrel. Dorothy's slippers are lost. Dorothy really lost her slippers? Well, not exactly. It's my fault. I gave them away. Accidentally. It's complicated. Well, that was a good move. Come on. With me. Queen Ramina needs to hear this right away! Good idea. Queens know way more than real people. Will she be able to tell us how to get home? Dorothy and I have to get back somehow. What a massive oak. Can the trees here also talk? The trees here are quiet. Unlike you, motor mouth. Go on, Grab it. Now put it in there. - Wow. - Your majesty. - What a queen! - Bow, you idiot! Well? What's the story? Dolt here, lost the Silver Slippers. Really, they were stolen. Earlier, you said you gave them away. Well, they were broken. He promised to fix them. But we still need to get home. Can you help? Blow this enchanted whistle three times, and you will return home. See, umm, we'd need one for each of us. But we've only got one. Well, then, thanks. But I can't leave Dorothy. What does that mean? He said you did this. That you made the bad wizard snow on their little parade. Now you'll pay for what you did. Hey, you. Get over here. Show these goons what you can do. Scarecrow. I think that I see Tim. Tim! Stop where you are. We're coming down. Her? Back here? How could that be? Go and get that girl! Charge! Dorothy! Don't come down here! Up! Up! Go back up! Retreat! I want her alive. So hold your fire! Tim. Just jump! Tim! What? Where am I? You are special guest. Yes. Our guest. You're our guest. Scared? Don't be. Here. Put these on. You're tired. Lie down. Have a yummy little rest. I'm tired? Oh yes! So tired. Tim! Tim! Hey, your majesty. Tim. There's little time. Get out of there. How come? You're tired. Don't listen to her. I'm all good here. Just chillaxin'. Tim. You are on the path of a real knight. But Dorothy is still in danger. Speed to the Emerald City The Iron Statue, she will help you get there. Stay, and help us... A real knight. A knight? I'm a knight. But... the talking mouse said something else. Dorothy's in danger! No! Glasses on. Wait! Wait! Stay! Wait! Stay! Tim. I thought you couldn't. But you saved me. You turned out to be the bravest. What will I tell your mom, Tim? I just can't believe you're really... Urfin! Urfin! Our iron Dorothy will utterly destroy your army! Call off the attack at once! Has your little fairy girl become a Tin Man herself? This ought to be good. Charge! Forward march! Ho! Wrong way. Get back! What's going on? Come on. Lift me up. Master? Your Lordship! Your Lordship! Your Lordship! It's me! I was the one who helped steal the book. - You must pardon me. - What? Give me your pardon, and your thanks. Chor! Shake him really hard. Wait! Wait! I have a plan to capture the Emerald City. Hey! Bilan. Cough it up. What's this plan? Open the Emeral Dam floodgates, and the city's under water. Not half bad. Look, Your Lordship. It's there. Getting close. Perfect. This could work. I'll beat that girl once and for all. Dorothy? We need to defend the city from Urfin. We await your advice. We need you so much. The Tin Man, me. Everyone here. Dorothy! Tim! Tim? Tim! He's alive! How about that. He escaped. Your... err... your wisdomness... I'm a little pressed for time. - Very good news. - What news? Scarecrow! Tim is outside! Yes, I know that! - Tim! - Dorothy! Tim! You're too much. You had everyone so worried. I was running, and then my shoelace came untied. - And I... - And then I went flying. And I was, well... Everyone's glad you're here. Really glad you're here. - Tim! - Tim! Good to see you, lad. Give me a hug! Scarecrow! Urfin is heading to the dam. He plans to flood the city. Well, he must be stopped. - Tin Man? - General! Rally the troops. Where're you going? Stop! Urfin's not alone. There're monsters with him! Soon the city will be flooded! It's a catastrophe. 'The Iron Statue will help you'. Tim! Beautiful! Just look at it. They're done for this time. Now what is that? It's here, too. Hey! Why are you backing up? Are you scared? Don't make me call the book. Rip that thing to pieces! There he is! Get him! Get him! You dare to stand against me? Urfin Jus? The terrible and great? Last mistake you'll ever make. Take him out! Let me go! Come on... Goodbye. Hold your fire. What's that? Whatever you do, do not press the cross. If you ever, put me in sleep mode, ever again, you'll be so sorry! Doh! Where's Tim? Look! He's flying! Yes, he is. Well, fluff my puff! Is it really you? The awesome Urfin Jus? Rams salute! We welcome you master. Your great and terribleness! Here. Look. Wait a quick tic. I think you remind me of someone. Well, I am the leader of Oz. Oh please. You're not the leader of Oz. Nope. Nope. Nope. You're the leader of the entire galaxy! The greatest leader that ever lived! ? What ? ? A wonderful surprise ? ? I can't believe my eyes ? You shouldn't believe. He doesn't look powerful. Listen, I'm telling you. He's the boss of the universe. Clearly, you're the idiot of the universe. You're gonna argue with me? Stop! I've got evidence. Prophecy says the leader of the universe must have pink feet. Your feet are pink, right? What? You mean, are my feet pink? Yeah, duh. C'mon man, show us your feet. Yeah. They're very pink. Sure, sure. Both are. You hear that? You convinced? What? I'm super not convinced. Show us your feet. Whip 'em out. Hey! Do you mind? I want to see. Catch that boy! Ah ha! Ha! Urfin Jus the lame and gullible! Get your stinky feet out of here. Hey, stop! I... I wouldn't do it. That's my best friend in the world. Back off. Listen. Umm... thanks very much. You're full of surprises. Come on Tim. It was you who programmed me to be your second self. I'm only acting like you would. Turns out I'm pretty good at it. Almost as good as I am at being right, everytime. Tim! Tim! Scarecrow! Tin Man! Yep. I always said the Ogre was a really good guy. Everyone makes mistakes. But very few know how to correct them. Well done. Thanks, Tim. Lion! - Toto? Where are you, Toto? - Guess it's time. Alright. That's enough. Yes. But there are two of us. Not a problem. Tim will take you in his arms. Tim. Go on. Goodbye! Goodbye! Oh! My rooms a mess. I'll help clean up. Dorothy! I have cookies. D'you and that boy want some? Thanks granny. We do. You want cookies, right?
