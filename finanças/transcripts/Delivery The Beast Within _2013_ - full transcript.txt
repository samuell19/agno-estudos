HERE WE GO. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THEY GAVE ME THIS LITTLE CAMERA TO DO A LITTLE MINI CONFESSIONAL BY MYSELF, SO I CAN TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCTION. AND NOW THERE'S LOUD HELICOPTERS. UM, I HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN. OKAY. IT'S GOT THESE, LIKE, TALL, POINTY ROOF, SO IT REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE A STORYBOOK. WE REALLY ARE LIKE THE STEREOTYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY. HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL KEEP GOING... GOING GOOD. I HAD A BUDDY OF MINE WHO WAS CASTING DIRECTOR, AND HE HAD HIS OWN PROJECT GOING ON OF PEOPLE WHO WERE HAVING TROUBLE CONCEIVING THEIR FIRST CHILD, AND HE SENT ME THIS AUDITION TAPE ON KYLE AND RACHEL. TALKED TO SOME PEOPLE AT THE NETWORK. I SHOWED 'EM THE TAPE. THEY LOVED IT. THEY LOVED THE IDEA, AND... YOU KNOW, WE WERE SHOOTING IN A FEW WEEKS. LAPD IS REPORTING THAT. I JUST TALKED TO THEM. THEY SAID THERE'S NOTHING. YOU KNOW, RACHEL AND KYLE WERE LIKE FAMILY TO ME. YOU DON'T SPEND THAT LENGTH OF TIME IN THAT KIND OF AN INTIMATE OF A SETTING WITH PEOPLE AND NOT FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PART OF THE FAMILY. I'M HERE TO TELL THE WHOLE STORY. I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THE WHOLE STORY SO THEY CAN, YOU KNOW, KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I FEEL LIKE I OWE THEM THAT MUCH. HELLO, LITTLE BABY. DO I THINK SOMETHING HAUNTED RACHEL DURING HER PREGNANCY? YES. THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING LIKE EXPERIENCING YOUR FIRST PREGNANCY. FROM MORNING SICKNESS AND ACHY BACKS... TO FEELING YOUR BABY KICK FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD FOR US, JUST GETTING TO THIS POINT. AND THERE'S SURE TO BE PLENTY OF ADVENTURES AHEAD. BUT WE'RE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE. BECAUSE EVERY CHILD IS A BLESSING, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S YOUR FIRST. HEY, BUDDY. YOU GONNA GIVE HIM A HUG? RIGHT NOW SHE'S DEALING WITH THE WHOLE MORNING SICKNESS THING, SO THAT'S TOUGH. HOW YOU DOING? HM... YEAH, FOOD IS NOT MY FRIEND RIGHT NOW. - CAN YOU WASH THIS? - WANT MORE? - MM-MM. - FOR ME? EVERYTHING TASTES KIND OF WEIRD AND... AND I FEEL BAD 'CAUSE I CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP. IT'S PART OF THE, UH... THE... THE JOY OF MOTHERHOOD. WELL, I FEEL BAD. YOU GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF? I'LL BE FINE. THEY SAY IT GETS BETTER, SO... AND I EAT FOR THE BOTH OF US, SO THAT'S ME DOING MY PART. CALL ME LATER. OKAY. BYE, MADDIE. SAY, "BYE." IT'S RUDE. WE MET SOPHOMORE YEAR IN COLLEGE, IN CLASS. UM, AND IT'S FUNNY. I DIDN'T THINK THAT HE LIKED ME BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS ARGUING WITH ME LIKE WE WERE ROOMMATES. IT WAS DEBATE CLASS. YOU LIKED HAVING THE ANSWERS. I LIKED BEING RIGHT. I THINK YOU JUST LIKED PUSHING MY BUTTONS. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. SO WE DATED THROUGHOUT COLLEGE, SORT OF OFF AND ON. MORE ON THAN OFF. YEAH, BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT I WASN'T GONNA LET THIS ONE GET AWAY, SO I, UH... I LOCKED HER UP. UM, WE MARRIED IN 2006, AND NOT THAT LONG AFTER WE STARTED TRYING TO HAVE A BABY. RIGHT NOW, I AM WORKING IN A FILM LAB IN BURBANK. IT'S A TEMP JOB. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE FOR TWO MONTHS AND I HAVE BEEN THERE FOR, LIKE, SIX MONTHS, WHICH IS NICE. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THE RELIABILITY. I WORK AT AN INSURANCE COMPANY. I AM AN ACCOUNT MANAGER IN SALES. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T GROW UP THINKING I WANTED TO BE IN INSURANCE... NO ONE DOES... BUT, YOU KNOW, I CAN SEE MYSELF BEING THERE FOR A WHILE. THE DOCTOR TOLD US TO COME IN AT THE TEN-WEEK MARK, AND WE WERE REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE IT MEANT WE GET TO HEAR THE HEARTBEAT. YOU KNOW, WE HAD A COUPLE FALSE STARTS. I LIKE TO CALL THEM FALSE STARTS. UM, WE LOST A PREGNANCY. YOU KNOW, AND THEN YOU START TO WONDER IF YOU CAN EVER GET PREGNANT, BUT... I HAVE KNOWN RACHEL FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW. SHE CAME TO ME PRIVATELY JUST FOR GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES, AND TO SEE THEM AT THIS POINT AND DOING SO WELL IS REALLY EXCITING 'CAUSE I CAN TELL THEY'RE A COUPLE THAT JUST REALLY... YOU KNOW, THEY REALLY WANT TO BE PARENTS. WE CAN GO AND HAVE A LISTEN TO YOUR BABY IF YOU WANT. READY TO DO THAT? - LET'S DO IT. - YES. SIT BACK AND RELAX. THANK YOU. YAY, I AM... OOH. OH. HEY. YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF THE METAL. CAN YOU GET IT OUT? I FORGOT I HAD THIS. JUST TUCK THAT IN THERE, IF THAT'S OKAY. KNOW HOW TO GET... LIKE THAT? ALL RIGHT. IS THAT COMFORTABLE? MM-HMM. JUST RELAX. MAKE SURE THIS IS... WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE SEX, SO... WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL THE SEX TODAY. WE'RE JUST GETTING SOME SOUNDS. NOTHING ON THE SCREEN? NO, JUST SOUNDS. WE DECIDED THAT WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE SEX OF THE BABY. NO. SHOULD BE A SURPRISE. YEAH. SO WHEN IT COMES OUT, IT WILL JUST BE SORT OF, "OH, THAT'S THE PART YOU GOT." MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE EXCITING. JUST A LITTLE. THAT'S GONNA BE COLD, HUH? IT WILL BE COLD. YEAH. THIS IS THE COLD PART. OHH, THAT IS COLD. NOT TOO BAD. THAT'S THE COLD. IT'S NOT TOO BAD. LET'S SEE. WE'LL FIND IT IN JUST A SECOND. LET'S TRY OVER HERE. OKAY. THERE IT IS. CAN YOU HEAR THAT? - THAT'S IT? - YEAH, THAT'S INTENSE. CAN YOU HEAR THAT? - YEAH. - OH, MY GOD. RIGHT? IS IT GOOD? THAT'S AMAZING. OH, IT'S A STRONG... THAT IS A STRONG HEARTBEAT. THAT'S HEALTHY? THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? - OH, THAT'S FINE. - OKAY. HEARING THE HEARTBEAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS, UM... IT'S AMAZING. UM, I... IT'S REAL, YOU KNOW? YES, YES. IT'S LIKE, THIS IS HAPPENING. YEAH. LOUD. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HIT THIS MILESTONE, SO THAT'S... BUT SCARY LOUD. THERE'S A MONSTER IN THERE OR SOMETHING. SHE IS RIGHT AT ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS, SO AT THIS POINT, ACTUALLY, IT'S PROBABLY THE... MORE THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE PREGNANCY. THE REAL IMPACT IS IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER, WHEN THE DISCOMFORT STARTS. YOU KNOW, IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE REACHED THIS MILESTONE, SO WE CAN ACTUALLY START TELLING PEOPLE... - YEAH. - AND THAT'S PRETTY COOL. TODAY WE'RE GONNA MEET UP WITH MY MOM, 'CAUSE SHE'S IN TOWN, AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA TELL HER THE GOOD NEWS. SHE'S GONNA READ YOU LIKE A BOOK. SHE'S GONNA SEE YOU ACROSS THE STREET. SHE'S GONNA SAY, "OH, MY GOD!" WE ALSO HAD SOMETHING WE WANTED TO TELL YOU. THIS SHOW THAT WE'RE DOING, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT... IT'S NOT ABOUT COUPLES WHO ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE. IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT COUPLES WHO ARE PREGNANT. WE'RE PREGNANT. THERE WE GO. OH, THAT IS SO GREAT! OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD, I'VE BEEN... I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR THIS. I JUST COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED. SO WHEN? - OCTOBER. - MM-HMM. OCTOBER 20TH. DID YOU KNOW? DID YOU SENSE IT? DID YOU FEEL IT? I WAS... I THOUGHT THAT THE SIGNS WERE POINTING TOWARD IT. OH, I WISH YOUR DAD COULD BE HERE. OH, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY. I'M SURE HE'S UP THERE SOMEWHERE. NOW, KYLE? YES? THIS IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY. "YOU KNOW, KYLE, THIS IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY." SHE MEANS WELL. THANK YOU, YEAH. KYLE IS YOUNG FOR HIS AGE. WE APPRECIATE HIS JOY OF LIVING, BUT THIS IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY. THIS IS A BIG DEAL. I'M EXCITED. YOU'LL BE A GOOD DAD. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT'S...-I'M READY. I'M READY. I'M NOT WORRIED. WE'RE A LUCKY FAMILY. WE ARE VERY BLESSED. GOD IS GOOD. NICE PLACE, PRETTY GOOD. YEAH. MINE WAS DELICIOUS. THANK YOU. MY FRIEND JENNY, WE WERE ASKING HER, LIKE, WHERE WOULD A COOL PLACE TO GO, YOU KNOW, JUST SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN... AND WHAT WOULD BARBARA LIKE? THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY THOUGHT. WHAT... WHERE WOULD BARBARA FEEL COMFORTABLE? SO... SO YOU BRING ME TO A PLACE WHERE THE WAITER HAS FANGS. OH, MY GOD. BUT THE SKELETON MASK, YEAH. I SEE WHAT YOU REALLY THINK, KYLE. NO. BARBARA AND I GET ALONG FINE. I MEAN, WE DO. SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH I CARE FOR RACHEL. THERE ARE JUST DIFFERENCES, YOU KNOW? I JUST THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY SHE WISHES I WAS... CATHOLIC? YEAH. YEAH. I FOUGHT TO KEEP THE SHOW VERY REAL, VERSUS SOMETHING SCRIPTED. THIS COULD MAKE A NETWORK, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PREDICT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. THEY LIKE A LOT OF CONTROL ON THEIR SETS. $680. CAN'T YOU JUST CARRY THE BABY? YOU KNOW, AS IT TURNS OUT, WE CAPTURED A VERY DRAMATIC AND PRETTY SCARY MOMENT FOR OUR PILOT EPISODE. ABOUT A WEEK AGO WE WERE JUST HAVING LUNCH, LIKE WE USUALLY DO... - YEAH. - AND I WALK IN AND SHE JUST... SHE JUST LOOKS AT ME FUNNY. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP. AND SO SHE JUST ASKS ME OUTRIGHT. YOU HAD, LIKE, THIS GLOW. OF COURSE, WE NEEDED TO THROW A PARTY AND... NOBODY KNOWS YET. NO ONE KNOWS YET, BUT THEY'RE ABOUT TO. ACTUALLY, GUYS, I-I-I NEED YOUR ATTENTION. WOW. YOU HAVE IT. I HAVE IT! OKAY. I WILL COMMAND. UM, ACTUALLY, WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE... I NEED TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT. OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU PREGGERS? YOU DON'T LOOK PREGNANT. YOU DON'T LOOK PREGNANT. I WAS JUST SAYING YOU HAD AN ANNOUNCEMENT. AND I'VE GOT A BEER IN MY HAND AS WELL, KEVIN. VERY NICE. UM, WE ARE CELEBRATING A PREGNANCY BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE HERE IN THIS ROOM IS PREGNANT. GUESS WHO IS IT. - SHE KNOWS! - SHE KNOWS! THEY KNOW IT'S NOT YOU. PROCESS OF ELIMINATION! OH, MY GOD! RACHEL AND KYLE ARE HAVING A BABY! OUR FRIENDS KNOW HOW HARD IT'S BEEN FOR US TRYING, SO IT WAS JUST... IT WAS GREAT TO FINALLY GET TO SHARE THIS NEWS WITH THEM. HAVE A LITTLE DONUT ON THE WAY. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. I'M SORRY. - HE SAID... - OH, COME ON. I THINK WE SHOULD ALL TOAST. SO, A TOAST. TO A HAPPY FAMILY THAT'S ON ITS WAY. YAY. I KNOW HOW HARD YOU GUYS HAVE WORKED, SO THIS IS GREAT NEWS. - YOU KNOW, IT'S... - NOT THAT HARD. I'M THE FIRST OF MY FRIENDS WHO'S GONNA HAVE A BABY. I WAS THE FIRST TO GET MARRIED, SO I KNEW THAT I WAS GONNA GET IT FROM ALL SIDES. IT'S GONNA BE YOU GUYS NEXT. NO, I HOPE... YOU KNOW, AND I HOPE THAT... I DON'T WANT THIS TO CHANGE ANYTHING. I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S GONNA CHANGE THINGS, BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO, LIKE, CHANGE HOW MUCH I SEE YOU GUYS, AND... LATER ON, RACHEL WASN'T FEELING WELL SO SHE WENT TO LAY DOWN... AND THEN WHEN WE GOT HOME SHE STARTED FEELING WORSE. BABY? OH, MY GOD, BABY. BABY, BABY, BABY. YOU OKAY? OKAY, IT'S OKAY. OKAY, OKAY, IT'S OKAY. STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR, I REMEMBER THINKING, "NOT AGAIN," JUST REMEMBERING HOW HARD IT WAS ON HER THE LAST TIME. SHH. WHEN WE GOT TO THE HOSPITAL, THEY TOOK HER IN RIGHT AWAY. THE DOCTOR SAW HER, AND WE SORT OF KNEW THE SITUATION 'CAUSE WE'D BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE. UM, THE HARDEST PART REALLY IS... IS THE WAIT, YOU KNOW? ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW HOW IT'S GONNA TURN OUT. I'M SORRY, SIR. THE DOCTOR TOLD US THAT WE HAD TWO OPTIONS. WE COULD LET THE MISCARRIAGE RUN ITS COURSE, UM, OR WE COULD HAVE A PROCEDURE TO SPEED THINGS ALONG, AND, UH, I TOLD RACHEL THAT I'D SUPPORT HER EITHER WAY. CAN YOU SEE IF THEY CAN GIVE ME SOMETHING TO SLEEP? YEAH. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. ALL RIGHT? I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO. I'M SORRY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OKAY. HE GAVE US THE OPTION OF DOING A PROCEDURE THAT WOULD SPEED IT ALONG, UM, BUT I DON'T... FOR ME, IT DIDN'T REALLY FEEL RIGHT. YOU KNOW? THIS IS THE FURTHEST WE'D COME ALONG AND IT... I JUST FELT LIKE YOU NEED TO JUST LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE AND, UM... AND SO WE DECIDED NOT TO DO IT. IN THE MORNING, I WOKE UP AND FOR SOME REASON, I JUST NEEDED THEM TO DO ANOTHER ULTRASOUND. RIGHT THIS WAY, PLEASE. NO CAMERAS. WE'VE RUN ALL THE TESTS WE NEED TO AND WE LOOKED OVER EVERYTHING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS, BECAUSE WE FOUND A HEARTBEAT. YOU'RE SURE? YEAH. YOUR BABY'S ALIVE AND WELL. THANK YOU. YOU'RE GONNA BE PARENTS. OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELL, IT'S BEEN VERY EXHAUSTING AND STRESSFUL AND CONFUSING. THEY STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WE GOT A STRONG ONE. BUT WE STILL HAVE OUR BABY. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. OF ALL PREGNANCIES, ABOUT 20% ROUGHLY WIND UP IN MISCARRIAGE. MISDIAGNOSIS IS RARE, BUT IN THIS CASE, EVERYTHING TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THEIR BABY. IT'S GOOD. I LOVE YOU. THAT NIGHT OF THE HOSPITAL... I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, BUT THERE WAS SOMEONE IN THE ROOM WITH ME. NOT KYLE. SOMEONE ELSE. I THINK THAT, IN HER MIND, IT WAS HER DAD. I THINK SHE THINKS HER DAD WAS THERE. IT... IT JUST MAKES ME REALIZE THAT I'M SURROUNDED BY MORE PEOPLE THAN I KNOW. OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO GO HOME. THAT NIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL IS WHEN I NOTICED THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE. WE HAD OUR FIRST EQUIPMENT ISSUES, AND THERE WAS THIS DEFINITE SHIFT IN WHAT WE WERE CAPTURING, NOT ONLY WITH THE TONE OF THE FOOTAGE BUT WITH RACHEL. WHY DON'T YOU JUST SET THOSE DOWN? I'LL TAKE CARE OF 'EM. YOU CAN LAY DOWN. OH, COME HERE. IT'S OKAY. I HATE THE HOSPITAL. I KNOW YOU DO. WELL, NO MORE, OKAY? AT LEAST FOR A WHILE. I'M GONNA GO SLEEP FOR A MILLION YEARS. YEAH. GOOD. OH, MADDEN. POOR BOY. HOW'S HE LOOK? - HEY. - HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON, BUDDY? OKAY, HEY. OKAY. I'M... YEAH, I'M DONE. HEY, COME HERE. WHAT'S THAT, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU OKAY? YEAH, YEAH. HEY, BUDDY. IT'S JUST US, HUH? YOU FEELING ALL COOPED UP IN THERE, HUH? LET'S GO FOR A WALK. WHAT DO YOU SAY? YEAH? EVER SINCE WE GOT BACK THAT NIGHT FROM THE HOSPITAL, THE DOG HAS BEEN ACTING KIND OF STRANGE. LIKE... I THINK HE'S CONFUSED BY EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON, SO HE'S ACTING OUT A LITTLE BIT. YEAH, TOWARDS ME. IT'S ALL DIRECTED AT ME. IT'S THE PILLOW. THE PILLOW WAS AN ACCIDENT. YEAH. LOOK WHAT YOUR DOG DID. IS THAT... THAT'S MINE, YUP. HE'S... HE'S NOT... IT'S AN ACCIDENT. HE'S NOT GOING AFTER YOUR PILLOW. ISN'T HE? WELL, HE'S... THERE ARE THESE PEOPLE AND THE CAMERAS AND HE'S JUST FIGURING IT ALL OUT. HE GETS SO DEFENSIVE WHEN I TALK ABOUT HIS DOG. I... WE'RE GONNA LOOK FOR A BIGGER PLACE, AND I THINK THAT'LL BE A GOOD SOLUTION FOR EVERYBODY. UH, SO I THINK A HOUSE IS WHAT WE NEED. I LIKE THE SORT OF OPEN FLOOR PLANS. I'M MORE FASCINATED BY, LIKE, WHAT THEY'VE USED TO DECORATE THE PLACE THAN THE ACTUAL HOUSE. BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS COULD BE YOUR MASTER RIGHT HERE. HOUSE HUNTING HAS BEEN A LOT MORE FRUSTRATING THAN I EXPECTED. NOT BAD, YOU KNOW? I REALLY WANT IT TO BE DONE. I WANT TO GET SETTLED, YOU KNOW, BY THE TIME THE BABY GETS HERE. I THINK I HAVE THAT NESTING INSTINCT, SO IT'S, UH... I'M GETTING VERY IMPATIENT. SORRY. OH, MY GOD. DON'T LOOK. THAT'S NOT GOOD. WHAT IS THIS BABY SO HAPPY ABOUT? WHY DON'T YOU USE THAT AS THE BABY'S ROOM? YEAH, WE'VE GOT NOTHING. RACHEL WANTS TO MAKE AN OFFER ON THE TRAP HOUSE. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. OKAY, WE'LL BE QUIET. YEAH. OH, I LIKE THESE ARCHES. YEAH. HECK YEAH. WE WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS ALL THE TIME. IT IS... THIS IS MUCH BIGGER. AS A REALITY SHOW PRODUCER, YOU LIVE FOR MOMENTS LIKE THIS. THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE SHOW. THESE UNPLANNED DRAMATIC MOMENTS. YOU WANT TO CAPTURE THESE THINGS. HEY, HEY, OKAY, MOM, MOM. I'M SORRY. MOM! YOU'RE JUST LIKE... YOU KNOW, "YOU GETTING THIS?" COME ON, LET'S JUST GO. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. HEY, WHAT THE... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, MOM! LADY... STOP, STOP, STOP. GO. DAVID, WHAT THE FUCK? THIS LADY OBVIOUSLY HAD IT OUT FOR RACHEL. STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP! OH, THAT WAS SO WEIRD. YEAH, SHE... SHE SAW MY BELLY AND, UH, SHE JUST STARTED FREAKING OUT. YOU KNOW, YELLING AND POINTING AT ME AND... WELL, IT'S A TOUGH TIME RIGHT NOW FOR PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES. IT WAS A LITTLE SCARY, ACTUALLY, BUT... I'M JUST GLAD SHE'S OKAY. THAT THEY'RE OKAY. MY EDITOR IS ARMENIAN AND HE SAID THAT THE LADY WAS YELLING... WAS SAYING "DEVIL." SHE WAS SAYING "DEVIL." THE MOVE INTO THE NEW HOUSE WORKED FOR EVERYONE. IT WORKED FOR THE SHOW. BUT THE LITTLE... UM, THE LITTLE INCIDENTS THAT STARTED HAPPENING, THEY JUST SEEMED TO GET WORSE. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? THIS IS THE BABY'S ROOM. YEAH? YEAH. I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST... FEELS THAT WAY? IT DEFINITELY FEELS THAT WAY. BECAUSE TWO CAMERAS IN OUR FACES AREN'T ENOUGH, YOU GUYS ARE INSTALLING SECURITY CAMERAS IN THE CORNERS OF OUR HOUSE, AND THAT WAY YOU CAN'T EVER GET AWAY. I GOT ONE UP HERE IN THE BABY'S ROOM. DON'T ASK ME WHY. THERE'S NO BABY. AND EVEN ONE... THIS IS THE BEST... IN OUR BEDROOM! SO THAT RICK CAN WATCH US AND JERK OFF. WE HAD MORE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ON THE SET OFDELIVERY THAN I'VE HAD ON ANY OF MY PREVIOUS SHOOTS AT ANY TIME. OOH. OOH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. FEEL, FEEL, FEEL, FEEL. NO, NO, NO, OVER HERE. IT'S VERY UNUSUAL THAT INTERFERENCE WOULD BE CONTAINED AROUND A PERSON OR AN AREA. WHAT WOULD THE MURAL BE OF? BUT THIS HAPPENED TO BE OCCURRING AROUND RACHEL. HELLO! HEY, SWEETHEART. HOW ARE YOU? OHH. WELL, MY MOM CAME TO VISIT, SO THAT WAS NICE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE'S SEEN THE NEW PLACE AND MY BABY BUMP. INTO THE BEDROOM. OOH, THAT'S A STEEP STAIRCASE. OH, I KNOW, YEAH. I JUST HAVE MY STUDIO UP THERE. YOU BE CAREFUL. THIS IS LIKE A... YEAH. LIKE A SHIP. WELL, I'M SO... I'M THRILLED. I THINK IT'S THE PERFECT LITTLE HOUSE FOR THE PERFECT LITTLE ANGEL. ALSO, THIS IS THE BABY'S ROOM. THE BABY'S ROOM. YEAH. YOU KNOW, KYLE'S BEEN WORKING SO MUCH AND I'M HERE BY MYSELF MOST OF THE TIME, SO THAT'LL BE NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY HERE. I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT PUTTING "AMANDA" ON THERE EARLIER AND I FORGOT ABOUT IT. HOW FUNNY. OF COURSE YOU SHOULD PROBABLY NOT TELL ANYONE THE NAME BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL KNOW SOMEONE THEY DON'T LIKE. OH, MOM, CHECK THIS OUT. WHO'S JEALOUS? RACHEL, DON'T DO THAT. WHAT? IT'S FUNNY. THAT'S MEAN. I DON'T KNOW. I-I... BIG DOG AROUND A LITTLE BABY? I THINK THE DOG IS FINE AND IF WE STOP PLAYING TRICKS WITH HIM, EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT. OKAY? DOG'S FINE. IT'S KIND OF A TOUCHY SUBJECT. OKAY. AH! HELLO. HELLO. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE READING A MAGAZINE. I DON'T WANT TO BE ON CAMERA. WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. - LET'S... - OKAY, THAT IS NOT WHAT THAT IS FOR. WHERE YOU GOING? I'M GONNA GO BE BLOATED OVER HERE. I'M TOO BIG TO BE RUNNING AWAY. MM. YOU'RE ONE HOT MAMA. FINE, STOP, STOP. WHAT? I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE IF YOU GIVE ME ONE SEXY SHOT OF THAT BUMP THERE. - THIS BUMP? - POSE FOR ME. HAPPY NOW? SO... WHAT THE... OH, MY GOD. OKAY, THAT WAS WEIRD. SO, THE FLIP CAMS WERE A GIFT TO KYLE AND RACHEL. I MADE THEM PROMISE ME THAT THEY WOULD SHOW ME THE FOOTAGE AND MAYBE WE WOULD, UH, USE THEM FOR, YOU KNOW, A SPECIAL FEATURE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, UH, BEHIND THE SCENES. IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER SHE DIED THAT ANYONE SAW HER VIDEOS. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT I SAW ON THOSE CAMERAS. THEY JUST WANT TO, LIKE, CATCH... THEY JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE, YOU'VE BEEN HEARING. WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. OH, WHY DON'T WE WANT... WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT? I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH... THAT'S NOT PART OF THE SHOW. WELL, KYLE'S BEEN WORKING REALLY LONG HOURS, AND, UM... I DON'T KNOW. LATELY I JUST... YOU KNOW, IT'S AN OLDER HOUSE AND IT CREAKS AND WHATNOT. LATELY I JUST GET REALLY SPOOKED EASILY, YOU KNOW? I-I HEAR A NOISE AND I THINK SOMEBODY'S THERE. SO THAT KEEPS ME UP FOR A WHILE, AND THEN WHEN I FINALLY DO GET TO SLEEP I END UP HAVING REALLY AWFUL NIGHTMARES. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN PAINTING MORE, SO THAT'S GOOD. WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE PREGNANCY OR THAT SHE'S JUST COMMITTING MORE TIME TO IT, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S INTERESTING, HER NEW STUFF. I DO OIL PAINTING AND SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL IT'S DRY, AND THEN YOU VARNISH IT, SO THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE VARNISH TO DRY, SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING, LIKE, WHAT IS THIS MANNEQUIN? THIS HERE IS MARLENA. SHE'S BEEN... I'VE HAD HER FOR A LONG TIME. UH, YOU KNOW, IT'S... I'M NOT GONNA GET A MODEL TO... SIT HERE, ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, TO BE MY MODEL, SO SHE'S REALLY GOOD IF I WANT TO DO FIGURE DRAWING STUFF. IT'S WEIRD 'CAUSE IT'S NOT USUALLY THE KIND OF THING THAT I PAINT. I'M JUST REALLY FOCUSED ON EYES AND BEING WATCHED. YOU KNOW? I MEAN, LIKE, THIS CHARACTER ALMOST LOOKS AFRAID, AND THIS ONE, IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST STARING BACK AT ME. I WAS UP LATE PAINTING, LIKE USUAL, UM, AND I GOT REALLY TIRED ALL OF A SUDDEN, SO I WENT DOWNSTAIRS, UM, AND IT WAS REALLY DARK, AND I-I JUST LEFT IT, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE UP KYLE. UM, SO I CRAWL INTO BED... AND I'M ABOUT TO FALL ASLEEP, AND THEN HE REACHES FOR ME... BUT IT'S NOT KYLE. UH, I CAN ONLY SEE HIS HAND. IT'S SO DARK I CAN'T SEE HIS FACE, AND HE HAS NAILS. THEY'RE LIKE... THEY'RE LIKE RAZORS, AND HE REACHES FOR MY BELLY. THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD, AND I CAN'T MOVE AT ALL, AND I CAN'T YELL. IT'S JUST... I TRY AND I TRY AND I... NOTHING COMES OUT. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S... AND THEN I WAKE UP, AND THEN I DON'T WANT TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN, SO I GO BACK UPSTAIRS TO PAINT. WHAT? IT WAS JUST A... NIGHTMARE. IT'S NOT PICKLES AND ICE CREAM WITH HER. SHE HAS THIS CRAVING FOR MEAT... WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE SHE... SWORE OFF IT YEARS AGO. HM. IT'S... STOP. IT'S NOT HEALTHY. I'M NOT KIDDING. - IT'S FINE. - I CAN'T EAT THIS. I'M NOT PREGNANT. - NO, NO, NO, I LIKE IT RARE. - RACHEL... IT TASTES WEIRD WHEN IT'S ALL COOKED. - IT'S FINE. - THAT'S... SEE? ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT THE RESERVATIONS I HAD ABOUT HAVING A HOME BIRTH WITH A MIDWIFE... IN THIS CASE, UM, WITH THE MASSYS... IS JUST MY CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE CHILD AND THE MOTHER. THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA DO IN THIS APPOINTMENT. CERTAINLY I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT HAD RACHEL STAYED IN MY CARE THROUGHOUT HER PREGNANCY THAT WE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT SOME TYPE OF PRECLUDE TO IT THAT WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED. WHAT ARE YOU SCRATCHING AT OVER THERE? OH, I WAS... I HAD THIS BRACELET. - IT GAVE ME A RASH. - HM. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK I WAS JUST ALLERGIC TO IT OR SOMETHING. NOW, ISN'T THAT MUCH NICER THAN HAVING TO GO OUT AND GO INTO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE? YES. AT THIS POINT, I JUST FEEL VERY BADLY FOR BOTH FAMILIES. JUST GET A RECORD OF IT. GET SHOTS OF ALL THE MIRRORS. OKAY. OH, MY GOD. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. WE'RE HERE A MONTH, SOMEBODY BREAKS IN. I KNOW I LOCKED THE DOOR. - I WOULDN'T FORGET THAT. - DON'T... DON'T TOUCH IT. - I LOCKED... - DON'T TOUCH IT. JUST WAIT FOR THE POLICE. - OH, MY GOD. - GET THIS. WHAT IS IT? GOD, WHAT IS THAT SMELL? GET THIS. OH, MY GOD. YOU KNOW, IF WE LEFT MADDEN IN THE HOUSE... OH, DON'T START. WHAT? FWHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THAT? IT'S JUST A PRANK. WHY US? OH, MY GOD. LET'S GET OUT, LET'S GET OUT. HURRY. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. DON'T, DON'T. DON'T GO UP THERE. KYLE! GREAT. KYLE? KYLE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? KYLE? IT'S NOBODY. IT'S NOBODY. IT'S NOTHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO. EXCEPT LEAVE MADDEN IN THE HOUSE. I TOLD YOU. WE'LL JUST WAIT FOR THE POLICE TO COME. KYLE? WHAT? HOW DO WE... HOW DO WE SEE WHAT'S ON 'EM? WE COULD PROBABLY JUST CALL RICK. NEIGHBORS DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY. NOTHING WAS MISSING, AND AT 11:17, ALL THE CAMERAS WENT OUT. AND IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST TIME THAT WE CAUGHT THE VOICE ON THE TRACK. RACHEL SENT ME A NUMBER OF THE EVPs RECORDED BY THE PRODUCTION TEAM. EVPs BEING "ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENON." PEOPLE BELIEVE THEM TO BE RECORDINGS OF THE DEAD. GEOFF BURROUGHS IS SOMEONE THAT RACHEL REACHED OUT TO AFTER SHE HEARD THE RECORDINGS. HE'S A PARANORMAL RESEARCHER, RADIO HOST GUY. YOU KNOW, GEOFF IS OUT FOR GEOFF, AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT THERE WAS A SHOW INVOLVED HE BECAME MUCH MORE INTERESTED. WELL, THE TRIANGLES DRAWN ON THE MIRRORS THAT RACHEL HAD MENTIONED, THAT CERTAINLY RAISED MY ANTENNA. THE THAUMATURGIC TRIANGLE IS SAID TO SUMMON DEMONS. YOU KNOW, KYLE DIDN'T TRUST HIM. YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT IN OVER A WEEK. SURPRISED YOU'RE HEARING VOICES ON ONE OF THOSE MICS? HAVE YOU LISTENED TO IT? YEAH, I HAVE. IT'S GIBBERISH. PROBABLY INTERFERENCE FROM A CORDLESS PHONE OR SOMETHING. CAN I GET A MIC CHECK? HI, THIS IS KYLE. KYLE'S MIC. I'M JUST SAYING, I'M HOME BY MYSELF AND THEN THE DOG'S GROWLING AT ME FOR NO REASON? I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MADDEN. - NOW THEY'RE PICKING UP... - I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT MADDEN. CREEPY SHIT ON MY MICROPHONE. I MEAN... I'M ONLY ASKING. MAYBE I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, AND... WHAT DO YOU... WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT? HONESTLY, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT? OKAY? ARE WE READY? NO, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. NO, IT'S... YEAH, IT'S FINE. OKAY. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? THIS FUCKING MICROPHONE? IT WILL PICK UP WATER NOISE. OKAY? SOMEBODY ELSE PICKS UP THE SAME GODDAMN THING IN THEIR OLD FUCKING HOUSE AND THEY PUT IT ON THE INTERNET. THE SAME EXACT NOISES? NOISES! NOISES! IT'S NOT GHOSTS, RACHEL! RACHEL HAD BECOME OBSESSED, FOR A LACK OF A BETTER TERM, WITH THE NAME ALASTOR, THE ENTITY OF ALASTOR. IN THE CATHOLIC FAITH, ALASTOR IS A DEMON OF REVENGE, BASICALLY. IF THE DEMON ALASTOR HAD BECOME OBSESSED WITH RACHEL AND IN FACT POSSESSED HER, UH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION. THERE WAS NOTH... NOTHING, ESSENTIALLY NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO REMOVE THE DEMON UNTIL IT GOT WHAT IT WANTED... AND RACHEL BELIEVED WHAT ALASTOR WANTED WAS TO BE REBORN THROUGH HER CHILD. I LOVE HOW THE... I LOVE HOW THE PERSON WHO CAME FORWARD CAME FORWARD ANONYMOUSLY. COWARD. I WOULD NEVER STOOP TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MY TRACK RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. I DON'T NEED... I DON'T NEED TRICKS. NO, I DON'T ADMIT NOTHING. I HAVE GREAT SHOWS. THEY'RE GREAT SHOWS BECAUSE WE DO THINGS RIGHT. JUST LEAVE IT OUT, AND I'LL EAT WHEN I GET HOME. OH, OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE FOLLOWING YOU. YES, THEY'RE FOLLOWING ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING, BUT IT'S GOING TO GET ME IN TROUBLE. - COME ON. - TROUBLE? - LOOK... - WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE? LOOK, LOOK, JUST TELL 'EM. JUST TELL 'EM. TROUBLE, THIS GUY'S TROUBLE. JUST TELL THEM TO TURN THE CAMERAS OFF. - IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. - YEAH, I'VE TRIED. HEY, GUYS, TURN THE CAMERAS OFF. - FELLAS... - GO FUCK YOURSELVES. OKAY. - SHOTS. - SHOTS? - SHOTS. - SHOTS. YOU NEED A SHOT. I CAN TELL YOU NEED A SHOT. - I ALREADY DID... - HE DOES NEED A SHOT. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM TO DO A SHOT SINCE I GOT HERE. MASSY, MASSY... MASSY! SHUT YOUR MOUTH! I REALLY NEED THE HOURS, BUILD UP GOODWILL. I SH... I SHOULD HAVE CALLED. I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW. I'M... I'M, LIKE... I'M BY MYSELF. - I... - YOU LEAVE ME WITH THIS FREAKING DOG. IS HE IN HERE? YEAH. YOU CAN'T LEAVE HIM... I CAN'T DEAL WITH HIM. HEY, BUDDY. OH, NOW HE'S... OH, LOOK HOW SWEET HE IS. HE'S YOUR LITTLE BABY. IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. I WOKE UP THE OTHER DAY AND HE WAS JUST STARING AT ME. RACHEL, MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T ANTAGONIZE HIM ALL THE TIME, HE'D BE OKAY. I'M NOT ANTAGONIZING HIM. HE'S FINE NOW. HE'S FINE WHEN HE'S WITH YOU. I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT THE DOG. I-I DON'T WANT THE DOG IN THE HOUSE ANYMORE. HE MAKES ME REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. - YOUR FUCKING MOTHER, OKAY? - OHH! I KNEW THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN. - SHE'S GONNA PLANT SOME... - OH, IT'S MY MOTHER. - THAT'S RIGHT. - GODDAMN IDEA IN YOUR HEAD, AND YOU'RE GONNA RUN WITH IT, RACHEL. I KNEW THAT THIS WAS GONNA FUCKING HAPPEN! THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY MOTHER. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. I SEE IT HAPPENING ALL THE TIME! THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. SHE TELLS YOU WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO AND YOU DO IT. THAT DOG IS BARKING AND GROWLING AT ME ALL THE TIME. IT'S PISSING ON MY PILLOW. RACHEL, I SWEAR TO GOD, THIS IS IN YOUR HEAD, OKAY? THIS IS IN YOUR HEAD. IT PISSED ON YOUR PILLOW. IT PISSED ON YOUR PILLOW, OKAY? IT COULD HAVE BEEN MY PILLOW. IT WAS A FUCKING... BUT IT WASN'T! YOU ACT LIKE NONE OF THIS MATTERS. - YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT... - I'M NOT GONNA PLAY THIS GAME. ABOUT HOW I'M FEELING. I AM NOT GONNA HUMOR YOU AND PRETEND THAT THE DOG HAS SOME VENDETTA AGAINST YOU, OKAY? I'M NOT GONNA DO IT. IT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS. OH, NOW I'M CRAZY BECAUSE THE DOG... - RACHEL! - THE DOG DOESN'T LIKE ME. IT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS, OKAY? IT'S LIKE YOU'VE... YOU CARE MORE ABOUT THAT... - WHAT? - I FEEL LIKE YOU CARE MORE ABOUT THAT DOG THAN YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR BABY. FUCK THAT. OH, YEAH, JUST GO. WAY TO BE A FATHER! I'M GOING FOR A WALK. OH, YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. EVERY TIME THERE'S AN ISSUE, WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE? THAT'S FUCKING RESPONSIBLE! MAN UP! JESUS. FUCK, GET OUT. I DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT THE DRINKS. I MEAN, I COULD HAVE CALLED. I MEAN, ONE NIGHT OUT OF... IT'S... IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. YOU KNOW, SHE SAYS THAT I'M NOT COMMITTED ENOUGH TO THE PREGNANCY. WHAT AM I WORKING 12-HOUR DAYS FOR? MAYBE I GOT TO DO MORE. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SHE NEEDS MORE OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. LET'S GO INSIDE. MADDEN. MADDEN, IT'S OKAY. YEAH. UM, SO, THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH, JUST SO YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. THERE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT HER NEWEST STUFF. IT WAS... THIS IS A GREAT SPACE. DARKER. DIFFERENT. IT'S MORE BOLD. HER NEWER WORK, IT SEEMED MORE TROUBLED. YEAH, THEY ALMOST LOOK LIKE SCRATCHES IN A WAY. I JUST KNEW SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT AND IT WAS REFLECTED IN HER WORK. I'M CURRENTLY CLEANING MY BRUSHES BECAUSE THE WEIRDEST THING ABOUT INSOMNIA IS THAT EVENTUALLY YOU DO GET TIRED AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO BED, BUT I'VE BEEN PAINTING, SO I'VE BEEN, UH... SORRY, UM, WHAT WAS I SAYING? OH, YEAH. AND, UH, YEAH. I'M JUST... THERE'S SOMETHING THERE. HMM? OKAY. I THINK I'M JUST TIRED AND HEARING THINGS, SO... RACHEL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? UH, I WAS JUST CLEANING OUT MY BRUSHES. IT'S LATE, COME ON. MOVE. SHIT. OH, JESUS. - WHOA, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. - DAMN IT. STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP. - NO, NO, NO, NO, STOP. - HONEY, GET READY FOR WORK. STOP. HEY! EASY. JUST GET BACK. JUST GET BACK. GO SIT DOWN. GO SIT DOWN. ARE YOU DONE IN THE BATHROOM? - YEAH. - WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW. SOMEBODY KEEPS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR, SO I DECIDED THAT I'M GOING TO CATCH THEM... EVENTUALLY. OKAY. THIS IS DUMB. SEE? THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. NOBODY, AGAIN. OKAY, I AM DONE WITH THIS. IF YOU KNOCK ON MY DOOR AGAIN, I WILL CALL THE POLICE. KEEP THAT LOCKED UP. UM... KYLE'S GONNA BE HOME SOON, SO WE'LL... JUST STOP! DAMN IT. UM... YOU HEAR ME? I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YEAH, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HER. OF COURSE I'M CONCERNED. SHE'S NOT SLEEPING. YOU GUYS SEE IT. SHE'S... SHE'S, LIKE, NOCTURNAL NOW. THE OTHER NIGHT, I GET HOME LATE. YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY LEFT, AND I FIND HER UPSTAIRS, AND SHE'S ON THE FLOOR, RIGID LIKE... LIKE... LIKE A PLANK, AND I... AND I TRY TO WAKE HER UP. I CALL HER NAME. I SHAKE HER, AND THERE'S NOTHING. SHE'S GOT THESE SCRATCHES ON HER ARMS, OKAY? SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. HOW DO I KN... WASN'T HER... HAVE YOU SEEN HER FINGERNAILS? SHE... SHE CHEWS THEM, OKAY? SHE... I HAVE LONGER FINGERNAILS THAN SHE DOES, RICK. I'M SEEING WHAT YOU'RE SEEING, BUT I DON'T... IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME? SHE LOOKS PALE TO ME. SHE LOOKS... SHE'S WEAK TO ME. SHE'S DISTANT TO ME. I AGREE WITH ALL THOSE THINGS, BUT I DON'T... I HEAR A VOICE THE OTHER NIGHT. I-I GET UP, I FIND HER SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM ON THE COUCH, JUST STARING AND TALKING, AND SHE'S NOT TALKING AS HERSELF. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SHE'S NOT... IT'S NOT... IT'S... SHE'S USING SOMEBODY ELSE'S VOICE. WHAT'S THAT? I DON'T KNOW. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. THAT'S... OKAY, GOOD. THAT'S... THAT'S GOOD. - I MEAN, I WILL CONSULT ABOUT THIS. - YEAH, CONSULT SOMEBODY... - HAVE YOU TALKED... - WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING, OKAY? KYLE... HAVE I EVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE? NO. THIS IS ONE OF THE RECORDINGS FROM RACHEL'S MIC. OKAY. CONGRATULATIONS. YAY. HEAVEN? I'M GONNA SCRUB IT, AND I WILL LOOP IT FOR YOU. I TOLD YOU. I MADE IT CLEAR. SHE CAN'T LISTEN TO THAT SHIT. I DON'T WANT YOUR SOUND MEN SEEKING THAT SHIT OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS! SHE RUNS WITH IT. I KNOW SHE DOES. OKAY? - LISTEN, MAN... - WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WAS THINKING... I WAS... RACHEL CAME OVER TO ME, UM, WANTING TO LISTEN TO THE... WHAT THE CREW PICKED UP ON HER MIC, AND SHE CAME TO ME AS A FRIEND, AND THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SHOW AT ALL. NOTHING. I PLAYED HER THE RECORDINGS. UM, THAT WAS IT. IT WAS... IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SHOW. SHE JUST WAS SOMEBODY WHO REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. UP UNTIL THAT POINT, UH, 87 SEPARATE RECORDINGS. WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE TO YOU? VOICES? VOICES FROM BEYOND? THAT'S A NICE IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU KEEP TELLING RACHEL? PERFECT. DON'T DROP THE SIGN. WHAT WAS I THINKING? JUST KIDDING. I'M KIDDING. WHERE'S OUR GIRL? I DON'T KNOW, KYLE. WHAT? SHE... I THINK SHE'S USING THE BATHROOM. SHE WAS JUST HERE. RACHEL? HEY, BABY. WHAT YOU DOING? YOU'RE PAINTING THE NURSERY. RIGHT NOW, WE GOT SOME PEOPLE HERE, AND THEY WANT TO SEE YOU. EVERYTHING'S GONNA GET DONE, AND THERE'S GONNA BE PLENTY OF TIME. ALASTOR SAID THE BABY'S COMING AND THE ROOM ISN'T READY. OKAY, GUYS. YOU GONNA HELP ME? KYLE! RACHEL? HEY. STOP, STOP, STOP. HEY, IT'S... - HEY, WHAT HAPPENED? - THAT'S NOT MINE. IT'S NOT MINE. I WAS JUST DOING THE DISHES, AND HE CAME AT ME. RACHEL? RACHEL, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? - AND HE... - WHAT? OH, MY GOD. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS BLOOD? KYLE? BARBARA, CAN YOU GO INTO MY ROOM AND GET MY PHONE OFF MY BEDSIDE TABLE? YES. RACHEL, JUST STAY THERE, ALL RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD MOVE HIM. I NEED TO CALL THE VET. RICK? RICK, WHAT... RICK, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? JUST KEEP... JUST KEEP FILMING THIS. JUST KEEP ROLLING. RICK, CAN YOU COME HELP ME? I-I DID IT. I DID IT. I DID IT. HOW'S SHE DOING? SHE'S... WELL, SHE'S OKAY. SHE'S RESTING. I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR DOG. I'M GONNA GO SEE HER. HEY, BABY. IT JUST HAPPENED SO FAST. I JUST TURNED AROUND, AND HE WAS THERE, AND I... MM. HEY. YOU GET THAT CAMERA OUT OF MY FACE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? SHE SAID MADDEN CAME AFTER HER, CAME AFTER HER BELLY, THEN HE CAME AFTER HER, AND SHE HAD TO PROTECT HERSELF. SO, WE GOOD? SO, RACHEL, UH, YOU KNOW, HAD HIM PUT HIS HAND ON HER BELLY, UM, YOU KNOW, TO FEEL THE BABY. AND WHEN HE DID, YOU KNOW, SHE SAID, "CAN YOU FEEL IT? IT'S INSIDE OUR BABY." I MEAN, THAT'S... I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO? I FIRST STARTED TREATING RACHEL AFTER HER FATHER'S DEATH. MY ORIGINAL DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT SHE WAS A MANIC DEPRESSIVE, SO I TREATED HER WITH MEDICATION. HER MOTHER ASKED ME TO COME DOWN AND EXAMINE RACHEL AGAIN, AND I FOUND THE SYMPTOMS TO BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THE FACT THAT SHE STOPPED TAKING HER ANTIDEPRESSANTS COULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE, BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE BIRTH? YOU GOT TO HAVE THE BIRTH AT HOME, AND YOU GOTTA GET HER BACK ON HER MEDICATION. PLEASE, WE HAVE GOT TO CONVINCE HER TO HAVE THE BIRTH IN THE HOSPITAL. - THERE IS JUST... - BARBARA, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE WANTS. SHE IS NOT THE ON... YOU HAVE TO CARE ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS, BARBARA. I AM HER MOTHER. OF COURSE I CARE WHAT SHE WANTS. I... THERE IS A BABY AT STAKE HERE. OH, MY GOD. I'M SORRY. THANK YOU FOR COMING. KYLE HAD A HARD TIME MAKING THAT... MAKING THE DECISION TO KEEP RACHEL AT HOME, BUT ULTIMATELY, HE FELT THAT HE HAD MORE CONTROL WITH HER THERE. YEAH, I WANT TO LEAVE THE SHOW. NO, NO, NO, NOTHING PERSONAL, BUT I WANT IT ALL TO STOP. BUT... THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE WANTS. "PROOF," SHE SAID. SHE SAID THAT... THIS WILL BE HER PROOF. I THINK THAT SHE WANTS SOMEONE TO SEE WHAT SHE SEES. I WAS THE ONE THAT SUGGESTED THE HOUSE BLESSING. WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED INSIDE THE HOUSE, I THINK IT'S GOOD TO FORGET THE PAST AND TO START WITH A CLEAN SLATE. WHEN AN EXPECTANT MOTHER IS WITH BABY, SHE HAS WELCOMED JESUS INTO HER BOSOM, JUST AS THE VIRGIN MARY DID. WHEN YOU MOVED INTO THIS HOME, YOU WERE ACCEPTING JESUS IN WHICH TO GROW YOUR FAMILY IN PEACE AND IN LOVE. SO BLESSING YOUR HOME THROUGHOUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WILL BRING ABOUT A BETTER SENSE OF THE PRESENCE OF JESUS IN YOUR LIFE. OH, LORD ALMIGHTY, BLESS... BLESS THIS HOME SO THERE MAY BE PEACE AND LOVE IN THE EXPECTANT MOTHER AND HER BLESSED HUSBAND. IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, AMEN. BLESS THE... - SIT DOWN. - YOU OKAY? YOU FEEL FAINT? WHAT IS IT? I FEEL... YOU WANT SOME WATER? NO. HERE. ARE YOU OKAY? NO, I JUST... HERE, LAY DOWN. I'M AFRAID FOR OUR BABY. STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS, RACHEL. JUST STOP. OKAY? WHAT... WHAT IS IT? DO YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT YOU SOUND WHEN YOU SAY THESE THINGS? I JUST... I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING AND IT WANTS OUR BABY. - THERE'S NOTHING. - YES, THERE IS. - THERE'S NOTHING! - YES, THERE IS. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE HOUSE! STOP SHOUTING! STOP SHOU... THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BABY! STOP SHOUTING, KYLE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU, OKAY? STOP IT. KYLE. CAN WE TAKE A BREAK, PLEASE? WHAT? WHAT THINGS ARE... I CAN'T EXPLAIN THEM. STOP THE CAMERAS. HEY. LET'S TAKE A BREAK. I... WHOA, HEY. SHUT THE CAMERAS OFF! BACK OFF. KYLE! HE'S JUST... I'M SORRY. UM... GOD. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AND... OKAY. WE'RE DONE. - OKAY. - I DON'T KNOW. NO. OKAY. IT'S OVER. I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING... I THINK YOU SHOULD GO. IT'S LIKE I CAN'T TALK TO... GET OUT. - JESUS. - GET OUT. FATHER ALVAREZ, I THINK YOU... GET OUT! - I'M COMING. - GET OUT. OUT. NO. GET OUT. OUT. I'M SORRY. I'M... EVERYBODY, GET OUT. EVERYBODY, GET OUT, PLEASE. I'M NOT LEAVING. - BARBARA, PLEASE GET OUT. - I'M NOT... BARBARA, GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW! I'M NOT LEAVING MY DAUGHTER WITH YOU! MOM, MOM, JUST GO. GO! YOU KNOW, I-I FELT LIKE WE HAD COME SO FAR. WE JUST HAD TO FINISH. KYLE TOOK SOME CONVINCING. I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND LIKE IT'S NOT EASIER WITHOUT A WHOLE CREW OF PEOPLE AROUND. I'M HERE. YEAH, YOU ARE HERE. I'M NOT SURE WHY. I SPENT ALL MY FREE TIME THERE. I WOULD EVEN STAY OVER SOME NIGHTS. I FELT LIKE I WAS PART OF THE FAMILY. SERIOUSLY, SHE'S GAINING WEIGHT, WHICH IS GOOD. BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S... NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE ALL THE TIME. SHE'S NOT SLEEPING ENOUGH. SHE'S EATING FUNNY. SHE THINKS MARLENA HAS RUN OFF. MARLENA? HER MANNEQUIN. SHE'S MISPLACED IT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE GONNA CAPTURE. I JUST KNEW THAT WE HAD... NO, IT WAS NO CASH-GRAB. IT WASN'T ANY SORT OF EXPLOITATION TO FINISH FOR MY OWN PROFIT. NOTHING LIKE THAT. IT WAS ABOUT... IT WAS ABOUT, TOGETHER AS A GROUP, FINISHING WHAT WE STARTED. THAT WAS IT. THAT WAS IT, AND SOMEBODY NEEDED TO BE THERE FOR HIM. AND I PRAYED FOR RACHEL AND THE BABY. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? UH, IT'S LIKE MAKING SMALL TALK WITH SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO IN A WHILE. WHAT? THIS ISN'T FAIR. LET ME SEE YOUR UNION CARD BEFORE I HAND THIS TO YOU. ALL RIGHT, HERE YOU GO. NOT A TOY. TOUGH TIMES DON'T LAST. TOUGH PEOPLE DO, BROTHER. WE'RE IN THE WHITE FLAG LAP. WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. WOW. LOTS OF ACTION. I THINK WE'VE GOT THE HEART OVER HERE. YEAH. THERE WE GO. OH, THAT'S SO STRONG... AND HEALTHY SOUNDING. WHAT WAS THAT? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. OPEN THE DOOR! ARE YOU OKAY? IS SHE IN THERE? RACHEL? SHE'S IN THERE? SHE'S IN THERE. RACHEL? RACHEL, OPEN THE DOOR, BABY. RACHEL, OPEN THE DOOR. HONEY, LET US IN. RACHEL. I GOT IT, BARBARA. WHAT THE HELL? WHY DIDN'T YOU ANSWER THE DOOR? HEY, BABY? CAN WE LOOK AT THIS REAL FAST? WAIT. WHY? I JUST WANT TO SHOW 'EM REAL FAST, JUST FOR A SECOND. OKAY? IT'S ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH. THE BABY KICKING. I THOUGHT YOU WERE COVERING RACHEL TONIGHT. RACHEL? BABY? JESUS CHRIST. OKAY, LET'S JUST NOT... OKAY. RACHEL? BABY? KYLE? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE MIRRORS? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST THINGS IN HER HEAD, YOU KNOW? JUST... SHE SAYS THAT THEY'RE A CONDUIT TO THE... SPIRIT WORLD. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'M SUPPOSED TO AGREE WITH HER OR TELL HER THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. SHE WON'T TALK TO ME, YOU KNOW? WHAT DO YOU WANT, KYLE? KYLE? WHAT'S WRONG? I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN BED. MM-MM. I, UH... I THOUGHT I JUST SAW BLOOD ON THE FLOOR. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, COME ON. YOU NEED YOUR SLEEP. - LET'S GO. - NO, NO, NO. NO. I JUST NEED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH WITH ME, OKAY? BUT I FEEL SO ALONE. YOU'RE NOT ALONE. I'M ALL ALONE. I'M ALONE IN THIS. - YOU'RE NOT ALONE. - YES. I'LL STAY WITH YOU. COME ON. RACHEL? SWEET DREAMS. RACHEL? WHAT THE FUCK? RACHEL? RACHEL? OH, MY GOD. JENNY, UH, IS RACHEL WITH YOU? IS RACHEL THERE? ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO. SHE SAID EVERYTHING. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I JUST... I'M SO SORRY.
