[BELL] -Captain Carter. The General is expecting you, Sir. This way, Sir. -Glory be, you a soldier, boy? I mean, you in the army? -Yes, Sir. -What's this? -Well, my uniform, Sir. -Your uniform? -Yes, Sir. You see, I'm detailed to General Auden, Sir. -Glory be. -I'm glad you could come, Carter. -I never say no to a general. -Kings and counts used to dine on this terrace. -You should feel right at home. -Captain, I have a job for you. -I appreciate the hospitality, General, but I'll walk to Berlin before I mix drinks for you. -Captain, we have people to do that in the army. No, I want you for something else. I want you to save a dam. There's a dam on the Aufgang Lake, right. Here Our man force is more than 50 miles away, here. If the Gerries know we're coming, they'll blow it up. And if they do, they'll stall our advance for at least two days and flood the valley. What we want to do to is surprise them from the south. Now, the nearest unit is B Company, 3rd Regiment. -So send them in. -Carter, I'm afraid you miss the point. We've got two days to save the dam. This mission requires the experience of a commando, and you were available. You'll be flown to B Company and dropped. Oh, the code name is London Bridge. From there on you're on your own. You'll be behind German lines the minute you step out of camp. 28 miles down this road is a farmhouse with a friendly contact and the radio. You'll spend the night there. 12 more miles down the road is an abandoned winery that will be your base of operation for the actual assault. I'll uh, see that you get a promotion. Wouldn't it be nice to wake up in a few days, a major? -Mmph. -If I was a German, you'd be dead by now. Can you talk, boy? -Jonathan Crunk, Private, B Company, US Army. -B Company. -First Platoon. -London Bridge. London Bridge! -Hickory Creek, Georgia. -Don't you know the password? Where are the flares? -What flares? -You were supposed to light a flare at 0100 hours and bring me in. -What time is it now? -Can't you tell the time, Soldier? -I can tell ordinary time. I'm not very good at army time, yet. -Oh, you're in trouble, Private. I never seen no one stand guard like that. Yes, sir. Big trouble. Where's the outfit? -Down the road a piece. -Take me to it. And move, boy. Your helmet. -Hah hah hah. Mate. -I'm a first class fool. You know, I should have seen that. -You're learning fast, Lieutenant. You'll be beating me regularly in no time. -Let's call it a day, huh George? Hey, I hear the boys have some action in the mess tent. -I've never been lucky at gambling. Not that I have anything worth losing. But there's nothing worth winning around here, either. -I'll tell you what. You teach me how to play chess, and I'll tell you how to cheat at craps. You can win yourself a few buck. -Thank you. But I'm going to have to beg off this time. An old man needs his sleep more than a craps festival. You know, you play a good game for an officer. See you in the morning. -Hey George, it says here you can change places between the king and the rook. Now you never told me that. -Maybe it's cause I'm not George. -You sure ain't. What can I do for you? -You can salute, boy. -And who would I be saluting, if I saluted? -Captain Carter. And I'll break your arm if you don't. -And if I do? -What do you mean, if? Are you drunk, man? -A little, I suppose. Wine does that. Uh, wait a minute. It's over here somewhere. Just a second, Captain. Oh, here we are. Lieutenant. -Who's is it? -Mine. Just a little dirty, that's all. I used it to cook some stew in yesterday. -Where's your C.O.? -Wallace. Edward B. Would you like a drink, Captain? Genuine French wine. Vin Francais. -What's the matter with you, Wallace? I've had men court martialed for your kind of lip. -I guess I'm in shock. We don't see too many white folks around here. -You don't see many... white folks? Well, how many of you uh, people are there here? -People? You mean, how many black men in this company? Here they are, Captain. B Company, proudly serving their country. Can I introduce you? I'm sure they'd love to meet you. Well, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll join the game. -Hey, boss, you gotta stake me man, it's going to hit this time. -All right. I'll give you a million. For half the take. -What? -Half. -Hey, you found yourself some luck tonight, huh? But you still owe me 3,200,000. -I'll get it, I'll get it. Just give me some time. -Hey, Wallace. Would you like a warm beer? -Sure. -Fuzzy? Hey, Fuzzy? -Man, you ain't no good. You didn't have shit to do just because he's deaf. -He's getting a beer, ain't he? All he's good for is sleeping up the place. -Good thing we ain't in combat, cause he'd never hear the shot. I don't know how he got in the army anyway. -Because he couldn't hear the man when the man told him he was 4-F. -Hey, Crunk. Yes, Sir? -Aren't you supposed to be on guard duty, man? -Yes, Sir. But I brought the man in. -Yeah, well get on back out there. I'll send somebody to relieve you in a couple of hours. [GAMBLING NOISE] -Wallace? General Auden sent me here. -You mean you need 20 men to wipe spit from the General's chin. -Give me your radio. -No chance. -Watch your mouth, sonny. -The radio's been broken for three weeks, and we don't have the parts to fix it. -Well, there's one where we're going, so forget it. -What would I need a radio for, anyway? They'll tell us when to move. -I'm telling you now. -We've been in this stinking war for three years. We get our orders from General Smythe. We're the first to arrive and the last to leave. And we don't have orders yet. -You do now, mister. -Pheww, you got to be kidding. What time do you want to move out? -0700. -0700. Good night, Captain. Eeeee up! All right, soldiers. Up at it. Up and at em. Come on, boys. All right it's time to go. Come on. Get up. All right. Come on. Get up out of there. Come on, soldiers. Everybody up. Formation. Fall in. Time is now, Come on, let's go. Come on, Big Jim. Everybody up. Come on, soldiers. Hey Lewis. What's happening, George? All right, soldiers. Come on, get up out of there. Fuzzy! Where's Fuzzy. All right, soldiers. Fall in! Gentleman, this is Captain Carter. He's got a few words he wants to say to you. -Lieutenant, can I see you in you tent? -At your pleasure, Captain. -My pleasure is right now. Sit down, Wallace. -No thanks. -This isn't a company. It's a circus. They isn't one man out there with a uniform. Only half of them has guns. The half has a goatee. They won't even stand up straight. How in mother's memory am I supposed to get those men 40 miles into enemy territory? -They can do it. -How do you figure? They aren't even soldiers. -They are soldiers, Captain. Bona fide members of the Armed Forces of the United States. -A soldier fights. -A soldier does what he is ordered to do. Everyone of those men volunteered to fight, to die for his country. They've been here three years, Captain. Three years waiting to face a gun. You know what their orders have been? This is a service company, Carter. Sanitation detail, mess detail, burial detail. Did you ever wonder what happened to those trenches once you leave, huh? Those stinking trenches that you can't stand to go near because they make you vomit? B Company fills them up with lye and mud and then goes someplace else to dig another. Don't tell me they're not soldiers because they don't fight. -Take a look. Come on, take a look. Take me again they're soldiers. -They are. -Hah hah hah. They're black men doing what they know how to do. The army just gave them a job doing it. -Well then, Mister Carter, you and that dam are in pretty big trouble. -I need seven men. You and six volunteers. -You want me to choose six of my men so's you can get them killed? -I want six volunteers. You want to ask them, or shall I? -I'll ask them. But just for the record, I hope the first bullet hits you right between your big blue eyes. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. All right, all threes step forward. You soldiers in the rear can fall out. The rest of you, we've got a job to do. -Hey, Crunk. Where we going, man. -Boss said something about a dam. -Who's the white fella? -Says he's a captain. Him and the boss was giving it to each other a few minutes ago. -What kind of dam? -Oh, man. Why don't you two shut up? Ain't going to be no dam. Just going be some more latrines. -I've seen Italian latrines, French latrines, and Belgium latrines. German latrines ain't going to be no different, right Crunk? -Yeah, but we don't need no white man to tell us that. -We don't need no white man at all. Hey, uh, Brightman, gimme a cigarette. -A what? -A cigarette, man. -Sure, sure. -You still writing in that diary thing? -Uh-huh. Only it's not a diary, it's more like a journal, about us. -Let me see. -No. -You said it was about us. -It is. -I want to see what you're saying about me, man. -Let him be, Lewis. -Shut up, fat man. -Hey, man. I know what is says, without even looking. Uh, it says, Private Lewis, A-1 soldier in the US Army, single handedly wore his 35 dirty t-shirts without once holding his nose. -You ain't gonna have no nose to hold. -Hold it! All right, that's enough. Get your gear together. We move out in five minutes. -Hey, Doc. You want to keep this for me? It'll be safer with you. -Sure, I'll keep it. -When I want to write some more, I'll get it from you. -OK. -Boss says we move out in about five minutes. I Think we'll get to see some action this time? -Well, it had to happen sooner or later. BRIGHTMAN (VOICEOVER): July 23rd, 1944. We encountered heavy action today. Lost three men to enemy artillery. The company fought magnificently, killing 23 of the enemy before taking a machine gun nest. Lieutenant Wallace cited three men, myself included, for bravery under fire. I am continually awed by the heroism of this company under the severest of conditions. I will receive the medal of honor at a ceremony when we reach Berlin. WALLACE (OFFSCREEN): Fall in! Ok, let's move out. -Hey, soldier. Join the ranks. -Sorry, Captain. My mind is quicker than my body. -Your mind don't do the walking, soldier. -Yes, sir. Hah hah hah. -Something amusing you, mister? -Three years ago, I would have laughed anyone in the face who said I'd be in the army today. -Then why'd you join? -Oh, a number of things. Duty, patriotism, stupidity. I thought I could be useful. -Do you find your too hard, boy? -Oh, no, Sir. I love every minute of it. -What do you do? -What do I do, Sir? -What's your work? -I am a cook, Sir. A first class cook. -The army needs cooks. -Evidently. -What's his name, Wallace? -Whose name? -The soldier I was talking to. -Hayes. Private Hayes. -Seems to be smarter than the average foot soldier, don't you think? -He's a teacher. -That a fact? -Mm-hmm. -What's he teach, arithmetic? -No, physics. -What? -Physics. -Where? -Howard University. -University? Hee! Don't that beat all? Know how to use that thing? -I've used it before. -In combat? -Yeah. I was in combat before I joined the army. I'm 34th Street division. That's in Harlem, baby. If you'd a come near me then, I'd a used it on you. -Throw it. -Where? -That tree. [THUNK] -Send them down the road. -We should stay on the high ground, use the trees for cover. -We're going to stay on the road. Farmhouse isn't far ahead. -I don't like it, Captain. -We save an hour this way. OK. Down! Down! [AIRPLANE ENGINES] -Everybody get down. Down! -Get down, you crazy fool! -He can't hear you. -He's deaf. -Where is everybody? Captain Carter? -Fuzzy! -We saved an hour, Captain. Come on, help me bury him. -There isn't time. -Would there be time if he was white? Hmm? So long, buddy. Well, stop looking at him. He's just as dead if we bury him or not. C'mon, let's go. -That's gotta be the place. Follow me. I'll take a look. [GUN COCKING] -London Bridge. -Is fallen down. -Into the barn in the back of the house. -Place ain't much, but at least it's softer than the ground. -It ain't for sleeping, Big Jim, it's for eating. -Why do we have to spend all day here? This place stinks. -(GERMAN ACCENT): Would you rather spend it outside? You can wave to the German patrols when they come by. There are many of them in this area. -This is Frau Renvic. Frau Renvic, B Company. -Gentlemen. [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SPEAKING GERMAN] -You speak that German stuff pretty good, Doc. -German, Crunk, is the language of physics. And cooking, Captain. -(GERMAN ACCENT): The transmission will be at 1300, but if you need me, I'll be in the house. I hope you have a pleasant rest, gentlemen. -Thank you. We better check on the radio. Come on. -I'll show it to you. -Uh, Captain? You still haven't told us where we're going. -You go on. I'll be right there. -B Company is to proceed to the Aufgang Dam, 5 kilometers north of the town Ofsted, and secure said dam until the arrival of Allied forces. -Is anyone guarding this here dam? -Yep. -We going to have any help? -No. We can't make radio contact for another hour. Get some rest. -Uh, Captain Carter, Sir? How we going to do it? -I don't know, soldier. -(GERMAN ACCENT): You will have to pretend this is tea. I made it from some roots. -I'd never know the difference. -(GERMAN ACCENT): You don't want to rest like the others? -The others don't know what I know. -(GERMAN ACCENT): What do you know? -That we'll all be dead tomorrow. -(GERMAN ACCENT): Why do you say that? -Because he's right. It is a company of clowns. Never even got through basic training. Never even fired at anything except tin cans. And they're supposed to capture a heavily guided dam? Suicide. -(GERMAN ACCENT): No, I don't think so. I watched my brother put on a uniform and march off to the war. Then he got to the barn and he turned around and he waved, but there was no smile. And I had no smile either. Then I watched him go. Do you know why? Because I knew he was going to die. -How? I mean, how did you know it? -(GERMAN ACCENT): Because he was fighting for the wrong side. And so, I look at you now, and I can tell. -Then tell me. -(GERMAN ACCENT): You can smile when you wave goodbye. -Earlier today, I watched a man die. He was on the right side. -(GERMAN ACCENT): I don't know about him. I just know about you. -No, you don't about me, and you don't know about my men. I wish to God I could believe that righteousness could save our lives, but-- -(GERMAN ACCENT): Do you doubt your men, or yourself? -I don't know. There was a time when I knew, but-- -(GERMAN ACCENT): You know, I think that you are a strong man, but that you've let something make you doubt yourself. But if you believe it, then you will be dead tomorrow. -Do you believe that? -(GERMAN ACCENT): Yes. -Thank you. -Get away from her, Wallace. What do you think you're doing? Don't ever let me see you touch a white woman, or so help-- [SMACK] -(GERMAN ACCENT): You're in my house, Captain. Even if there's a war outside, you're a guest in here. -Your incredible, Carter. The lives of seven men are on the line, and you spend your time protecting the virtue of white women who get too close to black man. I feel sorry for you, man. -Uh, I was thinking. -You're not in Georgia, anymore, Carter. -I know. -Do you? Or are things over here supposed to stay the way you like them, everybody in his place? -I didn't ask for this mission. -Oh, that makes me feel better. You didn't ask. That changes everything. -I didn't ask, but I expected soldiers. I don't want to kill these men. -Well, you are. Little by little, a word here, a shove there, and you make a man feel small. Well, you think on that, when one shot from a friend can save you, and that one shot doesn't come. -This is London Bridge, come in Blue Nose. GENERAL AUDEN (ON RADIO): This is Blue Nose, go ahead London Bridge. Over. -Auden? First, I want to thank you for this mission. You couldn't have picked a better outfit. GENERAL AUDEN (ON RADIO): Did you take the dam. -We're on our way, General. GENERAL AUDEN (ON RADIO): I'm coming in tomorrow 3rd Regiment. That dam better be there. -Tomorrow? GENERAL AUDEN (ON RADIO): Roger. Carter, we need that dam. [TRUCK ENGINES] -Captain? GENERAL AUDEN (ON RADIO): Carter, did you hear me? I said we're coming in. Carter, did you hear me? Carter? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] -Guten tag, Fraulein. -Guten tag. [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Only five of them, and seven of us. If we open up on them now, they'll never know what hit them. -No. If they don't report in, there will be a search. We don't want the whole German army snooping around here. Let's just wait a few minutes and see what happens. [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Anna. [SPEAKING GERMAN] , -Well, what are they doing in there? -Shut up. -They could be coming around behind us. -Lewis, I said shut up. -Man, we are like sitting ducks in here. -Come on, boss, let's split. -No, not yet. -Oh, leave him in there. Let them have him. -I ain't dying for no hillbilly, honky officer. -Where are you going, soldier? -Far away from here, baby. -That's desertion. -What side are you on, man, that cracker's, or ours? -You make one step toward that door, and I'll kill you. -Boss, we could leave. -Is that what you waited three years to do, huh? Run when the going gets rough? You leave now, you deserve to dig holes for people like him. Now, who wants to make a move. -Let's get out of here. We have a long night. -Look! More trees up ahead. -That's what woods are made of. -Yeah, good hiding places. -Don't get cold feet us. -I know we ain't going to make it. With the trees looking at us, I can feel it. -Stay waiting. We'll find out soon enough. -I don't want to die, Big Jim. -Hey man, ain't nothing to it. -I don't want the pain. -Just curl up inside yourself. -Look! -Where? -I see one. -See what? -Up in the trees. [GUNFIRE] -Get them under cover around the bend. [GUNFIRE] -Captain, they're over there! -Stop it! You'll get us all killed. -Captain, shoot them. Shoot them. (CRYING) Shoot them. Shoot them. -Get out of that hole, mister. -Captain? -Shut up. I'll give you 'til three. -I don't want to die. -One-- -Please, Sir. -Two. Three. -Let me talk to him, Sir. -You got two minutes. -Shoot, guys, shoot. -There ain't nobody there, buddy. -What? -Just us chickens. -Don't make don't difference. Gonna shoot me and I can't move. -Man, ain't nobody gonna hurt you. -I'm scared, Big Jim. -Yeah, I know. I'm scared, too. -Not like me, Jim. I can't even walk. -Sure you can. Just get up on out of there. -I can't. -Anybody can be scared. It's what you do when you're scared makes you a something or a nothing. -I always been a nothing. -Maybe. But now you got a choice. All right. I'll leave you. And I'll tell Carter to come back with his pistol, and he can tell all his white friends, man, I knew them niggers couldn't cut the mustard. They just curl up in a hole and let me shoot them in the head. And 100 years from now, black men will be cleaning latrines just like you and me. So long buddy. -Been a while since they made any wine here. -Coulda saved some for us. -Take one of your boys and check inside there. -Lewis. That one's all clear. Crunk, you and Big Jim check the others, huh? -Hey Doc, can I get my notebook from you? -Keep writing, kid. -Hey, Jokester. -What? -Can you get in there? -Yeah, hah. -Go on. -Last one in is a wino. -Hey, Lewis. We need a volunteer. -You got a lot to choose from. -We want you. -Any special reason? -You can use a knife. You may have to. -We want you to scout the dam. Pick somebody else to go with you. -Got it. -What do you think? -He'll be just fine. -I want you to get as close as you can to the dam. You'll have to skirt the lake to get to the other end. That's where the detonators will be. Make a drawing of where the charges are placed and get back here 1200 hours. [LADDER CREAKING] -From my foxhole, I can hear the sounds of artillery fire less than 100 yards away. We are waiting for orders to advance to the front. The pressure of constant fighting is beginning to tell on the faces of the men. And we hope for a day or two of rest after the coming fight. -Find anything? -Nothing, boss. -Couple old bottles. -Good. All of you fall in over there. All three of you, come on. I didn't think we'd make it this far, but we've been lucky. You boys don't know how lucky we've been. But it's just starting to warm up. We've got to have that dam by nightfall, or it's not going to be luck that gets us through, do you understand? -Mm-hmm. -Open it. What are you going to use for bullets? Your rifle. Oil it. Better tuck those inside, soldier, you want to save your hide. -Yes, Sir. -I'm going outside to join Lt. Wallace, and when I get back you better be in shape, you hear? [LAUGHTER] -Now soldier, shine up those boots or I'll knock your eyes out. -Spit on them. Oil up that rifle, and burn that uniform. Smells like gasoline. -Yassuh. [LAUGHTER] -Straighen up that cap, soldier. -You got it. -You about through, soldier? [GUNSHOT] -Wallace! -Big Jim! Oh, god. Jim. -Must be up on that roof over there. You go to the right, I'll go to the left. -Don't die, Big Jim. -It's easy, Jokester. All you got-- -Hmm? Jim? Jim? [GUNSHOT] -I don't believe it. I think we've been had. -What? -We don't have a chance. -We come this far. I ain't going back without doing something. -Here, take a look. -What are they doing? -Setting the charge. I got a feeling we don't have as much time as we think. We better get back. -Well, what about the drawing? -We can remember. Come on. -Come on, come on. So? Where are they? -You know as much as I do, Captain. -I know more than you do, and I know they better get their bodies here in five more minutes. -If they don't come back? -They've got their nose in a sling. -I was thinking about us, Captain. -We go in without them. Unless you or somebody else has a better idea. -Lieutenant, it's Hayes. -Ahh. Look, you don't have much time. They're setting the charge. -Where's Lewis? -Hit a mine. He's dead. -Where's the drawing? -Never got it. But I remember. -Tell us. -Where's the charge? -There's eight of them, next to the water. But the plunger is on the far side, in the back of a truck. -Let's go. -No. Wait, wait. You take it easy, we'll came back for you. -Thank you, soldier. -You'll be all right, Doc. -You gonna be all right, Hayes? Then goodbye. -Hey, where's Crunk? -Now if Hayes is right, we should be able to see it from that hill. -Seeing it's one thing. Saving it's another. -Yeah, one thing at a time, Wallace. Come on. -It's still there. -Yeah, but not for long. Look. We got to get closer than this. -Maybe we can rush them. -And the first thing they do is connect the wires and foom. -All this time and we can just watch. -You take the man nearest the box. We can make it hard to get near the thing. We'll wait til most of them have left. [SPEAKING GERMAN] -What's going on? -Looks like the farmer is giving them a hard time. [SPEAKING GERMAN] -It's far gone, you ready? -Hey! It's Crunk. [GUNFIRE] -Cover me. (VOICEOVER): July 25. We've been assured by Major Wallace there will be a rest for us when we reach Berlin. The fighting has been hard. The strain almost unbearable. I will receive the medal of honor from General Eisenhower, but the heroism of B Company will be preserved by the men who have seen us fight and die. -Get his tags. I have to keep a record. What's in the book? -Just some notes. -Better keep that, too. Send it to his folks. -How's Crunk? -Uh-huh. -Hey, man. -Hey. Phew. I was going to be far away from here, baby. Then I say that hay wagon, and I had to decide if I was going to be a something or a nothing. And I had to do it. -You done good. -I had to do it. -Can you walk? -I don't know. It hurts pretty bad. -Come on. -Ow. -Easy now. Easy. Easy. -Hey boy, what you standing there for? -Hey boys, you better get some latrines dug. -Hey, Medic!
