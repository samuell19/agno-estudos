Subrip: Pix Fixes-Sync: VaVooM I gotta say, those get more and more appealing every time you make them. Yep. Perfecting a coconut lime tart is an on-going quest. It's like a triple Axel for a skater. You're never sure if you're gonna land it. Well those win the gold medal. When did you get in this morning? 4:30. Why so early? The oven's acting up again, I didn't want to take any chances before the party. Don't start. We can't get a new oven until we get customers. If we don't have a functioning oven we're not gonna have any customers at all. Two chefs with no business sense. What were we thinking? We weren't thinking. We were dreaming. Well that dream is quickly turning into a financial nightmare. Alright, Mr. Sunshine, cheer up. We are going to be a huge success, trust me. Trust me. Hello, you two. Hi, Helen. Would you like some olive bread? Always. Hey, mom. I already have napkins. Not as nice as these. They were half price. It was mandatory that I buy them. OK, well we'll use them for the engagement party. Did I tell you that I introduced the happy couple? I'm quite the match-maker. Yes, you mentioned that. Several times. Six couples and counting is a pretty good track record. What time will Tom and Jill be ready? I told everyone to get here at 6:00. Well I, we, would like to thank you for having the party here. We certainly could use the business. Well, the best food in town. Where else would I have it? OK, Marco? Will you do decorations? I have to get home and get ready. What are you wearing? I have the blue wrap-around dress from Hadley's. Not the low cut red? It's a party, mom, not a date. Well, you never know who you might meet. Well, I'm gonna wear the usual ensemble. What do you think? It's a good thing you can bake. You look really good in red. Am I too pushy with her? Yes. But you wear it very well. Hi Claire, you don't know me, but your mother suggested I give you a call. Seriously?! Maybe we can grab dinner tomorrow. My name is Peter Bloom. Call me back and let me know. My number is 206.555... No. Who is Peter Bloom? Peter, yes. He came to an open house of mine. He didn't end up buying, but a single man shopping for a four bedroom? I guess he wants to start a family. Mom, you have to stop setting me up. Claire. Pretty soon your dad and I are gonna be off traveling the globe and if he has his way we are not gonna be home very much. And I just... I hate the idea of you being alone. I'm not alone. I'm here at the bakery 24/7, which is exactly where I want to be. There is plenty of time for me to find someone and fall in love. There is nothing wrong with building your business but you can't plan when you're gonna fall in love. Look. I love this place. And it is enough for me. It is more than enough, believe me. Hey. Don't you look beautiful? Thank you, dad. Marco says that there's a wine festival in Florence that we would love. Not a bad way to launch our retirement. Sounds nice. I'm not ready for retirement. I'm still in my prime. OK, late prime maybe, but that's as much as I'll concede. Please go mingle. I have it all from here. We're being dismissed. I'd like to thank all of you for coming, and I'd like to raise a glass and wish Jill and... Tom? Tom. A lifetime of love and happiness. And I would like to toast my aunt, Helen, for introducing me and Tom. We can't thank you enough. I couldn't be happier for you two. - Cheers. - Cheers. Alright, drinks are on my big brother over at the bar. Let's go. Well, I'm glad someone appreciates my advice. Of course she does, because you haven't been advising her since birth. What to eat, what to wear, who to date. Claire. So dramatic. You know, sometimes it takes someone with perspective... Mom, stop. Please? Stop intervening. I'm perfectly happy as I am. OK, I get it. Loud and clear. Good. Now go have some fun. Let's face it. Sometimes we all need someone to dance with. Do you wanna dance? Hey, cuz. Hello. So one of Tom's friends wanted to meet you. The one standing next to my mom? Busted. Yeah. That's my cue to leave. Thank you. What part of "I'm perfectly happy as I am" do you not understand? I was just going to say... the tart was terrific. That is my favourite thing in the whole world. What? My daughter's smile. So... Peter Bloom? You are relentless. I'm standing there in the middle of the courtroom, all eyes are on me, and suddenly it occurs to me... do-do you want some more champagne? No. Because I have a whole lot to celebrate here tonight. Anyways, it occurs to me that what I have is not just a point of law but an actual breach of contract. Needless to say, I won the case. My goal is to have my own firm by the time I'm 40. Unfortunately, Peter, my goal is to go to sleep. I'm sorry, I've just been up since dawn. Yeah, sure. It was awful! Clearly this is not one of your more inspired matches. No one bats 1000. He returned his entree, twice. And, and he couldn't stop talking about himself at the top of his lungs. Next time I'll be more careful. My vetting will be exhaustive. No. No, there's not going to be a next time. No next time. That's it. That is the last straw. Please, I told you I... I will know when the right guy comes along. You gotta promise me, no more. Mom, do you hear me? Whatever you say. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight, mom. You have to let her find love in her own time, on her own terms. Hopefully in my lifetime. I think she's still hurting that it didn't work out last time. She can't dwell on the past. She needs to move on. Maybe you're the one that needs to move on, honey. We need to book those tickets. We'll get to it. What's the reluctance? We've been planning this new chapter of our lives for years. Our grand Italian adventure. Well, I like this chapter. I'm not ready to move on. But we get the best of both. Half a year traveling, half a year at home... I guess. Stop guessing, and just... do this with me. I want to, Sam, I really do, it's just... retirement. Don't think of it as retirement. Think of it as six months vacation. Well, it's a marker though. Another name for "getting old". I keep thinking I'm 23. So? Be 23 in Italy. If you wanna stay busy with work the other six months you have that option. Right. We still have a lot of time ahead of us. If you keep feeding me kale, we could live forever. It's a deal. Just understand I need a little time to take it all in. OK. Thanks. If I keep whining about Italy, your father's gonna go alone and I wouldn't blame him. What are you so afraid of? I don't know. Losing my daily routine, being away from you. I mean, who am I if not your mom? I have a very precarious sense of myself. I'm nuts, right? You're just figuring that out now? Look at this. This one on the clearance rack missing the skirt and this discount beauty missing the top. You do have a good eye. I do where you're concerned. You see? If I were in Italy that top and that bottom never would have met. It's true. Something to wear on your next blind date? That's not funny. That's a good one. Hey, my mom just texted, she got us a gig catering a fundraiser at an art gallery. She might drive you crazy but she is definitely good for business. Easy for you to say, she's not micromanaging your life. Maybe we can use this opportunity to pass coupons to the bakery. Great, so now we're gonna work for free? No, on the contrary, this gig actually affords us a new oven. OK, listen. I know that this is a long shot, but I know a guy who knows a guy who could contact that online restaurant critic. The Wandering Gourmet. Maybe we could get him to come in. A positive review from him would... Would be like winning the lottery, I know. Which is almost impossible. Have a little faith. On a lighter note, the gas bill is overdue. Great. David? Can I help you? My name is Helen Michaels. I'm actually Claire's mother. Did something happen? Is she OK? No, no, no. Nothing happened. She's not even here. She doesn't even know about us meeting. You're gonna find this hilarious, but I made that profile on Destiny Match myself. I was just trying to help her find a boyfriend. Can we sit? Let me just start by saying... I know how strange this must all seem to you. That would be an understatement. Well the truth is I am not even supposed to be doing this. My daughter, Claire, if she knew I was doing this again... OK, wait, you've done this before? Well, only twice. And it didn't really work out. Mostly with sons of friends, relatives of friends, you know, the usual. And don't worry, that actually was her picture on the profile. Excuse me, I just need to ask. Why are you telling me this? Well, I suppose because I wanted you to... You know what? I think I'm just gonna cut my losses and say goodnight. No, no. No, wait. It was nice to meet you. Good luck finding your daughter a date. You're gonna need it. Look, everything I wrote about her was true. Yeah, you left out the part about her crazy mother. Your house chardonnay, please? Having a rough night. You heard all that? Sorry, it's a quiet bar. Can anyone actually die of embarrassment? So let me get this straight. You were posing as your daughter on a dating site? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'd be mortified if I were her. I mean, I'm sure your heart was in the right place. My heart has a mind of its own. Do you mind if I ask what prompted this strange behaviour? I have no idea what made me do it. I mean, why did I even come here tonight? I promised my daughter I would back off. If she found out she would disown me. Well, for what it's worth, my lips are sealed. She's very pretty, by the way. I'm sorry? Just your daughter. I saw a picture of her earlier when you were showing the... Yeah. You're so sweet. I'm... I'm Helen, by the way. Hi. Eric Carlton. So, what do you do, Eric? I'm a pediatrician. Are you married? No, Helen, I'm not. In fact, I'm waiting for someone. There she is. Hey. Hi, Eric. Sorry I'm late. It's been one of those days. Did you get a table? Yes, it'll be ready any minute. OK. And before I forget, I can't make that artsy fundraiser thing on Saturday, something's come up. OK, that's fine. I may need to get this. I have a patient coming out of surgery. Just a second. This is Doctor Dana Becker. Let me guess. Your first date? Second. It won't last. Excuse me? I'm a real estate agent. After 20 years of selling houses I can tell which couples will last. It's the respect, the laughter, the look in the eyes. Versus the ones who need me to sell the house when they split up. You and Doctor Gorgeous are not a good match. OK. Let me give you my card. In case you're in the market. Who was that woman? Just a real estate agent. Trying to sell me something. Well, you would not believe the day that I've had; back to back surgeries that lasted about six hours and to top it off... Hi. I'm here to see Dr. Eric Carlton? And who's the patient? I'm here alone. It's a personal Matter. Just tell him Helen is here. Helen Michaels. You're a real estate agent, right? That's right. I'm Donna Stanton. You sold me my house. You're kidding! It was a long time ago. You helped us get the loan. We could barely afford the down payment. Well isn't that great? We still live there, over in Kirkland. Well, you just made my day. Donna, I need you to... - Hi. - Hi. Can I... help you? I'm sorry, Mrs... Helen. Michaels. Yes, the real estate agent. I remember. I was just thinking about our discussion the other night and I was hoping I could buy you a cup of coffee? Helen and I go way back. She sold me my house. Yeah. You don't say? Well, there's a great coffee shop just down the block. Doctor Eric, will you sign my cast? You betcha, buddy. Here, you come over here. Let's take a look at this. This is you hitting a homerun. Coming around first base... But I don't play baseball. OK. Well, what do you play? I'm a science nerd. Good for you. I was a science nerd. Alright, then this is you winning the Nobel Prize for curing broken arms. Look at that. What do you think? Cool! No. What? Looks like you've got a bit of an owie behind your ear. Let me take a look at that. No, not another one... There you go. Thank you! You're welcome, buddy. That's very cute. Yeah. So how about it? A quick cup of coffee? I want to pitch you something and if you're not interested you'll never see me again. You won't regret it. You won't. Trust her. She'll find you a home in no time. OK, look. I can meet you in 20 minutes. But just for like five minutes. I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead. Just, down the block? Just down the block. Why can't I ever meet older, married women? Don't start, OK? She's a real estate agent, I met her the other night, she probably just wants to sell me something. Your secret is safe with me. Hey. Sorry I'm late. I had a baby with colic and a sleepless mother. Claire had colic. She's over it now. Forgive me... I'm just a little hyper. I've had two cups of coffee. OK, let me cut to the chase. I think you should meet my daughter. Yeah, didn't you say the other night that she was going to disown you? She doesn't have to know about my involvement. Besides, didn't you say your lips were sealed? Yes, well, that's when it didn't include me. Dr. Carlton, Eric, all you have to do is cross paths. You'll see. I know these things. Yeah? You know, I was there the other night, I would say that your batting average is less than stellar. Well, they can't all be home runs. But this, this is a sure thing. I just know it is. OK, well... you've got my curiosity piqued. What is your plan? Well, the other night I overheard that you were going to the fundraiser at the gallery? I was going to. But I'm not going now, Dana can't make it. Now you have a reason to go, because Claire's gonna be there. She owns a bakery. Her and her partner have the contract to cater the event. I won't even tell her you're going. Or that I even met you. You go, you meet her, you decide. I don't know. She's funny and kind, she puts up with me. Did I mention she's a pastry chef? You'll gain a lot of weight but you'll die happy. You really are relentless. Look, I'm not gonna say yes, but I will think about it. - OK. - OK. Fair enough. There's just one little hitch, though. What? Claire can't ever know we spoke. It's much better if she thinks she just met you by chance. I'm not that comfortable lying. Well, it's not a lie, it's just something to omit. You go to the fundraiser, you meet her, whatever happens, happens. I don't know. Look, you seem like a great guy. And she is the most incredible person I know, and I swear to you I am not just saying that because I'm her mother. Let me think about it, OK? You won't regret it! I promise! Goodbye, Helen. For a used oven it works great. We're lucky to find one with such low hours. Too bad it doesn't come with customers. Well, my mom said we should go all out for the gallery fundraiser. I'm thinking petit fours. OK. But make sure you use the glacé and include the napoleons. And your Mille-feuille is amazing, so I'll help you build it. What? She wants me to get my hair cut for the catering gig? What's wrong with my hair? Nothing. But it's your mother we're talking about. Hey. So how did you meet the real estate woman, anyway? She approached me at the Chameleon while I was waiting for Dana. Yeah. Dr. Becker. How's that going? What, you're not attracted to pretty and smart? Of course I am, it's just that she's kinda cold and has no sense of humour. Laughter is overrated. So, are you buying? What? Property. A house. A condo. I am not buying a house and I'm not dating the real estate agent. She's just trying to set me up. Wants me to... meet her daughter. Well Helen did right by me all those years ago. I think you should go out with her. I don't know. I feel like if the daughter is anything like the mom, she's probably crazy. You know what? The way she describes her, she actually sounds really cool. My man, don't do it. It's a mistake. This from a man who bought his wife a blender for their anniversary. I will have you know that was the Cadillac of blenders. Listen, there's no rush because I have until Saturday, but I really appreciate the concern you have for me, thank you. What? This is going to look great on you at the gallery event tomorrow night. It's beautiful, but I'm just the caterer. I'm not the belle of the ball. This is an important event. Besides, I got it on sale. I couldn't resist. Thank you, but you shouldn't have. You're a vision. Now, what are you gonna do for shoes? I think I have those open toed pumps. No, those are so plain. That dress requires a new pair of shoes. Maybe. I wish the event was as big of a hit as your desserts! I'll gain five pounds if I don't watch myself. Well I'm glad you like them. I also have a restaurant downtown... Hold that thought. Hi. Hi! How is your night going? Good. I'm Eric. These deserts are incredible. Where can I find more? I actually have a restaurant downtown. You don't say? What is it called? It's called Gilded Sweets Bakery. Great name. Do you have any cards? As a matter of fact I do. - 326 Franklin Street. - Yes. May I have a card? You can have this card. I can get another one. The petit fours are quite unique. Yes. I use almond extract to counter the sweetness. Well, all the desserts are quite exceptional. I'll have to stop by sometime. That would be great. You have to stop doing that, I'm going run out of cards. OK. I'll have you know I am expecting some sort of kick-back. OK, well you know where I am, come any time you want. All the pastries you can eat, on the house. Great. It's really thinned out in here, maybe we can take a look at some art downstairs? Sure. What do you see? I see the weird face of a yellow man about to eat a fish. While in a burning forest. That's open for interpretation I guess. I guess that's the point. I have been on my feet all day and these are new shoes. My gosh, you should take your shoes off. Art is so much better barefoot. I prefer pieces that depict the human condition. Such as...? Edward Hopper. Windsor Homer. Georgia O'Keefe. Artists that break your heart in the best way. What about you? Mine is super corny. I don't usually divulge that type of information on a first date. That's presumptuous. Is it? No, I swear, I won't judge. Norman Rockwell. I like the way he captures children. I completely agree. He really captures people's innocence. We're closing now. I wanted to thank you and let you know I'll be using you again. Great. She's got a little restaurant downtown. I'll be sure to stop by. 326 Franklin. Say hi to your mom. I will. My mom got me this gig. Alright, I really should pack up. OK, well let me help you pack up. It's absolutely not necessary. No, I'd like to. Really? Really. OK. Thanks so much for your help. Yeah, you bet. So... what do you do with all the leftovers? Well, unfortunately they don't really keep. You don't throw them out, do you? Sadly, that's often what happens, yeah. I know someone that would absolutely love those. It might be a little unorthodox, but it is worthwhile. It might just be the best part of your evening. I don't know if that's possible but I'm willing to give it a shot. - OK, great. - OK. - Hi, Dr. Carlton. - Hi, Emily. This is my friend, Claire. Hi. Hello. I got stung by a bee and I'm allergic. I got all swollen up. Yeah. But you are gonna be just fine. Right? We brought you some yummy treats. How come? Because you were such a brave girl. - I was? - Yeah. My mom says I'm a handful. Well, you're a brave handful. Do you wanna try one? OK, take your pick. Good choice. - Did you make this? - I did. - They're really good. - Yeah? Thank you. Thank you. How about I bring you some more tomorrow. Would you like that? Yeah? You can finish that one here if you want. So if you're hungry I'll have some waiting for you later. OK. - Hi, sweetheart. - Hi, mom. My friend at the gallery said that you did a great job. Did you have a good time? I did except my feet were killing me. I had to take off my new shoes. I was just walking around the gallery barefoot. That's it? That was the highlight of your evening? Pretty much. That's all you have to tell me? I mean, I didn't really take too much to the art. I'm glad the job went well. Maybe it'll bring in some fresh customers. Yeah. Maybe it will. I know nothing. OK, OK, you're right. I liked her. Yep, I knew it. Tell us everything. Well, there's actually not that much to tell. I mean, we met at the gallery, got to know each other a little bit and took leftover pastries to the kids at the hospital. Sounds like my kinda date. Don't listen to him, I think it sounds romantic. It actually really was. And she's OK with letting her mother choose her dates for her? Well, that's the problem, she actually doesn't know that. That is a problem. I told you it wasn't gonna work. What are you gonna do? I don't know. I'm sure it'll work itself out. What? OK. Thank you. - Great news. - What? We actually made more than we spent yesterday. - That's fantastic. - I know. For the first time like ever, I actually feel like we have a fighting chance. Careful, you're starting to sound like an optimist. Well, we keep filling up the place like we have for the last couple of days, you can call me whatever you want. Speaking of customers, is it my imagination or have we become like the hotspot for the medical community? Yeah, I noticed that. I think it's Eric. I think he's sending people our way. He's really sweet. - You like this guy? - I don't know... maybe. It was just so romantic how we met at the gallery, but... I'm still getting to know him, so time will tell. I'm just shocked Helen had nothing to do with it. I know, can you believe it? She's gonna kill me when she finds out. Wait a minute. You haven't told her yet? No. Are you kidding me? You know how she is. Besides, I love that we met by chance. So for now, Helen can wait. Come on. On y Va. Fancy meeting you here. Yeah, what are the odds? I'm sorry, I was in the neighbourhood and I just had to know what happened with Claire. She hasn't mentioned it and I can't ask. OK, seriously. You just need to let this thing go. I promise, I will. I just need to know what happened. I liked her. I knew it! So you hit it off? As far as I was concerned, yeah. So what's the problem? Honestly? Her mother. It's true. You're right. I'm leaving. I was never here. We never had this conversation. I'm serious, Helen. I think you should call her. - You're the problem! - OK, bye! Don't forget to call her! This is the best, and the messiest, burger I think I've ever had. How'd you find this place? Well, the owner's daughter was a patient of mine. He insisted I come down here and try it out and I have been hooked ever since. OK, I have to ask. I'm curious. Why pediatrics? Well, I think it's because it's just what I've always wanted to be since I was a kid. What about you? Why pastry chef? When I was a kid my mom used to let me help her make dinner, and dessert was by far the most fun to make. And, I don't know, cookies became brownies, brownies became cupcakes, cupcakes became tarts, and on and on until the kitchen was the best place in the house. I think those were my favourite memories from my childhood. I know it's just pastries, but for me it's a form of expression. Well, I'm no expert, but I can tell you that you're really good at what you do. Thank you. What about the restaurant? How did that transpire? Well, I went to go look at places to rent and Marco, my business partner, showed up at the exact same time I did. We both couldn't afford the place on our own so we became partners. I guess it was just meant to be. Or just good timing. I don't know, maybe it's the same thing. If you didn't go to the gallery we would never have met. And I would not be having the best hamburger I have ever had. Can I ask you something really serious? Yeah. Can we order more french fries? Only if we also get another chocolate shake. That sounds like a plan. Yes. I gotta say, I'm having a really good time with you, doctor. I gotta say, I'm having a good time with you, chef. What are you doing Friday night? I don't know, what am I doing? - We got it! - We got what? It's unofficial, unconfirmed, but I just got a tip that The Wandering Gourmet is coming in. We're gonna get a review. Hopefully. Probably. Here's the thing. You never know when. You don't even know what the guy looks like. I mean, he could bust you or praise you and you'll never even know he's here. OK, we need to change our menu. We just have to pack the place with satisfied customers, and maybe your boyfriend can bring in some more of his friends. He's not my boyfriend, we're just dating. Have you told your mother about it? No. No, as soon as she knows I like a guy she starts naming our grandkids. OK, but you know how she feels when you keep her in the dark. I do. I know that. We're actually having lunch today, I'm sure she's gonna grill me per usual. - We're gonna get a review! - Yes. We're gonna get a review! We need customers! When are you guys leaving? As soon as amore mio picks a date. You know, if we don't get tickets soon, our whole itinerary gets scrapped. We're eating our way across Italy. You two are such foodies. I'll probably gain 50 pounds. Is there any part of this trip that you like? I can think of worse ways to spend my old age. Old age. My point exactly. I feel like we're packing it in. - Hey. - Hey. - Sorry I'm late. - Hey. Marco and I are re-doing the entire menu for this phantom reviewer. He better show up. Well your tiramisu is the best on the planet, so... That's a tiny bit over the top but I appreciate the sentiment. Well, hang in there, honey. Every new business is slow to take off. Mushroom risotto? Just a little bit. It smells so good. But I have to get back to work. How's my favourite niece? I am... I'm fine, Uncle Arnie. Thank you. Jill tells me you met a nice fellow? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. It's really new so don't get too excited. Does this new guy have a name? Yes, Doctor Eric Carlton. A doctor. - What field of medicine? - He's a pediatrician. Well, I like David or Diane for your first born. - That joke never gets old. - No. Well, maybe it's not a joke this time. I barely know him. Well, what you know, you like, right? Mom? Take it easy. You haven't even met him and you're meddling. You're right. If it works out, fine. And if not, no big deal. More risotto, anyone? That was way too matter-of-fact. Over the top or matter-of-fact, which do you prefer? Something in between would be nice. Fine. Name your first born whatever you please. Right. She's also really good with kids. Because she gave your patient a cookie? OK, it's just I don't know how to get around this problem with her mother. I don't think you can. That woman is obsessed. You're probably right. I just, I really like this girl, Nate. Careful. The carbs are clouding your judgement. How about that guy right there? That could be him with his designer glasses. He's meeting somebody. Look at this guy, he's definitely a critic. He's all judgmental. A critic who's meeting his wife and baby? I don't think so. What about her? Claire, she comes in every morning like clockwork. Double macchiato and a blueberry scone. The food was great. I especially enjoyed the olive bread. Thank you. I really did enjoy the food. Thank you for coming. Maybe he's the phantom critic. Could be. Thank you for sending all your friends in. It was very sweet. Thank you. So, your family, do they live here too? Connecticut. Or else I would have sent them as well, I promise. Is that where you grew up? Yep, Stanford, Connecticut since I was three years old. That's where my dad did his residency. He's a cardiologist. I guess you could say my future in medicine was inevitable. How about your dad? He is a financial advisor, but he and my mom are newly retired and about to travel to Italy together. They actually, they met in a college bookstore. There was one copy of Room With a View, which is set in Italy. They both needed it for an exam so they shared it. And by the end of the book they were in love. - That's a great story. - Yeah. Just think, if the clerk had more copies, I wouldn't be here. I think you should track down that clerk, give her a box of your pastries. It's the least you can do. OK, I'll get right on that. I must look a mess. I usually wear half of what I bake. I think you look perfect. Did I ever tell you when I was five I had my first eclair? The waiter was French and I kept thinking that he said "Claire", so I thought he'd named the dessert after me. It was hilarious. That's hilarious. Helen. Hello. What a nice surprise. I need to see you right away. Sure. Is something wrong? Yeah, we have a problem. But I thought everything was going so well. Yeah, that's the problem. Perhaps I could show you the house after you get off work? Is Claire there? Not exactly. I'll be down in just a minute, Sam. - Your husband? - Right. Can you meet at the Chameleon? Seven o'clock would be just fine. Bye. I thought we were going out for dinner? It's just a quick showing, it shouldn't take long. I'll meet you at the restaurant. Hey, what's going on? I think I'm falling for your daughter. And this is a problem because...? Because every time she talks about you and how she and I met, I have to lie. And she thinks it was fate that brought us together. But it was her mother. We need to tell her the truth. OK, but please let me do it otherwise she will never forgive me. OK. But you have to do it soon, because the longer you wait the bigger the lie becomes and then neither of us are going to be able to save this relationship. The Wandering Gourmet does not pull any punches. Listen to this scathing review for Etoiles de Danse. "I had the misfortune of ordering the trout almandine "which was dry as a bone." No, I know that chef. Poor guy. It gets worse. "The fois gras was as forgettable as the ambiance. "Cold, bland, no panache." What if this backfires, Marco? Maybe we should do something about the lighting. Or some fresh flowers, or maybe some linen... OK, I'm having nightmares wondering if this guy's gonna show up and ruin our lives. Or save us. One positive review from this guy could change everything. Well, we're hanging on by a very thin thread here. I say we give the restaurant a little make-over before he gets here. I knew I should have become a fireman. Hi mom. Hi sweetheart. I'm kinda busy. Can I call you later? I really need to talk to you. OK, but not now. I need to fix up the restaurant. I have to go shopping. Well, I can go with you. Shopping for what? Panache. I'm on my way. Claire and I are going shopping. I thought we were going to see the travel agent today? Maybe later. Later? Don't be like that. Claire needs me. Well, she's a grown woman, she can shop alone. It's not just that. - She and I need to have a talk. - About what? This doctor she's been seeing. It's just a little girl talk. Don't start interfering, Helen. My interfering days are done. That's what I wanted to tell her. She knows that you love her, that's all that matters. This would be great for serving pastries. Well, we'll get two. They're half off. Great. Look at this tablecloth. That's nice. Listen. I wanted to talk to you about something, darling. About what? This doctor you've been dating. Eric? You're gonna love him. He's kind, he's honest. I really feel like he's someone I can trust. And did I mention that he is gorgeous? I mean, it was just so romantic the way we met, it's kind of like you and dad. Just all these people in the gallery and somehow we found each other. Clearly we were meant to meet. They're practically giving these away. What about one of these on every table with an arrangement? Maybe not? What do you think? What do I think? I think from now on you should just make all your own choices. Just asking about the vase. Aside from my love life, I really value your opinion, mom. Helen is calling Claire now. It's a little late in the game for that, don't you think? I know, maybe. I mean, I wanted to tell her myself, it's just that Helen insisted that she tell Claire. She's right, you can't come between a mother and her daughter. That's right. I just wonder why she's not calling. Who? Helen or Claire? To be honest, at this point I'll take a call from either one. Look at it this way: if it doesn't pan out with Claire, the lovely Doctor Dana Becker is still waiting in the wings. I ran into her in the elevator. She asked about you. I think you're missing the point. He's in love with Claire. You're in love with her now? I don't know. Look, all I know for sure is I don't want to lose her. At all. So... do you think I should call her? - No! - Yes! And so, amore mio, we start in Venice, we head south to Tuscany... muito romantico. Si. And then Pisa, and then Florence. Como estai? How are you? Don't ask. Did everything go OK with Claire? It was fine. Just fine? There was so much I wanted to say and I just couldn't find the words. Now it may be too late. What do you mean? You know, if we go on this trip. "If"? What happened to "when"? There's a lot on my mind, Sam. Can we just-can we talk about this some other time? You know, if going to Italy is going to make you so miserable, let's forget it. That's not what I mean. I just wanted to make you happy and... I'm not sure I know how to do that anymore. If you figure it out, let me know. Sam... No, I'm not making any more plans. Italy will still be there next year. It's you and me I'm worried about. Hi. What are you doing here? I just... I wanted to come see you. Well, hello. Hey. Come in. - I tried calling you earlier. - My phone died. It probably went straight to voice mail. Right. Yeah, I just... I wanted to know how you were feeling. Right now I'm tired. I meant about us. I don't know what you want me to say. Just the truth. The truth is I'm confused. - And you should be. - Are you confused? - No, I'm concerned. - About what? Sorry... how was... how was your day today? I read a horrible review on another restaurant so I decided to spruce this place up and my mom and I went shopping. Right. And how did that go, with your mom? Great. Good. That's great. What? My mom and I always go shopping together. Yes, but today went really well. Yeah. Yeah, I got a couple tablecloths and some trays. And-and you're not mad? No, I'm not mad. They were half price. And I talked to my mom and I told her about you and how we met and they want to meet you. - That's great. - Yeah. So I was thinking maybe this weekend? - Fantastic. - Yeah? OK. I'm so sorry, I just couldn't close the deal. All you did was shop. That's right. Thank you for understanding. No, I don't understand. Of course not. I'm confused. Are you speaking cryptically or literally? Exactly. We need to meet. Great. Just text me when and where. I appreciate you giving me a second chance to earn your business. I'm going for a run. Now he's going for a run. Great. Here we are, almond croissant, tiramisu. Enjoy. Do you think that's him? I don't know, everyone's looking like a critic to me now. Yeah, I got this. Yeah? OK. Hello. How are you? Our specials today are brie and fruit with freshly baked rosemary bread, home made scones with raspberry glaze and of course our coconut lime tart. Why "of course"? Well, because our coconut lime tart is one of our most popular items. So of course it is one of our specials. Very well. I'll let you know when I've decided. Great. Well, you just take your time. I don't know. Marco, he ate the croissant, every last bite! Yes. And a scone, too. Do you think I should offer him anything else? No, we don't want him to suspect that we know that it's him. Let's just let him enjoy his coffee. OK. Who is she? I don't know, maybe it's part of his cover. OK, go find out. No. Go, go, go. Hello. What can I get you two? You must be Claire. Yes, I am. I'm Dr. Carlton's receptionist. He suggested me and my husband come in. So you're not a restaurant critic? Excuse me? I'm an accountant. Great. That's all we needed. Excuse me. Back away. You know, the food is good but the service is a little peculiar. - Mom, could you just... - OK. Just one second. - I guess he hasn't told her yet. - Who hasn't told who what? I completely forgot I have a showing. OK, well... call me later? I have good news. What? I talked to Eric and we're all getting together this weekend. We are? I thought you'd be excited. I am, very excited! - Gotta go. - OK. So why didn't you just tell her? I tried, but she kept talking about you and how happy she was. I just didn't have the heart. Or the courage. Take your pick. - The longer we wait... - I know. I know. I went to the bakery today to try to tell her again, but Donna from your office was there. - What? - Yeah. Did she say anything? I have no idea. The second I saw her I hightailed it out of there. This is not gonna end well. It looks like my meddling has finally ruined everything. No. Look, if it wasn't for you I never would have met Claire in the first place so for that, thank you. - Hey. - Hey. Looks good. Nice try, Arnie. It's ridiculous. I ordered it a month ago as a surprise for Helen. It didn't seem so big online. It's nice. She'll love it. Listen, Sam, I need to talk to you about something. What's up? Well, I was running some errands downtown and I hope I'm doing the right thing. I saw Helen walking in Waterfront Park. Yeah, so? She was with a man. Sure. She meets with clients all the time. Well, this looked like more than just a client. Arnie. Whatever it is, it isn't what you're thinking. I took a picture of them with my phone. I printed out a copy. I'm sorry, Sam. Look, I have no idea who he is, but trust me, it's not what you think. - You're sure about that? - Very sure. OK. But if I know my wife, she's definitely up to something. Like what? That's what I intend to find out. Alright. Unbelievable. Sam? I'm home. I picked up some salmon. I thought we could marinate it in a mustard sauce. I'm guessing you're not in the mood for fish? We need to talk. Is this about Italy? Italy is the least of our problems. What are you talking about? I'm talking about George and Neil... Who? And this guy in the park. How could you do this to your own daughter? - How did you get this? - Arnie saw you two. - Who is this guy? - That's Eric. Claire's boyfriend? Sam, I was only trying to help. Tell her Helen, or I will! I went online posing as Claire in the hopes of finding her a date. When they found out I was her mother they ran for the hills. As they should have. Eric was sitting at the bar watching all of this. We struck up a conversation and ten minutes in I knew he was the one for Claire. This is so wrong in so many ways. I know. They're so perfect together and I may have ruined it. You have to tell Claire. I'm serious, Helen. If you don't, I will. And this new obsession with match-making has to stop. Actually, I've been match-making since the day we met. What are you talking about? That day at the bookstore? Yeah? There was another copy of "A Room With a View". You were so nice and I wanted to get to know you, so I hid the other copy. So my favourite story about us is a lie? Great. I've been carrying around that secret for 34 years. Forgive me if I don't sympathize with your burden. Well, maybe this is a better story. I had an instant crush and so I acted fast. And here we are, a lifetime later, still in love. Say what you will about my methods, but sometimes I do get it right. I doubt your daughter sees it that way. You know, the day we met, you didn't have to manipulate fate. I never would have let you go. If you could make a wish in that fountain, what would you wish for? An honest wife. You said that too fast. How about you? - Would you want a wish? - Yes. Another 34 years with the love of my life. It really is big, isn't it? Eric, it's me. Sam knows. What? He says he's gonna tell Claire. I knew this would happen. I know I'm preaching to the choir. This review could make or break us. OK, well maybe we can take a few more catering gigs to stay afloat before The Wandering Gourmet wanders our way. What if we're counting on something that's not gonna happen? I need you to stay positive, partner. Aye, aye, captain. I think I'll wander home. See you in the morning. Alright. I can't give up on you. I won't. Hello? Hey, it's me. It's Eric. - Hey. - Hey. I hope you start making a habit out of this. I'd like to. Do you want some napoleons or cherry scones? Take your pick. Maybe later. OK, well how about the hospital? We could bring them to the kids. Not tonight. Alright, well I just have to get something out front. Look, Claire, there's something I need to tell you. This happens all the time. Just another thing to fix and pay for. Yeah. So, look, I wanted to tell you... Tell me what? - Just about the night we met. - Very romantic. Yes, it was very romantic, but... it wasn't by accident. So you agree with me then? Sorry, agree with what? That it was fate that brought us together. Here. Flashlight on it. I... have a candle. - That's better. - It is better. - Great. - There you go. What do we do? I don't know, I'm just a doctor. Well, I'm just a baker, so clearly two professionals that are completely useless in this situation. That's it. The breaker box. Where's the breaker box? - You are smart. - Right? OK. The lights are off in the kitchen. I need to check the fridge. It's off! Everything is going to spoil! I have to call my mom, she knows a good electrician. Are you OK? Yeah, yeah I'm good. Who are you calling? My mom. Who is that? That's Eric. He's there? Yes. The lights went out in the bakery. I'll call my electrician and send him over. Are you OK? No. The electricity went out. But nothing else is wrong? Isn't that enough? Sam, she's with Eric. Did he tell her about your match-making? Apparently not. Maybe I can have the electrician tell her. Joke all you want but you have to deal with this. You, not Eric. This is your mess. I know, I know, I just... I don't know how or when or what to say. More importantly, how are you going to explain to her why you did it? I don't wanna go there right now. It's probably because I'd rather meddle in Claire's life than deal with my own. Well, why don't you try telling her that? It's a good opener. Your guy was great. It took four hours but he finally got the lights on. Said it was faulty wiring in the walls. Eric helped him out. Speaking of Eric... And then, after all that, he goes back to the hospital because a little kid has an ear infection. Darling, I... I love that he's a pediatrician. I love... I love everything about him. Hey hon. Hey. Your mother has something she wants to tell you. Well first you must have a scone. I salvaged them from the fridge. They're your reward for finding him. Thank you. - Finding who? - The electrician. Who do you think I'm talking about? I'll tell her, I promise. A full confession. It has to be today. Mom. What is this? So you find these guys online, meet them in a bar, and that's how you found Eric? But he wasn't one of those. Actually, he was there on a date. OK, so he witnessed your insanity and he still thought it was a good idea to meet your daughter? Not quite. I had to convince him, so I went to his office and... You did what? I'm trying to confess here. And so I sort of arranged for you to meet at the gallery. But I did not arrange that magical moment when you two first saw each other. You were there? Yes. She didn't tell me that, either. You didn't tell me that. Don't blame Eric, blame me. I can't believe he would sign on for something so crazy. He wanted to tell you. Yeah, well he had ample opportunity. - He was afraid you'd be mad. - Well I am! I am mad! - Honey, I'm so sorry. - So am I. We could always put up a sign. "Closed due to heartbreak". No, I'll be fine. Maybe. That bad? I don't know. I think I'd convinced myself that I had all the time in the world to find the man of my dreams and suddenly he's right in front of me. And the fairytale begins, but lo and behold my mother has orchestrated the entire thing. Nothing is ever just my own. And this time I just don't know that I can forgive her. Is that Eric or your mother? Eric. Sooner or later you're gonna have to talk to him. Not now. Not until I figure out what I'm gonna do. OK. I'm gonna go. You need a lift? No, I'm good. - OK. See you in the morning? - Yeah. I had to see you. I have a long day ahead of me. I can come back tonight. No, I don't think it's a good idea. I just need some time to figure this out. We really need to talk. I'm not even talking to my mother right now and she's my best friend. Or my worst enemy. I'm not really sure which one anymore. I just... I feel we owe it to ourselves to see where this goes. Don't you? I'm sorry, I can't... I can't do this. Claire... She won't talk to me. She won't talk to me, either. Let's make a pact. Whoever she forgives first, we'll get her to forgive the other. I don't think you and I should be making any more pacts. Yeah, you're right. You don't have anything to worry about, though. She's gonna forgive you, you're her mother. I know how Claire feels. I felt the same way about my mother. She was always telling me what to do. Always trying to plan my life. But she meant well. Sounds to me like you're just repeating her behaviour. Is that your medical opinion, doctor? Well, I do deal with a lot of moms. What about your mom? She is very opinionated. But warm. Funny. Who does that remind me of? How about that guy in the corner? The one with the bow-tie? He's arrogant, he certainly fits the profile. OK, so we'll just be really, really nice to him. Of course. Because I'm usually so rude to our customers. Come on. You know that's not what I'm talking about. She looks familiar. I think she's one of my mom's friends. OK, I'll take her, you concentrate on bow-tie. Offer him something not on the menu. OK. Hello. May I help you? What do you suggest? Well I would strongly suggest the spinach prosciutto croissant followed by a chocolate eclair and I just baked a beautiful olive bread. You could always take that home. Alright then. I'll have everything you just recommended. I just hope it's as good as you make it sound. It will be. Would you like a pastry? - I think I've had quite enough. - Great. Well perhaps I could refill your coffee? No, I'm done. Thank you. OK. Thank you. Do you think that's him? Yeah, bow-tie, arrogant, it's gotta be him. Thank you. Did Claire know you were coming in? Probably not. She's in the back. Thanks. You weren't answering your phone so I thought I'd just drop by. I'd like to order some humble pie, please. I really don't have time for this right now. I am so sorry, sweetie. Can you ever forgive me? You need to let me live my own life. I know, I will. You've said this before and yet here we are. But this time I mean it, I promise. No more meddling, no more blind dates. I really think Eric is the one. Your promise is barely ten seconds old and already you are giving me your opinion. Claire, I'm sorry but I believe in love and marriage and happily ever after, and I just want that for you! So do I! I want that, too, but I need to find it on my own. What if your mom had hand-picked dad? It would have taken the romance right out of it. I need to make my own mistakes, I need to find my own way! I never realized that I was... You are pushing me away! It feels like you don't trust that I can handle my own life! That's not true. It's just that... it's my way of hanging on. Not just to you, but me. The mom you go shopping with. The one you call when you need to share a secret or need encouragement. The mom you need. Not this woman. The one who's about to retire from who she used to be. You're always gonna be my mother. And I'm always going to need you. Even if you drive me crazy. Are we still allowed to hug? Yes. - I'm sorry, sweetheart. - It's OK. Here you go. Let me know if you need anything else. No. I'm fine. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. Is there always so much drama in here? You have no idea. Enjoy. You know what? Maybe it's for the best. I'll just throw all my energy into my work for a little while. No, that's a bad idea. You have to call her. Unfortunately I think that ship has sailed. You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself and just call her, or she will move on. Hi. Hey. Look... I was just hoping we could talk. I don't know. One cup of coffee, that's all I ask. You have to let me explain. Claire... please. OK. I'll meet you in an hour at that place near your office. OK, great. Yes. Mind if I join you? Dana. Actually... I'm sorry. I'm waiting for someone. OK. I just wanted to make something clear. I know I can be a little removed, but I'm interested, Eric, in case it doesn't show. Dana, I'm seeing someone. And she's gonna be here any minute. Is it serious? It is for me. Yeah. Good luck. Hey. Who was that? That's a doctor I work with. Dana. That look she gave me, I assumed she was more than just a colleague. Were you two dating? No. I mean, we did. It's... You were with her when you met my mother. Your mom told you I was on a date that night? This is a bad idea. No, look. We're not dating at all anymore. It was a couple times. It's just you now, I promise. - Claire, please. - Eric, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We got it! What? We got a review! What? What does it say? I don't know, my buddy just texted me. I'm just bringing it up right now. OK, hold on. "Gilded Sweets Bakery is a new entry "into the overcrowded category of little luncheonettes." That's not a very good start. Yeah, well just keep reading. "But this little place is a gem." We're a hit! He likes us! Let me read. "The olive bread was the real thing, "made with enormous skill." Your father's recipe. And his father before him. Papa! They'd be very proud. OK. "The delicate croissant filled with spinach and prosciutto "was a delightful surprise." Wait, he didn't order that, did he? No. But I know who did. The Wandering Gourmet is a woman! Well that would explain the good taste. "The chocolate eclair was beyond compare, "traditional yet complex. "My compliments to the chef." Yes, yes, very nice. OK, OK. "The ambience was equally appealing "and the owners provided wonderful drama, "both in and out of the kitchen." My mom is gonna like that. "I give this wonderful bakery a very enthusiastic four stars!" Yes! That's like the highest ranking! We did it! We did it! We did it! I'm so proud of us! See? You always knew it. - We have to get more tables. - And staff. Thank you. Maybe we could buy the place next door. Now you wanna spend money? Thank you so much. Can you believe it? We're out of olive bread. I'm gonna have to get baking. What can I get you? Honey, this is delicious. I wanted to make something really special. What's the occasion? Let's just say I've turned over a new leaf. From this point on I plan on letting things unfold without my involvement. Does Claire know about this? She's the one who gave me my marching orders. So I'm to get on with my life and let her get on with hers. She's a wise woman, that daughter of yours. If she and Eric ever get together that'd be great. From now on, her love life is none of my business. But who I love is up to me. How's the carbonara? I mean, only the Italians could think of putting bacon and eggs on pasta. Those Italians think of everything. We'll have to go there sometime. Are you ready for dessert? We just started dinner. I can't wait. Cappuccino cannolis, a present from Claire. And here is a little something from me. What is this? Two tickets to Venice? Then Tuscany, then the coast, then wherever you want to go, Mr. Michaels. I don't care where I go, as long as you're beside me, Mrs. Michaels. And then we finish the trip in Florence. I can't believe you guys are leaving so soon. Yep, one week from tomorrow. I almost wish we were there already. Claire, that's beautiful. Hello. Hi. I just wanted to thank you for that lovely review. No thanks necessary. You deserved it. Just promise me you won't give away my identity. No problem. I'm just happy it looks like you're becoming a regular. Are you kidding me? This is the best show in town. Yes, Claire's life is very entertaining, and it looks like another show is about to begin. I'll get more plates. Eric, please don't do this. I'm trying to get over you. How do you get over what's meant to be? I thought you didn't believe in destiny. I don't. Then what are you doing here? I'm here for you and I'm here for us. Come on, Claire. Meet him halfway. Eric... Look. You can call it fate or your mother's intuition or a coincidence that brought us together, but it doesn't matter how we got here because all I know is that I love you and I don't ever want to lose you again. Would you just kiss her already? Should we make her wait? She can wait, but I can't. You're so romantic. Subrip: Pix Fixes-Sync: VaVooM
