Laura, Shadows of a Summer (1979) You all right? I'm glad we talked about it. Yes, it's better this way. Paul. Yes? I'll call you. If you like, I'll see you at the gallery. You're still my favourite partner. Business before pleasure. Paul. Hey, Paul. Look. Come on, let's get something to drink. See those girls over there? They're in my dance school. You know, today I think I'd like to see them dancing. 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. Terrible. Take a break. Paul! Sarah! Well, that explains it. Explains what? She's your daughter, isn't she? Yes, she's my daughter. Why? She looks just like you when you were that age. For a moment I felt like I was 20 again. -You can't go back to the past. -Maybe, but that's how I felt. Come on, I'll introduce you. She's heard a lot about you. Laura, say hello to Paul Wyler. He smiled at me. But then my mother came in. So he didn't have any time for me. You like this room, don't you? I think this is my favourite place. You're so charming. Really? Yes, dear. Mama. Yes? Laura? Did you want something? Did you have a nice time with Mr Wyler? Yes, we talked and talked. You know how it is when you see old friends. What's he like? He's a very good artist. Was he glad to see you? Of course. We're old friends, after all. Mama? Yes? Can I ask you a personal question? Well, that depends on the question. I'm serious. Will you give me a straight answer? What are you thinking? He's your old lover. Laura! I'm old enough to know. Come on, it's time to go to bed. Oh, Laura! Paul asked if he could do a statue of you, would you like that? A statue? Of me? Yes, he needs photos of you, so if you don't mind I can take them. But... don't sculptors usually... Mama? Yes? I don't mind posing for him. No, Paul prefers photos. It's more convenient. Mama. I love you. Me too. Sleep well. Goodnight. Laura! I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. So, how was that? Wonderful. Very, very good. She enjoyed doing it. You're quite taken with her, aren't you? I was quite taken with you when you were that age. And now? I love your photos. When will I see her? I've already answered that. Come with her. Oh Paul, Laura's embarrassed enough that you have those photos. I had to talk her into doing them. I thought you said she enjoyed it. Paul, let's just drop this subject. There's enough weedkiller here for a lifetime. Hello, Costa. -Need a hand? -No thanks. I've got to go now. Wait, let me convince Laura to pose for me. Sorry, I can't. Please, Sarah. Make it a great statue. I'll try. I wish I was that young again. What would you do then? I don't really know. Costa! Don't touch those photos. Sorry. When's she coming? She isn't. How are you going to work then? Basic stance, follow me. First group, come on, quickly. 1, 2, 3, 4... Thank you. Second group. Look lively. Good, that's it for today. Would you come into my office for a moment? Who's the boy, Laura? What boy, Madame? The boy you're in love with. There's no boy, Madame. Very well. Are you going to pose for him nude? Will your mother let you? Come on, Laura, tell us. My mother gave him photos of me. Photos? That's no good, sculptors need a model. They have to see, to really see. So I would have to go there. That's the usual way. Where do you want this? Take it out. -What's this? -What? It's weedkiller, I'll put it away. Want to drive? No, you go ahead. -Yes, it's me -Easy now, easy... -Yes, the opening's tomorrow at five. -Put it there. I'll be so glad if you can make it. -Bye. -What about this? Over there. -Hello, Paul. -Hi. I was waiting for you yesterday. I started on a new statue, I couldn't just leave it. Of who? A perfect girl who sent photos. Paul... stay here tonight. No, I have to get back to work. That's too bad. That statue... Sure, I understand. Oh, I'd like you to send another invitation, if you could. Mr. and Mrs. Moore and Laura Moore. All right. Costa... My dear Costa... You don't have to hang around. You said you like people around when you work. You don't even have a model. Listen, Costa, I don't think I'll be needing you any more today. You can go now. Are you sure? I'll water the garden first. I'll get it. Where did you get that book on Paul? I got it in town. Can I see? Sure. Mama. The girls at school were saying... What are they saying? They said Paul needs a model to do the statue, not photos. And the book says that too. I don't care what the book says. Okay, Mama. I'm looking for a female form that is perfection. Can you explain? Neither child nor woman. But it must show the limit of her untouchable innocence. My focus is my vision of love, like a song. You're only faithful to your work, but not love? We always look for love. Sarah. Hello, darling. Everything okay? Yes. What about your trip? Successful! Only a short visit though. I'll get you some water. You're hardly here anymore. You should see your daughter. What about her? You've been gone so long, and she's getting more and more beautiful. Don't you notice it? Paul wants to make a statue of her. Have you seen the sculptor? Where are you going? We're going to see some friends and then going to Paul's exhibition. Didn't I tell you? See you, honey. Bye. See you later. Mama, has Mr Wyler said anything about my statue? I'll ask him. -I can't wait to see it. -Me too, darling. We have to go now. Will you say hello to him for me. Of course. Laura Moore and Mr. and Mrs. Moore GALLERY LA SERRE Beach Route - INVITATION Why did you do that, Mama? I was invited too. You don't want him to see me. Why not? Don't you see it's my turn now. The girls are always talking. But they don't know anything. Do they dream my dreams? Feel the same as me? If only I could see you. I know you'll feel the same way. Be near you. I know you'd understand my feeling. And then you would smile. And kiss me gently. I hope you'll call. I hope that you'll sympathise. I want to know what others know. We all long for love. I also need a gentle hand. Oh, Paul, this is my husband. Pleased to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. Glad to meet you at last. Sarah. Didn't Laura come with you? She said she didn't want to. Oh, that's a shame. You're looking handsome tonight. Should we get together later? At the reception, okay? What are you doing here? Bringing some candles. Just leave them! Have a great time, won't you? Sorry, it's my fault. Stupid jealousy. I'm even jealous of your statues. Paul. I'm going to go. I'll miss you. Don't touch that, Sarah, it hasn't dried. Sorry, Paul. I keep forgetting. Is she beautiful? I haven't finished. Paul. I want to talk to you about something. Let's sit down. Paul... Yes? Do you really prefer your statues to women? Because, if you like... Sarah... Sarah... Look at me. It's me, Paul. You'll be all right. I still love you. I love you too. No, it's my daughter you're infatuated with. It's you I love. So, let me stay with you a while. What about others? There will be other men. Kill them off, maybe? Don't change the subject. We're talking about you. Oh, Richard... No, we're talking about Sarah, she loves you, you know. But you can't see what she really wants. She wants you to show a little tenderness. To be there for her. It's you who's making her look somewhere else. What's wrong? Get out, get out! Richard! The statue! The statue! The case of Mr. Wyler it's serious. So... Perhaps it will take a long time for him to regain his sight. Wait here. Let's have a talk. Well then, my dear. Come sit here. -What's the matter? -It's my foot. -There? -Here. -I see. -It's really painful. You should remember it's important to stretch your leg straight. Have a rest, but stretch that once an hour. Right here, you should take it easy when you're dancing. Come back tomorrow. Goodbye, Madame. Laura. I'll come back later. Not so fast, Costa. Costa. You don't need to be here. I don't need anybody. Papa! She'll have to go away. And what about us? What will we do? She'll make new friends. She doesn't need us. And me? They can't just send me away like this. I'm not a child. I need to speak to Paul. Tell him everything. Make him understand. Although I don't know how to make him understand. I just know I need to talk to him about this. He must not forget me. Mama. Could you pack my things? Yes, sure. Why? I want to go and say goodbye. To your dance teacher? Yes, the dance teachers. Go and see your father first, he's leaving again. Laura. -Yes. -You shouldn't have come. It's me. Not yet. You've sculpted me. Laura, you really shouldn't be here, you should go now. I want to talk to you first. Let's go for a walk. -I want to help you finish the statue. -How, I can't see? By touch. It's finished. Let's go home. Subbed by Badge
