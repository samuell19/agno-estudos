Deal? What deal? The promise you made. Don't you remember? What're you drinking? Want some? and Eiji OKUDA What has a big fire above and lots of water below? No, switch it. What has lots of water above and a big fire below? Bathtub. Don't change the riddle. Then what is it? One-eyed goblin! Hey... that's right. That's last week's answer. So, I got it? Incredible. He can solve Tomo's whacky riddles. Sukemasa, who told you the answer? Tomo, you must be approaching the intelligence level... of this crazy. Hey! I'll be back. Granny, how're you doing? Huh? Kicked the bucket? Life ends, doesn't it? Life ends... Midori. Lupin. Cathy. How've you been? Good girl, Aja. Good girl. Good girl, Aja. Be good. It won't be long. Cathy, you're graduating today. You're a good girl. Come here. Okay, Cathy, it's graduation day. You're going home. What the hell, you old bag? Alright. I'll pay more later. Hey. Officer Dog is in trouble... Well, let's go. CLOSED Yes? Cathy! Where were you? I was so worried. You found her so quickly. I don't know how to thank you. It's my duty to be at your service. It's my greatest joy. Won't you have something to drink? I'm still on duty, ma'am. Don't you agree, Cathy? Please. Please. Come have some tea. Please. Here you are. Thank you. You know, if she hadn't come back... I might've died of a broken heart. My god... I'm talking nonsense. Ma'am... are you so lonely... BEAUTY SALON SAKAE Putting on lipstick, I think of what lie I shall tell. You are so sensuous... You almost make me faint. Mr. Saito, about what we talked about the other day... That deal...how about it? That? Count me out. I'm hopeless when it comes to drawing. Don't be so humble. If a master potter draws a picture for us... the newsletter will get more prestige. I'll draw for you. Don't be ridiculous. We don't want your scribbling. A picture by an eel restaurant owner? Get me another beer. I won an award in the Art Contest. In the art world, Suzuki is a well-known name. He only won one award. What? What d'you mean, ''what''? Birthday's coming up. Whose birthday? You moron. Your own daughter's birthday. What...! You remembered it. Of course. If I forget, that brat... would kick me out of your house. Thanks for all this. Mister. Mister. POLICE SCANDAL Mister. Did you draw this? Well...yeah. Can I sit here? This table's reserved for me ...go ahead. Are you an artist? Well, in a way...I am. Sweetie... you a high school student? Say...mister. Let's have sex. Stupid... What the hell are you saying? So...how much? Hey Mister... how old do I look? Let's see...17 or 18. Damn.. didn't work. How's that? I thought I'd look older with make-up. What's your name? Guess. Hiroko. Akemi. Keiko. Not even close. Names of your ex-girlfriends? Mayuko. Mayuko? Hmm...I like that. Why Mayuko? Well...you have beautiful eyebrows. Eyebrows? I drew them. How do you write ''eyebrow''? I don't get it. I still don't get it. I like this character. Wait a minute. Should make it a rule to get paid first. Your trick could run off without paying. I see. Thank you. You're a pretty strange one. ''I decided not to charge you anything.'' These letters are used, for example, in English and French. These letters are read ''dog''. Let's compare them with ''Kanji''. ''Kanji'' is originally hieroglyphic. Tracing it back to its original form... it's the shape of a dog. But the alphabet form ''dog''... Hello? ...will not inspire you to see the image of a dog. Because when the 3 separate letters, d, o, and g... are placed thus, only then do they come to mean ''dog''. Compared to hieroglyph, alphabet letters have no meaning. It is the same as one hydrogen and 2 oxygen molecules constituting water. I have to go again. Goodbye. By the way, about this word ''dog''. Reverse the order and... strangely, it becomes ''god''. Yoko. Brother, don't do that. Good... that's about it. SHO-UN-DO What has a big fire above and lots of water below? Weird riddle. Big fire above... Lots of water below... What could it be? EYEBROW So you switched from married women to school girls. ONE-WINGED BIRD In Heaven it will be the Phoenix. On Earth it will be whole. Time in Heaven is eternal, but on Earth, it is limited. The One-Winged Bird is a mythical bird... comprised of a male and a female... always flying united. It is often used as a metaphor... referring to the bond... between man and woman. Tomo, you missed again. Got it. Double score. Something serious happen? In this town? At most, kids harassing an old lady. But, uh... What, weirdo? High school girls are kids, too, and they certainty are delicious. Leave it out. I'll tell your wife. Come on, Nishi. Well...it was only once. Tell me where it was. But we're police officers. It's official business. Her skin was so different. When we took a bath together, her skin was so resilient. Here, Tomo. What's this? The girls love it. It works miracles. It's incredible. Who needs this? You should be cautious. If you don't use it, that's fine. But life's full of surprises. You can't read kids nowadays. No kidding. Eat this. What the hell?! Nishi! Outrageous! That one on the right is new. She knows absolutely nothing. How do you know? Hey. I know. I know. I'll throw in some extras. Call in all the girls registered here. Searching for a schoolgirl. Investigation? Murder. Murder? The details are confidential. Give me a break. Our girls are from good families. That's crap. I can arrest you. Want to be a murder suspect? You can't be serious! Anyway, tell all the girls to come here. Even if they're on the rag. Tell them to get here on the double. I'm having them call now. Please wait a bit. What band is this? My band. It's my band. It sucks. Great guitar for a rotten band. Can you tell? I knew you were different. Check it out. The real deal. He played this guitar. Look here... See. There's a scratch here. You moron. That's bullshit. It's true, no joke. I paid 1.7 million for it. I paid everything I had. Where d'you buy it? The last manager got busted for drugs, and now he's in the slammer. Officer Tomokawa... - Yah. - Guess what? What? Jimmy Hendrix... played the guitar with his teeth. Like this. This cop's totally screwed. We don't know that girl. Why don't you know? He's completely fucked up. Shut up! Do you all want to be arrested?! Listen up. School girls in Tokyo say they're no longer interested... in ripping off dirty ol' men, like you lousy hicks. Who told you that? I saw it on TV. In Shibuya they charge... 5000 yen for panties they bought for only 300. Pretty smart, huh? I was quite impressed. So what? You jerk-off. Shut up! Prostitution is out-dated. Your poor parents... must be turning in their graves. Our parents aren't D E A D yet. Shut up! Go over there and line up against the wall. Line up. Line up. Show your asses. Pervert. Pervert. You dirty pig. This here... is important evidence! I'm sure. What? ''I'm sure''? You morons. What you need is a spanking. I'll spank you, so show your asses. Come on. Show your asses! Brother? Grandpa! Uncomfortable, isn't it? The atmosphere is rather depressing. Please. Come back to me. We could leave this town... and live together somewhere else. It'd be great, wouldn't it? Only... I'm in love with someone else. Who would that be? You only moved here 2 months ago. Can you really leave me that easily? I...I never loved you, Teraoka. I know it. I know. You're so persistent. That's not it. I heard you...screaming out in pain. Luckily it wasn't serious. And no likely after effects. Ashame you came all prepared for worse. Only because... she made all that noise about you having a stroke. Dad, you're not young anymore. We thought you were dying, right? Anyway... it's best to take it easy... somewhere you're used to. The air is cleaner here. And you wouldn't like the hassle of living with us. Won't be good for you. Don't work too hard. We don't want to take over your business. Sell the shop and retire. Yoko and Sukemasa... We have to think about them. They can take care of themselves. They're old enough. You've really aged. You, talking like a father. Why won't he hurry up and just die. Take it. There must be bills to pay. You loser. If it's too tough, move out. Do what you like. I like it there. Why? Are you into some guy? That's no way for a mother to talk. Aren't you going to see Sukemasa? Even if I want to, he won't see me. Too bad. You always blame others. What? Yoko, I know it's not easy... We'll come again. What? He came to get you. To get me? What's this? It's really sick. Hey. I said, ''police-box at noon.' Hey... quit the undertaker's. It's too depressing. Become a policeman instead. Do you mean it? Can I be a real man? Sure. I'll teach you the questions on the test. Ah... I forgot. You can't. When you get tense, you get seizures. During one of them, the criminal will get away. Hey... I dare you. Pachinko. Let's play pachinko Where are you going? Hey! Pervert cop! Pervert cop! Pervert cop! That bastard. You should be old enough to quit sniffing glue! Oh, man...help...wow. You understand? Officer Tomokawa, Jimmy Hendrix really is the best. What're you saying? Get out. Get out. The undertaker's inside. From Sho-un-do? His grandkid's filling in. Hi. You're... Shyozo's granddaughter, eh? Professional job. Looks like he's still alive. So now you've become a real rock 'n roller. Did you know him? He was a hopeless punk. But make him look good. Hey... No! No! Don't! Stop it! Please stop it! Let me go! Let me go!! Let me go. Please. Don't. I looked all over for you. Did you approach me, knowing who I was? I knew. Who told you? Sukemasa? Your grandpa? I won't tell. What...? Just as stubborn as the old man. You searched for me? A full-scale search, rounding up school girls. Just... because I lied to you? Lied? I'm really a junior high student. Thought if you knew, you wouldn't bother with me. You're a real woman. So you acted like a hooker, but didn't take my money? God damn... did I get suckered. You said you were an artist. By the way, Miss Mayuko... what's your real name? Yoko. Get off. Take them off. You'll catch cold. But she's... That hag? Don't worry about her. Take'em off. Stop, I can't. Granny's watching. Don't worry. She's senile. We'll catch cold. Come on. Why won't you? Why won't you? What if you catch cold? Take'em off. You take them off, too. Show me your tattoo. Your grandpa... tell you about it? I saw a photo. Young and handsome...? Yes...you were beautiful. When I became a cop, I asked your grandpa to tattoo me... because I wanted to be a real man. I missed you so much. So did I. I'll rinse your hair. Again. Hey... how did you get this? Oh that.. a yakuza stabbed me. Because of this, your grandpa hates me. How come? Because I ruined his tattoo masterpiece. He figures he's a master artist. It was a life-or-death situation. Couldn't be helped. Grandpa's so stubborn. He really is. Hey, you get in, too. Never been in such a tub, right? Come on. Try it. Get in. Get in. Well? Doesn't it feel good? Hey... when you're out... let's do it again. Hey, wait. Please. Let me shoot once more. Come on. Please. Let me shoot. Come on. Let me. I'll teach you later. Hey. Calm down. Why don't we all rob a bank? Don't be stupid. You rob a bank, and you'll soon be caught. Hey. Teach her how to shoot. Why not? Yoko's my sister. Soon she'll be better than you. Says who? I have to be fair. I like both of you. Damn you. Put me down, Sukemasa. Put me down. Put me down. It's dangerous. Hey. Put me down. I'll protect you and Yoko with my life. All right. Now put me down. Shit, animals don't care where or when they fuck. Brother, stop. - What're you doing? Stop it. Stop it, Sukemasa! Ah...go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. I said ''go away''! Go away! Our dad died less than a month before. But mom picked up some guy. I was too young to remember. Since then, Sukemasa goes crazy, if he sees that. Take them. Thank you. Thank you. Just after I moved here... I read about a policeman who fired five shots... while chasing a lingerie thief. The article was very impressive. This policeman even draws lame pictures. And thinks up stupid riddles. I was new at school and had no friends. So I was attracted to him. Does this sound stupid? Maybe, but... When I finally met him, he was so irresponsible... but extremely tender. Am I being blind? But since I met him... I no longer hate myself. Damn it. It's dangerous. You're a big baby. Yellow, okay. Blue, okay. Green, okay. Adjust, okay. Switch... okay. You still at it? You promised to put those away. Hurry up and help me. Who are you? Brother. You're my younger sister... Yoko. What happened? Did someone bully you? Damn you. Coming. Grandpa, you're back? Hi. Grandpa... Grandpa... what do you want to do? Come here. If you tattoo me, I'll be marked for life. Nonsense. You're my dear granddaughter. I won't let that happen. You're contradicting yourself. You're right. I...at first I thought I had gone mad. It scared me. I said to myself, ''What nonsense are you thinking?'' But no matter... what I did... I couldn't hold back my desire to tattoo you. For the very first time... in my life... I've met someone whom I unreservedly want to tattoo. It's you, who came here 2 months ago... my own granddaughter. I have never seen such fair and fine skin as yours. But what about me?! No man will marry me! I won't be able to go swimming with my friends! And when there's a physical exam? And the teachers? Just tell them. There's nothing shameful in it. I can't do that. Nonsense! There's no law against junior high kids getting tattooed. Crazy man! Call me crazy all you want. Please let me do it. You're just like mom! You only think of yourself! This is Sukemasa. A-3, respond. Yoko, where are you going? Want a lift? What's wrong? Tomokawa... Why did you want a tattoo? I... was a real bad kid. Before I became a cop, I was always in fights. I caused trouble to everyone around me. When I became a cop, I wanted to break with my past. I wanted to become a different person. I thought a tattoo would be perfect for that. Very much my style, too. Say...isn't this a male? Isn't there a female? There is no female. I checked at the library. Each with one-wing, the male and female become one and fly. There's an old Chinese proverb about this. It's a metaphor about the sacred vow between a man and a woman. Research well done. My bird... has no mate to unite with. It only has one wing, too. There was a woman once, who said she'd get the female tattoo. But she didn't. That's why this bird will never be able to fly. There was a woman like that... Yes, there was. But... we were both very young. We never made a sacred vow. It was nothing serious. If she had kept her promise, the result would've been disastrous. When I think of it, it creeps me out. Tomokawa... If I tattoo the female... will we be able to fly together? Will you always be with me? Really? No creeps? Make me your bride? Sure I will, when you grow up. I am grown-up. A woman can marry when she's 16. You're right. Next year, you're 16. That's great. You don't sound serious. Finished. Get up. Come on. Get up. Look. This way. This way. Look. Wow. This is terrific. They're flying. It's Pa. It's Pa Yoko, the wind's for Pa. Cursed blood. What's that? His father died up there, too. Hung himself? Tomokawa, me...we were all here. Sukemasa was still little and cried out, ''Pa... pa!'' With his dad dangling above him, he jumped up and down all happy. Seeing that, I broke into tears. Move or get crushed! Nishi's here. The rescue truck hasn't come yet. Sukemasa, cut this out! Brother. I'll go and rescue him, too. It's too dangerous. You stay here. He's waiting for me to come. I'm coming too. Hey, keep her here. Nishi! Let's do it! Don't worry. I'll bring him down. Hey, Nishi. No closer! Son... is this what you want? You'll die before you become a real man. Then you can't play with Yoko and me anymore, eh. I don't wanna play with you two. Oh, don't say that. Let's go shoot the gun some more. Sukemasa, trust me. I know you inside out. Rescue Team's here. Move the car. Take it easy, Sukemasa. Yoko's laughing at you down there. I hate both you and Yoko. What're you mad at? Just get over here. Come over here. I saw it! You were on top of Yoko... and were like those dogs! I hate you two. You were doing it! Okay. You hate us. You can hate us, but please don't die. Hey. Come. Don't do it! Pa...Pa... Pa...Pa... She's only 15. What's your plan? I'm... serious about her. Whata fool! I don't care about social rules. I can't believe a cop is saying this. You don't have to impress me. You haven't changed at all. No need... to worry. About what? About Yoko... I'll forget her. I can't kill Sukemasa. Hey. Hey. Don't touch him. Don't touch him...I warn you. Never again... go near my grandchildren. Long time no see. What're you doing here? My kids seem to have given you some trouble. What... Shyozo tell you that? Yes... so I thought I should drop by to say thank you. So this is how it is. You alone? My partner's on patrol. Got a knife? I bought some pears. No thanks. Why not? You used to love them. I'm busy now. Liar. You were sleeping. Why are you acting so cold? We haven't met in ages. Go ahead. I won't bother you. Things good with your husband? Hey, what're you doing? You really hurt my kids. Don't do that. Don't turn me into a criminal! You behave, and I'll leave soon. Understand? I bet you did worse things to my kids. I just want to ask you a few things. What're you doing? When I finish, I'll take'em off. - Damn it! I can't help it. You'll hit me. Oi... if you want... to hit me... go ahead. Hit me all you want. Tomokawa, it's been a long time. I miss your bird. What the hell? Hey, stop it. Oh fuck off. Some sick joke! I'm getting pissed! I really am! Shut up! You molester. Why'd you do it with Yoko? Sorry...I have rotten teeth now. I have pyorrhoea. The dentist tells me to rinse a lot... because I have bad breath. Isn't it terrible to be old... Tomo-chan? My goodness... I'm... so wet. What're you doing? Where's your grandpa? Staying with brother tonight. I see. I should be with him too. With me around... his seizures will get worse. Drunk again? We have to talk. Don't want to. We have to. We have to think about your future. Forget it. I'm going to bed. What do you see in that cop? It's none of your business. Nothing to do with you. - It is. - It isn't. He used to be my man. I was going to marry him. Isn't there a one-winged bird on his back? I promised to tattoo the female on my back, but I decided not to. That's why he's got a grudge against me. He toyed with you just to get back at me. Liar. I'm not lying. Ask your grandpa. He told me if the woman... had kept her promise, it would've ruined him. Everything he says... is nothing but a pack of lies. You're just jealous. Ridiculous. I'm worried about you. You're not worried about me. You're just jealous 'cause... I took your man. Stop this nonsense. If I got jealous about all your affairs... I'd be dysfunctional. What do you mean? You can't fool me. Tomokawa isn't the only one... you've been sleeping with. You knew? Of course. And you let him do it to me? Don't pretend to be innocent. You hit on him. I didn't. Why would I do that? He forced himself on me. Even so he was my husband. How can you? You're the one to blame. Why me? You slept with him to get back at me. See? Gotcha. But it doesn't matter... you moved out. About Teraoka...I forgive you. But Tomokawa... I'll never forgive you. No. Gotta break up with him. I won't. I'll never leave him. He didn't sleep with me to get back at you! I made passes at him. I probably loved him before we met. I went for him hard, and then we had sex. I was so happy. I've never loved anyone so much. What... a kid getting off scribbling on his back! You know nothing! Mind you, some relationships last forever... understand?! Is it true? What? Tell me. Did you really sleep with that bitch? Tomokawa. I slept with her. It's not true. You're lying! I'm not lying. Go home. It's not fair. Did you do it to leave me? That's the kind of guy I am. I fell in love with you 'cause you're not that kind of guy. Don't underestimate me just because I'm a teenager. I love you so much. We shouldn't see... each other anymore. I can't agree to that. There's no going back. Since I met you, I felt good about being alive. Nothing else matters anymore. You have to be with me. This is goodbye. You have to understand.... I can't cause Sukemasa's death. I made porridge. You ready to eat? Thank you. Just take it easy and rest. For a young girl like you, everything that's happened... is too much for you to cope with. Please forget about the tattoo. I must have been delirious. Grandpa. Tattoo me. Nonsense. I don't want... to mark your body... for life. It won't mark me. It will... be a way to be with you forever. But... I have a request. I want the tattoo to be a different one. Not the Bodhisattva. She's at an old-age home. Her son came from Tokyo. She had a son? Yes. They offer full-time care, so it's very good. Even so... it's a tough world to live in. Oketa is really out in the sticks. You didn't kill anybody. The brass just want to save face. Refuse to transfer. But then Nishi... didn't kill anybody but broke the heart of a minor. If the brass are hassling you, come to my place and drive a truck. Least I can do for you. Who needs your help? I wouldn't have to look at your ugly mugs anymore. With you gone, this town will be peaceful. You have a point. But I'd really miss you. I'd miss a sucker like you, too. It's the last day of the races. Let's all go. Good idea. Let's win and get him a farewell gift. Are you kidding? You'll all come back broke as usual. So what? Let's go. Let's go. Okay, I'll go change. Tomo... Grandpa told me to get you. Hey... I'm not talking to you. We're not friends anymore. Sorry for the urgent call. I wanted to see the colour. Lie beside her. It's a colour I only used on you. Wait just a minute? Don't get a hard on here, you fucking cop. Hey, what's he doing in there? Grandpa told him not to look, so he hides in there. Grandpa, what's wrong? Old man... Hey, old man. Hey. Don't get upset. I'm just a bit tired... I no longer have any strength in my arm. You... have to finish it for me. All the colours are mixed and ready. All you have to do is apply the colour with the needle. I'll show you how. Please. Is the bath ready? Yes, it's ready. Good. Go bathe. 1...2...3...4...5 6...7...8...9... You've finally got the other wing. Neither you nor she... can fly alone. Take good care of her. I will do. ...91... 92... Thank you very much for coming so far. Yoko, bye. Thank you very much. My husband and I talked it over. Come here, darling. Yes, dear. Well then... - Please... We want to skip the complicated negotiations. How much will you pay for this shop? I brought an estimate. A lot lower than we expected. We don't need an old altar like the one in this shop. Only the land is of any real value. Don't be funny! You came to us, remember? Talking business here is absurd. What will people think? Then I'll come back later. Wait a minute. Don't be angry. I'm sorry if I misled you. I don't like to beat around the bush... and leave things unsaid. What about the hearse? You can pay a bit for that. Yes, but... Please...show me you're a real man. What are you doing? I pity you for having a fool for a son. What? I've been thinking in here. Giving birth to a fool like me, you lost something very precious. If I could return to your belly... I'd be reborn as a smart kid. Would you be a good mom then? Yoko, take him upstairs. I don't want him to be seen. Yoko! Yoko! Come on. Get him out of here. Yoko! What d'you think you're doing? Yoko. Sukemasa. This is cause for cerebration. Watch me. Like this. This isn't normal! Better call the police? What are you doing? Yoko. Yoko... What're you doing? Tomo, you shouldn't do this! You can't take the incense money! Go to hell, you fucking cop! What? Brother. Sukemasa. I'm... not such a great person. Someday... I may do things to make Yoko sad. If that day comes... take me... and kill me. You promise not to do it with Yoko in front of me? Sure. I promise. Shall we go? That's... grandpa.
