Swab. Swab. Close her up, please, will you, Johnson? Dr Harris, will you step outside, please? Five hours, John. I don't know how you do it. It worked beautifully. Another success. It's an odd thing, Steve. The more you succeed, the more you fear the failures. John Rowan. Whatever are you doing there? Ah, Lynn, darling. I'm afraid I fell asleep. Have you forgotten? Forgotten what? The party! Mike Orme's party. Oh. Yes, I'm afraid I had forgotten, darling. Little bit tired. I insist that you come. You promised you would. Lots of pretty girls. Dancing, music. You know I can never resist you. All right, dear. See you later. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Mmm. My face! You're spoiling my face. That's impossible. My public face, the made-up one. I prefer the private one, all scrubbed and shiny. Ah. But we ought to go up. Mike's expecting us. I don't think he'll miss us. Oh, please, John. Just a brief, personal appearance. By courtesy of Sir John... Rowan. That's one I haven't seen before, Lynn. It's beautiful. Haven't you seen that one? - Yes, hold it. - Mike! Wait a minute, will ya? - Lynn, baby! - Hello, sweetheart. Oh, Mike! What's a girl like you doing in a place like this, huh? - This is John Rowan. - Huh? - John, this is Mike. - How do you do? - Oh, what's this, a raid? - This camera made me famous, sweetheart. John's a surgeon, darling. Yeah? Well, you've come to the right place to get struck off. Hey, Kate! Fix the man a drink. Come over here, I wanna show you something. Would you like a drink? Whiskey, Dubonnet? No, thank you. Thank you. Jo! Take this drink for me, will you? - No, I've got one. - Well, have another one, darling. Hey, what's with all this, er... Sir John Rowan, famous surgeon, huh? - I'm going to marry him. - Oh, yeah? For the title, hmm? For the man. - You in the profession then? - Pardon? You in the profession? Photographer, you know. No, no. I'm a photographic model, you know. - Oh, yes? - Yes. What about your career, huh? Careers fade, darling. Marriage is forever. - Ah... - So they tell me. Come on, they tell you false, dear lady. They tell you false. Do you know what he said to me once? He said, "You've sold your soul for a mess of pottage." What's pottage? - I beg your pardon? - Pottage? Oh... it's a staple diet. To the ancient Israelites, it was as rice is to the Chinese. But I don't like Chinese food. Don't mind spare ribs. Have you ever been to Texas? No, no, I've never been to Texas. I've been to New York. I did an operation there. You're a doctor! How's your kiss of life? What a great scene! Come on there, babe. Get in there, girls. This is fun. Come on, girls. Give it him, give it him. Oh, baby! What a trip you're on, honey! Come on, hit him, babe! One more. That's it. Yeah, wild! Hello, darling! Enjoying the party? Lynn, I've had a heavy day. I have to operate again in the morning. Can we slip away now? - The party's just beginning. - It's a gas, sir, isn't it? Eh? - Me! - Don't be a hang-up, Kate. Me, me, photograph me! Kate, take a day off! If I'm going to photograph anyone, I'm gonna photograph you, baby. Have your fun with little Kate. May we go, please, Lynn? - But I want to stay. - Please, Lynn, come. Don't let's spoil the party, darling. "Don't let's spoil the party, darling." Kate... - Would you do me a favour? - Of course. Go play in the traffic. Come on, Lynn. Okay, Michael. Okay, baby, come on, let's show 'em, All right? And that. That's it. Oh, this is gonna be great. Hey, I'm first! Come on, get out of the way, will ya? Me! Me! Come on, Kate, cool it, will ya? Ah... Cool it, Kate. What the hell's wrong with you? Oh, that's beautiful, baby. That's really great. Now bung some cushions in, will ya? That's it. Now, get down on the deck, will you? Down on the deck, sweetheart, that's it. Drape yourself up, baby. Oh, come on, let's see those beautiful legs. That's it. Now relax. Beautiful. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right. Give me the pretty girl bit. That's it. Freak out, baby. Come on, that's it, that's it. Oh, sexy. That. Come on, give me more of that. Come on, baby, you can do it. Lovely. Now, you're gettin' me. That's it. That's it, that's beautiful. Oh! Now let's make it really kinky. Undo your dress. Don't be shy. That's it, baby. Take it off. I say, Michael... - Come on, hold it! - That's enough. - Beautiful. Hold it! - That's enough. What are you talking about? Come on, come on... - Now, leave her alone. - We're taking pictures! Just a minute. - Hang on. Wait... - Please, please. We are going. You may be going, mate, but... - What's the matter? Are you mad, sir? - Don't make a scene. What? Come on, ya toffee-nosed prat. Give me that back! What's the matter with you? Go on, get outta here! What the hell's wrong with you? Are you stoned or something? That's a bloody expensive camera! Call an ambulance, get me a blanket. Move! Dr Piper wanted in Casualty immediately, please. Dr Piper in Casualty. Dr De Rougemont in Surgery. Dr De Rougemont in Surgery, please. Steve, how is she? We've saved her sight. And her face? Plastic surgery will help, of course. Oh, my God. You should have let me - assist at the operation. - John, be reasonable. - You were in no condition... - I could have done something. We've done everything we can at this time. All we can do now is to wait. John, they called me. What's happened to Lynn? Are you a relative? I'm Lynn's sister. What's happened? I'm Dr Harris. I'm afraid there's been an accident. A flood lamp crashed into your sister's face. Oh, no. Can I see her? Not at the moment. She's still unconscious. But... Well, is she going to be all right? We're doing everything we can. If you'll excuse me, I must get back. Thank you, Steve. John, how did it happen? Well, the party was getting wild... Lynn, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right. - Come on, now. It's all right. - That nightmare... I know, I know. But it's all right. You're awake now. My nightmare doesn't end when I wake. I think you should have another sleeping tablet. Tablets, pills... Why has he brought us here? Darling, John is trying everything he knows. He hasn't stopped working for a moment since it happened. He loves you. I'm sure that, given time, well... Don't lie to me. You know the truth. It's over. It's not over. - Look, John says that... - Don't. I'm not a child. I'll never regain my looks. That is ridiculous! Perhaps you'd better have a tablet. Leave the bottle here. Please. No, Lynn. You know I can't do that. You mustn't give up so easily. They haven't even started graftings yet. You'll see. Have you any idea how long a process it is? How painful it is? Just try to get some sleep. If I have a tablet, promise me you'll be here when I wake up. I promise. How is she? Well, she's sleeping again, but... I'm worried about her. John, you're becoming obsessed, shut away in here with all these old books. You've got to face facts and get back to your own work. This is my work now. Living tissue can be restored without the pain of continual graftings. Plastic surgeons are only just beginning to rediscover the ground covered by the Egyptians, thousands of years ago. With today's knowledge and modern techniques, there's hope of completely restoring her. You can restore her face, but what about her mental state? John, she just asked me to leave the sleeping tablets with her. I'm afraid she's losing her mind. Have you thought about that? Of course I have! I know what she's going through. Why do you think I'm doing all this? Val, please leave me alone. I must concentrate. Oh, please, John... Val, please leave me alone! Val. I'm sorry. Forgive me? I believe there is hope. Real hope. Thank you, John. I brought you some food, John. Thank you. You haven't had a proper meal for days. Yes... - Is Lynn awake? - Yes. I want to see her. I have some good news for her, at last. Oh, I am glad. She needs cheering up. Well, this should help. Well, what about this? Later. Hello, Lynn. How are you? What have you got there? It's a guinea pig. I reproduced your injuries on her. You deliberately burnt the creature? Why, yes. Oh, John, how can you be so cruel! I had to experiment. Now, listen to me carefully. I found a cure. An entirely new process. Look. The animal's perfectly normal again. Normal? No ill effects, nothing at all. And for me? Would it work, John? Could it? Yes, Lynn. I'm sure of it. Rest, now. Dr Ingram, please. Dr Avery. Dr Jones. Good afternoon, Sir John. Oh! Hello, Bert. You haven't been down here in months. No, I've been away. I believe you have a patient of mine, a young woman. A patient of yours, Sir John? A young woman? No, sir. Unless this one. Miss Alice Webber. That one? Yes, that's her. She's a car accident. Yes, but she was my patient for several months before that. I diagnosed a tumour of the thalamus. I want to make an examination. There's been a slip-up somewhere, then. Dr Harris is booked to do a post-mortem at three. Oh, yes, he can't make it. He asked me to. Very well. - Anything else, sir? - No, thanks, Bert. - Unless you want to help? - Oh, no, sir. Er... it's, er... my lunch break, sir. - You know, sir. Late lunch, sir. - Mm-hmm. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir. He didn't say what he was doing, Doctor, but he did say that you knew all about it, though. - All right, you can go. - Right, sir. Do you realise what you're doing? You've broken every known rule of ethics. And you've seriously jeopardised my post-mortem. She died of a rib piercing the heart. What the devil have you done? I've taken the pituitary. It's opened up a whole new field, Steve. I believe I've discovered an entirely new way of controlling the endocrine system to promote tissue growth. You've found a way of destroying your whole career. Steve, undo me. There's nothing you can say to me that I haven't already said to myself. I know exactly what I'm doing. I should report this, John. I should, but I won't. But if you ever do anything like this again, I'll have to. I mean it, John. I'll report you to the Medical Council. Val, I removed the pituitary gland from the head of the body in the morgue. - Oh! - Leave it. Oh, John, I'll never be any use to you. Val, I wouldn't have asked you to help me, if I wasn't absolutely sure you can do it. Now, I know you can. Raise. Are you all right? You sure? Scalpel. Forceps. Are you all right? Swab. Swab. Forehead. Yes, all right. Swab. This is the most crucial part. I have to cut deep with the laser. She won't bleed much. The computer controls the depth that the laser beam cuts. All right? Swab. Syringe. This contains the fluid that controls tissue growth through the endocrine system. Dressing. John. - Is there anything else I can get? - Ssh... She's sleeping comfortably. I'll stay with her. You get some rest. Her face... What about her face? She'll be all right, Val. Let me stay with her. You get some sleep. Go to bed. All right. Good night. Good night. - Hello! - Dr Harris, how nice to see you. - Do come through. - Oh, thank you. John was very mysterious on the phone. How is he? Very well. And your sister? You'll see. Steve! I'm so glad you could come. For one thing, it means I'm forgiven. And I wanted you to see the new Lynn. Hello, Steve. But... But, it's incredible! May I? Not incredible, but brilliant. It could be the skin of a young child. It is marvellous, isn't it? Steve, will you sit here? John, you must publish. You'll have to tell how you did it. I may well do that. Not before dinner, please. John, it's astonishing. You used the pituitary and the thalamus from that dead girl. Mm-hmm. You took one hell of a risk, John. We don't know enough about the endocrine system yet. How can you be certain of the consequences? It worked. The secretion is functioning normally. Yes, but for how long? - What about side effects? - Steve, I have Lynn back as she was. That's the only thing that interests me. Now all she needs is a complete rest. I thought a sea voyage might do her good. We're going away for a few weeks. Isn't it wonderful? Three weeks cruising in the Caribbean. I envy you. I envy myself. - More brandy? - Mmm, thank you. No more for me, darling. A little for you? Please. Steve, Val will be on her own in London while we're away. Hope you can see something of each other. Well, that'll be a pleasure, of course. Well, here's to a wonderful cruise. - And to your success, John. - Thank you, Steve. May it last. Yes, I know. Would you like some coffee? - I'd love some. - Fine. Hey! You've got a cable. - Cable? - Mm-hmm. It'll be from Lynn and John. Not bad news, I hope? Well, I'm not sure. They're flying home. They'll be here tomorrow. What happened to the remainder of the cruise? I don't know. They've got another ten days to go yet. I hope nothing's gone wrong. - Darling, welcome home. - Don't touch me! - Whatever's the matter? - Matter? Oh, no. Thank you, cabbie. No! No! Why?! Why?! Lynn! Lynn, stop that! I can't bear it! No, I can't! - Lynn! Will you stop it, now! - I can't! - Quiet! - I can't... I can't face life like this. People staring at me, turning away when they see my face. I can't do anything. Go anywhere. You don't know what it's like. Look at me! Look! - I know, I know, darling. - You don't know! How can you know? Oh, John, you've got to do something to help me. You promised. - Yes, all right. All right, come on. - Oh, you promised. Come and sit down. - You promised. - All right. Come on. Everything's going to be all right, Lynn. Trust me. Last time, I used dead tissue. It must be human living tissue. It'll be all right then, darling. I promise you. I love you, Lynn. It's number two, on the first floor. Come on up. Push it, dear. Push. Well, come in, then. I hope you're not thinking of staying the night. You're my last client. It's a fiver. Five pounds? Well, I don't do it for nothing, you know. Oh... of course not. That's it. Well, take your coat off, at least. Just a moment. Hello? Oh, hello, Tanya. No, I've still got company. No, I've had enough for today. Er... Help yourself to a drink. Won't be a minute. You've had some funny ones? You're joking. No, this one's all right. What? No! He... Never! He cm what? A native dance? He did a native dance? Oh! Oh, my God. It's hysterical. A prince? No! Oh, Turkish. Yes, well, there's lots of them about. Yes, I have! Last month! Oh, no, I tell a lie. Wasn't Turkish. Oh, well, I've got to go now. Yes, duty calls. Ring me back in ten minutes. Well, perhaps you'd better make it twenty. All right. Bye, love, speak to you then. Sorry about that. Bloody nuisance she is. Always rings at the wrong moment. Now, where are you going? Now, come on. Not shy, are you? Embarrassed? That's my trouble. You'll get over it, like I did. My regulars, and you do meet some nice men, are always asking me, "What's a nice girl like me doing in this business?" I've had proposals. I can't bear it! I can't bear it! Look at me! Look! Look! Do something! All right. I can't do anything! Go anywhere! You don't know what it's like! How can you know? I can't ask Val to help this time. You'll have to get yourself ready. Who was she? Does it... Does it matter? Will it work? It must work this time, Lynn. It must. Oh, d'ya feel that, d'ya feel it? That's it. Now you got it. Now come on, give me something. Come on. That's it. Beautiful. That's nice. That's it. That's it. Now, look at that glass. Come on. You love it. You love it. That's it, sweetheart. Oh, that's it. Oh, my, have you got it made after that. Ain't that the one? Come on, one more. Now, take the drink away. That's it. Beautiful. Hold that. Right. Go and get changed and then we'll have a drink. Lynn! Ha... That's fantastic, Lynn! Hey, baby. Look at that. Hey, that doctor's a genius. Glad you think so. So, when do we start work? I thought you'd given up your career. I must work. I've gotta prove something. - To the doctor? - To myself. So, I'm not leaving until you give me the okay. Well, I tell you what, er... let's talk about it over lunch, hmm? Can't make lunch. I'm gonna meet Val and go shopping. Well, dinner, then? Oh. Hmm. Still the doctor? Yeah, well, look, Lynn, this, er... this comeback bid. Comeback? What are you talking about? But you don't think you can carry on from where you left off, do you? It's your doctor who's the genius, baby. Not me. Look, Lynn, you've been off the scene so many months. But that's ridiculous. It was only a few months ago that... - Listen, Lynn. - No, you listen. Look at my face. It's as good as it ever was. Give me some bookings and, in a few weeks, I'll be back exactly where I was. Back where you were? Listen, baby, where you were, I put you there. And don't you forget that. And the day you blew me out, baby, you blew the whole scene, 'cause you were washed up, finished. I made you! You think you made me? It was me that made you, sweetheart. My face! Who are you? Cameras, lights, lens. The only thing that you ever had was me! My face! Hello, darling. I spent an absolute fortune. It looks like it. Here, let me take those. Oh, Val, before I forget, Steve rang you. - He wants you to call him back. - Oh, good! You come and rest, darling. Phew! What a day. Oh! Do you know, a man tried to pick me up today. Said I was one of the most beautiful women he'd ever seen. Is that supposed to make me jealous? No. Proud! Oh, hello. After all, it's the beauty you gave to me. And I'm very grateful. Bought you a present. - Which one? - This one. Open it. Since you won't let me work anymore, I thought you should be the one to photograph me. You'd prefer that, wouldn't you? I don't want to call Mike again, although he has called me. That's fine, Steve. Bye-bye. The other equipment's coming later. - What other equipment? - Lights, everything. We must take pictures that we can both be proud of. After all, I am your masterpiece. Quite right. We can never be grateful enough. What did Steve want? He's coming to pick me up for dinner about eight. Oh, that's nice. He asked how you were. I told him you were all right now. What did you tell him? Well, I told him about Lynn's setback. - Was I wrong? - No, of course not, darling. Why shouldn't Steve know? I mean, he's practically one of the family now, isn't he? Well, I don't know about that. I'm sure of it. Come on, darling. Let's try on those new dresses. Taking up a new hobby? No, it's an idea of Lynn's. She lives for cameras. How is she? Val said there'd been a setback. Nothing serious. Val worries too much. Slight epidermis infection, that's all. It's a tricky business you've taken on, John. I've been reading up on it. Seems Keppering in Germany tried something similar. His methods had no lasting effect. I read the medical journals, too. Over a lengthy period of treatment, his patients suffered enormous mental pressure from constant repetition. Keppering's theory is a little dated. - Do you intend to publish your findings? - Eventually, yes. I think it's your duty to, John. And, what's more... - All ready? - Hello, Val. - You're looking very nice, Lynn. - Thank you. Well, the, er... the Armstrongs are expecting us at eight, so I think we'd better get going. - Good night, Lynn. - Good night. Good night. Have a nice time. - Sorry to rush off like this. - That's all right. We won't be late. It's not very far. - Good night, John. - See you later, Val. Perhaps we can continue our talk some other time, then. Good night. Good night, John. - What's the matter, darling? - It's about that girl. It says, "New clues in headless girl murder. "Police believe killer had medical knowledge." - Well, look. - No, I don't want to look. It's just a filler piece. No news, so the editor rehashes an old story. But they... they must know something. They've established that medical knowledge was used in the killing. Darling, you know what papers are. Journalese. It means nothing. Forget it. Forget it! Darling, why don't we go down to the cottage at Seaford? Stay a week or so. Or however long we need. It would be nice to get away. Well? - There is some degeneration. - Oh. But it doesn't show. Not to the naked eye. How long before it does show? A week. - A little longer, perhaps. - A week? That's plenty of time to prepare another operation, now the equipment's arrived. I can't do it, Lynn. Not again. What do you mean? I'm sworn to preserve life, not take it. You're sworn to one thing. I could never forget that. But it's not necessary to operate again. Not necessary? I love you, Lynn. I want to marry you. Now. Why? Guilt? Pity? Don't ever pity me, John. Do you think I could ever be happy being tolerated, pitied? Lynn... I love you, too. I'm utterly dependent on you, and I want to feel safe with you. But the scar would always be there, reminding us. I want to be able to forget. It's the only way it could work for us. It really is. Oh, Lynn. Do you know that Val phoned today? Why, no. How was she? Terribly excited. Steve's asked her to marry him. Isn't that wonderful news? Why, yes. Aren't you happy about it? Yes, of course I am, for them. I'm not quite so happy about Steve being so close to us. Gin, darling? No. I prefer Scotch, please. Darling. Look. Come over here. What? On the beach. The girl. See the rucksack? She must be a hitchhiker or something. Such a shame. Appears to be all alone. Darling, why don't you go down and talk to her? So, you know, it seemed like a good idea. Well, you know all that stuff about "freedom of the road" and that. I, you know, took off. It didn't work out, though. Not really. Freedom? I mean, I was what was free. You know, this crowd, I mean, they're okay, but... You know, I... I didn't like being shared out. I mean, basically, I'm a one-man girl. I learned that, you know. That's educational, that's useful to know. Thanks. Beatniks is okay, but frankly, you know, none of them seemed too clean to me. You've no family, then? Not really. There's a goofy aunt somewhere. You know what I was thinking, when your husband came up to chat me, I was thinking of the sea, of swimming out there, except I can't swim for toffee, and forgetting about everything. You know, like striking out for Ireland, or some place that never existed. - But you'd have drowned. - That's what I mean, you know. Then up comes your husband and I think, "Well, he's making a pass." Like this, "My wife and I would be delighted if you'd join us for lunch" bit. I thought, "Yeah, well, first, there's not gonna be any wife, "and, second, lunch is gonna be served in bed." Then why did you come? I figured, what the hell. At least he's clean. I'm glad you didn't. Didn't? Swim away from us, I mean. Be nice if you could stay a while. Hey, you mean that? Great! Um... Do you mind, I mean. You know, could I have a little more of that ham? Of course. No, Lynn! Not this kid, not her! Why? She's young. She's got her whole life before her. So have I! She's perfect. No family, no friends, no-one knows where she is. The other one, she was a prostitute. Her life was a mess. Anyway, that's the way I tried to justify killing her. But not this kid. She said she'd kill herself anyway. She made the decision. At least this way her death would be useful. You can justify that, can't you? No, Lynn. I can't. Not her. I won't do it. All right, then. If you won't, then I will. - Lynn! - I mean it. I'll kill her! - I'll kill her! - Quiet, Lynn! Shut up! Shut up, Lynn! Shut up, you bitch. She must have heard us. She's gone! What? Oh! Fixed myself a sandwich. I hope you don't mind. No, not at all. Oh, sorry about the nightie. Sort of fits where it touches. - Is anything wrong? - Good night, Terry. Good night. Rik! Rik! Yeah. - Here, come in the window. - Right. Now listen, Rik, I don't like this set-up. It's creepy. Let's have the milk. What do you mean "creepy"? - He was in my room earlier. I... - So? Okay, but with his wife here? - Maybe they're swingers. - No, it's more than that. He keeps watching me. Everywhere I go, I see... I see his eyes staring at me. I don't like it. Never mind about that. Where's the stuff? Haven't had a chance to look round. I've told you, he keeps watching me. She must have some jewellery somewhere, but I've only ever seen her in a swimsuit, and who wears jewellery in a swimsuit? Listen, Georgie reckons this is a great set-up. Remote house, they don't have friends calling. Georgie says we can make plenty of bread here, but only if you do your job right. I don't care what Georgie says. I don't like it. I'm not staying, Rik. - Now, listen... - Ssh! - Whatcha doing? - I'm getting out. - Georgie won't like that. - I'd sooner face Georgie than him. - Now, hang on. - Hey, let me go, Rik. No! There's not that much of a hurry, is there? No, Rik, not now. No, let me go. But it's weeks since we've been near a bed. No, no, Rik, no. - We'll be out of here before morning. - Please. I'm scared. No. Oh... Oh, Rik... Ooh... Rik... Terry! Breakfast's ready. Terry? - What's the matter? - Well, the door's locked. Just a minute. Terry? Terry? Terry! Terry! I got in through the window. It's wide open. She's really gone this time. What are we gonna do? You must operate, soon! Seaford! Brighton train calling at Lewes. Brighton train. Close the doors. Close the doors, please. Blimey! It's my station! 'Scuse me, guv'nor. Close the doors! Close the doors! Here you are, madam. Not this one, porter. I'd like a non-smoker, please. - There's one here, madam. - Thank you. Blood. The porter saw it, and when they find the body, he'll remember me. Let's get away from here, quickly. Steve, are you sure? I tell you, I heard it on my car radio. A headless body found under the seat of a train. - At Seaford? - On the line from Seaford. Val, it's too much of a coincidence. First here in London, and Lynn makes an astonishing recovery. They go off to Seaford and it happens again. Both bodies headless, and the glands John needs for the operation - are in the skull. - Don't. Please, don't. He must be mad. Val, he was always obsessed with Lynn. She can't know what he's doing! We'll have to get down there right away and get her away from him. She's suffered too much already to be involved in this. Is there a train? There's a pretty regular service to Seaford. One about every hour. I'll check. No, no. You get the taxi. I'll call the station. Lynn... Lynn! Lynn! Lynn. Lynn, I... I'll have to wait till tomorrow. Why? Look at my hands. I can't. I can't afford to wait. You must do it now. Lynn, I can't. Relax. Have you prepared the gland? No... No, I haven't. Then do it now. For me. All right, Lynn. Hi! I came back. It was Terry! She saw it! Stop her! If you drink at this rate, you won't be fit to operate tomorrow. Please, John, I need you. What for? To kill? To kill some more? How many times must I kill? We have what we need. Just once more! And then again... and again. No, Lynn. I can't. It's over. I won't do it! John, I beg you. No. No, Lynn! All right. I'll call the police. - The police? - Yes! I'll tell them you're mad. Who do you think they'll believe? You or me? I don't care, Lynn. I believe I am mad. Look what I've... what I've done... for you. You call the police. What was that? Call the police? Call the fuzz? What the hell are you doing here? Groper, the phone. Rik. Sandy. You wanted the phone. You enjoyed that, didn't you? He's like an animal. Does what he's told. No questions. Not responsible, are you, Groper? If I tell him to hurt something, he does it. He enjoys hurting things. Now... We don't want any trouble, do we? She's not in there, Georgie. Try the other one. Hey, have you seen that lot in there? What's all that, then? My, er... husband is a doctor. He does research work. Oh, he's a doctor, Georgie. I bet he does a few snide operations on the quiet in there, eh? More their mark. Terry said you was a little darling. She was right. Oh, you're... Terry's friends? Then that explains it. Explains what? She said she ran away from filth. I should have recognised you at once! Do you hear that, Rik? Hear how your wife talks about you? Played her part well, then, didn't she? Where is she? - Terry your wife? - Mmm. She came yesterday, and spent the day. Then left. Taking my husband's wristwatch with her. What time did she cutout? Cut out? Go. Leave! Well, I've no idea. Um... Sometime after dinner, wasn't it, John? Liar. You are, you know. Because, at two a.m., you caught her gettin' a glass of milk and a sandwich. Do something, John! Do something! Yeah, go on, Johnnie, do something! Yeah. Get out! Get out! Terry left here last night because you frightened her. I frightened her even more. So, she came back. Terry was casing the pad for us. We were gonna turn you over. Where is she? Where is Terry? Get out! Get out! Leave us! Leave us! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Oh, Galahad's woken up. The girl... she did come back. - Well, where is she now? - I don't know! I'll tell you! I'll tell you! I'll tell! Groper! My husband made a fool of himself with her, so I threw her out. That's more like it. Well, Terry wouldn't look at him! She's looked at everybody else. All right, - turn the pad over. - Great! There's no need to destroy the place, is there? Groper! All right, then, show us where the bread is. Money, jewellery, valuables. Come on, do you want to show us? In the bedroom. - Lynn! - Groper, watch him! Yes! Cool it! Turnin' over's half the fun. What's this, then? It's a laser. Oh. Well, I'll settle for the jewellery. - You can help me, Georgie. - Yeah? Where's the stuff? I'm in need of urgent medical treatment. From me? An operation on my face. My husband refuses to do it. Why? Well, that doesn't matter, but what does matter is that you can help me by making him do it. - Why should I? - Oh! Money. You want my jewellery. I've none here. I've... I've lots in London. Take this. Take it. I've lots more, I promise you. I'll give you anything, anything. But help me. That's better. Now, what's wrong with your face? Ten... shun! Here, I'm hungry. Anybody else for food? Yeah. I fancy a touch of the picnics. Don't you, Groper? Yeah. Yeah. Stand easy. I'll see what's in the fridge. No! You keep out of there! You don't mean you'd begrudge food to a weary traveller? How did you get on? Do you get anything good? Hey... A right bastard, he is. He's a doctor, all right. You know what he did? Smashed her face up. Ruined her looks. - Her face looks all right to me. - Yeah, comes on suddenly. Something to do with the tissue. I've got news for you, Doc. You're going to operate. Don't be a fool. She's explained it to me. Now, you get your needle, and get started. You don't know what you're talking about. I've nothing prepared, anyway! - Well, get it prepared. - I can't! You wanna bet? Groper! Bring him in here. What's that, then? Pre-med. Anaesthetic. Mainlining for real? Go on. Watch him. It's a hea... It's a girl... It's a head. It's a girl's... head. Oh, it's horrible... If he did that, what's he done with Terry? Oh, get me out of here, Georgie! - It's horrible! Get me out of here. - No, Georgie. Not till you find out what he's done with Terry. I'll find out. That nutter's gonna talk. Groper! Get him! Now, you murdering lunatic, where's Terry? She's dead. Dead? Don't tell me you didn't know about it. He killed her. He killed her. I swear I had nothing to do with it. He killed her. She'd swear anything. You killed my wife? My Terry? Well, where is she? Where is she?! Where is she?! She's on the beach. Terry. You... I'll kill you, you bastard! - No! Don't harm him! - Leave it! Don't! He killed her! - Don't! Don't, don't! - Leave it! I'll tell you. I'll show you where she is. Rik, you go with her. I'll settle with this one. When I come back, you will make him operate, won't you, Georgie? - You promised me, you promised me. - Yeah. Come. Groper! You raving lunatic. You tell me everything! Well, where is she, then? Where'd you leave her? Down there, amongst the rocks. Just by the Point. Where? I can't see her. There. Look. Can you see? No. Just to the foot of the cliff. Why don't you relax? Groper, no! Well? - Where's Rik? - Rik? On the beach. I left him there with Terry. With Terry, John, with Terry. It was awful. The... The tide was coming in. We had to pull her out of the water, the water. Did you go in the water? - Of course, I was in the water. - Well, why aren't you wet? - I was on the beach. I was on the beach. - You bloody liar! - No! - No! Groper, no! Take Sandy and get the cops, the pair of ya. Don't worry about me, get the cops. Sit down. - Terry was in the water, John... - Shut up! Save it for the coppers. Tell your lousy lies to them. You're mad! You're both raving nuts! Doctor! What are you doing? Come away from there. You'll kill us all! Let me go! Let me go! What are you doing? Get away from me! Lynn! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Help me. Help me! Oh, that wink's beautiful! Jan! Jan, come here, I've got it. Jan, come here. Jan. Jan'.! John! Lynn. Hello, darling. - I thought you'd never get here. - I'm so sorry. I was more tired than I thought. - Mike! - Huh? Oh, wait a minute, sweetheart, huh? Hello, Lynn. Mike. Mike, this is John Rowan. John, Mike. - How do you do? - Hello. The man whose camera made me famous. Hey, Kate! Fix the man a drink. He said, "you sold your soul for a mess of pottage." What's pottage? Oh, it's a staple diet. - Have you ever been to Texas? - Been to New York. - I did an operation there. - You're a doctor! How's your kiss of life? Lynn, I've had a heavy day. I have to operate again in the morning, - Can we slip away now? - Me! Don't be a hang-up, Kate. If I'm gonna photograph anyone, I'm gonna photograph you, baby. - May we go, please? - Don't let's spoil the party, darling. "Don't let's spoil the party, darling." - Come on, baby. - Okay, Mike. Okay, baby. Come on, let's show 'em, huh? That's it. Oh, that's beautiful, baby. That's really great. That's it. Now, let's make it really kinky. Undo your dress. Take it off. I say, Michael, that's enough- - Come on, hold it-Hold it. What are you talking about? Come on, come on. Leave her alone. We're taking pictures. Just a minute. Hang on. Come on, ya toffee-nosed prat. Give me that back. That's a bloody expensive camera!
