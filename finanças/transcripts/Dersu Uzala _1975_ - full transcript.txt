KORFOVSKAYA - Looking for something? - Yes, a grave. No one's had time to die here yet. You can see there is no graveyard. Well, this was a long time ago. Perhaps not so long ago. Nearly three years. I buried a friend here. A good friend. Huge trees stood here. A cedar and a fir tree. Remember them? Probably chopped down when the settlement was built. Could it be those? Dersu... DERSU UZALA In the islands, the hunter Roams all day long But no luck for him And he curses himself What's he going to do? How is he to serve? He cannot be cheerful So what He'll try to aim better So the hunter goes to warmer waters Where the fish were frolicking, in the beautiful weather There on the shore That year, my mission was to go through the Shkotov area, in the Ussuri Region, in order to make a topographical survey of the country. Sometimes the mountains, and the forest can be pleasant, even welcoming. Sometimes though, they can be silent and forbidding. This wasn't just a personal feeling, every man in the survey section felt the same way. "God helps those, who help themselves." Why we don't camp here for the night, Tomorrow we may find a better place. - All right, I guess we can camp here. - Yes, we'll stay here for the night. This valley reminded me of a painting that I once saw, the "Witches' Sabbath." I could almost imagine them coming on their broomsticks. - What was that? - I heard a stone falling. Somebody's coming this way. Maybe a bear! No shoot! Me a man! Hello, Captain! Look. A man. You said it was a bear. Won't you join us? Thank you, Captain. Me very hungry. Nothing eating all day long. Alright, what are you? Chinese? - Korean? - People called "Gold". Are you a hunter? Me hunter man. Hunt all time. No other work. Nothing. Where do you live? Me no home, nothing. In mountains, me got little hut. Sleep there. Good enough for me. No luck today? Today me shoot at deer. He ran away, not dead, only wounded. Me chase that deer. Me see some man tracks. Me walk after slow, and wonder what men doing so far in mountains. Me look careful. Captain there, soldiers there. And so me, me come along. Why did you miss the stag if you’re such a good hunter? You never miss? We're soldiers. We're not supposed to miss. Then you, must be great hunter! You shoot everything. Leave for others, nothing. Hey you, enough talking! Alright, alright. Good, be quiet. We can talk now. My name's Arsenyev, I'm a soldier. - You tell me yours. - Dersu Uzala. And how old are you? How old, me not know. Me live a long, long time. Your family? Family, all dead. Long ago, me had a wife. Son and baby girl. Get smallpox and now they all dead. Live only me. Only Dersu alive Look, Dersu. We are surveying this area, the ranges, passes and rivers. Will you be our guide? - Necessary me think. - All right, all right. You think it over. Now, let's go to sleep. The next day, Dersu took his place at the head of of our squad. Here, trail go here! - Here's a trail! - Hey, there's a trail! Good work. Along here, two, three days ago man walking here. Big rain fall then. Tracks of Chinese. How do you find out that? How you not understand? Look well! Chinese boot track. Look, look water in tracks. He's right. You the same as children. Got eyes but do not see. You live in the forest, die soon Chinese! Come on! Forward! - Real soon now, we gonna find hut. - How do you know that? Look! Strip bark. Make roof. The rain-soaked ashes, the bed of grass, and a discarded piece of Chinese fabric, all confirmed Dersu's words. A Chinese had certainly spent the night here very recently. Did you see that? Ivan! Captain, rice, salt, matches me want please. What for? Rice, salt, matches. Wrap in birch bark, put in hut. - Do you plan to return? - Not come back, no sir. Others come this way. Find dry wood there. Food to eat. Not die. Olentiev! Come over here. - Bring some matches, rice and salt. - Yes sir. I couldn't help admiring him. He was so wise. He had a deep knowledge born of a lifetime spent in the forest. He was goodhearted, generous minded. He provided for the needs of a person he didn't know, and probably wouldn't ever see. Dersu, let's wait until the rain stops. Time to get ready. Listen good. Birds are starting to sing? Rain soon stop. Sun is coming out soon. - Dersu, do you know what the sun is? - Sun, sure, everyone know sun. You never seen him? You just take look. There he is in sky with moon! Captain, sun very important fellow, strong. If he die one day, we all die! Moon too, another important fellow. That bad fellow, noisy. If one listens to you, everything around are fellows. Look. All are fellows. Water alive. Well, you said it. Is fire alive too? Yes, fire is strong fellow. Fire angry, forest burn for many days. When he get angry, you dead, water get angry, you dead, wind get angry, you dead! Fire, water, wind, three strong fellows! That day, it snowed for the first time. - Why shoot? - Just for fun. You waste bullet for nothing. What waste? We're soldiers. We're practicing. Sharpshooter, it's my day! Sharpshooter, ha? All right! It's harder than bringing down a flying bird. - Good shooter not miss. - That's right. Go ahead, old man. Try it yourself. Why shoot and smash? Why break? Where in forest you find bottle? All right, don't try to get out of it. Just admit you can't hit hit it. Me not hit bottle, me shoot at string. Bottle fall down, you give me bottle. If you shoot the string, the bottle is yours, and I will fill it with vodka. Make way for Willhelm Tell. All right! - Did see you that? - He certainly put one over on you, Olentiev! Get ready now, men! We're moving out. - Where is Dersu? - God knows. He took his portion of vodka and took off. - He's sitting by the river. - What's he doing? Sitting by the fire and singing. Probably drunk. Mind if I sit with you for a while, Dersu? Captain, over there, my wife, kids all dead. Smallpox. Everyone afraid of smallpox. So wife, kids, home, me burn everything. Me, not sleep good last night. Me had bad dream. Me see hut. Soon hut fall down. In dream, wife and kids, got no food, freezing. Me come here to get them food for them Yesterday, an old man walked along, all alone. Stay here at night, sleep. - How do you know that? - Close to fire, see traces, where he sleep. How do you know that he's old? Young man always walk on toes, old man always walk on flat of heel. A few days later, I met this old Chinese man. His name is Li SungBinn. Sixty four year old. He come from Tientsin. And what's he doing here? He have woman, very beautiful. His brother take her. He went into the mountains, for 40 years live alone. Thank you. It's getting colder. Maybe we should invite him over to the fire. No, no, Captain. Don't disturb him. Now he think very much. He see house, he see garden... all in blossom. Captain! Captain! Li Sung Binn want say goodbye. Him now go home. The ultimate goal of this expedition was to explore the region of Lake Khanka. To get there, we would have to cross huge marshes with no trails. I sent most of the men and horses to Chernigovka, Dersu, Olentiev, Krushinov and myself headed toward the lake in a flatboat. Olentiev, stay here and make camp. Dersu and I will go on. Unload the stuff. Captain! We go back soon? Me very scared. Lake Khanka is not far. We won't stay there long. Me do what you say, but keep eye open. You say alright, Dersu say alright. Silence lay over the frozen reaches of the Lake. Some menace to humans was lurking in this silence. Captain! We have to go back quick. The wind cover our tracks. All right, Dersu. Don't worry, Dersu. It's nothing, we'll soon find out the way we came. That way! Captain, we not come this way. Bad! Captain, we lose road! Road there. But how do we get there? Water's all around. Captain, Sun is low. Soon night come. Night come, we die. If the camp is close by, they'll hear us. We'll have to spend the night here, Dersu. It's dangerous to go on. What shall we do? Captain, listen, listen good. Have to work fast. We not work fast, we die. - Work at what? - Cut grass. Captain! Work good! No stop! Captain! Captain! Captain! Work! Captain! Got to hold grass in place. Take rope! Captain! Captain! Get up, get up! As the wind howled, I sank into darkness. I don't know how long I slept. Captain! Captain! Hey, you no bear. Come out! Sun is up! Only then did I realize what Dersu had done for me. His wits had saved me. Thank you, Dersu, thank you. What would I have done without you? Go together, work together. No need for thanks. That's Olentiev! From that point on, our expedition became more difficult. Forward, forward. Cold, fatigue, hunger... Man is too small, before the face of nature. Forward, forward, keep it moving! Forward! Captain, me smell smoke. Ussuri people cooking fish. Thank you. Captain. Where we go tomorrow? We'll head for Chernigovka. The men are waiting for us there. Then we take the train to Vladivostok. Come with us. It's nice and comfortable in town. Sorry, me cannot. Not for me. Town no good. Dersu can't hunt in town. Hunt for sable, no can do. At least come to the station with me. I'll get food and some money for you there. Help you a little. Me do not need food or money. Captain, me go hunt for sable now. Sable is like money to hunter. What is it, Dersu? Me, bad man. - No, no, no! - No! no! Captain. Me only need bullets to shoot. You are welcome. Olentiev! - Yes. - Give him everything that's left. Thank you, Captain. Me, tomorrow, me walk alone. Four suns go. Daubikhe first, then Ulakhe, then Fujin. Me hear, there many sable there. Many deer too. Me hear you talk of train. Me no understand. Now me understand. Goodbye, good fellows! Farewell. Goodbye, Dersu! One day maybe we'll meet again. Goodbye, Captain. Dersu! Goodbye, Dersu! I wish you the best. I hope we'll meet again. Me hope so. He's a good man, isn't he? I never met anyone like him before. He's something rare. Godbless him. In the islands, the hunter Roams all day long But no luck for him And he curses himself What’s he going to do How is he to serve He cannot be cheerful So what He’ll try to aim better So the hunter goes to warmer waters Captain! Dersu! In spring 1907, I traveled again to the Ussuri Region. Where are you going? Go! To the left! Careful! Look after the horses! We spent three months in the wilds. Spring gave way to summer. We’ve explored a large area. But if Dersu had been with us, we would've explored a lot more. All the time I kept hoping, that I'd meet up with him again. Where are you, Dersu? Go on, back up the stream! Go on! Go! Can't you move any faster? We are moving fast as fast we\can, we have to go back to the stream! Andriucha! Throw up more branches! Put some water on the fire. Faster, faster! Vladimir Arsenievich, I met a hunter two miles from here. He was asking about our unit. Who we are, who the captain is. - Did you tell him anything? - No, I didn't, Captain. We're under military secrecy. Oh, Turtygin, Turtygin! Is he still over there? No, he's not. He started to pack up his kit in a great hurry. - Vladimir Arsenievich! Your rifle! - I won't need it... - Dersu! - Captain! Captain! - It is you, Captain! - How are you, Dersu! My dear friend. Haven't changed. Haven't grown older. You, my eagle with blue-black wings, Where've you been for so long? I flew high over the mountains, - Where peace and quiet reign... - How have you been? It's been a long time. Shot lots of sables? - Plenty. Plenty of money too. - That's good! Only Dersu lose the money. - No more money. - How come? Merchant ask me to his house. Much vodka. Me give all money to merchant to look after. After that, me could not find him. Why he be that way? You, my eagle with blue-black wings, Where've you been for so long? I flew high over the mountains, Where peace and quiet reign... Next morning, the forest was shrouded in thick fog. We were leading the way. I was confident because Dersu was now with me. Dersu, what do you think? Will the weather clear soon? It clear very soon. Earth and hill all sweating now. Soon they'll get completely well. Why are they lagging behind? They should have caught up by now. Let's wait here. Me lost pipe, Captain. Me think pipe be near. Must go back. How me lose pipe like that? Dersu getting old. Or Dersu's head not working like it should. Captain! Look, Captain! That is track of tiger! He walk alone here behind us. When we come here, was not track on road. He very close. When Dersu stop back there, he very close. We go along this way, he go along too. That is nothing, Captain. Tiger never make big noise. Excuse us, Captain, we're a bit late. Too many horses got bogged in the marshes. Is this your pipe, Dersu? - What's the matter? - There's a tiger around. Watch out, men! There's a tiger nearby. Keep alert! Watch your steps! Come on, come on, come on. Tiger still follow our trail. Why you follow us, like that? Why you do that, what you want, tiger? Why you do like that. We go along our way. We not bother you. We not hunt you. Why you follow us? You not got enough room in forest, tiger? Forward! What are you stopping for? Looks like fallen trees there. - Dersu, what's this? - Loudieva. - Loudieva? What's that? - Animals go down there to drink. Then, when animal go around barrier, fall into trap. They catch animals, sell the skins. Detail several men to follow me. Belonozhkin, Zagursky, Zakharov, Bochkaryov, follow me! come on! Watch out! Captain. Look here. Check on the other traps. Come on, go. Captain! There's a deer and a couple there. Already dead. Pasha, what do you have there? I found two more traps. Nothing alive in either. - How about you, Andrei? - I just fell into one! - Vas, Vas? - What is it? - Find anything? - It's a real butcher's shop over here. - Who did this? - Bad Chinese do that. Why trap not looked at? Not right way to hunt. Kill animals for nothing is bad! Go get the axes and shovels. - What's going on, Dersu? - Hunhutsi. Chinese bandits, Captain! Hunhutsi, make hole in Dersu's shirt. Me make holes in theirs! - How many are there? - Eight. Turtygin, two remain here. The rest of you follow me They've gotten away! Hunhutsi, bad Chinese, very bad! Steal all money, steal furs too. Steal women, murder all the men! Dersu! Look at this, Captain. Dersu! Hunhutsi steal three young women. Where they put men? Me not understand. Turtygin! Hey, guys! Come over here quick! Much mosquito, horsefly there. By night your face like this. Then much pain. Then die. Good we found at daytime. Very good. All still alive. Very lucky. Those murderous Hunhutsi, I'll shoot the lot of them! There they are! That Tchjan Bao, not Hunhutsi! My name is Tchjan Bao. We're fighting the Hunhutsi. I'm Arsenyev. We're exploringthis region. - Nice to meet you. - A pleasure. They torture the men and steal the women. Hunhutsi go that way! Come, hurry! Dersu, don't worry. They won't get far. Will you take care of the men? All right! Fall in, men! I heard it reported there are no more than ten bandits. - We can handle them. - Well, good luck then. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Soon be over. Hunhutsi good as dead. At first sight, this river seemed quiet and peaceful. I sent some men with horses to look for a place to ford it. I myself with the others tried to cross the river on a raft. - Get to the other side, there. - Yes, sir! Give me your hand, wait. Pass over the rifles. We lost the poles! Throw over a pole, quick! Come on! Do it! Keep moving! Go along the bank! Along the bank! Run along the bank! Keep going, get ahead of us! Get ahead of us! - Jump, Captain! Jump! - Hurry! Dersu! Dersu! - If only we had a rope! - We used it all to make the raft. Cut the tree, cut down tree! - This one? - No! - This one? - No! - This one? - Yes! Get the axes, quick! Tie rope to tree, quick! Tie rope to tree! Your belts, hurry! These will do too. - We'll need levers. - Cut them! Hold on, hold on! Come on, guys, faster, faster! There's not a second to lose! Hurry! Hold on, Dersu! Are you ready? Let it out, let it out, That's the way! Easy now, easy, that's way. Now, pull! Pull! That's it! Here we go! When rain like this, Captain, autumn come. Right, that's fine. A little to the left, to the left. Yeah, that's fine. Are you ready? Hold it! Here we go! I got it! Turtygin! Come over here and take a picture of us now. Yeah, press here, okay? My fondest memories of Dersu, tare linked with the beginning of autumn. - What's wrong with that horse? - Tiger. Listen, tiger! Soldiers got guns, they shoot. Better you go, you go now! No! Tiger bad hurt! - He ran away, he's not dead, Dersu. - No! Tiger run away, he run till he die. Now me bad frightened. Don't be scared, Dersu. A dead tiger can't harm you. Kanga going to send another tiger after Dersu. Kanga is the spirit of the forest worshipped by the Gold people. From that day Dersu changed. He became morose and irritable. What you do? That sign say no ginseng here. You break sign... People search for ginseng in forest, find nothing. You bad man. You throw meat in fire, why you do that? Meat thrown into fire, lost. Tomorrow, other fellows sit here. They find no meat, only burned thing, so they do not eat. Who would come here? - Many fellows. - Who? Weasel come here, woodchuck come here, crow come here too, birds be here. Many other fellows, yes. Reporting for duty, Dersu! Turtygin is at your service! Autumn in the Ussuri region is short, it gets cold very quickly. I started getting ready for winter, and sent some of the men with all our horses to Olga Bay. Wait! Fellows here! - What fellows? - Wild boar. I don't smell anything. - Dersu, why didn't you shoot? - Me not see them. Captain, why me no see wild boar? My nose see better than eyes. I didn't know at the time that this small incident was a tragic warning sign. An animal! Where, Captain? Where? Over there, over by that fallen tree. - Did I hit it? - No. Didn't you see it? Even the best marksmen misses sometimes, Dersu. Why Dersu miss? Why me miss deer? Captain, always me see animal first, always me shoot. Always Dersu never miss. Always. He miss now. Eyes gone bad. How me going to live now in forest? Dersu. Come to Khabarovsk with me. My home is your home. New Year's Eve came. It was a strange night. Dersu! Dersu! Tiger come back to kill me!. - Me thank you, Captain! Me thank. - What's the matter, Dersu? Captain, you say "my home your home", me thank you, Captain! - Me thank you, Captain! Me thank. - What's the matter, Dersu? Captain, you say "my home your home", me thank you, Captain! - So you'll come? - Bad eyes not work so good. Kanga spirit no want me here. He send me tiger. I suspect what Dersu called the tiger was a manifestation of his fear of the forest, conjured by the imagination of a man grown old. KHABAROVSK Listen here. Vova recorded Dersu. Lets hear. Captain, he go to mountains and work. Come back home. Sit down at table, write, work. Me, in big town, no work. Me look at fire. Look at hills far away. And that's it. He's right. Town life is no good for him. DNever mind. He'll get used to it. - Vova, did Dersu hear that? - Yes. What did he say? He said, "Him talk plenty good. He not miss out nothing." - Does he often talk to you about the forest? - Yes. Dersu's not afraid of anything, not wolves or wild boars or bears... Blizzards, nor rivers, nor floods. You know, Dersu is Vova's hero. He's crazy about him. I'd have died many times if it hadn't been for him. He never mentioned that. Well, he doesn't think it something to talk about. There are lots of others who would brag about such things, and they always exaggerate. You see, this stick fellow, we have many many years walking together in forest. And this tooth fellow, bear tooth, bear. This claw, And this, claw of lynx. For you. Take. You give it to me, Dersu? Yes, my little captain. You mean it? I am so grateful! It will be my talisman. Hey, do you have tiger claws as well? Did you ever hunt for tiger? No, me shoot at tiger once. It bad to kill tiger. Why? Very... very bad. - Take this. Thank you. - Thank you. Why give money for water? Much water is in river. - Why you take money for water? - What's wrong with you, savage? You are bad man! - Where are you going? - To shoot. But you must'nt. You're not allowed to shoot in towns. In barrel of gun, much dirt. Me shoot bullet, clean barrel. Then wipe with cloth, shoot well. There are many people there. It's dangerous. Me not shoot at people, me shoot at sky. But it's not allowed. The town is not the mountain. Do you understand? You mustn't. Well, how are you, Dersu? Me sitting here, me like dead log. Me no understand, how you live inside box. Well, I must agree, it isn't a very nice room. I suppose we could change the wallpaper... Make it more comfortable. In the meantime, you can move into my office. No thanks, Captain. Me, go outside, make good tent. Sleep there, not bother no one. Well, you see, Dersu... In a town, that's not allowed. Why not? Not good? How can I explain to you. It's the law. A law. Shooting guns not allowed, sleep in tent not allowed. Me not breathe. Need fresh air. - Papa! it's terrible, Dersu's been arrested! - The police just called. What happened? Well, you see, he saw me going out to buy wood, and he got very angry, and he went off to cut down a tree in the park. Captain! Please, me want to go away. Me can't live in town, got to go away. - Where do you want to go? - Me go, back to mountain. Captain! Mrs! Little captain, you are all good fellows. Me go, me bad! Sorry, me cannot live in town. Very well, take this rifle with you. It's a gift. The sight on it is very good. Even with bad eyesight you won't miss. Here. Thank you, Captain.
