--== McEphie ==-- -Oh, Vince! -My aunt looks so sexy! James, when will you quit basketball? I'll take care of you... As long as you'll take care of my thesis this summer. Hey, your cousin's stealing your girl! Stop it! Are you happy now, Vince? You took everything away from me. You did nothing but bring trouble. When are you going to shape up? The university officials found James guilty of plagiarism. Belinda, James cannot get suspended. One more failed subject, and he won't be able to graduate. Three seconds left! We're losing because of James! Mom, it wasn't my fault! They were insulting Dad. Emman should have been the one expelled. -He started it. -Stop. Of course that wasn't caught on camera. Now everyone's against me. James, I suggest you stay with your grandmother in the province. Stay there for a while. We've arranged everything. What? I don't want to go to the province, Mom. Just bring me there to New York. I'll stay with you. Son, we can't afford it. You know that I'm here to work. I can't take care of you here. James, do this for your mom. I'm really having a hard time right now. Mom. Losing your father and not being able to mourn him because... Because he left a hefty amount of debt. Please don't add to my problems. I can handle myself. Don't you trust me? (For the unchosen ones.) Hey! Ready, Pat? Buy one snow cabbage, take one snow cabbage... So it can be two... for you! Cut! Oh, my gosh! What are you doing? How are you going to sell if you're like that? Why? I did everything you told me. Stop, look, and listen! Okay? Buy one snow cabbage, take one snow cabbage... So it can be two... for you! I don't like that! Look at your face! No way! Do I really have to do that? I'm going to look like a fool, Susano... Hey! What? What? Susano? Correction. My name is Sasha Valur. And yes, queen, you have to! That's how you sell online. Trust me. I'm a professional. So listen to me. I can see you, Mini. Stop laughing, or I won't do this. Okay. I got it. If you don't want to sell, and you're allergic to your customers, say goodbye to money. Wait, Sasha! Fine, I'll do it! Okay. Are you okay? Okay, me too. I'm okay. Action! Buy one snow cabbage, take one snow cabbage... So it can be two... for you! Perfect! Yes! That's what I like! -Yes, yes! Let's go! -Faster! We'll be late! Oh, my gosh! Wait! Pat! Wait for me! I'm tired! Hey! Take care of my vegetables. That's worth 2,000 pesos. I'm just kidding! Come on, we'll be late. Good morning, grandpa! That's good. Exercise everyday to strengthen your bones. My grandpa is really awesome! I knew I got my awesomeness from you! Let's exercise, Portia. Grandpa... I'm not your daughter. I'm Pat. Pat. Why don't you sit down, and drink your medicine so you don't forget my name? -Anybody home? -Oh, my gosh! Welcome the guests! You have mail. This was left at the town hall. Thank you, sir. Can we post this on your wall? Sure. Thank you! Sir, next time, knock before you come in. I'm conservative. Yes! My God! I was so shocked. Thank you, Portia! Pat! Pat! Why? Pat! -Why? -Pat! This... This is it! Is that really it? This is really it, Pat! Grandpa! Mini got accepted at the Ateneo de Manila University. Excuse me, grandpa. Are you sure? This is it? I got accepted at the Ateneo! I can't believe it! Pat, this is just an acceptance letter. Enrollment is another story. Come on, Mini! Don't you trust your sister? I'll make sure you'll enroll at the Ateneo. Pat... That's an expensive school. Your sister will do everything she can so you can enroll there, okay? But before anything else, I have to work. Me, too. -Grandpa Ining, we're leaving. -Really? Yes. No one can stop me. Even him? Even him. Let's go, Sasha! You're annoying me. This ugly face is annoying me. Pat, wait! Restroom break! Please return to the bus in 15 minutes. See, Pat? Our online selling strategy is so effective! Look, we already have pre-orders. Thanks to you, Susano. -What? Susa... -I'm kidding! Okay, whatever. What will you do if we bump into Dave? Hey! Don't say bad words. Wait for me! Pat! I'm just trying to make you laugh. You've become so serious after that Dave broke your heart. Is that what happens when people fall in love? Yes, so change the topic! Look! Your friends are here. Oh, my God! Sisters! My snow cabbage! Finally! (You're a loser! Just stay deactivated!) (They were right. You're nothing! I'm happy Kath left you.) Miss! Miss! Miss! Miss! Miss, are you okay? -Oh, my God! -Stop! -What are you doing to my cousin? -Wait! -What are you doing to her? -Wait a minute! I'm saving her! Pat, he's a thief! He's a thief! Oh, my God! This guy... That's not true. I threw my phone, and it hit you. You fell, then you passed out. As matter of fact, I was trying to save you. What did you do to me? Huh? I take very good care of my veggies. I personally clean and wash my veggies. I don't let anything else touch my veggies. It is very fresh. So, pay me! I'm sorry, but are we really talking about vegetables here? I'm not playing games with you! Pay me for my snow cabbage! Let me go... Babe. -Ouch! -Babe? Babe? Huh? Pay for it! Fine! Let me get my wallet from my car! See? I wasn't lying. Let's follow him, Pat. My car. Jerk. Pat... Oh, my God! I told you! That guy better not show his face to me again! I'll really punch him! Pat, you need to calm down. So it's okay to be late when you're an Assistant Manager? Good morning, Sandra. Stop with the attitude. We're not late. You're just too early. Pat, I'll go to my station. Okay. You can go back to your station, Sandra. I'll take care of this. Thanks! Guys, guys! Awesome welcome to Ows Hostel! Joy and blessings! Welcome! Wow! Just like a classroom. Get his things. Dude. Pat! Pat... Awesome! This is "Awesome"! Awesome! Grandson? Grandson? -Ouch! -I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. I didn't know that he was your grandson. -It hurts! -I'm really sorry. Yes, ma'am. We're sorry. She was just surprised. We were delivering goods this morning, when your grandson threw his phone at Pat. This Manila boy knocked my cousin out cold. Yes, but that didn't bother me much. I was just really mad because your son ruined my vegetables. And then he ran away. I'm sorry, ma'am. He ran away, then mocked us like this. Yes, ma'am. I'm really sorry. I really didn't mean it. -I'm really sorry. -Yes, grandma. Don't fire her. She looks so pitiful. And look, she's so pretty. I'm really not going to fire her... Because it was your fault. Not hers. How am I at fault? -You're at fault. -Me? -Why me? -Anyway, Pat, forgive my grandson. He's really like that. Whatever he owes you, I'll deduct from his salary. Okay, ma'am. Grandma? -Salary? -Yes. -Me? -Yes, I'll pay you. Unless you want to work for free, that's okay with me. You're kidding, grandma. I'm on vacation here. I am not kidding. You are going to work here. Come. -I want to introduce you to the staff. -Grandma, I won't stay... This is Sandra. -Hi. -She's the cashier. -And Sasha. -Grandma, I don't want to work... She's in housekeeping. You've got to be kidding me... Wait! And over there is Pat, our assistant manager. Grandma, no! I'm leaving. No. You're staying here until you figure out your life. And that's an order! Maybe if you experience a little hardship, then you'd stop being a burden to your mother. I don't want to stay here. I'm going back to Manila. I'll stay at my teammate's house. Go! Hello, Maxine? Maxine! I can't hear you. Hello, Maxine? Maxine! Clinton, let me crash at your place, please? Even just for a few days. Clinton! Coach, coach, answer this call! Please, answer my call, coach. -James? -Coach! Hello? What's up... Sorry. You do not have enough credit in your account to make this call. (Vince: How are you, bro? Are you okay? Kath and I are worried about you.) (Vince: If you need anything, just call or me. Take care.) Take care of the resort while I'm gone. Don't forget to give out flyers of the hostel, okay? -Yes, ma'am. I'll take care of everything. -Good. Grandma? You're leaving? Yes! Really? You're keeping me a prisoner here, and now you're leaving? Don't worry. Pat here will make sure you would be so tired working to miss me. You're assigned to housekeeping. And Pat will take you in as her trainee. Now, you make sure he does his job well. You're the officer-in-charge while I'm gone. You know how hectic conventions for school principals can be. I don't have time to babysit my grandson. -Grandma... -No! I am not a dictator. So I've decided to give you a salary of 6,000 pesos a month. And you, Pat, will be promoted as manager. Come on, grandma! Just 6,000 pesos per month? Is that how much you love me? You can get a raise once your boss here recommends it. Anytime. -Why would... -Shut up! Let me pass. Pat, if you don't really want to train James, just tell his grandma. But you won't get the salary increase along with the promotion. Won't I be able to earn double from online selling if I work double-time? Will people buy more of your vegetables if you work double-time... So you can double your earnings? Wait, Pat. I'll just pee. Grandpa? Grandpa. Grandpa, wake up. -Portia. -God bless. Portia, I'm happy you're back. I waited for you so we can eat together. Sit down. -Sit, Portia. -Grandpa... Your daughter left us a long time ago. But why? What will happen to us? Pat, what time did you get here? Mini, were you able to buy everything you needed? Just the pants. No shoes yet. Sorry, Pat. The school won't allow us to join the graduation ceremony... without complete uniform. Here. Buy everything you need tomorrow. Take it. Take everything. Thank you, Pat. Pat, what about our water bill? It's due tomorrow. I'm getting promoted soon, remember? So it's a yes for James? It's a yes for my family. Power! Work it, girl! Fight! You can do it! I believe in you. Let's eat. (Vince: If you need anything, just call or me. Take care.) (I love you.) (I can do this without all of you.) Good morning, Teng! Good morning, Bonita! Please take care of the guest rooms. Coach, I don't have anywhere else to go. Please take me in. I don't want to stay here. I'll be honest with you. I don't have a problem with you staying here. I just don't have extra money to fly you out... No, coach. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. I'll save up for it. Leave it up to me. Okay. I think 30,000 pesos is enough for a one-way ticket. That's enough to cover your plane ticket to Spain. Can you come up with the money? Of course, coach. I can get that amount. Leave it to me. Thank you, coach! No problem. My house is always open for my most valuable player. Thanks, coach. What's this? Miss! The room isn't ready yet? My baby and I have been waiting since forever. Right, baby? It's because of the trainee. How will you get promoted if these things happen? Excuse me. What's taking you so long? Basic. Hey, hey, hey! You son of a... There's so much trash! Clean it! You don't want to do it? Clean it! You're really not going to move? Boss, I was going to clean it... But you suddenly came in. Move faster! The guests are waiting! Yes, ma'am. I'll finish this in no time! What the... What? Cockroach! There's a cockroach! -Where? -There! -I can't see it. -It's there! You're so loud! It's just a cockroach! I was going to step on it. You just did it first. Whatever. Clean it up! I can do this faster than you. What if there's a baby cockroach? So do you want me to do it? -What kind of hostel is this? -Sorry, ma'am. Your website is not updated. I had a hard time finding this place. Unbelievable! Ma'am, ma'am... Awesome welcome to Ows Hostel! Joy and blessings! Welcome! I made you laugh, ma'am. Ma'am, don't let your beauty go to waste. You look cuter when you smile. What's up with you? You should be thanking me right now... Because I saved you. Right? If it weren't for me, the guest would still be yelling at you until now. So, boss, maybe you could put in a good word for me, and tell grandma I deserve an increase. What? Never mind. Give me that! Promise me 15,000 pesos, and I'll give it to you. Excuse me! Be careful with my bag. That's worth 15,000 pesos. This way, madam. Just straight ahead. -Give this to me! -No, this is mine! Let go! Ouch! -Give it to me! -You're really testing me, huh? What the hell? What are you two doing? -We're treating your bag like a baby. -Yes. You said it's worth 15,000 pesos. Give it to me! You're so weird! Give it to me! You, get out! What an attitude! Ouch! What the hell? -What are you doing? -Wait! I didn't... I'm stuck between your... But your... My foot! My foot is stuck! Get off of me! Wait! Hold on! Get off! Hold on! Relax. I'll count to three. I'll get up on three, pull yourself up too. -Okay? -Okay. On three. Okay? One, two, three! -Ouch! -What the hell? Just... wake up! What? I'm awake! Very awake! -Put some clothes on. -Pat! Did you wake him up? Yes, he's up. Too early for that. Give out these flyers. Go over there and distribute them. -Go now. -Wait a minute. This was not in our agreement. You want to get a raise, right? You want a higher salary? Right? Just tell me if you don't want it. Of course, I'll do it. Ma'am, I'm just kidding. I'll distribute these. I'll even go there. Can I start distributing now? Yes. Go that way, I'll go this way. Sure. But don't forget my raise! I'll count on it. So gullible! Hi, ma'am! Here's a flyer. Please check out Ows Hostel. -We offer big discounts today. -Where is this? Just over there. Hi, miss! Please check out Ows Hostel. Enjoy big discounts! -Thank you! -Thanks! So handsome. Pat? Am I hallucinating? Pat? Who are you talking to? No, you're not handsome. I meant ugly. Pat? Pat, did you get my message? And my friend request? Pat, wait! Pat, wait! -James! -I messaged you last night too. Pat, can we talk about... Babe! What are you doing, babe? You're so clingy. I've been looking for you. Where have you been? Hi, Dave! You're here. Were you standing there all this time? Pat, what happened to you? Are you okay? Are you sick? It's Dave... Dave... Oh no! Are you having a seizure? No! I'm serious! -Dave's here. -Wait! 15,000 pesos. What are you talking about? Okay, fine. 30,000 pesos every month. My fee for the kiss. That's why you have to tell grandma to give me a raise. Kiss? What is the meaning of this? Who was that guy? Why did you kiss me all of a sudden? Oh, my gosh! You kissed not one but two boys! No! Just one! Then who is this boy referring to? -It's Dave! Dave is here! -Dave? -Yes! I saw Dave! -Hold on! Who's that guy? Why do you act like you've both seen a ghost? He really is a ghost! Dave is the guy who left her wounded and in tears! And yes, he cheated on my cousin! Until now, she still hasn't moved on from him. Really? You're gossiping about me in front of me? I'm behind you. But I believe that she still hasn't moved on. Because until now, she still can't recite the "Oath of a Strong Woman". Dad? Dave, where are you? I thought you're following us here in Belgium? Why did you miss your flight? Dad, sorry. Something came up. I need to take some summer classes. What? Dad, I'll call you later to explain everything. I have to go. Enjoy your vacation! Bye! Hi, miss! Do you have an available room? That means my kiss is really valuable. I demand 50,000 pesos every month. That's what you're going to tell grandma. Wow! Do you have Kardashian lips? Boss, this is just a small favor. In fact, I'm begging you. You kissed me, but you didn't hear any complaint from me. In fact, I can sue you for stealing a kiss. What? You're so sweet, babe. Look at what you're doing now. I can sue you for harassment... Hi, Pat! Hi! This is James. My boyfriend. Boyfriend? Bro! James, bro. Nice to meet you. Dave, bro. Oh, I see you have a bag. Are you staying here in our province? For what? For business or pleasure? I have unfinished business to attend to. I left something here that I want to get back again. I want to book a room. Here? Why here? Why not? Are you fully-booked? Don't you have a house here? Why don't you stay there? Our house is under renovation. My parents are not here. Oh? They're out of the country. Stay there, Care Bear! Have I violated any of your policies? Or does this establishment discriminate against guests? No, sir. Welcome to Ows Hostel! Joy and blessings! Welcome! Babe, why are you making decisions? I'm the OIC, remember? Babe! You don't want grandma to get mad because we don't accept guests. Don't make her 15,000 times angry. You'll regret it. Oh, right! I'm the OIC, and I need to make sure all guests are welcome. Let's go, Sir Dave. I'm sure the hostel will be livelier because you're here. -Let's go? -Wait. Ma'am, let me carry his bag. I can manage. Okay, sir. This way. Oh, my gosh! I need to relax. 30,000 pesos. What? 20,000 pesos. -No! Sir Dave? 15,000 pesos with good acting. Nothing! Welcome again to Ows Hostel! Are you thinking about Dave again? Shut up! Let's just go. Stop that! -Stop whatever you're feeling. -Be quiet! Let's go. You're on the way to Weakness Station again. Remember how he left you heartbroken? Remember your promise to Mini? And your promise to grandpa? Pat, look at me! Repeat after me! Oath of a Strong Woman. Oath of a Strong Woman. I'm dizzy! I'm dizzy! I'm confused! I'm confused! Isn't this what you wanted? Isn't this what you wanted? But I'm okay now! But I'm okay now! I'm no longer weak! I'm no longer weak! I will no longer cry! I will no longer cry! Because I don't love you anymore! Because I don't... -Let's go home! -Pat! Come on! Love, I hope this makes you smile when I'm not around. Are we there yet? Just a little more. Surprise! What's this for? Can't you tell, Pat? I've been sticking to you like a starfish all summer. I didn't want to assume. Who knows if you're just friendly or... I love you, Pat. Yeah, right. Wow! Instead of saying "I love you" back. -Okay. I'll just leave. -Wait, Dave! Come back here. Are you sure? I love you. You. You. You. I love you, too. Excuse me. Where's Dave? I'll just give him this soup because he said he's sick. I didn't know there was a party. Just go in. You can give it to him directly. I need to buy something. Let's go? Alice? Oh, my gosh! How have you been? Miss, is that what we ordered? Please bring it straight to the kitchen. We've been waiting for that. Oh, no. This is for Dave. Dave? I'm his girlfriend. Excuse me. Okay. -Pat? -Love. Girlfriend? I made you soup because you said you're sick. Pat, I'm so sorry. I'll call you. Babe. What's going on here? Clean up your mess. Don't make me lose face. Who is she? A friend. Thank you for this. Take care on your way home. I'm so sorry, Pat. Let's go. Cheers to the heartbroken! Portia, my daughter, I'm happy you came back home. Portia, come here. Come here, my daughter. There, there. Dave is the mayor's son. Soon enough, he'll run for office, too. Wait. Why did Pat and him break up? You're interested in Pat, aren't you? Of course not. I'm just curious. You know, James, be careful because Pat is a sly girl. Sandra! You're always gossiping about Pat! Why? Is it wrong to warn James? I'm just concerned because he might be a Dave number two. Dave number two? What's that supposed to mean? Be a "Dave". Be the one who's fooled. Oh no! Not true. That's fake news! Dave is the one who left Pat up in the air. That's the tea! That's what they said. But we all know what really happened. What happened? Nothing. All of those are just speculations. Sandra, stop making stuff up! Whatever. I warned you, James. Don't be a Dave number two. You'll just get hurt. Why would I be a Dave number two? Pat and I are not a thing. Miss Hollywood Reporter, she's not my type! Besides, I won't stay here for long. I'm going back to work. I don't want to be in the hot seat. Aunt Bechay, come on! Buy more vegetables. That's too few. This is good for the skin and for the bones. This will make you healthier. Everything you need is in my snow cabbage. Please? -How many more? -Fine. You're so persistent. I'll get three more. Three more. Okay. -Here's my payment. Wait, ma'am. -Thank you. I'll see you next week. Sure. Spain? Who's going there? No, it's nothing. Are you done? I just need to sell these. It will be quick. I'll just go to my usual client. Just a minute. Promise. No worries. Watch where you go. Aunt Vicky! I brought your orders from last week. They're all fresh. As fresh as you. -Really? -Of course. You don't have to flatter me. I'm just telling the truth. You knew me since I was a baby. Give it to me! I paid for this! This is mine! I paid for this! I paid for this! That's grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! -I paid for this! -What do you mean you paid for it? You, liar! Give that to me! What's the problem, sir? Sir, sir! Grandpa! Sir, just relax. Maybe we can talk about this calmly to avoid raising a ruckus? This old man doesn't want to give me the doll I bought for my daughter. Let's give this to him, grandpa. We will buy a new one. Let's return it. I'm so sorry, sir. My grandpa has Alzheimer's disease. Thank you, ma'am. Finally, I can leave. Grandpa. Grandpa, stop crying. We'll buy an ice cream. We'll buy taro ice cream. Do you want taro ice cream? Come on, grandpa. Stop crying. Grandpa, who's the doll for? For my grandchild, Pat. What else does your grandchild want? We'll buy everything. Snow cabbage. What a coincidence! Look! Did you know that I took very good care of this veggie? I personally washed it and cleaned it. I do not let anything else touch this veggie. It's very fresh. I'm giving this to you. Here you go. Regards to your grandchild. Snow cabbage. Grandpa Ining! Pat? Sorry. I just bought medicine. When I turned back, he was gone. I'm sorry. It's okay, but be sure to not let him out of your sight again. You and grandpa go home and rest. Okay? -Let's go home, grandpa. -Yes, go home. It's time to rest. Let's go! -Come on! -Mini! -Faster! You're so slow! -Take care! Yes, Pat! Thank you! Mini, how is he? Have you eaten already? Did you give grandpa his meds? Make sure he eats first. Is he still having tantrums? Keep me updated. Bye. Can I see you again... Before all of this ends? I just need a second of your embrace... That I will never feel again. Every memory, I know I shall bury... Every happy moment that I have spent with you. Now that there's no more us... Where do I go when you are my world? Didn't you promise we'll be together until the end? Is this what you meant when you said the end? Sasha, you're in charge for now, please. This is my house. Thank you for walking me home. I'm fine now. How many times in a day do you tell yourself that? What? That you're fine. 15,000 times. Why? Why do you ask like there's an us? I better go in. Thank you. Good night. I didn't see you when I was here last year. Are you new? Yes. I'm the new guy. You know about me and Pat, right? Not really. We don't talk about you. But I heard that you were a jerk. Are you really together? I knew it. My dad's in politics, bro. I smell fake when I see it. What do you mean fake? I just don't know what to call it. We just recently got together. I don't know all those labels. You don't believe me? Suit yourself. Look, details don't matter, bro. What's important is Pat is not yours, right? Left. Bro, I'm serious. What do you need? Just help me with Pat. There must be something you need. Is it money? You got it. Money? You don't even know how much I need yet. Is that how politicians really work? You let money talk? I'm not my father, bro. I know it was my fault. But can't a man change? I just need another chance. I love Pat. And I know she still loves me. I'm not the bad guy here, James. I just need a shot with Pat. That's it. Will you be in my team? James! So... Let's go? Hey! Don't look at me like that. I already told you, you're not my type. Let's go! Our customer's waiting for us. By the way, who's this VIP customer? Do you... Do you have a power bank? Nope. I'll just get mine. You can go ahead. Okay, but be quick. Good evening, sir! Your food's here. Pat? I was a coward, Pat. Pat... You know that my whole life's already planned out, right? I'm taking the course my parents want for me. Be a politician like my dad. Choosing the girlfriend that they want me to marry. I didn't expect you to happen, Pat. I didn't expect to fall in love with you. And the moment I realized that, I couldn't find the heart to tell you that I had a girlfriend in Manila. -Pat... -What? What more do you want? I just want to say sorry for everything. Which part exactly? The part where you made me look like the other woman? Or the part where you let the people here judge me? Or the part where you let your family belittle me? Everything. Sorry for everything, Pat. I'm sorry that I wasn't ready when I met you. Sorry that I was unfair to you. I don't have an excuse. But I know that I've been a jerk to you, Pat. And I've worked on myself... Because I know you deserve nothing less. And now I'm back. Because I want to be that man that you deserve. Pat... I still love you. Love? You fight for who you love. You choose who you love. You chose to leave me. Just please give me a chance to fix this. Pat... You didn't tell me I was selling my conscience for 30,000 pesos. I want out. I didn't know that Pat went through all of that. I don't need your judgment, bro. The deal's off. This is wrong. -Oplan: Forget Him! -Oplan: Forget Him! Pat, face us! Stop crying. Face us! What do Martians call their meetings? What? Semi-mars! Seminars. Get it? That wasn't funny. Okay, I have three jokes. Shoot. Joke, joke, joke! Still not funny? Want me to make it eight? Joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, joke! I can double that. Just tell me. Oh, my God! Who's knocking at this hour? Pat! Hi! What are you doing here? How do I tell you this? I just want to apologize for what happened earlier. -I don't know how to explain this but... -Stop it. It's okay. I know how politicians work... Especially Dave's family. They're really like that. Oh. It's you. What are you doing here? Oh, my gosh! How rude of me, Mini me! This is James, our co-worker... And also GOO. GOO. Grandchild of the Owner. James. We met at the market. Remember? Wait, wait! You still haven't answered my question. Are you here to declare your love? Because if you're courting me, I'm telling you my parents are strict. Are you okay? Stop worrying. I won't tell Sandra that a customer left. I'm sure she'll rat you out to Grandma. It's not that. Besides, I don't blame her. My mom left us to be with her dad... Sir Bert. Mini was very young then. Let's talk about something else. You might think I'm being melodramatic. You know... I'm an only child. But I grew up with my cousin, Vince. He's in the US now... For his internship. My mom paid for all of the expenses. Why do you sound bitter? I'm not. It's just that when I told her that I wanted to study abroad... She said we don't have the money... And that I would just fool around. But Vince's internship? All-out support. Because "he'll do good, for sure". But when it comes to me? "Nothing, for sure". Are you sure you're not bitter? Imagine your own parents having no faith in you. In my entire life, there's always someone better than me. Is that the reason for the brawl during the basketball game? Yes. And I had to defend my dad's honor. You're right. Most people judge without knowing the whole story. Last year, I got drunk with some of the foreign guests. We partied everywhere. The stories went everywhere, too. What they didn't know was that... I was just trying to drown out the pain that Dave caused. What? Did I hear you right? You had a moment of weakness? But you're so strong! Mini even got into brawls fighting for me. Such a shame! He was the valedictorian, but he was stripped of honors. That's what woke me up. I thought to myself that... I can't just cry in a corner. Yes, I did some things that I'm not proud of. But what is one night of weakness? Do I let it consume me forever? Of course not! So now, whatever hurtful words they throw at me... Flirt... Slut... Trash... It's okay. What can those words do to me? Will they bring food to our table? And the world won't stop turning even if we're hurt. So we should just fight. Keep on fighting! Do you think... I still have a chance? Of course! I believe in you. Hey! Why did you do that? You're a new person now. That's an order! Is that so? Get more water. The two of us... We're new people now. That's an order too! So cold! What's your new name? "That's an order". Guys, James thought of something to attract more guests. -Gather around! Listen to his plan. -Guys, let's go! Let's put tables here and here. And a stage over there. And chairs. Okay? Do you have any suggestions, Pat? It's great! (Pat: You were amazing today. Perfect!) (James: I got that from you!) (Sandra: Ugh.) Let's check it out! -Ouch! -Are you okay? -It's grounded! -I'll do it. Okay. You too? I'll do it. Let me do it. Kidding! Beautiful! In fairness to you! I never thought you had it in you. What? Intestinal gas? You're gross! (Sandra: What if we organize an event?) (Sasha: I agree! Auction Night?) (Pat: Acoustic Night?) (James: Date Night?) (Sandra: Stop flirting and start working!) Sasha, here. There. Move it to the left. Is this alright? That's good! Perfect! Beautiful! Slowly, please. What's wrong? -What's wrong with your back? -Ouch! (Pat: Thanks, James!) (Pat: Thanks, James!) (James: No problem. Did you have dinner already?) (Pat: Not yet.) (James: Eat your dinner now.) (Pat: Is that an order?) (James: I'm just concerned.) What do you like in a guy? Even the son of the mayor didn't meet your standards. Of course I want someone kind-hearted... Respectful... And most of all... Simple. I wish I'm all of that. What? What are you doing? Sing your favorite song that makes you happy. No! I don't want to. Come on! Don't let my saliva go to waste. Fine! My love for you will never ever change... What song is that? You don't know this? It's my favorite song. "Simple Guy" by Gloc 9. My love for you will never ever change. No storm can stop me from fetching you, babe. This is how I fly. I'm a simple guy. This is all I can brag to you. You don't have to grant all of my wishes. I just want to let you know... You will never ever shed a tear again. I will immediately wipe it off. You'll never doubt again. Even if I have nothing else but my fare. Let's go! We look like fools. -Flex your biceps! -One more! -Smile! -You look so handsome, Sir Dave! Thank you for modelling for us! I'm sure the website will crash because of you. I feel like it will crash even more if they're both topless. Sir Dave, James, please remove your top. Take a picture while they're undressing. -There! Nice! -More. Tilt up the cam. -Oh, my gosh! -How about this? -Here? -Stop moving, Sandra! Wonderful! Perfect! How about James? Oh, James is here. Dave, you're good to go. You can change now. Bonita, give Dave his casual wear. -Next layout. -It's your turn, James. Remove your top. It's your turn. Try to look hot. Take your time. There! We still have a lot of time. This camera has a long battery life. Here we go! Three... two... we're good! You're amazing, James! -Thank you! -Thank you! Our turn. You're so good, James. Thank you, James! Don, make sure we look good in the photo. What's wrong? I'm not comfortable doing this. I'm not a model. You're nervous. Don't be. It's easy. Let's do this. Give me your hands. Let's shake them to shake off the nervousness. And then... Ows Hostel! Just embrace it! You're really nervous. Just pull up your shoulders like this... So you have a good stance. Chin up... To avoid a double chin. And then look at the camera... As if you're looking at your crush. -Whatever! -Pat! You're ready! Come here! It's your turn! Enough, Sandra. You're taking up all the memory. Come here, quick! She'll use up all the space. You can do it. Just remember I'll be right behind Sandra. I'll be cheering you on. Go now. Stand there, Pat. You know what to do, right? Do it like how we sell our veggies. Play some music... To put Pat in the mood. That's good. -Project! -Sandra, take a better shot. Beautiful. Huh? What? It feels so good loving you. I can't hear you. I said... I have a crush on you! Huh? I meant Don. Don has a crush on you. Can you please focus on your work, Don? The music stopped because you think Pat is pretty. Sasha's right! She's your crush. We know. Okay, Pat. Back to work. Guys, great job earlier! Let's go back to work. Sasha, take care of the guests. -Okay. I'll just transfer the pictures. -Okay, thanks. I hope you're fine with me being here. Sandra asked if I could join the photoshoot. Thanks. Excuse me. Pat! Grandpa was brought to the Health Center! What? Grandpa? Leave me alone! Grandpa! It hurts! Don't touch me! Grandpa, it's alright. I'm here. Portia, I looked for you at the plaza. The kid told me you were there. Stop crying, grandpa. I'm here now. Wait. What happened? I don't know. Someone from the town hall called me to say grandpa was bitten by a dog. What? Doctor, how's my grandfather? Is he okay? What do we need to do? What medicines do we need to buy? Miss, I already cleaned your grandfather's wound. I also gave him an anti-tetanus shot. But he needs anti-rabies shots too. We ran out of it. It's the life of a senior citizen we're talking about here. Is there any other way? Are there any other nearby hospitals we can go to? There is, but it's a two-hour drive. What's the problem? What do we need? They're out of anti-rabies shots. Sir Dave, we ran out of supply for anti-rabies shots. Pat... Let's go to the other clinic. It's just two hours. That's manageable. Let's borrow the hostel's van. Let's use it. Are you sure? Of course. Let's go. We're good. The supplier's on the way. Really? Thank you, Dave! Thank you so much! Anything for you, Pat. Thank you for coming to the first Movie Night of Ows Hostel! Please settle down... Because the movie will start in a few minutes. Pat, this is awesome! This is the first time I've seen Ows Hostel this packed. I know, right? Make sure that the guests are well attended to. I promise, Pat. But can we watch too? Please? We deserve this. Fine. Just be attentive to the needs of the customers, okay? Make sure that we immediately give them what they want. Perfect timing! Give them to me. Thank you! Thanks, Don! Go watch too. There's a lot of people. Pat! Sasha. Hi! Is this taken? No. Hello! What you did here is awesome! There are so many guests. Thank you. James! Is that food? Give me some! Let's sit there! There's some space left. Come on. -James! -There's still some space left. -James, sit here. -It's James. Careful. Okay, guys. The movie is about to start. So, sit back, relax and enjoy the show. What movie is this? Just watch. This is my favorite! "Because I Love You So"? This is what you really chose, huh? -Want some? -Want some? No, thanks. This movie is really great. This is my favorite, actually. Me too. Rico and Claudine. They're perfect for each other. I don't think so. Rico's character only knows how to act cute. Diether, though. Diether is the one who really knows Claudine. Look. Right, babe? Look. Yes, James. Look! What is he dancing like that? I don't want to say bad words, but it's just really funny. I think it's sweet. Why are they rolling on the ground? Claudine might hit her head. She should wear a helmet! Oh, my gosh! I mean, a good man knows how to make his girl feel safe and happy at the same time. True. So sweet! You take care of the rest. Sandra, rewind it a little. The ending's my favorite part. Claudine must have really loved Rico, right? She still forgave him after everything. What do you think, Pat? I think he should be taught a lesson. Not everything can be solved through brute force. At least he's not a coward. Rico's a good guy. He's not perfect, but he learned from his mistakes. And he's willing to do what it takes because that's how much he loves her. Love? Love! He played her. You know, once a cheater, always a cheater. Right, Pat? It's Rico who's perfect for Claudine. Diether won't make Claudine's life better. He's actually a burden. Why don't we ask Pat? What do you think, Pat? Who would you choose? Yes, Pat. Who? You're too engrossed in the film. For me, the ending is fine. And in real life, Claudine and Rico really loved each other. I'll just get my power bank. (Am I the loser in this story again?) (I have to let go.) (The longer I hold on, the stronger the pain.) Seems like you're in a good mood, Pat. Of course! Life is beautiful. So you've already moved on? Of course, Mini. She has a new one. Oh yeah! Team James! Don't bet everything on Team James. Mini, I know he's not Dave. But remember, Pat, he also has a lot of red flags. Why? When you find someone and see their flaws... Do you just leave them? So you're choosing James? Hello? Let's meet up. Don, have you seen James? Playing basketball. Okay. Thank you. Hey! What do you need? The deal's back on. I'll help you with Pat. Really? 30,000 pesos as originally agreed upon. Okay. Though I thought Pat's much more valuable than that to you. This is not about how valuable she is to me. A ticket to Spain costs 30,000 pesos. Take good care of her. For sure. We have a deal? What's this? Pat, it's not what you think. Pat, let me explain. Pat. Pat, I just thought it would be better if I leave... Than let myself fall deeper for you. Pat, I truly fell for you. It became real for me. I really wanted you to be mine. I wanted you to be my girlfriend. I know I'm nothing compared to Dave. Even then, even until now, I always lose. No matter what battle I fight, I always lose. Pat... I only did that because I got scared. You, jerk! You're a coward! You don't have balls! Or maybe it's up in here. You have balls for a brain! Tell me, how much am I worth? Is it per kilo? How much do you need for you to treat me like this? Pat, I'm sorry. James, I was going to choose you. I was willing to bet on us... Because I thought you're the one. You saw the real me, and you accepted me. But you're just like them. Pat, I was wrong. Yes, you were! You're wrong! Because you don't see that people like me... faced our fears just to love you. Next time... If you want to flee from people who love you... Just do it. Don't make people believe that you're ready to love when you're not. Don't let people feel that you love them when you can't fight for them. Don't ask for my trust... If you're only going to betray me. Portia is finally home! -Thank you, mom! -This looks good on you. What are you doing here? Pat, my child... Get out of this house if you don't want me to drag you out! Pat! What? I know how selfish I am for leaving you. But, Pat, I was not as strong as you are now. Lucky you! You can choose to be selfish. Me? I didn't have a choice. That's why I'm here now. I want to change that. I want to help with Mini's education. No need. We're fine. We don't need you so you're free to leave because that's what you're good at! Pat, don't yell at mom! I know a lot has happened, but she's still our mother. Thank you very much to our last bidder! Now, we will start the bidding for our final item. The proceeds of this auction will go to the preservation of our coral reefs. Who wants to start the bidding? Welcome to Ows Hostel! That's mine! Mind the customers, okay? Pat, that's enough! -Please. -Stop it! Don't touch me! Cheers! There are a lot of people here. Give me the beer! What the hell! Why do you care? Do you want to make out here? Okay! You can take a video of me. Show it to your parents so they know how big of a slut I am. We can even do a live feed! -Give that to me! People are watching. -Don't touch me! Hey, let me pass! Stay there! Stop following me! Pat, what are you doing? And you? What are you doing? Maybe you're spreading rumors about me again, right? -Are you happy now? -Pat! Isn't that the Mayor's son? Take a video! Quick! Sit down, Sandra, and watch me! Go! Go! -Get off the stage! Enjoy! -What?! -Pat! -Go there! Leave me! What's up our awesome guests? We will start the highlight of the auction night. And the prize is a night with me! Game! Let's start the bidding. Do I hear 5,000 pesos? 5,000 pesos, sir? 5,000 pesos! What? 3,000 pesos? Sir, 3,000 pesos? 3,000 pesos? What do you say? I'm still fresh. As fresh as my veggies. None? 2,000 pesos? 2,000 pesos, sir. Don't let your permed hair go to waste. Come on! No? Don't be too choosy! Okay, fine. 1,000 pesos. The auction night is a smart idea. Look how many... This is it! Okay... 500 pesos? 500 pesos. Any takers? 300 pesos! 300 pesos? Oh, sir. You can do better than that. Buy me at 500 pesos! Why would you take 200 pesos off? What are you doing? Stop! I have a customer! 300 pesos? Let me go! Are you insane? -What happened to Pat? -I'll take care of this. You and Dave were right! I gave them a very low rate. That's how low I see myself... Still nobody wants me. I almost gave myself away for free. But you're so smart! You were right! -Pat. -I am worthless. Don't touch me! Don't say that. You're drunk. Drink some water. I shouldn't say those things? Why not? Isn't that how you see me too? Worthless! No value at all! Someone you can sell! -Pat, that's not true... -Not true? You're denying now because people outside might hear us? I'm not the one who should be ashamed. What did I do wrong? I just loved. I loved Dave. I loved you. My mother. Mini. My family. And for what? They all left me. You all hurt me. Should I always mend your brokenness when others break you? Should I always understand you when you do something wrong? I have nothing left to give! I already gave everything... Everything I have, but why am I always not enough? Pat, no. I love you. And I love you. But I am valuable. I have worth. I am special. And I can't be loved by someone who do not have the courage to fight for me. Pat! Leave me. Please. Is Pat okay? You, jerk! Huh? You just stood there? Just because there were a lot of people? You're scared your name will be tainted? I thought you love her? Why didn't you do anything? Huh? Why didn't you do anything? We screwed everything up. You don't deserve her. We don't deserve her. Pat, grandpa is still up. -Good evening, grandpa. -It's already late. How come you just came home? We attended a big event at the hostel. Pat, I'll go ahead. Don't stay up too late. Grandpa? I'm really not the kind of girl worthy of being chosen, right? This is for my granddaughter... But you can have it. I feel sad for you... Because no one chooses you. I don't think my Pat needs that... Because my Pat has me. I always choose her. Everyday. A lot of people love that kid... Especially her mother. It's a pity they had a misunderstanding recently... But I'm sure they'll be okay in no time. You know why? Why? Because... I taught my granddaughter how to forgive. She's stubborn... But she has a good heart. And that's what happened, ma'am. I'll go ahead, ma'am. Grandma, I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? I'm so sorry, grandma. Thank you. I love you. I love you too. Thank you, grandma. Are you sure nobody saw Dave at that girl's auction? But you paid them? Good. What did you do, dad? Nothing I wouldn't have done if you hadn't rebelled. I'm a rebel because I don't go with your plans? A girl with a scandal and a daughter of a mistress will not be helpful to you. You know in your speeches, you always talk about serving the people. But when was the last time you talked to an employee and asked about his day? But Pat... Even the guy who delivers ice, she never fails to ask how he is. She's the kindest and most caring person I know, dad. I'm actually the one who is bad for her. That... That's how you should argue during electoral debates. I am doing this for your own good. You have a bright future ahead of you. You're right. I have my whole life ahead of me. But I'm not going to waste it on meeting your expectations. I'm your legacy... But you know, sometimes, I just want to be your son. You are a born politician. I don't want to be one, dad. I'm sorry. If anything happens, this is on me. I just... I just need to stay true to myself. I hope you understand. We're getting off here. I heard you need reinforcements. Ouch! That hurts! Is that how you welcome me? What are you doing here? Didn't you all leave me? Wow! Mr Sensitive! Weren't you the one who left the group? You all seem to be fine without me. The group can never be completely happy if one's missing. Plus you've been flooding Da Vinci Quotes. That's why I came here to tell you to stop flooding. Flooding? That wasn't me. Who do you think you're fooling? I know you better than my alphabet. You're always so exaggerated! Okay, seriously now. I came here... Because I can't leave the guy who also never left me... When I had nothing. You're my idol! Me? Yes. But you're always number one. Me? Number one? Remember during PE class, I'm always the last one to get called? During my birthdays, I never had celebrations and parties like yours. Even my long-time crush... She had the biggest crush on you. It's not important how it started. She still chose you in the end. I was surprised, honestly. But you know what I realized? That feeling is not new to me. The feeling of getting chosen. Wow! Everytime you're present for PE class... The entire class wanted to be in your team. But me, your very weak cousin... You always chose me. I also never experienced being alone during my birthday... Because you're always there. Remember when I first moved in? Your mom gave me all of your old clothes. You had a tantrum, and I thought you were mad at me. But when they took us to the mall, you didn't buy anything. Everything we bought was for me. And I realized... You were the very first person who always chooses to choose me. So now... I'm here to remind you... Of the things I have learned from you. If you were not chosen, someone better is meant for you. You just have to wait for her to come. But of course, once she's there... You should also choose her. Because if you let her go, then you're stupid. Do you think she'll forgive me? Bro, six words from Da Vinci Quotes. "The right person will forgive you." If I were you, I'd choose her. Go for it! I missed you, bro. Thank you. Missed you too, bro. Give me a kiss. Kiss? Don't be shy! No, show me around first. How's life here? Pat, come on! You look decent. You're perfect. You look like an angel. She will not eat you alive, promise. Who? Who will eat you alive? No one. Pat's here, ma'am. Ma'am, I'm really sorry about what happened at the auction night. Just deduct from my salary whatever – Stop! I'm the one who should apologize for my grandson. Sandra told me everything. Thank you, ma'am! It's okay. Enough. Come on, let's eat! Thank you, ma'am. Yes! I love free food! Let's start! Hi, Pat. Yes? I came here to give this to you. Pat, I'm so sorry. I know I sound like a broken record already but... I don't know. When it comes to you, I just feel like I always mess up everything. I guess you're right. I don't know how to love... If I failed to make you feel how worthy you are of being loved. And it's all on me. I'm very sorry. I'm leaving for the US soon. I'm going to study there. I'll stay there for awhile. I hope I can be as strong as you. Please don't forget me. I'm always going to love you, Pat. You know, even if you're in the middle of a busy crowd... I will always recognize you. You never forget the people you loved. Have you spoken to James? Not yet. And maybe not anytime soon. I've reached my quota for love. I don't think this is for me. Hey! The chance I was asking for... Give it to him. You're giving yourself a chance by giving him a chance. Whatever you may think of yourself... You are not broken beyond repair, Pat. And when the one finally shows up... It's a matter of you showing up for him as well. Go, James! James, do it! Even if I am not rich... And even if there are a lot of other guys... This is how I fly. I'm just a simple guy. All that I can boast to you is... My love for you will never ever fade. Don't be afraid of the storm. I will be your shade. I don't fly high. I'm just a simple guy... Who still hopes... Snow cabbage. Snow cabbage, right? Pat... You know I used to always ask myself... "Why not me?" But now I know the answer. Because you still had to come into my life. Pat, I love you. Never ever ask yourself that again... Because I will always choose you... Fifteen thousand times. I love you very much... Fifteen million times. But first, you need to rap Gloc9's "Simple Guy". Oh no! James, you can do it! Do your best! You can do it. Okay, grandma. We believe in you, James! One, two, three... -You don't have to... -You don't have to grant all of my wishes. I just want let you know. You will never shed a tear again. I'll wipe them away till they end. You never have to doubt again. Even if I... Guys! Time to eat! Is Sasha already there? She's bringing the ice. It's melting. What? My eyes are melting looking at you. Look at them! Sasha! Yes? Let's see who breathes longer underwater. Game? I'll count! One, two, three! Do you want to talk about it? Actually, I'm on my way back to Manila... But I'll leave later. Heavy traffic. I'm Dave. Trish. Trish... Is that short for something? Patricia. But you can also call me Pat.
