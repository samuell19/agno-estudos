We have to drink 8 glasses of water and sleep 8 hours a day. We shouldn't smoke too much and drink too much wine. We shouldn't sleep around. We have to receive body check regularly. We shouldn't cross the street when the light is red. We shouldn't get married around the ago of 30. We shouldn't swing our legs when we sit. We'd shut off our mobile phone when we are watching a movie. There are nothing should or shouldn't do. Anything? They are inside. - Is it shone's information? - Yes! - How many people are there? - Two. How come you didn't go inside? I will go after I finish my ice-cream. Stop looking! Robbery. Don't move. I am warning you! Don't move. Don't do anything stupid. - I just want money. - I just work here! Don't mess around... Just shoot if you have guts! It's my job. What the hell! How come you are eating potato chips?! You dare to eat potato chips when we are robbing here! Get up! You want me to blow your head away, huh! - No, don't hit my head. - No. Don't shoot my head. Just shoot my body, okay. I'll count to 3, if you yell again I am going to blow your head off. 1, 2... Don't come any closer. Stop or I am going to shoot. Stop... The breast is fake. Miss, are you okay? Put off your clothes first, quick! Squat! Stay aside! Miss, don't worry, everything is fine. I promise to... protect you. Anything new with the case on dragon? It's under investigation. He is crazy! He killed over 6, 7 people already. Do you need back-up? No! I will contact you when I need it. No! Why do you say that? He is too childish! He always wants to play. And you just let him go. Sister foon, my friend will go shopping in France and Milan. Do you want any new handbags? You want to give me a gift? A gift? No problem. But why don't you give me couple thousands to spend? - When should I give you money? - Today. I want to transfer Brian to prince's team. I will be back real quick. Have you taken your medicine yet? You are not young anymore. You shouldn't lose your temper easily in the police station. I will buy you some candy soon... Mike, are you following the case on dragon? What's wrong, prince? You have to follow that case closely. My vacation is coming up, don't let me worry about your job. To finish your shit! What the hell? How come he bought the same shoes as mine? He always buys whatever I have had. Officer kwong said that he would never give it back to you. What is it? How come it is a gun? What's else? Don't mind him, hasn't taken his medicine yet. Let's go have a chat. Stop it! Do you think that you are still young? - Are you still young? - Don't mess around too much. Finish this too. No more, I will give all to him. I have something to say. I provided you all the information I know. But now you put me here! What did I do wrong? Did I offend you? You'd be careful. You said that there were only 2 men in the supermarket. We go both of them but one has escaped. I am only an informer. I am not a CIA agent. The American made a mistake and bombed the Chinese embassy too. There will always be mistakes. Informer?! Are you playing trick with me?! Don't be like this! I am not going to talk to you again! Who do you think you are? Sorry... don't! Sorry?! Who are you going to tell about dragon's where abouts? I told you whatever I have got. That's all you have got?! - Stop playing with me. - Keep quiet. Just one durian left. - Are you going to say it?! - Okay, I tell you. Say it. I heard that dragon thought that he didn't make too much money last time. So he is planning something big. You want to do something big of course you need to have weapons. If you need weapons you will go look for a man called "lighter". I am 100%% % sure. Flat 6d of this building. Is the elevator out of service? Uncle, watch out for that switch. Don't plug 7 things on one switch. I am not joking with you, it will cause a fire. You don't have to be like this? It's very dirty. Thank you. Sorry, we are police, we want to use your apartment for surveillance. No! Police, we want to use your apartment. - Not convenient. - Your period has come? Little girl, is there anyone else at home? Don't open the door to strangers again. We are from cable TV. - Shut up. - What are you doing? Shut up... we are not thieves! We are police! Shut up! Sorry, granny. Granny, we are police. We want to use your house for surveillance purpose. So what if you are police?! Damn cat! How dare you scratch me?! Why do you hit me? Sorry, we are police. We really want to use this apartment for surveillance. It is very important for us to have your help. How long will use this apartment? About 8 to 10 days. We won't take up too much of your spaces. We will only be using your balcony. Since you look so Sincere. I will rent it to you. What are you doing? Something is going on! This asshole must be "lighter". Move over a little. A little more... okay. Right... What? Is that a cat? No, get to work. Come eat some noodles first. Granny, thanks. - Do you want some? - Okay. Cook it yourself. Long time no see, I don't know how Mei is doing? She is so poor. Stone, are you playing trick with me again?! - I don't dare! - Good! - Is dragon really going to show up? - Of course. When? Should we wait for him till the next year? - No. - It's stink. I have transferred $29,700 to your account already. You better don't mess up with me! I don't dare! - Really? - Of course! Don't disappear again. Don't look at me. I will not wear the same shoes as prince again. This is my principle. Prince has a dick too. Why don't you throw away yours?! It is not the same! Mine is so long, how can I throw it away?! Your turn. Quick! I can't stand it. I let you slept one more hour already, and that is not enough? Pay attention. Quick. Watch it. Are you Mike or Brian? Who are you? I am yen, stone told me to come look for you. I am downstairs, where are you? Make a left turn now. Cross the street and you will see den tong building. Take the elevator, go up to 6th floor and ring the bell of room c. Get it. I'm tired. Where can I sleep? I am tired, let me sleep here. Who is she? She is cute. Very beautiful. I told her to come, she is my god-sister. She has no place to stay. Stone, stop messing around. Take her away at once. I can't, I am in Macau right now. Look after her for me, she will leave after she wake up. - Don't let me see you. - Let's stop here... It smells good. - Have you finished? - Of course not. She is stone's girlfriend. What are you talking about? I am stone's god-sister. Don't mind her, send her away. It's late now. Let her sleep here then. You like her? What are you talking about? Of course. Don't worry, I will take care of my business first. Have you got a condom? Go buy it. You are right. Wake up, get up... - What? - Go. Where? I don't care, just disappear. Go or not? Go... Don't be cocky. Damn it! Hello... my name is yen. Ask the account holder whether I can go sleep at his place... Tell him to call me back. I walked so far to buy this... - Where is the girl? - She left. After she woke up she asked what this place was. She picked up her handbag and left. Why didn't you stop her? Why did you let her go? She has arms and legs, how can I stop her? What should I do now? I am so horny! Go take care of it in the bathroom! You are not young anymore. I bought condoms too. Brian. Good morning. Brian, it's you! When did you come? Leung?! When did you two come here? Why didn't you give me a call? Have you got your breakfast? Let grandma make you a noodle. Why didn't you give me a call? I started to be afraid of this grandma. Leung. - Is it good? - Of course! What's the matter? I always teach you not to point your chopsticks at people. Why can't you ever learn? Leung is a better boy. Granny... Granny, where did you go? Don't hide. Someone picked on me. I didn't pick on you. Your grandma always let her cat shit all over the place. She never admit it. It was all over my door way. I really don't have a cat. Why can't you just admit to your fault. Acting dumb all the time. - Let's go take a look with me. - Let's go. This way. Brian, it's good you are here. Throw away the trash for me later. - What are you doing here? - Looking at you changing uniform. Don't tell me that... You slept here last night and get changed your uniform when you woke up. Go to school then. - Exactly. - Why didn't you go home last night? I didn't want to go home. Why did you leave last night? Your friend kicked me out. Okay, I will deal with this. - Where are you going now? - School. - Let me go with you. - No, thanks. When can we meet again? It depends on fate. Come on. Baby... Take the stairs, she has a boyfriend! Let's go. Are you trying to scare me? Let's have a talk. He's police! Let's go. Sorry, sir. Go! See? It is not human's shit. Not dog shit but is cat shit. Those grannies always act like they are stupid. This is useless. Sorry. You have to say sorry, but I hope it won't happen next time. What? Where are you going? Which gang are you with? So that if you are a police? I never told you to go clean it up. Sir, sorry, where are you taking me to? I didn't tell you to go clean it up. Sir. What? Granny... What? No, I don't have a cat. - Say sorry. - Why? Say sorry to granny. Sorry. Sorry to whom? Granny, sorry. Forget it. - Don't talk shit again. - What did you say? Sorry! Got it, I understand. Can I go now? Boss. Boss, what again? What will you do if there is cat shit again? I will clean it up. Come to me. I don't have a cat. I really don't... Granny, everything is fine. What? You kicked her out, she slept in the trash station last night. I gave her money to rent a place to stay. What? You want her to go rent a motel at the midnight? I want to date her, but I'll take care of my job first. Why did you give her a bad time?! Let me tell you, she is mine. Don't try to stop me. Granny, what? - I am leaving. - Where are you going? He is not a good guy. You treated him so bad, he will return and seek revenge one day. Granny, don't be afraid, we are here. Why don't we call the police? Police? We are police. We are police. When did you two become policemen? Who is taking care of your dad's medicine factory? The factory that Viagra?! It closed down long time ago. Close down? Asshole, your father spent his life working on this. And you destroyed it now. You hit me?! I was already mad, but you still wanted to scare me with a knife... I swear I will kill you. Don't you think that a granny can just do whatever she wants... - How can you face your dad? - Don't try to stop me. You'd protect the granny. You are cold blooded asshole... You destroyed your father's... Something happened. Something happened. Granny, take your luggage back inside first. I will talk to you again after I go buy something. You dad will come back for you. You asshole. Put away your gun. I know, you don't have to worry. Sir, we have searched but we can't find your clothes. How long will dry cleaning take anyway? Why don't we repay your loss? My clothe is worth $2,000 and you are only giving me back $700. The receipt stated that the highest refund is $700. It's useless to scream at me. You are trying to cheat me. If you are unhappy with our decision, you can sue us. I don't think your clothes is that expensive. It's worth $2,000! I have a receipt for it. - Dress off now. - Okay. Hello, where? Okay.

So why did you beat him? Here is a hospital. Stop yelling. You can go now. Mom, I come to see you sooner. Thanks for using Brian's hotline. Press 1 for cantonese and press 2 for english. - Let's go. - Where? You don't have to leave, you can stay. Where are you going? No, I don't want to get kicked out. Don't worry, you can stay here as long as you want. - Are you sure? - Look at me. I am so Sincere! Change your school uniform first. - Don't just sit there and eat. - Okay. I want you to act as crazy as you can. - Can you do it? - Yes! - Can you? - Yes. Take out your clothes, make your hair looser. Be more open. Just let yourself go wild. Okay. - Where is Brian? - What?

Grandma, her house is now under decoration. She will stay here for a couple of days. Only couple of days. No problem, I have a room available. But behave yourselves, you two are still young. Okay, we won't do anything. Leung, go find yourself a girlfriend like Brian does. Come in... Come in... Come in... I think there is something wrong with this old lady. Why do you say so? Damn right. What are you doing? This phone... Is ko wan-on there? Yes, call him. Go ahead. - How is it? - No one answered. He must has gone to work. Your dad has a lot of business in jave. He cares his outlook very much. When he goes on a business trip, he brings 4, 5 pair of suits with him. One day he went out on a business trip... I want to see your image... From the reflection of the water. - Okay. - Say whatever you like. - Pretend that you are a reporter. - Okay. - Stand over here? - Okay. Mrs. chen fainted again. Good take!

It's cute. It is like... Listening to people sleeping behind a camp. What a lovely noise. It is his heartbeat. It's moving. Is he kicking? He kicked me. If you like it you can have one yourself. - Me? - Yes, go find yourself a wife. I don't think I know how to be a dad yet. I don't know what to do. Act like your dad. I don't know my dad. Just like him. It's not the same, he know what his mother looks like. His mother is not as irresponsible as his dad. His dad will come back. Even if he comes back... I will not let them meet. Life is strange. Some people don't even have a family. Someone even give up his family. Find him a new father. - Do you have any suggestions? - Me. You? I came to pick up my clothes and I have been waiting long. Sorry. - Good morning, granny, - Good morning. I have things to do, bye. Brian, get up. There is a thief. Let's go check it out. "Cold-blooded baudit strafe" "underground bank exposed" "4 brave policemen were killed" "5 were hit by stray bullets and seriously injured" thanks, Mike. Are you Mike? He left his telephone here. You are crazy. It's me, remember me, I threw the flower pot at you. Sorry. Sorry? Damn it, how dare you throw a flower pot at me?! Damn you! Leung... Leung, over here. Can you see me? Over here! Have some noodles. Granny, is that your son? Can you tell him stop throwing trashes out of his apartment? What? What trash? He just threw a pot out of his apartment and he almost killed me. Which one of your eyes saw him throw trash out of the window? Stop talking nonsense. - Sorry! - Are you trying to pick on me? I don't accept apology! How dare you bully an old lady like me? I am going to kill you! Try it! Come on! You got the wrong person... Stone gave us take information again. That person is not lighter. I was just playing air gun, why old you hit me so hard? You beated me up so badly! Sorry, man! Sorry?! You are crazy. Mr. lai, I want to talk to you. Take a rest. There is something we found... In your blood sample. You have a harrington dancing disorder. It is a very strange disorder. Mr. Kong. Mike, take a break from tomorrow. You will be on vacation until further notice. How can I deliver things to the station then? Brian, you follow prince from now on. Remember don't be late again. Let's go check out the victims. Mike, let's go to Thailand tomorrow, okay? Don't be late to work again. You really want me to follow him? If you want me to follow him it means sending me to hell. I can't live without you. Let's take vacation together. You can do it. Open the door. Granny, it's time for you... To go to the owner's meeting. I am not going, I am having a headache. You have to go, this meeting is very important. It is about this building's maintenance fees. You have to go. Leung, can you go for me? You can make decisions for me at the meeting, okay? I called for this meeting today it js because I have a report to you. There are three owners... Who haven't paid for the maintenance fees. Flat 8a, 2c and 5c. We haven't seen the owner of 5c for a long time. What do you think we should do? Your clothes are ready. Come pick it up when you have time. Well, let's go to another topic. I won't bother you anymore, bye! Let's talk about the maintenance fee. Is it agreed by all flat owners? No more discussion, dismiss now. But this building needs maintenance. I know! But who'll pay it? We'd share the fee evenly. I don't think the maintenance is necessary. I think it's a must, I'll pay it no matter how much it costs. Let's share it. I think this young man has a great idea. He's brave, passionate and calm. I think he should be the president of our board of owners. I agree! Okay... Chairman, congratulation. Chairman. This disorder will cause the person to lose control of their muscle... You will not be able to control your temper. The disorder will get worse when you get older. After the cells in your central nervous system are damaged, you will lose your ability to think. You will slowly become mentally retarded. I know about it long time ago. If you discover you're starting to lose control of your muscle. You have to come back to us. Do you hate me? Don't worry, I won't bother you too long. I will leave. I will go away for sure and you won't be able to find me. Why aren't you talking? I always look at myself in the mirror, I don't think I'm disgusting. Right, I don't use my brain. Little girls are like this. Use my brain? I will wait until I am older. I will act like you guys, think of everything and trouble myself. Why don't I stop using my brain right now? I am going to sleep, good night Mike. I will go get your clothes first. I want to help you feed your kid. I will get it for you... - Can you? - Yes... it is very interesting. Granny, this is a massage chair. It has many functions. Means upper body massage. Look, lower body, it is moving. Right... Independent control. This is neck, waist. Back, butt, you try it. Neck. What? You have to push the button, granny! I can't read, how can I control it? Forget it, you'll serve me anyway. Very interesting... Granny, we'll pack up... And get out of here. You still want to stay 6 more months? No, my son won't like it when he comes back. No. I will cook for you tonight. After the meal, you can leave. Let me help you granny. Come Brian, sit down... Look, this is your father! When he was young he had little hair. I and your grandfather so worried about him. We rubbed his head with wine... So he had more hair. This is grandma. Was grandma pretty? Very pretty. Very pretty, really? If I were pretty... Your grandpa wouldn't have run away with another slut. I did nothing wrong, I really didn't. I just wanted to see you two! You two better don't act like them. By the way, ask your girlfriends to come to dinner tonight. Granny, let me help you. What can you do to help? I can help you taste it. - Taste it? - Yes! Does it taste good? - You are a pig. - So are you. It tastes good! - Let me help you. - Where is granny? She is cooking in the kitchen. Whatever she says, don't take it serious, okay? Don't steal things to eat. Granny... Daughter-in-law, you are here. This is a gift for you. Thank you very much. - I made you bird's nest soup. - I want some too. Are you pregnant? Only pregnant lady can have it? Right, I want some too. Okay... Each will get one after dinner. - Are you bored? - No! I haven't eaten with so many people for a long time. It's time! Let him get used to this kind of environment. Get used to the happy atmosphere. When he born he will be happy and energetic. - The things you said this afternoon... - I am serious. But do you know it takes a lot of money to raise a child? Don't treat us this good. - I can't repay you. - You don't have to. Why do you give yourself so much pressure? You are not him... Sorry, I didn't mean that. No... didn't I tell you... That I didn't know who my parents were when I was born. I lived in the orphanage when I was little. That's why I want to know... What it feels like to raise a children. Give me a chance. Come on... Give me hand. - Pull open the table. - Clean it. Sit. Granny, why are you crying? Granny, what's wrong? What's wrong? I forgot to cook rice. This special club sandwich is really tasty. This giant hamburger looks good. My spicy bean curd pizza looks good too. And you? I want a giant hot dog! Can you be serious a little! Sir, who are you looking for? I remember you, you must be living in flat 5c. You don't come back often. You owe us 3 months of management fees. It will be nice if you pay for the months of April, may and June. It will help if you pay now. Does it taste good? You have to eat more. You need for two persons. What? Chairman, the owner of flat 4c refused to pay the maintenance fee. Why don't you go talk to him? I am eating. That fool doesn't come back here often. You go check it out, it won't take long.
