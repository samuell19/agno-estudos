Unlisted I'm sorry I don't have the time to see your mother. It's ok. - How is she doing? - Fine, but she still suffers from her back. - Doesn't she have a masseuse? - She does, but... I don't know. It seems ineffective and very expensive. See you. By the way, I have a diner tonight, I'll be home late. I'll pick the children at school. - Really? - Yes, i've informed their teacher. Ok. Ciao. To the "Etoile" please. Ok. Look at this... asshole! Have you seen? What about the turn signal? People are so... They think Paris is theirs. Don't you drive? My car's at my office. That's where we're going. You work at the "Etoile"? - Yes, on the Champs Elys?es. - Isn't it noisy? Nothing unbearable. - I've lived there for five years. - On the Champs Elys?es? On the main road? Well... I've got used to it. I've moved to "Nation, Christian Dewet". A very quite street, charming. - Christian Dewet? - You know the place? Sure! The little one parrallel to Pipus street near Nation. - My wife's brother lives there. - Really? It's quiet. Absolutly. Sir! I'm sorry. Could you please take me to the Defense? - Well... - I'm so late! - I'm really sorry. - It's ok. It's very kind of you. - You're lovely. - I'm getting of at the Etoile. It's perfect. How lucky I am. I'm sorry, I have no money. I was already late when I figured I had forgotten my wallet. I went back to take it then I headed to Saint-Augustin subway. But the traffic was stopped because of an accident. What a bad day to commit suicide... Luckily I met you. Thanks. You're welcome. Sir, can I smoke in your cab? It's weird, I feel like I know you. - Really? - Yes, I've already seen you. Don't you remember me? What's your name? Sorry... - May I know your name? - Antoine. - Antoine de Laplane. - Antoine de Laplane. How poetic! - What do you do for a living? - I'm in publishing. What's your name? Lucie Chapiteau. I have troubles with remembering people's face. I... Why is this here? Sorry. I often meet people I... You what? Well... I... I'm not sure I know them. I don't know. Maybe... I... I went to Paris 3. - Did you study there? - No. No, it's only your eyes. They are funny. You look like Droopy. - I like them. - The dog? It's hot! - Aren't you hot? - No, I'm fine. I'm always hot. The sun makes my head aches. Sir, do you have a radio? Can we have some music? Have you seen this movie? No. The main actor is awesome! - Really? - Totally! What's his name? Don't you know? Me and movies... What's his name? I can only think about John Wayne. How irritating! It's... It's... This guy is so charismatic. That much. - Won't you make fun of me? - Why would I? - I'm sure you will. - No! Go ahead. I think I'm a nymphomaniac. Why would I... laugh about that? It must be hard for you. Maybe the term is a bit strong. Is it so bad? I can't stop thinking about it. All the time. - All the time? - All day long. Every minute. I should be cured. In example, I could kiss you. Althought I don't know you - Right now? - Yes. You don't believe me? You don't believe me? You should see your face! Sorry. Yes? - I'm still in the cab. - Who is it? Who's talking? The radio. Don't worry, I took it. See you tonight. You must think I'm crazy. Not at all. You too, sir, want a kiss? I have a theory. It may sound crazy. But I think all our lives are lead by sex. Consciously or unconsciously. And also by death. Death is what we're running away from. - Do you agree? - Totally. Except for the asshole who committed suicide this morning. But apart from death, I think sex is the only thing who lead us. It's true. We're always trying to seduce someone in a way or another. It's more than seduction. Everything is about it. But maybe I shall be cured... Look, when I do this... - I'm just kidding! - Sure. I'm almost arrived. You're really so lovely! I'd like to invite you for dinner tonight. - Really? - Yeah. At my home. Are you free? Well... It will be a pleasure. Do you have a pen so that I write the address? Sure. - Here. - Thanks. Don't lose it. Let's say... 9.00? Ok. Here sir. - Keep the change. - Thank you sir. Thank you. See you tonight Antoine de Laplane. See you. - Goodbye sir. - Goodbye. So... we're going to the Defense? No. Back to Saint-Augustin actually. Go... yes, there. We'll have a quick stop to pick up the... The lady over here. So? He swallowed it all. I'll meet him tonight. Really? What did you say? I told... what we planned. How did you say it? To Nation now sir. Please. I'm fed up with this guy! I'll kill him! I'll kill him! Shit! I'll get divorced. That jerk... You'll have the children. I'll do my best tonight. Come at 10:00 or 11:00. Don't be scared, B?atrice. I'm so surprised. It's 182 Francs. No sorry, I owe you money. No, keep the change. Thank you Madam. - Good bye Sir. - Good bye Madam. Goodbye. Have a nice day. Shit... What a... Hello. I'm looking for Antoin de Laplanne's phone number. Christian Dewet Street, 12th block. Dewet. D, E, W, E, T, sorry. Really? He's unlisted? Ok, thank you. Too bad for him.
