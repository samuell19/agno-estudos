[PHONOGRAPH PLAYING] Damn you, Mario! You're too much! I just gave you your allowance the other day. Now, you're asking for more? You think money comes out of my ass? Son of a bitch! Take your seat. You have no idea how hard it is for me to earn money. I worked hard for it. I've invested my sweat and blood just to give you what you want. Your clothes Your money, your allowance All the stuff in this house you could lose all of it. But if you know how to use your brain, no one can take that away from you! That's the only legacy I can leave you. You idiot! I'm sick and tired of hearing your mother complaining every day. Right, Chabeng? Your mom is so worried about you. You come home late. You don't help out in the store. All you do is try to be cute! What's with you? Stop fooling around. When I was young it was your grandma who sent me to school. You're lucky you have parents who pay for your studies. This idiot. All you do is try to be cute! You think you're handsome? I still look far better than you. Asshole. Get out of my sight, I don't want to talk to you anymore. Go up to your room now! To your room! Now! Arrogant. When you're 18, you don't care about other people. You only see what you want to see. Whatever excites you. Whatever looks good. You are not yet aware of what is actually around you. You just don't care about the world yet. You're free. [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] Embarrassing as it may be, this was when I started peeping. There's a saying– ''The eyes are the windows to one's soul.'' [WOMAN MOANING] They say that there's beauty in everything. But not everyone has the ability to see it. [MOANING INTENSIFIES] Hey, get up now. Or your boss will knock your head off. But you already knocked my head off. Fuck you! Hurry, go get ready. Istepanie– ''STE-FA-NEE!'' Thanks for... - For? - Coming. Jerk! Got to go now. I have work. When I come home okay... later. Promise, after work. I'll be late. Damn! You like this, don't you? [CHUCKLES] I said later. - Here you go. There. - Ouch! [CELL PHONE RINGING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, Ma'am? Good morning! Hello, Manda. Are you fully awake? Come over, I want to show you something. Wide awake, Ma'am! Coming. This is still Peeping... But this time we're high tech! [STATIC CRACKING] Why is it like that? Everything seems to be pretty normal. Might be a bit less. Might be just right. You don't know. You just go with the flow. Then one day, it can all change in the blink of an eye. You're no longer the same as how you were before. Chief Torre, good morning! This is Sgt. Ara Lazaro. And she will be a part of this assignment. You may take your seat. Okay, attention! This is Salvador Ventura A.K.A Badong. 35 years old, single, businessman. Art smuggler by day, drug trafficker by night. We've been tailing him for six months now. And finally, the agency was able to put audio and video surveillance devices in their house slash drug den on San Isidro street, in one of the alleys in Caloocan City. And we're expecting a big transaction very soon. Most probably with a big fish– a prominent public official. But we can't be too sure about it. So, we need a lot more surveillance work. So, our station will be a block away from the target nest. - Victoriano and Ureta. - Ma'am? You will be assigned during the day. - You will be Team Uno. - Copy. Manda, Lazaro, night shift. - Team Dos. - Copy, Ma'am. You all know the drill. Any questions? Ma'am, why does it have to be Manda who gets to partner with the new... You have a problem with that? - I'm just kidding. - How about you? Okay, we're done. You son of a bitch, I'm not an addict! You son of a bitch, I'm not an addict! Keep moving! I'm not an addict! Oh, don't treat him like that. - You son of a bitch! - That's enough, Ma'am. - You're an addict! Addict! - Ma'am! - Son of a bitch! - Ma'am, stop. [JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING] You can't even find a job! You moron! You invited me for coffee but you ordered a cold drink. It suddenly feels so hot. - Yeah, right. - Here, wanna try? No thanks, I'm good with my coffee. I'm also getting hot in here. It might be good for us to hang out a little since we will be working together in the next few nights. True. Can you take that camera off your neck, please? Do you always have to carry that with you? Oh, sorry. It's a habit. Hobby or habit? Or work-related? ''Both of them three.'' This was actually given to me by my father. This is what I wanted to be when I was growing up. I like taking pictures. I once dreamed of working for a newspaper. But newspapers are not a thing anymore these days. Everything now is online, even the news. So true. So how did you end up here? My Uncle Johnny is a cop. Why are you not clean-cut? I'm undercover. I see. So, what characters have you played so far? I was once a vendor, a homeless man. A bum. Where? In the Bergong Bridge, in Las Piñas. And your cover has never been cracked? Method acting. Well, you do look like a... Hey, watch your words. You do look like a good actor. Kinda. How about you, where have you been before? Just desk jobs. This is my first time out on the field. I think I can learn a lot from you. But of course. Remember the saying– ''If you are not willing to learn, no one can help you.'' ''But if you are determined to learn, no one can stop you!'' Nice! I already learned something new! There's actually one more, it goes– ''In learning, you will teach. And in teaching, you will learn!'' - That was a good one. - And here's another– ''No amount of learning can cure stupidity.'' I have also read– ''We meet stupid people every day.'' Then? That's it. Nice. That's very... enlightening. Ara. Got to go, Brad is here. I'll go ahead now. - Okay. - See you. - Hello, babe. - Hi! Hello. - How are you? - Good. - Shall we? - Let's go. Alright. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Here's the log. Did you log in? Don't forget, just put everything there. What's taking him so long? - Still not here? - I bet he won't show up. I can work overtime. Me too. [CHUCKLES] We rented a tenement unit that has a billiard hall underneath. So, we can monitor Badong's drug den which is located around a busy area. Near a cafeteria, a store and a tricycle terminal. Where there are lots of people. All kinds of people. Hello! I'm Jen, Landlady. - Hi! I'm Mario. - Hi, Mario. Hey. Are you the Madrigals? Yes, we are the Madrigals. [CHUCKLING] I'll go ahead, Ma'am. Are you done transferring your stuff? - Yes. Everything's good. - Oh, okay. Alright. Wait. Your family is so cute. You're all so close. Oh, yes. Imagine, sharing the same house with your cousins. Will you be having your prayer meeting there too? Yes, we'll actually be having our prayer meeting here. That would also be a good time for us to bond. - I see. - Yes. See you, Ma'am. Wait. Feel free to let me know if you need anything. Got it. Stuff, like, you know, ironing your clothes. Got it. Thanks again, Ma'am. Bye. You're too early. For tomorrow. [BOTH LAUGH] Here, log in here. ''Early to bed and early to rise'' ''makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.'' [LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY] Making fun of me. We're getting on his nerves. You guys behave, okay? [GIGGLING] [GIBBERING] Hi! Boss, have some beer. [SLOW-BEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Cheers! Here, maybe you want coffee now. [MUGS CLINK] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I'll go ahead, boss. Here's your beer, Georgia. It's late, where have you been? I told you I'll be at Camille's parlor. I actually invited her to come over but a customer came for a hair rebond. Camille? Are you serious? She comes here often. You shouldn't trust her. What's with you? Camille is also a user. She even sells to her customers. And why are you yelling at me? I'm not dumb! I know how this business works. I was here when this gang was just growing, remember? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GEORGIA GASPING] [ARA CLEARS THROAT] [GEORGIA MOANING] [CAMERA CLICKING] [MOANING LOUDLY] More. Fuck me harder! [BOTH MOANING] - Surprise! - Surprise! Team Uno checking in. Team Dos packing up. How's everything? Getting bored? Anything exciting happen last night? Nothing? Silence, huh? Okay, bye. Let's check out the footage then. Ara... Nevermind. [ENGINE STARTING UP] How's your new assignment? Same thing... boring. What about you? Same. Well, what do you expect in a call center? Calls? You're a call girl, aren't you? That's what you fancy, right? Call girls? Here, there's no poison in that. - That was quick. - Hand me the lighter. What do you think of coffee? Fuck you! I know where those lines are headed. Does it taste good? Which one? I already know how good I taste but that's not what I'm asking about. It's salty. But, it's fine by me. Just right. Since you're not tired, you clean up here. [SIGHS] Okay. [CHIPS CRACKLING] My dad asked me to bring you here. He said I should teach you. Looks like he really trusts you. I'm not used to hearing him say things like that about someone. Tell me your secret. How did you earn my father's trust? Nothing really. I've known your dad for a long time now. He's like a father to me. In fact, he's the reason why my family has a better life now. He helped us big time. [YAWNS] Still no action? Yeah, so boring. Should I switch the channel? My dad's the best. For him, loyalty is everything. As long as you stay true to him, everything will be fine. Just like with girls. But dad also mentioned that you wanted to go home. I thought you were happy here. I am happy here. But it's been quite a while since I last went home. Why, did someone get sick? No one. Then why go home? It's been a while now since I last went home. Maybe you wanna leave the gang. No, it's not that. I'm actually happy here. I just need to go home. By the way, how's my dad's collection of saints? All good. I clean them every day, just like your dad instructed. Is that why the Sto. Niño has a cracked back? What crack? I don't know anything about a crack. You don't know what's inside? He trusted you, Boying! Sir Badong, I really have nothing to do with that. Fuck you, Boying! My dad would always say– ''It's better to have an enemy who hits you straight up'' ''than a friend who attacks you from behind.'' Fuck you, Boying! What now? Fuck, man. That's the action I'm talking about. What now? Fuck you! Fuck you all! You're all fools! [GROANS] It's good that we didn't change the channel. Wait, what do we do now? Relax. Zero response. These are small fish. We're aiming for the big one. [CAR APPROACHING] After this storm, things will be calm again. Nothing else will probably happen tonight. Yeah, let's have a drink. Okay. Let's go. [GEORGIA MOANING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Enteng! - Fuck. - Enteng! Open the door! - Boss! What's taking you so long? Boss! Bad people might barge in here, that's why I... Why the fuck did you have to lock it? Want some coffee, boss? - What are you talking about? - Coffee. Beer! Beer? Alright, boss. You're probably up to no good here. Never, boss. I'm all alone here. Cheers, Boss! You can count on me, boss. Why did you have to lock the door then? [SNORING] Wow, just like in TV dramas. Stay tuned for the next episode. [BOTH CHUCKLING] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [BANGS, THUDS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] I grew up in the streets. It was pretty much where I got my education. I learned a lot. Math. Science. And literature. ''I BET YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR DICK WHILE READING THIS'' They're right. The camera never lies. It can see right through anyone. If you may, sir, please give us some privacy. Bloody intruder! Wow, the surveillance video of Team Dos was really something, huh? It bested all the videos we've seen so far. Yeah, the scenes rock! Georgia literally skewed the boss and his sidekick. Our videos are nothing compared to this. Unlike here, no action! They're all studs! It's like watching a fencing match! That's the Councilor. Big fish! Well, not that big. It's crocodiles we're hunting for, not fish. [SNIFFLES] It's two weeks before the elections. I remember when I was about to join Ka Turing in one of the float trucks with the Mayor. It was a long convoy. Lots of colorful buntings. Like the float trucks in a parade... Just like a fiesta! I even brought candies with me... I was ready to throw them out to the crowd. - Is that okay? - Yes. It's my turn now. One, two, three. I think I ate too much crab during lunch so my stomach ached. It's his fault because he kept on serving me more crab. I thought the pain would go away if I farted, but I felt something else come out. So, I just decided to stay behind and not join them. Ka Turing was even laughing at me while saying, [SOBBING] ''How can you be my assistant? You have a bad stomach.'' Yes, because once you sit in office, you have a lot to stomach. [LAUGHING] What do you mean? I don't understand why it had to be that way. Ka Turing could have been a great councilor. Who would've wanted something like that to happen? After 30 minutes, someone threw a grenade at them. Good thing the Mayor managed to escape. Who would wish for that to happen? Tell me. But perhaps that was God's plan for Ka Turing. And you? Look at you. now you're The Counsilor. You gained the sympathy of the people. You are Councilor Cadhit. All because of your upset stomach. [LAUGHING] And now that you're the Councilor. It's now you, whom they cannot stomach. [LAUGHING CONTINUES] Fuck you! You know, just because we grew up together with his dad doesn't mean you can joke around like that. Don't forget that you're my assistant. Whatever you say or do is a reflection of me. What about the investigation of Ka Turing's death? Is there any development? Do they have a suspect? Please. Let's talk about it another time, please. [BLOWING] [SOFT GUITAR PLAYING] [FLUTE PLAYING ALONG] How long will it take, Pedring? I'm just fixing this temporarily, okay? Your fuel filter is clogged. Better to have it changed. Even your radiator, it's starting to crack now. It might dry up. Soon this will overheat. Then you'll have a big problem. Believe me. You know. Your car is like your own body. Maintenance is important. You have to caress it. You know... when you run out of water in your body, you'll get dehydrated. That's why you need a lot of water. You need to hydrate. You need to change the oil. Change oil. That's a must. Regularly. Do you get it? Hey! - Do you get it? - Yeah. Just work on it, okay? Yes I think you do get it! Your engine will really break down with her! Just work on it, please. Sir! Yes, sir! Hey, remember what I always tell you! Keep your friends close and your zipper open. [YAWNS] So, what's the latest? So far... none. How about you? What's up? Personal, or professional? Everything is personal! I'm having problems with Brad. Who's Brad? Oh, Brad! Why? What happened? What a shame. Jerk! Just kidding. Tell me, what's the problem? He's always out of town for business. And I'm busy, too. Maybe having a cop as a girlfriend is too much for him. Me, I'm okay with having a police girlfriend. But kidding aside, everything will be fine. How long have you been together? Two years. But that's fine, it was always gonna end up like this anyway. But hey, that's still tough. Even those hoodlums in Las Piñas I was monitoring them for six months, I miss them. You're crazy! But then there's a saying– It's better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone so far. As they say– I'd rather have bad times– We're out of coffee. I'll go buy more. Good choice. I was really about to suggest that. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SLURRING] - ♪ We are Filipinos ♪ - Stop watching too much KPop. Here comes a chick. Hey, miss, you want to come with us? Come with us. - Would you– - Fuck you! - We were just playing around. - Go ahead. - Go ahead, perverts. - It was just a joke. Fucking cowards! You, fucker! Please, don't! Nice, I reached my quota for tonight. I reached my quota! I reached my quota! You wanna say something? Don't you dare, asshole What are you looking at? You motherfuckers! You, fuck you! You can't do anything now, I reached my quota! You, you wanna take a fight with me? Say something– You okay, miss? I'm fine. Thank you so much, miss. That's okay. It just happened by chance. You're so tough. But that was risky. I'm used to taking risks. I guess we have that in common. How can I return the favor? No need for that. I just live nearby, you know. I live on the next block. Can I invite you now for some snacks? Here I bought some anyway. Please? I assure you, I'm a good person. Badong. Ana. You know what, Ana. What snacks did you buy? Oh, these? [MOANING OVER LAPTOP] - [OVER THE LAPTOP] Faster! - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Boss! Boss! Boss! - Boss! - Come on in. - Enteng, this is Ana. - Hi. - Good evening. - She's pretty, boss. Have a seat. Can we get some beer? Oh yes, sure Boss. Here, boss. - And for you beautiful lady. - Thank you. I almost got into a fight at the store, good thing Ana came just in time. Really, boss? You should've brought me along with you. Sorry about him. Shit! Don't try to explain. I saw everything. Good thing you're safe. Oh, fuck! Why? I forgot to buy coffee. Chief Inspector Torre decided to use Ara as an asset within the syndicate. I was against it, but Ara was determined that it's a good idea. Change of assignments- Team Uno for the night shift. Team Dos now takes the daytime shift. One-two. When you enter, your assault could carry a long one then the other can just have a pistol. Same thing with you guys. This could be the hottest show you'll ever see. So, watch carefully. This mission is crazy. Even crazier than all my undercover duties combined. Yeah, but I'll manage. I'm already in anyway. Ara... Take care of yourself. Oh, he's concerned about me. Not at all. You're all on your own. It's over. Between me and Brad. Brad who? Oh, Brad. Sorry. Did it hurt? That small? Asshole! Of course, it hurts, but I'll be fine. Then let's toast. To strong and independent women! We didn't discuss Ara's love life anymore. She doesn't know that I'm slowly falling for her. Same with her. Maybe. Could be. Slightly. Kinda. Not sure. We just focused on the mission. [CHUCKLES] My arm felt numb. [WAITER IN THE BACKGROUND] Get outta here! [WAITER IN THE BACKGROUND] Hey, your turn, guys! Meanwhile, she's slowly getting closer to Badong. She's gaining the enemy's trust. Two months passed by. [ARA LAUGHING] Seriously? And they believed your stories? Yes. Remember you're the one who told me– To use my body and personality to make them believe me. To try to make it extraordinary besides, they're my own experiences. So, everything seems real. I mean, it is real. So, it's true that you stabbed your maniac teacher? No. I just hit his head with a bottle. Stupid! You're a maniac too, that's why you wanna make sure. Not at all. Actually, I've been restraining myself. [CLEARS THROAT] [PARTY WHOOPING] [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Happy birthday! Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! - Thank you! Thank you! - Cheers! - Cheers! [CHUCKLES] Here we go, here we go. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hey! - Here we go, here we go. - There. There. - It's getting hot now. - Come to papa! There you go. - Oh, my! - There you go! Intense. - There. - This is a good shot. Damn! - Wait, why are you recording it? - Bug off. - I know what I'm doing. - Up to you. This is for my personal recording. We've been waiting for this. Here we go, here we go! This guy will join in now. There. That's it. I first tried it because of my Uncle Junior. Then I got addicted to it. Then started selling it. When Uncle Junior got killed, that's when I started to hide. I was mad and wanted to get back at them but I just chose to distance myself. I admire your guts. You can hang out with us in your free time. I want to get to know you more. My friends also want to meet you. Sorry, I just got carried away. Ara, don't fall for him. Ouch! That hurts! Sorry. It's your fault. ''Sorry,'' yet it's my fault? I can't do that, you know. It's just a job. Sorry again. Does it still hurt? Just right. What's with you? Why are you in a hurry? What the heck! What's gotten into you, Badong? Stop! No, Badong. [MOANING] Ara... Didn't you say, this is all work? [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] Madrigal family! Madrigal family! Hello! Are you one of the Madrigals? No, I'm Mario's friend. - Oh, you're his friend? - Yes. You're too noisy. The other units are complaining that there's too much noise in your unit. Sorry about that, Madam. You see there's a rat here. Rodents? Rats? - In your unit? For real? - Yes. - Are you sure... - Madam Jen! - Mario. - How are you? Are there really rats? Yes, Madam Jen, but everything's okay now. - I see. - Yeah. Can you also look for the rats in my house? Sure. Alright, then. Madam Jen, we really appreciate your concern. - No worries. All for you, Mario. - Thanks. - See you around. - Is she a Madrigal? Mario, just tell me if you need anything, okay? - Sure. Thank you. Bye. - Bye! Thank you. Hand me the logbook. Have you logged in? Can I have a light, please? [SPITS] [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] Thanks, bro. Let's go. You've been drinking a lot of coffee lately. We ran out of coffee grounds. But don't you worry, I already bought you a refill. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Mario, go fix your life once and for all. All you do is mess with other people's lives. Everyone is under your surveillance. Make sure you don't get caught. You'll end up either dead or in jail. If you die and you leave this world with nothing in your head, we'll just weep for you for only a few months. And after that no more. Life goes on! Why do we have to suffer for you, damn it! Dad, enough of this, please? I'm doing my best, okay? Look at me, I'm a police officer now. I'm trying to do good now. Just focus on your studies. Study harder. Here, don't spend it all at once. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CAMERA CLICKS] Jing. Jing, right? Yes, sir. How old are you? I'm 21, sir. Sir Mars. Thanksss for letting me joins Team Dos. What? I actually have no choice. It's the chief who assigned you here. Sir, I assures you, I won't lets you down. What? I will not disappoint you, sir. Oh, really? Just kidding. I know that you'll do your best. But of courses, sir. Oh, Cookings! [CREAKING] Fuck! Sir! Where are you goings? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [MARIO GROANS] [SIGHS] [CLICKING] [DOOR OPENS] Sir, where did you goes? What are they doing now? Eatings. What? - They're eating! - What? Are you sure? Ouch! Thats hurts, sir! Stops it! [BOTTLES CLINK] Ara. I noticed you fancy Badong. I'm worried you might fall for him and turn your back on us. You should know me by now. You know, how dedicated I am to this job. I'm sorry. I'm just concerned about you. Fuck you! You're hitting on Ana, aren't you? What? You jerk! You're hitting on her, aren't you? - Admit it! - I don't get it. You are hitting on Ana. - You're not gonna admit it? - Why? Are you jealous? [WHOOPING] Come to papa! [MOANS] Boss, here, I brought some snacks. Fucking Enteng! I'm gonna shoot this guy. That's a shame! Boss, let's eat. Here, boss. What's that? Some snacks, boss. Fuck you both! They were turning on the lights and you guys were still inside. Because Nick here was trying to be daring. - Yeah, too daring actually. - It was Raymond's birthday. - I'm sorry, who? - Raymond. He was telling us that he was with a girl inside. Never trust everything you see. They say that the most important things in life are the ones that cannot be seen. Oh! But what about you? You're important... yet I can very much see you. [GULPING] [COUGHS] Hi, cutie! We're about to close now. You can continue that tomorrow. You want to stay overnight? Do you already have a place to stay? You can stay here if you want, for free. Hey, Roxy! Come to bed now. Go ahead! - Or I'll knock your head off! - I'm just trying to be sweet here. I said go ahead. Sorry about that, cutie. Would you like to stay for the night? It's free. What do you say? You can stay for free. You're so cute, you know. Just stay, please? It's free anyway. Hey, cutie! Cutie! Damn it! - Oh, what a waste. - Roxy! What did I say? I said go ahead! How annoying! Ana, after this transaction, I want to start a new life. And I want you to come with me. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] We waited for this day. It's like the big night in beer houses. It's like the climax in sex. But who would've thought that it would all end up in... jealousy? We'll meet at dad's warehouse at 5:30 PM. Then we're pulling out at 6 PM. For sure they will be hunting us after this transaction. Better to split up in the meantime. Perhaps for two months. Enteng. Boss. - You're in charge here. - Sure, boss. Let's all settle and be away for a while. Including you, Georgia. Me? Why me? Don't you want that? - I've forgiven you. - What are you talking about? You're free to do whatever you like now. I've already forgiven you and Enteng. What the fuck are you talking about? You see, I have eyes here. 24/7. You piece of shit! You don't fucking respect the privacy of the people here! Who do you think you are? Are you trying to leave me because of this bitch? Don't turn the table on me now. You're running off with her, aren't you? You bitch! Cut it out, Georgia! Fuck you! - Fuck you, Georgia! - Go! Go! You can't fool me! [PISTOL FIRING] [GUNSHOTS CONTINUE] [EPIC MUSIC BUILDING UP] [POLICE SIREN WAILING] [PEOPLE CLAMORING] Excuse me! Excuse me! Wait a minute. [WHISPERING] Son of a bitch! Bloody hell! [IN LOCAL DIALECT] Pesky devil! Son of a bitch! Who would've thought that my son will post such a thing? - I thought he was just on Tiktok. - It was your fault. - Of course, I was so fucking bored. - Now, we're in trouble. We're in deep shit. [TELEPHONE RINGING] How's Team Uno? I heard they're involved in a viral video scandal. Yeah. Wally left his phone lying around the house. His son got interested in the video and uploaded it online. Didn't respect others' privacy. They're outrageous. I don't think I can watch those kinds of stuff anymore. I'm sick of them. I'm back at my desk job now. That's okay. Get well so they would give you another mission and I hope we can work together again. Thank you. Thanks for what? For everything you've taught me. Remember the saying... If you are not willing to learn– Yeah, right. Okay, then. I'll go ahead now. Can I have a light, please? Thanks! When you're 18, you don't care about other people. You just see what you want to see. Whatever that excites you. Whatever that is pretty. You are not yet aware of what is actually around you. You just don't care yet about the world. You're still free. The world is messed up. There's crime everywhere. Nothing is discreet anymore. We know who's doing it. All happening before our very eyes. The question is what do we do? Manda, always keep your eyes wide open. Never blink. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Keep your eyes wide open. Don't get corrupted. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
