Big gold nuggets the size of them there, them there pool balls. Texas Curly, the only gold in that big hole is in your teeth when you're down in it! [MEN LAUGHING] More like fool's gold. CURLY: You're the fool. I want you all to know that I just found me the fattest vein of gold in the whole damn world! [LAUGHING] Yeah, I'm richer than all of you! I'm rich. [ALL LAUGHING] Where in the Grand Canyon did you find this gold? Where did I find the gold? Wouldn't you like to know? Tell us, Texas Curly, tell us where the gold is, huh? It's, it's at a place where only eagles can fly. Eagles? [SNICKERS] You're flyin', all right. You're flyin' off the handle like an old fool! And it's guarded by the ghost of an old Apache warrior. Ghosts? Yeah. And if you try to take my find, he'll cut your throat. Is there any truth to his words? Well, he drinks a good yarn. But everybody knows, there ain't no gold in the Grand Canyon. I heard your lyin' mouth, Ruby Muldoon! [GROANING] [LAUGHS] You know, old man, I could beat that gold out of you and still not have a cent left! Take it easy! Easy, pal, we still got a game to finish before you go bustin' up that cue. [GRUNTING] MAN 1: He's got a gun on him, right? Yeah, I guess you're right, pal.

Who? Howdy! What're you doin'? Fingerin' the dog. What's he doin'? Fingering the dog. Where's that pretty little girl you was with? Hell, a tramp like that could be halfway to Phoenix with a truckload of drunk Indians by now. Reckon so. Evenin'. Evenin'. Those lowlifes killed Texas Curly! Stay down! She's there in the Studebaker. [TIRES SCREECHING] Hang on. Here they come. Yeah. Come on, come on, come on. Take the wheel.What? Take the wheel! I don't know how to drive! Take it! Pull over or I'll blow your brains out! [TIRES SCREECHING] [ENGINE DYING] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [BOTH WHEEZING] [BREATHING DEEPLY] Now you know how to drive. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Well, do you think I should tell the sheriff what I saw? I'm for mindin' my own business. You can do what you want. Hey, don't I get the bed tonight? You owe me $150, not including expenses. Well, if I pay you the money I owe you can I sleep in the bed alone? Yeah. Sure. Here. That's more than twice what I owe you. That's mine! You stole this off a dead man's body. And I thought you were a good girl under all that hot sauce! I didn't steal it! You've got it all wrong. [THUNDERCLAPS] Did you roll up the window in the car? Damn it, I didn't! Why me, Lord, why me? I didn't steal that pouch! It fell out of his pocket when he came out of the pool hall. Hey! Didn't anybody teach you manners? Half of all that's mine. Texas Curly's map. The gold mine! Yeah. Hey, something's written on this. "Please deliver my belongings "to Missus Emma Langston of Sioux City, Ioway, "my beloved wife who I left 35 years ago "for another woman. "Tell Emma "the other woman run off after the third night I was with her." You got the bed. Do you think there really is gold in the Grand Canyon? I'd say I'm gonna sleep on it. [CLUCKING] [DOG BARKING] You wait here.Why? When you can pay your own way, then you can do what you want. [DONKEY BRAYING] [MAN CHATTERING] Onions. Be with you in just one minute. No hurry. Just one minute. [DOG BARKING] [MUMBLING] It's just a little dry, but it's really good. That comes to $16.75. Well, this is all I have. Well, let's see what you got. Oh, you're four dollars short. You give me credit, Mr. Krupp? Credit? Yeah. [LAUGHING] He wants credit. No credit. Give me one of those bracelets... No! ...and we'll just call it even. No, no!We'll call it even. No, I'm not gonna let you cheat me anymore! Well, then, just why don't you go someplace else if you ain't got the money? I, uh, found this out in the dirt. It must belong to you. [HUFFING] Take your goods and you get out of here. Vamoose! Get going! Giddap! [HUFFING] [STOMPING] [HENS CLUCKING] Don't you ever come in my place and do a thing like that again or I'll chew off your ear! Start chewing. What can I do for you, mister? I wanna buy a pack train to go prospecting in the Canyon. I was told that you could fill the bill. Is that cash or trade? Trade. What you got? '51 Studey with four new tires. [SOFTLY] Oh.

[WHEEZING] [CHUCKLING] Oh. Looking for the guy who owns that Studebaker outside. Traveling with a young gal. You boys are law? Yup. Well, he signed it over to me just after I sold him a pack train. Ain't stolen, is it? How much of a head start's he got on us? I reckon about a half day. Say, what'd they do? Can you supply us with mules and grub? [DONKEY BRAYING] Yup. Say, what'd they do? Killed a fellow over in Show Low last night. What for? An old prospector. Said he found gold in the Grand Canyon. Gold? [LAUGHING] Well, I heard stories tell but I always thought that was just Indian legend. Gold? [EXHALING] Well, you're looking at the end of the rainbow, Wanda. WANDA: You really think so? You'd better hope so. You owe me another 25 bucks for the new duds you're wearing. I didn't ask you to buy them for me. Come on, let's ride. You lead. That's gotta be them. We'll kill 'em tomorrow. I want the girl. Strap, you've been married three times. I don't plan on marryin' her. Check your gun hand. [MIMICS GUNSHOTS] All right. WANDA: What if there ain't no gold? Why couldn't we get horses to ride? And what if we get lost and can't find our way back? Why did you have to trade the car? If there ain't no gold and we get back to the trading post, what then? Hey, when are we gonna make camp? I never should've brought you along. All you do is gripe. [HUMMING] BEAUDRAY: Whoa. Howdy. I reckon one of us started out a little late this morning. Well, it weren't me. I reckon you're right. What are you prospecting? Oh, a little silver. And gold! You seen any?Shh. [LAUGHS] Gold? Everybody knows there ain't no gold in the Grand Canyon. Yeah? What're you doing down here? If there'd be gold down there, you can bet your sweet britches Dutch Gravel'd found it by now. You ever hear of a guy named Texas Curly? I wouldn't believe that thieving sack of chicken guts if he was to tell me the world is round. He's been murdered. Tex is gone? Who done him in? BEAUDRAY: Could've been a lot of people. He was talking big about a rich strike he had down here in the Canyon. I told him that mouth of his would be the death of him. He said there were ghosts in the Canyon. Don't believe everything you hear or your nose would fall off. Come on, Imogene. [BRAYING]Easy. Careful. Come on now. Come on. I'm gonna fall off! Oh. I got you, girl. Hold on now. Whoa. Whoa. Come on. Come on. If I was you I'd turn back. Ah. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] Now I'd say this arrow's pointing north. Looks like south to me. Yeah? Well, we're heading north. Why do we always have to do it your way? 'Cause I got all the money and the guns. Good day, good people.Howdy. I saw a Bearded Tit this morning. Of course, it was a single sighting so probably no one will believe me. The river is rather turgid today or is it turbid? No, tumid. That's what it is. It's tumid. The ferryboat man will be here before dark. My name is Bitterstix. Merlin Bitterstix. That's a rather odd nomenclature for a biped, don't you think? You talk awful funny. Oh, I didn't realize. Well, perhaps you could give me some lessons. "Perhaps I could" and perhaps I won't, you fat varmint. Go on, get out of here. Go on. Go feed the mules. [EXHALING] That's rather heavy work. She's only a child. That child'll cut your heart out and feed it to the coyotes just for laughs. I find that a trifle difficult to believe. Believe what you want, but I wouldn't turn my back on her if I were you. [MIMICS BIRD SQUAWKING] [MIMICS BIRD SQUAWKING] [CHICKS CHIRPING] Well, anyway, my folks were murdered when I was nine years old. I saw it happen with my own eyes. Who would do such a fiendish thing? Black-hearted men. And Mr., uh, Mr. Demerille, what is he to you? He won me in a poker game. And until I can pay back $150 plus expenses, he can do anything he well pleases with me. Hi-ho. What if we run out of grub? What if we run out of water? What if you shut up? Uh, yeah, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up. Mr. Demerille, may I have a word with you? Talk fast. We'll be loading the ferry soon. Girl, go get the mules. Well, Wanda and I have been... Who? Uh, Miss Nevada and I have been chatting and she's told me about her unfortunate predicament. Yeah, I saw you two sneaking around down by the river. Well, she has had a frightful time of it. I'm afraid you don't understand the young woman's plight. What's your line of work, Mr. Bitterstix? I'm an ornithologist. You know what that is? I'd say you're for the birds. Go on, spit out what you got to say. Well, I'm prepared to pay you the $150 that Wanda owes you and furthermore, to give you $50 more for any inconvenience she might have caused you. What you gonna do to her? Why, I'm going to take her back to New Orleans with me and give her a decent home. Teach her to talk like a parrot. [SHOUTING] A parrot? WANDA: Watch out! He's going for his gun! [WHIMPERS] [BLOWING NOSE] She can leave anytime she damn well pleases. And as for the money she owes me ah, hell, I always knew she didn't have the guts to pay it back on her own. You can have her. I got no use for a little skunk. If I was you, though, I'd sleep with one eye open. [FERRYBOAT HONKS] Oh, he's an odd sort of duck, isn't he? [MIMICS BIRD HOOTING] Don't you think we should stay close by to Beaudray? Everybody knows there's no gold in the Grand Canyon. Cuckooricoo, Demerille! Let's go. Tell you one thing, Poker Joe, don't go getting mixed up with no young filly. Ride! Got a lot of leg but no head sense. [BRAYING] STRAP: Why ain't we catchin' up with 'em? 'Cause you keep stoppin' every ten minutes. It must've been your cooking last night. No, it's more like that Kraut bullet you took in the stomach you know, when you jumped in front of me? I did it for you. I didn't ask you to do it. I don't wanna talk about it. Well, what if there ain't no gold? What do we do then? There is gold. So let's move. Thanks. [WIND WHOOSHING] [MIMICS BIRD CHIRPING] Lovely evening, isn't it, my dear? It looks like rain. I see what you mean. It doesn't look like anything at all. That's very funny. You look like an old woman.I bet you say that to all the boys. I don't like old women, Wanda. I, uh, I guess it's about time to turn in, isn't it? I don't feel like turning in. Wanda, I want you to remember that it was I who saved you from that scoundrel. If you've got something to say, say it. Very well, I will. I saw you. I fell in love with you. You cross-eyed pervert! Yes, yes, that, too. Wanda, I believe you're afraid of me. I'm Wanda Nevada and I ain't afraid of nothing. That includes you. But I just want to touch you, stroke you... Hey, cut that out! So on. [WHOOSHING] [GASPING] [HOWLING] Poker Joe, she's gotta learn a little respect. Hell if I'm gonna go looking for her. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [COYOTES HOWLING] Wanda? Wanda? [ECHOING] Wanda? Wanda? Wanda! Wanda! Wanda. [BRAYING] Oh. Oh. [BOTH GROANING] Hey, man. We should've turned off at the last gorge, you know what I mean? No, these tracks don't look that old to me. Who the hell do you think you are? John Wayne, the great Indian tracker? I guess I might never should've brought you along. All you do is gripe. Partner, you'd gripe, too, if you had my problem. I've been drafted. They want me to go to Korea and fight for my country. You fought in the last one. Ruby, I don't wanna go back in the Army. Don't worry about it. We got, we got gold to find. Hey, come on, mount up. How far is it till we get to the gold? Hey, why don't you like me? Well, I never figured on you letting me ride off with that birdbrain, Bitterstix. Well, when you get to be a real woman you'll know who to ride with. I am a woman! You're nothing but a skinny little runt! And you talk too much! I'm sick and tired of you pushing me around! You ain't nothing but a cheat! Hey! Ow! Hold it. Hold it! [CLICKS] Had you all lined up. Oh. How long you been up there? Ever since you arrived. It was such a lovely picture. The cowboy watering his horses. They're mules. [CHUCKLES] I'm sorry. Of course, mules. Anyway, when you two started playing, well, I just had to get a picture of that. I'm sorry, my name's, uh, Dorothy Deerfield. Beaudray Demerille, ma'am. Well, I'm very glad to make your acquaintance, Beau. Perhaps you and your daughter would like to come and have supper with me. My camp's just over the side of those lovely trees. Sounds good to me, ma'am. Beau, don't you think we should be moving on? There's still plenty of daylight left! What's a good-looking woman like you doing out here in the wilds? I work for Lifemagazine. I'm doing a photo layout on the Grand Canyon. No fooling? "No fooling?" [BEAUDRAY LAUGHING] BEAUDRAY: Plus everybody in the company, uh, they had their own way of seeing it. I knew that it was either him or me. Beau, you're quite a cowboy. [BOTH LAUGHING] Well, you're quite a card, Dorothy. Mmm. Why don't you come over and sit next to me here before I get too lonely? Why, sir is that a proposal? Well, I'll let you know after you pour me another drink. Okay. [BOTH CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [WANDA CLEARING THROAT] Make that three. There's only two cups. I'll drink from the bottle. No, it's okay. You can have mine. I've had enough anyway. Well, come on, Beau, finish your story. Well, there's not a lot to tell. Well, of course, if you don't want to tell us. Yes, Beau, tell us your story. Drink up, honey. Like I was saying there we were, surrounded by a whole battalion of Krauts. Hey, you never told me you were in the war. Well, how could I with you talking 100 miles an hour? Anyway, we was running low on ammunition. I figured I was playing my last hand. What battle was this, Beau? Oh, it was, uh. Aw, hell, I was so busy fighting, Dorothy, I forgot to ask what battle it was. [LAUGHING] Was you scared? Scared? Shoot, I was terrified. My daddy died in the war. He won the Purple Heart. Your pop died in action? Oh, the way I heard it, he was the bravest man that ever lived. What's wrong? Nothing. My husband, Bill, was killed in Pearl Harbor. We'd only been married nine days. [SIGHING] Best time to get it. How can you be so cold-hearted? We both lost men we loved. Well, all I meant was if you're gonna get knocked off in the war, it's better to do it in the first day, rather than go through all the bull and get it at the end. Please, please, let's not talk about war or dying. It's all right. Yeah, why don't you take a walk and leave us women alone? Listen, you, I was doing just fine till you stuck your little neck in. Beau, I'd like to talk to Wanda alone just for a minute. Do you mind? "Why don't you take a walk and leave us women alone?" Shit. Well, I'm sorry about Beau opening his big mouth. He ain't so bad. It's just that he doesn't know how to make a woman feel womanly, you know what I mean? You really do love him, don't you? Yes. But we're cut from different cloth. I can't figure him out. When I was your age, I had my hair in pigtails and I was in bed by 10:00. You are quite a lady, Wanda. Do you really think so? Yes, I do. Demerille, as soon as you find that gold you're gonna get rid of that gal once and for all. Okay, hold it. That's great. Keep your chin up. Hold it. Just one more. Oops. Hold it. That's beautiful. I'll treasure this picture forever. If you're ridin', kick that mule! A woman's gotta be a fool to ride with that man. Reckon I'm a fool. Have a good journey. Bye. Goodbye. [CHIRRUPING] [BRAYING] Do you think we're heading in the right direction? Wouldn't be headin' in this direction if it weren't right. It sure is a pretty day out today, isn't it? It'd be a lot prettier if we found the gold. You're peeved at me 'cause you couldn't snuggle with Dorothy last night, huh? I don't wanna talk about it. I apologize if I ruined your evening last night, Beau. You what?Apologize! Girl, are you sick today?No. I know I ain't done you any good since we've been together, but I have a feeling that's gonna change. Wanda, look out! Heya! Get outta here! Come on, quick! Stay down! I saw an Indian push that boulder on us. It was the Apache Ghost. Ghosts! Let's go down by the river. It'll be a lot cooler. Oh, Beau, it's so beautiful. It's like a cathedral. I wanna give you this. But, Beau, this is your favorite. You ever shoot one of those things? Sure, lots of times. Oh, boy. I could learn. [GUNSHOT] I could sure go for a cold beer. See?I hit it. Oh. Throw. Hey. [CHUCKLES] Oh. Oh. Well. Beau, you ever been married? Yeah, a long time ago. Did you love her more than anything else in the whole world? Yeah, I sure did. Why'd you run off and leave her? It didn't happen like that. Anyway, it ain't none of your business. I didn't mean to pry. I mean, I don't know where you're from or what you've done. I found her in bed with my best friend. What? I was discharged late in '45, been overseas almost four years. Figured instead of calling, I'd surprise her. It weren't a pretty homecoming. What happened? Well, I strolled in around midnight. He shot me in the back and she stabbed me in the chest with an ice pick. I'd like to have bled to death from a broken heart. Now got to sleep. [OWL HOOTING] Beau, what's he doing? Looks like he's on his way to the Happy Hunting Ground. [CHANTING] Hey, do you know where Indian Head Canyon is? [WHISPERING] Shh, let's ride. Well, maybe he knows. Indian Head Canyon? See? Come on, let's ride. [CHANTING] Oh! Damn it to hell, we're lost! Does that, does that look like an Indian head to you? I knew we were close. Come on. Giddap! STRAP: You remember my second wife, Butchie? She had the hairiest legs in San Diego, but could she jitterbug! Yes, Strap, I remember Butchie. Well, I never said she was perfect. I can't get through there. What?But I can! Hey, get your little butt back here. I ain't turnin' back now. [BIRD SQUAWKING] What's wrong? Oh, nothing much. [RATTLING] Are you coming or going? Will you shut up? [RUSTLING] WANDA: What do you make of it? Well, that cross on the map must mean this graveyard. I mean, who killed them all? I don't know the answer to that. Well, my guess is the Apache Ghost. The only ghosts I've ever seen were in the Fun House at Coney Island. Tell that to Mr. Bitterstix. And what about the landslide? Do you want to turn back? Go ahead if you don't have the stomach to get rich. Well, well, well, what do we have here? It looks like some kind of religious hocus-pocus. Yeah. Hey, old man, you see a fellow and a gal pass by here? I'm talkin' to you, old man. You better say somethin', old man, or I'm gonna blow your ass off. Kill him. [GUNSHOT] [MULE BRAYING] Maybe this isn't the right Indian Head Canyon? It's gotta be! Well, I don't smell no gold. Well, if you'd get off your little butt and help, maybe we'd find it! I work just as hard as you do! That'll be the day! Beau! Beau, come here! Come on! Quick! What do you make of it? It's a rope ladder. It's a rotten rope ladder. [SIGHING] Go back to the bag and get the flashlight and the rope! Beaudray Demerille, this is it! Who's going down first? Who do you think? What if the rope were to break or something were to happen? I couldn't pull you up, but you could, me. Clip that flashlight in your belt. Is your gun loaded? Yeah. Beau, if anything happens to me... Nah, cut out that mush talk now. It may sound mushy, but it's from my heart. I gotta get you over the side. Come on! Not until I finish what I have to say. All right. All right. Spit it out. Beau, I love you, even though you are the biggest fool I ever met. Come on. Be careful of my 50 percent now. Be careful now. [SQUAWKING] [SCREAMING] Wanda? Wanda? I love you, too, Wanda. [GRUNTING] Gold! Gold! Gold! What are you lookin' so sad for? Wanda! I thought you were... What about the gold? Ah, yeah. The gold. Well, money's not everything, babe. Bust out, eh? Well, we tried. Everybody knows there ain't no gold in the Grand Canyon. [LAUGHING] Woman, we are rich! Rich! Those beans taste pretty good tonight. You just wait till I get a house with a real kitchen. I'll cook you the best grub you ever tasted! A house with a kitchen? I thought you wanted to see the world. Well, being an orphan, it kinda makes you want to have a place of your own. Of course, a tumbleweed like you wouldn't know anything about that. I run away from the St. Jerome Orphanage when I was nine. So I know all about that. You were an orphan? Wanda, I ain't sayin' I don't care for you. You put some meat on those bones, and you'll be a real looker. The men'll be fallin' all over themselves just askin' for your hand. It's you I want. Always have. Honey, I must be 20 years older than you. Don't you see? I might not be a woman yet, but I ain't never done anything to hurt you. How much money do you think this'll bring us? Well, uh, the first thing we do, my dear, is invest and double our money. Cattle, timber, land. Let's not forget Texas Curly's widow. Oh, yeah, sure. Emma Langston. But first, we invest. A man without property is a man without respect. Well, Strap, after all that hard work, we have finally struck it rich! Now ain't that the truth? Yeah. Hey, Rube. Yeah? I still get the girl. You bet. Well, if we ever run out of money, we can always come back. Not me. Why not? Ah, just a feelin'. Come on, let's get out of this place. Superstitious, huh? No. Let's just say I'm gettin' cautious in my old age. Get your gun out! Beau, the mules are gone!Yeah. They can't do this to us! Well, they're doin' it to us, whoever they are. The Apache Ghost! Help me get that gold to the cliff. What are you doing? If we want to get out of this canyon alive, whoever's watchin' us had better see that we don't have the gold. Come on, girl. But we were so close to being so rich. The gold ain't worth a hill of beans if you're dead, woman. Come on! It just ain't fair. Yeah. Who ever told you life was supposed to be fair? As I always say, easy come, easy go. Come on. RUBY: Hold it! All right, stick 'em up and hand over the gold. Everybody knows there ain't no gold in the Grand Canyon. Shut up, you little tramp. That ain't no way to talk to a woman, friend. Where's your mules? Run off. Ours run off, too. We thought you did it. The Apache Ghost did it. The Ghost? Say, little girl, it's time for you to grow up and I'm just the man for the job! Strap, your gun hand! Go for it, Wanda! [GROANS] Wow! Run! Christ, I'm hit! Ruby! Help! Ruby! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Pretty fancy shootin', Wanda. Do you think we hurt 'em? No, only their pride. But keep your eyes peeled. [COYOTE HOWLING] [HOWLING] That coyote's getting mighty close. Yeah. I thought we were bound for heaven last night. We ain't out of the frying pan yet, honey. Can't we rest?Hold it. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] A little breather, that's all I'm asking. You wanna end up buzzard's bait, girl? The gold! Beau, it's the gold! You see, Beau. It was meant for us to have. Yeah. Yeah! Get the packs! We can't be more than a couple of days away from the ferry crossing. What're you gonna do? Swim there? We could build a raft. Out of what? Sand and brush? Some gamblin' man you are. Well, there's a time to bluff and a time to fold. We've already played those cards. Well, I'm not givin' up. Well, you figure it out for yourself. [EXHALES] It's not for me, Lord. I just don't wanna see that little girl end up as buzzard bait. Care to take a boat ride in the Colorado River, Mr. Demerille? I always knew I was your good luck charm. Wanda, you're much more than that. [COYOTE HOWLING] [ROARING] [HOOTING] [GROANING] Beau! Beau. [GROANS] Babe, I ain't gonna make it. Bet you all my gold you will. Just my luck to be in the right place at the wrong time, babe, huh? It must've been the Apache Ghost. No, no. It weren't no ghost that killed me. You ain't gonna die. I love you truly, Wanda Nevada. [SOBBING] Oh. Beau, don't leave me. You're the only thing I've got in the whole world. I love you, Beau. NUN 1: It doesn't look good for the Orphanage when one of our girls runs away. STICKMAN: We're ready to leave. Would you send a boy up to, uh, 232, for the bags? You put a terrible strain on the other girls. Yes. Thank you. You mustn't say anything to those reporters downstairs. Yes, we'll take care of that. Yes, we will. [PHONES RINGING] This is the hottest thing to hit this area since Truman relieved MacArthur of his command. [CHUCKLES] Oh, hell, it's bigger. These hicks don't give a damn about politics. What're you gonna use for a headline, Hank? "Girl Returns from Canyon of the Dead." That ought to sell newspapers. [ALL LAUGHING] Wanda, we've gone just as far as we're gonna go with you. Now, you're going to the reformatory. Maybe they can teach you some manners. Are you listening to me? Gimme that! That's mine! Oh, Mr. Stickman, are you all right? Wanda! Wanda!Catch her! It's Wanda Nevada! NUN 1: You get back here! Wanda! Wanda! Wanda! Wanda! Wanda! Come here, Wanda! NUN 2: Wanda! [REPORTERS CLAMORING] Wanda! Come over here right now! Miss Nevada, we need a shot that'll make you look beautiful against the Canyon. REPORTER: Is it true that you found gold in the Grand Canyon? Believe what you want to. Oh, surely you don't expect us to believe it. Frankly, I don't give a damn what you believe. [GASPING] What? Can you tell us something about the man you were with? REPORTER: Yes, what was this man to you? Yes, could you tell us something about this Mr. Demerille? He was the man who saved my life. What? The man who saved your life? [CAR HONKING] Hi, babe. [GASPING] Beau! Wanda, Wanda, come back here! How do you spell "Demerille?" Where have you been? Well, I had to go invest our money, didn't I? Not too bad, huh? [ALL CLAMORING] REPORTER: Mr. Demerille. The box is for you, honey. REPORTER: Demerille, can we get... Ah, thanks, but don't you think we better be leaving now? Whatever you say, partner. Mr. Demerille, what about the gold? Ah, hell, everyone knows there ain't no gold in the Grand Canyon. [LAUGHING] REPORTER: But the story... Wanda, come back! Wanda, come back here. It's not too late for God to forgive you. Wanda! This is crazy!
