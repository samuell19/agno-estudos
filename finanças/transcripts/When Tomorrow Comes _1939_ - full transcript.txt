Helen says 8 o'clock tonight. Unity Hall. 8 o'clock tonight. Unity Hall. Gladys. 8 o'clock tonight. Unity Hall. What's the matter with you? Are you in a trance or something? You are in the wrong lane. Oh, honey. Sorry, Helen. There goes my whole week's salary. I haven't had a full pay-check since Christmas. That is all going to be changed tonight. But gee, what if they just say strike and leave us all out on a limb? They won't. Our demands are reasonable. Yeah? If I lose this job it will mean peddling chewing gum and lip pencils for me. I ain't a looker. Get going before somebody fires you now. You are in the wrong lane again. Oh. Strike, strike, strike. That's all I've been hearing the last week. No wonder I'm nervous. Maisie, bring me that stand will you? - What's the matter with Lulu? She was setting for dinner and she ran into me just now. I don't blame here, when I think of that meeting tonight. Gee, it's exciting. Where is Unity Hall? 3rd Avenue and 58th Street. Easy, easy. Walls have ears and great big ones in Karb restaurants. Did you see what happened to me just now? I'm so nervous I can't think. Girls, girls. Come on, keep moving. There is a customer at your station. Feed him and get him out of here. Space is money at lunch time. What would you like, sir? I would like some bouillabaisse. Huh? Bouillabaisse. You have it, haven't you? Well, I .. Just a minute please. For Pete's sake, Helen. What is bouillabaisse? It's a kind of a fish stew. We don't serve it. I am sorry, sir. We don't serve it. You don't serve what? Bouillabaisse .. whatever you said. - I see. Alright. We only serve what is on the menu. Well, I will take lunch No 4. Clam chowder, roast beef sandwich. No vegetables. American cheese. No pie. And coffee. I am sorry sir. We don't serve cheese with the lunch. But it says here .. apple pie with American cheese. Do you want the pie, sir? - No, no. I just want the cheese. We don't serve cheese. But you will bring the pie. Yes, I can bring the pie. Then supposing .. I just snatch the cheese and leave the pie? Yes, sir. Helen. That Frenchman has got me so rattled I don't know what he wants. Will you simmer down and forget about tonight? I'll take his order. Is there anything I can do for you, sir? Yes. Wait on this table. I'm sorry sir but this table is already assigned to another waitress. I came over to see what the trouble was. Trouble? There is no trouble. I just asked for some American cheese and I don't want pie. You don't want pie? - No pie. What else do you want? Clam chowder, roast beef sandwich. No vegetables and coffee. I'll get them right away, sir. One clam chowder. - One clam chowder. One clam chowder. One roast beef, no vegetables. - Ferdinand without flowers. Ferdinand. Hold the flowers. Helen, watch your step. He is a spy. Who is a spy? - The guy that wants the cheese. Gladys here knows him. Tell her, Gladys. Well, he looks like that Frenchman that used to come to the 42nd Street branch. We used to call him Johnny Big Ears. And did he make trouble. - What kind of trouble? Snitching on us and snooping around. He even got two of the girls canned for making dates with the customers. He doesn't look like a spy. He's a foreigner, ain't he? To me, all foreigners are spies until I learn different. One clam chowder. I'll soon find out. Pour the soup down his neck, Helen. I beg your pardon but Mr Karb is on the phone. Who? Mr Karb, the man who runs this restaurant. Oh. Please, must I speak to the manager because I want some American cheese? Maybe he wants to talk about something else. But I don't know him. Are you sure? - Positive. What name did he ask for? Pardon? I said, what name did this Mr Karb ask for? Now you have got me. - I beg your pardon. He was French. But how did you know it was me? Well, you are the only Frenchman in the room. How did you know I was French? Fifty million waitresses can't be wrong. Well, where is the phone? - Please, no .. There is no phone. Please sit down. Mr Karb isn't on the phone. - What is this? I'm awful sorry. We thought you were a company spy. A spy? Me? We've had some labor trouble lately and it's made some of the girls suspicious. Do I look like a spy? Do I act like a spy? No. I am awfully sorry. If you'll excuse me I will get the rest of your order. Girls, girls. Break it up. What's the matter with you today? Come on, get going. Here is your roast beef. Once clam chowder. - One clam chowder. You know in these troubled days, it is a serious matter to be taken for a spy. I know. I am sorry. In my country a spy is taken out immediately and shot. That would be terrible. - Yes, it would wouldn't it. And in Germany .. - We would both be shot. I see that you realize the seriousness of the offence. Well it wasn't really me. It was some of the other girls. Why didn't you? I've been around this business long enough to know a gentleman if I see one. Thank you. And what is your idea of a gentleman? Any man who doesn't immediately ask a girl what she does with her evenings. Lulu. One coffee, Joe. - One coffee. He's no spy. He is just lonely. Helen. There is man here to see you about the hall. Oh, thanks. Here is the rest of your order. Look. Give this to Prince Charming with my compliments. And remember, the customer is always right. Where is he, Bill? Out there. Don't you girls back down tonight. We've got a surprise for you. That sounds exciting, Tommy. - Just you wait and see. Hello, Helen. - Hello, Jim. They said it was a man about the hall for tonight. You don't think they'd let me in Karb's kitchen if I was organising the strike? You're pretty smart aren't you. - Can you get away? Yes. Give me one minute to change my dress. I'm sorry Prince Charming that I thought you were a heel. That's perfectly alright. What did you call me? - A heel. No, no. The other. Prince Charming. Have I made another mistake? Helen called you that. - She did? Where is she? She is out seeing a man about hiring Unity Hall. Are you girls giving a dance? No, we're having a meeting tonight. A secret meeting. And will Miss Helen be there? Sure, we'll all be there. - Oh. A meeting at Unity Hall, huh? The manager knows I'm going out. - Fine. Is everything all set for tonight? - Yep. How about the girls? They are all keyed up. Hold that for me, will you. I think they will go through with it if they have to. I hope so. I've never handled waitresses before. If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be handling them now. I know. I appreciate it. You think we'll have to go on strike? - I'm afraid so. Unless Karb says more this afternoon when I see him than he has so far. Alright, girls. Let's see the color of our cards. This is a closed meeting. Show your cards. Mary! Where have you been keeping yourself? Good evening. - Welcome. What are you doing here? You cannot tell a man he is a spy and just go away and forget him. But How did you find out .. - What you did with your evenings? That was nothing. I found out enough about you to write a biography. Just what did you find out? Well, in the first place. I found out that you lived at 452 East .. 52nd Street. That you are an orphan. That you came from Niagara, New York. That you weigh 116 pounds in your stockinged feet. You've been talking to Lulu. No, just listening. Hurry girls, the meeting is about to begin. It's been nice seeing you. Can't I get a ticket and go in with you? The only way you'll get a ticket to this show is to get a job and join the union. And I've a faint suspicion your interest in me wouldn't go as far as that. Well, as matter of fact I already belong to a union. CIO or AFOL? I beg your pardon? - That's just what I thought. You don't even know what a union is. How much you want to be that I get in? I'll bet you the plugged quarter I got for a tip today. Goodbye. - Au revoir. [ Singing: ] "Solidarity forever." "Solidarity forever." "For the union makes us strong." Girls. Members of Local 153. There is only one story we want to hear tonight. The chair will entertain a motion .. To dispense with all regular business including the reading of the minutes. I make such a motion, Sister Chairman. I second the motion. All those in favor, say "Aye". Aye. The busboys, they are with us. Bless their little hearts. We are the Karb busboys. We've come to stand by you girls. Win, lose or draw. Find seats everyone. Looking for a seat? - Yes. Here is one. - Thank you. What branch do you work in? Me? Wall Street. And now. The man who has done more than anyone to build this union. The man we are all waiting to hear. Brother Holden. Well, girls. And boys. We have seen Mr Karb. Your committee and I. We presented your demands. As reasonably and as fairly as we knew how. Mr Karb listened politely. He showed us every courtesy. And we've brought you back exactly nothing. Nothing. Not one single word of hope. Nothing. Mr Karb will not compromise. You can take it or leave it. That is Karb's answer to you. Work or quit. We won't work and we won't quit. We'll strike! Yeah, we'll show them. No. We won't strike. How can we strike? What chance have we got? A bunch of girls against a strong outfit like Karb. We ain't a bunch of girls. We're a union standing together. And maybe getting licked together too. - We'll strike! Karb's is as good any place. Maybe better. Yeah? I suppose you are just tickled every time you get fined for broken dishes. What about the lay-offs when it's slack? And the customer being always right no matter how fresh he has been with you. I say we strike. Just a moment. Just a moment, please. I know how you feel. Nobody likes strikes. They mean hardships and hunger. Suffering and trouble. Only sometimes. Men and women workers feel crushed and helpless. When that time comes they have to fight hard. They have to strike. Are you married? No. Then you have no children or grandchildren. No, I haven't. Well I have. Grandchildren. And I have to work to support them because their .. Father was killed in a strike. Don't let them railroad you into this without thinking it over. I tell you we can't strike. My mother is sick. I need medicine for her. A doctor. I cannot afford to lose my job. Neither can I. I need every penny to take care of my baby. Be quiet. Hush up! Hush up, girls. Let's listen to Helen. Well. I don't know what right I have to speak. Perhaps none. Because in a way I'm more fortunate than the rest of you. I have no family to support. I am alone in the world and I can get along on my earnings as a waitress. I can put a few pennies aside each week so someday I might be something else. But I have worked with you girls. And I have seen the worry and fear on your faces. I've seen you tremble at the thought of losing your jobs. I've seen your struggle to make one penny do for two. The way you scrimp and save yet never have an extra dollar for a new hat. Or a pair of stockings. Any one of a million things a girl might want. We've all heard these speeches tonight. Some of you have children. Some of you have parents. Aged and sick depending on you. And it is not for me or Mr Holden or anybody to tell you what to do. I would rather cut off my right arm than be responsible for a decision. That would bring you more suffering or more hardship. But we want the right to stand on our own feet. To enjoy life. To feel like free human beings. And you can't just go on hoping for those things. That's what Mr Holden means when he says you have got to fight. He knows nobody will hand you those things on a silver plate. You have got to go in there and make them listen. And if the only way to do that is strike, then I say strike! All in favor of strike. Say aye! Aye!! "Solidarity forever." "Solidarity forever." "Solidarity forever." "For the union makes us strong." That was a grand speech, Helen. - Thanks. I must go to headquarters. Where will you be if I want to contact you later? I'll be home. Is there anything wrong? No. Except we are going to try to pull the girls out tonight. You were superb. I've never heard anything like it. Thanks. - You were marvellous. Simply marvellous. Thanks again. - You were wonderful. Now, careful. I'm beginning to think I was good. No, please. I may be expressing myself badly but .. No, you express yourself beautifully. No, but I mean. I've never met a woman before who could make speeches. Call strikes. Serve pancakes. And look beautiful all tat the same time. Are you kidding me? - No, I assure you I am not. Helen. Hello. - Good evening. Gee, it's hot. Where were you going? Oh. Say .. How would you like a little drive in the park? I think that would be lovely. - Good. Come on. Taxi! You may. - Thank you. Take this lady for a little drive in the park. Now, what would you like to do? Go someplace and dance? It's too warm. - A little bite of supper? No thanks. - Well, shall we walk? Say, who are you? - Oh, I am sorry. Philippe Andre Pierre Chagal. Well. Fairly oozing with names aren't you. Well, I was such a wonderful baby that everyone wanted to hang his name on me. Oh. That still doesn't explain how you got in that meeting tonight. I have told you. I have a union card. See? Oh, a piano player? - Uhuh. Where are you playing? - I'm not playing anywhere right now. Oh. No job? - No job. Where have you been playing? - Oh, here and there. Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago. But nothing steady, huh? - Nothing steady. Oh, that is too bad. I never would have take you for a union man. No? Well until tonight I disliked unions intensely. What did you join one for? Well, if I hadn't I would have had to move my own piano. That's the trouble with the world today. Everybody wants to do the playing and nobody wants to move the piano. Gangway! What is the idea of pushing me into the can? What is the matter? Did you hurt yourself? I tripped on my pants. You tripped on your pants? Well, they are kind of long aren't they. That's a fine looking car you've got you know. Yeah the car is okay but the engine sure is crummy. Can't you hold them up with that rope a little better? Hold them up with one hand. Like that. See. Then push with the other. You will beat every car on the street. Next time I'm going to use my sister. She ain't got no pants. A perfect symbol of today. - How so? Capitalism taking a ride and labor pushing with his pants falling down. How can such ideas come out of such a pretty head? When you're born on my side of the fence you get those ideas for nothing. What is this? Pier 27. East River. On a hot night like tonight it's the one place you can get a breath of fresh air. It reminds me of Venice. That's Brooklyn on the other side. I like it. A little crowded maybe, but what is down there? Just a landing pier. Aren't you afraid you will fall off? What have I got to lose? He is right. Did you catch anything, sonny? Are you trying to catch a fish? No, the other shoe. Why did you follow me tonight? - Huh? Why did you happen to pick on me? I didn't pick on you. - Yes, you did. As soon as you saw me you asked me to wait on your table. But that was because .. Whatsername, Lulu, couldn't give me what I wanted. Oh? And besides, I wanted to hear you sing. Did she tell you that too? - Yes, she said you had a lovely voice. And that when you first came to New York you wanted to do something about it. I'll smother her when I get home. - No, no. Please don't. What would I do for information about you? Who knows. If you are patient I might tell you a few things myself sometime. And that's the trouble. The time is very short. 72 hours, exactly. Are you going away? Yes. I have got to go back to France. Say, lady. Come on in, the water is fine. I haven't got a bathing suit. That's nothing. Neither have I. Tell me, have you always wanted to sing? Why did you give it up? I found I had to eat. Let's don't talk about that now. It seems so long ago and .. I've gotten used to what I am doing. - No. You never have and you never will. I could tell by your speech tonight that you are a girl who must always go ahead. You must never give up. Say, look here. You can't just wander into my life and start telling me what to do. I've been getting along alright. Here comes the cop! Come out of there before I come down and get you with my club. Hey lady. You'd better come back here. Nobody is allowed under the dock. Let's go away. Why don't we hide? What are we hiding from? We haven't done anything wrong. Come on, I know you are down there. I can hear you breathing. Oh, shut up. We'd better get out of here before we get into trouble. Good evening, officer. - Hello. Here we are. Well. Goodnight. And goodbye. - Oh, not goodbye? We have just met. Hello, Helen. - Hello. Well, I just heard the Karb girls are out on strike. Yes, they are. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. What were you saying? - I said, not goodbye. You are going away aren't you? - Just for three days. Look, tomorrow is Sunday. Can't we spend it together? I beg your pardon. Can you direct me to the Lexington Avenue trolley? Yes That is two blocks down and three blocks over. Thank you. - Not at all. Well, I have been told there are seven million people in this city. And tonight I have met them all. Can't we go somewhere tomorrow so we can be alone? I'm afraid not. The strike and everything. I am sure they can spare you for one day. And I have so little time. - Good evening, Helen. How did the meeting go? - Fine, Mr Brown. That's good. A warm night. Say you will come tomorrow. No, don't shake your head. I will be here at ten o'clock in the morning. Goodnight. I wonder what happened to Helen. It's getting late. She'll be along in a minute. Hello. Where have you been? I was getting worried. I just went for a little walk. It's so hot. You were swell at the meeting tonight. - I didn't do anything. Oh yes you did. When I saw you get up there and heard you I was .. Oh, hello. Alright, alright. I'm going to bed. Before I have to take another ride in the park. Helen. I want to thank you for the way you pulled those girls together for me. I told you I couldn't handle women. I only hope I did the right thing. - Of course you did. We'll win this fight hands down. Say, where did you ever learn to speak like that? I didn't. I just believed in what I was saying and .. The words sort of came out. We could go a long way together you and I. You'll go a long way, Jim. I've always known that. - So will you. You're not the sort of girl to stand still. You'll get ahead, you can't help it. Why do you look at me like that? It's funny. Somebody else said the same thing. What are you doing tomorrow night? Huh? I said, what are you doing tomorrow night? I don't know. I haven't made up my mind yet. What about having dinner with me? I'll drop in around eight. Alright. - Well .. I guess I'll be going. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Jim. Helen. Wake up. If I'm dreaming just let me sleep. You like it? I never want to go back. Let's head for the open sea. Just think of it. A picnic lunch from the Ritz. On a yacht on Long Island sound. Only this is not a yacht. Just a sloop. A sloop? The big brother to a catboat. - Oh. Don't call it anything so uninspiring. It is wonderful. Alright. It is a slice of the moon. Nothing can be commonplace where you are. I like you saying that. I hope you mean it. Don't you think I do? Helen, look at me. Hold the tiller a minute will you. Hold it steady. - What's the matter? There is a squall coming. What do you do in a squall? I am going to try to beat this one. Helen. The cushions. Pull the tiller on your left. Slowly. All the way? - We are going about. Can you make her fast? Do you need any help? No sir. Not for a little blow like this. Look at the black clouds over there. You ever see anything so black? We had better go before we get soaked. Look at it come down. May I have your things? Thank you. Frightened? No. I like storms. - Yes? They look more pleasant through a window. Look at that surf. Is this yours? - Yes. And the boat and the car? - Uhuh. Bonsoir, Monsieur. - Bonsoir, Nicholas. Would you like to fix up a bit? Yes. I would. Show the lady to the guest room would you. Wait a minute. I will have a beautiful fire ready for you. That will be nice. If there is anything you wish, just ring. Thank you. Thank you, Nicholas. We will have dinner here in front of the fire. Right, sir, At what time would you like me to serve it? Around seven. - Right, sir. Please don't stop. I was trying to make more noise than the storm. You know this, don't you? Sing it. "My song to thee." "In the silence of the moon." "My dear has come to me." "Waiting for a soft whisper." "Beneath the starry sky." "Beneath the starry sky." "Never dream that it can harm thee." "As long as I am near." "Dearest come to me." "All day long I adore thee." "Dearest, come to me." "Dearest, come .." "To me." "Oh come .." "To .." "Me .." I never dreamed you had such a lovely voice. Thank you. I never dreamed you were a great pianist. You with your union card. I thought you were just an ordinary piano player out of a job. But I told you my name. How was I to know you were the great Andre Chagal? Who would ever expect to find you dining in Karb's on a blue-plate special. Heaven bless Mr Karb who was placed on earth so that we two could meet. To Mr Karb. - Hmm. To Mr Karb. May his conscience bother him until he gives us what we want. Ohoh. - I'm being punished. Why didn't you tell me who you really are? Would it have made any difference? It might have. - That's what I was afraid of. Are you angry? No. Just wondering what I am doing here. Having dinner. Spending the evening. Do you mind? No. It's a lovely room. It's so secure and full of lovely things. Everything a person could want. - Everything? You exaggerate, I hope. Maybe a little. But it must be very nice to be surrounded by pleasant things. Space to breathe in. Time to look around you. Music. Boats. Brandy. [ Telephone ] Excuse me. Hello? Yes. Yes. What? Coastguard station? I cannot hear you. Hello? I wonder what has happened. Hello? Nicholas. The wires must be down. Hello. Nicholas. Monsieur. The lights are out. Yes. Yes, I can see that. Bring some candles will you. No? No, never mind. The fire light is enough. We don't need to see the far corners of the room do we. I'd better be getting back to town. By the looks of the storm it is now or never. Let's make it never. You'd better make it now. But the storm. I'm not afraid of storms. Let me. My hat and coat, Nicholas. - Hat and coat. Thank you. Monsieur Philippe. No dinner? - No dinner, Nicholas. You had better put this on. - I'm alright. Shall I get the car, Monsieur Philippe? No, never mind. I will get it myself. Thank you. See, I can't even hold an umbrella. Wait here. Please, don't get out. Well, I saved my hat. You had better put this around you. Although I have no sympathy for a girl .. Who prefers wet feet and pneumonia .. To me and my fireside. Thank you. - Not at all. [ Telephone ] Hello? Oui. Coastguard Station? Oui. A hurricane? Hurricane not here. Hurricane? It's coming down in buckets. Can you see alright? - Yes. What's that? It's a car. It's turned over. There is nobody in it. - Thank heavens. It is getting darker. - Hmm. Listen to that wind. No chance of our tipping over is there? - No. You had better take the upper road. The main highway has been washed out. [ Coastguard announce: ] "Warning. Warning." "Hurricane." "Seek high ground." "Water rising rapidly." "Warning. Warning." "Seek high ground. Water rising rapidly." What was that voice? The coastguard airplane. Warning people to get away from the ocean. I feel guilty dragging you out into this. Maybe you have saved our lives. How? My house may be in the middle of the ocean by now. Look out! You're swell. We had a close call didn't we. Right. Let me see just what happened. The Coastguard will never get us to New York. You stay here. I will see what I can find. Let me come. - Stay here. Same thing. You will be quite safe here. I was never so glad to see anybody in my life. Did you think I was lost? - Yes. There is some kind of building up there. I think we had better make for it. Now wait a minute. You had better put this around you. I can't hear what the coastguard was saying. I opened the door and I couldn't get it closed again. It's a church. Yes it is. Are you alright? I think so. We will stay here until the storm is over. I wonder if there is anybody around. I don't know. I will go and see. I will only be a minute. Don't you think two can see better than one? Yes. It seems to be deserted. I wonder what is in here. There should be some candles somewhere. Will you hold this please? Thank you. Do you suppose it is alright for us to barge in like this? Barge? What does that mean? It means breaking in without asking. - Oh well .. I suppose it's alright on a night like this. Here we are. I don't think anybody will mind our using a few candles. There. That's better. Nice comforting things, candles. They always remind me of Christmas in the holidays when I was a child. Your hand is trembling. You are frightened? Not now. - No. We are quite safe here. After all, the storm is not going to last forever. I read about one in the bible that lasted 40 days and 40 nights. [ Breaking glass ] What was that? Probably some window. Blown open. Hold this. I will see what it is. There it is. I thought I should .. At least say thank you. Yes, we should be grateful. Look. There is an organ loft up there. I think it will be much warmer. Don't you think? - Yes. When I was a boy I used to sing in a choir. Until they found out what was wrong with it. I bet you looked angelic. The old boy, a master, had a wooden leg. And when he beat time with it. You would have thought that the whole balcony was coming down. I think it is. And now we will try to make you comfortable. Take off your wet coat. Warm now? - Uhuh. Feel safe? Yes. Hungry? - Hmm. You don't happen to have a nice steak in your pocket, do you? I am afraid not. A piece of apple pie maybe? I still don't like apple pie. I'd settle for a nice hot cup of coffee, wouldn't you? I'll settle for being here with you. You can still say that? After all we've been through? Shall I read to you? I'd much rather you played for me. If the motor is not working you will have to do the pumping for me. It seems to have a slight cold. If it's been up here very long I'm not surprised. You know. You are pretty swell. Me? Why? I saw that water rising downstairs. I know what you are trying to do. Philip. Yes? Supposing this is the end of the world. What gives you an idea like that? I don't know. The storm maybe. Church. Your music. Maybe I had better stop playing then? - No. Please don't. You know when I was a child at the orphanage .. I always used to try to and imagine what it would be like. The end of the world. But I never expected to die in an organ loft with a famous pianist. How did you imagine it? I don't know. I sort of saw myself in a beautiful long chiffon robe standing on top of a hill. And people dying like flies all around me. But I never seemed to die. I just stood there. Waiting for the clouds to open. And a chariot to come down and whisk me away. So, if it is this way ..? No. This is much better. Helen. There is something I must tell you. Not now. We have such little time together. Let's be happy while we can. But when morning comes .. - When morning comes. We must say goodbye anyway. You see. I happen to have fallen in love with you. I realized it at the house. That's why I left. But it seems. We are going to be given a little added time. Before we go back into those separate worlds from which we came. So don't spoil it by reality. Let me dream just a little while longer. Very well. Go to sleep. I'll tell you in the morning. Somehow I wish morning would never come. Look at that. I suppose we should waken them. Shall I poke them with something? No, no Henderson. Ahem. Ahem. I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. Good morning. Good morning. I am the reverend Mr Morris. This is Mr Henderson, my organist. We have come to see what the storm has done to our little church. Well, I hope you .. I hope you don't mind our taking shelter. You see, my car broke down. We didn't know where to go. - The rain was so hard we couldn't see. Well, you were fortunate to have found the church and to have stayed here. Did the storm to a lot of damage? The entire countryside is flooded. Do you live in this neighborhood? - New York. We can get you back to the emergency headquarters. From there I believe you'll be able to get transportation back to the city. That would be very kind of you. - I think we'd better start right away. For, although the church was saved .. It is flooded. And it may not be entirely safe. How are we going to get out? We have a boat downstairs. Revered, in my excitement yesterday I forgot my lunch. To think this good food was here all night. Are you hungry? I'm so hungry I could eat anything that wouldn't bite me first. There is chicken. And cheese. Thank you. And some people say that music is the food of love. But personally I always have to have three square meals a day. Mr Henderson, please hurry. Coming. Will you have something else? No, thank you. - Thank you. You had better get dressed. Either my feel have swollen or my shoes have shrunk. What time is it? Ten to seven. Why? I suddenly remembered this is Monday morning. I am supposed to be picketing Karb's restaurant at noon. What will happen if you are not there? They'll probably line me up and shoot me as a traitor to the cause. Well, maybe I had better not take you back then? What about you? You are sailing. Or had you forgotten about that? No. I haven't forgotten. What time does your boat sail? About .. midnight. At the wharf. Helen. I have fallen desperately in love with you. And I don't know what we are going to do about it. Please hurry. Coming. Philip. The reverend is getting very impatient. We slept through all this. For the use of the church. - Thank you. Do you think it will be safe there? Of course. I wonder if they could get my hat. - Yes, sir. This way, lady. It is perfectly safe. Mr Henderson will show you the way. You've been very kind, sir. I don't know what we'd have done without your boat. To say nothing of your church. I hope you will visit our little church in dry weather too. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thank you. If you come with me I will show you the way. There is a soup kitchen up there if you would like some hot coffee. In the lowlands the houses were completely washed away. Look at that over there. That was the Brown house. They say that the baby was lost. Could we get some coffee please? Well. Now that you are set I will be getting along. You will find the buses over there. - Thanks again for everything. I hope you won't let this visit discourage you. This is the rottenest summer we've had in some time. Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. Here you are. Thanks. This bus leaving for New York. Free transportation right into the city. Alright. Right this way for New York. This bus going to New York. Look, if we hurry we can make that bus. - Alright. Thank you very much. - Thank you. Monsieur. Monsieur Chagal. Well. What are you doing here? Oh Monsieur, you are safe. I looked for you all night. I found your car and thought something dreadful happened. No. We are alright. What about you? Nothing ever happens to me, Monsieur. But .. [ French language ] Oh. When did they come? About half an hour ago. I tried to telephone last night at your apartment. That's alright. I will come right away. - Very good, Monsieur. Helen. Will you excuse me a moment? Your wife? Yes. I tried to tell you last night. - I know. I wouldn't let you. It's alright. Will you come and meet her? No. You run along. She is probably worried. Wait here will you. I will be right back. Where are they? - Right this way, Monsieur. This bus going to New York. Free transportation. Come on, two of you. Alright. Bring in that other bus. Come on with it. What's the trouble? The road is out about a half mile ahead. Any chance of getting through? It looks like we're in for a good long wait. If you people want to get out and stretch you will have plenty of time. Excuse me. I wonder if there is a telephone around here. You might try one of those stores but I doubt if there is a line through. Thank you. Helen. Excuse me a minute, would you. Why did you run away? It seemed the only thing to do. I'm not very good at scenes. Don't you think you at least owe me a chance to explain? What is there to explain? I took a trip to the country. I had a marvellous exciting time. Now it is over .. that's all. No it isn't and you know it. Philip. - Yes? They say we have a much better chance of getting there if we take the north road. Alright. We'll try. Oh, Betty. This is Miss Lawrence. The young lady who was stranded with me in the church. How do you do. - This is Mrs Dumont. How do you do. - Can't we give you a lift? I don't think so, thank you. - Please, come. There's no telling how long you may be stranded here. It's kind of you but the buses are .. - Please come along. This is my wife. Madeleine. This is Miss Lawrence. How do you do. You sit in the back. Do you live in New York, Miss Lawrence? - Yes. I see the cars are moving. You must have had a dreadful experience during the storm. I was scared to death. Were you? Oh .. I love storms. I like the thunder and lightning. But they won't let me have them. They say they are bad for me. Madeleine. But .. That is because we don't like you to excite yourself, dear. Madeleine hasn't been very well lately. You shouldn't have come all the way down here, dear. You've put such a strain on yourself. That is what I told her but she insisted upon coming. But I am alright now, mother. Really I am. It's just when they tell me I can't do things that I feel badly. That last nurse we had was such a fool. She thought she could stop me from doing things. She even fed me things I didn't like as if I were a child. I am not a child. I had a child once. Didn't I have a child? Yes, dear. They didn't want me to come down here to look for Philip. But I got out on a window ledge. And I didn't come back. Then they let me. They thought I'd fall. But I wasn't afraid. Oh dear. You look tired, dear. Lie back and be quiet. Thank you so much for the lift. - Not at all. You must come to see us sometime when Madeline is feeling better. Goodbye. - Goodbye. I will only be a minute. I'm sorry it had to happen this way. I must see you again. You'd better not. Goodbye, Philip. Where on earth have you been? - Hello, Lulu. What's the matter? You look as if you spent the night in a mousetrap. Yeah. What time is it? - Half past eleven. I suppose you know we are to picket at twelve? Sure. That's why I came home. Say, where did you go with that Frenchman? We took a little trip out on Long Island. Long Island? You must have been in that hurricane. - That's right. Well, blow me down. That sounds just like him. He couldn't help it if there was a hurricane. Helen honey, maybe it is none of my business. But I'm telling you don't ever trust a musician. I had a boyfriend once who played the sax and I know. Any new developments in the strike? Nothing much. Holden chewed the fat all day yesterday with Karb's lawyers. But they didn't seem to get anywhere. So far it is a deadlock. How do you know? Holden was around here last night. He wanted to take you to dinner. How is he? Well, he has still got his health. Hey, you sound as if you've been away for twenty years like Rip Van Winkle. That's how I feel. Have you fallen for that piano player? Please don't ask questions. Don't you think you had better lie down and rest? I don't want to rest, mother. I want to do something exciting. When I rest I dream. - Oh, Mrs Chagal. You don't help me. You just watch me. Madeleine. She knows best. Go and lie down like a good girl. Why does everyone try to make me do what I don't want to do? Where is that girl? What girl, dear? That nice girl in the car. She has gone home dear. Oh. Will she be back? Sometime, maybe. Why? - I liked her. Yes. I liked her very much. I think I will go and take a rest. That's right, dear. I am so worried about her. What was that she said in the car about getting out on a window ledge? She didn't really. That is just another one of her fantasies. She seems far worse today. She is so helpless. I hope the voyage and Paris will make a difference. She'll be alright. I'll give her something to make her sleep. Philip. You've been marvellously patient with Madeleine. And as her mother I want to thank you for us both. Alright, girls. You can throw away the signs. - Says who? They just called. Agreement reached. The strike is settled. Who won? - You did. Report for work in the morning. Don't forget, girls. If Helen hadn't given us that pep talk we might have backed down. [ Singing: ] "Solidarity forever." "Solidarity forever." Helen. I had to see you again. I couldn't possibly leave things as they were. I wish we could. I wish we could leave them the way they were before we met. Helen. Don't be bitter. I'm not bitter. I just feel sort of .. Numb in here. Helen. I have done you a great injustice. In allowing you to get involved in my life. I'm not blaming you, Philip. It's no more your fault than mine. I should have had the courage to tell you last night when I started. I wasn't very much help to you, was I. I didn't want to hear anything that was unpleasant. How long has she been this way? About five years. A baby came. It was born dead. She never got over it. Dreadful. When I asked you into the car I had no idea she would be taken that way. I mean, it would come to you as such a shock. She is quite alright for long periods of time. Then suddenly, a cloud comes over her mind again and she becomes like a child. Isn't there any hope for her ever getting better? I'm afraid not. Fortunately the doctors say that she is not unhappy. She lives in a world of her own. And you? I have my work. My music. Now I have you. Philip. I cannot give you up. I am glad you came, sir. What is it? Madeleine has locked herself in her room and won't come out. How long has she been in there? - Since you left. She talked to us at first. - Then she put on the radio full blast. Madeleine. Madeleine. Isn't there a passkey to this door? - Yes. I was afraid to use it. She threatened to jump out of the window if we did. Oh, Philip. I am so frightened. Madeleine. Betty. Pull yourself together, dear. Look. She has changed her dress. She must have got out somewhere. But how? Where could she have gone? Hello. Are you surprised to see me? Yes. I thought .. Is anybody with you? No. No. Philip would be furious if he knew I had come. Why did you come? Because Philip is in love with you. How do you know that? Did he tell you? No. He didn't have to tell me. I knew it. You see, I am not always as mad as .. people think I am. Cigarette? No thanks. I'll get you a light. You know, they think smoking is bad for me. But I like to smoke. So I do it every night after they have gone to bed. Don't call anyone on that telephone. If you do, I'll tell the whole world about you and Philip. There has been nothing between Philip and myself. That's funny. Don't you believe me? Yes, I believe you. That is why it's so funny. Because there isn't going to be anything between you and Philip. Ever. From now on. You sound very vindictive. Hasn't he always been kind to you? Yes, that is just it. I don't know what I would do without him. And I know I can't share him with anyone. You see. When my mind is clear as it is now. I always know that the darkness will come down on me again. And when it does it's only the thought of Philip that gives me courage. You don't need anything like that. There are plenty of men for you. But I have to hang on to the one I have. Do you understand? You don't need to threaten me. Of course I don't. But I have put one weapon in your hands. If Philip ever knew I'd come here to talk to you like this he would hate me. And you can tell him, you know. Nothing I can do could stop you. But you won't will you. It is unfair to ask that of me. Yes. But I am asking it. You won't. Will you? No. Yes, I knew you wouldn't. Why? Because I am helpless. And you are not. That's a funny victory. You win because .. You are helpless. I don't think we should wait any longer, Betty. We should notify the police. The publicity, Philip. - We can't worry about that now. Hello? Get me police headquarters please. Yes. [ Buzzer ] Hello mother. Where have you been? - Out. Out is a big place. - I've just been for a little walk. Helen. It's for you. Well, did he ask you to go to the end of the world? He wants to see me tomorrow. Are you going to? I don't know. What time is it? You mustn't miss your boat. - No. I still have a few more minutes. What about your bags? They have already gone down in the car with Madeleine. Don't you want to wear your flowers? It seems a shame to stick pins in them. I just want to save them. It is a lovely dress you are wearing. I'm glad you like it. I've been saving up for a couple of years. I didn't know what for until .. You asked me to dine with you tonight. You shouldn't have done that. You must have had plans. You must have had other things you were saving for. Plans have a way of changing sometimes. More wine, madam? - Thank you. Thank you, You know .. This wine comes from the vineyards near my home. I wish you knew my little village. I am sure you would like it. As I do. Helen. I want to ask you something. Will you come to Paris with me? If I came to Paris. I would be living in the shadows of your life. I couldn't do that, Philip. Not even for you. I would come to hate myself in time. I might even wish that she .. I know. Forget what I said. You have done so much for me. I have been able to offer you .. So little. I don't want anything, Philip. See. I ordered candles on the table. Because you said .. They reminded you of birthdays and .. Holidays and .. Happy things. Philip. You have been so .. Now, now. People are looking at you. They are saying .. Who is that beautiful woman? They mustn't say: why is she crying? Must they? My eyes always go red when l cry. That would go with my flowers, wouldn't it. Hmm? Alright. What did he say? The cab is waiting. It is time to go. Will you .. will you come down to the boat with me? No. I'd rather you just got up and left as if you were coming back again. As if you had just been called away for a minute. Very well. I'll be back. In a little while. I'll be waiting. -(s-d-)-
