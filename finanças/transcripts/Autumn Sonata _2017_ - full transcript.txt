I was born and raised in this town. I've never left this place. I liked the poplar trees in this area. I loved my father who was like my friend. I enjoyed little joon following me. I thus believed I would live in this town all my life. Tam soo, the 37th generation of the lim clan. Tam almost 30, and works for a post office. Good morning. Hello. Many of these in this bus are distant relatives of mine. The kid is always late. Can you do something about it? Something? Stop! Stop! Running so hard. Poor kid. Stop the bus now. You gave him a lesson. Please. I told you to get up 10 minutes earlier. What a fine morning exercise. The early bird catches the worm. Old habits die hard. What is he up to? Is that joon? Stop it. Stop avoiding me. You're hopeless. He is crazy. Look what he's wearing. I want to see you. Ok, ok. I'll call you later, Hi, grandaunt. Stop calling me that. What else can I call you? You are my grandaunt you're so professional at your work. Say it louder the true professional of our time. Flattery is mighty, isn't it? It is. Kids have no interest in the trees. That's why you should take care of them. Me? The poplar trees are infected with bacteria. You know damn well how fatal it can be. The town hall is taking good care of them. Can I not ask help from you, my next of kin? Well... Have you heard about "the town guardian'? We should launch one here. Then, we can take care of the trees, too. What a nonsense. "The town guardian' what a lovely idea. You're a genius just like your father your father and I had mother-child... I mean, father-child bonding. You are the righteous man of our time. I am? I'm afraid?? You're sitting on the the postmaster's seat. It makes me feel embarrassed. You know what? You're too lazy to grow the orchids. Good day, sir anywhere but here, without kith or kin. I'm 29 years and 339 days old. Astor flowers greet me. How are you? It's Autumn. Cockscomb flowers will bloom here, and lilies there. Qver there will be cosmos. How do you know? Listen to your heart. Can you hear the flower seeds singing? Not at all. No? You're my flower, Joon, Mr. bong wants to see you. Not today. I'll visit him tomorrow. I'm done today. Ms. duggi went to visit her son. What a foul smell. Do you moonlight these days? No way. I am exhausted every day. You can't fool me. Even my mother wants you to visit her, I'll be there tomorrow. Get off. Shall we make electricity with this? How? Now turn the pedal. Harder. Harder, I say. Well, let's do it together Why so cold to me? You promised. I told you. I wasn't serious. Don't be silly, dear. Stop calling me 'dear'. Ah, yes. Don't be silly, honey. You're impossible. I'm your aunt. Hey, we are distant cousins. But, I'm still your aunt. Forget it. I am leaving this town with you. Dream on. Dream? Sorry. Does the hand still hurt? Ok. I'm going. But I haven't changed my mind. When I turn 26, I will go abroad and live with you. Bye. I've saved almost 50 grand. I sure have. See you. Hello. It must be Autumn there. Yeah. Are you doing ok? Yeah. Soo, let's have father's memorial service here in Toronto this year. Dad wouldn't fly that long to Toronto for that. For god's sake, it's only a ritual. He's just a dead. Only a ritual? Forget it. I'll take care of the service. I am the oldest son. Come here for the service. You're so stubborn. Am I stubborn? Jesus. What are you doing? He's your brother. You shouldn't have. I shouldn't have? Not at all. He's also filial, only with words. Don't say that. Tasty, isn't it? Sure you can do this? Absolutely. Good. Bow to the deceased. Yes. This is not a daily work. I'll call you when I have work for you. This is a fine job with substantial income. Now you give it a try. Me? Grab it tight. Good. Good. Please take a good care of cremation. Wow, it's so heavy. We have a lot today. Hurry up. It's a piece of cake. Hello. I want 35,000 won. Ma'am, a debit card will make it easier. Shall I make one for you? No, thanks. All right. Pin number, please. Omen what? Your pin number. 0o-m-e-n oh, man? , the movie. The horror movie? ah, 666... From. I'm 29 years and 315 days old. Lily scent fills the house I'm 29 years and 203 days old. Trumpet creepers glance at me Joon, what are you up to? Who's that? My nephew. I made up my mind. Marrying you is the goal of my life. Well, what then? We'll travel around the world. If you don't change your mind for 10 years, t'll marry you. Go now. So cute. I'll be 26 in 10 years. Keep your words. You're flattered. There. - Hello! - Hi. What's wrong with you? Why are you so absent-minded? We have tons of work, but you enjoy your peace here. Why don't you be my postmaster, and I'll be your staff. Sorry. When I was your age, I had neither truck nor motorcycle. No, nothing. Even a bicycle was so rare. Every postman walked. I walked every corner of this town with heavy bag on my shoulder, you know how important the poplar tree is. It's the eldest being in this town. Yes. You mentioned "the town guardian". Yes. Can you organize it for our town? We should take care of the tree, and learn from it. People nowadays lead such a busy life. We live every day by the hour, even by the minute. But trees live the time of nature. It lives in two time zones, day and night. Sir do you remember what you and my dad used to make? Your father and I made a whole lot of things. The thing with a drum can why do you ask? Just because. Preparing a most beautiful end. Yesterday I went out to the field with soo. I knew it was my last winter. Watching trees with her, I felt time stopped ticking. Should I tell her of this disease or not? It's a blessing in a way to know when to die. Otherwise, I couldn't have appreciated each day this much. I document the days I have lived, and realize I've had quite a decent time. Documenting my past gives me a big consolation. Every day I write. This is all I can do. Father taught me how quickly blooming flowers fade away, how fast colored leaves turn dry, how poplars lose leaves in the late Autumn and gets ready for the coming winter, how such many beautiful things disappear as the cold wind blows. What are you writing in the corner? You left work early today? I don't feel like working. What? Thanks for picking me up. What's happening? Why do you need the drum clock? Just because. Just because? You sound exactly like your father what do you mean? He kept on saying 'just because'. And 'what's in a hurry?' Quite often. Tke care. Thanks a lot. You know what? What? Someone broke into my house. Holy cow! A thief? This isn't the first time. He knows you live in the house alone. It must be someone from the town. A bastard. Call 911 right away. Can we scare him away instead? Scare him away? A thief, a thief. Where the hell are you? Come on out. There. Stop there! You bastard! Can we stop? It's joon, isn't it? Yes, let's stop now. All right, all right. He's crazy. Let's go back. Oh, my god! Kids like you must learn about how great our family is. The great great grandfather, Mr. woong-hyun, he was the prime minister of the country. His son was the governor of southwestern region. And his son, in-ho, was the famous general of the civilian troops. You are his aunt, aren't you! You tell me how close they are in the family tree. You seem to disrespect your own family. Look at this family tree. Your great great grandfather used to be her great great grandfather's brother this means they lived together joon, how dare you fancy your own aunt, and break into her house? You disrespectful rascal. S00. Yes? A young woman like you should have been more careful. You shouldn't have given him a wrong impression that you were interested in him. The world is getting crazier every year yes. Stop such a nonsense, for god's sake. Your old-fashioned idea on family drives kids away from this town. Let's go. How dare. How old is he now? Isn't he old enough to be dead by now? Hi. What are you doing here? I'd like to send a parcel. You work for a delivery service. I getit. Please make it pay on delivery. I told you never come near soo again. I'm her for a mail. Mind your own business, will you? What? How dare. Would you please leave me alone. You rascal. How dare you. Hello. Yes, sir. It's tomorrow at yun-jung restaurant. Thanks a lot. Oh please. You should come. Everyone else is coming... Grand aunt, what are you writing? Nothing much. It's more difficult than I thought. Love letters? I'm documenting the memories of my father. Memories of your father? Your father was a man of determination. Fantastic! You are the fanciest female smoker I ever know. Flattery is... Mighty. Yes, it is. Hurry up with smoking. Why? Afraid of the elders? Such a chicken. I'm not afraid of the elders at all. Hello, sir. Good to see you. Joon is soo's everlasting energizer. Good. Feels good. A black cat. It's wearing a tuxedo. I'd like a country with many cats. I'd like a traditional wedding of the country. Three two one. Bool! You scared me. Let's live here, only you and me. Sunflower boy: Why are you mad at me? I promised joon too much. The promises enriched my life. But they are now impossible to keep. It breaks my heart. Should I tell him or not? I just can't make a decision. Passport 26th birthday a memorial ceremony during the day? Very wrong. As the mourner likes it. The world is going crazy. Sir I et me bow to the deceased. - You? - Yes. I'd like to bow to her father Get up now. Sir, it's me, joon. You know it for sure that I've loved soo all my life. You know it so well that I am the one who can make her happy. She promised she would leave the town with me. But she can't do it because you are resting in this town. Please allow her to leave with me. What are you talking about? Accept my bow, sir this is to thank you for your approval of soo and me. Why do you bear with his blatant audacity? Take him out of the house. Right away! Get up. Let's go. Come on. Please admit that you like me, too. Say something. Go away! S00. What did I tell you? S00. Go. Please! Let me smoke a cigarette. For the past 10 years, I've been crazy about money. I cleaned the cattle pens. I even worked at the crematorium. Only for leaving the town with her But you ancestors wouldn't allow that. Why the hell? Fuck! You wanted it. Are you satisfied? Of course, she is. But what about the sunflower boy? Father was an inventor. He was a man of curiosity. He was a dreamer. No tears writing about him I am the spitting image of my father he and I share many things from such a petty habit as snoring even to untimely death. Tomorrow I turn 26. For the past 10 years, I've worked hard for tomorrow. I'm leaving tomorrow. Even without you. Say something. Joon. Go now. You and I are strangers from now on. My dear, the stamp isn't strong enough. Joon has finally left. He has left me for good. Now that he's gone, my journey is ready. I cast a spell on myself. Be brave, be strong. Bool! What brought you here? A bicycle. I mean, why are you here? To live with you. I can help you with anything. Perhaps you came for this? A heater? It's a clock. Clock? How does it tell time? It tells the time of nature. Will you define 'the time of nature'? The time of nature divides a day only by day and night. It definitely slows time. As simple as that. He had magician's hands. With his hands, any waste turned into something glittering and useful. He knew his end was quite near, but he was not like any ordinary man. He made peace with his fate. Sunflower boy S00, are you awake? You finally did it. The drum clock works. Is it patented? This cloth will take good care of the tree for the winter. Trees also feel good when they are taken care of. Where are they gone? Who? Those leaves that covered the poplar trees. They will come back next spring. How soon is spring coming? Winter isn't here yet. Spring makes the world wonderful. All four seasons make the world beautiful. The tree will stay green even after I die. Don't say that in front of an old man. When I die, I'd like to have a woodland burial. A woodland burial? Isn't it cool to be buried under the poplar tree? With that burial, I won't be afraid of death. Because I live on with the tree. What's wrong with you? Sick or something? Just fine. You stopped working for the post office? The postmaster wants you back. I don't know. There are things to do before I turn 30. Can you do them 'after' you turn 30? Isn't this something. Did you make it? Is it patented? Not yet. Daddy. Father told me. Life is the borrowed landscape. We can own nothing in the world. Those words still echo in my ears. Whenever wind blows, his words still echo in my ears. Life is the borrowed landscape. Mr. poplar tree, this drink is for you. Cheers. You and I have a drink today. How old are you, Mr. tree? 150 or 200? Swell. I'm 30. Only 30 years old. Perhaps you remember me. When I was this little, you gave me a playground for me and my dad. When I went to work, you always greeted me. Please let me ask you one last favor. Let me sleep beside you. I feel so secured thanks to you, Mr. tree. But what about my joon, the dumb fool? He's only 26. He has so many days to live. Allow me to cry for once. Not for me living my last days but for him preparing for our future. Poor joon. Dad, those flowers and trees must be freezing. They are warm under the snow blanket. Why are flowers beautiful? Cause they are flowers. Cause they vanish just the moment they bloom. As the snow melts away with the sun? Yeah. Wind is blowing in the air such a gentle wind. Hello? Yes, yes. But I'm now out of the town. All right, I'll do it one more time. Joon? Is that you? Sir? Tke this. She had the same disease as his father's. Tree of soo lim born... 1986. 09. 16 deceased... 2015. 11. 23 No tears writing about him joon is soo's everlasting energizer!! I turn 30 in a couple days. He is already 26. He has waited for 10 years to be 26. I was happy with him for those years. I 'w as'? I already talk about it in past tense. It's painful to imagine his sad eyes reading this book. I hope he now understands me why I had to push him away. Farewell to myself of 30 years. Around the world with soo and joon farewell to joon of 26 years. I'd like a traditional wedding of the country. Joon and soo got married.
