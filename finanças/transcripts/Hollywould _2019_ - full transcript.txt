I don't have a ticket. The conductor appears as she walks down the isle. On her face there's a wicked smile. Her teeth are sharp and her breath is vile. And when she speaks, she speaks in style. There's no way off why don't you sit down. I'm sorry she lied. I'm really just a clown. She senses my worry She senses my fear. She whispers softly in my ear. Do not worry, do not doubt at any time I will let you out! Take back control of your mind. Your will. Your emotions. Your soul. Mark don't let him separate us. Don't! You have the power to control it Mark! That guys really rude! Really what guy? Stop it you're scaring me what are you talking about? Give me the money in the register. I will kill myself.

Baby, Baby I am so sorry. Don't do this. I am so sorry. No, Mark, no! I never wanted to be with you like this Mark, no! I'm suppose to be on a cruise ship with my wife sailing all around the world, but I'm here working with the great Mark Travis. Trying to save his life! Mark baby what are you doing, you can't let him separate us. He is the only thing that is getting in between us. Please! Baby don't! Don't let vienna take you out of here Mark. Don't do it. Don't do it! Baby I'm sorry! No! Clear. Oh God. Mark? Mark? Jannice? It's doctor Helen Boil. What? Mark your family is extremely worried about you. Monnica? Mark you stopped taking your medication and you're in an extremely bad place right now. Your father brought me here! Mark. Mark, thank God you're okay. Come on buddy. Lets get you out of here. No you're Davenport. I'm your father. It's me Edward, you're sick and we're here to help you buddy. Where's Monnica? Monnica's gone Mark. She died in a car accident years ago. You know that. You have to move on. You were cleared, son! I killed her. No, buddy. Vienna killed her. Vienna destroyed your writing career and now, and now it's trying to kill you. But I won't let it. Come on little buddy. Come here. Come here. Let me help you. I need Holly, where's Holly? Holly's not real! No she's real, she loves me! Let me handle this. You can't take her. Ever since the death of your wife... you developed a brain sickness called delusional disorder. You created this, this world. A police warrant has just been issued for Mark Travis. That can't be. That can't be. You're trying to escape Mark. No! Everything and everyone you're asking about, doesn't exist! Hey Mark, you alright? Who is he talking to, I know he ain't talking to us like that!? Okay. I promise we will get this done, listen! Sometimes the past catches up with us. Mark Travis. I didn't give it to you, but you can call me shade. Shut up, don't you lie to me I will do it! You're trying to escape Mark! I know you're upset baby! Get off me! I know you're upset! From the pain. From the guilt. This drug vienna, it helped to amplify the disorder. And it's back stronger and more toxic than ever before. I don't understand. I don't understand what you're saying. I'm saying that Holly is a powerful manifestation of vienna. Holly was always there for me, Holly was always there she never leave me. Holly wouldn't lie to me. Holly wouldn't lie. Hollywould. Oh Mark! The conductor comes to me in my darkest despair. Who she is, I am not aware. Ride my train, she says to me. Ride my train. The first trip's for free. She senses my worry. She senses my fear. She whispers softly in my ear. Do not worry. Do not doubt. At any time you want, I will let you out. You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain. I promise to take you away from your pain. She promised to take away all of my pain. She reaches out with her soft hands as she pulls me aboard. And when I'm on, she pulls the cord. I hear whistles blow. I see sparks fly. Soon enough, I am high. The conductor appears as she walks down the isle. On her face there's a wicked smile. Her teeth are sharp and her breath is vile. And when she speaks, she speaks in style. There's no way off. Why don't you sit down? I'm sorry, she lied. I'm really just a clown. This train is more powerful than the strongest of tide. Just relax, and enjoy the rest of the ride. Feeling stronger than God. Feeling faster than light. I've never experienced such incredible delight. I've become curious about my fate. I begin to wonder if it's too late. The tracks are running out. I begin to scream. I begin to shout. I want the conductor to let me out.
