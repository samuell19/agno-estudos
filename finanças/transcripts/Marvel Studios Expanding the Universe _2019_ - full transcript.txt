When do we start? [Tony] If you told me ten years ago that we weren't alone... I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, who knew? The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. Then again, that's the hero gig. Let's start over, shall we? [Tony] I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. [Odin] A wise king never seeks out war... but he must always be ready for it. [Steve] The price of freedom is high... and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only the one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not. -I don't even know who you are. -You will. [Hawley] I don't think you understand what you've started. They're dangerous. [Fury] They surely are. And the whole world knows it. Every world knows it. [crowd cheers] [Feige] The Infinity Saga is complete. Today I get to talk about Disney+. The opportunities that Disney+ is bringing to the MCU to grow it, to evolve it, to expand it, are tremendous. [cheering continues] The Falcon and the Winter Soldier coming to Disney+. Ladies and gentlemen... Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan. [crowd cheers, applauds] We're living our dream. We have the job that anyone else would kill to have. So, when we go to work, we have a really good time. [cheering continues] I'd like to explore the Falcon as a character. -[crowd cheers] -What kinda man is this man? -[crowd laughs] -We'll find out. We don't want it to be all action all the time. I'll do my best. [Spellman] We need to go home with these characters. We need to spend time really unearthing who they are. And since we've got great actors, put them in situations where they really get to show what they can do. We can create the same exciting, high-end, action sequences. But then in between those set pieces, we get to dive deeper into the character beats. [explosion] So, it's the best of both worlds. It is an unbelievable privilege to be able to continue to work with these two, year after year. And now, we do a much deeper dive on both of their pasts, both of their presents post-Endgame. I'll be seeing you very soon. [Feige] Daniel Br√ºhl is returning as Baron Zemo from Civil War. Sharon Carter is returning... Miss Emily VanCamp. [crowd cheering, applauding] It's gonna be an epic adventure, I think, and I'm so excited to be here. And a new character entering the MCU in this series is a character named, John Walker. And he's played by the great Wyatt Russell. -[cheering continues] -Ladies and gentlemen, the cast of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, coming to Disney+. [cheering continues] [Feige] WandaVision. Wait until you see this show. It's unlike anything we've done before. [cheering continues] Our writer, Jac Schaeffer, and our director, Matt Shakman. [Schaeffer] This is gonna be something, a series, that Marvel fans have never seen before. It is half classic sitcom and half full MCU spectacular. It's all right. [Livanos] So much of the fun in watching the show for fans will be the unexpected discovery of where and when in the MCU this series takes place, and how it all fits into that larger picture. [cheering continues] [Feige] It is extremely cool, in large part, because Lizzie Olsen and Paul Bettany are starring in it. [crowd cheering, applauding] Two of the most iconic Avengers, Wanda Maximoff and the Vision. We're gonna have a lot of fun. It's gonna get weird. We're gonna go deep. We're gonna have lots of surprises. And we're gonna finally understand Wanda Maximoff as the Scarlet Witch. And yeah... [chuckles] It's so funny, and it just ends up being this huge epic-- It's the-- The writing's so extraordinary, and thank you very much. Joining the cast, reprising her role as Darcy Lewis, is Kat Dennings. [crowd cheers, applauds] Kat was in our first two Thor films, and it is remarkable to have you in this as well. [sighs] So good to see you. Aw. I missed you too. [Feige] Lieutenant Trouble... Akira Akbar played her wonderfully in Captain Marvel as a little girl. On WandaVision, as an adult, meet your new Monica Rambeau, Teyonah Parris. [crowd cheers, applauds] This is a dream. To be a Marvel superhero, and Monica Rambeau! Oh, my God. Reprising his role as Agent Jimmy Woo from Ant-Man and the Wasp, Randall Park. [crowd cheers, applauds] And it is my great honor to reveal the nosy neighbor of WandaVision, the amazing Kathryn Hahn. What world have I entered into? This is so awesome. [chuckles] [crowd cheers, applauds] Thank you for coming. The cast and the filmmakers of WandaVision. [Feige] Another unbelievably exciting thing we're getting able to do is do a live-action series with a character I think you know. [crowd cheering, applauding] Who's been one of the most popular characters in the MCU for years. Loki is coming to Disney+. What have I to fear? [Herron] We're taking Loki to an entirely new part of the MCU. We love this character as much as you guys do. And we just can't wait to spend six hours with him. [Broussard] There's a huge time travel component. There'll be a man-on-the-run quality to it. And we get the chance to explore more human sides of Loki. We're finally going to see him on his back foot. This is him being put in a position where he doesn't have all the answers and has been thrown a curveball by life. The show's gonna explore the questions we all have, like "Where did Loki go after he picked up the Tesseract in Endgame?" He goes to a number of places. I don't wanna spoil them. Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Hiddleston. [crowd cheering, applauding] This whole thing would not be happening without you. [crowd chanting] Loki! Loki! Loki! Loki! This is one of the most exciting creative opportunities, I think, I've ever come across. This is new territory. A new world. And I cannot wait to get started. [crowd cheering, applauding] Disney+ is allowing Marvel Studios to do, for the first time, our first animated series. What If...? [cheering continues] [The Watcher] Time. Space. Reality. It's more than a linear path. It's a prism... of endless possibility. [cheering continues] The 23 films of the MCU that you know, we're gonna showcase one little difference in each episode and see how things change. I'd love you to say hi to our head writer, Ashley Bradley and our director, Bryan Andrews. [crowd cheering, applauding] Incredibly cinematic, adventurous, exciting, funny. Basically, everything you get in the Marvel movies, but in animated form. We're gonna explore corners of the universe that might be untouched, which is really exciting. This has been one of the best, most creative, most fun projects I've ever had the honor to work on. Ladies and gentlemen, Peggy Carter herself, Hayley Atwell. [crowd cheering, applauding] For my episodes, Peggy Carter becomes Captain Carter. [metallic clink] [car horn] So, you follow her adventures if she had been the one that took the Super Serum. [Feige] It's been almost ten years you've been playing this character. You brought the whole thing to a close in the very end of Avengers: Endgame. And yet, the story continues. It feels like the gift that keeps on giving. But that's also partly 'cause of the fans. They love Peggy. They've brought her back. [cheering continues] [The Watcher] Some heroes will rise... others will fall. [growls] [cheering continues] You may have heard an awesome voice narrate that piece, The Watcher, played in this series by the amazing Jeffrey Wright. [crowd cheers, applauds] [Wright] The Watcher is a being, a non-earthly being, who observes all things. He's watching over the multiverse. We'll see where we take it. We can take it anywhere. [crowd cheering] [Feige] Hawkeye is coming to Disney+, starring Jeremy Renner. And introducing a new character into the MCU, Kate Bishop. [crowd cheers] [Tran] She's a new, young mentee that he can train to eventually take over the mantle as Hawkeye one day. [Feige] And we'll explore more of his time as Ronin in this series. Ladies and gentlemen, Hawkeye himself, Jeremy Renner. [cheering continues] [Renner] This is so amazing. What, um, I get to do in the show ultimately is shepherd an amazing character to be, [chuckling] ultimately, probably a better version of me. And the sentiment with that is, is what I think the fiber of what Hawkeye is. This is a superhero without superpowers. That means everyone's a superhero. [crowd cheering, applauding] And you might wanna hear about three new shows we're doing for Disney+. Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan. Muslim Pakistani teenager from Jersey City is coming to the MCU. [crowd cheering, applauding] It is remarkably exciting for us. You will meet her in her Disney+ series, and then you will see her in our films. Moon Knight, a new action-adventure series coming to Disney+. A very famous Marvel character for many years, Marc Spector. He was a mercenary. He was left for dead in the Egyptian desert, and he now may or may not be infused with powers from Khonshu, the Moon God. Or he might just be crazy. [crowd cheering, applauding] She-Hulk, coming to Disney+. Bruce Banner is no longer the only Hulk in the MCU. Jennifer Walters is a Hulk, she's a lawyer, and she's gonna star in a show unlike anything we've done before. This is what Disney+ is doing for the MCU. It is growing it. It is expanding it. Thank you, thank you so much. [crowd cheering, applauding] Oh, yeah. [Star-Lord] We're the Guardians of the Galaxy. [Rocket screams] Give 'em hell. This is the fight of our lives, and we're gonna win. Whatever it takes. -[shouts] -[shouts] [war cries]
