(flute playing) (birds flying away) Flute still playing Flute now playing with drums Ainbo - Spirit Of The Amazon (birds chirping in background) So, here's the plan I have set a trap. The most full-proof, amazing trap ever! Then, but just you watch I've told you before, I am the best hunter in all of Kandamou And, I'm only thirteen One day, people will all be saying, "Ainbo Of Kandamou" Greatest hunter in the whole Amazon! But, even the greatest hunter can need some little help That's where you come in You gonna help me catch him Got it? (giggles) Good (gasp) He's coming! I forgot bait! Hey! You stay here (screams) No! Help! Help! Huarinka - It gets worse every day More and more dead fish Our people are dying and many more are sick Including me. It's the curse But, you're going to get better Better or not. It's your turn, daughter I'm not ready to take your place Do you think I was ready to be a chief? At your age, all I could think about was girls And, well... girls It's true You are as ready as you will ever be But, Kandamou was different then Yes, I won't lie The forest was lush, the river ran crystal clear And everyone in the village was happy But, how can I end this curse? I don't know Maybe, we are all the curse Our heartlessness Da-aah! That's a bitter, sick man talking, not the real you You've everything he had at thirteen You are strong, brave and you have a good heart And you have a mission Save our village, Zumi Save Kandamou I have faith in you, Zumi And now, I need one amazing shot Steady... Ainbo - Atok! Atok - Haa! The mighty huntress If we don't hurry, we'll miss the ceremony We? I'm leaving now Then get me down, Zumi will be heartbroken if I'm not there True, she thinks of you like a sister But remember, you are not her sister You are not royalty You're not some great huntress You're just a girl hanging upside down in her own trap Cut me down Cut yourself down And never say Atok didn't try to help you Just a girl! I will show him For her to disappear, Now! Of all times Conibo - Zumi... Zumi - But... Conibo - Enough The Shaman - The time for talk is over You need to be strong, that's what the village needs now It's just, Ainbo is my best friend And I'm nervous Nervous? I am terrified, I am sure. Why wouldn't you be But, Ainbo knows this. She'll be here Okay, I believe you You know Ainbo has a nickname for you? What? The old hag? Mama Connie That's how she thinks of you Mama Ainbo's real mother would be so proud of you I wish she were here today too You are her mother now Villager - It's time Zumi - Yes Dillo - Pathetic Vaca - Preposterous Vaca And Dillo - PITIFUL! Huh? What? Hello Now, I'm seeing things I've been hanging upside down too long Ehn...Are we suppose to help her? Ehn...I think it's her I'll be the judge of that I know who I am, who are you? Smells like her Ugh...Don't try to sniff me! Oww! Hey, we're on your side No, you're not. You are a couple of mirages Vaca And Dillo - WE ARE YOUR SPIRIT GUIDES! My name is Dillo, I'm Vaca Sent to help you, help Zumi save Kandamou, ehn? No, you are not real Fine, insult us And you could hang upside down forever Alright. If you're real, get me down Nothing to it Grab your knife, it's that pointy thing If I could grab the knife, would I still be hanging here? Dillo - we could cut her down? Vaca - But, that's no fun I'm about to miss the biggest day of my life Hey! You're shouting You're right, I'm shouting at nothing Ainbo - You're not really here Dillo - Ah-Ah-Ah, don't start that again Alright, if you're real... Get. Me. Down! I suppose If you insist, I'll do it What do you think you are doing? Now, do you think we are real? I guess I have to Hehehe, I guess you do My spirit guides, wow... Wait! I'm giving this back Come on, let's go, we're already late Ainbo, I will never forgive you for this Hey! Spirit guides Vaca - Uhn! Give it to me, Dillo - Oh, no! Do you two mind, and remember, a spectacular entrance Spectacular is our middle name The royal necklace has grown heavy on my old shoulders But, now I can pass it on to someone who can bear it's weight And lead our village to a brighter future (villagers gubilating in background) Yea! Wooh! Yes! And so, I place this necklace around Zumi's neck Just as my father placed it around my neck, so many years ago Yes! Yea! Ainbo - Zumi! Zumi - Ainbo? I think you lost this Zumi, I brought you a gift It's not what I was planning, but this one's better Not just better, the best gift ever What is it? Ooh-Ohh-Ooh, maybe I should ride on top of you and wave to people, ehn? Hmm, how about I drag you in by your tail? You all know about our great jungle spirits And you all know about the terrible, awful, really horrible curse that forced them to disappear And the gift is? My gift is that I have brought the spirits back! What? What? Two of our sacred jungle spirits appeared to me They said, "Ainbo, take us to Zumi; Your wish is our command" (screams) Ahh! So, Zumi, Your Highness, meet your spirit guides! (villagers talking in background) Where are the spirits? What are they doing? Ehn, Zumi, meet your spirit guides! Hello oh? Spirit guides! Hey! You two, get out here! If Ainbo is calling spirit guides, they must have appeared to her She wouldn't make it up Ainbo, wait! Zumi, you can't run away, you have to stay with your people Dillo - Hey! There you are Vaca - Who? Turn around There you are, we've been looking for you You found me, and you better talk fast Ainbo - Or you're going to be sorry Dillo - Talk about what? You embarrassed me in front of the entire village! Oh! See, now we can explain that Then do it! Hmm, nope. We can't It might be bad for our health I thought you two were immortal, almighty Us? No one is immortal when it comes to "Yakuruna" Jungle demon? Do you know another Yakuruna?, ehn? No, and I never want to But, there is hope Hope?, from where? Hope to end Yakuruna's curse forever Vaca - See... there's this root Dillo - Deep in the jungle How deep? Uhn... About... Hehehe... We don't know But, this root will cure your village You mean end the curse? Vaca - Is that what we mean? Dillo - Yes, sure Do you at least know what the root looks like? Ehm, it's kind of... Hey, where are you going? Zumi was right. I'm a bad friend for not being with her Alright, we might not know where the root is, but we know someone who does Vaca - She can help you, Ainbo - Who? Dillo - Motelo Mama Vaca - The giant turtle Who carries the weight of the world on her shell I know who Motelo Mama is Are you saying she's real too? Okay, Hmm... I need to talk to Zumi You want to leave Kandamou? How can you abandon me, and at a time when I need you most? But I'm not abandoning you, I'm doing something to save the village Save your father Ainbo, if there is such a root Don't you think our shamans would have found it? They don't have spirit guides Aah... your spirits, again! Where are they, Ainbo? Why aren't they helping Kandamou? They are trying to This is their way, by helping me find the root Come with me and I'll show them to you I'm sorry, Ainbo. I forbid you to leave Kandamou Ainbo - But... Zumi - Forbid! Zumi just wants you to be safe, that's all Why won't Zumi believe me? Zumi doesn't see the world as you do You are a very special person I don't feel special There are important things you need to know, Ainbo I've raised you like you were my own child But it's time, you know the truth about Lizeni, your mother Come, that's all I ever wanted to know It was no coincidence I found you In her dream, your mother told me exactly where you'd be Under that tree, you loved so much I promised her I would look after you Ainbo - And you have Conibo - You two are very much alike She was the most beautiful and gifted hunter in all of Kandamou She could also see the spirit world What? I promised her that I would tell you her story, only if you were called by the spirits They've called me, but... they're kind of, well... loopy Not loopy, tricksters! Some guides work like this too Why? If they tell you everything and show you everything Then, what will you learn for yourself? I'll learn how to save the village? But, it's you who has to save the village, not them I still don't understand You need to sleep now Tomorrow morning, I will tell you more about your mother I love you, mama connie I love you too Zumi, wake up, wake up! Not now, Ainbo I'm asking for one favour, all you have to do is come talk to Connie Why? Woo-hoo, just listen to what you has to say She will tell you everything you need to know about me And my mother and the spirits (frustrating response) Ainbo! Please... Zumi, just listen to what Connie says And after that, if you still forbid me to leave, fine Zumi - Alright, Ainbo - Thank you, thank you, thank you Connie, I brought Zumi to hear the story of my mother Mom... (gasp) Connie? Connie, please don't leave me What happened? Get out This was no accident The curse killed her It's your fault! Ainbo - No, Atok - Yes! You and your spirits are the ones to blame That's crazy. You're crazy, my spirits are good You believe me, right Zumi? Ainbo! If she isn't guilty, why would she run away? Maybe, she's just afraid of you, I know I am I may frighten you, but I keep the evil spirits out of Kandamou I guess you were off duty lastnight I can stop the evil spirits from entering the village But, I can't stop the evil that has already been let in I don't know what you mean Yes, you do You know that, Ainbo was the last one to be with Connie They've shared that hut since Ainbo was a baby A baby born of evil Love must have blinded Connie on till now Atok - So, Ainbo is... Zumi - My father would have told me He would not have let Ainbo and I become best friends Huarinka was blind too That is why a child like you leads us today I might be a child but I'm not stupid And how dare you speak of my father that way? You have the power to bring health and happiness back to the village Atok - And make your father proud Zumi - How? Allow me to go after Ainbo and confront her evil Atok - Allow me to lift the curse Zumi - I won't let you do that Zumi, you are our leader now, whether you want to be or not Consider the fate of one, against the fate of all Let me lift the weight off your shoulders Zumi - My answer is no, Ainbo... Atok - Ainbo is the curse! Atok - I'm going to find her Zumi - I said... No How will you stop me? Do you think any of my warriors will do your bidding? Atok - One day soon, you'll thank me, Your Highness Zumi - Atok! Now, I've lost Connie and I'll never know about my mom Zumi thinks... I don't know what she thinks... Ouch! No, you don't Why are you so far away from the river, little turtle? But... You're trying to tell me something, aren't you? Ouch! You are a sign, right? A sign from Motelo Mama! Let's go find Motelo Mama. Thanks, little turtle It's me and the jungle now Spirit guides! Dillo! Vaca! Can you please appear again? Great, I have no idea how hard to call them, if I need their help Ooh, and I'm starving (gasp) Guava! I'm not greedy, we can share Here, you want some? You know it's not polite to stare, right? (screams) Let me go! I said I'll share with you! Grab on! Vaca - Not my nose! No! What happened? You two, were very brave Thank you for saving me I wish I... What's wrong? I wish I could tell Connie, but she... She's gone Gone? Do you mean...? Yes "Aye mama, farewell" Chat with us, Ainbo Let's make sure Connie's spirit travels to the next world safely Dillo And Vaca - "Aye mama, farewell" (crying) "Aye mama, farewell" Dillo And Vaca - "Aye mama, farewell" Where is Atok? Connie despised him, it's better that he's not here Now please, it's your job to send Connie into the spirit world Go Goodbye, Mama Connie I love you Please, watch down on me "Aye mama, farewell" "Aye mama, farewell" "Aye mama, farewell" Hahaha, I knew I'd find you What's wrong? It's Ainbo She'll come back No, She won't Atok is after her to... To... do what? Atok said Ainbo was the cause of the curse That Kandamou would return to prosperity, if he... He's gone after Ainbo I told him no, but he just ignored me My first command, and he treated me like...I'm some little child Zumi, listen to me Take two of our men and find Atok, before it's too late But Atok said, no warriors would join me Ridiculous! You are their leader now So now is the time to lead Bring Ainbo home She is a day ahead of us And if we don't pick up her trail, we don't even know which way to go We have to find her and fast Ready? Vaca - Wait, we forgot something Dillo - What? What did we forget? Yehehe...Breakfast See the fruits? Up there. shoot them Yummy, yummy. Get them down Where are my arrows? You lost your arrows? It's alright Here, try this This? Yep Concentrate... Aim and steady Dillo - Oops! (laughs with Vaca) No good Ainbo - Cause you gave me a reed instead of an arrow Reed, arrow. All the same Just watch Vaca - Bull's eye! Dillo - And a few more Whoosh... Zoom There's my breakfast Ladies and gentlemen, the best "palaijo" archer in all the Amazon Vaca - Dillo! Ainbo - Great, I am impressed But, you are a spirit You don't have to be a spirit to do that You just need to believe in yourself Here, I've got something that will help Show her! Shooting a reed into a tree Vaca - That was just a test Dillo - And you fumbled Got it! A gift from your spirit guides We made it ourselves You made this? How? When? Spirit guide secrets It's so beautiful I might never wanna shoot it Or you might Time will tell Instead, I'll keep it It will still be there, when you need it So, now I need to find Motelo Mama, get the root and save Kandamou Vaca - Exactly! Dillo - In that order Now, it's quest time! Actually, I don't know where to go. Can you help me? One moment What was the question? Can you help me? Vaca - Yes! Dillo - No! Vaca And Dillo - YES AND NO! Dillo - Sometimes, we can help Vaca - And sometimes, we can't Crazy, isn't it? How am I supposed to know when you can help? You aren't suppose to know Spirit guide secrets Again? Mhmm I told Connie that you're sort of... Well, sorry... I told her you were loopy But, she said if you helped me do everything, it wouldn't be my quest Vaca - Smart woman that Connie Dillo - I hope to meet her in the spirit world But right now, I am lost I have no idea, where the great river is Can you help me? Vaca - The answer is... Dillo - Yes! Climb on on, we'll cover much more ground this way Wow! The Amazon is amazing It's so much more than just Kandamou But Kandamou is part of the Amazon It is all one (grunts) Why did we stop? Are we there? What do you think it is? It's a place we stay away from Far away We think it belongs to the Yakuruna Then, why is it calling out to me? Ahh... What are you doing? Ainbo! We should go after her Sure, yes, we should you go first (gasp) It's the Yakuruna! (screams) What are you doing here? We never come here But sometimes, you gotta change your mind Why did they stop at the river? They are afraid of something Ainbo - Water? Vaca - Yeah, sure Next time, all we have to do is squirt them? You don't have to be mean Maybe, it's something that lives in the river Oh! Haa! Maybe Now what lives in the river? (gasp) Motelo Mama! Guys, do you think Motelo Mama is nearby? It's a big river Alright, I get it. It's my quest The moon's full, I'm going now Stay close to the river bank Dillo - We will see you later Ainbo - I hope so You gotta be more careful with your arrows I knew it was you Ainbo - When Zumi finds out that you... Atok - Zumi sent me to end the curse That's a lie She... She wouldn't I'm going to untie you now And I'm hoping you try to run away It seems like only yesterday when I went hunting with a young woman She was the fastest runner, best hunter And knew the jungle like no one else You are talking about my mother Lizeni You know about your mother? You'd be surprised by everything I know Not one more step, Atok Hahaha... Go ahead, shoot me! You don't think I will? I don't think you can I was so much in love with your mother, but she chose another Who was he? All that matters now is the curse And the curse ends here and now Are you the turtle that bit me? Hey, wait! Where are you going? Hey! Turtles! Motelo Mama! Motelo Mama! Please, it's Ainbo, I'm Lizeni's daughter Hello Ainbo I thought I'd never find you You look so much like your mother Everyone in the world seems to knows my mother except me Not true You know her better than anyone How? Tell me about your favorite tree You know about my tree? Oh! You'll know, you're Motelo Mama That's right, so tell me I found the tree when I was a little girl I felt like I could tell her all my secrets Things you would only tell your mother That's right, things I would only tell... But, it's a tree Just a tree? Everyone thought I was crazy for talking to a tree But, I think my mother's spirit lives in that tree And the root of your mother's tree is the root you are seeking What is it, Ainbo? I'm afraid, I'm afraid of the jungle, I'm afraid of the Yakuruna I'm afraid, I'm just a scared child who can't even shoot an arrow The jungle needs you, not me I am afraid too, Ainbo No! You're Motelo Mama For thousands of years, the bond between my children and I was perfect Then the Yakuruna infected all of my children They stopped believing in the spirits, in the jungle Now, I'm afraid that it may be too late There is no hope? You are the hope, Ainbo Ainbo - Huh? Motelo Mama - Yes You're a scared child but you're also much, much more I wish I could believe that You will Your mother's tree is sacred It's roots hold the power to change even the heartless heart So, they must be cut with a sacred blade made from moon rock Now, I have to go to the moon? (laughs) No, Ainbo Climb unto me You must go to the volcano of the moon. It's up ahead Find Pelejo the sloth Be careful how you speak to him, he's uhn... Grouch Bring him a gift something sweet Then what? One step at a time, Ainbo I believe you dropped this Who are you? I'm so tired Ta-da! (gasp) It's about time Do you always have to come out of nowhere? Dillo - If we came out of somewhere... Vaca - We'd already be there Forget I asked So, isn't Motelo Mama the most amazing, giant turtle... Who carries the world on her shoulder that you ever met? You know I met her? Vaca - We know everything Dillo - Except when we don't We know you have to bring Pelejo the sloth, something sweet So, here's your sweet leaf tree Perfect, thank you. I'll break out some branches branches? Oh-Oh-Oh... This is Pelejo, you're bribing What do you mean bribing? Vaca - He's got a bad temper Dillo - You've gotta get him on your side You don't want him to step on you Step on me? How big is this Pelejo? Uhn... He is about... Dillo - He is a giant Vaca - That's why you've gotta take him the whole tree Impossible No No? So, take the tree up to Pelejo Dillo - Get the sacred moon rock Vaca - Don't get stepped on And most important We'll... Wait right here Cheering you on every step of the way Are you crazy? I can't take the tree up there all by myself Didn't Motelo Mama command you to help me? Vaca - Yes Dillo - She did Vaca - But, we don't want to go up there Dillo - We're scared of heights Vaca - And uhm... Getting stepped on Ainbo - Stop whinning If I am going, you're going Or I am telling Motelo Mama that you are cowards Don't do that We'll go Okay, it is time for us to be brave Yeah, brave Vaca - Wait, stop! Ainbo - What now? I didn't know it was so steep Ainbo - Vaca! Vaca - We can't do this Oh yes, we can We just have to work really hard Dillo - Hey! Vaca And Ainbo - PULL! Hey! PULL! Hey! PULL! Hey! PULL! Vaca - Pull! That's it, I gotta rest Dillo - Hey! Ainbo - Pull! Come on, we are close to the keep No time to rest Vaca - Huh! Ainbo - Dillo! Hold on! This is the end of me Motelo Mama! Dillo! Vaca! No! Are we close to the top? Zumi - What happened? Village Warrior - I don't know Have you ever seen anything like this? It could be dangerous Of course, it could Now, follow me Atok - Zumi Zumi - Did you find Ainbo? I found her tracks She's still a day ahead of us But perhaps, she's not so important anymore She's important to me and you're never, never to disobey one of my commands again I understand Please, join us by the fire Zumi, I'd like you to meet the honorable, Mr. Cornelis DeWitt DeWitt - It's an honour to meet you Zumi - Likewise. I've never met uhn... DeWitt - A white man? What a beautiful necklace you have I'm going to explain what we are doing? Bring me the expert What brings you to the jungle, Mr. DeWitt? I'm a scientist ehn... Botanist What is that? I study rare plants to see which ones might make powerful medicines Zumi - You are a shaman? DeWitt - Yes, you could say that Look, this one treats malaria Zumi - Malaria? DeWitt - The disease, the blood suckers bring It has killed many of our elders Because you don't have the right medicine And this one is for yellow fever Untreated, that's almost fatal Mr. DeWitt says this could be the sickness that is killing Huarinka No, it's the curse that is killing my father But what if, these diseases are part of the curse? I'm not sure I understand You see Zumi, where I come from, we have perfected the cure for many diseases with our medicines They are truly miracles Zumi - And it could save my father? DeWitt - I believe so Then come to my village, to Kandamou Please, we have no time to lose I understand But, Mr. DeWitt, explain one thing You are a white man, a stranger to our jungle Why help us? What do you want? At heart, I'm a healer But if you want me to want something... Yes, go on Show me where you got the gold to make that beautiful necklace That's it? If you heal my father, I can show you where you'll dig gold out of the ground with bare hands Now come, back to Kandamou, light torches Forget your torches, I'll use this PULL! PULL! PULL! Is anyone thinking what I'm thinking? This volcano is stinky Ouch! I don't know much about volcanoes but why is the ground so warm here? Pelejo - Who are you? Let me have a closer look Uhn... I'm Ainbo of Kandamou Never heard of it or you Who are they? Who do you think they are? From up here, I guess they are very small sloths or very large ants (laughs) They are Vaca and Dillo, spirit guides Those two are spirit guides? Right, I know But what you don't know is that Motelo Mama sent them And me How do I know Motelo Mama sent you? How'd you know she didn't? She sent me to get a moon rock And if I come back without one... Well... I wouldn't want to be the one to blame Hmm... It's true that you don't want to be on Motelo Mama's bad side So, do you have a moon rock? Of course, tons of it Just at the top of the peak Take as much as you want There is no way I can get up there I need your help (laughs) I haven't helped anyone for a hundred years. Why should I start now? You are a very frustrating sloth, but I'll tell you why Ainbo - Look Pelejo - Look at what? Those two idiots? They are not idiots Not all the time look at the tree Is that what I think it is? A whole sweet leaf tree just for you For me? If I get my moon rock I cannot remember the last time I tasted anything sweet And afterall, Motelo Mama sent you Here, a moon rock Thank you Do you know how I carved it into a knife? You? (laughs) You can't I can. Give it to me Oh! That can't be good for your teeth Here (gasp) It's perfect Of course, it is Now, sweet leaves You're a hungry one, aren't you, big guy?

That man is dangerous That man saved my father's life He's not a man He's "Yakuruna" disguised as a man. I've seen it Vaca And Dillo - YAKURUNA! The village thinks that you are the curse. You know that, right? Atok said you sent him to find me to end the curse Zumi - That's a lie Ainbo - Did you send him after your best friend? I stopped him It doesn't matter now, That demon is all that matters Spirits! Demons! I am sick of it! If you continue to talk like this, I will banish you for good Where are you going?

Lizeni - The truth is everything Some of you remembered many years ago, I saved your life and brought you to the village Yakuruna - Stop it! Lizeni - Not everyone welcomed Will Some hated him It's true, I hated the stranger Because I thought Lizeni belonged to me But she fell in love with him I loved you, Will, and you were in love with me No more! I thought you weren't afraid of the truth Atok told everyone that Will had cursed me, put me under his spell My jealousy made me insane You Ainbo, you weren't even born but I already hated you too We were condemned for loving each other Love was our only crime I was saved by the forest spirit and became one with the jungle But the Yakuruna was waiting for Will He was perfect prey for the Yakuruna Lies!
