- Hi, Mom. - Hello. Shoot, Mom. Hi, Mom. Did you have a nice day? Can we have a carrot? Mrs. Nielsen, I must ask you to quiet down your kids a bit. - Other people live here, you know! - Where? - You are so bad. - We should be allowed to live here, too. - Aunt Gyda is coming to visit us for a few days. - Where will she sleep? - I don't know... - Bertram lives here then, too. Hi, Dad. Come and see. - Yes yes. What the heck, Bertram? It's... That's good. It is very good. - Who is that? - It's me. You don't say? I thought that, too, it definitly looks like you. And all the things you're carrying. - They're dogs, right? - It's five lions. Yes, they're lions. It is a very good painting, Bertram. - It's "Bertram and the Five Lions." - It's time to eat. Food is on the table. Tell me, is there anything wrong? - Have you been arguing? - Our mother doesn't like us anymore. - What nonsense. - Gyda is arriving tomorrow. Gyda? Now don't you start, too. It's enough that the kids are unwilling. Well, Bertha... I've invited Gyda because she needs to get away for a bit. She is your aunt, so you could show a little willingness to cooperate. All of you. It's not just that Gyda is coming... ...but I have also invited someone. Who, Henry? He's being released tomorrow, and he has nowhere to live. I don't know what to say. Gyda with her bad nerves, and now George. I didn't know you had invited Aunt Gyda. I felt pity for George. He is my brother, after all. And if we can help an aunt in distress we can also help an uncle, right? - Hey, baker. - Hello. - Got any bread? - Yes, of course. - Want something special? - No, it doesn't matter. - $2.50. Did you want butter too? - No. Just put it on Nielsen's tab, ok? - Hi, Bertram. - Hi, Uncle George. Be careful not to tramp on Oskar. Hello, old man. We'll make coffee and then surprise them, alright? - What's that thing? - What? - That thing hanging there. - It's dad's. Well, damn Dad's got a job. He's the guy who keeps an eye on the valuables and all the beautiful pictures. I've also made something. Bertram, damn it. Can't you see we're sleeping? - What are you doing? - Making coffee, but it's a secret. Well, Bertram. You've got talent. Can you see what it is? It's you and these are lions. "Bertram and the Five Lions." - Anders, Anders. - What is it? - Wake up, Uncle George is here. - Uncle George? - Hi, Uncle George. - Hello, uncle. Anders and Oskar. Uncle's best friends. I've missed you a lot. Aunt Gyda is also coming here to stay and relax. Gyda? Life is not the worst thing you have and in a little bit coffee is ready Good morning. Good morning, beautiful sister and dear, dear brother. - And thank you for putting me up. - Hi, George. - You're welcome. - You're all crazy, it's the middle of the night. Hi pricess, it's morning and the sun is high in the sky. You're full of energy, Uncle George. - We'll have a lot of fun. - We're going to the beach and swim. We'll visit you at the museum. So you can hang "Bertram and the Five Lions" up there. If you go into town, then can you fetch aunt Gyda? She arrives at 2:37. - Are you ill, George? - No, I'm just so happy... Rest your innocent eyes on this stronghold of art. A wonderful temple of paintings -... Where great masters like Van Gogh, Mozart and The Little Mermaid hang. Mozart was a composer. And The Little Mermaid sits damn well at Langelinie. Now, "Bertram and the Five Lions" will also hang in there. Excuse me, where would we find your colleague, Henry Nielsen? In the painting hall. Up the stairs and to the right. Come on, Bertram. There's dad. My painting. I've lost my painting. I found it! - Well, Gyda, is that you sitting here? - Yes, it's really me. - Winnie was supposed to pick you up. - Well, she didn't. - That's strange. - Yes, really. - You must have been sitting here for ages. - One hour and 47 minutes. Where did she go? The agreement was that Winnie would pick up aunt Gyda. Yes, that's true, but... Take it easy, Henry. It's true what Oscar says. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. Hi. - Had a good day? - Yeah... - What are you doing home too, Henry? - Has Winnie arrived home with Gyda? No. Gyda was sitting on the stairs waiting when I arrived. Go and say hello to Aunt Gyda. What happened? A painting was stolen while George and the kids were there. Gyda, my sunshine. My own little peasant rose. Old girl. Don't you recognize me? Yes, you're not one who's easily forgotton. Hi, aunt Gyda. - Hello. - Hello, Oskar. - Hello, Aunt Gyda. - Hello, Anders. - Hello. - Hello, Bertram. I can hardly recognize you. You've grown so much. - Yes, really. - And where is Winnie? It's really not like her to disappear without saying anything. No, no. I don't really like it. - What do we do? - I don't know. Go say hello to Gyda. There's surely a lot to do out in the sticks. All the little putt-hens. Putt, putt, putt... Yes, there really is. - Hello, Gyda. - Hello, Henry. Welcome to Copenhagen. Hello? Hello. Mother, Winnie wants to talk to you. I'll take care of the coffee. Yes, Winnie? Well, Winnie... Mom, listen carefully. The thieves have taken me hostage. Caravan. They've got the picture with Bertram and Five Lions -... ...instead of the painting with the three angels. Bellahoj. They will not let me go until they have received the right painting. Mercedes. They want you to meet with them tomorrow in The Great Park. Red. Remember it now. Goodbye. - Bertha, where are the side plates? - In the closet by the door. - Bertram? - Yes? Get your painting. - Shouldn't we call the cops? - Are you crazy, kid? - Yes, that's it. - They have stolen my fucking painting. - What should we do, Henry? - We do what they say. We give them the painting, so we can get Winnie home again. - But, Henry... - I don't want anything to happen to Winnie. - Has something happened to Winnie? - No, no, no... She be coming home tomorrow morning. She spoke so weird. What was that about a campsite? She spoke in code. She told us where she is. Of course. Great job, Winnie. Where is she, Anders? - How do I make coffee? - At Bellahoj campsite. - What about my painting? - You'll have to do without it. Uh, Henry. How much is such a dash of paint worth? $100,000.00, I believe. But you should definitly not think about that. $100,000.00 It's a damn lot of money. What are you rambling about? About the painting with the three angels -... which your father and mother will give away for nothing. - Nothing? Do you mean Winnie? - Absolutely not. I'm just philosophizing a bit about things. It would be just as easy as scratching one's head. - Thinking of something special? - There's special and then there's special... It's us who have the upper hand. We have the painting, they have Winnie. But we know where she is. - Now relax, uncle. - Well, well. Give him a break. - Do you have an idea, uncle? - Of course. If it otherwise might interest anyone. - I won't be in it anymore. - So leave it. Tell us, Uncle George. Okay, but don't argue. It's not nice to listen to. We simply go to the campsite early in the morning. Quietly. Whoever finds them, call with an owl cry. Whoo Whoo. Here is it... not. He is completely crazy. - There it is. - Whoo Whoo. It's here. - Great fun, isn't it, Oskar? - Shhh! It's right there. Oskar, you run across and find out where Winnie is. I would do it, but I'm too big. - Do it now. - Why can't Anders? He's smaller than me. It was you and George, who was in for it. - Come on, Oscar. - Relax, Uncle George. There he is. - Did you see anything? - There's one sleeping inside the caravan. - Who? - I could only see the feet. - Do you think they were Winnie's? - Maybe. - What color were the socks? - They were barefoot. - With a blue toenail? - How could you know that? She kicked the dresser, while trying to kick me. Beautiful, Bertram. You have a flair for detail. Really easy, Anders, right? I look forward to seeing Winnie's face. Winnie? Winnie? Hush, there's somebody coming. It's Uncle George. Hi, Uncle George. - What now, Oskar? - It's all crap. Uncle George. You must not swim here. Hello? It's Aunt Gyda. - Who is it, Gyda? - It's Winnie. She wants to talk to you. Yes, Winnie. It's mom. - What is she saying? - Yes. - Yes. - What's happening? Of course... that's clear. Yes. Winnie, take good care of yourself. - What did she say? - She said she was all right. At this time of the morning? Will she be home soon? Yes, I'm sure she will. - Won't she, Bertha? - Yes. I think we should go to Tivoli park tonight. I told Winnie that we'd meet her there. Sleep a bit more while we make morning coffee. There's no reason to alert dad and mum, ok. What they don't know about... Well, there is Bertha, and Henry too. We've just been on a short trip. Funny you should be right there. That was funny I just had to stand there. Well, I'm out again. Where have you been, George? We have been... Yes, where have we been? - We liberated Winnie. - But it didn't go quite as planned. I'll tell you something. And you, George. This is serious. It's not good for you to run around playing robbers and soldiers. This is serious for Winnie. The most foolish thing is to try and cheat these kind of people. And Winnie has called again. We're meeting them tonight in Tivoli. We must exchange the picture for Winnie in the Blue Wagon. - In the Blue Wagon? - Yes, that's how they want it. - It's probably best that's how it will be. - Who do they think we are? That simply doesn't matter, George. We go to the Blue Wagon and swap the painting -... - And behave like nothing has happened. - What about Gyda? Aunt Gyda only needs to know that we are meeting Winnie in Tivoli. Are we agreed on that? - Can we come too? - Yes, we're all going. And I think you should go to the beach today with Aunt Gyda. And no more tricks, George. Come with me we'll meet in the jungle... small Umba-monkey now on my back you must ride... small Umba-monkey what are you waiting for? - You owe me a dollar. - No. Sure you do. Gyda. Idiot. What the hell were you thinking? Are you crazy? He nearly drowned me. Aunt Gyda. Can you hear what I'm saying? If you buy me an ice cream, I will eat it. Alright, it's a deal. I'm going to take a nap. Wake me up in 20 minutes so I don't get burned? Huge Eskimo and a bag of french fries. - Hi, Winnie. - Hi, Bertram. Two astronauts. Let's go. Great. Great. By the way, I have a greeting for you from Winnie. Then you must give her our regards. - Winnie? - Yes, the girl who lives at home with us. - That's not true, is it Bertram? - Where is she? - What did she say? "Huge Eskimo and a bag of french fries." There she sails. - Winnie. - Winnie. - Come back. - Winnie. Winnie. Winnie. - What are we going to do, Uncle George? - She'll be home tonight, after all. If we liberate Winnie, the painting is ours. Faster! There lies one sleeping. Can you see the other one or Winnie? - No. - The other one is cooking. - What are they having to eat? - Can you see Winnie? - No. She's probably on the second floor. Hush. It's Winnie munching potato chips. - Hi, Winnie. - What do you want? We've come to liberate you. No liberation for me. I have an agreement with mum which shouldn't be broken. Come on. What are they doing? Bertram. Bertram. - Haven't they bound and tortured you? - Does it look like it? Come on, Winnie. Come on. You're crazy. - Now's our chance. - Give it up. I'm not going with you. Find something else to play. That's not fair, Winnie. We can't go back to Uncle George, without you. - I'm staying here. - What do we do now? Typically Winnie. What are you doing, Bertram? - It's great fun. - Don't you understand Danish? Hi, Uncle George. Bertram. Come on, Oscar. We're going. Say hi to mom and dad. And take Uncle George with you. Leave me alone! You fucked it up once again! That how it is when you're dealing with amateurs. We'd better hurry back and wake up aunt Gyda. So so. Just sit still. Ouch. - It helps, doesn't it? - Yeah. You look very pretty, Uncle. Stop, man. Stop now. Bertram. Why did you do something like that? Do something sensible. Take all the tape. - Is it ok? - Needs some tape. More. Oskar, Anders, Bertram. We gotta go now. - We're ready now, mother. - Two minutes, Bertha. We're ready to go, Gyda. - Do you think he'll see it? - Not as long as the tape works. - Let's go, boys. - Here we come. Here, let me take that. - We have to go now. - Yes, I'm really ready. I just have to... - Remember to lock the door, George. - Yes, of course. Two seconds, and I'll be there. I'll take it. Now, friends. Shall we drive? Four adults and three children. Thank you. Oh, George. Pierrot, Pierrot, come forth. Otherwise, we will never leave. Pierrot, Pierrot, come forth. Otherwise, we will never leave. Are we having a good time? We have it so good that we must have a high Tivoli Hooray. Yes. So, I'll count to three, and we'll all cheer together. - One, two, three. - Hooray! I forgot to say that it should be a high hurray. - We'll try it again. One, two, three. - Hooray! Let's do it again, and this time all the adults will join us, too. - One, two, three. - Hooray! We'd better go there now. Hey, I think you three should take a tour in the Balloon Swing. You can take Uncle George and aunt Gyda with you. I'd rather go in the Blue Car first. Yes, when you are in Tivoli, you need to ride in the Blue Wagon first. - Will Winnie have my painting? - Maybe. - Did they get the painting? - They must have. I don't have it anymore. - Mom. I saw Winnie in there. - Did you? - Hi, Winnie. - Hi, Winnie. - Hi, Winnie. - Hello to you. Hi, Aunt Gyda. - Is that my painting? - Yes, Bertram. Here you go. Winnie, sweetheart. Are you okay? Thank God. I'm very confused. I entered with George and came out with Winnie. What kind of trick is he playing now, Henry? I don't know, but we'd better get away. Come, Gyda. Let's go for a walk in the garden. - What about George? - We'll wait for him. - We'll find you again. - Dad, will you look after my painting? There's Uncle George. - Look, there's George walking with the children. - There's aunt Gyda. - Hello. - Hello, Aunt Gyda. - Should we join them? - No, let them enjoy themselves. - We can't keep running. - Let's figure something out? Of course, let your uncle think of something. Come on. Is this dangerous? Not at all. It just tickles a bit in the stomach. There is a wonderful view. You can see all the way to Sweden. There is George and the children. Bertram, you stay here. Anders, stay here. You stay here, Oskar. Winnie. - Yes? You stay here. Look, there's George and Bertram. Off you go. There is Winnie and George. There is Oskar and Winnie. Isn't it nice, Gyda? Look, there's Bertram and Anders. Why aren't they coming back? I'm wore out waiting. There they are. Here you are, Uncle George. At least $100,000.00 Damn nice. Henry, Bertha, I got it. Well done, George. Thank you. The museum will be very pleased. Yes, George, we'll split the reward. I'll carry that. Gyda. Goodbye, George. I've had a good time. Come on, George. - Goodbye, Gyda. - Goodbye, my friend. Bye, Anders. Goodbye, Winnie. Farewell, Bertram. For you, because you've been so sweet. Then you can have my painting. - Here. - Thank you, sweetheart. Farewell, Bertram. I'll hang it above the couch. Goodbye, George. Goodbye. Thank you for such a good time. Visit me soon! Goodbye. Goodbye. Shall we go home? Bertram, come with mom. Let's hope aunt Gyda got the right painting.
