I understand but you're not listening to me. I can't keep it a secret. I won't. We'll talk about it after the show. I have to go. [muffled screaming] Come on, Parker. We're gonna be late. Parker. I have to wait for grandpa. Well who's idea was it to sit in the back seat? [chuckles] Mine, grandpa. Come on. Uh, dad, where's the camera? Don't you have your phone? No, the camera takes better video. Sam's really upset he has to be out of town for work this week. Never mind Sam. mom called half the city trying to get someone to cover for her at the church bazaar. And I'll never hear the end of it if I don't capture every second on film. Maybe we should use a phone and the camera just in case. Ok. Sorry gang, but you can't park here. Anywhere behind the yellow line would be great. Oh sure, sorry. Hailey, can you bring Parker inside? It would be my honour. Come on. Let's go. So how're you feeling, kiddo? About what? It's not my first concert. But it is your first solo. I'm not scared. Why do adults always think that kids are scared? Kids have it totally together, adults not so much. I gotta go backstage. Ok, break a leg. But not really. Don't really... break the leg. If the students were as conscientious as you I'd be out of a job. Well, I guess for your sake I'm glad they aren't. You're not staying? No. School can't afford to pay me overtime. But I shall still be here in the morning. It's for a good cause. Every penny Miss Sacks raises, keeps a roof over our heads. So when will the construction be finished? Ah, this roof needs a lot of work. I mean, I guess when they finish paying for it. Yeah. Excuse me. You ok? Yeah. I guess there's no accounting for some people. Well, have a good night. Yes, you enjoy. Thank you. They're running a little late, aren't they? The concert should have started 15 minutes ago. Tell you what, I'll go find out what's going on. Dad, you're off duty. Lucas? Norman. Good to see you. How've you been? I'm ok. I can't thank you enough for coming to my wife's funeral. And I know Naomi really appreciated it, too. Oh, you're Miss Sacks's father. She's my niece's favourite teacher. I think she's everyone's favourite these days. If it wasn't for her fundraising the school board would have sold this place long ago. And it's not like there's a shortage of buyers. I can't imagine splitting up Parker's friends never mind having to drive an extra half hour to a different school. Naomi says the same thing. And once she gets an idea into her head there's no stopping her. I can relate. [everyone laughs] Oh. Oh, see you later. Yeah. Uh, nice meeting you. You too. Good evening everyone, and welcome to Howell Elementary's Spring fundraising concert. [applause] We have a great program planned for you this evening. But first, we're all aware of the ongoing repairs here at the school and we are very grateful for your generous support and donations. What you may not know is the person behind the donation drive and the fight to save Howell Elementary is also directing the first musical group on our program. So let's give a big round of applause in appreciation for our choral music teacher, the hero of Howell Elementary, and as of today, our new vice principal, Miss Naomi Sacks. [applause] Woo-hoo! [applause] [whispering] What do you think's going on? I have no idea. Uh, I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, it seems that Miss Sacks is not here yet so without further ado Miss Janine Harwick will lead off our program. On with the show! [applause] ♪ I can't imagine what could keep Miss Sacks from being here. I hope she's alright. ♪ Nice work today. Now you have Parker's solo stuck in my head, too. She was so good. You wanna catch a movie tonight? I'm meeting Jonas. Don't you have plans with Wade? Not tonight. You know, I've been thinking this office needs a little sprucing up. Sabrina, the last time you felt the urge to re-decorate your high school boyfriend had just gotten married. What's going on? Nothing's going on, just bills. More bills. Ooh, a shiny pretty envelope just for you. Aren't you gonna open it? I know what it is. It's an invitation to Will's college baseball team reunion. Isn't that next weekend? That's cutting it close. Well, they didn't have my address until one of the wives tracked me down last week. Oh, and you said that you might have a conference in New York, I recall. I'm not proud of it. I panicked. So you didn't RSVP? I haven't decided if I'm going. Avoidance isn't a healthy strategy. Are you saying that as my friend, my colleague, or sometimes shrink? All of the above. Hmm. [buzzer] That's my next patient, but we're not done talking about this yet. Aren't we? Thank you for dinner, Hailey. What a treat. Wasn't it, Parker? A well-deserved celebration of Parker's triumph at her concert. That was two days ago, Aunty Hailey. And I still can't get your song out of my head. She was good, wasn't she? A star in the making. So how was the rest of your week at school? Alright, I guess. I mean, Miss Harwick isn't as much fun as Miss Sacks. Miss Sacks, is she the one who didn't show up for the concert? Is she sick? No one really knows. Apparently Miss Sacks sent Principal Barker an email saying she was taking some time off. And the worst part is she never got to meet Aunt Hailey. Parker, I'm sure she has other things to worry about. No. Miss Sacks asked me if you were going to be at the concert. She wanted to meet you because you used to work for the District Attorney. Parker, why don't you go on in the kitchen and cut yourself a piece of chocolate cake for dessert? Can I, mom? Well, we are celebrating, after all. Go on. So Miss Sacks quits a school she's dedicated to saving right before a benefit concert she spent weeks preparing? It doesn't sit right with me, either. Should we be worried? I don't know. Oh jeez. Wow. That is the biggest piece of chocolate cake I've ever seen. Big enough for all of us to share? I'd like to share it. I think I need a forklift though. Ah, ah, ooh. [knocking] Knock, knock. Come in. Are you ready for the movie? I have not been to a matinee in forever. Yeah, just give me a minute. Social media. You are the last person I think would be on there. You're right. It's my sister's account. Your sister's name isn't Naomi Sacks. Unless you have another sister. No, I'm sorry. It's my niece Parker's music teacher. And you're checking her out because...? Well, she didn't show up for Parker's concert and she hasn't been back at work since. So... no movie? Let's go for a walk instead. Come on. So this feels slightly longer than a short walk because I didn't bring my walking shoes. This is such a nice street. What are you up to, Hailey Dean? Nothing. Nothing. But this might be the street where Parker's teacher lives. Which house is hers? I think it's this one. I recognize it from the social media accounts. [knocking] If she's home she's not answering. There's no car in the driveway. Dirty dishes in the sink. And a laundry hamper of unfolded clothes on the table. It doesn't seem like the house of someone who was planning on leaving for a while. Maybe she had to leave quickly. She was running from something? Or didn't plan on leaving at all. But you said she sent an email to the principal, so whether she planned it or not she must have had her reasons. She might not wanna be found. Maybe. But I just have a bad feeling about this. Well, feelings or no, there isn't much you can do in this case, Hailey. Well, this is a nice surprise. It's not every day I get to have coffee with one of my two favourite daughters. I had some time between patients. Dad have you seen Naomi Sacks's father recently? Normal called me yesterday. How did you know? If I disappeared you'd be calling everyone who'd ever met me. Poor Norman. He's really worried, and I was no help. Has he been to the police? He filed a missing persons report but nothing so far. What do you think's going on? I didn't know Naomi outside of her fundraising efforts. She's really been single-handedly keeping the school open. The school board can only pay so much per school for maintenance and, well, Howell Elementary is so much more. What happens if they can't fix it? Well, the land will be sold and the children will be sent to other schools in the district. Hmm. Hi. Hey, Miss Dean. You here to pick up your niece? It's Hailey, please. I am. I'm a little early. Maybe I should wait in the office? Yeah, it's just around the corner here. Thanks. Watch your step. Ok. Who's going to officially take over Naomi's duties? I haven't decided. There's nothing to decide. We've already discussed this. Principal Becker? Yes? I'm sorry, but no one's allowed to wait in the school until the final bell has rung. Oh, I'm just here to pick up my niece, Parker. I'm Hailey Dean. Sorry to be so brusque. We've had a rash of thefts lately and um, the construction's been very disruptive. It's quiet now, no construction? It's been halted for a couple of weeks. Oh. Well, I imagine it'll start again soon. I'm not sure. I noticed that you were having a conversation with that teacher- Oh, yes. Uh, Miss Harwick. It was nothing, I assure you. She feels very strongly about her place here in the school. But if you would like to wait for the final bell, please be comfortable. Oh, I did want to ask you about Miss Sacks. The music teacher? Parker said that she was hoping to meet with me the night of the concert and I just was wondering why. Well, I can't say for sure but Parker does speak about you a great deal so perhaps she just wanted to put a face to the name. You're probably right. But I'm wondering if there was maybe something bothering her lately? She may have been a little preoccupied, not quite herself, but I don't pry into the personal lives of my teachers. Of course not. [bell rings] Oh, well, duty calls. Or, in this case, rings. Uh, please make yourself comfortable. It was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Naomi's father reported her missing two days after the concert. He didn't believe this email, her quitting her job. This is the email that Naomi Sacks sent to Principal Becker? At 7:16pm on Wednesday. From where? According to the IP address from the school. So she was inside the school before the concert started? Something must have happened that forced her to leave. Unless she didn't leave at all. The security tape isn't going to help us with that. It tapes over itself every 72 hours and we just missed the loop. We've only got up until 6:00pm. It's better than nothing. According to the notes in the file, Naomi left the school at 4:00pm. (Hailey): Wait, I know that guy. I saw him at the concert. He bumped into me as he was leaving. He seemed really nervous, even scared. Like he had just done something wrong? Maybe. Who is he? We don't know. We have yet to identify him. So that's it? Not quite. Naomi went back just before 6:00pm. That's odd. Not if she was going to a concert. So she was at the school at 6:00. That explains the email. But not why she would resign out of nowhere and on the night of her big concert. When did she leave? We don't know. Was her car there the next day? No. What about after the concert? No one remembers. Principal Becker said that he locked the school doors at 9:00 pm but there were apparently still a number of families getting themselves organized. So no one knows who was the last to leave and in the commotion no one remembers if Naomi's car was there or not. Are there phone records? She received a phone call at 6:30pm from an unregistered number. A burner phone. Not much of a lead but we'll see where it takes us. Let's put an APB out on her car. Naomi's probably fine but I think we'd all like to be sure. Ok. I thought you said we were going to eat? You know the DA's office only gives me an hour for lunch. You're one of their investigators. You say you're on schedule. Yes, and right now my schedule is saying it's time to check out that new food truck I was telling you about. You know, they say it's the best burritos in the city? You say that about every new food truck. Yes, but this time it's actually true. Now I get to try one for myself. We won't be here long, I just need you to buy me some privacy. Woah, what're you gonna do? I'm just gonna have a peek around. What? Hailey? Hey, Fincher, Naomi Sacks was here the night of the concert and I have a feeling she didn't leave by choice. What do you expect to find in a school that's used every day? It's not being used, not all of it. Fincher, if you were missing, wouldn't you want me to come look for you? Fine. Ok. Five minutes. Ok. Burritos on me. Yeah. That's Principal Becker. Go distract him. Becker? Did you say Becker? Becker. Hey. Principal Becker. How're you doin'? Fincher Garland, investigator for the DA's office. Yes. Could I talk to you for a second? Of course. No one could survive that much blood loss. You were right, Hailey. I would give anything to be wrong. I'm gonna go tell the DA what's happening here. Are you gonna be ok? Yeah. Thanks. Alright. Is... is that, uh... Blood? It's Miss Sacks, isn't it? You're the janitor? Yeah, Rob. Do you usually clean this area up? Uh, no. No, construction zones are off limits. Does anyone have access to your supplies? Yeah, everybody. The lock on my cupboard's been broken for weeks. Go with the janitor and collect all his cleaning supplies for testing. Hey Danny, I found this earring. I'll see if Naomi's father can identify this in case the blood is too degraded for a DNA test. Do you want me to be there? Yes. Thanks. Danny? So this is now a homicide investigation? Attempted homicide, at least. Were the doors locked when you arrived the morning after the concert? Yes, I was the first one here at 7:00 am. But all the teachers have keys. I'd like to address the staff if possible. Of course. I have them gathering in my office. We have reason to believe Naomi Sacks was the victim of an attack on the night of the fundraising concert. Do you know where she is? Not yet. But rest assured we're doing everything we can to find her. Is she dead? We don't know. We'll be conducting interviews with all the staff. You're accusing one of us? Janine, think about someone else for once. Don't tell me what to do. Don't be such a bully, Janine. Coming to Mary's rescue, are we? Of course we will all do what we can and we will make ourselves available to the police whenever they need us. And then I saw the blood and then I called you guys. What about the night of the concert? There were so many people there. Um, the concert was supposed to start at 7:00 but Principal Becker didn't do his introduction until I think after 7:15. Waiting for Naomi to arrive. I guess. And then Miss Harwick came up to him and told him, with a very satisfied look on her face, that Naomi wasn't there. And then I saw two teachers leave the auditorium right as the concert was starting. Janine Harwick. She didn't seem too upset today, either. No. And the two teachers that called her out were the two teachers that left the auditorium. I think um... one was Miss Lewis. And the male teacher I don't know. Uh, Nicholas Demaschuk, teaches computers. [message alert] It's Jonas. He's got something. Ok, I will stay here and finish Hailey's statement. It should be ready to sign in about half an hour or so. And I might as well tag along. As if you need an excuse. The blood you found at the school was very degraded. The nuclei were mostly destroyed from the cleaning solvent but I am working on the small sample that wasn't touched, trying to isolate some viable DNA. In the meantime I can tell you the blood type is AB positive. The second rarest blood type. And what about Naomi Sacks? According to her school records she's also AB positive. Now, it isn't definitive, but I think you can operate under the assumption the blood belongs to Naomi. What are the odds she's still alive? Slim at best. That was a sizeable blood pool. She would have been lying there for some time. I guess you can't tell us what caused it? Not until you find her. Thanks Jonas. Thanks Jonas. Bye. Thanks for your statement, Hailey. Of course. So what now? The most important thing is trying to find Naomi. The trace on Naomi's phone came up with nothing. It must be dead. Can you trace the last time her phone was on? We're working on it. What about Naomi's car? Nothing so far. And the search of her house didn't help, either. No sign of distress, no sign of travel. And if she had a computer it isn't there now. So I know that we already have her school email but did she have a personal account? Without Naomi's computer or her phone we can't find an email address other than her school account. Assuming she used another account, which she might not have. She sent plenty of personal emails from her school address, none of which have been helpful. Other than that last email to Principal Becker, which we know was sent from the school. But Naomi might not have been the one that sent it. She could have been forced to write it under duress. Either way, our suspect was in the school the night of the concert. What about the guy Naomi was arguing with in the parking lot? He's number one on our list. We're still trying to identify him. I might know who to ask. Naomi's mother, God rest her soul, gave her these earrings the day she got her first teaching job. I know this is very difficult but do you think you can manage watching some security footage? Yeah, whatever it takes. Yes. Do you know the man Naomi's talking to? Unfortunately. And I'll bet he's behind all of this. It's Jeff Adkins. Naomi's no good ex-boyfriend. No good how? Well, he was never good enough for her. And when Naomi broke up with him last month he just wouldn't get over it. What do you mean by that? He showed up everywhere she went. He hung around the school. He made her nervous. I told her to take out a restraining order against him but she was too nice, too forgiving. Admirable qualities. Yeah. You are going to find her, aren't you? We're doing everything we can. I only pray it isn't too late. Just up ahead, not much further. Do you even know where we are? Yeah, yeah. It's just up here. Why don't you just give me the address so I know where I'm going? It's more fun this way. You always wait until the last possible moment to tell me which way to turn and then inevitably I am in the wrong lane. Yeah, like I said, more fun. [laughs] This better be a good burrito. Good? Nah. This burrito is sublime. It is superlative. It is trans- Scendent. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocio us. Yeah, that too. Times 1,000. Ooh, turn right here. (Fincher): Ok. (Hailey): Is it an invisible burrito? I'm so confused. Look, it says right here. "Go to west parking lot noon to 4:00pm on the 27th." Oh Fincher, yesterday was the 27th. Today is the 28th. No. Yes. No. Oh. I'm sorry. We'll find it another day, ok? I- I better call Danny and tell him to get his own lunch. [phone vibrating] Sorry Hailey, can't talk. Naomi's house alarm was just tripped. It's being broken into. Woah, Woah, Woah. I wanna live to see tomorrow's burrito. (Fincher): Ok, I'm gonna go around back. You wait here until Danny arrives. You promise, Hailey? I promise. Ok, I'm gonna go look around. Mmmhmm. Ok. Here. Right here. [door opens] Drive. Can we just- I said drive. Hey! Hey! Hailey! Where are we going? Just keep driving. It's Jeff, isn't it? How did you know that? I'm Hailey. I can help you. No, you can't. The police just wanna talk to you. They won't listen to me. I'll listen. Turn- turn right. Right here. Naomi wanted to meet me the day she disappeared. Do you know why? She said there'd be consequences. What consequences? I have to fix this. Let me help you fix it. Jeff, Naomi wanted my help. She would want me to help you, too. Stop! Pull the car over right here. Stop the car! Right here! Ok. Pull over! But Jeff, I can help you, please. Stop the car. I will help you. Get out. I said get out! Ok! Now back away. Back away. Hailey! Hailey, you promised. And I kept my promise. I stayed in the car and look what happened. There's no time for jokes. I'm ok, Fincher. Well I'm not. You're my best friend, Hailey Dean. What am I gonna do without you? You're my best friend too, Fincher Garland. You got carjacked. Did I really? Yeah. Is that what that's called? Yeah. Let's go get him. He just kept saying he needed to fix it. Fix what? I don't know but whatever it is he needed to fix was probably in the envelope he was holding. It must be why he wanted to go to Naomi's house. I don't see an envelope listed from the original search. Well, it was nondescript. There was nothing written on it. Your police officers wouldn't have looked twice at it. What else can you tell me? He was desperate. But I never felt like he was going to pull the trigger. All I felt was this tremendous sadness from him. He was grieving. For killing Naomi. Then why do it? Some killers are conflicted. They can't help the compulsion or they feel this perceived moral obligation but they love their victims. And Jeff Adkins clearly loved Naomi. We found your car, Hailey. Safe and sound. It was abandoned a couple blocks from where Adkins left you. And what about Adkins? He's in the wind. There's an APB out with your detailed description of him. It's only a matter of time before we find him. [knocking] You have a minute? Is it to talk about carpet colours? Because then no. I value your opinion, Hailey. My opinion is that you are avoiding dealing with whatever it is that's bothering you by coming up with an unnecessary project. Just like you're avoiding making a decision about the reunion? Don't change the subject. What's going on, Sabrina? Why this sudden need for drastic change? Now who's changing the subject? [buzzing] Do you have another patient this evening? I don't think so. Well, I'll leave you to it. Tomorrow we can talk about paint colours. Excuse me. Hailey? Clyde Bennett. It's been a long time. And now we learned traces of her blood found in the school... Listen, I hope I wasn't interrupting. Oh, I was done for the day. ...we can now confirm of the missing teacher, Atlanta homicide has been called in... We can confirm that. That lady loves crime. It's a horrible, horrible story. Yeah. Naomi Sacks is not missing. She's dead. You- you look amazing. You look exactly the same. You haven't changed, either. Will always said you could charm a statue into smiling. [laughs] You know, I- I've tried to reach you at the DA's office dozens of times over the years. I know, I'm sorry I never called back. It's taken me a long time to deal with what happened to Will. Yeah. You happy? I am happy. How about you? You still in the family business? Construction? Um, we've moved more into uh, real estate development. We just opened an office on Ellis. You should come by sometime. On Ellis? You're doing well. Listen, I gotta ask you. Did you get the invitation to the reunion? I did. Ok. But you haven't RSVP'd. I know. I'm sorry. It's- it's not that I wouldn't like to see all of you. I- I get it. It probably is bringing up ghosts you're trying to leave behind. Will will always be with me. But it's just, you know, all those memories of that time with the team and what happened. Yeah, I- I think about how I would have reacted if I had been there when Will was sh- shot. I can't imagine what it's been like for you. I hope you never have to. Listen. If you choose to come to the reunion we will all be thrilled. But if you don't, I would really like to stay in touch with you this time. I'd like that, too. Hey. To what do I owe this honour? A mid-afternoon visit with coffee? Are you here to bribe me for information about the case? Because you already know everything. No. I actually wanted to talk to you about something. [laughs] Uh-oh. It's nothing like that. I've uh, I've been invited to a reunion. Uh-oh. It's Wills varsity baseball team. Ah. And you don't know if you wanna go. I haven't seen most of these people since Will's funeral. They all wanted to keep in touch. I wasn't ready for that. Not then and maybe not now. But this isn't about them, is it? It's about Will. Yeah. [sighs] Hailey, I know how painful some of your memories are. But those guys on Will's team loved him, too. They want to honour him and they wanna share that with you. I know. You might find some of those shared memories comforting. You're right. Annoyingly. [laughs] And hey, it's one night. What have you got to lose? Maybe you'll even surprise yourself and have a good time. I'll think about it. Hey. Guess you still haven't found Jeff Adkins. Not yet. That was a phone trace on Naomi's cell. It hasn't given out a signal since Wednesday. Since she went missing. And the last cell tower it pinged off of at 9:53pm was just outside the city. Right here. There's nothing around there but undeveloped land. It'd be a good place to dump a cell phone. Or a body. Who would wanna live out here? With the way the city's growing, a lot of people. Or if you ever wanted to hide something you didn't want found. Come on. Danny. Yeah. Danny, it's a cell phone. Naomi's car was just called in. It's about 15 minutes away at the bus depot. So the killer dropped the body and made for the next bus out of town? It's possible, though it's more likely the killer's trying to send us on a wild goose chase. We know Jeff Adkins didn't leave town. Given the state he was in in my car I doubt he had the presence of mind to set up that kind of deflection. We'll see if we can get security footage from the bus station but it'll be a long shot at best. I can understand why the killer would leave her here. By the time constructions started the body would be well on its way to decomposing and the killer long gone. Speaking of construction I have the enviable task of informing the property owner that his recent purchase is now a crime scene. So Wolverine Developments is Clyde Bennett. I haven't heard that name in years. What's he doing at the Peach Plaza Hotel instead of at work on a weekday? Planning a reunion. A reunion? How many years have you guys been- You don't need to say the number, thanks Danny. Ok. Wow, this is bringing me back. And I didn't even go to Atlanta State. Hailey? Hi. I did not expect to see you here. Hey Clyde, good to see you again. Danny. Danny Morgan? Wow, it's great to see you. The room looks amazing. Oh, thanks. This is nothing. Wait 'til you see when it's done. This is all so surreal. I feel like I'm back in Will's dorm room. Yes, minus the smell of sweaty socks and three-day-old pizza. Listen, give me a second. I gotta just check on the slide show, ok? Oh wow. Hailey? You ok? Yeah. It just surprised me. I don't think I've seen that one before. [deep sigh] Yeah. I think that's probably my favourite photo of Will. You remember that day, Hailey? It was taken just after practise on the day he proposed to you. I remember. Listen, Clyde, do you have a minute to talk? Sure. Um, come here. You guys want some coffee or something? Sure. Yeah. That is terrible. She- she was a teacher? My niece's teacher, in fact. Wow. How- how did she end up on my land? That's what we're trying to find out. Do you have any security in place? No, I mean I just closed on that lot a month ago. Normally I don't start security until I've got all my building permits and it's gonna be a while before that happens. We'll need access to it. Sure. Listen, whatever you need. Thanks, Clyde. It really is great to see you. You too. Little Danny Morgan. Homicide detective. Wow. If only your brother could see you now. He'd be very proud. Yeah. So am I gonna see you this weekend, Hailey? I'll let you know. Ok. And Danny, listen. You are- you are more than welcome to join. It's as much about Will as it is all of us. Well thanks, I'll be in touch. Ok. [message alert] Jonas? Autopsy results are in. Naomi Sacks was hit in the head consistent with the amount of blood residue found at the school. But that's not what killed her. Then how did she die? Asphyxiation. She was strangled. Strangled? How did that work? If I had to guess I'd say she fell backwards, hitting her head. The fall would have knocked the fight out of her, which explains why I didn't find any defensive wounds and the killer would have been able to strangle her without much resistance. What about time of death? Hard to pinpoint the exact time, but I can say with some certainty she died last Wednesday. Lividity suggests the body was moved before rigour set in, so within four hours of her death. So she was killed sometime between 6:00pm and 7:00am the next morning? Mmmhmm. And moved the same night. And the email was sent at 7:15pm, which was either before or just after she died. Given the cause of death I would say after. Why do you say that? The killer lured her to a construction site hoping to scare her and when she wouldn't do what they wanted the killer flew at her in a rage and strangled her. It has all the hallmarks of a crime of passion. It fits with Adkins. He wanted her back, she refused. But what did Adkins wanna fix? Naomi was already dead when he carjacked me, and what was in that envelope? We won't know until we find him. [phone ringing] Oh, excuse me. It's Clyde. Hi, Clyde. Can I call you later? Uh, yeah. I'm actually here with Danny. We'll be right there. There's another body on Clyde's land. Given what happened I was thinking of setting up security here so I stopped by to find out exactly what I'd need and I found this. Jeff Adkins. You know who he is? We've been looking for him. This is not how I hoped we'd find him. This feels too familiar, Danny. On purpose, maybe. Adkins has a gun shot wound to the head and the gun was beside his body. Murder-suicide case? That's my working theory. I mean, why else would he come back to where Naomi's body was found? And how would he have known her body was left here if he didn't do it? Excuse me. I don't know how you stay so calm. Not my first crime scene. You know, the police have never caught Will's killer and I'm guessing all these years later they probably just stopped looking. Well, it's listed on their books as a cold case if that's what you're asking, but according to Danny it's officially inactive. That's why he joined the police department, isn't it? I mean, he's never said it, but we both know it's true. He doesn't get much time to work on it, though. Did the police know anything? I mean, do they think it was random? It wasn't random. But why would somebody wanna murder Will? No, Will wasn't the target. I was. Why on earth would anyone wanna kill you? Believe me, Clyde, I wish I knew. Strange, isn't it? Two bodies on your land. Why, I wonder? I'm asking myself the exact same thing. You didn't know either of the victims? No. It just feels like they were both here for a reason. Well, maybe because it's an overgrown, abandoned piece of land? Maybe. What, do you think something else is going on here? It's certainly possible. Do I need to get a lawyer? I'm sorry. Too many years in the DA's office. Listen, I'm- I'm really sorry that I wasn't there for you after Will died. I should have been. It was hard on all of us. I never blamed you, Clyde. Yeah, but still, I'm just sorry that we drifted apart. Me too. (Fincher): Very nice of you to come by and visit me, you know, and bring me hot chocolate, but shouldn't you be sleeping? And miss this? What is it exactly you're doing? Mmm. Working. Ah. Yeah, you remember the actual job that pays me to investigate cases for the District Attorney? We're on a stake-out. No, we are not on a stake-out. I am on a stake-out. And before you even ask I cannot tell you who I'm following, but I've been following this dude for like three nights and all he does is sleep in his car. That sounds like a bust. Yeah, I knew it would be, but you know. Due diligence. I remember it well. So... what's bugging you? Who says something's bugging me? You did when you came to visit me in the middle of the night. I don't know, I guess I'm just feeling a little responsible. For what? Jeff Adkins. Hailey. That guy kidnapped you. He probably killed his girlfriend. He had a bunch of serious problems. Come on. I could have done more. No. That guy was gonna do whatever he was gonna do. You know, I didn't get that vibe from him, Fincher. What did I miss? Nothing. Just like there was nothing you could have done to change things. You know that. [sighs] Knowing and feeling are two different things. Hailey Dean, let me tell you something. You always put everybody before yourself. Too much so in my humble opinion. I don't. No, no, no, no, no. You're always putting yourself in these crazy dangerous situations, trying to help anybody you can. If you even think that you can do more for someone, think again. Thank you, Fincher. Don't thank me. You know I got your back. I know you do. Alright. Now you feel better? I feel... hungry. Mmm. Now that's a feeling I can get behind. Hang on, I got my stake-out stash. Mmmhmm. There you go. Oh, I'm sorry. An apple? Who are you and what have you done with my friend Fincher? Uh, it's burritos by day, apples by night. That's not a thing. Oh yes, it's a thing. For real. How can I argue with that logic? Mmm. You don't wanna be in a car with me and burritos- I know that, I know that. You gotta have something else. No, I got nothin'. I got nothin'. I don't know what you're talking about. Except uh, what's that? Oh. Oh, chips. No, I don't want this apple. I want- give me your chips. No. I have- no. No. [laughs] Thank you. Her body has just been found discarded at an abandoned lot on the county line but at this hour a shock twist. Naomi Sacks's estranged "boyfriend", also found dead by a gun shot wound to the head according to our sources. Is this gorgeous young teacher the victim of a break-up gone wrong? Naomi's family, devastated. Coffee? Oh, great. Thanks Hailey. Did you talk to Norman Sacks? This morning. I wanted him to hear it from me and not the news. I'm sure he appreciated that. I had a long conversation with Clyde. Do you think he's in on this? He did get a bit defensive when I brought it up. It could just be a coincidence. Though it does seem like this land was chosen for a reason. Like Adkins was trying to tell us something? Did you find the envelope he took from Naomi's house? Not yet. So Jeff Adkins kills Naomi in a fit of passion, dumps her body in a vacant lot, breaks into her house to steal an envelope, contents unknown, runs from the police only to go back to the same lot and shoot himself. You of all people know that murder isn't always rational. And if I hadn't met him I'd think there was some kind of poetic justice in all of this but... But? Jeff Adkins had a purpose. Whatever it is he needed to fix was in that envelope and he was willing to risk anything to do it. Then why kill himself? Hi. What do you think? It's different. Better, right? Different is not always better, just... different. Yeah. Well, it's a start. At least until we pick out new furniture. Sabrina, I care about you. Something is obviously bothering you so why don't you just save us both the bruises and tell me what's going on? [buzzing] My next patient. I checked the date. I checked the time. I quadruple checked, ok? The food truck is at the lot right now. I'm not getting my hopes up. Oh ye of little faith. What's this? Oh, it's an invitation to Will's baseball team reunion. Oh. You're going, right? Et tu, Fincher? We can talk about this over the burrito. Well, we are best friends. I am not embarrassed about that, ok? I'm a grown man that's comfortable expressing the way he feels about people he cares about. Some people in your profession might say that's healthy. Well, as your best friend I feel as though I should break the news to you. [laughs] What's that? There's no food truck. [laughs] Very funny. No. No! Is the food truck even real? Of course! You wouldn't lie to your best friend would you, Fincher? I can't believe this is happening. Come on, Fincher. I mean, all I'm saying is if you wanna spend time with me you don't have to make up a phantom food truck to do so. I'm so hungry right now. Well luckily I came prepared. You brought along emergency food rations? [message alert] I don't know whether to be offended or be grateful. Well, decide later. Adkins's autopsy results are in. Jonas and his good timing. We'll be alright. I've got your sandwich right here, ok? Don't eat it. I'm not gonna eat it. Gun shot to the right temporal lobe. The bullet matches the gun found at the crime scene. So it was suicide? The gun shot was not the cause of death. It was inflicted post-mortem. Let me guess. He was strangled. Yes. Just like Naomi Sacks. Double homicide. What's the connection? We know that Naomi had some information and we know that Jeff Adkins had the same information. So the killer agrees to meet up with Adkins and then kills him for whatever was in that envelope. Time of death? Around 6:00pm yesterday. But that is not all I have for you. This was found clutched in Adkins's hand. What is it? Numbers. Forensics has the slip of paper. So far no idea what it is or where it came from. Did it belong to Adkins or the person he was meeting? Maybe it's what was in the envelope. Let's hope they can figure out what it is. They also found a burner phone in the field with Adkins's prints on it. It's the same number that called Naomi the night that she died. Maybe that's why Adkins broke into Naomi's house. She told him that she had found something. Then why not just tell us? He didn't think the police would believe him. He didn't trust that he could finish what she had started. That's not all. The phone also called the school at 4:00pm the day that he was killed. So Adkins was setting up a meeting with someone at the school? Right back to where we started, which means re-interviewing the teachers. All 22 of them. Do you have the original interviews on tape? Of course. There might be a better way. How well do you know Naomi Sacks? As well as I know anyone around here. Anything unusual happen around the time she went missing? Just that she was promoted to vice principal. No one knows how that happened. I mean, Naomi's great but Janine has seniority. Janine? Harwick. She's not very happy about it. Janine? Harwick. She's not very happy about it. Tell me where you were the night of the concert. I was outside organizing parking. So you saw Naomi's car in her spot? I didn't notice but I suppose so. And after the concert you were back in the parking lot? I... I really don't remember. And then where did you go? Home to my husband. And then where did you go? Home to my husband. That's a lie. So have you found anything? I don't know. I can't tell anymore. Well if you can't find anything there's nothing to be found. I'm not superhuman, Fincher. Mmm, you kinda are. You can always tell when someone's lying or not telling the truth. Well, it's just body language, gestures, involuntary facial movements. But it doesn't work on everyone and it's easy to misread. Can you tell when I'm lying? Do you lie to me? Never. Well then I don't know. Ok. I'm gonna tell you two things and you tell me which one is a lie. It's not a party trick, Fincher. Just indulge me, ok? I'm just trying to make a point. Alright, fine. Go ahead. Lie to me. But make sure it's real. Ok. I feel like a disappointment to my father, and I don't wanna have kids. Which one's the lie? You're going to make a great dad someday. How did you know? You tilted your head to the left. I did not. Not on purpose. See? You do know what you're doing. And you're right, I'm gonna make an amazing father someday. I mean, that's obvious. Ok, calm down. [laughs] Now get back to those interviews. And call your dad. He's beyond proud of you. He told you that? It's written all over his face. [sighs] Hailey Dean. So I checked out the alibis for the night Naomi died for all the five teachers you thought were hiding something in their interviews. And? I can confirm all of them were at the concert but only three of them have questionable alibis for once the concert ended. Which ones? Uh, Mary Lewis, Nicholas Demaschuk and Janine Harwick. I guess we know who we talk to next. I don't know how I can help you. I don't know anything about what happened to Naomi. Here's the thing, Miss Lewis. You said you went home to your husband after the concert but I haven't been able to find a husband. You're not married. Well, yes. I meant- What did you mean? [sighs] I swear, I wasn't alone. Then who were you with? I can't tell you. Why don't you think about that answer while I grab a cup of coffee? Why is Miss Lewis here? She's got nothing to do with what happened to Naomi Sacks. Don't worry about her. Just answer the question. I told you last time. I left the concert around 8:00pm. I didn't notice who else was still there and I went out to eat with my brother. What restaurant? Lincoln's Diner. Lincoln's Diner. Anything? Maybe. That's not what you said last time. Then I was wrong. You pay with a credit card? Cash. And if I got the security tapes from Lincoln's Diner will you and your brother be on them? So both Mary Lewis and Nicholas Demaschuk are lying about where they were the night Naomi died. Put them together. I have a theory. Ok. I remember now. I saw them leave the auditorium together right as the concert was starting. We never considered two killers. They're not killers, Danny. They're in love. You can tell that? Well, see how they're connecting? They keep coming back to each other, they're whispering, keep looking at each other. That's a level of intimacy you don't have with your average colleague. And they were together that night? They're- they're lying for each other? Why? I'm sure the school has a rule against staff dating. They don't wanna lose each other or their jobs. Hmm. Ok, I'll go verify it and then I'll let them go. With a promise of discretion, of course. Wow, Monty, I didn't know you were such a romantic. And that just leaves Janine Harwick. Where is she? Good question. I was expecting her two hours ago. Detective Morgan, Miss Dean. What can I help you with? We're looking for Janine Harwick. She was supposed to come to the police station for questioning. Ah, well I'm afraid that's probably my fault. I've saddled her with just a ton of paperwork that's been piling up recently. Well, we need to speak with her now. Sure. She's probably in the vice principal's office. She was just promoted. [knocking] Miss Harwick? The police would like to have a... I'm sorry, I don't know where she is. So you think this Janine Harwick killed two people over a lost promotion? You don't run if you aren't guilty. Monty makes a good point. Naomi must have had something on Janine. Something secret. Everyone knew she was mad about the promotion. Hey. Yeah, Danny. Remember that APB you had out on Janine Harwick? Yeah, have you seen her? Yeah, I'm looking at her right now. I think she's ready to come in and talk. Yeah, she's not happy. Alright. See you soon. He's got Janine. I don't know what you're talking about. You wanted the promotion. Naomi got it instead of you. I didn't want the promotion. I deserved it. But you didn't. Naomi knew why. What're you talking about? You didn't kill Naomi over the promotion. You killed her because she discovered your secret. That's crazy. Then Jeff Adkins called you saying he knew what you did, you met him and you killed him, too. Prove it. Can you account for your whereabouts after the concert? And again two nights ago? I want a lawyer. She doesn't trust you. She's not going to talk. You wanna try? She's just so angry, it's masking everything else. I think she needs some time to let this all sink in first. We can hold her for another 18 hours. That's the best I can do. So you think Janine is the killer? She could be. Hmm. But you're not convinced. Everything just seems sideways right now, Jonas. I mean, Sabrina's got the office turned upside down, Fincher can't find his burrito truck. [laughs] And then there's all this stuff with the reunion. Just... it seems to soon somehow. Hey, listen to me. Will is a part of your life. My wife is a part of mine and I miss her every day. Those parts are ours to cherish. I mean, no one knows how you feel or what you need. Whatever you decide, trust that as the right decision. Wow. Wow, good? [doorbell rings] Wow, good. Pizza, finally. Oh, you must be Jonas. I'm Hailey's dad. Nice to finally meet you. You too, Mr. Dean. Look, call me Lucas. I intercepted the pizza- Dad? Hi Hailey. Um, I just thought I'd drop by and see how you were doing. It didn't occur to me that you might have company. I'll come back. No. You're staying. And you better get in here before that pizza gets cold. Please. A biology teacher. Mmmhmm. I had no idea. Yeah. Yeah, I loved it. I miss it, but being a school superintendent has its own challenges. How did you decide to become a medical examiner? Well, I was planning on a surgical residency after med school but then I did a pathology rotation at the New York City ME's office and I just thought it was, well, fascinating. Hmm. The rest is history. Let me clear this. No, dad, I got it. You sit. I'll help. It's not exactly how I thought you two would meet but I'm glad you're hitting it off. He's great. And I thought I was gonna get the third degree. Wait 'til you meet my mother. Hey kids, I should be getting home. I've got an early meeting to sign some final sale documents. Final sale? Yeah. I don't know how I'm gonna break this to Parker but Howell Elementary's been sold. That's a shame. But why? There's no more money. The fundraising account is empty and the school board, they can't afford to cover the overages and construction costs. Overages? How is that possible? I don't know. I haven't seen the books. All I know is I have the dubious honour of having to fight for parking on Ellis Street at 8:00am to sign on behalf of the school board. Ellis Street. Dad, who's the buyer? Wolverine Enterprises. Wolverine Enterprises? Are you saying Clyde Bennett bought the school? Yep. Hailey, let me do the talking. No promises. Hailey. Danny, Clyde was Will's best friend. I think I have the right to feel a little angry that he wasn't exactly forthcoming with me. Of course, you're allowed to feel whatever you want, which is why you should let me, the detective, do the talking. Just this once. Fine. Thank you. Hi guys. Uh, listen, I'm more than happy to help, I've just got a lot going on today so if we can make this quick- You bought the school. Yeah. Howell Elementary. You know about that? Yeah, my father is the superintendent. Oh, right. Of course. Lucas Dean. I met him this morning. Nice guy. So your plan finally worked. My plan? After all, Naomi Sacks was the only thing standing in your way. What're you talking about? You have to admit, Clyde, this doesn't look great. You're trying to buy the school and not sharing that information with us. Then the body of the woman who single-handedly was keeping the school open was found on your land. Wait. I had nothing to do with that. Then the body of her boyfriend was found by you on the same land only a few days later. Where's the envelope, Clyde? What envelope? We know Naomi had some information she was about to expose. This will go a whole lot better for you if you tell us what she knew. Wait, I don't know- I have nothing to hide. Ok? I have been completely upfront about my interest in purchasing that land since they started talking about selling it. Why? What's so special about this land? Because it's zoned residential, it's quiet, it's proximity to shopping. Hey, you know, another part of the deal involves building a school at cost. Why would a business man like you take that much of a loss? Because this is my town, too, ok? And I'm not about to cheat someone, or let alone kill them, over a few bucks. Ok? And any loss that I incur becomes a tax deduction. The city gets a brand new school at a fraction of the cost. Everyone wins. That's extremely generous of you. Thank you. Hailey. [sighs] Now, are we done? We'll need to verify your alibis for the nights of Naomi Sacks's and Jeff Adkins's deaths. So I'll need you to stick around for a while. Unbelievable. Can I at least call my office? Sure. You can use the phone at my desk. Hailey. What happened to you? You know exactly what happened to me. But that has nothing to do with today. But you honestly think that I could kill someone? Especially after what happened to Will? I don't wanna believe it but I also don't believe in coincidences. Well, things don't always happen for a reason. Sometimes they're just random. Not in my experience. Keep up the good work. I'll see you next week. I thought you weren't in today. I didn't wanna cancel my 10:00, he's at a critical points in his treatments. Just like I am at a critical point in my decorating. Yeah, about that- Yes, something is bothering me and yes I'm avoiding it by turning this office upside down, but- You don't wanna talk about it. No. But just because I'm avoiding my problems doesn't mean that you should. I'm not going to the reunion but not for the reason you think. Why then? Clyde Bennett. He bought Parker's school and he's closing it down. And he might have killed two people to do it. Do you believe that? I don't know what I believe. Well, it's not like you to let your personal feelings cloud your professional judgement. So we're back to Janine Harwick but she still isn't talking. And we haven't found out what Naomi could have found out about her that would make her worth killing over. And we need more evidence tying her to the murders. What if you follow the money? What money? The fundraised money. There should be tens of thousands of dollars but it's gone, my dad said. Construction is expensive. But what about the concert? That was just last week. And construction on the school hasn't resumed. When I called the construction company after Naomi disappeared they never said why construction had halted. Let me give them another call. So uh, I think I'm gonna go to the reunion. I'm guessing after that last conversation with Clyde you're probably not? I don't think so. I get it. Clyde's not the guy you remember. But we're all different now. They might have some stories about Will I've never heard before. Danny, you don't have to justify it. I'm glad you're going. Ok, that was a bit strange. The construction company said they were donating their labour. The school was only paying for the materials. And the money Naomi fundraised wasn't enough? That's the thing. They worked for six months, never got paid a single cent. How is that possible? That must be what Naomi discovered. The money was being stolen from the school. That's why she wanted to talk to me and that's what Jeff Adkins had to fix. And that's what got them both killed. Anything yet? We're subpoenaing the school's bank records as well as the separate fundraising account, the construction company's, and Janine Harwick's. Wow. I don't envy who has to go through all that paperwork. Why would Janine steal the money? It would only put her out of a job and it seems the only thing she cares about is her career. Because without the money the school would be sold which would put Naomi out of a job, too. If Janine couldn't be vice principal no one could. Vindictive. And consistent with her behaviour. Let me know if you find anything. Will do. You don't have to do this, Hailey. Spend your break with a broken old man. You are not old and broken. You're grieving and you need friends. Mmm. You remind me of Naomi. That same determination. She'd get a bee in her bonnet and never let go. Like saving the school. She'd be so upset to hear what's happening. I know. She tried her best. Everyone admired her for it. Thanks. And thanks for indulging me, but I think you really need to get back to work. I'm alright. No, I'm gonna meet your father here in a little bit anyway, so go on. Alright. But here. What's this? It's my card, so you can call me anytime or, if you feel more comfortable, my email's on there. Naomi made me get an email address but she was the only one who ever sent me anything. I could never even remember to check it. I don't know. Call me old fashioned but I'd rather talk to somebody face to face instead of by computer. Naomi sent you emails you haven't read? Oh yeah. She used to complain about that almost every day. Mr. Sacks, your daughter's left you a gift. There are new conversations you have yet to have with her. I never thought about it that way. Don't rush. Just read them when you're ready to hear her voice again. Thank you. Take care. Yeah, you too. What're you doing here? Your chariot awaits. I already ate. Oh wow. You know what? I've given up on that food truck. I think you're right. It doesn't exist. Fincher don't ever give up on your dreams. Anyways, we have more important things to do at the school. The school? Yeah. I found out that the janitor has a record. He's been convicted twice before for theft. And you think he took the fundraised money? That's terrible. A leopard never changes his spots. Why aren't we taking this to Danny? I figured this one could use a friendly touch. You know, especially given his history with the law. And I remember you said the janitor has a soft spot for you. I mean, I pick up my trash. It's only common decency. Don't even get me started about people's bad manners. Like telling people there's a food truck some place with- with delicious burritos and- Yeah, that's just a lie. You know? It's ridiculous. The nerve of people. Bad manners. Hailey Dean, what a nice surprise. What brings you to my dungeon? Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. How long have we known each other? Oh, I don't know. Two years? And I've always thought of you as a good man. You're kind to the kids, you have the patience of a saint. Well, we were all kids once. So I'm gonna be straight with you. The police know that you used to steal things. I see. So this isn't a... a warning so I can make a quick getaway? Well, the thing is the money that Naomi Sacks raised to save the school is missing. Wait. So you can understand why the police would be turning their attention to you. You don't believe that. I don't want to. I never stole any money. I would never do that. I mean, I- I stole some things that I thought nobody would miss. I mean, a janitor's salary is not much and, you know, ever since the cut-backs I've been working the jobs of three people. I- I don't- I don't have time for another job. That's a lame excuse. I never took the money, but there has been some other stuff. What am I supposed to do? Well, you can start by giving the police a full confession and then give back all the things you've taken. I'll lose my job. I could go to jail. You'll accept the consequences of your actions because at heart you are a decent man. Maybe once I was. Rob, we all do things out of anger and desperation. It's not too late to start again. I don't know if I have that much faith in myself anymore. I have faith in you. You should have this. Is that- Miss Sacks's laptop. I stole it. I was gonna sell it. I already erased the hard drive, I'm sorry. Maybe- maybe you know somebody who can get it back. Yeah, maybe I can. Thank you. Thanks for the heads up. The janitor gave us a full confession and his alibi checks out for the night Adkins died. He's not the killer but he did say he had Naomi Sacks's laptop only he wouldn't say where it is now. Don't ask. Hailey, that's evidence. Evidence that's been corrupted and I'm working on getting it back to you much faster than your techs could. Did you call- you know what? I don't wanna know. In fact, we never had this conversation. As far as I'm concerned, Naomi's laptop is still missing. Wait for it to show up sometime tomorrow morning. Nope. I guess you didn't say hi to my cousin Danny for me. Yeah, not this time. Are you sure your clients are ok with me being here? Yeah, it's fine. Honest. I'm still setting up their systems. They just moved in. So how's it going? Getting there. Most of the files are corrupted but I think I can salvage them. I just need a few more minutes. Need anything? Food. That can be arranged. Speaking of which, how hard is it to track a food truck? Uh, not hard as long as there's an onboard GPS but one miracle at a time. I got something. Numbers. Yeah, bank records. Transfer of funds. [whistles] That's a lot of funds. To an unnamed account. No- no, not unnamed. It was transferred to an email address. Senderout? Yeah, it's one of those web-based emails you can check from anywhere, you can use any name to sign up with. And that email is attached to a bank account? But you can't open a bank account without your real name and a social security number. No, but you can open an online gambling account. See? All the funds were transferred Online gambling. Well that explains how thousands of dollars disappeared so quickly. Can you hack into their system and get a name? Of course. Of course. But I don't need to. Naomi already did. Can you print this out for me? Uh, I'll just forward you and Danny the email. All of this was in an attachment in a sent message. Who did she send it to? Danny, Norman isn't answering his landline. He's not home. And my dad said that he told him he had something to take care of at the school. Wait for me outside, Hailey. Promise me. I promise I'll be careful. [creeky door] (Becker): Just hold on a minute... please! You need to think about what you're doing here? Becker? It's Hailey Dean. I need to talk to you. Miss Dean? You need to help me. Put the wrench down and we can talk. I'm not putting it down until he does. Not until he's paid for what he's done. He's lost his mind. You need to call the police. The police are on their way. Mr. Sacks, put the gun down. I'm sorry you had to see this, Hailey. But I've gotta do what's right. Why don't you tell me what you think you know? It was all in the email that Naomi sent me. This man stole the school's money and then he stole my daughter's life! He's crazy. He's snapped! No! You snapped when you put your fingers around my daughter's neck and squeezed her last breath out! No! No, no! Look, I- I admit I'm a gambler, ok? Yes, it's a sickness. I'm sick. But I'm not a killer. Gambling is a sickness. It's no excuse! No. And Naomi left us more than enough proof to put her killer in prison. Yeah, for stealing. Not for murder. Yes, for murder. Two murders. Naomi's and Jeff Adkins. He killed Jeff, too? Why? Adkins took an envelope from Naomi's house. What was in the envelope, Becker? I don't know what you're talking about. What was in the envelope? I... Betting slips from the track. Naomi found them in my office and when the construction stopped she put two and two together. She found my online account, she found everything. And you realized after you killed her that your betting slips were no longer at the school. Then Jeff Adkins called and said he wanted to meet with you. When he showed me the betting slips I knew that he was gonna figure it out the same way Naomi did. I'm sorry... I had no choice. I'm sorry, Hailey. But he's gotta pay for what he's done. And he will. I- I need justice! Norman, just think about what you're doing, ok? You're not a killer. You're not like Becker. Naomi wouldn't want you to turn yourself into something ugly. She wouldn't want you to go to prison. That's not the life she wants for you. My wife and daughter are both gone! And the way to honour their memory is to live the best life you can. That is what they would want for you. I've gotta do something! And you will. You will testify at the trial, you will stand tall when the guilty verdict is handed down, and you will keep Naomi alive in your memory. [sobbing] [sirens approaching] So Janine Harwick has a warrant for her arrest in Texas? Yeah. She terrorized a teacher at her old school to the point of physical attack. Wow. Yeah. That's why she ran. You know, you'll be happy to hear that the DA decided not to press charges against Norman Sacks. Really? Mmmhmm. Your psychological assessment of him went a long way towards convincing him. That makes me happy. And I'm about to return the favour. This ain't the way to Chesley's. We're not going to Chesley's. Oh no, Hailey, please don't tell me you have a new problem to solve? It's an old problem, actually. I love helping people as much as you do but right now I'm hungry. That's the problem. What? You found it. You found it! There was a bug in their website. It kept defaulting to an old calendar which is why you kept going to the wrong place. How did you find it? Oh, technically I didn't. Ethan might have hacked their GPS- Ah, I don't want to know. Hi, how are you? Um, I'm gonna need six of the best burritos in Atlanta, please. That seems like a lot of burritos. I'm gonna have five, you can have one. And then, uh, I need extra sauce on everything. And cheese. Extra cheese. And cheese. Wade dumped me. Last week. He wasn't ready to be in a relationship, it had nothing to do with me. But that's not how it feels. I thought if I changed my surroundings it would help change me. What do you think needs to change? I'm stuck in a rut. Work is my life. Every time I think I've met my soulmate I'm wrong. Maybe it's not that you're wrong, maybe you just are focused on the wrong things. I don't follow. Sabrina, you need to live the life you wanna live. Be your amazing self. Get out of your comfort zone and... and salsa. Salsa lessons? Yeah. Doing things that make us uncomfortable make us better. Us? I don't wanna be the only one making a fool of my uncoordinated self on the dance floor. You'd do this with me? What are office mates for? For taking out the trash? Yes they are. Absolutely. And... salsa. As I take out the trash. Right? Salsa! Fine. I'm in, only to save you from yourself. Don't tell anyone I did this ok? Sorry I'm late. Oh, that's ok. I ordered your wine. Guess what? What? Howell Elementary isn't closing. Really? And I think it has something to do with you. What do you mean? Clyde Bennett is leasing the school back to the school board and he's funding all the repairs. Why would he do that? He said he was reminded of what someone would have wanted him to do. Have I told you how amazing you look? You clean up pretty well yourself. [laughs] You sure you're ready for this? No, but I don't want to regret not going. And I owe Clyde an apology. He turned out to be the guy I always thought he was. We're gonna have fun. You think? Even surrounded by all of Will's old friends? It might be kind of overwhelming. Oh, that's what I'm here for. To keep the whelming under control. I have your back, you know that. Thank you. Hailey. Hailey, you made it. Clyde. Hi. I owe you an apology. No, you don't owe me anything. Except maybe a dance later. You got it. Um, I don't think we've met. Oh, where are my manners? I'm sorry, this is- this is Clyde, an old friend from school, and uh, Clyde, this is Jonas, my- my boyfriend. Hi. Well, it's uh, it's great to meet you. Likewise. Listen, the party's not happening in this hallway. There are gonna be a lot of people really happy to see you. Come on. Hey, wait. What? Mmm. What was that for? Boyfriend's prerogative. Let's go ahead and have fun.
