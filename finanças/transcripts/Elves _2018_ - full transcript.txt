Derrick? Let me out, let me out! Let me out! Help, it burns! Let me out! Derrick! Help! Let me out! Derrick! Derrick! Help, let me out! Yep, always liked this time of year. - It's kinda sad, though. - Woo, look who finally - Hey, Clove. - made it to the party. What's up Clover? - Hey everybody, - Hey. - Miss Texas herself. - Oh har, har. It was rigged, never had a chance, unlike the many ladies on your list. - Ooh. - That's true, yes. - Okay, guys. - Well that really depends on the time of the night. We all know Randy likes 'em on the plus sides, huh? - True. - Yeah, yeah, only if it's your mom, by the way, let her know I called. - Ooh. - What? You two should just get a room and save the time. Yeah, only if you chaperone. - Hey, Dan. - Watch out. All you had to is ask. I was wondering when you were gonna come over here. How did you even find this creepy place? That's not important. Did you bring the party favors? Oh, you're the best. Fabulous, darling. Just, fabulous. Everyone grab a shot. Shots, c'mon, everyone. Grab a shot. Let's take a shot. Just four more days till Christmas, but we all know the true reason why we're celebrating this year. To our local hero, - the activist. - Oh, okay. - Get off the stage already. - Lifesaver. - C'mon, man, don't take the - Lovebirds. - words away from me. - Hey, watch your mouths. She saves lives. I probably left something out, but happy holidays. - To the Grinch. - To the Grinch - Grinch. - Cheers. It's a depressing time of year, guys. Hey, hey, what are you doing? - Not funny. - What? What is this? It looks like coal. It could be, yeah. I have a little Christmas game for us to play. - Oh, God. - Uh. I can't wait. It's called naughty list. - Okay. - Oh, sure. So everybody's just going to ignore the fact that I had a rock in my drink? - Shh. - You all have been naughty this year. You will write your name on the naughty list. Underneath your chair are pen, pen and paper. You will write your deepest, darkest secrets. Don't hold back. - Yeah. - What are we even doing? I pay my therapist twice a week for this, so I think I'll pass. It's a game. A dangerous one. Alright, baby doll. I like danger. Hey, really? - What? - Okay. You're all here for a reason. Yeah, we're the misfits that didn't get invited to Colin's party. - That is true. - I didn't know about - That is true. - Colin's party. Be as detailed as you can. Then add your name to the naughty list after. Be honest. The elf is watching. He doesn't like when you lie. - Dude, chill. - Relax. It's just a game, it's not serious. Um, did you do that? Who put this here? Check his hand. Hit and run, too. This isn't funny. Who put this here? Chance? This isn't a game. Once you're on the list, the only way to survive is to do what the elf says while it watches you. If you don't, you die. What are you talking about? That is not funny. It's not suppose to be. You're all on the naughty list now. Whoa, whoa, so there's a naughty list? It's not suppose to be. She's obviously joking. Guys, y'all can't be this stupid. No, this game is real. Hey, what are you talking about? I didn't have a choice. "I hate all my friends. "They don't deserve to live." Just follow the rules. Anybody else bring the booze? I think she took the last beer. Okay, okay, let's take a shot 'cause this is just too much. Are you sure you don't want company? No, I'm just ready for this to be over already. - Okay. - Well, see you later. Thanks for driving. Run! - Jesus. - Hah. Who was that guy? You're going to die tonight. Papa? You weren't supposed to be outside. C'mon. Let's go, let's go back inside. I don't get it. I can't. No. No. Hey, can I get you another drink? Sure. Alright. Two balls and two strikes. Count hangs at two and two. Well, we got two strikes... Third base coach waiting in the infield. Alright guys, who did it. - 100 pitch of the game. - Guys? And that's fouled. Two, two, runner breaks. And he fouls again. Landing a late foul to the right side. Well, they had to make home again. The hole was at second base. Kill me or I'll kill you. One on one right here. - With the two, two count. - What? Can I have that drink? Hello? Can I have that drink? Sure. Takes steps away from runners in a one-one game in the seventh inning. And not a long lead, he holds his ground... The throw to second base, not in time. And you enjoy it. Thank you. That was the one thing. Decided to go to second base for a shot at the double. I'm here at the scene of the accident where Calico Martinez has crashed her car. The vehicle, in which Jason Johnson was killed. Jason Johnson was acquitted of a hit and run only five years ago. Where did you get that? One of you obviously thought it would be funny to leave this with me at work. I bet it was Dana. You better watch yourself, rainbow. - Or? - I don't care if all these people here are watching. You haven't seen the news yet? What news? - I'm here at the scene - What's this? of the accident, where Calico Martinez has crashed... She crashed her car last night. The vehicle in which Jason Johnson was killed. - When? - I got a text right before it happened. What did it say? I don't know, I guess around eight. Where did you get this? Guys, this thing showed up yesterday about nine. This chick at the bar, she looked all elfy. She told me to spike her drink or she'd kill me, and I didn't know if she was telling the truth. So I did it, I spiked her drink. You guys, if Chance is telling the truth, Tiffany's next on the list. Come on guys. Y'all really believe this? That's not all. For those of you right now watching this broadcast, stay home. For those of you who remember the last Christmas, the holiday sequels just keep coming. Clove, are you okay? I'm fine. Well this is perfect. Now everyone in this town can lose their fucking minds all over again. But at least this is real. Oh, my God. Not this naughty list bullshit. All I know is, my friend is dead. And if I can stop anyone else from getting hurt till we figure this out, then that's what I'm gonna do. Tiff, Tiff, don't hang up. How'd you get in here? - Hello? - Tiff, Tiff, don't hang up. The game may be real. - The elf. - Wait, what? It's true all of it. If you see the elf, get out. We're coming to where you are. Just don't move, okay? Have you been naughty? Okay, I'm either really high or... Snort it. Snort it, snort it all. Tiffany? You know, this would actually work if you believe. Believe in the elf? Believe in being possessed by evil spirits? Not just possessed. She said possessed. I said the elf takes on relics such as dolls. - Bullshit. - What did you say? I said it's bullshit. According to the legend, wise men brought forth gifts on his birthday. Okay, and? And those gifts where never kept. They were used as a catalyst for the creation of the seven deadly sins. So each gift is a sin. And each gift unfulfilled. Whoever finds it will have to pay the price with their soul. You guys are fucking with me, right? Right, it's just a doll. Amy? So sorry. Merry Christmas. Am I dead? Am I dead? Not yet. I was tripping balls. There was elves and cookies. Here, we're gonna keep an eye on you. Try and stay with the living a little while longer, okay? I love you, bitch. Me too. So she tried to kill herself? Guys, I think we need to take this naughty list seriously. That stupid game? It's not just a game. Chance said we should write down why we feel we have been naughty. Cali said in her text message that she had been naughty. This sounds like that movie Truth or Dare except with Snapchat filters. No, no, no, Truth or Dare is just like that movie It Follows. Well, the majority of those movies have been made, anyway. - Yeah, no shit, Dan. - Guys? The guy she hit didn't die, and if the reports are right, it's the same guy who hit and ran Cali's little brother. Cali's brother died in that crash. I think Cali wrote Jason on the naughty list, and the game wanted her to fulfill it. That doesn't explain how it would know. I think the elf must be the key. The elf? Are you guys listening to yourselves? Our friend is dead, and we have another one recovering in the bathroom. Cali can't drive, and Tiffany obviously can't hold her blow. Oh, my God. Randy? According to my list, Leah's next. No. Monica, you stay here with Tiffany. The rest of us, come on. We're gonna go find Chance and get to the bottom of this. No, no, no. Count me out of your scavenger hunt. - Dan? - Leah, some of us have real babysitting to do. We should stay together. We'll figure it out. Have a drink, handsome. No, man, I'm good, thanks. Have a drink, handsome. Be naughty. Have a drink. Have a drink, handsome. What? Be naughty. Have a drink. Be naughty. Have a drink. Have a drink. Have a drink. Have a drink. Guys, it's my day off. Be naughty. Have a drink handsome Have a drink, be naughty. Have a drink, be naughty. Have a drink, have a drink, have a drink. - Be naughty. - No, no, no, no. - Have a drink. - No. I just wanna drug you and eat your heart out. Hey Randy, is that you? Colin? Colin, what are you doing here? I've been trying to call you to apologize. No, no, no, stay back. Look, I know you're sorry and I know I love you. But right now, I just need you to stay back. You're not making any sense. Please just stay away. Just please no. Come on now. - No, no, no. - Come on. - No, I can't. - Yes. - I won't. - Do it. No, I won't. Have you been naughty? Come on. Randy? Randy? Randy? Chance, we know you're in there. We're not leaving until you tell us what's going on. Ever since that party, our friends have been dying in weird accidents. And you vanished. What's going on? You've all been naughty. How do we stop it? Stop it? Whatever you wrote down, you have to do. You can't run. You can't hide. It doesn't go away. Leah is next on the naughty list. It can't be. What do you mean? Have you seen it? What? The elf? Yeah, the Easter bunny. Yes, yes, the elf. - Have you seen it? - No. Then you can't be next. It said right on the list. She was next after Tiffany. Randy's name has been etched out. What? If you do what you wrote down, it goes to whoever's next until they complete theirs, but it can come back to you if it didn't watch you do it. What are you talking about? The elf, it's cursed or it's not from this realm. And it was used in a wild hunt. It killed a family. We found it inside this chest and, and now it won't go away. How do you know that? I just do, okay? How do you stop it? We usually just wait until the day after Christmas and everything goes back to normal, but it's been getting worse and worse, and every year I have to write more names on the naughty list. So you knew about this? And you took us to the creepy place? I didn't have a choice. Time's running out on your option. - Now go. - Easy. I said, go. I don't wanna shoot you. Put the gun in your mouth, Chance. No. Just leave me alone. You broke the rules. It was our little secret. Remember, it must watch you do it. We need to figure out how to stop it. We must warn the others. It's about damn time. Goddammit. Boy, where you been? You sorry fuck. Goddamn, I don't bust my ass around here just so you can be late. You sorry, God. If you're gonna waste your life, why don't you do it on your own dime. You deaf? - What's up, Trevor? - What's up? You know who you're talking to? Go get me a beer, and show me some respect. Next time open it. You lazy son of a bitch. Now, you wanna hit me with the wrench? Have you been naughty? What? Hit me with the wrench, Dan. - What the? - Now. Do it. Fuck is this? - Do it. - No. - I won't do it. - Do it. You disrespecting me, boy? You disrespecting me? My house, my rules. Remember. Ungrateful, sorry motherfucker. Oh, my God. Hello, hello, hello? This is the third time I've been trying to call you. I don't where I am right now. I don't know where I am. Hello? Hello? Once you have been added to the naughty list... Let's get it. C'mon. Clover? I messed up bad. Clover? Clover? Who's there? Do you believe in the game now? Jesus, what is this? Let me go! No, let go! What is it? Are you sure about this? Leah, I don't think we have a choice. We're running out of time, and this is the last place I could think to look. I hear she hasn't had this place in years. What makes you think now that after all this time she isn't just another crazy loon? Because, I don't think, I don't think she's as crazy as we were led to believe. I want you to know that when it's my turn, I put some things on the naughty list. Okay. Let's just focus and get to the bottom of this. Okay. Clara? Is that you? We're wondering if we could ask you a few questions? Look, you crazy bitch. People are dying, and if you don't open this door now, I am gonna shove a stocking so far up your ass that you're gonna be whistling Jingle Bells through your teeth. There's nothing for you here. Please, we need your help. All of our friends are dying. I can't stop it. No one can. You have one. You have one of the elves. It was this one. I could never understand it. It's in Enochian. It's an ancient occult language. I'm not gonna ask how you know that. Well, can you translate it? I think so. They were never meant to be celebrated. Ye has brought forth his reckoning. This celebration was created to shield us from the truth. Christ's birthday? That's the reason we celebrate. No. We celebrate his survival. The biblical Magi. They're also referred as the Three Wise Men or Three Kings. They were in the Gospel of Matthew or traditional Christian ideals. There's a group of distinguished foreigners that visited Jesus after his birth bearing gifts. I don't know, the Gospel of Matthew was the only one out of the four chronicled gospels to mention the Magi. See, Matthew reports that they came from the east to worship the King of the Jews. The gospel never mentions the number of Magi. But the Western Christian denominations, they just traditionally assumed them to be three. The Three Wise Men, yes. What does this have to do with the elf? Only a number because of the statement that they brought three gifts. But the Enochian translation it was seven. Psalm 72, chapter 11. May all kings fall down before him. Why seven? Pride. Greed. Lust, envy. Gluttony, wrath. Sloth, all of 'em major sins, but also virtues. You mean that there's seven of these things? These elves? Just two. The holiday rebirth? It could be under the influence of wrath, yeah. You have to find the gateway, the realm. The chest. You have to close the lord to this world. The naughty list. What about you? Leah? What else do you have? - I said... - What? I said the... - Sloth. - Holy, shit. She's only 20 years old. She's 20 years old. We have come together to celebrate and uplift each other during the most wonderful time of the year. My kids, they haven't spoken to me in years. I feel like I'm always playing the same guy in every movie. It's, it's as if there's nobody else over 42 that can be cast, you know? Same, what doesn't kill you make you stronger. My kids, each holiday, all I get is a card and a text message. A text message? Might as well put me out to pasture with the rest of the cows. Look at you. No, seriously. Anybody that says they love Christmas has not been to Marvin's room. I discovered this group because I had a really hard time getting my kids to put their phones away. Like, can't we just be a family? It's not all about toys and gifts, and I felt like that's what society has turned Christmas into. Right. Yeah. And this year the kids decided to go with my ex-husband and his new wife. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in this shit hole. Santa's Helpers is about more than coping with the pain of hating this time of year. Santa's Helpers is about showing you a new path. A better path towards enjoying the holidays. Excuse me. What a great way to ring in the holiday season. Can we help you? This is a private gathering. If you want to sign up, if you want to be involved... I have a secret of my own. A secret Santa. And I just can't seem to figure out who it is. Someone in here just might be it. Oh, yes. See, my little friend and I hate people who don't absolutely love Christmas. Went to track down Chance. Stay put. Call if you need anything. You are part of a wild hunt. Once you have been added to the naughty list, then what? You must die. Who's there? I already called the cops. You have to leave before they get here. Hello? Hey? We're closed. You are part of a wild hunt. It was real this whole time. John is dead. Everyone on the list. Everyone is scratched off. Clover, it's Christmas. My God, we have to find the chest. Just the people I was looking for. Let's not do that. What do you say? Did we find the list? Yes. I'm taking you somewhere special. I mean, it's Christmas after all. Drive. What are we doing here? This would go a lot faster if you let me do the talking. The naughty list triggered a wild hunt, and you two are gonna help me stop it. No one can stop it once it starts. Look, we're running out of time. If you don't let us go, we're gonna have to do what we put on the list. And the elf could appear at any moment. Oh, I'm countin' on it. Get closer to the chest. That's right, keep your hands in front of you. Who are you? What a wonderful night to be naughty. Leah? Woo. Let's speed this party up a bit. Fucking kill you. Shit. Clover. C'mon, c'mon. We need to put the elf in the chest. The naughty list. Oh no, oh no. It's time. No. No. Take this gun and kill the holiday rebirth. No, I don't know what you're talking about. Clover? Clover? Oh, my God. There truly is no other time of year like this. It, it, it was you? No, no. Yes. I understand. Subtitles by explosiveskull
