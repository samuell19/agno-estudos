FLOOD Alright. A few words on wages. We have a bonus system... Every month there's a sales target, if you hit 80%, wages rise for the whole team. So you can push the team and motivate the others. One person slowing the whole team down just isn't fair, right? Are you lazy or are you one of us? Next stop, Landungsbrücken. Change here for S1, S3, and the harbor ferries. Hey, how are you? - How's it going? - Look around... We can bring one book to the exams. So I need to know everything. - One, two... - Thanks. I know a guy there, he's DJ'ing on the beach. Vietnam too? -Don't know. My plan is not to have a plan. Vacation would be nice... Maybe you can take a week off. - Sounds good. - Shall we? Hey, how are you? What is it? - That's the guy who fired me! - Wanker. - I'll dance with him later. - He's all yours. - Are you applying for jobs now? - Of course. You didn't tell her, did you? The exams are killing her, I better wait. - I'll tell her in two weeks. - Two weeks? - I have no choice. - You're an idiot. You can just tell her. - Hi. - How are you? - How's it going? - Fine. - And, how are things? - Quite good actually. Nice -We're preparing to expand outside of Germany... - And what are you up to? - I have a few ideas. Not in a startup? - I wanted to surprise you! - What are you... Katharina... You made it! It's his last evening. I'm getting a beer. - Have fun, and take care! - I will. Wait, I forgot my jacket... Take care. - Don't know. - What's wrong? I have a FEELING... it's like... Sorry... can't control it... I ate some nuts today and I think, now I'm going nuts myself. Would you please move your bottom out of the way... We are grown ups, there's really no need for tomfoolery at night! - Stop it. - What do you mean? - I better sleep in the living room. - Aren't you a lawyer, madam? I'm in need of legal aid. I skinned 13 people. But it was self-defense. Is there something you can do? - That'll be quite expensive. - No problem. The 13 people where quite wealthy. Then we can figure something out. - You're also very attractive. - Thank you. And you have wonderful skin. It would suit me well. As a negligee. Yes. I can't sleep. I didn't realize. You're distracting me. I'm just sleeping, at least I tried. Me too. I love you. Bye. Bye. Fuck. Sorry. - It's useless. -No, it's not. - It's too much. I feel sick. - There is nothing to laugh about. - Oh my god. They're cool. - Don't you like them? - Did you pick them yourself? Not bad. How much where they? None of your business. I made an investment. In myself. Honey, are you stressed? - So... you're heading back later? - I think so. Well... Melissa. Jonas. - And? And? And? - I made it! Thank god, I'm glad. Congratulations! - We don't know the results yet. - I do! - So, you're free now! - Yes! Any plans? - Laze about! Do nothing! No... - Exactly, yes! - How was your day? - I thought about you, mostly. Crossed all my fingers. - Still no hint on what we're doing? - Nope. Not bad. Come on. Wait, wait! Close you eyes. There's a step. Open your eyes. Awesome, right? Luckily, we're not that tall. Good for us. I'm tired. Hey honey, you're not picking up, so... Don't be surprised, I'm not home... Grandma died. Mom isn't so well, I need to be there for her, so... okay... Bye-bye. Mom, we've got that. - Can we please go. - Now? - I can't stand it any longer. - Ok, but go in one more time. I don't want to. You can't walk in there and say 'Mom, I'm off now'. Just for a bit. - I'll clean up here. - Thank you. Call me crazy, but I really feel like partying. Not tonight. And I'm very glad to have found a perfect replacement. He studied at the Business School of Europe... and is the founder and CEO of Foodiyo, a premium delivery service. He is Germany's latest hot thing... Marc Maschke is with us! Thank you. I'm Marc and I'm the hot thing. Ten thousand people are out there, having ideas. But you need to realize those ideas. One of you will become a successfull entrepeneur, just one. Do you know why? The others are afraid. You want to take trodden paths, have something on your CV... But you need to overcome your fears. 'I believe in my idea. I just do what I want.' - What're you doing here? - I'm waiting for you... Ok... I think, I owe you an explanation. Yeah? Well, then... The woman in the club... That's over. - You don't need to explain. - But I want to. And I'd like to see you. I'll come over. - I thought I'd buy you dinner. - I'll come over. - I text you when and where. - All right. See you later. - You're finished, right? - Yes, thank you. Guess who gave a lecture at Uni today... - No idea. - Marc gave it. - He didn't mention. - A really cool talk. Yeah, next week, we'll do one together. Next week? I thought, he's going to Dubai... -Right. I didn't want to join. I thought, 'Let him do it.' - How long is he away again? - Like ten days... shouldn't you know? Ten days in Dubai. Good for him. Are you trying every single spaghetti? - Just checking. - See, not done. I'd eat them now. Wanna try? You sure? Ok, we wait! Are you coming tonight? Not in the mood? Come on... Law students, exam time... I know what the evening will be like. - You can bring one of you colleagues. - I see them way too much. - I don't want to go, if you're like that... - Why? I'm... look. Just once I want to... - I don't want to take a grouch with me. - I have... - I'm sorry, I screwed up already. - No problem. - So, I come in. - Come in. Thank you. Come in. - Wine? -Yes, thank you. - I don't have red. I don't drink red wine anyway, because... - Because? - I can't stomach it. Thank you. - Nice to have you. - Thanks for the invitation. There's also cheese. I can hide it. No. You look a bit uncomfortable... But I can't offer you a seat in your own flat... Let's go outside. It's comfortable there. But I take the olives. - You need bars or a grill. - Why? - So you don't fall over drunk. - Nonsense. Yes! Now you're showing off. Also Italian, by the way. - I had a meeting with an Albanian today. - Really? But I forgot how they say 'cheers'. I thought it's a deal and we fly to Chicago tomorrow! We can go, if you want. - That would be cool. - Yeah. We were at skiing camp, playing the pretzel stick game... - You're making fun of me already! - No, go on... - I'm not telling you. - Please. If you prove yourself, I'll tell you later. You'll become a teacher one day! I'm getting educated? - And how do I prove myself? - Not by turning your back. I just... turned a bit. Cheers. All at once? Of course. Sorry! I couldn't! - What's wrong? - What is that?! - What did you put in?! - You ordered it. Cheese? - You're a bit cheeky today. - I think, I'm drunk. After 2 glasses! - I feel bad now. - Don't worry. But it was really disgusting. But... - But? - Nothing. - Wait a second. Sorry, sorry... - What's wrong? I don't know. No no no, don't take my glass... - Just relax. - Watch out, watch out... I can't, ok, nononono, wait... Let me... let me go! Let me go! - It's all fine. - Just let me pass, please. - Can you please tell me... - No, no... - Please tell me... - Just let me go, ok? - Tell me what's... - And give me me my shoe! - Give me the shoe or I'll go without it. - What's going on? Melissa. Leave me alone, please. Just let me... I'm not doing anything! - What's wrong? - I can't say. I have to go now. Let me go! Don't you get it?! What're you doing here? What do you want?! What the fuck?! - What where you doing in my flat? - I didn't do anything. Did you steal something? Don't you have a home?! What did you do in my flat?! How did you even get in? - Because you fired me... - Shut your fucking mouth. - So, why don't you have a job? - You fired me. So I thought... - And why did I fire you? -Cause you're an asshole! - Because you're a fucking loser. - Want me to call the cops? - Please don't. - I report you. - No. I didn't steal anything. I needed a place to stay. Shut your fucking mouth. Fuck off! Did you break your phone? I'm sorry. I don't know... - Where were you? - Everywhere. I walked around all night. Yeah, me too... I walked around the flat all night! I thought something happened to you! I called a thousand times... Nothing! You have a mouth to speak! I don't matter to you anyway. I just needed to be alone. Were you? Were you really alone? Yes, I was. North sea crabs... What do they have? That's a lot of onions. Super delicious. Fährmann. Wennmann, hello. You applied for a position... - That's a surprise! - Have you seen Jonas? Today? I thought we'd share our break. And then...? And then, I wanted to hand him a coffee. Do you know, where he is? He... hasn't been in today... I sent him to Bremen. I see. It's all fine. He's checking out a few new restaurants. I guess, he'll head straight home tonight. - I see... - You wanted to surprise him at work? Yes, I always wanted to... - Bad luck. - Indeed. You even bought him a coffee. - Would you like one? - Actually, I would. Thank you! What a bummer. Well, I'm off then. - Of course. -Enjoy the coffee! - Thank you! -Bye She has no time for a dog. Dogs are like babies, they need you 24/7. And next summer, we become a cat hotel? - No way. -Come on! - Nope. - A sweet Persian, with fluffy hair! - No way. I came by the office today. Thought, I'd surprise you, but you weren't in. I wasn't. Well, sorry. I was out. No problem. Watch out. Me again! Hey! Wow, beautiful. I was just around the corner, so I thought, I'd pop by! Do I get a tour? Bedroom. Sorry, I'm a bit... Nice and tidy. One could eat off the floor. Here's the living room. Nice. - We just made salad... - Great. Say, how was Bremen? - All fine. - Went well? What did they say? - It's looking well. - Looking well? They said? In Bremen? - Well, Cheers! - I just fix you a plate... With lots of cheese. Nice. Would they suit me? A bit wide. Whatever works. I keep mine. Great couch. And now some TV! Say, what are they up to in Bremen? I heard about two burger joints, a pizza place, and some vegan...? - All on board. - Sometimes, he's a bit slow... Hired with big hopes, but now I'm thinking... Jonas, you're losing it. So get yourself together. Just kidding. He's my number one! Beautiful. - Now I know the place, right? - Yes. - Bye. - Yes, bye. See you tomorrow! Claasen. Mr Wennmann. Have a seat. Thank you. Of course, we're here to see if you are a good fit for us... Let's dive in... Who are you? Where're you headed? Why does Jonas even have a phone?! - I'm back! How are you?! - Awesome! Dinner's at my place tonight. At eight. No excuses. Everything ok? No. Do you need to tell me something? No. What's that? Your savings book. Did you close the account? - You're such an asshole. - Why? What is it? You can tell me. - You lie straight to my face? - I don't know what you want. Where's the money from my account? How should I know? - I'm serious. - Me too. Where are my savings? No idea. Well, not here. - But I didn't touch it. - Me neither. Why would you think that I took it? Did you call the bank? - Look, listen... - Don't touch me! Look... What? You're a cheap liar. No! - Can you please stop it? - Stop touching me! - But I like touching you. - Let me go! - I made it! - Stop the bullshit. I planned it as a surprise... I know that you lost your job. For you. - I went to... - Please, stop. Why don't you talk to me? Why didn't you say anything? I need to go to the bathroom. Come on, take a shot... Be brave for once... Come on! Nice one. Bulls-eye! Well, you do look handsome today. Can I have a quick look? Come here... let me see. It's mine, isn't it? That's mine. My jacket, my trousers. Take them off. Take them off! And the trousers? Those are my trousers.
