My last project was "Summer Love". I really regret. Loving him with all my heart. How can it be love. If you don't love with all your heart? Do you have any idea how hard it was for us to meet? How easy do you think it is. for one rain drop to meet another? Even if two rain drops embrace. they will simply vanish. when they hit the ground. I played dual roles. Amazing. What about you? What was your last project? Me? I was in "My Love from Space". For real? If a meteor is about to collide with Earth, would you want me to be. the one by your side at the very end? I would. I'm so happy. I heard the producer at today's audition is very mean. A lot of people came out crying. No way. Next, Shangduan DiDi. Good luck. Stay strong. - You can see the script, right? - Yes.

Celebrities filming outdoors always attract bystanders. Fainting on the street attracts bystanders too. Let's go. I always get free dishes. You think I won't be full? Seeing you enjoying it makes me happy too. I do enjoy it. I came all the way from Sector 49. That's really far. Don't they have noodle bars there? They do, but there's no restaurant in space. with noodles as tasty as yours. or has such as beautiful... Design. Thank you. What do you do on Sector 49? I mainly collect interstellar trash. Sometimes I also help clean spacecraft. In short, I'm a janitor. What's wrong with being a janitor? It's just that I'm still young. I need to find a job where I can learn. so I can have a future. I'm recruiting new staff. If you're interested, I can hire you immediately. Really? I'm just a stranger yet you're so good to me. Sometimes, the words or actions of a stranger could change a person's life. Shangguan DiDi is also currently facing a stranger. But this is no ordinary stranger. He is about to say something. that will change Shangguan DiDi's life. I'm about to die? Your tumor is already terminal Average life expectancy is less than a year. DiDi! DiDi! Get up!

I'm about to die. Cut it out. I won't let you die. What do we do? DiDi, don't let go. I'll never let go. Don't you worry. Forgot again! For years, I ws just my sister's little sidekick. I watched as she shone brighter and brighter And so I wanted to be just like her. - She's so annoying. - Bet she's had plasitc surgery. Yeah, she must have. She must have had plastic surgery? No amount of surgery can save your ugly faces. - Lunatic. - Wait. Give it to me. Why not? I just need a few of introductions and a couple of small roles. Why can't you do it? The industry has its own rules. I can't break my rules just because of you. Your rules. You're the one who gets paid to dine with people. What are you talking about? Aren't company bigwigs lining up to dine with you? What did you say? Is it not true? I dare you to say it again. I can say it 3 more times if you want. You dine with people for money. The whole world can try to smear me You're my sister... If Mom hadn't told me to look after you I wouldn't have to put up with such a loser. I've put up with you for 12 years. I'm a loser? OK. I'll move out right now. I want nothing to do with you! Go ahead. If you leave now then don't ever come back. Even if I starve to death or get sick, I'll never ask anything of you ever again.

Applause rang out amid the cheers The tears have gushed into my smile. The show is entertainment in your eyes When the curtain drops loneliness is all mine How many hardships and tears Before I can stand here? The pain of failure The encouragement of success Who knows how many years I have toiled? Clown Clown Her misery is turned into joy For you Cut! Cut! Is she nuts? She's really going all out. Shangguan DiDi, good work. Thanks. I have a friend who's filming something interesting. I'll recommend you. Thank you, Director. Keep at it. OK. I hear you're interesting and hardworking. Thank you. It's like this. I'm making a short video about animals. Animals? DiDi is an expert at imitating animals. Check this out. Groundhog. Monkey Camel Aligator We saw an alligator just like that last time. Ok, I get it. You're pretty good. But this time we're not making you ugly. Not ugly? Foie gras for the appetizer. Foie gras? And then the beer cold soup. Beer.. Cold...cold soup? For the main I'll have the beef shank. The cow's shank? Thank you. Your meal will be with you soon. Do you know how expensive this place is? My darling, Can we not eat the foie gras? Why don't you eat my liver? My shank will do too. I've made some money lately. You haven't made that much. Let's just enjoy life, OK? Have you had that space noodle dream I told you about? How could 2 people possibly have the same dream? Of course it's possible. When I was little, my mom said dreams are like wings. They always come in pairs. If you have a dream, there will be someone else on the world who has the exact same dream as you. What your mom said isn't necessarily true. She also said if someone else really has your dream then he is the one you've always been waiting for. I'm the one you've always been waiting for. The moon has melted, dropping onto my face Drowning my sorrows, somewhat The ones who dream The ones who hurt The cat of life enters the dreamland smiling foolishly You've arrived, wet with starlight Toward the eternal water, you gaze Telling me a lie Ma'am, more soup please. Are you the only one who can touch this pot of soup? During my great great great grandpa's generation. someone stole half a pot of this soup and made a fortune from their own noodle shop. That amazing, huh? DiDi. What happened to you? Here is your appetizer. Foie gras. I finally get to eat foie gras. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. Foie gras. Nice? (I will always be by your side.) - What's so funny? - This is so hilarious. What are you laughing at? 1 2 3 4 Hong Li Yu Yu Lu Li Yu Yu Lu Hong Li Yu Yu Lu Li Yu Yu Lu Ten, hundres, thousand... hundred thousand... ten thousand... hundred thousand... 1.5 million And it's only been online for 5 hours. - I'm famous! - All right! Be carefull. I'm an overnight sensation! Piggyback! Spin around! I'm an overnight sensation! I'm going get a big head! I'm gonna be a diva! Phone call. Wait, ouch. Hello? Is this Ms Shangguan DiDi? I am. I'm from the program "Atypical Interview". We'd like to invite you on our show for a live chat. Oh...OK... Can I pass you on to my agent? "Atypical Interview" wants to interview me. "Atypical Interview"! Talk to him. I can't take this. I am not an agent. I've never been an agent. What do I say? Hi, I'm Shangguan DiDi's agent. Any special requests for today's hair and makeup? No. Anything is fine. Thank you. Miss Shangguan. I'm the host, Wang Tientien. Nice to meet you. The producer said it's your first interview program It's actually my first interview ever. Don't be nervous. Think of it as having a chat. You're a new talent. I won't be hard on you. There's a question I will ask later. What's the situation between you and Shangguan LingLing? Think about how you want to answer that. Welcome to "Atypical Interview". Sitting beside me now is the woman who recently shot to fame due to a 1-minute video, Shangguan DiDi. Hi everyone, my name is Shangguan DiDi. Let me ask you a question. Is Shangguan DiDi your real name? Yes. So Shangguan LingLing is your...? My big sister Both sisters are in the entertainment industry. but your path to fame have been quite different. You can be frank about it. Shangguan LingLing is a superstar. I won't even have the chance to play her servant. But I remember my sister once said, Every line of work has its own rules. You must rely on your own efforts to be worthy of the opportunities you receive. Shangguan LingLing sounds very strict. But you did it. You got here on your own merits. My sister also said, Work hard, or you're just wasting everybody's time. Is there anything you want to tell your sister? I used to love peanut butter when I was little. so my mom invented" peanut butter noodles" for me and my sister. The flavor was really special, salty and sweet. It felt like we could taste both Mom's smile and tears. After Mom passed, I tried making it a few times. but it tasted really bad. It was the same when my boyfriend made it. Sis, do you remember how to make it? Is what I said OK? It was great. Your response was very unique. Hello? Is this Ms Shangguan LingLing? Who's calling? I'm a reporter from Swirl Weekly. I have a few questions for Ms Shangguan. What questions? What's your relationship with the laywer Mr Fang? We're just friends. The photos suggest you're more than just friends. Ms Shangguan, do you know Mr Fang is married? I'm busy now. Sorry. All the A-list actresses right now. are fighting to be in your film. but the role they all want is Shangguan LingLing's. So I don't think we have to match Shangguan LingLing with another A-list actress. What do you think? Madam, you may like to stir up trouble. but if you can toss it in the pot, I can make the dish. Look further out. Look out the window. Hello? Did they do a good job? Did I look like a superstar? What's wrong? Have you heard of Andell Film Company? Yeah, they're erally famous. They want you to be in their movie. Look. So so so many people wanted to be in our movie. but in the end we chose...you. Thanks, but I've really never been in a movie before. It's just a movie. Just dreams on a screen. Don't worry, just pretend it's a dream. Could you be you that...Xia... I am Xia Wuji. Yes! Director Xia Wuji. You're a super famous big shot! Director, I saw in the news that you want Shangguan LingLing to be in your film. It's like this. We're planning an imperial palace movie in which both you and Shangguan LingLing play princesses. Does Shangguan LingLing know you want me for the film? To cast you we only need the Master's and your consent. What, do you need Shangguan LingLing's permission? OK, I'll do it. Now you're suddenly become a mistress. Don't call me that. How could I know he has a wife in America? I've had enough. Maybe if we come forward and explain. Explain? At this point who will believe you? Might as well hire a monk to pray for you. Listen. You're got a scandal now. Take a look outside. There are plenty of vultures awaiting your fresh. The idea I have right now is to throw a new piece of meat out there to divert their attention. What new meat do I have? Shangguan DiDi. What do you mean? I finally convinced Shangguan DiDi to star with you in the movie. This way, we'll have a new topic to hype up. I'm not using my sister for publicity. I'm trying to think of an idea for your sake. Thanks for your idea. but I hate nothing more than these underhand tactics. LingLing, don't be so negative. Negative? If you all think I'm hurting the movie. then I might as well just drop out. LingLing. What, you're not going to honor it? Besides, you really want to snub Master Xia like that? You're a celebrity now. Why are you still coming here for facials? Don't celebrities go to those high-class places? It's not like this place is low class. OK, leave the mask on for 15 minutes. OK. Hello? I watched your interview. You looked great, very pretty. I know you've agreed to star in our film, So you're calling to congratulate me? I'm calling to ask you to drop out. Drop out? Why? You haven't called me for 3 years. I finally get a call from you and it's like this. If you join, they'll say I'm trying to stir up publicity again. I know it's not fair to ask this of you. I'm in a really bad situation right now. But if you agree to back out of this movie. I will use all my available resources - to get you a lead role in another film. - I don't want your help. What do you take me for? I'm not your pet Pug. You keep saying I need to rely on meself. Now I have, and you say you're compromising. Damn it, what planet are you from? Please, I've already conceded so much. Can't you just cooperate? I don't need you to concede. I don't want to cooperate either. I'm not backing down. Nothing's going to stop me. Lunatic. I'm currently reporting from Andeli Film Company. Shangguan LingLing and Shangguan DiDi's new film officially commences pre-production today. The company announce that in the coming 2 months. all the new s concerning these 2 actresses. will be shared with their adoring fans. (Shangguan DiDi) Have you met with Shangguan LingLing yet? Not yet. No, we're just going along with the studio's plans. If you see her, what's the first thing you want to say? Have you been in contact with your sister recently? Let's go. At the end of the day, I just want to put in a powerful performance Plus I believe the film is going to be a masterpiece. Any other questions? LingLing. According to an online poll, Shangguan DiDi Do you think your popularity has fallen because you accidentally got involved in someone else's marriage recently? Are you worried your sister will outshine you? She's just a comedian. What do you think? seems Shangguan Ling-ling looks down on her sister I'm guessing that maybe she's purposely fueling the fires of a sister rivalry. to take the focus away from her affair scandal. But would her little sister be willing to be used by her like that? Keep low. OK. - Keep going straight. - Don't scare me. Stop! Take off the mask. Voila! What's going on? Cha-ching! This is my favorite scooter! Yeah! Whose is it? - Yours. - Mine? Mine? Thank you. Take me away. Where? Hollywood. I'm going to Hollywood! Move oveR, Mery Streep. I better start preparing my award acceptance speeches. Audiences, can you believe it? The film has been under preparartion for nearly 2 months but these 2 sisters have not yet come face to face. this film will officially begin shooting tomorrow. When they finally meet will the sisters create sparks. or cause an explosion? We shall wait and see. The movie is really about to start. I just hope I can successfully finish the whole film. No matter what you do, I'll always be right beside you. I have to persist to the very end. I really didn't get it before. I used to take everything for granted Only now do I realize that being able to wake up and breathe. and even taking a shit is so precious. Being in your arms every day is so precious. Just make sure you look after yourself. Don't push yourself too much. You're already the greatest girl in the universe to me. I'm not the greatest. Not even close. Please. You gave me a new scooter! So giving you a scooter makes me the greatest. You have to promise me. After I die, you won't let another girl ride on it. What about... my mother? Stop yapping and just promise me. OK. Pinky swear. Take it seriously! Pinky. Thumb. Open up your hand, twist around, OK. Promise me you won't cry at my funeral. Xiao-gua, pay attention later. Shangguan DiDi must be standing outside already before we leave the room Why? You want LingLing to wait for Shangguan DiDi? This isn't your first day on the job! Actually, I don't even want to go out. There are so many reporters outside. You're going to see your sister soon. Nervous? You? You nervous? Of course. It's the first time I'm meeting her. Why are you nervous for? She's not your sister. She's your sister. She's not my sister. She's just a stupic actress called Shangguan LingLing. Shangguan LingLing is your sister. So what if she's my sister? She's the one who looked down on me. She's the one who kicked me out. She's the one who should be nervous. I'm not afraid of her. As soon as I see her, I'm gonna... It's time. Thank you to all our friends in the media. Thanks fo rall the support you've shown for our film. First, allow me to introduce beside me, the director of this film, Master Xia. Next, our two leading ladies of the film, sharing the stage for the very first time today. Please welcome Shangguan DiDi! Please say a few words. Hi everyone, my name is Shangguan DiDi. From today, I will prove to everyone that even comedians know how to act. Thank you. Excellent. Next, please allow me to introduce our other lead actress, Shangguan LingLing. Greetings, everybody. I'm Shangguan LingLing. I'm very honored today to be able to work with my sister Shangguan DiDi. Thanks to all the love and support for us sisters. I'm sure in the coming days we will be able to make sparks fly. OK, now it's photo op time. Please leave some space for our two leads. Come. A bit closer. Closer. Make sparks fly? More like make farts fly. If you want to be a star. I'd advise you to be more mature. As long as you don't create more stupid scandals. I really don't want to argue with you. Don't you worry about me. Ready. Sound. Speed. Camera. Set. Scene 43. Shot 1. Take 1. Action! No one can stop me if I want to come here. Unfortunately, I cannot grant your request... Just plead with Father to allow me to return. Why won't you do it? You chose the outside world back then. as you didn't want to be bound by palace life. It's your own fault you can't come back now. You... We've been sisters for 20 years. and yet you won't even help me. No relationship can override Father's decrees. If you have what it takes, you should rely on yourself to win Father's trust. The palace still has to abide by palace rules. The industry has its own rules. I can't break my rules just because of you. You're the one who gets paid to dine with people. Again with the rules? You just won't shup up about your rules! In short, I can't help you. Please go. You can't help or won't help? You've always looked down on me, mistrusted me. You say I'm just a comedian. What's wrong with being a comedian? Is it shameful? Cut! Let's change up the lighting. What the hell are you doing? Don't you know we're filming right now? So what if we're filming? You're the only one who can be in movies, right? You're the greatest, OK? Are you trying to mess everything up again? Trying to blame me again. I never relied on you. You have no right to lecture me! No right? I practically raised you! Please. We haven't seen each other in centuries. Who did you raise? Did you purposely come to ruin things for me? I told you not to do this film but you just had to Now the whole world's lauging at us. Happy? I'm glad that I'm a comedian. Isn't my specialty to make people laugh? Reporters, make sure you get all this down! Headline: ShangguanLingLing bullies comedian sister. DiDi, that's enough. Shangguan DiDi, are you ill? Who did you say is ill? She really is ill. Both of you are ill. You have a troublesome brain tumor. You'll have memory loss from time to time. Don't you ever come back. Why do I have to put up with such a loser? Move aside, please let us through. Shangguan DiDi. Doctor, please tell me what's happened to my sister. About 6 months ago, Shangguan DiDi underwent a health check. We found a tumor in her brain. There is currently no cure. Plus Miss Shangguan's cancer is terminal. Terminal. a terminal patient's lifespan won't exceed 1 year. Half a year if she's lucky. Aren't you her older sister? How come yo didn't know about her condition? I'll help DiDi find a caretaker. someone who can look after her 24/7. Caretaker? DiDi's still has a film to make. Forget about the film, she's in no condition to work. It's precisely because she knows she's dying. That's why she's working so hard, trying to prove herself. Prove herself for whom? She never said it herself, but I could sense it. Everything she did, she did to prove to you. that she could make it on her own. Throughout this period, I've staved by her side, letting her do what she wants to do. I suddenly realized, that the only thing she wants to do is to prove that she's not a loser. (I had no choice. Forgive me.) My treat. Let's drink to death. Will there be a tomorrow? No. Will there be a tomorrow? No. You're awake. Come. How are you feeling? What happened? You fainted. Fainted? Weren't we filming? You were probably too tired. But I don't want to stay in hospital. Can you take me home? The doctor will check up on you tomorrow morning. If there are no issues we can go home then. But... I can't remember anything. And I still feel really dizzy. Plus... I'm really hungry. I prepared food. Hang on. Wait. Here, peanut butter noodles. You don't know how to make peanut butter noodles. I don't want this. Go buy some bread. I tested a new recipe this time. Try it. How is it? This... Nice? It tastes just like how my mom sued to make it. We're here. Take it easy. Why aren't you getting off? I'll go buy something. How's that possible? How did you...? Actually, I didn't make these noodles. It was your sister, Shangguan LingLing. DiDi, your sister will still make those noodles you really like. Ling-Ling, DiDi can indeed by naughtly sometimes. but don't always get angry at her. Mom is tried. I need a good sleep. You came all the way here to help me clean up? How did we get like this? Why didn't you tell me you're sick? Didn't we agree to always make up no matter what? We're sisters. Do you know how angry at you I am? But... I also...really miss you. I'm sorry. After Mom died, I don't know why I thought of myself as her. I became so unhappy. Can you please forgive me? Sis! I haven't call you "Sis" for so long. If there is something you want to do we'll go accomplish it together. I want... I want to finish the movie. Can your body handle it? I can do it. why you have to finish the movie? Because... I don't have much time left. I want to finish this one thing properly. Whatever you want to do. I'll be here by your side. Thank you. Why did you show up so late? You show up so late. You show up so late. If someone asks you later, just give me a call. OK, Miss. Exquisite... I never got a good look at this set before. That's because we were too busy fighting. Come. I'll wait for you outside. You have to pretend to be the director! Director? Test. Scene 43. Shot 1. Take 2. Action! This is the inner court of the palace. It is no longer your home. No one can stop me if I want to come here. Unfortunately, I cannot grant your request. Why not? You chose the outside world back then. as you didn't want to be bound by palace life. It's your own fault you can't come back now. We've been sisters for 20 years. and yet you won't even help me. No relationship can override Father's decrees. If you have what it takes, you should rely on yourself to win Father's trust. The palace still has to abide by palace rules. Fine, I understand. All this time I've been wandering alone outside. when I'm alone at night, I'd always think about what you once told me. After all these years, I finally understand the meaning This is the jade hairpin you gave me as a child. It's always been the most important thing to me. After I leave this time if I never come back I hope... you will remember... that I was once your sister Sis. Goodbye. Cut! I did it. Hello? Miss. studio security is here. I have to take care of this. Are you OK? You should go too. What for? Help my sister out. OK, wait here. I'll be right back. Button. There's something I've never told you. And that is... I actually really hate riding on scooters. What I like is that felling of knowing that no matter where I want to go. as long as I hold on to you. you will go there with me. I know I will always be in your heart. And then. you will always be with me, protecting me. That way you'll never be able to get rid of me. Sis. After Mom passed, I should have been by your side. In the end, I'm leaving you too. Sis, I really wanted to be as awesome as you. Unfortunately, I couldn't get there. Have I finally improved, Sis? Shop owner Xu Chunmei. I can't keep supplying you with my dream for you to fall in love. I hope you can find true love in someone else's dream. Enjoy my share of happiness along with yours. Thank you all for coming to farewell DiDi. Family is gift from God. We laughed and cried together when we were little but I don't know why. After we grew up, we had to torment each other. I so wish DiDi was just playing a joke on me. I so wish she could come back to me. be affectionate with me, be cheeky with me. I so wish this time I could stubbornly not let her go. DiDi. I love you so much. You are the most precious gift of my life. Promise me. You won't cry at my funeral. Chunmei. Chunmei. Sis. I'm not your sister. I'm Shangguan DiDi's sister. Am I dead? Nope. You just haven't woken up. I'm still dreaming right now? Yeah, but it's about time you woke up. DiDi kept thinking she was dreaming of me. but it was actually me who was dreaming of her. You dreamed of her. She was dreaming in your dream. So you're here to wake me up. I'm here to tell you to live a good life. DiDi's life and mine are both just dreams. but your life is real. You have to keep living. I drank way too much last night. My head is killing me. Me too. What's that? They're here to maintain our facilities. Our park facilities are getting really old. No. 49. No. 49. No. 49. What No. 49? No.49! You thief! Scumbag! Give it back to me! Where did you hide it? It must be here. 51. I drank too much last night. Sorry. Sorry, I got the wrong person. Why didn't yo say something earlier? Here, I'll give you a hand. Say something. Say, " How come you're 20 minutes late again?" How...come you Louder! How come you're 20 minutes late again? 20 minutes late every time. 10 days means 200 minutes late. Let me see your face. Show me. Button. How's that possible? Button? How's that possible? I drank too much last night. Sorry. Sorry... How's that possible? Button doesn't exist in the real world. I know who Button is. I've been having a dream. In that dream, my name is Button. You're in my dream too. In my dream, your name is...Shang... No. Your name is ... Suma Shangguan! Some dreams make us sad. Some dreams make us heal. Some galaxies are very far away. Some galaxies are in our hearts.
