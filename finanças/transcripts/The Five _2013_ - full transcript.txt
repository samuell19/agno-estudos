Blood type Rh-O, no allergies to drugs. Something wrong? That's a rare blood type. We got enough units? Enough for the surgery, but since it's rare, so we've requested more. Is her family notified? Husband and daughter died on the scene, and she turns out to be an orphan. Defibrillator ready. Give me 50. Charge, shoot! Another, 80! - Charge! - Shoot! Her pulse's back. About her family, it might complicate things later on. Look into it again. Yes, doctor. There's scribbles on them. Friends gave it to me. For a new semester. Meal time, go wash your hands.

She's the only witness, can she recover? Although the patient is... not suffering from locked-in syndrome. She doesn't respond to light, and so do her nerves. Will she be in a vegetative state, or go brain dead? In my professional opinion, Mrs. KO is... already brain dead. We'll now accept questions concerning this case. Yes? Is it true that no DNA or fingerprints were recovered? That is true at this point in the investigation, but we are doing everything we can. Mrs. KO, I know you can hear me. You'll give my daughter a 2nd chance. I am truly sorry. Forgive me, and rest in peace. 2 years later God is always watching us. We lived happily with God, as indicated with this line.

As you say, if this fuck's kidnapping runaways, there should be other similar reports, but there hasn't been any. We're not eating donuts and taking naps here. We're doing... - everything possible, so... - So please be patient. This is nuts... Chinese Food Menu Take care of it. We cannot put all our resources on 1 case. We're doing... - everything possible, so... - So please be patient. You should come live with me. This place'll be demolished, you can't even get mail. Please consider it, sister.

I'm quite selfish. Nasty, isn't it? I had breast cancer. It's recurring though. They gave me 3 months, I think it's for real. I did some stupid things... I don't want to die painfully in the hospital. When it comes to pain, we're even, right? Weren't you married? I was. That fucker... I'm sorry! Dear Lord, please forgive me. How could I say such nasty words. I can't believe I said 'fuck'. Dang it. I should've swore some more. Eun-ah, don't feel so bad. You still own so much, and plenty to share. I own so much... What could they be? Healthy body. Due to my cancer, I can't even donate my organs. There are so many people in need of that. Imagine their desperation. Compared to me, you're blessed. Organ trade If you're trying to threaten me for what... Not a threat, but a trade. Trade with me? I need a list. Like your kid, people with same blood type, desperate for organs. You know what? I don't know what you're scheming, but even bringing up such idea is illegal! What you tried... was legal by your definition? This plan requires 5 people, including myself. Organ transplant waiting list This plan requires 5 people, including myself. Rh-O / Kidney First. Someone who can uncover him. A hacker or programmer who can retrieve data. Cornea A hacker or programmer who can retrieve data. Second. Someone who can verify him, and shadow him. A cop or a detective would do. Liver Liver Third. Someone who can capture him and bring him to me. Ex-SWAT or martial arts expert. Lastly. Someone who can perform the transplants. He must be a doctor. What do I get for this list? Your child's life. There aren't any perfect matches. They're the closest. Patient record Why can't you take care of yourself while I'm away?! Goddammit! Give me your arm! You gotta take painkillers regularly, remember? Get up. You still need food, even in the face of death. Death? For your own good? Who made me this way?! Shush! I'll do better, eat your food. Go on, hit me, you fucking asshole! Taking care of you made me this way. Kill me while you can, fuckface! What a potty mouth. I gotta go to work, I took out bones from this fish. You need food to take meds. And meds to get better. Finish your meal, okay? Hello? Let go! I know they're cutting line! The poor and the weak must all die waiting for transplant? Let go, assholes! - You're under arrest for adultery. - I'm so sorry, honey! Officer, gather evidence. That condom too. You wanted the divorce for him? I know you want the land, take everything. Why are you wearing our kid's school uniform? Nurse Why are you wearing our kid's school uniform? Officer! Hey! I'm at work, I'm not gonna flee! What are you doing with a sick woman! Mom, are you nuts? You should be in the hospital! Get up. Mom, are you hurt? I wanted to make you side dishes that you like before I die. My cooking isn't what it used to be. Mom, please... Please! Mom! You won't die. I'm going to save you. I'll save you... no matter what! Are you Mr. BAEK? The cornea applicant. Why is the interest rate so different? I'm not saying I won't pay... That's not what I'm saying! Do whatever you want! I see that your tissues and blood type match, but I want to do it legally. Do I look so gullible? I won't fall for this scam! Don't fucking joke with human lives! Don't give me this shit! Fuck off! Before I fucking slap you. No! Why should I meet them?! It's your job to convince them! How dare you, you know what position I hold? Position? I'm giving away everything. If you want to save you kid, you must too. What if just one of them bails out, and goes to the police? No! I can't! Medical Doctor License Will you stop that? I vetted him, and he really is a doctor here. So how much? Once again, money is not what I want. Do one thing and my mother gets transplant right away? That's right. I'm used to scammers like you. Now you bring in a doctor? His daughter'll get my organ too. I know there's nowhere for you to turn. Please decide here and now. - What the fuck... - No shit? What do I have to do? Find the IP location? I gave you work to pay off the debt, and you moonlight? It's not like that, sir. This is extremely important. Important? Extremely important... Show me how important. Shit... Mrs. KO? Write this down. PARK Kyung-su, Gangnam, Chungdam, 141-8. Who is this guy? Hey, PARK Kyung-su!

Woman, you got the wrong guy, right?! Shit! I knew it, untie me! Let me go! Untie me, what are you doing?! Are you nuts?! Stop that! What are you doing? Is this some kind of bondage sex fetish? Blood'll drain faster if you get excited. Drain what? Are you from Red Cross? Holy shit! Let's talk about this, okay? Shit, that's cold... Was it last Saturday? I was valet parking, and it's a customer's. Be precise. When? Sat... Saturday for sure! Time? It was during shift change, so 8:30! Yeah! How did he look? Wait, it's coming back to me! About 180cm tall, soft features that girls like, but I'm not into that... He had this aura about him... like he was an artist somehow. Hard to explain, he's not really my type... Where was it?

Okay, see you tomorrow. 80% of the people on the waiting list die, 80%! My wife could die any day now. Doing the surgery after catching him, or before, it's same shit. We're all only after the results. Right? This was your idea from the beginning. Eun-ah, I was thinking... Who...? He works with me. - I was passing by... - Welcome, come in! Have you had lunch? Please join us. - I shouldn't... - Come in, it's okay. I don't really like curry... Bless, oh Lord... this food to our use and us to thy service, and thank you for bringing... What is your name? JANG Dae-ho... Thank you for bringing angelic Mr. JANG to us. For all we're about to receive, make us truly grateful. Through Jesus Christ we pray. - Amen. - Amen. Have a great meal, I'll be off. I'll see you again. Okay... Is there a problem? I was just passing by. Taxi van's here. Going to West Seoul, right? I'm here, Ms. PARK. Which room? What the hell! Let go! Let go! Careful, she's valuable. Paying debt with organs. Smart, Ms. PARK. If it wasn't for mom's illness, I wouldn't have used a loanshark. Ms. PARK! Must you have done this? My mom's dying before me, and you want me to run your errands? And get fucked around by the perverted boss? Do I look stupid? As promised, I want one kidney. That's for mom. I'm off. She's the interest. You're the principal. Chairman. Mr. BAEK, I got some fresh merchandise. Not just 1, but 2. Of course, it's fresh! Sell off one of them, but the other is one of a kind, a rare blood type. Say what? We're both pros, I know the street value too. Don't fucking cut in! Get in line, asshole! It's a sure thing, prep for surgery! We got a donor! It just happened! Where are you?! Motherfucker! Wait, what's wrong? You used that bitch to stab me in the back! I didn't tell her to do anything! I'll fucking skin you, asshole! So you had other plans. What is it? Why am I here? Who the fuck are you? How many fucks are involved? Motherfucker! Wait... Once I swallow this, all my organs will be contaminated. And your fate would be different. For your own safety, I never wanted you all to come together... But that's... out of the question now. Well... Don't look away. Look at me. Please help... Officer. Please help... Yes. Right now, hurry! Right now, officer! Officer, please help... Okay, we'll be right there. Please help... - Could you put your mom on? - Please help... Officer... So who's there now? Put your mom on. Mom... Mom... Mom... That's where my husband died. This is what the asshole did. You all have a chance to save your family, but I never had that. I'll find him, even if it's just me. So leave now if you must. Over here? Keep going. Good, stop. What'll do with it? Just do it. CCTV and phone records. So what's all this for? Tell me! Just do it! Don't shout at me. I went to engineering school. You should get it patented. I hope it cuts well. It has to be slow and painful. All I have to do is catch him, and tie him up here, right? Okay, where is he? Wait there. It's so cool here, what do you do? Gonna wash up first? No bed either. You must be into kinky stuff. Swallow.

Sometimes you get cancer, and end up carving out your breast. My husband couldn't even kill a pest, my child... she was... only 14 years old. If there is a God, and if He condoned the killer's actions, then I will... kill Him too... All killers end up in hell. This... is hell to me. It's my lucky charm. It made living in hell bearable.

All alone. 2 people have died! People are dead! No one has any good ideas? He's not an ordinary killer. He carves dolls out of human bones. I should've handled it on my own. This is... where we part. We die one way or another. We should've had a cute daughter. Baby bear! What's wrong? Dad... You look terrible. No girls will like you. When you remarry, I'll be able to rest easy.
