In the years between 1825 and 1841, when California was a province of Mexico, it was torn by internal strife. Britain, France, and Russia tried to gain a foothold in this land... but it was the Czar of Russia who established settlements at Fort Ross, Kuskoff, and Bodega Bay. Czarist power on the North American continent reached its height when Princess Helena de Gagarin, niece of the Czar of Russia, accompanied by Russian officers, christened a mountain in Northern California in honor of the Empress of Russia's patron saint, Helena. But the Czar had net considered the people of California, who wanted freedom. One must look at governments with the eye of a connoisseur, Juan. A government is like good food. Put in the right ingredients, and you have a dish that sits well on everyone's stomach. Si, Don Arturo. The wrong things can make a country sick, put in a pinch of something good here, pinch of something else here, another pinch here... and what have you got? Enchiladas? Freedom! Freedom, Juan. A country of freedom that sits well on everyone's stomach. And is the United States freedom the kind that sits on everyone's stomach? The freedom of the United States is something you will soon taste, Juan. Already I have made many of my countrymen hungry for it. Perhaps this very night, you will begin to cook. What we have here should add spice to the dish. It is a good thing no one knows what kind of spice you got there, Don Arturo... Aye. or we might never reach the Reina de Los Angeles. Santa Maria. Andele! Vamanos! Juan, quick! Your rope. Lets pull out the bridge supports. Now, we can ride as gentlemen should. Who were those sons of the devil who dare to do this to José Martinez? Who saw their faces? They never let us get close enough, José. What about the rest of you? So not only they get away from us, but the saddlebag with the gold, too. The gringo lovers, they will pay for this. After the beautiful reception we will give to Mr. John Frémont this afternoon, we will take what that gold was going to buy. Let's go. Come on, you bushwhackers, get going, get 'em inside. You want to get paid, don't you? These crates have to be unloaded before sundown. If that is the way American women look, Don Arturo, maybe it is better not to have freedom. I'm sorry, señor, I was in the back and I... Oh, the American Star, eh? Si, I am Don Arturo Bordega, Very glad to see you, Don Arturo. Is the gold safe? Enough to buy all the guns in the stock of señor Lawrence. If only the American government can see it our way, we will know tonight. Any news of Frémont? Not a word, yet, señor, but there are other people in town. Don Carlos de Reno, Don Herectos Abrillo, Don Junipero, Don Fredo Brios and his brother, The Brios brothers. From what I know of them, we would be better off without them. It is too bad that so many trust them, señor, but if they... Please, senor! Please! My servant. - That's Ernesto Brio, sir. - Mercy, señor. Promise, I will never do it again, señor. Mercy! Please! Mercy, señor. What is all this tumult? You screech loud enough to turn my wine to vinegar. Master, it was not my fault. Your dog of a peon sputtered dust on me. You see, Juan, if this were a land of progress, you peons wouldn't always be brawling. Peons? By the saints! Whoa, boys, whoa. Put away that pig-sticker, señor. Seems like every time someone pulls one of those in this part of the country, a revolution starts. Well, what's wrong with revolution, señorita? They break the monotony, and California has a brand new governor. I've heard that even this gentleman would like to be governor. Hmm? Is that so? Seems to me if I were a young man, I'd want a job with a future to it. Are you an American? Yes, any objections? If there are, my blade have forgotten your insults, Don Arturo. Remember that... if you should choose to make any more. At the right time, I shall be most delighted to lose my memory. Aren't swords a little old-fashioned, señor? Tradition dies hard. I wonder if we Americans will ever understand your people. You don't have to. It's more important that we understand you. Perhaps, we shall have a good beginning at the ball tonight? Adiós, señorta. Everything all right, all right, Julie? Sure, pop. Plates are all intact, nothing broken. If this territory keeps on building, we're going to have to enlarge that factory. That's sure. Build a better gun, there'll always be somebody who wants to shoot it off. Eh, long as there ain't no ruckus, nobody get hurt. Hey, when you gonna start to gettin' ready for that shindig tonight? Pop, you know how I feel about getting all dressed up like a Calvary horse. Oh, you'll wear your best dress. You know I always say, "when you do something, do it right." You'll never get a husband wearing them things. What's the matter? Don't I do a good job around here? What do I need a husband for? Now, you're old enough to know the answer to that yourself. You wear that dress. Hey, pop, there's something funny going on here. I mean, this isn't just a ball tonight, is it? There's something more important. You might as well know: Captain John Frémont's going to be there. John Frémont? The American explorer? Been a kind of a secret. Things're popping, Julia. Oh, what did he want here? I don't know, all I know is a couple of weeks ago, Don Esteban Mirana asked me if I'd like to see California join the Union, and when I said, "sure," he just kind of smiled, went on about his business. There's something in the wind. Hey, I've got to wait late at the shop tonight, and you're going to be at the ball, and you'll be dancing. Maybe you could do some listening, too. Hmm? It's a big country, Don Esteban. A beautiful country. A country ripe for progress, Captain Frémont. And am I supposed to represent progress? You are an explorer, and an American. Neither one has ever entered a new land to... take anything away, just to bring something. Why not let the people of California choose their own form of government? Technically, we are part of Mexico. The seat of the Mexican government is over 2,500 miles away from us, and besides, Mexico has her own troubles. So we are left to shift for ourselves, practically independent territory. So, how to choose? Elections such as yours? The peónes know nothing of government, sir, and care less. José! The coach is coming. That's the one. And remember, no one gets away alive. They're going to be disappointed in any valuables they find on me. Perhaps it is yourself that is so valuable to them, capfián. It is a hard country in which to keep a secret. Perhaps you... Don Esteban! There will be no guest of honor at the meeting, tonight. It gets late. You suppose the guest of honor has been detained? Unavoidably detained. You will make a handsome governor, and I will have a brother in high office. Ah, well. The father is Sam Lawrence. So... an interesting development. Stay away from her, Fredo. We can afford no complications. You had best watch your own complications, Ernesto. Don Arturo Bordega is as good a swordsman as you. Señorita Lawrence? Yes? I am Don Fredo Brios. How do you do? The music is inviting. If you would do me the honor, señorita? Thank you, I don't feel like dancing. But they say that music is exhilarating and refreshing as a good glass of cool water. Hmm, it depends on how thirsty you are. You have much to learn, señor One never offers a beautiful woman water, when what she really wants is wine. Will you forgive my dear for taking so long to bring your wine? You looking for another duel? When a man meets a pretty girl, it's automatically a duel. Do you know who that was? Not your husband, I hope. No. Don Fredo Brios. The brother of the man who wanted to stick a sword in you this afternoon. Then I'm glad he's not your husband. May I ask you a personal question? Go ahead. Why were you wearing those... horrible things you had on when I first met you? They cover me, don't they? That's the trouble. Too well. Don't bother to dwell on it. I prefer to dwell on the way you look now. Don Arturo, if you can come to the library, he's here. You know it is important, or I would not leave you. Will I see you later? That depends, Don... Good, then I will see you. Captain Frémont, this is Don Arturo Bordega, our leader. I've heard of the Bordega Family, I'm honored, sir. We are honored, señor. The name of Frémont means much in California, also. You had an accident? I managed to reach the mission where Fray Lindos attended me, but, uh, it wasn't an accident. ...Attack Arturo, but there was no attempt at robbery. - My uncle was killed. - But who? Captain Frémont thinks the attack might have some... political meaning. I can only presume there are people in your country who did not wish me to reach this meeting tonight. Our little light begins to dawn, señores. I too was attacked this afternoon. I thought it was merely the bandits who usually prey on rich hildagos. I was carrying gold to buy guns for our cause. They way these bandits knew that my gold represented guns is the same way that they knew that you, too, represented guns. Well, they could have saved themselves the trouble. Gentlemen, you must understand the United States knows the value of California, as do the English, the French, and the Russians. Naturally, we're very pleased that you wish annexation of California to our country. But, we cannot give you physical aid. Arms, ammunition, soldiers, and a fleet to implement it. Mexico is a neighbor and a friend, and by treaty, California is Mexican territory. My country will do nothing to rupture relations with Mexico. But señor we are the people of California. And we want the annexation. Perhaps, señor Frémont is in a position to say what, uh, proposition the United States would be willing to offer us to, uh, well, to turn California over to his country. You misunderstood, señor Brios, I did not come here to bargain. I came to present a few simple truths. United States is not interested in your revolutions, or in your internal wars. When you can show that a majority of your people are in favor of annexation, my country will be willing to discuss this thing further. Now, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I'm very tired. My thanks, Fray Lindos. You are either very stupid, or very clever, Don Ernesto. You're very stupid if you meant what you said to señor Frémont. You're very clever if you meant to drive him from this room. Well, which is it? You question that I am loyal to this party? I question the integrity of anything you do. No, thank you. Excuse me. Ah, señorita, You didn't like what happened at the meeting, did you? You're fit, and ready for a fight. Well, sometimes the truth hurts. He's a man of plain truths and plain words, this señor Frémont. And he's here? Yes, he's here. He will be dangerous, Ernesto. He's the only one who'll fight for what he wants. Take away the leader from the mob, there is no mob. You must forgive me, señorita. I want only to tell you how beautiful you are, and instead I bore you with politics. Don Arturo! I, for one, do not find your talk of politics boring. You chose the most inopportune time to, uh, lose your memory, and insult me before your friends. Here? Yes. Here and now. I'm sorry. Amigo? Have you had enough, señor? Not until I've run you through. Don Fredo, you must... you must stop them. It is an affair of honor, Padre. I have no right. Ernesto! You can deal with me now, Don Arturo. Isn't one death enough, señores? What is it? What is happening? Hold. Take everything you can carry. Juan.Juan, are you badly hurt? It is nothing, Don Arturo. Like the sting of a bee. That is all. It... Quick, we've got to get the horses out and escape. There are no horses. They've cut them loose. But who are these bandits who want only guns? If I was to bet, and I'll wager 5,000 pesos, you find out who tried to kill John Frémont. Pop! José Martinez. What does it mean, Arturo? All this killing, this stealing of weapons? We wanted those guns to prevent any foreign power from trying to take California by force, but this José Martinez seems to know all our plans as quickly as we make them. Then he must be in the pay of one of these foreign governments. Yes, but which one? We must find out, and we must get the guns back. Si, but, how is this to be done? The men who staged the raid tonight were peons. Bandits. We are taught that water seeks its own level. So? A peon among peons is not a suspicious character. He can come and go where he chooses with his mouth closed and his eyes and ears open. This José Martinez is the key to the door of this mystery. I must get that key in my pocket, and then find the door that it opens. YOU? Why not? But, Arturo, it could mean your life! I must ask you two favors. First that you keep the gold here till I return. Second that you pray for me every day that I do return. At least let someone go with you to help. Two makes twice as big a target. I shall pray for you, my son. Come, I'll get your clothes. We go slowly, amigo, in respect of your venerable age. Perhaps the fine air of Monterey will breathe new life into your creaking bones, eh? Well, a peon must have a peon's horse. It's a lonely life, amigo. Too bad you don't play cards. Well, perhaps if you dream of hay, and I dream of señorita Lawrence, the night will go more quickly. Buenas noches, amigo. Come out with your hands up. I expect an argument, but it won't do you any good. You're wearing those horrible pants again. Special occasions, I have a long dress that goes over these. Where did you get those eggs? I swiped 'em. I passed a ranch. Chickens didn't mind. Well, what are you doing here? I've been following you for days. That's a slow horse you've got there. Shh! Not so loud. He's sensitive. I'm going with you. You're... But don't get the idea that you and I... What I mean is, well, you're only to think of me as a man. I think of you only as my grandmother. That'll be fine, thanks. When she talks, she doesn't make sense either. I don't understand one word you are saying. I'm going to get the man that killed my father. And you're going to take me to him. You are going after this man? I heard you talking to Fray Lindos in the rectory. You have other fish to fry, but one fish will be for me. Then you know my mission. You must go back, Julia. There's too much at stake. With a woman along... There was no one in the world that knew more about guns than my father. Now that he's gone... Well, I'm top man, now. Julia, you are a very nice girl, and a very good shot, and beautiful, even in these pants, but I don't want to see you hurt. Look, lets get this straight. I'm no concern of yours. Man must have a little concern for his grandmother, no? Then we've nothing to worry about. I can take care of myself. Julia, I must find the guns which were stolen. If you insist on killing this José Martinez... We can take care of that when the time comes. My father always said, "Don't start shooting till you got something to shoot at." You are not coming with me. Oh? Well, uh, how would you like it if I went around exposing the fact that you're not a peon, but Don Arturo Bordega. You wouldn't! Yes, you would. Where do we go first? The trail of Martinez heads north. We will go, asking questions on the way. Skunk like that, we ought to just be able to follow our noses. You have a pretty nose to follow. But we will ask questions just the same. And I will do the asking. You are too ready to shoot things. No, no! We may have soup sometime. Ah. Oh. And they came charging down on my farm like as Calvary, yelling that they're liberating me from slavery, and when I tell them that I do not know what they are talking about, they hit me on the head and liberate me from my chickens and pigs. They're wolves, they're thieves! You say they went in the direction of Monterey? Sí, sí, señor, but I would like to tell them where to go. Here, amigo. For more chickens and pigs, and our thanks to you. Oh, gracias señor, gracias. Well, here we are. What do we do, now? One thing first, I am thirsty. Looks good, so am I. Ladies do not go in such places. We've been asking questions every day for the last 300 miles. I'm thirsty. My throat's like the inside of a barbeque pit. I'm going in too. That place looks better, though. The hotel, huh? Peons do not go in hotels, mi Amiga. My father always said, "Little one, hitch your wagon to a star." Fine star. Anytime you want to unhitch, señorita... Come on, amigo, I talk too much. Good. It's the only way I can tell you're really a woman. Don Fredo! Unexpected visitor. Monterey is getting a little crowded. We can't leave now, Martinez must be around. Did your father ever say to you, "The wise man who wishes to hide covers his face with the mask of night?" No. No? My father did. Come. We'll see to it that your luggage is taken to your room, Don Fredo. Any news from Martinez? None. He should be here by tonight. I'll be waiting in my room. Si, señor. Horses all right? Si, they are well-fed. Hmm. I don't what the "hmm" is about, but if you're wondering about the dress, I just did my laundry. I had no choice. Now, if whoever owns this barn doesn't come snooping around, we'll be all right. It feels good to relax. You're tired? Mmm. You shouldn't have done that, Arturo. I know. It is just you are beginning to look less like my grandmother. But, you loved your grandmother? Oh, of course, but in a different way. Hmm. I guess that means you love me too. You tricked me, señorita! I didn't want to say that. We have no time for love. All right, then. If we do have time, we'll talk about it again. That's fair. Mmm. Maybe we have a little time now. Papa always said, "Julie, when you do something, do it right." There'll be a right time to talk about it again. Mmm. We going to Monterey tonight? Might be better if you stay here, my Julia. We may have to move fast, and there's only one fast horse. Makes sense. You better take this. You have a small waist. It would fit nicely in a man's arms. Remember that, and don't get yourself killed. He's waiting for you. The second floor of the hotel, room 26. He's been here since this afternoon. Let him wait. Sí, sí. Adiós, amigo. Now that your brother's dead, Who's gonna be made the new governor? Well, that will be decided after my conference up north. Oh, maybe you, eh? It will be good. I'd like to make a business for you. Maybe you make me a big government man. Are you sure you were not followed when you stored the guns? I? Followed? Nobody follows José Martinez. Good. I shall be leaving, then. Are you quite sure all of your money is there? I'm always sure, sir, when I count it. Put up your hands, señor Stand up. Quick! Take off your gun belt. Hurry, señor. And be careful. I shoot very well. Thank you. It has been a pleasure to do business with you, señor. Don't follow too closely. Stop him! - Arturo! - Quick, inside, - We're going to have company. - Who? - José Martinez. - Martinez? Give me the gun. I'll kill him. No,no,no. He thinks he's chasing me. Thinks he is? I thought he's just out for a ride. Say nothing. It is I, Don Arturo Bordega, who is chasing him. Huh? Come out, before I waste my bullets on you. See, already he's extending an invitation. Come out with your hands up. In a moment, señor. But observe the window. My wife, who's a very good shot, might kill you. So it might be better if you put your hands up. You think you can steal the gold of José Martinez and live? José Martinez? Oh, please, señor, don't shoot. I will give you back your gold, but please do not shoot. My wife here is going to have a baby. What? Shh! Señor Martinez, I made a terrible mistake. Your gun, señor. The gun and your gold. If I had but known it was you. If you know who I am, it makes a difference? Would I steal the gold of José Martinez, friend of the people? Who, me? "Friend of the people?" Well, you are against the American gringos, no? You don't like them, huh? Señor, I work for them in Yorba Buena driving a delivery wagon, so what happens? They rob me of my salary. Me, that's about to become a family man. Your wife, she's not a Californian, no? No, señor, but she's a good woman, just the same. We are going to have 14 children. You think José Martinez's gold will help you to have 14 children? It's just one of the things, señor. How you want to make your living? That is a problem. I have always been an honest man. Now, maybe, I shall have to steal. Oh, no, I give you a job. You're riding pretty well. What about your wife? She rides better than I do, señor. Well, she want to have... Oh, that's all right. This way, when he's born, he'll already be a fine horseman. Oh, I like that. Now, let's go to the best hideout all over California. To the hacienda of Don Fredo Brios. Go and get your things. This is a fine mess you've got us in to. Well, how else could we find out what José Martinez is going to do? I should have shot him the first time I laid eyes on him. That's what you get for getting to like a man. You have to do things the way he wants them. All I can say is, my father's watching now. You better make sure you really marry me. Well, but of course, my Julia, if only for the sake of our 14 children. Now come kiss your husband good night. You stay on your own side. You know, I think maybe soon we will know what they are going to do with the guns they stole from your father. This is no small thing. This is a well-organized plot to terrorize my people. You'd give a lot to be an American, wouldn't you? Si, my Julia. Very much. Hmm. Maybe California wouldn't be such a bad place to raise 14 children after all. Hey, Pedro! Get up. Come on, boys. I got news. I just come from the home of our leader, Don Fredo. He's going north, for a very important conference. He give me a list of a man who wants to make California part of the United States. We must change their minds. We will change them. Juan Junipero, Alvarado Sabrillo, Carlo Torrero, Philipe Juaranez, Francisco Valera, Enrique Sebastiano, Arturo Bordega. This Arturo Bordega, he's the leader of these men. He will die first. Uh, senor, I have been thinking. You are already becoming famous as a friend of the people of California. Soon they will have parades in your honor, they will make fine music and hang flags, and they will shout, "Viva José Martinez friend of the people." So far, you're making sense. But will the people think of you as a friend if so many men are killed? Well, then we only kill Arturo Bordega. Si, that's enough. But the rest, we burn their farms. If they don't say, "Viva José Martinez," - we cut they throats. - Viva! All right. In the morning, we begin. Go back to sleep. I'll tell you this Arturo Bordega, he's a ghost. He's not here! We turned California upside down, and nobody see him. Seems to me, senor, we waste a great deal of time looking for this one insignificant insect. This "insect" is the fly in the soup of Don Fredo Brios, amigo. What if does become governor under Mexican rule? A few months from now, someone else will want to become governor. There will be another revolution, Don Fredo will find himself hanging from the branch of a tree. You say you don't know nothing about politics. Believe me, amigo, you don't. No, señor. You think Don Fredo Brios, or José Martinez, fight for the small stakes? No, amigo. When they have new governor in Monterey, we will not be under the Mexican rule. No? But with big power, many armies, big war ships. Oh, I did not know. I see... Who is this big power, señor? Oh... forget about it. The only thing you have to do is cut off the throat of this Arturo Bordega in the next few days. Ah. Now, go and tell your wife I'm hungry. Perhaps my brother was headstrong, but, any rate, the duel was unavoidable, but not catastrophic for the aims of Princess Helena de Gagarine, Count Russia, and the czar of all the Russias. The Czar has no territorial ends in California. Please remember that. The people of this country will have to choose who will govern them. Well, of course. My methods simply help them to choose correctly. What of this Don Arturo Bordega? He has not yet been found, but a man who continues to be absent can hardly do us any harm. He's a rallying point for the opposition. He can always do harm. The matter will be taken care of. You say you have sufficient arms and ammunition. Si. Together, we have enough arms, ammunition, men to seize the city of Monterey. There will be few to oppose us. José Martinez has done his work well. There is a fear in the heart of everyone. Very well, Don Fredo. The untimely death of your brother was, uh, unfortunate for him, but most fortunate for you. When we have Monterey, you will be named governor. You have my undying gratitude, princess. Your ranch is close enough to Monterey? Most perfectly situated. Make it your headquarters. Immediately following the attack, you'll be in the city within an hour to proclaim all of California under Russian protection. Good. We will leave at once. Very well. It will be nice to be such a close neighbor of the United States. There, amigos, are your new comrades in arms. They dress like American croppers and rancheros. Smart, huh? Here's the escort to pick up the guns. Without José Martinez they wouldn't march at all. Because without me, they could never have the proper implements to establish a government. Guns, amigo, they are proper implements for politics. Now, we go back to the camp, and wait for the orders. Soon we'll meet those fine soldiers alone. I'm going to start an argument with you. Be very angry. I'll explain later. What are you cooking in there? Old saddles? What's wrong with my cooking? Everything! Everything? You used to like my cooking, and now you do nothing but complain. Can't a man complain when he's being poisoned every day? "Poisoned?" "Poisoned," he says. I burn my hands aver that pot to give him something to eat, and he says I poison him! The stew might taste better if you kept your hands out of it. Why, you overstuffed beetle! Maybe the stew would taste better with your gizzard in it! Don't overdo it. Hey, un momento, Chiquita. Why? Hey, wait a minute, what kind of a girl you marry? You are right. Instead of building her a house, I should build her a cage. That stew had perfectly good meat in it. Wait, wait. Go back to your cooking. And you, come over before she kill you. Saddle cooker! The argument gives you reason to leave. Warn Monterey, my Julia. Tell them to send messengers the length of California. Somewhere there must be men with courage enough to fight. Gold. You will need it to take care of yourself. What about you if I leave? Soon as I find out where the guns are, I will be with you, again. Be careful getting there. When I am with a sentry, go. I could not sleep. With a wife like that, one should not argue. She's a pretty good fighter, eh? Some day, you will wake up dead. Oh, on a night like this, one should not speak of dying. The night wears its stars the way a woman wears her jewels. You take the stars, I will take the jewels. Uh, cigarillo? Pedro, go get her. Andele, burros. I told you, he was shooting at my wife. She was running away because of the argument. You saw it. So? Oh! You get your wife back. So, you wanted to leave me, eh? You wanted to leave the best husband a woman could ever find, eh? She had this with her, José. And it has much gold. Where did she get it? How should I know? She stole it, probably. Well? Yes, I stole it. You see? Oh, let me see. You run away, have gold, you hit Fernando. You think Martinez have a mind of a child? Cut him off. Igna'cio, the bull whip. Si. Maybe he talks. The bull whip. Ain't that the truth, eh José? Give old camarad a taste. José Martinez. "Hero of the people." You fool. They think you're a murderer, with the mind of a pig. Julia. Put your hands up, all of you. Now, cut him loose. So a woman gets in the way, huh? One more step, Martinez, and you'll know just how my father felt. Your father? The one you stole the guns from. The one you murdered. There's nothing to shoot, lady. We will never tell you where the guns are. Now, cut him loose. Now, you lgna'cio, where are the guns? I do not know. Now maybe you know? No! The next one will be higher. Si, the cellar of Don Fredo Brios. Julia, get the list from Martinez's pocket. Take the list and notify each of the men. That escort must never reach the guns. Bring all the help you can to the hacienda of Don Fredo Brios. Hurry, querida. Now, turn all around, all of you. Throw your guns into the bushes. Do not try to be brave, amigos, I shoot very straight. And now, amigos, Don Arturo Bordega bids you "Adiós." "Arturo Bordega?" Fernando, take your men. Go to our friends, the Russians, and tell them they must hurry to pick up the guns. Quick. Si, lgna'cio. Muchachos. We will cut through the ravine, and get to the hacienda before him. Governor Alvarado, ever since this José Martinez has been raiding our ranches, we've been trying to find him. Now we find that he's up here in the vicinity of Monterey. We brought a small force of men with us, but it is not enough to search the entire area. We want troops to help us. But I have no troops, señores. There is only one regiment, many hundreds of miles away. In Baja California. And you leave the capitol unguarded? There you have it, amigos. The more of this kind of government we get, the more we are sure we need a change. - Señores! - Governor! Let her in, Carlos! Oh, it's good to see you, señores. I didn't mean to interrupt, but Don Bernardo, Arturo is in trouble. A Russian force is marching to the estate of Don Fredo Brios. Brios! My father's guns that were stolen are stored in the cellar of Don Fredo Brios. He was the spy among us, he knew all our plans. But these Russians... They'll take the guns to an army, waiting to attack Monterey. Arturo will try to stop them, but he's all alone. Oh, our force is a small one, but we'll do all we can. Come, señores, we'll go and find some help. I dare say this is the most pleasant protectorate we've ever established. Thanks to your excellent planning and hospitality, Don Fredo. I believe that you will find California's hospitality second only to its natural resources, princess. Our mining engineers are already on their way here. Oh. You think of everything. The escort will reach my ranch in another hour or so, There should also be word from José Martinez. Everything goes well. To the Czar, who has no territorial ambitions in California. Alfredo! I have bad news. José Martinez is dead. He what? Killed by a woman, señor. The daughter of this man, Sam Lawrence. She's going to Monterey to give them warning. And even now, Arturo Bordega is on his way here to stop us. So, it is Arturo Bordega again. Post your men around the hacienda. See that no one enters the grounds. Si, señor. Your hospitality is still excellent, Don Fredo, but I begin to worry about your planning. You will keep sharp eyes. You will let no one come in. All right, Vamos. You seem frightened, Don Fredo. I don't like trouble. Governor Alvarado has no troops in Monterey, and surely you don't think that this one man, Bordega, can stop us now. When your troops are armed and on their way to Monterey, then I will stop worrying. You drink too much wine, my friend. It has taken the place of your blood. Carlos. Si? Arturo Bordega. You will talk more quietly, señor, or you will not talk at all. Now we will pay our respects to Don Fredo. We cannot... Shh, shh. The princess is there. You forget that I have an invitation. Si. Put your hands down. Remember one wrong move... Whatever it is you are going to do, señor, you will not come out alive. We will both take our chances. Move. However, the situation can become more... lgna'cio! Say only what I've told you. Don Fredo, the soldiers are here. Perhaps it is time to move out the guns. Thank heavens! You see, Don Fredo, you live too much in the shadow of fear. I heard nothing. Where are they? They are camping in the outer pasture. Move the guns out, Governor Brios. You can argue with your man later. This is the moment, my husband. Don Fredo! I could have killed you, señor, but you are still of use. In the cellar. Quick. Faster, faster. Take a seat, amigo. No, no, no. Over there. Then you will discourage anyone from shooting into the cellar. Don Fredo! I bring help! No, do not bring anyone! And do not let anyone shoot down here. It might hit the powder. There is nothing we can do. The whole place would blow up. Stupid fool. Must leave here, quick. Thank you, amigo. I can get used to anything? Now we just sit and wait for the authorities. And we drink some wine. Take cover among the rocks, the trees, or anything. Senorita, no Russian soldiers will get near those guns now. But what of Arturo? I don't know if he's alive. But I'll find out. Julia! Wait, Julia! Junipero, you and Sabrillo and Sorena follow Miss Julia. She might need help. Find 'em. Come on! I don't know who you are, but if you live here, you must mean trouble. You wouldn't dare! Lady, this gun will shoot anybody. It's not particular. Watch these two, will you? I have to find Arturo. Si, señorita. I demand my rights. I am the Princess Helena of Gagarine. Shut up, your highness. Andele, C'mon. Señores! We have come to escort you to Brios' Hacienda. We must hasten. It is more than a mile to the east. Forward, ho! I don't know how long we can keep this up. We're running out of powder. Oh, Arturo, you're safe! Stop waving that pistol, querida, or you'll be a widow before you're a wife. Our men are down at the bottom of the hill, but the Russians have us outnumbered. I think we can even things up. Watch here. What are you gonna do with that? Sprinkle it on their tail? No, we will send it to them with our best wishes. They're going to try. This is a good time to start praying, amigos. Push,querida. If this keg goes up while we're still pushing, I want you to know I love you. Soon there'll be a ship bound for Russia with many passengers. "No territorial ambitions." You know this is a good time to start thinking about those 14 children. First, we'll get married. Of course, my Julia. You father always said, "When you do something, do it right."
