I had two options at the tattoo parlor. It could have been a frog or a medieval dragon. Yeah I know, but a frog doesn't imply what you thought that I was a bitch. Really? Yeah. Only you could draw that short line to that. I wasn't even thinking that, I didn't think it. But the medieval dragon was huge. And? And the flames were like, all the way to my fingerprints. Would you like me to have a sleeve? That would be hot. Would it? Mmhmm. It was only like, $50. [ Chuckles ] Like on the boardwalk, I was pissed off. Why? I was like, give me that wolf. Yeah? Yeah.

It's an emergency? No, I need to speak with him. I look at his photos. I have been for the past 15 years, and I when I want to say something, I tell him good or bad. I need to speak with him. If it were his mother, I would be very happy. If I were his wife, I would be very concerned. He takes photographs of dead pigeons. Well, yyou're neither. [ Dial clicks ] Hello?

The last thing I wanted was anyone that reminded me of you. But that was a joke, because ... everything reminded me of you. Every time I opened a magazine, the first thing I would do is look at the credits. To see who took the photos. What's the opposite of me? He's a carpenter. Shit. [ Laughs ] Okay, start the jokes. There's hope. Why? The boss' son was a carpenter. Yeah, well, I don't think that he would sacrifice himself for very much. Especially if it's something that doesn't benefit him. Why no babies? Because he wasn't you. Mm. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not gonna lie to you, though. I'm not thrilled listening to this. I don't exactly like telling it to you, either.

Mmhmm. How about a toad? That's a pretty big frog. I don't know, but that fucking tattoo... His name was big. Why the fuck would you tattoo his name on the inside of your thigh? Because I wanted it to be racier. Right there. Yeah? That wipes me out. Well I figured it would help, you know? Really? But, it didn't really. That's just horrible. Want to go for a walk? Yeah.

I love the way that you kiss me. You want to learn? Yeah. Do you? Yeah, no. No, I totally want to learn. No, yyyou dont have it in gear, right? No. It is green? Yeah. Then, let the clutch out, let the clutch out... Let the clutch out. Let the clutch out? Yeah. I dreamt that I was in Bali. I wanted to write. I love that you know everything about cars and bikes. Yep. Whoa. Alright? Yeah. You got it? Now what do I do? I'm gonna tell you to kick it in 2nd gear. I'm gonna push the clutch in. I swear, I think its so hot. I think I want to try it. Okay. So, what you want to do is engage the clutch. Got it. Engaging clutch. I love your lips. As I'm releasing the clutch, I'm gonna put gas. The gas, but not very much. I don't need a lot?

Very much so. You're a good father? Sometimes. I don't think I'd be winning any awards for the last few days though. I think you judge yourself too harshly. What's wrong? You don't want to do this any longer? It's just, there would be so much to overcome. Taking all my love. I'm sucking it out of you. That guy over there. Really? Yeah. I don't think... He looks like what? Like he's... staring at us. Seriously, no one's looking at us. No one could give a shit. It's like he knows. What do you think he knows. I don't even know how to answer that question. You know what? What? And if they do. What is he thinking? I think he knows about us, about what we're doing. They don't know. Saying our decisions ... He's over there. He's the owner of this, like, little booth or something. Where? Can you point? They were frowning upon us. He's what? Frowning. He's judging? He was. Quit. He's not looking at us. There's victims and innocent parties. No one in the market is looking at you, or looking at us. Well then, what do you call his expression? 'Cause he's old. Once we expose this... once make it real... When we expose it to everything... the harsh sun, disease. And they will come after us. I just don't like people staring at me. No one in that market is staring at us. We've been on our own little island. And once they come, we'll be walking around shell shocked. Love doesn't conquer. It's not some kind of a weapon you wield. And that's exactly what we'd have to do. We need a miracle. I love you. No matter how many words I use or reuse... It all ends with the same sentence. Are you trying to write yourself out of this? No. Tell me the truth. No. This is my heart. Don't. It's yours. I'm not protecting it anymore. Don't... Don't. Shit. What? Fuck... [ Whispers ] I know. Do you remember when we used to argue, what you would say? No. You'd say, let's just fuck it out. I did? Yeah. I'd like to. [ Moans ] No one will ever love me like you do. Yeah, this is her. Yeah. Okay. I love you. Yeah, I'll be. Right. Okay, bye. I love you. Hello, Sophia. [ French speaking ] [ French speaking ] Stop right here. Only for lovers. Exactly! Only for lovers.
